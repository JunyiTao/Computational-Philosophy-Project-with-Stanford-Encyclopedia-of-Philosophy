    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction: Quantifier Dependence\n\nIn mathematical prose, one can say things such as \u2018for all real\nnumbers \\(a\\) and for all positive real numbers \\(\\varepsilon\\), there\nexists a positive real number \\(\\delta\\) depending on \\(\\varepsilon\\)\nbut not on \\(a\\), such that\u2026\u2019 What is important here is\nquantifier dependence. The existential quantifier \u2018there exists\n\\(\\delta\\)\u2019 is said to depend on the universal quantifier\n\u2018for all \\(\\varepsilon\\)\u2019 but not on the universal\nquantifier \u2018for all \\(a\\).\u2019 It was an essential part of\nKarl Weierstrass\u2019s (1815\u20131897) work in the foundations of\nanalysis that he defined the notions of limit, continuity, and\nderivative in terms of quantifier\n dependence.[1]\n For a concrete example, a function \\(f : D \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}\\)\nis continuous, if for all \\(a\\) in the set \\(D\\) and for all\n\\(\\varepsilon \\gt 0\\) there exists \\(\\delta \\gt 0\\) such that for all\n\\(x\\) in \\(D\\), if \\(|x - a| \\lt \\delta\\), then \\(|f(x) - f(a)| \\lt\n\\varepsilon\\). The definition of uniform continuity is\nobtained from that of continuity by specifying that the quantifier\n\u2018there exists \\(\\delta\\)\u2019 depends only on the quantifier\n\u2018for all \\(\\varepsilon\\),\u2019 not on the quantifier\n\u2018for all\n \\(a\\).\u2019[2]\n\nIndependence friendly first-order logic (a.k.a. IF\nfirst-order logic, IF logic) was introduced by Jaakko\nHintikka and Gabriel Sandu in their article \u2018Informational\nIndependence as a Semantical Phenomenon\u2019 (1989); other early\nsources are Hintikka\u2019s booklet Defining Truth, the Whole\nTruth, and Nothing but the Truth (1991) and Sandu\u2019s Ph.D.\nthesis\n (1991).[3]\n IF first-order logic is an extension of first-order logic, involving\na specific syntactic device \u2018/\u2019 (slash, independence\nindicator), which has at the object language level the same effect as\nthe meta-level modifier \u2018but does not depend on\u2019 has in\nthe example just considered. In the notation of IF logic, the logical\nform of the statement that a function \\(f\\) is uniformly continuous\nwould be \\((\\forall a)(\\forall \\varepsilon)(\\exists \\delta /\\forall\na)(\\forall x) R\\), to be contrasted with the form of the statement\nthat \\(f\\) merely is continuous, \\((\\forall a)(\\forall\n\\varepsilon)(\\exists \\delta)(\\forall x) R\\).\n\nIn the introductory examples in the present and the following section,\nlet us confine attention to formulas in prenex form: a string\nof quantifiers followed by a quantifier-free first-order formula. If\nin a first-order sentence of such a form an existential quantifier\n\\(\\exists y\\) lies in the syntactic scope of a universal quantifier\n\\(\\forall x\\), then by the semantics \\(\\exists y\\) automatically\ndepends on \\(\\forall x\\). This is so e.g. with the sentence\n\\((\\forall x)(\\exists y) R(x, y)\\). The dependence of \\(\\exists y\\) on\n\\(\\forall x\\) means that the witness of \\(\\exists y\\) may\nvary with the value interpreting \\(\\forall x\\). In order for the\nsentence to be true in a model \\(M\\), it suffices that there be a\nfunction \\(f\\) such that \\(R(a, f(a))\\) holds in \\(M\\), for any \\(a\\)\ninterpreting \\(\\forall x\\). Such functions, spelling out the\ndependencies of witnesses for existential quantifiers on\ninterpretations of universal quantifiers, are known in logical\nliterature as Skolem\n functions.[4]\n For comparison, in the sentence \\((\\exists y)(\\forall x) R(x, y)\\)\nthe quantifier \\(\\exists y\\) does not depend on the quantifier\n\\(\\forall x.\\) For this sentence to be true in \\(M\\), one and the same\nwitness \\(c\\) for \\(\\exists y\\) must be good against any\ninterpretation \\(a\\) of \\(\\forall x\\), so that \\(R(a, c)\\) holds in\n\\(M\\). The corresponding Skolem function is a\n constant.[5]\n\nIn IF first-order logic, syntactic scopes no longer determine the\nsemantic relation of dependence. In the sentence \\((\\forall x)(\\forall\ny)(\\exists z/\\forall y) R(x, y, z)\\), for instance, \\(\\exists z\\) is\nsyntactically subordinate to both \\(\\forall x\\) and \\(\\forall y\\), but\nis marked as independent of \\(\\forall y\\), and is hence dependent only\non \\(\\forall x\\). Semantically this means that the witness of\n\\(\\exists z\\) must be given by a function taking as an argument the\ninterpretation of \\(\\forall x\\), but not that of \\(\\forall y\\). In\norder for \\((\\forall x)(\\forall y)(\\exists z/\\forall y) R(x, y, z)\\)\nto be true in \\(M\\), there must be a function \\(f\\) of one argument\nsuch that \\(R(a, b, f(a))\\) holds in \\(M\\), for any \\(a\\) interpreting\n\\(\\forall x\\) and any \\(b\\) interpreting \\(\\forall y\\).\n\nWhat is gained with the slash notation? After all, clearly\ne.g. \\((\\forall x)(\\forall y)(\\exists z/\\forall y) R(x, y,\nz)\\) is true in a model \\(M\\)\n iff[6]\n the first-order sentence \\((\\forall x)(\\exists z)(\\forall y) R(x, y,\nz)\\) is true therein. As a matter of fact, the expressive power of IF\nlogic exceeds that of first-order logic. Consider the sentence\n\\((\\forall x)(\\exists y)(\\forall z)(\\exists w/\\forall x) R(x, y, z,\nw)\\). Its truth-condition is of the following form: there are\none-argument functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) such that \\(R(a, f(a), b,\ng(b))\\) holds in \\(M\\), for any \\(a\\) interpreting \\(\\forall x\\) and\n\\(b\\) interpreting \\(\\forall\n z\\).[7]\n So the sentence is true iff the following sentence (*) containing a\nfinite partially ordered quantifier is true: \n\\[\\tag{*}\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\forall x \\exists y \\\\\n\\forall z \\exists w\n\\end{matrix}\nR(x,y,z,w)\n\\]\n\n\nFor, by definition (*) is true in a model \\(M\\) iff the second-order\nsentence \\((\\exists f)(\\exists g)(\\forall x)(\\forall z) R(x, f(x), z,\ng(z))\\) is true therein. The latter may be termed the Skolem\nnormal form of (*). It says that Skolem functions providing\nwitnesses for the quantifiers \\(\\exists y\\) and \\(\\exists w\\) in (*)\nexist. Finite partially ordered quantifiers \u2013 a.k.a. Henkin\nquantifiers or branching quantifiers \u2013 were\nproposed by Leon Henkin (1961) and have been subsequently studied\n extensively.[8]\n They are two-dimensional syntactic objects \n\\[\\begin{matrix}\nQ_{11} \\ldots Q_{1n} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nQ_{m1} \\ldots Q_{mn}\n\\end{matrix}\\]\n\n\nwhere each \\(Q_{ij}\\) is either \\(\\exists x_{ij}\\) or \\(\\forall\nx_{ij}\\). They are naturally interpreted by making systematic use of\nSkolem functions.\n\nLet us denote by \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) the logic of finite partially\nordered quantifiers obtained from first-order logic as follows: if\n\\(\\phi\\) is a first-order formula and \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is a finite\npartially ordered quantifier, then \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\phi\\) is a formula of\n \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\).[9]\n With \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) it is possible to express properties that are\nnot definable in first-order logic. The first example was provided by\nAndrzej Ehrenfeucht (cf. Henkin 1961): a sentence that is true in a\nmodel iff the size of its domain is infinite. It turns out that\n\\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) can be translated into IF logic (see\nSubsect. 4.1). Therefore IF logic is more expressive than\nfirst-order logic.\n\nThe deepest reason for IF logic, as Hintikka saw it, is that the\nrelations of dependence and independence between quantifiers\nare the only way of expressing relations of dependence and independence\nbetween variables on the first-order level (Hintikka 1996:\n34\u201335, 73\u201374; 2002a: 404\u2013405; 2006a: 71, 515). To\nunderstand this remark properly, recall that relations of quantifier\n(in)dependence are semantic relations, but syntactically\nexpressed. More precisely, in IF logic the (in)dependence\nrelations are syntactically expressed by the interplay of two factors:\nsyntactic scope and the independence indicator \u2018/\u2019. In a\ngiven sentence, an existential quantifier \\(\\exists x\\), say, depends\non precisely those universal quantifiers within whose scope \\(\\exists\nx\\) lies, but of which \\(\\exists x\\) is not marked as independent\nusing the slash sign. What Hintikka means when he speaks of\n(in)dependence relations between variables, are functional\ndependencies between quantities in a model. The kinetic energy of\na material body depends on its mass and its speed, but does not depend\non the particular material body being considered. This fact can be\nexpressed in IF logic by the sentence\n\n\\((\\forall b)(\\forall m)(\\forall v)(\\exists e/\\forall b)\\)(if \\(b\\) is\na material body which moves at the velocity \\(v\\) and has the mass\n\\(m\\), then the kinetic energy \\(e\\) of \\(b\\) equals \\(\\frac{1}{2}\nmv^2 )\\). \n\nThat this sentence states the existence of a functional dependence of\nkinetic energy on mass and speed is particularly clearly seen from the\nfact that if the sentence is true, the unique Skolem function for the\nquantifier \\(\\exists e\\) actually is the physical law\nconnecting masses, speeds and kinetic energies (cf. Hintikka 1996:\n34\u201335).\n\nWhile first-order logic can only express some relations between\nvariables, IF first-order logic with its greater expressive power can\nexpress more. Actually, IF logic is calculated to capture all such\nrelations (Hintikka 1996: 75\u201377; 2002a: 404\u2013405; 2002b:\n197; 2006a: 72). This idea must, in its full generality, be seen as\nprogrammatic. For a more general framework, cf. Hintikka (2006a: 515,\n536, 752; 2008), Sandu & Sevenster (2010), Sandu (2013), Sandu\n(2014).\n\nAmong philosophical issues that have been addressed in connection with\nIF logic are the reconstruction of mathematical reasoning on the\nfirst-order level (Hintikka 1996, 1997), definability of a\nself-applied truth predicate (Hintikka 1991, 1996, 2001; Sandu 1998),\ntruth and axiomatic set theory (Hintikka 1996, 2004a), and insights\ninto the nature of negation (Hintikka 1991, 1996, 2002; Hintikka &\nSandu 1989; Sandu 1994). These issues will be discussed in\nSections 4 and 5.\n2. The Background of IF Logic: Game-theoretical Semantics\n2.1. Semantic games\n\nInspired by Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s idea of a language-game,\nHintikka (1968) introduced the basic framework of what came to be\nknown as game-theoretical semantics (a.k.a. GTS). The basic\nlesson Hintikka adopts from Wittgenstein is that words \u2013 in\nparticular quantifiers \u2013 are associated with activities that\nrender them meaningful: words often have meaning only in the context\nof certain types of action (Hintikka 1968: 55\u201356). Wittgenstein\nsaid that by \u2018language-game\u2019 he means \u2018the whole,\nconsisting of language and the actions into which it is woven\u2019\n(Wittgenstein 1953: I, Sect. 7).\n\nIt becomes natural to ask which are the activities that go together\nwith quantifiers. As Hintikka explains (see Hintikka 2006a: 41, 67),\nWittgenstein had taken it as a criterion for something to be an object\nthat it can be looked for and found. Applying this idea to quantifiers\nwith such objects as values, Hintikka was led to formulate\nsemantic games for quantifiers. Crucially, these semantic\ngames can be formulated as games in the strict sense of game theory;\nbut at the same time they are exact codifications of language-games in\nWittgenstein\u2019s sense, at least if one accepts that the\nactivities associated with quantifiers are \u2018looking for\u2019\nand\n \u2018finding.\u2019[10]\n\nSemantic games \\(G(\\phi , M)\\) for first-order sentences \\(\\phi\\) are\ntwo-player zero-sum games of perfect information, played on a given\nmodel \\(M\\). Let us call the two players simply player 1 and player\n 2.[11]\n The games are most easily explained for sentences in prenex form.\nUniversal quantifiers mark a move of player 1, while existential\nquantifiers prompt a move by player 2. In both cases, the relevant\nplayer must choose an individual from the domain \\(\\rM\\) of\n \\(M\\).[12]\n If \n\\[\n\\phi = (\\forall x)(\\exists y)(\\forall z)(\\exists w) R(x, y, z, w),\n\\]\n\n\nthe game is played as follows. First, player 1 picks out an individual\n\\(a\\), whereafter player 2 chooses an individual \\(b\\). Then player 1\nproceeds to choose a further individual \\(c\\), to which player 2\nresponds by picking out an individual \\(d\\). Thereby a play of the\ngame has come to an end. The tuple \\((a, b, c, d)\\) of individuals\nchosen determines the winner of the play. If the quantifier-free\nformula \\(R(a, b, c, d)\\) holds in \\(M\\), player 2 wins, if not,\nplayer 1 wins.\n\nThe fact that one of the players wins a single play of game \\(G(\\phi ,\nM)\\) does not yet tell us anything about the truth-value of the\nsentence \\(\\phi\\). Truth and falsity are characterized in terms of the\nnotion of winning strategy. The sentence \\((\\forall\nx)(\\exists y)(\\forall z)(\\exists w) R(x, y, z, w)\\) is true\nin \\(M\\) if there is a winning strategy for player 2 in the game just\ndescribed: a recipe telling player 2 what to do, when (a specified\namount of) information about the opponent\u2019s earlier moves is\ngiven. Technically, the requirement is that there be strategy\nfunctions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), such that for any choices \\(a\\) and\n\\(c\\) by player \\(1, R(a, f(a), c, g(a, c))\\) holds in \\(M\\). Observe\nthat strategy function \\(f\\) is a Skolem function for the quantifier\n\\(\\exists y\\) in \\(\\phi\\), and similarly \\(g\\) is a Skolem function\nfor the quantifier \\(\\exists w\\). The sentence \\(\\phi\\) is\nfalse in \\(M\\) if there is a winning strategy (set of\nstrategy functions) for player 1 in the corresponding game: a constant\n\\(c\\) and a function \\(h\\) such that for any choices \\(b\\) and \\(d\\)\nby player \\(2, R(c, b, h(b), d)\\) fails to hold in \\(M\\).\n\nGame-theoretical interpretation of quantifiers was already suggested by\nHenkin (1961; cf. Hintikka 1968: 64). Henkin also pointed out, in\neffect, the connection between a full set of Skolem functions and a\nwinning strategy for player 2. Hintikka (1968) noted that conjunctions\nare naturally interpreted by a choice between the two conjuncts, made\nby player 1; similarly, disjunctions can be interpreted by a choice by\nplayer 2 between the two\n disjuncts.[13]\n Further, Hintikka proposed to interpret negation as a transposition\nof the roles of \u2018verifier\u2019 and \u2018falsifier\u2019\n(for more details, see Subsect. 3.2). \n\nThe game-theoretical description of semantic games does not mention\nthe activities of searching and finding; for such an abstract\ndescription it suffices to speak of the players making a move. Also,\nthe characterization of truth and falsity as the existence of a\nwinning strategy for player 2 and player 1, respectively, does not\nrefer to efforts on the part of the players \u2013 say efforts to\nestablish truth or to find witnesses. The truth or falsity of a\nsentence is a matter of \u2018combinatorics\u2019: it is an issue of\nthe existence of a set of functions with certain properties (cf.\nHintikka 1968, 1996; Hodges 2013). So what happened to the original\nphilosophical conception according to which the meanings of\nquantifiers are tied to the activities of searching and finding?\nHintikka\u2019s idea is that asserting a sentence involving\nquantifiers is to make a claim about what can and what cannot happen\nwhen a certain language-game is played; using language involving\nquantifiers requires mastering the rules of the corresponding semantic\ngames (Hintikka 1968: Sect. 8, 1996: 128, 2006a: 538). What\nis the content of such a claim in connection with the sentence\n\\(\\forall x\\exists y R(x, y)\\)? That whichever individual player 1\nchooses from the domain for \\(\\forall x\\), player 2 can find a witness\nindividual for \\(\\exists y\\). In other words, given a value for\n\\(\\forall x\\) (which itself can be seen as the result of the search by\nplayer 1), if player 2 is allowed to search free from any practical\nconstraints, she will find a value for \\(\\exists y\\) so that player 2\nwins the resulting play. Even though semantic games themselves can be\ndefined without recourse to activities such as looking for or finding,\nthese activities play an important conceptual role when the language\nuser reasons about these games.\n\nHintikka (1973a) initiated the application of GTS to the study of\nnatural language. This work was continued notably by Hintikka &\nKulas (1983, 1985), where game-theoretical rules for such items as\nnegation, anaphoric pronouns, genitives, tenses, intensional verbs,\ncertain prepositional constructions, and proper names were given, and\nthe distinction between abstract meaning and strategic meaning\n drawn.[14]\n\n2.2. Imperfect information\n\nThe framework of GTS enables asking questions of a game-theoretical\nnature about semantic evaluation. Hintikka (1973a) observed that\nsemantic games with imperfect information are devised without any\ndifficulty. As logical examples he used \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) sentences.\n(For examples related to natural languages, see Subsect.\n5.4.)\n\nFrom the vantage point of GTS, independence friendly first-order logic\ndiffers from first-order logic in that semantic games correlated with\nformulas of the former are, in general, games of imperfect\ninformation, while any game associated with a first-order formula is a\ngame of perfect information. Consider the game for \\(\\forall x\\exists\ny\\forall z(\\exists w/\\forall x) R(x, y, z, w)\\), played on a model\n\\(M\\). A play of this game proceeds exactly as plays of the game\ncorresponding to \\(\\forall x\\exists y\\forall z\\exists w R(x, y, z,\nw)\\). First, player 1 chooses an individual \\(a\\), whereafter player 2\nchooses an individual \\(b\\). Then player 1 proceeds to pick out a\nfurther individual \\(c\\), to which player 2 responds by choosing an\nindividual \\(d\\). So a play of the game has come to an end. The play\nis won by player 2, if indeed \\(R(a, b,c, d)\\) holds in \\(M\\);\notherwise it is won by player 1. But \\(\\exists w\\) was marked as\nindependent of \\(\\forall x\\) \u2013 why does not this fact show in\nany way in the course of a play?\n\nOne might be tempted to add to the description of a play:\n\u2018player 2 chooses a value for \\(\\exists w\\) in ignorance of the\nvalue for \\(\\forall x\\).\u2019 However, such a paraphrase would not\nclarify the conceptual situation. It makes no sense to speak of the\nindependence of a move from other given moves with reference to a\nsingle play; this can only be done with reference to a multitude of\nplays. Quantifier independence can be conceptualized in\ngame-theoretical terms making use of the notion of strategy.\nIn the example, a strategy of player 2 is a set \\(\\{f, g\\}\\) of\nstrategy functions, function \\(f\\) providing a value for \\(\\exists y\\)\ndepending on the value of \\(\\forall x\\), and function \\(g\\) providing\na value for \\(\\exists w\\) depending on the value chosen for \\(\\forall\nz\\) but not on the value chosen for \\(\\forall x\\). The strategy \\(\\{f,\ng\\}\\) is, then, a winning strategy for player 2, iff \\(R(a, f(a), c,\ng(c))\\) holds in \\(M\\), for all values \\(a\\) chosen for \\(\\forall x\\)\nand \\(c\\) chosen for \\(\\forall z\\). One precise way of implementing\nthe idea that player 2 is \u2018ignorant\u2019 of the move player 1\nmade for \\(\\forall x\\) is to say that (a) strategy\nfunctions always only take as arguments the opponent\u2019s moves,\nand (b) the strategy function corresponding to\n\\(\\exists w\\) may not take as its argument the move player 1 made for\n\\(\\forall x\\).\n\nA sentence of IF first-order logic is by definition true in a model\n\\(M\\) iff there is a winning strategy for player 2 in the correlated\ngame, and false iff there is a winning strategy for player 1 in the\ncorrelated game. There are sentences which under these criteria are\nneither true nor false; they are called non-determined (see\nSubsect. 3.3).\n\nIn Hintikka\u2019s judgement, the game-theoretical semantics of\nquantifiers can be taken to have the same rationale that was mentioned\nas the deepest reason for IF first-order logic at the end of\nSection 1: GTS is a method of representing, on the\nfirst-order level, the (in)dependence relations between variables by\nmeans of informational (in)dependence in the sense of game theory\n(Hintikka 1991: 12\u201313, 2006a: 535).\n3. The Syntax and Semantics of IF First-order Logic\n\nIn the literature one can find essentially different formulations of\n\u2018IF first-order logic.\u2019 The differences are not restricted\nto syntax \u2013 examples of applying different semantic ideas can be\nfound as well. \n\nAs already noted, there is a systematic connection between the Skolem\nfunctions and strategy functions of player 2. In connection with\nformulas in prenex form, a Skolem function for an existential\nquantifier is a function of the values assigned to the preceding\nuniversal quantifiers, but not a function of the\nvalues assigned to the preceding existential\n quantifiers.[15]\n Skolem functions are strategy functions taking as arguments\nexclusively moves made by player 1. Generally a strategy for a player\nin a two-player game can perfectly well make use of the\nprevious choices of either player. Hodges (2007) stresses that it\nmakes a difference on which notion \u2013 Skolem function or strategy\nfunction \u2013 the semantics of imperfect information is based.\nHodges (1997a) adopted the notational convention of writing, say,\n\\((\\exists y/x)\\) where Hintikka writes \\((\\exists y/\\forall x)\\),\nhence marking the difference between semantic games formulated in\nterms of arbitrary strategy functions and those whose strategy\nfunctions are in effect Skolem functions; the variable \\(x\\) in\n\\((\\exists y/x)\\) can be \u2018bound\u2019 by any syntactically\npreceding quantifier carrying the variable \\(x\\). Hodges proposed to\nemploy the former formulation, while in Hintikka (1991, 1995, 1996,\n2002) and Sandu (1993, 1994) the latter formulation is employed.\nHodges (2007: 119) writes:\n\n[W]e refer to the logic with my notation and the general game\nsemantics as slash logic. During recent years many writers in\nthis area (but never Hintikka himself) have transferred the name\n\u2018IF logic\u2019 to slash logic, often without realising the\ndifference. Until the terminology settles down, we have to beware of\nexamples and proofs that don\u2019t make clear which semantics they\nintend.\n\n\nThe distinction that Hodges makes between slash logic and IF logic\nserves to bring order to the mishmash of different formulations of IF\nfirst-order logic to be found in the\n literature.[16]\n3.1. Syntax\n\nIF first-order logic is an extension of first-order logic. Now, any\nfirst-order formula is equivalent to a first-order formula in which no\nvariable occurs both free and bound, and in which no two nested\nquantifiers carry the same variable. Formulas meeting these two\nsyntactic conditions will be termed regular. Henceforth we\nsystematically restrict attention to regular first-order\n formulas.[17]\n A vocabulary (signature, non-logical terminology) is any\ncountable set \\(\\tau\\) of relation symbols (each of which carries a\nfixed arity), function symbols (again each with a fixed arity), and\nconstant symbols. The first-order logic of vocabulary \\(\\tau\\) will be\nreferred to as \\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\). It is assumed here that among\nthe logical symbols of first-order logic there is the identity\nsymbol (=). The identity symbol is syntactically a binary\nrelation symbol, but its semantic interpretation is fixed in a way\nthat the interpretations of the items in the non-logical terminology\nare not.\n\nA formula of \\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\) is in negation normal\nform, if all occurrences of the negation symbol \\({\\sim}\\)\nimmediately precede an atomic formula. The set of formulas of\nIF first-order logic of vocabulary \\(\\tau\\) (or\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}[\\tau])\\) can be defined as the smallest set such\nthat:\n\nIf \\(\\phi\\) is a formula of \\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\) in negation\nnormal form, \\(\\phi\\) is a formula.\nIf \\(\\phi\\) is a formula and in \\(\\phi\\) a token of \\((\\exists\nx)\\) occurs in the syntactic scope of a number of universal\nquantifiers which include \\((\\forall y_1),\\ldots ,(\\forall y_n)\\), the\nresult of replacing in \\(\\phi\\) that token of \\((\\exists x)\\) by\n\\((\\exists x/\\forall y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) is a formula.\nIf \\(\\phi\\) is a formula and in \\(\\phi\\) a token of \\(\\vee\\)\noccurs in the syntactic scope of a number of universal quantifiers\nwhich include \\((\\forall y_1),\\ldots ,(\\forall y_n)\\), the result of\nreplacing in \\(\\phi\\) that token of \\(\\vee\\) by \\((\\vee /\\forall y_1\n,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) is a formula.\nIf \\(\\phi\\) is a formula and in \\(\\phi\\) a token of \\((\\forall\nx)\\) occurs in the syntactic scope of a number of existential\nquantifiers which include \\((\\exists y_1),\\ldots ,(\\exists y_n)\\), the\nresult of replacing in \\(\\phi\\) that token of \\((\\forall x)\\) by\n\\((\\forall x/\\exists y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\exists y_n)\\) is a formula.\nIf \\(\\phi\\) is a formula and in \\(\\phi\\) a token of \\(\\wedge\\)\noccurs in the syntactic scope of a number of existential quantifiers\nwhich include \\((\\exists y_1),\\ldots ,(\\exists y_n)\\), the result of\nreplacing in \\(\\phi\\) that token of \\(\\wedge\\) by \\((\\wedge /\\exists\ny_1 ,\\ldots ,\\exists y_n)\\) is a formula.\n\n\nClauses (2) and (3) allow the degenerate case that the list of\nuniversal quantifiers is empty \\((n = 0)\\). The resulting expressions\n\\((\\exists x\\)/) and \\((\\vee\\)/) are identified with the usual\nexistential quantifier \\((\\exists x)\\) and the usual disjunction\n\\(\\vee\\), respectively. Similar stipulations are made about clauses\n(4) and (5).\n\nIn a suitable vocabulary, each of the following is a formula:\n\n \\((\\forall x)(\\forall y)(\\exists z/\\forall x) R(x, y, z, v)\\),\n\n \\((\\forall x)(\\forall y)(x = y \\; (\\vee /\\forall x) \\; Q(x,\ny))\\),\n \\((\\exists x)(S(x) \\; (\\wedge /\\exists x) \\; T(x))\\), \n \\((\\forall x)(\\exists y)(\\forall z/\\exists y)(\\exists v/\\forall\nx) R(x, y, z, v)\\).\n\n\nBy contrast, none of the following sequences of symbols is a\nformula:\n\n \\((\\exists y/\\forall x) P(x, y)\\), \n \\((\\exists x)(\\exists y/\\exists x) P(x, y)\\), \n \\((\\forall x)(\\forall y/\\forall x) P(x, y)\\), \n \\((\\forall x)(S(x) \\; (\\vee /\\exists y) \\; T(x))\\). \n\n\nIf \\(\\phi\\) is an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formula, generated by the above\nclauses from some \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) formula \\(\\phi^*\\), the free\nvariables of \\(\\phi\\) are simply the free variables of\n\\(\\phi^*\\). \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formulas without free variables are\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\n sentences.[18]\n3.2. Semantics\n\nDefining the semantics of a logic using GTS is a two-step process. The\nfirst step is to define the relevant semantic games. The\nsecond step is to define the notions of \u2018true\u2019 and\n\u2018false\u2019 in terms of the semantic games; this happens by\nreference to the notion of winning strategy. Semantic games\nmay be defined by specifying recursively the alternative ways in which\na game associated with a given formula \\(\\phi\\) can be\n begun.[19]\n\nFor every vocabulary \\(\\tau\\), \\(\\mathbf{IFL}[\\tau]\\) formula\n\\(\\phi\\), model \\((\\tau\\) structure) \\(M\\), and variable assignment\n\\(g\\), a two-player zero-sum game \\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) between player 1\nand player 2 is\n associated.[20]\n If \\(g\\) is a variable assignment, \\(g[x/a]\\) is the variable\nassignment which is otherwise like \\(g\\) but maps the variable \\(x\\)\nto the object \\(a\\).\n\nIf \\(\\phi = R(t_1 ,\\ldots ,t_n)\\) and \\(M, g \\vDash R(t_1 ,\\ldots\n,t_n)\\), player 2 wins (and player 1 loses); otherwise player 1 wins\n(and player 2 loses).\nIf \\(\\phi = t_1 = t_2\\) and \\(M, g \\vDash t_1 = t_2\\), player 2\nwins (and player 1 loses); otherwise player 1 wins (and player 2\nloses).\nIf \\(\\phi = {\\sim}R(t_1 ,\\ldots ,t_n)\\) and \\(M, g \\not\\vDash\nR(t_1 ,\\ldots ,t_n)\\), player 2 wins (and player 1 loses); otherwise\nplayer 1 wins (and player 2 loses).\nIf \\(\\phi = {\\sim}t_1 = t_2\\) and \\(M, g \\not\\vDash t_1 = t_2\\),\nplayer 2 wins (and player 1 loses); otherwise player 1 wins (and\nplayer 2 loses).\nIf \\(\\phi = (\\psi \\; (\\wedge /\\exists y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\exists y_n) \\;\n\\chi)\\), player 1 chooses \\(\\theta \\in \\{\\psi ,\\chi \\}\\) and the rest\nof the game is as in \\(G(\\theta , M, g)\\).\nIf \\(\\phi = (\\psi \\; (\\vee /\\forall y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n) \\;\n\\chi)\\), player 2 chooses \\(\\theta \\in \\{\\psi ,\\chi \\}\\) and the rest\nof the game is as in \\(G(\\theta , M, g)\\).\nIf \\(\\phi = (\\forall x/\\exists y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\exists y_n)\\psi\\),\nplayer 1 chooses an element \\(a\\) from \\(\\rM\\), and the rest of the\ngame is as in \\(G(\\psi , M, g[x/a]\\)).\nIf \\(\\phi = (\\exists x/\\forall y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\psi\\),\nplayer 2 chooses an element \\(a\\) from \\(\\rM\\), and the rest of the\ngame is as in \\(G(\\psi , M, g[x/a]\\)).\n\n\nObserve that the independence indications play no role in the game\nrules. Indeed, quantifier independence will be implemented on the\nlevel of strategies. \n\nIf a token of \\((\\vee /\\forall y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) or\n\\((\\exists x/\\forall y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) appears in the\nformula \\(\\phi\\) in the scope of the universal quantifiers \\(\\forall\ny_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n,\\forall z_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall z_m\\) (and only\nthese universal quantifiers), a strategy function of player 2\nfor this token in game \\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) is any function \\(f\\)\nsatisfying the following:\n\nThe arguments of \\(f\\) are the elements \\(a_1 ,\\ldots ,a_m\\) that\nplayer 1 has chosen so as to interpret the quantifiers \\(\\forall z_1\n,\\ldots ,\\forall z_m\\). The value \\(f(a_1 ,\\ldots ,a_m)\\) is the left\nor the right disjunct when the token is a disjunction; and an element\nof the domain when the token is an existential quantifier. \n\nThe notion of the strategy function of player 1 for tokens of\n\\((\\wedge /\\exists y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\exists y_n)\\) and \\((\\forall\nx/\\exists y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\exists y_n)\\) can be defined dually. Strategy\nfunctions are construed as Skolem functions \u2013 the more general\nnotion of strategy function operative in slash logic is not considered\nhere (cf. the beginning of Sect. 3 and Subsect.\n6.1). Quantifier independence will be implemented directly in terms of\nthe arguments of the strategy functions.\n\nA strategy of player 2 in game \\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) is a set\n\\(F\\) of her strategy functions, one function for each token of\n\\((\\vee /\\forall y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) and \\((\\exists x/\\forall\ny_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) appearing in \\(\\phi\\). Player 2 is said to\nfollow the strategy \\(F\\), if for each token of \\((\\vee\n/\\forall y_1 ,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) and \\((\\exists x/\\forall y_1\n,\\ldots ,\\forall y_n)\\) for which she must make a move when game\n\\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) is played, she makes the move determined by the\ncorresponding strategy function. A winning strategy for\nplayer 2 in \\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) is a strategy \\(F\\) such that against\nany sequence of moves by player 1, following strategy \\(F\\) yields a\nwin for player 2. The notions of strategy and winning strategy can be\nsimilarly defined for player\n 1.[21]\n\nThe satisfaction and dissatisfaction of the\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formula \\(\\phi\\) in the model \\(M\\) under the\nassignment \\(g\\) are then defined as\n follows:[22]\n\n (Satisfaction) \\(\\phi\\) is satisfied in \\(M\\)\nunder \\(g\\) iff there is a winning strategy for player 2 in game\n\\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\). \n (Dissatisfaction) \\(\\phi\\) is dissatisfied in\n\\(M\\) under \\(g\\) iff there is a winning strategy for player 1 in game\n\\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\). \n\n\nAs with \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), variable assignments do not affect the\n(dis)satisfaction of sentences, i.e., formulas containing no\nfree variables. Indeed, we may\n define:[23]\n\n(Truth) \\(\\phi\\) is true in \\(M\\) iff there is a\nwinning strategy for player 2 in game \\(G(\\phi , M)\\).\n(Falsity) \\(\\phi\\) is false in \\(M\\) iff there is\na winning strategy for player 1 in game \\(G(\\phi , M)\\).\n\n\nThe fact that \\(\\phi\\) is true in \\(M\\) will be denoted by \u2018\\(M\n\\vDash \\phi\\).\u2019 Writing \\(M \\not\\vDash \\phi\\) indicates, then,\nthat \\(\\phi\\) is not true in \\(M\\). This does not mean that\n\\(\\phi\\) would in the above-defined sense be false in \\(M\\). As\nmentioned in the end of Section 2, there are semantic games\nin which neither player has a winning strategy.\n\nThe syntax of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) can be generalized by removing the\nrestriction according to which the negation sign may only appear as\nprefixed to an atomic\n formula.[24].\n In order to interpret negation in GTS, two roles are added\nas a new ingredient in the specification of the games: those of\n\u2018verifier\u2019 and \u2018falsifier.\u2019 Initially, player\n1 has the role of \u2018falsifier\u2019 and player 2 that of\n\u2018verifier.\u2019 The roles may get switched, but only for one\nreason: when an occurrence of the negation symbol is encountered. All\nclauses defining semantic games must be rephrased in terms of roles\ninstead of players. It is the player whose role is\n\u2018verifier\u2019 who makes a move for disjunctions and\nexistential quantifiers, and similarly the player whose role is\n\u2018falsifier\u2019 who moves for conjunctions and universal\nquantifiers. When a formula \\({\\sim}\\psi\\) is encountered, the players\nchange roles and the game continues with \\(\\psi\\). Finally, if the\nencountered atomic formula is true, \u2018verifier\u2019 wins and\n\u2018falsifier\u2019 loses, otherwise the payoffs are reversed. The\nnegation \\({\\sim}\\) is variably referred to as strong\nnegation, dual negation, or game-theoretical\n negation.[25]\n It works as one would expect: \\(\\phi\\) is false in \\(M\\) iff its\nnegation \\({\\sim}\\phi\\) is true therein (cf. Sandu 1993). \n3.3. Basic properties and notions\n\nFailure of bivalence. There are sentences \\(\\phi\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) and models \\(M\\) such that \\(\\phi\\) is neither true\nnor false in \\(M\\). Consider evaluating the sentence \\((\\forall\nx)(\\exists y/\\forall x) x = y\\) on a model whose domain has exactly\ntwo elements, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Player 1 has no winning strategy. If he\nchooses \\(a\\) to interpret \\(\\forall x\\), he loses the play in which\nplayer 2 chooses \\(a\\) to interpret \\((\\exists y/\\forall x)\\).\nSimilarly, if player 1 chooses \\(b\\), he loses the play in which\nplayer 2 likewise chooses \\(b\\). Neither does player 2 have a winning\nstrategy. Her strategy functions for \\((\\exists y/\\forall x)\\) are\nconstants (zero-place functions). There are two such constants\navailable: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Whichever one of these strategy functions\nplayer 2 assumes, there is a move by player 1 defeating it. If player\n2 opts for \\(a\\), player 1 wins the play in which he chooses \\(b\\);\nand if player 2 applies \\(b\\), player 1 wins the play in which he\nchooses \\(a\\). Game \\(G(\\phi , M)\\) is non-determined:\nneither player has a winning\n strategy.[26]\n The notion of non-determinacy may be extended to formulas as\nwell:\n\n(Non-determinacy) \\(\\phi\\) is non-determined in\n\\(M\\) under \\(g\\) iff there is no winning strategy for player 1, nor\nfor player 2, in game \\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\).\n\n\nIn \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), falsity does not ensue from non-truth. That is,\nbivalence fails in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). However, it should be noted that\nit does not fail due to the postulation of a third truth-value or a\ntruth-value gap (cf. Hintikka 1991: 20,\n 55).[27]\n Rather, the failure is a consequence of the basic assumptions of the\nentire semantic theory (GTS). Non-determinacy corresponds to a\nstructural property: the fact that certain kinds of functions do not\nexist on the model considered.\n\nDue to the failure of bivalence, the logical law of excluded middle\nfails for the dual negation \\({\\sim}\\). Actually, \\(\\phi\\) is\nnon-determined in \\(M\\) iff \\(M \\not\\vDash(\\phi \\vee{\\sim}\\phi)\\).\n\n\nLogical equivalence. Sentences \\(\\psi\\) and \\(\\chi\\)\nof \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) are truth equivalent if they are true in\nprecisely the same models, and falsity equivalent if they are\nfalse in precisely the same models. Sentences \\(\\psi\\) and \\(\\chi\\)\nare logically equivalent if they are both truth equivalent\nand falsity\n equivalent.[28]\n Due to the failure of bivalence, in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) truth\nequivalence does not guarantee logical equivalence. \n\nTruth, falsity, and independence indications. The\nsyntax of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) allows formulas in which both universal and\nexistential quantifiers appear slashed, e.g., \n\\[\n\\phi : (\\forall x)(\\exists y/\\forall x)(\\forall z/\\exists y) R(x, y, z).\n\\]\n\n\nOn the other hand, quantifier independence is implemented at the level\nof strategies. Consequently independence indications following a\nuniversal quantifier are vacuous, when the satisfaction of a formula\n(truth of a sentence) is considered. Similarly, independence\nindications following an existential quantifier are vacuous when the\ndissatisfaction of a formula (falsity of a sentence) is at stake. The\nsentence \\(\\phi\\) is true in the model \\(M\\) iff player 2 has a\nwinning strategy \\(F=\\{c\\}\\) in game \\(G(\\phi , M)\\). This, again,\nmeans that whichever elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) player 1 chooses to\ninterpret \\((\\forall x)\\) and \\((\\forall z/\\exists y)\\), respectively,\nthe constant interpretation \\(c\\) of \\((\\exists y/\\forall x)\\) given\nby the (zero-place) strategy function \\(c\\) satisfies \\(R(a, c, b)\\)\nin \\(M\\). But this amounts to the same as requiring that whichever\nelements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) player 1 chooses to interpret \\((\\forall x)\\)\nand \\((\\forall z)\\), respectively, the constant interpretation \\(c\\)\nof \\((\\exists y/\\forall x)\\) satisfies \\(R(a, c, b)\\) in \\(M\\).\nIndeed, \\(\\phi\\) is truth equivalent to a sentence containing no\nslashed universal quantifiers: \n\n\\(\\phi\\) is true in a model \\(M\\) iff the sentence \\((\\forall\nx)(\\exists y/\\forall x)(\\forall z) R(x, y, z)\\) is true in \\(M\\). \n\nSimilarly, \\(\\phi\\) is falsity equivalent to a sentence containing no\nslashed existential quantifiers: \\(\\phi\\) is false in a model \\(M\\)\niff the sentence \\((\\forall x)(\\exists y)(\\forall z/\\exists y) R(x, y,\nz)\\) is false therein.\n3.4. Extended IF first-order logic\n\nIf \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), \\(\\phi\\) is false in a\nmodel \\(M\\) iff \\({\\sim}\\phi\\) is true in \\(M\\) iff \\(\\phi\\) is not\ntrue in \\(M\\). By contrast, in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) falsity and non-truth\ndo not coincide. An extension of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) can be introduced,\nwhere it is possible to speak of the non-truth of sentences. To this\nend, let us introduce a new negation symbol, \\(\\neg\\), referred to as\nweak negation, contradictory negation or\nclassical\n negation.[29]\n The set of formulas of extended IF first-order logic (to be\ndenoted \\(\\mathbf{EIFL})\\) is obtained from the set of formulas of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) by closing it under the operations \\(\\neg\\),\n\\(\\wedge\\), and\n \\(\\vee\\):[30]\n\nAll formulas of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) are formulas of\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\).\nIf \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are formulas of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\), then\nso are \\(\\neg \\phi , (\\phi \\wedge \\psi)\\) and \\((\\phi \\vee\n\\psi)\\).\n\n\nSo if \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formulas,\ne.g. \\(\\neg \\phi\\) and \\((\\neg \\phi \\vee \\psi)\\) are\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) formulas; by contrast \\((\\forall x)\\neg \\phi\\) is\nnot. For the crucial restriction that \\(\\neg\\) may not occur in the\nscope of a quantifier, see Hintikka (1991: 49; 1996: 148). For\ncounterexamples to this restriction see, however, Hintikka (1996: 148;\n2002c) and especially Hintikka (2006b) in which the so-called\nfully extended IF first-order logic (FEIFL)\nis considered. In FEIFL, any occurrences of \\(\\neg\\)\nare allowed which are subject to the following syntactic condition: if\n(Q\\(x/W)\\) is a quantifier in the syntactic scope of an occurrence of\n\\(\\neg\\), then all quantifiers listed in \\(W\\) are likewise in the\nsyntactic scope of that occurrence of \\(\\neg\\).\n\nThe semantics of an \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) formula formed by contradictory\nnegation is simply this: \n\\[\nM, g \\vDash \\neg \\phi \\text{ iff } M, g \\not\\vDash \\phi.\n\\]\n\n\nFrom the viewpoint of GTS, the connective \\(\\neg\\) behaves in an\nunusual way. For all connectives of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), there is a game\nrule (which can be seen as specifying the meaning of the connective).\nFor contradictory negation there is no game rule, and its semantics is\nnot explained in terms of plays of semantic games. A formula \\(\\neg\n\\phi\\) serves to say, globally, something about an entire game\n\\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\). If \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence, to say that \\(\\neg\n\\phi\\) is true in \\(M\\) is to say that player 2 does not have\na winning strategy in game \\(G(\\phi , M)\\). If, again, there is indeed\na winning strategy for player 2 in \\(G(\\phi , M)\\), by stipulation\n\\(\\neg \\phi\\) is false in\n \\(M\\).[31]\n\nNot only is \\(\\neg \\phi\\) not itself a formula of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\),\nbut it cannot in general even be expressed in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (see\nSubsect. 4.2). The law of excluded middle holds for the\ncontradictory negation: for all sentences \\(\\phi\\) and all models\n\\(M\\), indeed \\(M \\vDash(\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi)\\). In Section 5\nit will be seen how Hintikka has proposed to make use of\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) when discussing issues in the philosophy of\nmathematics. \n4. Metalogical Properties of IF First-order Logic\n\nThe metalogical properties of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) have been discussed in\nseveral publications, by Hintikka as well as\n Sandu.[32]\n When presenting them, reference will be made to existential\nsecond-order logic\n \\((\\mathbf{ESO})\\);[33]\n further important notions are those of the skolemization and\nSkolem normal form of an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formula. For\nprecise definitions of these notions,\n the supplementary document\n can be consulted. In brief, \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) is obtained from\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) by allowing existential quantification over relation\nand function symbols in a first-order formula. The skolemization\n\\(\\mathrm{sk}[\\phi]\\) of an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formula \\(\\phi\\) is a\nfirst-order formula of a larger vocabulary. It explicates in\nterms of function symbols how existential quantifiers and disjunction\nsymbols of \\(\\phi\\) depend on preceding universal quantifiers. For\nexample, a skolemization of the \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence \\(\\phi =\n(\\forall x)(\\exists y)(\\forall z)(\\exists v/\\forall x)R(x, y, z, v)\\)\nof vocabulary \\(\\{R\\}\\) is the \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) sentence\n\\(\\mathrm{sk}[\\phi] = (\\forall x)(\\forall z)R(x, f(x), z, h(z))\\) of\nvocabulary \\(\\{R, f, h\\}\\). Its Skolem normal form, again, is the\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) sentence \\(\\mathrm{SK}[\\phi] = (\\exists f)(\\exists\nh)(\\forall x)(\\forall z)R(x, f(x), z, h(z))\\). The first-order\nsentence \\(\\mathrm{sk}[\\phi]\\) must not be confused with the\nsecond-order sentence \\(\\mathrm{SK}[\\phi]\\). \n4.1. First-order logic and existential second-order logic\n\nGame-theoretical vs. Tarskian semantics of FO. The\nset of formulas of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) is a proper subset of the set of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formulas. The standard semantics of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\)\nis not the one provided by GTS, but the Tarskian semantics specifying\nrecursively the satisfaction relation \\(M, g \\vDash \\phi\\). If the\nAxiom of Choice is\n assumed,[34]\n the two semantics of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) coincide:\n\nTheorem (assuming AC). (Hodges 1983: 94, Hintikka\n& Kulas 1985: 6\u20137) Let \\(\\tau\\) be any vocabulary, \\(M\\) any\n\\(\\tau\\) structure, \\(g\\) any variable assignment and \\(\\phi\\) any\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\) formula. Then \\(M, g \\vDash \\phi\\) holds in the\nstandard sense iff there is a winning strategy for player 2 in game\n\\(G(\\phi , M,\n g)\\).[35]\n\n\nRelation to ESO. \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) are\n intertranslatable:[36]\n\n\nTheorem (assuming AC)\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) have the same expressive power.\n\n\nThat is, (1) for every \\(\\mathbf{IFL}[\\tau]\\) formula \\(\\phi\\) there\nis an \\(\\mathbf{ESO}[\\tau]\\) formula \\(\\phi'\\) such that for all\n\\(\\tau\\) structures \\(M\\) and variable assignments \\(g\\), we have:\n\\(M, g \\vDash \\phi\\) iff \\(M, g \\vDash \\phi'\\). Actually,\n\\(\\mathrm{SK}[\\phi]\\) is a suitable \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) formula. And (2)\nfor every \\(\\mathbf{ESO}[\\tau]\\) formula \\(\\psi\\) there is an\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}[\\tau]\\) formula \\(\\psi'\\) such that \\(M, g \\vDash\n\\psi\\) iff \\(M, g \\vDash \\psi'\\), for all \\(\\tau\\) structures \\(M\\)\nand variable assignments \\(g\\). This follows from the fact that\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) can be translated into \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) (Enderton\n1970, Walkoe 1970), which again can be translated into\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\).\n\nHintikka suggests that \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) is, substantially speaking, a\nfirst-order logic: the entities its quantified variables\nrange over are individuals, and so are all entities with\nwhich the players of the semantic games operate. (See\nSubsect. 5.1 for a discussion of this idea.) A part of the\ninterest of the intertranslatability theorem lies in the fact that if\nHintikka\u2019s controversial claim is accepted, this would mean that\nthe expressive power of \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) can actually be achieved on\nthe first-order level.\n\nIFL is more expressive than FO. The following are\nexamples of properties expressible in \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) \u2013 and\ntherefore in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) \u2013 but not in \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\):\nDedekind-infinity of the domain, non-completeness of a linear order,\nill-foundedness of a binary relation, disconnectedness of a graph,\nequicardinality of the extensions of two first-order formulas\n\\(\\phi(x)\\) and \\(\\psi(x)\\), infinity of the extension of a\nfirst-order formula \\(\\phi(x)\\), and the topological notion of open\nset (see, e.g., Hintikka 1996, V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007).\n\n\nAs an example, the Dedekind-infinity of the domain may be considered.\nA set \\(S\\) is Dedekind-infinite precisely when there exists an\ninjective function from \\(S\\) to its proper subset. Let \\(\\phi_{inf}\\)\nbe the following sentence of\n \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\):[37]\n \n\\[\n(\\exists t)(\\forall x)(\\exists z)(\\forall y)(\\exists v/\\forall x)((x = y \\leftrightarrow z = v) \\wedge z \\ne t).\n\\]\n\n\nThe Skolem normal form of \\(\\phi_{inf}\\) is  \n\\[\n(\\exists f)(\\exists g)(\\exists t)(\\forall x)(\\forall y)((x = y\n\\leftrightarrow f(x) = g(y)) \\wedge f(x) \\ne t).\n\\]\n\n\nRelative to a model \\(M\\), this \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) sentence asserts the\nexistence of functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) and an element \\(t\\) such that\n\\(f = g\\) (implication from left to right), this function is injective\n(implication from right to left), and its domain is the whole domain\nof \\(M\\) but the element \\(t\\) does not appear in its range.\nConsequently the range is a proper subset of the domain of \\(M\\). In\nother words, the sentence \\(\\phi_{inf}\\) is true in a model \\(M\\) iff\nthe domain of \\(M\\) is infinite.\n\nBe it still noted that when attention is restricted to finite\nmodels, Ronald Fagin\u2019s famous theorem (1974) connects\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) and the complexity class \\(\\mathbf{NP}\\): a\ncomputational problem is solvable by an algorithm running in\nnon-deterministic polynomial time iff it is definable in\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) relative to the class of all finite structures. The\nfollowing are \\(\\mathbf{NP}\\)-complete properties and hence\nexpressible in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), over the class of all finite models:\nevenness of the domain, oddness of the domain, 3-colorability of a\ngraph, and the existence of a Hamiltonian path on a\n graph.[38]\n\n\nProperties in common with FO. IF first-order logic\nshares many metalogical properties with first-order\n logic.[39]\n\nCompactness. A set of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentences has\na model iff all its finite subsets have a model. \n\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem property. Suppose \\(\\phi\\) is\nan \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence that has an infinite model, or\narbitrarily large finite models. Then \\(\\phi\\) has models of all\ninfinite cardinalities. \n\nThe separation theorem holds in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) in a strengthened\nform; the \u2018separation sentence\u2019 \\(\\theta\\) is in\nparticular a sentence of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). \n\nSeparation theorem. Suppose \\(\\phi\\) is an\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence of vocabulary \\(\\tau\\), and \\(\\psi\\) an\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence of vocabulary \\(\\tau'\\). Suppose further\nthat \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) have no models in common. Then there is a\nfirst-order sentence \\(\\theta\\) of vocabulary \\(\\tau \\cap\n\\tau'\\) such that every model of \\(\\phi\\) is a model of \\(\\theta\\),\nbut \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\psi\\) have no models in common. \n\nIt is well known that for \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) there is a sound and\ncomplete proof procedure. Because a first-order sentence \\(\\phi\\) is\ninconsistent (non-satisfiable) iff its negation \\({\\sim}\\phi\\) is\nvalid (true in all models), trivially \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) also has a sound\nand complete disproof\n procedure.[40]\n The latter property extends to \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (while the former\ndoes not, see Subsect. 4.3):\n\nExistence of a complete disproof procedure. (Hintikka\n1996: 68\u201370, 82) The set of inconsistent \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\nsentences is recursively enumerable. \n4.2. Intricacies of negation\n\nIn Subsection 3.4, the contradictory negation \\(\\neg\\) was\ndistinguished from the strong negation \\({\\sim}\\). In \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\)\nthe two coincide: for any first-order sentence \\(\\phi\\), we have \\(M\n\\vDash{\\sim}\\phi\\) iff \\(M \\vDash \\neg \\phi\\). \n\nStrong negation fails as a semantic operation. Let us\nwrite \\([\\phi]\\) for the set of models of sentence \\(\\phi\\). In the\nspecial case of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), the strong negation \\({\\sim}\\)\nclearly defines a semantic operation: whenever \\(\\chi\\) and \\(\\theta\\)\nare sentences such that \\([\\chi] = [\\theta]\\), we have \\([{\\sim}\\chi]\n= [{\\sim}\\theta]\\). Burgess (2003) observed that in the context of IF\nlogic this property is lost in a very strong sense. In fact there are\nIF sentences \\(\\chi\\) and \\(\\theta\\) such that while \\([\\chi] =\n[\\theta]\\), the sets \\([{\\sim}\\chi]\\) and \\([{\\sim}\\theta]\\) are not\nonly distinct but even disjoint. \n\nInexpressibility of contradictory negation. In\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) the strong negation \\({\\sim}\\) and the contradictory\nnegation \\(\\neg\\) do not coincide: we may have \\(M \\vDash\n\\neg \\phi\\) without having \\(M \\vDash{\\sim}\\phi\\). This fact by itself\nstill leaves open the possibility that the contradictory negation of\nevery sentence \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) could be defined in\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), i.e., that there was a sentence\n\\(neg(\\phi)\\) of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) such that \\(M \\vDash\\) \\(neg(\\phi)\\)\niff \\(M \\not\\vDash \\phi\\), for all models \\(M\\). All we know by the\nfailure of the law of excluded middle is that not in all cases can\n\\(neg(\\phi)\\) be chosen to be \\({\\sim}\\phi\\). However, as a matter of\nfact contradictory negation is inexpressible in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\).\nThere are sentences \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) such that \\(\\neg\n\\phi\\) (which is a sentence of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL})\\) is not truth\nequivalent to any sentence of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). This follows from the\nwell-known fact that \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) is not closed under negation and\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) has the same expressive power as\n \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\).[41]\n\nStrong inexpressibility of contradictory negation. As\na corollary to the separation theorem, the result holds in a much\nstronger form. If \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are sentences of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) such that \\(M \\vDash \\phi\\) iff \\(M \\not\\vDash\n\\psi\\), then each of \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) is truth equivalent to a\nsentence of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). Hence the contradictory negation \\(\\neg\n\\phi\\) is only expressible in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) for those\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentences \\(\\phi\\) that are truth equivalent to an\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\)\n sentence.[42]\n\nDetermined fragment. Let us say that an\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence \\(\\phi\\) is determined if it\nsatisfies: \\(M \\vDash(\\phi \\vee{\\sim}\\phi)\\), for all models \\(M\\).\nThe determined fragment of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) is the set of\ndetermined \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentences. In the determined fragment\ncontradictory negation is syntactically expressible by the\nstrong negation. By the strong inexpressibility of contradictory\nnegation, the determined fragment of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) has the same\nexpressive power as \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). Membership in the determined\nfragment is a sufficient but not necessary condition for an\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence to have its contradictory negation\nexpressible in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). The sentence \\((\\forall y)(\\exists\nx/\\forall y) x = y\\) is not\n determined;[43]\n yet its contradictory negation \\((\\forall x)(\\exists y) x \\ne y\\) is\nexpressible in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\).\n\nContradictory negation and GTS. The truth-conditions\nthat GTS yields are of the form \u2018there are strategy functions\n\\(f_1 ,\\ldots ,f_n\\) such that \u2014,\u2019 i.e., it gives\nrise to truth-conditions expressible in \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\). By the\nstrong inexpressibility of contradictory negation, there is no single\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence, not translatable into \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\),\nwhose contradictory negation has a truth-condition of that form. This\nfact makes it understandable why contradictory negation should not be\nexpected to admit of a game-theoretical interpretation along the same\nlines in which the other logical operators are interpreted. Different\nways of assigning a game-theoretical interpretation to contradictory\nnegation can, however, be developed. To this end, in the context of\nfully extended IF first-order logic (FEIFL,\ncf. Subsect. 3.4), Hintikka has proposed to use semantic games with\nsubgames. (See Hintikka 2002c, 2006b; for subgames, see\nCarlson & Hintikka 1979, Hintikka & Kulas 1983.) This approach\nleads to mixing the play level with the strategy level: choices of\nindividuals made in a subgame may depend on strategy functions chosen\nin earlier subgames. In Tulenheimo (2014), a game-theoretical\nsemantics is formulated for the fragment of FEIFL\nthat consists of formulas in prenex form. Plays of the correlated\ngames do not involve choosing any second-order objects, such as\nstrategy functions. Contradictory negation \\((\\neg)\\) is interpreted\nby introducing an additional component in game positions: a\nmode. At the play level, the negation \\(\\neg\\) triggers not\nonly a role switch (like the dual negation \\({\\sim})\\), but it also\ninvolves changing the mode from positive to negative or vice versa.\nThe semantic effect of modes becomes visible at the strategy level:\nmodes regulate the way in which the truth condition of a sentence\ninvolves existentially or universally quantifying over strategy\nfunctions. Like independence indications, also occurrences of \\(\\neg\\)\nare, then, interpreted in terms of conditions that act on the strategy\nlevel. For related research, see Figueira et al. (2011,\n2014).\n\nContradictory negation and finite models. Certain\nmajor open questions in logic and theoretical computer science can be\nformulated in terms of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). It is an open question in\ncomplexity theory whether \\(\\mathbf{NP} = \\mathbf{coNP}\\), that is,\nwhether the class of \\(\\mathbf{NP}\\)-solvable problems is the same as\nthe class of problems whose complement is solvable in \\(\\mathbf{NP}\\).\nBy Fagin\u2019s theorem (1974), this open problem can be equivalently\nformulated as follows: Is \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) closed under negation\nover finite models? That is, is there for every IF sentence\n\\(\\phi\\) another IF sentence \\(neg(\\phi)\\) such that for any finite\nmodel \\(M\\), \\(neg(\\phi)\\) is true in \\(M\\) iff \\(\\phi\\) is not true\nin \\(M\\)? Proving that the answer is negative would settle the\nnotorious \\(\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{NP}\\) problem, i.e., establish that\nthere are computational problems for which one can efficiently\nverify whether a proposed solution is correct although one\ncannot efficiently find a\n solution.[44]\n4.3 Failure of axiomatizability\n\nAs is well known, \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) admits of a sound and complete proof\nprocedure: there is a mechanical way of generating precisely those\nfirst-order sentences that are valid (true in all models). This fact\ncan also be expressed by saying that \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) is axiomatizable,\nor that the set of valid sentences of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) is recursively\n enumerable.[45]\n Due to its greater expressive power, axiomatizability fails\nfor \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). In other words, \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) is semantically\n incomplete.[46]\n\nOne way to show this is as follows. Suppose for the sake of\ncontradiction that the set of valid \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentences is\nrecursively enumerable. Recall that the sentence \\(\\phi_{inf}\\)\ndiscussed in Subsection 4.1 is true in all and only infinite\nmodels. Note, then, that an \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) sentence \\(\\chi\\) is true\nin all finite models iff the \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence\n\\((\\phi_{inf} \\vee \\chi)\\) is valid. Given a valid \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\nsentence, it can be effectively checked whether the sentence is\nsyntactically of the form \\((\\phi_{inf} \\vee \\chi)\\), where \\(\\chi\\)\nis a first-order sentence. Hence the recursive enumeration of all\nvalid \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentences yields a recursive enumeration of\nfirst-order sentences \\(\\chi\\) true in all finite models. But this\ncontradicts Trakhtenbrot\u2019s theorem, according to which the set\nof \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) sentences true in all finite models is not\nrecursively\n enumerable.[47]\n\nWhat is the relevance of the failure of axiomatizability of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)? Discussing finite partially ordered quantifiers,\nQuine (1970: 89\u201391) suggests that we should refuse to give the\nstatus of logic to any generalization of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) which does\nnot have a sound and complete proof procedure both for\nvalidity and for inconsistency. For Quine, any such\ngeneralization belongs to mathematics rather than logic. Since\n\\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) is not axiomatizable, it falls outside the realm of\nlogic, thus\n delineated.[48]\n\nHintikka finds this type of allegation unfounded. First,\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) shares many of the important metalogical results with\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) (cf. Subsect. 4.1). Second, just like\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), also \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) can be translated into\nsecond-order logic. The only difference is that in the former case a\nlarger variety of quantifier (in)dependencies must be encoded by\nSkolem functions than in the latter. Why would the former translation\nrender \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) a part of mathematics while the latter would\nallow \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) to remain a logic (Hintikka 1991: 26\u201327)?\nThird, one must make a distinction between what is needed to\nunderstand an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence, and what is needed to\nmechanically deal with the validities (logical truths) of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). Due to its non-axiomatizability, there are no\nmechanical rules for generating the set of all validities of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). However, to understand a sentence is to know what\nthings are like when it is true, not to know what things are\nlike when it is logically true (Hintikka 1995: 13\u201314).\nFourth, because of non-axiomatizability, the valid inference patterns\nin \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) cannot be exhausted by any recursive enumeration.\nInsofar as important mathematical problems can be reduced to questions\nabout the validity of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) formulas (Subsect.\n5.3), progress in mathematics can be seen to consist (not of the\ndiscovery of stronger set-theoretical axioms but) of ever more\npowerful rules for establishing validity in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (Hintikka\n1996: 100; 2000: 135\u2013136).\n4.4 Compositionality and the failure of Tarski-type semantics\n\nThe principle of compositionality (a.k.a. Frege principle) states that\nsemantic attributes of a complex expression \\(E\\) are determined by\nthe semantic attributes of its constituent expressions and the\nstructure of \\(E\\). In particular, the semantic attribute of interest\n(e.g., truth) may be determined in terms of one or more\nauxiliary semantic attributes (e.g.,\n satisfaction).[49]\n Hintikka has argued that compositionality amounts to semantic\ncontext-independence: semantic attributes of a complex expression\ndepend only on the semantic attributes of its constituent\nexpressions, plus its structure \u2013 they do not depend on\nthe sentential context in which the expression is embedded. Semantic\ncontext-independence makes it possible to carry out semantic analysis\nfrom inside out \u2013 from simpler expressions to more\ncomplex\n ones.[50]\n This is what is needed for recursive definitions of semantic\nattributes \u2013 such as Tarski-type definitions of truth and\nsatisfiability \u2013 to be\n possible.[51]\n By contrast, the GTS analysis of sentences is an outside in\nprocess: a semantic game starts with an entire sentence, and stepwise\nanalyzes the sentence into simpler and simpler components, eventually\nreaching an atomic formula (together with an appropriate variable\nassignment). Therefore GTS allows accounting for semantic\ncontext-dependencies that violate the principle of\n compositionality.[52]\n\nIn \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) an existential quantifier may depend only on\nsome of the universal quantifiers in whose scope it lies.\nAccordingly, its interpretation depends on its relation to quantifiers\noutside its own scope. Such an existential quantifier is\n context-dependent.[53]\n On the face of it, then, \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) cannot but violate the\nprinciple of compositionality and does not admit of a Tarski-type\ntruth-definition. \n\nHodges (1997a,b) showed, however, that \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) can be given a\ncompositional\n semantics.[54]\n The semantics is given by recursively defining the satisfaction\nrelation \u2018\\(M \\vDash_X \\phi\\)\u2019 (read: \\(\\phi\\) is\nsatisfied in \\(M\\) by \\(X)\\), where \\(X\\) is a set of\nvariable assignments. While the Tarskian semantics for \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\)\nis in terms of single variable assignments, Hodges\u2019s semantics\nemploys sets of variable assignments. The game-theoretical semantics\nof \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) is captured by this compositional semantics: for\nevery formula \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), player 2 has a winning\nstrategy in \\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) iff the condition \\(M \\vDash_{\\{g\\}}\n\\phi\\) holds. Due to Hodges\u2019s semantic clauses for existential\nquantifiers and disjunctions involving independence indications, the\nevaluation of \\(\\phi\\) relative to the singleton set \\(\\{g\\}\\)\ngenerally leads to evaluating syntactic components of \\(\\phi\\)\nrelative to sets of (possibly infinitely) many variable assignments.\nHintikka remarks (2006a: 65) that if one is sufficiently ruthless, one\ncan always save compositionality by building the laws of semantic\ninteraction of different expressions into the respective meanings of\nthose\n expressions.[55]\n\nIt is methodologically worth pointing out that compositionality is not\nneeded for defining \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). The very existence of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) proves that rejecting compositionality is no obstacle\nfor the formulation of a powerful logic (Hintikka 1995). It should\nalso be noted that what makes Hodges\u2019s result work is its\ntype-theoretical ascent. Let us say that a Tarski-type\ncompositional semantics is a compositional semantics which interprets\neach formula \\(\\phi(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) of \\(n\\) free variables in\nterms of an \\(n\\)-tuple of elements of the domain. Hence the standard\nsemantics of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) is Tarski-type, but Hodges\u2019s\nsemantics employing the satisfaction relation \u2018\\(M \\vDash_X\n\\phi\\)\u2019 is not, because the latter evaluates a formula\n\\(\\phi(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) of \\(n\\) free variables relative to an\nentire set of \\(n\\)-tuples of elements. Cameron & Hodges\n(2001) proved that actually there is \\(no\\) Tarski-type compositional\nsemantics for \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). \n\nThe notion of compositionality can be refined by imposing constraints\non the auxiliary semantic attributes. Sandu and Hintikka (2001: 60)\nsuggested, by analogy with \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), that \u2018satisfaction\nby a single variable assignment\u2019 would be a natural auxiliary\nattribute in connection with \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). By the result of\nCameron and Hodges, no semantics for \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) exists that\nwould be compositional in this restricted sense.\n4.5 Defining truth\n\nThe definability of truth can only be discussed in connection with\nlanguages capable of speaking of themselves. Let us consider an\narithmetical vocabulary \\(\\tau\\) and restrict attention to the\nstandard model \\(N\\) of Peano\u2019s axioms. Each sentence \\(\\phi\\)\nof vocabulary \\(\\tau\\) can then be represented by a natural number\n\\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\), its G\u00f6del number. It is assumed\nthat \\(\\tau\\) contains a numeral \\(\\boldsymbol{{}^\\ulcorner \\phi\n{}^\\urcorner}\\) for each number \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\). If \\(L\\)\nand \\(L'\\) are abstract logics of vocabulary \\(\\tau\\), such as\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), and \\(\\TRUE(x)\\) is a formula of\n\\(L'\\) such that every sentence \\(\\phi\\) of \\(L\\) satisfies: \n\n\\[\nN \\vDash \\phi \\text{ iff } N \\vDash \\TRUE(\\boldsymbol{{}^\\ulcorner \\phi {}^\\urcorner}),\n\\]\n\n\nthen \\(\\TRUE(x)\\) is said to be a truth-predicate\n(explicit truth-definition) of logic \\(L\\)\nin logic \\(L'\\) for the model \\(N\\). By Alfred Tarski\u2019s famous\ntheorem of the undefinability of truth (Tarski 1933), there\nis no truth-predicate for \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) in \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) itself\nfor the model \\(N\\). More generally, Tarski showed that under certain\nassumptions, a truth-definition for a logic \\(L\\) can only be given in\na metalanguage which is essentially stronger than \\(L\\). One of the\nassumptions is that the negation used behaves like contradictory\nnegation. On the other hand, Tarski also pointed out that an implicit\ntruth-definition for \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) in \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) itself\nis possible. Let \\(\\tau\\) be an arithmetical vocabulary, and\nlet us stay with the standard model \\(N\\) of Peano\u2019s axioms. Let\n\u2018\\(\\TRUE\\)\u2019 be a unary predicate not appearing in\n\\(\\tau\\). An \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) formula \\(\\psi(x)\\) of vocabulary \\(\\tau\n\\cup \\{\\TRUE\\}\\) is an implicit truth-definition for\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\) in \\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau \\cup \\{\\TRUE\\}]\\) for\n\\(N\\), if for every \\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\) sentence \\(\\phi\\), the\nfollowing holds: \n\n\\(N \\vDash \\phi\\) iff there is an interpretation \\(\\TRUE^N\\) of the\nunary predicate \\(\\TRUE\\) such that \\((N, \\TRUE^N ) \\vDash\n\\psi(\\boldsymbol{{}^\\ulcorner \\phi\n {}^\\urcorner})\\).[56]\n\n\nIntuitively, \\(\\TRUE^N\\) is the set of those natural numbers that are\nG\u00f6del numbers of true arithmetic sentences of vocabulary\n\\(\\tau\\); and \\(\\psi(x)\\) says that \\(x\\) is a G\u00f6del number in\nthe extension of the predicate \\(\\TRUE\\). The formula \\(\\psi(x)\\) is a\nconjunction including clauses that mimic, on the object-language\nlevel, the metalogical recursive clauses of the Tarski-type\ntruth-definition for \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). E.g., one of the\nconjuncts is \n\\[\\begin{align*} \n(\\forall y)(\\forall z)(y = \\boldsymbol{{}^\\ulcorner \\chi {}^\\urcorner}\n &\\wedge z = \\boldsymbol{{}^\\ulcorner \\theta {}^\\urcorner} \\wedge \n  x = \\boldsymbol{{}^\\ulcorner (\\chi \\wedge \\theta) {}^\\urcorner} \\rightarrow \\\\\n &[\\TRUE(x) \\leftrightarrow (\\TRUE(y) \\wedge \\TRUE(z))]).\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nThe implicit nature of the truth-definition is seen from the fact that\nthe predicate \\(\\TRUE\\) appears on both sides of the equivalence sign\nin these\n clauses.[57]\n The above implicit truth-definition of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) for \\(N\\) is\nof the form \u2018there is a set \\(S\\) interpreting the predicate\n\\(\\TRUE\\) such that \\(\\psi(x)\\).\u2019 Thus the implicit\ntruth-definition of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) in \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) gives rise to\nthe explicit truth-definition \\(\\exists \\TRUE\\, \\psi(x)\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}[\\tau]\\) in \\(\\mathbf{ESO}[\\tau]\\) for \\(N\\). Since\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) have the same expressive power,\na truth-predicate of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) for \\(N\\) can be formulated in\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). \n\nThe same reasoning can be applied to \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) itself, and\nthereby to \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (Hintikka 1991, 1996; Hyttinen & Sandu\n2000; Sandu 1996, 1998). Namely, an \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) formula\n\\(\\chi(x)\\) of vocabulary \\(\\tau \\cup \\{\\TRUE\\}\\) can be formulated\nwhich is an implicit truth-definition of\n\\(\\mathbf{ESO}[\\tau]\\) for \\(N\\). Therefore the \\(\\mathbf{ESO}[\\tau]\\)\nformula \\(\\exists \\TRUE\\, \\chi(x)\\) is an explicit\ntruth-definition of \\(\\mathbf{ESO}[\\tau]\\) for \\(N\\). Here the\ntruth-predicate is formulated in the very same language whose notion\nof truth is being defined: \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\). Hence \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\),\nand thereby \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), is capable of explicitly defining its\nown truth-predicate relative to\n \\(N\\).[58]\n This result does not contradict Tarski\u2019s undefinability result,\nbecause here non-determined sentences are possible; the negation used\nis not contradictory\n negation.[59]\n\nTarski (1983) adopted a view according to which truth cannot be defined\nfor natural languages. It has been argued in Hintikka & Sandu\n(1999) that this was due to Tarski\u2019s belief that\ncompositionality fails in natural\n languages.[60]\n \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) does not have a Tarski-type compositional semantics,\nbut it admits of formulating a self-applied truth-predicate. The\nproposed reason why Tarski believed it not to be possible to discuss\nthe notion of truth in natural languages themselves cannot, then, be\nentertained from the viewpoint of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). For, the case of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) shows that the failure of Tarski-type\ncompositionality for a language does not entail the impossibility for\nthe language to define its own\n truth-predicate.[61]\n\n4.6 Properties of extended IF first-order logic\n\nExpressive power. Since \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) is not\nclosed under contradictory negation, \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) is strictly\nmore expressive than \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (cf. Subsect.\n 4.2).[62]\n The following properties are expressible in \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) but not\nin \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (Hintikka 1996: 188\u2013190): finiteness of the\ndomain, well-foundedness of a binary relation, connectedness of a\ngraph, principle of mathematical induction, Bolzano-Weierstrass\ntheorem, and the topological notion of continuity.\n\nMetalogical properties. The nice metatheorems that\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) shares with \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) are lost: Compactness,\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem property, separation theorem, and the existence\nof a complete disproof procedure all fail for \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\)\n(Hintikka 1991: 49, 1996: 189). No self-applied truth-predictate is\npossible for \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\). The definition of such a\ntruth-predicate would have to contain the clause \n\\[\\begin{align*}\n(\\forall y)(y = \\boldsymbol{{}^\\ulcorner \\theta {}^\\urcorner} &\\wedge \n x = \\boldsymbol{{}^\\ulcorner \\neg \\theta {}^\\urcorner} \\rightarrow \\\\\n &[\\TRUE(x) \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\TRUE(y)]).\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nBut this clause is not a well-formed formula of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\),\nsince \\(\\neg\\) appears in the scope of the universal quantifier\n\\((\\forall y)\\) (cf. Hintikka 1996: 151).\n\nThe validity and satisfiability problems of the full second-order can\nbe effectively reduced to the corresponding problems concerning\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\). Namely, why cannot a second-order sentence simply\nbe thought of as a two-sorted first-order sentence? Because in order\nto capture the standard interpretation of second-order\n logic,[63]\n it must be said that for every extensionally possible set of\n\\(n\\)-tuples of elements of sort 1 there exists a member of sort 2\nhaving those and only those elements as members, for all arities \\(n\\)\nsuch that the second-order sentence contains a quantifier \\((\\exists\nR)\\) where \\(R\\) is\n \\(n\\)-ary.[64]\n Now, such additional conditions can be expressed by a finite\nconjunction \\(X\\) of \\(\\mathbf{USO}\\) sentences, where\n\\(\\mathbf{USO}\\) (universal second-order logic) is obtained\nfrom \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) by allowing universal quantification over\nrelation and function symbols in a first-order formula. Each of these\n\\(\\mathbf{USO}\\) sentences can be expressed as the contradictory\nnegation of an \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) sentence and therefore as the\ncontradictory negation of an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence. Consequently,\nthere is an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence \\(Y\\) such that \\(X\\) itself is\nlogically equivalent to \\(\\neg Y\\). And here \\(\\neg Y\\) is a sentence\nof \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\). Therefore, if \\(\\phi\\) is a second-order\nsentence and \\(\\phi^*\\) its reconstruction in two-sorted first-order\nlogic, we have: \\(\\phi\\) is satisfiable iff \\((X \\wedge \\phi^*)\\) is\nsatisfiable iff \\((\\neg Y \\wedge \\phi^*)\\) is satisfiable. And:\n\\(\\phi\\) is valid iff \\(\\phi^*\\) is a logical consequence of \\(X\\) iff\n\\((\\neg X \\vee \\phi^*)\\) is valid iff \\((Y \\vee \\phi^*)\\) is valid.\nHere, both \\((\\neg Y \\wedge \\phi^*)\\) and \\((Y \\vee \\phi^*)\\) are\nsentences of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\), the latter even a sentence of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). It follows that the satisfiability (validity) of any\nsecond-order sentence can be expressed as the satisfiability\n(respectively, validity) of a sentence of\n \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\).[65]\n\nAlgebraic structure. The two negations available in\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}, \\neg\\) and \\({\\sim}\\), agree on true sentences, as\nwell as on false ones: if \\(\\phi\\) is true (false) in \\(M\\), then both\n\\({\\sim}\\phi\\) and \\(\\neg \\phi\\) are false (true) in \\(M\\). By\ncontrast, if \\(\\phi\\) is non-determined in \\(M\\), then \\({\\sim}\\phi\\)\nis non-determined as well, but \\(\\neg \\phi\\) is true. The combination\n\\(\\neg{\\sim}\\) of the two negations applied to a sentence \\(\\phi\\)\nasserts that \\(\\phi\\) is not\n false.[66]\n\nThe propositional part of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) involves the four\noperators \\(\\neg , {\\sim}, \\wedge\\), and \\(\\vee\\). Hintikka (2004b)\nraises the question of the algebraic structure induced by these\noperators, when any two truth equivalent sentences are identified. The\noperators \\(\\neg , \\wedge\\), and \\(\\vee\\) give rise to a Boolean\nalgebra \u2013 but what does the strong negation \\({\\sim}\\) add to\nthis structure? \n\nRestricting attention to truth equivalence, \\({\\sim}\\) is definable\nfrom the operators \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\neg{\\sim}\\). For, \\({\\sim}\\phi\\) is\ntrue in \\(M\\) iff \\(\\neg(\\neg{\\sim}\\phi)\\) is true in \\(M\\). Instead\nof \\({\\sim}\\), the operator \\(\\neg{\\sim}\\) may then be considered.\nHintikka points out that the propositional part of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\)\n(formulated in terms of the operators \\(\\vee , \\wedge , \\neg\\) and\n\\(\\neg{\\sim})\\) is a Boolean algebra with an operator in the sense of\nJ\u00f3nsson & Tarski (1951). The additional operator\n\\(\\neg{\\sim}\\) is a closure operator. \n\nJ\u00f3nsson and Tarski (1951, Thm. 3.14) showed that any closure\nalgebra is isomorphic to an algebraic system formed by a set equipped\nwith a reflexive and transitive\n relation.[67]\n As a matter of fact, the relevant algebraic structure is precisely\nthat of the propositional modal logic \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\). Hence the\npropositional part of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) has the same algebraic\nstructure as \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\). By a well-known result due to G\u00f6del\n(1933) and McKinsey & Tarski (1948), intuitionistic propositional\nlogic can be interpreted in \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\), via a translation \\(t\\)\nsuch that \\(\\phi\\) is intuitionistically provable iff \\(t(\\phi)\\) is a\nvalid \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\) formula. Thus, intuitionistic propositional\nlogic is interpretable in\n \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\).[68]\n5. Philosophical Consequences\n\nHintikka (2006a: 73\u201377) takes the following to be among\nconsequences of the novel insights made possible by (extended) IF\nfirst-order logic: reconstruction of normal mathematical reasoning on\nthe first-order level, a novel perspective on the notion of truth in\naxiomatic set theory, insights into the nature of negation, and the\nformulation of a self-applied truth-predicate. A related topic of\ngeneral interest is the phenomenon of informational independence in\nnatural languages. The ideas related to negation and definability of\ntruth have been discussed in Subsections 4.2 and 4.5,\nrespectively. Let us consider here the remaining issues.\n5.1 Place in type hierarchy\n\nHintikka maintains that the only reasonable way of making a\ndistinction between first-order logic and higher-order logic is by\nreference to the entities that one\u2019s quantified variables range\nover. A first-order logic is, then, a logic in which all quantifiers\nrange over individuals, in contrast to higher-order entities\n(e.g., subsets of the domain). On this basis Hintikka holds\nthat substantially speaking, \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) and even\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) are first-order\n logics.[69]\n Solomon Feferman (2006: 457\u2013461) criticizes the criterion that\nHintikka employs for judging the first-order status of a logic.\nFeferman makes use of generalized quantifiers in his\n argument.[70]\n The formulas  \n\\[\nQ[z_1] \\ldots [z_k] (\\phi_1 ,\\ldots ,\\phi_k)\n\\]\n\n\ninvolving generalized quantifiers are syntactically\nfirst-order, insofar as the quantified variables \\(z_{i1},\\ldots\n,z_{in_i} = [z_i]\\) are first-order \\((1 \\le i \\le k)\\). The semantics\nof a generalized quantifier \\(Q\\) is formulated by associating with\neach domain M a \\(k\\)-ary relation \\(Q_M\\) on M, with \\(Q_M\n\\subseteq\\) M\\(^{n_1} \\times \\ldots \\times\\) M\\(^{n_k}\\).\nE.g., for any infinite cardinal \\(\\kappa\\), there is a\ngeneralized quantifier \\(Q_{\\ge \\kappa}\\) such that \\(Q_{\\ge \\kappa}z\nP(z)\\) is true in a model \\(M\\) iff there are at least \\(\\kappa\\)\nelements that satisfy the predicate \\(P\\). Hence generalized\nquantifiers can be semantically higher-order. (The notion of\ncardinality is a higher-order notion.) The fact that the variables in\na formula range over individuals only, does not offer a reliable\ncriterion for the logic\u2019s first-order status. \n\nHintikka\u2019s criterion could be reformulated by saying that a\nlogic is of first order, if any play of a semantic game\nassociated with a formula of this logic only involves (in addition to\nchoices interpreting conjunctions and disjunctions) choices of\nindividuals, as opposed to choices of higher-order entities. By this\ncriterion \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) (and even \\(\\mathbf{EIFL})\\) are\nfirst-order logics, but the logic of generalized quantifiers such as\n\\(Q_{\\ge \\kappa}\\) is\n not.[71]\n Feferman (2006: 461) anticipates the possibility of such a reply, but\nfinds it unconvincing.\n\nBy a result of Hintikka (1955), the problem of deciding whether a\nsentence of second-order logic is valid can be effectively reduced to\nthe validity problem of\n \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\).[72]\n V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (2001) has shown that the set of valid\nsentences of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) has the same very high complexity as the\nset of validities of the full second-order\n logic.[73]\n V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (2001) and Feferman (2006) conclude that\nspeaking of validity in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) leads to a strong commitment\nto full second-order logic. Hintikka (2006a: 476\u2013477) looks at\nthese results from the opposite direction: for him they mean that\nindeed one can speak of validity in full second-order logic in terms\nof validity in \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). What is more, Hintikka (1997) affirms\nthat even \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) is a first-order logic. If so, any\nmathematical theory that can be expressed by the truth of an\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) sentence is likewise free from problems of set\nexistence. \n\nHintikka\u2019s position leads to a puzzle. If \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence\nof \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) not truth equivalent to any \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\)\nsentence, the truth-condition of the sentence \\(\\neg \\phi\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) cannot be formulated without recourse to the set of\nall strategies of player 2: \\(\\neg \\phi\\) is true in model \\(M\\) iff\nfor all strategies of player 2 in game \\(G(\\phi , M)\\), there\nis a sequence of moves by player 1 such that player 1 wins the\nresulting play. The set of all strategies of player 2 is undeniably a\nhigher-order entity. How can commitment to entities other than\nindividuals be said to have been avoided here? Can the meaning of the\nsentence \\(\\neg \\phi\\) be well understood without presupposing the\ngenuinely second-order idea of all strategies of a given\n player?[74]\n Rather than being nominalistic, Hintikka\u2019s position appears to\nbe a variant of universalia in rebus. While rules of semantic\ngames pertain to actions performed on first-order objects,\ncombinatorial properties of sets of plays can only be formulated in\nsecond-order terms. As soon as game rules are defined for a language\nfragment, also the corresponding combinatorial properties are fully\ndetermined, among them the properties labeled as truth and\nfalsity.\n5.2 Philosophy of set theory\n\nAccording to Hintikka, our pretheoretical idea of the truth of a\nquantified sentence \\(\\phi\\) (in negation normal form) is that there\nexist \u2018witness individuals\u2019 for the existential\nquantifiers, usually depending on values corresponding to the\npreceding universal\n quantifiers.[75]\n It is the existence of such witnesses that constitutes the truth of\n\\(\\phi\\). Providing witnesses is precisely what Skolem functions for\n\\(\\phi\\)\n do.[76]\n The truth of a quantified sentence \\(\\phi\\) amounts to the existence\nof a full set of Skolem functions for \\(\\phi\\). In Hintikka\u2019s\nview, then, our ordinary notion of first-order truth is conceptualized\nin terms of (existential) second-order logic. What happens when this\nidea is applied to axiomatic set theory, say Zermelo-Fraenkel set\ntheory with the Axiom of Choice \\((\\mathbf{ZFC})\\)? It should be borne\nin mind that the very idea of axiomatic set theory is to dispense with\nhigher-order logic; its underlying logic is taken to be\n\\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). Hintikka argues as\n follows.[77]\n\nFor each sentence \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\), there is another\nsentence \\(\\phi^* = (\\exists f_1)\\ldots(\\exists f_n)\\psi^*\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) which says, intuitively, that \u2018Skolem\nfunctions\u2019 for \\(\\phi\\) exist. These \u2018Skolem\nfunctions\u2019 are certain individuals of the domain of a model of\n\\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\). Here both \\(\\phi^*\\) and \\(\\phi\\) are first-order\nsentences. But if for every sentence \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) we\nhave \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\phi^*\\) being logically equivalent, why could the\nsentences \\(\\phi^*\\) not be used for formulating a truth-predicate for\n\\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) in \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) itself? However, by\nTarski\u2019s undefinability result, no such truth-predicate\n exists.[78]\n So there must be a model of \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) and a sentence \\(\\phi\\)\ntrue in that model such that \\(\\phi^*\\) is false: not all\n\u2018Skolem functions\u2019 asserted to exist by \\(\\phi^*\\)\nactually exist in the model. \n\nThis reasoning shows that \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) does not fully capture the\nidea of truth according to which the truth of a sentence \\(\\phi\\)\nmeans that the Skolem functions for \\(\\phi\\) exist. Furthermore, it\nalso shows that the standard interpretation of higher-order logic is\nnot fully captured by \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\). To see this, observe that for\nevery sentence \\(\\phi\\) there is a logically equivalent\nsecond-order sentence \\(\\phi^{**} = (\\exists\nF_1)\\ldots(\\exists F_n)\\psi^{**}\\) actually asserting the existence of\nSkolem functions for \\(\\phi\\). The first-order sentence\n\\(\\phi^* = (\\exists f_1)\\ldots(\\exists f_n)\\psi^*\\) must not be\nconfused with the second-order sentence \\(\\phi^{**} = (\\exists\nF_1)\\ldots(\\exists F_n)\\psi^{**}\\). The Skolem functions \\(F_i\\) of\nwhich the sentence \\(\\phi^{**}\\) speaks are sets built out of\nindividuals of the set-theoretical universe, while the \u2018Skolem\nfunctions\u2019 \\(f_i\\) spoken of by \\(\\phi^*\\) are\n individuals.[79]\n\nThe conclusion of Hintikka\u2019s argument is that our ordinary\nnotion of truth is misrepresented by \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\). Furthermore, by\nTarski\u2019s undefinability result the situation cannot be improved\nby adding further axioms to \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\). In Hintikka\u2019s\njudgment, axiomatic set theory is a systematic but futile attempt to\ncapture on the first-order level truths of standardly interpreted\nsecond-order logic. Like G\u00f6del (1947), also Hintikka holds that\nthe concepts needed to state, say, the continuum hypothesis are\nsufficiently well-defined to determine the truth-value of this\nconjecture. The continuum hypothesis does not receive its meaning from\nphrasing it in \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\). G\u00f6del and Hintikka agree that\nthe independence results due to G\u00f6del himself and Paul Cohen do\nnot by themselves show anything about the truth or falsity of the\ncontinuum hypothesis. But unlike G\u00f6del, Hintikka finds the\nderivability of any conjecture whatever in \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\) (or in any\nof its extensions) simply irrelevant for the truth of the conjecture.\nFor Hintikka, it is a \u2018combinatorial\u2019 question whether\nevery infinite subset of the reals is either countable or else has the\ncardinality of the set of all reals \u2013 a question properly\nconceptualized within second-order logic. This is what Hintikka takes\nto be the pretheoretical sense of the truth of the continuum\nhypothesis, and that is not captured by\n \\(\\mathbf{ZFC}\\).[80]\n\n5.3 Extended IF first-order logic and mathematical theorizing\n\nHintikka sees \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) as allowing to reconstruct all normal\nmathematical reasoning on the first-order level. This result is\nessentially dependent on the acceptability of Hintikka\u2019s claim\nthat \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) is ontologically committed to individuals only\n(Subsect. 5.1). But how would \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) serve to\nreconstruct an important part of all mathematical reasoning?\n\nHintikka (1996: 194\u2013210) discusses mathematical\ntheories (or mathematical axiomatizations) and mathematical\nproblems (or questions of logical consequence)\nseparately.\n\nAny higher-order mathematical theory \\(T\\) gives rise to a\nmany-sorted first-order theory \\(T^*\\). If the theory is finite, there\nis a finite conjunction \\(J\\) formulated in \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) \u2013\nequivalent to a sentence of \\(\\mathbf{USO}\\) and therefore equivalent\nto the contradictory negation of an \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\) sentence and so\nindeed equivalent to the contradictory negation of an \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\nsentence \u2013 expressing the requirement that the standard\ninterpretation of higher-order logic is respected. The question of the\ntruth of the higher-order theory \\(T\\) is thus reduced to the truth of\nthe sentence \\((J \\wedge T^*)\\) of \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) (cf.\nSubsect. 4.6). \n\nThe mathematical problem of whether a given sentence \\(C\\) is\na logical consequence of a finite higher-order theory \\(T\\) coincides\nwith the problem of whether the second-order sentence \\((\\neg(J \\wedge\nT^*) \\vee C^*)\\) is valid. Recalling that there is a sentence \\(\\chi\\)\nof \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) such that \\(J\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg \\chi\\), it\nfollows that \\(\\neg(J \\wedge T^*)\\) is equivalent to a sentence of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). Consequently there is a sentence of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\)\nwhich is valid iff the sentence \\((\\neg(J \\wedge T^*) \\vee C^*)\\) is\nvalid (cf. Subsect. 4.6). Mathematical problems can be\nunderstood as questions of the validity of an\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) sentence. Among mathematical problems thus\nreconstructible using \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) are the continuum hypothesis,\nGoldbach\u2019s conjecture, Souslin\u2019s conjecture, the existence\nof an inaccessible cardinal, and the existence of a measurable\n cardinal.[81]\n\nAs conceptualizations apparently transcending the proposed framework\n\u2013 not expressible in a higher-order logic \u2013 Hintikka\nconsiders the maximality assumption expressed by David Hilbert\u2019s\nso-called axiom of completeness. The axiom says that no mathematical\nobjects can be added to the intended models without violating the\nother\n axioms.[82]\n\nIf indeed problems related to the idea of all subsets are\navoided in \\(\\mathbf{EIFL}\\) (Hintikka 1997), it offers a way of\ndefending a certain form logicism. Unlike in historical logicism, the\nidea is not to consider logic as an axiom system on the same level as\nmathematical axiom systems (Hintikka 1996:\n 183),[83]\n and to attempt to reduce mathematics to logic. Rather, Hintikka\n(1996: 184) proposes to ask: (a) Can the crucial\nmathematical concepts be defined in logical terms?\n(b) Can the modes of semantically valid logical\ninferences used in mathematics be expressed in logical terms? The idea\nis not to concentrate on deductive rules of logic: no complete set of\ndeductive rules exist anyway for \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). Because the status\nof higher-order logic is potentially dubious \u2013 due to the\nproblems associated with the notion of powerset \u2013 a positive\nsolution to questions (a) and (b) calls for a first-order logic more\npowerful than \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). \n\nThe suggested reduction of all mathematics expressible in higher-order\nlogic to the first-order level would be philosophically significant in\nshowing that mathematics is not a study of general concepts, but of\nstructures consisting of particulars (Hintikka 1996: 207). This is not\nto say that actual mathematics would be best carried out in terms of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), only that it could in principle be so carried out\n(Hintikka 1996: 205, 2006a: 477). For a critique of Hintikka\u2019s\nconclusions, see V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (2001), Feferman (2006), and\nBazzoni (2015).\n5.4 Informational independence in natural languages\n\nWhen Hintikka began to apply GTS to the study of natural language\n(Hintikka 1973a), he took up the question of whether branching\nquantifiers occur in natural languages. He was led to ask whether\nthere are semantic games with imperfect information. He detected\nvarious types of grammatical constructions in English that involve\ninformational\n independence.[84]\n An often cited example is the sentence \n\nSome relative of each villager and some relative of each townsman\nhate each other, \n\ntrue under its relevant reading when the choice of a relative of each\ntownsman can be made independently of the individual chosen for\n\u2018each\n villager.\u2019[85]\n Hintikka (1973a) sketched an argument to the effect that actually\nevery \\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\) sentence can be reproduced as a representation\nof an English sentence. From this it would follow that the logic of\nidiomatic English quantifiers is much stronger than \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\),\nand that no effective procedure exists for classifying sentences as\nanalytical or nonanalytical, synonymous or\n nonsynonymous.[86]\n This would be methodologically a very important result, showing that\nsyntactic methods are even in principle insufficient in linguistic\ntheorizing. Jon Barwise (1979) suggested that particularly convincing\nexamples supporting Hintikka\u2019s thesis can be given in terms of\ngeneralized quantifiers. \n\nLauri Carlson and Alice ter Meulen (1979) were the first to observe\ncases of informational independence between quantifiers and\nintensional operators. Consider the\n question[87]\n\nWho does everybody admire? \n\nUnder one of its readings, the presupposition of this question is\n\\((\\forall x)(\\exists y)\\) admires\\((x, y)\\). The desideratum of this\nquestion is \n\nI know who everybody admires. \n\nWriting \u2018\\(K_I\\)\u2019 for \u2018I\n know,\u2019[88]\n the desideratum has a reading whose logical form is \n\n\\(K_I (\\forall x)(\\exists y/K_I)\\) admires\\((x, y)\\). \n\nThis desideratum is satisfied by an answer pointing out a function\n\\(f\\) which yields for each person a suitable admired person. Such a\nfunction can be his or her father. Importantly, the value\n\\(f(b)\\) of this function only depends on the person \\(b\\)\ninterpreting \u2018everybody,\u2019 but does not depend on the\nscenario \\(w\\), compatible with the questioner\u2019s knowledge, that\ninterprets the construction \u2018I know.\u2019 Interestingly, the\ndesideratum \\(K_I (\\forall x)(\\exists y/K_I)\\) admires\\((x, y)\\) is\nnot expressible without an explicit independence indicator. It is also\nworth noting that this case cannot be represented in the notation of\n\\(\\mathbf{FPO}\\). This is because several types of semantic\ninteractions are possible among quantifiers and intensional operators,\nand blocking interactions of one type does not automatically block\ninteractions of other types. In the example, the witness of \\(\\exists\ny\\) must not vary with the scenario \\(w\\) interpreting the operator\n\\(K_I\\), but still the values of both variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must\nbelong to the domain of the particular scenario \\(w\\) chosen to\ninterpret\n \\(K_I\\).[89]\n\nHintikka\u2019s ideas on desiderata of wh-questions were influenced\nby his exchange with the linguist Elisabet\n Engdahl.[90]\n These wh-questions, again, functioned as important test cases for the\nappearance of informational independence in natural languages. \n\nHintikka and Sandu (1989) took up the task of formulating an explicit\nunified formal treatment for the different varieties of informational\nindependence in natural language semantics. They posed the question of\nwhich are the mechanisms that allow English to exceed the expressive\npower of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\). For, natural languages typically do not\nresort to higher-order quantifiers. Hintikka and Sandu suggested that\ninformational independence plays a key role in increasing the\nexpressive power of natural\n languages.[91]\n\nIn GTS as developed for English in Hintikka & Kulas (1983, 1985),\ngame rules are associated with a great variety of linguistic\nexpressions (cf. Subsect. 2.1). As Hintikka (1990) has\nstressed, informational independence is a cross-categorical\nphenomenon: it can occur in connection with expressions of widely\ndifferent grammatical categories. Hintikka and Sandu (1989) propose\nseveral examples from English calculated to show that there is an\nabundance of instances of informational independence in natural\nlanguages. Among examples are wh-questions of the kind discussed\nabove, and the distinction between the de dicto and de\nre readings of certain English sentences. Hintikka and Sandu\nsuggest that representing such readings in terms of IF logic is more\ntruthful to the syntax of English than the alternative, non-IF\nrepresentations are. \n\nIn connection with knowledge, a de dicto attribution such\nas\n\n\\(K_{\\textit{Ralph}} (\\exists x) (x\\) is a spy) \n\ncan be turned into a de re attribution by marking the\nexistential quantifier as independent of the knowledge-operator (cf.\nHintikka and Sandu 1989):\n\n\\(K_{\\textit{Ralph}} (\\exists x/K_{\\textit{Ralph}}) (x\\) is a spy).\n\n\nBecause knowledge is a factive attitude (the actual world is among\nRalph\u2019s epistemic alternatives), this amounts indeed to the same\nas the condition\n\n\\((\\exists x) K_{\\textit{Ralph}} (x\\) is a spy). \n\nRebuschi & Tulenheimo (2011) observed that independent quantifiers\nare of special interest in connection with non-factive attitudes such\nas belief. The logical form of a statement ascribing to Ralph a belief\npertaining to a specific but non-existent object is \n\n\\(B_{\\textit{Ralph}} (\\exists x/B_{\\textit{Ralph}}) (x\\) is a spy),\n\n\nwhere \u2018\\(B_{\\textit{Ralph}}\\)\u2019 stands for \u2018Ralph\nbelieves\n that.\u2019[92]\n\nAttitudes of this form were dubbed de objecto attitudes.\nSince the (intentional) object of such an attitude need not exist\nactually, the de objecto attitude is weaker than the de\nre attitude\n\n\\((\\exists x) B_{\\textit{Ralph}} (x\\) is a spy). \n\nOn the other hand, the pattern of operators \\(B_{\\textit{Ralph}}\n(\\exists x/B_{\\textit{Ralph}})\\) requires that the witness of the\nexistential quantifier \\(\\exists x\\) be the same relative to all\ndoxastic alternatives of Ralph, so the de objecto attitude is\nstronger than the de dicto attitude\n\n\\(B_{\\textit{Ralph}} (\\exists x) (x\\) is a spy). \n\nJanssen (2013) discusses the possibility of providing in terms of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) a compositional analysis of the de re /\nde dicto ambiguity in natural languages. Brasoveanu and\nFarkas (2011) argue that scopal properties of natural language\nindefinites are best elucidated in terms of a semantics inspired by\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), more precisely by formulating the semantics relative\nto sets of variable assignments as done in Hodges\u2019s\ncompositional semantics for slash logic. \n\nAs a rule, informational independence is not indicated syntactically\nin\n English.[93]\n Methodological consequences of this fact are discussed in Hintikka\n(1990), where he tentatively puts forward the Syntactic Silence\nThesis, according to which sufficiently radical cross-categorical\nphenomena are not likely to be marked syntactically in natural\nlanguages. Evidence for this thesis would, for its part, be evidence\nagainst the sufficiency of syntax-oriented approaches to\nsemantics.\n6. Related logics\n6.1 Slash logic\n\nSyntactically slash logic uses quantifiers like \\((\\exists x/y)\\)\ninstead of quantifiers such as \\((\\exists x/\\forall y)\\). Semantically\nslash logic is otherwise like \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) except that its\ngame-theoretical semantics is based on the idea that a player\u2019s\nstrategy functions may utilize as their arguments any\npreceding moves made in the current play, save for those whose use is,\nby the slash notation, explicitly indicated as forbidden (cf.\nSect. 3). That is, also a player\u2019s own earlier moves\nmay appear as arguments of a strategy function. This can make a\ndifference in the presence of imperfect information. For example,\nconsider evaluating the slash-logic sentence \\((\\forall x)(\\exists\ny)(\\exists z/x) x = z\\) containing the vacuous quantifier \\(\\exists\ny\\). This sentence is true on a two-element domain, since player 2 can\ncopy as the value of \\(y\\) the value that player 1 has chosen for\n\\(x\\), and then select the value of \\(z\\) using a strategy function\nwhose only argument is the value of \\(y\\). (For this phenomenon of\n\u2018signaling,\u2019 see Hodges 1997a, Sandu 2001, Janssen &\nDechesne 2006, Barbero 2013.) By contrast, the IF sentence \\((\\forall\nx)(\\exists y)(\\exists z/\\forall x) x = z\\) fails to be true on such a\ndomain, since there a strategy function for \\((\\exists z/\\forall x)\\)\nmust be a constant, and no such strategy function can guarantee a win\nfor player 2 against both possible values that player 1 can choose for\n\\(x\\). As mentioned in Subsection 4.4, Hodges (1997a,b)\nshowed that slash logic admits of an alternative, compositional\nsemantics. This requires evaluating formulas relative to sets of\nvariable assignments, instead of single assignments as in connection\nwith \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\).\n\nAll authors having studied slash logic, apart from Hodges himself,\nhave opted for not following Hodges\u2019s terminological recommendation\nmentioned at the beginning of Section 3: they have referred to slash\nlogic as \u2018IF logic.\u2019\n\nKuusisto (2013) studies the expressive power of fragments of slash\nlogic whose formulas are formed without employing the identity symbol.\nKontinen et al. (2014) investigate the complexity-theoretic\nproperties of the two-variable fragment of slash logic and compare\nthis fragment to the corresponding fragment of dependence logic.\nHodges (1997a,b) and Figueira et al. (2009, 2011, 2014)\ndiscuss an extension of slash logic in which the contradictory\nnegation of slash-logic sentences can be expressed.\n\nIn Sevenster (2014), patterns of quantifier dependence and\nindependence in quantifier prefixes of slash-logical formulas are\nsystematically studied in order to determine which quantifier prefixes\nallow slash logic to gain the expressive power of \\(\\mathbf{ESO}\\).\nSevenster identifies two such patterns \u2013 the signaling\npattern and the Henkin pattern \u2013 and proves that they\nare able to express \\(\\mathbf{NP}\\)-hard decision problems. He further\nshows that these two are the only patterns allowing slash logic to\nexceed the expressive power of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) insofar as attention is\nconfined to formulas in prenex form. An example of the signaling\npattern would be \\( (\\forall u)(\\exists v)(\\exists w/u) \\) and of the\nHenkin pattern \\( (\\forall x)(\\exists u)(\\forall y)(\\exists v/x,u)\n \\).[94]\n\n\nBarbero (2021) and Barbero et al. (2021) take up the task of\ninvestigating fragments of the general syntax of slash logic (not all\nof whose formulas are in prenex form). Thereby these authors wish to\nstudy systematically those expressive resources of slash logic that\nallow it to exceed the expressive power of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) and that do\nnot simply derive from its capacity to mimick Henkin quantifiers.\nWhile many of the features studied in these two papers depend on the\nEigenart of slash logic, the phenomenon of signaling by\ndisjunction occurs in IF logic, as well. In Section 3.3, it was\nseen that the IF-logical sentence \\((\\forall x)(\\exists y/\\forall x) x\n= y\\) is non-determined in any model whose domain has exactly two\nelements. The slash-logical sentence \\((\\forall x)(\\exists y/ x) x =\ny\\) is likewise non-determined in such a model. Now, consider the\nresult of replacing in the latter sentence the expression \\((\\exists\ny/ x) x = y\\) by the disjunction \\(((\\exists y/x) x = y \\vee (\\exists\ny/ x) x = y))\\), with a token of the initial expression in both\ndisjuncts: \n\\[\n(\\forall x)((\\exists y/ x) x = y \\vee (\\exists y/x) x = y).\n\\]\n The sentence that has been thus obtained is\nactually true in a model whose domain consists of the objects\n\\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let \\(f\\), \\(g\\), and \\(h\\) be respectively the\nstrategy functions of player 2 for the unique token of the disjunction\nsymbol, the left token of the existential quantifier, and the right\ntoken of the existential quantifier \u2013 defined as follows. First,\n\\(f\\) selects the left disjunct if player 1 has chosen \\(a\\) as a\nvalue of \\(x\\), selecting the right disjunct otherwise. Further, \\(g\\)\nand \\(h\\) are constants (zero-place functions): \\(g= a\\) and \\(h= b\\).\nThe set \\(\\{f, g, h\\}\\) is clearly a winning strategy for player 2.\nEither of the tokens of the existential quantifier occur in a specific\ndisjunct. Using the strategy function \\(f\\) to arrive at such a\ndisjunct makes sure that the disjunct arrived at reveals the choice\nthat player 1 has made to interpret \\(\\forall x\\). The constants \\(g\\)\nand \\(h\\) are selected so as to render this information explicit.\nThus, the resulting values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) indeed satisfy the\nformula \\(x= y\\). By the same reasoning it is seen that the sentence\n\\((\\forall x)((\\exists y/ \\forall x) x = y \\vee (\\exists y/\\forall x)\nx = y)\\) of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) is true in the model considered.\n6.2 Dependence logic\n\nJouko V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (2007) formulated a new approach to IF\nlogic that he dubbed dependence logic \\((\\mathbf{DL})\\); for\nfurther work on \\(\\mathbf{DL}\\), see e.g. Kontinen et\nal. (2013). The syntax of \\(\\mathbf{DL}\\) is obtained from that\nof \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) by allowing atomic formulas of the following\nspecial form:  \n\\[\n=(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n; x_{n+1}).\n\\]\n\n\nIntuitively such a formula means that the value of \\(x_{n+1}\\) depends\nonly on the values of \\(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n\\). The semantics of\n\\(\\mathbf{DL}\\) cannot be formulated relative to single variable\nassignments like that of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\): we cannot explicate what it\nmeans for the value of \\(x_{n+1}\\) to depend on those of \\(x_1 ,\\ldots\n,x_n\\) with reference to a single assignment on the variables \\(x_1\n,\\ldots ,x_{n+1}\\). For example, consider the assignment described\nbelow: \n\n\n\\(x_1\\)\n\\(x_2\\)\n\\(x_3\\) \n\n7\n5\n8 \n\n\nRelative to this assignment, all of the following claims hold:\nwhenever the value of \\(x_1\\) equals 7, the value of \\(x_3\\) equals 8;\nwhenever the value of \\(x_2\\) equals 5, the value of \\(x_3\\) equals 8;\nwhenever the value of \\(x_1\\) equals 7 and the value of \\(x_2\\) equals\n5, the value of \\(x_3\\) equals 8; irrespective of the values of\n\\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), the value of \\(x_3\\) equals 8. The question of\ndependence only becomes interesting and non-vacuous relative to a set\nof assignments:\n\n\n\\(x_1\\)\n\\(x_2\\)\n\\(x_3\\) \n\n7\n5\n8 \n\n9\n5\n6 \n\n7\n11\n8 \n\n7\n3\n8 \n\n9\n19\n6 \n\n\nThe set \\(X\\) consisting of the above five assignments satisfies the\nformula \\(=(x_1\\); \\(x_3)\\): the value of \\(x_3\\) depends only on the\nvalue of \\(x_1\\). As is readily observed, any two assignments in \\(X\\)\nwhich assign the same value to \\(x_1\\) assign also the same value to\n\\(x_3\\). The interesting novelty of \\(\\mathbf{DL}\\) is that claims\nabout variable dependencies are made at the atomic level. Quantifiers\nof \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) and those of slash logic with their independence\nindications easily lead to somewhat messy formulas, whereas\n\\(\\mathbf{DL}\\) looks exactly like \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), apart from its\ngreater flexibility in forms of atomic formulas.\n7. Conclusion\n\nIn this entry IF first-order logic and extended IF first-order logic\nhave been surveyed. Their metalogical properties have been explained\nand the philosophical relevance of these properties has been\ndiscussed. The suggested consequences of these logics for\nphilosophical issues such as the existence of a self-applied\ntruth-predicate, the logicist program, the philosophical relevance of\naxiomatic set theory, and informational independence in natural\nlanguages have been covered as well. Slash logic and dependence logic\n\u2013 both closely related to \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) and inspired by it\n\u2013 were also briefly considered.\n",
