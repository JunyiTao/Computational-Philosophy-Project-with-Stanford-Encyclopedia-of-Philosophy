He started by augmenting the laws of his 1847\nalgebra of logic (without explicitly saying that his previous list of\nthree axioms was inadequate), and made some comments on the rule of\ninference (performing the same operation on both sides of an\nequation). But then he casually stated that the foundation of his\nsystem actually rested on a single (new) principle, namely it sufficed\nto check an argument by seeing if it was correct when the class\nsymbols took on only the values 0 and 1, and the operations were the\nusual arithmetical operations. Let us call this Boole\u2019s Rule of 0\nand 1. No meaningful justification was given for Boole\u2019s adoption\nof this new foundation, it was not given a special name, and the scant\nreferences to it in the rest of the book were usually rather clumsily\nstated. For a modern analysis of this Rule of 0 and 1 see Burris &\nSankappanavar 2013.\n\nThe development of the algebra of logic in the Laws of\nThought proceeded much as in his 1847 book, with minor changes to\nhis translation scheme, and with the selection operators replaced by\nclasses. There is a new and very important theorem (correcting the one\nhe had used in 1847), the Elimination Theorem, which says the\nfollowing: given an equation \\(F(x,y, z, \\ldots) = 0\\) in the class\nsymbols \\(x, y, z\\), etc., the most general conclusion that follows\nfrom eliminating certain of the class symbols is obtained by (1)\nsubstituting 0s and 1s into \\(F(x, y, z, \\ldots)\\) for the symbols to\nbe eliminated, in all possible ways, then (2) multiplying these\nvarious substitution instances together and setting the product equal\nto 0. Thus eliminating \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) from \\(F(x, y, z) = 0\\) gives\n\\(F(x, 0, 0)F(x, 0, 1)F(x, 1, 0)F(x, 1, 1) = 0\\). This theorem also\nplayed an important role in Boole\u2019s interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s\nsyllogistic.\n\nFrom an algebra of logic point of view, the 1854 treatment at times\nseems less elegant than that in the 1847 book, but it gives a much\nricher insight into how Boole thinks about the foundations for his\nalgebra of logic. The final chapter on logic, Chapter XV, was an\nattempt to give a uniform proof of the Aristotelian conversions and\nsyllogisms. (It is curious that prior to Chapter XV Boole did not\npresent any examples of arguments involving particular propositions.)\nThe details of Chapter XV are quite involved, mainly because of the\nincrease in size of expressions when the Elimination and Development\nTheorems are applied. Boole simply left most of the work to the\nreader. Later commentators would gloss over this chapter, and no one\nseems to have worked through its details.\n\nAside from the Rule of 0 and 1 and the Elimination Theorem, the 1854\npresentation is mainly interesting for Boole\u2019s attempts to justify his\nalgebra of logic. He argued that in symbolical algebra it was quite\nacceptable to carry out equational deductions with partial operations,\njust as one would when the operations were total, as long as the terms\nin the premises and the conclusion were interpretable. He said this\nwas the way ordinary algebra worked with the uninterpretable\n\\(\\sqrt{-1}\\), the square root of \u22121. (The geometric\ninterpretation of complex numbers was recognized early on by Wessel,\nArgand, and Gauss, but it was only with the publications of Gauss and\nHamilton in the 1830s that doubts about the acceptability of complex\nnumbers in the larger mathematical community were overcome. It is\ncurious that in 1854 Boole regarded \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) as\nuninterpretable.)\n\nThere were a number of concerns regarding Boole\u2019s approach to the\nalgebra of logic:\n\nWas there a meaningful tie between his algebra of logic and the\nalgebra of numbers, or was it just an accident that they were so\nsimilar?\nCould one handle particular propositions in an algebraic logic\nthat focused on equations?\nWas it really acceptable to work with uninterpretable terms in\nequational derivations?\nWas Boole using \u201cAristotelian\u201d semantics (the\nsemantics presupposed in traditional logic, where the extension of a\nterm is nonempty)?\n\n",
