    "main_text": "\n\nAmong the questions to be raised under the heading of \u201cpersonal\nidentity\u201d are these: \u201cWhat are we?\u201d (fundamental\nnature question) and \u201cUnder what conditions do we persist\nthrough time?\u201d (persistence question). Against the dominant\nneo-Lockean approach to these questions, the view known as animalism\nanswers that each of us is an organism of the species Homo\nsapiens and that the conditions of our persistence are those of\nanimals. Beyond describing the content and historical background of\nanimalism and its rivals, this entry explores some of the arguments\nfor and objections to this controversial account of our nature and\npersistence.\n",
