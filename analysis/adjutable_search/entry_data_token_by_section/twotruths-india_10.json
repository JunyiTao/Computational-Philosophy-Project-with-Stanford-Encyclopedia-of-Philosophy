All the theories of truth and knowledge\nadvanced in these systems from his Madhyamaka point of view are too\nrigid to be of any significant use. Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s critiques of\n\u0100bhidharmikas\u2014Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika and\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2014and Yog\u0101c\u0101ra predominantly target the\nontological foundationalism which underpins their theories of the\nultimate truth. He rejects them on the ground that from an analytic\ncognitive perspective, which scrutinises the nature of reality,\nnothing\u2014subject and object\u2014is found to be ultimately real\nsince all things are rationally reduced to spatial parts or temporal\nmoments. Thus he proposes the view that both the subject and the\nobject are conventionally intrinsically real as both are\nconventional truths, where as both are ultimately\nintrinsically unreal as both are empty of ultimate reality, hence\nemptiness alone is the ultimate reality.\n\nAlthough Bh\u0101vavevika is said to have founded the Sv\u0101tantrika\nMadhyamaka, it is important to note that there exists two different\nsubschools of the Sv\u0101tantrika tradition:\n\nSautr\u0101ntika Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\n\n\nThe two schools of the Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka take\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s intepretation of the two truths, on the whole, to\nbe more cogent than the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s. Particularly both\nschools reject ultimate intrinsic reality while positing\nconventional intrinsic reality. As far as the presentation of\nultimate truth is concerned both schools are in\nagreement\u2014nonself or emptiness alone is the ultimate reality,\nand the rest\u2014the entire range of dharmas\u2014are ultimately\nempty of any intrinsic reality. Nevertheless, the two schools differ\nslightly on the matter related to the theory of conventional truth,\nspecifically concerning reality or unreality of the external or\nphysical objects on the conventional level. The Sautr\u0101ntika\nSv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka view held by Bh\u0101vavevika himself, and\nhis student J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha, affirms intrinsic reality of the\nconventional truths of both the outer domains and the inner domains\nand mental faculty along with their six respective\nconsciousnesses.\n\nThe arguments that affirm the conventional reality of the external\nobjects are the same arguments that Bh\u0101vavevika employed to\ncriticise the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra arguments rejecting the reality of\nexternal objects. Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s [MadhHK] 5.15 points out\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s arguments are contradicted by perception\n(pratyak\u1e63a), tradition (\u0101gama) and commonse sense\n(lokaprasiddha), since they all prove the correctness of the cogniton\nof material form ([MadhHK] 5.15 Dbu ma dza 20b and\nTarkajv\u0101l\u0101 5.15 Dbu ma dza 204ab).\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s dream argument is also rejected because,\naccording to Bh\u0101vavevika, dream-consciousness and so forth have\ndharmas as their objects (\u0101lambana / dmigs pa) ([MadhHK]\n5.19 Dbu ma dza 20b). And dharmas are based on intrinsically real\nconventional objects, because they are the repeated impression of the\nobjects that have been experienced previously, like memory\n(Tarkajv\u0101l\u0101 5.19 Dbu ma dza 205a).\n\nThe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka view held by\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and his student Kamala\u015b\u012bla\naffirms conventionally intrinsic reality of the inner domains and\nrejects the intrinsic reality of the outer domains and it claims the\nexternal objects are mere conceptual fictions.\n4.1.1 Sautr\u0101ntika Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\n\nOf the two schools of Sv\u0101tantraka we shall first take up the\ntheory of the two truths presented in the Sautr\u0101ntika\nSv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka. Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s position represents\nthe theory of the two truths held by this school which was later\npromoted by his disciple J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha. The cornerstones of\nthe Sautr\u0101ntika Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka theory of the two\ntruths are the following theses:\n\nThat at the level of conventional truth all phenomena are\nintrinsically real (svabh\u0101vata\u1e25), because they are\nestablished as intrinsic realities from the perspective of the\nnon-analytical cognitions of the na\u00efve ordinary beings. Allied to\nthis thesis is Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s claim that the Madhyamaka accepts,\nconventionally, the intrinsic reality of things, for it is the\nintrinsic reality that defines what is to be conventionally real.\nThat at the level of ultimate truth, all phenomena, with the\nexception of the emptiness which is ultimately real, are intrinsically\nunreal (ni\u1e25svabh\u0101vata\u1e25), or ultimately unreal,\nbecause they are established as empty of any intrinsic reality from\nthe perspective of analytical exalted cognition (i.e., ultimate\ncognition of \u0101rya-beings). Allied to this thesis is\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s claim that Madhyamaka rejects intrinsic reality at\nthe ultimate level since ultimate reality constitutes that which is\nintrinsically unreal, therefore empty.\n\nConventional truth\n\nWe shall consider Sautr\u0101ntika Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\u2019s\ndefence of the two claims in turn. We will begin first with\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s definition of the conventional truth. In the\nTarkajv\u0101l\u0101, he defines conventional truths as an\n\u201cincontrovertible (phyin ci ma log pa) linguistic\nconvention.\u201d (Dbu ma dza 56a) Such conventional truth\non Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s Sv\u0101tantrika takes two forms\u2014unique\nparticulars (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a / rang mtshan) and universals\n(s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a / spyi mtshan) as the\nTarkajv\u0101l\u0101 III.8, explains:\n\nPhenomena have dual characteristics (lak\u1e63ana / mtshan nyid),\ndifferentiated as being universal or unique. Unique particular\n(svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a / rang mtshan) is a thing\u2019s intrinsic reality\n(svabh\u0101vat\u0101 / rang gi ngo bo), the domain of engagement\nwhich is definitively ascertained by a non-conceptual cognition\n(nirvikalpena j\u00f1\u0101nena / rnam par rtog pa med pa\u2019i shes\npa). Universal (s\u0101m\u0101\u1e45yalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) is a\ncognitive domain to be apprehended by an inferential cognition\n(anumanavij\u00f1\u0101nena / rjes su dpog pa\u2019i shes pa) which is\nconceptual (Dbu ma dza 55b).\n\nIn this passage Bh\u0101vavevika essentially summarises some of the\nkey features of conventional truths which are also critical to\nunderstanding the differences between the Sv\u0101tantrika and\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika.\n\nBh\u0101vavevika accepts, based on this passage, unique particular\n(svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) as an integral part of the ontological\nstructure of the conventional truth. The Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika, by\ncontrast, rejects the concept of unique particular even at the level\nof conventional truth.\nBh\u0101vavevika ascribes unique particular an ontological\nqualification of being \u201cintrinsically real\u201d\n(svabh\u0101vat\u0101), or \u201cinherently real\u201d as its given\nstatus, explicitly affirming a form of foundationalism of unique\nparticulars at the level of conventional truth, which the\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika totally rejects.\nBh\u0101vavevika endorses the Pram\u0101\u1e47ika\u2019s epistemology\nin which unique particular, which is intrinsically real,\nconventionally, is considered as the domain of engagement ascertained\nby a non-conceptual cognition. The universal\n(s\u0101m\u0101\u1e45yalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) is considered as the\ndomain to be apprehended by a conceptual inferential cognition.\n\n\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s defence of the thesis that conventionally things\nare intrinsically real can be summed up in two arguments. First, as\nfar as things are conventional realities they are also intrinsic or\ninherent realities, for being intrinsically real is the reason why\nthings are designated as \u201cconventional reality,\u201d since\nfrom a conventional standpoint\u2014i.e., non-analytical cognitive\nengagements of the ordinary beings\u2014things do appear to be\ninherently real. This means that being \u201cintrinsic\u201d is, for\nBh\u0101vavevika, what makes conventional reality a\nreality.\n\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s second argument states that as long as a\nM\u0101dhyamika accepts conventional reality it must also accept\nthings as intrinsic in order to avoid the nihilism charge, for\nconventional reality is defined in terms of its being intrinsically\nand uniquely real (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a). Denying intrinsic reality\nof things at the conventional level, would therefore entail the denial\nof their conventional existence, since it would entail the denial of\nthe defining characteristics of the conventional reality. This follows\nsays Bh\u0101vavevika because \u201cThe Lord (bh\u0101gvan / bcom\nldan ldas) has taught the two truths. Based on this [explanatory\nschema] conventionally things are posited in terms of their intrinsic\nnatures and [unique] particulars ([sva]lak\u1e63a\u1e47a / mtshan\nnyid). It is only ultimately that [things are] posited as having no\nintrinsic reality\u201d ((Dbu ma dza 60a).\nUltimate truth\n\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s second thesis is that at the level of ultimate\ntruth, all phenomena are intrinsically unreal\n(ni\u1e25svabh\u0101vata\u1e25), therefore Madhyamaka rejects\nintrinsic reality ultimately. Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s\nTarkajv\u0101l\u0101 3.26 offers three ways to interpret the\ncompound param\u0101rtha \u201cultimate domain\u201d or\n\u201cultimate object\u201d literally. In the first, both the terms\n\u201cultimate\u201d (param) and \u201cdomain\u201d (artha) stands\nfor the object\u2014emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101)\u2014because\nit is both the \u201cultimate\u201d or \u201cfinal\u201d as well\nas an \u201cobject to be known,\u201d \u201canalysed\u201d\n(par\u012bk\u1e63a\u1e47\u012bya / brtag par bya ba) and\n\u201cunderstood\u201d (pratip\u0101dya / go bar bya ba). In the\nsecond compound, param\u0101rtha stands for \u201cobject of the\nultimate\u201d (paramasya artha / dam pa\u2019i don) where\n\u201cobject\u201d refers to emptiness and \u201cultimate\u201d\nrefers to a non-conceptual exalted cognition\n(nirvikalpaj\u00f1\u0101na / rnam par mi rtog pa\u2019i ye shes) of the\nmeditative equipoise (sam\u0101hita / mnyam bzhag). In the third\ncompound param\u0101rth stands for a concordant ultimate (rjes su\nmthun pa\u2019i shes rab), a cognition that accords with the knowledge of\nthe ultimate since it has the ultimate as its domain.\n\nThe first two etymological senses of the term param\u0101rthas have in\nthem the sense of emptiness as an objective domain since it is both\nthe final ontic status of things and it is the ultimate object of a\nnon-conceptual exalted cognition. Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s third\netymological sense of the term param\u0101rtha has it identified with\ncognition that accords with the knowledge of the ultimate truth on the\nground that such cognition has emptiness as its object and such\nknowledge is a means through which one develops a non-conceptual\nknowledge of ultimate reality. This third sense of param\u0101rtha\nallows Bh\u0101vavevika to argue that a cognition of the subsequent\nattainment (p\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dhalabdhaj\u00f1\u0101na / rjes\nthob ye shes) which directly follows from the non-conceptual\nmeditative equipoise, while it is conceptual in character, is\nnevertheless a concordant ultimate ([PPMV] Dbu ma tsa\n228a).\n\nSo for Bh\u0101vavevika then, \u201cthe ultimate is of two kinds: one\nis transcendent (lokuttara / \u2018jig rten las \u2018das pa),\nundefiled (zag pa med pa), free from elaboration (aprapa\u00f1ca /\nspros med) which needs to be engaged without a deliberative effort.\nThe second one\u201d as he explains in Tarkajv\u0101l\u0101\n3.26 \u201cis elaborative (pr\u0101pa\u00f1ca / spros pa), hence it\ncan be engaged with a deliberative effort by means of a correct\nmundane cognitive process (dag pa\u2019i \u2018jig rten pa\u2019i ye shes) that\nis sustained by the collective force of virtues (bsod nams) and\ninsights (ye shes)\u201d (Dbu ma dza 60b).\n\nBh\u0101vavevika advances several arguments to defend the thesis that\nultimately all are intrinsically unreal. The first is the\nconditionality argument pertaining to the four elements, according to\nwhich, all the four elements are ultimately empty of any intrinsic\nreality, for they all are conditioned by the causal factors\nappropriated for their becoming and their existence.\n\nThe second is Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s non-foundationalist ontological\nargument which demonstrates all phenomena, including the atoms, are\nultimately non-foundational, for ultimately there is nothing that can\nbe taken as the foundational entity (dravya) or intrinsically real\nsince the ultimate analysis reveals that all phenomena are composed of\nthe atomic particles that are themselves composites.\n\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s third non-foundationalist epistemological argument\nshows that ultimately the objects are not the domain of cognitions.\nThe argument says that \u201cA visible form is not ultimately\napprehended by the visual faculty because it is a composite (bsags)\nlike a sound and because it is a product of the elements like the\nsound.\u201d ([MadhHK] 3.33 Dbu ma dza 5a) The reasons\nprovided to justify the thesis are twofold: (i) being composite and\n(ii) being a product of the elements. Given that being\ncomposites and products equally apply to visible\nform and sound, these two reasons cannot warrant the validity of the\nargument justifying the thesis that a visible form is ultimately\napprehended by the visual faculty. If they did, they would equally\nwarrant the validity of the argument justifying the thesis that a\nsound is ultimately apprehended by the visual faculty (Dbu ma\ndza 65ab).\n\nIn conclusion: mirroring these two critically important philosophical\npositions Bh\u0101vavevika introduces a type of method or pedagogical\ndevice that is unique to the Sv\u0101tantrika contra to his\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika counterpart.\n4.1.2 Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\n\nIn the early eighth century Bh\u0101vavevika and\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha\u2019s theory of the two truths was adopted and\nelucidated in the works of the latter\u2019s\n student[12]\n \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (705\u2013762) and his student\nKamala\u015b\u012bla (ca. 725\u2013788). \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nwrote:\n\nVerses on the Ornament of the Middle Way\n(Madhyamak\u0101la\u1e41k\u0101rak\u0101rik\u0101 [MAK], Dbu\nma sa 53a\u201356b),\nCommentary on the Verses of the Ornament of the Middle Way\n(Madhyamak\u0101la\u1e41k\u0101rav\u1e5btti,  [MAV], Dbu\nma sa 56b\u201384a).\n\n\nIn these works he argues for the synthesis of Madhyamaka and\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s theories of the two truths which resulted in the\nformation of the Yogac\u0101r\u0101-Sv\u0101tantrika\nMadhyamaka\u2014a subschool within the Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka.\nKamala\u015b\u012bla, who is a student of\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, held the same conception of the two\ntruths in his works:\n\nSubcommentary on the Ornament of the Middle Way\n(Madhyamak\u0101la\u1e41k\u0101rapa\u00f1jik\u0101, Dbu ma\nsa 84a\u2013133b),\nLight of the Middle Way\n(Madhyamak\u0101loka\u1e25 [MA], Dbu ma sa\n133b\u2013244a),\nDiscussion on the Light of Reality\n(Tattv\u0101loka-nama-prakara\u1e47a, Dbu ma sa\n244b\u2013273a),\nEstablishing the Non-intrinsic Reality of All Phenomena\n(Sarvadharm\u0101svabh\u0101vasiddhi, Dbu ma sa\n273a\u2013291a),\nStages of Meditation (Bh\u0101van\u0101krama,\nDbu ma ki 22a\u201368b).\n\n\nUnlike J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha and Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s realistic\nSautr\u0101ntika Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka which presents\nconventional truth in agreement with the epistemological realism of\nthe Sautr\u0101ntika and ultimate truth in agreement with\nnon-foundationalist ontology of the Madhyamaka,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla advocate the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka. They each maintain a\nbasic presentation of conventional truth in agreement with the\nepistemological idealism of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra and the presentation of\nultimate truth in agreement with the ontological non-foundationalism\nof the Madhyamaka. Therefore \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita concludes:\n\u201cBy relying on the Mind Only (cittamatra / sems tsam) one\nunderstands that external phenomena do not exist. And by relying on\nthis [i.e., Madhyamaka] one understands that even [the mind] is\nthoroughly nonself.\u201d ([MAK] 23 Dbu ma sa 56a) \u201cTherefore,\none attains a Mah\u0101y\u0101na [path] when one is able to ride the\nchariots of the two systems by holding to the reigns of logic.\u201d\n([MAK] 24 Dbu ma sa 56a) By \u201cthe two systems\u201d\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita meant, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s account of\nthe conventional truth with Madhyamaka\u2019s account of the ultimate\n truth.[13]\n\nUnderlying this syncretistic view of the two truths lay two\nfundamental theses that Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\nare committed\u2014namely:\n\nthat there is no real external object, mind is the only thing that\nis conventionally real, hence Yog\u0101c\u0101ra is right about its\npresentation of the conventional truth; and\nthat even mind is unreal and empty of any intrinsic nature under\nultimate analysis, therefore nothing is ultimately real, hence\nMadhyamaka is right about its presentation of the ultimate truth.\n\n\nAnd it is precisely the synthesis of these two theses that defines the\ncharacteristic of the theory of the two truths in the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka.\n\u015a\u0101ntara\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla attempt to\nachieve this distinctive syncretistic characteristic in their works to\nwhich we turn our discussion.\nUltimate truth\n\nWe will follow \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla\nand first take up the second major thesis\u2014ultimately everything,\nincluding the mind, is unreal and empty. Therefore, ultimate truth is\nthe emptiness of any intrinsic reality. According to\nKamala\u015b\u012bla ultimate truth has three senses: ([MA], Dbu\nma sa 233b)\n\nreality, the nature of which is characterised as \u201cnonself of\nperson\u201d and \u201cnonself of phenomena,\u201d is etymologically\nboth ultimate (param / dam pa) and object (artha / don).\ntranscendent knowledge (lokottara\u1e41\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e43), reliable cognition of the ultimate since it\nis directly engaged with ultimate reality.\nmundane knowledge, while not in itself ultimate knowledge, but\nbecause it is a complementary means of transcendent knowledge, it is\nalso identified as the ultimate.\n\n\nBoth \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla maintains\nthat the emptiness of intrinsic reality is the ultimate truth, and in\norder to demonstrate that this is so, Kamala\u015b\u012bla deploys\nfive forms of arguments\u2014namely:\n\nThe diamond-sliver argument (vajraka\u1e45\u0101diyukti / irdo\nrje gzegs ma\u2019i gtan tshigs) which shows that all things are empty of\nintrinsic reality because things are analytically not found to\narise\u2014neither from themselves, nor from another nor both nor\ncauselessly ([MA], Dbu ma sa 190a\u2013202b).\nThe argument refuting the arising of existent and non-existent\nentities (sadasadutp\u0101daprati\u1e63edhahetu / yod med skye\n\u2018gog gi gtan tshigs) which shows that all things are empty\nof intrinsic reality because their intrinsic reality is not found to\narise either from things that exist or from things that do not exist\n([MA], Dbu ma sa 202b).\nThe arguments refuting the four modes of arising\n(catu\u1e63ko\u1e6diyutp\u0101daprati\u1e63edhahetu / mu bzhi\nskye \u2018gog gi gtan tshigs) which shows that things are empty\nof intrinsic reality for the reason that such reality is neither found\nanaytically in existence (or being) nor in nonexistence (or nonbeing)\nnor both existence-nonexistence (being-nonbeing) nor neither existence\nnor nonexistence (neither being nor nonbeing) ([MA], Dbu ma\nsa 210b).\nThe neither-one-nor many argument (ek\u0101nekaviyogahetu /\ngcig du bral gyi gtan tshigs) which shows all phenomena are empty\nof intrinsic reality because they all lack the characteristics of\nbeing intrinsically one or intrinsically many ([MA], Dbu ma\nsa 218b).\nThe argument from dependent arising\n(prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101dahetu / rten \u2018brel gyi gtan\ntshigs) which shows that things are produced from the association\nof multiple causes and condition, and therefore showing that things do\nnot have any intrinsic reality of their own ([MA], Dbu ma sa\n205b).\n\n\nThe most well-known of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u015bita\u2019s arguments is the\nneither-one-nor many\n argument,[14]\n which seeks to examine the final (or ultimate) identity (ngo bo\nla dpyod pa) of all phenomena. In his [MAK] and [MAV]\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita develops this argument in a great detail.\nThe essential feature of the argument is as follows: \u201cThe\nentities that are proclaimed by our own [Buddhist] schools and the\nother [non-Buddhist] schools, lack intrinsic identity because in\nreality their identity is neither a (1) singular nor a (2)\nplural\u2014like a reflection.\u201d ([MAK] 1, Dbu ma sa\n53a) In this argument:\n\nThe subject (rtsod gzhi cos can): the entities that are\nproclaimed by our own Buddhist schools and the other non-Buddhist\nschools (from here on \u2018all entities.)\nThe property to be proved (s\u0101dhyadharma / sgrub\nbya\u2019i chos) : the lack of intrinsic identity.\nWhat is being proved (s\u0101dhya / sgrub bya) :\nall entities lack the intrinsic identity.\nThe reason (hetu / rtags) or means of proof (s\u0101dhana\n/ sgrub byed) : in reality their identity is neither a\nsingular nor a plural.\nExample: like a reflection.\n\n\nAccording to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita the validity of the\nneither-one-nor many argument depends on whether or not it satisfies\nthe triple criteria (trir\u016bpali\u1e45ga / tshul gsum) of\nformal probative reasoning. The first criterion\n(pak\u1e63adharmat\u0101 / phyogs chos) shows that the\nreason qualifies the subject (phyogs / pak\u1e63a or chos can /\ndharmin), i.e., that the subject must be proven to have the\nproperty of the reason. That is, all entities must be shown, in\nreality, as neither singular nor plural. And therefore this argument\nconsists of two premises:\n\nthe premise that shows the lack of singularity\n(\u201cunity\u201d) and\nthe premise that shows the lack of plurality (or\n\u201cmany-ness\u201d)\n\n\nIn [MAK] and [MAV] \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita develops the argument\nshowing the lack of singularity in two parts: (i) the argument that\nshows the lack of the non-pervasive singularity in (a)\npermanent phenomena, and (b) in impermanent entities; and (ii) the\nargument that shows the lack of pervasive singularity by (a)\nrefuting the indivisible atomic particles which are said to have\ncomposed the objects, and (b) by refuting the unified consciousness\nposited by Yog\u0101c\u0101ra.\n\nThe premise that shows the lack of plurality is based upon the\nconclusion of the argument that shows the lack of singularity. This is\nso, argues \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, because \u201cWhen we\nanalyse any entity, none is [found] to be a singular. For that for\nwhich nothing is singular, there must also be nothing which is\nplural\u201d ([MAK] 61, Dbu ma sa 55a). This argument of\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita proceeds from understanding that being\nsingular and being plural (manifold) are essentially\ninterdependent\u2014if there are no singular entity, one must accept\nthat there are no plural entity either since the latter is the former\nassembled.\n\nAccording to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita the argument from\nneither-one-nor many satisfies the triple criteria of valid reasoning.\nIt satisfies the first criterion because all instances of the subject,\nnamely the intrinsic identities of those entities asserted by the\nBuddhist and non-Buddhist opponents, are instances of entities which\nare neither singular nor plural. The second criterion of a valid\nreason\u2014the proof of the forward entailment\n(anvayavy\u0101pti / rjes khyab), i.e., the proof that the\nreason occurs in only \u201csimilar instances\u201d\n(sapak\u1e63a / mthun phyogs) where all instances of the\nreason are the instances of the predicates\u2014is also satisfied\nbecause the reason\u2014all phenomena are neither singular nor\nplural\u2014is an instance of the predicate\u2014phenomena which\nlack identity. The third criterion of a valid reason\u2014the proof\nof the counter entailment (vyatirekavy\u0101pti / ldog khyab /\nldog khyab), or the proof that the reason is completely absent\nfrom the dissimilar instances of the predicate (vipak\u1e63a / mi\nmthun phyogs)\u2014hold because there are no instances of the\npredicate which are not instances of the reason.\n\nThere are no instances of phenomena, which lacked intrinsic identity,\nwhich are not also instances of phenomena, that are neither singular\nnor plural. Therefore \u201cthe counter entailment holds since there\nare no entities that could be posited as existing in other possible\nalternatives\u201d ([MAV] 62 Dbu ma sa 69b).\n\nThus the second and the third criteria which are mutually entailing\nprove the entailment of the neither one-nor many argument. Once the\n entailment[15]\n of the argument is accomplished, in \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s\nview, all potential loopholes in this argument are addressed. And\ntherefore the argument successfully proves that all phenomena are\nempty of any intrinsic reality, since they all lack any singular or\nplural identity.\n\nIt is clear, then, that the arguments of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nand Kamala\u015b\u012bla have the final thrust of demonstrating the\nreasons why all phenomena ultimately lack any intrinsic\nreality, and are therefore geared towards proving the emptiness of\nintrinsic reality as the ultimate truth, in each argument a specific\ndomain of analysis is used to prove the final ontological\nposition.\nConventional Truth\n\nLet us now turn to the first thesis and look at the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-Sv\u0101tantratika Madhyamaka defence of the theory\nof conventional truth. As we have seen from the arguments such as\nneither-one-nor many, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla draw the conclusion that entities are ultimately\nempty of reality, for ultimately they do not exist either as a\nsingular or as a plural. They then move on to explain the way things\ndo exist, and \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita does this with an explicit\nadmission that things do exist conventionally\u2014\u201cTherefore\nthese entities are only conventionally defined. If [someone] accepts\nthem as ultimate, what can I do for that?\u201d ([MAK] 63 Dbu\nma sa 55a). Why is it that all entities are defined as only\nconventionally real? To understand the answer to this question, we\nneed to look at \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s definition of\nconventional reality, which consists of three criteria:\n\nit strictly appeals to its face-value and cannot be subjected to\nreasoned analysis (avic\u0101ra\u1e41a\u1e47\u012bya);\nit is causally efficient; and\nit is subjected to arising and disintegration ([MAK] 64, Dbu\nma sa 55a).\n\n\nElsewhere in [MAV] \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita also provides a\nbroader definition of conventionality (sa\u1e41v\u1e5bti / kun\nrdzob), and argues that conventionality is not simply a linguistic\nconvention (\u015babda-vyvah\u0101ra / sgra\u2019i tha snyad), it also\nincludes what is conventionally real, those that are seen and accepted\nby the M\u0101dhaymikas as dependently coarisen\n(prat\u012btyasamutpanna / rten cing \u2018brel \u2018byung), and\nthose which cannot be rationally analysed ([MAV] 65, Dbu ma\nsa 70a).\n\nKamala\u015b\u012bla\u2019s definition of conventional truth stresses\nepistemic error (br\u0101nta j\u00f1\u0101na / rnam shes khrul ba)\nin as much as he does stress on non-erroneous epistemic perspective\n(abr\u0101nta j\u00f1\u0101na / rnam shes ma khrul ba) in his\ndefinition of the ultimate truth. So on his definition, the nature of\nall entities, illusory persons and the like, is classified into two\ntruths by virtue of erroneous (br\u0101nta / khrula ba) and\nnon-erroneous cognition through which they are each represented.\n\nKamala\u015b\u012bla\u2019s definition of conventional truth makes\nexplicitly clear the synthesis between Madhayamaka and\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra. The Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\nclaims that the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra is right about the presentation of\nthe conventional truth as mere mental impressions, and that this can\nbe seen from the way in which \u015a\u0101ntara\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla defend this synthesis textually and rationally\nthrough relying heavily on the\ns\u016btras\u2014Sa\u1e43dhinirmocannas\u016btra,\nLa\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ras\u016btra,\nSaddharmapu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u012bkas\u016btra and so\nforth\u2014traditionally supporting Yog\u0101c\u0101ra idealism. The\nclaim is made here, and \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita does this\nexplicity, that the Madhyamaka and the idealistic doctrines taught in\nthese scriptures are all \u201cconsistent.\u201d ([MAV] 91 Dbu\nma sa 79a) The works of these two philosophers produce abundant\ncitations from these s\u016btra literatures stressing the\nsignificance of the passages like this from the\nLa\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ras\u016btra: \u201cMaterial forms\ndo not exist, one\u2019s mind appears to be external.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the argument, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita argues\n\u201cthat which is cause and effect is mere consciousness only. And\nwhatever is causally established abides in consciousness.\u201d\n([MAK] 91, Dbu ma sa 56a) Therefore phenomena that appear to\nbe real external objects like a blue-patch are not something that is\ndistinct from the nature of the phenomenological experience of\nblue-patch, even so, as the material form experienced in dreams is not\ndistinct from the dreaming experience ([MAV] 91 Dbu ma sa\n79a).\n\nBriefly, then, it is clear the two Sv\u0101tantriak\nschools\u2014Sautr\u0101ntika-Sv\u0101tantrika-Madhyamak and the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka\u2014both uphold the\nstandard Madhyamaka position in terms of treating emptiness as the\nultimate truth, although, they vary somewhat in their presentation of\nconventional truth since the former is realistic and the latter\nidealistic about the nature of the conventional truth.\n",
