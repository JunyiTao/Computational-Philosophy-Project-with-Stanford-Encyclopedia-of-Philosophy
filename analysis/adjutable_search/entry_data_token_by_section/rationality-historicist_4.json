    "main_text": "Historicist Conceptions of Rationality: The Battle of the Big Systems || The Pragmatic, Problem-Solving Approach\n1.5 The Pragmatic, Problem-Solving Approach\n\nLaudan opened Progress and Its Problems (1977) with the claim\nthat providing an adequate model of rationality is the primary\nbusiness of the philosopher of science but that no extant\nmethodologies fit actual science. In this book his idea of good fit\nwas fit with a selection of intuitively strong historical instances\nthat any adequate theory must explain. (Laudan 1984 and 1996: ch. 7,\nlater rejected the intuitionistic elements that gave normative punch\nto this model.) His response to the rationality question was to\npropose a thoroughgoing, explicitly pragmatic, problem-solving account\nof science. Problem-solving had been an important element in previous\naccounts, notably those of Kuhn and Popper, but Laudan\nreversed the usual account of scientific progress as a\ntemporal succession of atemporal rational decisions.  Instead of\ndefining progress in terms of rationality, we should define\nrationality in terms of progress. We cannot measure progress in terms\nof approach to an unknowable, final, metaphysical truth, but we do\nhave reliable markers of progress in terms of numbers and relative\nimportance of both empirical and conceptual problems solved by\nlong-term \u201cresearch traditions\u201d. Just as Lakatos\u2019s\nresearch programs were a compromise between Popper and Kuhn, we can\nread Laudan\u2019s \u201cresearch traditions\u201d as incorporating\nelements of his major historicist predecessors, while departing\nsharply from other tenets of their work.\n\nMany analysts have played with possible relationships between the\nsciences\u2019 assumed rationality and assumed progressiveness. The\ncentral issue for them is analogous to the question in Rodgers and\nHammerstein\u2019s Cinderella: Is science progressive\nbecause it\u2019s rational, or is it rational because it\u2019s\nprogressive? (Kuhn [1962] 1970a: 162, had asked: Does a field make\nprogress because it is a science, or is it a science because it makes\nprogress?\u201d) The underlying question is whether rationality is\nbasic and fundamental rather than derivative to something else. Those\nlike Laudan who make it derivative need to defend their position\nagainst the objection that they are committing a verificationist\nfallacy of confusing rationality itself (its constitutive nature) with\nthe criteria for applying the term \u2018rational\u2019. Are\nmomentary success or longer-term progress constitutive of\nrationality or merely consequential indicators of it (or neither)?\n\nBe that as it may, since progress is a historical (history-laden)\nconcept, so is rationality on Laudan\u2019s conception, as it was on\nLakatos\u2019s. The temporality of his account led Laudan to\nintroduce an important distinction between acceptance of a\ntheory and pursuit that would explain how rational\ntransitions to a new research tradition are possible. Scientists\nshould accept the theory that, pro tem, has the greatest\noverall problem-solving success, but pursue the tradition that now\nenjoys a higher rate of success. Nearly everyone today\naccepts a distinction of this sort, although not necessarily\nLaudan\u2019s criteria of success.\n\nLike Structure and MSRP, Laudan\u2019s model of science\nreceived much discussion, both constructive and critical. It faced the\nusual difficulties of how we are to count and weigh the importance of\nproblems in order to have a viable accounting scheme. Historicists can\nreply that it is not their fault if this is a messy task, since that\nis just historical reality, a reality that, if anything, favors expert\njudgment over tidy decision algorithms.\n\nLaudan (1984) agreed with Kuhn that the goals, standards, and methods\nof science change historically as well as the theoretical and\nobservational claims, but his \u201creticulationist model\u201d\nrejected as historically inaccurate Kuhn\u2019s claim that sometimes they all\nchange together to constitute a (Kuhnian) revolution. Dramatic change in one\nplace need not seriously disturb fixity elsewhere and rarely or never does. Hence,\nincommensurability is a pseudo-problem. Moreover, Laudan contended, his\nreticulationist model overcomes the hierarchical problem that has led\nthinkers such as Poincar\u00e9 and Popper to make the goals of\nscience arbitrary (the top of the hierarchy and hence the unjustified\njustifier of what comes below), e.g., mere conventions. These authors have no\nway to rationally appraise the goals themselves, leaving their positions stuck\nwith an account of merely instrumental reason: efficiency relative to\na given, arbitrary goal. By contrast, in Laudan\u2019s model, the\nelements are mutually constraining, mutually adjusting, an idea\nprominent in Dewey\u2019s attack on hierarchy in his 1939. None takes\nabsolute precedence over the others. Thus, some goals are irrational\nbecause present and foreseeable knowledge and methods have no way to\nachieve them or to measure progress toward them. (Laudan thereby\nrejected strong realist goals as irrational.) An advance in substantive\nor methodological expertise can make it rational to embrace new\nstandards and also new goals.\n\nThe debate between Laudan and Worrall over the value of a fixed\nmethodology of science wonderfully exemplifies the persistence of the\nancient problem of change (Laudan 1989; Worrall 1989). How is it\npossible to explain, or even to measure, change except in terms of an\nunderlying fixity? Doesn\u2019t allowing change at all three of\nLaudan\u2019s levels\u2014matters of scientific fact and theory,\nmethod and standards, and goals\u2014leave us with a damaging\nrelativism? Worrall defends the fixity of Lakatos\u2019s MSRP but\nagrees that it cannot be established a priori. Laudan\u2019s\nreticulated model retains a more piecemeal and historically contingent fixity, as described\nabove.\n With all that said, the threat of relativism remains, for how can\na good, non-whiggish historicist have a trans-historical measure of\nprogress? Laudan\u2019s answer was that we can whiggishly measure\nscientific progress by our own standards, regardless of what the goals\nof the historical investigators were. This sounds right about what we\ndo. But if the reasons why the historical scientists in the trenches\nmade the decisions they did do not really matter to us (or to any\ngiven generation), retrospectively, then how is rationality providing\na methodological guide or causal explanation why historical scientists\nmade the decisions they did?  Their individual rationality would seem\nto become irrelevant. And why, then, is rationality the central\nproblem of philosophy of science?\n\nDeparting sharply from traditional, non-naturalistic treatments of\nnorms, Laudan addressed the is-ought problem head-on by advancing an\nimportant and influential, pragmatic \u201cnormative\nnaturalism\u201d whereby the acceptable norms are those best\nsupported by successful historical practice\u2014where, again,\nsuccess is as we judge it today. On this view, norms have empirical\ncontent. They are winnowed from the history of successful practice,\nagain a broadly Deweyan idea (e.g., Dewey 1929). At Virginia Tech\nLaudan and colleagues initiated a program to test the individual norms\npresent in various philosophical models of science against the history\nof science (Laudan 1977: 7; Donovan et al. 1988). Like every major\nphilosophical proposal, this one came under critical fire, in this\ncase, e.g., for isolating individual methodological rules from their\nhistorical contexts and for reverting to a traditional, positivistic,\nhypothetico-deductive model of testing. In short, critics complained\nthat Laudan\u2019s metatheory of rationality did not match his\nfirst-order, problem-solving-progress theory of rationality. And\nprofessional historians did not welcome this invitation to\ncooperation, since the project implied a division of labor that\nregarded philosophers as the theoreticians proposing rules to test,\nwhile the historians were relegated to fact-grubbing handmaidens doing\nthe testing. To be fair, as a historicist philosopher, Laudan himself\nhad done a good deal of historical work.\n\nOn another front, Laudan\u2019s (1981) attempt to\n\u201cconfute\u201d scientific realism on the basis of historical\nexamples of major scientific change stimulated much discussion, since\nthe status of realism had become a central issue in philosophy of\nscience. Indeed, Laudan\u2019s article helped to make it so.\n",
