    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nLater Muslim medieval historians say that Ab\u00fb H\u00e2mid\nMuhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee was born in 1058 or 1059\nin Tabar\u00e2n-T\u00fbs (15 miles north of modern Meshed, NE Iran),\nyet notes about his age in his letters and his autobiography indicate\nthat he was born in 1055 or 1056 (Griffel 2009, 23\u201325).\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee received his early education in his hometown of\nTus together with his brother Ahmad (c.1060\u20131123 or\n1126) who became a famous preacher and Sufi scholar. Muhammad went on\nto study with the influential Ash\u2019arite theologian\nal-Juwayn\u00ee (1028\u201385) at the Niz\u00e2miyya Madrasa in\nnearby Nishapur. This brought him in close contact with the court of\nthe Grand-Seljuq Sultan Maliksh\u00e2h (reg. 1071\u201392) and his\ngrand-vizier Niz\u00e2m al-Mulk (1018\u201392). In 1091 Niz\u00e2m\nal-Mulk appointed al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee to the prestigious\nNiz\u00e2miyya Madrasa in Baghdad. In addition to being a confidante\nof the Seljuq Sultan and his court in Isfahan, he now became closely\nconnected to the caliphal court in Baghdad. He was undoubtedly the\nmost influential intellectual of his time, when in 1095 he suddenly\ngave up his posts in Baghdad and left the city. Under the influence of\nSufi literature al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee had begun to change his\nlifestyle two years before his departure (Griffel 2009, 67). He\nrealized that the high ethical standards of a virtuous religious life\nare not compatible with being in the service of sultans, viziers, and\ncaliphs. Benefiting from the riches of the military and political\nelite implies complicity in their corrupt and oppressive rule and will\njeopardize one\u2019s prospect of redemption in the afterlife. When\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee left Baghdad in 1095 he went to Damascus and\nJerusalem and vowed at the tomb of Abraham in Hebron never again to\nserve the political authorities or teach at state-sponsored schools.\nHe continued to teach, however, at small schools (singl.\nz\u00e2wiya) that were financed by private donations. After\nperforming the pilgrimage in 1096, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee returned via\nDamascus and Baghdad to his hometown T\u00fbs, where he founded a\nsmall private school and a Sufi convent\n(kh\u00e2nq\u00e2h). In 1106, at the beginning of the 6th\ncentury in the Muslim calendar, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee broke his vow\nand returned to teaching at the state-sponsored Niz\u00e2miyya\nMadrasa in Nishapur, where he himself had been a student. To his\nfollowers he justified this step with the great amount of theological\nconfusion among the general public and pressure from authorities at\nthe Seljuq court (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1959a, 45\u201350 = 2000b,\n87\u201393). Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee regarded himself as one of the\nrenewers (singl. muhy\u00ee) of religion, who, according to\na had\u00eeth, will come every new century. In Nishapur,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s teaching activity at the\nNiz\u00e2miyya madrasa led to a controversy that was triggered by\nopposition to his teachings, particularly those in his most widely\nread work, The Revival of the Religious Sciences, and by\naccusations that these show a distinct influence from\nfalsafa. Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee was summoned to defend\nhimself in front of the Seljuq governor Sanjar (d. 1157). The latter,\nhowever, acquitted him from all charges and supported his teaching\nactivity in Nishapur (Garden 2014: 143\u2013168). On this occasion,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee again asked to be released from his obligations\nat the Niz\u00e2miyya madrasa, a request that was denied. All this\ntime, he continued to teach at his z\u00e2wiya in T\u00fbs\nwhere he died in December 1111 (Griffel 2009, 20\u201359).\n",
