    "main_text": "Motivation\n2. Motivation\n\nDeductivism is interesting and important for a host of reasons. The\nfirst is that it gives proof, indisputably of paramount importance in\nmathematics, pride of place. Mathematicians take a result to be\nestablished only if it has been proved. It is natural to explore what\nhappens if we take this one step further and take mathematical truth\nto be, not just established, but constituted, by the\nexistence of a (possibly not yet known) proof.\n\nSecond, many mathematicians profess to believe in deductivism or\nsomething like it (Maddy 2022: 9). Ask mathematicians what their\nsubject is about and at least some will reply that it is about\n\u201cwhat can be deduced from the axioms\u201d. Naturally, a slogan\nlike this is not a worked-out philosophy, and is more often\nencountered in conversation than in print. Still, if the slogan and\nthe sentiment behind it point to any specific philosophy, surely it is\nto deductivism. Moreover, most parts of mathematics are explicitly\nunderstood as exploring consequences of stipulated\n axioms,[1]\n which deductivism spells out in its own way and generalises to all\nmathematics. Not only that, but as\n \u00a73\n will briefly document, many influential philosophers of mathematics\nfrom the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century were, or could\nbe interpreted as, deductivists.\n\nThird, and this might go some way towards explaining the second point,\ndeductivism is seen as philosophically \u201cclean\u201d (Rheinwald\n1984: 49) or a way to \u201cavoid philosophical quicksand\u201d\n(Maddy 2022: 9). On the epistemological side, the deductivist\u2019s\nmain task is to account for the epistemology of deductive\nlogic\u2014there is no further specific problem of mathematical\nepistemology. On the metaphysical side, the deductivist construal\nappears not to presuppose any abstract mathematical objects, often\nseen as problematic. A further point in deductivism\u2019s favour is\nthat it respects the presumed objectivity of mathematics, because what\nfollows from the axioms is an objective matter, independent of us.\nMoreover, deductivism seems to offer a promising account of\napplications: whenever you find a physical system that satisfies the\naxioms of a particular branch of mathematics, the branch\u2019s\ntheorems must apply to the system. (We shall return to these alleged\nattractions below.)\n\nThe fourth and final reason is that deductivism and structuralism are\nrelated. Indeed, deductivism is seen by some (e.g., Bostock 2009: 183)\nas a syntactic version of eliminative structuralism. And\nstructuralism, in its various guises, and its various problems\nnotwithstanding, is one of the most attractive metaphysics of\nmathematics on the market\n today.[2]\n\nDeductivism and eliminative structuralism share some general features.\nRoughly speaking, both understand a mathematical claim \\(p\\) as\n\u201cthe axioms imply that \\(p\\)\u201d (where \u201cthe\naxioms\u201d may be understood as those of the germane branch of\nmathematics or otherwise\u2014for different versions of deductivism,\nsee\n \u00a74).\n Deductivism understands the relevant implication deductively,\neliminative structuralism semantically. For deductivists, the relevant\nnotion of implication or consequence is the syntactic one which in\nlogic is denoted by \u201c\\(\\vdash\\)\u201d; to say that \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash \\delta\\) is to say that the sentence \\(\\delta\\) is derivable\nfrom \\(\\Gamma\\) in some specified deductive system. For eliminative\nstructuralists, the relevant notion of implication or consequence is\ninstead the semantic one which in logic is denoted by\n\u201c\\(\\vDash\\)\u201d. Eliminative structuralists, for example,\nconstrue \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d as a claim about what holds in\nany structure in which the axioms of arithmetic are\n satisfied.[3]\n\nWhen we dig down into the details, however, some clear differences\nemerge. Deductivists take mathematical claims to be about sentences,\nwhereas eliminative structuralists take them to be generalisations\nover structures. Unlike deductivists, eliminative structuralists\ntherefore owe us an account of the metaphysics of structures.\nEliminative structuralists also usually couple their account with the\nexistential assertion that a structure of the right kind exists (or\ncould exist), whereas deductivists often omit the corresponding claim\nthat the axioms are consistent. One well-known version of eliminative\nstructuralism, first articulated by Putnam (1967b) and developed by\nHellman (1989), is modal, whereas deductivism is usually not modal.\n(Although see\n \u00a75\n for how to spell out deductivism in terms of a primitive modal\noperator.) Finally, eliminative structuralism is but one of the many\nforms of structuralism around today. Some, such as Hellman\u2019s\nversion, have much in common with the eliminative variety closest to\ndeductivism; others, such as Shapiro\u2019s ante rem structuralism\n(Shapiro 1997), less so.\n\nStill, despite these differences, there are some clear historical and\nphilosophical continuities between the two, so that getting clear\nabout deductivism\u2019s flaws can help us better appreciate the\nvirtues of a broadly structuralist approach. What is certainly true is\nthat prior to G\u00f6del\u2019s 1929 Completeness Theorem for\nfirst-order logic (published as a paper the following year), the\ndifferences between deductivism and eliminative structuralism were not\nclearly understood. This point will be illustrated in the historical\n \u00a73.\n Also relevant to the story is G\u00f6del\u2019s 1931 First\nIncompleteness Theorem, which will form the basis of a key objection\nto deductivism in\n \u00a79.[4]\n\nA final point of connection is that, when the background logic is\naxiomatizable, eliminative structuralism and deductivism offer an\nextensionally equivalent account of mathematical\n truth.[5]\n The simple reason is that, for an axiomatizable logic, such as\nfirst-order logic, semantic implication is extensionally equivalent to\ndeductive inference. So suppose you are tempted by eliminative\nstructuralism in the philosophy of mathematics and use first-order\nlogic as your default\n logic.[6]\n You will then take \\(p\\) to be a mathematical truth exactly when a\n(first-order) deductivist does. Avoiding a \u201clapse into a\nsemantic equivalent of deductivism\u201d was precisely one of the\nreasons Hellman chose a second-order framework for his modal version\nof eliminative structuralism (Hellman 1989: 18\u201319). As\nexplained, however, eliminative structuralism and deductivism are not\nequivalent in any stronger sense than this extensional one, even when\ntheir shared background logic is axiomatisable.\n\nA terminological note: deductivism is sometimes called\n\u201cif-thenism\u201d. However, \u201cif-thenism\u201d sounds\nmore like the genus whose syntactic and semantic species are\ndeductivism and eliminative structuralism respectively. Rheinwald\n(1984: 49) uses the name \u201cimplicationism\u201d for the genus,\nreserving \u201csyntactic implicationism\u201d for deductivism and\n\u201csemantic implicationism\u201d for structuralism. This\nterminology manages to cover both genus and species and also has the\ngreat merit of transparency. The present entry sticks to\n\u201cdeductivism\u201d and \u201cstructuralism\u201d for the two\nspecies, because these names are the more usual ones today (and are\nshorter).\n",
