    "main_text": "Autonomy\n10. Autonomy\n\nAt the heart of Kant\u2019s moral theory is the idea of autonomy.\nMost readers interpret Kant as holding that autonomy is a property of\nrational wills or agents. Understanding the idea of autonomy was, in\nKant\u2019s view, key to understanding and justifying the authority\nthat moral requirements have over us. As with Rousseau, whose views\ninfluenced Kant, freedom does not consist in being bound by no law,\nbut by laws that are in some sense of one\u2019s own making. The idea\nof freedom as autonomy thus goes beyond the merely\n\u201cnegative\u201d sense of being free from causes on our\nconduct originating outside of ourselves. It contains first and\nforemost the idea of laws made and laid down by oneself, and, in\nvirtue of this, laws that have decisive authority over oneself.\n\nKant\u2019s basic idea can be grasped intuitively by analogy with the\nidea of political freedom as autonomy (See Reath 1994). Consider how\npolitical freedom in liberal theories is thought to be related to\nlegitimate political authority: A state is free when its citizens are\nbound only by laws in some sense of their own making \u2014 created\nand put into effect, say, by vote or by elected representatives. The\nlaws of that state then express the will of the citizens who are bound\nby them. The idea, then, is that the source of legitimate political\nauthority is not external to its citizens, but internal to them,\ninternal to \u201cthe will of the people.\u201d It is because the\nbody politic created and enacted these laws for itself that it can be\nbound by them. An autonomous state is thus one in which the authority\nof its laws is in the will of the people in that state, rather than in\nthe will of a people external to that state, as when one state imposes\nlaws on another during occupation or colonization. In the latter case,\nthe laws have no legitimate authority over those citizens. In a\nsimilar fashion, we may think of a person as free when bound only by\nher own will and not by the will of another. Her actions then express\nher own will and not the will of someone or something else. The\nauthority of the principles binding her will is then also not external\nto her will. It comes from the fact that she willed them. So autonomy,\nwhen applied to an individual, ensures that the source of the\nauthority of the principles that bind her is in her own will.\nKant\u2019s view can be seen as the view that the moral law is just\nsuch a principle. Hence, the \u201cmoral legitimacy\u201d of the CI\nis grounded in its being an expression of each person\u2019s own\nrational will. It is because each person\u2019s own reason is the\nlegislator and executor of the moral law that it is authoritative for\nher. (For a contrasting interpretation of autonomy that emphasizes the\nintrinsic value of freedom of choice and the instrumental role of\nreason in preserving that value, see Guyer 2007).\n\nKant argues that the idea of an autonomous will emerges from a\nconsideration of the idea of a will that is free \u201cin a negative\nsense.\u201d The concept of a rational will is of a will that\noperates by responding to what it takes to be reasons. This is,\nfirstly, the concept of a will that does not operate through the\ninfluence of factors outside of this responsiveness to apparent\nreasons. For a will to be free is thus for it to be physically and\npsychologically unforced in its operation. Hence, behaviors that are\nperformed because of obsessions or thought disorders are not free in\nthis negative sense. But also, for Kant, a will that operates by being\ndetermined through the operation of natural laws, such as those of\nbiology or psychology, cannot be thought of as operating by responding\nto reasons. Hence, determination by natural laws is conceptually\nincompatible with being free in a negative sense.\n\nA crucial move in Kant\u2019s argument is his claim that a rational\nwill cannot act except \u201cunder the Idea\u201d of its own freedom\n(G 4:448). The expression \u201cacting under the Idea of\nfreedom\u201d is easy to misunderstand. It does not mean that a\nrational will must believe it is free, since determinists are\nas free as libertarians in Kant\u2019s view. Indeed, Kant goes out of\nhis way in his most famous work, the Critique of Pure Reason,\nto argue that we have no rational basis for believing our\nwills to be free. This would involve, he argues, attributing a\nproperty to our wills that they would have to have as \u2018things in\nthemselves\u2019 apart from the causally determined world of\nappearances. Of such things, he insists, we can have no knowledge. For\nmuch the same reason, Kant is not claiming that a rational will cannot\noperate without feeling free. Feelings, even the feeling of\noperating freely or the \u201clooseness\u201d Hume refers to when we\nact, cannot be used in an a priori argument to establish the\nCI, since they are empirical data.\n\nOne helpful way to understand acting \u201cunder the Idea of\nfreedom\u201d is by analogy with acting \u201cunder the Idea\u201d\nthat there are purposes in nature: Although there is, according to\nKant, no rational basis for the belief that the natural world is (or\nis not) arranged according to some purpose by a Designer, the actual\npractices of science often require looking for the purpose of this or\nthat chemical, organ, creature, environment, and so on. Thus, one\nengages in these natural sciences by searching for purposes in nature.\nYet when an evolutionary biologist, for instance, looks for the\npurpose of some organ in some creature, she does not after all thereby\nbelieve that the creature was designed that way, for\ninstance, by a Deity. Nor is she having some feeling of\n\u201cdesignedness\u201d in the creature. To say that she\n\u201cacts under the Idea of\u201d design is to say something about\nthe practice of biology: Practicing biology involves searching for the\npurposes of the parts of living organisms. In much the same way,\nalthough there is no rational justification for the belief that our\nwills are (or are not) free, the actual practice of practical\ndeliberation and decision consists of a search for the right causal\nchain of which to be the origin \u2014 consists, that is, seeking to\nbe the first causes of things, wholly and completely through the\nexercise of one\u2019s own will.\n\nKant says that a will that cannot exercise itself except under the\nIdea of its freedom is free from a practical point of view\n(im practischer Absicht). In saying such wills are free from\na practical point of view, he is saying that in engaging in practical\nendeavors \u2014 trying to decide what to do, what to hold oneself\nand others responsible for, and so on \u2014 one is justified in\nholding oneself to all of the principles to which one would be\njustified in holding wills that are autonomous free wills. Thus, once\nwe have established the set of prescriptions, rules, laws and\ndirectives that would bind an autonomous free will, we then hold\nourselves to this very same of set prescriptions, rules, laws and\ndirectives. And one is justified in this because rational agency can\nonly operate by seeking to be the first cause of its actions, and\nthese are the prescriptions, and so on, of being a first cause of\naction. Therefore, rational agents are free in a negative sense\ninsofar as any practical matter is at issue.\n\nCrucially, rational wills that are negatively free must be autonomous,\nor so Kant argues. This is because the will is a kind of\ncause\u2014willing causes action. Kant took from Hume the idea that\ncausation implies universal regularities: if x causes\ny, then there is some universally valid law connecting\nXs to Ys. So, if my will is the cause of my\n\u03c6ing, then \u03a6ing is connected to the sort of willing I engage\nin by some universal law. But it can\u2019t be a natural law, such as\na psychological, physical, chemical or biological law. These laws,\nwhich Kant thought were universal too, govern the movements of my\nbody, the workings of my brain and nervous system and the operation of\nmy environment and its effects on me as a material being. But they\ncannot be the laws governing the operation of my will; that, Kant\nalready argued, is inconsistent with the freedom of my will in a\nnegative sense. So, the will operates according to a universal law,\nthough not one authored by nature, but one of which I am the origin or\nauthor. And that is to say that, in viewing my willing to \u03c6 as a\nnegatively free cause of my \u03c6ing, I must view my will as the\nautonomous cause of my having \u03c6ed, as causing my having \u03c6ed by\nway of some law that I, insofar as I am a rational will, laid down for\nmy will.\n\nThus, Kant argues, a rational will, insofar as it is rational, is a\nwill conforming itself to those laws valid for any rational will.\nAddressed to imperfectly rational wills, such as our own, this becomes\nan imperative: \u201cConform your action to a universal non-natural\nlaw.\u201d Kant assumed that there was some connection between this\nformal requirement and the formulation of the CI which enjoins us to\n\u201cAct as though the maxim of your action were to become by your\nwill a universal law of nature.\u201d But, as commentators have long\nnoticed (see, e.g. , Hill, 1989a, 1989b), it is not clear what the\nlink is between the claim that rational autonomous wills conform\nthemselves to whatever universally valid laws require, and the more\nsubstantial and controversial claim that you should evaluate your\nmaxims in the ways implied by the universal law of nature\nformulation.\n\nKant appeared not to recognize the gap between the law of an\nautonomous rational will and the CI, but he was apparently unsatisfied\nwith the argument establishing the CI in Groundwork III for\nanother reason, namely, the fact that it does not prove that we really\nare free. In the Critique of Practical Reason, he states that\nit is simply a \u201cfact of reason\u201d (Factum der\nVernunft) that our wills are bound by the CI, and he uses this to\nargue that our wills are autonomous. Hence, while in the\nGroundwork Kant relies on a dubious argument for our autonomy\nto establish that we are bound by the moral law, in the second\nCritique, he argues from the bold assertion of our being\nbound by the moral law to our autonomy.\n\nThe apparent failure of Kant\u2019s argument to establish the\nautonomy of the will, and hence the authority of moral demands over\nus, has not deterred his followers from trying to make good on this\nproject. One strategy favored recently has been to turn back to the\narguments of Groundwork II for help. Kant himself repeatedly\nclaimed that these arguments are merely analytic but that they do not\nestablish that there is anything that answers to the concepts he\nanalyzes. The conclusions are thus fully compatible with morality\nbeing, as he puts it, a \u201cmere phantom of the brain\u201d (G\n4:445). Kant clearly takes himself to have established that rational\nagents such as ourselves must take the means to our ends, since this\nis analytic of rational agency. But there is a chasm between this\nanalytic claim and the supposed synthetic conclusion that rational\nagency also requires conforming to a further, non-desire based,\nprinciple of practical reason such as the CI. Nevertheless, some see\narguments in Groundwork II that establish just this. These\nstrategies involve a new \u201cteleological\u201d reading of\nKant\u2019s ethics that relies on establishing the existence of an\nabsolute value or an \u201cend in itself\u201d (we say more about\nthis teleological reading below). They begin with Kant\u2019s own\nstated assumption that there is such an end in itself if and only if\nthere is a categorical imperative binding on all rational agents as\nsuch. If this assumption is true, then if one can on independent\ngrounds prove that there is something which is an end in itself, one\nwill have an argument for a categorical imperative. One such strategy,\nfavored by Korsgaard (1996) and Wood (1999) relies on the apparent\nargument Kant gives that humanity is an end in itself. Guyer, by\ncontrast, sees an argument for freedom as an end in itself (Guyer\n2000). Both strategies have faced textual and philosophical hurdles.\nConsiderable interpretive finesse, for instance, is required to\nexplain Kant\u2019s stark insistence on the priority of principles\nand law over the good in the second Critique (CPrR\n5:57\u201367)\n\nAlthough most of Kant\u2019s readers understand the property of\nautonomy as being a property of rational wills, some, such as Thomas\nE. Hill, have held that Kant\u2019s central idea is that of autonomy\nis a property, not primarily of wills, but of principles. The core\nidea is that Kant believed that all moral theories prior to his own\nwent astray because they portrayed fundamental moral principles as\nappealing to the existing interests of those bound by them. By\ncontrast, in Kant\u2019s view moral principles must not appeal to\nsuch interests, for no interest is necessarily universal. Thus, in\nassuming at the outset that moral principles must embody some interest\n(or \u201cheteronomous\u201d principles), such theories rule out the\nvery possibility that morality is universally binding. By contrast,\nthe Categorical Imperative, because it does not enshrine existing\ninterests, presumes that rational agents can conform to a principle\nthat does not appeal to their interests (or an\n\u201cautonomous\u201d principle), and so can fully ground our\nconception, according to Kant, of what morality requires of us.\n\nA different interpretive strategy, which has gained prominence in\nrecent years, focuses on Kant\u2019s apparent identification, in\nGroundwork III, of the will and practical reason. One natural\nway of interpreting Kant\u2019s conception of freedom is to\nunderstand it in terms of the freedom and spontaneity of reason\nitself. This in turn apparently implies that our wills are necessarily\naimed at what is rational and reasonable. To will something, on this\npicture, is to govern oneself in accordance with reason. Often,\nhowever, we fail to effectively so govern ourselves because we are\nimperfect rational beings who are caused to act by our\nnon\u2013rational desires and inclinations. The result, at least on\none version of this interpretation (Wolff 1973), is that we either act\nrationally and reasonably (and so autonomously) or we are merely\ncaused to behave in certain ways by non\u2013rational forces acting\non us (and so heteronomously). This is, however, an implausible view.\nIt implies that all irrational acts, and hence all immoral acts, are\nnot willed and therefore not free. Most interpreters have denied that\nthis is the proper interpretation of Kant\u2019s views. However,\nseveral prominent commentators nonetheless think that there is some\ntruth in it (Engstrom 2009; Reath 2015; Korsgaard 1996, 2008, 2009).\nThey agree that we always act under the \u201cguise of the\ngood\u201d in the sense that our will is necessarily aimed at what is\nobjectively and subjectively rational and reasonable, but these\ninterpreters also think that, for Kant, there is a middle\u2013ground\nbetween perfect conformity to reason and being caused to act by\nnatural forces. In particular, when we act immorally, we are either\nweak\u2013willed or we are misusing our practical reason by willing\nbadly. We do not have the capacity to aim to act on an immoral maxim\nbecause the will is identified with practical reason, so when we will\nto perform an immoral act, we implicitly but mistakenly take our\nunderlying policy to be required by reason. By representing our\nimmoral act as rational and reasonable, we are not exercising our\npowers of reason well, so we are simply making a \u201cchoice\u201d\nthat is contrary to reason without \u201cwilling\u201d it as such.\nOur choice is nonetheless free and attributable to us because our will\nwas involved in leading us to take the act to be rational and\nreasonable. It remains to be seen whether, on this complicated\ninterpretation of Kant, it sufficiently allows for the possibility\nthat one can knowingly and willingly do wrong if the will is practical\nreason and practical reason is, in part, the moral law.\n",
