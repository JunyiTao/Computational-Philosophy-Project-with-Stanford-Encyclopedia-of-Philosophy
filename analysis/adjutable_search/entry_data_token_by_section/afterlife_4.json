    "main_text": "Parapsychology and Near-Death Experiences\n5. Metaphysical Considerations Concerning Survival\n\nLeaving aside such empirical evidence, what general metaphysical\nconsiderations are relevant to belief in survival? While some\nphilosophers have sought to marginalize metaphysics (see, for example,\nHadot 1995), such deflationary accounts have been found wanting by\nmany philosophers (see, for example, Wynn 2020). We have already seen\nthat a materialist account of persons creates some serious\nobstacles. As van Inwagen and others have argued, God could bring\nabout an afterlife for persons in a way consistent with a materialist\nphilosophy of mind. But in the absence of God, a materialist,\nnaturalist worldview seems not at all promising for survival. As noted\nearlier, mind-body dualism would offer some support for the\npossibility of survival but dualism by no means guarantees survival;\nthe old arguments from the simplicity and alleged indestructibility of\nsouls are out of favor. As Kant observed, a \u201csimple\u201d soul,\nwhich cannot be dissolved into its constituent parts, might still fade\naway gradually until it has completely disappeared. What often is not\nsufficiently appreciated, however, is the close tie between theism and\nbelief in an afterlife. The point is not merely that theistic\nreligions incorporate belief in an afterlife which many persons accept\nbecause of this religious context. The tie is closer than that, and it\nhas considerable force in both directions.\n\nSuppose, on the one hand, that the God of theism does in fact exist.\nAccording to theism, God is both all-powerful and perfectly good, and\nthis goodness is supposed to be of a sort that is relevant to the\nwelfare of human beings (and other rational creatures, if there are\nany). Indeed, this is not merely a speculative assumption; there are\nBiblical texts proclaiming that God is a God of love. If there is\nreason to believe that God loves created persons, then it is highly\nplausible to believe that God desires to provide creatures with the\nopportunity for a greater, and longer-lasting, fulfillment than is\npossible within the brief scope of earthly existence. This is\nespecially true, one would think, for those who, through no fault of\ntheir own, find their lives blighted by disease, or accident, or war,\nor any of the other natural or anthropogenic disasters to which we are\nvulnerable. And yet even those of us who enjoy relatively good and\nsatisfying lives are conscious of far, far more that could be\naccomplished and enjoyed, given more time and the vigor and energy to\nuse it well.\n\nThis argument can also be reversed to telling effect. If there is no\nafterlife, no realm in which the sorrows of this life can be assuaged\nand its injustices remedied, then it may be argued that the problem of\nevil becomes impossible to solve in any rationally intelligible way.\nArguably, a perfectly good and all-powerful God would not make a\ncosmos in which all or most created persons have lives that are full\nof misery and then are annihilated; nor would an all-loving good God\ncreate a cosmos in which there is no opportunity for transformation\nbeyond this life. That is not to say, of course, that allowing for an\nafterlife makes the problem of evil easy for theists\u2014that is far\nfrom being the case. But it does provide a way in which this\nlife\u2019s injustices can be seen as not having had the last\nword\u2014victims in this life do not have to be eternally victims\nand those who\u2019ve done evil won\u2019t get away with it. For\nthese reasons, one would be hard pressed to find very many theists (as\nopposed to deists) who do not also affirm belief in an afterlife.\n\nThe close connection between theism and an afterlife is affirmed in\nKant\u2019s arguments for the \u201cpostulates of practical\nreason\u201d. To be sure, Kant gives different reasons for\npostulating God and for postulating an afterlife, and the ends to be\nserved by these postulations are ostensibly different. In actuality,\nhowever, it is highly plausible that the two postulates are\ninseparable. We ought to postulate God, because only in this way is it\npossible that in the end happiness should be enjoyed by persons in\nproportion to their moral worthiness. Given the actual conditions of\nthe present life, it is evident that this end can be secured, if at\nall, only in a future existence. We are told to postulate immortality,\nbecause only an endless life makes possible continued progress towards\nthe goal of a coincidence of one\u2019s will with the requirements of\nthe moral law. But for such continued progress to be at all likely to\noccur would seem to require some kind of morally benign conditions in\nthe afterlife, and Kant implicitly assumes that such conditions will\nobtain.\n\nWhat about an argument in the opposite direction: if it is reasonable\nto believe in an afterlife, is it more reasonable to believe in\ntheism? Given the reasonability of believing in an afterlife, it would\nbe more reasonable to believe that theism is true rather than\nmaterialistic naturalism, but the reasonability of theism would have\nto be weighed in the context of non-theistic philosophies and\nreligions that include belief in an afterlife. Nontheistic Hinduism\nand Buddhism include beliefs about an afterlife; in these religious\ntraditions, belief in an afterlife is part of their understanding of\ncosmic justice, a system in which one\u2019s reincarnation (and,\nultimately, one\u2019s enlightenment and liberation) depends on\none\u2019s Karma. These, and other traditions such as Jainism,\ninvolve matters that are addressed in other entries in the SEP, but we\noffer here a modest observation on how the evidence for a good\nafterlife (an afterlife that is in accord with some morally sound\norder) might lend more support for one religion or philosophy than\nanother.\n\nImagine that we have good reason to believe (or we possess Kantian\njustification for faith) that the cosmos is ultimately ordered in a\njust and moral manner (felicity and virtue will be in concord, and the\nwicked will not flourish indefinitely and so on). Imagine further that\nwe can limit the most plausible accounts of such a moral order on the\nbasis of either traditional theistic accounts of the afterlife or a\nsystem of reincarnation in which Karma is at work determining\nsuccessive re-births until enlightenment\u2014liberation. Robin\nCollins has argued that the second alternative faces what he calls the\n\u201ckarma management problem\u201d. He writes,\n\n\nTraditionally Buddhists have believed that by and large the\ncircumstances of one\u2019s rebirth are determined by one\u2019s\nkarma\u2014that is, one\u2019s deeds, whether good or bad in this\nand previous lives. This, however, seems to require that there exist\nsomething like a \u201cprogram\u201d that arranges your genes, the\nfamily conditions you are born into, and the like to correspond to the\nmoral worth of your past deeds (Collins 1999: 206).\n\n\nFor theists, such as many (but not all) Hindus, this minute\narrangement of one\u2019s life circumstances to match one\u2019s\nkarma can be viewed as the work of God. So long as we recognize the\nintelligibility of divine agency, the \u201cmanagement\u201d of\nreincarnation should in principle be no more difficult to accept than\nany other theistic explanations. But in the absence of theistic,\nintentional explanations, how would a \u201ckarma program\u201d\nwork, and how was it initiated? We know today, by means that were not\navailable to the ancient Hindus and Buddhists, that\n\u201cnature\u201d\u2014the nature that is known and studied in the\nnatural sciences\u2014simply doesn\u2019t work this way. The laws of\nnature are subtle and marvelously complex (though also, in their own\nway, \u201csimple\u201d), but it is abundantly clear that they do\nnot work in such a way as to determine physical situations in\naccordance with the moral worth of persons, or in accordance with any\nmoral considerations whatsoever. The laws of nature, we might say, are\nno respecters of persons\u2014or of morality. Rather, they are\nimpersonal in character, and in many cases are expressible in\nmathematical formulae that are far removed from the teleology that\npermeates human existence. So if there is a \u201ckarmic moral\norder\u201d of the sort postulated by the Indian traditions, it must\nbe something radically different from the order of nature that (so far\nas science can discern) governs the physical processes of the world.\nAnd yet the two orders must be intimately related, for it is precisely\nthese physical processes which, in the end, are said to be disposed in\naccordance with one\u2019s karma. It is wholly implausible that two\ndiverse systems of cosmic order such as this should arise from\nunrelated sources and come together accidentally; they must, then,\nhave a common source. If the common source of the natural order and\nthe karmic order is impersonal, we are still in need of some account\nof how and why it would be such as to produce these two quite\ndifferent sorts of order in the cosmos. These questions, it would\nseem, are much more readily answered if we postulate a\npersonal source of both the natural and the moral\norder\u2014that is to say, a God who desired that there be created\npersons, and who wished to provide a stable natural order within which\nthey could live and exercise their varied powers.\n\nThis is of course a mere sketch of an argument that would require much\nmore space for its full development. We offer the above line of\nreasoning as an example of how one might compare the merits of\nalternative accounts of an afterlife. It is also offered to make the\npoint that the case for or against an afterlife is best understood in\nlight of one\u2019s overall metaphysics. To see further how\nphilosophical reflection on an afterlife might be guided by\nmetaphysical considerations, consider briefly what has been called the\nargument from desire. Without question, many persons strongly desire\nthat there should be an afterlife and believe in one largely if not\nentirely for that reason. It is also beyond question that most\nphilosophers would regard this as a classic case of wishful thinking.\nBut this conclusion is too hasty; indeed, it commits the fallacy of\nbegging the question. To be sure, if the universe is naturalistic,\nthen the desire that many persons have for an afterlife does not\nconstitute any kind of evidence that an afterlife exists. One might\ninquire about the causes of such a desire and, given its widespread\noccurrence, might wonder about its possible Darwinian survival value.\nBut no evidential weight would attach to the desire on the assumption\nof naturalism.\n\nSuppose, on the other hand, that theism (or some view close to theism)\nis true. On this supposition, human life is not the accidental product\nof mindless forces that have operated with no thought to it or to\nanything else. On the contrary, human life (and the life of other\nrational creatures, if there are any) is the product of an\nevolutionary process, which was itself designed to produce such\nbeings, by a God who loves them and cares for them. If this is so,\nthen there is a strong case to be made that desires which are\nuniversal, or near-universal, among human beings are desires for which\nsatisfaction is possible. The inference does not amount to a\ncertainty; it is possible that humans have distorted God\u2019s\npurpose for them, and certainly human conceptions of the way in which\ncertain desires could be satisfied may be wide of the mark. But the\npresumption must be that desires that are widespread or universal are\naimed at some genuine and attainable good, however inadequate the\nconceptions of that good held by many individuals may be. And if this\nis so, persons who take the desire for an afterlife as a reason to\nbelieve in one are on the side of right reason in doing so. Only if\none assumes from the outset that the universe is not human-friendly\ncan the charge of wishful thinking be sustained. In a recent\ncontribution, Johan Eddebo (2017) argues that because we do not know\nthat we are not in a human-friendly universe we cannot rationally rule\nout the possibility of an afterlife for human persons. \n\nA great many persons who believe in life after death do so because of\nreasons that are internal to their own religious traditions. Hindus\nand Buddhists have their accounts of persons who remember in detail\nevents of their previous lives. Jews will rely on the visions of\nEzekiel and the traditions of the rabbis; Muslims on the prophecies of\nthe Koran. Christians will think of the resurrection of Jesus. Whether\nany of these appeals has serious evidentiary force is a question that\ncannot be pursued within the scope of this article; they must all the\nsame be included in any overall assessment of the rationality of\nbelief in an afterlife. Some recent philosophical work on the\nafterlife takes up issues that go beyond this entry. For example, if\nthere is a heaven would persons (souls) have free will? Would they\nhave lives that are dynamic (subject to change) or static or\nchangeless? What might individual cognition be like in paradise? Would\nthere be suffering in paradise? Given the basic teachings of the\nAbrahamic faiths, is there reason to believe that some nonhuman\nanimals enjoy an afterlife?
