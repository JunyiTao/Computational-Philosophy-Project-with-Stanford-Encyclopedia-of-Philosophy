    "main_text": "\n\n\nArcesilaus (315/4\u2013241/40 BCE) was a member and later leader of\nPlato\u2019s Academy. He initiated the skeptical phase of the Platonic\nschool (\u2018Academic skepticism\u2019) and was an influential\ncritic of the Stoics, especially of their epistemology.\n\n\nThe ancient evidence about Arcesilaus\u2019 philosophy is difficult\nto evaluate and, in some respects, inconsistent. As a result, scholars\ninterpret his skepticism in several ways. Some see his philosophical\nactivity as entirely negative or destructive of all views. Others take\nhim to have held positive views, but not on any philosophical topic,\nincluding the possibility of knowledge. Some regard him as having\nsupposed on the basis of arguments that nothing could be known, while\nstill others view him as someone who refused to accept any\nphilosophical theory or proposition as rationally warranted, insisting\nthat further examination is always required.\n",
