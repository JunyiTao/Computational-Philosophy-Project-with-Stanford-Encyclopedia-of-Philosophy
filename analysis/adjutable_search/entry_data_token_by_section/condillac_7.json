    "main_text": "Commerce and Government\n9. Commerce and Government\n\nIn the Treatise of Sensations, Condillac said that \u201cThe\nwords \u2018goodness\u2019 and \u2018beauty\u2019 express the\nproperties through which things contribute to our pleasure. As a\nresult, every sentient being has ideas of goodness and of beauties\nrelative to himself\u201d (Treatise IV.iii.1). He further\nsaid that \u201cthe good and the beautiful are not at all absolute: they\nare relative to the nature of the man who judges them and to his\nmakeup\u201d (Treatise, IV.iii.3). He clarified in a footnote\nthat he was not referring to goodness and beauty in themselves but\nabout the judgments that a man, who lives alone (as the statue of the\nTreatise of Sensations), may make of them: not everything\nthat such a man judges as good will be morally good, nor everything he\njudges beautiful will be really beautiful. Indeed we have seen that\nCondillac thought that people in society could come to an agreement\nabout moral laws and that these should be taken as objectively valid.\nAt the same time, Condillac insisted on a certain degree of relativity\nin the estimation of goods and evils. The human stage of development\nis characterized by a multiplication of needs, and it appears that\nthis by itself would allow for a variety in preferences, given the\ndifferent conditions of people. Humans are the first creatures that\ncan turn self-love in a proper desire for self-preservation, since\nanimals cannot have the notion of death. But humans may conceive of a\nvariety of ways of satisfying the same material needs. Moreover, their\nneeds multiply well beyond the mere material sphere of\nself-preservation. To describe this potentially unlimited development\nof needs, Condillac went as far as to say that even if humans were\nable to satisfy all their needs they would still be unable to satisfy\ntheir most pressing need, which is the need to desire (Treatise of\nAnimals II.8).\n\nIn one of his later works, Commerce and Government (1776),\nCondillac considered what he took to be some of the economic and\npolitical implications of his views. The book was published three\nmonths before Adam Smith\u2019s Wealth of Nations, and it is\nrightly considered a milestone in the tradition of\nlaissez-faire economics and classical liberalism.\n\nCondillac began with an examination of economic value, which he\nthought was determined by the utility and relative scarcity of a good\n(Commerce and Government I.1). Since people in different\nsituations of life estimate goods differently, social cooperation\nbased on the division of labour becomes possible through the market.\nAs Condillac said, thus anticipating by one century the insights of\nmarginalists, in every voluntary market transaction each party gives\nwhat he or she values less in exchange for what he or she values more\n(Commerce and Government I.6). It follows that every free\nexchange is to the mutual benefit of both parties. Condillac justified\nproperty rights in a Lockian fashion by original occupation,\nappropriation by labour, or voluntary transfer (Commerce and\nGovernment I.12). The government\u2019s main task is to maintain the\norder of society both internally and externally (Commerce and\nGovernment I.10), but the welfare of citizens is better\nguaranteed by the removal of barriers to free enterprise and free\ntrade, as Condillac argued at length in the second part of the work.\nGovernment\u2019s various \u201cblows\u201d against the freedom of\ncommerce, such as taxes on consumption, monopolies, cartels, trade\nbarriers, price controls, currency manipulations, public debt, and\nwars, only benefit a few privileged people who are politically\nconnected. Economic interventionism leads to an unhealthy and\n\u201cexcessive\u201d multiplication of needs in the group of people\nprivileged by these measures. This multiplication of needs is\nmanifested by the rise in the consumption of luxury products\n(Commerce and Government I.27, preface to Part II, II.16).\n(This unhealthy and excessive multiplication of needs, manifested by a\ntaste for luxury, should be contrasted with the healthy development of\nneeds that characterizes the rise of humans above the mere level of\nanimal economy described by Condillac in the Treatise of\nAnimals.) On the other hand, economic interventionism pushes back\nthe majority into a sort of animal economy, where they are constantly\nthreatened by poverty and starvation. Thus, policies of economic\nintervention exacerbate social inequalities. The equilibrating\nmechanism of the market would mitigate inequalities by lowering the\nprices of goods thanks to open competition among entrepreneurs\n(Commerce and Government II.1). Whatever inequalities remain\nin a free market society would just reflect a difference in talents\nand would rather be to the benefit of all. Certainly, the desire for\nhuman welfare cannot legitimately justify measures such as price\ncontrols on goods of first necessity such as wheat. These measures are\nnot only unjust but also turn out to be counterproductive,\nnotwithstanding the best intentions of advocates of restrictions on\nprivate property rights: \u201cThe rights of humanity opposed to those of\nproperty! What gibberish!\u201d (Commerce and Government\nII.15)\n",
