    "main_text": "Life and Career\n1. Life and Career\n\n\nMoore grew up in South London (his eldest brother was the poet T.\nSturge Moore who worked as an illustrator with W. B. Yeats). In 1892 he\nwent to Trinity College Cambridge to study Classics. He soon made the\nacquaintance there of Bertrand Russell who was two years ahead of him\nand of J. M. E. McTaggart who was then a charismatic young Philosophy\nFellow of Trinity College. Under their encouragement Moore decided to\nadd the study of Philosophy to his study of Classics, and he graduated\nin 1896 with a First Class degree in the subject. At this point he\nturned his energies towards attempting to follow in the footsteps of\nMcTaggart and Russell by winning a \u2018Prize\u2019 Fellowship at\nTrinity College which would enable him to continue the study of\nphilosophy there. In 1898 he was successful and over the next six years\nhe matured as a dynamic young philosopher, actually leading Russell\naway from the idealist philosophy of McTaggart and others which was\nthen dominant in Britain.\n\n\nMoore's Fellowship ended in 1904; after a spell away from Cambridge,\nMoore returned there in 1911 to a lectureship in the University and he\nthen lived there for the rest of his life (apart from an extended visit\nto the U.S.A. in 1940-44). In 1921 he became editor of Mind,\nthe leading British philosophical journal, and in 1925 he became a\nProfessor at Cambridge. These two appointments confirmed his position\nas the most highly respected British philosopher of the time, and with\nWittgenstein back in Cambridge after 1929, Cambridge became the most\nimportant centre of philosophy in the world. Moore retired as Professor\nin 1939 (to be succeeded by Wittgenstein) and as editor of\nMind in 1944; these retirements marked not only the end of his\npre-eminence, but also of the golden age of Cambridge philosophy.\n\n\nEarly in his time in Cambridge Moore became friends with some of the\nyoung men who went on to form the \u2018Bloomsbury Group\u2019, such\nas Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf and Maynard Keynes. Through these\nfriendships Moore exerted an indirect influence on British\ntwentieth-century culture as profound as that of any more\n\u2018engaged\u2019 philosopher. These long-lasting friendships bear\nwitness to Moore's Socratic personality and thus to a side of his\ncharacter which his writings do not convey. Gilbert Ryle, the Oxford\nphilosopher who was Moore's successor both as editor of Mind\nand as the dominant British philosopher after 1945, emphasized this\nside of Moore's personality:\nHe gave us courage not by making concessions, but by making\nno concessions to our youth or our shyness. He treated us as corrigible\nand therefore as responsible thinkers. He would explode at our mistakes\nand muddles with just that genial ferocity with which he would explode\nat the mistakes and muddles of philosophical high-ups, and with just\nthe genial ferocity with which he would explode at mistakes and muddles\nof his own. (Ryle 270)\n",
