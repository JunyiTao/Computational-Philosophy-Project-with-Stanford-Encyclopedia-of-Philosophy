Commentaries on Texts from the Corpus Aristotelicum\n\n\nIn no other period of the history of philosophy, as far as we know,\nhave so many commentaries on works by Aristotle been written (both per\nyear and in total) as in the\n Renaissance.[5] \n Even on the incomplete basis of Lohr\u2019s first version of his catalogue\nof Renaissance Latin Aristotle\n Commentaries[6] \n Richard Blum has counted 6653 such commentaries for the period\n1500 to\n 1650.[7] \n The magnitude of this number should be considered\nsignificant\u2014especially in comparison to the ca. 750\ncommentaries listed for the fifteenth century in Lohr\u2019s\ncatalogue of \u201cmediaeval\u201d Aristotle\n commentaries.[8]\n\n\n\nThe real reasons of this increase of interest are yet\nunknown. However, the reasons might include:\n\nthe rising number of universities (probably connected with a\nrising number of persons in charge of expounding works of Aristotle to\ntheir students),\nenhanced access to existing scholarship on Aristotle and the corpus aristotelicum by the advent of \n printing[9] \nenhancement of propagation (and thus broader visibility) of\ncommentaries by the advent of\n printing[10] \nchanges in the role of philosophy education at universities\nand a resulting need for new commentaries,\nadvances and new trends in Aristotle scholarship (including strong\nreception of the Greek Aristotle commentaries!), and the need to react\nto them,\nimpact of texts from outside the Aristotelian tradition,\nreaction to extra-philosophical problems and phenomena.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to name Renaissance Aristotle commentaries influenced\nby one or more of each of these. As a whole, the reasons given above\ncontribute to the great variety of what can be found in Renaissance\nAristotle\n commentaries[11].\n It may even be that such delightful variety is what chiefly attracts\ncurrent scholars to studying this genre of philosophical\nliterature. And yet most of these commentaries have not yet been\nstudied by anyone since the \n Renaissance.[12] \n\n\nThere have been some attempts to sort Renaissance Aristotle\ncommentators into groups according to their use of or degree of\nadherence to pre-Renaissance Aristotle commentaries (e.g.,\n\u201cAverroist\u201d, \u201cAlexandrist\u201d,\n\u201cThomist\u201d schools/groups/traditions). However, it is\ndoubtful that such a sorting contributes to a better understanding of\ntheir texts and contexts.  This is because many authors of Aristotle\ncommentaries\u2014including some who had a particular preference\nfor one or more of the earlier commentators\u2014used the earlier\ncommentaries on a case by case basis.\n\n\nAs far as we know, most of these commentaries were written for use in\na university setting (see below). As a consequence, the choice of\ntexts commented upon and the degree of detail given to a certain\npassage is often due, at least in part, to its use in a classroom, a\nuniversitarian debate or its relevance for exams.\n\n\nThere are no sharp borderlines between commentaries proper, textbooks,\nencyclopedias, and treatises. (Philipp Melanchthon\u2019s works on ethics\nmight be a good illustration of this: \u201cMelanchthon on\nEthics\u201d starts as something which is a commentary on parts of\nthe Nicomachean Ethics [Melanchthon, 1535] and\u2014in the\n1550 and later versions, now edited and translated by G\u00fcnter Frank\u2014was \ndeveloped into something which is a textbook in which rather few\ntraces of and similarities to the commentary genre are left\n[Melanchthon, 2008].)  And even where the work in question is a\ncommentary in the most narrow sense of the word, the text can be some\nsort of bibliographie raison\u00e9e of the previous\nliterature (e.g., some of Augustinus Niphus\u2019s texts), a decent guide\nto some probable meaning of Aristotle\u2019s text (e.g., some of Cesare\nCremonini\u2019s commentaries on the Parva naturalia), or a text\nwritten in order to influence the political world of the day (e.g.,\nAntonio Montecatini\u2019s commentary on the third book of Aristotle\u2019s\npolitics [Montecatini, 1597]), or anything in-between.\n\n\nAlthough most of the commentaries apparently deal with those texts\nfrom the corpus aristotelicum that have been the focus of\ninterest from the 13th century to today, the Renaissance is a period\nwhere the percentage of commentaries and other texts dealing with the works of Aristotle less frequently read today (e.g., the\nProblemata, the Parva naturalia) is higher than\none might expect.\n",
