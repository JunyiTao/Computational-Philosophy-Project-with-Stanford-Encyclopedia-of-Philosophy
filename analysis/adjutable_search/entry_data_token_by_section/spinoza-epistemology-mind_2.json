    "main_text": "Guiding commitments || The priority of an infinite thinker\n1.3 The priority of an infinite thinker\n\nAs we just saw, Spinoza derives his prohibition of mental explanations\nof physical actions from what he takes to be true of the relation\nbetween the mental and the physical in the case of God. This\nis an instance of a more general methodological and epistemological\nprinciple Spinoza holds dear, that of the explanatory\npriority of claims about substance (God) to claims about modes\n(creatures) (E1p1, E1p15). To return to our toy analogy, we can only\nunderstand what it is to be a wrinkle in a rug if we first understand\nwhat it is to be a rug. For Spinoza, philosophizing in proper order\nalways requires us to start with God (E2p10s).\n\nGiven this explanatory priority of substance, to understand what it\nmeans to think or to have a mind we also cannot\nsimply extrapolate from our own case (for example, from\nintrospection, or from observing the behavior of fellow humans).\nRather, to understand thought and mindedness we first have to\nunderstand the nature of divine thought, i.e., what it means\nto be an \u201cinfinite\u201d \u2013 unlimited and self-sufficient\n\u2013 thinker. This is the fundamental case of thinking for\nSpinoza.\n\nWhat does this infinite thought amount to? In one sense, it is simply\nan endorsement of the traditional doctrine of divine omniscience. In\nSpinoza\u2019s framework, this doctrine becomes the claim that, as a\nthinking thing (i.e., a substance with the attribute of thought) God\nnecessarily produces an \u201cinfinite idea\u201d, that is,\nan infinite modification of God\u2019s nature as a thinking thing\n(E2p1, E2p3, E2p7c). This infinite idea is a complete and veridical\nrepresentation of everything that is, every bit of reality (E2p32).\n(Spinoza also calls this infinite mode an \u201cinfinite\nintellect\u201d [E2p11c], seemingly without distinguishing the two\nterms.)\n\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Spinoza is making here two\ndistinct claims: to say that God is a substance with the attribute of\nthought (that is, a thing whose essential nature it is to think) is\nontologically and explanatorily prior to the claim that this\nthinking substance also produces an actual representation or\nidea of everything (which is a claim about the existence of a certain\nkind of infinite mode). So although Spinoza faithfully\nfollows tradition in endorsing the claims that God thinks and is\nomniscient, he also ends up with a quite nontraditional result: the\ndivine \u201cinfinite intellect\u201d is not part of, or identical\nwith, divine nature or essence. In terms of its\nontological status, the divine intellect is on par with finite minds\ninsofar as these too are merely modes.\n\nThe belief that the metaphysically basic instance of thinking is the\nthinking done by an infallible and omniscient thinker goes some way\ntoward explaining why Spinoza seems unconcerned about the threat of\nskepticism, so salient for Descartes (see also 3.1). For Spinoza\nthought in its fundamental instance is necessarily true; it\n\u201cagrees\u201d (E1ax6) with how things really are. So\nglobal skepticism is simply a metaphysical impossibility; all\nthat remains of the skeptical threat is to be on guard against local\ninstances of confusion and error that become possible in the\nderivative case of finite thought. Moreover, all such confusion and\nerror need some further cause beyond the intrinsic nature of thought.\n(Indeed, one might worry that Spinoza lets the pendulum swing too far\nin the opposite direction: global skepticism might no longer be\npossible, but it might now be hard to see how error could be\npossible, if, in Spinoza\u2019s substance-monistic framework, all\nideas are ultimately God\u2019s own [see 3.2.2].)\n\n(On Spinoza\u2019s understanding of thinking, see e.g. Melamed 2013,\nNewlands 2018, Renz 2018; on his two proofs that God thinks, e.g.\nDella Rocca 1996, Gueroult 1974; on skepticism, e.g. Carriero 2020,\nPerler 2018, Primus 2017.)\n",
