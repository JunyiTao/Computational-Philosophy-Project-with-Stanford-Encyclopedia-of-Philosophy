Critical Reactions to Arithmetization\n\nDespite the great success of Weierstrass, Dedekind and Cantor in\nconstructing the continuum from arithmetical materials, a number of\nthinkers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries remained\nopposed, in varying degrees, to the idea of explicating the continuum\nconcept entirely in discrete terms. These include the philosophers\nBrentano and Peirce and the mathematicians Poincar\u00e9, Brouwer\nand Weyl.\n\nIn his later years the Austrian philosopher Franz Brentano\n(1838\u20131917) became preoccupied with the nature of the continuous\n(Brentano [PISTC]). In its fundamentals Brentano\u2019s account\nof the continuous is akin to Aristotle\u2019s. Brentano regards\ncontinuity as something given in perception, primordial in nature,\nrather than a mathematical construction. He held that the idea of the\ncontinuous is abstracted from sensible intuition. Brentano suggests\nthat the continuous is brought to appearance by sensible intuition in\nthree phases. First, sensation presents us with objects having parts\nthat coincide. From such objects the concept of boundary is\nabstracted in turn, and then one grasps that these objects actually\ncontain coincident boundaries. Finally one sees that this is\nall that is required in order to have grasped the concept of a\ncontinuum.\n\nFor Brentano the essential feature of a continuum is its inherent\ncapacity to engender boundaries, and the fact that such boundaries can\nbe grasped as coincident. Boundaries themselves possess a quality\nwhich Brentano calls plerosis (\u201cfullness\u201d).\nPlerosis is the measure of the number of directions in which the given\nboundary actually bounds. Thus, for example, within a temporal\ncontinuum the endpoint of a past episode or the starting point of a\nfuture one bounds in a single direction, while the point marking the\nend of one episode and the beginning of another may be said to bound\ndoubly. In the case of a spatial continuum there are numerous\nadditional possibilities: here a boundary may bound in all the\ndirections of which it is capable of bounding, or it may bound in only\nsome of these directions. In the former case, the boundary is said to\nexist in full plerosis; in the latter, in partial\nplerosis. Brentano believed that the concept of plerosis enabled\nsense to be made of the idea that a boundary possesses\n\u201cparts\u201d, even when the boundary lacks dimensions\naltogether, as in the case of a point. Thus, while the present or\n\u201cnow\u201d is, according to Brentano, temporally unextended and\nexists only as a boundary between past and future, it still possesses\ntwo \u201cparts\u201d or aspects: it is both the end of the past and\nthe beginning of the future. It is worth mentioning that for Brentano\nit was not just the \u201cnow\u201d that existed only as a boundary;\nsince, like Aristotle he held that \u201cexistence\u201d in the\nstrict sense means \u201cexistence now\u201d, it\nnecessarily followed that existing things exist only as boundaries of\nwhat has existed or of what will exist, or both.\n\nBrentano took a somewhat dim view of the efforts of mathematicians to\nconstruct the continuum from numbers. His attitude varied from\nrejecting such attempts as inadequate to according them the status of\n \u201cfictions\u201d.[37]\n This is not surprising given his Aristotelian inclination to take\nmathematical and physical theories to be genuine descriptions of\nempirical phenomena rather than idealizations: in his view, if such\ntheories were to be taken as literal descriptions of experience, they\nwould amount to nothing better than\n\u201cmisrepresentations\u201d.\n\nBrentano\u2019s analysis of the continuum centered on its\nphenomenological and qualitative aspects, which are by their very\nnature incapable of reduction to the discrete. Brentano\u2019s\nrejection of the mathematicians\u2019 attempts to construct it in\ndiscrete terms is thus hardly surprising.\n\nThe American philosopher-mathematician Charles Sanders Peirce\u2019s\n(1839\u20131914) view of the\n continuum[38]\n was, in a sense, intermediate between that of Brentano and the\narithmetizers. Like Brentano, he held that the cohesiveness of a\ncontinuum rules out the possibility of it being a mere collection of\ndiscrete individuals, or points, in the usual sense. And even before\nBrouwer, Peirce seems to have been aware that a faithful account of\nthe continuum will involve questioning the law of excluded middle.\nPeirce also held that any continuum harbors an unboundedly\nlarge collection of points\u2014in his colorful terminology, a\nsupermultitudinous collection\u2014what we would today call\na proper class. Peirce maintained that if\nenough points were to be crowded together by carrying insertion of new\npoints between old to its ultimate limit they would\u2014through\na logical \u201ctransformation of quantity into\nquality\u201d\u2014lose their individual identity and become fused\ninto a true continuum.\n\nPeirce\u2019s conception of the number continuum is also notable for\nthe presence in it of an abundance of infinitesimals, Peirce\nchampioned the retention of the infinitesimal concept in the\nfoundations of the calculus, both because of what he saw as the\nefficiency of infinitesimal methods, and because he regarded\ninfinitesimals as constituting the \u201cglue\u201d causing points\non a continuous line to lose their individual identity.\n\nThe idea of continuity played a central role in the thought of the\ngreat French mathematician Henri\n Poincar\u00e9[39]\n (1854\u20131912). While accepting the arithmetic definition of the\ncontinuum, he questions the fact that (as with Dedekind and\nCantor\u2019s formulations) the (irrational) numbers so produced are\nmere symbols, detached from their origins in intuition. Unlike Cantor,\nPoincar\u00e9 accepted the infinitesimal, even if he did not regard\nall of the concept\u2019s manifestations as useful.\n\nThe Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer (1881\u20131966) is best\nknown as the founder of the philosophy of (neo)intuitionism\n(Brouwer [1975]; van Dalen 1998). Brouwer\u2019s highly idealist\nviews on mathematics bore some resemblance to Kant\u2019s. For\nBrouwer, mathematical concepts are admissible only if they are\nadequately grounded in intuition, mathematical theories are\nsignificant only if they concern entities which are constructed out of\nsomething given immediately in intuition, and mathematical\ndemonstration is a form of construction in intuition. While admitting\nthat the emergence of noneuclidean geometry had discredited\nKant\u2019s view of space, Brouwer held, in opposition to the\nlogicists (whom he called \u201cformalists\u201d) that arithmetic,\nand so all mathematics, must derive from temporal intuition.\n\nInitially Brouwer held without qualification that the continuum is not\nconstructible from discrete points, but was later to modify this\ndoctrine. In his mature thought, he radically transformed the concept\nof point, endowing points with sufficient fluidity to enable them to\nserve as generators of a \u201ctrue\u201d continuum. This fluidity\nwas achieved by admitting as \u201cpoints\u201d, not only fully\ndefined discrete numbers such as \\(\\sqrt{2},\\) \\(\\pi,\\) \\(e,\\) and the\nlike\u2014which have, so to speak, already achieved\n\u201cbeing\u201d\u2014but also \u201cnumbers\u201d which are in\na perpetual state of becoming in that there the entries in their\ndecimal (or dyadic) expansions are the result of free acts of choice\nby a subject operating throughout an indefinitely extended time. The\nresulting choice sequences cannot be conceived as finished,\ncompleted objects: at any moment only an initial segment is known. In\nthis way Brouwer obtained the mathematical continuum in a way\ncompatible with his belief in the primordial intuition of\ntime\u2014that is, as an unfinished, indeed unfinishable entity in a\nperpetual state of growth, a \u201cmedium of free development\u201d.\nIn this conception, the mathematical continuum is indeed\n\u201cconstructed\u201d, not, however, by initially shattering, as\ndid Cantor and Dedekind, an intuitive continuum into isolated points,\nbut rather by assembling it from a complex of continually changing\noverlapping parts.\n\nThe mathematical continuum as conceived by Brouwer displays a number\nof features that seem bizarre to the classical eye. For example, in\nthe Brouwerian continuum the usual law of comparability, namely that\nfor any real numbers \\(a, b\\) either \\(a \\lt b\\) or \\(a = b\\) or \\(a\n\\gt b\\), fails. Even more fundamental is the failure of the law of\nexcluded middle in the form that for any real numbers \\(a, b\\), either\n\\(a = b\\) or \\(a \\ne b\\). The failure of these seemingly\nunquestionable principles in turn vitiates the proofs of a number of\nbasic results of classical analysis, for example the\nBolzano-Weierstrass theorem, as well as the theorems of monotone\nconvergence, intermediate value, least upper bound, and maximum value\nfor continuous\n functions.[40]\n\nWhile the Brouwerian continuum may possess a number of negative\nfeatures from the standpoint of the classical mathematician, it has\nthe merit of corresponding more closely to the continuum of intuition\nthan does its classical counterpart. Far from being bizarre, the\nfailure of the law of excluded middle for points in the intuitionistic\ncontinuum may be seen as fitting in well with the character of the\nintuitive continuum.\n\nIn 1924, Brouwer showed that every function defined on a closed\ninterval of his continuum is uniformly continuous.  As a consequence\nthe intuitionistic continuum is indecomposable, that is,\ncannot be split into two disjoint parts in any way whatsoever. In\ncontrast with a discrete entity, the indecomposable Brouwerian\ncontinuum cannot be composed of its parts.  Brouwer\u2019s vision of\nthe continuum has in recent years become the subject of intensive\nmathematical investigation.\n\nHermann Weyl (1885\u20131955), one of most versatile mathematicians\nof the twentieth century, was preoccupied with the nature of the\ncontinuum (Bell 2000). In his Das Kontinuum of 1918 he\nattempts to provide the continuum with an exact mathematical\nformulation free of the set-theoretic assumptions he had come to\nregard as objectionable. As he saw it, there is an unbridgeable gap\nbetween intuitively given continua (e.g., those of space, time and\nmotion) on the one hand, and the discrete exact concepts of\nmathematics (e.g., that of real number) on the other. For Weyl the\npresence of this split meant that the construction of the mathematical\ncontinuum could not simply be \u201cread off\u201d from intuition.\nRather, he believed that the mathematical continuum must be treated\nand, in the end, justified in the same way as a physical theory.\nHowever much he may have wished it, in Das Kontinuum Weyl did\nnot aim to provide a mathematical formulation of the continuum as it\nis presented to intuition, which, as the quotations above show, he\nregarded as an impossibility (at that time at least). Rather, his goal\nwas first to achieve consistency by putting the\narithmetical notion of real number on a firm logical basis,\nand then to show that the resulting theory is reasonable by\nemploying it as the foundation for a plausible account of continuous\nprocess in the objective physical world.\n\nLater Weyl came to repudiate atomistic theories of the continuum,\nincluding that of his own Das Kontinuum. He accordingly\nwelcomed Brouwer\u2019s construction of the continuum by means of\nsequences generated by free acts of choice, thus identifying it as a\n\u201cmedium of free Becoming\u201d which \u201cdoes not dissolve\ninto a set of real numbers as finished entities\u201d (Weyl 1921,\n50). Weyl felt that Brouwer, through his doctrine of intuitionism, had\ncome closer than anyone else to bridging that \u201cunbridgeable\nchasm\u201d between the intuitive and mathematical continua. In\nparticular, he found compelling the fact that the Brouwerian continuum\nis not the union of two disjoint nonempty parts\u2014that it is\nindecomposable. \u201cA genuine continuum\u201d, Weyl says,\n\u201ccannot be divided into separate fragments\u201d. In later\npublications he expresses this more colorfully by quoting Anaxagoras\nto the effect that a continuum \u201cdefies the chopping off of its\nparts with a hatchet\u201d.\n",
