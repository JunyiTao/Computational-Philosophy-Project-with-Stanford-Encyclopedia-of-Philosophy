    "main_text": "Being and Time || Division 2\n2.3 Division 2\n2.3.1 Death\n\n\nAs the argument of Being and Time continues its\never-widening hermeneutic spiral into Division 2 of the text, Heidegger\nannounces a twofold transition in the analysis. He argues that we\nshould (i) pay proper heed to the thought that to understand Dasein we\nneed to understand Dasein's existence as a whole, and\n(ii) shift the main focus of our attention from the inauthentic self\n(the they-self) to the authentic self (the mine-self) (Being and\nTime 45: 276). Both of these transitions figure in\nHeidegger's discussion of death.\n\n\nSo far, Dasein's existence has been understood as thrown\nprojection plus falling. The projective aspect of this phenomenon means\nthat, at each moment of its life, Dasein is Being-ahead-of-itself,\noriented towards the realm of its possibilities, and is thus\nincomplete. Death completes Dasein's existence. Therefore, an\nunderstanding of Dasein's relation to death would make an\nessential contribution to our understanding of Dasein as a whole. But\nnow a problem immediately presents itself: since one cannot experience\none's own death, it seems that the kind of phenomenological\nanalysis that has hitherto driven the argument of Being and\nTime breaks\ndown, right at the crucial moment. One possible response to this worry,\ncanvassed explicitly by Heidegger, is to suggest that Dasein\nunderstands death through experiencing the death of others. However,\nthe sense in which we experience the death of others falls short of\nwhat is needed. We mourn departed others and miss their presence in the\nworld. But that is to experience Being-with them as dead, which is a\nmode of our continued existence. As Heidegger explains:\n\n\nThe greater the phenomenal appropriateness with which we take the\nno-longer-Dasein of the deceased, the more plainly is it shown that in\nsuch Being-with the dead, the authentic Being-come-to-an-end of the\ndeceased is precisely the sort of thing which we do not\nexperience. Death does indeed reveal itself as a loss, but a loss such\nas is experienced by those who remain. In suffering this loss, however,\nwe have no way of access to the loss-of-Being as such which the dying\nman \u2018suffers\u2019. The dying of Others is not something which\nwe experience in a genuine sense; at most we are always just\n\u2018there alongside\u2019. (Being and Time 47: 282)\n\n\nWhat we don't have, then, is phenomenological access to the\nloss of Being that the dead person has suffered. But that, it seems, is\nprecisely what we would need in order to carry through the favoured\nanalysis. So another response is called for. Heidegger's move is\nto suggest that although Dasein cannot experience its own death as\nactual, it can relate towards its own death as a possibility that is\nalways before it\u2014always before it in the sense that\nDasein's own death is inevitable. Peculiarly among Dasein's\npossibilities, the possibility of Dasein's own death must remain\nonly a possibility, since once it becomes actual, Dasein is no longer.\nDeath is thus the \u201cpossibility of the impossibility of any\nexistence at all\u201d (Being and Time 53: 307). And it is\nthis awareness of death as an omnipresent possibility that cannot\nbecome actual that stops the phenomenological analysis from breaking\ndown. The detail here is crucial. What the failure of the \u2018death\nof others\u2019 strategy indicates is that in each instance death is\ninextricably tied to some specific individual Dasein. My death is mine\nin a radical sense; it is the moment at which all my relations to\nothers disappear. Heidegger captures this non-relationality by using\nthe term \u2018ownmost\u2019. And it is the idea of death \u201cas\nthat possibility which is one's ownmost\u201d (Being and\nTime 50: 294) that engages the second transition highlighted\nabove. When I take on board the possibility of my own not-Being, my own\nbeing-able-to-Be is brought into proper view. Hence my awareness of my\nown death as an omnipresent possibility discloses the authentic self (a\nself that is mine). Moreover, the very same awareness engages the first\nof the aforementioned transitions too: there is a sense in which the\npossibility of my not existing encompasses the whole of my existence\n(Hinman 1978, 201), and my awareness of that possibility illuminates\nme, qua Dasein, in my totality. Indeed, my own death is\nrevealed to me as inevitable, meaning that Dasein is essentially\nfinite. This explains why Heidegger says that death is disclosed to\nDasein as a possibility which is \u201cnot to be outstripped\u201d\n(Being and Time 50: 294).\n\n\nHeidegger's account of Dasein's relation towards the\npossibility of its own not-Being forms the backbone of a\nreinterpretation of the phenomenon of care\u2014the \u201cformally\nexistential totality of Dasein's ontological structural\nwhole\u201d (Being and Time 41: 237). Care is now interpreted\nin terms of Being-towards-death, meaning that Dasein has an internal\nrelation to the nothing (i.e., to not-being; see Vallega-Neu 2003, 21,\nfor an analysis that links this \u2018not\u2019 quality to the point\nmade earlier that sets of unactualized possibilities of Being are\nstructural components of Dasein's Being). As one might expect,\nHeidegger argues that Being-towards-death not only has the\nthree-dimensional character of care, but is realized in authentic and\ninauthentic modes. Let's begin with the authentic mode. We can\nthink of the aforementioned individualizing effect of Dasein's\nawareness of the possibility of its own not-Being (an awareness that\nilluminates its own being-able-to-Be) as an event in which Dasein\nprojects onto a possible way to be, in the technical sense of such\npossibilities introduced earlier in Being and Time. It is thus\nan event in which Dasein projects onto a for-the-sake-of-which, a\npossible way to be. More particularly, given the authentic character of\nthe phenomenon, it is an event in which Dasein projects onto a\nfor-the-sake-of-itself. Heidegger now coins the term\nanticipation to express the form of projection in which one\nlooks forward to a possible way to be. Given the analysis of death as a\npossibility, the authentic form of projection in the case of death is\nanticipation. Indeed Heidegger often uses the term anticipation in a\nnarrow way, simply to mean being aware of death as a possibility. But\ndeath is disclosed authentically not only in projection (the first\ndimension of care) but also in thrownness (the second dimension). The\nkey phenomenon here is the mode of disposedness that Heidegger calls\nanxiety. Anxiety, at least in the form in which Heidegger is\ninterested, is not directed towards some specific object, but rather\nopens up the world to me in a certain distinctive way. When I am\nanxious I am no longer at home in the world. I fail to find the world\nintelligible. Thus there is an ontological sense (one to do with\nintelligibility) in which I am not in the world, and the possibility of\na world without me (the possibility of my not-Being-in-the-world) is\nrevealed to me. \u201c[The] state-of-mind [mode of disposedness] which\ncan hold open the utter and constant threat to itself arising from\nDasein's ownmost individualized Being, is anxiety. In this\nstate-of-mind, Dasein finds itself face to face with the\n\u2018nothing\u2019 of the possible impossibility of its\nexistence\u201d (Being and Time 53: 310). Heidegger has now\nreinterpreted two of the three dimensions of care, in the light of\nDasein's essential finitude. But now what about the third\ndimension, identified previously as fallen-ness? Since we are presently\nconsidering a mode of authentic, i.e., not fallen, Dasein, it seems that\nfallen-ness cannot be a feature of this realization of care, and indeed\nthat a general reformulation of the care structure is called for in\norder to allow for authentic Being. This is an issue that will be\naddressed in the next section. First, though, the inauthentic form of\nBeing-towards-death needs to be brought into view.\n\n\nIn everyday Being-towards-death, the self that figures in the\nfor-the-sake-of-itself structure is not the authentic mine-self, but\nrather the inauthentic they-self. In effect, the \u2018they\u2019\nobscures our awareness of the meaning of our own deaths by\nde-individualizing death. As Heidegger explains: in\n\u201cDasein's public way of interpreting, it is said that\n\u2018one dies\u2019, because everyone else and oneself can talk\nhimself into saying that \u2018in no case is it I myself\u2019, for this\n\u2018one\u2019 is the \u2018nobody\u2019\u2009\u201d (Being and Time 51:\n297). In this way, everyday Dasein flees from the meaning of its own\ndeath, in a manner determined by the \u2018they\u2019. It is in this\nevasion in the face of death, interpreted as a further way in which\nDasein covers up Being, that everyday Dasein's fallen-ness now\nmanifests itself. To be clear: evasion here does not necessarily mean\nthat I refuse outright to acknowledge that I will someday die. After\nall, as I might say, \u2018everyone dies\u2019. However, the\ncertainty of death achieved by idle talk of this kind is of the wrong\nsort. One might think of it as established by the conclusion of some\nsort of inductive inference from observations of many cases of death\n(the deaths of many others). But \u201cwe cannot compute the certainty\nof death by ascertaining how many cases of death we encounter\u201d\n(Being and Time 53: 309).\n\n\nThe certainty brought into view by such an inference is a sort of\nempirical certainty, one which conceals the apodictic character of the\ninevitability with which my own death is authentically revealed to me\n(Being and Time 52: 301). In addition, as we have seen,\naccording to Heidegger, my own death can never be actual for me, so\nviewed from my perspective, any case of death, i.e., any actual death,\ncannot be my death. Thus it must be a death that belongs to someone\nelse, or rather, to no one.\n\n\nInauthenticity in relation to death is also realized in thrownness,\nthrough fear, and in projection, through expectation.\nFear, as a mode of disposedness, can disclose only particular oncoming\nevents in the world. To fear my own death, then, is once again\nto treat my death as a case of death. This contrasts with anxiety, the\nform of disposedness which, as we have seen, discloses my death via the\nawareness of the possibility of a world in which I am not. The\nprojective analogue to the fear-anxiety distinction is\nexpectation-anticipation. A mundane example might help to illustrate\nthe generic idea. When I expect a beer to taste a certain way, I am\nwaiting for an actual event\u2014a case of that distinctive taste in\nmy mouth\u2014to occur. By contrast, when I anticipate the taste of\nthat beer, one might say that, in a cognitive sense, I actively go out\nto meet the possibility of that taste. In so doing, I make it mine.\nExpecting death is thus to wait for a case of death, whereas to\nanticipate death is to own it. \n\nIn reinterpreting care in terms of Being-towards-death, Heidegger\nilluminates in a new way the taking-as structure that, as we have seen,\nhe takes to be the essence of human existence. Human beings, as Dasein,\nare essentially finite. And it is this\nfinitude that explains why the phenomenon of taking-as is an\nessential characteristic of our existence. An infinite Being would\nunderstand things directly, without the need for interpretative\nintercession. We, however, are Dasein, and in our essential finitude we\nmust understand things in a hermeneutically mediated, indirect way,\nthat is, by taking-as (Sheehan 2001). \nWhat are we to make of Heidegger's analysis of death? Perhaps\nthe most compelling reason for being sceptical can be found in Sartre,\nwho argued that just as death cannot be actual for me, it cannot be one\nof my possibilities either, at least if the term\n\u2018possibility\u2019 is understood, as Heidegger surely intends it\nto be, as marking a way of my Being, an intelligible way for me to be.\nSartre argues that death is the end of such possibilities. Thus:\n\n\n\n[The] perpetual appearance of chance at the heart of my projects\ncannot be apprehended as my possibility but, on the contrary, as the\nnihilation of all my possibilities. A nihilation which itself is no\nlonger a part of my possibilities. Thus death is not my possibility of\nno longer realizing a presence in the world but rather an always\npossible nihilation of my possibilities which is outside my\npossibilities. (Sartre 1956, 537)\n\n\nIf Sartre is right, there is a\nsignificant hole in Heidegger's project, since we would be left\nwithout a way of completing the phenomenological analysis of\nDasein.\n\n\nFor further debate over Heidegger's handling of death, see\nEdwards' (1975, 1976, 2004) unsympathetic broadsides alongside\nHinman's (1978) robust response. Carel (2006) develops an\nanalysis that productively connects Heidegger's and\nFreud's accounts of death, despite Heidegger's open\nantipathy towards Freud's theories in general.\n2.3.2 Anticipatory Resoluteness\n\n\nIn some of the most difficult sections of Being and Time,\nHeidegger now begins to close in on the claim that temporality is the\nontological meaning of Dasein's Being as care. The key notion\nhere is that of anticipatory resoluteness, which Heidegger identifies\nas an (or perhaps the) authentic mode of care. As we have\nseen, anticipation is the form of Being-towards in which one looks\nforward to a possible way to be. Bringing resoluteness into\nview requires further groundwork that begins with Heidegger's\nreinterpretation of the authentic self in terms of the phenomenon of\nconscience or Being-guilty. The authentic self is characterized by\nBeing-guilty. This does not mean that authenticity requires actually\nfeeling guilty. Rather, the authentic self is the one who is open\nto the call of conscience. The inauthentic self, by contrast, is\nclosed to conscience and guilt. It is tempting to think that this is\nwhere Heidegger does ethics. However, guilt as an existential structure\nis not to be understood as some psychological feeling that one gets\nwhen one transgresses some moral code. If the term \u2018guilt\u2019\nis to be heard in an ethical register at all, the phenomenon of\nBeing-guilty will, for Heidegger, be the a priori condition for there\nto be moral codes, not the psychological result of transgressions of\nthose codes. Having said that, however, it may be misleading to adopt\nan ethical register here. For Heidegger, conscience is fundamentally a\ndisclosive rather than an ethical phenomenon. What is more important\nfor the project of Being and Time, then, is the claim that the\ncall of conscience interrupts Dasein's everyday fascination with\nentities by summoning Dasein back to its own finitude and thereby to\nauthenticity. To see how the call of conscience achieves this, we need\nto unpack Heidegger's reformulation of conscience in terms of\nanticipatory resoluteness. \n\n\nIn the by-now familiar pattern, Heidegger argues that conscience\n(Being-guilty) has the structure of care. However, there's now a\nmodification to the picture, presumably driven by a factor mentioned\nearlier, namely that authentic Dasein is not fallen. Since conscience\nis a mode of authentic Dasein, fallen-ness cannot be one of the\ndimensions of conscience. So the three elements of care are now\nidentified as projection, thrownness and discourse. What is\ndiscourse? It clearly has something to do with articulation, and it is\ntempting to make a connection with language, but in truth this aspect\nof Heidegger's view is somewhat murky. Heidegger says that the\n\u201cintelligibility of Being-in-the-world\u2026 expresses itself\nas discourse\u201d (Being and Time 34: 204). But this might\nmean that intelligibility is essentially a linguistic phenomenon; or it\nmight mean that discourse is intelligibility as put into language.\nThere is even room for the view that discourse is not necessarily a\nlinguistic phenomenon at all, but rather any way in which the\nreferential structure of significance is articulated, either by deeds\n(e.g., by hammering) or by words (see e.g., Dreyfus 1991, 215; Dreyfus\ntranslates the German term Rede not as \u2018discourse\u2019\nbut as \u2018telling\u2019, and notes the existence of non-linguistic\ntellings such as telling the time). But however we settle that point of\ninterpretation, there is something untidy about the status of discourse\nin relation to fallen-ness and authenticity. Elsewhere in Being and\nTime, the text strongly suggests that discourse has inauthentic\nmodes, for instance when it is manifested as idle talk; and in yet\nother sections we find the claim that fallen-ness has an authentic\nmanifestation called a moment-of-vision (e.g., Being and\nTime 68: 401). Regarding the general relations between discourse,\nfallen-ness and authenticity, then, the conceptual landscape is not\nentirely clear. Nevertheless, we can say this: when care is realized\nauthentically, I experience discourse as reticence, as a\nkeeping silent (ignoring the chatter of idle talk) so that I may hear\nthe call of conscience; I experience projection onto guilt as a\npossible way of Being in which I take responsibility for a lack or a\nnot-Being that is located firmly in my own self (where \u2018taking\nresponsibility for\u2019 means recognizing that not-Being is one of\nmy essential structures); and I experience thrownness as\nanxiety, a mode of disposedness that, as we have seen, leaves me\nestranged from the familiar field of intelligibility determined by the\n\u2018they\u2019 and thereby discloses the possibility of my own\nnot-Being. So, reticence, guilt and anxiety all have the effect of\nextracting Dasein from the ontological clutches of the\n\u2018they\u2019. That is why the unitary structure of\nreticence-guilt-anxiety characterizes the Being of authentic\nDasein.\n\n\nSo now what of resoluteness? \u2018Resoluteness\u2019 is perhaps\nbest understood as simply a new term for reticence-guilt-anxiety. But\nwhy do we need a new term? There are two possible reasons for thinking\nthat the relabelling exercise here adds value. Each of these indicates\na connection between authenticity and freedom. Each corresponds to an\nauthentic realization of one of two possible understandings of what\nHeidegger means by (human) existence (see above). The first take on\nresoluteness is emphasized by, for example, Gelven (1989), Mulhall\n(2005) and Polt (1999). In ordinary parlance, to be resolved is to\ncommit oneself to some project and thus, in a sense, to take ownership\nof one's life. By succumbing to, but without making any real\ncommitment to, the patterns laid down by the \u2018they\u2019 (i.e.,\nby uncritically \u2018doing what one does\u2019), inauthentic Dasein\navoids owning its own life. Authentic Being (understood as\nresoluteness) is, then, a freedom from the \u2018they\u2019\u2014not, of course, in any sense that involves extracting oneself from\none's socio-cultural embeddedness (after all, Being-with is part\nof Dasein's existential constitution), but rather in a sense that\ninvolves individual commitment to (and thus individual ownership of)\none of the possible ways to be that one's socio-cultural\nembeddedness makes available (more on this below). Seen like this,\nresoluteness correlates with the idea that Dasein's existence is\nconstituted by a series of events in which possible ways to be are\nchosen.\n\n\nAt this point we would do well to hesitate. The emphasis on notions\nsuch as choice and commitment makes it all too easy to think that\nresoluteness essentially involves some sort of conscious\ndecision-making. For this reason, Vallega-Neu (2003, 15) reminds us\nthat resoluteness is not a \u201cchoice made by a human subject\u201d\nbut rather an \u201coccurrence that determines Dasein\u201d. This\noccurrence discloses Dasein's essential finitude. It is here that\nit is profitable to think in terms of anticipatory\nresoluteness. Heidegger's claim is that resoluteness and\nanticipation are internally related, such that they ultimately emerge\ntogether as the unitary phenomenon of anticipatory resoluteness. Thus,\nhe argues, Being-guilty (the projective aspect of resoluteness)\ninvolves Dasein wanting to be open to the call of conscience for as\nlong as Dasein exists, which requires an awareness of the possibility\nof death. Since resoluteness is an authentic mode of Being, this\nawareness of the possibility of death must also be authentic. But the\nauthentic awareness of the possibility of death just is anticipation\n(see above). Thus \u201conly as anticipating does resoluteness become\na primordial Being towards Dasein's ownmost\npotentiality-for-Being\u201d (Being and Time 62: 354). Via\nthe internal connection with anticipation, then, the notion of\nresoluteness allows Heidegger to rethink the path to Dasein's\nessential finitude, a finitude that is hidden in fallen-ness, but\nwhich, as we have seen, is the condition of possibility for the\ntaking-as structure that is a constitutive aspect of Dasein. Seen this\nway, resoluteness correlates more neatly with the idea that human\nexistence is essentially a standing out in an openness to, and in an\nopening of, Being.\n2.3.3 Temporality and Temporalizing\n\n\nIn a further hermeneutic spiral, Heidegger concludes that\ntemporality is the a priori transcendental condition for there to be\ncare (sense-making, intelligibility, taking-as, Dasein's own\ndistinctive mode of Being). Moreover, it is Dasein's openness to\ntime that ultimately allows Dasein's potential authenticity to be\nactualized: in authenticity, the constraints and possibilities\ndetermined by Dasein's cultural-historical past are grasped by\nDasein in the present so that it may project itself into the future in\na fully authentic manner, i.e., in a manner which is truest to the\nmine-self.\n\n\nThe ontological emphasis that\nHeidegger places on temporality might usefully be seen as an echo and\ndevelopment of Kant's claim that embeddedness in time is a\nprecondition for things to appear to us the way they do. (According to Kant, embeddedness in time is co-determinative of our\nexperience, along with embeddedness in space. See above for\nHeidegger's problematic analysis of the relationship between\nspatiality and temporality.) With the Kantian roots of\nHeidegger's treatment of time acknowledged, it must be registered\nimmediately that, in Heidegger's hands, the notion of temporality\nreceives a distinctive twist. Heidegger is concerned not with\nclock-time (an infinite series of self-contained nows laid out in an\nordering of past, present and future) or with time as some sort of\nrelativistic phenomenon that would satisfy the physicist. Time thought\nof in either of these ways is a present-at-hand phenomenon, and that\nmeans that it cannot characterize the temporality that is an internal\nfeature of Dasein's existential constitution, the existential\ntemporality that structures intelligibility (taking-as). As he puts it\nin his History of the Concept of Time (a 1925 lecture course):\n\u201cNot \u2018time is\u2019, but \u2018Dasein qua time\ntemporalizes its Being\u2019\u2009\u201d (319). To make sense of this\ntemporalizing, Heidegger introduces the technical term\necstases. Ecstases are phenomena that stand out from an\nunderlying unity. (He later reinterprets ecstases as horizons,\nin the sense of what limits, surrounds or encloses, and in so doing\ndiscloses or makes available.) According to Heidegger, temporality is a\nunity against which past, present and future stand out as ecstases\nwhile remaining essentially interlocked. The importance of this idea is\nthat it frees the phenomenologist from thinking of past, present and\nfuture as sequentially ordered groupings of distinct events. Thus:\n\n\nTemporalizing does not signify that ecstases come in a\n\u2018succession\u2019. The future is not later than having been, and\nhaving-been is not earlier than the Present. Temporality temporalizes\nitself as a future which makes present in a process of having\nbeen. (Being and Time 68: 401) \n\n\nWhat does this mean and\nwhy should we find it compelling? Perhaps the easiest way to grasp\nHeidegger's insight here is to follow him in explicitly\nreinterpreting the different elements of the structure of care in terms\nof the three phenomenologically intertwined dimensions of temporality.\n\n\n\nDasein's existence is characterized phenomenologically by\nthrown projection plus fallenness/discourse. Heidegger argues that for\neach of these phenomena, one particular dimension of temporality is\nprimary. Thus projection is disclosed principally as the manner in\nwhich Dasein orients itself towards its future. Anticipation, as\nauthentic projection, therefore becomes the predominantly futural\naspect of (what we can now call) authentic temporalizing, whereas\nexpectation, as inauthentic projection, occupies the same role for\ninauthentic temporalizing. However, since temporality is at root a\nunitary structure, thrownness, projection, falling and discourse must\neach have a multi-faceted temporality. Anticipation, for example,\nrequires that Dasein acknowledge the unavoidable way in which its past\nis constitutive of who it is, precisely because anticipation demands of\nDasein that it project itself resolutely onto (i.e., come to make its\nown) one of the various options established by its cultural-historical\nembeddedness. And anticipation has a present-related aspect too: in a\nprocess that Heidegger calls a moment of vision, Dasein, in\nanticipating its own death, pulls away from they-self-dominated\ndistractions of the present.\n\n\nStructurally similar analyses are given for the other elements of\nthe care structure. Here is not the place to pursue the details but, at\nthe most general level, thrownness is identified predominantly,\nalthough not exclusively, as the manner in which Dasein collects up its\npast (finding itself in relation to the pre-structured field of\nintelligibility into which it has been enculturated), while fallen-ness\nand discourse are identified predominantly, although not exclusively,\nas present-oriented (e.g., in the case of fallen-ness, through\ncuriosity as a search for novelty in which Dasein is locked into the\ndistractions of the present and devalues the past and the projective\nfuture). A final feature of Heidegger's intricate analysis\nconcerns the way in which authentic and inauthentic temporalizing are\nunderstood as prioritizing different dimensions of temporality.\nHeidegger argues that because future-directed anticipation is\nintertwined with projection onto death as a possibility (thereby\nenabling the disclosure of Dasein's all-important finitude), the\n\u201cprimary phenomenon of primordial and authentic temporality is\nthe future\u201d (Being and Time 65: 378), whereas\ninauthentic temporalizing (through structures such as\n\u2018they\u2019-determined curiosity) prioritizes the\npresent.\n\nWhat the foregoing summary of Heidegger's account of\ntemporality makes clear is that each event of intelligibility that\nmakes up a \u2018moment\u2019 in Dasein's existence must be\nunpacked using all three temporal ecstases. Each such event is\nconstituted by thrownness (past), projection (future) and\nfalling/discourse (present). In a sense, then, each such event\ntranscends (goes beyond) itself as a momentary episode of Being by, in\nthe relevant sense, co-realizing a past and a future along with a\npresent. This explains why \u201cthe future is not later than having\nbeen, and having-been is not earlier than the Present\u201d. In the\nsense that matters, then, Dasein is always a combination of\nthe futural, the historical and the present. And since futurality,\nhistoricality and presence, understood in terms of projection,\nthrownness and fallenness/discourse, form the structural dimensions of\neach event of intelligibility, it is Dasein's essential\ntemporality (or temporalizing) that provides the a priori\ntranscendental condition for there to be care (the sense-making that\nconstitutes Dasein's own distinctive mode of Being).\n\n\n(Some worries about Heidegger's analysis of time will be\nexplored below. For a view which is influenced by, and contains an\noriginal interpretation of, Heidegger on time, see Stiegler's\n1996/2003 analysis according to which human temporality is constituted\nby technology, including alphabetical writing, as a form of\nmemory.)\n2.3.4 Historicality and Historizing\n\n\nIn the final major development of his analysis of temporality,\nHeidegger identifies a phenomenon that he calls Dasein's\nhistoricality, understood as the a priori condition on the\nbasis of which past events and things may have significance for us. The\nanalysis begins with an observation that Being-towards-death is only\none aspect of Dasein's finitude.\n[Death] is only the \u2018end\u2019 of Dasein; and, taken\nformally, it is just one of the ends by which Dasein's totality\nis closed round. The other \u2018end\u2019, however, is the\n\u2018beginning\u2019, the \u2018birth\u2019. Only that entity\nwhich is \u2018between\u2019 birth and death presents the whole which\nwe have been seeking\u2026 Dasein has [so far] been our theme only in\nthe way in which it exists \u2018facing forward\u2019, as it were,\nleaving \u2018behind\u2019 all that has been. Not only has\nBeing-towards-the-beginning remained unnoticed; but so too, and above\nall, has the way in which Dasein stretches along between birth and\ndeath. (Being and Time 72: 425).\n\n\nHere Dasein's beginning (its \u2018birth\u2019) is to be interpreted\nnot as a biological event, but as a moment of enculturation, following\nwhich the a priori structure underlying intelligibility (thrown\nprojection plus falling/discourse) applies.  Dasein's beginning is\nthus a moment at which a biological human being has become embedded\nwithin a pre-existing world, a culturally determined field of\nintelligibility into which it is thrown and onto which it projects\nitself. Such worlds are now to be reinterpreted historically as\nDasein's heritage. Echoing the way in which past, present and\nfuture were disclosed as intertwined in the analysis of temporality,\nDasein's historicality has the effect of bringing the past (its\nheritage) alive in the present as a set of opportunities for future\naction. In the original German, Heidegger calls this\nphenomenon Wiederholung, which Macquarrie and Robinson\ntranslate as repetition. Although this is an accurate\ntranslation of the German term, there is a way of hearing the word\n\u2018repetition\u2019 that is misleading with regard to Heidegger's\nusage. The idea here is not that I can do nothing other than repeat\nthe actions of my cultural ancestors, but rather that, in authentic\nmode, I may appropriate those past actions (own them, make them mine)\nas a set of general models or heroic templates onto which I may\ncreatively project myself. Thus, retrieving may be a more\nappropriate translation. This notion of retrieving characterizes the\n\u201cspecific movement in which Dasein is stretched along and\nstretches itself along\u201d, what Heidegger now calls Dasein's\nhistorizing. Historizing is an a priori structure of\nDasein's Being as care that constitutes a stretching along\nbetween Dasein's birth as the entity that takes-as and death as\nits end, between enculturation and finitude. \u201cFactical Dasein\nexists as born; and, as born, it is already dying, in the sense of\nBeing-towards-death\u2026 birth and death are \u2018connected\u2019\nin a manner characteristic of Dasein. As care, Dasein is the\n\u2018between\u2019\u2009\u201d(Being and Time 73: 426\u20137).\nIt is debatable whether the idea of creative appropriation does\nenough to allay the suspicion that the concept of heritage introduces a\nthreat to our individual freedom (in an ordinary sense of freedom) by\nway of some sort of social determinism. For example, since\nhistoricality is an aspect of Dasein's existential constitution,\nit is arguable that Heidegger effectively rules out the possibility\nthat I might reinvent myself in an entirely original way. Moreover,\nPolt (1999) draws our attention to a stinging passage from earlier in\nBeing and Time which might be taken to suggest that any\nattempt to take on board elements of cultures other than one's\nown should be judged an inauthentic practice indicative of fallen-ness.\nThus: \n\n\nthe opinion may now arise that understanding the most\nalien cultures and \u2018synthesizing\u2019 them with one's own\nmay lead to Dasein's becoming for the first time thoroughly and\ngenuinely enlightened about itself. Versatile curiosity and restlessly\n\u2018knowing it all\u2019 masquerade as a universal understanding of\nDasein. (Being and Time 38: 178)\n\n\n This sets the stage\nfor Heidegger's own final elucidation of human freedom. According\nto Heidegger, I am genuinely free precisely when I recognize that I am\na finite being with a heritage and when I achieve an authentic\nrelationship with that heritage through the creative appropriation of\nit. As he explains: \n\n\nOnce one has grasped the finitude of one's existence, it\nsnatches one back from the endless multiplicity of possibilities which\noffer themselves as closest to one\u2014those of comfortableness,\nshirking and taking things lightly\u2014and brings Dasein to the\nsimplicity of its fate. This is how we designate Dasein's\nprimordial historizing, which lies in authentic resoluteness and in\nwhich Dasein hands itself down to itself, free for death, in a\npossibility which it has inherited and yet has chosen.\n(Being and Time 74: 435)\n\n\nThis phenomenon, a final reinterpretation of the notion of\nresoluteness, is what Heidegger calls primordial historizing\nor fate. And crucially, historizing is not merely a structure\nthat is partly constitutive of individual authentic Dasein.\nHeidegger also points out the shared primordial historizing of a\ncommunity, what he calls its destiny.\n\n\nWhen the contemporary reader of Being and Time encounters\nthe concepts of heritage, fate and destiny, and places them not only in\nthe context of the political climate of mid-to-late 1920s Germany, but\nalso alongside Heidegger's later membership of the Nazi party, it\nis hard not to hear dark undertones of cultural chauvinism and racial\nprejudice. This worry becomes acute when one considers the way in which\nthese concepts figure in passages such as the following, from the\ninaugural rectoral address that Heidegger gave at Freiburg University\nin 1933.\n\n\nThe third bond [knowledge service, in addition to labour service\nand military service] is the one that binds the [German] students to\nthe spiritual mission of the German Volk. This Volk is playing an\nactive role in shaping its own fate by placing its history into the\nopenness of the overpowering might of all the world-shaping forces of\nhuman existence and by struggling anew to secure its spiritual\nworld\u2026 The three bonds\u2014through the Volk to the\ndestiny of the state in its spiritual mission\u2014are equally\noriginal aspects of the German essence. (The Self-Assertion of\nthe German University, 35\u20136)\n\n\nThe issue of Heidegger's later relationship with Nazi politics\nand ideology will be discussed briefly below. For the moment, however,\nit is worth saying that the temptation to offer extreme social\ndeterminist or Nazi reconstructions of Being and Time is far\nfrom irresistible. It is at least arguable that Heidegger's claim\nat this point in his work is \u2018merely\u2019 that it is only on\nthe basis of fate\u2014an honest and explicit retrieval of my own\nculture which allows me to recognize and accept the manifold ways in\nwhich I am shaped by that culture\u2014that I can open up a genuine\npath to personal reconstruction or to the possibly enriching structures\nthat other cultures have to offer. And that does not sound nearly so\npernicious. \n2.4 Realism and Relativism in Being and Time\n\n\nOne might think that an unpalatable relativism is entailed by any\nview which emphasizes that understanding is never preconception-free.\nBut that would be too quick. Of course, if authentic Dasein were\nindividualized in the sense of being a self-sufficient Cartesian\nsubject, then perhaps an extreme form of subjectivist relativism would\nindeed beckon. Fortunately, however, authentic Dasein isn't a\nCartesian subject, in part because it has a transformed and not a\nsevered relationship with the \u2018they\u2019. This reconnects us\nwith our earlier remark that the philosophical framework advocated\nwithin Being and Time appears to mandate a kind of\ncultural relativism. This seems right, but it is important to\ntry to understand precisely what sort of cultural relativism is on\noffer. Here is one interpretation.\n\n\nAlthough worlds (networks of involvements, what Heidegger sometimes\ncalls Reality) are culturally relative phenomena, Heidegger\noccasionally seems to suggest that nature, as it is in itself,\nis not. Thus, on the one hand, nature may be discovered as\nready-to-hand equipment: the \u201cwood is a forest of timber, the\nmountain is a quarry of rock; the river is water-power, the wind is\nwind \u2018in the sails\u2019\u2009\u201d (Being and Time 15:\n100). Under these circumstances, nature is revealed in certain\nculturally specific forms determined by our socially conditioned\npatterns of skilled practical activity. On the other hand, when nature\nis discovered as present-at-hand, by say science, its intelligibility\nhas an essentially cross-cultural character. Indeed, Heidegger often\nseems to hold the largely commonsense view that there are\nculture-independent causal properties of nature which explain why it is\nthat you can make missiles out of rocks or branches, but not out of air\nor water. Science can tell us both what those causal properties are,\nand how the underlying causal processes work. Such properties and\nprocesses are what Heidegger calls the Real, and he comments:\n\u201c[the] fact that Reality [intelligibility] is ontologically\ngrounded in the Being of Dasein does not signify that only when Dasein\nexists and as long as Dasein exists can the Real [e.g., nature as\nrevealed by science] be as that which in itself it is\u201d\n(Being and Time, 43: 255). \n\n\nIf the picture just sketched is a productive way to understand\nHeidegger, then, perhaps surprisingly, his position might best be\nthought of as a mild kind of scientific realism. For, on this\ninterpretation, one of Dasein's cultural practices, the practice\nof science, has the special quality of revealing natural entities as\nthey are in themselves, that is, independently of Dasein's\nculturally conditioned uses and articulations of them. Crucially,\nhowever, this sort of scientific realism maintains ample conceptual\nroom for Sheehan's well-observed point that, for Heidegger, at\nevery stage of his thinking, \u201cthere is no \u2018is\u2019 to\nthings without a taking-as\u2026 no sense that is independent of\nhuman being\u2026 Before homo sapiens evolved, there was no\n\u2018being\u2019 on earth\u2026 because \u2018being\u2019 for\nHeidegger does not mean \u2018in existence\u2019\u2009\u201d (Sheehan\n2001). Indeed, Being concerns sense-making (intelligibility), and the\ndifferent ways in which entities make sense to us, including as\npresent-at-hand, are dependent on the fact that we are Dasein,\ncreatures with a particular mode of Being. So while natural entities do\nnot require the existence of Dasein in order just to occur (in an\nordinary, straightforward sense of \u2018occur\u2019), they do\nrequire Dasein in order to be intelligible at all, including\nas entities that just occur. Understood properly, then, the\nfollowing two claims that Heidegger makes are entirely consistent with\neach other. First: \u201cBeing (not entities) is dependent upon the\nunderstanding of Being; that is to say, Reality (not the Real) is\ndependent upon care\u201d. Secondly: \u201c[O]nly as long as Dasein\nis (that is, only as long as an understanding of Being is ontically\npossible), \u2018is there\u2019 Being. When Dasein does not exist,\n\u2018independence\u2019 \u2018is\u2019 not either, nor\n\u2018is\u2019 the \u2018in-itself\u2019\u2009\u201d. (Both quotations\nfrom Being and Time, 43: 255.)\n\n\nHow does all this relate to Heidegger's account of truth?\nAnswering this question adds a new dimension to the pivotal phenomenon\nof revealing. Heidegger points out that the philosophical tradition\nstandardly conceives of truth as attaching to propositions, and as\ninvolving some sort of correspondence between propositions and states\nof affairs. But whereas for the tradition (as Heidegger characterizes\nit), propositional truth as correspondence exhausts the phenomenon of\ntruth, for Heidegger, it is merely the particular manifestation of\ntruth that is operative in those domains, such as science, that concern\nthemselves with the Real. According to Heidegger, propositional truth\nas correspondence is made possible by a more fundamental phenomenon\nthat he dubs \u2018original truth\u2019. Heidegger's key\nthought here is that before (in a conceptual sense of\n\u2018before\u2019) there can be any question of correspondence\nbetween propositions and states of affairs, there needs to be in place\na field of intelligibility (Reality, a world), a sense-making structure\nwithin which entities may be found. Unconcealing is the\nDasein-involving process that establishes this prior field of\nintelligibility. This is the domain of original truth\u2014what we\nmight call truth as revealing or truth as\nunconcealing. Original truth cannot be reduced to propositional\ntruth as correspondence, because the former is an a priori,\ntranscendental condition for the latter. Of course, since Dasein is the\nsource of intelligibility, truth as unconcealing is possible only\nbecause there is Dasein, which means that without Dasein there would be\nno truth\u2014including propositional truth as correspondence. But\nit is reasonable to hear this seemingly relativistic consequence as a\nfurther modulation of the point (see above) that entities require\nDasein in order to be intelligible at all, including, now, as entities\nthat are capable of entering into states of affairs that may correspond\nto propositions.\n\n\nHeidegger's analysis of truth also countenances a third\nmanifestation of the phenomenon, one that is perhaps best characterized\nas being located between original truth and propositional\ntruth. This intermediate phenomenon is what might be called\nHeidegger's instrumental notion of truth (Dahlstrom\n2001, Overgaard 2002). As we saw earlier, for Heidegger, the\nreferential structure of significance may be articulated not only by\nwords but by skilled practical activity (e.g., hammering) in which items\nof equipment are used in culturally appropriate ways. By\nHeidegger's lights, such equipmental activity counts as a\nmanifestation of unconcealing and thus as the realization of a species\nof truth. This fact further threatens the idea that truth attaches only\nto propositions, although some uses of language may themselves be\nanalysed as realizing the instrumental form of truth (e.g., when I\nexclaim that \u2018this hammer is too heavy for the job\u2019, rather\nthan assert that it has the objective property of weighing 2.5 kilos;\nOvergaard 2002, 77; cf. Being and Time 33:199\u2013200).\n\n\nIt is at this point that an ongoing dispute in Heidegger scholarship\ncomes to the fore. It has been argued (e.g., Dahlstrom 2001, Overgaard\n2002) that a number of prominent readings of Heidegger (e.g., Okrent\n1988, Dreyfus 1991) place such heavy philosophical emphasis on Dasein\nas a site of skilled practical activity that they end up simply\nidentifying Dasein's understanding of Being with skilled\npractical activity. Because of this shared tendency, such readings are\noften grouped together as advocating a pragmatist\ninterpretation of Heidegger. According to its critics, the inadequacy\nof the pragmatist interpretation is exposed once it is applied to\nHeidegger's account of truth. For although the pragmatist\ninterpretation correctly recognizes that, for Heidegger, propositional\ncorrespondence is not the most fundamental phenomenon of truth, it\ntakes the fundamental variety to be exhausted by Dasein's\nsense-making skilled practical activity. But (the critic points out)\nthis is to ignore the fact that even though instrumental truth is more\nbasic than traditional propositional truth, nevertheless it too depends\non a prior field of significance (one that determines the correct and\nincorrect uses of equipment) and thus on the phenomenon of original\ntruth. Put another way, the pragmatist interpretation falls short\nbecause it fails to distinguish original truth from instrumental truth.\nIt is worth commenting here that not every so-called pragmatist reading\nis on a par with respect to this issue. For example, Dreyfus (2008)\nseparates out (what he calls) background coping\n(Dasein's familiarity with, and knowledge of how to navigate the meaningful structures of,\nits world) from (what he calls) skilled or absorbed\ncoping (Dasein's skilled practical activity), and argues that,\nfor Heidegger, the former is ontologically more basic than the latter.\nIf original truth is manifested in background coping, and instrumental\ntruth in skilled coping, this disrupts the thought that the two notions\nof truth are being run together (for discussion, see Overgaard 2002\n85\u20136, note 17).\n\n\nHow should one respond to Heidegger's analysis of truth?\nOne objection is that original truth ultimately fails to qualify as a\nform of truth at all. As Tugendhat (1967) observes, it is a plausible\ncondition on the acceptability of any proposed account of truth that it\naccommodate a distinction between what is asserted or intended and how\nthings are in themselves. It is clear that propositional truth as\ncorrespondence satisfies this condition, and notice that (if we squint\na little) so too does instrumental truth, since despite my intentions,\nI can fail, in my actions, to use the hammer in ways that successfully\narticulate its place in the relevant equipmental network. However, as\nTugendhat argues, it is genuinely hard to see how original truth as\nunconcealing could possibly support a distinction between what is\nasserted or intended and how things are in themselves. After all,\nunconcealing is, in part, the process through which entities are made\nintelligible to Dasein in such a way that the distinction in question\ncan apply. Thus, Tugendhat concludes, although unconcealing may be a\ngenuine phenomenon that constitutes a transcendental condition for\nthere to be truth, it is not itself a species of truth. (For\ndiscussions of Tugendhat's critique, see Dahlstrom 2001,\nOvergaard 2002.)\n\n\nWhether or not unconcealing ought to count as a species of truth,\nit is arguable that the place which it (along with its partner\nstructure, Reality) occupies in the Heideggerian framework must\nultimately threaten even the mild kind of scientific realism that we\nhave been attributing, somewhat tentatively, to Heidegger. The tension\ncomes into view just at the point where unconcealing is reinterpreted\nin terms of Dasein's essential historicality. Because\nintelligibility, and thus unconcealing, has an essentially historical\ncharacter, it is difficult to resist the thought that the propositional\nand instrumental truths generated out of some specific field of\nintelligibility will be relativistically tied to a particular culture\nin a particular time period. Moreover, at one point, Heidegger suggests\nthat even truth as revealed by science is itself subject to this kind\nof relativistic constraint. Thus he says that \u201cevery factical\nscience is always manifestly in the grip of historizing\u201d\n(Being and Time 76: 444). The implication is that, for\nHeidegger, one cannot straightforwardly subject the truth of one age to\nthe standards of another, which means, for example, that contemporary\nchemistry and alchemical chemistry might both be true (cf. Dreyfus\n1990, 261\u20132). But even if this more radical position is ultimately\nHeidegger's, there remains space here for some form of realism.\nGiven the transcendental relation that, according to Heidegger, obtains\nbetween fields of intelligibility and science, the view on offer might\nstill support a historically conditioned form of Kantian empirical\nrealism with respect to science. Nevertheless it must, it seems, reject\nthe full-on scientific realist commitment to the idea that the history\nof science is regulated by progress towards some final and unassailable\nset of scientifically established truths about nature, by a journey\ntowards, as it were, God's science (Haugeland 2007).\nThe realist waters in which our preliminary interpretation has been\nswimming are muddied even further by another aspect of Dasein's\nessential historicality. Officially, it is seemingly not supposed to be\na consequence of that historicality that we cannot discover universal\nfeatures of ourselves. The evidence for this is that there are many\nconclusions reached in Being and Time that putatively apply to\nall Dasein, for example that Dasein's everyday experience is\ncharacterized by the structural domains of readiness-to-hand,\nun-readiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand (for additional evidence, see\nPolt 1999 92\u20134). Moreover, Heidegger isn't saying that any route\nto understanding is as good as any other. For example, he prioritizes\nauthenticity as the road to an answer to the question of the meaning of\nBeing. Thus:\n\nthe idea of existence, which guides us as that\nwhich we see in advance, has been made definite [transformed from\npre-ontological to ontological, from implicit and vague to explicitly\narticulated] by the clarification of our ownmost\npotentiality-for-Being. (Being and Time 63: 358)\n\n\n Still,\nif this priority claim and the features shared by all Dasein really are\nsupposed to be ahistorical, universal conditions (applicable everywhere\nthroughout history), we are seemingly owed an account of just how such\nconditions are even possible, given Dasein's essential\nhistoricality.\n\n\nFinally, one might wonder whether the \u2018realist\nHeidegger\u2019 can live with the account of temporality given in\nBeing and Time. If temporality is the a priori condition for\nus to encounter entities as equipment, and if, in the relevant sense,\nthe unfolding of time coincides with the unfolding of Dasein (Dasein,\nas temporality, temporalizes; see above), then equipmental entities\nwill be intelligible to us only in (what we might call) Dasein-time,\nthe time that we ourselves are. Now, we have seen previously that\nnature is often encountered as equipment, which means that natural\nequipment will be intelligible to us only in Dasein-time. But what\nabout nature in a non-equipmental form\u2014nature (as one might\nsurely be tempted to say) as it is in itself? One might try to argue\nthat those encounters with nature that reveal nature as it is in itself\nare precisely those encounters that reveal nature as present-at-hand,\nand that to reveal nature as present-at-hand is, in part, to reveal\nnature within present-at-hand time (e.g., clock time), a time which is,\nin the relevant sense, independent of Dasein. Unfortunately\nthere's a snag with this story (and thus for the attempt to see\nHeidegger as a realist). Heidegger claims that presence-at-hand (as\nrevealed by theoretical reflection) is subject to the same\nDasein-dependent temporality as readiness-to-hand: \n\n\n\u2026if\nDasein's Being is completely grounded in temporality, then\ntemporality must make possible Being-in-the-world and therewith\nDasein's transcendence; this transcendence in turn provides the\nsupport for concernful Being alongside entities within-the-world,\nwhether this Being is theoretical or practical.\n(Being and Time 69: 415, my emphasis)\n\n\n But now if theoretical\ninvestigations reveal nature in present-at-hand time, and if in the\nswitching over from the practical use of equipment to the theoretical\ninvestigation of objects, time remains the same Dasein-time, then\npresent-at-hand time is Dasein-dependent too. Given this, it seems that\nthe only way we can give any sense to the idea of nature as it is in\nitself is to conceive of such nature as being outside of time.\nInterestingly, in the History of the Concept of Time (a text\nbased on Heidegger's notes for a 1925 lecture course and often\nthought of as a draft of Being and Time), Heidegger seems to\nembrace this very option, arguing that nature is within time only when\nit is encountered in Dasein's world, and concluding that nature\nas it is in itself is entirely atemporal. It is worth noting the\nsomewhat Kantian implication of this conclusion: if all understanding\nis grounded in temporality, then the atemporality of nature as it is in\nitself would mean that, for Heidegger, we cannot understand natural\nthings as they really are in themselves (cf. Dostal 1993).\n3. The Later Philosophy\n3.1 The Turn and the Contributions to Philosophy\n\n\nAfter Being and Time there is a shift in Heidegger's\nthinking that he himself christened \u2018the turn\u2019 (die\nKehre). In a 1947 piece, in which Heidegger distances his views\nfrom Sartre's existentialism, he links the turn to his own\nfailure to produce the missing divisions of Being and\nTime. \n\n\nThe adequate execution and completion of this other thinking that\nabandons subjectivity is surely made more difficult by the fact that in\nthe publication of Being and Time the third division of the\nfirst part, \u201cTime and Being,\u201d was held back\u2026 Here\neverything is reversed. The division in question was held back because\neverything failed in the adequate saying of this turning and did not\nsucceed with the help of the language of metaphysics\u2026 This\nturning is not a change of standpoint from Being and Time, but\nin it the thinking that was sought first arrives at the location of\nthat dimension out of which Being and Time is experienced,\nthat is to say, experienced from the fundamental experience of the\noblivion of Being. (Letter on Humanism, pp.\u00a0231\u20132)\n\n\n\nNotice that while, in the turning, \u201ceverything is\nreversed\u201d, nevertheless it is \u201cnot a change of standpoint\nfrom Being and Time\u201d, so what we should expect from the\nlater philosophy is a pattern of significant discontinuities with\nBeing and Time, interpretable from within a basic project and\na set of concerns familiar from that earlier text. The quotation from\nthe Letter on Humanism provides some clues about what to look\nfor. Clearly we need to understand what is meant by the abandonment of\nsubjectivity, what kind of barrier is erected by the language of\nmetaphysics, and what is involved in the oblivion of Being. The second\nand third of these issues will be clarified later. The first bears\nimmediate comment.\n\n\nAt root Heidegger's later philosophy shares the deep concerns\nof Being and Time, in that it is driven by the same\npreoccupation with Being and our relationship with it that propelled\nthe earlier work. In a fundamental sense, then, the question of Being\nremains the question. However, Being and Time\naddresses the question of Being via an investigation of Dasein, the\nkind of being whose Being is an issue for it. As we have seen, this\ninvestigation takes the form of a transcendental hermeneutic\nphenomenology that begins with ordinary human experience. It is\narguable that, in at least one important sense, it is this\nphilosophical methodology that the later Heidegger is rejecting when he\ntalks of his abandonment of subjectivity. Of course, as conceptualized\nin Being and Time, Dasein is not a Cartesian subject, so the\nabandonment of subjectivity is not as simple as a shift of attention\naway from Dasein and towards some other route to Being. Nevertheless\nthe later Heidegger does seem to think that his earlier focus on Dasein\nbears the stain of a subjectivity that ultimately blocks the path to an\nunderstanding of Being. This is not to say that the later thinking\nturns away altogether from the project of transcendental hermeneutic\nphenomenology. The project of illuminating the a priori conditions on\nthe basis of which entities show up as intelligible to us is still at\nthe heart of things. What the later thinking involves is a\nreorientation of the basic project so that, as we shall see, the point\nof departure is no longer a detailed description of ordinary human\nexperience. (For an analysis of \u2018the turn\u2019 that identifies\na number of different senses of the term at work in Heidegger's\nthinking, and which in some ways departs from the brief treatment given\nhere, see Sheehan 2010.)\n\n\n\nA further difficulty in getting to grips with Heidegger's\nlater philosophy is that, unlike the early thought, which is heavily\ncentred on a single text, the later thought is distributed over a large\nnumber and range of works, including books, lecture courses, occasional\naddresses, and presentations given to non-academic audiences. So one\nneeds a navigational strategy. The strategy adopted here will be to\nview the later philosophy through the lens of Heidegger's strange\nand perplexing study from the 1930s called Contributions to\nPhilosophy (From Enowning), (Beitrage zur Philosophie (Vom\nEreignis)), henceforth referred to as the Contributions.\n(For a book-length introduction to the Contributions, see\nVallega-Neu 2003. For a useful collection of papers, see Scott et al.\n2001.) The key themes that shape the later philosophy will be\nidentified in the Contributions, but those themes will be\nexplored in a way that draws on, and make connections with, a selection\nof other works. From this partial expedition, the general pattern of\nHeidegger's post-turn thinking, although not every aspect of it,\nwill emerge.\n\n\nThe Contributions was written between 1936 and 1938.\nIntriguingly, Heidegger asked for the work not to appear in print until\nafter the publication of all his lecture courses, and although his\ndemand wasn't quite heeded by the editors of his collected works,\nthe Contributions was not published in German until 1989 and\nnot in English until 1999. To court a perhaps overly dramatic telling\nof Heideggerian history, if one puts a lot of weight on\nHeidegger's view of when the Contributions should have\nbeen published, one might conceivably think of those later writings\nthat, in terms of when they were produced, followed the\nContributions as something like the training material needed\nto understand the earlier work (see e.g., Polt 1999 140). In any case,\nduring his lifetime, Heidegger showed the Contributions to no\nmore than a few close colleagues. The excitement with which the\neventual publication of the text was greeted by Heidegger's\nreaders was partly down to the fact that one of the chosen few granted\na sneak preview was the influential interpreter of Heidegger, Otto\nP\u00f6ggeler, who then proceeded to give it some rather extraordinary\nadvance publicity, describing it as the work in which Heidegger's\ngenuine and complete thinking is captured (see e.g., P\u00f6ggeler\n1963/1987).\n\n\nWhether or not the hype surrounding the Contributions was\njustified remains a debated question among Heidegger scholars (see e.g.,\nSheehan 2001, Thomson 2003). What is clear, however, is that reading\nthe work is occasionally a bewildering experience. Rather than a series\nof systematic hermeneutic spirals in the manner of Being and\nTime, the Contributions is organised as something like a\nmusical fugue, that is, as a suite of overlapping developments of a\nsingle main theme (Schoenbohm 2001; Thomson 2003). And while the\nstructure of the Contributions is challenging enough, the\nlanguage in which it is written can appear to be wilfully obscurantist.\nPolt (1999, 140) comments that \u201cthe most important sections of\nthe text can appear to be written in pure Heideggerese\u2026 [as\nHeidegger] exploits the sounds and senses of German in order to create\nan idiosyncratic symphony of meanings\u201d. Less charitably, Sheehan\n(2001) describes it as \u201ca needlessly difficult text, obsessively\nrepetitious, badly in need of an editor\u201d, while Schurmann (1992,\n313, quoted by Thomson 2003, 57) complains that \u201cat times one may\nthink one is reading a piece of Heideggerian plagiarism, so encumbered\nis it with ellipses and assertoric monoliths\u201d. Arguably, the\nstyle in which the Contributions is written is\n\u2018merely\u2019 the most extreme example (perhaps, the purest\nexample) of a \u2018poetic\u2019 style that Heidegger adopts pretty\nmuch throughout the later philosophy. This stylistic aspect of the turn\nis an issue discussed below. For the moment, however, it is worth\nnoting that, in the stylistic transition achieved in the\nContributions, Heidegger's writing finally leaves\nbehind all vestiges of the idea that Being can be represented\naccurately using some pseudo-scientific philosophical language.\nThe goal, instead, is to respond appropriately to Being\nin language, to forge a pathway to another kind of thinking\u2014Being-historical thinking (for discussion of this\nterm, see Vallega 2001, von Herrmann 2001, Vallega-Neu 2003, 28-9). In\nits attempt to achieve this, the Contributions may be viewed\nas setting the agenda for Heidegger's post-turn thought. So what\nare the central themes that appear in the Contributions and\nwhich then resonate throughout the later works? Four stand out: Being\nas appropriation (an idea which, as we shall see, is bound up with a\nreinterpretation of the notion of dwelling that, in terms of explicit\ntextual development, takes place largely outwith the text of the\nContributions itself); technology (or machination);\nsafeguarding (or sheltering); and the gods. Each of these themes will\nnow be explored.\n3.2 Appropriation, Dwelling and the Fourfold\n\n\nIn Being and Time, the most fundamental a priori\ntranscendental condition for there to be Dasein's distinctive\nmode of Being which is identified is temporality. In the later\nphilosophy, the ontological focus ultimately shifts to the claim that\nhuman Being consists most fundamentally in dwelling. This shift of\nattention emerges out of a subtle reformulation of the question of\nBeing itself, a reformulation performed in the Contributions.\nThe question now becomes not \u2018What is the meaning of\nBeing?\u2019 but rather \u2018How does Being essentially\nunfold?\u2019. This reformulation means (in a way that should become\nclearer in a moment) that we are now asking the question of Being not\nfrom the perspective of Dasein, but from the perspective of Being (see\nabove on abandoning subjectivity). But it also suggests that Being\nneeds to be understood as fundamentally a timebound, historical\nprocess. As Heidegger puts it: \u201cA being is: Be-ing holds\nsway [unfolds]\u201d. (Contributions 10: 22. Quotations from\nthe Contributions will be given in the form \u2018section: page\nnumber\u2019 where \u2018page number\u2019 refers to the Emad and\nMaly English translation. The hyphenated term \u2018be-ing\u2019 is\nadopted by Emad and Maly, in order to respect the fact that, in the\nContributions, Heidegger substitutes the archaic spelling\n\u2018Seyn\u2019 for the contemporary \u2018Sein\u2019 as a way of\ndistancing himself further from the traditional language of\nmetaphysics. This translational convention, which has not become\nstandard practice in the secondary literature, will not be adopted\nhere, except in quotations from the Emad and Maly\ntranslation.)\n\n\nFurther aspects of the essential unfolding of Being are revealed by\nwhat is perhaps the key move in the Contributions\u2014a\nrethinking of Being in terms of the notion of Ereignis, a term\ntranslated variously as \u2018event\u2019 (most closely reflecting\nits ordinary German usage), \u2018appropriation\u2019,\n\u2018appropriating event\u2019, \u2018event of appropriation\u2019\nor \u2018enowning\u2019. (For an analysis which tracks\nHeidegger's use of the term Ereignis at various stages\nof his thought, see Vallega-Neu 2010). The history of Being is now\nconceived as a series of appropriating events in which the different\ndimensions of human sense-making\u2014the religious, political,\nphilosophical (and so on) dimensions that define the culturally\nconditioned epochs of human history\u2014are transformed. Each such\ntransformation is a revolution in human patterns of intelligibility, so\nwhat is appropriated in the event is Dasein and thus the human capacity\nfor taking-as (see e.g., Contributions 271: 343). Once\nappropriated in this way, Dasein operates according to a specific set\nof established sense-making practices and structures. In a Kuhnian\nregister, one might think of this as the normal sense-making that\nfollows a paradigm-shift. But now what is it that does the\nappropriating? Heidegger's answer to this question is Being. Thus\nHeidegger writes of the \u201cEn-ownment [appropriation] of Da-sein by\nbe-ing\u201d (Contributions 141: 184) and of \u201cman as\nowned by be-ing\u201d (Contributions 141: 185). Indeed,\nthis appropriation of Dasein by Being is what enables Being to unfold:\n\u201cBe-ing needs man in order to hold sway [unfold]\u201d\n(Contributions 133: 177). The claim that Being appropriates\nDasein might seem to invite the adoption of an ethereal voice and a\nfar-off look in the eye, but any such temptation towards mysticism of\nthis kind really ought to be resisted. The mystical reading seems to\ndepend on a view according to which \u201cbe-ing holds sway \u2018for\nitself\u2019\u2009\u201d and Dasein \u201ctakes up the relating to\nbe-ing\u201d, such that Being is \u201csomething over-against\u201d\nDasein (Contributions 135: 179). But Heidegger argues that\nthis relational view would be \u2018misleading\u2019. That said, to\nmake proper inroads into the mystical reading, we need to reacquaint\nourselves with the notion of dwelling.\n\n\nAs we have seen, the term \u2018dwelling\u2019 appears in\nBeing and Time, where it is used to capture the distinctive\nmanner in which Dasein is in the world. The term continues to\nplay this role in the later philosophy, but, in texts such as\nBuilding Dwelling, Thinking (1954), it is reinterpreted and\nmade philosophically central to our understanding of Being. This\nreinterpretation of, and the new emphasis on, dwelling is bound up with\nthe idea from the Contributions of Being as appropriation. To\nexplain: Where one dwells is where one is at home, where one\nhas a place. This sense of place is what grounds\nHeidegger's existential notion of spatiality, as developed in the\nlater philosophy (see Malpas 2006). In dwelling, then, Dasein is\nlocated within a set of sense-making practices and structures with\nwhich it is familiar. This way of unravelling the phenomenon of\ndwelling enables us to see more clearly\u2014and more concretely\u2014what is meant by the idea of Being as event/appropriation.\nBeing is an event in that it takes (appropriates)\nplace (where one is at home, one's sense-making\npractices and structures) (cf. Polt 1999 148). In other words, Being\nappropriates Dasein in that, in its unfolding, it essentially\nhappens in and to Dasein's patterns of sense-making.\nThis way of thinking about the process of appropriation does rather\nless to invite obscurantist mysticism.\n\n\n\nThe reinterpretation of dwelling in terms of Being as appropriation\nis ultimately intertwined with a closely related reinterpretation of\nwhat is meant by a world. One can see the latter development in a\npregnant passage from Heidegger's 1954 piece, Building\nDwelling Thinking.\n\n\n[H]uman being consists in dwelling and, indeed, dwelling in the\nsense of the stay of mortals on the earth.\n\n But \u2018on the earth\u2019 already means \u2018under the\nsky.\u2019 Both of these also mean \u2018remaining before the\ndivinities\u2019 and include a \u2018belonging to men's being with\none another.\u2019 By a primal oneness the four\u2014earth and sky,\ndivinities and mortals\u2014belong together in one. (351)\n\n\n\nSo, human beings dwell in that they stay (are at home) on the earth,\nunder the sky, before the divinities, and among the mortals (that is,\nwith one another as mortals). It is important for Heidegger that these\ndimensions of dwelling are conceived not as independent structures but\nas (to use a piece of terminology from Being and Time)\necstases\u2014phenomena that stand out from an underlying\nunity. That underlying unity of earth, sky, divinities and mortals\u2014the \u2018simple oneness of the four\u2019 as Heidegger puts\nit in Building Dwelling Thinking (351)\u2014is what he\ncalls the fourfold. The fourfold is the transformed\nnotion of world that applies within the later work (see e.g., The\nThing; for an analysis of the fourfold that concentrates on its\nrole as a thinking of things, see Mitchell 2010). It is possible to\nglimpse the character of the world-as-fourfold by noting that whereas\nthe world as understood through Being and Time is a culturally\nconditioned structure distinct from nature, the world-as-fourfold\nappears to be an integrated combination of nature (earth and sky) and\nculture (divinities and mortals). (Two remarks: First, it may not be\nobvious why the divinities count as part of culture. This will be\nexplained in a moment. Secondly, the later Heidegger sometimes\ncontinues to employ the sense of world that he established in Being\nand Time, which is why it is useful to signal the new usage as the\ntransformed notion of world, or as the world-as-fourfold.)\n\n\nThere is something useful, as a preliminary move, about interpreting\nthe fourfold as a combination of nature and culture, but it is an idea\nthat must be handled with care. For one thing, if what is meant by\nnature is the material world and its phenomena as understood by natural\nscience, then Heidegger's account of the fourfold tells against\nany straightforward identification of earth and sky with nature. Why\nthis is becomes clear once one sees how Heidegger describes the earth\nand the sky in Building Dwelling Thinking. \u201cEarth is the\nserving bearer, blossoming and fruiting, spreading out in rock and\nwater, rising up into plant and animal\u2026 The sky is the vaulting\npath of the sun, the course of the changing moon, the wandering glitter\nof the stars, the year's seasons and their changes, the light and\ndusk of day, the gloom and glow of night, the clemency and inclemency\nof the weather, the drifting clouds and blue depth of the ether\u201d\n(351). What Heidegger's language here indicates is that the\nearth-as-dwelt-on and the sky-as-dwelt-under are spaces for a mode of\nhabitation by human beings that one might call poetic rather\nthan scientific. So, the nature of dwelling is the nature of the poet.\nIn dwelling we inhabit the poetic (for discussion, see e.g., Young 2002,\n99\u2013100).\n\n\nHow does this idea of dwelling as poetic habitation work for the\ncultural aspects of the fourfold\u2014dwelling among the mortals and\nbefore the divinities? To dwell among the mortals is to be\n\u201ccapable of death as death\u201d (Building Dwelling\nThinking 352). In the language of Being and Time, this\nwould be to enter into an authentic and thus non-evasive relationship\nwith death (see above). However, as we shall see in a moment, the later\nHeidegger has a different account of the nothing and thus of the\ninternal relation with the nothing that death involves. It is this\nreworking of the idea of the nothing that ultimately marks out a newly\nconceived non-evasive relationship with death as an aspect of dwelling,\nunderstood in terms of poetic habitation. The notion of dwelling before\nthe divinities also turns on the development of a theme established in\nBeing and Time, namely that intelligibility is itself cultural\nand historical in character. More specifically, according to Being\nand Time, the a priori transcendental conditions for\nintelligibility are to be interpreted in terms of the phenomenon of\nheritage, that is as culturally determined structures that form\npre-existing fields of intelligibility into which individual human\nbeings are thrown and onto which they project themselves. A key aspect\nof this idea is that there exist historically important individuals who\nconstitute heroic cultural templates onto which I may now creatively\nproject myself. In the later philosophy these heroic figures are reborn\npoetically as the divinities of the fourfold, as \u201cthe ones to\ncome\u201d (Contributions 248\u201352: 277\u201381), and as the\n\u201cbeckoning messengers of the godhead\u201d (Building\nDwelling Thinking 351). When Heidegger famously announces that\nonly a god can save us (Only a God can Save Us),\nor that \u201cthe last god is not the end but the other beginning of\nimmeasurable possibilities for our history\u201d\n(Contributions 256: 289), he has in mind not a religious\nintervention in an \u2018ordinary\u2019 sense of the divine, but\nrather a transformational event in which a secularized sense of the\nsacred\u2014a sensitivity to the fact that beings are\ngranted to us in the essential unfolding of Being\u2014is\nrestored (more on this below).\n\n\nThe notion of dwelling as poetic habitation opens up a path to what\nHeidegger calls \u2018the mystery\u2019 (not to be confused with the\nkind of obscurantist mysticism discussed above). Even though the world\nalways opens up as meaningful in a particular way to any individual\nhuman being as a result of the specific heritage into which he or she\nhas been enculturated, there are of course a vast number of alternative\nfields of intelligibility \u2018out there\u2019 that would be\navailable to each of us, if only we could gain access to them\nby becoming simultaneously embedded in different heritages. But\nHeidegger's account of human existence means that any such\nparallel embedding is ruled out, so the plenitude of alternative fields\nof intelligibility must remain a mystery to us. In\nHeidegger's later philosophy this mysterious region of Being\nemerges as a structure that, although not illuminated poetically in\ndwelling as a particular world-as-fourfold, nevertheless constitutes an\nessential aspect of dwelling in that it is ontologically co-present\nwith any such world. Appropriation is necessarily a twofold event: as\nDasein is thrown into an intelligible world, vast regions of Being are\nplunged into darkness. But that darkness is a necessary condition for\nthere to be any intelligibility at all. As Heidegger puts it in The\nQuestion Concerning Technology (330), \u201c[a]ll revealing\nbelongs within a harboring and a concealing. But that which frees\n[entities for intelligibility]\u2014the mystery\u2014is concealed\nand always concealing itself\u2026. Freedom [sense-making, the\nrevealing of beings] is that which conceals in a way that opens to\nlight, in whose clearing shimmers the veil that hides the essential\noccurrence of all truth and lets the veil appear as what\nveils\u201d.\n\n\nIt is worth pausing here to comment on the fact that, in his 1935\nessay The Origin of the Work of Art, Heidegger writes of a\nconflict between earth and world. This idea may seem to sit\nunhappily alongside the simple oneness of the four. The essay in\nquestion is notoriously difficult, but the notion of the mystery may\nhelp. Perhaps the pivotal thought is as follows: Natural materials (the\nearth), as used in artworks, enter into intelligibility by establishing\ncertain culturally codified meanings\u2014a world in the sense of\nBeing and Time. Simultaneously, however, those natural\nmaterials suggest the existence of a vast range of other possible, but\nto us unintelligible, meanings, by virtue of the fact that they\ncould have been used to realize those alternative meanings.\nThe conflict, then, turns on the way in which, in the midst of a world,\nthe earth suggests the presence of the mystery. This is one way to hear\npassages such as the following: \u201cThe world, in resting upon the\nearth, strives to surmount it. As self-opening it cannot endure\nanything closed. The earth, however, as sheltering and concealing,\ntends always to draw the world into itself and keep it there\u201d\n(Origin of the Work of Art 174).\n\n\nBecause the mystery is unintelligible, it is the nothing\n(no-thing). It is nonetheless a positive ontological\nphenomenon\u2014a necessary feature of the essential unfolding of\nBeing. This vision of the nothing, as developed in Heidegger's\nWhat is Metaphysics?, his 1929 inaugural lecture as Professor\nof Philosophy at Freiburg, famously attracts the philosophical disdain\nof the logical positivist Carnap. Carnap judged Heidegger's\nlecture to turn on a series of unverifiable statements, and thus to be\na paradigm case of metaphysical nonsense (Carnap 1932/1959; for a nice\naccount and analysis of the disagreement between Heidegger and Carnap,\nsee Critchley 2001). But placing Carnap's positivist critique to\none side, the idea of the nothing allows Heidegger to rethink our\nrelationship with death in relation to poetic habitation. In Being\nand Time, Being-towards-death is conceived as a relation to the\npossibility of one's own non-existence. This gives us a sense in\nwhich Dasein has an internal structural relation to the nothing. That\ninternal structural relation remains crucial to the later philosophy,\nbut now \u2018the nothing\u2019 is to be heard explicitly as\n\u2018the mystery\u2019, a kind of \u2018dark matter\u2019 of\nintelligibility that must remain concealed in the unfolding of Being\nthrough which beings are unconcealed. This necessary concealment is\n\u201cthe essential belongingness of the not to being as such\u201d\n(Contributions 160: 199). In Being-towards-death, this\n\u201cessential belongingness\u201d is \u201csheltered\u201d and\n\u201ccomes to light with a singular keenness\u201d\n(Contributions 160: 199). This is because (echoing a point\nmade earlier) the concealing-unconcealing structure of Being is\nultimately to be traced to Dasein's essential finitude. Sheehan\n(2001) puts it like this: \u201c[o]ur finitude makes all\n\u2018as\u2019-taking\u2026 possible by requiring us to understand\nthings not immediately and ontically\u2026 but indirectly and\nontologically (= imperfectly), through their being\u201d. In\nBeing-towards-death, the human finitude that grounds the mystery, the\nplenitude of possible worlds in which I am not, is highlighted. As\nmortals, then, our internal relation to death links us to the mystery\n(see The Thing). So dwelling (as poetic habitation) involves\nnot only embeddedness in the fourfold, but also, as part of a unitary\nontological structure, a necessary relationship with the mystery. (As\nmentioned earlier (2.2.7), it is arguable that the sense of the nothing\nas unactualized possibilities of Being is already at work in Being\nand Time (see Vallega-Neu 2003, 21). Indeed, Heidegger's\nexplicit remarks on Being-towards-death in the Contributions\n(sections 160\u20132) suggest that it is. But even if that is so, the idea\nundoubtedly finds its fullest expression in the later\nwork.)\n\n\nIf the essence of human Being is to dwell in the fourfold, then\nhuman beings are to the extent that they so dwell. And this\nwill be achieved to the extent that human beings realize the\n\u201cbasic character of dwelling\u201d, which Heidegger now argues\nis a matter of safeguarding \u201cthe fourfold in its\nessential unfolding\u201d (Building Dwelling Thinking, 352).\nSuch safeguarding is unpacked as a way of Being in which human beings\nsave the earth, receive the sky as sky, await the divinities as\ndivinities, and initiate their own essential being as mortals. Perhaps\nthe best way to understand this four-way demand is to explore\nHeidegger's claim that modern humans, especially modern Western\nhumans, systematically fail to meet it. That is, we are marked out by\nour loss of dwelling\u2014our failure to safeguard the fourfold in\nits essential unfolding. This existential malaise is what Heidegger\nrefers to in the Letter on Humanism as the oblivion of Being.\nAs we are about to see, the fact that this is the basic character of\nour modern human society is, according to Heidegger, explained by the\npredominance of a mode of sense-making that, in the\nContributions, he calls machination, but which he\nlater (and more famously) calls technology. \n3.3 Technology\n\n\nIn his 1953 piece The Question Concerning Technology,\nHeidegger begins with the everyday account of technology according to\nwhich technology is the vast array of instruments, machines, artefacts\nand devices that we human beings invent, build, and then exploit. On\nthis view technology is basically a tool that we control. Heidegger\nclaims that this everyday account is, in a sense, correct, but it\nprovides only a limited \u201cinstrumental and anthropological\ndefinition\u201d of technology (Question Concerning\nTechnology 312). It depicts technology as a means to an end\n(instrumental) and as a product of human activity (anthropological).\nWhat needs to be exposed and interrogated, however, is something that\nis passed over by the everyday account, namely the essence of\ntechnology. To bring this into view, Heidegger reinterprets his earlier\nnotion of intelligibility in terms of the concept of a\nclearing. A clearing is a region of Being in which things are\nrevealed as mattering in some specific way or another. To identify the\nessence of technology is to lay bare technology as a clearing, that is,\nto describe a technological mode of Being. As Heidegger puts it in the\nContributions (61: 88), \u201c[i]n the context of the\nbeing-question, this word [machination, technology] does not name a\nhuman comportment but a manner of the essential swaying of\nbeing\u201d.\n\n\nSo what is the character of entities as revealed technologically?\nHeidegger's claim is that the \u201crevealing that holds sway\nthroughout modern technology\u2026 [is]\u2026 a challenging\u2026\nwhich puts to nature the unreasonable demand that it supply energy\nwhich can be extracted and stored as such\u201d (Question\nConcerning Technology 320). The mode of revealing characteristic\nof modern technology understands phenomena in general\u2014including\nthe non-biological natural world, plants, animals, and indeed human\nbeings\u2014to be no more than what Heidegger calls\nstanding-reserve, that is, resources to be exploited as means\nto ends. This analysis extends to regions of nature and sections of\nsociety that have not yet been harnessed positively as resources. Such\nunexploited elements (e.g., an unexplored jungle, this year's\nunemployed school leavers) exist technologically precisely as\npotential resources.\n\n\nHeidegger's flagship example of technology is a hydroelectric\nplant built on the Rhine river that converts that river into a mere\nsupplier of water power. Set against this \u201cmonstrousness\u201d\n(Question Concerning Technology 321) is the poetic habitation\nof the natural environment of the Rhine as signalled by an old wooden\nbridge that spanned the river for hundreds of years, plus the river as\nrevealed by H\u00f6lderlin's poem \u201cThe Rhine\u201d. In\nthese cases of poetic habitation, natural phenomena are revealed to us\nas objects of respect and wonder. One might think that Heidegger is\nover-reacting here, and that despite the presence of the hydroelectric\nplant, the Rhine in many ways remains a glorious example of natural\nbeauty. Heidegger's response to this complaint is to focus on how\nthe technological mode of Being corrupts the very notion of unspoilt\nareas of nature, by reducing such areas to resources ripe for\nexploitation by the tourist industry. Turning our attention to\ninter-human affairs, the technological mode of Being manifests itself\nwhen, for example, a friendly chat in the bar is turned into networking\n(Dreyfus 1993). And, in the light of Heidegger's analysis, one\nmight smile wryly at the trend for companies to take what used to be\ncalled \u2018personnel\u2019 departments, and to rename them\n\u2018human resources\u2019. Many other examples could be given, but\nthe general point is clear. The primary phenomenon to be understood is\nnot technology as a collection of instruments, but rather technology as\na clearing that establishes a deeply instrumental and, as Heidegger\nsees it, grotesque understanding of the world in general. Of course, if\ntechnological revealing were a largely restricted phenomenon,\ncharacteristic of isolated individuals or groups, then\nHeidegger's analysis of it would be of limited interest. The\nsting in the tale, however, is that, according to Heidegger,\ntechnological revealing is not a peripheral aspect of Being. Rather, it\ndefines our modern way of living, at least in the\nWest.\n\n\nAt this point one might pause to wonder whether technology really is\nthe structure on which we should be concentrating. The\ncounter-suggestion would be that technological thinking is merely the\npractical application of modern mathematical science, and that the\nlatter is therefore the primary phenomenon. Heidegger rejects this\nview, arguing in contrast that the establishment of the technological\nmode of revealing is a necessary condition for there to be mathematical\nscience at all, since such science \u201cdemands that nature be\norderable as standing-reserve\u201d by requiring that \u201cnature\nreport itself in some way or other that is identifiable through\ncalculation and that it remain orderable as a system of\ninformation\u201d (Question Concerning Technology 328).\nEither way, one might object to the view of science at work here, by\npointing to analyses which suggest that while science may\nreduce objects to instrumental means rather than ends, it need not\nbehave in this way. For example, O'Neill (2003) develops such an\nanalysis by drawing explicitly on (one interpretation of) the Marxist\n(and ultimately Aristotelian) notion of the humanization of the\nsenses. Good science may depend on the capacity for the\ndisinterested use of the senses, and so foster a non-instrumental\nresponsiveness to natural objects as ends rather than as means. This is\na \u2018humanization\u2019 because the disinterested use of the\nsenses is a characteristically human capacity. Thus to develop such a\ncapacity is to develop a distinctively human virtue, something which is\na constituent of human well-being. Moreover, if science may sometimes\noperate with a sense of awe and wonder in the face of beings, it may\npoint the way beyond the technological clearing, an effect that, as we\nshall see later, Heidegger thinks is achieved principally by some great\nart. \n\n\nBy revealing beings as no more than the measurable and the\nmanipulable, technology ultimately reduces beings to\nnot-beings (Contributions 2: 6). This is our first\nproper glimpse of the oblivion of Being, the phenomenon that, in the\nContributions, Heidegger also calls the abandonment of Being,\nor the abandonment of beings by Being (e.g., 55: 80). The notion of a\nnot-being signals two things: (i) technological revealing drives out\nany sense of awe and wonder in the presence of beings, obliterating the\nsecularized sense of what is sacred that is exemplified by the poetic\nhabitation of the natural environment of the Rhine; (ii) we are\nessentially indifferent to the loss. Heidegger calls this indifference\n\u201cthe hidden distress of no-distress-at-all\u201d\n(Contributions 4: 8). Indeed, on Heidegger's diagnosis,\nour response to the loss of any feeling of sacredness or awe in the\nface of beings is to find a technological substitute for that feeling,\nin the form of \u201clived-experience\u201d, a drive for\nentertainment and information, \u201cexaggeration and uproar\u201d\n(Contributions 66: 91). All that said, however, technology\nshould not be thought of as a wholly \u2018negative\u2019 phenomenon.\nFor Heidegger, technology is not only the great danger, it is also a\nstage in the unfolding of Being that brings us to the brink of a kind\nof secularized salvation, by awakening in us a (re-)discovery of the\nsacred, appropriately understood (cf. Thomson 2003, 64\u201366). A rough\nanalogy might be drawn here with the Marxist idea that the unfolding of\nhistory results in the establishment of capitalist means of production\nwith their characteristic \u2018negative\u2019 elements\u2014labour treated merely as a commodity, the multi-dimensional alienation\nof the workers\u2014that bring us to the brink of (by creating the\nimmediate social and economic preconditions for) the socialist\ntransformation of society. Indeed, the analogy might be pushed a little\nfurther: just as the socialist transformation of society remains\nanything but inevitable (Trotsky taught us that), Heidegger argues that\nthe salvation-bringing transformation of the present condition of human\nbeing is most certainly not bound to\noccur.\n\n\nTo bring all these points into better view, we need to take a step\nback and ask the following question. Is the technological mode of\nrevealing ultimately a human doing for which we are responsible?\nHeidegger's answer is \u2018yes and no\u2019. On the one hand,\nhumankind is the active agent of technological thinking, so humankind\nis not merely a passive element. On the other hand, \u201cthe\nunconcealment itself\u2026 is never a human handiwork\u201d\n(Question Concerning Technology 324). As Heidegger later put\nit, the \u201cessence of man is framed, claimed and challenged by a\npower which manifests itself in the essence of technology, a power\nwhich man himself does not control.\u201d (Only a God\ncan Save Us; 107, my emphasis). To explicate the latter\npoint, Heidegger introduces the concepts of destining (cf. the\nearlier notion of \u2018destiny\u2019) and enframing.\nDestining is \u201cwhat first starts man upon a way of\nrevealing\u201d (Question Concerning Technology 329). As such\nit is an a priori transcendental structure of human Being and so beyond\nour control. Human history is a temporally organized kaleidoscope of\nparticular ordainings of destining (see also On the Essence of\nTruth). Enframing is one such ordaining, the \u201cgathering\ntogether of the setting-upon that sets upon man, i.e., challenges him\nforth, to reveal the actual, in the mode of ordering, as\nstanding-reserve\u201d (Question Concerning Technology 325).\nThis is, of course, a way of unpacking the point (see above) that\ntechnology is \u201ca manner of the essential swaying of being\u201d\n(Contributions 61: 88), that is, of Being's own\nessential unfolding. \n\n\nEnframing, then, is the ordaining of destining that ushers in the\nmodern technological clearing. But there is more to it than that. To\nsee why, consider the following criticism of Heidegger's\nanalysis, as we have unpacked it so far. Any suggestion that\ntechnological thinking has appeared for the first time along with our\nmodern Western way of living would seem to be straightforwardly false.\nTo put the point crudely, surely the ancient Greeks sometimes treated\nentities merely as instrumental means. But if that is right, and\nHeidegger would agree that it is, then how can it be that technological\nthinking defines the spirit of our age? The answer lies in\nHeidegger's belief that pre-modern, traditional artisanship (as\nexemplified by the old wooden bridge over the Rhine), manifests what he\ncalls poiesis. In this context poiesis is to be understood as\na process of gathering together and fashioning natural materials in\nsuch a way that the human project in which they figure is in a deep\nharmony with, indeed reveals\u2014or as Heidegger sometimes\nsays when discussing poiesis, brings forth\u2014the essence\nof those materials and any natural environment in which they are set.\nThus, in discussing what needs to be learnt by an apprentice to a\ntraditional cabinetmaker, Heidegger writes:\n\n\nIf he is to become a true cabinetmaker, he makes himself answer and\nrespond above all to the different kinds of wood and to the shapes\nslumbering within wood\u2014to wood as it enters into man's\ndwelling with all the hidden riches of its essence. In fact, this\nrelatedness to wood is what maintains the whole craft. Without that\nrelatedness, the craft will never be anything but empty busywork, any\noccupation with it will be determined exclusively by business concerns.\nEvery handicraft, all human dealings, are constantly in that danger.\n(What is Called Thinking? 379)\n\n\nPoiesis, then, is a process of revealing. Poietic events are acts of\nunconcealment\u2014one is tempted to coin the ugly neologism\ntruth-ing\u2014in which entities are allowed to show\nthemselves. As with the closely related notion of original truth that\nis at work in Being and Time, the idea of entities showing\nthemselves does not imply that what is revealed in poiesis is something\nindependent of human involvement. Thus what is revealed by the\nartisanship of the cabinetmaker is \u201cwood as it enters into\nman's dwelling\u201d. This telling remark forges a crucial\nphilosophical link (and not merely an etymological one) between the\npoietic and poetic. Poietic events and poetic habitation involve the\nvery same mode of intelligibility.\n\n\nBy introducing the concept of poiesis, and by unearthing the\npresence of the phenomenon in traditional artisanship, Heidegger is\nsuggesting that even though technological thinking was a possibility in\npre-modern society, it was neither the only nor the dominant mode of\nbringing-forth. So what has changed? Heidegger argues that what is\ndistinctive about enframing as an ordaining of destining is (i) that it\n\u201cdrives out every other possibility of revealing\u201d\n(Question Concerning Technology 332), and (ii) that it covers\nup revealing as such (more precisely, covers up the\nconcealing-unconcealing character of appropriation), thereby leaving us\nblind to the fact that technology is, in its essence, a clearing. For\nHeidegger, these dual features of enframing are intimately tied up with\nthe idea of technology as metaphysics completing itself. He\nwrites: \u201c[a]s a form of truth [clearing] technology is grounded\nin the history of metaphysics, which is itself a distinctive and up to\nnow the only perceptible phase of the history of Being\u201d\n(Letter on Humanism 244). According to Heidegger, metaphysics\nconceives of Being as a being (for more on the reduction of Being to a\nbeing, see section 2.2.1 above). In so doing, metaphysics obscures the\nconcealing-unconcealing dynamic of the essential unfolding of Being, a\ndynamic that provides the a priori condition for there to be beings.\nThe history of metaphysics is thus equivalent to the history of Western\nphilosophy in which Being as such is passed over, a history that, for\nHeidegger, culminates in the nihilistic forces of Nietzsche's\neternally recurring will-to-power. The totalizing logic of metaphysics\ninvolves the view that there is a single clearing (whatever it may be)\nthat constitutes reality. This renders thought insensitive to the\nfundamental structure of Being, in which any particular clearing is\nontologically co-present with the unintelligible plenitude of\nalternative clearings, the mystery. With this totalizing logic in view,\nenframing might be thought of as the ordaining of destining that\nestablishes the technological clearing as the one dominant picture, to\nthe exclusion of all others. Hence technology is metaphysics completing\nitself.\n\n\nWe are now in a position to deal with two items of unfinished\nbusiness. First, recall the stylistic shift that characterizes\nHeidegger's later work. Heidegger not only increasingly engages\nwith poetry in his later thinking (especially the works of the German\nlyric poet H\u00f6lderlin), he also adopts a substantially more poetic\nstyle of writing. But why? The language of metaphysics, which\nultimately unpacks itself as technological, calculative thinking, is a\nlanguage from which Heidegger believed he did not fully escape in\nBeing and Time (see quotation from the Letter on\nHumanism at the beginning of section 3.1 above, and Vallega-Neu\n2003 24\u20139 for discussion). What is needed to think Being historically,\nto think Being in its essential unfolding, is a different kind of\nphilosophical language, a language suggested by the poetic character of\ndwelling. It is important to realize that Heidegger's intention\nhere is not to place Being beyond philosophy and within the reach of\npoetry, although he does believe that certain poets, such as\nH\u00f6lderlin, enable us to glimpse the mysterious aspect of Being.\nHis intention, rather, is to establish that the kind of philosophy that\nis needed here is itself poetic. This explains the stylistic component\nof the turn.\n\n\nSecondly, recall the loss of dwelling identified by Heidegger.\nModern humankind (at least in the West) is in the (enframed) grip of\ntechnological thinking. Because of this promotion of instrumentality as\nthe fundamental way of Being of entities, we have lost sight of how to\ninhabit the fourfold poetically, of how to safeguard the fourfold in\nits essential unfolding. Such safeguarding would, in a sense, be the\nopposite of technological thinking. But what \u2018opposite\u2019\namounts to here needs to be worked out with care. Given contemporary\nconcerns over deforestation, global warming and the like, it is\ntempting to think that Heidegger's analysis of technology might\nprovide the philosophical platform for some sort of extreme\neco-radicalism. However, while there is undoubtedly much of value to be\nsaid about the contribution that Heidegger's thinking may make to\ncontemporary debates in environmental ethics (see e.g., Zimmerman 1983,\n1993, 2002), Heidegger was no eco-warrior and no luddite. Although he\noften promoted a romantic image of a pre-technological age inhabited by\nworthy peasants in touch with nature, he did not believe that it is\npossible for modern humankind to forge some pastoral Eden from which\ntechnology (in both the everyday and the essential sense) is entirely\nabsent. So we should neither \u201cpush on blindly with\ntechnology\u201d nor \u201ccurse it as the work of the devil\u201d\n(Question Concerning Technology 330). Indeed, both these\noptions would at root be technological modes of thinking. The way\nforward, according to Heidegger, is not to end technology, but rather\nto inhabit it differently (see e.g., Vallega-Neu 2003 93 note 15). We\nneed to transform our mode of Being into one in which technology (in\nthe sense of the machines and devices of the modern age) is there for\nus to enjoy and use, but in which technology (in the sense of a mode of\nBeing-in-the-world) is not our only or fundamental way of encountering\nentities. And what is the basic character of this reinhabiting? It is\nto shelter the truth of Being in beings (e.g.,\nContributions 246: 273), to safeguard the fourfold in its\nessential unfolding. In what, then, does this safeguarding\nconsist?\n3.4 Safeguarding\n\n\nHeidegger argues that if humankind is to enter into safeguarding, it\nneeds to learn (or perhaps to learn once more) to think of Being as a\ngift that has been granted to us in history. Indeed, to think properly\nis precisely to be grateful for the gift of Being (see What is\nCalled Thinking?). (Terms such as \u2018gift\u2019 and\n\u2018granted\u2019 should not be heard theologically, but in terms\nof secularized sacredness and destining.) In this learning process,\ncertain artworks constitute ontological beacons that disrupt the\ntechnological clearing. Thus recall that Heidegger identifies a shared\nform of disclosure that is instantiated both by the old wooden bridge\nover the Rhine and by H\u00f6lderlin's poem \u201cThe\nRhine\u201d. We can now understand this identification in terms of the\nclaim that certain artworks (although of course not those that\nthemselves fall prey to technological thinking) share with traditional\nartisanship the capacity to realize poiesis. In so doing such artworks\nsucceed in bringing us into contact with the mystery through their\nexpression of dwelling (poetic habitation). In listening attentively\nand gratefully to how Being announces itself in such artworks,\nhumankind will prepare themselves for the task of\nsafeguarding.\n\n\nBut what exactly would one do in order to safeguard the\nfourfold in its essential unfolding. Recall that in Building\nDwelling Thinking Heidegger presents safeguarding as a\nfour-dimensional way of Being. The first two dimensions\u2014saving\nthe earth and receiving the sky as sky\u2014refer to our\nrelationship with the non-human natural world. As such they forge a\ngenuine connection between the later Heidegger and contemporary\nenvironmentalist thinking. However, the connection needs to be stated\nwith care. Once again the concept of poiesis is central. Heidegger\nholds that the self-organized unfolding of the natural world, the\nunaided blossoming of nature, is itself a process of poiesis.\nIndeed it is poiesis \u201cin the highest sense\u201d (Question\nConcerning Technology 317). One might think, then, that saving the\nearth, safeguarding in its first dimension, is a matter of leaving\nnature to its own devices, of actively ensuring that the conditions\nobtain for unaided natural poiesis. However, for Heidegger, saving the\nearth is primarily an ontological, rather than an ecological, project.\n\u2018Save\u2019 here means \u201cto set something free into its own\nessence\u201d (Building Dwelling Thinking, p.352), and thus\njoins a cluster of related concepts that includes dwelling and also\npoiesis as realized in artisanship and art. So while, say,\nfiercely guarding the integrity of wilderness areas may be one route to\nsafeguarding, saving the earth may also be achieved through the kind of\nartisanship and its associated gathering of natural materials that is\ncharacteristic of the traditional cabinetmaker. The concept of saving\nas a setting free of something into its own essence also clears a path\nto another important point. All four dimensions of safeguarding have at\ntheir root the notion of staying with things, of letting\nthings be in their essence through cultivation or construction.\nHeidegger describes such staying with things as \u201cthe only way in\nwhich the fourfold stay within the fourfold [i.e., safeguarding] is\naccomplished at any time in simple unity\u201d (Building Dwelling\nThinking 353). It is thus the unifying existential structure of\nsafeguarding.\n\n\nWhat now of safeguarding in its second dimension\u2014to receive\nthe sky as sky? Here Heidegger's main concern seems to be to\nadvocate the synchronization of contemporary human life with the\nrhythms of nature (day and night, the seasons, and so on). Here\nsafeguarding is exemplified by the aforementioned peasants whose lives\nwere interlocked with such natural rhythms (through planting seasons\netc.) in a way that modern technological society is not. One might note\nthat this dislocation has become even more pronounced since\nHeidegger's death, with the advent of the Internet-driven,\n24-hours-a-day-7-days-a-week service culture. Once again we need to\nemphasize that Heidegger's position is not some sort of\nphilosophical ludditism, but a plea for the use of contemporary\nmachines and devices in a way that is sensitive to the temporal\npatterns of the natural world. (For useful discussion see Young 2002,\n110\u2013113. Young makes an illuminating connection with Heidegger's\neulogy to van Gogh's painting of a pair of peasant shoes to be\nfound in The Origin of the Work of Art.)\n\n\n\nOf course, these relationships with nature are still only part of\nwhat safeguarding involves. Its third and fourth dimensions demand that\nhuman beings await the divinities as divinities and \u201cinitiate\ntheir own essential being\u2014their being capable of death as death\u2014into the use and practice of this capacity, so that there may\nbe a good death\u201d (Building Dwelling Thinking 352). The\nlatter demand suggests that we may safeguard each other as mortals by\nintegrating a non-evasive attitude to death (see above) into the\ncultural structures (e.g., the death-related customs and ceremonies) of\nthe community. But now what about the third dimension of safeguarding?\nWhat does it mean to await the divinities as\ndivinities?\n\n\nLet's again approach our question via a potential problem with\nHeidegger's account. Echoing a worry that attaches to the concept\nof heritage in Being and Time, it may seem that the notion of\ndestining, especially in its more specific manifestation as enframing,\ninvolves a kind of fatalism. Despite some apparent rhetoric to the\ncontrary, however, Heidegger's considered view is that destining\nis ultimately not a \u201cfate that compels\u201d\n(Question Concerning Technology 330). We have been granted the\nsaving power to transform our predicament. Moreover, the fact that\nwe are at a point of danger\u2014a point at which the grip of\ntechnological thinking has all but squeezed out access to the poetic\nand the mystical\u2014will have the effect of thrusting this saving\npower to the fore. This is the good news. The bad news is that:\n\n\nphilosophy will not be able to effect an immediate transformation of\nthe present condition of the world. This is not only true of\nphilosophy, but of all merely human thought and endeavor. Only a god\ncan save us. The sole possibility that is left for us is to prepare a\nsort of readiness, through thinking and poetizing, for the appearance\nof the god or for the absence of the god in the time of foundering\n[Untergang]; for in the face of the god who is absent, we\nfounder. (Only a God can Save Us\n107)\n\n\nThat is what it means to await the divinities as divinities.\n3.5 Only a God can Save Us\n\n\nHeidegger sometimes uses the term \u2018god\u2019 to mean the\nsecularized notion of the sacred already indicated, such that to\nembrace a god would be to maintain due sensitivity to the thought that\nbeings are granted to us in the essential unfolding of Being.\nWhen, in the Contributions, Heidegger writes of the last or\nultimate god of the other beginning (where \u2018other\u2019 is in\nrelation to the \u2018first beginning\u2019 of Western thought in\nancient Greece\u2014the beginning of metaphysics), it often seems to\nbe this secularized sacredness that he has in mind (cf. Thomson 2003;\nsee Crownfield 2001for an alternative reading of the last god that\nmaintains a more robust theological dimension, although one which is\nconcrete and historicized). However, Heidegger sometimes seems to use\nthe term \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018divinity\u2019 to refer to a\nheroic figure (a cultural template) who may initiate (or help to\ninitiate) a transformational event in the history of Being by opening\nup an alternative clearing (for this interpretation, see e.g., Young\n2002, 98). These heroic figures are the grounders of the abyss, the\nrestorers of sacredness (Contributions 2: 6, see Sallis 2001\nfor analysis and discussion). It might even be consistent with\nHeidegger's view to relax the requirement that the divine\ncatalyst must be an individual being, and thus to conceive of certain\ntransformational cultural events or forces themselves as divinities\n(Dreyfus 2003). In any case, Heidegger argues that, in the present\ncrisis, we are waiting for a god who will reawaken us to the poetic,\nand thereby enable us to dwell in the fourfold. This task certainly\nseems to be a noble one. Unfortunately, however, it plunges us into the\nmurkiest and most controversial region of the Heideggerian intellectual\nlandscape, his infamous involvement with Nazism.\n\n\nHere is not the place to enter into the historical debate over\nexactly what Heidegger did and when he did it. However, given his\ndeliberate, albeit arguably short-lived, integration of Nazi ideology\nwith the philosophy of Being (see above), a few all-too-brief comments\non the relationship between Heidegger's politics and his\nphilosophical thought are necessary. (For more detailed evidence and\ndiscussion, as well as a range of positions on how we should interpret\nand respond to this relationship, see e.g., Farias 1989; Neske and\nKettering 1990; Ott 1993; Pattison 2000; Polt 1999; Rockmore 1992;\nSluga, 1993; Wolin 1990, 1993; Young 1997). There is no doubt that\nHeidegger's Nazi sympathies, however long they lasted, have a\nmore intimate relationship with his philosophical thought than might be\nsuggested by apologist claims that he was a victim of his time (in\n1933, lots of intelligent people backed Hitler without thereby\nsupporting the Holocaust that was to come) or that what we have here is\n\u2018merely\u2019 a case of bad political judgment, deserving of\ncensure but with no implications for the essentially independent\nphilosophical programme. Why does the explanation run deeper? The\nanswer is that Heidegger believed (indeed continued to believe until he\ndied) that the German people were destined to carry out a monumental\nspiritual mission. That mission was nothing less than to be at the helm\nof the aforementioned transformation of Being in the West, from one of\ninstrumental technology to one of poetic dwelling. In mounting this\ntransformation the German people would be acting not imperialistically,\nbut for all nations in the encounter with modern technology. Of course\ndestining is not a fate that compels, so some divine catalyst would be\nneeded to awake the German nation to its historic mission, a catalyst\nprovided by the spiritual leaders of the Nazi Party.\n\n\nWhy did Heidegger believe that the German people enjoyed this\nposition of world-historical significance? In the later writings\nHeidegger argues explicitly that \u201c[t]hinking itself can be\ntransformed only by a thinking which has the same origin and\ncalling\u201d, so the technological mode of Being must be transcended\nthrough a new appropriation of the European tradition. Within this\nprocess the German people have a special place, because of the\n\u201cinner relationship of the German language with the language of\nthe Greeks and with their thought\u201d. (Quotations from\nOnly a God can Save Us 113.) Thus it is\nthe German language that links the German people in a privileged way\nto, as Heidegger sees it, the genesis of European thought and to a\npre-technological world-view in which bringing-forth as poiesis is\ndominant. This illustrates the general point that, for Heidegger, Being\nis intimately related to language. Language is, as he famously put it\nin the Letter on Humanism (217), the \u201chouse of\nBeing\u201d. So it is via language that Being is linked to particular\npeoples.\n\n\nEven if Heidegger had some sort of argument for the world-historical\ndestiny of the German people, why on earth did he believe that the Nazi\nParty, of all things, harboured the divine catalyst? Part of the reason\nseems to have been the seductive effect of a resonance that exists\nbetween (a) Heidegger's understanding of traditional German rural\nlife as realizing values and meanings that may counteract the insidious\neffects of contemporary technology, and (b) the Nazi image of rustic\nGerman communities, rooted in German soil, providing a bulwark against\nforeign contamination. Heidegger certainly exploits this resonance in\nhis pro-Nazi writings. That said there is an important point of\ndisagreement here, one that Heidegger himself drew out. And once again\nthe role of language in Being is at the heart of the issue. Heidegger\nsteadfastly refused to countenance any biologistic underpinning to his\nviews. In 1945 he wrote that, in his 1934 lectures on logic, he\n\u201csought to show that language was not the biological-racial\nessence of man, but conversely, that the essence of man was based on\nlanguage as a basic reality of spirit\u201d (Letter to\nthe Rector of Freiburg University, November 4, 1945, 64). In words\nthat we have just met, it is language and not biology that, for\nHeidegger, constitutes the house of Being. So the German Volk\nare a linguistic-historical, rather than a biological, phenomenon,\nwhich explains why Heidegger officially rejected one of the keystones\nof Nazism, namely its biologically grounded racism. Perhaps Heidegger\ndeserves some credit here, although regrettably the aforementioned\nlectures on logic also contain evidence of a kind of historically\ndriven \u2018racism\u2019. Heidegger suggests that while Africans\n(along with plants and animals) have no history (in a technical sense\nunderstood in terms of heritage), the event of an airplane carrying\nHitler to Mussolini is genuinely part of history (see Polt 1999,\n155).\n\n\nHeidegger was soon disappointed by his \u2018divinities\u2019. In\na 1935 lecture he remarks that theworks that are being peddled\n(about) nowadays as the philosophy of National Socialism, but have\nnothing whatever to do with the inner truth and greatness of this\nmovement (namely, the encounter between global technology and\ncontemporary man), have all been written by men fishing the troubled\nwaters of values and totalities. (An Introduction to\nMetaphysics 166) So Heidegger came to believe that the spiritual\nleaders of the Nazi party were false gods. They were ultimately agents\nof technological thought and thus incapable of completing the historic\nmission of the German people to transcend global technology.\nNonetheless, one way of hearing the 1935 remark is that Heidegger\ncontinued to believe in the existence of, and the philosophical\nmotivation for, that mission, a view that Rockmore (1992, 123\u20134) calls\n\u201can ideal form of Nazism\u201d. This interpretation has some\nforce. But perhaps we can at least make room for the thought that\nHeidegger's repudiation of Nazism goes further than talk of an\nideal Nazism allows. For example, responding to the fact that Heidegger\ndrew a parallel between modern agriculture (as a motorized\nfood-industry) and \u201cthe manufacturing of corpses in gas chambers\nand extermination camps\u201d, Young (1997) argues that this would\ncount as a devaluing of the Holocaust only on a superficial reading.\nAccording to Young, Heidegger's point is that both modern\nagriculture and the Final Solution are workings-out of the\ntechnological mode of Being, which does not entail that they should be\ntreated as morally equivalent. (Heidegger draws the parallel in a\nlecture called The Enframing given in 1949. The quotation is\ntaken from Young 1997, 172. For further discussion, see Pattison\n2000).\n\n\nHeidegger's involvement with Nazism casts a shadow over his\nlife. Whether, and if so to what extent, it casts a more concentrated\nshadow over at least some of his philosophical work is a more difficult\nissue. It would be irresponsible to ignore the relationship between\nHeidegger's philosophy and his politics. But it is surely\npossible to be critically engaged in a deep and intellectually\nstimulating way with his sustained investigation into Being, to find\nmuch of value in his capacity to think deeply about human life, to\nstruggle fruitfully with what he says about our loss of dwelling, and\nto appreciate his massive and still unfolding contribution to thought\nand to thinking, without looking for evidence of Nazism in every twist\nand turn of the philosophical path he lays down.
