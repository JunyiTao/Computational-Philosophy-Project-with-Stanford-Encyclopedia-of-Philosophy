    "main_text": "Criticisms of Coherence Theories of Truth\n4. New Objections to Coherentism\n\n Paul Thagard is the author of the first of two recent new arguments\n against the coherence theory. Thagard states his argument as\n follows:\nif there is a world independent of representations of it,\nas historical evidence suggests, then the aim of representation should\nbe to describe the world, not just to relate to other\nrepresentations. My argument does not refute the coherence theory, but\nshows that it implausibly gives minds too large a place in\nconstituting truth. (Thagard 2007: 29\u201330)\n\n\nThagard\u2019s argument seems to be that if there is a mind-independent\nworld, then our representations are representations of the world. (He\nsays representations \u201cshould be\u201d of the world, but the\nargument is invalid with the addition of the auxiliary verb.) The\nworld existed before humans and our representations, including our\npropositional representations. (So history and, Thagard would likely\nsay, our best science tells us.)  Therefore, representations,\nincluding propositional representations, are representations of a\nmind-independent world. The second sentence of the passage just quoted\nsuggests that the only way that coherentists can reject this argument\nis to adopt some sort of idealism. That is, they can only reject the\nminor premiss of the argument as reconstructed. Otherwise they are\ncommitted to saying that propositions represent the world and, Thagard\nseems to suggest, this is to say that propositions have the sort of\ntruth-conditions posited by a correspondence theory. So the coherence\ntheory is false.\n\n\nIn reply to this argument, coherentists can deny that\npropositions are representations of a mind-independent world. To say\nthat a proposition is true is to say that it is supported by a\nspecified system of propositions. So, the coherentist can say,\npropositions are representations of systems of beliefs, not\nrepresentations of a mind-independent world. To assert a proposition\nis to assert that it is entailed by a system of beliefs. The\ncoherentist holds that even if there is a mind-independent world, it\ndoes not follow that the \u201cthe point\u201d of representations is\nto represent this world. If coherentists have been led to their\nposition by an epistemological route, they believe that we cannot\n\u201cget outside\u201d our system of beliefs. If we cannot get\noutside of our system of beliefs, then it is hard to see how we can be\nsaid to represent a mind-independent reality.\n\n\nColin McGinn has proposed the other new objection to coherentism. He\nargues (McGinn 2002: 195) that coherence theorists are committed to\nidealism. Like Thagard, he takes idealism to be obviously false, so\nthe argument is a reductio. McGinn\u2019s argument runs as\nfollows. Coherentists are committed to the view that, for example,\n\u2018Snow falls from the sky\u2019 is true iff the belief that snow\nfalls from the sky coheres with other beliefs. Now it follows from\nthis and the redundancy biconditional (p is true\niff p) that snow falls from the sky iff the belief that snow\nfalls from the sky coheres with other beliefs. It appears then that\nthe coherence theorist is committed to the view that snow could not\nfall from the sky unless the belief that snow falls from the sky\ncoheres with other beliefs. From this it follows that how things are\ndepends on what is believed about them. This seems strange to McGinn\nsince he thinks, reasonably, that snow could fall from the sky even if\nthere were no beliefs about snow, or anything else. The linking of how\nthings are and how they are believed to be leads McGinn to say that\ncoherentists are committed to idealism, this being the view that how\nthings are is mind-dependent.\n\n\nCoherentists have a response to this objection. McGinn\u2019s argument\nworks because he takes it that the redundancy biconditional means\nsomething like \u201cp is true\nbecause p\u201d. Only if redundancy biconditionals are\nunderstood in this way does McGinn\u2019s argument go through. McGinn needs\nto be talking about what makes \u201cSnow falls from the sky\u201d\ntrue for his reductio to work. Otherwise, coherentists who reject his\nargument cannot be charged with idealism. He assumes, in a way that a\ncoherent theorist can regard as question-begging, that the truth-maker\nof the sentence in question is an objective way the world\nis. Coherentists deny that any sentences are made true by objective\nconditions. In particular, they hold that the falling of snow from the\nsky does not make \u201cSnow falls from the sky\u201d\ntrue. Coherentists hold that it, like any other sentence, is true\nbecause it coheres with a system of beliefs. So coherentists appear to\nhave a plausible defence against McGinn\u2019s objection.\n",
