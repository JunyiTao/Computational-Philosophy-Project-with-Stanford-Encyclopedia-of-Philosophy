    "main_text": "The sense of body ownership || The feeling of myness\n4.1 The feeling of myness\n\nThe notion of myness, which can be defined as the de se\nproperty of belonging to the subject, has recently attracted\nincreasing attention in the literature (Guillot 2017; Guillot &\nGarc\u00eda-Carpintero forthcoming). The hypothesis then is that one\nexperiences one\u2019s body as one\u2019s own in virtue of having a\nfeeling of myness. Nonconceptual myness content can then provide\nrational ground for conceptual myness content. The myness hypothesis,\nhowever, is not without raising a number of controversies and most\nrecent views have rejected it (Alsmith 2015; Berm\u00fadez 2011;\nChadha 2018; \nMartin 1995; Vignemont 2020; Wu forthcoming). A first worry concerns\nthe origin of myness. Unless one posits myness as an irreducible\nprimitive phenomenal property (Billon 2017), the nonconceptual myness\ncontent itself requires explanation. Another worry is that it does not\nseem salient in our phenomenology. Chadha (2018) argues that by\ndefault, the content of bodily experiences is not self-referential. On\nher view, disownership syndromes do not result from the lack of\nmyness, but from an unusual feeling of the hand not being one's\nown. One may also argue that the feeling of myness is not\ncompatible with a parsimonious conception of the admissible contents\nof perception, according to which only low-level somatosensory\nproperties such as pressure, joint angle, and temperature can be\nrepresented in the content of bodily experiences. Finally,\nBerm\u00fadez (2011, 2015, 2018) appeals to Anscombe\u2019s\nargument for knowledge without observation. He argues that one cannot\ngive a separately describable description of the feeling of myness,\nwhich thus cannot constitute a legitimate ground for ownership\njudgments.\n\nDenying the existence of myness feelings, however, does not entail\ndenying the phenomenology of ownership: \n\n\nownership is phenomenologically salient \u2026 when we experience\nour bodies we experience them as our own \u2026 there is a\nphenomenology of ownership. (Berm\u00fadez 2015: 38) \n\n\nIn other terms, it makes a phenomenological difference when one is not\naware of one\u2019s body as one\u2019s own and when one is not. The\nquestion then is how to best interpret this phenomenological\ndifference: in sensory terms (Wu forthcoming; Berm\u00fadez 2011;\nMartin 1995; Dokic 2003), in cognitive terms (Alsmith 2015), in\nagentive terms (Peacocke 2017), or in affective terms (Vignemont\n2018).\n",
