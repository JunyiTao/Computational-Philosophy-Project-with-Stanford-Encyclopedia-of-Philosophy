    "main_text": "Empirical Faithfulness and Empirical Adequacy\n6. Empirical Faithfulness and Empirical Adequacy\n\nEverett took pure wave mechanics to empirically faithful because (1)\none can find an observer\u2019s experience in the relative records of\nthe observer as modeled in the theory and (2) pure wave mechanics\nprovides something that one can take as a typicality measure over\nrelative states such that a typical relative sequence of measurement\nrecords in that measure will exhibit the standard quantum statistics.\nThe first is Everett\u2019s resolution of the determinate record\nproblem, and the second is his resolution of the probability problem.\nThat said, one might want more than empirical faithfulness from a\nsatisfactory formulation of quantum mechanics.\n\nThat empirical faithfulness is a weak standard of empirical adequacy\nis illustrated in what Everett\u2019s formulation of pure wave\nmechanics does not explain about our experience. It does not explain\nwhat it is about the physical world that makes it appropriate to\nexpect one\u2019s relative sequence of records to be typical\nin the norm-squared-coefficient sense, or in any other sense, at a\ntime. Nor does it explain why one should expect alternative\nfuture measurement results with the standard quantum\nprobabilities. The lack of both synchronic and forward-looking\nprobabilities means that Everett did not deduce the probabilistic\npredictions of rule 4b as subjective appearances to his modeled\nobservers. It also illustrates the need for relatively strong\nauxiliary assumptions in order to derive anything like the standard\nquantum predictions from pure wave mechanics.\n\nThe upshot is that while the relative state formulation of pure wave\nmechanics is logically consistent and empirically faithful in a sense\nthat Everett thought sufficient, it does not make the standard\nprobabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics for even simple\nexperiments and, hence, fails to be empirically adequate in any\nstandard sense. There is a long tradition of supplementing pure wave\nmechanics with yet stronger auxiliary assumptions in order to get a\ntheory that one might take to be straightforwardly empirically\nadequate. This is the aim of the various many-worlds reconstructions\nof Everett\u2019s relative state formulation.\n",
