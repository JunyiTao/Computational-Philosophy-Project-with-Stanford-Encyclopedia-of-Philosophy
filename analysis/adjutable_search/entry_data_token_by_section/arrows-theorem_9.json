    "main_text": "The Conditions, again || Unrestricted Domain\n4.1 Unrestricted Domain\nArrow\u2019s domain condition U says that the domain of the\nsocial welfare function includes every list of \\(n\\) weak orderings of\n\\(X\\). For example, suppose the alternatives are \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), and\nthat the people are 1, 2, and 3. There are 13 weak orderings of three\nalternatives, so the unrestricted domain contains 2197 (that is,\n\\(13^{3}\\)) lists of weak orderings of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\). A social\nwelfare function \\(f\\) for these alternatives and people, if it\nsatisfies U, maps each one of these \u201clogically\npossible\u201d preference profiles onto a collective preference among\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\).\nIn Arrow\u2019s account, the different profiles in a domain represent\npreferences that the people might turn out to have. To\nimpose U, on his epistemic rationale, amounts to assuming\nthat they might have any preferences at all: it is only when their\npreferences could be anything that it makes sense to require the\nsocial welfare function to be ready for everything. Arrow wrote in\nsupport of U:\n\n If we do not wish to require any prior knowledge\nof the tastes of individuals before specifying our social welfare\nfunction, that function will have to be defined for every logically\npossible set of individual orderings. (Arrow 1951 [1963]: 24)\n\nThere have been misunderstandings. Some think U requires\nof social welfare functions that they can handle \u201cany old\u201d\nalternatives. It does nothing of the sort. What it requires is that the\nsocial welfare function can handle the widest possible range\nof preferences among whichever alternatives there are to\nchoose among, and whether there happen to be many of these or only a\nfew of them is beside the point: the domain of a social welfare\nfunction can be completely unrestricted even if there are in \\(X\\) just\ntwo alternatives. One way to sustain this unorthodox understanding\nof U is, perhaps, to think of Arrow\u2019s \\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\) not as alternatives properly\nspeaking\u2014not as candidates in elections, social states, or what\nhave you\u2014but as names or labels that represent these on\ndifferent occasions for choosing. Then, it might be thought, variety\namong the alternatives to which the labels can be attached will generate\nvariety among the profiles that an aggregation procedure might be\nexpected to handle.  Blackorby et al. (2006) toy with this idea at one\npoint, but they quickly set it aside. It does not seem to have been\nexplored in the literature.\nOf course, there is nothing to keep anyone from reinterpreting\nArrow\u2019s basic notions, including the set \\(X\\) of alternatives, in any\nway they like; a theorem is a theorem no matter what interpretation\nit is given. It is important to realize, though, that to interpret\n\\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\) as labels is not standard, and can\nonly make nonsense of much of the theory of social choice to which\nArrow\u2019s theorem has given \nrise.[4]\nArrow already knew that U is a stronger domain condition\nthan is needed for an impossibility result. The free triple\nproperty and the chain property are weaker conditions\nthat replace U in some versions of Arrow\u2019s theorem (Campbell\nand Kelly 2002). These versions, being more informative, are, from a\nlogical point of view, better. U is simpler to state than\ntheir domain conditions, though, and might be found more\nintuitive. Notice that the weaker domain conditions still require a\nlot of variety among profiles. A typical proof of an Arrow-style\nimpossibility theorem requires that the domain is unrestricted with\nrespect to some three alternatives. In this case there is always a\npreference profile like the one implicated in the paradox of voting\nin Section 1, from which pairwise majority\ndecision derives a cycle.\nWhether it is sensible to impose U or any other domain\ncondition on a social welfare function depends very much on the\nparticulars of the choice problem being studied. Sometimes, in the\nnature of the alternatives under consideration, and the way in which\nindividual preferences among them are determined, imposing U\ncertainly is not appropriate. If for instance the alternatives are\ndifferent ways of dividing up a pie among some people, and it is known\nprior to selecting a social welfare function that these people are\nselfish, each caring only about the size of his own piece, then it\nmakes no obvious sense to require of a suitable function that it can\nhandle cases in which some people prefer to have less for themselves\nthan to have more. The social welfare function will never be called on\nto handle such cases for the simple reason that they will never arise.\nArrow made this point as follows:\n\n[I]t has frequently been assumed or implied in welfare economics\nthat each individual values different social states solely according\nto his consumption under them. If this be the case, we should only\nrequire that our social welfare function be defined for those sets of\nindividual orderings which are of the type described; only such should\nbe admissible (Arrow 1951 [1963]: 24).\n\nSection 5.1 considers some of the\npossibilities that open up when there is no need to reckon with all\n\u201clogically possible\u201d individual preferences.\n",
