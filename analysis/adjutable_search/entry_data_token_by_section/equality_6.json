We need to know the dimensions within\nwhich the striving for equality is morally relevant. What follows is a\nbrief review of the seven most prominent conceptions of distributive\nequality, each offering a different answer to one question: in the\nfield of distributive justice, what should be equalized, or what\nshould be the parameter or \u201ccurrency\u201d of equality?\n",
