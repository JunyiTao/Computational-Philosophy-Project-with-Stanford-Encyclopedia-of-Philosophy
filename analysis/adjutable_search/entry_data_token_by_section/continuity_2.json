    "main_text": "The Continuum and the Infinitesimal in the Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Periods\n3. The Continuum and the Infinitesimal in the Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Periods\n\nThe scholastic philosophers of Medieval Europe, in thrall to the\nmassive authority of Aristotle, mostly subscribed in one form or\nanother to the thesis, argued with great effectiveness by the Master\nin Book VI of the Physics, that continua cannot be composed\nof indivisibles. On the other hand, the avowed infinitude of the Deity\nof scholastic theology, which ran counter to Aristotle\u2019s thesis\nthat the infinite existed only in a potential sense, emboldened\ncertain of the Schoolmen to speculate that the actual infinite might\nbe found even outside the Godhead, for instance in the assemblage of\npoints on a continuous line. A few scholars of the time, for example\nHenry of Harclay (c. 1275\u20131317) and Nicholas of Autrecourt (c.\n1300\u201369) chose to follow Epicurus in upholding atomism\nreasonable and attempted to circumvent Aristotle\u2019s\ncounterarguments (Pyle 1997).\n\nThis incipient atomism met with a determined synechist rebuttal,\ninitiated by John Duns Scotus (c. 1266\u20131308). In his analysis of\nthe problem of \u201cwhether an angel can move from place to place\nwith a continuous motion\u201d (Opus Oxoniense, see Grant 1974, \u00a752)\nhe offers a pair of purely\ngeometrical arguments against the composition of a continuum out of\nindivisibles. One of these arguments is that if the diagonal and the\nside of a square were both composed of points, then not only would the\ntwo be commensurable in violation of Book X of Euclid, they would even\nbe equal. In the other, two unequal circles are constructed about a\ncommon center, and from the supposition that the larger circle is\ncomposed of points, part of an angle is shown to be equal to the\nwhole, in violation of Euclid\u2019s axiom V.\n\nWilliam of Ockham (c. 1280\u20131349) brought a considerable degree\nof dialectical\n subtlety[13]\n to his analysis of continuity; it has been the subject of much\nscholarly\n dispute.[14]\n For Ockham the principal difficulty presented by the continuous is\nthe infinite divisibility of space, and in general, that of any\ncontinuum. The treatment of continuity in the first book of his\nQuodlibet of 1322\u20137 rests on the idea that between any\ntwo points on a line there is a third\u2014perhaps the first explicit\nformulation of the property of density\u2014and on the\ndistinction between a continuum \u201cwhose parts form a\nunity\u201d (QQ, 510) from a contiguum of juxtaposed\nthings. Ockham recognizes that it follows from the property of density\nthat on arbitrarily small stretches of a line infinitely many points\nmust lie, but resists the conclusion that lines, or indeed any\ncontinuum, consists of points.  Concerned, rather, to determine\n\u201cthe sense in which the line may be said to consist or to be\nmade up of anything\u201d (QQ, 507), Ockham claims that \u201cno\npart of the line is indivisible, nor is any part of a continuum\nindivisible\u201d (QQ, 507). While Ockham does not assert that a line\nis actually \u201ccomposed\u201d of points, he had the insight,\nstartling in its prescience, that a punctate and yet continuous line\nbecomes a possibility when conceived as a dense array of points,\nrather than as an assemblage of points in contiguous succession.\n\nThe most ambitious and systematic attempt at refuting atomism in the\nfourteenth century was mounted by Thomas Bradwardine (c. 1290 \u2013\n1349). The purpose of his Tractatus de Continuo (c. 1330) was\nto \u201cprove that the opinion which maintains continua to be\ncomposed of indivisibles is false\u201d (Murdoch 1957: 54). This was\nto be achieved by setting forth a number of \u201cfirst\nprinciples\u201d concerning the continuum\u2014akin to the axioms\nand postulates of Euclid\u2019s Elements\u2014and then\ndemonstrating that the further assumption that a continuum is composed\nof indivisibles leads to absurdities (Murdoch 1957).\n\nThe views on the continuum of Nicolaus Cusanus (1401\u201364), a\nchampion of the actual infinite, are of considerable interest. In his\nDe Mente Idiotae of 1450, he asserts that any continuum, be\nit geometric, perceptual, or physical, is divisible in two senses, the\none ideal, the other actual. Ideal division \u201cprogresses to\ninfinity\u201d; actual division terminates in atoms after finitely\nmany steps (see Stones 1928: 447).\n\nCusanus\u2019s realist conception of the actual infinite is reflected\nin his quadrature of the circle (Boyer 1939 [1959: 91]). He took the\ncircle to be an infinilateral regular polygon, that is, a\nregular polygon with an infinite number of (infinitesimally short)\nsides. By dividing it up into a correspondingly infinite number of\ntriangles, its area, as for any regular polygon, can be computed as\nhalf the product of the apothem (in this case identical with the\nradius of the circle), and the perimeter. The idea of considering a\ncurve as an infinilateral polygon was employed by a number of later\nthinkers, for instance, Kepler, Galileo and Leibniz.\n\nThe early modern period saw the spread of knowledge in Europe of\nancient geometry, particularly that of Archimedes, and a loosening of\nthe Aristotelian grip on thinking. In regard to the problem of the\ncontinuum, the focus shifted away from metaphysics to technique, from\nthe problem of \u201cwhat indivisibles were, or\nwhether they composed magnitudes\u201d to \u201cthe new\nmarvels one could accomplish with them\u201d (Murdoch 1957:\n325) through the emerging calculus and mathematical analysis. Indeed,\ntracing the development of the continuum concept during this period is\ntantamount to charting the rise of the calculus. Traditionally,\ngeometry is the branch of mathematics concerned with the continuous\nand arithmetic (or algebra) with the discrete. The infinitesimal\ncalculus that took form in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\nwhich had as its primary subject matter continuous variation,\nmay be seen as a kind of synthesis of the continuous and the discrete,\nwith infinitesimals bridging the gap between the two. The widespread\nuse of indivisibles and infinitesimals in the analysis of continuous\nvariation by the mathematicians of the time testifies to the\naffirmation of a kind of mathematical atomism which, while logically\nquestionable, made possible the spectacular mathematical advances with\nwhich the calculus is associated. It was thus to be the infinitesimal,\nrather than the infinite, that served as the mathematical stepping\nstone between the continuous and the discrete.\n\nJohann Kepler (1571\u20131630) made abundant use of infinitesimals in\nhis calculations. In his Nova Stereometria of 1615, a work\nactually written as an aid in calculating the volumes of wine casks,\nhe regards curves as being infinilateral polygons, and solid bodies as\nbeing made up of infinitesimal cones or infinitesimally thin discs\n(Baron 1969 [1987: 108\u2013116]; Boyer 1939 [1959:\n106\u2013110]). Such uses are in keeping with Kepler\u2019s\ncustomary use of infinitesimals of the same dimension as the figures\nthey constitute; but he also used indivisibles on occasion. He spoke,\nfor example, of a cone as being composed of circles, and in\nhis Astronomia Nova of 1609, the work in which he states his\nfamous laws of planetary motion, he takes the area of an ellipse to be\nthe \u201csum of the radii\u201d drawn from the focus.\n\nIt seems to have been Kepler who first introduced the idea, which was\nlater to become a reigning principle in geometry, of continuous\nchange of a mathematical object, in this case, of a geometric\nfigure. In his Astronomiae pars Optica of 1604 Kepler notes\nthat all the conic sections are continuously derivable from one\nanother both through focal motion and by variation of the angle with\nthe cone of the cutting plane.\n\nGalileo Galilei (1564\u20131642) advocated a form of mathematical\natomism in which the influence of both the Democritean atomists and\nthe Aristotelian scholastics can be discerned. This emerges when one\nturns to the First Day of Galileo\u2019s Dialogues Concerning Two\nNew Sciences (1638). Salviati, Galileo\u2019s spokesman,\nmaintains, contrary to Bradwardine and the Aristotelians, that\ncontinuous magnitude is made up of indivisibles, indeed an infinite\nnumber of them. Salviati/Galileo recognizes that this infinity of\nindivisibles will never be produced by successive subdivision, but\nclaims to have a method for generating it all at once, thereby\nremoving it from the realm of the potential into actual realization:\nthis \u201cmethod for separating and resolving the whole of infinity\nat a single stroke\u201d (1638 [NE: 92\u201393; 1914: 48]) turns out\nsimply to the act of bending a straight line into a circle. Here\nGalileo finds an ingenious \u201cmetaphysical\u201d application of\nthe idea of regarding the circle as an infinilateral polygon. When the\nstraight line has been bent into a circle Galileo seems to take it\nthat that the line has thereby been rendered into indivisible parts,\nthat is, points. But if one considers that these parts are the sides\nof the infinilateral polygon, they are better characterized not as\nindivisible points, but rather as unbendable straight lines, each at\nonce part of and tangent to the\n circle.[15]\n Galileo does not mention this possibility, but nevertheless it does\nnot seem fanciful to detect the germ here of the idea of considering a\ncurve as a an assemblage of infinitesimal \u201cunbendable\u201d\nstraight\n lines.[16]\n\nIt was Galileo\u2019s pupil and colleague Bonaventura Cavalieri\n(1598\u20131647) who refined the use of indivisibles into a reliable\nmathematical tool (Boyer 1939 [1959]); indeed the \u201cmethod of\nindivisibles\u201d remains associated with his name to the present\nday. Cavalieri nowhere explains precisely what he understands by the\nword \u201cindivisible\u201d, but it is apparent that he conceived\nof a surface as composed of a multitude of equispaced parallel lines\nand of a volume as composed of equispaced parallel planes, these being\ntermed the indivisibles of the surface and the volume respectively.\nWhile Cavalieri recognized that these \u201cmultitudes\u201d of\nindivisibles must be unboundedly large, indeed was prepared to regard\nthem as being actually infinite, he avoided following Galileo into\nensnarement in the coils of infinity by grasping that, for the\n\u201cmethod of indivisibles\u201d to work, the precise\n\u201cnumber\u201d of indivisibles involved did not matter.\nIndeed, the essence of Cavalieri\u2019s method was the establishing\nof a correspondence between the indivisibles of two\n\u201csimilar\u201d configurations, and in the cases Cavalieri\nconsiders it is evident that the correspondence is suggested on solely\ngeometric grounds, rendering it quite independent of number. The very\nstatement of Cavalieri\u2019s principle embodies this idea: if plane\nfigures are included between a pair of parallel lines, and if their\nintercepts on any line parallel to the including lines are in a fixed\nratio, then the areas of the figures are in the same ratio. (An\nanalogous principle holds for solids.) Cavalieri\u2019s method is in\nessence that of reduction of dimension: solids are reduced to planes\nwith comparable areas and planes to lines with comparable lengths.\nWhile this method suffices for the computation of areas or volumes, it\ncannot be applied to rectify curves, since the reduction in this case\nwould be to points, and no meaning can be attached to the\n\u201cratio\u201d of two points. For rectification a curve has, it\nwas later realized, to be regarded as the sum, not of indivisibles,\nthat is, points, but rather of infinitesimal straight lines, its\nmicrosegments.\n\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) employed infinitesimalist\ntechniques, including Cavalieri\u2019s method of indivisibles, in his\nmathematical work. But he avoided the use of infinitesimals in the\ndetermination of tangents to curves, instead developing purely\nalgebraic methods for the purpose. Some of his sharpest criticism was\ndirected at those mathematicians, such as Fermat, who used\ninfinitesimals in the construction of tangents.\n\nAs a philosopher Descartes may be broadly characterized as a\nsynechist. His philosophical system rests on two fundamental\nprinciples: the celebrated Cartesian dualism\u2014the division\nbetween mind and matter\u2014and the less familiar identification of\nmatter and spatial extension. In the Meditations Descartes\ndistinguishes mind and matter on the grounds that the corporeal, being\nspatially extended, is divisible, while the mental is partless. The\nidentification of matter and spatial extension has the consequence\nthat matter is continuous and divisible without limit. Since extension\nis the sole essential property of matter and, conversely, matter\nalways accompanies extension, matter must be ubiquitous.\nDescartes\u2019 space is accordingly, as it was for the Stoics, a\nplenum pervaded by a continuous medium.\n\nThe concept of infinitesimal had arisen with problems of a geometric\ncharacter and infinitesimals were originally conceived as belonging\nsolely to the realm of continuous magnitude as opposed to that of\ndiscrete number. But from the algebra and analytic geometry of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries there issued the concept of\ninfinitesimal number. The idea first appears in the work of\nPierre de Fermat (1601\u201365) on the determination of maximum and\nminimum (extreme) values, published in 1638 (Boyer 1939 [1959: 155]).\n\nFermat\u2019s treatment of maxima and minima contains the germ of the\nfertile technique of \u201cinfinitesimal variation\u201d, that is,\nthe investigation of the behavior of a function by subjecting its\nvariables to small changes. Fermat applied this method in determining\ntangents to curves and centers of gravity.\n",
