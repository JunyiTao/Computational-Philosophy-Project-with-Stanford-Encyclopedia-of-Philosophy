    "main_text": "\n1. The Conventionality Thesis\n\n\nThe debate about the conventionality of simultaneity is usually\ncarried on within the framework of the special theory of relativity.\nEven prior to the advent of that theory, however, questions had been\nraised (see, e.g., Poincar\u00e9 1898) as to whether simultaneity\nwas absolute; i.e., whether there was a unique event at location A\nthat was simultaneous with a given event at location B. In his first\npaper on relativity, Einstein (1905) asserted that it was necessary to\nmake an assumption in order to be able to compare the times of\noccurrence of events at spatially separated locations (Einstein 1905,\n38\u201340 of the Dover translation or 125\u2013127 of the Princeton\ntranslation; but note Scribner 1963, for correction of an error in the\nDover translation). His assumption, which defined what is usually\ncalled standard synchrony, can be described in terms of the following\nidealized thought experiment, where the spatial locations A\nand B are fixed locations in some particular, but arbitrary,\ninertial (i.e., unaccelerated) frame of reference: Let a light ray,\ntraveling in vacuum, leave A at time t1\n(as measured by a clock at rest there), and arrive at B\ncoincident with the event E at B. Let the ray be\ninstantaneously reflected back to A, arriving at time\nt2.  Then standard synchrony is defined by saying\nthat E is simultaneous with the event at A that\noccurred at time (t1 +\nt2)/2. This definition is equivalent to the\nrequirement that the one-way speeds of the ray be the same on the two\nsegments of its round-trip journey between A and\nB.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note (as pointed out by Jammer (2006, 49), in his\ncomprehensive survey of virtually all aspects of simultaneity) that\nsomething closely analogous to Einstein\u2019s definition of standard\nsimultaneity was used more than 1500 years earlier by St. Augustine in\nhis Confessions (written in 397 CE). He was arguing against\nastrology by telling a story of two women, one rich and one poor, who\ngave birth simultaneously but whose children had quite different lives\nin spite of having identical horoscopes. His method of determining\nthat the births, at different locations, were simultaneous was to have\na messenger leave each birth site at the moment of birth and travel to\nthe other, presumably with equal speeds. Since the messengers met at\nthe midpoint, the births must have been simultaneous. Jammer comments\nthat this \u201cmay well be regarded as probably the earliest\nrecorded example of an operational definition of distant\nsimultaneity.\u201d\n\n\nThe thesis that the choice of standard synchrony is a convention,\nrather than one necessitated by facts about the physical universe\n(within the framework of the special theory of relativity), has been\nargued particularly by Reichenbach (see, for example, Reichenbach\n1958, 123\u2013135) and Gr\u00fcnbaum (see, for example,\nGr\u00fcnbaum 1973, 342\u2013368). They argue that the only\nnonconventional basis for claiming that two distinct events are not\nsimultaneous would be the possibility of a causal influence connecting\nthe events. In the pre-Einsteinian view of the universe, there was no\nreason to rule out the possibility of arbitrarily fast causal\ninfluences, which would then be able to single out a unique event\nat A that would be simultaneous with E. In an\nEinsteinian universe, however, no causal influence can travel faster\nthan the speed of light in vacuum, so from the point of view of\nReichenbach and Gr\u00fcnbaum, any event at A whose time of\noccurrence is in the open interval between t1 and\nt2 could be defined to be simultaneous\nwith E. In terms of the \u03b5-notation introduced by\nReichenbach, any event at A occurring at a\ntime t1 + \u03b5(t2 \u2212\nt1), where 0 < \u03b5 < 1, could be\nsimultaneous with E. That is, the conventionality thesis\nasserts that any particular choice of \u03b5 within its stated\nrange is a matter of convention, including the choice \u03b5=1/2\n(which corresponds to standard synchrony). If \u03b5 differs from\n1/2, the one-way speeds of a light ray would differ (in an\n\u03b5-dependent fashion) on the two segments of its round-trip\njourney between A and B. If, more generally, we\nconsider light traveling on an arbitrary closed path in\nthree-dimensional space, then (as shown by Minguzzi 2002,\n155\u2013156) the freedom of choice in the one-way speeds of light\namounts to the choice of an arbitrary scalar field (although two\nscalar fields that differ only by an additive constant would give the\nsame assignment of one-way speeds).\n\nIt might be argued that the definition of\nstandard synchrony makes use only of the relation of equality (of the\none-way speeds of light in different directions), so that simplicity\ndictates its choice rather than a choice that requires the\nspecification of a particular value for a parameter. Gr\u00fcnbaum\n(1973, 356) rejects this argument on the grounds that, since the\nequality of the one-way speeds of light is a convention, this choice\ndoes not simplify the postulational basis of the theory but only gives\na symbolically simpler representation.\n2. Phenomenological Counterarguments\n\n\nMany of the arguments against the conventionality thesis make use of\nparticular physical phenomena, together with the laws of physics, to\nestablish simultaneity (or, equivalently, to measure the one-way speed\nof light). Salmon (1977), for example, discusses a number of such\nschemes and argues that each makes use of a nontrivial convention. For\ninstance, one such scheme uses the law of conservation of momentum to\nconclude that two particles of equal mass, initially located halfway\nbetween A and B and then separated by an explosion,\nmust arrive at A and B\nsimultaneously. Salmon (1977, 273) argues,\nhowever, that the standard formulation of the law of conservation of\nmomentum makes use of the concept of one-way velocities, which cannot\nbe measured without the use of (something equivalent to) synchronized\nclocks at the two ends of the spatial interval that is traversed;\nthus, it is a circular argument to use conservation of momentum to\ndefine simultaneity.\n\n\nIt has been argued (see, for example, Janis 1983,  103\u2013105, and\nNorton 1986, 119) that all such schemes for establishing\nconvention-free synchrony must fail. The argument can be summarized as\nfollows: Suppose that clocks are set in standard synchrony, and\nconsider the detailed space-time description of the proposed\nsynchronization procedure that would be obtained with the use of such\nclocks. Next suppose that the clocks are reset in some nonstandard\nfashion (consistent with the causal order of events), and consider the\ndescription of the same sequence of events that would be obtained with\nthe use of the reset clocks. In such a description, familiar laws may\ntake unfamiliar forms, as in the case of the law of conservation of\nmomentum in the example mentioned above. Indeed, all of special\nrelativity has been reformulated (in an unfamiliar form) in terms of\nnonstandard synchronies (Winnie 1970a and 1970b). Since the proposed\nsynchronization procedure can itself be described in terms of a\nnonstandard synchrony, the scheme cannot describe a sequence of events\nthat is incompatible with nonstandard synchrony. A comparison of the\ntwo descriptions makes clear what hidden assumptions in the scheme are\nequivalent to standard synchrony. Nevertheless, editors of respected\njournals continue to accept, from time to time, papers purporting to\nmeasure one-way light speeds; see, for example, Greaves et\nal. (2009). Application of the procedure just described shows\nwhere their errors lie.\n3. Malament\u2019s Theorem\n\n\nFor a discussion of various proposals to establish synchrony, see the\nsupplementary document:\n\nTransport of Clocks\n\n\nThe only currently discussed proposal is based on a theorem of\nMalament (1977), who argues that standard synchrony is the only\nsimultaneity relation that can be defined, relative to a given\ninertial frame, from the relation of (symmetric) causal\nconnectibility. Let this relation be represented by \u03ba, let the\nstatement that events p and q are simultaneous be represented\nby S(p,q), and let the given inertial frame\nbe specified by the world line, O, of some inertial\nobserver. Then Malament\u2019s uniqueness theorem shows that if\nS is definable from \u03ba and O, if it is an\nequivalence relation, if points p on O and\nq not on O exist such that\nS(p,q) holds, and if S is not the\nuniversal relation (which holds for all points), then S is\nthe relation of standard synchrony.\n\n\nSome commentators have taken Malament\u2019s theorem to have settled\nthe debate on the side of nonconventionality. For example, Torretti\n(1983, 229) says, \u201cMalament proved that simultaneity by standard\nsynchronism in an inertial frame F is the only\nnon-universal equivalence between events at different points\nof F that is definable (\u2018in any sense of\n\u201cdefinable\u201d no matter how weak\u2019) in terms of causal\nconnectibility alone, for a given F\u201d; and Norton\n(Salmon et al. 1992, 222) says, \u201cContrary to most\nexpectations, [Malament] was able to prove that the central claim\nabout simultaneity of the causal theorists of time was false. He\nshowed that the standard simultaneity relation was the only nontrivial\nsimultaneity relation definable in terms of the causal structure of a\nMinkowski spacetime of special relativity.\u201d\n\n\nOther commentators disagree with such arguments, however.\nGr\u00fcnbaum (2010) has written a detailed critique of Malament\u2019s\npaper. He first cites Malament\u2019s need to postulate that S is an\nequivalence relation as a weakness in the argument, a view also\nendorsed by Redhead (1993, 114). Gr\u00fcnbaum\u2019s main argument,\nhowever, is based on an earlier argument by Janis (1983,\n107\u2013109) that Malament\u2019s theorem leads to a unique (but\ndifferent) synchrony relative to any inertial observer, that this\nlatitude is the same as that in introducing Reichenbach\u2019s \u03b5,\nand thus Malament\u2019s theorem should carry neither more nor less weight\nagainst the conventionality thesis than the argument\n(mentioned above in the last paragraph of the\nfirst section of this article) that standard synchrony is the simplest\nchoice. Gr\u00fcnbaum concludes \u201cthat Malament\u2019s remarkable\nproof has not undermined my thesis that, in the STR, relative\nsimultaneity is conventional, as contrasted with its\nnon-conventionality in the Newtonian world, which I have articulated!\nThus, I do not need to retract the actual claim I made in\n1963\u2026\u201d Somewhat similar arguments are given by Redhead\n(1993, 114) and by Debs and Redhead (2007, 87\u201392).\n\nFor further discussion, see the supplement document:\n\nFurther Discussion of Malament\u2019s Theorem\n\n4. Other Considerations\n\n\nSince the conventionality thesis rests upon the existence of a fastest\ncausal signal, the existence of arbitrarily fast causal signals would\nundermine the thesis. If we leave aside the question of causality, for\nthe moment, the possibility of particles (called tachyons) moving with\narbitrarily high velocities is consistent with the mathematical\nformalism of special relativity (see, for example, Feinberg 1967).\nJust as the speed of light in vacuum is an upper limit to the possible\nspeeds of ordinary particles (sometimes called bradyons), it would be\na lower limit to the speeds of tachyons. When a transformation is made\nto a different inertial frame of reference, the speeds of both\nbradyons and tachyons change (the speed of light in vacuum being the\nonly invariant speed). At any instant, the speed of a bradyon can be\ntransformed to zero and the speed of a tachyon can be transformed to\nan infinite value. The statement that a bradyon is moving forward in\ntime remains true in every inertial frame (if it is true in one), but\nthis is not so for tachyons. Feinberg (1967) argues that this does not\nlead to violations of causality through the exchange of tachyons\nbetween two uniformly moving observers because of ambiguities in the\ninterpretation of the behavior of tachyon emitters and absorbers,\nwhose roles can change from one to the other under the transformation\nbetween inertial frames. He claims to resolve putative causal\nanomalies by adopting the convention that each observer describes the\nmotion of each tachyon interacting with that observer\u2019s apparatus in\nsuch a way as to make the tachyon move forward in time. However, all\nof Feinberg\u2019s examples involve motion in only one spatial\ndimension. Pirani (1970) has given an explicit two-dimensional example\nin which Feinberg\u2019s convention is satisfied but a tachyon signal is\nemitted by an observer and returned to that observer at an earlier\ntime, thus leading to possible causal anomalies.\n\n\nA claim that no value of \u03b5 other than 1/2 is mathematically\npossible has been put forward by Zangari (1994). He argues that\nspin-1/2 particles (e.g., electrons) must be represented\nmathematically by what are known as complex spinors, and that the\ntransformation properties of these spinors are not consistent with the\nintroduction of nonstandard coordinates (corresponding to values of\n\u03b5 other than 1/2). Gunn and Vetharaniam (1995), however,\npresent a derivation of the Dirac equation (the fundamental equation\ndescribing spin-1/2 particles) using coordinates that are consistent\nwith arbitrary synchrony. They argue that Zangari mistakenly required\na particular representation of space-time points as the only one\nconsistent with the spinorial description of spin-1/2 particles.\n\n\nAnother argument for standard synchrony has been given by Ohanian (2004),\nwho bases his considerations on the laws of dynamics. He argues that a\nnonstandard choice of synchrony introduces pseudoforces into Newton\u2019s\nsecond law, which must hold in the low-velocity limit of special\nrelativity; that is, it is only with standard synchrony that net force\nand acceleration will be proportional.  Macdonald (2005) defends the\nconventionality thesis against this argument in a fashion analagous to\nthe argument used by Salmon (mentioned above in\nthe first paragraph of the second section of this article) against the\nuse of the law of conservation of momentum to define simultaneity:\nMacdonald says, in effect, that it is a convention to require Newton\u2019s\nlaws to take their standard form.\n\n\nMany of the arguments against conventionality involve viewing the\npreferred simultaneity relation as an equivalence relation that is\ninvariant under an appropriate transformation group.  Mamone Capria\n(2012) has examined the interpretation of simultaneity as an invariant\nequivalence relation in great detail, and argues that it does not have\nany bearing on the question of whether or not simultaneity is\nconventional in special relativity.\n\n\nA vigorous defense of conventionality has been offered by Rynasiewicz\n(2012). He argues that his approach \u201chas the merit of nailing\nthe exact sense in which simultaneity is conventional. It is\nconventional in precisely the same sense in which the gauge freedom\nthat arises in the general theory of relativity makes the choice\nbetween diffeomorphically related models conventional.\u201d He\nbegins by showing that any choice of a simultaneity relation is\nequivalent to a choice of a velocity in the equation for local time in\nH.A. Lorentz\u2019s Versuch theory (Lorentz 1895). Then, beginning\nwith Minkowski space with the standard Minkowski metric, he introduces\na diffeomorphism in which each point is mapped to a point with the\nsame spatial coordinates, but the temporal coordinate is that of a\nLorentzian local time expressed in terms of the velocity as a\nparameter. This mapping is not an isometry, for the light cones are\ntilted, which corresponds to anisotropic light propagation. He\nproceeds to argue, using the hole argument (see, for example, Earman\nand Norton 1987) as an analogy, that this parametric freedom is just\nlike the gauge freedom of general relativity.  As the tilting of the\nlight cones, if projected into a single spatial dimension, would be\nequivalent to a choice of Reichenbach\u2019s \u03b5, it seems that\nRynasiewicz\u2019s argument is a generalization and more completely argued\nversion of the argument given by Janis that is mentioned above in the\nthird paragraph of Section 3.\n\n\nThe debate about conventionality of simultaneity seems far from\nsettled, although some proponents on both sides of the argument might\ndisagree with that statement.
