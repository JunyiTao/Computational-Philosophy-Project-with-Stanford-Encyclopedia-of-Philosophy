This\nquestion is often times understood to frame the investigations at\nissue in Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason.

The answer to question\nthree is found in the Transcendental Dialectic, and it is a\nresoundingly blunt conclusion: the synthetic a priori\npropositions that characterize metaphysics are not really possible at\nall.

Preliminary Remarks: The Rejection of Ontology (general metaphysics) and the Transcendental Analytic\n\nDespite the fact that Kant devotes an entirely new section of the\nCritique to the branches of special metaphysics, his\ncriticisms reiterate some of the claims already defended in both the\nTranscendental Aesthetic and the Transcendental Analytic. Indeed, two\ncentral teachings from these earlier portions of the Critique\n\u2014 the transcendental ideality of space and time, and the\ncritical limitation of all application of the concepts of the\nunderstanding to \u201cappearances\u201d \u2014 already carry with\nthem Kant\u2019s rejection of \u201contology (metaphysica\ngeneralis).\u201d Accordingly, in the Transcendental Analytic\nKant argues against any attempt to acquire knowledge of \u201cobjects\nin general\u201d through the formal concepts and principles of the\nunderstanding, taken by themselves alone. In this connection, Kant\ndenies that the principles or rules of either general logic (e.g., the\nprinciple of contradiction), or those of his own \u201ctranscendental\nlogic\u201d (the pure concepts of the understanding) by\nthemselves yield knowledge of objects. These claims follow from\nKant\u2019s well-known \u201ckind distinction\u201d between the\nunderstanding and sensibility, together with the view that knowledge\nrequires the cooperation of both faculties. This position, articulated\nthroughout the Analytic, entails that independently of their\napplication to intuitions, the concepts and principles of the\nunderstanding are mere forms of thought which cannot yield knowledge\nof objects.\n\nFor if no intuition could be given corresponding to the concept, the\nconcept would still be a thought, so far as its form is concerned, but\nwould be without any object, and no knowledge of anything would be\npossible by means of it. So far as I could know, there would be\nnothing, and could be nothing, to which my thought could be applied.\nB146\n\n\nWe thus find one general complaint about efforts to acquire\nmetaphysical knowledge: the use of formal concepts and principles, in\nabstraction from the sensible conditions under which objects can be\ngiven, cannot yield knowledge. Hence, the \u201ctranscendental\u201d\nuse of the understanding (its use independently of the conditions of\nsensibility) is considered by Kant to be dialectical, to involve\nerroneous applications of concepts in order to acquire knowledge of\nthings independently of sensibility/experience. Throughout the\nAnalytic Kant elaborates on this general view, noting that the\ntranscendental employment of the understanding, which aims towards\nknowledge of things independently of experience (and thus knowledge of\n\u201cnoumena\u201d), is illicit (cf. A246/B303). It is in this\nconnection that Kant states, famously, in the Analytic, that\n\u201c\u2026the proud name of ontology, which presumes to offer\nsynthetic a priori cognitions of things in general\u2026\nmust give way to the more modest title of a transcendental\nanalytic\u201d (cf. A247/B304). Filling this out, Kant suggests that\nto take ourselves to have unmediated intellectual access to objects\n(to have \u201cnon-sensible\u201d knowledge) correlates with the\nassumption that there are non-sensible objects that we can know. To\nassume this, however, is to conflate \u201cphenomena\u201d (or\nappearances) with \u201cnoumena\u201d (or things in themselves). The\nfailure to draw the distinction between appearances and things in\nthemselves is the hallmark of all those pernicious systems of thought\nthat stand under the title of \u201ctranscendental realism.\u201d\nKant\u2019s transcendental idealism is the remedy for these.\n2. The Rejection of Special Metaphysics and the Transcendental Dialectic\n\nKant\u2019s rejection of the more specialized branches of metaphysics\nis grounded in part on this earlier claim, to wit, that any attempt to\napply the concepts and principles of the understanding independently\nof the conditions of sensibility (i.e., any transcendental use of the\nunderstanding) is illicit. Thus, one of Kant\u2019s main complaints\nis that metaphysicians seek to deduce a priori synthetic\nknowledge simply from the unschematized (pure) concepts of the\nunderstanding. The effort to acquire metaphysical knowledge through\nconcepts alone, however, is doomed to fail, according to Kant, because\n(in its simplest formulation) \u201cconcepts without intuitions are\nempty\u201d (A52/B76).\n\nAlthough this general charge is certainly a significant part of\nKant\u2019s complaint, the story does not stop there. In turning to\nthe specific disciplines of special metaphysics (those concerning the\nsoul, the world, and God), Kant devotes a considerable amount of time\ndiscussing the human interests that nevertheless pull us into the\nthorny questions and controversies that characterize special\nmetaphysics. These interests are of two types, and include theoretical\ngoals of achieving completeness and systematic unity of knowledge, and\npractical interests in securing the immortality of the soul, freedom,\nand the existence of God. Despite their contributions to metaphysical\nillusion, Kant tells us that the goals and interests in question are\nunavoidable, inevitable, and inherent in the very nature of human\nreason. In the Introduction to the Transcendental Dialectic Kant thus\nintroduces \u201creason\u201d as the locus of these metaphysical\ninterests.\n2.1 The Theory of Reason and Transcendental Illusion\n\nThe emphasis on reason in this connection is important, and it links\nup with the project of Kant\u2019s \u201ccritique\u201d of pure\nreason. A major component of this critique involves illuminating the\nbasis in reason for our efforts to draw erroneous metaphysical\nconclusions (to employ concepts \u201ctranscendentally\u201d),\ndespite the fact that such use has already been shown (in the\nTranscendental Analytic) to be illicit. What emerges in the Dialectic\nis a more complex story, one in which Kant seeks to disclose and\ncritique the \u201ctranscendental ground\u201d that leads to the\nmisapplications of thought which characterize specific metaphysical\narguments. In developing the position that our metaphysical\npropensities are grounded in the \u201cvery nature of human\nreason,\u201d Kant (in the Introduction to the Dialectic) relies on a\nconception of reason as a capacity for syllogistic reasoning. This\nlogical function of reason resides in the formal activity of subsuming\npropositions under ever more general principles in order to\nsystematize, unify, and \u201cbring to completion\u201d the\nknowledge given through the real use of the understanding\n(A306/B363-A308/B365). Kant thus characterizes this activity as one\nwhich seeks \u201cconditions\u201d for everything that is\nconditioned. It is therefore central to this Kantian conception of\nreason that it is preoccupied with the \u201cunconditioned which\nwould stop the regress of conditions by providing a condition that is\nnot itself conditioned in its turn.\u201d\n\nThe demand for the unconditioned is essentially a demand for ultimate\nexplanation, and links up with the rational prescription to secure\nsystematic unity and completeness of knowledge. Reason, in short, is\nin the business of ultimately accounting for all things. As Kant\nformulates this interest of reason in the first Critique, it\nis characterized by the logical maxim or precept: \u201cFind for\nthe conditioned knowledge given through the understanding the\nunconditioned whereby its unity is brought to completion\u201d\n(A308/B364). It is central to Kant\u2019s Dialectic that this\nrequirement for systematic unity and completeness of knowledge is\ninherent in the very nature of our reason. Controversially, Kant does\nnot take it that this demand for the unconditioned is something we can\ndismiss, nor does he take the interests we have in metaphysics to be\nmerely products of misguided enthusiasm.\n\nAlthough the demand for the unconditioned is inherent in the very\nnature of our reason, although it is unavoidable and indispensably\nnecessary, Kant nevertheless does not take it to be without problems\nof a unique sort; for the very same demand that guides our rational\nscientific inquiries and defines our (human) reason is also the locus\nof error that needs to be curbed or prevented. In connection with this\nprinciple, then, Kant also identifies reason as the seat of a unique\nkind of error, one that is essentially linked up with metaphysical\npropensities, and one which he refers to as \u201ctranscendental\nillusion [transzendentale Illusion].\u201d Kant identifies\ntranscendental illusion with the propensity to \u201ctake a\nsubjective necessity of a connection of our concepts\u2026for an\nobjective necessity in the determination of things in\nthemselves\u201d (A297/B354). Very generally, Kant\u2019s claim is\nthat it is a peculiar feature of reason that it unavoidably takes its\nown subjective interests and principles to hold\n\u201cobjectively.\u201d And it is this propensity, this\n\u201ctranscendental illusion,\u201d according to Kant, that paves\nthe way for metaphysics. Reason plays this role by generating\nprinciples and interests that incite us to defy the limitations of\nknowledge already detailed in the Transcendental Analytic. The\nIntroduction to the Transcendental Dialectic is therefore interesting\nfor Kant\u2019s presentation of reason as a presumably distinct\ncapacity for cognizing in a way that, as Kant puts it, incites us to\ntear down the boundaries already enforced in the Analytic (cf.\nA296/B352). Kant refers to this capacity of reason as one that leads\nto the specifically transcendent judgments that characterize\nmetaphysics. Thus, the Transcendental Dialectic is said to be\nconcerned \u201cto expose the illusion in transcendent\njudgments\u201d (A297/B354). Indeed, Dialectic is defined as\n\u201cthe logic of illusion [Schein]\u201d (A293/B350).\n\nThe central problem is that the above prescription to seek\nthe unconditioned presents to reason as a metaphysical principle that\ntells us that the unconditioned is already given, and is (as\nit were) \u201cthere\u201d to be found. This problematic principle\nis formulated by Kant as follows: \u201cIf the conditioned is\ngiven, the absolutely unconditioned\u2026 is also given\u201d\n(A308/B366). This \u201csupreme principle of pure reason\u201d\nprovides the background assumption under which the metaphysician\nproceeds. These claims set the agenda for Kant\u2019s project, which\ninvolves showing not simply that the metaphysical arguments are\nfallacious, but also exposing their source in reason\u2019s more\ngeneral illusions.\n\nKant has been traditionally taken to be offering a method of avoiding\nthe insidious \u201ctranscendental illusion\u201d that gives rise to\nmetaphysics. Read in this way, Kant\u2019s Dialectic offers a\ncriticism not only of the specific arguments of metaphysics, but also\nof transcendent, metaphysical (speculative or theoretical)\ninterests and propensities themselves. This certainly accords\nwith much in the Dialectic, and specifically with Kant\u2019s\nwell-known claim that knowledge has to be limited to possible\nexperience. Kant, however, complicates things somewhat by also stating\nrepeatedly that the illusion that grounds metaphysics (roughly, that\nthe unconditioned is already given) is unavoidable. Moreover, Kant\nsometimes suggests that such illusion is somehow necessary for our\nepistemological projects (cf. A645/B673). In this connection, Kant\nargues that the transcendent ideas and principles of reason do have a\npositive role to play in knowledge acquisition, so long as they are\nconstrued \u201cregulatively\u201d and not\n\u201cconstitutively.\u201d He thus suggests that rather than\njettison the ideas of metaphysical objects (something, it seems, he\ndoes not think we are in a position to do), it is best to identify the\nproper use and function of these ideas and principles. This critical\nreinterpretation involves the claim that the ideas and principles of\nreason are to be used \u201cregulatively,\u201d as devices for\nguiding and grounding our empirical investigations and the project of\nknowledge acquisition. What the ideas do not do, according to Kant, is\nprovide the concepts through which we might access objects that could\nbe known through the speculative use of reason.\n\nThe need for this critical reinterpretation stems from the fact that\nreason\u2019s demand for the unconditioned cannot be met or\nsatisfied. The absolutely \u201cunconditioned,\u201d regardless of\nthe fact that it presents to reason as objective, is not an object or\nstate of affairs that could be captured in any possible human\nexperience. In emphasizing this last point, Kant identifies\nmetaphysics with an effort to acquire knowledge of\n\u201cobjects\u201d conceived, but in no wise given (or giveable) to\nus in experience. In its efforts to bring knowledge to completion,\nthat is, reason posits certain ideas, the \u201csoul,\u201d the\n\u201cworld\u201d and \u201cGod.\u201d Each of these ideas\nrepresents reason\u2019s efforts to think the unconditioned in\nrelation to various sets of objects that are experienced by us as\nconditioned.\n\nIt is this general theory of reason, as a capacity to think (by means\nof \u201cideas\u201d) beyond all standards of sense, and as carrying\nwith it a unique and unavoidable demand for the unconditioned, that\nframes the Kantian rejection of metaphysics. At the heart of that\nrejection is the view that although reason is unavoidably motivated to\nseek the unconditioned, its theoretical efforts to achieve it are\ninevitably sterile. The ideas which might secure such unconditioned\nknowledge lack objective reality (refer to no object), and our\nmisguided efforts to acquire ultimate metaphysical knowledge are led\nastray by the illusion which, according to Kant, \u201cunceasingly\nmocks and torments us\u201d (A339/B397).\n\nThe Dialectic is concerned to undermine three distinct branches of\nspecial metaphysics in the philosophical tradition: Rational\nPsychology, Rational Cosmology and Rational Theology. Each of these\ndisciplines seeks to acquire knowledge of a particular metaphysical\n\u201cobject\u201d \u2014 the \u201csoul,\u201d the\n\u201cworld,\u201d and \u201cGod,\u201d respectively. This being\nstated, the Dialectic proceeds systematically to undermine the\narguments specific to each of these disciplines\u2014arguments about,\nfor example, the nature of the soul and the world, and the existence\nof God. Despite the difference in their objects, however, there are a\nnumber of problems shared by all the disciplines of special\nmetaphysics. In its most general terms, the central problem with each\nof these attempts has to do with the fact that the alleged\n\u201cobjects\u201d under consideration are\n\u201ctranscendent.\u201d Although we think the soul, the world, and\nGod (necessarily) as objects, these ideas actually lack\nobjective reality (there is no object corresponding to the ideas that\nis or could be given to us in any intuition). It is thus not uncommon\nto find Kant referring to these alleged metaphysical entities as\n\u201cmere thought entities,\u201d \u201cfictions of the\nbrain,\u201d or \u201cpseudo objects.\u201d Although the Dialectic\ndoes not presume to prove that such objects do not or could not exist,\nKant is committed by the strictures of his own transcendental\nepistemology to the claim that the ideas of reason do not provide us\nwith concepts of \u201cknowable\u201d objects. For this reason\nalone, the efforts of the metaphysicians are presumptuous, and at the\nvery least, an epistemological modesty precludes the knowledge that is\nsought.\n\nFor more on Kant\u2019s theory of illusion, see Allison (2004), Butts\n(1997), Grier (2001, forthcoming), Neiman (1994), Theis (1985), Bird (2006).\nSee also Ameriks (2006), Dyck (2014).\n2.2 Hypostatization and Subreption\n\nThere are two noteworthy themes implicit in Kant\u2019s criticism of\nmetaphysics. First, Kant offers an account and critique of the ideas\nof reason specific to each discipline. In relation to this, the\ngeneral theory of reason plays a role in Kant\u2019s efforts to argue\nagainst the \u201chypostatization\u201d of each of the ideas. More\nspecifically, Kant\u2019s criticism of the metaphysical disciplines\ncenters on his efforts to show that the ideas of reason (the soul, the\nworld and God), which are thought in accordance with the demand for an\nunconditioned that could unify the relevant domain of conditions, get\nerroneously \u201chypostatized\u201d by reason, or thought as\nmind-independent \u201cobjects\u201d about which we might seek\nknowledge. In the same way, that is, that the prescription to seek the\nunconditioned appears to reason as an objective principle, so too, the\nsubjective ideas appear to reason as objects existing in a\nmind-independent way. Kant\u2019s aim is to secure the subjective\nideas while enforcing their subjective status, and thereby defusing\nthe metaphysics that attends to them.\n\nThus, Kant\u2019s criticism of metaphysics simultaneously involves\ndenying the pure use of theoretical reason as an instrument for\nknowledge of transcendent objects, and defending\nreason\u2019s ideas as projections or goals that have some\nsignificant role to play in the overall project of knowledge\nacquisition. As we shall see, Kant unfortunately is not as clear as we\nmight like on this issue. Sometimes, he seems to argue that the ideas\nand principles of reason play a merely heuristic role in guiding and\nsystematizing the knowledge already obtained. Other times, he suggests\nthat these ideas are deeply essential to the project of knowledge\nacquisition, and that their presupposition is utterly necessary if we\nare to acquire knowledge. Regardless of how the matter is to be\nresolved, it is clear that Kant\u2019s criticism of metaphysics does\nnot entail any straightforward rejection of the ideas and principles\nof reason. Indeed, it appears to be precisely the rational constraint\nto move to the ideas of reason that binds us to our metaphysical\npropensities and which thus demands a critique of the kind offered by\nKant.\n\nIn addition to criticizing the \u201chypostatization\u201d of the\nideas of reason, Kant seeks to expose the \u201csubreptions\u201d\ninvolved in the use of the ideas. The term \u201csubreption\u201d\nrefers to a fallacy that specifically involves the surreptitious\nsubstitution of different kinds of terms and concepts. Kant\nusually uses the term to refer to the error of confusing or\nsubstituting concepts and principles meant for use in experience\n(those which properly apply to appearances) with principles of\n\u201cpure reason.\u201d By this means, a concept or principle which\nis a condition of our experience (e.g., the principle of apperception)\nis used in a way that assumes its applications to \u201cobjects in\ngeneral\u201d or things in themselves. Alternatively, a most general,\nformal, principle that would only hold for things in general is taken,\nby itself alone, to yield knowledge about appearances. This second\nkind of criticism found throughout the Dialectic thus pertains to\nKant\u2019s efforts to expose the subreptions that ground the\nillusory metaphysical arguments. Ultimately, Kant will also\nseek to reveal the very specific formal fallacies that vitiate the\nmetaphysical arguments, to demonstrate that (although they have the\nappearance of soundness) the positions in each case are implicitly\ngrounded in, or deploy, dialectical uses of terms and concepts,\nmisapplications of principles, and conflations of appearances with\nthings in themselves. What we find in Kant\u2019s criticism of\nmetaphysics, in other words, is a complex account, one grounded in a\nfairly robust theory of human reason. Accordingly, he identifies\nreason as the locus of certain principles and propensities, and\ncertain \u201cillusions,\u201d which cooperate with misapplications\nof concepts and principles to create the errors already exposed in the\nTranscendental Analytic. Although this variety of aims and complaints\ncertainly complicates Kant\u2019s discussions in the Dialectic, it\nalso makes for a richer and more penetrating criticism of\nmetaphysics.\n3. The Soul and Rational Psychology\n\nOne historically predominant metaphysical interest has to do with\nidentifying the nature and the constitution of the soul. Partly for\npractical reasons, partly for theoretical explanation, reason forms\nthe idea of a metaphysically simple being, the soul. Such an idea is\nmotivated by reason\u2019s demand for the unconditioned. Kant puts\nthis point in a number of ways, suggesting that the idea of the soul\nis one to which we are led necessarily insofar as we are constrained\nby reason to seek the \u201ctotality\u201d of the \u201csynthesis\nof conditions of a thought in general\u201d (A397), or insofar as we\nseek to represent \u201cthe unconditioned unity\u201d of\n\u201csubjective conditions of representations in general\u201d\n(A406/B433). More straightforwardly, Kant states that a metaphysics of\nthe soul is generated by the demand for the \u201cabsolute\n(unconditioned) unity of the thinking subject itself\u201d\n(A334/B391). The branch of metaphysics devoted to this topic is\nRational Psychology. Rational psychologists, among whom Descartes or\nLeibniz would serve as apt historical examples, seek to demonstrate,\nfor example, the substantiality, simplicity, and personal identity of\nthe soul. Each such inference, however, involves concluding\n\u201cfrom the transcendental concept of the subject, which contains\nnothing manifold, the absolute unity of this subject itself, of which\nI possess no concept whatsoever\u201d (A340/B398). In other words,\nKant takes the rational psychologist to slide (mistakenly) from formal\nfeatures of our self concept to material or substantive metaphysical\nclaims about an alleged (super-sensible) object (the soul).\n\nAn essential aspect of all these arguments, according to Kant, is\ntheir attempt to derive conclusions about the nature and constitution\nof the \u201csoul\u201d a priori, simply from an analysis\nof the activity of thinking. A classic example of such an attempt is\nprovided by Descartes, who deduced the substantiality of the self from\nthe proposition (or, perhaps better, the activity) \u201cI\nthink.\u201d This move is apparent in the Cartesian inference from\n\u201cI think\u201d to the claim that the \u201cI\u201d is\ntherefore \u201ca thing\u201d that thinks. For Descartes, this move\nis unproblematic: thought is an attribute, and thus presupposes a\nsubstance in which it inheres. Kant emphasizes the a priori\nbasis for the metaphysical doctrine of the soul by claiming that in\nrational psychology, the \u201cI think\u201d is supposed to provide\nthe \u201csole text\u201d (A343\u20134/B401\u201302). It is this\nfeature of the discipline that serves to distinguish it from any\nempirical doctrine of the self (any empirical psychology), and which\nsecures its status as a \u201cmetaphysics\u201d that purports to\nprovide synthetic a priori knowledge.\n\nKant\u2019s criticisms of rational psychology draw on a number of\ndistinct sources, one of which is the Kantian doctrine of\napperception, or transcendental self-consciousness (often formulated\nin terms of the necessary possibility of attaching the \u201cI\nthink\u201d to all my representations (B132)). Kant denies that the\nmetaphysician is entitled to his substantive conclusions on the\ngrounds that the activity of self-consciousness does not yield any\nobject for thought. Nevertheless, reason is guided by its projecting\nand objectifying propensities. In accordance with these,\nself-consciousness is \u201chypostatized,\u201d or objectified. Here\nagain, Kant claims that a \u201cnatural illusion\u201d compels us to\ntake the apperceived unity of consciousness as an intuition of an\nobject (A402). The ineliminably subjective nature of\nself-consciousness, and the elusiveness of the \u201cI\u201d in the\ncontext of that activity, are thus the well known bases for\nKant\u2019s response to rational psychology, and the doctrine of\napperception plays an important role in Kant\u2019s rejection. For in\neach case, Kant thinks that a feature of self-consciousness (the\nessentially subjectival, unitary and identical nature of the\n\u201cI\u201d of apperception) gets transmuted into a metaphysics of\na self (as an object) that is ostensibly \u201cknown\u201d through\nreason alone to be substantial, simple, identical, etc. This slide\nfrom the \u201cI\u201d of apperception to the constitution of an\nobject (the soul) has received considerable attention in the secondary\nliterature, and has fueled a great deal of attention to the Kantian\ntheory of mind and mental activity.\n\nThe claim that the \u2018I\u2019 of apperception yields no object of\nknowledge (for it is not itself an object, but only the\n\u201cvehicle\u201d for any representation of objectivity as such)\nis fundamental to Kant\u2019s critique of rational psychology. Kant\nthus spends a considerable amount of time arguing that no object is\ngiven in transcendental self-consciousness, and thus that the rational\npsychologist\u2019s efforts to discern features of the self,\nconstrued as a metaphysical entity, through reason alone are without\nmerit. To elucidate the ways in which the rational psychologist is\nnevertheless seduced into making this slide from formal\nrepresentations of self consciousness to a metaphysics of the self,\nKant examines each of the psychological arguments, maintaining that\nall such arguments about the soul are dialectical. He refers to the\narguments designed to draw such conclusions, \u201ctranscendental\nparalogisms\u201d, and hence the chapter of the Critique that\ncriticizes rational psychology goes by the name \u201cThe Paralogisms\nof Pure Reason.\u201d A transcendental paralogism, according to Kant,\nis a \u201csyllogism in which one is constrained, by a transcendental\nground, to draw a formally invalid conclusion\u201d (A341/B399).\nKant\u2019s subsequent efforts are thus directed towards\ndemonstrating the paralogistic (fallacious) nature of the arguments\nabout the soul.\n\nKant\u2019s diagnosis of the fallacies has received considerable\nattention, and has generated considerable controversy. In each case,\nKant tells us, the argument is guilty of the fallacy of sophisma\nfigurae dictionis, or the fallacy of\nequivocation/ambiguous middle. Kant suggests that in each of the\nsyllogisms, a term is used in different senses in the major and minor\npremises. Consider the first paralogism, the argument that allegedly\ndeduces the substantiality of the soul. In the A edition, Kant\nformulates the argument as follows:\n\n\nThat the representation of which is the absolute subject of our\njudgments and cannot be employed as determination of any other thing,\nis substance.\n\nI, as thinking being, am the absolute subject of all my possible\njudgments and this representation of myself cannot be employed as\ndetermination of any other thing.\n\nTherefore, I, as thinking being (soul), am substance. (A349)\n\n\nKant locates the equivocation contained in the argument in the use of\nthe term \u201csubstance.\u201d According to Kant, the major premise\nuses this term \u201ctranscendentally\u201d whereas the minor\npremise and conclusion use the same term \u201cempirically.\u201d\n(A403). What Kant appears to mean is this: the major premise deploys\nthe term \u201csubstance\u201d in a very general way, one which\nabstracts from the conditions of our sensible intuition (space and\ntime). As such, the major premise simply offers the most general\ndefinition of substance, and thus expresses the most general rule in\naccordance with which objects might be able to be thought as\nsubstances. Nevertheless, in order to apply the concept of substance\nin such a way as to determine an object, the category would have to be\nused empirically. Unfortunately, such an empirical use is precluded by\nthe fact that the alleged object to which it is being applied is not\nempirical. Even more problematically, on Kant\u2019s view, there is\nno object given at all. In Kantian jargon, the category only\nyields knowledge of objects if it is \u201cschematized,\u201d\napplied to given objects under the conditions of time.\n\nThis same kind of complaint is lodged against each of the paralogistic\nsyllogisms that characterize Rational Psychology. Thus, Kant argues\nagainst the inference to the simplicity of the soul, by remarking that\nthe psychologist surreptitiously deduces the actual simplicity of a\nmetaphysical object simply from the formal features of subjectivity\n(the fact that the \u201cI\u201d is unitary in our representational\neconomy). The personal identity of the soul is attacked on similar\ngrounds. In each case the metaphysical conclusion is said to be drawn\nonly by an equivocation in the use or meaning of a concept of the\nunderstanding.\n\nThis illustrates Kant\u2019s efforts to demonstrate the fallacious\nnature of the arguments that characterize metaphysics, as well as his\ninterest in identifying the sources of such errors. Given this,\nKant\u2019s criticisms of rational psychology are not as\nstraightforward as one might expect, for embedded in his criticisms of\nrational psychology are actually a number of distinct charges: 1) The\nidea of the soul, although it is one to which we are naturally led in\nour quest for the unconditioned ground of thought, does not correspond\nto any object that is (or could be) actually given to us in\nintuition. The hypostatization of this idea, therefore, although it\nmay be natural, is deeply problematic. 2) Because the idea of the soul\ndoes not yield, by itself alone, any knowable object, the arguments\nabout it, although they may have the appearance of being legitimate,\nin fact involve dialectical applications of concepts. The arguments,\nin other words, involve fallacies that vitiate their conclusions. 3)\nThe arguments are traceable back to certain features of human reason\nthat may not be eradicated, but that can and ought to be curbed and\ncritically reinterpreted. More specifically, the demand for the\nunconditioned, and the idea of the soul to which it gives rise, may be\nconstrued regulatively as devices for guiding inquiries, but never\nconstitutively \u2014 never, that is, as yielding grounds for any a\npriori synthetic knowledge of a metaphysical self given immediately to\npure reason.\n\nKant\u2019s Paralogisms have received considerable and focused\nattention in the secondary literature. See Ameriks (1992), Brook\n(1994), Kitcher, Patricia (1990), Powell (1990), Sellars (1969, 1971),\nWolff, R. P. (1963). There are also excellent discussions to be found\nin Allison (1983, 2004), Bennett (1974), Buroker (2006), Grier (2001,\nforthcoming), Guyer (1987), Wuerth (2010, 2021) (2010), Bird (2006), Ameriks\n(2006), Melnick (2006), Dyck (2014), Proops (2010), Willaschek (2018)\n4. The World and Rational Cosmology\n\nThe second discipline of rationalist metaphysics rejected by Kant is\nRational Cosmology. Rational cosmology is concerned with the arguments\nabout the nature and constitution of the \u201cworld,\u201d\nunderstood as the sum-total of all appearances (objects and events in\nspace and time) (A420/B448). The arguments about the world occupy an\nespecially important place in Kant\u2019s rejection of metaphysics.\nNot only does Kant address himself to the task of discounting the\nmetaphysical arguments in cosmology, but the resolution to some of\nthese conflicts provides, he claims, an indirect argument for his own\ntranscendental idealism.\n\nThe arguments about the world are referred to by Kant as\n\u201cantinomies\u201d because in the field of cosmology, reason\ngives rise to sets of opposing arguments (the \u201cthesis\u201d and\nthe \u201cantithesis\u201d) with respect to each issue. Thus, the\ncase here differs from the paralogisms (and, as we shall see, from the\nIdeal). The reason for this difference resides in the nature of the\nidea of reason in question. The idea of the \u201cworld\u201d\npurports to be an idea of an unconditioned but somehow still sensible\nobject (cf. A479/B509). Unlike the soul and God, which are clearly\nsupposed to be non-sensible metaphysical entities, the sum total of\nall appearances refers specifically to spatio-temporal objects or\nevents. Kant highlights this unique feature of the idea of the world\nby noting that whereas the ideas of the soul and God are\n\u201cpseudo-rational,\u201d the idea of the world is\n\u201cpseudo-empirical.\u201d It is precisely this feature of the\nidea (that it both purports to refer to a somehow sensible object AND\nthat it involves thinking that object as already given in its\nunconditioned totality) that leads to the two opposed sets of\narguments. For with respect to each problem addressed (the finitude\nvs. the infinitude of the world, freedom vs. causality, etc.), one can\neither adopt a broadly \u201cdogmatic\u201d (Platonic) or broadly\n\u201cempiricist\u201d (Epicurean) approach, each reflecting a\ndifferent way of thinking the totality of conditions (See\nA471\u20132/B499\u2013500). More specifically, one can either think\nthe unconditioned as an intelligible ground of appearances, or as the\ntotal (even if infinite) set of all appearances. Unfortunately, each\nof these conceptual strategies is unsatisfying. To accommodate the\nthesis interest in ultimate (intelligible) beginnings is to posit\nsomething \u201ctoo big\u201d for the understanding, something that\nis never to be met with empirically (e.g., freedom, ultimately simple\nsubstances). Thus, although the thesis positions satisfy\nreason\u2019s demand for the unconditioned, they do so by fleeing\n(however unwittingly) into an intelligible realm, by providing\nexplanations that abstract from that which is or could be given in any\nspatio-temporal experience. But adopting the empiricist approach is no\nmore rewarding, in the final analysis; although the antithesis\npositions remain securely lodged within \u201cnature\u2019s own\nresources,\u201d they can never measure up to the demands of\nreason\u2019s ideas. Such a strategy is \u201ctoo small\u201d for\nreason which, even despite its capacity to think beyond all standards\nof sense and by its demand for more thorough explanation. Worse, the\nantithesis arguments, in refusing to go beyond the spatio-temporal\nrealm, end up being just as dogmatic as their opposites, for the\nassumption is that whatever holds within space and time also holds\ngenerally. To assume this is to take what are for Kant merely\nsubjective features of our intuition (forms of sensibility, space and\ntime) to be universal ontological conditions holding of everything\nwhatsoever. \n\nBecause both sides to the cosmological disputes seem to be able to\nargue successfully against the opposite, Kant finds in the antinomies\na dramatic exhibition of the \u201cconflict\u201d into which reason\ninevitably falls (and in which it will remain) so long as it fails to\nadopt his own transcendental distinction between appearances and\nthings in themselves. The historical debacle of reason\u2019s\nconflict with itself provides Kant with a dramatic exhibition of the\nvacillation of reason between two alternatives, neither of which it\ncan accept (or dismiss) without dissatisfaction. Left unresolved, this\nconflict leads to the \u201ceuthanasia of pure reason\u201d\n(A407/B434), in the sense of provoking skeptical despair.\n4.1 The Mathematical Antinomies\n\nThere are four \u201cantinomies\u201d of pure reason, and Kant\ndivides them into two classes. The first two antinomies are dubbed\n\u201cmathematical\u201d antinomies, presumably because in each\ncase, we are concerned with the relation between what are alleged to\nbe sensible objects (either the world itself, or objects in it) and\nspace and time. An important and fundamental aspect of Kant\u2019s\nrejection of each of these sets of arguments rests on his view that\neach of these conflicts is traceable back to a fundamental error, an\nerror that can be discerned, according to Kant, in the following\ndialectical syllogism:\n\n\nIf the conditioned is given, then the whole series of conditions, a\nseries which is therefore itself absolutely unconditioned, is also\ngiven\n\nObjects of the senses are given as conditioned\n\nConsequently, the entire series of all conditions of objects of the\nsenses is already given. (cf. A497/B525).\n\n\nThere are a number of problems with this argument, according to Kant.\nObviously, one problem is located in the major premise, in the\nassumption that the unconditioned is \u201calready given.\u201d The\nproblem, maintains Kant, is that such a totality is never to be met\nwith in experience. The rational assumption that the total series of\nall conditions is already given would hold only for things in\nthemselves. In the realm of appearances, the totality is never given\nto us, as finite discursive knowers. The most we are entitled to say,\nwith respect to appearances, is that the unconditioned is set as a\ntask, that there is a rational prescription to continue to seek\nexplanations (A498/B526-A500/B528). As finite (sensible) cognizers,\nhowever, we shall never achieve an absolute completion of knowledge.\nTo assume that we can do so is to adopt the theocentric model of\nknowledge characteristic of the dreaded transcendental realist.\n\nThis hypostatization of the idea of the world, the fact that it is\ntaken to be a mind-independent object, acts as the underlying\nassumption motivating both parties to the two mathematical antinomies.\nThe first antinomy concerns the finitude or infinitude of the\nspatio-temporal world. The thesis argument seeks to show that the\nworld in space and time is finite, i.e., has a beginning in time and a\nlimit in space. The antithesis counters that it is infinite with\nregard to both space and time. The second antinomy concerns the\nultimate constitution of objects in the world, with the thesis arguing\nfor ultimately simple substances, whereas the antithesis argues that\nobjects are infinitely divisible. In this, the thesis positions are\neach concerned to bring the explanatory effort to a close, by arguing\nfor ultimate or, as Kant says, \u201cintelligible beginnings\u201d\n(cf. A466/B494). The claim that there is a \u201cfirst\nbeginning\u201d or an ultimately simple substance is sustained only\nby abstracting from the spatio-temporal framework. The alleged\nproponent of the antithesis arguments, on the other hand, refuses any\nconclusion that goes beyond the sensible conditions of space and time.\nAccording to the antithesis arguments, the world is infinite in both\nspace and time (these being infinite as well), and bodies are (in\naccordance with the infinite divisibility of space) also infinitely\ndivisible.\n\nIn each of these antinomial conflicts, reason finds itself at an\nimpasse. Satisfying the demands placed by our rational capacity to\nthink beyond experience, the thesis arguments offer what appears to be\na satisfying resting-place for explanation. The antithesis charges\nthat such a strategy fails to find any confirmation, and, citing the\nunjustified flight into an intelligible realm, lodges itself squarely\nin the domain of \u201cexperience.\u201d In each of these cases, the\nconflicts are resolved by demonstrating that the conclusions drawn on\nboth sides are false.\n\nHow does Kant demonstrate this? Both the thesis and antithesis\narguments are apagogic, i.e., that they constitute indirect proofs. An\nindirect proof establishes its conclusion by showing the impossibility\nof its opposite. Thus, for example, we may want to know, as in the\nfirst antinomy, whether the world is finite or infinite. We can seek\nto show that it is finite by demonstrating the impossibility of its\ninfinitude. Alternatively, we may demonstrate the infinitude of the\nworld by showing that it is impossible that it is finite. This is\nexactly what the thesis and antithesis arguments purport to do,\nrespectively. The same strategy is deployed in the second antinomy,\nwhere the proponent of the thesis position argues for the necessity of\nsome ultimately simple substance by showing the impossibility of\ninfinite divisibility of substance, etc.\n\nObviously, the success of the proofs depends on the legitimacy of the\nexclusive disjunction agreed to by both parties. Both parties, that\nis, assume that \u201cthere is a world,\u201d and that it is, for\nexample, \u201ceither finite or infinite.\u201d Herein lies the\nproblem, according to Kant. The world is, for Kant, neither finite nor\ninfinite. The opposition between these two alternatives is merely\ndialectical. In the cosmological debates, each party to the dispute\nfalls prey to the ambiguity in the idea of the world.\n\nKant thus structures his analysis of the mathematical antinomies by\nappealing to the general dialectical syllogism presented at the end of\nsection 4.0 (If the conditioned is given, the unconditioned is given,\nObjects of the senses are given as conditioned....etc.). Problems stem\nfrom the application of the principle expressed in the first premise\nto the objects of the senses (appearances). Here again, Kant diagnoses\nthe error or fallacy contained in this syllogism as that of ambiguous\nmiddle. He claims that the major premise uses the term \u201cthe\nconditioned\u201d transcendentally, as a pure concept, whereas the\nminor premise uses the term \u2018empirically\u2019 \u2013 that is\nas a \u201cconcept of the understanding applied to mere\nappearances\u201d (cf. A499\u2013500/B527\u2013528). What Kant\nmeans is that the major premise uses the term \u201cthe\nconditioned\u201d in a very general way, one that considers things in\nabstraction from the sensible conditions of our intuition. The minor\npremise, however, which specifically refers to objects in space and\ntime (appearances), is committed to an empirical use of the term.\nIndeed, such an empirical use would have to be deployed, if the\nconclusion is to be reached. The conclusion is that the entire series\nof all conditions of appearances is actually given. Put in other\nterms, the conclusion is that there is a world, understood as the sum\ntotal of all appearances and their conditions (A420/B448).\n4.2 The Dynamical Antinomies\n\nIn the dynamical antinomies, Kant changes his strategy somewhat.\nRather than arguing (as in the mathematical antinomies) that both\nconclusions are false, Kant suggests that both sides to the\ndispute might turn out to be correct. This option is available here,\nand not in the two mathematical antinomies, because the proponents of\nthe thesis arguments are not committing themselves solely to claims\nabout spatio-temporal objects. In the third antinomy, the thesis\ncontends that in addition to mechanistic causality, we must posit some\nfirst uncaused causal power (Transcendental Freedom), while the\nantithesis denies anything but mechanistic causality. Here, then, the\ndebate is the standard (though in this case, the specifically\ncosmological) dispute between freedom and determinism. Finally, in the\nfourth antinomy, the requirement for a necessary being is pitted\nagainst its opposite. The thesis position argues for a necessary\nbeing, whereas the antithesis denies that there is any such being.\n\nIn both cases the thesis opts for a position that is abstracted from\nthe spatio-temporal framework, and thus adopts the broadly Platonic\nview. The postulation of freedom amounts to the postulation of a\nnon-temporal cause, a causality outside the series of appearances in\nspace and time (A451/B479). Similarly, in its efforts to argue for a\n\u201cnecessary being,\u201d reason is forced (against its own\nargument) into a non-sensible realm. If there is a necessary being, it\nwill have to be \u201coutside\u201d the series of appearances:\n\u201cEither, therefore, reason through its demand for the\nunconditioned must remain in conflict with itself, or this\nunconditioned must be posited outside the series, in the\nintelligible\u201d (A564/B592). The rational necessity of postulating\nsuch a necessary being or a causality of freedom satisfies the\nrational demand for intelligible explanation. Against this, the\nantithesis rightly notes that the conception of transcendental\nfreedom, or a necessary being, again represents an attempt to abstract\nfrom \u201cnature\u2019s own resources\u201d\n(A451\u20132/B479\u201380). Insofar as the antithesis denies the\njustification for doing this, of course, it is said to adopt a broadly\nEpicurean standpoint. The problem here, however, is that in refusing\nto move beyond \u201cnature\u2019s own resources,\u201d the\nantithesis surreptitiously smuggles in spatio-temporal conditions as\nthe basis for a universal ontological claim that nevertheless\ntranscends all experience. If space and time were things in\nthemselves, then of course the application of the demand for this\nunconditioned would be warranted. Kant\u2019s view, however, is that\nspace and time are not conditions of things in themselves.\n\nThe resolution to these antinomies here consists in giving each side\nits due, but simultaneously limiting the domain over which the claims\nhold. The thesis demand for an absolute causal beginning or a\nnecessary being might well be allowed to stand, but certainly not as\n\u201cpart of\u201d or as an explication of appearances in nature.\nSimilarly, the antithesis conclusions can stand, but only in relation\nto objects in nature, considered as appearances. Here, the conflict\nseems irresolvable only on the assumption that appearances are things\nin themselves. If appearances were things in themselves, for example,\nthen it would certainly seem true that either they are one and all\nsubject to mechanistic causality, or not. In such a case, it makes\nsense both to argue for a non-temporal beginning and to deny such a\nbeginning. Left unresolved, then, this antinomy leaves us wit the\nfollowing dilemma: on the assumption of transcendental realism, both\nnature and freedom seem to be undermined. To avoid this, Kant appeals\nto transcendental idealism, which is supposed to rescue reason from\nthe conflict. Given transcendental idealism (with its distinction\nbetween appearances and things in themselves) it remains possible that\nin addition to the mechanism of nature, or contingent existence, there\nis an intelligible causal power, or a necessary being.\n\nDetailed discussions of Kant\u2019s antinomies can be found in Al-Azm\n(1972), Bennett, (1974), Grier (2001, 2006, forthcoming), Guyer (1987),\nHeimsoeth (1967), Strawson (1966), Thiel (2006), Watkins (1998, 2000),\nVan Cleve (1984). See also Allison (1983), and Walsh (1975). See also\nBird (2006), Wood (2010), Wuerth (2021), Willaschek (2018).\n5. God and Rational Theology\n\nThe metaphysical drive, and the demand for the unconditioned, seem to\nfind their natural resting place in the idea of God, an absolutely\nnecessary and supremely real being, the concept of which\n\u201ccontains a therefore for every wherefore\u201d (A585/B613). It\nis here, in the concept of God, that the demands for systematic unity\nand completeness of knowledge find their \u201cobjective\ncorrelate.\u201d Kant refers to this idea as an Ideal, suggesting it\ndefines itself as a \u201cconcept of an individual object which is\ncompletely determined through the mere idea\u201d (A574/B602). The\nIdeal represents the highest singular manifestation of reason\u2019s\ndemand for the unconditioned.\n\nThe last area of metaphysics under attack, then, is Rational Theology.\nKant\u2019s criticism of rational theology is complicated by his\ndesire to elucidate the sources of the dialectical errors,\nwhich he will expose in relation to the specific arguments for\nGod\u2019s existence. (\u201c\u2026Merely to describe the\nprocedure of our reason and its dialectic does not suffice; we must\nalso endeavor to discover the sources of this dialectic, that we may\nexplain\u2026the illusion to which it has given rise\u201d\n(A581/B607).) Kant thus spends a considerable amount of time tracing\nthe idea of God back to its rational, speculative, sources. According\nto Kant, \u201c\u2026.the Ideal \u2026is based on a natural, not\na merely arbitrary idea\u201d (A581/B607). On this score, Kant wants\nto tell us that we are compelled to think the idea of God (the ens\nrealissimum) when pursuing certain speculative or philosophical\ninterests. More specifically, the idea of a supremely real being (the\nens realissimum) is one to which we are inevitably led during\nour attempts to account for the pure possibility of things in general.\nThe upshot that the idea of the ens realissimum is not an\narbitrary or easily dispensable one. Instead, Kant suggests that\nreason is philosophically constrained to move to such an idea in its\nefforts to thoroughly determine every thing. Such efforts require\nthinking the totality, or \u201cAll\u201d of reality (the\nomnitudo realitatis). Such an idea is philosophically\nrequired because, in our efforts to thoroughly determine each thing\n(to know it completely, specify it exhaustively), we must be able to\nsay, of every possible predicate and its contradictory (p v\n\u02dcp) which of the two holds of the thing in question.\n(For every object, it is either A or not A, either\nB or not B, etc., and this process is iterated until\neach predicate pair (each positive reality) is exhausted \u2014 Kant\nclearly has a Leibnizian procedure of complete determination in mind\nhere.) This process is parasitic upon the idea of \u201csum total of\nall predicates of things in general.\u201d Or, put in another way, we\nrepresent \u201cevery thing as deriving its own possibility from the\nshare it has in the whole of possibility\u201d (A572/B600). Such an\nidea, the All of reality, however, defines itself as an individual\nthing, and leads us to the representation of the \u201csupremely real\nbeing.\u201d The problem seems to come in, according to Kant, when\nthe \u201cAll\u201d of reality gets hypostatized, and (eventually)\npersonified, thus yielding the ens realissimum (cf.\nA583/B611n). Here again, Kant thinks that this idea itself gets\ntransmuted into the notion of a given object by virtue of a unique\nsubreption, whereby we dialectically substitute for a principle that\nis only meant for empirical employment one which holds of things in\ngeneral. The argument Kant offers is excruciating, but the essential\npoint is that, just as the idea of the soul involved the subreption of\nthe hypostatized consciousness, so too, the idea of the ens\nrealissimum is generated by both a subrepted principle and a\nhypostatization.\n\nAs in the cases of both rational psychology and rational cosmology,\nthen, one central problem thus has to do with the assumption that pure\n(speculative) reason yields any access to a transcendent object (in\nthis case, God) about which it is entitled to seek a priori\nknowledge. Despite his insistence that the idea of God is\nindispensable and \u201cinescapable\u201d (cf. A584/B612), Kant\nagain denies that we can acquire any theoretical knowledge of the\nalleged \u201cobject\u201d thought through such an idea. On the one\nhand, then, the idea of God is \u201cthe crown of our\nendeavors.\u201d On the other, as in the cases of both rational\npsychology and cosmology, the idea answers to no given and\ntheoretically knowable object (A339/B397). Indeed, according to Kant,\nthe idea of God should not lead us to \u201cpresuppose the existence\nof a being that corresponds to this ideal, but only the idea of such a\nbeing, and this only for the purpose of deriving from an unconditioned\ntotality of complete determination the conditioned totality. i.e., the\nlimited\u2026\u201d (A578/B606). As in the other disciplines of\nmetaphysics, Kant suggests that we are motivated (perhaps even\nconstrained) to represent the idea as a real object, to hypostatize\nit, in accordance the demand for the unconditioned:\n\nNotwithstanding this pressing need of reason to presuppose something\nthat may afford the understanding a sufficient foundation for the\ncomplete determination of its concepts, it is yet too easily conscious\nof the ideal and merely fictitious character of such a presuppostion\nto allow itself, on this ground alone, to be persuaded that a mere\ncreature of its own thought is a real being \u2014 were it not that\nit is impelled from another direction to seek a resting place in the\nregress from the conditioned, which is given, to the unconditioned\n(A584/B612)\n\n\nThis demand for the unconditioned, according to Kant, links up with a\ndemand for some ultimately necessary being. Reason, that is,\nceaselessly demands the ground of all the contingent beings in\nexistence, and will not rest until it settles on the absolutely\nnecessary being which grounds them. The idea of the ens\nrealissimum plays a singular role in satisfying this desire of\nreason, for of all concepts, it is that \u201cwhich best squares with\nthe concept of an unconditionally necessary being\u201d (A586/B614).\nIn fact, according to Kant rational theology is based on the\ncoincidence of the rational demands for a supremely real being and for\na being with absolutely necessary existence. If the movement to the\nidea of God, as the unconditioned ground, is inevitable, it is\nnevertheless as troublesome as the other rational ideas:\n\nThis unconditioned is not, indeed, given as being in itself real, nor\nas having a reality that follows from its mere concept; it is,\nhowever, what alone can complete the series of conditions when we\nproceed to trace these conditions to their grounds. This is the course\nwhich our human reason, by its very nature, leads all of us\n(A584/B612; cf. A584/B612n).\n\n\nThus, although Kant is most well known for his attacks on the specific\narguments for God\u2019s existence, his criticisms of rational\ntheology are in fact more detailed, and involve a robust critique of\nthe idea of God itself. This account of the rational origin and the\nimportance of the idea of God clears the way for Kant\u2019s\nrejection of the metaphysical arguments about God\u2019s existence.\nKant identifies three traditional arguments, the ontological, the\ncosmological, and the physico-theological (the argument from design).\nWhat all such arguments do is attempt to wed the idea of the ens\nrealissimum with the notion of necessary existence. Whereas the\nOntological argument moves from the concept of the ens\nrealissimum to the claim that such a being exists\nnecessarily, the Cosmological and physico-theological arguments move\nfrom some necessary being to the conclusion that such a being\nmust be the ens realissimum.\n5.1 The Ontological Argument\n\nKant\u2019s formulation of the ontological argument is fairly\nstraightforward, and may be summarized as follows:\n\nGod, the ens realissimum, is the concept of a being that\ncontains all reality/predicates.\nExistence is a reality/predicate.\nTherefore God exists.\n\n\nKant\u2019s identification of the errors involved in this argument\nare so varied that it seems surprising that he is so often simply said\nto have argued against the use of \u201cexistence\u201d as a\npredicate. His first complaint is that it is\n\u201ccontradictory\u201d insofar as it introduces\n\u201cexistence\u201d into the \u201cconcept of a thing which we\nprofess to be thinking solely in reference to its possibility\u201d\n(A597/B625). This suggests that he thinks that in taking \u201call\nreality\u201d to mean or include \u201cexistence,\u201d the\nrational theologist begs the question, and already posits the analytic\nconnection between the concept of the ens realissimum and\nnecessary existence.\n\nAt the heart of this complaint is a more general one, to wit, that\nthere is a problem with the attempt to infer anything as\nnecessarily existing. Although, according to Kant, reason is\nunavoidably led to the notion of an absolutely necessary being, the\nunderstanding is in no position to identify any candidate answering to\nthe idea. (cf. A592/B620). Clearly, the ontological argument is\ndesigned to show that, in fact, there is one (and only one)\ncandidate answering to this idea, namely, the ens\nrealissimum. But it does so by deducing the necessary existence\nfrom the concept of the ens realissimum (a being that\ncontains all reality or predicates) only via the minor premise that\n\u201cexistence\u201d is a predicate or reality. Kant, however,\nfamously denies that existence is a \u201creal predicate,\u201d or\ndetermination. Thus, one criticism is that the argument conflates\nmerely logical with real (determining) predicates. A real\n(determining) predicate is one that enlarges the concept to which it\nis attached. It seems clear that the locus of the error here, as in\nthe other metaphysical disciplines, is the view that the idea of the\nens realissimum provides us with a concept of an\n\u201cobject\u201d to which it would be appropriate to apply\ncategories or concepts in a determining way. Thus, included in\nKant\u2019s criticism is the claim that the category of existence is\nbeing subject to a transcendental misemployment (A598/B626). This\nmisapplication of the category is problematic precisely because,\naccording to Kant, we are dealing only with an object of pure thought,\nwhose existence cannot be known (A602/B630).\n5.2 The Other Proofs\n\nIf the ontological argument seeks to move from the concept of the\nens realissimum to the concept of an absolutely necessary\nbeing, both the cosmological and physicotheological proofs move in the\nopposite direction. Each, that is, argues that there is something that\nmust exist with absolute necessity and concludes that this being is\nthe ens realissimum. Because these proofs aim to identify the\nens realissimum with the necessary being, and because the\nattempt to do this requires an a priori argument (it cannot\nbe demonstrated empirically), Kant thinks that they are both\n(ultimately) vitiated by their reliance on the ontological proof. More\nspecifically, they are both mitigated by their assumption that the\nens realissimum is the only object or candidate that can do\nthe job of existing necessarily. Since he thinks that the ontological\nargument is in some sense implicitly relied upon in making such a\nclaim, these arguments stand or fall with it. On Kant\u2019s view, as\nwe shall see, they fall.\n\nThe cosmological proof has, according to Kant, two parts. As\nabove, the proponent of the argument first seeks to demonstrate the\nexistence of an absolutely necessary being. Second, the rational\ncosmologist seeks to show that this absolutely necessary being is the\nens realissimum.\n\nAs Kant formulates it, the cosmological argument is as follows:\n\n\nIf something exists, then an absolutely necessary being must also\nexist.\n\nI myself, at least, exist.\n\nTherefore an absolutely necessary being exists.\n\n\nAs above, the theist will ultimately want to identify this necessary\nbeing with the ens realissimum, an identification which Kant\nthinks surreptitiously smuggles in the (dialectical) ontological\nargument. The claim here is that the proponent of the cosmological\nargument is committed ultimately to accepting the ontological\nargument, given her attempt to identify the necessary being with the\nens realissimum. Although this suggests that the cosmological\nargument relies on the ontological, Kant also indicates that the\neffort to produce a purely a priori argument for God\u2019s\nexistence (the ontological argument) itself gets momentum from\nreason\u2019s need to find the necessary ground for existence in\ngeneral, a need expressed in the cosmological argument (cf.\nA603\u201304/B631\u201332). This suggests that Kant takes the\nontological and cosmological arguments to be complementary expressions\nof the one underlying rational demand for the unconditioned.\n\nEven aside from its alleged commitment to the ontological argument,\nKant has a number of complaints about the cosmological argument.\nIndeed, according to Kant, the cosmological argument is characterized\nby an \u201centire nest of dialectical presumptions\u201d which must\nbe illuminated and \u201cdestroyed\u201d (A609/B637). These\ndialectical presumptions include the attempt to infer from the\ncontingent (within experience) to some cause lying outside the world\nof sense altogether, an effort involving a transcendental\nmisapplication of the categories. It also includes, Kant claims, the\ndialectical effort to infer from the conceptual impossibility\nof an infinite series of causes to some actual first cause\noutside of sense. Such efforts involve a \u201cfalse\nself-satisfaction\u201d according to which reason feels itself to\nhave finally landed on a truly necessary being. Unfortunately,\naccording to Kant, this is only achieved by conflating the merely\nlogical possibility of a concept (that it is not\nself-contradictory) with the transcendental (real)\npossibility of a thing. In short, the cosmological argument\ngets its momentum by confusing rational or subjective necessities with\nreal or objective ones, and thus involves transcendental illusion (cf.\nA605/B633).\n\nWe come finally to the physicotheological proof, which argues\nfrom the particular constitution of the world, specifically its\nbeauty, order, and purposiveness, to the necessary existence of an\nintelligent cause (God). Such an argument goes beyond the cosmological\none by moving not from existence in general but from some\ndeterminate experience in order to demonstrate the existence\nof God (A621/B649). Although this might seem to be a strength, this\nstrategy is doomed to fail, according to Kant. No experience could\never be adequate to the idea of a necessary, original being:\n\u201cThe transcendental idea of a necessary all-sufficient original\nbeing is so overwhelmingly great, so sublimely high above everything\nempirical, which is at all times conditioned, that partly one can\nnever even procure enough material in experience to fill such a\nconcept, and partly if one searches for the unconditioned among\nconditioned things, then one will seek forever and always in\nvain\u201d (A621/B649).\n\nKant\u2019s claim is that even if we could grant that the order and\npurposiveness of nature gives us good reason to suppose some\nintelligent designer, it does not warrant the inference to an ens\nrealissimum. At most, Kant tells us, the proof could establish a\n\u201chighest architect of the world\u2026., but not a creator of\nthe world.\u201d (A627/B655). The last inference, that to the ens\nrealissimum, is only drawn by moving far away from any\nconsideration of the actual (empirical) world. In other words, here\ntoo, Kant thinks that the rational theologist is relying on a\ntranscendental (a priori) argument. Indeed, according to\nKant, the physicotheological proof could never, given its empirical\nstarting point, establish the existence of a highest being by itself\nalone, and must rely on the ontological argument at crucial stages\n(cf. A625/B653). Since, according to Kant, the ontological argument\nfails, so does the physicotheological one.\n\nAlthough Kant rejects the physiciotheological argument as a\ntheoretical proof for God\u2019s existence, he also sees in it a\npowerful expression of reason\u2019s need to recognize in nature\npurposive unity and design (cf. A625/B651). In this, the\nphysicotheological argument\u2019s emphasis on the purposiveness and\nsystematic unity of nature illuminates an assumption that Kant takes\nto be essential to our endeavors in the natural sciences. The\nessential role played by the assumption of purposive and systematic\nunity, and the role it plays in scientific inquiries, is taken up by\nKant in the Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic. To this topic we\nnow turn.\n\nFor some discussions of the Ideal of Pure Reason and Rational\nTheology, see Caimi (1995). England (1968), Grier (2001, forthcoming),\nHenrich (1960), Longuenesse (1995, 2005), Rohs (1978), Walsh (1975),\nand Wood (1978), Chignell (2009), Grier (2010), Chignell (2014), Wuerth\n(2021), Willaschek (2018)\n6. Reason and the Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic\n\nThe criticisms of the metaphysical arguments offered in the\nTranscendental Dialectic do not bring Kant\u2019s discussion to a\nclose. Indeed, in an \u201cAppendix\u201d to the Transcendental\nDialectic, Kant returns to the issue of reason\u2019s positive or\nnecessary role. The curious \u201cAppendix\u201d has provoked a\ngreat deal of confusion, and not without reason. After all, the entire\nthrust of the Dialectic seemed to be directed at\n\u201ccritiquing\u201d and curbing pure reason, and undermining its\npretense to any real use. Nevertheless, Kant goes on to suggest that\nthe very reason that led us into metaphysical error is also the source\nof certain necessary ideas and principles, and moreover, that these\nrational postulations play an essential role in scientific theorizing\n(A645/B673; A671/B699). Exactly what role they are supposed to play in\nthis regard is less clear.\n\nThe Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic is divided into two\nparts. In the first, \u201cOn the Regulative Use of the Ideas of Pure\nReason,\u201d Kant attempts to identify some proper\n\u201cimmanent\u201d use for reason. In its most general terms, Kant\nis here concerned to establish a necessary role for reason\u2019s\nprinciple of systematic unity. This principle was first formulated by\nKant in the Introduction to the Transcendental Dialectic in two forms,\none prescriptive, and the other in what sounded to be a metaphysical\nclaim. In the first, prescriptive form, the principle enjoins us to\n\u201cFind for the conditioned knowledge given through the\nunderstanding the unconditioned whereby its unity is brought to\ncompletion.\u201d The complementary metaphysical principle assures us\nthat the \u201cunconditioned\u201d is indeed given and there to be\nfound. Taken together, these principles express reason\u2019s\ninterests in securing systematic unity of knowledge and bringing such\nknowledge to completion.\n\nKant is quite clear that he takes reason\u2019s demand for\nsystematicity to play an important role in empirical inquiry. In\nconnection with this, Kant suggests that the coherent operation of the\nunderstanding somehow requires reason\u2019s guiding influence,\nparticularly if we are to unify the knowledge given through the real\nuse of the understanding into scientific theory (cf.\nA651\u201352/B679\u201380). To order knowledge systematically, for\nKant, means to subsume or unify it under fewer and fewer principles in\nlight of the idea of one \u201cwhole of knowledge\u201d so that its\nparts are exhibited in their necessary connections (cf. 646/B674). The\nidea of the form of a whole of knowledge is thus said to postulate\n\u201ccomplete unity in the knowledge obtained by the understanding,\nby which this knowledge is to be not a mere contingent aggregate, but\na system connected according to necessary laws\u201d (A646/B676).\nHaving said this, it should be noted that Kant\u2019s position is, in\nits details, difficult to pin down. Sometimes Kant suggests merely\nthat we ought to seek systematic unity of knowledge, and this\nmerely for own theoretical convenience (A771/B799-A772/B800). Other\ntimes, however, he suggests that we must assume that the nature\nitself conforms to our demands for systematic unity, and this\nnecessarily, if we are to secure even an empirical criterion of truth\n(cf. A651\u201353/B679\u201381). The precise status of the demand\nfor systematicity is therefore somewhat controversial.\n\nRegardless of these more subtle textual issues Kant remains committed\nto the view that reason\u2019s proper use is always only\n\u201cregulative\u201d and never constitutive. The distinction\nbetween the regulative and the constitutive may be viewed as\ndescribing two different ways in which the claims of reason may be\ninterpreted. A principle of reason is constitutive, according to Kant,\nwhen it is taken to supply a concept of a real object (A306/B363;\nA648/B676). Throughout the Dialectic Kant argued against this\n(constitutive) interpretation of the ideas and principles of reason,\nclaiming that reason so far transcends possible experience that there\nis nothing in experience that corresponds with its ideas. Although\nKant denies that reason is constitutive he nevertheless, as we have\nseen, insists that it has an \u201cindispensably necessary\u201d\nregulative use. In accordance with reason\u2019s demand, the\nunderstanding is guided and led to secure systematic unity and\ncompletion of knowledge. In other words, Kant seeks to show that\nreason\u2019s demand for systematic unity is related to the project\nof empirical knowledge acquisition. Indeed, Kant links the demand for\nsystematicity up with three other principles \u2014 those of\nhomogeneity, specification and affinity \u2014 which he thinks\nexpress the fundamental presumptions that guide us in theory\nformation. The essential point seems to be that the development and\nexpansion of empirical knowledge is always, as it were,\n\u201calready\u201d guided by the rational interests in securing\nunity and completion of knowledge. Without such a guiding agenda, and\nwithout the assumption that nature conforms to our rational demands\nfor securing unity and coherence of knowledge, our scientific pursuits\nwould lack orientation. Thus, the claim that reason\u2019s principles\nplay a necessary \u201cregulative\u201d role in science reflects\nKant\u2019s critical reinterpretation of the traditional rationalist\nideal of arriving at complete knowledge.\n\nIt is connection with this that Kant argues, in the second part of the\nAppendix (\u201cOn the Final Aim of the Natural Dialectic of Human\nReason\u201d (A669/B697)), that the three highest ideas of reason\nhave an important theoretical function. More specifically, in\nthis section Kant turns from a general discussion of the important\n(regulative) use of the principle of systematicity, to a consideration\nof the three transcendental ideas (the Soul, the World, and God) at\nissue in the Dialectic. As examples of the unifying and guiding role\nof reason\u2019s ideas, Kant had earlier appealed to the ideas of\n\u201cpure earth\u201d and \u201cpure air\u201d in Chemistry, or\nthe idea of a \u201cfundamental power\u201d in psychological\ninvestigations (cf. A650/B678). His suggestion earlier was that these\nideas are implicit in the practices governing scientific\nclassification, and enjoin us to seek explanatory connections between\ndisparate phenomena. As such, reason\u2019s postulations serve to\nprovide an orienting point towards which our explanations strive, and\nin accordance with which our theories progressively achieve systematic\ninterconnection and unity. Similarly, Kant now suggests that each of\nthe three transcendental ideas of reason at issue in the Dialectic\nserves as an imaginary point (focus imaginarius) towards\nwhich our investigations hypothetically converge. More specifically,\nhe suggests that the idea of the soul serves to guide our empirical\ninvestigations in psychology, the idea of the world grounds physics,\nand the idea of God grounds the unification of these two branches of\nnatural science into one unified Science (cf. A684/B712-A686/B714). In\neach of these cases, Kant claims, the idea allows us to represent\n(problematically) the systematic unity towards which we aspire and\nwhich we presuppose in empirical studies. In accordance with the idea\nof God, for example, we \u201cconsider every connection in the world\naccording to principles [Principien] of a systematic unity,\nhence as if they had all arisen from one single\nall-encompassing being, as supreme and all-sufficient cause\u201d\n(A686/B714). Such a claim, controversial as it is, illuminates\nKant\u2019s view that empirical inquiries are one and all undertaken\nin light of the rational goal of a single unified body of knowledge.\nIt also points towards the Kantian view, later emphasized in the\nTranscendental Doctrine of Method, that reason\u2019s theoretical and\npractical interests ultimately form a higher unity.\n\nFor discussions on the Appendix and the role of reason and\nsystematicity, see Allison (2004), Brandt (1989), Buchdahl (1967),\nBritton (1978), Forster (2000), Friedman (1992), Ginsborg (1990),\nGrier (2001, forthcoming), Guyer (1990a, 1990b), Horstmann (1989),\nO\u2019Neill (1992), Patricia Kitcher (1991), Philip Kitcher (1984),\nNieman (1994), MacFarland (1970), Walker (1990), Walsh (1975),\nWartenberg (1979, 1992), Rauscher (2010), Willaschek (2018).\n\nFor an important discussion on the \u201cunity\u201d of theoretical\nand practical reason, see again Forster (2000).
