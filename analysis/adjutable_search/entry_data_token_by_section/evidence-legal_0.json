    "main_text": "Conceptions of Evidence: What does Evidence Refer to in Law?\n1. Conceptions of Evidence: What does Evidence Refer to in Law?\n\nStephen (1872: 3\u20134, 6\u20137) long ago noted that legal usage\nof the term \u201cevidence\u201d is ambiguous. It sometimes refers\nto that which is adduced by a party at the trial as a means of\nestablishing factual claims. (\u201cAdducing evidence\u201d is the\nlegal term for presenting or producing evidence in court for the\npurpose of establishing proof.) This meaning of evidence is reflected\nin the definitional section of the Indian Evidence Act (Stephen 1872:\n 149).[3]\n When lawyers use the term \u201cevidence\u201d in this way, they\nhave in mind what epistemologists would think of as \u201cobjects of\nsensory evidence\u201d (Haack 2004: 48). Evidence, in this sense, is\ndivided conventionally into three main\n categories:[4]\n oral evidence (the testimony given in court by witnesses),\ndocumentary evidence (documents produced for inspection by the court),\nand \u201creal evidence\u201d; the first two are self-explanatory\nand the third captures things other than documents such as a knife\nallegedly used in committing a crime.\n\nThe term \u201cevidence\u201d can, secondly, refer to a proposition\nof fact that is established by evidence in the first\n sense.[5]\n This is sometimes called an \u201cevidential fact\u201d. That the\naccused was at or about the scene of the crime at the relevant time is\nevidence in the second sense of his possible involvement in the crime.\nBut the accused\u2019s presence must be proved by producing evidence\nin the first sense. For instance, the prosecution may call a witness\nto appear before the court and get him to testify that he saw the\naccused in the vicinity of the crime at the relevant time. Success in\nproving the presence of the accused (the evidential fact) will depend\non the fact-finder\u2019s assessment of the veracity of the witness\nand the reliability of his testimony. (The fact-finder is the person\nor body responsible for ascertaining where the truth lies on disputed\nquestions of fact and in whom the power to decide on the verdict\nvests. The fact-finder is also called \u201ctrier of fact\u201d or\n\u201cjudge of fact\u201d. Fact-finding is the task of the jury or,\nfor certain types of cases and in countries without a jury system, the\njudge.) Sometimes the evidential fact is directly accessible to the\nfact-finder. If the alleged knife used in committing the crime in\nquestion (a form of \u201creal evidence\u201d) is produced in court,\nthe fact-finder can see for himself the shape of the knife; he does\nnot need to learn of it through the testimony of an intermediary.\n\nA third conception of evidence is an elaboration or extension of the\nsecond. On this conception, evidence is relational. A factual\nproposition (in Latin, factum probans) is evidence in the\nthird sense only if it can serve as a premise for drawing an inference\n(directly or indirectly) to a matter that is material to the case\n(factum probandum) (see\n section 2.2\n below for the concept of materiality). The fact that the\naccused\u2019s fingerprints were found in a room where something was\nstolen is evidence in the present sense because one can infer from\nthis that he was in the room, and his presence in the room is evidence\nof his possible involvement in the theft. On the other hand, the fact\nthat the accused\u2019s favorite color is blue would, in the absence\nof highly unusual circumstances, be rejected as evidence of his guilt:\nordinarily, what a person\u2019s favorite color happens to be cannot\nserve as a premise for any reasonable inference towards his commission\nof a crime and, as such, it is irrelevant (see discussion of relevance\nin\n section 2.1\n below). In the third sense of \u201cevidence\u201d, which conceives\nof evidence as a premise for a material inference, \u201cirrelevant\nevidence\u201d is an oxymoron: it is simply not evidence. Hence, this\nstatement of Bentham (1825:\n 230):[6]\n\n\nTo say that testimony is not pertinent, is to say that it is foreign\nto the case, has no connection with it, and does not serve to prove\nthe fact in question; in a word, it is to say, that it is not\nevidence.\n\n\nThere can be evidence in the first sense without evidence in the\nsecond or third sense. To pursue our illustration, suppose it emerges\nduring cross-examination of the expert that his testimony of having\nfound a finger-print match was a lie. Lawyers would describe this\nsituation as one where the \u201cevidence\u201d (the testimony of\nthe expert) fails to prove the fact that it was originally produced to\nprove and not that no \u201cevidence\u201d was adduced on the\nmatter. Here \u201cevidence\u201d is used in the first\nsense\u2014evidence as testimony\u2014and the testimony remains in\nthe court\u2019s record whether it is believed or not. But lawyers\nwould also say that, in the circumstances, there is no\n\u201cevidence\u201d that the accused was in the room, assuming that\nthere was nothing apart from the discredited expert testimony of a\nfingerprint match to establish his presence there. Here, the\nexpert\u2019s testimony is shown to be false and fails to establish\nthat the accused\u2019s fingerprints were found in the room, and\nthere is no (other) factual basis for believing that he was in the\nroom. The factual premise from which an inference is sought to be\ndrawn towards the accused\u2019s guilt is not established.\n\nFourthly, the conditions for something to be received (or, in\ntechnical term \u201cadmitted\u201d) as evidence at the trial are\nsometimes included in the legal concept of evidence. (These conditions\nare discussed in\n section 2\n below.) On this conception, legal evidence is that which counts as\nevidence in law. Something may ordinarily be treated as evidence and\nyet be rejected by the court. Hearsay is often cited as an example. It\nis pointed out that reliance on hearsay is a commonplace in ordinary\nlife. We frequently rely on hearsay in forming our factual beliefs. In\ncontrast, \u201chearsay is not evidence\u201d in legal proceedings\n(Stephen 1872: 4\u20135). As a general rule, the court will not rely\non hearsay as a premise for an inference towards the truth of what is\nasserted. It will not allow a witness to testify in court that another\nperson X (who is not brought before the court) said that\np on a certain occasion (an out-of-court statement) for the\npurpose of proving that p.\n\nIn summary, at least four possible conceptions of legal evidence are\nin currency: as an object of sensory evidence, as a proposition of\nfact, as an inferential premise and as that which counts as evidence\nin law. The sense in which the term \u201cevidence\u201d is being\nused is seldom made explicit in legal discourse although the intended\nmeaning will often be clear from the context.\n",
