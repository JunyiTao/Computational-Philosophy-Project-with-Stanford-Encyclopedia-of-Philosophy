    "main_text": "General Orientation || NE: A brief note on the pre-Quinean history\n1.3 NE: A brief note on the pre-Quinean history\n\nWhile Cartesian epistemology offers an especially vivid instance of\nall of the features of TE discussed above, some of those same\ntendencies and concerns are, of course, present in varying degrees in\nthe work of other figures in the epistemological canon. The assumption\nthat epistemology trades in normative matters, and not just\ndescription\n (c),\n and an abiding concern with skepticism\n (d),\n for example, can be seen in much epistemology from Descartes through\nto the present.\n\nAt the same time, however, many of the same figures\u2019 works\ncomfortably assume features of the naturalistic outlook. So naturalism\nis far from a recent invention; as Kornblith puts it, it has \u201ca\nlong and distinguished heritage\u201d (1999: 158). As the subtitle of\nHume\u2019s most famous work, for example, makes\nclear\u2014\u201cAn attempt to introduce the experimental method of\nreasoning into moral [i.e., human] subjects\u201d\u2014his intention\nwas to apply the Newtonian \u201cexperimental method\u201d to the\nhuman mind, avoiding \u201chypotheses\u201d and trying to uncover\nthe most general underlying principles. Only then, he thought, would\nwe be in a position to get our epistemic position into proper\nperspective. Further, the inspiration Hume draws from sciences beyond\n\u201cthe science of man\u201d (1739, \u201cIntroduction\u201d) to\nwhich he intends his own work to be a contribution, is not merely\nmethodological. He compares his principles of association to gravity,\nfor example, \u201cideas and impressions\u201d being the relevant\ndomain of \u201cobjects\u201d on which those \u201cforces\u201d\noperate (ibid., 1.1.4 para 6). Lastly, according to Barry\nStroud, Hume\u2019s \u201crevolution in philosophy\u201d was his\nuse of this empirical orientation to rein in and replace an overly\nrationalistic conception of cognitive agents:\n\n\nThere had traditionally been a largely inherited or a priori framework\nof thinking about human nature\u2014in particular about man\u2019s\nrationality\u2014that Hume seeks both to discredit and to supplant.\n(Stroud 1977: 9)\n\n\nOn the face of it, the \u201cskeptical\u201d upshot of Hume\u2019s\nstudy stands in stark contrast to the strong sense of enlightenment\noptimism with which the Treatise begins (compare the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d of the Treatise to Book I\u2019s\n\u201cConclusion\u201d). But Locke, for example, is more\nconsistently optimistic. His discussion of the nature and extent of\nhuman knowledge is, like Hume\u2019s, preceded and informed by\npsychological theorizing based\u2014to the best of his\nability\u2014on good observational reasoning. Further, Locke insists\nthat it is \u201c[f]olly to expect demonstration in everything\u201d\n(Locke 1690: IV.XI.10), and he defends the information of the senses\nas giving us \u201can assurance that deserves the name\nknowledge\u201d (ibid., IV.XI.3), notwithstanding the\ntheoretical possibility of our being deceived. This runs counter to\nDescartes\u2019 infallibilism, of course. But it also illustrates the\nabove-mentioned shift, characteristic of NE, away from perfectly\ngeneral questions about the nature and possibility of knowledge to\nunderstanding human knowledge, given the facts of our powers and\nsituation:\n\n\n\u2026our faculties being suited not to the full extent of Being,\nnor to a perfect, clear, comprehensive Knowledge of things free from\nall doubt and scruple; but to the preservation of us, in whom they\nare; and accommodated to the use of Life: they serve to our purpose\nwell enough, if they will but give us certain notice of those Things,\nwhich are convenient or inconvenient to us\u2026. (1690:\nIV.XI.8)\n\n\nSimilar themes, both methodological and epistemic, are at the\nforefront in Thomas Reid, who begins his first major work as\nfollows:\n\n\nWise men now agree, or ought to agree, in this, that there is but one\nway to the knowledge of nature\u2019s works\u2014the way of\nobservation and experiment\u2026.All that we know of the body, is\nowing to anatomical dissection and observation, and it must be by an\nanatomy of the mind that we can discover its powers and\nprinciples\u2026. (1764: Chapter 1, Section 1)\n\n\nAs to his epistemology, Norman Daniels claims that Reid\u2019s views\ncan be seen as \u201ca precursor to recent work in cognitive\npsychology and \u2018naturalized epistemology\u2019\u201d (1989:\n133). And Rysiew (2002) argues that Reid does not entirely separate\npsychological facts from epistemic norms.\n\nIn general, then, if by \u201cpsychologism\u201d we mean simply the\nview that psychology is of direct relevance to certain areas of\nphilosophy\u2014as opposed to its (usually pejorative) usage in\ndenoting the identification of psychological and normative or\nlogical matters\u2014there is ample backing for Goldman\u2019s claim\nthat \u201c[p]sychologistic epistemology\u2026is in the mainstream\nof historical epistemology\u201d (1986:\n 6).[6]\n It was Frege (in The Foundations of Arithmetic, 1884), and\nHusserl (in his \u201cProlegomena to Pure Logic\u201d, in the\nLogical Investigations, 1900), with their trenchant critiques\nof psychologism in logic and mathematics, who were largely responsible\nfor initiating the sharp turn away from this broadly naturalistic\nstatus quo (see Kusch 2014; see too Kitcher 1992, Goldman\n1986, Kelly 2014, Anderson 2005, and Engel 1998). A key part of\nFrege\u2019s and Husserl\u2019s thinking here was that tying logic\nto psychology was incompatible with preserving its necessary\ncharacter, and with its being knowable a priori. Following\ntheir lead, the logical positivists approached epistemology, as other\nareas, as a matter of a priori \u201crational\nreconstruction\u201d, in Carnap\u2019s (1928 [1967]) famous phrase.\nSuch reconstruction \u201creplace[d] rationally opaque processes with\ntransparently rational definitions and inferences\u201d (Richardson\n2006: 682). Claims about ordinary objects were given \u201clogical\ndefinitions\u201d in a language that made reference only to\nexperience (sense data); more complex such statements were defined in\nterms of simpler ones, and logical relations between them were made\nexplicit. In none of this was the goal to be faithful to actual\npsychology.\n\nThe clean separation of psychology from epistemology was enshrined as\nwell in Reichenbach\u2019s famous distinction between the context of\ndiscovery and the context of justification, which he described as\n\u201ca more convenient determination\u201d of rational\nreconstruction (Reichenbach 1938: 6; cf. Richardson 2006: 683).\nReichenbach writes:\n\n\nEpistemology does not regard the processes of thinking in their actual\noccurrence; this task is entirely left to psychology. What\nepistemology intends is to construct thinking processes in a way in\nwhich they ought to occur if they are to be ranged in a consistent\nsystem; or to construct justifiable sets of operations which can be\nintercalated between the starting-point and the issue of\nthought-processes, replacing the real intermediate links. Epistemology\nthus considers a logical substitute rather than real processes.\n(Reichenbach 1938: 5)\n\n\nWhile enthusiasm for the project of rational reconstruction faded,\nelements of the program\u2014a disinterest in psychology, a\npreference for a formal-logical approach, and a concern with precise\ndefinition of key terms\u2014were retained. It was in this period\nthat \u201cconceptual analysis\u201d, for example, came to\nprominence.\n\n\nThe paradigms of epistemology became the logic of confirmation, the\nanalysis of \u201cS knows that p\u201d, and the theory\nof justification or warrant, (Goldman 1986: 7) \n\n\nto none of which was psychology, much less any other empirical\nscience, thought to be relevant.\n",
