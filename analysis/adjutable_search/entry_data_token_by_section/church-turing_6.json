    "main_text": "The 1936 Thesis and its Context || Comparing the Turing and Church approaches\n1.6 Comparing the Turing and Church approaches\n\nOne way in which Turing\u2019s and Church\u2019s approaches differed\nwas that Turing\u2019s concerns were rather more general than\nChurch\u2019s, in that (as just mentioned) Church considered only\nfunctions of positive integers, whereas Turing described his work as\nencompassing \u201ccomputable functions of an integral variable or a\nreal or computable variable, computable predicates, and so\nforth\u201d (1936 [2004: 58]). Turing intended to pursue the theory\nof computable functions of a real variable in a subsequent paper, but\nin fact did not do so.\n\nA greater difference lay in the profound significance of\nTuring\u2019s approach for the emerging science of automatic\ncomputation. Church\u2019s approach did not mention computing\nmachinery, whereas Turing\u2019s introduced the \u201cTuring\nmachine\u201d (as Church dubbed it in his 1937a review of\nTuring\u2019s 1936 paper). Turing\u2019s paper also introduced what\nhe called the \u201cuniversal computing machine\u201d. Now known as\nthe universal Turing machine, this is Turing\u2019s all-purpose\ncomputing machine. The universal machine is able to emulate the\nbehavior of any single-purpose Turing machine, i.e., any Turing\nmachine set up to solve one particular problem. The universal machine\ndoes this by means of storing a description of the other machine on\nits tape, in the form of a finite list of instructions (a computer\nprogram, in modern terms). By following suitable instructions, the\nuniversal machine can carry out any and every effective procedure,\nassuming Turing\u2019s thesis is true. The functional parts of the\nabstract universal machine are:\n\nthe memory in which instructions and data are stored, and\nthe instruction-reading-and-obeying control mechanism.\n\n\nIn that respect, the universal Turing machine is a bare-bones logical\nmodel of almost every modern electronic digital computer.\n\nIn his review of Turing\u2019s work, Church noted an advantage of\nTuring\u2019s analysis of effectiveness over his own:\n\n\ncomputability by a Turing machine \u2026 has the advantage of making\nthe identification with effectiveness in the ordinary (not explicitly\ndefined) sense evident immediately. (Church 1937a: 43)\n\n\nHe also said that Turing\u2019s analysis has \u201ca more immediate\nintuitive appeal\u201d than his own (Church 1941: 41).\n\nG\u00f6del found Turing\u2019s analysis superior to Church\u2019s.\nKleene related that G\u00f6del was unpersuaded by Church\u2019s\nthesis until he saw Turing\u2019s formulation:\n\n\nAccording to a November 29, 1935, letter from Church to me, G\u00f6del\n\u201cregarded as thoroughly unsatisfactory\u201d Church\u2019s\nproposal to use \u03bb-definability as a definition of effective\ncalculability. \u2026 It seems that only after Turing\u2019s\nformulation appeared did G\u00f6del accept Church\u2019s thesis.\n(Kleene 1981: 59, 61)\n\n\nG\u00f6del described Turing\u2019s analysis of computability as\n\u201cmost satisfactory\u201d and \u201ccorrect \u2026 beyond any\ndoubt\u201d (G\u00f6del 1951: 304 and 193?: 168). He remarked:\n\n\nWe had not perceived the sharp concept of mechanical procedures\nsharply before Turing, who brought us to the right perspective.\n(Quoted in Wang 1974: 85)\n\n\nG\u00f6del also said:\n\n\nThe resulting definition of the concept of mechanical by the sharp\nconcept of \u201cperformable by a Turing machine\u201d is both\ncorrect and unique. (Quoted in Wang 1996: 203)\n\n\nAnd:\n\n\nMoreover it is absolutely impossible that anybody who understands the\nquestion and knows Turing\u2019s definition should decide for a\ndifferent concept. (Ibid.)\n\n\nEven the modest young Turing agreed that his analysis was\n\u201cpossibly more convincing\u201d than Church\u2019s (Turing\n1937: 153).\n",
