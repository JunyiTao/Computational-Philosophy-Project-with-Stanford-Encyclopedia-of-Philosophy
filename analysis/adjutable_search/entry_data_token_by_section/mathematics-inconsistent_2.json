    "main_text": "Analysis\n3. Analysis\n\nOne could hardly ignore the examples of analysis and its special case,\nthe calculus. For a model-theoretic approach to these see Mortensen\n(1990, 1995).\n\nNow Meyer\u2019s original approach to the natural numbers, that is\nR#, was axiomatic rather than model-theoretic. The axiomatic approach\nhas also been taken in analysis by McKubre-Jordens and Weber\n(2012). In axiomatising analysis with a base of paraconsistent logic,\ntheir paper pushes Meyer\u2019s approach to arithmetic via R# a long\nway further. These same authors (2017) rework the theory of\nintegration as it was in Archimedes\u2019 hands, which employs the\nmethod of exhaustion, using paraconsistent reasoning. This gives a\nresult \u201cup to inconsistency\u201d, which means that one is able\nto prove \u201cClassical result or contradiction\u201d. The\nclassical result can be then seen to be recapturable by the classical\nmove disjunctive syllogism applied to the classically-false\n(inconsistent) second disjunct.\n\nIt is certainly important and worthy to pursue this direction, but a\nmild caution is entered here: the axiomatic project is a bit different\nfrom inconsistent mathematics. As noted earlier, Meyer in this phase\nwas consistentist \u2013 he sought a consistent theory with an\ninconsistency-tolerant logic. With similar motivation, he was also\nconcerned to try to settle what he called \u201cthe gamma\nproblem\u201d, which was essentially the question of whether the\naxiomatic theory R# could be shown to contain classical Peano\narithmetic as a sub-theory. If this were so, then his proof of\nnontriviality for R# would immediately yield a new proof of the\nnegation consistency of classical Peano arithmetic! Note that this\nwould not be contrary to Godel\u2019s Second Theorem, since\npresumably the proof of the gamma result would not be confined to\nfinitary techniques. (In the case of Meyer\u2019s theory, it turned\nout to be not so.)\n\nThere have proved to be many places throughout analysis where there\nare distinctive inconsistent insights. The examples in the remainder\nof this section are drawn from Mortensen (1995). For example: (1)\nRobinson\u2019s (1974) non-standard analysis was based on\ninfinitesimals, quantities smaller than any real number, as well as\ntheir reciprocals, the infinite numbers. This has an inconsistent\nversion, which has some advantages for calculation in being able to\ndiscard higher-order infinitesimals. Interestingly, the theory of\ndifferentiation turned out to have these advantages, while the theory\nof integration did not. A similar result, using a different background\nlogic, was obtained by Da Costa (2000). (2) Another place to find\napplications of inconsistency in analysis is topology, where one\nreadily observes the practice of cutting and pasting spaces being\ndescribed as \u201cidentification\u201d of one boundary with\nanother. One can show that this can be described in an inconsistent\ntheory in which the two boundaries are both identical and not\nidentical, and it can be further argued that this is the most natural\ndescription of the practice. (3) Yet another application is the class\nof inconsistent continuous functions. Not all functions which are\nclassically discontinuous are amenable of inconsistent treatment; but\nsome are, for example f(x)=0 for all x<0\nand f(x)=1 for all x\u22650. The inconsistent\nextension replaces the first < by \u2264, and has distinctive\nstructural properties. These inconsistent functions may well have some\napplication in dynamic systems in which there are discontinuous jumps,\nsuch as quantum measurement systems. Differentiating such functions\nleads to the delta functions, applied by Dirac to the study of quantum\nmeasurement. (4) Next, there is the well-known case of inconsistent\nsystems of linear equations, such as the system (i)\nx+y=1, plus (ii) x+y=2. Such\nsystems can potentially arise within the context of automated control.\nLittle work has been done classically to solve such systems, but it\ncan be shown that there are well-behaved solutions within inconsistent\nvector spaces. (5) Finally, one can note a further application in\ntopology and dynamics. Given a supposition which seems to be\nconceivable, namely that whatever happens or is true, happens or is\ntrue on an open set of (spacetime) points, one has that the logic of\ndynamically possible paths is open set logic, that is to say\nintuitionist logic, which supports incomplete theories par excellence.\nThis is because the natural account of the negation of a proposition\nin such a space says that it holds on the largest open set contained\nin the Boolean complement of the set of points on which the original\nproposition held, which is in general smaller than the Boolean\ncomplement. However, specifying a topological space by its closed sets\nis every bit as reasonable as specifying it by its open sets. Yet the\nlogic of closed sets is known to be paraconsistent, ie. supports\ninconsistent nontrivial theories; see Goodman (1981), for example.\nThus given the (alternative) supposition which also seems to be\nconceivable, namely that whatever is true is true on a closed set of\npoints, one has that inconsistent theories may well hold. This is\nbecause the natural account of the negation of a proposition, namely\nthat it holds on the smallest closed set containing the Boolean\nnegation of the proposition, means that on the overlapping boundary\nboth the proposition and its negation hold. Thus dynamical theories\ndetermine their own logic of possible propositions, and corresponding\ntheories which may be inconsistent, and are certainly as natural as\ntheir incomplete counterparts.\n\nOn closed set logic and boundaries as a natural setting for\ncontradictory theories, see Mortensen (2003, 2010). Weber and Cotnoir\n(2015) also explore the inconsistency of boundaries, arising from the\nincompatibility of the three principles (i) there are boundaries, (ii)\nspace is topologically connected, and (iii) discrete entities can be\nin contact (i.e., no space between them). This is a very interesting\nproblem, as all three are plausible; in particular there do seem to be\nboundaries in our world. An initially surprising feature of this\naccount is that boundaries come out as \u201cempty\u201d; after all,\nnull entities are contrary to the spirit of mereology. But this is not\nso shocking as it turns out that they are only empty in the sense that\nthey have members inconsistently.\n\nCategory theory throws light on many mathematical structures. It has\ncertainly been proposed as an alternative foundation for mathematics.\nSuch generality inevitably runs into problems similar to those of\ncomprehension in set theory; see, e.g., Hatcher 1982 (pp.\n255\u2013260). Hence there is the same possible application of\ninconsistent solutions. There is also an important collection of\ncategorial structures, the toposes, which support open set logic in\nexact parallel to the way sets support Boolean logic. This has been\ntaken by many to be a vindication of the foundational point of view of\nmathematical intuitionism. However, it can be proved that that toposes\nsupport closed set logic as readily as they support open set logic, to\ndate the only category-theoretic semantics for a paraconsistent logic.\nThis should not be viewed as an objection to intuitionism, however, so\nmuch as an argument that inconsistent theories are equally reasonable\nas items of mathematical study. See Mortensen (1995 Chap 11, co-author\nLavers). This position has now been taken up, extended and ably\ndefended by Estrada-Gonz\u00e1lez (2010, 2015a, 2015b). The same author\n(2016) undertakes to provide a category-theoretic description of\ntrivial theories, with the aim of showing that triviality is not such\nan uninteresting feature for mathematical theories to have. The\npresent author remains unconvinced, since a trivial theory is surely\nuseless for mathematical calculation; but the ingenuity of the\narguments must be conceded.\n\nDuality between incompleteness/intuitionism and\ninconsistency/paraconsistency has at least two aspects. First there is\nthe above topological (open/closed) duality. Second there is Routley *\nduality. The Routley Star * of a set of sentences S, is\ndefined as S* =df {A:\n~A is not in S}. Discovered by the Routleys (1972)\nas a semantical tool for relevant logics, the * operation dualises\nbetween inconsistent and incomplete theories of the large natural\nclass of de Morgan logics. For example, starring Peano arithmetic\ngives a deductively-closed inconsistent complete non-trivial classical\narithmetical theory containing all of PA, which presents an\ninteresting challenge for the Godel incompleteness results, see\nMortensen (2013). Both kinds of duality interact as well, where the *\ngives distinctive duality and invariance theorems for open set and\nclosed set arithmetical theories. On the basis of these results, it is\nfair to argue that both kinds of mathematics, intuitionist and\nparaconsistent, are equally reasonable.\n",
