Abstract mass nouns\n\n\n\u201cAbstract\u201d nouns like sadness and\nwisdom and \u201cconcrete\u201d nouns like water\nand furniture all belong to the morphosyntactic class of mass\nnouns. However, semantics for mass nouns have generally focused on\nconcrete terms, i.e., terms that apply to concrete entities. This raises\nan important question: are abstract mass nouns a separate species of\nmass nouns, with their own semantic properties? Or can a general\naccount be proposed, which would work both for concrete mass nouns and\nabstract ones?\n\n\nNicolas (2004, 2010) shows that a general account of the semantics\nof mass nouns can indeed be proposed, provided one takes a more general\nstance than when focusing on concrete mass nouns alone (see also Grimm 2014). Several issues\narise.\n\n\nReference: concrete common nouns can be used in definite\ndescriptions, where they seem to refer to entities of various types. Do\nabstract mass nouns refer to something when they are used in definite\ndescriptions? And if so, what do they refer to? Consider sentences like\nthese: Julie\u2019s wisdom attracted Tom. Julie\u2019s love for Tom lasted\nseveral years. Nicolas proposes that their subjects, which are\nheaded by abstract mass nouns, do refer (or make as if to refer) to\ninstances of properties or relations, thereby introducing these as\nreferents in the\n discourse (Moltmann 2007 proposes something similar).\nHe argues that this provides the most unified explanation of the\nvarious uses of abstract mass nouns.\n\n\nNominalization: many abstract mass nouns are derived from an\nadjective or verb. What is the semantic effect of nominalization?\nNicolas proposes that its intuitive effect, namely reification, a\n\u201csomething-from-nothing transformation\u201d, is adequately captured by\nmeaning postulates. Thus, a meaning postulate relates the meanings of\nthe mass noun love and the verb to love. It ensures\nthat an instance of love from John towards Mary exists if and only if\nJohn loves Mary.\n\n\nDistributive, collective, and intermediate construals: sentences\nwith concrete mass nouns or plurals may receive so-called distributive,\ncollective, and intermediate construals (cf. section 8 above). Is it\nalso the case with abstract mass nouns? Nicolas (2010) suggests that\nthis is so. Take the sentence The strength of these men is\nimpressive, uttered in a context where two strong teams are\ncompeting. The sentence can assert that the strength of each team is\nimpressive. This corresponds to a construal which is neither\ndistributive (the strength of each man is impressive), nor collective\n(the strength of the men all together is impressive), but intermediate\nbetween distributive and collective. Nicolas shows that these\nconstruals can be accounted for by Gillon\u2019s (1996) rule for the\ninterpretation of complex noun phrases containing a prepositional\nphrase.\n\n\nOverall, then, it seems that a unified semantics can be specified\nfor all mass nouns.\n",
