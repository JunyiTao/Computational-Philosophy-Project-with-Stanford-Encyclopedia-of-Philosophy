    "main_text": "Constituent Versus Nonconstituent Ontology || God and His Nature\n3.1 God and His Nature\n\nOne can see from the foregoing that Plantinga-type objections are not\ncompelling. The reason, again, is that DDS cannot be made sense of\nwithin a nonconstituent ontology. It can be made sense of, assuming it\ncan be made sense of, only within a constituent ontology, the style of\nontology presupposed by its main defender, Aquinas. A nonconstituent\nontologist like Plantinga may be represented as arguing by Modus\nPonens: If God exemplifies his nature, then he is distinct from it;\nGod exemplifies his nature; ergo, God is distinct from his nature, and\nDDS is false. But the constituent ontologist is justified in switching\nto Modus Tollens: If God exemplifies his nature, then he is distinct\nfrom it; God is not distinct from his nature; ergo, God does not\nexemplify his nature but has his nature by being identical with\nit.\n\nWe have just seen how God can be identical to his nature where\n\u201ccan be\u201d is elliptical for \u201ccan be conceived without\nobvious incoherence.\u201d But there are two other problems that also\npose a serious threat to the coherence of DDS. One concerns how God\ncan be identical to his existence, the other how the divine attributes\ncan be identical to each other.\n",
