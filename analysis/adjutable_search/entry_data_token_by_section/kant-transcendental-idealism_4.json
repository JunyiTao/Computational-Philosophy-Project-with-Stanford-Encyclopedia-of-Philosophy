    "main_text": "The Feder-Garve Review and Kant\u2019s Replies || The Feder-Garve review\n2.1 The Feder-Garve review\n\nAlthough it is uncharitable and, on some points, simply mistaken, the\nfirst published review of the Critique, originally written by\nChristian Garve and then substantially revised, and shortened, by\nJ.G.H. Feder, raised an issue that has been discussed ever\n since.[8]\n The G\u00f6ttingen, or \u201cFeder-Garve\u201d review, as it is now\nknown, claims that Kantian \u201ctranscendental\u201d idealism is\njust idealism of a familiar Berkeleyan or phenomenalist variety\n(Sassen 2000: 53).\n\nFirst of all, it should be noted that the Feder-Garve view, while not\nexactly an exercise in interpretive charity, is not without a basis in\nclaiming that there is a deep similarity between Berkeley and the\nCritique (this point is brought out well in Beiser 2002:\n49\u201352). First of all, Kant repeatedly claims that empirical\nobjects are representations. For instance, in the\n\u201cTranscendental Aesthetic\u201d he writes that \u201cwhat we\ncall outer objects are nothing other than mere representations of our\nsensibility\u201d (A30/B45) and in the \u201cFourth\nParalogism\u201d he writes: \u201cexternal objects (bodies) are\nmerely appearances, hence also nothing other than a species of my\nrepresentations\u201d (A370; see also A30/B45, A104 and A375n, A490,\nA498, A563). Since \u201crepresentation\u201d [Vorstellung]\nis Kant\u2019s term for what Berkeley calls \u201cideas\u201d, this\nseems at least perilously close to the Berkeleyan view that bodies are\ncollections of ideas. Secondly, the A Edition is full of passages that\ncan easily suggest a phenomenalist view of objects in space, such as:\n\n\n\nWhy do we have need of a doctrine of the soul grounded merely on pure\nrational principles? Without doubt chiefly with the intent of securing\nour thinking Self from the danger of materialism. But this is achieved\nby the rational concept of our thinking Self that we have given. For\naccording to it, so little fear remains that if one took matter away\nthen all thinking and even the existence of thinking beings would be\nabolished, that it rather shows clearly that if I were to take away\nthe thinking subject, the whole corporeal world would have to\ndisappear, as this is nothing but the appearance in the sensibility of\nour subject and one mode of its representations. (A383; cf. A374n,\nA490\u20131/B518\u20139, A520/B492\u2013A521/B493, A494/B522)\n\n\nOn one plausible reading of these passages, Kant is claiming that all\nthere is for objects in space to exist is for us to have experiences\nas of objects in space. Consequently, if we did not exist, or did not\nhave such experiences, these objects would not exist. The Feder-Garve\ninterpretation of transcendental idealism is not without some\n merit.[9]\n",
