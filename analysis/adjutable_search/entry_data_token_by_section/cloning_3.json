    "main_text": "Cloning for Research and Therapy || The Need for Oocytes\n2.2 The Need for Oocytes\n\nCloning for research and therapy requires a large number of\nhigh-quality donor oocytes. Ethical issues arise regarding how these\noocytes could be obtained. Oocyte donation involves various risks and\ndiscomforts (for a review of the risks, see Committee on Assessing the\nMedical Risks of Human Oocyte Donation for Stem Cell\nResearch, 2007). Among the most pressing ethical issues\nraised by participating in such donation is what model of informed\nconsent should be applied. Unlike women who are considering IVF,\nnon-medical oocyte donors are not clinical patients. They do not stand\nto derive any reproductive or medical benefit themselves from the\ndonation (though Kalfoglou & Gittelsohn, 2000, argue that they may\nderive a psychological benefit). Magnus and Cho (2005) have argued\nthat donating women should not be classified as research subjects\nsince, unlike in other research, the risks to the donor do not lie in\nthe research itself but in the procurement of the materials required\nfor the research. They suggest that a new category named\n\u2018research donors\u2019 be created for those who expose\nthemselves to substantial risk only for the benefit of others (in this\ncase unidentifiable people in the future) and where the risk is\nincurred not in the actual research but in the procurement of the\nmaterials for the research. Informed consent for altruistic organ\ndonation by living donors to strangers has also been suggested as a\nmodel, since, in both cases, the benefits will be for strangers and\nnot for the donor. Critics of this latter suggestion have pointed out,\nhowever, that there is a disanalogy between these two types of\ndonation. The general ethical rule reflected in regulations concerning\naltruistic donation, namely that there must be a high chance of a good\noutcome for the patient, is violated in the case of oocyte donation\nfor cloning research (George 2007).\n\nGiven the risks to the donor, the absence of direct medical benefit\nfor the donor, and the uncertain potential of cloning research, it is\nnot surprising that the number of altruistic oocyte donations for such\nresearch is very low. Financial incentives might be needed to increase\nthe supply of oocytes for cloning research. In some countries,\nincluding the US, selling and buying oocytes is legal. Some object to\nthese practices because they consider oocytes as integral to the body\nand think they should be kept out of the market: on their view, the\nvalue of the human body and its parts should not be expressed in terms\nof money or other fungible goods. Some also worry that, through\ncommercialization of oocytes, women themselves may become objects of\ninstrumental use (Alpers &Lo 1995). Many agree, however, that a\nconcern for commodification does not justify a complete ban on payment\nof oocyte donors and that justice requires that they be financially\ncompensated for the inconvenience, burden, and medical risk they\nendure, as is standard for other research subjects (Steinbock 2004;\nMertes &Pennings 2007). A related concern is the effect of\nfinancial or other offers of compensation on the voluntariness of\noocyte donation. Women, especially economically disadvantaged women\nfrom developing countries, might be unduly induced or even coerced\ninto selling their oocytes (Dickinson 2002). Baylis and McLeod (2007)\nhave highlighted how difficult it is concomitantly to avoid both undue\ninducement and exploitation: a price that is too low risks\nexploitation; a price that avoids exploitation risks undue\ninducement.\n\nConcerns about exploitation are not limited to concerns about payment,\nas became clear in the \u2018Hwang scandal\u2019 (for a review, see\nSaunders & Savulescu 2008). In 2004, Woo-Suk-Hwang, a leading\nKorean stem cell scientist, claimed to be the first to clone human\nembryos using SCNT and to extract stem cells from these embryos. In\naddition to finding that Hwang had fabricated many of his research\nresults, Korea\u2019s National Bioethics Committee also found that\nHwang had pressured junior members of his lab to donate oocytes for\nhis cloning experiments.\n\nSome authors have argued that a regulated market in oocytes\ncould minimize ethical concerns raised by the commercialization of\noocytes and could be consistent with respect for women (Resnik 2001;\nGruen 2007). Researchers are also investigating the use of alternative\nsources of oocytes, including animal oocytes, fetal oocytes, oocytes\nfrom adult ovaries obtained post mortem or during operation, and stem\ncell-derived oocytes. Scientists have already succeeded in creating\nhuman oocytes from embryonic stem cells (Ma et al. 2017; Saitou &\nMiyauchi 2016). Finally, another option is \u2018egg-sharing\u2019\nwhere couples who are undergoing IVF for reproductive purposes have\nthe option to donate one or two of their oocytes in return for a\nreduced fee for their fertility treatment. The advantage of this\nsystem is that it avoids exposing women to extra risks \u2013 these\nwomen were undergoing IVF in any case (Roberts & Throsby\n2008).\n",
