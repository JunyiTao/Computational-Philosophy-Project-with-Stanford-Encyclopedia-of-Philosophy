    "main_text": "What Kind of Power Is Domination? || Non-Moralized, Norm-Independent Theories\n4.1 Non-Moralized, Norm-Independent Theories\n\nTheories identifying domination with even unexercised power tend away\nfrom moralization and norm-dependence. If A has a great deal of\npower over B, A will be well positioned to wrong\nB, or to force B at least to act like A has\nauthority. Non-moralized/norm-independent theories maintain that this\nis not essential to domination. What is essential? Roughly, that\nA has an unchecked or uncontrolled power to impose their will\non B, to shape the framework of choices available to B\nso that B is highly likely to cooperate with A. The\ndisagreements among non-moralized/norm-independent theorists are about\nthe kind of checks or control that might prevent domination, and about\nhow imposition works.\n\nMost non-moralized/norm-independent theories follow in the wake of\nneorepublicanism, and share its basic approach\u2014theorizing\ndomination in two movements: identifying a kind of power manifest in\ndomination but also in non-dominating social relationships; then\nidentifying the feature of domination that separates it from the power\nmanifest in those non-dominating relationships. Usually, the second\nmovement describes the controls or checks present in non-dominating\nsocial relationships and absent from the dominating ones. These two\nmotives will be treated in order below:\n\nFirst, what kind of social power is of interest to a theory of\ndomination? Neorepublicans like Pettit focus on the capacity to\ninterfere with an individual\u2019s choices, by replacing, removing,\nand/or misrepresenting these choices. A can interfere with\nB\u2019s choices by removing potential objects of\nchoice: suppose A runs over B\u2019s bicycle,\ndestroying it. This removes the option of riding B\u2019s\nbike. Suppose instead A knifes the tire: this replaces\nB\u2019s option of riding their bike with another option:\nriding the bike after the tire is replaced or repaired.\nRemoval and replacement are both objective\nforms of choice interference: mind-independent alternatives been\nremoved or replaced. Misrepresentation of options is\ncognitive: e.g., A lies to B and says that only\nidiots have bikes like B\u2019s. If B is credulous and\nrefuses to ride their bike from embarrassment, A manages in\nthis way to interfere with B by misrepresentation (see Pettit\n2012).\n\nThis general emphasis on choice is what provokes the\nover-generalization worries already introduced (Shapiro 2012; Friedman\n2008; Blunt 2015; McCammon 2015). Some choices clearly have more\nweight than others. Nobody thinks having no choice about where to sit\nin a caf\u00e9 matters compared to having no choice about where to\nlive. Connecting the former as well as the latter to dominating\nvarieties of choice-interference, because both might represent, e.g.,\nthe removal or replacement of an option, seems to exaggerate the idea\nof domination. If, however, we want to keep domination and the\nreduction of freedom conceptually connected, there is reason to see\ndomination in all power to interfere, at least when that power is\noutside the control of the interferee.\n\nWhile Pettit analyzes domination in terms of choice-interference, his\nfavorite heuristic focuses directly on dominated agents, and the way\nthey are social related to their dominators. To be dominated, for\nPettit, is to fail \u201cthe eyeball test\u201d: i.e., you cannot\n\u201clook others in the eye without reason for the fear or deference\nthat a power of interference might inspire\u201d (2012: 84). Other\ntheories share this emphasis on domination as a kind of power within a\nsocial relationship and tend to prefer it to talk of\nchoice-interference (Lovett 2010; McCammon 2015).\n\nWhat is a social relationship? A\u2019s social relatedness to\nB, first of all, seems to require strategic relatedness, in the\nsense that what B is likely to do is a function, at least in\npart, of what A does. To get from social relatedness to\ndomination has other requirements. It is difficult to see how A\ncould dominate B unless A has more power over B\nthan B has over A within their social relationship.\nFurther, for A to have power over B plausibly requires\nthat B cannot easily exit the relationship. If someone can\neasily get a new job just as good as the one they have already, their\n\u201cexit costs\u201d are low, and they will have a correspondingly\nlow dependence on the social relationship\u2014probably too low for\ndomination to occur (Lovett 2010). It may be that A\u2019s\npower over B, and B\u2019s exit costs from their social\nrelationship, are not really separate conditions, that\nA\u2019s power over B is a function of A\u2019s\ncontrol of resources B cannot access except through A\n(see Pansardi 2013).\n\nA capacity for choice-interference, or social relatedness however\nrendered, is necessary but not sufficient for domination on a\nnon-moralized/norm-independent theory. To get domination, something\nmore is required than mere choice-interference or power within a\nsocial relationship.\n\nNeorepublicans first referred to this \u201csomething more\u201d as\nthe arbitrariness of dominating power, and still do with some\nregularity, but Pettit himself now favors the language of control or\nthe absence of control (2012: 57\u201358). This move was an attempt\nto emphasize the non-moralized nature of his theory. (For criticism\nconnected to this shift in Pettit\u2019s presentation, see especially\nChristman 1998, Costa 2007, and McMahon 2005.) The terminological\nshift was probably wise, given the natural tendency to contrast\narbitrary power with power backed by good reasons or power put to good\npurpose. Arbitrary power, for neorepublicans, has never been merely\nunreasoned power. Though Pettit earlier emphasized the connection\nbetween arbitrary power and power that fails to track the\n\u201cinterests\u201d of those subject to it, he measured interests\nnot by an independent notion of the objective good or objectively\nreasonable, but by appeal to what interests are \u201cavowed\u201d\nor \u201cavowal-ready\u201d (2006: 275\u2013276). The language of\ncontrol also has echoes in his earlier work. For example, in\nRepublicanism he says that an act is arbitrary \u201cby\nvirtue of the controls\u2014or more precisely the lack of\ncontrols\u2014under which it materializes\u201d (1997: 55). This\nshift toward domination as uncontrolled power follows Pettit\u2019s\nmore recent attempts to contrast domination with well-constructed\ndemocracy, but the opposition of democratically constrained power and\ndominating power reflects his earlier insistence that we cannot know\nwhen power is arbitrary except \u201cby recourse to public discussion\nin which people may speak for themselves and for the groups to which\nthey belong\u201d (1997: 56). Here, too, he connects his own theory\nto Iris Young\u2019s account of domination in Justice and the\nPolitics of Difference. Young says that domination is the\n\u201copposite\u201d of \u201cthorough social and political\ndemocracy\u201d and defines life within structures of domination as\nliving under others who \n\n\ncan determine without reciprocation the conditions of [the dominated\nperson\u2019s] actions, either directly or by virtue of the\nstructural consequences of their actions. (1990 [2011: 38])\n\n\nOf course, for a non-moralized theory, identifying domination as\nanti-democratic must involve a non-moralized account of democracy.\nThis is not necessarily a problem, given that we can describe\npolitical institutions as \u201cdemocratic\u201d in a merely\ndescriptive sense. (e.g., someone who says, \u201cThe expansion of\nthe franchise leads to a more democratic society\u201d might simply\nmean that a larger percentage of the population gets to vote and think\nthat is a terrible idea and a reason not to expand the franchise.)\nWhat is more difficult is showing how even broadly democratic states\nare non-dominating if we think the absence of domination involves\nliteral control of the state by those it governs. It is clear\nthat the vast majority of individual citizens do not control their\nstate in any meaningful way; given the enormity of contemporary\nstates, it is unclear how they could. We might say that they should\nrest content with a fair share of control, or with a fair chance at\ncontrol. But to say that we avoid domination when we have a fair share\nof control looks very much like a way of moralizing the theory, since\nfairness is clearly a moral notion. (Pettit\u2019s primary\nattempt to explain non-domination in terms of democratic political\narrangements can be found especially in the final three chapters of\nOn the People\u2019s Terms. For more interpretation and\ncriticism of Pettit\u2019s idea of control, see Arnold & Harris\n2017, Mayer 2015, Schink 2013, Sharon 2015, Simpson 2017, and Kolodny\nforthcoming.)\n\nFrank Lovett argues that avoiding domination does not require\ndemocracy, but instead subjecting the powerful to reliably enforced\nand widely known rules. Perhaps democracy does, in fact, most\neffectively reduce domination, but this should follow from substantive\nargument, not from the mere analysis of concepts (Lovett 2010). Also,\nthere is reason to think that subordinate groups are less dominated\nwhenever their overlords must abide by reliably enforced and widely\nknown rules, even when those rules do not express the will of the\nsubordinated in any way. Lovett uses the following case to make his\npoint:\n\n\nSuppose that for various historical, economic, and cultural reasons,\none group in some society manages to acquire a preponderance of social\npower, which it wields over the other groups in that society directly\nand without constraint, much to its own benefit. Since the subordinate\ngroups are in no position to challenge directly the preeminence of the\npowerful group, they instead demand only that the various rights and\nprivileges of the latter be written down, codified, and impartially\nenforced by independent judges. In time, let us suppose, the powerful\ngroup accedes to this demand, on the view that since the rules will be\ndesigned to benefit them, after all, there will be no significant cost\nin their doing so. (2012: 147)\n\n\nIf power is organized and systematized in law, it does sound odd to\ncall it arbitrary. After all, it may be entirely predictable\nin such circumstances. Lovett tacks closer to the commonsense idea\nthat what is arbitrary is unpredictable, unreasoned, and unfettered by\nrules. He even claims that \u201creal-world systems of\ndomination\u201d like Jim Crow and South African apartheid might\ncease to be dominating in possible worlds where they managed\n\u201cstrict adherence to explicit rules and procedures\u201d (2010:\n101). That such regimes would remain oppressive is obvious, but he\nbelieves this should be explained by the presence of other political\nevils than domination. Instead of a substantive account of\narbitrary power\u2014where power dominates when it isn\u2019t forced\nto track the will of those subject to it\u2014he recommends\nproceduralism: power dominates because it isn\u2019t\n\u201creliably constrained by effective rules, procedures, or goals\nthat are common knowledge to all persons or groups concerned\u201d\n(Lovett 2010: 96\u201397; 2012; for more treatment of the debate\nbetween Pettit and Lovett about the nature of arbitrary power, see the\nsection on\n \u201cWhat Counts as Arbitrary Power?\u201d\n in the entry on\n republicanism.)\n\nLovett\u2019s arguments for proceduralism have provoked several\nclarifications of what substantivism requires. Proceduralism\nhighlights what Gwilym David Blunt (2015) calls \u201csources\u201d of\ndomination that are personal as opposed to social,\nand \u201csites\u201d of domination that are interactional\nas opposed to systemic. Widely known and reliably enforced\nchecks on power, of the kind emphasized by proceduralism, really do\nreduce domination enabled by personal sources of power like\nA\u2019s possession of more guns or guile than B,\nespecially when this power is expressed in the interactions of\nA and B as individual agents. If A and B\nare neighbors, and A has a huge stockpile of weapons and\nB has none, it makes sense to think of B\u2019s\ncomplaint against A as a matter of their intense vulnerability\nto power constrained only by A\u2019s whims. Substantivism may\nbe better equipped to recognize domination in what Blunt calls social\n\u201csources\u201d and systemic \u201csites\u201d. In actual\nsystems of domination, A often has power over B not\nbecause A alone has more power (e.g., by having more guns of\ntheir own), but because A and B both live within a\nsystem intended to advantage A\u2019s group and disadvantage\nB\u2019s. Often, in such cases, A has power to adjust\nthe system, or access to such power, while B does not.\n\nThere is another way to account for proceduralism\u2019s insistence\nthat reliably enforced, common-knowledge rules reduce domination even\nwithout democratic constraints. When A alone decides whether\nand how to harass B, A\u2019s power to harass B\nis checked only by A\u2019s sense of what is best or what\nshould be done. Suppose A lives in a society that introduces a\nreliably enforced, common-knowledge rule that A can harass\nB only by putting B in the stocks but may not whip\nB. This changes the situation both for A and B.\nNow, A alone does not decide whether and how to harass\nB: now, A is not checked simply by what A thinks\nthey have reason to do. In this way, A\u2019s power is less\n\u201cdeliberatively isolated\u201d (McCammon 2015). If this is\nright, domination can be reduced even by non-democratic reforms.\nHowever, laws and other limits on individual power may be formed by\nwhole groups in a deliberatively isolated manner, as under Jim Crow\nand apartheid, if the members of A\u2019s group have input\ninto the rules, but the members of B\u2019s group do not.\nEmpowered groups often dictate the terms of their dealings with\nsubordinated groups based only on their own sense of how things should\nbe, and the deliberatively isolated power of groups may be\nstrengthened by measures that reduce the deliberative isolation of\nindividuals. \n",
