    "main_text": "Knowledge as Justified True Belief\n1. Knowledge as Justified True Belief\n\nThere are three components to the traditional\n(\u201ctripartite\u201d) analysis of knowledge. According to this\nanalysis, justified, true belief is necessary and sufficient for\nknowledge.\n\nThe Tripartite Analysis of Knowledge:\nS knows that p iff\n\n\np is true;\nS believes that p;\nS is justified in believing that p.\n\n\n\nThe tripartite analysis of knowledge is often abbreviated as the\n\u201cJTB\u201d analysis, for \u201cjustified true\nbelief\u201d.\n\nMuch of the twentieth-century literature on the analysis of knowledge\ntook the JTB analysis as its starting-point. It became something of a\nconvenient fiction to suppose that this analysis was widely accepted\nthroughout much of the history of philosophy. In fact, however, the\nJTB analysis was first articulated in the twentieth century by its\n attackers.[1]\n Before turning to influential twentieth-century\narguments against the JTB theory, let us briefly consider the three\ntraditional components of knowledge in turn.\n",
