Neolithic burial practices\nappear to express spiritual beliefs and provide early evidence for at\nleast minimally reflective thought about the nature of human\nconsciousness (Pearson 1999, Clark and Riel-Salvatore 2001).\nPreliterate cultures have similarly been found invariably to embrace\nsome form of spiritual or at least animist view that indicates a degree\nof reflection about the nature of conscious awareness.\n\n\nNonetheless, some have argued that consciousness as we know it today\nis a relatively recent historical development that arose sometime after\nthe Homeric era (Jaynes 1974). According to this view, earlier humans\nincluding those who fought the Trojan War did not experience themselves\nas unified internal subjects of their thoughts and actions, at least\nnot in the ways we do today. Others have claimed that even during the\nclassical period, there was no word of ancient Greek that corresponds\nto \u201cconsciousness\u201d (Wilkes 1984, 1988, 1995). Though the\nancients had much to say about mental matters, it is less clear whether\nthey had any specific concepts or concerns for what we now think of as \nconsciousness.\n\n\nAlthough the words \u201cconscious\u201d and\n\u201cconscience\u201d are used quite differently today, it is likely\nthat the Reformation emphasis on the latter as an inner source of truth\nplayed some role in the inward turn so characteristic of the modern\nreflective view of self. The Hamlet who walked the stage in 1600\nalready saw his world and self with profoundly modern eyes.\n\n\nBy the beginning of the early modern era in the seventeenth century,\nconsciousness had come full center in thinking about the mind. Indeed\nfrom the mid-17th through the late 19th century, consciousness was\nwidely regarded as essential or definitive of the mental. Ren\u00e9\nDescartes defined the very notion of thought (pens\u00e9e) in terms of\nreflexive consciousness or self-awareness. In the Principles of\nPhilosophy (1640) he wrote,\nBy the word \u2018thought\u2019\n(\u2018pens\u00e9e\u2019) I understand all that of which we are\nconscious as operating in us.\n\n\nLater, toward the end of the 17th century, John Locke offered a\nsimilar if slightly more qualified claim in An Essay on Human\nUnderstanding (1688),\nI do not say there is no soul in man because he is not\nsensible of it in his sleep. But I do say he can not think at any time,\nwaking or sleeping, without being sensible of it. Our being sensible of\nit is not necessary to anything but our thoughts, and to them it is and\nto them it always will be necessary.\n\n\nLocke explicitly forswore making any hypothesis about the\nsubstantial basis of consciousness and its relation to matter, but he\nclearly regarded it as essential to thought as well as to personal\nidentity.\n\n\nLocke's contemporary G.W. Leibniz, drawing possible inspiration from\nhis mathematical work on differentiation and integration, offered a\ntheory of mind in the Discourse on Metaphysics (1686) that\nallowed for infinitely many degrees of consciousness and perhaps even\nfor some thoughts that were unconscious, the so called \u201cpetites\nperceptions\u201d. Leibniz was the first to distinguish explicitly\nbetween perception and apperception, i.e., roughly between awareness\nand self-awareness. In the Monadology (1720) he also offered\nhis famous analogy of the mill to express his belief that consciousness\ncould not arise from mere matter. He asked his reader to imagine\nsomeone walking through an expanded brain as one would walk through a\nmill and observing all its mechanical operations, which for Leibniz\nexhausted its physical nature. Nowhere, he asserts, would such an\nobserver see any conscious thoughts.\n\n\nDespite Leibniz's recognition of the possibility of unconscious\nthought, for most of the next two centuries the domains of thought and\nconsciousness were regarded as more or less the same. Associationist\npsychology, whether pursued by Locke or later in the eighteenth century\nby David Hume (1739) or in the nineteenth by James Mill (1829), aimed\nto discover the principles by which conscious thoughts or ideas\ninteracted or affected each other. James Mill's son, John Stuart Mill\ncontinued his father's work on associationist psychology, but he\nallowed that combinations of ideas might produce resultants that went\nbeyond their constituent mental parts, thus providing an early model of\nmental emergence (1865).\n\n\nThe purely associationist approach was critiqued in the late\neighteenth century by Immanuel Kant (1787), who argued that an adequate\naccount of experience and phenomenal consciousness required a far\nricher structure of mental and intentional organization. Phenomenal\nconsciousness according to Kant could not be a mere succession of\nassociated ideas, but at a minimum had to be the experience of a\nconscious self situated in an objective world structured with respect\nto space, time and causality.\n\n\nWithin the Anglo-American world, associationist approaches continued\nto be influential in both philosophy and psychology well into the\ntwentieth century, while in the German and European sphere there was a\ngreater interest in the larger structure of experience that led in\npart to the study of phenomenology through the work of Edmund Husserl\n(1913, 1929), Martin Heidegger (1927), Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1945) and\nothers who expanded the study of consciousness into the realm of the\nsocial, the bodily and the interpersonal.\n\n\nAt the outset of modern scientific psychology in the mid-nineteenth\ncentury, the mind was still largely equated with consciousness, and\nintrospective methods dominated the field as in the work of Wilhelm\nWundt (1897), Hermann von Helmholtz (1897), William James (1890) and\nAlfred Titchener (1901). However, the relation of consciousness to\nbrain remained very much a mystery as expressed in T. H. Huxley's\nfamous remark,\nHow it is that anything so remarkable as a state of\nconsciousness comes about as a result of irritating nervous tissue, is\njust as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin, when Aladdin\nrubbed his lamp (1866).\n\n\nThe early twentieth century saw the eclipse of consciousness from\nscientific psychology, especially in the United States with the rise of\nbehaviorism (Watson 1924, Skinner 1953) though movements such as\nGestalt psychology kept it a matter of ongoing scientific concern in\nEurope (K\u00f6hler 1929, K\u00f6ffka 1935). In the 1960s, the grip of\nbehaviorism weakened with the rise of cognitive psychology and its\nemphasis on information processing and the modeling of internal mental\nprocesses (Neisser 1965, Gardiner 1985). However, despite the renewed\nemphasis on explaining cognitive capacities such as memory, perception\nand language comprehension, consciousness remained a largely neglected\ntopic for several further decades.\n\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s there was a major resurgence of scientific and\nphilosophical research into the nature and basis of consciousness\n(Baars 1988, Dennett 1991, Penrose 1989, 1994, Crick 1994, Lycan 1987,\n1996, Chalmers 1996). Once consciousness was back under discussion,\nthere was a rapid proliferation of research with a flood of books and\narticles, as well as the introduction of specialty journals (The\nJournal of Consciousness Studies, Consciousness and Cognition,\nPsyche), professional societies (Association for the Scientific\nStudy of Consciousness\u2014ASSC) and annual conferences devoted\nexclusively to its investigation (\u201cThe Science of\nConsciousness\u201d).\n",
