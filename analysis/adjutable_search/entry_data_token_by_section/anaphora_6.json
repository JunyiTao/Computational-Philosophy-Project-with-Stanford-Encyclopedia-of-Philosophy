    "main_text": "Recent Theories of Problematic Anaphora || The Context Dependent Quantifier Approach\n3.4 The Context Dependent Quantifier Approach\n\nThe Context Dependent Quantifier, or CDQ, account of anaphora was\nsuggested in Wilson (1984) and subsequently developed in King (1987,\n1991,\n 1994).[30]\n The idea underlying the application of CDQ to discourse anaphora is\nthat these expressions look like quantifier-like expressions of\ngenerality, where the precise nature of the generality they express is\ndetermined by features of the linguistic context in which they occur.\nOn the CDQ account, anaphoric pronouns with quantifier antecedents in\ndiscourse anaphora are contextually sensitive devices of\nquantification. That is, these anaphoric pronouns express\nquantifications; and which quantifications they\nexpress is partly a function of the linguistic environments\nin which they are embedded. Consider the following discourses:\n\n(51)\n A man\nfrom Sweden climbed Mt. Everest alone. He used no oxygen.\n(52)\n Most students passed the exam. They didn\u2019t get scores below\n70%.\n\n\nLooking at (51), suppose that in fact at least one Swede has soloed\nMt. Everest without oxygen. Then it would seem that the sentences of\n(51) are true. If this is correct, then it appears that the second\nsentence of (51) expresses a (existentially) general claim.\nCDQ claims that the pronoun \u201cHe\u201d in the second sentence is\nitself a (existential) quantifier, and this explains why the second\nsentence expresses a general claim: the generality is a result of the\npresence of this quantifier in the sentence. Similar remarks apply to\n(52), (except that \u201cThey\u201d expresses a universal\nquantifier). Further, consider the following example, which is similar\nto our example (18) above:\n\n(53)\n A man\nkilled Alan last night. Michelle believes he used a knife to kill\nhim.\n\n\nThe second sentence of this discourse appears to have two different\nreadings. On one reading, it asserts that concerning the man who\nkilled Alan last night, Michelle believes of that very man\nthat he used a knife. This would be the case if, for example, Michelle\nknew the man who killed Alan, believed that he killed Alan and based\non his well-known fondness of knives, believed he used this sort of\nweapon. But the second sentence has another reading on which it\nascribes to Michelle the general belief to the effect that a man\nkilled Alan with a knife last night. On this reading the sentence\nwould be true if e.g., on the basis of conversations with personnel at\nthe hospital and having no particular person in mind, Michelle\nbelieved that a man fatally stabbed Alan last night.\n\nAgain, CDQ claims these facts are to be explained by holding that the\npronoun in the second sentence is a quantifier. For then we should\nexpect that, like other quantifiers, it could take wide or narrow\nscope relative to \u201cMichelle believes\u201d. On the wide scope\nreading of the pronoun/quantifier, the second sentence attributes to\nMichelle a belief regarding a particular person. On the narrow scope\nreading, it attributes to Michelle a general belief.\n\nOccurrences of \u201cordinary quantifiers\u201d, such as\n\u201cevery man\u201d have what we might call a force, in\nthis case universal; what we might call a restriction, in\nthis case the set of men; and scope relative to other\noccurrences of quantifiers, verbs of propositional attitude, and so\non. CDQ claims that the anaphoric pronouns in question also have\nforces (universal, existential, etc.), restrictions\n(\u201cdomains over which they quantify\u201d) and scopes\nrelative to each other, verbs of propositional attitude, etc. However,\nunlike \u201cordinary\u201d quantifiers, these anaphoric pronouns\nqua quantifiers have their forces, restrictions and relative scopes\ndetermined by features of their linguistic environments. King (1994)\nlays out how the forces, restrictions and relative scopes of these\nanaphoric pronouns are determined, and we shall not describe those\ndetails here.\n\nAs to donkey anaphora, without going through the details, let me just\nsay that CDQ assigns to a relative clause donkey sentence such as\n (26)\n above (repeated here)\n\n(26)\n Every woman who\nowns a donkey beats it.\n\n\ntruth conditions according to which (26) is true iff every woman who\nowns a donkey beats some donkey she owns (see King 2004 for details\nand discussion). Some think that the truth of (26) requires every\nwoman who owns a donkey to beat every donkey she owns, and as\nwe saw, DRT, DPL, and the D-type theories discussed assign these truth\nconditions to (26) (though this is not an essential feature of DRT or\ndynamic semantic approaches more generally). The truth conditions CDQ\nassigns to (26) correspond to what is often called the weak\nreading of donkey sentences (Chierchia (1995) calls this the\n\\(\\exists\\)-reading) and the truth conditions the accounts discussed thus far\ncorrespond to the strong reading of donkey sentences\n(Chierchia calls this the \\(\\forall\\)-reading). There actually has been a debate\nin the literature as to which truth conditions sentences like (26)\nhave. There are sentences that are exactly like (26) except for the\ndescriptive material in them that clearly seem to have (only) the weak\nreading. An example is:\n\n(54)\n Every\nperson who had a credit card paid his bill with it.\n\n\nIt seems clear that the truth of this sentence does not require every\nperson with a credit card to pay his bill with each credit card he\nhas. We will discuss these matters further in\n section 4,\n but for now let us simply note that CDQ differs from the other\naccounts discussed on what truth conditions should be assigned to\nsentences like (26) and (54) and that it is simply unclear which truth\nconditions are the correct ones.\n\nAs for conditional donkey anaphora, the CDQ account is rather\ncomplicated and we are only able to provide the briefest outline of\nthe account here (interested readers should consult King 2004). As we\nsaw above, a conditional donkey sentence such as\n (25)\n\n\n(25)\n If Sarah owns a\ndonkey, she beats it.\n\n\nis true iff Sarah beats every donkey she owns. Thus, \u201ca\ndonkey\u201d somehow seems to have ended up with universal force. The\nCDQ account holds that this illusion of universal force for the\nindefinite is really the result of the interaction of the semantics of\nthe conditional, the indefinite, understood as an existential\nquantifier, and the CDQ \u201cshe\u201d, understood as a\ncontext dependent quantifier with existential force ranging over\ndonkeys Sarah owns. Roughly, the account goes as follows. The\nantecedent of (25) is equivalent to\n\n(25a)\n \\((\\exists x)(x\n\\mbox{ is a donkey} \\mathbin{\\&} \\mbox{Sarah owns }\nx)\\)\n\n\nGiven the CDQ \u201cit\u201d and its context in (25), the consequent\nof (25) is equivalent to\n\n(25b)\n \\((\\exists x)(x\n\\mbox{ is a donkey} \\mathbin{\\&} \\mbox{Sarah owns } x\n\\mathbin{\\&} \\mbox{Sarah beats } x)\\)\n\n\nThe semantics of the conditional involves universal quantification\nover minimal situations. In particular, a conditional claims that for\nevery minimal situation \\(s_1\\) in which its antecedent is true, there\nis a situation \\(s_2\\) that \\(s_1\\) is part of in which its consequent\nis true. In the case of (25), a minimal situation in which the\nantecedent is true consists of Sarah and a single donkey she owns. The\nfinal element here is that the definiteness and/or anaphoricness of\nthe CDQ \u201cit\u201d in the consequent of (25) makes a difference\nto its truth conditions. The definiteness and anaphoricness of\n\u201cit\u201d in (25) induces a sort of \u201cfamiliarity\n effect\u201d.[31]\n In particular, for any (minimal) \\(s_1\\) in which the antecedent is\ntrue, there must be an \\(s_2\\) that \\(s_1\\) is part of in which the\nconsequent (understood as expressing the claim that Sarah beats a\ndonkey she owns) is true. But in addition, because of the\n\u201cfamiliarity\u201d condition induced by the anaphoric definite\n\u201cit\u201d, there must be a donkey in \\(s_2\\) that is also in\n\\(s_1\\) and that makes the consequent true. In other words,\nfamiliarity requires that a donkey that makes the CDQ-containing\nconsequent true in \\(s_2\\) also be present in \\(s_1\\). In this sense,\nthe donkey is \u201cfamiliar\u201d, having been introduced by the\nantecedent and the situation \\(s_1\\) in which it is true. To see what\nthis means, consider a situation \\(s_1\\) that is a minimal situation\nin which the antecedent is true. \\(s_1\\) consists of Sarah owning a\nsingle donkey. If e.g., Sarah owns ten donkeys, there are ten such\nminimal situations. For (25) to be true, each such \\(s_1\\) must be\npart of a situation \\(s_2\\) such that \\(s_2\\) is a situation in which\nSarah beats a donkey that she owns and that is in \\(s_1\\). Now the\nonly way that every minimal \\(s_1\\) in which Sarah owns a donkey can\nbe part of an \\(s_2\\) in which Sarah beats a donkey she owns in\n\\(s_1\\) is if Sarah beats every donkey she owns. Thus, the CDQ account\nclaims that (25) is true iff Sarah beats every donkey she owns.\n\nTurning now to difficulties with CDQ, a main difficulty is that it\nisn\u2019t clear whether the use of the notion of\nfamiliarity in the account of conditional donkey sentences\ncan be ultimately upheld. Recall that the idea was that because\n\u201cit\u201d is a definite NP, and because definite NPs generally\nare thought to involve some sort of familiarity, the pronoun in the\ndonkey conditional induces a sort of familiarity effect. There are\nreally two distinct problems here. One is that though the pronoun\n\u201cit\u201d is \u201csyntactically\u201d definite in that the\npronoun \u201cit\u201d is thought to be a definite NP, according to\nCDQ it is \u201csemantically\u201d indefinite in (25), since it\nexpresses an existential quantification (over donkeys owned by Sarah).\nBut then if \u201cit\u201d really is semantically indefinite in\n(25), why should it induce familiarity effects at all? (Jason Stanley\n(p.c.) raised this difficulty). One might reply that it is the fact\nthat \u201cit\u201d is \u201csyntactically\u201d definite that\ntriggers the familiarity effects CDQ posits. But familiarity probably\nis not well enough understood to allow us to assess this response. A\nsecond, and perhaps more pressing, difficulty is this. Generally,\nfamiliarity has something to do with whether what an expression is\nbeing used to talk about is familiar or salient to the audience being\naddressed. This is vague, of course, but the idea is that if one says\n\u201cThe dog is hungry\u201d to an audience who isn\u2019t even\naware of any dog that is around or relevant to the conversation, the\nremark is somewhat infelicitous. That is because the definite NP\n\u201cThe dog\u201d was used to talk about something not familiar to\nthe audience. Now the question is: is it plausible to claim that this\nand related phenomena are related to the rather complex effect CDQ\nclaims is induced by the anaphoricness/definiteness of\n\u201cit\u201d in donkey conditionals? In the latter case, CDQ\nclaims the effect of familiarity is to make the CDQ \u201cit\u201d\nin the consequent of donkey conditionals quantify over donkeys in the\nminimal situations introduced by the antecedents of the conditionals\n(in the case of (25), situations consisting of Sarah and a single\ndonkey she owns). The CDQ can only quantify over\n\u201cfamiliar\u201d donkeys\u2014those introduced by the\nantecedent. One may well wonder whether the effect CDQ posits here can\nreally be seen to be a manifestation of phenomena that have\ntraditionally been explained in terms of familiarity.\n",
