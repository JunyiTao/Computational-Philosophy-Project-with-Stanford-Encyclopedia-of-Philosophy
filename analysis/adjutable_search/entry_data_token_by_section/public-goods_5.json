    "main_text": "Public Goods and Externalities\n2. Public Goods and Externalities\n\nExternalities are effects of economic transactions on individuals that\nare not party to the transaction. The paradigm example is pollution: a\ncompany produces some good the production process for which is\n\u201cdirty\u201d in that it affects individuals independently of\nwhether or not they are customers of the company. If such effects are\nundesired, as in the case of pollution, they are called\nnegative externalities; if they are desired,\npositive externalities. A paradigmatic example of a positive\nexternality is the pollination created by a honey producer\u2019s\nbees. Individuals benefit from pollination whether or not they buy\nhoney.\n\nPublic goods create positive externalities. Suppose a group of\nindividuals get together and pay some company to produce (analog)\nradio broadcasts. Individuals who are not party to the transaction can\nnow benefit from the good. Similarly, if a group of citizens get\ntogether to clean up a public park, individuals will benefit whether\nor not they were part of the group of citizen cleaners.\n\nThe existence of a public good implies the existence of (positive)\nexternalities, but the reverse is not true. The beekeeper\u2019s bees\nmay pollinate the trees in the neighbouring orchard, thereby\nincreasing its production, but that does not mean that it is\nimpossible to exclude others from this or other benefits or that these\nbenefits are non-rivalrous. \n",
