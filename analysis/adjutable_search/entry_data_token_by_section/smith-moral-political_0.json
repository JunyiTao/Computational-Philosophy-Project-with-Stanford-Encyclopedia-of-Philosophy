    "main_text": "Methodology\n1. Methodology\n\nSmith\u2019s Theory of Moral Sentiments (TMS) tends to\narouse sharply divergent reactions among the philosophers who pick it\nup. Kant is said to have considered it his favorite among Scottish\nmoral sense theories (Fleischacker 1991), but others have dismissed it\nas devoid of systematic argument, or derivative, in its theoretical\naspirations, of Hume. What explains these disparate reactions is one\nand the same feature of the book: that it consists largely of what\nSmith himself calls \u201cillustrations\u201d of the workings of the\nmoral sentiments (TMS, \u201cAdvertisement\u201d)\u2014short\nvignettes, elegantly described, that attempt to show what frightens us\nabout death, what we find interesting and what dull or distasteful\nabout other people\u2019s love affairs, how moral luck factors into\nour assessment of various actions (Garrett 2005; Hankins 2016), or how\nand why we deceive ourselves. To some, this provides the detail and\npsychological acuity that they find lacking in most moral philosophy;\nto others, it seems something more properly taken up by novelists or\nempirical psychologists, not the business of a philosopher. Indeed,\none prominent view of TMS is that it is a work in descriptive\npsychology or sociology, not a contribution to normative moral theory\n(Campbell 1971; Raphael 2007). This reading is hard to square with\nthe many normative judgments in TMS (see Hanley 2009, chapter 2 and\nOtteson 2002, chapter 6).  It also misses the force of Smith\u2019s\ninsistence that the proper way to make normative judgments is to\nconsider the details of a phenomenon from an impartial perspective: to\njudge the workings of our moral faculties, then, we need to consider\nthem, and their uses, in appropriate detail. Laying out in\ndetail how they work can help us see how they can be corrupted, and\ntherefore to avoid that corruption, at least to some extent (see TMS\n61\u20136, 92\u2013104). If this was Smith\u2019s goal\u2014and it\nfits the text of TMS very well\u2014then he was engaged not in the\nsociology or psychology but the phenomenology of morals,\ndescribing the workings of our modes of moral judgment as carefully as\npossible from within, and believing that the comprehensive view that\nresults can itself help guide us in moral judgment. Moral\nphenomenology is normative moral theory, for him, and there\nis no more foundational theory\u2014no set of general\nprinciples\u2014of which we might avail ourselves. Justification for\nhow we make moral judgments can only be found within the way we\nactually do make moral judgments; both moral justification and moral\ncritique must be immanent to, not transcendent of, our moral practice\n(compare TMS 313\u20134).\n\nA few implications of this approach. First, Smith is an\nanti-reductionist. He does not think morality can be reduced to a set\nof natural or divine laws, nor that it is simply a means for producing\n\u201cthe greatest happiness for the greatest number of\npeople,\u201d in the phrase coined by his teacher, Frances Hutcheson.\nHe indeed says explicitly, against the proto-utilitarianism of\nHutcheson and Hume, that philosophers in his day have paid too much\nattention to the consequences of actions, and he wants to focus\ninstead on their propriety: the relation they bear to the motive that\ninspires them (18\u201319). At the same time, he argues that the\nmoral systems proposed by Samuel Clarke, William Wollaston, and Lord\nShaftesbury overstress propriety, which is just one \u201cessential\ningredient\u201d in virtuous action (294; see also 265 and 326). His\nown view attempts to take account of all the essential ingredients in\nvirtue and moral judgment, and to resist the temptation to reduce\nthose ingredients to a single principle (see 326\u20137).\n\nSecond, and relatedly, Smith\u2019s way of approaching virtue often\nresembles Aristotle\u2019s\u2014who has also sometimes been seen as\ntoo fond of the description of virtue, and who tried to acknowledge\nthe many diverse elements of virtue, and the judgment of virtue,\nrather than to reduce them to a single principle. Smith says at the\nend of TMS that his system corresponds \u201cpretty exactly\u201d\nwith Aristotle\u2019s (271). The attentive reader of TMS will have\nnoticed this earlier: when he characterizes propriety as lying between\nthe excess and defect of passion (27), for instance, or when he\ndistinguishes the restraint of appetite out of self-interest from the\nvirtue of temperance (28), or when he emphasizes habit (152, 324), or\nthe superiority of friendships of virtue over friendships of pleasure\n(224\u20135).\n\nFinally, Smith\u2019s phenomenological method is interwoven\nwith his strong leanings toward particularism. He insists that general\nmoral rules are \u201cfounded upon experience of what, in particular\ninstances, our moral faculties, our natural sense of merit and\npropriety, approve, or disapprove of\u201d (159; see also 160 and\n320), and that our notions of right and wrong bottom out in these\nreactions to particular cases (320; see also 187 and Gill 2014). His\naccount of virtue as depending on our attempts to adjust ourselves as\nclosely as possible to the feelings of the particular others we\nencounter also suggests that what is virtuous in one set of\ncircumstances may not be so in different circumstances. These\ncommitments entail that moral theorists will give us little moral\nguidance if they present just the general structure of right and wrong\n(and Smith thinks that moral theory should help guide moral practice:\nTMS 293, 315). A fine-grained phenomenology of how we carry out\nvarious kinds of moral judgment, and the errors or infelicities to\nwhich we are prone in this process, will be far more helpful.\n",
