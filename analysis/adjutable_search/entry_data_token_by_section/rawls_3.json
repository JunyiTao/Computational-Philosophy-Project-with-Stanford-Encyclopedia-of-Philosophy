    "main_text": "Aims and Method || Ideal and Non-Ideal Theory\n2.3 Ideal and Non-Ideal Theory\n\nWithin each sub-domain of the political Rawls also follows a sequence:\nideal theory before non-ideal theory. Ideal theory makes two\ntypes of idealizing assumptions about its subject matter. First, ideal\ntheory assumes that all actors (citizens or societies) are generally\nwilling to comply with whatever principles are chosen. Ideal theory\nthus idealizes away the possibility of law-breaking, either by\nindividuals (crime) or societies (aggressive war). Second, ideal\ntheory assumes reasonably favorable social conditions, wherein\ncitizens and societies are able to abide by principles of political\ncooperation. Citizens are not so driven by hunger, for example, that\ntheir capacity for moral reasoning is overwhelmed; nor are nations\nstruggling to overcome famine or the failure of their states.\n\nCompleting ideal theory first, Rawls says, yields a systematic\nunderstanding of how to reform our non-ideal world, and fixes a vision\n(mentioned above) of what is the best that can be hoped for. Once\nideal theory is completed for a political sub-domain, non-ideal\ntheory can be set out by reference to the ideal. For instance,\nonce we find ideal principles for citizens who can be productive\nmembers of society over a complete life, we will be better able to\nframe non-ideal principles for providing health care to citizens with\nserious illnesses or disabilities. Similarly, once we understand the\nideal principles of international relations, we will better see how\nthe international community should act toward failed states, as well\nas toward aggressive states that threaten the peace.\n",
