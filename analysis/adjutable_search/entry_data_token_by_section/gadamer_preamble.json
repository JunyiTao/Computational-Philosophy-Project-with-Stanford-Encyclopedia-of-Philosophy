    "main_text": "\n\nHans-Georg Gadamer is the decisive figure in the development of\ntwentieth century hermeneutics\u2014almost certainly eclipsing, in\nterms of influence and reputation, the other leading figures,\nincluding Paul Ricoeur, and also Gianni Vattimo (Vattimo was himself\none of Gadamer\u2019s students). Profoundly affected by the\nphilosophy of Martin Heidegger (whose own influence on philosophical\nhermeneutics is pervasive despite Heidegger\u2019s abandonment of the term\nin his later thought), Gadamer was trained in neo-Kantian\nscholarship as well as in classical philology. Central to\nGadamer\u2019s mature philosophy is a distinctive and thoroughly\ndialogical approach, based in Platonic-Aristotelian as well as\nHeideggerian thinking, that rejects subjectivism and relativism,\nabjures any simple notion of interpretive method, and grounds\nunderstanding in the linguistically mediated happening of tradition.\nEmploying a more orthodox and modest, but also more accessible style\nthan Heidegger himself, Gadamer\u2019s work can be seen as\nconcentrated in four main areas: the first, and clearly the most\ninfluential, is the development and elaboration of a philosophical\nhermeneutics; the second is the dialogue within philosophy, and within\nthe history of philosophy, with respect to Plato and Aristotle in\nparticular, but also with Hegel and Heidegger; the third is the\nengagement with literature, particularly poetry, and with art; and the\nfourth is what Gadamer himself terms \u2018practical\nphilosophy\u2019 (Gadamer 2001, 78\u201385) encompassing\ncontemporary political and ethical issues. The dialogical character of\nGadamer\u2019s approach is evident, not merely in the central\ntheoretical role he gives to the concept of dialogue in his thinking,\nbut also in the discursive and dialogic, even\n\u2018conversational\u2019 character of his writing, as well as\nin his own personal commitment to intellectual engagement and exchange\n(Gadamer uses the German term Gespr\u00e4ch which can be\ntranslated as either dialogue or conversation). Indeed, Gadamer is one\nof the few philosophers for whom the \u2018interview\u2019 has\nbecome a significant category of philosophical output (see Hahn 1997,\n588\u2013599; also Gadamer 2001, 2003). Although he identified\nconnections between his own work and English-speaking\n\u2018analytic\u2019 thought (mainly via the later Wittgenstein, but\nalso Donald Davidson\u2014see Keane 2021), and has sometimes seen his\nideas taken up by thinkers such as Alasdair McIntyre (see MacIntyre\n2002), Ronald Dworkin (see Dworkin 1986), Robert Brandom (see Brandom\n2002), John McDowell (see McDowell 1996, 2002), and especially Richard\nRorty (Rorty 1979; see also Keane 2021), Gadamer is perhaps less well\nknown, and certainly less well-appreciated, in English-speaking\nphilosophical circles than are some of his near-contemporaries. He is\nundoubtedly, however, one of the most important thinkers of the\ntwentieth century, having had an enormous impact on a range of areas\nfrom aesthetics to jurisprudence, and having acquired a respect and\nreputation in Germany, and elsewhere in Europe, that went far beyond\nthe usual confines of academia.\n",
