    "main_text": "What is a social minimum? || The social minimum and relative deprivation\n1.3 The social minimum and relative deprivation\n\nWe have said that a social minimum is the bundle of resources\nnecessary for someone to live a minimally decent life in their\nsociety. Let\u2019s say we are talking, for the moment, about a\nparticular national society.\n\nThe question arises of how far the resources we need to live a\nminimally decent life in a given national society are affected by the\ngeneral level of opulence of this society. Is the social minimum\nhigher in nations that are wealthier than others? This question is\nclosely related to a question that has long exercised students of\nincome and wealth distribution: Is poverty a matter of absolute income\nor of relative income (or both)? Many studies of poverty assume that\npoverty has a relative dimension. Estimates of the number of\nhouseholds in poverty then take as the \u2018poverty line\u2019 a level of\nincome that is some fraction (say 50%) of average household income,\nadjusted for differences in household size. Thus, if the incomes of\nthe poor at time t2 are the same as they were at\ntime t1, and in this time average income has\nincreased, then on this approach we would have to conclude that the\npeople who were poor at t1 have become even poorer\nat t2 even though their absolute income level\nhas not changed. This clearly makes sense only if one thinks that\npoverty is a matter of how well off people are in income terms\nrelative to others in their society. However, this way of thinking\nabout poverty invites the objection that the researcher is confusing\npoverty with inequality. Critics argue that if one group has become\nworse off in income terms relative to others then inequality has\nincreased, but this does not mean that poverty has, especially if the\ngroup in question remains just as well off as before in terms of its\nabsolute level of income.\n\nThe ecumenical-capabilities approach outlined above offers reasonable\nsupport for the claim that the social minimum does vary with a\nnation\u2019s level of income/wealth, and in turn, for the claim that\npoverty can increase when a group falls further behind the rest of a\nnational society in terms of its income. Following Sen, capabilities\ntheorists argue that even if the capabilities that define a minimally\ndecent life remain basically the same across nations of varying income\nlevels, the resources needed to have a given capability will be\ngreater, in the case of some capabilities, the richer one\u2019s nation is.\nIn other words, the resource cost of a given capability will tend to\nincrease with national income. According to Sen:\n\n\nTo lead a life without shame, to be able to visit and entertain one\u2019s\nfriends, to keep track of what is going on and what others are talking\nabout\u2026requires a more expensive bundle of goods and services in\na society that is generally richer, and in which most people have,\nsay, means of transport, affluent clothing, radios or television sets,\netc.. (Sen 1987a: 18)\n\n\nFor this reason at least, the level and content of the social minimum\nin a given national society will to some extent be relative to the\naverage income of this society; and, accordingly, it will make sense\nto define the poverty line in relation to (as some fraction of)\naverage income.\n\nOne idea that plays a particularly important role in discussions of\nthis issue is that of self-respect. People have an interest\nin (capability for) self-respect (on which, see Rawls 1971 [1999]:\n386\u2013391). But, so the argument runs, our self-respect depends on\nour being able to maintain a style of life that is sufficiently\nsimilar to that of our fellow citizens. We will perhaps look inferior,\nand start to feel inferior, if we do not wear the sort of clothes that\nour fellow citizens wear, participate in the social activities that\nthey do, and so on. If self-respect depends on relative consumption in\nthis way, and \u201ca minimally decent life\u201d is one that\nincludes our being able to enjoy self-respect, then the social minimum\nis properly seen as being relative to average income and the levels of\nconsumption that can be sustained on this level of income.\n\nOn the other hand, there is almost certainly a lower limit to this\nrelativity. If the average income level in a nation is very low\nindeed, then even people with high income in relation to this average\nmight well lack the resources needed to lead a minimally decent life.\nFor example, if people in a given nation cannot eat well enough to\navoid malnutrition on an income that is twice the national average,\nthen even some people who are relatively rich in this nation will\nstill be living below the level of the social minimum. For this\nreason, it also seems essential to hold to an idea of an absolute\nglobal social minimum alongside that of nationally-specific\nminima.\n",
