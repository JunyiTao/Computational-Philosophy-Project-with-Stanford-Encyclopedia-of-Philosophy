    "main_text": "\n\nShould political leaders violate the deepest constraints of morality\nin order to achieve great goods or avoid disasters for their\ncommunities? This question poses what has become known amongst\nphilosophers as the problem of dirty hands. There are many different\nstrands to the philosophical debate about this topic, and they echo\nmany of the complexities in more popular thinking about politics and\nmorality. All, however, involve the idea that correct political action\nmust sometimes conflict with profound moral norms. This entry seeks to\nunravel these strands and clarify the central normative issues about\npolitics that the cry of \u2018dirty hands\u2019 evokes. Beginning\nwith an illustrative passage from a renowned 19th century\nEnglish novel, the essay traces the dirty hands tradition back to\nMachiavelli, though its present vogue is owed mostly to the writings\nof the distinguished American political theorist, Michael Walzer.\nWalzer\u2019s views are explored in the light of earlier theorists\nsuch as Machiavelli and Max Weber and certain vacillations in his\nintellectual posture are briefly discussed. This leads to the posing\nof five issues with which the entry is principally concerned. First,\nis the dirty hands problem simply confused and its formulation the\nmerest contradiction? Second, does the overriding of moral constraints\ntake place within morality or somehow beyond it? Third, can the cry of\ndirty hands be restricted wholly or principally to politics or does it\nspeak equally to other areas of life, and, where politics is\nconcerned, do only the principal agents get dirty hands or do their\ncitizens share in the taint? This is the problem of scope. Fourth, how\nare the circumstances that call for dirty hands best described? Fifth,\nthe dirty hands problem has affinities with the problem raised by\nmoral dilemmas, but the question is: should those similarities be\nallowed to obscure significant differences?\n\nIn the course of addressing these issues, the dirty hands challenge is\nalso distinguished from that of political realism, with which it has\nsome affinities, and the resort to role morality to render dirty hands\ncoherent is discussed, as is the issue of the desirability of shaming\nor punishing dirty hands agents. The relevance of \u201cthreshold\ndeontology\u201d is explored, and it is suggested that much of the\npoint of invoking dirty hands comes from an ambiguous attitude to\nabsolute moral prohibitions, combining a rejection of them with a\ncertain wistful attachment to their flavour.\n",
