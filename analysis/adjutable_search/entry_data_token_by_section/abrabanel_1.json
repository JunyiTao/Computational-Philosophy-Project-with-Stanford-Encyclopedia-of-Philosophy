    "main_text": "Life and Works || Life\n1.1 Life\n\n\nJudah Abrabanel was born in Lisbon, Portugal, sometime between 1460\nand 1470. He was the firstborn of Don Isaac Abrabanel\n(1437\u20131508), who was an important philosopher in his own right. \nIn addition to their intellectual skills, the Abrabanel family played\nan important role in international commerce, quickly becoming one of\nthe most prominent families in Lisbon.\n\n\nDespite the conservative tendencies in the thought of his father,\nDon Isaac insured that his children received educations that included\nboth Jewish and non-Jewish subjects. Rabbi Joseph ben Abraham ibn\nHayoun, the leading rabbinic figure in Lisbon, was responsible for\nteaching religious subjects (e.g., Bible, commentaries, and halakhic\nworks) to Judah and his brothers. As far as non-Jewish works and\nsubjects were concerned, Judah, like most elite Jews of the fifteenth\ncentury, would have been instructed in both the medieval Arabo-Judaic\ntradition (e.g., Maimonides, Averroes), in addition to humanistic\nstudies imported from\n Italy.[4]\n\n\nBy profession, Judah was a doctor, one who had a very good\nreputation and who served the royal court. In 1483, his father\nwas implicated in a political conspiracy against Joao II, the Duke of\nBraganza, and was forced to flee to Seville, in Spain, with his\nfamily. Shortly after his arrival, undoubtedly on account of his\nimpressive connections and diplomatic skills, Isaac was summoned to the\ncourt of Ferdinand and Isabella, where he was to become a financial\nadvisor to the royal family. Despite his favorable relationship\nwith them, Isaac was unable to influence them to rescind their famous\nedict of expulsion\u2014calling on all Jews who refused to convert\nto Christianity\u2014to depart from the Iberian\nPeninsula.\n\n\nJudah seems also to have been well connected at the Spanish court and\nwas one of the physicians who attended the royal family. After the\nedict of expulsion had been issued, Ferdinand and Isabella requested\nthat he remain in Spain. To do this, however, he still would have had\nto convert to Christianity. Yet, in order to try and keep Judah in\nSpain, a plot was hatched to kidnap his firstborn son, Isaac ben\nJudah. Judah, however, discovered the plot and sent his son, along\nwith his Christian nanny, on to Portugal, where he hoped to meet up\nwith them. Upon hearing that a relative of Isaac Abrabanel had\nre-entered Portugal, Joao II had the young boy seized and forcefully\nconverted to Christianity. It is uncertain whether or not Judah ever\nsaw or heard from his son again. In a moving poem, entitled\nTelunah \u2018al ha-zeman (\u201cThe Travails of\nTime\u201d), he writes:\n\n\n\n\nTime with his pointed shafts has hit my heart\n\n and split my guts, laid open my entrails,\n\n landed me a blow that will not heal\n\n knocked me down, left me in lasting pain\u2026\n\n He did not stop at whirling me around,\n\n exiling me while yet my days were green\n\n sending me stumbling, drunk, to roam the world\u2026\n\n He scattered everyone I care for northward,\n\n eastward, or to the west, so that\n\n I have no rest from constant thinking, planning\u2014\n\n and never a moment\u2019s peace, for all my\n plans.[5]\n\n\n\n\nLike many of those Jews who refused to convert, Judah and his\nimmediate family, including his father, made their way to Naples.\nThere, Ferdinand II of Aragon, the king of Naples, warmly welcomed the\nAbrabanel family, owing to its many contacts in international\ntrade. In 1495, however, the French took control of Naples, and Judah\nwas again forced to flee, first to Genoa, then to Barletta, and\nsubsequently to Venice. It seems that he also traveled around Tuscany,\nand there is some debate as to whether or not he actually met the\nfamous Florentine Humanist, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (it seems\nunlikely that he did).  In 1501, after the defeat of the French in\nNaples, he was invited back to be the personal physician of the\nViceroy of Naples, Fernandez de C\u00f3rdoba. Among all of these\nperegrinations, Judah found the time to write (but not publish) his\nmagnum opus, the Dialoghi d\u2019amore. He seems to\nhave died sometime after 1521. Other than these basic facts, we know\nvery little of the life of Judah Abrabanel.\n\n\nEspecially enigmatic are the last years of his life, between 1521 when\nhe was requested to give medical attention to Cardinal San Giorgio\nuntil 1535 when Mariano Lenzi published the Dialoghi\nposthumously in Rome. There is some evidence that Judah moved to Rome\nnear the end of his life; some suggest that he fell in with a\nChristian group of Neoplatonists. Indeed, the 1541 edition of the work\nmentions that Judah converted to Christianity (dipoi fatto\nchristiano). This, however, seems highly unlikely as (1) it is\nnot mentioned in the first edition, the one on which all subsequent\neditions and translations were based, and (2) there is no internal\nevidence in the Dialoghi to suggest this. In fact, one of the\ncharacters in the work implies the exact opposite, stating that\n\u201call of us believe in the sacred Mosaic law\u201d (noi\ntutti che crediamo la sacre legge\n mosaica).[6] \n It seems, then, that either a careless or over-zealous editor\ninserted the phrase \u201cdipoi fatto christiano\u201d into\na later edition of the Dialoghi.\n",
