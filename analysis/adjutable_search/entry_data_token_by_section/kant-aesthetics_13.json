    "main_text": "Teleology || Nature\u2019s Purposiveness for Our Cognitive Faculties\n3.2 Nature\u2019s Purposiveness for Our Cognitive Faculties\n\nKant claims in the Introductions to the Critique of Judgment\nthat it is an a priori principle of reflecting judgment that\nnature is \u201cpurposive for our cognitive faculties\u201d or\n\u201cpurposive for judgment\u201d. This principle is, in the\nterminology of the Critique of Pure Reason, regulative rather\nthan constitutive. We cannot assert that nature is, as a matter of\nobjective fact, purposive for our cognitive faculties, but it is a\ncondition of the exercise of reflecting judgment that we assume\nnature\u2019s purposiveness for our cognitive faculties. The\nassumption that nature is purposive for our cognitive faculties is\nnot, strictly speaking, part of teleology, since the purposiveness at\nissue is subjective, and teleological judgments are concerned only\nwith objective purposiveness (see, e.g., FI VII, 20:221). But it is\nnonetheless relevant to Kant\u2019s teleology, since our entitlement\nto ascribe objective purposiveness to natural things, in particular to\norganisms, derives from our more fundamental entitlement to regard\nnature as (subjectively) purposive for our cognitive faculties (FI VI,\n20:218; Introduction VIII, 5:193\u2013194).\n\nKant characterizes the principle of nature\u2019s purposiveness in a\nvariety of different ways which he seems to treat as interchangeable\neven though they do not, on the face of it, come to the same thing.\nThe variety of characterizations stems in part from the variety of\ndifferent tasks he seems to ascribe to reflecting judgment itself. In\naddition to being responsible for aesthetic judgments, and to\nsupplying the concept of purposiveness which is required for\nteleological judgments, reflecting judgment seems to be ascribed the\nfollowing cognitive tasks: the classification of natural things into a\nhierarchy of genera and species; the construction of explanatory\nscientific theories in which more specific natural laws are\nrepresented as falling under higher and more general laws; the\nrepresentation of nature as empirically lawlike\n\u00fcberhaupt; and the formation of empirical concepts\n\u00fcberhaupt. Because the principle of nature\u2019s\npurposiveness is, in effect, the principle that nature is amenable to\nthe activity of reflecting judgment itself, it seems to allow of being\nformulated in a corresponding variety of ways, that is, as a principle\nof nature\u2019s taxonomic systematicity, of its explanatory\nsystematicity, of its empirical lawlikeness, and of its empirical\nconceptualizability.\n\nKant\u2019s discussion of the principle of nature\u2019s\npurposiveness for our cognitive faculties, and his related earlier\ndiscussion (in the Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic of the\nCritique of Pure Reason) of the regulative principle of\nnature\u2019s systematicity, have, together, been seen as very\nimportant for the understanding of Kant\u2019s views on empirical\nscience. Moreover, to the extent that the principle is seen as\nrequired not only for the construction of systematic scientific\ntheories, but also for the recognition of nature\u2019s empirical\nlawlikeness or (even more fundamentally) for the possibility of any\nempirical concept-formation at all, it takes on great importance for\nan understanding of Kant\u2019s views on empirical cognition\ngenerally. However, Kant\u2019s discussion of the principle has been\nthought to pose a number of serious interpretative and philosophical\ndifficulties, including the following:\n\nHow are the various formulations of the principle related? Kant\nseems to regard them as amounting to the same, and thus to be\ncommitted to the view that if nature is empirically conceptualizable\nat all, we must also recognize the empirical regularities it manifests\nas lawlike, and the corresponding concepts and laws must fall under a\nsystematic hierarchy. But it is not clear how such a view is to be\njustified. It seems quite conceivable that natural things could be\nconceptualizable (say, under familiar concepts like dog or\ngranite) without those concepts in turn figuring in a\nsystematic hierarchy. Relatedly, it also seems conceivable that we\ncould apply such concepts to natural things without being able to\ndetect any lawlike connections among the corresponding properties, let\nalone connections which in turn allow of being incorporated into an\noverarching system of empirical laws.\nRegardless of how one understands the task of reflecting judgment,\nand the content of the corresponding principle, why is it a condition\nof the successful exercise of reflecting judgment that we assume that\nnature is suitable for reflecting judgment? Why can\u2019t we pursue\nour attempts, say, to arrive at a systematic hierarchy of natural\nconcepts and laws, without assuming in advance that nature will favour\nour efforts?\nIf the principle is indeed required, as Kant suggests it is, for\nthe empirical conceptualization of nature and for the recognition of\nnature as empirically lawlike, then it would seem to be a condition of\nthe possibility of experience. But then why is it regulative rather\nthan constitutive? Relatedly, how are we to reconcile the respective\nroles of the pure concepts of the understanding (in particular the\nconcept of causality) on the one hand, with the principle of\nnature\u2019s purposiveness for our cognitive faculties on the other?\nIf Kant has already shown, in the Analytic of the Critique of Pure\nReason, that nature is subject to causal laws, then why is there\nany need for a further principle to account for the recognition of\nnature as empirically lawlike?\n\n\nMuch of the discussion of these and related questions was stimulated\nby Buchdahl, who argues (1969a,b) that the principle of causality in\nthe Analytic of the Critique of Pure Reason is insufficient\nto account for nature\u2019s subordination to particular causal laws\nand that, in addition, a principle of systematicity is required to\naccount for nature\u2019s empirical lawlikeness. A similar view is\ndeveloped by Philip Kitcher (1986); for a somewhat revised view, see\nhis 1994. Guyer (1990b) follows McFarland (1970) in ascribing less\ncognitive significance to the principle of nature\u2019s\npurposiveness for our cognitive faculties, holding that it is required\nonly to provide us with rational motivation for attempts at\nsystematizing nature; see also Guyer (1990c, 1979 [1997: ch. 2], and\n2003c). Other influential discussions from the late 1980s and early\n1990s include Horstmann (1989), Brandt (1989), Butts (1990), Friedman\n(1992b and 1992a: ch. 5), Patricia Kitcher (1990: ch. 8; 1992), Walker\n(1990), and Brittan (1992). Friedman\u2019s view is notable in taking\na top-down approach to the systematicity of nature, on which empirical\nlaws of nature (such as the laws of chemistry) can be justified a\npriori through a top-down approach illustrated by Kant\u2019s\njustification of Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation in the\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science. Some of the\nliterature from this period, especially the views of Philip Kitcher\nand Buchdahl, is discussed in Ginsborg 2018a.\n\nA number of commentators have taken Kant\u2019s views on the\nprinciple of nature\u2019s purposiveness for our cognitive faculties\nto be fundamental for understanding Kant\u2019s views on the\npossibility of empirical knowledge. Floyd (1998) and Allison (2001:\nch. 1) claim that the principle represents Kant\u2019s answer to\nHume\u2019s problem of induction; Ginsborg (1990a: ch. 4; 1990b)\ntakes it to be a condition of empirical conceptualization and hence of\nall empirical judgment, not just of judgments based on inductive\ninference; Patricia Kitcher (1990: ch. 8; 1992) also argues for a\nclose connection between Kant\u2019s views on the systematicity of\nnature and empirical concept-formation. An even stronger view is\nsuggested by Abela (2006), who takes it to be required as a condition\nfor empirical truth, which he sees as required in turn for the\npossibility of any object-directed representation. Geiger (2009) also\nholds that the principle is required for all empirical cognition (see\nalso Geiger 2003), but argues that it is in the \u201cCritique of\nTeleological Judgment\u201d, and not in the Introductions to the\nCritique of Judgment (nor in the Appendix to the Dialectic of\nthe first Critique), that Kant offers his fullest argument\nfor its necessity. Other commentators who take the principle of\nnature\u2019s purposiveness to be a condition of empirical cognition\nin general include Teufel (2017).\n\nThe idea that the assumption of nature\u2019s purposiveness for our\ncognitive faculties is a condition of empirical concept-formation is\npotentially helpful in addressing the problem of the unity of the\nCritique of Judgment (see\n Section 1),\n given that the free play of imagination and understanding\ncharacteristic of judgments of beauty is often seen as closely related\nto the activity of imagination which allows us to categorize objects\nas having general features and falling into kinds. More generally, the\nquestion of how to relate the principle of nature\u2019s\npurposiveness for our cognitive faculties to the activity of the\ncognitive faculties in aesthetic judgment has been discussed by a\nnumber of commentators; see, for example, Ginsborg (1990b), Pippin\n(1996), Allison (2001: ch. 2), Guyer (2003b), Baz (2005), Caranti\n(2005), Hughes (2006; 2007: ch. 7), Gentry (2018) and Geiger\n(2020).\n",
