    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nLittle is known about Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s family and early\ntraining. He came from \u00c9taples, on the coast of Picardy, and by\nthe early 1490s he was teaching in the Coll\u00e8ge du Cardinal\nLemoine in Paris. In an unusually long teaching career of nearly two\ndecades, he became the college\u2019s most revered teacher, elevating\nit out of relative obscurity. His reputation as a philosopher was\ncultivated in the classroom and in countless editions of philosophical\nworks; any account of his thought must first place this diverse body\nof work within the context of his life.\n\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s early publications are punctuated by his three\njourneys to Italy. Colleagues mentioned his contact with the great\nhumanists of fifteenth-century Italy as much as they lauded his\nencyclopedic learning. He undertook these journeys, apparently, to\npursue models of scholarly inquiry which might leaven his teaching in\nParis. In 1491 he traveled to Venice, ostensibly to meet Ermolao\nBarbaro, who was famous as an eloquent translator of Themistius, the\nfourth-century paraphrast of Aristotle. (Barbaro was in Rome at the\ntime, so Lef\u00e8vre changed his travel plans to include Rome and\nFlorence.) On his return, he published his first work in print,\nTotius philosophiae naturalis paraphrases (1492). In these\n600 octavo pages, he presented students with short epitomes and\ndigested paraphrases of Aristotle\u2019s Physics, On the\nHeavens, the minor works of natural philosophy (i.e., Parva\nnaturalia or Little Naturals), and On the Soul.\nThe next few years were immensely productive, and with the help of\ncolleagues and students, Lef\u00e8vre published similar epitomes for\nthe standard university course on logic (1496b), Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics (1494a), and the Nicomachean Ethics\n(1494b).\n\nIn the 1490s, Lef\u00e8vre also published works for the university\nclass room which went beyond Aristotle, notably in mathematics\n(Oosterhoff 2018). For astronomy, he wrote an important commentary on\nthe standard introduction, John of Sacrobosco\u2019s Sphere\n(1495). In print, arguably Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s most original\ncontribution to any field was a systematic treatise on music theory\n(Elementa musicalia) which he published with three other\nworks: an edition of the Elementa arithmetica of Jordanus\nNemorarius (13th century), his own popular introduction to\nthe Arithmetica of Boethius, and an arithmetical game,\nRithmomachia (1496a; see also Oosterhoff 2013, Moyer 2012).\nThese mathematical works served pedagogical uses, first of all,\nhelping students through an often-neglected part of the Paris\ncursus. But they also served philosophical aims of\nLef\u00e8vre which became more evident in works unrelated to the\nuniversity curriculum. Consider three examples: in 1494 he published\nFicino\u2019s Latin translation of most of the Hermetic Corpus, along\nwith his own brief annotations; in 1498, he printed the first edition\nof the Works attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite, in Latin\ntranslation, along with an extensive commentary; and in the mid-1490s\nhe composed On Natural Magic (De magia naturali ),\nwhich circulated in manuscript (Lef\u00e8vre [MN]). Inspired partly\nby Ficino\u2019s Three Books on Life (De triplici\nvita), this treatise incorporated Pythagorean, cabbalistic, and\nPresocratic themes, for example in a section on \u201cPythagorean\nMagic\u201d (Copenhaver 1977; Mandosio 2013). His reflections on\nmagic especially included numerological excurses.\n\nBy 1500, Lef\u00e8vre had begun to produce more philologically\noriented editions\u2014typically he placed the newer translations\nalongside the traditional medieval versions, with his own commentary\nand occasional emendations informed by his modest command of Greek.\nThe earliest example of this method was his three-fold edition of\nAristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics (1497), which included\nthe medieval Latin version along with the translations of Johannes\nArgyropolus and Leonardo Bruni. This approach also defined\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s ground-breaking editions of the Psalms (1509),\nthe letters of St Paul (1512), and Euclid\u2019s Elements of\nGeometry (1517a).\n\nHe returned to Italy in 1500, meeting the famous humanist printer\nAldus Manutius in Venice and attending Roman celebrations of the papal\njubilee. At a monastery near Padua, he copied out some of Ramon\nLull\u2019s Blaquerna, and in Rome he found a treatise on a\nminiature astrolabe; he published both in Paris (1505 and 1500\nrespectively). On his return, perhaps stimulated by the Greek editions\nof Aldus, Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s Aristotelian program took on new\ndimensions, with fuller editions and translations than those of his\nearlier handbooks. The most significant of these was probably a large\nfolio Latin edition of Aristotle\u2019s Organon, with a full\nsuite of detailed commentaries. Another unusual publication combined\nAristotle\u2019s Politics and the pseudo-Aristotelian\nEconomics with 700 sentences taken from Plato\u2019s\nRepublic and Laws, digested as the\nHecatonomia (1506).\n\nAfter his final trip to Rome in 1507, Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s interest\nin philosophy receded into the background, as he retired from teaching\nat the Coll\u00e8ge du Cardinal Lemoine. Philosophy did not\ndisappear entirely, however. In 1514, he finally published the\nopera omnia of Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, the fruit of many\nyears spent gathering together manuscripts; and in 1515 he published\nArgyropoulos\u2019s translation of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics together with the translation of Cardinal\nBessarion, which Pico had given him in manuscript in 1491. But his\nprimary energies were now focused on biblical studies; and, as one of\nthe most prominent intellectuals of the day, Lef\u00e8vre was drawn\nreluctantly into several controversies. When the Paris faculty of\ntheology charged his friend Johann Reuchlin with Judaizing in 1514, he\nwrote a plea to Rome for help from the like-minded Giles of Viterbo,\nVicar General of the Augustinian Order. Then, Erasmus of Rotterdam\nsought to take the aging pedagogue down a notch by criticizing his\nwork on the Pauline epistles for shaky Greek. In 1517 Lef\u00e8vre\nfound himself at the heart of another academic culture war: the debate\nover the Three Maries, in which he took the skeptical view that the\nthree figures of that name in the New Testament were not, as tradition\nheld, the same person. The final, devastating controversy began in\n1521, when his patron, Cardinal Guillaume Bri\u00e7onnet, invited\nhim to lead an experiment in diocesan reform at Meaux, near Paris. The\nParis faculty of theology, already concerned about\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s incursions into the field of theology, found\nthe experiment smacked too much of Lutheranism\u2014which they had\nalready condemned in 1520. In a few years the experiment at Meaux\ndisintegrated, and in 1525 Lef\u00e8vre fled to Strassburg. The\nfollowing year Fran\u00e7ois Ier recalled Lef\u00e8vre\nto France. He tutored the royal children and served as chaplain at the\ncourt of Marguerite de Navarre, the king\u2019s sister, for the final\ndecade of his life (Reid 2009).\n",
