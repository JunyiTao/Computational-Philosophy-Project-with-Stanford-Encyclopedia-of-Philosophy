    "main_text": "14th Century Theories of Consequence || The British School\n4. Conclusion\n\nWe started by surveying the ancient background for the emergence of\nLatin medieval theories of consequence, in particular Aristotle\u2019s\nTopics and Prior Analytics, the commentaries by the\nancient commentators, and Boethius\u2019 influential logical texts.\nTheories of consequence only became an autonomous topic of\ninvestigation in the 14th century, but previous\ndevelopments, in particular Abelard\u2019s theory of inference/entailment\nand the increasing application of hylomorphism to logic in the\n13th century, are equally deserving of attention.\nNevertheless, the golden age for theories of consequence was\nthe 14th century, when different theories were proposed by\nBurley, Ockham, Buridan, Billingham, Strode, Paul of Venice, and many\nothers. As with much of scholastic logic, the topic of consequence\ncontinued to be explored in the 15th century and beyond\n(Ashworth 1974, chapter III), providing the background for much of\nwhat was to come in the history of logic, in particular the persistent\nassociation between logic and forms (MacFarlane 2000).\n",
