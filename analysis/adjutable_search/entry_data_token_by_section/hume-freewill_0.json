Free Will and Moral Sentiment \u2013 The Naturalistic Reading\nWhat we need to ask now is to what extent the classical interpretation serves to capture the essentials of Hume\u2019s position on this subject? From the perspective of the alternative naturalistic reading there are two fundamental flaws in the classical reading:\n\n\nFirst, and foremost, the classical reading fails to provide any proper account of the role of moral sentiment in Hume\u2019s understanding of (the nature and conditions) of moral responsibility. Part of the explanation for this is that the classical interpretation treats Hume\u2019s views on free will in isolation from other parts of his philosophical system. In particular, it fails to adequately integrate his discussion of free will with his theory of the passions (T 2.1 and 2.2). We are more vulnerable to this mistake if we rely too heavily on Hume\u2019s discussion \u201cOf liberty and necessity\u201d as presented in the Enquiry.\n\n\nSecond, and related to the first issue, the classical reading suggests an overly simple, if not crude, account of the relationship between freedom and moral responsibility. Whereas the classical account suggests that responsibility may be analyzed directly in terms of free (or voluntary) action, the naturalistic interpretation suggests a very different picture of this relationship. It would not be correct, for example, to interpret Hume as endorsing what J.L. Mackie has called \u201cthe straight rule of responsibility\u201d: which is that \u201can agent is responsible for all and only his intentional actions\u201d (Mackie, 1977): 208; and also 221\u20132). This is, nevertheless, a view that the classical interpretation encourages.\n\n\nIn order to see where the classical interpretation goes wrong we need to begin with an examination of Hume\u2019s arguments in support of the claim that necessity is essential to morality and that \u201cindifference\u201d would make morality impossible (T 2.3.2.5\u20137/410\u20132).\nHume\u2019s claim that necessity is essential to morality runs parallel to his claim that necessity is also essential to social life (T 2.3.1.8\u201315/401\u201305). To live in society people must be able to infer the actions of others from their motives and characters. Similarly, unless we were able to infer character from action no one could be held responsible and morality would be impossible. To understand the basis of this claim we need to get a clearer picture of what it is to be held responsible on Hume\u2019s account \u2013 a picture that is very different from the forward-looking, utilitarian-oriented view suggested by the classical interpretation. Holding a person responsible is, for Hume, a matter of regarding a person as an object of the moral sentiments of approval and disapproval. Approval and disapproval are \u201cnothing but a fainter and more imperceptible love and hatred\u201d (T 3.3.5.1/614). They are, more specifically, calm forms of love and hatred, which are themselves indirect passions.\n\nIn order to understand the relevance of necessity for the conditions of holding a person responsible we we need to understand the workings of \u201cthe regular mechanism\u201d of the indirect passions (DP 6.19). In his discussion of love and hatred Hume says:\nOne of these suppositions, viz. that the cause of love and hatred must be related to a person or thinking being, in order to produce these passions, is not only probable, but too evident to be contested. Virtue and vice, when consider\u2019d in the abstract\u2026 excite no degree of love and hatred, esteem or contempt towards those, who have no relation to them. (T 2.2.1.7/331)\nOur virtues and vices are not the only causes of love and hatred. Wealth and property, family and social relations, bodily qualities and attributes may also generate love or hate (T 2.1.2.5; 2.1.7.1\u20135/279, 294f; DP 2.14\u201333). It is, nevertheless, our virtues and vices, understood as pleasurable or painful qualities of mind, that are \u201cthe most obvious causes of these passions\u201d (T 2.1.7.2/295; cp. 3.1.2.5/473; and also 3.3.1.3/574\u20135). In this way, by means of the general mechanism of the indirect passions, virtue and vice give rise to that \u201cfaint and imperceptible\u201d form of love and hatred which constitutes the moral sentiments. This is essential to all our ascriptions of moral responsibility.\nHume makes clear that it is not actions, as such, that give rise to our moral sentiments but rather our more enduring or persisting character traits (T 2.2.3.4/348\u20139; and also 3.3.1.4\u20135/575). The crucial passage in his discussion \u201cOf liberty and necessity\u201d is the following:\nActions are by their very nature temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some cause in the characters and disposition of the person, who perform\u2019d them, they infix not themselves upon him, and can neither redound to his honour, if good, nor infamy, if evil. The action itself may be blameable\u2026 But the person is not responsible for it; and as it proceeded from nothing in him, that is durable or constant, and leaves nothing of that nature behind it, \u2018tis impossible he can, upon its account, become the object of punishment or vengeance. (T 2.3.2.6/411; cp. EU 8.29/98; see also T 3.3.3.4/575: \u201cIf any action\u2026\u201d)\nFurther below, in Book II, Hume expands on these remarks:\n\u2018Tis evident, that when we praise any actions, we regard only the motives that produc\u2019d them, and consider the actions as signs or indications of certain principles in the mind and temper. The external performance has no merit. We must look within to find the moral quality. This we cannot do directly; and therefore fix our attention on actions, as on external signs. But these actions are still consider\u2019d as signs; and the ultimate object of our praise and approbation is the motive, that produc\u2019d them. (T 3.2.1.2/477; cp. 3.2.1.8/479; EU 8.31/99)\nIn these two passages Hume is making two distinct but related points. First, he maintains that \u201caction\u201d, considered as an \u201cexternal performance\u201d without any reference to the motive or intention that produced it, is not itself of moral concern. It is, rather, the \u201cinternal\u201d cause of the action that arouses our moral sentiments. It is these aspects of action that inform us about the mind and moral character of the agent. Second, the moral qualities of an agent that arouse our moral sentiments must be \u201cdurable or constant\u201d \u2013 they cannot be \u201ctemporary and perishing\u201d in nature in the way actions are. This second condition on the generation of moral sentiment is itself a particular instance of the more general observation that Hume has made earlier on in Book II that the relationship between the quality or feature that gives rise to the indirect passions (i.e., its cause) and the person who is the object of the passion must not be \u201ccasual or inconstant\u201d (T 2.1.6.7/293). It is, nevertheless, the first point that is especially important for our present purpose of understanding why necessity is essential to morality.\nIn order to know anyone\u2019s motives and character we require inference, from their actions to their motives and character (T 2.1.11.3; 3.3.1.7/317, 576). Without knowledge of anyone\u2019s character no sentiment of approbation or blame would be aroused in us. Without inferences moving in this direction \u2013 from action to character (as opposed to from character to actions) \u2013 no one would be an object of praise or blame and, hence, no one would be regarded as morally responsible. In these circumstances, praising and blaming would be psychologically impossible. Along the same lines, external violence, like liberty of indifference, also makes it impossible to regard someone as an object of praise or blame. When an action is produced by causes external to the agent we are led away from the agent\u2019s character. Clearly, then, actions that are either uncaused or caused by external factors cannot render an agent responsible, not because it would be unreasonable to hold the person responsible, but rather because it would be psychologically impossible to hold the person responsible, where this stance is understood in terms of the operation of the moral sentiments. It is in this way that Hume brings his observations concerning the operation of the indirect passions to bear on his claim that necessity is essential to morality and, in particular, to our attitudes and practices associated with responsibility and punishment.\nIn light of this alternative account, we may conclude that the nature of Hume\u2019s compatibilist strategy is significantly misrepresented by the classical interpretation. Hume\u2019s arguments purporting to show that necessity is essential to morality are intimately connected with his discussion of the indirect passions and the specific mechanism that generates the moral sentiments. Whereas the classical interpretation construes his arguments as conceptual or logical in nature, the naturalistic interpretation presents Hume as concerned to describe the circumstances under which people are felt to be responsible. Interpreted this way, Hume\u2019s arguments constitute a contribution to descriptive moral psychology and, as such, they are an important part of his wider program to \u201cintroduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral subjects\u201d (which is the subtitle of the Treatise).\n",
