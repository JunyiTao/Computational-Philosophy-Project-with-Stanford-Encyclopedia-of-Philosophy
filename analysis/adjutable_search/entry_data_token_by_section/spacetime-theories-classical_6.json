(Newton\u2019s\ncritique is studied in more detail in the entry\n Newton\u2019s views on space, time, and motion.)[4]\n\nThe most famous argument invokes the so-called \u2018Newton\u2019s\nbucket\u2019 experiment. Stripped to its basic elements one\ncompares:\n\na bucket of water hanging from a cord as the bucket is set\nspinning about the cord\u2019s axis, with\nthe same bucket and water when they are rotating at the same rate\nabout the cord\u2019s axis.\n\n\nAs is familiar from any rotating system, there will be a tendency for\nthe water to recede from the axis of rotation in the latter case: in\n(i) the surface of the water will be flat (because of the\nEarth\u2019s gravitational field) while in (ii) it will be concave.\nThe analysis of such \u2018inertial effects\u2019 due to rotation\nwas a major topic of enquiry of \u2018natural philosophers\u2019 of\nthe time, including Descartes and his followers, and they would\ncertainly have agreed with Newton that the concave surface of the\nwater in the second case demonstrated that the water was moving in a\nmechanically significant sense. There is thus an immediate problem for\nthe claim that proper motion is the correct mechanical sense of\nmotion: in (i) and (ii) proper motion is anti-correlated with\nthe mechanically significant motion revealed by the surface of the\nwater. That is, the water is flat in (i) when it is in motion relative\nto its immediate surroundings \u2013 the inner sides of the bucket\n\u2013 but curved in (ii) when it is at rest relative to its\nimmediate surroundings. Thus the mechanically relevant meaning of\nrotation is not that of proper motion. (You may have noticed a small\nlacuna in Newton\u2019s argument: in (i) the water is at rest and in\n(ii) in motion relative to that part of its surroundings constituted\nby the air above it. It\u2019s not hard to imagine small\nmodifications to the example to fill this gap.)\n\nNewton also points out that the height that the water climbs up the\ninside of the bucket provides a measure of the rate of rotation of\nbucket and water: the higher the water rises up the sides, the greater\nthe tendency to recede must be, and so the faster the water must be\nrotating in the mechanically significant sense. But suppose, very\nplausibly, that the measure is unique, that any particular height\nindicates a particular rate of rotation. Then the unique height that\nthe water reaches at any moment implies a unique rate of rotation in a\nmechanically significant sense. And thus motion in the sense of motion\nrelative to an arbitrary reference body is not the mechanical sense,\nsince that kind of rotation is not unique at all, but depends on the\nmotion of the reference body. And so Descartes\u2019 change of place\n(and for similar reasons, motion in the ordinary sense) is not the\nmechanically significant sense of motion.\n",
