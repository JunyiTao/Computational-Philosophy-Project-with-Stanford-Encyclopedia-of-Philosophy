    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Predestination and Free Will\n7. Ethics and Political Theory: Dominium\n\n\nAfter FitzRalph\u2019s death his fame and influence grew among those who\nwished to reform the Church. His anti-mendicant polemic meant that he\nwas often referred to in Middle-English Lollard literature. He was\nquoted extensively by Wycliff. His\nDefensio Curatorum was printed several times in the late\nfifteenth century and is the only work by an Irishman to be published\nas an incunabulum. John of Trevisa translated it into Middle\nEnglish. Printings of this work continued in the following two\ncenturies. Through the work of Ussher, Wadding and others, the\nmemory of FitzRalph was kept alive in the first half of the seventeenth\ncentury.\n\n\nOne topic in which FitzRalph was to have an influence was that of\nhis teaching on dominium, or lordship. In his dialogue De\npauperie Salvatoris (1356), FitzRalph argued that grace alone\nentitled a person to lordship over temporal things. Some centuries\nlater Lutherans thinkers, held that rights, and hence the authority of\nsecular rulers, were dependent on God\u2019s grace. Thus, if a\nruler was a heretic or a sinner his laws could not be binding in\nconscience \u2013 only a righteous ruler could be a just\nlegislator. An unrighteous ruler could be deposed; and such\n\u2018unrighteous\u2019 included unbelievers.\n\n\nThe Council of Constance met between 1414 and 1418 at which Wyclif and\nHus are condemned.  Wyclif\u2019s views on dominium are condemned but\nFitzRalph escapes censure.  The acts of the Council are made public\nand printed in 1500.  FitzRalph\u2019s Defensio Curatorum is\nprinted at Louvain in 1475 and his Summa de Questionibus Armenorum in\n1515.\n\n\nThe circulation of these newly printed works seems to have occasioned\na revival of interest in FitzRalph\u2019s ideas.  Firstly Jacques\nAlmain in his Question at Vespers of March 1512 (published in\n1518) engages with FitzRalph\u2019s views on natural dominion with\nregard to taking from another in times of necessity.\n\n \nIn his On the Civil Power, Francisco de Vitoria (ca.\n1485\u20131546) asked whether non-Christians have legitimate sovereigns in\nview of the Spanish discovery of the \u2018New World\u2019. He\nstates: \u2018Richard FitzRalph, archbishop of Armagh, a man of\notherwise blameless character and intelligence, certainly argues in his\nDe pauperitate Saluatoris that not merely unbelief but any\nmortal sin impedes any kind of power or dominion (dominium)\nor jurisdiction, either public or private; in the mistaken belief that\nthe true title and foundation of all power is grace.\u2019 Vitoria\nfought against the notion of dominium through grace since, as\na consequence, Christians would be entitled to take the lands, wealth\nand property from the native Americans, because Christians could and\nshould exercise dominium over all unbelievers and over the\nwhole world. This, of course, would render natural rights, or those\nwhich belong to human beings precisely because they are human, null\nand void. It was natural law theory which enabled de Vitoria to mount\nan impressive argument against this position. I think that if we\nconsider FitzRalph\u2019s intentions in developing his theory of\ndominion, he would have reacted strongly against the injustice\nperpetrated by later upholders of grace-based dominium. Whatever his\npolemical and sometimes extreme positions such as he writings against\nthe Franciscans, he had put forward a principle which was intended to\nbring some measure of justice into law and to deal with the\n\u2018sinfulness\u2019 of the Franciscan poverty-fiction and he\nwould never have ended up with defending laws without a principle of\njustice regarding first nation peoples in the Americas in the\nsixteenth century and later.\n",
