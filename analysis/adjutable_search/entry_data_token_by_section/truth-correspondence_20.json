    "main_text": "More Objections to the Correspondence Theory || The Big Fact\n9.2 No Independent Access to Reality\n\n\nThe objection that may well have been the most effective in causing\ndiscontent with the correspondence theory is based on an\nepistemological concern. In a nutshell, the objection is that a\ncorrespondence theory of truth must inevitably lead into skepticism\nabout the external world, because the required correspondence between\nour thoughts and reality is not ascertainable. Ever since\nBerkeley\u2019s attack on the representational theory of the mind,\nobjections of this sort have enjoyed considerable popularity. It is\ntypically pointed out that we cannot step outside our own minds to\ncompare our thoughts with mind-independent reality. Yet\u2014so the\nobjection continues\u2014on the correspondence theory of truth, this\nis precisely what we would have to do to gain knowledge. We would have\nto access reality as it is in itself, independently of our cognition,\nand determine whether our thoughts correspond to it. Since this is\nimpossible, since all our access to the world is mediated by our\ncognition, the correspondence theory makes knowledge impossible\n(cf. Kant 1800, intro vii). Assuming that the resulting skepticism is\nunacceptable, the correspondence theory has to be rejected, and some\nother account of truth, an epistemic (anti-realist) account of some\nsort, has to be put in its place (cf., e.g., Blanshard 1941.)\n\n\nThis type of objection brings up a host of issues in epistemology, the\nphilosophy of mind, and general metaphysics. All that can be done here\nis to hint at a few pertinent points (cf. Searle 1995, chap. 7; David\n2004, 6.7). The objection makes use of the following line of\nreasoning: \u201cIf truth is correspondence, then, since knowledge\nrequires truth, we have to know that our beliefs correspond to\nreality, if we are to know anything about reality\u201d. There are\ntwo assumptions implicit in this line of reasoning, both of them\ndebatable.\n\n\n(i) It is assumed that S knows x, only if S\nknows that\nx is true\u2014a requirement not underwritten by standard\ndefinitions of knowledge, which tell us that S knows\nx, only if x is true and S is justified in\nbelieving x. The assumption may rest on confusing requirements\nfor knowing x with requirements for knowing that one knows\nx.\n\n\n(ii) It is assumed that, if truth = F, then S knows\nthat x is true, only if S knows that x has\nF. This is highly implausible. By the same standard it\nwould follow that no one who does not know that water is\nH2O can know that the Nile contains water\u2014which would\nmean, of course, that until fairly recently nobody knew that the Nile\ncontained water (and that, until fairly recently, nobody\nknew that there were stars in the sky, whales in the sea, or that the\nsun gives light). Moreover, even if one does know that water is\nH2O, one\u2019s strategy for finding out whether the liquid in\none\u2019s glass is water does not have to involve chemical analysis: one\ncould simply taste it, or ask a reliable informant. Similarly, as far\nas knowing that x is true is concerned, the\ncorrespondence theory does not entail that we have to know that a\nbelief corresponds to a fact in order to know that it is true, or that\nour method of finding out whether a belief is true has to involve a\nstrategy of actually comparing a belief with a fact\u2014although the\ntheory does of course entail that one obtains knowledge only if\none obtains a belief that corresponds to a fact.\n\n\nMore generally, one might question whether the objection still has\nmuch bite once the metaphors of \u201caccessing\u201d and\n\u201ccomparing\u201d are spelled out with more attention to the\npsychological details of belief formation and to epistemological\nissues concerning the conditions under which beliefs are justified or\nwarranted. For example, it is quite unclear how the metaphor of\n\u201ccomparing\u201d applies to knowledge gained through perceptual\nbelief-formation. A perceptual belief that p may be true, and by\nhaving acquired that belief, one may have come to know that p, without\nhaving \u201ccompared\u201d (the content of) one\u2019s belief with\nanything.\n\n\nOne might also wonder whether its competitors actually enjoy any\nsignificant advantage over the correspondence theory, once they are\nheld to the standards set up by this sort of objection. For example,\nwhy should it be easier to find out whether one particular belief\ncoheres with all of one\u2019s other beliefs than it is to\nfind out whether a belief corresponds with a fact?\n\n\nIn one form or other, the \u201cNo independent access to\nreality\u201d-objection against correspondence theoretic approaches\nhas been one of the, if not the, main source and motivation for\nidealist and anti-realist stances in philosophy (cf. Stove\n1991). However, the connection between correspondence theories of\ntruth and the metaphysical realism vs. anti-realism (or idealism)\ndebate is less immediate than is often assumed. On the one hand,\ndeflationists and identity theorists can be, and typically are,\nmetaphysical realists while rejecting the correspondence theory. On\nthe other hand, advocates of a correspondence theory can, in\nprinciple, be metaphysical idealists (e.g. McTaggart 1921) or\nanti-realists, for one might advocate a correspondence theory while\nmaintaining, at the same time, (a) that all facts are\nconstituted by mind or (b) that what facts there are depends\nsomehow on what we believe or are capable of believing, or\n(c) that the correspondence relation between true\npropositions and facts depends somehow on what we believe or are\ncapable of believing (claiming that the correspondence relation\nbetween true beliefs or true sentences and facts depends on what we\nbelieve can hardly count as a commitment to anti-realism). Keeping\nthis point in mind, one can nevertheless acknowledge that advocacy of\na correspondence theory of truth comes much more naturally when\ncombined with a metaphysically realist stance and usually signals\ncommitment to such a stance.\n",
