    "main_text": "Decisional Privacy || Birth Control\n5.1 Birth Control\n\nBirth control and abortion are common practices the world over. Felt\nby many to be deeply private matters, birth control and abortion were\nonce criminalized on moral and medical grounds, but are safe and\nwidely available today. Laws categorically criminalizing contraception\nand abortion were struck down in the U.S., Canada, most of Europe,\nJapan and Taiwan by the final third of the 20th century. In\nthe United States, in 1965 the Supreme Court struck down laws\ncriminalizing birth control in Griswold v Connecticut, on the\nground that married couples have a \u201cright to privacy\u201d to\nuse birth control provided by physicians, grounded in the Bill of\nRights and the 14 Amendment. Several of the most effective forms of\ncontraception are only available through a medical doctor, including,\nin some countries oral contraceptives, interuterine devices, and\ntransdermal implants. \n\nFeminist philosophers have widely debated the significance of the use\nof the concepts of privacy and a \u201cright to privacy\u201d to win\nwomen the capacity to control their fertility (R\u00f6ssler 2004;\nBoling 1996). The concept of \u201cprivacy\u201d played a role in\nconfining women to traditional roles of daughter, wife and mother\nunder the authority of male heads of households. While Catherine\nMacKinnon argued that ascriptions of rights of privacy are merely\npalliative distractions from a more basic quest for gender equality,\nother feminists have argued that privacy rights play a proper role in\nachieving reproductive autonomy and pave the road to greater education\nand employment equality (Allen 2000; MacKinnon 1984).\n\nOfficial Roman Catholic doctrine opposes all non-natural birth\ncontrol, birth control devices and all intentional abortions (Pope\nPaul VI, 1968, Humanae Vitae). Some regard human sexuality as\nhaving an essentially reproductive purpose and artificial birth\ncontrol as unethically unnatural. Like Roman Catholics, other\nreligious faith communities subscribe to a belief that human life\nbegins \u201cat the moment of conception\u201d when a sperm\nfertilizes an egg, and that forms of birth control that may prevent\nthe development of a fertilized egg to grow into a baby are the moral\nequivalents of intentional \u201cabortion\u201d. Those who oppose\ncontraception on personal moral or religious grounds, sometimes but\nnot always, support a legal \u201cright to privacy\u201d ;\nprotecting access to medically safe birth control and/or abortion.\n",
