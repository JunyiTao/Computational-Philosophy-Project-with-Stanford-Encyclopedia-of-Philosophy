    "main_text": "Theological Fatalism: Pike\u2019s argument and God\u2019s omniscience || A Boethian solution\n5.4 A Boethian solution\n\nBoethius (c480\u2013524) offered a solution to the problem which in\neffect denied the supposition that God existed in 1900 or believed\nanything in 1900 (Boethius, The Consolation of Philosophy,\nBook V). God is, on this view, outside time; he is timelessly eternal.\nThomas Aquinas (1225\u201374) also offered this solution (Aquinas,\nSumma Theologica, Article 13). The idea behind the solution\nis, of course, that if God\u2019s knowledge is not temporal there is\nno reason why Jones should not have the power to bring it about that\nGod knows that he refrains from mowing the lawn on 1/1/2000 instead of\nknowing that he mows the lawn then, since possessing that power would\nnot require having the power to affect the past.\n\nThere may be a number of problems about whether a personal God could\nbe timeless, and how, if at all, he could relate to a temporal world,\nbut it is worth noting one particular problem. The problem is that,\nalthough this solution does not appeal to the possibility of affecting\nthe past, it may be vulnerable to some of the considerations which\nwould tell against that possibility. For suppose that we are unable to\naffect the past, and that the explanation for this inability is that,\nwhereas the future is not real, not actual, the past and present are\nreal and actual. Then it would seem that we would not be able to\naffect a timeless God\u2019s beliefs because, not being future, they\nwould be as real as any past beliefs (Adams 1987, 1135; Zagzebski\n1991, 61). Or suppose instead that the explanation for our inability\nto affect the past is that, if our action brings anything about, that\nin itself would constitute our action\u2019s being earlier than the\nthing brought about. Then it might seem that the idea that we could\nbring about a timeless belief would have to be dismissed; the very\nfact that a belief was brought about would make it later than whatever\nbrought it about, and so not timeless. (Though there would be some\nlogical space, perhaps, for a view that, whereas it was true of\ntemporal events that, if they were brought about, they must\nbe later than what brought them about, this was not true of events in\ngeneral.)\n\nOf course, such considerations need not be fatal to the Boethian\nsolution, because the view that the future is unreal, and the view\nthat the temporal order is determined by the causal order are both\ncontroversial. What it does seem to mean, though, is that there is\nless room than one might have supposed for the success of the solution\nif it is impossible to affect the past.(Rice 2006)\n\nIt is worth noticing a further potential awkwardness for the Boethian\nsolution. If it is really impossible to affect the past, then, even if\nthe Boethian solution would mean that God could know that Jones would\nmow the lawn on 1/1/2000 without compromising Jones\u2019s power to\nrefrain, he could not, on the basis of this knowledge, bring about\nevents in the world before 1/1/2000, which he would not have brought\nabout if Jones had refrained; for if he did, this would mean that\nJones had the power so to act that things would have been different\nbefore 1/1/2000; that is, he would have had the power to affect the\npast.\n",
