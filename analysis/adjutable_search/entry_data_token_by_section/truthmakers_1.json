    "main_text": "What is a Truth-maker? || Truth-making as Entailment\n1.1 Truth-making as Entailment\n\nOne influential proposal for making an elucidatory advance upon\n(Virtue-T) appeals to the notion of entailment (Fox\n1987: 189; Bigelow 1988: 125\u20137):\n\n(Entailment-T)\n a truth-maker is a thing the very existence of which entails that\nsomething is true.\n\n\nSo x is a truth-maker for a truth p iff x\nexists and another representation that says x exists entails\nthe representation that p. It is an attraction of this\nprinciple that the key notion it deploys, namely entailment, is\nubiquitous, unavoidable and enjoys a rich life outside\nphilosophy\u2014both in ordinary life and in scientific and\nmathematical practice.\n\nUnfortunately this account threatens to over-generate truth-makers for\nnecessary truths\u2014at least if the notion of entailment it employs\nis classical. It\u2019s a feature of this notion that anything\nwhatsoever entails a necessary truth p. It follows as a\nspecial case of this that any claim that a given object exists must\nentail p too. So it also follows\u2014if\n(Entailment-T) is granted\u2014that any object makes any\nnecessary truth true. But this runs counter to the belief that, e.g.,\nthe leftovers in your refrigerator aren\u2019t truth-makers for the\nrepresentation that 2+2=4. Even worse, Restall has shown how to\nplausibly reason from (Entailment-T) to \u201ctruth-maker\nmonism\u201d: the doctrine that every truth-maker makes every truth\ntrue (whether necessary or contingent). Every claim of the form\np \u2228 ~p is a necessary truth. So every existing\nthing s is a truth-maker for each instance of this form (see\npreceding paragraph). Now let p be some arbitrary truth\n(grass is green) and s any truth-maker for p \u2228\n~p (a particular ice floe in the Antarctic ocean). Now it is\nintuitively plausible that something makes a disjunction true\neither by making one disjunct true or by making the\nother disjunct true (Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984: 316). This is\nwhat Restall calls \u201cthe disjunction thesis\u201d. It follows\nfrom this thesis that either s makes p true or\ns makes ~p true. Given that p is true,\nneither s nor anything else makes it true that ~p.\nSo s (the ice floe) must make it true that p (grass\nis green)! But since s and p were chosen arbitrarily\nit follows that all truth-makers are on a par, making true every truth\n(Restall 1996: 333\u20134).\n\nThe unacceptability of these results indicates that insofar as we have\nan intuitive grip upon the concept of a truth-maker it is constrained\nby the requirement that a truth-maker for a truth must be relevant to\nor about what it represents as being the case. For example, the truths\nof pure arithmetic are not about what\u2019s at the back of your\nrefrigerator; what\u2019s there isn\u2019t relevant to their being\ntrue. So we\u2019re constrained to judge that what\u2019s there\ncannot be truth-makers for them. This suggests that operating at the\nback of our minds when we issue these snap judgements there must be\nsomething like the principle:\n\n(Relevance) \nwhat makes something true must\u2014in some\nsense\u2014be what it is \u201cabout\u201d.\n\n\nOf course the notions of \u201cabout\u201d and\n\u201crelevance\u201d are notoriously difficult to pin down (Goodman\n1961). And a speaker can know something is true without knowing\neverything about what makes it true. Often it will require empirical\nresearch to settle what makes a statement true. Moreover, what is\ndetermined a posteriori to be a truth-maker may exhibit a\ncomplexity quite different from that of the statement it makes true\n(Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984: 299). Nevertheless, it is clear\nthat unless (Entailment-T) is constrained in some way it will\ngenerate truth-makers that are unwanted because their presence\nconflicts with (Relevance).\n\nOne way to restore accord between them would be to abandon the\nDisjunction Thesis that together with (Entailment-T) led us\ndown the path to Truth-maker Monism. Indeed isn\u2019t the\nDisjunction Thesis dubious anyway? Consider examples involving the\nopen future. Can\u2019t we imagine a situation arising that makes it\ntrue that one or other of the horses competing in a race will win, but\nwhich neither makes it true that one of the horses in particular will\nwin nor makes it true that another will (Read 2000; Restall 2009)? For\nfurther discussion of issues surrounding truthmaking entailment, the\nDisjunctive Thesis and the Conjunctive Thesis, i.e. the principle that\na truthmaker for a conjunction is a truthmaker for its conjuncts, see\nRodriguez-Pereyra 2006a, 2009, Jago 2009, Lopez de Sa (2009) and\nTalasiewicz (et al) (2012). \n\nBut even if the Disjunction Thesis is given up still this leaves in\nplace the embarrassing consequence of defining what it is to be a\ntruth-maker in terms of classical entailment, viz. that\nany existing thing turns out to be a truth-maker for\nany necessary truth. Some more radical overhaul of\n(Entailment-T) is needed to avoid over-generation. One\npossibility is to redefine what is to be a truth-maker in terms of a\nmore restrictive notion of \u201crelevant entailment\u201d (in the\ntradition of Anderson & Belnap) that requires what is entailed to\nbe relevant to what it is entailed by (Restall 1996, 2000; Armstrong\n2004: 10\u201312). Whether exploring this avenue will take us very\nfar remains a matter of dispute. Simons, for example, reflects, \n\n\nIn truth however I suspect our intuitions about truth-makers may be at\nleast as robust as our intuitions about what is good for a logical\nsystem of implication, and I would not at present attempt to explicate\ntruth-making via the arrow of the relevance logic system\nR. (2008: 13)\n\n\nNevertheless since truth-making concerns the bestowal of truth,\nentailment its preservation, there must at some level be an\nimportant connection to be made out between truth-making and\nentailment; the effort expended to make out such a connection will be\neffort spent to the advantage of metaphysicians and logicians alike.\nBut even granted this is so there are reasons to be doubtful that any\noverhaul of (Entailment-T), however radical, will capture\nwhat it is to be a truth-maker. One vital motivation for believing in\ntruth-makers is this. Positing truth-makers enables us to make sense\nof the fact that the truth of something depends on how things stand\nwith an independently given reality. This is how Bigelow reports what\nhappens to him when he stops believing in truth-makers: \n\n\nI find I have no adequate anchor to hold me from drifting onto the\nshoals of some sort of pragmatism or idealism. And that is altogether\nuncongenial to me; I am a congenital realist. (1988: 123) \n\n\nTruth-makers are posited to provide the point of semantic contact\nwhereby true representations touch upon an independent reality, upon\nsomething non-representational. Since entailment is a relation between\nrepresentations it follows that the notion of a truth-maker cannot be\nfully explicated in terms of the relation of\nentailment\u2014regardless of whether representations are best\nunderstood as sentences or propositions or some other candidate\ntruth-bearer (Heil 2000: 233\u20134; 2003: 62\u20135; Merricks 2007:\n12\u201313). Ultimately (Entailment-T), or a relevance logic\nversion if it, will leave us wanting an account of what makes a\nrepresentation of the existence of a truth-maker\u2014whatever it\nentails\u2014itself beholden to an independent reality.\n",
