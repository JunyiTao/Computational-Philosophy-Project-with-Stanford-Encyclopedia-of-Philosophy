    "main_text": "\n\nThe concept of retributive justice has been used in a variety of ways,\nbut it is best understood as that form of justice committed to the\nfollowing three principles: \n\n that those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts,\nparadigmatically serious crimes, morally deserve to suffer a\nproportionate punishment; \n that it is intrinsically morally good\u2014good without\nreference to any other goods that might arise\u2014if some legitimate\npunisher gives them the punishment they deserve; and \n that it is morally impermissible intentionally to punish the\ninnocent or to inflict disproportionately large punishments on\nwrongdoers.\n\n\nThe idea of retributive justice has played a dominant role in\ntheorizing about punishment over the past few decades, but many\nfeatures of it\u2014especially the notions of desert and\nproportionality, the normative status of suffering, and the ultimate\njustification for retribution\u2014remain contested and\nproblematic.\n",
