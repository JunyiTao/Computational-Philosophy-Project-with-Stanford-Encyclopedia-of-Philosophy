    "main_text": "Theology: the Doctrine of Divine Ideas\n6. Theology: the Doctrine of Divine Ideas\n\nPaul deals with the problem of divine ideas in his commentary on book\nVII of the Metaphysics (tr. 3, chap. 2) and at the end of the\nQuaestio de universalibus (tenth conclusion: universalia\nplatonica et idealia sunt ex natura rei in mente divina causaliter\nponenda). The cornerstone of his theory of divine exemplarism is\nthe conviction that there is a close parallelism between human\nartificers as producers of artifacts and God as a creator\u2014only\nin this way, according to Paul, can the main goal of every theory of\ndivine ideas (that is, the explanation of the rationality of creation\nas a free act of God) be achieved. Paul develops four rational pieces\nof evidence for supporting the thesis of the eternal existence in\nGod\u2019s mind of a multiplicity of ideas, conceived of as the\nformal patterns and principles (exemplaria) of creatures.\n\nThe first argument goes as follows: since the prima causa\nproduces individuals which differ in species (type) from each other\n(say men and horses), they are produced according to different formal\nprinciples, as the effects of the same principle are identical in\ntype. The second is that if A and B are two different\ncreatures (say a man and a donkey) that God is going to create, their\nmutual differences cannot be grounded on their own beings, since they\nare not yet existing things; therefore they have to be found in\nsomething pertaining to God\u2019s productive potency, which will act\naccording to different principles present in it. The third argument is\nunsound: Paul argues that since in God each generic principle\n(ratio generis) is different from any corresponding specific\nprinciple (ratio speciei), therefore specific principles too\nare different from each other. Unfortunately, the proof he makes use\nof for showing the difference in reality between generic and specific\nprinciples is inconsistent. He affirms that if the generic and\nspecific principles were not distinct, then God could not create\nsomething according to the generic principle without creating it\naccording to a correlated specific principle\u2014while this is just\nwhat happens, since no animal can be created which is not an animal of\na certain species or type (a man, or a monkey, or a mouse). The fourth\nargument is that, since God knows that animal is the genus of man and\nthat being-an-animal is included in the definition of man, He thinks\nof them by means of two different principles; otherwise He could not\ndistinguish them (QdU, fols. 133vb\u2013134ra).\n\nIn the commentary on the Metaphysics, the Italian master,\nafter denying that the ideas are self-subsistent entities, as Plato\nthought, maintains that the meaning of the term \u2018idea\u2019 is\ntwofold: (i) broadly speaking (communiter), an idea is a\nspecific essence or nature (quidditas specifica), existing in\na mind as a causal model for the production of something; (ii)\nproperly speaking (proprie), an idea is a specific essence\nexisting in God\u2019s mind as a causal model for the production of\nsomething (In Metaph., book VII, tr. 3, chap. 2, fol. 298va).\nFrom these definitions, which he considers consonant with the teaching\nof Aristotle and Averroes, Paul derives four consequences or theses,\nwhich, taken together, represent the very core of his theory of divine\nideas:\n\nIdeas are ideas of specific essences and not ideas of genera or of\nindividuals, because ideas are formal principles, and they are acts or\nforms in relation to any other thing; on the contrary, both genera and\nindividuals are as matter in relation to species.\nIdeas are present in the mind as in a substrate, or subject, since\nideas are the tools of the mind, and the mind can only use tools\nclosely connected with and existentially dependent on it.\nIdeas are efficient causes (causae effectivae) in\nrelation to their effects.\nIdeas are models (exemplaria) in relation to their\neffects, since their effects are similar to them. This entails that\nideas are both direct objects of knowledge (obiecta cognita\nabsolute) and that by means of which the mind knows something\nelse (obiecta cognita respective), just as the phantasm is a\ndirect object for our knowledge and that by means of which we know the\nindividual from which it has been drawn. As a consequence\u2014Paul\nadds\u2014an idea is not the notion of something (cognitio\nrei), but the essence of a thing (quidditas rei)\nconsidered according to its intelligible being in a mind (In\nMetaph., book VII, tr. 3, chap. 2, fol. 298vb; see also\nQdU, fol. 134vb).\n\n\nIn sum, according to Paul, divine ideas play a threefold role in\nrelation to God and creatures: they are (i) the specific essences of\nindividual things themselves, considered according to their\nintelligible being in the mind of God; (ii) God\u2019s principles of\ncognition of creatures; and (iii) the eternal models of creatures. If\nwe also take into account that in his opinion (i) divine ideas are\nreally the same as the divine essence and formally distinct from it,\nand (ii) this distinction originates from their being efficient\n(co-)causes in relation to the different kinds of creatures, we can\neasily realize how close his position was to Wyclif\u2019s, which was\nconsidered heretical because of its consequences: metaphysical and\ntheological necessitarianism; restriction of divine omnipotence;\ndenial of the process of transubstantiation in the Eucharist. In order\nto avoid this form of necessitarianism, Paul, both in the commentary\non the Metaphysics and in the Quaestio de\nuniversalibus, maintains that in God there is an infinite number\nof ideas, some of which only have been brought into existence by Him.\nIn fact, there is a formal difference between the supreme principle of\nunderstanding of possibles, which is the divine essence itself as\ninfinitely imitable ad extra, and divine ideas, which are the\npractical principles of the production of creatures (In\nMetaph., book VII, tr. 3, chap. 2, fol. 298va; see also\nQdU, fol. 135rb). But he admits that we should conclude that\nideas in God are finite in number, if we considered the problem\nexclusively from the point of view of natural philosophy\n(ibidem).\n\nThe differences between Paul\u2019s doctrine and that of Thomas\nAquinas, his main source, on the one hand, and Wyclif\u2019s, on the\nother hand, are evident. Paul agrees with Wyclif against Thomas that\ndivine ideas are the specific essences of individual creatures,\nconsidered according to their intelligible being in the mind of God,\nand efficient (co-)causes in relation to the different kinds of\ncreatures, while he agrees with Thomas against Wyclif that there is a\ndistinction between being a mere principle of understanding\n(ratio) and being an effective model of production\n(exemplar). If Paul did not accept such a distinction, his\ntheory would be substantially the same as Wyclif\u2019s. On the\ncontrary, not only does he accept this Thomistic distinction, but he\ndevelops it in an autonomous way, which makes his admission of the\nexistence of an infinite number of ideas in God superfluous. According\nto Thomas, divine rationes and divine exemplaria are\ntwo different types of ideas, the former linked to pure speculative\nknowledge only, the latter linked to practical knowledge. Only\nexemplaria are ideas in the strict sense of the term.\nPaul\u2019s definition of divine ideas excludes that the (Thomistic)\ndivine rationes can be considered ideas, since a divine idea\nis the (i) specific nature (of a certain set of individuals) existing\nin God\u2019s mind, (ii) principle of actuality, and (iii) efficient\ncause in relation to creatures. Now, the Thomistic rationes\ndo not satisfy any of these requirements. Within Paul\u2019s system,\nwhat plays the role of the Thomistic rationes is the divine\nessence itself, which is the supreme principle of knowledge of\npossibles, but not an idea. Moreover, in Paul\u2019s view, divine\nideas are formally distinct from the divine essence. This means that,\nin principle, the divine essence and divine ideas are different\nentities. In fact, Paul\u2019s definition of formal distinction\ninverts the terms of the question in relation to the preceding\napproaches, as Paul is attempting to reduce multiplicity to unity (the\npassage is from many to one). What Paul wants to account for is the\nway in which many different entities of a certain kind (i.e. of an\nincomplete and dependent mode of existence) can constitute one and the\nsame substance. Hence, within Paul\u2019s theory of divine ideas the\ngap between the sphere of the possible and the sphere of the existent\nis deeper than in Thomas\u2019. The possible is grounded on God\nconsidered as a knower, while the existent is grounded on God\nconsidered as a maker; ideas play a role only in creation, while the\nsole divine essence is sufficient for allowing God to know possibles\n(see In Metaph., book XII, tr. 2, chap. 3, part 2, fols.\n466vb\u2013467ra).\n\nTherefore, Nicoletti\u2019s view can be summarized as follows: (i)\ndivine ideas are really identical with and formally different from the\ndivine essence; (ii) ideas are both direct, but secondary, objects of\ndivine intellection (the primary object being the divine essence\nitself) and that by means of which God knows every existent other than\nHimself; (iii) there are no ideas of individuals or of prime matter.\nPaul\u2019s position is more influenced by (Neo-)platonic\npresuppositions than that of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas appealed to a\nsort of non-real mode of existence of divine ideas, originating from\nthe relations of imitability holding between the divine essence and\npossible creatures, so that the existence of divine ideas is purely of\nreason. Paul of Venice tries the opposite way of hypostatizing\nideas\u2014his peculiar version of the formal distinction enables him\nto do so without compromising divine simplicity. He can therefore\nclaim that the divine essence is the substrate of divine ideas, as if\nthey were a sort of accidents inhering in a substance. As a\nconsequence, the statement that the ideas are direct but secondary\nobjects of divine intellection means that God\u2019s intellection\nfirst grasps the divine essence and then ideas, even though\nGod\u2019s intuition of Himself and God\u2019s intuition of ideas\nare not distinct. In fact, divine ideas are not the specific natures\nof creatures as creatures are conceived of terminative in\nthemselves by God, but as they are conceived of subiective in\nHim, that is, by means of a different reality (the divine essence) and\naccording to their relation of ontological dependence upon the divine\nessence itself. The identity between divine ideas and the esse\nideale proper to specific natures, and the relation of\none-to-many holding between specific natures and the individuals which\noriginate from them, explain how God can know individuals\nperfectly\u2014even though mediately, through ideas. In fact,\ninfinite individual causal principles derive from one and the same\ndivine idea, formally distinct from each other. They correspond to the\nthisnesses (haecceitates), which on the level of existence\ngive rise to individuals from species. As thisnesses are the formal\nprinciples in virtue of which individuals are what they are, something\nparticular, concrete, and perfectly determined in itself, so these\nindividual causal principles deriving from ideas are what causes the\npassage from the specific ideal standard to the analytical description\nof its instantiations (QdU, fol. 135ra). Prime matter, which\nis a necessary constituent of any corporeal thing, is known by God in\nthe same way as individuals are: not in itself, but derivatively in\nsomething else (ibidem, fol. 135rb).\n",
