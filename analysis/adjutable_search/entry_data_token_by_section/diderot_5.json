Major Themes of Diderot\u2019s Philosophy\n\nThere are different ways of dividing up Diderot\u2019s intellectual\ncareer, some which emphasize pure philosophical commitments, others\nfocusing on particular projects or strands of his thought, and still\nothers giving pride of place to politics. Of course, all of them\nacknowledge the central place of the Encyclop\u00e9die, not\njust because it was an enormous editorial project spanning many of the\n\u201cbest\u201d years of Diderot\u2019s productive life, but\nbecause it marked the invention of a new model of knowledge,\ncollaborative in the literal sense as a compendium of individually\nauthored articles, but also in the sense of joining disciplines,\nincluding the \u201carts and crafts\u201d, as newly equal purveyors\nof theoretical knowledge along with \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d.\nThe Encyclop\u00e9die is also an important resource if one\nis looking for Diderot\u2019s sources, as he authored many long\nentries on Epicureanism, Hobbes, Locke, Leibniz, or rather\nLeibnizianism, along with texts on eclecticism, skepticism and other\ndoctrines which reveal both his involvement with such ideas and the\nway he transforms them.\n",
