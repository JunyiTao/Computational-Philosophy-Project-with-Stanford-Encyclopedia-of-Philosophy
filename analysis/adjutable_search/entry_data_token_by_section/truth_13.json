    "main_text": "Correspondence revisited || Truthmakers\n3.4 Truthmakers\n\nThe truthmaker principle is often put as the schema:\n\nIf \\(\\phi\\), then there is an \\(x\\) such that necessarily, if\n\\(x\\) exists, then \\(\\phi\\).\n\n\n(Fox (1987) proposed putting the principle this way, rather than\nexplicitly in terms of truth.)\n\nThe truthmaker principle expresses the ontological aspect of\nthe neo-classical correspondence theory. Not merely must truth obtain\nin virtue of word-to-world relations, but there must be a thing that\nmakes each truth true. (For one view on this, see Merricks\n(2007).)\n\nThe neo-classical correspondence theory, and Armstrong, cast facts as\nthe appropriate truthmakers. However, it is a non-trivial step from\nthe truthmaker principle to the existence of facts. There are a number\nof proposals in the literature for how other sorts of objects could be\ntruthmakers; for instance, tropes (called \u2018moments\u2019, in\nMulligan et\u00a0al., 1984). Parsons (1999) argues that the truthmaker\nprinciple (presented in a somewhat different form) is compatible with\nthere being only concrete particulars.\n\nAs we saw in discussing the neo-classical correspondence theory,\ntruthmaker theories, and fact theories in particular, raise a number\nof issues. One which has been discussed at length, for instance, is\nwhether there are negative facts. Negative facts would be the\ntruthmakers for negated sentences. Russell (1956) notoriously\nexpresses ambivalence about whether there are negative facts.\nArmstrong (1997) rejects them, while Beall (2000) defends them. (For\nmore discussion of truthmakers, see Cameron (2018) and the papers in\nBeebee and Dodd (2005).)\n",
