    "main_text": "Psychology\n3. Psychology\n\nWith regard to psychology, Telesio took a materialist standpoint.\nAccording to his general rejection of the metaphysical (and therefore\ninappropriate) principles of matter and form, he rejected Aristotle\u2019s\ndefinition of the soul as forma corporis, i.e. as form and\nentelechy of an organic body (Aristotle, De anima II,1).\nAccording to Telesio, the soul is a separate being, but not in the\nsense of the Platonists, who define it as an immortal essence acting\nas the governor and mover of the body during its embodied life.\nTelesio held the soul to be a specific part of the body, defining it\nas the spiritus coursing through the nervous system and\nhaving its main seat in the brain. The spiritus which\novertakes the role of the anima of the philosophical\ntradition is produced by the white \u2018semen\u2019. Telesio calls\nit the spiritus e semine eductus. He maintains in DRN book V,\nch. I:\n\n\u201cThis [separate substance] will therefore be the\nspiritus, which took its origin from the semen, as we will\nexplain elsewhere (and it is to be found in all things made from\nsemen, namely those which are white and bloodless, with the exception\nof the bones and similar things); and only the spirit is what\nperceives in the animal, and moves sometimes with the whole body,\nsometimes with single parts thereof, and solely governs the whole\nanimal. That is to say, it performs those actions which, according to\nthe concurring opinion of all, are typical of the soul.\u201d (Vol.\nII, p. 208).\n\nTo ascribe psychic functions to a specific part of the body implies a\nrejection of the difference between organic and inorganic life, which\ndichotomy was central to the Aristotelian, Platonic and Christian\ntraditions. According to Telesio, there is a quantitative and not a\nqualitative difference here, which consists in the higher degree of\ncomplexity and the higher degree of warmth that some physical bodies\npossess. Whereas metals or stones are homogenous bodies, organic\nbodies consist of heterogeneous parts, including the bodily (though\ninvisible) spirit in the nerves and brain (DRN book V, ch. II). And\njust as there is no metaphysical difference between living and\nnon-living bodies, there also does not exist a qualitative difference\nbetween animals and humans\u2014in both, it is the same spirit which\ncoordinates the functions and operations of the different bodily\nparts. In DRN book V, ch. III Telesio states:\n\n\u2026and when it has been proved that in animals the spirit\nproduced from the semen is the substance of their soul, then one\ncannot doubt that the same exists in humans, albeit in a much more\nnoble form, and it is surely not of a very different nature and does\nnot possess highly different capabilities. We see that humans are\nformed by the same things as the other animals, and that they possess\nthe same abilities and even the same organs for feeding and\nreproduction, and that they produce a very similar semen and eject it\nin the same way and with the same pleasure and from a very similar\npart and become tired after ejaculation, and that the same things are\nbeing formed out of the semen in both cases, namely the same nervous\nand membranous systems. And it is only [the spirit] which in all\nanimate beings is perceiving and moving in the same way and according\nto the same dispositions. (Vol II, p. 216).\n\n\nIn order to explain how animate beings perform different functions and\noperations, traditional psychological as well as physiological\ntheories referred to a threefold soul. Whereas Aristotle in De\nanima had distinguished between the anima vegetativa,\nanima sensitiva and anima cogitativa (which\ndistinction also corresponds to that of plants, animals and humans\nwith their specific faculties), Plato had established three parts of\nthe soul (Republic 434d-443e), which in the Timaios\n(69aff.) he had associated with different organs, namely the rational\npart of the soul (logistikon) to the brain, the spirited\n(thumoeides) to the heart and the desirous or lower passions\n(\u00e9pithum\u00eatikon) to the liver. In this\ntripartition he was followed by the Stoic physician Galen (De\nplacitis Hippocratis et Platonis VII, I and III), who added a\nthreefold spirit\u2014the spiritus naturalis being produced\nin the liver, the spiritus vitalis refined in the blood and\nthe spiritus animalis distilled in the brain. Whereas the\nAristotelian psychology was combatted in the De rerum natura,\nTelesio dedicated a whole treatise to the criticism of Galen, the\nQuod animal universum ab unica animae substantia gubernatur.\nContra Galenum. According to Telesio, the functioning of an\norganic body cannot be explained by presupposing a plurality of\nrulers. In asserting the unity of the soul (i.e. spirit), Telesio\nfollowed the medical theorist Giovanni Argenterio (1513\u20131572),\nwho defended the unity of the spirit against the Aristotelian and\nmedical traditions.\n\nTelesio combined the medical theory of spirit with a basically Stoic\nnotion, that of the hegemonikon, according to which the\nspirit in the brain is responsible for all the states and operations\ntraditionally ascribed to the tripartite soul: \u201cthe animal\n\u2026 is governed by one substance residing in the brain\u201d\n(Quod animal universum ch. XXV; Var. lib. p. 254). Whereas in\nQuod animal universum he went on to explain the affects in\nterms of physiology, in De rerum natura he added a theory of\nsense perception and a theory of knowledge on physical grounds.\n",
