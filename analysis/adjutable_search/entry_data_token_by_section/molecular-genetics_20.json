They illustrate this point by reviewing\nthe current explanation of the first stages of anterior-posterior\npattern formation in Drosophila embryos. This explanation\naccounts for how a single-celled embryo with an intracellular gradient\nof bicoid protein (the concentration of bicoid decreases from the\nanterior to posterior end) develops into a multicellular embryo with\n14 parasegments (the first three parasegments later form the head, the\nnext three will form the thorax, and the remaining segments will form\nabdominal segments). Weber begins by explaining that the bicoid\ngradient is \"generated by the synthesis of protein from an mRNA\nspecies that is derived from the mother (by transcription of maternal\ngenes) and is deposited in the egg cell at the anterior end by\nmaternal nurse cells.\" (Weber 2005, p. 244). He continues by\nexplaining how the biocoid protein differentially activates a set of\nsix gap genes, which in turn differentially activate and\ndeactive eight pair-rule genes, which differentially activate\nand deactivate segment polarity genes and homeotic\nselector genes.\n\n The details of the cascades of gene activations and deactivations\nhave been investigated experimentally. Weber's and Rosenberg's\nsummaries of the results indicate that biologists can explain initial\npattern formation in terms of successive concentration gradients that\nregulate genes without essential appeal to information concepts. Weber\nbrings this point home by arguing in detail that the use of the term\n\u2018positional information\u2019 is metaphorical and that the\naction of the bicoid gradient can be explained without the concept of\ninformation. He concludes that this gradient and others do not carry\ninformation in an intentional sense; rather, they play causal roles in\nthe formation of new gradients through the regulation of genes.\n\n Rosenberg discusses problems confronting the idea that DNA contains a\ngenetic program for development. He starts with the question of\nwhether the account of the early stages of pattern development, which\nhe and Weber summarize (separately), can be elaborated to give the\n\"whole story of development\" (Rosenberg 2006, p.75). Will the whole\nstory be macromolecular? He also points out that the explanation of\npattern formation he describes is couched in terms of genes. He asks:\nwill this explanation survive if the gene concept does not? But in the\nend, he expresses optimism in the grand idea that the explanation of\ninitial pattern development can be elaborated to account for the\nentire process of development.\n\n Although both Rosenberg and Weber reject the idea that biologists'\nexplanation of the intitial stage of pattern formation makes essential\nreference to the idea that genes or DNA have intentional information,\nthey assume that the explanation makes essential reference or implies\nthe existence of a genetic program. But it is unclear why the use of\nthe term program is any less metaphorical than the term\npositional information. Rosenberg argues that we can infer\nthat DNA can execute programs from the fact that computers can be\nbuilt out of DNA and these DNA-based computers can execute programs in\nthe same sense that silicon-chip-based computers can execute\nprograms. Nevertheless, it is unclear what adding the phrase\n\"executing a genetic program\" adds to the explanation of intial\npattern formation. Weber and Rosenberg present their summaries of the\nexplanation in causal terms such as \u2018generate\u2019,\n\u2018deposit\u2019, \u2018activate\u2019, and\n\u2018deactive\u2019. One might ask whether the causal explanation\nsupersedes the metaphorical idea that DNA programs development.\n",
