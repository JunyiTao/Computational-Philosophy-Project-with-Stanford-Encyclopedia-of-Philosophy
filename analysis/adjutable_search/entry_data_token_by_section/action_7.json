Practical Knowledge\n\nWhereas the central notion in Davidson\u2019s theory of intentional\naction was that of causation, the central one in\nAnscombe\u2019s is that of practical knowledge. In a famous\npassage, she appears to define intentional action as an event that\nmanifests practical knowledge:\n\n[W]here (a) the description of an event is of a type to be formally\nthe description of an executed intention (b) the event is actually the\nexecution of an intention (by our criteria) then the account given by\nAquinas of the nature of practical knowledge holds: Practical\nknowledge is \u2018the cause of what it understands\u2019, unlike\n\u2018speculative\u2019 knowledge, which \u2018is derived from the\nobjects known\u2019. (Anscombe 1957, \u00a748)\n\n\nOnly recently practical knowledge has received sustained interest in\nphilosophy of action. Much of the resulting work aims to clarify and\ndefend Anscombe\u2019s view (Moran 2004; Thompson 2008, 2011; Haddock\n2011; R\u00f6dl 2011; Small 2012; Wolfson 2012; Marcus 2012;\nStathopoulos 2016; Campbell 2018; Marcus 2018; Frey 2019; Valaris\n2021); but several critics question her arguments, as well as\napplication of the notion to the definition of intentional action\n(e.g., Houlgate 1966; Grice 1971; Paul 2009b; 2011b). In response, a\nnumber of scholars who still find inspiration in Anscombe have sought\nto accommodate the criticisms by giving up on some of her most\nambitious claims. This section concentrates on contemporary debates\nabout practical knowledge stemming from Anscombe\u2019s discussion,\nbut we start by briefly examining its origins in ancient Greek and\nmediaeval philosophy.\n",
