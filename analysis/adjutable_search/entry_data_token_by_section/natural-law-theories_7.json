    "main_text": "Legal principles to remedy defective positive law || Adjudicating between exclusive and inclusive legal positivism\n3.1  Adjudicating between exclusive and inclusive legal positivism\n\n\nThe so-called positivist thesis that all law depends for its existence, validity\nand obligatoriness on its social-fact source(s) is often accompanied,\nas in Raz\u2019s \u201cexclusive legal positivism\u201d (Raz 1980,\n212\u201324; Raz 1985), by the thesis that judges, as the\n\u201cprimary law-applying institutions,\u201d have a duty (moral,\nif not also legal) to decide certain sorts of case (e.g., cases where\nthe existing legal rule would by work injustice) by\napplying moral principles or rules which warrant amending or\neven abandoning part of the existing law.  \u201cInclusive\u201d\nlegal positivists temper this by holding that the judicial duty and\nauthorization to depart from existing law by applying moral rules or\nprinciples is restricted to those classes of case where an existing\nsocial-fact sourced legal rule directs the court do so; the effect of\nsuch a directive, it is said, is to include within the legal system\nthe moral rules or principles (if any) thus pointed to.\n\n\nNatural law theory concurs with Raz and Gardner in rejecting the\ninclusivist restriction as ungrounded, but dissents from them in\nholding (as Dworkin does too: Dworkin 1978, 47) that any moral rule or\nprinciple which a court is bound to apply (or reasonably can apply), precisely as\na court, can reasonably be counted or acknowledged as a law, i.e., as a\nrule or principle which should be considered already part of our\nlaw. Against positivists generally, it holds that (i) little or\nnothing turns on whether or not moral principles binding on courts\nprecisely as courts should be called part of our law; but (ii) if\nsomething does turn on the name\u2014if, for example, it be\nrecalled that courts cannot \u201ctake judicial notice\u201d of any\nrule or principle not \u201cpart of our law\u201d (and so, as in\nrespect of rules of foreign law, have to hear evidence of the rule\u2019s\nexistence and content)\u2014it is sounder to say that judicially\napplicable moral rules and principles (unlike applicable foreign law)\nare ipso iure (i.e., precisely as morally and judicially\napplicable) rules of law. Such rules belong to the ius\ngentium portion of our law.\n\n\nDoes this amount to acknowledging that natural law theory is\nsignificantly less concerned than contemporary legal positivist\ntheories to establish the precise boundaries and content of the\nsocial-fact sourced (posited, purely positive) law of our community?\nNot really. For (i) contemporary legal positivist theories have\nabandoned the thesis of \u201cclassical\u201d legal positivists such\nas Bentham that judges and citizens alike should (as a matter of\npolitical-moral obligation) comply with the positive law of their\ncommunity: their treatises or essays on legal theory explicitly or\nimplicitly commend to judges as much as citizens the Hartian\n\u201cThis is law; but it is too iniquitous to be applied or\nobeyed\u201d (Hart 1961, 203; 1994, 208) rather than the Benthamite\n\u201cUnder a government of laws \u2026 obey punctually and \u2026\ncensure freely\u201d (Bentham 1776); so the concern of contemporary legal positivists to distinguish\nposited law from other standards for sound and legitimate adjudication\nturns out, in the last analysis (and despite appearances), to be\nmerely provisional. And on the other hand (ii) natural law theories\nhold as strongly as any positivist theory that sound and legitimate\nadjudication gives priority to a conscientious and craftsmanlike\nattention to social-fact sources and to rules and principles pedigreed\nby such sources, sets them aside only if and to the extent that they\nare \u201ctoo iniquitous to be applied\u201d, and tailors the\nresultant new rule so as to cohere as far as possible with all the\nother (not too iniquitous) doctrines, rules and principles of the\nparticular legal system in which the judge has jurisdiction.\n3.1.1  A test case: the Nuremberg question\n\n\nThe persons known as major German war criminals were tried in 1945 for\noffenses specified in an agreement (\u201cthe London Agreement and\nCharter of 8 August 1945\u201d) made between the states governing\nGermany since its surrender to them. The judges held that the\ndefendants had at all relevant times been bound by (and in many\ninstances had acted in violation of) the principles or rules specified\nin the London Charter, such obligations being derived not, of course,\nfrom the agreement (which was made subsequent to the acts in\nquestion), but rather, as to some of the crimes alleged, from\ninternational law and, as to the alleged \u201ccrimes against\nhumanity,\u201d from the \u201celementary dictates of\nhumanity.\u201d To hold the defendants responsible for violating\nthese rules and dictates, and reject any argument that their acts\u2019\ncompliance with German law could make them lawful acts, was not (so\nthe tribunal ruled) to violate the principle of law and justice that\nno one should be punished except for violation of law.\n\n\nThe result of these rulings might be accounted for (i) by exclusive\npositivism: the tribunal was morally authorized to apply moral rules,\nnotwithstanding that the rules so applied were not rules of law either\nat the time of the crimes or the time of the prosecution. But the\nterms of the rulings (as just summarized) can be accounted\nfor (ii) by inclusive positivism: the Charter was positive law for the\ntribunal and directed it to apply moral rules which by virtue of that\nlegal direction were also legal rules. Still, (iii) natural law\ntheory\u2019s account seems the most explanatory: the moral rules applied\nwere also rules of the \u201chigher law\u201d applicable in all\ntimes and places (and thus in Germany and its territories, before as\nafter the Charter) as a source of argumentation and judgment\n\u201caccording to law\u201d when the social-fact sources which are\nthe normally dominant and quasi-exclusive source of law are, in\njustice, inadequate and insufficient guides to fulfilling obligations\nsuch as the judicial obligation to do justice according to law, or\neveryone\u2019s obligation to behave with elementary humanity even when\nunder orders not to\u2014even if those orders have intra-systemic\nlegal validity according to the formal or social-fact criteria of some\nexisting legal system. And if one has doubts about victors\u2019 justice,\nthose very doubts can likewise appeal to principles of the same higher\nlaw, ius gentium, or law of reason and humanity.\n",
