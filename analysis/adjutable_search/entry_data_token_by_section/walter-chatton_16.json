    "main_text": "Future Contingents || God\u2019s knowing versus God\u2019s cognizing\n6.3 God\u2019s knowing versus God\u2019s cognizing\n\nChatton claims it can still be true that God knows \\(a\\) when \\(a\\) is\na future contingent object, provided we understand God\u2019s grasp\nof \\(a\\) as divine cognition:\n\n\u2026 [T]he larger proposition \u2018God knows that \\(a\\) will\nbe\u2019 is equivalent to this copulative sentence \u2013 \u2018God\nknows \\(a\\) and \\(a\\) will be\u2019. This I will concede, as long as\nthe \u2018knowing\u2019 referred to in the definiendum is taken to\nbe a cognition. (Reportatio I, 10\u201348, d. 38,\nparagraph 28, p. 352.)\n\n\nChatton explains his idea of divine cognition by recourse to an\nanalogy, a distinction, and a claim about all operations of the divine\nintellect.\n\nChatton\u2019s analogy is this: cognition is to knowledge as\napprehension is to assent or assertion. Just as apprehension\nimplies the mere grasp of something without additional judgment about\nit, so too cognition implies the mere grasp of something, without the\nadditional affirmative judgment implied in the term\n\u2018knowledge\u2019. Hence, when Chatton uses the phrase\n\u2018God knows \\(a\\)\u2019 in the above solution, it should be\nunderstood as \u2018God cognizes \\(a\\)\u2019, meaning that we are\nonly talking about God\u2019s grasp of \\(a\\), not about any\nkind of approval, disapproval, agreement, disagreement, etc.\n(Reportatio I, 10\u201348, d. 39, paragraph 14, p. 363). In\ncognizing, the divine intellect is somehow holding \\(a\\) without\nconfirming it, judging it, or creating it. Only one part of the divine\nintellect is in play, not divine assent or the divine will.\n\nAnother difference between knowledge and cognition is that\nknowledge is necessarily of a present existent, whereas cognition\ndoes not have this restriction (Reportatio I,\n10\u201348, d. 38, paragraph 42, p. 355). The upshot of the\ndistinction in this context is that God cannot know future\nobjects, for example, since they are not yet; however, he can\ncognize them.\n\nFinally (and this claim he intends to apply to both divine cognition\nand divine knowledge), God\u2019s knowledge and cognition are\nneither mediated by propositions nor are they generally of\npropositions (Reportatio I, 10\u201348, d. 39,\nparagraph 14, p. 363; Quodlibet, q. 1, paragraph 36). Chatton\nholds that God\u2019s intellectual activity is not discursive or\nrepresentative in any way, and that the usual objects of divine\nintellectual activity are not propositions, but rather real things,\nthat is, res. God does not require any mediator in the\noperation of his intellect with respect to creation; for example, he\nrequires no concepts or propositions in order to know or to cognize.\nRather, God directly cognizes (for example) the future contingent\nthings (res) that he cognizes, whether those things are\npeople, the shoes on their feet, or even occasionally and somewhat\ntrivially, the spoken, written, or mental propositions they talk,\nwrite, or think with. God sees them all through a kind of direct\nvision or intuition. As noted above, Chatton was a realist about\nrelations, and since relations are accidents inhering in their\nsubjects, for God to cognize a future res is also for him to\ncognize the relational accidents of that res. So, in\ncognizing a res, God cognizes everything about it, and so\ndirectly cognizes all the situations or states of affairs of this\nres as well, Thus, his grasp of it is complete. Because it\nhas no intermediary, God\u2019s cognition is not something separate\nfrom him; there is no determinate representation of a thing by\nwhich he cognizes. Consequently, divine cognition is, in a sense,\nnot really distinct from God himself.\n\nWith the idea of divine cognition thus developed, we can now return to\nthe problems we raised at the end of the last section. First, we\nasked: How can \u2018God knows \\(a\\)\u2019 be necessary when \\(a\\)\nis both future and contingent? After all, it seems the firmness of\nGod\u2019s knowledge of \\(a\\) and the determinacy of his concepts of\n\\(a\\) are a sign that \\(a\\) cannot be otherwise. But now we have our\nanswer. By \u2018God knows \\(a\\)\u2019 Chatton means only \u2018God\ncognizes \\(a\\)\u2019, and divine cognition is (1) non-judgmental and\nnon-voluntaristic, (2) not necessarily of determinate existents, and\n(3) a complete, though non-discursive, direct awareness. Consequently,\nwhen God cognizes some future \\(a\\), that cognition is in no way\njudgmental, confirming or otherwise approving of \\(a\\), nor does it\nentail the existence of \\(a\\), although it does grasp all that matters\nabout \\(a\\). In short, divine cognition is an omniscience that does\nnot interfere in any way with the natural operation or condition of\n\\(a\\), nor does it force \\(a\\) to exist, or imply it already does. The\ndivine will is out of the picture; mere cognition of \\(a\\) is not\ncausative of \\(a\\). Neither do we have to worry about the rigidity of\nsome structure called \u2018God\u2019s knowledge\u2019 and its\nrelation to \\(a\\). All divine intellection is direct, and so God does\nnot have a body of propositions about \\(a\\) or any intermediary\nconcepts of \\(a\\) by which he cognizes it.\n\nIn short, Chatton\u2019s view is that the necessity we detect in\n\u2018God knows \\(a\\)\u2019 attaches to God as a necessary\ncognizer, i.e., it attaches to the divine intellect alone, not to the\nobjects it cognizes or to some distinct, determinate body of truths\ncalled \u2018God\u2019s knowledge\u2019. It is almost as if, for\nChatton, \u2018God cognizes [future contingent] \\(a\\)\u2019 simply\nmeans, \u2018the all-seeing God exists and contingent \\(a\\) will\nexist\u2019.\n\nFrom these considerations we also get Chatton\u2019s answer to the\nsecond difficulty: Does God\u2019s knowledge of the world change when\nthe world changes? Chatton can formulate his answer with the same\nnotion of cognition. There is no change implied in God when contingent\n\\(a\\) comes into existence: (1) God\u2019s cognition has not changed,\ncertainly, since cognition is indifferent to existence, but (2)\nGod\u2019s knowledge has not changed either, at least not in any\nserious sense. For there are only three ways that God\u2019s\nknowledge could be said to change: (2a) it could be that the mental\nproposition \u2018Socrates is sitting\u2019 in God\u2019s intellect\ngoes from being false to true, say, when standing Socrates sits, i.e.,\nit literally changes truth value in God\u2019s mind; or (2b) it could\nbe that Socrates is now sitting and before he was not, and so before\nGod\u2019s knowledge contained the proposition \u2018Socrates is not\nsitting\u2019 but now it contains the proposition \u2018Socrates is\nsitting\u2019 instead; or similarly, (2c) it could be that Socrates\nis now sitting and before he was not, and so before God knew the\nnon-seated Socrates which was signified by \u2018Socrates is not\nsitting\u2019 but now he knows the seated Socrates signified by\n\u2018Socrates is sitting\u2019.\n\n(2a) and (2b) are not a problem because God\u2019s knowledge is not\ngenerally of propositions, nor is it mediated by them. And even when\nit is of propositions, there is nothing special about how he knows a\nproposition\u2019s shift from truth to falsity, as distinguished from\nany other form of change. (2c) is not a problem, because Chatton\nfamously held that the thing signified by \u2018Socrates is\nsitting\u2019, is exactly the same as the thing signified by\n\u2018Socrates is not\n sitting\u2019.[11]\n God cognizes of every proposition when it will be true; he cognizes\nthe \u201ctruth career\u201d of each proposition. But he cognizes\nthis at once, as of now. And when a proposition he cognizes becomes\ntrue, he knows it. But again, this is no change in God, who does not\nthink discursively, but rather sees every created thing, including\npropositions, as res.\n\nThere are still many questions we would like answered here, of course.\nFor example, what is the ontological status of the not-yet existing\nthings that God cognizes? Exactly what does God cognize when he\ncognizes a present non-existent? These issues require a more extensive\ntreatment than can be given here.\n",
