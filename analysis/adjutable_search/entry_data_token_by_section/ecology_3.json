Stochastic models in ecology are among the most\nmathematically complex models in science. Nevertheless they have begun\nto be systematically studied because of their relevance to biological\nconservation\u2014see the entry on \n conservation biology.\n They also raise philosophically interesting questions because they\nunderscore the extent to which the nature of randomness and\nuncertainty remains poorly explored in biological\n contexts.[18]\n\n\nWhat has, by and large, become the standard classification of\nstochasticity goes back to a 1978 dissertation by Shaffer. The context\nof that dissertation provides a striking exemplar of the social\ndetermination of science. The United States National Forest Management\nAct of 1976 required the Forest Service to \u201cprovide for\ndiversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and\ncapability of the specific land\n area.\u201d[19]\n In 1979 the planning regulations developed to implement this\nprovision required the Forest Service to \u201cmaintain viable\npopulations of existing native and desired non-native vertebrate\nspecies in the planning\n area.\u201d[20]\n A viable population was defined as \u201cone which has the estimated\nnumbers and distribution of reproductive individuals to insure its\ncontinued existence in the planning area.\u201d For large\npopulations, falling within the domain of deterministic models,\nestablishing viability is relatively trivial: all that must be ensured\nis that, on the average, a population is not declining in size. For\nsmall populations, even if it is increasing in size on the average, a\nchance fluctuation can result in extinction. Stochastic models are\nnecessary to predict parameters such as the probability of extinction\nwithin a specified time period or the expected time to extinction.\n\n\nIn his dissertation, Shaffer attempted such an analysis for the grizzly\nbears (Ursus arctos) of Yellowstone which were believed to\nface the prospect of stochastic extinction. Shaffer distinguished four\nsources of uncertainty that can contribute to random extinction:\n\ndemographic stochasticity which arises from the chance\nevents in the survival and reproductive success of a finite number of\nindividuals\u2026\nenvironmental stochasticity due to temporal\nvariation of birth and death rates, carrying capacity, and the\npopulation of competitors, predators, parasites, and\ndiseases\u2026\nnatural catastrophes such as floods, fires, droughts,\netc.\u2026\ngenetic stochasticity resulting from changes in gene\nfrequencies due to founder effect, random fixation,\nor\n inbreeding.\u201d[21]\n\n\n\nShaffer went on to argue that all these factors increase in importance\nas the population size decreases\u2014a claim that will be questioned\nbelow\u2014and, therefore, that their effects are hard to\ndistinguish. Finally, he defined a minimum viable population (MVP):\n\u201cA minimum viable population for any given species in any given\nhabitat is the smallest population having at least a 95% chance of\nremaining extant for 100 years despite the foreseeable effects of\ndemographic, environmental, and genetic stochasticity, and natural\n catastrophes.\u201d[22]\n Both numbers (95% and 100 years) are conventional, and to be\ndetermined by social choice, rather than by biological factors, a\npoint that Shaffer explicitly recognized.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, techniques to determine MVPs came to be called\n\u201cpopulation viability analysis\u201d and the enthusiasm for the\nnew framework was captured in the much-worn slogan: \u201cMVP is the\nproduct, PVA the\n process.\u201d[23]\n By the late 1980s, however, it became clear that the concept of a MVP\nwas at best of very limited use. Leaving aside the conventional\nelements of the definition given above, even for the same species,\npopulations in marginally different habitat patches often show highly\nvariable demographic trends resulting in highly variable MVP estimates\nfor them, with each estimate depending critically on the local\n context.[24]\n Moreover, as will be illustrated below for stochastic population\nmodels in general, the determination of MVPs suffers from irremediable\nstructural uncertainty. This should not come as a surprise: what would\nhave been more surprising is if legislative fiat had identified a\nscientifically valuable parameter. After the demise of the concept of\nthe MVP, PVA began to be performed largely to estimate other\nparameters, especially the expected time to extinction of a population\nthe estimation of which does not require any conventional\nchoices\u2014see the entry on \n conservation biology.\n\n\nWithin the context of PVA, Shaffer's classification\u2014though\nusually with \u201crandom catastrophe\u201d replacing \u201cnatural\ncatastrophe\u201d\u2014became canonical within both ecology and\nconservation\n biology.[25]\n However, the philosophical question remains as to whether it makes\nsense\u2014classification, as many philosophers have pointed out, is\nnot innocent of substantive theoretical assumptions. The first point\nto note is that genetic stochasticity is not even the same type of\nmechanism as the other three: its presence makes Shaffer's\nclassification oddly heterogeneous. The reason for this is that\ngenetic stochasticity is a consequence of demographic stochasticity:\nin small populations, a particular allele may reach fixation purely by\nchance reproductive events. It is even possible that stochasticity\nincreases the rate at which a beneficial allele may go to fixation in\na small population provided that the initial frequency of that allele\nis already high.\n\n\nLeaving genetic stochasticity aside, do the other three categories\nprovide a good classification of stochasticity, or is the\nclassification more like that of animals in Borges' notorious Chinese\n encyclopedia?[26]\n For any classification to be a good one, it must, at the very least\nsatisfy three criteria: (i) it must organize phenomena into a\nrelevantly homogeneous class of categories. Relevance is determined\ncontextually by the possibility of there being a coherent account of\nhow those categories came to be defined. Including genetic\nstochasticity in the classification leads to a lack of such\ncoherence\u2014hence, its exclusion above; (ii) the categories should\nbe jointly exhaustive, able to subsume all cases of the relevant\nphenomena; and (iii) the categories should be mutually exclusive, that\nis, no phenomenon should be subsumed under more than one category.\n\n\nIt is the third criterion that is often called into question by\nShaffer's classification of stochasticity primarily because of\nformalization indeterminacy. Consider some small reptile that fails to\nbreed because a flood creates a barrier across its habitat that it\ncannot cross and there are no available mates on its side of the\nbarrier. Is this environmental or demographic stochasticity? On the\none hand, it is obviously environmental because floods are precisely\nthe type of mechanism by which environmental stochasticity is\nexpressed. On the other hand, it is equally obviously demographic\nbecause the failure to reproduce is due to the chance unavailability\nof a mate on the appropriate side of the barrier. Ultimately, as will\nbe discussed below in some detail, whether this is a case of\ndemographic or environmental stochasticity depends on how it is\nmodeled. There is an important philosophical lesson here: especially\nwhen a new discipline is being formed, the structure of the\nphenomena\u2014how they are distinguished and classified\u2014are in\npart determined by the models used to represent them. Consequently,\nclassification is not theoretically innocent. This is as true in\necology as in any other scientific context.\n\n\nThus, as a prelude to modeling, Lande et al. argue that\ndemographic stochasticity \u201crefers to chance events of individual\nmortality and reproduction, which are usually conceived of as being\nindependent among individuals\u201d whereas environmental\nstochasticity \u201crefers to temporal fluctuations in the\nprobability of mortality and the reproductive rate of all individuals\nin a population in the same or similar fashion. The impact of\nenvironmental stochasticity is roughly the same for small and large\n populations.\u201d[27]\n This is further elaborated: \u201cRandom variation in the expected\nfitness that is independent of population density constitutes\nenvironmental stochasticity. Random variation in individual fitness,\ncoupled with sampling effects in a finite population, produces\ndemographic\n stochasticity.\u201d[28]\n Nevertheless, environmental fluctuations or even random catastrophes\naffect the size of a population only insofar as they affect\nreproduction and death rates, that is, by creating demographic\nfluctuations; at least in this sense, the second and third categories\nof stochasticity are not conceptually independent of the first.\nMoreover, Lande and others regard random catastrophes as extreme cases\nof environmental stochasticity. Consequently, it requires explicit\nmathematical models in which these distinctions are made exact through\nformal\n definitions.[29]\n Usually, models of demographic stochasticity are distinguished from\nmodels of environmental stochasticity using as a criterion whether the\nstochastic factor explicitly depends on the population size as a\nparameter. If it does, the model in question is one of demographic\nstochasticity; if it does not, it is one of environmental\nstochasticity. This choice captures the intuition mentioned earlier\nthat the effect of the former depends on the population size whereas\nthe effect of the latter does not.\n\n\nThe mathematical analysis of these models is non-trivial. The most\ngeneral and uncontroversial theoretical result to date is that\nprogressively larger populations are required for safety in the face\nof demographic, environmental, and random catastrophic stochasticity.\nMoreover, because of the structural uncertainly of these models,\napparently slight differences in assumptions and techniques routinely\nlead to widely divergent predictions. This can be illustrated using\nthe well-studied example of the Yellowstone grizzlies. In 1994 Foley\nconstructed a model for this population incorporating environmental\nstochasticity alone and depending on the intrinsic growth rate of the\npopulation and the carrying capacity of the\n environment.[30]\n The model's prediction augured well for the grizzlies: with a\nreasonable value for the carrying capacity and the measured value for\nthe intrinsic growth rate, the expected time to extinction was about\n12,000 years. In 1997 Foley constructed another model incorporating\nboth demographic and environmental stochasticity but with the option\nof setting either part equal to\n 0.[31]\n When this model is solved with the demographic stochasticity equal to\n0 (a case not analyzed by Foley), it should give the same result as\nthe 1994 model. It does not. It predicts a much lower expected time to\n extinction.[32]\n",
