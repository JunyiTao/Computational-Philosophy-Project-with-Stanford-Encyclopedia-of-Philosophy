Especially, they have criticized\nunderstanding biological explanation as similar to law-based accounts\nof explanations in physics (see Lange 2007). In contrast, scholars\nhave argued that explanation in the biosciences often includes\ndescribing a mechanism that brings about a certain biological\nphenomenon (Bechtel & Richardson 1993; Craver 2007; Bechtel &\nAbrahamsen 2010; see also entry\n mechanisms in science).\n Especially evo-devo has been described as a paradigmatic mechanistic\nscience, which \u2013 against the ultimate-proximate distinction\n\u2013 seeks to identify developmental mechanisms that can explain\nevolutionary change in phenotypes (Gilbert 2003; Hall 2012). This\nmechanistic approach is often flanked by mathematical models of\nvarious developmental patterns, from changes in gene regulatory\nnetworks to growth patterns of organisms, and by historical narratives\non how organisms and species evolve (Jaeger & Sharpe 2014; Winther\n2015). However, besides the accepted centrality of mechanistic\nexplanation for developmental evolution, a much-debated topic concerns\nwhat exactly a developmental mechanism is and how it functions in\nevolutionary explanation compared to standard explanations citing\nnatural selection. \n\nPhilosophers of biology (in the so-called new mechanistic philosophy)\nhave conceptualized mechanistic explanations in biology as the\nconstruction of models of mechanisms that connect parts of systems,\nlocated on one level of organization, with behaviors of the whole\nsystem, usually located on a higher level of organization (Machamer et\nal. 2000; Craver 2007; Illari & Williamson 2012). In this\nframework, mechanistic models relate different compositional levels of\norganization, like genes and phenotypes or cells and tissues. These\ninter-level relations exist between causal capacities of parts of a\nsystem and their organization and the capacities of a system as a\nwhole. Such relations are established following a procedure of\ndecomposition and localization (Bechtel & Richardson 1993; Craver\n2007; Menzies 2012). This conceptual framework to describe biological\nmechanisms and mechanistic explanation has been developed based on\ncase studies in molecular and cell biology. However, scholars have\ncast doubt on whether it is also useful to describe mechanistic\nexplanations in studies of development and developmental\nevolution.\n\nWith respect to development, it has been argued, first, that\norganization plays a different role in mechanistic developmental\nexplanations (Mc Manus 2012). In contrast to the above framework,\nwhich usually presupposes that levels of organization are simply\nthere, and thus it does not have to clarify how levels of organization\nactually originate, the origin of levels and other forms of\norganization (e.g., spatial axes) are specifically addressed in\nmechanistic developmental explanations. Second, philosophers have\nargued that the relations between levels traced by developmental\nmechanisms are not exhausted by the synchronic, constitutive relations\nbetween parts and wholes, as some new mechanists suggest (Craver &\nBechtel 2007). In contrast, developmental explanations trace changing\ndiachronic relationships between causal capacities of a system at\ndifferent levels of organization at different time intervals (Ylikoski\n2013; Baedke & Mc Manus 2018; Baedke 2020; see also Love &\nH\u00fcttemann 2011). Third, it has been argued that explanations in\nevo-devo using developmental mechanisms face a challenge due to the\nheterogeneity of these mechanisms (Love 2018). When trying to\nintegrate two types of explanations of developmental mechanisms\n\u2013 explanations of highly conserved molecular genetic mechanisms,\nlike gene regulatory networks, and explanations of cellular-physical\nmechanisms, like cell migration \u2013 sometimes a tradeoff emerges.\nRather than allowing a more complete explanation, integrating the two\nmechanisms may lead to a less general explanation, since\nnon-phylogenetically conserved cellular-physical mechanisms yield less\ngenerality in explanations. This tradeoff can introduce an explanatory\nbias to projects that seek to integrate development and evolution. It\ncould lead researchers to favors the generality of explanations, which\ncite highly conserved molecular genetic mechanisms and no\ncellular-physical mechanisms, over integrated explanations citing both\nkinds of mechanisms.\n\nWith respect to the concept of mechanism in developmental evolution,\nBrigandt (2015) highlights that some mechanistic explanations in\nevo-devo \u2013 like those on how development biases evolution\n(Radersma et al. forthcoming), how novel variation arises through\ndevelopmental plasticity (Pigliucci 2001, Gilbert 2006), and how\norganisms generate heritable, adaptive phenotypic variation\n(evolvability; see Brown 2014) \u2013 significantly expand the\nstandard analysis of decomposition and localization by dynamical\nmodels (see also Bechtel & Abrahamsen 2010; Brigandt 2013; Baedke\n2020). These models allow predicting the dynamics of developing\nsystems. After decomposing a system and identifying causal\ncontributions of parts or sub-systems, dynamical models help to\ndemonstrate how these contributions operate together to bring about a\nwhole system\u2019s behavior. In this way, they answer how\ndevelopmental mechanisms create evolutionary relevant qualitative\nchanges in phenotypic properties, like robustness, phenotypic\nplasticity, and modularity, through underlying quantitative changes in\ntheir component parts and activities. One classical example of this\nare mathematical models on the robustness of spatial pattering and\nsegmentation in Drosophila. They provide quantitative\ninformation about the interaction of underlying gene network\ncomponents, including, for example, gene transcription rates and decay\nrates of gene products (von Dassow et al. 2000).\n\nOther discussions on the interface between development and evolution\nfocus on the structure of explanations that address how developmental\nmechanisms evolve. Calcott (2009, 2013) has argues that Mayr\u2019s\ndistinction characterizes two kinds of explanation: developmental\nexplanation that answers \u2018How do individuals work\nat a time?\u2019 and evolutionary explanation that answers\n\u2018How do populations change over time?\u2019\nHowever, there is a third kind, called \u2018lineage\nexplanation\u2019. Lineage explanation differs from the above by\nanswering \u2018How do individuals change over\ntime?\u2019 Therefore, they offer a series of mechanistic\nmodels, which trace differences between the developmental mechanisms\nof individuals that produce the relevant morphological structures at\ndifferent times. Over evolutionary time, these relations undergo small\nmodifications, which ultimately bring about novelties, like eyes and\nfeathers, in the whole system. Thus, lineage explanation expands the\nstandards philosophical framework from a single description of a\nmechanism into a series of mechanistic models.\n",
