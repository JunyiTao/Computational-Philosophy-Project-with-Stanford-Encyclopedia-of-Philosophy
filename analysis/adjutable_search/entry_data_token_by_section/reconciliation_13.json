    "main_text": "Reconciliation and Justice\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis entry has explored the various ways that the repair of\nrelationships is conceptualized in the literature, and the processes\nthat are claimed to foster such repair. One lingering question\nremains: what value is there in the pursuit of relational repair? The\nsection on justice suggests two, not incompatible, answers. The\nprocess of repairing relationships is most obviously valuable and\nimportant because of the other goods it enables individuals and\ncommunities to achieve. In the political context, the cessation of\nviolence, the prevention of future violence, and the attainment of\ndemocracy are some values that may be promoted. In more interpersonal\ncontexts, the benefits of relational repair include the avoidance of\nfurther harms to one\u2019s interests, including the psychological\nburden of resentment, or the goods that continued interaction bring,\nsuch as material profit through ongoing trade. But in addition to\nthese sorts of instrumental value, one might also argue that\nreconciliation is valuable for its own sake. Insofar as a relationship\nis intrinsically valuable or morally appropriate, the repair of a\nrelation that has been ruptured acquires derivative intrinsic value.\nInsofar as wrongdoing violates and damages the relationship that ought\nto exist between two morally motivated parties (namely, a relationship\nof mutual respect and a reasonable degree of trust in the\nother\u2019s ability and willingness to abide by appropriate norms of\nbehavior), reconciliation sets things to right.\n",
