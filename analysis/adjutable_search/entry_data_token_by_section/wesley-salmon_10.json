    "main_text": "Explanation and Causality || Explanations vs. Arguments\n5.3 Explanations vs. Arguments\n\nSalmon rejected Hempel\u2019s tenet that an explanation is an\nargument, which he deemed the \u201cthird dogma of empiricism\u201d\n(Salmon 1977a [1998]). His main objection was that although\nirrelevancies are harmless to arguments, they are fatal to\nexplanations. In Salmon\u2019s words:\n\n\nInference, whether deductive or inductive, demands a requirement of\ntotal evidence\u2014a requirement that all relevant evidence\nbe mentioned in the premises. This requirement, which has substantive\nimportance for inductive inferences, is automatically satisfied for\ndeductive inferences. Explanation, in contrast, seems to demand a\nfurther requirement\u2014namely, that only considerations\nrelevant to the explanandum be contained in the explanans. (Salmon\n1977a [1998: 104])\n\n\nFurthermore, arguments are not well suited to account for explanatory\nasymmetry, for there is a disparity of temporal asymmetry in\nexplanations and in arguments that makes the latter fit for prediction\nand retrodiction, but unfit for explanation. Take for instance a lunar\neclipse, which can be predicted on the basis of the laws of motion and\na suitable set of initial conditions holding prior to it. The same\neclipse can also be retrodicted making use of posterior conditions and\nthe same laws. However, explanations are temporally asymmetric in a\nvery specific sense: they go from antecedent conditions to subsequent\nevents. Such asymmetry is not embodied by arguments, which often move\nin the opposite direction. There emerges a divergence between\nprediction, which is an inferential activity, and explanation, which\nis not.\n\nThe asymmetry of explanation reflects that of causation, which for\nSalmon is the key to a satisfactory explanatory account. While\nknowledge of correlations is usually sufficient to bolster prediction,\nexplanation requires more, namely establishing causal relations\nbetween events. A favorite example mentioned by Salmon is that of\n\u201cthe barometer and the storm\u201d. Based on the correlation\nbetween the behavior of the barometer and the occurrence of storms,\none can predict a storm after having observed a sudden drop in the\nbarometer, but nobody would say that the drop in the barometer\nexplains the storm. In similar situations one would look for causal\ninformation, such as the sudden drop in atmospheric pressure in the\narea surrounding the occurrence of the storm. On the one hand, not all\nstatistically relevant properties convey causal information; on the\nother, statistical correlations themselves invoke an explanation. In\nview of this, in the course of the Seventies Salmon gradually came to\nthe conclusion that the S-R model cannot substantiate a satisfactory\naccount of explanation. In a paper entitled \u201cWhy Ask\n\u2018Why?\u2019?\u201d he maintained:\n\n\nI no longer believe that the assemblage of relevant factors provides a\ncomplete explanation\u2014or much of anything in the way of an\nexplanation. We do, I believe, have a bona fide explanation of an\nevent if we have a complete set of statistically relevant factors, the\npertinent probability values, and causal explanations of the relevance\nrelations (1978a [1998: 137]).\n\n",
