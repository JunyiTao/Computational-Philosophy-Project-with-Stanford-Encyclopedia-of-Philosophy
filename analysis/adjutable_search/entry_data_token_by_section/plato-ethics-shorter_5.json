    "main_text": "The Impossibility of Acrasia\n9. The Impossibility of Acrasia\n\nSocrates\u2019 doctrine on this, apparently, is that knowledge of\nwhat is right cannot be overcome by pleasure or passion. After\nAristotle, philosophers have termed this the issue of\nacrasia. Acrasia, weakness of will, would occur when\nsomeone who knows what is right does what is wrong under the influence\nof passion or in order to secure pleasure.\n\nHolders of expert knowledge are supposed to be reliable in the\nexercise of that knowledge; they are professionals, and part of their\nprofessionalism is to ply their trade competently regardless of the\nweight of passion or the blandishments of pleasure. So the\ntechne analogy might be construed to imply the impossibility\nof acrasia. Socrates\u2019 argument for this in the\n Protagoras,\n however, is based on his demonstration that the popular explanation\nfor weak-willed behavior (that knowledge is overcome by pleasure) is\nincoherent. Socrates is not denying that people do wrong under the\ninfluence of passion or desire for pleasure; he is rejecting the usual\nexplanation for this, and denying that it occurs in the case of those\nwho have the relevant knowledge. Plainly, the doctrine presupposes a\nstringent criterion for knowledge, at least as demanding as the test\nfor techne.\n\nScholars dispute the question whether Socrates is committed to the\nconclusion he draws for Protagoras. The point may be dialectically\ndirected at Protagoras: if virtue is teachable, as Protagoras says it\nis, then this unlikely result would follow. \n\nA related doctrine is that no one errs voluntarily, a doctrine Plato\nholds consistently from the Apology to the Laws. If\nacrasia is impossible, then every moral error involves a\ncognitive failure about the action or the principle that it violates,\nand cognitive errors negative (or at least weaken) responsibility for\nactions caused by those errors. Socrates generally assumes that\nactions taken in ignorance are involuntary, and that therefore the\nproper response to wrongdoing is not retribution, but education, as he\nsays in the Apology (25e\u201326a).\n\nIn the\n Hippias Minor,\n by contrast, Socrates argues that it is better to do wrong\nvoluntarily than in ignorance. Although he is unhappy with this\nconclusion, he gives no direct hints as to how to avoid it.\n\nOn acrasia see Segvic 2005, Weiss 2006, and Devereaux\n2008.\n",
