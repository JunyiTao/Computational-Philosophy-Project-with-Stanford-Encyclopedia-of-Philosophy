    "main_text": "The Debate After Davidson || Internalist and Externalist Strands\n3.1 Internalist and Externalist Strands\n\n\nDavidson has certainly presented an arresting theory of practical \nreasoning. But has he shown how weakness of the will is possible? \nMost philosophers writing after him, while acknowledging his \npathbreaking work on the issue, think he has not. One principal \ndifficulty which subsequent theorists have seized on is that \nDavidson\u2019s view can account for the possibility of action contrary to\none\u2019s better judgment only if one\u2019s better judgment is \nconstrued merely as a conditional or prima facie judgment. \nDavidson\u2019s P1 and P2 in fact rule out the possibility of free \nintentional action contrary to an all-out or unconditional evaluative\n judgment.[11]\n But it seems that such cases exist. Michael Bratman, for instance, \nintroduces us to Sam, who, in a depressed state, is deep into a \nbottle of wine, despite his acknowledged need for an early wake-up \nand a clear head tomorrow (1979, p. 156). Sam\u2019s friend, stopping \nby, says:\n\n  Look here. Your reasons for abstaining seem clearly stronger than\n  your reasons for drinking. So how can you have thought that it would\n  be best to drink?\n\nTo which Sam replies:\n\n  I don\u2019t think it would be best to drink. Do you think\n  I\u2019m stupid enough to think that, given how strong my reasons\n  for abstaining are? I think it would be best to abstain. Still,\n  I\u2019m drinking. \n\n\n\nSam\u2019s case certainly seems possible as described. Davidson\u2019s view, \nthough, must reject it as impossible. Given his conduct, Sam can\u2019t \nthink it best to abstain; at most, he thinks it all-things-considered\nbest to abstain, a very different kettle of fish. But this seems \nfalse of Sam: there is no evidence that he has remained stuck at the \nHercule Poirot stage with respect to the superiority of abstaining. \nHe seems to have gone all the way to a judgment sans phrase \nthat abstaining would be better; and yet he drinks.\n\n\nIronically, this complaint makes Davidson out to be a bit like Hare. \nLike Hare, Davidson subscribes to an internalist principle (P2) which\nconnects evaluative judgments with motivation and hence with action. \n(Indeed, in light of the difficulty raised here, one might wonder if \nDavidson is entitled to consider P2 a \u201cmild\u201d form of \ninternalism (p. 26).) As with Hare, this internalist commitment \nrules out as impossible certain kinds of action contrary to one\u2019s \nevaluative judgment. Now Davidson, like Hare, does accept the \npossibility of certain phenomena in this neighborhood; but\u2014as \nwith Hare\u2014critics think the cases permitted by his analysis \nsimply do not exhaust the range of actual cases of weakness of will. \nThe phenomenon seems to run one step ahead of our attempts to make \nroom for it.\n\n\nThose writing after Davidson have tended to focus, then, on the \nquestion of the possibility and rational status of action contrary to\none\u2019s unconditional better \n judgment.[12]\nNaturally, different theorists have plotted different courses through\nthese shoals. Some tack more to the internalist side, wishing to\npreserve a strong internal connection between evaluation and action\neven at the risk of denying or seeming to deny the possibility of\nakratic action (or at least some understandings of it). Examples of\nsome post-Davidson treatments which share a broadly internalist\nemphasis, even if they feature different flavors of internalism, are\nthose of Bratman (1979), Buss (1997), Tenenbaum (1999; see also 2007,\nch. 7), and Stroud (2003). The main danger for such approaches is that\nin seeking to preserve and defend a certain picture of the primordial\nrole of evaluative thought in rational action\u2014a picture critics\nare likely to dismiss as too rationalistic\u2014such theorists may be\nled to reject common phenomena which ought properly to have\nconstrained their more abstract theories. (See the opening of Wiggins\n1979 for a forceful articulation of this criticism.)\n\n\nOther theorists, by contrast, are more drawn toward the externalist \nshoreline. They emphasize the motivational importance of factors \nother than the agent\u2019s evaluative judgment and the divergences that \ncan result between an agent\u2019s evaluation of her options and her \nmotivation to act. They are thus disinclined to posit any strong, \nnecessary link between evaluative judgment and action. Michael \nStocker, for instance, argues that the philosophical tradition has \nbeen led astray in assuming that evaluation dictates motivation. \n\u201cMotivation and evaluation do not stand in a simple and direct \nrelation to each other, as so often supposed,\u201d he writes. \nRather, \u201ctheir interrelations are mediated by large arrays of \ncomplex psychic structures, such as mood, energy, and interest\u201d\n(1979, pp. 738\u20139). Similarly, Alfred Mele proposes as a \nfundamental and general truth\u2014and one that underlies the \npossibility of akrasia\u2014that \u201cthe motivational \nforce of a want may be out of line with the agent\u2019s evaluation of the\nobject of that want\u201d (1987, p. 37). Mele goes on to offer \nseveral different reasons why the two can come apart: for example, \nrewards perceived as proximate can exert a motivational \ninfluence disproportionate to the value the agent reflectively \nattaches to them (1987, ch. 6). Such wants may function as \nstrong causes even if the agent takes them to constitute \nweak reasons.\n\n With respect to these questions, the challenge sketched at the end of\nSection 1 above remains in full force. What is required is a view\nwhich successfully navigates between the Scylla of an extreme\ninternalism about evaluative judgment which would preclude the\npossibility of weakness of will, and the Charybdis of an extreme\nexternalism which would deny any privileged role to evaluative\njudgment in practical reasoning or rational action. For one\u2019s\nverdict about akrasia will in general be closely connected to\none\u2019s more general views of action, practical reasoning,\nrationality, and evaluative judgment\u2014as was certainly true of\nDavidson.\n\n\nViews that downplay the role of evaluative judgment in action and \nhence tack more toward the externalist side of the channel may more \neasily be able to accept the possibility and indeed the actuality of \nweakness of will. But they are subject to their own challenges. For \nexample, suppose we follow Mele\u2019s image of akrasia and posit\nthat a certain agent is caused to do x by motivation to do \nx which is dramatically out of kilter with her assessment of\nthe merits of doing x. In what sense, then, is her doing \nx free, intentional, and uncompelled? Such an agent might \nseem rather to be at the mercy of a motivational force which is, from\nher point of view, utterly alien. Thus, worries about distinguishing \nakrasia from compulsion come back in full force in \nconnection with proposals like these. (See \n fn. 7\n above for relevant references; Buss and Tenenbaum press these worries\nagainst accounts like Mele\u2019s in particular.) Moreover, there is the \ndanger, for accounts of this more externalist stripe, of taking too \nmuch of the mystery out of weakness of will. Even if akratic action \nis possible and indeed actual, it remains a puzzling, marginal, \nsomehow defective instance of agency, one that we rightly find not \nfully intelligible. Views that do not assign a privileged place in \nrational deliberation and action to the agent\u2019s overall assessment of\nher options risk making akratic action seem no more problematic than \nJulie\u2019s or Jimmy\u2019s decisions, or Hare\u2019s agent who fails to pick up \nthe roundest stone in the vicinity.\n",
