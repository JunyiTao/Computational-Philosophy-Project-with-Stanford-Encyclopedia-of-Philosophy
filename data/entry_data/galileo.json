    "main_text": "\n1. Brief Biography\n\nGalileo was born in Pisa on February 15, 1564. By the time he died on\nJanuary 8, 1642 (but for problems with the date, see Machamer 1998b,\n24\u201325), he was as famous as any person in Europe. Moreover, when\nhe was born there was no such thing as \u2018science\u2019; yet by\nthe time he died, science was well on its way to becoming a\ndiscipline, and its concepts and method a complete philosophical\nsystem.\n\nGalileo\u2019s father Vincenzo, though of noble heritage, was a\nsemi-itinerant court musician and composer of modest means, who also\nauthored treatises on music theory; his mother, Giulia Ammannati,\ndescended from Pisan cloth merchants. In 1572, they resettled the\nfamily in Florence. As a boy, Galileo was tutored privately and, for a\ntime, by the monks at Vallombrosa, where he considered a religious\nvocation and may have started a novitiate. He returned home, however,\nand then enrolled for a medical degree at the University of Pisa in\n1580. He never completed this degree, but instead studied mathematics,\nnotably with Ostilio Ricci, a mathematics teacher attached to the\nTuscan court and the Florentine Accademia del Disegno.\n\nAfter leaving university, Galileo worked as a private mathematics\ntutor around Florence and Siena and cultivated the support of leading\nmathematicians. He visited Christoph Clavius, professor at the Jesuit\nCollegio Romano, and corresponded with the engineer Guildobaldo del\nMonte, Marchese of Urbino. In 1588, he applied and was turned down for\na professorship in Bologna, but a year later, with the help of Clavius\nand del Monte, he was appointed lecturer in mathematics at Pisa. In\n1592, he obtained, at a much higher salary, a chair of mathematics at\nthe University of Padua, in the Venetian Republic. Galileo also\nsupplemented his income by producing a calculating instrument of his\nown design (see Galilei 1606) and other devices in a household\nworkshop, and by private tutoring and consulting on practical\nmathematics and engineering. During this period, he began a\nrelationship with Marina Gamba, and their daughter Virginia was born\nin 1600. In 1601, they had another daughter, Livia, and a son,\nVincenzo, in 1606.\n\nIn Padua, Galileo worked out much of the mechanics he would publish\nlater in life, and which constitute his primary lasting\ncontribution to physical science. However, these projects were\ninterrupted in 1609, when Galileo heard about the recently invented\nspyglass, invented an improved telescope, and used it to make\nastounding celestial discoveries. He rushed these into print in\nSidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which appeared\nin March 1610 and launched Galileo onto the world stage. Among others,\nJohannes Kepler, Imperial Mathematician at Prague, lauded the work\n(Kepler 1610). Clavius and his colleagues at the Collegio Romano\nconfirmed its results and threw a celebratory banquet when Galileo\nvisited in 1611. During the same Roman sojourn, Galileo was admitted\nto what was perhaps the first scientific society, the Accademia dei\nLincei; he would style himself \u201cLincean Academician\u201d for\nthe rest of his life. Some fascinating treatments of this period\nof Galileo\u2019s life and motivations have recently appeared\n(Biagioli 2006; Reeves 2008; Wilding 2014).\n\nGalileo also used the Starry Messenger to solicit patronage\nin his native Tuscany, naming the moons of Jupiter he had found the\n\u201cMedicean\u201d stars, in honor of the ruling Medici family.\nHis negotiations were ultimately successful, and Galileo moved to\nFlorence as \u201cChief Mathematician and Philosopher to the Grand\nDuke\u201d and holder of a sinecure professorship at Pisa. His\ndaughters moved with him and were shortly placed in the convent of\nSaint Matthew at Arcetri, near Florence. Vincenzo and his mother,\nMarina, were left behind in Venice.\n\nOnce a courtier, Galileo entered into several debates on scientific\ntopics. In 1612, he published a Discourse on Floating Bodies,\nand in 1613, Letters on Sunspots, where he first openly\nexpressed support for Copernican heliocentrism. In 1613\u201314,\nGalileo entered into discussions of Copernicanism through his student\nBenedetto Castelli, and wrote a Letter to Castelli\ndefending the doctrine from theological objections. Meanwhile, it\nhad become known that Copernicanism was under scrutiny by Church\nauthorities. Galileo lectured and lobbied against its condemnation,\nexpanding his Letter to Castelli into the widely\ncirculated Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina in 1615\nand travelling to Rome late that year. Nevertheless, in March 1616,\nCopernicus\u2019s On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs\nwas suspended (i.e., temporarily censored), pending correction,\nby the Congregation of the Index of Prohibited Books. Galileo himself\nwas called to an audience with Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, a leading\ntheologian and member of the Roman Inquisition, who admonished him not\nto teach or defend Copernican theory. (The details of this episode are\nfar from straightforward, and remain disputed even today. See Shea and\nArtigas 2003; Fantoli 2005.)\n\nIn 1623, Galileo published The Assayer, which deals with\nthe nature of comets and argues they are sublunary phenomena. This\nbook includes some of Galileo\u2019s most famous methodological\npronouncements, including the claim that the book of nature is written\nin the language of mathematics. It also contains passages suggestive\nof atomism, a heretical doctrine, for which the book was referred to\nthe Inquisition, which dismissed the charge.\n\nAlso in 1623, Maffeo Barberini, Galileo\u2019s supporter and friend,\nwas elected Pope Urban VIII. Galileo felt empowered to begin work on\nhis Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. The\n\u201ctwo systems\u201d are the Ptolemaic and Copernican, and the\ntext clearly, though not explicitly, favors the latter. Printing was\ncompleted in Florence by February 1632. Shortly afterwards, the\nInquisition banned its sale, and Galileo was ordered to Rome for\ntrial. In June 1633, Galileo was convicted of \u201cvehement\nsuspicion of heresy,\u201d and a sentence of imprisonment was\nimmediately commuted to perpetual house arrest. (There is more about\nthese events and their implications in the final section of this\n article, Galileo and the Church.)\n\nIn 1634, while Galileo was confined to his villa in Arcetri, his\nbeloved eldest daughter died (Sobel 1999). Around this time, he began\nwork on his final book, Discourses and Mathematical\nDemonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences, based on the\nmechanics he had developed early in his career. The manuscript was\nsmuggled out of Italy and published in Holland by the Elzeviers in\n1638. Galileo died early in 1642, and due to his condemnation, his\nburial place was obscure until he was re-interred in 1737.\n\nFor detailed biographical material, the best and classic work dealing\nwith Galileo\u2019s scientific achievements is Stillman\nDrake\u2019s Galileo at Work (1978). More\nrecently, J. L. Heilbron has written a magnificent\nbiography, Galileo (2010), that touches on all the\nmultiple facets of his life. \n2. Introduction and Background\n\nFrom the seventeenth century onward, Galileo has been seen by many as\nthe \u201chero\u201d of modern science. He is renowned for his\ndiscoveries: he was the first to report telescopic observations of the\nmountains on the moon, the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and\nthe rings of Saturn. He invented an early microscope and a predecessor\nto the thermometer. In mathematical physics\u2014a discipline he\nhelped create\u2014he calculated the law of free fall, conceived of\nan inertial principle, determined the parabolic trajectory of\nprojectiles, and advocated the relativity of motion. He is thought to\nbe the first \u201creal\u201d experimental scientist, who dropped\nstones from towers and ships\u2019 masts, and played with magnets,\nclocks, and pendulums (noting the isochrony of the latter). Much of\nhis cultural stature also arises from his advocacy and popularization\nof Copernicanism and the resulting condemnation by the Catholic\nInquisition, which has made him a purported \u201cmartyr\u201d to\nthe cause of rationality and enlightened modernity in the subsequent\nhistory of a supposed \u201cwarfare\u201d between science and\nreligion. This is no small set of accomplishments for one\nseventeenth-century Italian, who was the son of a court musician and\nwho left the University of Pisa without a degree.\n\nMomentous figures living in momentous times are full of interpretive\nfecundity, and Galileo has been the subject of manifold\ninterpretations and much controversy. The use of Galileo\u2019s work\nand the invocations of his name make a fascinating history\n(Segre 1991; Palmerino and Thijssen 2004; Finocchiaro 2005; Shea\nand Artigas 2006), but this is not our topic, which are the\nphilosophical implications of his work.\n\nPhilosophically, Galileo has been used to exemplify many different\nthemes, usually as a personification of whatever the writer wished to\nmake the hallmark of the Scientific Revolution or of the nature of\ngood science\u2014whatever was good about the new science or science\nin general, it was Galileo who started it. One tradition of Galileo\nscholarship has divided Galileo\u2019s work into three or four parts:\n(1) his physics, (2) his astronomy, and (3) his methodology, which\nmight include his method of Biblical interpretation and/or his\nthoughts about the nature of proof or demonstration. In this\ntradition, typical treatments deal with his physical and astronomical\ndiscoveries and their background and/or who were Galileo\u2019s\npredecessors. More philosophically, many ask how his mathematical\npractice relates to his natural philosophy. Was he a mathematical\nPlatonist (Jardine 1976; Koyr\u00e9 1978), an experimentalist\n(Settle 1967; Settle 1983; Settle 1992; Palmieri 2008), an\nAristotelian emphasizing experience (Geymonat 1954), a precursor of\nmodern positivist science (Drake 1978), or maybe an Archimedean\n(Machamer 1998a), who might have used a revised Scholastic method of\nproof (Wallace 1992; Miller 2018)? Or did he have no method and just\nfly like an eagle in the way that geniuses do (Feyerabend 1975)?\nAlongside these claims there have been attempts to place Galileo in an\nintellectual context that brings out the background to his\nachievements. Some have emphasized his debt to the artisan/engineer\npractical tradition (Rossi 1962; Valleriani 2010), others his\nmathematics (Giusti 1993; Feldhay 1998; Renn, et al. 2000; Palmieri\n2001; Palmieri 2003; Peterson 2011; Palmerino 2016), his mixed (or\nsubalternate) mathematics (Machamer 1978; Lennox 1986; Wallace 1992;\nDear 1995; Machamer 1998a), his debt to atomism (Shea 1972; Redondi\n1983), his use of Hellenistic and Medieval impetus theory (Moody 1951;\nDuhem 1954; Clagett 1959; Shapere 1974), or the idea that discoveries\nbring new data into science (Wootton 2015).\n\nStill, almost everyone working in this tradition seems to think the\nthree areas\u2014physics, astronomy, and methodology\u2014are\nsomewhat distinct and represent different Galilean endeavors. More\nrecent historical research has followed contemporary intellectual\nfashion and shifted foci, bringing new dimensions to our understanding\nof Galileo by studying his rhetoric (Finocchiaro 1980; Moss 1993;\nFeldhay 1998; Spranzi 2004), the power structures of his social milieu\n(Biagioli 1993; Biagioli 2006), his personal quest for acknowledgment\n(Shea and Artigas 2003), and more generally emphasizing the larger\nsocial and cultural history (Reeves 2008; Bucciantini, et al. 2015),\nin particular the court and papal culture in which Galileo\nfunctioned (Redondi 1983; Heilbron 2010).\n\nIn an intellectualist recidivist mode, this entry will outline his\ninvestigations in physics and astronomy and exhibit, in a new way, how\nthese all cohered in a unified inquiry. In setting out this path, we\nshall show why, at the end of his life, Galileo felt compelled (in\nsome sense of necessity) to write the Two New Sciences,\nwhich stands as a true completion of his overall project and is not\njust a reworking of his earlier research that he reverted to after his\ntrial, when he was under house arrest and going blind. Particularly,\nwe shall try to show why both of the two new sciences,\nespecially the first, were so important\u2014a topic not much\ntreated except recently (Biener 2004; Raphael 2011). In\npassing, we shall touch on his methodology and his mathematics, and\nhere refer you to some of the recent work by Palmieri (2001; 2003). At\nthe end, we shall add some words about Galileo, the Catholic Church,\nand his trial.\n3. Galileo\u2019s Scientific Story\n\nThe philosophical thread that runs through Galileo\u2019s\nintellectual life is a strong and increasing desire to find a new\nconception of what constitutes natural philosophy and how natural\nphilosophy ought to be pursued. Galileo signaled this goal clearly\nwhen he left Padua in 1610 to return to Florence and the court of the\nMedici. He asked for and received the designation\n\u2018Philosopher\u2019, in addition to \u2018Mathematician\u2019.\nThis was not just a status-affirming request, but also a reflection of\nhis programmatic aims. What Galileo accomplished by the end of his\nlife was a reasonably articulated replacement for the traditional set\nof analytical concepts connected with the Aristotelian tradition of\nnatural philosophy. He offered, in place of the Aristotelian\ncategories, a set of mechanical archetypes that were accepted by most\neveryone who afterwards developed the \u201cnew sciences,\u201d and\nwhich, in some form or another, became the hallmark of the new\nphilosophy. His way of thinking became the way of the Scientific\nRevolution (and yes, there was such a revolution, pace Shapin\n1996 and others; see the selections in Lindberg and Westman 1990;\nOsler 2000).\n\nSome scholars might wish to describe what Galileo achieved in\npsychological terms, as an introduction of new mental models (Palmieri\n2003) or a new model of intelligibility (Machamer 1994; Machamer,\n1998a; Adams, et al. 2017). However phrased, Galileo\u2019s main move\nwas to dethrone the Aristotelian physical categories; namely, the one\ncelestial element (aether, or quintessence\u2014i.e.,\n\u201cfifth element\u201d) and the four terrestrial ones (fire, air,\nwater, and earth), along with their respective motive natures\n(circular, and up and down). In their place, he left only one\nelement, corporeal matter, whose properties and motions he described\nusing the mathematics of proportional relations typified by the\nArchimedian simple machines\u2014the balance, the inclined plane, and\nthe lever\u2014to which Galileo added the pendulum (Machamer 1998a;\nMachamer and Hepburn 2004; Palmieri 2008). In doing so, Galileo\nchanged the acceptable way of talking about matter and its motion, and\nso ushered in the mechanical tradition that characterizes so much of\nmodern science, even today. See Dijksterhuis 1961; Machamer, et al.\n2000; Gaukroger 2006; Roux and Garber 2013.\n\nAs a way of understanding Galileo\u2019s accomplishments, it is\nuseful to see him as being interested in finding a unified theory of\nmatter\u2014a mathematical theory of the material stuff that\nconstitutes the whole of the cosmos. Perhaps he did not realize that\nthis was his grand project until the time he actually wrote the\nTwo New Sciences in the mid-1630s. Despite working on\nproblems of the nature of matter from 1590 onwards, he could not have\nwritten his final work much earlier than 1638; certainly not\nbefore the Starry Messenger of 1610, and probably\nnot before the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World\nSystems of 1632. He had thought deeply about the nature of\nmatter before 1610 and had tried to work out how best to describe\nmatter, but before 1632, he did not have the theory and evidence he\nneeded to support his claims about a unified, singular matter. The\nidea of unified matter theory had to wait for the\nestablishment of principles of matter\u2019s motion on a moving\nEarth. And this he did not accomplish until\nthe Dialogue.\n\nGalileo began his critique of Aristotle in a treatise he drafted\naround 1590, titled De Motu (On Motion). The\nfirst part of this manuscript deals with terrestrial matter and argues\nthat Aristotle\u2019s theory has it wrong. For Aristotle, the matter\nof the terrestrial realm within the sphere of the moon is of four\nelemental kinds\u2014earth, water, air, and fire. These possess two\nformal principles that give rise to their natural motion: heaviness\n(gravitas; in earth and water) and lightness\n(levitas; in air and fire). Galileo, using an Archimedean\nmodel of floating bodies, and later the balance, argues that there is\nonly one principle of motion\u2014heaviness. Bodies move upward not\nbecause they have a natural lightness, he says, but because they are\ndisplaced or extruded by other heavier bodies moving downward. So on\nhis view, heaviness is the cause of all natural terrestrial\nmotion.\n\nThis move left Galileo with a problem: what is heaviness and how is it\nto be described? In De Motu, he argued that the moving\narms of a balance could be used as a model for treating all problems\nof natural motion. In this model, heaviness is the proportionality of\nthe weight of an object on one arm of the balance to the weight of\nanother body on the other arm. In the context of floating bodies,\nheaviness is the weight of one body minus the weight of the medium.\nGalileo quickly realized these characterizations were insufficient,\nand so began to explore how heaviness might be related to specific\ngravities; i.e., the comparative weights of bodies having equal\nvolume. He was trying to figure out the concept of heaviness that is\ncharacteristic of all matter. What he failed to work out\u2014and\nthis was probably the reason why he never published De\nMotu\u2014was this positive characterization of heaviness. There\nseemed to be no way to find a standard measure of heaviness that would\nwork across different substances. At this point, he did not have a\nuseful replacement for Aristotelian gravitas.\n\nA while later, in his 1600 manuscript version of Le\nMeccaniche (On Mechanics), Galileo introduced the\nconcept of momento, a quasi force\nthat applies to a body at a moment, and which is somehow proportional\nto weight or specific gravity (Galluzzi 1979). Still, he had no good\nway to measure or compare specific gravities of bodies of different\nkinds, and his notebooks during this early seventeenth-century period\nreflect his trying again and again to find a way to bring all matter\nunder a single proportional measuring scale. He tried to study\nacceleration along an inclined plane and to find a way to think of\nwhat changes acceleration brings to momento. Yet the details\nand categories of how to properly treat weight and movement eluded\nhim.\n\nWe see from this period that Galileo\u2019s law of free fall arises\nout of this struggle to find the proper categories for his new science\nof matter and motion. Galileo accepted, probably as early as the 1594\ndraft of Le Meccaniche, that natural motions might be\naccelerated. Particularly in the cases of the pendulum, the inclined\nplane, free fall, and projectile motion, Galileo must have observed\nthat the speeds of bodies increase as they move downwards and,\nperhaps, do so naturally. But that accelerated motion is properly\nmeasured against time is an idea he realized only later, chiefly\nthrough his failure to find any satisfactory dependence on place and\nspecific gravity. Also at this time, he began to think about\npercussive force. For many years, he thought that the correct science\nof these phenomena should describe how bodies change according to\nwhere they are on their paths. Specifically, it seemed that height is\ncrucial. Percussive force is directly related to height and the motion\nof the pendulum seems to involve equilibrium with respect to the\nheight of the bob (and time also, but isochrony did not lead directly\nto a recognition of time\u2019s importance).\n\nOne of Galileo\u2019s problems was that the Archimedian simple\nmachines he was using as his models of intelligibility, especially the\nbalance, are not easily conceived of in a dynamic way (but see\nMachamer and Woody 1994). Since they generally work by establishing\nstatic equilibrium, time is not a feature of their action one would\nnormally attend to. In discussing a balance, for instance, one does\nnot normally think about how fast an arm of the balance descends, nor\nhow fast a body on the opposite arm is rising (though Galileo does in\nhis Postils to Rocco circa 1634\u201345; see\nPalmieri 2005). The converse is also true. It is difficult to model\ndynamic phenomena that involve rates of change as balance arms moving\nupwards or downwards because of differential weights. So it was that\nGalileo\u2019s puzzle about how to describe time and the force of\npercussion (the force of body\u2019s impact) would remain unsolved.\nThroughout his life, he could not find systematic relations among\nspecific gravities, heights of fall, and percussive forces. Even while\nthe Two New Sciences was going to press in 1638, Galileo was\nlaboring on an additional \u201cFifth Day\u201d (not published until\n1718) that presciently explored the concept of the force of\npercussion, which would become, after his death, one of the most\nfecund ways to think about matter and its motion.\n\nIn the period 1603\u20139, Galileo experimented with inclined planes\nand, most importantly, pendulums. These studies again exhibited to\nGalileo that acceleration and, therefore, time is a crucial variable.\nMoreover, the isochrony of the pendulum\u2014the period depends only\non the length of the cord, regardless of the weight of the\nbob\u2014went some way towards showing that time is a possible term\nin the equilibrium (or ratio) that needs to be made explicit to\nrepresent motion. It also shows that, in at least one case, time can\ndisplace weight as a crucial variable.\n\nThe law of free fall\u2014i.e., a body in free fall from rest\ntraverses a distance proportional to the square of the time\nelapsed\u2014was discovered by Galileo through the inclined plane\nexperiments (Drake 1999, v. 2). At first, Galileo attempted to\nrepresent this phenomenon with a velocity-distance relation, and the\nequivalent mean proportional relation. His later and correct\ndefinition of natural acceleration dependent on time was an insight\ngained through recognizing the physical significance of that mean\nproportional relation (Machamer and Hepburn 2004; for a different\nanalysis of Galileo\u2019s discovery of free fall see Renn, et al.\n2000). Yet Galileo would not publish anything making time central to\nhis analysis of motion until 1638, in the Two New\nSciences.\n\nIn 1609, Galileo began his work with the telescope. There are many\nways to describe Galileo\u2019s findings, and many interpreters have\ntaken this to be an interlude irrelevant to his physics. However,\nthey are remarkable insofar as they are his start at dismantling the\ncelestial-terrestrial distinction entrenched in Aristotelian cosmology\n(Feyerabend 1975). Perhaps the most unequivocal case of this is when\nhe analogizes the mountains on the moon to mountains in Bohemia in the\nStarry Messenger. Also crucial was his discovery of the four\nmoons circling Jupiter, which lent credence to the Copernican system\nsince it meant that a planet-moon arrangement was not unique to the\nEarth. The abandonment of the dichotomy between heavens and earth\nimplied that all matter, whether celestial or terrestrial, is of the\nsame kind. Further, if there is only one kind of matter, there can be\nonly one kind of natural motion\u2014one kind of motion that this\nmatter has by nature. So it has to be that one law of motion will hold\nthroughout the terrestrial and celestial realms. This is a far\nstronger claim than he had made in 1590, which concerned only the\nterrestrial elements.\n\nA few years later, in his Letters on\nSunspots (1613), Galileo offered new telescopic evidence\nthat supported the Copernican theory. But these observations also\nserved as additional reasons for dissolving the celestial-terrestrial\ndistinction. One was that the sun is not an immutable aetherial\nsphere, but has changing spots (maculae) on its surface.\nAnother was that the sun rotates circularly around its axis, like the\nEarth. A third was the discovery that Venus undergoes a full sequence\nof phases (like the moon), which entails that Venus revolves around\nthe sun, and suggests that the Earth is likewise a celestial body\nmoving around the sun. Certainly the phases of Venus contradicted the\nPtolemaic ordering of the planets.\n\nLater, in 1623, Galileo argued for a quite mistaken material thesis.\nIn The Assayer, he tried to show that comets are\nsublunary phenomena and that their properties could be explained by\noptical refraction. While this work stands as a masterpiece of\nscientific rhetoric, it is somewhat strange that Galileo should have\nargued against the superlunary nature of comets, which the great\nDanish astronomer Tycho Brahe had demonstrated earlier.\n\nYet even with all these developments, Galileo still needed to work out\ngeneral principles concerning the nature of motion for this newly\nunified matter. In this respect, Galileo differed from Ptolemy (at\nleast of the Almagest), Copernicus, or even Tycho Brahe, who\ntreated their planetary systems\u2014be they Earth- or\nsun-centered\u2014merely as models of the planets\u2019 observed\nmotions; that is, as mathematical conceits for calculating observable\npositions. For Galileo, by contrast, Copernicanism was also a\ncommitment to a physically realizable cosmography. Consequently, he\nneeded to work out, at least qualitatively, a way of thinking about\nthe actual motions of matter. He had to devise (or shall we say,\ndiscover) principles of local motion that would fit a central sun,\nplanets moving around that sun, a whirling Earth, and everything on\nit.\n\nThis he did by introducing two new principles. In Day One of\nhis Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World\nSystems (1632), Galileo argues that matter will move\nnaturally along circular trajectories, neither speeding up nor slowing\ndown. Then, in Day Two, he introduces his version of the famous\nprinciple of the relativity of observed motion. This latter holds that\nobservers cannot detect uniform motions they share with objects under\nobservation; only differential motion can be seen. Of course, neither\nof these principles was entirely original with Galileo. They had\npredecessors. But no one needed them for the reasons that he did,\nnamely that they were necessitated by a unified cosmological\nmatter.\n\nOne key effect of these principles is that the diurnal terrestrial\nrotation asserted by the Copernican system is unobservable. The Earth\nand all the objects on it naturally move in circles around the\nEarth\u2019s axis once a day, but since human observers share this\nmotion, it cannot be detected. We only notice departures from shared\nrotation, such as bodies falling or rising. Consequently, \u201call\nexperiments practicable upon the Earth are insufficient\nmeasures\u201d for proving its stability or its mobility,\n\u201csince they are indifferently adaptable to an Earth in motion or\nat rest\u201d (Galilei 1967, 6). This blunted standard objections to\nCopernicanism on the grounds that there is no evidence of terrestrial\nmotion.\n\nHaving dispelled these arguments against the Copernican system,\nGalileo then dramatically argues in its favor. In Day Three of the\nDialogue. Salviati, Galileo\u2019s avatar, has Simplicio,\nthe ever-astounded Aristotelian, make use of astronomical\nobservations, especially the facts that Venus has phases and that\nVenus and Mercury are never far from the sun, to construct a diagram\nof the planetary positions. The resulting diagram neatly corresponds\nto the Copernican model. Then in Day Four, Galileo offers a supposed\nproof of Copernican theory on the basis of the tides, asserting that\nthey result from the combination of the Earth\u2019s diurnal rotation\nand its annual motion around the sun.\n\nIn the Dialogue, things are more complicated than we\nhave just sketched. Galileo, as noted, argues for circular natural\nmotion. Yet he also introduces, in places, an intrinsic tendency for\nrectilinear motion. For example, Galileo recognizes that a stone\nwhirled circularly in a sling would fly off along the rectilinear\ntangent if released (Galilei 1967, 189\u201394; see Hooper 1998).\nFurther, in Day Four, when he is giving his mechanical explanation of\nthe tides, he nuances his matter theory by attributing to water an\nadditional power of retaining an impetus for motion such that it can\ngenerate a reciprocal movement once it is sloshed against a side of a\nbasin. This was not Galileo\u2019s first dealing with water. We saw\nit first in the De Motu around 1590, where Galileo\ndiscusses submerged and floating bodies, but he learned much more in\nhis dispute over floating bodies (which produced the Discourse on\nFloating Bodies in 1612). In fact, a large part of that debate\nturned on the exact nature of water as matter, and what kind of\nmathematical proportionality could be used to correctly describe it\nand bodies moving in it (see Palmieri 1998; 2004).\n\nThe final chapter of Galileo\u2019s scientific story came in 1638,\nwith the publication of the Two New Sciences. The second\nscience, discussed in the last two Days, deals with the principles of\nlocal motion and has been much commented upon in the Galilean\nliterature. But the first science, discussed in the first two Days,\nhas been misunderstood and infrequently discussed. It has misleadingly\nbeen called the science of the strength of materials, and so seems to\nhave found a place in history of engineering, since such a course is\nstill taught today. However, this science is not about the strength of\nmaterials per se. It is Galileo\u2019s attempt to\nprovide a mathematical science of his unified matter (see Machamer\n1998a; Biener 2004; Machamer and Hepburn 2004). Galileo realizes that,\nbefore he can work out a science of the motion of matter, he must have\nsome way of showing that the nature of matter may be mathematically\ncharacterized. Both the mathematical nature of matter and the\nmathematical principles of motion he believes belong to the science of\n\u201cmechanics,\u201d which is the name he gives for this new way\nof philosophizing.\n\nSo it is in Day One that Galileo begins to discuss how to describe\nmathematically (or geometrically) the causes of the breaking of beams.\nBut this requires a way to reconcile mathematical description with the\nphysical constitution of material bodies. In this vein, Galileo\nrejects using finite atoms as a basis for physical discussion, since\nthey are not representable by continuously divisible mathematical\nmagnitudes. Instead, he treats matter as composed of infinitely many\nindivisible\u2014which is to say, mathematical\u2014points. This\nallows him to give mathematical accounts for various properties of\nmatter. Among these are the density of matter, its coherence in\nmaterial bodies, and the properties of the resisting media in which\nbodies move. The Second Day lays out the mathematical principles\nconcerning how bodies break. Galileo does all this by reducing the\nproblems of matter to problems of how a lever and a balance function,\nwhich renders them mathematically tractable via the law of the lever.\nHe had begun this back in 1590, though this time he believes he is\ngetting it right, showing mathematically how bits of matter solidify\nand stick together, and how they break into bits.\n\nThe First Day also contains Galileo\u2019s account of the\nacceleration of falling bodies, and the argument that they fall\nequally fast in a vacuum, whatever their weight. This discussion\ncontains the famous thought experiment refuting the Aristotelian\ntheory of fall, according to which the speed of a body\u2019s fall is\nproportional to its weight. In this \u201cshort and conclusive\u201d\nargument, Galileo supposes that two bodies, one heavier than the\nother, are suddenly conjoined in the midst of falling. On the one\nhand, if Aristotle is correct, the faster fall of the heavier body\nwill be retarded by the slower motion of the lighter body, so that the\nconjoined body will fall slower than the original heavy body. And yet,\nthe conjoined body is heavier than either original body, so it should\nalso fall faster. Hence, there is a contradiction in the Aristotelian\nposition (Gendler 1998; Palmieri 2005; Brown and Fehige 2019).\n\nGalileo\u2019s second new science, in Days Three and Four of the Two\nNew Sciences, deals with the mathematical description of local motion\nand the laws governing it. This is now the motion of all matter, not\njust sublunary stuff, and the treatment takes the categories of time\nand acceleration as basic. Here is where Galileo enunciates his law of\nfree fall, the parabolic path of projectiles, and other physical\n\u201cdiscoveries\u201d that would lay the foundation for modern\nphysics (Drake 1999, v. 2).\n\nIn the projected Fifth Day, Galileo would have treated the power of\nmoving matter to act by impact, which he calls the force of\npercussion. Ultimately, Galileo was unable to give mathematical\nprinciples of this kind of interaction, but this problem subsequently\nbecame an important locus of interest. Ren\u00e9 Descartes, probably\nfollowing Isaac Beeckman, would eventually convert the problem into\nthe task of finding equilibrium between the forces conserved by\ncolliding bodies. Descartes\u2019s own mathematical treatment was\nmistaken, but correct principles were given in 1668\u20139 by\nChristiaan Huygens, John Wallis, and Christopher Wren.\n\nThe sketch above provides the basis for understanding Galileo\u2019s\ncareer. He offered a new science of matter, a new physical\ncosmography, and a new science of local motion. In all these, he used\na mathematical mode of description based upon, though somewhat changed\nfrom, the proportional geometry of Book VI of Euclid\u2019s\nElements and of Archimedes (for details on the changes, see\nPalmieri 2001).\n\nIt is in this way that Galileo developed the categories of the\nmechanical new science, the science of matter and motion. His new\ncategories utilized some of the basic principles of traditional\nmechanics, to which he added the category of time and so emphasized\nacceleration. But throughout, he was working out the details about the\nnature of matter so that it could be understood as uniform and\nuniversal, and treated in a way that allowed for coherent discussion\nof the principles of motion. It was due to Galileo that a unified\nmatter became accepted and its nature became one of the problems for\nthe new science that followed. After him, matter really mattered.\n4. Galileo and the Church\n\nNo account of Galileo\u2019s importance to philosophy can be complete\nif it does not discuss the Galileo Affair\u2014the sequence of\ninteractions with the Church that resulted in Galileo\u2019s\ncondemnation. The end of the affair is simply stated. In late 1632, in\nthe aftermath of the publication of the Dialogue Concerning the\nTwo Chief World Systems, Galileo was ordered to appear in Rome to\nbe examined by the Congregation of the Holy Office; i.e., the\nInquisition. In January 1633, a very ill Galileo made an arduous\njourney to Rome. From April, Galileo was called four times to\nhearings; the last was on June 21. The next day, June 22, 1633,\nGalileo was taken to the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, and\nordered to kneel while his condemnation was read. He was declared\nguilty of \u201cvehement suspicion of heresy,\u201d and made to\nrecite and sign a formal abjuration:\n\n\nI have been judged vehemently suspect of heresy, that is, of having\nheld and believed that the sun in the center of the universe and\nimmoveable, and that the Earth is not at the center of same, and that\nit does move. Wishing however, to remove from the minds of your\nEminences and all faithful Christians this vehement suspicion\nreasonably conceived against me, I abjure with a sincere heart and\nunfeigned faith, I curse and detest the said errors and heresies, and\ngenerally all and every error, heresy, and sect contrary to the Holy\nCatholic Church. (Quoted in Shea and Artigas 2003, 194)\n\n\nTradition, but not historical fact, holds that, after abjuring,\nGalileo mumbled, \u201cEppur si muove (and yet it\nmoves).\u201d He was sentenced to \u201cformal imprisonment at\nthe pleasure of the Inquisition,\u201d but this was commuted to house\narrest, first in the residence of the Archbishop of Siena, and then,\nfrom December 1633, at his villa in Arcetri. When he later finished\nhis last book, the Two New Sciences (which does not mention\nCopernicanism at all), it had to be printed in Holland, and Galileo\nprofessed amazement at how it could have been published.\n\nThe details and interpretations of these proceedings have long been\ndebated, and it seems that each year we learn more about what actually\nhappened. One point of controversy is the legitimacy of the charges\nagainst Galileo, both in terms of their content and the judicial\nprocedure. Galileo was charged with teaching and defending the\nCopernican doctrine that holds the sun is at the center of the\nuniverse and the Earth moves. The status of this doctrine was cloudy.\nIn 1616, an internal commission of the Inquisition had determined that\nit was heretical, but this was not publicly proclaimed. Instead,\nCopernicus\u2019s book had been placed on the Index of Prohibited\nBooks\u2014the list of books Catholics were forbidden to read\nwithout special permission\u2014with the status \u201csuspended\nuntil corrected.\u201d Even more confusingly, the\nrequisite corrections had appeared in 1620, but the book\nnevertheless remained on the Index until 1835. In fact, the\nChurch\u2019s first public pronouncement that Copernicanism\nis a heresy appears in Galileo\u2019s condemnation.\n\nGalileo\u2019s own status was also problematic. In 1616, at the same\ntime that the Inquisition was evaluating Copernicanism, they were also\ninvestigating Galileo personally\u2014a separate proceeding of which\nGalileo himself was not likely aware. The outcome was\nBellarmine\u2019s admonition not to \u201cdefend or hold\u201d the\nCopernican doctrine. This \u201ccharitable admonition\u201d may (or\nmay not) have been followed by a \u201cformal injunction\u201d\n\u201cnot to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatever, either\norally or in writing.\u201d When the records of this disposition of\nthe 1616 case were discovered in 1633, it made Galileo appear guilty\nof recidivism, having violated the Inquisition\u2019s injunction by\npublishing the Dialogue.\n\nTo confound issues further, the case against Galileo transpired in a\nfraught political context. Galileo was a creature of the powerful\nMedici and a personal friend of Pope Urban VIII, connections that\nsignificantly modulated developments (Biagioli 1993). There were also\npressures stemming from the Counter Reformation, the Thirty Years War,\nand resulting tensions within Urban\u2019s papacy (McMullin 2005;\nMiller 2008). It has even been argued (Redondi 1983), that the charge\nof Copernicanism was the effect of a plea bargain meant to cover up\nGalileo\u2019s genuinely heretical atomism, though this latter\nhypothesis has not found much support.\n\nThe legitimacy of the underlying condemnation of Copernicus on\ntheological and rational grounds is even more problematic. Galileo had\naddressed this problem in 1615, when he wrote his Letter to\nCastelli and then the Letter to the Grand Duchess\nChristina. In these texts, Galileo argues that there are two\ntruths: one derived from Scripture, the other from the created natural\nworld. Since both are expressions of the divine will, they cannot\ncontradict one another. However, Scripture and Creation both require\ninterpretation in order to glean the truths they\ncontain\u2014Scripture because it is a historical document written\nfor common people, and thus accommodated to their understanding so as\nto lead them towards true religion; Creation because the divine act\nmust be distilled from sense experience through scientific enquiry.\nWhile the truths are necessarily compatible, biblical and natural\ninterpretations can go awry, and are subject to correction.\n\nMuch philosophical controversy, before and after Galileo\u2019s time,\nrevolves around this doctrine of the two truths and their seeming\nincompatibility. Which of course, leads us immediately to such\nquestions as: \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d and \u201cHow is truth\nknown or shown?\u201d\n\nCardinal Bellarmine was willing to countenance scientific truth if it\ncould be proven or demonstrated (McMullin 1998). But Bellarmine held\nthat the planetary theories of Ptolemy and Copernicus (and presumably\nTycho Brahe) are only mathematical hypotheses; since they are just\ncalculating devices, they are not susceptible to physical proof. This\nis a sort of instrumentalist, anti-realist position (Machamer 1976;\nDuhem 1985). There are any number of ways to argue for some sort of\ninstrumentalism. Duhem (1985) himself argued that science is not\nmetaphysics, and so only deals with useful conjectures that enable us\nto systematize phenomena. Subtler versions of this position, without\nan Aquinian metaphysical bias, have been argued subsequently and more\nfully by Van Fraassen (1980) and others. Less sweepingly, it can\nreasonably be argued that both Ptolemy and Copernicus\u2019s theories\nwere primarily mathematical, and that Galileo was defending not\nCopernicus\u2019s theory per se, but the physical\nrealization of it. In fact, it might be better to say the Copernican\ntheory that Galileo was constructing was a physical realization of a\nsimplified version of Copernicus\u2019s theory, which dispensed with\nmany of the technical details (eccentrics, epicycles, Tusi couples and\nthe like). Galileo would be led to such a view by his concern with\nmatter theory, which minimized the kinds of motion ascribed uniformly\nto all bodies. Of course, when put this way, we are faced with the\nquestion of what constitutes identity conditions for a theory. Still,\nthere is clearly a way in which Galileo\u2019s Copernicanism is not\nCopernicus\u2019s.\n\nThe other aspect of all this that has been hotly debated is what\nconstitutes proof or demonstration of a scientific claim. Galileo\nbelieved he had a proof of terrestrial motion. This argument\nconcerning the cause of the tides is contained in On the Ebb and\nFlow of the Tides, a manuscript he composed in 1616 while\nCopernicanism was under the Inquisition\u2019s scrutiny, and the main\nthrust of which appears in Day Four of the Dialogue Concerning the\nTwo Chief World Systems.\n\nIn the first place, Galileo restricts the possible class of causes of\nthe tides to mechanical interactions, and so rules out Kepler\u2019s\nattribution of the cause to the moon. How could the moon cause the\ntides to ebb and flow without any connection to the seas? Such an\nexplanation would be an invocation of magic or occult powers. Thus,\nfor Galileo, the only conceivable (or maybe plausible) physical cause\nfor the regular reciprocation of the tides is the combination of the\ndiurnal and annual motions of the Earth. Briefly, as the Earth rotates\naround its axis, some parts of its surface are moving along with the\nannual revolution around the sun and some parts are moving in the\ncontrary direction. (In the same way that a point near the top of a\ncar\u2019s wheel is rotating in the same direction as the car is\nmoving, while a point near the ground is rotating toward the rear.) In\nthe frame of the fixed stars, this creates accelerations and\nretardations of the Earth\u2019s surface, and since the terrestrial\nwaters are not attached to the surface, they slosh back and forth as\ntheir basins speed up and slow down. Hence the tides. Moreover, since\nthe Earth\u2019s diurnal and annual rotations are regular, so are the\ntidal periods. Local differences in tidal flows are due to the\ndifferences in the physical conformations of the basins in which they\noccur (for background and more detail, see Palmieri 1998). Albeit\nmistaken, Galileo\u2019s commitment to mechanically intelligible\ncausation makes this is a plausible argument. One can see why Galileo\nthinks he has some sort of proof for the motion of the Earth, and\ntherefore for Copernicanism. \n\nYet one can also see why Bellarmine and the instrumentalists would not\nhave been impressed. First, they did not accept Galileo\u2019s\nrestriction of possible causes to mechanically intelligible causes.\nSecond, Galileo\u2019s explanation is not precise; it does not\naccount for many details of tidal motion. Most significantly, the\nmotion of the Earth\u2019s surface varies over twelve hours, not the\nsix-hour cycle of the tides. Third, the argument does not touch upon\nthe central position of the sun or arrangement of the planets as\ncalculated by Copernicus. So at best, Galileo\u2019s argument is an\ninference to the best partial explanation from a limited set of\nfeatures of Copernicus\u2019s theory. Meanwhile, there were\ncompelling considerations about the size of celestial bodies that\nweighed against the Copernican cosmology, stemming from a lack of\nunderstanding of the telescope\u2019s optics (Graney 2015).\n\nNevertheless, when the tidal argument is added to the earlier\ntelescopic observations that show the improbabilities of the older\ncelestial picture\u2014the fact that Venus has phases like the moon\nand so must revolve around the sun; the principle of the relativity of\nperceived motion which neutralizes the physical arguments against a\nmoving Earth; and so on\u2014it was enough for Galileo to believe\nthat he had the necessary proof to convince the doubters.\nUnfortunately, it was not until after Galileo\u2019s death and the\nacceptance of a unified material cosmology, utilizing the\npresuppositions about matter and motion that were published in\nthe Two New Sciences, that people were ready for\nsuch proofs. But this could occur only after Galileo had changed the\nacceptable parameters for gaining knowledge and theorizing about the\nworld.\n\nTo read many of the documents of Galileo\u2019s trial, see\nFinocchiaro 1989; Mayer 2012.
