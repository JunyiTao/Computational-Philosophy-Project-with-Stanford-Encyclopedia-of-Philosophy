    "main_text": "\n\nContemporary virtue epistemology (hereafter \u2018VE\u2019) is a\ndiverse collection of approaches to epistemology. At least two central\ntendencies are discernible among the approaches. First, they view\nepistemology as a normative discipline. Second, they view intellectual\nagents and communities as the primary focus of epistemic evaluation,\nwith a focus on the intellectual virtues and vices embodied in and\nexpressed by these agents and communities.\n\nThis entry introduces many of the most important results of the\ncontemporary VE research program. These include novel attempts to\nresolve longstanding disputes, solve perennial problems, grapple with\nnovel challenges, and expand epistemology\u2019s horizons. In the\nprocess, it reveals the diversity within VE. Beyond sharing the two\nunifying commitments mentioned above, its practitioners diverge over\nthe nature of intellectual virtues, which questions to ask, and which\nmethods to use.\n\nIt will be helpful to note some terminology before proceeding. First,\nwe use \u2018cognitive\u2019, \u2018epistemic\u2019 and\n\u2018intellectual\u2019 synonymously. Second, we often use\n\u2018normative\u2019 broadly to include not only norms and rules,\nbut also duties and values. Finally, \u2018practitioners\u2019 names\ncontemporary virtue epistemologists.\n",
