    "main_text": "The Ontology of Fictional Entities || .5 Quantificational arguments for realism\n2.2 Ontological Arguments for and Against Realism\n\nThe problems that one thus encounters in trying to let\nsemantic-linguistic arguments ground a commitment to fictional objects\ngive one reason to think that there is no semantical shortcut\navailable to the realist. That is to say, if a realist wants to claim\nthat our prima facie commitment to fictional entities is\njustified, she has to provide a genuine ontological argument to that\neffect.\n\nIn her 1999 book, Thomasson tried to provide just such an argument.\nHer argument claims that we cannot reject fictional objects if we\nadmit fictional works: given that fictional objects and fictional\nworks belong to the same genus of entities (the genus of created,\nartifactual objects) it would be false parsimony to accept the one and\nreject the other.\n\nThis argument has several problems. For one thing, it postulates an\nidentity of kind between fictional works and fictional entities that\nis far from intuitively clear. As Thomasson herself seems to admit\n(1999: 65), fictional works are syntactical-semantic entities, unlike\nfictional entities. But there is a similar argument that does not rely\non a parallelism between fictional works and fictional characters, but\non the fact that the identity conditions of the fictional works refer\nto fictional characters. In brief: if we admit a certain kind of\nentity, we cannot but admit all the other kinds of entities that\nfigure in the identity conditions of such an entity; we admit\nfictional works; so we cannot but also admit fictional objects because\nthey figure in the identity conditions of fictional works (cf.\nVoltolini 2003, 2006).\n\nIf the antirealist wants to challenge the realist on directly\nontological grounds, she has to discredit such arguments, and, better\nstill, provide an argument for the conclusion that there\ncannot be any fictional entities. Curiously enough, Russell,\nwho is usually remembered for having originated the\n\u2018paraphrase\u2019 strategy for eliminating apparent reference\nto nonexistent entities (see 2.11 above), also used\nnon-linguistically-based ontological arguments against admitting such\nentities. In fact, there is good reason to believe that he took his\nmain argument against Meinong to be that Meinongian entities\nare apt to violate the law of noncontradiction (cf. Russell\n(1905a,b)). In his (2005) and (2013), Everett reprises and extends\nRussell\u2019s ontological criticisms so that they become a critique\nof fictional entities in particular. He provides a number of arguments\nthat are intended to show that, first, such entities may violate some\nbasic logical laws\u2014not only the law of noncontradiction, but\nalso the symmetry of identity\u2014and, second, they may be\nproblematically indeterminate with respect to both their existence and\nidentity. These arguments are based on odd but intelligible stories in\nwhich, for example, one individual is both identical to and distinct\nfrom another, or in which it is indeterminate whether a certain\nindividual exists. The link to fictional characters is provided\nthrough certain bridging principles (more refined versions of such\nprinciples are provided in his 2013):\n\n(P1) If the world of a story concerns a creature a, and if\na is not a real thing, then a is a fictional\ncharacter.\n\n(P2) If a story concerns a and b, and if a\nand b are not real things, then a and b are\nidentical in the world of the story if and only if the fictional\ncharacter of a is identical to the fictional character of\nb.\n\nEverett\u2019s critique is interesting and innovative, and (given the\nworries expressed about language-focused arguments) in some ways a\nmodel of how an antirealist should really pursue the battle against\nwhat she believes are ontological illusions. But, not surprisingly,\nthe debate has not ended there. Although at least one influential\n(erstwhile) realist has conceded the power of Everett\u2019s\nargument, proposing an antirealist notion of assumption-relative truth\n(Howell 2011, 2015) in place of the realist absolute notion he\nchampioned earlier (Howell 1979), some other realists think that\nEverett underestimates the conceptual resources available to them.\n\n\nTake, for example, the case that seems to have exercised creationists\nthe most \u2014 the argument for indeterminate identity \u2014 and\nconsider an example like the following made-up nursery rhyme (from\nSchnieder & von Solodkoff 2009: 139):\n\nBah-Tale:\n\nThere once was a man called Bahrooh\n\nThere once was a man called Bahraah\n\nBut nothing determined if Bahraah was Bahrooh\n\nOr if they were actually two.\n\nGiven that \u201cBahraah\u201d and \u201cBahrooh\u201d are\nfictional names, it follows from (P1) and (P2) that it is\nindeterminate whether the fictional character Bahrooh is identical to\nthe fictional character Bahraah, contrary to philosophical consensus\nthat indeterminate identity is incoherent (see especially Evans 1980\nand the ensuing literature).\n\nPhilosophers of fiction have not been slow to respond to this\nargument. Few have been willing to accept fiction-generated ontic\nindeterminacy (Thomasson 2011 and Paganini 2023 are among the\nexceptions). Schnieder & von Solodkoff (2009) suggest that (P2)\nitself is to blame, and that there is a better default principle of\nidentity that lets story-relative ontic indeterminacy suffice for\ndeterminate ontic distinctness. Such a variation on (P2) would block\nBah-Tale from implying ontic indeterminacy, although some, siding with\nEverett, think the variation is ad hoc (Caplan & Muller\n2014). Others challenge the role played by principles of identity. Lee\n(2022), for example, argues that the identity of fictional characters\nis (usually) to be settled by appeal to authorial intentions rather\nthan principles of identity, and that this is enough to disarm alleged\nexamples of ontic determinacy. But even if we stress the importance of\nprinciples of identity, what such principles show may not be all that\nclear. One popular line of argument holds that Everett-style cases\nonly generate semantic, not ontic, indeterminacy (Thomasson 2011,\nCameron 2013, Woodward 2017). Some even think that an appeal to more\nor less familiar neo-Meinongian distinctions between i) predicative\nand propositional negation and ii) modes of predication\n(alternatively, kinds of property) is enough to block the inference to\nontic indeterminacy (Voltolini 2010). Of course, antirealists take\nsuch distinctions to be poorly understood and part of what makes\nrealism an unattractive option in the first place (they may also be\nunusable in complex fiction-involving sentences; see again Everett\n2013; for a reply, cf. Voltolini 2015b)). Hence even if such rebuttals\nare successful on their own terms, this is not likely to settle the\nrealism-antirealism debate.\n",
