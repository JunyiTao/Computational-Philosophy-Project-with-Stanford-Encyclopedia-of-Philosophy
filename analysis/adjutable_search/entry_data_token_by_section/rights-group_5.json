The critic\nmight argue that close inspection of particular rights commonly\nclaimed as group rights reveals either that they are not rights at all\nor that they dissolve into individual rights (e.g. Griffin 2008,\n256\u2013276; Lagerspetz 1998). However, much criticism is directed\nat the very idea of group rights. That criticism is generally of two\nsorts: either it is sceptical of the claim that groups can hold rights\nor it is fearful of the implications or consequences of ascribing\nrights to groups.\n\nSceptics often object to the ontology of groups they take to be\nimplicit in the idea of group rights. To suppose that groups, like\nindividual persons, can hold rights is to suppose that groups can have\na being and an integrity that match those of individual persons. But\ngroups are collections of individuals and to make them out to be\nsupra-human entities that are somehow more than, or other than, the\nsum of their parts is mistaken: \u201conly individuals can make\ndecisions, can literally have values, literally engage in reasoning\nand deliberation\u201d (Narveson 1991, 334). Those who make and\nadminister the law may have good reason to create and to operate with\nfictions, such as the legal fiction of corporate personality. But\nmoral rights and duties can attach only to real persons;\n\u201cfictitious entities have no rights\u201d (Graff 1994, 194).\nGroups do not exist separately from their members and, when we ascribe\nrights to groups as such, we ignore that simple truth. (Narveson 1991,\n331\u20135; Wellman 1995, 157\u201377; cf Vincent 1989).\n\nDoubts about the integrity of groups are sometimes sociological rather\nthan ontological. Generally, we might suppose that the groups to which\nwe ascribe rights have a unity and identity that is independent of,\nand that provides the foundation for, our ascription of rights to\nthem. A group, such as an ethnic or cultural group, has a certain\n\u201cnatural\u201d existence and we recognise it as having rights\nbecause of the kind of existent it is. In reality, however,\npre-institutionalised groups are shifting and changing entities and\nlack clear boundaries. In addition, any section of humanity that we\nmight fasten upon as a group is likely to be part of a larger\nsociological entity, and to have within it smaller entities, that\nmight also claim to be \u201cgroups\u201d. So there can be a\nsignificant element of arbitrariness about the segments of humanity\nthat we identify as \u201cgroups\u201d. We may suppose that, in\nascribing rights to a group, we merely acknowledge the entitlements of\na pre-existing entity, but, in reality, it may be the ascription of\nrights itself that identifies, creates and fixes a segment of humanity\nas a \u201cgroup\u201d. (Flanagan 1985; Kukathas 1992, 110\u201315;\nMitnick 2006; Offe 1998, 125\u201331; Waldron 2002. Cf. Mello 2004;\nSharp 1999.)\n\nGroups may be found improper subjects of rights because they lack\nproperties, other than genuine integrity, that are deemed essential\nfor right-holding. As we have seen, proponents of the interest theory\nof rights are able to view group rights more generously than those who\nadhere to the choice theory, although the supposition that groups can\nhave interests has not gone unchallenged (Wall 2003, 273). Choice\ntheorists can extend rights to organised groups that possess\ndecision-procedures (Preda 2012; Sumner 1987, 209\u2013211), but some\nargue that even those groups are incapable of the agency required for\nright-holding (Wellman 1995, 157\u201365; Wall 2000, 2003,\n270\u20136; cf. Nickel 1997). Again, if sentience is a necessary\ncondition of right-holding, that may disqualify groups as\nright-holders: \u201cgroups are composed of sentient individuals, but\nthey do not themselves feel anything\u201d (Rainbolt 2006, 208. See\nalso Kymlicka 1989, 241\u20132; Ellis 2005, 206\u20137. For a\ncontrary view, see Graham 2002, 89\u2013104).\n\nMore simply, sceptics often suppose that crediting groups with rights\nentails ascribing groups irreducible moral standing as groups, a\nstanding that the sceptics reject. They do not deny the reality of\ngroups or their significance for human life but insist that, insofar\nas these give rise to rights, those rights can be adequately conceived\nas rights held individually by the members of groups. Indeed, that\nmust be so, since only individual humans can possess moral standing\nand only they therefore can possess moral rights. Michael Hartney\n(1991), for example, asserts \u201cvalue-individualism\u201d, the\nview that \u201conly lives of individual human beings have ultimate\nvalue\u201d; collective entities derive whatever value they have from\ntheir contribution to the lives of individual human beings (297).\nValue-individualism, Hartney argues, precludes the possibility of\nmoral group rights (see also Ellis 2005; Kukathis 1991; Narveson\n1991).\n\nFor the most part, scepticism about group rights presupposes a\ncorporate conception of those rights. It challenges claims that a\ngroup might have a being, status or value that is not reducible to\nthat of its members. But, since the collective conception makes none\nof those claims, it is largely untouched by that scepticism. It is\nnot, however, exempt from other sorts of objection.\n",
