    "main_text": "\n\n\nAlthough better known today for his bold metaphysics and optimistic\ntheodicy, Leibniz\u2019s intellectual contributions extended well\nbeyond what is now generally thought of as philosophy or theology.\nRemarkably in an era that knew the likes of Galileo, Descartes,\nHuygens, Hooke and Newton, Leibniz stood out as one of the most\nimportant figures in the development of the Scientific Revolution.\nThis entry will attempt to provide an overview of the central themes\nof Leibniz\u2019s philosophy of physics broadly understood, as well\nas an introduction to some of the principal argumentative strategies\nhe used to defend his positions. The merits of Leibniz\u2019s\ncriticisms, contributions, and their relations to his larger\nphilosophical system remain fascinating areas for historical and\nphilosophical investigation.\n",
