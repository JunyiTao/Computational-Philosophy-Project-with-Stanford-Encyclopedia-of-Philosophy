Revisiting Biological Complexity\n\nEngineering is often promoted through the idea of rational design.\nSome synthetic biologists have adopted a similar vision of synthetic\norganisms as structures that can be assembled via replaceable and\nstandardized components, akin to Lego-bricks (front cover of\nScience, 2 September 2011 [333(6047)]). Yet, philosophers\nhave argued that the actual research practices in synthetic and\nsystems biology paint a different picture (Knuuttila & Loettgers\n2013a, 2014).\n",
