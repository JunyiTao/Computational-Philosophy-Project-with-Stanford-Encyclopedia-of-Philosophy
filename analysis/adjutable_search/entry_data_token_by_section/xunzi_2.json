Modes of Moral Self-Cultivation: Ritual (li \u79ae) and Music (yue \u6a02)\n\nWhat prompted Xunzi to dissent from Mencius\u2019s characterization\nof xing as good if he ultimately agreed with Mencius\u2019s\nlarger view: that people can perfect themselves and that such an\nachievement requires great exertion and self-motivation? Perhaps Xunzi\nwished to highlight his conviction that the proper models for moral\nbehavior lie outside the self, which is fundamentally opposed to a\nMencian notion of Four Beginnings (siduan \u56db\u7aef)\nlodged within the human heart (e.g., Mencius 2A.6). Whereas\nMencians have always emphasized looking inwards for moral\ndirection\u2014sometimes complicated by the acknowledgment that the\nheart can be corrupted\u2014self-cultivation in the Xunzian style is\ninconceivable without looking outwards.\n\nXunzi held that for most ordinary people, the best guide is the set of\nrituals (li) handed down by sages of yore (sheng\n\u8056 or shengren \u8056\u4eba). What are rituals and\nwhy did the sages institute them? In some passages, Xunzi attributes,\nin a manner superficially reminiscent of Hobbes or Rousseau, the\ngenesis of the rituals to the sages\u2019 recognition that unbridled\ncompetition produces a globally unsustainable situation: \n\n\nIf people follow their desires, then boundaries cannot contain them\nand objects cannot satisfy them. Thus the Former Kings restrained them\nand established for them ritual and morality in order to divide them\n[into classes]. (Xunzi 4.12; cf. 19.1a) \n\n\nSometimes these rituals are described as efficient social conventions\n(e.g., Perkins 2014: 189\u201397), but this is inadequate for two\nreasons.\n\nFirst, Xunzi elsewhere explicitly denies that an arbitrarily chosen\nset of rituals would be effective. Rather, the rituals of the sage\nkings are legitimate because they accord with \u201cthat which makes\nhumans human\u201d (ren zhi suoyi wei ren zhe\n\u4eba\u4e4b\u6240\u4ee5\u70ba\u4eba\u8005); by\nimplication, any competing ritual code would necessarily fail.\nSpecifically, human beings, unlike any other species of animal, abide\nby certain distinctions (bian \u8fa8)\u2014male is\ndistinguished from female, old from young, and so on\u2014and it is\naltogether natural that we do so. The rituals of the sage kings\nconfirm the distinctions that we are bound to make by nature (the core\ntext is Xunzi 5.4; see also 10.3a and 19.1c).\n\nSecond, rituals, in Xunzi\u2019s conception, not only facilitate\nsocial cohesion, but also foster moral and psychological development\n(Ivanhoe 2014; Yearley 2014: 92\u2013101). Indeed, if they did not,\nthey would be mere instruments of expedience, not rituals. These\ndimensions become clear when Xunzi begins to discuss specific rituals\nand their purposes. We observe regulations concerning funerary\nceremonies and grave goods, for example, in order to learn how to\navoid incivility and miserliness (19.4a-b). Similarly, the mandatory\nthree-year mourning period for deceased rulers and parents helps us\nconduct ourselves properly by providing suitable forms for us to\nexpress emotions that are so deep as to be potentially debilitating:\n\n\n\nWhen a wound is colossal, its duration is long; when pain is profound,\nthe recovery is slow. The three-year mourning period is a form\nestablished with reference to emotions; it is the means by which one\nconveys the acme of one\u2019s pain. (Xunzi 19.9a)\n\n\nOne ritual discussed in extenso is the village wine-drinking\nceremony (xiang \u9109). The fact that the host fetches the\nguest of honor himself, but expects the other guests to arrive on\ntheir own, underscores the distinctions that need to be drawn between\nnoble and base. And the detail that each participant toasts the next,\nserially and according to their ages, demonstrates that one can align\nsociety according to seniority without excluding anyone. When the\nguest of honor retires, the host bows and escorts him out, and the\nformal occasion comes to an end: this is to make it known that one can\nfeast at leisure without becoming disorderly. The clear implication is\nthat by taking part in the rite, we can gradually comprehend the moral\nprinciples that the sages wished us to embody (Xunzi\n20.5).\n\nXunzi\u2019s rituals have such an important role to play in our\nemotional and moral development that he spends an entire chapter\nlimning what are essentially rituals of artistic expression. The term\nhe uses is \u201cmusic\u201d (yue), which is distinct from\nritual, but Xunzi\u2019s conception of their origin and purpose is so\nsimilar that we can scarcely speak of one without the other. Thus\n\u201critual and music\u201d (liyue) can only be understood\nas two aspects of human artifice (wei): \u201critual\u201d\nrefers to cultural forms that affect social cohesion,\n\u201cmusic\u201d to those involving the orderly expression of human\nemotions. The crucial point is that the sages created both.\n\nLike all Confucians, Xunzi accepts that human beings have certain\nirrepressible impulses (Xunzi 20.1), which are not\nobjectionable in themselves. The problem is that unreflective\noutbursts driven solely by emotional responses may cause harm, and\nthus we are enjoined to be mindful of our impulses, rather than to\nextinguish them (compare Xunzi 22.5a). To aid us in this\nprocess, the Sages left behind appropriate musical compositions that\nwe can use to channel our need to express ourselves. What Xunzi meant\nby this is the canonical collection of Odes (Shi\n\u8a69), which all Confucians seem to have regarded as a nonpareil\nrepository of edifying literature (Goldin 2005: 35).\n\nXunzi\u2019s immediate purpose in this section was to counter the\nMohist view that music is wasteful. Xunzi counters that by focusing\nexclusively on the material costs, Mo Di \u58a8\u7fdf (d. ca. 390\nBCE) and his followers failed to recognize the psychological utility\nof music as an instrument of moral suasion (Cook 1997: 21\u201324;\nGraham 1989: 259\u201361). \n\n\nWhen music is centered and balanced, the people are harmonious and not\ndissipated. When music is stern and grave, the people are uniform and\nnot disorderly. When the people are harmonious and uniform, the army\nis firm and the citadels secure; enemy states dare not invade.\n(Xunzi 20.2)\n\n\nAs the last quote intimates, the proper implementation of ritual is\nalso decisive in politics and international\n relations.[6]\n In the \u201cDebate about Warfare\u201d, for example, Xunzi offers\na distinctive variant of the old Confucian idea that a true king\n(wang \u738b\u2014always a moral term in Confucian\ndiscourse) will succeed on the battlefield without even having to\nfight, because the populace will not support a tyrant or hegemon\n(ba \u9738, a lord who rules by brute force). What is\nunique is Xunzi\u2019s emphasis on ritual as the key to a\nwell-ordered state. To be sure, earlier writings had also discussed\nthe idea of ritual as the foundation of statecraft, and the Zuo\nCommentary to the Springs and Autumns (Zuozhuan\n\u5de6\u50b3), in particular, is famous for its scenes in which a\nruler who is about to attack his neighbor publicly justifies his\naggression on the grounds that he is merely \u201cpunishing\u201d\nhis enemy\u2019s intolerable violations of ritual. But Xunzi raises\nthe significance of ritual to a new level: in his view, the\nruler\u2019s ability to govern his state in accordance with ritual is\nthe sole criterion that will determine success or failure on the\nbattlefield (Xunzi 15.1c; see also Xunzi 16.1).\n\nHaving established that \u201cexalting ritual\u201d (longli\n\u9686\u79ae) is the true path to order and strength, Xunzi\nexpatiates in characteristic language: \n\n\nWhen kings and dukes follow [the rituals], that is how they obtain the\nworld; when they do not follow them, that is how they bring about the\nperdition of their altars of soil and grain. (Xunzi 15.4)\n\n\n\nEven advanced military technology is no match for a king who\n\u201cexalts ritual and esteems morality\u201d.\n\nAccordingly, in two passages assessing the mighty state of Qin\n\u79e6\u2014which would go on to unify the Chinese world under the\ninfamous First Emperor (r. 221\u2013210 BCE)\u2014Xunzi acknowledged\nits power but diagnosed a correctible weakness: it lacked schooled\nmoral advisors (like himself) to guide the ruler and save him from\nself-defeating avarice and aggression. Such counselors, moreover,\nshould have a Confucian orientation (Xunzi 8.2\u201310 and\n16.4\u20136). The judgment of most ancient writers is that Qin never\ncorrected this weakness.\n",
