The first two are\nstraightforward; the second two are more technical, and can be found\nby following the link to footnote 9.\n\n1. Undefined probability for God\u2019s existence. Premise 1\npresupposes that you should have a probability for\nGod\u2019s existence in the first place. However, perhaps you could\nrationally fail to assign it a probability\u2014your\nprobability that God exists could remain undefined. We cannot\nenter here into the thorny issues concerning the attribution of\nprobabilities to agents. But there is some support for this response\neven in Pascal\u2019s own text, again at the pivotal claim that\n\u201c[r]eason can decide nothing here. There is an infinite chaos\nwhich separated us. A game is being played at the extremity of this\ninfinite distance where heads or tails will turn up\u2026\u201d The\nthought could be that any probability assignment is inconsistent with\na state of \u201cepistemic nullity\u201d (in Morris\u2019 1986\nphrase): to assign a probability at all\u2014even 1/2\u2014to\nGod\u2019s existence is to feign having evidence that one in fact\ntotally lacks. For unlike a coin that we know to be fair, this\nmetaphorical \u2018coin\u2019 is \u2018infinitely far\u2019 from\nus, hence apparently completely unknown to us. Perhaps, then,\nrationality actually requires us to refrain from assigning a\nprobability to God\u2019s existence (in which case at least the\nArgument from Superdominance would apparently be valid). Or perhaps\nrationality does not require it, but at least permits it.\nEither way, the Wager would not even get off the ground.\n\n2. Zero probability for God\u2019s existence. Strict atheists\nmay insist on the rationality of a probability assignment of 0, as\nOppy 1990 among others points out. For example, they may contend that\nreason alone can settle that God does not exist, perhaps by\narguing that the very notion of an omniscient, omnipotent,\nomnibenevolent being is contradictory. Or a Bayesian might hold that\nrationality places no constraint on probabilistic judgments beyond\ncoherence (or conformity to the probability calculus). Then as long as\nthe strict atheist assigns probability 1 to God\u2019s non-existence\nalongside his or her assignment of 0 to God\u2019s existence, no norm\nof rationality has been violated.\n\nFurthermore, an assignment of \\(p = 0\\) would clearly block the route\nto Pascal\u2019s conclusion, under the usual assumption that\n\n\\[ \\infty \\times 0 = 0 \\]\n\n\nFor then the expectation calculations become: \n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{E}(\\text{wager for God}) &= \\infty \\times 0 + f_1 \\times(1 - 0) \\\\\n &= f_1 \\\\\n &\\\\\n \\mathrm{E}(\\text{wager against God}) &= f_2 \\times 0 + f_3 \\times(1 - 0) \\\\\n &= f_3 \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nAnd nothing in the argument implies that \\(f_1 \\gt f_3\\). (Indeed,\nthis inequality is questionable, as even Pascal seems to allow.) In\nshort, Pascal\u2019s wager has no pull on strict\n atheists.[9]\n",
