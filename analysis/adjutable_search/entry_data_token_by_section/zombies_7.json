    "main_text": "Does conceivability entail possibility? || Objections based on a posteriori necessity\n5.1 Objections based on a posteriori necessity\n\nA number of philosophers argue that Kripke\u2019s ideas about a\nposteriori necessary truth facilitate the defense of physicalism. They\nurge that even if a zombie world is conceivable, that does not\nestablish it is possible in the way that matters. Conceivability is an\nepistemic notion, they say, while possibility is a metaphysical one:\n\u2018It is false that if one can in principle conceive that P, then\nit is logically possible that P; \u2026 Given psychophysical\nidentities, it is an \u2018a posteriori\u2019 fact that any physical\nduplicate of our world is exactly like ours in respect of positive\nfacts about sensory states\u2019 (Hill and McLaughlin 1999, 446. See\nalso Hill 1997; Loar 1990/1997; 1999; McLaughlin 2005; Webster 2006).\nSome philosophers reject even the assumption that conceivability is a\nguide to possibility, challenging the view that the burden of\nproof is on those who deny the zombie possibility (Block and Stalnaker\n1999; Hill and McLaughlin 1999; Yablo 1993).\n\nChalmers has responded in several places (1996, 131\u2013134; 1999,\n476\u20137; 2010, 141\u2013205). His most detailed version of the\nconceivability argument (2010) uses the framework of two-dimensional\nsemantics. This enables him to distinguish two kinds of possibility\nand two corresponding kinds of conceivability. In the\n\u2018primary\u2019 sense conceivability entails possibility; for\nexample it is conceivable that water should have been a substance\nchemically different from H2O. In the other, \u2018secondary\u2019\nsense, it is neither conceivable nor possible that water should have\nbeen chemically different. The difficulty for the conceivability\nargument can be expressed by saying that even if zombie worlds are\nprimarily conceivable and therefore primarily possible, it does not\nfollow that they are also secondarily possible. And a posteriori\nphysicalists will typically deny that it follows, on the ground that\nonly the secondary possibility of zombie worlds would entail the\nfalsity of physicalism. At this point Chalmers in effect presents his\nopponents with a dilemma, which is (crudely summarizing his\nconclusions) that either the primary conceivability of zombies does\nafter all entail their secondary possibility, in which case the\nconceivability argument works and materialism is false; or else\n\u2018Russellian monism\u2019, briefly considered at Section 5.3\nbelow, is true.
