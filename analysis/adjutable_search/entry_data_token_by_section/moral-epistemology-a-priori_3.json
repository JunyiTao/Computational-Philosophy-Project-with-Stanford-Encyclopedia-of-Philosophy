    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Synthetic A Priori Moral Truths\n2. Kant\u2019s Synthetic A Priori Moral Truths\n\nFor Kant, there is a close connection between the nature of moral\ntruths\u2014in particular, their prescriptive content (i.e., what\nthey direct one to do), as well as their necessity and\nuniversality\u2014and the way in which we discover those truths,\nnamely, a priori. In his view, one can discover a maximally\ngeneral, fundamental moral principle. This is a principle that he\ncalls \u201cthe categorical imperative\u201d. Kant holds it can be\nknown through reason alone, specifically, via a transcendental\nargument (see entries on\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy\n and\n transcendental arguments).\n He held that we could then deduce more specific, but still general\nmoral truths from this fundamental principle. Kant provides various\nformulations of the categorical imperative, the first being that one\nought to act only in accordance with a\n maxim[3]\n that one can at the same time will to become a universal\nlaw\u2014roughly, an act ought to be done by someone only if the\nperson could will, without contradiction, that everyone act as he or\nshe is acting. Examples of more specific principles he deduces from\nthe categorical imperative are that one ought not make lying promises\nor commit suicide. Kant\u2019s discussion of lying promises nicely\nillustrates how the categorical imperative works: A person in some\ndifficulty is considering making a promise he knows he cannot keep to\nescape the difficulty. To apply the categorical imperative, the person\nmust consider what would happen if everyone in some difficulty made a\nlying promise to escape. If so many lying promises were made, no one\nwould believe a person who promised to do something, so under these\nconditions one could not escape a difficulty by making a promise.\nHence, the person could not consistently will that his maxim be a\nuniversal law, since making it a universal law would frustrate his aim\nin making the lying promise. Therefore, one ought not escape a\ndifficulty by making a lying promise.\n\nIn Book II of the Groundwork (1785 [1996]) Kant claims the fundamental\nmoral truths are synthetic a priori because moral truths are\nprescriptive. Kant held that the categorical imperative is not\nanalytic, because although Kant thought the applicability of the\ncategorical imperative to any given individual is deducible from the\nassumption that the individual is rational, the concept of the\ncategorical imperative is not contained in the concept of a rational\nbeing. Kant thought the categorical imperative must be discovered\na priori\u2014through reason\u2014because, as a fundamental\nmoral law applying to all rational beings, it cannot be discovered\nthrough mere experience: one cannot learn how one should act\nfrom how people do act.\n\nMoreover, we can see why Kant may have thought that the necessity and\nuniversality of moral truths makes them impossible to discover a\nposteriori. Regarding necessity: observing how things actually go\nseems insufficient to find out how they must go. And regarding\nuniversality: if moral truths are universal in the sense that they are\ntrue in all contexts, then one could only verify the truth of a moral\nclaim by (a) experiencing all contexts and (b) perceiving the moral\ntruth in each one. But that is clearly impossible.\n\nThus, on a standard reading of Book II, the prescriptive content of\nmoral claims, along with their necessity and universality, led Kant to\nbelieve we know moral truths only a priori. However,\nsome interpret Kant as saying that if a moral truth is a\npriori, then it must also be necessary and universal (Dancy 2007:\n45). On this interpretation, if one knows P a priori,\nthen P must be necessary; after all, it\u2019s unclear how one\ncould know a contingent truth without experience. Moreover, if\nP is necessary, then P must also be universal; for if\nP must be true, then it is true in every actual case. So, on\nthis interpretation, Kant\u2019s views about moral epistemology\nmotivate his views about the content of moral claims, not vice\nversa. Regardless of which interpretation is correct, it\u2019s\nclear Kant thought there is a close relationship between the content\nof moral claims and how we come to know them.\n\nAs we will see, moral particularists deny there is any such\nrelationship between the content of moral claims and the means by\nwhich we know them. Particularists claim that we can have a\npriori moral knowledge, even though all moral truths are\ncontingent and particular.\n\nHow, specifically, does Kant think that one can establish the\ncategorical imperative a priori? The crucial premise is that\npractically rational beings are autonomous, in the sense that their\nwills can be determined by rules they give themselves. Kant holds that\nthe law that an autonomous agent gives to herself must tell her\nwhich ends to pursue and not merely which means to\nemploy in light of the ends the agent already has. Kant therefore\nrejects the more orthodox conception of practical reason as purely\ninstrumental, i.e., limited to discovering the means to ends dictated\nby something else, e.g., desire. The question then becomes,\n\u201cWhat rule or law could determine the rational will apart from\nany end?\u201d that is, \u201cWhat rule could possibly tell a\nrational agent which ends to pursue?\u201d Such a rule would have to\nbe formal, since it could not simply tell the agent what to do in\nlight of the ends she already has, and thus could not include any\nspecification of an end. This leads Kant to the categorical\nimperative, roughly: for an agent to perform a moral action, the maxim\nthe agent acts on must be one that the agent can consistently will to\ngovern everyone, regardless of their goals, as a necessary law.\n",
