    "main_text": "Esse or Intelligere? Eckhart on God and Creation\n6. Esse or Intelligere? Eckhart on God and Creation\n\nPerhaps due to this pragmatic and multi-perspectival approach, Eckhart\nis not always entirely clear when it comes to the nature of God on\nwhich, if any, of the so-called transcendentals or divine\nperfections (being, truth/understanding, unity, or goodness) he takes\nto have conceptual or metaphysical priority. For example, in the\nopening sentence to the \u201cPrologue to the Book of\nPropositions\u201d in the Opus tripartitum, Eckhart appears\nto follow his Dominican predecessor Thomas Aquinas in giving\nbeing place of priority\u2014though he subtly reverses\nThomas\u2019s emphasis on the idea that God is being itself,\nasserting instead: Esse est deus (Prol. op. prop.\nn.11; LW I/2:29; PQP 93). Elsewhere, he speaks of God as\n\u201cexistence itself\u201d (In Exod. n.21; LW II:28; TP\n48), or as \u201cthe fullness of all existence [plenitudo omnis\nesse]\u201d, which \u201ccan have nothing outside of it\u201d\n(ibid. n.48; LW II:52; TP 58). However, in the first of the\nParisian Questions, Eckhart boldly states that\n\n\nit is not my present opinion that God understands because he exists,\nbut rather that he exists because he understands. God is an intellect\nand understanding [intellectus et intelligere], and his\nunderstanding itself is the ground of his existence. (Qu.\nPar. 1 n.4; LW V:40; PQP 45)\n\n\nIn fact, not only does Eckhart claim here that \u201camong [the]\nperfections intelligence comes first and then being or\nexistence\u201d (ibid. n.6; LW V:43; PQP 47), he claims that\n\u201ceverything in God transcends existence\u201d (ibid.\nn.8; LW V:44; PQP 48) and that \u201cnothing in him has the nature of\nbeing\u201d (ibid. n.10; LW V:46; PQP 49).\n\nThese seemingly inconsistent statements themselves correspond to two\nways the Meister discusses God\u2019s creation of the universe and\nthe status of the creatures that emerge from God\u2019s creative act.\nThe first involves what Bernard McGinn (2001, 2005), following Alain\nde Libera (1990), has called a metaphysics of flow, involving\na sort of \u201cspilling over\u201d of the divine plenitude of being\ninto creation. The second\u2014perhaps best described as a form of\ncausative epistemology\u2014maintains that the\ndivine\u2019s thinking or knowing all things is what both formally\ngrounds and efficiently causes those things to come to be. The former\naccount of creation, in which Eckhart commonly uses maternal metaphors\nto represent creation as a kind of ontological \u201cemanation\u201d\nfrom the \u201cpregnant\u201d Godhead (McGinn 2001: 84\u201385), is\ncommonly cited in discussions of the Meister\u2019s\n\u201cmystical\u201d Neoplatonism. The latter account, in contrast,\nis sometimes invoked by contemporary scholars to highlight the\nDominican\u2019s adherence to a form of Aristotelian intellectualism\nand his commitment to the doctrine of the primacy of intellect over\nwill (or, for Eckhart, even over being itself). To see how Eckhart can\nconsistently maintain both views, it will be important to more closely\nexamine both his doctrine of analogy and his understanding of the role\nof the divine logos as an intermediary between God and\ncreature. First, however, it will help to take a brief look at each of\nthese accounts on their own.\n",
