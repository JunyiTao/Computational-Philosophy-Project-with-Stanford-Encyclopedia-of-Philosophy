    "main_text": "The Revolution in France\n9. The Revolution in France\n\n\nBurke\u2019s name is indissolubly connected to his Reflections on the\nRevolution in France, though a more perceptive account of the\ncauses of the Revolution of 1789 can be found in A Letter to\nWilliam Elliot (1795), and the Letters on a Regicide\nPeace (1795\u20137) investigate the character and consequences of the\nRevolution from 1791 in a more thoroughgoing way. In an important\nsense, however, the judgement of posterity is right for our purposes,\nbecause Reflections illustrates very clearly the central\nimportance of philosophy and \u2018philosophical\u2019 history for\nBurke\u2019s writing about one of the greatest changes of his day.\n\n\nThis is true, in the first place, in terms of insight.\nReflections was published on 1 November 1790, less than\neighteen months after the storming of the Bastille. The intervening\nperiod had been characterised by a mixture of popular violence and\npeaceable, if feverish political activity in France, as its absolute\nmonarchy gave way to a constitutional monarchy. A detached observer\nwould be unsure of the future\u2014whether destruction and violence\nwould predominate or whether an enduring constitutional order would\nemerge was a question which events had not answered. In the event, of\ncourse, the Revolution would be characterised by violence and\nconstitutional development alike at different times, but this was as\nunknowable in 1790 as it is obvious in the twenty-first century.\n\n\nBurke\u2019s Reflections may be divided (for the author did not\nprovide any formal divisions) into two portions of unequal length. Both\nof these are concerned with relations. The first portion, about\ntwo-thirds of the text, suggests that the French, in their enthusiasm\nfor the idea of liberty, had failed to understand that liberty was only\none amongst a range of benefits, all of which were required in\nmutual connexion for a life under civil government that was civilized\nin the proper sense. The results which flowed from this deficiency of\nunderstanding included constitutional arrangements which, because they\ndid not reflect an understanding of liberty that was subtle enough to\ngrasp that the liberty of the many was power, did not qualify popular\nsovereignty in a way that would restrain the demos\neffectively. As if an unrestrained populace was not bad enough, an\nunderstanding of life only in terms of liberty swept away preceding\nelaborations of our ideas. This mattered, because the refinement of\nideas had been a precondition of refinement of conduct and therefore of\nthe progress of society in many respects. One key instance of these was\nthe respectful treatment of women encouraged since the middle ages by\nChristian learning and by chivalry. But there was a newer philosophy:\n\u2018on this scheme of things, a king is but a man; a queen is but a\nwoman; a woman is but an animal; and an animal not of the highest\norder\u2019. The retrogression of humanity itself to animality was not\nfar in the future with \u2018a swinish multitude\u2019. The result,\nas people would no longer be moved by opinion, which had embodied\nrefined ideas, would be that they would need to be governed by force.\nForce, too, was the ultimate destination of the second portion of\nReflections. This suggested that the idea of equality had\nbeen connected only too pervasively with the institutional\narrangements of the judiciary, the legislative and the executive\npower\u2014and therefore had produced not the authority of command\nfrom a s strong government but institutionalised feebleness. At the\nsame time, the perverse results of equality in fiscal arrangements had\ncaused popular discontent and financial instability. The result was a\nsituation which could be controlled only by the force of the\nmilitary\u2014if, indeed, military order was sustainable when\nsoldiers had absorbed the idea of equality. France, it seemed, tended\ntowards either disintegration or the rule of force.\n\n\nBurke\u2019s philosophical repertoire and historical understanding thus\nprovided the structure of Reflections, and, perhaps more\nimportantly, suggested insights into the character of the Revolution.\nThe inattention of the revolutionaries to the relations that needed to\nbe comprised in a modern government, especially in connexion with\nliberty, was matched by the inappropriateness to a sovereign regime of\nstructuring its institutions around equality rather than around\neffective command. These insights suggested that a mis-structuring of\nthe new constitution proceeded from an inadequate philosophical\ngrasp. Such misunderstanding was matched by a failure to understand\nthe historical development which had produced the elaboration of ideas\nabout conduct that had underwritten government by opinion, and this\nfailure suggested that the Revolution would cause retrogression from\nthis civilized condition towards a less gentle way of proceeding, as\nwell as a less effective one. In other words, Burke\u2019s understanding of\nphilosophy, and of the history of Europe, conceived\n\u2018philosophically\u2019, provided grounds for making fundamental\nclaims about the Revolution.\n\n\nWhether Burke was right in these claims about the Revolution, of\ncourse, is another question, and one that can never be answered:\nFrench readers of Reflections could take its lessons to\nheart, and, anyhow, events have a way of modifying tendencies\nindependently of intention and interpretation. Indeed, none of this is\nto say that Reflections was intended as an academic work, or\neven an accurate factual statement, about the Revolution. It was\ncalculated to produce a practical result, which was to dissuade the\nBritish from admiring the Revolution and so to dampen any propensity\nthey might feel to imitate it: and thus to protect civilization in\nBritain. In the course of pursuing this goal, Burke was willing to\nsatirize the Revolution and its British sympathizers unmercifully in\norder to make them as unattractive as possible to any sane reader, and\nhe matched the satire with a panegyric on British social and political\narrangements.  There is, indeed, much in Reflections besides\nthe elements that have been emphasized here (and indeed much in\nBurke\u2019s later views on the Revolution which is not\nin Reflections): but without those elements neither the book nor\nBurke\u2019s understanding of the Revolution would have been\npossible.\n",
