    "main_text": "Influence || 18th-Century Presence\n5.2 18th-Century Presence\n\nThe discourse of natural law became the lingua franca of\n18th-century moral, political, and social (including economic \u2013\nHont 1987, 2005; Skinner 1995) thought (Haakonssen 2012; see section\n2.1 above, and \u201cNatural Law 1625\u20131850: Database\u201d in\nOther Internet Resources below). Pufendorf contributed much thereto by\ninitiating the self-referential genre of the \u2018history of natural\nlaw\u2019, wherein he located himself in relation to Grotius, Hobbes\nand other predecessors (Sample of Controversies [Specimen\ncontroversiarum], 1678, Ch. 1: \u201cOn the Origin and Progress\nof the Discipline of Natural Law\u201d; later included in Eris\nScandica (ES 1686). His modest beginning was much enlarged by\nBarbeyrac in \u201cAn Historical and Critical Account of the Science\nof Morality \u2026,\u201d the Preface to his 1706 translation of\nPufendorf\u2019s DJN (2005 [1729]), and by Pufendorf\u2019s German\nfriend and disciple, Christian Thomasius, in his Nearly Complete\nHistory of Natural Law (Paulo plenior historia juris\nnaturalis, 1719), as well as many others in the 18th century\n(Glafey 1965 [1739]; see Hochstrasser 2000, pp. 65\u201371). As in\nPufendorf himself, a major theme of the genre was that of sociality\n(sociability, benevolence), which was variously interpreted,\ncriticized, and defended in both secular and religious contexts\n(Chiodi 2009, Piirim\u00e4e and Schmidt 2015). The notion\u2019s\nappeal in the British domain \u2013 where a way had been prepared by\nRichard Cumberland (1632\u20131718, Cumberland 2005), whom Pufendorf\ncited repeatedly in the 1684 edition of DJN \u2013 is demonstrated by\nGershom Carmichael\u2019s (1672\u20131729) influential student\nedition (1718) of Pufendorf\u2019s De officio (Carmichael\n2002), and by the inaugural lecture \u201cOn the Natural Sociality of\nMen\u201d (1730) of his student and successor at Glasgow, Francis\nHutcheson (1694\u20131746), whose thought was strongly influenced by\nnatural law (Hutcheson 1993, 2006, 2007). So too were many other\nBritish moralists and social theorists, especially in the so-called\nScottish Enlightenment, including George Turnbull (1698\u20131748),\nJohn Millar (1735\u20131801), Thomas Reid (1710\u20131796), and Adam\nSmith (1723\u20131790) (Haakonssen 1996, Moore and Silverthorne 1983,\nMoore 2006). Through them and others, including direct exposure to\nPufendorf\u2019s own, often reprinted works, natural law thought also\nbecame part of the intellectual inheritance of the American Revolution\nand constitutionalism (Welzel 1952, White 1978, Augat 1985, Heideking\n1995, Haakonssen 1991, Logan 2013).\n\nOn the Continent, Pufendorf\u2019s influence was felt during the 18th\ncentury through the so-called civil enlightenment of C. Thomasius and\nhis school, and through the frequent republication and study of his\nown works. Their juridical approach to natural law persisted until the\nend of the century, especially in German law faculties (Lestition\n1989, Klippel 2009, Schr\u00f6der 2010), where it provided a\ncounterweight to the metaphysical, perfectionist, and in a sense\nneoscholastic tradition of natural law associated with Leibniz and\nChristian Wolff (1679\u20131754) (Hunter 2007, 2003a, 2001;\nLutterbeck 2002, Haakonssen 2006, Ikadatsu 2002, Ottmann 2006, Schmidt\n2007, Schneider 2001). Pufendorf himself maintained a presence not\nonly through his natural law works but also the historical writings,\nespecially the many versions of his Introduction (Einl.\n1682), which was continually revised and appropriated by others to\nsuit the times, until nearly the end of the century (Seidler 2013).\nIndeed, it was largely through this work and those of its editors,\ncommentators, and imitators, including Nikolaus Hieronymus Gundling\n(1671\u20131729) and Johann Peter Lud[e]wig (1668\u20131743), that\nPufendorf entered the 18th-century discourse about the relation of\nlaw, politics, and history, and stayed relevant as an international\ntheorist. His empirically grounded mix of history, philosophy, and law\nled also into cameralism (Br\u00fcckner 1977), into the so-called\nG\u00f6ttingen School (Hammerstein 1972 and 1986, Vierhaus 1987), and\nto the associated discipline of Statistik (statistics, from\nthe Italian statista [statesman] and ragion di\nstato), with its focus on the concrete institutions and functions\nof states (Zande 2010, Valera 1986, Pasquino 1986). This included\nGottfried Achenwall (1719\u20131772), on whom Kant lectured for many\nyears during both his pre-Critical and Critical periods (Achenwall\n1762, Hruschka 1986, Streidl 2000). Moreover, it underlay the\ncentury\u2019s legal codification schemes, which attempted still to\nbase positive on natural law in some sense (Hartung 1998, Ferronato\n2005). In an equally broad sort of way, Pufendorf was also predecessor\nto Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (1694\u20131748) and Emmerich de Vattel\n(1714\u20131767), whose respective works on natural and international\nlaw were notable examples of the genre, albeit ones also influenced by\nits Wolffian version. Moreover, Pufendorf and natural law were present\nin the Encyclop\u00e9die (Schr\u00f6der 2001, Burns 1999),\nas well as in the prehistory of the French Revolution (Caradonna 2006,\nEdelstein 2014). Finally, Pufendorf\u2019s theory of the state had a\nsignificant formative influence on specific thinkers like Rousseau,\nwho criticized him and other \u201cfriends of despotism\u201d for\nundermining human freedom while nonetheless borrowing heavily from his\npolitical conceptions (McAdam 1963, Derath\u00e9 1992, Wokler 1994,\nSilvestrini 2010, Douglass 2015).\n",
