    "main_text": "\n\nDiscussions of the nature of time, and of various issues related to\ntime, have always featured prominently in philosophy, but they have\nbeen especially important since the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury. This article contains a brief overview of some of the main\ntopics in the philosophy of time\u2014(1) fatalism; (2) reductionism\nand Platonism with respect to time; (3) the topology of time; (4)\nMcTaggart\u2019s argument; (5) the A-theory and the B-theory; (6)\npresentism, eternalism, and the growing block theory; (7) the 3D/4D\ndebate about persistence; (8) the dynamic and the static theory; (9)\nthe moving spotlight theory; (10) time travel; (11) time and physics\nand (12) time and rationality. We include some suggestions for further\nreading on each topic and a bibliography.\n\nNote: This entry does not discuss the consciousness, perception,\nexperience, or phenomenology of time. A historical overview and\ngeneral presentation of the various views is available in the entry on\n temporal consciousness.\n Further coverage can be found in the SEP entry on the\n experience and perception of time.\n For those interested specifically in phenomenological views, see the\nentries on\n Husserl\n (Section 6), and\n Heidegger\n (Section 2: Being and Time).\n",
