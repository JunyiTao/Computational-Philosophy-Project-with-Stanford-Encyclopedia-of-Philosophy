Merely referring to \u2018form and\ncolour\u2019 is unsatisfactory. For as Descartes pointed out, it is\nunclear how the 2-D shape of a mark on the surface of a painting or\ndrawing can resemble the 3-D shape of an object it depicts; and the\nuse of foreshortening shows that rhombuses can represent squares\nbetter than squares, ovals can represent circles better than circles,\nand so on ([1637] 1985: I 165). Furthermore, some pictures (for\ninstance, cubist paintings) do not bear much obvious resemblance to\nthe objects they depict in either form or colour. Hence, the basic\nidea that depiction depends on resemblances in form and colour will\nneed to be specified in such a way as to meet what Dominic Lopes calls\nthe diversity constraint (Lopes 1996: 32), in other words, it\nwill need to accommodate the wide variety of styles of picture-making.\nDifferent resemblance theorists have responded to these challenges in\ndifferent ways.\n\nJohn Hyman and Catherine Abell have proposed different theories of\ndepiction in which the idea of resemblance plays a significant role.\nHyman rejects the theory that pictures are iconic signs (2012: 127),\nbut he claims that there is a strict and invariable relationship\nbetween the shapes and colours on a picture\u2019s surface and the\nshapes and colours of the objects it represents. Hyman\u2019s theory\ndepends on Gottlob Frege\u2019s distinction between sense and\nreference (see \u00a73.2 of the  entry on\n Frege).\n Taking one of Frege\u2019s own examples, the phrases \u201cthe\nmorning star\u201d and \u201cthe evening star\u201d have the same\nreference, but different senses, or modes of presentation. Both\nphrases refer to one and the same object, the planet Venus, but they\ndescribe or present it as a star that is visible at different times of\nday. Similarly, two portraits of the same individual may present him\nas dark-haired and seated, wearing a black smock\n (Kramskoy\u2019s 1873 portrait of Tolstoy),\n or as grey-haired and standing, wearing a white smock\n (Repin\u2019s 1901 portrait).\n They portray (refer to) the same individual, but they present him\ndifferently (they differ in sense). The distinction matters, Hyman\nargues, because resemblances do not explain a picture\u2019s\nreference, they explain its sense. (The claim that A depicts\nB if and only if A appreciably resembles B, which\nGoodman criticizes, is about depiction qua portrayal, i.e.,\npictorial reference, not sense.)\n\nAccording to Hyman, the sense or mode of presentation of a picture,\nexpressed in the most general terms, is an aspect or view of an object\nor arrangement of objects, relative to an implicit point (or a variety\nof points) of view. (An \u201cobject\u201d in this sense is not\nnecessarily a \u201cmaterial object\u201d, it might be a shadow, a\nrainbow, or part of the sky.) Different parts of a picture can present\ndifferent aspects of an object or its parts, corresponding to\ndifferent points of view, but nothing can be depicted independently of\na point of view. Otherwise, Hyman points out,\n\n\n[we could] discover different aspects of an object represented in a\npicture by moving around it and studying it from different angles, as\nwe can in the case of a free-standing sculpture. (2012: 142)\n\n\nHyman\u2019s principal claim is that the sense or mode of\npresentation of a picture is defined by the colours and shapes of the\nmarks on its surface in accordance with definite optical principles\nconcerning colour and shape (2006: ch. 5; see also Hopkins 1998a: 27).\nWe shall concentrate on shape.\n\nHyman\u2019s shape-principle employs the concept of an object\u2019s\nocclusion shape, i.e., the 2-D cross-section of the cone of\nlight it subtends to a viewer\u2019s eye. (The concept is similar to\nHopkins\u2019s outline shape; see below,\n \u00a73.2.)\n For example, the occlusion shape of a circular coin viewed obliquely\nis an ellipse. This shape, Hyman argues, is a visible property of the\ncoin. It is especially salient when an object is backlit, and appears\nin silhouette. It is relative to a point of view, and changes as the\npoint of view changes. But Hyman insists that relative does not mean\nsubjective. An object\u2019s occlusion shape \u201cis not merely a\nfeature of the viewer\u2019s experience. It belongs to optics, not\npsychology\u201d (2012: 143; cf. Peacocke 1987). Hyman\u2019s\nshape-principle is that the shape of a region on a picture\u2019s\nsurface (or, in the case of anamorphic pictures, its occlusion shape\nrelative to the intended point of view of a spectator) is identical to\nthe occlusion shape of the object it represents, relative to the\nimplicit point of view. In other words, there is an exact resemblance\nbetween these shapes (2006: 81).\n\nAccording to Hyman, this principle captures an exact relationship\nbetween the marks on a picture\u2019s surface and the picture\u2019s\nsense, which does not depend on the artist\u2019s intention, or on\nthe picture\u2019s psychological effect on a spectator, and which\napplies to pictures regardless of their style or the artistic\ntradition to which they belong. Together with a principle concerning\ncolour, it is supposed to explain how the colours and shapes on the\nsurface of a picture fix the colours and shapes of the objects it\ndepicts. But Hyman\u2019s optical principles do not imply that a\nportrait of Tolstoy resembles Tolstoy, since they are only concerned\nwith a picture\u2019s sense, as opposed to its reference. Nor do they\nimply that a painting of a bearded man resembles a bearded man, since\nthey are only concerned with the shapes and colours of the objects in\na picture. Hyman therefore claims that his theory dovetails neatly\nwith the idea that a picture\u2019s reference is normally determined\nby the artist\u2019s intention, and with the idea that the depiction\nof objects of specific kinds, such as men and horses, depends on a\npicture\u2019s propensity to trigger a spectator\u2019s ability to\nrecognize these kinds of objects by their shapes and colours, and the\nshapes and colours of their parts (see below,\n \u00a73.2).\n He explains how these two elements of a theory of depiction can be\ncombined with the example of a silhouette:\n\n\nthe black shapes the silhouettist has cut out fix the occlusion shapes\nof the objects represented and their parts, relative to an implicit\nline of sight. And the spectator\u2019s ability to recognize, say, a\ngirl or a cat, enables him to see a girl or a cat depicted in a\nsilhouette by seeing its occlusion shape and the occlusion shapes of\nits parts. (2012: 113)\n\n\nHyman\u2019s theory has been criticised on various grounds. First,\nand most generally, Michael Podro argues that it expresses a bias in\nfavour of realistic or literal representation (Podro 2010: 457).\nHowever, Hyman replies that the optical principles he defines\n\u201cdo not dictate or limit the forms artists create, the models\nthey follow, or the values they embody in their work\u201d, any more\nthan English grammar limits the imagination of English poets (Hyman\n2012: 145). Second, it has been alleged that Hyman\u2019s theory\ncannot explain \u201cthe depiction of nonexistent objects\u201d\n(Abell 2009: 195). However, this objection depends on the questionable\nassumption that resemblance is invariably a relation between existing\nparticulars (see above\n \u00a71.1).\n Third, it has been argued that indeterminacies in the occlusion\nshapes of objects represented in a picture may not match the\nindeterminacies in the shapes of the parts of the picture that depict\nthem (Kulvicki 2014: 61\u201362). Finally, it has been argued more\ngenerally that the exact correspondences in shape and colour between\nthe surface of a picture and its content, which Hyman\u2019s theory\npredicts, sometimes break down; and that the correspondences which do\nexist depend on contingent features of the human visual system (Newall\n2006; Hyman 2007; Newall 2011).\n\nThe last objection reflects the most widely accepted reason for\nrejecting resemblance theories such as Hyman\u2019s, in which the\nbasic mechanism of depiction is defined without reference either to\nthe visual experience of a spectator, or to the changing cultural\ncontext in which pictures are made. Catharine Abell has defended a\nresemblance theory of depiction which differs from Hyman\u2019s in\nboth of these respects, and is designed to avoid the objections\nmentioned above. It is also a more ambitious theory, both because\nAbell does not distinguish between the sense and reference of a\npicture, but aims to explain both at once, and because she explains\nthe depiction of specific kinds of objects, such as men and horses, in\nterms of resemblance, instead of confining the scope of the theory to\nthe shapes and colours of the objects in a picture. Unlike Hyman,\nAbell does not specify which particular respects of resemblance are\nnecessary for depiction, beyond the requirement that they should be\nvisible (2009: 199), arguing instead that \u201cdifferent respects of\nresemblance govern different instances of depiction\u201d (2009:\n196), including resemblance in respect of optical properties, such as\nocclusion shape, and response-dependent properties, such as when\npainters mimic the effect of simultaneous contrast.\n\nDrawing on Paul Grice\u2019s seminal article \u201cMeaning\u201d\n(Grice 1957), Abell argues that the respects of resemblance governing\na particular picture depend on the artist\u2019s communicative\nintentions:\n\n\nA picture\u2019s resemblance to some object O in a given\nrespect(s) is relevant to determining what the picture depicts if its\nmaker intended the picture to resemble O in the relevant\nrespect(s) and thus to bring O to viewers\u2019 minds; and\nintended that these resemblances have this effect in part because\nviewers recognize that intention. (2009: 201; cf. Blumson 2009 and\n2014)\n\n\nAccording to Abell, a picture depicts some object O only if it\nresembles O in a range of relevant respects, and if it thereby\ncaptures O\u2019s \u201coverall appearance\u201d, enabling a\nspectator to distinguish it from objects for which it would not\nordinarily be mistaken (2009: 210). As noted above, Abell regards\npictures of objects that do not actually exist as problematic for\nresemblance theories of depiction. Her solution to the problem\ncombines two ideas: first, a picture of an object that does not\nactually exist, but could exist, such as a gold mountain,\nwould resemble the object, if it did exist; second, we can\nmake-believe that a fictional character such as Sherlock Holmes\nexists, and make-believe that a picture resembles him (2009:216).\n\nAbell argues that because she does not specify which particular\nrespects of resemblance are necessary for depiction, her theory is\nconsistent with the diversity constraint, in other words, it\naccommodates the wide variety of stylistic conventions that have\ndeveloped in different artistic traditions. However, it can be\nobjected that it fails to accommodate another alleged constraint on an\nadequate resemblance theory of depiction identified by Lopes, which he\ncalls the independence constraint. According to Lopes, a\nspectator must be able to perceive the resemblances postulated by a\nresemblance theory of depiction \u201cwithout first knowing\u201d\nwhat a picture represents (Lopes 2005a: 16\u201317). In fact, this\nobjection only applies to a theory which implies that a spectator\nperceives a certain kind of object in a picture by perceiving a\nresemblance between the marks on its surface and an object of\nthis kind, and a resemblance theory need not have this implication.\nHowever, Abell accepts that the objection applies to her own theory,\nespecially since she holds that the \u201crespects of\nresemblance\u201d that \u201cgovern\u201d a picture depend on the\nartist\u2019s communicative intentions, and that a spectator\u2019s\nknowledge of these intentions is gained, at least in part, from the\npicture itself. However, she addresses the objection by highlighting\nalternative, context-specific sources of information about them (Abell\n2005, 2009; cf. Blumson 2014).\n",
