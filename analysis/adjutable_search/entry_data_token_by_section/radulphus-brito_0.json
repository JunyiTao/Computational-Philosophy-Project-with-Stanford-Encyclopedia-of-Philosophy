Recent studies by\nWilliam Courtenay (2005) and Jean-Luc Deuffic (2002) significantly\nincreased our knowledge of his biography. He was born in the village\nof Ploudiry, in French Brittany, around 1270 and not later than 1273.\nHe was a master of arts in Paris from around 1290. He probably began\nthe study of theology in 1299, while still teaching in the faculty of\narts. He read Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences in 1308/09 and\nobtained his doctorate in theology in 1313/14. Brito became\n Provisor[1]\n of the Sorbonne at some point between 1312 and 1315 and kept this\nfunction until at least 1319. He also held several ecclesiastical\npositions, which is a good indication of both his prominence within\nthe university and excellent personal connections. Brito died in\n1320/21.\n",
