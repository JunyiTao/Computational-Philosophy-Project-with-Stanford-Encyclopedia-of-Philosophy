    "main_text": "Qualia\n1. Qualia\n\n\nQualia (singular \u2018quale\u2019), in a common modern usage, are\nproperties of experiences that type them in phenomenological respects.\nImagine seeing three colored patches against a neutral background in\ngood light, one after the other. In particular, imagine seeing a\nvermilion patch, then a crimson patch, and finally a turquoise patch.\n(Those with poor imaginations may consult Figure 1.)\n\n\nFigure 1:\nvermilion, crimson, and turquoise patches\n\n\n\nThree experiences of the imagined sort differ in their\nphenomenology, or in \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d to undergo them. What\nit\u2019s like to see the crimson patch is not the same as what it\u2019s like to\nsee the turquoise patch, for example. Further\u2014assuming you have\nnormal color vision\u2014seeing the crimson patch is more similar,\nin phenomenological respects, to seeing the vermilion patch than it is\nto seeing the turquoise patch.\n\n\nThus your experience of the crimson patch has a quale (call it\n\u2018\\(Q_{C}\\)\u2019) that your experiences of\nthe vermilion and turquoise patches lack. Your experience of the\nvermilion patch has a quale \\((Q_{V})\\) that your\nexperiences of the crimson and turquoise patches lack; likewise, your\nexperience of the turquoise patch has quale\n\\(Q_{T}\\). What about an experience of all three\npatches, as when viewing the whole of figure 1? Which of\n\\(Q_{C}, Q_{V}\\), and\n\\(Q_{T}\\) does that have? The answer usually\nimplicit in the literature is \u2018All three\u2019 (as opposed to\n \u2018None\u2019).[1]\n This is probably the more natural way of\nunderstanding qualia terminology, given the explanation so far, and is\nthe one adopted in this article.\n\n\nIn addition to the quale \\(Q_{C}\\), your\nexperience of the crimson patch has quale\n\\(Q_{R}\\) which it shares with your experiences\nof the vermilion patch, blood, fire trucks, strawberries, ripe\ntomatoes, and so on. Your experience of the turquoise patch (in\nisolation) lacks \\(Q_{R}\\).\n\n\nIt must be emphasized that\n\u2018\\(Q_{C}\\)\u2019, for example, is not\nexplicitly defined using color terminology.\n\u2018\\(Q_{C}\\)\u2019 is not stipulated to be\nan abbreviation of \u2018the property of being an experience of\nsomething\u2019s looking crimson\u2019, for instance. Rather, the role of\ndescriptions like the latter is simply to draw attention to the salient\nproperty that \u2018\\(Q_{C}\\)\u2019 is supposed\nto be a name for, in much the same way that one might introduce the\nunfamiliar name \u2018Eugene Cernan\u2019 by saying that it refers to\nthe last man to walk on the moon. In the jargon, the description\n\u2018the property of being an experience of something\u2019s looking\ncrimson\u2019 can be used to fix the reference of\n\u2018\\(Q_{C}\\)\u2019. (See the entry on\n reference.)\n\n\nQualia terminology can be introduced in a similar manner for other\nsorts of visual experiences (seeing differently shaped patches, for\ninstance), for other perceptual modalities, for bodily sensations, and\nfor thoughts, imagery, emotions, and so forth. It is controversial\nwhether some of these mental events/states have qualia\u2014in\nparticular, episodes of conscious thought, at least some of which seem\ndevoid of\n phenomenology.[2]\n\n\nOne might wonder why some special terminology is required.\nAdmittedly \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, for example,\nis not defined in terms of \u2018red\u2019, but isn\u2019t\n\\(Q_{R}\\) in fact the property of being an\nexperience of something\u2019s looking\n red?[3]\n And if it is, why\nintroduce another name? However, as discussed later (subsection 3.2),\nthere is an argument against this identification.\n",
