The idea of truth as a\ngraded notion has been applied to model vague predicates and to obtain\na solution to the Sorites Paradox, the Paradox of the Heap (see the\nentry on the\n Sorites Paradox).\n However, the success of applying many-valued logic to the problem of\nvagueness is highly controversial. Timothy Williamson (1994: 97), for\nexample, holds that the phenomenon of higher-order vagueness\n\u201cmakes most work on many-valued logic irrelevant to the problem\nof vagueness\u201d.\n\nIn any case, the vagueness of concepts has been much debated in\nphilosophy (see the entry on\n vagueness)\n and it was one of the major motivations for the development of\nfuzzy logic (see the entry on\n fuzzy logic).\n In the 1960s, Lotfi Zadeh (1965) introduced the notion of a fuzzy\nset. A characteristic function of a set \\(X\\) is a mapping which\nis defined on a superset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) and which indicates membership\nof an element in \\(X\\). The range of the characteristic function of a\nclassical set \\(X\\) is the two-element set \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) (which may be\nseen as the set of classical truth values). The function assigns the\nvalue 1 to elements of \\(X\\) and the value 0 to all elements of \\(Y\\)\nnot in \\(X\\). A fuzzy set has a membership function ranging over the\nreal interval [0,1]. A vague predicate such as \u2018is much earlier\nthan March 20th, 1963\u2019, \u2018is beautiful\u2019,\nor \u2018is a heap\u2019 may then be regarded as denoting a fuzzy\nset. The membership function \\(g\\) of the fuzzy set denoted by\n\u2018is much earlier than March 20th, 1963\u2019 thus\nassigns values (seen as truth degrees) from the interval [0, 1] to\nmoments in time, for example \\(g\\)(1p.m., August 1st, 2006)\n\\(= 0\\), \\(g\\)(3a.m., March 19th, 1963) \\(= 0\\),\n\\(g\\)(9:16a.m., April 9th, 1960) \\(= 0.005\\), \\(g\\)(2p.m.,\nAugust 13th, 1943) \\(= 0.05\\), \\(g\\)(7:02a.m., December\n2nd, 1278) \\(= 1\\).\n\nThe application of continuum-valued logics to the Sorites Paradox has\nbeen suggested by Joseph Goguen (1969). The Sorites Paradox in its\nso-called conditional form is obtained by repeatedly applying\nmodus ponens in arguments such as:\n\nA collection of 100,000 grains of sand is a heap.\nIf a collection of 100,000 grains of sand is a heap, then a\ncollection 99,999 grains of sand is a heap.\nIf a collection of 99,999 grains of sand is a heap, then a\ncollection 99,998 grains of sand is a heap.\n\u2026\nIf a collection of 2 grains of sand is a heap, then a collection\nof 1 grain of sand is a heap.\nTherefore: A collection of 1 grain of sand is a heap.\n\n\nWhereas it seems that all premises are acceptable, because the first\npremise is true and one grain does not make a difference to a\ncollection of grains being a heap or not, the conclusion is, of\ncourse, unacceptable. If the predicate \u2018is a heap\u2019 denotes\na fuzzy set and the conditional is interpreted as implication in\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s continuum-valued logic, then the Sorites\nParadox can be avoided. The truth-function \\(f_{\\rightarrow}\\) of\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s implication \\(\\rightarrow\\) is defined by\nstipulating that if \\(x \\le y\\), then \\(f_{\\rightarrow}(x, y) = 1\\),\nand otherwise \\(f_{\\rightarrow}(x, y) = 1 - (x - y)\\). If, say, the\ntruth value of the sentence \u2018A collection of 500 grains of sand\nis a heap\u2019 is 0.8 and the truth value of \u2018A collection of\n499 grains of sand is a heap\u2019 is 0.7, then the truth value of\nthe implication \u2018If a collection of 500 grains of sand is a\nheap, then a collection 499 grains of sand is a heap.\u2019 is 0.9.\nMoreover, if the acceptability of a statement is defined as having a\nvalue greater than \\(j\\) for \\(0 \\lt j \\lt 1\\) and all the conditional\npremises of the Sorites Paradox do not fall below the value \\(j\\),\nthen modus ponens does not preserve acceptability, because\nthe conclusion of the Sorites Argument, being evaluated as 0, is\nunacceptable.\n\nAlasdair Urquhart (1986: 108) stresses \n\n\nthe extremely artificial nature of the attaching of precise numerical\nvalues to sentences like \u2026 \u201cPicasso\u2019s\nGuernica is beautiful\u201d. \n\n\nTo overcome the problem of assigning precise values to predications of\nvague concepts, Zadeh (1975) introduced fuzzy truth values as\ndistinct from the numerical truth values in [0, 1], the former being\nfuzzy subsets of the set [0, 1], understood as true, very\ntrue, not very true, etc.\n\nThe interpretation of continuum-valued logics in terms of fuzzy set\ntheory has for some time be seen as defining the field of mathematical\nfuzzy logic. Susan Haack (1996) refers to such systems of mathematical\nfuzzy logic as \u201cbase logics\u201d of fuzzy logic and reserves\nthe term \u2018fuzzy logics\u2019 for systems in which the truth\nvalues themselves are fuzzy sets. Fuzzy logic in Zadeh\u2019s latter\nsense has been thoroughly criticized from a philosophical point of\nview by Haack (1996) for its \u201cmethodological\nextravagances\u201d and its linguistic incorrectness. Haack\nemphasizes that her criticisms of fuzzy logic do not apply to the base\nlogics. Moreover, it should be pointed out that mathematical fuzzy\nlogics are nowadays studied not in the first place as continuum-valued\nlogics, but as many-valued logics related to residuated lattices (see\nHajek 1998; Cignoli et al. 2000; Gottwald 2001; Galatos\net al. 2007), whereas fuzzy logic in the broad sense is to a\nlarge extent concerned with certain engineering methods.\n\nA fundamental concern about the semantical treatment of vague\npredicates is whether an adequate semantics should be\ntruth-functional, that is, whether the truth value of a complex\nformula should depend functionally on the truth values of its\nsubformulas. Whereas mathematical fuzzy logic is truth-functional,\nWilliamson (1994: 97) holds that \u201cthe nature of vagueness is not\ncaptured by any approach that generalizes truth-functionality\u201d.\nAccording to Williamson, the degree of truth of a conjunction, a\ndisjunction, or a conditional just fails to be a function of the\ndegrees of truth of vague component sentences. The sentences\n\u2018John is awake\u2019 and \u2018John is asleep\u2019, for\nexample, may have the same degree of truth. By truth-functionality the\nsentences \u2018If John is awake, then John is awake\u2019 and\n\u2018If John is awake, then John is asleep\u2019 are alike in truth\ndegree, indicating for Williamson the failure of\ndegree-functionality.\n\nOne way of in a certain sense non-truthfunctionally reasoning about\nvagueness is supervaluationism. The method of supervaluations has been\ndeveloped by Henryk Mehlberg (1958) and Bas van Fraassen (1966) and\nhas later been applied to vagueness by Kit Fine (1975), Rosanna Keefe\n(2000) and others.\n\nVan Fraassen\u2019s aim was to develop a semantics for sentences\ncontaining non-denoting singular terms. Even if one grants atomic\nsentences containing non-denoting singular terms and that some\nattributions of vague predicates are neither true nor false, it\nnevertheless seems natural not to preclude that compound sentences of\na certain shape containing non-denoting terms or vague predications\nare either true or false, e.g., sentences of the form\n\u2018If \\(A\\), then \\(A\\)\u2019. Supervaluational semantics\nprovides a solution to this problem. A three-valued assignment \\(a\\)\ninto \\(\\{T, I, F\\}\\) may assign a truth-value gap (or rather the value\n\\(I)\\) to the vague sentence \u2018Picasso\u2019s Guernica\nis beautiful\u2019. Any classical assignment \\(a'\\) that agrees with\n\\(a\\) whenever \\(a\\) assigns \\(T\\) or \\(F\\) may be seen as a\nprecisification (or superassignment) of \\(a\\). A sentence may than be\nsaid to be supertrue under assignment \\(a\\) if it is true under every\nprecisification \\(a'\\) of \\(a\\). Thus, if \\(a\\) is a three-valued\nassignment into \\(\\{T, I, F\\}\\) and \\(a'\\) is a two-valued assignment\ninto \\(\\{T, F\\}\\) such that \\(a(p) = a'(p)\\) if \\(a(p) \\in \\{T, F\\}\\),\nthen \\(a'\\) is said to be a superassignment of \\(a\\). It\nturns out that if \\(a\\) is an assignment extended to a valuation\nfunction \\(v_a\\) for the Kleene matrix \\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\), then for\nevery formula \\(A\\) in the language of \\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\), \\(v_a (A) =\nv_{a'}(A)\\) if \\(v_a (A) \\in \\{T, F\\}\\). Therefore, the function\n\\(v_{a'}\\) may be called a supervaluation of \\(v_a\\). A\nformula is then said to be supertrue under a valuation\nfunction \\(v_a\\) for \\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\) if it is true under every\nsupervaluation \\(v_{a'}\\) of \\(v_a\\), i.e., if \\(v_{a'}(A) = T\\) for\nevery supervaluation \\(v_{a'}\\) of \\(v_a\\). The property of being\nsuperfalse is defined analogously.\n\nSince every supervaluation is a classical valuation, every classical\ntautology is supertrue under every valuation function in\n\\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\). Supervaluationism is, however, not truth-functional\nwith respect to supervalues. The supervalue of a disjunction, for\nexample, does not depend on the supervalue of the disjuncts. Suppose\n\\(a(p) = I\\). Then \\(a(\\neg p) = I\\) and \\(v_{a'} (p\\vee \\neg p) = T\\)\nfor every supervaluation \\(v_{a'}\\) of \\(v_a\\). Whereas \\((p\\vee \\neg\np)\\) is thus supertrue under \\(v_a,p\\vee p\\) is not, because\nthere are superassignments \\(a'\\) of \\(a\\) with \\(a'(p) = F\\). An\nargument against the charge that supervaluationism requires a\nnon-truth-functional semantics of the connectives can be found in\nMacFarlane (2008) (cf. also other references given there).\n\nAlthough the possession of supertruth is preserved from the premises\nto the conclusion(s) of valid inferences in supervaluationism, and\nalthough it might be tempting to consider supertruth an abstract\nobject on its own, it seems that it has never been suggested to\nhypostatize supertruth in this way, comparable to Frege\u2019s\nthe True. A sentence supertrue under a three-valued valuation\n\\(v\\) just takes the Fregean value the True under every\nsupervaluation of \\(v\\). The advice not to confuse supertruth with\n\u201creal truth\u201d can be found in Belnap (2009).\n",
