    "main_text": "The Universalist Rejection of Everlasting Separation || Divine Grace and the Inclusive Nature of Love\n4.1 Divine Grace and the Inclusive Nature of Love\n\nOne argument in support of proposition (1) contends that love\n(especially in the form of willing the very best for another) is\ninclusive in this sense: even where it is logically possible for a\nloving relationship to come to an end, two persons are bound together\nin love only when their purposes and interests, even the conditions of\ntheir happiness, are so logically intertwined as to be inseparable. If\na mother should love her child even as she loves herself, for example,\nthen any evil that befalls the child is likewise an evil that befalls\nthe mother and any good that befalls the child is likewise a good that\nbefalls the mother; hence, it is simply not possible, according to\nthis argument, for God to will the best for the mother without also\nwilling the best for the child as well.\n\nFor similar reasons, Kenneth Einar Himma has argued that some\nwidespread moral intuitions, \u201ctogether with Christian\nexclusivism and the traditional doctrine of hell, entail that it is\nmorally wrong for anyone to have children\u201d (Himma 2011, 198).\nThat argument seems especially forceful in the context of Augustinian\ntheology, which implies that, for all any set of potential parents\nknow, any child they might produce could be one of the reprobate whom\nGod has hated from the beginning and has destined from the beginning\nfor eternal torment in hell. The title of Himma\u2019s article,\n\u201cBirth as a Grave Misfortune,\u201d would seem to describe such\ncases perfectly. (See Bawulski 2013 for a reply to Himma and Himma\n2016 for Himma\u2019s rejoinder.)\n\nIn any event, Arminians and universalists both regard an acceptance of\nproposition (1) as essential to a proper understanding of divine\ngrace. Could God truly extend grace to an elect mother, they might\nask, by making the baby she loves with all her heart the object of a\ndivine hatred and do this, as the Augustinians say was done in the\ncase of Esau, even before the child was born or had done anything good\nor bad? As the Arminians and the universalists both view the matter,\nthe Augustinians have embraced a logical impossibility: the idea that\nGod could extend a genuine love and compassion to one person even as\nGod withholds it from some of that person\u2019s own loved ones. They\ntherefore reject the doctrine of limited election on the ground that\nit undermines the concept of grace altogether. Where they disagree, of\ncourse, is over the issue of whether the objects of God\u2019s love\ncan resist his grace forever. Whereas Arminians hold that, given the\nreality of free will, we humans can, if we so choose, resist\nGod\u2019s grace forever, universalists tend to believe that, even\nthough we can resist God\u2019s grace for a while, perhaps even for a\nsubstantial period of time (while mired in ignorance and ambiguity),\nwe cannot resist it forever. So the issue between these two camps, the\nArminians and the universalists, finally comes down to the question of\nwhich position has the resources for a better account of human freedom\nand of God\u2019s respect for it (see, for example, the exchange\nbetween Walls 2004 and Talbott 2004). Or, to put the question in a\nslightly different way, which position, if either, requires that God\ninterfere with human freedom (or human autonomy) in morally\ninappropriate ways? As the following section should illustrate, the\nanswer to this question may be far more complicated than some might at\nfirst imagine.\n",
