    "main_text": "History of ancient skepticism\n8. History of ancient skepticism\n\nAncient skepticism has also attracted a lot of attention, though, like\nin almost all places, it has received less attention than modern\nskepticism. Roberto Bolzani Filho (Brazil) published a book (Bolzani\n2013) and a number of papers on the topic (Bolzani 1990, 1998, 2000,\n2005a). His book on Academic skepticism and Pyrrhonism is very\ncarefully written, well informed, and presents a detailed account of\nthe relationship between these two forms of ancient skepticism. Vitor\nHirschbruch Schvartz (2012) defends a rustic interpretation of\nSextus Empiricus. Recent scholarship is improving, as is shown by the\nworks of Rodrigo Pinto de Brito (Brazil) (2014) on Sextus.\n\nMore recently, studies on ancient skepticism grew thanks to the works\nof Diego Machuca (Argentina) (2006a,b, 2009, 2013a). His Ph.D.\ndissertation was on Sextus\u2019 ethics. Afterwards, he has published\nmany papers and reviews, as well as organized events. He has also\nedited a number of important collections on the history of skepticism\n(2011a,b, 2013b). It is fair to say that no one gave more impulse to\nimprove Latin American scholarship on ancient skepticism than he did.\nWith Duncan Pritchard, Machuca is the editor of the International\nJournal for the Study of Skepticism. Thus, both for his personal\npapers and books and for his involvement in organizing research,\nMachuca is a leading figure in ancient skepticism.\n\nColombia has also given its contribution to the field. In\nCuadernos de Filosof\u00eda y Letras, we find not only the\nfirst book of the Esbozos Pirr\u00f3nicos of Sextus\nEmpiricus translated by the philologist and Hellenist Jorge\nP\u00e1ramo (1989), but also many papers by scholars such as Popkin,\nGiorgio Tonelli, Porchat and Olaso, together with an examination of\nthe importance of philosophical skepticism by Carlos B.\nGuti\u00e9rrez (Colombia) (1989). In Mexico, Ornelas (Mexico) (2013,\n2014b) read Sextus\u2019 works carefully, and found theoretical\nresources that can help with the engagement with contemporary\nepistemological issues.\n\nStudies on the history of skepticism before the modern period are not\nrestricted to Pyrrhonism and Academic skepticism. It should not go\nunmentioned Maur\u00edcio Pagotto Marsola\u2019s paper (Brazil)\n(2007) on Plotinus and skepticism, for this is a very unexpected\naspect of Plotinus\u2019 philosophy. In connection to the origins of\nMedieval Philosophy, and especially Augustine and Descartes, Luis\nBacigalupo (Peru) (1999) has also done some research. Rodrigo Pinto de\nBrito (Brazil) (2015) has been working on the impact of skepticism in\nChristian thought.\n\nOne should also pay attention to Mauricio Beuchot (Mexico) (1996,\n2003) who devoted two papers to skepticism in the Middle Age. His\npoint is that skepticism attracted some attention even before\nRenaissance. According to him, many medieval authors developed\nskeptical positions. Among them, Augustine\u2019s Platonic\nChristianity appealed to Academic skepticism in its theory of\nillumination, in which Augustine emphasized the fallibility of human\nknowledge; Averroes\u2019 theory of double truth, according to which\nthere are two kinds of truth (truths for science and truths for faith)\nsimilarly has a skeptical tone, and those who thought that God could\nperhaps fool us were considering skeptical argument (Ockham, Pedro\nLombardo, Tom\u00e1s de Aquino and Buenaventura, among others).\nBeuchot also remembers that Nicol\u00e1s d\u2019Autrecourt, a\nFrench monk (1300\u20131350 approximately), active in the University\nof Paris, anticipated Humean skepticism concerning causality.\n",
