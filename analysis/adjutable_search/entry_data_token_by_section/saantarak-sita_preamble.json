    "main_text": "\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\n (725\u2013788)[1]\n was one of the most important and pivotal thinkers in the history of\nIndian and Tibetan Buddhist\n philosophy.[2]\n His contributions to Buddhist thought were particularly noteworthy\ndue to his historical position as one of the later Indian interpreters\nof the Madhyamaka thought of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (ca.\n1st\u20132nd c.). This was an historical position which allowed him\nto consider many important developments (both inside and outside the\nMadhyamaka tradition) that preceded\n him.[3]\n The central claim of the Madhyamaka School is that all phenomena are\nempty (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) of any intrinsic\nnature, unchanging essence, or absolute mode of being. This was the\ncentral idea in \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s thought as well,\nhowever, he was a commentator on both N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and\nDharmak\u012brti in equal measure. In fact,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita attempted to integrate the\nanti-essentialism of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna with the\nlogico-epistemological thought of Dign\u0101ga (ca. 6th c.)\nand Dharmak\u012brti (ca. 7th c.) along with facets of\n Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra[4]\n thought into one internally consistent, yet fundamentally Madhyamaka\nsystem. His innovative integration of facets of the three into a\nMadhyamaka framework of analysis are exemplary of the unique fruits\nwhich benefit from his historical local. The synthesis of these three\nmajor movements in Indian Buddhist philosophy was perhaps his most\nimportant contribution, among many, to the Indian Buddhist\nphilosophical tradition. This synthesis, which was also taken up by\nhis disciples (important philosophers in their own right) such as\nKamala\u015b\u012bla (740\u2013795) and to a lesser extent,\nHaribhadra (ca. 8th c.), has been characterized as the last\nmajor development in Indian Buddhist philosophy.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was a dynamic thinker and a scholar with\nboth breadth and depth of knowledge of the Indian philosophical\ntraditions. He encouraged his readers to actively engage with a host\nof non-Buddhist and Buddhist philosophical positions as they ascended\na sort of hierarchy of philosophical views, a hierarchy that\u2014in\nhis opinion\u2014culminates in the Madhyamaka view.\n\nHowever, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s contribution to Buddhist\nphilosophy as a whole did not stop in India. He made two trips to\nTibet and ultimately spent the last fifteen years of his life there.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was one of the most influential figures\nin the early dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet, founding the first\nBuddhist monastery at Samy\u00e9 (bsam yas), serving as its\nfirst abbot, ordaining the first seven Tibetan monks (Tib. sad mi\nmi bdun), and establishing a system of rigorous philosophical\nstudy based upon the traditions of learning at the great Indian\nBuddhist monastic universities such as N\u0101land\u0101 and\nVikrama\u015b\u012bla. In affect, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (and\nlater, his disciple Kamala\u015b\u012bla) taught Tibetans how to do\nphilosophy. He introduced Tibetans to a plethora of Indian\nphilosophical views, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, and taught them\nhow to study, critically analyze, and meditate upon these ideas.\nSeveral important qualities of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s\nthought that were unique to him in India, became a fully integrated\nmodus operandi of philosophy in Tibet including his dynamic\nengagement with competing philosophical views and his integration of\nMadhyamaka and logico-epistemological thought.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s works were studied among early\nTibetan monastic institutions, and his\nMadhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra (MA), along with\nKamala\u015b\u012bla\u2019s Madhyamak\u0101loka, and\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha\u2019s Satyadvayavibha\u1e45ga were\nknown as \u201cthe teachings of the Easterners\u201d (Tib. shar\nba dag) because these three authors were from Bengal. In this\nway, his influence impacted the spectrum of Tibetan philosophical\nliterature, from the earliest philosophical doxographies (Skt.\nsiddh\u0101nta, Tib. grub mtha\u2019) such as Yeshe\nDe\u2019s (ca. 8th c.) Distinguishing the Views\n(lta ba khyad par) to the commentaries and treatises of\nnumerous prestigious indigenous Tibetan philosophers such as Ngok\nLoden Sherap (rngog blo ldan shes rab) (1059\u20131109),\nChapa Ch\u00f6kyi Seng\u00e9 (phwya pa chos kyi seng ge)\n(1109\u20131169), Sakya Pandita (sa skya\npa\u1e47\u1e0dita) (1182\u20131251), Chomden Rikpai Raldri\n(bcom ldan rig pa\u2019i ral gri) (1227\u20131305),\nTsongkhapa (tsong kha pa) (1357\u20131419) and Mipham Gyatso\n(mi pham rgya mtsho) (1846\u20131912).\n",
