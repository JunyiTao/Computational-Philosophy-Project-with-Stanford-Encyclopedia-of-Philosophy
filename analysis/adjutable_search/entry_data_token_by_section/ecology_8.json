    "main_text": "New Directions || Spatial Ecology and Geographical Information Systems\n5.2 Spatial Ecology and Geographical Information Systems\n\n\nWhat has perhaps the greatest potential for altering the shape of\necology is the advent of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) which\nenables the detailed spatial representation and rapid manipulation of\ngeographical data on computers. GIS came along at a time when\necologists had already begun to explore the role of spatial structure\non the dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Within\nspatial ecology these were represented as entities having spatial\nrelations with each other, besides the traditional ecological\nrelations defined by their interactions. However, before GIS,\ntractable models required the idealization of uniform geometries (even\nin IBMs). The advent of GIS allowed the replacement of this\nidealization with more veridical spatial relations. Since philosophers\nof science have so far paid little attention to the history or\nimplications of GIS technology, the discussion here will be somewhat\nmore detailed than the treatment of other aspects of ecology.\n\n\nGIS originated in sparsely-populated Canada which, until the 1950s, at\nboth the federal and provincial governmental levels, viewed land and\nother resources as unlimited. The late but inevitable realization that\nthis was not the case led the Canadian federal government to initiate\na national inventory of land and other natural resources. The purpose\nof what was christened as the \u201cCanadian Geographical Information\nSystem\u201d in 1963-64 was to analyze data collected by the Canada\nLand Inventory (CLI) to produce statistics that could be used to\ndevelop land management plans for effective resource utilization in\nlarge areas of rural\n Canada.[95]\n The CLI produced seven maps classifying\n land.[96]\n Constructing the CGIS meant developing techniques for the rapid\nhandling and analysis of these maps and the data on which they were\nbased. Today's commercial packages GIS parasitize key conceptual and\ntechnical innovations of the CGIS. At the technical level, when the\nCGIS project was initiated, there was no prior experience on how to\nstructure geographical data internally (within the computer); there\nwere no techniques for the overlay of maps or for calculating area. An\nexperimental scanner to scan map data had yet to be built.\n\n\nAmong conceptual innovations, the most important was the distinction\nbetween: (a) the data used to draw the polygons forming the boundary\nof a place (locational information); and (b) the set of features it\nhas, that is, its attributes. Polygons need not have the same size or\ngeometry. When ecological populations and communities are modeled in a\nGIS framework, explicit asymmetric irregular spatial information can\nbe incorporated without unrealistic simplifying assumptions such as\nthat of representing the spatial structure as a square or some other\nregular geometric grid. The exploitation of this possibility takes\nspatially explicit ecological modeling beyond its traditional confines\nin which the only spatial structures that could be considered are\nthose with regular geometries. Though GIS-based ecological modeling is\nstill in its infancy (and an early example will be discussed in the\nnext paragraph), it is clear that these techniques will allow the\nconstruction of spatially-explicit ecological models at a level of\ndetail that was impossible before. Moreover IBMs can now be\nconstructed with such detailed spatial representation. The confluence\nof IBMs and GIS is arguably the most fecund area of ecological\nmodeling today.\n\n\nEqually as important as the distinction between polygon and attribute\nwas the decision to \u201cvectorize\u201d the scanned\nimages. Scanned images gave \u201craster\u201d data, that is, data\nin the form of regular grid points which either do or do not possess a\nspecific property, for instance, the presence of a given vegetation\ntype. Vectorization is the replacement of these point-based structures\nby lines that are naturally interpreted (such as boundaries of habitat\ntypes). What is critical is that these lines can then be joined to\nform polygons. Raster data can be obtained from a variety of sources\nincluding maps and photographs; in the present context what is\ncritical is that raster data can be obtained by remote sensing through\nsatellite imagery from which the distribution of many vegetation and\nsoil types can be inferred. As early as 1989 Running and several\ncollaborators estimated the annual evapotranspiration and net\nphotosynthesis for a 28 \u00b4 55 sq km region of Montana using a GIS\nsoftware\n package.[97]\n The study region was divided into 1.1 \u00b4 1.1 sq km cells defined\nby satellite sensor pixel size. The GIS package was used to integrate\ntopographic, soil, vegetation and climatic data from a variety of\nsources including the results of remote sensing. Ecological\nassumptions entered into the models that were then used to predict\nevapotranspiration and net photosynthesis. The results obtained were\nin fairly good agreement with field data.\n\n\nWithin ecology the use of GIS-based models is the analog of visual\nmodeling in other\n sciences.[98]\n It is no longer controversial that visual representation, at least as\na heuristic, offers resources for scientific innovation not offered by\npurely linear representations (such as linguistic or mathematical\nrepresentations). GIS-based models constitute two-dimensional visual\nrepresentations of ecological systems. It is likely that these\nrepresentations incorporate spatial insights that will result in new\nand fecund directions for ecological modeling to take.\n\n\nNevertheless, what is somewhat philosophically troubling about the use\nof GIS in ecology is the conceptualization and representation of\ngeographical information as: (a) a linked set of places, linked in the\nsense that the places must maintain fully precise adjacency relations;\nbut (b) an unlinked set of attributes (for instance, the presence or\nabsence of species or other biological features). There is something\ndisarmingly natural about this: it certainly seems to capture the\ngeographical rootedness in place that lies at the basis of planning\nfor biodiversity conservation. But this choice of representation has\nits costs: the mode of representation which is at the core of GIS\nmakes it \u201cnatural\u201d to represent systems in such a way that\ncertain types of relationships tend to get lost, or at least relegated\nto the background, while others receive emphasis. Consider the\nfollowing example. Carnivores cannot be present at any place unless\nprey species also exist. This trivial and obvious ecological fact\ncannot be explicitly represented using the standard resources of any\nGIS package (that is, it cannot be represented without writing special\nprograms).  Attributes are represented without relations between\nthem. This encourages, though does not require, analyses that do not\nuse relations between attributes. (Obviously, one can start with a\nGIS-based representation and add other relations as part of the\nsuperstructure of the model.) Philosophers of science have long known\nthat modes of representation influence the introduction and\ndevelopment of conceptual systems based on them. GIS may have such an\ninfluence through representational choices that guides ecology down a\npath where relations between attributes receive less emphasis than\nthey would in traditional ecological models.\n",
