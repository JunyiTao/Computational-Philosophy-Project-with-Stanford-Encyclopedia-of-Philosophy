    "main_text": "The aggregation of judgments\n5. The aggregation of judgments\n\nThe objective of a collective decision need not always be the choice\nof a winning alternative or the ranking of several alternatives in an\norder of social preference. Rather, many decision-making bodies have\nto aggregate individual sets of judgments on multiple, logically\nconnected propositions into collective sets of judgments.\n\nA court may have to judge whether a defendant is liable for breach of\ncontract on the basis of whether there was a valid contract in place\nand whether there was a breach. An expert panel may have to judge\nwhether atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations will exceed a\nparticular threshold by 2050, whether there is a causal chain from\ngreater greenhouse-gas concentrations to temperature increases, and\nwhether the temperature will increase. Legislators may have to judge\nwhether a particular end is socially desirable, whether a proposed\npolicy is the best means for achieving that end, and whether to pursue\nthat policy.\n\nIn each case, the \u2018aggreganda\u2019 are not simply preference\norderings, welfare assignments, or ratings over some set of\nalternatives, as in the models discussed in the previous sections.\nRather, the \u2018aggreganda\u2019 are entire systems of judgments\nor beliefs on some interconnected issues. The theory of judgment\naggregation represents them using formal logic. At the end of this\nsection, we also briefly consider the aggregation of probabilistic\njudgments or credences.\n",
