Works on Astrology\n\nPorta\u2019s tacit refusal to acknowledge the Aristotelian border\nbetween sub- and supralunar worlds in cosmology is a salient feature\nin his account of the hierarchy of being. This erosion of boundaries\neasily leads to the assumption that the seemingly erratic movements of\nobjects in the sublunar sphere are actually less random than they\nmight appear, because they are governed by secret, divine principles.\nConversely, the direct causal nexus between divine powers and created\nforms accounts for those objects\u2019 potential to operate in\nseemingly miraculous, but actually natural, ways (Magia 1558: bk. 1,\nch. 5). Related to these ideas are the doctrine of universal animation\nand the belief that superior celestial influx is mirrored in or\nresonates with material objects.\n\nRecently, some historians of thought have explained Porta\u2019s\nendeavor in the context of Porta\u2019s (often covert) adherence to\nthe traditions of European Astrology and related magical doctrines.\nAnd indeed Porta incorporates ideas developed in medieval Aristotelian\ntradition, especially by Albertus Magnus, which later became an issue\nfor Pietro Pomponazzi and his followers. They have emphasized that\nsuch ideas were believed to be in accordance with Aristotelianism and\nthe status of astrology as a science. (Weill-Parot 2013, Verardi\n2018). While it is certainly true that Porta cultivated a life-long\ninterest in these theories (and presumably also in their practice), at\nleast his public attitude seems to have changed significantly. This\nwas certainly in part due to the fact that astrology had been\ncondemned in ever harsher terms in the last decades of the 16th\ncentury, and to Porta\u2019s ensuing personal difficulties with\ncensorship. Probably in response to these pressures, Porta radicalized\nhis naturalism; it was indeed more profitable to write comedies and to\nshowcase marvelous inventions than to become involved in metaphysics.\nMoreover, Porta was also highly sensitive to the individual\npredilections of his addressees, who were more often than not\npotential patrons. Even with the late and unfinished Thaumaturgia\nPorta was again trying to cater to Rudolf the Second, that great\npatron of the occult arts. Perhaps for the first time in his long\nlife, this unfinished work testifies to Porta\u2019s systematic\ninterest in demonology and Neoplatonic magic (Maggi 2015, Verardi\n2018).\n\nIn the next section, we see some of the more inconvenient aspects of\nPorta\u2019s theory of magic discussed here; its circular reasoning\nand anthropomorphism reappear in Porta\u2019s ideas on\nphysiognomonics (Simon 1980; V\u00e9drine 1986).\n",
