    "main_text": "Supertasks in Relativistic Spacetime || Malament-Hogarth Spacetimes\n2.3 How Reasonable Are Malament-Hogarth Spacetimes? \n\nIn the previous section, we showed the existence of models of general\nrelativity which seem to allow for a type of bifurcated supertask.\nHere, we ask: Are these models \u201cphysically reasonable\u201d?\nEarman and Norton (1993, 1996) and Etesi and N\u00e9meti (2002) have\narticulated a number of potential physical problems concerning\nMalament-Hogarth spacetimes. First of all, we would like Bob\u2019s\nworldline to be reasonablly traversable. In the Anti-de Sitter model\nabove, the half-curve \\(\\gamma\\) has an infinite total acceleration. Bob\nwould need an infinite amount of fuel to traverse it! (Malament\n1985)\n\nAnother problem for the Anti-de Sitter spacetime is that a\n\u201cdivergent blueshift\u201d phenomenon occurs. Intuitively, the\nfrequency of any signal Bob sends to Alice is amplified more and more\nas he goes along. Eventually, even the slightest thermal noise will be\namplified to such an extent that communication is all but impossible.\nSo, if the counterexample to Goldbach\u2019s conjecture comes late in the\ngame (or not at all), it is not clear that Alice can ever know this.\n\n\nOne can find Malament-Hogarth spacetimes which can escape both of the\nproblems mentioned above (Manchak 2010; Andr\u00e9ka et al. 2018). For example, let \\(M\\) be a two-dimensional plane in\nstandard \\(t, x\\) coordinates which is then \u201crolled up\u201d along\nthe \\(t\\) axis. Let the metric \\(g\\) be such that the light cones are oriented\nin the \\(t\\) direction and do not change from point to point. (See Figure\n2.3.1.) \n\n\nFig 2.3.1.\nAn acausal Malament-Hogarth spacetime.\n\n\nBecause worldliness can wrap around and around the cylinder, \\(OP(q)=M\\)\nfor any event \\(q\\). This allows for great freedom in choosing Bob\u2019s\nworldline \\(\\gamma\\). In fact, we can choose it so that the total\nacceleration is zero \u2013 no fuel is needed to traverse it. Moreover, we\ncan choose it so that there is also no divergent blueshift phenomenon\n(see Earman and Norton 1993). But, alas, we have a new problem: the\nspacetime is acausal. A worldline can start and end at the same event\nallowing for a type of \u201ctime travel\u201d. It is unclear if\nspacetimes allowing for time travel are physically reasonable (see\nSmeenk and W\u00fcthrich 2011). It turns out that more complicated\nexamples can be constructed which avoid all the potential problems\nmentioned so far and more (Manchak 2010). But such examples contain\nspacetime \u201choles\u201d which may not be physically reasonable\n(Manchak 2009; Doboszewski 2019). More work is needed to see if such problems can\nalso be overcome. \n\nWe conclude with one final potential problem which threatens to render\nall Malament-Hogarth spacetimes physically unreasonable. Penrose\n(1979) has conjectured that all physically reasonable spacetimes are\nfree of a certain type of \u201cnaked singularities\u201d and the\nbreakdown of determinism they bring. Whether Penrose\u2019s\nconjecture is true or not is the subject of much debate (Earman\n1995). But it turns out that every Malament-Hogarth spacetime harbors\nthese naked singularities (Hogarth 1992). Even so, the breakdown of\ndeterminism guaranteed in such spacetimes does not seem to preclude\nthe construction of Malament-Hogarth \u201cmachines\u201d which\ncould possibly bring about supertasks from initial data (Earman et\nal. 2016; Manchak 2018). Stepping back, we find that it is still an\nopen question whether Malament-Hogarth spacetimes are simply artifact\nof the formalism of general relativity or if the kind of bifurcated\nsupertask they suggest can be implemented in our own universe. \n",
