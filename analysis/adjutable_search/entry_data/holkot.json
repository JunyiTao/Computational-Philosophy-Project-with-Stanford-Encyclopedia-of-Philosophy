    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Work\n\nRobert Holkot was from the village of Holcot (or \u201ccot in the\nrock\u201d as he glossed it) near Northampton, and apparently a\ncommoner: he spoke of how the most capable men seemed to come from\nhumbler backgrounds. He joined the Dominican order, and if he received\nthe usual training, obtained his initial education in arts, logic,\nAristotelian philosophy, and theology within the Dominican schools. He\nstudied at Oxford, commenting on Peter Lombard\u2019s\nSentences in the years 1331\u20131333. Once he obtained his\ndoctorate in theology, he served as Dominican regent master there.\nSubsequently, Richard of Bury, the Bishop of Durham, chose Holkot as\none of his clerks to work with him in London. Tradition also places\nHolkot at Cambridge, where he may have served as a Dominican lecturer\nor regent master in theology prior to 1343, when he is known to have\nreturned to the Dominican priory of Northampton. He remained at\nNorthampton, teaching and writing, until his death of the plague in\n1349, acquired, as the story has it, while ministering to the sick\n(Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 1\u20134).\n\nHolkot produced a number of works over his lifetime. While he was at\nOxford, he lectured on Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences, on\nMatthew and the Book of the Twelve Prophets, and engaged in ordinary\nand quodlibetal debates. He also engaged in a dispute with his fellow\nstudents about epistemology, published as the Sex articuli,\nand probably wrote another work, De imputabilitate peccati or\nOn the imputability of sin. A text, De stellis,\nOn the stars, a rough commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De\ncaelo was probably originally intended as part of his commentary\non the Sentences, but circulated as a separate tract. His\nSermo finalis, the final sermon given at the time of passing\non the lectureship on the Sentences to the next Dominican,\nalso survives (Wey 1949). While in London, Holkot helped Richard of\nBury with the book, the Philobiblon. Two works for preachers,\nthe Moralitates and the Convertimini, date from his\nlater years (Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 233\u2013249). His most famous\nBiblical lectures, on the book of Wisdom, are associated with\nCambridge, and survive as the Postilla super librum\nSapientiae (Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 162\u2013214). Portions of\nlectures on Ecclesiastes also survive, most likely from his time in\nNorthampton, and he was known to be giving lectures on Ecclesiasticus\nwhen he died. A sermon collection, spanning his career, has also been\npreserved (Slotemaker 2014; Slotemaker and Witt 2016). Most of these\ntexts exist (if they have come down to us) only in manuscript or early\nsixteenth century editions. Modern editions are available, however, of\nselected portions, sermons and questions, and of the Sex\narticuli.\n2. Relation to Ockham\n2.1 Ockham\u2019s influence\n\nAlthough Holkot was a Dominican, well versed in the texts of Aquinas,\nhis philosophy and theology owe much more to the scholastics of the\nfourteenth century than to the thirteenth. William Ockham exercised\nthe most important influence. The hallmarks of Ockham\u2019s\nphilosophy are: his reduction of Aristotle\u2019s ten categories of\nbeing to substance and quality; his analysis of the other eight\ncategories and many other terms of philosophical art as connotative\nterms, best understood as exponible into more fundamental absolute\nterms denoting substances and qualities; his rejection of\nAristotle\u2019s final, formal and material causes as properly\ncausal, keeping only efficient causality; his conception of mental\nlanguage as a logical thought structure existing independently of\nspoken language; his reformulation of the prevailing views about\nreference (supposition theory) to accommodate his spare metaphysics;\nhis rejection of species as necessary for knowledge in favor of\nintuitive cognition or the direct intellectual cognition of objects;\nand his view that the ethical precepts of the Ten Commandments are not\nabsolute but subject to divine will, such that God could, without\ncontradiction, have created a system in which moral good involves\nobeying the opposite of each of the traditional commands. Holkot\nassumed most of Ockham\u2019s philosophical positions as\nfoundational, taking them for granted in the development of his\ntheology.\n\nHolkot was not much concerned with defending or exploring his\nOckhamist philosophical presumptions. They appear as premises,\nscattered throughout his texts, rather than subjects of extended\nanalysis.\n2.2 Differences with Ockham on epistemology\n\nHolkot did differ with Ockham in the details of his epistemology.\nHolkot, like Ockham, adopted the terms \u201cintuitive\u201d and\n\u201cabstractive\u201d cognition to designate the basic forms of\nhuman understanding. But Holkot\u2019s treatment of intuitive\ncognition differed from Ockham\u2019s on the question of the\npossibility of intuitive cognition of non-existents. For Ockham,\nintuitive cognition was the direct intellectual cognition of the\npresence and existence of an object. Holkot used Ockham\u2019s own\nstyle of analysis to develop his critique. He noted that\n\u201cintuitive cognition\u201d was a connotative term, connoting\nboth a kind of quality, which is cognition, and the cognized object as\nit exists and is present in itself. The term stands for the\nco-presence of cognition with its object. This led Holkot to argue\nagainst Ockham\u2019s contention that God\u2019s omnipotent power to\ncause directly whatever is ordinarily caused through secondary causes\nwould enable God to conserve the intuitive cognition of an object even\nafter the object has been destroyed. Holkot objected that given the\nmeaning of the term \u201cintuitive cognition,\u201d if God were to\nconserve cognition of an object after destroying it, that cognition by\ndefinition could no longer be an intuitive cognition. It would be an\nabstractive cognition, the kind of cognition present in the absence of\nan object.\n\nHolkot also differed with Ockham about the nature of abstractive\ncognition. He argued in favor of retaining species as part of natural\nand cognitive processes. In De stellis he refers to the sun\npropagating the natural species of light through the medium of the\nair. He did not consider the species operative in cognition to be such\nnatural species, however. The term \u2018species\u2019 when used to\nrefer to the whiteness in one external object and to the whiteness in\nanother could be called univocal, having the same meaning in each\ncase, but the term \u2018species\u2019 used to refer to the\nwhiteness in an object as a quality and to the whiteness representing\nthe object in the intellect was equivocal. The intellectual species is\nonly a likeness of the thing in the sense of representing it (like a\nstatue of Hercules in relation to Hercules), and we experience it in\nourselves as it enables us to think about an external object in the\nabsence of that object. Holkot was not much concerned whether such\n\u201cspiritual qualities\u201d were called \u201cspecies,\u201d\n\u201cidols,\u201d \u201cimages,\u201d or \u201cexemplars\u201d\nas long as they were understood to serve as representatives of things\nor even \u201cknowledge habits\u201d and not as the natural\nqualities that exist in extramental reality. Holkot\u2019s opponent\nwas not Ockham, here, however, but his Dominican contemporary William\nCrathorn, who had argued for the view that natural and cognitive\nspecies were the same in kind. Holkot ridiculed Crathorn\u2019s\nposition at length in the Sex articuli, on the grounds that\nif Crathorn were right, our minds would become white or black, hot or\ncold, depending on what we were thinking about. Crathorn was arguing\nin line with a long tradition stretching back to Roger Bacon.\nHolkot\u2019s sharp disjunction between natural and spiritual\n\u201clikenesses,\u201d natural and spiritual qualities, went beyond\nthe traditional distinction between sensible and intelligible species\nand seems to show the effects of the Ockhamist critique, even while he\nretained remnants of the Aristotelian vocabulary.\n3. Natural Theology\n3.1 What reason cannot do\n\nOckham had argued for stringent limits on the ability of reason to\nestablish the existence of God. While an argument for the existence of\nGod as \u201cfirst conserver\u201d of things could be made, Ockham\nhad argued against the ability of natural reason to prove there was\nonly one divine being. Holkot developed such strictures, arguing that\nunaided human reason could not prove through a strict demonstration\nthat any incorporeal being like an angel or God existed. The\nconsequence for Holkot was that any reference to such incorporeal\nbeings found in the texts of ancient philosophers must have come down\nto them from their predecessors passing on a vestige of knowledge\nabout God acquired ultimately from Adam and Eve. Holkot also contended\nthat some pagans, who lacked the law of Moses, still received faith\nand grace from God outside the Mosaic Law because they did their best\nto live according to the principles of natural law. Holkot\u2019s\nsanguine view of pagan philosophers like Hermes Trismegistus and\nAristotle rested not on their ability to use natural reason to discern\ntheological truths, but on his confidence that God had accorded a\nmeasure of revelation to more than those who had the texts of\nscripture (Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 71\u201373).\n3.2 What reason can do\n\nIf basic theological premises require revelation for human beings to\nknow them, then the arena of human reason in theology is restricted to\nreasoning about what is revealed. Some of the tenets of Christian\ndoctrine, like the doctrines of the Trinity, Incarnation and\nEucharist, offer particular challenges to logic. There was a general\nbelief among medieval scholastics that Aristotelian logic exemplified\nnatural reason at its best and was universally applicable to all\ndomains because its rules held through formal relation to the\nprinciple of non-contradiction. If key Christian doctrines were not\namenable to Aristotelian logical principles, however, it would seem to\nimply that God is not subject to the principle of non-contradiction\nand that Aristotelian logic is not universal. Holkot took up these\nissues in his discussion of the doctrine of the Trinity.\n\nDifficulty arises in the doctrine of the Trinity over doctrinally true\npremises that seem to give rise to doctrinally false conclusions:\n\nThe divine Essence is the Father,\n\n\nThe divine Essence is the Son,\n\nTherefore, the Father is the Son.\n\n\nPrior to Holkot, a variety of distinctions had been proposed to modify\nthe identity relation of the copula in such premises and to block the\nconclusion. But Holkot objected that the divine Essence was in no way\n\u201creally,\u201d \u201cmodally,\u201d \u201cformally,\u201d\n\u201crationally,\u201d \u201cconvertibly,\u201d nor in any other\nway distinguished from the divine Persons or the divine relations of\npaternity, filiation and spiration. This put him back face to face\nwith the dilemma.\n\nHolkot responded in a passage for which he is perhaps best known, that\nthere must be two systems of logic, a logic appropriate to the natural\norder, exemplified in Aristotle\u2019s works, and a logic appropriate\nto the supernatural order, a logic of faith, whose rules are\nsupplementary to those of Aristotle (Slotemaker and Witt 2015,\n74\u201381, esp. 78). He concluded that Aristotelian logic did not\nhold universally, but only for the natural order unless additions were\nmade to take into account theological cases. This did not mean that he\nabandoned the principle of non-contradiction in matters of faith.\nRather the nature of the divine being meant that syllogisms involving\nTrinitarian terms functioned like expository syllogisms about\nparticulars when unquantified universal terms are substituted for\nparticular ones:\n\nHuman being is running,\n\n\nHuman being is bald.\n\nTherefore, bald human being is running.\n\n\nThe conclusion is invalid because the subject term in each premise\nmight stand for different people, like Plato and Socrates.\n\nHolkot argued that since Aristotle could not have known about God as\nthree Persons and one divine Essence, he could not have foreseen the\nneed to adjust his logic for such cases, but with some supplementary\nrules taken from religious authority, like: \u201cevery absolute is\npredicated in the singular and not in the plural about the three\npersons,\u201d and \u201cunity holds its consequent where the\nopposition of relation does not stand in the way\u201d\n(Sent. I, q. 5, f. f2ra), Holkot believed the Trinitarian\ncases could be covered. The logic of faith does not have a large\nnumber of additional principles, and it, like Aristotelian logic, is\nrational because it is subject to the principle of\nnon-contradiction.\n\nHolcot\u2019s view of the relation between faith and reason was very\nmuch in the tradition of Anselm, of faith seeking understanding. His\nadherence to the principle of non-contradiction was uncompromising:\n\u201cno intellect can assent to the opposite of the first principle\nor believe that contradictories are true at the same time\u201d\n(Quod. I, q. 2, in Exploring, 38, ll.\n165\u2013166). Faith required that reason believe that all of the\ntruths of the faith are compatible, even when at times they could not\nbe demonstrated or shown to be so.\n4. Necessity and Contingency\n4.1 Historical context\n\nThe Condemnations of 1277 and John Duns Scotus impelled the view that\nthe world could be other than it is. The idea that God\u2019s\nomnipotent power provides him with an infinity of choices out of which\nhe chooses to create only one set of possibilities became a governing\nidea among subsequent English schoolmen. Scotus also argued forcefully\nfor the idea that each moment was open to contingent possibility, such\nthat for any time t, the events at t were possible not to be the\nevents at t. Contingency, traditionally assigned to the future, in\nScotus\u2019 view superseded or governed even the hypothetical\nnecessity of the present. Ockham retreated from Scotus\u2019 view,\nreassigning contingency to future events and reasserting the full\nforce of hypothetical necessity for events in the present. However,\nworking out the implications for philosophy and theology of a\ncontingent world order was the central intellectual challenge for\nHolkot\u2019s generation.\n4.2 God\u2019s absolute and ordained power\n\nDivine omnipotence involves the absolute power to enact anything that\ndoes not involve a contradiction. But among the multitude of\npossibilities open to divine enactment, God chooses or ordains a\nsubset of compatible possibilities that constitute the world and its\nhistory as we know it. The relationship between God\u2019s absolute\npower and the ordained system in place at any given time provided a\nfault line for exploring questions of necessity and contingency.\nThirteenth century theologians formulated the relationship as one\nbetween what God has done and what he could have done otherwise,\nsafely relegating contingency to a now foreclosed past. Canon lawyers,\nhowever, appropriated the distinction to describe the powers of the\npope to set aside \u201cordained\u201d or enacted Church law through\nthe \u201cplenitude\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d power of his\noffice. Because papal power transcended enacted law, and popes (and\nmonarchs) who enacted laws were in some sense not subject to those\nlaws, they could provide for exceptions or change enacted laws without\ncontradiction. Such application of the distinction between absolute\nand ordained power raised the possibility that God might intervene in\nthe ordained system through his absolute power. Beginning with Scotus,\nthe formulation of the canonists began to enter into discussions of\nGod\u2019s exercise of absolute power. The appropriation of the legal\ntradition did not lead to the conclusion (at least for Scotus, Ockham\nand Holkot) that God uses his absolute power to act inordinately in\nthe ordained system, but rather it enables God (as it did in the\nchange from the Old to the New Law) to set aside one ordained system\nand replace it with another. Several different and incompatible\nsystems of divine legislation have operated at different times during\nhuman history. God\u2019s absolute capacity to transcend any given\nordained system and replace it with another has made such a switch\npossible without involving God in a contradiction of his nature.\nHolkot also invoked this dialectical relationship between God\u2019s\nabsolute and ordained power to explain how God provides for\ndispensations from his laws in particular cases. God never acts\ninordinately, but the system of divine ordinations is complex and\ninvolves multiple incompatible subsets capable of being in place at\nany given time (Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 32\u201337).\n\nHolkot analyzed God\u2019s power in terms of sets of compatible\npropositions.\n\nIf all the propositions that can exist, were to exist, God cannot do\nwhat would entail contradictory propositions being true at the same\ntime, and He can do all those things that, having posed them perfectly\ninstantiated in being, entail no contradictory propositions being true\nat the same time. (Sent. II, q. 2, art. 6, f. i4va)\n\n\nHe then argued that talk of God\u2019s absolute and ordained power\nwas not about a two-fold power, but two ways of modifying the\nproposition: \u201cGod can produce A.\u201d The proposition\n\u201cGod can produce A from his ordained power,\u201d means that it\nis possible for God to produce A, and A will be compatible with his\nexisting statutes. The proposition \u201cGod can produce A from his\nabsolute power,\u201d means that it is possible for God to produce A\n(because A in itself entails no contradictory propositions being\nsimultaneously true), and A is not compatible with his existing\nstatutes. God has only one power, which is God himself, and which\nhuman beings can understand in two different ways: ordinately and\nabsolutely. (The stricture on propositional existence results from his\nview, which he shared with Ockham and a number of his contemporaries,\nthat only propositional tokens counted as real propositions capable of\nproducing a logical contradiction.)\n\nThe principle of non-contradiction served as the ultimate safeguard of\nrationality and certainty in Holkot\u2019s system. The role of the\nprinciple was particularly important because Holkot, more than perhaps\nany other late medieval theologian, underscored God\u2019s freedom to\nset aside ordained laws without incurring any fault or obstacle.\n\nGod can be obliged to no law but that without its observance he can be\nmorally good, because otherwise the divine goodness would depend on\ncreatures, and God would be less good than he is if he were to destroy\nevery creature; and similarly God would begin to be better than he was\nbefore the observance of the law. Whence, just as a prince who is\nabove the law can perform some act without sin or evil, which those\nexisting under the law in no way can do without sin, so God in not\nfulfilling what he promised acts without the evil of falsity or\nperjury, which someone existing under the law could in no way do\n(Quodl. III, q. 8, in Seeing the Future, 103, ll.\n537\u2013546).\n\n\nDivine promises, revelations, and enactments were all in\nHolkot\u2019s view ungrounded in divine goodness in the sense that\nGod was not under obligation because of his goodness to fulfill them\nor keep them in being. The contingency of the ordained system was a\nfact of the human condition. So what reassurance could human beings\nhave that keeping faith with God\u2019s precepts would result in\ntheir salvation? What would happen if God were to set aside the\ncurrent law and enact some incompatible alternative, as it would\nclearly seem to be in God\u2019s power to do? If God did not inform\npeople about such a change, then invincible ignorance would protect\nthem from being held accountable for not following the new laws.\nHolkot did not believe that God could ask people to obey laws of which\nthey were ignorant because that would require them to do what is\nimpossible and contradictory. And if God did inform people of the new\nlaws, then these laws would supersede the incompatible old set, and\nthe faithful could obey God without being held to contradictory\ncommands.\n5. Divine Command Ethics\n5.1 Covenantal Theology\n\nIn a system of divine command ethics, human beings are obliged to do\nwhat God asks them to do because God commands it, not because there is\nsome underlying system of absolute goodness that ethical precepts\nshould ideally mirror. William Ockham had subscribed to such a view.\nHe had argued that no contradiction would arise if God were to command\nthat the Ten Commandments, the precepts fundamental to both the Old\nand New Laws, were no longer in effect and that from then on people\nwould be obliged to obey their opposites. Most of Ockham\u2019s\nsympathizers backed away from the idea that God could command people\nto hate him, on the grounds that that command, at least, would be\ncontradictory. But Holkot followed Ockham in subscribing to the\nultimate contingency of the decalogue.\n\nWith no act having intrinsic worth, the meritoriousness of human\nbehavior was grounded in a covenant between God and the human\nfaithful. Within the terms of the New Law, God would not deny\nsalvation to all those who did their best to obey his commands and\nadhere to the Articles of the Faith. The causal effect of meritorious\nacts in effecting salvation was a secondary form of causality,\nfunctioning like money, as an agreed upon medium of exchange in the\neconomy of salvation. Because God\u2019s goodness was not a guarantee\nof covenant, however, Holkot stressed that human adherence to the\nterms of the covenant constituted an act of faith that God would\nindeed uphold his promises, even knowing that nothing compels God to\ndo so (Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 30\u201332).\n5.2 The significance of intention\n\nWhere the fact of command matters more than the substance of what is\ncommanded, human intention to obey has greater significance than the\nsubstantive enactments of obedience. Holkot perceived the connection\nbetween divine command and the human intention to obey as at the heart\nof the relationship between human beings and God. For instance, Holkot\nposed the case of a simple old woman, who in good faith comes to\nchurch to hear a new church doctrine from her bishop. If the bishop\ngets the doctrine backwards, explaining to his congregation that they\nshould believe just the opposite of what the new article of belief\ncontains, is the elderly laywoman required to accept the words of her\nbishop as true? One of Holkot\u2019s fellow scholars had argued that\nshe would only be in this position if she were being punished for sin,\nbut Holkot responded that it was not the substance of her belief that\nmattered, but her intention to do what was right and to obey God. Her\nintention to do her best to conform her will to God would be\nsufficient under the covenant to ensure her salvation if she were to\npersevere in that intention. God would not deny her salvation because\nthose on whom she necessarily depended for knowledge about God\u2019s\nwill were misinformed or confused (Slotemaker and Witt 2015,\n60\u201362).\n\nDebates over the place of deception in terms of both the absolute and\nordained systems of possibility involved Holkot and a number of his\nimmediate contemporaries. If the world is a contingent place that can\nbe other than it is, then do God\u2019s revelations constrain the\nscope of his possible future actions? If not, can what God says be\ndeceptive or false? Discussion took up scriptural instances in which\nGod seemed to deceive. Holkot, against a number of his contemporaries,\nargued that God can deceive human beings even in the ordained system,\nhas deceived them as shown in scripture, and has deceived them for no\nredeeming good apparent to human beings. If God\u2019s words to human\nbeings might be deceptive, such that it is not just the bishop who may\nimpart false information, but even God, then the human intention to\nbelieve God\u2019s words as true and to obey them takes on even more\nimportance. Holkot did not believe that God was playing the role of\nDescartes\u2019 deceiving demon, but Holkot also did not know how to\nrule out the possibility that he might be deceived about any given\nthing he believed (Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 94\u201399). The\nimportant thing was that even if he were deceived, God had promised\nthat his intention to believe what was revealed and to do what he\nunderstood God wanted him to do provided security under the covenant.\nFaith in the covenant was the source of certainty, not rational\ndemonstration.\n\nThe place of intentionality in Holkot\u2019s theology and his\ngenerous view of divine graciousness provide the context for his use\nof a version of what has come to be called \u201cPascal\u2019s\nwager.\u201d Holkot passed on a story about a learned heretic who was\nconverted to a belief in immortality by a challenge from a Dominican\nlay brother: if you believe in immortality and it is true, you will\nhave gained a great deal, and if you believe in immortality and it is\nnot true, you will lose nothing. Forming an intention to believe could\nconstitute doing his best on the part of the heretic, and God would\nreward such an intention with the grace necessary for conversion to\nthe belief.\n6. Divine Foreknowledge\n\nDiscussions about the contingency of the created order and the various\nways necessity might impinge on that contingency tended to focus on\nthe challenge God\u2019s foreknowledge of future events posed to the\ncontingency of events.\n\nIn his commentary on Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences, Holkot\nput forward an elaborate argument:\n\nIf a is a sin that Socrates will freely commit tomorrow.\n\n\nThen it is argued: God knows that a will be, therefore from\neternity He knew that a will be or he began to know that\na will be.\n\nIt cannot be said that He began to know that a will be,\nbecause then He could know or foreknow something anew and as a result\nof time. . . .\n\nIf He knew a from eternity, I pose that \u201ca\nwill be\u201d was written on a wall yesterday. Therefore, the\nproposition \u201cthat written on the wall was true\u201d is true,\nand . . . consequently necessary because it is a true proposition\nabout the past. Therefore, it is necessary that it be the case as the\nproposition denotes, i. e., it is necessary that Socrates sin.\n(Sent. II, q. 2, in Seeing the Future, 126,\nll. 307\u2013317)\n\n\nHolkot contended that the common response of his era to such an\nargument, was to pose the possibility of a counterfactual past: to say\nthat the proposition \u201ca will be\u201d is true, yet\ncontingently true, and therefore, although it is true, it can never\nhave been true. Holkot argued, the possibility of a counterfactual\npast differentiated propositions about the future on contingent\nmatters and their equivalents--whether set in the past or\npresent--from propositions about the past and present that are not\nabout such contingent matters. The propositions \u201ca was\nknown by God,\u201d and \u201ca is known by God,\u201d\nalthough set in the past and present, are true and yet can never have\nbeen true, just like other propositions about the future, because they\nare about a, and a, as a future contingent, may\nstill not happen. Holkot\u2019s response is recognizable as a version\nof what in modern discussions is called the Ockhamist solution,\nalthough the argument traces back at least to Bonaventure (Slotemaker\nand Witt 2015, 87\u201394).\n6.1 The \u201cobligational\u201d model\n\nWhat Holkot added to the discussion was an elaborate analysis of such\npuzzles using the rules and structure of obligational debates to\nexplore counterfactual possibility. Debates de obligatione\nwere a commonplace in the medieval university curriculum and involved\none person, the \u201copponent\u201d posing a proposition to\nanother, the \u201crespondent,\u201d that, if accepted, would form\nthe basis for a continuing exchange. The posed proposition was usually\na counterfactual or a proposition whose truth status was uncertain.\nThe opponent then proposed further propositions to the respondent,\neach of which might follow from, contradict or be irrelevant to the\nfirst. The respondent was to take the first proposition as true for\nthe time of the debate (understood in Holkot\u2019s version to take\nplace in a single hypothetical instant of time), and to respond with\nagreement or rejection depending on whether the succeeding\npropositions followed from what had been agreed on before or\ncontradicted the preceding concessions. If a proposed proposition was\nunconnected with any of the preceding propositions, the respondent\nwould respond with agreement, rejection or doubt depending on what he\nunderstood the actual state of affairs in the world to be. The forms\nand rules of obligational debate suggested a rigorous format for\nexploring the contingent possibilities, which Holkot adopted (Gelber\n2004, 171\u2013189; Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 26\u201330).\n\nA simple form of the puzzle might proceed as follows:\n\nOpponent: Let it be the case that God knows a will be, where\na is a future contingent.\n\n\nRespondent: I accept.\n\nOpponent: Everything that is possible to be is also possible not to be\n(by the definition of contingency).\n\nRespondent: I accept.\n\nOpponent: As a future contingent, a is possible to be and\npossible not to be.\n\nRespondent: I accept.\n\nOpponent (from the Aristotelian rule that the impossible does not\nfollow from the possible): Let it be the case that a will not\nbe.\n\nRespondent: I accept.\n\nOpponent: Then God is deceived.\n\n\nIn resolving such puzzles, Holkot invoked a series of rules, one of\nwhich has significance for his moral philosophy, as well. Holkot\nargued that when the opponent proposed the initial proposition, he was\nalso implicitly posing the rejection of its contradictory. The\nAristotelian rule that the impossible does not follow from the\npossible, seems to allow the contradictory of the initial proposition\nto enter the debate. But Holkot argued that such a move in effect\namounted to starting the debate all over again with a new starting\npoint, a proposition contradictory to the first. The respondent would\nnow be obliged, if he continued with the debate, to answer in\naccordance with the new contradictory proposition, and would refuse to\nconcede that \u201cGod is deceived.\u201d\n\nHolkot viewed the human relationship to divine revelation as\nequivalent to engaging in an obligational debate. The faithful\nobligated themselves to accept divine revelations as true for the time\nof this life (even though as contingents it was possible that they\nmight not be true), and if God commanded them to act in a way contrary\nto previous commands, the new commandment would supersede the old,\njust as if a new obligational debate had begun. Those who accepted the\nobligation to obey, would also be obligated to live in a way that was\nconsistent with the obligations incurred, even if God did not reveal\nthe details. Human reason was required to discern how to act in\nuncertain cases.\n6.2 The modal ground of experience\n\nIn dealing with the problem of God\u2019s knowledge of future\ncontingents, Ockham had proposed thinking about time as the modal\nfeature of language. Propositions in the past tense are necessary\nper accidens: they refer to events that could have been\notherwise before they happened, but that now could not have been other\nthan they were because of the necessity of the past. Propositions in\nthe present tense are hypothetically necessary: they refer to events\nthat could be otherwise, but given that they are what they are, if\nthey are, cannot not be what they are. Propositions in the future\ntense are contingent: they refer to events that are possible to be and\nalso possible not to be. Ockham argued that God\u2019s knowledge of\nevents tracked this modal arrow just as human knowledge of events\ndoes, reintroducing an arrow of \u201ctime\u201d for God as well as\nhuman beings.\n\nIn the ensuing years, Ockham\u2019s modal view of \u201ctime\u201d\nwas joined to a way of speaking about truth traceable to Richard of\nCampsall, an Oxford master of arts and theology teaching in the years\njust before Ockham. Holkot exemplifies this way of thinking.\n\nIn De Interpretatione, chapter 9, Aristotle had bequeathed a\ndifficult problem to the medieval debate about divine foreknowledge.\nHis contention that in order to avoid attaching necessity to all\nevents, propositions about future events were not yet true or false\nseemed either to deny to God the possibility of knowing the future or\nto rule out the contingency of events. Boethius had provided a\nresponse that held until the fourteenth century, but after Scotus\nsubjected his response to a severe critique, new discussion of the\nAristotelian three-valued logic appeared. Campsall distinguished\nbetween propositions about the past and present that were\n\u201cdeterminately true or false\u201d and propositions about the\nfuture that were \u201cindeterminately true or false.\u201d Holkot\nadopted this way of modally dividing up determinations of truth and\nfalsity:\n\n. . . future contingents are said to be propositions about the future\nof which there is no determinate truth or falsity, because although\nthey are true or false, yet those which are true can never have been\ntrue and those which are false can never have been false.\n(Quod. III, q. 1, in Seeing the Future, 63, ll.\n93\u201396)\n\n\nBy the time of Holcot, the analysis of future contingency in terms of\na possible counterfactual past, and the identification of such an\nanalysis with a multi-valued logic, had attained the status of an\nidentifiable tradition. Ockham had not adopted the terminology of\n\u201cindeterminately true or false\u201d and \u201ccontingently\ntrue or false\u201d to speak of the truth status of future contingent\npropositions. He had insisted on a two-valued system in which all\npropositions are determinately true or false. But Holkot departed from\nhim in this. Holkot\u2019s position reflects a view of modality as\nprimary. Necessity and contingency are fundamental, and judgments of\ntruth mean something different in each modal context, rather than\ntruth being primary, and necessity and contingency providing a\ndifferent valence to otherwise true propositions. The efforts to\ngrapple with the implications of contingency had come a long way\n(Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 87\u201394).\n",
