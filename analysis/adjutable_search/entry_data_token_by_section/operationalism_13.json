    "main_text": "Current relevance of operationalism || Operationalism as a strategy for increasing empirical content\n3.4 Operational analysis as the revealer of complexity\n\nIn closing, I would like to pull out an insight from Bridgman that is\nusually not recognized in discussions of operationalism, but actually\nhas emerged as a significant point of contention in more recent\nphilosophy of science. This is the issue of complexity. In\nSection 1.1 I have already quoted Bridgman\u2019s puzzling statement\nthat nature is ultimately \u201cneither understandable nor subject to\nlaw.\u201d As it turns out, that was not an isolated off-hand remark.\nAn important aspect of Bridgman\u2019s operationalism was a search\nfor certainty, and it was a search made all the more desperate by a\ndeep-rooted pessimism about the possibility of attaining any certainty\nin science, at least if scientists were to seek a simple and unified\nsystem of knowledge. Bridgman professed his belief that \u201cthe\nexternal world of objects and happenings is \u2026 so complex that\nall aspects of it can never be reproduced by any verbal\nstructure.\u201d He lamented: \u201cEven in physics this is not\nsufficiently appreciated, as is shown, for example, by the reification\nof energy. The totality of situations covered by various aspects of\nthe energy concept is too complex to be reproduced by any simple\nverbal device.\u201d (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 78)\n\nBridgman\u2019s view on the complexity of nature also had a direct\nimplication for the limits of operational analysis itself in providing\nclarity and precision. Right from The Logic of Modern\nPhysics, Bridgman stressed that \u201call results of measurement\nare only approximate\u201d; this obvious fact, he said,\n\u201ctacitly underlies all our discussion\u201d. This he attributed\nultimately to something fundamental about the nature of human\nexperience: \u201call experience seems to be of this character; we\nnever have perfectly clean-cut knowledge of anything, but all our\nexperience is surrounded by a twilight zone, a penumbra of\nuncertainty, into which we have not yet penetrated. This penumbra is\nas truly an unexplored region as any other region beyond\nexperiment\u201d (1927, 33). This indicated a fundamental limitation\nto the certainty of operations: \u201cOperations themselves are, of\ncourse, derived from experience, and would be expected also to have a\nnebulous edge of uncertainty\u201d (1927, 36). Bridgman remained\nclearly aware of the complexities revealed by operational analysis,\nstating late in his life that \u201coperational analysis can always\nbe pushed to the point where sharpness disappears\u201d (Bridgman in\nFrank 1956, 78), and that \u201cthere is nothing absolute or final\nabout an operational analysis\u201d (Bridgman 1959b, 522). Still, he\nwould not give up on the pushing, which was necessary to reach as much\nclarity as possible.\n\nBridgman\u2019s battle against his own skeptical and pessimistic\nconscience was a heroic one. After decades of operationalist thinking\nhe arrived at \u201ca picture of man isolated \u2026 in an oasis of\nphenomena which he will never be able to transcend because beyond its\nbounds the operations are impossible which are necessary to give\nmeaning to his thought\u201d (Bridgman 1955, 540). What this picture\nforced on him was a deep sense of humility, as expressed in his\nmemorable statement on the scientific method: \u201cThe scientific\nmethod, as far as it is a method, is nothing more than doing\none\u2019s damnedest with one\u2019s mind, no holds barred\u201d\n(1955, 535). Retaining that sense of humility will help us in\ndeveloping Bridgman\u2019s unfinished thoughts to create a new\noperationalism that does full justice to the complexity and richness\nof both nature and human scientific practice.\n",
