    "main_text": "Ross\u2019s Moral Metaphysics\n6. Ross\u2019s Moral Metaphysics\n\nLike many in his time, Ross took pains to undermine various\ndefinitions of moral terms. He draws a distinction between\nnaturalistic and non-naturalistic definitions. The former are\n\u2018definitions which claim to define an ethical term without using\nany other ethical term\u2019 (FE 6). The latter are definitions which\nattempt \u2018to define one ethical term by the aid of another\u2019\n(FE 6; cf. 42).\n\nRoss rejects all naturalistic definitions of moral terms, including\n\u2018right\u2019 and (intrinsic) \u2018good\u2019. In RG, he\nargues (following Moore 1912 and Sidgwick 1907) that the moral terms\n\u2018right\u2019 and \u2018ought\u2019 are incapable of\ndefinition: \u2018right\u2019 is an \u2018irreducible notion\u2019\n(RG 12). In FE, he suggests again \u2018right\u2019 is indefinable\n(FE 42), though he is sympathetic to the idea that \u2018right\u2019\nis definable in terms of \u2018suitable\u2019 (FE 52\u201355). On\nthis view, \u2018this act is right\u2019 means \u2018this act has\n\u201cthe greatest amount of suitability possible in the\ncircumstances\u201d\u2019 (FE 53; also 55). This is not a naturalist\ndefinition, since \u2018suitability\u2019 is itself a \u2018unique\nand indefinable\u2019 ethical notion (FE 146; also 159).\n\nIn RG, Ross appears to reject all naturalistic attempts to define\n\u2018good\u2019 (RG 78ff.). He is in particular keen to impugn\nviews providing relational accounts of \u2018good\u2019; that is,\nviews defining it in terms of some relation to a mental state, e.g.,\ndesire. His view appears to be that \u2018goodness is a quality which\ncan no more be defined in terms of anything other than itself, than\ncan the quality of the sensation which we describe as being one of\n\u201cseeing yellow\u201d\u2019 (RG 86). In FE, he seems to affirm\nthe view that \u2018good\u2019 is indefinable (FE 262), though again\nhe seems sympathetic to a non-naturalistic definition, according to\nwhich \u2018good\u2019 is definable in terms of\n\u2018admirable\u2019 or \u2018commendable\u2019 (FE 271, 283). He\nsays this sense of \u2018good\u2019 applies only to things that are\nintrinsically good in the sense of being objects worthy of admiration,\nand (as noted above) only virtue and intellectual activity are worthy\nof admiration (FE 283). The notion of \u2018good\u2019 as applied to\nthe goods of pleasure and justice can be defined relationally. These\ngoods are not objects worthy of admiration but rather fit objects of\nsatisfaction. Both notions of good are in a sense definable, but the\ndefinitions are non-natural: in both cases \u2018good\u2019 is\ndefined in terms of \u2018worthiness\u2019 or\n\u2018rightness\u2019 (FE 279, 282).\n\nRoss suggests a number of arguments against various (naturalistic and\nnon-naturalistic) definitions of moral terms. He relies in part on the\nfollowing kind of argument, which is directed at Moore (RG 8). If\n\u2018right\u2019 and \u2018being productive of the greatest good\nin the circumstances\u2019 mean the same thing, it is not the case it\nis intelligible the proposition \u2018the \u201cright act\u201d\njust is \u201cthe act productive of the greatest good in the\ncircumstances\u201d\u2019 should have been denied and maintained\n\u2018with so much fervour; for we do not fight for or against\nanalytic propositions\u2019 (RG 8). It is intelligible that these\npropositions should have been denied and maintained with so much\nfervour. Therefore, it is not the case that \u2018right\u2019 and\n\u2018productive of the greatest good in the circumstances\u2019\nmean the same thing. This argument can be generalised to reject the\nusual suspects, e.g., \u2018right\u2019 means \u2018approved of by\nme\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 means \u2018approved of by the\nmajority of society\u2019, and so on. But it is not the best\nargument, since we may well fight over analytic propositions,\nespecially when they are opaque or unobvious.\n\nRoss seems to acknowledge this sort of worry. He writes \u2018the\nfact that we accept some definition as correct shows that the term did\nsomehow stand for a complex of elements; yet the fact that we are for\nsome time in doubt about whether the term is analysable, and if so,\nwhat the correct analysis is, shows that this complex of elements was\nnot distinctly present to our mind before, or during, the search for a\ndefinition\u2019 (RG 92\u201393). In reply, he says the only way to\nrebut the claim \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019 are\ndefinable (naturalistically) is to examine \u2018all the definitions\nthat possess any initial plausibility\u2019 (RG 93). To these we\nshould apply two tests (FE 259; RG 93). First, we should determine\nwhether \u2018the definition applies to all things to which the term\napplies, and to no others\u2019 (FE 259; also RG 93). Second, we\nshould ask whether the proposed definition expresses \u2018explicitly\nwhat we had implicitly in mind when we used the term\u2019 (FE 259;\nalso RG 93). Using these tools, Ross rejects (among others) the\nposition that \u2018this act is right\u2019 means \u2018all or most\nmen\u2026react to the act with a feeling of approval\u2019 (FE 24).\nWe often judge an act is right even when we know we are alone in\nholding this view (FE 25).\n\nThese are not the only arguments on which Ross relies. Against the\nview \u2018right\u2019 means \u2018awakes in me the emotion of\napproval\u2019 (FE 22), he argues it is unable to explain \u2018the\npossibility of difference of opinion on the rightness of acts\u2019\n(FE 24). On this view, if I say \u2018incest is impermissible\u2019\nand you say \u2018incest is permissible\u2019 we are not\ndisagreeing, since all I am saying is \u2018incest awakes in me the\nemotion of disapproval\u2019 and all you are saying is \u2018incest\nawakes in me the emotion of approval\u2019, two statements that\nappear to be \u2018perfectly compatible\u2019 with each other (FE\n24). But we want to say the two statements are not compatible. Ross\ngives the same argument against the claim \u2018X is\ngood\u2019 means \u2018I have a certain feeling toward\nX\u2019. If I say \u2018X is good\u2019 and you\nsay \u2018X is bad\u2019, you are saying you have a certain\n(negative) feeling toward X and I am saying I have a certain\n(positive) feeling toward X, two statements that seem to be\ncompatible with each other. Yet, he urges, \u2018if anything is\nclear, it is that we do suppose ourselves to be making incompatible\nstatements about the object\u2019 (RG 83).\n\nRoss also appears to reject various analyses of moral terms in order\nto preserve a certain way of conducting moral philosophy (Shaver 2007,\n286, 295). He notes \u2018there is a system of moral truth, as\nobjective as all truth must be, which, and whose implications, we are\ninterested in discovering\u2019 (RG 15; also 20, 29; KT 60). The\ndiscovery of these truths is not a matter of scientific\n(empirical) investigation. Ethical truths are not discovered by\n\u2018mere observation\u2019 (FE 7; also 168).\n\nInstead, they are \u2018grasped by an intuitive act of human\nreason\u2019 (FE 3). \u2018The use of the senses, and the physical\nsciences, give us no propositions in which \u2018right\u2019 or\n\u2018obligatory\u2019 occurs as a term\u2019 (KT 87). There are\n\u2018two types of predicate\u2014those that can be discovered by\nexperience to belong to their subjects, and those that can be\ndiscovered by insight, and let us grant that rightness belongs to the\nsecond class\u2019 (KT 81). In science,\n\u2018sense-experience\u2026furnishes\u2026real data\u2019 (RG\n40). In ethics, \u2018no such appeal is possible. We have no more\ndirect way of access to the facts about rightness and goodness and\nabout what things are right or good, than by thinking about\nthem\u2019 (RG 40; emphasis added; also 82).\n\nTo entrench this idea he draws analogies between mathematic and\nlogical knowledge and ethical knowledge (RG 29, 30, 32; KT 42, 85; FE\n320). He is fan of synthetic a priori truths in ethics (and\nelsewhere) (FE 35\u201336; also 320). Since it might be possible to\narrive at ethical knowledge by means of (mere) experience if moral\nterms were reducible to natural terms, this provides Ross with an\nincentive to show no such reduction is possible. He wants in short to\nprotect a moral methodology prizing appeal to what \u2018we\u2019\nthink, the thoughts of the \u2018best and most enlightened\u2019 (FE\n172), consensus amongst experts (OJ 119\u2013120; FE 191) and various\nkinds of thought experiments. Indeed, it has been suggested that\nthrough the use of these tools it is possible to demonstrate that\nthough \u2018right\u2019 is not synonymous with a natural property\nit nonetheless refers to some natural property, e.g., what has the\ngreatest balance of justice, beneficence, fidelity, and so on, over\ninjustice, non-maleficence and infidelity, and so on (Shaver 2007,\n289). (This may be controversial if such notions as\n\u2018justice\u2019 are incapable of complete naturalization. If\ncomplete naturalization is not an option, then Ross may be forced to\nendorse a less palatable metaphysics.)\n\nRoss holds the basic claims of morality express \u2018facts which are\nself-evidently necessary\u2019 (FE 320; also 262). Are these\nobjective facts of a special kind? The standard suggestion is for Ross\nmoral facts are non-natural facts or non-natural properties\n(Stratton-Lake 2002a, xxi; Frankena 1963, 86\u201387; 1973, 103). It\nis not clear he actually holds this view. He says very little about\nthe nature of moral facts except (perhaps unhelpfully) to compare them\nto mathematical and logical facts. He does not appear to infer from\nthe failure of naturalistic definitions of moral terms that the terms\nrefer to distinct properties. His focus is almost entirely on\ndefinitions of \u2018right\u2019 and (intrinsic) \u2018good\u2019.\nHis concern is with what \u2018we have in mind\u2019 not with\nproperties (FE 13, 42), though, problematically, he often refers to\n\u2018good\u2019 as a \u2018quality\u2019 or\n\u2018characteristic\u2019 or \u2018property\u2019 (RG 82, 87, 88,\n110, 122; FE 278, 279). He writes that \u2018the difference between\ngoodness or value and such attributes as yellowness is there whereas\nthe latter are differentiae\u2026of their possessors, the\nformer is a property (i.e. a consequential attribute) of\nthem\u2019 (RG 121; italics in original).\n\nIt is not clear Ross intends this view to be an inference from his\narguments against naturalistic or other analyses. That he offers no\nexplicit argument to this effect suggests he likely did not intend the\ninference (cf. Stratton-Lake 2002a), and he nowhere rules out that\nmoral properties are natural properties. At any rate, he does not need\nto make this inference to achieve the aims he has in rebutting the\nvarious definitions he discusses. The arguments he uses are sufficient\nto preserve (in his view) plausible moral semantics, moral\ndisagreement, and his moral methodology. This should please the\nadherents of this view, though it still leaves Ross with the task of\nmaking sense of the nature of moral truth if it is not to be\nunderstood as correspondence to the moral facts.\n\nRoss\u2019s appeal to self-evidence and his defence of the synthetic\na priori may seem problematic to many, though recent defences\nof these views suggest their fortunes are improving (Audi 1996, 2004;\nCrisp 2002; Parfit 2011; Stratton-Lake 2002a, 2002b). To defend\nhimself, Ross might simply eschew appeal to self-evidence and\ncertainty with respect to intuitions about general principles and\nreplace them with appeal to moral beliefs of high reliability or to\nconsidered convictions about moral claims (Griffin 1996; Hooker 2000;\nRawls 1971). This seems to give him what he needs methodologically\n(for discussion, see Irwin 2009, 686\u201390). The appeal to considered\nconvictions allows him the ability to say, for example, we know\ndirectly pain is bad and it is prima facie wrong to break\nyour promises; in addition, he can avoid the defects of coherence\ntheories of justification by holding there are at least some\npropositions not justified exclusively by coherence (FE 141; Ross\n1931, 61\u201362).\n\nThis (importantly) puts him on the same level as almost all moral\ntheorists working today. It is less clear Ross is able to divest\nhimself of synthetic a priori truths. But if his endorsement\nof synthetic a priori truths is one way of securing the\nstandard way of doing moral philosophy, which involves appeal to\nthought-experiments, intuition, what we think, and so on, it is more\ndifficult to reject. It is more difficult to reject still if we accept\nsuch claims in areas outside ethics and if we are not keen on (radical\nforms of) empiricism.\n",
