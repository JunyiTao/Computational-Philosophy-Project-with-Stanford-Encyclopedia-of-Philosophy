    "main_text": "Environmental Ethics and Politics || Deep Ecology\n3.1 Deep Ecology\n\n\u201cDeep ecology\u201d was born in Scandinavia, the result of\ndiscussions between N\u00e6ss and his colleagues Sigmund\nKval\u00f8y and Nils Faarlund (see N\u00e6ss 1973 and 1989; also\nsee Witoszek and Brennan (eds.) 1999 for a historical survey and\ncommentary on the development of deep ecology). All three shared a\npassion for the great mountains. On a visit to the Himalayas, they\nbecame impressed with aspects of \u201cSherpa culture\u201d\nparticularly when they found that their Sherpa guides regarded certain\nmountains as sacred and accordingly would not venture onto them.\nSubsequently, N\u00e6ss formulated a position which extended the\nreverence the three Norwegians and the Sherpas felt for mountains to\nother natural things in general.\n\nThe \u201cshallow ecology movement\u201d, as N\u00e6ss (1973) calls\nit, is the \u201cfight against pollution and resource\ndepletion\u201d, the central objective of which is \u201cthe health\nand affluence of people in the developed countries.\u201d The\n\u201cdeep ecology movement\u201d, in contrast, endorses\n\u201cbiospheric egalitarianism\u201d, the view that all living\nthings are alike in having value in their own right, independent of\ntheir usefulness to others. The deep ecologist respects this intrinsic\nvalue, taking care, for example, when walking on the mountainside not\nto cause unnecessary damage to the plants.\n\nInspired by Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics, another key feature of\nN\u00e6ss\u2019s deep ecology is the rejection of atomistic\nindividualism. The idea that a human being is such an individual\npossessing a separate essence, N\u00e6ss argues, radically separates\nthe human self from the rest of the world. To make such a separation\nnot only leads to selfishness towards other people, but also induces\nhuman selfishness towards nature. As a counter to egoism at both the\nindividual and species level, N\u00e6ss proposes an alternative\nrelational \u201ctotal-field image\u201d of the world.\nAccording to this relationalism, organisms (human or otherwise) are\nbest understood as \u201cknots\u201d in the biospherical net. The\nidentity of a living thing is essentially constituted by its relations\nto other things in the world, especially its ecological relations to\nother living things. If people conceptualise themselves and the world\nin relational terms, the deep ecologists argue, then people will take\nbetter care of nature and the world in general.\n\nAs developed by N\u00e6ss and others, the position also came to focus\non the possibility of the identification of the human ego\nwith nature. The idea is, briefly, that by identifying with nature I\ncan enlarge the boundaries of the self beyond my skin. My\nlarger\u2014ecological\u2014Self (the capital \u201cS\u201d\nemphasizes that I am something larger than my body and consciousness),\ndeserves respect as well. To respect and to care for my Self is also\nto respect and to care for the natural environment, which is actually\npart of me and with which I should identify. N\u00e6ss quotes the\nexample of Saami people and their identification with the rivers on\nwhich they depend for sustenance. Recognition of such identification\nhas underpinned the establishment in New Zealand of legal personhood\nfor some rivers and other natural areas (Kramm 2020).\n\u201cSelf-realization\u201d is thus the realization of a wider\necological Self. N\u00e6ss maintains that the deep satisfaction that\nwe receive from identification with nature and close partnership with\nother forms of life in nature contributes significantly to our life\nquality. (One historical antecedent to this kind of nature\nspiritualism is the romanticism of Jean-Jacques Rousseau as expressed\nin his last work, the Reveries of the Solitary Walker)\n\nWhen N\u00e6ss\u2019s view crossed the Atlantic, it was sometimes\nmerged with ideas emerging from Leopold\u2019s land ethic (see Devall\nand Sessions 1985; also see Sessions (ed) 1995). But\nN\u00e6ss\u2014wary of the supposed totalitarian political\nimplications of Leopold\u2019s position that individual interests and\nwell-being should be subordinated to the holistic good of the\nearth\u2019s biotic community (see section 4 below)\u2014took care\nto distance himself from advocating any sort of \u201cland\nethic\u201d. (See Anker 1999 for cautions on interpreting\nN\u00e6ss\u2019s relationalism as an endorsement of the kind of\nholism displayed in the land ethic; cf. Grey 1993, Taylor and\nZimmerman 2005). Some critics have argued that N\u00e6ss\u2019s deep\necology is no more than an extended social-democratic version of\nutilitarianism, which counts human interests in the same calculation\nalongside the interests of all natural things (e.g., trees, wolves,\nbears, rivers, forests and mountains) in the natural environment (see\nWitoszek 1997). However, N\u00e6ss failed to explain in any detail\nhow to make sense of the idea that oysters or barnacles, termites or\nbacteria could have interests of any morally relevant sort at all.\nWithout an account of this, N\u00e6ss\u2019s early \u201cbiospheric\negalitarianism\u201d\u2014that all living things whatsoever had a\nsimilar right to live and flourish\u2014was an indeterminate\nprinciple in practical terms. It also remains unclear in what sense\nrivers, mountains and forests can be regarded as possessors of any\nkind of interests. This is an issue on which N\u00e6ss always\nremained elusive.\n\nBiospheric egalitarianism was modified in the 1980s to the weaker\nclaim that the flourishing of both human and non-human life has value\nin itself, without any commitment to these values being equal. At the\nsame time, N\u00e6ss declared that his own favoured ecological\nphilosophy\u2014\u201cEcosophy T\u201d, as he called it after his\nTvergastein mountain cabin\u2014was only one of several possible\nfoundations for an environmental ethic. Deep ecology ceased to be a\nspecific doctrine, but instead became a \u201cplatform\u201d of\neight simple points on which N\u00e6ss hoped all deep green thinkers\ncould agree. The platform was conceived as establishing a middle\nground, between underlying orientations, whether indigenous,\nChristian, Buddhist, Daoist, process philosophy, or whatever, and the\npractical principles for action in specific situations, principles\ngenerated from the underlying philosophies. Thus the deep ecological\nmovement became explicitly pluralist both morally and\nepistemologically (see Brennan 1999; c.f. Light 1996, Akamani\n2020).\n\nWhile N\u00e6ss\u2019s Ecosophy T sees human Self-realization as a\nsolution to the environmental crises resulting from human selfishness\nand exploitation of nature, some of the followers of the deep ecology\nplatform in the United States and Australia further argue that the\nexpansion of the human self to include non-human nature is supported\nby the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, which is said to\nhave dissolved the boundaries between the observer and the observed\n(see Fox 1984, 1990, and Devall and Sessions 1985; cf. Callicott\n1985). These \u201crelationalist\u201d developments of deep ecology\nare, however, criticized by some feminist theorists. The idea of\nnature as part of oneself, they argue, could justify the continued\nexploitation of nature instead. For one is presumably more entitled to\ntreat oneself in whatever ways one likes than to treat another\nindependent agent in whatever ways one likes. According to these\nfeminist critics, the deep ecological theory of the \u201cexpanded\nself\u201d is in effect a disguised form of human colonialism, unable\nto give nature its due as a genuine \u201cother\u201d independent of\nhuman interest and purposes (see Plumwood 1993, Ch. 7, 1999, and\nWarren 1999).\n\nMeanwhile, other critics accuse deep ecology of being elitist in its\nattempts to preserve wilderness experiences for only a select group of\neconomically and socio-politically well-off people. Ramachandra Guha\n(1989, 1999) for instance, depicts the activities of many\nwestern-based conservation groups as a new form of cultural\nimperialism, aimed at securing converts to conservationism (cf.\nBookchin 1987 and Brennan 1998a). \u201cGreen missionaries\u201d, as\nGuha calls them, represent a movement aimed at further dispossessing\nthe world\u2019s poor and indigenous people. \u201cPutting deep\necology in its place,\u201d he writes, \u201cis to recognize that\nthe trends it derides as \u201cshallow\u201d ecology might in fact\nbe varieties of environmentalism that are more apposite, more\nrepresentative and more popular in the countries of the South.\u201d\nAlthough N\u00e6ss himself repudiates suggestions that deep ecology\nis committed to any form of imperialism (see Witoszek and Brennan\n(eds.) 1999, Ch. 36\u20137 and 41), Guha\u2019s criticism raises\nimportant questions about the application of deep ecological\nprinciples in different social, economic and cultural contexts.\nFinally, in other critiques, deep ecology is portrayed as having an\ninconsistent utopian vision (see Anker and Witoszek 1998).\n",
