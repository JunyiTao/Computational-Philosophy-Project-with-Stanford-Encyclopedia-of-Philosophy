    "main_text": "Revisions (1966\u201378) || Marx\u2019s Philosophy Redux\n5. Late work (1980\u20131986): Aleatory Materialism\n\nAfter being interrupted by ill health and by the events following from\nthe murder of his wife, in 1982 Althusser returned to the question of\nwhat was essential to Marx\u2019s philosophy and expanded the scope\nof this inquiry to include speculation about the metaphysics that must\nunderlie it. Freed by his ignoble status from the task of influencing\nthe direction of the Communist movement, the texts associated with\nthis project and gathered together in the book Philosophy of the\nEncounter differ tremendously in subject matter, style, and\nmethod from his other writings. Whether these texts represent a\ncontinuation of, or even the key to his philosophy or whether they are\nan aberration is presently being debated in the secondary literature.\nHowever, as there is strong textural and archival evidence that many\nof the ideas explicitly expressed in these works had been gestating\nfor a long time, the contention that these writings are of a piece\nwith his earlier work seems to be gaining ground.\n\nThe principal thesis of Althusser\u2019s last philosophical writings\nis that there exists an \u201cunderground\u201d or little recognized\ntradition in the history of philosophy. Variously labeled a\n\u201cmaterialism of the encounter\u201d or \u201caleatory\nmaterialism,\u201d the method which he uses to articulate this\nphilosophy is to simply comment upon works by philosophers who\nexemplify this current and to point out where, how, and to what extent\nthey do so. In addition to Marx, the philosophers that he cites as\nbeing part of this underground tradition include Democritus, Epicurus,\nLucretius, Machiavelli, Spinoza, Hobbes, Rousseau, Montesquieu,\nHeidegger, Wittgenstein, and Derrida. From these readings in the\nhistory of philosophy, Althusser aims to suggest that this tradition\nexists and that it is both philosophically fecund and viable. He also\nwishes to return to and bolster the thesis he first ventured in the\nlate 1960s that there are really only two positions in philosophy:\nmaterialism and idealism. As he understood it, the two tendencies are\nalways in a war of opposition with the one functioning to reinforce\nthe status quo and the other to possibly overcome it.\n\nPerhaps because it functions in opposition to the idealist tendency in\nphilosophy, aleatory materialism is marked almost as much by its\nrejections as it is by the positive claims it contains about the world\nand about history. As Marx is included within this tradition, it is\nnot surprising that many of these rejections are also attributed to\nhim during the course of Althusser\u2019s earlier work. These include\na dismissal of what Althusser calls \u201cthe principle of\nReason,\u201d or the idea that the universe or history has an origin\nor an end. With this prohibition, Althusser means to exclude from this\ntradition not only the usual suspects in the rationalist tradition,\nbut also mechanical and dialectical materialisms with their logics of\ndetermination. Also dismissed, he maintains, is the myth that somehow\nphilosophy and philosophers are autonomous, that they see the world\nfrom outside and objectively. Though there is an objective world,\nphilosophy does not have knowledge of this world as its object for\nthere is no way for it to ground itself and the material it thinks\nwith and through arises historically. Philosophy is therefore not a\nscience or the Science of sciences and it produces no universal Truth.\nRather, the truths it produces are contingent and are offered in\nopposition to other competing truths. If philosophy does have an\nobject, it is the void, or that which is not yet but which could\nbe.\n\nThat the philosophy of the encounter lacks an object does not mean\nthat it lacks positive propositions. However, given the\nepistemological status attributed to philosophy by Althusser, these\nmetaphysical propositions or \u201ctheses\u201d are true only\ninsofar as they have explanatory or practical value. First among them,\nfollowing Democritus, is the thesis that matter is all that exists.\nSecond is the thesis that chance or the aleatory is at the origin of\nall worlds. That the patterns which constitute and define these worlds\ncan be known, described, and predicted according to certain laws or\nreasons is also true. However, the fact that these worlds ever came to\nbe organized in these patterns is aleatory and the patterns themselves\ncan only ever be known immanently. Third, new worlds and new orders\nthemselves arise out of chance encounters between pre-existing\nmaterial elements. Whether or not such orders emerge is contingent:\nthey do not have to occur. When material elements collide, they either\n\u201ctake\u201d and a new order is founded, or they do not and the\nold world continues.\n\nTo Althusser, the propositions which have explanatory value at the\nlevel of ontology and cosmology also have value at the level of\npolitical philosophy. After first citing Rousseau and Hobbes as\nexample of philosophers who recognized that the origin and continued\nexistence of political orders is contingent, Althusser turns to\nMachiavelli and Marx for his principal examples of how aleatory\nmaterialism functions in the political realm. The anti-teleological,\nscientistic, and anti-humanist, Marxist philosophy developed by\nAlthusser over the course of his career works well with the\nmaterialist metaphysics recounted above. In this understanding of\nMarxist philosophy, societies and subjects are seen as patterns of\nactivity that behave in predictable ways. Though scientists may study\nand describe these orders in their specificity, it does not at first\nappear that philosophy can do much except to categorize these\ninteractions at the most general level. However, citing Marx\u2019s\nwork again and taking inspiration from Machiavelli\u2019s project of\ninstalling \u201ca new prince in a new principality,\u201d Althusser\nargues that the materialist philosopher may accomplish somewhat more\nthan this with her descriptions, critiques, and predictions. This is\nbecause, by examining a political order not from the perspective of\nits necessity but with an awareness of its contingency, this\nphilosopher may be able think the possibility of its transformation.\nIf chance smiles on her, if someone listens and if effects occur, then\nelements might recombine and a new political might take hold. This is,\nto be sure, a very limited and unpredictable power attributed to the\nphilosopher. However, it is also the only one that Althusser in his\nlate works argues is adequate for political practice and that does\nnot, like idealism, merely serve to reproduce existing relations.\n",
