Explanation: From Formal Analyses to Material Structures\nThe covering-law model of explanation was a centerpiece of the\nlogical empiricist conception of science. According to that model,\nexplanations are arguments showing that the event to be explained\n(the explanandum event) was to have been expected on the\nbasis of laws of nature and the antecedent and boundary conditions\n(the explanans). For advocates of the covering-law model, the\nphilosophical problem of explanation is thus largely a matter of\nanalyzing the formal structure of explanatory arguments (Hempel and\nOppenheim 1948; Hempel 1965). A rainbow, for example, is explained\nunder the covering-law model by reference to laws of reflection and\nrefraction alongside conditions concerning the position of the sun and\nthe nature of light, the position of the raindrops, and the position\nof the person seeing the rainbow. The description of the rainbow is\nthe conclusion of a deductive argument with law statements and\ndescriptions of conditions as premises, and so the rainbow was to be\nexpected in light of knowledge of the laws and conditions.\nMechanists, in contrast, insist explanation is a matter of\nelucidating the causal structures that produce, underlie, or maintain\nthe phenomenon of interest. For mechanists, the philosophical problem\nis largely about characterizing or describing the worldly or ontic\nstructures to which explanatory models (including arguments) must\nrefer if they are to count as genuinely explanatory. A rainbow, for\nthe mechanist, is explained by situating that phenomenon in the causal\nstructure of the world; the explanation is an account of how the\nphenomenon was produced by entities (like rain drops and eyeballs)\nwith particular properties (like shapes and refractive indices) that\ncausally interact with light propagating from the sun. Mechanists\ntypically distinguish several ways of situating a phenomenon within\nthe causal structure of the world.\n",
