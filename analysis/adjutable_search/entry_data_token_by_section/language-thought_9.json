    "main_text": "Arguments for LOTH || Argument from the Systematicity of Thought\n4.3 Argument from the Systematicity of Thought\n\nThere are systematic interrelations among the thoughts a thinker can\nentertain. For example, if you can entertain the thought that John\nloves Mary, then you can also entertain the thought that Mary loves\nJohn. Systematicity looks like a crucial property of human thought and\nso demands a principled explanation.\n\nRTT+COMP gives a compelling explanation. According to RTT+COMP, your\nability to entertain the thought that p hinges upon your\nability to bear appropriate psychological relations to a Mentalese\nsentence S whose meaning is that p. If you are able to\nthink that John loves Mary, then your internal system of mental\nrepresentations includes a mental sentence John loves\nMary, composed of mental words John,\nloves, and Mary\ncombined in the right way. If you have the capacity to stand in\npsychological relation A* to John loves\nMary, then you also have the capacity to stand in relation\nA* to a distinct mental sentence Mary loves\nJohn. The constituent words John, \nloves,\nand Mary make the\nsame semantic contribution to both mental sentences (John\ndenotes John, loves\ndenotes the loving relation, and Mary denotes\nMary), but the words are arranged in different constituency structures\nso that the sentences have different meanings. Whereas John\nloves Mary means that John loves Mary, Mary\nloves John means that Mary loves John. By\nstanding in relation A* to the sentence Mary\nloves John, you entertain the thought that Mary loves John.\nThus, an ability to think that John loves Mary entails an ability to\nthink that John loves Mary. By comparison, an ability to think that\nJohn loves Mary does not entail an ability to think that whales are\nmammals or an ability to think that \\(56 + 138 = 194\\).\n\nFodor (1987: 148\u2013153) supports RTT+COMP by citing its ability to\nexplain systematicity. In contrast with the productivity argument, the\nsystematicity argument does not depend upon infinitary idealizations\nthat outstrip finite performance. Note that neither argument provides\nany direct support for CTM. Neither argument even mentions\ncomputation.\n",
