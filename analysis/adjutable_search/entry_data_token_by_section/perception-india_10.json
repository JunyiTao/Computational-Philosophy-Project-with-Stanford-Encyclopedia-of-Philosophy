    "main_text": "Nirvikalpaka and Savikalpaka Pratyak\u1e63a || The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 advance in realism\n3.3 The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 advance in realism\n\nKum\u0101rila argued against the Buddhist position to show that\nperception is not always devoid of concepts. In\nPratyak\u1e63apariccheda, he principally targets\nDi\u1e45n\u0101ga\u2019s theory, while simultaneously addressing\nsome of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s ideas and arguments. Kum\u0101rila,\nlike Naiy\u0101yikas, holds both the two kinds of perception as valid.\nFor him the initial non-conceptualized perception is borne of the\nundifferentiated pure object (\u015buddhavastu) and is\ncomparable to the perception of an infant and others who lack a\nlanguage. The \u2018pure object\u2019 is the substratum for the\ngeneric and specific features of the object, but the subject is not\ndistinctly aware of any of these and simply cognizes the object as an\nindeterminate particular, as \u201cthis\u201d or\n\u201csomething\u201d. Although Kum\u0101rila agrees with the\nBuddhists that the object of immediate perception is inexpressible in\nlanguage, he maintains that it is different, in at least one respect,\nfrom the real particular (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) of the\nBuddhists; the latter being a structure-less unitary whole, whereas\nthe former is non-unitary and grasps both the particular and the\nuniversal aspects of the object. Otherwise, Kum\u0101rila argues, it\ncould not give rise to conceptual awareness, which explicitly\nidentifies such features. Di\u1e45n\u0101ga\u2019s counterpoint to\nthis is that conceptual awareness at second stage cannot be a\nperception, since it involves application of concepts and words which,\nin turn, requires memory. If we admit conceptual awareness as\nperception, we are forced to accept that a sense faculty is capable of\nremembering (since perception is a cognition brought about by the\nfunctioning of the sense faculty) but that cannot be the case because\na sense faculty, being a mere instrument of cognition, is in itself\nunconscious and cannot remember anything. Kum\u0101rila admits that\nconceptual awareness is aided by memory and concepts, but argues that\nthat does not rob it of its perceptual character for the sense faculty\nis still functioning while in contact with the very same object. He\nfurther suggests that we should not expect a perceptual cognition to\narise as soon as there is contact between a sense faculty and its\nobject. He uses the analogy of entering a dimly lit room after walking\nin the blazing sun; even though the contents of the room are directly\navailable to the sense faculties of the subject who has just walked\nin, he does not immediately apprehend the objects in front of him.\nHowever, the subject may become distinctly aware of the objects in the\nroom and their features in the following moments. The perceptual\ncharacter of the latter awareness is maintained so long as the\nconnection between the sense faculty and the object is intact, even\nwhen other conceptual awarenesses or memories intervene between the\ninitial contact with the object and the subsequent awareness. A\nconceptual awareness can be referred to as a perception even though\nthe mind, qua memory, is involved because the functioning of\nthe sense faculty is the factor responsible for arising of the\nawareness. Furthermore, he insists that the mind must be involved in\nall perceptions since it functions as a link between the sense faculty\nand the self; the sense faculty is turned on or activated by a\nconnection with the self and, the self as the subject of knowledge is\ninvolved in all cognitions. He points out that even Buddhists do not\ndeny this, since they hold that self-reflexive awareness accompanies\nevery cognition. He contends that the Buddhists are wrong to insist\nthat only a cognition arising directly from the functioning of a sense\nfaculty is perception; they agree that we perceive inner states, e.g.,\npleasure and pain, and if the mind is accepted as the operative sense\nfaculty in the self-reflexive awareness of such cognitions, it follows\nthat they should admit that the mind is also the sense faculty that\ngives rise to conceptualized cognitions. He, however, clarifies that\nnot every cognition that follows a contact between a sense faculty and\nan object is a perception, for if one were to open one\u2019s eyes\nmomentarily (in the above analogy) and construct a judgment such as\n\u201cthat was table\u201d with eyes closed again, it would not be a\nperceptual cognition since it solely depends on the memory of a\nfleeting sensory contact.\n\nLater, Dharmak\u012brti, using a methodology very different (and akin\nto proof by contradiction) from his predecessor Di\u1e45n\u0101ga,\nraises new problems for the Ny\u0101ya-M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nview. Assuming, he says, for the sake of the argument, that universals\nare real. Then the judgments \u201cThis is a cow,\u201d \u201cIt is\nan animal,\u201d relate two distinct entities, namely a particular\n(or object) and a universal (or concept) arguably via a non-relational\ntie as in being substratum and superstratum, with the proviso that the\nsubstratum object has the power to let the universal reside in it.\nThis leads to all the universals (such as cowness, animalhood, etc)\nthen being tied to the object by this simple and single power. In such\na scenario, any perceptual judgment involving the universal cowhood as\nin the case of \u201cThis is a cow\u201d makes subsequent judgments\n\u201cThis is an animal,\u201d \u201cThis is a substance,\u201d\netc., superfluous. For, if one perceives an object along with its\npower to let any one universal reside in it, one must be able to\nperceive its power to attract all other universals that reside in it.\nThus, there would be no distinction between \u201cThis is a\ncow\u201d and \u201cThis is a substance\u201d; clearly an\nunacceptable thesis. Matilal (1986, 326) notes two points in\nconnection with this argument. First, Dharmak\u012brti assumes that an\nobject, or a unique particular, is perceived in its entirety and no\npart of it is left unperceived. Second, the realist has objectified\nall the universals including the relation-universal. If, as the\nrealist believes, the object of perception\u2014the\nparticular\u2014has the power to accommodate all universals in it,\nthen the onus is on him to show why only a single universal manifests\nitself in a perceptual judgment. This concern is pertinent, especially\nagainst the Ny\u0101ya philosophers who admit only one single\nrelation-universal: inherence, which supposedly unites all nesting\nuniversals with the object. The Naiy\u0101yikas readily respond to\nthis argument by pointing out that the redundancy objection rests on\nDharmakirti\u2019s assumption that an object is grasped in its\nentirety in perception. This assumption is false; perception is\nperspectival, we never see all sides of an ordinary three-dimensional\nobject, but we still see it.\n\nFurthermore, Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s argues that conceptual or\njudgmental awareness is phenomenologically distinct from\nnon-conceptual awareness. In the latter we are confronted with the\nobject of perception which is vivid and immediate, while in the former\nno object is present. In the judgment \u201cthis is a cow\u201d,\neven the \u2018subject\u2019 of the judgment does not refer to the\nobject of perception, since words do not refer to perceived\nparticulars but to universals which extend across space and time.\nDharmak\u012brti admits that the words we apply to things have some\nobjective basis in those things; we call something a cow because it\nhas a certain effect, it gives milk, is gentle, or it calls forth a\ncertain cognition, etc. This effect, in turn, inclines us to associate\nthe word \u2018cow\u2019 with other things that have the same effect\nand we do that by jointly dissociating them from things that lack that\neffect. Universals, according to the Buddhists are arbitrarily\nconstructed \u201cexclusions\u201d (apoha); words serve the\npurpose of separating things off from other objects. For example, the\nword \u2018cow\u2019 singles out a class of things by excluding them\nfrom things they are not, all things assembled together under the\nconcept \u2018cow\u2019 are distinct from each other and do not\nshare a single nature that the word \u2018cow\u2019 names. A\nconceptual awareness insofar as it imputes a word to a particular\nobject and, therefore a universal nature it shares with all others of\nthe same universal-kind, essentially falsifies the object.\nKum\u0101rila objects to the Buddhists theory of universals\n(apoha) on the grounds that it is counterintuitive and\ncircular. The theory of universals (apoha) contradicts our\nintuition that meaning of a positive word is positive; there is\nnothing negative about the word \u2018cow\u2019. A negative entity\ncan be the meaning of a word only where something is negated.\nMoreover, if we accept that understanding x requires\neliminating non-x, then in turn we presuppose knowledge of\nnon-x, which entails an understanding of non-non-x,\nand so on (Drefyus, 1997, 215). The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas also\ntake on board the concerns raised by the Naiy\u0101yika philosopher\nUddyotakara (c. 7th century CE), who questions the theory of\nexclusions on the specific grounds that it fails to offer an adequate\ntheory of reference and relation between concepts and reality. He\nargues if the word \u2018cow\u2019 primarily designates a negative\nentity, either this entity is a cow in disguise or is different from a\ncow. If it is a cow in disguise then the Buddhist view of universals\nis no different from the Ny\u0101ya common sense realism that words\nare used to single out phenomena in the world. If the negative entity\nis different from a cow, then the word \u2018cow\u2019 does not\nrefer to real cows, making it difficult to explain how any word can\nrefer to real objects or classes thereof. This last point begs the\nquestion because the Buddhist denies that words refer to the objects\nin the real world. For him words refer to universals, and that is\nprecisely what the world does not contain. The onus is put\nback on the realists to show that universals, which serve as meanings\nof words, are real properties of objects rather than imagined or\nmentally constructed features. This challenge is taken up by the\nNaiy\u0101yikas and their position against the nominalist stand of\nboth the Buddhists and the Grammarians is presented later below.\n",
