    "main_text": "Thought || Sokushinj\u014dbutsu: Enlightenment via Embodiment\n3.9 Sokushinj\u014dbutsu: Enlightenment via Embodiment\n\nOne of the most distinguishing characteristic of K\u016bkai\u2019s\nBuddhist thought is his concept of sokushinj\u014dbutsu, the\nattainment of enlightenment in this very embodied existence. This idea\nof sokushinj\u014dbutsu represents the apex of\nK\u016bkai\u2019s synthesis of Buddhist theoria and\npraxis. The doctrine itself is not explicit in the two major\nesoteric s\u016btras, the Dainichiky\u014d and the\nKong\u014dch\u014dgy\u014d. The idea first appears rather in\nI-hsing\u2019s commentary on the Dainichiky\u014d\n(Ta-jih Ching Su; Commentary on the Mah\u0101vairocana\nS\u016btra). K\u016bkai was the first however to provide the idea\nwith a systematic explication in his Sokushinj\u014dbutsugi,\nwhich has been regarded by commentators as the most important of his\nphilosophical expositions. K\u016bkai\u2019s appropriation and\nsystematic development of the theory takes the form of a unique\nphilosophy of praxis that is simultaneously a philosophy of\nthe body.\n\nThe phrase sokushinj\u014dbutsu means literally,\n\u201cattaining enlightenment in this very body\u201d or\n\u201cbecoming buddha in this very body.\u201d \u201cBody\u201d\n(shin) \u2013 as K\u016bkai explains in\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi, ch. 6 \u2013 here is not merely\none\u2019s corporeal body but one\u2019s lived embodied existence of\nbody-and-mind as one whole. In addition \u201cbody\u201d here takes\non myriad significances when one views sokushinj\u014dbutsu\nin light of K\u016bkai\u2019s other concepts such as hosshin\nsepp\u014d and sanmitsu. Sokushin (\u201cthis\nbody\u201d), for example, can signify the cosmos of the\nhokkai as the macrocosmic body of the hosshin with\nwhich one\u2019s own embodiment is non-dualistic. It can mean each of\nthe six universal elements or all of them together that comprise the\ncosmic body and its samadhi. It can also mean the four\nembodiments of the hosshin. It can mean the bodies of all\nliving things other than one\u2019s self. In correspondence with the\n\u201cthree mysteries\u201d of body, speech, and mind, or\nmudra, mantra, and mandala, it can mean bodily gestural\nsymbols (in), figures of letters (ji), and\nexpressive demeanor or countenance (g\u014d). All of these\nsenses of \u201cbody\u201d are interrelated and inseparable,\nmutually mirroring one another.\n\nShingon has inherited much of the metaphysics of Chinese\nMah\u0101y\u0101na thought: e.g., the equation of hosshin and\nhokkai, traceable to Hua-yen Buddhism; and the equation of\nthe hosshin with the universal Buddha-nature inherent in all\nbeings as their \u201coriginal enlightenment\u201d, traceable to\nT\u2019ien-t\u2019ai (Tiantai; Jpn: Tendai) Buddhism. Combining\nthese Mah\u0101y\u0101na equations, in Shingon, the embodiment of the\nDharma equals the cosmos as the realm of truth, the Dharma, which in\nturn means the inherent universal original enlightenment (honnu\nhongaku) in all beings. But what distinguishes K\u016bkai\u2019s\nthought is in his focus upon the body and its concrete practice. The\ncosmos is the \u201cbody of truth\u201d and our own bodies take part\nin that cosmic body. It is this bodily aspect, as a universal medium\nor plenum that allows for the concretization of universal\nenlightenment to be realized through ritualized bodily experience.\nBoth Hua-yen and T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai had similar notions of\nuniversal original enlightenment although that idea was quite new to\nJapan at the time. But what they lacked was any concrete ritual means\nfor realizing that enlightenment aside from basic meditation.\nK\u016bkai contended that their teachings were thus lacking in the\narea of practice. His emphasis upon a bodily ritual praxis\nthat cohered with scriptural doctrine provided them with\nsoteriological \u2013 rather than just magico-secular \u2013\nsignificance. This helped to bridge the gap between theory and\npractice, doctrine and ritual, that was previously left unexplained by\nthe orthodox Nara schools of Buddhism. As a consequence of his\nexplication of sokushinj\u014dbutsu, K\u016bkai thus provided\nboth a coherent explanation of the relationship between\ntheory and practice, and a concrete method for realizing\nthrough bodily experience those teachings, a practical method for\nrealizing what Mah\u0101y\u0101na already taught in China as\nhongaku.\n\nK\u016bkai\u2019s claim was that this esoteric method of\nritual-bodily-meditational practice \u2013 involving the three media\n(or \u201cmysteries\u201d) of body, speech, and mind \u2013 will\nallow one to realize one\u2019s direct embodied participation in the\nDharmic samadhi of the hosshin, i.e.,\n\u201cenlightenment in this very embodied existence\u201d\n(sokushinj\u014dbutsu). The lack of any systematic esoteric\nritual practice in exoteric Buddhism \u2013 from K\u016bkai\u2019s\nperspective, their rituals were unsystematized, haphazard \u2013,\nfails to lead to immediate enlightenment. Moreover the orthodox\nteaching of the exoteric schools was that it would take innumerable\nrebirths of training until one could attain Buddhahood. K\u016bkai\ninstead claimed that esoteric Buddhism, with its rituals and\nmeditational methods, can lead one, regardless of karmic\ndispositions, to instant enlightenment \u201cin this very\nbody.\u201d Through yogic and mantric practices\ninvolving the body, the practitioner was to eliminate all attachments\nto the substantiality of self and of things and to their\ndichotomization \u2013 this for the sake of immediately realizing\nnon-duality with the hosshin. In this way the idea of\nsokushinj\u014dbutsu is put forth as a major distinguishing\ncharacteristic of esoteric from exoteric Buddhism, demonstrating the\npossibility of attaining enlightenment in one\u2019s\npresently embodied existence in distinction from the long and\ngradual process over countless aeons of rebirths as taught by the\nexoteric schools.\n\nFor K\u016bkai this bodily and concrete nature of the realization of\noriginal enlightenment, which he so emphasized, is ultimately\npredicated upon the fact that one\u2019s self and Buddha are\nnon-dualistic, that man in his very embodied existence \u2013 that\nis, in body-and-mind \u2013 is already a micro-cosmic mirror of the\nhosshin. We next turn to this aspect of man\u2019s mirroring\nof the Buddha, which simultaneously is also the Buddha\u2019s\nsalvific helping of man.\n3.10 Kaji: Macro-Micro-Cosmic Co-Respondence\n\nThe realization of enlightenment cannot be attained on one\u2019s\nown. For one is not a substantial, i.e., ontologically independent,\nbeing to begin with. As the cosmos itself is a web of interdependently\noriginating thing-events, nothing can stand alone to claim complete\nself-sufficiency. The same interdependency that obtains horizontally\nbetween the constituents of the cosmos also obtains vertically. That\nis, the whole is what it is in virtue of its parts just as the parts\nare what they are in partaking of the whole. The realization of\nenlightenment then as an event, as well as the relative degrees of\nspiritual development, entails a micro-cosmic and macro-cosmic\ncorrelativity. This is expressed in Sokushinj\u014dbutsugi,\nch. 5, in K\u016bkai\u2019s notion of kaji (Skrt:\nadhisth\u0101na), which has been variously translated as\n\u201cempowerment\u201d or \u201cgrace.\u201d In religious (or\ndevotional) terms, this is explained to involve both the\nBuddha\u2019s great compassion and the practitioner\u2019s piety,\ndevotion, or faith, which in their correspondence, act together in the\nattainment of enlightenment. But one must keep in mind that\nkaji in itself is not necessarilly enlightenment because the\nempowerment is in proportion to the level of spirituality attained by\nthe practitioner. Through such mutuality, one\u2019s own effort\npartakes in the omnipresencing of the hosshin, realized in\nvarious degrees. This mutuality is expressed in the meanings\nof the two characters that make up kaji: Ka,\nliterally meaning \u201cadding\u201d or \u201cincreasing,\u201d is\nexplained to be the Buddha\u2019s compassion that pours down upon,\nentering into, the practitioner\u2019s mind (shin) like\nsunrays on water. And ji, literally meaning\n\u201cretaining\u201d or \u201cholding,\u201d is explained to\nrefer to the practitioner\u2019s mind that keeps a-hold of, absorbs,\nthe compassion just as water retains and reflects the sunlight.\nKa is the gift that Dainichi gives; and\nji is our acknowledgment of that gift by cherishing\nit. Practically speaking this becomes expressed in the bodily ritual\ntraining that the practitioners undergo as they strive to ascend\n\u201cupwards,\u201d to meet Dainichi\u2019s compassionate descent\n\u201cdownwards.\u201d In the terminology that becomes later\npopularized with Pure Land Buddhism, this would signify a mutuality\nand non-duality between self-power (jiriki) and other-power\n(tariki). The two movements are aspects of a single movement\nof enlightenment. In other words, one\u2019s own striving is\nthe \u201cgrace\u201d of the Buddha helping one towards\nenlightenment. But this cannot simply be construed to mean one\u2019s\nreliance upon other-power but entails that one must appropriate that\n\u201cgrace\u201d in self-power. This mutuality of kaji is\nalso expressed in K\u016bkai\u2019s phrase, ny\u016bga\ngany\u016b (\u201c[Buddha] entering into me, and I entering\n[into Buddha]\u201d).\n\nKaji is realized as one becomes aware of one\u2019s self and\nactivity as the micro-cosmic manifestation of the macro-cosmic\nactivity and mystery of the cosmos itself. One could then also say\nthat kaji expresses the mutuality and coherence or\nco-responding that obtains between the two major concepts\ncharacterizing esoteric Buddhism for K\u016bkai: hosshin\nsepp\u014d and sokushinj\u014dbutsu, as two ways of\nconceiving from different angles the same interrelationality of the\ncosmos in its mantric and mandalic expressions. That is to\nsay, in the mantric and mandalic nature of this\ninterrelationality, the Buddha\u2019s hosshin sepp\u014d on\nthe one hand descends from the summit and spreads-out from the center,\nand the practitioner\u2019s sokushinj\u014dbutsu on the\nother hand raises him from below and gravitates him to the center.\nTheir simultaneity means their non-duality as different aspects of the\nsame dynamism of a cosmic emptiness. To realize this, is to affirm\none\u2019s own original enlightenment in one\u2019s present body in\nsimultaneous reception of Dainichi\u2019s expounding of the\nDharma.\n3.11 Sanmitsu: The Three Mysteries\n\nThe \u201ctrue words\u201d (mantra) preached by Dainichi,\nas we have already seen, are equated with the dynamism of the cosmos\nitself, which includes our own mental and bodily experiences. The\nBuddha\u2019s preaching through every phenomenon is classified by\nK\u016bkai in terms of the three forms of bodily, verbal, and mental\nactivities, or the three media of mudra (ingei),\nmantra, and mandala, i.e., Dainichi\u2019s cosmic gestural language,\nphonic language, and imaging language. Dainichi expresses the\nself-enjoyment of his enlightenment in these three functions of bodily\ngestures (mudras), the intoning of sounds (mantras), and\nvisualizing-thinking (mandalas). Since the cosmos is Dainichi\u2019s\nbody-and-mind, his deeds, words, and thoughts (or visualizations) form\nthe configurations, resonances, and patterns of the universe, in these\nthree media of \u201cbody, speech, and mind,\u201d called the\n\u201cthree mysteries.\u201d All visible and/or tangible forms and\nmovements constitute the Buddha\u2019s body and its movements, all\nsounds are his voice, and the mind\u2019s comprehension of this\nprinciple is the manifestation of the Dharma in mandalic form\nexpressing the Buddha\u2019s state-of-mind. That is, all objects of\nthe six senses make up the configurations, resonances, and patterns of\nthe cosmos, the cosmic body-and-mind of the Buddha Dainichi,\ncommunicating the Dharma. As K\u016bkai explains in his\nUnjigi, the three mysteries are in every single phenomenon,\npassing through all stages of being without discrimination, including\nstones, plants, trees, animals, humans, gods, demons, and places. Each\nof these serves as a \u201clinguistic\u201d medium that communicates\nDainichi\u2019s sermon in his omnipresencing, a sermon of the Dharma\nwhich cannot be expressed or described by means of the mundane human\nlanguages.\n\nAs these three media are in fact different expressions of the same\nDharma, they are not independent of each other. For example, the\nmantra is an expression of the mandala in sound, and conversely, the\nmandala conveys in pictures what the mantra intones. Together they\nconvey in visual form and in audible sound, the meaning of the Dharma.\nThrough these three media, sentient beings are thus aroused from their\nignorance to realize their own enlightenment.\n\nImplaced within this vibrating cosmos, we are all then taking part in\nDainichi\u2019s bodily, verbal, and mental activities as\n\u201coriginally enlightened,\u201d non-dualistic with the Buddha.\nOn the basis of kaji, which we discussed above, the three\nmysteries of the hosshin and the three corresponding forms of\nactivities of sentient beings inter-permeate. That is, our own bodily,\nverbal, and mental activities are already expressions of the three\nmysteries of the hosshin. This inter-permeation is hence\n\u201calways already,\u201d and yet what is lacking for the most\npart is our awareness of it that would realize it. That is why\nK\u016bkai, following the Dainichiky\u014d, prescribes the\nritual practice of bodily acts, verbal acts, and mental acts. Bodily\nacts involve mudra-formations \u2013 these are complex\nseries of gestural movements of the hands and fingers in coordination\nwith mantra-chanting and visualizations \u2013, meditative bodily\npostures, and the handling of ritual instruments. Verbal acts involve\nmantra-recitations and other forms of prayer formulas or chants and\nverses (dh\u0101ran\u012bs). And mental acts involve\nvisualizing or focussing upon mandalas or the figures of Sanskrit\nmantra letters as well as visualizations (kans\u014d,\nkannen) of deities or buddhas \u2013 a realization of self\nand world in the sense of both transformation and\nawakening as their fruit. Together with ingei\n(mudra) and shingon (mantra), the\npractitioner\u2019s kans\u014d allows the mandalic structure\ninseparable from the insight attained in such practice \u2013 an\n\u201cimage\u201d that in itself is visually unrepresentable and\nhence irreducible to the visual mandalic icon \u2013 to unfold. The\nthree acts are performed simultaneously in a practice wherein the\npractitioner utters a mantra, forms mudras, and visualizes\ntheir form and meditates their meaning and lets his mind abide in\nsamadhi, all at the same time. \n\nThe point of Shingon practice is to intentionally accord with, or\ninter-resonate with, Dainichi\u2019s movements, mirroring the\nmacrocosmic world in one\u2019s own microcosm. Thereby original\nenlightenment is realized in one\u2019s very own embodied dynamism of\nbodily, verbal, and mental acts. Shingon ritual meditative practice,\nas such, involving all three activities is meant to intentionally\nexpress the realization of one\u2019s participation in the cosmic\nmantra language of the hosshin. This practice then provides\nthe means of penetrating Dainichi\u2019s cosmic mantric language so\nthat one may directly comprehend and experientially verify hosshin\nsepp\u014d. By making use of all of the faculties of one\u2019s\nembodied existence \u2013 thinking, feeling, sensing, acting,\nvisualizing, etc. \u2013, one is led via kaji to comprehend\nthe Dharma, not merely conceptually or intellectually but through\none\u2019s body-and-mind. In non-duality with the Buddha\u2019s\ncosmic embodiment, one\u2019s own three human activities (Srkt:\ntrikarma; Jpn: sang\u014d) \u2013 bodily, verbal,\nand mental \u2013 immediately become experienced as the\nBuddha\u2019s own acts, the three cosmic mysteries, as immanent to\none\u2019s self. Thereby one is now intentionally participating in\nthe yoga or samadhi of Dainichi, thus realizing\none\u2019s own original enlightenment. In this state called\n\u201csecret\u201d or \u201cmysterious samadhi\u201d\n(himitsu sanmaji) or \u201csecret meditation\u201d\n(himitsu zen), with the help of kaji, the\nintegration between man\u2019s \u201cthree acts\u201d and\nBuddha\u2019s \u201cthree mysteries\u201d is realized, and Buddha\n\u201centers me and I enter\u201d Buddha. As one\u2019s mind thus\nbecomes enlightened and one\u2019s body becomes\n\u201cadamantine,\u201d one attains Buddhahood. (See\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi, ch.5) In bodily-mental co-respondence\nwith the hosshin\u2019s omnipresencing via the\nthree mysteries, K\u016bkai claims, the non-duality between self and\nBuddha is thus realized immediately in one\u2019s embodied existence,\nthus sokushinj\u014dbutsu.\n\nWith successful completion, this practice of the three mysteries,\nwhich initially has the aspect of \u201cwith form\u201d\n(us\u014d) \u2013 that is, in rituals \u2013, comes to\noccur naturally, no longer restricted to its ritualized context. That\nis, the individual\u2019s every action in daily life, without ritual\nform (mus\u014d), comes to intentionally reflect the\nenlightened body-and-mind of the Buddha and its three mysteries. Every\nword uttered is thus a mantra, every bodily movement a mudra,\nand every thought samadhi. It is in this culmination of\nbodily practice, that all of K\u016bkai\u2019s major concepts,\nhosshin sepp\u014d, hongaku, sanmitsu,\nsokushinj\u014dbutsu, ny\u016bga gany\u016b,\nconverge in the attainment of Buddhahood. While from the Shingon\nesoteric perspective, this attainment is instant, from another\nperspective, viewed in light of all other (i.e., exoteric) doctrines,\nthe attainment is gradual and relative. We now turn to this final\ntopic in our discussion of K\u016bkai, the development of the mind\nthrough ten states from the animal to the enlightened.\n3.12 Ten States in the Development of the Mind\n\nBy 830 K\u016bkai has shifted his interest from an earlier focus upon\nthe controversy between Madhaymaka and Yog\u0101c\u0101ra concerning\nthe emptiness or existence of the dharmas and his critique of their\nview on language as not conveying truth (the Dharma), to evaluating\nBuddhist doctrines as a whole, including the other major Buddhist\nschools. This shift is most likely connected to the dispute on-going\nduring that period between the founder of the Tendai school,\nSaich\u014d, and the older Nara Buddhist schools. In providing a\ncomprehensive scheme that would explain the place of each religious\nteaching as well as the place of esoteric Buddhism in relation to the\nother Buddhist doctrines, K\u016bkai aimed to demonstrate the\nsignificance of his version of Buddhism.\n\nIn this scheme, K\u016bkai is adamant in using the above-discussed\nconcepts to distinguish esoteric from exoteric Buddhism. And yet,\ngiven a bird\u2019s eye view, the truth, the Dharma, in\nK\u016bkai\u2019s scheme is encompassing enough to include exoteric\nBuddhism and all other teachings as its unfoldings or manifestations,\nin relative degrees in accordance with the appropriate circumstance or\ncontext and the level of attainment. In order to explain the different\nlevels or states (j\u016b, literally \u201cdwellings\u201d\nor \u201clodgings\u201d) of mind (j\u016bj\u016bshin) that\ncorrespond to the various doctrines of other schools and religious\nsects, K\u016bkai developed an hierarchical scheme. Shingon Buddhism\nis placed at the top of the hierarchy as providing the most\ncomprehensive view to the Dharma. K\u016bkai provides this\nsystematization in what many consider to be his magnum opus,\nHimitsu mandara j\u016bj\u016bshinron (Treatise on the\nSecret Mandala of the Ten States of Mind) in ten volumes,\ncomposed around 830, five years before his death. It was written in\nresponse to an order of Emperor Junna that each Buddhist sect present\nan introductory treatise of its teachings. When the text proved to be\ntoo difficult for the emperor, K\u016bkai produced an abridged and\nmore accessible treatise on the same theme, Hiz\u014d\nh\u014dyaku (Precious Key to the Secret Treasury) in\nthree volumes. At the core of both works is this classification of the\nvarious doctrines whereby each is critically evaluated under the light\nof the culminating and most comprehensive view of Shingon. A similar\nsort of system of classifying doctrines, called\np\u2019an-chiao (panjiao) or chiao-pan\n(jiaoban) (Jpn: ky\u014ds\u014d hanjaku or\nky\u014d-han) already existed in China, e.g. within the\nT\u2019ien-t\u2019ai and the Hua-yen traditions. Such a system of\nclassification proved helpful in their attempts to distinguish\nthemselves from, and at the same time, incorporate previous doctrines\nas expedient means that are relatively true. The Lotus\nS\u016btra had also already expressed the similar idea that\nvarious doctrines were meant as expedient means that lead eventually\nto a fuller truth (expressed within its own text). It is\nK\u016bkai\u2019s own invention however to associate the different\ndoctrines evaluated and classified with specific states of mind or\nstages of spiritual attainment. That is, each state in the development\nof the mind is correlated with a specific set of doctrines appropriate\nto it, as its perspective and lived experience of reality, true to a\ncertain extent within its limited purview but not yet the whole truth\nuntil the final state is reached. In other words, to move up this\nhierarchy of levels of mind, is to experience the unfolding of the\nDharma as one becomes further awakened until one fully realizes\none\u2019s enlightenment in non-duality with the Dharma itself, i.e.\nthe attainment of Buddha-hood. From a mandalic perspective, this\nunfolding of the Dharma is also indicative of one\u2019s evolution\nfrom the periphery towards the center of the mandalic universe.\nHowever as each level of mind is a \u201cdwelling\u201d or\n\u201clodging\u201d place for the mind, the hierarchy from the\nlowest to the highest \u201cstages\u201d is sequential only in the\nexoteric dimension. That is to say that the sequential ordering is not\nnecessary in itself when viewed from the esoteric, i.e., holistic,\nstandpoint. In other words, it is possible to move directly from any\nstate or \u201cdwelling\u201d to the most comprehensive realm.\n\nThe teachings evaluated here not only include Buddhist schools but\nalso variations of Brahmanism, Hinduism, and Indian religious\npractices as well as Chinese non-Buddhist doctrines. And the Buddhist\nteachings include the major Indian and Chinese doctrines that have\nmade their way to Japan: Ritsu (Chn. Lu-tsung, Vinaya studies), Kusha\n(based on Abhidharma), J\u014djitsu (Skrt. Satyasiddhi, based on\nSautr\u0101ntika), Hoss\u014d (Skrt. Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, Chn.\nFa-hsiang), Sanron (Chn. San-lun based on Indian Madhyamaka), Tendai\n(Ch. T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai), Kegon (Chn. Hua-yen), and Shingon.\nK\u016bkai\u2019s classification system may be briefly summarized in\nthe following schema:\n\n1st to 3rd states: Pre-Buddhist stages: worldly\n\u201cvehicles\u201d of samsaric entrapment:\n\n1st state: \u201cThe mind of the goat foolishly\ntransmigrating in the six destinies (or realms)\u201d (ish\u014d\nteiy\u014d-shin): The state of desire driven by animal instincts\nwithout moral restraint; the stage to which belong common people,\nhell-beings, hungry-ghosts, beasts, asuras\n(\u201ctitans\u201d), and various deities or celestial beings\ntrapped in their samsaric destinies.\n\n2nd state: \u201cThe mind of the child tempered but\nignorantly obsessed with moral precepts\u201d (gud\u014d\njisai-shin): The state of ethical actions and virtue that promote\nsocial order but without any \u201creligious\u201d goal; the stage\nto which belong Confucianism and the Buddhist precepts\n(ritsu) for the laity.\n\n3rd state: \u201cThe mind of the child composed and\nfearing nothing\u201d (yod\u014d mui-shin): The state of\ndeity worship and extrinsic magico-religious practice for the sake of\novercoming anxiety with the thought of attaining supernatural powers\nor immortality, or reaching an eternal and blissful heaven; the stage\nto which belong Taoism and various forms of Hinduism or\nBrahmanism.\n\n4th to 10th states: Buddhist stages (the fourth\nto ninth being exoteric Buddhism and the tenth being esoteric\nBuddhism):\n\n4th to 5th states: Hin\u0101y\u0101na stages:\n\u201cvehicles\u201d of those who aspire towards self-enlightenment\nwithout caring for the enlightenment of others.\n\n4th state: \u201cThe mind of one affirming only the\nelements and negating the self\u201d (yuiun muga-shin): The\nstate of the \u015br\u0101vaka who analyzes phenomena into\nthe psycho-physical \u201caggregates\u201d (skandhas)\nand/or the elements (dharmas), to thus negate any belief in a\npermanent ego (atman); the stage to which belong the\nteachings of the historical Buddha and his direct disciples and of the\nAbhidharma scholastics. While the substantiality of reality\nis thus deconstructed into its elemental dharmas, the\ndharmas themselves however become fetters, thus taking from\nthree lives to sixty aeons to achieve liberation.\n\n5th state: \u201cThe mind freed from karmic seeds\u201d\n(batsu g\u014dinju-shin): The state of the\npratyeka-buddhas, who, masterless on their own, attain\ninsight into the chain of dependent origination to recognize the\nimpermanence, self-less-ness, and non-substantiality of all, thus\npreventing new karma to arise. But in enjoying a certain level of\n\u201cenlightenment,\u201d they fall back into the\n\u201cegoism\u201d of self-complacency, compassionless apathy\ntowards fellow beings, and the narrow vision of other-worldliness.\nHence they have not yet reached complete enlightenment. The\nSautr\u0101ntika school belongs to this stage.\n\n6th to 9th states: Mah\u0101y\u0101na stages:\n\u201cvehicles\u201d of the bodhisattvas, those who seek\nenlightenment both for self and for others, by overcoming self-other\nduality and recognizing the interdependency between self-enlightenment\nand other-enlightenment and between wisdom and compassion.\n\n6th state: \u201cThe mind of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nadherent who is concerned with others\u201d (taen\ndaij\u014d-shin): The state of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra with its\nVij\u00f1apti-m\u0101trat\u0101 (Jpn: yuishiki)\nstandpoint that everything is \u201cmind-only,\u201d reached by its\nanalysis of thing-events as phenomena of consciousness originating\nfrom a deep un-conscious \u201cstorehouse\u201d or \u201creceptacle\nconsciousness\u201d (\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na). Its\npoint is to detach oneself from the discriminating objectification of\nphenomena in order to realize the tranquility of\n\u201cmind-only\u201d from a non-discriminating perspective, which\nwould allow the practice of \u201cgreat compassion.\u201d And yet\nthis still takes several aeons of practice to achieve and is not the\nfinal state.\n\n7th state: \u201cThe mind of one who realizes\nnon-origination\u201d (kakushin fush\u014d-shin): The state\nof Madhyamaka with its \u015b\u016bnyav\u0101da (Jpn:\nk\u016bgan) standpoint that everything is empty. Here\nreifying and substantializing conceptions \u2013 including both\nobjects and mind \u2013 that act as fetters are eliminated through\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s eight-fold negations which via\ntheir dependent origination show their emptiness.\n\n8th state: \u201cThe mind of one who realizes harmony with\nthe one path of truth\u201d (nyojitsu ichid\u014d-shin or\nichid\u014d muishin): The state of T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai\nwith its standpoint of \u201coneness of all,\u201d wherein one\nrealizes that one moment contains eternity, a single thought contains\nall possible worlds, and a sesame seed contains a mountain, i.e. the\nnon-duality between one and many; and between emptiness, dependent\norigination, and their \u201cmiddle.\u201d\n\n9th state: \u201cThe mind of one who realizes the absence\nof substance within ultimate truth\u201d (goku\nmujish\u014d-shin): The state of Hua-yen with its standpoint of\nthe mutual non-obstruction and interpenetration between the\npatternment (Chn: li; Jpn: ri) of all and the\nconcrete thing-events (Chn: shih; Jpn: ji) on the\nbasis of their emptiness, whereby one and many are non-dualistic. This\nnon-duality is extended to the level of the entire\ndharmadh\u0101tu.\n\n10th state: Both Tendai and Kegon for K\u016bkai however\nlack the crucial element of direct experiential understanding to truly\nrealize what they preach. One must thus proceed further by means of\nbodily ritual practice provided by the next and final state:\nMantray\u0101na: \u201cThe mind of secret sublimity\u201d\n(himitsu sh\u014dgon-shin). This is the state of Shingon,\nwhose esoteric teachings and bodily experiential practice constitute\nthe summit of the development of the mind. At this summit hosshin\nsepp\u014d is revealed and one attains\nsokushinj\u014dbutsu through the micro-macro-cosmic\ncorrelativity of the three mysteries and through kaji. \n\nRather than rejecting or negating the previous states, this final\nstate fulfills and encompasses their standpoints from what is claimed\nto be the most comprehensive standpoint, in view of \u2013 or rather\nin non-duality with \u2013 the Dharma. In light of the Dharma, the\ntruths taught in those previous states are but relative or provisional\ntruths, expedient means that are helpful only insofar as they lead one\ntowards this final truth but which can also serve as fetters if one\nbecomes attached to them. Each state is referred to as a\n\u201cpalace\u201d (ky\u016b or g\u016b), which\nare all combined in the one grand cosmic palace\n(hokkaig\u016b or hokkai shinden). This grand palace\nconstitutes the entire cosmos as a mandala, with the tenth and highest\nstate, the innermost secret palace of Dainichi, at the center and\nsummit from which the Dharma emanates into its various manifestations\nin the lower states, the outer palaces. The closer one is to the\ncenter, the stronger one feels the pull of kaji drawing one\nup towards the central summit. But as stated above, the sequential\nordering of the hierarchy is not necessary when the whole is viewed\nfrom this most comprehensive standpoint. For the grand cosmic palace\npenetrates and comprehends all of the specific palaces or dwellings of\nthe mind. Hence one can make a sudden leap from any point in this\ncosmic mandala towards the center by successfully engaging in the\nesoteric practice of Shingon Buddhism. It is this mandalic structure\nthat the term mandala in the title of the longer version of\nthis work (Treatise on the Secret Mandala of the Ten States of\nMind) signifies. It refers to the blueprint of the cosmic\nembodiment of the Dharma (hosshin), which in turn structures\none\u2019s (ritual) practice in its arrangement and how one\naccordingly experiences the Dharma.\n4. Concluding Remarks\n\nAmong the better known philosophers of the Kyoto School, references to\nK\u016bkai or Shingon, when compared to Zen or Pure Land Buddhism, are\nhardly noticeable. It has been suggested that this neglect may have\nsomething to do with an intellectual\u2019s prejudice against the\n\u201cesoteric,\u201d e.g. the significance of ritual with its\nsymbols and images, which are not so easily amenable to rational\ncomprehension and instead conjure up preconceptions of the\n\u201coccult\u201d and the \u201cmagical.\u201d However the\nphilosophical aspects of Shingon Buddhism are often traceable to the\nsame Mah\u0101y\u0101na seeds that sprouted Zen. Once such prejudices\nare overcome, it would not be so difficult for the contemporary\nphilosopher to find in K\u016bkai a well-spring of ideas and thoughts\nwhich may be of interest today.\n\nWe need to acknowledge, however, that K\u016bkai and Shingon Buddhism\nin general have not altogether been ignored by contemporary\nphilosophers of Japan. Even within the Kyoto School, its current\nrepresentative Ueda Shizuteru in a 1993 lecture, Basho to\nmandara, discusses the significance of mandalas in Shingon\nBuddhism in relation to the ontological structure of human existence\nunderstood in his terms as being-in-the-twofold-world. In his analysis\nof K\u016bkai\u2019s mandalas, Ueda approriates contemporary\nphilosophical concepts, such as Nishida\u2019s \u201cplace\u201d\n(basho), Nishitani\u2019s \u201cfield\u201d (ba),\nand Heidegger\u2019s \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d\n(In-der-Welt-sein), and takes the mandala as indicative of\nthe always assumed semantic space (imi k\u016bkan) belonging\nto the world (sekai) as the total framework of meanings\n(imi no waku gumi) wherein we find ourselves. A couple of\nother graduates of Kyoto University\u2019s philosophy department have\nentire books on K\u016bkai. In K\u016bkai no shis\u014d ni\ntsuite, Umehara Takeshi discusses K\u016bkai both as a religious\npractitioner and as a theorist, who explicates the world\u2019s\ninfinite \u201ctreasure\u201d unfolding within the self. And\nex-Nishidian turned Marxist, Yanagida Kenj\u016br\u014d, has a study\non K\u016bkai and his works: Nihon shingon no tetsugaku:\nK\u016bkai Hiz\u014dh\u014dyaku to Ben\u2019kenmitsu\nniky\u014dron.\n\nAmong other twentieth century Japanese philosophers, Yuasa Yasuo,\nknown for his theory of the body, often refers to the doctrines and\npractices of Shingon Buddhism, and has writen entire chapters on\nK\u016bkai in Shintairon: T\u014dy\u014dteki shinshin ron to\ngendai and The Body: Towards an Eastern Mind-Body\nTheory. Comparative philosopher of religion, Izutsu Toshihiko, as\nwell, in Ishiki to honshitsu and other works, has found\nK\u016bkai\u2019s ideas \u2013 especially his\ncosmological-linguistic theory \u2013 inspiring enough to incorporate\ninto his own theory of essence as part of his attempt to build a\nsynthetic \u201cOriental philosophy\u201d (t\u014dy\u014d\ntetsugaku). Philosopher of Buddhist thought, Tamaki\nK\u014dshir\u014d discusses the significance of K\u016bkai\u2019s\nphilosophy within the history of Japanese Buddhism in his Nihon\nbukky\u014d shis\u014d ron. And philosopher of religion and\nreligious studies scholar Nakazawa Shin\u2019ichi, like Ueda, focuses\non K\u016bkai\u2019s mandalic philosophy in his book, Seppen\nkyokusenron. He reads K\u016bkai\u2019s works on Shingon as\ninvolving a hydrodynamic mode of thinking that in its flexibility\ndeals with the non-Euclidean currents of nature with its forces of\nreality, undulating in ripples and forming vortexes. He views the\nShingon mandala as approximating, with its circles and lines, what is\nexpressed in today\u2019s fractal geometry, whereby the\ninfinitesimally microcosmic part endlessly and indefinitely iterates\nthe patterns of the whole of nature in its innumerable vortexes and\ncurves.\n\nK\u016bkai\u2019s ideas engender an holistic view towards nature and\nthe cosmos as encompassing ourselves and in our interrelationships\nwith others. They may be of relevance to the dilemmas we face today in\nthis epoch of globalization, religious wars, technological\n\u201cenframing\u201d (to use Heidegger\u2019s terminology), and\nenvironmental hazards. And in terms of scholarship, as can be seen in\nsome of the above-mentioned Japanese scholars\u2019 works on\nK\u016bka, K\u016bkai offers a wealth of ideas for comparative\nanalyses: e.g. with Derrida on the world as text, with Process thought\non \u201ccosmo-holism,\u201d with Merleau-Ponty or Deleuze on the\nsignificance of the body and bodily spatiality and interrelationality\nvis-\u00e0-vis the environment, with Nishida or Hegel on dialectics\nand interrelationality, or with major \u201cmystic\u201d thinkers of\nother religious traditions such as Ibn Arabi of Islam or Meister\nEckhart of Christianity on a dynamic non-duality as opposed to both\nstatic monism and subject-object dualism. K\u016bkai\u2019s thinking\nprovides a wealth of insights, of much value, to offer to philosophers\nof today. ",
