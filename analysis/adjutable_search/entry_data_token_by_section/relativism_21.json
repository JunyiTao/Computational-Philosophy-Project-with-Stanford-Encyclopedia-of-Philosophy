    "main_text": "New Relativism || Truth Relativism and predicates of personal taste\n5.2 Truth Relativism and predicates of personal taste\nOne area of discourse that has been particularly fertile ground for New Relativism is discourse that concerns predicates of personal taste (e.g., \u201ctasty\u201d and \u201cfun\u201d.)\n5.2.1 Lasersohn (2005) and the judge parameter\nTake a case where Mary says: \u201cThe chili is tasty\u201d and John says, \u201cThe chili is not tasty\u201d. Lasersohn argues (much as K\u00f6lbel does) that only the truth-relativist can make sense of the nature of John and Mary\u2019s disagreement: It is a genuine disagreement. One affirms what the other denies. And yet neither is wrong. Lasersohn argues that there is an elegant way to make sense of the idea that John and Mary are both (in some sense) right, even though John asserts the negation of what is expressed by Mary. What Lasersohn) suggests, more formally, is the introduction of a judge parameter.\n\nInstead of treating the content of a sentence as a set of time-world pairs, we should treat it as a set of time-world-individual triples. We assume that the content will provide an individual to be used in evaluating the sentences for truth and falsity, just as it provides a time and world. (Lasersohn: 2005: 17)\n\nLasersohn adds (2005: 23) that in order to maintain an authentically subjective assignment of truth-values to sentences containing predicates of personal taste, we must allow that the objective facts of the situation of utterance do not uniquely determine a judge. But who is the judge? Typically, it is us, and when it is, the evaluation is from what Lasersohn calls an autocentric perspective. Importantly, Lasersohn allows that in certain circumstances we take an exocentric perspective when assessing predicates of personal taste: assessing these sentences for truth relative to contexts in which someone other than ourselves is specified as the judge (cf. \u201cCome on, it\u2019ll be fun!\u201d \u201cIs this fun?\u201d (2005: 26); cf. Stanley (2005: 10) for a response to Lasersohn\u2019s program).\n5.2.2 K\u00f6lbel and Faultless Disagreement\nK\u00f6lbel\u2019s (2003) faultless disagreement argument for relativism about predicates of personal taste features a \u201cproof\u201d that there is no faultless disagreement followed by a demonstration that the proof is indefensible. The proof proceeds from two premises: an equivalence schema\n\n(ES)\nIt is true that p iff p;\n\nand an apparent truism about mistakes:\n\n(T)\nIt is a mistake to believe a proposition that is not true.\n\n(ES) and (T) generate the conclusion that there is no faultless disagreement through the following proof (see also Wright 2001:52)\n\n(1)\nA believes that p. (Assumption)\n(2)\nB believes that not-p (Assumption)\n(3)\np (Assumption)\n(4)\nnot-true (not-p) 3, ES\n(5)\nB has made a mistake 2, 4, T\n(6)\nNot-p (Assumption)\n(7)\nNot-true (p) 6, ES\n(8)\nA has made a mistake (1, 6, T)\n(9)\nEither A or B has made a mistake (3\u20138)\n\nBut because K\u00f6lbel takes (9) to be implausible in what K\u00f6lbel takes to be \u201cdiscretionary\u201d (non-objective, as K\u00f6lbel sees it) areas of discourse he contends that we should introduce a relativized version of (T) to avoid the conclusion that at least one party has made a mistake.\n\n(T***)\nIt is a mistake to believe a discretionary proposition that is not true as evaluated from one\u2019s own perspective. (2003: 70)\n\nK\u00f6lbel claims further that, for reasons of uniformity, we should \u201crelativize truth of all propositions across the board\u2026\u201d and he accordingly endorses the following version of truth relativism:\n\n(TR)\nIt is a mistake to believe a proposition that is not true in one\u2019s own perspective. (2003: 70).\n\nK\u00f6lbel (2003: 71) thinks that this position allows the possibility of maintaining that faultless disagreement is impossible in some non-discretionary (objective) areas, and this will depend on the relation of perspective possession (but see also Boghossian 2011 for the contrary view). An implication of the position is that K\u00f6lbel\u2019s view will allow assertions of the form: \u201cPretzels are not tasty, though John believes they are. And yet John is not mistaken\u201d. For other discussions of faultless disagreement, see Richard (2008), MacFarlane (2012, 2014: ch. 6), and Zeman (2019). For an attempt to countenance faultless disagreement within an absolutist framework, see Baker & Robson (2017).\n5.2.3 Moral relativism\nThere is a version of moral relativism (e.g., K\u00f6lbel 2004) that falls squarely within the New Relativist tradition. We can think of this relativism simply as a generalization of the position just discussed that treats moral terms (e.g., \u201cright\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d) as assessment-sensitive along with predicates of personal taste.\nSuch an extension faces problems analogous to those faced by truth-relativists about predicates of personal taste (cf. Beebe (2010) for a helpful discussion of truth-relativist semantics versus varieties of contextualist competitors).\nA broader kind of problem for this semantic thesis (as well as to moral relativists more generally), raised by Coliva and Moruzzi (2012) is that it succumbs to the progress argument, an argument that famously challenges, in particular, cultural relativists (as well as indexical contextualists) about moral judgments by insisting that moral progress is both evident and not something the relativist can countenance (e.g., Rachels 2009). A third and particularly important kind of worry, addressed by Capps, Lynch and Massey (2009), involves explaining the source and nature of moral relativity, on a truth-relativist framework. Specifically, they claim that\n\nwe ought to have some account of why it is that truth in the moral domain is such that it varies with a parameter set by the context of assessment. (Capps, Lynch & Massey 2009: 416)\n\nAn additional problem concerns the plausibility of simply extending disagreement based arguments for relativism about predicates of personal taste over to moral predicates like \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018good\u2019. As Wedgwood (2019) has suggested, moral disagreements, in a way that is disanalogous to disagreements about what\u2019s tasty, implicate a kind of \u2018inexcusable irrationality\u2019 (2019: 97)\u2014at least, if the moral truths that constitute moral principles are a priori knowable. To the extent that there is a difference in inexcusability across the two cases of disagreement, it would be contentious to think that an argument from \u2018faultless disagreement\u2019 to relativism in the arena of predicates of personal taste would extend, mutatis mutandis, to an analogous argument in the moral arena.\n5.3 Truth relativism and epistemic modals\nEpistemic modality (e.g., claims of the form \u201cS might be F\u201d) is another particularly fertile ground for New Relativists. A key reason for this is the dialectical force of Eavesdropper Arguments, which attempt to show the perils of contextualist treatments of utterances containing epistemic modals. Another prominent argument concerns metasemantic complexity. We will examine both of these argument strategies. But first, let\u2019s distinguish epistemic modality from metaphysical modality. To say that p is metaphysically possible is to say that p might have been the case in the sense that: in some possible world, p is true. To say that p is epistemically possible is by contrast to say that p might be the case, or that p is the case for all we know (see the entry on Varieties of Modality). A canonical example of a statement expressing an epistemic modal is the claim A might be F. The truth of claims of the form A might be F will depend on whether F is an epistemic possibility for some individual or group, which is to say, that F must not be ruled out by what some individual or group knows. But which individual or group? This is not always clear. As Egan and Weatherson (2011: 4) remark:\n\n\u2026statements of epistemic possibility in plain English do not make any explicit reference to such a person, group, evidence set, or information state. One of the key issues confronting a semanticist attempting to theorize about epistemic modals is what to do about this lack of reference.\n\nEavesdropper-style cases highlight the difficulty of determining exactly which individual\u2019s or group\u2019s body of information is relevant to the truth of claims of epistemic possibility and are taken by defenders of truth-relativism about epistemic modals to motivate their position. A variety of different eavesdropper cases have been given by different proponents (and attempted refuters) of truth-relativism about epistemic modals in the literature. For ease of exposition, we will use an especially simple version of the case, from Hawthorne\u2019s (2007), slightly amended:\n\nEAVESDROPPER: [Sandra] is on the way to the grocery store. I hear her say: \u201cSusan might be at the store. I could run into her\u201d. No party to the conversation that I am listening in on knows that Susan is on vacation. But I know that she is. Despite the fact that it is compatible with what the conversants know that Susan is in the store and that the speaker will run into her, I am inclined to judge the speaker\u2019s [Sandra\u2019s] modal judgments to be incorrect. (Hawthorne 2007: 92)\n\nEgan (2007), Egan, Hawthorne and Weatherson (2005) and MacFarlane (2011b) share a similar set of diagnoses here: (i) it seems that while Sandra and I disagree about the truth value of Sandra\u2019s statement, neither she nor I have made a mistake; (ii) the contextualist can\u2019t explain this; (iii) the truth-relativist can.\nWhy can\u2019t the contextualist explain this? As noted, the truth of claims expressing epistemic modals must depend on what some individual or group knows. But in these cases the context of use does not pick out a single such individual or group. After all, if it did, then either Sandra or I would be wrong, but it seems that neither of us is. That the context of use does not uniquely pick out one relevant body of knowledge for determining the truth of epistemic modal statements is not, as MacFarlane notes, something that can be accommodated by \u201cthe framework of contextualism, which requires that the relevant body of knowledge be determined by features of the context of use\u201d. (MacFarlane 2011c)\nAdditionally, as Egan and Weatherson (2011) suggest, any contextualist account of the semantics of epistemic modals that could handle eavesdropper-style cases in a principled way would be hideously complicated. This motivates a metasemantic argument against contextualism (and a corresponding argument for relativism): if contextualism about epistemic modals is correct, then the semantics for epistemic modals will be hideously complicated; the semantics is not hideously complicated on the truth-relativist\u2019s proposal, therefore, ceteris paribus, truth-relativism for epistemic modals is more plausible than contextualism. However, Glanzberg (2007) notably denies that metasemantic complexity in this case must be problematic.\nHow can the relativist accommodate eavesdropper cases? MacFarlane (2011b) articulates the relativist solution: Sandra and I disagree about the truth-value of a single proposition, the proposition that Susan might be at the store. This proposition, even when fully articulated, makes no reference to any particular body of knowledge. But such propositions cannot be true or false simpliciter. They are true only relative to a context of assessment that includes a body of knowledge. In this case, the proposition is true relative to a context of assessment where what Sandra knows is operative\u2014a context in which Sandra is the evaluator\u2014and false relative to a context of assessment where what I know is operative because I am the evaluator. Thus: both disagreement and faultlessness are preserved (cf. Ross & Schroeder 2013 for criticism and Kindermann & Egan (2019) for an alternative proposal).\nAlong with MacFarlane, Egan (2007) and Stephenson (2007) have also offered positive defenses of truth-relativism about epistemic modals; their defenses share MacFarlane\u2019s view that propositions expressing epistemic modals are non-specific along dimensions that include the body of information possessed by a judge or assessor.\nMore recently, experimental philosophy has contributed to this debate. Empirical studies reported by Knobe & Yalcin (2014) and Khoo (2015) indicate that folk judgments about the truth of claims featuring epistemic modals aligns more closely with what contextualism rather than relativism would predict. However, see Beddor and Egan (2019) for experimental results that are argued to better support (a version of) relativism than contextualism.\n5.4 Truth relativism and future contingents\nPropositions termed \u201cfuture contingents\u201d are about the future and their truth-values are not settled by the state of the world in the past or present (see entry on Future Contingents, and MacFarlane 2014: ch. 9). In a deterministic world there are no future contingent statements in this sense. But in an indeterministic world, statements partly about the future will often satisfy these conditions. Consider Aristotle\u2019s oft-cited example: the proposition There will be a sea battle tomorrow, uttered at t. Contrast now two intuitions: the determinacy intuition that utterances that \u201cturned out true\u201d were true at the time of utterance; and the indeterminacy intuition that, at the time of the utterance, multiple histories are possible, including one where there was a sea battle and the proposition is true, and one where there was not, and the proposition is false. The indeterminacy intuition leads us to think the truth-value of future contingents is indeterminate at the time of utterance, and either true or false at a later time (cf. MacFarlane 2003; Carter 2011).\nJohn MacFarlane (2003) thinks that both the indeterminacy intuition and the determinacy intuition should be taken at face value and that the only way to account for the semantics of future contingents is to allow the truth of future contingent statements to be, as he puts it, doubly relativized: to both the context of utterance and the context of assessment. When we evaluate a single token utterance of \u201cThere will be a sea battle tomorrow\u201d produced on (say) Monday, this counts as neither true nor false when the context of assessment is the context in which the utterance is being made (as multiple possible histories are open at this point). However the very same statement will have a determinate truth-value relative to the context of assessment of the following day. So we can have faultless transtemporal disagreement about the truth-value of a single utterance (MacFarlane 2003: 36; cf. Carter 2011).\n5.5 Truth relativism and knowledge ascriptions\nMacFarlane (2005b) argues that \u201cknow\u201d is sensitive to the epistemic standards at play in the context of assessment; that is, the extension of \u201cknow\u201d varies with the context of assessment. Much as the relativist about future contingents aimed to accommodate both the determinacy and indeterminacy intuitions, the relativist about knowledge attributions can be viewed as offering an attempted synthesis between the contextualist and both sensitive and insensitive varieties of invariantist (see entry on Epistemic Contextualism). As MacFarlane (2014: 190) puts it:\n\nInvariantism is right that there is a single knowledge relation, and that the accuracy of knowledge ascriptions does not depend on which epistemic standard is relevant at the context of use. But contextualism is right that the accuracy of such ascriptions depends somehow on contextually relevant standards. Relativism seeks to synthesize these insights into a more satisfactory picture.\n\nTo apply this view, suppose George says, \u201cBill knows that his car is in the driveway\u201d, while Barry says, \u201cBill doesn\u2019t know that his car is in the driveway\u201d. According to the relativist, the assessment of the truth-values of Bill\u2019s and Barry\u2019s statements depends also on the specification of some epistemic standard. For the truth-relativist, the standard will be the operative standard in the context of assessment. George\u2019s utterance may be true (and Barry\u2019s false) relative to a context of assessment in which ordinary \u201clow\u201d standards are in place, whereas Barry\u2019s may be true (and George\u2019s false) relative to a context of assessment in which high \u201cCartesian\u201d standards are in place. See Stanley (2005: ch. 7) for a detailed criticism of this position, though see also MacFarlane (2014: \u00a78.5 for a reply). See also Richard (2004), for another version of truth-relativism for knowledge attributions. In MacFarlane\u2019s more recent (2014) defense of a truth-relativist semantics for \u201cknows\u201d, the context of assessment is taken to fix which alternatives count as relevant. See, however, Carter 2015 for an argument that MacFarlane\u2019s more recent view generates counterintuitive results in cases of environmental epistemic luck (e.g., barn fa\u00e7ade-style cases) and normative defeaters.\n5.6 General Objections to New Relativism\nWe turn now to two general arguments against New Relativism in all its forms. The first is an argument from assertion, the second an argument from simplicity.\n5.6.1 Relativism and assertion\nTwo assertion-related objections to New Relativism arise from work by Gareth Evans (1985) and Robert Stalnaker (1978), respectively. Greenough (2010: 2) concisely captures Evans\u2019s challenge to truth-relativism on assertoric grounds as follows:\n\n(1)\nThe question \u201cWhat should [an assertor] aim at?\u201d is a legitimate question.\n(2)\nAny legitimate answer to this question will generate a once-and-for-all answer.\n(3)\nAny once-and-for-all answer is incompatible with Truth-Relativism\n(4)\nTherefore, Truth Relativism is ruled out.\n\nThe relativist must plausibly take issue with (2) or (3), (or both). For an attempt to meet Evans\u2019 challenge, MacFarlane has defended a way to effectively reject (2) via what Marques has called a \u201cmeet-the-challenge\u201d norm of assertion (cf. MacFarlane 2003; though see also his 2014: ch. 5; cf., Stanley 2016: 181\u20132)\u2014according to which (\u00e0 la Brandom 1983), in asserting p one undertakes a commitment to either defending p or giving up p if the challenge cannot be met satisfactorily (see K\u00f6lbel (2004: 308) for some other discussions of this objection).\nA related assertion-based challenge to truth-relativism emerges by appeal to Stalnaker\u2019s (1978) belief transfer model of assertion (cf. 2011). The idea here is to appeal to a plausible view of the purpose of assertion\u2014to \u201ctransfer beliefs from assertor to members of her audience\u201d (Egan 2007: 15) and then to object that what is asserted, according to the truth-relativist, cannot play this characteristic role; specifically, this will be because, for the truth-relativist, the asserted contents are liable to be true relative to the speaker but false relative to the audience. For instance, Sam hardly (on the truth-relativist\u2019s program) seems to \u201ctransfer\u201d to Dean his belief Apples are tasty (which is true) by asserting this to Dean, when what Dean comes to believe Apples are tasty is something (on the assumption that Dean doesn\u2019t like apples) that will be false. Thus, and more generally, it\u2019s not clear what, exactly, could be said to be transferred and a fortiori asserted. See Egan (2007) and Dinges (2017) for attempts to reconcile truth-relativism (about epistemic modals) with Stalnaker\u2019s belief-transfer model of assertion.\n5.6.2 Simplicity\nCappelen and Hawthorne (2009) assess the merits of New Relativism as it stands to challenge what they take to be the received view of the objects of thought and talk, \u201cSimplicity\u201d, the core tenets of which are:\n\n(T1)\nThere are propositions and they instantiate the fundamental monadic properties of truth simpliciter and falsity simpliciter.\n(T2)\nThe semantic values of declarative sentences relative to contexts of utterance are propositions.\n(T3)\nPropositions are, unsurprisingly, the objects of propositional attitudes, such as belief, hope, wish, doubt.\n(T4)\nPropositions are the objects of illocutionary acts; they are, e.g., what we assert and deny.\n(T5)\nPropositions are the objects of agreement and disagreement. (Cappelen & Hawthorne 2009: 1)\n\nCappelen and Hawthorne understand New Relativism (what they call analytic relativism) as a direct challenge to (T1) and that, if this challenge were successful, it would consequently bring down the more general picture they call \u201csimplicity\u201d (cf., Ferrari & Wright 2017). Accordingly, Cappelen and Hawthorne\u2019s central objective is to show that truth-relativist\u2019s arguments aimed at undermining (T1) are ultimately unsuccessful; more specifically, their broad strategy is to insist that the arguments adduced in favor of truth-relativism\u2014when thoroughly understood\u2014constitute a presumptive case for contextualism (in the domains where relativism was defended, and in particular, in the domain of predicates of personal taste).\n6. Conclusion\nRelativism comes in a plethora of forms that are themselves grounded in disparate philosophical motivations. There is no such thing as Relativism simpliciter, and no single argument that would establish or refute every relativistic position that has been proposed. Despite this diversity, however, there are commonalities and family resemblances that justify the use of the label \u201crelativism\u201d for the various views we have discussed. Relativism remains a hotly disputed topic still surviving various attempts to eliminate it from philosophical discourse. What is most surprising, however, is the recent popularity of some versions of the doctrine in at least some circles of analytic philosophy.",
