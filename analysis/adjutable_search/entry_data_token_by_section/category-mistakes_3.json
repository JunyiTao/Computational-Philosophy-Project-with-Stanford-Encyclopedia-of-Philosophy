    "main_text": "Accounts of the Infelicity of Category Mistakes || Semantic Approaches\n3.2 Semantic Approaches\n\n\nA second way of accounting for the infelicity of category mistakes is\nto maintain that they are syntactically well-formed but semantically\ndefective. This general approach encompasses several different views.\nTo see why, note that there are various kinds of semantic values that\nare assigned to a single sentence token. First, a sentence is assigned\na general meaning. Without going into too much theory, we can\nthink of the meaning of a sentence as the result of combining the\ndefinitions of each of the words it contains, and also as what the\nsentence shares with its translations into other languages. Thus the\nmeaning of the English sentence \u2018I am tall\u2019 is a property\nit shares with the French sentence \u2018Je suis grande\u2019.\nSecond, when a sentence is uttered in a particular context, it\nexpresses a particular content. For example, in a context\nwhere Sophie utters the sentence \u2018I am tall\u2019 it expresses\nthe proposition that Sophie is tall, and in a context where Jim utters\nthis sentence it expresses the proposition that Jim is tall. Third,\nparticular tokens of the sentence receive\na truth-value\u2014for example, when Sophie utters \u2018I\nam tall\u2019, her (token) sentence is true if she is indeed tall,\nand false otherwise.\n\n\nCorresponding to these three kinds of semantic values are three\ndifferent semantic accounts of category mistakes: according to the\nfirst (\u2018the meaninglessness view\u2019), category mistakes are\nsyntactically well-formed but meaningless; according to the second\n(\u2018the contentlessness view\u2019) they are meaningful but lack\ncontent; according to the third (\u2018the truthvaluelessness\nview\u2019), they are meaningful and have a content, but lack a\ntruth-value (or at least lack one of the two standard truth-values,\ntrue and false).\n3.2.1 The Meaninglessness View\n\n\nThe meaninglessness view has been the most popular account of category\nmistakes throughout the history of the debate, and still receives\nconsiderable support from both linguists and philosophers. For\nexample, Beall and van Fraassen (2003, 125) say that \u201cthere are\ndifferent ways in which a (declarative) sentence might properly be\ncalled \u2018meaningless\u2019. Perhaps the best example involves\nso-called category mistakes\u201d and Sauerland and von\nStechow (2001, 15413) describe sentences such as Chomsky\u2019s\nfamous \u2018Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\u2019 as ones\n which \u201care syntactically well formed but do not make any\n sense\u201d.[13]\n\n\nThe meaninglessness view is highly intuitive: category mistakes are\nextremely infelicitous and often generate the feeling that they simply\ndo not make any sense. Another advantage of the meaninglessness view is\nthat it arguably has the best chance of providing a clean answer to the\nquestion of how to characterize category mistakes (cf. \u00a71). This\nis so because if category mistakes are grammatical but meaningless,\nthen plausibly, they also constitute the only kind of sentence\nthat have these two features. By contrast, the same does not seem to be\ntrue of any of the other accounts discussed: for example, even if\ncategory mistakes are syntactically ill-formed (\u00a73.1) or suffer\nfrom presupposition failures (\u00a73.4) they are clearly not the only\nkind of strings to have these features. The meaninglessness view might\nalso be motivated by a commitment to a particular favored theory of\nmeaning. For example, a proponent of conceptual role semantics might\nmaintain that category mistakes play no conceptual role, and thus are\n predicted by the theory to be\n meaningless.[14]\n\n\nHowever, the meaninglessness view also faces several serious\nchallenges. First, note that some of the observations raised against\nthe syntactic approach (\u00a73.1) also pose a problem for the\nmeaninglessness view. For example, consider the context sensitivity of\ncategory mistakes. Since in some contexts \u2018The thing I am\nthinking about is green\u2019 is entirely innocuous the sentence is\nclearly meaningful. But as with being syntactically well-formed, being\nmeaningful is a context invariant property of a sentence so the\nsentence must be meaningful even in those contexts where the thing I\nam thinking of is the number two.\n\n\nSimilarly, the fact that category mistakes embed felicitously in\npropositional attitude reports presents at least a challenge to the\nmeaninglessness view: since \u2018John said that the number two is\ngreen\u2019, or \u2018Jane dreamt that her toothbrush is\npregnant\u2019 are themselves felicitous reports, these reports are\nnot (even by the lights of the meaninglessness view) meaningless. This\nleaves the question of whether it is possible that the report as a\nwhole is meaningful, even though the embedded category mistake is not.\nNote that in the case of the syntactic approach, we were able to test\nhow such embeddings behave using clear examples of syntactically\nill-formed strings, ones which are not themselves category mistakes\n(e.g. \u2018John said that rides boy the on\u2019). In this case,\nhowever, matters are much trickier as we do not have any clear examples\nof grammatical but meaningless sentences that are not category mistakes\nwhich we can use to test the behavior of such embeddings. Nevertheless,\nmore theoretical arguments concerning the semantics of attitude reports\nmight bear on the question. For example, if we accept that the meaning\nof a sentence is composed out of the meaning of its constituents and\nthat the relevant \u2018that\u2019-clause is a constituent of the\n attitude\n report,[15]\n it follows that the attitude report as a whole cannot be meaningful \nif its constituent category mistake is meaningless.\n\n\nConsiderations of compositionality (the principle that the meaning of\na sentence is composed of the meaning of its parts), can also be\nbrought to bear more directly on the question of whether category\nmistakes are meaningful. One might be tempted to think that the mere\nfact that a category mistake such as \u2018Two is green\u2019 is\ncomposed out of meaningful words arranged in a grammatical way is\nsufficient to trivially entail, given compositionality, that the\nsentence is meaningful. This temptation ought to be resisted, though:\nfor all we have said, the principle of compositionality merely shows\nthat when a sentence has a meaning then that meaning is\ncomposed out of the meaning of its parts. This is not the same as\nsaying that any (grammatical) combination of meaningful parts always\n successfully results in a sentence\n meaning.[16]\n It is thus open to defenders of the meaninglessness view to accept\nthat meaning is compositional, but deny that category mistakes are\nmeaningful.\n\n\nNevertheless, considerations of compositionality might still pose a\nsignificant challenge to the meaninglessness view. This is so because\ndefenders of the meaninglessness view need to provide a compositional\nsemantic theory that accounts for the meaning of those sentences that\nthey do deem to be meaningful. The problem is that once such a\ntheory provides a systematic recipe for how to assign meanings to\nbenign sentences, there is a risk that an assignment of meanings to\ncategorically mistaken combinations will automatically fall out. To\nillustrate the point, suppose that the semantic theory assigns objects\nto the names \u2018Two\u2019 and \u2018Desky\u2019 (the number two\nand a particular desk respectively), and the ordinary functions from\nobjects to truth-values to the predicates \u2018is green\u2019 and\n\u2018is prime\u2019. Suppose further that the recursive\nspecification of the theory say that the meaning of any sentence of the\nform \u2018\\(a\\) is \\(P\\)\u2019 is the claim that\n\\(f(o)=\\)true, where \\(f\\) is the function denoted by\n\u2018\\(P\\)\u2019 and \\(o\\) is the object denoted by\n\u2018\\(a\\)\u2019. Note that even if this theory was only\ndesigned to account for the meaning of standard combinations such as\n\u2018Desky is green\u2019 and \u2018Two is prime\u2019, it also\ninadvertently assigns a meaning to the category mistakes \u2018Two is\ngreen\u2019 and \u2018Desky is prime\u2019. Of course, one can try\nto amend the semantic theory so that it avoids this consequence, but\nthe question is whether a semantic theory can be constructed that\nsucceeds in assigning meanings to precisely all and only\nnon-categorically mistaken sentences.\n\n\nA completely different set of challenges to the meaninglessness view\nstems from the fact that while category mistakes are rarely used in\nliteral discourse, they are highly prevalent in figurative speech.\nConsider for example a metaphorical use of \u2018The poem is\npregnant\u2019 (by a critic, wanting to describe the richness of the\npoem); a metonymic use of \u2018The ham sandwich left without\npaying\u2019 (uttered by a waiter in reference the customer who\nordered the ham sandwich); or uses of category mistakes in fiction (a\nstory containing the sentence \u2018The tree forgave the boy\u2019\nor even \u2018The number two was happy\u2019). Indeed, the very fact\nthat the sentences in question are category mistakes often serves as\n in indication that the sentence is used figuratively rather than\n literally.[17]\n\n\nThe very fact that category mistakes have such figurative uses is\nnot in itself a problem for the meaninglessness view: prima facie,\nthere is no contradiction between the claims that, when taken\nliterally, category mistakes are meaningless while when used\nfiguratively, they can be meaningful. However, figurative uses of\nspeech clearly have some connection to their literal meanings,\nwith different theories offering different accounts of this connection.\nThe question then becomes, for each such account of figurative uses,\nwhether it requires the relevant sentence to also be literally\nmeaningful.\n\n\nConsider the case of metaphor. According to one central view of\nmetaphor, the metaphorical meaning of a sentence is communicated via the\nmechanism of conversational implicature: when one utters a metaphor,\nthe proposition literally expressed by the metaphor blatantly violates\none of Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation (typically the maxims of\nquality or relevance) thus giving rise to an implicated content which\nconstitutes the metaphorical meaning. There is more to say about the\ndetails of the view, but the crucial point for our purposes is that on\nthe Gricean account of metaphor, metaphorical meanings are generated\nindirectly, using the literal content of the sentence. But then in\norder for a sentence to receive a metaphorical interpretation, it must\nalso have a literal meaning, and in particular successful metaphors\nthat are category mistakes are also literally meaningful, pace\nthe meaninglessness view.\n\n\nA better hope for the meaninglessness view are accounts of metaphor\non which the metaphorical meaning does not depend on the literal\nmeaning of the entire metaphorical sentence, but merely on the meaning\nof some sub-sentential phrases. For example according to Joseph\nStern\u2019s account (Stern 2000), when a sentence is used\nmetaphorically, some of its sub-sentential phrases are embedded under a\nspecial operator called \u2018Mthat\u2019, which delivers as an\noutput a new (contextually determined) metaphorical meaning for that\nphrase. Thus on Stern\u2019s view, when used metaphorically the\nsentence \u2018The poem is pregnant\u2019 has the deeper structure\n\u2018The poem is Mthat(pregnant)\u2019, where\n\u2018Mthat(pregnant)\u2019 can be interpreted in context as, for\nexample, the property of containing many ideas. When we consider such\nsyntactically simple metaphors, Stern\u2019s view seems entirely\nconsistent with the meaninglessness view: at no stage in this\ninterpretation are we required to assign a (literal) meaning to the\nentire categorically mistaken sentence. However, things become more\ndifficult once we consider metaphors with a more complex structure.\nThus consider the following conversation, discussing Jane\u2019s\nresearch:\n\nJill:\nSo, I heard that Jane ended up giving up her\n    idea for the thesis?\nSally:\nOh, she didn't just give it up. She dropkicked\n    the idea noisily off the nearest cliff!\n\n\n\nSally\u2019s second sentence \u2018She dropkicked the idea noisily\noff the cliff\u2019 is a metaphor, so on Stern\u2019s view, some\nsyntactic phrase within that sentence should be read as falling within\nthe scope of an \u2018Mthat\u2019 operator. Magidor (2017, 70) argues\nthat Mthat must apply here to the entire verb phase (\u2018dropkicked\nthe idea nosily off the nearest cliff\u2019). But note that Stern\nrequires Mthat to apply to meaningful\n phrases,[18]\nso the entire verb phrase needs to be meaningful.\nInterestingly, however, once one has conceded that the verb phrase is\nliterally meaningful, there is no reason not to take the entire\nsentence to be meaningful as well: the introduction of the subject term\nis entirely innocuous, and if there were any problem arising from\ncategory mistakes being meaningless it should have already arisen at\n the stage where one talks of an idea being dropkicked off a\n cliff.[19]\n\n\nAnother more general problem for reconciling the meaninglessness view\nwith an account of metaphor is raised by Camp (2004, 225). Camp points\nout that not all metaphors are category mistakes, and indeed some are\nobviously literally meaningful and even true. (Consider for example a\nmetaphorical use of \u2018Anchorage is a cold city\u2019.)  This\nposits a dilemma for the meaninglessness view. Either even in such\ncases, the metaphorical meaning is accounted for without making use of\nthe literal meaning of the sentence in which case the account deprives\nitself of some helpful resources in interpreting the metaphor. Or\nelse, the account of metaphor becomes bifurcated\u2014offering one\naccount for metaphors that are also category mistakes and another one\nfor those that are not.\n3.2.2 The Contentlessness View\n\n\nAccording to the contentlessness view, category mistakes are\nmeaningful but fail to express a proposition. An attractive feature of\nthe contentlessness view is that it addresses one of the most pressing\nobjections against the previous two accounts: namely, accommodating the\ncontext sensitivity of category mistakes. Unlike grammaticality and\nmeaningfulness, what content (if any) is assigned to a sentence is not\na context-invariant property. So one can coherently maintain that\n\u2018This is green\u2019 is perfectly acceptable in contexts where\nthe demonstrative refers to a pen, while lacking content in contexts\nwhere the demonstrative refers to the number two.\n\n\nThe contentlessness view can be developed in two rather different\nways. The first way to develop the view is particularly attractive to\nthose who accept some kind of radical contextualism about natural\nlanguage: the view that every (or nearly every) expression of natural\nlanguage is context sensitive. Suppose one accepted, for example, that\nthe content of the predicate \u2018is green\u2019 is extremely\nsensitive to context (dimensions of sensitivity might include which set\nof shades are being picked by the predicate or which parts of the\nobject need to exhibit the color in order to satisfy it). One might\nthen maintain that in the case of category mistakes such as \u2018Two\nis green\u2019, the sentence is so artificial that there simply\nisn\u2019t enough material in the context to determine which property\n\u2018is green\u2019 denotes, and hence some words in the sentence\n (and ipso facto the sentence as a whole) cannot be assigned a\n content.[20]\n A second, very different way to develop the view assumes that in\ncategory mistakes such as \u2018Two is green\u2019, each word\nsucceeds in picking out a content but these contents fail to compose\ntogether to form a unified proposition.\n\n\nA way to put pressure on the contentlessness view on either of its\nversions is by constructing examples of apparent category mistakes (or\ncategory mistake-like utterances) that are designed specifically to\nensure there should be a content in place. With respect to the first,\ncontextualist proposal we can consider the following sequence, uttered\nin a particular context:\n\n(14)\nThis pen is green. So is the number two.\n\n\n\nThe first sentence in the sequence uses \u2018is green\u2019 in a\nperfectly ordinary context so it is assigned a content in the usual\nmanner (a particular color property). This property is then\nanaphorically referred to in the second sentence. This ensures that\nthe second sentence in the sequence doesn\u2019t suffer from the kind\nof content failure due to insufficient contextual information, despite\nattempting to attribute a color to the number two.\n\n\nOf course (14) does not pose any problems for the second version of\nthe contentlessness view, which locates the problem with category\nmistakes in the composition of contents (presumably, according this\nversion, the number wouldn\u2019t be able to compose with the color\nproperty referred to anaphorically). However, consider an utterance of\nthe following sentence, in a context where the thing I am thinking\nabout is a table (and where the description is interpreted as\nnon-rigid):\n\n(15)\nThe thing I am thinking about is green.\n\n\n\nAs uttered in this context the sentence is entirely innocuous, and\nhence clearly expresses a proposition (call this proposition\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019). The problem, however, arises when we evaluate\n\\(p\\) relative to a possible world \\(w\\) in which the thing I am\nthinking about is the number two. (Crucially, note that we are\nevaluating the very same proposition \\(p\\), not the proposition that\nwould have been expressed by (15) had it been uttered in\n\\(w\\)). Relative to \\(w\\), \\(p\\) is a proposition which effectively\nascribes to the number two the property of being green. The example\ndoes not quite provide us with an example of a contentful category\nmistake (arguably, since (15) is actually uttered in the innocuous\ncontext, it is not itself a category mistake), but it does suggest\nthat some propositions succeed in ascribing colour properties to\nnumbers, and hence this kind of predication shouldn\u2019t in general\nbe an obstacle to generating contents.\n\n\nIn addition to these worries, note that while the contentlessness view\nis well-equipped to address some of the objections against the\nmeaninglessness view (such as the context sensitivity objection), it\nnevertheless shares some of the problems that the meaninglessness view\nfaces. For example, successful embeddings under propositional attitude\nreports present a challenge for the contentlessness view if one\nmaintains that the report as a whole is contentful, and that the\ncontent of the embedded category mistake is a constituent of the\ncontent expressed by the report as a whole. And many views of the\nsemantics of figurative language conflict with the contentlessness\nview as well: for example, the Gricean view of metaphor discussed\nabove requires that category mistakes are not only meaningful but also\ncontentful.\n3.2.3 The Truthvaluelessness View\n\n\nThe third semantic account of category mistakes is one according to\nwhich category mistakes are meaningful, contentful, but lack a\ntruth-value (\u2018the truthvaluelessness view\u2019). This gets\naround many of the issues raised against previous semantic accounts.\nFor example, in the case of (14) or (15) defenders of the\ntruthvaluelessness view need not deny that there is a proposition\n\\(p\\) which predicates greenness to the number two. They can simply\nmaintain that in such cases the proposition is truth-valueless. The\ntruthvaluelessness view also seems to be better equipped to deal with\nthe embedding problem (there doesn\u2019t seem any obvious issue with\na contentful or even true report that embeds a truth-valueless\nsentence) or the problems to do with figurative language (even if the\nfigurative meaning depends on a literal meaning or content, it does\nnot seem to depend on any literal truth-values).\n\n\nShaw (2015) proposes another interesting argument in favor of the\n truthvaluelessness\n view.[21]\n Shaw maintains that there is a special mechanism for restricting the\ndomain of quantifiers so as to avoid categorically mistaken statements\nin their scope. Suppose for example that Bob\u2019s yard contains\nseveral planted trees and also a pile of wooden planks lying on the\nground. Now consider the contrast between the following two\nsentences:\n\n(16)\nBob uprooted everything in his yard and burned it.\n(17)\nBob burned everything in his yard.\n\n\n\nIn (16), we seem to be quantifying only over the trees in the yard,\nwhile in (17) we are quantifying over (at least) both the trees and\nthe planks. Shaw argues that this observation cannot be accounted for\nby typical mechanisms of contextual domain restriction, or by\npragmatic considerations such as providing a charitable\ninterpretation. Instead, he proposes, this kind of restriction can be\nexplained by the following two hypotheses: first, language users\nattempt to interpret statements so as to maximize truth-evaluability\n(namely, as having some truth value or other); second, category\nmistakes are truth-valueless. The thought is that if the quantifier\nin (16) is allowed to range over some of the planks, then the open\nsentence \u2018Bob uprooted \\(x\\)\u2019 will be a truth-valueless\ncategory mistake relative to assignments where the variable is\nassigned a plank and this will entail the universally quantified\nsentence as a whole is truth-valueless. In order to avoid this\nconsequence and maximize the truth-evaluability of the statement,\ninterpreters restrict the quantifier so as to range only over the\ntrees.\n\n\nShaw\u2019s argument, however, is not decisive. One issue is that the\nrestriction data is not entirely systematic, in the sense that other\nexamples with exactly the same structure seem to elicit different\nintuitions. For example, consider a context involving a long column of\nletters and numbers randomly mixed together. Suppose John multiplied\nall the numbers in the column by three. The following seems at best\nfalse, possibly infelicitous:\n\n(18)\nJohn multiplied everything written on the page\n    by three.\n\n\n\nNote that Shaw\u2019s analysis predicts that the quantifier in (18)\nwould be restricted to only the numbers on the page, and thus that the\nutterance should be felicitous and true. Second, even assuming that\nShaw is right that we do systematically restrict domains of\nquantification so to avoid categorically mistaken predications, it is\nnot clear that the claim that category mistakes are truth-valueless is\nessential for this mechanism of domain restriction. Consider any\ntheory that systematically tracks the status of category mistakes as\ninfelicitous (e.g., a presuppositional view, as discussed in\n\u00a73.4). On the face of it, one could equally well explain\nShaw\u2019s data using the alternative hypothesis that the\ncategorically mistaken status of sentences projects into quantified\nstatements in precisely the way that Shaw predicts, and that speakers\nhave a strategy of maximizing the\nfelicity (rather than truth-evaluability) of their\nutterances.\n\n\nThe truthvaluelessness view also faces some unique challenges. One\nsuch challenge arises from its commitment to the claim that there are\nsentences which express a proposition but are nevertheless\ntruth-valueless. Two widely accepted principles governing the notions\nof truth and falsity are Tarski\u2019s truth-schemas, which can be\nstated thus:\n\n(T)\nThe proposition that \\(p\\) is true if and only\n    if \\(p\\).\n(F)\nThe proposition that \\(p\\) is false if and only\n    if not \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nBut as Williamson (1994, 187\u2013198) argues, these principles are\ninconsistent with the claim that there is a truth-valueless\nproposition: For suppose that the proposition that \\(p\\) is neither\ntrue nor false. From (T), since it is not true that \\(p\\), then\nnot \\(p\\). From (F), since it is not false that \\(p\\), then not\nnot \\(p\\). We have now arrived at a direct contradiction:\nnot-\\(p\\) and not-not-\\(p\\).\n\n\nNote that this is an objection that neither of the previous two\nsemantic accounts of category mistakes face: the Tarskian truth schema\ndo not apply to cases where \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 does not express a\nproposition at all (either because it is meaningless or because it is\nmeaningful but contentless).\n\n\nOf course, a natural response for defenders of the\n truthvaluelessness view is to reject the Tarskian\n truth-schema.[22] \n Indeed, arguably, the semantic paradoxes such as the Liar already\nmotivate the rejection of the schema for reasons entirely independent\nof category mistakes. Against this, defenders of the schema have\nsuggested that the semantic paradoxes might be addressed in a way that\ndoes not require a commitment to truth-valueless propositions. One\npotential assessment of the dialectical situation is this: perhaps\naccounting for the infelicity of category mistakes is not on its own\nsufficient to ground a rejection of the truth schema, which is\noften thought to be fundamental to our concepts of truth and\nfalsity. However, if the schema ought to be rejected on independent\ngrounds, then applying the apparatus of truth-valueless propositions\nto the case of category mistakes looks attractive. If we accept this\nassessment, then the issue of whether one should accept the\ntruthvaluelessness view turns on the much wider issue of our response\nto the semantic paradoxes.\n\n\nAs noted at the outset of this subsection, one of the key advantages\nof the truthvaluelessness view over the previous two semantic views is\nthat it does not automatically deem any sentence in which a category\nmistake is embedded to be infelicitous. How does, then, the\ntruthvaluelessness view treat embeddings of category mistake in more\ncomplex sentences, and in particular those involving logical\nconnectives such as disjunction, conjunction, or conditionals?\n\n\nA range of logics have been developed for determining the truth-values\nof complex sentences in the presence of truth-value gaps. One option\nis to use Weak Kleene logic (WK), on which a complex sentence which\nhas a truth-valueless constituent will always be truth-valueless as\nwell. But assuming the truthvaluelessness view takes a sentence to be\ninfelicitous if and only if it is truth-valueless (at least where the\nlack of truth-value is due to the occurrence of some category\nmistake), this approach will over-predict infelicity. Consider for\nexample the following:\n\n(19)\nIf numbers have colors, then the number two is green.\n\n\n\nWhile the sentence is perhaps surprising, it seems significantly more\nfelicitous than typical category mistakes, but on the WK treatment it\nwill be deemed truth-valueless and hence predicted to be\ninfelicitous. Other problems occur when we consider how WK treats\nquantified sentences. Consider for example the following:\n\n(20)\nSomething is green.\n\n\n\nSuppose the domain contains several concrete objects (including some\ngreen ones), as well as some abstract objects. Intuitively, (20) is\nfelicitous and true (after all, there are some green objects in the\ndomain). However, according to the WK treatment of category mistakes\nthe sentence ought to be truth-valueless. This is so because the\nexistential quantifier scopes over the open formula \u2018\\(x\\) is\ngreen\u2019 which is truth-valueless relative to some assignments\n (e.g. ones where \\(x\\) is assigned a\n number).[23]\n\n\nBoth of these problems are avoided by using Strong Kleene logic (SK)\ninstead. According SK, a sentence with a truth-valueless constituent\nisn\u2019t automatically deemed truth-valueless. Specifically, a\nsentence of the form \u2018If \\(A\\) then \\(B\\)\u2019 (with the\nconditional interpreted as material) is true if \\(A\\) is false and\n\\(B\\) is truth-valueless, and an existentially quantified sentence is\ntrue if it has one true instance (even if some other instances are\ntruth-valueless), and thus neither (19) nor (20) would be deemed\ntruth-valueless. However, the SK treatment of category mistakes\npossibly errs in the other direction, namely by under-predicting\ninfelicity. Consider for example the following:\n\n(21)\n? Either the number two is green or the number\n    five is prime.\n(22)\n? The number two is green and Lisbon is the\n    capital of France.\n\n\n\nOn a SK treatment of category mistakes, the fact that (21) has one\ntrue disjunct (the second) is sufficient to render it true, and the\nfact that (22) has one false conjunct (the second) is sufficient to\nrender it false. Both sentences are thus predicted by the account to\nbe felicitous. The judgements might not be as clear in these cases,\nbut insofar as one judges these sentences to be infelicitous that is a\nchallenge for the SK approach.\n\n\nOne additional worry that has been raised against both the WK and the\nSK treatment of category mistakes (Thomason 1972, 231) is that not all\nclassical tautologies are deemed true on these logics. For example,\nboth logics render the following truth-valueless:\n\n(23)\nEither the number two is green or the number two\n    isn\u2019t green.\n\n\n\nWhile this is only to be expected on views which maintain that\n\u2018the number two is green\u2019 is meaningless or at least\ncontentless, it is arguably a less palatable consequence for the\ntruthvaluelessness view. An alternative view which avoids this\nconsequence is an account of category mistakes using supervaluationist\nlogic. The view is developed in detail in Thomason (1972), but in\nbroad terms it proceeds as follows: a valuation is an assignment of\nthe values true/false to each atomic sentence, where unproblematic\ninstances receive truth values as usual and category mistakes are\nassigned an arbitrary truth value. Complex sentences receive a truth\nvalue relative to each valuation in the standard recursive manner, and\nfinally a sentence is considered true if it is true relative\nto every valuation; false if it is false relative to every\nvaluation; and truth-valueless if it is true relative to some\nvaluations and false relative to others. This ensures that (23) is\ndeemed true because it is true relative to every valuation (one can\nprove that the same holds for all other classical\ntautologies). Moreover, it also deems existential quantifications such\nas (20) true and hence correctly predicts that they are felicitous.\nHowever, as with the SK approach, the supervaluationist treatment of\ncategory mistakes renders both (21) and (22) to be truth-valued, and\nhence (incorrectly?) predicts that they are felicitous.\n\n\nIn \u00a73.4 we will see yet another version of the truthvaluelessness\nview, which offers a different way of addressing the embedding of\ncategory mistakes in complex sentences.\n",
