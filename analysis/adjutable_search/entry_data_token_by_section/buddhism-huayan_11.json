    "main_text": "Chengguan (738\u2013839)\n6. Chengguan (738\u2013839)\n\nChengguan\u2019s life was marked by continual encounter with\ndifference. He lived through the reigns of nine Tang emperors, and his\nstudies ranged widely\u2014including Buddhist doctrines and\nmeditation practices, classic works indigenous to China, as well as\nthe Indian Vedas and works on Indian science. Tradition\nidentifies Chengguan as the fourth patriarch of the Huayan School,\nbecause he studied under Fashen (718\u2013778), who was a student of\nFazang\u2019s student Huiyuan (673\u2013743). \n\nChengguan was a voluminous writer. He authored a commentary (with an\naccompanying subcommentary) on the Avatamsaka Sutra that\ndisplaced Fazang\u2019s with respect to authority and influence, as\nwell as an influential commentary on Dushun\u2019s Discernments\nof the Dharmadhatu (Ch. Huayan fajie xuan jing;\nT45.1883, trans. Cleary 1983, 71\u2013124). He gave frequent lectures to\nimperial officials, and he wrote many essays at their request.\nChengguan\u2019s writings are notable for quoting frequently from\nChinese classics, borrowing words but not meanings for the sake of\nmaking his teaching accessible to educated literati. This style is\nlikely a response to the weakened political status of Buddhism\nfollowing the An Lushan rebellion (755\u2013763), which increased Chinese\nsuspicions of foreign traditions such as Buddhism and thereby\nheightened a need to show how Buddhist teachings harmonize with native\nChinese traditions. \n\nChengguan\u2019s most distinctive contribution to Huayan tradition is\nhis theory of the fourfold dharma-realm. This theory\nidentifies four ways of encountering the dharma-realm of\ndependent arising. Chengguan calls the first the dharma-realm\nof shi. Shi, for Chengguan, refers to form, mind,\nand other characteristics. Chengguan characterizes this realm as\nconditioned, akin to an illusion by virtue of lacking true substance\nand nature, and containing unreal characteristics. It is the\ndharma-realm encountered as particularized into innumerably\nmany distinct individuals. Chengguan calls the second\ndharma-realm the dharma-realm of li.\nChengguan understands li to refer to substance, nature,\nemptiness, quiescence, the immutable nature of all dharmas.\nHe characterizes this realm as identical with true nature. It is the\ndharma-realm encountered as originally pure and free from\ndefilement. \n\nChengguan groups the remaining two dharma-realms together as\ndharma-realms of non-obstruction. The third, the\ndharma-realm of non-obstruction among shi and\nli, correlates with the second discernment from\nDushun\u2019s Discernments of the Dharmadhatu. The fourth,\nthe dharma-realm of non-obstruction among shi and\nshi, correlates with the third discernment from\nDushun\u2019s Discernments of the Dharmadhatu. Chengguan\nendorses Dushun\u2019s analysis of these realms. He adds, to\nDushun\u2019s insights, the claim that the non-obstruction of\nli and shi is the foundation for the non-obstruction\namong shi. His meaning is twofold. From a practical\nperspective, he means that meditative insight into li is a\nprerequisite for meditative insight into shi. From a\ntheoretical perspective, he means that shi are mutually\nidentical and inclusive by virtue of their common penetration by\nli: since each shi is identical with and includes\nli, and since li is identical with and includes all\nshi, each shi is identical with and includes all\nother shi. \n\nChengguan further develops Huayan tradition by subsuming Chan\nteachings under the perfect teaching of Huayan. Huiyuan,\nFazang\u2019s disciple, had criticized Fazang\u2019s\npanjiao for including the Sudden Teaching. His criticism was\ntwofold. First, the Sudden Teaching does not belong, because\nFazang\u2019s panjiao ranks teachings with respect to their\ncontent but the sudden teaching\u2014as inexpressible\u2014lacks\ncontent. Second, if one ranks teachings with respect to how well they\nexpress truth about ultimate reality, then the Sudden Teaching, by\nvirtue of teaching the inexpressibility of ultimate truth, is distinct\nfrom neither the Final Teaching of Mahayana nor the Round Teaching.\n\n\nChengguan presents Huiyuan\u2019s panjiao as an artifact of\nhis impoverished understanding of Chan meditation practice. In\nresponse, and in an effort to defend Fazang\u2019s panjiao,\nChengguan develops his own panjiao. He identifies the Sudden\nTeaching with the teachings of various Chan traditions. These\nteachings, as Chengguan understands them, use words to express the\nidentity of mind and Buddha; and the direct mind-to-mind transmission\nof this truth suffices to distinguish Chan from other Buddhist\ntraditions\u2014with respect to practice if not content. \n\nDespite Chengguan\u2019s unfavorable evaluations of Huiyuan\u2019s\nteachings, Chengguan followed Huiyuan in explicitly criticizing\nindigenous Chinese teachings of the ru (Confucians) and the\nDaoists. He identifies the cardinal teaching of the ru\ntradition as the five constant virtues\u2014benevolence,\nrighteousness, propriety, wisdom, sincerity; the cardinal teaching of\nDaoism as spontaneity (Ch. ziran); and the cardinal teaching\nof Buddhism as causality (Ch. yinyuan). Chengguan\u2019s\ncriticisms center upon the claim that non-Buddhist teachings endorse a\nkind of pseudo-causality that abnegates responsibility for actions and\ndenigrates the role of wisdom. Against the Yijing (associated\nwith Confucians), he argues that locating the source of the myriad\nthings in the transformations of yin and yang\nascribes responsibility for wisdom or stupidity to the impersonal\nworkings of heaven, thereby denying the role of consciousness in\ncreating reality. He develops a similar criticism against the\nDaodejing, which locates the source of the myriad things in\nDao and denigrates practices of cultivation as superfluous. Against\nthe Zhuangzi, finally, he argues that the emphasis upon\nspontaneity as fundamental means that enlightenment arises without\ncause rather than through careful practice, and that this is erroneous\nby virtue of ignoring the way ignorance and enlightenment depend upon\nprior conditions. \n",
