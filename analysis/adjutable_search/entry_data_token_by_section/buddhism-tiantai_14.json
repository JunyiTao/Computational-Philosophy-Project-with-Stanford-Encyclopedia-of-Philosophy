    "main_text": "Practice and Doctrinal Diversity || Self-Overcoming of Doctrinal Hierarchy into Omniultimacy\n5.1 Self-Overcoming of Doctrinal Hierarchy into Omniultimacy\n\nTiantai takes the non-dualistic ideas suggested by the Lotus\nSutra in fables and unexplained narrative hints, and adapts the\nresources of Emptiness and the Two Truths to give them a full\nphilosophical explanation and practical application for Buddhist\npractice. The Lotus Sutra had made up\u0101ya the\ncenterpiece of Buddhism, and asserted a unity of all practices in the\nOne Vehicle, all leading toward Buddhahood. Tiantai follows this lead\nand constructs a vast and complex system for accounting for and\nintegrating all known forms of Buddhist and even non-Buddhist\npractice, all of which are acceptable skillful means appropriate and\nwholesome for different persons and times. It rejects nothing, but it\norganizes all known teachings and practices into an interconnected\nsystem. The system has an interesting double structure: the first time\nthrough, it appears to be hierarchical, putting the Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nabove the Hinayana and the Lotus above the rest of the\nMah\u0101y\u0101na. But the idea of redefinition of identity through\nrecontextualization is applied here, and when the hierarchical crown\nof the Lotus has done its work, it has the retroactive effect\nof making all the other parts equal as aspects of the One Vehicle.\nThat is, no teaching, practice or behavior has only a single meaning:\nits meaning is determined by the context in which it is viewed. So any\ngiven doctrine or practice can be seen as both the ultimate truth and\nas a more partial and only locally relevant, or lesser, truth. The\nTiantai system of integrating all the various teachings and ideas and\nperspectives in the world provides a system for seeing everything\ntwice, three times, infinite times, reassessing and developing the\nmeanings of each item as it comes into broader and broader relations.\nThe Hinayana teaching is, in the narrower context, a\n\u201clesser\u201d truth. But in the context of the One Vehicle, it\nis itself an instantiation of the One Vehicle, and even gives unique\nexpression to it: hence the claim (based on a clever strong misreading\nof a line from Kum\u0101raj\u012bva\u2019s translation of the\nLotus: \u6c7a\u4e86\u8072\u805e\u6cd5\n\u70ba\u8af8\u7d93\u4e4b\u738b) that the Hinayana doctrine\n(rather than the Lotus itself) is itself the Highest of All\nTeachings. The same goes for all other particular ideas, beliefs,\npractices. Since nothing has only one meaning, everything can\nmean anything. The interesting question about any proposition is not\nwhether it is true (it always is), but how. The\nTiantai \u201cclassification of teachings\u201d is an intricate and\ncomplex way of spelling out in what context and in what way each\ndoctrine means each of the many things it means.\n",
