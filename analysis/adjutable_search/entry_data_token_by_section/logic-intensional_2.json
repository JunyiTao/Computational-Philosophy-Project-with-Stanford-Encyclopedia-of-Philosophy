    "main_text": "A Brief History || Frege\n2.1 Frege\n\n\nThe modern understanding of intensional issues and problems begins\nwith a fundamental paper of Gottlob Frege, (Frege 1892). This paper\nopens with a recital of the difficulties posed by the notion of\nequality. In his earlier work, Frege notes, he had taken equality to\nrelate names, or signs, of objects, and not objects themselves. For\notherwise, if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) designate the same object,\nthere would be no cognitive difference between \\(a = a\\)\nand \\(a = b\\), yet the first is analytic while the\nsecond generally is not. Thus, he once supposed, equality relates\nsigns that designate the same thing. But, he now realizes, this cannot\nbe quite correct either. The use of signs is entirely arbitrary,\nanything can be a sign for anything, so in considering \\(a =\nb\\) we would also need to take into account the mode of\npresentation of the two signs\u2014what it is that associates\nthem with the things they designate. Following this line of thought,\nequality becomes a relation between signs, relative to their modes of\npresentation. Of course the notion of a mode of presentation is\nsomewhat obscure, and Frege quickly shifts attention elsewhere.\n\n\nA sign has both a reference, and what Frege calls a sense\n\u2014we can think of the sense as being some kind of embodiment of\nthe mode of presentation. From here on in his paper, sense is under\ndiscussion, and modes of presentation fade into the background. A name\nexpresses its sense, and designates its\nreference. Thus, \u201cmorning star\u201d and \u201cevening\nstar\u201d have the same designation, but express different senses,\nrepresenting different modes of presentation\u2014one is a celestial\nbody last seen in the morning before the sun obscures it, the other is\na celestial body first seen in the evening after the sun no longer\nobscures it. Frege goes on to complicate matters by introducing the\nidea associated with a sign, which is distinct from its sense\nand its reference. But the idea is subjective, varying from person to\nperson, while both sense and denotation are said by Frege to be not\ndependent in this way. Consequently the idea also fades into the\nbackground, while sense and reference remain central.\n\n\nGenerally when a sign appears as part of a declarative sentence, it is\nthe reference of the sign that is important. Both \u201cVenus\u201d\nand \u201cthe morning star\u201d designate the same object. The\nsentence \u201cThe morning star is seen in the sky near\nsunrise\u201d is true, and remains true when \u201cthe morning\nstar\u201d is replaced with \u201cVenus\u201d. Substitution of\nequi-designating signs preserves truth. But not always; there are\ncontexts in which this does not happen, indirect reference\ncontexts. As a typical example, \u201cGeorge knows that the morning\nstar is seen in the sky near sunrise\u201d may be true while\n\u201cGeorge knows that Venus is seen in the sky near sunrise\u201d\nmay be false. Besides knowledge contexts, indirect reference arises\nwhen a sentence involves \u201cI believe that\u2026\u201d,\n\u201cI think that\u2026\u201d, \u201cIt seems to me\nthat\u2026\u201d, \u201cIt is surprising that\u2026\u201d,\n\u201cIt is trivial that\u2026\u201d, and so on. In such contexts,\nFrege concludes, not designation but sense is central. Then, since\n\u201cGeorge knows that\u2026\u201d is an indirect reference\ncontext, senses are significant. The signs \u201cthe morning\nstar\u201d and \u201cVenus\u201d have different senses, we are not\nreplacing a sense by a sense equal to it, and so should not expect\ntruth to be preserved.\n\n\nFrege notes that an expression might have a sense, but not a\nreference. An example he gives is, \u201cthe least rapidly convergent\nseries.\u201d Of course an object might have several signs that\ndesignate it, but with different senses. Frege extends the\nsense/reference dichotomy rather far. In particular, declarative\nsentences are said to have both a sense and a reference. The sense is\nthe proposition it expresses, while the reference is its truth value.\nThen logically equivalent sentences have the same designation, but may\nhave different senses. In indirect contexts sense, and not\ndesignation, matters and so we may know the well-ordering principle\nfor natural numbers, but not know the principle of mathematical\ninduction because, while they are equivalent in truth value, they have\ndifferent senses.\n\n\nNo formal machinery for dealing with sense, as opposed to reference,\nis proposed in Frege 1892. But Frege defined the terms under which\nfurther discussion took place. There are two distinct but related\nnotions, sense and reference. Equality plays a fundamental role, and a\ncentral issue is the substitutivity of equals for equals. Names,\nsigns, expressions, can be equal in designation, but not equal in\nsense. There are both direct or extensional, and indirect or\nintensional contexts, and reference matters for the first while sense\nis fundamental for the second.\n",
