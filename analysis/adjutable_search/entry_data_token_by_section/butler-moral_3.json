    "main_text": "Conscience and the principles of human nature\n4. Conscience and the principles of human nature\n\nLike Shaftesbury, Butler held that conscience is a reflective\nprinciple. Shaftesbury asserted that \u201cevery reasoning or\nreflecting Creature is, by his Nature, forc\u2019d to endure the\nReview of his own Mind, and Actions; and to have Representations of\nhimself, and his inward Affairs, constantly passing before him,\nobvious to him, and revolving in his Mind\u201d (Shaftesbury 1699\nII.1 [119]). For Butler conscience is more specifically a reflection\non prospective or retrospective actions of oneself and others\naccording to moral principles. When we judge characters we reflect on\nactions in relation to the capacities of agents (\u201cDissertation\non Virtue\u201d \u00a75). Butler presumes that all ordinary human\nbeings have a sense of right and wrong in presuming that the moral\nprinciples are accessible for reflection, and that the many ways of\ndescribing this sense of right and wrong all point to one and the same\ncapacity: \u201cConscience, moral Reason, moral sense, or divine\nReason\u2026 as a Sentiment of the Understanding, or as a Perception\nof the Heart\u201d (\u201cDissertation on Virtue\u201d \u00a71).\nThere are a number of elements in the natural supremacy of conscience\nthat help us to understand the nature of its authority.\n\nFirst, according to Butler conscience has a unique authority among the\nprinciples belonging to human nature. As evidenced in the civil\nconstitution analogy, we recognize that it should direct other\nprinciples and not vice-versa and that the authority is proper to\nconscience and no other principle. Further we recognize that any\nordinary reasonable person has a conscience and ought to obey it. The\nterm \u201cconscience\u201d was commonly employed in both\ntheological and philosophical contexts (Shaftesbury identified it with\nreflective reason) but was also a legal term of art among the equity\nlawyers to whom Butler preached his sermons. In the legal context it\nhad the sense of acting minimally as an ordinary reasonable person\nwould and maximally as a fully informed, ideal reasoner would (see\nGarrett 2012).\n\nNext, conscience is closely connected to autonomy: when we act\naccording to conscience we act as a law unto ourselves or according to\na law of our own nature. By being a law unto oneself Butler seemed to\nmean being motivated by our inner sense of moral rightness and\nwrongness and not being motivated by considerations external to the\nrightness or wrongness of acting or not acting (Sermon III \u00a76).\nFor Butler, like Clarke, moral law, duty, obligation, or virtue, is\nright or wrong, morally good or bad independent of any punishment or\nreward (\u201cPreface\u201d \u00a7 29; \u201cDissertation on\nVirtue\u201d \u00a78). Butler criticized those forms of natural law\nand Hobbesian accounts of motivation that held that I am morally\nmotivated and given an authoritative reason for acting by a law\nsanctioned with rewards and punishments by a divine or civil\nlegislator. He argued that insofar as sanctions are superadded to the\nmoral rightness or wrongness of the act there is no connection between\nthe sanction and the rightness or wrongness of the action beyond the\narbitrary will of the legislator. This connection is insufficient for\nmoral motivation. When I act primarily or only due to an external\nsanction I am not acting from a law unto myself (see Darwall\n1992).\n\nThis law of conscience is readily accessible to us \u2014 \u201cthe\nmost near and intimate, the most certain and known\u201d\n(\u201cPreface,\u201d \u00a7 26) \u2014 in a way that probable\nconsequences of prudential or interested actions are not. That an\nauthoritative principle dictates that we ought to intend a good action\ndoes not depend on external factors that might prevent or mitigate the\ndesired prudential outcome (but see McNaughton 2012). Relatedly, ends\nmay vary but conscience is \u201cfixed, steady, and\nimmovable.\u201d\n\nButler argued in the Sermons that conscience was a principle superior\nto and governing of the particular passions, affections, and instincts\nand established a hierarchy among them (Sermon XIII \u00a77). As\npreviously discussed the hierarchy is natural. But due to ambiguities\nin Butler\u2019s presentation, in particular due to differences in\nthe aims of individual sermons, there are a number of ways to\nunderstand the relation between conscience and the other principles.\nOn one reading conscience is authoritative over the other main\nprinciples discussed by Butler \u2014 self-love and benevolence (if\nit is a principle \u2014 see Section 5) \u2014 and all when properly\nunderstood promote the same actions in accordance with our nature.\nWhen we seek our own goods and those of others in accordance with\nconscience or reflection we act virtuously and we also promote our\nprivate happiness. But, there are also passages that suggest that\nButler held self-love to be a principle on par with conscience\n(Sidgwick III.12 \u00a72) or even above it (Sermon IX \u00a715). And\nthere are passages where Butler suggests that benevolence contains all\nthe virtues, and consequently this too seems to be a principle on par\nwith or identical with conscience. Consequently there are multiple\nplausible hierarchies. Interpreters who advocate hierarchies which\nplace self-love or benevolence on par with (or even above) conscience\nnormally either argue that they are still consistent with the\nsupremacy of conscience or see this as showing a serious problem in\nButler\u2019s arguments.\n\nHere are few of the problems. If it is reasonable to obey conscience,\nthen \u201cthe rules that Conscience lays down\u201d are either\nreasonable in and of themselves or they are \u201cthe dictates of an\narbitrary authority\u201d (Sidgwick, III.13 \u00a72). If the latter,\nthen it is hard to see what justifies this arbitrary authority. But if\nthe former, then Sidgwick argues that there is no independent moral\nauthority for conscience \u2014 a conclusion which Sidgwick thought\nperfectly reasonable \u2014 and Butler is caught in the same\njustificatory circle that the Stoic arguments for life according to\nnature were: \u201cit is reasonable to live according to Nature, and\nit is natural to live according to Reason\u201d (ibid.). A related\nobjection is that since both conscience and self-love are rational\nprinciples and in general cannot be in conflict, conscience just\ndictates whatever self-love dictates and vice-versa. Consequently\nconscience cannot have a distinctive authority. Sturgeon identified a\ndifferent circularity connected with the justification of the\nsupremacy of conscience. Since Butler held that virtuous actions are\nthose in conformity to the nature of the agent and vicious ones not in\nconformity, according to Sturgeon \u201cthe doctrine of natural\nauthority of conscience is entirely superfluous\u201d (Sturgeon,\n316). This is because if conscience points to the wrongness of an\naction the wrongness must be due to the action\u2019s conformity or\nnon-conformity with our nature \u2014 i.e. due to a conflict among\nprinciples. Conscience can\u2019t be pointing to a conflict with\nitself since that would be circular. So it must be a conflict with the\nnext highest principle: self-interest. But then conscience just\nasserts what self-interest dictates, and so the testimony of\nconscience is redundant and has no special authority. Put differently,\nButler assumes that his argument that virtue is natural entails an\nargument for the supremacy of conscience. But there is no good reason\nto assume the entailment \u2014 in fact the two are not only\nindependent, but in conflict. There have been a number of responses to\nSturgeon. Penelhum, notably, denied that Butler was committed to the\n\u201cFull Naturalistic Thesis\u201d and argued that Butler instead\nheld \u201cthe independent existence of the judgments of right and\nwrong\u201d from judgments of \u201cnaturalness and\nunnaturalness\u201d (Penelhum 1990, 68; see also Irwin 2008 \u00a7707\nand McNaughton 2012).\n",
