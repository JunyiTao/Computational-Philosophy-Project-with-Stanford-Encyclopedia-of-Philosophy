    "main_text": "\n\nThe legal concept of evidence is neither static nor universal.\nMedieval understandings of evidence in the age of trial by ordeal\nwould be quite alien to modern sensibilities (Ho 2003\u20132004) and\nthere is no approach to evidence and proof that is shared by all legal\nsystems of the world today. Even within Western legal traditions,\nthere are significant differences between Anglo-American law and\nContinental European law (see Dama\u0161ka 1973, 1975, 1992, 1994,\n1997). This entry focuses on the modern concept of evidence that\noperates in the legal tradition to which Anglo-American law\n belongs.[1]\n It concentrates on evidence in relation to the proof of factual\nclaims in\n law.[2]\n\nIt may seem obvious that there must be a legal concept of\nevidence that is distinguishable from the ordinary concept of\nevidence. After all, there are in law many special rules on what can\nor cannot be introduced as evidence in court, on how evidence is to be\npresented and the uses to which it may be put, on the strength or\nsufficiency of evidence needed to establish proof and so forth. But\nthe law remains silent on some crucial matters. In resolving the\nfactual disputes before the court, the jury or, at a bench trial, the\njudge has to rely on extra-legal principles. There have been academic\nattempts at systematic analysis of the operation of these principles\nin legal fact-finding (Wigmore 1937; Anderson, Schum, and Twining\n2009). These principles, so it is claimed, are of a general nature. On\nthe basis that the logic in \u201cdrawing inferences from evidence to\ntest hypotheses and justify conclusions\u201d is governed by the same\nprinciples across different disciplines (Twining and Hampsher-Monk\n2003: 4), ambitious projects have been undertaken to develop a\ncross-disciplinary framework for the analysis of evidence (Schum 1994)\nand to construct an interdisciplinary \u201cintegrated science of\nevidence\u201d (Dawid, Twining, and Vasilaki 2011; cf. Tillers\n2008).\n\nWhile evidential reasoning in law and in other contexts may share\ncertain characteristics, there nevertheless remain aspects of the\napproach to evidence and proof that are distinctive to law (Rescher\nand Joynt 1959). Section 1 (\u201cconceptions of evidence\u201d)\nidentifies different meanings of evidence in legal discourse. When\nlawyers talk about evidence, what is it that they are referring to?\nWhat is it that they have in mind? Section 2 (\u201cconditions for\nreceiving evidence\u201d) approaches the concept of legal evidence\nfrom the angle of what counts as evidence in law. What are the\nconditions that the law imposes and must be met for something to be\nreceived by the court as evidence? Section 3 (\u201cstrength of\nevidence\u201d) shifts the attention to the stage where the evidence\nhas already been received by the court. Here the focus is on how the\ncourt weighs the evidence in reaching the verdict. In this connection,\nthree properties of evidence will be discussed: probative value,\nsufficiency, and degree of completeness.\n",
