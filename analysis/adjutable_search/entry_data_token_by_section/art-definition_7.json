    "main_text": "Contemporary Definitions || Institutional Definitions\n4.2 Institutional Definitions\n\n\nThe groundwork for institutional definitions was laid by Arthur Danto,\nbetter known to non-philosophers as the long-time influential art\ncritic for the Nation. Danto coined the term\n\u201cartworld\u201d, by which he meant \u201can atmosphere of art\ntheory.\u201d Danto\u2019s definition has been glossed as follows:\nsomething is a work of art if and only if (i) it has a subject (ii)\nabout which it projects some attitude or point of view (has a style)\n(iii) by means of rhetorical ellipsis (usually metaphorical) which\nellipsis engages audience participation in filling in what is missing,\nand (iv) where the work in question and the interpretations thereof\nrequire an art historical context (Danto, Carroll).  Clause (iv) is\nwhat makes the definition institutionalist.  The view has been\ncriticized for entailing that art criticism written in a highly\nrhetorical style is art, lacking but requiring an independent account\nof what makes a context art historical, and for not applying\nto music. \n\n\nThe most prominent and influential institutionalism is that of George\nDickie. Dickie\u2019s institutionalism has evolved over\ntime. According to an early version, a work of art is an artifact upon\nwhich some person(s) acting on behalf of the artworld has conferred\nthe status of candidate for appreciation (Dickie 1974).  Dickie\u2019s more\nrecent version consists of an interlocking set of five definitions:\n(1) An artist is a person who participates with understanding in the\nmaking of a work of art. (2) A work of art is an artifact of a kind\ncreated to be presented to an artworld public.  (3) A public is a set\nof persons the members of which are prepared in some degree to\nunderstand an object which is presented to them. (4) The artworld is\nthe totality of all artworld systems. (5) An artworld system is a\nframework for the presentation of a work of art by an artist to an\nartworld public (Dickie 1984). Both versions have been widely\ncriticized. Philosophers have objected that art created outside any\ninstitution seems possible, although the definition rules it out, and\nthat the artworld, like any institution, seems capable of error. It\nhas also been urged that the definition\u2019s obvious circularity is\nvicious, and that, given the inter-definition of the key concepts\n(artwork, artworld system, artist, artworld public) it lacks any\ninformative way of distinguishing art institutions systems\nfrom other, structurally similar, social institutions (D. Davies 2004,\npp. 248\u2013249, notes that both the artworld and the\n\u201ccommerceworld\u201d seem to fall under that definition). Early\non, Dickie claimed that anyone who sees herself as a member of the\nartworld is a member of the artworld: if this is true, then\nunless there are constraints on the kinds of things the artworld can\nput forward as artworks or candidate artworks, any entity can be an\nartwork (though not all are), which appears overly expansive. Finally,\nMatravers has helpfully distinguished strong and\nweak institutionalism. Strong institutionalism holds that\nthere is some reason that is always the reason the art institution has\nfor saying that something is a work of art. Weak institutionalism\nholds that, for every work of art, there is some reason or other that\nthe institution has for saying that it is a work of art (Matravers\n2000). Weak institutionalism, in particular, raises questions about\nart\u2019s unity: if absolutely nothing unifies the reasons that the\nartworld gives for conferring art-hood on things, then the unity of\nthe class of artworks is vanishingly small.  Conventionalist views,\nwith their emphasis on art\u2019s heterogeneity, swallow this\nimplication. From the perspective of traditional definitions, doings\nso underplays art\u2019s substantial if incomplete unity, while leaving it\na puzzle why art would be worth caring about.  \n Some recent versions of institutionalism depart from Dickie\u2019s by\naccepting the burden, which Dickie rejected, of providing a\nsubstantive, non-circular account of what it is to be an art\ninstitution or an artworld.  One, due to David Davies, does so by\nbuilding in Nelson Goodman\u2019s account of aesthetic symbolic\nfunctions. Another, due to Abell, combines Searle\u2019s account of social\ninstitutions with Gaut\u2019s characterization of art-making properties,\nand builds an account of artistic value on that coupling.\n\nDavies\u2019 neo-institutionalism holds that making an artwork\nrequires articulating an artistic statement, which requires specifying\nartistic properties, which in turn requires the manipulation of an\nartistic vehicle.  Goodman\u2019s \u201csymptoms of the\naesthetic\u201d are utilized to clarify the conditions under which a\npractice of making is a practice of artistic making: on\nGoodman\u2019s view, a symbol functions aesthetically when it is\nsyntactically dense, semantically dense, relatively replete, and\ncharacterized by multiple and complex reference (D. Davies 2004;\nGoodman 1968; see the entry on\n  Goodman\u2019s aesthetics).\nManipulating an artistic vehicle is in turn possible only if the\nartist consciously operates with reference to shared understandings\nembodied in the practices of a community of receivers. So art\u2019s\nnature is institutional in the broad sense (or, perhaps better,\nsocio-cultural).  By way of criticism, Davies\u2019\nneo-institutionalism may be questioned on the grounds that, since all\npictorial symbols are syntactically dense, semantically dense,\nrelatively replete, and often exemplify the properties they represent,\nit seems to entail that every colored picture, including those in any\ncatalog of industrial products, is an artwork (Abell 2012).\n\n\nAbell\u2019s institutional definition adapts Searle\u2019s view of social kinds:\nwhat it is for some social kind, F, to be F is for it to be\ncollectively believed to be F (Abell 2012; Searle 1995, 2010;\nand see the entry on\n  social institutions).\nOn Abell\u2019s view, more specifically, an institution\u2019s type is\ndetermined by the valued function(s) that it was collectively believed\nat its inception to promote. The valued functions collective belief in\nwhich make an institution an art institution are those spelled out by\nGaut in his cluster account (see section 3.1, above). That is,\nsomething is an art institution if and only if it is an institution\nwhose existence is due to its being perceived to perform certain\nfunctions, which functions form a significant subset of the following:\npromoting positive aesthetic qualities; promoting the expression of\nemotion; facilitating the posing of intellectual challenges, and the\nrest of Gaut\u2019s list. Plugging in Gaut\u2019s list yields the final\ndefinition: something is an artwork if and only if it is the product\nof an art institution (as just defined) and it directly effects the effectiveness with which that institution performs the perceived functions to which\nits existence is due. One worry is whether Searle\u2019s account of\ninstitutions is up to the task required of it. Some institutional\nsocial kinds have this trait: something can fail to be a token of that\nkind even if there is collective agreement that it counts as a token\nof that kind. Suppose someone gives a big cocktail party, to which\neveryone in Paris invited, and things get so out of hand that the\ncasualty rate is greater than the Battle of Austerlitz. Even if\neveryone thinks the event was a cocktail party, it is possible\n(contrary to Searle) that they are mistaken: it may have been a war or\nbattle. It\u2019s not clear that art isn\u2019t like this. If so, then the fact\nthat an institution is collectively believed to be an art institution\nneedn\u2019t suffice to make it so (Khalidi 2013; see also the entry on\n  social \ninstitutions).[3]\nA second worry: if its failure to specify which subsets of the ten\ncluster properties suffice to make something an artwork significantly\nflaws Gaut\u2019s cluster account, then failure to specify which subsets of\nGaut\u2019s ten properties suffice to make something an art institution\nsignificantly flaws Abellian institutionalism.\n",
