Introduction\n\nIn their moral theories, the ancient philosophers depended on several\nimportant notions. These include virtue and the virtues, happiness\n(eudaimonia), and the soul. We can begin with virtue.\n\nVirtue is a general term that translates the Greek word\naret\u00ea. Sometimes aret\u00ea is also\ntranslated as excellence. Many objects, natural or artificial, have\ntheir particular aret\u00ea or kind of excellence. There is\nthe excellence of a horse and the excellence of a knife. Then, of\ncourse, there is human excellence. Conceptions of human excellence\ninclude such disparate figures as the Homeric warrior chieftain and\nthe Athenian statesman of the period of its imperial expansion.\nPlato\u2019s character Meno sums up one important strain of thought\nwhen he says that excellence for a man is managing the business of the\ncity so that he benefits his friends, harms his enemies, and comes to\nno harm himself (Meno 71e). From this description we can see\nthat some versions of human excellence have a problematic relation to\nthe moral virtues.\n\nIn the ancient world, courage, moderation, justice and piety were\nleading instances of moral virtue. A virtue is a settled disposition\nto act in a certain way; justice, for instance, is the settled\ndisposition to act, let\u2019s say, so that each one receives their\ndue. This settled disposition consists in a practical knowledge about\nhow to bring it about, in each situation, that each receives their\ndue. It also includes a strong positive attitude toward bringing it\nabout that each receives their due. Just people, then, are not ones\nwho occasionally act justly, or even who regularly act justly but do\nso out of some other motive; rather they are people who reliably act\nthat way because they place a positive, high intrinsic value on\nrendering to each their due and they are good at it. Courage is a\nsettled disposition that allows one to act reliably to pursue right\nends in fearful situations, because one values so acting\nintrinsically. Moderation is the virtue that deals similarly with\none\u2019s appetites and emotions.\n\nHuman excellence can be conceived in ways that do not include the\nmoral virtues. For instance, someone thought of as excellent for\nbenefiting friends and harming enemies can be cruel, arbitrary,\nrapacious, and ravenous of appetite. Most ancient philosophers,\nhowever, argue that human excellence must include the moral virtues\nand that the excellent human will be, above all, courageous, moderate,\nand just. This argument depends on making a link between the moral\nvirtues and happiness. While most ancient philosophers hold that\nhappiness is the proper goal or end of human life, the notion is both\nsimple and complicated, as Aristotle points out. It seems simple to\nsay everyone wants to be happy; it is complicated to say what\nhappiness is. We can approach the problem by discussing, first, the\nrelation of happiness to human excellence and, then, the relation of\nhuman excellence to the moral virtues.\n\nIt is significant that synonyms for eudaimonia are living\nwell and doing well. These phrases imply certain activities associated\nwith human living. Ancient philosophers argued that whatever\nactivities constitute human living \u2013 e.g., those associated with\npleasure \u2013 one can engage in those activities in a mediocre or\neven a poor way. One can feel and react to pleasures sometimes\nappropriately and sometimes inappropriately; or one might always act\nshamefully and dishonorably. However, to carry out the activities that\nconstitute human living well over a whole lifetime, or long stretches\nof it, is living well or doing well. At this point the relation of\nhappiness to human excellence should be clear. Human excellence is the\npsychological basis for carrying out the activities of a human life\nwell; to that extent human excellence is also happiness.\n\nSo described, human excellence is general and covers many activities\nof a human life. However, one can see how human excellence might at\nleast include the moral virtues. The moral virtue relevant to fear,\nfor instance, is courage. Courage is a reliable disposition to react\nto fear in an appropriate way. What counts as appropriate entails\nharnessing fear for good or honorable ends. Such ends are not confined\nto one\u2019s own welfare but include, e.g., the welfare of\none\u2019s city. In this way, moral virtues become the kind of human\nexcellence that is other-regarding. The moral virtues, then, are\nexcellent qualities of character \u2013 intrinsically valuable for\nthe one who has them; but they are also valuable for others. In rough\noutline, we can see one important way ancient moral theory tries to\nlink happiness to moral virtue by way of human excellence. Happiness\nderives from human excellence; human excellence includes the moral\nvirtues, which are implicitly or explicitly other-regarding.\n\nSince happiness plays such a vital role in ancient moral theory, we\nshould note the difference between the Greek word eudaimonia\nand its usual translation as \u2018happiness\u2019. Although its\nusage varies, most often the English word \u2018happiness\u2019\nrefers to a feeling. For example, we say, \u201cYou can tell he feels\nhappy right now, from the way he looks and how he is behaving.\u201d\nThe feeling is described as one of contentment or satisfaction,\nperhaps with the way one\u2019s life as a whole is going. While some\nthink there is a distinction between feeling happy and feeling\ncontent, still happiness is a good and pleasant feeling. However,\n\u2018happiness\u2019 has a secondary sense that does not focus on\nfeelings but rather on activities. For instance, one might say,\n\u201cIt was a happy time in my life; my work was going well.\u201d\nThe speaker need not be referring to the feelings he or she was\nexperiencing but just to the fact that some important activity was\ngoing well. Of course, if their work is going well, they might feel\ncontentment. But in speaking of their happiness, they might just as\nwell be referring to their absorption in some successful activity. For\nancient philosophers eudaimonia is closer to the secondary\nsense of our own term. Happiness means not so much feeling a certain\nway, or feeling a certain way about how one\u2019s life as a whole is\ngoing, but rather carrying out certain activities or functioning in a\ncertain way. This sort of happiness is an admirable and praiseworthy\naccomplishment, whereas achieving satisfaction or contentment may not\nbe.\n\nIn this way, then, ancient philosophers typically justify moral\nvirtue. Being courageous, just, and moderate is valuable for the\nvirtuous person because these virtues are inextricably linked with\nhappiness. Everyone wants to be happy, so anyone who realizes the link\nbetween virtue and happiness will also want to be virtuous. This\nargument depends on two central ideas. First, human excellence is a\ngood of the soul \u2013 not a material or bodily good such as wealth\nor political power. Another way to put this idea is to say happiness\nis not something external, like wealth or political power, but an\ninternal, psychological good. The second central idea is that the most\nimportant good of the soul is moral virtue. By being virtuous one\nenjoys a psychological state whose value outweighs whatever other\nkinds of goods one might have by being vicious.\n\nFinally, a few words about the soul are in order since, typically,\nphilosophers argue that virtue is a good of the soul. In some ways,\nthis claim is found in many traditions. Many thinkers argue that being\nmoral does not necessarily provide physical beauty, health, or\nprosperity. Rather, as something good, virtue must be understood as\nbelonging to the soul; it is a psychological good. However, in order\nto explain virtue as a good of the soul, one does not have to hold\nthat the soul is immortal. While Plato, for example, holds that the\nsoul is immortal and that its virtue is a good that transcends death,\nhis argument for virtue as a psychological good does not depend on the\nimmortality of the soul. He argues that virtue is a psychological good\nin this life. To live a mortal human life with this good is in itself\nhappiness.\n\nThis position that links happiness and virtue is called eudaimonism\n\u2013 a word based on the principal Greek word for happiness,\neudaimonia. By eudaimonism, we will mean one of several\ntheses: (a) virtue, together with its active exercise, is identical\nwith happiness; (b) virtue, together with its activities, is the most\nimportant and dominant constituent of happiness; (c) virtue is the\nonly means to happiness. However, one must be cautious not to conclude\nthat ancient theories in general attempt to construe the value of\nvirtue simply as a means to achieving happiness. Each theory, as we\nshall see, has its own approach to the nature of the link between\nvirtue and happiness. It would not be advisable to see ancient\ntheories as concerned with such contemporary issues as whether moral\ndiscourse \u2013 i.e., discourse about what one ought to do \u2013\ncan or should be reduced to non-moral discourse \u2013 i.e., to\ndiscourse about what is good for one.\n\nThese reflections on virtue can provide an occasion for contrasting\nancient moral theory and modern. One way to put the contrast is to say\nthat ancient moral theory is agent-centered while modern\nmoral theory is action-centered. To say that it is\naction-centered means that, as a theory of morality, it explains\nmorality, to begin with, in terms of actions and their circumstances,\nand the ways in which actions are moral or immoral. We can roughly\ndivide modern thinkers into two groups. Those who judge the morality\nof an action on the basis of its known or expected consequences are\nconsequentialist; those who judge the morality of an action on the\nbasis of its conformity to certain kinds of laws, prohibitions, or\npositive commandments are deontologists. The former include, e.g.,\nthose utilitarians who say an action is moral if it provides the\ngreatest good for the greatest number. Deontologists say an action is\nmoral if it conforms to a moral principle, e.g., the obligation to\ntell the truth. While these thinkers are not uninterested in the moral\ndisposition to produce such actions, or in what disposition is\nrequired if they are to show any moral worth in the persons who do\nthem, their focus is on actions, their consequences, and the rules or\nother principles to which they conform. The result of these ways of\napproaching morality is that moral assessment falls on actions. This\nfocus explains, for instance, contemporary fascination with such\nquestions of casuistry as, e.g., the conditions under which an action\nlike abortion is morally permitted or immoral.\n\nBy contrast, ancient moral theory explains morality in terms that\nfocus on the moral agent. These thinkers are interested in what\nconstitutes, e.g., a just person. They are concerned about the state\nof mind and character, the set of values, the attitudes to oneself and\nto others, and the conception of one\u2019s own place in the common\nlife of a community that belong to just persons simply insofar as they\nare just. A modern might object that this way of proceeding is\nbackwards. Just actions are logically prior to just persons and must\nbe specifiable in advance of any account of what it is to be a just\nperson. Of course, the ancients had a rough idea of what just actions\nwere; and this rough idea certainly contributed to the notion of a\njust person, and his motivation and system of values. Still, the\nnotion of a just person is not exhausted by an account of the\nconsequences of just actions, or any principle for determining which\nactions are and which are not just. For the ancients, the just person\nis compared to a craftsman, e.g., a physician. Acting as a physician\nis not simply a collection of medically effective actions. It is\nknowing when such actions are appropriate, among other things; and\nthis kind of knowledge is not always definable. To understand what\nbeing a physician means one must turn to the physician\u2019s\njudgment and even motivation. These are manifested in particular\nactions but are not reducible to those actions. In the same way, what\nconstitutes a just person is not exhausted by the actions he or she\ndoes nor, for that matter, by any catalogue of possible just actions.\nRather, being a just person entails qualities of character proper to\nthe just person, in the light of which they decide what actions\njustice requires of them and are inclined or disposed to act\naccordingly.\n2. Socrates\n\nIn this section we confine ourselves to the character Socrates in\nPlato\u2019s dialogues, and indeed to only certain ones of the\ndialogues in which a Socrates character plays a role. In those\ndialogues in which he plays a major role, Socrates varies considerably\nbetween two extremes. On the one hand, there is the Socrates who\nclaims to know nothing about virtue and confines himself to asking\nother characters questions; this Socrates is found in the\nApology and in certain dialogues most of which end\ninconclusively. These dialogues, e.g., Charmides,\nLaches, Crito, Euthydemus, and\nEuthyphro, are called aporetic. On the other hand, in other\ndialogues we find a Socrates who expounds positive teachings about\nvirtue; this Socrates usually asks questions only to elicit agreement.\nThese dialogues are didactic, and conclusive in tone, e.g.,\nRepublic, Phaedo, Phaedrus, and Philebus. However,\nthese distinctions between kinds of dialogues and kinds of Socratic\ncharacters are not exclusive; there are dialogues that mix the\naporetic and conclusive styles, e.g., Protagoras, Meno, and\nGorgias. In observing these distinctions, we refer only to\nthe characteristic style of the dialogue and leave aside controversies\nabout the relative dates of composition of the dialogues. (See the\nentry on\n Plato,\n especially the section on\n Socrates\n and the section on\n the historical Socrates.)\n\nThe significance of this distinction among dialogues is that one can\nisolate a strain of moral teaching in the aporetic and mixed\ndialogues. In spite of their inconclusive nature, in the aporetic\ndialogues the character Socrates maintains principles about morality\nthat he seems to take to be fundamental. In the mixed dialogues we\nfind similar teaching. This strain is distinct enough from the\naccounts of morality in the more didactic dialogues that it has been\ncalled Socratic, as opposed to Platonic, and associated with the\nhistorical personage\u2019s own views. In what follows we limit\nourselves to this \u201cSocratic\u201d moral teaching \u2013\nwithout taking a position about the relation of \u201cSocratic\u201d\nmoral teaching to that of the historical Socrates. For our purposes it\nis sufficient to point out a distinction between kinds of moral\nteaching in the dialogues. We will focus on the aporetic dialogues as\nwell as the mixed dialogues Protagoras, Gorgias, and\nMeno.\n\nThe first feature of Socratic teaching is its heroic quality. In the\nApology, Socrates says that a man worth anything at all does\nnot reckon whether his course of action endangers his life or\nthreatens death. He looks only at one thing \u2013 whether what he\ndoes is just or not, the work of a good or of a bad man (28b\u2013c).\nSaid in the context of his trial, this statement is both about himself\nand a fundamental claim of his moral teaching. Socrates puts moral\nconsiderations above all others. If we think of justice as, roughly,\nthe way we treat others, the just actions to which he refers cover a\nwide range. It is unjust to rob temples, betray friends, steal, break\noaths, commit adultery, and mistreat parents (Rep\n443a\u2013b). A similarly strong statement about wrong-doing is found\nin the Crito, where the question is whether Socrates should\nsave his life by escaping from the jail in Athens and aborting the\nsentence of death. Socrates says that whether he should escape or not\nmust be governed only by whether it is just or unjust to do so (48d).\nObviously, by posing wrong-doing against losing one\u2019s life,\nSocrates means to emphasize that nothing outweighs in positive value\nthe disvalue of doing unjust actions. In such passages, then, Socrates\nseems to be a moral hero, willing to sacrifice his very life rather\nthan commit an injustice, and to recommend such heroism to others.\n\nHowever, this heroism also includes an important element of\nself-regard. In the passage from the Apology just quoted\nSocrates goes on to describe his approach to the citizens of Athens.\nHe chides them for being absorbed in the acquisition of wealth,\nreputation, and honor while they do not take care for nor think about\nwisdom, truth, and how to make their souls better (Ap.\n29d\u2013e). As he develops this idea it becomes clear that the\nperfection of the soul, making it better, means acquiring and having\nmoral virtue. Rather than heaping up riches and honor, Athenians\nshould seek to perfect their souls in virtue. From this exhortation we\ncan conclude that for Socrates psychological good outweighs material\ngood and that virtue is a psychological good of the first importance.\nThe Crito gives another perspective on psychological good.\nSocrates says (as something obvious to everyone) that life is not\nworth living if that which is harmed by disease and benefited by\nhealth \u2013 i.e., the body \u2013 is ruined. But even more so, he\nadds, life is not worth living if that which is harmed by wrong-doing\n(to adikon) and benefited by the right \u2013 sc.\nthe soul \u2013 is ruined, insofar as the soul is more valuable than\nthe body (47e\u201348a). We can understand this claim in positive\nterms. Virtue is the chief psychological good; wrong-doing destroys\nvirtue. So Socrates\u2019 strong commitment to virtue reflects his\nbelief in its value for the soul, as well as the importance of the\nsoul\u2019s condition for the quality of our lives.\n\nA second feature of Socratic teaching is its intellectualism. Socratic\nintellectualism is usually expressed in the claim that virtue is\nknowledge, implying that if one knows what is good one will do what is\ngood. We find a clear statement of the claim in Protagoras\n352c; but it underlies a lot of Socratic teaching. The idea is\nparadoxical because it flies in the face of what seems to be the\nordinary experience of knowingly doing what is not good, called\nakrasia or being overcome (sometimes anachronistically\ntranslated as weakness of will). However, Socrates defends the idea\nthat akrasia is impossible. First, he argues that virtue is\nall one needs for happiness. In the Apology (41c), Socrates\nsays that no evil at all can come to a good man either in living or in\ndying (\u2026ouk esti andri agath\u00f4(i) kakon ouden oute\nz\u00f4nti oute teleut\u00easanti), implying the good\nman\u2019s virtue alone makes him proof against bad fortune. In the\nCrito (48b), he says living well and finely and justly are\nthe same thing (to de eu kai kal\u00f4s kai dikai\u00f4s\n[z\u00ean] hoti tauton estin\u2026). In turn, in the Meno\n(77c\u201378b), Socrates argues that everyone desires happiness,\ni.e., one\u2019s own welfare. So, in the first place, one always has\na good reason for acting virtuously; doing so entails one\u2019s own\nhappiness. However, even if the link between virtue and happiness is\ngranted, another problem remains. It is possible that one can,\nknowingly, act against one\u2019s happiness, understood, as it is by\nSocrates, as one\u2019s own welfare. It seems that an individual can\nchoose to do what is not in her own best interest. People can all too\neasily desire and go after the pastry that they know is bad for them.\nSocrates, however, seems to think that once one recognizes (i.e.,\nreally knows and fully appreciates) that the pastry is not good in\nthis way, one will cease to desire it. There is no residual desire\nfor, e.g., pleasure, that might compete with the desire for what is\ngood. This position is called intellectualism because it implies that\nwhat ultimately motivates any action is some cognitive state, rational\nor doxastic: if you know what is good you will do it, and if you do an\naction, and it is bad, that is because you thought somehow that it was\ngood. All error in such choices is due to ignorance.\n\nIn support of the idea that if one knows what happiness is, one will\npursue it, Socrates argues, in the Euthydemus, that wisdom is\nnecessary and sufficient for happiness. While most of this dialogue is\ngiven over to Euthydemus\u2019 and Dionysiodorus\u2019 eristic\ndisplay, there are two Socratic interludes. In the first of these\n\u2013 in a passage that has a parallel in Meno (88a ff)\n\u2013 Socrates helps the young Cleinias to see that wisdom is a kind\nof knowledge that infallibly brings happiness. He uses an analogy with\ncraft (techn\u00ea); a carpenter must not only have but know\nhow to use his tools and materials to be successful (Euthyd.\n280b\u2013d). In turn, someone may have such goods as health, wealth,\ngood birth, and beauty, as well as the virtues of justice, moderation,\ncourage, and wisdom (279a\u2013c). Wisdom is the most important,\nhowever, because, like carpentry, for example, it is a kind of\nknowledge,\u00a0about how to use the other assets so that they are\nbeneficial (281b\u2013c). Moreover, all of these other so-called\ngoods are useless \u2013 in fact, even harmful \u2013 without\nwisdom, because without it one will misuse any of the other assets one\nmay possess, so as to act not well but badly. Wisdom is the only\nunconditional good (281d\u2013e). Socrates\u2019 argument leaves it\nambiguous whether wisdom (taken together with its exercise) is\nidentical with happiness or whether it is the dominant and essential\ncomponent of happiness (282a\u2013b).\n\nIn this account, the focus is on a kind of knowledge as the active\ningredient in happiness. The other parts of the account are certain\nassets that seem as passive in relation to wisdom as wood and tools\nare to the carpenter. Socratic intellectualism has been criticized for\neither ignoring the non-rational, desiderative and volitional causes\nof human action or providing an implausibly rationalist account of\nthem. In either case, the common charge is that it fails to account\nfor or appreciate the apparent complexities of moral psychology.\n3. Plato\n\nIf the objections to intellectualism are warranted, Plato makes\nsignificant progress by having his character Socrates suppose that the\nsoul has desires that are not always for what is good. This allows for\nthe complexities of moral psychology to become an important issue in\nthe account of virtue. That development is found in Plato\u2019s\nmature moral theory. In the Republic, especially in its first\nfour books, Socrates presents the most thorough and detailed account\nof moral psychology and virtue in the dialogues.\n\nIt all begins with the challenge to the very notion of morality,\nunderstood along traditional lines, mounted by Callicles in the second\nhalf of the Gorgias and by Thrasymachus in Republic\nI. Callicles thinks that moral convention is designed by the numerous\nweak people to intimidate the few strong ones, to keep the latter from\ntaking what they could if they would only use their strength. No truly\nstrong person should be taken in by such conventions (Gorg.\n482e ff). Thrasymachus argues that justice is the advantage of the\nmore powerful; he holds that justice is a social practice set up by\nthe powerful, i.e., rulers who require their subjects through that\npractice to act against their own individual and group self-interest\n(Rep. 338d ff). No sensible person should, and no\nstrong-willed person would, accept rules of justice as having any\nlegitimate authority over them. In answer to the latter challenge, in\nRepublic II, Glaucon and Adeimantus repeatedly urge Socrates\nto show what value justice has in itself, apart from its rewards and\nreputation. They gloss the intrinsic value of justice as what value it\nhas in the soul (358b\u2013c), what it does to the soul simply and\nimmediately by its presence therein. Before giving what will be a new\naccount of the soul, Socrates introduces his famous comparison between\nthe soul and the city. As he develops his account of the city,\nhowever, it becomes clear that Socrates is talking about an ideal\ncity, which he proceeds to construct in his discussion.\n\nThis city has three classes (gen\u00ea) of citizens. The\nrulers are characterized by their knowledge about and devotion to the\nwelfare of the city. The auxiliaries are the warrior class that helps\nthe rulers. These two are collectively the guardians of the city\n(413c\u2013414b; 428c\u2013d). Finally, there are the farmers,\nartisans, and merchants \u2013 in general those concerned with the\nproduction of material goods necessary for daily life\n(369b\u2013371e). The importance of this structure is that it allows\nSocrates to define virtues of the city by relations among its parts.\nThese virtues are justice, wisdom, courage, and moderation. For\ninstance, justice in the city is each one performing that function for\nwhich he is suited by nature and not doing the work that belongs to\nothers (433a\u2013b). One\u2019s function, in turn, is determined by\nthe class to which he belongs. So rulers should rule and not amass\nwealth, which is the function of the farmers, artisans, and merchants;\nif the rulers turn from ruling to money-making they are unjust.\n\nCompleting the analogy, Socrates gives an account of the soul. He\nargues that it has three parts, each corresponding to one of the\nclasses in the city. At this point, we should note the difficulty of\ntalking about parts of the soul. In making his argument about conflict\nin the soul, Socrates does not usually use a word that easily\ncorresponds to the English \u2018part.\u2019 Sometimes he uses\n\u2018form\u2019 (eidos) and \u2018kind\u2019\n(genos) (435b\u2013c), other times a periphrasis such as\n\u2018that in the soul that calculates\u2019 (439d\u2013e),\nalthough in the subsequent account of virtue, we do find\nmeros, which means part (442b\u2013d). So, insofar as\nvocabulary is concerned, one should be cautious about taking the\nsubdivisions of the soul to be independent agents. Perhaps the least\nmisleading way of thinking about the parts is as distinct functions.\nReason is the function of calculating, especially about what is good\nfor the soul. The appetites for food, drink, and sex are like the\nproducing class \u2013 they are necessary for bodily existence\n(439c\u2013e). These two parts are familiar to the modern reader, who\nwill recognize the psychological capacity for reasoning and\ncalculating, on the one hand, and the bodily desires, on the other.\nLess familiar is the part of the soul that corresponds to the\nauxiliaries, the military class. This is the spirited part\n(thymos or thymoeides). Associated with the heart,\nit is an aggressive drive concerned with honor. Thumos is\nmanifested as anger with those who attack one\u2019s honor. Perhaps\nmore importantly, it is manifested as anger with oneself when failing\nto do what one knows he should do (439e\u2013440d).\n\nThe importance of this account is that it is a moral psychology, an\naccount of the soul which serves as a basis for explaining the\nvirtues. Socrates\u2019 account also introduces the idea that there\nis conflict in the soul. For instance, the appetites can lead one\ntoward pleasure which reason recognizes is not good for the whole\nsoul. In cases of conflict, Socrates says the spirited part sides with\nreason against appetite. Here we see in rough outline the chief\ncharacters in a well-known moral drama. Reason knows what is good both\nfor oneself and in the treatment of others. The appetites,\nshort-sighted and self-centered, pull in the opposite direction. The\nspirited part is the principle that sides with reason and enforces its\ndecrees.\n\nWhile the opposition between reason and appetite establishes their\ndistinctness, it has another, more profound consequence. Most\ncommentators read this section of the argument as implying that reason\nlooks out for what is good for the soul while appetite seeks food,\ndrink, and sex, heedless of their benefit for the soul (437d ff).\nAlthough open to various interpretations, the difference between\nreason and appetite does seem aimed at one of the central paradoxes of\nSocratic intellectualism. Common experience seems to contradict the\nclaim that if one knows what is good he will do it; there seem to be\nobvious instances where someone does what she, in some sense, knows is\nnot good, while having options to act otherwise. By introducing\nnon-rational elements in the soul, the argument in the\nRepublic also introduces the possibility of doing what one\nknows, all things considered, not to be good. In such cases, one is\nmotivated by appetite, which lacks the capacity to conceive of what is\ngood, all things considered.\n\nSome interpret this heedlessness as appetite\u2019s being\ngood-independent, whereas reason is good-dependent. Thus, appetite\npursues what it pursues without reference to whether what it pursues\nis good; reason pursues what it pursues always understanding that what\nit pursues is good. In this kind of interpretation, Socrates in the\nRepublic accepts the possibility of akrasia because\nsome parts of the soul, which are indifferent to the good, can\nmotivate actions that do not aim at what is good. Others interpret\nthis heedlessness as appetite\u2019s operating on a constrained\nnotion of good; for instance, for appetite only pleasure is good. By\ncontrast, reason operates on a larger notion, i.e., what is good, all\nthings considered. In this interpretation, akrasia is also\npossible, but now because some parts of the soul, which motivate\naction, do so with a constrained view of good. In any event, the stage\nis set for conflict in the soul between reason and appetite. If we\nassume that either can motive action on its own, the possibility\nexists for the soul\u2019s pursuing bodily pleasure in spite of\nreason\u2019s determination that doing so is not good, all things\nconsidered. This potential gives rise to a separate strain of thinking\nabout virtue. While, for Socratic intellectualism, virtue just is\nknowledge, in the aftermath of the argument for subdividing the soul,\nvirtue comes to have two aspects. The first is to acquire the\nknowledge which is the basis of virtue; the second is to instill in\nthe appetites and emotions \u2013 which cannot grasp the knowledge\n\u2013 a docility so that they react in a compliant way to what\nreason knows to be the best thing to do. Thus, non-rational parts of\nthe soul acquire reliable habits on which the moral virtues\ndepend.\n\nGiven the complexity of the differences among the parts, we can now\nunderstand how their relations to one another define virtue in the\nsoul. Virtue reduces the potential for conflict to harmony. The master\nvirtue, justice, is each part doing its function and not interfering\nwith that of another (441d\u2013e; 443d). Since the function of\nreason is to exercise forethought for the whole soul, it should rule.\nThe appetites, which seek only their immediate satisfaction, should\nnot rule. A soul ruled by appetites is the very picture of\npsychological injustice. Still, to fulfill its function of ruling,\nreason needs wisdom, the knowledge of what is beneficial for each of\nthe parts of the soul and for the whole. Moderation is a harmony among\nthe parts based on agreement that reason should rule. Courage is the\nspirited part carrying out the decrees of reason about what is to be\nfeared (442b\u2013d). Any attentive reader of the dialogues must feel\nthat Socrates has now given an answer to the questions that started\nmany of the aporetic dialogues. At this point, we have the fully\ndeveloped moral psychology that allows the definition of the moral\nvirtues. They fall into place around the tripartite structure of the\nsoul.\n\nOne might object, however, that all Socrates has accomplished is to\ndefine justice and the other virtues as they operate within\nthe soul. While each part treats the others justly, so to speak, it is\nnot clear what justice among the parts of someone\u2019s soul has to\ndo with that person treating other people justly. Socrates at first\naddresses this issue rather brusquely, saying that someone with a just\nsoul would not embezzle funds, rob temples, steal, betray friends,\nbreak oaths, commit adultery, neglect parents, nor ignore the gods.\nThe reason for this is that each part in the soul does its own\nfunction in the matter of ruling and being ruled (443a\u2013b).\nSocrates does not explain this connection between psychic harmony and\nmoral virtue. However, if we assume that injustice is based in\noverweening appetite or unbridled anger, then one can see the\nconnection between restrained appetites, well-governed anger and\ntreating others justly. The man whose sexual appetite is not governed\nby reason, e.g., would commit the injustice of adultery.\n\nThis approach to the virtues by way of moral psychology, in fact,\nproves to be remarkably durable in ancient moral theory. In one way or\nanother, the various schools attempt to explain the virtues in terms\nof the soul, although there are, of course, variations in the\naccounts. Indeed, we can treat the theory of the Republic as\none such variation. While the account in Republic IV has\naffinities with that of Aristotle in Nicomachean\nEthics, for instance, further developments in\nRepublic V\u2013VII make Plato\u2019s overall account\naltogether unique. It is in these books that the theory of forms makes\nits appearance.\n\nIn Republic V, Socrates returns to the issue of political\nrule by asking what change in actual cities would bring the ideal city\ncloser to realization. The famous answer is that philosophers should\nrule as kings (473d). Trying to make the scandalous, even ridiculous,\nanswer more palatable, Socrates immediately begins to explain what he\nmeans by philosophers. They are the ones who can distinguish between\nthe many beautiful things and the one beautiful itself. The beautiful\nitself, the good itself, and the just itself are what he calls forms.\nThe ability to understand such forms defines the philosopher\n(476a\u2013c). Fully elaborated, this extraordinary theory holds that\nthere is a set of unchanging and unambiguous entities, collectively\nreferred to as being. These are known directly by reason in a way that\nis separate from the use of sensory perception. The objects of sensory\nperception are collectively referred to as becoming since they are\nchanging and ambiguous (508d). This infallible grasp means that one\nknows what goodness is, what beauty is, and what justice is. Because\nonly philosophers have this knowledge \u2013 an infallible grasp of\ngoodness, beauty, and justice \u2013 they and only they are fit to be\nrulers in the city.\n\nWhile moral theory occupies a significant portion of the\nRepublic, Socrates does not say a lot about its relation to\nthe epistemology and metaphysics of the central books. For instance,\none might have expected the account to show how, e.g., reason might\nuse knowledge of the forms to govern the other parts of the soul.\nIndeed, in Book VI, Socrates does say that the philosopher will\nimitate in his own soul the order and harmony of the forms out of\nadmiration (500c\u2013d). Since imitation is the heart of the account\nof moral education in Books II\u2013III, the idea that one might\nimitate forms is intriguing; but it is not developed. In fact, the\nrelation between virtues in the soul and the metaphysics and\nepistemology of the forms is not an easy one. For instance, Socrates\nsays that virtue in the soul is happiness (580b\u2013c). However, he\nalso says that knowledge and contemplation of the forms is happiness\n(517c\u2013d). Since having or exercising the virtues of wisdom,\nmoderation, courage, and justice is different from knowledge and\ncontemplation of forms, the questions naturally arises about how to\nbring the two together into an integrated life. In the dialogues, the\nrelation between knowledge of forms and virtues such as moderation,\njustice, and courage is an issue that never seems to be fully resolved\nbecause it receives different treatments.\n\nIn RepublicIX, Socrates offers a sketch of one way to bring\nthese two dimensions together. Toward the end of the book, Socrates\nconducts a three-part contest to show the philosophical, or\naristocratic, man is the happiest. In the second of these contests, he\nclaims that each part of the soul has its peculiar desire and\ncorresponding pleasure. Reason, for instance, desires to learn;\nsatisfying that desire is a pleasure distinct from the pleasure, e.g.,\nof eating (580d\u2013e). One can now see that the functions of each\nof the parts has a new, affective dimension. Then, in the last of the\ncontests, Socrates makes an ontological distinction between true\npleasure of the soul and less true pleasure of the body. The former is\nthe pleasure of knowing being, i.e., the forms, and the latter is the\npleasure of filling bodily appetite. The less true pleasures also give\nrise to illusions and phantoms of pleasure; these illusions and\nphantoms recall the images and shadows in the allegory of the cave\n(583b\u2013586c). Clearly, then, distinctions from the metaphysics\nand epistemology of the central books are being made relevant to the\ndivisions within the soul. Pleasures of reason are on a higher\nontological level than those of the bodily appetites; this difference\ncalls for a modification of the definitions of the virtues from Book\nIV. For instance, in Book IV, justice is each part fulfilling its own\nfunction; in Book IX, that function is specified in terms of the kinds\nof pleasure each part pursues. Reason pursues the true pleasure of\nknowing and the appetites the less true pleasure of the body. Appetite\ncommits injustice if it pursues pleasure not proper to it, i.e., if it\npursues bodily pleasures as though they were true pleasures\n(586d\u2013587a). The result is an account of virtue which\ndiscriminates among pleasures, as any virtue ethics should; but the\ncriterion of discrimination reflects the distinction between being and\nbecoming. Rational pleasures are more real than bodily pleasures,\nalthough bodily pleasures are not negligible. Happiness, in turn,\nintegrates the virtue of managing bodily appetites and pleasures with\nthe pleasures of learning, but definitely gives greater weight to the\nlatter.\n\nHowever, in the Phaedo, we find another approach to the\nrelation between knowledge of forms and virtues in the soul. Socrates\nidentifies wisdom with kowledge of such forms as beauty, justice, and\ngoodness (65d\u2013e). The philosopher can know these only by reason\nthat is detached from the body as much as possible (65e\u201366a). In\nfact, pure knowledge is found only when the soul is completely\ndetached from the body in death. With such a severe account of the\nknowledge of the forms it is not surprising that courage, justice, and\nmoderation are subordinated to wisdom. When Socrates says the true\nexchange of pleasures, pains, and fears is for wisdom, he invokes\nmoderation, justice, and courage as virtues that serve this exchange\n(68b\u201369e). This passage suggests, for instance, that moderation\nwould control bodily pleasures and pains and fears so that reason\ncould be free of these disturbances in order to pursue knowledge. This\nnotion of virtues differs from the account in the first books of the\nRepublic in that the latter presents a comprehensive picture\nof the welfare of all the parts of the soul whereas the\nPhaedo, by implication, subordinates to reason those parts\ncharacterized by pleasures, pain, and fears.\n\nIn the Symposium, we find yet another configuration of the\nrelation between virtue and the forms, in which the non-rational parts\nof the soul disappear \u2013 or are sublimated. In Diotima\u2019s\ndiscourse on eros, she argues that the real purpose of love\nis to give birth in beauty (206b\u2013c). This idea implies two\ndimensions: inspiration by what is itself beautiful and producing\nbeautiful objects. Although Diotima talks about the way these concepts\nwork in sexual procreation, her real interest is in their\npsychological manifestations. For instance, the lover, inspired by the\nphysical beauty of the beloved, will produce beautiful ideas. In turn,\nthe beauty of a soul will inspire ideas that will improve young men\n(210a\u2013d). Finally, Diotima claims that the true object of erotic\nlove is not the beautiful body or even the beautiful soul \u2013 but\nbeauty itself. Unlike the beauty of bodies and of souls, this beauty\ndoes not come to be nor pass away, neither increases nor decreases.\nNor does it vary according to aspect or context. It is not in a face\nor hands but is itself by itself, one in form (211a\u2013c). Since\nthis paradigm of beauty is the true object of eros, it\ninspires its own particular product, i.e., true virtue, distinct from\nthe images of virtue inspired by encounters with beauty in bodies and\nsouls (212a\u2013c). While this passage highlights the relation\nbetween eros and the form of beauty in motivating virtue, it\nis almost silent on what this virtue might be. We do not know whether\nit just is the expression of love of beauty in the lover\u2019s\nactions, or its concretization in the dispositions of the\nlover\u2019s soul, or another manifestation. Clearly, this account in\nthe Symposium works without the elaborate theory about parts\nof the soul and their function in virtue, found in Republic\nI\u2013IV.\n\nAs with other ancient theories, this account of virtue can be called\neudaimonist. Plato\u2019s theory is best represented as holding that\nvirtue, together with its active exercise, is the most important and\nthe dominant constituent of happiness (580b\u2013c). One might object\nthat eudaimonist theories reduce morality to self-interest. We should\nrecall however that eudaimonia in this theory does not refer\nprimarily to a feeling. In the Republic, it refers to a state\nof the soul, and the active life to which it leads, whose value is\nmultifaceted. The order and harmony of the soul is, of course, good\nfor the soul because it provides what is good for each of the parts\nand the whole, and so makes the parts function well, for the benefit\nof each and of the whole person. In this way, the soul has the best\ninternal economy, so to speak. Still, we should not overlook the ways\nin which order and harmony in the soul are paired with order and\nharmony in the city. They are both modeled on the forms. As a\nconsequence, virtue in the soul is not a private concern artificially\njoined to the public function of ruling. Rather, the philosopher who\nimitates forms in ruling her soul is equally motivated to imitate\nforms in ruling the city. So, insofar as virtue consists in imitating\nthe forms, it is also a state of the soul best expressed by exercising\nrule in the city \u2013 or at least in the ideal city.\nEudaimonia, then, includes looking after the welfare of\nothers.\n\nIndeed, the very nature of Plato\u2019s account of virtue and\nhappiness leaves some aspects of the link between the two unclear.\nWhile virtue is the dominant factor in happiness, we still cannot tell\nwhether for Plato one can have a reason for being, e.g., courageous\nthat does not depend directly on happiness. Plato, even though he has\nforged a strong link between virtue and happiness, has not addressed\nsuch\u00a0issues. In his account, it is still possible that one might\nbe courageous just for its own sake while at the same time believing\ncourage is also reliably linked to happiness. In the\nRepublic, Socrates tries to answer the question what value\njustice has by itself in the soul; it does not follow that he is\ntrying to convince Glaucon and Adeimantus that the value of justice is\nexhausted by its connection to one\u2019s own happiness.\n\n(For further developments in Plato\u2019s moral theory in dialogues\nusually thought to postdate the Republic (especially\nPhilebus), see\n Plato\n entry, especially the section on\n Socrates\n and the section on\n Plato\u2019s indirectness.)\n4. Aristotle\n\nThe moral theory of Aristotle, like that of Plato, focuses on virtue,\nrecommending the virtuous way of life by its relation to happiness.\nHis most important ethical work, Nicomachean Ethics, devotes\nthe first book to a preliminary account of happiness, which is then\ncompleted in the last chapters of the final book, Book X. This account\nties happiness to excellent activity of the soul. In subsequent books,\nexcellent activity of the soul is tied to the moral virtues and to the\nvirtue of \u201cpractical wisdom\u201d \u2013 excellence in\nthinking and deciding about how to behave. This approach to moral\ntheory depends on a moral psychology that shares a number of\naffinities with Plato\u2019s. However, while for Plato the theory of\nforms has a role in justifying virtue, Aristotle notoriously rejects\nthat theory. Aristotle grounds his account of virtue in his theory\nabout the soul \u2013 a topic to which he devotes a separate\ntreatise, de Anima.\n\nAristotle opens the first book of the Nicomachean Ethics by\npositing some one supreme good as the aim of human actions,\ninvestigations, and crafts (1094a). Identifying this good as\nhappiness, he immediately notes the variations in the notion\n(1095a15\u201325). Some think the happy life is the life of\nenjoyment; the more refined think it is the life of political\nactivity; others think it is the life of study or theoretical\ncontemplation (1095b10\u201320). The object of the life of enjoyment\nis bodily pleasure; that of political activity is honor or even\nvirtue. The object of the life of study is philosophical or scientific\nunderstanding. Arguing that the end of human life must be the most\ncomplete, he concludes that happiness is the most complete end.\nWhereas pleasure, honor, virtue, and understanding are choice-worthy\nin themselves, they are also chosen for the sake of happiness.\nHappiness is not chosen for the sake of anything else\n(1097a25\u20131097b5). That the other choice-worthy ends are chosen\nfor the sake of happiness might suggest that they are chosen only as\ninstrumental means to happiness, as though happiness were a separate\nstate. However, it is more likely that the other choice-worthy ends\nare constituents of happiness. As a consequence, the happy life is\ncomposed of such activities as virtuous pursuits, honorable acts, and\ncontemplation of truth. While conceiving these choice-worthy ends as\nconstituents of happiness might be illuminating, it does, in turn,\nraise the issue of whether happiness is a jumble of activities or\nwhether it requires organization \u2013 even prioritization \u2013\nof the constituents.\n\nNext, Aristotle turns to his own account of happiness, the summit of\nBook I. The account depends on an analogy with the notion of function\nor characteristic activity or work (ergon). A flutist has a\nfunction or work, i.e., playing the flute. The key idea for Aristotle\nis that the good of flute players (as such) is found in their\nfunctioning as a flutist. By analogy, if there is a human function,\nthe good for a human is found in this function (1097b20\u201330).\nAristotle then turns to the human soul. He argues that, in fact, there\nis a human function, to be found in the human soul\u2019s\ncharacteristic activity, i.e., the exercise of reason\n(1098a1\u201320). Then, without explanation, he makes the claim that\nthis rational function is expressed in two distinct ways: by\ndeliberating and issuing commands, on the one hand, and by obeying\nsuch commands, on the other. The part that has reason in itself\ndeliberates about decisions, both for the short term and the long. The\npart that obeys reason is that aspect of the soul, such as the\nappetites, that functions in a human being under the influence of\nreason. The appetites can fail to obey reason; but they at least have\nthe capacity to obey (as, for example, such autonomic functions as\nnutritive and metabolic ones do not).\n\nAristotle then argues that since the function of a human is to\nexercise the soul\u2019s activities according to reason, the function\nof a good human is to exercise well and finely the soul\u2019s\nactivities according to reason. Given the two aspects of reason that\nAristotle has distinguished, one can see that both can be well or\nbadly done. On the one hand, one can reason well or badly \u2013\nabout what to do within the next five minutes, twenty-four hours, or\nten years. On the other, actions motivated by appetites can be well or\nbadly done, and likewise having an appetite at all can sometimes not\nbe a well done, but a badly done, activity of the soul. Acting on the\ndesire for a drink from the wine cooler at a banquet is not always a\ngood idea, nor is having such a desire. According to Aristotle, the\ngood human being has a soul in which these functions are consistently\ndone well. Thus, good persons reason well about plans, short term or\nlong; and when they satisfy their appetites, and even when they\nhave appetites, it is in conformity with reason. Returning to\nthe question of happiness, Aristotle says the good for a human is to\nlive the way the good human lives, that is, to live with one\u2019s\nlife aimed at and structured by the same thing that the good human\nbeing aims at in his or her life. So, his account of happiness, i.e.,\nthe highest good for a human, is virtuous or excellent activity of the\nsoul. But he has not identified this virtuous activity with that of\nthe moral virtues, at this point. In fact, he says if there are many\nkinds of excellence, then human good is found in the active exercise\nof the highest. He is careful to point out that happiness is not just\nthe ability to function well in this way; it is the activity itself.\nMoreover, this activity must be carried out for a complete life. One\nswallow does not make a spring.\n\nAlthough the reference here to parts or aspects of the soul is\ncursory, it is influenced by Aristotle\u2019s theories in the de\nAnima. Fundamental to the human soul and to all living things,\nincluding plants, is nutrition and growth (415a20 ff). Next is\nsensation and locomotion; these functions are characteristic of\nanimals (416b30 ff). Aristotle associates appetite and desire with\nthis part of the soul (414b1\u20135). Thus we have a rough sketch of\nanimal life: animals, moved by appetite for food, go toward the\nobjects of desire, which are discerned by sensation. To these\nfunctions is added thought in the case of humans. Thought is both\ntheoretical and practical (427a 15\u201320). The bulk of the de\nAnima is devoted to explaining the nutritive, sensory, and\nrational functions; Aristotle considers desire and appetite as the\nsource of movement in other animals (432a15 ff), and these plus reason\nas its source in humans. In Nicomachean Ethics he focuses on\nthe role that appetite and desire, together with reason, play in the\nmoral drama of human life.\n\nIn chapter 8 of Book I, Aristotle explicitly identifies human good\nwith psychological good. Dividing goods into external goods, those of\nthe body, and those of the soul, he states that his account of\nhappiness agrees with those who hold it is a good of the soul. In\nfact, in this account, happiness is closely related to traditionally\nconceived psychological goods such as pleasure and moral virtue,\nalthough the nature of the relation has yet to be shown\n(1098b10\u201330). Still, in Book I Aristotle is laying the\nfoundation in his moral psychology for showing the link between the\nmoral virtues and happiness. In Book II he completes this foundation\nwhen he turns to the question of which condition of the soul is to be\nidentified with (moral) virtue, or virtue of character.\n\nIn II. 5, he says that conditions of the soul are either feelings\n(path\u00ea), capacities for feeling (dynameis) or\ndispositions (hexeis). Feelings are such things as appetite,\nanger, fear and generally those conditions that are accompanied by\npleasure and pain. Capacities are, for example, the simple capacity to\nhave these feelings. Finally, disposition is that condition of the\nsoul whereby we are well or badly off with respect to feelings. For\ninstance, people are badly disposed with respect to anger who\ntypically get angry violently or who typically get angry weakly\n(1105b20\u201330). Virtue, as a condition of the soul, will be one of\nthese three. After arguing that virtue is neither feeling nor\ncapacity, Aristotle turns to what it means to be well or badly off\nwith respect to feelings. He says that in everything that is\ncontinuous and divisible it is possible to take more, less, or an\nequal amount (1106a25). This remark is puzzling until we realize that\nhe is actually talking about feelings. Feelings are continuous and\ndivisible; so one can take more, less, or an equal amount of them.\nPresumably, when it comes to feeling anger, e.g., one can feel too\nmuch, not enough, or a balanced amount. Aristotle thinks that what\ncounts as too much, not enough, or a balanced amount can vary to some\nextent from individual to individual. At this point he is ready to\ncome back to moral virtue for it is concerned with feelings and\nactions (to which feelings give rise), in which one can have excess,\ndeficiency, or the mean. To have a feeling like anger at the right\ntime, on the right occasion, towards the right people, for the right\npurpose and in the right manner is to feel the right amount, the mean\nbetween extremes of excess and deficiency; this is the mark of moral\nvirtue (1106a15\u201320). Finally, virtue is not a question only of\nfeelings since there is a mean between extremes of action. Presumably,\nAristotle means that the appropriate feeling \u2013 the mean between\nthe extremes in each situation \u2013 gives rise to the appropriate\naction.\n\nAt last Aristotle is ready to discuss particular moral virtues.\nBeginning with courage, he mentions here two feelings, fear and\nconfidence. An excessive disposition to confidence is rashness and an\nexcessive disposition to fear and a deficiency in confidence is\ncowardice. When it comes to certain bodily pleasures and pains, the\nmean is moderation. While the excess is profligacy, deficiency in\nrespect of pleasures almost never occurs. Aristotle gives a fuller\naccount of both of these virtues in Book III; however, the basic idea\nremains. The virtue in each case is a mean between two extremes, the\nextremes being vices. Virtue, then, is a reliable disposition whereby\none reacts in relevant situations with the appropriate feeling \u2013\nneither excessive nor deficient \u2013 and acts in the appropriate\nway \u2013 neither excessively nor deficiently.\n\nTo complete the notion of moral virtue we must consider the role\nreason plays in moral actions. Summing up at Book II.6, Aristotle says\nvirtue is a disposition to choose, lying in the mean which is relative\nto us, determined by reason (1107a1). Since he is talking about\nchoosing actions, he is focusing on the way moral virtue issues in\nactions. In turn, it is the role of practical wisdom\n(phron\u00easis) to determine choice. While moral virtues,\nvirtues of character, belong to the part of the soul which can obey\nreason, practical wisdom is a virtue of the part of the soul that\nitself reasons. The virtues of thought, intellectual virtues, are\nknowledge (epist\u00eam\u00ea), comprehension\n(nous), wisdom (sophia), craft\n(techn\u00ea), and practical wisdom (1139b15\u201325). The\nfirst three grasp the truth about what cannot be otherwise and is not\ncontingent. A good example of knowledge about what cannot be otherwise\nis mathematics. Craft and practical wisdom pursue the truth that can\nbe had about what can be otherwise and is contingent. What can be\notherwise includes what is made \u2013 the province of craft \u2013\nand what is done \u2013 the province of practical wisdom (1140a1).\nWhile Aristotle\u2019s account of practical wisdom raises several\nproblems, we will focus on only two closely related issues. He says\nthat it is the mark of someone with practical wisdom to deliberate\nwell about what leads to the good for himself (to dunasthai\nkal\u00f4s bouleusasthai peri ta haut\u00f4(i) agatha). This\ngood is not specific, such as health and strength, but is living well\nin general (1140a25\u201330). This description of practical wisdom,\nfirst of all, implies that it deliberates about actions; it is a skill\nfor discerning those actions which hit the mean between the two\nextremes. However, the ambiguity of the phrase \u2018what leads to\nthe good\u2019 might suggest that practical wisdom deliberates only\nabout instrumental means to living well. Still since practical wisdom\ndetermines which actions hit the mean between two extremes, such\nactions are not instrumental means to living well \u2013 as though\nliving well were a separate state. Actions which hit the mean are\nparts of living well; the good life is composed of actions under the\nheadings of, for instance, honor and pleasure, which achieve the mean.\nIn addition, the deliberation of practical wisdom does not have to be\nconfined to determining which actions hit the mean. While Aristotle\nwould deny that anyone deliberates about whether happiness is the end\nof human life, we do deliberate about the constituents of happiness.\nSo, one might well deliberate about the ways in which honor and\npleasure fit into happiness.\n\nNow we can discern the link between morality and happiness. While\nhappiness itself is excellent or virtuous activity of the soul, moral\nvirtue is a disposition to achieve the mean between two extremes in\nfeeling and in action. The missing link is that achieving the mean is\nalso excellent activity of the soul. Activity that expresses the\nvirtue of courage, for example, is also the best kind of activity when\nit comes to the emotion of fear. Activity that expresses the virtue of\nmoderation is also excellent activity when it comes to the bodily\nappetites. In this way, then, the happy person is also the virtuous\nperson. However, in Book I Aristotle has already pointed out the\nproblem of bodily and external goods in relation to happiness. Even if\nhappiness is virtuous activity of the soul, in some cases these goods\nare needed to be virtuous \u2013 for example, one must have money to\nbe generous. In fact, the lack of good birth, good children, and\nbeauty can mar one\u2019s happiness for the happy person does not\nappear to be one who is altogether ugly, low born, solitary, or\nchildless, and even less so if he has friends and children who are\nbad, or good friends and children who then die\n(1099a30\u20131099b10). Aristotle is raising a problem that he does\nnot attempt to solve in this passage. Even if happiness is virtuous\nactivity of the soul, it does not confer immunity to the vicissitudes\nof life.\n\nAristotle\u2019s moral psychology has further implications for his\naccount of happiness. In Book I, chapter 7, he said that human good is\nvirtuous activity of the soul but was indefinite about the virtues. In\nmost of the Nicomachean Ethics he talks about the moral\nvirtues, leaving the impression that virtuous activity is the same as\nactivity associated with moral virtues. In Book X, however, Aristotle\nrevisits the issue of virtuous activity. If happiness, he says, is\nactivity in accordance with virtue, it will be activity in accordance\nwith the highest. The highest virtue belongs to the best part of the\nsoul, i.e., the intellect (nous) or the part that governs in\nthe soul and contemplates the fine and godly, being itself the divine\npart of the soul or that which is closest to the divine\n(1177a10\u201320). Up to this point, Aristotle has apparently been\ntalking about the man of political action and the happiness that is\nsuitable to rational, embodied human beings. Active in the life of the\ncity, this person exercises courage, moderation, liberality, and\njustice in the public arena. Now, instead of the life of an effective\nand successful citizen, Aristotle is holding up the life of study and\ncontemplation as the one that achieves happiness \u2013 that is, the\nhighest human good, the activity of the highest virtue. Such a life\nwould achieve the greatest possible self-sufficiency and\ninvulnerability (1177a30). Indeed, at first he portrays these two\nlives as so opposite that they seem incompatible.\n\nIn the end, however, he palliates the differences, leaving the\npossibility for some way to harmonize the two (1178a30). The\ndifferences between the two lives are rooted in the different aspects\nof the soul. Moral virtues belong to the appetites and desires of the\nsensory soul \u2013 the part obviously associated with the active\npolitical life, when its activities are brought under the guidance and\ncontrol of excellent practical thought and judgment. The\n\u201chighest\u201d virtues, those belonging to the scientific or\nphilosophical intellect, belong to theoretical reason. To concentrate\non these activities one must be appropriately disengaged from active\npolitical life. While the latter description leads Aristotle to\nportray as possible a kind of human life that partakes of divine\ndetachment (1178b5 ff), finally human life is an indissolvable\ncomposite of intellect, reason, sensation, desires, and appetites. For\nAristotle, strictly speaking, happiness simply is the\nexercise of the highest virtues, those of theoretical reason and\nunderstanding. But even persons pursuing those activities as their\nhighest good, and making them central to their lives, will need to\nremain connected to daily life, and even to political affairs in the\ncommunity in which they live. Hence, they will possess and exercise\nthe moral virtues and those of practical thought, as well as those\nother, higher, virtues, throughout their lives. Clearly, this\nconception of happiness does not hold all virtue, moral and\nintellectual, to be of equal value. Rather, Aristotle means the\nintellectual virtue of study and contemplation to be the dominant part\nof happiness. However, problems remains since we can understand\ndominance in two ways. In the first version, the activity of\ntheoretical contemplation is the sole, exclusive component of\nhappiness and the exercise of the moral virtues and practical wisdom\nis an instrumental means to happiness, but not integral to it. The\nproblem with this version of dominance is that it undermines what\nAristotle has said about the intrinsic value of the virtuous activity\nof politically and socially engaged human beings, including\nfriendship. In a second version of dominance, we might understand\ncontemplation to be the principal, but not exclusive, constituent of\nhappiness. The problem with this version of dominance lies in\nintegrating such apparently incompatible activities into a coherent\nlife. If we give the proper weight to the divine good of theoretical\ncontemplation it may leave us little interest in the virtuous pursuits\nof the moral goods arising from our political nature, except, again,\nas means for establishing and maintaining the conditions in which we\nmay contemplate.\n\nLike Plato, Aristotle is a eudaimonist in that he argues that virtue\n(including in some way the moral virtues of courage, justice and the\nrest) is the dominant and most important component of happiness.\nHowever, he is not claiming that the only reason to be morally\nvirtuous is that moral virtue is a constituent of happiness. He says\nthat we seek to have virtue and virtuous action for itself as well\n(Nicomachean Ethics, 1097b 1\u201310); not to do so is to\nfail even to be virtuous. In this regard, it is like\npleasure, which is also a constituent of the happy life. Like\npleasure, virtue is sought for its own sake. Still, as a constituent\nof happiness, virtuous action is grounded in the highest end for a\nhuman being. One can discern in the Nicomachean Ethics two\ndifferent types of argument for the link between virtue and happiness.\nOne is based on Aristotle\u2019s account of human nature and\nculminates in the so-called function argument of Book I. If happiness\nis excellent or virtuous activity of the soul, the latter is\nunderstood by way of the uniquely human function. If one understands\nthe human function then one can understand what it is for that\nfunction to be done excellently (1098a5\u201315). This sort of\nargument has been criticized because it moves from a premise about\nwhat humans are to a conclusion about what they ought to be. Such\ncriticism reflects the modern claim that there is a fact-value\ndistinction. One defense of Aristotle\u2019s argument holds that his\naccount of human nature is meant both to be objective and to offer the\nbasis for an understanding of excellence. The difference, then,\nbetween modern moral theory and ancient is over what counts as an\nobjective account of human nature. However, even if we accept this\ndefense, we can still ask why a human would consider it good to\nachieve human excellence as it is defined in the function argument. At\nthis point another argument for the link between happiness and virtue\n\u2013 one more dispersed in the text of the Nicomachean\nEthics \u2013 becomes relevant; it is based on value terms only\nand appeals to what a human might consider it good to achieve.\nAristotle describes virtuous activity of the soul as fine\n(kalos) and excellent (spoudaios). Finally, the link\nbetween virtue and happiness is forged if a human sees that it is good\nto live a life that one considers to be fine and excellent.\n\n(For further detailed discussion, see entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s ethics.)\n\n5. Cynics\n\nAlthough the Cynics had an impact on moral thinking in Athens after\nthe death of Socrates, it is through later, and highly controversial,\nreports of their deeds and sayings \u2013 rather than their writings\n\u2013 that we know of them. Diogenes the Cynic, the central figure,\nis famous for living in a wine jar (Diogenes Laertius [= DL] VI 23)\nand going about with a lantern looking for \u2018a man\u2019 \u2013\ni.e., someone not corrupted (DL VI 41). He claimed to set courage over\nagainst fortune, nature against convention, and reason against passion\n(DL VI 38). Of this trio of opposites, the most characteristic for\nunderstanding the Cynics is nature against convention. Diogenes taught\nthat a life according to nature was better than one that conformed to\nconvention. First of all, natural life is simpler. Diogenes ate,\nslept, or conversed wherever it suited him and carried his food around\nwith him (DL VI 22). When he saw a child drinking out of its hand, he\nthrew away his cup, saying that a child had bested him in frugality\n(DL VI 37). He said the life of humans had been made easy by the gods\nbut that humans had lost sight of this through seeking after honeyed\ncakes, perfumes, and similar things (DL VI 44). With sufficient\ntraining the life according to nature is the happy life (DL VI\n71).\n\nAccordingly Diogenes became famous for behavior that flouted\nconvention (DL VI 69). Still, he thought that the simple life not only\nfreed one from unnecessary concerns but was essential to virtue.\nAlthough he says nothing specific about the virtues, he does commend\ntraining for virtuous behavior (DL VI 70). His frugality certainly\nbespeaks self-control. He condemned love of money, praised good men,\nand held love to be the occupation of the idle (DL VI\n50\u201351).\n\nBesides his contempt for convention, what is most noteworthy about\nDiogenes as a moral teacher is his emphasis on detachment from those\nthings most people consider good. In this emphasis, Diogenes seems to\nhave intensified a tendency found in Socrates. Certainly Socrates\ncould be heedless of convention and careless about providing for his\nbodily needs. To Plato, however, Diogenes seemed to be Socrates gone\nmad (DL VI 54). Still, in Diogenes\u2019 attitude, we can see at\nleast the beginning of the idea that the end of life is a\npsychological state marked by detachment. Counseling the simple and\nuncomplicated satisfaction of one\u2019s natural instincts and\ndesires, Diogenes urges detachment from those things held out by\nconvention to be good. While he is not so explicit, others develop the\ntheme of detachment into the notion of tranquility. The Stoics and\nEpicureans hold that happiness depends on detachment from vulnerable\nor difficult to obtain bodily and external goods and consists in a\npsychological state more under one\u2019s own direct control. In this\nway, happiness becomes associated (for the Epicureans) with\ntranquility (ataraxia). Finally, in Skepticism, suspension of\njudgment is a kind of epistemic detachment that provides tranquility.\nSo in Diogenes we find the beginnings of an idea that will become\ncentral to later ancient moral theory.\n6. Cyrenaics\n\nThe first of the Cyrenaic school was Aristippus, who came from Cyrene,\na Greek city on the north African coast. The account of his teachings,\nin Diogenes Laertius, can seem sometimes inconsistent. Nevertheless,\nAristippus is interesting because, as a thorough hedonist, he is\nsomething of a foil for Epicurus. First of all, pleasure is the end or\nthe goal of life \u2013 what everyone should seek in life. However,\nthe pleasure that is the end is not pleasure in general, or pleasure\nover the long term, but immediate, particular pleasures. Thus the end\nvaries situation by situation, action by action. The end is not\nhappiness because happiness is the sum of particular pleasures (DL II\n87\u201388). Accumulating the pleasures that produce happiness is\ntiresome (DL II 90). Particular pleasures are ones that are close-by\nor sure. Moreover, Aristippus said that pleasures do not differ from\none another, that one pleasure is not more pleasant than another. This\nsort of thinking would encourage one to choose a readily available\npleasure rather than wait for a \u201cbetter\u201d one in the\nfuture. This conclusion is reinforced by other parts of his teaching.\nHis school says that bodily pleasures are much better than mental\npleasures. While this claim would seem to contradict the idea that\npleasures do not differ, it does show preference for the immediately\nor easily available pleasures of bodily gratification over, e.g., the\nmental pleasure of a self-aware just person. In fact,\nAristippus\u2019 school holds that pleasure is good even if it comes\nfrom the most unseemly things (DL II 88). Aristippus, then, seems to\nhave raised improvidence to the level of a principle.\n\nStill, it is possible that the position is more than an elaborate\njustification for short-sighted pleasure-seeking. Cyrenaics taught\nthat a wise man (sophos) (one who always pursues immediate\ngratification) will in general live more pleasantly than a foolish\nman. That prudence or wisdom (phron\u00easis) is good, not\nin itself but in its consequences, suggests that some balance, perhaps\neven regarding others, is required in choosing pleasures (DL II 91).\nThe Cyrenaic attitude to punishment seems to be an example of\nprudence. They hold that nothing is just, fine, or base by nature but\nonly by convention and custom; still a good man will do nothing out of\nline through fear of punishment (DL II 93). Finally, they hold that\nfriendship is based in self-interest (DL II 91). These aspects of\nCyrenaic teaching suggest they are egoist hedonists. If so, there are\ngrounds for taking the interest of others into account as long as\ndoing so is based on what best provides an individual pleasure.\n\nNevertheless, Aristippus\u2019 school holds that the end of life is a\npsychological good, pleasure. Still, it is particular pleasures not\nthe accumulation of these that is the end. As a consequence, their\nmoral theory contrasts sharply with others in antiquity. If we take\nthe claims about the wise man, prudence, and friendship to be\nreferences to virtue, then Aristippus\u2019 school denies that virtue\nis indispensable for achieving the end or goal of life. While they\nhold that virtue is good insofar as it leads to the end, they seem\nprepared to dispense with virtue in circumstances where it proves\nineffective. Even if they held virtue in more esteem, the Cyrenaics\nwould nonetheless not be eudaimonists since they deny that happiness\nis the end of life.\n7. Epicurus\n\nEpicurean moral theory is the most prominent hedonistic theory in the\nancient world. While Epicurus holds that pleasure is the sole\nintrinsic good and pain is what is intrinsically bad for humans, he is\nalso very careful about defining these two. Aware of the Cyrenaics who\nhold that pleasures, moral and immoral, are the end or goal of all\naction, Epicurus presents a sustained argument that pleasure,\ncorrectly understood, will coincide with virtue.\n\nIn the Letter to Menoeceus, Epicurus begins by making a\ndistinction among desires. Some desires are empty or groundless and\nothers are natural; the natural are further subdivided into the merely\nnatural and the necessary. Finally, the necessary are those necessary\nfor happiness, those necessary for the body\u2019s freedom from\ndistress, and those necessary for life itself (Letter to\nMenoeceus 127). A helpful scholiast (cf. Principal\nDoctrines XXIX) gives us some examples; necessary desires are\nones that bring relief from unavoidable pain, such as drinking when\nthirsty \u2013 if we don\u2019t drink when we need replenishment, we\nwill just get thirstier and thirstier, a painful experience. The\nnatural but not necessary are the ones that vary pleasure but are not\nneeded in order to motivate us to remove or ward off pain,\nsuch as the desire for expensive food: we do not need to want, or to\neat, expensive food in order to ward off the pain of prolonged hunger.\nFinally, the groundless desires are for such things as crowns and\nstatues bestowed as civic honors \u2013 these are things that when\ndesired at all are desired with intense and harmful cravings. Keeping\nthese distinctions in mind is a great help in one\u2019s life because\nit shows us what we need to aim for. The aim of the blessed life is\nthe body\u2019s health and the soul\u2019s freedom from disturbance\n(ataraxia) (128).\n\nAfter this austere introduction, Epicurus makes the bold claim that\npleasure is the beginning and end of the blessed life. Then he makes\nan important qualification. Just because pleasure is the good,\nEpicureans do not seek every pleasure. Some lead to greater pain. Just\nso, they do not avoid all pains; some lead to greater pleasures\n(128\u201329). Such a position sounds, of course, like common-sense\nhedonism. If one\u2019s aim is to have as much pleasure as possible\nover the long term, it makes sense to avoid some smaller pleasures\nthat will be followed by larger pains. If one wants, for example, to\nhave as much pleasure from drinking wine as possible, then it would\nmake sense to exercise some judgment about how much to drink on an\noccasion since the next morning\u2019s hangover will be very\nunpleasant, and might keep one from having wine the next day. However,\nhis distinction among groundless, natural, and necessary desires\nshould make us suspicious that Epicurus is no common-sense hedonist.\nThe aim of life is not maximizing pleasures in the way the above\nexample suggests. Rather, real pleasure, the aim of life, is what we\nexperience through freedom from pain and distress. So it is not the\npains of the hangover or the possible loss of further bouts of wine\ndrinking that should restrain my drinking on this occasion. Rather one\nshould be aiming at the pleasure given by freedom from bodily pain and\nmental distress (131\u201332).\n\nThe usual way to understand the pleasure of freedom from pain and from\ndistress is by way of the distinction between kinetic pleasures and\nkatastematic, or what are, following Cicero, misleadingly called\n\u2018static\u2019 ones (Diogenes Laertius X 136). The name of the\nformer implies motion and the name of the latter implies a state or\ncondition. The reason the distinction is important is that freedom\nfrom pain and from distress is a state or condition, not a motion.\nEpicurus holds not only that this state is a kind of pleasure but that\nit is the most complete pleasure (Principal Doctrines III).\nModern commentators have taken various approaches to explaining why\nthis state should be considered a pleasure, as opposed to, e.g., the\nattitude of taking pleasure in the fact that one is free of pain and\ndistress. After all, taking pleasure in a fact is not a feeling in the\nsame sense as the pleasure of drinking when thirsty. Since the latter\nis usually taken to be an example of kinetic pleasure (and is\nassociated with the pain of thirst), sometimes katastematic pleasure\nis said to be just kinetic pleasure free from pain and distress, e.g.,\nthe pleasure of satiety. A somewhat broader conception of katastematic\npleasure holds that it is the enjoyment of one\u2019s natural\nconstitution when one is not distracted by bodily pain or mental\ndistress. Finally, some commentators hold the pleasure of freedom from\npain and from distress to be a feeling available only to the wise\nperson, who properly appreciates simple pleasures. Since eating plain\nbread and drinking water are usually not difficult to achieve, to the\nwise, their enjoyment is not overwhelmed by fear (130\u201331).\nAccordingly, the pleasure they take in these is free of pain and\ndistress. Of course, the wise do not have to confine themselves to\nsimple pleasures; they can enjoy luxurious ones as well \u2013 as\nlong as they avoid needing them, which entails fear.\n\nAt this point, we can see that Epicurus has so refined the account of\npleasure and pain that he is able to tie them to virtue. In the\nLetter to Menoeceus, he claims, as a truth for which he does\nnot argue, that virtue and pleasure are inseparable and that living a\nprudent, honorable, and just life is the necessary and sufficient\nmeans to the pleasure that is the end of life (132). An example of\nwhat he might mean is found in Principal Doctrines, where\nEpicurus holds that justice is a contract among humans to avoid\nsuffering harm from one another. Then he argues that injustice is not\nbad per se but is bad because of the fear that arises from\nthe expectation that one will be punished for his misdeeds. He\nreinforces this claim by arguing that it is impossible for someone who\nviolates the compact to be confident that he will escape detection\n(Principal Doctrines XXXIV\u2013V). While one might doubt\nthis claim about the malfactor\u2019s state of mind, nevertheless, we\ncan see that Epicurus means to ground justice, understood as the rules\ngoverning human intercourse, in his moral psychology, i.e., the need\nto avoid distress.\n\nEpicurus, like his predecessors in the ancient moral tradition,\nidentified the good as something psychological. However, instead of,\nfor example, the complex Aristotelian notion of excellent activity of\nthe soul, Epicurus settled on the fairly obvious psychological good of\npleasure. Of course, Aristotle argues that excellent activity of the\nsoul is intrinsically pleasurable (Nicomachean Ethics\n1099a5). Still, in his account pleasure seems something like a\ndividend of excellent activity (1175b30). By contrast, for Epicurus\npleasure itself is the end of life. However, since Epicureans hold\nfreedom from pain (aponia) and distress (ataraxia)\ngives the preferable pleasure, they emphasize tranquility\n(ataraxia) as the end of life. Modern utilitarians, for whom\nfreedom from pain and distress is not paramount, would include a\nbroader palate of pleasures.\n\nEpicurus\u2019 doctrine can be considered eudaimonist. While Plato\nand Aristotle maintain that virtue is constitutive of happiness,\nEpicurus holds that virtue is the only means to achieve happiness,\nwhere happiness is understood as a continuous experience of the\npleasure that comes from freedom from pain and from mental distress.\nThus, he is a eudaimonist in that he holds virtue is indispensable to\nhappiness; but he does not identify virtuous activity, in whole or in\npart, with happiness. Finally, Epicurus is usually interpreted to have\nheld a version of psychological hedonism \u2013 i.e., everything we\ndo is done for the sake of pleasure \u2013 rather than ethical\nhedonism \u2013 i.e., we ought to do everything for the sake of\npleasure. However, Principal Doctrine XXV suggests the latter\nposition; and when in the Letter to Menoeceus he says that\n\u201cwe\u201d do everything in order not to be in pain or in fear,\nhe might mean to be referring to \u201cwe\u201d Epicureans. If so,\nthe claim would be normative. Still, once all disturbance of the soul\nis dispelled, he says, one is no longer in need nor is there any other\ngood that could be added (128). Since this claim appears to be\ndescriptive, Epicurus could be taken, as he usually has been, to be\narguing that whatever we do is done for the sake of pleasure. In this\naccount, that aspect of human nature on which virtue is based is\nfairly straightforward. The account is certainly less complex than,\ne.g., Aristotle\u2019s. In turn, Epicurus seems to have argued in\nsuch a way as to make pleasure the only reason for being virtuous. If\npsychological hedonism is true, then when one realizes the necessary\nlink between virtue and pleasure, one has all the reason one needs to\nbe virtuous and the only reason one can have.\n8. Stoics\n\nThe Stoics are well known for their teaching that the good is to be\nidentified with virtue. Virtues include logic, physics, and ethics\n(Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta [=SVF]II 35), as well as wisdom,\nmoderation, justice, and courage. To our modern ears, the first three\nsound like academic subjects; but for the Stoics, they were virtues of\nthought. However, orthodox Stoics do not follow the Aristotelian\ndistinction between intellectual and moral virtues because \u2013 as\nwe shall see \u2013 they hold that all human psychological functions,\nincluding the affective and volitional, are rational in a single,\nunified sense. For them, consequently, all virtues form a unity around\nthe core concept of knowledge. Finally, all that is required for\nhappiness (i.e., the secure possession of the good, of what is needed\nto make one\u2019s life a thoroughly good one) \u2013 and the only\nthing \u2013 is to lead a virtuous life. In this teaching Stoics are\naddressing the problem of bodily and external goods raised by\nAristotle. Their solution takes the radical course of dismissing such\nalleged goods from the account of happiness because they are not\nnecessary for virtue, and are not, in fact, in any way good at\nall.\n\nThey argue that health, pleasure, beauty, strength, wealth, good\nreputation, and noble birth are neither good nor bad. Since they can\nbe used well or badly and the good is invariably good, these assets\nare not good. The virtues, however, are good (DL VII 102\u2013103),\nsince they are perfections of our rationality, and only rationally\nperfected thoughts and decisions can possibly have the features of\nharmony and order in which goodness itself consists. Since possessing\nand exercising virtue is happiness, happiness does not include such\nthings as health, pleasure, and wealth. Still, the Stoics do not\ndismiss these assets altogether since they still have a kind of value.\nThese things are indifferent to happiness in that they do not add to\none\u2019s virtue nor detract from it, and so they do not add to or\ntake away from one\u2019s possession of the good. One is not more\nvirtuous because healthy nor less virtuous because ill. But being\nhealthy generally conforms with nature\u2019s plans for the lives of\nanimals and plants, so it is preferable to be healthy, and one should\ntry to preserve and maintain one\u2019s health. Health is, then, the\nkind of value they call a preferred indifferent; but it is not in any\nway a good, and it makes no contribution to the quality of one\u2019s\nlife as a good or a bad one, happy or miserable.\n\nIn order to understand the Stoic claims about the relation of virtue\nto happiness, we can begin with virtue. Chrysippus says that virtue is\na craft (techn\u00ea) having to do with the things of life\n(SVF II 909). In other texts, we learn that the things of\nlife include impulse (horm\u00ea). Each animal has an\nimpulse for self-preservation; it has an awareness of its constitution\nand strives to preserve its integrity. There is also a natural impulse\nto care for offspring. Humans, then, are naturally inclined toward\npreserving life, health, and children. But then grown-up humans also\ndo these things under the guidance of reason; reason in the adult\nhuman case is the craftsman of impulse (DL VII 85\u20136). This\nlatter phrase is significant because it implies that just following\nnatural impulse is not enough. In fact, it is not even possible for an\nadult human, whose nature is such as to do everything they do\nby reason, even to follow the sort of natural impulses that\nanimals and immature humans do in their actions. In order to lead a\nvirtuous life, reason must shape our impulses and guide their\nexpression in action.\n\nImpulse is the key to understanding the relation between virtue and\nhappiness. An impulse is a propositional attitude that, when assented\nto, leads to action, e.g., \u2018I should eat this bread now.\u2019\nHowever, impulses do not arise in a separate, non-rational part of the\nsoul. Stoics deny there are any non-rational desires of appetite\ncapable of impelling action. The soul, insofar as it provides\nmotivations and is the cause of our actions, consists of the\ncommanding faculty (h\u00eagemonikon) which is also reason\n(SVF I 202). We can distinguish correct impulses into those\nwhich treat virtue as the only good and those which treat things\nindifferent as indifferent. By contrast, emotions or passions (\npath\u00ea) are incorrect impulses that treat what is\nindifferent as good. However, they do not come from a non-rational\npart of the soul but are false judgments about the good, where\njudgment is understood as assent to some impulse. Emotions, such as\ndesire, fear, pleasure, and pain, embody such erroneous judgments\n(SVF III 391, 393, 394). For instance, the desire for health\narises from assenting to the impulse that embodies the false judgment\nthat health is good, instead of a preferred indifferent. The sage\n\u2013 someone perfected in virtue \u2013 would never assent to such\nfalse propositions and thus would never have emotions in this sense,\nno feelings that carried him beyond reason\u2019s true assessment. He\nwould, however, experience feelings attuned to reason,  eupatheiai\n \u2013literally good emotions or feelings. For instance, he\nwould feel joy over his virtue, but not pleasure \u2013 the latter\nbeing an emotion that treats the actual possession of an indifferent\nas a good.\n\nKnowledge, then, about what is good, bad, and indifferent is the heart\nof virtue. Courage, e.g., is simply knowledge of what is to be\nendured: the impulse to endure or not, and the only impulse\nthat is needed by courage, then follows automatically, as a product or\naspect of that knowledge. This tight unity in the soul is the basis\nfor the Stoic teaching about the unity of the virtues. Zeno (the\nfounder of the school) defines wisdom (phron\u00easis), or\nrather practical knowledge, in matters requiring distribution\nas justice, in matters requiring choice as moderation, and in matters\nrequiring endurance as courage (Plutarch On Moral Virtue\n440E\u2013441D). Practical knowledge, then, is a single,\ncomprehensive knowledge of what is good and bad in each of these kinds\nof circumstance.\n\nAttending to this identification of virtue and practical knowledge is\na good way to understand the central Stoic teaching that virtue is\nliving in agreement with nature (SVF III 16). Nature includes\nnot only what produces natural impulses but also the rest of the\ngovernment of the cosmos, the natural world. The universe is governed\nby right reason that pervades everything and directs (causes) the way\nit functions \u2013 with the exception of the only rational animals\nthere are, the adult human beings: their actions are governed by\nthemselves, i.e., by assenting to, or withholding assent from\nparticular impulses. Nature is even identified with Zeus, who is said\nto be the director of the administration of all that exists (DL VII\n87\u20139). Since reason governs the universe for the good,\neverything happens of necessity and for the overall good. Virtue,\nthen, includes understanding both one\u2019s individual nature as a\nhuman being and the way nature arranges the whole universe. At this\npoint, we can appreciate the role of logic and physics as virtue since\nthese entail knowledge of the universe. This understanding is the\nbasis for living in agreement with the government of the universe,\ni.e., with nature, by making one\u2019s decisions and actions be such\nas to agree with Zeus\u2019s or nature\u2019s own plans, so far as\none can understand what those are.\n\nIt is in this context that we can best understand the Stoic teaching\nabout indifferents, such as health and wealth. An individual\u2019s\nhealth is vulnerable to being lost if right reason that governs the\nuniverse requires it for the good of the whole. If happiness depended\non having these assets and avoiding their opposites, then, in these\ncases, happiness would be impossible. However, if virtue is living in\nagreement with nature\u2019s government of the universe and if virtue\nis the only good, one\u2019s happiness is entirely determined by his\npatterns of assent and is therefore not vulnerable to being lost. If\none understands that the good of the whole dictates that in a\nparticular case one\u2019s health must be sacrificed, then one\nrecognizes that his happiness does not require health. We should not,\nhowever, see this recognition as tantamount to renunciation. If the\nStoic notion of happiness has any relation at all to the ordinary\nsense, renunciation cannot be a part of it. Rather, the Stoic view of\nliving in accordance with nature should imply not only understanding\nthe way right reason rules the universe but agreeing with it and even\ndesiring that things happen as they do. We can best appreciate the\nnotion that virtue is the good, then, if we take virtue as both\nacknowledging that the universe is well governed and adopting the\npoint of view, so to speak, of the government (DL VII 87\u20139).\n\nA refinement of the Stoic approach to indifferents gives us a way of\nunderstanding what living in agreement with nature might look like.\nAfter all, such things as health and wealth cannot just be dismissed\nsince they are something like the raw material of virtue. It is in\npursuing and using them that one exercises virtue, for instance. In\nthe attempt to integrate preferred indifferents into the pursuit of\nthe good, Stoics used an analogy with archery (On Ends\nIII.22). Since he aims to hit the target, the archer does everything\nin his power to hit the target. Trying everything in his power\nreflects the idea that such factors as a gust of wind \u2013 chance\nhappenings that cannot be controlled or foreseen \u2013 can intervene\nand keep him from achieving the goal. To account for this type of\nfactor, it is claimed that the goal of the archer is really trying\neverything in his power to attain the end. The analogy with the art of\nliving focuses on this shift from the goal of hitting the target to\nthe goal of trying everything in one\u2019s power to hit the target\n(On Ends V.17\u201320). It is the art of trying everything\nin one\u2019s power to attain such preferred indifferents as health\nand wealth. However, if right reason, which governs the universe,\ndecides that one will not have either, then the sage follows right\nreason. At this point the analogy with archery breaks down since, for\nthe sage, trying everything in one\u2019s power does not mean\nstriving until one fails; rather, it means seeking preferred\nindifferents guided by right reason. By this reasoning, one should see\nthat virtue and happiness are not identified with achieving heath and\nwealth but with the way one seeks them and the evaluative propositions\none assents to. Finally, the art of living is best compared to such\nskills as acting and dancing (On Ends V. 24\u20135).\n\nThis way of relating preferred indifferents to the end, i.e., to\nhappiness, was challenged in antiquity as incoherent. Plutarch, for\ninstance, argues that it is contrary to common understanding to say\nthat the end is different from the reference point of all action. If\nthe reference point of all action \u2013 what one does everything to\nachieve \u2013 is to have preferred indifferents such as health, then\nthe end is to have preferred indifferents. However, if the end is not\nto have preferred indifferents (but, say, always to act prudently),\nthen the reference point of all action cannot be the preferred\nindifferents (On Common Conceptions 1070F\u20131071E). The\nStoics are presented with a dilemma: either preferred indifferents are\nintegral to the end or they are not the object of choice.\n\nThe Stoics are extreme eudaimonists compared to Plato or Aristotle,\nalthough they are clearly inspired by Socratic intellectualism. While\nPlato clearly associates virtue and happiness, he never squarely faces\nthe issue whether happiness may require other goods, e.g., wealth and\nhealth. Aristotle holds happiness to be virtuous activity of the soul;\nbut he raises \u2013 without solving \u2013 the problem of bodily\nand external goods and happiness. For these two, virtue, together with\nits active exercise, is the dominant and most important component of\nhappiness, while Stoics simply identify virtue and the good, and so\nmake it the only thing needed for a happy life. Still, Stoics do not\nreduce happiness to virtue, as though \u2018happiness\u2019 is just\na name for being perfectly just, courageous, and moderate. Rather they\nhave independent ways of describing happiness. Following Zeno, all the\nStoics say it is a good flow of life. Seneca says the happy life is\npeacefulness and constant tranquility. However, we should keep in mind\nthat, while they do not reduce happiness to virtue, their account of\nhappiness is not that of the common person. So in recommending virtue\nbecause it secures happiness the Stoics are relying on happiness in a\nspecial, although not idiosyncratic, sense. In fact, their idea of\nhappiness shares an important feature with the Epicurean, which puts a\npremium on tranquil pleasures. In Stoicism as well, deliverance from\nthe vicissitudes of fate leads to a notion of happiness that\nemphasizes tranquility. And, as we shall see, tranquility is a value\nfor the Skeptics.\n\nClearly, the Stoic account of virtue and happiness depends on their\ntheory about human nature. For Aristotle, virtue is perfection of the\nhuman function and the Stoics follow in this line of thinking. While\ntheir notion of virtue builds on their notion of the underlying human\nnature, their account of the perfection of human nature is more\ncomplex than Aristotle\u2019s. It includes accommodation to the\nnature of the universe. Virtue is the perfection of human nature that\nmakes it harmonious with the workings of fate, i.e. with Zeus\u2019s\noverall plan, regarded as the ineluctable, though providential, cause\nof what happens in the world at large.\n9. Pyrrhonian Skeptics\n\nPyrrho, a murky figure, roughly contemporary with Epicurus and Zeno\nthe Stoic, left no writings. In the late, anecdotal tradition he is\ncredited with introducing suspension of judgment (DL IX 61). He became\nthe eponymous hero for the founding of Pyrrhonian skepticism in the\nfirst century B.C. (See entry on\n Pyrrho\n and on\n Ancient Skepticism.)\n Having discovered that for every argument examined so far there is an\nopposing argument, Pyrrhonian Skeptics expressed no determinate\nopinions (DL IX 74). This attitude would seem to lead to a kind of\nepistemic paralysis. The Skeptics reply that they do not abolish,\ne.g., relying on sight. They do not say that it is unreliable and they\ndo not refuse, personally, ever to rely on it. Rather, they have the\nimpression that there is no reason why we are entitled to rely on it,\nin a given case or in general, even if we go ahead and rely on it\nanyhow (DL IX 103). For example, if one has the visual impression of a\ntower, that appearance is not in dispute. What is in dispute is\nwhether the tower is as it appears to be. For Skeptics, claiming that\nthe tower is as it appears to be is a dogmatic statement about the\nobject or the causal history of the appearance. As far as the Skeptic\nis concerned, all such statements have failed to be adequately\njustified, and all supporting arguments can be opposed by equally\nconvincing counter-arguments. Lacking any grounds on which to prefer\none dogmatic statement or view over another, he suspends judgment.\n\nSuch views have an obvious impact on practical and moral issues. First\nof all, the Skeptics argue that, so far as we have been given any\ncompelling reason by philosophers to believe, there is nothing good or\nbad by nature (Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism\n[=PH] III 179\u2013238, Adversus Mathematicos\n[=M] XI 42\u2013109). And just in case he does find such\nreasons compelling, the Skeptic will resist the temptation to assent\nby posing a general counter-argument: what is good by nature would be\nrecognized by everyone, but clearly not everyone agrees \u2013 for\ninstance, Epicurus holds that pleasure is good by nature but\nAntisthenes holds that it is not (DL IX 101) \u2013 hence there is\nnothing good by nature (see section 4 of the entry on\n Moral Skepticism).\n The practical consequences of suspending judgment are illustrated by\ntwo traditions about the life of Pyrrho. In one, Pyrrho himself did\nnot avoid anything, whether it was wagons, precipices, or dogs. It\nwould appear that, suspending judgment about whether being hit by a\nwagon was naturally good or bad, Pyrrho might walk into its path, or\nnot bother to get out of the way. His less skeptical friends kept him\nalive \u2013 presumably by guiding him away from busy roads, vicious\ndogs, and deep gorges. Another tradition, however, says that he only\ntheorized about suspension of judgments, and took action to preserve\nhimself and otherwise lead a normal life, but doing so without any\njudgments as to natural good and bad. Living providently, he reached\nninety years of age (DL IX 62).\n\nIn any event, Pyrrho\u2019s suspension of judgment led to a certain\ndetachment. Not knowing what was good or bad by nature, he was\nindifferent where dogmatists would be unhappy or at least anxious. For\ninstance, he performed household chores usually done by women (DL IX\n63\u201366). Thus Pyrrho\u2019s skepticism detached him from the\ndogmatic judgments of a culture in which a man\u2019s performing\nwomen\u2019s work was considered demeaning. In turn, his skepticism\nand suspension of judgment led to freedom from disturbance\n(ataraxia) (DL IX 68). It is significant that this\npsychological state, so important for Epicureans as part of the end of\nlife, should play a key role in Pyrrhonian skepticism at its beginning\nwith Pyrrho, but certainly in its development with Sextus\nEmpiricus.\n\nWhile suspension of judgment in moral matters brings freedom from\ndisturbance, it does not lead to immoral behavior \u2013 anymore than\nit leads to the foolhardy behavior of the first tradition about\nPyrrho\u2019s life. Sextus generalizes the Skeptic teaching about\nappearances to cover the whole area of practical activity. He says the\nrules of everyday conduct are divided into four parts: (1) the\nguidance from nature, (2) compulsion that comes from bodily states\nlike hunger and thirst, (3) traditional laws and customs about pious\nand good living, (4) the teachings of the crafts (PH, I\n21\u201324). The Skeptic is guided by all of these as by appearance,\nand thus undogmatically. For instance, he would follow the traditional\nlaws about pious and good living, accepting these laws as the way\nthings appear to him to be in matters of piety and goodness but\nclaiming no knowledge and holding no beliefs.\n\nSextus says that the end of life is freedom from disturbance in\nmatters of belief, plus moderate states in matters of compulsion.\nSuspension of judgment provides the former in that one is not\ndisturbed about which of two opposing claims is true, when (as always\nseems to happen) one cannot rationally decide between them. Matters of\ncompulsion cover such things as bodily needs for food, drink, and\nwarmth. While the Skeptic undeniably suffers when hungry, thirsty, or\ncold, he achieves a moderate state with respect to these sufferings\nwhen compared to the person who both suffers them and believes they\nare naturally bad. The Skeptic\u2019s suspension of judgment about\nwhether his suffering is naturally bad gives him a certain detachment\nfrom the suffering, and puts him in a better condition than those who\nalso believe their suffering is naturally bad (PH I\n25\u201330).\n\nAs a consequence, the Skeptic conception of the end of life is similar\nin some ways to Epicurean and Stoic beliefs. For Epicureans the end is\nfreedom from pain and distress; the Stoic identification of virtue and\nthe good promises freedom from disturbance. While Pyrrho and Sextus\nhold freedom from disturbance to be the end of life, they differ from\nthe former over the means by which it is achieved. Both the Epicureans\nand Stoics, for example, hold that a tranquil life is impossible in\nthe absence of virtue. By contrast, Sextus does not have a lot to say\nin a positive vein about virtue, although he does recommend following\ntraditional laws about piety and goodness, and he indicates that the\nSkeptic may live virtuously (PH I 17). Rather, it is for the\nSkeptics an epistemic attitude embodied in a distinctive practice, not\nvirtue, that leads to the desired state. This alone would seem to be\nenough to disqualify Pyrrhonism as a form of eudaimonism.\n\nSextus does however offer his skeptical practice as a corrective to\nthe dogmatists\u2019 misleading path to eudaimonia: it is\nnot possible to be happy while supposing things are good or bad by\nnature (M XI 130, 144). It is the person who suspends\njudgment that enjoys the most complete happiness (M XI 160,\n140). It is important to observe that Sextus proposes his skeptical\npractice as an alternative to dogmatic theories. For\nthe Skeptic makes no commitments, or even assertions, regarding the\nsupposedly objective conditions that are supposed by other\nphilosophers to underlie our natural, human telos.\nAccordingly, some have objected that the kind of tranquility and\nhappiness that the Skeptic enjoys could just as well be produced\nthrough pharmacology or, we might add, Experience Machines. More\ngenerally speaking, the objection is that skeptical tranquility and\nhappiness comes at a cost we should not be willing to pay. By refusing\nto accept the world is ever as it appears, the Skeptic becomes a\ndetached, passive spectator, undisturbed by any of the thoughts that\npass through his mind. Such detachment might seem to threaten his\nability to care about other people as he observes all that happens to\nthem with the same tranquil indifference. Also, he would seem to be at\nbest a moral conformist, unable or at least unwilling to engage in any\nmoral deliberation, either hypothetically or as a means to directly\naddress a pressing moral issue.\n\nSextus provides an example of the latter situation when he imagines\nthe Skeptic being compelled by a tyrant to commit some unspeakable\ndeed, or be tortured (M XI 164\u201366). Critics propose\nthat the Skeptic\u2019s choice will necessarily reveal his evaluative\nconvictions, and thus his inconsistency in claiming to have no such\nconvictions. But Sextus replies that he will simply opt for one or the\nother in accordance with his family\u2019s laws and customs. In other\nwords, he will rely on whatever moral sentiments and dispositions he\nhappens to have. These cognitive states will be neither the product of\nany rational consideration nor will they inform any premises for moral\nreasoning or philosophical deliberation. Like Sartre\u2019s\nexistentialism, Sextus\u2019 skepticism offers a way to respond to\nmoral dilemmas without supposing there is a correct, or even\nobjectively better, choice.\n\nWe should note that it is not entirely fair to ask whether the\nPyrrhonist\u2019s moral life is one that we, non-Skeptics, would deem\ngood or praise-worthy. For, as Sextus would say, we are part of the\ndispute regarding what kind of life is morally good and praise-worthy.\nTo claim that nothing really matters to the Skeptic, for example,\npresupposes some account of the mental state of caring. In the end,\nthe question of how or whether a Skeptic might be morally good is\nequivalent to asking what role belief, or knowledge, plays in the\nmoral goodness of people and their actions. If we suppose that one\nmust, at a minimum, have adequately justified evaluative beliefs\ninforming her actions in order for those actions, and the underlying\ncharacter, to count as morally good, then the Skeptic will be immoral,\nor at least amoral. On the other hand, if the Skeptic manages to\nundermine our confidence in that supposition, we will have to suspend\njudgment regarding whether the Skeptic, or anyone else for that\nmatter, is in fact capable of performing morally good and\npraise-worthy action, or whether their reasoned account of\neudaimonia is true.\n\nThe question we should ask here is whether and in what respect those\nwith strong, rational convictions will be better off than the Skeptic\nwhen confronting moral dilemmas, or even everyday moral choices. If,\nlike the Skeptic, one suspects that the dogmatists\u2019 have no\nknowledge, let alone adequately justified beliefs to guide them, then\nit seems that they are no better or worse off than those who simply\nconform to moral customs and norms.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Arnim, Joachim von (ed.), <em>Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta</em>,\nVolumes I\u2013IV, Leipzig: B.G.
