    "main_text": "CA and Philosophy || CA as Models of Reality\n4. Concluding Remarks\n\nAlthough some CA topics are still relatively untouched by philosophers\n(e.g., the nature of space and time (see Wolfram 2002: 481\u2013496),\nthe representation of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence (see Berto,\nRossi, Tagliabue: 15\u201326), the relationship between information\nand energy (see Fredkin & Toffoli 1982)), there are many\nconceptual challenges raised in connection with CA. While in some\ncases the CA contribution was indeed overrated by practitioners, in\nothers CA proved to be useful models of important phenomena.\n\nAs a final comment: what is left, from a purely scientific\nperspective, of the NKS Argument? Let us go through it\nagain:\n\n(NKS1)\n The observation of CA evolution leads to a scientific discovery:\n\u201cvery simple rules produce highly complex behavior\u201d\n(Wolfram 2002: 39).\n(NKS2)\n This discovery\u2014the \u201cnew\nintuition\u201d\u2014promises to explain old and new phenomena and\nuncover important regularities.\n(NKS3)\n Therefore, the core of our current scientific practices (based on\nthe \u201cold intuition\u201d) should be radically changed to\naccommodate this discovery.\n\n\nEven granting the truth of the two premises (that is, even granting\nthe troublesome Principle of Computational Equivalence), it is\ndoubtful the desired conclusion would follow. Surely, CA have provided\nnew intuitions and explanations for a set of phenomena\u2014Wolfram\nquite successfully applies his \u201cdiscovery\u201d to biology,\ncomputer science, physics, finance. However, there is no evidence that\nmany of our best scientific explanations will soon be reduced to the\nCA framework, and indeed many aspects of complexity itself still lie\noutside the CA paradigm, with no unification in sight. Paradigm shifts\nusually require the new paradigm to explain the same phenomena the old\none did, and some more. CA are a promising field, but many\ndevelopments are still needed for\n (NKS3)\n to be true.\n",
