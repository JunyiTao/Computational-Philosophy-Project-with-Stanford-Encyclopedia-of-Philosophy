    "main_text": "The Nature of Friendship || Mutual Caring\n1.1 Mutual Caring\n\nA necessary condition of friendship, according to just about every\nview (Telfer 1970\u201371; Annas 1988, 1977; Annis 1987; Badhwar\n1987; Millgram 1987; Sherman 1987; Thomas 1987, 1989, 1993; Friedman\n1993, 1989; Whiting 1991; Hoffman 1997; Cocking & Kennett 1998;\nand White 1999a, 1999b, 2001) is that the friends each care about the\nother, and do so for her sake; in effect, this is to say that the\nfriends must each love the other. Although many accounts of friendship\ndo not analyze such mutual caring any further, among those that do\nthere is considerable variability as to how we should understand the\nkind of caring involved in friendship. Nonetheless, there is\nwidespread agreement that caring about someone for his sake involves\nboth sympathy and action on the friend\u2019s behalf. That is,\nfriends must be moved by what happens to their friends to feel the\nappropriate emotions: joy in their friends\u2019 successes,\nfrustration and disappointment in their friends\u2019 failures (as\nopposed to disappointment in the friends themselves), etc. Moreover,\nin part as an expression of their caring for each other, friends must\nnormally be disposed to promote the other\u2019s good for her sake\nand not out of any ulterior motive. (However, see Velleman 1999 for a\ndissenting view.)\n\nTo care about something is generally to find it worthwhile or valuable\nin some way; caring about one\u2019s friend is no exception. A\ncentral difference among the various accounts of mutual caring is the\nway in which these accounts understand the kind of evaluation implicit\ntherein. Most accounts understand that evaluation to be a matter of\nappraisal: we care about our friends at least in part because of the\ngood qualities of their characters that we discover them to have\n(Annas 1977; Sherman 1987; Whiting 1991); this is in line with the\nunderstanding of love as philia or eros given in the\nfirst paragraph of Section 1 above. For this reason, many authors\nargue that to be friends with bad people reveals a potentially morally\ncondemnable\u00a0evaluative defect (see, e.g., Isserow 2018). Other\naccounts, however, understand caring as in part a matter of bestowing\nvalue on your beloved: in caring about a friend, we thereby project a\nkind of intrinsic value onto him; this is in line with the\nunderstanding of love as agape given above.\n\nFriedman (1989, 6) argues for bestowal, saying that if we were to base\nour friendship on positive appraisals of our friend\u2019s\nexcellences, \u201cto that extent our commitment to that\nperson is subordinate to our commitment to the relevant [evaluative]\nstandards and is not intrinsically a commitment to that person.\u201d\nHowever, this is too quick, for to appeal to an appraisal of the good\nqualities of your friend\u2019s character in order to justify your\nfriendship is not on its own to subordinate your friendship to that\nappraisal. Rather, through the friendship, and through changes in your\nfriend over time, you may come to change your evaluative outlook,\nthereby in effect subordinating your commitment to certain values to\nyour commitment to your friend. Of course, within friendship the\ninfluence need not go only one direction: friends influence each\nother\u2019s conceptions of value and how to live. Indeed, that\nfriends have a reciprocal effect on each other is a part of the\nconcern for equality many find essential to friendship, and it is\ncentral to the discussion of intimacy in\n Section 1.2.\n\n(For more on the notion of caring about another for her sake and the\nvariety of philosophical accounts of it, see the entry on\n love.)\n",
