Motivated by\nthe political project of eliminating the oppression of women, feminist\nepistemologists are interested in how the norms and practices of\nknowledge production affect the lives of women and are implicated in\nsystems of oppression. Feminist epistemologists seek to understand not\nonly how our social relations of gender have shaped our\nknowledge practices, but also whether and how these relations\nshould play a role in good knowing. Feminists have\ndistinguished between the categories of gender and (anatomical) sex,\nand for decades have focused much of their attention on gender, the analytical\ncategory capturing the cultural and social aspects of sexed\n bodies.[1]\nAs a category of social relations then, gender is a significant area\nof investigation for social epistemology. Additionally, feminist\nepistemologists have increasingly attended to the interrelations\nbetween gender and other social categories such as race and ethnicity,\nclass, sexuality, ability status, and global location, investigating\ntheir significance for knowledge.\n\n\nElizabeth Anderson characterizes feminist epistemology as properly\nbelonging within social epistemology, describing it as \u201cthe branch of\nsocial epistemology that investigates the influence of socially\nconstructed conceptions and norms of gender and gender-specific\ninterests and experiences on the production of knowledge\u201d(1995a,\n54). It may be too strong a claim to suggest that all projects of\nfeminist epistemology fall within the realm of social epistemology; it\ncould be argued that some projects of feminist epistemology, such as\nLouise Antony\u2019s defense of epistemological individualism (1995),\nresist at least certain elements of a social epistemology. Similarly,\ntheorists who argue that there are epistemically valuable feminine\nways of knowing integral to women, without providing a social\nanalysis, could also be viewed as resisting certain elements of a\nsocial epistemology.[2]\n Nevertheless, by far the majority of work in feminist epistemology is\nbest understood as a form of social epistemology.\n\n\nFeminist social epistemology represents more than just a small subset\nof social epistemology, however. The significant body of work of\nfeminist social epistemologists has provided key theoretical resources\nfor understanding the breadth and depth of the social dimensions of\nknowing. The interest of feminist social epistemologists in how gender\nplays out in knowledge practices is generalizable to an interest in\nhow power relations play out epistemically, especially systematic\nrelations of power. Their focus on power relations has led some to\ncharacterize feminist social epistemologists as falling on the radical\nend of the social epistemology spectrum (Goldman 2001; Kitcher\n1994). Radical or not, few feminist epistemologists reduce knowledge\nto power politics, even as they draw attention to them. One of the key\nfeatures of feminist epistemologies responsible for some of their\nsignificant contributions within social epistemology has been their\nserious commitment to developing normative epistemological\naccounts. \n\n\nSocial epistemology distinguishes itself from sociology of knowledge\nin its goal of providing a normative analysis of knowledge (Fuller\n1988; Schmitt 1994a), seeking not only to describe our current social\npractices of knowledge production, but also to understand how we ought\nto know and how we can improve our knowledge practices. There is\nlittle agreement among social epistemologists on the scope or form of\nsuch normativity. However, feminist social epistemologists have felt\nthis need to incorporate a normative dimension to their social\nanalyses in a particularly pressing way: feminist political demands\nfor the elimination of oppression are normative in a moral sense, but\nthey also depend on epistemically normative claims for their\njustification. Their force depends on the ability to distinguish\nbetween better and worse claims to knowledge, for example by\ncriticizing sexist knowledge claims and supporting non-sexist\nknowledge claims. Feminists can ill afford to simply describe the ways\nin which social relations such as gender currently shape knowledge\npractices if they are to defend their claims for social change. Thus,\nfeminist social epistemologists have a particularly strong motivation\nto develop rich accounts that tease epistemic normativity out of a\npower-sensitive social understanding of knowledge production.\n\n\nAs is true of social epistemology as a whole, there is a great deal of\nvariation in the theories and approaches constituting feminist\nepistemology and few generalizations can be made across the field.\nAcknowledging such variety, some theorists refer only to \u201cfeminist\nepistemologies\u201d in the plural, fearing that characterizing a single\nfield of feminist epistemology implies a greater unity than exists.\nOthers have argued that feminist epistemology should best be\nidentified not by its specific theoretical content, but rather by what\n\u201cdoing epistemology as a feminist\u201d amounts to (Longino 1999). Doing\nepistemology as a feminist involves bringing one\u2019s feminist concerns\nand sensibilities to the epistemological table. As a result of\nbringing such concerns to epistemological work, significant feminist\ncontributions to social epistemology have included extensive critiques\nof the individualism of contemporary analytic epistemology, the\ndevelopment of alternative models of knowers as social beings,\ndefenses of the appropriate role of values and other culturally\nrelative factors in knowing, the development of socially informed\nconceptions of objectivity, analyses of the challenges of knowing\nunder social conditions of oppression, and analyses of the epistemic\nbenefits of social justice and democratic institutions.\n\n", "toc": [{"#HisDev": "1.

Historical Development\n\n\nAs the second wave of feminism progressed throughout the 1970s,\nfeminist philosophical work began to appear, first in ethics and\npolitical philosophy. At the same time, feminists working in other\ndisciplines such as the social sciences were documenting the sexism and\nandrocentrism in their fields. These theorists increasingly found the\nmethodologies of their disciplines incapable of accounting for their\nfeminist insights. Their interests turned to epistemological issues\nwhen it became apparent that alternative accounts of knowledge and of\njustification were required \u201cin order to overthrow presuppositions in\ntheir disciplines which functioned as obstacles to necessary change\u201d\n(Longino 1999, 330).\n\n\nTwo of the earliest pieces clearly identifiable as feminist\nepistemology were Lorraine Code\u2019s \u201cIs the Sex of the Knower\nEpistemically Significant?\u201d appearing in 1981 in\nMetaphilosophy and Sandra Harding\u2019s \u201cIs Gender a\nVariable in Conceptions of Rationality: A Survey of Issues\u201d\nappearing in 1982 in Dialectica. The first significant\ncollection of articles in feminist epistemology appeared in 1983 with\nSandra Harding and Merrill Hintikka\u2019s\nDiscovering Reality: Feminist Perspectives on Epistemology,\nMetaphysics, Methodology and Philosophy of Science. Soon after\nthe Harding and Hintikka volume, rates of publication in feminist\nepistemology picked up significantly. By contrast, although there are\nclear historical roots to the current form of the field (Goldman\n2001), social epistemology didn\u2019t make its presence felt on the\nterrain of contemporary epistemology until the late 1980s and early\n1990s. Steve Fuller\u2019s book Social Epistemology appeared in\n1988 and in 1994 Schmitt\u2019s volume Socializing Epistemology\nappeared, the first significant collection of work in contemporary\nsocial epistemology (1994b). Though few articles in this collection\nmake specific reference to feminist\n epistemology,[3]\n in his introduction Schmitt acknowledges feminist philosophers of\nscience, along with sociology of science, and naturalistic\nepistemology as the major inspirations for social epistemology since\n1980 (Schmitt 1994a, 3\u20134).\n\n\nThe Harding and Hintikka volume represented several angles of\nresearch, and set the stage for future discussions within feminist\nepistemology. Several pieces undertook deconstructive projects,\ndemonstrating how masculinist perspectives and assumptions infiltrate\nthe philosophies of particular historical figures. Other selections\nfocused on science studies, offering illustrations of the congruence\nbetween specific scientific theories and the social and political\nideologies of the day, including patriarchal ideologies. Still others\nrepresented reconstructive epistemological projects in response to\nsuch findings, arguing for a requisite role of values in scientific\ntheorizing, or arguing that rational investigation requires a critical\nassessment of the metaphysical (and sometimes gendered) assumptions\nunderlying a field of study. Additionally, Nancy Hartsock\u2019s\ncontribution to the volume outlined her version of feminist standpoint\ntheory, invoking the Marxist idea that social position is inversely\nrelated to epistemic\n position.[4]\n Standpoint theory offered an extensive argument for the grounding of\nepistemic perspective in one\u2019s social position, and would soon form\none of the most fruitful and heavily debated areas of theorizing for\nfeminist epistemologists.\n\n\nAs feminists turned to the reconstructive projects of developing new\nepistemologies, one of their major tasks was to explain the connection\nbetween the rise of the feminist movement and the recognition of sexism\nand androcentrism in what had previously been taken to be excellent\ncases of objective knowledge production. Why was it only with the rise\nof the feminist movement that critiques of the role of gendered\nassumptions in canonical figures such as Aristotle and Descartes began\nto appear? Why did primatology begin to question research based on male\ndominance schemas and begin to develop alternative models involving\ncloser observation of female primate behavior at the same time that there\nwas an increase in the number of women in the field? Why did it take feminist\npsychologists to point out the androcentrism involved in drawing\nconclusions about human beings based on all-male studies? In her\ncontribution to the Discovering Reality volume, Sandra Harding\nphrased the question as \u201cWhy has the Sex/Gender System Become Visible\nOnly Now?\u201d To answer it, feminists very clearly needed to develop\nsocial epistemologies. They needed to show not only how\nfeminist interests might motivate such knowledge production, but also\nhow such feminist motivated work could offer what many (feminists and\nnonfeminists alike) considered improved knowledge production, not just\nalternative knowledge production.\n\n\nHarding\u2019s 1986 book The Science Question in Feminism examined\nvarious epistemological options for feminists seeking to explain such\npolitical-epistemic connections within science. She set out what was\nto become a classic tripartite taxonomy of feminist epistemologies:\nfeminist empiricism, feminist standpoint theory and feminist\npostmodernism. Harding characterized feminist empiricism as arguing\nthat the sexist and androcentric biases present in science are the\nresult of \u201cbad\u201d science and can be corrected by stricter adherence to\ntraditional norms of science, as represented by the feminist critiques\nidentifying such biases (for example Bleier 1984; Hubbard 1983;\nLongino and Doell 1983). Feminist standpoint theory, according to\nHarding, argues that the political engagement of feminists and their\ncorresponding focus on the lives of women leads to an epistemically\nprivileged \u201cstandpoint\u201d on social reality (for example Hartsock 1983;\nRose 1983; Smith 1974), with the political engagement requirement\ndistinguishing the idea of a standpoint from the more generic idea of\na \u201cperspective\u201d. In contrast, feminist postmodernism, skeptical of\nuniversal claims of reason and the progress of science, argues that\nonly political solidarity across social locations can ground feminist\nfindings, there being no independent epistemological groundings (for\nexample Flax 1990; Haraway 1991).\n\n\nFeminist epistemologies continued to multiply throughout the 1980s and\nearly 1990s, quickly cross-fertilizing and in the process undermining\nHarding\u2019s classification system. Few current works in feminist\nepistemology fall unequivocally into a single category given\nHarding\u2019s three original definitions. For example, the leading\ntheories of feminist empiricism from the 1990s on have very little in\ncommon with Harding\u2019s characterization of feminist empiricism, given\nthat they do not explain past instances of sexism and androcentrism as\nsimply \u201cbad science\u201d and they do not accept traditional norms of\nscience as appropriate\n correctives (Longino 1990, 2002; Nelson 1990,\n 1993).[5]\n Even Harding has developed her own position as a blend of standpoint\ntheory and feminist postmodernism (Harding 1991). In spite of their\nsignificant limitations, however, Harding\u2019s divisions are still often\ncited, and remain useful in characterizing some of the main directions\nof the literature.\n\n\nMuch of the early work in feminist social epistemology was highly\ncritical of many mainstream epistemological approaches. As feminists\nturned to their reconstructive projects in the early 1990s, however,\nthey focused their criticisms on particular versions of epistemology,\nrecognizing that not all existing epistemologies were equally\ndifficult to work with. In particular, post-Kuhnian\nhistorically-oriented philosophies of science as well as naturalized\nepistemology proved to be very important resources. Besides the fact\nthat many feminists have been particularly interested in the workings\nof science as a dominant force in society, they have also found many\nforms of philosophy of science comparatively open to social\nanalyses.[6] This\nopenness stems from a recognition of the historically dynamic nature\nof knowledge not often evident in analytic epistemologies that focus\non the general conditions of knowledge rather than the specific\nmethodologies and activities of the sciences. Even more prominently,\nnaturalized epistemology has proven to be very conducive to analyses\nof the role of gender in knowing. It demands that we look and see,\nturning to empirical evidence of how in fact we do know rather than\nmaking a priori announcements concerning how we\nknow.[7] Thus,\nwhere it has been easy for certain forms of analytical epistemology to\ndismiss feminist empirical findings of the role of gender in knowledge\nas irrelevant to questions of serious epistemological import,\nnaturalized epistemology insists that such empirical findings must\nhave something important to tell us about knowledge production, or at\na minimum, must be accounted for. Hence naturalized epistemology\ncannot consistently dismiss such findings of the role of\ngender. Despite the individualism of many naturalized epistemologies,\na naturalized approach can operate as a very strong argument for a\nsocial epistemology: looking at how human beings know leaves little\ndoubt that the vast majority of our knowing takes place socially. Even\nif the \u201csocially\u201d is understood in the minimal sense of individuals\ninteracting with each other by exchanging information, this social\ninteraction has the potential to be infused with the dynamics of\ngender, opening the door for analyses of how gender affects knowledge\nexchanges. While rejecting his individualism, many feminist\nepistemologists have relied heavily on the resources of Quine, from\nhis overall naturalized approach to the specifics of his holistic\ntheory of evidence (Antony 1993; Campbell 1998; Nelson 1990,\n1996). Other feminists have followed by adopting a strongly pragmatic\nmodel, encouraging an empirical process of decision making in which\ntruth is assigned locally and fallibly, and issues of skepticism that\nhave plagued epistemology are demoted (Clough 2003). \n\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the output of works in feminist social\nepistemology was rich and varied. Early in the decade substantive\nworks appeared in feminist philosophy of science (Harding 1991;\nLongino 1990; Nelson 1990) along with significant developments in\nstandpoint theory (Collins 1990; Harding 1991), postmodern feminist\nepistemology (Haraway 1991) and analyses of the role of subjectivity\nin knowing (Code 1991).  By the mid-1990s, articles of feminist social\nepistemology were making appearances in numerous mainstream analytic\nphilosophical journals, with special issues devoted to feminist\nepistemology in The Monist (1994), Philosophical\nTopics (1995) and Synthese (1995). Throughout the\ndecade, the work of feminist social epistemologists addressed many\nissues being taken up by other social epistemologists as well: the\ndynamics of testimony and relations of cognitive authority, communal\nanalyses of evidence and epistemic agency, the social structure of\nscientific knowledge, social conceptions of objectivity, and\nunderstandings of knowledge as social practice. In 2002, Social\nEpistemology devoted a special issue to \u201cFeminist\nEpistemology as Social Epistemology\u201d in which it was noted that\nsocial epistemology and feminist epistemology shared many challenges\nand were similarly positioned against \u201ca dominant\nepistemological tradition of hypernormative and individualistic\nanalysis\u201d (Grasswick and Webb 2002). The\njournal Episteme, which began in 2004 as a journal of social\nepistemology (though it later broadened its scope to cover both\nindividual and social epistemology) devoted two issues in 2006 to\nquestions of the epistemic relevance of diversity. Yet despite\nfeminist epistemology\u2019s shared interests with others in the developing\nfield of social epistemology, there has been perhaps less\ncross-pollination over the years than one might\n expect.[8] \nA partial explanation for this lies in the different intellectual\nagendas that drive the development of the respective fields, including\nthe fact that nonfeminist social epistemologists have generally had a\nless political agenda than feminist social epistemologists. For\nexample, feminist social epistemologies have been driven by, and\nfocused on, epistemological questions directly pertinent to knowing\nunder conditions of oppression, conditions that are very significant\nfor feminists to come to understand. Ultimately, the direction of\nfeminist social epistemology as a field has been guided by the needs\nand challenges of feminist theory and activism. A good example of this\nis evident in the shift to a broadening of social identity categories\ntaken to be epistemically relevant. As feminist theory in all its\nguises developed throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, it became\napparent that gender was not the only significant social category, and\nmore importantly that gender could not be properly understood in\nisolation from other social categories such as race and ethnicity,\nclass, sexuality, ability status, and global location. Many feminist\ntheorists were criticized on the grounds that their focus on gender\nhad assumed a commonality across women and paid inadequate attention\nto the ways in which one person\u2019s gendered experience is\nsimultaneously shaped by their other social positions. The feminist\ncommitment to investigating the role of power relations in epistemic\nmatters (whatever form they took) soon revealed that the relevant\npower relations were complex and dynamic. As a result, feminist social\nepistemology began to attend more closely to the intersections between\nvarious social categories. By 1993, Alcoff and Potter noted that\nfeminist epistemology should no longer be taken \u201cas involving a\ncommitment to gender as the primary axis of oppression, in any sense\nof \u2018primary,\u2019 or positing that gender is a theoretical\nvariable separable from other axes of oppression and susceptible to a\nunique analysis\u201d (Alcoff and Potter 1993,\n3\u20134). Nevertheless, they suggested the continued use of the term\n\u201cfeminist epistemologies\u201d as marking the body of work that\nhas historically evolved out of a concern with the relations between\ngender and knowledge (Alcoff and Potter 1993, 4). \n2. Social Models of Knowers\n\n\nOne of the major contributions of feminist social epistemologies has\nbeen their thorough critique of the individualism of modern\nepistemology, and their corresponding reconstructions of epistemic\nsubjects as situated knowers. Elizabeth Anderson argues that\nit is feminist epistemologies\u2019 investigation into \u201chow the social\nlocation of the knower affects what and how she knows\u201d that properly\nplace them within the realm of social epistemologies (Anderson 2011).\nAlong with other social epistemologists, feminists have found\nthemselves at least initially presenting their work as responses to a\ndominantly individualistic tradition. From the Cartesian beginnings of\nmodern epistemology where knowledge was thought to result from the\ncareful exercise of an individual\u2019s mental faculties, to the dominant\ncontemporary epistemological frameworks resting on \u201cS knows that\np\u201d formulations where \u201cS\u201d can be any epistemic\nsubject, feminist social epistemologists have drawn attention to the\ninadequacies of the abstract individualism prevalent in epistemology\n(Code 1991; Jaggar 1983; Scheman 1995). The problems, feminists have\nargued, lie not simply in the claim that knowers are primarily\nindividuals, but rather that these individual knowers are themselves\nconceptualized as generic (or interchangeable) and self-sufficient (or\ncapable of self-sufficiency) in knowing (Code 1991; Grasswick\n2004). The conjunction of these three features forms what has been\ncalled the\natomistic model of knowers. The model does not deny that\nknowers have identities and social locations, but it does deny that\nthese are relevant features to include in epistemic\nassessments. Though not a full-fledged solipsism, the atomistic view\nputs forth a methodological solipsism for epistemological purposes\n(Potter 1993), and is antithetical to social analyses of\nknowledge. For example, if one\u2019s epistemology begins with the\nassumption that all knowers are interchangeable, then any differences\nin individuals based on social location, including gender, will be\ndeemed epistemically irrelevant from the start. Similarly, if one\u2019s\nepistemology begins with the assumption that knowers are or can be\nself-sufficient, analyses will focus on the types of knowledge that\nmight be attainable in solitude, such as simple observational\nexpressions as \u201cThe cat is on the mat\u201d, ignoring more complex\nknowledge, such as \u201cthe economy is in a recession\u201d, or \u201cour society\nsuffers from patriarchy\u201d, and leaving out of the analysis the social\ninteractions that make many forms of knowledge\npossible.[9] Many\nfeminists have identified the prevalence of the atomistic model within\nepistemology as an obstacle to the development of an accurate\nunderstanding of the epistemic roles of gender and other features of\nidentity that track systematic power relations, arguing that\nalternative, more social models of knowers are necessary.\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, feminist attention to the identity of the\nepistemic subject abounded in such titles as Who Knows?\n(Nelson 1990), What Can She Know? (Code 1991) and Whose\nScience? Whose Knowledge? (Harding 1991). \u201cSituated knowers\u201d\nbecame a key term in feminist epistemologies, though theorists varied\nsignificantly on the specifics of the concept. Some focused on the\nsocially differentiated nature of knowers (in contrast to the generic\nnature of knowers in the atomistic model), while others focused on\ntheir social interactive nature (in contrast to the self-sufficiency\nof knowers in the atomistic model). Still others argued for the\nadoption of the community as primary knower (in contrast to the\nindividual as primary knower in the atomistic model). Many of these\narguments intersect with each other. For example, by emphasizing the\ndifferentiated nature of knowers one strengthens the argument for the\nepistemic interdependence of knowers; interaction between knowers\nbecomes crucial so that individuals can access knowledge beyond the\nreach of their specific social location. Since conceptions of knowers\ncarry normative weight, making distinctions between those who know and\nthose who don\u2019t, or between those who know more or less well, feminist\ndiscussions of situated knowers are very much integrated with their\ndiscussions of the objectivity and justification of knowledge claims\n(see Section 3:\n Social Models of Knowledge and Objectivity).\n2.1 Differentiated Knowers and Standpoint Theory\n\n\nAt the core of many the feminist discussions of knowers is the idea\nthat experiential differences lead to differences in perspective, and\nthese perspectival differences carry epistemic consequences. At first,\nthis suggestion may appear epistemically innocuous. Even a staunch\nsupporter of the atomistic view can acknowledge that we don\u2019t all share\nthe same experiences, and if one is an empiricist, holding that one\nobtains knowledge primarily through experience, one can acknowledge\nthat different experiences will lead to different knowledge bases. But\nfor the atomist, this point is not epistemically interesting, because a\ndifferent knower could know the same thing as another if she\nwere to have the particular experience in question. In this\nsense, knowers are interchangeable for the atomist. Feminists who argue\nfor the epistemic relevance of the identity of knowers, however, are\ninterested in forms of knowing for which it is questionable whether a\ndifferently located knower could have the same experience. To\ngive an obvious example, sex-specific bodily experiences, such as\nknowing pain during childbirth, cannot be accessed by members of the\nother sex. Feminists arguing for differentiated knowers expand this\nidea, suggesting that there is a vast range of experiences\ndifferentiated along the lines of social location. In a\ngender-structured society, for example, a girl\u2019s experience in math\nclass might differ significantly from her male counterpart\u2019s\nexperience. The differences in knowers that feminists attend to are not\nrandom or idiosyncratic, but are socially structured and systematic,\nwith the potential to be major influences on people\u2019s lives. The\nfeminist arguments that gender is an epistemically relevant category of\nsocial location apply only as long as the society under consideration\nis structured along the lines of gender.\n\n\nWhat makes these feminist arguments interesting is that they do more\nthan argue for a direct link between having a certain experience and\nobtaining a certain piece of knowledge (though they include such cases\nin their analyses too). The intervening concept is that of perspective.\nIf social location shapes one\u2019s perspective on the world (through\ndifferential experiences) and we can only interact with the world and\nknow it through that perspective, then the areas of knowledge for which\none\u2019s social location is relevant may be very broad indeed, and may\ninclude areas of knowledge not obviously connected to the experiences\nof a particular social location. According to these arguments, one\u2019s\nperspective both shapes and sets limits on how a particularly located\nindividual can know, at least through her own achievements. Such\narguments also suggest that institutions of knowledge production that\nare dominated by a particular group may be influenced by the\nperspective of that group, without that perspective being recognized.\nFor example, many who argue that the underrepresentation of women in\nscience is a concern do so not simply from the belief that women should\nbe afforded equal opportunities, but also out of a worry that the\nscience might be shaped by a dominant masculine perspective (Addelson\n1983; Keller 1985; Lloyd 1984), making the underrepresentation of women\nan epistemic issue as well as a justice issue.\n\n\nFeminist standpoint theory has done the most to articulate the\nimportance of perspectival differences stemming from social location.\nAdopted from elements of Marxist theory, feminist standpoint theory\nalso represents one of the more thorough attempts to ground\nepistemology and, correspondingly, a view of knowers in a social\ntheory.  It ties social location very closely to epistemic position,\narguing that social locations not only vary from an epistemological\npoint of view, but that some social locations offer the potential to\nbe more epistemically reliable than others. According to strands of\nMarxist materialism developed by Georg Luk\u00e1cs, one\u2019s social\nposition with respect to material labor is inversely related to one\u2019s\nepistemic position. Society is structured primarily along the lines of\ntwo classes, the working class (proletariat) and the capitalists (the\nbourgeoisie) who own the means of production. As the privileged class,\nthe capitalists have a motivation to maintain the status quo, and this\ninterest interferes in their ability to understand the exploitation of\nthe working class upon which their capitalist privilege depends. The\nworking class, however, as the socially underprivileged, can achieve a\nricher understanding of social relations; they not only have a\nmotivation to understand the true nature of the exploitation to which\nthey are subject (in order to be able to end to the exploitation), but\ntheir position offers the potential for a dual vision. Since they are\nsubject to the rules of the capitalists who wield social power, the\nworking class has an understanding of the capitalists\u2019 view of the\nworld. But additionally, they have an experiential understanding of\ntheir own lives as the exploited. Thus, their position as socially\nunderprivileged affords them the possibility of an epistemic privilege\nstemming from this dual vision. \n\n\nEarly feminist standpoint theory draws on these ideas, but rests on a sexual\ndivision of labor rather than class divisions. Sociologist Dorothy\nSmith argues for the epistemic advantage women sociologists have over\nmale sociologists in their experience of a \u201cbifurcated\nconsciousness\u201d, caught as they are between the conceptual world\nof sociology and the material world of their lives as women (Smith\n1974). Nancy Hartsock\u2019s 1983 articulation of the theory argues that\nwomen\u2019s contributions to subsistence and childrearing result in a\nsystematic difference of experience across the genders. Accordingly,\nthe activities of women that place them in a socially underprivileged\nposition can form the basis of a privileged epistemic standpoint,\nthrough which a deeper understanding of patriarchal institutions and\nideologies can be reached (Hartsock 1983). For most feminist\nstandpoint theorists, including Hartsock, a standpoint is understood\nas an \u201cachieved stance\u201d and is not just a synonym for a\n\u201cperspective\u201d. The achievement of an epistemically\nprivileged standpoint involves a political engagement that makes clear\nto the socially underprivileged the shared nature of their experiences\nof oppression and reveals the systematic structure of power\nrelations. \n\n\nFeminist standpoint theories have developed substantially over the\nyears, especially in response to feminist theorists\u2019 recognition that\ngender cannot be understood in isolation from other social\ncategories. For example, the highly influential work of Patricia Hill\nCollins puts forth the idea of a black women\u2019s standpoint, identifying\nspecific epistemic resources in black women\u2019s experience that are\nimportant to the development of black feminist thought (Collins\n1990). Recognizing the intersection of many axes of oppression,\nfeminist standpoint theorists have had to reconceptualize the idea of\nthe margins and move away from the original Marxian standpoint premise\nof a bifurcated society. As bell hooks has articulated, the margins\nmust be recognized as both sites of oppression and resistance (hooks\n1990). If this is the case, then the Marxian requirement that the\nepistemic privilege of the oppressed must stem from their being\npositioned as the inverse of the dominant in a bifurcated system, is\nmistaken. The oppressed can gain epistemic privilege through their\nresistance, without relying on the idea that they complete the system\nof power by being positioned as both marginal and central the system\u2019s\nfunctioning (Tanesini 1999).\n\n\nFeminist standpoint theories have been controversial because by\nconnecting epistemic perspective so closely to one\u2019s material and\nsocial location, they appear to posit chasms between knowers,\nsuggesting knowers are unable to share knowledge across social\nlocations (Nelson 1990; Walby 2001). Versions of standpoint theory\nhave also been criticized for failing to adequately account for\nphenomenon such as internalized oppression, in which the perspective\nof the oppressed is damaged by the forces of oppression and is\nunreliable. For example, feminists have argued that many women who\nblame themselves for their rapes have internalized damaging false\nbeliefs about their responsibilities and the causes of their rapes,\nmaking it problematic to consider their perspective epistemically\nadvantageous or reliable. Some versions of feminist standpoint theory\nhave had difficulty accounting for the coherence of a feminist\nstandpoint while acknowledging that women are variously situated and\ndo not experience gender oppression (or any particular form of\noppression) in the same way. Standpoint theories have also been\ncriticized for valorizing the agency of those in the margins, and the\nsame time as falsely theorizing a single central power in society (Bar\nOn 1993). It has also been important for standpoint theories to\nspecify the scope of their claims.  Claims concerning the epistemic\nsignificance of social location have seemed most plausible for\nunderstanding social relations, and this is certainly the focus of the\noriginal contributions of standpoint theories.  But there may be\nadditional realms of knowledge for which social location is\nsignificant, and social location may not play out in the same way in\nall realms. Alison Wylie has argued that it is a contingent matter,\nopen to empirical investigation, how certain subdominant standpoints\noffer epistemic advantages in particular fields of knowledge\n(2003).\n\n\nLooking back on the developments of standpoint theories, Sandra\nHarding has argued that while they have been the most controversial of\nfeminist epistemologies, they have also been the most productive with\nrespect to their application in research projects across the\ndisciplines (Harding 2009). Harding argues that they offer an\nincredibly effective methodology in the production of sound knowledge\nabout marginalized groups. As a methodology, standpoint theories\ninsist that researchers focus their attention on the standpoints of\nthe underprivileged, striving to understand the world from these\nvantage points, and successfully uncovering a good deal of knowledge\nabout the lives of the underprivileged in the process.\n\n\nUltimately, the plausibility of standpoint theories as epistemologies\ndepends on their specific details, and many versions have developed\nsignificantly since their first articulations. Additionally, many\nfeminist social epistemologists who ultimately reject standpoint\ntheory have adopted some form of the idea that social location is\nconnected to epistemic perspective in significant ways, and hence that\nknowers are differentiated. The controversies evoked by standpoint\ntheories and their criticisms also have stimulated important\ndiscussions concerning how feminist social epistemologists are to\nunderstand the exact nature of the relationship between social\nlocation and epistemic perspective. With such developments, some\nfeminist empiricists such as Kristen Intemann have become interested\nin drawing on the strengths of both empiricism and standpoint theory,\nproposing a merger of the two approaches (Intemann 2010). \n2.2 Interactive and Relational Knowers\n\n\nFeminist social epistemologists also stress the socially interactive\nnature of knowers, arguing that epistemically, human beings are deeply\ndependent on one another. At least three strains of argument support a\nrecognition of our epistemic dependence and correspondingly, the\ninteractive nature of knowers.\n\nFirst, feminist social epistemologists who focus on institutional\nforms of knowing such as scientific research, medical practice, and\nlegal systems understand that in these contexts we are highly reliant\non others to produce knowledge for us. Not only do laypersons rely on\nexperts for knowledge, but even within epistemic communities such as\nin research teams there are cognitive divisions of labor that result\nin a dependence on other experts for knowledge relevant to one\u2019s\nown research. More than many other social epistemologists interested\nin cognitive divisions of labor, feminist social epistemologists\ndevelop analyses that attend to the power dynamics within epistemic\ncommunities, examining correlations between structures of cognitive\nand social authority, and demonstrating their influence on the\ndirection of research.\n Kathryn Pyne Addelson (1983), for example,\nargues that in order to increase the rationality of scientific\nresearch, we need to include in our assessments criticism of the\nsocial arrangements within the scientific communities. For example, if\nsocial relations are such that men disproportionately hold the most\nsignificant positions of social and cognitive authority within\nscientific communities, the direction of research as well as the\nchoice of methods and metaphysical assumptions underlying research may\ndisproportionately reflect men\u2019s experiences and perspectives.\nUnderstanding the workings of such social arrangements can help us\nbetter assess the overall rationality and quality of scientific\nresearch. Feminists have also stressed the particular vulnerabilities\nof the oppressed that stem from their reliance on experts, when lines\nof credibility and expertise are woven into an oppressive set of\nsocial arrangements (Code 1991, 2006; Sherwin 1992).  Whereas some\nsocial epistemologists take the presence of cognitive divisions of\nlabor to offer support for a view of communities as\nknowers,[10]\nthose feminist social epistemologists who focus on cognitive divisions\nof labor (as opposed to other dimensions of knowing that might point\nin the direction of communities as knowers) tend to focus instead on\nthe epistemic role of trust, allowing that individuals can know beyond\ntheir personal grasp of the evidence, but insisting on philosophical\nanalysis of the vulnerabilities and negotiations that play out through\nsuch dependence on others (Scheman 2001; Code 2006).\n\n\nSecond, arguments to the effect that knowers are differentiated from\neach other along the lines of social location suggest that in many\ncases knowers must rely on others differently situated from themselves\nin order to attain certain forms of knowledge. If perspectives differ\nalong the lines of social location, then one cannot necessarily trust\none\u2019s own perspective as epistemically reliable in a particular area\nof knowledge and one will need to interact with others differently\nsocially located in order to increase the reliability of one\u2019s\nknowing. For example, a white male department chair may need to\nconsult with professors who have experienced sexism and racism in the\nclassroom in order to determine whether a white male student complaint\nabout a young Chicana professor is legitimate or not (Alcoff 2001).\nMany feminist social epistemologists who focus on socially\ndifferentiated knowers argue that the necessary interaction cannot\njust be epistemic in nature; when categories of social location are\nhierarchically structured as they are in oppressive societies, social\nand political alliances must be built between groups in order to\ndevelop the trust necessary to share knowledge across social\nlocations.  Others have argued that in some cases the distrust across\nsocial locations is so strong that only relationships of friendship\nare sufficiently deep to allow for the sharing of knowledge and\nunderstanding across locations (Lugones 1987).\n\n\nThird, recognizing that as children we are highly dependent on others\nboth for our care and for the development of our epistemic skills,\nsome feminist social epistemologists have argued that our epistemic\ndependence runs as deep as the conditions of epistemic agency\nitself. Building on the work of Annette Baier (1985), Lorraine Code\nhas argued that epistemically, knowers are best thought of as \u201csecond\npersons\u201d, who acquire epistemic skills through others, and who are\ndependent on others\u2019 acknowledgment of them as an epistemic agent in\norder to develop and exercise epistemic agency (Code 1991). It is\nthrough our interactions with others and our development as children\nthat we learn the skills of knowing, learn what constitutes knowing,\nand come to be counted among others as knowers. An implication of\nCode\u2019s view is that if one is systematically denied acknowledgment as\na knower and credibility is consistently withheld, as can happen in\nsystems of oppression, then one\u2019s epistemic agency and capacity to\nknow will be diminished. Her arguments support a relational view of\nepistemic agency, one that still recognizes individuals as knowers,\nbut conceptualizes them as socially constituted and epistemically\ndependent on their interactions with others. Similarly Miranda Fricker\ntakes our role as testifiers to be central to epistemic agency, such\nthat if credibility is consistently denied, one\u2019s epistemic agency is\nundermined (Fricker 2007). \n\n\nWhile some feminist social epistemologists such as Code and Fricker focus on\ninterpersonal relations within a community, others draw attention to\nthe importance of a knower\u2019s relations with multiple communities. They\nargue that many of the insights of feminist critics of science were\nmade possible by bridge knowers, individual feminist scientists\ninteracting with both scientific communities and feminist communities (Fehr 2011).\nSuch cases suggest the need for a model of knowers that accounts for an\nindividual\u2019s dynamic relations with multiple communities (Tuana 1995).\nThe idea of knowers as individuals-in-communities has been\nsuggested as a model that both captures the importance of\ninterrelations with multiple communities and, by keeping individual\nknowers in the foreground, is capable of attending to the power\nrelations that individual knowers must negotiate within those\ncommunities (Grasswick 2004).\n\n\nAcknowledgment of the various forms of our epistemic interdependence\nhas motivated investigations of the dynamics of social interaction and\ntheir effects on knowledge production. For example, recognizing that\nwe frequently rely on the testimony of others, yet also make judgments\non the worth of the testimony, feminist social epistemologists have\ninvestigated the complex links between assignments of credibility and\nsocial position (Alcoff 2001; Code 1995; Jones 2002). Many conclude\nthat because of our epistemic interdependence, adequate epistemic\nanalysis must attend to the political and moral dimensions of our\nsocial-epistemic interactions (Code 1995). For example, Miranda\nFricker argues that there is social pressure to grant greater than\nwarranted degrees of credibility to those with social power, with the\neffect that we do less well at attaining truths and avoiding\nfalsehoods.  Her conclusion is that an adequate social epistemology\nmust acknowledge and assess the epistemic effects of power\nrelations. As she writes, \u201cepistemology will not be truly socialized\nuntil it has been appropriately politicized\u201d (Fricker 1998,\n174). Feminist arguments for the importance of trust in knowing (Code\n1991, 1995; Scheman 2001) coupled with their analyses of the moral and\naffective dimensions of trust (Baier 1986; Jones 1996, 2002) also\nsuggest that the moral quality of social relations is important to\nassess as part of one\u2019s epistemic analysis. Attention to the links\nbetween the moral and the epistemic have developed in detail with\nrecent developments on the topic of epistemic injustice (see Section\n4: Epistemic Values, Ethics, and Democracy). \n2.3 Communities as Knowers\n\n\nStatements pointing to communities as knowers can be found in a wide\nvariety of feminist epistemologists (Harding 1993; Longino 2002; Nelson\n1990; Potter 1993), though they do not all embrace the same\narguments.\n\n\nSome arguments to the effect that it is communities rather than\nindividuals who are properly thought of as knowers build on the\narguments for the interactive nature of knowers. For example, Helen\nLongino argues that claims and theories can only achieve the status of\nknowledge by going through a public process of critical scrutiny, in\nwhich individual knowers engage with each other epistemically in joint\nendeavors. She allows that individuals can know particular claims, but\nit is communities who are the knowledge producers, since it takes\nsocial processes of critical engagement to transform beliefs and\ntheories into knowledge (2002). The norms that must be satisfied to\nachieve knowledge are communal norms, requiring certain social\ninteractions to occur. \n\n\nOther feminist social epistemologists who embrace a community model of\nknowers do so based on arguments that there are crucial public and\nshared elements of knowing that cannot be understood by viewing\nindividuals in isolation (Webb 1995). Along these lines, communities\ncan be understood as knowers in the sense that a communal context is\nrequired for knowing. Individuals know only within communities.\nArguments for such a view are supported by claims that language and\nconceptual schemas are required for knowledge, which are themselves\ncommunity specific and acquired by individuals through participation\nin communities. A great deal of work in feminist social epistemology\nand feminist science studies has documented how gendered assumptions\nthat stem from features of our social organization make their way into\nthe metaphors and conceptual schemas of knowledge production (for\nexample, Bleier 1984; Haraway 1991; Hubbard 1983; Keller 1985, 1992;\nLloyd 1984; Martin 1991). Many feminist social epistemologists have\nfound it necessary to turn to the level of the communally-shared\nconcepts and assumptions in order to explain why gendered work has\nbeen accepted and gone unnoticed within science for so long.\n\n\nAn argument advocating an even stronger model of communities as\nprimary knowers comes from Lynn Hankinson Nelson (1990, 1993). Nelson\u2019s\nwork is inspired by Quine and his holistic theory of evidence in which\nthere are no firm boundaries between evidence and theory. What Nelson\nincludes in her conception of evidence that Quine did not is the larger\nsocial and political context within which science is produced. She\ncouples this with arguments for the historically dynamic nature of the\ncategory of evidence; changes in public and communal standards of\nevidence will result in changes to the evidence itself. According to\nNelson it is communities who construct and share knowledge and\nstandards of evidence, and thus it must be communities who are the\nprimary agents of knowledge (Nelson 1990, 256). Nelson\u2019s point is that\nif we are to understand why a particular theory is supported at a\nparticular time, we must examine communities, not just isolated\nindividuals. Her arguments allow her to explain how androcentric\nscience has lost its evidential support: although androcentric science\nmay have enjoyed considerable evidential support at one time, changes\nin the social and political context of particular communities resulted\nin feminist work both revealing and resisting the influence of\nandrocentric assumptions. This shift in the communal standards of\nevidence has diminished evidential support for androcentric\nresearch.\n\n\nFeminist social epistemologists who argue for a community model of\nknowers do not deny that individuals also know. However, their accounts\nchallenge the possibility of understanding individuals as knowers in\nisolation from their communities, and press for a better understanding\nof the relative roles of individuals and communities in knowing. For\nexample, communal accounts of knowing suggest that the epistemic\nresponsibilities of individuals will need to be understood in relation\nto their communal memberships, which set limits on the conceptual\nresources and epistemic tools individuals have available to\n them.[11] \nCynthia Townley has also argued that understanding our relationships\nwithin communities is crucial to understanding epistemic practices,\nsince those practices involve us in far more than simply generating\nknowledge for ourselves; each of us negotiates instead a variety of\nepistemic roles and dependencies beyond generating knowledge and being\nreliable testifiers (Townley 2011). \n3. Social Models of Knowledge and Objectivity\n\n\nWith much of their work drawing attention to the perspectival nature\nof knowing and community-specific elements of knowing, feminist social\nepistemologists also need to articulate how we are to distinguish\nbetween better and worse knowing, or how we are able to identify\nobjective knowledge. In a 1988 article, Donna Haraway first introduced\nthe term situated knowledges to feminist epistemology, as a\nway of expressing a form of objectivity that takes seriously the\nsocial construction of knowledge and the perspectival nature of\nknowledge demonstrated by feminists. By invoking situated knowledges,\nHaraway suggests that all knowledge is local and limited, denying the\npossibility of the impartial view-from-nowhere that has often been\nassociated with the perspective of objective knowledge. What Haraway\nsuggests instead is an embodied objectivity (recognizing our material\nlocations) that consists in partial connection across perspectives or\nlocations: given the limited and perspectival nature of all knowing,\nthe most we can hope for is forms of knowledge that are objective in\nthe sense that they are translatable across particular subjective\nlocations. For Haraway, it is through building political solidarities\nand engaging in epistemic conversations across our positionings that\nwe come to agreement on how to know certain aspects of the world, but\nthese agreements will never completely erase the differences in our\nperspectives. Other feminist social epistemologists offer different\nanalyses of how to attain such partial connection.\n3.1 Strong Objectivity\n\n\nStandpoint theorists, and many who are inspired by standpoint theory,\nnot only maintain Haraway\u2019s situated knowledge thesis,\nconceptualizing all knowledge as perspectival, but also hold a\nstronger thesis that some of those perspectives are epistemically more\nvaluable than others. In other words, some perspectives lead to\nobjectivity in a way that others do not. While the privileging of some\nepistemic perspectives ensures that standpoint theory bears normative\ncontent, it remains to be explained how one attains a privileged\nepistemic standpoint that will lead to objective knowledge, and how\none can identify such a standpoint.\n\n\nAlthough a few standpoint theorists argue for a women\u2019s standpoint\nstemming directly from women\u2019s experience, most influential standpoint\ntheorists including Hartsock (1983) and Harding (1986) insist that the\nMarxist-inspired arguments imply that although the feminist standpoint\nis deeply connected to the lives of women, the epistemically\nprivileged nature of the feminist standpoint stems from active\npolitical engagement in the feminist cause, and does not just\nrepresent the perspective of women. Thus, a certain kind of political\nactivity is required in order to appreciate the situation of women or\nother oppressed groups. This sense of standpoint goes beyond the idea\nof perspective, and refers to the capacity to develop \u201ca\ncritical consciousness about the nature of our social location and the\ndifference it makes epistemically\u201d. The idea of a standpoint\nbuilds upon, but is distinctive from the situated knowledge thesis\nthat recognizes the importance of social location in shaping epistemic\nperspective (Wylie 2003, 31). A standpoint does not naturally or\nautomatically arise from a particular social location, although the\nexperiences of an oppressed social location can make the achievement\nof a standpoint more likely.\n\n\nHarding has developed this idea further in her call for researchers to\nstart their research from the lives of women and, more generally, the\nlives of marginalized groups, regardless of their own social location\n(Harding 1991). This line of reasoning weakens the connection between\nsocial or material location and epistemic perspective, since\npresumably a researcher can access a privileged epistemic perspective\nwithout occupying the relevant social location through the appropriate\ncritical work. Yet it maintains the situated knowledge thesis that\nperspectives are differentiated according to social location, and it\ncalls on researchers to engage in reflexive analysis of how their own\nsocial location shapes their research. Harding argues that such\nreflexive analysis, coupled with an active attempt to engage in\nresearch from the perspectives of the oppressed will result in a\nstronger form of objectivity than the \u201cweak objectivity\u201d\navailable through a neutral approach to knowing that ignores the role\nof social location and cultural assumptions in shaping one\u2019s\nperspective.  Harding\u2019s strong objectivity results from an\nacknowledgment of the perspectival nature of all knowing, and a\ndetermined effort to examine the world from the positions of the\nsocially underprivileged rather than the privileged. The result,\naccording to standpoint theorists such as Harding, will be knowledge\nthat is less partial and distorted, and hence, more objective.\n3.2 Objectivity as a Social Process\n\n\nNumerous feminist social epistemologists, particularly those working\nin philosophy of science, have employed the underdetermination thesis\nto argue for the necessary role of background assumptions in theory\nchoice (Anderson 1995b; Longino 1990, 2002; Nelson 1990; Potter 1996).\nIf theory is underdetermined by the data, and multiple theories can\nalways explain the data equally well, then data alone cannot determine\nthe best theory. Background assumptions must be employed as well. The\nproblem is that background assumptions, which may include\nmethodological assumptions, assumptions with empirical content,\nmetaphysical assumptions, and value-laden assumptions, are rarely\narticulated. They may also be gendered, or otherwise shaped by\nculturally salient social identity categories. Drawing attention to\nthe necessary role of these often unarticulated assumptions has\nallowed feminist philosophers of science to explain both how\nandrocentric and sexist assumptions have managed to persevere for so\nlong in science, as well as why feminist values do not have to be\neliminated from scientific research in order for it to constitute good\nscience. But in order to make epistemic distinctions and continue to\nclaim that some theory choices are better than others, they must\nexplain how we are to sort through and select those background\nassumptions we are willing to rely on.\n\n\nHelen Longino has developed a very influential theory of contextual\nempiricism that includes a social conception of objectivity. According\nto Longino, a theory is objective if it has undergone and survived a\ncertain social process of critical scrutiny. Through public critical\nscrutiny, the background assumptions upon which particular theories\ndepend for their support have the potential to be revealed, and\nidiosyncratic assumptions can be weeded out. In order to ensure that\nthis system of public scrutiny is working well, Longino sets out four\ngoverning norms of interaction in an epistemic community: there must\nbe publicly recognized forums for criticism, uptake of criticism,\npublic standards, and tempered (to allow for differences in\nintellectual capacity) equality of intellectual authority (Longino\n 2002).[12]\n To the extent that these norms of social interaction are fulfilled by\nan epistemic community, the theories they are considering will be\nsubject to the appropriate kind of public critical scrutiny, and their\nresults will be objective. Diverse representation within the community\nalso becomes important, since \u201ca diversity of perspectives is\nnecessary for vigorous and epistemically effective critical discourse\u201d\n(Longino 2002, 131). The greater the diversity in the community, the\ngreater the opportunity for revealing background assumptions that may\nbe shared by large segments of the membership. Once a background\nassumption is revealed, the process of critical scrutiny determines\nwhether it is acceptable or problematic and in need of rejection. The\nresultant knowledge will not be aperspectival and will not be free of\nbackground assumptions. However, it will represent a perspective that is\nbroader than any one individual can bring to the table; it will also have been\nfound appropriate for the particular epistemic goals of the\ncommunity.\n\n\nOthers describe the possibility of objectivity given the perspectival\nnature of knowledge in a slightly different way. Using the term\n\u201cbias\u201d to refer to interest or perspective, Louise Antony\ncharacterizes the challenge for feminist epistemologists who criticize\nthe idea of objectivity as neutrality or impartiality as the\n\u201cbias paradox\u201d: such feminists both criticize neutrality\nand impartiality (arguing that such impartiality is impossible due to\nthe situatedness of knowledge) at the same time as they must appeal to\nimpartiality in criticizing male bias as \u201cbad\u201d (Antony\n1993). Her solution is to adopt a naturalistic and empirical approach\nto biases, embracing the idea that biases are an inevitable component\nof knowing, but arguing that it is an empirical question to determine\nwhich biases are good in that they lead to the truth, and which are\nbad in that they lead us away from truth. Richmond Campbell develops\nthese ideas further, arguing that armed with realist conceptions of\ntruth and objective justification, we can explain (without\ncircularity) how feminist biases can lead us closer to the truth\nwithin contexts of systematic gender bias in epistemic communities\n(Campbell 2001, 1998). Elizabeth Anderson uses the case study of\nfeminist research on divorce to argue that the feminist values (which\nCampbell and Antony might consider biases) used in such research are\nboth empirically testable and supported by the evidence (Anderson\n2004). Sharyn Clough suggests that such a holistic relationship\nbetween descriptive facts and prescriptive values forms a core feature\nof feminist science studies (Clough 2004). Miriam Solomon\ncharacterizes such views described above as \u201cfeminist radical\nempiricism\u201d because they adopt the view that not only are\nfactual claims empirically testable (as do other feminist\nempiricists), but more radically they embrace the idea that the values\nor biases that inform our theory choices are also empirically testable\nthemselves (Solomon 2012). Solomon herself argues for a more\npluralistic understanding of the role of values in knowledge\nproduction, noting that values are sometimes relevant to the domain of\ninquiry and can be empirically tested, but not always. Still others\nsuch as Audrey Yap caution against any presumption that empirically\ntesting our values will be useful in promoting social change, given\ndeep sources of prejudice and stereotyping (Yap 2016).  \n4. Epistemic Values, Ethics, and Democracy\n\n\nWith its turn to situated knowing, feminist epistemology can be\ndescribed as having a pragmatic orientation, with a focus on how\nsituated knowers can know well and inquire well in their particular\nsocial worlds. By prioritizing questions concerning good inquiry and\nknowing activities, and arguing that such activities involve\ndependencies on others and social interactions, many feminist\nepistemologists emphasize the ethical dimensions of epistemic pursuits,\nsuggesting that the epistemic cannot be adequately understood if\nseparated out from ethical analysis (Code 1991, 2006). Once feminists\ndraw attention to the fact that knowing is something that we\ndo and do through engagement with others, the ethical\ndimension of knowing becomes apparent. With their interest in how\nagents actively engage in practices of knowing, many feminists have\ndeveloped versions of virtue epistemology that are agent-centered,\narticulating our epistemic responsibilities that often include an\nethical dimension as we interact with and depend on each other in\ninquiry (Code 1991, 2006; Daukas 2006, 2011; Fricker 2007).\nAdditionally, their focus on situated knowing directs feminist\nepistemologists to examine our knowing practices within particular\ncontexts rather than providing abstract analyses of generalizable\nconditions of knowledge acquisition. Such requirements of pragmatic\ncontextualization tend to result in integrative analyses that consider\nthe intersection of traditional epistemic goals with other social\nvalues and goals, including those with an ethical dimension. For\nexample, standards of evidence might rightly differ in various areas\nof knowledge production due to the differing risks of social harm that\ncan come from the generation of certain forms of knowledge. Feminist\nanalyses also draw attention to the different epistemic strategies\nrequired to address challenges that arise for situated knowers in\nspecific social contexts. For example, many feminist analyses focus on\nthe specific challenges that face the socially privileged and\nunderprivileged when they try to know within contexts of\noppression.\n\n\nFeminists\u2019 pragmatic orientation and interest in epistemic\ninquiry within social contexts has led to the development of several\ndifferent paths of investigation that explicitly draw connections\nbetween traditional epistemic values and social and ethical values in\nour epistemic practices, and expand the range of epistemic values under\nconsideration. Prominent topics of investigation include epistemic\ninjustice, epistemologies of ignorance, and the role of democratic\nstructures in knowledge production.\n4.1 Epistemic Injustice\n\n\nWhile testimony has emerged as a central topic in social\nepistemology generally, feminists have been major contributors to\ndiscussions of how social power plays out in the economies of\ncredibility. Focusing on the power differentials characteristic of\nsystematic oppression, Miranda Fricker\u2019s 2007 book Epistemic\nInjustice identifies testimonial injustice as one of two important\nforms of epistemic injustice. Testimonial injustice occurs when a\nspeaker is given less credibility than deserved (suffering a\ncredibility deficit) because of an identity prejudice held by the\nhearer. So for example, a woman might be less likely to be believed\nbecause of a prejudice on the part of the hearer regarding her gender.\nFricker argues that although it is correct to view testimonial\ninjustice as an ethical wrong insofar as it is an injustice, it is\nimportant to recognize the wrong as specifically epistemic in nature in\nthat it involves being wronged specifically in one\u2019s capacity as\na knower (2007, 20). Fricker considers our role as testifiers a core\ndimension of our epistemic lives, so to suffer a credibility deficit\nimpedes one\u2019s capacity as an epistemic agent, making it both an\nethical and an epistemic wrong when one suffers a deficit due to an\nidentity prejudice. Fricker also recommends a corrective to such\ninjustice. She frames her work in terms of a virtue epistemology of a\nresponsibilist form, and posits an epistemic virtue of testimonial\njustice. The virtue of testimonial justice involves an agent\u2019s\nreflexive critical social awareness. Such an awareness allows\na hearer to account for the likely impact of the identity power\nrelation that mediates between himself and the speaker on his\nspontaneous perception, essentially correcting for the problems that\ncan result in transactions of testimonial injustice (2007, 91). In a\nsimilar vein, Nancy Daukas argues for an explicitly social form of\nvirtue epistemology that takes as its core epistemic virtue\n\u201cepistemic trustworthiness\u201d (2006, 2011). For Daukas,\nepistemic trustworthiness includes dispositions to both represent\noneself as a credible testifier and reliably judge the credibility of\nothers. In order to achieve the latter in contexts of oppression where\nthere are social prejudices and epistemic practices that contribute to\nthe maintenance of a culture of domination, one must develop an\n\u201coppositional epistemic agency\u201d that involves a\n\u201ccritical acuity\u201d through which one can recognize and\nresist \u201cthe values and theoretical commitments embedded in\nepistemic practices and products that maintain a culture of domination\nand oppression\u201d (2011, 59).\n\n\nWhile Fricker and Daukas focus on the responses of individual agents\nas correctives to testimonial injustice, others have expanded on the\nbreadth and depth of the problem. For example, Elizabeth Anderson\nargues for the need to develop large-scale structural remedies such as\nensuring broadly inclusive epistemic institutions in order to fully\ncorrect for the systemic biases that result in testimonial injustices\n(Anderson 2012). Kristie Dotson points to the difficulties of even\nidentifying such practices of silencing and distinguishes two different\nkinds of silencing practices: testimonial quieting and testimonial\nsmothering. While testimonial quieting characterizes the failure to\nrecognize the speaker as a knower and thus the failure to offer the\nspeaker appropriate uptake, Dotson describes testimonial smothering as\na coerced truncation of one\u2019s testimony. Testimonial smothering\noccurs when a speaker recognizes her audience as unwilling or unable to\ngive the appropriate uptake to her testimony, and in response, limits\nand shapes her testimony in order to \u201cinsure that the testimony\ncontains only content for which one\u2019s audience demonstrates\ntestimonial competence\u201d (2011, 244). Dotson characterizes both of\nthese silencing practices as forms of epistemic violence, and both have\ndramatic epistemic effects for the epistemic pursuits of individuals\nand communities alike.\n\n\nFricker also discusses a second and related form of epistemic\ninjustice that has generated substantial discussion: hermeneutical\ninjustice. Hermeneutical injustice, involves a \u201cstructural\nprejudice in the economy of collective hermeneutical resources\u201d\n(2007, 1). Hermeneutical injustice occurs when there exists a lack of\ncollective interpretative resources required for a group to understand\n(and express) significant aspects of their social experience. Fricker\noffers the example of the situation of women who experienced episodes\nof what we now identify as sexual harassment, prior to it being named\nand recognized as such. Without the presence of a socially recognized\nconcept of sexual harassment, women were ill-equipped to both\nunderstand and convey these significant experiences and their harms.\n\n\nMany who have found hermeneutical injustice to be a powerful concept\nfor articulating the challenges of the oppressed in gaining and\nexpressing knowledge of their experiences have at the same time\npointed out the limitations of Fricker\u2019s analysis, and have diverged\nfrom her account accordingly. For example, some have argued that her\nanalysis misrepresents hermeneutical resources as collective, failing\nto acknowledge the pluralism of interpretative communities and\npractices through which marginalized groups may have access to\nalternative interpretations of their experiences (Mason 2011; Medina\n2012). Dotson, for example, argues that a third kind of epistemic\ninjustice exists, contributory injustice, through which a dominant\ngroup refuses to employ the hermeneutical resources that marginalized\ncommunities have developed to aid in understanding their experiences\n(Dotson 2012). In this, Dotson builds on Pohlhaus\u2019s conception of\n\u201cwillful hermeneutical ignorance\u201d through which the dominant refuse to\nengage with those hermeneutical resources (of the marginalized) that\nwould in effect challenge their ability to continue on in their\n(comfortable) misinterpretation and ignorance of the experiences of\nthe marginalized (Pohlhaus 2012). Relatedly, such cases can lead to a\nkind of epistemic exploitation, where the dominant assume it is the\nresponsibility of the marginalized to perform the labor necessary to\neducate them (the dominant) in the experiences of the oppressed\n(Berenstain 2016). Further, Medina analyses the performative dimension\nof hermeneutical injustice, noting that this features demonstrates its\nvery close links with testimonial injustice. These forms of epistemic\ninjustice do not operate independently. He argues that we must examine\nthe communicative dynamics that perpetuate hermeneutical injustices,\nin order to understand how agents can exercise hermeneutical\nsensitivities and responsibilities that would help erode such\ninjustices (Medina 2012).\n\n\nDiscussions of epistemic injustice offer an excellent example of work\nfocusing on the challenges of knowing in contexts of oppression,\nanalyzing how many of the wrongs that occur within such contexts have\nboth epistemic and ethical dimensions. Framing epistemic matters in\nterms of \u201cinjustice\u201d marks a significant development in\nsocial epistemology, through which attention is drawn to the complex\nnetwork of epistemic relations between knowers. At the same time, as\nthe discussions of epistemic injustice have broadened and attention\nhas turned to the interaction between different forms of epistemic\ninjustice and the inadequacy of transactional remedies between\nindividual knowers, some have found the language of epistemic\ninjustice and justice too limiting and have reached for different\nconcepts. For example, Dotson frames many of these issues in terms of\n\u201cepistemic oppression\u201d that involves \u201cpersistent epistemic exclusion\u201d\n(Dotson 2014), and Medina develops an \u201cepistemology of resistance\u201d in\nresponse to the epistemic dimensions of oppression (Medina 2013).\n4.2 Epistemologies of Ignorance\n\n\nFeminist epistemologists alongside critical race theorists have played\na prominent role in the development of epistemologies of ignorance, an\narea closely related to the work on epistemic injustice and epistemic\noppression. They have argued that epistemologists need to attend to\nthe role of ignorance as well as knowledge if they are to adequately\nunderstand the influence of power relations on epistemic matters.\nHermeneutical injustice offers an obvious example of how some forms of\nknowledge important to marginalized groups may be difficult or even\nimpossible to access as a result of systems of power relations that do\nnot support the development of the necessary conceptual resources for\nthat knowledge. Specific pockets of ignorance result from these\nsystematic power relations. Epistemologies of ignorance maintain that\nignorances are often not simply benign gaps in knowledge that have yet\nto be filled. Rather, ignorances can be actively constructed and can\nserve purposes of domination (Sullivan and Tuana 2007; Tuana and\nSullivan 2006). On this line of reasoning, the production of ignorance\nneeds to be understood as a substantive practice itself (Alcoff\n2007).\n\n\nOne of the goals of epistemologies of ignorance is to understand the\ncomplexity of the relations of ignorance and knowledge, mapping out\nvarious kinds of ignorances and developing normative frameworks to\nhelp understand when ignorances are problematic, and when epistemic\nagents should be held epistemically responsible for their\nignorances. Dotson notes that the ignorances to be concerned about are\nthose that are both reliable and pernicious (harmful) (Dotson\n2011). Clearly, not all forms of ignorance will be pernicious, nor\nwill they all be avoidable. Cynthia Townley has also argued for the\npositive value of ignorance in our epistemic practices, recognizing\nthat our rich relations of epistemic dependence require trust, which\nitself requires ignorance and a commitment to refrain from remedying\nit (2011, 23).  Furthermore, the specific epistemic relationships we\ndevelop with others require that certain forms of knowledge be shared\nwith some, but not others, calling into question any idea that the\nonly epistemic value is the acquisition of knowledge for oneself and\nothers (Townley 2003, 2011; Grasswick 2011). Feminists have also noted\nthe importance of \u201cstrategic ignorance\u201d through which the\noppressed can use \u201cdominant misconceptions as a basis for active\ncreative responses to oppression\u201d (Bailey 2007, 88). For\nexample, the oppressed may act in ways that conform to the\nexpectations of their dominators, pretending to lack intelligence\nperhaps, allowing access to information and resources that may help\nthem either resist or at least survive. Or the oppressed may engage in\nstrategic \u201crefusals to understand\u201d when such understanding\nwould conform to dominant constructions of their experience that\nundermine their agency (Pohlhaus 2011). Such work that draws attention\nto the complex roles of ignorance in our epistemic practices broadens\nthe range of epistemic values under consideration beyond the\nacquisition of truth to include consideration of how our ignorances\ncan at times be well placed. At the same time, it emphasizes the\nethical dimensions of the epistemic relationships with others that are\nso crucial to our knowing capacities.\n\n\nWhile there are various forms of ignorance to be investigated\n(Townley 2011), one that has occupied a good deal of feminist attention\nis \u201cinvested ignorance\u201d (Townley 2011) in which the\nignorance is \u201csystematically produced and sustained to\nmisrepresent reality in ways that not coincidentally sustain patterns\nof\u2026 privilege\u201d (Townley 2011, x). In their analyses of\ninvested ignorance, many feminists have built upon Charles\nMills\u2019s work on racial ignorance, in which he argues that whites\n(or other dominant groups) have a positive interest in misrepresenting\nthe world in ways that help support their dominant position (Mills\n1997, 2007). Mills conceptualizes whites as engaged in a kind of cognitive\ndysfunction that serves their purposes by preventing them from\nunderstanding the social relations of domination in which they are\nengaged, making it easier to maintain that domination. His work\nconnects closely with feminist standpoint theory in providing both an\nexplanation of the patterns of belief-forming practices that can result\nin an ignorance of the social relations of domination on behalf of the\nprivileged, and an explanation of the potential lack of motivation to\ncorrect such ignorance (Alcoff 2007).\n\n\nYet another line of investigation that has proved important for\nfeminist epistemologists concerns the mapping of the ways in which\nparticular culturally-embedded ignorances track the interests of\nmarginalized groups. For example, Nancy Tuana has examined the history\nof the science of female sexuality, arguing that structures of power\nhave played out in both constructing and maintaining the relative\nignorance of female sexuality compared with the knowledge of male\nsexuality (Tuana 2004). She has also argued that the women\u2019s health\nmovement of the 1970s that sought to make available to women knowledge\nof their bodies and expose those sexist and androcentric practices\nthat maintained an ignorance of their bodies is best understood as not\nonly a political resistance movement but an epistemological resistance\nmovement (Tuana 2006).  Given the feminist theme of the situated\nnature of knowing, feminists have argued that whatever knowledge is\nproduced, it is always both perspectival and limited. Work such as\nTuana\u2019s draws attention to the political forces that help direct the\nresearch and production of knowledge, shaping patterns of knowledge\nand ignorance.  Rather than simply focusing on the production of\nknowledge itself, an obvious question posed by feminists on such a\nsituated approach is: \u201cknowledge for whom?\u201d Issues of\nresponsibility concerning what kind of knowledge communities undertake\nto produce, and correspondingly what ignorance those same communities\nactively produce are unavoidable (Code 1991, 2006; Heldke\n2001). Whereas many epistemologists have noted that our epistemic\ngoals are best characterized not as the generation of truths per se,\nbut rather as the generation of significant truths (Kitcher 1993),\nfeminists working from a situated approach recognize that \u201cwhat\nis significant?\u201d can only be answered with reference to the\nquestions asked and the interests behind those questions (Anderson\n1995b). Feminists further note that differently located persons may\nhave quite different interests at stake concerning what questions need\nto be asked, what knowledge needs to be produced, and what ignorances\nmatter (Grasswick 2010). Questions then arise concerning to whom\nknowers take themselves to be accountable with respect to their\nchoices of knowledge and ignorance production (McHugh 2011; Code\n2011). For many feminist social epistemologists, the goal is to\ndevelop epistemic practices that don\u2019t simply generate an\nabundance of knowledge, but that generate sound and ethical patterns\nof knowledge and ignorance.\n\n\nThe development of epistemologies of ignorance has proved to be a\nfruitful framework through which feminists can articulate the\ncomplexities of the weaknesses of current (and past) epistemic\npractices and understand in detail the effects of power relations on\nthose practices. Recognizing the role of ignorance reframes their\nconception of epistemic goals, broadening them to include not just the\nacquisition of truths, but the development of reliable and significant\nknowledge for differently located people, with patterns of knowledge\nand ignorance that support healthy epistemic relations between\npeople.\n\n\nMany of the recent feminist analyses of epistemic injustice and\nepistemic ignorance combine to draw attention to another important\nfeature of our social epistemic relations: trust and\ntrustworthiness. Because of our epistemic dependence on each other,\ninquirers need to trust others for knowledge, and often must trust\nacross social locations. Structural features of epistemic injustice\nand invested ignorance create challenges for determining how to trust\nresponsibly (Grasswick 2014), and how to be a trustworthy knower for\nthose situated differently from oneself. Medina provides account of\nhow racial ignorance produces systematic distrust across racial lines\n(through racial insensitivity) and considers how one could become\naware of such insensitivities (Medina 2016). Recent work on implicit\nbias explores just how difficult it can be for a knower to become\naware of how they are perpetuating epistemic injustices (Brownstein\nand Saul 2016). How are we to respond to such challenging epistemic\nconditions? Feminists have taken different approaches. Daukas argues\nthat within social networks of inquiry, being trustworthy is a central\nvirtue (and requires being trustworthy in one\u2019s own inquiry, and being\na good judge of others\u2019 trustworthiness) (Daukas 2006). Yet\nFrost-Arnold argues that trustworthiness is more complex; in some\ncases, taking on the role of a trickster by betraying the trust of the\ndominant might be epistemically virtuous on the part of the\nmarginalized, when doing so disrupts the networks of trust that\nexclude the oppressed (Frost-Arnold 2014). Turning to the world of\nsocial media, Frost-Arnold also argues for the epistemic potential of\na strategy of \u201chopeful trust,\u201d wherein, in spite of the odds of\nexperiencing testimonial injustice and other wrongs, a marginalized\nperson posts about her interpretation of her experiences, in hopes of\nchallenging the ignorance of the dominant (Frost-Arnold 2016). These\nworks offer examples of how feminists tend to approach the role of\nepistemic trust and trustworthiness differently from other social\nepistemologists: by attending explicitly to the relevance of social\npositions and existing networks of trust wrought as they are with\nproblematic features of epistemic injustice and invested ignorance\nthat infect epistemic processes, and must be grappled with.\n4.3 Democratic Structures of Knowledge Production\n\n\nA third area of discussion in which feminists have directly\nconnected epistemic with social and ethical goals concerns the role of\ndemocratic structures in the production of knowledge. In part as a\nresponse to such challenges as epistemic injustice and the ways in\nwhich the production of ignorances helps support structures of\ndomination, feminists have developed normative remedies that include\nmore democratic epistemic institutions and practices. Several different\nlines of argument can be identified for why and how democratic\npractices can be epistemically beneficial.\n\n\nSome feminists have focused squarely on the internal democratic\nconditions of epistemic communities required for objectivity. For\nexample, Longino\u2019s social process-based idea of objectivity\nrequires a practice of open discussion and critical engagement between\nmembers of epistemic communities, in order to ensure that the knowledge\nproduced is objective in the sense of having withstood appropriate\ncritical scrutiny. Importantly, Longino includes conditions of tempered\nintellectual authority and uptake of criticism for the participants of\nepistemic communities (2002), arguing that objectivity can only be\nsuccessfully pursued in situations where knowers are respected for\ntheir epistemic contributions and not ignored or assigned less\ncredibility because of who they are. In a related vein, Elizabeth Anderson\n(1995c) argues explicitly that the aims of higher education demand that\nissues of justice and equality of respect within the academy be taken\nup as epistemic issues, securing the ability of all to contribute their\nideas to the public discourse and have those ideas taken seriously.\nKristina Rolin similarly points to the epistemic need for social and\ncultural norms within scientific communities that promote inclusive and\nresponsive dialogue, and worries about the distorting effects on the\ncredibility of women scientists operating within cultures of\nprofessional interaction that conflate masculine styles of presentation\nwith competence (Rolin 2002). Many have also drawn attention to the\nfact that the critical engagement called for by the likes of Longino\nand Anderson will only be epistemically effective if a diversity of\nperspectives are represented within that particular epistemic\ncommunity. Longino explicitly acknowledges the importance of diverse\nrepresentation in order to expose questionable background assumptions\nthat can be invisible when shared by a group of similarly situated\nknowers (Longino 2002). Others have examined in more detail the links\nbetween diversity in social situation and diversity in epistemic\nperspectives. For example, Kristen Intemann argues that the epistemic\nvalue of diversity comes from a diversity of experiences being\nrepresented at the table, not a diversity of values or interests\nper se (Intemann 2011). Still others have examined in detail\nthe role of \u201cchilly climate\u201d issues within epistemic\ncommunities (Wylie 2011), and the structural and motivational barriers\nto change that are present within academic institutions (Fehr 2011),\nboth factors which contribute to the difficulty of reaping the\nepistemic benefits of diversity within epistemic communities. These\narguments suggest that our epistemic projects are harmed when social\nrelations conspire to either exclude particular knowers from relevant\nepistemic communities, or more insidiously deny them the credibility\nand epistemic respect they deserve within those communities.\n\n\nOthers have argued that outside of specific epistemic communities\nthemselves, society-wide improvements in social justice are required so\nthat sexist and androcentric biases do not continue to weaken our\nscientific practices (Kourany 2010). Naomi Scheman has argued that\ninsofar as scientific communities and institutions fail to be\ntrustworthy from the perspective of marginalized groups who have\nexperienced a poor historical relationship with them, those\ninstitutions fail in achieving objectivity, given that the function of\nobjectivity is to rationally ground trust (Scheman 2001). According to\nsuch arguments, epistemic improvement requires improvement to the\nstructure of our social relations understood more broadly than just\ninside the epistemic communities themselves. Situations of oppression,\nand the marginalization of groups within society damage the epistemic\npotential of both specific epistemic communities and society at\nlarge.\n\n\nFinally, many feminist social epistemologists explicitly invoke\ndemocratic goals as guides for the direction of research. Arguments\nhere build upon the idea that that knowledge is limited, and cannot be\nassumed to serve the interests of everyone equally. Sandra Harding, for\nexample, calls for \u201cthe reinvention of sciences for the many to\nreplace sciences that are often only for the elite few\u201d (1991,\n312). Heidi Grasswick builds upon Scheman\u2019s line of reasoning\nconcerning the need for scientific institutions to be trustworthy from\nparticular social vantage points. She argues that among the\nrequirements for such trustworthiness, there must be available evidence\nthat scientific institutions are taking up at least some research\nquestions that are significant for the social group in question and\nproviding meaningful answers to those questions. Furthermore, she notes\nthat engagement and sound communication between scientific and\nvariously situated lay communities are required in order to establish\nthe necessary trusting relations that would allow for particularly\nsituated lay persons to responsibly rely on scientific institutions for\ntheir knowledge (Grasswick 2010). Broadening the scope beyond just\nscientific practices, Lorraine Code argues for a guiding ecological\nprinciple of cohabitability in epistemic decision-making\n(2006). Ultimately, she argues, we should select directions of research\nand methods of research that permit and foster our living well amongst\none another, clearly bringing an ethical dimension into epistemic\ndecision-making.\n\n\nIn various ways then, feminist social epistemologists have argued\nfor deep connections between democracy and the success of epistemic\npractices. They have attended to the effects of social relations\ninternal to epistemic communities, social relations external to those\ncommunities, and social relations between knowledge-producing\ncommunities and lay communities.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"RefCit\">References Cited</a>", "<a name=\"FurRea\">Further Readings</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"RefCit\">References Cited</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Addelson, Kathryn Pyne, 1983. \u201cThe Man of Professional Wisdom,\u201d\n<em>Discovering Reality: Feminist Perspectives on Epistemology,\nMetaphysics, Methodology, and the Philosophy of Science</em>, Sandra\nHarding and Merrill Hintikka (eds.), Dordrecht: D.
