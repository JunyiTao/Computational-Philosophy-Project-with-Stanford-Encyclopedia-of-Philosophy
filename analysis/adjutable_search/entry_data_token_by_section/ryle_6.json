    "main_text": "The Intellectualist Legend\n7. The Intellectualist Legend\n\nTo highlight the general difficulties with Cartesianism is only part\nof Ryle\u2019s destructive strategy. The other part is to show how\nlogical absurdities arise with one particular offshoot of the Official\nDoctrine: one he dubs \u201cthe intellectualist legend\u201d. This\ninvolves the type-error or category mistake of supposing that what\ndistinguishes certain performances from others that are perceptually\nsimilar (in one sense of \u2018perceptual\u2019) is the addition of\nsome non-perceptual feature. The Official Doctrine construes this\nfeature as a special mental\n accompaniment.[7]\n The intellectualist legend, accepting this construal of the Official\nDoctrine, says that intelligent or rational behaviour can be\naccommodated or explained by some sort of theoretical operations\ninvolving these hidden accompaniments. But if this is a mistake, it is\na big one; for it is made not only throughout various sub-branches of\nphilosophy but also in collaborating disciplines. (The idea, for\nexample, that intelligence involves physically realised,\n(non-introspectible) theoretical (computational) operations is one of\nthe founding blocks of the cognitive sciences.)\n\nThis picture of how rational abilities in general are to be explained,\nincluding the ability to speak a language, was called into question by\nRyle in a number of early papers (especially in 1946a, ostensibly\nreworked as the second chapter of 1949a, and in 1946b and 1950). It\nwas also called into question by Wittgenstein in his discussion of\nrules (Wittgenstein, \u00a7\u00a7143\u2013155 and 179\u2013202).\n\nIn broad brush-strokes, Ryle\u2019s argument-strategy against the\nsupposition that generally intelligent or rational abilities can be\nexplained in terms of prior theoretical operations (involving the\napprehension of the relevant truths) is to exhibit how the supposition\nleads to logically vicious regresses. Intelligent behaviours cannot be\nexplained, in general, by assuming that theoretical operations have\ngone on behind the scene, since those operations themselves can be\nintelligent or non-intelligent. The supposition that intelligent\nbehaviour always requires prior (or even contemporaneous) theoretical\noperations launches a vicious regress of theoretical operations. Thus,\nit must be allowed that some intelligent behaviour is not the outcome\nof prior theoretical operations.\n\nThe role of the rules, standards, or norms that govern our practices\nshould neither be exaggerated nor underestimated. For Ryle (as for\nWittgenstein), rules are codifications or distillations of normative\npractices that are already up and running. As Ryle aptly quips,\n\n[t]here were reasoners before Aristotle and strategists before\nClausewitz. The application of rules of reasoning and strategy did not\nhave to await the work of their codifiers. Aristotle and Clausewitz\nwere, in fact, only able to extract these rules, because they were\nalready being applied. (1946b, 233)\n\n\nThe crystallisation of performance-rules in rule-formulae is, in some\ncases, a product of studies in the methodology of the practices in\nwhich they have already been applied and not the condition of their\nbeing applied. In other words: there must be a way of applying a rule\nthat does not require the prior consultation of an expression of that\nrule.\n\nClose attention to the cases in which we credit someone for her\nperformance shows that it is often enough for her (merely) to have\nsatisfied certain criteria or for her performance to have lived up to\nthe relevant standard. Close attention to the cases in which we\nrequire not only that she satisfy certain criteria but also that she\napply the criteria by using an expression of a rule to guide her shows\nthat the latter is in fact a separate skill, which we only sometimes\n(but importantly not always) demand of the one we wish to credit for\nher\n performance.[8]\n\nThe ability to apply criteria in order to ensure that one\u2019s\nperformance is successful is like showing a ticket in order to ensure\none\u2019s right to travel by rail (1950, 239\u201340). It would be\na category mistake to imagine that the ticket itself plays a role in\nthe explanation of the train journey on the same level as the pistons,\nlevers, and tracks. So, too (we might add), would it be a category\nmistake to imagine that reasons, for example, play a role in the\nexplanation of action on (almost) the same level as the internal\nprocesses that explain (in a different sense) the body\u2019s\nmotions; or that meanings or understandings play a role in the\nexplanation of language use on (almost) the same level as the internal\nprocesses that explain (again, in a different sense) vocalisations.\nBut just this type of category error seems to be made by those who\nconstrue the relevant mental phenomena, including understanding, as\ninner causal\n events.[9]\n\nFor discussion of the importance of skill, drill, powers and\npropensities, see B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m and Gustafasson 2017. \n\nFor more discussion on some of the themes in this section, see the\nsupplement:\n\nSome Problems in Contemporary Work on Knowing-How and Knowing-That\n\n",
