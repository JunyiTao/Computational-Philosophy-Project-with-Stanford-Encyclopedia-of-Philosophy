Levels as a fragmentary and heuristic notion\n\nIn the wake of skeptical arguments against the levels concept, recent\nwork on the notion has sought to address the pessimistic appraisals\noutlined in the previous section by rejuvenating the discussion\nsurrounding levels. One key component in reestablishing the potential\nof levels for philosophical insight has been to address the gap\nbetween philosophical expectations placed upon the concept in\nskeptical treatments, and the usage dynamics informing scientific\napplications of the concept (Brooks 2021b; see also DiFrisco 2017 and\nBrooks, DiFrisco & Wimsatt 2021a).\n\nIn particular, philosophical expectations placed upon accounts of\nlevels tend to depart from scientific applications of the concept both\nin characterizing how the levels concept is used and in the\nmotivations behind applying the concept in scientific contexts. This\nis especially visible in the way that levels are conceptualized by\ncritics. For instance, Potochnik characterizes the objectionable\nconsequences of the levels concept as stemming from \u201cthe very\nidea\u201d of levels (2017: 170), where this \u201cvery idea\u201d\ntakes the concept to impose (i) universality of composition, (ii)\nuniform relations between putative levels, and (iii) total\ndiscreteness of level-bound units (2017: 170; see also Potochnik &\nMcGill 2012: 126). Similarly, Thalos claims that to even postulate a\nleveled ontology is to be committed to a reductionist \u201cmaster\nontology\u201d grounded in physics from which all other higher levels\nderive (2013: 7).\n\nBoth of these characterizations rest on attributions to the levels\nconcept stemming from philosophical sources rather than scientific\nusage of the concept. For one thing, Potochnik\u2019s idea of levels\nseems to presume a layer-cake conception, an account that has few\ncontemporary advocates and whose fidelity to science has arguably\nalways at least been questionable. Likewise, the commitment to a\nreductionist ontology purported by Thalos rests decidedly on the\nfurther postulation of reductionist physicalism, a stance to which the\nlevels concept is at best neutral (see\n section 6).\n Though these sources for making levels intelligible as an object of\ncriticism may enjoy intuitive appeal widely in play in general\nphilosophy of science and philosophy of mind, it is plausible that\nassessing the merits (and demerits) of the concept requires extraction\nfrom base intuition and exposure to further scientific-philosophical\nscrutiny (Brooks, DiFrisco, & Wimsatt 2021a).\n\nFor these reasons, efforts to rejuvenate levels and their significance\nhave turned to different sources to enable scientific input into the\nconceptualization of levels. One important consequence of this has\nbeen the rejection of any neat and tidy definition or unitary account\nof levels, instead treating the concept within multiple facets of\nreconstruction that scientific usage engenders. That is, engaging with\nthe notion is seen as a widely open-ended endeavor (Brooks 2021a).\n\nOne such front of approaches to levels focuses on the roles of the\nconcept in scientific reasoning. For instance, Brooks and Eronen\n(2018) locate a heuristic element within usage of levels of\norganization. In this approach, instead of focusing primarily on what\nlevels are ontologically speaking, or attempting to give a unitary\ndefinition of levels, the focus is to recover first the significance\nattributed to levels when applied in science (and parts of philosophy\nof biology). In particular, depicting biological systems requires\nemphasizing some details over others, as incorporating all details of\nan investigated system is not possible due to the cognitive and\nphysical constraints placed on human agents (in line with the focus on\nheuristic reasoning). Thus, scientific uses of levels involve\ndescriptive abstractions figuring into the decisions researchers make\nin selecting features of a system intended for the attending analysis.\nA second use Brooks and Eronen identify concerns the postulation of\nlevels as guiding scientific inquiry in that different putative\nlevels, though perhaps not well-characterized at the outset, serve as\npoints of departure for new fields of inquiry in laying out landscapes\nof problems and questions that lie in front of these fields (such as\nsystems biology in the 2000s). Eronen (2021) identifies a further\nheuristic in the basic idea that in levels of organization\n\u201csimilar things are composed of things that are similar to one\nanother\u201d, which may often work as an abstraction. For example,\nboth proteins and genes (at a higher level), which are similar in\nimportant ways, are composed of monomers such amino acids and\nnucleotides (at a lower level), which are again similar to one another\nin important ways.\n\nThis being said, the heuristic approach offers an incomplete account\nof levels, an intentional feature meant to invite further work on the\nnotion. The heuristic approach thus seeks to capture some minimal\nfeatures that a more committed body of work should account for. A core\nmotivation of this approach is to construct a rapprochement between\nadvocates of the levels concept and more skeptical theorists (see,\nhowever, Potochnik 2021 for criticism of the heuristic approach).\nParticularly, supporters of the heuristic approach argue that a more\nnuanced appraisal of the levels concept aids to reveal its flexibility\nand usefulness in science. Most especially, it emphasizes that, like\nother heuristics, the concept may work in some contexts but not in\nothers. Such scattered records of success, failure, and neutral\naccomplishments are in turn \u201cmundane to scientific concepts in\ngeneral\u201d (Brooks & Eronen 2018: 41).\n\nUsing the heuristic appraisal of levels as a springboard, a more\nsystematic reconstruction of the levels concept in scientific\nreasoning points to a \u201cfragmentary approach\u201d whereby more\noverarching usage profiles begin to take shape. Brooks (2021a) for\ninstance articulates two such profiles associated with the levels\nconcept in scientific usage. One of these profiles identifies the\nlevels concept as a tool (sensu Griffiths & Stotz 2008;\nFeest 2010) that scientists use to, for example, construct material\ninferences in specific experimental systems and to aid in providing\nprojectibility to these inferences by conferring generality to the\nstructures and processes involved. This profile of usage\narguably\u00a0captures practical scientific work operative in research\narticles published for specialist researchers. A second usage profile\nassociated with levels appears as a kind of \u201cdoctrinal\u201d\nnotion in the vein of cell theory or the germ theory of disease. This\nprofile draws its inspiration from the notion of doctrine, in the\nsense of something that is widely taught or adhered to, and is visible\nin scientific textbooks (see\n section 6.7)\n and in broad statements of position by grant-funding agencies and\nmajor theoretical works in biology. That is, the notion of levels of\norganization comprises a core theoretical component in the edifice of\nbiology in serving to introduce or advocate for a basic view of\nbiological science. Both of these usage profiles, seen as tool and\ndoctrine, complement each other in conferring (i) fine-grained content\nto the concept in specific instances (tool) and (ii) general warrant\nto the notion as an established confluence of insights acquired\nthroughout history (doctrine). Moreover, both suggest a unifying\nrationale to the notion, identified in its potential ability to\nstructure scientific problems (Brooks 2021b).\n",
