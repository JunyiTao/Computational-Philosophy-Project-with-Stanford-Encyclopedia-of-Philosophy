    "main_text": "Dialectic and language\n2. Dialectic and language\n\nVives\u2019 career as a leading northern European humanist starts\nwith the publication in 1519 of In pseudodialecticos, a\nsatirical diatribe in which he voices his opposition to scholastic\nlogic on several counts. He follows in the footsteps of earlier\nhumanists such as Lorenzo Valla (1406\u201357) and Rudolph Agricola\n(1443\u201385), who set about to replace the scholastic curriculum,\nbased on syllogistic and disputation, with a treatment of logic\noriented toward the use of the topics, a technique of verbal\nassociation aiming at the invention and organization of material for\narguments, and persuasion. Vives\u2019 severe censure of scholastic\nlogic derived from his own unhappy experience with the scholastic\ncurriculum at Paris. Therefore, as he himself emphasized, no one could\naccuse him of \u201ccondemning it because he did not understand\nit\u201d (Opera omnia, 1964, III, 38; all quotations below\nare from this edition). Erasmus wrote to More that no one was better\nsuited for the battle against the dialecticians, in whose ranks he had\nserved for many years.\n\nThe main targets of Vives\u2019 criticism are Peter of Spain\u2019s\nSummule logicales, a work dating from the thirteenth century\nbut which still held an important place in the university curriculum,\nand the theory of the property of terms, a semantic theory dealing\nwith properties of linguistic expressions such as signification, i.e.,\nthe meaning of a word regardless of context, and supposition, i.e.,\nthe meaning of a word within the context of its use in a proposition.\nHe repudiates the use of technical jargon, accessible only to a narrow\ngroup of professionals, and maintains that if scholastic logicians\nmade an effort to speak plainly and according to common usage, many of\ntheir conundrums would disappear. Instead, they choose to fritter away\ntheir ingenuity on logically ambiguous propositions known as\nsophismata. Vives provides many examples of such\npropositions, which in his view make no sense whatever and are\ncertainly of no use. Many of these, such as \u201cSome animal is not\nman, therefore some man is not animal\u201d (III, 54), were standard\nscholastic examples. Others, such as \u201cOnly any non-donkey\nc of any man except Socrates and another c belonging\nto this same man begins contingently to be black\u201d (III, 40), are\nintended as a mockery of the futile quibbling he associated with\nscholastic method. Since dialectic, like rhetoric and grammar, deals\nwith language, its rules should be adapted to the rules of ordinary\nlanguage; but with what language, he asks, have these propositions to\ndo? Moreover, dialectic should not be learned for its own sake, but as\na support for the other arts; therefore, no more effort should be\nspent on it than is absolutely necessary. Vives\u2019 criticism is\nalso informed by ethical concerns and the demand for a method that\nwould be of use in everyday life rather than in academic disputations.\nIn contrast to the standard interpretation, it has been argued that\nIn pseudodialecticos is not a serious refutation of\nscholasticism, but rather a sophistical exercise replete with\nfallacious arguments, whose purpose is to teach a valuable lesson in\nscholastic dialectic challenging the reader to detect the many logical\nfallacies that it contains. According to this interpretation, In\npseudodialecticos offers no serious arguments against scholastic\nlogical theory or principles (see Perreiah, 2014, ch.4). \n\nA more detailed criticism can be found in De disciplinis of\n1531. This encyclopedic treatise is divided into three parts: De\ncausis corruptarum artium (On the Causes of the Corruption of\nthe Arts), seven books devoted to a thoroughgoing critique of the\nfoundations of contemporary education; De tradendis\ndisciplinis (On Handing Down the Disciplines), five\nbooks in which Vives outlines his program for educational reform; and\nfive shorter treatises De artibus (On the Arts),\ndealing mainly with logic and metaphysics. These five treatises\ninclude De prima philosophia (On First Philosophy),\na compendium of Aristotelian physics and metaphysics from a Christian\npoint of view; De censura veri (On the Assessment of\nTruth), a discussion of the proposition and the forms of\nargumentation; De explanatione cuiusque essentiae (On the\nExplanation of Each Essence); De instrumento\nprobabilitatis (On the Instrument of Probability), which\ncontains a theory of knowledge, as well as a detailed account of\ndialectical invention; and De disputatione (On\nDisputation), in which he discusses non-formal proofs. In these\ntreatises, Vives not only continues the trends in humanist dialectic\ninitiated by Valla and Agricola, but also displays a familiarity with\nphilosophical technicalities that was unusual among humanists and that\nreveals the more traditionally Aristotelian aspects of his thought.\nHis appraisal of the Aristotelian corpus is summarised in Censura\nde Aristotelis operibus (Assessment of Aristotle\u2019s\nWorks, 1538). A posthumously published treatise entitled\nDialectices libri quatuor (Four Books of Dialectic,\n1550) appears to be a youthful work that Vives evidently did not\nconsider suitable for publication.\n\nVives\u2019 criticism of scholastic logic hinges on a profound\nanalysis of the arts of discourse. For him, the supremacy of the\nsermo communis (ordinary discourse) over the abstract\nlanguage of metaphysics is indisputable. Philosophy ought not to\ninvent the language and subject of its own specific investigation (VI,\n140). In De causis corruptarum artium, he writes:\n\u201cenraged against nature, about which they know nothing, the\ndialecticians have constructed another one for themselves\u2014that\nis to say, the nature of formalities, individual natures\n(ecceitates), realities, relations, Platonic ideas and other\nmonstrosities which cannot be understood even by those who have\ninvented them\u201d (VI, 190\u20131). Instead of the formal language\nof the dialecticians, which he found completely unsuited to interpret\nreality, he proposes the less rigorous but more concrete universe of\neveryday communication, which answers all our practical needs and aims\nto provide a knowledge that is useful.\n",
