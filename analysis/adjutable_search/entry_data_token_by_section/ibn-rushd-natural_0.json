    "main_text": "Place and Division of Natural Philosophy\n1. Place and Division of Natural Philosophy\n\nNatural philosophy, according to Averroes (following Aristotle),\nembraces the study of all sensible beings that undergo change and\npossess the principle of motion and rest in themselves (LC 1G\nProemium). The philosophy of natural beings divides into various\nbranches, for instance, psychology or astronomy. Physics is the first\nand most important branch and since it is scientific knowledge physics\nhas to inquire about causes, and its distinctive causes are \u201cthe\ncauses common to all natural entities\u201d (LC 1G). Averroes follows\nAristotle and distinguishes four causes\u2014matter, form, purpose\nand agent\u2014in all natural beings. Physics extends the inquiry on\nmatter and agent to their outmost limits, that is, Prime Matter and\nthe First Mover. Another part of philosophy deals with primary form\nand first purpose, and this is metaphysics. Averroes adds other\naspects to the subject matter of physics, he calls them\n\u201caccessories\u201d, \u201cnecessary concomitants\u201d\n(law\u0101\u1e25iq, consequentes) or properties\ncommon to all natural beings, namely place, time and the like (LC 1GH;\nMC 434AE).\n\nHowever, an important distinction between Aristotle and Averroes is\nfound in the latter\u2019s approach to the value of natural\nphilosophy. Averroes follows the arrangement that Andronicus made of\nAristotle\u2019s writings and, therefore, after the propaedeutic\nstudy of logic, the study of philosophy begins with the physics in the\nproper sense of the term. In addition, he remarks that physics belongs\nto the theoretical dimension of philosophy and that philosophy has a\npractical dimension too, namely ethics. The practical sciences have\ntaught that \u201cthe perfect acquisition of the theoretical sciences\nbrings man to his ultimate perfection and entire essence\u201d (LC\n 1H)[1].\n It is the only way man can attain true happiness.\n\nThe natural order requires man to cultivate the ethical virtues,\njustice, temperance, courage, etc., after he really possesses the\nspeculative virtues. Averroes adduces Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019s\npreface to his commentary of the Physics to support his\nstatement. Alexander\u2019s commentary is lost and, although Marwan\nRashed has published the extant scholia of it, they are limited to\nexplaining Books IV\u2013VIII (Rashed 2011) and no hint concerning\nthe content of the preface is given. Our only source is therefore\nAverroes\u2019 account:\n\nAlexander explained there the reason why the natural order requires\nman to be morally virtuous in order that he becomes intellectually\nperfect. Once the sage is aware of the infinity of time and his\nindividual finiteness, he has no fear, and moreover, once he knows\nthat death afflicts him because of his bodily component, \u201cex\nnecessitate materiae\u201d (LC 2A) and that he is not going to\nbe deprived of the intellectual perfection he has acquired, he has no\nfear of death, and some sages, like Socrates, have even preferred\ndeath to life because his country did not allow him to go the way of\nperfection.\n\n\nThe sage wants to be morally virtuous because he knows that both\nvirtues, moral and theoretical, are inseparable. He knows the nature\nof justice existing in the substance of [created] beings and he\naspires \u201cto be similar to this nature and to acquire its\nform\u201d. (LC 2C; cf. Harvey 1985: 66: 21\u201323)\n\n\nSimilar views are expressed in Averroes\u2019 Short Commentary:\nNatural philosophy has a twofold dimension: it is knowledge of the\nmaterial world and a speculative science but it is also essential in\ncontributing to the happiness of those who possess this knowledge. (SC\nVariant reading to 7:8\u20138:12), although he later replaced the\ntext with another of technical character.\n",
