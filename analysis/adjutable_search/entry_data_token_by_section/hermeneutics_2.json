    "main_text": "Interpretive Experience || Against Foundationalism\n1.2 Against Foundationalism\n\nHermeneutics may be said to involve a positive attitude\u2014at once\nepistemic, existential, and even ethical and political\u2014toward\nthe finitude of human understanding, that is, the fact that our\nunderstanding is time and again bested by the things we wish to grasp,\nthat what we understand remains ineluctably incomplete, even partial,\nand open to further consideration. In hermeneutics, the concern is\ntherefore not primarily to establish norms or methods which would\npurport to help us overcome or eradicate aspects of such finitude,\nbut, instead, to recognize the consequences of our limits.\nAccordingly, hermeneutics affirms that we must remain ever vigilant\nabout how common wisdom and prejudices inform\u2014and can\ndistort\u2014our perception and judgment, that even the most\nestablished knowledge may be in need of reconsideration, and that this\nfinitude of understanding is not simply a regrettable fact of the\nhuman condition but, more importantly, that this finitude is itself an\nimportant opening for the pursuit of new and different meaning. In\nview of this positive attitude toward the finitude of human\nunderstanding, it is no surprise that hermeneutics opposes\nfoundationalism.\n\nHermeneutics opposes what can be described as the\n\u2018vertical\u2019 picture of knowledge at issue in\nepistemological foundationalism, focusing, instead, on the\n\u2018circularity\u2019 at issue in understanding. In\nepistemological foundationalism, our body of beliefs (or at least our\njustified beliefs) are sometimes said to have the structure of an\nedifice. Some beliefs are distinguished as foundations, ultimately,\nbecause they depend on no further beliefs for their justification;\nother beliefs are distinguished as founded, in that their\njustification depends on the foundational beliefs (Steup and Neta\n2015, Section 4.1). This is a \u2018vertical\u2019 picture of human\nknowledge in that new beliefs build on established beliefs; new\nbeliefs are justified on the basis of already justified beliefs, and\nthese beliefs, in turn, are justified by still other beliefs, all the\nway down to the foundational beliefs. Inquiry, then, is an\n\u2018upward\u2019 pursuit, one that adds new \u2018floors\u2019\nto the edifice of what we already know.\n",
