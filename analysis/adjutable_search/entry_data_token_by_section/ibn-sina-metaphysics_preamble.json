    "main_text": "\n\nFor Avicenna (Ibn S\u012bn\u0101) metaphysics is a science\n(\u02bfilm), i.e., a perfectly rationally established\ndiscipline that allows human reason to achieve an authentic\nunderstanding of the inner structure of the world. Metaphysics is the\nscience of being qua being and therefore the science that\nexplains every being. In his interpretation, Avicenna fuses\nthe Aristotelian tradition, which he intends to renew (Gutas 2014),\nwith the Neo-Platonic idea of emanation, on which he builds his\nsystem: metaphysics thus includes theology, cosmology and angelology,\nand provides a foundation for physics, psychology, prophetology and\neschatology. Indeed, metaphysics even demonstrates \u201cthe\nprinciples of the particular sciences\u201d that investigate\n\u201cthe states of particular existent things\u201d\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 2, 14, 18\u201315, 7) and are\nsubordinate to it (Bertolacci 2006: Ch. 7). So metaphysics is\n\u201cfirst\u201d and \u201cat the head\u201d of all sciences\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 3, 18, 14\u201317; Houser 1999;\nLizzini 2005) and is universal not only because it concerns being\nqua being (instead of just some aspects of it), but also\nbecause it comprehends reality\u2014and the system of knowledge this\nimplies\u2014as a whole (instead of just some portions of it).\n\nIn this article, which has reference mainly, but not exclusively, to\nthe Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t of Kit\u0101b\nal-\u0160if\u0101\u02be (known in English as the\nMetaphysics of the Book of the Healing or of the\nBook of the Cure), I shall start\u2014after introducing\nAvicenna\u2019s sources\u2014with a brief discussion of the status\nof metaphysics as a science, and then illustrate Avicenna\u2019s\nanalysis of existence and the theology that arises from it. Thereafter\nI shall focus on Avicenna\u2019s theory of emanation, highlighting\nits essential aspects.\n",
