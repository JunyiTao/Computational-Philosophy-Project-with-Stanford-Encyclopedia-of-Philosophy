    "main_text": "Logics of discovery after the context distinction || Discovery as abduction\n6.1 Discovery as abduction\n\nOne argument, elaborated prominently by Norwood R. Hanson, is that the\nact of discovery\u2014here, the act of suggesting a new\nhypothesis\u2014follows a distinctive logical pattern, which is\ndifferent from both inductive logic and the logic of\nhypothetico-deductive reasoning. The special logic of discovery is the\nlogic of abductive or \u201cretroductive\u201d inferences (Hanson\n1958). The argument that it is through an act of abductive inferences\nthat plausible, promising scientific hypotheses are devised goes back\nto C.S. Peirce. This version of the logic of discovery characterizes\nreasoning processes that take place before a new hypothesis\nis ultimately justified. The abductive mode of reasoning that leads to\nplausible hypotheses is conceptualized as an inference beginning with\ndata or, more specifically, with surprising or anomalous\nphenomena.\n\nIn this view, discovery is primarily a process of explaining anomalies\nor surprising, astonishing phenomena. The scientists\u2019 reasoning\nproceeds abductively from an anomaly to an explanatory hypothesis in\nlight of which the phenomena would no longer be surprising or\nanomalous. The outcome of this reasoning process is not one single\nspecific hypothesis but the delineation of a type of hypotheses that\nis worthy of further attention (Hanson 1965: 64). According to Hanson,\nthe abductive argument has the following schematic form (Hanson 1960:\n104):\n\nSome surprising, astonishing phenomena p1,\np2, p3 \u2026 are\nencountered.\nBut p1, p2,\np3 \u2026 would not be surprising were an\nhypothesis of H\u2019s type to obtain. They would follow as\na matter of course from something like H and would be\nexplained by it.\nTherefore there is good reason for elaborating an hypothesis of\ntype H\u2014for proposing it as a possible hypothesis from whose\nassumption p1, p2,\np3 \u2026 might be explained.\n\n\nDrawing on the historical record, Hanson argues that several important\ndiscoveries were made relying on abductive reasoning, such as\nKepler\u2019s discovery of the elliptic orbit of Mars (Hanson 1958).\nIt is now widely agreed, however, that Hanson\u2019s reconstruction\nof the episode is not a historically adequate account of\nKepler\u2019s discovery (Lugg 1985). More importantly, while there is\ngeneral agreement that abductive inferences are frequent in both\neveryday and scientific reasoning, these inferences are no longer\nconsidered as logical inferences. Even if one accepts\nHanson\u2019s schematic representation of the process of identifying\nplausible hypotheses, this process is a \u201clogical\u201d process\nonly in the widest sense whereby the term \u201clogical\u201d is\nunderstood as synonymous with \u201crational\u201d. Notably, some\nphilosophers have even questioned the rationality of abductive\ninferences (Koehler 1991; Brem and Rips 2000).\n\nAnother argument against the above schema is that it is too\npermissive. There will be several hypotheses that are explanations for\nphenomena p1, p2,\np3 \u2026, so the fact that a particular\nhypothesis explains the phenomena is not a decisive criterion for\ndeveloping that hypothesis (Harman 1965; see also Blackwell 1969).\nAdditional criteria are required to evaluate the hypothesis yielded by\nabductive inferences.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that the schema of abductive reasoning\ndoes not explain the very act of conceiving a hypothesis or\nhypothesis-type. The processes by which a new idea is first\narticulated remain unanalyzed in the above schema. The schema focuses\non the reasoning processes by which an exploratory hypothesis is\nassessed in terms of its merits and promise (Laudan 1980; Schaffner\n1993).\n\nIn more recent work on abduction and discovery, two notions of\nabduction are sometimes distinguished: the common notion of abduction\nas inference to the best explanation (selective abduction) and\ncreative abduction (Magnani 2000, 2009). Selective abduction\u2014the\ninference to the best explanation\u2014involves selecting a\nhypothesis from a set of known hypotheses. Medical diagnosis\nexemplifies this kind of abduction. Creative abduction, by contrast,\ninvolves generating a new, plausible hypothesis. This happens, for\ninstance, in medical research, when the notion of a new disease is\narticulated. However, it is still an open question whether this\ndistinction can be drawn, or whether there is a more gradual\ntransition from selecting an explanatory hypothesis from a familiar\ndomain (selective abduction) to selecting a hypothesis that is\nslightly modified from the familiar set and to identifying a more\ndrastically modified or altered assumption.\n\nAnother recent suggestion is to broaden Peirce\u2019s original\naccount of abduction and to include not only verbal information but\nalso non-verbal mental representations, such as visual, auditory, or\nmotor representations. In Thagard\u2019s approach, representations\nare characterized as patterns of activity in mental populations (see\nalso\n section 9.3\n below). The advantage of the neural account of human reasoning is\nthat it covers features such as the surprise that accompanies the\ngeneration of new insights or the visual and auditory representations\nthat contribute to it. Surprise, for instance, could be characterized\nas resulting from rapid changes in activation of the node in a neural\nnetwork representing the \u201csurprising\u201d element (Thagard and\nStewart 2011). If all mental representations can be characterized as\npatterns of firing in neural populations, abduction can be analyzed as\nthe combination or \u201cconvolution\u201d (Thagard) of patterns of\nneural activity from disjoint or overlapping patterns of activity\n(Thagard 2010).\n",
