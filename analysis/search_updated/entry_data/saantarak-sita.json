    "preamble": "\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\n (725\u2013788)[1]\n was one of the most important and pivotal thinkers in the history of\nIndian and Tibetan Buddhist\n philosophy.[2]\n His contributions to Buddhist thought were particularly noteworthy\ndue to his historical position as one of the later Indian interpreters\nof the Madhyamaka thought of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (ca.\n1st\u20132nd c.). This was an historical position which allowed him\nto consider many important developments (both inside and outside the\nMadhyamaka tradition) that preceded\n him.[3]\n The central claim of the Madhyamaka School is that all phenomena are\nempty (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) of any intrinsic\nnature, unchanging essence, or absolute mode of being. This was the\ncentral idea in \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s thought as well,\nhowever, he was a commentator on both N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and\nDharmak\u012brti in equal measure. In fact,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita attempted to integrate the\nanti-essentialism of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna with the\nlogico-epistemological thought of Dign\u0101ga (ca. 6th c.)\nand Dharmak\u012brti (ca. 7th c.) along with facets of\n Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra[4]\n thought into one internally consistent, yet fundamentally Madhyamaka\nsystem. His innovative integration of facets of the three into a\nMadhyamaka framework of analysis are exemplary of the unique fruits\nwhich benefit from his historical local. The synthesis of these three\nmajor movements in Indian Buddhist philosophy was perhaps his most\nimportant contribution, among many, to the Indian Buddhist\nphilosophical tradition. This synthesis, which was also taken up by\nhis disciples (important philosophers in their own right) such as\nKamala\u015b\u012bla (740\u2013795) and to a lesser extent,\nHaribhadra (ca. 8th c.), has been characterized as the last\nmajor development in Indian Buddhist philosophy.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was a dynamic thinker and a scholar with\nboth breadth and depth of knowledge of the Indian philosophical\ntraditions. He encouraged his readers to actively engage with a host\nof non-Buddhist and Buddhist philosophical positions as they ascended\na sort of hierarchy of philosophical views, a hierarchy that\u2014in\nhis opinion\u2014culminates in the Madhyamaka view.\n\nHowever, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s contribution to Buddhist\nphilosophy as a whole did not stop in India. He made two trips to\nTibet and ultimately spent the last fifteen years of his life there.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was one of the most influential figures\nin the early dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet, founding the first\nBuddhist monastery at Samy\u00e9 (bsam yas), serving as its\nfirst abbot, ordaining the first seven Tibetan monks (Tib. sad mi\nmi bdun), and establishing a system of rigorous philosophical\nstudy based upon the traditions of learning at the great Indian\nBuddhist monastic universities such as N\u0101land\u0101 and\nVikrama\u015b\u012bla. In affect, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (and\nlater, his disciple Kamala\u015b\u012bla) taught Tibetans how to do\nphilosophy. He introduced Tibetans to a plethora of Indian\nphilosophical views, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, and taught them\nhow to study, critically analyze, and meditate upon these ideas.\nSeveral important qualities of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s\nthought that were unique to him in India, became a fully integrated\nmodus operandi of philosophy in Tibet including his dynamic\nengagement with competing philosophical views and his integration of\nMadhyamaka and logico-epistemological thought.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s works were studied among early\nTibetan monastic institutions, and his\nMadhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra (MA), along with\nKamala\u015b\u012bla\u2019s Madhyamak\u0101loka, and\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha\u2019s Satyadvayavibha\u1e45ga were\nknown as \u201cthe teachings of the Easterners\u201d (Tib. shar\nba dag) because these three authors were from Bengal. In this\nway, his influence impacted the spectrum of Tibetan philosophical\nliterature, from the earliest philosophical doxographies (Skt.\nsiddh\u0101nta, Tib. grub mtha\u2019) such as Yeshe\nDe\u2019s (ca. 8th c.) Distinguishing the Views\n(lta ba khyad par) to the commentaries and treatises of\nnumerous prestigious indigenous Tibetan philosophers such as Ngok\nLoden Sherap (rngog blo ldan shes rab) (1059\u20131109),\nChapa Ch\u00f6kyi Seng\u00e9 (phwya pa chos kyi seng ge)\n(1109\u20131169), Sakya Pandita (sa skya\npa\u1e47\u1e0dita) (1182\u20131251), Chomden Rikpai Raldri\n(bcom ldan rig pa\u2019i ral gri) (1227\u20131305),\nTsongkhapa (tsong kha pa) (1357\u20131419) and Mipham Gyatso\n(mi pham rgya mtsho) (1846\u20131912).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s Madhyamaka Thought\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is probably best known as one of the\ngreat Indian Madhyamaka commentators. His thought in this regard has\nseveral features that make it unique including: his integration of\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra thought, his integration of Buddhist\nlogico-epistemological (pram\u0101\u1e47a) developments\n(discussed below), and his dynamic engagement with other Buddhist and\nnon-Buddhist views (discussed below). His Madhyamaka view is most\nclearly and succinctly articulated in his text\nMadhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra (The Ornament of the\nMiddle Way, hereafter, MA) and his own commentary on that text,\nMadhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101rav\u1e5btti (The\nAuto-Commentary on The Ornament of the Middle Way, hereafter,\n MAV).[5]\n1.1 The Two Truths: Ultimate Truths\n\nA presentation of the two truths is a standard way by which Madhyamaka\nphilosophers explain their views on the ontological status of\nphenomena. It is seen as the most effective method for coursing a\n\u201cmiddle way\u201d between the philosophical extremes of\nasserting the absolute existence of phenomena on the one hand, and the\nnon-existence of them on the other. Thus, M\u0101dhyamikas will\nroutinely claim that phenomena lack a certain mode of existence\nultimately, but claim that such phenomena, or objects of knowledge,\nmaintain another mode conventionally. Virtually all Indian Madhyamaka\nphilosophers will claim, in some detail, that an ultimate truth is an\nobject\u2019s emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), or lack of\nhaving a truly existent essence or intrinsic nature. This claim, which\nruns the danger of leading to nihilism, is then tempered to some\ndegree by claims about the conventional mode of existence of those\nphenomena. Though phenomena do not ultimately exist, they do exist\nconventionally. The precise way in which individual Madhyamaka\nthinkers define and describe these two truths gets at the core of what\nmakes each of these important thinkers unique.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is famous for presenting his views on\nultimate truths by way of one of the most famous Buddhist\nphilosophical arguments on the ontological status of phenomena, the\nneither-one-nor-many argument (Skt. ek\u0101nekaviyogahetu,\nTib. gcig du bral gyi tan tshigs).\n1.2 The Two Truths: The Neither-One-Nor-Many Argument\n\nThe first two-thirds of MA comprise what is perhaps the most\nwell-known rendering of the neither-one-nor-many argument, one of the\nkey philosophical arguments used by Madhyamaka philosophers to\nestablish the emptiness, or lack of an inherent nature, in phenomena.\nIt is by way of this argument and his summary that\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita offers his presentation of the two\ntruths, ultimate truth (param\u0101rthasatya) and\nconventional truth (sa\u1e43v\u1e5btisatya). The two truths\nare not only the primary means by which M\u0101dhyamika philosophers\npresent their positions on ontology, but form the ground upon which\nissues of epistemology and logic are often discussed as well. The\nneither-one-nor-many argument is most succinctly presented in the\nfirst stanza of MA when he writes:\n\nThese entities, as asserted by our own [Buddhist schools] and other\n[non-Buddhist schools], have no inherent nature at all because in\nreality they have neither a singular nor manifold nature, like a\nreflection\n (pratibimbavat).[6]\n\n\nThe point that \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is attempting to make here\nis that no phenomena, including those which his philosophical rivals\nhave claimed to have an inherently existent essence or nature, in fact\ndo have such a nature. The reason they cannot have such a nature,\naccording to the argument, is that they have neither a truly singular\nnature (ekasvabh\u0101va), nor a truly manifold nature\n(anekasvabh\u0101va), the two being exhaustive of all\npossibilities for entities that have a real nature.\n\nOver the course of the next sixty stanzas in his ninety-seven stanza\ntext, MA, and accompanying auto-commentary, MAV,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita puts all those phenomena asserted by his\nBuddhist and non-Buddhist philosophical opponents to the test of the\nneither-one-nor-many reasoning. He begins by examining each instance\nin which some phenomena is asserted to be of a truly singular nature.\nThrough an analysis that reveals that such phenomena must have parts\nand thus could not be truly singular, he makes his way through all\nsuch cases current in late eighth century Indian philosophical\ndiscourse. For example, he begins his application of the argument with\nan analysis of the claim made by the non-Buddhist S\u0101\u1e43khya\nschool that there is a Fundamental Nature (Prak\u1e5bti) or\ncreator god which is the permanent, uncaused, unobstructed absolute\ncause of all phenomena and which is of a truly singular nature. He\nargues in the second stanza of MA:\n\nPermanent, efficacious entities are not themselves singular because\nthey contribute to the production of successive effects. If each\nsuccessive effect is distinct, then [the argument in favor of]\npermanent efficacious entities [that are truly singular]\n degenerates.[7]\n\n\nAccording to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, true singularity would be\nan absurd quality to claim for something which is permanent and has\nthe ability to contribute to the periodic production of successive\neffects. If that were the case, there must be a part of the causal\nentity in moment #1 which contributes to the production of a seed, for\nexample, a part in moment #2 which contributes to the production of\nthe sprout, and a part in moment #3 which contributes to the\nproduction of a flower. Since the Fundamental Nature is described as\nthe sole cause of the periodic arising of all effects, it must have\nall these parts, and more. It must have parts related with every\nentity for which it is a cause. The Fundamental Nature must include\nparts that cause entities to exist in one moment and parts that cause\nthem to cease to exist or transform into something else in another.\nThat which causes a seed to exist in moment #1 must have at least some\nquality or qualities that distinguish it from that which causes a\nsprout to exist in moment #2. At a bare minimum, his opponent must be\nforced to admit parts to such a Fundamental Nature. Something with\nmanifold parts cannot, by definition, be truly singular.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita thus considers that the application of\nthis sort of reasoning undermines the existence of such a truly\nsingular Fundamental Nature, as described in the S\u0101\u1e43khya\nsystem since it is illogical for there to be a permanent, truly\nsingular, unobstructed cause of the successive effects of the manifold\nworld. Arguments regarding the irrationality of asserting its\npermanence and those regarding its contradictions with our experience\nof causality in the world, are supplied in his own MAV on the above\nverse to strengthen his rejection of the notion of such a Fundamental\nNature.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is not only critical of his non-Buddhist\nphilosophical opponents however. The bulk of the argument is addressed\ntoward the views of philosophical opponents within in his own larger\nBuddhist camp that he feels have made errors in interpretation and\nlogic. For example, he dedicates a lengthy portion of the\nneither-one-nor-many argument to criticisms of a variety of Buddhist\nclaims about the true singularity of consciousness made by both\nBuddhists associated with the Sautr\u0101ntika schools and those\nassociated with the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra schools. In a\nvariety of ways, proponents of these schools claim that consciousness\nis truly singular and yet can be a knower of a multiplicity of\nobjects. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, such claims are fraught\nwith errors in logic. If consciousness knows a multiplicity of\nobjects, then it must not be singular by definition. There must be a\npart of the consciousness that knows object A and another than knows\nobject B. Various Buddhists who want to hold consciousness to be truly\nsingular, have attempted to avoid these faults in a variety of ways.\nSome have attempted to claim they avoid the faults because they assert\nthat there are an equal number of consciousnesses as objects. Others\nclaim that they avoid these problems because they claim consciousness\nexists in a non-dual relationship with its objects. Each of these\ninterpretive turns was met by \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita with\nlogical analysis demonstrating what he considered to be the inevitable\ncontradictions that ensue by the various attempts at claiming that\nconsciousness is truly singular. In this manner,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita analyzes a host of current claims of true\nsingularity over the course of the first sixty stanzas of the MA.\n\nHaving examined all those phenomena which his philosophical opponents\nclaim have or are of a truly singular nature and\ndetermined through reasoned analysis that they in fact, could not\npossibly have or be of a truly singular nature,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita proceeds to consider the possibility of\nthere being a truly manifold nature in phenomena. Because a manifold\nnature would depend upon the aggregation of true singularities, he\nconcludes that just as there can be no inherently singular nature,\nthere also can be no inherently manifold nature. And since there is no\nthird alternative for entities with an inherent nature, there must be\nno phenomena that have an inherently existent nature at all. While\nelaborated upon in greater detail in his auto-commentary, MAV, his\nterse summary of the neither-one-nor many argument is found in the\nsixty-first and sixty-second stanzas of MA as follows:\n\nWe have found with analysis that no entity, whatsoever, has an\n[inherently] single nature. Those that have no single nature must also\nnot have a manifold nature (vs. 61). The existence of an entity\nbelonging to a class other than that which has a single or manifold\n[nature] does not make sense because the two are exhaustive of all\npossible alternatives (vs.\n 62).[8]\n\n\nThus, an object\u2019s lack of, or emptiness of having an inherently\nexistent nature is an ultimate truth for \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita.\nHe considers that this position has been logically established by way\nof the neither-one-nor-many argument.\n1.3 The Two Truths: Conventional Truths\n\nIn a variety of ways, virtually all M\u0101dhyamika\u2019s reject the\nexistence of an ultimate, absolute, unchanging nature in things, as\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita demonstrates in the first sixty-two\nstanzas of MA. This is a key component in their presentations of\nultimate truths. The anti-essentialist position of rejecting an\nultimate nature in phenomena enables a M\u0101dhyamika, such as\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita in this case, to avoid the\n\u201cextreme\u201d of clinging to objects as permanent, or more\nprecisely, as enduring for more than a moment. Though the arguments\nmay vary, most M\u0101dhyamika thinkers are similar in their\ndescriptions of ultimate truths. Debates among M\u0101dhyamikas tend\nto rise in relation to their presentations of conventional truths, the\nmeans by which the \u201cextreme\u201d of non-existence is\navoided.\n\nAfter concluding that phenomena do not ultimately exist,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita offers his concise summation and\ndefinition of a conventional truth in the sixty-third and sixty forth\nstanzas of MA:\n\nTherefore, these entities are characterized only by conventionality.\nIf someone accepts them as ultimate, what can I do for that person?\n\n\nThose phenomena that are only agreeable when not put to the test\nof\n\n[ultimate] analysis, those phenomena that are generated and\ndisintegrate and those that have the ability to function are known to\nbe of a conventional nature.\n\n\n\u015aantarak\u1e63ita comments on these verses by clarifying that,\n\u201cThis [kind of] conventional is not an entity of mere verbal\ndesignation but since they are dependently arisen entities which are\nperceived and wished for, they are authentic conventionalities\n(tathyasa\u1e43\u1e7frti).\u201d\n [9]\n\nIn these stanzas and in his accompanying auto-commentary, MAV,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita presents the parameters for his\ndefinition of a conventional truth that is authentic\n(Skt.tathya, Tib. yang dag pa). They are:\n\nthat which is known by a mind,\nthat which has the ability to function (i.e., that it is\ncausally efficacious),\nthat which is impermanent, and\nthat which is unable to withstand analysis which searches for an\nultimate nature or essence in entities.\n\n\nIn addition, later in the text, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita describes\nsuch objects in a manner previously only used by proponents of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra school, namely, that such objects\nare \u201cmere consciousness only\u201d. (This aspect will be\ndiscussed below in the section entitled\n\u201cYog\u0101c\u0101ra-Madhyamaka Synthesis\u201d.)\n\nTruths are objects of knowledge in Madhyamaka ontology, so the quality\nof being known by a mind is an imperative and to some degree a\ntautologous assertion. Being impermanent and causally efficacious\nimplies, in Buddhist thought, that they are dependently-arisen, that\nthey arise on the basis of impermanent causes and conditions that are\nthemselves, dependently-arisen. In his own commentary on these\nstanzas, MAV, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita explicitly describes\nconventional truths as dependently-arisen. He goes on to state that\nconventional truths are known with conceptual thought and designated\nby worldly convention (MAV, 88\u201393). Thus an object\u2019s lack\nof an inherent nature is an ultimate truth. Those impermanent,\ndependently arisen, causally efficacious objects of knowledge that are\nknown by conceptual thinking are conventional truths. This is how\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita presents his views on the ontological\nstatus of phenomena in his texts MA and MAV.\n1.4 The Two Truths: Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-Madhyamaka Synthesis\n\nIn addition to presenting the two truths as described above, a\npresentation that is not particularly out of the ordinary for a\nMadhyamaka thinker, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita elaborates further,\nin ways that must have made his presentation seem unorthodox to\nmainline M\u0101dhyamikas in eighth century India. Although there were\nother Indian M\u0101dhyamikas who attempted to incorporate dimensions\nof Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra (Mind-Only) thought into their\nMadhyamaka perspective (including \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s\nown disciples Kamala\u015b\u012bla and Haribhadra, as well as\npredecessors like \u0100rya Vimuktisena, \u015arigupta,\nJ\u00f1\u0101nagarbha), \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is undoubtedly\nthe most noteworthy and most famous Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-Madhyamaka\n synthesizer.[10]\n There are two primary areas where we find Yog\u0101c\u0101ra ideas\nincorporated into \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s thought: his\npresentation of conventional truths where he describes them as being\nof the nature of consciousness, and his conventional acceptance of\nself-cognizing consciousness or reflexive awareness\n(svasa\u1e43vedana).\n\nOne of the fundamental tenets of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra schools of Buddhist thought is the\nassertion that phenomena are not of an utterly distinct nature from\nconsciousness. The pan-Mah\u0101y\u0101na idea of emptiness is in fact\ndescribed in this way Yog\u0101c\u0101ras/Cittam\u0101tras, by\nclaiming that emptiness refers to an object\u2019s lack of a nature\nthat is distinct from the consciousness perceiving it. This is\ncontrasted with the common Madhyamaka description of emptiness as\nreferring to an object\u2019s lack or emptiness of its own nature or\nessence in and of itself. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita incorporates\nthis Yog\u0101c\u0101ra line of thinking into his presentation of\nconventional truths when he writes in the ninety-first stanza of\nMA:\n\nThat which is cause and result is mere consciousness only. Whatever is\nestablished by itself abides in\n consciousness.[11]\n\n\nThis statement refers to his earlier descriptions of conventional\ntruths (cited above) where he describes conventional truths as\nphenomena that have the ability to function and which generate and\ndisintegrate. In M\u0101dhyamika discourse, \u201cThat which is cause\nand result,\u201d is simply another way of referring to conventional\ntruths. It refers to that which is impermanent, dependently-arisen,\nand causally efficacious, the three being co-extensive with each other\nand with conventional truths in general. Thus, by stating that,\n\u201cthat which is cause and result is mere consciousness,\u201d\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is stating that conventional truths are\nof the nature of consciousness. This is an ultimate description of\nreality for proponents of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra\nsystems, but for \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita here, this is part of\nhis presentation of conventional truths, thus, incorporating a\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra orientation for his presentation of\nconventional truths.\n\nA further development of this philosophical synthesis that\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is putting forth is described even more\nexplicitly in the next stanza, the ninety-second:\n\nBy relying on the Mind-Only (Cittam\u0101tra, Sems tsam pa)\nsystem, know that external entities do not exist. And by relying on\nthis [Middle Way (Madhyamaka, dbU ma)] system, know that no\nself exists at all, even in that\n [mind].[12]\n\n\nHere we find a particularly important and unique aspect of\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s presentation of the two truths.\nIt is not merely that he incorporates aspects of Mind-Only thinking\ninto his presentation that makes it unique. It is unique because for\nvirtually all of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s Madhyamaka\npredecessors in India, the two truths are utilized solely as a vehicle\nfor presenting the ontological status of entities. It is done by way\nof describing the mode of being for various objects of knowledge\n(ultimate truths and conventional truths). This common Madhyamaka way\nof approaching the two truths is present in\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita as well, but there is more here. In\naddition to stating the ultimate truths exist in x way and\nconventional truths exist in y way,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is also using his presentation of\nconventional truths as a stepping stone for his readers. A proper\nunderstanding of conventional truths takes a person part of the way\ntowards an understanding of the ultimate. Previous Madhyamaka\npresentations of conventional truths do not incorporate this practical\ndimension. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, conventional truths are\nnot completely mistaken. By properly understanding conventional truths\n(i.e., as a follower of Cittam\u0101tra tenets understands\nthe ultimate), one is well on the way to a proper understanding of the\nultimate from his Madhyamaka perspective\u2014the most subtle and\naccurate philosophical presentation of reality. There is a dynamic\nstep at work in \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s presentation of\nthe two truths; first one understands that entities are not of a\ndistinct nature from that of the mind (as Mind-Only proponents claim)\nand then they progress to realize that nothing exists in and of itself\n(the Madhyamaka perspective), even the mind. This dynamic engagement\nwith conventional truths is unique among Madhyamaka thinkers and a\ncritical innovation in the thought of\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita.\n2. More Dynamic Aspects of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s Philosophical Enterprise\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was a towering figure in eighth century\nIndian philosophy. It appears from the little evidence we have that he\nwas fully engaged in the philosophical arena of his day including the\ncomposition of polemical tracts against his rivals. We can assume that\nthese were taken seriously by his opponents because some of his extant\nwritings are only known today because they were preserved in Jain\nlibraries. But \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s philosophical\nstyle was richer than simple polemics. In texts like MA, he led his\nreaders through a dynamic engagement with competing views. Competing\nviews, particularly competing Buddhist philosophical views were\nutilized in his texts in ways that encouraged his readers to\ncontemplate the full impact and import of those views. In other words,\nhe seems to encourage a provisional acceptance of competing Buddhist\nviews as he presents a philosophical hierarchy of tenets. This method\nmakes for a quite dynamic engagement with those competing views where\nprovisionally taking on the competing views serves to have a\ntransformative affect on the mind of the student as they ascend the\nphilosophical hierarchy. They were not simply used as vehicles for\nilluminating his own view by contrasting it with those of his Buddhist\nrivals, though he was certainly doing that as well.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was doing more than that; he was\nencouraging his readers to take on those philosophical tenet systems\nhe considered to be hierarchically \u201clower\u201d in order to\nfacilitate what seems to be a dynamic philosophical enterprise of\nmulti-tiered engagement with a host of philosophical positions and\nviews. In a tradition where philosophical inquiry is a form of\nreligious praxis, it appears that provisional acceptance of the tenets\nof lower schools was used to ripen the mind for increasingly more\nsubtle and accurate philosophical descriptions of reality. In other\nwords, since the cultivation of experiential wisdom knowing reality is\nat the heart of what facilitates the larger tradition\u2019s\nsoteriological goals, this dynamic method can be said to serve\nsoteriological\n aims.[13]\n\nThis process can be witnessed to a degree in\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s encyclopedic tenets text,\nTattvasa\u1e43graha, but is most clearly presented in MA. In\nhis application of the neither-one-nor-many argument in MA (described\nabove), the careful reader is drawn to notice that as\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita proceeds through his examination of\ncompeting views, he does so through the shifting lens of three\nphilosophical\n perspectives.[14]\n In the first fifteen stanzas of the text, he seems to be analyzing\nnon-Buddhist and Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika tenets as a holder of\nSautr\u0101ntika tenets would. His criticisms of those views are of a\ntype that a Sautr\u0101ntika would utilize and his forms of reasoning\nare as well. It is as if he is encouraging his readers to adopt a\nSautr\u0101ntika outlook and all that entails. Though there may be\npolemics involved (If x view can even be refuted by\nSautr\u0101ntikas, what need is there to discuss the superiority of\nthe Madhyamaka?), it appears that what is at work in an actual\nencouragement of his readers to seriously take on a Sautr\u0101ntika\nposition, at least provisionally.\n\nWhen he begins to examine the various positions of Sautr\u0101ntikas,\nhis perspective shifts and he starts to argue as a\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra would. He criticizes the varying\nSautr\u0101ntika perspectives as a Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra\nwould, by making criticisms about how knowledge of entities external\nto consciousness could be known. And he makes these arguments both in\nthe context of the neither-one-nor-many framework and with the types\nof reasoning Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra thinkers such as\nDharmak\u012brti, might utilize. One might think that the focus of his\ncriticisms would be solely on Madhyamaka issues about own-essences\n(svabh\u0101va), but a major focus at this point is on the\nseparation of objects from consciousness. It is as if\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is encouraging his readers to take on a\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra perspective, for at this point\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita seems to feign acceptance of a\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra perspective. He does not qualify\nhis acceptance as merely conventional. He argues against\nSautr\u0101ntika positions, as a Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra.\nIt is only later in the text, when he begins to discuss the two truths\nthat we come to learn that his acceptance of\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra tenets is qualified and\nprovisional. Finally, beginning in the forty-fifth stanza, when\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita begins to analyze various positions\nasserted by proponents of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittamatra tenet, he\ntakes on his final position as a M\u0101dhyamika. He then criticizes\nsuch positions from a M\u0101dhyamika perspective and utilizes the\nsorts of reasoning a M\u0101dhyamika would use to refute\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittamatra tenets, focusing on a rejection of\nessences. Thus, he has made his final shift in frames or scales of\nanalysis. As he concludes the neither-one-nor-many argument and\ndiscusses a host of issues of great import in the remainder of the\ntext, he maintains his final position as a M\u0101dhyamika.\n\nIn the process of these shifting provisionalities, or scales of\nanalysis, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita has led his readers through a\ndynamic engagement with a host of philosophical views. They are not\nmerely presented to be refuted (though that is certainly happening),\nbut through an apparent feigned acceptance of \u201clower\u201d\ntenets as he makes his way up a hierarchical ladder of philosophical\nviews, his readers are actively encouraged to engage fully by taking\non these other views that will ultimately be rejected. Rather than\nrefute and dismiss competing views, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita seems\nto recognize a utility in their engagement, one that serves the\nteleological function of leading the reader to (in his opinion) the\nhighest philosophical view, the Madhyamaka. For ultimately, the\npurpose of Buddhist philosophical inquiry has a soteriological\nfunction as well. Suffering, according to the Buddha, is caused by\nconfusion and ignorance, by a misunderstanding of the world and its\nfunctions. Thus, the duty of the Buddhist philosopher is to attempt to\nindicate for the suffering masses, as clearly as possible, the precise\nnature of their confusions and misunderstandings that lay at the heart\nof their suffering. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, it is attachment\nto a fixed nature or essence in things which is at the root of the\nproblem. So a dynamic philosophical process that can skillfully lead\nreaders to the Madhyamaka perspective, the one that both understands\nand undermines all clinging to fixed natures, is a critical and\ncreative part of ascending the spiritual path.\n3. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s Epistemological Thought\n\nThe spearheading of the Buddhist logico-epistemological tradition\n(pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da\n )[15]\n by Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti, at first in response to Indian\nthought in the area of philosophy of language and in dialogue with\nnon-Buddhist philosophers, resulted in a tremendous impact on many\ndimensions of Buddhist philosophical discourse in the middle and late\nperiods of Indian Buddhism. Though its impact could be seen before\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (in facets of Bh\u0101viveka\u2019s\nwritings), he was the first major Madhyamaka thinker who was also a\ncommentator on Dharmak\u012brti, a contributor to this discourse, and\nwho attempted to integrate its insights into a Madhyamaka framework.\n(Both Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti are more closely associated\nwith the Mind-Only school). One can witness one dimension of the\nprofound influence \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita had on Tibetan\nBuddhist thought, even given the differences in the details, when\nobserving this integration of Madhyamaka and\npram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da thought in towering Tibetan\nthinkers such as Sakya Pandita and Tsongkhapa among others.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s thought on logico-epistemological\nissues is primarily found in his encyclopedic doxography,\nTattvasa\u1e43graha and in his commentary on\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s V\u0101dany\u0101ya entitled\nVipa\u00f1cit\u0101rth\u0101. In order to properly situate\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s thought on these issues, it is\nnecessary to briefly discuss that of his two most important\npredecessors in this area: Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti.\n\nCentral to the logico-epistemological tradition in general and\n\u015aantarak\u1e63ita in particular is the question of what\nconstitutes a means by which one accrues an instance of indubitable\nknowing. In other words, how does one justify considering a moment of\nawareness or cognitive episode as valid knowledge\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a)? What constitutes trustworthy awareness?\nFor \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, the pram\u0101\u1e47a that\nis the means of justifying an instant of valid knowing is\nsimultaneously indistinct from the instant of valid knowing itself\n(McClintock 2002, 57).\n\nAs with Dharmak\u012brti, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita describes valid\nknowledge or valid cognitions as instants of new knowledge in the\nsense that the cognizer knows newly something which to that point was\nunknown. Generally speaking, Buddhist\npram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da thinkers categorize two types of\n\npram\u0101\u1e47a[16]:\n perception\n (pratyak\u1e63a)[17]\n and inference (anum\u0101na). Objects of perception are\ncausally efficacious particulars (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a),\nactual instance of things in the world with temporal and spatial\nlocation. It is only particulars that are considered to be real.\nGenerally, it would be thought that words apply to universals\n(s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) which are conceptual\nconstructs that have no causal efficacy in the world. Thus the early\npram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da thinkers like Dign\u0101ga and\nDharmak\u012brti can be considered to hold a soft form of\nconnotationism in that they would reject a denotationist view that\nconsiders words to apply directly to actual particulars. The intuition\nthat a word points to a particular would be very objectionable. A word\ncannot express a particular because particulars are limitless and\nwords have limits. Yet they are soft connotationists in that via a\nprocess of elimination or exclusion, they posit a way in which\nlanguage is both not arbitrary and not a reference to particulars.\nInferences are cognitions based on valid reasons that depend on this\nnon-arbitrary use of\n language.[18]\n\nAmong the philosophical issues that are important here is the\nfundamental question of how, if the world is only directly accessibly\nby perception, can one come to valid knowledge by means of inference\nthat relies on words that do not directly refer to particulars? How\ndoes one link the ineffable world of particulars to language, and thus\nto an inference that could produce valid knowledge? Since words do not\napply to actual objects or particulars which are ineffable,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, like his predecessors Dharmak\u012brti\nand Dign\u0101ga, needs to explain how it is that we are talking about\nthe world, while at the same time making it clear that we are not\ntalking about the world, but our conceptual scheme. Yet he also must\nmake clear that all conceptual schemes are not equal in that some can\nproduce valid knowledge and some fail to do so. There must be a degree\nof non-arbitrariness to language if inference is to be considered as a\nsource of valid knowledge. There are true and false statements and\nconsequences for beliefs about them. So the challenge is: how does one\nlink the ineffable world of particulars to language?\n\nEach of the pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da thinkers, including\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, begin to address these questions with\nvariations on a theory initiated by Dign\u0101ga and fine-tuned by\nDharmak\u012brti and his followers, known as exclusion\n(apoha) theory. Dign\u0101ga\u2019s response to the problem\nbegins by claiming that language does not refer to universals, as one\nmight presume a Buddhist would argue, but rather, through a negative\nprocess of exclusions or apoha, eliminates that which\ncontradicts the referred object. Words talk about entities in so far\nas they are qualified by the negation of other things. Though nothing\naffirmative is said about reality, by use of exclusions, there is a\nrelationship between concepts and particulars. Apoha or\nexclusions typically involves a double negation. Because in Buddhism\nthe absence of something is a fiction in that absences are not caused\nand do not function, exclusions can be used to explain away universals\nas the referents of words. Because negations are fictions, this\nlightens the ontological commitment. A distinction is drawn between\nentities and pseudo-entities. Only particulars are real; negations are\nnot real, but they are also not universals. Universals are positive or\naffirmative, whereas exclusions are negative. Dign\u0101ga\u2019s\nposition is explained quite succinctly by Bimal Matilal:\n\nEach name, as Dign\u0101ga understands, dichotomizes the universe into\ntwo: those to which the name can be applied and those to which it\ncannot be applied. The function of a name is to exclude the object\nfrom the class of those objects to which it cannot be applied. One\nmight say that the function of a name is to locate the object outside\nof the class of those to which it cannot be applied. (Matilal 1971,\n45)\n\n\nDign\u0101ga argues for a way in which language can be construed to\nsignify particulars, through a double negation that excludes that\nwhich contradicts the referent object while eliminating the\nphilosophical commitment to universals. Though the process of\nexclusion seems quite cumbersome, in actuality our language formation\nand conceptual processes seem to engage in it quite naturally.\n\nDharmak\u012brti adds several components to the thought of\nDign\u0101ga on these issues concerning valid knowledge. In defining\nperception as a source or means of valid knowledge, Dharmak\u012brti\ndescribes it as that cognition that is free from conceptuality\nand non-erroneous. The inclusion of the qualification of it\nbeing non-erroneous eliminates erroneous non-conceptual cognitions,\nsuch as mistakenly seeing two moons, from the category of valid\nknowledge. Dharmak\u012brti further distinguishes two ways of\napprehending objects: through perceptions which apprehend real objects\npositively, as they are, through the mediation of images\n(\u0101k\u0101ra) which perfectly reflect them, and through\nconcepts which get at their objects negatively, through the\nelimination of their opposites. Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s insight is\nfound in the connection he draws between reality and the conceptual\nrealm of universals. For Dharmak\u012brti, experience and\nrepresentations are the bridge. We construct concepts out of our\nexperiences and representations of functional resemblances of real\nentities. In other words, we can validly group together\nrepresentations of actually unique entities on the basis that they can\nbe excluded from the class of things that do not perform a given\nfunction. Georges Dreyfus put it well:\n\nFor Dharmak\u012brti, the conceptual process is neither arbitrary nor\ngroundless, even though it does not reflect reality. Conceptuality\ndoes not arise out of nothing but results from experience. As we may\nrecall, things such as trees, for instance, have functional\nsimilarities. In dependence on our experiences in which the functional\nresemblances of things are registered, we construct concepts. Thus,\nconceptuality arises as a result of our experiences. In this way\nconceptual thoughts are connected indirectly to reality. (Dreyfus\n1997, 226)\n\n\nIn other words, there are several components to\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s exclusion theory: the entity or particular,\nthe image or representation, and the exclusion. First there are real\nevents of real entities. Then there is a perception that has the mark\nof a real entity because it is caused by something real. It is a\nmirror-like image of the real. This is followed by a conceptual\nrepresentation superimposed on a real image. This is part real, part\nconcept. Finally, after this is done, there is an assumption of\ncommonality with other conceptual representations. This assumption is\nunreal and is the basis of the exclusion or universal. It derives not\nfrom the reality of common characteristics, but judgments of\nsimilarity. This is where concepts are conceived of as representing\nproperties that are thought to exist in the world, such as permanence,\nwhich in fact do not. But it is through this process of exclusion that\none can utilize positive language with the understanding that that\nlanguage only refers to a common negation.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s treatment of these issues largely\nrevolves around a response to the criticisms found in such\nnon-Buddhist thinkers as Kum\u0101rila (ca. 600\u2013660) and\nUddyotakara (fl. 525). Kum\u0101rila levels three criticisms\nof apoha theory in particular: that it is circular, that it\nis counter-intuitive, and that it is redundant.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s response to these criticisms\nbegins by describing three primary types of negations which he equates\nwith exclusions: non-implicative negations (Skt.\nprasajyaprati\u1e63edha, Tib. med dgag) and two\ntypes of implicative negations (Skt.\nparyud\u0101saprati\u1e63edha, Tib. ma yin dgag):\nmental exclusions and object exclusions. A non-implicative negation is\na negation that does not imply the existence of some other thing. For\nexample, the negation of the existence of flowers that grows in the\nsky does not imply the existence of other plants that grow in the sky.\nIt is a mere negation with nothing implied. On the other hand,\nimplicative negations, while denying the existence of one thing, imply\nthe existence of another. An example of an implicative negation would\nbe if we were told that either my aunt or my uncle came over last\nnight. If my aunt did not come, it implies that my uncle did. Thus,\nthere is something implied by the negation. Among the types of\nimplicative negations, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita includes mental\nexclusions. It is important to point out here that for\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, negations and exclusions are virtually\nsynonymous. Mental exclusions are conceptual representations that\nrelate to the appearances or representations of entities, as discussed\nby Dign\u0101ga. Object exclusions are not conceptual representations\nof mere appearances or representations, but rather can relate to the\nreal world. Thus, this form of exclusion is a real thing for\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita. It is these three types of exclusions\nthat form the basis of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s thought on\nthis topic, the basis of his psychological interpretation of\napoha, and the basis of his response to the critics of\nDharmak\u012briti\u2019s apoha theory, such as\nKum\u0101rila.\n\nIn addition to the three types of exclusions, central to\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s thought on the topic is his\nunique presentation of representations and the psychological\ndimensions to his exclusion\n theory.[19]\n According to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, it is our experiences of\nunifying similarities among representations that gives rise to our\nconceptual constructs. Mental representations of objects are\nexclusions because they exclude other representations. These\nconceptual representations are misconstrued to be the actual objects\nsince the actual objects do not exist in them. For\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, both the exclusion of that which is\nother than real particular and the exclusion of that which is other\nthan the representation are both apohas or exclusions. The\npsychological dimension to exclusion is particularly important in\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s apoha theory in that he\nemphasizes the role of negation in relation to mental representations\nand mental events in the conceptualizing process. For\nDharmak\u012brti, universals are the objects of concepts.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita agrees with this point but stresses that\nthe concept is the mental representation or mental event and that is\nan exclusion, whereas for Dharmak\u012brti the representations are the\nbasis which supports the exclusions and concepts. For\nDharmak\u012brti, exclusions are conceptual fictions, whereas for\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita they can be real entities.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita considers that he is fully able to\nrespond to the criticisms of Kum\u0101rila with his presentation of\nexclusions. For example, Kum\u0101rila charges that the Buddhist\napoha theories are counter-intuitive in that our intuition is\nnot that words and concepts refer to negations or exclusions.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita argues that Kum\u0101rila misunderstands\napoha to always be non-implicative negations. He misses the\ntwo types of implicative negations that \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nclearly specifies as included among forms of exclusions. For\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, when we use words, the objects of such\nconceptual thoughts are the real objects. They are the indirect object\nof the exclusion that is a form of implicative negation, which\nincludes negative aspects by implication. Thus, words can be\nindicative of positive elements. The external object implies the image\nplus the exclusion of that which is other. The words or concepts thus\ntake external objects as their objects and imply the conceptual\nexclusions. Thus when Kum\u0101rila mistakes all exclusions to be\nnon-implicative negations, he misses this key component to the\npsychological functions at work and mistakes apoha theory to\nbe counter-intuitive.\n\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s charge of circularity in apoha theory\nis one of the most critical for its defenders to answer. The main\nthrust of the argument was already found in Uddyotakara\u2019s\nNy\u0101yav\u0101rttika, where he argues that apoha\nentails the problems of circularity and denotationism (which\napoha theorists consider it is imperative to avoid). This is\nthe case because there must be an affirmative denotation between words\nand particulars since the negation of an object implies that one first\nhave a positive understanding of the object. One must first have an\naffirmative understanding before one can negate its exclusion. Dreyfus\nsummarizes Kum\u0101rila\u2019s presentation of the argument\nsuccinctly as follows:\n\nIf conceptual understanding involves negation of x, then\nunderstanding of x will presuppose that of non-x,\nwhich in turn presupposes that of non-non-x. And this is\nnothing but an understanding of x. (Dreyfus 1997, 242)\n\n\nIn other words, Kum\u0101rila argues that since a conceptual\nunderstanding of a cow is simply an understanding of non-non-cow\naccording to apoha theory, that in order to understand\nnon-non-cow, one must already understand cow. Thus, apoha\ntheory must resort to circularity, or perhaps even more precisely, it\nlacks a beginning point for the circle in the first place. Uddyotakara\nemphasizes that the only way out is to resort to a linguistic\ndenotationism that apoha theorists want to avoid.\nKum\u0101rila stresses the interdependence of knowing cow and knowing\nnon-cow and not non-cow. Both question how a double negation is\nsomething other than a positive universal.\n\nThe crux of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s response, again,\nrelies on his presentation of three types of exclusions, specifically\nthe mental exclusion that is signified by words, a point he feels both\nUddyotakara and Kum\u0101rila fail to recognize. According to\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, there is a conceptual image that is an\nexclusion that is generated in the mind of one who hears the words,\n\u201cThis animal is a cow,\u201d for example, but that this idea is\nan implicative negation that only implies that this animal is not a\nnon-cow. According to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, the problem of\ncircularity is thus avoided by a proper understanding of implicative\nnegations: to understand cow one need not understand non-cow, but\nrather the mere idea of cow. Like Dharmak\u012brti,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita relies on a judgment of similarity in\nfunctional efficacy among distinct particulars as conceptually\nconstrued to generate the idea. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita the\nemphasis is on similarity among the mental representations of them.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Dharmak\u012brti both argue that\nthere is not a problem with grouping things as x and\nnon-x. The distinction between similar and dissimilar classes\nis made and the word merely applied to indicate this understood\ndistinction. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, based on judgments of\nsimilarity, the classes of cows and non-cows are established. It is\nthe word that is applied to them which is not established. It is the\nword that is used to indicate this judgment of similarity at the\ndiscretion of the speaker. Thus, for \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, the\nperceived problem of circularity by Uddyotakara and Kum\u0101rila is\ndue to their misunderstanding of exclusions and negations.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s response to Hindu critics of\napoha and the interpretive innovations that spring from it\nrepresent a critical juncture in Buddhist logico-epistemological\nthought. Though we see examples of integration of\npram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da thinking into the ideas of a\nM\u0101dhyamika philosopher, most notably with Bh\u0101viveka, it is\nnot until \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita that we see this marriage of\nideas fully integrated and spelled out in a sophisticated way. It is\ndifficult to overstate the tremendous impact this marriage of two\nmajor strands of late Indian philosophical thought in\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita had on the philosophical traditions of\nTibet.\n",
