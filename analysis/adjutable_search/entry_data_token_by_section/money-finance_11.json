    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || Finance, Money, and Domestic Justice\n5.3 Finance and Global Justice\n\nFinally, a number of issues relate questions about finance to\nquestions about global justice. The debate about global justice (see\nalso\n global justice)\n has weighed the pros and cons of \u201cstatist\u201d and\n\u201ccosmopolitan\u201d approaches, that is, approaches to justice\nthat would focus on the nation state (maybe with some additional\nduties of beneficence to the globally poor) or on the global scale.\nThe financial system is one of the most globalized systems of social\ninteraction that currently exist, and global entanglements are hard to\ndeny (e.g., Valentini 2011: 195\u20138). The question thus is whether\nthis creates duties of justice on the financial system, and if so,\nwhether it fulfills these duties, i.e., whether it contributes to\nmaking the world more globally just, or whether it tends in the\nopposite direction (or whether it is neutral).\n\nThere are a number of institutions, especially the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), that constitute a rudimentary\nglobal order of finance. Arguably, many countries, especially poorer\nones, cannot reasonably opt out of the rules established by these\ninstitutions (e.g., Hassoun 2012, Krishnamurthy 2014). It might\ntherefore appear to be required by justice that these institutions be\ngoverned in a way that represents the interests of all countries. But\nbecause of historical path-dependencies, and because a large part of\ntheir budget comes from Western countries, the governance structures\nare strongly biased in their favor (for example, the US can veto all\nimportant decisions in the IMF). Miller (2010: 134\u201341) has\ndescribed this situation as \u201cindirect financial rule\u201d by\nthe US (see also Herzog 2021).\n\nAn issue worth noting in this context is the fact that the US dollar,\nand to a lesser degree the Euro, function as de facto global\ncurrencies, with a large part of global trade being conducted in these\ncurrencies (e.g., Mehrling 2011, Eichengreen 2011). This allows the\nissuing countries to run a current account deficit, which amounts to a\nredistribution from poorer to richer countries for which compensation\nmight be owed (Reddy 2005: 224\u20135). This fact also raises\nquestions about the distribution of power in the global sphere, which\nhas often been criticized as favoring Western countries (e.g., Gulati\n1980, United Nations 2009). However, global financial markets serve\nnot only to finance trade in goods and services; there are also\nquestions about fluctuations in these markets that result exclusively\nfrom speculations (see also sect.1.4.3 above). Such fluctuations can\ndisproportionately harm poorer countries, which are more vulnerable to\nmovements of capital or rapid changes in commodity prices. Hence, an\nold proposal that has recently been revived and defended from a\nperspective of global justice is that of a \u201cTobin tax\u201d\n(Tobin 1978), which would tax financial transactions and thereby\nreduce volatility in international financial markets (Reddy 2005,\nWollner 2014).\n\nA second feature of the current global order that has been criticized\nfrom a perspective of justice is the \u201cborrowing\nprivilege\u201d. As Pogge describes (e.g., 2008: chap. 4), the\ngovernments of countries can borrow on international financial\nmarkets, no matter whether they have democratic legitimacy or not.\nThis means that rogue governments can finance themselves by incurring\ndebts that future generations of citizens will have to repay.\n\nSovereign debt raises a number of questions that are related to global\njustice. Usually, the contracts on which they are based are considered\nas absolutely binding (e.g., Suttle 2016), which can threaten national\nsovereignty (Dietsch 2011), and raises questions of the moral and\npolitical responsibilities both of citizens of debtor nations, and of\ncreditor countries themselves (Wiedenbr\u00fcg, 2018a, 2018b). These\nproblems obtain in particular with regard to what has been called\n\u201codious\u201d debt (Sack 1927, Howse 2007, Dimitriu 2015, King\n2016): cases in which government officials sign debt contracts in\norder to enrich themselves, with lenders being aware of this fact.\nSuch cases have been at the center of calls for a jubilee for indebted\nnations. At the moment, there are no binding international rules for\nhow to deal with sovereign bankruptcy, and countries in financial\ndistress have no systematic possibility of making their claims heard,\nwhich is problematic from a perspective of justice (e.g., Palley 2003;\nReddy 2005: 26\u201333; Herman 2007; C. Barry & Tomitova 2007;\nWollner 2018). The IMF, which often supports countries in\nrestructuring sovereign debt, has often made this support conditional\nupon certain requirements about rearranging the economic structures of\na country (for a discussion of the permissibility of such practices\nsee C. Barry 2011).\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, the issue of financial\nregulation has a global dimension in the sense that capital is mobile\nacross national boundaries, creating the threats to democracy\ndescribed above. This fact makes it difficult for individual\ncountries, especially smaller ones, to install the more rigid\nfinancial regulations that would be required from a perspective of\njustice. Just as with many other questions of global justice (see,\ne.g., Dietsch 2015 on taxation), we seem to see a failure of\ncoordination between countries, which leads to a \u201crace to the\nbottom\u201d. Making global financial institutions more just is\ntherefore likely to require significant levels of international\ncooperation.\n",
