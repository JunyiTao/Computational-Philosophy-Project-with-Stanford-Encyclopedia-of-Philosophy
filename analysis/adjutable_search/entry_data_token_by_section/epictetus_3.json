Rationality\n\nThe linchpin of Epictetus\u2019s entire philosophy is his account of\nwhat it is to be a human being; that is, to be a rational mortal\ncreature. \u201cRational\u201d as a descriptive term means that\nhuman beings have the capacity to \u201cuse impressions\u201d in a\nreflective manner. Animals, like humans, use their impressions of the\nworld in that their behavior is guided by what they perceive their\ncircumstances to be. But human beings also examine the content of\ntheir impressions to determine whether they are true or false; we have\nthe faculty of \u201cassent\u201d (1.6.12\u201322).\n\nAssent is regulated by our awareness of logical consistency or\ncontradiction between the proposition under consideration and beliefs\nthat one already holds: when we are not aware of any contradiction, we\nassent readily, but when we perceive a conflict we are strongly\nconstrained to reject one or the other of the conflicting views\n(2.26.3). Thus Medea kills her children because she believes it is to\nher advantage to do so; if someone were to show her clearly that she\nis deceived in this belief, she would not do it (1.28.8). Our hatred\nof being deceived, our inability to accept as true what we clearly see\nto be false, is for Epictetus the most basic fact about human beings\nand the most promising (1.28.1\u20135).\n4.2. Kinship with god\n\nEpictetus is also very concerned to situate the rationality of the\nhuman being within a maximally rational universe. His confidence in\nthe fundamental orderliness of all things is expressed in frequent\nreferences to Zeus or \u201cthe god\u201d as the designer and\nadministrator of the universe. There seems to be no question of\ncompetition with any other deities or powers. Epictetus does sometimes\nspeak, conventionally for a Greek, of \u201cgods\u201d in the\nplural, but Zeus remains unquestionably supreme: he enjoys having some\ncompany, just as we do (3.13.4), but does not require assistance and\ncannot be opposed.\n\nImmanent rather than transcendent, Zeus inheres in, and may indeed be\nidentified with, the natural order. As such he is in theory fully\naccessible to human comprehension in the same way as all objects and\nevents are accessible to our comprehension. With effort, rational\nbeings can come to understand Zeus as a person, a rational being with\nthoughts and intentions like ours. That recognition inspires awe and\ngratitude, a \u201chymn of praise\u201d that it is our duty to offer\nin each occasion of life (1.16.19).\n\nGod is the creator of humankind as of all else, and his attitude\ntoward us is one of complete benevolence. It is by his gift that we\nare rational beings, and our rational nature qualifies us as his\nkindred. More: our minds are actually fragments of Zeus\u2019s mind,\n\u201cparts and offshoots of his own being\u201d (1.14.6,\n2.8.10\u201312). When we make choices on our own account, we exercise\nthe very same power as governs the universe. Hence it can be said that\nZeus has ceded to us a portion of his governance (1.1.12).\n4.3. Volition\n\nIt is, again, the capacity for choice that makes us accountable for\nour own actions and states. Epictetus is particularly fond of\nexploring the implications of this essentially Stoic conception. In\nstudying his usage it is helpful to remember that his favored term\nprohairesis refers more often to the capacity for choice than\nit does to particular acts of choosing. The word is variously\ntranslated; the rendering \u201cvolition\u201d is adopted here as in\nLong 2002.\n\nVolition, Epictetus argues, is \u201cby nature unimpeded\u201d\n(1.17.21), and it is for this reason that freedom is for him an\ninalienable characteristic of the human being. The very notion of a\ncapacity to make one\u2019s own decisions implies as a matter of\nlogical necessity that those decisions are free of external\ncompulsion; otherwise they would not be decisions. But humans do have\nsuch a capacity and are thus profoundly different from even the higher\nanimals, which deal with impressions merely in an unreflective way\n(2.8).\n\nIt is the volition that is the real person, the true self of the\nindividual. Our convictions, attitudes, intentions and actions are\ntruly ours in a way that nothing else is; they are determined solely\nby our use of impressions and thus internal to the sphere of volition.\nThe appearance and comfort of one\u2019s body, one\u2019s\npossessions, one\u2019s relationships with other people, the success\nor failure of one\u2019s projects, and one\u2019s power and\nreputation in the world are all merely contingent facts about a\nperson, features of our experience rather than characteristics of the\nself. These things are all \u201cexternals\u201d; that is, things\nexternal to the sphere of volition.\n4.4. Value\n\nThis distinction between what is internal to the sphere of volition\nand what is external to it is the foundation of Epictetus\u2019s\nsystem of value. What is ultimately worth having, the \u201cgood of\nhumankind,\u201d consists in \u201ca certain disposition of one\u2019s\nvolition\u201d (1.8.16). More explicitly, this disposition is the\ncondition of virtue, the proper expression of our rational nature, in\nwhich we not only act correctly and on the basis of knowledge, but\nalso recognize our kinship to god and witness with joy god\u2019s\norderly management of the universe.\n\nWe are not wrong to believe that whatever is good is advantageous to\nus and worthy of unconditional pursuit, for this is just the\n\u201cpreconception\u201d (prol\u0113psis) of good which\nall human beings possess (1.22). But we err in applying that\npreconception to particular cases, for we frequently assume that\nexternal objects have unconditional value. In reality, the various\ncircumstances of our lives are merely what the volition has to work\nwith and cannot in themselves be either good or bad. \u201cThe\nmaterials of action are indifferent, but the use we make of them is\nnot indifferent\u201d (2.5.1).\n\nAdmittedly some external things are more natural to us than others,\njust as it is natural for a foot, considered solely for itself, to be\nclean rather than muddy, and for an ear of grain to continue growing\nrather than being cut. But this is only when we consider ourselves in\nisolation rather than as parts of a larger whole. As Chrysippus says,\nthe foot if it had a mind would welcome becoming muddy for the sake of\nthe whole (2.6.11). Even one\u2019s own death is of no particular\nconcern if that is what the orderly workings of the universe\nrequire.\n\nThis does not mean that one should be heedless of externals.\n\u201cExternals must be used with care, because their usage is not an\nindifferent matter, yet at the same time with composure and\ntranquility, because the material being used is indifferent\u201d\n(2.5.6). One can recognize that a thing is without ultimate value and\nstill act vigorously in pursuit of it, when doing so is in accordance\nwith one\u2019s rational character. Epictetus offers the analogy of\nball players who recognize that the ball they are running after is of\nno value in itself, and yet exert their full energy to catch it\nbecause of the value they set on playing the game properly (2.5).\n4.5. Emotional adjustment\n\nThe revaluation of external objects brings with it a tremendous sense\nof confidence and inner peace. Grief, fear, envy, desire, and every\nform of anxiety, result from the incorrect supposition that happiness\nis to be found outside oneself (2.16, 3.13.10, etc.). Like earlier\nStoics, Epictetus rejects the supposition that such emotions are\nimposed on us by circumstances or internal forces and are largely\nbeyond our control. Our feelings, as well as our behavior, are an\nexpression of what seems right to us, conditioned by our judgments of\nvalue (1.11.28\u201333). If we correct our judgments, our feelings\nwill be corrected as well. (See Long 2006, 377\u2013394.)\n\nThe analysis is applicable also to feelings like anger and betrayal\nwhich relate to the conduct of other people. The choices made by\nothers are of ethical significance only for the agents themselves; to\nanyone else they are externals and so of no consequence. One should\nnot, then, be angry at Medea for her bad decision. Pity would be\nbetter than that, though the really proper response, if one has the\nopportunity, would be to help her to see her mistake (1.28).\n\nEpictetus\u2019s conception of emotional adjustment is not that one\nshould be \u201cunfeeling like a statue\u201d (3.2.4). Even the\nwisest person may tremble or grow pale at some sudden danger, though\nwithout false assent (fragment 9). More importantly, there are\naffective responses it is right to have. \u201cIt is fitting to be\nelated at the good\u201d; that is, at the goods of soul (2.11.22;\n3.7.7), and one should also experience the aversive feeling he calls\n\u201ccaution\u201d (eulabeia, 2.1.1\u20137) when\nconsidering potential bad choices. Gratitude toward god is also\naffective in nature (2.23). In addition, it is appropriate during the\nperiod of ethical training to experience the pain of remorse as a\nstimulus to ethical development (3.23.30\u201338; see Kamtekar\n(1998)).\n4.6. Appropriate other-concern\n\nIn our relations with other people we are to be governed by the\nattitudes Epictetus calls \u201cmodesty\u201d (aid\u014ds)\nand \u201clove of humanity\u201d (philanthr\u014dpia).\nModesty consists in an awareness of the perspective of others and a\nreadiness to curtail one\u2019s own unseemly behavior; love of\nhumanity is a willingness to exert oneself on others\u2019 behalf.\nThe latter extends especially toward those with whom we are associated\nby our particular role in life: toward children if one is a parent,\ntoward husband or wife if one is married, and so on (2.10, 2.22.20).\nWhile our best service to others is in helping them develop their own\nrational nature, it is also entirely appropriate that we should act to\nfurther the interests of those to whom we are connected by birth or\nsituation.\n\nEpictetus does not believe that there is any conflict between\nother-regarding behavior and appropriate self-concern. We are\nnaturally oriented toward our own well-being, but acting for our own\nsake often entails contributing to the common good (1.19.11-14). More\nparticularly, the preservation of our relationships\n(scheseis) belongs to our own good, though only insofar as it\nis possible to preserve them by right behavior. If maintaining a\nconnection to a family member requires giving up external possessions,\none can do so without hesitation, since one is not thereby sacrificing\nsuch real goods as modesty and fidelity. See 3.3.5-10, with Magrin\n(2018) and Johnson (2014). \n\nIt is a misconception to suppose that proper affection for friends and\nfamily members necessarily leaves us vulnerable to debilitating\nemotions when their welfare is threatened. Just as one can be fond of\na crystal goblet and yet not be upset when it breaks, having realized\nall along that it was a fragile thing, so we should love our children,\nsiblings, and friends while also reminding ourselves of their\nmortality (3.24). The primary relationship is with god; our human\nrelationships should never give us reason to reproach god but should\nenable us to rejoice in the natural order. Concern for others, and\nenjoyment of their company, is indeed part of human nature (3.13.5);\nwhereas irresponsible behavior driven by emotion is not. The father\nwho remains at the bedside of a desperately sick child behaves more,\nnot less, naturally than the one who runs away to weep (1.11).\n4.7. Self-cultivation and autonomy\n\nAchieving the correct disposition of one\u2019s capacity for choice\nrequires more than inclination. The learner must also undertake an\nextensive program of self-examination and correction of views. While\nethical development is made easier by the direct instruction and\nself-help techniques a teacher like Epictetus himself might provide,\nit is also possible without such aid. It is indeed a capability\ninherent in human nature, for the faculty that perceives and corrects\nerrors of judgment is the reasoning faculty itself. Through reason, we\nmay learn to avoid precipitancy in pursue our ends \u201cwith\nreservation\u201d (Encheiridion 2), mindful that god may not\nbring them to fruition; and to avoid precipitancy in action and\nassent. It is even possible to alter such emotional dispositions as\ntimorousness or quickness of temper, through repeated practice in\ngiving more appropriate responses (2.16, 2.18).\n\nOur ability to improve our own dispositions also provides the implicit\nanswer to any question that might be asked about human autonomy in a\nZeus-governed universe. Since for Epictetus action is determined by\ncharacter (what seems right to an individual; 1.2) and not by\nspontaneous impulses, some readers might be inclined to object that\nthis autonomy is only of a limited kind, for a person\u2019s\ncharacter must itself have been assigned to him by Zeus, through the\ncircumstances of his birth and education. Epictetus would reply that\nautonomy is guaranteed not by the absence of antecedent causes but by\nthe very nature of the reasoning faculty. Specific skills like\nhorsemanship make judgments about their own subject matter; the\nreasoning faculty judges other things and also its own prior\njudgments. When it performs this function well, the inherited\ncharacter will improve over time; otherwise it will deteriorate.\n4.8. Mind and body\n\nZeus\u2019s power is limited in that he cannot do what it is\nlogically impossible to do. He could not cause a person to be born\nbefore his parents (1.12.28\u201329), and he could not have made\nvolition execute any choices but its own (1.1.23, 1.17.27). For the\nsame kind of reason, he could not, for all his benevolence, cause a\nperson\u2019s body to be unimpeded in the way volition is unimpeded\n(4.1.100). Our bodies do not in fact belong to us, since we cannot\nalways decide what will happen to them. There is therefore a clear\ncontrast in status between body and mind or soul. Epictetus repeatedly\nuses language belittling the body or representing it as a mere\ninstrument of the mind: it is \u201cpathetic little flesh,\u201d\n\u201ccleverly molded clay,\u201d a \u201clittle donkey\u201d\n(1.1.10, 1.3.5, 4.1.79). At least once he speaks of the body and\npossessions together as \u201cfetters\u201d upon the mind (1.9.11),\nlanguage that recalls the image in Plato\u2019s Phaedo\n82d-83b of the body as prison house.\n\nLike other Stoics, Epictetus regards the mind not as a separate\nincorporeal entity but as consisting of pneuma\n(\u201cbreath\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d), a material\nsubstance with certain remarkable powers. Thus he explains the faculty\nof vision by the activity of pneuma infused by god into the\neyes, as well as by the energy and tensility of the air through which\nthings are seen (2.23.3\u20134). In an especially striking analogy in\n3.3.20\u201322, he compares the mind to a vessel of water and mental\nimpressions to rays of light entering the water. When the water is\ndisturbed, the ray of light appears to move, but in fact does not; and\nlikewise when a person experiences vertigo, it seems as if the skills\nand virtues are disrupted, but in fact the disruption is only in the\npneuma in which they exist.\n5. Educational method\n\nEpictetus draws a sharp distinction between book learning, i.e.\nmastering the content of particular treatises, and what may be called\neducation for living, in which one acquires the attitudes and habits\nthat enable correct behavior. The latter is of paramount importance;\nthe former may be of instrumental value but if overemphasized may\nprove a hindrance to ethical development.\n\nThe program of study offered in the school at Nicopolis included the\nreading of philosophical treatises by Stoic authors of the Hellenistic\nperiod, for instance the work On Impulse by Chrysippus\n(1.4.14) and the logical writings of Archedemus (1.10.8). Frequent\nreferences to formal logical schemata suggest that these, too, were\ntaught, as they had been in the curriculum of Musonius Rufus,\nEpictetus\u2019s own teacher at Rome (1.7.32; cf. 1.7.5\u201312).\nFinally, there is some evidence for instruction in what the ancients\ncalled physics (philosophy of nature); for this, see 1.6.19\u201322\nwith Magrin (2012).\n\nEducation for living is primarily self-education, a function of that\ncapacity for self-correction which is inherent in our rational nature.\nEpictetus rejects the way of thinking that says moral improvement is\nachievable only by divine assistance.\n\nHave you not hands, fool? Has not god made them for you? Sit down now\nand pray your nose may not run! Wipe it, rather, and do not blame god.\n(2.16.11)\n\n\nThe example of Socrates serves to remind the hearer that intellectual\nindependence remains the primary objective. For while Socrates teaches\nothers, he is himself untaught or rather self-taught; his unshakeable\ncomprehension of ethical issues has been attained through rigorous\napplication of methods anyone might use. Admittedly, Socrates was\nexceptionally gifted, and yet his achievement is what all are born for\nand can at least hope to match (1.2.33\u201337).\n\nDirect coaching by a philosophical teacher may nonetheless be of\nassistance to persons seeking to correct their own dispositions.\nEpictetus explains the process in Discourses 3.2. Above all,\none must attend to \u201cdesire and aversion\u201d: one must correct\none\u2019s emotional responses by pondering questions of value and\nindifference, for desire or fear of objects outside one\u2019s own\ncontrol results in a host of strong emotions that make one\n\u201cincapable of listening to reason\u201d while experiencing\nthem. Further, one must study \u201cthe impulse to act and not to\nact,\u201d for vigorous action may be part of proper relations to the\ngods, to family members, and to the state, and those actions should be\norderly and well-considered. Finally, one must attend to one\u2019s\nown reasoning processes, to \u201cfreedom from deception and hasty\njudgment and in general whatever is concerned with assent.\u201d This\nlast entails some study of logic, to prevent the conclusions reached\nin the two principal areas of study from being dislodged \u201ceven\nin dreams or drunkenness or melancholy.\u201d\n\nThese three topics have rightly been regarded as the foundation of\nEpictetus\u2019s educational system, although (pace Hadot (1978)),\nthey are not to be identified with the three divisions of\nphilosophical discourse discussed by the early Stoics (viz. physics,\nethics, and logic; Diogenes Laertius 7.39\u201340). As presented in\n3.2, the schema seems intended primarily to deemphasize the role of\nlogic; that is, of the sterile conundrums and oversubtle analyses\nenjoyed by some of Epictetus\u2019s contemporaries. As Barnes (1997)\nhas shown, however, Epictetus is not at all averse to the study of\nlogic provided it is given its proper supporting role. Learning of\nthis kind may be instrumental in developing one\u2019s intellectual\nacumen, just as the weights used by athletes in their training serve\nto develop the muscles (1.4.13; 1.17).\n\nThe actual process of self-improvement is initially a matter of\nconsciously slowing down one\u2019s thought processes to allow for\nreflection prior to assent. \u201cImpression, wait for me a little.\nLet me see what you are, and what you represent\u201d (2.18.24). As\nthe habit of screening impressions becomes established, correct\nresponses will begin to come automatically. Yet constant vigilance is\nstill required, to guard against backsliding (4.3). One can never rely\nsolely on habituation.\n\nMore specific therapeutic techniques may also be of use to the one\nmaking ethical progress. Epictetus recommends that pupils refrain from\nusing the terms \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad,\u201d not because\nthose terms have no application in human life, but because they are\ntoo easily misapplied. Thus one should \u201csuppress\u201d desire\nand aversion, and use only plain, emotionally unadorned impulse and\ncounter-impulse (Encheiridion 2). To combat some individual\nbad habit, one should practice the opposite behavior: for instance, if\none is quick tempered, one should accustom oneself to bearing insults\nwith patience (3.12.6\u201312). Regular self-examination at\nbedtime\u2014a practice borrowed from the Pythagorean\ntradition\u2014will enable one to correct errors before they become\ningrained (3.10.1).\n\nOccasionally Epictetus offers pre-professional advice to pupils who\nintend to pursue a teaching career of their own. He chastises the\nteacher who assigns a technical treatise in logic without providing\nany preliminary training or assessing the pupil\u2019s capabilities\n(1.23.13). In Discourses 3.23.33 he distinguishes three\n\u201cmodes\u201d or \u201ccharacters\u201d of philosophical\ndiscourse. The \u201cprotreptic\u201d mode is that which convinces\nhearers, singly or in groups, to care about philosophical study as a\nmeans toward personal ethical development. The \u201celenctic\u201d\nmode, named from the Socratic elenchos, is more\nconfrontational and is aimed at removing false convictions, while the\n\u201cinstructional\u201d mode imparts sound doctrines. As Long\n(2002) has noted, the three modes are associated respectively with\nDiogenes the Cynic, with Socrates, and with Zeno of Citium, the\nfounder of the Stoic school (3.21.19; cf. 2.12.5).\n6. Influence\n\nThough much cultivated in person by the nobles of local Greek cities\n(as Brunt 1997 describes), Epictetus exerted far more influence\nthrough the written works produced by Arrian. The emperor Marcus\nAurelius was never in fact his pupil, but was so deeply impressed with\nwhat he had read as to consider himself a follower of the freedman\nphilosopher. In the early third century Origen remarks on the\npopularity of Epictetus with his own contemporaries, which he finds to\nrival that of Plato (Contra Celsum 6.2). Whether Origen was\nhimself much influenced by Epictetus\u2019s version of Stoicism is\nanother matter, for Origen had studied the writings of Chrysippus on\nhis own account and the strands cannot easily be separated. More\ndemonstrable is the homage paid to Epictetus by Simplicius, the\nsixth-century Aristotle commentator, who composed a long philosophical\ncommentary on the Encheiridion combining Stoic elements with\nhis own Neoplatonism.\n\nThe Encheiridion was translated into Latin by Poliziano in\n1497 and during the subsequent two centuries became exceptionally\npopular in Europe. Spanneut (1972) traces its use in monasteries in\nsuperficially Christianized form. Seventeenth-century intellectuals\nlike Guillaume du Vair, Justus Lipsius, and Thomas Gataker generally\nfound Epictetus\u2019s Stoicism to be fully compatible with\nChristianity; see the discussion in Brooke (2006). Pascal reacted\nagainst this perception; he admired Epictetus as a moralist but\nregarded it as sheer arrogance to believe that the human psyche is\npart of the divine and can be perfected by one\u2019s own efforts.\nDescartes adopted a recognizably Epictetan value system as part of his\npersonal ethics. An engagingly satirical portrayal of the potential\nimpact of Epictetus\u2019s philosophy in contemporary American life\nmay be found in Tom Wolfe\u2019s 1998 novel A Man in\nFull.",
