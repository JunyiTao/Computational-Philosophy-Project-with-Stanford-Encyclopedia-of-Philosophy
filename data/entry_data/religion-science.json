    "main_text": "\n1. Science, religion, and how they interrelate\n1.1 A brief history\n\nSince the 1960s, scholars in theology, philosophy, history, and the\nsciences have studied the relationship between science and religion.\nScience and religion is a recognized field of study with dedicated\njournals (e.g., Zygon: Journal of Religion and Science),\nacademic chairs (e.g., the Andreas Idreos Professor of Science and\nReligion at Oxford University), scholarly societies (e.g., the Science\nand Religion Forum), and recurring conferences (e.g., the European\nSociety for the Study of Science and Theology\u2019s biennial\nmeetings). Most of its authors are theologians (e.g., John Haught,\nSarah Coakley), philosophers with an interest in science (e.g., Nancey\nMurphy), or (former) scientists with long-standing interests in\nreligion, some of whom are also ordained clergy (e.g., the physicist\nJohn Polkinghorne, the molecular biophysicist Alister McGrath, and the\natmospheric scientist Katharine Hayhoe). Recently, authors in science\nand religion also have degrees in that interdisciplinary field (e.g.,\nSarah Lane Ritchie).\n\nThe systematic study of science and religion started in the 1960s,\nwith authors such as Ian Barbour (1966) and Thomas F. Torrance (1969)\nwho challenged the prevailing view that science and religion were\neither at war or indifferent to each other. Barbour\u2019s Issues\nin Science and Religion (1966) set out several enduring themes of\nthe field, including a comparison of methodology and theory in both\nfields. Zygon, the first specialist journal on science and\nreligion, was also founded in 1966. While the early study of science\nand religion focused on methodological issues, authors from the late\n1980s to the 2000s developed contextual approaches, including detailed\nhistorical examinations of the relationship between science and\nreligion (e.g., Brooke 1991). Peter Harrison (1998) challenged the\nwarfare model by arguing that Protestant theological conceptions of\nnature and humanity helped to give rise to science in the seventeenth\ncentury. Peter Bowler (2001, 2009) drew attention to a broad movement\nof liberal Christians and evolutionists in the nineteenth and\ntwentieth centuries who aimed to reconcile evolutionary theory with\nreligious belief. In the 1990s, the Vatican Observatory (Castel\nGandolfo, Italy) and the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences\n(Berkeley, California) co-sponsored a series of conferences on divine\naction and how it can be understood in the light of various\ncontemporary sciences. This resulted in six edited volumes (see\nRussell, Murphy, & Stoeger 2008 for a book-length summary of the\nfindings of this project). \n\nThe field has presently diversified so much that contemporary\ndiscussions on religion and science tend to focus on specific\ndisciplines and questions. Rather than ask if religion and science\n(broadly speaking) are compatible, productive questions focus on\nspecific topics. For example, Buddhist modernists (see\n section 2.4)\n have argued that Buddhist theories about the self (the no-self) and\nBuddhist practices, such as mindfulness meditation, are compatible and\nare corroborated by neuroscience.\n\nIn the contemporary public sphere, a prominent interaction between\nscience and religion concerns evolutionary theory and\ncreationism/Intelligent Design. The legal battles (e.g., the\nKitzmiller versus Dover trial in 2005) and lobbying surrounding the\nteaching of evolution and creationism in American schools suggest\nthere\u2019s a conflict between religion and science. However, even\nif one were to focus on the reception of evolutionary theory, the\nrelationship between religion and science is complex. For instance, in\nthe United Kingdom, scientists, clergy, and popular writers (the\nso-called Modernists), sought to reconcile science and religion during\nthe late nineteenth and early twentieth century, whereas the US saw the\nrise of a fundamentalist opposition to evolutionary thinking,\nexemplified by the Scopes trial in 1925 (Bowler 2001, 2009).\n\nAnother prominent offshoot of the discussion on science and religion\nis the New Atheist movement, with authors such as Richard Dawkins, Sam\nHarris, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens. They argue that\npublic life, including government, education, and policy should be\nguided by rational argument and scientific evidence, and that any form\nof supernaturalism (especially religion, but also, e.g., astrology)\nhas no place in public life. They treat religious claims, such as the\nexistence of God, as testable scientific hypotheses (see, e.g.,\nDawkins 2006).\n\nIn recent decades, the leaders of some Christian churches have issued\nconciliatory public statements on evolutionary theory. Pope John Paul\nII (1996) affirmed evolutionary theory in his message to the\nPontifical Academy of Sciences, but rejected it for the human soul,\nwhich he saw as the result of a separate, special creation. The Church\nof England publicly endorsed evolutionary theory (e.g., C. M. Brown\n2008), including an apology to Charles Darwin for its initial\nrejection of his theory.\n\nThis entry will focus on the relationship between religious and\nscientific ideas as rather abstract philosophical positions, rather\nthan as practices. However, this relationship has a large practical\nimpact on the lives of religious people and scientists (including\nthose who are both scientists and religious believers). A rich\nsociological literature indicates the complexity of these\ninteractions, among others, how religious scientists conceive of this\nrelationship (for recent reviews, see Ecklund 2010, 2021; Ecklund\n& Scheitle 2007; Gross & Simmons 2009).\n\nFor the past fifty years, the discussion on science and religion has\nde facto been on Western science and Christianity: to what\nextent can the findings of Western sciences be reconciled with\nChristian beliefs? The field of science and religion has only recently\nturned to an examination of non-Christian traditions, providing a\nricher picture of interaction.\n1.2 What is science, and what is religion?\n\nIn order to understand the scope of science and religion and their\ninteractions, we must at least get a rough sense of what science and\nreligion are. After all, \u201cscience\u201d and\n\u201creligion\u201d are not eternally unchanging terms with\nunambiguous meanings. Indeed, they are terms that were coined\nrecently, with meanings that vary across contexts. Before the\nnineteenth century, the term \u201creligion\u201d was rarely used.\nFor a medieval author such as Aquinas, the term religio meant\npiety or worship, and was not applied to religious systems\noutside of what he considered orthodoxy (Harrison 2015). The term\n\u201creligion\u201d obtained its considerably broader current\nmeaning through the works of early anthropologists, such as E.B. Tylor\n(1871), who systematically used the term for religions across the\nworld. As a result, \u201creligion\u201d became a comparative\nconcept, referring to traits that could be compared and scientifically\nstudied, such as rituals, dietary restrictions, and belief systems\n(Jonathan Smith 1998).\n\nThe term \u201cscience\u201d as it is currently used also became\ncommon in the nineteenth century. Prior to this, what we call\n\u201cscience\u201d fell under the terminology of \u201cnatural\nphilosophy\u201d or, if the experimental part was emphasized,\n\u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d. William Whewell (1834)\nstandardized the term \u201cscientist\u201d to refer to\npractitioners of diverse natural philosophies. Philosophers of science\nhave attempted to demarcate science from other knowledge-seeking\nendeavors, in particular religion. For instance, Karl Popper (1959)\nclaimed that scientific hypotheses (unlike religious and philosophical\nones) are in principle falsifiable. Many authors (e.g., Taylor 1996)\naffirm a disparity between science and religion, even if the meanings\nof both terms are historically contingent. They disagree, however, on\nhow to precisely (and across times and cultures) demarcate the two\ndomains.\n\nOne way to distinguish between science and religion is the claim that\nscience concerns the natural world, whereas religion concerns the\nsupernatural world and its relationship to the natural. Scientific\nexplanations do not appeal to supernatural entities such as gods or\nangels (fallen or not), or to non-natural forces (such as miracles,\nkarma, or qi). For example, neuroscientists typically explain\nour thoughts in terms of brain states, not by reference to an\nimmaterial soul or spirit, and legal scholars do not invoke karmic\nload when discussing why people commit crimes.\n\nNaturalists draw a distinction between methodological\nnaturalism, an epistemological principle that limits scientific\ninquiry to natural entities and laws, and ontological or\nphilosophical naturalism, a metaphysical principle that rejects\nthe supernatural (Forrest 2000). Since methodological naturalism is\nconcerned with the practice of science (in particular, with the kinds\nof entities and processes that are invoked), it does not make any\nstatements about whether or not supernatural entities exist. They\nmight exist, but lie outside of the scope of scientific investigation.\nSome authors (e.g., Rosenberg 2014) hold that taking the results of\nscience seriously entails negative answers to such persistent\nquestions into the existence of free will or moral knowledge. However,\nthese stronger conclusions are controversial.\n\nThe view that science can be demarcated from religion in its\nmethodological naturalism is more commonly accepted. For instance, in\nthe Kitzmiller versus Dover trial, the philosopher of science Robert\nPennock was called to testify by the plaintiffs on whether Intelligent\nDesign was a form of creationism, and therefore religion. If it were,\nthe Dover school board policy would violate the Establishment Clause\nof the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Building on\nearlier work (e.g., Pennock 1998), Pennock argued that Intelligent\nDesign, in its appeal to supernatural mechanisms, was not\nmethodologically naturalistic, and that methodological naturalism is\nan essential component of science. \n\nMethodological naturalism is a recent development in the history of\nscience, though we can see precursors of it in medieval authors such\nas Aquinas who attempted to draw a theological distinction\nbetween miracles, such as the working of relics, and unusual natural\nphenomena, such as magnetism and the tides (see Perry & Ritchie\n2018). Natural and experimental philosophers such as Isaac Newton,\nJohannes Kepler, Robert Hooke, and Robert Boyle regularly appealed to\nsupernatural agents in their natural philosophy (which we now call\n\u201cscience\u201d). Still, overall there was a tendency to favor\nnaturalistic explanations in natural philosophy. The X-club was a\nlobby group for the professionalization of science founded in 1864 by\nThomas Huxley and friends. While the X-club may have been in part\nmotivated by the desire to remove competition by amateur-clergymen\nscientists in the field of science, and thus to open up the field to\nfull-time professionals, its explicit aim was to promote a science\nthat would be free from religious dogma (Garwood 2008, Barton 2018).\nThis preference for naturalistic causes may have been encouraged by\npast successes of naturalistic explanations, leading authors such as\nPaul Draper (2005) to argue that the success of methodological\nnaturalism could be evidence for ontological naturalism. \n1.3 Taxonomies of the interaction between science and religion\n\nSeveral typologies probe the interaction between science and religion.\nFor example, Mikael Stenmark (2004) distinguishes between three views:\nthe independence view (no overlap between science and religion), the\ncontact view (some overlap between the fields), and a union of the\ndomains of science and religion; within these views he recognizes\nfurther subdivisions, e.g., contact can be in the form of conflict or\nharmony. The most influential taxonomy of the relationship between\nscience and religion remains Barbour\u2019s (2000): conflict,\nindependence, dialogue, and integration. Subsequent authors, as well\nas Barbour himself, have refined and amended this taxonomy. However,\nothers (e.g., Cantor & Kenny 2001) have argued that this taxonomy\nis not useful to understand past interactions between both fields.\nNevertheless, because of its enduring influence, it is still\nworthwhile to discuss it in detail.\n\nThe conflict model holds that science and religion are in\nperpetual and principal conflict. It relies heavily on two historical\nnarratives: the trial of Galileo (see Dawes 2016) and the reception of\nDarwinism (see Bowler 2001). Contrary to common conception, the\nconflict model did not originate in two seminal publications,\nnamely John Draper\u2019s (1874) History of the Conflict between\nReligion and Science and Andrew Dickson White\u2019s (1896)\ntwo-volume opus A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology\nin Christendom. Rather, as James Ungureanu (2019) argues, the\nproject of these early architects of the conflict thesis needs to be\ncontextualized in a liberal Protestant tradition of attempting to\nseparate religion from theology, and thus salvage religion. Their work\nwas later appropriated by skeptics and atheists who used their\narguments about the incompatibility of traditional theological views\nwith science to argue for secularization, something Draper and White\ndid not envisage.\n\nThe vast majority of authors in the science and religion field is\ncritical of the conflict model and believes it is based on a shallow\nand partisan reading of the historical record. While the conflict\nmodel is at present a minority position, some have used philosophical\nargumentation (e.g., Philipse 2012) or have carefully re-examined\nhistorical evidence such as the Galileo trial (e.g., Dawes 2016) to\nargue for this model. Alvin Plantinga (2011) has argued that the\nconflict is not between science and religion, but between science and\nnaturalism. In his Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism (first\nformulated in 1993), Plantinga argues that naturalism is epistemically\nself-defeating: if both naturalism and evolution are true, then\nit\u2019s unlikely we would have reliable cognitive faculties.\n\nThe independence model holds that science and religion\nexplore separate domains that ask distinct questions. Stephen Jay\nGould developed an influential independence model with his NOMA\nprinciple (\u201cNon-Overlapping Magisteria\u201d):\n\n\nThe lack of conflict between science and religion arises from a lack\nof overlap between their respective domains of professional expertise.\n(2001: 739)\n\n\nHe identified science\u2019s areas of expertise as empirical\nquestions about the constitution of the universe, and religion\u2019s\ndomain of expertise as ethical values and spiritual meaning. NOMA is\nboth descriptive and normative: religious leaders should refrain from\nmaking factual claims about, for instance, evolutionary theory, just\nas scientists should not claim insight on moral matters. Gould held\nthat there might be interactions at the borders of each magisterium,\nsuch as our responsibility toward other living things. One obvious\nproblem with the independence model is that if religion were barred\nfrom making any statement of fact, it would be difficult to justify\nits claims of value and ethics. For example, one could not argue that\none should love one\u2019s neighbor because it pleases the creator\n(Worrall 2004). Moreover, religions do seem to make empirical claims,\nfor example, that Jesus appeared after his death or that the early\nHebrews passed through the parted waters of the Red Sea.\n\nThe dialogue model proposes a mutualistic relationship\nbetween religion and science. Unlike independence, it assumes a common\nground between both fields, perhaps in their presuppositions, methods,\nand concepts. For example, the Christian doctrine of creation may have\nencouraged science by assuming that creation (being the product of a\ndesigner) is both intelligible and orderly, so one can expect there\nare laws that can be discovered. Creation, as a product of God\u2019s\nfree actions, is also contingent, so the laws of nature cannot be\nlearned through a priori thinking which prompts the need for\nempirical investigation. According to Barbour (2000), both scientific\nand theological inquiry are theory-dependent, or at least\nmodel-dependent. For example, the doctrine of the Trinity colors how\nChristian theologians interpret the first chapters of Genesis. Next\nto this, both rely on metaphors and models. Both fields remain\nseparate but they talk to each other, using common methods, concepts,\nand presuppositions. Wentzel van Huyssteen (1998) has argued for a\ndialogue position, proposing that science and religion can be in a\ngraceful duet, based on their epistemological overlaps. The Partially\nOverlapping Magisteria (POMA) model defended by Alister McGrath (e.g.,\nMcGrath and Collicutt McGrath 2007) is also worth mentioning.\nAccording to McGrath, science and religion each draw on several\ndifferent methodologies and approaches. These methods and approaches\nare different ways of knowing that have been shaped through historical\nfactors. It is beneficial for scientists and theologians to be in\ndialogue with each other.\n\nThe integration model is more extensive in its unification of\nscience and theology. Barbour (2000) identifies three forms of\nintegration. First, natural theology, which formulates arguments for\nthe existence and attributes of God. It uses interpretations of\nresults from the natural sciences as premises in its arguments. For\ninstance, the supposition that the universe has a temporal origin\nfeatures in contemporary cosmological arguments for the existence of\nGod. Likewise, the fact that the cosmological constants and laws of\nnature are life-permitting (whereas many other combinations of\nconstants and laws would not permit life) is used in contemporary\nfine-tuning arguments (see the entry to\n fine-tuning arguments).\n Second, theology of nature starts not from science but from a\nreligious framework, and examines how this can enrich or even revise\nfindings of the sciences. For example, McGrath (2016) developed a\nChristian theology of nature, examining how nature and scientific\nfindings can be interpreted through a Christian lens. Thirdly, Barbour\nbelieved that Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy was a promising way\nto integrate science and religion.\n\nWhile integration seems attractive (especially to theologians), it is\ndifficult to do justice to both the scientific and religious aspects\nof a given domain, especially given their complexities. For example,\nPierre Teilhard de Chardin (1971), who was both knowledgeable in\npaleoanthropology and theology, ended up with an unconventional view\nof evolution as teleological (which put him at odds with the\nscientific establishment) and with an unorthodox theology (which\ndenied original sin and led to a series of condemnations by the Roman\nCatholic Church). Theological heterodoxy, by itself, is no reason to\ndoubt a model. However, it shows obstacles for the integration model\nto become a live option in the broader community of theologians and\nphilosophers who want to remain affiliate to a specific religious\ncommunity without transgressing its boundaries. Moreover, integration\nseems skewed towards theism: Barbour described arguments based on\nscientific results that support (but do not demonstrate) theism, but\nfailed to discuss arguments based on scientific results that support\n(but do not demonstrate) the denial of theism. Hybrid positions like\nMcGrath\u2019s POMA indicate some difficulty for Barbour\u2019s\ntaxonomy: the scope of conflict, independence, dialogue, and\nintegration is not clearly defined and they are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, if conflict is defined broadly then it is\ncompatible with integration. Take the case of Frederick Tennant\n(1902), who sought to explain sin as the result of evolutionary\npressures on human ancestors. This view led him to reject the Fall as\na historical event, as it was not compatible with evolutionary\nbiology. His view has conflict (as he saw Christian doctrine in\nconflict with evolutionary biology) but also integration (he sought to\nintegrate the theological concept of sin in an evolutionary picture).\nIt is clear that many positions defined by authors in the religion and\nscience literature do not clearly fall within one of Barbour\u2019s\nfour domains.\n1.4 The scientific study of religion\n\nScience and religion are closely interconnected in the scientific\nstudy of religion, which can be traced back to seventeenth-century\nnatural histories of religion. Natural historians attempted to provide\nnaturalistic explanations for human behavior and culture, including\nreligion and morality. For example, Bernard Le Bovier de\nFontenelle\u2019s De l\u2019Origine des Fables (1724)\noffered a causal account of belief in the supernatural. People often\nassert supernatural explanations when they lack an understanding of\nthe natural causes underlying extraordinary events: \u201cTo the\nextent that one is more ignorant, or one has less experience, one sees\nmore miracles\u201d (1724 [1824: 295], my\ntranslation). Hume\u2019s Natural History of Religion (1757)\nis perhaps the best-known philosophical example of a natural\nhistorical explanation of religious belief. It traces the origins of\npolytheism\u2014which Hume thought was the earliest form of religious\nbelief\u2014to ignorance about natural causes combined with fear and\napprehension about the environment. By deifying aspects of the\nenvironment, early humans tried to persuade or bribe the gods, thereby\ngaining a sense of control.\n\nIn the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, authors from newly\nemerging scientific disciplines, such as anthropology, sociology, and\npsychology examined the purported naturalistic roots of religious\nbeliefs. They did so with a broad brush, trying to explain what\nunifies diverse religious beliefs across cultures. Auguste Comte\n(1841) proposed that all societies, in their attempts to make sense of\nthe world, go through the same stages of development: the theological\n(religious) stage is the earliest phase, where religious explanations\npredominate, followed by the metaphysical stage (a non-intervening\nGod), and culminating in the positive or scientific stage, marked by\nscientific explanations and empirical observations.\n\nIn anthropology, this positivist idea influenced cultural\nevolutionism, a theoretical framework that sought to explain cultural\nchange using universal patterns. The underlying supposition was that\nall cultures evolve and progress along the same trajectory. Cultures\nwith differing religious views were explained as being in different\nstages of their development. For example, Tylor (1871) regarded\nanimism as the earliest form of religious belief. James Frazer\u2019s\nGolden Bough (1890) is somewhat unusual within this\nliterature, as he saw commonalities between magic, religion, and\nscience. Though he proposed a linear progression, he also argued that\na proto-scientific mindset gave rise to magical practices, including\nthe discovery of regularities in nature. Cultural evolutionist models\ndealt poorly with religious diversity and with the complex\nrelationships between science and religion across cultures. Many\nauthors proposed that religion was just a stage in human development,\nwhich would eventually be superseded. For example, social theorists\nsuch as Karl Marx and Max Weber proposed versions of the\nsecularization thesis, the view that religion would decline in the\nface of modern technology, science, and culture.\n\nFunctionalism was another theoretical framework that sought to explain\nreligion. Functionalists did not consider religion to be a stage in\nhuman cultural development that would eventually be overcome. They saw\nit as a set of social institutions that served important functions in\nthe societies they were part of. For example, the sociologist\n\u00c9mile Durkheim (1912 [1915]) argued that religious beliefs are\nsocial glue that helps to keep societies together.\n\nSigmund Freud and other early psychologists aimed to explain religion\nas the result of cognitive dispositions. For example, Freud (1927) saw\nreligious belief as an illusion, a childlike yearning for a fatherly\nfigure. He also considered \u201coceanic feeling\u201d (a feeling of\nlimitlessness and of being connected with the world, a concept he\nderived from the French author Romain Rolland) as one of the origins\nof religious belief. He thought this feeling was a remnant of an\ninfant\u2019s experience of the self, prior to being weaned off the\nbreast. William James (1902) was interested in the psychological roots\nand the phenomenology of religious experiences, which he believed were\nthe ultimate source of all institutional religions.\n\nFrom the 1920s onward, the scientific study of religion became less\nconcerned with grand unifying narratives, and focused more on\nparticular religious traditions and beliefs. Anthropologists such as\nEdward Evans-Pritchard (1937) and Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski (1925) no\nlonger relied exclusively on second-hand reports (usually of poor\nquality and from distorted sources), but engaged in serious fieldwork.\nTheir ethnographies indicated that cultural evolutionism was a\ndefective theoretical framework and that religious beliefs were more\ndiverse than was previously assumed. They argued that religious\nbeliefs were not the result of ignorance of naturalistic mechanisms.\nFor instance, Evans-Pritchard (1937) noted that the Azande were well\naware that houses could collapse because termites ate away at their\nfoundations, but they still appealed to witchcraft to explain why a\nparticular house collapsed at a particular time. More recently,\nCristine Legare et al. (2012) found that people in various cultures\nstraightforwardly combine supernatural and natural explanations, for\ninstance, South Africans are aware AIDS is caused by the HIV virus,\nbut some also believe that the viral infection is ultimately caused by\na witch.\n\nPsychologists and sociologists of religion also began to doubt that\nreligious beliefs were rooted in irrationality, psychopathology, and\nother atypical psychological states, as James (1902) and other early\npsychologists had assumed. In the US, in the late 1930s through the\n1960s, psychologists developed a renewed interest for religion, fueled\nby the observation that religion refused to decline and seemed to\nundergo a substantial revival, thus casting doubt on the\nsecularization thesis (see Stark 1999 for an overview). Psychologists\nof religion have made increasingly fine-grained distinctions between\ntypes of religiosity, including extrinsic religiosity (being religious\nas means to an end, for instance, getting the benefits of being a\nmember of a social group) and intrinsic religiosity (people who adhere\nto religions for the sake of their teachings) (Allport & Ross\n1967). Psychologists and sociologists now commonly study religiosity\nas an independent variable, with an impact on, for instance, health,\ncriminality, sexuality, socio-economic profile, and social\nnetworks.\n\nA recent development in the scientific study of religion is the\ncognitive science of religion (CSR). This is a multidisciplinary\nfield, with authors from, among others, developmental psychology,\nanthropology, philosophy, and cognitive psychology (see C. White 2021\nfor a comprehensive overview). It differs from other scientific\napproaches to religion in its presupposition that religion is not a\npurely cultural phenomenon. Rather, authors in CSR hold that religion\nis the result of ordinary, early developed, and universal human\ncognitive processes (e.g., Barrett 2004, Boyer 2002). Some authors\nregard religion as the byproduct of cognitive processes that are not\nevolved for religion. For example, according to Paul Bloom (2007),\nreligion emerges as a byproduct of our intuitive distinction between\nminds and bodies: we can think of minds as continuing, even after the\nbody dies (e.g., by attributing desires to a dead family member),\nwhich makes belief in an afterlife and in disembodied spirits natural\nand spontaneous. Another family of hypotheses regards religion as a\nbiological or cultural adaptive response that helps humans solve\ncooperative problems (e.g., Bering 2011; Purzycki & Sosis 2022):\nthrough their belief in big, powerful gods that can punish, humans\nbehave more cooperatively, which allowed human group sizes to expand\nbeyond small hunter-gatherer communities. Groups with belief in big\ngods thus out-competed groups without such beliefs for resources\nduring the Neolithic, which would explain the current success of\nbelief in such gods (Norenzayan 2013). However, the question of which\ncame first\u2014big god beliefs or large-scale societies\u2014is a\ncontinued matter of debate.\n2. Science and religion in various religions\n\nAs noted, most studies on the relationship between science and\nreligion have focused on science and Christianity, with only a small\nnumber of publications devoted to other religious traditions (e.g.,\nBrooke & Numbers 2011; Lopez 2008). Since science makes universal\nclaims, it is easy to assume that its encounter with other religious\ntraditions would be similar to its interactions with Christianity.\nHowever, given different creedal tenets (e.g., in Hindu traditions God\nis usually not entirely distinct from creation, unlike in Christianity\nand Judaism), and because science has had distinct historical\ntrajectories in other cultures, one can expect disanalogies in the\nrelationship between science and religion in different religious\ntraditions. To give a sense of this diversity, this section provides a\nbird\u2019s eye view of science and religion in five major world\nreligions: Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism.\n2.1 Christianity\n\nChristianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion, currently the\nreligion with the most adherents. It developed in the first century CE\nout of Judaism. Christians adhere to asserted revelations described in\na series of canonical texts, which include the Old Testament, which\ncomprises texts inherited from Judaism, and the New Testament, which\ncontains the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John (narratives on\nthe life and teachings of Jesus), as well as events and teachings of\nthe early Christian churches (e.g., Acts of the Apostles, letters by\nPaul), and Revelation, a prophetic book on the end times.\n\nGiven the prominence of revealed texts in Christianity, a useful\nstarting point to examine the relationship between Christianity and\nscience is the two books metaphor (see Tanzella-Nitti 2005 for an\noverview): God revealed Godself through the \u201cBook of\nNature\u201d, with its orderly laws, and the \u201cBook of\nScripture\u201d, with its historical narratives and accounts of\nmiracles. Augustine (354\u2013430) argued that the book of nature was\nthe more accessible of the two, since scripture requires literacy\nwhereas illiterates and literates alike could read the book of nature.\nMaximus Confessor (c. 580\u2013662), in his Ambigua (see\nLouth 1996 for a collection of and critical introduction to these\ntexts) compared scripture and natural law to two clothes that\nenvelop the Incarnated Logos: Jesus\u2019 humanity is revealed by\nnature, whereas his divinity is revealed by the scriptures. During the\nMiddle Ages, authors such as Hugh of St. Victor (ca. 1096\u20131141)\nand Bonaventure (1221\u20131274) began to realize that the book of\nnature was not at all straightforward to read. Given that original sin\nmarred our reason and perception, what conclusions could humans\nlegitimately draw about ultimate reality? Bonaventure used the\nmetaphor of the books to the extent that \u201cliber\nnaturae\u201d was a synonym for creation, the natural world. He\nargued that sin has clouded human reason so much that the book of\nnature has become unreadable, and that scripture is needed as an aid\nas it contains teachings about the world.\n\nChristian authors in the field of science and religion continue to\ndebate how these two books interrelate. Concordism is the attempt to\ninterpret scripture in the light of modern science. It is a\nhermeneutical approach to Bible interpretation, where one expects that\nthe Bible foretells scientific theories, such as the Big Bang theory\nor evolutionary theory. However, as Denis Lamoureux (2008: chapter 5)\nargues, many scientific-sounding statements in the Bible are false:\nthe mustard seed is not the smallest seed, male reproductive seeds do\nnot contain miniature persons, there is no firmament, and the earth is\nneither flat nor immovable. Thus, any plausible form of integrating\nthe book of nature and scripture will require more nuance and\nsophistication. Theologians such as John Wesley (1703\u20131791) have\nproposed the addition of other sources of knowledge to scripture and\nscience: the Wesleyan quadrilateral (a term not coined by Wesley\nhimself) is the dynamic interaction of scripture, experience\n(including the empirical findings of the sciences), tradition, and\nreason (Outler 1985).\n\nSeveral Christian authors have attempted to integrate science and\nreligion (e.g., Haught 1995, Lamoureux 2008, Murphy 1995), making\nintegration a highly popular view on the relationship between science\nand religion. These authors tend to interpret findings from the\nsciences, such as evolutionary theory or chaos theory, in a\ntheological light, using established theological models such as\nclassical theism or the doctrine of creation. John Haught (1995)\nargues that the theological view of kenosis (self-emptying of God in\ncreation) anticipates scientific findings such as evolutionary theory:\na self-emptying God (i.e., who limits Godself), who creates a distinct\nand autonomous world, makes a world with internal self-coherence, with\na self-organizing universe as the result.\n\nThe dominant epistemological outlook in Christian science and religion\nhas been critical realism, a position that applies both to theology\n(theological realism) and to science (scientific realism). Barbour\n(1966) introduced this view into the science and religion literature;\nit has been further developed by theologians such as Arthur Peacocke\n(1984) and Wentzel van Huyssteen (1999). Critical realism aims to\noffer a middle way between na\u00efve realism (the world is as we\nperceive it) and instrumentalism (our perceptions and concepts are\npurely instrumental). It encourages critical reflection on perception\nand the world, hence \u201ccritical\u201d. Critical realism has\ndistinct flavors in the works of different authors, for instance, van\nHuyssteen (1998, 1999) develops a weak form of critical realism set\nwithin a postfoundationalist notion of rationality, where theological\nviews are shaped by social, cultural, and evolved biological factors.\nMurphy (1995: 329\u2013330) outlines doctrinal and scientific\nrequirements for approaches in science and religion: ideally, an\nintegrated approach should be broadly in line with Christian doctrine,\nespecially core tenets such as the doctrine of creation, while at the\nsame time it should be in line with empirical observations without\nundercutting scientific practices.\n\nSeveral historians (e.g., Hooykaas 1972) have argued that Christianity\nwas instrumental to the development of Western science. Peter Harrison\n(2007) maintains that the doctrine of original sin played a crucial\nrole in this, arguing there was a widespread belief in the early\nmodern period that Adam, prior to the Fall, had superior senses,\nintellect, and understanding. As a result of the Fall, human senses\nbecame duller, our ability to make correct inferences was diminished,\nand nature itself became less intelligible. Postlapsarian humans\n(i.e., humans after the Fall) are no longer able to exclusively rely\non their a priori reasoning to understand nature. They must\nsupplement their reasoning and senses with observation through\nspecialized instruments, such as microscopes and telescopes. As the\nexperimental philosopher Robert Hooke wrote in the introduction to his\nMicrographia:\n\n\nevery man, both from a deriv\u2019d corruption, innate and born with\nhim, and from his breeding and converse with men, is very subject to\nslip into all sorts of errors \u2026 These being the dangers in the\nprocess of humane Reason, the remedies of them all can only proceed\nfrom the real, the mechanical, the experimental Philosophy\n[experiment-based science]. (1665, cited in Harrison 2007: 5)\n\n\nAnother theological development that may have facilitated the rise of\nscience was the Condemnation of Paris (1277), which forbade teaching\nand reading natural philosophical views that were considered\nheretical, such as Aristotle\u2019s physical treatises. As a result,\nthe Condemnation opened up intellectual space to think beyond ancient\nGreek natural philosophy. For example, medieval philosophers such as\nJohn Buridan (fl. 14th c) held the Aristotelian belief that there\ncould be no vacuum in nature, but once the idea of a vacuum became\nplausible, natural philosophers such as Evangelista Torricelli\n(1608\u20131647) and Blaise Pascal (1623\u20131662) could experiment\nwith air pressure and vacua (see Grant 1996, for discussion).\n\nSome authors claim that Christianity was unique and instrumental in\ncatalyzing the scientific revolution. For example, according to the\nsociologist of religion Rodney Stark (2004), the scientific revolution\nwas in fact a slow, gradual development from medieval Christian\ntheology. Claims such as Stark\u2019s, however, fail to recognize the\nlegitimate contributions of Islamic and Greek scholars to the\ndevelopment of modern science, and fail to do justice to the\nimportance of practical technological innovations in map-making and\nstar-charting in the emergence of modern science. In spite of these\npositive readings of the relationship between science and religion in\nChristianity, there are sources of enduring tension. For example,\nthere is still vocal opposition to the theory of evolution among\nChristian fundamentalists. In the public sphere, the conflict view\nbetween Christianity and science prevails, in stark contrast to the\nscholarly literature. This is due to an important extent to the\noutsize influence of a vocal conservative Christian minority in the\nAmerican public debate, which sidelines more moderate voices (Evans\n2016).\n2.2 Islam\n\nIslam is a monotheistic religion that emerged in the seventh century,\nfollowing a series of purported revelations to the prophet\nMu\u1e25ammad. The term \u201cIslam\u201d also denotes\ngeo-political structures, such as caliphates and empires, which were\nfounded by Muslim rulers from the seventh century onward, including\nthe Umayyad, Abbasid, and Ottoman caliphates. Additionally, it refers\nto a culture which flourished within this political and religious\ncontext, with its own philosophical and scientific traditions (Dhanani\n2002). The defining characteristic of Islam is belief in one God\n(All\u0101h), who communicates through prophets, including Adam,\nAbraham, and Mu\u1e25ammad. All\u0101h\u200e\u2019s revelations to\nMu\u1e25ammad are recorded in the Qur\u02be\u0101n, the central\nreligious text for Islam. Next to the Qur\u02be\u0101n, an important\nsource of jurisprudence and theology is the \u1e25ad\u012bth, an oral\ncorpus of attested sayings, actions, and tacit approvals of the\nprophet Mu\u1e25ammad. The two major branches of Islam, Sunni and\nShia, are based on a dispute over the succession of Mu\u1e25ammad. As\nthe second largest religion in the world, Islam shows a wide variety\nof beliefs. Core creedal views include the oneness of God\n(taw\u1e25\u012bd), the view that there is only one\nundivided God who created and sustains the universe, prophetic\nrevelation (in particular to Mu\u1e25ammad), and an afterlife. Beyond\nthis, Muslims disagree on a number of doctrinal issues.\n\nThe relationship between Islam and science is complex. Today,\npredominantly Muslim countries, such as the United Arabic Emirates,\nenjoy high urbanization and technological development, but they still\nunderperform in common metrics of scientific research, such as\npublications in leading journals and number of citations per\nscientist, compared to other regions outside of the west such as India\nand China (see Edis 2007). Some Muslims hold a number of\npseudoscientific ideas, some of which it shares with Christianity such\nas Old Earth creationism, whereas others are specific to Islam such as\nthe recreation of human bodies from the tailbone on the day of\nresurrection, and the superiority of prayer in treating lower-back\npain instead of conventional methods (Guessoum 2011: 4\u20135).\n\nThis contemporary lack of scientific prominence is remarkable given\nthat the Islamic world far exceeded European cultures in the range and\nquality of its scientific knowledge between approximately the ninth\nand the fifteenth century, excelling in domains such as mathematics\n(algebra and geometry, trigonometry in particular), astronomy\n(seriously considering, but not adopting, heliocentrism), optics, and\nmedicine. These domains of knowledge are commonly referred to as\n\u201cArabic science\u201d, to distinguish them from the pursuits of\nscience that arose in the west (Huff 2003). \u201cArabic\nscience\u201d is an imperfect term, as many of the practitioners were\nnot speakers of Arabic, hence the term \u201cscience in the Islamic\nworld\u201d is more accurate. Many scientists in the Islamic world\nwere polymaths, for example, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna,\n980\u20131037) is commonly regarded as one of the most significant\ninnovators, not only in philosophy, but also in medicine and\nastronomy. His Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia, was\na standard textbook in universities across Europe for many centuries\nafter his death. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (ca. 872\u2013ca. 950), a\npolitical philosopher from Damascus, also investigated music theory,\nscience, and mathematics. Omar Khayy\u00e1m (1048\u20131131)\nachieved lasting fame in disparate domains such as poetry, astronomy,\ngeography, and mineralogy. The Andalusian Ibn Ru\u0161d (Averroes,\n1126\u20131198) wrote on medicine, physics, astronomy, psychology,\njurisprudence, music, and geography, next to developing a Greek-inspired\nphilosophical theology.\n\nA major impetus for science in the Islamic world was the patronage of\nthe Abbasid caliphate (758\u20131258), centered in Baghdad. Early\nAbbasid rulers, such as Harun al-Rashid (ruled 786\u2013809) and his\nsuccessor Ab\u016b Ja\u02bffar Abdull\u0101h al-Ma\u2019m\u016bn\n(ruled 813\u2013833), were significant patrons of science. The former\nfounded the Bayt al-Hikma (House of Wisdom), which\ncommissioned translations of major works by Aristotle, Galen, and many\nPersian and Indian scholars into Arabic. It was cosmopolitan in its\noutlook, employing astronomers, mathematicians, and physicians from\nabroad, including Indian mathematicians and Nestorian (Christian)\nastronomers. Throughout the Islamic world, public libraries attached\nto mosques provided access to a vast compendium of knowledge, which\nspread Islam, Greek philosophy, and science. The use of a common\nlanguage (Arabic), as well as common religious and political\ninstitutions and flourishing trade relations encouraged the spread of\nscientific ideas throughout the Islamic world. Some of this\ntransmission was informal, e.g., correspondence between like-minded\npeople (see Dhanani 2002), some formal, e.g., in hospitals where\nstudents learned about medicine in a practical, master-apprentice\nsetting, and in astronomical observatories and academies. The decline\nand fall of the Abbasid caliphate dealt a blow to science in the Islamic world, but it\nremains unclear why it ultimately stagnated, and why it did not\nexperience something analogous to the scientific revolution in Western\nEurope. Note, the decline of science in the Islamic world should not\nbe generalized to other fields, such as philosophy and philosophical\ntheology, which continued to flourish after the Abbasid caliphate\nfell.\n\nSome liberal Muslim authors, such as Fatima Mernissi (1992), argue\nthat the rise of conservative forms of Islamic philosophical theology\nstifled more scientifically-minded natural philosophy. In the ninth to\nthe twelfth century, the Mu\u2019tazila (a philosophical theological\nschool) helped the growth of science in the Islamic world thanks to\ntheir embrace of Greek natural philosophy. But eventually, the\nMu\u2019tazila and their intellectual descendants lost their\ninfluence to more conservative brands of theology.\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s influential eleventh-century work,\nThe Incoherence of the Philosophers (Tah\u0101fut\nal-fal\u0101sifa), was a scathing and sophisticated critique of\nGreek-inspired Muslim philosophy, arguing that their metaphysical assumptions\ncould not be demonstrated. This book vindicated more orthodox Muslim\nreligious views. As Muslim intellectual life became more orthodox, it\nbecame less open to non-Muslim philosophical ideas, which led to the\ndecline of science in the Islamic world, according to this view.\n\nThe problem with this narrative is that orthodox worries about\nnon-Islamic knowledge were already present before Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\nand continued long after his death (Edis 2007: chapter 2). The study\nof law (fiqh) was more stifling for science in the Islamic\nworld than developments in theology. The eleventh century saw changes\nin Islamic law that discouraged heterodox thought: lack of orthodoxy\ncould now be regarded as apostasy from Islam (zandaqa) which\nis punishable by death, whereas before, a Muslim could only apostatize\nby an explicit declaration (Griffel 2009: 105). (Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\nhimself only regarded the violation of three core doctrines as\nzandaqa, namely statements that challenged monotheism, the\nprophecy of Mu\u1e25ammad, and resurrection after death.) Given that\nheterodox thoughts could be interpreted as apostasy, this created a\nstifling climate for science. In the second half of the nineteenth\ncentury, as science and technology became firmly entrenched in Western\nsociety, Muslim empires were languishing or colonized. Scientific\nideas, such as evolutionary theory, became equated with European\ncolonialism, and thus met with distrust. The enduring association\nbetween western culture, colonialism, and science led to a more\nprominent conflict view of the relationship between science and\nreligion in Muslim countries.\n\nIn spite of this negative association between science and Western\nmodernity, there is an emerging literature on science and religion by\nMuslim scholars (mostly scientists). The physicist Nidhal Guessoum\n(2011) holds that science and religion are not only compatible, but in\nharmony. He rejects the idea of treating the Qur\u02be\u0101n as a\nscientific encyclopedia, something other Muslim authors in the debate\non science and religion tend to do. Moreover, he adheres to the\nno-possible-conflict principle, outlined by Ibn Ru\u0161d: there\ncan be no conflict between God\u2019s word (properly understood) and\nGod\u2019s work (properly understood). If an apparent conflict\narises, the Qur\u02be\u0101n may not have been interpreted\ncorrectly.\n\nWhile the Qur\u02be\u0101n asserts a creation in six days (like the\nHebrew Bible), \u201cday\u201d is often interpreted as a very long\nspan of time, rather than a 24-hour period. As a result, Old Earth\ncreationism is more influential in Islam than Young Earth creationism.\nAdnan Oktar\u2019s Atlas of Creation (published in 2007\nunder the pseudonym Harun Yahya), a glossy coffee table book that\ndraws heavily on Christian Old Earth creationism, has been distributed\nworldwide (Hameed 2008). Since the Qur\u02be\u0101n explicitly\nmentions the special creation of Adam out of clay, most Muslims refuse\nto accept that humans evolved from hominin ancestors. Nevertheless,\nMuslim scientists such as Guessoum (2011) and Rana Dajani (2015) have\nadvocated acceptance of evolution.\n2.3 Hinduism\n\nHinduism is the world\u2019s third largest religion, though the term\n\u201cHinduism\u201d is an awkward catch-all phrase that denotes\ndiverse religious and philosophical traditions that emerged on the\nIndian subcontinent between 500 BCE and 300 CE. The vast majority of\nHindus live in India; most others live in Nepal, Sri Lanka, and\nSoutheast Asia, with a significant diaspora in western countries such\nas the United States (Hackett 2015\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n In contrast to the Abrahamic monotheistic religions, Hinduism does not\nalways draw a sharp distinction between God and creation. (While there\nare pantheistic and panentheistic views in Christianity, Judaism, and\nIslam, these are minority positions.) Many Hindus believe in a\npersonal God, and identify this God as immanent in creation. This view\nhas ramifications for the science and religion debate, in that there\nis no sharp ontological distinction between creator and creature\n(Subbarayappa 2011). Religious traditions originating on the Indian\nsubcontinent, including Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, are\nreferred to as dharmic religions. Philosophical points of view are\nreferred to as dar\u015bana. \n\nOne factor that unites the different strands of Hinduism is the\nimportance of foundational texts composed between ca. 1600 and 700\nBCE. These include the Vedas, which contain hymns and prescriptions\nfor performing rituals, Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, accompanying liturgical\ntexts, and Upani\u1e63ad, metaphysical treatises. The Vedas discuss\ngods who personify and embody natural phenomena such as fire (Agni)\nand wind (V\u0101yu). More gods appear in the following centuries\n(e.g., Ga\u1e47e\u015ba and Sati-Parvati in the 4th century). Note\nthat there are both polytheistic and monotheistic strands in Hinduism,\nso it is not the case that individual believers worship or recognize\nall of these gods. Ancient Vedic rituals encouraged knowledge of\ndiverse sciences, including astronomy, linguistics, and mathematics.\nAstronomical knowledge was required to determine the timing of rituals\nand the construction of sacrificial altars. Linguistics developed out\nof a need to formalize grammatical rules for classical Sanskrit, which\nwas used in rituals. Large public offerings also required the\nconstruction of elaborate altars, which posed geometrical problems and\nthus led to advances in geometry. Classic Vedic texts also frequently\nused very large numbers, for instance, to denote the age of humanity\nand the Earth, which required a system to represent numbers\nparsimoniously, giving rise to a 10-base positional system and a\nsymbolic representation for zero as a placeholder, which would later\nbe imported in other mathematical traditions (Joseph 1991 [2000]). In\nthis way, ancient Indian dharma encouraged the emergence of the\nsciences.\n\nAround the sixth\u2013fifth century BCE, the northern part of the\nIndian subcontinent experienced an extensive urbanization. In this\ncontext, medicine (\u0101yurveda) became standardized. This\nperiod also gave rise to a wide range of heterodox philosophical\nschools, including Buddhism, Jainism, and C\u0101rv\u0101ka. The\nlatter defended a form of metaphysical naturalism, denying the\nexistence of gods or karma. The relationship between science and\nreligion on the Indian subcontinent is complex, in part because the\ndharmic religions and philosophical schools are so diverse. For\nexample, C\u0101rv\u0101ka proponents had a strong suspicion of\ninferential beliefs, and rejected Vedic revelation and supernaturalism\nin general, instead favoring direct observation as a source of\nknowledge.\n\nNatural theology also flourished in the pre-colonial period,\nespecially in the Advaita Ved\u0101nta, a dar\u015bana that\nidentifies the self, \u0101tman, with ultimate reality,\nBrahman.  Advaita Ved\u0101ntin philosopher Adi \u015aa\u1e45kara\n(fl. first half eighth century) was an author who regarded Brahman as\nthe only reality, both the material and the efficient cause of the\ncosmos. \u015aa\u1e45kara formulated design and cosmological\narguments, drawing on analogies between the world and artifacts: in\nordinary life, we never see non-intelligent agents produce purposive\ndesign, yet the universe is suitable for human life, just like benches\nand pleasure gardens are designed for us. Given that the universe is\nso complex that even an intelligent craftsman cannot comprehend it,\nhow could it have been created by non-intelligent natural forces?\n\u015aa\u1e45kara concluded that it must have been designed by an\nintelligent creator (C.M. Brown 2008: 108).\n\nFrom 1757 to 1947, India was under British colonial rule. This had a\nprofound influence on its culture as Hindus came into contact with\nWestern science and technology. For local intellectuals, the contact\nwith Western science presented a challenge: how to assimilate these\nideas with Hinduism? Mahendrahal Sircar (1833\u20131904) was one of\nthe first authors to examine evolutionary theory and its implications\nfor Hindu religious beliefs. Sircar was an evolutionary theist, who\nbelieved that God used evolution to create current life forms.\nEvolutionary theism was not a new hypothesis in Hinduism, but the many\nlines of empirical evidence Darwin provided for evolution gave it a\nfresh impetus. While Sircar accepted organic evolution through common\ndescent, he questioned the mechanism of natural selection as it was\nnot teleological, which went against his evolutionary theism. This was\na widespread problem for the acceptance of evolutionary theory, one\nthat Christian evolutionary theists also wrestled with (Bowler 2009).\nHe also argued against the British colonists\u2019 beliefs that\nHindus were incapable of scientific thought, and encouraged fellow\nHindus to engage in science, which he hoped would help regenerate the\nIndian nation (C.M. Brown 2012: chapter 6).\n\nThe assimilation of Western culture prompted various revivalist\nmovements that sought to reaffirm the cultural value of Hinduism. They\nput forward the idea of a Vedic science, where all scientific findings\nare already prefigured in the Vedas and other ancient texts\n(e.g., Vivekananda 1904). This idea is still popular within\ncontemporary Hinduism, and is quite similar to ideas held by\ncontemporary Muslims, who refer to the Qur\u02be\u0101n as a harbinger\nof scientific theories.\n\nResponses to evolutionary theory were as diverse as Christian views on\nthis subject, ranging from creationism (denial of evolutionary theory\nbased on a perceived incompatibility with Vedic texts) to acceptance\n(see C.M. Brown 2012 for a thorough overview). Authors such as\nDayananda Saraswati (1930\u20132015) rejected evolutionary theory. By\ncontrast, Vivekananda (1863\u20131902), a proponent of the monistic\nAdvaita Ved\u0101nta enthusiastically endorsed evolutionary theory and\nargued that it is already prefigured in ancient Vedic texts. His\nintegrative view claimed that Hinduism and science are in harmony:\nHinduism is scientific in spirit, as is evident from its long history\nof scientific discovery (Vivekananda 1904). Sri Aurobindo Ghose, a\nyogi and Indian nationalist who was educated in the West, formulated a\nsynthesis of evolutionary thought and Hinduism. He interpreted the\nclassic avatara doctrine, according to which God incarnates\ninto the world repeatedly throughout time, in evolutionary terms. God\nthus appears first as an animal, later as a dwarf, then as a violent\nman (Rama), and then as Buddha, and as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He\nproposed a metaphysical picture where both spiritual evolution\n(reincarnation and avatars) and physical evolution are ultimately a\nmanifestation of God (Brahman). This view of reality as\nconsisting of matter (prak\u1e5bti) and consciousness\n(puru\u1e63a) goes back to s\u0101\u1e43khya, one\nof the orthodox Hindu dar\u015bana, but Aurobindo made\nexplicit reference to the divine, calling the process during which the\nsupreme Consciousness dwells in matter involution (Aurobindo,\n1914\u201318 [2005], see C.M. Brown 2007 for discussion).\n\nDuring the twentieth century, Indian scientists began to gain\nprominence, including C.V. Raman (1888\u20131970), a Nobel Prize\nwinner in physics, and Satyendra Nath Bose (1894\u20131974), a\ntheoretical physicist who described the behavior of photons\nstatistically, and who gave his name to bosons. However, these authors\nwere silent on the relationship between their scientific work and\ntheir religious beliefs. By contrast, the mathematician Srinivasa\nRamanujan (1887\u20131920) was open about his religious beliefs and\ntheir influence on his mathematical work. He claimed that the goddess\nNamagiri helped him to intuit solutions to mathematical problems.\nLikewise, Jagadish Chandra Bose (1858\u20131937), a theoretical\nphysicist, biologist, biophysicist, botanist, and archaeologist who\nworked on radio waves, saw the Hindu idea of unity reflected in the\nstudy of nature. He started the Bose institute in Kolkata in 1917, the\nearliest interdisciplinary scientific institute in India (Subbarayappa\n2011).\n2.4 Buddhism\n\nBuddhism, like the other religious traditions surveyed in this entry,\nencompasses many views and practices. The principal forms of Buddhism\nthat exist today are Therav\u0101da and Mah\u0101y\u0101na.\n(Vajray\u0101na, the tantric tradition of Buddhism, is also sometimes\nseen as a distinct form.) Therav\u0101da is the dominant form of\nBuddhism of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. It traditionally refers to\nmonastic and textual lineages associated with the study of the P\u0101li\nBuddhist Canon. Mah\u0101y\u0101na refers to a movement that likely\nbegan roughly four centuries after the Buddha\u2019s death; it became\nthe dominant form of Buddhism in East and Central Asia. It includes\nChan or Zen, and also tantric Buddhism, which today is found mostly in\nTibet, though East Asian forms also exist.\n\nBuddhism originated in the historical figure of the Buddha\n(historically, Gautama Buddha or Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama, ca.\n5th\u20134th century BCE). His teaching\ncentered on ethics as well as metaphysics, incapsulated in the Four\nNoble Truths (on suffering and its origin in human desires), and the\nNoble Eightfold Path (right view, right aspiration, right speech,\nright action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right\nconcentration) to end suffering and to break the cycle of rebirths,\nculminating in reaching Nirvana. Substantive metaphysical teachings\ninclude belief in karma, the no-self, and the cycle of rebirth.\n\nAs a response to colonialist attitudes, modern Buddhists since the\nnineteenth century have often presented Buddhism as harmonious with\nscience (Lopez 2008). The argument is roughly that since Buddhism\ndoesn\u2019t require belief in metaphysically substantive entities\nsuch as God, the soul, or the self (unlike, for example,\nChristianity), Buddhism should be easily compatible with the factual\nclaims that scientists make. (Note, however, that historically most\nBuddhist have believed in various forms of divine abode and\ndivinities.) We could thus expect the dialogue and integration view to\nprevail in Buddhism.  An exemplar for integration is the fourteenth\nDalai Lama, who is known for his numerous efforts to lead dialogue\nbetween religious people and scientists. He has extensively written on\nthe relationship between Buddhism and various scientific disciplines\nsuch as neuroscience and cosmology (e.g., Dalai Lama 2005, see also\nthe  Science and Philosophy in the Indian Buddhist Classics\nseries, a four-volume series conceived and compiled by the Dalai Lama,\ne.g., Jinpa 2017). Donald Lopez Jr (2008) identifies compatibility as\nan enduring claim in the debate on science and Buddhism, in spite of\nthe fact that what is meant by these concepts has shifted markedly\nover time. As David McMahan (2009) argues, Buddhism underwent profound\nshifts in response to modernity in the west as well as globally. In\nthis modern context, Buddhists have often asserted the compatibility\nof Buddhism with science, favorably contrasting their religion to\nChristianity in that respect.\n\nThe full picture of the relationship between Buddhism and religion is\nmore nuanced than one of wholesale acceptance of scientific claims. I\nwill here focus on East Asia, primarily Japan and China, and the\nreception of evolutionary theory in the early twentieth century to\ngive a sense of this more complex picture. The earliest translations\nof evolutionary thought in Japan and China were not drawn from\nDarwin\u2019s Origin of Species or Descent of Man,\nbut from works by authors who worked in Darwin\u2019s wake, such as\nErnst Haeckel and Thomas Huxley. For example, the earliest translated\nwritings on evolutionary theory in China was a compilation by Yan Fu\nentitled On Natural Evolution (Tianyan lun), which\nincorporated excerpts by Herbert Spencer and Thomas Huxley. This work\ndrew a close distinction between social Darwinism and biological\nevolution (Ritzinger 2013). Chinese and Japanese Buddhists received\nthese ideas in the context of western colonialism and imperialism.\nEast Asian intellectuals saw how western colonial powers competed with\neach other for influence on their territory, and discerned parallels\nbetween this and the Darwinian struggle for existence. As a result,\nsome intellectuals such as the Japanese political adviser and academic\nKat\u014d Hiroyuki (1836\u20131916) drew on Darwinian thought and\npopularized notions such as \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d to\njustify the foreign policies of the Meiji government (Burenina 2020).\nIt is in this context that we can situate Buddhist responses to\nevolutionary theory.\n\nBuddhists do not distinguish between human beings as possessing a soul\nand other animals as soulless. As we are all part of the cycle of\nrebirth, we have all been in previous lives various other beings,\nincluding birds, insects, and fish. The problem of the specificity of\nthe human soul does not even arise because of the no-self doctrine.\nNevertheless, as Justin Ritzinger (2013) points out, Chinese Buddhists\nin the 1920s and 1930s who were confronted with early evolutionary\ntheory did not accept Darwin\u2019s theory wholesale. In their view,\nthe central element of Darwinism\u2014the struggle for\nexistence\u2014was incompatible with Buddhism, with its emphasis on\ncompassion with other creatures. They rejected social Darwinism (which\nsought to engineer societies along Darwinian principles) because it\nwas incompatible with Buddhist ethics and metaphysics. Struggling to\nsurvive and to propagate was clinging onto worldly things. Taixu\n(1890\u20131947), a Chinese Reformer and Buddhist modernist, instead\nchose to appropriate Pyotr Kropotkin\u2019s evolutionary views,\nspecifically on mutual aid and altruism. The Russian anarchist \nargued that cooperation was central to evolutionary change, a view\nthat is currently also more mainstream. However, Kropotkin\u2019s\nview did not go far enough in Taixu\u2019s opinion because mutual aid\nstill requires a self. Only when one recognizes the no-self doctrine\ncould one dedicate oneself entirely to helping others, as bodhisattvas\ndo (Ritzinger 2013).\n\nSimilar dynamics can be seen in the reception of evolutionary theory\namong Japanese Buddhists. Evolutionary theory was introduced in Japan\nduring the early Meji period (1868\u20131912) when Japan opened\nitself to foreign trade and ideas. Foreign experts, such as the\nAmerican zoologist Edward S. Morse (1838\u20131925) shared their\nknowledge of the sciences with Japanese scholars. The latter were\ninterested in the social ramifications of Darwinism, particularly\nbecause they had access to translated versions of Spencer\u2019s and\nHuxley\u2019s work before they could read Darwin\u2019s. Japanese\nBuddhists of the Nichiren tradition accepted many elements of\nevolutionary theory, but they rejected other elements, notably the\nstruggle for existence, and randomness and chance, as this contradicts\nthe role of karma in one\u2019s circumstances at birth.\n\nAmong the advocates of the modern Nishiren Buddhist movement is Honda\nNissh\u014d (1867\u20131931). Honda emphasized the importance of\nretrogressions (in addition to progress, which was the main element in\nevolution that western authors such as Haeckel and Spencer\nconsidered). He strongly argued against social Darwinism, the\napplication of evolutionary principles in social engineering, on\nreligious grounds. He argued that we can accept humans are descended\nfrom apes without having to posit a pessimistic view of human nature\nthat sees us as engaged in a struggle for survival with fellow human\nbeings. Like Chinese Buddhists, Honda thought Kropotkin\u2019s thesis\nof mutual aid was more compatible with Buddhism, but he was suspicious\nof Kropotkin\u2019s anarchism (Burenina 2020). His work, like that of\nother East Asian Buddhists indicates that historically, Buddhists are\nnot passive recipients of western science but creative interpreters.\nIn some cases, their religious reasons for rejecting some metaphysical\nassumptions in evolutionary theory led them to anticipate recent\ndevelopments in biology, such as the recognition of cooperation as an\nevolutionary principle.\n2.5 Judaism\n\nJudaism is one of the three major Abrahamic monotheistic traditions,\nencompassing a range of beliefs and practices that express a covenant\nbetween God and the people of Israel. Central to both Jewish practice\nand beliefs is the study of texts, including the written Torah (the\nTanakh, sometimes called \u201cHebrew Bible\u201d), and the\n\u201cOral Law\u201d of Rabbinic Judaism, compiled in such works\nlike the Talmud. There is also a corpus of esoteric, mystical\ninterpretations of biblical texts, the Kabbalah, which has influenced\nJewish works on the relationship between science and religion. The\nKabbalah also had an influence on Renaissance and early modern\nChristian authors such as Pico Della Mirandola, whose work helped to\nshape the scientific revolution (see the entry on\n Giovanni Pico della Mirandola).\n The theologian Maimonides (Rabbi Moshe ben-Maimon, 1138\u20131204,\naka Rambam) had an enduring influence on Jewish thought up until\ntoday, also in the science and religion literature.\n\nMost contemporary strains of Judaism are Rabbinic, rather than\nbiblical, and this has profound implications for the relationship\nbetween religion and science. While both Jews and Evangelical\nChristians emphasize the reading of sacred texts, the Rabbinic\ntraditions (unlike, for example, the Evangelical Christian tradition)\nholds that reading and interpreting texts is far from straightforward.\nScripture should not be read in a simple literal fashion. This opens\nup more space for accepting scientific theories (e.g., Big Bang\ncosmology) that seem at odds with a simple literal reading of the\nTorah (e.g., the six-day creation in Genesis) (Mitelman 2011\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Moreover, most non-Orthodox Jews in the US identify as politically\nliberal, so openness to science may also be an identity marker given\nthat politically liberal people in the US have positive attitudes\ntoward science (Pew Forum, 2021\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nJewish thinkers have made substantive theoretical contributions to the\nrelationship between science and religion, which differ in interesting\nrespects from those seen in the literature written by Christian\nauthors. To give just a few examples, Hermann Cohen (1842\u20131918),\na prominent neo-Kantian German Jewish philosopher, thought of the\nrelationship between Judaism and science in the light of the advances\nin scientific disciplines and the increased participation of Jewish\nscholars in the sciences. He argued that science, ethics, and Judaism\nshould all be conceived of as distinct but complementary sciences.\nCohen believed that his Jewish religious community was facing an\nepistemic crisis. All references to God had become suspect due to an\nadherence to naturalism, at first epistemological, but fast becoming\nontological. Cohen saw the concept of a transcendent God as\nfoundational to both Jewish practice and belief, so he thought\nadherence to wholesale naturalism threatened both Jewish orthodoxy and\northopraxy. As Teri Merrick (2020) argues, Cohen suspected this was in\npart due to epistemic oppression and self-censuring (though Cohen did\nnot frame it in these terms). Because Jewish scientists wanted to\nretain credibility in the Christian majority culture, they underplayed\nand neglected the rich Jewish intellectual legacy in their practice.\nIn response to this intellectual crisis, Cohen proposed to reframe\nJewish thought and philosophy so that it would be recognized as both\ncontinuous with the tradition and essentially contributing to ethical\nand scientific advances. In this way, he reframed this tradition,\narticulating a broadly Kantian philosophy of science to combat a\nperceived conflict between Judaism and science (see the entry on\n Hermann Cohen\n for an in-depth discussion).\n\nJewish religious scholars have examined how science might influence\nreligious beliefs, and vice versa. Rather than a unified response we\nsee a spectrum of philosophical views, especially since the nineteenth\nand early twentieth century. As Shai Cherry (2003) surveys, Jewish\nscholars in the early twentieth century accepted biological evolution\nbut were hesitant about Darwinian natural selection as the mechanism.\nThe Latvian-born Israeli rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1865\u20131935)\nthought that religion and science are largely separate domains (a view\nsomewhat similar to Gould\u2019s NOMA), though he believed that there\nwas a possible flow from religion to science. For example, Kook\nchallenged the lack of directionality in Darwinian evolutionary\ntheory. Using readings of the Kabbalah (and Halakhah, Jewish law), he\nproposed that biological evolution fits in a larger picture of cosmic\nevolution towards perfection.\n\nBy contrast, the American rabbi Morcedai Kaplan (1881\u20131983)\nthought information flow between science and religion could go in both\ndirections, a view reminiscent to Barbour\u2019s dialogue position.\nHe repeatedly argued against scientism (the encroachment of science on\ntoo many aspects of human life, including ethics and religion), but he\nbelieved nevertheless we ought to apply scientific methods to\nreligion. He saw reality as an unfolding process without a\npre-ordained goal: it was progressive, but not teleologically\ndetermined. Kaplan emphasized the importance of morality (and\nidentified God as the source of this process), and conceptualized\nhumanity as not merely a passive recipient of evolutionary change, but\nan active participant, prefiguring work in evolutionary biology on the\nimportance of agency in evolution (e.g., Okasha 2018). Thus,\nKaplan\u2019s reception of scientific theories, especially evolution,\nled him to formulate an early Jewish process theology.\n\nReform Judaism endorses an explicit anti-conflict view on the\nrelationship between science and religion. For example, the Pittsburgh\nPlatform of 1885, the first document of the Reform rabbinate, has a\nstatement that explicitly says that science and Judaism are not in\nconflict: \n\n\nWe hold that the modern discoveries of scientific researches in the\ndomain of nature and history are not antagonistic to the doctrines of\nJudaism. \n\n\nThis Platform had an enduring influence on Reform Judaism over the\nnext decades. Secular Jewish scientists such as Albert Einstein,\nRichard Feynman, Douglas Daniel Kahneman, and Stephen J. Gould have\nalso reflected on the relationship between science and broader issues\nof existential significance, and have exerted considerable influence\non the science and religion debate.\n3. Central topics in the debate\n\nCurrent work in the field of science and religion encompasses a wealth\nof topics, including free will, ethics, human nature, and\nconsciousness. Contemporary natural theologians discuss fine-tuning,\nin particular design arguments based on it (e.g., R. Collins 2009),\nthe interpretation of multiverse cosmology, and the significance of\nthe Big Bang (see entries on\n  fine-tuning arguments and\n  natural theology and natural religion).\n For instance, authors such as Hud Hudson (2013)\nhave explored the idea that God has actualized the best of all\npossible multiverses. Here follows an overview of two topics that\ncontinue to generate substantial interest and debate: divine action\n(and the closely related topic of creation) and human origins. The\nfocus will be on Christian work in science and religion, due to its\nprevalence in the literature.\n3.1 Divine action and creation\n\nBefore scientists developed their views on cosmology and origins of\nthe world, Western cultures already had a doctrine of creation, based\non biblical texts (e.g., the first three chapters of Genesis and the\nbook of Revelation) and the writings of church fathers such as\nAugustine. This doctrine of creation has the following interrelated\nfeatures: first, God created the world ex nihilo, i.e., out\nof nothing. Differently put, God did not need any pre-existing\nmaterials to make the world, unlike, e.g., the Demiurge (from Greek\nphilosophy), who created the world from chaotic, pre-existing matter.\nSecond, God is distinct from the world; the world is not equal to or\npart of God (contra pantheism or panentheism) or a (necessary)\nemanation of God\u2019s being (contra Neoplatonism). Rather, God\ncreated the world freely. This introduces an asymmetry between creator\nand creature: the world is radically contingent upon God\u2019s\ncreative act and is also sustained by God, whereas God does not need\ncreation (Jaeger 2012b: 3). Third, the doctrine of creation holds that\ncreation is essentially good (this is repeatedly affirmed in Genesis\n1). The world does contain evil, but God does not directly cause this\nevil to exist. Moreover, God does not merely passively sustain\ncreation, but rather plays an active role in it, using special divine\nactions (e.g., miracles and revelations) to care for creatures.\nFourth, God made provisions for the end of the world, and will create\na new heaven and earth, in this way eradicating evil.\n\nViews on divine action are related to the doctrine of creation.\nTheologians commonly draw a distinction between general and special\ndivine action, but within the field of science and religion there is\nno universally accepted definition of these two concepts. One way to\ndistinguish them (Wildman 2008: 140) is to regard general divine\naction as the creation and sustenance of reality, and special divine\naction as the collection of specific providential acts, such as\nmiracles and revelations to prophets. Drawing this distinction allows\nfor creatures to be autonomous and indicates that God does not\nmicromanage every detail of creation. Still, the distinction is not\nalways clear-cut, as some phenomena are difficult to classify as\neither general or special divine action. For example, the Roman\nCatholic Eucharist (in which bread and wine become the body and blood\nof Jesus) or some healing miracles outside of scripture seem mundane\nenough to be part of general housekeeping (general divine action), but\nstill seem to involve some form of special intervention on God\u2019s\npart. Alston (1989) makes a related distinction between direct and\nindirect divine acts. God brings about direct acts without the use of\nnatural causes, whereas indirect acts are achieved through natural\ncauses. Using this distinction, there are four possible kinds of\nactions that God could do: God could not act in the world at all, God\ncould act only directly, God could act only indirectly, or God could\nact both directly and indirectly.\n\nIn the science and religion literature, there are two central\nquestions on creation and divine action. To what extent are the\nChristian doctrine of creation and traditional views of divine action\ncompatible with science? How can these concepts be understood within a\nscientific context, e.g., what does it mean for God to create and act?\nNote that the doctrine of creation says nothing about the age of the\nEarth, nor does it specify a mode of creation. This allows for a wide\nrange of possible views within science and religion, of which Young\nEarth creationism is but one that is consistent with scripture.\nIndeed, some scientific theories, such as the Big Bang theory, first\nproposed by the Belgian Roman Catholic priest and astronomer Georges\nLema\u00eetre (1927), look congenial to the doctrine of creation. The\ntheory is not in contradiction, and could be integrated into\ncreatio ex nihilo as it specifies that the universe\noriginated from an extremely hot and dense state around 13.8 billion\nyears ago (Craig 2003), although some philosophers have argued against\nthe interpretation that the universe has a temporal beginning (e.g.,\nPitts 2008).\n\nThe net result of scientific findings since the seventeenth century\nhas been that God was increasingly pushed into the margins. This\nencroachment of science on the territory of religion happened in two\nways: first, scientific findings\u2014in particular from geology and\nevolutionary theory\u2014challenged and replaced biblical accounts of\ncreation. Although the doctrine of creation does not contain details\nof the mode and timing of creation, the Bible was regarded as\nauthoritative, and that authority got eroded by the sciences. Second,\nthe emerging concept of scientific laws in seventeenth- and\neighteenth-century physics seemed to leave no room for special divine\naction. These two challenges will be discussed below, along with\nproposed solutions in the contemporary science and religion\nliterature.\n\nChristian authors have traditionally used the Bible as a source of\nhistorical information. Biblical exegesis of the creation narratives,\nespecially Genesis 1 and 2 (and some other scattered passages, such as\nin the Book of Job), remains fraught with difficulties. Are these\ntexts to be interpreted in a historical, metaphorical, or poetic\nfashion, and what are we to make of the fact that the order of\ncreation differs between these accounts (Harris 2013)? The Anglican\narchbishop James Ussher (1581\u20131656) used the Bible to date the\nbeginning of creation at 4004 BCE. Although such literalist\ninterpretations of the biblical creation narratives were not uncommon,\nand are still used by Young Earth creationists today, theologians\nbefore Ussher already offered alternative, non-literalist readings of\nthe biblical materials (e.g., Augustine De Genesi ad\nlitteram, 416). From the seventeenth century onward, the\nChristian doctrine of creation came under pressure from geology, with\nfindings suggesting that the Earth was significantly older than 4004\nBCE. From the eighteenth century on, natural philosophers, such as\nBeno\u00eet de Maillet, Lamarck, Chambers, and Darwin, proposed\ntransmutationist (what would now be called evolutionary) theories,\nwhich seem incompatible with scriptural interpretations of the special\ncreation of species. Following the publication of Darwin\u2019s\nOrigin of Species (1859), there has been an ongoing\ndiscussion on how to reinterpret the doctrine of creation in the light\nof evolutionary theory (see Bowler 2009 for an overview).\n\nTed Peters and Martinez Hewlett (2003) have outlined a divine action\nspectrum to clarify the distinct positions about creation and divine\naction in the contemporary science and religion literature that\nfocuses on Christians, agnostics, and atheists. They discern two\ndimensions in this spectrum: the degree of divine action in the\nnatural world, and the form of causal explanations that relate divine\naction to natural processes. At one extreme are creationists. Like\nother theists, they believe God has created the world and its\nfundamental laws, and that God occasionally performs special divine\nactions (miracles) that intervene in the fabric of those laws.\nCreationists deny any role of natural selection in the origin of\nspecies. Within creationism, there are Old and Young Earth\ncreationism, with the former accepting geology and rejecting\nevolutionary biology, and the latter rejecting both. Next to\ncreationism is Intelligent Design, which affirms divine intervention\nin natural processes. Intelligent Design creationists (e.g., Dembski\n1998) believe there is evidence of intelligent design in\norganisms\u2019 irreducible complexity; on the basis of this they\ninfer design and purposiveness (see Kojonen 2016). Like other\ncreationists, they deny a significant role for natural selection in\nshaping organic complexity and they affirm an interventionist account\nof divine action. For political reasons they do not label their\nintelligent designer as God, as they hope to circumvent the\nconstitutional separation of church and state in the US which\nprohibits teaching religious doctrines in public schools (Forrest\n& Gross 2004). Theistic evolutionists hold a non-interventionist\napproach to divine action: God creates indirectly, through the laws of\nnature (e.g., through natural selection). For example, the theologian\nJohn Haught (2000) regards divine providence as self-giving love, and\nnatural selection and other natural processes as manifestations of\nthis love, as they foster creaturely autonomy and independence. While\ntheistic evolutionists allow for special divine action, particularly\nthe miracle of the Incarnation in Christ (e.g., Deane-Drummond 2009),\ndeists such as Michael Corey (1994) think there is only general divine\naction: God has laid out the laws of nature and lets it run like\nclockwork without further interference. Deism is still a long distance\nfrom ontological materialism, the view that the material world is all\nthere is. Ontological materialists tend to hold that the universe is\nintelligible, with laws that scientists can discover, but there is no\nlawgiver and no creator.\n\nViews on divine action were influenced by developments in physics and\ntheir philosophical interpretation. In the seventeenth century,\nnatural philosophers, such as Robert Boyle and John Wilkins, developed\na mechanistic view of the world as governed by orderly and lawlike\nprocesses. Laws, understood as immutable and stable, created\ndifficulties for the concept of special divine action (Pannenberg\n2002). How could God act in a world that was determined by laws?\n\nOne way to regard miracles and other forms of special divine action is\nto see them as actions that somehow suspend or ignore the laws of\nnature. David Hume (1748: 181), for instance, defined a miracle as\n\u201ca transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of\nthe deity, or by the interposal of some invisible agent\u201d, and,\nmore recently, Richard Swinburne (1968: 320) defines a miracle as\n\u201ca violation of a law of Nature by a god\u201d. This concept of\ndivine action is commonly labeled interventionist. Interventionism\nregards the world as causally deterministic, so God has to create room\nfor special divine actions. By contrast, non-interventionist forms of\ndivine action require a world that is, at some level,\nnon-deterministic, so that God can act without having to suspend or\nignore the laws of nature.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, the explanation of the workings of nature\nin terms of elegant physical laws suggested the ingenuity of a divine\ndesigner. The design argument reached its peak during the seventeenth\nand early eighteenth century (McGrath 2011). For example, Samuel\nClarke (1705: part XI, cited in Schliesser 2012: 451) proposed an\na posteriori argument from design by appealing to Newtonian\nscience, calling attention to the \n\n\nexquisite regularity of all the planets\u2019 motions without\nepicycles, stations, retrogradations, or any other deviation or\nconfusion whatsoever. \n\n\nA late proponent of this view of nature as a perfect smooth machine is\nWilliam Paley\u2019s Natural Theology (1802).\n\nAnother conclusion that the new laws-based physics suggested was that\nthe universe was able to run smoothly without requiring an intervening\nGod. The increasingly deterministic understanding of the universe,\nruled by deterministic causal laws as, for example, outlined by\nPierre-Simon Laplace (1749\u20131827), seemed to leave no room for\nspecial divine action, which is a key element of the traditional\nChristian doctrine of creation. Newton resisted interpretations like\nthese in an addendum to the Principia in 1713: the\nplanets\u2019 motions could be explained by laws of gravity, but the\npositions of their orbits, and the positions of the stars\u2014far\nenough apart so as not to influence each other\ngravitationally\u2014required a divine explanation (Schliesser 2012).\nAlston (1989) argued, contra authors such as Polkinghorne (1998), that\nmechanistic, pre-twentieth century physics is compatible with divine\naction and divine free will. Assuming a completely deterministic world\nand divine omniscience, God could set up initial conditions and the\nlaws of nature in such a way as to bring God\u2019s plans about. In\nsuch a mechanistic world, every event is an indirect divine act.\n\nAdvances in twentieth-century physics, including the theories of\ngeneral and special relativity, chaos theory, and quantum theory,\noverturned the mechanical clockwork view of creation. In the latter\nhalf of the twentieth century, chaos theory and quantum physics have\nbeen explored as possible avenues to reinterpret divine action. John\nPolkinghorne (1998) proposed that chaos theory not only presents\nepistemological limits to what we can know about the world, but that\nit also provides the world with an \u201contological openness\u201d\nin which God can operate without violating the laws of nature. One\ndifficulty with this model is that it moves from our knowledge of the\nworld to assumptions about how the world is: does chaos theory mean\nthat outcomes are genuinely undetermined, or that we as limited\nknowers cannot predict them? Robert Russell (2006) proposed that God\nacts in quantum events. This would allow God to directly act in nature\nwithout having to contravene the laws of nature. His is therefore a\nnon-interventionist model: since, under the Copenhagen interpretation\nof quantum mechanics, there are no natural efficient causes at the\nquantum level, God is not reduced to a natural cause. Murphy (1995)\noutlined a similar bottom-up model where God acts in the space\nprovided by quantum indeterminacy. These attempts to locate\nGod\u2019s actions either in chaos theory or quantum mechanics, which\nLydia Jaeger (2012a) has termed \u201cphysicalism-plus-God\u201d,\nhave met with sharp criticism (e.g., Saunders 2002; Jaeger 2012a,b).\nAfter all, it is not even clear whether quantum theory would allow for\nfree human action, let alone divine action, which we do not know much\nabout (Jaeger 2012a). Next to this, William Carroll (2008), building\non Thomistic philosophy, argues that authors such as Polkinghorne and\nMurphy are making a category mistake: God is not a cause in the way\ncreatures are causes, competing with natural causes, and God does not\nneed indeterminacy in order to act in the world. Rather, as primary\ncause God supports and grounds secondary causes. While this\nneo-Thomistic proposal is compatible with determinism (indeed, on this\nview, the precise details of physics do not matter much), it blurs the\ndistinction between general and special divine action. Moreover, the\nIncarnation suggests that the idea of God as a cause among natural\ncauses is not an alien idea in theology, and that God incarnate as\nJesus at least sometimes acts as a natural cause (Sollereder\n2015).\n\nThere has been a debate on the question to what extent randomness is a\ngenuine feature of creation, and how divine action and chance\ninterrelate. Chance and stochasticity are important features of\nevolutionary theory (the non-random retention of random variations).\nIn a famous thought experiment, Gould (1989) imagined that we could\nrewind the tape of life back to the time of the Burgess Shale (508\nmillion years ago); the chance that a rerun of the tape of life would\nend up with anything like the present-day life forms is vanishingly\nsmall. However, Simon Conway Morris (2003) has insisted species very\nsimilar to the ones we know now, including humans, would evolve under\na broad range of conditions.\n\nUnder a theist interpretation, randomness could either be a merely\napparent aspect of creation, or a genuine feature. Plantinga suggests\nthat randomness is a physicalist interpretation of the evidence. God\nmay have guided every mutation along the evolutionary process. In this\nway, God could\n\n\nguide the course of evolutionary history by causing the right\nmutations to arise at the right time and preserving the forms of life\nthat lead to the results he intends. (2011: 121)\n\n\nBy contrast, other authors see stochasticity as a genuine design\nfeature, and not just as a physicalist gloss. Their challenge is to\nexplain how divine providence is compatible with genuine randomness.\n(Under a deistic view, one could simply say that God started the\nuniverse up and did not interfere with how it went, but that option is\nnot open to the theist, and most authors in the field of science and\nreligion are not deists.) The neo-Thomist Elizabeth Johnson (1996)\nargues that divine providence and true randomness are compatible: God\ngives creatures true causal powers, thus making creation more\nexcellent than if they lacked such powers. Random occurrences are also\nsecondary causes. Chance is a form of divine creativity that creates\nnovelty, variety, and freedom. One implication of this view is that\nGod may be a risk taker\u2014although, if God has a providential plan\nfor possible outcomes, there is unpredictability but not risk. Johnson\nuses metaphors of risk taking that, on the whole, leave the creator in\na position of control. Creation, then, is akin to jazz improvisation.\nWhy would God take risks? There are several solutions to this\nquestion. The free will theodicy says that a creation that exhibits\nstochasticity can be truly free and autonomous:\n\n\nAuthentic love requires freedom, not manipulation. Such freedom is\nbest supplied by the open contingency of evolution, and not by strings\nof divine direction attached to every living creature. (Miller 1999\n[2007: 289])\n\n\nThe \u201conly way theodicy\u201d goes a step further, arguing that\na combination of laws and chance is not only the best way, but the\nonly way for God to achieve God\u2019s creative plans (see, e.g.,\nSouthgate 2008 for a defense).\n3.2 Human origins\n\nChristianity, Islam, and Judaism have similar creation stories, which\nultimately go back to the first book of the Hebrew Bible (Genesis).\nAccording to Genesis, humans are the result of a special act of\ncreation. Genesis 1 offers an account of the creation of the world in\nsix days, with the creation of human beings on the sixth day. It\nspecifies that humans were created male and female, and that they were\nmade in God\u2019s image. Genesis 2 provides a different order of\ncreation, where God creates humans earlier in the sequence (before\nother animals), and only initially creates a man, later fashioning a\nwoman out of the man\u2019s rib. Islam has a creation narrative\nsimilar to Genesis 2, with Adam being fashioned out of clay. These\nhandcrafted humans are regarded as the ancestors of all living humans\ntoday. Together with Ussher\u2019s chronology, the received view in\neighteenth-century Europe was that humans were created only about 6000\nyears ago, in an act of special creation.\n\nHumans occupy a privileged position in these creation accounts. In\nChristianity, Judaism, and some strands of Islam, humans are created\nin the image of God (imago Dei). Humans also occupy a special\nplace in creation as a result of the Fall. In Genesis 3, the account\nof the Fall stipulates that the first human couple lived in the Garden\nof Eden in a state of innocence and/or righteousness. This means they\nwere able to not sin, whereas we are no longer able to refrain from\nsinning. By eating from the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Good and\nEvil they fell from this state, and death, manual labor, as well as\npain in childbirth were introduced. Moreover, as a result of this\nso-called \u201coriginal sin\u201d, the effects of Adam\u2019s sin\nare passed on to every human being. The Augustinian interpretation of\noriginal sin also emphasizes that our reasoning capacities have been\nmarred by the distorting effects of sin (the so-called noetic effects\nof sin): as a result of sin, our original perceptual and reasoning\ncapacities have been marred. This interpretation is influential in\ncontemporary analytic philosophy of religion. For example, Plantinga\n(2000) appeals to the noetic effects of sin to explain religious\ndiversity and unbelief, offering this as an explanation for why not\neveryone believes in God even though this belief would be properly\nbasic.\n\nThere are different ways in which Christians have thought about the\nFall and original sin. In Western Christianity, Augustine\u2019s\ndoctrine of original sin is very influential, though there is no\ngenerally accepted Christian doctrine on original sin (Couenhoven\n2005). For Augustine, humans were in a state of original righteousness\nbefore the Fall, and by their action not only marred themselves but\nthe entirety of creation. By contrast, Eastern Orthodox churches are\nmore influenced by Irenaeus, an early Church Father who argued that\nhumans were originally innocent and immature, rather than righteous.\nJohn Hick (1966) was an influential proponent of \u201cIrenaean\nstyle\u201d theodicy in contemporary Christianity. \n\nOver the past decades, authors in the Christian religion and science\nliterature have explored these two interpretations (Irenaean,\nAugustinian) and how they can be made compatible with scientific\nfindings (see De Smedt and De Cruz 2020 for a review). Scientific\nfindings and theories relevant to human origins come from a range of\ndisciplines, in particular geology, paleoanthropology (the study of\nancestral hominins, using fossils and other evidence), archaeology,\nand evolutionary biology. These findings challenge traditional\nreligious accounts of humanity, including the special creation of\nhumans, the imago Dei, the historical Adam and Eve, and\noriginal sin.\n\nIn natural philosophy, the dethroning of humanity from its position as\na specially created species predates Darwin and can already be found\nin early transmutationist publications. For example, Beno\u00eet de\nMaillet\u2019s posthumously published Telliamed (1748, the\ntitle is his name in reverse) traces the origins of humans and other\nterrestrial animals from sea creatures. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed\nchimpanzees as the ancestors to humans in his Philosophie\nZoologique (1809). The Scottish publisher and geologist Robert\nChambers\u2019 anonymously published Vestiges of Creation\n(1844) stirred controversy with its detailed naturalistic account of\nthe origin of species. He proposed that the first organisms arose\nthrough spontaneous generation, and that all subsequent organisms\nevolved from them. Moreover, he argued that humans have a single\nevolutionary origin: \n\n\nThe probability may now be assumed that the human race sprung from one\nstock, which was at first in a state of simplicity, if not barbarism\n(1844: 305) \n\n\na view starkly different from the Augustinian interpretation of\nhumanity as being in a prelapsarian state of perfection.\n\nDarwin was initially reluctant to publish on human origins. While he\ndid not discuss human evolution in his Origin of Species, he\npromised, \u201cLight will be thrown on the origin of man and his\nhistory\u201d (1859: 487). Huxley (1863) wrote Man\u2019s Place\nin Nature, the first book on human evolution from a Darwinian\npoint of view which discussed fossil evidence, such as the then\nrecently uncovered Neanderthal fossils from Gibraltar. Darwin\u2019s\n(1871) Descent of Man identified Africa as the likely place\nwhere humans originated, and used comparative anatomy to demonstrate\nthat chimpanzees and gorillas were closely related to humans. In the\ntwentieth century, paleoanthropologists debated whether humans\nseparated from the other great apes (at the time wrongly classified\ninto the paraphyletic group Pongidae) about 15 million years\nago, or about 5 million years ago. Molecular clocks\u2014first immune\nresponses (e.g., Sarich & Wilson 1967), then direct genetic\nevidence (e.g., Rieux et al. 2014)\u2014favor the shorter\nchronology.\n\nThe discovery of many hominin fossils, including Ardipithecus\nramidus (4.4 million years ago), Australopithecus\nafarensis (nicknamed \u201cLucy\u201d), about 3.5 million years\nold, the Sima de los Huesos hominins (about 400,000 years old,\nancestors to the Neanderthals), Homo neanderthalensis, and\nthe intriguing Homo floresiensis (small hominins who lived on\nthe island of Flores, Indonesia, dated to 700,000\u201350,000 years\nago) have created a rich, complex picture of hominin evolution. These\nfinds are supplemented by detailed analyses of ancient DNA extracted\nfrom fossil remains, bringing to light a previously unknown species of\nhominin (the Denisovans) who lived in Siberia up to about 40,000 years\nago. Taken together, this evidence indicates that humans did not\nevolve in a simple linear fashion, but that human evolution resembles\nan intricate branching tree with many dead ends, in line with the\nevolution of other species. Genetic and fossil evidence favors a\npredominantly African origin of our species Homo sapiens (as\nearly as 315,000 years ago) with limited gene-flow from other hominin\nspecies such as Neanderthals and Denisovans (see, e.g., Richter et al.\n2017).\n\nIn the light of these scientific findings, contemporary science and\nreligion authors have reconsidered the questions of human uniqueness,\nimago Dei, the Incarnation, and the historicity of original\nsin. Some authors have attempted to reinterpret human uniqueness as a\nnumber of species-specific cognitive and behavioral adaptations. For\nexample, van Huyssteen (2006) considers the ability of humans to\nengage in cultural and symbolic behavior, which became prevalent in\nthe Upper Paleolithic, as a key feature of uniquely human behavior.\nOther theologians have opted to broaden the notion of imago\nDei. Given what we know about the capacities for morality and\nreason in non-human animals, Celia Deane-Drummond (2012) and Oliver\nPutz (2009) reject an ontological distinction between humans and\nnon-human animals, and argue for a reconceptualization of the\nimago Dei to include at least some nonhuman animals. Joshua\nMoritz (2011) raises the question of whether extinct hominin species,\nsuch as Homo neanderthalensis and Homo floresiensis,\nwhich co-existed with Homo sapiens for some part of\nprehistory, partook in the divine image.\n\nThere is also discussion of how we can understand the Incarnation (the\nbelief that Jesus, the second person of the Trinity, became a human being)\nwith the evidence we have of human evolution. Some interpret\nChrist\u2019s divine nature quite liberally. For instance, Peacocke\n(1979) regarded Jesus as the point where humanity is perfect for the\nfirst time. Christ is the progression and culmination of what\nevolution has been working toward in the teleological, progressivist\ninterpretation of evolution by Teilhard de Chardin (1971). According\nto Teilhard, evil is still horrible but no longer incomprehensible; it\nbecomes a natural feature of creation\u2014since God chose evolution\nas his mode of creation, evil arises as an inevitable byproduct.\nDeane-Drummond (2009), however, points out that this interpretation is\nproblematic: Teilhard worked within a Spencerian progressivist model\nof evolution, and he was anthropocentric, seeing humanity as the\nculmination of evolution. Contemporary evolutionary theory has\nrepudiated the Spencerian progressivist view, and adheres to a\nstricter Darwinian model. Deane-Drummond, who regards human morality\nas lying on a continuum with the social behavior of other animals,\nconceptualizes the Fall as a mythical, rather than a historical event.\nIt represents humanity\u2019s sharper awareness of moral concerns and\nits ability to make wrong choices. She regards Christ as incarnate\nwisdom, situated in a theodrama that plays against the backdrop of an\nevolving creation. Like all human beings, Christ is connected to the\nrest of creation through common descent. By saving us, he saves the\nwhole of creation.\n\nDebates on the Fall and the historical Adam have centered on how these\nnarratives can be understood in the light of contemporary science. On\nthe face of it, limitations of our cognitive capacities can be\nnaturalistically explained as a result of biological constraints, so\nthere seems little explanatory gain to appeal to the narrative of the\nFall. Some have attempted to interpret the concepts of sin and Fall in\nways that are compatible with paleoanthropology, notably Peter van\nInwagen (2004) and Jamie K. Smith (2017), who have argued that God\ncould have providentially guided hominin evolution until there was a\ntightly-knit community of primates, endowed with reason, language, and\nfree will, and this community was in close union with God. At some\npoint in history, these hominins somehow abused their free will to\ndistance themselves from God. These narratives follow the Augustinian\ntradition. Others, such as John Schneider (2014, 2020), on the other\nhand, argue that there is no genetic or paleoanthropological evidence\nfor such a community of superhuman beings.\n\nThis survey has given a sense of the richness of the literature of\nscience and religion. Giving an exhaustive overview would go beyond\nthe scope of an encyclopedia entry. Because science and religion are\nsuch broad terms, the literature has split up in diverse fields of\n\u201cscience engaged theology\u201d, where a specific claim or\nsubfield in science is studied in relation to a specific claim in\ntheology (Perry & Ritchie 2018). For example, rather than ask if\nChristianity is compatible with science, one could ask whether\nChristian eschatology is compatible with scientific claims about\ncultural evolution, or the cosmic fate of the universe. As the scope\nof science and religion becomes less parochial and more global in its\noutlook, the different topics the field can engage with become very\ndiverse.\n",
