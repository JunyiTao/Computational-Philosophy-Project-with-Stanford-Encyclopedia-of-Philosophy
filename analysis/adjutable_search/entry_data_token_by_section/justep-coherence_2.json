Traditional Accounts of Coherence\n\nBy a traditional account of coherence we will mean one which construes\ncoherence as a relation of mutual support or agreement among given\ndata (propositions, beliefs, memories, testimonies etc.). Early\ncharacterizations were given by, among others, Brand Blanshard (1939)\nand A. C. Ewing (1934). According to Ewing, a coherent set is\ncharacterized partly by consistency and partly by the property that\nevery belief in the set follows logically from the others taken\ntogether. Thus, a set such as \\(\\{A_1,\nA_2, A_1 \\amp A_2\\}\\),\nif consistent, is highly coherent on this view because each element\nfollows by logical deduction from the rest in concert.\n\nWhile Ewing\u2019s definition is admirably precise, it defines coherence\ntoo narrowly. Few belief sets that occur naturally in everyday life\nsatisfy the austere second part of his definition: the requirement\nthat each element follow logically from the rest when combined.\nConsider, for instance, the set consisting of propositions \\(A,\nB\\) and \\(C\\), where\n\n\\(A =\\)\u201cJohn was at the crime scene at the time of the\nrobbery\u201d\n\\(B =\\)\u201cJohn owns a gun of the type used by the\nrobber\u201d\n\\(C =\\)\u201cJohn deposited a large sum of\nmoney in his bank account the next day\u201d\n\n\nThis set is intuitively coherent, and yet it fails to satisfy Ewing\u2019s\nsecond condition. The proposition \\(A\\), for instance, does not\nfollow logically from \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) taken together: that John\nowns a gun of the relevant type and deposited money in his bank the\nday after does not logically imply him being at the crime scene at the\ntime of the crime. Similarly, neither \\(B\\) nor \\(C\\) follows\nfrom the rests of the propositions in the set by logic alone.\n\nC. I. Lewis\u2019s definition of coherence, or \u201ccongruence\u201d to\nuse his term, can be seen as a refinement and improvement of Ewing\u2019s\nbasic idea. As Lewis defines the term, a set of \u201csupposed facts\nasserted\u201d is coherent (congruent) just in case every element in\nthe set is supported by all the other elements taken together, whereby\n\u201csupport\u201d is understood not in logical terms but in a\nprobabilistic sense. In other words, \\(P\\) supports \\(Q\\) if and\nonly if the probability of \\(Q\\) is raised on the assumption that\n\\(P\\) is true. As is readily appreciated, Lewis\u2019s definition is\nless restrictive than Ewing\u2019s: more sets will turn out to be coherent\non the former than on the latter. (There are some uninteresting\nlimiting cases for which this is not true. For instance, a set of\ntautologies will be coherent in Ewing\u2019s but not in Lewis\u2019s sense.\nThere cases are not interesting because they are not significant parts\nof anyone\u2019s actual body of beliefs.)\n\nLet us return to the example with John. The proposition \\(A\\),\nwhile not logically entailed by \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), is under normal\ncircumstances nevertheless supported by those propositions taken\ntogether. If we assume that John owns the relevant type of gun and\ndeposited a large sum the next day, then this should raise the\nprobability that John did it and thereby also raise the probability\nthat he was at the crime scene when the robbery took place. Similarly,\none could hold that each of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) is supported, in the\nprobabilistic sense, by the other elements of the set. If so, this set\nis not only coherent in an intuitive sense but also coherent according\nto Lewis\u2019s definition. Against Lewis\u2019s proposal one could hold that it\nseems arbitrary to focus merely on the support single elements of a\nset receive from the rest of the set (cf. Bovens and Olsson 2000). Why\nnot consider the support any subset, not just singletons, receives\nfrom the rest?\n\nAnother influential proposal concerning how to define coherence\noriginates from Laurence BonJour (1985), whose account is considerably\nmore complex than earlier suggestions. Where Ewing and Lewis proposed\nto define coherence in terms of one single concept\u2014logical\nconsequence and probability, respectively\u2014BonJour thinks that\ncoherence is a concept with a multitude of different aspects\ncorresponding to the following \u201ccoherence criteria\u201d\n(97\u201399):\n\nA system of beliefs is coherent only if it is logically\nconsistent.\nA system of beliefs is coherent in proportion to its degree of\nprobabilistic consistency.\nThe coherence of a system of beliefs is increased by the presence\nof inferential connections between its component beliefs and increased\nin proportion to the number and strength of such connections.\nThe coherence of a system of beliefs is diminished to the extent\nto which it is divided into subsystems of beliefs which are relatively\nunconnected to each other by inferential connections.\nThe coherence of a system of beliefs is decreased in proportion to\nthe presence of unexplained anomalies in the believed content of the\nsystem.\n\n\nA difficulty pertaining to theories of coherence that construe\ncoherence as a multidimensional concept is to specify how the\ndifferent dimensions are to be amalgamated so as to produce an overall\ncoherence judgment. It could well happen that one system \\(S\\) is\nmore coherent than another system \\(T\\) in one respect, whereas\n\\(T\\) is more coherent than \\(S\\) in another. Perhaps \\(S\\)\ncontains more inferential connections than \\(T\\), but \\(T\\) is\nless anomalous than \\(S\\). If so, which system is more coherent in\nan overall sense? Bonjour\u2019s theory is largely silent on this\npoint.\n\nBonJour\u2019s account also raises another general issue. The third\ncriterion stipulates that the degree of coherence increases with the\nnumber of inferential connections between different parts of the\nsystem. Now as a system grows larger the probability that there will\nbe relatively many inferentially connected beliefs is increased simply\nbecause there are more possible connections to be made. Hence, one\ncould expect there to be a positive correlation between the size of a\nsystem and the number of inferential connection between the beliefs\ncontained in the system. BonJour\u2019s third criterion, taken at face\nvalue, entails therefore that a bigger system will generally have a\nhigher degree of coherence due to its sheer size. But this is at least\nnot obviously correct. A possible modified coherence criterion could\nstate that what is correlated with higher coherence is not the number\nof inferential connections but rather the inferential density\nof the system, where the latter is obtained by dividing the number of\ninferential connections by the number of beliefs in the system.\n",
