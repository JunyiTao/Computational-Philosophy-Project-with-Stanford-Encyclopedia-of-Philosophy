    "main_text": "Types of Ambiguity || Syntactic Ambiguity\n3.2 Syntactic Ambiguity\n\nSyntactic ambiguity occurs when there are many LFs that correspond to\nthe same sentence \u2013 assuming we don\u2019t think of sentences as\ndistinct if their LFs are distinct. This may be the result of scope,\nmovement or binding, and the level at which the ambiguity is localized\ncan involve full sentences or phrases. Here are some examples of\npurportedly syntactic ambiguities.\n3.2.1 Phrasal\n\nA phrase can be ambiguous by corresponding to distinct syntactic\nstructures. The classic example:\n\nsuperfluous hair remover\n\n\ncan mean the same as \u2018hair remover that is superfluous\u2019 or\n\u2018remover of hair that is superfluous\u2019. The ambiguity\nresults from the lack of representation of constituent structure in the English\nsentence, since it is unclear if the noun \u2018hair remover\u2019\nis modified by \u2018superfluous\u2019 in its specifier or if the\n \u2018superfluous hair\u2019 is the specifier of the noun\n\u2018remover\u2019. In current syntax, the phrase would be\nassociated with two different NPs.\n\nSimilarly, a phrase can be ambiguous between an adjunct and an\nargument:\n\nJohn floated the boat between the rocks.\n\n\n\u2018between the rocks\u2019 can modify the event of floating,\nsaying where it happened and thus acts as an adjunct. It can also act\nas an argument of \u2018float\u2019, specifying where the resulting\nlocation of the boat on account of the floating. It can also act as an\nadjunct modifying \u2018the boat\u2019, helping to specify which\nboat it is. All of these are readings of (1) and in each case we find\n\u2018between the rocks\u2019 playing very different roles. Assuming\nthese roles are dictated by their relations in the relevant LF, we get three very\ndifferent LFs that correspond to (1).\n\nThematic assignments can be similarly ambiguous at the level of LF\nwith deleted phrases:\n\nThe chicken is ready to eat.\n\n\n(2) can mean that the chicken is ready to be fed or to be fed to\nsomeone depending on the thematic assignment. In a popular semantic\nframework, this is because \u2018the chicken\u2019 is assigned agent\non one reading and patient on another. Arguably, these assignments is\ncorresponds syntactic phenomenon assuming principles that align\nthematic role and syntactic position (see Baker 1988, 1997; Williams\n1994; and Grimshaw 1990) but the semantic point stands either way.\nThey result in a clear ambiguity that we may term \u2018thematic\nambiguity\u2019 for present purposes.\n\nMultiple connectives present similar ambiguities. The following\nambiguity, for example, is borne directly out of failure to tell which\nconnective has widest scope:\n\nHe got drunk and fired or divorced.\n\n\nWe teach our students in propositional logic to disambiguate these\nwith brackets but we are not so lucky when it comes to the\northographic and phonetic groupings in natural language.\n\nAn interesting case is the semantics of modals. At least some modal\nauxiliaries and adverbs seem to allow for distinct senses such as\nmetaphysical, deontic, doxastic and perhaps practical. Consider\n\nJohn ought to be at home by now.\n\n\n(4) can mean that John\u2019s presence at home is, given everything\nwe know, guaranteed. It might mean that, though we have no idea where\nhe is, he is under the obligation to be at home. Similarly:\n\nThe coin might come up heads.\n\n\n(5) means that there is an open metaphysical possibility in which the\ncoin comes up heads. It also means that everything we know\ndoesn\u2019t tell us that the coin won\u2019t come up heads. On the\nlatter reading, for example, we can utter (5) truly even if we know\nthat the coin is weighted, but we aren\u2019t sure in which way.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nYou must eat a piece of cake.\n\n\n(6) can express a moral imperative: you are obliged morally to eat a\npiece of cake. It can express a practical obligation: given your\ntastes you\u2019d be remiss if you didn\u2019t eat a piece. Though\nthis would rarely make sense, (6) can suggest a doxastic certainty:\neverything we know entails that you won\u2019t fail to eat the\ncake.\n\nThe multiplicity of interpretation in these modals is pretty clear.\nOne particularly controversial case involves imperative vs epistemic\ninterpretations of \u2018must\u2019 as in \u2018He must be\nhere\u2019. However, whether or not it is a lexical or structural\nambiguity (or best treated as a case of univocality with indexicality)\nis a source of some controversy (see Drubig 2001). In the semantics\nliterature, views on which modalities are treated indexically rather\nthan as cases of ambiguity pretty much dominate all contemporary\nthinking, as we shall see in section 6.3.\n3.2.1 Quantifier and Operator Scope\n\nFinally, and of much interest to philosophers and logicians, there are\nscopal ambiguities involving operators and quantifiers. For example:\n\nEvery woman squeezed a man.\n\n\n(7) can express\n\n[\u2200x:Wx][\u2203y:My](x\nsqueezed y)\n\n\n(In regimented English: For every womani there is at least\none man that shei squeezed.)\n\nOr\n\n[\u2203y:My][\u2200x:Wx](x\nsqueezed y)\n\n\n(In regimented English: There is at least one mani who is\nsuch that every womanj squeezed himi.)\n\nThese ambiguities can be very difficult to hear in some cases. For\nexample:\n\nSomeone is in a car accident every 10 seconds.\n\n\nNo one is tempted to hear the reading of (10) that involves an unlucky\ndriver who is constantly in car accidents. Thus, our best theory may\ndetermine an ambiguity that is never the intended meaning of an \nutterance of the ambiguous sentence. If we were able to revive people\nfrequently and very quickly and immediately get them into cars , we would presumably start to consider the currently\npragmatically unavailable reading of (10) more seriously.\n\nOperators have scopal interactions with quantifiers as well. The\nsemantics of modal auxiliaries, adverbs, temporal modifiers and tense\nare the subject of much concern but one thing is clear: they have\ninteractive effects.\n\nModal and temporal fallacies abound if we aren\u2019t careful about\nscope:\n\n(P1)\nJohn is a bachelor.\n(P2)\nAll bachelors are necessarily unmarried.\n(C)\nTherefore John is necessarily unmarried.\n\n\nIf we allow \u2018necessarily\u2019 to have \u2018bachelors\u2019\netc. within its scope, P2 is true but the conclusion is not entailed.\nIf the modal is interpreted narrowly, the conclusion follows but P2 is\nfalse and so is the conclusion.\n\nThere is a great deal of controversy over how scope is to be handled.\nOrthodoxy suggests movement of quantifiers at LF where quantifier\nscope is made explicit and unambiguous. May (1985) is often cited as\nthe canonical source for this \u2013 but it is worth noting that in\nthat work May treats some LFs as underdetermining some semantic scopal\nrelations. The situation is less clear with temporal and modal (and\nother) operators: many semantic theories treat tense and temporal\nadverbs as quantifiers, while some treat modal expression in this\nmanner. Other treat them as the operators or adverbs they appear to\nbe. One respectable semantic tradition sees (P2) as ambiguous, for\nexample, between:\n\n[\u2200w][\u2200x:Bachelor(w,x)](Unmarried(x,w))\n\n\n(In regimented English: Every world is such that every bachelor at\nthat world is unmarried at that world.)\n\nAnd\n\n[\u2200x:Bachelor(w,x)][\u2200w\u2032](Unmarried\n(x,w\u2032))\n\n\n(In regimented English: Every bachelor at a world is such that at\nevery world he is a bachelor.)\n\nOn the first reading, the world-quantifier takes wide scope. On the\nsecond, the bachelor-quantifier takes wide scope and the world\nvariable is unbound. On the operator treatment, we dispose of\nquantification over worlds and let the predicates be interpreted\nrelative to the operators, perhaps as a matter of movement, perhaps by\nother semantic means.\n\nNegation has similarly been argued to present interesting scope\nambiguities (see Russell (1905) for an early example of a\nphilosophical use of this type of ambiguity). The following, according\nto Russell, is ambiguous:\n\nThe present king of France is not bald.\n\n\nAs is:\n\nAll that glitters is not gold.\n\n\nRussell claims that (13) and (14) are ambiguous between a reading on which negation that scopes over\nthe sentence as a whole and one reading on which it scopes under the determiner\nphrase and over the predicate (though see Strawson (1950) See also Neale (1990)).\n\nLong story short, of great interest to philosophers are these sorts of\nscope worries as many an argument has been accused of looking\nconvincing because of a scope ambiguity (the causal argument for\nGod\u2019s existence, the ontological argument). The development of\nlogics capable of handling multiple quantification was an achievement\nin part because they could sort out just this sort of linguistic\nphenomenon.\n\nOne final note: even in the domain of scopal ambiguities, there are\ncontroversies about whether to treat (some of) these apparent ambiguities as\nambiguities. Pietroski and Hornstein (2002) argue that many of these\ncases aren\u2019t ambiguities at all and prefer a pragmatic\nexplanation of the multiple readings. \n3.2.2 Pronouns\n\nBound and unbound readings of pronouns give rise to similar problems,\nthough whether this is a semantic, syntactic or pragmatic ambiguity\nhas been the source of heated debate. If I tell you \u2018everyone\nloves his mother\u2019, the sentence may be interpreted with\n\u2018his\u2019 being co-indexed with \u2018everyone\u2019 and\nyielding different mothers (potentially) for different values of\n\u2018everyone\u2019 or it could be interpreted deictically saying\nthat everyone loves that [appropriate demonstration] guy\u2019s\nmother. Static semantics usually treats the distinction between bound\nand free pronouns as a fundamental ambiguity; dynamic semantics\nrelegates the distinction to an ambiguity in variable choice (see Heim\n1982, 1983, and Kamp 1981).\n\nThe phenomenon is subject to syntactic constraints. We have a good\nidea of the conditions under which we can fail to get bound readings,\nas characterized by binding theory. Thus, we know that binding is\nimpossible in cross-over cases and cases where pronouns are \u2018too\nclose\u2019 to their binder ((15) is a case of \u2018weak\ncrossover\u2019, (16) is a case of \u2018strong crossover\u2019 and\n(17) is a violation of principle B of binding theory):\n\n?His1 mother loves John1.\n*He1 loves John1.\n*John1 loves him1.\n\n\nHowever, the impossibility of these readings demonstrates constraints\non interpretation. It doesn\u2019t resolve the ambiguity in\nsentences where violations of binding theory do not occur. \n",
