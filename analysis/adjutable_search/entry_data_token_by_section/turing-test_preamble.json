    "main_text": "\n\nThe phrase \u201cThe Turing Test\u201d is most properly used to\nrefer to a proposal made by Turing (1950) as a way of dealing with the\nquestion whether machines can think. According to Turing, the question\nwhether machines can think is itself \u201ctoo meaningless\u201d to\ndeserve discussion (442). However, if we consider the more\nprecise\u2014and somehow related\u2014question whether a digital\ncomputer can do well in a certain kind of game that Turing describes\n(\u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d), then\u2014at least in\nTuring\u2019s eyes\u2014we do have a question that admits of precise\ndiscussion. Moreover, as we shall see, Turing himself thought that it\nwould not be too long before we did have digital computers that could\n\u201cdo well\u201d in the Imitation Game.\n\nThe phrase \u201cThe Turing Test\u201d is sometimes used more\ngenerally to refer to some kinds of behavioural tests for the presence\nof mind, or thought, or intelligence in putatively minded entities.\nSo, for example, it is sometimes suggested that The Turing Test is\nprefigured in Descartes\u2019 Discourse on the Method.\n(Copeland (2000:527) finds an anticipation of the test in the 1668\nwritings of the Cartesian de Cordemoy. Abramson (2011a) presents\narchival evidence that Turing was aware of Descartes\u2019 language\ntest at the time that he wrote his 1950 paper. Gunderson (1964)\nprovides an early instance of those who find that Turing\u2019s work\nis foreshadowed in the work of Descartes.)\n\nThe phrase \u201cThe Turing Test\u201d is also sometimes used to\nrefer to certain kinds of purely behavioural allegedly logically\nsufficient conditions for the presence of mind, or thought, or\nintelligence, in putatively minded entities. So, for example, Ned\nBlock\u2019s \u201cBlockhead\u201d thought experiment is often said\nto be a (putative) knockdown objection to The Turing Test. (Block\n(1981) contains a direct discussion of The Turing Test in this\ncontext.) Here, what a proponent of this view has in mind is the idea\nthat it is logically possible for an entity to pass the kinds\nof tests that Descartes and (at least allegedly) Turing have in\nmind\u2014to use words (and, perhaps, to act) in just the kind of way\nthat human beings do\u2014and yet to be entirely lacking in\nintelligence, not possessed of a mind, etc.\n\nThe subsequent discussion takes up the preceding ideas in the order in\nwhich they have been introduced. First, there is a discussion of\nTuring\u2019s paper (1950), and of the arguments contained therein.\nSecond, there is a discussion of current assessments of various\nproposals that have been called \u201cThe Turing Test\u201d (whether\nor not there is much merit in the application of this label to the\nproposals in question). Third, there is a brief discussion of some\nrecent writings on The Turing Test, including some discussion of the\nquestion whether The Turing Test sets an appropriate goal for research\ninto artificial intelligence. Finally, there is a very short\ndiscussion of Searle\u2019s Chinese Room argument, and, in\nparticular, of the bearing of this argument on The Turing Test.\n\nFor other introductory discussions of the Turing Test, from a range of\nperspectives, see, for example: Copeland (2000), Damassino and Novelli\n(2020), French (2000), Korukonda (2003), Moor (2008), Neufeld and\nFinnestad (2020a) (2020b), Proudfoot and Copeland (2008), Saygin et\nal. (2000), and Shieber (2004). For further information about Turing\nhimself, see, for example: Cooper and van Leeuwen (2013), Copeland et\nal. (2017), Hodges (1983), Millican and Clark (1999) and Turing\n(1992).\n",
