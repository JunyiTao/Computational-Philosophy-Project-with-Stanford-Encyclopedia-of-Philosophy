    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Liberalism || Limits on Liberty\n3.5 Limits on Liberty\n\nDespite this robust rationale for liberties of thought and action, it\nis also important to see that Mill is not treating liberty as an\nintrinsic good or endorsing an unqualified right to liberty.\n\nFirst, we should note that Mill does not defend liberty per\nse, but only certain basic liberties. His defense\nfocuses on three basic categories of liberty (I 12).\n\nLiberties of conscience and expression\nLiberties of tastes, pursuits, and life-plans\nLiberties of association\n\n\nThough these liberties evidently include quite a bit, there is no\nsuggestion here that any and all liberty deserves protection. Why not?\nInsofar as Mill defends individual liberties by appeal to deliberative\nvalues, he can distinguish the importance of different liberties in\nterms of their role in practical deliberation. A central part of\npractical deliberation is forming ideals and regulating one\u2019s\nactions and plans in accordance with these ideals. But some liberties\nseem more central than others to the selection of personal ideals. For\ninstance, it seems plausible that liberties of speech, association,\nworship, and choice of profession are more important than liberties to\ndrive in either direction on streets designated as one-way, liberties\nnot to wear seat belts, or liberties to dispose of one\u2019s gross\nincome as one pleases, because restrictions on the former seem to\ninterfere more than restrictions on the latter with deliberations and\nchoices about what sort of person to be.\n\nSecond, even the exercise of basic liberties is limited by the harm\nprinciple, which justifies restricting liberty to prevent harm to\nothers. Even expressive liberties can be restricted when their\nexercise poses a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d to others.\n\n\n[E]ven opinions lose their immunity when the circumstances in which\nthey are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a\npositive instigation to some mischievous act. An opinion that corn\ndealers are starvers of the poor, or that private property is robbery,\nought to be unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but\nmay justifiably incur punishment when delivered orally to an excited\nmob assembled before the house of a corn dealer, or when handed about\namong the same mob in the form of a placard. (III 1)\n\n\nThere are interesting questions about the correct interpretation of\nthe harm principle, which we will examine later. But Mill\u2019s\ncommitment to some version of the harm principle as a ground for\nrestricting liberty is hard to dispute.\n\nThird, it is important to be clear about how Mill values basic\nliberties. To account for the robust character of his perfectionist\nargument, it is tempting to suppose that Mill thinks these basic\nliberties are themselves important intrinsic goods (see Berger 1984:\n41, 50, 199, 231\u201332; Bogen and Farrell 1978: 325\u201328). But\nin Mill\u2019s introductory remarks he insists that his liberal\nprinciples do not apply to individuals who do not have a suitably\ndeveloped normative competence (I 10). So, for instance, the\nprohibition on paternalism does not extend to children with immature\ndeliberative faculties or to adults with very limited normative\ncompetence, whether due to congenital defects or social circumstance.\nSuch restrictions on the scope of Mill\u2019s principles make little\nsense if basic liberties are dominant intrinsic goods, for then it\nshould always be valuable to accord people liberties\u2014a claim\nthat Mill denies. Instead, Mill claims that these liberties have value\nonly when various necessary conditions for the exercise of\ndeliberative capacities\u2014in particular, sufficient rational\ndevelopment or normative competence\u2014are in place.\n",
