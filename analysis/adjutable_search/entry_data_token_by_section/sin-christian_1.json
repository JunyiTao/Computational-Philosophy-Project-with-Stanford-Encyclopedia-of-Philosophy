    "main_text": "Approaching Sin within a Religious Tradition || Sin in Relation to Other Christian Doctrines\n1.2 Sin in Relation to Other Christian Doctrines\n\nWithin the Christian tradition, sin is typically seen as a privation,\nin line with the general privation view of evil (Mann 2001, Stump\n2003, and Couenhoven 2013). Otherwise, sin and evil become reified. If\nsin were a positively existing entity in its own right, then insofar\nas God is the creator and sustainer of all things, God would be\nresponsible for creating and sustaining sin. Yet as Copan notes, such\na position cuts directly against the fundamental goodness of\nGod\u2019s creating act:\n\n\nWe do a disservice to the Christian doctrine of anthropology by\nemphasizing human wickedness to such a degree that we obscure the\ngoodness of God\u2019s creation\u2026. While Christian philosophers\nought not ignore the painfully obvious fact of human depravity, they\nmust set this against the backdrop of the goodness of God\u2019s\ncreation. (Copan 2003: 522; see also Hasker 2008: 75; and Sweeney\n2018, 366)\n\n\nThis example demonstrates how Christian doctrines of sin can\u2019t\nbe fully understood in isolation from other related theological\ndoctrines (see Timpe forthcoming, for methodological criticisms of\nChristian analytic theology). Rather, conceptions of sin should be\nunderstood in the context of human life and creation as a whole,\n\n\nin relation to God\u2019s original intentions for humanity at\ncreation and the effects of God\u2019s mercy, cleansing and\nforgiveness. (Johnson & Lauber 2016b: xi)\n\n\nA full exploration of the theological doctrine of sin, or\nhamartiology, in the Christian tradition would thus require\nextended engagement not only with particular biblical texts, but also\nwith other core Christian doctrines to which the doctrine of sin is\nclosely linked, such as creation, Christology, anthropology,\natonement, the sacraments, redemption, and eschatology (Bauerschmidt\n2016: 199).\n\nThe New Testament, like the Hebrew Scriptures, uses a wide range of\nterms for sin (the literature here is immense; See McCall 2019:\nchapter 1; Green 2017; and the essays in Johnson & Lauber 2016a),\nas well as employing a number of metaphors drawn from the earlier\nJewish tradition. Most prominent among those metaphors is the idea of\nsin as a stain, a burden, or a debt. These metaphors help establish\nthe contours in which a Christian hamartiology must be worked out, but\nnone of them fully encapsulates the Scriptures\u2019 teaching on sin\n(Bashevkin 2019: 6). As these metaphors differ, what appears to be the\nproper response to sin also differs. Stains need to be cleansed.\nBurdens need to be lifted. Debts need to be paid or otherwise\ndischarged. (See Anderson\u2019s Sin: A History for a\ndescription of the different uses of these metaphors and how the\ndominant metaphor shifts over the course of various Biblical texts.)\nMetaphors used to describe sin thus have a large impact on its\nphilosophical treatment in the Christian tradition.\n",
