    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of the Phaedo\n2. The Metaphysics of the Phaedo\n\n\nThe Phaedo is Plato's eulogy to Socrates. It recounts the\nlast hours of Plato's teacher. Socrates/Plato wants to convince us that\nwe should care about our souls and that the best way to care for the\nsoul is to live philosophically. Towards that end we find a series of\narguments whose aim is to prove the immortality of the soul. At least\nthree of these arguments, the Argument from Recollection and its\nprelude (65a-67a and 72e-78b), the Affinity Argument (78b-84b), and the\nFinal Argument (102a-107a) and its prelude (95a-102a), are crucial for\nunderstanding Plato's initial thoughts on metaphysics and epistemology.\nHere Plato draws a contrast between unchanging Forms and changing\nmaterial particulars. Unfortunately, neither in the Phaedo nor\nin any other dialogue do we find Plato giving a detailed description of\nthe nature of Forms, or particulars, or their interaction. What is\nreferred to as Plato's theory of Forms is thus a rational\nreconstruction of Plato's doctrine. In such a reconstruction scholars\ntry to determine a set of principles or theses which, taken together,\nallow us to show why Plato says what he does about Forms, souls, and\nother metaphysical items. In the attempt to make more precise what\nPlato is after, one risks attributing to Plato notions that are either\nnot his or not as well developed in Plato as scholars would hope.\nPerhaps the notion of a particular is such a case. Intuitively,\nparticulars are things like my dog Ajax, Venus, my computer, and so on,\nthe ordinary material things of the everyday spatio-temporal world.\n(But we also speak of particular actions, particular events, particular\nsouls, and much else.) In a rational reconstruction, we can be\nmore precise by stipulating, for instance, that a particular is that of\nwhich properties are predicated and which is never predicated of\nanything (or anything other than itself). This \u2018stipulated\ndefinition\u2019 is nowhere in Plato, though it may well capture his\nthinking about ordinary particulars. For the sake of exposition, I will\nassume that in the Phaedo Plato is appealing to our\nna\u00efve, intuitive understanding of what it is for something to be a\nmaterial particular. In the author's opinion, the metaphysics of the\nPhaedo and other middle period works is devoted to developing\nthe account of Forms; perhaps because while most of us think that\nincluded in what there is are the various, e.g., dogs, people,\nmountains and trees, few of us ever think about whether there is some\nuniversal/Form, Justice Itself, The Large Itself, and so on, that\nexists outside of space and time. (In the late dialogues, especially\nthe Timaeus and Philebus, Plato attempts to give a\nsystematic account of material particulars.)\n\n\nThe argument of the Phaedo begins from Plato's assertion\nthat the soul seeks freedom from the body so that it may best grasp\ntruth, because the body hinders and distracts it: the soul comes to be\nseparate (choris) from the body, itself by itself ((aute\nkath auten) (64c5\u20138)). The senses furnish no truth; those senses\nabout the body are neither accurate nor clear. The soul reckons best\nwhen it is itself by itself, i.e., not in contact with body (65a-65d3).\nAt this juncture, Socrates changes course:\nWhat about these things? Do we say that justice itself is\nsomething? Of course. And the fair and the good? Surely. Then have you\never seen any of these sorts of things with your eyes? In no way. But\nthen have you grasped them with any other sense through the body. I am\ntalking about all (of them), for instance about size, health, strength,\nin a word about the essence (ousia) of all of them, what each\nhappens to be. Is it through the body then that what is most true of\nthese things is contemplated? Or does it hold thus? Whoever of us\nshould prepare himself to consider most accurately each thing itself\nabout which he inquires, that one would come closest to knowing each\nthing. \u2026 he would do this most cleanly \u2026who using his\nintellect itself by itself, unmixed would undertake to hunt down each\nof the beings, itself by itself unmixed (65d4\u201366a3).\n\n\nThis is the first passage in the dialogues widely agreed to\nintroduce Forms. First, Forms are marked as auto kath auto\nbeings, beings that are what they are in virtue of themselves.\nIn subsequent arguments we learn other features of these Forms. From\nthe next argument concerning Recollection (see \u00a711), Forms are said to\nbe perfect and what particulars strive to be like but fall short of.\nThen in the Affinity Argument we discover that Forms are simple or\nincomposite, of one form (monoeidetic), whereas particulars are\ncomplex, divisible and of many forms. In the crucial Final Argument,\nPlato finally presents the hypothesis of Forms to explain coming into\nbeing and destruction, in general, i.e., change. Once Cebes accepts the\nhypothesis, a novel implication is announced (100c3\u20137):\nWell then, consider what then follows if you also accept my\nhypothesis. For it seems to me that if anything else is beautiful\nbesides Beauty Itself, it is beautiful on account of nothing else than\nbecause it partakes of Beauty Itself. And I speak in the same way about\neverything else. Do you accept this sort of cause or\n explanation?[2]\n\n\nIn this passage, Plato introduces two predication relations, Being\nand Partaking. Understanding how Being and Partaking function to\n\u2018tie\u2019 together the various subjects and properties\nmentioned in his metaphysical discussions is crucial to reconstructing\nhis metaphysics and epistemology. At first blush, it seems that there\nare two kinds of subjects of which properties are predicated,\nnamely Forms and material particulars. (I exempt souls from this list).\nSimilarly, at first blush it seems that there are Forms for every\nproperty involved in the changes afflicting material\n particulars.[3]\n For instance, since particulars, e.g. Helen\nof Troy, change from being not-beautiful to being beautiful, there is\nthe Form Beauty Itself. In this passage, Plato asserts that particulars\nlike Helen, because she is not the Form but rather is a material\nparticular, is related to, or \u2018tied to\u2019 Beauty in virtue of\nwhat he calls \u2018partaking.\u2019 Beauty Itself, on the other\nhand, not being something \u2018other than Beauty\u2019, does not\npartake of Beauty\u2014it simply is beautiful. Generalizing from what is\nsaid here about Beauty Itself, it seems that Forms inherit from the\nSocratic Properties their self-predicational status: Beauty is\nbeautiful; Justice is just; Equality is equal. Partaking in Beauty\nmakes Helen beautiful because Beauty Itself is beautiful. Call this way\nin which a Form is related to the property it is \u2018Being\u2019.\nUnderstanding Being, the way in which Beauty is beautiful, that is,\ndetermining what it is for a Form to self-predicate, is central to\nunderstanding Plato's Theory of Forms and his middle period\nmetaphysics.\n",
