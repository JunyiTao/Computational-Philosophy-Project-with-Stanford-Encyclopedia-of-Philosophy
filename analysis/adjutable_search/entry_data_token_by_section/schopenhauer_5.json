    "main_text": "Transcending the Human Conditions of Conflict || Moral Awareness as a Mode of Transcendence\n5.2 Moral Awareness as a Mode of Transcendence\n\nAs many medieval Christians once assumed, Schopenhauer believed that\nwe should minimize our fleshly desires, since moral awareness arises\nthrough an attitude that transcends our bodily individuality. Indeed,\nhe states explicitly that his views on morality are entirely in the\nspirit of Christianity, as well as being consistent with the doctrines\nand ethical precepts of the sacred books of India (WWR,\nSection 68). Among the precepts he respects are those prescribing that\none treat others as kindly as one treats oneself, that one refrain\nfrom violence and take measures to reduce suffering in the world, that\none avoid egoism and thoughts directed towards revenge, and that one\ncultivate a strong sense of compassion. Such precepts are not unique\nto Christianity; Schopenhauer believes that they constitute most\nreligiously-grounded moral views. Far from being immoralistic, his\nmoral theory is written in the same vein as those of Immanuel Kant\n(1724\u20131804) and John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873), that\nadvocate principles that are in general accord with Christian\nprecepts.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s conception of moral awareness coheres with his\nproject of seeking more tranquil, transcendent states of mind. Within\nthe moral realm, this quest for transcendence leads him to maintain\nthat once we recognize each human as being merely an instance and\naspect of the single act of Will that is humanity itself, we will\nappreciate that the difference between the tormentor and the tormented\nis illusory, and that in fact, the very same eye of humanity looks out\nfrom each and every person. According to the true nature of things,\neach person has all the sufferings of the world as his or her own, for\nthe same inner human nature ultimately bears all of the pain and all\nof the guilt. Thus, with the consciousness of humanity in mind, a\nmoral consciousness would realize that it has upon and within itself,\nthe sins of the whole world (WWR, Sections 63 and 64). It\nshould be noted that such a consciousness would also bear all of\nhumanity\u2019s joys, triumphs, and pleasures, but Schopenhauer does\nnot develop this thought. \n\nNot only, then, does the specific application of the principle of\nsufficient reason fragment the world into a set of individuals\ndispersed through space and time for the purposes of attaining\nscientific knowledge, this rationalistic principle generates the\nillusion that when one person does wrong to another, that these two\npeople are essentially separate and private individuals. Just as the\nfragmentation of the world into individuals is necessary to apply the\nrelationship of causality, where A causes B and\nwhere A and B are conceived to be two independent\nobjects, this same cognitive fragmentation leads us to conceive of the\nrelationships between people on a model where some person P\nacts upon person Q, where P and Q are\nconceived as two independent individuals. The conditions for\nscientific knowledge thus have a negative moral impact, because they\nlead us to regard each other as individuals separate and alien to one\nanother.\n\nBy compassionately recognizing at a more universal level that the\ninner nature of another person is of the same metaphysical substance\nas oneself, one arrives at a moral outlook with a more concrete\nphilosophical awareness. This compassionate way of apprehending\nanother person is not merely understanding abstractly the proposition\nthat \u201ceach person is a human being,\u201d or understanding\nabstractly (as would Kant) that, in principle, the same regulations of\nrationality operate equally in each of us and oblige us accordingly as\nequals. It is to feel directly the life of another person in an almost\nmagical way; it is to enter into the life of humanity imaginatively,\nsuch as to coincide with all others as much as one possibly can. It is\nto imagine equally, and in full force, what it is like to be\nboth a cruel tormentor and a tormented victim, and to locate both\nopposing experiences and characters within a single, universal\nconsciousness that is the consciousness of humanity itself. With the\ndevelopment of moral consciousness, one\u2019s awareness expands\ntowards the mixed-up, tension-ridden, bittersweet, tragicomic,\nmulti-aspected and distinctively sublime consciousness of humanity\nitself.\n\nEdmund Burke (1729\u20131797) characterized the sublime as a feeling\nof tranquillity tinged with terror, and Schopenhauer\u2019s moral\nconsciousness fits this description. Just as music embodies the\nemotional tensions within the world in an abstracted and distanced\nmanner, and thus affords a measure of tranquillity by presenting a\nsoftened, sonic image of the daily world of perpetual conflict, a\nmeasure of tranquillity also attends moral consciousness. When\nattaining the universal consciousness of humanity that transcends\nspatial and temporal determinations, the desires that derive their\nsignificance from one\u2019s personal condition as a spatio-temporal\nindividual are seen for what they are, as being grounded upon the\nillusion of fragmentation, and they thereby lose much their compelling\nforce. In this respect, moral consciousness becomes the\n\u201cquieter\u201d of the will, despite its first-person\nrecognition of human torment. Works of art that portray this kind of\nsublime consciousness would include the Laoco\u00f6n (c. 25\nB.C.E.) and Hieronymous Bosch\u2019s painting, Christ Carrying\nthe Cross (c. 1515). \n\nNegatively considered, moral consciousness delivers us from the\nunquenchable thirst that is individuated human life, along with the\nunremitting oscillation between pain and boredom. Positively\nconsidered, moral consciousness generates a measure of wisdom, as\none\u2019s outlook becomes akin to a universal novel that contains\nthe templates for all of the human stories that have been repeating\nthemselves generation after generation \u2013 stories comic and\ntragic, pathetic and triumphant, and trivial and monumental. One\nbecomes like the steadfast tree, whose generations of leaves fall away\nwith each passing season, as does generation after generation of\npeople (Homer, Iliad, Book VI).\n\nSchopenhauer maintains similarly in his \u201cEssay on the Freedom of\nthe Will\u201d (1839) that everything that happens, happens\nnecessarily. Having accepted Kant\u2019s view that cause and effect\nrelationships extend throughout the world of experience, he believes\nthat every individual act is determined by prior causes or motives.\nThis fatalistic realization is a source of comfort and tranquillity\nfor Schopenhauer, for upon becoming aware that nothing can be done to\nalter the course of events, he finds that the struggle to change the\nworld quickly loses its force (see also WWR, Section 56).\n\nSchopenhauer denies the common conception that being free entails\nthat, for any situation in which we acted, we could always have acted\ndifferently. He augments this denial, however, with the claim that\neach of us is free in a more basic sense. Noting that we have\n\u201can unshakeable certainty that we are the doers of our\ndeeds\u201d (\u201cEssay on the Freedom of the Will\u201d,\nConclusion), he maintains that our sense of responsibility reveals an\ninnate character that is self-determining and independent of\nexperience. Just as individual trees and individual flowers are the\nmultifarious expressions of the Platonic Ideas of tree and flower,\neach of our individual actions is the spatio-temporal manifestation of\nour respective innate or intelligible character.\n\nA person\u2019s intelligible character is a timeless act of Will that\nthe person essentially is, and it can be conceived of as the\nsubjective aspect of the Platonic Idea that would objectively define\nthe person\u2019s inner essence (WWR, Section 28), as a\nportrait artist might perceive it. This concept of the intelligible\ncharacter is Kantian (Critique of Pure Reason, A539/B567),\nand in conjunction with Kant\u2019s correlated concept of an\nempirical character (i.e., the intelligible character as it is\nexperientially expressed) Schopenhauer regards it as a means to\nresolve the problem of freedom and determinism, and to be one of the\nmost profound ideas in Kant\u2019s philosophy.\n\nFrom the standpoint of later philosophical influence,\nSchopenhauer\u2019s discussion of the intelligible character\nresonates with Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s injunction to \u201cbecome\nwhat one is\u201d (Ecce Homo, \u201cWhy I am so\nClever\u201d, Section 9). Schopenhauer believes that as we learn more\nabout ourselves, we can manifest our intelligible character more\neffectively, and can play our designated role \u201cartistically and\nmethodically, with firmness and grace.\u201d With self-knowledge, we\ncan transform our lives into works of art, as Nietzsche later\nprescribed.\n\nCharacter development thus involves expanding the knowledge of our\ninnate individual tendencies, and a primary effect of this knowledge\nand self-realization is greater peace of mind (WWR, Section\n55). Moreover, since our intelligible character is both subjective and\nuniversal, its status coordinates with that of music, the highest art.\nThis association with music \u2013 as Nietzsche probably observed\n\u2013 reveals a systematic link between Schopenhauer\u2019s\naesthetics and his moral theory, and it can account for\nSchopenhauer\u2019s reference to the emergence of pleasing aesthetic\nand artistic, if not musical, qualities in connection with the\nexpression of our acquired character.\n",
