    "main_text": "Aristotle\n3. Aristotle\n\nThe obvious place to begin a consideration of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea in\nAristotle\u2019s writings is in Book VI of the Nicomachean\nEthics. Here Aristotle makes a very clear distinction between the\ntwo intellectual virtues, a distinction which is not always observed\nelsewhere in his work. He begins with the rational soul (to te\nlogon echon) which is divided into the calculating part (to\nlogistikon) and the scientific part (to\nepist\u00eamonikon). With the calculating part we consider\n(the\u00f4roumen) things which could be otherwise whereas with\nthe scientific part we consider things which could not be otherwise.\nWhen he adds that calculation and deliberation are the same, he\nindicates why calculation is about what could be otherwise; no one deliberates\nabout what cannot be otherwise (1139a5\u201315). Things which could be otherwise are, e.g., the contingencies of everyday life; things which\ncould not be otherwise are, e.g., the necessary truths of mathematics.\nWith this distinction between a reality which is contingent and a\nreality which is necessary, Aristotle has laid the foundation for the\nstrong distinction between techn\u00ea and\nepist\u00eam\u00ea.\n\nThen the account turns to action (praxis), where we find the\nkind of thought that deals with what is capable of change. The\nefficient cause of actions is choice (prohairesis). The cause\nof choice is desire (orexis) and reasoning toward an end\n(logos ho heneka tinos). Thought (dianoia) by itself\nmoves nothing, only thought that is practical\n(praktik\u00ea) and for the sake of an end. So, practical\nthought (dianoia praktik\u00ea) belongs to the calculative\npart and pertains to practical truth; theoretical thought\n(the\u00f4r\u00eatik\u00ea dianoia) belongs to the\nscientific part and pertains to truth and falsity. In turn, practical\nthought governs productive (poi\u00eatik\u00ea) action. The\nlatter has an end separate from the action, i.e., the product; we will\nsee that this kind of practical thought is  techn\u00ea.\nUnderlining the way action requires the two elements of the soul,\nAristotle sums up by saying choice can be called intellect fused with\ndesire (orektikos nous) or desire fused with thought\n(orexis diano\u00eatik\u00ea) (1139a17\u20131139b5). While\nthis chapter suggests that the truth sought by practical thought is\ndifferent in kind from the truth sought by theoretical\nthought\u2014because their respective objects are different\u2014it\nends with the summary claim that attaining truth is the function of\nboth parts of the rational soul; then he turns to the virtues which\nmake the soul able to attain the truth.\n\nThere are five virtues of thought: techn\u00ea,\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, phron\u00easis,\nsophia, and nous (1139b15). Various translations\nhave been offered for each of these terms. Most often,\ntechn\u00ea is translated as craft or art. While\nepist\u00eam\u00ea is generally rendered as knowledge, in\nthis context, where it is used in its precise sense, it is sometimes\ntranslated as scientific knowledge. However, one must not confuse this\nusage with our contemporary understanding of science, which includes\nexperimentation. Conducting experiments to confirm hypotheses is a\nmuch later development. Rather, translating\nepist\u00eam\u00ea as scientific knowledge is a way of\nemphasizing its certainty. In any event, as soon as Aristotle\nintroduces these five terms, he turns to the distinction between the\nfirst two virtues. First he defines epist\u00eam\u00ea, as\nhe says, in its accurate sense and leaving aside its analogous uses.\nScientific knowledge is distinguished by its objects, which do not\nadmit of being otherwise; these objects are eternal and exist of necessity.\nMore precisely, scientific knowledge comprises demonstration, starting\nfrom first principles; the latter must also be known, although they\nare not known by demonstration (1139b15\u201330). The full account of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in the strict sense is found in\nPosterior Analytics, where Aristotle says that we think we\nknow something without qualification\n(epistasthai\u2026hapl\u00f4s) when we think we know\n(gign\u00f4skein) the cause by which the thing is, that it\nis the cause of the thing, and that this cannot be otherwise\n(71b10\u201315). As though to emphasize the necessity of what is\nknown, he most frequently uses geometry as an example of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea. In this regard, it should be pointed\nout that Aristotle uses the notion of cause (aitia) in a\nbroader sense than it usually has in contemporary thought. Thus,\nunderstanding how the geometrical axioms lead to a theorem that right\ntriangles have a certain property would be an instance, for Aristotle,\nof understanding the cause of the proven property of the right\ntriangle.\n\nThe two virtues of thought that deal with what can be otherwise, i.e.,\nwhat is contingent, are techn\u00ea and\nphron\u00easis, craft and practical wisdom. Aristotle\nemphasizes the former, a disposition (hexis) with respect to\nmaking (poi\u00easis), is distinct from the latter, a\ndisposition with respect to doing (praxis). First,\ntechn\u00ea is a disposition that produces something by way\nof true reasoning; it is concerned with the bringing into existence\n(peri genesin) of things that could either exist or not. The\nprinciple (arch\u00ea) of these things is in the one who\nmakes them, whereas the principle of those things that exist by\nnecessity or by nature is in the things themselves (1140a1\u201320).\nFor instance, carpentry makes this house and medicine produces health\nin a particular case. What is contingent is whether this house exists\nor whether health exits in this case. Since what it produces could\nexist or not, its products are one of the ways craft deals with the\ncontingent. \n\nBy contrast, practical wisdom does not make something separate the way\ncraft does. Its province is doing (praxis) and not making\n(poi\u00easis). Presumably Aristotle is relying on a\ndistinction between activity, whose end is in itself, and making,\nwhose end is a product separate from the activity of making. When\nsomeone plays the flute, e.g., typically there is no further product\nof playing; playing the flute is an end in itself. However, when one\nmakes a house, e.g., the activity of making a house is not an end in\nitself but has a product, which is separate from the activity. This\ndistinction is clearer in the opening paragraphs of the\nNicomachean Ethics. There Aristotle says that each\ntechn\u00ea, investigation, action (praxis), and\nundertaking seems to aim at some good. The ends vary, however; some\nends are the activities themselves and some ends are products\n(erga) beyond the activities. As examples of these latter\nkinds of ends, he cites health as the end of medicine, a ship as the\nend of shipbuilding, and victory as the end of generalship; these ends\nare products separate from the respective activities\n(1094a5\u201310). \n\nThe distinction between making and doing is also important for another\ndistinction, in Book Two, between craft (techn\u00ea) and\nvirtue (aret\u00ea) because virtue is a kind of doing. The\nvalue of the works (ginomena) of technai is in the\nworks themselves--because they are of a certain sort. Whereas the\nvalue of a virtuous action depends on the agent, who must act with\nknowledge (eid\u00f4s) and deliberately choose the action\nfor itself; finally, the action must come from a fixed disposition of\ncharacter. The latter two features do not belong to\ntechn\u00ea (1105a25\u20131105b5). Presumably, then, the\ncraftsman does not choose his activity for itself but for the end;\nthus the value of the activity is in what is made. In the case of\nvirtue, by contrast, the value is not in a separate product but in the\nactivity itself. In the light of what Aristotle says about the\nactivity of virtue, we can better understand practical wisdom. For it,\ndoing well (eupraxia) is an end in itself. However, this end\nis quite expansive; it is doing well as a human being, living life\nwell in general. \n\nAristotle ends this chapter by saying that practical wisdom belongs to\nthe second part of the rational soul, i.e., the part whose object is\nwhat is contingent. Its virtue is the ability to form opinion\n(doxa) with respect to what is contingent\n(1140a1\u20131140b30). Of course, craft also belongs to this part of\nthe rational soul. So, it appears that both of these intellectual\nvirtues, which deal with contingent reality, form (scil.\ntrue) opinions. In the case of techn\u00ea, the opinions are\nthe basis for production; and in the case of phron\u00easis,\nthe opinions are the basis for living well. By making explicit the\nrole of opinion in dealing with contingent reality, Aristotle has\nmarked the fundamental difference between\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, as scientific knowledge, and\ntechn\u00ea.\n\nWith this distinction we seem to have, at last, the classic division\nbetween the purely theoretical and the purely practical. Scientific\nknowledge concerns itself with the world of necessary truths, which\nstands apart from the world of everyday contingencies, the province of\ncraft. Still, there are many problems of interpretation surrounding\nthis description of scientific knowledge in Posterior\nAnalytics. While we cannot address them in this article, we can\nat least point out a central one. The description just given of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea makes scientific knowledge into a\ndeductive system in which the relations among terms are invariable and\nnecessary. The problem for commentators has been how to reconcile this\ndescription of epist\u00eam\u00ea with Aristotle\u2019s\nactual procedure in such treatises as the Physics and De\nAnima, where one does not find a deductive system of invariable\nand necessary relations. One possible explanation is that these\ntreatises are preliminary sketches for a truly scientific treatise. So\none could envision another Physics which would be a series of\ndeductions, all expressing invariable and necessary truths about\nnature. However, this charitable assessment does not avoid all\nproblems. In Metaphysics II, Aristotle explicitly undermines\nthe possibility of an epist\u00eam\u00ea, in the strict\nsense, with respect to nature. At the end of Book II, Aristotle makes\na distinction between the accuracy to be found in mathematics and that\nin other disciplines. Mathematical accuracy, he says, cannot be\nexpected in all things but only in those which do not contain matter.\nIn particular, then, one cannot expect mathematical accuracy in the\nstudy of nature since it is concerned with matter (995a15\u201320).\nIf \u2018mathematical accuracy\u2019 means the grasp of necessary\nand invariable relations among terms, then the study of nature will,\nby definition, have no such accuracy because what it studies contains\nmatter. About nature, then, we might have to settle for something less\nthan epist\u00eam\u00ea in the strict sense. Indeed, in\nBook VI of the Metaphysics, Aristotle seems to make a major\nconcession on the issue of epist\u00eam\u00ea when he says\nthat there is no knowledge of the accidental, i.e., what happens\ninfrequently, because all epist\u00eam\u00ea is of that\nwhich is always or for the most part (h\u00f4s epi to polu)\n(1027a20). Instead of grasping what is always and necessary, knowledge\ncan then grasp what happens for the most part, e.g., the regularities\nof nature, to which there are exceptions.\n\nThere is, then, some ambivalence in Aristotle\u2019s use of the term\nepist\u00eam\u00ea. For our purposes in this article, we\nwill leave suspended the question whether\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in the strict sense is achievable in the\nstudy of nature. Still, we can recognize a secondary sense of\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, since Aristotle in some contexts uses\nepist\u00eam\u00ea although the strict conditions do not\nhold. One of these contexts appears to be the study of nature. Whether\nin the study of nature epist\u00eam\u00ea in this secondary\nsense is the best that can be done or whether it can be converted into\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in the strict sense, there is still a\nsecondary sense of epist\u00eam\u00ea, one that is not\ndefined in terms of what is eternal and necessary. As we shall see,\nthis secondary sense is important for understanding the relation\nbetween techn\u00ea and epist\u00eam\u00ea.\n\nNow that we have traced Aristotle\u2019s way of distinguishing craft\nfrom scientific knowledge and from virtue, we can focus on craft as\nproductive. As we have just seen, craft produces something by way of\ntrue reasoning. Aristotle also gives us a very interesting sketch of\nthis practical reasoning at work. In an important example from\nMetaphysics VII we see how the account of the goal is the\nbasis for reasoning which ends in action. In production the form is in\nthe soul of the one who produces; in the case of medicine, health is\nsuch a form. To begin with, health is knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) and an account (logos) in the\nsoul. Then the physician engages in the following kind of reasoning:\nsince health is this particular state, if the patient is to be\nhealthy, he should have this other particular state, for instance\nhomogeneity, and if he is to have homogeneity, he should have heat.\nThe physician continues to reason in this way until he arrives at the\nlast step, the thing he can do. From this point the process, which\naims at health, is called production (1032b1\u201310).\n\nWith this sketch of practical reasoning we can come to closer grips\nwith what sorts of things could not be otherwise. Let us begin with health\nand the claim that the physician has an account of health. It is\nhealth that is the cause of the steps in the practical reasoning\nbecause it explains what is to be done. In what way does health admit\nof being otherwise? One possibility is that what constitutes health is not\ninvariable; thus the account of health would not be invariable. While\nit seems unlikely that health is variable in this sense, what\nobviously could be otherwise is whether health exists in this particular\ncase or not. If health does not exist in this case, it is up to\nmedicine to restore it. In this sense, as well, all of the steps\nprescribed by the practical reasoning could be otherwise. In the case of\nthis patient, homogeneity may or may not exist; heat may or may not\nexist. However, there is another sense in which the steps in the\nsyllogism might admit of being otherwise. Each step alleges a productive\nrelation \u2014 e.g., heat produces homogeneity. Now, there is a\nsense in which these relations could be otherwise. While heat produces\nhomogeneity, in a particular case heat causing homogeneity may or may\nnot exist because there may or may not be heat. To say of all these\nconditions that they could be otherwise, then, implies that they could or\ncould not exist. Whether these conditions exist or not depends on an\nagent bringing them into existence. So the field of craft is those\nconditions that can be brought into existence by an agent.\n\nTo this kind of contingency, however, another must be added. The\nproductive relation can be contingent in another sense. It is\ncontingent whether heat, e.g., produces homogeneity. Heat does not\ninvariably nor necessarily produce homogeneity, although it does do so\nfor the most part (Prior Analytics, 32b5\u201320). There\nare, then, two kinds of contingency possible in practicing medicine.\nThe first kind has to do with whether the physician acts or not; the\nsecond kind has to do with whether the productive relation holds or\nnot. On the one hand, if the first kind of contingency held but the\nsecond did not, the physician would have a nearly sovereign command of\nhealth. If the productive relations between heat and homogeneity and\nbetween homogeneity and health were invariable and necessary, then so\nlong as the physician could produce heat, he could invariably produce\nhealth. On the other hand, if the productive connections were not\ninvariable and necessary \u2014 but only held for the most part\n\u2014 then the physician could reliably but not invariably produce\nhealth (Metaphysics, 1026b30\u20131027a25). One could say of\ncontingent productive connections that they hold unless something\nunusual happens, that, e.g., heat always causes homogeneity unless\nsomething unusual intervenes. Accidental factors \u2014 by definition\nfactors which arise infrequently \u2014 can defeat the causal link\nbetween heat and homogeneity. But since accidental factors are\ninfrequent, one can claim that for the most part heat causes\nhomogeneity. In view of this kind of contingency, what the physician\ncan claim to know is that heat produces homogeneity unless something\nunusual intervenes. In his deliberations, what he does not know is\nwhen something unusual will happen (Nicomachean Ethics,\n1112a20\u20131112b10).\n\nScientific knowledge, in the strict sense, does not deal with these\nkinds of contingency. Nevertheless, Aristotle still describes medicine\n\u2014 which does deal with contingency \u2014 as an\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, as we have seen. Indeed, from time to\ntime, Aristotle mentions epist\u00eam\u00ea and\ntechn\u00ea in the same breath, as though they are not as\ndistinct as Nicomachean Ethics VI would make them seem. In\nthe Physics (194a20), Aristotle argues that the student of\nnature will study both form and matter. To illustrate he says that it\nbelongs to the same epist\u00eam\u00ea to study the form as\nwell as the matter; the physician, for instance, studies health as\nwell as bile and phlegm. In Nicomachean Ethics, in his\npolemic against the Platonic notion of the good itself\u2014 using\nepist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea indifferently\n\u2014 Aristotle says the physician does not study health as such but\nhuman health \u2014 even the health of this human because it is\nindividuals that he cures (1097a10\u201315). Clearly, if medicine is\nan epist\u00eam\u00ea which studies health, it is also a\ntechn\u00ea which produces health. If he were using\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in its strict sense, he ought not to\nhave called medicine epist\u00eam\u00ea. Indeed, the mixing\nof epist\u00eam\u00ea and techn\u00ea is not\nconfined to medicine. In Nicomachean Ethics II, when he\nillustrates the notion of the mean between extremes, he cites experts\nin physical training. Generalizing, he says that every\nepist\u00eam\u00ea achieves well its goal (ergon)\nby looking at the mean and using that as a standard in its products.\nThen when he says next that the good craftsmen technitai\n(craftsmen) and techn\u00ea look to the mean, he shows there\nis no hard distinction between epist\u00eam\u00ea and\ntechn\u00ea in this context (1106b5\u201315).\n\nThus, a mixed picture of epist\u00eam\u00ea and\ntechn\u00ea begins to emerge. While techn\u00ea\ndeals with things which could be otherwise, Aristotle still has a tendency to call\nit epist\u00eam\u00ea. The reason for this tendency is\nprobably that, while the person with techn\u00ea does not\nhave epist\u00eam\u00ea in the strict sense, he has\nsomething close to it. At the beginning of the Metaphysics,\nAristotle says that the person with epist\u00eam\u00ea and\nthe person with techn\u00ea share an important similarity.\nThere Aristotle contrasts the person of experience (empeiria)\nwith someone who has techn\u00ea or\nepist\u00eam\u00ea. The former knows that, when Callias had\nsuch and such disease, thus and such helped him, and the same for\nSocrates and many others. However, the person who has a\ntechn\u00ea goes beyond experience to a universal judgment.\nThis judgment is that this remedy helped all individuals of this type,\nwith this disease. Examples of the types of individuals are the\nphlegmatic and the bilious, when afflicted with a burning fever\n(981a5\u201315). However, it is important to note that the universals\ncited \u2014 phlegmatic and bilious \u2014 have a role to play in\nexplaining a fever and, thus, a role to play in the account of a cure.\nAs Aristotle says, the master craftsman (technit\u00eas) is\nwiser than the person of experience because he knows the cause, the\nreasons that things are to be done. The mere artisan\n(cheirotechn\u00eas) acts without this knowledge\n(981a30\u2013b5). Aristotle goes on to say that in general the sign of\nknowing or not knowing (tou eidotos kai m\u00ea eidotos) is\nbeing able to teach. Because techn\u00ea can be taught, we\nthink it, rather than experience, is epist\u00eam\u00ea (\n981b10). Presumably the reason that the one with techn\u00ea\ncan teach is that he knows the cause and reason for what is done in\nhis techn\u00ea. So we can conclude that the person with\ntechn\u00ea is like the person with\nepist\u00eam\u00ea; both can make a universal judgment and\nboth know the cause. Of course, the epist\u00eam\u00ea in\nquestion is not meant in the strict sense; techn\u00ea is\nlike epist\u00eam\u00ea only in the secondary sense.\n\nStill, even if the craftsman is capable of a universal judgment about\nthe cause of disease, we ought not to conclude that there is no\ndifference between techn\u00ea and\nepist\u00eam\u00ea, even in the secondary sense. We can\ntake our cue from the kind of accuracy Aristotle says is to be\nexpected in the study of the supreme good. In Nicomachean\nEthics I 3, he says that it is political science\n(politik\u00ea epist\u00eam\u00ea) which pursues\nthis study (1094b1). Since there is disagreement and error surrounding\nthe topic of the good, we must be content, concerning such a subject\nand relying on similar premises, to show the truth roughly and in\noutline. Given a subject and premises that hold for the most part\n(h\u00f4s epi to polu) similar conclusions will follow. He\nadds that it is the mark of an educated person to seek the amount of\naccuracy (takribes) that the nature of the subject matter\npermits (1094b20\u201325). Later in Book I, Aristotle returns to the\nproblem of the accuracy appropriate to different undertakings; one\nmust seek accuracy (akribeian) according to each subject\nmatter and to the degree that is appropriate to the method for\ninvestigating it. He illustrates this problem by comparing geometry\nwith carpentry. Both seek (epiz\u00eatousi) the right angle,\nthe latter insofar as it is useful for his product and the former as\nto what it is and its properties, since he is looking for the truth\n(1098a25\u201330). Here Aristotle suggests the notion of practical\naccuracy, clearly distinct from mathematical accuracy, is possibly\ndistinct from the accuracy of the study of nature. After all, the\naccuracy needed for production might also fall short of the standard\nrequired by the study of nature, even when this study is\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in the secondary sense. Finally, nothing\nin the last distinction undermines the claim that\ntechn\u00ea is clearly distinct from\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in the strict sense. The former is\nconfined to the world of contingencies; the domain of the latter is\nwhat is necessary.\n",
