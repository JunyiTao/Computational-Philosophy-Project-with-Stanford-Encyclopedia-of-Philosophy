    "main_text": "Protagoras on Language || Protagoras on correctness (orthotes)\n3.2 Protagoras on correctness (orthotes)\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective of special importance is the\nrecurrent focus on the issue of correctness of names (orthotes\nonomaton, orthoepeia), which is to say the capacity of\nlanguage to faithfully portray reality. This was the object of many\ndiscussions in fifth-century BCE Athens; Plato\u2019s\nPhaedrus reports that one of Protagoras\u2019 works was\nentitled Orthoepeia (The Correctness of Language;\nPhdr. 267c = 80A26 DK). Regrettably, the content of this book\nis completely unknown; but different sources confirm that Protagoras\nhad an interest in the problem of correctness of language at different\nlevels (Gagarin 2008: 28\u201330). We already mentioned\nProtagoras\u2019 grammatical interests, which implied the thesis of\nlinguistic correctness. On another level, the notion of\northos is used as a criterion for analysing poetry:\ncorrectness in this case concerns not points of grammar, but the\nconsistency of a composition, its statements, and its moral teaching\n(80A25 DK). Finally, the same notion could also be applied in an even\nmore general sense, as in the following testimony: \n\n\nWhen a competitor in the pentathlon unintentionally struck Epitimus of\nPharsalus with a javelin and killed him, he [i.e., Pericles] spent a\nwhole day with Protagoras examining the difficulty whether, according\nto the most correct reasoning, it was the javelin, or the man who\nthrow it, or the umpires, that should be considered responsible for\nthis unfortunate event. (80A10 DK) \n\n\nThis testimony is a fine example of Protagoras\u2019 way of\nreasoning. The facts are indisputable: a man has unintentionally\nkilled another man. However, everything remains to be said as regards\nthe issues of moral responsibility, legal guilt, and how to judge the\nwhole incident. One and the same indisputable fact may be viewed from\nmany different perspectives: for the physician, the javelin will be\nresponsible for the man's death; for the umpire, it will be the\njavelin-thrower; for the person who has organised the competition, it\nwill be the umpire. This contrast gives the sophist some room for\naction: he will attempt to create some agreement, lending meaning and\norder to the event (Untersteiner 1949 [1954: 56\u201357]). The notion\nof correctness is the criterion which enables him to overcome the\nabove difficulties: given that there is some validity to all the above\npoints of view, the problem will be to find the one most suited to the\nsituation, while foregoing any claim to come up with a single,\nindependently valid in all cases, answer. No doubt, the notion of\n\u201ccorrectness\u201d finds a prominent place in Protagoras\u2019\nthought and allows us to grasp some of its strands of continuity. At\nthe basis of this notion lies the awareness of the problematic\nrelationship between reality and human beings which was discussed in connection\nwith MM, and which finds another expression in the statement that\n\u201cconcerning every subject, there are two arguments opposed to\none another\u201d (80B6a DK). With regard to each thing there are two\nopposite logoi (speeches, arguments, points of view)\u2014A\nand non-A\u2014precisely because each experience is open to\ncontrasting readings and interpretations (thus, in the case of the\nabove example, each of the three elements can be reduced to this\nbinary logic by arguing whether it has been or not the umpire, or the\njavelin, or the javelin-thrower). Logos, which expresses our\ncapacity to think and speak, thus cannot exhaust the complexity of\nreality. However, as already noted with regard to MM, contradictory\npoints of view do not imply confusion or the failure of human\npossibilities. Rather, the challenge that Protagoras takes up and the\npromise he makes is to be able to (and teach others to) unravel this\ncomplexity by identifying which of any two opposite logoi is\nthe better, or rather the more correct, which is to say the one better\nsuited to the circumstance at hand: this is probably the meaning of\nhis well-known claim to \u201cto make the weaker argument the\nstronger\u201d (80B6b DK). It is easy to discern the structural\nanalysis that links this notion of correctness to that of the type of\nusefulness we have discussed in relation to the MM fragment: in both\ncases the problem is to find the best, most expedient relationship\nwith things in each circumstance, and this can be obtained by using\ncorrectly our logos, both in the sense of judging correctly\nthe case and convincing the others.\n\nWe here get a better idea of Protagoras\u2019 teaching, which centres\non the concept of logos, understood both as the ability to\nreason and the ability to express oneself (i.e., as both thought and\nlanguage). \u201cCorrectness\u201d, in other words, is to be\nunderstood on two levels, a conceptual and a linguistic one: correct\nreasoning, which expresses the best possible solution, must find a\ncounterpart in formal correctness, which makes one\u2019s speech\npersuasive and hence allows one to gain the upper hand in each\nparticular situation (Classen 1976: 222\u2013225). The best speech,\ntherefore, is not the speech that is true but the speech that is correct, the speech best\nsuited to the situation at hand and most capable of outdoing others\nfrom a formal and logical perspective: an irrefutable logos\n(Brancacci 2002: 183\u2013190).\n",
