    "main_text": "\n\n\nAristotle uses mathematics and mathematical sciences in three important\nways in his treatises. Contemporary mathematics serves as a model for\nhis philosophy of science and provides some important techniques, e.g.,\nas used in his logic. Throughout the corpus, he constructs mathematical\narguments for various theses, especially in the physical writings, but\nalso in the biology and ethics. Finally, Aristotle's philosophy of\nmathematics provides an important alternative to platonism. In this\nregard, there has been a revival of interest in recent years because of\nits affinity to physicalism and fictionalisms based on physicalism.\nHowever, his philosophy of mathematics may better be understood as a\nphilosophy of exact or mathematical sciences. \n\n\n\nThis article will explore the influence of mathematical sciences on\nAristotle's metaphysics and philosophy of science and will illustrate\nhis use of mathematics.\n",
