In the first role, selection is the generator and maintainer of\nthe reliability of our senses and cognitive mechanisms, as well as the\n\u201cfit\u201d between those mechanisms and the world. In the\nsecond role, trial and error learning and the evolution of scientific\ntheories are construed as selection processes. \n",
