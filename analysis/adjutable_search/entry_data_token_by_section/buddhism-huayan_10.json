    "main_text": "Li Tongxuan (635\u2013730)\n5. Li Tongxuan (635\u2013730)\n\nLi Tongxuan is a contemporary of Fazang\u2019s who remained\nrelatively unknown during his lifetime, and so he lacks the honor of\nbeing considered one of the patriarchs of Huayan Buddhism. However,\nLi\u2019s work came to exert substantial influence upon subsequent\nBuddhist tradition, through its impact on the Korean monk Chinul\n(1158\u20131210), the Japanese monk Moye (1173\u20131232), and the Linji Chan\nmasters Juefan Huihong (1071\u20131128) and Dahui Zonggao (1089\u20131163). We\nknow little about Li\u2019s life. He lived as a reclusive lay exegete\nof Buddhism, leading an austere lifestyle involving a daily meal of\nonly seven rice cakes made with dates and cypress. He also seems to\nhave had extensive knowledge of the Book of Changes (Ch.\nYijing), presumably due to his being an offspring of the Tang\nroyal family. Li influenced the Huayan tradition through a handful of\nwritings: a commentary on the Avatamsaka Sutra (Ch. Xin\nhuayan jing lun; T36.1739), a summary of that commentary, and a\nchapter-by-chapter summary of the Avatamsaka Sutra itself.\nHis writings are notable for using the theory of yin-yang and\nthe Five Phases, as well as appealing to correlative reasoning, to\ndiscern soteriological significance in minor details such as\ngeographical directions, numbers, and the names of bodhisattvas. \n\nLi\u2019s central contribution to Huayan tradition is his teaching of\nthe one true dharma-realm (Ch. yi zhen fajie).\nAccording to this teaching, all places and objects in the world are\ntrue just as they are. There is no real ontological separation between\nthe sacred and the secular, enlightenment and ignorance, or the Buddha\nand sentient beings. Li\u2019s teaching of the one true\ndharma-realm supports a subitist approach to enlightenment,\nwhereby sentient beings attain Buddhahood suddenly rather than\ngradually. It supports, as well, his decision to explicate Buddhist\nideas using classical Chinese texts, as manifested in his frequent\nappeal to the Book of Changes in his commentary on the\nAvatamsaka Sutra. According to Li, Chinese sages such as\nKongzi (Confucius) and Laozi (the traditional founder of Daoism), and\nChinese classics, offer instructions from bodhisattvas by virtue of\ntheir endeavoring to edify sentient beings\u2014and because,\naccording to Li\u2019s teaching, the ordinary human condition is the\nfoundation for enlightenment in this lifetime. \n\nLi justifies his teaching of the one true dharma-realm with a\ndistinctive and non-temporal approach to existence. According to Li,\nexistence is not only subject to change but also entirely complete at\neach moment. Past, present, and future co-exist at every moment. This\nnon-temporality of existence resolves several problems Li identifies\nwith the notions of cause and effect. The first problem pertains to\nconceptual relation. If cause and effect are not simultaneous (arising\nat one and the same moment), Li argues, then because causes are not\nconsidered causes until their effects arise, effects precede their\ncauses. If, by contrast, cause and effect are simultaneous, causes\nbecome causes exactly when effects arise. The second problem pertains\nto temporal relation. If cause and effect are not simultaneous, Li\nargues, there is an inexplicable gap between the time at which a cause\narises and the time at which the effect of that cause arises. If, by\ncontrast, cause and effect are simultaneous, there is no such gap.\n\n\nIf past, present, and future intermingle, then insofar as sentient\nbeings who are now ignorant subsequently gain enlightenment, there is\nno ontological difference between being a sentient being and being a\nBuddha: sentient beings are simultaneously Buddhas. Li here diverges\nfrom Fazang\u2019s more canonical Huayan teaching, whereby ignorance\nand enlightenment are different ontological aspects of the same one\nreality. On Li\u2019s account, the difference between sentient beings\nand Buddhas, and between ignorance and enlightenment, is merely\nepistemological, a matter of confusion about the nature and conditions\nof dukkha. \n\nLi finds scriptural support for his non-temporal approach to\nexistence, and his associated teaching of the one true\ndharma-realm, in two tales. The first, the tale of the dragon\ngirl, occurs in the Lotus Sutra, where the dragon girl\nattains enlightenment in a single moment. The second, the tale of\nSudhana, occurs in the Avatamsaka Sutra, where Sudhana\nattains enlightenment in a single lifetime. Li interprets both tales\nas examples illustrating that the moment in which the mind arises to\npractice the Buddhist path is the same as the moment in which one\nattains perfect enlightenment. Insofar as practice is the cause of the\neffect that is enlightenment, it follows that cause and effect are\nsimultaneous\u2014and so all times coexist in one moment. (For Li,\nthe tale of the dragon girl is less perfect than the tale of Sudhana,\nbecause the dragon girl, unlike Sudhana, changes her body and\ngeographical location upon attaining enlightenment.) \n",
