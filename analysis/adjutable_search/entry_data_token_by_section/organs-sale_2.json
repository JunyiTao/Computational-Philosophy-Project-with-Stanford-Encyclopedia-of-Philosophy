Therefore, at least in the absence of strong reasons to\ndo otherwise, people should be allowed to sell parts of their bodies if\nthey so wish. Whether there are any such strong reasons is of\ncourse a moot point and the main candidate reasons are discussed in\nsubsequent sections.\n\n\nNot much directly will be said about these positive arguments for\npermitting organ sale since they rely on more fundamental and general\nquestions in moral and political theory that cannot be tackled within\nthe confines of a piece on organ sale (within SEP, see the\nentries on libertarianism,\n privacy and medicine, and\n property and ownership). Later sections\nwill indirectly address these arguments, though, because many of the\nobjections to sale considered could, if successful, overturn any\ndefeasible presumption in favour of allowing\n\u2018self-ownership\u2019 to prevail.\n",
