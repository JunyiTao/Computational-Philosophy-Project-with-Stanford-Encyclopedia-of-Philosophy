Neural Network Learning and Backpropagation\n\nFinding the right set of weights to accomplish a given task is the\ncentral goal in connectionist research. Luckily, learning algorithms\nhave been devised that can calculate the right weights for carrying\nout many tasks (see Hinton 1992 for an accessible review). These fall\ninto two broad categories: supervised and unsupervised learning.\nHebbian learning is the best known unsupervised form. As each input is\npresented to the net, weights between nodes that are active together\nare increased, while those weights connecting nodes that are not\nactive together are decreased. This form of training is especially\nuseful for building nets that can classify the input into useful\ncategories. The most widely used supervised algorithm is called\nbackpropagation. To use this method, one needs a training set\nconsisting of many examples of inputs and their desired outputs for a\ngiven task. This external set of examples \u201csupervises\u201d the\ntraining process. If, for example, the task is to distinguish male\nfrom female faces, the training set might contain pictures of faces\ntogether with an indication of the sex of the person depicted in each\none. A net that can learn this task might have two output units\n(indicating the categories male and female) and many input units, one\ndevoted to the brightness of each pixel (tiny area) in the picture.\nThe weights of the net to be trained are initially set to random\nvalues, and then members of the training set are repeatedly exposed to\nthe net. The values for the input of a member are placed on the input\nunits and the output of the net is compared with the desired output\nfor this member. Then all the weights in the net are adjusted slightly\nin the direction that would bring the net\u2019s output values closer\nto the values for the desired output. For example, when male\u2019s\nface is presented to the input units the weights are adjusted so that\nthe value of the male output unit is increased and the value of the\nfemale output unit is decreased. After many repetitions of this\nprocess the net may learn to produce the desired output for each input\nin the training set. If the training goes well, the net may also have\nlearned to generalize to the desired behavior for inputs and outputs\nthat were not in the training set. For example, it may do a good job\nof distinguishing males from females in pictures that were never\npresented to it before.\n\nTraining nets to model aspects of human intelligence is a fine art.\nSuccess with backpropagation and other connectionist learning methods\nmay depend on quite subtle adjustment of the algorithm and the\ntraining set. Training typically involves hundreds of thousands of\nrounds of weight adjustment. Given the limitations of computers in the\npast, training a net to perform an interesting task took days or even\nweeks. More recently, the use of massively parallel dedicated\nprocessors (GPUs) has helped relieve these heavy computational\nburdens. But even here, some limitations to connectionist theories of\nlearning will remain to be faced. Humans (and many less intelligent\nanimals) display an ability to learn from single examples; for\nexample, a child shown a novel two-wheeled vehicle and given the name\n\u201cSegway\u201d, knows right away what a Segway is (Lake, Zaremba\net al. 2015). Connectionist learning techniques such as\nbackpropagation are far from explaining this kind of \u201cone\nshot\u201d learning.\n",
