A Life of Humanist Scholarship\n\nLipsius\u2019s changes of religious allegiance, which distressed\ncontemporary scholars and made him the target of relentless criticism,\nhave been a crucial factor in determining his reputation up to the\npresent day. To understand his motives and his philosophical\nachievements, we must examine the biographical facts.\n\nBorn a Catholic on 18 October 1547 in Overijse, a small town between\nBrussels and Louvain, Lipsius first studied in Brussels (primary\nschool, Kapelleschool; 1553\u20131557) and Ath (Latin School,\n1557\u20131559). He then pursued his studies with the Jesuits in\nCologne (at the Bursa Nova Tricoronata, 1559\u20131564), returning to\nLouvain where he matriculated at the university on 14 August 1564.\nThere he studied law, while also attending courses by Cornelius\nValerius, professor of Latin, at the Collegium Trilingue, a humanist\ninstitution of Erasmian inspiration; among his fellow students were\nLudovicus Carrio, Janus Dousa, Martin-Antonio Del R\u00edo, Andreas\nSchott. Lipsius was already engaged in the emendation and critical\nexamination of Latin texts, especially of Cicero, Propertius and\nVarro; and, as early as 1566, he put together three books of\nVariae lectiones (\u201cVariant Readings\u201d), which were\npublished in 1569 at Antwerp. He embarked on an extended academic\njourney to Italy, ending in Rome, where he became private secretary to\nCardinal Granvelle, to whom he had dedicated his Variae\nlectiones, and where he made the acquaintance of leading\nhumanists such as Marc-Antoine Muret, Fulvio Orsini, Paolo Manuzio and\nGuglielmo Sirleto.\n\nAfter his journey to Rome, where he was able to examine ancient\nmonuments and consult unique manuscripts in the Vatican Library and\nother well-stocked private libraries (1568-1570), he returned to\nLouvain to continue his legal studies. Fleeing the political and\nreligious conflict in the Low Countries, Lipsius went to visit his\nfriend Carolus Langius (Charles de Langhe) in Li\u00e8ge (1571)\n\u2014 Langius would become Lipsius\u2019s master of Roman Stoic\nphilosophy in the dialogue De constantia.\n\nIn the spring of 1572, Lipsius moved to Vienna where he was introduced\nto the humanist circle at Maximilian\u2019s court, which included\nOgerius Busbequius, Joannes Sambucus and Stephanus Pighius. In October\nLipsius obtained the chair of history at the Lutheran University of\nJena. He also completed his edition of Tacitus, which he dedicated to\nEmperor Maximilian II and in which the Annals were\ndistinguished from the Histories for the first time. He left\nJena briefly in 1573 to marry Anna van den Calstere in Cologne and\nthen for good in 1574, when he returned to the Low Countries.\n\nAfter a sojourn in Overijse and Louvain, he was invited to the\nCalvinist University of Leiden by Janus Dousa in September 1577. He\nreferred to his Leiden period (from 1578 to 1591) the most productive\nof his scholarly life. Among the numerous writings he published during\nthese years the most important were De constantia and the\nPolitica.\n\nDue to the bitter controversies arising from the publication of the\nPolitica, Lipsius decided to return to the Catholic Southern\nLow Countries, settling first in Spa and then Li\u00e8ge\n(1591\u20131592). Having re-embraced the Catholic faith of his youth,\nhe moved in August 1592 to Louvain, where he accepted the chair of\nhistory at the university and the chair of Latin at the Collegium\nTrilingue. In this final period of his life he prepared his edition of\nSeneca and his treatises on Stoic doctrines and physics. He also\ncontinued to write on classical scholarship and political philosophy,\npublishing antiquarian treatises on the cross (De cruce,\n1593), the Roman army (De militia Romana libri quinque,\n1595), Roman fortifications and armaments (Poliorceticon sive de\nmachinis, tormentis, telis libri quinque, 1596), the grandeur of\nRome (Admiranda sive de magnitudine Romana libri quatuor,\n1598), ancient libraries (De bibliothecis syntagma, 1602),\nthe Roman goddess Vesta and the Vestal virgins (De Vesta et\nVestalibus syntagma, 1605), as well as Monita et exempla\npolitica (\u201cPolitical Advice and Examples,\u201d 1605), an\nextended historical-philosophical \u201cmirror of princes,\u201d\nintended as a sequel to his Politica. In addition, Lipsius,\nappointed Royal Historiographer in 1595, was asked to write devotional\ntracts in honor of the Holy Virgin of Halle and Scherpenheuvel, thus\nsupporting the religious and political agenda of the Archdukes Albert\nand Isabella: the Diva Virgo Hallensis: Beneficia eius et miracula\nfide atque ordine descripta (1604) and Diva Sichemiensis sive\nAspricollis, nova eius beneficia & admiranda (1605).\n\nLipsius saw to the publication of his own letters, bringing out three\ncollections or Centuriae (since each contained 100 epistles),\nin his lifetime, the first of which appeared in Leiden in 1586. He\nprepared another Centuria for posthumous publication by his\nexecutor Joannes Woverius, who, together with his fellow-executors,\nadded a fifth Centuria postuma. From this vast\ncorrespondence, it is apparent that Lipsius was a central figure in\nthe Republic of Letters of his day, renowned for his philological\nskills, his historical knowledge and his search for a new type of\nhumanitas (civilized and humane conduct) suited to the\ntroubled times in which he lived. The inventory of Lipsius\u2019s\nletters includes more than 4,300 items and 700 correspondents, among\nthem not only Montaigne, but also such distinguished scholars as Isaac\nCasaubon, Henri Estienne, Joseph Scaliger, Sir Philip Sidney, Paolo\nManuzio, Fulvio Orsini, Joannes Sambucus, Joachim Camerarius, Benito\nArias Montano, Francisco de Quevedo, Abraham Ortelius, Hugo Grotius,\nand Philip Rubens, brother of the artist Peter Paul, who immortalized\nLipsius in his painting The Four Philosophers (now in the\nPalazzo Pitti in Florence). Most of the letters reflect\nLipsius\u2019s friendships, thoughts, feelings, teachings and\nattempts at self-presentation. Yet his letter collections were also\nmeant as an extension of his humanist scholarship and his Neostoic\nintellectual program.\n\nAccording to his Catholic biographers, Lipsius died in Louvain\n\u201ca devout Catholic\u201d during the night of 23 to 24 March\n1606. They recount that he asked his wife to present his fur-trimmed\nrobe to the statue of the Sedes Sapientiae in the church of\nSt Peter at Louvain and that, surrounded by three Jesuits, he\ndisplayed \u201cthe constancy of Christian strength\u201d\n(Christiani roboris constantia): when encouraged to think of\nthe consolations of Stoicism, he replied: \u201cthose things were\nvain \u2026 this [pointing to a crucifix] is true endurance\u201d\n(illa sunt vana \u2026 haec est vera patientia).\nLipsius\u2019s return to the Counter-Reformation Catholic Church in\n1591 had prepared the way for this symbolic and propagandistic use of\nhis scholarly genius and image.\n",
