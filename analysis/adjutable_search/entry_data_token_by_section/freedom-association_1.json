    "main_text": "Kinds of Associations || Intimate Associations\n1.1 Intimate Associations\n\nParadigmatically, our intimate associations with friends, family, and\nloved ones are persistent, meaningful connections marked by frequent\ndirect interactions animated by affection, interest, care, concern and\nlove. As such, they form a core part of our lives. A central feature\nof such associations is that they exist for the acts and goods of the\nassociations themselves, rather than as instruments for public\nexpression or further advantage. As Justice Douglas says of family in\nGriswold v Connecticut, \u201cIt is an association that\npromotes a way of life, not causes\u201d (381 U.S. 479 (1965)). \n\nFamilies are often held up as the paragon of intimacy,\nlove, and affection. Throughout human history, our spousal, parental,\nand sibling relations have been our primary forms of association.\nHowever, love and affection need not be the principal reasons for\nforming families. Security, financial advantage, and avoiding worse\nalternatives can all be reasons for us to marry and form families.\nNonetheless, when children are raised in families conspicuously\nlacking in love and affection, children are denied the kinds of\nassociations that are vital to their present well-being and their\nemotional, social and cognitive development (Liao 2006; 2015: ch.\n3).\n\nFriendships are also important parts of our childhood and\nadult experience. Without them, we struggle to discover, shape, and\npursue our ideas of what constitutes a good life. But, again,\nfriendships can take many forms for many reasons, not all of which are\ngrounded in mutual affection and convivial warmth (Aristotle,\nNicomachean Ethics, Book VIII). Friendships can be rooted in\nmutual advantage, status, and convenience.\n\nAs this implies, the \u201cways of life\u201d afforded to us by our\nintimate associations can lack emotional intimacy. When they do lack\nit, the qualifier \u201cintimate\u201d is a placeholder for our\n\u201cpersonal\u201d, \u201cindividual\u201d, or\n\u201cdyadic\u201d associations, rather than a description of the\nquality and value of our associative bonds. Given that emotional\ncloseness\u2014true intimacy\u2014is an important part of our\nwell-being, its presence or absence can identify the limits of the\nrights, powers, and duties we have within our intimate\nassociations.\n",
