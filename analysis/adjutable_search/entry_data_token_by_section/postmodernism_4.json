    "main_text": "Deconstruction\n5. Deconstruction\n\nThe term \u201cdeconstruction,\u201d like\n\u201cpostmodernism,\u201d has taken on many meanings in the\npopular imagination.  However, in philosophy, it signifies certain\nstrategies for reading and writing texts.  The term was introduced\ninto philosophical literature in 1967, with the publication of three\ntexts by Jacques Derrida: Of Grammatology (in English\n1974), Writing and Difference (in English 1978),\nand Speech and Phenomena (in English 1973). This so-called\n\u201cpublication blitz\u201d immediately established Derrida as a\nmajor figure in the new movement in philosophy and the human sciences\ncentered in Paris, and brought the idiom \u201cdeconstruction\u201d\ninto its vocabulary. Derrida and deconstruction are routinely\nassociated with postmodernism, although like Deleuze and Foucault, he\ndoes not use the term and would resist affiliation with\n\u201c-isms\u201d of any sort. Of the three books from 1967, Of\nGrammatology is the more comprehensive in laying out the\nbackground for deconstruction as a way of reading modern theories of\nlanguage, especially structuralism, and Heidegger's meditations on\nthe non-presence of being. It also sets out Derrida's difference with\nHeidegger over Nietzsche. Where Heidegger places Nietzsche within the\nmetaphysics of presence, Derrida insists that \u201creading, and\ntherefore writing, the text were for Nietzsche\n\u2018originary\u2019 operations,\u201d (Derrida 1974 [1967], 19),\nand this puts him at the closure of metaphysics (not the end), a\nclosure that liberates writing from the traditional logos, which\ntakes writing to be a sign (a visible mark) for another sign\n(speech), whose \u201csignified\u201d is a fully present\nmeaning.\n\nThis closure has emerged, says Derrida, with the latest developments\nin linguistics, the human sciences, mathematics, and cybernetics,\nwhere the written mark or signifier is purely technical, that is, a\nmatter of function rather than meaning. Precisely the liberation of\nfunction over meaning indicates that the epoch of what Heidegger\ncalls the metaphysics of presence has come to closure, although this\nclosure does not mean its termination.  Just as in the essay\n\u201cOn the Question of Being\u201d (Heidegger 1998, 291-322)\nHeidegger sees fit to cross out the word \u201cbeing,\u201d leaving\nit visible, nevertheless, under the mark, Derrida takes the closure\nof metaphysics to be its \u201cerasure,\u201d where it does not\nentirely disappear, but remains inscribed as one side of a\ndifference, and where the mark of deletion is itself a trace of the\ndifference that joins and separates this mark and what it crosses\nout. Derrida calls this joining and separating of\nsigns diff\u00e9rance (Derrida 1974 [1967], 23), a device\nthat can only be read and not heard when diff\u00e9rance\nand diff\u00e9rence are pronounced in French. The\n\u201ca\u201d is a written mark that differentiates independently\nof the voice, the privileged medium of metaphysics. In this\nsense, diff\u00e9rance as the spacing of difference, as\narchi-writing, would be the gram of grammatology. However,\nas Derrida remarks: \u201cThere cannot be a science of difference\nitself in its operation, as it is impossible to have a science of the\norigin of presence itself, that is to say of a certain\nnon-origin\u201d (Derrida 1974 [1967], 63). Instead, there is only\nthe marking of the trace of difference, that is, deconstruction.\n Because at its functional level all language is a system of\ndifferences, says Derrida, all language, even when spoken, is writing,\nand this truth is suppressed when meaning is taken as an origin,\npresent and complete unto itself. Texts that take meaning or being as\ntheir theme are therefore particularly susceptible to deconstruction,\nas are all other texts insofar as they are conjoined with these. For\nDerrida, written marks or signifiers do not arrange themselves within\nnatural limits, but form chains of signification that radiate in all\ndirections. As Derrida famously remarks, \u201cthere is no\noutside-text\u201d (Derrida 1974 [1967], 158), that is, the text\nincludes the difference between any \u201cinside\u201d or\n\u201coutside.\u201d As he explains in a letter to Gerald Graff,\nattached as an appendix to Limited Inc (see Derrida 1988, 148),\nthis means that \u201cevery referent, all reality has the structure\nof a differential trace.\u201d A text, then, is not a book, and does\nnot, strictly speaking, have an author. On the contrary, the name of\nthe author is a signifier linked with others, and there is no master\nsignifier (such as the phallus in Lacan) present or even absent in a\ntext. This goes for the term \u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d\nas well, which can only serve as a supplement for the productive\nspacing between signs. Therefore, Derrida insists that\n\u201cdiff\u00e9rance is literally neither a word nor a\nconcept\u201d (Derrida 1982 [1972], 3). Instead, it can only be\nmarked as a wandering play of differences that is both a spacing of\nsignifiers in relation to one another and a deferral of meaning or\npresence when they are read.\n\nHow, then, can diff\u00e9rance be characterized? Derrida\nrefuses to answer questions as to \u201cwho\u201d or\n\u201cwhat\u201d differs, because to do so would suggest there is a\nproper name for difference instead of endless supplements, of which\n\u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d is but one. Structurally,\nthis supplemental displacement functions just as, for Heidegger, all\nnames for being reduce being to the presence of beings, thus ignoring\nthe \u201contological difference\u201d between them.  However,\nDerrida takes the ontological difference as one difference among\nothers, as a product of what the idiom\n\u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d supplements. As he remarks:\n\u201cdiff\u00e9rance, in a certain and very strange way,\n(is) \u2018older\u2019 than the ontological difference or than the\ntruth of Being\u201d (Derrida 1982 [1972], 22). Deconstruction,\nthen, traces the repetitions of the supplement. It is not so much a\ntheory about texts as a practice of reading and transforming texts,\nwhere tracing the movements of diff\u00e9rance produces\nother texts interwoven with the first. While there is a certain\narbitrariness in the play of differences that result, it is not the\narbitrariness of a reader getting the text to mean whatever he or she\nwants. It is a question of function rather than meaning, if meaning\nis understood as a terminal presence, and the signifying connections\ntraced in deconstruction are first offered by the text itself. A\ndeconstructive reading, then, does not assert or impose meaning, but\nmarks out places where the function of the text works against its\napparent meaning, or against the history of its interpretation.\n",
