    "main_text": "\n\n\nIt is an important question in the historiography of modern logic\nwhether Leibniz\u2019s logical calculi influenced logic in its present\nstate or whether they were only ingenious anticipations. The most\nsignificant of Leibniz\u2019s contributions to formal logic were\npublished in the early 20th century. Only then, Leibniz\u2019s logic\ncould be fully understood. Nevertheless, the essentials of his\nphilosophy of logic and some technical elaborations could be derived\nfrom early editions of his writings published in the 18th and 19th\ncenturies.\n\n\nThe most important of these editions was Johann Eduard\nErdmann\u2019s collection of Leibniz\u2019s philosophical works\n(1839/40) which led to a first wave of reception of Leibniz\u2019s\nlogic. This edition and Adolf Trendelenburg\u2019s discussion of\nLeibniz\u2019s theory of signs on the basis of texts published in it\nallowed a further reception of Leibnizian ideas among mathematical\nlogicians at the end of the 19th century.\n",
