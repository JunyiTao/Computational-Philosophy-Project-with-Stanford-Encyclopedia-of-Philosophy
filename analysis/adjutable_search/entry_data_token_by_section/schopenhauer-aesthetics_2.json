    "main_text": "Aesthetic Experience\n3. Aesthetic Experience\n\n\nAesthetic experience comes in two main varieties for Schopenhauer,\nthe beautiful and the sublime, and can be had through perception of\nboth nature and art. Although 18th century aesthetics\nalso included the \u201cpicturesque,\u201d this drops out as a\nseparate category in both Kant and Schopenhauer\u2019s aesthetic\ntheories.\n\n\nNearly all human beings, he holds, are capable of aesthetic\nexperience, otherwise they would be \u201cabsolutely insensitive to\nbeauty and sublimity\u2014in fact these words would be meaningless for\nthem\u201d (WWR I, 218).  Notwithstanding this nearly universally\nshared capacity for aesthetic experience, Schopenhauer remarks that it\nis enjoyed only occasionally by the majority of people and is enjoyed\nin a very sustained manner and to a high degree only by the genius.\nThere are two jointly necessary and sufficient conditions for any\nproperly aesthetic experience, one subjective and one objective.\n",
