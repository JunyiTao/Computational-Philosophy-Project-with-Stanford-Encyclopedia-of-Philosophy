    "main_text": "\n\nWe discuss presupposition, the phenomenon whereby speakers mark\nlinguistically information as being taken for granted, rather than\nbeing part of the main propositional content of a speech act.\nExpressions and constructions carrying presuppositions are called\n\u201cpresupposition triggers\u201d, forming a large class including\ndefinites and factive verbs. The article first introduces a sample of\ntriggers, the basic properties of presuppositions such as projection\nand cancellability, and the diagnostic tests used to identify them.\nThe reader is then introduced to major models of presupposition from\nthe last 50 years, separated into three classes: Frege-Strawson\nderived semantic models, pragmatic models such as that offered by\nStalnaker, and dynamic models. Finally we discuss some of the main\ncurrent issues in presupposition theory. These involve accommodation,\nwhich occurs when a hearer\u2019s knowledge state is adjusted to meet the\nspeaker\u2019s presuppositions; presupposition failure, which occurs when a\npresupposition is (known to be) false; the interaction between\npresuppositions and attitudes; and variability in the behavior of\ntriggers and their presuppositions.\n",
