    "main_text": "Philosophical Assumptions in the Study of Animal Cognition || Objectivity\n2.3 Objectivity\n\nWhile one might hope that an appeal to objectivity would help to\noffset the theory-ladenness and value-ladenness of science,\nphilosophers of science tend to describe objectivity as an ideal,\nrather than an achievable result, of good science. Given that\nobjectivity can be understood as a commitment to value- and\ntheory-free faithfulness to facts that avoid any personal bias or\nperspective\u2014a view from nowhere\u2014it is at best a guide to\nbalancing biases rather than avoiding them.\n\nAnimal cognition research has a particular interest in being\nobjective, for some of the reasons reviewed in the previous two\nsections. Furthermore, as we saw in\n section 1,\n Darwin may have emphasized similarities over differences between\nspecies, suggesting a bias toward seeing other animals as like us. If\nhumans are biased towards seeing animals as too much like humans, then\nsome principles to protect against that bias may be needed. We see\nthis in two classic principles used in comparative psychology:\nMorgan\u2019s Canon and a prohibition against anthropomorphism.\n\nThe British biologist and psychologist C. Lloyd Morgan was worried\nthat the methods of Darwin emphasized our tendencies to see others as\nlike us, and he felt the need to offer a corrective to our egocentric\nbiases in the form of what is now called Morgan\u2019s Canon:\n\n\nIn no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise\nof a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome\nof the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale.\n(Morgan 1894: 53)\n\n\nMorgan describes his Canon by telling us the story of Tony, a\nfox-terrier pup who was able to open the gate from his garden and\nescape into the road by putting his head under the latch of the gate,\nlifting the latch and waiting for the gate to swing open. While it\nmight look like Tony was smart\u2014that he had a goal and knew how\nto achieve it by lifting the latch, Morgan invites us to consider\nother explanations. Perhaps Tony saw that the latch was liftable, and\nlifted it, without knowing the gate would open or wanting to get out.\nPerhaps Tony had associated the latch with getting out to the street,\nand wanted to get to the street, so he pushed against the latch\nwithout knowing how it worked. The worry is that, by thinking that\nTony was a clever little dog, an observer is being\nanthropomorphic.\n\nThough in its strictly literal sense, \u201canthropomorphism\u201d\nsimply makes reference to the attribution of human-like\ncharacteristics to animals, in its common usage in comparative\ncognition it has a very negative connotation, such that it is used to\nmake reference to the mistaken attribution of human-like\ncharacteristics to animals. Thus understood, anthropomorphism is\nconnected to humans\u2019 well-documented tendency to over-attribute\nmental states. This was already demonstrated in the 1940s, in a famous\nstudy by Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel (1944). In this study, human\nparticipants were shown a video that depicted animated geometric\nshapes moving around the screen (see Heider and Simmel (1944)\nanimation in\n Other Internet Resources\n for the video). Although the shapes make no sounds and have no facial\nexpressions, the participants couldn\u2019t help but interpret their\nmovement in intentional terms and construct a narrative regarding\ntheir \u201cinteractions\u201d. This is a particularly egregious\nexample of our anthropomorphic biases, which lead us to be inclined to\ninterpret the behavior of entities (human, non-human, and beyond) in\nhuman-like terms. Scientists studying animal cognition are well aware\nof this problematic tendency, and they attempt to counter it by\nstressing the importance of avoiding anthropomorphism.\n\nHowever, the dictum regarding the need to avoid anthropomorphism is\nalso a philosophical assumption embedded in comparative cognition and,\nas such, it can be questioned. It has been argued, for instance, that\na blanket ban against the attribution of human-like qualities to\nanimals would beg the question by assuming that said qualities are\nindeed uniquely human (Fitzpatrick 2017a). Frans de Waal (1999) uses\nthe term \u201canthropodenial\u201d to refer to the a priori\nrejection of the possibility that humans and animals may share\ncharacteristics, and argues that it is just as worrisome as\nanthropomorphism. He points out that there is an imbalance in\ncomparative cognition, such that the over-attribution of mental\ncapacities to animals is seen as much more problematic than the\nunder-attribution. The reason behind this is that comparative\npsychologists are wary of violating Morgan\u2019s Canon. However, by\nlooking to preserve cognitive parsimony at all costs, de Waal\nargues, comparative psychologists may be disregarding\nevolutionary parsimony, which dictates that we should offer\nexplanations that posit the fewest possible changes in the\nphylogenetic tree. We should thus steer clear of both anthropodenial\nand anthropomorphism. A similar point was made by Kristin Andrews and\nBrian Huss (2014), who coined the term \u201canthropectomy\u201d to\nrefer to the mistake of denying that an animal has a certain\ncharacteristically human capacity when in fact they do have that\ncapacity. They argue that anthropomorphism and anthropectomy are both\nerrors, they both amount to a false depiction of how the world\nactually is, and so there is no reason to fear one over the other.\n\nWhile anti-anthropomorphism attempts to avoid the bias of seeing mind\nwhen it isn\u2019t there, it risks placing emphasis on another bias\nthat humans are subject to, namely the bias of human exceptionalism.\nAnthropectomy arises in cases in which humans see their own cognitive\ncapacities as sophisticated, and other species as only having diluted\nversions of them. For example, it is anthropectic to observe human\ncultural practices and infer that because other species don\u2019t\nhave opera houses they don\u2019t have culture. When we make\nself-serving bias errors and assume too quickly that we are better\nthan other people, we get ourselves and other people wrong.\nAnthropectic thinking extends this bias toward other animals.\n\nMorgan also warned scientists against anthropectomy. In what we can\ncall Morgan\u2019s Challenge, he warned us not to too quickly ascribe\nsophisticated capacities as explanations of human behavior:\n\n\nTo interpret animal behavior one must learn also to see one\u2019s\nown mentality at levels of development much lower than one\u2019s\ntop-level of reflective self-consciousness. It is not easy, and savors\nsomewhat of paradox. (Morgan 1932: 250)\n\n\nMorgan\u2019s idea that we have to avoid exaggerating human\ncapacities and wrongly denying that we share capacities with other\nanimals has been taken up in current discussions of philosophers and\npsychologists. For example, as Shettleworth (2010b) points out, much\nhuman behavior is controlled by simple and often unconscious cognitive\nmechanisms of the sort we usually only associate with animals. We tend\nto disregard this and, as a result, we sometimes engage in\nanthropomorphism towards humans! Not only is there a tendency to\nforget that human behavior is often caused by simple mechanisms, one\ncan also see a propensity to exaggerate the prowess of humans at\nvarious tasks. If we are wrong about human capacities, and then deny a\ncontinuity claim because we fail to find those confabulated capacities\nin other animals, we commit a double error\u2014confabulating human\ncognitive mechanisms plus anthropocentrism, an error Cameron Buckner\ncalls \u201canthropofabulation\u201d (Buckner 2013). For example,\ndespite the fact that we know that human memory is constructive and\nconfabulatory to a large degree, many comparative psychologists engage\nin anthropofabulation by expecting animals to be capable of mentally\nreplaying past events in order to be credited with episodic memory\n(Suddendorf & Corballis 2007; Tulving 1985; cited in Buckner 2013:\n830).\n\nOne way to think of Morgan\u2019s general idea is that to explain\nanimal behavior we need to have a variety of competing hypotheses, and\nfrom that set we can then pick the one that fits best. Morgan\u2019s\nCanon suggests that psychologically lower explanations are best,\nappealing to a kind of simplicity principle associated with\nOckham\u2019s Razor. But what counts as best is a classic problem in\nthe philosophy of science. We turn to this issue next.\n",
