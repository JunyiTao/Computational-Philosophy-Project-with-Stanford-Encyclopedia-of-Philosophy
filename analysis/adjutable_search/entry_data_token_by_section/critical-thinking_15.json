    "main_text": "Required Knowledge\n10. Required Knowledge\n\nIn addition to dispositions and abilities, critical thinking needs\nknowledge: of critical thinking concepts, of critical thinking\nprinciples, and of the subject-matter of the thinking.\n\nWe can derive a short list of concepts whose understanding contributes\nto critical thinking from the critical thinking abilities described in\nthe preceding section. Observational abilities require an\nunderstanding of the difference between observation and inference.\nQuestioning abilities require an understanding of the concepts of\nambiguity and vagueness. Inferential abilities require an\nunderstanding of the difference between conclusive and defeasible\ninference (traditionally, between deduction and induction), as well as\nof the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions.\nExperimenting abilities require an understanding of the concepts of\nhypothesis, null hypothesis, assumption and prediction, as well as of\nthe concept of statistical significance and of its difference from\nimportance. They also require an understanding of the difference\nbetween an experiment and an observational study, and in particular of\nthe difference between a randomized controlled trial, a prospective\ncorrelational study and a retrospective (case-control) study. Argument\nanalysis abilities require an understanding of the concepts of\nargument, premiss, assumption, conclusion and counter-consideration.\nAdditional critical thinking concepts are proposed by Bailin et al.\n(1999b: 293), Fisher & Scriven (1997: 105\u2013106), Black\n(2012), and Blair (2021).\n\nAccording to Glaser (1941: 25), ability to think critically requires\nknowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning. If we\nreview the list of abilities in the preceding section, however, we can\nsee that some of them can be acquired and exercised merely through\npractice, possibly guided in an educational setting, followed by\nfeedback. Searching intelligently for a causal explanation of some\nphenomenon or event requires that one consider a full range of\npossible causal contributors, but it seems more important that one\nimplements this principle in one\u2019s practice than that one is\nable to articulate it. What is important is \u201coperational\nknowledge\u201d of the standards and principles of good thinking\n(Bailin et al. 1999b: 291\u2013293). But the development of such\ncritical thinking abilities as designing an experiment or constructing\nan operational definition can benefit from learning their underlying\ntheory. Further, explicit knowledge of quirks of human thinking seems\nuseful as a cautionary guide. Human memory is not just fallible about\ndetails, as people learn from their own experiences of misremembering,\nbut is so malleable that a detailed, clear and vivid recollection of\nan event can be a total fabrication (Loftus 2017). People seek or\ninterpret evidence in ways that are partial to their existing beliefs\nand expectations, often unconscious of their \u201cconfirmation\nbias\u201d (Nickerson 1998). Not only are people subject to this and\nother cognitive biases (Kahneman 2011), of which they are typically\nunaware, but it may be counter-productive for one to make oneself\naware of them and try consciously to counteract them or to counteract\nsocial biases such as racial or sexual stereotypes (Kenyon &\nBeaulac 2014). It is helpful to be aware of these facts and of the\nsuperior effectiveness of blocking the operation of biases\u2014for\nexample, by making an immediate record of one\u2019s observations,\nrefraining from forming a preliminary explanatory hypothesis, blind\nrefereeing, double-blind randomized trials, and blind grading of\nstudents\u2019 work. It is also helpful to be aware of the prevalence\nof \u201cnoise\u201d (unwanted unsystematic variability of\njudgments), of how to detect noise (through a noise audit), and of how\nto reduce noise: make accuracy the goal, think statistically, break a\nprocess of arriving at a judgment into independent tasks, resist\npremature intuitions, in a group get independent judgments first,\nfavour comparative judgments and scales (Kahneman, Sibony, &\nSunstein 2021). It is helpful as well to be aware of the concept of\n\u201cbounded rationality\u201d in decision-making and of the\nrelated distinction between \u201csatisficing\u201d and optimizing\n(Simon 1956; Gigerenzer 2001).\n\nCritical thinking about an issue requires substantive knowledge of the\ndomain to which the issue belongs. Critical thinking abilities are not\na magic elixir that can be applied to any issue whatever by somebody\nwho has no knowledge of the facts relevant to exploring that issue.\nFor example, the student in\n Bubbles\n needed to know that gases do not penetrate solid objects like a\nglass, that air expands when heated, that the volume of an enclosed\ngas varies directly with its temperature and inversely with its\npressure, and that hot objects will spontaneously cool down to the\nambient temperature of their surroundings unless kept hot by\ninsulation or a source of heat. Critical thinkers thus need a rich\nfund of subject-matter knowledge relevant to the variety of situations\nthey encounter. This fact is recognized in the inclusion among\ncritical thinking dispositions of a concern to become and remain\ngenerally well informed.\n",
