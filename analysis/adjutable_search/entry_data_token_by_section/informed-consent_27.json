    "main_text": "Consent in other domains\n10. Conclusion: the core of informed consent\n\nThe turn of the 21st century has seen doubts surfacing about informed\nconsent, but that just makes the resilience of other parts of the\nrequirement all the more striking. Even purported critics usually\nrevise only the requirement\u2019s prevalent justifications and\ninterpretations in borderline areas, and leave a certain\n\u201ccore\u201d intact. Given how much philosophers usually\ndisagree, it is remarkable that, when a medical intervention is risky,\nvalue-laden, high-impact, physically invasive, and/or medically\ncontroversial, especially when a patient of sound mind explicitly\nrefuses the intervention, most of us would feel that only the most\ndire costs would justify imposition of care. The grudging nature of\nrelative skeptics\u2019 acceptance of this core part of the\nrequirement only attests to its philosophical resilience.\n\nIn seeking justification for the requirement of informed consent, we\nmay therefore not have one task, but many. We need to justify this\npowerful, relatively non-controversial core, as well as a weaker and\nmore questionable rim. It is possible that the core stems directly\nfrom natural right, whereas the rim is merely instrumental or\nconventional. It is also possible that they both rely on the same\nground, say, the value of autonomy, but touch on it in different\nmeasures. Even if the core of the requirement of informed consent\ncommands high priority, other parts may turn out to be easily\noverridable by competing values, including the value of advancing\nscientific research.\n",
