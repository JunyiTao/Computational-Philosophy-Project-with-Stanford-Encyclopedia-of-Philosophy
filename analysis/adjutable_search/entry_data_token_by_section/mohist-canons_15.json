    "main_text": "Argumentation and Logic\n7. Argumentation and Logic\n\nAs we have seen, Mohist semantics and epistemology are grounded in the\nnotion of distinguishing things as \u201cthe same\u201d\n(t\u00f3ng \u540c) or \u201cdifferent\u201d\n(y\u00ec \u7570). To predicate a general term of\nsomething is to distinguish it as similar to, or of a kind\n(l\u00e8i \u985e) with, other things denoted by that\nterm. Knowledge and understanding are explained in terms of the\nability to distinguish and name things correctly. In this theoretical\nframework, judgment amounts to the act of either grouping things\ntogether as \u201csimilar\u201d or \u201cthe same\u201d or\ndistinguishing them as \u201cdifferent.\u201d An assertion is in\neffect a claim that something is or is not \u201cthe same\u201d or\n\u201cof a kind\u201d with something else. Thus argumentation or\ndisputation\u2014the process of supporting an assertion by citing\nother, established claims\u2014is typically seen as a process of\ndistinguishing whether two things are or are not \u201cthe\nsame\u201d or whether something belongs to a certain kind. \n\nAs might be expected, given this background, the Mohists\u2019\nlogical investigations focus on analogical reasoning, and indeed they\ntend to treat all argumentation as fundamentally analogical in nature.\nThey do not investigate formal logic or deductive inference, nor\nformulate an explicit notion of logical consequence. They do apply\nversions of the laws of excluded middle and non-contradiction, along\nwith concepts of logical \u201cpermissibility\u201d\n(k\u011b \u53ef) and \u201cperversity\u201d\n(b\u00e8i \u6096, \u8a96) that are intertwined with a\nrough notion of logical\n consistency.[22]\n They also employ a rigorous system of quantifiers and conjunctions of\nimplication. Still, none of these logical notions is addressed as an\nexplicit topic of investigation, nor are they organized and presented\nin a systematic way. The Mohists\u2019 discussion focuses on\nsemantics and analogical argumentation.\n\nThe Mohists refer to the field of activity in which we support,\nevaluate, and argue over assertions as bi\u00e0n \u8faf,\na word interpretable as \u201cdialectics,\u201d \u201cdistinction\ndrawing,\u201d \u201cdiscriminating,\u201d or\n\u201cdisputation.\u201d (For convenience, we will translate it as\n\u201cdisputation,\u201d though, as we will see, Chinese thinkers\nunderstand it very literally as a process of\n\u201cdiscriminating,\u201d or drawing distinctions.) Early Chinese\ntexts describe disputation at several levels of\n generality.[23]\n In its broadest sense, disputation is extensive in scope, covering\naspects of semantics, argumentation, logic, and rhetoric. It is\ncomparable to the Greek notion of dialectics, considered loosely as\ndebate or reasoning aimed at knowledge. The Mohists\u2019\n\u201cLesser Selection\u201d (Xi\u01ceo Q\u01d4) depicts it\nas a general process of reasoning and judgment that covers virtually\nall cognitive activity, including topics corresponding to politics,\nsemantics, natural science, and ethics. \n\nDisputation (bi\u00e0n \u8faf), by it we clarify\ndivisions between this (sh\u00ec \u662f) and not-this\n(f\u0113i \u975e) to examine the guidelines of order and\ndisorder; clarify points of sameness and difference to discern the\npatterns of names (m\u00edng \u540d) and stuff\n(sh\u00ed \u5be6); and settle benefit and harm to resolve\nuncertainty and doubt. Only then can we lay out what is so of the\nmyriad things and sort out parallels in groups of statements. (NO6)\n\n\nOther texts portray disputation as a competitive, argumentative\nactivity, a kind of public debate or dispute. The narrowest, most\nspecific descriptions depict it as a process of arguing over whether,\nwith respect to some name or term (m\u00edng), something is\nsh\u00ec (this) or f\u0113i (not-this), part of\nthe extension of the term or not. Any two or more things that are\nsh\u00ec (this) are thereby \u201cthe same\u201d in some\nway. So disputation is in effect a process of distinguishing what is\nor is not \u201cthe same.\u201d At each level of generality, it is\nsaid to involve distinguishing sh\u00ec/f\u0113i\n\u662f\u975e (this/not-this) and t\u00f3ng/y\u00ec\n\u540c\u7570 (same/different). Disputation in the narrow sense of\narguing over whether a term can properly be predicated of a thing is\nprobably the basic component activity of disputation in the wider\nsenses. Disputation in the broadest sense of \u201cdebate\u201d or\n\u201cdialectics\u201d is in effect an extended process of\ndisputation in the narrow\n sense.[24]\n\n\nCanons A73\u201374 give a precise explication of disputation in its\nmost concrete sense. It is contending over which of two complementary\nterms, such as \u2018ox\u2019 and \u2018non-ox\u2019,\n\u201cfits\u201d (d\u00e0ng \u7576) a thing\n(sh\u00ed) (A74). Such pairs of terms divide everything in\nthe world into two mutually exclusive categories: any one thing is\neither ox or non-ox. In disputation, one side calls a thing\n\u201cox,\u201d the other \u201cnon-ox\u201d; the side whose claim\nfits the thing wins. The text cites a version of the law of excluded\nmiddle (A73) to show that at least one of the pair of terms must fit\nand a version of the law of non-contradiction (A74) to show that at\nleast one must fail to\n fit.[25]\n The speech act of calling the thing \u201cox\u201d or\n\u201cnon-ox\u201d has the pragmatic significance of an assertion,\nand so disputation can be understood by our lights as a debate over\nwhich of two contradictory assertions is true. But the Mohists do not\nview it this way. They see it as contending over whether the\nsh\u00ed (stuff, thing) at hand is of the kind ox\nor not. Equivalently, they see it as debating whether, with respect to\nthe term \u2018ox\u2019, the thing at hand is \u201cthis\u201d\n(sh\u00ec) or \u201cnot-this\u201d\n(f\u0113i)\u2014whether the term \u201cfits\u201d it or\nnot. \n\nHow do we determine whether something is \u201cthis\u201d or not? As\nexplained in\n section 4.1,\n we cite a\n model or paradigm (f\u01ce \u6cd5)\n of the kind in question and try to show that the thing is or is not\nrelevantly similar to it. A thing is \u201cso\u201d\n(r\u00e1n \u7136) when its \u201clooks\u201d\n(m\u00e0o \u8c8c, observable features) are similar\n(ru\u00f2 \u82e5) to the model (f\u01ce)\n(A70\u201371). Models may include a thought of the thing, measuring\ntools or other devices for identifying it, or concrete examples.\nThings can \u201cmatch\u201d (h\u00e9 \u5408) the model\n\u201cexactly,\u201d as when a circle is exactly the same shape as\nthe model, or by what is \u201cappropriate,\u201d as when we deem a\nman \u201cswarthy\u201d by the color of his skin, not his hair or\neyes (A83, A96). The overall process of citing a model, explaining the\nreasons for distinguishing something as \u201cthis\u201d or\n\u201cnot-this,\u201d and thus achieving understanding is called\n\u201cexplanation\u201d or \u201cpersuasion\u201d\n(shu\u014d \u8aaa) (A72, NO11). \u201cExplanation\u201d\n(shu\u014d) is the analogue, in the Chinese context, of\ngiving an argument for a claim. However, an \u201cexplanation\u201d\nhas no particular formal structure. Nor is it regarded as proving a\nconclusion; the Mohists develop no conception of deductive proof. It\nis simply the process of explaining the grounds (g\u00f9\n\u6545) for distinguishing something as \u201cthis\u201d or\n\u201cnot-this.\u201d \n\nA series of canons following those just discussed describe detailed\nprocedures for disputation, but textual and interpretive problems\nplace them beyond the scope of this article. Several other\ncanons\u2014equally obscure, but worth summarizing briefly\nhere\u2014identify potential problems in disputation. These have two\nmain sources: the inherently fallible nature of analogical extension\nand the Mohists\u2019 discovery that similar grammatical structure\nneed not reliably reflect similar semantics. \n",
