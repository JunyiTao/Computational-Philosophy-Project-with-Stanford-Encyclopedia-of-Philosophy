Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s first and most influential\nargument against his philosopher opponents appears to target\nAvicenna\u2019s necessitation thesis (Lizzini 2013). He\nwrites,\n\n\nThe connection between what is habitually believed to be a cause and\nwhat is habitually believed to be an effect is not necessary,\naccording to us. But [with] any two things, where \u201cthis\u201d\nis not \u201cthat\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d is not\n\u201cthis\u201d and where neither the affirmation of the one\nentails the affirmation of the other nor the negation of the one\nentails negation of the other, it is not a necessity of the existence\nof the one that the other should exist, and it is not a necessity of\nthe nonexistence of the one that the other should not exist\u2014for\nexample, the quenching of thirst and drinking, satiety and eating,\nburning and contact with fire, light and the appearance of the sun,\ndeath and decapitation [\u2026] and so on to [include] all [that is]\nobservable among connected things in medicine, astronomy, arts, and\ncrafts. Their connection is due to the prior decree of God, who\ncreates them side by side, not to its being necessary in itself,\nincapable of separation. (al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b IP: 166)\n\n\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b denies that natural events involve necessary\nconnections, using as his main example the burning of cotton when in\ncontact with fire:\n\n\nFor we allow the possibility of the occurrence of the contact without\nthe burning, and we allow as possible the occurrence of the\ncotton\u2019s transformation into burnt ashes without contact with\nthe fire. [The philosophers], however, deny the possibility of this.\n(al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b 2000: 166\u20137)\n\n\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b appears to attribute to his Aristotelian\nopponents two main claims:\n\n(i)\nnatural substances, such as fire, are causes, and\n(ii)\ncausal connections are necessary connections.\n \n\n\nHe also contends that (i) and (ii) imply a third claim:\n\n(iii)\nthe affirmation of contact between fire and cotton entails the\naffirmation of the burning of the cotton.\n\n\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b suggests that, because (iii) is false, his\nopponents\u2019 account of causation in nature is mistaken. One\nquestion raised by the argument is whether his opponents really accept\n(ii); another is whether they consider (i) and (ii) to imply\n(iii).\n",
