    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || Pre-Civil Societies\n4.1 Pre-Civil Societies\n\nLike physical bodies, the moral body of the state is substantively\ncomposed of lesser members, particularly the simple and thus primary\nassociations (collegia) of marriage, family, and household\n(DJN VI.1.1). In their reproductive, rearing, and economic functions,\nthese basic societies mainly address the problem of human want or\nneed, though they also offer a minimal level of security. Their\nexistence shows that social cooperation is not suddenly imposed on\nisolated human beings with the creation of states, but that the latter\nis an additional form of association introduced to protect and\nmaintain already existing social units. Despite the natural\ninclinations that induce individuals to form or enter them, these\nproto-civil arrangements are, like states, based on agreements, and\nthey exhibit authority relations more or less analogous to civil\nsovereignty (DJN VI.2.11). The latter becomes necessary only when\npre-civil societies increase in size, number, and complexity to the\npoint where their interactions become dysfunctional and security\nproblems unmanageable. As in the case of other moral entities that are\nsuperimposed on one another, states do not replace pre-civil societies\nbut only protect, order, and \u2013 under certain conditions \u2013\nutilize them. At the same time, especially in the case of other types\nof sub-state associations such as churches, they may also liberate\nindividuals from them (by divorcing civil from religious authority,\nand allowing religious diversity in the state). (See Seidler\n2002.)\n4.1.1 Marriage\n\nSince it regulates reproduction, without which human society would\ncease to exist, the institution of marriage is \u201cthe foundation\nof social life\u201d (DJN VI.1.7; Dufour 1972, Ehrle 1952). Humans\nare obligated to enter it, though only in a general way that\npresupposes capacity, opportunity, and other facilitating conditions.\nDespite being commanded by God \u2013 like other natural law\nobligations \u2013 its immediate origins lie in each instance in a\nconsensual pact between basically equal partners (DJN VI.1.12). This\nholds even where a woman\u2019s (express or tacit) consent \u2013\nlike terms of captivity in general \u2013 follows upon (a just) war\n(DJN VI.1.9, 1.12; VI.3.5\u20136). Though its end differs from that\nof the state (reproduction vs. security), the marital unification of\nwills may establish a hierarchical, quasi-sovereignty relationship\nbetween spouses, one of whom agrees to submit to the other\u2019s\nauthority; on the other hand, marriage may have the character of an\n\u201cunequal confederation,\u201d which also requires diverse but\nmutual performance (i.e., command and obedience; DJN VI.1.11). What is\nimpermissible in both cases and institutions, however, because of its\nsupposed dysfunctionality for governance, is a divided command or two\nheads.\n\nThis forces a choice upon Pufendorf\u2019s contractual\negalitarianism, which is tempered here by his material assumptions\nabout the \u201cpreeminence\u201d of the husband\u2019s sex, and\nabout women\u2019s allegedly unreasonable demand for additional\nresponsibilities. These are not absolute pronouncements, however, but\nconclusions of the \u201cruling prudence\u201d that is the\n\u201cpleasant sister of natural law\u201d; that is, they rest upon\nan empirical, pragmatic assessment of spouses\u2019 respective\nabilities and burdens (DJN VI.1.11,18). It is important to recall in\nthis context the difference between modern and medieval natural law,\nand that Pufendorf does not conceive human nature in essentialist\nterms but rather generalizes (rightly or wrongly) from experience.\nThat is, apart from his personal presuppositions, his is an empirical\nand not a metaphysical argument, and this makes it both circumstantial\nand corrigible. To dismiss it out of hand ironically risks reaffirming\nthe very approach that he rejected (in general), and to overlook the\nflexibility and liberatory potential of his conception of natural law\n(Drakopolou 2013).\n\nBesides, Pufendorf reassures, in marriages and states alike,\nsovereignty does not exclude the possibility of mutual affection, and\nspouses do not command each other in all respects but only those that\nserve the institution\u2019s fundamental end. Thus, matters like the\ndisposition of a wife\u2019s dowry and other assets depend on the\nstipulations of the original marriage agreement (DJN VI.1.11), much\nlike the preliminary constraints imposed upon limited civil\nsovereignty by a state\u2019s fundamental laws. Pufendorf also\nextends his analysis into the controversial subject of polygamy\n\u2013 which he deemed rationally elusive and sometimes permissible\n(DJN VI.1.16\u201318; Vogel 1991) \u2013 and into the topic of\ndivorce, where he qualifies Milton\u2019s views on the subject (DJN\nVI.1.24; Palladini 2001). These and other discussions are historically\nand circumstantially embedded, which accounts for their considerable\nlength and detail, especially when compared with shorter treatments in\nother early modern authors like Hobbes and Locke. Textual comparisons\nwith these can be useful and enlightening (Sreedhar 2014), especially\nif historical and philosophical contexts are also kept in view\n(Doy\u00e9 2012, Hull 1996, Buchholz 1988, Rinkens 1971, Dufour\n1972).\n4.1.2 Family\n\nOne human institution generates and qualifies another as the parental\nrole supervenes on that of marital partner. Here Pufendorf follows\nHobbes in holding that mere generation cannot ground parental\nauthority (just as place of birth alone cannot ground patriotism), and\nthat this depends instead on a tacit pact based on utility (DJN\nVI.2.2). Children supposedly assent to their subjection in order to\nsurvive, and because otherwise the beneficial ends of parenthood,\nwhich include the rearing, socializing, and civic education of\noffspring, cannot be attained. Moreover, he concurs, though mothers\nhave primary authority over children in the state of nature where\nparents are roughly equal, fathers typically acquire supremacy through\nmarriage pacts, which may be dictated by civil laws (DJN\nVI.2.4\u20135). As in the spousal relationship and for similar\nreasons, parents cannot be equally authoritative or sovereign\nvis-a-vis their children, but one or the other must prevail. Though\nthis is usually the male, Pufendorf excepts Amazons and contemporary\nqueens in whom the civil sovereignty reposes for dynastic reasons, and\nwhose husbands are not kings but mere \u201cspouses of queens.\u201d\n(DJN VI.2.5) Also, like marital authority, parental power is limited\nby the institution\u2019s end and normally excludes the right of life\nand death, and the ability to void grown children\u2019s marriages.\n(DJN VI.2.14) It ceases when children come of age and are emancipated,\nthough (as in the case of emigration, DJN VIII.11.3\u20134) it may be\nextended beyond that point because of special circumstances, including\nother pacts. Children always owe their parents imperfect duties of\nequity and gratitude (DJN VI.2.11).\n4.1.3 Household\n\nHerilic or master-slave relationships are similar to but stricter than\nparental ties, and they have no natural expiration point. They too are\nbased on express or tacit pacts, with no natural basis beside the\nqualifying suitability of some persons to rule and others to be ruled\n(DJN VI.3.1\u20132) \u2013 which, alone, is insufficient to justify\nthem. Pufendorf conceives them as sovereignty- rather than as\nproperty-relationships (DJN VI.3.7), strictly speaking, and regards\nslaves not as things but as \u201cperpetual mercenaries\u201d (DJN\nVI.3.4) who always retain an \u201cintrinsic liberty of the\nwill\u201d (DJN VI.3.10). Slavery (or servitude \u2013 the category\nis wider or more diverse than often acknowledged) does not extinguish\nthe laws of humanity or erase all traces of humans\u2019 original\nequality, even though it is possible for them to bargain away\n(permanently) their freedom to command themselves (DJN VI.3.9). Even\nthe offspring of slaves may be retained in that status, especially\nwhen it has been entered through war, although humanity (vs. right)\nfavors their liberation. States may regulate herilic relationships\nlike marital and parental ties, for appropriate reasons, even though\nthey often do not interfere. Slavery may be ended by manumission,\nbanishment, a failure to specify the status of slaves in one\u2019s\nwill, and \u2013 notably \u2013 by putting a slave into chains\n(except for a crime, or as punishment). In the last case and any other\nunjustified deprivation of bodily freedom, a slave is released from\nhis initial, pact-based obligation, which depends on reciprocity:\n\u201cFor there is no pact unless contractors trust each other, and\nfaith cannot be violated where it does not exist.\u201d That is,\nphysical bonds replace or sublate moral ones, and in such a case a\nslave is free to go (i.e., run away) (DJN VI.3.6, 3.11). These reasons\nare similar to those why the civil bond between ruler and ruled may be\nbroken.\n",
