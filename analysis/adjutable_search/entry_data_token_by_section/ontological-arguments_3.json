Uses of Ontological Arguments\n\nBefore we turn to assessment of ontological arguments, we need to get\nclear about what the proper intended goals of ontological arguments\ncan be. Suppose we think of arguments as having advocates and targets:\nwhen an advocate presents an argument to a target, the goal of the\nadvocate is to bring about some change in the target. What might be\nthe targets of ontological arguments, and what might be the changes\nthat advocates of these arguments aim to bring about in those targets?\n\n\nHere are some proposals; no doubt the reader can think of others: \n\nThe targets might be atheists, and the goal might be to turn them\ninto theists. \nThe targets might be agnostics, and the goal might be to turn them\ninto theists. \nThe targets might be theists, and the goal might be to improve the\ndoxastic position of theists. \nThe targets might be professional philosophers, and the goal might\nbe to advance understanding of the consequences of adopting particular\nlogical rules, or treating existence as a real predicate, or allowing\ndefinitions to have existential import, or the like. \nThe targets might be undergraduate philosophy students, and the\ngoal might be to give them some sufficiently frustrating examples on\nwhich to cut their critical teeth. \n\n\nIn the coming discussion, it will be supposed that the targets are\natheists and agnostics, and that the goal is to turn them into\ntheists. Suppose that an advocate presents an ontological argument to\na target. What conditions must that arguments satisfy if it is fit for\nits intended purpose? A plausible suggestion is that, minimally, it\nshould make the targets recognise that they have good reason to accept\nthe conclusion of the argument that they did not recognise that they\nhave prior to the presentation of the argument. Adopting this\nplausible suggestion provides the following criterion: a successful\nontological argument is one that should make atheists and agnostics\nrecognise that they have good reason to believe that God exists that\nthey did not recognise that they have prior to the presentation of the\nargument. Note that this criterion has a normative dimension: it\nadverts to what atheists and agnostics should do when presented with\nthe argument. \n\nThere is an important discussion to be had about whether we should\nsuppose that the targets of ontological arguments are atheists and\nagnostics, and that the goal is to turn them into theists. However, it\nis simply beyond the scope of this entry to pursue that discussion\nhere. \n",
