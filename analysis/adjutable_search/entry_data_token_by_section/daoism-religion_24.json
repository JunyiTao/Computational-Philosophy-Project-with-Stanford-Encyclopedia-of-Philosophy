    "main_text": "Gods and Rituals || The Function of Writing\n5.3 The Function of Writing\n\nThe highest gods reveal texts, teachings, and methods either directly\nor through their representatives. For instance, the Shangqing and\nLingbao scriptures are deemed to have taken shape from self-generated\ngraphs coagulated from Original Breath (Robinet 1993: 21\u201324), or\nfrom sounds generated by its vibration (Bokenkamp 1997: 386\u201387),\nin the early stages of the formation of the cosmos. They were\ntransmitted in Heaven until a \u201cdivine being\u201d or an\n\u201cimmortal\u201d transcribed them into characters understandable\nto humans.\n\nJust like the gods usually grant revelations in the form of\nscriptures, the typically Daoist form of communicating with the gods\nis by writing: as Anna Seidel remarked, the Chinese deities\n\u201cneither speak nor listen, but write and read\u201d (1997: 43).\nIn Daoist ritual, the priest delivers a \u201cmemorial\u201d (or\n\u201cstatement\u201d, shu) to the gods in order to\nannounce the ceremony performed in their honor, declare its purpose,\nspecify its program, and list the names of those who sponsor it\n(Schipper 1974). The so-called talismans (fu, a word almost\nexactly corresponding to the original meaning of Greek\nsymbolon) are traced on paper or other supports in graphs\nhardly comprehensible to humans but intelligible to the gods (Despeux\n2000; Mollier 2003). Like the revealed scriptures\u2014some of which,\nin fact, are deemed to have evolved from them\u2014talismans have\ncounterparts in Heaven, and thus serve to identify and authenticate\ntheir possessors in front of the gods. They confer the power to summon\ncertain deities and to control demons, but also protect space and heal\nillnesses; they are worn on one\u2019s body, affixed at the four\ndirections, placed along the path that leads to one\u2019s dwelling,\nor made into ashes and drunk with water.\n",
