    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nCassirer was born on July 28, 1874 to a wealthy and cosmopolitan\nJewish family,in the German city of Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland).\nPart of the family lived in Berlin, including Cassirer\u2019s cousin\nBruno Cassirer, the distinguished publisher, who later published most\nof Cassirer\u2019s writings. Cassirer entered the University of\nBerlin in 1892. In 1894 he took a course on Kant with Georg Simmel,\nwho recommended Hermann Cohen\u2019s writings on Kant in particular.\nCohen, the first Jew to hold a professorship in Germany, was the\nfounder of the so-called Marburg School of neo-Kantianism, famous for\ninterpreting Kant\u2019s transcendental method as beginning with the\n\u201cfact of science\u201d and then arguing regressively to the\npresuppositions or conditions of possibility of this\n\u201cfact.\u201d Kant was thus read as an \u201cepistemologist\n[Erkenntniskritiker]\u201d or methodologist of science\nrather than as a \u201cmetaphysician\u201d in the tradition of\npost-Kantian German idealism. After learning of Cohen\u2019s writings\nfrom Simmel, Cassirer (then nineteen years old) proceeded to devour\nthem, whereupon he immediately resolved to study with Cohen at\nMarburg. He studied at Marburg from 1896 to 1899, when he completed\nhis doctoral work with a dissertation on Descartes\u2019s analysis of\nmathematical and natural scientific knowledge. This appeared, in turn,\nas the Introduction to Cassirer\u2019s first published work, a\ntreatment of Leibniz\u2019s philosophy and its scientific basis\n[Cassirer 1902]. Upon returning to Berlin in 1903, Cassirer further\ndeveloped these themes while working out his monumental interpretation\nof the development of modern philosophy and science from the\nRenaissance through Kant [Cassirer 1906, 1907a]. The first volume of\nthis work served as his habilitation at the University of Berlin,\nwhere he taught as an instructor or Privatdozent from 1906 to\n1919.\n\nIn 1919 Cassirer was finally offered professorships at two newly\nfounded universities at Frankfurt and Hamburg under the auspices of\nthe Weimar Republic. He taught at Hamburg from 1919 until emigrating\nfrom Germany in 1933. During these years Cassirer completed his\nthree-volume Philosophy of Symbolic Forms [Cassirer 1923,\n1925, 1929b], which broke fundamental new ground beyond the\nneo-Kantianism of the Marburg School and articulated his own original\nattempt to unite scientific and non-scientific modes of thought\n(\u201csymbolic forms\u201d) within a single philosophical vision.\nIn 1928 Cassirer offered a defense of Weimar [Cassirer 1929a] at the\nUniversity\u2019s celebration of the tenth anniversary of the\nRepublic, and in 1929\u201330 he served as the rector of the\nUniversity, as the first Jew to hold such a position in Germany. In\nthe Spring of 1929 Cassirer took part in a famous disputation with\nMartin Heidegger in Davos, Switzerland, where Heidegger explicitly\ntook Cohen\u2019s neo-Kantianism as a philosophical target and\ndefended his radical new conception of an \u201cexistential analytic\nof Dasein\u201d in the guise of a parallel interpretation of the\nphilosophy of Kant [Heidegger 1929]. Cassirer, for his part, defended\nhis own new understanding of Kant in the philosophy of symbolic forms\n\u2013 against Heidegger\u2019s insistence on the ineluctability of\nhuman finitude \u2013 by appealing to genuinely objectively valid,\nnecessary and eternal truths arising in both moral experience and\nmathematical natural science (see [Friedman 2000] [Gordon 2010]).\n\nAfter his emigration Cassirer spent two years lecturing at Oxford and\nthen six years at the University of G\u00f6teborg in Sweden. During\nthis time he developed his most sustained discussion of morality and\nthe philosophy of law as a study of the Swedish legal philosopher Axel\nH\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m [Cassirer 1939a] (see [Krois 1987, chap. 4]). He\nalso articulated his major statement on the relationship between the\nnatural sciences and the \u201ccultural sciences\u201d [Cassirer\n1942], which contained, among other things, an explicit rejection of\nRudolf Carnap\u2019s \u201cphysicalism\u201d (see [Friedman 2000,\nchap. 7]). Cassirer, like so many German \u00e9migr\u00e9s during\nthis period (including Carnap) then finally settled in the United\nStates. He taught at Yale from 1941 to 1944 and at Columbia in\n1944\u201345. During these years he produced two books in English\n[Cassirer 1944, 1946], where the first, An Essay on Man,\nserves as a concise introduction to the philosophy of symbolic forms\n(and thus Cassirer\u2019s distinctive philosophical perspective) as a\nwhole and the second, The Myth of the State, offers an\nexplanation of the rise of fascism on the basis of Cassirer\u2019s\nconception of mythical thought. Two important American philosophers\nwere substantially influenced by Cassirer during these years: Arthur\nPap, whose work on the \u201cfunctional a priori\u201d in physical\ntheory [Pap 1946] took shape under Cassirer\u2019s guidance at Yale,\nand Susanne Langer, who promulgated Cassirer\u2019s philosophy of\nsymbolic forms in aesthetic and literary circles (see, e.g., [Langer\n1942]). Cassirer\u2019s American influence thus embraced both sides\nof his philosophical personality. One can only speculate on what this\ninfluence might have been if his life had not been cut short suddenly\nby a heart attack while walking on the streets of New York City on\nApril 13, 1945.\n",
