From one of\nhis earliest books, Art et scolastique (1920, Art and\nScholasticism), through work addressing the painter Georges\nRouault and the author, Jean Cocteau (e.g., Art and Faith: Letters\nBetween Jacques Maritain and Jean Cocteau, 1926 [1948]), to\nFronti\u00e8res de la po\u00e9sie (1935, Art and\nPoetry), Situation de la po\u00e9sie (1938, The\nSituation of Poetry), Creative Intuition in Art and\nPoetry (1953) and The Responsibility of the Artist\n(1960), one finds sustained attention given to the topic, and\nreferences to art appear throughout his work, particularly in his\nepistemology. This should be no surprise. Maritain\u2019s wife,\nRa\u00efssa, was a poet, and Maritain counted among his friends and\nacquaintances the artists, Marc Chagall and Georges Rouault, the\nauthors Georges Bernanos, Jean Cocteau, and Julien Green, and the\ncomposer Arthur Louri\u00e9.\n\nThe focus of Maritain\u2019s writing is not aesthetic theory or even\naesthetic experience, but art and the nature of beauty. Maritain\nsought to engage the world of the contemporary arts, but he was also\ncritical of much of the aesthetics that was implied by it; he proposed\nto uncover principles of art at a time at which talk of such\nprinciples had already become somewhat suspect. His familiarity with\nthe arts made his work relevant and accessible to those who engaged in\nthem, and although his early work drew from his knowledge of western\nart, in his later work he also wrote about that found in Asian and\nIndian cultures.\n\nOf the arts, poetry is often singled out in Maritain\u2019s\ndiscussions of beauty and contemplation. Yet Maritain\u2019s\ndefinition of \u2018poetry\u2019 is unique; it is, he writes,\n\u201cthat intercommunication between the inner being things of and\nthe inner being of the human self which is a kind of divination\u201d\n(Creative Intuition, 1953: 3)\u2014though some critics\nremain uncertain of what Maritain means by this. Through poetry, then,\nMaritain held that there can be a contemplation of \u201cthe inner\nbeing of things\u201d and, thereby, of beauty (Trapani 2011: 163).\nThus, there is a close relation between the understanding of being in\nphilosophy, and poetry (see Chenet 2012). \n\nA distinctive feature of Maritain\u2019s discussion of art is his\naccount of what art is. For Maritain, art is \u201ca virtue of the\npractical intellect that aims at making\u201d (Art and\nScholasticism, 1920 [1962: 13]; Creative Intuition,\n1953: 49); it is, then, a virtue that is found in artisans and artists\nalike (see Storck 2010). The virtue or habitus of art,\nMaritain writes, is not simply an \u201cinterior growth of\nspontaneous life\u201d, but has an intellectual character and\ninvolves cultivation and practice. As a characteristic of the\npractical intellect, art is not a speculative or a theoretical\nactivity; it aims not just at knowing, but at doing. Moreover, it can\nbe taught (Trutty-Coohill 2008). Finally, Maritain writes that the\n\u2018making\u2019 at which art aims is something that is demanded\nby the end of the activity itself, not the particular interest of the\nartist.\n\nOn Maritain\u2019s view, what distinguishes the fine arts from the\nwork of artisans is that the fine arts are primarily concerned with\nbeauty\u2014i.e., \u201cthat which upon being seen pleases\u201d\n(Art and Scholasticism, 1920 [1962: 23]; Creative\nIntuition, 1953: 160); this classical view, again adapted from\nAquinas, runs counter to some of the principal trends in aesthetics\nand art since the eighteenth century. Maritain insisted, however, that\nhis view of the place of beauty in art was more consistent with the\npractice of artistic activity. For example, even though a work of art\nis an end in itself, the general end of art is beauty. Thus, since art\nis a virtue that aims at making, to be an artist requires aiming at\nmaking beautiful things (Art and Scholasticism, 1920 [1962:\n33]).\n\nBeauty can be found in nature as well as in art. While beauty affects\nhuman beings through the senses, and while the awareness of beauty\ndoes not involve abstraction (as does knowledge in the sciences),\nnevertheless, beauty is an object of the intellect. Maritain,\nfollowing Aquinas, says that beauty \u201cdelights the\nunderstanding\u201d; the appreciation of art, on the part of the\nspectator, then, involves awakening the intelligence.\n\nArt has both subjective and objective dimensions. The activity of\nartistic creation is clearly something that is carried out by a\nsubject. Moreover, Maritain acknowledges that beauty is\nanalogical\u2014just as \u2018good\u2019 is; just as each thing is\ngood in its own way, so each thing is beautiful in its own way. Still,\nbeauty is not something purely subjective or relative.\nBeauty\u2014and, by extension, art\u2014is something that involves\nintegrity, proportion, and splendour or clarity, which are objective\nqualities. More broadly, art has a relation to the world; it can be a\nresponse to the world, but its expression is also determined by the\nworld and by the work itself. (This also serves to put the ambitions\nand pretensions of the artist into perspective.) Finally, beauty and\nart have a connection to the spiritual and spiritual experience\n(Creative Intuition, 1953: 178). As a creative activity, art\nis ultimately dependent upon (and Maritain says that it is\n\u201cordained to\u201d) the creator and, therefore, its end,\nbeauty, has a relation to the divine and to the transcendentals of\ngoodness, truth, and unity. \n\nA second key feature of Maritain\u2019s views on art is that art is\nrelated to freedom; his views here not only reflect his metaphysics,\nbut bear on his political philosophy. Artistic activity is, for\nMaritain, part of the basic drive in humans to create and make. This\nrequires freedom\u2014and, thus, the artist must be free. Indeed, for\nMaritain, freedom is a fundamental characteristic of the human person.\nBut this freedom is not absolute. Maritain reminds his readers that\nfreedom is not license to do whatever one chooses. Freedom in all its\nforms is ultimately subject to truth and, for the artist, it is also\nsubject to \u201cthe spiritual conditions of honest work\u201d\n(Art and Scholasticism, 1920 [1962: 4]). Maritain would say\nthat artistic activity is analogous to divine free creative activity\n(see his letters to Cocteau); it is \u201cthe highest natural\nresemblance to God\u2019s activity\u201d (Art and Faith,\n1926 [1948: 89]). \n\nWhile Maritain rejects the subordination of the artist to politics and\nto religious authority, he also denies that artists are answerable\nonly to themselves. The creative self, he writes, \u201cdies to\nitself in order to live in [its] work\u201d (Creative\nIntuition, 1953: 144). Moreover, Maritain writes that art\n\u2018perfects\u2019 the artist; that by engaging in this activity\nthere is \u201ca perfecting of the spirit\u201d (Art and\nScholasticism, 1920 [1962: 62]). The freedom that Maritain\nascribes to artists, then, is not a lawless freedom.\n\nA third distinctive feature of Maritain\u2019s philosophy of art is\nhis account of artistic (or what he sometimes calls\n\u2018poetic\u2019) knowledge. Maritain notes the focus on the\nawareness of the self as a characteristic of art from the time of the\nGerman romantics, and he recognises its value so far as it challenges\nthe emphasis by some artists of the 17th century on reason and\nmechanical technique\u2014perhaps having in mind figures such as Paul\nFreart de Chantelou. Artistic knowledge is an instance of what\nMaritain calls, in general, knowledge though connaturality; it is a\nkind of \u2018creative intuition\u2019 that arises out of \u201cthe\nfree creativity of the spirit\u201d (Creative Intuition,\n1953: 112; Natural Law, 2001: 18; see Bellusci 2013, Klein\n2010). Maritain also describes artistic activity as a \u201cgrasping,\nby the poet, of his own subjectivity in order to create\u201d\n(Creative Intuition, 1953: 113). As noted earlier, in the\ndiscussion of Maritain\u2019s epistemology, this knowledge through\nconnaturality is found at the level of the preconscious intellect.\nWhile it is non-conceptual and \u201cobscure\u201d (Creative\nIntuition, 1953: 18; see Natural Law, 2001: 18), it is,\nnevertheless, a knowledge of a \u201cconcrete\nreality\u201d\u2014albeit one that \u201ctends and extends to the\ninfinite\u201d (Creative Intuition, 1953: 126). \n\nMaritain\u2019s views on art had a significant influence on a number\nof artists, writers, and composers of his time, not only on his\ninterlocutors. The American writer, Flannery O\u2019Connor; regarded\nArt and Scholasticism as the book that she \u201ccut [her]\naesthetic teeth on\u201d (O\u2019Connor 1979: 216), and the Canadian\nwriter Morley Callaghan commented that, in the early part of the\ntwentieth century, \u201cChristian artists were finding new dignity\nand spiritual adventure\u201d in Maritain\u2019s work (Callaghan\n1963 [2006: 76]). While no longer central in contemporary debate in\naesthetics, Maritain\u2019s views continue to have a broad audience.\n\n",
