    "main_text": "Pedagogy\n5. Pedagogy\nHerbart writes:\nThe sole and entire task of education\n[Erziehung] is encompassed by the concept,\n\u201cmorality\u201d [Moralit\u00e4t]. (SW I: 259)\n\n If virtue is the realization of human freedom,\nthen the goal of Herbartian education is to make the\nchild capable of living virtuously, viz., by forming the\npupil\u2019s character. For reasons that will become clearer below,\nHerbart identifies moral character with a \u201cmany-sided\u201d\ncharacter. Many-sidedness is a regulative ideal guiding one\u2019s\nstriving towards full individuality: the teacher helps the pupil\ndevelop all his[69]\n unique talents and interests as far and as\ncoherently as possible. That is, the teacher helps the pupil\nsystematically connect his interests around the central principle\nthat is his\n self.[70]\n",
