Batson\u2019s Modified Dictator Game and Moral Hypocrisy\nFor the past twenty years, the psychologist Daniel Batson and his\ncolleagues have developed a novel experimental approach which closely\nresembles the dictator game. Because this approach has been explored\nusing a number of interesting modifications by the same researcher in\nthe course of constructing a sophisticated motivational story about\nresource allocation, and because his findings have attracted a great\ndeal of interest and attention, it is worth delving into them in some\ndetail (For the studies, see Batson et al. 1997, 1999, 2002, 2003. For\nreviews, see Batson and Thompson 2001 and Batson 2008. For related\nstudies and discussion, see Valdesolo and DeSteno 2007, 2008 and\nWatson and Sheikh 2008. For Batson\u2019s exploration of the implications of this research for moral psychology, see Batson 2015.).\nHere is the setup Batson typically used. Participants were told\nthat they were part of a task assignment study. Individually, they\nwere given the choice of whether to assign a positive consequences\ntask or a neutral consequences task to either themselves or another\nparticipant, who (they were told) would simply assume the assignment\nwas made by chance. The positive consequences task was such that for\neach correct response, the participant would receive one ticket for a\nraffle with a prize of $30 at the store of his or her choice. In the\nneutral consequences task, there would be no consequences for correct\nor incorrect responses but, \u201cmost participants assigned to the\nneutral consequences task find it rather dull and boring\u201d\n(Batson et al. 1997: 1339). After making the assignment privately and\nanonymously, participants were asked about what was the morally right\nway to assign the task consequences, and to rate on a 9-point scale\nwhether they thought the way they had actually made the task\nassignment was morally right.\nWe can see that one of the differences between Batson\u2019s setup\nand a typical dictator game is that here the recipient would not know\nwhere the allocation came from, nor that there was another possible\nallocation that could have been made to him instead. Now such\ninformation is not an essential feature of dictator games; in fact we\njust saw a similar setup in one of Dana\u2019s studies. But in the\nusual configuration dictators typically know that recipients will know\nhow they received their allocation.\nWhat ends up happening when participants are placed into this\nsituation? Well, they tend to assign themselves the positive task. Out\nof twenty participants, Batson found (Batson et al. 1997: 1340):\n\nAssigned self to positive consequences task 16\nAssigned other to positive consequences task 4\n\nFurthermore, only 1 out of the 16 said that assigning oneself to\nthe positive task was morally correct. Yet even these 16 participants\nrated the morality of their assignment in the middle of the 9-point\nscale (4.38), which was significantly lower than the 8.25 rating for\nthe 4 participants who assigned the other participant to the positive\nconsequences task (Batson et al. 1997: 1340).\nFrom here Batson performed many additional studies which were\nvariations of this initial setup. Suppose, for instance, that we make\nthe moral norm at work here salient to participants just before they\nmake their assignment by including a statement that,\n Most participants feel that giving both people an\nequal chance\u2014by, for example, flipping a coin\u2014is the\nfairest way to assign themselves and the other participant to the\ntasks (we have provided a coin for you to flip if you wish). But the\ndecision is entirely up to you. (Batson et al. 1997: 1341)\n\n10 participants flipped and 10 did not. 8 out of 10 in the first\ngroup said flipping was the morally right procedure, and 6 out of 10\nsaid so in the second group. Most importantly, Batson found (Batson et\nal. 1997: 1342):\n\n\n\nAssigned self to positive consequences task out of 10 who did not\nflip 9\n\n\nAssigned self to positive consequences task out of 10\nwho did flip 9\n\n\n\nThis second result is grossly out of line with what the random\nflipping of a coin would have predicted. At least some of the\nparticipants in the second group must have flipped in a way that went\nin favor of the other person, but still assigned themselves\nthe positive task. Self-interest seemed to have crept into their\ndecision making process in a significant way. Yet, and perhaps most\nsurprisingly, those who flipped rated what they had done much more\nmorally right (7.30 on a 1\u20139 scale) than those who did not flip\n(4.00) (Batson et al. 1997: 1341).\nHere is another wrinkle\u2014suppose participants are now given\nthe option to have the experimenter assign them one of the two tasks,\nwhile also knowing what that assignment is going to be ahead of\ntime. We get the following (Batson et al. 1997: 1343):\n\n\n\nAccepted experimenter\u2019s assignment\nif it would be the positive consequences task\n17 out of 20\n\n\nAccepted experimenter\u2019s assignment if it would be the\nneutral consequences task \n11 out of 20\n\nRemaining participants who assigned themselves to the positive\nconsequences task (whether flipped or not) \n12 out of 12\n\n\n\nSo in this experiment, only 22.5% of participants ended up with the\nneutral task. Yet for the 17 participants in the first group, on\naverage they felt they had acted just as morally right (7.06 on a\n9-point scale) as the 11 participants in the second group (7.91)\n(Batson et al. 1997: 1343).\nWhat these results have suggested to Batson is that most of us (at\nleast in these kinds of situations) are disposed towards a kind\nof moral hypocrisy, or appearing to be moral to oneself and\nothers but avoiding the costs of actually being so if one can (try to)\nget away with it. After all, many participants were typically eager to\nflip the coin and report after the fact that this was the morally\nright course of action, but then distorted the process so that the\nresults came out in their favor. Note that it is not the mere fact\nthat they choose the positive consequences task for themselves that is\nhypocritical by itself\u2014there could be cases where a person\nthinks of acts like this as being in line with her self-interest, and\nis not even aware of their moral ramifications. Nor is their hypocrisy\ncaptured here by the additional fact that the participants also seemed\nto believe in the moral principle that flipping the coin is the\nmorally fair way to assign the task consequences. For then we would\njust have a perfectly familiar case of weakness of will, in which you\nbelieve that something is right but fail to be sufficiently motivated\nto do it.  Rather, their hypocrisy arises when they (i) choose the\npositive consequences for themselves, while (ii) seeming to believe\nthat flipping the coin and following what it indicates is morally\ncorrect, and (iii) still claiming to themselves and others to\nhave made the morally right task assignment (For more on\ncharacterizing moral hypocrisy, see Batson et al. 1997:\n1335\u20131336, 1999: 525\u2013526, 2002: 330; Batson and Thompson\n2001; and Batson 2008, 2011: 222\u2013224.).\nHow is it really possible for these participants to pull off this\ncombination? In particular, it is one thing to appear to be acting\nmorally to others. But these participants are also appearing to be\nmoral to themselves too. How are they able\nto downplay the costs associated with guilt, regret, and hypocritical\nbehavior for acting immorally by going against what they know to be\nright, and also experience the self-rewards for moral behavior? One\npossibility is that the participants in question have come to deny any\nmoral responsibility in this situation, thereby deactivating the moral\nnorm. Or perhaps they have come to deny that they are able to carry\nout the task, or that they are no longer aware of the likely\nconsequences of their actions. But there is no evidence to suggest\nthat these background conditions have failed to apply in these\nparticular cases (Batson 2008: 57). Another possibility is that these\nparticipants have come to think that their behavior is in line with\ntheir moral standards, thereby allowing them to not feel guilt and to\neven perhaps take pride in their behavior. This could be because they\nhave revised the content of the moral principle to create an exception\nclause for this one kind of situation. Or it might be that they lie to\nor deceive themselves about what the principle says in the first\nplace.\nBut the results already cited above cast doubt on these hypotheses\nas well (see in particular Batson et al. 1999: 526; this is not to say\nthat these hypotheses are not accurate in other cases, but the focus\nhere is only on understanding the data generated by Batson\u2019s\nstudies). Batson also introduced another variety of the setup whereby\nthe moral principle is made salient, a coin is provided, and the coin\nis clearly marked on one side with \u201cSELF to POS[ITIVE]\u201d\nand \u201cOTHER to POS\u201d for the opposite side (Batson et\nal. 1999: 527). In those cases when the coin lands on OTHER, it seems\nvery hard to think, in spite of what the moral principle and the coin\nboth say, that a person who still assigns himself to the positive\nconsequences task would take that to be morally\nacceptable. Furthermore, only 2 out of 40 participants reported\nafterwards that the most morally right thing to do is to assign\nthemselves to the positive consequences task (Batson et al. 1999:\n529). Yet of the 28 who chose to flip, Batson found (Batson et\nal. 1999: 528):\n\n\n\nAssigned self to positive consequences task\n24\n\n\nAssigned other to positive consequences task\n4\n\n\n\nFurthermore, those who assigned themselves to the positive\nconsequences task after flipping the coin again thought that they were\nbeing highly moral (7.42 on a 9-point scale), while those who made the\nsame assignment without flipping the coin did not (3.90) (Batson et\nal.  1999: 529). So marking the coin and thereby reducing the\nambiguity as to what the fair assignment should have been, did nothing\nto undermine moral hypocrisy. We are still without an explanation for\nhow it seems to work\u2014more on that in a moment.\nA natural thought here is that this last result does not\ndistinguish between those participants who flip, win, and then rate\nthe morality of their action, versus those who flip, lose, change the\ntask assignment to favor themselves, and then rate the morality of\ntheir action. It could be that the former group (rightly) rates the\nmorality of their action highly, since they are following the fair\nprocedure, whereas the second group rates it low, perhaps around 4.0\nas do those who do not even bother flipping the coin and just assign\nthemselves the positive task. If the results came out this way, then\nwe would have evidence for moral weakness of will, to be sure, but not\nfor moral hypocrisy, since the second group would be honest about the\nmoral failure of their action.\nIn a later study, Batson tested this possibility using secret\nobservations of how each participant who flipped ended up having his\nor her coin fall (Batson et al. 2002: 334\u2013338). Of the 32 who\nflipped the coin, 16 got OTHER to POS or otherwise fiddled the coin\nflip so that it came out in their favor (i.e., repeated flipping). For\nthis group, the mean rated morality of their action was 5.56, which\nwas significantly higher than the 3.89 for the group which assigned\nitself to the positive task without using the coin. On the other hand,\nit was also lower than the 7.45 for the group which flipped, won SELF\nto POS, and assigned themselves to the positive task (2002: 336). The\nupshot is that,\n even though the coin had no more effect on their\ndecision than it had on the decision of those who did not claim to use\nthe coin at all, the fiddlers still said they thought the way they\nmade the task assignment decision was more moral. Their sham reference\nto use of the coin seems to have provided sufficient appearance of\nmorality that they could claim to have acted, if not totally morally,\nat least moderately so. (2002: 337)\nTo summarize, the studies mentioned above suggest that participants\ncould have had their relevant fairness norm activated\u2014in this\ncase, the norm that flipping a coin and conforming to its results is\nthe morally right way to behave\u2014and even be motivated to some\nextent to do so. But this motivation must have been so weak that, once\nthe cost/benefit analysis was done on an alternative action of\nsecretly ignoring the coin when it went against the person and instead\nassigning oneself to the positive task, it became fairly easy to\noutweigh or undercut the motivation to do the right thing. So our\nfairness norms look to have little enhancing power after all, or at\nleast in these kinds of cases.\nBut all is not lost for fairness norms. Batson was able to discover\ntwo variables which separately helped to ensure that motivation to be\nfair did win out. The first variable was the introduction of a\nmirror. The setup was as usual with no labeling of the coin, but now a\nmirror was propped up against a wall on the only table where\nparticipants could fill out their forms. For one group of\nparticipants, the mirror was facing them; for the other, it was turned\nto the wall. This ended up making a significant difference (Batson et\nal. 1999: 530):\n\n Assigned Self to Positive Consequences Task \n  No Facing Mirror Facing Mirror\n Did Not Flip Coin (29) 85% 62%\n Flipped Coin (23)  85% 50%\n\nHere for the first time we see results in line with what fairness\nrequires\u2014for those who flipped the coin and were facing the\nmirror, the overall results were as chance would predict.\nWhat is the best explanation for the contribution made by the\nmirror?  Batson appeals to research on the psychology of\nself-awareness, in which objects like mirrors can,\n heighten awareness of discrepancies between\nbehavior and salient personal standards, creating pressure to act in\naccord with standards. (Batson et al. 1999: 529; for more on the\npsychology of self-awareness, see Wicklund 1975)\n In this case, the mirror served to highlight to the person the\ndifference between what he believed was morally correct in this\nsituation, and the opposing temptation to act out of self-interest.\nThis heightened awareness seemed to either create extra motivation to\ncomply with the fairness norm or lessen motivation to do the\nself-interested thing (or perhaps both). Thus the mirror can be said\nto increase the salience of the self\u2019s own personal standards of\nevaluation (Another hypothesis, though, is that it increases the\nsalience of standards of social evaluation, i.e., how others might\njudge him. Batson tested this possibility and did not find support for\nit (2002: 331\u2013334)).\nSelf-awareness also provides a clue about where to find a plausible\nexplanation for how moral hypocrisy is possible. That clue has to do\nwith a particular form of self-deception (Batson et al. 1997: 1336,\n1346, 1999: 526\u2013527.). Rather than thinking that participants\nsimply revised their fairness standards to make their behavior look\nacceptable in their own eyes, perhaps instead they were engaging\n(often unconsciously) in an act of self-deception whereby they avoided\ncomparing their behavior to the relevant moral standards. If the two\nare kept apart from each other, that mitigates the perceived costs of\nnot acting fairly while doing nothing to mitigate the perceived\nbenefits of acting self-interestedly. But with increased\nself-awareness, the discrepancy between the fairness norm and the\nself-interested option was made especially salient so that it became\npsychologically difficult for many participants to employ this\nparticular form of self-deception (Batson et al. 1999: 527, 529,\n531\u2013532, 2002: 331 and Batson and Thompson 2001: 55.).\nThe other variable which Batson found to increase motivation\nassociated with the fairness norms had to do with perspective\ntaking. Take the usual setup, but with the caveat that the default\nstarting point is for the participant to be awarded two raffle tickets\nfor every correct response, while the other participant gets zero\ntickets. Then the task assignment becomes whether the participant is\nwilling to change the assignment so that it is symmetrical with both\npeople receiving one ticket each. For controls, 38% changed the task\nconsequences to symmetrical. However, for the experimental group, 83%\ndid (Batson et al. 2003: 1199). The difference? This group was\ninstructed to adopt the perspective of the other\nperson\u2014\u201cwe would like for you to imagine yourself in the\nplace of the other participant\u201d (Batson et al. 2003: 1198,\nemphasis deleted). This is different from imagining what the other\nperson is feeling or experiencing\u2014the instructions here are very\nmuch in line with the Biblical mandate to, \u201cDo unto others as\nyou would have them do unto you\u201d (Matthew 7:12.).\nThere is one additional implication from Batson\u2019s work which\nI want to highlight here. Consider again those participants who are\nabout to flip the coin. At that point before they see what the outcome\nis, what is the nature of their motivation? Perhaps for the moment at\nleast some of them want to do the morally right thing (follow the\ndictate of the coin, however it ends up landing) for its own sake. If\nthe coin lands in their favor, then the outcome also aligns with their\nself-interest, which is so much the better. But if it lands in the\nother person\u2019s favor, then they might see what being fair would\ncost them, and their self-interested motives end up outweighing their\ninitial moral motivation. Or perhaps this is all\nfanciful\u2014perhaps when they are flipping the coin, all they want\nis what they think is ultimately in their self-interest, which at the\nmoment is just flipping the coin so as to benefit from appearing to be\nmoral.\nOne way to test these hypotheses, Batson reasoned, is to see if\nparticipants cared about whether the flipping of the coin and so the\ntask assignment was done by themselves or by the experimenter. If the\negoistic hypothesis is correct, then they should want to flip the coin\nthemselves so that they can rig the outcome. If the other hypothesis\ninvolving an ultimate desire to be moral is correct, however, it\nshould not matter who flips. When the experiment was actually run with\nthis choice option, 80% of those who used a coin wanted the\nexperimenter to flip it. This initial evidence thus favors postulating\na motive to follow the fairness norm (and perhaps moral norms more\ngenerally) for its own sake (Batson and Thompson 2001:\n55\u201356.).\nSuppose this hypothesis about motivation is correct. How strong and\npsychologically powerful of a force does it typically seem to be in\ncases involving fairness? The evidence suggests, at least given the\ncurrent state of research, that for many of us it is only weak in\nstrength. We can already see this from the studies cited above when so\nmany participants do not actually follow their moral principle about\nwhat is a fair task assignment. In addition, Batson varied the\nprevious setup so that the assignment was between a positive and\na negative task, where the latter involved receiving\n\u201cmild but uncomfortable\u201d electric shocks for each\nincorrect response.  With this change, only 25% of participants\noffered to let the experimenter flip the coin, and another 25% flipped\nthemselves, with 91% choosing the positive task. The remaining 50% of\nparticipants simply bypassed the pretense of the coin flip and gave\nthemselves the positive task while readily admitting that this was not\nmorally right (Batson and Thompson 2001: 56.). The implication is that\nmoral motivation caused by our fairness norms seems to be weak and\nhighly susceptible to being outweighed in cases of this type where the\nperson\u2019s self-interest is at stake.\n",
