Motivational internalists believe\nthat there is some sort of conceptual or necessary connection between\nmoral judgments on the one hand and motivations to act on the other.\nThe nature of the connection is a matter of some dispute and theorists\nhave suggested and refuted a variety of candidates (Hare 1952, 20;\nBrink 1989, 37ff.; Smith 1994, 60ff; Darwall 1997). Non-cognitivists\nhave often supported their theory by arguing from versions of judgment\ninternalism, which postulate a necessary connection between accepting\na moral judgment on the one hand and being motivated to act on it on\nthe other (Stevenson 1937; Hare 1952; Blackburn 1998; Gibbard 1990).\nThis sort of internalism is controversial, so that leading\nnon-cognitivists have had both to defend judgment internalism and to\nargue that their favored theory should be accepted as the best\nexplanation of the sort of internalism they attempt to vindicate.\n\nYou can find defenses of various versions of judgment internalism\nwhich support somewhat different but still necessary connections\nbetween accepting or uttering a moral judgment on the one hand and\nbeing motivated on the other. One version makes the connection very\ntight \u2013 if one accepts a judgment one is motivated to do what it\nsays we ought to do. Others are looser, requiring motivation only in\nrational persons (Korsgaard 1986; Smith 1994, 61) or perhaps in normal\nmembers of a community (Dreier 1990; Horgan & Timmons 1992;\n164\u20135). Depending on which version a theorist defends, different\nversions of non-cognitivism can explain the necessity of the\nconnection, although not all versions can be easily explained using\nnon-cognitivist resources. The tightest connection which requires\nmotivation in anyone who accepts the judgment that some action is\nright is rather well explained by a very simple version of emotivism\non which a judgment that some action is right conventionally expresses\none\u2019s approval of that action. One can only sincerely use that\nexpression when one has the attitude just as one can only sincerely\ncheer for some team or person if one has a positive attitude towards\nthem. Sincere utterance requires motivation, that\u2019s part and\nparcel of this sort of emotivist theory.\n\nOn the other hand, this easy explanation of the strong internalist\nthesis has liabilities. Such strong internalism may be too strong to\nbe credible insofar as it rules out amoralists \u2013 those who\naccept moral judgments without being at all motivated to do what they\nrecommend. Such people may be possible and even actual (Brink 1989,\n46; Svavarsd\u00f3ttir 1999). If so, simple emotivism of the sort\ndescribed is refuted because the sincerity conditions for making the\njudgment require the motivation not present in the amoralist. Examples\nsuch as the amoralist have led internalists to posit more moderate,\ndefeasible, but still necessary connections between moral judgments\nand motivation (Korsgaard 1986; Dreier 1990; Smith 1994). More complex\nversions of non-cognitivism can make the connection with actual\nmotivation looser and thereby withstand the amoralist challenge. But\nnot every more moderate internalist principle will be easily explained\nby a corresponding non-cognitivist theory. Some versions of moderate\ninternalism require that rational people will be motivated in\naccordance with their own moral judgments (Smith 1994, 61). It\nisn\u2019t clear what version of non-cognitivism can take advantage\nof this sort of defeasible connection. On any theory where the\nacceptance of a moral judgment is constituted by the acceptance of a\nnon-cognitive attitude, it should be the case that those who genuinely\nhold the judgment have the attitude. This should apply to the\nirrational as well as the rational.\n\nOther responses to the amoralist are available consistent with\nnon-cognitivism. One such response is not to accept a defeasible\nversion of internalism, but rather to claim that amoralists do not\nhave genuine moral beliefs. What an amoralist expresses when she makes\na moral claim that she is disinclined to honor involves using the\nmoral predicate in an \u201cinverted commas sense\u201d \u2013 a\nsense which alludes to the value judgments of others without itself\nexpressing such a judgment (Hare 1952, 145\u20136). Many cognitivists\nhave not found this a persuasive characterization of all amoralists\n(Brink 1989, 46\u20137). Alternatively, non-cognitivists can point\nout that a sentence can conventionally express an attitude even when\nuttered by people who don\u2019t have the requisite attitude. For\nexample, one can apologize without feeling sorry or actually caring\nabout what is at issue (Joyce 2002). But it is not so easy to see how\nto carry this over to the treatment of accepting a moral judgment in\nthe absence of uttering a moral sentence. We would like there to be\ngrounds to attribute the belief or acceptance of a moral judgment to\nthose who are silent on some grounds, and it isn\u2019t clear exactly\nwhat resources are available to a non-cognitivist if it doesn\u2019t\ninvolve being in some attitudinal state. Even if one can sincerely\napologize without having any special feeling or attitude as one does\nso, it seems we would not say of a person that they were sorry unless\nthey had such an attitude. Thus the analogy with apology only takes us\nso far.\n\nHare\u2019s most famous argument for the action-guiding character of\nmoral judgments is the Missionaries and the Cannibals Argument. He\nsuggests an example in which our translation practices seem to\nindicate that when we use moral words from our home language to\ntranslate words and concepts from another language, what is most\nimportant to us is that native users of the language or concepts\ngenerally use them to guide choice and action (Hare 1952,\n148\u20139). If this is right, it establishes a connection of the\nfollowing form: Necessarily the acceptance of a moral judgment will\nnormally incline society members to do what is recommended by that\njudgment. This version will require an intention to act or something\nsimilar in most people much of the time, but it will not require such\nan intention from everybody all of the time. The argument thus\nsupports a version of moderate internalism. And, according to Hare,\npeople who utter general commands that are directed at themselves will\nnormally but not invariably act in accordance with those commands\n(Hare 1952, 169). So this much of prescriptivism fits with the sort of\ninternalism that Hare\u2019s arguments support. But, insofar as Hare\nalso suggests that accepting a command directed at oneself requires an\nintention to act accordingly (Hare 1952, 20), he seems committed to a\ncloser connection between moral judgment and motivating states than\nthe Missionaries and Cannibals Argument vindicates.\n\nThus far we have been considering internalism as a reason to accept\nnon-cognitivism based on a sort of inference to the best explanation.\nInsofar as non-cognitivism can explain the connection between\nnormative or moral judgments and motivation we have some reason to\naccept it. But the explanations so far have relied on the positive\npart of non-cognitivism \u2013 the part that connects the meanings of\nmoral terms to commendation or the expression of attitudes. The denial\nof cognitivism so far has played no role. Since the expressivist or\nprescriptivist component of non-cognitivist theories does not by\nitself entail the denial of cognitivism, a cognitivist could take them\non board and explain a species of internalism just as non-cognitivists\ndo (Copp 2001).\n\nThere is, however, a popular non-cognitivist strategy for arguing that\nthey are uniquely placed to explain judgment internalism. This\nstrategy proceeds from the Humean idea that belief alone is incapable\nof motivating action. The Humean Theory of Motivation, as it has come\nto be known, postulates that motives must always be composed of\ndesires for some end, possibly along with some relevant means-ends\nbelief (Hume 1888, 413; Smith 1987). The theory is supposed to rule\nout any state of mind which both qualifies as a cognitive state and\nwhich would be sufficient to motivate action by itself without\nsupplementation from some independent desire. If moral judgments\nnecessarily motivate, even in the absence of further desires, the\ntheory seems to entail that they cannot be genuine beliefs. They must\nbe conative rather than cognitive states, or at the very least be\ncomposites to which the non-cognitive component is essential. Even if\nbeliefs are also constituents of the judgment, those beliefs will not\nbe identical to it, since they can persist in the absence of\nmotivation while the moral judgments necessitate motives (Blackburn\n1998, 97\u2013100).\n\nThis argument too can be resisted by cognitivists. It presupposes a\nparticularly strong version of internalism. If the nature of the\nnecessary connection between moral judgments and motives is of a\ndefeasible kind, it will be possible for someone to accept the\njudgment while remaining unmotivated (Korsgaard 1986; Dreier 1990;\nSmith 1994). And even a stronger version of judgment internalism might\nbe consistent with various subjectivist cognitivist theories,\nespecially those which relativize the truth of moral judgments to\nindividual agents. Such theories can make the truth conditions for the\njudgments include the presence of certain attitudes in the speaker and\nclaim that speakers are highly accurate in tracking that part of their\ntruth conditions (Harman 1978; Dreier 1990.). Furthermore, despite its\nlofty pedigree, the Humean Theory of Motivation is itself subject to\ndispute (Bromwich 2010; Dancy 1996; Darwall 1983; Nagel 1970; McDowell\n1981; Swartzer 2013, 2018; van Roojen 1995, 2002).\n",
