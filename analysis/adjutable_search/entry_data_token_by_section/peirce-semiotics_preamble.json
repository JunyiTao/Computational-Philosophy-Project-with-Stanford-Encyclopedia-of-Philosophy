    "main_text": "\n\nPeirce\u2019s Sign Theory, or Semiotic, is an account of signification,\nrepresentation, reference and meaning. Although sign theories have a\nlong history, Peirce\u2019s accounts are distinctive and innovative for\ntheir breadth and complexity, and for capturing the importance of\ninterpretation to signification. For Peirce, developing a\nthoroughgoing theory of signs was a central philosophical and\nintellectual preoccupation. The importance of semiotic for Peirce is\nwide ranging. As he himself said, \u201c[\u2026] it has never been\nin my power to study anything, \u2013 mathematics, ethics, metaphysics,\ngravitation, thermodynamics, optics, chemistry, comparative anatomy,\nastronomy, psychology, phonetics, economics, the history of science,\nwhist, men and women, wine, metrology, except as a study of\nsemiotic\u201d (SS 1977, 85\u20136). Peirce also treated sign theory\nas central to his work on logic, as the medium for inquiry and the\nprocess of scientific discovery, and even as one possible means for\n\u2018proving\u2019 his pragmatism. Its importance in Peirce\u2019s philosophy, then,\ncannot be overestimated.\n\nAcross the course of his intellectual life, Peirce continually\nreturned to and developed his ideas about signs and semiotic and there\nare three broadly delineable accounts: a concise Early Account from\nthe 1860s; a complete and relatively neat Interim Account developed\nthrough the 1880s and 1890s and presented in 1903; and his\nspeculative, rambling, and incomplete Final Account developed between\n1906 and 1910. The following entry examines these three accounts, and\ntraces the changes that led Peirce to develop earlier accounts and\ngenerate new, more complex, sign theories. However, despite these\nchanges, Peirce\u2019s ideas on the basic structure of signs and\nsignification remain largely uniform throughout his developments.\nConsequently, it is useful to begin with an account of the basic\nstructure of signs according to Peirce.\n",
