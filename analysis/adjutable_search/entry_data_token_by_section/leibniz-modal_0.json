Individuals and Worlds\n\n\nIn order to explain Leibniz's modal metaphysics\u2014the metaphysics\nof necessity, contingency, and possibility\u2014we must look first at\nthe foundation of Leibniz's system more generally: his conception of\nan individual substance. In \u00a78 of the Discourse on\nMetaphysics, Leibniz presents his classic picture, writing:\nThe nature of an individual substance or of a complete being is\nto have a notion so complete that it is sufficient to contain and to\nallow us to deduce from it all the predicates of the subject to which\nthis notion is attributed. (A VI iv 1540/AG 41)\nIn other words, each individual substance has a complete\nindividual concept (CIC), which contains (or from which are\ndeducible) all predicates true of it past, present, and\nfuture. Leibniz asks his reader to consider the case of Alexander the\nGreat. On his view, God can, as it were, look at the complete\nindividual concept of Alexander and see that he conquered Darius and\nPorus, that he was the student of Aristotle, that his armies would\nmarch into India, and so on. For our purposes, it will suffice to\nthink of the CIC as the essence of an individual substance and to\nthink of God as able to survey all essences of all individual\nsubstances. (The issue is, in fact, vexed; for insightful\npresentations of views rivaling that presented here, see Sleigh 1990\nor Cover and Hawthorne 1999.)  Further, according to Leibniz, one of\nthe consequences of this view of the nature of an individual substance\nis that no two substances can be qualitatively identical and differ\nnumerically.  In other words, the Principle of the Identity of\nIndiscernibles (PII) follows from this conception of the nature of\nsubstance, and PII entails that, for any possible world, there is at\nmost one instance of a CIC.\n\n\nIndividual substances, of course, are parts of, or rather, members of a\nworld. In other words, a world is a set of individual\nsubstances; or, as Leibniz puts in the opening line of On the\nUltimate Origination of Things, a world is a \u201ccollection of\nfinite things.\u201d (G VII 302/AG 149) More specifically,\nLeibniz tells Bourguet, \u201cthe universe is only a certain kind of\ncollection of compossibles; and the actual universe is the collection\nof all possible existents, that is, of those things that form the\nrichest composite.\u201d (G III 573) In saying that a world is a\nset of compossible things, however, Leibniz is saying that a world is a\nkind of collection of things that God could bring into\nexistence. For not even God can bring into existence a world in\nwhich there is some contradiction among its members or their\nproperties. But this opens up the question: Just what is meant by\na contradiction in the case of the members of a world?\n\n\nLet us say that two or more substances are compossible if and only\nif there is no contradiction between the predicates derivable from\ntheir CICs. For example, consider the two individuals, Don and\nRon. One of Don's properties is being the tallest man\n(at time t); one of Ron's properties is also being the\ntallest man (at time t). Naturally, Don and Ron cannot then\ninhabit the same world. On the other hand, each could have the\nproperty being over 2 meters tall and be members of the same\nworld. Now in Leibniz's fully developed metaphysics this\nexample might not be considered a good one, since it is most likely the\ncase that Leibnizian individuals are not to be thought of as\nconstituted by such relational properties. Rather than thinking\nof compossibility in terms of the properties of substances, it might be\neasier to think of it in terms of the perceptions of substances.\nCertainly, Don and Ron cannot be said to be members of the same world\nif Don perceives the moon landing of Apollo 11 on July 20, 1969 and Ron\ndoes not (or would not)\u2014and not simply because he does not have\na television set, but because on his July 20, 1969, there is\nno United States of America, let alone a space program. From\nthis, it should also be clear that the compossibility of substances in\na world is another manifestation of Leibniz's thesis of the\nuniversal harmony of perceptions of substances.\n\n\nA possible world, however, is not simply a set of compossible\nindividuals. According to Leibniz, a possible world also entails\ncertain laws of nature. As Leibniz says to Arnauld in a letter\nfrom 14 July 1686,\n\nI think there is an infinity of possible ways in which to create the\nworld, according to the different designs which God could form, and\nthat each possible world depends on certain principal designs or\npurposes of God which are distinctive of it, that is, certain primary\nfree decrees (conceived sub ratione possibilitatis) or certain\nlaws of the general order of this possible universe\nwith which they are in accord and whose concept they determine, as they\ndo also the concepts of all the individual substances which must enter\ninto this same universe. (G II 51/L 333)\n\n\nLeibniz's basic idea here should conform closely with our\nintuitions. Imagine God's considering a set of\nindividuals {a, b, c, d}. From God's point of view\nhe could choose to actualize this world with one set, L*, of\nlaws of nature or with another set of laws, L**. And\nthis choice represents a choice between two possible worlds. This\nis similar to our saying that we would have a different world\nif the gravitational constant were different. Now, this way of\nspeaking is not exactly right, for on Leibniz's view, the\ndifferent sets of laws would ultimately produce different properties\nand perceptions with the individual substances. As a result, the\nindividuals in the worlds governed by L* and L**\nwould strictly speaking be different.\n\n\nThe reason Leibniz mentions the different laws governing the different\npossible worlds is that the systems of laws and their effects serve as\ncriteria by which God chooses a world. We know that, for Leibniz,\nGod chooses the \u201cbest of all possible worlds.\u201d In\n\u00a76 the Discourse on Metaphysics, however, we learn that\nthis means that God chooses the world that is simplest in hypotheses\n(or laws) and richest in phenomena. Thus, while one might be\ntempted to see natural laws as derivative of the actual properties and\nperceptions of individual substances, in fact they are objects of\nGod's choice.\n\n\nWhen Leibniz speaks of a possible world, he means a set of\ncompossible, finite things that God could have brought into\nexistence if he were not constrained by the goodness that is\npart of his nature. The actual world, on the other hand, is\nsimply that set of finite things that is instantiated by God, because\nit is greatest in goodness, reality and perfection. Naturally, the\nfact that we are here experiencing this world \u2013 the actual\nworld \u2013 means that there is at least one possible world. So are\nthere others?\n\n\nYes, indeed, there are. At least Leibniz thinks so. In his view, as we\nsaw above, there are an infinite number of possible worlds \u2013\nworlds that God did not see fit to bring into existence. Now, given\nthat Leibniz's safe claim is that \u201c[t]here are as many possible\nworlds as there are series of things that can be conceived that do not\nimply a contradiction,\u201d (Grua 390) it might still be the case\nthat there is only one possible world \u2013 only one set of\nessences that implies no contradiction. If we accept the claim that a\npossible world is simply any set of compossible individuals (i.e. a\nset of individuals whose properties or perceptions do not contradict\neach other), then there is a rather trivial way to show that there are\nan infinite number of possible worlds. Namely, we just have an\ninfinity of one-object worlds: thus w1 contains a\nblue, 8lb.  bowling ball; w2, a red, 10lb. bowling\nball; w3, a pepperoni\npizza; w4, a bicycle; and so on. We could even\nimagine worlds with two, three, or more objects.\n\n\nNow, Leibniz's reasons for proposing an infinity of possible worlds\nare somewhat different. In his short essay On Contingency\n(De contingentia, 1689?), Leibniz makes the following\nclaim:\n\n\nOne must certainly hold that not all possibles attain existence,\notherwise one could imagine no novel that did not exist in some place\nand at some time. Indeed, it does not seem possible for all\npossible things to exist, since they get in one another's\nway. There are, in fact, an infinite number of series of possible\nthings. Moreover, one series certainly cannot be contained within\nanother, since each and every one of them is complete. (A VI iv 1651/AG\n29)\n\n\nThe point here is that there are unactualized possibles as\nexemplified in works of fiction. In other words, a work of fiction\nrepresents some way the world could be. (To be precise, works\nof fiction represent partial ways worlds could be since they\ndo not (and cannot) depict complete or total\nworlds. For example, was Lincoln shot in the world described\nby Moby-Dick? We don't know.)  But, insofar as these\npossibles conflict among themselves, it is clear that not all\npossibles are compossible. Rather, as we saw above, sets of\ncompossible individuals are Leibniz's possible worlds.  If we add to\nthis picture the idea that each individual has a complete individual\nconcept \u2013 that is, a determinate concept \u2013 which is\nsufficient to distinguish it from every other possible world, then we\nsee that possible individuals are tied to determinate possible\nworlds.\n\n\nBut what is the character of these non-actualized possibles?\nThe most natural assumption is that they are like individual substances\nas characterized by Leibniz in Discourse on Metaphysics\n\u00a78, that is, as having complete individual concepts. In\nother words, all individuals (actual or merely possible) have\ndeterminate essences. In the case of merely possible individuals,\nhowever, their being is contained solely in the divine mind.\nConsider Leibniz's claim in the Theodicy \u00a7189:\n\u201cIn the region of the eternal verities are found all the\npossibles.\u201d (G VI 229/H 246) And, in \u00a744 of the\nMonadology, in the middle of his argument for God's\nnecessary existence, Leibniz says, \u201cif there is reality in\nessences or possibles, or indeed, in eternal truths, this reality must\nbe grounded in something existent and actual, and consequently, it must\nbe grounded in the existence of the necessary being, in whom essence\ninvolves existence, that is, in whom possible being is sufficient for\nactual being.\u201d (G VI 614/AG 218) In other words, there will\nbe determinate essences of some substances that are actualized in the\nworld as well as determinate essences of substances that exist solely\nin the divine intellect.\n\n\nBy way of contrast, Spinoza argues in the Ethics (Ip33) that\nthere are no unactualized possibles. In the case of a story\ndepicting another \u201creality,\u201d we have only partial and\nconfused knowledge of the world depicted. If we were to\nhave true knowledge of the way all the characters and their actions\nextend backward and forward in time, we could ultimately arrive at some\ncontradiction. Moreover, Spinoza holds that everything that is\ntruly possible will be expressed at some point as God or nature\nexpresses its infinite essence. That is, since God is a substance\nof infinite attributes expressed in infinite ways, everything that is\npossible finds existence at some point in this\nworld. Of course, this difference between Leibniz and Spinoza is\nlargely attributable to Leibniz's adherence to what Spinoza finds\nso wrong: the anthropomorphic conception of God and the attendant\ndistinction between divine intellect and will, which is what allows for\nGod's supposed contemplation of non-existent possibles.\n\n\nIn Meaning and Necessity, Rudolf Carnap suggests that a\nLeibnizian possible world is represented by his\nstate-descriptions: a class of sentences containing, for\nevery atomic sentence, either it or its negation. In other words, for\neach possible world there is a series of propositions that will fully\ndescribe that world. The idea of a possible world as being such a set\nof sentences or propositions leads naturally to the notion of a\n\u201cworld-book,\u201d a term employed by Alvin Plantinga\n(The Nature of Necessity). Lest such devices seem\nanachronistic, it should be pointed out that, in the fascinating\nconclusion to the Theodicy, Leibniz speaks in a similar way;\nindeed, Leibniz's parable is something that one might imagine has come\nstraight from Jorge Luis Borges (cf. \u201cThe Library of\nBabel\u201d). The story concerns Theodorus, a high priest present\nwhen Sextus Tarquinius complains to Jupiter about his fate.  (Sextus\nwas the son of the last king of Rome, whose crime of raping Lucretia\nso incensed Brutus that he led a revolt that ultimately abolished the\nmonarchy and began the Roman Republic.) Theodorus is moved by Sextus'\ncomplaint and is sent to receive instruction at the temple of Pallas\nAthena where he is shown \u201cthe palace of the fates.\u201d\nAccording to Athena, \u201cHere are representations not only of that\nwhich happens but also of all that which is possible. Jupiter, having\nsurveyed them before the beginning of the existing world, classified\nthe possibilities into worlds, and chose the best of all.\u201d\n(Theodicy \u00a7414: G VI 363/H 370) She continues,\n\n\nI have only to speak, and we shall see a whole world that my father\nmight have produced, wherein will be represented anything that can be\nasked of him; and in this way one may know also what would happen if\nany particular possibility should attain unto existence. And\nwhenever the conditions are not determinate enough, there will be as\nmany such worlds differing from one another as one shall wish, which\nwill answer differently the same question, in as many ways as\npossible\u2026 But if you put a case that differs from the actual\nworld only in one single definite thing and in its results, a certain\none of those determinate worlds will answer you. These worlds are\nall here, that is, in ideas. I will show you some, wherein shall\nbe found, not absolutely the same Sextus as you have seen (that is not\npossible, he carries with him always that which he shall be) but\nseveral Sextuses resembling him, possessing all that is already in him\nimperceptibly, nor in consequence all that shall yet happen to\nhim\u2026 (Theodicy \u00a7414: G VI 363/H 370\u201371)\n\n\nTheodorus is led into one of the halls of the palace and, observing\na great volume of writings in the hall, asks what it is.\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Athena tells him, \u201cthe history of this world\nwhich we are now visiting\u2026; it is the book of fates.\u201d\n(Theodicy \u00a7415: G VI 363/H 371\u201372) And, finally, we\nhave an argument for the infinity of worlds wrapped in a fantasy\ntale:\n\n\nThe halls rose in a pyramid, becoming even more beautiful as one\nmounted towards the apex, and representing more beautiful worlds.\nFinally they reached the highest one which completed the pyramid, and\nwhich was the most beautiful of all: for the pyramid had a beginning,\nbut one could not see its end; it had an apex, but no base; it went on\nincreasing to infinity. That is (as the Goddess explained)\nbecause amongst an endless number of possible worlds there is the best\nof all, else would God not have determined to create any; but there is\nnot any one which has not also less perfect worlds below it: that is\nwhy the pyramid goes on descending to infinity. (Theodicy\n\u00a7416: G VI 364/H 372)\n\n\nLeibniz makes clear here his basic view of God's\nobligation to choose the best world possible, as well as his\nview that, if there were not a single best world, no world at all\nwould have been brought into existence. At the same time, the argument\nfor the infinity of possible worlds given here is rather comical:\n(granted, there must be one best world) for any world you can imagine\n(or find in the pyramid), there is one that is worse.  So much for\nLeibniz the optimist! \n\n\nThe world-books are on permanent display in the divine intellect.\nThis is what Leibniz means when he says that they reside in the realm\nof eternal verities. But one thing should be absolutely clear:\nLeibniz is no modal realist \u00e0 la David Lewis. Although\nLeibniz claims that there are an infinity of possible worlds,\nhe does not mean that infinitely many possible worlds exist in the same\nway as this (actual) world does, or that infinitely many worlds are\nrunning, as it were, parallel to this one, or that \u201cactual\u201d\nis an indexical expression like \u201chere\u201d and \u201cnow.\u201d\nThe existence claim commits Leibniz only to the existence of different ways\nthe world could be and to the shelving of these world-books in the\ninfinite and eternal library of the divine mind. As he puts it in\nthe same letter to Arnauld, \u201cthere is no other reality in pure\npossibles than the reality they have in the divine\nunderstanding.\u201d (G II 45/AG 75) But it is crucial to\nLeibniz's position that there be one and only one actual\nworld, the best of all possible worlds. As we have seen, God is\nobligated to bring this one world into existence. And,\nwe have also seen that, according to Leibniz, if there were no uniquely\nbest world, then God would not have brought any world into\nexistence. (And God could not simply play Eenee, Meenee,\nMainee, Mo! with two worlds; he must, according to the Principle\nof Sufficient Reason, have a ground for his decision.) Further,\nthere cannot be two worlds that are absolutely equal in terms of their\ndegrees of perfection, for God, by virtue of his omnipotence and\nomniscience, must be able to determine some distinction\nbetween the worlds. And if God had actualized more than one world\nand they had been of different degrees of perfection, then God would\nhave brought into existence that which is less perfect than possible (a\nviolation of the requirements of divine benevolence). (Concerning\nthe reasons for this world, more below.)\n",
