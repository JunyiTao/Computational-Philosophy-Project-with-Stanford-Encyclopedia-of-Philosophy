Precursors\n\nThe philosophical modernism at issue in postmodernism begins with\nKant's \u201cCopernican revolution,\u201d that is, his assumption\nthat we cannot know things in themselves and that objects of knowledge\nmust conform to our faculties of representation (Kant 1787).  Ideas\nsuch as God, freedom, immortality, the world, first beginning, and\nfinal end have only a regulative function for knowledge, since they\ncannot find fulfilling instances among objects of experience. With\nHegel, the immediacy of the subject-object relation itself is shown to\nbe illusory. As he states in The Phenomenology of Spirit,\n\u201cwe find that neither the one nor the other is\nonly immediately present in sense-certainty, but each is at\nthe same time mediated\u201d (Hegel 1807, 59), because\nsubject and object are both instances of a \u201cthis\u201d and a\n\u201cnow,\u201d neither of which are immediately sensed. So-called\nimmediate perception therefore lacks the certainty of immediacy\nitself, a certainty that must be deferred to the working out of a\ncomplete system of experience.  However, later thinkers point out that\nHegel's logic pre-supposes concepts, such as identity and negation\n(see Hegel 1812), which cannot themselves be accepted as immediately\ngiven, and which therefore must be accounted for in some other,\nnon-dialectical way. \n\nThe later nineteenth century is the age of modernity as an achieved\nreality, where science and technology, including networks of mass\ncommunication and transportation, reshape human perceptions. There is\nno clear distinction, then, between the natural and the artificial in\nexperience. Indeed, many proponents of postmodernism challenge the\nviability of such a distinction tout court, seeing in\nachieved modernism the emergence of a problem the philosophical\ntradition has repressed. A consequence of achieved modernism is what\npostmodernists might refer to as de-realization. De-realization\naffects both the subject and the objects of experience, such that\ntheir sense of identity, constancy, and substance is upset or\ndissolved. Important precursors to this notion are found in\nKierkegaard, Marx and Nietzsche. Kierkegaard, for example, describes\nmodern society as a network of relations in which individuals are\nleveled into an abstract phantom known as \u201cthe public\u201d\n(Kierkegaard 1846, 59). The modern public, in contrast to ancient and\nmedieval communities, is a creation of the press, which is the only\ninstrument capable of holding together the mass of unreal individuals\n\u201cwho never are and never can be united in an actual situation or\norganization\u201d (Kierkegaard 1846, 60). In this sense, society has\nbecome a realization of abstract thought, held together by an\nartificial and all-pervasive medium speaking for everyone and for no\none. In Marx, on the other hand, we have an analysis of the fetishism\nof commodities (Marx 1867, 444\u2013461) where objects lose the\nsolidity of their use value and become spectral figures under the\naspect of exchange value. Their ghostly nature results from their\nabsorption into a network of social relations, where their values\nfluctuate independently of their corporeal being. Human subjects\nthemselves experience this de-realization because commodities are\nproducts of their labor. Workers paradoxically lose their being in\nrealizing themselves, and this becomes emblematic for those professing\na postmodern sensibility.\n\nWe also find suggestions of de-realization in Nietzsche, who speaks of\nbeing as \u201cthe last breath of a vaporizing reality\u201d and\nremarks upon the dissolution of the distinction between the\n\u201creal\u201d and the \u201capparent\u201d\nworld. In Twilight of the Idols, he traces the history of\nthis distinction from Plato to his own time, where the \u201ctrue\nworld\u201d becomes a useless and superfluous idea (1889,\n485\u201386). However, with the notion of the true world, he says, we\nhave also done away with the apparent one. What is left is neither\nreal nor apparent, but something in between, and therefore something\nakin to the virtual reality of more recent vintage.\n\nThe notion of a collapse between the real and the apparent is\nsuggested in Nietzsche's first book, The Birth of Tragedy\n(Nietzsche 1872), where he presents Greek tragedy as a synthesis of\nnatural art impulses represented by the gods Apollo and\nDionysus. Where Apollo is the god of beautiful forms and images,\nDionysus is the god of frenzy and intoxication, under whose sway the\nspell of individuated existence is broken in a moment of\nundifferentiated oneness with nature. While tragic art is\nlife-affirming in joining these two impulses, logic and science are\nbuilt upon Apollonian representations that have become frozen and\nlifeless. Hence, Nietzsche believes only a return of the Dionysian art\nimpulse can save modern society from sterility and nihilism. This\ninterpretation presages postmodern concepts of art and representation,\nand also anticipates postmodernists' fascination with the prospect of\na revolutionary moment auguring a new, anarchic sense of\ncommunity.\n\nNietzsche is also a precursor for postmodernism in his genealogical\nanalyses of fundamental concepts, especially what he takes to be the\ncore concept of Western metaphysics, the \u201cI\u201d. On\nNietzsche's account, the concept of the \u201cI\u201d arises out of\na moral imperative to be responsible for our actions. In order to be\nresponsible we must assume that we are the cause of our actions, and\nthis cause must hold over time, retaining its identity, so that\nrewards and punishments are accepted as consequences for actions\ndeemed beneficial or detrimental to others (Nietzsche 1889, 482-83;\n1887, 24-26, 58-60). In this way, the concept of the \u201cI\u201d\ncomes about as a social construction and moral illusion. According to\nNietzsche, the moral sense of the \u201cI\u201d as an identical\ncause is projected onto events in the world, where the identity of\nthings, causes, effects, etc., takes shape in easily communicable\nrepresentations. Thus logic is born from the demand to adhere to\ncommon social norms which shape the human herd into a society of\nknowing and acting subjects.\n\nFor postmodernists, Nietzsche's genealogy of concepts in \u201cOn\nTruth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense\u201d (Nietzsche 1873,\n77\u201397) is also an important reference. In this text, Nietzsche\nputs forward the hypothesis that scientific concepts are chains of\nmetaphors hardened into accepted truths. On this account, metaphor\nbegins when a nerve stimulus is copied as an image, which is then\nimitated in sound, giving rise, when repeated, to the word, which\nbecomes a concept when the word is used to designate multiple\ninstances of singular events. Conceptual metaphors are thus lies\nbecause they equate unequal things, just as the chain of metaphors\nmoves from one level to another. Hegel's problem with the repetition\nof the \u201cthis\u201d and the \u201cnow\u201d is thus expanded\nto include the repetition of instances across discontinuous gaps\nbetween kinds and levels of things.\n\nIn close connection with this genealogy, Nietzsche criticizes the\nhistoricism of the nineteenth century in the 1874 essay, \u201cOn\nthe Uses and Disadvantage of History for Life\u201d (Nietzsche 1874,\n57\u2013123). On Nietzsche's view, the life of an individual and a\nculture depend upon their ability to repeat an unhistorical moment, a\nkind of forgetfulness, along with their continuous development\nthrough time, and the study of history ought therefore to emphasize\nhow each person or culture attains and repeats this moment. There is\nno question, then, of reaching a standpoint outside of history or of\nconceiving past times as stages on the way to the present. Historical\nrepetition is not linear, but each age worthy of its designation\nrepeats the unhistorical moment that is its own present as\n\u201cnew.\u201d In this respect, Nietzsche would agree with\nCharles Baudelaire, who describes modernity as \u201cthe transient,\nthe fleeting, the contingent\u201d that is repeated in all ages\n(Cahoone 2003, 100), and postmodernists read Nietzsche's remarks on\nthe eternal return accordingly.\n\nNietzsche presents this concept in The Gay Science\n(Nietzsche 1974 [1882], 273), and in a more developed form\nin Thus Spoke Zarathustra (Nietzsche 1883\u20131891,\n269\u2013272). Many have taken the concept to imply an endless,\nidentical repetition of everything in the universe, such that nothing\noccurs that has not already occurred an infinite number of times\nbefore. However, others, including postmodernists, read these\npassages in conjunction with the notion that history is the\nrepetition of an unhistorical moment, a moment that is always new in\neach case. In their view, Nietzsche can only mean that the new\neternally repeats as new, and therefore recurrence is a matter of\ndifference rather than identity. Furthermore, postmodernists join the\nconcept of eternal return with the loss of the distinction between\nthe real and the apparent world. The distinction itself does not\nreappear, and what repeats is neither real nor apparent in the\ntraditional sense, but is a phantasm or simulacrum. \n\nNietzsche is a common interest between postmodern philosophers and\nMartin Heidegger, whose meditations on art, technology, and the\nwithdrawal of being they regularly cite and comment upon. Heidegger's\ncontribution to the sense of de-realization of the world stems from\noft repeated remarks such as: \u201cEverywhere we are underway amid\nbeings, and yet we no longer know how it stands with being\u201d\n(Heidegger 2000 [1953], 217), and \u201cprecisely nowhere does\nman today any longer encounter himself, i.e., his essence\u201d\n(Heidegger 1993, 332). Heidegger sees modern technology as the\nfulfillment of Western metaphysics, which he characterizes as the\nmetaphysics of presence. From the time of the earliest philosophers,\nbut definitively with Plato, says Heidegger, Western thought has\nconceived of being as the presence of beings, which in the modern\nworld has come to mean the availability of beings for use. In fact,\nas he writes in Being and Time, the presence of beings tends\nto disappear into the transparency of their usefulness as things\nready-to-hand (Heidegger 1962 [1927], 95-107). The essence of\ntechnology, which he names \u201cthe enframing,\u201d reduces the\nbeing of entities to a calculative order (Heidegger 1993,\n311-341). Hence, the mountain is not a mountain but a standing supply\nof coal, the Rhine is not the Rhine but an engine for hydro-electric\nenergy, and humans are not humans but reserves of manpower. The\nexperience of the modern world, then, is the experience of being's\nwithdrawal in face of the enframing and its sway over\nbeings. However, humans are affected by this withdrawal in moments of\nanxiety or boredom, and therein lies the way to a possible return of\nbeing, which would be tantamount to a repetition of the experience of\nbeing opened up by Parmenides and Heraclitus.\n\nHeidegger sees this as the realization of the will to power, another\nNietzschean conception, which, conjoined with the eternal return,\nrepresents the exhaustion of the metaphysical tradition (Heidegger\n1991a, 199-203). For Heidegger, the will to power is the eternal\nrecurrence as becoming, and the permanence of becoming is the\nterminal moment of the metaphysics of presence. On this reading,\nbecoming is the emerging and passing away of beings within and among\nother beings instead of an emergence from being. Thus, for Heidegger,\nNietzsche marks the end of metaphysical thinking but not a passage\nbeyond it, and therefore Heidegger sees him as the last metaphysician\nin whom the oblivion of being is complete (Heidegger 1991a, 204-206;\n1991b, 199-203). Hope for a passage into non-metaphysical thinking\nlies rather with H\u00f6lderlin, whose verses give voice to signs\ngranted by being in its withdrawal (Heidegger 1994 [1937\u20131938],\n115-118). While postmodernists owe much to Heidegger's reflections on\nthe non-presence of being and the de-realization of beings through\nthe technological enframing, they sharply diverge from his reading of\nNietzsche.\n\nMany postmodern philosophers find in Heidegger a nostalgia for being\nthey do not share.  They prefer, instead, the sense of cheerful\nforgetting and playful creativity in Nietzsche's eternal return as a\nrepetition of the different and the new. Some have gone so far as to\nturn the tables on Heidegger, and to read his ruminations on\nmetaphysics as the repetition of an original metaphysical gesture,\nthe gathering of thought to its \u201cproper\u201d essence and\nvocation (see Derrida 1989 [1987]). In this gathering, which follows\nthe lineaments of an exclusively Greco-Christian-German tradition,\nsomething more original than being is forgotten, and that is the\ndifference and alterity against which, and with which, the tradition\ncomposes itself.  Prominent authors associated with postmodernism\nhave noted that the forgotten and excluded \u201cother\u201d of the\nWest, including Heidegger, is figured by the Jew (see Lyotard 1990\n[1988], and Lacoue-Labarthe 1990 [1988]). In this way, they are able\nto distinguish their projects from Heidegger's thinking and to\ncritically account for his involvement with National Socialism and\nhis silence about the Holocaust, albeit in terms that do not address\nthese as personal failings. Those looking for personal condemnations\nof Heidegger for his actions and his \u201crefusal to accept\nresponsibility\u201d will not find them in postmodernist\ncommentaries. They will, however, find many departures from Heidegger\non Nietzsche's philosophical significance (see Derrida 1979 [1978]),\nand many instances where Nietzsche's ideas are critically activated\nagainst Heidegger and his self-presentation.\n Nevertheless, Heidegger and Nietzsche are both important sources\nfor postmodernism's critical de-structuring or displacement of the\nsignature concept of modern philosophy, the \u201csubject,\u201d\nwhich is generally understood as consciousness, or its identity,\nground, or unity, and designated as the \u201cI.\u201d Where\nNietzsche finds in this concept the original metaphysical error\nproduced by morality and the communicative needs of the herd,\nHeidegger sees in it the end and exhaustion of the metaphysical\ntradition, inaugurated by the Greeks, in which being is interpreted as\npresence.  Here, being is the underlying ground of the being of\nbeings, the subiectum that is enacted in modern philosophy as\nthe subject of consciousness.  But in Being and Time Heidegger\nconceives the human being as Dasein, which is not simply a\npresent consciousness, but an event of ecstatic temporality that is\nopen to a past (Gewesensein) that was never present\n(its already being-there) and a future (Zu-kunft) that\nis always yet to come (the possibility of death).  The finitude\nof Dasein therefore cannot be contained within the limits of\nconsciousness, nor within the limits of the subject, whether it is\nconceived substantively or formally.\nIn addition to the critiques of the subject offered by Nietzsche\nand Heidegger, many postmodernists also borrow heavily from the\npsycho-analytic theories of Jacques Lacan.  Lacan's distinctive\ngesture is his insistence that the Freudian unconscious is a function,\nor set of functions, belonging to language and particularly to the\nverbal exchanges between the analyst and analysand during the analytic\nsession (see Lacan 1953\u201355).  For Lacan, the subject is always the\nsubject of speech, and that means speech directed toward\nan other in relation to whom the subject differentiates and\nidentifies itself.  On this view, language is a feature of the\n\u201csymbolic order\u201d of society, which is constituted as an\neconomy of signifiers, through which animal need becomes human desire,\nwhose first object is to be recognized by the other.  However, desire\nultimately aims for something impossible: to possess, to\n\u201cbe,\u201d or to occupy the place of the signifier of\nsignifiers, i.e. the phallus.  Insofar as the phallus is nothing but\nthe signifying function as such, it does not exist.  It is not\nan object to be possessed, but is that through which the subject and\nthe other are brought into relation to begin with, and it thus imposes\nitself upon the subject as a fundamental absence or lack that is at\nonce necessary and irremediable (Lacan 1977, 289).  Hence the subject\nis forever divided from itself and unable to achieve final unity or\nidentity.  As the subject of desire, it remains perpetually\nincomplete, just as Dasein in Heidegger exists \u201cbeyond\nitself\u201d in temporal ecstasis.\n",
