    "main_text": "Emanative Causation and the Problem of the Eternity of the World\n6. Emanative Causation and the Problem of the Eternity of the World\n\nTaurellus\u2019s conception of a separation between God and creatures\nwith respect to substance is challenged not only by Cesalpino\u2019s\nversion of a theory of a unique intellect but also by theories of\nemanation prominent in early modern Platonism. This is why in\nCosmology (1603 [KOS]) and On the Eternity of Things\n(1604 [DRA]) Taurellus discusses Piccolomini\u2019s views on\nemanative causation (see Blank 2009). Like Taurellus, Piccolomini\nraises numerous objections against thinking about the relation between\nGod and the world in terms of emanative causation. However, Taurellus\ncriticizes Piccolomini on two levels: he thinks that many of\nPiccolomini\u2019s arguments are flawed in matters of detail and,\nhence, do not lend support to the desired conclusion; and he\nreproaches Piccolomini for conceding too much to the\nPlatonists\u2014such as the view that elementary forces derive from\nthe agency of a Platonic world soul. No doubt, Taurellus\u2019s books\nwere highly informative for his contemporaries in that they show how a\ntheory of emanative causation might work. However, understanding the\nrelation between God and the world as an emanation relation turns out\nto be incompatible with his own view of the subsistence independence\nof elements.\n\nIn Taurellus\u2019s view, several arguments provide reasons against\nunderstanding subsistence dependence of created beings in terms of\nformal emanation. Taurellus holds that elements possess forms and\nforces that are independent of any continued divine agency. That he\nascribes formal properties to elements that are independent of a\ncontinuous conserving activity of God becomes clear, where he\ndiscusses Piccolomini\u2019s claim that every part of the world\ndepends on God (Piccolomini 1596b: bk. II, ch. 2). Taurellus points\nout that Piccolomini derives this claim from Marsilio Ficino, who held\nthat corporeal mass cannot exist on its own since otherwise it would\nform itself (see Ficino 2001\u20132006: vol. 1, 18\u201327). As\nFicino and Piccolomini argue, conveying form onto a corporeal\nsubstance is not a property of body since all active beings act by\nmeans of some incorporeal faculty.\n\nFicino and Piccolomini conclude that the world depends in all its\nparts on an incorporeal principle of agency in such a way that, since\nit depends always on this principle, it can be said to be created\ncontinually (DRA: 448\u2013449). Taurellus agrees that bodily mass\ncannot convey form onto itself. However, he does not believe that\nbodily mass, once it is formed, requires any external active\nprinciple to preserve its form (DRA: 449). Likewise, he holds that\nelements have their own forces\u2014forces that are derived from the\nelements, not from any being external to them. In his view, the\nheavens not only do not have the force to convey form to elements,\nthey are also unnecessary to explain the forces that elements possess.\nTaurellus takes issue with Piccolomini\u2019s claim that God imparts\nforces on things in the world by means of a Platonic world soul (see\nPiccolomini 1596a: ch. 30). Contrary to Piccolomini, Taurellus holds\nthat in addition to general forces that influence all bodies on earth\nin a uniform way, there are specific forces that belong to the\nelements (DRA: 275).\n\nTaurellus develops some further considerations against understanding\nsubsistence dependence in terms of the emanation of the essences of\nnatural beings from the essence of God. Suppose that the heavens are\npreserved by means of continuous creation or by means of a perpetual\nefflux of divine essence. In this case, Taurellus argues,\nHeraclitus\u2019 view of the perpetual flux of all things would be\nconfirmed since nothing would remain intact beyond the duration of a\nmoment. If emanation is thought of as a \u201cflow\u201d of essence,\nas much essence as is conveyed to a particular object at a given\nmoment has to be previously withdrawn from its source (KOS:\n235\u2013236). In this way, emanation of essence implies the constant\nchange both of created things and their source. Taurellus argues that\nsuch a conception of the mutability of all created things is contrary\nto the Aristotelian conception of the regular and stable motions of\nthe stars\u2014motions which become inexplicable once one assumes\nthat stars are unstable and momentary objects. The same holds,\naccording to him, for the fixed and stable figure of stars (KOS:\n236).\n\nTaurellus discusses two ways in which something \u201cflows\u201d\nfrom one being to another: the \u201cflowing\u201d of substance, and\nthe \u201cflowing\u201d of accidents (KOS: 238). According to the\nlate scholastic concepts of accident and substance shared by Taurellus\n(see, e.g., AC: 48\u201349), accidents are entities that inhere in\nanother being, while substances are entities that do not inhere in\nanother being. If a new accident of a substance is produced by this\nsubstance, we have an instance of immanent causation: a causal\nrelation within one and the same being. If a substance produces a new\naccident, one could plausibly assume that such a causal relation does\nnot diminish the substance from which the new accident arises, because\nit is an effect that inheres in it. Taurellus holds that this is the\nonly conceivable conception of how something can to be said\n\u201cin\u201d God: divine attributes \u201ccomplete\u201d the\ndivine essence (DRA: 458). But he maintains that such a conception of\nthe \u201cflowing\u201d of accidents is of no help when it comes to\nanalyze the relation between God and natural beings. As he argues, due\nto the self-sufficiency of elements, elements are the true subjects of\ninherence of their accidents. Hence, they belong to the category of\nsubstance, not to the category of accidents. Therefore, also a world\ncomposed of elements does not belong to the category of accidents\n(KOS: 62\u201363). Consequently, a world composed of elements cannot\ninhere in the divine substance (KOS: 238; DRA: 459).\n",
