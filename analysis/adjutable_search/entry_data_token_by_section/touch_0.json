    "main_text": "Background and Terminology\n1. Background and Terminology\nTouch is a fundamental form of non\u2013visual perception, one\nthat plays a crucial role in nearly all of our sensory experiences (a\nfeature noted by Gibson 1966). It is, unlike many of the other senses,\nmore plausibly taken to be inherently multisensory, given the\ndiversity of its constituent systems and forms of experience. In\naddition, it seems to have unique and philosophically interesting\nconnections to exploratory action and bodily awareness.\nBefore turning to these issues, it will be helpful to provide some\nbackground on the terminology typically used to talk about\ntouch. These are standard terms used in both philosophy and cognitive\nscience, and they are (for the most part) neutral ways of talking\nabout the diverse constituents involved in typical touch\nexperiences.\nWhat we typically refer to as \u201cthe sense of touch\u201d is\nwhat we will call \u201cactive\u201d or \u201chaptic\u201d\ntouch. This refers to touch that involves some movement. This movement\ncan be voluntary, exploratory movements of the hands and other sensory\nsurfaces involved in touch, or it can also refer to experiences\ngenerated by objects moving against a stationary body. In most cases,\nhaptic touch will involve the engagement of kinesthesis (awareness of\nmovement) and proprioception (awareness of bodily position). Some\napply the term \u201chaptic\u201d for any touch that involves the\nactivation of (the physiologically and functionally distinct)\nkinesthetic or proprioceptive systems (e.g., Loomis and Lederman\n1986). Touch mediated entirely through the skin will be referred to as\n\u201ccutaneous touch\u201d. The term \u201ctactual\u201d will be\nused as a broad term to refer to any form of touch experience (so\nit\u2019s used in the same way that \u201cauditory\u201d and\n\u201colfactory\u201d are used for hearing and smell ). For the\nfeatures and objects made available through touch the term\n\u201ctangible\u201d will be used (again, in the same way as\n\u201cvisible\u201d is used for for features and objects made\navailable by vision).\n",
