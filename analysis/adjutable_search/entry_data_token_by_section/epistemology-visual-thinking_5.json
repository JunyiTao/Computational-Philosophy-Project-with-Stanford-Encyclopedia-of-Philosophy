    "main_text": "Visual thinking and proof || A dispute: diagrams in proofs in analysis.\n3.3 A dispute: diagrams in proofs in analysis.\nWhere notions involving the infinite are in play, such as many\ninvolving limits, the use of diagrams is famously risky. For this\nreason it has been widely thought that, beyond some very simple cases,\narguments in real and complex analysis in which diagrams have a\nnon-superfluous role are not genuine proofs. Bolzano [1817] expressed\nthis attitude with regard to the intermediate value theorem for the\nreal numbers (IVT) before giving a purely analytic proof, arguing that\nspatial thinking could not be used to help justify the IVT. James\nRobert Brown (1999) takes issue with Bolzano on this point.  The IVT\nis this:\nIf \\(f\\) is a real-valued function of a real variable continuous on the closed interval \\([a, b]\\) and \\(f(a) < c < f(b)\\), then for some \\(x\\) in \\((a, b), f(x) = c\\).\nBrown focuses on the special case when \\(c = 0\\). As the IVT can be\ndeduced easily from this special case using the theorem that the\ndifference of two continuous functions is continuous, there is no loss\nof generality here. Alluding to a diagram like Figure 5, Brown (1999)\nwrites\n\n We have a continuous line running from below to above\nthe \\(x\\)-axis. Clearly, it must cross that axis in doing\nso. (1999: 26) \n Later he claims: \n\n Using the picture alone, we can be certain of this result\u2014if\nwe can be certain of anything. (1999: 28) \n\n\nFigure 5\n\nBolzano\u2019s diagram-free proof of the IVT is an argument from\nwhat later became known as the Dedekind completeness of the real\nnumbers: every non-empty set of reals bounded above (below) has a\nleast upper bound (greatest lower bound). The value of Bolzano\u2019s\ndeduction of the IVT from the Dedekind completeness of the reals,\naccording to Brown, is not that it proves the IVT but that it gives us\nconfirmation of Dedekind completeness, just as an empirical hypothesis\nin empirical science gets confirmed by deducing some consequence of\nthe hypothesis and observing those consequence to be true. This view\nassumes that we already know the IVT to be true by observing a diagram\nrelevantly like Figure 5.\nThat assumption is challenged by Giaquinto (2011). Once we\ndistinguish graphical concepts from associated analytic concepts, the\nunderlying argument from the diagram is essentially this.\n\n1. Any function \\(f\\) which is \\(\\varepsilon\\textrm{-}\\delta\\) continuous on \\([a, b]\\) with \\(f (a) < 0 < f (b)\\) has a visually continuous graphical curve from below the horizontal line representing the \\(x\\)-axis to above.\n2.  Any visually continuous graphical curve from below a horizontal line to above it meets the line at a crossing point.\n3.  Any function whose graphical curve meets the line representing the \\(x\\)-axis at a crossing point has a zero value.\n4.  So, any \\(\\varepsilon\\textrm{-}\\delta\\) continuous function \\(f\\) on \\([a, b]\\) with \\(f (a) < 0< f (b)\\) has a zero value.\n\nWhat is inferred from the diagram is premiss 2. Premisses 1 and 3\nare assumptions linking analytical with graphical conditions. These\nlinking assumptions are disputed. With regard to premiss 1 Giaquinto\n(2011) argues that there are functions on the reals which meet the\nantecedent condition but do not have graphical curves, such as\ncontinuous but nowhere differentiable functions and functions which\noscillate with unbounded frequency e.g., \\(f(x) = x \\cdot\\sin(1/x)\\)\nfor non-zero \\(x\\) in \\([-1, 1]\\) and \\(f(0) = 0\\).\nWith regard to premiss 3 it is argued that, under the standard\nconventions of graphical representation of functions in a Cartesian\nco-ordinate frame, the graphical curve for \\(x^2 - 2\\) in the\nrationals is the same as the graphical curve for \\(x^2- 2\\) in the\nreals. This is because every real is a limit point of rationals; so\nfor every point \\(P\\) with one or both co-ordinates irrational, there\nare points arbitrarily close to \\(P\\) with both co-ordinates rational;\nso no gaps would appear if irrational points were removed from the\ncurve for \\(x^2- 2\\) in the reals. But for \\(x\\) in the rational\ninterval [0, 2] the function \\(x^2- 2\\) has no zero value, even though\nit has a graphical curve which visually crosses the line representing\nthe \\(x\\)-axis. So one cannot read off the existence of a zero of\n\\(x^2- 2\\) on the reals from the diagram; one needs to appeal to some\nproperty of the reals which the rationals lack, such as Dedekind\ncompleteness.\nThis raises some obvious questions. Do any theorems of\nanalysis have proofs in which diagrams have a non-superfluous role?\nLittlewood (1953: 54\u20135) thought so and gives an example which is\nexamined in Giaquinto (1994). If so, can we demarcate this class of\ntheorems by some mathematical feature of their content? Another\nquestion is whether there is a significantly broad class of functions\non the reals for which we could prove an intermediate value theorem\n(i.e., restricted to that class).\nIf there are theorems of analysis provable with diagrams we do not\nyet have a mathematical demarcation criterion for them. A natural\nplace to look would be O-minimal structures on the reals\u2014this\nwas brought to the author\u2019s attention by Ethan Galebach. This is\nbecause of some remarkable theorems about such structures which\nexclude all the pathological (hence vision-defying) functions on the\nreals (Van den Dries 1998), such as continuous nowhere differentiable\nfunctions and \u201cspace-filling\u201d curves i.e., continuous\nsurjections \\(f:(0, 1)\\rightarrow(0, 1)^2\\). Is the IVT for functions\nin an O-minimal structure on the reals provable by visual means?\nCertainly one objection to the visual argument for the unrestricted\nIVT does not apply when the restriction is in place. This is the\nobjection that continuous nowhere differentiable functions, having no\ngraphical curve, provide counterexamples to the premiss that any\n\\(\\varepsilon\\textrm{-}\\delta\\) continuous function \\(f\\) on \\([a,\nb]\\) with \\(f (a) < c < f (b)\\) has a visually continuous\ngraphical curve from below the horizontal line representing \\(y = c\\)\nto above.  But the existence of continuous functions with no graphical\ncurve is not the only objection to the visual argument, contrary to a\nclaim of Azzouni (2013: 327). There are also counterexamples to the\npremiss that any function that does have a graphical curve\nwhich visibly crosses the line representing \\(y = c\\) takes \\(c\\) as a\nvalue, e.g., the function \\(x^2 - 2\\) on the rationals with \\(c =\n0\\). So the question of a visual proof of the IVT restricted to\nfunctions in an O-minimal structure on the reals is still open at the\ntime of writing.\n",
