    "main_text": "Political Thought || Realizing Rule by Virtue in Democracy\n6. Recent Developments\n\nModern Confucian philosophy is of course not limited to these four\nscholars, nor did its development stop with the twentieth century. Mou\nZongsan and Tang Junyi in particular were instrumental in training the\nfollowing generations of Chinese philosophers in Taiwan and Hong Kong,\nwhere their thought remains very influential. When mainland China\nbegan opening in the 1980s, scholars there initiated major projects on\nthe study of modern Confucianism. New editions of their works were\npublished, including those who had lived outside of China (usually\nexcising their criticisms of the Communist Party). Scholarly exchanges\nbetween Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China also picked up, with the result\nthat these once-separate scholarly communities are now intertwined,\nwith some mainland scholars now developing their own modern Confucian\nphilosophies (sometimes explicitly in opposition to Mou, Tang, and Xu)\n(Chen 2006 [2009]; Li Zehou 2015 [2018]; Y. Li 2021).\n\nThe fundamentals of modern Confucianism can be found in these other\nphilosophers: interest in modernity and what it means for China, and\ninfluence from Western philosophy, in vocabulary or ideas or both. Any\nChinese philosopher in East Asia now has to know Western philosophy as\nwell as Chinese, and comparisons are everywhere. For the most part,\nthe influence goes in one direction still. East Asian philosophers\nknow Western philosophy much better than Western philosophers know any\nAsian philosophy. Fortunately, some translations have become available\nrecently, and with luck this will continue. Modern Confucian\nphilosophers believed they had something important to offer the world,\nand their views are beginning to get some interest outside of East\nAsia.\n",
