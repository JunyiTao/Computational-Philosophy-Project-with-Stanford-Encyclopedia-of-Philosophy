    "main_text": "The Emergence of Ecological Rationality\n3. The Emergence of Ecological Rationality\n\nImagine a meadow whose plants are loaded with insects but few are in\nflight. Then, this meadow is a more favorable environment for a bird\nthat gleans rather than hawks. In a similar fashion, a decision-making\nenvironment might be more favorable for one decision-making strategy\nthan for another. Just as it would be \u201cirrational\u201d for a\nbird to hawk rather than glean, given the choice for this meadow, so\ntoo what may be an irrational decision strategy in one environment may\nbe entirely rational in another.\n\nIf procedural rationality attaches a cost to the making of a decision,\nthen ecological rationality locates that procedure in the world. The\nquestions ecological rationality ask are what features of an\nenvironment can help or hinder decision making and how should we model\njudgment or decision-making ecologies. For example, people make causal\ninferences about patterns of covariation they observe\u2014especially\nchildren, who then perform experiments testing their causal hypotheses\n(Glymour 2001). Unsurprisingly, people who draw the correct inferences\nabout the true causal model do better than those who infer the wrong\ncausal model (Meder, Mayrhofer, & Waldmann 2014). More surprising,\nMeder and his colleagues found that those making correct causal\njudgments do better than subjects who make no causal judgments at all.\nAnd perhaps most surprising of all is that those with true causal\nknowledge also beat the benchmark standards in the literature which\nignore causal structure entirely; the benchmarks encode, spuriously,\nthe assumption that the best we can do is to make no causal judgments\nat all.\n\nIn this section and the next we will cover five important\ncontributions to the emergence of ecological rationality. In this\nsection, after reviewing Simon\u2019s proposal for distinguishing\nbetween behavioral constraints and environmental\nstructure, we turn to three historically important contributions:\nthe lens model, rational analysis, and cultural\nadaptation. Finally, in\n section 4,\n we review the bias-variance decomposition, which has figured\nin the Fast and Frugal Heuristics literature\n (section 7.2).\n",
