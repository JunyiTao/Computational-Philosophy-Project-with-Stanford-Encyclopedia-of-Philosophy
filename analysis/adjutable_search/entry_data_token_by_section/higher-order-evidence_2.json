    "main_text": "Denying the Import of Higher-Order Evidence || Structural problems for higher-order evidence\n2.1 Structural problems for higher-order evidence\n\nLasonen-Aarnio begins with the observation that respecting\nhigher-order evidence can compel a rational agent to violate genuine\nepistemic rules. (This is very similar to the idea presented in the\nintroduction: that after Aisha receives her higher-order evidence, her\ntotal evidence still supports G.) Since this thought\nis common to much of the higher-order evidence literature, it will be\nworth spelling out in detail the reasoning behind it. One simple way\nto make the thought plausible is to focus on a case of\nentailment\u2014so, let\u2019s suppose Aisha\u2019s first-order\nevidence entails G. Then we can argue as follows:\n\nP1.\nAisha\u2019s first-order evidence entails G.\nP2.\nAfter Aisha receives her higher-order evidence, her total evidence\nentails G.\nP3.\nIt is a rational requirement to believe what our evidence\nentails.\nP4.\nAfter Aisha receives her higher-order evidence, she is rationally\nrequired to believe G.\nP5.\nAfter Aisha receives her higher-order evidence, she is rationally\nrequired to suspend judgment on G.\nC.\nAfter receiving her higher-order evidence, Aisha is rationally\nrequired to violate a rational requirement.\n\n\nP1\n is built into (this version of) our case.\n P2\n follows from\n P1,\n assuming that Aisha\u2019s body of total evidence grows\nmonotonically over the course of the story.\n P3\n is plausible, and would nicely explain our verdict at the beginning\nof the story: that, before she receives her higher-order evidence,\nAisha should believe G.\n P4\n follows from\n P2\n and\n P3.\n And\n P5\n is the intuitive verdict that many epistemologists share about cases\nlike Hypoxia. (Though see Henderson forthcoming, Staffel forthcoming,\nand Steglich-Peterson 2019 for alternative views on which higher-order\nevidence does not require suspension of judgment, but still has a\nrational effect.) So if\n P5\n is right, this means that Aisha is required to disobey an epistemic\nrule which applies to her current situation: she must suspend judgment\nin a proposition that is entailed by her evidence, rather than believe\nit.\n\nThough focusing on entailment makes the argument above particularly\nclear, it\u2019s not essential. The same problem can, plausibly,\narise with non-entailing evidence as well. Lasonen-Aarnio focuses on a\nperceptual case, and Christensen (2010a) argues that cases involving\ninductive reasoning can lead to the same conclusion. (Both argue for\nversions of\n P2\n in non-entailing contexts: they argue, respectively, that the\nperceptual or inductive support remains even in the face of\nhigher-order undermining.)\n\nHow can we make sense of Aisha\u2019s situation, in light of this\napparent conflict? Lasonen-Aarnio (2014) surveys several possible ways\nto make room for the conflict within our overall epistemological\ntheory. One strategy we might try is to say that epistemic rules have\nbuilt-in exceptions for higher-order defeat. That doesn\u2019t solve\nthe problem, Lasonen-Aarnio argues, but just pushes it back: if any\nrule can be defeated, then so can rules with built-in exceptions. A\nsecond strategy is to say that epistemic rules are hierarchical, with\nsome taking precedence over others; but again, the higher-level rules\nmust themselves be defeasible, leading to an infinite hierarchy. The\nrules must also be ordered by a \u201cmeta-rule\u201d which\ndetermines which rule governs one\u2019s current situation; what if\nthe meta-rule itself is defeasible? It seems that we are either left\nwith an infinite regress, or that we must accept a stopping\npoint\u2014a rule which itself cannot be rationally defeated. Another\nstrategy is to posit an \u201c\u00dcber-rule\u201d which specifies\nthe rational response for each unique situation. This fails,\nLasonen-Aarnio argues, because it is too complex for us to grasp, too\ndifferent from the epistemic rules we ordinarily take ourselves to\nfollow, and endorsing it leaves us with an unsatisfying kind of\nparticularism about rationality. This proposal also runs into the same\nproblem we saw above. If the \u00dcber-Rule is always correct, we must\nsay that it cannot be rationally defeated. If we are willing to accept\nindefeasible rules, why should we think that higher-order defeat\nhappens at all? (Why not just accept the rules governing Aisha\u2019s\nbelief in G as themselves indefeasible by higher-order\ndoubt?) Lasonen-Aarnio concludes that in light of these problems, we\nshould reject higher-order defeat. (See Bradley 2019 for response to\nLasonen-Aarnio, and a defense of the \u00dcber-rule.)\n",
