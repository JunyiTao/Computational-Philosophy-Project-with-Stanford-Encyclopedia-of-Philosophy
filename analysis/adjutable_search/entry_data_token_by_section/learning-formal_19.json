For example, in the black\nraven problem above, the hypothesis \u201cthere is a nonblack\nraven\u201d is verifiable since it is entailed by an observation of a\nnonblack raven. The hypothesis \u201call ravens are black\u201d is\nnot verifiable, since it is not entailed by any finite evidence\nsequence. The following procedure assigns a simplicity rank to each\nhypothesis \\(H\\) from a set of hypotheses \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) [Apsitis 1994,\nLuo and Schulte 2006].\n\nAssign all verifiable hypotheses simplicity rank 0.\nRemove the verifiable hypotheses from the hypothesis space to form\na new hypothesis space \\(\\mathbf{H}_1.\\)\nAssign simplicity rank 1 to the hypotheses that are verifiable\ngiven \\(\\mathbf{H}_1.\\)\nRemove the newly verifiable hypotheses with simplicity rank 1 from\nthe hypothesis space to form a new hypothesis space\n\\(\\mathbf{H}_2.\\)\nContinue removing hypotheses until no new hypotheses are\nverifiable given the current hypothesis space.\nThe simplicity rank of each hypothesis \\(H\\) is the first stage\nat which it is removed by this procedure. In other words, it is the\nindex of the first restricted hypothesis space that makes \\(H\\)\nverifiable.\n\n\nHypotheses with higher simplicity rank are regarded as simpler than\nthose with lower ranks. Simplicity ranks are defined in terms of\nlogical entailment relations, hence are language-invariant. Simplicity\nranks as defined can be seen as degrees of falsifiability in\nthe following sense. Consider a hypothesis of simplicity rank 1. Such\na hypothesis is falsifiable because an evidence sequence that verifies\nan alternative hypothesis of rank 0 falsifies it. Moreover, a\nhypothesis of simplicity rank 1 is persistently falsifiable in the\nsense that it remains falsifiable no matter what evidence sequence\nconsistent with it is observed. A hypothesis of simplicity rank\n\\(n+1\\) is persistently falsifiable by hypotheses of rank \\(n.\\)\nLet us illustrate the definition in our running examples.\n",
