    "main_text": "Absolutism\n8. Absolutism\n\nAlthough Hobbes offered some mild pragmatic grounds for preferring\nmonarchy to other forms of government, his main concern was to argue\nthat effective government\u2014whatever its form\u2014must have\nabsolute authority. Its powers must be neither divided nor limited.\nThe powers of legislation, adjudication, enforcement, taxation,\nwar-making (and the less familiar right of control of normative\ndoctrine) are connected in such a way that a loss of one may thwart\neffective exercise of the rest; for example, legislation without\ninterpretation and enforcement will not serve to regulate conduct.\nOnly a government that possesses all of what Hobbes terms the\n\u201cessential rights of sovereignty\u201d can be reliably\neffective, since where partial sets of these rights are held by\ndifferent bodies that disagree in their judgments as to what is to be\ndone, paralysis of effective government, or degeneration into a civil\nwar to settle their dispute, may occur.\n\nSimilarly, to impose limitation on the authority of the government is\nto invite irresoluble disputes over whether it has overstepped those\nlimits. If each person is to decide for herself whether the government\nshould be obeyed, factional disagreement\u2014and war to settle the\nissue, or at least paralysis of effective government\u2014are quite\npossible. To refer resolution of the question to some further\nauthority, itself also limited and so open to challenge for\noverstepping its bounds, would be to initiate an infinite regress of\nnon-authoritative \u2018authorities\u2019 (where the buck never\nstops). To refer it to a further authority itself unlimited, would be\njust to relocate the seat of absolute sovereignty, a position entirely\nconsistent with Hobbes\u2019s insistence on absolutism. To avoid the\nhorrible prospect of governmental collapse and return to the state of\nnature, people should treat their sovereign as having absolute\nauthority.\n",
