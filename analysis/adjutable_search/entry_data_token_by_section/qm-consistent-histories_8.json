    "main_text": "Quantum Probabilities || Refinement, coarsening, and the single framework rule\n3.4 Refinement, coarsening, and the single framework rule\nA refinement of a sample space is obtained by replacing\none or more of its projectors with other projectors which add up to\nit; conversely a coarsening or coarse graining is obtain by\nadding together two or more projectors in the projective decomposition\nand using the sum as one of the elements in a new decomposition. Given\nthe connection between sample spaces and event algebras as defined\nabove, one sees that the event algebra of a refined sample space is\nlarger than the original event algebra: i.e., it contains all the\noriginal projectors and others in addition; conversely, a coarsening\nleads to a new event algebra which is a subset of the old event\nalgebra.\nTwo quantum sample spaces (projective decompositions) \\(\\{P_j\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{Q_k\\}\\) associated with the same Hilbert space are said to\nbe compatible provided all the projectors in one\ndecomposition commute with all the projectors in the other\ndecomposition: \\(P_jQ_k = Q_k P_j\\) for all \\(j\\) and \\(k\\). Otherwise they\nare incompatible. Note that all projectors in the two event\nalgebras commute if and only if this is true for the sample spaces, so\nit makes sense to talk about compatible and incompatible\nframeworks. When the frameworks are compatible one can combine\nthem. In particular, the coarsest common refinement is given\nby the sample space or decomposition formed by all nonzero products of\nthe form \\(P_jQ_k\\), and the corresponding event algebra contains all\nthe projectors in the original algebras along with the additional ones\nconstructed from their products.\nThe single framework rule says that a specific quantum\nprobabilistic model employs just one sample space and its associated\nevent algebra, and in particular two incompatible\nframeworks cannot be combined. This rule, together with its\nextension to quantum dynamics, see subsection 4.2,\nis a central principle of histories quantum mechanics. It provides a\nguide for quantum reasoning that prevents one from falling into\nparadoxes; conversely, most quantum paradoxes are constructed by\nviolating the single framework rule in some way.\nAs an illustration, consider the one-dimensional harmonic\noscillator of subsection 2.1 and a sample\nspace\n\\[\\SC_a = \\{P,I-P\\};\\quad P = [0] + [1], \\label{eqn7}\\]\ncontaining two projectors, where \\(P\\) corresponds to the case \\(N=1\\)\nin \\eqref{eqn3}. The physical interpretation of \\(P\\) is that the energy\nof the oscillator is no greater than \\((3/2)\\hbar\\omega\\), whereas \\(I-P\\)\nmeans the energy is at least \\((5/2)\\hbar\\omega\\). If \\(P\\) is true it\nmight seem reasonable to conclude that either \\(n=0\\) and the energy is\n\\((1/2)\\hbar\\omega\\), or else \\(n=1\\) and the energy is\n\\((3/2)\\hbar\\omega\\). After all, the energy can only take values\n\\((n+1/2)\\hbar\\omega\\), so does it not follow from the truth of \\(P\\) that\n\\(n=0\\) or \\(n=1\\)? No it does not, and understanding why it does\nnot will expose an important principle of quantum reasoning. The point\nis that probabilistic reasoning, in quantum mechanics or in other\ndisciplines, does not allow one to make inferences about matters which\nare outside the scope of discussion, i.e., which are not contained in\nthe event algebra. The event algebra \\(\\EC_a\\) corresponding to the\nsample space \\(\\SC_a\\) in \\eqref{eqn7} contains \\(P\\) and \\(I-P\\), but does\nnot contain either \\([0]\\) or \\([1]\\), the projectors that correspond to\nthe two lowest energy eigenstates. Consequently, this framework\ndoes not allow for the statement of a result which might seem\nintuitively obvious.\nA solution is readily at hand. In place of \\(\\SC_a\\) use a\nrefinement\n\\[\\SC_b = \\{[0],[1],I-P\\};\\quad P = [0] + [1].  \\label{eqn8}\\]\nNow because \\([0]\\) and \\([1]\\) belong to the event algebra \\(\\EC_b\\)\nthey can be discussed, and the truth of \\(P\\) indeed implies that either\n\\([0]\\) or \\([1]\\) is true: if the energy is not greater than\n\\((3/2)\\hbar\\omega\\) then it is either \\(1/2\\) or \\(3/2\\) \\(\\hbar\\omega\\). But\nis not this insistence that \\(\\SC_b\\) be used in place of \\(\\SC_a\\) a\npiece of sophistry irrelevant to the needs of the working scientist?\nNo, not if the scientist\u2019s work involves quantum mechanics. To see\nwhy, consider an alternative refinement\n\\[\\SC_c = \\{[+],[-],I-P\\};\\quad P = [+] + [-] = [0]+[1]\n\\label{eqn9}\\]\nof \\(\\SC_a\\), where\n\\[\\ket{+} = (\\ket{0} + \\ket{1})/\\sqrt{2},\\quad \\ket{-} = (\\ket{0} -\n\\ket{1})/\\sqrt{2}.  \\label{eqn10}\\]\nSince the event algebra \\(\\EC_c\\) contains \\(P\\) along with \\([+]\\) and\n\\([-]\\), in this framework the truth of \\(P\\) implies that the oscillator\nis either in the state \\([+]\\) or the state \\([-]\\). But neither of these\nare energy eigenstates, and these projectors do not commute with \\([0]\\)\nand \\([1]\\); the relationship is formally the same as that between\neigenstates of \\(S_x\\) and those of \\(S_z\\) for a spin-half\nparticle, subsection 2.3. Consequently, if\nresults using frameworks \\(\\EC_b\\) and \\(\\EC_c\\) are carelessly combined,\nit is possible to infer for the oscillator something quite analogous\nto the meaningless assertions combining properties of \\(S_x\\) and\n\\(S_z\\). Hence the importance of the single framework rule which\nprohibits combining \\(\\EC_b\\) and \\(\\EC_c\\) (equivalently, \\(\\SC_b\\) and\n\\(\\SC_c\\)).\nIf \\(\\EC_b\\) and \\(\\EC_c\\) cannot be combined, which is\nthe correct framework to use in describing a harmonic\noscillator? The answer, again a key point in the histories\ninterpretation, which will be discussed in more detail\nin section 5, and also section\n11, is that in the quantum world there is never a single correct\nframework, there are always many possibilities, something rather\nstrange from the perspective of classical physics. The single\nframework rule prohibits combining incompatible frameworks;\nit does not assert that there is just one correct framework\nto use in modeling a particular physical situation.\nOne may add that in the early days of quantum theory there was a\ntendency among the practitioners to think that quantum systems must\nalways be in states of well-defined energy, and this led to various\nconundrums. Nowadays states which are superpositions of the ground\nstate and an excited state of an atom are produced routinely in\nquantum optics experiments, and thus analogs of \\(\\EC_c\\) can be quite\nrelevant for a quantum description of what goes on in the\nlaboratory.\n",
