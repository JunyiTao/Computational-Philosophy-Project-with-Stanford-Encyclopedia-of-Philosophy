Idealism in Early Modern Rationalism\n\nPrior to Wolff, neither defending nor refuting idealism seems to have\nbeen a central issue for rationalist philosophers, and none of them\ncalled themselves idealists. Yet what are by later lights idealistic\ntendencies can nevertheless be found among them.\n\nWhile Descartes\u2019s \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d clearly defends\ndualism, he takes his target to be skepticism rather than idealism,\nand thus is from our point of view concerned to resist the adoption of\nepistemological grounds; Spinoza is often though controversially\nthought to defend a form of materialism, but takes his primary target\nto be pluralism as contrasted to monism; and Leibniz does not seem\noverly worried about choosing between idealist and dualist forms of\nhis \u201cmonadology\u201d, while his famous thesis that each monad\nrepresents the entire universe from its own point of view might be\ntaken to be a form of epistemological ground for idealism, but Leibniz\ndoes not seem to conceive of it as such. Nicolas Malebranche\u2019s\ntheory of \u201cseeing all things in God\u201d might be the closest\nwe find to an explicit assertion in seventeenth-century philosophy of\nan argument for idealism on both epistemological and ontological\ngrounds, and thus as a forerunner of the \u201cabsolute\u201d\nidealism of the nineteenth century. While from a later point of view\nit may seem surprising that these rationalists were not more concerned\nwith explicitly asserting or refuting one or both versions of\nidealism, perhaps they were more concerned with theological puzzles\nabout the nature and essence of God, metaphysical questions as to how\nto reconcile the respective conception of God with views about the\ninteraction of substances of fundamentally different kinds, and\nepistemological problems as to the possibility of knowledge and\ncognitive certainty than they were worried about whether the ultimate\nconstituents of reality were mental or material elements.\n\nHowever, if one were to situate their thoughts within the framework\nprovided by Wolff it is not that difficult to find traces of idealism\nderived from both ontological and epistemological grounds in their\nrespective positions. With respect to their metaphysical or\nontological teachings, this claim may seem surprising. Whereas\naccording to Wolff idealists are representatives of a species of\nmetaphysical monism Descartes is one of the most outspoken\nmetaphysical dualists. Hence to impute idealistic tendencies to\nDescartes\u2019 metaphysics looks like a mistake. And in the case of\nSpinoza one could argue that although he definitely is a (very\nradical) monist and thus could count as an idealist within\nWolff\u2019s taxonomy, he is traditionally considered to be rather a\nmaterialist in Wolff\u2019s sense. Consequently, it appears as if\nalready for conceptual reasons there is no basis to burden either\nDescartes or Spinoza with idealism as defined by Wolff. Leibniz,\nmeanwhile, often seems unwilling to commit himself to idealism even\nthough that is the most natural interpretation of his monadology,\nwhile only Malebranche, as noted, seems to come close to explicitly\nasserting epistemological and perhaps ontological arguments for\nidealism as well.\n\nNevertheless, both Descartes and Spinoza provide a starting point for\ntheir metaphysical doctrines with their conceptions of God, a starting\npoint that is already infected with idealistic elements if idealism is\nunderstood as implying a commitment to the primacy or at least the\nunavoidability and irreducibility of mental items in the constitution\nand order of things in general. Both agree that in order to gain\ninsight into the constitution of the world one has to find out what\nGod wants us, or maybe better: allows us to know about it (see, e.g.,\nDescartes: Meditations IV, 7\u20138 and especially 13;\nSpinoza: Ethics I, XVI). They also agree that the world is\ncreated by God although they have different views as to what this\nmeans. Whereas Descartes thinks of God as existing outside the world\nof the existing things He created (see Meditations III, 13\nand 22) Spinoza holds that whatever exists is just a peculiar way in\nwhich God is present (see Ethics I, XXV, Corollary). Of all\nexisting things all that God permits us to know clearly and distinctly\nis (again according to both Descartes and Spinoza) that their nature\nconsists either in thinking or in extension. This claim can be seen as\nproviding in the case of Descartes the basis for his justification of\nontological dualism. His distinction between extended and thinking\nsubstances is not just meant to give rise to a complete classification\nof all existing things in virtue of their main attributes but also to\nhighlight the irreducibility of mental (thinking) substances to\nphysical or corporeal (extended) substances because of differences\nbetween their intrinsic natures (see, e.g., Meditations VI,\n19, and Principles of Philosophy I, 51\u201354). In the case\nof Spinoza thinking and extension not only refer to attributes of\nindividual things but primarily to attributes of God (see Ethics\nII, Proposition I, II, and VII, Scholium), making them the\nfundamental ways in which God himself expresses his nature in each\nindividual thing. This move gives rise to his ontological monism\nbecause he can claim that all individual things are just modes in\nwhich God\u2019s presence is expressed according to these\nattributes.\n\nAlthough the idea that God is the creator of the world of individual\nexisting things (Descartes) or that God himself is manifested in every\nindividual existing thing (Spinoza) might already be considered to be\nsufficient as a motivating force for subsequent disputes as to the\ntrue nature of reality and thus might have given rise to what were\nthen called \u201cidealistic\u201d positions in ontology, other\npeculiarities within Descartes\u2019 and Spinoza\u2019s position\nmight well have led to the same result, i.e., to the adoption of\nidealism on ontological grounds. Especially their disagreement about\nGod\u2019s corporeality might have been such a motive. Whereas\nDescartes vigorously denies the corporeality of God (Principles of\nPhilosophy I, 23) and hence could be seen as endorsing idealism,\nSpinoza vehemently insists on God\u2019s corporeality (Ethics\nI, Proposition XV, Scholium) and thus could be taken to be in\nfavor of materialism.\n\nThings are different when it comes to epistemological grounds for\nidealism. It seems to be very difficult to connect Descartes\u2019\nand Spinoza\u2019s views concerning knowledge with conceptions\naccording to which knowledge has something to do with a cognizing\nsubject actively contributing to the constitution of the object of\nknowledge. This is so because both Descartes and Spinoza think of\ncognition as a result of a process in which we become aware of what\nreally is the case independently of us both with respect to the nature\nof objects and with respect to their conceptual and material\nrelations. Descartes and Spinoza take cognition to be a process of\ngrasping clear and distinct ideas of what is the true character of\nexisting things rather than a process of contributing to the formation\nof their nature. According to Descartes the sources of our knowledge\nof things are our abilities to have intuitions of the simple nature of\nthings and to draw conclusions from these intuitions via deduction\n(Rules for the Direction of the Mind III, 4 ff.). For him the\ncognitive procedure is a process of discovery (see Discourse on\nthe Method, Part 6, 6) of what already is out there as the real\nnature of things created by God by finding out the clear and distinct\nideas we can have of them (Discourse, Part 4, 3 and 7). In a\nsimilar vein Spinoza thinks of knowledge as an activity that in its\nhighest form as intuitive (or third genus of) cognition leads to an\nadequate insight into the essence of things (Ethics II,\nProposition XL, Scholium II, and Ethics V, Propositions\nXXV\u2013XXVIII), an insight that gives rise to general concepts\n(notiones communes) on which ratiocinationes, i.e.,\nthe processes of inference and deduction, are based (Ethics\nII, Proposition XL, Scholium I) the results of which provide the\nsecond genus of cognition (ratio). Thus the problem for both\nDescartes and Spinoza is not so much that of the epistemologically\nmotivated idealist, i.e., to uncover what we contribute through our\ncognitive faculties to our conception of an object, rather their\nproblem is to determine how it comes that we very often have a\ndistorted view of what there is and are accordingly led to misguided\nbeliefs and errors. Given what they take to be a basic fact that God\nhas endowed us with the capacity to know the truth (albeit within\ncertain limits), i.e., to know to a certain degree how or what things\nreally are, this interest in the possibility of error makes perfectly\ngood sense (Meditations IV, 3\u201317; Principles of\nPhilosophy I, 70\u201372; Ethics II, Proposition 49,\nScholium).\n\nIn his project for a \u201cuniversal characteristic\u201d, Leibniz\ncan be regarded as having taken great interest in a method\nfor inquiry, but he does not seem to have taken much interest in the\nepistemological issue of skepticism or the possibility of knowledge,\nand thus did not explicitly characterize his famous\n\u201cmonadology\u201d as a form of an epistemological ground for\nidealism. But he did take a great interest in the ontology of\nsubstances, God the infinite substance and everything else as finite\nsubstances (in contrast to Spinoza, he rejected monism). Yet while the\nlogic of his monadology clearly points toward idealism, Leibniz\nfrequently attempted to avoid this conclusion. One explicitly\nontological argument for the monadology that Leibniz often deploys is\nthat, on pain of infinite regress, everything composite must\nultimately consist of simples, but that since space and time are\ninfinitely divisible extended matter cannot be simple while thoughts,\neven with complex content, do not literally have parts, nor do the\nminds that have them, so minds, or monads, are the only candidates for\nthe ultimate constituents of reality. Thus the late text entitled\n\u201cThe Monadology\u201d begins with the assertions that \n\n\nThe monad which we are here to discuss is nothing but a\nsimple substance which enters into compounds, \n\n\nthat \n\n\nThere must be simple substances, since there are compounds, [and] the\ncompounded is but a collection or an aggregate of simples,\n\n\n\nbut that \n\n\nwhere there are no parts, it is impossible to have either extension,\nor figure, or divisibility \n\n\nand conversely where there is simplicity there cannot be extension or\nfigure or divisibility (\u00a7\u00a71\u20133). Yet monads must have\nsome qualities in order to exist (\u00a78) and to differ from one\nanother, as they must (\u00a79), and if the fundamental properties of\nmatter are excluded, this leaves the fundamental properties of mind,\nwhich Leibniz holds to be perception, \u201cThe passing state which\nenfolds and represents a multitude in unity\u201d (\u00a714) and\nappetition, \u201cthe internal principle which brings about change or\nthe passage from one perception to another\u201d (\u00a715; all from\nPPL: 643\u20134). This argument clearly seems to imply that\nall finite substances are ultimately mental in nature (and the\ninfinite substance, God, is obviously mental in nature), thus it seems\nto be a paradigmatic ontological argument for idealism, from which an\nepistemological argument for idealism would automatically follow,\nsince if there is knowledge of reality at all, which Leibniz hardly\nseems to doubt, and reality is ultimately mental, then knowledge too\nmust be of the mental.\n\nYet Leibniz often seems to avert such a conclusion by appeal to his\nidea of \u201cpre-established harmony\u201d, and this is possible\nbecause he himself interprets this idea in two different ways. Early\nin his career, in such texts as \u201cPrimary Truths\u201d\n(1680\u201384) and the \u201cDiscourse on Metaphysics\u201d (1686)\n(both texts unpublished in Leibniz\u2019s lifetime and not known to\nhis immediate successors such as Wolff and Baumgarten), Leibniz\nintroduces the doctrine of pre-established harmony on\ntruth-theoretical grounds. His argument is that everything that is\ntrue of a substance is so because the predicate of a true proposition\nis contained in the complete concept of its subject and because that\ncomplete concept reflects the properties or \u201ctraces\u201d in\nthe substance that is that subject; that there are true propositions\nlinking every substance in the world to every other, thus the complete\nconcept of each substance must be a complete concept of the universe\nitself and each substance must bear within itself as properties traces\nof every other in the universe; and thus that each substance must\nreflect, or, as mental, represent the entire universe. Yet since\n(finite) substances are also defined as existing independently of one\nanother (although not existing independently from the infinite\nsubstance, God), there is a question as to why each should truthfully\nrepresent all the others, which Leibniz answers by appeal to the idea\nof a pre-established harmony: although considered from the point of\nview of the concept of substance it does not seem necessary that every\nsubstance truly represent all the others, in his goodness, thus in his\npreference for a maximally harmonious world, God has nevertheless made\nit such that they do.\n\nIn this mood, Leibniz tends to explain the existence of body as an\nartifact of the fact that each monad represents the world from its own\npoint of view: physical locations and the bodies that occupy them are\njust the way in which the difference in the points of view of the\nmonads is represented by them, but have no deeper reality; or, as\nLeibniz often says, space, spatiality, and bodies are just\nphenomena bene fundata, i.e., \u201cwell-founded modes of\nour consideration\u201d (PPL: 270).\n\nHowever, sometimes Leibniz writes as if space and time are not merely\nthe way in which the pre-established harmony among monads presents\nitself to (their) consciousness, but as if the mental and physical or\nextended are two separate realms, each evolving entirely in accordance\nwith its own laws, but with a pre-established harmony between\nthem creating the appearance of interaction. Perhaps Leibniz was\ngenuinely undecided between two interpretations of the pre-established\nharmony and two conceptions of the reality of body, sometimes being a\ncommitted idealism and sometimes a dualist. (As we will see later,\neven among the most committed absolute idealists of the nineteenth\ncentury it is not always clear whether they are actually denying the\nexistence of matter or only subordinating it to mind in one way or\nanother).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s monadology could thus be seen as a forerunner of both\nepistemological and ontological arguments for idealism, and his\nconception of space and time as phenomena bene fundata was\nclearly a forerunner of Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism. But as\nwe have just seen, he did not himself unequivocally affirm idealism,\nand as we will shortly see subsequent Leibnizians such as Alexander\nBaumgarten argued for dualism and for a corresponding interpretation\nof pre-established harmony. Nicolas Malebranche was also a dualist,\ncommitted to the existence of both mind and body, and an\noccasionalist, who held that since causation is necessary connection\nand the only truly necessary connection is between God\u2019s\nintentions and their effects, bodies cannot directly cause\nmodifications of minds (or each other) but rather there can be a\ncausal relation between body and mind only if God intends the mind to\nundergo a certain modification upon the occasion of a certain change\nin a body (hence the term \u201coccasionalism\u201d). This is a\nmetaphysical argument. His further doctrine that the mind sees all\nthings in God, however, can be seen as an epistemological argument,\nfor it depends on his particular view of what modifications the mind\nundergoes in perception. He holds that sensations are\nliterally modifications in the mind, but that they are highly\nindeterminate, or in later terminology lack determinate intentional\nobjects, and that genuine understanding occurs only when and to the\nextent that the determinate ideas in the perfect intellect of\nGod are disclosed to finite, human minds, to the extent that they are.\nMalebranche\u2019s position can be considered a theological form of\nPlatonism: Plato held that the true Ideas or Forms of things have a\nkind of perfection that neither ordinary objects nor representations\nof them in human minds do, and therefore must exist someplace else;\nMalebranche takes the obvious further step of supposing that perfect\nideas can exist only in the perfect intellect of God. He then supposes\nthat human thought is intelligible to the extent that these ideas are\ndisclosed to it, on the occasion of various sensations themselves\noccasioned by God but not literally through those sensations. The\ncrucial point is that genuine understanding consists in the\napprehension of ideas, even though these are literally in the mind of\nGod rather than of individual human beings, rather than of physical\nobjects, even though the latter do exist. Malebranche had significant\ninfluence on both Berkeley and Hume, although neither the former and\ncertainly not the latter accepted his position in its entirety. His\nposition that knowledge consists in individual minds apprehending\nideas in some greater mind would also be recreated by idealists as\nlate as T.H. Green and Josiah Royce in the second half of the\nnineteenth century, as we will later see.\n\nBefore we turn to British or Anglophone versions of idealism, earlier\nor later, one last word about idealism within pre-Kantian rationalist\nphilosophy is in order. As earlier mentioned, dualism rather than\nidealism became the default position of the German successors to\nLeibniz, the so-called \u201cLeibnizo-Wolffians\u201d who dominated\nthe teaching of philosophy in many German universities for fifty years\nfrom the third decade of the eighteenth century until the time of Kant\nand in some cases even beyond, and they correspondingly opted for the\ninterpretation of the pre-established harmony as a relation between\nminds and bodies rather than among minds or monads alone. It may also\nbe noted that defending dualism by means of an explicit\n\u201crefutation of idealism\u201d became the norm among these\nphilosophers. This may be seen in Alexander Gottlieb\nBaumgarten\u2019s Metaphysica of 1739, which would become\nKant\u2019s textbook for his lecture courses in metaphysics and\n\u201canthropology\u201d (empirical psychology) until the very end\nof the eighteenth century. Baumgarten accepts that the ultimate\nconstituents of the world must be simples, hence monads of some kind.\nBut he does not suppose that monads are necessarily minds or\nintellects, hence a dualism of monads is at least possible. Idealism\nwould be the position that there are only intellectual monads; he says\nthat\n\n\nAn intellectual substance, i.e., a substance endowed with intellect,\nis a spirit (an intelligence, a person)\u2026. Whoever admits only\nspirits in this world is an idealist. (Metaphysics,\n\u00a7402, pp. 175\u20136)\n\n\nBaumgarten follows Wolff in distinguishing between two possible forms\nof idealism, first egoism, which admits the existence of only one\nspirit, that of the person contemplating such a doctrine, and then\nidealism proper, which allows the existence of multiple spirits. But\nboth are refuted by the same argument. This argument builds on a\nLeibnizian principle not hitherto mentioned, the principle of\nplenitude, or the principle that the perfection of the most perfect\nworld, which is the one that God created, consists in the maximal\nvariety of the universe compatible with its unity or coherence (e.g.,\n\u201cMonadology\u201d, \u00a758, PPL: 648), which was in\nturn the basis of one of Leibniz\u2019s arguments for the identity of\nindiscernibles. Baumgarten then argues simply that a universe that\ncontains not only more substances but also more kinds of\nsubstances rather than fewer is a more perfect universe, and\nnecessarily exists in preference to the other; and a universe that\ncontains not only multiple minds rather than a single mind but also\nbodies in addition to minds is therefore a more perfect universe than\neither of the former would be, and is therefore the kind of world that\nactually exists. In his words,\n\n\nthe egotistical world, such as an egoist posits, is not the most\nperfect. And even if there is only one non-intellectual monad possible\nin itself that is compossible with spirits in the world, whose\nperfection either subtracts nothing from the perfection of the\nspirits, or does not subtract from the perfection of the spirits so\nmuch as it adds to the perfection of the whole, then the idealistic\nworld, such as is posited by the idealist, is not the most perfect,\n(Metaphysics, \u00a7438, [2013: 183])\n\n\nand hence not the kind of world that exists. No one outside of the\nimmediate sphere of Leibnizianism would ever again proffer such a\nrefutation of idealism. But both Baumgarten\u2019s recognition of\nidealism and his refutation of it in a university textbook make it\nclear that by the middle of the eighteenth century idealism had become\na standard topic for philosophical discussion, a position it would\nretain for another century and a half or more.\n",
