    "main_text": "Philosophical views || Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics\n3.5 Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics\nA theological physics\n\n\nAlthough Proclus composed a short (presumably early) treatise where\nhe summarises Aristotle\u2019s theory of movement (Elements of\nPhysics), he does not understand Physics primarily as the\nstudy of movement and change of natural phenomena, but rather seeks to\nconnect these phenomena to their intelligible and divine causes\n(Physics as a kind of Theology, In\nTim. I 217.25). In the preface to his commentary on\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus Proclus sets out to prove why\nPlato\u2019s physics, as developed in the Timaeus, is\nsuperior to natural science in the Aristotelian sense (see Steel 2003).\nIn Proclus\u2019 view Plato\u2019s Timaeus not only offers a\nphysiologia, a science of nature in its many aspects, but also\npresents an explanation of the whole of nature by paying due attention\nto its incorporeal, divine causes: the natural world proceeds from the\ndemiurge as the expression of an ideal paradigm and aims at the ultimate\nGood. Therefore, Plato\u2019s physio-logy is also a sort of\ntheo-logy:\n\n\nThe purpose of Timaeus will be to consider the\nuniverse, insofar as it is produced by the gods. In fact, one may\nconsider the world from different perspectives: insofar as it is\ncorporeal or insofar as it participates in souls, both particular and\nuniversal, or insofar as it is endowed with intellect. But Timaeus will\nexamine the nature of the universe not only along all those aspects,\nbut in particular insofar as it proceeds from the demiurge. In that\nrespect the physiology seems also to be a sort of theology, since also\nnatural things have somehow a divine existence insofar as they are\nproduced by the gods. (In Tim. I\n217.18\u201327)\n\n\nBefore offering an explanation of the generation of the world,\nTimaeus sets out the fundamental principles that will govern his whole\nexplanation of the physical world (Tim. 27d5\u201328b5). As Proclus\nobserves, it is the task of a scientist to formulate at the start of\nhis project the principles proper to the science in question, and not\njust to assume some general axioms. The science of nature too is based\non specific axioms and assumptions, which must be clarified before we\ncan move to the demonstration. In order to make phusiologia a\nreal science, the philosopher must deduce his explanation, as does the\ngeometer, from a set of fundamental propositions or axioms.\n\n\nIf I may say what I think, it seems to me that Plato proceeds\nhere in the manner of the geometers, assuming before the demonstrations\nthe definitions and hypotheses through which he will make his\ndemonstrations, thus laying the foundations of the whole science of\nnature. (In Tim. I.217.18\u201327)\n\n\n\n\nStarting from these fundamental propositions, Proclus argues, Plato\ndeduces the different types of causality that are required for a truly\nscientific understanding of nature (efficient, exemplary, and final\ncause; see Steel 2003 and above 3.2).\nTime and eternity\n\n\nProclus discusses eternity and time in his commentary on the\nTimaeus and in propositions 53\u201355 of the Elements of\nTheology (see Steel 2001). Aristotle had defined time as a\n\u201cmeasure of movement according to the before and after.\u201d\nTherefore, anything measured by time must have a form of existence or\nactivity in which a past and a future state can be distinguished. In\nfact, an entity in time is never wholly and simultaneously what it is,\nbut has an existence extended in a process of before and after. Opposed\nto it stands the eternal, which exists as a simultaneous whole and\nadmits of no composition or change. \u201cThere is no part of\nit,\u201d writes Proclus, \u201cwhich has already subsisted and\nanother that will subsist later, but as yet is not. All that it is\ncapable of being, already possesses it in entirety without losing it or\nwithout accumulating\u201d (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 52).\nOne must distinguish the temporality of things in process from the time\nby which they are measured. Temporal things participate in time,\nwithout being time. \u201cTime exists prior to all things in\ntime\u201d (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 53). \n\n\nWith Iamblichus, Proclus distinguishes absolute time, which is not\nparticipated in and exists \u2018prior\u2019 to all temporal things,\nfrom participated time, or rather the many participated times. The same\ndistinctions must also be made regarding eternity. For Eternity\nprecedes as cause and measures the multiple eternal beings that\nparticipate in it. \u201cEvery Eternity is a measure of things\neternal, every Time of things in time; and these two are the only\nmeasures of life and movement in things\u201d (Elem.\nTheol. \u00a7 54). To conclude, there are two measures of the\nduration of things. First there is eternity, which measures at once the\nwhole duration of a being. Second, there is time, which measures\npiecemeal the extension of a being that continually passes from one\nstate to another. Eternity can be seen as the prefiguration of time;\ntime as the image of eternity. Each of them governs a separate sphere\nof reality, eternity the intelligible being, time the temporal\n(corporeal and psychic) world of change. \n\n\nNotwithstanding the sharp distinction between the temporal and the\neternal realm, there are beings that share in both eternity and\ntime. As Proclus notes in the corollary\nto Elem. Theol. \u00a7 55, \u201cof the things\nwhich exist in time, some have a perpetual duration.\u201d Thus the\nuniverse as a whole and the celestial spheres in it are\nboth eternal and temporal. They are eternal because\nthey never come to existence in time and never will cease to exist. But\nthey are temporal because they possess their being only through a\nprocess of change in a sequence of moments. The same holds true for the\npsychic realm: all souls are immortal and indestructible; nevertheless,\nthey are continually undergoing change. Therefore, as Proclus says,\n\u201c\u2018perpetuity\u2019 (aidiot\u00eas) is of two\nkinds, the one eternal (ai\u00f4nion), the other in time;\n[\u2026] the one having its being concentrated in a simultaneous\nwhole, the other diffused and unfolded in temporal extension\n(paratasis); the one entire in itself, the other composed of\nparts, each of which exists separately in a sequence of prior and\nposterior.\u201d (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 55, trans. Dodds,\nmodified).\nThe eternity of the world\n\n\nAgainst Aristotle\u2019s critique in De Caelo I 10, Proclus\ndefends the view that the cosmos is \u201cboth eternal and generated\n(gen\u00eatos).\u201d As a corporeal being, the universe\ncannot produce itself and maintain itself in being. It depends for its\nexistence upon a superior cause, and it is for that reason\n\u201cgenerated.\u201d This does not prevent it, however, from\nexisting for ever, in an infinite time. As we just saw, Proclus\ndistinguishes between what is eternal in an absolute sense (the\nintelligible realm) and what is eternal because it continues to exist\nfor the whole of time, what Boethius later called\n\u201caevum\u201d in distinction from\n\u201caeternum.\u201d As Proclus notices, at the end of the\nPhysics (8.10, 266a27\u201328), Aristotle himself\nestablishes that no body can possess from itself an unlimited power to\nexist. If the world exists eternally, it must have this power from an\nincorporeal principle. Therefore, Aristotle too is forced to admit that\nthe world is somehow generated, though it continues to exist for\neternity. For it always receives from its cause its infinite power and\nnever possesses it at once as a whole, because it is limited. The world\nis eternal, because it has an infinite power of coming to be,\nnot because it exists of infinite power (In Tim. I\n252.11\u2013254.18).\n\n\nThis disagreement between Plato and Aristotle is ultimately due to a\ndifferent view about the first principles of all things. Aristotle\ndenies the existence of Platonic Forms and therefore cannot admit an\nefficient or creative cause of the universe in the true sense of the\nword. Efficient causality only concerns the sublunary world. The\ncelestial bodies and the world as a whole have no efficient cause of\ntheir being, but only a final cause. From this misunderstanding about\nthe first principles follow all the other views that distinguish\nAristotle from Plato. One gets the impression, Proclus says, that\nAristotle, because he could not grasp the first principle of all things\n- the One \u2013 has always to find an explanation of things on a\nlower level:\n\n\nWhatever Plato attributes to the One, Aristotle attributes to\nthe intellect: that it is without multiplicity, that it is object of\ndesire, that it does not think of secondary things. Whatever Plato\nattributes to the demiurgic intellect, Aristotle attributes to the\nheaven and the celestial gods. For, in his view, creation and\nprovidence come from them. Whatever Plato attributes to the substance\nof heavens [sc. time], Aristotle attributes to their circular motion.\nIn all these issues he departs from the theological principles and\ndwells upon the physical explanations beyond what is needed.\n(In Tim. I 295.20\u201327)\nThe celestial bodies and the place of the universe\n\n\nRelated to the eternity of the world is the question of the nature of\nthe celestial bodies. Aristotle argues in De Caelo I 2 that\nthe celestial bodies, which move with a natural circular motion, must\nbe made of a simple substance different from the four sublunary simple\nbodies (whose natural movements are in a straight line: up or down).\nThis \u2018fifth element,\u2019 which is by nature imperishable, is\nthe ether. With this explanation Aristotle seems to oppose the view\nPlato defends in Timaeus where it is said that the Demiurge\nmade the divine celestial bodies \u201cmostly out of fire\u201d\n(40a2\u20134). Proclus admits that the heaven is composed out of the\nfour elements with a preponderance of fire, but he insists that the\nelements are not present in the celestial bodies in the same mode as\nthey exist in the sublunary bodies. Therefore Aristotle is right when\nhe considers the heavens to constitute a fifth nature besides the four\nelements. \u201cFor in the heavens the elements are not the same as\nthey are here, but are rather the summits of them\u201d\n(In Tim. II 49.27\u201329). If one counts the whole\nheaven composed out of the best of the elements as one nature and adds\nto it the four sublunary elements, we may speak of five natures\naltogether.\n\n\nContrary to Aristotle, Proclus argues that the whole universe (to\npan) is in a place (topos). He can do this because his\nconception of place differs in many respects from Aristotle\u2019s own. The\nlatter defined place as \u201cthe unmoved limit of the surrounding\nbody\u201d (Physics IV 4, 212a21\u201322). From\nthis it follows as a necessary corollary that the universe as a whole\ncannot be in a place, because there is simply nothing outside\nit. Aristotle\u2019s definition, as we learn from Simplicius\u2019 and\nPhiloponus\u2019 Corollary on Place, had been criticized by all\nlater Neoplatonists (Syrianus, Proclus, Damascius, Simplicius, and\nPhiloponus). It is notable that Proclus\u2019 own theory of place, as\nreported by Simplicius, differs considerably from other Neoplatonic\ntheories in that he considered place an immaterial \u2018body\u2019,\nnamely a special kind of immobile light. As emerges from\nProclus\u2019 Commentary on Plato\u2019s Republic, his theory took\ninspiration from the column of light mentioned at\nRepublic X, 616b.\nAstronomy\n\n\nSince the heavenly bodies were considered divine, because they are\neternal and living beings, the study of the heavens was of special\nimportance to Neoplatonists. In the preface to his treatise On\nAstronomical Hypotheses (a summary and evaluation of astronomical\nviews of his time), Proclus makes it clear that his approach is based\non Plato\u2019s remarks on astronomy (especially in the\nRepublic and in the Laws). He feels the need to go\nthrough the different theories, because one can observe a great\ndisagreement among ancient astronomers on how to explain the different\nphenomena (Hyp. I \u00a7 33). Fundamental to Proclus\u2019\napproach is the distinction between two kinds of astronomy\n(Hyp. I \u00a7 1\u20133). The first kind contents itself with\nobserving the heavenly phenomena and formulating mathematical\nhypotheses to explain them and make calculations and prognostics\npossible. This is the astronomy as practiced by the most famous\nastronomers before Proclus\u2019 time (Aristarchus, Hipparchus, and\nPtolemy). The second, which is developed by Plato in the\nTimaeus, and is confirmed by the tradition of the\n\u201cChaldaeans and Egyptians,\u201d investigates into the\nintelligible causes of heavenly movements. An example for this approach\ncan be found in his Commentary on Plato\u2019s Republic\n(In Remp. II 227.23\u2013235.3). There,\nProclus explains that the seemingly irregular movements of the\nplanets ought not to be explained by means of Ptolemy\u2019s\ncomplicated theory of excentric spheres and epicycles, but are rather\ndue to the fact that the planets are moved by intelligent souls which\nexpress in the movements of their bodies \u201cthe invisible powers of\nthe Forms\u201d (232.1\u20134). Yet Proclus appreciates Ptolemy\u2019s\nastronomy as long as it is seen only as a mathematical-mechanical\nconstruction making it possible to calculate and predict the positions\nof planets, and as long as it does not claim to have any real\nexplanatory value. For the history of astronomy Proclus\u2019\nAstronomical Hypotheses remains a most valuable document,\nsince it represents one of the best introductions to Ptolemy\u2019s\nAlmagest extant from antiquity and since it explains the most\nimportant ancient astronomical theories, in order finally (in chapter\nseven of the work) to evaluate them critically. Proclus\u2019\narguments also played an important role in the scientific discussion of\nthe Ptolemaic hypotheses in the 16th and 17th\ncentury.\nMathematics\n\n\nProclus\u2019 distinctively non-empirical approach towards physics\nand astronomy also influences his philosophy of mathematics, which is\nset out in the two prologues to his commentary on the first book of\nEuclid\u2019s Elements. The first prologue deals with the\nmathematical sciences in general, while the second prologue focuses on\ngeometry proper. Proclus argues in great detail that the objects of\nmathematical sciences cannot be derived from sensible particulars by\nmeans of abstraction. Because of the imperfect and deficient\ncharacter of the sensible objects one cannot derive from them objects\nthat are as perfect and as precise as mathematical objects are.\nTherefore, mathematical objects reside primarily in intellect and\nsecondarily in souls (as logoi). As universal concepts (cf.\n3.2) we can grasp mathematical objects by means of recollection\n(anamn\u00easis). Since geometrical objects are not\nuniversal, but particulars, and since by definition they possess\nextension, Proclus argues that their place is human imagination\n(phantasia). Imagination acts as a mirror and provides the\nmathematical objects which are projected into it by the soul with\nintelligible matter. By means of the latter geometrical objects gain\nextension and particularity. As with physics and astronomy, the\nultimate aim of geometry is not the study of these extended, material\nobjects. Rather, geometry serves an anagogical task (just as in\nPlato\u2019s Republic), leading the soul upwards to a study\nof the true and unextended causes of geometrical objects in the divine\nmind (In Eucl. 54.14\u201356.22).\n",
