    "main_text": "\n\nThe problem of replication and reproduction arises out of the history\nof genetics [see the entry\n gene\n for a historical review]. It is tied to the concept of the gene and\nits generalization in an evolutionary context [see the entry\n evolution].\n Richard Dawkins introduced the notion of replicators\u2014things\nthat self-replicate\u2014as a universalization of evolutionary\nunderstandings of genes. Dawkins argued that replicators are the\nsine qua non of evolution by natural selection [see the entry\n natural selection],\n while other accounts only require reproduction as one of its\ndefining features. What exactly is a replicator? How are replicators\ndifferent from genes? Can evolution by natural selection occur without\nthe existence of replicators? Besides the biological domain, are there\nany other domains in which replicators have been postulated? To answer\nthese questions, we will first provide some background for\nDawkins\u2019 notion of the replicator and its ties with the concepts\nof the gene and information. We will then introduce the distinction\nbetween replicators and vehicles in the context of\nbiological evolution, followed by the extension of this to other\ndomains. Finally, we will discuss some of the challenges to the idea\nthat replicators are necessary conditions for evolution by natural\nselection.\n",
