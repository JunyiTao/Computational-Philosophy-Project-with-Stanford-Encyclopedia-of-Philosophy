    "main_text": "Some Recent Accounts of Structured Propositions || The Neo-Russellian Approach\n3.1 The Neo-Russellian Approach\n\nIn a series of papers and a book, Scott Soames [1985, 1987, 1989] and\nNathan Salmon [1986a, 1986b, 1989a, 1989b] have laid out what is\nprobably the best known current theory of structured propositions.\nThere are some differences of detail between Salmon and Soames, but\nboth shall be treated here as holding the same view. Though some of\ntheir contributions will be discussed separately, the main account\nfollowed will be that laid out in Soames [1987].\n\nFirst, Soames [1985,1987] produced what many take to be a devastating\nattack on the view of propositions as sets of possible worlds. Soames\nshowed that even when one tries to get more fine-grained\npropositions-as-sets-of-worlds by allowing metaphysically impossible\nworlds (e.g. worlds in which George Bush is identical with Ronald\nReagan), inconsistent worlds (in which a thing can both possess and\nlack a property), and incomplete worlds (where some purported\n\u201cmatters of fact\u201d are simply not settled), the resulting\nview, when combined with other independently plausible assumptions, is\nriddled with overwhelming difficulties. These difficulties all stem\nfrom the fact, noted earlier, that on the worlds view, sentences with\nvery different syntactic structures and containing words with\ndifferent semantic values may express the same proposition. Soames\n[1987] concludes that we ought to give up the view that propositions\nare sets of worlds of any sort, and embrace an account of propositions\naccording to which propositions are structured entities, with\nindividuals, properties and relations as constituents. Soames called\nthese structured Russellian propositions. If the syntactic structures\nof sentences and the semantic values of words occurring in them are\nreflected in the structures and constituents of propositions they\nexpress, sentences with different syntactic structures and containing\nwords with different semantic values, whether true in all the same\nworlds or not, may express different propositions. It is perhaps worth\nnoting that having sentences with different syntactic structures and\ncontaining words with different semantic values express different\npropositions doesn\u2019t require one to hold that propositions\nthemselves are structured and contain the semantic values of the words\nas constituents. Still, it is a natural way of accounting for why\nsentences with different syntactic structures and containing words\nwith different semantic values that are true in all the same worlds\nexpress different propositions. Soames [1987] sketches a formal theory\nof structured propositions, including an assignment of structured\npropositions to the sentences of a simple formal language, and a\ndefinition of truth relative to a circumstance for structured\npropositions.\n\nSoames and Salmon are direct reference theorists, holding that names\n(as well as indexicals and demonstratives) have their referents as\ntheir semantic values and so contribute them to the propositions\nexpressed by sentences containing them. Further they hold that\npredicates and intransitive verbs have properties as their semantic\nvalues; and that transitive verbs have relations as their semantic\nvalues. Thus they hold that sentences such as\n\n(4) Scott\nruns.\n(5) Scott saw\nNathan.\n\n\nexpress the propositions\n\n(4a) <\u2009<\u2009o\u2009>,\nR\u2009>\n(5a) <\u2009<\u2009o,\no\u2032\u2009>, S\u2009>\n\n\nwhere o is Scott , o\u2032 is Nathan, R is the\nproperty of running, and S is the relation of seeing. The\nnegation of (4) expresses the proposition\n\n(4b) <\u2009NEG,\n<\u2009<\u2009o\u2009>,\nR\u2009>\u2009>\n\n\nwhere NEG is the truth function for negation. And the conjunction of\n(4) and (5) (in that order) expresses the proposition\n\n(5b) <\u2009CONJ<\u2009\n<\u2009<\u2009o\u2009>, R\u2009>,\n<\u2009<\u2009o, o\u2032\u2009>,\nS\u2009>\u2009>\u2009>\n\n\nwhere CONJ is the truth function for conjunction. Similar remarks\napply to sentences formed with other truth functional connectives.\nFurther a sentence such as\n\n(6) Something\nruns.\n\n\nexpresses the proposition\n\n(6a) <\u2009SOME,\ng\u2009>\n\n\nwhere SOME is the property of being a nonempty set and g is the\nfunction from individuals o\u2032 to the proposition\n<\u2009<\u2009o\u2032\u2009>,\nR\u2009>, (where, as before, R is the property of\nrunning).\n\nIt should be easy to imagine the definition of truth relative to a\ncircumstance for structured propositions of the sort mentioned above.\nFor example, (5a) will be true at a circumstance c iff\n<\u2009o, o\u2032\u2009> is in the extension\nof the relation S at c. (5b) will be true at c\niff CONJ maps the truth values of\n<\u2009<\u2009o\u2009>, R\u2009> and\n<\u2009<\u2009o, o\u2032\u2009>,\nS\u2009> at c to truth. And (6a) will be true at\nc iff there is an individual in c that g maps to\na proposition that is true in c, (in that case the set of\nindividuals in c that g maps to propositions true in\nc possesses SOME).\n\nIt should be clear that on this account of propositions sentences that\nare necessarily equivalent may express distinct propositions, and that\nthe semantic values of expressions in a sentence are recoverable from\nthe proposition it expresses. For example, \u2018All bachelors are\nunmarried\u2019 and \u2018All brother are male\u2019 are both true\nin all possible worlds. But on the present view, the former expresses\na proposition that has as a constituent a propositional function\nmapping an object to the proposition that that object is unmarried;\nthe latter does not. Further, e.g. the semantic value of\n\u2018runs\u2019 as it occurs in sentence (4) is recoverable from\nthe proposition (4) expresses in that it is a constituent of that\nproposition. Similar remarks apply to 5/5a and 6/6a (except that in 6a\nthe semantic value of \u2018runs\u2019 is encoded in g: that\nis, g maps individuals o to the proposition that\no runs, which in turn has the semantic value of\n\u2018runs\u2019 as a constituent).\n\nNote that this account of propositions (including the commitment to\nnames being directly referential) entails that sentences that differ\nonly with respect to coreferential names express the same proposition.\nThus\n\nMark Twain is Samuel Clemens.\n\nand\n\nSamuel Clemens is Samuel Clemens.\n\nexpress the same proposition on this view. Many have found this result\nincredible, since it would appear that the one sentence could be\ninformative and the other not. Salmon and Soames also hold that\n\u2018believes\u2019 expresses a relation between individuals and\npropositions, so that \u2018Scott believes that Mark Twain is Samuel\nClemens\u2019 expresses a proposition to the effect Scott stands in\nthe believes relation to the proposition expressed by \u2018Mark\nTwain is Samuel Clemens\u2019. But then it follows that \u2018Scott\nbelieves that Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens\u2019 and \u2018Scott\nbelieves that Samuel Clemens is Samuel Clemens\u2019 express the same\nproposition (since the embedded sentences in both belief ascriptions\nexpress the same proposition) and so cannot diverge in truth value.\nMany have found this consequence of the Salmon-Soames view of\npropositions (and belief ascriptions) hard to swallow as well.\n\nSalmon [1986] is largely an extended defense of these two consequences\nof the Salmon-Soames view. It is beyond the scope of the present work\nto explain Salmon\u2019s defense and the interested reader should\nconsult that work\n directly.[7]\n Soames [2002] deals with these issues, among others, as well.\n\nIn the formal semantics offered by Salmon and Soames, propositions are\nordered n-tuples (or concatenations of n-tuples), as are\n(4a), (5a), (5b) etc. above. But since Salmon and Soames say nothing\nexplicitly about the matter, it is unclear whether these\nn-tuples and concatenations merely represent propositions in\nthe formalism, or whether Soames and Salmon take them to be\npropositions. If the former, then the Salmon and Soames view is\nincomplete and we need to be told what propositions really are, and\nmore specifically what it is that really holds propositions together\n(i.e. what the corner brackets in (4a), (5a) etc. stand for). If the\nlatter, then the view at least seems to have trouble accounting for\nsome of the properties possessed by propositions. Propositions have\ntruth conditions: they are true or false, depending on how the world\nis. So if some ordered n-tuples are propositions, some ordered\nn-tuples have truth conditions. But ordered n-tuples\ndon\u2019t seem to be the kinds of things that have truth conditions.\nIndeed, presumably many ordered n-tuples have no truth\nconditions, (e.g. <\u20091,2,3\u2009>). So how/why did those\nn-tuples that are propositions come to have truth conditions?\nSimilar remarks apply to modal properties. Propositions are necessary,\ncontingent, and possible. These, again, don\u2019t seem to be\nproperties of n-tuples. Finally, if propositions are ordered\nn-tuples, that is, set theoretic constructions, it is hard to\nsee why a particular set theoretic construction is the proposition in\nquestion (and so has truth conditions, modal properties, etc.) as\nopposed to some other set theoretic construction that seems equally\nwell suited to the task. For example, we said that the sentence\n\n(4) Scott\nruns.\n\n\nexpresses the proposition/set theoretic construction\n\n(4a) <\u2009<\u2009o\u2009>,\nR\u2009>\n\n\nBut the following set theoretic construction seems equally suited to\nbe the proposition (4) expresses:\n\n(4b) <\u2009R,\n<\u2009o\u2009>\u2009>\n\n\nSo why it is that (4a), instead of (4b), is the proposition (4)\nexpresses, and has modal properties and truth conditions? \n\nThese questions as to what holds structured propositions together and\ngives them their structure, and how/why proposition have truth\nconditions turns us to other recent work within the neo-Russellian\napproach. While adopting more or less the same view as Salmon and\nSoames on the semantic values of different kind of words (though\nclaiming to be strictly neutral on the question of what the semantic\nvalues of names and predicates are), Jeffrey C. King [1995, 1996,\n2007, 2009] develops a view as to what binds the constituents of\npropositions together and how/why propositions have truth conditions.\nHe holds that propositions are not n-tuples and that a complex\nrelation binds together the constituents of a proposition and provides\nthe proposition with its\n structure.[8]\n Further, King is motivated by the idea that propositions cannot be\nthe kinds of things that by their very natures and independently of\nminds and languages have truth conditions. Hence, a radical feature of\nKing\u2019s view is that we speakers of natural languages endow\npropositions with their truth conditions, as a result of which he\ncalls his account a naturalized account of propositions.\n\nIn order to explain what complex relation King claims binds the\nconstituents together, consider the sentence \u2018Dara swims\u2019\nand, idealizing considerably for the sake of exposition, assume that\nits syntactic structure at LF is as follows:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nCall the syntactic relation between \u2018Dara\u2019 and\n\u2018swims\u2019 here R. King sometimes calls R the\nsentential relation of the sentence \u2018Dara swims\u2019. Among\nthe reasons that the English sentence in Figure 1 is true iff Dara\nswims is that the sentential relation R is interpreted by\nEnglish speakers in a certain way. We interpret it as\nascribing the semantic value of \u2018swims\u2019 to the\nsemantic value of \u2018Dara\u2019. As King points out, this is a\ncontingent matter. There might have been a language containing the\nsentence \u2018Dara swims\u2019 the speakers of which took the\nsentence to be true iff Dara fails to possess the property of\n swimming.[9]\n The difference in truth conditions of the sentence \u2018Dara\nswims\u2019 in these two languages is due to the speakers of the\nlanguages interpreting the syntactic concatenation in the sentence\ndifferently. And of course we English speakers interpreting R\nin the way we do (described above) is not an isolated matter. In\ngeneral we interpret syntactic concatenation by composing semantic\nvalues of the concatenated lexical items in certain\n ways.[10]\n King sometimes puts this by saying that we interpret syntactic\nconcatenation as instructing us to compose semantic values in certain\nways. The fact that R in Figure 1 is interpreted by English\nspeakers as ascribing the semantic value of \u2018swims\u2019 to the\nsemantic value of \u2018Dara\u2019 is expressed by saying that in\nEnglish, R encodes\n ascription.[11]\n It is the fact that R encodes ascription in English that makes\nthe English sentence \u2018Dara swims\u2019 have truth conditions\nrather than being a list of Dara and the property of\n swimming.[12]\n\nReturning to the main theme, we are trying to say what relation holds\ntogether Dara and the property of swimming in the proposition that\nDara swims on King\u2019s view. King claims that we ought to be sure\nthat we pick a relation such that there are good independent grounds\nfor thinking that Dara and the property really do stand in that\nrelation, so that the proposition in question exists. Given that\n\u2018Dara\u2019 has Dara as its semantic value and that\n\u2018swims\u2019 has the property of swimming as its semantic\nvalue, then in virtue of the existence of the English sentence\n\u2018Dara swims\u2019, here is a two-place relation that Dara and\nthe property of swimming stand in:\n\n(Relation)\n\nthere is a language L, a context c and lexical items a and b of L\nsuch that a and b occur at the left and right terminal nodes\n(respectively) of the sentential relation R that in L encodes\nascription and ___ is the semantic value of a in c and ___ is the\nsemantic value of b in c.\n\nFollowing King, let\u2019s call an object possessing a property, or\nn objects standing in an n-place relation, or an object\nstanding in a relation to a property, or n properties standing\nin an n-place relation and so on a fact. Then since Dara stands\nin the above relation to the property of swimming, the following is a\nfact:\n\n(Fact)\n\nthere is a language L, a context c and lexical items a and b of L\nsuch that a and b occur at the left and right terminal nodes\n(respectively) of the sentential relation R that in L encodes\nascription and Dara is the semantic value of a in c and the property\nof swimming is the semantic value of b in c.\n\nThat the English sentence \u2018Dara swims\u2019 exists, that\n\u2018Dara\u2019 has as its semantic value (in any context) Dara and\nthat \u2018swims\u2019 has as its semantic value (in any context)\nthe property of swimming jointly suffice for the existence of this\nfact. Equally, that the German sentence \u2018Dara schwimmt\u2019\nexists (and that the words in the sentence have the semantic values in\ncontext that they do) and that the English sentence \u2018I\nswim\u2019 taken in a context in which Dara is the speaker exists\neach suffices for the existence of this fact as well. Without the\nexistence of any such sentences, the fact in question wouldn\u2019t\nexist.\n\n(Fact), or what is the same thing, Dara standing in (Relation) to the\nproperty of swimming, is almost what King claims is the proposition\nthat Dara swims. To see what more needs to be added, note that there\nis no reason to think that (Fact) has truth conditions and so is\neither true or false. But consider again (Relation), which relates\nDara and the property of swimming in (Fact). Since Dara stands in\n(Relation) to the property of swimming in the proposition that Dara\nswims, call (Relation) the propositional relation of the proposition\nthat Dara swims. Now if this propositional relation encoded\nascription, as does the sentential relation R that is a component of\nthe propositional relation, the proposition would have truth\nconditions. For in that case, the propositional relation would be\ninterpreted as ascribing the property of swimming to Dara and so the\nproposition would be true iff Dara possesses the property of\n swimming.[13]\n Hence, King claims that the following fact is the proposition that\nDara swims, where we now include as part of the fact/proposition that\nthe propositional relation in it encodes ascription: there is a\nlanguage L, a context c and lexical items a and b of L such that a and\nb occur at the left and right terminal nodes (respectively) of the\nsentential relation R that in L encodes ascription and Dara is the\nsemantic value of a in c and the property of swimming is the semantic\nvalue of b in\n c.[14]\n Since Dara does possess the property of swimming, there is also the\nfact of her possessing this property. But note that this fact is quite\ndistinct from the fact that King claims is the proposition that Dara\nswims. Still, the former makes the latter true. But had there been no\nfact of Dara possessing the property of swimming, the fact that is the\nproposition that Dara swims would still have existed and sadly would\nhave been\n false.[15]\n\nKing claims that his account has several significant\n virtues.[16]\n First, on his account it is hard to deny that propositions exist\ngiven fairly minimal assumptions; and there is no mystery about what\nthey are. Second, his theory is naturalized, in the sense that it is\nsomething we do that endows propositions with truth\nconditions. Third, and related to the previous point, we can give some\nexplanation as to how and why propositions have truth\n conditions.[17]\n On the proposed explanation the representational powers of sentences\nand their users are explanatorily prior to those of propositions.\n\nIn more recent work, King has emended his account of propositions in\nvarious ways. On King\u2019s [2007] view, because of the role the\nsyntax of a sentence plays in the propositional relation expressed by\nthe proposition it expresses, sentences with any difference in their\nsyntactic structures express different proposition. However, in both\nKing, Speaks, & Soames [2014] and especially in King [2018], King\nformulates a version of his view that allows sentences with quite\ndifferent syntactic structures, whether in the same or different\nlanguages, to express the same proposition. In King, Speaks, &\nSoames [2014], King gives his most explicit account to date of how it\nis that propositions have truth conditions and so represent the world\nas being a certain\n way.[18]\n\n\nFinally, we turn to a discussion of a view of propositions recently\nchampioned by Scott Soames [2010a, 2010b]. Soames follows King [2007,\n2009] in rejecting the view that propositions are things that are\nrepresentational, and so have truth conditions, independently of minds\nand languages on the grounds that such a view is ultimately mysterious\nand unintelligible. Again following King, Soames thinks that the fact\nthat propositions are representational must ultimately be explained in\nterms of the representational capacities of agents. However,\nSoames\u2019 positive account of how/why propositions have truth\nconditions differs in important ways from King\u2019s.\n\nSoames begins with the notion of the mental act of predication, which\nhe takes to be primitive. However, by way of illustration, if an agent\nperceives an object o as red, and so has a perceptual\nexperience that represents o as being red, the agent\npredicates redness of o. Similarly, if an agent\n\u201cthinks of\u201d o as\n red[19],\n or \u201cform[s] the nonlinguistic perceptual belief that\no is\n red\u201d.[20]\n For Soames, predicating redness of o does not amount to\nbelieving that o is red. To believe that o is red, one\nmust predicate redness of o and do something like endorse the\npredication. It is hard to say precisely what predicating\namounts to since the notion is primitive for Soames. An agent\npredicating redness of o is an event token. Of course there may\nwell be many event tokens of agents predicating redness of some object\no by an agent perceiving it as red, an agent thinking of it as\nred and so on. Soames claims that the proposition that o is red\nis the event type of an agent predicating redness of\no. Other more complex propositions are identified with events\ntypes of agents performing sequences of primitive mental\n acts.[21]\n Soames doesn\u2019t say what he takes events (types or tokens) to\nbe. But since he thinks that propositions are structured entities with\nconstituents, he must think that event types are structured entities\nwith constituents. Presumably, the proposition that o is\nred\u2014the event type of an agent predicating redness of\no\u2014has o and redness as constituents. \n\nLike King, Soames grounds the representational capacities of\npropositions in the representational capacities of agents. Soames\nclaims that the event tokens of agents ascribing redness to o\nare things that inherently have truth conditions. They are things that\nare inherently true iff o is red. These tokens are for Soames\ntokens of the event type that is the proposition that o is red:\nthe event type of an agent predicating redness of o. Soames\nclaims that the event type that o is red has truth conditions\nbecause of its \u201cintrinsic connection\u201d to the event tokens\nof agents predicating redness of o, which, as indicated, are\nthemselves things that inherently have truth conditions.\n\nIn King, Speaks, & Soames [2014] and Soames [forthcoming], Soames\namends his theory of proposition in several respects. Two of those\nchanges are the following. First, Soames [2010] had rejected the view\nthat cognitive act types are propositions on the grounds that act type\nare things that we do, but propositions are not. In King, Speaks,\n& Soames [2014], Soames makes clear that he no longer finds this\nargument persuasive and is inclined to identify propositions with\ncognitive act types. Second, Soames gives a new account represent\nthings as being a certain way. On the new account, propositions\nrepresent things as being a certain way in a derivative sense. Just as\nan act can be intelligent in the derivative sense that in performing\nit an agent is acting intelligently, the proposition that o is red\nrepresents in the derivative sense that in performing that act an\nagent represents o as being red. \n\nPeter Hanks [2015] defends a view with some similarities to\nSoames\u2019 view discussed above. As did Soames, Hanks follows King\nin endorsing the three novel claims from King [2007] and subsequent\nwork mentioned above: (i) Hanks rejects theories according to which\npropositions have truth conditions and so represent the world as being\na certain way by their very natures and independently of minds and\nlanguages as mysterious; (ii) holds that an adequate theory of\npropositions must explain how\\why propositions have truth\nconditions and so represent the world as being a certain way; (iii)\nand holds that since the representational capacities of propositions\ncannot be something they have inherently and by their natures, their\nrepresentational capacities must derive from and be explained by the\nrepresentational capacities of thinking agents. \n\nIn simple cases of judging and asserting, Hanks claims we perform\nactions of predicating properties of objects. In judging that Donald\nTrump is a demagogue without speaking, one thinks of Trump (refers to\nhim in thought), thinks of the property of being a demagogue\n(expresses the property in thought) and predicates the property of\nTrump. In asserting that Trump is a demagogue, one refers to him,\nexpresses the property and predicates it of him, here using linguistic\nmeans. According to Hanks, in predicating a property of an object, one\nportrays the object as being a certain way and so does something that\nis true or false. Hence, Hanks claims these token acts of predicating\nare true or false. Hanks notion of predication is inherently assertive\nand committing, unlike Soames\u2019 notion of predication. There is\nnot some non-committal thing you do in predicating and then add\nendorsement or commitment. On Hanks view, predicating is\ncommitting to the object possessing the property in question. The\nproposition that Donald Trump is a demagogue is the act type of\npredicating being a demagogue of Trump. Hanks holds that this\nact type would exist even if it had no tokens. In general, whether\nthey have tokens or not, Hanks holds that the act types that are\npropositions exist. \n\nThe proposition that Trump is a demagogue is the act type of referring\nto Trump, expressing the property of being a demagogue and predicating\nit of Trump, as we have seen. What Hanks calls the interrogative\nproposition expressible by the question \u2018Is Trump a\ndemagogue?\u2019 is the act type of referring to Trump, expressing\nthe property of being a demagogue and combining Trump and the property\nin an interrogative way (rather than predicating the property\nof Trump). Hanks gives a similar account of the imperative\nproposition expressed by the command \u2018Trump, be a\ndemagogue!\u2019 As a result, Hanks rejects the claim that there is\nsome common underlying content running through the (assertive)\nproposition, imperative proposition and interrogative proposition\nregarding Trump being a demagogue. There are just three different\npropositions here with their different \u201cforces\u201d\n(assertive, interrogative, imperative) built in. \n\nHanks\u2019 explanation of why propositions as act types of the sort\ndescribed have truth conditions comes in two steps. First, Hanks\nargues that token acts of predicating properties of objects have truth\nconditions. Hanks recognizes that some may doubt whether act tokens\nare the kinds of things that can be true and false. His main argument\nthat they can be is that we have adverbial modifiers\n\u2018truly\u2019 and \u2018falsely\u2019 and that these attribute\nproperties to action tokens. So just as \u2018quickly\u2019 in\n\u2018Obama quickly stated that Clinton is eloquent.\u2019\nattributes a property to Obamas\u2019s action, so Hanks claims that\n\u2018truly\u2019 in \u2018Obama truly stated that Clinton is\neloquent.\u2019 attributes the property of being true to an action of\nObama. Hanks then tries to argue that the action type of\npredicating being a demagogue of Cruz inherits the property of having\ntruth conditions from its instances. Note that here it must be actual\nand possible instances that truth conditions are inherited from, since\nHanks wants propositions that have never been and never will be\ntokened to have truth conditions. The argument here is complex since\nHanks notes that types inherit certain kinds of properties from tokens\nand not others. Hence, Hanks seeks to explain why the having of truth\nconditions is the kind of property a type inherits from its (actual\nand possible) tokens. \n\nOn Hanks\u2019 theory there are many more propositions than one might\nhave thought. First, there is the proposition that is the act type\nconsisting of referring to Clinton using \u2018Clinton\u2019 and\npredicating eloquence of her. It is true iff Clinton is eloquent. Then\nthere is a distinct proposition with those same truth conditions that\nis the act of referring to Clinton in any way whatsoever and\npredicating eloquence of her. Next, there is another proposition with\nthese same truth conditions consisting of the act of referring to\nClinton using \u2018Clinton\u2019 while thinking of her as\nObama\u2019s former secretary of state and predicating eloquence of\nher. In addition, there is another proposition with the same truth\nconditions consisting of referring to Clinton using\n\u2018Clinton\u2019 while thinking of her as a former first lady and\npredicating eloquence of her. And so on. Again, all these propositions\nare true iff Clinton is eloquent. There is even a proposition\nconsisting of referring to Clinton using \u2018Clinton\u2019 while\ndrawing a round square and predicating eloquence of her.\n [22]\n\n\nAbove we saw that for Hanks, predication endows propositions with an\ninherent element of judgment or assertion. Predicating a property of\nan object commits the predicator to the object having that\nproperty. For Hanks, she did something false if it doesn\u2019t. But\nthis raises a problem for him. In disjunctive, negated, conditional\npropositions and others, embedded propositions do not have assertive\nforce. They aren\u2019t asserted. But if these embedded propositions\ninherently have an assertoric or judgmental element, how can this be?\nTo address this Hanks claims that \u2018or\u2019, \u2018if\u2019\nand \u2018not\u2019 create cancellation contexts. Since e.g.\n\u2018or\u2019 creates a cancellation context on Hanks\u2019\nview, in uttering the following sentence I fail to assert that Trump\nis a demagogue:\n\nTrump is a demagogue or Clinton is eloquent. \n\nEach disjunct expresses a proposition that includes as a sub act the\nact of predicating a property of the object according to Hanks. But\nthe predication is cancelled. Hence, the asserting/committing element\nin the proposition is cancelled. Hanks must walk a very fine line\nhere. The inherently assertive committal aspect of predication is what\nexplains both that propositions are true and false and that unembedded\npropositions make\n assertions.[23]\n To explain why some embedded propositions don\u2019t make\nassertions, Hanks appeals to the notion of the predication being\ncancelled in virtue of occurring in a cancellation context. But of\ncourse Hanks will want to say that the embedded proposition still has\ntruth conditions and is true or false. Somehow in canceling the\npredication, though assertive force is cancelled the truth conditions\nand truth-value aren\u2019t, even though predication is responsible\nfor both. \n\nAbove it was mentioned that King [2007] and subsequent work endorsed\nthree novel claims about propositions. Two of these are: (i) theories\naccording to which propositions have truth conditions and so represent\nthe world as being a certain way by their very natures and\nindependently of minds and languages are mysterious and to be\nrejected; (ii) an adequate theory of propositions must explain\nhow\\why propositions have truth conditions and so represent the world\nas being a certain\n way.[24]\n It was also noted that Soames and Hanks follow King in this respect.\nIn a sense, Speaks does too insofar as he feels the need to explain\nthe \u201caboutness\u201d or intentionality of some mental\n states.[25]\n So most recent literature has taken onboard King\u2019s two claims\nabove. Philosophy being what it is, however, there have been recent\ntheorists who want to return to something like the classical theories\nof Frege and Russell, where propositions were thought to be mind and\nlanguage independent abstract objects that by their very natures had\ntruth conditions and so represent the world as being a certain way. On\nsuch a view, both of King\u2019s claims are rejected. Propositions\nare precisely held to have truth conditions by their natures and\nindependently of minds and languages; and it is denied that there can\nbe any explanation of how/why propositions have truth conditions.\nTrenton Merricks [2015] defends such a view. According to Merricks,\npropositions are abstract, necessary existents that essentially\nrepresent the world as being a certain\n way.[26]\n He also holds that the fact that propositions essentially represent\nthings as being a certain way is primitive. That is, this fact has no\n explanation.[27]\n Further, Merricks holds that propositions are simple: they have no\n constituents.[28]\n On this last point at least Merricks departs from the classical views\nof Frege and Russell on which propositions do have constituents. \n\nLorraine Juliano Keller [2014] expresses sympathy for a similar view\nthat she calls propositional primitivism. On this view,\npropositions are fine-grained sui generis entities. They are\nnot reducible to nor can they be explained by entities in another\nontological category. Her primitivist thinks that not much of anything\ncan be said about the inner nature of propositions except that they\nare abstract, mind and language independent entities with no\nconstituents or structure. While King, Soames, Hanks and perhaps\nSpeaks see in such a view mystery or worse, primitivists like Keller\nand Merricks see elegance and simplicity. \n",
