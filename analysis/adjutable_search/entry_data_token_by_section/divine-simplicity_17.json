    "main_text": "The Modal Collapse Objection to DDS || Terminology and Terrain\n7.2 Terminology and Terrain\n\nTo begin, some terminology and a rough map of the aporetic terrain.\nTerminological regimentation in excess of that already provided in\nthis entry is necessary to bring MCA into proper focus, especially\ngiven the need to accommodate Islamic Neoplatonist responses to the\nproblem. A traditional theist is one whose definition of\n\u2018God\u2019 includes omniscience, omnipotence, omnibenevolence,\nnecessary existence, and being the creator of every concrete item\ndistinct from itself, but does not include or exclude DDS. Traditional\ntheists thus divide into those who accept, and those who reject DDS. A\ntraditional theist who accepts DDS may be termed a classical\ntheist. Classical theists divide into those who accept and those\nwho reject the modal contingency of concrete creatures. An item is\nmodally contingent just in case both its existence and its\nnonexistence are broadly logically possible. The modally contingent is\nnot the same as the existentially dependent. For creatures are\nexistentially dependent on God but need not be modally contingent.\nSo-called abstract objects (the denizens of the Platonic menagerie\nsuch as numbers and mathematical sets) are modally necessary beings\nand yet they are plausibly taken to be creatures in the sense that if,\nper impossibile, God did not exist, then they would not exist\neither. They depend on God for their existence despite their modal\nnecessity. They exist in every (metaphysically or broadly logically)\npossible world and they depend on God for their existence in every\nsuch possible world. The modally contingent and that which is\nexistentially dependent on God are therefore notionally or\nconceptually distinct. A concrete creature is any creature\nthat is not abstract, in the way \u2018abstract\u2019 is (mis)used\nby contemporary analytic philosophers to cover the inhabitants of the\nPlatonic menagerie.\n\nThe classical theists who accept both DDS and the modal contingency of\nconcrete creatures further divide into those who maintain that the MCA\ncan be successfully answered by showing that the limbs of the\nproblematic dyad mentioned above are logically consistent, and those\nwho maintain that the MCA cannot be successfully answered but that,\nnevertheless, both the simplicity limb and the contingency limb are to\nbe accepted. Among those for whom the MCA can be successfully rebutted\nwe find Greeley (2019), Nemes (2020), Schmid (2022), and Waldrop\n(2022) et al. Among those who for whom the MCA cannot be successfully\nrebutted but who nevertheless embrace both limbs of the problematic\ndyad we find the mysterian Dolezal (2011). See section 4.3 above.\n\nThe classical theists who accept DDS but reject the modal contingency\nof concrete creatures turn aside the MCA by rejecting the contingency\nlimb of the problematic dyad. Among them we find both Christian and\nnon-Christian classical theists. An Islamic Neoplatonist\ntheist is a classical theist who upholds DDS but does not uphold the\nmodal contingency of concrete creatures. Such a non-Christian\nclassical theist takes an emanationist approach to divine creation. On\nemanationism, as we find it in Ibn Sina (Avicenna), for example, God\neternally and necessarily brings into existence things wholly distinct\nfrom himself and in such a way that the things created share in the\nmodal necessity of the Creator and his creative will despite the\nexistential dependence of the creatures upon the Creator. (Andani,\n2022, 11) More on the Islamic Neoplatonist view below. There are also\nChristian classical theists who accept DDS but reject the modal\ncontingency of concrete creatures, affirming instead their\nhypothetical necessity. (Pedersen and Lilley 2022) Both types of\nclassical theist who accept DDS but reject the modal contingency of\nconcrete creatures exploit the putative distinction between absolute\n(unconditional) and hypothetical (conditional) necessity. God alone\nexists of absolute metaphysical necessity in se; creatures\nare necessary ab alio, from another, namely, from God. This\nhypothetical necessity holds for both abstract and concrete\ncreatures.\n\nFinally, we have those traditional theists who reject DDS but accept\nthe modal contingency of creatures. Among them we find Moreland and\nCraig (2003), Plantinga (1980), and Hasker (2016).\n\nThe assumption thus far is that the MCA is a (genuine) problem for\nclassical theists who accept the modal contingency of concrete\ncreatures in the sense that the MCA does not arise from some easily\ndetectable fallacy, confusion, or misuse of language. Tomaszewski\n(2019), however, alleges that the MCA in all variants succumbs to one\nor more modal fallacies. This charge has not held up well under\nscrutiny. Waldrop (2022) shows convincingly that at least three\nvariants of the MCA are free of logical error, the variants of\nMoreland and Craig (2003), Leftow (2015), and Mullins (2016).\n",
