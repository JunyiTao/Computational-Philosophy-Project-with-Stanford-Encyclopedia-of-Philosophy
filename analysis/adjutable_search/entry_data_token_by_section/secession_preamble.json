    "main_text": "\n\n\nUntil fairly recently, secession has been a neglected topic among\nphilosophers. Two factors may explain why philosophers have now begun\nto turn their attention to secession. First, in the past few decades\nthere has been a great increase not only in the number of attempted\nsecessions, but also in successful secessions, and philosophers may\nsimply be reacting to this new reality, attempting to make normative\nsense of it. The reasons for the frequency of attempts to secede are\ncomplex, but there are two recent developments that make the prospect\nof state-breaking more promising: improvement in national security and\nliberalization of trade. As the fear of forcible annexation diminishes\nand trade barriers fall, smaller states become feasible, and\nindependent statehood looks more feasible for regions within states.\nSecond, in roughly the same time period, the idea that there is a\nstrong case for some form of self-government for groups presently\ncontained within states has gained ground. Once one begins to take\nseriously the case for special group rights for\nminorities\u2014especially if these include rights of\nself-government\u2014it is difficult to avoid the question of whether\nsome such groups may be entitled to full independence.\n",
