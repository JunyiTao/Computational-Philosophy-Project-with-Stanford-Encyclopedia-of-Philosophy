    "main_text": "Applications || Sentiment analysis\n10.4 Sentiment analysis\n\nSentiment analysis refers to the detection of positive or negative\nattitudes (or more specific attitudes such as belief or contempt) on\nthe part of authors of articles or blogs towards commercial products,\nfilms, organizations, persons, ideologies, etc. This has become a very\nactive area of applied computational linguistics, because of its\npotential importance for product marketing and ranking, social network\nanalysis, political and intelligence analysis, classification of\npersonality types or disorders based on writing samples, and other\nareas. The techniques used are typically based on sentiment lexicons\nthat classify the affective polarity of vocabulary items, and on\nsupervised machine learning applied to texts from which word and\nphrasal features have been extracted and that have been hand-labeled\nas expressing positive or negative attitudes towards some\ntheme. Instead of manual labeling, existing data can sometimes be used\nto provide a priori classification information. For example,\naverage numerical ratings of consumer products or movies produced by\nbloggers may be used to learn to classify unrated materials belonging\nto the same or similar genres. If fact, affective lexical categories\nand contrast relations may be learnable from such data; for example,\nfrequent occurrences of phrases such as great movie\nor pretty good movie or terrible movie in blogs\nconcerning movies with high, medium, and low average ratings may well\nsuggest that great, pretty good, and\nterrible belong to a contrast spectrum ranging from a very\npositive to a very negative polarity. Such terminological knowledge\ncan in turn boost the coverage of generic sentiment lexicons. However,\nsentiment analysis based on lexical and phrasal features has obvious\nlimitations, such as obliviousness to sarcasm and irony ( \u201cThis\nis the most subtle and sensitive movie since The Texas Chainsaw\nMassacre\u201d), quotation of opinions contrasting with the author's\n(\u201cAccording to the ads, Siri is the greatest app since iTunes,\nbut in fact \u2026\u201d), and lack of understanding of entailments\n(\u201cYou'll be much better off buying a pair of woolen undies for\nthe winter than purchasing this item\u201d). Thus researchers are\nattempting to integrate knowledge-based and semantic analysis with\nsuperficial word- and phrase-based sentiment analysis.\n\n",
