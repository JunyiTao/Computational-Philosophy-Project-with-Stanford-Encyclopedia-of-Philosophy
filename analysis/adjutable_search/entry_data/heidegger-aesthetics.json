In this way, as we will see,\nHeidegger seeks to show how art can help lead us into a genuinely\nmeaningful postmodern age.

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction to \u201cHeidegger\u2019s Aesthetics\u201d:  Beyond the Oxymoron\n\n\nPerhaps the first thing to be said about \u201cHeidegger\u2019s\naesthetics\u201d is that Heidegger himself would consider the very\ntopic oxymoronic, a contradiction in terms like the idea of a\n\u201csquare circle,\u201d \u201cwooden iron,\u201d or a\n\u201cChristian philosopher\u201d (Heidegger\u2019s own three\nfavorite examples of\n oxymorons).[1]\nTreating Heidegger\u2019s\nthinking about art as \u201caesthetics\u201d would strike him as\nincongruous and inappropriate because he consistently insisted that the\n\u201caesthetic\u201d approach has led Western humanity to understand\nand experience the work of art in a way that occludes its true\nhistorical significance. Nor can Heidegger\u2019s thinking be\nsympathetically classified as \u201canti-aesthetic,\u201d because he\nsuggests that any such anti-aesthetics would remain blindly entangled\nin aesthetics (in the same way that, for example, atheism remains\nimplicated in the logic of theism\u2014both claiming to know the\nunknowable); in his view, any merely oppositional movement remains\ntrapped in the logic of what it opposes (QCT 61/GA5 217). For\nHeidegger, as we will see, the only way to get beyond aesthetics is\nfirst to understand how it shapes us and then seek to pass through and\nbeyond that influence, thereby getting over it as one might\n\u201crecover\u201d from a serious illness (ID 37/101). Because\nthe aesthetic approach continues to eclipse our access to the role\nartworks can quietly play in forming and informing our historical\nworlds, Heidegger thinks that only such a post-aesthetic thinking about\nart can allow us to recognize and restore art\u2019s true\nsignificance, helping us recognize the inconspicuous way in which art\nworks to shape our basic sense of what is and what\n matters.[2]\n\n\nFrom a strictly Heideggerian perspective, then, any attempt to\nexplain \u201cHeidegger\u2019s aesthetics\u201d (or his\n\u201canti-aesthetics\u201d) will look either malicious or\nmisconceived, like a deliberate flaunting or else an unwitting\ndisplay of ignorance about the basic tenets of Heidegger\u2019s views\non art. Fortunately, our starting point is not really so\nmisconceived. Once we understand why exactly Heidegger\ncriticizes (what we could call) the aestheticization of\nart, we will thereby have put ourselves on the right track to\nunderstanding his own post-aesthetic thinking about the work of\nart. (We should not confuse the aestheticization Heidegger\ncritiques with \u201caestheticism,\u201d a term standardly taken to\nrefer to the \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d\n movement.[3]\nFor\nHeidegger, any such attempt to disconnect art from politics,\nphilosophy, and other history-shaping movements would not even be\nthinkable without the prior reduction of art to aesthetics that he\ncriticizes.) So, what exactly is supposed to be wrong with the\naestheticization of art? What leads Heidegger to critique the\ndominant modern tradition that understands art in an\n\u201caesthetic\u201d way, and why does he believe this aesthetic\napproach eclipses the true significance of the work of art?\n1.1 Heidegger\u2019s Understanding of the True Work of Art\n\n\nTo understand Heidegger\u2019s critique of aesthetics, it will help\nfirst to sketch his positive view of art\u2019s true historical\nrole. Heidegger\u2019s own understanding of the work of art is\nresolutely populist but with revolutionary aspirations. He\nbelieves that, at its greatest, art \u201cgrounds history\u201d by\n\u201callowing truth to spring forth\u201d (PLT 77/GA5\n 65).[4]\nBuilding on\nHeraclitus\u2019s view of the pervasive tension of normative\nconceptual oppositions (good/bad, worthy/worthless, noble/base, and the\nlike) that undergird and implicitly structure our sense of ourselves\nand our worlds, Heidegger imagines the way\n an ancient Greek temple at Paestum\n once worked to help unify its historical world by tacitly\n reinforcing a particular sense of what is and what matters:\n\n\nIt is the temple-work that first joins together and simultaneously\ngathers around itself the unity of those paths and relations in which\nbirth and death, disaster and blessing, victory and disgrace, endurance\nand decline obtain the form of destiny for human being. \u2026The\ntemple first gives to things their look and to humanity their outlook\non themselves. (PLT 42\u20133/GA5 27\u20139)\n\n\nGreat art works work in the background of our historical\nworlds, in other words, by partially embodying and so selectively\nreinforcing an historical community\u2019s implicit sense of what is\nand what matters. In this way, great artworks both (1)\n\u201cfirst give to things their look,\u201d that is, they help\nestablish an historical community\u2019s implicit sense of what things\nare, and they give (2) \u201cto humanity their outlook on\nthemselves,\u201d that is, they also help shape an historical\ncommunity\u2019s implicit sense of what truly matters in life\n(and so also what does not), which kinds of lives are most worth living, which\nactions are \u201cnoble\u201d (or \u201cbase\u201d), what in the\ncommunity\u2019s traditions most deserves to be preserved, and so\non.\n\n\nAs this suggests, Heidegger subscribes to a doctrine of\nontological historicity (refining a view first developed by\nHegel). Put simply, Heidegger thinks that humanity\u2019s\nfundamental experience of reality changes over time (sometimes\ndramatically), and he suggests that the work of art helps\nexplain the basic mechanism of this historical transformation\nof\n intelligibility.[5]\nBecause great art works\ninconspicuously to establish, maintain, and transform humanity\u2019s\nhistorically-variable sense of what is and what matters, Heidegger\nemphasizes that \u201cart is the becoming and happening of\ntruth\u201d (PLT 71/GA5 59). Put simply, great artworks\nhelp establish the implicit ontology and ethics through which an\nhistorical community understands itself and its\n world.[6]\nIn keeping with this\n(initially strange) doctrine of ontological historicity, Heidegger\nunderstands \u201ctruth\u201d ontologically as the\nhistorically-dynamic disclosure of intelligibility in time. As we\nwill see in section 3, this historical unfolding of truth takes\nplace\u2014to use Heidegger\u2019s preferred philosophical terms of\nart\u2014as an \u201ca-l\u00eatheiac\u201d struggle to\n\u201cdis-close\u201d or \u201cun-conceal\u201d\n(a-l\u00eatheia) that which conceals (l\u00eathe)\nitself, an \u201cessential strife\u201d between two interconnected\ndimensions of intelligibility (revealing and concealing) which\nHeidegger calls \u201cworld\u201d and \u201cearth\u201d in his most\nfamous work on art.\n\n\nIn sum, great art works by selectively focusing an\nhistorical community\u2019s tacit sense of what is and what matters\nand reflecting it back to that community, which thereby comes\nimplicitly to understand itself in the light of this artwork.\nArtworks thus function as ontological paradigms, serving their\ncommunities both as \u201cmodels of\u201d and \u201cmodels\nfor\u201d reality, which means (as Dreyfus nicely puts it) that\nartworks can variously \u201cmanifest,\u201d\n\u201carticulate,\u201d or even \u201creconfigure\u201d the\nhistorical ontologies undergirding their cultural\n worlds.[7]\nHeidegger\nsuggests, in other words, that art can accomplish its world-disclosing\nwork on at least three different orders of magnitude: (1)\nmicro-paradigms he will later calls \u201cthings thinging,\u201d\nwhich help us become aware of what matters most deeply to us; (2)\nparadigmatic artworks like Van Gogh\u2019s painting and\nH\u00f6lderlin\u2019s poetry, which disclose how art itself works; and\n(3) macro-paradigmatic \u201cgreat\u201d works of art like the Greek\ntemple and tragic drama (works Heidegger also sometimes calls\n\u201cgods\u201d), which succeed in fundamentally transforming an\nhistorical community\u2019s \u201cunderstanding of being,\u201d its\nmost basic and ultimate understanding of what is and what\n matters.[8]\n\n\nIt is with this ontologically revolutionary potential of great art\nin mind that Heidegger writes:\n\n\nWhenever [great] art happens\u2014that is, when there is a\nbeginning\u2014a push enters history, and history either starts up or\nstarts again. (PLT 77/GA5 65)\n\n\nThat is, great art is capable of overcoming the inertia of existing\ntraditions and moving the interconnected ontological and ethical wheels\nof history, either giving us a new sense of what is and what matters or\nelse fundamentally transforming the established ontology and ethics\nthrough which we make sense of the world and\n ourselves.[9]\nGiven Heidegger\u2019s\nview of the literally revolutionary role art can thus play in\ninconspicuously shaping and transforming our basic sense of what is and\nwhat matters, his occasionally ill-tempered critiques of the reduction\nof art to aesthetics become much easier to understand. For, in\nhis view, the stakes of our understanding of and approach to art could\nnot be higher.\n2. Heidegger\u2019s Philosophical Critique of Aesthetics: Introduction\n\n\nHeidegger believes that the aestheticization of art has gotten us\nlate moderns stuck in the rarefied and abstract view according to which\n\u201cthe enjoyment of art serves [primarily] to satisfy the refined\ntaste of connoisseurs and aesthetes.\u201d Hence his amusing but\nharsh judgment that: \u201cFor us today, \u2026art belongs in\nthe domain of the pastry chef\u201d (IM 140/GA40 140). That our\nculture blithely celebrates caf\u00e9 baristas who compete over the\n\u201cart\u201d of pouring foamed milk into our cappuccinos suggests\nthat we have lost sight of the role art can play in shaping history at\nthe deepest level, an ontologically revolutionary role compared to\nwhich Heidegger finds the \u201cartful\u201d gestures of culinary\nexpertise rather empty.\n\n\nFor the same reason, Heidegger is no more impressed by Kant\u2019s highbrow\nview that the disinterested contemplation of art should \u201cserve\nthe moral elevation of the mind\u201d (IM 140/GA40\n 140).[10]\nInstead, Heidegger is clearly sympathetic to the\n\u201ccomplaint\u201d that, as he puts it:\n\n\ninnumerable aesthetic considerations of and investigations into art\nand the beautiful have achieved nothing, they have not helped anyone\ngain access to art, and they have contributed virtually nothing to\nartistic creativity or to a sound appreciation of art. (N1\n79/GA43 92)\n\n\nHeidegger would thus agree with the sentiment behind Barnet\nNewman\u2019s famous quip: \u201cAesthetics is for the artist\nas ornithology is for the\n birds.\u201d[11]\nStill, for Heidegger such complaints,\nwhile \u201ccertainly right,\u201d are really only symptomatic of a\nmuch deeper philosophical problem, a problem which stems from the way\nmodern aesthetics is rooted in the subject/object divide lying at the\nvery heart of the modern worldview. In order to get to the heart\nof the problem, then, we need to take a step back and ask: How\n exactly does Heidegger understand\n aesthetics?[12]\n2.1 How Heidegger Understands Aesthetics\n\n\nAs Heidegger points out, the term \u201caesthetics\u201d is a\nmodern creation. It was coined by Alexander Baumgarten in the\n1750s and then critically appropriated by Kant in his Critique of\nJudgment (published in\n 1790).[13]\nBaumgarten formed the term\n\u201caesthetics\u201d from the Greek word for\n\u201csensation\u201d or \u201cfeeling,\u201d\naisth\u00easis (N1 83/GA43 98). As this indicates,\nmodern \u201caesthetics\u201d was originally conceived as the science\nof aisth\u00eata, matters perceptible by the senses, as\nopposed to no\u00eama, matters accessible to thought alone,\nlike the truths dealt with in mathematical logic. In fact, modern\naesthetics is born of the aspiration to be \u201cin the field of\nsensuousness what logic is in the domain of thinking\u201d (N1 83/GA43\n98). That is, just as logic (conceived as the science of thought)\nseeks to understand our relation to the true, so aesthetics (conceived\nas the science of sensation or feeling) seeks to understand our\nrelation to the\n beautiful.[14]\n\n\nTo recognize that the central focus of modern aesthetics is beauty\nis not to deny its traditional interest in the sublime or its\nlate-modern preoccupations with the abject, the obscene, kitsch, and so\non. Heidegger\u2019s point, rather, is that\n\n\naesthetics is that kind of meditation on art in which\nhumanity\u2019s state of feeling in relation to the beautiful\nrepresented in art is the point of departure and the goal that sets the\nstandard for all its definitions and explanations. (N1 78/GA43\n91)\n\n\nIn its paradigmatic form (the form \u201cthat sets the\nstandard\u201d for all its other \u201cdefinitions and\nexplanations\u201d), modern \u201caesthetics is the consideration of\nhumanity\u2019s state of feeling in relation to the beautiful\u201d\n(N1 78/GA43 90).\n\n\nHeidegger is not denying that there are numerous disagreements\nwithin the modern aesthetic tradition (between Kant and Baumgarten,\njust to begin with). Instead, his thesis is that even the\ndisagreements in the modern aesthetic tradition take place within the\nframework of a common approach. It is this shared framework that\nHeidegger designates when he refers to the \u201caesthetic\u201d\napproach to art. As we would expect, this basic framework\nundergirds the paradigmatic inquiry of modern aesthetics, the study of\nbeauty through a \u201cconsideration of humanity\u2019s state of\nfeeling in relation to the beautiful.\u201d In all the aesthetic\ninvestigations which take their cues from this one, Heidegger\nobserves:\n\n\nThe artwork is posited as the \u201cobject\u201d for a\n\u201csubject,\u201d and this subject-object relation, specifically\nas a relation of feeling, is definitive for aesthetic\nconsideration. (N1 78/GA43 91)\n\n\nIn other words, modern aesthetics frames its understanding of art by\npresupposing the subject/object dichotomy: Aesthetics presupposes\na fundamental divide between the art \u201cobject\u201d and the\nexperiencing \u201csubject,\u201d a divide which is subsequently\ncrossed by the commerce of sensation or feeling. Of course, the\nsubject/object dichotomy forms the very basis of the modern worldview,\nso we would be surprised if modern aesthetics did not presuppose\nit. So, what specifically does Heidegger object to about the way\nthe aesthetic approach to art presupposes a viewing subject, standing\nbefore some art object, enjoying (or not enjoying) his or her sensory\nexperience of this artwork? What is supposed to be the problem\nwith this aesthetic picture of art?\n2.2 Heidegger\u2019s Critique of the Aesthetic Approach\n\n\nIn a provocatively-titled essay delivered in 1938, \u201cThe Age of\nthe World Picture,\u201d Heidegger provides a succinct formulation of\nwhat it means to approach art aesthetically that helps us reach the\ncore of his objection to aesthetics. When \u201cart gets pushed\ninto the horizon of aesthetics,\u201d he writes, this\n\n\nmeans [1] that the artwork becomes an object of lived experience\n[Gegenstand des Erlebens], and [2] in this way art comes to\ncount as an expression of human life [Lebens]. (QCT\n116/GA5 75)\n\n\nHeidegger is making two connected points here (which are numbered\naccordingly). The first is that when art is understood and\napproached \u201caesthetically,\u201d artworks become\nobjects for human subjects to experience in an especially\nintense, vital, or meaningful way. We can see this if we unpack\nhis typically dense language: As Heidegger frequently points out,\nin the modern, post-Cartesian world, an \u201cobject,\u201d\nGegenstand, is something that \u201cstands opposite\u201d a\nhuman subject, something external to subjectivity. In\norder to experience an object, the modern subject supposedly must first\nget outside the immanent sphere of its own subjectivity so as to\nencounter this \u201cexternal\u201d object, and then return back to\nits subjective sphere bearing the fruits of this encounter. Given\nthe modern subject/object dichotomy, such an adventure beyond\nsubjectivity and back again is required for the experience of any\nobject. But in the case of the art object, Heidegger is pointing\nout, the adventure beyond subjectivity and back again is a particularly\nintense, meaningful, or enlivening one: A \u201clived\nexperience\u201d is an experience that makes us feel \u201cmore\nalive,\u201d as Heidegger suggests by emphasizing the etymological\nconnection between Erleben and Lebens, \u201clived\nexperience\u201d and \u201clife.\u201d\n\n\nThe second point Heidegger is trying to make is that when artworks\nbecome objects for subjects to have particularly meaningful experiences\nof, these artworks themselves also get understood thereby as meaningful\nexpressions of an artistic subject\u2019s own life experiences.\nHeidegger does not ever develop any argument for this point; the\nthought simply seems to be that once aesthetics understands artworks as\nobjects of which we can have meaningful experiences, it is only logical\nto conceive of these art objects themselves in an isomorphic way, as\nmeaningful expressions of the lives of the artists who created\nthem. Still, this alleged isomorphism of aesthetic\n\u201cexpression and impression\u201d is not immediately\n obvious.[15]\nThink,\nfor example, about the seriously playful \u201cfound art\u201d\ntradition in Surrealism, dada, Fluxus, and their heirs, a tradition in\nwhich ordinary objects get seditiously appropriated as\n\u201cart.\u201d (The continuing influence of Marcel\nDuchamp\u2019s \u201creadymade\u201d remains visible in everything\nfrom Andy Warhol\u2019s meticulously reconstructed\n \u201cBrillo Boxes\u201d\n(1964) to Ruben Ochoa\u2019s\nlarge-scale installations of industrial detritus such as broken\nconcrete, rebar, and chain-link fencing, such as\n \u201cIdeal Disjuncture\u201d\n(2008). Vattimo thus suggests that\nDuchamp\u2019s \u201cFountain\u201d illustrates the way an artwork\ncan disclose a new world, a world in which high art comes to celebrate\nnot only the trivial and ordinary but also the vulgar and even\nthe\n obscene.)[16]\nThis tradition initially seems like a\nseries of deliberate counter-examples to the aesthetic assumption that\nartworks are meaningful expressions of an artist\u2019s own\nsubjectivity.\n\n\nEven in this tradition, however, the artists\u2019 appropriations\nare never truly random but invariably require some selection,\npresentation, and the like, and thus inevitably reopen interpretive\nquestions about the significance these art objects have for the\nartistic subject who chose them. (Why this particular object?\nWhy present it in just this way?) It is thus not surprising\nthat the founding work of found \u201canti-art,\u201d\nDuchamp\u2019s\n \u201cFountain\u201d\n(1917)\u2014his deliciously seditious\ninstallation of a deliberately inverted, humorously signed (by\n\u201cR. Mutt\u201d), and brilliantly re-titled urinal in an art\ngallery\u2014is typically treated in contemporary aesthetics as an\nextreme expression of Duchamp\u2019s own artistic subjectivity, not as\nits\n absence.[17]\nHere one could also point to the\nfailure of Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s attempt to deconstruct the found\nart ideal of unique and spontaneous invention in his incredible\n\u201ccombines,\u201d\n \u201cFactum I and Factum II,\u201d\nworks which, despite\nRauschenberg\u2019s painstaking efforts to make them identical, instead\nwork to suggest the stubborn uniqueness of any given artwork. So, even\nthe found art tradition of the readymade and its heirs reinforces\nHeidegger\u2019s point that, in the basic aesthetic approach to art,\nart objects are implicitly understood as meaningful expressions of\nartists\u2019 lives that are capable of eliciting particularly intense or\nmeaningful experiences in viewing subjects.\n\n\nIn this aesthetic approach, to put it simply, art objects\nexpress and intensify human subjects\u2019 experiences of\nlife. What Heidegger thus characterizes as the aesthetic\napproach to art will probably seem so obvious to most people that it\ncan be hard to see what he could possibly find objectionable about\nit. Art objects express and intensify human subjects\u2019\nexperiences of life; to many people, it might not even be clear what it\ncould mean to understand art in any other way. How should we\nunderstand and approach art, if not in terms of the meaningful\nexperiences that a subject might have of some art object, an art object\nwhich is itself a meaningful expression of the life of the artist (or\nartists) who created it? What exactly does Heidegger think is\nwrong with this \u201cpicture\u201d of art?\n\n\nDespite what one might expect from a phenomenologist like Heidegger,\nhis objection is not that the aesthetic view mischaracterizes the way\nwe late moderns ordinarily experience \u201cart.\u201d On the\ncontrary, Heidegger clearly thinks that what he characterizes as\n\u201cthe increasingly aesthetic fundamental position taken toward art\nas a whole\u201d (N1 88/GA43 103) does accurately describe the\nexperiences of art that take place\u2014when they do take\nplace\u2014in museums, art galleries, and installations; in\nperformance spaces, theaters, and movie houses; in cathedrals,\ncoliseums, and other ruins; in cityscapes as well as landscapes; in\nconcert halls, music clubs, and comic books; even when we listen to\nour speakers, headphones, ear-buds; and, sometimes (who could credibly deny\nit?), when we sit in front of our television screens, computer\nmonitors, iPhones, and so on. The experiences we have of what\nrises to the level of \u201cart\u201d in all such settings are indeed\n\u201caesthetic\u201d experiences, that is, particularly intense or\nmeaningful experiences that make us feel more alive; and, if we think\nabout it, we do tend to approach these art objects as expressions of\nthe life of the artists who created them. The aesthetic view\ncorrectly characterizes our typical experience of \u201cart\u201d in\nthe contemporary world\u2014and for Heidegger that is part of\nthe\n problem.[18]\n2.3 Symptoms of Subjectivism\n\n\nThis returns us to the bigger question we have been pursuing, and\nwhich we are now prepared to answer: Why exactly does Heidegger\nobject to our contemporary tendency to understand and approach art in\nthis aesthetic way? In the revealingly titled essay we have been\ndrawing on, \u201cThe Age of the World Picture,\u201d Heidegger\nexplains that \u201cthe process by which art gets pushed into the\nhorizon of aesthetics\u201d is neither conceptually neutral nor\nhistorically unimportant. On the contrary, the historical process\nby which Western humanity came to understand art as\n\u201caesthetics\u201d is so freighted with significance that it\nneeds to be recognized as \u201cone of the essential phenomena of the\ncontemporary age\u201d (QCT 116/GA5 75). Strikingly, Heidegger\ngoes so far as to assert that our tendency to treat art as aesthetics\nis just as significant for and revealing of our current historical\nself-understanding as are the increasing dominance of science and\ntechnology, the tendency to conceive of all meaningful human activity\nin terms of culture, and the growing absence of any god or gods in our\nWestern world (QCT 116\u20137/GA5 75\u20136). This is a surprising and\ndeliberately provocative claim, one apparently meant to provoke us into\nnoticing and thinking through something we ordinarily overlook.\nFor, how can our understanding of art as aesthetics be just as\nessential to our current historical self-understanding as are the\ndominance of science, the growing influence of technology, the\nubiquitous discussions of \u201cculture,\u201d and the withdrawal of\ngods from our history\u2014four seemingly much larger and more\nmomentous historical developments?\n\n\nThese five \u201cessential phenomena\u201d\u2014the historical\nascendance of science, technology, aesthetics, and culture, on the one\nhand, and, on the other, that historical decline of the divine which\nHeidegger (echoing Schiller) calls the \u201cungodding\u201d or\n\u201cdegodification\u201d (Entg\u00f6tterung) of the\nworld\u2014these all are \u201cequally essential\u201d\n(gleichwesentliche), Heidegger explains, because these five\ninterlocking phenomena express and so reveal the underlying direction\nin which the contemporary world is moving historically. Science,\ntechnology, aesthetics, culture, and degodification are \u201cequally\nessential\u201d as five major historical developments that feed into\nand disclose (what we could think of\nas) the current, that is, the underlying historical\ndirection or Zeitgeist of our contemporary\n world.[19] \n In the late 1930s, Heidegger\u2019s name for the underlying direction in which\nthe age is moving is \u201csubjectivism,\u201d a movement he defines\nas humanity\u2019s ongoing attempt to establish \u201cmastery over the\ntotality of what-is\u201d (QCT 132/GA5 92). Subjectivism, in\nother words, designates humanity\u2019s increasingly global quest to\nachieve complete control over every aspect of our objective reality,\nto establish ourselves as the being \u201cwho gives the measure and\nprovides the guidelines for everything that is\u201d (QCT 134/GA5\n94). Heidegger\u2019s fundamental objection to the aesthetic approach to\nart, then, is that such an approach follows from and feeds back\ninto subjectivism, contemporary humanity\u2019s ongoing effort to\nestablish \u201cour unlimited power for calculating, planning, and\nmolding [or \u2018breeding,\u2019 Z\u00fcchtung] all\nthings\u201d (QCT 135/GA5 94).\n2.4 How Aesthetics Reflects and Reinforces Subjectivism\n\n\nIn order to understand why Heidegger thinks the aesthetic approach\nto art reflects and reinforces subjectivism, we need to know why\nHeidegger characterizes humanity\u2019s ongoing attempt to master\nevery aspect of our objective reality as \u201csubjectivism\u201d in\nthe first\n place.[20]\nWe saw earlier that in the modern,\npost-Cartesian world, an \u201cobject\u201d (Gegen-stand),\nis something that \u201cstands opposite\u201d a human\nsubject, something which is \u201cexternal\u201d to the\nsubjective sphere. This subject/object dichotomy seems obvious\nwhen one is theorizing from within the modern tradition, in which it\nhas functioned as an axiom since Descartes famously argued that the\nsubject\u2019s access to its own thinking possesses an indubitable\nimmediacy not shared by our access to objects, which must thus be conceived of as\nexternal to subjectivity.\n\n\nYet, as Heidegger argues in Being and Time (1927), taking\nthis modern subject/object dichotomy as our point of departure leads us\nto fundamentally mischaracterize the way we experience the everyday\nworld in which we are usually unreflectively immersed, the world of our\npractical engagements. By failing to recognize and do justice to\nthe integral entwinement of self and world that is basic to our\nexperiential navigation of our lived environments, modern philosophy\neffectively splits the subject off from objects and from other\nsubjects. In this way, modern philosophy lays the conceptual\ngroundwork for subjectivism, the \u201cworldview\u201d in\nwhich an intrinsically-meaningless objective realm\n(\u201cnature\u201d) is separated epistemically from isolated,\nvalue-bestowing, self-certain subjects, and so needs to be mastered\nthrough the relentless epistemological, normative, and practical\nactivities of these subjects. Heidegger suggests that this\nproblem is not merely theoretical, because the subjectivism of the\nmodern worldview functions historically like a self-fulfilling\nprophecy. Its progressive historical realization generates not\nonly the political freedoms and scientific advances we cherish, but\nalso unwanted downstream consequences such as our escalating\nenvironmental crisis and less predictable side-effects like the\naestheticization of\n art.[21]\n2.5 Undermining the Subject/Object Dichotomy Phenomenologically\n\n\nSo, how does the aestheticization of art follow from\nsubjectivism? (This is easier to see than Heidegger\u2019s\nconverse claim\u2014that the aestheticization of art feeds back into\nand reinforces subjectivism\u2014so we will address it first.)\nBeing and Time does not undermine the subject/object dichotomy by\ntrying to advance the incredible thesis that the self really exists in\na continuous and unbroken unity with its world. Instead,\nHeidegger seeks to account for the fact that our fundamental, practical\nengagement with our worlds can easily break down in ways that generate\nthe perspective the subject/object dichotomy describes. Most of\nthe time, we encounter ourselves as immediately and unreflectively\nimmersed in the world of our concerns rather than as standing over\nagainst an \u201cexternal\u201d world of objects. Just think,\nfor example, of the way you ordinarily encounter a hammer when you are\nhammering with it, or a pen while you are writing with it, a bike while\nriding it, a car while driving it, or even, say, a freeway interchange\nas you drive over it for the umpteenth time. This all changes,\nhowever, when our practical engagement with the world of our concerns\nbreaks down. When the head flies off the hammer and will not go\nback on (and no other hammering implement is available to complete the\ntask at hand); when the pen we are writing with runs out of ink (and we\nhave no other); when our bike tire goes flat or our car breaks down in\nthe middle of a trip; when we find ourselves standing before an artwork\nthat we cannot make sense of; or, in general, when we are still\nlearning how to do something and encounter some unexpected difficulty\nwhich stops us in our tracks\u2014in all such cases what Heidegger\ncalls our ordinary, immediate \u201chands-on\u201d\n(zuhanden) way of coping with the world of our practical\nconcerns undergoes a \u201ctransformation\u201d (Umschlag)\nin which we come to experience ourselves as isolated subjects standing\nreflectively before a world of external objects, which we thereby come\nto experience as standing over against us in the mode of something\nobjectively \u201con hand\u201d (vorhanden) (BT 408\u20139/SZ 357\u20138).\n\n\nIn other words, Heidegger does not deny the reality of the\nsubject/object relation but, rather, points out that our experience of\nthis subject/object relation derives from and so\npresupposes a more fundamental level of experience, a\nprimordial modality of engaged existence in which self and world are\nunited rather than divided. Heidegger believes that modern\nphilosophy\u2019s failure to solve the problem of skepticism about the\nexternal world shows that those who begin with the subject/object\ndivide will never be able to bridge it subsequently (BT 249\u201350/SZ\n205\u20136). He thus insists that this more primordial level of\npractically engaged, \u201chands-on\u201d existence\u2014in which\nself and world are unified\u2014must be the starting point of any\ndescription of ordinary human experience that seeks to do justice to\nwhat such experience is really like, a phenomenological dictum\nHeidegger insists should also govern our attempts to describe our\nmeaningful encounters with works of art.\n2.6 Phenomenology Against Aesthetic Subjectivism\n\n\nFollowing the phenomenological dictum that we should describe our\nexperience of art in a way that is not distorted by the presuppositions\nwe have inherited from the metaphysical tradition is easier said than\ndone, however, for at least two reasons. First, the\nsubject/object dichotomy is so deeply entrenched in our\nself-understanding that it has come to implicitly structure the\nfundamental aesthetic approach (as we have seen). Second, it is\nnot immediately clear where (let alone how) we should look to discover\nart in a non-aesthetic way. Indeed, it now seems natural for us\nto think that what makes our experience of art objects significant is\nthat such experiences allow us human subjects temporarily to transcend\nthe sphere of our own subjectivity by getting in touch with art objects\noutside ourselves, because these transcendent experiences can\nprofoundly enrich our subjective experience.\n\n\nIn Heidegger\u2019s view, however, this aesthetic perspective gets\nthe story backward. We do not begin confined to our subjective\nspheres, temporarily leave those spheres behind in order to experience\nart objects, only to return back to subjectivity once again, enriched\nby the \u201cbooty\u201d we have captured during our adventure in the\nexternal world of art objects (BT 89/SZ 62). The reverse is\ntrue: Human existence originally \u201cstands\noutside\u201d (ek-sistere) itself, integrally involved with\nthe world in terms of which we ordinarily make sense of\n ourselves.[22]\nWe do\noccasionally experience ourselves as subjects confronting objects (for\nexample, when we try to learn to draw or paint realistically, or when\nwe find ourselves standing befuddled before an art object), but the\nexperience of ourselves as subjects confronting objects is\ncomparatively infrequent and takes place on the background of a more\nbasic experience of ourselves as integrally involved with the world of\nour practical concerns, an experience of fundamental self/world\nintertwinement to which we always return.\n\n\n\u201cProximally and for the most part [or \u2018initially and\nusually,\u2018 zun\u00e4chst und zumeist],\u201d as Heidegger\nlikes to say, we do not stand apart from the entities that populate our\nworld, observing them dispassionately\u2014or even passionately,\nhoping to transcend an isolated subjective sphere which in fact we are\nusually already beyond. Why, then, should we privilege the\ndetached, subject/object framework that results from the breakdown of\nour engaged experience when we try to approach art\nphilosophically? We should not; trying to approach art while\nstaying within the aesthetic approach is like trying to learn what it\nis like to ride a bike by staring at a broken bicycle: It is so\nto privilege the detached perspective of the observer that the\nparticipatory perspective gets eclipsed and forgotten. In\nHeidegger\u2019s view, the phenomenologically faulty presuppositions\nof modern philosophy have misled aesthetics into looking for the work\nof art in the wrong place, at a derived rather than the basic level of\nhuman interaction with the world, and thus into mistaking an intense\nsubjective experience of an external object for an encounter with the\ntrue work of art.\n\n\nModern aesthetics presupposes the subject/object dichotomy and then\nproblematically tries to describe the subsequent interaction between\ntwo allegedly heterogeneous domains, instead of recognizing and seeking\nto describe the prior role works of art play in the background of our\neveryday worldly engagement, in which no such dichotomy can yet be\nfound. Heidegger\u2019s post-aesthetic thinking about the work\nof art will thus instead seek to describe the usually unnoticed way in\nwhich artworks can form and inform our basic historical sense of what\nis and what matters (as we saw in section 1.1). Heidegger\u2019s\nthinking about the formative role art can play in the background of our\nself-understanding is \u201cpost-aesthetic\u201d in that it seeks to\nget past the constitutive mistakes of aesthetics, but it might also be\ncharacterized as \u201cpre-aesthetic\u201d insofar as the way he\ntries to go beyond aesthetics is by getting back behind aesthetics in\norder to do justice to that more primordial level of existence\naesthetics overlooks. Indeed, although this initially sounds\nparadoxical, Heidegger suggests that the best way to get beyond\naesthetic experience is to transcend it from within (that is, to\nexperience the way a subject\u2019s experience of an aesthetic object\ncan lead beyond or beneath itself), as we will see when we turn to his\nphenomenological analysis of Van Gogh\u2019s painting.\n\n\nTo sum up, then, because aesthetics tries to describe artworks from\nthe perspective of a subject confronting an external art object, the\naesthetic approach begins always-already \u201ctoo late\u201d (BT\n249/SZ 207). Aesthetics looks for art in the wrong place (at a\nderivative rather than primordial level of human interaction with the\nworld), and what it finds there is not the true work of art.\nMisled by the presuppositions of modern philosophy, aesthetics\noverlooks that more primordial level of human existence where,\nHeidegger will argue, true art inconspicuously accomplishes its\nontologically-revolutionary work.\n2.7 From Modern Subjectivism to Late-Modern Enframing in Aesthetics\n\n\nBefore turning our attention to Heidegger\u2019s post-aesthetic\nthinking, the last thing we need to do is to clarify his more difficult\nclaim that aesthetics not only follows from but also feeds back\ninto subjectivism. What makes this claim difficult to grasp\nis the specific twist Heidegger gives to it: Put simply,\naesthetics feeds back into subjectivism in a way that leads\nsubjectivism beyond itself\u2014and into something even worse than\nsubjectivism. In aesthetics, Heidegger suggests, subjectivism\n\u201csomersaults beyond itself [selbst\n\u00fcberschl\u00e4gt]\u201d into enframing (N1 77/GA43\n90). We can see how subjectivism somersaults beyond itself into\nenframing if we return to Heidegger\u2019s definition of subjectivism\nin \u201cThe Age of the World Picture,\u201d according to which\nmodern subjectivism names our modern attempt to secure\n\u201cour unlimited power for calculating, planning, and molding [or\n\u2018breeding,\u2019 Z\u00fcchtung] all things\u201d (QCT\n135/GA5 94). It is not difficult to detect a subtle resistance to\nthe National Socialist worldview and (what Heidegger understood as) its\nNietzschean roots in Heidegger\u2019s 1938 critique of Western\nhumanity\u2019s drive toward the total mastery of the world through\n\u201ccalculating, planning, and breeding.\u201d But more\nimportantly for our purposes, such descriptions of humanity\u2019s\ndrive to master the world completely through the coldly rational\napplication of calculative reasoning also show that what\nHeidegger calls \u201csubjectivism\u201d is a conceptual and\nhistorical precursor to what he will soon call \u201cenframing\u201d\n(or Gestell).\n\n\n\u201cEnframing\u201d is Heidegger\u2019s famous name for the\ntechnological understanding of being that underlies and shapes our\ncontemporary age. Just as Descartes inaugurates modern\nsubjectivism (as we have seen), so Nietzsche inaugurates\nlate-modern enframing by understanding being\u2014the\n\u201ctotality of entities as such\u201d\u2014as \u201ceternally\nrecurring will to power.\u201d Heidegger thinks that\nNietzsche\u2019s \u201contotheology\u201d (that means, to put it\nbriefly, Nietzsche\u2019s way of grasping the totality of what-is from\nboth the inside-out and the outside-in at the same time) worked to\ninaugurate our own late-modern view that reality is nothing but forces\ncoming-together and breaking-apart with no end other than the\nself-perpetuating growth of force itself. By tacitly approaching\nreality through the lenses of this Nietzschean ontotheology, we\nincreasingly come to understand and so to treat all entities as\nintrinsically-meaningless \u201cresources\u201d (Bestand)\nstanding by for efficient and flexible optimization. It is (to\ncut a long story short) this nihilistic technologization of\nreality that Heidegger\u2019s later thinking is dedicated to finding a\npath\n beyond.[23]\nFor Heidegger, true art opens just such\na path, one that can guide us beyond enframing\u2019s ontological\n\u201ccommandeering of everything into assured availability\u201d\n(PLT 84/GA5 72), as we will see in section 3.\n\n\nFirst, however, we need to understand how subjectivism leads beyond\nitself into enframing. Put simply, subjectivism becomes enframing\nwhen the subject objectifies itself\u2014that is, when the\nhuman subject, seeking to master and control all aspects of its\nobjective reality, turns that impulse to control the world of objects\nback onto itself. If we remember that modern\nsubjectivism designates the human subject\u2019s quest to\nachieve total control over all objective aspects of reality, then we\ncan see that late-modern enframing emerges historically out of\nsubjectivism as subjectivism increasingly transforms the human subject\nitself into just another object to be controlled.\nEnframing, we could say, is subjectivism squared (or\nsubjectivism applied back to the subject). For, the subjectivist\nimpulse to master reality redoubles itself in enframing, even though\nenframing\u2019s objectification of the subject dissolves the very\nsubject/object division that initially drove the subject\u2019s\nrelentless efforts to master the objective world standing over against\nit (Thomson 2005). Subjectivism \u201csomersaults beyond\nitself\u201d in our late-modern age of \u201cenframing\u201d because\nthe impulse to control everything intensifies and accelerates even as\nit breaks free of its modern moorings and circles back on the subject\nitself, turning the human subject into just one more object to be\nmastered and controlled\u2014until the modern subject becomes just\nanother late-modern entity to be efficiently optimized along with\neverything else. We are thus moving from modern subjectivism to\nthe late-modern enframing of reality insofar as we understand and\nrelate to all things, ourselves included, as nothing but\nintrinsically-meaningless \u201cresources\u201d standing by for\nendless optimization. Interestingly, Heidegger saw this\ntechnological understanding of being embodied in contemporary works of\nart like the \n modern butterfly interchange on a freeway,\nwhich, like a\nlate-modern temple, quietly reinforces our technological understanding\nof all reality as\n \u201ca network of long-distance traffic, spaced in a way calculated for maximum speed\u201d\n(PLT 152/GA7 155), an optimizing function now\nserved even more efficiently and pervasively by the internet (to which\nwe are now connected by millions of little shrines, made ever faster,\nmore efficient and portable, and which we find ourselves increasingly\nunable to live\n without).[24]\n\n\nIn the late 1930s, Heidegger understood such technological\noptimization as an all-encompassing attempt to derive the maximal\noutput from the minimal input, a quantification of quality that\nthreatens to dissolve quality in the same way that the objectification\nof the subject threatens to dissolve subjectivity. Heidegger\nseems first to have recognized this objectification of the subject in\nthe Nazis\u2019 coldly calculating eugenics programs for\n\u201cbreeding\u201d a master race, but (as he predicted) that\nunderlying impulse to objectively master the human subject continues\nunabated in more scientifically plausible and less overtly horrifying\nforms of contemporary genetic\n engineering.[25]\nMost importantly for us\nhere, Heidegger also recognized this ongoing objectification of the\nsubject in the seemingly innocuous way that aesthetics\n\u201csomersaults beyond itself\u201d into neuroscientific attempts\nto understand and control the material substrate of the mind.\nFor, once aesthetics reduces art to intense subjective experience, such\nexperiences can be studied objectively through the use of EEGs,\nfMRIs, MEG and PET scans (and the like), and in fact aesthetic\nexperiences are increasingly being studied in this way. At the\nUniversity of New Mexico\u2019s MIND Institute, to mention just one\ntelling example, subjects were given \u201cbeautiful\u201d images to\nlook at and the resulting neuronal activity in their brains was studied\nempirically using one of the world\u2019s most powerful functional\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging machines. In this way, as Heidegger\npredicted in 1937:\n\n\nAesthetics becomes a psychology that proceeds in the manner of the\nnatural sciences; that is, states of feeling become self-evident facts\nto be subjected to experiments, observation, and measurement. (N1\n89/GA43 106)\n\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Heidegger writes, \u201cthe final consequences\nof the aesthetic inquiry into art are thought through to the end\u201d\n(N1 91/GA43 108). Aesthetics reaches its logical\nconclusion\u2014the \u201cfulfillment or consummation\u201d\n(Vollendung) which completes it and so brings it to its\nend\u2014when it thus \u201csomersaults beyond itself\u201d into\nenframing.\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s objection to aesthetic enframing, then, is not just that\nthe work of art is increasingly falling under the influence of\nenframing\u2014that artworks too are becoming mere resources for the\nart industry, standing reserves piled in storerooms \u201clike\npotatoes in a cellar\u201d to be quickly and efficiently\n\u201cshipped like coal\u2026or logs\u2026from one exhibition to\nanother\u201d (PLT 19/GA5 3). He is even more troubled by the way\nart, reduced to aesthetics, does not just get enframed but\nparticipates in the enframing\u2014for example, when the feeling of\nbeauty is reduced to a purportedly objective brain state to be\nprecisely measured and controlled through cognitive\nneuroscience.[26]\n\n\nAs the human subject turns its subjectivist impulse to control the\nobjective world back onto itself in such neuroscientific\nexperimentation, aesthetics increasingly becomes just one more\napproach reinforcing the technological \u201cenframing\u201d of all\nreality. Heidegger thus reaches a harsh verdict: Aesthetic\n\u201cexperience is the element in which art dies. This dying goes on\nfor so long that it takes several centuries\u201d (PLT 79/GA5\n 67).[27]\nFortunately, Heidegger\u2019s prognosis is not as bleak as this\napparent death sentence suggests. That art is slowly dying as\naesthetics, he clarifies in a later addition,\n\n\ndoes not mean that art is utterly at an end. That will be the\ncase only if [aesthetic] experience remains the sole element for\nart. Everything depends on getting out of [aesthetic] experience\nand into being-here [Da-sein], which means reaching an\nentirely different \u201celement\u201d for the \u201cbecoming\u201d\nof art. (P 50 note b/GA5 67 note b)\n\n\nIn other words, art is dying only as aesthetics, and the death of art\nas aesthetics makes possible the transformative rebirth of art as\nsomething other than a subject\u2019s experience of an object.  Indeed,\njust as modern subjectivism led beyond itself historically into\nlate-modern enframing, so Heidegger believes enframing, in turn, can\nlead beyond itself into a genuine post-modernity, an age that\ntranscends our late-modern age\u2019s ongoing technologization of reality\nand its nihilistic erosion of all intrinsic meaning (the void which we\ntry to fill with all our superficial talk about \u201cvalues\u201d)\n(see Thomson 2011, 60\u20132). This hope for an historical turning\ntoward a genuinely meaningful post-modernity is what motivates\nHeidegger\u2019s phenomenological attempt to describe and so convey a\npost-aesthetic encounter with art, to which we now turn.\n2.8 Conclusion and Transition:  From Hegel\u2019s End of Art to Heidegger\u2019s Other Beginning\n\n\nBecause of the predicament in which modern aesthetics has left us,\nHeidegger provisionally accepts the truth of Hegel\u2019s famous\njudgment that:\n\n\nArt no longer counts for us as the highest manner in which truth\nobtains existence for itself. \u2026[I]n its highest\ndetermination, vocation, and purpose [Bestimmung], art is and\nremains for us\u2026a thing of the past. (PLT 80/GA5\n68)\n\n\nStill, Heidegger nurtures the hope that (pace Hegel) the\ndistinctive truth manifest in art could once again attain the kind of\nhistory-transforming importance that Hegel and Heidegger agree it had\nfor the ancient Greeks but has lost in the modern world.\n\n\nThis \u201chighest\u201d truth of art for which Heidegger still\nhopes, however, is not Hegel\u2019s \u201ccertainty of the\nabsolute\u201d (GA5 68 note a). That is, Heidegger does not hold\nout hope for some perfect correspondence between (1) the\nhistorically-unfolding \u201cconcept\u201d Hegel believed was\nimplicit in the development of humanity\u2019s intersubjective\nself-understanding and (2) an objective manifestation of that\nintersubjective self-understanding in art. Thus, in Hegel\u2019s\nmost famous example, the tragic conflict between Antigone and Creon in\nSophocles\u2019 Antigone perfectly embodied the fundamental\nbut as of yet unresolved ethical conflicts\u2014between conscience and\nlaw, the family and the state, and so on\u2014which had arisen\nimplicitly in the intersubjective self-understanding of fifth-century\nAthens. Hegel thinks it is no longer possible for an artwork to\nperfectly express the tensions implicit in the self-understanding of\nthe age and thereby call for an historical people to envision a future\nage in which those tensions would be resolved (because this role was\ntaken over by religion and then by philosophy as our historical\nself-understanding grew increasingly complex). Heidegger,\nhowever, continues to hope for even more, namely, an artwork that\nalready embodies the transition between this age and the next\nand which is thus capable of helping to inaugurate that future age,\nhere and now.\n\n\nIn tacit opposition to Hegel, Heidegger thus suggests that\nart\u2019s highest \u201c[t]ruth is [not \u2018the certainty of the\nabsolute\u2019 but] the unconcealedness of entities as entities.\nTruth is the truth of being\u201d (PLT 81/GA5 69).\nHeidegger\u2019s defining hope for art, in other words, is that works\nof art could manifest and thereby help usher in a new understanding of\nthe being of entities, a literally \u201cpost-modern\u201d\nunderstanding of what it means for an entity to be, a postmodern\nontology which would no longer understand entities either as modern\nobjects to be controlled or as late-modern resources to be\n optimized.[28]\nHeidegger\nexpresses this hope that separates him from Hegel in the form of a\nquestion: \u201cThe truth of Hegel\u2019s judgment has not yet\nbeen decided,\u201d he writes, because\n\n\nthe question remains: Is art still an essential and a\nnecessary way in which that truth happens which is decisive for our\nhistorical existence, or is art this no longer? (PLT 80/GA5\n68)\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s point is that Hegel will no longer be\nright\u2014the time of great art will no longer be at an end\u2014if\ncontemporary humanity still needs an encounter with art in order to learn how\nto understand the being of entities in a genuinely post-modern\n way, and if we still remain capable of such an\n encounter.[29]\n\n\nAs this suggests, the ultimate goal of Heidegger\u2019s thinking\nabout art is to show what it would mean to move from a modern aesthetic\nexperience of an art object to a genuinely post-modern encounter with a\nwork of art, so that we can thereby learn from art how to transcend\nmodernity from within. As Heidegger will later claim, when we\nencounter a true work of art,\n\n\nthe presencing [Anwesen] of that which appears to our\nlook\u2026is different than the standing of what stands-opposite [us]\nin the sense of an object. (PLT 82/GA5 71)\n\n\nBut what exactly is the difference between an aesthetic experience\nof an art object and an encounter with the true\n\u201cpresencing\u201d of a work of art? And how is the\ntraversing of that difference in our engagement with a particular work\nof art supposed to teach us to understand being in a post-modern\nway? Part III explains Heidegger\u2019s fairly complex answers to\nthese difficult but momentous questions.\n3. Heidegger for Art, Introduction:  The Three Pillars of Heidegger\u2019s Understanding of Art \n\n\n\u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d\u2014an essay Heidegger\ndelivered repeatedly between 1935 and 1936, rewriting and expanding it\ninto three lectures (which became the three main sections of the\npublished essay, to which Heidegger then added a brief\n\u201cAfterword\u201d near the end of the 1930s and a slightly longer\n\u201cAddendum\u201d in 1957)\u2014is far and away the most\nimportant source for understanding his attempt to articulate an\nalternative to the aesthetic understanding of art, although several\nother works (contemporaneous as well as later) also provide important\nclues to his\n view.[30]\nIn the final version of this famous\nessay, Heidegger meditates on three different works of art in\nsuccession: A painting of \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d by\nVincent van Gogh; a poem entitled \u201cThe Roman Fountain\u201d by\nC. F. Meyer, and an unspecified Greek temple at Paestum (most likely\nthe temple to Hera). Leading Heidegger scholars such as Hubert\nDreyfus and Julian Young rely almost entirely on Heidegger\u2019s\ninterpretation of the ancient Greek temple in order to explicate his\n\u201cpromethean\u201d view of art\u2019s historically revolutionary\npotential, its ability to focus and transform our sense of what is and\nwhat matters (as we saw in section 1.1). Young (2001, p. 22) and\nDreyfus (2005, p. 409) suggest that Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of\nVan Gogh is \u201canomalous\u201d and \u201clargely\nirrelevant\u201d to this view, despite the fame generated by the\nlongstanding controversy surrounding it (a controversy to which we will\nreturn at the\n end).[31]\nLike almost all other scholars,\nmoreover, Dreyfus and Young simply overlook Heidegger\u2019s\nintroduction of Meyer\u2019s poem\u2014even as they recognize that\nfor Heidegger, like Plato, \u201cpoetry\u201d names the very essence\nof art (namely, poi\u00easis or \u201cbringing into\nbeing\u201d), hence Heidegger\u2019s claim that: \u201cAll\nart [that is, all bringing-into-being] \u2026 is essentially\npoetry\u201d (PLT 73/GA5 59). We thus have to wonder:\nIs the only complete poem Heidegger included in the essay that advances\nthis view of poetry as the essence of art really of no\n significance?[32]\n\n\nIn my view, Heidegger\u2019s analysis of each of these three works\ncontributes something important to his overarching attempt to guide\nreaders into a phenomenological encounter with art that is capable of\nhelping us transcend modern aesthetics from within. To put it\nsimply, the temple motivates and helps develop the details of\nHeidegger\u2019s larger project; the poem implicitly contextualizes\nand explains it; and the painting (and only the painting) directly\nexemplifies it. In order to see how, let us take these points in\norder. Heidegger\u2019s imaginative reconstruction of the lost\ntemple helps motivate his quest for a non-aesthetic encounter with art,\nbut not (as is often said) because he seeks some nostalgic return to\nthe Greek world. Heidegger dismisses such a revival as an\nimpossibility because the ancient temple\u2014just like the medieval\ncathedral\u2014no longer gathers its historical world around it and\nthus no longer works as great art, and such \u201cworld-withdrawal and\nworld-decay can never be reversed\u201d (PLT 41/GA5 26).\nInstead, the Greek temple shows that art was once encountered in a way\nother than as a subject\u2019s intense aesthetic experience of an\nobject, and thus suggests that, while those ancient and medieval worlds\nhave been lost irretrievably, other works of art might yet be\nencountered non-aesthetically in our late-modern world. Heidegger\nthus elaborates his philosophical vision of how the temple worked for a\ntime to unify a coherent and meaningful historical world around itself\n(by inconspicuously focusing and illuminating its people\u2019s sense\nof what is and what matters) in order to suggest that a non-aesthetic\nencounter with art might yet do the same thing once again: A work\nof art might yet help to gather a new historical world around itself by\nfocusing and illuminating an understanding of being that does not\nreduce entities either to modern objects to be controlled or to\nlate-modern resources to be optimized.\n\n\nWhile Heidegger\u2019s project is thus undeniably inspired by the\npast, this inspiration serves his goal of helping us move historically\ninto the future. His guiding hope, we have seen, is that a\nnon-aesthetic encounter with a contemporary artwork will help us learn\nto understand the being of entities not as modern objects\n(\u201csubjectivism\u201d) or as late-modern resources\n(\u201cenframing\u201d) but in a genuinely post-modern way, thereby\nmaking another historical beginning. So, which work of art does\nHeidegger think can help us late moderns learn to transcend modern\naesthetics from within and thereby discover a path leading beyond\nmodernity? There are only two viable candidates to fill this\ncrucial role in \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d:\nMeyer\u2019s poem and Van Gogh\u2019s\n painting.[33]\n\n\nSo, why does Heidegger give such pride of place to Meyer\u2019s\npoem? The answer to this puzzle (which too few readers even\nnotice) is that the poem introduces the broader philosophical context\nof Heidegger\u2019s project by conveying his emerging understanding of\nhistoricity, the doctrine according to which our fundamental\nsense of reality changes over\n time.[34]\nThe ontological \u201ctruth\u201d\nthat Meyer\u2019s poem embodies\u2014and \u201csets to work,\u201d\nin Heidegger\u2019s creative appropriation of the poem\u2014is that\ntruth itself is essentially historical and, moreover, that this\nessential history of truth forms three successive \u201cepochs,\u201d\nin the same way that the \u201cjet\u201d of water fills the three\nconsecutive \u201cbasins\u201d in Meyer\u2019s eponymous\n fountain.[35]\nFor\nHeidegger, to put it more precisely, the relations Meyer\u2019s poem\ndescribes between the fountain\u2019s original \u201cjet\u201d and\nits three successive water basins illuminate the relations between\n\u201cbeing\u201d itself (that is, as we will see, the inexhaustible\nontological source of historical intelligibility) and the three main\nhistorical \u201cepochs\u201d or ages in Western humanity\u2019s\nunderstanding of being (as Heidegger conceived of this \u201chistory\nof being\u201d in 1936), namely, ancient \u201cGreece,\u201d\n\u201cthe middle ages,\u201d and \u201cthe modern age\u201d (PLT\n76\u20137/GA5\n 64\u20135).[36]\n\n\nThus, for example, just as the original \u201cjet\u201d of water\n\u201cfalls\u201d into the fountain\u2019s successive basins, so the\n\u201coverflowing\u201d ontological riches concealed in the ancient\nworld were first diminished in the medieval world. \u201cThe\nOrigin of the Work of Art\u201d make the contentious case that this\nontological diminution \u201cbegins\u201d when concepts central to\nthe ancient Greek understanding of being get translated into Latin\nwithout a full experience of what those concepts originally revealed\n(PLT 23/GA5 8). Hence the obvious appeal for Heidegger of\nMeyer\u2019s suggestive line: \u201cVeiling itself, this [first\nbasin] overflows / Into a second basin\u2019s ground\u201d (PLT\n37/GA5 23). What remained of these ontological\n\u201criches\u201d in the medieval world was then transposed into and\nreduced further in the modern epoch which, like the fountain\u2019s\nthird basin, stands at the furthest remove from its original source.\nIt thus seems clear that Heidegger included Meyer\u2019s poem\nbecause he believed it suggestively illuminated the way the history of\nbeing unfolds as an epochal history of decline, a \u201cfall\u201d which\nresults from this history\u2019s increasing forgetting of the source\nfrom which it ultimately springs\u2014the Ur-sprung or\n\u201corigin\u201d of Heidegger\u2019s essay\u2019s title\u2014in\na word: \u201cBeing\u201d (Sein), Heidegger\u2019s\nfamous name for the source from which all historical intelligibility\noriginates (by way of the disclosive \u201cnaming-into-being\u201d which\nHeidegger understands as the \u201cpoetic\u201d essence of art, as we\nwill see in the next section). In other words, Heidegger uses\nMeyer\u2019s poem to allude to the broader philosophical context that\nhelps explain and motivate the new historical beginning he hopes art\nwill help us inaugurate. Heidegger\u2019s use of this particular\npoem suggests, moreover, that in order to accomplish this \u201cother\nbeginning,\u201d Western humanity needs to learn to tap back into that\noriginal, ontological source (the overflowing \u201cjet\u201d of\nbeing), and that such a reconnection with the source of historical\nintelligibility is something art can still teach us. (Although\ninterpreters also overlook this, the quiet presence of a homophonous\n\u201cthird reich\u201d in Meyer\u2019s poem reminds us of the\ndeeply-troubling dimension of Heidegger\u2019s thinking in the\nmid-1930s, the fact that his philosophical hopes for the future were\nfor a brief time deeply entwined with his idiosyncratic understanding\nof the direction that the burgeoning National Socialist\n\u201crevolution\u201d might yet\n take.)[37]\n\n\nWhile both the temple and the poem thus remain quite important, only\nVan Gogh\u2019s painting directly exemplifies what Heidegger thinks it\nmeans to encounter art in a way that allows us to transcend modern\naesthetics from within. This means that Heidegger\u2019s\ninterpretation of Van Gogh\u2019s painting, far from being irrelevant,\nis actually the most important part of his essay. For, it is only\nfrom Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological interpretation of Van\nGogh\u2019s artwork that we late moderns can learn how to transcend\nmodern aesthetics from within, and thereby learn from art what it means\nto encounter being in a post-modern way. Since we have already\nsummarized Heidegger\u2019s \u201cpromethean\u201d view of the\nhistorically-revolutionary work accomplished by the ancient Greek\ntemple (in section 1.1), we will expand on the point of his return to\nGreece only briefly (in section 3.1), saying more about how this return\nto the past is supposed to help lead us into the future. The rest\nof what follows will be dedicated primarily to explaining\nHeidegger\u2019s pivotal understanding of Van Gogh\u2019s\n painting.[38]\nOur\nultimate objective will be to show how Heidegger\u2019s interpretation\nof Van Gogh allows him to move phenomenologically from the analysis of\na particular, individual (\u201contic\u201d) work of art to the\nontological structure of artwork in general. Along the way, we will\npresent the main details of the postmodern understanding of being that\nHeidegger thinks we can learn from a non-aesthetic encounter with the\nwork of art (section 3.7). Once we understand the ordered\nsequence of steps in the phenomenological interpretation whereby\nHeidegger thinks we can transcend modern aesthetics from within,\nmoreover, we will finally be able to resolve the long-standing\ncontroversy surrounding Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of Van Gogh\n(as we will see in section 4).\n3.1 Back to the Future:  Heidegger on the Essence of Art\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s introduction of \u201ca well-known painting by\nVan Gogh, who painted such shoes several times\u201d (PLT 33/GA5 18),\nis notoriously abrupt and puzzling to many readers. The path that\nleads Heidegger to Van Gogh\u2019s painting should not be too\nsurprising, however, because it is the same path we have been following\nhere. Looking back at \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d\ntwo years later (in 1938), Heidegger will write that:\n\n\nThe question of the origin of the work of art does not aim to set\nout a timelessly valid determination of the essence of artwork which\ncould also serve as the guiding thread for an historically\nretrospective clarification of the history of art. The question\nis most intimately connected with the task of overcoming aesthetics,\nwhich also means overcoming a certain conception of entities as what\nare objectively representable. (CP 354/GA65\n 503)[39]\n\n\nWe have seen that because aesthetics tries to describe artworks as\nobjects that express and intensify human subjects\u2019 experiences of\nlife, the aesthetic approach begins \u201calways already\u201d too\nlate. Modern aesthetics presupposes the perspective of a subject\nconfronting an external object and thereby misses the way art works\ninconspicuously in the background of human existence to shape and\ntransform our sense of what is and what matters.\n\n\nHeidegger expands this critique to include\n\u201crepresentation\u201d here because representations are what\nmodern philosophy typically uses to try to bridge the divide Descartes\nopened between subjects and objects. (The objective world\nallegedly \u201cexternal\u201d to subjectivity gets duplicated in\nminiature, as it were, and \u201cre-presented\u201d to the\nmind\u2014as in the famous Cartesian picture of consciousness as an\ninternal \u201ctheater of representations.\u201d) Of course,\nHeidegger does not deny that representations sometimes mediate our\nexperience of the world. What he denies is that representations\ngo \u201call the way down,\u201d that they plumb the depths of\nexistence. Instead, representations presuppose a level of\nexistence they cannot explain. Heidegger\u2019s fundamental\nphenomenological critique of the modern theoretical picture is that it\noverlooks and then cannot recapture the more basic level of engaged\nexistence, a practical coping with equipment in which no subject/object\ndichotomy has yet opened up because self and world remain integrally\nentwined and mutually\n determining.[40]\nThis primordial level of engaged\nexistence, we will see, is what Heidegger thinks Van Gogh\u2019s\npainting allows us to encounter and understand in a way that no mere\naesthetic representation ever could. In so doing, Heidegger\nthinks, Van Gogh\u2019s painting allows us to encounter the very\nessence of art.\n\n\nOn the basis of passages like the one above, however, some\ninterpreters claim that \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d\ndoes not seek to \u201cuncover the essence of art,\u201d but that\nis\n misleading.[41]\nAs Heidegger says, his essay does not\nseek to set out one \u201ctimelessly valid determination\u201d of the\nessence of art which would apply retrospectively to the entire history\nof art, but that is only because he does not understand essences the\nway they have been understood from Plato to Kripke, namely, as\n\u201ctimelessly valid determinations\u201d of what something\n is.[42]\nIn fact,\n\u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d does attempt to uncover and\ncommunicate art\u2019s historical \u201cessence,\u201d by which\nHeidegger means that structure which allows art to reveal itself in\ndifferent ways as it unfolds in the human understanding across\ntime. What is confusing for many readers is that this historical\nessence of art is not some substance underlying the different forms of\nart or even a fixed property that would enable us to distinguish art\nfrom non-art but, instead, an insubstantial and ever-changing\n\u201cessential strife\u201d that is built into the structure of all\nintelligibility (the structure whereby entities become intelligible as\nentities), as we will\n see.[43]\n\n\nRather than forcing Heidegger to develop an entire art history, the\nnormative demands of his critical project only require him to focus on\ntwo crucial historical moments in Western humanity\u2019s changing\nhistorical understanding of art\u2014a kind of before and after, as it\nwere, which contrasts the fullness of what has been possible with the\nnarrowness of what is currently actual. Heidegger is thus\nprimarily concerned to show, first, how the ancient Greeks encountered\nart in a non-aesthetic way (and so enshrined it in their temples), and\nsecond, how art is typically understood and experienced by us late\nmoderns, who remain caught in the grip of modern aesthetics and so\nunder the influence of \u201cmodern subjectivism\u201d (PLT 76/GA5\n63). As subjectivism\u2019s unlimited ambition to establish\n\u201cmastery over the totality of what-is\u201d (QCT 132/GA5 92)\nworks to objectify even modernity\u2019s vaunted subject, moreover, it\nincreasingly transforms modern subjectivism into late-modern\n\u201cenframing\u201d (as we saw in 2.7).\n\n\nIn \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art,\u201d Heidegger suggests\nthat modern subjectivism and late-modern enframing can be understood as\nsymptoms of Western humanity\u2019s continuing inability to accept our\ndefining existential finitude. The limitless ambition of our\nsubjectivist quest to master all reality conceptually results from our\nrefusal to own up to, make peace with, and find non-nihilistic ways to\naffirm the tragic truth Heidegger gleans from the ancients:\n\n\nMuch of what is cannot be brought under the rule of humanity.\nOnly a little becomes known. What is known remains approximate;\nwhat is mastered remains unstable. What-is is never something\n[entirely] man-made or even only a representation, as it can all too\neasily appear. (PLT 53/GA5 39)\n\n\nHeidegger takes off here from the second choral ode in Sophocles\u2019\nAntigone (which he discussed at length in 1935\u2019s\nIntroduction to Metaphysics). For Sophocles\u2019\nTheban elders, the one thing humanity cannot master is death. For\nHeidegger, thinking about death opens us up to the terrifyingly\n\u201cawesome\u201d insight that the known rests on the unknown, the\nmastered on the unmastered, like a small ship floating on a deep and\nstormy \u201csea\u201d (IM 159, 164/GA40 159,\n 162).[44]\nWe like to believe that\nhumanity is well on its way to mastering the universe, but art teaches\nus that we are far from having exhausted the possibilities inherent in\nintelligibility.\n\n\nYet, rather than leading us into despair over our essential human\nfinitude (the fact that we will never master the totality of what-is),\nart helps us learn to embrace this finitude by reminding us of its\nother side, namely, the fact that intelligibility will never exhaust\nits source. For, it remains possible for being to continue to\nbecome newly intelligible only if it cannot ever become fully\nintelligible. Art thus teaches us to embrace the insight that\nmeanings will never be exhausted as precisely what makes it possible\nfor us to continue to discover new meanings, and in this way art helps\nus see that human finitude is not something we should despair over or\nseek to deny though compensatory subjectivistic fantasies (of complete control or finally complete systems). Of\ncourse, the claim that we should give up thinking we could ever know\neverything does not entail that we should give up trying to know new\nthings\u2014quite the contrary. If the heroic is what helps us\naffirm and thereby transform the tragic (as the famous speech by\nSarp\u00eadon in Homer\u2019s Iliad suggests), then\nHeidegger\u2019s thinking about art is heroic: Art teaches us to\nembrace the initially tragic insight that being will never be\ncompletely revealed in time as the very thing that makes it possible\nfor human beings to continue to understand what-is in new and\npotentially more meaningful ways.\n\n\nIn sum, the point of Heidegger\u2019s juxtaposition of modern\nspleen and ancient ideal is not to call for the impossible revival of\nthe lost Greek past but, rather, to help motivate a new, post-aesthetic\nunderstanding of what art could still mean for us, now and in the\nfuture. If, instead of trying to obtain a kind of cognitive\nmastery over art through aesthetics\u2014or using aesthetics to extend\nour late-modern understanding of all that is as\nintrinsically-meaningless resources standing by to be\noptimized\u2014we simply allow ourselves to experience what is\nhappening within a great work of art, then Heidegger thinks we will be\nable to encounter the \u201cessential strife\u201d in which the true\nwork of art paradoxically \u201crests\u201d and finds its\n\u201crepose.\u201d When we encounter the\n\u201cmovement\u201d that paradoxically rests in the masterful\n\u201ccomposure\u201d of a great artwork, moreover, what we discover\ntherein is an \u201cinstability\u201d that underlies the entire\nintelligible order, an ontological tension (between revealing and\nconcealing, emerging and withdrawing) which can never be permanently\nstabilized and thus remains even in what is\n \u201cmastered.\u201d[45]\nIndeed,\nwhat is truly mastered artistically, Heidegger suggests, is what\nsomehow captures, preserves, and communicates this tension in the\nstructure of intelligibility, allowing us to encounter and understand\nthis essential tension in a way that helps us learn to transcend the\nlimits of our modern and late-modern ways of understanding what beings\nare.\n3.2 The Phenomenological Approach to Art\n\n\nTo encounter the paradoxical movement at rest within a great artwork\n(the mysterious movement that, Hammermeister nicely suggests, enables\nart to move us in turn), Heidegger believes we need only follow the\nphenomenological dictum that we should \u201csimply describe\u201d\nour experience of the work of art \u201cwithout any philosophical\ntheory\u201d (PLT 32/GA5\n 18).[46]\nThe phenomenological approach to art\nobliges us to\n\n\nrestrain from all usual doing and prizing, knowing and looking, in\norder to linger within the truth that is happening in the work.\nOnly the restraint of this lingering allows what is created to first be\nthe work that it is. (PLT 66/GA5\n 54)[47]\n\n\nYet, simply \u201cto let a being be the way it is [wie es\nist]\u201d turns out to be \u201cthe most difficult of\ntasks\u201d (PLT 31/GA5 16). For, insofar as the concepts we use\nto make sense of our experience remain uninterrogated as to their own\nbuilt-in interpretive biases, we tend not even to notice when\ninappropriate conceptual categories lead us to a distorted or\ninadequate apprehension of the phenomenon at issue.\n\n\nPhenomenology\u2019s ideal of pure description thus requires us to\nstruggle vigilantly against our usual tendency to force the square peg\nof recalcitrant experience into the round hole of ready-made conceptual\ncategories. (For example, since metaphysics tells us that things\nat rest cannot move, we are inclined to dismiss any inkling of movement\nin an artwork as some sort of idiosyncratic, subjective projection on\nour parts.) In order truly to be open to the way things show\nthemselves to us, then, we have \u201cto keep at a distance all\npreconceptions and interfering misconceptions\u201d [Vor- und\n\u00dcbergriffe] of what things are. Rather\nthan giving us license simply to do what comes \u201cnaturally,\u201d\nfollowing Husserl\u2019s famed phenomenological\ndictum\u2014\u201cBack to the things\nthemselves!\u201d\u2014requires us to struggle to discern and\nneutralize the usually unnoticed metaphysical presuppositions (such as\nthe modern assumption of a fundamental subject/object dichotomy) which,\nalthough they remain \u201cderivative\u201d of more basic experiences\nthat they cannot explain, nevertheless continue to pass themselves off\nas \u201cself-evident\u201d and so lead modern aesthetics off track\n(PLT 31/GA5 16).\n\n\nIt is not a coincidence that Van Gogh\u2019s painting is the first\nexample of an actual work of art that Heidegger mentions in \u201cThe\nOrigin of the Work of Art,\u201d and the context is revealing.\nHeidegger is introducing the concept of a \u201cthing,\u201d a\nseemingly obvious idea the complex history of which he then goes on to\nexplicate and deconstruct in detail (PLT 20\u201330/GA5 5\u201316), thereby\nundermining its initial appearance of\n obviousness.[48]\nBy showing that none of the three\nstandard metaphysical conceptions of a thing (which conceive of a thing\nvariously as \u201cthe bearer of traits, as the unity of a sensory\nmanifold, and as formed matter\u201d [PLT 30/GA5 15]) manages to\ncapture fully our sense of what things are, Heidegger is able to make\nthe crucial suggestion that there is something about a thing which\neludes all our attempts to capture and express it conceptually:\n\n\nThe inconspicuous thing withdraws itself from thought most\nstubbornly. Or can it be that this self-refusal of the mere\nthing, this self-contained refusal to be pushed around, belongs\nprecisely to the essential nature of things? (PLT 31\u20132/GA5\n17)\n\n\nBy suggesting that an ineliminable elusiveness\u2014an independence\nfrom human designs\u2014is in fact essential to what things are,\nHeidegger is motivating his own concept of the \u201cearth\u201d as\nwhat both informs and resists conceptualization. (Indeed, this\ncrucial insight that there is something essential to things that\nresists human control seems to be what motivates Heidegger to make the\ntransition from talking about the \u201cnothing\u201d to discussing\nthe \u201cearth,\u201d as we will see.) At the same time,\nHeidegger is also illustrating the phenomenological dictum that our\ncommon-sense view of things\u2014although it appears\n\u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cself-evident\u201d\u2014is often\nfreighted with unnoticed metaphysical presuppositions that can eclipse\nand so prevent a full encounter with the phenomena we face. By\nrevealing the limitations of Western philosophy\u2019s metaphysical\nconceptions of what \u201cthings\u201d are, Heidegger gives a\nconcrete demonstration of his critical-phenomenological (and obviously\nNietzsche-influenced) view that: \u201cWhat seems natural to us\nis presumably just the familiarity of a long-established custom which\nhas forgotten the unfamiliarity from which it arose\u201d (PLT 24/GA5\n9).\n\n\nThe fact that Heidegger\u2019s first mention of Van Gogh is framed\nby these two ways of undermining our usual sense of the obviousness of\nthings should lead us to suspect that he is introducing an ordinary\nidea that he will subsequently use phenomenology to try to excavate\nbeneath and so go beyond. Once we recognize the context, it is not difficult to detect\nthe irony in Heidegger\u2019s initial suggestion that \u201cartworks\nare familiar to everyone\u201d already since they populate our world\njust like all the other objects \u201con hand\u201d:\n\n\nOne [Man] finds works of architecture and sculpture erected\nin public places, in churches, and in private dwellings.\n\u2026Works are of course on hand [vorhanden, i.e.,\nobjectively present] like any other thing. The picture hangs on\nthe wall like a rifle or a hat. A painting, for example the one\nby Van Gogh that represents a pair of farmer\u2019s shoes, travels\nfrom one exhibit to another. Works are shipped like coal from the\nRuhr and logs from the Black Forest. (PLT 19/GA5 3)\n\n\nIn fact, it is clear that for Heidegger the very obviousness of the\npublic knowledge that artworks are objects and that they\nrepresent things conceals the more \u201coriginal\u201d\ntruths about art which he seeks to uncover in \u201cThe Origin of the\nWork of\n Art.\u201d[49]\n\n\nThat the initial familiarity of the anonymous \u201ceveryone\u201d\n(jedermann) with art objects and representational paintings\nturns out to be a superficial acquaintance that covers over the true\ndepths of the matter at issue should not be surprising.  Almost a\ndecade earlier, when Being and Time famously sought to\ndisclose the ubiquitous and thus usually unnoticed ways in which the\nanonymous \u201cone [das Man] unfolds its true\ndictatorship,\u201d Heidegger had already observed that \u201cwe\nread, see, and judge literature and art the way one sees and\njudges.\u201d So, for example, \u201ceveryone knows\u201d that Da\nVinci\u2019s\n \u201cMona Lisa\u201d\nis a great work of art; we think we\n\u201cknow\u201d this even if the painting has never spoken to us at\nall, or if we have only heard that \u201cthey say\u201d the enigmatic\nhint of a smile on her face is supposed to suggest the numinous\npresence of God, or the wry smirk of a secret lover, or, more recently,\nthat the sublime elusiveness of her smile finally can be\n\u201cexplained\u201d by neuroscientific findings about the way our\nbrains process different spatial\n frequencies.[50]\nThrough this kind of\n\u201cleveling down\u201d to a publicly-accessible, take-home\nmessage,\n\n\neverything primordial gets glossed over as something long\nfamiliar. Everything gained by a struggle becomes just something\nto be manipulated. Every mystery loses its power. (BT\n164\u20135/SZ 126\u20137)\n\n\n\u201cThe Origin [Ursprung] of the Work of Art\u201d\nsuggests, conversely, that by struggling personally with the mysteries\nat work in Van Gogh\u2019s painting of a \u201cA Pair of\nShoes,\u201d we can gain an insight into art\u2019s most\n\u201cprimordial\u201d (or \u201coriginal,\u201d\nUrspr\u00fcngliche) level of truth.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it is quite difficult to present the deepest truths\nthat emerge from the kind of personal struggle that existential\nphenomenology demands without thereby inadvertently supplying the\npublic with another leveled-down formula to bandy about, a familiar\ncatchphrase (like \u201clanguage is the house of being\u201d) that\nquickly becomes a superficial substitute for the insight it\nbespeaks. The problem, expressed metaphorically, is that\nreceiving a souvenir from someone else\u2019s journey makes a poor\nsubstitute for taking that voyage for oneself. Heidegger\u2019s\nrecognition of this difficulty helps explain why he seeks to\nshow at least as much as to say what he takes to be\nart\u2019s deepest truths in \u201cThe Origin of the Work of\nArt.\u201d Indeed, the distinguishing mark of the later\nHeidegger\u2019s \u201cpoetic\u201d style comes from the fact that,\nafter Being and Time, he is no longer content simply to\nconstruct arguments in relatively straightforward philosophical prose,\nbut also begins to try to lead his audience performatively to see the\nphenomenon ultimately at issue for themselves. This is a large\npart of what makes Heidegger\u2019s later works even more elusive and\nchallenging for contemporary philosophical readers than Being and\n Time.[51]\nNonetheless, by drawing on\nHeidegger\u2019s early as well as his later works, we can clearly\nunderstand the enduring philosophical challenge that his\nphenomenological approach to art seeks to surmount.\n3.3 The Phenomenological Difficulty Heidegger Introduces Van Gogh to Address\n\n\nThe basic problem, we have seen, is that the way works of art\nfunction in the background of our everyday experience cannot be\nadequately described in aesthetic terms (as a subject\u2019s\nexperience of an art object) because: (1) aesthetics presupposes\nthe subject/object dichotomy; (2) this subject/object dichotomy emerges\nonly at a secondary level of experience, when our primary, integral\nengagement with the world of practical equipment breaks down; and (3)\nsecondary structures of experience like the subject/object dichotomy\ncannot recapture the primordial level of our engagement with the world\n(the level from which it originally derives), because any such\ndescription of an external object \u201con hand\u201d for a subject misses\nprecisely what it is like to encounter \u201cequipment\u201d\nin a hands-on way. Objective descriptions of equipment bypass the\nvery \u201cequipmentality of equipment [Zeughaften des\nZeuges]\u201d (PLT 32/GA5 17)\u2014as Heidegger still phrases\nthe point in \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d\u2014because\nsuch descriptions fail to notice, let alone capture, what it is like to\nbe integrally involved with equipment in engaged use. The\nfundamental problem, then, is: How can such engaged use ever be\nadequately described and communicated?\n\n\nIt is this difficult attempt to describe phenomenologically\n\u201cwhat equipment in truth is\u201d (PLT 32/GA5 17)\u2014that is,\nto convey the way we encounter something when we are not aware of it as\nan object at all but, instead, are completely immersed in our practical\nengagement with it\u2014that motivates Heidegger not just to mention\nbut genuinely to introduce Van Gogh\u2019s painting, which Heidegger\nthus presents simply \u201cas an example of a common sort of\nequipment\u2014a pair of farmer\u2019s shoes\u201d (PLT 32/GA5\n18). In Van Gogh\u2019s most famous painting of\n \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d\n(1886), Heidegger believes we can\n\u201cdiscover what the equipmental being of equipment is in\ntruth\u201d (PLT 33/GA5 18). In other words, Heidegger thinks\nVan Gogh\u2019s painting reveals what it is like genuinely to\nencounter a shoe in its use as a shoe. As he puts it:\n\n\nThe farming woman wears her shoes in the field. Only here are\nthey what they are. They are all the more genuinely so, the less\nthe farming woman at work thinks about the shoes, or senses them at\nall, or is even aware of them. (PLT 33/GA5 18)\n\n\nHeidegger thus introduces Van Gogh\u2019s painting of (what he\ntakes to be) a farmer\u2019s shoes in order \u201cto facilitate the\nvisual realization\u201d of \u201cequipmentality,\u201d that\nprimordial modality of existence in which we are integrally involved\nwith our world and so encountering equipment in a non-thematic,\nhands-on\n way.[52]\n\n\nYet, this is a deeply paradoxical move, as Heidegger himself\nrealizes, because Van Gogh\u2019s painting does not picture shoes\nbeing used as equipment; it pictures shoes merely standing there like\nobjects in a still-life painting! We will thus remain caught in\nan aesthetic experience, Heidegger acknowledges, \u201cas long as we\nsimply look at the empty, unused shoes as they stand there in the\npicture\u201d (PLT 33/GA5 19). The deep puzzle here, then,\nis: How is Van Gogh\u2019s picture of \u201cempty, unused\nshoes\u201d standing there like objects supposed to help us uproot and\ntranscend the subject/object dichotomy lying at the heart of modern\naesthetics? How, to put the puzzle in Heidegger\u2019s terms, is\na picture supposed to help us find a way out of the age of the world\npicture? How is our experience of a painting of a pair of shoes\nstanding there like objects supposed to lead us back to a pre-objective\nencounter with \u201cequipmentality\u201d? How, in other words,\ncan aesthetics transcend itself from within?\n\n\nHere Heidegger has set up a genuine aporia\u2014or better, an\nHolzweg, a \u201cforest path\u201d or, more colloquially,\n\u201ca path to nowhere.\u201d It is not a coincidence that\nHolzwege is the title Heidegger gave to the book of essays\nthat opens with \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art.\u201d As\nHeidegger hints (in the otherwise empty page he had inserted into the\nbook, before its first page), an Holzweg is a path through the\nwoods made by foresters (and known to backwoods hikers as well as\nlocals who follow these paths to gather their own firewood, as\nHeidegger himself did). Such a path eventually comes to an\napparent dead-end, but this dead-end\u2014seen differently\u2014turns\nout to be a \u201cclearing\u201d (or Lichtung), that is, a\nplace from which the trees have been removed which thus offers an\nunexpected vista, an epiphany that, although it results only from\nwalking a particular path for oneself, nevertheless seems to come from\nout of the middle of nowhere. For Heidegger, moreover, the\nencounter with a \u201cclearing\u201d in a forest from which all the\ntrees have been removed\u2014that is, an encounter with\nnothing, initially\u2014makes it possible for us to notice\nthe light through which we ordinarily see the forest. In his\nterms, a clearing redirects our attention from entities to being, that\nusually unnoticed ontological light through which things\nordinarily appear. Seeing differently, Heidegger thus suggests,\ncan turn an apparent dead-end into the occasion for an ontological\nepiphany.\n3.4 Seeing Differently:  From the Noth-ing of the Nothing to the Essential Strife of Earth and World\n\n\nWith this crucial idea of seeing differently in mind, notice a\nrelated aporia that appears a bit earlier in Heidegger\u2019s\ntext. While developing his phenomenological critique of the way\nthe modern conception of what \u201cthings\u201d are\nimplicitly structures and so distorts the aesthetic understanding of\nart, Heidegger observes that once this \u201csubject-object relation\nis coupled with the conceptual pair form-matter,\u201d and this\nconceptual matrix is combined with the\n\u201crational/irrational\u201d and \u201clogical/illogical\u201d\ndichotomies,\n\n\nthen representation has at its command a conceptual machinery which\nnothing can stand against [eine Begriffsmechanik, der nichts\nwiderstehen kann]. (PLT 27/GA5 12)\n\n\nHeidegger seems to mean us to take his words seriously:\nAesthetic representation now possesses \u201ca conceptual machinery\nwhich nothing can stand against.\u201d Taken seriously, however,\nthese words leave no room for Heidegger\u2019s hope of transcending\naesthetics. We reach a dead-end, that is, until we hear these\nwords differently, as suggesting instead that (the) nothing can indeed\nstand against the otherwise irresistible conceptual machinery of\naesthetics.\n\n\nThat might sound bizarre at first, but remember that, for Heidegger,\nthe nothing is not nothing at all but, rather, does something;\n\u201cthe nothing itself noths or nihilates [das Nichts selbst\nnichtet]\u201d [P 90/GA9 114], as he notoriously put it\nin\n 1929.[53]\nThis active \u201cnoth-ing\u201d of the nothing was the first name\nHeidegger came up with to describe the phenomenological manifestation\nof that which both elicits and eludes complete conceptualization, an\ninitially inchoate phenomenon we encounter when we go beyond our\nguiding conception of what-is. To experience this\n\u201cnoth-ing\u201d is to become attuned to something which is not a\nthing (hence \u201cnothing\u201d) but which conditions all our\nexperiences of things, something which fundamentally informs our worlds\nbut which we experience primarily as what escapes and so defies our\n\u201csubjectivistic\u201d impulse to extend our conceptual mastery\nover everything.  With the help of Heidegger\u2019s strange\nthought that only this \u201cnothing\u201d can stand against the\nconceptual machinery of aesthetics, we are now poised to understand his\nphenomenological interpretation of Van Gogh\u2019s painting.\n\n\nTo turn a dead-end into a clearing one has to see it\ndifferently. Notice how Heidegger looks at Van Gogh\u2019s\nstill-life painting of a seemingly ordinary pair of well-worn\nshoes. The pivotal point in Heidegger\u2019s meditation takes\nplace when he attends to the fact that \u201c[t]here is nothing\nsurrounding this pair of farmer\u2019s shoes\u201d (PLT\n33/GA5\n 18\u20139).[54]\nAlthough all the English translations obscure this (and no other\ninterpreters seem to notice it), it is clear that for Heidegger this\nnothing is not nothing at all. Heidegger literally\nsays:\n\n\nSurrounding this pair of farmer\u2019s shoes there is nothing, in\nwhich and to which they can belong\u2026 [Um dieses Paar\nBauernschuhe herum ist nichts, wozu und wohin sie geh\u00f6ren\nk\u00f6nnten\u2026] (PLT 33/GA5 18\u20139)\n\n\nHeidegger thrice introduces Van Gogh\u2019s painting of \u201cA\nPair of Shoes\u201d by employing the word \u201cnothing\u201d in\nprecisely this ambiguous way; as we will see, this is how he begins\nevery extended discussion of Van Gogh\u2019s painting. The\ncrucial phenomenological question, then, is: What would it mean\nto really see this \u201cnothing,\u201d to encounter it not as\nnothing at all but, quite differently, as that \u201cin which and to\nwhich\u201d the shoes can indeed\n belong?[55]\n\n\nIf, following Heidegger, one attends long enough to the\n\u201cnothing surrounding this pair of farmer\u2019s shoes,\u201d\nmeditating (with sufficient patience and\n care)[56]\non \u201cthe undefined\nspace\u201d (PLT 33/GA5 19) in Van Gogh\u2019s\n painting\u2014the strange space which surrounds these shoes like an underlying and yet also enveloping atmosphere\u2014one\ncan notice that inchoate\nforms begin to emerge from the background but never quite take a firm\nshape; in fact, these shapes tend to disappear when one tries to pin\nthem\n down.[57]\nThe background of the painting not only\ninconspicuously supports the foreground image of the shoes but, when we\nturn our attention to this ordinarily inconspicuous background, we can\nnotice that it continues to offer up other inchoate shapes which resist\nbeing firmly gestalted themselves. This intriguing phenomenon is\nmore obvious in some of Van Gogh\u2019s other paintings; that Van Gogh\nseems to have embedded his own hat-wearing visage into the sole light\nthat illuminates his famous\n \u201cCaf\u00e9 Terrace at Night\u201d\nis perhaps easiest to see. It is clear that\n\u201cVincent recognized that something important happened in the old\nshoes painting, for he went on to experiment several times with the\ntheme\u201d (Edwards 2004, p. 51), and if one studies another of Van\nGogh\u2019s paintings of\n \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d\n(this one from the following year, 1887), it\nseems hard to miss the faces half-emerging from the background in the\nupper-right corner of the painting, or the Christ-like figure in the\nupper-left.[58]\n\n\n\nHeidegger later described this phenomenon as \u201cthe tension of\nemerging and not emerging,\u201d and it is central to his remarks on\nthe painting of C\u00e9zanne and\n Klee.[59]\nAs Young nicely shows,\nHeidegger especially admired Klee\u2019s later works, such as\n\u201cSaint from a Window\u201d (1940), in which the eponymous image\nin the foreground barely manages to emerge from the muted cacophony of\nother images half-suggesting themselves from the\n background.[60]\nHere the\ntension between emerging and withdrawing is almost as palpable as the\ncentral figure, which seems to be disappearing back into the subtly\ndynamic background from which other figures continue to suggest\nthemselves. In a note he made beneath a sketch of Klee\u2019s\n\u201cSaint from a Window,\u201d Heidegger asks: \u201cIf one\nerases the \u2018image\u2019-character [from a picture], what [is\nleft] to \u2018see\u2019?\u201d He answers in another note by\nquoting Klee himself: \u201cThe inner structure organizing the\npicture itself thus begins to come to the fore\u2014and come toward\ntruth, co\u00fbte que co\u00fbte [whatever\nthe\n cost].\u201d[61]\nFor Heidegger, to put it simply,\nKlee\u2019s late paintings preserve the phenomenological struggle of\nemerging and withdrawing, and so bring the usually inconspicuous\ntension between foreground and background itself to the fore, thereby\noffering us a glimpse of the underlying structure hidden within all\nart. This phenomenological \u201ctension of emerging and not\nemerging\u201d that Heidegger finds in Klee and C\u00e9zanne,\nhowever, he first discovered in Van Gogh\u2019s painting of \u201cA\nPair of Shoes,\u201d specifically, in the way Van Gogh\u2019s\npainting manifests what \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d\nfamously calls \u201cthe essential strife\u201d between \u201cearth\nand world\u201d (PLT 49/GA5 35).\n\n\nWe can encounter this phenomenological \u201cstrife\u201d for\nourselves if we can recognize the way in which what initially seems\nlike \u201cnothing\u201d in the background of Van Gogh\u2019s\npainting continues to tantalizingly offer itself to our understanding\nwhile also receding from our attempts to order what it offers us into\nany firm, settled meaning. Thus, when Heidegger defines the\nphenomenon of \u201cearth\u201d as \u201cthe essentially\nself-secluding\u201d (PLT 47/GA5 33), he quickly qualifies this\ndefinition by specifying that:\n\n\nThe self-seclusion of earth is not a uniform, inflexible staying\nunder cover; rather, it unfolds itself in an inexhaustible abundance of\nsimple modes and shapes [eine unersch\u00f6pfliche\nF\u00fclle einfacher Weisen und Gestalten]. (PLT 47/GA5\n34)\n\n\n\u201cEarth,\u201d in other words, is an inherently dynamic\ndimension of intelligibility that simultaneously offers itself to and\nresists being fully brought into the light of our \u201cworlds\u201d\nof meaning and permanently stabilized therein, despite our best\nefforts. These very efforts to bring the earth\u2019s\n\u201cinexhaustible abundance of simple modes and shapes\u201d\ncompletely into the light of our worlds generates what Heidegger calls\nthe \u201cessential strife\u201d between \u201cearth\u201d and\n\u201cworld\u201d:\n\n\nThe world grounds itself on the earth and the earth juts through the\nworld. \u2026The world, in resting upon the earth, strives to\nraise the earth completely [into the light]. As self-opening, the\nworld cannot endure anything closed. The earth, however, as\nsheltering and concealing, tends always to draw the world into itself\nand keep it there. (PLT 49/GA5 35)\n\n\nIn Heidegger\u2019s view, then, for a great artwork to\nwork\u2014that is, for it to help focus and preserve a\nmeaningful \u201cworld\u201d for an\n audience[62]\u2014this\nartwork must\nmaintain an essential tension between the world of meanings it\npulls together and the more mysterious phenomenon of the\n\u201cearth.\u201d Earth, in his analysis, both\ninforms and sustains this meaningful world and also resists being\ninterpretively exhausted by it, thereby allowing a great artwork\nquietly to maintain the sanctity of the inexhaustible within the very\nworld of meanings it conveys.\n\n\nLike that notorious \u201cnothing\u201d which (Heidegger wrote in\n1929) \u201cmakes possible the manifestation of entities as such for\nhuman existence [or \u2018being-here,\u2019 Dasein]\u201d\n(P 91/GA9 115), the \u201cearth\u201d is thus Heidegger\u2019s name\nin 1935\u201336 for what he most frequently calls \u201cbeing as\nsuch,\u201d a dynamic phenomenological \u201cpresencing\u201d\n(Anwesen) which gives rise to our worlds of meaning without\never being exhausted by them, a dimension of intelligibility we\nexperience both as it informs and as it escapes our attempts to pin\nit\n down.[63]\nWhat this suggests, then, is that by 1935 Heidegger had become\ndissatisfied with his broadly misunderstood \u201cnothing noths\u201d\nterminology, and so seeks here to redescribe and more carefully elaborate\nthe mysterious phenomenon he had called the \u201cnoth-ing\u201d six\nyears earlier as the \u201cessentially self-secluding earth,\u201d\nthe self-seclusion of which becomes palpable in its resistance to our\nbest efforts to bring the phenomenon fully into the light of our\nworlds. We can even observe this refining redescription taking\nplace in Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of Van Gogh.\n3.5 From the Phenomenology of Van Gogh\u2019s Painting to the Ontology of Art\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s most famous presentation of Van Gogh\u2019s\npainting pivots again on an ambiguous use of \u201cnothing,\u201d to\nwhich Heidegger now adds an elliptical, intimating locution (\u201cAnd\nyet\u2026\u201d) in order to encourage his audience to hear a subtle\nshift and so notice the meaning suggested by his otherwise superfluous\naddition, \u201cand nothing more.\u201d Heidegger\u2019s use\nof this ambiguous locution (\u201cand nothing more\u201d) was a\nwell-established rhetorical trope for him by 1935; it was his preferred\nmethod for introducing the idea of that \u201cnothing\u201d we\nencounter when we move beyond the totality of entities toward that\nwhich makes it possible to encounter these entities the way we\ndo. Heidegger had established the pattern in 1929\u2019s\n\u201cWhat Is Metaphysics?\u201d by deliberately employing just such\nambiguous locutions seven times in a row, referring to \u201cthe\nentity itself\u2014and nothing besides [und sonst\nnichts],\u201d \u201cthe entity itself\u2014and nothing further\n[und weiter nichts],\u201d \u201cthe entity itself\u2014and\nbeyond that, nothing,\u201d etc., and then driving the point home with\nthe rhetorical question: \u201cIs this only a manner of\nspeaking\u2014and nothing besides?\u201d (P 84/GA9 105)\n\n\nSeen in this light, the fact that Heidegger repeats the same\nrhetorical strategy when he introduces Van Gogh\u2019s painting\nbecomes unmistakable:\n\n\n A pair of farmer\u2019s shoes and nothing more. And yet.\n[Ein Paar Bauernschuhe und nichts weiter. Und dennoch.]\n\n\nFrom out of the dark opening of the worn insides of the shoes the\ntoilsome tread of the worker stares forth\u2026 The shoes\nvibrate with the silent call of the earth, its quiet gift of the\nripening grain [i.e., \u201cearth\u201d makes \u201cworld\u201d\npossible by inconspicuously giving itself to the world] and\nthe earth\u2019s unexplained self-refusal in the fallow desolation of\nthe wintry field [i.e., it is also constitutive of earth that it\nresists this world by receding back into itself]. (PLT\n33\u20134/GA5 19)\n\n\n\nAs the editorial insertions suggest, the point of Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenological interpretation of Van Gogh\u2019s painting of the\nshoes is not to engage in an armchair anthropology of farming but,\nrather, to suggest that attending to the \u201cnothing\u201d in Van\nGogh\u2019s painting reveals the deepest level of \u201ctruth\u201d\nat work in art, namely, the essential tension in which the\nphenomenologically abundant \u201cearth\u201d simultaneously makes\npossible and also resists being finally mastered or fully expressed\nwithin the \u201cworld.\u201d\n\n\nWhen attending to the mysterious nothing allows us to recognize the\ndynamic tension between \u201cearth\u201d and \u201cworld\u201d\npreserved in Van Gogh\u2019s painting, then we have thereby\nencountered what is for Heidegger the inner tension at the heart of\nart, a tension which not only drives art and keeps it alive but also\nallows humanity\u2019s understanding of being to unfold\nhistorically. \u201cArt\u201d in this essential\nsense\u2014which Heidegger also calls \u201cpoetry\u201d or\npoiesis, that is, bringing into being\u2014can be\nunderstood as an unending creative struggle to express that which\nconditions and informs our worlds of meaning and yet resists being\nexhaustively articulated in the terms of these\n worlds.[64]\nThe conflict preserved\nin Van Gogh\u2019s painting\u2014between emerging into the light and\nreceding into the darkness, revealing and withdrawing, \u201cemerging\nand not emerging\u201d\u2014is thus for Heidegger the basic structure\nof intelligibility as it takes place in time.\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s description of this essential conflict between\nearth and world should be understood as his attempt to elaborate\nphenomenologically his enduring ontological understanding of truth as\nthe inherently agonistic manifestation of a-l\u00eatheia,\nthat is, \u201ctruth\u201d conceived ontologically as\nhistorically-variable \u201cun-concealment\u201d or\n\u201cdis-closure.\u201d It is, we could say, the\nhyphen in a-l\u00eatheia\u2014the joining together,\nliterally \u201cunder one\u201d (hypo + hen), of\nrevealing and concealing\u2014that Heidegger develops as the essential\nstrife between world and\n earth.[65]\nWith world and earth, in other words,\nHeidegger seeks to name and so render visible the quietly conflictual\nstructure at the heart of intelligibility, the unified opposition that\nallows \u201cbeing\u201d to be \u201cdis-closed\u201d in\ntime. Since Being and Time at least, Heidegger had\ninsisted on the \u201cequiprimordiality\u201d or\n\u201cco-originality\u201d (Gleichurspr\u00fcnglichkeit) of\n\u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cuntruth\u201d (BT 265/SZ 222), building\non Husserl\u2019s phenomenological axiom that the emergence of one\nthing or aspect of a thing into intelligibility requires the concealing\nof another. (Taken to its extreme, this axiom allows Heidegger to\nsuggest that the totality of what-is stands in the place of and so\nconceals the \u201cnothing\u201d from which it\n emerges.)[66]\nFor\nHeidegger, the fact that there can be no revealing without concealing\n(and vice versa) is a necessary feature not just of perception or\ncognition but of intelligibility in\n general.[67]\n\n\n\nThe truth disclosed by Van Gogh\u2019s particular\n(\u201contic\u201d) work of art is thus ontological.\nThat is, the tension between emerging and withdrawing that is visible\nin Van Gogh\u2019s painting implicitly conditions all artistic\ncreation, which (we have seen) means all bringing-into-being, that is,\nall historical intelligibility. Heidegger thus goes so far as to\nclaim that:\n\n\nThe world is the self-disclosing openness of the broad paths of the\nsimple and essential decisions in the destiny of an historical\npeople. The earth is the spontaneous forthcoming of that which is\ncontinually self-secluding and to that extent sheltering and\nconcealing. World and earth are essentially different from one\nanother and yet are never separated\u2026 The work-being of the\nwork consists in the fighting of the battle [der Bestreitung des\nStreites] between world and earth. (PLT 49/GA5 35\u20136)\n\n\nAs \u201cearth,\u201d in other words, intelligibility\ntantalizingly offers previously unglimpsed aspects of itself to our\nunderstanding and yet also withdraws from our attempts to order those\naspects into a single fixed meaning. As \u201cworld,\u201d we\nstruggle nevertheless to force a stable ordering onto this\ninexhaustible phenomenological abundance, however temporarily. In\nthis way, \u201cearth\u201d both supports and resists\n\u201cworld,\u201d tantalizingly eliciting, always informing,\nand yet also partly escaping all our attempts to finally stabilize our\nintelligible worlds, to assign a firm shape to things once and for\nall.\n\n\nThe \u201cessential strife\u201d of this a-l\u00eatheiac\nstruggle between concealing and revealing, earth and world, is\nprecisely what Heidegger thinks Van Gogh renders visible in his\npainting of \u201cA Pair of\n Shoes.\u201d[68]\nWhat we can thus learn\nfrom a work of art like Van Gogh\u2019s painting\u2014in which this\nusually inconspicuous tension is masterfully preserved and\nconveyed\u2014is that our intelligible worlds are shaped by what we\ntake from and make of a dynamic phenomenological abundance that we can\nnever fully grasp or finally\n master.[69]\nBy partly informing and yet always also\npartly eluding our attempts to order those aspects the earth offers to\nour understanding into a single, final historical \u201cworld,\u201d\nthe abundant earth preserves itself for future orderings, for worlds\nstill yet to be\n disclosed.[70]\n3.6 Representing Nothing:  Transcending Aesthetic Subjectivism from Within\n\n\nFor Heidegger, then, the essential tension between\n\u201cworld\u201d and \u201cearth\u201d\u2014the dynamic\nback-and-forth whereby some things (or aspects of things) cannot emerge\ninto the light of our intelligible worlds without others withdrawing\ninto the background (which means that it is impossible for everything to take place\nin intelligibility all at once)\u2014names the basic conflict in the\nstructure of intelligibility, a conflict which is ultimately\n responsible for the historical unfolding of what\n is.[71]\nOnce we\nrealize this, we can see that Heidegger\u2019s only other major\nreference to Van Gogh\u2019s painting (in 1935\u2019s The\nIntroduction to Metaphysics) again follows the same basic sequence\nof phenomenological steps. This important passage turns once more\non the double meaning of (the) \u201cnothing\u201d (which Heidegger\nagain seeks to suggest with the subtly ambiguous locution,\n\u201cnothing else\u201d):\n\n\nA painting by Van Gogh: a pair of tough farmer\u2019s shoes,\nnothing else [sonst nichts]. The picture really\nrepresents nothing [Das Bild stellt eigentlich nichts\ndar]. Yet, what is there, with that you are\nimmediately alone, as if on a late autumn evening, when the last potato\nfires have burned out, you yourself were heading wearily home from the\nfield with your hoe. (IM 37\u20138/GA40 38)\n\n\nReaders often take Heidegger\u2019s deliberately provocative claim\nthat \u201c[t]he picture really represents nothing\u201d as a\nflat-footed assertion that Van Gogh\u2019s painting does not\nrepresent\n shoes.[72]\nBut that obscures Heidegger\u2019s deeper point and, in fact, would\nmake no more sense than if, beneath\n \u201cThe Treason of Images\u201d\n(1929)\u2014Magritte\u2019s realistic\nrepresentation of a pipe against a blank background\u2014 Magritte had painted not the famous words, \u201cThis is not a pipe [Ceci\nn\u2019est pas une pipe]\u201d but\ninstead: \u201cThis is not\na representation of a pipe.\u201d For, Magritte\u2019s\nmost obvious point is that a representation of a pipe (be it pictorial\nor linguistic) is not itself a pipe. The surreal effect of\n\u201cThe Treason of Images\u201d comes from the way it encourages\nviewers to confront the usually unnoticed distance between\nrepresentations and the things they represent. \u201cThis is not\na pipe\u201d calls the very obviousness of representation into\nquestion, and so points toward the mysteries concealed beneath the\nsystem of representation we usually take for\n granted.[73]\n\n\nThe effect of Heidegger\u2019s provocative claim about Van\nGogh\u2019s painting of \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d is\nsimilar. When Heidegger states that \u201c[t]he picture really\nrepresents nothing,\u201d he is not advancing the bizarre claim that\nVan Gogh\u2019s painting of a pair of shoes does not represent\nshoes. The fact that Van Gogh\u2019s painting represents shoes\nis the first thing anyone notices about it and it is also (as we have\nseen) the first thing Heidegger himself mentioned about it: Van\nGogh\u2019s picture \u201crepresents [darstellt] a pair of\nfarmer\u2019s shoes\u201d (PLT 19/GA5 3). Heidegger is not\nretracting that claim but, instead, building upon it, suggesting that\nVan Gogh\u2019s painting does more than just represent a pair of\nshoes: Van Gogh\u2019s painting \u201creally, properly, or\nauthentically\u201d (eigentlich) represents (the)\nnothing. Indeed, it represents (the) nothing in a way that\nultimately allows us to transcend aesthetic representation from\nwithin\u2014by getting us back in touch with a more basic level of\nhuman existence which the order of objective representations\npresupposes but cannot fully\n recapture.[74]\n\n\nThe suggestively ambiguous phrase, \u201cnothing out of the\nordinary,\u201d might make a good title for Heidegger\u2019s attempt\nto show how the mysterious \u201cnothing\u201d emerges from Van\nGogh\u2019s painting of a seemingly ordinary pair of shoes. For\nHeidegger, it is not that the person who broke in these empty shoes,\nalthough absent from the painting, nevertheless remains present there\nin his or her very absence. It is true, as Edwards (2004, p. 54)\nsuggests, that the palpable presence of the missing person whose feet\nshaped the shoes that Van Gogh painted quite naturally leads those who\nstudy the painting carefully to wonder, Whose shoes\nwere these originally? And that question, in turn, helps fuel the\ncontroversy that still surrounds Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of\nthe painting (see section 4). For Heidegger, however, the\n\u201cnothing\u201d that is visible in Van Gogh\u2019s painting is\nnot the haunting presence of these shoes\u2019 absent owner but,\ninstead, the equally paradoxical (and no less phenomenologically\ndiscernible) appearance of that which is neither an entity nor merely\nnothing at all and yet conditions our experience of all\nentities.  We can encounter this active nothing phenomenologically as we learn to be receptive to the textural hints of that which is not yet a thing and yet offers itself, in the suggestive hints of a \u201coutline\u201d or \u201crift-structure\u201d, beckoning to be gestated and so brought into being by our disclosive capacities.\n\n\nWhat Heidegger finally wants to suggest, then, is not just that\nthe nothing emerges from the ordinary (that the nothing makes itself\nvisible in Van Gogh\u2019s painting of an ordinary pair of shoes) but\nalso the reverse, that what we now think of as \u201cordinary\u201d\nfirst originated out of the \u201cnothing,\u201d through the\nessential struggle between earth and world. For, in\nHeidegger\u2019s view, initially extraordinary creations, once brought\ninto being, eventually become stabilized in intelligibility and so\nperceived as merely \u201cordinary\u201d (in much the same way that\nwhat begins as a revealing poetic insight is eventually routinized into\na worn-out\n clich\u00e9).[75]\nAs he thus puts it:\n\n\nDoes truth, then, originate out of nothing? In fact it does,\nif by \u201cnothing\u201d we mean no more than that which is not a\nbeing, and if \u201ca being\u201d represents that which is\nobjectively on hand [Vorhandene] in the normal way\u2014a\n[way of conceiving] \u201cbeing,\u201d the merely putative truth of\nwhich comes to light and thereby becomes shattered by the\nstanding-there of the work. (PLT 71/GA5 59)\n\n\nIn other words, the encounter with the nothing in the work of art\n\u201cshatters\u201d the taken-for-granted obviousness of the modern\ntheoretical framework in which subjects seek to master external\nobjects, a framework implicit in the basic aesthetic view according to\nwhich subjects undergo intensive experiences of art objects. The\nphenomenological encounter with Van Gogh\u2019s painting undermines\nthe obviousness of the modern worldview by returning us directly to the\nprimordial level of engaged existence in which subject and object have\nnot yet been differentiated. Indeed, Heidegger thinks that\naesthetics transcends itself from within in the encounter with Van\nGogh\u2019s painting because this encounter with the work of art\nbrings us back to this engaged level of existence in a particularly\nlucid and revealing way. This lucid encounter, moreover, is\nsupposed to help us transform our guiding sense of what beings are,\nleading us beyond both the modern and late-modern understandings of\nbeing as objects to be mastered and resources to be optimized.\nBut how exactly?\n\n\nHeidegger thinks we can transcend modern aesthetics from within if,\nin what begins as an ordinary aesthetic experience of an\nobject\u2014Van Gogh\u2019s painting of a pair of shoes\u2014that\nstands opposite us (as if external to our own subjectivity), we notice\nand carefully attend to the way these shoes take shape on and against\nan inconspicuously dynamic background (the \u201cnoth-ing\u201d\nrethought as \u201cearth\u201d), a background which is not nothing at\nall but, rather, both supports and exceeds the intelligible world that\nemerges from\n it.[76]\nOur experience of an aesthetic object\ntranscends itself here because, in order to encounter Van Gogh\u2019s\nartwork in its full phenomenological richness (by recognizing the\nstruggle between \u201cearth and world\u201d that is preserved in the\npainting), we can no longer approach the meaning of this work as if\nthis meaning were entirely contained within an external object standing\napart from us. Our phenomenological encounter with Van\nGogh\u2019s painting shows us that its meaning is neither located\nentirely in the object standing over against us nor is it simply\nprojected by our subjectivity onto an inherently meaningless work; the\nwork\u2019s meaning must instead be inconspicuously accomplished in\nour own engagement with the work. Through our engagement with Van\nGogh\u2019s painting, Heidegger suggests, we lucidly encounter the\nnegotiation by which we are always-already making sense of the\nworld.\n\n\nIt is crucial for Heidegger that we not reinterpret this encounter\nas a subject\u2019s selective cognitive and perceptual uptake of an\nobjective world. What we encounter in art is something more\ndeeply rooted in existence which the modern subject/object dichotomy\nskates right over. Our encounter with the work teaches us that\nthat meaning does not happen solely in the art object or the viewing\nsubject but instead takes place, we could say, between us and\nthe work. This, again, is an ontological truth; it holds\ntrue of (human) existence in general. To be Dasein is to\nbe \u201cthe being of the \u2018between\u2019\u201d (HCT\n251/GA20 346\u20137), as Heidegger first put it in 1925.\nThis means that our encounter with Van Gogh\u2019s painting helps us\nto realize and so become what we are. For, what we\nlucidly encounter in art is our making-sense of the place in which we\nfind ourselves, a fundamental \u201cworld-disclosing\u201d that is\nalways already at work in human \u201cexistence,\u201d our\nstanding-out into intelligibility. For Heidegger, Van\nGogh\u2019s painting allows us to lucidly encounter what we already\nare, most fundamentally, but without realizing it\u2014namely,\nDasein, \u201cbeing-here,\u201d the active making\nintelligible of the place in which we find ourselves. Art teaches\nus to become what we already are by allowing us lucidly to undergo the\ntransition from understanding and experiencing ourselves as\nmeaning-bestowing subjects standing over against an objective world to\nrecognizing that, at a deeper level, we are always implicitly\nparticipating in the making-intelligible of our\n worlds.[77]\n3.7 Heidegger\u2019s Post-Modern Understanding of Art\n\n\nThis implicit struggle whereby being becomes intelligible in time,\nwe have seen, is the very essence of art, the \u201cpoetic\u201d\nheart of creation responsible for both providing and renewing our sense\nof what-is. As Heidegger puts it:\n\n\neverything with which humanity is endowed must, in the [poetic]\nprojection [that \u201cbrings-into-being\u201d or makes things newly\nintelligible], be drawn up from out of the closed ground [i.e., from\nthe \u201cearth\u201d understood as the untapped possibilities still\nconcealed within the tradition] and set upon this ground.\n(PLT 75\u20136/GA5 63)\n\n\nHumanity\u2019s ontological \u201cendowment\u201d (our sense of\nwhat entities are) comes from the poetic\n\u201cnaming-into-being\u201d (or making intelligible) at the heart\nof art. Moreover, Heidegger adds (showing that he was indeed a\nconservative revolutionary, in 1936 at least), Western humanity\u2019s\nsense of being can only be changed historically through the creative\ndiscovery of possibilities hidden within the tradition that has come\ndown to us. Only by discovering the tradition\u2019s hidden\nheritage can we hope to reshape our communal sense of what is and what\nmatters, thereby redrawing the basic contours of this tradition and so\ncreating new possibilities for human understanding and action. In\nthis way, for Heidegger, art remains capable of redrawing the lines\nthat establish our basic sense of what-is and what matters.\n\n\nFor art to accomplish this revolutionary task, however, the artist\nmust be able to see something beginning to take shape where others see\nnothing at all. All great creators must be able to discern the\ninchoate contours of something previously unseen and, as if thus\nplaying midwife to being, help draw it into the light of the\nworld.\n\n\nBecause it is such a drawing, all creation is a drawing-up (like\ndrawing water from a well). Modern subjectivism, of course,\nmisinterprets creation as the product of the genius of the\nself-sovereign subject [and so imagines that a genius creates ex\nnihilo, by simply projecting his or her subjectivity onto an\notherwise meaningless world]. \u2026The poeticizing projection comes\nout of nothing in the sense that it never derives its gift from what is\nfamiliar and already there. But in another sense it does not come\nout of nothing; for what it projects is only the withheld determination\nof historical existence [Dasein] itself. (PLT 76/GA5\n63\u20134)\n\n\nAs this suggests, at the very core of Heidegger\u2019s\nunderstanding of art is an encounter with a \u201cnothing\u201d that\nis not simply nothing at all but, rather, designates possible meanings\nstill concealed within the tradition, which preserves historical\nintelligibility as it has come down to us. The inchoate contours\nof that which is not yet a thing need to be drawn out in an original\nway in order to release the possibilities inherent in the tradition and\nso create or renew humanity\u2019s ontological inheritance for the\nfuture. In other words, artistic creation requires the exercise\nof an active receptivity we might call ontological\nresponse-ability, that is, an ability to respond to the\ninchoate ways in which being offers itself to intelligibility.\nFor, only such an ability will prove capable (in Heidegger\u2019s\nterms) of bringing that which was hidden in the \u201cnoth-ing\u201d\n(or still slumbering in the \u201cearth\u201d) into the light of our\nhistorical worlds.\n\n\nTo participate in such creation, the artist needs to be receptive to\nwhat \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d calls the\n\u201crift-design\u201d or \u201cfissure\u201d (Ri\u00df)\nthat joins the world to the earth. By \u201ccreatively\u201d\nand selectively responding to the abundance of ways in which being\ngenuinely offers itself to us, the artist establishes one of these\npossibilities, bringing it into the light of day for the first time,\njust as Michelangelo legendarily spent weeks carefully studying the\nsubtle network of veins and fissures running through that famous piece\nof marble before he could set his \u201cDavid\u201d free from the\nstone. This is not to say that David was the only possible form\nslumbering in that particular piece of marble; the rifts and fissures\nrunning through it might have been taken up by the artist and\ncreatively gestalted in other ways, thereby giving birth to other, more\nor less different\n sculptures.[78]\nIn any such case, however, \u201cthe\nestablishing of truth in the work is the bringing forth of a being such\nas never was before and will never come to be again\u201d (PLT 62/GA5\n50). In artistic creation, the artist responds to what offers itself,\ncreatively discerning and helping to realize the outlines of a new\nworld in the manifold possibilities offered up by the\n earth.[79]\n As Heidegger puts it:\n\n\nThere certainly lies hidden in nature a rift-design, a measure and\nborder, and, tied to it, a capacity for bringing-forth\u2014that is,\nart. But it is equally certain that this art hidden in nature\nbecomes manifest only through the work, because it is lodged\noriginarily in the work. (PLT 70/GA5 58)\n\n\nIn Heidegger\u2019s view, then, all great artists learn to\nrecognize and respond to the complex texture of edges, lines, and\nbreaks which together constitute an open-ended \u201cbasic\ndesign\u201d or \u201coutline sketch\u201d (PLT 63/GA5 51), which\nthe artist then creatively gestalts in order to bring at least one of\nthe \u201cinexhaustible\u201d shapes still hidden in the earth into\nthe light of the world.\n\n\nTo gestalt the hints nature offers us in one way is necessarily not\nto gestalt them in another, but Heidegger thinks that Van Gogh\u2019s\npainting of the shoes preserves the hints of other possible gestalts in\nits quietly dynamic tension between what clearly takes shape in the\nforeground and what recedes into the background. For, in Van\nGogh\u2019s painting, what recedes into the phenomenological\nbackground does so in such a way that, rather than completely\ndisappearing behind the foreground image, it continues to manifest a\ncomplex texture of rifts and fissures that suggest the possibility of\nother gestalts, new ways of drawing out what simultaneously offers\nitself to and withdraws from our grasp, even ones that challenge the\nhabitual ways in which we have come to see things (as an ordinary pair\nof shoes, for example). As Heidegger thus puts it, a truly great\nartistic \u201cbeginning\u2026always contains the undisclosed\nabundance of the unfamiliar and extraordinary, which means that it\nalso contains the strife with the familiar and the ordinary\u201d (PLT\n76/GA5 64).\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s view that the hints intelligibility offers us can\nbe gestalted in more than one way makes him an ontological\npluralist (or plural realist), but he does not\nbelieve that just anything goes. As his thoughts on the\n\u201crift-structure\u201d permeating intelligibility suggest,\nHeidegger firmly believes that there is a coming into being in nature\nitself which the bringing into being through art should serve.\nThis means that there must be limits on what the artist can creatively\nimpose that arise from the matter itself. The\n\u201cabundant\u201d dimension of intelligibility Heidegger calls\n\u201cearth\u201d has to genuinely resist the artist\u2019s creative\nefforts to bring it into the light of the world at some point (or\npoints), or else art would just be a frictionless subjective projection\nor hallucination (or even a deeper ontological destructiveness\nmasquerading as creativity), rather than an ontologically-maieutic\ngestalting that finds a genuinely creative way to be grounded in and\ntruly responsive to the ways things show themselves. The\nimportance of acknowledging that there is always something in\nintelligibility that resists our merely subjective designs (and not\nCarnap\u2019s famous critique) seems to be the main reason Heidegger\nstopped talking about the \u201cnothing\u201d and began referring to\nthe \u201cearth.\u201d All genuine creativity, all\nbringing-into-being, must learn to recognize and respect (what we could\nthink of as) the texture of the text with which it works. This\nmean that all artists\u2014indeed, all those who would\nbring-into-being in a meaningful way, whatever media they work\nwith\u2014must learn to draw creatively upon an elusive and excessive dimension of being\nthat cannot be entirely appropriated, finally mastered, or\ndefinitively manipulated.[80]\n\n\nHeidegger thus implicitly contrasts two drastically different ways\nof comporting ourselves toward that which shows itself to\nus\u2014namely, the active receptivity of a genuinely\n\u201cpost-modern\u201d responsiveness to the phenomenological\n\u201cabundance\u201d of being, on the one hand, and, on the other,\nthe endless domination of modern subjectivism (which treats everything\nas an object to be mastered) or, even worse, the obtuse reductiveness\nof late-modern enframing (which understands and so relates to\neverything as an intrinsically-meaningless resource to be\noptimized). Perhaps the easiest way to understand the difference\nbetween the poetic and technological modes of revealing Heidegger\ncontrasts is to think in terms of the ancient Greek distinction between\npoiesis and techn\u00ea. Simply think, first,\nof a poetic midwifery that respects and seeks to draw out the natural\npotentialities of the matters with which it works, as Michelangelo\nlegendarily freed his \u201cDavid\u201d from the\nmarble or, less hyperbolically put, as a skillful woodworker notices\nthe inherent qualities of particular pieces of wood (attending to\nsubtleties of shape and grain, shades of color, weight, and hardness),\nwhile deciding what (or even whether) to build from that wood. In\nthe same way, Heidegger contends, \u201c[t]he authentic interpretation\nmust show what does not stand there in the words and yet is said\nnevertheless\u201d (IM 173/GA40 171). For Heidegger, as this\nsuggests, an \u201cauthentic\u201d hermeneutics must work creatively\nto bring forth the hidden riches of a text in the same way that a true\nwoodworker learns to \u201canswer and respond above all to the\ndifferent kinds of wood and to the shapes slumbering within\nwood\u2014to wood as it enters into human dwelling with all the hidden\nriches of its nature\u201d (WCT 14/GA8 17).  Our creative yet responsive disclosure of such hermeneutic possibilities is what Heidegger calls \u201cpreservation,\u201d because it works to keep the world opened by the work alive historically as a way of seeing and understanding.\n\n\nThe distinctive character of this post-modern responsiveness to the\nabundance of being stands out most clearly when we contrast it with our\ndefining late-modern tendency toward the kind of technological making\nwhich imposes form on matter without paying any heed to its intrinsic\npotentialities, in the way that, for example, an industrial factory\nindiscriminately grinds wood into woodchips in order to paste them back\ntogether into straight particle board which can then be used flexibly\nto efficiently construct a maximal variety of useful\n objects.[81]\nTo\nemphasize the difference, Heidegger pointedly asks: \u201cBut where in\nthe manipulations of the industrial worker is there any relatedness to\nsuch things as the shapes slumbering within wood?\u201d (WCT 23/GA8\n26) Insofar as such a relatedness cannot be found, something\ncrucial has gone\n missing.[82]\nFor, without such an ontological\nresponsiveness, human beings lose touch with what Heidegger understands\nas the source of meaning. Although our late-modern metaphysics\nleads us to assume that all meaning comes from us, as the result of our\nsubjective \u201cvalue positings,\u201d Heidegger is committed to the\nless subjectivistic and more phenomenologically accurate view that, at\nleast with respect to that which most matters to us (the paradigm case\nbeing love), what we care about most is not entirely up to us,\nnot simply within our power to control, and that this is a crucial part\nof what makes it so\n important.[83]\n\n\nTo learn from art how to understand the being of entities in a\npost-modern way means learning to cultivate and develop the ontological\nresponsiveness that allows us to understand and experience entities as\nbeing richer in meaning than we are capable of doing justice to\nconceptually, rather than taking them as intrinsically meaningless\nresources awaiting optimization. In this way, we can learn to\napproach the humble things that make up our worlds with care, humility,\npatience, gratitude, even\n awe.[84]\nThis subjectivism-humbling lesson in\nontological responsiveness is precisely what Heidegger thinks great art\nlike Van Gogh\u2019s painting of \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d can\nhelp teach\n us.[85]\nIn the contemporaneous \u201cH\u00f6lderlin and the\nEssence of Poetry\u201d (1936), Heidegger argues that the German\nRomantic poet Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin is the \u201cpoet of\npoetry\u201d because H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s poetry expresses\npoetically what poetry is: H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s poetry\nnames-into-being the fact that poetry itself is essentially\na\n naming-into-being.[86]\nIn the same way, \u201cThe Origin of\nthe Work of Art\u201d presents Van Gogh as the painter of\npainting. For Heidegger, Van Gogh is the painter who paints what\npainting really is, because his painting captures and\npreserves that essential tension between revealing and concealing,\n\u201cearth\u201d and \u201cworld,\u201d which is at work in all\nart, indeed, in all creation, all bringing into and\nmaintaining in intelligibility.\n\n\nWhat drew Heidegger to Van Gogh, then, was not just their mutual\naffinity for rural life, their shared awareness of the way its pastoral\nrhythms are rooted in nature\u2019s cycles and bespeak a fundamental\nfaith that hard work can bring forth the earth\u2019s hidden\nbounty. Heidegger seems to have been deeply moved by the way\nhalf-formed figures seem to struggle to take shape in the background of\nVan Gogh\u2019s paintings, less in clear lines than in the thick\ntexture of the paint, brush strokes, and deep fields of color.\n(This is something that, unfortunately, even the most realistic\nrepresentations of his paintings fail fully to convey, which is why\nthere is no substitute for encountering Van Gogh\u2019s paintings in\nperson.) For Heidegger, these two sources of attraction work\ntogether; it is the mysterious bounty of the strife between world and\nearth that comes through in the tension between what shows itself in\nthe foreground and what recedes into the background of Van Gogh\u2019s\npaintings. In Heidegger\u2019s interpretation, Van Gogh\u2019s\npainting preserves the essential strife whereby the \u201cnothing\nnoths,\u201d both calling for and partly eluding conceptualization,\nand his painting thereby allows us to encounter the way the earth both\nyields to and resists our worlds and so, out \u201cof the calm of\ngreat riches, ripens and dispenses what is inexhaustible\u201d (IM\n164/GA40 118).\n4. Conclusion: Resolving the Controversy Surrounding Heidegger\u2019s Interpretation of Van Gogh\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s subtle but ambitious effort to show phenomenologically how\naesthetics can transcend itself from within in an encounter with Van\nGogh\u2019s painting has not been well understood, and Heidegger\u2019s attempt,\nas part of that effort, to link Van Gogh\u2019s painting with the deep\nspiritual wisdom of rural life proved highly controversial (to say the\nleast).  Unfortunately, this controversy has subsequently distracted\nreaders from understanding what Heidegger was really trying to do. By\nworking through this controversy here, however, we can finally resolve\nit, draw its important lessons, and so put it behind us.\n\n\nAs we have seen, Heidegger assumes that the shoes Van Gogh painted\nbelong to a farming woman. The standard but unfortunate\ntranslation of die B\u00e4uerin\u2014literally \u201cthe\nfemale farmer\u201d\u2014as \u201cthe peasant woman\u201d is not\njust classist but misleading. That the shoes disclose the world\nof a farmer is important for Heidegger precisely because the\nfarmer\u2019s world is deeply attuned to the struggle with the earth;\nthe farming woman works the earth daily, caring for, struggling with,\nand ultimately depending on the earth to nurture and bring forth\nher\n harvest.[87]\nHeidegger suggests that no one is more\nimmediately attuned to the struggle between earth and world than the\nexperienced farmer, long intimate with \u201cthe uncomplaining fear as\nto the certainty of bread\u201d as well as \u201cthe wordless joy of\nhaving once more withstood want\u201d (PLT 34/GA5 19). Of\ncourse, farmers forced to abandon their farms in the dust bowl might\nfind Heidegger\u2019s vision of the earth as that which, from out\n\u201cof the calm of great riches, ripens and dispenses what is\ninexhaustible\u201d (IM 164/GA40 118) to be a romantic\nexaggeration. Nevertheless, during the great depression era of\nthe 1930s, \u201cthe earth\u201d really was Heidegger\u2019s chosen\nname for that \u201cinexhaustible\u201d dimension of intelligibility\nexperienced not only by farmers while farming but also by poets while\npoetizing, painters while painting, thinkers while thinking, and,\nindeed, by all those who create by patiently and carefully seeking to\nbring something long nurtured and concealed in a protective darkness\ninto the light of day. That such metaphors also suggest pregnancy\nmight help explain why Heidegger imagines the farmer as a woman,\ndespite the fact that the shoes in Van Gogh\u2019s painting appear\nrather masculine to our contemporary aesthetic sensibilities. Or\nHeidegger might simply have assumed that the shoes belonged to a female\nfarmer because the exhibition in which he originally saw\n Van Gogh\u2019s 1886 painting of \u201cA pair of shoes\u201d\nwas\nprobably populated with some of Van Gogh\u2019s many paintings from\n1885 of women\n engaged in farm work\n(women\n digging in the fields,\n planting,\n harvesting\nand\n peeling potatoes,\nand so on).\n\n\nIn fact, however, we have no way of knowing exactly which paintings\nHeidegger saw at the 1930 exhibit of Van Gogh\u2019s works in\nAmsterdam he later recalled having\n visited.[88]\nThe debate surrounding\nHeidegger\u2019s interpretation of Van Gogh\u2019s painting can be\ntraced back to the fact that initially it is not even clear which\npainting Heidegger is referring to when he invokes an allegedly\n\u201cwell known painting by Van Gogh, who painted such shoes several\ntimes.\u201d  (Here are links to three of them, dated\n Spring 1887, \n early 1887,\n and June 1886.)\n  If Heidegger was aware that Van Gogh painted no fewer than five works \ntitled \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d \nbetween 1886 and 1888, plus several other pairs of wooden farmer\u2019s\n clogs,\n leather clogs,\nand paintings of\n more than one pair of shoes, \n then he does not seem to have thought\nthis fact significant. The art historian who was closest to\nHeidegger, Heinrich Petzet, proposes that the \u201cvarious versions\n[of Van Gogh\u2019s \u2018A Pair of Shoes\u2019] each show the same\nthing,\u201d and this might well be what Heidegger himself thought (if\nhe ever even thought about it): Each of these paintings manifests\nthe struggle between earth and\n world.[89]\nYet, there are lots of other\ndifferences between these paintings; anyone who studies them will\nquickly see that they are not even all paintings of the same pair of\nshoes. Given the subsequent fame of Heidegger\u2019s essay, it\nis quite understandable that both art historians and phenomenologists\nwould want to determine precisely which painting Heidegger was\nreferring to in \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d so as to be\nable to evaluate his interpretation for ourselves. When the\neminent art historian Meyer Schapiro took up the task of identifying the\npainting in the 1960s, however, the mystery over which shoes Heidegger\nwas actually referring to exploded into a whole new controversy.\n\n\nSchapiro wrote to Heidegger to find out where and when he had\nactually seen Van Gogh\u2019s painting; Heidegger, then nearing\neighty, recalled having seen an exhibition in Amsterdam in 1930, so\nSchapiro cross-referenced all the works that could possibly have been\nexhibited there with Heidegger\u2019s own descriptions of the painting\nin his essay. In the end, Schapiro concluded not just that\nHeidegger had melded several paintings together in his memory but that,\nin so doing, Heidegger had mistaken as the shoes of a female farmer\nshoes that in fact belonged to Van Gogh\n himself.[90]\nThe significance of\nSchapiro\u2019s famous criticism has been hotly debated ever\nsince. Art historians have typically taken Schapiro\u2019s claim\nthat Heidegger mistakenly attributed Van Gogh\u2019s own shoes to a\nfarming woman as a devastating objection that pulls the rug right out\nfrom under Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of the painting, whereas\nphilosophers sympathetic to Heidegger often conclude that\nSchapiro\u2019s objection simply misses Heidegger\u2019s\n point.[91]\n(These\nphilosophers thus treat Heidegger\u2019s apparent error of attribution\nas if it were of no more philosophical importance than the remarkably\nsimilar fact that the work Heidegger attributed to Don Scotus in his\nHabilitation thesis was shown subsequently to have been written instead\nby Thomas of\n Erfurt.)[92]\n\n\nTo wit, Dreyfus dismisses the question of who the shoes originally\nbelonged to as \u201cirrelevant to how the picture works\u201d (2005,\np. 409). Although Dreyfus is ultimately right, his dismissal is\nmuch too quick to convince the many who disagree. For,\nSchapiro\u2019s criticism does indeed constitute a devastating\nobjection to Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of Van Gogh, if that\ninterpretation is understood in the standard way. According to\nwhat most readers take to be the sequence of phenomenological steps in\nHeidegger\u2019s interpretation of Van Gogh, Heidegger begins (1) with\nthe assumption that the shoes belong to a farmer, an assumption which\nthen allows him (2) to invoke that struggle with the earth with which\nthe farmer\u2019s world is so closely attuned, so that he can finally\n(3) postulate this earth/world tension as the ontological truth of\nart. On this reconstruction of his argument, however, if\nHeidegger is wrong that the shoes belonged to a farmer then the\nphenomenological bridge he is trying to build between a particular\n(\u201contic\u201d) work of art and the ontological truth of art in\ngeneral would collapse before it even gets off the ground, severed at\nits very first step.\n\n\nIndeed, Heidegger\u2019s entire interpretation of Van Gogh as the\npainter of the ontological truth of painting implodes if its first step\nis merely an idiosyncratic and arbitrary projection on\nHeidegger\u2019s part\u2014or something worse. And this is\nprecisely what Schapiro alleges. As Schapiro delivers his\nverdict:\n\n\nAlas for him, the philosopher has deceived himself. He has\nretained from his encounter with Van Gogh\u2019s canvas a moving set\nof associations with peasants and the soil, which are not sustained by\nthe picture itself. They are grounded rather in his own social\noutlook with its heavy pathos of the primordial and earthy. He\nhas indeed \u201cimagined everything and projected it into the\npainting.\u201d (Schapiro 1968, p. 138)\n\n\nAs this attempt to link Heidegger\u2019s thinking of earth with\n\u201cthe soil\u201d and his \u201csocial outlook\u201d suggests,\nSchapiro\u2019s famous criticism has an obvious political\nsubtext. To put it bluntly, Schapiro is insinuating that Heidegger\nprojected his own National Socialist-tainted associations onto Van\nGogh\u2019s work, then mistook these \u201cblood and soil\u201d\nprojections for the truth of the\n painting.[93]\nEven stripped of the\npolitical subtext that motivates it, this allegation that\nHeidegger\u2019s interpretation of Van Gogh\u2019s painting is really\nnothing more than a projection of Heidegger\u2019s own subjective\nbiases represents a potentially formidable objection to\nHeidegger\u2019s attempt to move beyond the subject/object dichotomy\nat the heart of aesthetics. For, if Heidegger\u2019s\ninterpretation really just covertly reinstalls his own subjective\nperspective, then this attempt to transcend aesthetic subjectivism from\nwithin looks dubious at best.\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s response to this particular objection (which he\nanticipates in \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d) is simply\nto turn it around. Heidegger maintains, in effect, that any\nobjection that he is merely projecting is merely a projection on the\npart of the objector. As he puts it (in the line Schapiro throws\nback at him in the quotation above):\n\n\nIt would be the worst self-deception to believe that our description\nhad first pictured [or imagined, ausgemalt] everything thus as\na subjective act and then projected it onto the painting. (PLT\n35\u20136/GA5 21)\n\n\nHere, however, we seem to reach a deadlock. To Schapiro,\nHeidegger\u2019s anticipatory denial of projection looks like an\nunconscious confession, what Freud called a denegation, that\nis, a disavowal that really confirms the truth of what it denies (the\nclassic example of which is: \u201cI have no idea what my dream\nmeant, Dr. Freud, I only know it was not about\nmy\n mother!\u201d).[94]\nTo Heidegger, Schapiro would seem to\nhave deceived himself in the \u201cworst\u201d way; by projecting\nprojection onto Heidegger\u2019s essay, Schapiro\u2019s interpretation\nwill have been led astray by its own maliciousness. Is there no\nway to avoid leaving the debate in such an unfriendly state, where the\nexplicit avowal of \u201cnot A\u201d is taken as an unconscious\nconfession of \u201cA,\u201d no one\u2019s motives remain above the\nhermeneutics of suspicion, and art interpretation threatens to collapse\ninto the relativism of competing subjective\n projections?[95]\n\n\nThe way out of this impasse is to take Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenology much more seriously, as we have done here. What we\nhave seen is that, rather than just asserting his interpretation of Van\nGogh, Heidegger provides a phenomenological argument for it,\nthat is, a series of steps meant to take his audience from an\nexperience of an \u201contic\u201d work of art to an encounter with\nthe ontological truth of art in general. Insofar as we can personally\nexperience the phenomenological sequence of steps to which Heidegger\nrefers, we ourselves can attest to the truth of his\ninterpretation. (And if we cannot experience that sequence, or we\nexperience something else instead, then we can seek to redescribe,\nrefine, or contest his interpretation for ourselves). Let us thus\nseek to finally resolve this longstanding controversy by summarizing\nand then clarifying the basic sequence of steps in Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenological interpretation of\n Van Gogh\u2019s 1886 painting\n of \u201cA pair of shoes.\u201d\n\n\nWhen Heidegger discusses Van Gogh\u2019s painting of \u201cA Pair\nof Shoes,\u201d we have seen, his analysis takes us from: (1)\nexperiencing Van Gogh\u2019s painting as an aesthetic object (a\npainting of a pair of shoes apparently on hand for our viewing); to (2)\nattending to the nothing (that is, the way the painting\u2019s\nbackground continues to suggest other possibilities which nevertheless\nresist being fully gestalted and so brought into the foreground); to\nthereby (3) encountering the essential tension between earth and world\n(the inconspicuous struggle between revealing and concealing implicit\nin \u201cwhat is there\u201d), and so finally (4) coming to\nsee for oneself what it is like to walk in a farmer\u2019s shoes (by\nencountering for oneself, in the artwork, the struggle to bring the\nbounty of the earth forth into the light of the world). We can\nsee this quite clearly by looking at one of the crucial passages again,\nthis time with the four steps in Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological\ntransition explicitly labeled:\n\n\n[1] A painting by Van Gogh: a pair of tough farmer\u2019s\nshoes, [2] nothing else. The picture really represents\nnothing. [3] Yet, what is there, with that you are\nimmediately alone, [4] as if on a late autumn evening, when the last\npotato fires have burned out, you yourself were heading wearily home\nfrom the field with your hoe. (IM 37\u20138/GA40 38)\n\n\nThese four steps, taken together, form the phenomenological bridge\nthat allows us to move from an interpretation of a particular work of\nart to the ontological truth inherent in all art (indeed, in all\ncoming-into-being). In other words, these are the four steps in\nthe phenomenological argument whereby Heidegger discovers what he calls\nthe a-l\u00eatheiac \u201cessential strife\u201d between\n\u201cearth\u201d and \u201cworld\u201d\u2014that is, the tension\nof emerging and withdrawing implicit in all intelligibility\u2014in\n Van Gogh\u2019s 1886 painting\n of \u201cA pair of shoes\u201d.\n\n\nWe can unpack that third step\u2014and better understand its\nconnection to the fourth\u2014by further examining Heidegger\u2019s\ncuriously specific assertion:\n\n\nYet, what is there, with that you are immediately alone, as\nif on a late autumn evening, when the last potato fires have burned\nout, you yourself were heading wearily home from the field with your\nhoe. (IM 37\u20138/GA40 38)\n\n\nInitially this certainly sounds, as Schapiro alleges, like a highly\nidiosyncratic projection of Heidegger\u2019s own subjective prejudices\nonto Van Gogh\u2019s work. Of course, art historians like\nSchapiro commonly observe that in late works like \u201cA Pair of\nShoes,\u201d Van Gogh seems to devote as much care and attention to\nhis use of color and brush strokes as he does to representing the\nfairly simple subject at the center of the\n painting.[96]\nWhat is so interesting\nfor us about this, however, is that if one attends carefully to what\nemerges from \u201c[o]ut of the dark opening of the well-worn insides\nof shoes\u201d (PLT 33/GA5 19)\u2014attending specifically to the\nlighter patches of color that emerge from the dark opening of the shoe\non the right\u2014one can in fact discern the head (hair bonnet and\nface in profile), torso, and arms of what could easily be a woman,\ncarrying a hoe (a small shovel), with what could even be a small\norange-brown \u201cfire\u201d smoldering behind her. \n\n\nInsofar as we too can discern this \u201clittle old woman who lived\nin the shoe\u201d (as we could call this figure Heidegger seems to\nhave seen), then we can be certain (pace\nDerrida) that Schapiro did in fact correctly identify the precise\npainting Heidegger was discussing: \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d\n(1886). But this also means that Heidegger is not using Van\nGogh\u2019s painting as a jumping off point for his own\nfree-associations (as Schapiro assumes); instead, Heidegger is drawing\ndirectly on his own phenomenological encounter with the painting when\nhe describes \u201cwhat is there\u201d (IM 37\u20138/GA40 38) in\nthe work\u2019s inconspicuous earth/world\n struggle.[97]\nThis would also explain\nwhat Heidegger means when he says (immediately following the quotation\nSchapiro throws back at him):\n\n\nIf anything is questionable here, it is rather that we experienced\ntoo little in the vicinity of the work and that we expressed the\nexperience too crudely and too literally. (PLT 36,\nemphasis added/GA5 21)\n\n\nIf Heidegger was literally describing the figure he saw\nemerging from \u201c[o]ut of the dark opening of the well-worn\ninsides of shoes\u201d (PLT 33/GA5 19) in Van Gogh\u2019s painting of\n\u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d (1886), however, then what Heidegger\noffers us is not merely the projection of his own subjective\nassociations onto a blank canvas but, instead, a meaningful gestalting\nof something from what is really there, something we too can\nphenomenologically confirm for ourselves. (It may help to examine this\ndetail from the shoe on the right-hand side of Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cA\nPair of Shoes\u201d (1886); here the figure of the farming woman\nthat, I argue, Heidegger creatively disclosed \u201c[s]taring forth\nfrom out of the dark opening of the worn insides of the shoes\u201d\n(PLT 33/GA5 19) has been outlined by Mark Wrathall in order to make it\neasier for others to see.)\n\n\nDetail from the shoe on the right side of Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d\n\n\nThis is important, because to make something from what is really\nthere\u2014something which is neither obviously determined by what\noffers itself to us nor simply ignores what offers itself to us in\norder to impose its own subjective idea\u2014this is what all true\nartistic creation does, according to Heidegger\u2019s view (presented\nin section\n 3.7).[98]\nAs we saw, every\n\u201cauthentic\u201d hermeneutics must do this; to interpret any\ngreat work of art, \u201cyou yourself\u201d have to struggle to bring\nforth its hidden riches, just as the farmer must struggle with the\nearth to bring forth the bounty nurtured within it. To engage in\nsuch phenomenological hermeneutics, we might thus say, is to encounter\noneself as a farmer of meaning. For, such an encounter\nallows us to understand for ourselves what it is like when the earth\ncomes to inform our worlds with a genuine, partly independent meaning\nwhich we ourselves brought forth creatively and yet did not simply\nmake-up or project onto the work. When we catch ourselves in the\nact of making-sense of an artwork in this way, then we experience for\nourselves that fundamental making-sense from which, for Heidegger, all\ngenuine meaning ultimately derives.\n\n\nHere, then, we reach the important fourth and final step in\nHeidegger\u2019s phenomenological interpretation, which still needs to\nbe explicitly unpacked and explained. As we saw in sections\n3.5\u20136, Heidegger claims that by experiencing the implicitly dynamic\ntension between earth and world in Van Gogh\u2019s painting, we can\nthereby come to encounter the same primordial level of practical\nmeaning that is unknowingly known by the farmer who uses her shoes\n\u201cwithout noticing or reflecting\u201d on them (PLT 34/GA5\n19). From what has been said, we should now be able to understand\njust how that is supposed to be possible. In our phenomenological\nencounter with Van Gogh\u2019s painting, we catch ourselves in the act\nof struggling to impose a stable world of meanings upon an inherently\ndynamic intelligible domain that both informs and resists this\nworld. To thus find ourselves \u201cworlding the earth\u201d in\nour encounter with art, we have just seen, is to experience for\nourselves essentially the same struggle as the farmer who must struggle\nwith the earth in order to bring forth and maintain her world. In\nour encounter with Van Gogh\u2019s painting, we thus learn for\nourselves what it is like to walk in a farmer\u2019s shoes (where\nearth and world meet, both literally and figuratively), because we too\nhave experienced the way the earth both informs and exceeds the world\nof meanings we take from it, enduring the same struggle to world the\nearth (albeit on a smaller scale) in our own hermeneutic and\nphenomenological engagement with Van Gogh\u2019s painting (and\nHeidegger\u2019s\n texts, which seek to \u201cpreserve,\u201d that is, creatively disclose, the inexhaustible world of meanings at work in the work, thereby helping to hold open this ontologically-pluralistic and so nascently postmodern world).[99]\n\n\nThe most important point to grasp here, then, is that Heidegger does\nnot maintain (as it is easy but nonetheless a mistake to assume) that\nVan Gogh\u2019s painting allows us somehow first to directly intuit\nthe world of a farmer as she might experience it so that, by getting in\ntouch with her farming world, we can thereby come to experience the\n\u201cessential tension\u201d between earth and world with which a\nfarmer is intimately familiar. That cannot be right because it\nbegs the question, assuming the aporetic step that Heidegger realizes\nneeds to be explained (as we saw in 3.3), namely, how can we move from\nan aesthetic experience of a painting on hand like an object to an\nencounter with the \u201cequipmentality\u201d of equipment? It\nis crucial to see that Heidegger does not first assume that the shoes\nin the painting belong to a farmer, and then, by alluding to the\nfarmer\u2019s world, introduce the essential struggle between earth\nand world as the truth of the painting. If that were the sequence of\nsteps in Heidegger\u2019s argument, then not only would he be\nknowingly begging his own question but, worse, Schapiro\u2019s telling\ncriticism that the shoes in Van Gogh\u2019s painting could not in fact\nhave been used by a farmer would constitute a completely devastating\nobjection to Heidegger\u2019s interpretation. For, Schapiro\nis certainly right that the shoes in the painting could not have been\nused by a woman while farming, for the simple reason that the\nDutch farmers Van Gogh painted wore wooden clogs in the damp potato\nfields, not leather shoes like those worn by farmers in Southern\nGermany, which would have quickly rotted from the damp soil in\nthe\n Netherlands.[100]\nThus, if Heidegger had sought simply\nto move from what he assumed were a pair of farmer\u2019s\nshoes to an intimation of the earth/world struggle familiar to farmers,\nand then from there to the essence of art, Schapiro\u2019s objection\nwould destroy the bridge Heidegger was seeking to build from an ontic\nwork of art to the ontological truth of art in general.\n\n\nThis longstanding controversy can finally be resolved, however, once\nwe realize that Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological interpretation of\nVan Gogh actually follows a different sequence of steps. As we\nhave seen, Heidegger moves from: (1) experiencing an objective\npainting of unused shoes (in the standard aesthetic way); to (2)\nnoticing and attending to the dynamic \u201cnothing\u201d in the\nbackground of the painting and thereby (3) encountering the earth/world\nstruggle implicit in the work; to finally (4) intimating, from this\nearth/world struggle, what a farmer\u2019s inconspicuous use of shoes\nas equipment is like. The trick Schapiro misses (along with most\nother readers of Heidegger\u2019s famous essay) is that attending to\nthe \u201cnothing\u201d that makes itself visible in the background\nof Van Gogh\u2019s painting allows us to encounter the essential\ntension between world and earth for ourselves, and it is this\nencounter\u2014with the tension between that which comes forth into\nthe light (\u201cworld\u201d) and that which nurtures this coming\nforth and yet also shelters itself in the darkness\n(\u201cearth\u201d)\u2014that allows us to understand, as though\nfrom the inside, what it is like to walk in the shoes of a\nfarmer.\n\n\nIn the end, then, Schapiro\u2019s objection that the shoes belonged not to\na farmer but to Van Gogh himself does indeed miss Heidegger\u2019s\nphilosophical point. Once we understand the actual sequence of steps\nin Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological argument, we can see that Schapiro\u2019s\ncriticism really only temporarily complicates the inference from step\n3 to step 4 (that is, the move from encountering the conflict between\nearth and world to understanding what it is like to walk in a farmer\u2019s\nshoes).  This is an inference, however, that Heidegger could have\nreached just as easily by discussing the world of Van Gogh himself\n(whom Schapiro takes to be rightful owner of the shoes in the\npainting). In Heidegger\u2019s view of him, Van Gogh clearly understood the\nearth/world struggle at least as lucidly as the farmers he painted (so\nHeidegger could just as easily have moved from encountering the\nearth/world struggle to understanding what it is like to walk in the\nshoes of a painter like Van Gogh). Indeed, Heidegger\u2019s final point\n(the point conveyed by his references to \u201cyou\u201d and\n\u201cyou yourself\u201d) is that Van Gogh and these farmers lived\nthe same struggle in different ways, and so do all of us meaning\nfarmers, that is, all of us who genuinely create by discerning\ninchoate contours and struggling to give shape to something that\npreviously was only partly glimpsed at best and so remained hidden\nin darkness.  Art thus teaches us not to try to banish the darkness\nthat surrounds the light of intelligibility, but to learn to see into\nthat ubiquitous \u201cnoth-ing\u201d so as to discern therein the\nenigmatic \u201cearth\u201d which nurtures all the genuine meanings\nthat have yet to see the light of day. Insofar as we can learn from\nVan Gogh (or other similarly great artists) to see in this poetic way\nourselves, Heidegger suggests, we will find ourselves dwelling in a\npostmodern world permeated by genuinely meaningful possibilities.\n",
