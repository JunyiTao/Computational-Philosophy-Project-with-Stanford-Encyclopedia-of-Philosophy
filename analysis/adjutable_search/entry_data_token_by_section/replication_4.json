However, as the preceding discussion indicates,\nhis later revisions to his general theoretical outlook were influenced\nstrongly by the traditional perspective of genes and organisms. Genes\ncontain the information necessary to produce organisms and their\nadaptations. Genes \u201cride around\u201d in and\n\u201cguide\u201d organisms. As Dawkins describes them, vehicles are\nrelatively discrete entities that \u201chouse\u201d replicators and\nthat can be regarded as machines programmed to preserve and propagate\nthe replicators that ride inside them. Although these terms may be\nappropriate for the relations between genes and organisms, they\ninterfere with a more general analysis of replication and selection.\nWhat really matters in selection is that entities at various levels of\norganization interact with their environments in such a way that the\nrelevant replicators increase in relative frequency. The actual causal\nchain that connects replicators and vehicles need not be limited to\ndevelopment.\n\nFor example, Dawkins argues at some length that genes and only genes\ncan function as replicators in biological evolution. He adds that\n\u201call adaptations are for the preservation of DNA; DNA itself\njust is\u201d (Dawkins 1982a: 45). But, DNA itself exhibits\nadaptations. Anyone who has spent much time examining the molecular\nstructure of DNA soon realizes that it is adapted to replicate. In\naddition, the proliferation of junk DNA, transposons, and meiotic\ndrive are three examples in which the only phenotypes that matter are\nphenotypic characteristics of genes (Brandon 1996; Sterelny 1996:\n388). Dawkins\u2019 characterizations of replicators, vehicles, and\nthe relations between the two are too closely tied to genes,\norganisms, and development. DNA can certainly replicate itself, but it\ncan also function as a \u201cvehicle\u201d, even though it cannot\ncode for, ride around in, or direct itself. In sum, a more general\ncharacterization of selection is needed, a characterization that does\nnot assume that the only causal connection between replicators and\nvehicles is development from embryo to maturity. Such a generalization\nwas offered by Hull (1980, 1981, 1988), who proposed that the relevant\nnotion is \u201cinteractor\u201d rather than \u201cvehicle\u201d,\nas interactors are causal and active while vehicles are passive\nentities.\n",
