    "main_text": "Clarifying FA Theories: Some Choice Points || FA Theory, Primitivism, and Subjectivism\n1.2 FA Theory, Primitivism, and Subjectivism\n\nThe explanatory element of FA theories also distinguishes these\ntheories from \u201cprimitivism\u201d about their explananda.\nWhereas an FA theory of an evaluative property seeks to explain facts\ninvolving that property by appeal to normative facts about human\nresponses, primitivism about the property holds that facts involving\nit are explanatorily basic or fundamental. A paradigmatic proponent of\nprimitivism is G.E. Moore (1903), who held this view about the\nproperty of being (intrinsically) good, or valuable\nsimpliciter. For Moore, something that\u2019s good\nsimpliciter just is good; its goodness can\u2019t be\nexplained in other terms, and so, a fortiori, can\u2019t be\nexplained in the way FA theorists propose. Notably, Moorean\nprimitivism about good is in principle compatible with FA theories of\nvarious other evaluative properties. For example, one might favor an\nFA theory of being pitiful, but reject such a theory of being\ngood (or vice versa). And more generally, FA theorists might be\nselective, for various reasons, about the evaluative properties they\nseek to explain. Possible reasons for such selectivity are discussed\nin section 3.\n\nFA theories of evaluative properties can also be distinguished from\n\u201csubjectivist\u201d theories of those properties, which seek to\nexplain evaluative properties entirely in terms of human responses\nthat meet certain non-normative criteria (e.g., Lewis 1989). For\nexample, a subjectivist might hold that whenever someone is admirable,\nthat\u2019s because that person would be admired by anyone who knew\nall the facts, reflected adequately on them, etc. FA theories, in\ncontrast, hold that what makes someone admirable is that admiring them\nmeets some normative condition. What this condition is,\nprecisely, is a matter of intramural debate (see section 1.3). If the\ncondition in question can ultimately be explained in naturalistic\nterms, then FA theories may also turn out to be subjectivist theories\n(McHugh and Way 2022a). For example, if an FA theorist explains facts\nabout what\u2019s good in terms of facts about what\u2019s rational\nto value, but then explains the latter normative facts in naturalistic\nterms, then their FA theory is subjectivist (Smith 1994). However, FA\ntheories needn\u2019t be subjectivist: instead, they might\ndeny that the normative facts in terms of which they explain certain\nevaluative facts can themselves be explained in naturalistic\nterms.\n",
