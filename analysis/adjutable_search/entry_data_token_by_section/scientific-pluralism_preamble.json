    "main_text": "\n\nScience is a complex epistemic and social practice that is organized\nin a large number of disciplines, employs a dazzling variety of\nmethods, relies on heterogeneous conceptual and ontological resources,\nand pursues diverse goals of equally diverse research communities.\nPhilosophers of science have often aimed to find order in this\ncomplexity through methods of unification and reduction. Pluralism, as\nan explicit program in philosophy of science, emerged from an\nincreasing frustration with the limitations of unifying frameworks in\nthe light of the disunified reality of scientific practice. As\nphilosophers of science increasingly highlighted in the 1970s and\n1980s, scientific theories often do not reduce (Fodor 1974), there is\nnot one universal scientific method (Feyerabend 1975), not only one\nfundamental scientific ontology (Dupr\u00e9 1981), and successful\nscience requires not only epistemic but also social diversity (Harding\n1988). While scientific pluralism has often been framed in opposition\nto the unity of science and \u201cthe ancient notion of philosophy as\nunified knowledge\u201d (Cat 2012), pluralist philosophy of science\nhas become a broad platform for negotiating post-positivist philosophy\nof science in the light of epistemic and social diversity. The\nliterature on scientific pluralism has therefore increasingly moved\nfrom a simple contrast between monism and pluralism to debates about\ndifferent ways of articulating pluralism (Ruphy 2016). This article\nexplores this \u201cplurality of pluralisms\u201d (Wylie 2015)\nthrough four main areas of the debate about scientific pluralism:\n\u201cTheories, Models, and Explanations\u201d, \u201cPractices and\nMethods\u201d, \u201cOntologies, Classifications and\nConcepts\u201d, \u201cThe Social Organization of Science\u201d.\n",
