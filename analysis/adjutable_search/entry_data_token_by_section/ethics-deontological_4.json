    "main_text": "Deontological Theories || Contractualist Deontological Theories\n2.3 Contractualist Deontological Theories\n\nSomewhat orthogonal to the distinction between agent-centered versus\npatient-centered deontological theories are contractualist\ndeontological theories. Morally wrong acts are, on such accounts,\nthose acts that would be forbidden by principles that people in a\nsuitably described social contract would accept (e.g., Rawls 1971;\nGauthier 1986), or that would be forbidden only by principles that\nsuch people could not \u201creasonably reject\u201d (e.g., Scanlon\n2003).\n\nIn deontology, as elsewhere in ethics, is not entirely clear whether a\ncontractualist account is really normative as opposed to metaethical.\nIf such account is a first order normative account, it is probably\nbest construed as a patient-centered deontology; for the central\nobligation would be to do onto others only that to which they have\nconsented. But so construed, modern contractualist accounts would\nshare the problems that have long bedeviled historical social contract\ntheories: how plausible is it that the \u201cmoral magic\u201d of\nconsent is the first principle of morality? And how much of what is\ncommonly regarded as permissible to do to people can (in any realistic\nsense of the word) be said to be actually consented to by them,\nexpressly or even implicitly?\n\nIn fact modern contractualisms look meta-ethical, and not normative.\nThomas Scanlon\u2019s contractualism, for example, which posits at its core\nthose norms of action that we can justify to each other, is best\nconstrued as an ontological and epistemological account of moral\nnotions. The same may be said of David Gauthier\u2019s contractualism. Yet\nso construed, metaethical contractualism as a method for deriving\nmoral norms does not necessarily lead to deontology as a first order\nethics. John Harsanyi, for example, argues that parties to the social\ncontract would choose utilitarianism over the principles John Rawls\nargues would be chosen (Harsanyi 1973). Nor is it clear that\nmeta-ethical contractualism, when it does generate a deontological\nethic, favors either an agent centered or a patient centered version\nof such an ethic.\n",
