    "main_text": "The Book on Ciphers\n5. The Book on Ciphers\n\nWhen seen in the context of the doctrine of physiognomics, it comes as\nno surprise that Porta authored a book on ciphers, as he believed\nhimself endowed with a special ingenuity for decoding all forms of\ntexts. Renaissance cryptographers in general had a penchant for\nmystery and the preternatural, as evident from Johannes\nTrithemius\u2019s Steganography, for example. Trithemius,\nthe Abbot of Sponheim, got in trouble with his ecclesiastical censors\nbecause he used a complex numerological series of demons\u2019 names,\narranged on Lullian wheels, for encryption (Arnold 1991). With their\naura of mystery, ciphers thus qualified as a congenial topic for\nPorta\u2019s general outlook as a popularizer of secrets and as\ninventor of marvels. De furtivis litterarum notis is apparently the\nfirst text on this topic that not only explained various ways to\nencrypt messages, but also gave detailed instructions on how to\ndecipher coded messages (Strasser 2008). The art of cryptography had\nthe advantage of being perhaps less wicked than necromancy, while\nstill attracting the attention of powerful political patrons. For\nsomeone aspiring to be the adviser and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of one of\nthe more powerful worldly rulers, it was therefore not an unwise\nchoice to write such a book.\n",
