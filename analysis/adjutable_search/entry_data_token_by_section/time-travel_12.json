    "main_text": "Time and Change || Time Travel and Change\n4.2 Time Travel and Change\nLeibniz\u2019s Law says that if x = y (i.e. x\nand y are identical\u2014one and the same entity)\nthen x and y have exactly the same properties. There is\na superficial conflict between this principle of logic and the fact\nthat things change. If Bill is at one time thin and at another time\nnot so\u2014and yet it is the very same person both times\u2014it\nlooks as though the very same entity (Bill) both possesses and fails\nto possess the property of being thin. Three-dimensionalists and\nfour-dimensionalists respond to this problem in different\nways. According to the four-dimensionalist, what is thin is not Bill\n(who is a four-dimensional entity) but certain temporal parts of Bill;\nand what is not thin are other temporal parts of Bill. So\nthere is no single entity that both possesses and fails to possess the\nproperty of being thin. Three-dimensionalists have several\noptions. One is to deny that there are such properties as\n\u2018thin\u2019 (simpliciter): there are only temporally\nrelativised properties such as \u2018thin at time t\u2019. In\nthat case, while Bill at t1 and Bill\nat t2 are the very same entity\u2014Bill is wholly\npresent at each time\u2014there is no single property that this one\nentity both possesses and fails to possess: Bill possesses the\nproperty \u2018thin at t1\u2019 and lacks the\nproperty \u2018thin at\n t2\u2019.[30]\n\n\nNow consider the case of a time traveller Ben who encounters his\nyounger self at time t. Suppose that the younger self is thin\nand the older self not so. The four-dimensionalist can accommodate\nthis scenario easily. Just as before, what we have are two different\nthree-dimensional parts of the same four-dimensional entity, one of\nwhich possesses the property \u2018thin\u2019 and the other of which\ndoes not. The three-dimensionalist, however, faces a problem. Even if\nwe relativise properties to times, we still get the contradiction that\nBen possesses the property \u2018thin at t\u2019 and also\nlacks that very same \nproperty.[31]\n There are several possible options for\nthe three-dimensionalist here. One is to relativise properties not to\nexternal times but to personal times (Horwich, 1975, 434\u20135);\nanother is to relativise properties to spatial locations as well as to\ntimes (or simply to spacetime points). Sider (2001, 101\u20136)\ncriticises both options (and others besides), concluding that time\ntravel is incompatible with three-dimensionalism. Markosian (2004)\nresponds to Sider\u2019s \nargument;[32]\n Miller (2006) also responds to Sider and\nargues for the compatibility of time travel and endurantism; Gilmore\n(2007) seeks to weaken the case against endurantism by constructing\nanalogous arguments against perdurantism. Simon (2005) finds problems\nwith Sider\u2019s arguments, but presents different arguments for the\nsame conclusion; Effingham and Robson (2007) and Benovsky (2011) also\noffer new arguments for this \nconclusion.[33]\n",
