The evidence from bodies that the sexes have different natures\n\nAlthough the souls of men and women are identical with respect to the\nrational faculty, Marinella claims that women have better souls than\nmen because (i) they have better desires which in turn (ii) affect the\ncapacity for reason, effectively rendering women better able to access\nand act on their reason, so that (iii) women behave better\u2014and\nin particular, they behave with more moderation. She also argues that\nthe female body offers evidence of the superiority of women\u2019s\nsouls, both as a cause and as an effect, despite the equality of\nrational capacity enjoyed by men and women.\n\nShe adopts the common distinction between body and soul: \n\n\nWomen, like men, consist of two parts. One, the origin and cause of\nall noble deeds, is referred to by everyone as the soul. The other is\nthe transitory and mortal body. (1601b, 55) \n\n\nThe soul, on her view, commands the body (or ought to); at the same\ntime, it is dependent on the body for its operations (55). That is,\nthe operations of the soul\u2014including desires, thoughts,\ndecisions, and actions\u2014require the body. Because the soul relies\non the body for its operations, the body manifests or expresses the\ncharacter of the soul and its faculties, in a variety of ways.\n\nWhen feminist philosophers first considered the question of sexual\ndifference in the Renaissance, they were writing in response to\novertly misogynistic claims (in Marinella\u2019s case, the claims of\nPassi), which centred on the physical, moral and intellectual failings\nof women. One question feminists then had to face was whether to\nconcede the facts, and dispute the explanation, or to dispute the\nfacts. The question was whether it was better (i) to concede that\nwomen might appear to be inferior to men in a variety of ways (to be,\nfor example, more foolish or more focused on frivolous pursuits) but\nto dispute that nature made them such or (ii) to dispute that women\nwere more foolish, morally weak, or physically incapable in fact.\nMarinella by and large adopts the second strategy, arguing that women\nin fact display in their behavior not ignorance, unreason, vanity or\nflightiness, but on the contrary all the moral excellences that their\ndetractors accuse them of lacking. At the same time, she does believe\nthat men have suppressed the abilities and limited the opportunities\nof women, particularly with respect to intellectual endeavours, and\nthat is a reason to expect that women might not be able to speak for\nthemselves\u2014their souls cannot express themselves directly\n(Marinella 1601b, 80; Malpezzi Price and Ristaino 2008, 116). The\nsuppression of women\u2019s abilities, and the concrete suppression\nof their speech, justifies in Marinella\u2019s view moving to\nconsider the evidence of women\u2019s bodies in order to understand\ntheir souls, and to argue for the superiority of women on that basis.\nBecause the soul of a person operates through the body, the body\nmanifests certain characteristics of the soul, and so stands to offer\nevidence of the character of the soul.\n\nMarinella intends then to demonstrate the superiority of women\u2019s\nsouls through the superiority of their bodies. She appeals to two\nphysical indications of the greater nobility of women\u2019s souls:\n(i) the moderate temperature of the female body, and (ii) their bodily\nbeauty. Consider her claim that \u201cthe greater nobility and\nworthiness of a woman\u2019s body is shown by its delicacy, its\ncomplexion, and its temperate nature, as well as by its beauty,\u201d\n(1601b, 57). She believes the delicacy and complexion peculiar to\nwomen\u2019s bodies are caused by the more moderate temperature of\nthe body, so\u2014despite this list\u2014there are only two\nfundamental differences in the bodies of men and women, temperature\nand beauty. \n",
