In population genetic theory, the\nrole of the environment in adaptive evolution tends to be hidden in\nthe recursion equations for gene frequency dynamics, where the common\nassumption of a constant selection coefficient implies a constant\nrelationship between genotype, phenotype and fitness irrespective of\nenvironment. For ecological genetics, in contrast, the\ncentral focus is the causal relationship between genetic variation and\nenvironmental variation, where conspicuous (especially discrete)\nphenotypic variation is assumed to have an underlying genetic\ncomponent. The advent of molecular tools and the development of\nmolecular ecology within ecological genetics has greatly broadened the\nconceptual scope of the field within the last fifteen years.\n\nThe origins of ecological genetics are founded in the\n\u201cmodern synthesis\u201d (Huxley 1942), where the integration of\ngenetics and Darwinian evolution was achieved through the theoretical\nworks of R. A. Fisher, S. Wright, and J. B. S. Haldane and the\nconceptual works and influential writings of J. Huxley, T. Dobzhansky,\nand H. J. Muller. From these genetic beginnings, it was natural for\nmuch evolutionary research to be concentrated on the forces that cause\nchanges in gene and genotype frequencies within populations. In this\ngenetics-centered view, the four evolutionary forces (mutation, random\ngenetic drift, natural selection, and gene flow) act within and among\npopulations to cause micro-evolutionary change. Those same forces act\nin concert to convert the genetic variation within populations into\nmore or less permanent genetic variation between species. Given enough\ntime, the micro-evolutionary forces are believed to be sufficient to\naccount for macro-evolutionary patterns characteristic of the higher\ntaxonomic groups. In short, the central challenge of the field of\nevolutionary genetics has been to describe how the four\nevolutionary forces shape patterns of gene, genome and species\ndiversity, with a particular emphasis on the predominant role of\nnatural selection among the several evolutionary forces.\n\nHowever, the gene-centered viewpoint was not the primary research\nfocus or challenge for a large subset of field researchers, consisting\nof naturalists, zoologists and ecologists. Their focus was similarly\non natural selection as the only evolutionary force which can produce\nadaptation, the fit between an organism and its environment. However,\nits focus is on the role of environment in adaptation. Ecological\ngenetics is the study of evolutionary processes, especially\nadaptation by natural selection, in an ecological context in order to\naccount for phenotypic patterns observed in nature. Where evolutionary\ngenetics tends toward a branch of applied mathematics founded on\nMendelian axioms, ecological genetics is grounded in the\nreciprocal interaction between theory and empirical observations from\nfield and laboratory.\n", "toc": [{"#Intr": "1.

Introduction\n\nIn this entry, I review briefly the history of ecological genetic\nresearch and its recent integration with molecular genetic methods in\nthe sub-field of molecular ecology. Most studies in ecological\ngenetics begin with one or the other of the two most prominent\npatterns in nature: \n\nadaptation, the \u201cfit\u201d between an organism and its\nenvironment (see the entry on\n fitness);\n or, \npolymorphism, the maintenance of two or more phenotypic or genetic\nforms within a single population by natural selection. \n\n\nWith the development of molecular ecology, the latter can be\nsignificantly extended to explore phenotypic differences between\nspecies in a phylogenetic context. This permits a more incisive\ninvestigation of the environments that favor adaptive divergence of\nphenotypes between species. Moreover, the same molecular methods\nuseful in phylogenetics can often be modified to identify the genes or\nchromosomal regions responsible for those inter-specific phenotypes\n(Gibson et al. 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nThe earliest studies attempted to document the action of natural\nselection in wild populations in support of Darwinian\u2019s theory.\nIn so doing, these studies attempted to demonstrate that evolution by\nnatural selection was not only an historical causal force, but that it\nalso continued to act on the characteristics of wild populations in\nthe present day. Under the assumption of gradualism, it was not clear\nwhether natural selecting acting on phenotypes in wild populations\ncould be detected, let alone account for between species phenotypic\ndifferences. The starting observations of many of the earliest\necological genetic investigations, i.e., the phenotypes of most\ninterest, were conspicuous phenotypic polymorphisms, such as the\nspotting patterns on butterfly wings or banding patterns of snail\nshells or polymorphisms of chromosomal rearrangements. These were\neither known to have a genetic basis or could safely be assumed to\nhave one.\n\nAlthough natural selection is the only evolutionary force that can\naccount for adaptation, several evolutionary forces, acting alone or\nin combination, can sustain a genetic polymorphism, at least\ntransiently. Thus, assigning causal agency to a single evolutionary\nforce is often a more difficult problem when explaining polymorphism\nwithin species than it is for adaptations. In these studies of\nconspicuous polymorphisms, natural selection was\n\u201cprivileged\u201d among the four evolutionary forces as an\nexplanation for their maintenance, at least in part, because one of\nthe founders of ecological genetics, E. B. Ford, collaborated\nextensively with R. A. Fisher (see Ford 1975). In the early period\n(1928\u20131950), much of the problem of assigning causal agency to\nthe maintenance of genetic polymorphism was resolved by definition\nrather than by empirical observation (see section 2 below:\n Classical Ecological Genetics and Polymorphism).\n That is, only those polymorphisms where the rarest form was deemed\n\u201ctoo common\u201d to be accounted for by recurrent mutation\nwere considered suitable for study. Moreover, if the species was\nabundant, then random genetic drift could similarly be eliminated as a\nrelevant process. Indeed, the longest standing controversies in\necological genetics centered on whether natural selection could\naccount for the observed frequencies of polymorphism or whether the\nvariation in those frequencies indicated a significant role of random\ngenetic drift (see, for example, Schemske and Bierzychudek [2001]\nregarding the interpretation of flower color polymorphism in the\ndesert annual, Linanthus parryae).\n\nIn the later period (1966\u2013present), the advent of allozymes and\nmolecular genetics permitted investigation of a less biased sample of\ngenetic polymorphism. The modern characterization and analyses of\nallozymes and single nucleotide polymorphisms still retains the early\nemphasis on natural selection as the single most important\nevolutionary force shaping the hereditary material. Differently put,\nadaptive explanations for patterns of species divergence tend to be\nfavored over non-adaptive explanations (see recent review of the\ncauses of the rapid diversification among species of reproductive\ngenes by Dapper and Wade [2020].)\n\nEcological genetics began at a time when the major theoretical aspects\nof the Modern Synthesis were in place, when the marvels of adaptation\nwere clear, but when few empirical examples of natural selection in\naction were available. Achieving adaptive perfection by gradualism\nrequires long periods of time wherein \n\n\n\u2026 a very slight selective effect acting for a correspondingly\nlong time will be equivalent to a much greater effect acting for a\nproportionately shorter time. (R. A. Fisher 1921, in correspondence\nwith S. Wright, quoted by Provine [1986: 247]) \n\n\nVery weak natural selection, however, is an impediment to the goal of\necological genetics to illuminate natural selection in action in the\nwild. Thus, the shift in focus toward understanding the role of strong\nnatural selection in maintaining visible genetic polymorphisms is\nunderstandable. As put by its founder, E. B. Ford, \n\n\nIt [ecological genetics] supplies the means, and the only direct\nmeans, of investigating the actual process of evolution taking place\nin the present time. (1975: 3)\n\n\nThe focus of traditional ecological genetic research on the current\naction of natural selection has been broadened in several ways over\nthe last two decades. First, whereas the early studies tended to focus\non evolution in single populations, there is now a significant\nemphasis in ecological genetics on the population genetic structure of\nmetapopulations and the roles of migration, extinction, and\ncolonization on evolutionary and adaptive processes (e.g., Goodacre\n2002). Secondly, whereas the earliest studies emphasized conspicuous\npolymorphisms or chromosomal rearrangements and their influence on\nfitness, the advent of biochemical genetics in the late 1960s\nsignificantly broadened the phenotype, beginning with the application\nof electrophoretic methods to population studies. These studies\nrevealed abundant \u201chidden polymorphism\u201d in the new,\nbiochemical phenotype of enzyme mobility. These methods extended the\ndomain of ecological genetics from the classic \u201cconspicuous\nphenotypic polymorphisms\u201d in color, shape and behavior to the\nphysiological domain of enzyme function. The new emphasis on\nfunctional biochemical phenotypes, however, did not change the\nexplanatory or causal framework of the field. Determining the role of\nnatural selection in maintaining enzyme polymorphisms, such as the\nfast/slow polymorphisms of alcohol dehydrogenase (an enzyme involved\nin the detoxification of environmental alcohols), superoxide dismutase\n(which catalyzes the removal of free oxygen radicals), or the\nesterases (which are involved in the detoxification of pesticides in\nmany insects), became a primary focus of investigation with the goal\nof finding a selective basis for the enzyme variants in terms\nof differences in their physical and kinetic properties. Indeed, the\nroots of controversy between the selectionist and neutralist schools\nover the maintenance of \u201cbalanced\u201d polymorphisms (see\nLewontin 1974) lie in the controversy over random genetic drift versus\nnatural selection in early ecological genetic research (see\nbelow).\n\nThe more recent advent of DNA sequencing initiated the growth of\nmolecular phylogenetics and molecular ecology. The new technology\nadded not only a new phenotype, but also a more pronounced historical\n(phylogenetic) dimension to ecological genetic research. Molecular\nphylogenics and comparative sequence analysis have become the primary\nmodern tools for the investigation of the evolutionary patterns and\nprocesses that shape DNA sequences. These methods have strengthened\ninferences regarding biogeography, speciation, and adaptation,\nespecially in regard to the diversification of taxonomic lineages that\nattends ecological release and adaptive radiations. They have shifted\nthe focus from polymorphism within species to diversification among\nclades (e.g., Kostyun et al. 2019) and permitted the investigation of\nthe history of individual genes (Gibson et al. 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n For example, ecological genomic data have permitted the\nreconstruction of the invasion of the Galapagos Islands by the wild\ntomato species, Solanum pimpinellifolium, through\nhybridization and introgression with a closely related endemic\nspecies, Solanum cheesmaniae. Moreover, an adaptive\nphenotype, orange fruit color similar to the endemic species, is\nassociated with two introgressed regions of the Solanum\ngenome which contain known fruit color loci, supporting the inference\nthat adaptive convergence was genetically facilitated by introgression\n(Gibson et al. 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n\nTwo new patterns in particular have been recognized by these DNA-based\nmethods. The first is the preponderance of \u201cpurifying\nselection\u201d, wherein the conservative power of natural selection\nis seen as a barrier to diversity. It is this conservative aspect of\nnatural selection acting at the molecular level that lends power to\nthe investigation of the genetic architecture of model organisms\nvis \u00e0 vis human genetics. The second pattern is the\ndiscovery of the existence of ancient polymorphisms,\nmolecular genetic variation whose age may be greater than that of the\nspecies or taxon in which it occurs. Natural selection remains the\nprivileged explanatory force in modern sequence studies. Indeed, the\nsearch for, characterization, and explanation of uniquely molecular\npatterns, such as codon bias (Behura & Severson 2013) and\nselective sweeps, has, if anything, elevated the focal explanatory\npower of natural selection in evolutionary studies. That is, nonrandom\nor biased use of redundant codons in DNA sequences is seen as evidence\nthat, although they have no effect on amino acid sequence, redundant\ncodons are not all functionally equivalent in that some permit more\nefficient gene expression. This is taken as evidence that natural\nselection is all powerful, reaching down into the genome to affect\neven the smallest and least significant components of the hereditary\nmaterial.\n\nIn this entry, I review classical ecological genetics and then discuss\nthe novel kinds of processes and explanations that accompanied the\nexpansion of the field from single populations to genetically\nstructured metapopulations and from phenotypic to biochemical and DNA\nsequence polymorphisms. I will show that the central early controversy\nover the roles of random genetic drift and natural selection in\nevolution has continued to this day, despite the apparent\ntechnological refinements afforded by the availability of biochemical\nand DNA sequence data. That is, finer scale or more reductionistic\ngenetic data has not yet led to a resolution of the original\nconceptual issues that lie at the foundation of ecological\ngenetics.\n2. Classical Ecological Genetics and Polymorphism\n\nHistorically, the starting point of ecological genetic research has\nbeen the discovery of variation within a natural population, i.e., a\nphenotypic polymorphism. The subsequent goal is three-fold: \n\n determination of whether or not the polymorphism has a genetic\ncomponent; \n determination of the frequency of each of the polymorphic types\nand their spatial and temporal variability; and, \ndetermination of how natural selection maintains the polymorphism,\neither alone or in combination with other evolutionary forces. \n\n\nFord defines genetic polymorphism as \n\n\n\u2026the occurrence together in the same locality of two or more\ndiscontinuous forms of a species in such proportions that the rarest\nof them cannot be maintained merely by recurrent mutation. (1975: 109;\nand see also Ford 1940) \n\n\nAlthough recurrent mutation can maintain a polymorphism indefinitely\nat mutation-selection balance, here Ford is clearly interested in a\nmore active role for natural selection in the maintenance of\npolymorphism. The first task was facilitated by early developments in\npopulation genetic theory, particularly the findings of Fisher (1930).\nFord interpreted these to mean that naturally occurring, discontinuous\nphenotypic variation is \u201cnearly always genetic\u201d. The\nreasoning stems from the theoretical findings that, in large\npopulations, it is unlikely that the positive and negative fitness\neffects of an allele (or chromosomal inversion) will be exactly\nbalanced. As a result, the number of individuals with a rare neutral\nmutation is proportional to the number of generations since its\norigin. Furthermore, if truly neutral, such alleles would spread so\nslowly through a large population by random genetic drift that the\n\n\n\ndelicate equipoise required for their neutrality will have been upset\nby changes in the environment and in the genetic outfit of the\norganism (Ford 1975: 110) \n\n\nbefore a neutral allele reached appreciable frequency. In addition,\nrecurrent mutation as a cause of persistent polymorphism was\nconsidered most unlikely and, in fact, this evolutionary cause is\nexplicitly excluded from the definition of genetic polymorphism by\nFord (see above). Hence, neutral genetic polymorphism was considered\nan exceptionally rare event by the founders of ecological genetics\nand, consequently, such polymorphisms were the hallmark of strong,\nactive natural selection.\n\nFord (1940) further distinguished two types of selective polymorphism,\ntransient polymorphism and balanced polymorphism. Transient\npolymorphism, caused by a new favorable mutation in the process\nof displacing its ancestral allele by natural selection, was\nconsidered unlikely, because \u201c\u2026advantageous genes will\nusually have been already incorporated into the genetic constitution\nof the species\u201d (Ford 1975: 110). This and statements like it\nreflect the viewpoint that organisms in nature are exquisitely adapted\nto their environments by the long-acting process of Fisherian\ngradualistic natural selection (see the entry on\n natural selection).\n It is a prelude to the more explicitly adaptationist views found in\nthe current behavioral literature (see review in Shuster & Wade\n2003). This view of the evolutionary process as primarily one of\nrefinement of existing organismal adaptation is an essential part of\nthe Fisherian theory of evolutionary genetics (Wade & Goodnight\n1998).\n\nThe presumptions of a genetic basis for discontinuous phenotypic\npolymorphism and its maintenance by natural selection are clear from\nthe writings of Ford cited above but these principles also can be\nfound together in a single statement: \n\n\nIn view of these considerations it is clear that if any unifactorial\ncharacter is at all widespread it must be of some [adaptive] value.\nIndeed, it is probably true that even if it occurs at as low a\nfrequency as 1 per cent, it must have been favored by selection. (Ford\n1975: 110) \n\n\nThus, the primary goal of the ecological geneticist is to discern\nexactly how natural selection is acting to maintain a balanced\npolymorphism by the relative strength of opposing fitness effects\nacting on the different sexes, at different stages in the life\nhistory, at different localities or at different times in the lifetime\nof the organism.\n\nThe existence of males and females was discussed by Ford as a prime\nexample of a balanced polymorphism because, \n\n\nIt is obvious that any tendency for the males to increase at the\nexpense of the females, or the reverse, would be opposed by selection.\n(Ford 1975: 111) \n\n\nFisher (1930) first argued that, because every individual has a mother\nand a father, the mean fitness of males must be equal to the mean\nfitness of females multiplied by the sex ratio, expressed as the\nnumber of females to males (i.e., the mean number of mates per male;\nsee also Shuster and Wade 2003, Chapter 1). As a result, fitness\nincreases with rarity, and, in this circumstance, whenever the\npopulation sex ratio deviates from unity, a gene that increases the\nnumbers of the minority sex at birth will have a selective advantage.\nThus, a sex ratio of unity is a stable, balanced polymorphism,\nachieved in many species by chromosomal determination of sex, which\nFord referred to as a \u201c\u2018built-in\u2019 genetic\nswitch-mechanism\u201d, characteristic of other genetic\npolymorphisms, like Batesian mimicry. In general, the fitnesses of two\ndifferent types constituting a phenotypic polymorphism must be equal\nto be maintained within a population by natural selection at a\nintermediate equilibrium frequency (a point recognized in Darwin 1871,\nVol. II, Chapter 14). However, the balance of selective forces for\nnon-sex related (or even sex-linked) polymorphisms is very different\nfrom that required to maintain an equal sex ratio. Using the existence\nof the separate sexes as an example of a balanced polymorphism is\nmisleading or, at least unrepresentative, of the selective forces\nnecessary to sustain balanced polymorphisms in general.\n3. Classical Ecological Genetics, Population Size, and Natural Selection\n\nThe founding ecological geneticists dismissed any significant role for\nrandom genetic drift in evolution (see the entry on\n genetic drift).\n The theoretical interaction of random genetic drift and natural\nselection for single genes with constant effects can be seen in\n Figure 1.  Fisher in his evolutionary theory\n assumed that natural populations achieved or sustained very large\n sizes as seen in his correspondence with S. Wright (letter from\n R. A. Fisher to S. Wright, August 13, 1929, as quoted in Provine\n 1986: 255) where he stated that \u201cI believe N must\n usually be the total population on the planet, enumerated at sexual\n maturity\u201d. Similarly, according to his intellectual biographer\n W. Ewens: \n\n\nFisher never paid much attention to the concept [effective population\nsize] as he should have \u2026 and used extremely high population\nsizes (up to \\(10^{12})\\) in his analyses, surely far too large in\ngeneral. (2000: 33) \n\n\nFor such extremely large population sizes, the threshold between\nselection and drift (see\n Fig. 1),\n which is determined by the effective population size, \\(N_e\\), is too\nlower to matter evolutionarily. That is, the strength of random\ngenetic drift, which is proportional to (1/\\(2N_e)\\), is very, very\nweak and even genes with very small values of \\(s\\) have their\nevolutionary fate determined entirely by selection. This is the\nessence of \u201cFisherian gradualism\u201d\u2014very\nsmall selective forces given sufficient time can have effects on\nadaptation similar to those of genes with much larger effects acting\nover a shorter time period. With very large \\(N_e\\), the domain of\nrandom genetic drift is greatly restricted even as that of natural\nselection is expanded (see\n Fig. 1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The interaction of Random\nGenetic Drift and Natural Selection. The strength of selection is\nmeasured by the selective effect, \\(s\\), of a single gene and the\nstrength of random genetic drift is indicated by \\((1/2N_e)\\), where\nthe population has effective size, \\(N_e\\). When \\(s\\) exceeds\n\\((1/2N_e)\\), then the evolutionary fate of a gene is determined\nprimarily by Natural Selection. When \\(s\\) is less than \\((1/2N_e)\\),\nthen the evolutionary fate of a gene is determined primarily by Random\nGenetic Drift. Thus, the evolutionary domains of natural selection\n(upper) and random genetic drift (lower) are separated by the wavy\nboundary determined by the effective population size. [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nHowever, ecological geneticists did not entirely dismiss\nrandom genetic drift as a significant evolutionary force for the same\nreasons that Fisher did. Field observations conducted with the\nmark-recapture methods developed by ecological geneticists documented\ngeneration-to-generation fluctuations in population size up to or\nexceeding an order of magnitude in most natural populations studied\nlong term. Thus, small local population sizes were not seen as unusual\nby ecological geneticists. Indeed, Ford believed that \n\n\n\u2026 organisms automatically generate their own cycles of\nabundance and rarity and that the changes in selection pressure with\nwhich these are associated many greatly increase the speed of\nevolution; (Ford 1975: 36) \n\n\nDespite the not infrequent occurrence of small population sizes where\ndrift would be expected to be most efficacious, random genetic drift\nwas still considered an irrelevant evolutionary force in ecological\ngenetics because natural selection was viewed as being particularly\nstrong during periods of population decline. That is, the strength of\nnatural selection was negatively correlated with population density.\nThus, as population size and \\(N_e\\) declined owing to environmental\nstress, natural selection gained in strength so that the boundary\nbetween domains\n (Fig. 1)\n always favored selection. The smallest populations showed little\nphenotypic variation, which was seen as evidence that they were the\nmost fit or most finely adapted populations. Thus, the lack of\nphenotypic variation in small populations was owing to it having been\neliminated by natural selection during the immediately prior period of\ndecline. Conversely, under periods of population increase,\nenvironmental stresses were minimal, so that natural selection was\nweaker and more permissive of variation. This concept of relaxed\nselection provided Ford with a cause for the increase in observations\nof rare phenotypic variants in large and growing natural populations.\nIf selection pressure increases inversely to population size, then the\nrole of random genetic drift in evolution must be greatly\nrestricted.\n\nIn addition, Ford (1975: 38) believed that ecological genetic research\nhad clearly demonstrated that the selective advantage of a gene in\nnature \u201c\u2026 quite commonly exceeds 25 per cent and is\nfrequently far more\u2026\u201d. Referring to\n Figure 1,\n this means that the range for values of \\(s\\) in natural populations\nlies significantly above 0.01, placing genes, even in very small\npopulations, firmly in the domain governed by natural selection.\n\nFurthermore, Ford considered that not only the strength but also the\nnature of selective pressures must frequently change with density\nbecause \n\n\n\u2026 an organism has not the same adaptive requirements when\nabundant as when rare, or when the plant and animal forms which\nimpinge on it are so. (Ford 1975: 39) \n\n\nIndeed, he thought that the fluctuating selection pressure caused by\nvariations in abundance \u201cinvalidates\u201d Wright\u2019s\nShifting Balance Theory of Evolution, which he referred to as\n\u201cfar-fetched\u201d. Interestingly, Ford and his colleagues\nbelieved that genetic subdivision of the sort postulated by Wright\nwould promote rapid evolution but for reasons very different from\nWright\u2019s and by different genetic mechanisms (natural selection\ninstead of random genetic drift, local selection, and interdemic\nselection). Ford (1975: 40\u201344) argued that subdivision of a\nlarge, geographically extensive population into relatively small\ngroups promotes rapid evolution because, \n\n\n\u2026 when populations occupy a series of restricted habitats they\ncan adapt themselves independently to the local environment in each of\nthem, while when spread over a larger area they can be adjusted [by\nnatural selection] only to the average of the diverse conditions which\nobtain there. This, however, requires that the adaptations should not\nbe constantly broken down by a trickle of immigrants from one small\ncolony to another. \n\n\nHere, he proposes a trade-off between specialized adaptation to local\nconditions in the absence of migration and generalized adaptation to\nglobal conditions in the presence of migration. In modern terms, this\nis called genotype-by-environment interaction, where the selective\neffect, \\(s\\), of a gene changes with change in the environment. A\ngene might be adaptive in one environmental context (i.e., \\(s \\gt\n0)\\) but maladaptive in another (i.e., \\(s \\lt 0)\\). Migration between\nlocal environments mixes the adaptive and maladaptive responses to\nselection and reduces the average magnitude of gene frequency change.\nIn this sense, genotype-by-environment interaction for fitness is\nviewed as an evolutionary constraint because it limits the rate of\ngene frequency change. The restraint can be removed simply by stopping\ngene flow and the mixing of genes across different local environments.\nThus, the fixed selective effect illustrated in\n Figure 1,\n must be considered an average of variable selective effects\nacross environments. Clearly, large local effects of opposite sign\nmust be averaged when there is gene flow among habitats and the\naveraging tends to reduce the magnitude of a gene\u2019s selective\neffect. Ford also suggests that the genetic mechanism involves\n\u201cgene complex[es] balanced to fit their own local\nenvironment\u201d. That is, he claimed interactions among genes, or\nepistasis, contributes to local adaptation. Thus, Ford invokes\ngenotype-by-environment interactions for fitness as well as gene-gene\ninteractions for fitness in his cases of rapid evolution, although\nboth reduce the average selective effect of a gene. This\nargument also runs counter to his assertion that the adaptive\nadvantage of a gene is typically 25 percent in natural populations.\nBoth kinds of interaction change the depiction of the threshold\nseparating natural selection from random genetic drift\n (Fig. 1);\n in fact they tend to raise it and thereby increase the domain of\nrandom genetic drift. Before turning to interaction effects, I will\nexamine a representative discussion of ecological genetics of random\ngenetic drift using data from a natural population.\n4. The Sewall Wright Effect\n\nSeveral wing coloration variants segregating in a small natural\npopulation of the moth, Panaxia dominula (Fisher & Ford\n1947), were investigated using mark-recapture in one of the longest\ncontinuous studies of a single population in all of evolutionary\nresearch. The goal of Fisher and Ford was to determine whether\nyear-to-year fluctuations in the frequency of the variants\n(medionigra, a heterozygote, and bimaculata, a\nhomozygote) were better explained by natural selection or by random\ngenetic drift. (Banding patterns in the snail, Cepea\nnermoralis\u00b8were the topic of similar discussions of the\nrelative roles of natural selection and genetic drift [Cain &\nShephard 1954; Cain & Provine 1992; Millstein 2008, 2009].) They\ninferred from their analysis\n\n\nThe conclusion that natural populations in general, like that to which\nthis study is devoted, are affected by selective action, varying from\ntime to time in direction and intensity and of sufficient magnitude to\ncause fluctuating variations in all gene frequencies is in good\naccordance with other studies of observable frequencies in wild\npopulations. \u2026 We do not think, however, that it has been\nsufficiently emphasized that this fact is fatal to the theory which\nascribes particular evolutionary importance to such fluctuations in\ngene ratios as may occur by chance in very small isolated populations.\n\u2026\n\nThus our analysis, the first in which the relative parts played by\nrandom survival and selection in a wild population can be tested, does\nnot support the view that chance fluctuations can be of any\nsignificance in evolution. (Fisher & Ford 1947: 171, 172; quoted\nin Provine 1986: 423)\n\n\nWith this paper, Fisher and Ford moved the long-standing debate\nbetween Wright and Fisher over the relative roles of natural selection\nand random genetic drift in evolution from theory to nature. It is\nremarkable that, in the first such study with only eight years of\nobservations on a single locus with alternative alleles, they are\nconfident in rejecting Wright\u2019s theory and random genetic drift\nin its entirety.\n\nIn his response to their analyses, Wright (1948) pointed out, first,\nthat his theory of evolution explicitly involved the simultaneous\naction of several forces (selection, drift, mutation, and migration)\nand he emphatically rejected the paradigm of Fisher and Ford that\neither selection or drift alone had to be responsible for all\nof the observed fluctuation in gene frequencies (see the entry on\n population genetics).\n Wright noted that, in order to reach their statistical conclusion,\nFord and Fisher had to include gene frequency data from a decade\nbefore the more careful study, notably a period without any estimates\nof population size. Without this earlier data point, the average\nfluctuations were much smaller and not significant. He pointed out\nthat, like the mark-recapture estimates of population numbers, the\ngene frequencies themselves were estimates whose variation, based on\nthe reported sample sizes, accounted for more than half (55.2%) of the\nobserved variance that Fisher and Ford were trying to explain. He then\nshowed that, if one assumed only the unitary explanation of natural\nselection, then the observed gene frequency fluctuations were so large\neven without the sampling variance that the temporal\nvariations in the allelic selection coefficients must range from near\nlethality (or sterility) to tremendous advantage (i.e., from\n\u22120.50 to +0.50). However, Fisher and Ford (1947) provided no\nindication of comparable levels of temporal variation in any\nenvironmental factor acting as a selective agent. Wright argued that\nthe effective population sizes used in the analysis were almost\ncertainly too large, possibly by an order of magnitude, and that\nFisher and Ford had made no attempt to estimate the factors expected\nto reduce effective size, like temporal variation in breeding numbers,\nnon-random mortality among larvae (mortality clustered within families\nas might affect a species which experiences > 85% pupal mortality\nowing to viral infection), or other causes of the variance in\noffspring numbers (such as variation among females in egg numbers or\nvariation among males in mate numbers). In an unyielding reply, Fisher\nand Ford (1950) labeled chance or random fluctuations in gene\nfrequency, the Sewall Wright Effect, a term which has endured\nto the present day as a synonym for random genetic drift.\n\nWith a larger data set covering several more years, Ford (1975: 146)\nrevisited this exchange and argued that Wright remained wrong on each\ncount. Ford also showed that the selective advantage for the rarer of\nthe genes varied widely, from \u22120.10 to +0.20, and that there was\nno evidence of heterozygote advantage. He did not find, however, the\nexpected negative correlation between strength of selection and\npopulation size in these data. In the intervening decades, data from a\nvariety of other organisms and natural population had become available\nand its review led Ford to conclude: \n\n\nAs a result, it is no longer possible to attribute to random genetic\ndrift or to mutation any significant part in the control of evolution.\n(1975: 389) \n\n\nThus, throughout its founding period, ecological genetics was\nrelentlessly supportive of natural selection as unitary explanation\nfor evolutionary change. (Later laboratory research has shown that the\nexpression of the color patterns is sensitive or plastic to the\nthermal environment during development and thus the gene frequency\nestimates may be subject to significant measurement error, owing to\nthe misclassification of genotypes. This is yet another source of\nvariation, not accounted for in the Ford analyses. It tends to weaken\nthe link between genotype and phenotype and thereby weaken the\nrelationship between selection acting on phenotypes and the underlying\ngenotypes. In addition, empirical evidence has found, as Wright\nexpected, that temporal fluctuations in population size, large\nvariance among females in fecundity, and sexual selection reduce the\neffective number to less than half the Fisher-Ford estimate. In\naddition, more careful studies have reduced Ford\u2019s estimates of\nthe magnitude of the average genic selection coefficient by about two\nthirds [see Cook & Jones 1996].)\n5. Interactions and their Effect on the Threshold between Natural Selection and Random Drift\n\nThe existence of either genotype-by-environment interaction \\((\\rG\n\\times \\rE)\\) or gene-by-gene interaction (epistasis or \\(\\rG \\times\n\\rG\\)) greatly complicates the estimation of selection coefficients.\nEcological geneticists like Ford postulated interactions of the sort\nthat could change the sign of genic selection coefficients with\nchanges in the environment (including density) or in the genetic\nbackground. This kind of reversal of selective effect requires what is\nknown as a \u201ccrossing-type\u201d norm of reaction for \\(\\rG\n\\times \\rE\\) or additive-by-additive epistasis for \\(\\rG \\times \\rG\\)\n(Wade 2002). The simplest model of crossing-type \\(\\rG \\times \\rE\\),\nconsists of additive selection (i.e., genotypic fitnesses of \\(1 + 2s,\n1 + s\\), and 1 for genotypes AA, Aa, and aa, in one environment and\nthe opposite order in the second environment) in each of two\nalternative environments, \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\), with frequencies,\n\\(f_{E_1}\\) and \\(f_{E_2}\\), respectively. As the two environments\nfluctuate in frequency, spatially or temporally, the selective effect\nof an A allele changes in both magnitude and sign (see\n Fig. 2).\n Depending upon the relative frequencies of the alternative\nenvironments and the amount of gene flow or migration between them,\nthe A allele on average can be a \u201cgood\u201d gene or a\n\u201cbad\u201d gene with respect to fitness, a gene of major effect\nor minor effect on fitness, or even a neutral gene if the two\nenvironments are equally abundant. The smaller the amount of migration\nbetween the environments, the greater is the degree of local\nadaptation to each as theory and\n Ford suggested (see above).\n However, the average selective effect of the gene in the\nsense of Fisher\u2019s theory must be smaller than the average\nobservation in a particular locality at a particular time because the\nlong-term average contains both positive and negative values of \\(s\\).\nFurthermore, to the extent that the local value of \\(s\\) changes sign\nowing to continuous fluctuations in local environmental conditions,\nthe average effect on fitness A allele will also move downwards, from\nthe domain of selection to the domain of drift as Wright suggested.\nThus, the very kind of population subdivision imagined by Ford, with\nselection acting in every locality albeit in different directions,\ncreates, rather than eliminates, an increased opportunity for random\ngenetic drift. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The interaction of Random\nGenetic Drift and Natural Selection, when there is either\ngenotype-by-environment interaction or additive-by-additive epistasis\n(see text). The selective effect, \\(s\\), of a single gene changes\nmagnitude as the frequency of the alternative environments,\n\\(f_{E_1}\\) and \\(f_{E_2}\\), connected by gene flow, changes\nor as the frequency of alternative alleles, \\(p_B\\) and\n\\(p_b\\), change at an interacting locus. Thus, neither the selective\neffect of a gene nor the effective population size remains constant.\nAs a result, relative to\n Figure 1,\n the threshold boundary between the domains of Natural Selection and\nRandom Genetic Drift is greatly widened, meaning that both forces play\nmore or less equal evolutionary roles over a broad range of values of\n\\(s\\) and \\(N_e\\). Furthermore, interactions of this sort open the\npossibility that changes in the relative frequencies of alternative\nenvironments or alternative alleles at other loci can move a\ngene\u2019s selective effect from the domain of selection that of\ndrift or vice versa during the course of its evolution. [An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\nA very similar effect on the \u201cgene\u201ds eye view\u2019 of\nselection is caused by additive-by-additive epistasis (Goodnight &\nWade 2000; Wade 2001, 2002). The simplest model of this kind of \\(\\rG\n\\times \\rG\\), with interaction between loci A and B, each with\nalternative alleles, results in an average genic selection coefficient\nacting on the A allele of \\(s(p_B - p_b)\\), where \\(p_B\\) and \\(p_b\\)\nare the frequencies of alternative alleles at the B-locus that\ninteract in the additive-by-additive model with alleles at the A\nlocus. The relative frequencies of the alternative alleles at the B\nlocus, determine whether the A allele is a \u201cgood\u201d gene or\na \u201cbad\u201d gene with respect to fitness, a gene of major\neffect or minor fitness effect, or even a neutral gene when the\nbackground alleles are equally abundant (i.e., \\(p_B = p_b)\\).\nWhenever allele frequencies of its epistatic partner change, either by\ndrift or selection, the A allele\u2019s selective effect also changes\nand, like the case of \\(\\rG \\times \\rE\\), it moves the boundary\nbetween the domains of natural selection and random drift\n (Fig. 2),\n increasing the domain of the latter at the expense of the former.\n6. Allozyme Variation and the Drift vs Selection Controversy\n\nThe central problem with using conspicuous polymorphisms for\ninvestigating the relative roles of the variety of different\nevolutionary forces is that they not an unbiased sample of genetic\ndiversity with respect to either adaptive function or amount of\ngenetic variation. Indeed, the definition of genetic polymorphism\nadopted by Ford (see above) incorporates the essence of both of these\nbiases. For a period, it was believed that \u201cThe solution to our\ndilemma lies in the development of molecular genetics\u201d (Lewontin\n1974: 99). With the advent of electrophoresis, the amino acid sequence\nof a random sample of proteins from almost any organism could be\nstudied and, for the first time, the level of genetic diversity, in\nthe form of amino acid substitutions, across the genome could be\nquantified.\n\nTwo measures of genetic diversity were possible using electrophoresis:\n\n\n the number of loci polymorphic; and, \n the average heterozygosity per locus per individual. \n\n\nFrom studies across a number of species, it was estimated that\n15\u201340% of all loci were polymorphic and the average individual\nwas heterozygous at 5\u201315% of its genome. Since this technique\nmeasured primarily amino acid substitutions resulting in charge\nchanges, i.e., only one third of all possible amino acid\nsubstitutions, one could infer that these were minimal levels of\ngenetic diversity which significantly underestimated the actual\nlevels. The conclusion that genetic variation was ubiquitous, with\nmost genes being polymorphic, was inescapable. The search for the\nadaptive function of allozyme variants and balancing selection at the\nphysiological level ensued, just as it had in the earliest studies in\necological genetics.\n\nHowever, the observed levels of genetic polymorphism presented an\ninsurmountable problem for the mathematical theory of evolutionary\ngenetics. The amount of genetic variation was much too large to be\nexplained by the type of balancing selection observed by Ford and his\ncolleagues for conspicuous phenotypic polymorphisms in natural\npopulations. The basic problem was that the numbers of selective\ndeaths necessary to account for the observed levels of allozyme\npolymorphism exceeded the reproductive excess of almost all species.\nThis where the focus on genetics must be coupled with the ecology of\nreproduction and viability. Haldane (1957) called this the \u201ccost\nof natural selection\u201d and it is also referred to as the\nsubstitutional load. Differently put, the mortality of homozygous\ngenotypes, if independently selected, (also known as the\n\u201csegregation load\u201d) would exceed the total numbers of\noffspring produced by a population. For this reason, Kimura (1983)\nproposed his neutral theory of molecular evolution, founded on the\ntheoretical observation that the probability of fixation of a novel\nmutant allele with selective coefficient, \\(s \\gt 0\\), was\napproximately \\(2s\\) (Wright 1931: 133). Since \\(s\\) was generally\nbelieved to be in the range of 0.001 to 0.0001, the likelihood of loss\nof a new favorable mutation by chance is quite high, only slightly\nsmaller than the probability of loss by chance for a truly neutral\nallele.\n\nStudies of protein structure revealed that the functional,\nnon-synonymous sites of a protein, which constitute the minority of\nits amino acids, evolved several times more slowly than the\nnon-functional, synonymous or structural sites. Kimura\u2019s view\nthat much, if not most, of evolutionary change at the molecular level\nwas determined by random genetic drift and not natural selection was\nhighly controversial. As Kimura noted, \n\n\n\u2026if a certain doctrine is constantly being spoken of favorably\nby the majority, endorsed by top authorities in their books and taught\nin classes, then a belief is gradually built up in one\u2019s mind,\neventually becoming the guiding principle and the basis of value\njudgment. At any rate, this was the time when the panselectionist or\n\u201cneo-Darwinian\u201d position was most secure in the history of\nbiology: the heyday of the traditional \u201csynthetic theory\u201d\nof evolution. (1983: 22)\n\n\nIt was soon recognized that a more reductionistic approach (DNA\nsequence studies) might help to resolve the issue of whether or not\nevery amino acid was of some functional value because the redundant\npositions in the code of life were assumed to provide an estimate of\nthe true \u201cneutral\u201d rate of evolution, owing to random\ngenetic drift acting in the absence of selection.\n7. Sequence Variation and the Drift vs Selection Controversy\n\nThe neutral theory of evolution is the antithesis of ecological\ngenetics. It states that random genetic drift, independent of the\nenvironment, rather than natural selection, governs most evolutionary\nchange at the level of the DNA and proteins. At the same time, it\nadmits that natural selection predominates in shaping the\nmorphological and physiological traits that manifest an adaptive fit\nwith the environment. This is a paradox because most of the DNA\nappears to be non-functional while most of the externally observable\nphenotype appears to have adaptive function.\n\nTests of the theory using DNA sequence data consist of comparisons of\nthe relative evolutionary rates of different kinds of sites (base\npairs) within codons and take advantage of the redundancy in the\ngenetic code. The rate of neutral evolution is estimated from levels\nof polymorphism or numbers of segregating sites within species or the\ndivergence between species in silent or redundant site substitutions\n(e.g., Dapper & Wade 2020). Silent sites are those that do not\nresult in an amino acid change in the protein and, hence, are\nnon-functional in the usual sense. In contrast, the rate of selective\nchange or selective constraint is evaluated relative to the neutral\nrate using replacement sites, those base pair changes that result in\namino acid changes. If the rate of substitution or polymorphism is\nlower than neutral, it is evidence of selective constraint or\npurifying natural selection acting to prevent change and preserve\nfunction in the face of mutational damage. If the rate of substitution\nis higher than neutral, then it is evidence of adaptive substitution.\n\n\nMolecular evolutionary studies also revealed the existence of\npseudogenes, non-coding stretches of DNA derived by the\ntandem duplication and subsequent inactivation by mutation of single\ncopy genes. The lack of function of the pseudogene makes all of its\ncodons effectively neutral and provides another estimate of the rate\nof neutral evolution. Importantly, \u201creplacement\u201d sites\nthat evolve slowly in the functional gene have been shown to evolve\nmore rapidly in the nonfunctional tandem duplicate pseudogene.\n\nChanges in the pattern of neutral variation in the vicinity of a\nselected site(s) are also informative because, during an adaptive\nsubstitution, neutral variants linked to the piece of selected DNA are\ncarried or \u201cswept\u201d to fixation along with it. This\n\u201cselective sweep\u201d temporarily reduces the level of neutral\nvariation in the vicinity of selected sites until it can be replaced\nby mutation. The degree of reduction in neutral variation or the\n\u201cfootprint of selection\u201d depends upon the strength of\nselection, the frequency of recombination during selection, and the\ntime since the initiation of selection. The footprint is most\nconspicuous when a selective sweep is initiated by the advent of a\nsingle, novel favorable mutation. To the extent that novel selection\nresults from a change of environment and begins to act on existing or\nstanding variation already in the population, the impact on neutral\npolymorphisms may be quite minimal.\n\nBalancing selection of the sort observed by Ford leaves its own unique\n\u201creverse\u201d footprint on neutral diversity (Kreitman &\nDi Rienzo 2004) . Because the segments of DNA constituting the\nbalanced polymorphism are held in the population by selection much\nlonger than expected based on random drift, these segments have a\nhigher effective population size (owing to lower variation in\noffspring numbers than random). As a result, they have a longer time\nto accumulate mutational variation at nearby neutral sites. In some\ncases, the time is longer than that required to create new species,\nresulting in trans-specific polymorphisms (Cho et al. 2006).\nThus, levels of neutral diversity are expected to be enhanced in the\nvicinity of a molecular balanced polymorphism. When the mating system\nrestricts recombination (e.g., selfing or inbreeding species), the\nregion of elevated neutral diversity in the vicinity of a balanced\npolymorphism can be extensive (e.g., Arabiodopsis thaliana\n[Tian et al. 2002]).\n\nKimura predicted that silent substitutions would evolve more rapidly\nthan replacement substitutions before sequence data were\navailable to test his neutral theory of molecular evolution. Molecular\ngenetic studies have confirmed his prediction: silent sites evolve\nseveral times faster than replacement sites. These studies clearly\nshow that the primary mode of action of natural selection at the level\nof the DNA sequence is purifying selection. It is this highly\nconservative aspect of natural selection that permits comparative\nmolecular evolutionary studies of developmental processes across\nspecies as diverse as humans and flies. At the molecular level, most\ngenes, though polymorphic in sequence, do not display evidence of\nbalancing selection and instead manifest patterns of variation that\naccord well with neutral theory.\n\nThe interaction of selection and random drift across linked regions of\nDNA sequence is one of the most active current areas of theoretical\nand empirical research in molecular evolution. Theory shows that it\ncan be difficult to separate cleanly the action of the evolutionary\nforces of selection and drift except for certain regions of parameter\nspace, whose generality remains unknown and subject to much debate.\nLike the study by Fisher and Ford (1947), most empirical studies\ninterpret all deviations away from strictly the neutral\nexpectation as evidence of natural selection without addressing the\nissue of agency. For example, codon bias is evidence that natural\nselection affects even the apparently non-functional components of\ngenes. Thus, the original ecological genetic view that natural\nselection is the only significant evolutionary force characterizes\nmuch of modern molecular evolution, despite progress in theory and the\navailability of much more reductionistic genetic methods. The\nparallels between the summary statement of Ford\n (1975: 389; see above)\n and that of the molecular evolutionary geneticist, E. Nevo,\ntwenty-five years later are remarkable: \n\n\nBiodiversity evolution, even in small isolated populations, is\nprimarily driven by natural selection, including diversifying,\nbalancing, cyclical, and purifying selective regimes, interacting\nwith, but ultimately overriding, the effects of mutation, migration,\nand stochasticity [random genetic drift].
