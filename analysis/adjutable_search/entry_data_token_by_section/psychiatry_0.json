    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nScholars and textbooks alike agree (though they might not like it)\nthat psychiatry now adheres to the \u201cmedical model\u201d, which\nadvocates \u201cthe consistent application, in psychiatry, of modern\nmedical thinking and methods\u201d (Black 2005, 3) because\npsychopathology \u201crepresents the manifestations of disturbed\nfunction within a part of the body\u201d (Guze 1992, 44) to wit, the\nbrain. But what does it mean to adopt this view of psychiatry, and what\ndifference does it make?\n\n\nOne might think that the medical model merely commits us to a\nbrain-based view of mental illness with few implications for science,\nand it is true that clinical or scientific differences across\npractitioners seldom seem to have much to do with divergent\ninterpretations of the medical model. However, many theorists have\nargued that our current diagnostic categories, as compiled into DSM-5\n(American Psychiatric Association 2013: I refer to different editions\nof this work by its abbreviated title), are faulty because they are\nderived from observable phenomena rather than underlying physical\npathologies. These theorists are sceptical about many existing\npsychiatric diagnoses, and not just on empirical grounds; they see DSM\ndiagnoses as collections of symptoms rather seeing them as medicine\nunderstands diseases\u2014in terms of destructive processes realized\nin bodily tissues. Genuine mental illnesses, on this view, are not\njust sets of co-occurring symptoms but destructive processes taking\nplace in biological systems. Following Murphy (2009), this may be\ntermed the strong interpretation of the medical model. In contrast, a\nminimal interpretation of the medical model thinks of mental disorders\nas collections of symptoms that occur together and unfold in\ncharacteristic ways, but it makes no commitments about the underlying\ncauses of mental illness.\n\n\nThese two interpretations are set out in section 2. Explanation is\ndiscussed in section 3. The strong interpretation naturally suggests\nthat psychiatry should embrace the practices of medical\nexplanation. If disease is a pathological process in bodily systems,\nthen there must be a way of understanding how such processes occur in\nthe brain, and how they explain the clinically observable facts about\nmental illness. But it seems that the logic of the medical model does\nnot force us to privilege any one level of explanation\u2014notably,\nit does not commit us to explanations restricted to the resources of\nmolecular biology. Psychiatry, then, is a multi-level science. But we\noften know very little about the mental illnesses that psychiatrists\nstudy, and much explanation in psychiatry involves case studies or\nnarrative accounts that cite the characteristics of a disorder, rather\nthan underlying systems. Theorists disagree over whether these should\nbe seen as different kinds of explanation, or as rudimentary forms of\na full causal explanation. Section 3 also discusses the difficulties\nraised by cross-cultural issues. Section 4 discusses some recent approaches to mental illness that are broadly within the medical model but dissent from the mainstream.\n",
