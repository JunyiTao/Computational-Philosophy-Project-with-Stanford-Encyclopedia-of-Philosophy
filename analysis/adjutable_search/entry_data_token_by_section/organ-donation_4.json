This reply raises the difficult problem,\ndiscussed below, of how far consent justifies harm. Another reply is\nto say that taking organs from willing living donors may not be\nall-things-considered harmful to them (Spital 2004). This reply\nusually draws on one of the following normative views: (a) that living\ndonation is only permissible when we expect the donor not to be\nharmed; or (b) that it is only permissible when we expect the donor to\nbenefit (in both cases, all things considered, taking account of a\nwider range of factors than just physical wellbeing) (Williams\n2018).\n\nSuppose a person were prevented from donating an organ. On the one\nhand, the person would avoid the risks of physical harm. But, on the\nother, the person may suffer what are, in the medical literature,\ncalled \u201cpsychosocial harms\u201d. These could include\nloneliness from losing a relative, having to act as caregiver to a\nperson with organ failure, and survivor guilt. In philosophical terms,\na person may also suffer vicarious harm. People whose welfare is\nintertwined with others suffer a loss when the other person does\n(Feinberg 1984; Raz 1986). Quite possibly, then, a person who donates\nmay not suffer harm all-things-considered, that is, when all the\ndifferent instances of harm are weighed up.\n\nThe \u201cdo no harm\u201d argument against living donation is not\nwidely accepted\u2014that is why living donation proceeds apace.\nNonetheless, even if the physical harm can be outweighed by the need\nto avoid other harms, or by consent, or both, one may think that as a\nmatter of policy living donation should be discouraged. One fear is\nthat increasing the use of living donors relieves the pressure to find\nways to get more organs from other sources, notably the deceased.\n",
