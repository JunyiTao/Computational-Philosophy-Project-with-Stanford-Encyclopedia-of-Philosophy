    "main_text": "Can intentionality be naturalized?\n10. Is intentionality exhibited by all mental phenomena?\n\nPerceptions, beliefs, desires and intentions and many other\n\u201cpropositional attitudes\u201d are mental states with\nintentionality. They are about or represent objects and states of\naffairs under a particular psychological mode or format. Perceptions,\nbeliefs, desires and intentions illustrate a basic duality of the\nintentionality of the mental: the duality between mind-to-world and\nworld-to-mind directions of fit. In order to clarify this duality,\nElizabeth Anscombe (1957, 56) considers a mere \u201cshopping\nlist\u201d. The list may either be used as a set of instructions (or\na blueprint) for action by a customer in a store or it can be used as\nan inventory by a detective whose purpose is to draw a record of what\nthe customer is buying. In the former case, the list is not to be\nrevised in the light of what lies in the customer\u2019s grocery bag.\nBut in the latter case, it is. If a mismatch should occur between the\ncontent of the grocery bag and the list used by the customer, then the\nblame should be put on the customer, not on the list. In the case of a\nmismatch between the content of the bag and the list drawn by the\ndetective, the detective should correct his list.\n\nBuilding on Anscombe\u2019s insight, Searle (1983) argues that there\nare two opposite \u201cdirections of fit\u201d that either speech\nacts or mental states can exemplify: just as the speech act of\nassertion has a word-to-world direction of fit, beliefs and\nperceptions have a mind-to-world direction of fit. It is the function\nof an assertion to state a fact or an actual state of affairs.\nSimilarly, it is the function of a belief and a perception to match a\nfact. Unlike assertions, orders have a world-to-word direction of fit.\nUnlike beliefs and perceptions, desires and intentions have a\nworld-to-mind direction of fit. It is the function of an order to\nrepresent a non-actual possible or impossible state of affairs.\nSimilarly, it is the function of a desire and an intention to\nrepresent a non-actual possible or impossible state of affairs.\n\nNow the following questions arise: are Brentano and the\nphenomenological tradition right? Do all mental states exhibit\nintentionality? Is intentionality a feature of every aspect of human\nexperience? Are all forms of consciousness consciousness of\nsomething? Does every mental state possess one or the other direction\nof fit? Do sensations (e.g., pains), feelings, emotions (e.g.,\ndepression) all exhibit intentionality? These questions are very\ncontroversial in contemporary philosophy of mind. Before examining\nvarious contradictory answers to these questions, a preliminary\nquestion is relevant. Whether Brentano was right or not, why should we\nwant a mark or a criterion of the mental at all?\n\nThe question of why we should seek a criterion of the mental at all\nhas been made pressing by some recent remarks of the linguist Noam\nChomsky (2000, 75, 106), according to whom methodological naturalism\nmandates that we use terms like \u2018mind\u2019 and\n\u2018mental\u2019 on a par with terms like \u2018chemical\u2019,\n\u2018optical\u2019 or \u2018electrical.\u2019 Since we do not\nseek to determine the true criterion of the electrical or the mark of\nthe chemical, by naturalistic parity of reasoning, Chomsky argues, we\nshould no more seek a criterion of the mental. Whether we need\ncriteria respectively for the chemical and for the optical, it is a\ngenuine issue whether the English word \u2018mental\u2019 can\njustifiably apply to things as diverse as e.g., a pain and the belief\nthat 5 is a prime number. As Richard Rorty (1979, 22) has put it,\n\u201cthe attempt to hitch pains and beliefs together seems ad\nhoc\u2014they don\u2019t seem to have anything in common except our\nrefusal to call them \u2018physical\u2019\u201d. His conclusion is\nthat the word \u2018mental\u2019 expresses no single property, let\nalone a \u2018natural kind.\u2019 On Rorty\u2019s irrealist view,\nthe word \u2018mental\u2019 is just part of an academic\nlanguage-game with no scientific explanatory import.\n\nThus, Rorty\u2019s radical irrealist picture of the mind relies on\nthe observation that pains and arithmetical beliefs seem to have\nnothing in common. Not many contemporary philosophers of mind would\naccept Rorty\u2019s irrealist picture of the mind. But most do\nrecognize that if minds are real, then two problems arise:\nthe problem of intentionality and the problem of consciousness or\nconscious phenomenal experience. Most would claim that a solution to\nthe problem of intentionality is not ipso facto a solution to\nthe problem of consciousness. Why is that so?\n\nHuman beings can experience the world in various ways by means of\nseveral distinct sensory modalities (vision, audition, touch,\nolfaction). They are also aware of parts of their bodies as when they\nsuffer pains. The problem of consciousness is often called \u201cthe\nproblem of qualia\u201d because states with a strong\nphenomenal character\u2014like pains, visual or olfactory\nsensations\u2014are states that introspectively seem endowed with a\nstrong intrinsic subjective quality. The general problem of\nconsciousness is to explain, in Thomas Nagel\u2019s (1974) famous\nphrase, \u201cwhat it is like\u201d to be a certain creature with a\nphenomenal experience. What is the phenomenal character\u2014the\nphenomenology\u2014of the various forms of human experience? Few if\nany philosophers\u2014physicalist or otherwise\u2014are inclined to\nassume that, unlike intentionality, phenomenal consciousness can be\nexemplified by non-mental things. Not many would deny that, although\npains, visual sensations, olfactory sensations, auditive sensations\nare very different experiences, nonetheless they all exhibit a common\nproperty called \u201cphenomenal consciousness\u201d. From both a\nscientific and a physicalist perspective, the questions arise whether\nphenomenal consciousness is physical and whether it can be explained\nin physical terms, i.e., as a result of processes happening in the\nbrain.\n\nAs many philosophers are willing to recognize, the concept expressed\nby the word \u2018consciousness\u2019 is much in need of\nclarification. Three such clarifications are worth mentioning. Two of\nthem consist in a pair of distinctions drawn by David Rosenthal\n(1986). One distinction is between creature consciousness and state\nconsciousness. The other distinction is between transitive and\nintransitive consciousness. A creature can be said to be\n\u2018intransitively\u2019 conscious if she is alive and normally\nresponsive to ongoing stimuli. She stops being intransitively\nconscious while in a dreamless sleep, if she is knocked out, drugged\nor comatose. A creature can be said to be \u2018transitively\u2019\nconscious if she is conscious of things, properties and\nrelations in her environment. Whereas a creature can be both\nintransitively conscious and transitively conscious of something, a\nmental state can only be intransitively conscious. One important\naspect of the problem of consciousness is the problem of how to draw\nthe line between conscious and unconscious mental states. A third\nclarification has been Ned Block\u2019s (1995) distinction between\naccess consciousness (or A-consciousness) and phenomenal consciousness\n(or P-consciousness). Whereas a state is said to be A-conscious if it\nis poised for free use in reasoning and for direct rational control of\naction and speech (i.e. available or accessible to several cognitive\nmechanisms), the P-consciousness of a state is what it is like to be\nin that state (whether or not it has A-consciousness). In recent work,\nBlock (2007) has argued that much evidence from the cognitive\nscientific investigation of the visual system corroborates his\ndistinction between P- and A-consciousness. For example, on his\ninterpretation, experiments on change blindness and also the\nneuropsychological investigation of brain-lesioned human patients with\nneglect show that attention and working memory are necessary parts of\nA-consciousness, but not of P-consciousness. What makes a state\nA-conscious is that its content is made available to various cognitive\nsystems (e.g., attention and memory). Furthermore, not unless a visual\nstimulus is attended and stored in working memory can an individual\nreport having seen it. But Block (2007) takes the evidence to show\nthat an individual can be P-conscious of the content of an\nunreportable stimulus, i.e. a stimulus whose content has not been\neither attended or stored in working memory. For supporting arguments,\nsee Dretske (2004, 2007). Block\u2019s interpretation of the\ncognitive scientific data has been criticized by scientific advocates\nof the so-called \u201cglobal neuronal workspace model\u201d of\nconsciousness: see e.g., Dehaene et al. (2006) and Naccache and\nDehaene (2007), which is a commentary to Block (2007). The global\nneuronal workspace model of consciousness nicely fits with\nDennett\u2019s (1991, 2005) position on intentionality and\nconsciousness (which he has himself dubbed the \u201cfame (in the\nbrain) theory of consciousness.\u201d (For further discussion of\nthese issues, see the SEP entry on\n attention.)\n\nOn the one hand, the notion of transitive creature consciousness seems\nlike a close cousin to the notion of intentionality. On the other\nhand, what makes a person\u2019s mental state A-conscious is that the\nperson may have access to it. Presumably, a person may have conscious\naccess to one of her A-conscious mental states in virtue of having\nsome other mental state (e.g., a thought or belief) directed to it. So\nhaving states with intentionality seems like a condition for any\nmental state to be A-conscious. It follows that if the problem of\nconsciousness is to be clearly distinguished from the problem of\nintentionality, the key question is that of explaining how a mental\nstate can be P-conscious.\n\nMany philosophers do not accept Brentano\u2019s third thesis that\nintentionality is the mark of all mental states. They do not reject\nBrentano\u2019s second thesis on the grounds that intentionality can\nbe exhibited by some non-mental things. They reject it because, like\nBlock (1996) and Peacocke (1983), they subscribe to a view that can be\ncalled \u2018anti-intentionalism,\u2019 according to which a\nperson\u2019s conscious mental state has a phenomenal character that\ncannot be accounted either by its own intentionality (if it has any)\nor by the intentionality of some other of his or her mental states.\nNor do they embrace Rorty\u2019s irrealist attitude towards the\nmental. Some of the philosophers, who fall under the label\n\u2018anti-intentionalism,\u2019 may accept the thesis that\nintentionality and the mental happen to coincide. But since they claim\nthat intentionality in turn derives from phenomenal consciousness,\nthey are not quite faithful to the spirit of Brentano\u2019s thesis\nthat intentionality is the constitutive feature of the mental.\n\nThe anti-intentionalists, who reject both Rorty\u2019s irrealism and\nBrentano\u2019s thesis that intentionality is the true mark of the\nmental, can be divided into two groups. Some, like Ned Block (1995,\n1996), would accept a dual view according to which mental\nstates fall into a division between intentional states and phenomenal\nstates. As we shall see momentarily, this division is denied by the\nintentionalists. In between the intentionalists and the phenomenal\nrealists, who accept the dual view, lies the intermediate view of\nphilosophers such as Colin McGinn (1989), Sydney Shoemaker (1996) and\nCharles Siewert (1998), who see an intimate connection between\nintentional and phenomenal states.\n\nOther anti-intentionalists, like John Searle (1990, 1992) and Galen\nStrawson (1994), go one step further and reject both Brentano\u2019s\nthesis and the dual view of the mind. They hold consciousness to be\nthe true criterion of the mental. Arguably, as noted above, they might\naccept the thesis that intentionality coincides with the mental, but\nthey hold the view that intentionality derives from consciousness. On\nthe one hand, Strawson (1994) clearly holds phenomenal consciousness\nto be the true criterion of the mental. On the other hand, Searle\n(1992) embraces what he calls \u201cthe Connection principle,\u201d\naccording to which unless a mental state is available to\nconsciousness, it does not qualify as genuinely mental. As a result,\nSearle (1992) seems to endorse the view that availability to\nconsciousness is the criterion of the mental. Now, the view that\navailability to consciousness is the true criterion of the mental\nentails that states and processes that are investigated by cognitive\nscience and that are unavailable to consciousness will fail to qualify\nas genuine mental states. This view has been vigorously disputed by\nChomsky (2000). On the natural assumption that beliefs are\nparadigmatic mental states, the view that phenomenal consciousness is\nthe true criterion of the mental further entails that there is\nsomething it is like to have such a propositional attitude as\nbelieving that 5 is a prime number\u2014a consequence some find\ndoubtful. If there was nothing it is like to believe that 5 is a prime\nnumber, then, according to the view that phenomenal consciousness is\nthe criterion of the mental, many propositional attitudes would fail\nto qualify as genuine mental states. However, much recent work in the\nphilosophy of mind has been recently devoted to the defense of\nso-called \"cognitive phenomenology,\" according to which there is\nsomething it is like to believe that e.g., 5 is a prime number. See\nthe SEP entry on consciousness and the papers collected in Bayne and\nMontague (eds.) (2011).\n\nMany of the philosophers who accept a version of Brentano\u2019s\nthesis that all mental states exhibit intentionality try to show that\nthe mysteries of phenomenal consciousness can either be explained away\n(i.e., dissolved) or that phenomenal consciousness derives from\nintentionality. Daniel Dennett (1988, 1991, 2001) has been the most\nconsistent advocate of the view that the distinction between\nphenomenal consciousness and access consciousness has been overrated\nand that qualia ought to be \u2018quined,\u2019 i.e.,\nresolutely denied and dispensed with.\n\nSo-called \u201cintentionalists\u201d are philosophers who think\nthat phenomenal consciousness can really be explained by\nintentionality because they think that phenomenal states are\nintentional states. On the intentionalist account, the phenomenal\nqualities of an experience are the properties that objects are\nrepresented as having in the experience. Some intentionalists, like\nFred Dretske (1995) and Michael Tye (1995), think that whereas\nthoughts and propositional attitudes are mental representations with\nconceptual content, qualia or conscious experiences are\nmental representations with nonconceptual content (about\nwhich see Dretske 1981, Peacocke 1992, 2001 and the essays in Crane\n1992). On their view, to have phenomenal features is to have a certain\nsort of nonconceptual content. On Tye\u2019s (1995) view, for\nexample, pains are mental representations of bodily parts and the\nphenomenal experience of a pain is the nonconceptual content of the\nbodily representation. Other intentionalists such as Elizabeth\nAnscombe (1965) and especially John McDowell (1994), who are skeptical\nof the distinction between conceptual and nonconceptual content, will\nappeal to other criteria, e.g., functional role, to account for\nphenomenal states (see the SEP entry on Nonconceptual mental content).\nFor example, McDowell (1994) argues that the phenomenal content of\nexperience can be explained in terms of a suitable notion of\ndemonstrative conceptual content.\n\nThere are currently two outstanding issues facing an intentionalist\napproach to phenomenal experiences. The first is whether the\nintentionalist account can be extended to the phenomenal character of\nall sensory and bodily experiences. This is at present an open\nquestion (cf. Crane, 2007). The second issue is whether the\nnonconceptual content of perceptual experiences can be objective in\nrepresenting and referring to particular objects, or whether only\nconceptual thoughts can be objective and represent or refer to\nparticular objects. On the one hand, Evans (1982), Dretske (1981,\n1995) and Peacocke (1992) assume that propositional thought or\nconceptual content is required to achieve reference to particulars. On\nthe other hand, Burge (2010) has offered powerful considerations\n(mostly derived from perceptual psychology) in favor of the\nobjectivity of purely perceptual representations. On Burge\u2019s\nview, perceptual representations are both sensory and objective\nrepresentations of the environment. Their nonconceptual content need\nnot be supplemented by intellectualized (higher-order) representations\nof what makes a representation objective in order to provide objective\nrepresentations of particulars.\n\nFinally, according to David Rosenthal\u2019s \u201chigher-order\nthought\u201d theory of consciousness, what makes a person\u2019s\nmental state conscious is that the person is conscious of it by virtue\nof having formed a higher-order thought (or HOT) about it.\nFurthermore, the phenomenal character of a person\u2019s sensory\nexperience\u2014what it is like for the person to be in that\nstate\u2014arises from the fact that the person has formed a HOT\nabout it. The problem with the HOT theory of phenomenal consciousness\nis that the theory entails that creatures who, like non-human animals\nand human babies, lack the ability to form HOTs will be deprived of\nphenomenal consciousness\u2014a consequence many will find\nimplausible (cf. Rosenthal, 1986, 2005). For further discussion, see\nthe SEP entries on\n consciousness and intentionality\n and\n higher-order theories of consciousness.\n",
