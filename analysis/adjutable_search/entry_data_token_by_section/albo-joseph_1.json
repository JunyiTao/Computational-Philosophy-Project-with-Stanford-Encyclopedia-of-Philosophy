Historical Background\n\n\nThe roots of Albo\u2019s philosophical theory are located deep within the\nground of the historical reality in which he lived and worked. The\ncentral circumstance that directly shaped his thought was the\ndistressed state of Jewish society in Christian Spain. Beginning in the\nfourteenth century, the Jews in Spain were subject to religious\npersecution on the part of the Catholic Church and Christian society in\ngeneral. Jewish thought also suffered from sharp ideological conflict\nbetween conservative thinkers and rationalists over both theological\nand social issues.\n\n\nFirst of all, in pressuring the Jews to convert, the Christian\nauthorities instituted extreme economic measures and passed\ndiscriminatory social legislation. They used coercive tactics in their\nexhortations. They also organized harsh pogroms, such as those of\n1391. These repressive measures forced many Jews to die a martyr\u2019s\ndeath. They also led to mass conversion of Jews to Christianity and to\ndeterioration on the social, economic, and spiritual planes (Baer\n1961, 95\u2013243; Netanyahu 1966, cf. index\n[\u201cConversions\u201d]; Ben-Sasson 1984, 208\u2013220,\n232\u2013238; Gutwirth 1993).\n\n\nIn addition, this period witnessed the revival of the dispute between\nfollowers of Maimonides and his opponents. On one side of this\nconflict stood the rationalists. They espoused the study of philosophy\nand attempted to integrate it into their religious-spiritual world\nwhile resolving the contradictions that emerged between philosophy and\nthe sources of revelation. On the other side stood the conservatives,\nwho rejected the study of philosophy. They adhered to the classic\nreligious sources, the Bible and the Talmud, and viewed kabbalistic\nliterature as a continuation of the chain of revelation. One of the\nfocal points of the conflict between these two theological schools\nwas the exchange of mutual accusations on the issue of responsibility\nfor the dire situation of Jewish society under Christian persecution\n(Schwartz 1991).\n\n\nModern scholars have conducted comprehensive studies of the\nrelationship between the characteristics of Jewish philosophy in Spain\nduring the fifteenth century, including Albo\u2019s thought, and the\nhistorical reality of that period (Baer 1961, 232\u2013243; Davidson\n1983, 112\u2013113; Cohen 1993; Manekin 1997).\n",
