    "main_text": "Life and Works || Medical Writer or Philosopher?\n1.1 Medical Writer or Philosopher?\n\nAlcmaeon, son of Peirithous (otherwise unknown), lived in the Greek\ncity of Croton on the instep of the boot of Italy. Diogenes Laertius,\nin his brief life of Alcmaeon (VIII. 83), asserts that he wrote mostly\non medical matters. There is, however, little direct evidence for his\nwork as a practicing physician. Later writers in the medical\ntradition, such as Galen (DK A2), treat him as a philosopher-scientist\nrather than as a physician, so that some scholars (Mansfeld 1975; cf.\nPerilli 2001 for a critique) have concluded that he was not a doctor\nat all but rather a typical Presocratic physiologos (writer\non nature). The majority of scholars, however, because of\nDiogenes\u2019 remark and because of the focus on the functioning of\nthe human body in the testimonia and fragments, refer to Alcmaeon as a\nphysician-philosopher. The historian Herodotus tells us that, in the\nsecond half of the sixth century, the physicians of Croton were the\nbest in the Greek world (III. 131) and recounts in some detail the\nactivities of the most prominent Crotoniate physician of the time,\nDemocedes (III. 125\u2013138). Thus, whether a practicing physician\nor not, Alcmaeon undoubtedly owes some of his interest in human\nphysiology and psychology to the medical tradition in Croton. In the\nfifth century, it is difficult to draw clear lines between the work of\na medical writer/physician and a philosopher/scientist. Presocratic\ncosmologies of this period devoted some attention to questions of\nhuman physiology and medicine, and conversely the early treatises in\nthe Hippocratic corpus often paid some attention to cosmology (see\nAristotle, Resp. 480b23 ff.). The earliest Presocratic\ncosmologies in Ionia (e.g., those of Anaximander and Anaximenes) did\nnot deal with physiology, and it is possible that the new interest in\nphysiology in cosmologies of the fifth century (e.g., those of\nEmpedocles and Anaxagoras) was due to the influence of Alcmaeon (Zhmud\n2012a, 366; 2014, 100).\n",
