    "main_text": "Basic Quotational Features\n2. Basic Quotational Features\n\nQuotation is a subject matter that brings together a rather\nspectacular array of linguistic and semantic issues. Here are six\nbasic quotational features of particular importance (BQ1\u2013BQ6,\nfor short) that will guide our search for an adequate account:\n\nBQ1. In quotation you cannot substitute\nco-referential or synonymous terms salva veritate.\n\nAn inference from (4) to (8), for example, fails to preserve\ntruth-value.\n\n(4)\n\u2018Bachelor\u2019 has eight letters\n(8)\n\u2018Unmarried man\u2019 has eight letters\n\n\nNo theory of quotation is adequate unless it explains this feature\n(and no theory of opacity is complete before it explains why quotation\nhas this feature).\n\nBQ2. It is not possible to quantify into\nquotation.\n\n(9), for example, does not follow from (4):\n\n(9)\n\\((\\exists x)\\)(\u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 has eight letters)\n\n\n\nAn adequate theory of quotation must explain why not. The product of\nquoting \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 is an expression that refers to the\n24th letter of the Roman alphabet. The point is that\nquotation marks, at least in natural language, cannot be quantified\ninto because they trap the variable; what results is a quotation that\nrefers to that very variable. Together, BQ1 and BQ2 place tough\nconstraints on developing a compositional theory for quotation:\nBQ1 would suggest quotational environments are opaque\nyet opaque environments often permit quantifying in which, per\nBQ2, quotation doesn\u2019t. For discussion of\ncompositionality and quotation, see Pagin and Westerst\u00e5hl 2010,\nBazzoni 2016, and Rabern 2022.\n\nBQ3. Quotation can be used to introduce novel\nwords, symbols and alphabets; it is not limited to the extant lexicon\nof any one language.\n\nBoth (10) and (11) are true English sentences:\n\n(10)\n\u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 is not a part of any English expression. \n(11)\n\u2018\u2766\u2019 is not an expression in any natural\nlanguage.\n\n\nAn adequate theory of quotation must explain what makes this practice\npossible.\n\nBQ4. There\u2019s a particularly close\nrelationship between quotations and their semantic values.\n\n\u201clobsters\u201d and its semantic value are more intimately\nrelated than \u2018lobster\u2019 and its semantic value, i.e., the\nrelationship between \u201clobster\u201d and \u2018lobster\u2019\nis closer than that which obtains between \u2018lobsters\u2019 and\nlobsters. Whereas the quotation (i.e., \u201clobster\u201d), in some\nway to be further explained, has its referent (i.e.,\n\u2018lobster\u2019) contained in it, the semantic value of\n\u2018lobsters\u2019, i.e., lobsters, are not contained in\n\u2018lobster\u2019. One way to put it is that an expression e is\nin the quotation of e. No matter how one chooses to spell\nthis out, any theory of quotation must explain this relationship.\n\nBQ5. To understand quotation is to have an\ninfinite capacity, a capacity to understand and generate a potential\ninfinity of new quotations.\n\nWe don\u2019t learn quotations one by one. Never having encountered\nthe quotation in (10) or (11) does nothing to prohibit comprehending\nthem (Christensen 1967, p. 362) and identifying their semantic\nvalues.\n\nSimilarly, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any upper bound on a\nspeaker\u2019s ability to generate novel quotations. One natural\nexplanation for this is that quotation is a productive device\nin natural language.\n\nBQ6. Quoted words can be simultaneously used and\nmentioned. This is an important observation due to Davidson,\nas exemplified in\n (12).[3]\n\n(12)\nQuine said that quotation \u2018has a certain anomalous\nfeature\u2019.\n\n\n(12) is called a \u2018mixed quotation\u2019. This is because it\nmixes the direct quotation (as in (5)) and indirect (as in (13)).\n\n(5)\nQuine said \u2018quotation has a certain anomalous\nfeature\u2019.\n(13)\nQuine said that quotation has a certain anomalous feature.\n\n\nIn this regard, the quotation in (12) is, in an intuitive sense,\nsimultaneously used and mentioned. It is used to say what Quine said\n(viz. that quotation has a certain anomalous feature), and\nalso to say that Quine used the words \u2018has a certain anomalous\nfeature\u2019 in saying it.\n\nMixed quotation had not been much discussed prior to Davidson (1979)\nbut it has recently taken center stage in discussions of theories of\nquotation. For those who believe themselves unfamiliar with the data,\nwe point out that mixed quotation is one of the most frequently used\nforms of quotation. Casually peruse any newspaper and you will find\npassages like the following from the New York Times:\n\nNYT Dec 7, 2004: The court ruled that the sentence was\ninvalid because the document signed into law by President Bill Clinton\ncontained a phrase that was illogical. The law said that defendants\nlike Mr. Pabon, who was convicted two years ago of advertising to\nreceive or distribute child pornography over the Internet, should be\nfined or receive a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years \u2018and\nboth.\u2019 The appeals court said this language \u2018makes no\nsense.\u2019\n\n\nIn the 21st century, mixed quotation has become one of the central\ntopics in the theory of quotation: a range of interesting data has\nbeen brought to light and a flurry of theories have been defended. In\n Section 4\n below we introduce some of the data.\n\nIn what follows we will refer back to these six features and make the\nfollowing assumption:\n\nIt is a necessary adequacy condition on a theory of quotation that it\neither explains how quotations can exhibit features (BQ1)\u2013(BQ6),\nor, if it fails to do so, then it must present an argument for why any\nunexplained feature doesn\u2019t require explanation.\n\nBefore going on, an important note: quotation, perhaps more than any\nother area of language, is difficult because not only is there no\nconsensus about what the correct theory is, but there\u2019s also\nbasic disagreements about the space of options, and about the data to\nbe accounted for. We\u2019ll see this below, but it\u2019s important\nto bear in mind that when it comes to quotation, the consensus is that\nthere\u2019s no consensus, and disagreement is the norm.\n",
