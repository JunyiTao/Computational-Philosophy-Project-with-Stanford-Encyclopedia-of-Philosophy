    "main_text": "Modal theories of ability || The modal analysis: linguistic considerations\n4.3 The modal analysis: linguistic considerations\n\nIn the material mode, the modal analysis gives an account of what it\nis to have an ability in terms of quantification over possible worlds.\nIn the formal mode, it gives a semantics for the ascription of ability\n\u2014 paradigmatically, sentences involving \u2018can\u2019 or\n\u2018is able to\u2019 \u2014 in terms of quantification over\npossible worlds.\n\nThis formal aspect of the modal analysis has been prominent in the\nphilosophical and linguistic literature because the standard semantics\nfor ability ascriptions is an explicitly modal one. This is the view\ndeveloped in a series of papers by Angelika Kratzer (Kratzer 2012).\nKratzer treats expressions such as \u2018S\ncan A\u2019 and \u2018S is able\nto A\u2019 as possibility claims. That is, \u2018S\nis able to A\u2019 is true just in case there is a possible\nworld w meeting certain conditions at which S\ndoes A. The conditions are that (i) w be accessible\ngiven some contextually-specified set of facts (the\nmodal base) and (ii) that w be at least as good,\naccording to a contextually-specified ranking of worlds\n(the ordering source), as any other accessible world. The\nKratzer semantics is thus an instance of the modal analysis on its\nsemantic formulation:\n\n(MAsemantic) \u2018S is able to A\u2019\nis true iff S does A at some world (or set of\nworlds) satisfying condition C.\n\n\nA number of objection have been brought against the modal analysis in\nthis latter, formal, aspect.\n\nOne objection prominent in the recent literature (Mandelkern et al.\n2017; Schwarz 2020) is that Kratzer\u2019s semantics, or any analysis\nof the form of (MAsemantic), appears to have trouble\nmarking an intuitive distinction between what someone is able to do\nand what it is possible for her to do. Let us say that an unskilled\ndarts-player is about to throw a dart. She utters:\n\n(3) I am able to hit the bullseye\n\n\nIntuitively, what she says is false: she is not able to hit the\nbullseye, as she is a poor darts-player. Yet there is an accessible\nand perfectly good possible world w at which she hits the\nbullseye \u2014 which is just to say, in the object language, that it\nis possible for her to hit the bullseye.\n\nThis case suggests the Kratzer semantics lacks the resources to\ncapture the distinctively agentive force of a sentences such as (3).\nThere are, in addition, a number of other outstanding empirical\nproblems for Kratzer\u2019s semantics for ability modals. One is the\nproblem of accounting for \u2018compulsion\u2019 modals such as\n\u2018I cannot but tell the truth\u2019 (Mandelkern et al. 2017).\nAnother is that of accommodating the \u2018actuality\nentailment\u2019 whereby, in many languages, certain ability\nsentences entail that the act in question was actually performed\n(Bhatt 1999; see also Hacquard 2009). Whatever our verdict on\n(MAsemantic), the semantics of ability-ascriptions remains\nan unresolved and potentially rich issue at the boundary of\nlinguistics and the philosophy of action.\n",
