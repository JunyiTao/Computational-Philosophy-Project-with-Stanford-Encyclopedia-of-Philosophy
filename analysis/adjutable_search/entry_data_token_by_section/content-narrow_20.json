    "main_text": "Types and Tokens\n6. Types and Tokens\n\nWe have frequently considered the narrow content of Oscar\u2019s\nbeliefs about water, for instance his belief that water is wet. Is the\nmental state we are concerned with here a type or a token? That is,\nare we concerned with a particular instance of a mental state, which\noccurs at a particular place and time, namely Oscar\u2019s belief on\nthis particular occasion that water is wet, or are we concerned with a\ngeneral kind of belief, the belief that water is wet, which many\ndifferent people could have on many different occasions?\n\nIt seems that it cannot be the general type of belief that we are\ninterested in here, at least not if the type in question is\n\u201cbelief that water is wet,\u201d since different people (or\neven the same person on different occasions) could have beliefs of\nthis type which had different narrow contents. Oscar is ignorant of\nthe molecular structure of water; he identifies water as a clear,\nodorless, colorless substance that falls from the skies and fills the\nlakes. As we have already seen, Twin Oscar shares Oscar\u2019s narrow\ncontent, but in his environment this narrow content determines that he\nbelieves that XYZ is wet, not that water is wet. However, an earthly\nexpert chemist who has done years of laboratory research on water, and\nis well aware of its molecular structure, will have a different\nwater-concept than Oscar does, and his belief that water is wet will\nhave a different narrow content than Oscar\u2019s does. The\nchemist\u2019s Twin Earth duplicate does not believe that XYZ is wet,\nsince he is aware of the chemical composition of water and his beliefs\nexplicitly concern H2O. He believes that water is wet\n(though he also believes, falsely, that the substance that fills the\nlakes and emerges from the taps is water).\n\nAlthough Oscar and the chemist share the (broad) belief that water is\nwet, they have different narrow contents associated with this belief.\nSo when we say that it is a belief that has a particular narrow\ncontent, we cannot be speaking of a general type of belief, at least\nnot if the type is determined by the broad content of the belief.\nRather, we must be speaking of a particular token belief, in this case\nOscar\u2019s belief on a particular occasion that water is wet.\n\nWe cannot completely evade issues about the nature of the token mental\nstates we are considering, however. Even if the object of our concern\nis a particular token, we need to know how to identify the particular\ntoken we are interested in. Compare: suppose we decided we wanted to\nknow the weight of a certain animal. A first question would be whether\nwe are talking about a type of animal or a token animal. In this case\nwe almost certainly intend to refer to the token rather than the type.\n(If the token belongs to a type of animal all or most of whose tokens\nhave weights that fall in a fairly narrow range, we may later decide\nthat we can also assign a weight to the type, but it is the weight of\nthe tokens that is primary.) In this case there seems to be no\nproblem: we can easily determine the weight of this animal, and even\ndetermine what its weight would be in other environments, without\ndeciding whether the relevant type might be Pomeranians, or dogs, or\ncanines, for example.\n\nHowever, our ability to determine the weight of a token animal depends\non the fact that we already know what animals are and how to\nidentify them. If someone told us to find the weight of that\nthing over there, we would need a further specification of\nthe thing in question before we could find its weight. Which thing?\nThe dog? The dog\u2019s front leg? The dog\u2019s fur? The cat over\nthere next to the dog? Or possibly even the disjoint thing consisting\nof both the cat and the dog? It is not clear that asking about the\nnarrow content of Oscar\u2019s belief that water is wet is a much\nmore clearly defined task than asking about the weight of that thing\nover there. Do we really have a means of picking out the mental state\nin question in a way that distinguishes it from other beliefs in the\nvicinity? What properties does it have? For example, does it have a\nsyntactic structure? Is it an intrinsic state? Does it have a\nparticular location in the brain? Is it entirely distinct from\nOscar\u2019s beliefs that water is a liquid, that water can form\ndroplets, and that water feels a certain way to the touch?\n\nThe problem of identifying the bearer of narrow content is obviously\nclosely related to the problem of what to hold constant when employing\nthe diagonalization strategy. But the problem may also affect views on\nwhich we do not need to require that a token state be present in a\ncounterfactual situation in order to determine whether its narrow\ncontent would be true in that situation. It still seems that in order\nto know exactly what question we are asking, we need to know what it\nis whose content we are evaluating in the counterfactual situations.\nWe need to know what the token state is in the actual world whether or\nnot we insist on its presence in the counterfactual one.\n",
