    "main_text": "Falsafa: Neoplatonized Aristotelianism in the Islamic World || The Criticism of Atomism and Minima Naturalia\n2.3 The Criticism of Atomism and Minima Naturalia\n\nHaving shown how the notion of the continuous does not lead to the\nabsurdities presented by the atomists, the philosophers next argued\nthat atomism is itself conceptually incoherent. Perhaps the most\nimportant thing to bear in mind when considering Arabic-speaking\nphilosophers\u2019 arguments against atomism is the nature of the atoms\nthat they want to reject. \u201cAtom\u201d comes from the Greek\natomos and literally means that which cannot be cut or\ndivided. Within the medieval Muslim world, philosophers and\ntheologians alike recognized two sorts of division: \u201cphysical\ndivisibility\u201d and \u201cconceptual divisibility.\u201d The\nfirst and true sense of divisibility for Avicenna, physical\ndivisibility, is the form of division that actually brings about a\nseparation and discontinuity within the magnitude. It involves\nphysically dividing a magnitude into two actually distinct parts. The\nsecond type of division, namely, conceptual divisibility, involves\nonly the accidental partition of the magnitude. The parts involved in\nthis type of divisibility are the accidental parts noted above that\nresult from a certain psychological process, namely, division through\nmere positing. As for their critique of atomic theories of magnitude,\nthey came in two general forms: arguments attempting to show that\natomism cannot even approximate our best mathematics and arguments\nattempting to show that the notion of minimal parts that are not even\nconceptually divisible is inadequate to describe certain basic natural\nphenomena.\n\nThe most common mathematical criticism against atomism was that if\natomism were correct, then one could not even approximate the\nPythagorean theorem, and yet the Pythagorean theorem is the best\nattested theorem in mathematics (e.g., Avicenna 1983, III.4, 190). The\nargument begins by envisioning atomic space something like a\nchessboard, which is a fair approximation of how the theologians did\nthink of atomic space. Next imagine inscribed on this atomic space a\nright isosceles triangle, whose legs are four atoms longs. The length\nof the hypotenuse of the triangle must equal the number of atoms that\nrun down the diagonal of the purported atomic square; however, given\nthat the space is atomic, that length would be only four atoms long.\nNow since according to the Pythagorean theorem the square of the sum\nof the legs should equal the square of hypotenuse, one would have\n42 + 42 = 42, if the space were\natomic, but this is clearly false. Since the absurdity arose from\ntaking jointly the two assumptions that the space is atomic and the\nPythagorean theorem, one of them must be rejected, and the obvious\ncandidate is to deny that there are minimal atomic units of magnitude.\nIt does no good to say that the diagonal of an atom is longer than its\nsides; for such an assumption entails that there are lengths shorter\nthan the smallest part, namely, that amount by which the atom\u2019s\ndiagonal is supposedly longer than its side, but a length shorter than\nthe shortest length is a contradiction. In short, it would seem that\nif the Pythagorean theorem is correct, then the atomism of the\ntheologians is false.\n\nA second type of argument used against atomism involved showing that\nthat the notion of conceptually minimal parts was philosophically and\nscientifically wanting (e.g., Avicenna 1983, III.4, 189\u2013190).\nThe issue at stake concerned how atoms could be aggregated so as to\ngive rise to the physical bodies that we observe around us. There seem\nto be four possible ways: (1) the atoms could be in succession with\none another, but in no way touching one another; or the atoms could be\ntouching one another, in which case they might do so by being (2)\ncontiguous with one another, (3) continuous with one another, or (4)\ninterpenetrating one another. Clearly the bodies we observe around us\nare unified wholes, that is, their parts are together and so form\nsolids rather than being \u2018cloud like.\u2019 Thus the atoms\ncannot merely be in succession. If the atoms were in contact with one\nanother by interpenetrating each other, then bodies would never be\nlarger than a single atom, but again this outcome is empirically\nfalse. Thus, atoms must be in contact by either being contiguous or\ncontinuous with one another. In that case, however, imagine three\natoms, ABC, that are either contiguous with\nor continuous with one another. In this case, B must be\nseparating A from C; for if B were not\nseparating A from C, then, for instance, A\ncould be in contact with C despite B\u2018s\npresence such that A would in fact be interpenetrating\nB; but this alternative has already been excluded.\nConsequently, there must be something, x, in virtue of which\nB is in contact with A and something, y, in\nvirtue of which B is in contact with C, and\nx and y must be separate from each other, otherwise\nA and C would not be separate from each other. In\nthat case, however, B can be conceptually divided into\nx and y, and yet B was assumed to be a\nconceptually indivisible, and so there is a contradiction. In short,\nthe conceptually indivisible parts of the atomists are inadequate to\nexplain the existence of the physical bodies that we observe around\nus.\n\nDespite their rejection of conceptually minimal parts, certain Muslim\nphilosophers, following Aristotle (Physics, 1.4,\n187b13\u201321) and some of this Greek commentators such as John\nPhiloponus (d. 570), conceded that bodies do have physically minimal\nparts. To be exact they recognized minima naturalia, that is\nlimits to how far a specific kind of body, like water or flesh, could\nphysically be divided and still remain that specific kind of body and\nnot instead be converted into some other kind of body (Avicenna, 2009,\nIII.12, 2\u20139; Averroes, 1962, ad 1.4 & 3.7; for\nstudies see Glasner, 2001 & 2009, ch. 8; Cerami, 2012; McGinnis,\n2015). In order to appreciate one version of their argument for\nminima naturalia (Avicenna 2009, III.12, 8), one must first\nconsider the theory of the elements and elemental change, which it\npresupposes. According to ancient and medieval elemental theory there\nare associated with each of the traditional four elements two primary\nqualities, one each from two pairs. These pairs include the primary\nqualities hot/cold and wet/dry. The element earth is associated with\nthe qualities cold-dry, water with cold-wet, air with hot-wet and fire\nwith hot-dry. These primary qualities are related to the elements\u2019\nmaterial cause. When these primary qualities are altered through a\nprocess of physical causation\u2014that is, there is some motion or\nchange in the element such as an increase or decrease in the degree of\nhotness, coldness, dryness or wetness\u2014the alteration prepares or\npre-disposes the underlying matter so that it is suited to receive a\nnew substantial form. So, for example, when water, which again is\nassociated with a cold-wet combination, is sufficiently heated, the\nunderlying qualitative disposition is no longer suited to the\nsubstantial form of water. Consequently, at some point in the heating\nprocess the matter receives a new substantial form that is compatible\nwith the matter\u2019s new underlying qualitative disposition, namely, the\nmatter receives the form of air. And, indeed, the steam produced from\nvigorously heating water does have a definite air-like quality. An\naccount similar to the one just limned also applies to more complex\ncases of mixtures, like blood, flesh, and seeds, which are involved in\nanimal and plant generation.\n\nAs for the proof for the existence of minima naturalia\nitself, it begins by repeating that division is spoken of in two ways:\nphysical division\u2014which brings about an actual division,\nseverance or fragmentation of the magnitude\u2014and conceptual\ndivision\u2014which involves a mere mental division or positing that\nleaves the magnitude intact. Again the argument is specifically about\nphysical divisibility. The argument runs thus: The smaller the\nquantity of a given substance the more apt it is to be acted upon by\nsurrounding bodies. So, for example, all things being equal, it takes\nlonger for a body of water to cool down a ton of molten iron than for\nthat same body of water to cool down an ounce of molten iron, and\nsimilarly, a blast furnace is able to heat the same ounce more quickly\nthan the ton. So again the smaller the physical divisions of a given\nsubstance are, the more disposed that reduced quantity of the\nsubstance becomes to the primary qualities of the surrounding bodies.\nBelow a certain limit, the ratio between the strength of the primary\nqualities of the surrounding bodies and those of the body being\ndivided is such that the qualities of the surrounding bodies overcome\nthose of the divided body. At that moment, the divided substance\u2019s\nunderlying qualitative disposition becomes altered so as no longer to\nbe suitable to its elemental form, and the matter receives a new\nsubstantial form. So, for example, imagine a cup of water that is\nsurrounded by hot, dry summer air. Now imagine half that amount of\nwater, and then keep taking halves. At some point the amount of water\nis so small that the water simply evaporates as it were\ninstantaneously, or, as medieval natural philosophers would have it,\nthe form of water in that minuscule physical quantity is immediately\nreplaced with the form of air. In short, for these thinkers the\nelements, as well as more complex mixtures, have natural minima beyond\nwhich they cannot be divided and still be capable of retaining their\nspecies form, for the primary qualities of the surrounding bodies so\nalter that body that it is no longer suitable for sustaining its\ninitial form. There must be, then, the argument concludes, minima\nnaturalia.\n",
