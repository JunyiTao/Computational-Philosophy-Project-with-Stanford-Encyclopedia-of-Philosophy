    "main_text": "\n\nProperties are those entities that can be predicated of\nthings or, in other words, attributed to them. Thus,\nproperties are often called predicables. Other terms for them\nare \u201cattributes\u201d, \u201cqualities\u201d,\n\u201cfeatures\u201d, \u201ccharacteristics\u201d,\n\u201ctypes\u201d. Properties are also ways things are, entities\nthat things exemplify or instantiate. For example,\nif we say that this is a leaf and is green, we are attributing the\nproperties leaf and green to it, and, if the\npredication is veridical, the thing in question exemplifies these\nproperties. Hence, properties can also be characterized as\nexemplifiables, with the controversial exception of those\nthat cannot be instantiated, e.g., some would say, round and\nsquare. It is typically assumed that no other entities can be\npredicated and exemplified (Aristotle, Categories, 2a). For\nexample, ordinary objects like apples and chairs cannot be predicated\nof, and are not exemplified by, anything.\n\nThe nature and existence of properties have always been central and\ncontroversial issues in philosophy since its origin, and interest in\nthem keeps flourishing, as Allen\u2019s (2016) recent introductory\ntext well testifies (see also surveys or anthologies such as Loux\n1972; Oliver 1996; Mellor and Oliver 1997; Koons and Pickavance 2017;\nMarmodoro and Mayr 2019). At least since Plato, who called them\n\u201cideas\u201d or \u201cforms\u201d, properties are viewed as\nuniversals, i.e., as capable, (in typical cases) of being\ninstantiated by different objects, \u201cshared\u201d by them, as it\nwere; consequently, in contrast with particulars, or\nindividuals, of being somehow at once in different\n places.[1]\n For example, if there are two potatoes each of which weighs 300\ngrams, the property weighing 300 grams is instantiated by two\nparticulars and is therefore multi-located. According to a different\nconception, however, properties are themselves particulars, though\nabstract ones. As so conceived, properties are nowadays\ncommonly called\n tropes,\n and are the subject of another entry. Here we shall focus on\nproperties as universals. Relations, e.g., loving and\nbetween, can also be considered properties: they are\npredicable, exemplifiable, and viewable as universals. Accordingly, we\nuse \u201cproperty\u201d as a generic term that also covers them,\nunless the context suggests otherwise. However, we shall consider\ntheir peculiarity only to a minimum extent, since they are discussed\nin detail in the entry on\n relations.\n\nIn \u00a71 we consider some most fundamental themes, including the\nmain motivations and arguments for including properties in one\u2019s\nontology. In \u00a72 we deal with the central topic of what it is for\nproperties to be exemplified. In \u00a73 we tackle the intertwined\nissues of the existence and identity conditions for properties. In\n\u00a74 we consider different senses in which properties may be\nstructurally complex. In \u00a75 we survey the frequent appeal to\nproperties in current metaphysics of science. In \u00a76 we conclude\nwith a review of formal accounts of properties and their applications\nin natural language semantics and the foundations of mathematics,\nwhich provide additional motivations for an ontological commitment to\nproperties.\n",
