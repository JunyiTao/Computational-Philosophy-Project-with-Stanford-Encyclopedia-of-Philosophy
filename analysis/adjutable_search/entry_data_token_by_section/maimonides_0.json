    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nMaimonides was born to a distinguished family in Cordova, Spain in\n 1138.[1]\n At that point, Cordova was under Muslim rule and stood as one of the\ngreat intellectual centers of the world. In addition to Maimonides, it\nwas the birthplace of Averroes. But events took a turn for the worse\nwhen the Almohads invaded in 1148 and offered all non-Muslims the\nchoice of conversion, exile, or death. Maimonides\u2019 family was forced to\nleave Cordova and travel through southern Spain and arrived in Fez,\nMorocco in 1160. His first philosophic work of note was the\nTreatise on the Art of Logic. Around this time, he began work\non his first religious masterpiece, the Commentary on the\nMishnah, which was finished in 1168. It is noteworthy for the\nemphasis Maimonides places on Oral Torah, by which he means the\ndetails, specifications, and interpretations derived from the Written\nTorah, which was revealed to Moses at Sinai.\n\n\nIt is also noteworthy for Maimonides\u2019 commentary on Chapter 10 of\nthe Mishnaic tractate Sanhedrin. While discussing the claim\nthat all Israel has a share in the world to come, Maimonides lists 13\nprinciples that he considers binding on every Jew: the existence of\nGod, the absolute unity of God, the incorporeality of God, the eternity\nof God, that God alone is to be worshipped, that God communicates to\nprophets, that Moses is the greatest prophet, that the Torah was given\nby God, that the Torah is immutable, that there is divine providence,\nthat there is divine punishment and reward, that there will be a\nMessiah, that the dead will be\n resurrected.[2]\n This was the first attempt to introduce articles of faith\nto Judaism and set off a controversy that persists to this day\n(Kellner 1986, 1999).\n\n\nMaimonides arrived in Egypt in 1166 and eventually settled in\nFustat, a section of Cairo. With the publication of the Mishneh\nTorah, he established himself as a thinker for the ages. Not only\ndoes this work systematize all the commandments of the Torah, it tries\nto show that every part of Jewish law serves a rational purpose and\nnothing is given for the sake of mere obedience.\n\n\nOf particular note are Book One (The Book of Knowledge),\nwhich sets forth the philosophic foundations of Jewish belief, a theory\nof moral traits or dispositions, the need to study the Torah, the laws\nconcerning idolatry, and the importance of repentance. Also of note is\nBook Fourteen (Judges), which ends by arguing that a Messiah\nwill come, restore sovereignty to Israel, establish peace with the\nother nations, and lead the world in the study of science and\nphilosophy. By contrast, the Messiah will not make people rich,\nintroduce changes in the Torah, or be required to perform miracles.\n\n\nThe Guide of the Perplexed was completed in 1190 and\ncontains Maimonides\u2019 most extensive philosophic discussions. Ostensibly\na letter written to an advanced student who cannot decide whether to\nfollow philosophy or the teachings of his religion, it is in reality\nmuch more: a commentary on biblical terms that appear to ascribe\ncorporeal qualities to God, an uncompromising defense of negative\ntheology, an extended critique of the kalam, a systematic treatment of\ncreation, prophecy, and providence, and a theory of jurisprudence.\n\n\nAccording to Maimonides, all of Jewish law aims at two things: the\nimprovement of the body and the improvement of the soul. The former is\nin every case a means to the latter. The soul is improved by acquiring\ncorrect opinions and eventually knowledge on everything humans are\ncapable of knowing. The more knowledge the soul acquires, the more it\nis able to fulfill the commandment (Deuteronomy 6:5) to love God. The\nbiggest stumbling block to love of God is the belief that the only way\nto remain true to the Bible is to interpret it literally. The result of\nliteral interpretation is a material conception of God, which, in\nMaimonides\u2019 opinion, amounts to idolatry.\n\n\nThe Guide has long been considered a controversial work and\nin some rabbinic circles was originally banned. By rejecting literal\ninterpretation, it raises the question of whether Maimonides\u2019 reading\nof the Torah corresponds to what the prophets understood or represents\na philosophic reconstruction that owes more to Aristotle and Alfarabi\nthan it does to Moses. It also raises the question of whether the real\nmeaning of the Torah is too controversial to be taught to the average\nworshipper and should be restricted to the educated few; in short the\nquestion of esotericism.\n\n\nMaimonides\u2019 last two works of note are the Treatise on\nResurrection, published in 1191, and the Letter on\nAstrology, published in\n 1195.[3]\n The former was written in answer to the charge that while\nhe may profess belief in bodily resurrection, Maimonides did not really\nhold it. The charge is not without merit given that Maimonides\u2019\nconception of the afterlife is purely intellectual and that his\nnaturalism makes him suspicious of miracles. He defends himself by\nsaying that the important issue is not whether and how resurrection\nwill occur but whether it is possible for it to occur. As for the\nlatter, once one accepts belief in creation, the possibility of bodily\nresurrection follows immediately. The Letter on Astrology was\nwritten at a time when many people believed that the heavenly bodies\nexert influence over human events. Nevertheless, he argues that there\nis no scientific basis for this belief and that it should be abandoned\neven if support for it can be found in the sacred literature.\n\n\nFacing ever-growing demands on his time, Maimonides worked himself\ninto a state of exhaustion and died in Fostat in 1204. An old saying\nhas it that from Moses to Moses, there was none like Moses.\n",
