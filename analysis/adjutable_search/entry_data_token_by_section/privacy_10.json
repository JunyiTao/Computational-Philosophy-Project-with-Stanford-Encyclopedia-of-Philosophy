    "main_text": "Meaning and Value || Normative Approaches\n3.3 Normative Approaches\n\nLet us now have a closer look at the normative side of the\nconcept of privacy\u2019s value or function. As will be seen, when\ndetermining the supposedly descriptive meaning of privacy, attempts\nare usually made to describe privacy at the same time in normative\nterms. Let us emphasize again that it is particularly difficult to\nseparate the descriptive and normative (value-laden) aspects of the\nconcept of privacy.\n3.3.1 Intrinsic vs Instrumental\n\nWith the above in mind, we can begin by separating instrumental and\nintrinsic approaches to the value of privacy. We speak of the\ninstrumental value of privacy when it is valued for the sake\nof something else (e.g., intimate relations, the body, freedom,\nautonomy, or dignity; Stigler 1980; Posner 1981). Intrinsic\nvalue is when privacy is valued for its own sake, without reference to\nany other objects, concepts of value, or dimensions in life (Warren\n& Brandeis 1890; Bloustein 1964; Gerstein 1978; Gavison 1980;\nParent 1983).\n\nThis idea of an intrinsic value to privacy has, however, been\ncriticized. An example is Fried\u2019s criticism:\n\n\nIt is just because this instrumental analysis makes privacy so\nvulnerable that we feel impelled to assign to privacy some intrinsic\nsignificance. But to translate privacy to the level of an intrinsic\nvalue might seem more a way of cutting off analysis than of carrying\nit forward. (1970: 140)\n\n\nFried thus claims that even when we say we value something no matter\nwhat, we can still ask the question, \u201cwhy should this be\nso?\u201d However, the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic\nvalue is generally a widely debated philosophical topic\u2014not only\nin relation to privacy. One should therefore not expect it to be\nsettled in the domain of the philosophy of privacy (see entry on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic value ).\n3.3.2 Access Simpliciter\n\nAccess-based approaches have been put forward to answer the question\nof the meaning and value of privacy. A variety of formulations can be\nfound in the literature (e.g., Thomson 1975; Gavison 1980; Reiman\n1995; Allen 2000; Tavani & Moor 2001). Reiman, for instance,\ndefines privacy as \u201cthe condition in which others are deprived\nof access to you\u201d (1995: 30). Similarly, Allen suggests that\n\n\nprivacy refers to a degree of inaccessibility of a person or\ninformation about her to others\u2019 five senses and surveillance\ndevices. (2000: 867)\n\n\nA classic formulation has been offered by Ruth Gavison: \u201cAn\nindividual enjoys perfect privacy when he is completely inaccessible\nto others\u201d (1980: 428). All these suggestions assume that we\nvalue privacy and therefore need some restriction of access\nto it, see especially Reiman (1995).\n\nSissela Bok defines privacy as\n\n\nthe condition of being protected from unwanted access by\nothers\u2014either physical access, personal information, or\nattention. Claims to privacy are claims to control access. (1982:\n10)\n\n\nPrivacy is here defined as a condition in which one is protected in\nvarious respects from undesired intrusions by other people. Such a\nbroadly-based definition still seems likely to cover the whole range\nof meanings of the concept of privacy. Similar approaches are also\nfound with Benn (1988) and Schoeman (1992).\n\nThe access-based approach has been criticized, however. For instance,\nit is clear that one does not enjoy privacy after falling into a\ncrevasse, even though it does comply with the condition of\n\u201cinaccessibility\u201d (see Schoeman 1984b: 3). If a state of\nisolation, seclusion or secrecy is enforced and not freely chosen (in\nother words, when the person in question has no control over access),\nthen one would not describe it as \u201cprivate\u201d. Westin (1967:\n40) describes the solitary confinement of prisoners as an example of\n\u201ctoo much\u201d privacy. Furthermore, this criticism shows that\nwe think of privacy as a distinctly interpersonal phenomenon.\nIf I am stranded on a desert island, it makes no sense to say I enjoy\ncomplete privacy because there are no other people present that I\ncould be inaccessible to (Fried 1968).\n3.3.3 Controlling Access\n\nOther approaches to the meaning and value of privacy take the idea of\ncontrol as their very starting point, i.e., control over specific\nareas of privacy. The so-called control-based approach has\nbeen adopted in many writings on privacy in academic literature and\nbeyond (Westin 1967; Fried 1968; Scanlon 1975; Parent 1983; Inness\n1992; Bok 1982; Boyd 2010). Most control-based approaches justify this\ninterpretation of the value of privacy with the enabling of freedom:\nindividual freedom and autonomy are not possible without the\nprotection of private life (see Allen 1988; Jean Cohen 2002). It\nshould be pointed out, however, that access-based conceptions of\nprivacy could also imply that we value privacy because it enables\nfreedom. This is in fact Reiman\u2019s position (1995), and so this\nshould not be seen as a defining line of separation between the\napproaches. Finally, Bloustein argues that \u201cthe intrusion [of\nprivacy] is demeaning to individuality, is an affront to personal\ndignity\u201d (1964: 962).\n\nThe classic and very influential approach advocated by Westin defines\nprivacy as control over information:\n\n\nPrivacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to\ndetermine for themselves when, how and to what extent information\nabout them is communicated to others. (1967: 7; see also Gross\n1971)\n\n\nIn a similar vein to Westin, Fried defines privacy as \u201cthe\ncontrol we have over information about ourselves\u201d (1968: 482).\nFried also asserts that the reason we value privacy is that\nrelationships with other individuals (characterized by love,\nfriendship and trust, for example) essentially depend on the ability\nto share certain information which we would not share with those not\nin the relationship. Privacy thus provides the \u201cmeans for\nmodulating [\u2026] degrees of friendship\u201d (Fried 1968: 485),\nbecause we share more information with very close friends than we\nwould with others. Hence, what we really care about is the ability to\ncontrol the information that we share with others. The right to\nprivacy would protect the ability of an individual to shape meaningful\nrelations with others and would be justified by the importance of\nrelationships such as friendship, love and trust in human life (Fried\n1968: 484).\n\nThis control can not only be understood as being concerned with\ninformational privacy (as with Westin), but also in much broader\nterms. Iris Young writes: \u201cThe Private [is] what the individual\nchooses to withdraw from public view\u201d (1990: 119\u2013120).\nControl is here conceived as a retreat from visibility in the public\neye, as is echoed by Julie Inness:\n\n\nPrivacy is the state of the agent having control over a realm of\nintimacy, which contains her decisions about intimate access to\nherself (including intimate informational access) and her decisions\nabout her own intimate actions. (1992: 56)\n\n\nSince the values ascribed to privacy can differ, access-based\napproaches are compatible with this justification of the value of\nprivacy in terms of intimacy and closeness. Most control-based\napproaches, however, justify the value of privacy by citing the\nenabling of freedom: individual freedom and autonomy are not possible\nwithout the protection of a private life (Jean Cohen 2002). Jean Cohen\n(2002) gives a theoretical defense of a freedom-based view of the\nright to privacy. She defends a constructivist approach to privacy\nrights and intimacy, arguing that privacy rights protect personal\nautonomy, and that a right to privacy is indispensable for a free and\nautonomous life. Freedom and autonomy are in the control access-based\ninterpretation inherently linked with privacy: if I want to control\nthe access to myself (or to information about myself), then it is an\nexpression of my freedom to do so. Privacy has, in these approaches,\nsuch a high value because it protects my freedom to do what I want to\ndo at home (within the limits of the law), to control what people know\nabout me (also within limits) and to decide freely about myself and my\nbody (Jean Cohen 2002; Roessler 2004: 71ff). One aspect of the freedom\nor autonomy of persons is their freedom from unwanted observation and\nscrutiny. Benn (1984) emphasizes how respect for privacy effectively\nexpresses respect for persons and their personhood. He explains that\n\u201c[a] man\u2019s view of what he does may be radically altered\nby having to see it, as it were, through another man\u2019s\neyes\u201d (1984: 242). The necessity of adopting a different\nperspective on one\u2019s own behavior can be seen as a restriction\nof freedom in the sense of the freedom of self-presentation The basic\nidea of these approaches is that the freedom to play different roles,\nto present oneself in different ways, presupposes that a person, in a\ngiven relationship, can hide (keep private) aspects which she does not\nwant to be seen, to share. The other person would see her in a\ndifferent way, if he knew this other side of her. Thus, the freedom to\npresent oneself in this way, in this relationship,\nwould be thwarted. The social freedom to play different roles is\ndependent on being able to present oneself differently to neighbors,\nstudents, one\u2019s spouse. It is dependent on the protection of\nprivacy (Allen 1988; Goffman 1959 for further discussion; Goffman is\nan oft-quoted reference in the privacy literature). We need privacy\nprecisely to afford us spaces free from observation and scrutiny, in\norder to achieve the liberal ideals of freedom\u2014such as the ideal\nof personal relations, the ideal of \u201cthe politically free\nman\u201d, and the ideal of \u201cthe morally autonomous man\u201d\n(Benn 1984: 234).\n\nAdam Moore (2010) adopts yet another approach, which nonetheless\nshould be mentioned under the heading of control-based approaches. In\nthe explicit tradition of Aristotelian teleology, Moore steps off from\nan account of human nature to explain the value of privacy. Human\nnature, he argues, allows humans to flourish in a particularly human\nway. In order to flourish, humans need to develop their rational\nfaculties. This allows them, among other things, to live an autonomous\nlife. Among the necessary favorable external conditions which human\nbeings need to flourish, are the rights to and norms of privacy (A.\nMoore 2003).\n3.3.4 Controlling Access: Three Dimensions\n\nThe control-based approach has led to the suggestion that different\ndimensions of control can be distinguished, and that these have a\ndirect correlation with different areas of privacy. From a normative\nstandpoint, these dimensions\u2014not spaces\u2014of privacy serve\nto protect, facilitate, and effectuate access to what is conceived of\nas private, and to identify a range of different privacy norms that\nare supposed to protect and enable personal autonomy.\n\nOther authors suggest that the control-access definition of privacy is\nbest understood as a cluster concept covering interests in\n(a) control over information about oneself; (b) control over access to\noneself, both physically and mentally; and (c) control over\none\u2019s ability to make important decisions about family and\nlifestyle, so as to be self-expressive and to develop varied\nrelationships (DeCew 1997).\n\nRoessler (2001 [2005]) suggests that three dimensions of privacy\nshould be identified, namely decisional privacy, informational\nprivacy, and local privacy, meaning the traditional \u201cprivate\nsphere\u201d, mostly the home (the place, as opposed to information\nor actions). The justification for these different dimensions lies,\nshe argues, in their role in protecting personal autonomy. Without the\nprotection of privacy in these three dimensions, an autonomous and\nwell-lived life in a liberal democracy would not be possible. She\nexplains:\n\n\nThe dimension of decisional privacy serves to secure the\nscope for a subject to make decisions and take action in all his\nsocial relations. The dimension of informational privacy\nserves to secure a horizon of expectations regarding what others know\nabout him that is necessary for his autonomy. The dimension of\nlocal privacy serves to protect the possibilities for spatial\nwithdrawal upon which a subject is dependent for the sake of his\nautonomy. [The] aim is to show what the value of privacy inheres in\nand in what way the violation of these dimensions of privacy also\nentails a violation of the individual autonomy of the subject.\n(Roessler 2001 [2005: 16])\n\n\nProtection of personal privacy with respect to these three dimensions\nis also constitutive of social life (Fried 1968), as well as crucial\nfor democratic decision-making procedures (Stahl 2020; A. Roberts\n2022).\n3.3.5 Decisional Privacy\n\nThe three dimensions are anchored in different traditions of the\nconception of privacy, and have been discussed for many years. It is\nin recent years that decisional privacy, or the privacy of\nactions, has become a specialist term in the literature. Norms of\ndecisional privacy allow for the control of access to one\u2019s\ndecisional sphere. This concerns certain forms of behavior in public,\nquestions of lifestyle, and more fundamental decisions and actions\nwhere we may with good reason tell other people that such-and-such a\nmatter is none of their business (see Lanzing 2016; Sax 2018).\n\nA decisive factor in coining the concept of decisional privacy was the\nruling of the US Supreme Court in the Roe v. Wade case. As a\nresult of this landmark case, feminist theory has treated sexual\nfreedom of action, the privacy of intimate and sexual acts, and the\nwoman\u2019s right of sexual self-determination as central elements\nin the theory of privacy (Allen 1988). In the literature on privacy,\ndecisive significance is also given to the privacy of the\nbody (Gatens 1996, 2004). This includes the woman\u2019s\nnewly-won right to conceive of her body as private to the extent that\nshe can decide for herself whether or not to bear a child, and thus\nenjoy the right of reproductive freedom.\n\nSexual harassment and sexual orientation are two further central\naspects of decisional privacy, both of which concern the link between\nsexuality, the body, and identity, and are decisive for the societal\ncoding and meaning of privacy. Protection from sexual harassment and\nthe respect for diverse sexual orientations form dimensions of\ndecisional privacy precisely because it is the privacy of the body\nthat is vulnerable to infringement (see Jean Cohen 2002 for a\ncomprehensive discussion). For more on issues linked to power, see\n \u00a74.\n\nWe can distinguish between different aspects of decisional privacy\naccording to their social context, but the argument underlying the\nclaim to protection of such privacy remains structurally the same. If\none understands a person\u2019s self-determination and autonomy to\nconsist in the right to be the (part-) author of her own biography,\nthis must mean that within different social contexts she can demand\nthat her decisions and actions are respected (in the sense that they\nare \u201cnone of your business\u201d) by both social convention and\nstate law. The limits to this form of privacy are regulated by\nconvention and are of course subject to constant renegotiation. Yet\nthis sort of respect for a person\u2019s privacy\u2014applicable\nalso to public contexts\u2014is especially relevant for women. (For\nrelevant examples, see Nagel 1998a & 1998b; Allen 1988; Fraser\n1996; Gatens 2004). The spectrum of decisional privacy thus extends\nfrom reproductive rights to freedom of conduct in public space.\n3.3.6 Informational Privacy\n\nNorms of informational privacy allow people to control who knows what\nabout them. The knowledge other people have about us shapes the ways\nin which we can present ourselves, and act around others.\nInformational privacy is thus essentially linked to individual freedom\nand autonomy since it enables different forms of self-presentation, as\nwell as enabling different forms of social relationship (see Roessler\n2001 [2005: 111\u2013141] for more detail).\n\nDebates about informational privacy hearken back to the interpretation\nof the US Constitution, beginning with the essay written by Justices\nWarren and Brandeis. (That essay was written after what they felt was\nan invasion of privacy by intrusive paparazzi in 1890.) It was in that\nessay that, for the first time, the right to be left alone\nwas described as a constitutional right to privacy, in the sense that\ninformation about a person is worthy of protection even when it\ninvolves something that occurs in public (see\n \u00a71.2).\n\nThis form of privacy is relevant, primarily in friendships and love\nrelationships, and serves both as protection of relationships\nand as protection within relationships. In some theories of\nprivacy, this actually constitutes the very heart of privacy in the\nform of \u201crelational privacy\u201d, which guarantees\nopportunities for withdrawal that are constitutive for an authentic\nlife (Fried 1968; Rachels 1975). For further details, see entry on\n privacy and information technology.\n3.3.7 Local Privacy\n\nThe dimension of local privacy refers to the classic,\ntraditional place of privacy, thought of in terms of its most genuine\nlocus: one\u2019s own home. As we have already seen, this form of\nlocal privacy is not derived from a \u201cnatural\u201d separation\nof spheres, but rather from the value of being able to be able to\nwithdraw to within one\u2019s own four walls (see\n \u00a71\n and\n \u00a72\n above).\n\nTraditionally, two different aspects of privacy are of relevance here:\nsolitude and \u201cbeing-for-oneself\u201d on the one hand, and the\nprotection of family communities and relationships on the other.\nFirstly, people seek the solitude and isolation provided by the\nprotection of their private dwelling, in order to avoid confrontation\nwith others. This aspect of privacy also comes to the fore in the work\nof Virginia Woolf and George Orwell, for both of whom the privacy of\nthe room\u2014the privacy to write or think\u2014is a precondition\nfor the possibility of self-discovery and an authentic life (Orwell\n1949; Woolf 1929).\n\nLocal privacy also offers protection for family relationships. The\nprivacy of the household provides the opportunity for people to deal\nwith one another in a different manner, and to take a break from roles\nin a way that is not possible when dealing with one another in public.\nThis dimension or sphere of privacy, however, is especially prone to\ngenerate the potential for conflict. As has been made clear from\nprevious discussions, this has been a particularly important starting\npoint for feminist criticism. A conflict arises here between\ntraditional conceptions of privacy as constitutive of a loving family\nhaven, which has nothing to do with demands for justice or equal\nrights (Honneth 2004; contrast with Rawls 1997), and the critical\nfeminist approach (see Okin 1989 & 1991; Young 2004).\n4. Contemporary Debates\n\nContemporary debates on privacy are manifold, lively, and sometimes\nheated. They turn on a multitude of issues that are not only limited\nto informational privacy, but also include other dimensions of\nprivacy.\n4.1 Recent Debates on the Value or Function of Privacy\n\nConceptual and normative debates are still pervasive and persistent in\nthe literature, with the role of autonomy and the control-access\napproach being typical of contemporary discussion. A general\ndiscussion of privacy, not focused on one particular aspect but\nrather presenting the different threats to privacy, and its role and\nassociated tensions in discussions of advancing technology, can be\nfound in different recent comprehensive monographs, for instance in\nRule (2007), also in Rotenberg, Scott, and Horwitz (2015), in Citron\n(2022) as well as in Francis and Francis (2017); Focusing on more\nparticular aspects of the normative debates, Koops et al. (2017) have\ngiven a very helpful and informative overview over the different\npossibilities of defining the meaning and value of privacy. They aim\nat a typology of eight concepts of privacy:\n\n\nOur analysis led us to structure types of privacy in a two-dimensional\nmode, consisting of eight basic types of privacy (bodily,\nintellectual, spatial, decisional, communicational, associational,\nproprietary, and behavioral privacy), with an overlay of a ninth type\n(informational privacy) that overlaps, but does not coincide, with the\neight basic types. (2017: 483)\n\n\nThey also very helpfully explain the differences between access-based,\ncontrol-based and other approaches to the function and value of\nprivacy. Marmor (2015) argues that in the past it has been\nincreasingly difficult to argue for a general interest which privacy\nis to protect, especially because of the reductionist critique of\nThomson (1975); see\n \u00a72.1).\n Marmor goes on to claim, however,\n\n\nthat there is a general right to privacy grounded in people\u2019s\ninterest in having a reasonable measure of control over the ways in\nwhich they can present themselves (and what is theirs) to others.\n(2015: 3\u20134)\n\n\nMarmor presents an interesting version of a control-based theory of\nprivacy in defending the view that we have a basic interest in having\n(reasonable) control over evaluations of ourselves, which also means\nthat we have an interest in a predictable environment and a\npredictable flow of information (see 2015: 25). He is thereby in fact\nconnecting to other control-based approaches (see Jean Cohen 1992,\nalso Goffman 1959) as well as theories of privacy as contextual\nintegrity (see Nissenbaum 2010). Mainz and Uhrenfeldt (2021) also\nsupport the control-access approach to privacy, claiming that\n\n\nthere is at least a pro tanto reason to favor the control account of\nthe right to privacy over the access account of the right to privacy.\n(2021: 287)\n\n\nIn a slightly different manner, Gaukroger (2020: 416) claims that\nprivacy not only protects us when we act in morally right ways, but\nalso when we make use of the \u201cfreedom to be\nbad\u201d\u2014which he defends as a general good. Lundgren,\nhowever, disputes the control-access approach because of its\nfundamental difficulties. Following Parent, Lundgren argues that if we\nadopt a control based account, we lose privacy every time we give\nsomeone access to whatever it is we want to keep private which in fact\nmeans that we lose more and more of our privacy. Lundgren therefore\nargues for a \u201climited access\u201d (Lundgren 2020: 173)\nconception, criticizing many different forms of control-access\naccounts (2020: 167 fn 7). (By implicitly following Bloustein\u2019s\n(1964) plea for the centrality of the concept of human dignity,\nFloridi (2016) contends that the concept of dignity should be the\nfoundation of interpreting informational privacy, as understood by the\nGDPR.)\n\nA further development concerns the theory of contextual\nintegrity, as developed by Helen Nissenbaum. Nissenbaum\u2019s\nframework of Contextual Integrity has won enormous attention as the\nstandard to evaluate flows of personal information, their legitimacy\nand acceptability but has not remained undisputed. On the one hand,\nNissenbaum\u2019s paradigm has led to a great number of articles\napplying it to different societal fields and technology developments.\nShvartzshnaider et al. (2019) present \u201ca method for analyzing\nprivacy policies using the framework of contextual integrity\n(CI)\u201d. The authors claim that this\n\n\nmethod allows for the systematized detection of issues with privacy\npolicy statements that hinder readers\u2019 ability to understand and\nevaluate company data collection practices. (Shvartzshnaider et al.\n2019: 162)\n\n\nNissenbaum (2019) herself applies the approach of contextual integrity\nto a complex data network and argues that especially the contextual\nintegrity approach is able to identify those sources of disruption in\nnovel information practices which should be criticized (2019: 221; see\nalso Nissenbaum 2015). Another interesting example is Shaffer (2021)\nwho applies the Contextual Integrity Framework to new technologies for\nsmart cities. Winter and Davidson (2019) apply the approach of\ncontextual integrity to the problem of data governance in health\ninformation, since advances in collecting data\n\n\nalso pose significant data governance challenges for ensuring value\nfor individual, organizational, and societal stakeholders as well as\nindividual privacy and autonomy.\n\n\nThey go on to\n\n\ninvestigate how forms of data governance were adapted, as PHI\n[Personal Health Information] data flowed into new use contexts, to\naddress concerns of contextual integrity, which is violated when\npersonal information collected in one use context moves to another use\ncontext with different norms of appropriateness. (2019: 36)\n\n\nOn the other hand, some criticism has been raised which argues that\nNissenbaum does not actually provide normative standards to judge\nwhich information flows should be seen as ethically justified and\nwhich as detrimental (Rule 2019). Rule argues that\n\n\nnotions that norms underlying any given domain of human conduct are\nunambiguous or uncontested simply do not withstand close examination.\nIndeed, most social norms, particularly in rapidly changing domains of\nhuman conduct like privacy practices, are volatile and highly\ncontested. (2019: 260)\n\n\nIn a similar vein, DeCew (2015) questions the idea that in any given\ncontext, the governing norms might be not up to ethical standards and\nstill defendable on the basis of the integrity of the context and the\nnorms governing it, as is the case of the governing norms in the\ntraditional family (DeCew 2015: 215).\n\nFinally, the theory that private data should be seen as private\nproperty should be mentioned. This idea originated with\nLessig (2002) and has since been discussed by a number of authors.\nArguments exist for and against the idea that the agents generating\ndatapoints\u2014the source of the data\u2014have a right to claim\nthose datapoints as private property (Schneider 2021; see also Tufekci\n2015; Wu 2015).\n4.2 The Conflict between Privacy and Other Values or Rights\n\nNewell e.a. (2015) ushers in a cogent articulation and defense of\nprivacy even when privacy seems to conflict with other important\nvalues. Recent technological developments are concerning, with\nimplications for the moral, legal and social foundations and\ninterrelationships between privacy, security and accountability.\nKatell and Moore (2016: 3) make use of a control-based definition of\nprivacy, stating that a right to privacy is \u201ca right to control\naccess to, and uses of, places, bodies, and personal\ninformation\u201d. They also write that\n\n\nthe ability to control access to our bodies, capacities, and powers,\nand to sensitive personal information, is an essential part of human\nflourishing or well-being. (Katell & Moore 2016: 5)\n\n\nKenneth Himma\n\n\nargues that security is a more important right that always\n\u201ctrumps\u201d privacy, which on his view is not an absolute or\nfundamental right, but merely \u201cinstrumental\u201d to other\nrights. (Katell & Moore 2016: 12 and Himma 2016; both in A. Moore\n2016)\n\n\nHimma\u2019s defense is based on his view that security is\nfundamental to survival\u2014our most valuable duty and obligation.\nIn contrast, responding to this view, Adam Moore defends privacy over\nsecurity with multiple arguments, perhaps the most powerful of which\nis demonstrating \u201cthe importance of privacy as a bulwark against\nthe tyrannical excesses of an unchecked security state\u201d (Katell\n& Moore 2016: 13 and Moore 2016b). As the authors in this volume\nnote, there is good reason to conclude that privacy, security and\naccountability are all morally valuable.\n\nOver the course of the last few years (and especially between 2020 and\n2023), the conflict between privacy and health, or privacy and safety,\nhas been the topic of much discussion\u2014particularly from the\nperspective of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an early attempt to develop\nsuitable guidelines, Morley et al. (2020) have postulated that not\nonly should privacy be protected, but also equality and fairness\nobserved in digital contact-tracing. However, such contact-tracing\napps clearly bring about a conflict between privacy and the health of\npeople. Throughout the course of the pandemic, such contact-tracing\napps were contested (see Bengio et al. 2020; Fahey & Hino\n2020).\n4.3 The Cultural Relativity of the Value of Privacy\n Schoeman (1984b) has pointed out that the question of whether or\nnot privacy is culturally relative can be interpreted in different\nways. One question is whether privacy is deemed valuable to all\npeoples, or whether its value is relative and subject to cultural\ndifferences (see Westin 1967; Rachels 1975; Allen 1988; A. Moore\n2003). Another question is whether there are any aspects of life that\nare inherently private and not just conventionally so. There is also\nsome literature on the different cultures of privacy in different\nregions of the world. A growing number of articles are concerned with\nprivacy conceptions in China, not only due to technological\ndevelopments over the last years (as detailed in Ma 2019 for a\nrelational, Western-Eastern conception of privacy; H. Roberts 2022),\nbut also on earlier periods in Chinese culture, for instance on\nConfucian and Taoist thinking (Whitman 1985; for attitudes towards\nhealthcare, see Chen et al. 2007). Basu (2012) writes about the Indian\nperception of privacy, based on India\u2019s cultural values, and\noffers an explanation for why their concept of privacy seems to extend\nbeyond the often-dominating public-private dichotomy. Capurro (2005)\ndeals with intercultural aspects of privacy, particularly with regard\nto differences between Japanese and Western conceptions (see also\nNakada & Tamura 2005). For a perspective on the general Buddhist\ntheory of privacy, see Hongladarom (2016). The ubuntu perspective on\nprivacy is discussed by Reviglio and Alunge (2020).\n4.4 The Democratic Value of Privacy\n\nTheorists have repeatedly pointed to the connection between the\nprotection of privacy, understood as the protection of individual\nautonomy, and the protection of democracy (see Goold 2010:\n38\u201348). Hughes, for example, speaks of privacy as a\n\u201cbulwark against totalitarianism\u201d (2015: 228), while\nSpiros Simitis describes the right to privacy as \u201ca constitutive\nelement of a democratic society\u201d (1987: 732). Probably the\nbest-known advocate of privacy with a view to democracy is Ruth\nGavison. She argues that the protection of privacy both supports and\nencourages the moral autonomy of citizens, which is an essential\nprecondition of democratic societies (Gavison 1980: 455; see also\nHughes 2015: 228; Simitis 1987: 732; Solove 2008: 98\u2013100;\nSchwartz 1999). There can be no democratic self-determination without\nthe protection of privacy. Hence, government intervention for the\nsecurity of citizens becomes an ideology that threatens democracy when\nits goal is no longer the freedom of individuals\u2014that is, when\ncitizens are no longer treated by the state as democratic subjects,\nbut as objects.\n\nMokrosinska emphasizes privacy as a democratic value, thus\nstrengthening that value when it comes into competition with freedom\nof expression and other political interests. Privacy can facilitate\nsetting aside deep disagreements in order for political engagement in\na democracy to proceed. Thus, Mokrosinska proposes a strategy for\nmediating between privacy and free speech when they collide\n(Mokrosinska 2015). Lever, in a monograph on privacy and democracy,\ndevelops a comprehensive theory and argues that privacy is in\ndifferent ways essential for democracies and for the freedom,\nequality, and solidarity of democratic subjects (Lever 2013). From a\ndifferent perspective, Stahl (2020) discusses ways in which\n\u201csurveillance of intentionally public activities\u201d should\nbe criticized. Drawing on the theories of contextual integrity\n(Nissenbaum) and of the public sphere (Habermas), Stahl argues\nthat\n\n\nstrategic surveillance of the public sphere can undermine the capacity\nof citizens to freely deliberate in public and therefore conflicts\nwith democratic self-determination. (2020: 1)\n\n\nThe democratic value of privacy also plays a central role in\nRepublicanism, since threats to privacy are always also\nthreats to democracy. Republicans point out the value of privacy by\ncontrasting it to liberal theories, which cannot explain the\npossible threat to privacy\u2014not just the actual\ninterference\u2014as an encroachment on the freedom of subjects.\nAndrew Roberts (2015: 320) writes that for republicans, because\nprivacy\n\n\nis a pre-requisite for effective participation in political life, and\nrepublicans consider such participation to be the essence of\nself-government and the means through which a polity can secure\nconditions of freedom, in a republican democracy individual privacy\nwill be seen as a collective good.\n\n\n(For a far more elaborate account along similar lines, see A. Roberts\n2022; as well as Schwartz 1999)\n4.5 Group Privacy\n\nGroup privacy has entered philosophical discussion at a rather late\nstage, since it was only with the new forms of information and\ncommunication technology that groups could be targeted and surveilled\nefficiently. Research on group privacy addresses the fact that it is\nnot individuals that are targeted by data collection and profiling\npractices, but rather groups of individuals who share certain relevant\nfeatures. An important and influential collection of essays is that of\nTaylor, Floridi, and van der Sloot (2017a). Taylor et al. point out\nthat\n\n\nprofiling and machine learning technologies are directed at the group\nlevel and are used to formulate types, not tokens\u2014they work to\nscale, and enable their users to target the collective as much as the\nindividual. (2017b: 1)\n\n\nThe book discusses divergent perspectives on what a group is, how\ngroups should be addressed with regard to privacy, which elements of\nthe problem can be addressed using current legal and conceptual tools,\nand which will require new approaches.\n\nEspecially interesting is Floridi\u2019s argument that\n\n\ngroups are neither discovered nor invented but designed by the level\nof abstraction (LoA) at which a specific analysis of a social system\nis developed. Their design is therefore justified insofar as the\npurpose, guiding the choice of the LoA, is justified. (Floridi 2017:\n83)\n\n\nFloridi states that the claims that groups have rights and groups have\nprivacy are taken together in the argument that groups can have rights\nto privacy, and that indeed sometimes it is only the group which has\nprivacy and not its members. (2017: 83; see also Taylor 2017:\n13\u201336; van der Sloot 2017: 197\u2013224). Loi and Christen\n(2020) agree with Floridi\u2019s claim that groups can have rights to\nprivacy. However, they argue, against Floridi, for the distinction\nbetween two different concepts of privacy for groups:\n\n\nThe first (\u2026) deals with confidential information shared with\nthe member of a group and inaccessible to (all or a specific group of)\noutsiders. The second (\u2026) deals with the inferences that can be\nmade about a group of people defined by a feature, or combination\nthereof, shared by all individuals in the group. (Loi & Christen\n2020: 207)\n\n\nLoi and Christensen claim that it is the latter, the inferential\nnotion of privacy which is the one explaining group privacy. An\nabsolute right to this privacy, they conclude, is implausible.\n\nPuri (2021) criticizes the conventional liberal conception of privacy\nthat focuses excessively on the identification of the individual as\ninadequate in safeguarding the individual\u2019s identity and\nautonomy. Puri therefore develops\n\n\na theoretical framework in the form of a triumvirate model of the\ngroup right to privacy (GRP), which is based on privacy as a social\nvalue\u2026 [he also formulates] the concept of mutual or companion\nprivacy, which counterintuitively states that in the age of Big Data\nAnalytics, we have more privacy together rather than individually.\n(Puri 2021: 477)\n\n4.6 Social Dimensions of Privacy\n\nInterestingly, Puri (2021) connects the question of group privacy with\nthe one of the social dimensions of privacy. However, although both\ndiscourses share the critique of individualist conceptions of privacy\nand are interested in more than the individual\u2019s protection of\nprivacy, the latter tackles a different problem. The upshot of the\ndebates around the social dimensions of privacy is the claim that\nprivacy is not (only) a right or need for individuals, but protects,\nand ought to protect relations as well. Not all relations\nmake up a group, and privacy can, in some cases, constitute the very\nrelation it protects, as Roessler and Mokrosinska (2013) argue. James\nRachels and Charles Fried both recognized that privacy has a social\nvalue: relationships can only be protected when certain norms of\nprivacy apply both within relationships and to relationships (Fried\n1968; Rachels 1975). The various norms of informational privacy do not\nmerely regulate the social relationships and roles that we have in\nlife, they actually make them possible. The perspective of the\nindividual seems insufficient to account for many of the concerns\nraised in debates around privacy-invasive technologies. With\never-greater frequency, privacy-invasive technologies have been argued\nto endanger not only individual interests, but also to affect society\nand social life more generally. Therefore, not only the safeguarding\nof individual freedoms, but also the constitution and regulation of\nsocial relationships, are essential to privacy norms (see Roessler\n& Mokrosinska 2015).\n\nFollowing Fried (1968) and his theory describing the relational\ncharacter of the protection of individual privacy, one can argue that,\nwhile endorsing norms of informational privacy which should protect\nindividual privacy, this privacy at the same time plays an essential\nrole in social relations. Therefore, the protection of privacy is not\nalways and not necessarily in conflict with societal interests\n(Roessler & Mokrosinska 2013: 771).\n\nIn recent years, several scholars have taken important steps towards\ndeveloping a social approach to privacy. Arguing that an important\naspect of the significance of informational privacy is that it goes\nbeyond the interests of the individuals it protects, these scholars\nhave emphasized the way in which privacy enables social and\nprofessional relationships, democratic decision-making processes, and\npolitical participation. They have also stressed the necessary role of\nprivacy for cooperation and trust within various associations, such as\neconomic partnerships. Regan, Solove, and Nissenbaum also follow this\nline of thought. Famously, Regan argues that privacy is not only of\nvalue to the individual, but also to society in general. For Regan\nprivacy is a common value, a public value, and also a collective value\n(1995: 213; see Regan 2015: 50; Hughes 2015). Solove claims that\n\n\n[by] understanding privacy as shaped by the norms of society, we can\nbetter see why privacy should not be understood solely as an\nindividual right\u2026 the value of privacy should be understood in\nterms of its contribution to society. (2008: 98, 171fn)\n\n\nSolove believes privacy fosters and encourages the moral autonomy of\ncitizens, a central requirement of governance in a democracy. Regan\n(1995), Solove (2008) and Nissenbaum (2010) took the first steps in\nanalyzing the social dimensions and value of privacy in a democratic\nsociety and are now focusing on the role of privacy in political and\nsocial practice, law, media and communication, healthcare, and the\nmarketplace.\n\nThe social dimensions of privacy also play a crucial role in the\nsocial analysis of the family. DeCew and Moore assess the\npublic/private boundary in the family, given that family conventions\nare among the most crucial for this primary human socialization\nsetting, and also given that structures in the family often are\noppressive, as DeCew points out (see MacKinnon 1989).\n4.7 Privacy and the Datafication of Daily Life\n\nThe issue of the datafication of daily life and its relation to\nprivacy has been discussed from many different angles. One of the\nfirst areas of focus was \u201cambient intelligence\u201d (initially\nanalyzed by Brey 2005), and the \u201cinternet of things\u201d,\nwhich is still very widely discussed. Wachter, for instance, writes\nthat the\n\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) requires pervasive collection and linkage of\nuser data to provide personalised experiences based on potentially\ninvasive inferences. Consistent identification of users and devices is\nnecessary for this functionality, which poses risks to user privacy.\n(2018: 266)\n\n\nShe suggests guidelines for IoT developers which guarantee the\nprotection of privacy in accordance with the GDPR, in cases such as\nsmart homes and data gathered by Siri and Alexa (see also entries on\n privacy and information technology\n and\n ethics of artificial intelligence and robotics.)\n4.7.1 The Datafication of Life: Work\n\nMost of us spend a lot of time at work every day. It is the workplace\nwhere, in recent years, more and more employers have been observing\nwhat their employees are doing. This raises normative problems, such\nas the consequences of this surveillance for the autonomy of\nemployees, as well as for the relationship between employees and, of\ncourse, the question of how much privacy one can claim at the\nworkplace. A good overview of this topic is provided by Bhave, Teo,\nand Dalal (2020). Chamorro-Premuzic and Buchband (2020) demonstrate\nthe importance of clear communications with employees explaining the\nreasons for, and existence of, corporate monitoring programs.\n4.7.2 The Datafication of Life: Commercial Health Apps\n\nFrom the perspective of the datafied life, the development of\ncommercial health apps\u2014which have become increasingly\ncommonplace in recent years\u2014is particularly important. They\nbecame especially relevant given COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, when\npeople became not only more interested in sporting activities, but\nalso in measuring them and finding motivation through interpreting\nrelated data. Commercial health app developers have exploited this,\nand are often not sufficiently clear about the dangers of data\ncollection for the protection of privacy (Sax 2021). Huckvale, Torous,\nand Larsen (2019) point to these dangers and explain their nature, as\ndoes Mulder (2019), who examines app providers and their marketing\nstatements with respect to the extent to which they actually meet the\nrequirements of the GDPR. A different, but equally important point\nconcerns women\u2019s health data and how the recent decision of the\nUS Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade affects the privacy\nof the health-data of women (see Cox 2022; the Dobbs v. Jackson\nWomen\u2019s Health Organization is also relevant at this\npoint).\n4.7.3 The Datafication of Life: The Privacy Paradox\n\nIt is often reported that people who talk generously about their\nprivate lives in social media still claim that they regard\ninformational privacy as a very valuable asset, and that the state has\nan obligation to guarantee their informational privacy protection.\nObservations about the online behavior of young people in particular\nhave led theorists to use the term \u201cprivacy paradox\u201d in\nrecent years (Hargittai & Marwick 2016: 3737). Martin and\nNissenbaum (2016), however, argue against a paradox: they present a\nsurvey with\n\n\nquestions that insert ranges of values for the respective parameters\ncontextual integrity asserts as fundamental to informational\nstandards. (Martin & Nissenbaum 2016: 217)\n\n\nThe argument from contextual integrity demonstrates that whether\npeople see any given data flow as violating privacy depends on the\nvalues for five parameters: sender, recipient, data subject,\ntransmission principle, and type of information. Martin and Nissenbaum\nargue that if one describes a situation in which information or data\nflows without specifying values for all the parameters, one is thereby\noffering an ambiguous description. Their study on\n\u201csensitive\u201d information demonstrates that although people\nconsistently rank certain types of information as more or less\nsensitive, their reactions vary quite significantly when the recipient\nis specified, e.g., health information to an advertiser versus to a\nphysician. Thus, when people post information on social media, we can\ndraw no conclusions about whether this means they care or do not care\nabout privacy because they may consider it appropriate to share the\ninformation in question with friends, though not with advertisers etc.\n(2016: 217).\n\nHargittai and Marwick, on the other hand, interpret the privacy\nparadox differently and argue that while young adults are aware of the\ndangers of sharing information online, they feel that they have to\n\u201cacknowledge that individuals exist in social contexts where\nothers can and do violate their privacy\u201d (2016: 3737). Hoffman,\nLutz, and Ranzini (2016), in contrast, explain the endless sharing of\npersonal data, while simultaneously defending the value of\ninformational privacy, as a kind of \u201cprivacy cynicism\u201d. In\ncontrast, Draper and Turow analyze this attitude as\n\u201cresignation\u201d and have recently defended a theoretical\nframework which conceptualizes \u201cdigital resignation as a\nrational response to consumer surveillance\u201d (Draper & Turow\n2019: 1824).\n4.7.5 The Datafication of Life: The Quantified Self and the Duty to Protect One\u2019s Own Privacy\n\nOne aspect of mass data collection concerns the possibility of\nself-observation: one\u2019s own behavior can be measured\ncomprehensively, and every quantifiable detail can be noted. The first\nsuch \u201clifeloggers\u201d were Gordon Bell and Jim Gemmell. They\nhad a grand vision of recording life as a whole, similar to the\nprotagonists in Dave Eggers\u2019 dystopian novel The Circle\n(Bell & Gemmell 2009 [2010]; see Eggers 2013 and his 2021; Lanzing\n2016). As a rule, self-trackers use self-observation techniques more\nselectively. They are mostly concerned with data that is necessary for\ntheir health and well-being, but not with all-round\nself-observation.\n\nAllen points to one of the consequences of living with a life log: she\nargues that life logs make memory superfluous and calls this activity\na \u201cfreezing of the past\u201d (Allen 2008: 48). This makes it\nimpossible to change oneself. She further argues that this complete\nabandonment of privacy\u2014also characteristic of social\nmedia\u2014leads to people, especially young adults, becoming less\nautonomous. Allen therefore pleads for a duty to protect our own\nprivacy (Allen 2011) and makes the case that protecting one\u2019s\nown privacy should be required:\n\n\nWe need to restrain choice\u2014if not by law, then somehow. Respect\nfor privacy rights and the ascription of privacy duties must both be a\npart of a society\u2019s formative project for shaping\ncitizens\u2026 some privacy should not be optional, waivable, or\nalienable. (Allen 2011: 172)\n\n4.8 The Privacy of Animals\n\nAlan Westin (1967) surveyed several studies of animals, demonstrating\nthat a desire for privacy is not restricted to humans. One of the more\nrecent contemporary debates on privacy concerns the question of\nwhether animals should have (a right to) privacy. Pepper (2020)\ndefends such a right, since nonhuman animals also have an\n\n\ninterest in shaping different kinds of relationships with one another\nby giving us control over how we present ourselves to others\u2026\nwhich grounds a right against us. (2020: 628; see also Paci et al.\n2022)\n\n4.9 Epistemological Issues\n\nResearch on the relationship between privacy and knowledge\u2014that\nis, on epistemological issues\u2014is a relative newcomer to the\narena of privacy debates. Fallis (2013) offers one of the first\ndiscussions of the issue, and criticizes the position that holds that\n\u201cprotecting privacy typically leads to less knowledge\nbeing acquired\u201d, as well as the position that \u201clack of\nknowledge is definitive of having privacy\u201d. He goes on\nto argue that\n\n\ncontra the defenders of the knowledge account of privacy,\nthat someone knowing something is not necessary for someone\nelse losing privacy about that thing. (Fallis 2013: 153)\n\n\nFor Kappel, it\n\n\nseems obvious that informational privacy has an epistemological\ncomponent; privacy or lack of privacy concerns certain kinds of\nepistemic relations between a cogniser and sensitive pieces of\ninformation. (2013: 179)\n\n\nIn his paper, Kappel aims at\n\n\n[shedding] some light on the epistemological component of\ninformational privacy [since] the nature of this epistemological\ncomponent of privacy is only sparsely discussed. (2013: 179; see also\nthe entry on\n privacy and information technology)\n\n4.10 Privacy, Surveillance, and Power\n\nSince the publication of the essay by Warren and Brandeis, there have\nbeen enormous technological advances that have radically transformed\nnot only the possibilities for keeping people under surveillance, but\nalso our concepts of privacy, as well as freedom and autonomy.\nOpportunities for monitoring people are now available in private\nhouseholds, public spaces, and when surfing the Internet. The spaces\nof freedom in the public sphere could not exist under\npermanent (potential) surveillance and social control, and certainly\nnot if we can no longer be sure about what data being collected, and\ninto whose hands it might fall (see Julie Cohen 2008 for more on the\nrelationship between privacy and visibility in the networked\ninformation age). If we can no longer be certain that we are not being\nsurveilled and controlled, then we cannot even openly and\nself-determinedly debate potentially critical positions with\nothers (Stahl 2016: 33\u201339; Rosen 2000: 207). Control and\nstandardization (or normalization) are two sides of the same coin. In\nthe face of increasingly pervasive data collection and digital\nsurveillance, some authors have sought to move away from\nunderstandings of privacy that build on the notions of control over\ninformation or secrecy. Brunton and Nissenbaum, for instance, have\nobserved a variety of practices that sought privacy through\n\u201cobfuscation\u201d, i.e., the \u201cdeliberate addition of\nambiguous, confusing, or misleading information to interfere with\nsurveillance and data collection\u201d (2015: 1). The German\nsociologist Carsten Ochs suggests that these obfuscation practices\ncorrespond to a new type of informational privacy, which emerges in\nresponse to the specific challenges of a digitalized society and which\nhe characterizes as \u201cconcealment\u201d\n(\u201cVerschleierung\u201d) (2022: 496).\n\nBrunton and Nissenbaum argue that obfuscation is a\n\n\ntool particularly suited to the \u201cweak\u201d\u2014the\nsituationally disadvantaged, those at the wrong end of asymmetrical\npower relationships. (2015: 9)\n\n It is useful to address the information asymmetry between those\nwho collect data and can use it to monitor, predict and influence\nbehaviors, and those whose data is collected and who may not even be\naware of this data collection and usage (Brunton & Nissenbaum\n2015: 48\u201351). These observations point to the relation between\nprivacy and power, which has received significant attention in the\nrecent literature. The erosion of privacy through data collection and\nprocessing increases the power of big technology companies and\ngovernments to influence the people whose data is collected\n(V\u00e9liz 2020).  Privacy is also a matter of power, insofar as\naccess to privacy is unequally distributed and marginalized groups are\nmore vulnerable than others to privacy invasions. The legal theorist\nSkinner-Thompson (2021) has documented how minority communities, such\nas religious, ethnic or sexual minorities, are disproportionally\nexposed to surveillance due to a lack of legal protections of\nprivacy.\n\nHere, we would also like to draw attention to the computer\nintelligence consultant Edward Snowden, an employee at the NSA, who in\n2013 published highly classified data from the NSA where he was\nworking. These data revealed global surveillance programs by different\nstates and the disclosure prompted many heated cultural debates in\ndifferent countries, as well as international academic debates. From\nthe beginning, one of the questions was whether Snowden had actually\nviolated the privacy of individuals or whether the publication of\nstate secrets should be judged differently than the\npublication of individual secrets; see Mokrosinska on the difference\nbetween secrecy and privacy (Mokrosinska 2020). On the general privacy\nissues involved in this affair, see Greenwald 2014; Rubel 2015;\nMacNish 2018; Lucas 2014. For the general societal debates, the\nSnowden revelations were significant in drawing new attention to\nstructural forms of surveillance and possible violations of\nprivacy.\n\nIn analyses of the new \u201csurveillance state\u201d, many authors\ndiscuss the different social contexts in which violations of\ninformational privacy may in various ways coincide with restrictions\nof freedom. Zuboff (2019) analyses and criticizes the surveillance\ncapitalism and the \u201cinstrumentarian power\u201d of this\nsurveillance state, where privacy is only seen as data and therefore\nas a tradable good. At the same time, she criticizes the process of\ntransforming personal life into behavioral data and commercial\nproducts. For Zuboff, personal data is not a commodity that should be\ntraded arbitrarily, since it is essentially constituted by human\nexperience (see also Roessler 2015; Wang 2022). Susskind\u2019s\ndiscussion of \u201cfuture power\u201d as the power to\n\u201cscrutiny\u201d and to \u201cperception-control\u201d (2018)\nis equally critical and pessimistic about the protection of\ninformational privacy in the surveillance state. Similar pessimism is\nexpressed by Harcourt (2015), who conceptualizes the decline and loss\nof privacy as the loss of the individual. At the same time, he calls\nfor forms of civil disobedience in the surveillance state (2015). For\nthe political abuse of data power, see Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison\n(2018) on the so-called Cambridge-Analytica Scandal.\n\nSpecific aspects of the surveillance state are highlighted by authors\nusing the concept of data colonialism, which brings out the persistent\nexploitative power inherent in datafication (Wang 2022). The term\n\u201ccolonialism\u201d is connected to cruel practices of\ndomination and exploitation in human history. As Couldry and Mejias\n(2019) emphasize, \u201cdata colonialism\u201d is not used to\ndescribe the physical violence and force that was often seen in\nhistorical colonialism, but at the same time, the frame of colonialism\nis not used \u201cas a mere metaphor\u201d either. Instead, the term\nis used \u201cto refer a new form of colonialism distinctive of the\ntwenty-first century\u201d (2019: 337), which involves a widespread\ndispossession and exploitation of our human lives. By using the term\n\u201cdata colonialism\u201d instead of \u201cdata\ncapitalism\u201d, or some similar formulation, the crueler side of\n\u201ctoday\u2019s exposure of daily life to capitalist forces of\ndatafication\u201d is highlighted (2019: 337; see also Thatcher,\nO\u2019Sullivan, & Mahmoudi 2016: 994).\n4.11 Privacy, Colonialism, and Racism\n\nMore specifically, racist structures and colonial heritage play a\nconstitutive role in the conceptualization of privacy. Fraser (1992)\nanalyzed the simultaneous constitution of privacy and the public\nsphere, in a cogent interpretation of the hearings for the\nconfirmation of Clarence Hill to the US Supreme Court. Race, sex and\nclass were the determinants of the construction of privacy:\n\n\nThe way the struggle unfolded, moreover, depended at every point on\nwho had the power to successfully and authoritatively define where the\nline between the public and the private would be drawn. It depended as\nwell on who had the power to police and defend that boundary. (Fraser\n1992: 595)\n\n\nNagel (1998a and b), meanwhile, is critical of this theory of\ninterdependence of the concepts privacy and the public sphere, but the\nidea that personal privacy is deeply connected with societal and\npolitical power relations plays an important role in the literature\nfrom the last decade. There has been intensified research on the\nracist and colonial constructions of privacy. Couldry and Mejias\n(2019) generally criticize the relation between big data and the\ncontemporary subject, while Arora (2019) argues more specifically that\nthat many assumptions about internet use in developing countries are\nwrong, since they presuppose a Western conception of this use and the\nidea of privacy in talking about and dealing with the Global South. In\nher work, she analyses the real-life patterns of internet use in\ndifferent countries (among them India and China) and seeks to answer\nquestions why, for instance, citizens of states with strict\nsurveillance policies seem to care so little about their digital\nprivacy (Arora 2019: 717).\n\nTranslating human life into commodified data relations is not new, but\nrather a fact that has been critically examined by many scholars over\nthe years. For example, Shoshana Zuboff (2019) has commented on the\ndrive toward continually increasing data extraction as the essence of\nsurveillance capitalism. From a different angle, Simone Browne\ninterprets the \u201ccondition of blackness\u201d as the key with\nthe help of which state surveillance can precisely record and regulate\nthe lives of subjects. Her book shows exactly how state surveillance\nemerged and learned from practices of colonial exploitation and\nslavery. Surveillance, Browne asserts,\n\n\nis both a discursive and material practice that reifies boundaries,\nborders, and bodies around racial lines, so much so that the\nsurveillance of blackness has long been, and continues to be, a social\nand political norm. (2015: 1)\n\n\nAgain, from the societal perspective of class and race, Bridges (2017)\ndemonstrates in which ways the protection of personal privacy is\ndeeply connected to class and race, and how it can be used to\nexacerbate the structures of social inequality. She points out that\nthe poor are subject to invasions of privacy that can be perceived as\ngross demonstrations of governmental power without limits.\n4.12 The Future of Privacy\n\nOver the last years, discussions have begun regarding the question of\nwhat lies \u201cbeyond privacy\u201d. Since most big technology\ncompanies have been forced to conform to privacy laws, and even\nadvertise their compliance, a significant question is whether a sort\nof \u201cprivacy-washing\u201d is occurring, where the very focus on\nprivacy undermines the interests which originally initiated those\nprivacy concerns. Projects like \u201cThe Privacy Sandbox\u201d,\nwhere Google, together with the advertisement-technology industry,\ndeveloped seemingly privacy-friendly alternatives to third-party\ncookies, may be seen as cases of \u201cprivacy-washing\u201d. Behind\nthese supposedly good intentions lie fundamental questions about the\nfuture of privacy, as well as the future of the internet. For example,\ndo we even want an internet that runs on personalized advertisements\nand massive data collection? Brunton and Nissenbaum are concerned\nthat\n\n\ninformation collection takes place in asymmetrical power\nrelationships: we rarely have choice as to whether or not we are\nmonitored, what is done with any information that is gathered, or what\nis done to us on the basis of conclusions drawn from that information.\n(2015: 49)\n\n\nSharon demonstrates that\n\n\nin an interesting twist, the tech giants came to be portrayed as\ngreater champions of privacy than some democratic governments. (2021:\n45)\n\n\nThus, if we look back to the beginnings of informational privacy in\nthe late nineteenth century, we can see that the apparent changes (the\ncorporations themselves seem to care about privacy) express the very\ncontinuities of the threat to privacy. The academic and societal\ndebates about these threats, however, make it clear that privacy has\nby no means lost its value and importance.",
