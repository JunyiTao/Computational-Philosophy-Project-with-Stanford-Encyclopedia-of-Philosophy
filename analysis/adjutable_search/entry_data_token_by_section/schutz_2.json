Hence, he\nacknowledged that his work is \u201cin conflict with its\nmaterial\u201d since it \u201cis forced to resort to conceptual\nformulations\u201d (Schutz 1982, 70). This problem parallels the\nproblem of reaching the life-form of the present unfolding of\nexperience (duration) since one can only speak of it by arresting its\nflow, distinguishing its moments, and thus remembering what has\nlapsed\u2014but then one is in the new life-form of memory. Although\nthis gap between present duration and memory prompted his turn to\nHusserlian phenomenology, the problematic itself highlighted for him\nthe pervasiveness and hiddenness of interpretive activity as one moves\nbetween interpretive frameworks\u2014a principal theme of all his\nlater work. He took notice of this theme when he frequently pointed\nout how one\u2019s reconstitution of a past experience in memory\nvaried according to the interests of the present from which\none remembered the past. Indeed a favorite example from\nBergson\u2019s work involved an actor reflecting upon a prior process\nof choosing and interpreting it as if it had been a choice between two\nclearly defined possibilities, whereas in fact the process often\noscillated between several options, retaining, reproducing, comparing,\nand modifying them in succession. In general, Schutz concurred with\nBergson on such notions such as attention to life, planes of\nconsciousness, the body as the intersection of outer and inner\ntemporality, music as the model of duration, and multiple types of\nordering, but rejected his bio-evolutionary theory, vitalism, and the\nidea of a supra-personal el\u00e1n.\n",
