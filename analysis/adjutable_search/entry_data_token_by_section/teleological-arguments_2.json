    "main_text": "Design Inference Patterns || Analogical Design Arguments: Schema 1\n2.1 Analogical Design Arguments: Schema 1\n\nDesign arguments are routinely classed as analogical\narguments\u2014various parallels between human artifacts and certain\nnatural entities being taken as supporting parallel conclusions\nconcerning operative causation in each case. The standardly ascribed\nschema is roughly thus:\n\n\nSchema 1:\n\nEntity e within nature (or the cosmos, or nature itself)\nis like specified human artifact a (e.g., a machine)\nin relevant respects R.\na has R precisely because it is a\nproduct of deliberate design by intelligent human agency.\nLike effects typically have like causes (or\nlike explanations, like existence requirements,\netc.)\n\n\nTherefore\n\nIt is (highly) probable that e has R precisely\nbecause it too is a product of deliberate design by intelligent,\nrelevantly human-like agency.\n\n\n2.1.1 Humean objections\n\nThis general argument form was criticized quite vigorously by Hume, at\nseveral key steps. Against (1), Hume argued that the analogy is not\nvery good\u2014that nature and the various things in it are not\nvery like human artifacts and exhibit substantial differences\nfrom them\u2014e.g., living vs. not, self-sustaining vs. not. Indeed,\nwhereas advocates of design arguments frequently cited similarities\nbetween the cosmos on the one hand and human machines on the other,\nHume suggested that the cosmos much more closely resembled a living\norganism than a machine. (Contemporary cosmology strengthens\nHume\u2019s point, given the radical changes that have taken place\nsince the Big Bang. The universe looks less stable and\n\u201cmachine-like\u201d than when the design argument was at the\nheight of its popularity.) But if the alleged resemblance is in\nrelevant respects distant, then the inference in question will be\nlogically fragile. And while (2) may be true in specific cases of\nhuman artifacts a, that fact is only made relevant to natural\nphenomena e via (3), which underpins the transfer of the key\nattribution. Against (3), Hume argued that any number of alternative\npossible explanations could be given of allegedly designed entities in\nnature\u2014chance, for instance. Thus, even were (1) true\nand even were there important resemblances, the argument might confer\nlittle probabilistic force onto the conclusion.\n\nMore generally, Hume also argued that even if something like the\nstated conclusion (4) were established, that left the arguer far from\nanything like a traditional conception of God. For instance, natural\nevils or apparently suboptimal designs might suggest e.g., an amateur\ndesigner or a committee of designers. And if phenomena instrumental to\nthe production of natural evils (e.g., disease microorganisms)\nexhibited various of the Rs, then they would presumably have\nto be laid at the designer\u2019s door, further eroding the\ndesigner\u2019s resemblance to the wholly good deity of tradition.\nAnd even the most impressive empirical data could properly establish\nonly finite (although perhaps enormous) power and wisdom, rather than\nthe infinite power and wisdom usually associated with divinity. But\neven were one to concede some substance to the design argument\u2019s\nconclusion, that would, Hume suggested, merely set up a regress. The\ndesigning agent would itself demand explanation, requiring ultimately\na sequence of prior analogous intelligences producing intelligences.\nAnd even were the existence of a designer of material things\nestablished, that did not yet automatically establish the existence of\na creator of the matter so shaped. And since analogical\narguments are a type of induction (see the entry on\n analogy and analogical reasoning),\n the conclusion even if established would be established only to some,\nperhaps insignificant, degree of probability. Furthermore, we could\nnot ground any induction concerning the cosmos itself upon a requisite\nfund of experiences of other cosmoi found to be both deliberately\ndesigned and very like ours in relevant respects\u2014for\nthe simple reason that this universe is our only sample. And finally\nthe fraction of this one cosmos (both spatially and temporally)\navailable to our inspection is extraordinarily small\u2014not a\npromising basis for a cosmically general conclusion. Hume concluded\nthat while the argument might constitute some limited grounds for\nthinking that \u201cthe cause or causes of order in the universe\nprobably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence\u201d\n(1779 [1998], 88) Hume\u2019s emphasis)\u2014and that is not a\ntrivial implication\u2014it established nothing else whatever.\n\nHistorically, not everyone agreed that Hume had fatally damaged the\nargument. It is simply not true that explanatory inferences cannot\nproperly extend beyond merely what is required for known effects. As a\nvery general example, based on the few observations which humans had\nmade during a cosmically brief period in a spatially tiny part of the\ncosmos, Newton theorized that all bits of matter at\nall times and in all places attracted all\nother bits of matter. There was nothing logically suspect here.\nIndeed, simplicity and uniformity considerations\u2014which have\nconsiderable well-earned scientific clout\u2014push in the direction\nof such generalizations.\n\nBut Hume certainly identified important places within the argument to\nprobe. Whether his suggestions are correct concerning the uncertain\ncharacter of any designer inferred will depend upon the specific\nRs and upon what can or cannot be definitively said\nconcerning requirements for their production.\n2.1.2 R Concerns: Round 1\n\nKey questions, then, include: what are the relevant Rs\ntypically cited? do those Rs genuinely signal purpose and\ndesign? how does one show that either way? are there viable\nalternative accounts of the Rs requiring no reference to\nminds? how does one show that either way? The specific\nRs in question are obviously central to design argument\nefforts. Although the underlying general category is, again, some\nspecial type of orderliness, the specifics have ranged rather widely\nhistorically. Among the more straightforwardly empirical are inter\nalia uniformity, contrivance, adjustment of means to ends,\nparticularly exquisite complexity, particular types of functionality,\ndelicacy, integration of natural laws, improbability, and the fitness\n(fine-tuning) of the inorganic realm for supporting life. Several\nproblematic proposals that are empirically further removed and have\naxiological overtones have also been advanced, including the\nintelligibility of nature, the directionality of evolutionary\nprocesses, aesthetic characteristics (beauty, elegance, and the like),\napparent purpose and value (including the aptness of our world for the\nexistence of moral value and practice) and just the sheer niftiness of\nmany of the things we find in nature.\n",
