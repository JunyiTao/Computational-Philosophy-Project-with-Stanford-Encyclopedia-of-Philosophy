    "main_text": "Physics\n5. Physics\n\nAfter mathematics comes physics. We have only a few Farabian texts\ndealing with physics taken in the broadest sense and covering the\nwhole of natural philosophy. Paul Lettinck addresses some of\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s views on physics in his\nAristotle\u2019s Physics and its Reception in the Arabic\nWorld (1994) and Janos (2012) also does so. Marwan Rashed (2008)\nattempted a reconstruction of a lost treatise on changing beings.\n\nAl-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee wrote a little treatise rejecting the\nexistence of the vacuum by means of an experiment. Necati Lugal & Aydin Sayili (1951)\npublished the Arabic with an English translation.\n\nThe substantive Refutation of Galen\u2019s Critique of\nAristotle\u2019s Views on Human Organs merits serious studies.\n\u2018Abdurrahman Badawi edited it in his Trait\u00e9s\nphilosophiques (1983: 38\u2013107). It shows\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s interest in Aristotle\u2019s\nzoological works and develops interesting parallels between the\nhierarchical structure of the organs of the human body, that of\ncosmology, that of emanation, and that of the ideal state. Badr El-Fakkak (2017) explains these parallels and Jawdath Jadour (2018) studies the structure of this text, which remains untranslated, and presents a new edition of al-Farabi\u2019s Epistle on medicine. \n\nPhysics includes Aristotle\u2019s On the soul and scholars\nhave paid much attention to al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s little\ntreatise On intellect (ed. by M. Bouyges, 1983). A full\nEnglish translation of this important treatise, of which there exist\ntwo Medieval Latin versions, was finally given by McGinnis &\nReisman in their Classical Arabic Philosophy (2007:\n68\u201378). Philippe Vallat published an extensive study of al-Farabi\u2019s views on the intellect (2019a). The issue of the soul and the intellect is linked to logic, ethics, cosmology, and metaphysics. It also gives rise to a\ndebate. Earlier scholars considered that for\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee universals are acquired by emanation from\nthe Agent Intellect, which for him is the tenth and last Intelligence,\neven if in many passages the second master uses the language of\nabstraction. Recently, Richard Taylor (2006 & 2010) argued that,\non the contrary, there is genuine abstraction in\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, even if in some ways it involves the\nemanative power of the Agent Intellect.\n",
