    "main_text": "The Metaphysical Disputations || The Causes of Being\n2.2 The Causes of Being\n\nSu\u00e1rez devotes a great deal of energy to an investigation of\ntopics pertaining to causation, broadly construed. This is because he\nis interested in the first instance, as a metaphysician, in an\ninvestigation into the causes of being (DM XII\u2013XXVII),\nan approach to metaphysics colored by the writings of Aristotle, the\nbroad idiom of which Su\u00e1rez, in common with other scholastics,\nembraces. More specifically, first, in keeping with the Aristotelian\nconception of science (scientia), Su\u00e1rez supposes that\nto understand anything we must grasp and understand the causes of that\nthing; so, as a special case, to understand being (ens) we\nmust investigate and understand the causes of being, taken in its most\ngeneral and abstract aspect. Second, as he conceives it, causal\ninquiry proceeds within the context of an Aristotelian four-causal\nframework of explanatory adequacy: material, formal, efficient, and\nfinal. Su\u00e1rez supposes, however, that to execute his study of\nthe causes of being, it is first of all incumbent on him to understand\nprecisely what it is for something to be a cause, but then\nalso further, as a distinct matter, what it is for a cause to\nexercise its causality.\n\nAs Su\u00e1rez approaches these issues, the question of\nwhat a cause is differs crucially from the question of\nhow a cause actively brings about its effects\u2014two\nquestions which were often run together in later periods of\nphilosophy. According to Su\u00e1rez, one might truly say, for\ninstance, that a doctor is a cause of health, without yet\nunderstanding the precise activity of the doctor in virtue of which he\nis a cause, how it is that his activity on a specific occasion\nqualifies as an instance of healing\u2014how, that is, the cause\nexercises its causality (DM XII 2.13). To have a full\nunderstanding of the science of medicine, then, one must understand\nthe causes of health and, further, how those causes exercise their\ncausality, that is, how those causes manage to have the effects they\nhave. So too, then, with the causes of being. To understand being, we\nmust understand what brings being about, in the broadest possible\nsense\u2014what is responsible for being (ens). Thereafter,\nwe must come to terms with what causes individual beings\n(entia) to come into existence, or to change their manner of\nexistence once they have come into existence. This involves reflection\non all the causes of being, however many and of whatever kinds they\nmay be. It further involves reflection on the narrower question of how\nthe causes of being exercise their causality\u2014how precisely, that\nis, such causes come to be responsible for being. This, then,\nlicenses, or indeed requires, Su\u00e1rez to engage in a thorough\nexamination of causation itself.\n\nThe fifteen disputations in which Su\u00e1rez explores these matters\n(DM XII\u2013XXVII) consequently contain extended, intricate\ndiscussions of each of the four causes, as well as detailed\nexplorations of how each cause effects its causality on a specific\noccasion. In general, he urges, a cause is a sort of origin or source\n(a principium). But what sort of source or origin? Not every\nsource or origin qualifies as a cause (a journey from Athens to\nJerusalem begins in Athens, but Athens is not the cause of this\njourney). Su\u00e1rez notes that certain of his contemporaries\nsought to characterize the relevant sort of principle simply as that\non which other things depend as such (DM XII 2.4: causa\nest id a quo aliquid per se\n pendet);[12]\n but he sets aside this formulation in favor of one which, if\ninitially odder sounding, is more contentful and characteristic of the\nidiom within which he works. He thinks that a cause is the sort of\nprinciple that \u201cin its own right imparts being to something\nelse\u201d (causa est principium per se influens esse in\naliud: DM XII 2.4). One reason his approach sounds odd\nis that talk of one thing's \u201cimparting being\u201d, or perhaps\neven of one thing's \u201cflowing being into\u201d (influens\nesse) another thing, is initially hard to fathom. This fact does\nnot escape Su\u00e1rez, however. Indeed, he calls attention to this\nvery word \u201cflowing\u201d (influens) and glosses it\nsimply as \u201cgiving\u201d or \u201ccommunicating\u201d being to\nanother thing (dandi vel communicandi esse alteri). So at the\nmost general level, a cause is the sort of principle or source which\ncan impart being to another being\u2014that is to say, then, that a\ncause is something that makes something exist or makes something\nalready existing come to exist in a new and different way.\n\nOf course, this generic formulation by itself tells us very little,\nbut that too is by design. On the overarching approach favored by\nSu\u00e1rez, causation is initially very broadly characterized: a\ncause, taken most generically, is responsible for the existence or\nfeatures of some being beyond itself; and an exercise of causality is\nprecisely the activity by which a cause imparts existence to another,\nby creating it, or altering its features once it exists. As he moves\nthrough each of the four ways one thing might be responsible for the\nexistence or features of another, Su\u00e1rez brings content and\nspecificity to his first generic notion, by explicating the various\nways each of four causes manages to impart being to some being beyond\nitself.\n\nIn fact, this general approach to causation encourages Su\u00e1rez\nto treat the subject so broadly that, for instance, he devotes an\nentire disputation (DM XIX, of some 39,000 words), one of the\nsix disputations given over to efficient causation (DM\nXVII\u2013XXII), to the topics of necessity and contingency, fate and\nluck, freedom of the will, and issues pertaining to God's freedom in\ncreation. He even indulges in this disputation on efficient causation\nin a discussion of the question of whether there could be contingency\nin the world if\u2014(in his view) contrary to modal fact\u2014God\nwere necessitated to create the world as it is. This discussion offers\na good example of the richly metaphysical character of Su\u00e1rez's\ngeneral philosophical outlook: he very often engages not only in\ncounterfactual reasoning, but in counterfactual reasoning featuring\ncounterfactuals with impossible antecedents. Such reasoning permits\nhim to make fine-grained, highly intensional discriminations that\nwould otherwise be inaccessible to him. Thus, with respect to the\ncurrent illustration, he concludes that there could indeed be\ncontingency in the world if it were the case that God, per\nimpossibile, was necessitated to create the world just as we find\nit. This finding, whether or not ultimately defensible, then permits\nhim to make further, finer-grained distinctions among different types\nof contingency, and so also among different types of modality:\nphysical, nomic, and logical.\n\nWhen focusing on the nature of the individual causes seriatim,\nSu\u00e1rez begins by dividing the four causes into the\ninternal and external (or intrinsic and extrinsic;\nDM XII 3.19). Formal and material causes are internal,\nwhereas efficient and final causes are external. A thing's matter\naccounts for the material features of the thing which it constitutes,\nwithout actually being that thing; and the same again for the\nform. So, for example, a statue is malleable because it is made of\nbronze, though that quantity of bronze in virtue of which it is\nmalleable is not identical with the statue, since it may exist when\nthe statue does not; and the bronze statue is a statue of Hermes\nbecause of its form, which, like its matter, can be readily thought of\nas a constituent of the statue without being identified with the\nstatue, which is itself neither exhaustively matter nor form, but a\ncomposite of both. In Su\u00e1rez's terms, then, matter and form\nconform to the general definition of a cause, because each in its own\nway infuses something beyond itself\u2014the statue\u2014with its\nexistence and features. Each manages to give some manner of being\n(esse) to the statue, even they are in different ways\ninternal to the entity whose being they influence. By contrast,\nneither of the statue's external causes\u2014the efficient cause,\nthat is, the sculptor who sculpts the bronze so as to give it this or\nthat form, and its final cause, that is, the goal or reason the\nsculptor has in view when sculpting\u2014is a constituent of the\nstatue. They are thus external causes in Su\u00e1rez's terminology.\n\n\nWithin this overarching framework, Su\u00e1rez proceeds to\ninvestigate each of the four causes minutely. One immediately\nappreciates when studying his treatment of these issues a level of\ndetail and sophistication plainly lacking in many of the accounts of\ncausation written in the several centuries after his death. It is\ndifficult to believe, for example, that Hume's modest and cursory\nsuggestion, in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding,\nthat a cause is \u201can object, followed by another, and where all\nthe objects similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to\nthe second\u201d (Hume 1993 [1748], II.7) is an advance in nuance or\nsophistication over Su\u00e1rez's the protracted discussions of the\nMetaphysical Disputations.\n\nHowever that may be, one is confronted in this work with a discussion\nwhich is by any measure rich, intricate, and comprehensive. Each of\nthe four causes receives it own extended treatment in the sections of\nthe Metaphysical Disputations dedicated to the causes of\nbeing (DM XII\u2013XXVII). To come to see the character of\nthese discussions, we may reflect especially on Suarez's presentation\nof two of the four causes in particular, one internal and one\nexternal. His treatments of formal and final causes are in any case of\nspecial note, since each in its own way represents a departure and\ndevelopment from the very Aristotelian tradition which forms the basic\nfoundation for Su\u00e1rez's metaphysics.\n",
