    "main_text": "\n\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric has had an unparalleled influence\non the development of the art of rhetoric. In addition to\nAristotle\u2019s disciples and followers, the so-called Peripatetic\nphilosophers (see Fortenbaugh/Mirhady 1994), famous Roman teachers of\nrhetoric, such as Cicero and Quintilian, frequently used elements\nstemming from Aristotle\u2019s rhetorical theory. These latter\nauthors, however, were not primarily interested in a meticulous\ninterpretation of Aristotle\u2019s writings, but were rather looking\nfor a conceptual framework for their own manuals of rhetoric. This is\none of the reasons why for two millennia the interpretation of\nAristotelian rhetoric has been pursued by those concerned primarily with\nthe history of rhetoric rather than philosophy. This association with\nthe rhetorical rather than with the philosophical tradition is also\nmirrored in the fact that in the most influential manuscripts and\neditions, the text of Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric (for its\ntransmission see Kassel 1971) was surrounded by rhetorical works and\nspeeches written by other Greek and Latin authors, and was thus seldom\ninterpreted in the context of Aristotle\u2019s philosophical works.\nIt was not until the last few decades that the philosophically salient\nfeatures of the Aristotelian rhetoric have been acknowledged (e.g. in\nthe collections Furley/Nehamas 1994 and Rorty 1996; for a more general\nsurvey of scholarship in the 20th century see Natali 1994). Most\nnotably, scholars became aware of the fact that Aristotle\u2019s\nrhetorical analysis of persuasion draws on many concepts and ideas\nthat are also treated in his logical, ethical, political and\npsychological writings, so that the Rhetoric became\nincreasingly perceived as well-integrated part of the Aristotelian\noeuvre. For example, Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric is\ninextricably connected with the history of ancient logic (see Allen\n2008 and, more generally,\n ancient logic)\n and is often taken as an important inspiration for modern\nargumentation theory (see van Eemeren 2013 and, more generally,\n dialogical logic).\n Some authors have stressed the Rhetoric\u2019s affinity to\nAristotle\u2019s ethical theory (see e.g. Woerner 1990), while others\nwere attracted by Aristotle\u2019s rhetorical account of metaphor\n(see e.g. Ricoeur 1996 and, more generally,\n metaphor).\n Most significantly, philosophers and scholars began to turn their\nattention to the Rhetoric\u2019s account of the passions or\nemotions, which is not only richer than in any other Aristotelian\ntreatise, but was also seen as manifesting an early example of\ncognitive, judgement-based accounts of emotions (see e.g. Nussbaum\n1996, Konstan 2006 and, more generally, \u00a75 of\n emotion).\n",
