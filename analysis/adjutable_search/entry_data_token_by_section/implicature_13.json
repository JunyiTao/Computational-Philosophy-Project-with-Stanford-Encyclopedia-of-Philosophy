    "main_text": "Speaker Implicature and Intention\n14. Speaker Implicature and Intention\n\nW. Davis (2016: Ch. 2) describes ways of explaining and inferring\nconversational implicatures that do not rely on conversational\nprinciples. The methods he proposes for speaker implicature are\ndescribed in this section and for sentence implicature in the\nnext.\n\nFor a speaker to implicate something is for the speaker to mean\nsomething by saying something else\n (\u00a71).\n It is generally agreed that what a speaker means is determined by the\nspeaker\u2019s intentions. When Steve utters \u201cKathryn\nis a Russian teacher\u201d, whether Steve means that Kathryn is a\nteacher of Russian nationality or a teacher of the Russian language,\nand whether he is speaking literally or ironically, depends entirely\non what Steve intends to convey. What \u201cconvey\u201d means\nprecisely is controversial, but is an independent\n issue.[76]\n\nWe most commonly explain why people do A with the intention\nof doing B by explaining why they believe they will do\nB by doing A, or why they want to do B. We\ncan explain why speakers intend to convey a thought by uttering a\nsentence that says something else in the same ways. Why do speakers\nbelieve they can convey thoughts by means of the various figures and\nmodes of speech identified in\n \u00a74?\n One reason is that they have seen others doing so. Knowledge of the\ncommon forms of implicature is acquired along with knowledge of the\nsemantics and syntax of our native language. Speakers pick up figures\nand modes of speech from other speakers, as they learn vocabulary and\ngrammar. After speakers have become proficient, their own past success\nin using figures and modes of speech is a reason for them to believe\nthey will succeed again. Knowledge of both figures and modes is as\ntacit as our knowledge of syntax and semantics. It is not knowledge of\nfacts that define a language, but of how a language is used and\nunderstood. Since the figures and modes do not depend on a particular\nlanguage, they can be used with any language.\n\nWhy do speakers want to engage in implicature? The main reasons are\nthe reasons speakers make statements: to communicate, express\nthemselves, and record their thoughts. These goals may serve to\ncooperate with others, or to oppose them. What goals are served by\nimplicating rather than saying something? One is verbal efficiency\n(Levinson 2000: 28\u201331; Camp 2006: 3; Wilson & Sperber 2012:\n62): through implicature we express two or more thoughts by uttering\njust one sentence. Another is to mislead without lying (Horn 2010:\n\u00a74; 2017; Zufferey et al. 2019: 77\u201384). People often wish others\nto believe things that are false, and not only in situations of\nconflict and competition. And they nearly always prefer misleading to\n lying.[77]\n The greater deniability of implicature, and the fact that it enables\nus to veil our intentions, are often motivating factors (Brown &\nLevinson 1978: 137; Pinker 2007; Camp 2022). We observed in\n \u00a710\n how implicature promotes the goals of style and politeness.\n\nIt should also be recognized that people perform many even highly\nskilled actions automatically, spontaneously, or habitually. Such\nactions are done without deliberation or conscious planning. What\nspeakers implicate as well as what they say commonly falls in this\ncategory.\n\nGiven that speaker meaning is a matter of speaker intention, it\nfollows that speaker implicatures can be recognized or predicted by\nthe methods we use to infer intentions from behavior, including\nabduction, analogy, and testimony. In example\n (2),\n Carla may suspect that Don means the weather is bad because irony is\na common linguistic device\n (\u00a74),\n and Don has been ironic in similar situations before. Don\u2019s\nintonation may be a clue. On the other hand, if Don rarely speaks\nfiguratively when reporting in, Carla may infer that he meant what he\n said.[78]\n\nConversational principles can play the same indirect role in\nimplicature recognition that known tendencies or goals play in\ninductive inference generally. Since speakers commonly observe the\nCooperative Principle, and hearers know this in a vague and tacit sort\nof way, hearers tend to assume that particular speakers are\ncooperating, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. If the\nhypothesis that Barb means she is not going to Paul\u2019s party in\n example (1)\n fits better with the assumption that she is being cooperative than\nthe hypothesis that she is not answering the question, Alan may by\nabduction infer she is implicating that. Further support for the\nhypothesis may be provided by the recollection that other speakers\nhave implicated similar things in similar circumstances before. The\nfact that relevance implicature is a common practice thus provides\nanalogical evidence\n (\u00a74).\n Recognition of an unconventional form of implicature is more\ndifficult, but no harder than recognizing when a speaker is using a\nsentence with an unconventional meaning. As Sterelny (1982:\n192\u20133) observed, knowledge of the particular speaker is\nultimately more important than knowledge of non-universal\ngeneralizations.\n\nWhen S is being uncooperative, we have to use other\ngeneralizations or analogies. We are familiar with the ways defendants\nmanipulate language in an effort to avoid self-incrimination.\n",
