    "main_text": "Social Models of Knowers\n2. Social Models of Knowers\n\n\nOne of the major contributions of feminist social epistemologies has\nbeen their thorough critique of the individualism of modern\nepistemology, and their corresponding reconstructions of epistemic\nsubjects as situated knowers. Elizabeth Anderson argues that\nit is feminist epistemologies\u2019 investigation into \u201chow the social\nlocation of the knower affects what and how she knows\u201d that properly\nplace them within the realm of social epistemologies (Anderson 2011).\nAlong with other social epistemologists, feminists have found\nthemselves at least initially presenting their work as responses to a\ndominantly individualistic tradition. From the Cartesian beginnings of\nmodern epistemology where knowledge was thought to result from the\ncareful exercise of an individual\u2019s mental faculties, to the dominant\ncontemporary epistemological frameworks resting on \u201cS knows that\np\u201d formulations where \u201cS\u201d can be any epistemic\nsubject, feminist social epistemologists have drawn attention to the\ninadequacies of the abstract individualism prevalent in epistemology\n(Code 1991; Jaggar 1983; Scheman 1995). The problems, feminists have\nargued, lie not simply in the claim that knowers are primarily\nindividuals, but rather that these individual knowers are themselves\nconceptualized as generic (or interchangeable) and self-sufficient (or\ncapable of self-sufficiency) in knowing (Code 1991; Grasswick\n2004). The conjunction of these three features forms what has been\ncalled the\natomistic model of knowers. The model does not deny that\nknowers have identities and social locations, but it does deny that\nthese are relevant features to include in epistemic\nassessments. Though not a full-fledged solipsism, the atomistic view\nputs forth a methodological solipsism for epistemological purposes\n(Potter 1993), and is antithetical to social analyses of\nknowledge. For example, if one\u2019s epistemology begins with the\nassumption that all knowers are interchangeable, then any differences\nin individuals based on social location, including gender, will be\ndeemed epistemically irrelevant from the start. Similarly, if one\u2019s\nepistemology begins with the assumption that knowers are or can be\nself-sufficient, analyses will focus on the types of knowledge that\nmight be attainable in solitude, such as simple observational\nexpressions as \u201cThe cat is on the mat\u201d, ignoring more complex\nknowledge, such as \u201cthe economy is in a recession\u201d, or \u201cour society\nsuffers from patriarchy\u201d, and leaving out of the analysis the social\ninteractions that make many forms of knowledge\npossible.[9] Many\nfeminists have identified the prevalence of the atomistic model within\nepistemology as an obstacle to the development of an accurate\nunderstanding of the epistemic roles of gender and other features of\nidentity that track systematic power relations, arguing that\nalternative, more social models of knowers are necessary.\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, feminist attention to the identity of the\nepistemic subject abounded in such titles as Who Knows?\n(Nelson 1990), What Can She Know? (Code 1991) and Whose\nScience? Whose Knowledge? (Harding 1991). \u201cSituated knowers\u201d\nbecame a key term in feminist epistemologies, though theorists varied\nsignificantly on the specifics of the concept. Some focused on the\nsocially differentiated nature of knowers (in contrast to the generic\nnature of knowers in the atomistic model), while others focused on\ntheir social interactive nature (in contrast to the self-sufficiency\nof knowers in the atomistic model). Still others argued for the\nadoption of the community as primary knower (in contrast to the\nindividual as primary knower in the atomistic model). Many of these\narguments intersect with each other. For example, by emphasizing the\ndifferentiated nature of knowers one strengthens the argument for the\nepistemic interdependence of knowers; interaction between knowers\nbecomes crucial so that individuals can access knowledge beyond the\nreach of their specific social location. Since conceptions of knowers\ncarry normative weight, making distinctions between those who know and\nthose who don\u2019t, or between those who know more or less well, feminist\ndiscussions of situated knowers are very much integrated with their\ndiscussions of the objectivity and justification of knowledge claims\n(see Section 3:\n Social Models of Knowledge and Objectivity).\n",
