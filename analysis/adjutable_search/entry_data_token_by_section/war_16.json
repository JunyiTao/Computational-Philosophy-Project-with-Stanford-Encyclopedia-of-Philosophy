    "main_text": "Jus in Bello || Necessity\n5. The Future of Just War Theory\n\nMuch recent work has used either traditionalist or revisionist just\nwar theory to consider new developments in the practice of warfare,\nespecially the use of drones, and the possible development of\nautonomous weapons systems. Others have focused on the ethics of\nnon-state conflicts, and asymmetric wars. Very few contemporary wars\nfit the nation-state model of the mid-twentieth century, and conflicts\ninvolving non-state actors raise interesting questions for legitimate\nauthority and the principle of Discrimination in particular (Parry\n2016). A third development, provoked by the terrible failure to plan\nahead in Iraq and Afghanistan, is the wave of reflection on the\naftermath of war. This topic, jus post bellum, is addressed\nseparately.\n\nAs to the philosophical foundations of just war theory: the\ntraditionalist and revisionist positions are now well staked out. But\nthe really interesting questions that remain to be answered should be\napproached without thinking in terms of that split. Most notably, \npolitical philosophers may have something more to contribute\nto the just war theory debate. It would be interesting, too, to think\nwith a more open mind about the institutions of international law\n(nobody has yet vindicated the claim that the law of armed conflict\nhas authority, for example), and also about the role of the military\nwithin nation-states, outside of wartime (Ryan 2016).\n\nThe collective dimensions of warfare could be more fully\nexplored. Several philosophers have considered how soldiers \u201cact\ntogether\u201d when they fight (Zohar 1993; Kutz 2005; Bazargan\n2013). But few have reflected on whether group agency is present and\nmorally relevant in war. And yet it is superficially very natural to\ndiscuss wars in these terms, especially in evaluating the war as a\nwhole. When the British parliament debated in late 2015 whether to\njoin the war against ISIL in Syria and Iraq, undoubtedly each MP was\nthinking also about what she ought to do. But most of them\nwere asking themselves what the United Kingdom ought to\ndo. This group action might be wholly reducible to the individual\nactions of which it is composed. But this still raises interesting\nquestions: in particular, how should I justify my actions, as an\nindividual who is acting on behalf of the group? Must I appeal only to\nreasons that apply to me? Or can I act on reasons that apply to the\ngroup\u2019s other members or to the group as a whole? And can I\nassess the permissibility of my actions without assessing the group\naction of which they are part? Despite the prominence of collectivist\nthinking in war, discussion of war\u2019s group morality is very much\nin its infancy.\n",
