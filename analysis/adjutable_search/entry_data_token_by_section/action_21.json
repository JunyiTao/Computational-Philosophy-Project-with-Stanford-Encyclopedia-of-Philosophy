Right now, I am not competing in the\nOlympics, not writing poetry, not swimming in the English Channel, not\nflying over the moon, or taking a journey to the center of the earth.\nHowever, none of the things could be plausibly described as cases of\nomissions or refrainings; it would be odd if I were told that I was\nrefraining from competing in the Olympics or omitting to fly over the\nmoon. Philosophers often describe cases of omissions as cases of my\nfailing to do something that I was somehow \u201csupposed to\ndo\u201d (Bach 2010). Only some of my omissions are intentional or\neven voluntary: if my alarm does not go off and I miss my class\nbecause I overslept, I omitted to teach but not intentionally. On the\nother hand, if I fail to show up because I am protesting my\nuniversity\u2019s salary cuts, my omission was intentional.\nIntentional omissions and (intentional) refrainings are generally\ntaken to be the only possible candidates for being instances of agency\namong not-doings (see Vermazen 1985 for an expression of this idea).\nThus, we will focus on these cases. The categories of intentional\nomissions and refraining are not necessarily identical. If I refrain\nfrom striking my opponent in a fit of anger, it seems wrong to say\nthat I omitted to strike her as there is no sense in which I was\n\u201csupposed to\u201d strike my opponent.\n",
