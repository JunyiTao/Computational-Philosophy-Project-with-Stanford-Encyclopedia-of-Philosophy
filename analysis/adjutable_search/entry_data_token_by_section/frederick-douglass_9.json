    "main_text": "Leadership\n10. Leadership\n\nDouglass was a leader among the Americans involved in the abolition\nmovement, and after the Civil War, although unelected into any office,\nhe remained a leading voice for black\n Americans.[24]\n Garrison presented Douglass as a victim of and witness to slavery and\nas a spokesperson for Garrisonian abolitionism, but he freed himself\nfrom their restraints, just as he freed himself from slavery. To speak\nfor himself, be his own man, and be a leader among men. That is what\nDouglass wanted. Thus, he shaped his own story, insisted on speaking\nhis mind free from the control of handlers like Garrison, and strove\nto represent the interests of black Americans.\n\nHis example of leadership was quick to be seized and claimed by other\nprospective black leaders and spokespersons. The most significant\nexample of this was the conflicting claim between W.E.B. Du Bois and\nBooker T. Washington (1856\u20131915) over Douglass\u2019s legacy.\nBoth men competed for the opportunity to publish a biography of\nDouglass with the publishers George W. Jacobs & Company in their\nseries The American Crisis Biographies (Sundstrom 2008:\n11\u201335). The press rejected Du Bois\u2019s bid for this task in\nfavor of Washington\u2019s (1907) and granted Du Bois the project of\nwriting a biography of John Brown instead\u2014but he included within\nit an extensive discussion on Douglass (Du Bois 1909).\n\nAfter the death of Douglass, Du Bois penned an unpublished\nelegiac poem, \u201cThe Passing of Douglass\u201d (Du Bois 1999:\nix), and he incorporated elements of Douglass\u2019s narrative in\nThe Souls of Black Folk (1903 [1999: xxii]), John\nBrown (1909), and Black Reconstruction in America (1935\n[2021]). Du Bois presented Douglass as a self-assertive freedom\nfighter and a leader of an activist community that demanded full\nsocial and political liberty, equality, and inclusion. Du Bois\u2019s\nDouglass was not an accommodationist: He was not the sort of black\nleader who paid obeisance to white leaders and consented to an\noppressive status quo, all for a token pittance or\nself-aggrandizement. Du Bois made this pointed interpretation very\nclear in his The Souls of Black Folks. In the third chapter\n(\u201cOf Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others\u201d) of\nSouls, Du Bois argues against Booker T. Washington\u2019s\naccommodationism in favor of his and Douglass\u2019s demand for, and\nassertion of, black political and social equality and rights. Economic\nliberty is not enough, and any gains in the economic sphere would be\nhampered and vulnerable without the protections and opportunities\nprovided by social and political liberty and rights. And, of course,\neconomic considerations aside, the fight for equal rights and liberty\nis not solely about economic opportunity\u2014it is about equal\ndignity and one\u2019s full humanity.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that Du Bois took on Douglass\u2019s\nmantle of leadership after he argued against Douglass\u2019s view of\nassimilation and amalgamation. In \u201cThe Conservation of\nRaces\u201d, Du Bois rejected amalgamation, which Douglass supported,\nand advocated for conserving a distinct black identity and community\n(1897 [1992]). Here is his critical reduction of the amalgamation\nposition:\n\n\nIt may, however, be objected here that the situation of our race in\nAmerica renders this attitude impossible; that our sole hope of\nsalvation lies in our being able to lose our race identity in the\ncommingled blood of the nation; and that nay other course would merely\nincrease the friction of races which we call race prejudice, and\nagainst which we have so long and so earnestly fought. (Du Bois 1897\n[1992: 488])\n\n\nDu Bois, in opposition to amalgamation, argued that black Americans\nought to embrace a \u201cstalwart originality\u201d that follows\n\u201cNegro Ideals\u201d and not dissolve into a general American\nidentity (Ibid.). It is a view associated with cultural pluralism that\nexpresses an early version of black cultural nationalism. And as such,\nit is a historical conceptual landmark in debates in African social\nand political thought over racial separation versus assimilation and\nthe conservation of race (Boxill 1992a: 173\u201385; 1992b; 1999;\nMcGary 1999a; 1999b: 43\u201361; Pittman\n 1999).[25]\n\nBecause of his cultural pluralism, it is tempting to think that Du\nBois rejected Douglass\u2019s view of assimilation and integration,\nbut that would be a mistake. He turned away from Douglass\u2019s\nvision of total assimilation in favor of retaining some black ideals,\nwhich he too quickly assumed that all blacks qua blacks share. Still,\nhis cultural pluralism has at its end the creation of a community that\nis a \u201cco-worker\u201d in the \u201ckingdom of culture\u201d\n(Du Bois 1903 [1999: 11]). What results from Du Bois\u2019s rejection\nof amalgamation and acceptance of some elements of assimilation is the\nbrilliant idea of double consciousness, especially the double\nconsciousness brought on by the black American experience. As is\nevident from the rhetorical questions at the end of the following\npassage, Du Bois argued against Douglass\u2019s hopes of amalgamation\nand presaged his view of black political, social, and cultural\nsolidarity:\n\n\nNo Negro who has given earnest thought to the situation of his people\nin America has failed, at some time in life, to find himself at these\ncross-roads; has failed to ask himself at some time: What, after all,\nam I? Am I an American or am I a Negro? Can I be both? Or is it my\nduty to cease to be a Negro as soon as possible and be an American? If\nI strive as a Negro, am I not perpetuating the very cleft that\nthreatens and separates Black and White America? Is not my only\npossible aim the subduction of all that is Negro in me to the\nAmerican? Does my black blood place upon me any more obligation to\nassert my nationality than German, or Irish or Italian blood would?\n(Du Bois 1897 [1992: 488])\n\n\nDu Bois\u2019s answers to these questions directly contradict\nDouglass\u2019s view about amalgamation. However, their opinions\nabout assimilation share similarities, such as the co-production and\nenjoyment of a shared American culture. In the end, however, Du\nBois\u2019s image of Douglass is skewed toward his political projects\nof elite leadership, racial solidarity, and uplift.\n\nLikewise, Booker T. Washington\u2019s Douglass is equally a work of\nart that reflects the artist\u2019s image. His The Life of\nFrederick Douglass (1907) presents a picture of Douglass contrary\nto Du Bois\u2019s and is incompatible with many of Douglass\u2019s\nviews. It is, in part, a work of self-promotion. Although Washington\naccurately pointed out the similarities between Douglass and himself,\nhe failed to mention Douglass\u2019s assertions of equal personhood,\nhis uncompromising demands for equal social and political rights, and\nthat Douglass fully expected that black Americans would fully\nintegrate into a \u201ccomposite nation\u201d. Washington\u2019s\nclaim over Douglass\u2019s legacy of leadership falls short of the\nfacts. Douglass was a radical Republican and demanded full inclusion\nof black Americans in the nation\u2019s life and the opening of all\nopportunities for education and advancement for blacks, and Washington\ndid not.\n\nDu Bois\u2019s claims over Douglass, however, also fall short.\nDespite Du Bois\u2019s assumption that he had inherited the mantle of\nblack political, social, and (he would add) cultural leadership from\nDouglass, Douglass\u2019s leadership style and politics were markedly\nmore democratic than Du Bois\u2019s. Although Douglass likely saw\nhimself as an instance of what Ralph Waldo Emerson called a\n\u201crepresentative man\u201d (Emerson 1850 [2004]) and as a\nself-made man to boot (1893 [SFD: 414\u2013453]; 1860d [FDP1 v.3:\n289\u2013300]), he did not envision himself as the embodiment of the\nspirit or culture of his people Gooding-Williams 2009:\n19\u201365).\n\nDouglass\u2019s political activities provide a model of democratic\npolitics in action (Gooding-Williams 2009). He worked with various\ngroups, some underground, while he was enslaved. For example,\nunbeknownst to his master, he participated in at least one Sabbath\nSchool and helped other slaves learn to read and write. And, of\ncourse, he worked with several other black and racially integrated\nadvocacy groups after his escape and emancipation. These groups had\ncross-cutting interests that he had to navigate. He pushed them to\nreach a consensus on different issues, such as in his work with the\nAmerican Equal Rights Association, an organization devoted to\nuniversal suffrage. So, he did not pose as a singular spokesman for\nmovements, groups, or his race, although he never shied away from\npushing or arguing his opinions and promoting democratic action (1848\n[FDSW: 117\u2013122]).\n\nIndeed, his liberal and civic republican ideas influenced his thoughts\nabout leadership and his vision of the work and role of\n\u201cheroes\u201d and so-called \u201crepresentative men\u201d\n(1883b [SFD: 374\u2013400]; 1893 [SFD: 414\u2013453]; 1860d [FDP1\nv.3: 289\u2013300]). For Douglass, they were invaluable in their\nstance against tyranny and defense of equal rights and liberty. On\nJohn Brown, for example, Douglass wrote, putting him into heroic terms\n(with overtones of Thomas Carlyle and Ralph Waldo Emerson),\n\n\nHe believes the Declaration of Independence to be true, and the Bible\nto be a guide to human conduct, and acting upon the doctrines of both,\nhe threw himself against the serried ranks of American oppression, and\ntranslated into heroic deeds the love of liberty and hatred of\ntyrants, with which he was inspired from both these forces acting upon\nhis philanthropic and heroic soul. (1859 [FDSW: 375])\n\n\nThus, in his elegies to John Brown and Abraham Lincoln, we see the\nvalue he places on Emersonian representative men and the ideal of the\nstatesman guided by liberal and civic republican principles (1859\n[FDSW: 372\u2013376]; 1860b [FDSW: 417\u2013421]; 1876 [FDSW:\n616\u2013624]).\n",
