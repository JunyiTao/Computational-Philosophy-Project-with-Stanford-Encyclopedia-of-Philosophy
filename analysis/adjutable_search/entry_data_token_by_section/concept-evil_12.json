    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Evil Action || Evil and Motivation\n3.3 Evil and Motivation\n\nMost theorists writing about evil believe that evil action requires a\ncertain sort of motivational state. Once again, this claim is somewhat\ncontroversial. In the Atrocity Paradigm, Claudia Card makes a\npoint of defining evil without reference to perpetrator motives. She\ndoes this because she wants her theory to focus on alleviating the\nsuffering of victims rather than on understanding the motives of\nperpetrators (Card 2002, 9). Card\u2019s theory also has the virtue\nof being able to count as evil actions which stem from a variety of\nmotives.\n\nHowever, while Card claims that the atrocity paradigm does not have a\nmotivation component, part of the plausibility of her theory comes\nfrom the fact that it restricts the class of evil actions to\nthose that follow from certain sorts of motives. Card\u2019s theory\nof evil is \u201cthat evils are reasonably foreseeable intolerable\nharms produced by inexcusable wrongs\u201d (Card 2010, 16). While\nthis account of evil allows for a wide range of motivations, it does\nspecify that evildoers must foresee the harm they produce and lack a\nmoral justification for producing the harm. In other words, for Card,\nevildoers are motivated by a desire for some object or state of\naffairs which does not justify the harm they foreseeably inflict.\n\nOther philosophers have suggested that evildoers desire to cause harm,\nor to do wrong, for more specific reasons such as pleasure (Steiner\n2002), the desire to do what is wrong (Perrett 2002), the desire to\nannihilate all being (Eagleton 2010), or the destruction of others for\nits own sake (Cole 2006). When evil is restricted to actions that\nfollow from these sorts of motivations, theorists sometimes say that\ntheir subject is pure, radical, diabolical, or monstrous evil. This\nsuggests that their discussion is restricted to a type, or form, of\nevil and not to evil per se.\n\nWhile some philosophers argue that certain motives, such as\nmalevolence or malice, are necessary for evil, others focus instead on\nmotives or desires that evildoers lack. For instance, Adam Morton\ncontends that evildoers are crucially uninhibited by barriers against\nconsidering harming or humiliating others that ought to be there\n(Morton 2004, 57). Similarly, Laurence Thomas contends that one\ndistinctive feature of an evildoer is that \u201cwhereas normally a\nperson\u2019s moral sensibilities would get in the way of his\nperforming an act of such moral gravity [i.e., one that results in\nserious harm], this does not happen when a person performs an evil\nact\u201d (Thomas 1993, 77).\n\nEve Garrard\u2019s theory of evil also focuses on a deficiency in the\nmotivational structure of the evildoer. To understand Garrard\u2019s\ntheory of evil we need to understand the difference between\nmetaphysical and psychological silencers. A metaphysical silencer is a\nreason which is so weighty that, objectively speaking, it takes away\nthe reason-giving force of some other consideration. When this happens\nwe say that the less weighty consideration has been metaphysically\nsilenced. By contrast, a psychological silencer is a reason which is\nso weighty for an individual that, subjectively, it takes\naway the reason-giving force of some other consideration. When this\nhappens we say that the consideration has been psychologically\nsilenced for the individual.\n\nConsider Peter Singer\u2019s case of coming across a child drowning\nin a shallow pond (Singer 1972). If we came across a child drowning in\na shallow pond, the need to rescue the child would be so morally\nimportant that it would metaphysically silence the desire to keep our\nclothes clean as a reason for acting or not acting. That is, when a\nchild is in urgent need of rescue, considerations about keeping our\nclothes clean lose all of their reason-giving force. They cease to be\nreasons for acting or not acting. For many people, especially for\nvirtuous people, considerations about keeping their clothes clean are\nalso psychologically silenced by the urgent need to rescue a child\ndrowning in a shallow pond. In other words, virtuous people are\ncompletely unmoved by considerations about keeping their clothes clean\nwhen presented with children in urgent need of rescue.\n\nAccording to Garrard, the evildoer has a particularly despicable\nmotivational structure. She psychologically silences considerations\nthat are so morally weighty that they metaphysically silence the very\nconsiderations which move her to act (Garrard 1998, 55. See also\nGarrard 2002 and 2019). For instance, it would be evil to\npsychologically silence the urgent need to rescue a drowning child as\na reason for acting because we desire to keep our clothes clean.\n\nCritics of Garrard\u2019s theory of evil argue that it is too\nrestrictive since it does not count as evil actions which cause, or\nallow, significant harm for no good reason when the agent is slightly\nmotivated by morally important considerations (Russell 2007, 675;\nCalder 2015a, 118). For instance, on Garrard\u2019s theory it would\nnot be evil for John to allow a child to drown in a shallow pond if he\nwas slightly motivated to rescue her but not motivated enough to dirty\nhis clothes. Yet it seems that John would do evil by allowing a child\nto drown for those reasons.\n\nOther theorists have developed mixed accounts of the motivational\ncomponent of evildoing. According to these theorists, some forms of\nevildoing are partly constituted by lacking motives\nthat ought to exist while others are partly constituted by having\nbad motives. For example, Matthew Kramer argues that evil actions are\nmotivated by either sadism, heartlessness, or recklessness (Kramer\n2011, 187\u2013203). Paul Formosa argues, contra Kramer, that some evil\nactions follow from other motives\u2014not sadism, heartlessness, or\nrecklessness\u2014such as anger or fear, and that any attempt to\nconstruct a list of motivating states for evil action is bound to be\nincomplete or ad hoc (Formosa 2019, 261). Rather than offer a list of\npossible motivating states for evil action, Todd Calder\u2019s motivational\ncomponent of evildoing states that to perform an evil action\nan agent must desire his victim\u2019s significant harm (or\nstates of affairs inconsistent with the absence of this\nharm) for an unworthy goal, where an unworthy goal is a goal which\n\u201cif attained, would not make for a better state of affairs than\nif the harm was averted and the goal not attained\u201d (Calder 2015a, 120.\nSee also Calder 2003, 266\u2013267).\n",
