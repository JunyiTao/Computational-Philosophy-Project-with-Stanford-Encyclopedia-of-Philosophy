    "main_text": "Decision\n7. Decision\n\nWhen you make a decision, what you choose and the way the world turns\nout together determine an outcome, to which you assign a\nutility that measures how desirable it is for you. In a\ndecision under certainty, each action that you may perform has exactly\none possible outcome. In that case, it seems that you should simply\nperform an action that has maximal utility. (Read on, however!) In a\ndecision under risk, you assign probabilities to the various ways the\nworld could turn out\u2014the possible states. Suppose that\nthere are various actions \\(A_i\\) that you could perform, and various\nstates \\(S_j\\) to which you assign probabilities \\(p_j\\). Together\nthey determine outcomes to which you assign utilities \\(u_{ij}\\).\nClassic decision theory says that you should maximize expected\nutility: you should perform an action that maximizes the weighted\naverage of the utilities associated with that action, the weights\ngiven by your probabilities. Formally, you should maximize\n\n\\[ \\text{EU}(A_i) = \\sum_j p_j u_{ij} \\]\n\n\n(We ignore complications and variations that are irrelevant\nhere\u2014see the entries on\n normative theories of rational choice: expected utility\n and\n decision theory.)\n\nIn standard cases, it is assumed that\n\nthere are finitely many possible actions,\nfinitely many states of the world,\n\n\nand that\n\nthe utilities are finite.\n\n\nHowever, we may drop each of these assumptions, yielding three\ndifferent sources of infinitude in a decision problem. Accordingly, we\nwill present some well-known problems that arise when one or more of\nthese assumptions are violated. We begin with a decision under\ncertainty.\n",
