    "main_text": "Paradoxes: early developments (1897\u20131917) || The mathematicians and the contradictions: Hilbert and Zermelo\n2.4 The mathematicians and the contradictions: Hilbert and Zermelo\n\nZermelo independently discovered Russell\u2019s paradox in\nG\u00f6ttingen (as witnessed by Hilbert and Husserl) in the following\nform: a set \\(M\\) that comprises as elements all of its subsets is\ninconsistent. Indeed, consider the set \\(M_0\\) of all elements of\n\\(M\\) which are not elements of themselves (e.g., the empty set is in\n\\(M_0)\\). This set is a subset of \\(M\\) and hence by assumption on\n\\(M, M_0 \\in M\\). If \\(M_0 \\in M_0\\), then \\(M_0\\) is not a member of\nitself. Hence \\(M_0 \\not\\in M_0\\) and since \\(M_0 \\in M, M_0 \\in\nM_0\\): contradiction.\n\nIn addition, Hilbert had noticed in unpublished work (see Kahle and\nPeckhaus 2002) that additional contradictions of a mathematical nature\ncan arise. The first one derives from assuming that there is a\nwell-defined set \\(C\\) which satisfies the following closure\nconditions: (i) the set \\(N\\) of natural numbers is an element of\n\\(C\\); (ii) \\(X^X \\in C\\), whenever \\(X \\in C\\) (where \\(X^X\\) is the\nset of all functions from \\(X\\) to \\(X)\\); (iii) \\(\\cup X \\in C\\),\nwhenever \\(X \\subseteq C\\). Then by (iii), \\(\\cup C = U \\in C\\) and\nfinally \\(F = U^U \\in C\\). But by definition of union, \\(F \\subseteq\nU\\); hence there would exist a map of \\(U\\) onto \\(F\\) and a\ncontradiction could be derived by diagonalization.\n\nFurthermore, as is witnessed by Hilbert\u2019s unpublished Sommer\nVorlesung 1905 (see Kahle 2004), Hilbert discovered a remarkable\nfunctional version of Russell\u2019s paradox, later to become popular\nin the context of combinatory logic, lambda calculus and recursion\ntheory. The argument is based on functional self-application\nand hence direct self-reference.\n\nThe contradiction is obtained by assuming that the universe includes\neverything, i.e., variables range over both objects and functions, and\nthat there are at least two distinct objects. Then one introduces a\nnew operation (universal application in our sense): \\(xy\\) is the\nresult of applying \\(x\\) to \\(y\\). Given two distinct objects 0 and 1,\nand on the assumption that the universe is closed under arbitrary\ndefinition by cases, there exists an object \\(f\\) such that \\(fx =\n0\\), if \\(xx \\ne 0\\), and \\(fx = 1\\), if \\(xx = 0\\). Then one chooses\n\\(x = f\\) (as \\(x\\) ranges over everything) and easily derives a\ncontradiction.\n\nThe results of the Hilbert school were not published because\ncontradictions and paradoxes were regarded as symptoms of growth and\nas temporary difficulties. The diagnosis was that traditional logic is\ninsufficient and the theory of concept-formation needs to be\nsharpened. Any concept \\(C\\) is given in a network of concepts (letter\nof Hilbert to Frege, Dec. 27, 1899; see Frege 1976, pp. 79\u201380),\nand this network is determined by the axioms. Only the consistency of\nthe axioms that define the concept guarantees the legitimacy of \\(C\\).\nIn a nutshell: paradoxes tell us that we must develop a\nmetamathematical analysis of the notions of proof and of the axiomatic\nmethod; their importance is methodological as well as\nepistemological.\n",
