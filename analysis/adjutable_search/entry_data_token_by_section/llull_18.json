Ars compendiosa inveniendi\nveritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n\nThe first figure of the Ars is\n Figure A,\n composed by 16 terms that correspond to the Dignities: Goodness,\nWisdom, Glory, Simplicity, Greatness, Will, Perfection, Nobility,\nEternity, Virtue, Justice, Mercy, Power, Truth, Generosity,\nDominion.\n\nTwo cases should be noted in this figure: The use of the\nalphabet\u2014the letters that surround the figure from\n\u201cb\u201d to \u201cr\u201d, whose function is to refer to the\nterms inside of the figure in a simplified way, although they are not\nfound in all the versions of the Ars\u2014and the network of\nlines that join each term within the figure with all the remaining\nones, which are not shown in all the versions either. These lines\nillustrate the combinations found within this figure. In this case,\neach one of the 16 terms would have 15 combinations with the remaining\nterms. This combining possibility is supported by the fact that each\nDignity may be converted into another, by the principle of the unity\nof all divine attributes. Moreover, it reflects the principle of the\nargument of equivalence, which, as was already explained, is one of\nthe demonstrative forms of the Ars.\n\nEach one of these combinations would form a compartment, and its set,\na table with all the possible combinations (see the\n Second Figure of A).\n\n\n\nThe Second Figure of A. Ars\ncompendiosa inveniendi veritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031.\nDigital version Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio\nBibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain. Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n, Cultura y\nDeporte.\n\n\nThe second figure of the Ars is called\n Figure S,\n where the rational soul is represented, following St. Augustine, as\nformed by Memory, Intellect, and Will. The representation is, however,\nnot according to the faculties, but to their acts and their\ncombinations.\n\nThe acts of the faculties of the soul are found in the compartments of\n Figure S:\n the intellect, understanding and not understanding; the memory,\nremembering and forgetting; the will, loving, hating, and loving and\nhating. In addition, the compartments contain combinations of letters,\ncorresponding to the ones found in the internal circle, that refer to\nthe combined acts of the faculties. Therefore, d. h. m. refers to, for\nexample, the combined acts of the will that loves, the will that\nhates, the will that loves and hates. b. c. d. refers to the combined\nacts of the memory that remembers, the intellect that understands, the\nwill that loves. Llull groups these combinations in four species named\nE, I, N, R, which are identified by the letter of the compartment\nwhere the combination of the acts of the faculties is found, and which\nforms one of the squares drawn within the circle. Therefore, the\nspecies E identifies the combination b. c. d. The I, the combination\nf. g. h.; the N, the combination k. l. m.; and finally, the R, the\ncombination of these combinations, o. p. q.\n\n\n\nFigure S. Ars compendiosa inveniendi\nveritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n\nThe species not only organize certain acts of the faculties of the\nsoul. Additionally, they also represent certain conducts. Thus,\nspecies E, for example, which is formed by the intellect that\nunderstands, the memory that remembers, and the will that loves,\ncorresponds to the attitude of someone who affirms a proposition with\narguments. I, formed by the intellect that understands, the memory\nthat remembers, and the will that hates, represents the attitude of\nsomeone that denies a proposition with arguments.\n\nSpecies N, where intellect and memory fail to understand and remember,\nthus confirming or denying something, represents supposition, a belief\nthat is not sustained either by arguments or by reasons.\n\nFinally, R, formed by the combination of all the aforementioned\noptions, represents doubt.\n\nThe use of the letters in this case has a distinctive function. F and\nB, for example, have the same meaning: the intellect that understands,\nbut its sense varies according to the relationships found in the\nspecies E and I. Consequently, the use of this letter allows one to\nemphasize this structural sense above the meaning of the words (Bonner\n2007.\n\nFigure S\n can be combined with the rest of the figures of the Ars. As\na result, it is used to build solutions to the questions that are\nformulated in the final sections of the Ars.\n5.2.1 Figure T\n\nFigure T\n is crucial because it is used to build solutions through its\ncombination with other figures. It is formed by three circles\nconnected by triangles of different colors. The triangles connect\nthree concepts (i.e., Difference, Concordance, Contrariety), with\nthree species in each one of the edges that form the circles (i.e.,\nsensual and sensual, sensual and intellectual, intellectual and\nintellectual).\n\nBlue Triangle: God (unity, essence, and dignities); Creature\n(sensual, intellectual, and animal); Operation (intellectual, natural,\nand artificial)\nGreen Triangle: Difference (between sensual and sensual, sensual\nand intellectual, intellectual and intellectual); Concordance (between\nsensual and sensual, sensual and intellectual, intellectual and\nintellectual); Contrariety (between sensual and sensual, sensual and\nintellectual, intellectual and intellectual)\nRed Triangle: Beginning (time, quantity, or cause); Middle\n(extremities, measurement, or conjunction); End (final cause,\ntermination, or privation)\nYellow Triangle: Majority (between substance and substance,\nsubstance and accident, accident and accident); Equality (between\nsubstance and substance, substance and accident, accident and\naccident); Minority (between substance and substance, substance and\naccident, accident and accident)\nBlack Triangle: Affirmation (doubt to being, to non-being, or to\npossible and impossible); Doubt (doubt to being, to non-being, or to\npossible and impossible); Negation (doubt to being, to non-being, or\nto possible and impossible)\n\n\n\n\nFigure T.

Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n5.2.2 Figure V\n\nFigure V is simpler and refers to the virtues and vices, including\nseven of each. In some representations, virtues are red and vices are\nblue, and both are interconnected with each other by lines.\n\nThe figure reflects Llull\u2019s ethical ideas. The system is based on\nthe antithesis between virtues and vices (Rocha 2019). 28 ethical\nnotions are obtained by combining all of its elements. Together with\nthe variants in Figure T, it offers morality rich in nuances and\nalternatives, since the Art is also a method to encourage virtues and\nsuppress vices (according to Trias Mercant 1989). \n\n\n\nFigure V. Ars compendiosa inveniendi\nveritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n5.2.3 Figures X, Y and Z\n\nFigure X, or \u201cFigure of Opposites\u201d or \u201cFigure of\ncontraries and concordances\u201d, is formed by different\noppositions: Predestination/Free Will; Being/Privation;\nPerfection/Defect; Merit/Blame; Supposition/Demonstration; etc. As in\n Figure A,\n the lines join all terms with each other. However, as Llull himself\nexplains, these connections are at times contradictory and at times in\nconcordance, for with this figure Llull represents the problem that\ncertain oppositions\u2014namely predestination and freedom\u2014pose\nfor man.\n\n\n\nFigure X. Ars compendiosa inveniendi\nveritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n\nFinally,\n Figures Y and Z\n are formed by only one concept: Truth Y and Falsehood Z. The\nArs leads to these two directions, represented by the two\nconcepts: towards the definition of the truth or falsehood of certain\npropositions.\n\n\n\nFigure Y and Figure Z. Ars\ncompendiosa inveniendi veritatem XV Century. Palma, BP, 1031.\nDigital version Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio\nBibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain. Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n, Cultura y\nDeporte.\n\n5.3 The Application of the Ars\n\nOnce the figures and terms within have been defined, Llull proceeds to\nshow how they are combined. A substantial part of the several versions\nof the Ars is to show how the relationships between the\nfigures are useful to build a specific argument or to solve a certain\nmatter. Llull uses the word enter (intra) to express the way\nin which a figure is related to another, occasionally using for this\npurpose another figure, usually\n figure T.\n Thus, in the Ars compendiosa inveniendi veritatem, for\nexample, he uses figures A S T V to explain which are the species\ncontrary to the vices. Consequently, he explains that if X (the human\nsoul), with the species E I N enters T in V (figure of vices and\nsins), it is because with species E it understands (b), remembers (c),\nand loves (d) abstinence, whereas by I it understands (g), remembers\n(f), and hates (h) Gluttony. I forms patience when b c d are in\nabstinence, for it is transformed. When the soul enters N (it does not\nunderstand, does not remember, loves and hates) in A (God), Perfection\nand Justice (the compartment [Perfection, Justice]) strengthens E I\nwith a greater concordance through the red triangle (equality).\n\nThis example allows us to follow Llull\u2019s construction of this\nargument, based on the combination of the different figures.\nTherefore, it is an example of a possible combination and a valid\nphilosophical proposition for Llull. If we follow the example, Llull\nuses the combination of the figures to build the argument through\nwhich it is explained how the soul transforms the negation of the\nvices into virtues, when it assumes perfection and justice in God.\n\nLlull does not exhaust all the possible combinations in the different\nversions of the Ars. He presents those that are relevant for\nthe construction of arguments to confront, first and foremost, the\narguments offered by the infidels, by affirming doctrinal principles\nof Christianity. Thus, the possibility remains open for the artist,\nthat is, whoever uses the Ars, to find new combinations and\nnew arguments to be applied in other contexts.\n5.4 Two Variations of the Quaternary Ars\n\nIn Ars demostrativa (1283), Llull introduces two important\nvariations. The first is the inclusion of the\n Elemental Figure,\n which in the first version of the Ars was just a figure that\nsupported\n Figure T.\n The function of this figure, as Bonner (2007) explained, is an\nanalogical substitute of the table of oppositions to emphasize two\naspects: the proper and appropriated qualities, and their concordant\nand contrary.\n\n\n\nFigura Elementalis. Ars\ndemostrativa. Beati Raymundi Lulli Opera, ed. Ivo\nSalzinger i Franz Philipp Wolff, III (Mag\u00fancia: H\u00e4ffner,\n1722. Digital version Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio\nBibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain. Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n, Cultura y\nDeporte.\n\n\nNevertheless, the introduction of the\n Demonstrative Figure\n in Ars demostrativa is particularly meaningful, for it\nsynthesizes the other figures and makes their relationship dynamic.\nThe Demonstrative Figure is formed by six circles, and it includes a\nmechanism that allows the circles to rotate. At the center, Llull\nplaces a triangle, as those found in\n Figure T.\n The first two circles correspond to the\n Elemental Figure,\n the following two, with seven letters, represent Figures A, S, T, V,\nX, Y, Z. The last two circles have the letters B\u2013R that are the\nterms of\n Figure S,\n but Figures A, T, V, X as well, and other two figures, the Principles\nof Theology and the Principles of Philosophy, which are introduced\nwhen the operation of the Art is extended to both fields.\n\n\n\nDemonstrative Figure\n\n\nThe importance of the\n Demonstrative Figure\n resides in its being a step towards the universalization of the\nArs, for it initiates a process of greater abstraction of the\nprinciples. Even though the terms used in the original figures are\nkept, they, as well as the figures themselves, have been substituted\nfor letters. At the same time, it is a figure that rotates, which\nevidently shows the combining character of the Ars. Finally,\nit opens up the Ars beyond its own principles, to be used in\nother fields, such as theology, philosophy, and law.\n5.5 The Ternary Ars\n\nAfter his first visit to Paris and the criticism that ensued, in 1290\nLlull starts to make profound changes that will lead him to\nreformulate the Ars. The Ars generalis ultima,\nwritten between 1305 and 1308, and the Ars brevis, from 1308,\nestablish the most accomplished formulations of this new version of\nLlull\u2019s tool. The changes he introduced to the Ars aim\nto simplify its structure and its function through a greater\nabstraction of its figures and a reduction of its elements.\n\nA general overview of these changes include the reduction of the seven\nbasic figures\u2014A, S, T, V, X, Y, Z\u2014in the first version, to\nonly four. Particularly remarkable is the disappearance of\n Figure S,\n an essential element in the first version, as well as that of figures\nV, X, Y and Z. In the case of V, its terms will be found in other\nsections of the text. The\n Elemental Figure\n and the\n Demonstrative Figure,\n incorporated in the Ars demostrandi, are removed as well.\nThe name of the figures is changed. Instead of using letters, they are\nnow designated First, Second, Third, and Fourth. In all of them, the\nterms shown in the first versions are substituted by letters, and the\nmeanings of these letters, in each one of the figures, are found in an\n\u201calphabet\u201d. In addition, only 9 out of the 16 terms\ncontained in them remain, for the new base of the formulation of the\nArs is a ternary model, and not a quaternary one.\n5.6 The Alphabet and the Figures of the Ternary Ars\n\nThe alphabet is a central element in the ternary formulation of the\nArs. It is formed by nine letters, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K,\nthat using the figures, will be organized to form propositions and\narguments, formulate and solve questions. Each letter has six terms\nassociated with it:\n\n\n\nLetter\nstands for\n\n\nB.\ngoodness\ndifference\nwhether?\nGod\njustice\navarice \n\nC.\ngreatness\nconcordance\nwhat?\nangels\nprudence\ngluttony \n\nD.\nduration\ncontrariety\nof what?\nheaven\nfortitude\nlust \n\nE.\npower\nbeginning\nwhy?\nman\ntemperance\nconceit \n\nF.\nwisdom\nmiddle\nhow much?\nimagination\nfaith\nsloth (acedia) \n\nG.\nwill\nend\nwhat quality?\nsenses\nhope\nenvy \n\nH.\nvirtue\nmajority\nwhen?\nvegetation\ncharity\nwrath \n\nI.\ntruth\nequality\nwhere?\nelements\npatience\nlies \n\nK.\nglory\nminority\nhow and with what?\ninstruments\ncompassion\ninconstancy  \n\n\nThe first of these terms refers to positive attributes that are\napplicable to all the scale of beings. The second corresponds to the\ndefinition of a relationship between entities (it is a reformulation\nof the former\n Figure T).\n The third term corresponds to the Rules and the Questions, and it\nconstitutes the most important tool for research within this model,\nfor they will be used to formulate problems and their solutions. The\nlast three terms correspond to (a) the subjects addressed by the\nArs, (b) virtues, and (c) vices. The figures will be used to\nvisually represent the relationships between the different terms in a\nsimilar way to the previous formulation of the Ars. They are\n54 principles in total, which constitute the basis of the whole system\nand whose relationships are established through the figures.\n5.6.1 First Figure\n\nThe\n First Figure\n is formed by a sole circle of nine elements, whose letters correspond\nto the terms of the first meaning of the alphabet.\n\n\n\nFirst Figure. Ars brevis XVIII\nCentury. Palma de Mallorca BP MS998. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n5.6.2 The Second Figure\n\nThe\n Second Figure\n is formed by three concentric circles connected by three triangles,\nsimilarly to the way\n Figure T\n was shown in the first version of the Art. In this case, only one of\nthe triangles was lost. In the edges of the triangles the terms of the\nsecond meaning of the alphabet are found, each one of them unfolded in\nthree species. Thus, for example: the first triangle deals with\ndifference, concordance, and contrariety (B, C, D). Each one of these\nconcepts has three species: sense and sense, sense and intellect,\nintellect and intellect. The second triangle, beginning, middle, end\n(E, F, G) has different species in each one of the edges. The species\nof beginning are cause, quantity, and time. In Ars brevis\n2-II, Llull explains the following\n\n\ncause means the efficient, material, formal and final causes. Quantity\nand time signify the other predicates and whatever can be reduced to\nthem.\n\n\nBonner (2007) has argued that in this section Llull introduces the\nAristotelian causes and categories, which entails the adoption of the\nterminology and concepts of this logic into his system. The middle\nhas, at the same time, three species that will be formed by the middle\nbetween subject and predicate (e.g., Man is an animal\u2014the\nphysical life), the middle between agent and patient (Love, in the\nrelationship between loved and lover), and the middle between extremes\n(e.g., between two points). The edges of the last minor triangle,\nminor, equal, major (H, I, K) share the same three species: accident\nand accident, substance and accident, substance and substance.\n\n\n\nSecond Figure.

Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n5.6.3 The Third and Fourth Figure\n\nThe\n Third\n and\n Fourth\n Figure of the new formulation of the Art have a similar function. The\nthird is a square in which the binary combinations are represented,\nwhereas the fourth is a representation of the ternary combinations\ninside the Art. The latter is formed by three concentric circles, and\nLlull explains that it must be rotated to form the different\ncombinations. That is, if the starting point of an initial combination\nis BCB, the one that will follow is CCB, building the first nine\nternary combinations accordingly. The circles are, therefore, rotated\nto the next alignment, which is BDB, and the process continues.\n\n\n\nThird Figure. Ars brevis XVIII\nCentury. Palma de Mallorca BP MS998.

Palma de Mallorca BP MS998. Digital version Biblioteca\nVirtual del Patrimonio Bibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain. Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n\n\nUnlike the two first figures, whose letters refer to the terms of the\nfirst and second signification given in the alphabet, in the Third and\nFourth Figures the letters can be substituted by any of the six\nmeanings presented in the alphabet. For example, the combination BC\ncan mean \u201cgoodness is great\u201d\u2014the terms are taken\nfrom the first meaning of the alphabet\u2014but it can also mean\n\u201cdifference is great\u201d, when the first term is taken from\nthe second meaning, and the second term is taken from the first\nmeaning. Likewise, its sense can be \u201cgoodness is\nconcordant\u201d, when the first term is taken from the first\nmeaning, and the second term is taken from the second meaning. Some\nauthors use capital letters when the first sense is used and lowercase\nletters when the second sense is used to facilitate the understanding\nand use of the Art. Thus, the given examples could be expressed as BC,\nbC, Bc.\n\nLlull introduces a table, originated from the\n Fourth Figure,\n in which all the combinations of this figure are found.\n\n\n\nTable of the Fourth Figure (fragment).\nArs brevis XVIII Century. Palma de Mallorca BP MS998. Digital\nversion Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio Bibliogr\u00e1fico. Spain.\nMinisterio de Educaci\u00f3n, Cultura y Deporte.\n\n\nIn this table, the letter T is introduced with a syntactic function to\nstate what terms are taken from the first meaning and which are taken\nfrom the second. The rule is that the letters found before letter T\nuse the first of the meanings of the alphabet, and the ones found\nafter, the second.\n5.7 Practicing the Ars\n\nBoth in Ars generalis ultima and Ars brevis, Llull\nexplains the operation of the Ars in two sections called\n\u201cEvacuating the\n Third Figure\u201d\n and \u201cMultiplying the\n Fourth Figure\u201d.\n\nLlull uses the term \u201cevacuate\u201d to illustrate how all the\nsenses of each one of the combinations are extracted, using the\nintellect as agent. The evacuation starts \u201cby making statements,\nthen we interchange subjects with predicates, and then put\nquestions\u201d (The Ars generalis ultima 6\u20131.\nTranslation Yanis Dambergs) That is, statements are formed using a\nterm from the first meaning of the alphabet (e.g., B, C: goodness is\ngreat); then another one is formed by using the first and second\nmeaning of the alphabet (e.g., b, B: difference is good), and then the\nsubject and the predicate are inverted (e.g., B, b: goodness is\ndifferent). There are 12 meanings in total for each combination of\nletters. The example for BC is:\n\n\n\n\nB\nC\ngoodness is great\n \nb\nB\ndifference is good \n\nB\nb\ngoodness is different\n \nb\nC\ndifference is great \n\nB\nc\ngoodness is concordant\n \nb\nc\ndifference is concordant \n\nC\nB\ngreatness is good\n \nc\nB\nconcordance is good \n\nC\nb\ngreatness is different\n \nc\nC\nconcordance is great \n\nC\nc\ngreatness is concordant\n \nc\nb\nconcordance is different  \n\n\n\nAfterwards, the corresponding questions to the third meaning of the\nletters according to the alphabet are introduced. In the case of B and\nC, it would be whether and what. Thus, based on the affirmations, the\nexample would be: \u201cGoodness is great\u201d, \u201cWhether\ngoodness is great?\u201d, and \u201cWhat is great goodness?\u201d\nThis process is applied to the 12 affirmations, thus obtaining a total\nof 36 possible meanings for the combination BC. This procedure must be\nfollowed with all the combinations found in the\n Third Figure.\n5.7.1 The Definitions and the Rules\n\nThe definitions and rules offered by Llull as part of the Ars\nmust be used to complete the evacuation and make sense of all 36\npossible combinations. There are 18 definitions: nine of them\ncorrespond to the first meaning of the alphabet, and the other nine,\nto the second meaning. The first five, for example, state that:\n\n\n\n\nB.\nGoodness is that whereby good does good. \n\nC.\nGreatness is that through which goodness, duration etc. are\ngreat. \n\nD.\nDuration is that through which goodness, greatness etc. are\nlasting. \n\nE.\nPower is that through which goodness, greatness etc. can exist\nand act. \n\nF.\nWisdom is a property by which the wise understand. \n\n\n\n\nBonner (2007) has noted that a distinctive feature of the definitions\nproposed by Llull is that they do not follow the Aristotelian model.\nOn the contrary, they define the subject based on his activity, which\nallows the application of the definition of greatness, for example, to\nany of the beings in the ladder and not exclusively to God. That is\nprecisely what he would do to complete the evacuation of the\n Third Figure,\n as will be explained later.\n\nThe rules correspond to the third of the meanings given to the\nalphabet. Each one of these questions has, at the same time, species\nthat will be useful to establish the type of answer that is sought or\nthe nature of the question that wishes to be formulated. For example,\nthe first, \u201cWhether?\u201d, has three species, namely doubt,\naffirmation, and negation. The second, \u201cWhat?\u201d, has four\nspecies: the first defines the subject, the second defines the\ncorrelatives, the third asks what a certain thing is in another thing\n(e.g., \u201cWhat is the intellect in other things?\u201d), and the\nfourth asks what a certain thing does or has in another thing (e.g.,\n\u201cWhat does the intellect have in other things?\u201d).\n\nTo finalize the evacuation of the\n third figure,\n the intellect has to build the meanings with these tools, following\nthe guide offered by the definitions and the rules. For example, in\nthe case of the first combination BC, \u201cgoodness is great\u201d,\nfollowing rule C, the question is formulated as \u201cIs goodness\ngreat?\u201d Its evacuation would follow the application of the first\nspecies of Rule C, to define the predicate: \u201cGreatness is a\nbeing on account of which goodness is great.\u201d Then, the second\nspecies of Rule C, by which the subject is defined by its correlative,\nwould be: \u201cGoodness is great because it has its essential\nbonifier, bonifiable, and bonifying\u201d. Consequently, following\nthe fourth species in Rule C (What does goodness have in greatness?),\ngoodness would have in greatness its \u201cnatural repose\u201d.\nFinally, the third species of Rule C (What is goodness in\ngreatness?),\n\n\nit is in difference and concordance by definition as it differentiates\nand merges its coessential correlatives within its genus and essence\nfrom which great moral goodness arises. (The Ars generalis\nultima 6\u20131. Translation Yanis Dambergs)\n\n5.7.2 Multiplication of the Fourth Figure\n\nFor the\n fourth figure,\n Llull follows a similar procedure to the one found in the\n third figure.\n First, ternary combinations can be made based on the initial\ncombination. For example, based on B C D, B C E would follow, then B C\nF, and so on. Consequently, for each triple combination of letters,\nfor example, B C D, it is possible to formulate 20 questions based on\nthe first, the second, and the third meaning of the alphabet to obtain\nthe form of a question. There are 20 questions in total for each\ncolumn in the table. For example:\n\n\n\n\nB\nC\nD\nWhether goodness is so great that it is eternal? \n\nB\nC\nb\nWhether there is some goodness so great that it contains within\nitself different things coessential with itself? \n\nC\nD\nb\nWhat is great difference of eternity? \n\nC\nD\nc\nWhat is great and eternal concordance? \n\nD\nb\nc\nOf what does the difference of concordance and eternity\nconsist? \n\nD\nb\nd\nOf what does the difference of eternity and contrariety\nconsist?  \n\n\n\nThe way to solve these questions follows the same procedure as in the\ncase of the\n third figure,\n combining definitions and rules, according to the involved letters,\ntheir meaning in the alphabet, and the species of the rules used in\neach one of them.\n5.7.3 Combination of the Principles, the Rules, the Subjects, the Virtues, and the Vices\n\nIn the ternary form of the Ars, Llull extensively uses the\ncombining structure. Thus, the principles of the\nArs\u2014the first and the second meaning of the\nalphabet\u2014are combined among themselves and the rules to obtain\nan exhaustive relationship of all that can be affirmed from the\ncombination of the principles and the rules. This is a fundamental\ntool for the user of the Ars, for it is following this\n\u201cmixture\u201d, as designated by Llull, of the principles, that\nthe identification of the appropriate principle to solve the questions\nwill be easier. The same combining procedure must be applied to the\nnine subjects or beings with which Llull has formed a hierarchy of\nreality\u2014the fourth meaning of the alphabet: God, Angel, Heaven,\nMan, imaginative, sensitive, vegetative, elementative, instrumentality\nor artifice. Each one of these must be combined with the principles\nand the rules to exhaustively obtain what can be said of each one, in\norder to answer concrete questions. This procedure is also applied to\nthe fifth and sixth meaning of the alphabet, that is, the virtues and\nvices.\n5.7.4 Questions and Use of the Ars\n\nBoth Ars Generalis Ultima and Ars Brevis conclude\nwith a sequence of questions that can be formulated, and it is\nnormally illustrated how they are answered using the combining\nmechanisms of the Ars. However, these are not the only\nquestions that the Ars can answer. Llull himself explains in\nboth texts that, above all, the Ars is an instrument to solve\nproblems and develop arguments. Consequently, the majority of the\nresolved questions show the exemplary character of the use of the\nArs. In the section dedicated to the teaching of the\nArs, Llull notes two things. The first highlights the\nintention of creating an instrument to reason without appealing to\nauthority. He writes in Ars Generalis Ultima 13\u20132:\n\n\nSecond, he shall clearly explain the text to the students through\nreasoning, without any appeal to authority, and the students shall\nread through the text, and put any questions they have about it to the\nteacher. (Translation Yanis Dambergs)\n\n\nBut the ultimate sense of the teaching and use of the Art is\nillustrated in this recommendation in the Ars generalis\nultima 13\u20133:\n\n\nThe teacher shall propose questions to the students and solve them by\nproviding reasons according to the process of this art, for without\nreasoning, the artist cannot make it work. Here we should note that\nthe art has three friends, namely intellectual subtlety, skill in\nreasoning, and good intentions, for without these, no one can learn\nit. (Translation Yanis Dambergs)\n",
