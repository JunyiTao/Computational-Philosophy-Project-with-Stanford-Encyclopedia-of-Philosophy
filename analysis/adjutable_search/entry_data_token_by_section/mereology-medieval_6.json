    "main_text": "Wholes || Potential wholes\n2.3 Potential wholes\n\nIn addition to integral wholes and universal wholes, Boethius\nintroduces a third basic type of whole to medieval philosophers: the\nwhole consisting of \u201cpowers\u201d (potentiae) or\n\u201cvirtues\u201d (virtutes) (On Division 888a).\nThese wholes are often called \u201cvirtual wholes\u201d or\n\u201cpotential wholes\u201d. This article will follow that\npractice, but it should be understood that in medieval contexts\n\u201cpotential\u201d usually signifies something that is in some\nrespect not fully actualized, and, hence, in some contexts\n\u201cpotential whole\u201d and \u201cpotential part\u201d refer\nto things that are possibly, but not actually divided, as when a\ncontinuum with a certain magnitude is potentially divisible but not\nactually divided into halves or fourths, or when a substance is said\nto be potentially divisible into its elemental constituents (see\nPasnau 2011, 606\u2013629). This standard sense of\n\u201cpotency\u201d is even at work in the potential wholes that\nBoethius is talking about, since the soul\u2019s powers are typically\nrelated to the soul\u2019s \u201coperations\u201d, or activities,\nand these activities are clearly not always occurring. A soul might\nhave the power to see or the power to think, even though it is not\npresently seeing or thinking. Nonetheless, these Boethian potential\nwholes are actual and actually possess these potential parts; they are\nnot \u201cpotential\u201d in the sense that they are possible things\nor things that are merely capable of being divided.\n\nPotential wholes are curious items. They are particulars, not\nuniversals. Yet potential wholes are not composed out of their parts\nin the way that, for example, a house is composed out of bricks and\nwood. Indeed, the most commonly discussed kind of potential whole is a\nsoul. But for Aristotelians souls are forms and it is generally held\nthat forms are mereologically simple. Thus, souls ought to be\nmereologically simple. That Boethius, or for that matter, Aristotle\nasserts that souls have parts is therefore initially quite puzzling.\n(For a list of the places where Aristotle talks about the parts of the\nsoul as well as a defense of the claim that we should take\nAristotle\u2019s use of the term \u201cparts\u201d seriously, see\nJohansen 2014.)\n\nFurther reflection, however, shows us that a soul (and especially a\nhuman soul) is a complicated thing. It has a variety of capacities,\nwhich seem to be really distinct from one another and possibly from\nthe soul itself. Some of these capacities even seem to be contrary to\none another. For example, a soul seems to be capable of psychic\nconflict. There is a lot of pressure then put on this putatively\nsimple, yet obviously complicated thing, and therefore it is hardly\nsurprising that there is a robust medieval debate over the nature of\nthe parts or powers of the soul (see Perler 2015). Some think that the\npressure is too great to sustain and that one substantially simple\nthing cannot be the subject of all these capacities. Two common\nreasons are given for the soul\u2019s being really divided in a\nsubstantial manner. First, it seems that really distinct operations\nmust stem from really distinct sources, and since operations are\naccidents of substances, this would seem to imply that the operations\nof a soul must stem from distinct substantial sources. Second,\naccording to Aristotle, the rational capacities do not require a\nbodily instrument to operate, where the other capacities do. This\nleads some medieval Aristotelians to conclude that whereas the\nnon-rational capacities arise from the matter of the thing, the\nrational capacities must come from some external source. This, in\nturn, suggests that a human being has at least one substantial form\nthat is rooted in and arises from the matter, and another substantial\nform that comes from an external source. If all of this is right, then\nhumans at least either have several souls, or one substantially\ncomposite soul, where the parts are viewed as\n\u201cincomplete\u201d substances that combine to form one\n\u201cperfected\u201d soul (see Pasnau 1997; Perler 2014). Others,\nand most famously Aquinas and his followers, hold that a living thing\ncan only have one substantial form and therefore only one soul (Pasnau\n2002, 126\u201330). These \u201cunitarians\u201d must come up with\nan answer to how the powers do not in fact divide the soul into souls,\nespecially those unitarians like Aquinas who hold that the powers of\nthe soul are really distinct from the soul itself. (In fact, according\nto King (2008), the dominant view in the medieval period is that the\nsoul\u2019s powers are really distinct from the soul\u2019s\nsubstance.) A commonly proposed solution is that the powers\n\u201cflow out\u201d from the soul\u2019s essence and that the\nsubordinate powers of the soul are \u201cvirtually present\u201d in\nthe soul (see Shields 2014 for an analysis of Su\u00e1rez\u2019s\nversion of this solution; also Perler 2015).\n\nIn keeping with the introductory nature of his treatise, Boethius\nremains silent about many of these issues and instead focuses on the\nlogical nature of the soul considered as a whole consisting of powers.\nUnfortunately, what he says actually makes matters all the more\nobscure since he notes that the division of a potential whole\nresembles both the division of a genus and the division of a\nwhole:\n\nFor in that each and every part of it entails the predicate\n\u201csoul\u201d it is brought into connection with the division of\nthe genus, each and every species of which necessarily entails the\ngenus itself. On the other hand, in that not every soul is composed of\nall parts but each one is composed differently, in this it is\nnecessarily brought into connection with the nature of a whole.\n(On Division 888c\u2013d [trans. Magee 1998, 41])\n\n\nSome earlier medieval philosophers take Boethius\u2019 statement as\nan invitation to reduce the soul, and the potential whole in general,\nto either a genus or an integral whole. (One of the first attempts to\nplace the division of soul under the division of the genus is found in\na short letter from a mysterious ninth-century thinker identified only\nas \u201cMaster L\u201d. The letter is preserved in the manuscripts\nof St. Gall, and is transcribed by De Rijk (1963, 75\u201378).)\nHowever, the attempt to reduce soul to either a genus or an integral\nwhole appears doomed, for potential wholes do not fit well under\neither category. Souls are particular, and hence, they cannot be\nuniversals of any kind, let alone genera. On the other hand, by\nintroducing the potential whole as an additional kind of\nwhole, Boethius appears to be signalling that potential wholes do not\nhave parts in the same way that other true wholes have parts: Socrates\ncan be separated into his hands, feet, and so forth; a chemical\nmixture can be reduced back into its ingredients. Even a universal\nwhole can be separated into independently existing parts, namely, the\nindividuals that are its parts. But a soul is neither constructed out\nof its powers, nor does it appear to be separable into freestanding\nparts: the powers must be powers of a soul.\n\nWe begin to see some progress in the twelfth century. For example, in\na treatise that has been attributed to the young Peter Abelard we\nlearn that there are two definitions of soul, a \u201csuperior\u201d\none in virtue of which the soul \u201chas an affinity with a\nuniversal whole\u201d, and an \u201cinferior\u201d definition in\nvirtue of which soul has an affinity with an integral whole:\n\nThis is the superior definition of \u201csoul\u201d: soul is a\nquality with respect to which a body is made to be alive. It is in\naccord with this definition that \u201csoul\u201d is predicated of\nits parts individually, and thus the power of knowing is a quality\nwith respect to which a body is made to be alive, and the power of\nsensing is a quality with respect to which a body is made to be alive.\nThis is the inferior definition of \u201csoul\u201d: soul is a\nquality constituted out of rationality, out of sensibility, and out of\nvegetability (vegetabilitate). And it is with respect to this\ndefinition that [soul] cannot be predicated of its parts taken\nsingularly, since one cannot say that the power of thinking is that\nwhich is constituted out of rationality, sensibility, and\nvegetability. ((ps?) Abelard, De divisionibus\n194.12\u201322)\n\n\nThis solution helps to explain the strange predicative behavior of\nsoul and its powers. It also, interestingly, provides us with a\nsolution to what a potential part is: The soul turns out to be a\nquality composed in a fairly familiar sense of\n\u201ccomposition\u201d out of other qualities. The commentator thus\nattempts to explain the tricky notion of potential-parthood in terms\nof more understandable relations, namely, the predication relation and\nthe relation of an integral part to its whole.\n\nIn his commentary on Boethius\u2019s text, Albert the Great takes a\ndifferent approach (In de Div. tract. 4, ch. 1; Loe ed.,\n75\u20139). He refers to the view that a potential whole is some sort\nof intermediary between a universal and an integral whole, but then he\nproceeds to give a different explanation why a potential whole is a\nwhole: It is a whole because the full and complete list of the\ncapacities will produce the full and complete account of the soul in\nso far as it is the principle of life and self-motion. But it does not\nfollow from this that any given particular soul will have all of the\npowers and capacities on the list. Albert also hastens to add that\nwhile a full list of the capacities of soul gives us the substance of\nthe principle of life and motion, under this description we are not\nattending to a substance in the absolute sense. We, thus, should not\nconclude that a soul is divisible in the way that an integral whole is\ndivisible. That is, these capacities need not answer to little\nsubstances or parts of substances that constitute the soul. To help us\nto see his point, Albert offers an example of another potential\nwhole:\n\nAnd again a regime (regnum) is a whole of this kind, given\nthat it consists of its powers, namely, the king, the prefect, the\nsuperintendent, and others of this sort. (In de Div. tract.\n4, ch. 1; Loe ed., 75)\n\n\nAlbert is thinking of the regime in terms of an act or role, which is\nanalyzable and hence consists in smaller roles and their associated\npowers. The complete list of the roles in regimes would give the whole\nof what it is to be a regime. But like individual souls, a particular\nregime will require some of these roles and their attendant powers,\nbut it need not possess all of them. Moreover, a difference in role\ndoes not imply a difference in subject. The same person could perform\nsome or even all of these distinct roles.\n",
