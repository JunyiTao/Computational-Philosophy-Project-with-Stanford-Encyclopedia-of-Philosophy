As per Asymmetric modal dependence, it\nis characteristic of determinates that they asymmetrically necessitate\ntheir associated determinables, thanks to the distinctively unspecific\nnature of determinables. Hence Armstrong says:\n\n\nA point to be taken very seriously is that because determinates entail\nthe corresponding determinable, the determinable supervenes on the\ndeterminates, and so, apparently, is not something more than the\ndeterminates. (1997: 50)\n\n\nAsymmetric necessitation appears to be insufficient for\nnon-fundamentality, however, as is reflected in standard concerns that\n(even asymmetric) supervenience is too weak to guarantee complete\nmetaphysical dependence (see, e.g., Horgan 1993, Wilson 2005, and\nMcLaughlin and Bennett\n 2005).[38]\n Nor is asymmetric necessitation necessary for the holding of a\npriority relation, as Fine\u2019s (1994) case of Socrates and the\nsingleton set of Socrates shows. As such, one can reasonably deny that\nthe asymmetric necessitation of determinables by determinates\nestablishes that determinables are less fundamental than\ndeterminates.\n\nEven accepting the criterion, one can question whether it shows that\ndeterminates are metaphysically prior to determinables. As French\n(2014) observes, while determinable instances do not entail any\nparticular determinate instances, there is nevertheless\n\u2018two-way\u2019 entailment: every determinate instance entails\ndeterminable instances, and every determinable instance entails some\ndeterminate instance. One might respond that the word\n\u2018some\u2019 expresses residual asymmetry in priority as opposed\nto simply reflecting that determinables are less specific than\ndeterminates, but as French notes, \u201cthose who exclude\ndeterminables from the fundamental base need to show what specificity\nhas to do with fundamentality\u201d (2014: 284).\n",
