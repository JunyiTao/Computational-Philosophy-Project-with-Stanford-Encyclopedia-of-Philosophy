    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The Four Causes\n3.2 The Four Causes\n\nJust as medieval thinkers adopted Aristotle\u2019s four inquiries, so\ntoo did they adopt his distinction of four types of causes (material,\nformal, efficient, and final) elaborated in Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics v.2 and other places. Although Israeli adopts the\nschema, he notes that within each of the four categories a cause can\nbe either spiritual or corporeal. While a \u201cspiritual material\ncause\u201d might sound oxymoronic to our ears, in his Book of\nDefinitions Israeli provides an example:\n\nA case of a spiritual material cause is that of the genera which are\ndivided into their species and are the substratum for their forms\nwhich complete their speciality, as for instance \u2018living\nbeing\u2019, which is the genus of man and horse and other species,\nand is the substratum for their forms which constitute their essence.\n(Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, p. 24)\n\n\nJust as spiritual material causes are the material substratum for\ngenera, spiritual formal causes are substantial forms of genera. These\ngenera \u201ccause\u201d those objects which partake of them to be\nas they are. Israeli\u2019s example of a spiritual efficient cause is\nparadoxical:\n\nA case of the spiritual efficient cause is the power of the sphere\nwhich was appointed by the Creator, may He be exalted, in nature, and\nordained in it over the effects which take place in the corporeal\nmicrocosm\u2026 (Altmann and Stern, Isaac Israeli, p. 25)\n\n\nThe prevalent medieval conception of the sphere of the cosmos is that\nit is not a vacuum, but rather, crystalline and composed of a fifth\nelement superior to the four elements of our terrestrial world. Hence,\nit would appear that the efficient spiritual cause could also be an\nefficient material cause. However, this difficulty is resolved if what\nIsraeli meant here was an intelligence or soul governing the sphere.\nAlthough Israeli does not in any of his surviving writings and\nfragments mention a soul of the spheres, his pupil Dunash Ibn Tamim\naffirms it in his commentary on Sefer Yetzirah.\n",
