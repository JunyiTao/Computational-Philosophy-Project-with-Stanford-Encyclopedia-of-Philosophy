    "main_text": "Religious Minimalism || Wittgenstein\n5. Reference and Logic\n\nAlthough they have received less attention that the other topics in\nthis article, two other issues relating to religious language should\nbe noted. First, the reference of \u201cGod\u201d, second, the logic\nof religious language.\n\nRecent work on the reference of \u201cGod\u201d mostly proceeds from\nthe assumption that \u201cGod\u201d is a name rather than a title or\na description (for criticism of this view see Johnston 2011:\n6\u20137; for supporting arguments see Scott 2013: 86\u20137). From\nthis starting point, attention has focused on how to apply the rich\nresources of research on names from the philosophy of language to this\ncase. For example, according to descriptivist theories\n\u201cGod\u201d has a descriptive content (a view that stretches\nback at least as far as Anselm), whereas according to Millian theories\n\u201cGod\u201d refers to its bearer without conveying any\ninformation about the object referred to. The latter theory can be\ncombined with a causal theory of reference (Kripke 1980) to explain\nhow the name becomes attached to the referent. Although many of the\narguments in this debate derive from the philosophy of language, there\nare also interesting implications of these positions for the\nphilosophy of religion. For instance, a descriptivist theory appears\nto place limits on how wrong we can be about what God is like. A\ncausal theory of reference, in contrast, will need to be backed up by\na defence of the possibility of causal interaction with God and an\naccount of how God is named. For discussion of these theories see\nAlston 1989 and 1991, Gellman 1997 and Sullivan 2012. For a recent review of the\nfield see Scott 2013: ch. 7.\n\nDoes religious language adhere to a non-classical logic? This issue\nhas been raised in at least two contexts. First, some of the writings\nof authors in the apophatic tradition have been seen as supporting a\nparaconsistent logic of religious language, specifically dialetheism,\nthe view that some contradictory sentences are true (see Priest 2002:\n22\u20133, although Scott & Citron 2016: 72 cast doubt on this as\na plausible interpretation of apophatic authors). Second, Michael\nDummett considers a number of arguments in favour of the view the\ndivine omniscience entails bivalence, i.e., that for any statement\np it is determinately either true or false. For example, if God\nknows that p, then He knows that he knows that p and\ntherefore it is true; but if God does not know p then He knows\nthat He does not know it and hence knows that it is not true. From\nthis it can be shown that God must know whether p is true or\nfalse, thereby securing bivalence (2004: 94\u201396; see also 1991:\n318\u20139, 348\u2013351). Since, for Dummett, realism for a field\nof discourse hinges on the success of the principle of bivalence for\nthe statements of that discourse, it would follow that theism leads to\nglobal realism. For a critical discussion of Dummett\u2019s arguments\nsee Scott and Stevens 2007.\n",
