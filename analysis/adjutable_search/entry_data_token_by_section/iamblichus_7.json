    "main_text": "Iamblichus\u2019 System || The One and the higher principles\n3.1 The One and the higher principles\n\nIamblichus\u2019 account of the One is difficult to ascertain, since\nthe crucial testimony (Damascius, De principiis II,\n1.4\u201316.19 Comb\u00e8s & Westerink) is somewhat oblique.\nWhat lies beyond doubt is that Iamblichus reacted against\nPorphyry\u2019s introduction of a first principle\n\u201ccoordinated\u201d with the Intelligible Triad by positing two\nlevels above it: on the one hand, a \u201cwholly unspeakable\nprinciple\u201d\u2014which Theodorus of Asine and Damascius\nincorporated into their own theology, although Proclus did not: on the\nsubject, see Linguiti 1988\u2014and, on the other hand, a principle\n\u201cuncoordinated with the triad\u201d. In this respect,\nIamblichus seems to have wished to distinguish between two almost\ncontradictory aspects of the first principle: its transcendence with\nrespect to everything else (negative theology), i.e., absoluteness in\na literal sense; and its causative aspect (cataphatic theology).\nIamblichus, then, appears to have conceived of his \u201cunspeakable\nprinciple\u201d as a safeguard against any objection based on\nindefinite regress in the chain of causes, while the principle that is\n\u201cuncoordinated to the triad\u201d is akin to Plotinus\u2019\nOne, insofar as it lies above the Intellect.\n\nBelow the One is located the intelligible triad of Limit, the\nUnlimited, and the One-Being. This arrangement shows the influence of\nPlato\u2019s Philebus 26C (with the uncoordinated One\nas the Cause, and the One-Being as the mikton): this is\naccounted for in Van Riel 2008. Damascius assimilates this sequence to\nanother one attributed to \u201cthe Pythagoreans\u201d:\nMonad-Dyad-Triad, and, ultimately, to the system of principles\ninferred from the Chaldean Oracles: Father-Power-Intellect.\nIt is likely that the same interpretation was already to be found in\nIamblichus, given that both Pythagoras and the Chaldeans rank high in\nhis list of authorities.\n\nWhether Iamblichus introduced the doctrine of \u201chenads\u201d\ninto the teachings of the Neoplatonic School remains controversial\n(see Clark 2010; Mesyats 2012; Opsomer in Opsomer et al. 2018:\n1365\u20131366). The henads (literally \u201cunities\u201d) are the\nvery first plurality emanating from the One: since they are located\nbeyond Being itself, they are meant to bridge the gap between the\nabsolute One and the intelligible world. Iamblichean authorship of\nthis theory would make it predate Syrianus and Proclus\u2014its first\nexplicit proponents\u2014by almost a century, and indeed several\nhints point in that direction, in particular the fact that, according\nto Proclus, Iamblichus identified \u201cGod and the gods\u201d as\nthe subject of the first hypothesis of Plato\u2019s\nParmenides. These \u201cgods\u201d might be self-sufficient\nitems located right below the One and, judging by the\u2014admittedly\nvery allusive\u2014testimonies of Proclus (references in Saffrey\n& Westerink 1968\u20131997: III, pp. XVII\u2013XXVI) and\nDamascius, might indifferently be called \u201chenads\u201d or\n\u201cintelligible gods\u201d, in contradiction with Syrianus\u2019\nand Proclus\u2019 later terminological distinctions.\n\nThere is also another hint in support of this interpretation.\nDamascius explicitly states that according to Iamblichus divinity is\nclosely correlated to degrees of unity: the intelligible gods are\n\u201ccrystallised, as it were, around the One\u201d (De\nprincipiis II, 36.17). According to this conception, the higher a\ngod is situated on the scale of reality, the more\n\u201cunified\u201d and undifferentiated it is, and the less\naccessible to the intellect and to conceptual knowledge: one can only\nknow such realities by resorting to intuition. This doctrine is hinted\nat in various passages of Iamblichus\u2019 Reply to Porphyry\n(where unity, \u201cfriendship\u201d\u2014philia\u2014and\ngoodness are all described as fundamental attributes of the gods:\n\u201cwhatever Being might be in them, this is equivalent to their\nunity\u201d, I, 19 [SS-2013: 45.8\u201310]) and is also compatible\nwith his stressing the fact that knowledge of the gods is innate,\nlying as it does within the heart of every individual (I, 3 [SS-2013:\n5.14\u201320]). From an historical point of view, this gradual\ndiffusion of unity also represents a major contribution to the\nrepresentation of reality as a continuum, thereby somewhat bridging\nthe rift that, following Plotinus, had emerged between the One and the\nIntellect. \u201cUnification\u201d too (hen\u014dsis) also\nbecomes a key philosophical term, and this opens up the possibility of\nan anti-intellectual slant, as can be found in a famous extract of the\nReply to Porphyry (II, 11 [SS-2013: 73.1\u201316]).\n",
