Pre-Prison Journalism and Political Writings\n\nGramsci\u2019s overt \u201cphilosophical\u201d references in his\nwritings prior to the Notebooks are sporadic and bound\nclosely to his responses to wider events. He wrote as a committed\nsocialist and revolutionary critic, albeit as an intellectual\nskeptical of prevailing orthodoxies (influenced, arguably, by his\nsouthern upbringing which made him something of an\n\u201coutsider\u201d to mainstream progressive opinion). Like many\nItalian commentators, he shared the view that the liberal\nstate\u2019s fundamental shortcoming consisted in a failure to build\npopular and inclusive governing institutions. The task remained,\ntherefore, \u201cto make Italians\u201d (fare gli italiani)\nas one critic put it, that is, to find a model of association to\nculturally integrate citizens (see Bellamy 1987). This general problem\ninforms Gramsci\u2019s pre-prison writings as well as his later\naccount of hegemony (see Bellamy & Schecter 1993).\n\nThe period up to Gramsci\u2019s arrest was a dramatically evolving\ncontext of social and political crisis in Italy and across Europe\ngenerally. Gramsci earned local recognition during and after the war\nas a biting, \u201cserious\u201d radical journalist. He was\nacerbically critical of Italy\u2019s ruling elite and the\nbourgeoisie\u2019s shallow moral sensibilities. For example, in 1918\nhe denounced the widespread use of cocaine as \u201can index of\nbourgeois progress\u201d and bemoaned the absence, demonstrated by\nthe Italian card game scopone, of a \u201cconcept of\n\u2018fair play\u2019\u201d proper to developed capitalist\nsocieties (see PPW: 72, 74). From the early 1920s, by contrast, his\naudience was primarily party members, and his writing was steeped in\nthe technical language of revolutionary communist analysis.\n\nDespite this shifting register, several related philosophical themes\nand influences can be discerned that characterized his thinking\nthroughout his pre-prison activities. These can be summarized as:\n\na \u201chumanist\u201d opposition to scientific positivism and\nmaterialist determinism for its neglect of the subjective dimension to\nhuman action. Here he was influenced by neo-idealist philosophers and\ncritics of the classical Marxist tradition, primarily Benedetto\nCroce;\na radical insistence on the force of subjectively motivated\ncollective action, expressed as the formation of a unified moral will.\nThe most popular source of this view in Italy was the revolutionary\nsyndicalist thinker, Georges Sorel; and\na preference for collective self-liberation and a rejection of\nauthoritarian, elitist, or artificially imposed systems of rule. Such\nviews were common among radical critics of the liberal state and its\nprotectionist policies, such as the socialist reformer and analyst of\nsouthern underdevelopment, Gaetano Salvemini.\n\n\nThese themes and influences combined in Gramsci\u2019s criticism of\nthe liberal political class and his promotion of socialism. Three\nsequential phases of his pre-prison thinking can be distinguished: his\nearly cultural socialism\n (\u00a72.1);\n his post-war theory of the factory-based workers\u2019 state\n (\u00a72.2);\n and his later, developing reflections on communist party strategy\n (\u00a72.3).\n",
