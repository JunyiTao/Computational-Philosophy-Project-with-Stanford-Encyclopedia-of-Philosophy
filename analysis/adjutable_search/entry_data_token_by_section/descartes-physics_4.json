    "main_text": "Space, Body, and Motion\n3. Space, Body, and Motion\n\nDescartes\u2019 many hypotheses concerning space and body are best\nappreciated when viewed as a continuation of a long debate within\nMedieval/Renaissance philosophy centered upon the Aristotelian dictum\nthat whatever possessed dimensionality was body (see, Grant 1981).\nWhile some philosophers, such as Telesio, Campanella, and Bruno, held\nspace to be always filled with matter (i.e., a plenum) yet somehow\nindependent of matter, others, like Patrizi and Gassendi, endorsed a\nmore absolutist notion that allowed spaces totally devoid of matter\n(i.e., vacuum). Rejecting these anti-Aristotelian ideas of empty\nspace, Descartes equated the defining property, or\n\u201cessence\u201d, of material substance with three-dimensional\nspatial extension: \u201cthe extension in length, breadth, and depth\nwhich constitutes the space occupied by a body, is exactly the same as\nthat which constitutes the body\u201d (Pr II 10). Consequently, there\ncannot exist a space separate from body (Pr II 16), since all spatial\nextension simply is body (and he rejects the possibility of a vacuum\nthat is not extended). If, for example, God removed the matter within\na vessel (such that nothing remained), then the sides of the vessel\nwould immediately become contiguous (but not through motion; Pr II\n18). It is important to note that Descartes\u2019 claim, that the\nvessel\u2019s sides must become contiguos, was a fairly common view\namong the Scholastics, since they also accepted the idea that spatial\nextension required a substance to ground extension (see, Grant 1981,\n122). Descartes argues that, with respect to the empty vessel, that\n\u201cnothingness cannot possess any extension\u201d, since\n\u201call distance is a mode of extension, and therefore cannot exist\nwithout an extended substance\u201d (Pr II 18). While Descartes\naccepts a substance-property metaphysics, the rejection of the empty\nvessel scenario seems more motivated by his nominalism, which is the\nview that only particulars exist, whereas universals are only names\nand abstractions from particluar things. As he states in an earlier\nsection of the Principles as regards numbers, \u201cwhen\nnumber is not being considered in any created things, but only in the\nabstract or in general, it is merely a mode of thought\u201d (Pr I\n58).\n\nDescartes\u2019 actual concept of \u201cspace\u201d can be regarded\nas a sort of conceptual abstraction from this bodily spatial\nextension, which he also dubs \u201cinternal place\u201d:\n\nWe attribute a generic unity to the extension of the space [of a\nbody], so that when the body which fills the space has been changed,\nthe extension of the space itself is not considered to have been\nchanged or transported but to remain one and the same; as long as it\nremains of the same size and shape and maintains the same situation\namong certain external bodies by means of which we specify that space.\n(Pr II 10F)\n\n\nRelative to an arbitrarily chosen set of bodies, it is thus possible\nto refer to the abstract (generic) spatial extension of a portion of\nthe plenum that different extended bodies successively\n\u201coccupy\u201d; and, presumably, by this process of abstraction\nthe internal place of the entire plenum can be likewise constructed.\nDescartes takes a similar view of time, which is judged to be a\ngeneralized abstraction from the \u201cdurations\u201d of particular\nbodies (where duration is an attribute of substance; Pr I\n55\u201357; see Gorham 2007 for more on time in Descartes). Also like\nthe Scholastics, Descartes rejects any form of atomism, which is the\nview that there exists a smallest indivisible particle of matter.\nRather, he holds that since any given spatially extended length is\ndivisible in thought, thus God has the power to actually divide it (Pr\nII 20). The material entities that interact in Descartes\u2019\nphysics come in distinct units or corpuscles (see\n Section 7),\n which explains the \u201ccorpuscularian\u201d title often\nattributed to his mechanical system, but these corpuscles are not\nindivisible.\n\nDescartes\u2019 Principles of Philosophy also presents his\nmost extensive discussion of the phenomena of motion, which is defined\nas \u201cthe transfer of one piece of matter or of one body, from the\nneighborhood of those bodies immediately contiguous to it and\nconsidered at rest, into the neighborhood of others\u201d (Pr II 25).\nDescartes attempts to distinguish his \u201cproper\u201d conception\nof motion, as a change of the \u201cneighborhood\u201d of contiguous\nbodies, from the common or \u201cvulgar\u201d conception of motion,\nwhich is change of internal place (Pr II 10\u201315, 24\u201328).\nThe surface of these containing bodies (that border the contained\nbody) is also called the \u201cexternal place\u201d of the contained\nbody. Descartes notes that the vulgar concept of motion allows a body\nto simultaneously take part in many (possibly contradictory) motions,\nas when a sitting passenger on a ship views himself as at rest\nrelative to the parts of the ship, but not at rest relative to the\nshore (Pr II 24). Yet, when motion is viewed as a translation of the\ncontiguous neighborhood, a body can only partake in one motion, which\ndispels the apparent contradiction (since the body must either be at\nrest, or in translation away from, its contiguous neighborhood).\n\nNevertheless, Descartes\u2019 hypothesis of motion may sanction a\nspecies of relative motion, since his phrase, \u201cconsidered at\nrest\u201d, implies that the choice of which bodies are at rest or in\nmotion is purely arbitrary. According to the \u201crelational\u201d\ntheory (or at least the more strict versions of relationism), space,\ntime, and motion are just relations among bodies, and not separately\nexisting entities or properties that are in any way independent of\nmaterial bodies. Motion only exists as a \u201crelative\ndifference\u201d among bodies: that is, the bodies do not possess\nindividual, determinate properties of speed, velocity, acceleration\n(e.g., body C has the speed property of \u201c5 miles per\nhour\u201d); rather, all that really exists is a difference in their\nrelative speed, velocity, and acceleration (e.g., there is a speed\ndifference among bodies C and B of \u201c5 miles\nper hour\u201d). Several passages in Descartes\u2019 analysis of\nmotion seem to support this strong variety of relationism: \u201cwe\ncannot conceive of the body AB being transported from the\nvicinity of the body CD without also understanding that the\nbody CD is transported from the vicinity of the body\nAB\u201d (Pr II 29). Hence, \u201call the real and positive\nproperties which are in moving bodies, and by virtue of which we say\nthey move, are also found in those [bodies] contiguous to them, even\nthough we consider the second group to be at rest\u201d (Pr II 30).\nThis form of relational motion has been dubbed the \u201creciprocity\nof transfer\u201d in the recent literature. Yet, as will be discussed\nin a later section, Descartes also holds that rest and motion are\ndifferent bodily states, a view that is incompatible with a strict\nrelationism as regards motion. Therefore, Cartesian reciprocity of\ntransfer only satisfies relationism (along with its ban on individual\nbodily states of motion) for moving bodies (i.e., when there is a\ntranslation manifest between a body and its contiguous neighborhood).\nMany of the difficulties associated with Cartesian physics can be\ntraced to the enormous ontological burden that Descartes places on his\nhypothesis of motion. In a later section we will examine the problem\nof integrating his account of motion with the Cartesian laws of\nnature, but a brief discussion of the apparent circularity of\nDescartes\u2019 definitions of motion and body is required at this\npoint. After describing motion as the transference of a body from the\nsurrounding neighborhood of bodies, Descartes states that by\n\u201cone body, or one part of matter, I here understand everything\nwhich is simultaneously transported\u201d (Pr II 25). The problem, of\ncourse, is that Descartes has defined motion as a change of contiguous\nbodies, and then proceeds to define body as that which moves\n(translates, transports). Although this circularity threatens the\nentire edifice of Cartesian physics, it is possible that Descartes\nintended both motion and body to possess an equal ontological\nimportance in his theory, such that neither is the more fundamental\nnotion (which serves as the basis for constructing or defining the\nother notion). Yet, their intrinsic interrelationship entails that any\nattempted definition of one must inevitably incorporate the other. The\nproblem with this reconstruction of Descartes\u2019 reasoning,\nhowever, is that Descartes explicitly deems motion to be a\n\u201cmode\u201d of extension; where a mode is a lesser ontological\ncategory that, roughly, can be understood as a way that extension\nmanifests itself, or as a \u201cproperty\u201d of extension (Pr I\n53; shape is also mentioned as a mode of extension). Finally, another\ndifficulty implicit in Descartes\u2019 theory is the fact that a\nresting body, according to the definition of body and place, would\nseem to \u201cblend\u201d into the surrounding plenum: that is, if a\nbody is \u201ceverything which is simultaneously transported\u201d,\nthen it is not possible to discern a resting body from the surrounding\nplenum matter that forms the external place of that resting body. In\naddition, Descartes rejects any explanation of the solidity of a body\nthat employs a bond among its particles (since the bond itself would\nbe either a substance or property, and thus the solidity of the bond\nwould presumably need to be explained; Pr II 55). A macroscopic\nmaterial body is, essentially, held together just by the relative rest\nof its constituent material parts. This raises the obvious difficulty\nthat the impact of such bodies should result in their dispersion or\ndestruction (for there is nothing to hold them together). These sorts\nof complications prompted many later natural philosophers, who were\ngenerally sympathetic to Descartes\u2019 mechanical philosophy, to\nsearch for an internal property of matter that could serve as a type\nof individuating and constitutive principle for bodies; e.g.,\nLeibniz\u2019 utilization of \u201cforce\u201d.\n\nRelated to the alleged circularity of the definitions of motion and\nbody, as well as the problem of resting bodies, is the difficulty in\nreconciling Descartes\u2019 definition of \u201csubstance\u201d\nwith his claim that individual bodies are substances. If, as Descartes\nbelieves, substances are not dependent on other things in order to\nexist (Pr I 51), then any part of extension (which is a body, via Pr\nII 10, as explained above) would not qualify as a substance since it\ndepend on its contiguous neighbors to delimit and define its boundary.\nYet, Descartes often declares that individual bodies are substances;\ne.g., \u201cthe two halves of a portion of matter, no matter how\nsmall they may be, are two complete substances\u201d (AT III 447).\nOne of the most popular replies to this difficulty, from Spinoza\n(Ethics, Part I, Prop. 15) to many contemporary commentators\n(e.g., Keeling 1968, Lennon 1993, Sowaal 2004, Schmaltz 2020, and\nnumerous others), is to declare that only the whole plenum is a\nsubstance, and not any of its constituent parts. The problem with this\nattempted solution, however, is that it lacks textual support, as is\nevident in the Pr I 51 quotation above. Likewise, some of these\nreconstructions, such as Lennon\u2019s, would seem to violate central\naspects of Cartesian physics and metaphysics, for he interprets motion\nas a phenomenal contribution of the mind, such that the plenum and its\nparts do not move or change at all. Along these same lines, some\nscholars (e.g., Schaffer 2009) have concluded that Descartes was a\nsupersubstantivalist, i.e., the view that space (spacetime, in the\nmodern setting) is the only predicable or fundamental substance. While\nDescartes\u2019 identification of corporeal substance and space (see\nabove, Pr II 10) might seem to support this reading,\nsupersubstantivalism takes space as primary, and matter as secondary\nor derived from space (see Sklar 1974, 222). Descartes, on the\ncontrary, takes matter or body as primary and space as a derived,\nabstract concept: \u201cthe same extension which constitutes the\nnature of body also constitutes the nature of space, and . . . these\ntwo things differ only in the way that the nature of the genus or\nspecies differs from that of the individual\u201d (Pr II 11). Whereas\nspace is a genus or species concept for Descartes (which is a\nuniversal; Pr I 59), space is the individual for the\nsupersubstantivalist, and thus ascribing supersubstantivalism to\nDescartes violates his nominalism (Pr II 8). Indeed, the reason that\nDescartes seeks to equate bodily and spatial extension in this part of\nthe Principles is that he strives to reject any view that\ntreats space as a separate, usually incorporeal, entity that is\nindependent of matter (e.g., the popular imaginary space tradition,\nwhich was a forerunner to the absolutist or substantivalist\nconception): \u201cThat corporeal substance, when distinguished from\nits quantity or extension, is confusedly conceived as if it were\nincorporeal\u201d (Pr II 9).\n",
