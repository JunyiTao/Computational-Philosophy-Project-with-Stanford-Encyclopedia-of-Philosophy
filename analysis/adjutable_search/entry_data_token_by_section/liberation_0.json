    "main_text": "History\n1. History\n\nAs was noted, the philosophy of liberation belongs to the\n\u201cmaturity\u201d stage of the \u201ccontemporary\u201d period\nof the history of Latin American philosophy (Gracia and Vargas 2013;\nGracia 1988\u201389). As a philosophical movement that engages in the\ncritical task of recovering what is distinctly \u201cLatin\nAmerican\u201d thought, it has sought explicitly to unearth and\nrescue Amerindian thought, in its pre-Colombian and post-Conquest\nforms, as well as all the different philosophical tendencies and\nmovements that emerged during the long history of colonialism,\nindependence and projects of national formation. It is for this reason\nthat the philosophy of liberation has as one of its goals a critical\nhistoriography of Latin American thought, specifically, and philosophy\ntout court, in general. Figures such as Enrique Dussel,\nRodolfo Kusch, Arturo Roig, and Leopoldo Zea have articulated their\nversions of the philosophy of liberation in terms of a recovery of\nearlier stages in the formulation of a project of Latin American\nliberation. Yet, the philosophy of liberation as a self-conscious\nmovement and current, emerged out of a very distinct convergence of\ngeo-historical, cultural, intellectual and philosophical tendencies,\nconflicts and processes.\n",
