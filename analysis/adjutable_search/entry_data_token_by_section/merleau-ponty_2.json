Phenomenology of Perception\n\nCompleted in 1944 and published the following year, Phenomenology\nof Perception (PP) is the work for which Merleau-Ponty was best\nknown during his lifetime and that established him as the leading\nFrench phenomenologist of his generation. Here Merleau-Ponty develops\nhis own distinctive interpretation of phenomenology\u2019s method,\ninformed by his new familiarity with Husserl\u2019s unpublished\nmanuscripts and his deepened engagement with other thinkers in this\ntradition, such as Eugen Fink and Martin Heidegger. Phenomenology\nof Perception again draws extensively on Gestalt theory and\ncontemporary research in psychology and neurology; the case of\nSchneider, a brain-damaged patient studied by Adh\u00e9mar Gelb and\nKurt Goldstein, serves as an extended case-study. Psychological\nresearch complements and, at times, serves as a counterpoint to\nphenomenological descriptions of perceptual experience across a wide\nrange of existential dimensions, including sexuality, language, space,\nnature, intersubjectivity, time, and freedom. In\nPhenomenology, Merleau-Ponty develops a characteristic rhythm\nof presenting, first, the realist or empiricist approach to a\nparticular dimension of experience, followed then by its idealist or\nintellectualist alternative, before developing a third way that avoids\nthe problematic assumption common to both, namely, their\n\u201cunquestioned belief in the world\u201d: the prejudice that the\nobjective world exists as a ready-made and fully present reality.\n\nThe Preface to Phenomenology of Perception, completed after\nthe main text, offers Merleau-Ponty\u2019s most detailed and\nsystematic exposition of the phenomenological method. His account is\norganized around four themes: the privileging of description over\nscientific explanation or idealist reconstruction, the\nphenomenological reduction, the eidetic reduction, and intentionality.\nIn order to describe faithfully our pre-reflective engagement with the\nworld, phenomenology first sets aside all scientific or naturalistic\nexplanations of phenomena. Such explanations attempt to reconstruct\nthe experience of the world, which they inevitably presuppose, by\nmeans of causal mechanisms. In parallel, phenomenology also avoids\nreconstructing actual experience in idealist terms, that is, by its\nconditions of possibility or the activity of consciousness. The\n\u201creflective analysis\u201d employed by Descartes and Kant, for\ninstance, by replacing the world with the synthesizing acts of\nconsciousness, thereby obscures the fact that the world exists prior\nto any conscious act or judgment. Rather than reconstructing the world\nin terms of the conditions of possible experience,\nphenomenology must explore the conditions of actual\nexperience, which are not reducible to conscious judgments or\nrepresentations. Consequently, the phenomenological reduction, on\nMerleau-Ponty's interpretation, is neither a naturalistic nor an\nidealist method but an existential one, namely, the reflective effort\nto describe our pre-reflective engagement with the world without\nreducing this engagement either to causal events or to conscious acts.\nThrough the process of the reduction, we discover the inherence of the\none who reflects in the world that is reflected on, and consequently,\nthe essentially incomplete character of every act of reflection, which\nis why Merleau-Ponty claims that the \u201cmost important lesson of\nthe reduction is the impossibility of a complete reduction\u201d (PP:\n14/lxxvii). Similarly, the \u201ceidetic reduction\u201d, described\nby Husserl as the intuition of essential relations within the flux of\nconscious experience, is necessary if phenomenology is to make any\ndescriptive claims that go beyond the brute facts of a particular\nexperience. But this does not found the actual world on consciousness\nas the condition of the world\u2019s possibility; instead, \u201cthe\neidetic method is that of a phenomenological positivism grounding the\npossible upon the real\u201d (PP: 17/lxxxi). Lastly, Merleau-Ponty\nreinterprets the phenomenological concept of intentionality,\ntraditionally understood as the recognition that all consciousness is\nconsciousness of something. Following Husserl, he\ndistinguishes the \u201cact intentionality\u201d of judgments and\nvoluntary decisions from the \u201coperative intentionality\u201d\nthat \u201cestablishes the natural and pre-predicative unity of the\nworld and of our life\u201d (PP: 18/lxxxii). Guided by this broader\nconcept of intentionality, philosophy\u2019s task is to take in the\n\u201ctotal intention\u201d of a sensible thing, a philosophical\ntheory, or an historical event, which is its \u201cunique manner of\nexisting\u201d or its \u201cexistential structure\u201d (PP:\n19\u201320/lxxxii\u2013lxxxiii). Phenomenology thereby expresses the\nemergence of reason and meaning in a contingent world, a creative task\ncomparable to that of the artist or the political activist, which\nrequires an ongoing \u201cradical\u201d or self-referential\nreflection on its own possibilities. On Merleau-Ponty\u2019s\npresentation, the tensions of phenomenology\u2019s method therefore\nreflect the nature of its task:\n\n\nThe unfinished nature of phenomenology and the inchoative style in\nwhich it proceeds are not the sign of failure, they were inevitable\nbecause phenomenology\u2019s task was to reveal the mystery of the\nworld and the mystery of reason. (PP: 21\u201322/lxxxv)\n\n\nPhenomenology of Perception introduces its primary inquiry\nwith a critique of the \u201cclassical prejudices\u201d of\nempiricism and intellectualism. Merleau-Ponty rejects the empiricist\nunderstanding of sensation, with its correlative \u201cconstancy\nhypothesis\u201d, and the role empiricism grants to association and\nthe projection of memory for treating the basic units of sensation as\ndeterminate atoms rather than as meaningful wholes. These wholes\ninclude ambiguities, indeterminacies, and contextual relations that\ndefy explanation in terms of the causal action of determinate things.\nIntellectualism aims to provide an alternative to empiricism by\nintroducing judgment or attention as mental activities that synthesize\nexperience from the sensory givens, yet it adopts empiricism\u2019s\nstarting point in dispersed, atomic sensations. Both approaches are\nguilty of reading the results of perception (the objective world) back\ninto perceptual experience, thereby falsifying perception\u2019s\ncharacteristic structure: the spontaneous organization or\nconfiguration of perceived phenomena themselves, with their\nindeterminacies and ambiguities, and the dynamic character of\nperception as an historical process involving development and\ntransformation. By treating perception as a causal process of\ntransmission or a cognitive judgment, empiricism and intellectualism\ndeny any meaningful configuration to the perceived as such and treat\nall values and meanings as projections, leaving no basis in perception\nitself for distinguishing the true from the illusory.\n\nIn contrast, Merleau-Ponty argues that the basic level of perceptual\nexperience is the gestalt, the meaningful whole of figure against\nground, and that the indeterminate and contextual aspects of the\nperceived world are positive phenomenon that cannot be eliminated from\na complete account. Sensing, in distinction from knowing, is a\n\u201cliving communication with the world that makes it present to us\nas the familiar place of our life\u201d (PP: 79/53), investing the\nperceived world with meanings and values that refer essentially to our\nbodies and lives. We fail to notive this \u201cphenomenal\nfield\u201d, the world as it appears directly to perception, as a\nconsequence of perception\u2019s own tendency to forget itself in\nfavor of the perceived that it discloses. Perception orients itself\ntoward the truth, placing its faith in the eventual convergence of\nperspectives and progressive determination of what was previously\nindeterminate. But it thereby naturally projects a completed and\ninvariant \u201ctruth in itself\u201d as its goal. Science extends\nand amplifies this natural tendency through increasingly precise\nmeasurements of the invariants in perception, leading eventually to\nthe theoretical construction of an objective world of determinate\nthings. Once this determinism of the \u201cin itself\u201d is\nextended universally and applied even to the body and the perceptual\nrelation itself, then its ongoing dependence on the \u201coriginary\nfaith\u201d of perception is obscured; perception is reduced to\n\u201cconfused appearances\u201d that require methodical\nreinterpretation, and the eventual result is dualism, solipsism, and\nskepticism. The \u201cfundamental philosophical act\u201d would\ntherefore be to \u201creturn to the lived world beneath the objective\nworld\u201d (PP: 83/57). This requires a transcendental reduction: a\nreversal of perception\u2019s natural tendency to cover its own\ntracks and a bracketing of our unquestioned belief in the objective\nworld. Yet this cannot be a recourse to any transcendental\nconsciousness that looks on the world from outside and is not itself\nemergent from and conditioned by the phenomenal field. Rather than a\ntranscendental ego, Merleau-Ponty speaks of a \u201ctranscendental\nfield\u201d, emphasizing that reflection always has a situated and\npartial perspective as a consequence of being located within the field\non which it reflects.\n\nThe first of the three major parts of Phenomenology concerns\nthe body. As we have seen, perception transcends itself toward a\ndeterminate object \u201cin itself\u201d, culminating in an\nobjective interpretation of the body. Part One shows the limits of\nthis objective account and sketches an alternative understanding of\nthe body across a series of domains, including the experience of\none\u2019s own body, lived space, sexuality, and language. Through a\ncontrast with pathological cases such as phantom limbs, Merleau-Ponty\ndescribes the body\u2019s typical mode of existence as\n\u201cbeing-toward-the-world\u201d\u2014a pre-objective orientation\ntoward a vital situation that is explicable neither in terms of\nthird-person causal interactions nor by explicit judgments or\nrepresentations. The body\u2019s orientation toward the world is\nessentially temporal, involving a dialectic between the present body\n(characterized, after Husserl, as an \u201cI can\u201d) and the\nhabit body, the sedimentations of past activities that take on a\ngeneral, anonymous, and autonomous character. While the body\u2019s\nrelation to the world serves as the essential background for the\nexperience of any particular thing, the body itself is experienced in\nways that distinguish it in kind from all other things: it is a\npermanent part of one\u2019s perceptual field, even though one cannot\nin principle experience all of it directly; it has \u201cdouble\nsensations\u201d, such as when one hand touches another, that enact a\nform of reflexivity; it has affective experiences that are not merely\nrepresentations; and its kinesthetic sense of its own movements is\ngiven directly.\n\nThis kinesthetic awareness is made possible by a pre-conscious system\nof bodily movements and spatial equivalences that Merleau-Ponty terms\nthe \u201cbody schema\u201d. In contrast with the \u201cpositional\nspatiality\u201d of things, the body has a \u201csituational\nspatiality\u201d that is oriented toward actual or possible tasks\n(PP: 129/102). The body\u2019s existence as\n\u201cbeing-toward-the-world\u201d, as a projection toward lived\ngoals, is therefore expressed through its spatiality, which forms the\nbackground against which objective space is constituted. Merleau-Ponty\nintroduces here the famous case of Schneider, whose reliance on\npathological substitutions for normal spatial abilities helps to bring\nthe body\u2019s typical relationship with lived space to light.\nSchneider lacks the ability to \u201cproject\u201d into virtual\nspace; more generally, his injury has disrupted the \u201cintentional\narc\u201d that\n\n\nprojects around us our past, our future, our human milieu, our\nphysical situation, our ideological situation, and our moral\nsituation, or rather, that ensures that we are situated within all of\nthese relationships. (PP: 170/137)\n\n\nThe body\u2019s relationship with space is therefore intentional,\nalthough as an \u201cI can\u201d rather than an \u201cI\nthink\u201d; bodily space is a multi-layered manner of relating to\nthings, so that the body is not \u201cin\u201d space but lives or\ninhabits it.\n\nJust as bodily space reflects an originary form of\nintentionality\u2014a pre-cognitive encounter with the world as\nmeaningfully structured\u2014the same is shown to be the case for\nsexuality and for language. Sexuality takes on a special significance\nbecause it essentially expresses the metaphysical drama of the human\ncondition while infusing the atmosphere of our lives with sexual\nsignificance. Like space and sexuality, speech is also a form of\nbodily expression. Language does not initially encode ready-made\nthoughts but rather expresses through its style or physiognomy as a\nbodily gesture. We mistake language for a determined code by taking\nhabitual or sedimented language as our model, thereby missing\n\u201cauthentic\u201d or creative speech. Since language, like\nperception, hides its own operations in carrying us toward its\nmeaning, it offers an ideal of truth as its presumptive limit,\ninspiring our traditional privileging of thought or reason as\ndetachable from all materiality. But, at a fundamental level, language\nis comparable to music in the way that it remains tied to its material\nembodiment; each language is a distinct and ultimately untranslatable\nmanner of \u201csinging the world\u201d, of extracting and\nexpressing the \u201cemotional essence\u201d of our surroundings and\nrelationships (PP: 228/193).\n\nHaving rediscovered the body as expressive and intentional,\nMerleau-Ponty turns in Part Two of Phenomenology to the\nperceived world, with the aim of showing how the pre-reflective unity\nof co-existence that characterizes the body has as its correlate the\nsynthesis of things and the world; \u201cOne\u2019s own body is in\nthe world just as the heart is in the organism\u201d (PP: 245/209),\nand its expressive unity therefore also extends to the sensible world.\nMerleau-Ponty develops this interpretation of the sensible through\ndetailed studies of sensing, space, and the natural and social worlds.\nSensing takes place as the \u201cco-existence\u201d or\n\u201ccommunion\u201d of the body with the world that Merleau-Ponty\ndescribes as a reciprocal exchange of question and answer:\n\n\na sensible that is about to be sensed poses to my body a sort of\nconfused problem. I must find the attitude that will provide\nit with the means to become determinate \u2026 I must find the\nresponse to a poorly formulated question. And yet I only do this in\nresponse to its solicitation\u2026 . The sensible gives back to me\nwhat I had lent to it, but I received it from the sensible in the\nfirst place. (PP: 259/222)\n\n\nAs co-existence, sensing is characterized by an intentionality that\nsympathetically attunes itself to the sensed according to a dialectic\nin which both terms\u2014the perceiving body and the perceived\nthing\u2014are equally active and receptive: the thing invites the\nbody to adopt the attitude that will lead to its disclosure. Since the\nsubject of this perception is not the idealist\u2019s \u201cfor\nitself\u201d, neither is the object of perception the realist\u2019s\n\u201cin itself\u201d; rather, the agent of perception is the\npre-reflective and anonymous subjectivity of the body, which remains\nenmeshed in and \u201cconnatural\u201d with the world that it\nperceives. The senses are unified without losing their distinctness in\na fashion comparable to the binocular synthesis of vision, and their\nanonymity is a consequence of the \u201chistorical thickness\u201d\nof perception as a tradition that operates beneath the level of\nreflective consciousness (PP: 285/248). For first-person awareness,\none\u2019s anonymous perceptual engagement with the world operates as\na kind of \u201coriginal past, a past that has never been\npresent\u201d (PP: 252/252).\n\nThe pre-historical pact between the body and the world informs our\nencounters with space, revealing a synthesis of space that is neither\n\u201cspatialized\u201d (as a pre-given container in which things\nare arranged) nor \u201cspatializing\u201d (like the homogenous and\ninterchangeable relations of geometrical space). Drawing on\npsychological experiments concerning bodily orientation, depth, and\nmovement, Merleau-Ponty argues that empiricist and intellectualist\naccounts of space must give way to a conception of space as\nco-existence or mutual implication characterized by existential\n\u201clevels\u201d: our orientation toward up and down, or toward\nwhat is in motion or stationary, is a function of the body\u2019s\nadoption of a certain level within a revisable field of possibilities.\nLived inherence in space contrasts with the abstract space of the\nanalytical attitude, revindicating the existential space of night,\ndreams, or myths in relation to the abstract space of the\n\u201cobjective\u201d world.\n\nThe properties of things that we take to be \u201creal\u201d and\n\u201cobjective\u201d also tacitly assume a reference to the\nbody\u2019s norms and its adoption of levels. An object\u2019s\n\u201ctrue\u201d qualities depend on the body\u2019s privileging of\norientations that yield maximum clarity and richness. This is possible\nbecause the body serves as a template for the style or logic of the\nworld, the concordant system of relations that links the qualities of\nan object, the configuration of the perceptual field, and background\nlevels such as lighting or movement. In this symbiosis or\ncall-and-response between the body and the world, things have sense as\nthe correlates of one\u2019s body, and reality therefore always\ninvolves a reference to perception. Yet, to be real, things cannot be\nreducible to correlates of the body or perception; they retain a depth\nand resistance that provides their existential index. While each thing\nhas its individual style, the world is the ultimate horizon or\nbackground style against which any particular thing can appear. The\nperspectival limitations of perception, both spatially and temporally,\nare the obverse of this world\u2019s depth and inexhaustibility.\nThrough an examination of hallucination and illusions, Merleau-Ponty\nargues that skepticism about the existence of the world makes a\ncategory mistake. While we can doubt any particular perception,\nillusions can appear only against the background of the world and our\nprimordial faith in it. While we never coincide with the world or\ngrasp it with absolute certainty, we are also never entirely cut off\nfrom it; perception essentially aims toward truth, but any truth that\nit reveals is contingent and revisable.\n\nRejecting analogical explanations for the experience of other people,\nMerleau-Ponty proposes that the rediscovery of the body as a\n\u201cthird genre of being between the pure subject and the\nobject\u201d makes possible encounters with embodied others (PP:\n407/366). We perceive others directly as pre-personal and embodied\nliving beings engaged with a world that we share in common. This\nencounter at the level of anonymous and pre-personal lives does not,\nhowever, present us with another person in the full sense, since our\nsituations are never entirely congruent. The perception of others\ninvolves an alterity, a resistance, and a plenitude that are never\nreducible to what is presented, which is the truth of solipsism. Our\ncommon corporeality nevertheless opens us onto a shared social world,\na permanent dimension of our being in the mode of the anonymous and\ngeneral \u201csomeone\u201d. The perception of others is therefore a\nprivileged example of the paradox of transcendence running through our\nencounter with the world as perceived:\n\n\nWhether it is a question of my body, the natural world, the past,\nbirth or death, the question is always to know how I can be open to\nphenomena that transcend me and that, nevertheless, only exist to the\nextent that I take them up and live them. (PP: 422/381)\n\n\nThis \u201cfundamental contradiction\u201d defines our encounters\nwith every form of transcendence and requires new conceptions of\nconsciousness, time, and freedom.\n\nThe fourth and final section of Phenomenology explores these\nthree themes, starting with a revision of the concept of the cogito\nthat avoids reducing it to merely episodic psychological fact or\nelevating it to a universal certainty of myself and my\ncogitationes. Merleau-Ponty argues that we cannot separate\nthe certainty of our thoughts from that of our perceptions, since to\ntruly perceive is to have confidence in the veracity of one\u2019s\nperceptions. Furthermore, we are not transparent to ourselves, since\nour \u201cinner states\u201d are available to us only in a situated\nand ambiguous way. The genuine cogito, Merleau-Ponty argues, is a\ncogito \u201cin action\u201d: we do not deduce \u201cI am\u201d\nfrom \u201cI think\u201d, but rather the certainty of \u201cI\nthink\u201d rests on the \u201cI am\u201d of existential\nengagement. More basic than explicit self-consciousness and\npresupposed by it is an ambiguous mode of self-experience that\nMerleau-Ponty terms the silent or \u201ctacit\u201d cogito\u2014our\npre-reflective and inarticulate grasp on the world and ourselves that\nbecomes explicit and determinate only when it finds expression for\nitself. The illusions of pure self-possession and\ntransparency\u2014like all apparently \u201ceternal\u201d\ntruths\u2014are the results of acquired or sedimented language and\nconcepts.\n\nRejecting classic approaches to time that treat it either as an\nobjective property of things, as a psychological content, or as the\nproduct of transcendental consciousness, Merleau-Ponty returns to the\n\u201cfield of presence\u201d as our foundational experience of\ntime. This field is a network of intentional relations, of\n\u201cprotentions\u201d and \u201cretentions\u201d, in a single\nmovement of dehiscence or self-differentiation, such that \u201ceach\npresent reaffirms the presence of the entire past that it drives away,\nand anticipates the presence of the entire future or the\n\u2018to-come\u2019\u201d (PP: 483/444). Time in this sense is\n\u201cultimate subjectivity\u201d, understood not as an eternal\nconsciousness, but rather as the very act of temporalization. As with\nthe tacit cogito, the auto-affection of time as ultimate subjectivity\nis not a static self-identity but involves a dynamic opening toward\nalterity. In this conception of time as field of presence, which\n\u201creveals the subject and the object as two abstract moments of a\nunique structure, namely, presence\u201d (PP:\n494/454\u201355), Merleau-Ponty sees the resolution to all problems\nof transcendence as well as the foundation for human freedom. Against\nthe Sartrean position that freedom is either total or null,\nMerleau-Ponty holds that freedom emerges only against the background\nof our \u201cuniversal engagement in a world\u201d, which involves\nus in meanings and values that are not of our choosing. We must\nrecognize, first, an \u201cauthochthonous sense of the world that is\nconstituted in the exchange between the world and our embodied\nexistence\u201d (PP: 504/466), and, second, that the acquired habits\nand the sedimented choices of our lives have their own inertia. This\nsituation does not eliminate freedom but is precisely the field in\nwhich it can be achieved. Taking class consciousness as his example,\nMerleau-Ponty proposes that this dialectic of freedom and acquisition\nprovides the terms for an account of history, according to which\nhistory can develop a meaning and a direction that are neither\ndetermined by events nor necessarily transparent to those who live\nthrough it.\n",
