That is,\nthe prices of goods and services are set by the aggregate forces of\nsupply and demand; no individual buys or sells a good for anything\nother than the market price. In reality, things are different. Sellers\nof goods have some flexibility about how to price goods.\n\nMost business ethicists would accept that, in most cases, the prices\nat which products should be sold is a matter for private individuals\nto decide. This view has been defended on grounds of property rights.\nSome claim that if I have a right to a thing, then I am free to\ntransfer that thing to you on whatever terms that I propose and you\naccept (Boatright 2010). It has also been defended on grounds of\nwelfare. Prices set by voluntary exchanges reveal valuable information\nabout the relative demand for and supply of goods, allowing resources\nto flow to their most productive uses (Hayek 1945). Despite this, most\nbusiness ethicists also recognize some limits on prices.\n\nOne issue that has received increasing attention is price\ndiscrimination. This is discrimination based on willingness to pay, or\nthe practice of charging more to people who are willing to pay more.\nThis might at first seem unfair or even exploitative, but in fact it\nis commonplace and usually unremarkable (Elegido 2011; Marcoux 2006a).\nExamples of price discrimination include senior and student discounts,\nbulk discounts, versioning, and the sort of bargaining one finds in\ncar dealerships and flea markets. We might see price discrimination as\nan implication of freedom in pricing, and according to a familiar\nresult in economics, price discrimination increases social welfare,\nprovided that it enables producers to increase output (Varian 1985).\nBut some instances of price discrimination have come in for criticism.\nOnline retailers collect and purchase enormous amounts of information\nabout consumers, and there is evidence that they are using this to\npersonalize prices, or tailor prices to what they think are\nconsumers\u2019 reservation prices, i.e., the highest amounts they\nare willing to pay. Some believe that this practice is unfair\n(Steinberg 2020), though they problem may simply be that consumers\ndon\u2019t know what retailers are up to.\n\nAnother issue of pricing ethics is price gouging. Price gouging can be\nunderstood as a sharp increase in the price of a necessary good in the\nwake of an emergency which renders that good scarce (Hughes 2020;\nZwolinski 2008). As the novel coronavirus spread around the world in\nearly 2020, retailers began to charge extremely high prices for\ncleaning products and medical supplies. Many jurisdictions have laws\nagainst price gouging, and it is widely regarded as unethical (Snyder\n2009). The reason is that it is a paradigm case of exploitation:\nA extracts an excessive benefit out of B in\ncircumstances in which B cannot reasonably refuse\nA\u2019s offer (Valdman 2009). But some theorists defend\nprice gouging. While granting that sales of items in circumstances\nlike these are exploitative, they note that they are mutually\nbeneficial. Both the seller and buyer prefer to engage in the\ntransaction rather than not engage in it. Moreover, when items are\nsold at inflated prices, this both limits hoarding and attracts more\nsellers into the market. Permitting price gouging may thus be the\nfastest way of eliminating it (Zwolinski 2008). (For further\ndiscussion, see the entry on\n exploitation.)\n\nMost contemporary scholars believe that sellers have wide, though not\nunlimited, discretion in how much they charge for goods and services.\nBut there is an older tradition in business ethics, found in Aquinas\nand other medieval scholars, according to which there is one price\nthat sellers should charge: the \u201cjust price\u201d. There is\ndebate about what exactly medieval scholars meant by \u201cjust\nprice\u201d. According to a historically common interpretation, the\njust price is determined by the seller\u2019s cost of production,\ni.e., the price that compensates the seller for the value of her labor\nand expenses. More recent interpretations understand the medieval just\nprice at something closer to the market price, which may be more or\nless than the cost of production (Koehn & Wilbratte 2012).\n",
