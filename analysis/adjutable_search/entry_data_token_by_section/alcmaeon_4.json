    "main_text": "Epistemology and Psychology || The Limits of Knowledge\n2.1 The Limits of Knowledge\n\nAlcmaeon began his book by defining the limits of human knowledge:\n\nConcerning things that are not perceptible [concerning mortal things]\nthe gods have clarity, but insofar as it is possible for human beings\nto judge (tekmairesthai) \u2026 (DK, B1)\n\n\nSuch skepticism about human knowledge is characteristic of one strand\nof early Greek thought. Both Alcmaeon\u2019s predecessors (e.g.,\nXenophanes B34) and his successors (e.g., Philolaus B6) made similar\ncontrasts between divine and human knowledge, but in Alcmaeon\u2019s\ncase, as in these other cases, we do not have enough evidence to be\nsure what he intended. Most of the subjects that Alcmaeon went on to\ndiscuss in his book could not be settled by a direct appeal to sense\nperception (e.g., the functioning of the senses, the balance of\nopposites in the healthy body, the immortality of the soul). In this\nsense he was dealing largely with what is \u201cnot\nperceptible\u201d (aphanes). Alcmaeon is decidedly not an\nextreme skeptic, however, in that he is willing to assign clear\nunderstanding about such things to the gods and by implication admits\nthat even humans have clear understanding of what is directly\nperceptible. Moreover, while humans cannot attain clarity about what\ncannot be perceived, Alcmaeon thinks that they can make reasonable\njudgments from the signs that are presented to them by sensation\n(tekmairesthai). He thus takes the stance of the scientist\nwho draws inferences from what can be perceived, and he implicitly\nrejects the claims of those who base their account of the world on the\ncertainty of a divine revelation (e.g., Pythagoras, Parmenides\nB1).\n\nThere are difficulties with the text of Fr. 1, which make its\ninterpretation problematic. Some scholars exclude the material in\nbrackets above because it is hard to see how to connect it to what\nprecedes (e.g., Wachtler 1896), while others keep the material and\nsuppose that we are to understand an \u201cand\u201d coordinating\nthe phrase in brackets with what precedes it (e.g., DK 1952). Other\nscholars would place a semicolon or colon after \u201cthings that are\nnot perceptible\u201d so that up to the colon Alcmaeon is identifying\nhis topic or the area of disagreement with this addressees, while\nafter the colon he begins his own account (Kouloumentas 2018 following\nGomperz). Gemelli Marciano (2007, 18\u201322), on the other hand, has\nsuggested that the material in brackets above should be kept but made\ndependent on the immediately preceding phrase rather than coordinated\nwith it, so that the fragment would read:\n\nConcerning things that are not perceptible concerning mortals the gods\nhave clarity, but insofar as it is possible for human beings to judge\n\u2026 (DK, B1)\n\n\nIf we regard Alcmaeon as primarily a doctor or medical thinker, rather\nthan as a cosmologist, \u201cthings that are not perceptible\nconcerning mortals\u201d is likely to refer to the interior of the\nbody and hidden diseases. Passages in the Greek medical writings of\nthe fifth century provide clear parallels for the difficulty of\nknowing about the interior of the body and invisible maladies (Gemelli\nMarciano 2007, 20\u201321). On this reading Fr.1 is addressed to\nmedical students. Parallels with medical treatises suggest that, after\nfirst raising difficulties about medical knowledge in these matters,\nAlcmaeon may have gone on to assert that these difficulties can be\novercome with the proper teaching, the teaching that followed in his\nbook. If this is the correct context in which to read the fragment, it\nis not so much about the limits of understanding as the success of\nmedical teaching in overcoming apparent limits.\n",
