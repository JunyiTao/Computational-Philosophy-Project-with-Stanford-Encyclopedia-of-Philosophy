    "main_text": "Pyrrhonian Skepticism || Early Figures: Pyrrho and Timon\n4.1 Early Figures: Pyrrho and Timon\n\nWhen comparing Pyrrhonian and Academic skepticism, two topics stand\nout: Pyrrhonism aims at tranquility; and it assigns pride of place to\nappearances. Anecdotes about Pyrrho\u2019s life (365/60\u2013275/70\nBC) convey how unaffected he was (DL 9.61\u201369). This kind of\nideal\u2014a tranquil state of mind\u2014is not part of Academic\nskepticism, and scholars disagree on its role in Pyrrhonism\n(Machuca 2006; Striker 2010; Perin 2020; on Democritean\ninfluences on tranquility in Pyrrho and Timon, cf. Svavarsson 2013).\nInsofar as the point of the anecdotes about Pyrrho\u2019s life is\nthat Pyrrho did not avoid or pursue anything with fervor, or that he\ndid not despair about things that other people find terrible, they\ncapture ideas that remain central to Pyrrhonism (for a general account\nof early Pyrrhonism, cf. Castagnoli 2013; on Sextus\u2019 take\non Pyrrhonian tranquility, cf. Svavarsson 2015).\n\nThe biographical anecdotes portray Pyrrho as a strikingly\nunconventional figure, unaffected not just by emotion and belief, but\nalso by perception\u2014to the extent that friends had to pull him\noff the street when a wagon approached (DL 9.62). At the same time,\nPyrrho seems to have said that the skeptic adheres to appearances\n(phainomena) (DL 9.106; Bett 2000, 84\u201393; on earlier\nnotions of appearances relevant to skepticism, cf. Barney 1992). This\nmight suggest that he would not cross the street when a wagon is\napproaching, and so appears to him. One story makes Pyrrho appear\nnot only unusual, but arguably a not so sympathetic character. Passing\nby a drowning man, he was so unmoved that he simply walked on (DL\n9.63). This is in rather stark contrast with Stoic notions of\nunaffectedness, where the idea would be that, not being disturbed by\nemotions like fear and panic, the passerby is ideally equipped to help\neffectively. Some biographical details can seem to mold\nPyrrho\u2019s life to fit the schema of the sage: a traveler to the\nEast (Flintoff 1980), whose insights are conveyed in brief sayings; an\nenigmatic figure, exemplary and shocking at the same time. Though it\nis difficult to assess the testimony on Pyrrho\u2019s travels,\nscholars increasingly explore resonances between Pyrrho\u2019s\npronouncements, later Pyrrhonian skepticism, and dimensions of\nBuddhist philosophy (Hanner 2020). For example, Mill (2018) argues\nthat a tradition in classical Indian philosophy develops a\n\u201cskepticism about philosophy\u201d that resembles dimensions of\nPyrrhonian thought.\n\nEven though he discussed tranquility and adherence to appearances,\nPyrrho was arguably no Pyrrhonian skeptic (Bett 2000, 14\u201362).\nThat is, it is likely that he put forward a dogmatic position, in the\nsense that he had positive philosophical views about the character of\nreality. Pyrrho wrote nothing. Much of what we know about him is\npreserved through the writings of Timon, his adherent\n(325/20\u2013235/30 BCE) (Burnyeat 1980b; Clayman 2009). The\nmost important piece of testimony is a passage reporting an account by\nTimon:\n\nIt is necessary above all to consider our own knowledge; for if it is\nin our nature to know nothing, there is no need to inquire any further\ninto other things. [\u2026] Pyrrho of Elis was also a powerful\nadvocate of such a position. He himself has left nothing in writing;\nhis pupil Timon, however, says that the person who is to be happy must\nlook to these three points: first, what are things like by nature?\nsecond, in what way ought we to be disposed towards them? and finally,\nwhat will be the result for those who are so disposed? He [Timon] says\nthat he [Pyrrho] reveals that things are equally indifferent and\nunstable and indeterminate (adiaphora kai astathm\u00eata kai\nanepikrita); for this reason, neither our perceptions nor our\nbeliefs tell the truth or lie (adoxastous kai aklineis kai\nakradantous). For this reason, then, we should not trust them,\nbut should be without opinions and without inclinations and without\nwavering, saying about each single thing that it no more is than is\nnot, or both is and is not, or neither is nor is not (ou mallon\nestin \u00ea ouk estin \u00ea kai esti kai ouk estin\n\u00ea oute estin oute ouk estin). Timon says that the result\nfor those who are so disposed will be first speechlessness\n(aphasia), but then freedom from worry (ataraxia);\nand Aenesidemus says pleasure. These, then, are the main points of\nwhat they say (Aristocles in Eusebius PE 14.18.1\u20135 =\nDC53; tr. Bett 2000 with changes)\n\n\nIn response to the first question, how things are in their nature,\nPyrrho makes a metaphysical claim: they are indeterminate (Bett 2000,\n14\u201329). There are no stable items, or no items with stable\nproperties. Scholars sometimes hesitate to ascribe such a position to\nPyrrho, because it is undoubtedly dogmatic. Perhaps the text can be\ngiven an epistemological reading: things are indifferentiable and\nunmeasurable and undecidable, because we fail in differentiating,\nmeasuring, and determining how they are (Svavarsson 2010; Thorsrud\n2010). But Pyrrho\u2019s response to the second question may only\nfollow if we adopt the metaphysical reading (Bett 2000, 29\u201337).\nPyrrho infers that our perceptions and beliefs are neither true nor\nfalse. They are not truth-evaluable, presumably because there are no\nfacts which could be correctly captured. Third, if we understand these\nthings, speechlessness (aphasia) follows, and then\ntranquility (ataraxia). Pyrrho does not say that we should\ncease to speak. He suggests that we adopt a complicated mode of\nspeech, constructed around the expression ou mallon\n(\u201cno more\u201d), which aims to capture the indeterminate\nnatures of things, when we attempt to say anything about anything\n(Bett 2000, 37\u201339; Vogt 2021).\n",
