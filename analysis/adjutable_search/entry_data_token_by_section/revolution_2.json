    "main_text": "Revolutionary Jus ad Bellum\n3. Revolutionary Jus ad Bellum\n\nContemporary just war theory provides a sophisticated framework for\nassessing the morality of political revolution (see the entry on\n war).\n Just war theory is relevant because revolutions typically involve the\nlarge-scale use of force, both by revolutionaries and by the regime\nthat attempts to thwart their efforts. Locke\u2019s argument in\nsupport of revolution has already illustrated this connection between\nrevolution and just war because he conceives of revolution as an act\nof collective self-defense against usurpers of legitimate\npolitical power.\n\nIn this section, then, we will examine how the satisfaction of typical\njus ad bellum standards faces complications in the case of\nrevolutionary war. Before turning to this analysis, we must introduce\na key distinction concerning the social context of revolutions. The\nsocial context that a revolution takes place in can lead to variation\nwith respect to how violent a given revolution is, a crucial parameter\nfor assessing whether the conditions of jus ad bellum\nobtain.\n\nHow bloody and protracted a revolution is and whether it will be\nsuccessful will in part be a function of how well-organized and\neffective revolutionary leadership is. Accordingly, we will\ndistinguish between what we call Hobbesian revolutionary\ncontexts and Lockean revolutionary contexts. In Lockean\ncontexts, revolutionaries have access to institutional structures,\neither formal or informal, that they can rely on to solve two basic\nproblems: the cooperation problem (mobilizing a sufficient number of\nrevolutionaries) and the coordination problem (organizing the\nrevolutionaries in an effective manner). In Hobbesian contexts, by\ncontrast, such institutional resources are absent.\n\nHobbesian and Lockean contexts thus described are ideal types, with\nmost actual revolutions occurring in contexts that fall somewhere in\nbetween the ideal types. The American Revolution took place in a\nLockean context, insofar as revolutionaries had access to colonial\nlegislatures, through participation in which they had developed skills\nin organization and leadership. These institutional resources enabled\nAmerican revolutionaries to solve the cooperation and coordination\nproblems and to do so through relatively peaceful, democratic means.\nThe early stages of the Russian Revolution, in contrast, took place\nunder Hobbesian conditions, resulting in division and conflict among\nrevolutionary factions and uncoordinated violence by relatively small\ngroups (e.g. mutinying soldiers or striking laborers) acting\nindependently. In the Russian case, as opposed to the American one,\nthe process by which the cooperation and coordination problems were\nsolved did not provide the group that eventually took control of the\nrevolution, the Bolsheviks, with experience in non-coercive,\nrelatively democratic leadership.\n\nCrucially, the social context of a revolution is not fixed because, as\nSkopcol emphasizes, revolutions, to the extent that they are\nsuccessful, involve the creation of new state structures (Skocpol\n2015). Further, the context in which a revolution occurs can also\nchange prior to the successful seizure of sufficient power to build a\nnew state structure. One example of the latter kind is found in the\nIranian Revolution. This revolution began with widespread but\nuncoordinated student protests which, following some student deaths,\nwere transformed by Ayatollah Khomeini into an organized mass protest\nmovement. The institutional resource Khomeini utilized was a network\nof pre-existing religious institutions.\n\nIt will be important to keep in mind the distinction between Hobbesian\nand Lockean revolutionary contexts in order to avoid over generalizing\nabout the risks of revolution. If one assumes, if only implicitly,\nthat revolutions occur in predominantly Lockean conditions, one will\nbe predisposed to rate the risk of anarchy and extreme violence low\nand consequently take a more permissive stance on the justification of\nrevolution. If one assumes that Hobbesian conditions are predominant,\none will infer that the risks of revolution are great and be\npredisposed to regard revolutions as unjustified. Keeping in mind the\nneed to avoid over-generalization, we now turn to a consideration of\nhow standard jus ad bellum criteria apply to revolutions or\nat least to revolutions that are, like most revolutions, likely to\ninvolve large-scale collective violence.\n\nConsider first the just cause requirement. Some causes for revolution\nwe can set aside immediately, namely, those that are patently unjust.\nIt is not a legitimate aim of revolution, for example, to displace a\nliberal state that is reasonably effective at protecting basic human\nrights in order to institute a theocracy that will violate basic human\nrights. Nor would a revolution to institute or preserve slavery be\njustified. More appropriate targets of revolution are Resolute Severe\nTyrannies, defined as regimes that persistently violate some of the\nbasic human rights of large segments of the population, are extremely\nauthoritarian (that is, wholly undemocratic), and are utterly\nimpervious to efforts to reform them (Buchanan 2013, p. 296).\n\nThe moral stakes of opposing a Resolute Severe Tyranny will depend on\nwhich human rights are being violated. When relatively basic rights\nsuch as rights to one\u2019s life, body, or the conditions necessary\nfor subsistence are being violated, then officials and agents of the\nregime are plausibly liable to immediate defensive harm in the\nindividual cases where such violations arise and ending such\nsystematic violation of basic rights is a just cause for armed\nresistance of the regime (Finlay 2015, pp. 78). Tyrannies can be less\nsevere when the human rights they violate are relatively less urgent\nthan these basic rights, which would include political rights or\nrights against discrimination.\n\nWhile there might be cause for replacing a tyrannical regime, the\njustification of revolution encounters a complication when it comes to\ndetermining what kind of government or institutional arrangement ought\nto replace the regime if the revolution proves successful. This\nproblem is especially acute under Hobbesian conditions because\nrevolutionaries have repudiated or cannot avail themselves of existing\npolitical processes for determining political aims and have not yet\ndeveloped new processes for performing that task (at least in the\nearlier stages of the struggle). There may be serious disagreement\namong revolutionaries as to what the goal of the revolution is, with\nno nonviolent, much less legitimate process for resolving it. If\nrevolutionaries lack the institutional resources to determine a common\nunderstanding of what the new political order is to be, then the task\nof evaluating the justness of a revolutionary struggle becomes more\ndifficult. It may be a mistake to say \u201cX is the aim of\nthe revolutionary war-makers\u201d because there may be no one aim\nand the plurality of aims may be mutually inconsistent, with some\nbeing just and others being unjust. In certain contexts, then, the\ncause of a political revolution, its justifying aim, may be\nindeterminate.\n\nThough the cause of revolution may be indeterminate or unjust, it does\nnot follow that joining the fight, once it has started, is necessarily\nwrong or unjust (Buchanan 2013). Whether various individuals are\nmorally justified in joining the war effort depends upon whether they\nhave morally acceptable reasons for doing so, not upon the morality or\nimmorality of the actions others took to initiate the conflict. The\njustification for initiating revolution will be different from the\njustification for joining a revolution. This point is not limited to\nrevolutionary wars, but it may be more significant in the\nrevolutionary case, if generally speaking the initiation of\nrevolutionary wars is harder to justify than some interstate wars,\nespecially wars of self-defense or defense of others against\naggression.\n\nConsider now to the proportionality criterion, applied to\nrevolutionary war. Proportionality is satisfied when the moral\nsignificance of the goods achieved through revolution is greater than\nthe significance of the \u201cbads\u201d or harms or\nrights-violations that will be brought about by revolutionary\nconflict. As Richard Norman and David Rodin argue, the moral urgency\nof political rights seems to be categorically inferior to the\nsignificance of rights to life and limb that will be violated and\nthreatened by revolutionary war, thus making revolutionary war against\ntyrannies that only violate political rights unjustified (Norman 1995:\n128; Rodin 2002: 48). In a similar vein, Jonathan Parry argues that\nrevolutionaries are at a moral disadvantage when it comes to the\nsatisfaction of proportionality. That is because, on Parry\u2019s\nview, in order for some interests to count in the proportionality\ncalculus, the persons to whom those interests are tied must consent to\nthe use of force to protect those interests. And, since\nrevolutionaries are generally less likely to receive consent, this\nmeans that there will be fewer interests that count in favor of\nrevolutionary violence (Parry 2018).\n\nThere are a number of replies that one might offer in response to\nthese challenges concerning proportionality. First, one can argue that\nthe moral significance of the violation of relatively less urgent\nrights aggregates to a cost that is great enough to be proportionate\nto a relatively lesser number of harms to more urgent rights that will\nbe suffered as a consequence of violent revolution (McMahan 2004).\nThis aggregationist argument can also be bolstered by identifying\nfurther goods advanced by revolution. The effects of revolutionary war\nagainst \u201clesser tyranny\u201d on valid norm compliance\nmight also be included. Supposing that it is a valid norm that\ngovernments abstain from harming their citizens and respect the\npolitical liberties of citizens. If international institutions are so\nweak as to be unable to enforce this norm, then the best prospect for\nenforcing a norm of good government is the threat of revolution\nagainst governments that violate the norm. Under these conditions, it\nwould be problematic to restrict proportionality assessments to\nimmediate, direct harms, ignoring the effects on the enforcement of\nimportant norms of justice. Second, one could argue that a regime that\nviolates relatively less urgent rights does so by virtue of issuing a\nconditional threat, explicit or implicit, and that therefore the\nregime is responsible for escalation in conflict that occurs because\nof an assertion of the relatively less urgent rights by individuals,\nand use of force in response to such escalation is justified (McMahan\n1994; Finlay 2015: 63\u201376). Third, one could argue that\nproportionality is sensitive to responsibility, such that when one is\nresponsible for some harm or rights violation then the threshold of\nproportionality is lessened to some extent. So, if a regime is\nresponsible for violations of relatively less urgent human rights,\nthen this fact may make members of the regime liable to a degree of\nforce that would not have otherwise been proportionate (Kapelner\n2019). Fourth, one could argue that revolutions respond to a\ndistinctive kind of wrong that changes the proportionality calculus in\nfavor of revolution. Mattias Iser argues that states that bring about\nwidespread human rights violations thereby fail to recognize the equal\nbasic moral status of citizens, and that this failure of recognition\nis a distinctive kind of wrong that weighs in favor of forceful\nreplacement of prevailing regime (Iser 2017).\n\nThe preceding points concern proportionality in revolutionary war in\ngeneral. Under relatively Hobbesian conditions, there is a further\ncomplication concerning proportionality. In such conditions, aspiring\nrevolutionary leaders face a serious collective action problem that\nestablished states have already solved: they must mobilize a\nsufficient portion of the population to make war effectively, in spite\nof the fact that it will often be rational for any given individual to\nrefrain from participating. As we shall discuss in the context of\njus in bello criteria of just war, revolutionaries will often\nneed to resort to coercing other members of the population in order to\nmotivate cooperation in revolutionary activity. The regime is likely\nto respond in kind to such coercive tactics, producing an escalating\nspiral of violence.\n\nThe discussion so far helps explain a general feature of revolutions,\nnamely, that they are often more violent than interstate wars,\nespecially when undertaken in Hobbesian conditions. Revolutionary wars\npresent a greater risk of literal anarchy, with all of the threats to\nhuman rights and well-being that this usually entails, because\nrevolutionaries, even when they succeed in defeating the regime, may\nnot yet have (and in some cases may never develop) the capacity to\nimpose order. In that sense, the stakes are often higher in\nrevolutionary wars and the traditional likelihood of success\nrequirement of just war theory may be harder to satisfy. Revolutionary\nconflicts, like other intrastate wars, are often especially brutal,\nbecause the lines between combatants and noncombatants tend to be\nblurred, because of the spiral of coercion stemming from strategic\ninteraction regarding revolutionary mobilization mentioned above, and\nbecause individuals and groups often use the general context of\nviolence to settle private conflicts that have little or no connection\nto the issues for which revolution is supposedly undertaken (Kalyvas\n2006: 14).\n\nSimilar complications to those encountered in the case of just cause\nalso arise regarding satisfaction of the rightful authority\nrequirement, especially under Hobbesian revolutionary contexts. It is\ntypically held that in order for some agent to have the rightful\nauthority to wage just war, she must in some significant way represent\nthe persons whose interests the war is meant to protect or promote\n(Finlay 2015 ch. 6; Parry 2018). If \u201crepresents\u201d means\nwhat it does in the context of ordinary democratic politics, namely, A\nrepresents B if and only if A is authorized to act on B\u2019s behalf\nthrough some appropriate public political process (such as an\nelection), then this is a non-starter, since an oppressive regime is\nunlikely to allow any such process.\n\nThis standard, institutionally-based understanding of representation\nwould work as a criterion of rightful authority to initiate\nrevolutionary war only if one of two conditions were satisfied. First,\nthose who initiate revolutionary war were duly chosen as\nrepresentatives prior to the advent of an oppressive regime (as when\nan authoritarian coup usurps an elected government). Second, the\nconstitutional order included pre-authorization for revolution under\ncertain specified conditions. It is worth noting that the French\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen explicitly included a\nright (and indeed a duty) to resist tyranny and that the Inner Service\nAct of the Turkish Armed Forces (articles 35 and 85) goes farther,\ndesignating an agent of revolution by pre-authorizing the military to\ndepose the government if it violates the constitutional requirement of\nsecular government. Just as an advance directive for medical care\nenables a competent patient to pre-authorize agent to act on her\nbehalf in the event of her losing the capacity to act, so a\nconstitutional provision of this sort would enable a people under\nconditions of political freedom to pre-authorize some agent to\ninitiate revolution on its behalf should the abuse of government\nauthority undermine its ability to perform an act of authorization.\nWhereas under Lockean conditions there may be some residual\ninstitutional structures that can be relied on to choose genuinely\nrepresentative revolutionary leaders, when facing a Resolute Severe\nTyranny or occupying Hobbesian contexts it is far less likely that\neither conditions of representation can obtain. A Resolute Severe\nTyranny is not likely to allow any institutional process for\nrepresentation by those who may oppose it.\n\nHere it is important to note that revolutionary conflict in such\nconditions typically begins when a relatively small minority\nundertakes armed struggle against the government and claims to do so\nin the name of the people. The problem is that it is difficult to see\nhow, in Hobbesian contexts, they could be authorized to act on behalf\nof the people.\n\nAnother problem concerning rightful authority in Hobbesian contexts is\nthat there are often two or more parties engaging in revolutionary\nviolence that contend with one another (often violently) to be\nacknowledged, by the people and by other states and international\norganizations, as the sole legitimate revolutionary war-maker.\nRevolutions frequently are characterized by violent struggles for\nleadership, under conditions in which no contender for leadership can\nclaim exclusive legitimacy if any legitimacy at all. So, in addition\nto the fact that Hobbesian conditions are characterized by a lack of\nsocial or institutional resources for the determination of rightful\nauthority, there is the fact that rival revolutionary groups may\nresort to violence among themselves in a bid to claim such\nauthority.\n\nIn the absence of any institutional provisions for choosing\nrepresentatives during the struggle or for pre-authorizing some group\nto serve as representatives prior to it, one might offer a different\nunderstanding of representation that is easier to satisfy in contexts\nwhere political revolutions have some appeal. An agent represents the\npeople, in a fashion that morally empowers her to initiate and lead\nrevolutionary war, if she is committed to and acts appropriately to\nrealize their shared interest or common good (Biggar 2013). It is\nworth noting just how distant this view is from any widely accepted\nnotion of rightful authority to make war in other contexts or for that\nmatter of rightful authority in any context, whether private or\npublic. The fact that Jones is committed to Smith\u2019s good and\nable to promote it effectively does nothing whatsoever to establish\nthat Jones has rightful authority over Jones, much less that he has\nrightful authority to undertake actions supposedly on Jones\u2019s\nbehalf that pose a danger to Jones or others. This understanding of\nrightful authority is subject to all of the objections to paternalism\ntoward competent adults.\n\nAt this point one might make a radical move: simply deny the rightful\nauthority requirement applies to revolutionary wars or at least to\nrevolutionary wars that occur in a Hobbesian context. This move could\nbe qualified with the proviso that although a group attempting to\nexercise leadership in the revolutionary struggle lacks rightful\nauthority, it is justified in assuming the leadership role only if it\nacts in such a way as to bring about conditions in which rightful\nauthority can exist. Similarly, one might argue that rightful\nauthority is not required in the case of a group that can help create\nthe conditions for legitimacy out of a situation of violently anarchic\nstate-breakdown, so long as that group acts in ways that facilitate\nthe establishment of legitimacy. This response to the problem of\nrightful authority calls into question the assumption that a just\nrecourse to war developed for application to interstate wars also\napplies in toto to revolutionary wars. Similarly, as we shall\nsee in the next section, there is also the question of whether\ntraditional jus in bello requirements apply without exception\nto the conduct of revolutionary wars.\n\nLet us turn to the last criterion of jus ad bellum,\nnecessity. The standard of necessity is satisfied when there is no\nless harmful means of achieving the cause for violence. For a\nrevolution to be necessary, it must be the case that existing\ninstitutions are both so deeply morally flawed and recalcitrant to\nreform that nothing short of displacing them and starting anew would\nsuffice to improve upon the existing state of affairs. This is why\ndiscussions about revolution generally take for granted that the\ntarget of revolution is something like a Resolute Severe\nTyranny\u2014only such regimes pose such a significant enough threat\nto the basic rights of persons while barring all prospects for\nreforming political institutions. Plausible candidates for revolution,\nthen, are states that are so organized as to foreclose internal\nchannels for reform. These channels need not be exclusively legal or\nconstitutional. Even states that bar significant portions of the\npopulation from access to legal or political mechanisms for change\nmight not make revolution necessary. Citizens of such states may still\nhave access to options like protest, general strikes, civil\ndisobedience, and uncivil disobedience as a means of forcing the\nrelevant kind of changes, thus making revolution unnecessary. Hence,\nour discussion has followed most discussions of political revolution\nby focusing on the case of extremely repressive regimes like Resolute\nSevere Tyranny, because only under such conditions of complete and\nunrelenting oppression is it plausible that revolution is necessary to\nbring about change.\n",
