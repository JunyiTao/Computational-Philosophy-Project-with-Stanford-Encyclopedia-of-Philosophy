    "main_text": "History\n2. History\n\nThe history of philosophical theorising about properties and\nproperty-like entities (concepts, predicates, terms, forms,\nuniversals, qualities\u2026) contains many contrasts that seem\nbroadly similar to the contrast between more and less natural\nproperties, or between perfectly natural properties and the rest. A\nfew examples:\n\nIn a much-cited passage in the Phaedrus (265e), Plato\nsays giving a good definition involves \u201cdividing things\u2026\nwhere the natural joints are, and not trying to break any part, after\nthe manner of a bad carver\u201d.\n\n\nElsewhere (Parmenides 130a\u2013e), Plato suggests that\nsome but not all predicates correspond to Forms: there are Forms of\njustice, beauty, and goodness but no Forms of hair, mud, or dirt. (See\nthe entry on\n Plato\u2019s Parmenides)\nAristotle (De Interpretatione 11: 20b15\u201322)\ndistinguishes between terms with \u201cunity\u201d, like\n\u2018white\u2019, \u2018walking\u2019, \u2018man\u2019,\n\u2018animal\u2019, and \u2018rational animal\u2019, and other\nterms that lack unity, like \u2018walking white man\u2019. He also\nmakes a further distinction between genuine terms (which include both\nthose with and without unity) and \u2018indefinite names\u2019 like\n\u2018non-walking\u2019 and \u2018non-man\u2019.\nIn classical and medieval Indian philosophy, the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika tradition distinguishes \u201cgenuine\nuniversals\u201d (j\u0101ti) from \u201cimposed\u201d or\n\u201cnominal\u201d properties (up\u0101dhi). The\ntenth-century logician Udayana lists six \u201cimpediments\u201d\nwhich can be used to show that a word does not stand for a\nj\u0101ti: for example, no two j\u0101ti are\ncoextensive, and if two j\u0101ti share an instance, then one\nis such that every instance of it is also an instance of the other.\n(For more details and citations, see the entry on\n analytic philosophy in Early Modern India.)\nThere is a long tradition (stretching back to Plato and Aristotle)\naccording to which some properties (terms, concepts, forms,\u2026)\nare simple (primitive, indefinable, unanalysable), and while\nthe remainder are complex\u2014some more complex than\nothers\u2014and in some sense \u201cdefinable\u201d from the simple\nones. One author who is particularly interested in this contrast, and\nwho conceives of it in a way that makes it clearly one of metaphysics\nas opposed to mere human psychology, is Leibniz. He argues that there\nmust be absolutely simple terms for it to be possible to conceive of\nanything at all (Mates\n 1986,\n 58). He has no settled view as regards what these absolutely simple\nterms are, although he does at one point (Leibniz\n 1680\u201385)\n suggest a list of \u201csimpler\u201d terms in terms of which all\nothers can be defined.\nThe founding figures of analytic philosophy continue this\ntradition. Moore\n (1903,\n \u00a71.7) argues that \u2018good\u2019 denotes something\n\u201csimple and unanalysable\u201d, whereas \u2018horse\u2019\ndenotes something complex. (See the entry on\n G. E. Moore.)\n Bertrand Russell\n (1918,\n 111) claims that the \u201cultimate simples, out of which the world\nis built\u201d include simple particulars, simple qualities, and\nsimple relations. (See the entry on\n Russell\u2019s logical atomism.)\n Later, Ramsey\n (1925)\n argues for eliminating all complex properties, so that most\npredicates will not correspond to properties at all. \nIn David Armstrong\u2019s theory of universals (Armstrong\n 1978),\n which Lewis credits as the main inspiration for his work on\nnaturalness, many predicates do not correspond to universals at all;\nmoreover, some universals are more complex than others, and some may\nindeed be perfectly simple.\n\n\nThe tradition of theorising about \u201csimple\u201d and\n\u201ccomplex\u201d properties is a particularly important\nantecedent for the contemporary use of \u2018natural\u2019, for two\nreasons. First, one can ask both whether a property is more or less\nsimple than some other property, and whether it is perfectly simple.\nSecond, whereas it is supposed to be relatively easy to tell in many\ncases that a property is complex, identifying perfectly simple\nproperties is generally not supposed to be easy: such claims need to\nbe argued for as part of some ambitious metaphysical theory. The\ncentral difference between this traditional use of\n\u2018simple\u2019 and the contemporary use of \u2018natural\u2019\nis that the former use is bound up with a battery of assumed analogies\nbetween properties and other kinds of entities\u2014concrete objects,\nor linguistic expressions\u2014which the latter use does not require.\nThe claim that a property is complex is understood to entail that in\nsome sense it has other properties as \u201cparts\u201d, from which\nit is \u201cput together\u201d; the perfectly simple properties are\nexactly those that lack parts\u2014the analogues of letters or words\nin the realm of linguistic expressions. The paradigm for\n\u201cparthood\u201d is the relation between the conjunction of two\nproperties and each of those two properties: for example, being\nred and being square would be taken to be parts of\nbeing red and square. Indeed, for most of the history of this\ntradition this seems to be the only clearly recognised form of\ncomplexity; insofar as properties like not being red and\nsquare are recognised at all, they seem to be excluded from the\ndomain to which distinctions of simplicity are to be applied. Only\nrelatively late, in the works of authors like Moore and Russell, do we\nfind a picture where conjunction is merely one of several different\noperations for building complex properties, others including\ndisjunction, existential quantification, etc. The contemporary use of\n\u2018natural\u2019 is plausibly seen as a cleaned-up version of\nthis older tradition, purged of the additional assumptions that might\nbe read into the mereological terminology. It is compatible with the\nthesis of \u201cintensionalism\u201d, according to which necessarily\ncoextensive properties are identical; Lewis was in fact an influential\ndefender of this thesis. Given intensionalism, the fact that a\nproperty can be derived from other properties by logical operations\nlike conjunction cannot rule out its being perfectly natural, since\neven a perfectly natural property \\(F\\) will be identical to the\nconjunction of \\(F\\)-or-\\(G\\) with \\(F\\)-or-not-\\(G\\), for any other\nproperty \\(G\\). However the contemporary use is also compatible with\nfiner-grained views about the identity of properties, and it would be\nnatural for proponents of such views to hold that no perfectly natural\nproperty is a conjunction, disjunction, existential quantification,\netc. Such generalizations will be considered further in\n \u00a74.10\n below.\n",
