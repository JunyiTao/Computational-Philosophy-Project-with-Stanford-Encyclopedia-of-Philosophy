The Transparency and Openness\nPromotion (TOP) guidelines (Nosek et al. 2015) have, as at the end of\nMay, 2018, almost 5,000 journals and organizations as signatories.\nDeveloped within psychology, TOP guidelines have formed the basis of\nother disciplinary specific guidelines, such as the Tools for\nTransparency in Ecology and Evolution (TTEE). As the name suggests,\nthese guidelines promote more complete and transparent reporting of\nmethodological and statistical practices. This in turn enables\nauthors, reviewers and editors to consider detailed aspects of their\nsample size planning and design decisions, and to clearly distinguish\nbetween confirmatory (planned) analysis and exploratory (post hoc)\nanalysis.\nPre-registration. In its simplest form, pre-registration\ninvolves making a public, date-stamped statement of predictions and/or\nhypotheses, either before data is collected, viewed or analysed. The\npurpose is to distinguish prediction from postdiction (Nosek et al.\n2018), or what is elsewhere referred to as confirmatory research from\nexploratory research (Wagenmakers et al. 2012) and a distinction\nperhaps more commonly known as hypothesis testing versus hypothesis\ngenerating research. Pre-registration of predictive research helps\ncontrol for HARKing (Kerr 1998) and hindsight bias, and within the\nfrequentist Null Hypothesis Significance Testing, helps contain the\nfalse positive error rate to the set alpha level. There are several\nplatforms that host pre-registrations, such as the Open Science\nFramework (osf.io) and As Predicted (aspredicted.org). The Open\nScience Framework also hosts a \u201cpre-registration\nchallenge\u201d offering monetary rewards for publishing\npre-registered work.\nSpecific Journal Initiatives. Some high impact journals,\nhaving been singled out in the science media as having particularly\nproblematic publishing practices (e.g., Schekman 2013), have taken\nexceptional steps to improve the completeness, transparency and\nreproducibility of the research they publish. For example, since 2013,\nNature and Nature research journals have engaged in a range\nof editorial activities aimed at improving reproducibility of research\npublished in their journals \n (see the editorial announcement, \nNature 496, 398, 25 April 2013,  doi:10.1038/496398a).  In\n2017, they introduced checklists and reporting summaries (published\nalongside articles) in an effort to improve transparency and\nreproducibility. In 2018, they produced discipline specific versions\nfor Nature Human Behaviour and Nature Ecology &\nEvolution. Within psychology, the journal Psychological\nScience (flagship journal of the Association of Psychological\nScience) was the first to adopt open science practices, such the COS\nOpen Science badges described below. Following a meeting of ecology\nand evolution journal editors in 2015, a number of journals in these\nfields have run editorials on this topic, often committing to TTEE\nguidelines (discussed above). Conservation Biology has in\naddition adopted a checklist for associate editors (Parker et\nal. 2016).\n\n",
