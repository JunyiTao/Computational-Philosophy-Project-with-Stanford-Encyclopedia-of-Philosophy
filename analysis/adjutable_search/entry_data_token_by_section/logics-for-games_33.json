    "main_text": "Interfacing Logic and Probability in Games || Probabilities and Beliefs\n5.1 Probabilities and Beliefs\n\nProbabilistic methods are widely employed to represent beliefs of\nagents within and outside of games, witness\n Bayesian epistemology.\n Typically, a probabilistic belief model consists of two components: a\nspace of possible states that the agent\u2019s beliefs range over,\nplus a quantitative probability function denoting how probable the\nagent judges different propositions or states to be. In qualitative\nlogical models, on the other hand, agentive belief is represented in\nvarying degree of detail. The coarsest approach only distinguishes\nstates the agent considers possible from those she rules out. This is\nthe perspective of standard epistemic-doxastic logics, such as\nmulti-agent S5 and KD45 discussed in\n Section 3.6.\n More fine-grained perspectives are employed in the plausibility\nmodels of Boutilier (1994) and Baltag\nand Smets (2008), where the range of\nepistemic options is structured further by plausibility orderings\nencoding which options agents take to be less or more likely. See also\nSections\n 3.6.4\n and\n 4.2.\n\nBoth probabilistic and plausibilistic perspectives can express that\nsome alternative is more likely than another. However, there are also\nconceptual differences between the two frameworks. Probabilistic\nmodels can aggregate, allowing their logic to express, for instance,\nwhether many low-probability events combined can outweigh even the\nhighest-probability worlds. Aggregated probabilities play a key role,\nfor instance, in calculations of expected utility. Yet no such thing\ncan be expressed in plausibility semantics. For another striking\ndifference, plausibility models lead to a notion of belief that is\nclosed under conjunction. This conjunction closure typically fails for\nprobabilistic accounts of belief. See however Leitgeb\n(2017) for a sophisticated bridge\nbetween both types of modeling. \n",
