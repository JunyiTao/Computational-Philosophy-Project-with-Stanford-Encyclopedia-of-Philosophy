    "main_text": "Varieties of Civic Humanism || Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli\n4. The Pre-history of Civic Humanism\n\nAs previously noted, Baron posited that the birth of civic humanism\noccurred precisely out of the 1402 crisis in Florence. This position\nhas been challenged on various historical grounds, most notably by\nSeigel (1966). One problem with Baron\u2019s claim stems from his\nevident lack of familiarity with the political philosophy of preceding\ncenturies. Long before the beginning of the quattrocento,\npolitical authors (some of Florentine origin) had undertaken the\ndefense of the republican system of government generally and of the\nRoman Republic in particular in terms redolent of civic humanism.\nWriting c. 1265, a Florentine civil servant exiled to France, Brunetto\nLatini (1993), argued for the superiority of republics (communes) over\nother types of constitution and also described in detail the\nmechanisms of republican governance. Around 1300, another Italian, the\nParis-educated scholastic philosopher Ptolemy of Lucca (1997),\ncomposed an extensive brief favoring the Roman Republic as the ideal\nform of government (Blythe 2009; but see also Yun 2008 and Nederman\nand Sullivan 2012). The size of the list of pro-republican political\ntheorists writing before 1402 could be multiplied many times over.\n\nWhy was Baron inattentive to pre-Renaissance European republicanism?\nThe answer may be traced to what civic humanism represented to him:\nmodernity, secularity, rationality; in sum, the \u201cglory\u201d of\nthe Renaissance in contrast with the benighted Middle Ages. Scholars\nhave long since realized that a dividing line drawn between medieval\nand early modern periods is wholly unwarranted (Nederman 2009). Just\nas civic humanism as the designation of an intellectual movement\nwithin the tradition of Western political theory proves to be quite\ncapacious, so its existence and development should be regarded as more\nfluid historically than has often been claimed.\n",
