    "main_text": "Motivations\n1. Motivations\nThere have been many attempts to define truth in terms of\n correspondence,\n coherence or other notions. \nHowever, it is far from clear that truth is a definable notion. In\nformal settings satisfying certain natural conditions, Tarski\u2019s\ntheorem on the undefinability of the truth predicate shows that a\ndefinition of a truth predicate requires resources that go beyond\nthose of the formal language for which truth is going to be defined.\nIn these cases definitional approaches to truth have to fail. By contrast,\nthe axiomatic approach does not presuppose that truth can be\ndefined. Instead, a formal language is expanded by a new primitive\npredicate for truth or satisfaction, and axioms for that predicate are then laid\ndown. This approach by itself does not preclude the possibility that the truth predicate\nis definable, although in many cases it can be shown that the truth\npredicate is not definable.\nIn semantic theories of truth (e.g., Tarski 1935, Kripke 1975), in\ncontrast, a truth predicate is defined for a language, the so-called\nobject language. This definition is carried out in a metalanguage or\nmetatheory, which is typically taken to include set theory or at least\nanother strong theory or expressively rich interpreted\nlanguage. Tarski\u2019s theorem on the undefinability of the truth\npredicate shows that, given certain general assumptions, the resources\nof the metalanguage or metatheory must go beyond the resources of the\nobject-language. So semantic approaches usually necessitate the use of\na metalanguage that is more powerful than the object-language for\nwhich it provides a semantics.\nAs with other formal deductive systems, axiomatic theories of truth can be\npresented within very weak logical frameworks. These frameworks require very\nfew resources, and in particular, avoid the need for a strong metalanguage and\nmetatheory. \nFormal work on axiomatic theories of truth has helped to shed some light on\nsemantic theories of truth. For instance, it has yielded information on what is\nrequired of a metalanguage that is sufficient for defining a truth predicate.\nSemantic theories of truth, in turn, provide one with the theoretical tools\nneeded for investigating models of axiomatic theories of truth and with\nmotivations for certain axiomatic theories. Thus axiomatic and semantic\napproaches to truth are intertwined.\nThis entry outlines the most popular axiomatic theories of truth and\nmentions some of the formal results that have been obtained concerning them. We\ngive only hints as to their philosophical applications.\n",
