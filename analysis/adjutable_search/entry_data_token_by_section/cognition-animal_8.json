    "main_text": "Animal Cognition Applied to Philosophy || The problem of other minds\n3.1 The problem of other minds\n\nThe traditional philosophical problem of other minds, which challenges\nus to consider the evidential basis for our commitment that other\nhumans are minded beings like ourselves, exists in an extreme form\nwhen applied to other animals (see Andrews 2020b: Chapter 1).\n\nThe traditional argument from analogy for other minds rests on\nsimilarities between oneself and other humans. While the traditional\nargument is weak enough, when the analogy goes from humans to members\nof another species, it becomes significantly weaker.\n\nThe argument from analogy for animal minds can be formulated\nas:\n\nHumans who have minds have some property M.\nIndividuals of species A have property M.\nTherefore, individuals of species A probably have\nminds.\n\n\nBut what is M? Commonly used properties in such arguments\ninclude observable behaviors (such as emotional or communicative\nbehavior), passing certain experimental tests (such as success on a\nmemory task or a reasoning task), or physical structures (such as the\nexistence of a neocortex).\n\nThe inference to the best explanation argument for animal\nminds rests on the claim that the existence of animal minds is a\nbetter explanation of animal behavior and physiology than those\noffered by other hypotheses. This argument can be formulated as:\n\nIndividuals of species x engage in behaviors y.\nThe best scientific explanation for an individual engaging in\nbehaviors y is that they have a mind.\nTherefore, it is likely that individuals of species x have\nminds.\n\n\nWhen we look for the best explanation for a phenomenon, we first have\nto generate a number of hypotheses, and then decide between them. The\nbest explanation will be the one that can be used to generate accurate\npredictions and that coheres with our other scientific\ncommitments.\n\nThe argument from evolutionary parsimony is based on the idea\nthat closely related species share some physical traits, and this\nrelationship can offer evidence in favor of a mentalistic causal\nexplanation in certain cases. For example, we can consider this\nargument that chimpanzees have minds:\n\nThe more parsimonious explanation requires the fewest changes\nbetween species with recent common ancestors.\nHumans and chimpanzees have a recent common ancestor.\nHumans achieve behavior B by psychological capacity\nP.\nTherefore, it is most parsimonious to infer that chimpanzees\nachieve behavior B by psychological capacity P.\n\n\nIn his discussion of this style of argument, Elliott Sober (2015)\npoints out that phylogenetic parsimony only offers some evidence of\nthe trait in other animals; while the probability of chimpanzees\nhaving P is raised by the presence of P in humans, given\nother considerations we might still conclude that the probability of\nchimpanzees having P is low.\n\nThese arguments all have their weakness when it comes to their ability\nto justify belief in other animal minds, just as the humancentric\nversions do when it comes to other human minds. Even when used in\nconjunction with one another, there is room for doubt when it comes to\nother minds. However, in the case of humans, it is deemed a mental\nillness to worry that the others around you are actually minded. The\nweakness of these arguments suggests that when we are doing science\nand trying to determine the causes of behavior, we are engaged in one\nproject, but when we are considering the traditional problem of other\nminds when it comes to other animals, we are engaged in a different\nkind of project, one of relating to others.\n\nDale Jamieson (1998) argues that the problem of other minds is solved\nnot inferentially, but via engagement with other beings. The\ninferential solution to the problem suggests that when we see other\nbeings we see behaving bodies rather than agents or\npeople\u2014individuals we can have relationships with. Jamieson\nsuggests that this idea of a behaving body is a \u201cphilosophical\nmonster\u201d\u2014a boogie man created by philosophers that creates\na problem rather than solving one.\n\nWhen philosophers presume humans have minds, rather than feel that\nthey have to prove their existence, they can move forward to ask\nquestions about those minds. The same goes for other species.\nSkepticism about the existence of other minds remains a possibility in\nthe human as well as the nonhuman case.\n",
