Genesis and Development of a Thought Style and of Facts\n\nThe democratically equal regard for everybody makes scientists write\npopular works to familiarize laypersons\u2014as far as it is\npossible\u2014with a current state of knowledge. They use widely\nunderstood common language full of imprecise expressions and\nmetaphors. Since popular texts cannot include complications which a\nprofessional meets every day in her work and because an author speaks\nto the public as an authority, such books and articles have a dogmatic\ncharacter. Instead of provisions like \u201cit seems that\u201d,\n\u201cas we tried to prove\u201d often present in scientific papers,\nin popular works there are expressions like \u201cit is a fact\nthat\u201d or \u201cas science has proven\u201d. This has serious\n(although not intended) effects on the development of science itself,\nfor those who are to become scientists in future have their first\ncontact with a discipline precisely through popular readings. Thus,\nwhat was created by a group of people acquires an impersonal,\nautonomous character. \u201cSocial distance transforms the author\nfrom a creator to a discoverer\u201d\u2014and this is how a mythical\nideal of knowledge \u201cas representation of reality independent of\nthe subject of cognition\u201d (1936, VI) arises.\n\nOne should then start to read textbooks and experiment under the\nsupervision of specialists. This introduction into a domain still has\na dogmatic character. An individual\u2019s mind is introduced\n\u201cinto a self-contained world\u201d and acquires a peculiar\nmystagogy. Finally, some people become fully-fledged members of a\nthought collective of a scientific discipline\u2014specialists:\n\u201cthe expert is already a specially molded individual who can no\nlonger escape the bonds of tradition and of the collective; otherwise\nhe would not be an expert\u201d (1935a, III).\n\nAs a specialist she starts to face certain research problems. She does\nnot face them alone: she is a member of a group, where everybody\nperceives the world similarly and thinks about it in (almost) the same\nway. And if an issue is new, then any success is achievable only if\nthe whole group of scholars is engaged. Usually the analyzed phenomena\nare extremely complicated and diversified\u2014and they require\ndistinguishing, segregation, unification, and simplification, and\nthose are tasks which exceed the capabilities of any single\nresearcher. \u201cOnly through organized cooperative research,\nsupported by popular knowledge and continuing over several\ngenerations, might a unified picture emerge\u201d (1935a, II.1).\n\nWe do not only mean here that there is too much work to do. When\nphenomena are not sufficiently examined, we lack concepts by means of\nwhich we could adequately describe them. And we also cannot begin with\ngathering facts. Traditionally\u2014and today some still think\nso\u2014facts were considered to be what is given and accessible\nthrough the senses. Modern empiricists claimed that there is nothing\nin the mind that was not first in the senses. Fleck reversed this\nmaxim: there is nothing in the senses that was not first in the mind.\nSo, in order to perceive we have to learn something before. It is not\nso that we first see some moving dashes and then we compose a whole of\nthem. Quite the contrary:\n\nWe walk around without seeing any points, lines, angles, light or\nshadows, from which we would have to arrange \u201cwhat is\nthis\u201d by synthesis or reasoning, but we see at once a house, a\nmemorial in a square, a detachment of soldiers, a bookshop window, a\ngroup of children, a lady with a dog, all of them ready forms.\n(\u2026) We look with our own eyes, but we see with the eyes of the\ncollective body, we see the forms whose sense and range of permissible\ntranspositions is created by the collective body (1947, II).\n\n\nThis set of forms was transferred to an individual in the process of\nsocialization. When we bring a layperson to a laboratory and we ask\nher to describe a course of scientific experiments, professionals will\nfind out immediately that she is not able to do this. She will surely\ncreate a long description and bring up a lot of unimportant or\naccidental details, but she will not pay attention to what is\nimportant from a scientist\u2019s point of view. \u201cIf we wanted\nnecessarily to render his experience in words, the most appropriate\nslogan would be: \u2018I search\u2019 or \u2018I have a\nchaos\u2019\u201d (1935b). An expert sees differently than a\nlayperson because she went through a special training during which she\nwas familiarized with many examples\u2014e.g. symptoms of a given\ndisease and at the same time symptoms of other diseases (so with what\nX is and what X is not). At the same time she was\nequipped with a certain set of views on what that disease is, on the\ncourse of it, on how it is affected by external conditions etc. Thus,\nif the training process is successful a new member of a collective\nwill directly see the same as what other members see \u201cwith their\nown eyes\u201d. As Fleck states in the last sentence of (1935b),\n\u201c\u2019To see\u2019 means: to recreate, at a suitable moment,\na picture created by the mental collective to which one\nbelongs\u201d.\n\nHowever, when a specialist starts research on phenomena of a new kind\nshe is in the same situation as a layperson: she does not know what\nand how to observe. She does not recognize certain forms, she\nexperiences chaos in which it is very hard to grasp anything constant.\nThis is why\u2014as it was mentioned above\u2014scholars cannot\nstart from gathering experimental data. Fleck also stresses that there\nis no spontaneous creation of concepts (1935a, II.1). This is why a\nnew research starts usually\u2014although not always\u2014from\nproto-ideas which often are of a religious or philosophical character,\nwhich had existed centuries before they acquired a scientific\ncharacter. For example, long before Copernicus there was a proto-idea\nof a heliocentric system, before Lavoisier\u2014a proto-idea of\nchemical elements, before Dalton\u2014a proto-idea of atom, and\nbefore Leeuwenhoek\u2014a proto-idea of microbe (1935a, II.2).\nProto-ideas are vague, and therefore in the scientific understanding\nthey cannot be considered as true or false. (Even though they were\ntrue for the members of corresponding thought collectives). But they\ncan become a point of departure for investigation.\n\nInquiries cannot be conducted by an isolated researcher, for she would\nchase her tail endlessly by repeating old formulas. As we have\nmentioned before, the constitution of a research collective is\nnecessary and it happens when an appropriate mood arises\u2014a mood\nwhich unites people and makes them work. In the case of research that\nwas analyzed by Fleck, i.e., the research which led to the discovery\nof Wassermann\u2019s reaction, the source of an appropriate mood was\nsocial pressure\u2014a common demand for effective means for curing\nsyphilis which was considered as an embarrassing and\nreputation-damaging disease. (Fleck brought forward a controversial\nclaim that the absence of any analogous success in the struggle with\ntuberculosis was related to a common approach to tuberculosis as\n\u201cromantic\u201d, which in turn resulted with insufficient\nsocial pressure to overcome it.) This made the German government join\nthe process of organizing research teams in that area; an additional\nreason was to make achievements of German scientists outmatch\nachievements of other nations. \u201cThe mood gave a driving power,\nand the proto-idea\u2014the direction\u201d (1934).\n\nIf a group of people participate in a research program there occurs a\npeculiar process. Each member of the group reads different texts (both\npopular and professional), participates in different experiments, and\nbelongs to more or less different thought collectives (both scientific\nand non-scientific). So, when they start speaking to each other and\nreading each other\u2019s papers, a series of misunderstandings\narises. Ideas circulate within a collective and are enriched by new\nassociations, and therefore the words that are used change their\nmeanings. Sometimes nothing is left of the original meanings intended\nby those participating in the exchange of ideas. Sometimes the changes\nstem from a clash of various proto-ideas. And that clash itself is a\nresult of various social factors. Having conducted countless studies\nand conversations and embarked upon a long journey, the scholars\nfinally create a thought style which nobody intended. And after this\nhas happened, nobody post factum knows when and how that\nstyle started to operate and who, specifically, created it.\n\nThoughts pass from one individual to another, each time a little\ntransformed, for each individual can attach to them somewhat different\nassociations. Strictly speaking, the receiver never understands the\nthought exactly in the way that the transmitter intended it to be\nunderstood. After a series of such encounters, practically nothing is\nleft of the original content. Whose thought is it that continues to\ncirculate? It is one that obviously belongs not to any single\nindividual but to the collective (1935a, II.4).\n\n\nOf course this process\u2014an important element of which are\nmisunderstandings among researchers\u2014cannot be logically\nreconstructed.\n\nTogether with the mutation of ideas, new forms recognized in\nsensations occur. First, when observing phenomena of a new kind one\nreaches for the set of known forms\u2014and starts to recognize that\nthis, what is new, sometimes and under a certain respect resembles\nwhat is known, but some other times and under other respects it is\ndifferent. In this period descriptions of results of experiments are\nfull of comparisons with what one earlier learned to perceive, but\nalso are full of provisions that those comparisons are sometimes\nunreliable. The unreliability manifests itself in the unrepeatability\nof initial experiments: something goes differently than before, and we\nknow neither why it was so, nor what to do in order to get the same\nresult next time. This raises concerns and the readiness for change. A\nresearcher acting more or less blindly, searches for some constraints\nof thought:\n\nThe work of the research scientist means that in the complex confusion\nand chaos which he faces, he must distinguish that which obeys his\nwill from that which arises spontaneously and opposes it. This is the\nfirm ground that he, as representative of the thought collective,\ncontinuously seeks (1935a, IV.2).\n\n\nChanges in the way of seeing cannot\u2014as it was said\nbefore\u2014be made by an individual. Descriptions of experiments\ncirculate among scientists, and again as a result of misunderstandings\nand understandings the traditional forms are (and this fact is not\nnoticed by the participants of that process) restyled, some are\nrejected, other connected into unique wholes, \u201cand, finally, a\nnew readiness is formed, i.e. the readiness to see a new, specific\nform\u201d (1935b). Finally, in descriptions published in\nprofessional papers comparisons disappear and one states: this and\nthat was observed. (Similarly, after some time of being in contact\nwith the Latin alphabet we directly recognize the letter A despite the\nenormous variety of shapes it exists in, and at the same time we are\nnot able to say what this recognizing consists in, cf. Fleck 1947,\nI.)\n\nThus, it is impossible to see something radically new \u201csimply\nand immediately\u201d: first the constrains of an old thought style\nmust be removed and a new style must emerge, a collective\u2019s\nthought mood must change\u2014and this takes time and work with\nothers. In the course of interpersonal exchange concepts evolve and\nfacts evolve together with them. This in turn stimulates creation of\nnew concepts.\n\nBoth thinking and facts are changeable, if only because changes in\nthinking manifest themselves in changed facts. Conversely,\nfundamentally new facts can be discovered only through new thinking\n(1935a, II.4).\n\n\nSometimes new ideas come from unexpected directions and without any\nrelation to science itself. This is how Fleck explains the discovery\nof spermatozoon which happened together with the fall of political\nabsolutism and popularization of the idea of individual freedom\nunderstood mainly as freedom of personal movement. One could not\ndiscover spermatozoon just looking through a microscope. However\nsomeone, who thought about a free person, could notice freely\nmoving\u2014so \u201cfree\u201d\u2014spermatozoa (1939a). This was\nthe influence of environment which created a restless mood necessary\nfor searching for something new. And a new mode of thinking created in\na different domain of life allowed one to perceive, distinguish, and\ndescribe it in a way which would stimulate reflections of\nothers\u2014those participating in revolutionary social changes as\nwell.\n\nBefore new sensual and thought forms arise, a certain \u201cspecific\nintellectual unrest must arise and a change of the moods of the\nthought collective\u201d (1935b). If a person makes an important\ndiscovery but social moods do not change, she will not find people who\ntake up her ideas and continue research. On the other hand facts are\nmutually dependent on each other, so \u201ceach new fact\nharmoniously\u2014though even so slightly\u2014changes all earlier\nfacts\u201d (1935a, IV.3). As a result, it sometimes happens that\nthose initial observations from which a certain research began does\nnot belong to the same class of facts as the one emerging from that\nresearch. (The research on the variability of bacteria was initiated\nby observations made in 1906 by Neisser and Massini, which today are\nregarded as bacteriophage effects.) Sometimes nothing remains of the\nproto-ideas from which investigations started and which inspired early\nexperimental work. (Like the proto-idea of syphilis blood has nothing\nto do with contemporary Wassermann\u2019s reaction). And finally\nthere arises the edifice of knowledge which was neither intended nor\nforeseen by anybody.\n\nIn this process there is nothing necessary; various accidental\ncircumstances decide which ideas become a basis for investigation and\nare disseminated within a collective; which meetings between\nscientists happen; which research projects acquire social support;\nwhich experiments are conducted first etc. Fleck claims that if e.g.\nSigle\u2019s idea of protozoa-like structures as the causative agent\nof syphilis had acquired sufficient support, we would have reached a\nharmonious system of knowledge different from the current one. The\nscope of the name \u201csyphilis\u201d would have been somewhat\ndifferent than it is today, just like the methods of research and\ntherapy would. But when a certain thought style develops and dominates\nresearchers\u2019 minds, alternative ways of development become\nclosed. Summing up this idea Fleck claims that most\u2014and maybe\neven the whole\u2014content of scientific knowledge is conditioned by\nhistorical, psychological and sociological factors and one has to\nconsider them when attempting to explain that content (1935a,\nII.1).\n\nOf course, a series of misunderstandings is not enough to create a\nthought style that connects everybody. This is why for the existence\nof a certain discipline the main body of an esoteric circle is\nnecessary\u2014the group composed of general specialists well\nprepared to choose among propositions of the vanguard those that are\nmost useful, and to elaborate, employ and harmonize them with each\nother. I.e. to create from a set of provisional claims present in\npapers aimed at professionals a system and to pass it on to a next\ngeneration of researchers. This occurs when textbooks are created.\n\n(\u2026) a judgment about the existence or non-existence of a\nphenomenon belongs, in a democratic collective, to a numerous council,\nnot to an individual. The textbook changes the subjective judgment of\nan author into a proven fact. It will be united with the entire system\nof science, it will henceforward be recognized and taught, it will\nbecome a foundation of further facts and the guiding principle of what\nwill be seen and applied (1936, VI).\n\n\nThe social structure of a scientific thought collective is reflected\nin types of scientific literature. Papers in scientific journals are\nwritten by scientists working practically on a given problem and are\naimed at other scientists. More general specialists write textbooks\nconsolidating their esoteric circle and educating its new members.\nPopular works are directed to exoteric circles.\n\nThe victory of a thought style depends on whether it will be possible\nto have a next generation of its followers, and to prevent influences\nof other styles. Certain research problems should be propagated, and\nother should be removed. A certain mental readiness must be created\namong the adepts of science. When it is achieved, all researchers\n\u201cwill see the new form directly, with their own eyes, as if it\nwere the only one, everlasting truth, independent of the people\u201d\n(1935b). At the end of his life Fleck summarized this as follows:\n\nEvery cognition is a social act (\u2026) for during every lasting\nexchange of thoughts there appear and grow ideas and standards which\nare not associated with any individual author. A communal mode of\nthinking develops which binds all participants, and certainly\ndetermines every act of cognition. Therefore, cognition must be\nconsidered as a function of three components: it is a relation between\nthe individual subject, the certain object and the given community of\nthinking (Denkkollektiv), within which the subject acts; it\nworks only when a certain style of thinking (Denkstil),\noriginating in the given community is used (1986).\n\n\nThe victory of a given thought style is never ultimate. Each new\nexperimental discovery and every theoretical idea more or less changes\nthe whole system. Even if at the beginning one sees only what\ncorresponds with the theory, after a while there appear complications\nand exceptions (Kuhn\u2019s anomalies) which sooner or later leads to\nrevisions of concepts and assumptions. \u201cMutations\u201d in a\nthought style, such as contemporary transformations in physics or in\nbacteriology, constantly occur. Sooner or later we will have to change\ne.g. the law of conservation of energy (1935a, II.1) and any other\nconcept and claim. In the historical development of science there is\nnothing determined once and for all, nothing invariant. Both thinking\nand facts change.\n",
