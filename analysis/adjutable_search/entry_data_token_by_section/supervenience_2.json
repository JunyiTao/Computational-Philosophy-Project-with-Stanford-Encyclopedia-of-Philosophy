    "main_text": "History || Origin of the Term\n2.2 Origin of the Term\n\nWhat, then, is the origin of the philosophical use of the\nterm? It is not clear. Some have speculated that it originates with\nthe British Emergentists of the early part of the twentieth century.\nThis is because the British Emergentist Lloyd Morgan (1923) used the\nterm \u2018supervene\u2019 to characterize a relation that emergent\nproperties bear to their base properties, and his use became fairly\nwidespread in the literature on emergence. However, Morgan used\n\u2018supervene\u2019 in essentially its vernacular sense, rather\nthan in its current philosophical sense. He held that emergent\nproperties are distinct from, and additional to, their base\nproperties, and arise unpredictably from them. It was this use, not\nthe current philosophical use, that became fairly widespread in the\nliterature on emergence (see Van Cleve 1990; and McLaughlin 1992 and\n1997b).\n\nIt is also frequently claimed that the term \u2018supervene\u2019\nwas first used in its contemporary philosophical sense by R.M. Hare,\nwho used it to characterize a relationship between moral properties\nand natural properties (1952, 145). Unlike Morgan, Hare used the term\nin essentially the current philosophical sense, but he claims that he\nwas not the first to do so. He claims that the term was so used in\nOxford in the 1940s, though he does not recall by whom, or in what\ncontext (Hare 1984).\n\nIt is important to be clear, however, that whether or not Hare was the\nfirst to use the term \u2018supervene\u2019 in the philosophical\nsense, he was by no means the first to assert a supervenience thesis.\nFor example, while G. E. Moore did not use the term\n\u2018supervene\u2019, he asserted: \u201cone of the most important\nfacts about qualitative difference\u2026[is that] two things cannot\ndiffer in quality without differing in intrinsic nature\u201d (1922,\n263). And there are many other historical examples of such explicit\nstatements of supervenience theses. Moreover, though we are not going\nto argue the point here, it seems no exaggeration to say that\nvirtually every major figure in the history of western philosophy has\nbeen at least implicitly committed to some supervenience thesis or\nother (or to the denial of one).\n\nBut regardless of how long the notion of supervenience has been\naround, or who first used the term \u2018supervenience\u2019 in its\nphilosophical sense, it is indisputable that Donald Davidson played a\nkey role in bringing the idea to center stage. He introduced the term\n\u2018supervenience\u2019 into contemporary philosophy of mind in\nthe following passage:\n\n[M]ental characteristics are in some sense dependent, or supervenient,\non physical characteristics. Such supervenience might be taken to mean\nthat there cannot be two events alike in all physical respects but\ndiffering in some mental respect, or that an object cannot alter in\nsome mental respect without altering in some physical respect (1970,\n214).\n\n\nAfter Davidson\u2019s appeal to supervenience, Terence Horgan (1982,\n1984), Jaegwon Kim (1984, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1993), David Lewis (1983),\nand others began to examine the notion of supervenience itself, and to\nexplore its usefulness for a wide variety of philosophical purposes.\nThe literature then mushroomed.\n",
