    "main_text": "The origin of the modal approach\n1. The origin of the modal approach\n\nIn traditional approaches to quantum measurement theory a central role\nis played by the projection postulate, which asserts that upon\nmeasurement the state of a physical system undergoes a discontinuous\nchange: it is projected (\u201ccollapses\u201d) onto an eigenstate\ncorresponding to the measurement result. This postulate leads to many\ndifficulties: When exactly does a collapse takes place? What defines a\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d as opposed to an ordinary physical\ninteraction? The postulate is especially worrying when applied to\nentangled compound systems whose components are well-separated in\nspace. For example, in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) experiment\nthere are strict correlations between two systems that have interacted\nin the past, in spite of the fact that the correlated quantities are\nnot sharply defined in the individual systems. The projection\npostulate in this case implies that the collapse resulting from a\nmeasurement on one of the systems instantaneously defines a sharp\nproperty in the distant other system. (See the discussion of the\ncollapse or projection postulate in the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory.)\n\nA possible way out of these problems was noticed by van Fraassen\n(1972, 1974, 1991), who proposed to eliminate the projection postulate\nfrom the theory and to give a probabilistic interpretation to the\nremaining formalism of unitary quantum mechanics. Van Fraassen\u2019s\ninterpretation relied on the distinction between the \u201cdynamical\nstate\u201d and the \u201cvalue state\u201d of a system at any\ninstant:\n\n The dynamical state determines what may be the\ncase: which physical properties the system may possess, and what\nprobabilities are attached to these possibilities.\n The value state represents what actually is the\ncase, that is, all the system\u2019s physical properties that are\nsharply defined at the instant in question.\n\n\nThe dynamical state is the ordinary quantum state that occurs in the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation (in non-relativistic quantum mechanics), i.\ne. a vector or density matrix in Hilbert space, with the proviso that\nit always evolves unitarily, so never collapses.\n\nThe motivation for distinguishing between dynamical and value state is\nthe idea that a system may have a sharp value of an observable even if\nits unitarily evolving state is not an eigenstate of that observable.\nThis thought contradicts the so-called \u201ceigenstate-eigenvalue\nlink\u201d, which says that a system possesses a sharp value of an\nobservable (namely, one of its eigenvalues) if and only if its quantum\nstate is the corresponding eigenstate. The modal approach accepts the\n\u201cif\u201d part, but denies the \u201conly if\u201d part of\nthis statement. Van Fraassen accordingly introduced the notion of\n\u201cvalue state\u201d: a system\u2019s physical properties (the\nsharply defined observables) are not one-to-one represented by the\ndynamical state, which occurs in the evolution equation, but by the\nvalue state, which typically differs from the dynamical state.\n\nVan Fraassen called his proposal \u201cmodal\u201d because it\nnaturally connects to a modal logic of quantum propositions. Indeed,\nthe dynamical state in general only tells us what is possible and\nspecifies probabilities for the various possibilities. According to\nvan Fraassen, this modal and probabilistic aspect is fundamental to\nquantum mechanics and should not be viewed as arising from an\nincompleteness of the description (see Bueno 2014 for the relation\nbetween this and van Fraassen\u2019s constructive empiricism).\n\nWhat then are the definite quantities and value states for a given\nsystem at a given time? Empirical adequacy requires that, in cases of\nmeasurement, the after-measurement value state of the measuring device\nshould correspond to a definite measurement result. Therefore, the\nscheme minimally has to generate the Born probability measure over\nvalue states that represent the possible measurement results. Van\nFraassen\u2019s interpretation did not go further than this; it did\nnot specify precise value states outside of measurement situations and\ndefended agnosticism about the properties of physical systems in\ngeneral (see Ruetsche 1996 for critical discussion concerning this\npoint).\n\nIt is easy to see how these ideas could motivate a program for\nproviding a more elaborate modal interpretation of quantum theory that\nassigns definite properties to physical systems even when no\nmeasurements are taking place. To this more general modal program we\nnow turn.\n",
