    "main_text": "The Debate After Davidson || Weakness of Will as Potentially Rational\n3.2 Weakness of Will as Potentially Rational\n\n\nThe \u201cexternalist turn\u201d toward downplaying the role of an \nagent\u2019s better judgment and emphasizing other psychic factors instead\nis connected to a second way in which some theorists writing after \nDavidson have dissented from his analysis. Davidson, as we saw, \nviewed akratic action as possible, but irrational. The weak-willed \nagent acts contrary to what she herself takes to be the balance of \nreasons; her choice is thus unreasonable by her own lights. On this \npicture, incontinent action is a paradigm case of practical \nirrationality. Many other theorists have agreed with Davidson on this\nscore and have taken akrasia to be perhaps the clearest \nexample of practical irrationality. But some writers (notably Audi \n1990, McIntyre 1990, and Arpaly 2000) have questioned whether akratic\naction is necessarily irrational. Perhaps we ought to leave \nroom, not just for the possibility of akratic action, but \nfor the potential rationality of akratic action.\n\n\nThe irrationality which is held necessarily to attach to akratic \naction derives from the discrepancy between what the agent judges to \nbe the best (or better) thing to do, and what she does. That is, her \naction is faulted as irrational in virtue of not conforming to her \nbetter judgment. But\u2014ask these critics\u2014what if her better\njudgment is itself faulty? There is nothing magical about an agent\u2019s \nbetter judgment that ensures that it is correct, or even warranted; \nlike any other judgment, it can be in error, or even unjustified. \n(Recall that by \u201cbetter judgment\u201d we meant, all along, \nonly \u201ca judgment as to which course of action is better,\u201d\nnot \u201ca superior judgment.\u201d) Where the agent\u2019s \nbetter judgment is itself defective, in doing what she deems herself \nto have insufficient reason to do, the agent may actually be doing \nwhat she has most reason to do. \u201cEven though the akratic agent \ndoes not believe that she is doing what she has most reason to do, it\nmay nevertheless be the case that the course of action that she is \npursuing is the one that she has \u2026 most reason to \npursue\u201d (McIntyre 1990, p. 385). In that sense the \nakratic agent may be wiser than her own better judgment.\n\n\nHow, concretely, could an agent\u2019s better judgment go astray in \nthis way? Perhaps her survey of what she took to be the relevant \nconsiderations did not include, or did not attach sufficient weight \nto, what were in fact significant reasons in favor of one of the \npossible courses of action. She may have overlooked these, or \n(wrongly) deemed them not to be reasons, or failed to appreciate \ntheir full force; and in that case her judgment of what it is best to\ndo will be incorrect. Consider, for example, Jonathan Bennett\u2019s \nHuckleberry Finn (Bennett 1974, discussed in \nMcIntyre 1990), who akratically fails to turn in his slave \nfriend Jim to the authorities. Huck\u2019s judgment that he ought to do \nso, however, was based primarily on what he took to be the force of \nMiss Watson\u2019s property rights; it ignored his powerful feelings of \nfriendship and affection for Jim, as well as other highly relevant \nfactors. His \u201cbetter judgment\u201d was thus not in fact a \nvery comprehensive judgment; it did not take into account the full \nrange of relevant considerations.\n\n\nOr consider Emily, who has always thought it best that she pursue a \nPh.D. in chemistry (Arpaly 2000, p. 504). When she revisits\nthe issue, as she does periodically, she discounts her increasing \nfeelings of restlessness, sadness, and lack of motivation as she \nproceeds in the program, and concludes that she ought to persevere. \nBut in fact she has very good reasons to quit the program\u2014her \ntalents are not well suited to a career in chemistry, and the people \nwho are thriving in the program are very different from her. If she \nimpulsively, akratically quits the program, purely on the basis of \nher feelings, Emily is in fact doing just what she ought to \n do.[13]\n That her action conflicts with her better judgment does not \nsignificantly impugn its rationality, given all the considerations \nthat do support her quitting the program. \u201cA theory of\nrationality should not assume that there is something special about \nan agent\u2019s best judgment. An agent\u2019s best judgment is just another \nbelief\u201d (Arpaly 2000, p. 512). Emily\u2019s action \nconflicts, then, with one belief she has; but it coheres with many \nmore of her beliefs and desires overall. So even though she may find \nher own action inexplicable or \u201csurd,\u201d she is in fact \nacting rationally, although she does not know it. Contra \nDavidson, \u201cwe can \u2026 act rationally just when we cannot \nmake any sense of our actions\u201d (Arpaly 2000, p. 513).\n\n\nIt is unclear, however, whether these arguments and examples are \nlikely to sway those who take akrasia to be a paradigm of \npractical irrationality. These dissenters stress the substantive \nmerits of the course of action the akratic agent follows. But \ntraditionalists may say that is beside the point: however well things\nturn out, the practical thinking of the akratic agent still exhibits \na procedural defect. Someone who flouts her own conclusion \nabout where the balance of reasons lies is ipso facto not \nreasoning well. Even if the action she performs is in fact supported \nby the balance of reasons, she does not think it is, and that is \nenough to show her practical reasoning to be faulty. The defenders of\nthe traditional conception of akrasia as irrational thus \nwish to grant special rational authority (in this procedural sense) \nto the agent\u2019s better judgment, even if they admit that such a \njudgment can be substantively incorrect. By contrast, the dissenters \n\u201c[do] not believe best judgments have any privileged \nrole\u201d (Arpaly 2000, p. 513). We see again the \ncontrast between \u201cinternalist\u201d and \n\u201cexternalist\u201d tendencies in the debates over weakness of \nwill.\n",
