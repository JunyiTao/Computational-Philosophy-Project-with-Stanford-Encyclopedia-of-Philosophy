N\u00e9gritude as politics\n\nIn 1956 Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire wrote a resounding public letter to\nMaurice Thorez, then the General Secretary of the French Communist\nParty, telling him that he was resigning from the party. He had been a\nmember for more than ten years and had been elected in 1946 as a\ncommunist mayor of Fort-de-France then as a Representative of France\nin the French Assembly. The three \u201cfathers\u201d of\nN\u00e9gritude found themselves members of the same French\nParliament: Senghor who had been elected a deputy from Senegal in 1946\nwas sitting with the Socialists and so was L\u00e9on Damas who got\nelected to represent Guiana in 1948.\n\nIn his Letter to Maurice Thorez, C\u00e9saire started by\nenumerating his many grievances against a communist party that had\nuncritically pledged total allegiance to Russia before he came to\n\u201cconsiderations related to [his] position as a man of\n color.\u201d[15]\n As a person of African descent, he declared, his position expressed\nthe singularity of a \u201csituation in the world which cannot be\nconfused with any other \u2026 of \u2026 problems which cannot be\nreduced to any other problem \u2026 [and] of [a] history,\nconstructed out of terrible misfortunes, that belong to no one\nelse\u201d (C\u00e9saire, 2010, 147). That is why \u201cblack\npeoples\u201d, he argued, needed to have their own organizations,\n\u201cmade for them, made by them, and adapted to ends that they\nalone [could] determine\u201d (C\u00e9saire, 2010, 148).\nC\u00e9saire insisted also that Stalinist\n\u201cfraternalism,\u201d with its notions of the \u201cadvanced\npeople\u201d who must help \u201cpeoples who are behind,\u201d says\nnothing different than \u201ccolonialist paternalism.\u201d\n(C\u00e9saire, 2010, 149)\n\nUltimately, what C\u00e9saire was seeking in formulations such as\n\u201cit should be Marxism and communism at the service of black\npeoples, not black peoples at the service of the doctrine\u201d was\nto define the notion of a people by means of culture rather than\npolitics. And consequently he was refusing to just dilute the cultural\ndimension of the existential response of black peoples to colonial\nnegation in Marxist universalism: C\u00e9saire\u2019s\n\u201cletter\u201d was also, eight years later, a political response\nto Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s Black Orpheus. Is my decision an\nexpression of \u201cprovincialism\u201d, C\u00e9saire asked at the\nend of his letter. \u201cNot at all\u201d, he answered. \u201cI am\nnot burying myself in a narrow particularism. But neither do I want to\nlose myself in an emaciated universalism. There are two ways to lose\noneself: walled segregation in the particular or dilution in the\n\u2018universal\u2019\u201d (C\u00e9saire, 2010, 152).\n\nC\u00e9saire called then for the promotion of an \u201cAfrican\nvariety of communism\u201d as a way of avoiding both pitfalls.\nSenghor also has insisted on an African socialism born of a\n\u201cNegro African re-reading of Marx.\u201d This African socialism\nof Senghor could be presented briefly in two fundamental points: first\nthe insistence that it is the early Marx who can truly inspire an\nAfrican doctrine of socialism, second the understanding that socialism\nis a natural development of African societies and cultures. So in\narticle titled \u201cMarxism and humanism\u201d and published in\n1948 in Revue socialiste (a Journal sponsored by the French\nSocialist Party) Senghor notes that which will later be the point of\ndeparture for Louis Althusser\u2019s reading of Marx: between the\nearly Marx and the Marx who writes The Capital,\nthere is an epistemological break. It is to be recalled here that in\n1844 in Paris, Marx wrote a certain number of texts that he just\nabandoned afterwards to \u201cthe criticism of the mice\u201d. Those\ntexts, known as The 1844 Manuscripts were later discovered\nand published in Leipzig in 1932. They manifest that Marx\u2019s\nthinking and language were then fundamentally ethical as he was\noutraged by human condition under capitalist regime characterized by\nreification and alienation: human beings are alienated because, Marx\nwrites, the product of their work sucks out their life force and\nstands in front of them as strange and hostile artifacts. Alienation\nis the sentiment of living in exile and imprisoned in a de-humanized\nworld. The Marx who writes the Capital will abandon that\nmoral language and analyze the condition of the working class through\ntechnical concepts, for example that of extortion of surplus value.\nWhile Althusser considered this break the advent of Marxist science as\nan \u201canti-humanist theory\u201d Senghor saw it as self-betrayal\nby Marx repudiating his identity as a philosopher and giving to his\nviews the appearance of dogmatic economic petrifactions. The task of\nan African re-reading of Marx is then\n\nTo save Marx the humanist, metaphysician, dialectician and artist\nfrom a narrowly materialist, economistic, positivist, realist\nMarxism;\nTo invent an African path to socialism which is inspired by black\nspiritualities, and which continues the tradition of communalism on\nthe continent.\n\n\nThe concept of alienation in particular, so central in the writings of\nthe early Marx are at the heart of Senghor\u2019s reflections on\nMarxism and liberation. Liberation for Senghor is liberation from all\nforces of alienation, natural and sociopolitical. And in his 1948\narticle he writes about the early works of Marx: \u201cFor us, men of\n1947, men living after two world wars, we who have just escaped the\nbloodthirsty contempt of dictators and who are threatened by other\ndictatorships, what profit is to be had in these works of youth! They\nso nicely encapsulate the ethical principles of Marx, who proposes as\nthe object of our practical activity the total liberation of\nman.\u201d In Senghor\u2019s vitalistic philosophy, total liberation\nwill be reached when the human being reaches the stage when her\nartistic end can now flourish, when the evolution from homo\nfaber to homo sapiens has now given birth to homo\nartifex.\n",
