    "main_text": "Causation || Causal Inference: Critical Phase\n5.1 Causal Inference: Critical Phase\n\nCausal inferences are the only way we can go beyond the evidence of\nour senses and memories. In making them, we suppose there is some\nconnection between present facts and what we infer from them.\nBut what is this connection? How is it established?\n\nIf the connection is established by an operation of reason or the\nunderstanding, it must concern either relations of ideas or\nmatters of fact.\n\nHume argues that the connection can\u2019t involve relations of\nideas. Effects are different events from their causes, so there is no\ncontradiction in conceiving of a cause occurring, and its usual effect\nnot occurring. Ordinary causal judgments are so familiar that we tend\nto overlook this; they seem immediate and intuitive. But suppose you\nwere suddenly brought into the world as an adult, armed with the\nintellectual firepower of an Einstein. Could you, simply by examining\nan aspirin tablet, determine that it will relieve your headache?\n\nWhen we reason a priori, we consider the idea of the object\nwe regard as a cause independently of any observations we have made of\nit. It can\u2019t include the idea of any other distinct\nobject, including the object we take to be its usual effect. But then\nit can\u2019t show us any \u201cinseparable and inviolable\nconnection\u201d\u2014any necessary\nconnection\u2014between those ideas. Trying to reason a\npriori from your idea of an aspirin, without including any\ninformation you have of its effects from your previous experience,\nyields only your simple ideas of its \u201csensible\nqualities\u201d\u2014its size, shape, weight, color, smell, and\ntaste. It gives you no idea of what \u201csecret powers\u201d it\nmight have to produce its usual effects. Hume concludes that a\npriori reasoning can\u2019t be the source of the connection\nbetween our ideas of a cause and its effect. Contrary to what the\nmajority of his contemporaries and immediate predecessors thought,\ncausal inferences do not concern relations of ideas.\n\nHume now moves to the only remaining possibility. If causal inferences\ndon\u2019t involve a priori reasoning about relations of\nideas, they must concern matters of fact and experience. When\nwe\u2019ve had many experiences of one kind of event constantly\nconjoined with another, we begin to think of them as cause and effect\nand infer the one from the other. But even after we\u2019ve had many\nexperiences of a cause conjoined with its effect, our inferences\naren\u2019t determined by reason or any other operation of the\nunderstanding.\n\nIn the past, taking aspirin has relieved my headaches, so I believe\nthat taking aspirin will relieve the headache I\u2019m having now.\nBut my inference is based on the aspirin\u2019s superficial sensible\nqualities, which have nothing to do with headache relief. Even if I\nassume that the aspirin has \u201csecret powers\u201d that are doing\nthe heavy lifting in relieving my headache, they can\u2019t be the\nbasis of my inference, since these \u201csecret powers\u201d are\nunknown.\n\nNonetheless, Hume observes, \u201cwe always presume, when we see like\nsensible qualities, that they have like secret powers, and expect that\neffects, similar to those we have experienced, will follow from\nthem\u201d (EHU 4.2.16/33). Since we neither intuit nor infer a\npriori that similar objects have similar secret powers, our\npresumption must be based in some way on our experience.\n\nBut our past experience only gives us information about objects as\nthey were when we experienced them, and our present experience only\ntells us about objects we are experiencing now. Causal inferences,\nhowever, do not just record our past and present experiences.\nThey extend or project what we have gathered from\nexperience to other objects in the future. Since it is not necessarily\ntrue that an object with the same sensible qualities will have the\nsame secret powers that past objects with those sensible qualities\nhad, how do we project those experiences into the future, to other\nobjects that may only appear similar to those we\u2019ve previously\nexperienced?\n\nHume thinks we can get a handle on this question by considering two\nclearly different propositions:\n\n(1)\nI\u2019ve found\nthat headache relief has always followed my taking\naspirin;\n\n\nand\n\n(2)\nTaking aspirin\nsimilar to the ones I\u2019ve taken in the past will relieve my\npresent headache.\n\n\nThere is no question that \u201cthe one proposition may be justly\ninferred from the other\u201d, and that \u201cit is always\ninferred\u201d. But since their connection obviously isn\u2019t\nintuitive, Hume challenges us to produce the \u201cchain of\nreasoning\u201d that takes us from propositions like (1) to\npropositions like (2) (EHU 4.2.16/34).\n\n(1) summarizes my past experience, while (2) predicts what will happen\nin the immediate future. The chain of reasoning I need must show me\nhow my past experience is relevant to my future experience. I need\nsome further proposition or propositions that will establish an\nappropriate link or connection between past and\nfuture, and take me from (1) to (2) using either demonstrative\nreasoning, concerning relations of ideas, or probable\nreasoning, concerning matters of fact.\n\nHume thinks it is evident that demonstrative reasoning can\u2019t\nbridge the gap between (1) and (2). However unlikely it may be, we can\nalways intelligibly conceive of a change in the course of nature. Even\nthough aspirin relieved my previous headaches, there\u2019s no\ncontradiction in supposing that it won\u2019t relieve the one\nI\u2019m having now, so the supposition of a change in the course of\nnature can\u2019t be proven false by any reasoning concerning\nrelations of ideas.\n\nThat leaves probable reasoning. Hume argues that there is no probable\nreasoning that can provide a just inference from past to future. Any\nattempt to infer (2) from (1) by a probable inference will be\nviciously circular\u2014it will involve supposing what we are trying\nto prove.\n\nHume spells out the circularity this way. Any reasoning that takes us\nfrom (1) to (2) must employ some connecting principle that\nconnects the past with the future. Since one thing that keeps us from\nmoving directly from past to future is the possibility that the course\nof nature might change, it seems plausible to think that the\nconnecting principle we need will be one that will assure us that\nnature is uniform\u2014that the course of nature won\u2019t\nchange\u2014something like this uniformity principle:\n\n[UP]\nThe future will be like the past.\n\n\nAdopting [UP] will indeed allow us to go from (1) to (2). But before\nwe can use it to establish that our causal inferences are determined\nby reason, we need to determine our basis for adopting it. [UP] is\nclearly not intuitive, nor is it demonstrable, as\nHume has already pointed out, so only probable arguments\ncould establish it. But to attempt to establish [UP] this way would be\nto try to establish probable arguments using probable arguments, which\nwill eventually include [UP] itself.\n\nAt this point, Hume has exhausted the ways reason might establish a\nconnection between cause and effect. He assures us that he offers his\n\u201csceptical doubts\u201d not as a \u201cdiscouragement, but\nrather an incitement \u2026 to attempt something more full and\nsatisfactory\u201d. Having cleared the way for his constructive\naccount, Hume is ready to do just that.\n",
