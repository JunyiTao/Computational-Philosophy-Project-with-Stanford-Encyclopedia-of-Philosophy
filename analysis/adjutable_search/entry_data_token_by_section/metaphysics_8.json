The modern\nidentity theory holds that all mental events or states are a special\nsort of physical event or state. The theory is parsimonious (among its\nother virtues) but we nevertheless exhibit a natural tendency to\ndistinguish the mental and the physical. Perhaps the reason for this\nis epistemological: whether our thoughts and sensations are physical\nor not, the kind of awareness we have of them is of a radically\ndifferent sort from the kind of awareness we have of the flight of a\nbird or of a flowing stream, and it seems to be natural to infer that\nthe objects of the one sort of awareness are radically different from\nthe objects of the other. That the inference is logically invalid is\n(as is so often the case) no barrier to its being made. Whatever the\nreason may be, philosophers have generally (but not universally)\nsupposed that the world of concrete particulars can be divided into\ntwo very different realms, the mental and the material. (As the\ntwentieth century passed and physical theory rendered\n\u201cmatter\u201d an increasingly problematical concept, it became\nincreasingly common to say \u201cthe mental and the physical\u201d.)\nIf one takes this view of things, one faces philosophical problems\nthat modern philosophy has assigned to metaphysics.\n\nProminent among these is the problem of accounting for mental\ncausation. If thoughts and sensations belong to an immaterial or\nnon-physical portion of reality\u2014if, for example, they are\nchanges in immaterial or non-physical substances\u2014how can they\nhave effects in the physical world? How, for example, can a decision\nor act of will cause a movement of a human body? How, for that matter,\ncan changes in the physical world have effects in the non-physical\npart of reality? If one\u2019s feeling pain is a non-physical event,\nhow can a physical injury to one\u2019s body cause one to feel pain?\nBoth questions have troubled \u201ctwo realm\u201d\nphilosophers\u2014or \u2018dualists\u2019, to give them their more\nusual name. But the former has troubled them more, since modern\nphysics is founded on principles that assert the conservation of\nvarious physical quantities. (See Bennett (2021) for discussion of the\ncomparative explanatory demands of physicalism and dualism.) If a\nnon-physical event causes a change in the physical\nworld\u2014dualists are repeatedly asked\u2014does that not imply\nthat physical quantities like energy or momentum fail to be conserved\nin any physically closed causal system in which that change occurs?\nAnd does that not imply that every voluntary movement of a human body\ninvolves a violation of the laws of physics\u2014that is to say, a\nmiracle?\n\nA wide range of metaphysical theories have been generated by the\nattempts of dualists to answer these questions. Some have been less\nthan successful for reasons that are not of much intrinsic\nphilosophical interest. C. D. Broad, for example, proposed (1925:\n103\u2013113) that the mind affects the body by momentarily changing\nthe electrical resistance of certain synapses in the brain, (thus\ndiverting various current pulses, which literally follow the path of\nleast resistance into paths other than those they would have taken).\nAnd this, he supposed, would not imply a violation of the principle of\nthe conservation of energy. But it seems impossible to suppose that an\nagent could change the electrical resistance of a physical system\nwithout expending energy in the process, for to do this would\nnecessitate changing the physical structure of the system, and that\nimplies changing the positions of bits of matter on which forces are\nacting (think of turning the knob on a rheostat or variable resistor:\none must expend energy to do this). If this example has any\nphilosophical interest it is this: it illustrates the fact that it is\nimpossible to imagine a way for a non-physical thing to affect the\nbehavior of a (classical) physical system without violating a\nconservation principle.\n\nThe various dualistic theories of the mind treat the interaction\nproblem in different ways. The theory called \u2018dualistic\ninteractionism\u2019 does not, of itself, have anything to say about\nthe problem\u2014although its various proponents (Broad, for example)\nhave proposed solutions to it. \u2018Occasionalism\u2019 simply\nconcedes that the \u201clocal\u201d counterfactual dependence of the\nbehavior of a physical system on a non-physical event requires a\nmiracle. The theory of pre-established harmony, which substitutes\n\u201cglobal\u201d for local counterfactual dependence of voluntary\nphysical movements on the mental states of agents, avoids problems\nwith conservation principles\u2014but secures this advantage at a\ngreat price. (Like occasionalism, it presupposes theism, and, unlike\noccasionalism, it entails either that free will does not exist or that\nfree will is compatible with determinism.)\n\u2018Epiphenomenalism\u2019 simply denies that the mental can\naffect the physical, and contents itself with an explanation of why\nthe mental appears to affect the physical.\n\nIn addition to these dualistic theories, there are monistic theories,\ntheories that dissolve the interaction problem by denying the\nexistence of either the physical or the non-physical: idealism and\nphysicalism. (Present-day philosophers for the most part prefer the\nterm \u2018physicalism\u2019 to the older term\n\u2018materialism\u2019 for reasons noted above.) Most current work\nin the philosophy of mind presupposes physicalism, and it is generally\nagreed that a physicalistic theory that does not simply deny the\nreality of the mental (that is not an \u201celiminativist\u201d\ntheory), raises metaphysical questions. Such a theory must, of course,\nfind a place for the mental in a wholly physical world, and such a\nplace exists only if mental events and states are certain special\nphysical events and states. There are at least three important\nmetaphysical questions raised by these theories. First, granted that\nall particular mental events or states are identical with particular\nphysical events or states, can it also be that some or all mental\nuniversals (\u2018event-types\u2019 and \u2018state-types\u2019\nare the usual terms) are identical with physical universals? Secondly,\ndoes physicalism imply that mental events and states cannot really be\ncauses (does physicalism imply a kind of epiphenomenalism)? Thirdly,\ncan a physical thing have non-physical properties\u2014might it be\nthat mental properties like \u201cthinking of Vienna\u201d or\n\u201cperceiving redly\u201d are non-physical properties of physical\norganisms? This last question, of course, raises a more basic\nmetaphysical question, \u2018What is a non-physical property?\u2019\nAnd all forms of the identity theory raise fundamental metaphysical\nquestions, ontological questions, questions like, \u2018What is an\nevent?\u2019 and \u2018What is a state?\u2019.\n",
