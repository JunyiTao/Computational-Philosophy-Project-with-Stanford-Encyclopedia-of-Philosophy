    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues || Necessity of Quantization\n5.6 Necessity of Quantization\n\nIn earlier research on quantum gravity it was often supposed that if\nthere was at least one quantum field in the world together with the\ngravitational field, then given the universal coupling of the\ngravitational field, it must follow that the quantization of the one\nfield somehow infects the gravitational field, implying that it must\nnecessarily have quantum properties too. The arguments basically\ninvolve the consideration of a mass prepared in a superposition of\nposition eigenstates. If the gravitational field remained classical\n(and, therefore, not constrained by the uncertainty relations) then\none could violate the uncertainty relations by simply making\nmeasurements of the gravitational field, discovering the properties of\nthe quantized matter to which it was coupled. However, all attempts at\nmaking this argument stick have so far failed, meaning that there is\nno logical necessity demanding that we quantize the gravitational\nfield. Given that we also seemingly lack experimental reasons for\nquantization of the gravitational field (since we have not observed\nevidence of its quantum properties), several physicists (and\nphilosophers) have questioned the programme as it stands. It is, they\nargue, a matter for experiment to decide, not logic. Note, however,\nthat this does not mean that the project of quantum gravity itself\nrests on unsteady ground: if there are quantum fields and\ngravitational fields in the world, then given the nature of gravity,\nwe need to say something about the manner in which they\ninteract. What is being questioned is whether this means that gravity\ncannot itself remain fundamentally classical while interacting with\nquantum fields. After all, as far as all our experiments show: gravity\nis classical and matter is quantum. This pessimistic argument is\nusually traced back to Rosenfeld, though he wavered somewhat on the\nmatter (see DeWitt and Rickles, 2011, p. 164 and p. 170, for\nRosenfeld\u2019s original arguments).\n\nIf it is to remain fundamentally classical, then there is the simple\nquestion of what such a classical gravitational field would couple to.\nThe quantum properties? That seems problematic for the reasons given\nabove. Moreover, given the form of the Einstein field equations, with\na classical c-number on the left hand side, that would mean equating a\nc-number with a q-number (i.e. a quantum operator). The standard way\nout of this problem is to couple the gravitational field instead to\nthe expectation value of the stress-energy tensor of some quantized\nmatter field. The expectation value is a c-number. There have been a\nvariety of arguments and no-go theorems against this so-called\nsemi-classical gravitational theory, most of which replay the kind of\nargument invoking violations of the uncertainty relations sketched\nabove (see Eppley and Hannah 1977, and Page and Geilker 1981).\nBasically, the upshot of the Eppley and Hannah paper is that, given\nthe coexistence of classical gravity and quantum fields, two things\ncan happen upon a gravitational field measurement: on the one hand the\nquantum wavefunction could collapse, in which case there is momentum\nnon-conservation. On the other hand, the measurement could leave the\nquantum wavefunction in a coherent state, in which case signals can be\nsent faster than light. Mattingly (2006) argues that, when properly\nanalyzed, the thought experiments employed by Eppley and Hannah\nviolate basic physical principles involving the construction of the\nequipment that would be needed to make the necessary field\nmeasurements \u2014 however, while not viewing the original\nsemi-classical approach as a viable option, Mattingly argues that an\nextension of the approach has the potential to reveal a viable theory\nof micro-gravity (see Mattingly 2010 and 2014). Adrian Kent has\nrecently argued that general hybrid classical/quantum theories\n(including those involving gravity) need not allow superluminal\nsignalling or violate relativity (Kent 2018).\n\nA batch of new approaches based on analogies with condensed matter\nphysics and hydrodynamics point to another way in which gravity can\nescape quantization, though not in a truly fundamental sense.\nAccording to such approaches, gravity is emergent in the sense that\nthe metric (or connection) variables, and other variables representing\ngravitational features, are collective variables that only appear at\nenergies away from the Planck scale. In other words, gravity is a\npurely macroscopic, low energy phenomenon and general relativity is an\neffective field theory. This leaves the task of actually filling in\nthe details of the microscopic structure of spacetime (the\n\u2018atoms of spacetime\u2019) out of which the low energy\ncollective variables emerge (see Hu, 2009, for a conceptually oriented\nreview of such approaches; Crowther 2014 provides a detailed\nphilosophical analysis). As Rovelli notes (2007, p. 1304), the mere\nfact that the gravitational field is an emergent, collective variable\ndoes not thereby imply an absence of quantum effects, and it is\npossible that collective variables too are governed by quantum\ntheory.\n\nW\u00fcthrich (2005, pp. 779\u201380) has argued that the very\nexistence of approaches to quantum gravity that do not involve the\nquantization of the gravitational field means that quantization of the\ngravitational field has to be a contingent matter. However,\nthis seems to rest on a mistake. It might still be the case that there\nare reasons of logical consistency forbidding the union of a classical\nand quantum field even though there are entirely distinct\nnon-quantization approaches. For example, string theory does not\nquantize the gravitational field; however, it is clearly wrong to say\nthat the existence of this position would be ruled out if the various\nno-go theorems outlawing hybrid classical-quantum theories were true.\nThe fact that one can isolate states corresponding to gravitons in the\nstring spectrum stands quite independent from issues over the\ninteraction of classical and quantum field. The question of the\nnecessity of quantization (as a result of coupling a classical\ngravitational field to quantum fields) should be held separate from\nthe prospect of producing a quantum theory of gravity that does not\ninvolve gravitational field quantization, for both input theories, for\ndescribing the classical and quantum fields, could be fundamentally\nwrong at high energies, requiring entirely new principles. However, a\nstronger argument against the impossibility hybrids is provided by\nJames Mattingly, who points out that since there are satisfiable\naxioms for semiclassical theories, inconsistency cannot be established\nin general (2009, p. 381).\n",
