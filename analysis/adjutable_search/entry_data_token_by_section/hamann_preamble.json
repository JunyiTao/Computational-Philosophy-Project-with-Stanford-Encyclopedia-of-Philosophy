    "main_text": "\n\nJohann Georg Hamann (1730\u20131788) lived and worked in Prussia, in\nthe context of the late German Enlightenment. Although he remained\noutside \u2018professional\u2019 philosophical circles, in that he\nnever held a University post, he was respected in his time for his\nscholarship and breadth of learning. His writings were notorious even\nin his own time for the challenges they threw down to the reader.\nThese challenges to interpretation and understanding are only\nheightened today.\n\nNevertheless an increasing number of scholars from philosophy,\ntheology, aesthetics and German studies are finding his ideas and\ninsights of value to contemporary concerns. His central preoccupations\nare still pertinent: language, knowledge, the nature of the human\nperson, sexuality and gender and the relationship of humanity to God.\nMeanwhile, his views, which in many respects anticipate later\nchallenges to the Enlightenment project and to modernity, are still\nrelevant and even provocative.\n",
