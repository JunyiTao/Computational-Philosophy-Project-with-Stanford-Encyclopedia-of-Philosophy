    "main_text": "Reconceptualizations of the Self || The Intersectional and Multiplicitous Self\n4. Conclusion\n\nAs this article attests, there is tremendous foment and variety within\nthe field of feminist work on the self. Yet, in reviewing this\nliterature, we have been struck by a recurrent theme: namely, the\ninextricability of metaphysical issues of the self from moral, social,\nand political theory. Feminist critiques of regnant philosophical\ntheories of the self expose the normative underpinnings of supposedly\nneutral metaphysics. Feminist analyses of women\u2019s agential\ncapacities both acknowledge traditional feminine social contributions\nand provide accounts of how women can overcome oppressive norms and\npractices. Feminist reconstructions of the nature of the self are\ninterwoven with arguments that draw out the emancipatory benefits of\nconceiving the self one way rather than another. There is nothing\nsurprising, to be sure, about the salience of normative concerns in\nfeminist philosophizing Still, we mention it because we believe that\nfeminists\u2019 attention to sociopolitical concerns leads to fresh\nquestions that enrich the philosophical understanding of the self.\nMoreover, we would urge that this forthrightness about the political\nviewpoint that informs philosophy s a virtue, for overlooking the\npolitical suppositions and implications of esoteric philosophical\nviews has led to considerable mischief. It is precisely the failure to\nacknowledge that the question of the self is not narrowly metaphysical\nthat has led to philosophy\u2019s implicit modeling of the self on a\nmale subject, a tendency that feminist perspectives on the self seek\nto remediate.\n",
