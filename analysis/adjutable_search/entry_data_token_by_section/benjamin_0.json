    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\nWalter Bendix Schoenflies Benjamin was born on July 15, 1892, the\neldest of three children in a prosperous Berlin family from an\nassimilated Jewish background. At the age of 13, after a prolonged\nperiod of sickness, Benjamin was sent to a progressive co-educational\nboarding school in Haubinda, Thuringia, where he formed an important\nintellectual kinship with the liberal educational reformer Gustav\nWyneken. On his return to Berlin, he began contributing to Der Anfang\n(\u2018The Beginning\u2019), a journal dedicated to Wyneken\u2019s\nprinciples on the spiritual purity of youth, articles which contain in\nembryonic form important ideas on experience and history that continue\nto occupy his mature thought. As a student at the universities of\nFreiburg im Breisgau and Berlin, Benjamin attended lectures by the\nneo-Kantian philosopher Heinrich Rickert and the sociologist Georg\nSimmel, whilst continuing to be actively involved in the growing Youth\nMovement. In 1914, however, Benjamin denounced his mentor and withdrew\nfrom the movement in response to a public lecture in which Wyneken\npraised the ethical experience that the outbreak of war afforded the\nyoung. In 1915 a friendship began between Benjamin and Gerhard (later\nGershom) Scholem, a fellow student at Berlin. This relationship would\nhave a lifelong influence upon Benjamin\u2019s relation to Judaism and\nKabbalism, notably in his interpretations of Kafka in the early 1930s\nand in the messianic interpretation of the Paul Klee painting Angelus Novus in\nhis later theses \u2018On the Concept of History\u2019. Scholem would\nprove instrumental in establishing and, in part, shaping the legacy of\nBenjamin\u2019s works after his death (Raz-Krakotzkin 2013). \n\nBenjamin\u2019s doctoral dissertation, \u2018The Concept of Art Criticism\nin German Romanticism\u2019, was awarded, summa cum laude, by\nthe University of Bern, Switzerland, in 1919. His celebrated essay on\nGoethe\u2019s novella, The Elective Affinities, was begun shortly\nafter and put into practice the theory of art criticism developed in\nhis dissertation. Benjamin\u2019s Habilitationsschrift on\nthe Origin of the German Mourning-Play (Ursprung des\ndeutschen Trauerspiels)\u2014the thesis which would have enabled\nhim to become a professional academic\u2014had, he feared, with the\ndeath of his intellectual ally, the Protestant theologian Florens\nChristian Rang, lost its \u201cproper reader\u201d (GB 3:16). In 1925, he was forced to withdraw his submission from the\nUniversity of Frankfurt am Main and with it the possibility of a\nfuture academic position. However, despite this academic\nfailure, an excerpt from the work appeared in a literary journal two\nyears later and the book was published the following year (1928),\nquickly receiving favourable attention in a number of well regarded\nnewspapers and periodicals in Germany and further afield (Brodersen\n1996, 154). In an ironic twist, Benjamin\u2019s\nfailed Habilitation study became the subject of a seminar\ncourse taught at Frankfurt University in 1932\u20133 by Theodor\nWiesengrund (later Theodor W. Adorno).\n\nMuch of the writing for his thesis was completed in 1924 on the Italian\nisland of Capri, where Benjamin had retreated for financial reasons.\nThe stay would prove decisive, however, since it was here he met the\nBolshevik Latvian theatre producer Asja Lacis, with whom he begun an\nerotically frustrated but intellectually productive relationship.\n\u2018Naples\u2019 was jointly written with Lacis in 1925, whilst One-Way Street,\na quasi-constructivist collection of fragments written between\n1923\u20131926 and dedicated to Lacis on its publication in 1928, and the\nunfinished Arcades Project,\nbegun in the late 1920s, both exhibit a modernist experimentation with\nform that can in part be attributed to Lacis\u2019 influence. His\nMarxist turn towards historical materialism was compounded by his\nenthusiastic study of Georg Luk\u00e1cs\u2019 History and Class Consciousness\nwhilst on Capri and a visit to Lacis in Soviet Moscow in the winter of\n1926\u20137.\nBy the early 1930s Benjamin was closely involved in the plans\nfor a left-wing periodical to be entitled \u2018Crisis and\nCritique\u2019, in collaboration with Ernst Bloch, Sigfried Kracauer\nand, among others, the Marxist poet, playwright and theatre director\nBertolt Brecht (Wizisla 2009, 66\u201398). Benjamin had been introduced\nto Brecht by Lacis in 1929 and over the following decade developed a\nclose personal friendship, in which their literary and political\naffinities had been cemented under the difficult conditions of\npolitical exile. Benjamin undertook a series of studies of\nBrecht\u2019s \u201cepic theatre\u201d and modelled the radio\nbroadcasts he wrote and presented during this period upon the\nlatter\u2019s experiments in theatrical didacticism (Brodersen\n1996, 193). In 1933, Benjamin departed Nazi Germany for the last time,\nfollowing Adorno, Brecht and many other Jewish friends into an exile he\ndivided between Paris, Ibiza, San Remo and Brecht\u2019s house near\nSvendborg, Denmark.\n\n\nDuring the 1930s the Institute for Social Research, by this point\nunder the directorship of Horkheimer and exiled from its base in the\nUniversity of Frankfurt, provided Benjamin with important\nopportunities for publishing as well as an increasingly necessary\nfinancial stipend.  Theodor W. Adorno, who had been introduced to\nBenjamin a decade earlier by a mutual friend, Siegfried Kracauer, was\ninstrumental in securing this support. An important consequence of\nthis dependence, however, was the editorial revisions to which key\nessays in which Benjamin developed his materialist theory of art were\nsubjected, such as \u2018The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technical\nReproducibility\u2019 and those on Baudelaire and Paris that grew out\nof The Arcades Project.\nWith the outbreak of war in 1939, Benjamin was temporarily interned\nin the French \u201cconcentration camps\u201d established for German\ncitizens. On his release a few months later he returned to Paris and\nthere continued his work in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale\non The Arcades Project.  The notes for his unfinished\nresearch were left in the safekeeping of librarian and friend, the\nwriter Georges Bataille, as Benjamin fled Paris before the advancing\nGerman army in the summer of 1940. The last few months of Benjamin\u2019s\nlife reflect the precarious experience of countless other Jewish\nGermans in Vichy France: a flight to the border and preparations for\nemigration by legal or illegal means. Lacking the necessary exit visa\nfrom France, he joined a guided party that crossed the Pyrenees in an\nattempt to enter Spain as illegal refugees. Turned back by customs\nofficials, Benjamin took his life in the small, Spanish border town of\nPort Bou, on September 27, 1940.\n\n",
