    "main_text": "The Ethics of Public Goods: Should the Government Pay for Public Goods? || The Market As a Discovery Process\n6.3 Market Norms and Other Norms\n\nSo far, we have looked at public goods mainly as economic goods that\nhave certain characteristics that give rise to doubts whether they can\nbe provided privately at efficient levels. The government might be\njustified in engaging in the production of a public good because it\ncorrects a market failure. Such an argument will always be contingent\non private actors\u2019 inability to produce the good or enough of\nit, which is why mechanisms that encourage private provision have been\nexamined at some length in\n Section 4\n above.\n\nSome philosophers have offered arguments to the effect that the\ngovernment should provide certain goods, independently of whether or\nnot they could be produced in sufficient quantities by the market.\nMichael Waltzer and Elizabeth Anderson have argued that the sphere of\nthe market should be limited because market norms do not embody\ncertain important values and market exchange may undermine ideals and\ninterests legitimately protected by the state (Walzer 1983, Anderson\n1993). According to Anderson, market norms have the following five\nfeatures: they are impersonal (independent of the relationship and of\nthe other party\u2019s ends), egoistic (the goal is to satisfy\none\u2019s personal interests), exclusive (defined as above),\nwant-regarding (as opposed to responsive to objective needs), and\noriented to \u201cexit\u201d rather than \u201cvoice\u201d (rather\nthan voicing one\u2019s complaint one seeks an alternative) (see\nAnderson 1993: 143\u20134).\n\nA good is an economic good according to Anderson if its\nproduction, distribution, and enjoyment are properly governed by\nmarket norms (Anderson 1993: 146). This contrasts with a number of\nother kinds of goods, such as gift goods. Friendly gift exchange\nshould be responsive to the personal characteristics of the receiver,\nand to the relationship itself, rather than \u201cimpersonal\u201d.\nIt should also express an understanding of the relationship and not\nmerely satisfy the receiver\u2019s subjective wants. Giving money is\noften regarded as offensive exactly because it ignores these\ncharacteristics of gift goods.\n\nWhat economists call public goods fall into Anderson\u2019s category\nof \u201cpolitical goods\u201d. They are characterised by three\nnorms that oppose the respective market norms (Anderson 1993: 159).\nFirst, one\u2019s freedom is exercised through voice rather than\nexit. Second, goods are distributed according to public principles\nrather than subjective wants. Third, the goods are provided on a\nnon-exclusive basis. About these goods she says:\n\n\nSome goods can be secured only through a form of democratic provision\nthat is nonexclusive, principle- and need- regarding, and regulated\nprimarily through voice. To attempt to provide these goods through\nmarket mechanisms is to undermine our capacity to value and realize\nourselves as fraternal democratic citizens. (Anderson 1993: 159)\n\n\nThe examples Anderson discusses in this section of her\nbook\u2014roads, parks, primary and secondary education\u2014are all\npublic goods in the economist\u2019s sense. Providing them privately\nwould undermine the \u201ccapacity to value and realize ourselves as\nfraternal democratic citizens\u201d because exercising freedom by\nvoice would be replaced by exit (e.g., when parents send their kids to\nschools that approximate their values better than others instead of\ncontributing to curricula through voice), by allowing owners to\ndictate terms on the basis of their wants instead of using principles\nsuch as freedom of speech and association (e.g., when owners of malls\nsuppress speech and political activity they find offensive), and by\nthe ability of owners to exclude non-payers instead of enabling all to\nmeet one another on terms of equality (e.g., in the case of\nparks).\n\nIn a similar vein, Angela Kallhoff argues that some (but not all)\npublic goods provide additional externalities that are essential for\nthe functioning of a democracy (Kallhoff 2011, 2014). Some public\ngoods constitute visible expressions of solidarity and social justice\namong citizens (\u201ccentral goods\u201d), some support\nconnectivity and serve as representations of shared interests\n(\u201cconnectivity goods\u201d), and some serve as visible\nrepresentations of a shared sense of citizenship\n(\u201cidentification goods\u201d). The absence of these goods would\nundermine the ability of the citizenry to engage in public\ndeliberation and develop a sense of self-determination.\n",
