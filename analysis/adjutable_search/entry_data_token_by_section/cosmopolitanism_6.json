    "main_text": "Objections to Cosmopolitanism || Economic cosmopolitanism\n3.2 Economic cosmopolitanism\n\n\nVarious arguments have been used to show that economic cosmopolitanism\nis not a viable option. Marx and later Marxists have argued that\ncapitalism is self-destructive in the long run, because the\nexploitation, alienation, and poverty that it inflicts on the\nproletariat will provoke a world-wide revolution that will bring about\nthe end of capitalism. In the twentieth century, when nationalist\ntendencies proved to be stronger (or in any case more easily mobilized)\nthan international solidarity, and when the position of workers was\nstrengthened to the point of making them unwilling to risk a\nrevolution, this forced the left to reconsider this view. \n\n\nCritics of the economic cosmopolitan ideal have also started to\nemphasize another way in which capitalism bears the seeds of its own\ndestruction within itself, namely, insofar as it is said to lead to a\nglobal environmental disaster that might spell the end of the human\nspecies, or in any event the end of capitalism as we know it. The\neffects of excessive consumption (in some parts of the world) and the\nexploitation of nature would make the earth inhospitable to future\nhuman generations.\n\n\nEven if one does not think that these first two problems are so\nserious as to make economic cosmopolitanism unviable, they can still\nmake it seem undesirable in the eyes of those who are\nconcerned with poverty, environmental destruction, and the impact of climate change.\n\n\nMoreover, there are several other concerns that lead critics to\nregard economic cosmopolitanism as undesirable. First among these is\nthe lack of effective democratic control by the vast majority of the\nworld\u2019s population, as large multinationals are able to impose demands\non states that are in a weak economic position and their populations,\ndemands that they cannot reasonably refuse to meet, although this does\nnot mean that they meet them fully voluntarily. This concerns, for\nexample, labor conditions or the use of raw materials in developing countries.\n\n\nSecond, economic cosmopolitans are accused of failing to pay attention\nto a number of probable side-effects of a global free market. In\nparticular, they are criticized for neglecting or downplaying issues\nsuch as (a) the vast inequality of wealth and extreme poverty without\nthere being any reliable mechanism to provide relief, if they reduce\nthe role of political institutions (b) the presupposition of\nlarge-scale migration or re-schooling when jobs disappear in one area\n(the loss of ties to friends and family, language, culture, etc., and\nthe monetary costs of moving or re-tooling), (c) the lack of a\nguarantee that there will be a sufficient supply of living-wage jobs\nfor all world citizens (especially given increasing automation. They\nare similarly accused of failing to take seriously the fact that there\nmight be circumstances under which it would be profitable for some\nstates to be protectionist or wage war, such as wars about markets or\nraw materials and energy (e.g., oil).\n",
