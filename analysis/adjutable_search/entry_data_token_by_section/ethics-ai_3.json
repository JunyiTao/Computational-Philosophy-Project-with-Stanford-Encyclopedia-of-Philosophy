    "main_text": "Main Debates\n2. Main Debates\n\nIn this section we outline the ethical issues of human use of AI and\nrobotics systems that can be more or less autonomous\u2014which means\nwe look at issues that arise with certain uses of the technologies\nwhich would not arise with others. It must be kept in mind, however,\nthat technologies will always cause some uses to be easier, and thus\nmore frequent, and hinder other uses. The design of technical\nartefacts thus has ethical relevance for their use (Houkes and Vermaas\n2010; Verbeek 2011), so beyond \u201cresponsible use\u201d, we also\nneed \u201cresponsible design\u201d in this field. The focus on use\ndoes not presuppose which ethical approaches are best suited for\ntackling these issues; they might well be virtue ethics (Vallor 2017)\nrather than consequentialist or value-based (Floridi et al. 2018).\nThis section is also neutral with respect to the question whether AI\nsystems truly have \u201cintelligence\u201d or other mental\nproperties: It would apply equally well if AI and robotics are merely\nseen as the current face of automation (cf. M\u00fcller\nforthcoming-b).\n",
