Ius gentium, ius ad bellum and the Enslavement of Amerindians, Africans, and Others\n\nAmong the most influential elements in the works from the School of\nSalamanca are those connected to what was called the ius\ngentium until the late eighteenth century but is nowadays\nreferred to as international law. Firstly, they separated the ius\ngentium from natural law, with which it had more or less been\nidentified with since the formulation of Roman Law; secondly, they\ndeveloped a martial law on the basis of quaestio 40 in the\nSecunda secundae of Thomas Aquinas\u2019s Summa\ntheologiae; and thirdly, they treated the alleged right to\nenslave non-European human beings.\n\nWhen James Brown Scott (1934: 3, 160) called Vitoria the father of\nmodern international law, it was mainly in reference to his lectures\non the problems associated with the Indies. Vitoria\u2019s opinions\non this matter loomed large in this debate. He addressed the Indies in\nthree relectiones: De temperantia (1537), De\nIndis (1539) and De iure belli (1539). In the first of\nthese he discussed cannibalism, while in the others he considered\nwhether a just war could be waged against indigenous peoples and\nwhether Spain\u2019s title to the Indies was valid. In addition,\nVitoria, lecturing on the Summa theologiae (1534), discussed\nevangelization. His account of the right to rule also extended to the\nrole of the clergy in evangelizing peoples who, before 1492, had never\nheard of Christ.\n\nAs mentioned above, in the first of his three lectures De\nIndis, delivered in the summer of 1539, he shows that the\nAmerindians were veri domini of their goods, even if they\nwere unbelievers, sinners and irrational (Vitoria 1991b:\n239\u2013250). He discussed the argument from Aristotle that\n\u201cbarbarians\u201d were little better than animals, madmen or\nthose lacking sense, then he turned to an argument of apologists for\nthe Conquista, claiming that Amerindians were infidels,\nliving in a perpetual state of mortal sin, requiring Christian\nintervention. He dismissed the argument from sin, on the grounds that\nsin did not cancel natural dominium. Brute beasts lacked such\nrights, but even children and the mad, although they had guardians,\nnevertheless had property rights. Aristotle wrote about those who\nneeded direction from others, but this did not negate ownership.\nVitoria extended rightful ownership even to Saracens. He blamed the\npoor education of indigenous peoples, which he compared to that of\nmany European peasants, for their depraved condition. Slavery, he\nadded, was a legal or civil construct. No one was a slave by\nnature.\n\nThe second lecture lists seven \u201cunjust titles\u201d for the war\nagainst the Amerindians. Vitoria rejected the idea that either the\nemperor or the pope is master of the world. He denied that Emperor\nCharles V could take away the domains of others. He cited Juan de\nTorquemada\u2019s Summa de ecclesia to prove that the\npope\u2019s supremacy was spiritual, not temporal; and he maintained\nthat the pope could not force unbelievers to convert. According to\nVitoria, discovery was not a justification for conquest; and he\nrefuted the view that sins against nature like cannibalism and incest,\nwhich were exceptions to the natural immunity that canon law allowed\nto non-believers, justified conquest. There were sinners in every\nnation, but the pope was not entitled to wage war against Christians\nwho were guilty of sin. Furthermore, neither the alleged voluntary\nchoice of the Amerindians nor the idea of a gift from God could\njustify the conquest of their territory (ibid., 252\u2013276).\n\nThe third lecture, finally, lists eight \u201cjust titles\u201d for\nthe war against Amerindians, among them the violation of the right of\nSpaniards to travel in the Indies and to conduct missions, the\nprotection of innocents, etc. (ibid., 278\u2013291). Vitoria argued\nfor free intercourse between all peoples: indigenous rulers could not\nexclude Christians from their lands, and Christian travelers attacked\nby the local inhabitants had the right of self-defense. Spanish\nchildren born in the New World were able to choose, under natural law\nand the ius gentium, to become citizens of the country where\nthey resided. Vitoria also argued for the right to evangelize.\nChristians could intervene to protect converts, allies and friends. He\nwarned, however, that waging war on indigenous peoples might obstruct\nconversion. Vitoria weakened his defense of the Indians by saying that\nSpain might govern them for their own benefit. The indigenous peoples\nmight even be treated \u201cpartly as slaves\u201d. Moreover, once\nlarge-scale conversions had taken place, Spain could not abandon the\nNew World.\n\nIn De temperantia Vitoria stated that all nations regarded\ncannibalism as an abomination. A prince might convert and suppress\nevil customs like human sacrifice on the grounds of justice; but\nforeign princes could not intervene. Vitoria also dismissed arguments\nfrom sins against nature as calumnies intended to excuse warfare and\nplunder.\n\nVitoria and the other authors of the School of Salamanca dealt with\nmartial law and developed a theory of just wars that was, on the one\nhand, based on Thomas Aquinas\u2019s arguments and, on the other\nhand, built on the foundation of the \u201cclassical doctrine of just\nwar\u201d (Orend 2006). Vitoria dealt with just war in his lecture\nDe Indis relectio posterior sive De iure belli. He discusses\nwho can wage war\u2014private persons only for self-defense, the\ncommonwealth and the prince also for other reasons (Vitoria 1991b,\n299\u2013302); what cannot be considered just reasons for waging war,\nsuch as difference in religion and enlargement of empire (ibid.,\n302\u2013304); what can be done in a just war (ibid., 304\u2013306,\n314\u2013317); and the view that it may not be enough if a prince\nbelieves that his war is just (ibid., 306\u2013307).\n\nVitoria regarded a \u201cperfect\u201d commonwealths as able to\ndefend themselves from internal and external threats. The right of\nself-defense permitted the use of force to repel force. A society,\npagan or Christian, could wage a just war in self-defense and execute\nmalefactors. Vitoria accepted repelling invaders and avenging injury\nas justifications for war, but not the invasion of realms in order to\nacquire land, slaves or plunder. Religious difference and the\nvainglory of princes were also not sufficient reasons. Those in\nauthority could declare and wage war, but they should take counsel\nabout this. Subjects could not refuse service in a just war. All\nnecessary means were acceptable in a just conflict, even entering an\nenemy\u2019s territory. Vitoria, however, applied a criterion of\nproportional harm to wars, so that a war was unjust if it caused more\nharm than good. Moreover, a ruler who had waged an unjust war was\nobliged to make restitution. Booty could recompense property unjustly\nseized by an enemy, but only if taken on a superior\u2019s orders.\nVitoria permitted enslaving Saracens defeated in a just conflict, but\nhe denied that Christians could enslave other Christians. Moreover, he\ndenounced devices used in capturing slaves for export. Overall,\nChristians were expected to abide by the rules of war, showing\nmoderation and humility when victorious.\n\nSimilar ideas\u2014legitimate authority; just cause, which only one\nside can have; trying all other ways of conflict resolution;\netc.\u2014can be found in Su\u00e1rez\u2019s De bello,\nthe thirteenth disputation of his De caritate. Molina,\nhowever, seems to have believed that, at least from a subjective point\nof view, both sides may believe that their cause is just (Fernandes\n2014).\n\nAccording to Molina, moreover, the ius gentium was not\nentirely a part of natural law, since it affirmed natural principles\nbut also embodied positive laws, including private property and\nslavery. Generally, it was in the period between Vitoria and\nSu\u00e1rez that natural law was separated from the ius\ngentium, further divided by Su\u00e1rez into the ius supra\ngentes (the law above nations) and the ius inter gentes\n(the law among nations), which eventually became international law in\nthe strict sense. Natural law and ius gentium were quite\nclose to each other in Roman law and in Thomas Aquinas; but Vitoria,\nin his commentary on quaestio 57 in the Secunda\nsecundae of the Summa theologiae, already maintained\nthat, for Thomas, the ius gentium was part of positive law.\nSu\u00e1rez makes it clear that, in contrast to natural law, which\nis inscribed in the heart of human beings and is immutably valid for\nall of them, the ius gentium is a positive convention among\npeoples or nations, which is valid for all or nearly for all of them;\nit includes the right to punish those who are defeated in a just war\nand, therefore, also the right of enslavement (De legibus II\nxviii 8).\n\nIt was furthermore the consensus among a majority of authors in the\nSchool of Salamanca that no wars could be waged against non-Christians\nby reason of their infidelity and that hostile actions could be\nresisted in self-defense. As we have seen, however, this natural\nimmunity did not extend to permitting cannibalism or human sacrifice.\nMolina, who favored the right to evangelize and permitted armed\nprotection for missionaries, was more wary than Vitoria of making free\ncommerce a right enforceable by war, using arguments which are\nsomewhat similar to those of Immanuel Kant, limiting\n\u201ccosmopolitan right \u2026 to conditions of universal\nhospitality\u201d in his treatise Toward Perpetual Peace\n(Kant 1795 [1996: 328\u2013331; Ak. 8:357\u2013360]). For Molina as\nfor Kant, the locals have merely charitable obligations towards those\nwho are arriving in their territories, if they are in need. They have\nno obligation to open them their ports. Countries might refuse to\ntrade if they feared that commerce was an excuse for conquest (Molina,\nDe iustitia et iure II 105). Just wars could be waged by\nrulers, but hating the enemy was prohibited. Subjects were obliged to\ninquire about a ruler\u2019s decision to wage a just war if there was\n\u201chonest doubt\u201d about it. Molina was willing to concede to\nthe pope a role mediating between Christian rulers, but he warned\nagainst intervening directly in their squabbles.\n\nOne of the recurring questions with respect to the treatment of\nindigenous peoples was whether their enslavement as slaves by nature\nin the traditional Aristotelian sense was justified. As mentioned\nabove, a famous discussion of this issue took place at the Junta of\nValladolid, when the Aristotelian Juan Gin\u00e9s Sep\u00falveda\ndebated with the Dominican Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, an ardent\ndefender of the Amerindians and their rights. Sep\u00falveda argued\nthat the Amerindians, as barbarians, were slaves by nature, more or\nless on the level of beasts. Las Casas maintained that although there\nwere humans so simple-minded that they could be considered slaves by\nnature, such people existed in Spain as well as in the Americas (Hanke\n1959: 28\u201374).\n\nSoto, who also participated in the debate in Valladolid, said that the\nius gentium was a universally applicable form of positive\nhuman law, which was created by applying reason to natural principles.\nThis law governed trade, exchange of envoys and even slavery, if it\nspared lives during war. It also included respect for property, even\nof non-Christians, to avoid squabbles over possessions. Nor was\nconversion a just reason for going to war and enslaving conquered\npeoples.\n\nSoto once considered going to the New World to resolve the\ncontroversies there. Unable to go himself, he advocated sending good\nmissionaries. In addition, his writings were employed by the Third\nMexican Council (1585) in preparation of a confessors\u2019 manual\ngeared to a world of both Hispanic and Amerindian residents (Salcedo,\nDirectorio para Confesores). Soto\u2019s relectio\non dominion concluded that Spain\u2019s title to the Indies was hard\nto justify. He rejected the opinion of Sep\u00falveda on the justice\nof waging war on infidels, also Pope Alexander VI\u2019s division of\noverseas domains between Spain and Portugal. Soto was trusted by all\nparticipants in the Junta of Valladolid to summarize the conflicting\nopinions of Las Casas and Sep\u00falveda, though he, or perhaps Cano\n(Cano 1605), another critic of conquest, may have been the one person\nwho, according to Sep\u00falveda, opposed him. The Dominicans of\nSalamanca continued to argue for just conduct by Spaniards in their\noverseas dominions; and also Jesuits like Molina, even in their\ndefense of slavery and slave trade, did not refer to the concept of\nslaves by nature. Soto, though accepting slavery, rejected the idea of\nnatural slavery: in his view, human beings who were incapable of\nleading their own lives clearly had to be guided by wiser men, but for\nreasons of their own well-being, not as living tools in the\nAristotelian sense. So, slavery for him was merely conventional.\n\nMolina, who wrote the first treatise on the Portuguese transatlantic\nslave trade, followed Soto on this point, accepting only conventional\nslavery. He justified slavery and mentioned the four just titles for\nenslavement: committing certain crimes; being captured in a just war;\nselling oneself because of urgent need; and the principle of\npartus sequitur ventrem, that is, the children of enslaved\nmothers also are slaves (De iustitia et iure II disp. 33).\nThen he described the history of the Portuguese slave trade and gave a\ncritical evaluation of it (ibid., disp. 34\u201335). Interestingly,\nalthough he dealt intensively with the transatlantic slave trade,\nespecially from Africa, he never put forward a justification for\nenslavement based on race such as Noah\u2019s curse on the children\nof Ham (Genesis 9:20\u201327) for mocking his drunken nakedness.\n\nIt may be, at first glance, astonishing that the impact of what we\ntoday call race\u2014as stated above, the term mostly used until the\nsecond half of the eighteenth century was\n\u201cnation\u201d\u2014was increasingly used among the Jesuit\nauthors following Molina, although they were referring to his relevant\ndisputations (De iustitia et iure II disp. 33\u201340).\nAlonso de Sandoval (1577\u20131652), e.g., who spent most of his life\nin Cartagena (Columbia) and was named defensor de los negros,\nwrote very doleful and touching passages about the terrible situation\nof the black slaves in South America. But he had no doubt that their\nenslavement was just, using Noah\u2019s curse as one of the reasons\nfor this (Sandoval 1627, I 2, I 3, I 17, II 2), Haar & Kaufmann\n2023: Kap. 2.4.1.). Diego de Avenda\u00f1o (1594\u20131688) was\nraised by the Jesuits in Lima, where he became professor of theology\nand rector of the Col\u00e9gio Maximo de San Pablo de Lima,\npositions he held until his death. In his Thesaurus Indicus\nin a section entitled \u201cDe contractibus Aethiopum\u201d, he\nholds, on the one hand, that contracts with Africans on enslavement\nbear an enormous risk for a Christian conscience because they hardly\never fulfill the criteria of justice (Avenda\u00f1o 1668: Lib. I\nTitulus IX, cap. XII. n. 180 [2001: 324]). On the other hand, he\ndeclares that those contracts are \u201csomehow\u201d\n(aliqualiter) justifiable for a number of reasons, one of\nwhich is that Africans are born to serve and are the \u201cleast\namong men\u201d (vilissimi inter homines) (ib. n. 204, p.\n330, Haar & Kaufmann 2023: Kap. 2.4.2.). Obviously, the\n\u201cnecessity\u201d of justifying the discriminatory treatment of\nAfrican people via their alleged shortcomings became more and more\nurgent the longer the cruel exploitation, which contradicted all\nhumanitarian and Christian principles, lasted.\n",
