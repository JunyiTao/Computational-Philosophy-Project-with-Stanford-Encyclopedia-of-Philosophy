    "main_text": "Early Philosophical Concerns about Online Social Networks || Hubert Dreyfus on Internet Sociality: Anonymity versus Commitment\n2.2 Hubert Dreyfus on Internet Sociality: Anonymity versus Commitment\n\nPhilosopher Hubert Dreyfus (2001) shared Borgmann\u2019s early\ncritical suspicion of the ethical possibilities of the Internet; like\nBorgmann, Dreyfus\u2019s reflections on the ethical dimension of\nonline sociality conveyed a view of such networks as an impoverished\nsubstitute for the real thing. Like Borgmann, Dreyfus\u2019s\nsuspicion was informed by his phenomenological roots, which led him to\nfocus his critical attention on the Internet\u2019s suspension of\nfully embodied presence. Yet rather than draw upon Heidegger\u2019s\nmetaphysical framework, Dreyfus (2004) reached back to Kierkegaard in\nforming his criticisms of life online. Dreyfus asserts that what\nonline engagements intrinsically lack is exposure to risk,\nand without risk, Dreyfus tells us, there can be no true meaning or\ncommitment found in the electronic domain. Instead, we are drawn to\nonline social environments precisely because they allow us to\nplay with notions of identity, commitment and meaning,\nwithout risking the irrevocable consequences that ground real\nidentities and relationships. As Dreyfus put it:\n\n\u2026the Net frees people to develop new and exciting selves. The\nperson living in the aesthetic sphere of existence would surely agree,\nbut according to Kierkegaard, \u201cAs a result of knowing and being\neverything possible, one is in contradiction with oneself\u201d\n(Present Age, 68). When he is speaking from the point of view of the\nnext higher sphere of existence, Kierkegaard tells us that the self\nrequires not \u201cvariableness and brilliancy,\u201d but\n\u201cfirmness, balance, and steadiness\u201d (Dreyfus 2004, 75)\n\n\nWhile Dreyfus acknowledges that unconditional commitment and\nacceptance of risk are not excluded in principle by online\nsociality, he insists that \u201canyone using the Net who was led to\nrisk his or her real identity in the real world would have to act\nagainst the grain of what attracted him or her to the Net in the first\nplace\u201d (2004, 78).\n",
