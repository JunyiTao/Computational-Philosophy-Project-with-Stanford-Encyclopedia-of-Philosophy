If it\u2019s yours, then clearly you should\nget to decide the rules \u2013 haircuts, tattoos, piercings, sex\nhormones, giving and taking blood. All else equal, no one can tell you\nwhat to do with your body. But if it\u2019s a temple to someone\nelse \u2013 say, God \u2013 then the choice is not really\nyours to make. You\u2019re the custodian, not the caller of shots,\nand you should treat your body with the same kind of gingerly respect\nthat you would show as a guest in someone else\u2019s home. Their\ntemple, their rules.\n\nNowadays, few Western ethicists would argue that you should treat your\nbody in such-and-such a way purely because of divine authority\n(\u201cGod abhors tattoos!\u201d) or natural teleology (\u201cYour\nblood belongs in your own body!\u201d). But the history of\nphilosophy teems with prim pronouncements on the proper way to treat\none\u2019s body, and philosophers continue to debate whether certain\nkinds of bodily modification are immoral as a matter of duty to\noneself, as well as whether certain kinds of self-enhancement are\npermissible or even obligatory.\n\n\u201cBody modification,\u201d in this context, means a change to\none\u2019s body that needn\u2019t be intrinsically harmful, all\nthings considered. We are interested in the modifying itself, not just\nin the obvious harms it might involve. Decapitation\n\u201cmodifies\u201d the body, but has little in common, morally\nspeaking, with nail-clipping, haircuts, pierced ears, and the removal\nof teeth.\n\nOn Kant\u2019s view, however, decapitation and tooth-removal seem to\ndiffer only by a matter of degree. He writes:\n\nTo deprive oneself of an integral part or organ (to maim oneself)\n\u2013 for example, to give away or sell a tooth to be transplanted\ninto another\u2019s mouth, or to have oneself castrated in order to\nget an easier livelihood as a singer, and so forth \u2013 are ways of\npartially murdering oneself. (MM 6:423)\n\n\nClearly, Kant has in mind an unwaivable duty not to take out\none\u2019s body parts. Donating or selling a tooth is immoral \u2013\neven, apparently, when the transaction is consensual and mutually\nbeneficial. Kant then qualifies:\n\nBut to have a dead or diseased organ amputated when it endangers\none\u2019s life, or to have something cut off that is a part but not\nan organ of the body, for example, one\u2019s hair, cannot be counted\nas a crime against one\u2019s own person \u2013 although cutting\none\u2019s hair in order to sell it is not altogether free from\nblame. (MM 6:423)\n\n\nFor Kant, an appendectomy isn\u2019t partial murder, but there is\nsomething wrong with haircuts for paychecks. It is hard to see this as\nanything but natural teleology: it is not up to you what your\norgans are meant to do, and you may not make unnatural changes to your\nbody except to correct for defects \u2013 a version of \u201cyour\nbody is a temple,\u201d where the holiness comes from the value of\nbeing a person: \u201cdisposing of oneself as a mere means to some\ndiscretionary end is debasing humanity in one\u2019s person (homo\nnoumenon), to which the human being (homo phaenomenon)\nwas nevertheless entrusted for preservation\u201d (MM\n6:423). Here Kant sounds less like an Enlightenment thinker and more\nlike a natural lawyer (see, e.g., the discussion of self-love and\nsuicide in St. Thomas Aquinas\u2019s Summa Theologica, part\nII, Q64, A5, as cited in Cholbi 2017, sec. 2.2).\n\nSuffice it to say, Kant\u2019s view has problems. First, it\ndoesn\u2019t take bodily autonomy seriously. If you like spa days\nmore than long hair, why shouldn\u2019t you get to sell your hair and\ntreat yourself to a getaway? Second, the view doesn\u2019t generalize\nvery well. If it\u2019s wrong to sell one\u2019s body parts,\nshouldn\u2019t it also be wrong to sell one\u2019s labor,\nsince labor involves moving and using one\u2019s body, sometimes in\nunnatural ways? (Think of the nurse who takes caffeine pills to work\nthe night shift in a pandemic.) Finally, we might wonder why the\nprofit motive should be uniquely dubious. It\u2019s fine to cut\none\u2019s hair because one likes the look \u2013 why is this any\nnobler than trying to make a buck?\n\nA more promising prohibition can be found in Matej\nC\u00edbik\u2019s (2020) recent work on tattoos. A tattoo typically\nexpresses something about the bearer\u2019s personality. That\u2019s\nfine, C\u00edbik thinks, if the tattoo is discreet and the risk of\nregret is negligible, as when the tattoo represents an enduring aspect\nof the bearer\u2019s identity. The problem is that tattoos may\noutlive their inspiration, staying frozen even as identities evolve.\nRemoving tattoos can be painful, expensive, or impossible.\n\nConsider C\u00edbik\u2019s example of Amy, an 18-year-old girl who\n\u201cdesperately falls in love\u201d with a trendy musician named\nJustin:\n\nAmy listens to his music all the time, he is all that she ever reads\nabout, and his face is the main decoration of her room. Now she\ndecides to go further and get a series of tattoos with his image and\nhis name on the most prominent parts of her body including her face,\nshoulders, neck and hands. With these tattoos, she will be instantly\nrecognizable as his biggest fan, signaling her deep affection towards\nher idol \u2013 something that her (present) identity is build upon\n[sic]. (2020, 202)\n\n\nC\u00edbik thinks Amy acts wrongly. Her tattoos are\n\u201cinconsiderate\u201d towards her future self and \u201ca\ndefinition of recklessness,\u201d since she is \u201cbinding\n[herself] forever to publicly exhibit devotion to a fleeting\npop-culture phenomenon\u201d (2020, 204).\n\nThis diagnosis dovetails with Schofield on obligations to oneself in\nthe future. Schofield thinks there is something dangerous about\nactions that \u201cjeopardize a person\u2019s ability to make use of\nher practical powers later in life by harming or altering her body in\nthe present\u201d (2021, 167), since it one can reasonably demand\nfrom their own future perspective that such harms not be inflicted.\nSchofield illustrates with an analogy:\n\nJust as Beast, through his superior strength, can impose his will on\nBelle by picking her up and locking her in the tower, a person is able\nto impose her present will on herself in the future by affecting her\nown body \u2013 only in this latter case, it is the way she is\ntemporally situated, and not her superior strength, that explains her\npower and her dominance. (2021, 168)\n\n\nThe thing about tattoos, and body modification in general, is that the\nact itself is not particularly harmful; what matters is the\nrestriction on future freedom. A Justin Bieber face tattoo might not\nhurt much, but it makes it a lot harder to work in sales or run for\npublic office.\n\nWe should also note some of the points that could be made in defense\nof tattoo art, and self-expression more generally. First, whenever one\n\u201cseizes the day\u201d \u2013 putting down the books to go to a\nparty, moving countries to pursue a romance \u2013 one is sacrificing\nfuture options for the sake of savoring the present. Such trade-offs\nare part of any human life worth living. Second, even if you sometimes\nowe it to yourself to keep your options open, it might matter\nhow they are closed. Consider the gay man who refuses to hide\nhis sexuality to get ahead in the office, or the black woman who wears\nher curly natural hair in interviews even though some potential\nemployers see it as \u201cunprofessional.\u201d Here self-respect\nseems to tell in favor of acting in ways that foreclose\none\u2019s options, because the closing is achieved not by\none\u2019s choice, but through others\u2019 bigoted reactions. This\nmay be closer to how some people (especially those from cultures with\ntraditional tattoos, as in Samoan culture) think of being denied a job\non the basis of body art: the problem isn\u2019t teenage\nrecklessness, but arbitrary discrimination.\n\nStill, when it comes to thoughtless, permanent changes to one\u2019s\nown appearance, C\u00edbik and Schofield are definitely on to\nsomething. What remains to be seen is how we might reconcile the value\nof spontaneous expression with a chilly concern for future freedom. A\nblanket ban on body modification is surely too strict \u2013 but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean anything goes.\n",
