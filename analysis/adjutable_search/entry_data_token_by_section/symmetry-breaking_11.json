General Philosophical Questions\n\nMuch of the recent philosophical literature on symmetries in physics\ndiscusses specific symmetries and the intepretational questions they\nlead to. The rich variety of symmetries in modern physics means that\nquestions concerning the status and significance of symmetries in\nphysics in general are not easily addressed. However, something can be\nsaid in more general terms and we offer a few remarks in that\ndirection here, starting with the main roles that symmetry plays in\nphysics.\n\nOne of the most important roles played by symmetry is that of\nclassification \u2014 for example, the classification of\ncrystals using their remarkable and varied symmetry properties. In\ncontemporary physics, the best example of this role of symmetry is the\nclassification of elementary particles by means of the irreducible\nrepresentations of the fundamental physical symmetry groups, a result\nfirst obtained by Wigner in his famous paper of 1939 on the unitary\nrepresentations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group. When a symmetry\nclassification includes all the necessary properties for\ncharacterizing a given type of physical object (for example, all\nnecessary quantum numbers for characterizing a given type of\nparticle), we have the possibility of defining types of entities on\nthe basis of their transformation properties. This has led\nphilosophers of science to explore a structuralist approach to the\nentities of modern physics, in particular a group-theoretical account\nof objects (see the contributions in Castellani, 1998, Part II). The\nrelation between symmetry, group and structure and its exploitation in\nstructuralist approaches, especially in the framework of structural\nrealism, is a much debated issue. See, for example, Roberts (2011),\nFrench (2014) and Caulton (2015), and the SEP entry\n Structural Realism.\n\nSymmetries also have a normative role, being used as\nconstraints on physical theories. The requirement of invariance with\nrespect to a transformation group imposes severe restrictions on the\nform that a theory may take, limiting the types of quantities that may\nappear in the theory as well as the form of its fundamental equations.\nA famous case is Einstein\u2019s use of general covariance when\nsearching for his gravitational equations.\n\nThe group-theoretical treatment of physical symmetries, with the\nresulting possibility of unifying different types of symmetries by\nmeans of a unification of the corresponding transformation groups, has\nprovided the technical resources for symmetry to play a powerful role\nin theoretical unification. This is best illustrated by the\ncurrent dominant research programme in theoretical physics aimed at\narriving at a unified description of all the fundamental forces of\nnature (gravitational, weak, electromagnetic and strong) in terms of\nunderlying local symmetry groups.\n\nIt is often said that many physical phenomena can be explained as\n(more or less direct) consequences of symmetry principles or symmetry\narguments. In the case of symmetry principles, the\nexplanatory role of symmetries arises from their place in the\nhierarchy of the structure of physical theory, which in turn derives\nfrom their generality. As Wigner (1967, pp. 28ff) describes the\nhierarchy, symmetries are seen as properties of the laws. Symmetries\nmay be used to explain (i) the form of the laws, and (ii) the\noccurrence (or non-occurrence) of certain events (this latter in a\nmanner analogous to the way in which the laws explain why certain\nevents occur and not others). In the case of symmetry arguments, we\nmay, for example, appeal to Curie\u2019s principle to explain the\noccurrence of certain phenomena on the basis of the symmetries (or\nasymmetries) of the situation, as discussed in section 3, above.\nFurthermore, insofar as explanatory power may be derived from\nunification, the unifying role of symmetries also results in an\nexplanatory role.\n\nFrom these different roles we can draw some preliminary conclusions\nabout the status of symmetries. It is immediately apparent that\nsymmetries have an important heuristic function, indicating a strong\nmethodological status. Is this methodological power connected to an\nontological or epistemological status for symmetries?\n\nAccording to an ontological viewpoint, symmetries are seen as\na substantial part of the physical world: the symmetries of theories\nrepresent properties existing in nature, or characterize the structure\nof the physical world. It might be claimed that the ontological status\nof symmetries provides the reason for the methodological success of\nsymmetries in physics. A concrete example is the use of symmetries to\npredict the existence of new particles. This can happen via the\nclassificatory role, on the grounds of vacant places in symmetry\nclassification schemes, as in the famous case of the 1962 prediction\nof the particle Omega- in the context of the hadronic\nclassification scheme known as the \u201cEightfold Way\u201d. (See\nBangu, 2008, for a critical analysis of the reasoning leading to this\nprediction.) Or, as in more recent cases, via the unificatory role:\nthe paradigmatic example is the prediction of the W and\nZ particles (experimentally found in 1983) in the context of\nthe Glashow-Weinberg-Salam gauge theory proposed in 1967 for the\nunification of the weak and electromagnetic interactions. These\nimpressive cases of the prediction of new phenomena might then be used\nto argue for an ontological status for symmetries, via an inference to\nthe best explanation.\n\nAnother reason for attributing symmetries to nature is the so-called\ngeometrical interpretation of spatiotemporal symmetries, according to\nwhich the spatiotemporal symmetries of physical laws are interpreted\nas symmetries of spacetime itself, the \u201cgeometrical\nstructure\u201d of the physical world. Moreover, this way of seeing\nsymmetries can be extended to non-external symmetries, by considering\nthem as properties of other kinds of spaces, usually known as\n\u201cinternal spaces\u201d. The question of exactly what a realist\nwould be committed to on such a view of internal spaces remains open,\nand an interesting topic for discussion.\n\nOne approach to investigating the limits of an ontological stance with\nrespect to symmetries would be to investigate their empirical or\nobservational status: can the symmetries in question be directly\nobserved? We first have to address what it means for a symmetry to be\nobservable, and indeed whether all symmetries have the same\nobservational status. Kosso (2000) arrives at the conclusion that\nthere are important differences in the empirical status of the\ndifferent kinds of symmetries. In particular, while global continuous\nsymmetries can be directly observed \u2014 via such experiments as\nthe Galilean ship experiment \u2014 a local continuous symmetry can\nhave only indirect empirical evidence.  Brading and Brown (2004)\nargue for a different interpretation of Kosso\u2019s\n examples,[20]\n but agree with Kosso\u2019s assessment that local symmetry\ntransformations cannot exhibit an analogue of the Galileo\u2019s Ship\nExperiment. Against this view, Greaves and Wallace (2014) and Teh\n(2016) have recently argued that when suitably understood, local\nsymmetries can indeed have direct empirical significance (their\nargument turns on the possibility of using asymptotically non-trivial\nlocal symmetries to construct Galileo\u2019s Ship scenarios for\ncertain systems). In particular, Teh (2016) argues that this\nphenomenon is responsible for the empirically significant symmetries\nof topological soliton solutions. In a similar spirit, Gomes (2021)\nargues that a certain class of gauge transformations are on a par with\nGalileo\u2019s Ship, under special conditions, and that those conditions\nimply a certain kind of holism in the sense that the state of the\nUniverse is not uniquely determined by the state of its isolated\nsubsystems. On the other hand, Friederich (2015) contends that on\none plausible axiomatization of the schema introduced by Greaves and\nWallace, it is possible to deduce that local symmetries do not have\ndirect empirical significance. This debate was recently expanded by\nRoberts (2022, 4.3) to include discrete symmetry transformations like\ntime reversal. Roberts argues that these symmetries have direct\nempirical significance, but at a\n\u201chigher-order\u201d level, that derives from the direct\nempirical significance of spacetime translations.\n\nThe direct observational status of the familiar global spacetime\nsymmetries leads us to an epistemological aspect of\nsymmetries. According to Wigner, the spatiotemporal invariance\nprinciples play the role of a prerequisite for the very possibility of\ndiscovering the laws of nature: \u201cif the correlations between\nevents changed from day to day, and would be different for different\npoints of space, it would be impossible to discover them\u201d\n(Wigner, 1967, p. 29). For Wigner, this conception of symmetry\nprinciples is essentially related to our ignorance (if we could\ndirectly know all the laws of nature, we would not need to use\nsymmetry principles in our search for them). Others, on the contrary,\nhave arrived at a view according to which symmetry principles function\nas \u201ctranscendental principles\u201d in the Kantian sense (see\nfor instance Mainzer, 1996). It should be noted in this regard that\nWigner\u2019s starting point, as quoted above, does not imply exact\nsymmetries \u2014 all that is needed epistemologically is that the\nglobal symmetries hold approximately, for suitable spatiotemporal\nregions, such that there is sufficient stability and regularity in the\nevents for the laws of nature to be discovered.\n\nThere is another reason why symmetries might be seen as being\nprimarily epistemological. As we have mentioned, there is a close\nconnection between the notions of symmetry and equivalence, and this\nleads also to a notion of irrelevance: the equivalence of space points\n(translational symmetry), for example, may be understood in the sense\nof the irrelevance of an absolute position to the physical\ndescription. There are two ways that one might interpret the\nepistemological significance of this: on the one hand, we might say\nthat symmetries are associated with unavoidable redundancy in our\ndescriptions of the world, while on the other hand we might\nmaintain that symmetries indicate a limitation of our epistemic access\n\u2014 there are certain properties of objects, such as their\nabsolute positions, that are not observable. The view that symmetries\nare connected with the presence of non-observable quantities in the\nphysical description, with the corollary that the empirical violation\nof a symmetry is intended in the sense that what was thought to be a\nnon-observable turns out to be actually an observable, was\nparticularly defended by one of the discover of parity violation, T.D.\nLee (see section 2.4). According to Lee (1981), \u201cthe root of all\nsymmetry principles lies in the assumption that it is impossible to\nobserve certain basic quantities\u201d (p. 178). See on this (and,\nmore generally, on the relation between symmetry, equivalence and\nirrelevance) Castellani (2003). Dasgupta (2016) defends an epistemic\ninterpretation of symmetry on a similar basis as Lee, that he calls\nthe \u201csymmetry to reality inference\u201d. In contrast,\nRoberts (2022, 4.4) argues that the symmetry to reality inference is\nnot generally valid.\n\nFinally, we would like to mention an aspect of symmetry that might\nvery naturally be used to support either an ontological or an\nepistemological account. It is widely agreed that there is a close\nconnection between symmetry and objectivity, the starting\npoint once again being provided by spacetime symmetries: the laws by\nmeans of which we describe the evolution of physical systems have an\nobjective validity because they are the same for all observers. The\nold and natural idea that what is objective should not depend upon the\nparticular perspective under which it is taken into consideration is\nthus reformulated in the following group-theoretical terms: what is\nobjective is what is invariant with respect to the transformation\ngroup of reference frames, or, quoting Hermann Weyl (1952, p. 132),\n\u201cobjectivity means invariance with respect to the group of\nautomorphisms [of\n space-time]\u201d.[21]\n Debs and Redhead (2007) label as \u201cinvariantism\u201d the view\nthat \u201cinvariance under a specified group of automorphisms is\nboth a necessary and sufficient condition for objectivity\u201d (p.\n60). They point out (p. 73, and see also p. 66) that there is a\nnatural connection between \u201cinvariantism\u201d and structural\nrealism.\n\nGrowing interest, recently, in the metaphysics of physics includes\ninterest in symmetries. Baker (2010) offers an accessible\nintroduction, and Livanios (2010), connecting discussions of\nsymmetries to dispositions and essences, is an example of this\nwork.\n\nTo conclude: symmetries in physics offer many interpretational\npossibilities, and how to understand the status and significance of\nphysical symmetries clearly presents a challenge to both physicists\nand philosophers. A recent, comprehensive survey of the\nphilosophy of symmetry is Teh forthcoming.\n",
