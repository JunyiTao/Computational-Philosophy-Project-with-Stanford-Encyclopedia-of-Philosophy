    "main_text": "Semantic Theories || Alternatives to Classical Semantic Theories\n2.2 Alternatives to Classical Semantic Theories\n\nClassical semantic theories, however, are not the only game in town.\nThis section lays out the basics of five alternatives to classical semantic\ntheorizing.\n2.2.1 Davidsonian semantics\n\nOne kind of challenge to classical semantics attacks the idea that the\njob of a semantic theory is to systematically pair expressions with\nthe entities which are their meanings. Wittgenstein was parodying just\nthis idea when he wrote \n\n\nYou say: the point isn\u2019t the word, but its meaning, and you\nthink of the meaning as a thing of the same kind as the word, though\nalso different from the word. Here the word, there the meaning. The\nmoney, and the cow that you can buy with it. (Wittgenstein 1953,\n\u00a7120)\n\n\nWhile Wittgenstein himself did not think that systematic theorizing\nabout semantics was possible, this anti-theoretical stance has not\nbeen shared by all subsequent philosophers who share his aversion to\n\u201cmeanings as entities\u201d. A case in point is Donald\nDavidson. Davidson thought that semantic theory should take the form\nof a theory of truth for the language of the sort which Alfred Tarski\nshowed us how to construct (see Tarski 1944 and entry on\n Tarski\u2019s truth definitions).\n\nFor our purposes, it will be convenient to think of a Tarskian truth\ntheory as a variant on the sorts of theories of reference introduced\nin\n \u00a72.1.1.\n Recall that theories of reference of this sort specified, for each\nproper name in the language, the object to which that name refers, and\nfor every simple predicate in the language, the set of things which\nsatisfy that predicate. If we then consider a sentence which combines\na proper name with such a predicate, like\n\n\nAmelia sings\n\n\nthe theory tells us what it would take for that sentence to be true:\nit tells us that this sentence is true if and only if the object to\nwhich \u201cAmelia\u201d refers is a member of the set of things\nwhich satisfy the predicate \u201csings\u201d\u2014i.e., the set of\nthings which sing. So we can think of a full theory of reference for\nthe language as implying, for each sentence of this sort, a\nT-sentence of the form\n\n\n\u201cAmelia sings\u201d is T (in the language) if and only\nif Amelia sings.\n\n\nSuppose now that we expand our theory of reference so that it implies\na T-sentence of this sort for every sentence of the language, rather\nthan just for simple sentences which result from combining a name and\na monadic predicate. We would then have a Tarskian truth theory for\nour language. Tarski\u2019s idea was that such a theory would define\na truth predicate (\u201cT\u201d) for the language; Davidson,\nby contrast, thought that we find in Tarskian truth theories\n\u201cthe sophisticated and powerful foundation of a competent theory\nof meaning\u201d (Davidson 1967).\n\nThis claim is puzzling: why should a a theory which issues\nT-sentences, but makes no explicit claims about meaning or content,\ncount as a semantic theory? Davidson\u2019s answer was that\nknowledge of such a theory would be sufficient to understand the\nlanguage. If Davidson were right about this, then he would have a\nplausible argument that a semantic theory could take this form. After\nall, it is plausible that someone who understands a language knows the\nmeanings of the expressions in the language; so, if knowledge of a\nTarskian truth theory for the language were sufficient to understand\nthe language, then knowledge of what that theory says would be\nsufficient to know all the facts about the meanings of expressions in\nthe language, in which case it seems that the theory would state all\nthe facts about the meanings of expressions in the language.\n\nOne advantage of this sort of approach to semantics is its parsimony:\nit makes no use of the intensions, Russellian propositions, or Fregean\nsenses assigned to expressions by the propositional semantic theories\ndiscussed above. Of course, as we saw above, these entities were\nintroduced to provide a satisfactory semantic treatment of various\nsorts of linguistic constructions, and one might well wonder whether\nit is possible to provide a Tarskian truth theory of the sort sketched\nabove for a natural language without making use of intensions,\nRussellian propositions, or Fregean senses. The Davidsonian program\nobviously requires that we be able to do this, but it is still very\nmuch a matter of controversy whether a truth theory of this sort can\nbe constructed. Discussion of this point is beyond the scope of this\nentry; one good way into this debate is through the debate about\nwhether the Davidsonian program can provide an adequate treatment of\npropositional attitude ascriptions. See the discussion of the\nparatactic account and interpreted logical forms in the entry on\n propositional attitude reports.\n (For Davidson\u2019s initial treatment of attitude ascriptions, see\nDavidson 1968; for further discussion see, among other places, Burge\n1986; Schiffer 1987; Lepore and Loewer 1989; Larson and Ludlow 1993;\nSoames 2002.)\n\nLet\u2019s set this aside, and assume that a Tarskian truth theory of\nthe relevant sort can be constructed, and ask whether, given this\nsupposition, this sort of theory would provide an adequate semantics.\nThere are two fundamental reasons for thinking that it would not, both\nof which are ultimately due to Foster (1976). Larson and\nSegal (1995) call these the extension problem and the\ninformation problem.\n\nThe extension problem stems from the fact that it is not enough for a\nsemantic theory whose theorems are T-sentences to yield true theorems;\nthe T-sentence\n\n\n\u201cSnow is white\u201d is T in English iff grass is\ngreen.\n\n\nis true, but tells us hardly anything about the meaning of \u201cSnow\nis white\u201d. Rather, we want a semantic theory to entail, for each\nsentence of the object language, exactly one interpretive\nT-sentence: a T-sentence such that the sentence used on its right-hand\nside gives the meaning of the sentence mentioned on its left-hand\nside. Our theory must entail at least one such T-sentence for\neach sentence in the object language because the aim is to give the\nmeaning of each sentence in the language; and it must entail no\nmore than one because, if the theory had as theorems more than\none T-sentence for a single sentence S of the object language,\nan agent who knew all the theorems of the theory would not yet\nunderstand S, since such an agent would not know which of the\nT-sentences which mention S was interpretive.\n\nThe problem is that it seems that any theory which implies at least\none T-sentence for every sentence of the language will also imply more\nthan one T-sentence for every sentence in the language. For any\nsentences p, q, if the theory entails a T-sentence\n\n\nS is T in L iff p,\n\n\nthen, since p is logically equivalent to \\(p \\amp \\nsim(q \\amp\n\\nsim q)\\), the theory will also entail the T-sentence\n\n\nS is T in L iff \\(p \\amp \\nsim(q \\amp \\nsim\nq)\\),\n\n\nwhich, if the first is interpretive, won\u2019t be. But then the\ntheory will entail at least one non-interpretive T-sentence, and\nsomeone who knows the theory will not know which of the relevant\nsentences is interpretive and which not; such a person therefore would\nnot understand the language.\n\nThe information problem is that, even if our semantic theory entails\nall and only interpretive T-sentences, it is not the case that\nknowledge of what is said by these theorems would suffice for\nunderstanding the object language. For, it seems, I can know what is\nsaid by a series of interpretive T-sentences without knowing that they\nare interpretive. I may, for example, know what is said by the\ninterpretive T-sentence\n\n\n\u201cLondres est jolie\u201d is T in French iff London is\npretty\n\n\nbut still not know the meaning of the sentence mentioned on the\nleft-hand side of the T-sentence. The truth of what is said by this\nsentence, after all, is compatible with the sentence used on the\nright-hand side being materially equivalent to, but different in\nmeaning from, the sentence mentioned on the left. This seems to\nindicate that knowing what is said by a truth theory of the relevant\nkind is not, after all, sufficient for understanding a language. (For\nreplies to these criticisms, see Davidson (1976), Larson and Segal\n(1995) and K\u00f6lbel (2001); for criticism of these replies, see\nSoames (1992) and Ray (2014). For a reply to the latter, see\nKirk-Giannini and Lepore (2017).)\n2.2.2 Internalist semantics\n\nThe Davidsonian, on one reading, diagnoses the mistake of classical\nsemantics in its commitment to a layer of content which goes beyond a\ntheory of reference. A different alternative to classical semantics\ndeparts even more radically from that tradition, by denying that\nmind-world reference relations should play any role in semantic\ntheorizing.\n\nThis view is sometimes called \u201cinternalist semantics\u201d by\ncontrast with views which locate the semantic properties of\nexpressions in their relation to elements of the external world. This\ninternalist approach to semantics is associated with the work of Noam\nChomsky (see especially Chomsky 2000).\n\nIt is easy to say what this approach to semantics denies. The\ninternalist denies an assumption common to all of the approaches\ndiscussed so far: the assumption that in giving the content of an\nexpression, we are primarily specifying something about that\nexpression\u2019s relation to things in the world which that\nexpression might be used to say things about. According to the\ninternalist, expressions as such don\u2019t bear any semantically\ninteresting relations to things in the world; names don\u2019t, for\nexample, refer to the objects with which one might take them\nto be associated; predicates don\u2019t have extensions; sentences\ndon\u2019t have truth conditions. On this sort of view, we can use\nsentences to say true or false things about the world, and can use\nnames to refer to things; but this is just one thing we can do with\nnames and sentences, and is not a claim about the meanings of those\nexpressions.\n\nSo what are meanings, on this view? The most developed answer to this\nquestion is given in Pietroski (2018), according to which\n\u201cmeanings are instructions for how to build concepts of a\nspecial sort\u201d (2018: 36). By \u201cconcepts\u201d, Pietroski\nmeans mental representations of a certain kind. So the meaning of an\nexpression is an instruction to form a certain sort of mental\nrepresentation.\n\nOn this kind of view, while concepts may have extensions, expressions\nof natural languages do not. So this approach rejects not just the\ndetails but the foundation of the classical approach to semantics\ndescribed above.\n\nOne way to motivate an approach of this kind focuses on the ubiquity\nof the phenomenon of polysemy in natural languages. As Pietroski says,\n\n\n\nWe can use \u201cline\u201d to speak of Euclidean lines, fishing\nlines, telephone lines, waiting lines, lines in faces, lines of\nthought, etc. We can use \u201cdoor\u201d to access a concept of\ncertain impenetrable objects, or a concept of certain spaces that can\nbe occupied by such objects. (2018: 5) \n\n\nThe defender of the view that expressions have meanings which\ndetermine extensions seems forced to say that \u201cline\u201d and\n\u201cdoor\u201d are homophonous expressions, like\n\u201cbank\u201d. But that seems implausible; when one uses the\nexpressions \u201cfishing line\u201d and \u201cline of\nthought\u201d one seems to be using \u201cline\u201d in\nrecognizably the same sense. (This is a point of contrast with\nstandard examples of homophony, as when uses \u201cbank\u201d once\nto refer to a financial institution and then later to refer to the\nside of a river.) The internalist, by contrast, is not forced into\ntreating these as cases of homophony; he can say that the meaning of\n\u201cline\u201d is an instruction to fetch one of a family of\nconcepts.\n\nFor defenses and developments of internalist approaches to semantics,\nsee McGilvray (1998), Chomsky (2000), and Pietroski (2003, 2005,\n2018).\n2.2.3 Inferentialist semantics\n\nInternalist semantics can be understood as denying that classical\nsemantic assumption that a semantic theory should assign truth\nconditions to sentences. Another alternative to classical semantics\ndoes not deny that assumption, but does deny that truth conditions\nshould play the fundamental role in semantics that classical semantics\ngive to them.\n\nThis alternative is inferentialist semantics. The difference between\nclassical and inferentialist semantics is nicely put by Robert\nBrandom:\n\n\nThe standard way [of classical semantics] is to assume that one has a\nprior grip on the notion of truth, and use it to explain what good\ninference consists in. \u2026 [I]nferentialist pragmatism reverses\nthis order of explanation \u2026 It starts with a practical\ndistinction between good and bad inferences, understood as a\ndistinction between appropriate and inappropriate doings, and goes on\nto understand talk about truth as talk about what is preserved by the\ngood moves. (Brandom 2000: 12)\n\n\nThe classical semanticist begins with certain language-world\nrepresentational relations, and uses these to explain the truth\nconditions of sentences; we can then go on to use these truth\nconditions to explain the difference between good and bad inferences.\nThe inferentialist, by contrast, begins with the distinction between\ngood and bad inferences, and tries to explain the representational\nrelations which the classical semanticist takes as (comparatively)\nbasic in inferentialist terms. (I say \u201ccomparatively\nbasic\u201d because the classical semanticist might go on to provide\na reductive explanation of these representational relations, and the\ninferentialist might go on to provide a reductive explanation of the\ndistinction between good and bad inferences.\n\nAs Brandom also emphasizes, the divergence between the classical and\ninferentialist approaches to semantics arguably brings with it a\ndivergence on two other fundamental topics.\n\nThe first is the relative explanatory priority of the semantic\nproperties of sentences, on the one hand, and subsentential\nexpressions, on the other. It is natural for the classical semanticist\nto think that the representational relations between subsentential\nexpressions and their semantic contents can be explained independently\nof the representational properties of sentences (i.e., their truth\nconditions); the latter can thus be explained in terms of the former.\nFor the inferentialist, on the other hand, the semantic properties of\nsentences must come first, because inferential relations hold between\nsentences but not between subsentential expressions. (One cannot, for\nexample, infer one name from another.) So the inferentialist will not\nexplain the semantic properties of, for example, singular terms in\nterms of representational relations between those singular terms and\nitems in the world; rather, she will explain what is distinctive of\nsingular terms in terms of their role in certain kinds of inferences.\n(To see how this strategy might work, see Brandom 2000: Ch. 4.)\n\nThe second is the relative explanatory priority of the semantic\nproperties of individual sentences, on the one hand, and the semantic\nrelations between sentences on the other. The classical semanticist\ncan, so to speak, explain the meanings of sentences one by one; there\nis no difficulty in explaining the meaning of a sentence without\nmentioning other sentences. By contrast, according to the\ninferentialist,\n\n\nif the conceptual content expressed by each sentence or word is\nunderstood as essentially consisting in its inferential relations\n(broadly construed) or articulated by its inferential relations\n(narrowly construed), then one must grasp many such contents in order\nto grasp any. (Brandom 2000: 29)\n\n\nThis is sometimes called a holist approach to semantics. For\ndiscussions of the pros and cons of this kind of view, see the entry\non\n meaning holism.\n\nFor book length defenses of inferentialism, see Brandom (1994) and\nBrandom (2000). Important precursors include Wittgenstein (1953) and\nSellars (1968); see also the entries on\n Ludwig Wittgenstein\n and\n Wilfrid Sellars.\n For a classic objection to inferentialism, see Prior (1960). For a\ndiscussion of a prominent approach within the inferentialist\ntradition, see the entry on\n proof-theoretic semantics.\n2.2.4 Dynamic semantics\n\nIn laying out the various versions of classical semantics, we said a\nlot about sentences. By comparison, we said hardly anything about\nconversations, or discourses. This is no accident; classical\napproaches to semantics typically think of properties of conversations\nor discourses as explicable in terms of explanatorily prior semantic\nproperties of sentences (even if classical semanticists do often take\nthe semantic contents of sentences to be sensitive to features of the\ndiscourse in which they occur).\n\nDynamic semantics is, to a first approximation, an approach to\nsemantics which reverses these explanatory priorities. (The sorts of\nclassical theories sketched above are, by contrast, called\n\u201cstatic\u201d semantic theories.) On a dynamic approach, a\nsemantic theory does not aim primarily to deliver a pairing of\nsentences with propositions which then determine the sentence\u2019s\ntruth conditions. Rather, according to these dynamic approaches to\nsemantics, the semantic values of sentences are rather \u201ccontext\nchange potentials\u201d\u2014roughly, instructions for updating the\ncontext, or discourse.\n\nIn a dynamic context, many of the questions posed above about how best\nto understand the nature of semantic contents show up instead as\nquestions about how best to understand the nature of contexts and\ncontext change potentials. It is controversial not just whether a\ndynamic or static approach to semantics is likely to be more fruitful,\nbut also what exactly the distinction between dynamic and static\nsystems comes to. (For discussion of the latter question, see\nRothschild & Yalcin 2016.)\n\nThe relationship between dynamic semantics and classical semantics is\ndifferent than the relationship between the latter and the other\nalternatives to classical semantics that I\u2019ve discussed. The\nother alternatives to classical semantics reject some core feature of\nclassical semantics\u2014for example, the assignments of entities as\nmeanings, or the idea that meaning centrally involves word-world\nrelations. By contrast, dynamic semantics can be thought of as a kind\nof extension or generalization of classical semantics, which can\nemploy modified versions of much of the same theoretical\nmachinery.\n\nFoundational works in this tradition include Irene Heim\u2019s file\nchange semantics (1982)\nand Hans Kamp\u2019s\n discourse representation theory (see entry).\n For more details on different versions of this alternative to\nclassical semantics, see the entry on\n dynamic semantics.\n For critical discussion of the motivations for dynamic semantics, see\nKaren Lewis (2014). For discussion of the extent to which dynamic and\nstatic approaches are really in competition, see Stojni\u0107\n(2019).\n2.2.5 Expressivist semantics\n\nA final alternative to classical semantics differs from those\ndiscussed in the preceding four subsections in two (related)\nrespects.\n\nThe first is that, unlike the other non-classical approaches,\nexpressivist semantics was originally not motivated by linguistic\nconsiderations. Rather, it was developed in response to specifically\nmetaethical considerations. A number of philosophers held metaethical\nviews which made it hard for them to see how a classical semantic\ntreatment of sentences about ethics could be correct, and so developed\nexpressivism as an alternative treatment of these parts of\nlanguage.\n\nThis leads to a second difference between expressivist and our other\nfour alternatives to classical semantics. The latter are all\n\u201cglobal alternatives\u201d, in the sense that they propose\nnon-classical approaches to the semantics of all of a natural\nlanguage. By contrast, expressivists typically agree that classical\nsemantics (or one of the other non-expressivist alternatives to it\ndiscussed in\n \u00a7\u00a72.2.1\u20134)\n is correct for many parts of language; they just think that special\nfeatures of some parts of language require expressivist treatment.\n\nOne can think of many traditional versions of expressivism, which were\nmotivated by metaethical concerns, as involving two basic ideas.\nFirst, we can explain the meaning of a mental state by saying what\nmental state that sentence expresses. Second, the mental state\nexpressed by a sentence about ethics is different in kind from the\nmental state expressed by a \u201cfactual\u201d sentence.\n\nTwo follow up questions suggest themselves. One is about what\n\u201cexpresses\u201d means here; for one answer, see Gibbard\n(1990). A second is about what the relevant difference in mental\nstates consists in. On many views, the mental states expressed by\nnon-ethical sentences are beliefs, whereas the mental states expressed\nby ethical sentences are not. Different versions of expressivism\npropose different candidates for the mental states which are expressed\nby ethical sentences. Prominent candidates include exclamations (Ayer\n1936), commands (Hare 1952), and plans (Gibbard 1990, 2003).\n\nA classic problem for expressivist theories of the kind just sketched\ncomes from interactions between ethical and non-ethical bits of\nlanguage. This problem has come to be known as the Frege-Geach\nproblem, because a very influential version of the problem was posed\nby Geach (1960, 1965). (A version of the problem is also independently\npresented in Searle 1962.) In one of its versions, the problem comes\nin two parts. First, whatever mental state expressivists take ethical\nsentences to express will typically not be expressed by complex\nsentences which embed the relevant ethical sentence. So even if\n\n\nLying is wrong.\n\n\nexpresses the mental state of planning not to lie, the same sentence\nwhen embedded in the conditional\n\n\nIf lying is wrong, then what Jane did was wrong.\n\n\ndoes not. After all, one can endorse this conditional without\nendorsing a plan not to lie. So it seems that the expressivist must\nsay that \u201clying is wrong\u201d means something different when\nit occurs alone than it does when it occurs in the antecedent of a\nconditional. The problem, though, is that if one takes that view it is\nhard to see how it could follow from the above two sentences, as it\nsurely does, that\n\n\nWhat Jane did was wrong.\n\n\nFor a discussion of solutions to this problem, and an influential\ncritique of expressivism, see Schroeder (2008).\n\nMuch recent work on expressivism is both less focused on the special\ncase of ethics, and more motivated by purely linguistic\nconsiderations, than has often been the case traditionally. Examples\ninclude discussions of expressivism about epistemic modality in Yalcin\n(2007), about knowledge ascriptions in Moss (2013), and about\nvagueness in MacFarlane (2016).\n2.3 General Questions Facing Semantic Theories\n\nAs mentioned above, the aim of \u00a72 of this entry is to discuss\nissues about the form which a semantic theory should take which are at\na higher level of abstraction than issues about the correct semantic\ntreatment of particular expression-types. (Also as mentioned above,\nsome of these may be found in the entries on\n conditionals,\n descriptions,\n names,\n propositional attitude reports, and\n tense and aspect.)\n But there are some general issues in semantics which, while more\ngeneral than questions about how, for example, the semantics of\nadverbs should go, are largely (though not wholly) orthogonal to the\nquestion of which of the frameworks for semantic theorizing laid out\nin\n \u00a72.1\u20132\n should be adopted. The present subsection introduces a few of\nthese.\n2.3.1 How much context-sensitivity?\n\n\u00a72.1.4 introduced the idea that\nsome expressions might be context-sensitive, or indexical. Within a\npropositional semantics, we\u2019d say that these expressions have\ndifferent contents relative to distinct contexts; but the phenomenon\nof context-sensitivity is one which any semantic theory must\nrecognize. A very general question which is both highly important and\northogonal to the above distinctions between types of semantic\ntheories is: How much context-sensitivity is there in natural\nlanguages?\n\nVirtually everyone recognizes a sort of core group of indexicals,\nincluding \u201cI\u201d, \u201chere\u201d, and \u201cnow\u201d.\nMost also think of demonstratives, like (some uses of)\n\u201cthis\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d, as indexicals. But whether\nand how this list should be extended is a matter of controversy. Some\npopular candidates for inclusion are:\n\ndevices of quantification\ngradable adjectives\nalethic modals, including counterfactual conditionals\n\u201cknows\u201d and epistemic modals\npropositional attitude ascriptions\n\u201cgood\u201d and other moral terms\n\n\nMany philosophers and linguists think that one or more of these\ncategories of expressions are indexicals. Indeed, some think that\nvirtually every natural language expression is context-sensitive.\n\nQuestions about context-sensitivity are important, not just for\nsemantics, but for many areas of philosophy. And that is because some\nof the terms thought to be context-sensitive are terms which play a\ncentral role in describing the subject matter of other areas of\nphilosophy.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent example here is the role that the view that\n\u201cknows\u201d is an indexical has played in recent epistemology.\nThis view is often called \u201ccontextualism about knowledge\u201d;\nand in general, the view that some term F is an indexical is\noften called \u201ccontextualism about F\u201d. Contextualism\nabout knowledge is of interest in part because it promises to provide\na kind of middle ground between two opposing epistemological\npositions: the skeptical view that we know hardly anything about our\nsurroundings, and the dogmatist view that we can know that we are not\nin various Cartesian skeptical scenarios. (So, for example, the\ndogmatist holds that I can know that I am not a brain in a vat which\nis, for whatever reason, being made to have the series of experiences\nsubjectively indistinguishable from the experiences I actually have.)\nBoth of these positions can seem unappealing\u2014skepticism because\nit does seem that I can occasionally know, e.g., that I am sitting\ndown, and dogmatism because it\u2019s hard to see how I can rule out\nthe possibility that I am in a skeptical scenario subjectively\nindistinguishable from my actual situation.\n\nBut the disjunction of these positions can seem, not just unappealing,\nbut inevitable; for the proposition that I am sitting entails that I\nam not a brain in a vat, and it\u2019s hard to see\u2014presuming\nthat I know that this entailment holds\u2014how I could know the\nformer without thereby being in a position to know the latter. The\ncontextualist about \u201cknows\u201d aims to provide the answer:\nthe extension of \u201cknows\u201d depends on features of the\ncontext of utterance. Perhaps\u2014to take one among many possible\ncontextualist views\u2014a pair of a subject and a proposition\np will be in the extension of \u201cknows\u201d relative to a\ncontext only if that subject is able to rule out every possibility\nwhich is both (i) inconsistent with p and (ii) salient in\nC. The idea is that \u201cI know that I am sitting down\u201d\ncan be true in a normal setting, simply because the possibility that I\nam a brain in a vat is not normally salient; but typically \u201cI\nknow that I am not a brain in a vat\u201d will be false, since\ndiscussion of skeptical scenarios makes them salient, and (if the\nskeptical scenario is well-designed) I will lack the evidence needed\nto rule them out. See for discussion, among many other places, the\nentry on\n epistemic contextualism,\n Cohen (1986), DeRose (1992), and David Lewis (1996).\n\nHaving introduced one important contextualist thesis, let\u2019s\nreturn to the general question which faces the semantic theorist,\nwhich is: How do we tell when an expression is context-sensitive?\nContextualism about knowledge, after all, can hardly get off the\nground unless \u201cknows\u201d really is a context-sensitive\nexpression. \u201cI\u201d and \u201chere\u201d wear their\ncontext-sensitivity on their sleeves; but \u201cknows\u201d does\nnot. What sort of argument would suffice to show that an expression is\nan indexical?\n\nPhilosophers and linguists disagree about the right answers to this\nquestion. The difficulty of coming up with a suitable diagnostic is\nillustrated by considering one intuitively plausible test, defended in\nChapter 7 of Cappelen & Lepore (2005). This test says that an\nexpression is an indexical iff it characteristically blocks\ndisquotational reports of what a speaker said in cases in which the\noriginal speech and the disquotational report are uttered in contexts\nwhich differ with respect to the relevant contextual parameter. (Or,\nmore cautiously, that this test provides evidence that a given\nexpression is, or is not, context-sensitive.)\n\nThis test clearly counts obvious indexicals as such. Consider\n\u201cI\u201d. Suppose that Mary utters\n\n\nI am hungry.\n\n\nOne sort of disquotational report of Mary\u2019s speech would use the\nvery sentence Mary uttered in the complement of a \u201csays\u201d\nascription. So suppose that Sam attempts such a disquotational report\nof what Mary said, and utters\n\n\nMary said that I am hungry.\n\n\nThe report is obviously false; Mary said that Mary is hungry, not that\nSam is. The falsity of Sam\u2019s report suggests that \u201cI am\nhungry\u201d has a different content out of Mary\u2019s mouth than\nout of Sam\u2019s; and this, in turn, suggests that \u201cI\u201d\nhas a different content when uttered by Mary than when uttered by Sam.\nHence, it suggests that \u201cI\u201d is an indexical.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just that this test gives the right result in many\ncases; it\u2019s also that the test fits nicely with the plausible\nview that an utterance of a sentence of the form \u201cA said\nthat S\u201d in a context C is true iff the content of\nS in C is the same as the content of what the referent\nof \u201cA\u201d said (on the relevant occasion).\n\nThe interesting uses of this test are not uses which show that\n\u201cI\u201d is an indexical; we already knew that. The interesting\nuse of this test, as Cappelen and Lepore argue, is to show that many\nof the expressions which have been taken to be indexicals\u2014like\nthe ones on the list given above\u2014are not\ncontext-sensitive. For we can apparently employ disquotational reports\nof the relevant sort to report utterances using quantifiers, gradable\nadjectives, modals, \u201cknows\u201d, etc. This test thus\napparently shows that no expressions beyond the obvious\nones\u2014\u201cI\u201d, \u201chere\u201d, \u201cnow\u201d,\netc.\u2014are genuinely context-sensitive.\n\nBut, as Hawthorne (2006) argues, naive applications of this test seem\nto lead to unacceptable results. Terms for relative directions, like\n\u201cleft\u201d, seem to be almost as obviously context-sensitive\nas \u201cI\u201d; the direction picked out by simple uses of\n\u201cleft\u201d depends on the orientation of the speaker of the\ncontext. But we can typically use \u201cleft\u201d in disquotational\n\u201csays\u201d reports of the relevant sort. Suppose, for example,\nthat Mary says\n\n\nThe coffee machine is to the left.\n\n\nSam can later truly report Mary\u2019s speech by saying\n\n\nMary said that the coffee machine was to the left.\n\n\ndespite the fact that Sam\u2019s orientation in the context of the\nascription differs from Mary\u2019s orientation in the context of the\nreported utterance. Hence our test seems to lead to the absurd result\nthat \u201cleft\u201d is not context-sensitive.\n\nOne interpretation of this puzzling fact is that our test using\ndisquotational \u201csays\u201d ascriptions is a bit harder to apply\nthan one might have thought. For, to apply it, one needs to be sure\nthat the context of the ascription really does differ from the context\nof the original utterance in the value of the relevant contextual\nparameter. And in the case of disquotational reports using\n\u201cleft\u201d, one might think that examples like the above show\nthat the relevant contextual parameter is sometimes not the\norientation of the speaker, but rather the orientation of the subject\nof the ascription at the time of the relevant utterance.\n\nThis is but one criterion for context-sensitivity. But discussion of\nthis criterion brings out the fact that the reliability of an\napplication of a test for context-sensitivity will in general not be\nindependent of the space of views one might take about the contextual\nparameters to which a given expression is sensitive. For an\nilluminating discussion of ways in which we might revise tests for\ncontext-sensitivity using disquotational reports which are sensitive\nto the above data, see Cappelen & Hawthorne (2009). For a critical\nsurvey of other proposed tests for context-sensitivity, see Cappelen\n& Lepore (2005: Part I).\n\nThis is just an introduction to one central issue concerning the\nrelationship between context and semantic content. A sampling of other\ninfluential works on this topic includes Sperber and Wilson (1995),\nCarston (2002), Recanati (2004, 2010), Bezuidenhout (2002), and the\nessays in Stanley (2007).\n2.3.2 How many indices?\n\n\u00a72.1.5 introduced the idea of an\nexpression determining a reference, relative to a context, with\nrespect to a particular circumstance of evaluation. But that\ndiscussion left the notion of a circumstance of evaluation rather\nunderspecified. One might want to know more about what, exactly, these\ncircumstances of evaluation involve\u2014and hence about what sorts\nof things the reference of an expression can (once we\u2019ve fixed a\ncontext) vary with respect to.\n\nOne way to focus this question is to stay at the level of sentences,\nand imagine that we have fixed on a sentence S, with a certain\ncharacter, and context C. If sentences express propositions\nrelative to contexts, then S will express some proposition\nP relative to C. If the determination of reference in\ngeneral depends not just on character and context, but also on\ncircumstance, then we know that P might have different\ntruth-values relative to different circumstances of evaluation. Our\nquestion is: exactly what must we specify in order to determine\nP\u2019s truth-value?\n\nLet\u2019s say that an index is the sort of thing which, for\nsome proposition P, we must at least sometimes specify in order\nto determine P\u2019s truth-value. Given this usage, we can think of\ncircumstances of evaluation\u2014the things which play the\ntheoretical role outlined in\n \u00a72.1.5\u2014as\n made up of indices.\n\nThe most uncontroversial candidate for an index is a world, because\nmost advocates of a propositional semantics think that propositions\ncan have different truth-values with respect to different possible\nworlds. The main question is whether circumstances of evaluation need\ncontain any indices other than a possible world.\n\nThe most popular candidate for a second index is a time. The view that\npropositions can have different truth-values with respect to different\ntimes\u2014and hence that we need a time index\u2014is often called\n\u201ctemporalism\u201d. The negation of temporalism is\neternalism.\n\nThe motivations for temporalism are both metaphysical and semantic. On\nthe metaphysical side, A-theorists about time (see the entry on\n time)\n think that corresponding to predicates like \u201cis a child\u201d\nare A-series properties which a thing can have at one time, and lack\nat another time. (Hence, on this view, the property corresponding to\n\u201cis a child\u201d is not a property like being a child in\n2014, since that is a property which a thing has permanently if\nat all, and hence is a B-series rather than A-series property.) But\nthen it looks like the proposition expressed by \u201cViolet is a\nchild\u201d\u2014which predicates this A-series property of\nViolet\u2014should have different truth-values with respect to\ndifferent times. And this is enough to motivate the view that we\nshould have an index for a time.\n\nOn the semantic side, as Kaplan (1989) notes, friends of the idea that\ntenses are best modeled as operators have good reason to include a\ntime index in circumstances of evaluation. After all, operators\noperate on contents, so if there are temporal operators, they will\nonly be able to affect truth-values if those contents can have\ndifferent truth-values with respect to different times.\n\nA central challenge for the view that propositions can change\ntruth-value over time is whether the proponent of this view can make\nsense of retention of propositional attitudes over time. For suppose\nthat I believe in 2014 that Violet is a child. Intuitively, I might\nhold fixed all of my beliefs about Violet for the next 40 years,\nwithout its being true, in 2054, that I have the obviously false\nbelief that Violet is still a child. But the temporalist, who thinks\nof the proposition that Violet is a child as something which\nincorporates no reference to a time and changes truth-value over time,\nseems stuck with this result. Problems of this sort for temporalism\nare developed in Richard (1981); for a response see Sullivan\n(2014).\n\nMotivations for eternalism are also both metaphysical and semantic.\nThose attracted to B-theories of time will take propositions to have\ntheir truth-values eternally, which makes inclusion of a time index\nsuperfluous. And those who think that tenses are best modeled in terms\nof quantification over times rather than using tense operators will,\nsimilarly, see no use for a time index. For a defense of the\nquantificational over the operator analysis of tense, see King\n(2003).\n\nIs there a case to be made for including any indices other than a\nworld and a time? There is; and this has spurred much of the recent\ninterest in relativist semantic theories. Relativist semantic theories\nhold that our indices should include not just a world and (perhaps) a\ntime, but also a context of assessment. Just as propositions\ncan have different truth values with respect to different worlds, so,\non this view, they can vary in their truth depending upon features of\nthe conversational setting in which they are considered. (Though this\nway of putting things assumes that the relativist should be a\n\u201ctruth relativist\u201d rather than a \u201ccontent\nrelativist\u201d. See for discussion\nWeatherson and Egan 2011: \u00a7 2.3.)\n\nThe motivations for this sort of view can be illustrated by a type of\nexample whose importance is emphasized in Egan et al. (2005). Suppose\nthat, at the beginning of a murder investigation inquiry, I say\n\n\nThe murderer might have been on campus at midnight.\n\n\nIt looks like the proposition expressed by this sentence will be true,\nroughly, if we don\u2019t know anything which rules out the murderer\nhaving been on campus at midnight. But now suppose that more\ninformation comes in, some of which rules out the murderer having been\non campus at midnight. At this point, it seems, I could truly say\n\n\nWhat I said was false\u2014the murderer couldn\u2019t have been on\ncampus at midnight.\n\n\nBut this is puzzling. It is not puzzling that the sentence \u201cThe\nmurderer might have been on campus at midnight\u201d could be true\nwhen uttered in the first context but false when uttered in the second\ncontext; that fact could be accommodated by any number of\ncontextualist treatments of epistemic modals, which would dissolve the\npuzzle by saying that the sentence expresses different propositions\nrelative to the two contexts. The puzzle is that the truth of the\nsecond sentence seems to imply that the proposition expressed by the\nfirst\u2014which we agreed was true relative to that context\u2014is\nfalse relative to the second context. Here we don\u2019t have (or\ndon\u2019t just have) sentences varying in truth-value depending on\ncontext; we seem to have propositions varying in truth-value depending\non context. The relativist about epistemic modals takes appearance\nhere to be reality, and holds that, in addition to worlds (and maybe\ntimes), propositions can sometimes differ in their truth-value\nrelative to contexts of assessment (roughly, the context in which the\nproposition is being considered). (Note that it is not essential to\nthe case that the two contexts of assessment are at different times;\nmuch the same intuitions can be generated by considering cases of\n\u201ceavesdropping\u201d, in which one party overhears the\nutterance of some other group which lacks some of its evidence.)\n\nRelativist treatments of various expressions have also been motivated\nby certain apparent facts about disagreement. Lasersohn (2005)\nconsiders the example of predicates of personal taste. He points out\nthat we\u2019re often inclined to think that, if our tastes differ\nsufficiently, my utterance of \u201cThat soup is tasty\u201d can be\ntrue even while your utterance of \u201cThat soup is not tasty\u201d\nis also true. As above, this fact by itself is not especially\nsurprising, and might seem to cry out for a contextualist treatment of\n\u201ctasty\u201d. But the puzzling thing is that, despite the fact\nthat we think that each of us are uttering sentences which express\ntrue propositions, we are clearly disagreeing with each other. (You\nmight say, after overhearing me, \u201cNo, that soup is not\ntasty\u201d.)\n\nThe contrast here with indexicals is apparently quite sharp. If I say\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry\u201d, and you\u2019re not hungry,\nyou\u2019d never reply to my utterance by saying \u201cNo, I\u2019m\nnot hungry\u201d\u2014precisely because it\u2019s obvious that we\nwould not be disagreeing. So again we have a puzzle: a puzzle about\nhow each of our \u201csoup\u201d sentences could express true\npropositions, despite those propositions contradicting each other.\nRelativism suggests an answer: these propositions are only true or\nfalse relative to individuals. The one I express is true relative to\nme, and its negation is true relative to you; they\u2019re\ncontradictory in the sense that it is impossible for both to be true\nrelative to the same individual (at the same time).\n\nIt\u2019s very controversial whether any of these relativist\narguments are convincing. For more discussion, see the discussion of\n\u201cnew relativism\u201d in the entry on\n relativism.\n For an explication of relativism and its application to various kinds\nof discourse, see MacFarlane (2014). For an extended critique of\nrelativism, see Cappelen & Hawthorne (2009).\n2.3.3 What are propositions, anyway?\n\nMost philosophers believe in propositions, and hence think that\nsemantics should be done according to one of the three broad\ncategories of propositionalist approaches sketched above: possible\nworlds semantics, Russellianism, or Fregeanism. But it is notable that\nof these three views, only one\u2014possible worlds\nsemantics\u2014actually tells us what propositions are. (Even in that\ncase, of course, one might ask what possible worlds are, and hence\nwhat propositions are sets of. See the entry on\n possible worlds.)\n Russellian and Fregean views make claims about what sorts of things\nare the constituents of propositions\u2014but don\u2019t tell us\nwhat the structured propositions so constituted are.\n\nThere are really two questions here. One is the question: what does it\nmean to say that x is a constituent of a proposition? The\nlanguage of constituency suggests parthood; but there\u2019s some\nreason to think that x\u2019s being a constituent of a\nproposition isn\u2019t a matter of x\u2019s being a part of\nthat proposition. This is perhaps clearest on a Russellian view,\naccording to which ordinary physical objects can be constituents of\npropositions. The problem is that a thing can be a constituent of a\nproposition without every part of that thing being a constituent of\nthat proposition; a proposition with me as a constituent, it seems,\nneed not also have every single molecule that now composes me as a\nconstituent. But that fact is inconsistent with the idea that\nconstituency is parthood and the plausible assumption that parthood is\ntransitive. For discussion of this and other problems, see Gilmore\n(2014), Keller (2013), and Merricks (2015).\n\nHence the proponent of structured propositions owes some account of\nwhat \u201cstructure\u201d and \u201cconstituent\u201d talk\namounts to in this domain. And they can hardly take these notions as\nprimitive, since it would then be very unclear what explanatory value\nthe claim that propositions are structured could have.\n\nThe second, in some ways more fundamental, question, is: What sort of\nthing are propositions? To what metaphysical category do they belong?\nThe simplest and most straightforward answer to this question is:\n\u201cThey belong to the sui generis category of\npropositions\u201d. (This is the view of Plantinga (1974) and Merricks (2015).)\n\nBut recently many philosophers have sought to give different answers\nto this question, by trying to explain how propositions could be\nmembers of some other ontological category in which we have\nindependent reason to believe. Recent work of this sort can be divided\ninto three main families of views.\n\nAccording to the first, propositions are a kind of fact. This view\nwas, on some interpretations, advocated by Russell (1903) and\nWittgenstein (1922). The most prominent current defender of this view\nis Jeffrey King. On his version of the view, propositions (at least\nthe propositions expressed by sentences) are meta-linguistic facts\nabout sentences. At a first pass, and ignoring some important\nsubtleties, the proposition expressed by the sentence \u201cAmelia\ntalks\u201d will be the fact that there is some language L,\nsome expression x, some expression y, and some syntactic\nrelation R such that R(x,y), x has\nAmelia as its semantic value, y has the property of talking as\nits semantic value, and R encodes ascription. In some respects,\nthis view is not so far from\u2014though much more thoroughly\ndeveloped than\u2014Wittgenstein\u2019s view in the\nTractatus that \u201ca proposition is a propositional sign\nin its projective relation to the world\u201d (3.12). See for\ndevelopment and defense of this view King (2007, 2014).\n\nAccording to the second sort of view, propositions are kind of\nproperty. Versions of this view vary both according to which\nproperties they take propositions to be, and what they take\npropositions to be properties of. This view is most closely associated\nwith David Lewis (1979) and Chisholm (1981), who took the objects of\npropositional attitudes to be properties which the bearer of the\nattitude ascribes to him- or herself. Other versions of the view are\ndefended by van Inwagen (2004) and Gilmore (forthcoming), who take\npropositions to be 0-place relations, and Richard (2013) and Speaks\n(2014), who take propositions to be monadic properties of certain\nsorts.\n\nAccording to the third sort of view, propositions are entities which\nare, or owe their existence to, the mental acts of subjects. While\ntheir views differ in many ways, both Hanks (2007, 2011) and Soames\n(2010, 2014) think of propositions as acts of predication. In the\nsimplest case\u2014a monadic predication\u2014the proposition will\nbe the act of predicating a property of an object.\n\nOf course, not all views fit into these three categories. An important\nview which fits into none of them is defended in Moltmann (2013).\n\nDifferent theorists differ, not just in their views about what\npropositions are, but also in their views about what a theory of\npropositions should explain. The representational properties of\npropositions are a case in point. Hanks, King, and Soames take one of\nthe primary tasks of a theory of propositions to be the explanation of\nthe representational properties of propositions. Others, like McGlone\n(2012) and Merricks (2015), hold that a proposition\u2019s having\ncertain representational properties is a primitive matter. Still\nothers, like Richard and Speaks, deny that propositions have\nrepresentational properties in any interesting sense. See for further\ndiscussion of these issues the entry on\n structured propositions.\n3. Foundational Theories of Meaning\n\nWe now turn to our second sort of \u201ctheory of meaning\u201d:\nfoundational theories of meaning, which are attempts to specify the\nfacts in virtue of which expressions of natural languages come to have\nthe semantic properties that they have.\n\nThe question which foundational theories of meaning try to answer is a\ncommon sort of question in philosophy. In the philosophy of\n action (see entry)\n we ask what the facts are in virtue of which a given piece of\nbehavior is an intentional action; in questions about\n personal identity (see entry)\n we ask what the facts are in virtue of which x and y\nare the same person; in ethics we ask what the facts are in virtue of\nwhich a given action is morally right or wrong. But, even if they are\ncommon enough, it is not obvious what the constraints are on answers\nto these sorts of questions, or when we should expect questions of\nthis sort to have interesting answers.\n\nAccordingly, one sort of approach to foundational theories of meaning\nis simply to deny that there is any true foundational theory of\nmeaning. One might be quite willing to endorse one of the semantic\ntheories outlined above while also holding that facts about the\nmeanings of expressions are primitive, in the sense that there is no\nsystematic story to be told about the facts in virtue of which\nexpressions have the meanings that they have. (See, for example,\nJohnston 1988.)\n\nThere is another reason why one might be pessimistic about the\nprospects of foundational theories of meaning. While plainly distinct\nfrom semantics, the attempt to provide foundational theories is\nclearly in one sense answerable to semantic theorizing, since without\na clear view of the facts about the semantic contents of expressions\nwe won't have a clear view of the facts for which we are trying to\nprovide an explanation. One might, then, be skeptical about the\nprospects of foundational theories of meaning not because of a general\nprimitivist view of semantic facts, but just because one holds that\nnatural language semantics is not yet advanced enough for us to have a\nclear grip on the semantic facts which foundational theories of\nmeaning aim to analyze. (See for discussion Yalcin (2014).)\n\nMany philosophers have, however, attempted to provide foundational\ntheories of meaning. This section sets aside pessimism about\nthe prospects for such theories and lays out the main attempts to give\na systematic account of the facts about language users in virtue of\nwhich their words have the semantic properties that they do. It is\nuseful to separate these theories into two camps.\n\nAccording to the first sort of view, linguistic expressions inherit\ntheir contents from some other sort of bearer of content. So, for\nexample, one might say that linguistic expressions inherit their\ncontents from the contents of certain mental states with which they\nare associated. I\u2019ll call views of this type mentalist\ntheories. Mentalist theories are discussed in\n \u00a73.1,\n and non-mentalist theories in\n \u00a73.2.\n3.1 Mentalist Theories\n\nAll mentalist theories of meaning have in common that they analyze one\nsort of representation\u2014linguistic representation\u2014in terms\nof another sort of representation\u2014mental representation. For\nphilosophers who are interested in explaining content, or\nrepresentation, in non-representational terms, then, mentalist\ntheories can only be a first step in the task of giving an ultimate\nexplanation of the foundations of linguistic representation. The\nsecond, and more fundamental explanation would then come at the level\nof a theory of mental content. (For an overview of theories of this\nsort, see entry on\n mental representation\n and the essays in Stich and Warfield 1994.) Indeed, the popularity of\nmentalist theories of linguistic meaning, along with the conviction\nthat content should be explicable in non-representational terms, is an\nimportant reason why so much attention has been focused on theories of\nmental representation over the last few decades.\n\nSince mentalists aim to explain the nature of meaning in terms of the\nmental states of language users, mentalist theories may be divided\naccording to which mental states they take to be relevant to the\ndetermination of meaning. The most well-worked out views on this topic\nare the Gricean view, which explains meaning in terms of the\ncommunicative intentions of language users, and the view that the\nmeanings of expressions are fixed by conventions which pair sentences\nwith certain beliefs. We will discuss these in turn, followed by a\nbrief discussion of a third alternative available to the\nmentalist.\n3.1.1 The Gricean program\n\nPaul Grice\n developed an analysis of meaning which can be thought of as the\nconjunction of two claims: (1) facts about what expressions mean are\nto be explained, or analyzed, in terms of facts about what speakers\nmean by utterances of them, and (2) facts about what speakers mean by\ntheir utterances can be explained in terms of their intentions. These\ntwo theses comprise the \u201cGricean program\u201d for reducing\nmeaning to the contents of the intentions of speakers.\n\nTo understand Grice\u2019s view of meaning, it is important first to\nbe clear on the distinction between the meaning, or content, of\nlinguistic expressions\u2014which is what semantic theories\nlike those discussed in\n \u00a72\n aim to describe\u2014and what speakers mean by utterances\nemploying those expressions. This distinction can be illustrated by\nexample. (See entry on\n pragmatics\n for more discussion.) Suppose that in response to a question about\nthe weather in the city where I live, I say \u201cWell, South Bend is\nnot exactly Hawaii\u201d. The meaning of this sentence is fairly\nclear: it expresses the (true) proposition that South Bend, Indiana is\nnot identical to Hawaii. But what I mean by uttering this\nsentence is something more than this triviality: I mean by the\nutterance that the weather in South Bend is not nearly as good as that\nin Hawaii. And this example utterance is in an important respect very\ntypical: usually the propositions which speakers mean to convey by\ntheir utterances include propositions other than the one expressed by\nthe sentence used in the context. When we ask \u201cWhat did you mean\nby that?\u201d we are usually not asking for the meaning of the\nsentence uttered.\n\nThe idea behind stage (1) of Grice\u2019s theory of meaning is that\nof these two phenomena, speaker-meaning is the more fundamental:\nsentences and other expressions mean what they do because of what\nspeakers mean by their utterances of those sentences. (For more\ndetails about how Grice thought that sentence-meaning could be\nexplained in terms of speaker-meaning, see the discussion of resultant\nprocedures in the entry on\n Paul Grice.)\n One powerful way to substantiate the claim that speaker-meaning is\nexplanatorily prior to expression-meaning would be to show that facts\nabout speaker-meaning may be given an analysis which makes no use of\nfacts about what expressions mean; and this is just what stage (2) of\nGrice\u2019s analysis, to which we now turn, aims to provide.\n\nGrice thought that speaker-meaning could be analyzed in terms of the\ncommunicative intentions of speakers\u2014in particular, their\nintentions to cause beliefs in their audience.\n\nThe simplest version of this idea would hold that meaning p by\nan utterance is just a matter of intending that one\u2019s audience\ncome to believe p. But this can\u2019t be quite right. Suppose\nI turn to you and say, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot\u201d.\nI intend that you hear the words I am saying; so I intend that you\nbelieve that I have said, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my\nfoot\u201d. But I do not mean by my utterance that I have said,\n\u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot\u201d. That is my\nutterance\u2014what I mean by it is the proposition that you are\nstanding on my foot, or that you should get off of my foot. I do not\nmean by my utterance that I am uttering a certain sentence.\n\nThis sort of example indicates that speaker meaning can\u2019t just\nbe a matter of intending to cause a certain belief\u2014it must be\nintending to cause a certain belief in a certain way. But what, in\naddition to intending to cause the belief, is required for meaning\nthat p? Grice\u2019s idea was that one must not only intend to\ncause the audience to form a belief, but also intend that they do so\non the basis of their recognition of the speaker\u2019s intention.\nThis condition is not met in the above example: I don\u2019t expect\nyou to believe that I have uttered a certain sentence on the basis of\nyour recognition of my intention that you do so; after all,\nyou\u2019d believe this whether or not I wanted you to. This is all\nto the good.\n\nThis Gricean analysis of speaker-meaning can be formulated as\n follows:[5]\n\n[G] a means\np by uttering x iff a intends in uttering\nx that\n  1.\nhis audience come to\nbelieve p, \n  2.\n his audience recognize\nthis intention, and \n  3.\n (1) occur on the basis\nof (2). \n\n\nHowever, even if [G] can be given a fairly plausible motivation, and\nfits many cases rather well, it is also open to some convincing\ncounterexamples. Three such types of cases are: (i) cases in which the\nspeaker means p by an utterance despite knowing that the\naudience already believes p, as in cases of reminding or\nconfession; (ii) cases in which a speaker means p by an\nutterance, such as the conclusion of an argument, which the speaker\nintends an audience to believe on the basis of evidence rather than\nrecognition of speaker intention; and (iii) cases in which there is no\nintended audience at all, as in uses of language in thought. These\ncases call into question whether there is any connection between\nspeaker-meaning and intended effects stable enough to ground an\nanalysis of the sort that Grice envisaged; it is still a matter of\nmuch controversy whether an explanation of speaker meaning descended\nfrom [G] can succeed.\n\nFor developments of the Gricean program, see\u2014in addition to the\nclassic essays in Grice (1989)\u2014Schiffer (1972), Neale (1992),\nand Davis (2002). For an extended criticism, see Schiffer (1987).\n3.1.2 Meaning, belief, and convention\n\nAn important alternative to the Gricean analysis, which shares the\nGricean\u2019s commitment to a mentalist analysis of meaning in terms\nof the contents of mental states, is the analysis of meaning in terms\nof the beliefs rather than the intentions of speakers.\n\nIt is intuitively plausible that such an analysis should be possible.\nAfter all, there clearly are regularities which connect utterances and\nthe beliefs of speakers; roughly, it seems that, for the most part,\nspeakers seriously utter a sentence which (in the context) means\np only if they also believe p. One might then, try to\nanalyze meaning directly in terms of the beliefs of language users, by\nsaying that what it is for a sentence S to express some\nproposition p is for it to be the case that, typically, members\nof the community would not utter S unless they believed\np. However, we can imagine a community in which there is some\naction which everyone would only perform were they to believe some\nproposition p, but which is such that no member of the\ncommunity knows that any other member of the community acts according\nto a rule of this sort. It is plausible that in such a community, the\naction-type in question would not express the proposition p, or\nindeed have any meaning at all.\n\nBecause of cases like this, it seems that regularities in meaning and\nbelief are not sufficient to ground an analysis of meaning. For this\nreason, many proponents of a mentalist analysis of meaning in terms of\nbelief have sought instead to analyze meaning in terms of\nconventions governing such regularities. Roughly, a\nregularity is a matter of convention when the regularity obtains\nbecause there is something akin to an agreement among a group of\npeople to keep the regularity in place. So, applied to our present\nexample, the idea would be (again roughly) that for a sentence\nS to express a proposition p in some group is for there\nto be something like an agreement in that group to maintain some sort\nof regularity between utterances of S and agents\u2019\nbelieving p. This seems to be what is lacking in the example\ndescribed in the previous paragraph.\n\nThere are different ways to make this rough idea precise (see the\nentry on\n convention).\n According to one important view, a sentence S expresses the\nproposition p if and only if the following three conditions are\nsatisfied: (1) speakers typically utter S only if they believe\np and typically come to believe p upon hearing S,\n(2) members of the community believe that (1) is true, and (3) the\nfact that members of the community believe that (1) is true, and\nbelieve that other members of the community believe that (1) is true,\ngives them a good reason to go on acting so as to make (1) true. (This\na simplified version of the theory defended in David Lewis 1975.)\n\nFor critical discussion of this sort of analysis of meaning, see Burge\n1975, Hawthorne 1990, Laurence 1996, and Schiffer 2006.\n3.1.3 Mental representation-based theories\n\nThe two sorts of mentalist theories sketched above both try to explain\nmeaning in terms of the relationship between linguistic expressions\nand propositional attitudes of users of the relevant language. But\nthis is not the only sort of theory available to a theorist who wants\nto analyze meaning in terms of broadly mental representation. A common\nview in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science is that the\npropositional attitudes of subjects are underwritten by an internal\nlanguage of thought, comprised of mental representations. (See entry\non\n the computational theory of mind.)\n One might try to explain linguistic meaning directly in terms of the\ncontents of mental representations, perhaps by thinking of language\nprocessing as pairing linguistic expressions with mental\nrepresentations; one could then think of the meaning of the relevant\nexpression for that individual as being inherited from the content of\nthe mental representation with which it is paired.\n\nWhile this view has, historically, not enjoyed as much attention as\nthe mentalist theories discussed in the preceding two subsections, it\nis a natural view for anyone who endorses the widely held thesis that\nsemantic competence is to be explained by some sort of internal\nrepresentation of the semantic facts. If we need to posit such\ninternal representations anyway, it is natural to think that the\nmeaning of an expression for an individual can be explained in terms\nof that individual's representation of its meaning. For discussion of\nthis sort of theory, see Laurence (1996).\n\nJust as proponents of Gricean and convention-based theories typically\nview their theories as only the first stage in an analysis of\nmeaning\u2014because they analyze meaning in terms of another sort of\nmental representation\u2014so proponents of mental\nrepresentation-based theories will typically seek to provide an\nindependent analysis of contents of mental representations. For an\noverview of attempts to provide the latter sort of theory, see the\nentry on\n mental representation\n and the essays in Stich and Warfield (1994).\n3.2 Non-Mentalist Theories\n\nAs noted above, not all foundational theories of meaning attempt to\nexplain meaning in terms of mental content. One might be inclined to\npursue a non-mentalist foundational theory of meaning for a number of\nreasons; for example, one might be skeptical about the mentalist\ntheories on offer; one might think that mental representation should\nbe analyzed in terms of linguistic representation, rather than the\nother way around; or one might think that representation should be\nanalyzable in non-representational terms, and doubt whether there is\nany true explanation of mental representation suitable to accompany a\nmentalist reduction of meaning to mental representation.\n\nTo give a non-mentalist foundational theory of meaning is to say which\naspects of the use of an expression determine\nmeaning\u2014and do so without taking that expression to simply\ninherit its content from some more fundamental bearer of content. In\nwhat follows I\u2019ll briefly discuss some of the aspects of the use\nof expressions which proponents of non-mentalist theories have taken\nto explain their meanings.\n3.2.1 Causal origin\n\nIn Naming and Necessity, Kripke suggested that the reference\nof a name could be explained in terms of the history of use of that\nname, rather than by descriptions associated with that name by its\nusers. In the standard case, Kripke thought, the right explanation of\nthe reference of a name could be divided into an explanation of the\nname\u2019s introduction as name for this or that\u2014an\nevent of \u201cbaptism\u201d\u2014and its successful\ntransmission from one speaker to another.\n\nOne approach to the theory of meaning is to extend Kripke\u2019s\nremarks in two ways: first, by suggesting that they might serve as an\naccount of meaning, as well as\n reference;[6]\n and second, by extending them to parts of speech other than names.\n(See, for discussion, Devitt 1981.) In this way, we might aim to\nexplain the meanings of expressions in terms of their causal\norigin.\n\nWhile causal theories don\u2019t take expressions to simply inherit\ntheir contents from mental states, it is plausible that they should\nstill give mental states an important role to play in explaining\nmeaning. For example, it is plausible that introducing a term involves\nintending that it stand for some object or property, and that\ntransmission of a term from one speaker to another involves the latter\nintending to use it in the same way as the former.\n\nThere are two standard problems for causal theories of this sort\n(whether they are elaborated in a mentalist or a non-mentalist way).\nThe first is the problem of extending the theory from the case of\nnames to to other sorts of vocabulary for which the theory seems less\nnatural. Examples which have seemed to many to be problematic are\nempty names and non-referring theoretical terms, logical vocabulary,\nand predicates which, because their content does not seem closely\nrelated to the properties represented in perceptual experience, are\nnot intuitively linked to any initial act of \u201cbaptism\u201d.\nThe second problem, which is sometimes called the \u201cqua\nproblem\u201d, is the problem of explaining which of the many causes\nof a term\u2019s introduction should determine its content. Suppose\nthat the term \u201cwater\u201d was introduced in the presence of a\nbody of H2O. What made it a term for this substance, rather\nthan for liquid in general, or colorless liquid, or colorless liquid\nin the region of the term's introduction? The proponent of a causal\ntheory owes some answer to this question; see for discussion Devitt\nand Sterelny (1987).\n\nFor a classic discussion of the prospects of causal theories, see\nEvans (1973). For a\nrecent theory which makes causal origin part but not all of the story,\nsee Dickie (2015).\n3.2.2 Truth-maximization and the principle of charity\n\nCausal theories aim to explain meaning in terms of the relations\nbetween expressions and the objects and properties they represent. A\nvery different sort of foundational theory of meaning which maintains\nthis emphasis on the relations between expressions and the world gives\na central role to a principle of charity which holds that\n(modulo some qualifications) the right assignment of meanings to the\nexpression of a subject\u2019s language is that assignment of\nmeanings which maximizes the truth of the subject\u2019s\nutterances.\n\nAn influential proponent of this sort of view was Donald Davidson, who\nstated the motivation for the view as follows:\n\n\nA central source of trouble is the way beliefs and meanings conspire\nto account for utterances. A speaker who holds a sentence to be true\non an occasion does so in part because of what he means, or would\nmean, by an utterance of that sentence, and in part because of what he\nbelieves. If all we have to go on is the fact of honest utterance, we\ncannot infer the belief without knowing the meaning, and have no\nchance of inferring the meaning without the belief. (Davidson 1974a:\n314; see also Davidson 1973)\n\n\nDavidson\u2019s idea was that attempts to state the facts in virtue\nof which expressions have a certain meaning for a subject face a kind\nof dilemma: if we had an independent account of what it is for an\nagent to have a belief with a certain content, we could ascend from\nthere to an account of what it is for a sentence to have a meaning; if\nwe had an independent account of what it is for a sentence to have a\nmeaning, we could ascend from there to an account of what it is for an\nagent to have a belief with a certain content; but in fact neither\nsort of independent account is available, because many assignments of\nbeliefs and meanings are consistent with the subject\u2019s\nlinguistic behavior. Davidson\u2019s solution to this dilemma is that\nwe must define belief and meaning together, in terms of an independent\nthird fact: the fact that the beliefs of an agent, and the meanings of\nher words, are whatever they must be in order to maximize the truth of\nher beliefs and utterances.\n\nBy tying meaning and belief to truth, this sort of foundational theory\nof meaning implies that it is impossible for anyone who speaks a\nmeaningful language to be radically mistaken about the nature of the\nworld; and this implies that certain levels of radical disagreement\nbetween a pair of speakers or communities will also be impossible\n(since the beliefs of each community must be, by and large, true).\nThis is a consequence of the view which Davidson embraced (see\nDavidson 1974b); but one might also reasonably think that radical\ndisagreement, as well as radical error, are possible, and hence that\nany theory, like Davidson\u2019s, which implies that they are\nimpossible must be mistaken.\n\nA different sort of worry about a theory of this sort is that the\nrequirement that we maximize the truth of the utterances of subjects\nhardly seems sufficient to determine the meanings of the expressions\nof their language. It seems plausible, offhand, that there will be\nmany different interpretations of a subject\u2019s language which\nwill be tied on the measure of truth-maximization; one way to see the\nforce of this sort of worry is to recall the point, familiar from our\ndiscussion of possible worlds semantics in\n \u00a72.1.5\n above, that a pair of sentences can be true in exactly the same\ncircumstances and yet differ in meaning. One worry is thus that a\ntheory of Davidson\u2019s sort will entail an implausible\nindeterminacy of meaning. For Davidson\u2019s fullest attempt to\nanswer this sort of worry, see Chapter 3 of Davidson (2005).\n3.2.3 Reference magnetism\n\nA different sort of theory emerges from a further objection to the\nsort of theory discussed in the previous section. This objection is\nbased on Hilary Putnam\u2019s (1980, 1981) model-theoretic argument.\nThis argument aimed to show that there are very many different\nassignments of reference to subsentential expressions of our language\nwhich make all of our utterances true. (For details on how the\nargument works, see the entry on\n Skolem\u2019s paradox,\n especially \u00a73.4.) Putnam\u2019s argument therefore leaves us\nwith a choice between two options: either we must accept that there\nare no facts of the matter about what any of our expressions refer to,\nor we must deny that is determined solely by a principle of\ntruth-maximization.\n\nMost philosophers take the second option. Doing so, however,\ndoesn\u2019t mean that something like the principle of charity\ncan\u2019t still be part of our foundational theory of meaning.\n\nDavid Lewis (1983, 1984) gave a version of this kind of response,\nwhich he credits to Merrill (1980), and which has since been quite\ninfluential. His idea was that the assignment of contents to\nexpressions of our language is fixed, not just by the constraint that\nthe right interpretation will maximize the truth of our utterances,\nbut by picking the interpretation which does best at jointly\nsatisfying the constraints of truth-maximization and the constraint\nthat the referents of our terms should, as much as possible, be\n\u201cthe ones that respect the objective joints in nature\u201d\n(1984: 227).\n\nSuch entities are often said to be more \u201celigible\u201d to be\nthe referents of expressions than others. An approach to the\nfoundations of meaning based on the twin principles of charity +\neligibility has some claim to being the most widely held view today.\nSee Sider (2011) for an influential extension of the Lewisian\nstrategy.\n\nLewis\u2019 solution to Putnam\u2019s problem comes with a\nnon-trivial metaphysical price tag: recognition of an objective graded\ndistinction between more and less natural properties. Some have found\nthe price too much to pay, and have sought other approaches to the\nfoundational theory of meaning. But even if we recognize in our\nmetaphysics a distinction between properties which are\n\u201cjoint-carving\u201d and those which are not, we might still\ndoubt whether this distinction can remedy the sorts of indeterminacy\nproblems which plague foundational theories based solely on the\nprinciple of charity. For doubts along these lines, see Hawthorne\n(2007).\n3.2.4 Regularities in use\n\nA different way to develop a non-mentalist foundational theory of\nmeaning focuses less on relations between subsentential expressions or\nsentences and bits of non-linguistic reality and more on the\nregularities which govern our use of language. Views of this sort have\nbeen defended by a number of authors; this section focuses on the\nversion of the view developed in Horwich (1998, 2005).\n\nHorwich\u2019s core idea is that our acceptance of sentences is\ngoverned by certain laws, and, in the case of non-ambiguous\nexpressions, there is a single \u201cacceptance regularity\u201d\nwhich explains all of our uses of the expression. The type of\nacceptance regularity which is relevant will vary depending on the\nsort of expression whose meaning is being explained. For example, our\nuse of a perceptual term like \u201cred\u201d might be best\nexplained by the following acceptance regularity:\n\n\nThe disposition to accept \u201cthat is red\u201d in response to the\nsort of visual experience normally provoked by a red surface.\n\n\nwhereas, in the case of a logical term like \u201cand\u201d, the\nacceptance regularity will involve dispositions to accept inferences\ninvolving pairs of sentences rather than dispositions to respond to\nparticular sorts of experiences:\n\n\nThe disposition to accept the two-way argument schema \u201cp,\nq // p and q\u201d.\n\n\nAs these examples illustrate, it is plausible that a strength of a\nview like Horwich\u2019s is its ability to handle expressions of\ndifferent categories.\n\nLike its competitors, Horwich\u2019s theory is also open to some\nobjections. One might worry that his use of the sentential attitude of\nacceptance entails a lapse into mentalism, if acceptance either just\nis, or is analyzed in terms of, beliefs. There is also a\nworry\u2014which affects other \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cconceptual\nrole\u201d or \u201cfunctional role\u201d theories of\nmeaning\u2014that Horwich\u2019s account implies the existence of\ndifferences in meaning which do not exist; it seems, for example, that\ntwo people\u2019s use of some term might be explained by distinct\nbasic acceptance regularities without their meaning different things\nby that term. Schiffer (2000) discusses the example of\n\u201cdog\u201d, and the differences between the basic acceptance\nregularities which govern the use of the term for the blind, the\nbiologically unsophisticated, and people acquainted only with certain\nsorts of\n dogs.[7]\n3.2.5 Social norms\n\nThis last concern about Horwich\u2019s theory stems from the fact\nthat the theory is, at its core, an individualist theory: it explains\nthe meaning of an expression for an individual in terms of properties\nof that individual\u2019s use of the term. A quite different sort of\nuse theory of meaning turns from the laws which explain an\nindividual\u2019s use of a word to the norms which, in a society,\ngovern the use of the relevant terms. Like the other views discussed\nhere, the view that meaning is a product of social norms of this sort\nhas a long history; it is particularly associated with the work of the\nlater Wittgenstein and his philosophical descendants. (See especially\nWittgenstein 1953.)\n\nAn important defender of this sort of view is Robert Brandom. On\nBrandom\u2019s view, a sentence\u2019s meaning is due to the\nconditions, in a given society, under which it is correct or\nappropriate to perform various speech acts involving the sentence. To\ndevelop a theory of this sort, one must do two things. First, one must\nshow how the meanings of expressions can be explained in terms of\nthese normative statuses\u2014in Brandom\u2019s (slightly\nnonstandard) terms, one must show how semantics can be explained in\nterms of pragmatics. Second, one must explain how these normative\nstatuses can be instituted by social practices.\n\nFor details, see Brandom (1994), in which the view is developed at\ngreat length; for a critical discussion of Brandom\u2019s attempt to\ncarry out the second task above, see Rosen (1997). For discussion of\nthe role (or lack thereof) of normativity in a foundational theory of\nmeaning, see Hattiangadi (2007), Gluer and Wilkforss (2009), and the\nentry on\n meaning normativity.",
