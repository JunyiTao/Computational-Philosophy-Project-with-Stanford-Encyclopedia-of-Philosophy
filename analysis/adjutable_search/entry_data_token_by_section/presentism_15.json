    "main_text": "Temporal Passage\n7. Temporal Passage\n\nNext, we turn to an objection to presentism that concerns the idea\nthat time really passes. The challenge, put simply: presentism\nisn\u2019t compatible with time\u2019s passage. This is a problem\nsince presentism is a view that requires that reality is\n\u201cdynamic\u201d and that there is a change in what exists over\ntime, which is usually described in terms of the passage of time. (For\nthe purpose of this entry, we ignore general arguments to the\nconclusion that time doesn\u2019t really pass and, instead, focus on\nspecific challenges to presentism.)\n\nWhy think that presentism isn\u2019t compatible with passage?\nTypically, the passage of time is expressed in the following terms:\nwhat\u2019s future approaches the present, becoming less future, and\nwhat\u2019s past recedes from the present, becoming more past. Prima\nfacie, there\u2019s a problem. What\u2019s apparently required for\nthe truth of this passage metaphor is inconsistent with the view that\nonly present things exist. There are no future things, so nothing can\napproach the present; nor are there past things, so nothing recedes\nfrom the present. To defend presentism, we have to suggest another way\nto interpret the claim that time really passes.\n\nOne way to reinterpret the claim is as follows: there\u2019s change\nin what exists over time. Put another way: what\u2019s present\nchanges. But it\u2019s unclear whether this solves the problem or\nshifts it down the road. What\u2019s required in order to account for\nthe claim that \u201cwhat\u2019s present changes\u201d? One might\nreasonably suppose that to assert that what\u2019s present changes,\nfrom one moment to the next, we require a difference in the character\nof successive moments (see Leininger 2015). But there are no such\nsuccessive moments, given presentism. There\u2019s only the present\nmoment and its contents.\n\nIn defense of presentism, we might insist that what exists\nnow is sufficient to account for the difference in character\nof successive present moments. Some of the strategies used in reply to\nthe truth-maker objection are useful here. Consider, e.g., ersatz\npresentists who posit abstract times that represent how things were,\nare, and will be, when a given time is present (when it\u2019s\n\u201ctrue\u201d) (see Markosian 2004; Bourne 2006; Crisp 2007).\nErsatz presentism has the resources to assert that things really\nchange (and so time really passes); there\u2019s a difference between\nthe character of successive moments, given the manifold of ersatz\ntimes. How things are at the present time is different from how things\nwere (represented by an abstract time). Indeed, it seems that any\nversion of presentism that posits presently existing entities to\naddress worries about cross-time relations, for instance, or as\nputative \u201contological grounds\u201d for truths about the past,\ncan use such entities to establish that there\u2019s a difference\nbetween successive moments without reifying any non-present\nthings.\n\nAt this point, however, a new question arises. So understood,\npresentism has the resources to ground time\u2019s passing at only\nthe present time. That is, everything required to establish that\nthings change from one moment to the next must be contained within a\nsingle moment, the present. But within such a version of presentism,\nwhat guarantees that things really change? Or, to\napproach the same point differently, what in the metaphysics\nguarantees that the present resources accurately reflect how\nthings were\u2014e.g., why think that the ersatz manifold\naccurately represents the past\u2014when there\u2019s no connection\nto the past? Why can\u2019t reality consist of a single\n\u201cfrozen\u201d slice of concrete time, along with the various\nersatz times? If reality is that way (what\u2019s concrete never\nchanges and we have nothing more than a frozen concrete instant\nagainst the backdrop of many ersatz times), then we still have no\ntemporal passage. What the presentist must do is find some way of\ninsisting that reality cannot be such; reality cannot include but a\nsingle concrete slice coupled to truth-makers for talk about the past\nand future, where those truthmakers cannot be said to\nguarantee that things really change (cf. the\ndiscussion of how truth-makers get the \u201cright results\u201d\nfrom\n \u00a76).\n",
