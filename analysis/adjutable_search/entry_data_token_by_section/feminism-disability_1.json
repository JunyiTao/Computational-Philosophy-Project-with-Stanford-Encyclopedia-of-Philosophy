    "main_text": "The Importance and Relevance of Feminist Philosophy\n2. The Importance and Relevance of Feminist Philosophy\n\n\nThe attitudes and aims that have informed and propelled feminist\nphilosophy have been consequential for the study of disability in\nphilosophy. Asking why women have been excluded from the philosophical\ntradition, feminist thinkers explicitly have intended to remedy\nphilosophy's prevailing indifference to the way the world is\nexperienced by women, including women with disabilities. (But see\nWendell 1989 and 1996 for concerns about feminist theory's disregard\nof women with disabilities. Despite this criticism, Wendell's remedy\nfor such neglect is propelled by feminist precepts.) In doing so, they\nhave made interventions that have altered the course of\nphilosophy.\n\n\nSome have argued, for example, that the universality to which\nphilosophical theories traditionally have aspired cannot embrace women\nwithout erasing them. Some have questioned whether such a\nstandard discerns, or instead disregards, important dimensions and\ntextures of women's lives. Some also have affirmed differences\namong different kinds of women that they take to be, if not essential,\nat least as philosophically significant as the differences between\nwomen and men. (See, for example, Spelman 1988, Fuss 1989 and Crenshaw\n1991, among many others, for discussions of these matters.)\n\n\nSuch divergence from standard philosophical views invites expanding\nphilosophical theorizing on various topics, including ways of knowing,\nkinds of being (especially the ontological implications of embodiment and\nthe relationship between body and mind), principles of conduct,\nintrinsically valuable human properties and ways of life,\nconceptualization of personal and social identity, and other\ntraditional philosophical topics, by attending to differences\noccasioned by or associated with disability. Further, biased\npretextual and other unjust treatment of women has been traced by some\nfeminist philosophers to their being viewed as impaired and thereby\nsubjected to the usual social practice of devaluing disability and\npeople who are disabled. Some of the initial philosophically\ninfluential discussions of disability have to do with how women's\nphysical realities are judged to be inferior because they do not match\nperformances paradigmatic of healthy males. One example is Iris Marion\nYoung's 1980 essay \u201cThrowing Like a Girl,\u201d about the\nprevailing masculinized rendering of women's embodiment that\nstigmatizes feminine physicality, wrongly construing the female body as\nfragile and burdensome. As a result, women are inhibited from\nconfidently embracing their own experienced spatial orientation and are\ninduced instead to underestimate their physical capabilities and to\ndeform their gestures and their movements through space. Another\nis Susan Wendell's 1989 Hypatia article \u201cToward a\nfeminist theory of disability,\u201d wherein feminist\nphilosophy's uncritical, unreflective conflation of healthiness\nwith happiness and productivity is criticized. \n\n\nIn a conceptual climate that affords men's modes of bodily\nperformance ascendancy, women are at heightened risk of being\nsegregated and disrespected in virtue of being deemed deficient in\nphysical or mental strength or health. Also consequential in the\ndevelopment of feminist philosophical treatments of disability has been\nthe high frequency of assignment of women (rather than men) to the\ncaretaking of individuals with disabilities, a social arrangement that\nusually burdens and frequently fails to recognize or materially reward\nthose who must occupy this role and therefore one that unfairly\ndisadvantages women. Considerations like these helped tie\nliberatory feminist philosophical work to the development of an\ninsightful philosophy of disability.\n\n\nPervading the practice of philosophy, feminists found, are traces of\nbias that disregards women's interests and oppressively occludes\ntheir opportunities. Illuminating the significance of women's\nexperiences of limitation is one of feminism's prominent contributions\nto philosophy. Early philosophical study of women by feminist\nscholars examined the limitations that hampered their own lives, and\nthe lives of women generally, asking whether these resulted from\nalterable social arrangement or immutable biological destiny.\n(See Section 2.2, \u201cNormative and Descriptive Components,\u201d\nof SEP entry on \u201cTopics in Feminism\u201d for references to\nscholars who advance variations of these positions on the source(s) of\nwomen's subordination.) On the whole (although not for\neverybody), feminist theory has moved past this issue and now seems to\nregard the debate about biology versus society as the source of\nwomen's limitation as either irresolvable or unimportant.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the nature of the (in)justice of limitations associated\nwith physical or cognitive impairment remains a concern in the\nphilosophy of disability, including feminist disability\ntheory. Biological difference is a central and undeniable fact of\ndisability, but the impact of biology on the kinds of experiences\ncharacteristic of being disabled is much more controversial.  There is\ndebate as to whether the functional limitations associated with\ndisability result mainly from biology's going awry and whether, if\ndisability is disadvantageous, it is naturally and immutably so. Or\ninstead whether disabled people's functional limitation should be laid\nat the door of flawed social practice which rewards the\nspecies-typical functioning of so-called normal people and punishes\nthe anomalous functioning of disabled people (Wendell 1996). \n",
