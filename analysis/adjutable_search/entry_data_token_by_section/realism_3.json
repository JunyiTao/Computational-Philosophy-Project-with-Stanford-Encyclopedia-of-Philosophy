    "main_text": "Reductionism and Non-Reductionism\n4. Reductionism and Non-Reductionism\n\nAlthough some commentators (e.g. Pettit 1991) require that a realistic\nview of a subject matter be non-reductionist about the distinctive\nobjects, properties, and facts of that subject matter, the\nreductionist/non-reductionist issue is really orthogonal to the\nvarious debates about realism. There are a number of reasons for this,\nwith the reasons varying depending on the type of reduction\nproposed.\n\nSuppose, first of all, that one wished to deny the existence claim\nwhich is a component of platonic realism about arithmetic. One way to\ndo this would be to propose an analytic reduction of talk\nseemingly involving abstract entities to talk concerning only concrete\nentities. This can be illustrated by considering a language the truth\nof whose sentences seemingly entails the existence of a type of\nabstract object, directions. Suppose there is a first order language\nL, containing a range of proper names \u2018a\u2019,\n\u2018b\u2019, \u2018c\u2019, and so on, where\nthese denote straight lines conceived as concrete inscriptions. There\nare also predicates and relations defined on straight lines, including\n\u2018 \u2026 is parallel to \u2026\u2019. \u2018D(\n)\u2019 is a singular term forming operator on lines, so that\ninserting the name of a concrete line, as in\n\u2018D(a)\u2019, produces a singular term\nstanding for an abstract object, the direction of a. A number\nof contextual definitions are now introduced:\n\n\u2018D(a) = D(b)\u2019 is\ntrue if and only if a is parallel to b.\n\u2018\u03a0D(x)\u2019 is true if and only if\n\u2018Fx\u2019 is true, where \u2018\u2026 is parallel\nto \u2026\u2019 is a congruence for \u2018F(\n)\u2019.\n\n(To say that \u2018\u2026 is parallel to \u2026\u2019 is a\ncongruence for \u2018F( )\u2019 is to say that if\na is parallel to b and Fa, then it follows\nthat Fb).\n\n\n\u2018(\u2203x)\u03a0x\u2019 is true if and\nonly if \u2018(\u2203x)Fx\u2019 is true, where\n\u2018\u03a0\u2019 and \u2018F\u2019 are as in (B).\n\n\nAccording to a platonic realist, directions exist and have a nature\nwhich is independent of anyone\u2019s beliefs, linguistic practices,\nconceptual schemes, and so on. But doesn\u2019t the availability of\n(A), (B), and (C) undermine the existence claim at the heart of\nplatonic realism? After all, (A), (B), and (C) allow us to paraphrase\nany sentence whose truth appears to entail the existence of abstract\nobjects into a sentence whose truth involves only the existence of\nconcrete inscriptions. Doesn\u2019t this show that an analytic\nreduction can aid someone wishing to question the existence claim\ninvolved in a particular form of realism? There is a powerful\nargument, first developed by William Alston (1958), and convincingly\nresuscitated by Crispin Wright (1983, Ch.1), that suggests not. The\nanalytic reductionist who wishes to wield the contextual definitions\nagainst the existence claim at the heart of platonic realism takes\nthem to show that the apparent reference to abstract objects on the\nleft-hand sides of the definitions is merely apparent: in\nfact, the truth of the relevant sentences entails only the existence\nof a range of concrete inscriptions. But the platonic realist can\nretort: what the contextual definitions show is that the apparent\nlack of reference to abstract objects on the\nright-hand sides is merely apparent. In fact, the platonic\nrealist can say, the truth of the sentences figuring on the right-hand\nsides implicitly involves reference to abstract objects. If there is\nno way to break this deadlock the existence of the analytic reductive\nparaphrases will leave the existence claim at the heart of the\nrelevant form of realism untouched. So the issue of this style of\nreductionism appears to be orthogonal to debates between realists and\nnon-realists.\n\nCan the same be said about non-analytic styles of reductionism? Again,\nthere is no straightforward connection between the issue of\nreductionism and the issue of realism. The problem is that, to borrow\nsome terminology and examples from Railton 1989, some reductions will\nbe vindicative whilst others will be eliminativist.\nFor example, the reduction of water to H20 is vindicative:\nit vindicates our belief that there is such a thing as water, rather\nthan overturning it. On the other hand:\n\n\u2026 the reduction of \u2018polywater\u2019\u2014a peculiar\nform of water thought to have been observed in laboratories in the\n1960s\u2014to\nordinary-water-containing-some-impurities-from-improperly-washed-glassware\ncontributed to the conclusion that there really is no such substance\nas polywater (1989: 161).\n\n\nThus, a non-analytic reduction may or may not have implications for\nthe existence dimension of a realistic view of a particular subject\nmatter. And even if the existence dimension is vindicated, there is\nstill the further question whether the objects and properties\nvindicated are independent of anyone\u2019s beliefs, linguistic\npractices, and so on. Again, there is no straightforward relationship\nbetween the issue of reductionism and the issue of realism.\n",
