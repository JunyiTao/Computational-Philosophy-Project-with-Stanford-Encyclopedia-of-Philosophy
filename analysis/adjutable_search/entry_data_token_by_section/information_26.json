The corresponding philosophical\nself-reflection in history neatly follows the technical developments\nfrom: Is the human mind an automaton, to is the mind a Turing machine\nand, eventually, is the mind a quantum computer? It is not the place\nhere to discuss these matters extensively, but the corresponding\nproblem in philosophy of information is relevant:\n\nOpen problem: Can meaning be reduced to computation?\n\n\nThe question is interwoven with more general issues in philosophy and\nits answer directly forces a choice between a more\npositivistic or a more hermeneutical approach to\nphilosophy, with consequences for theory of knowledge, metaphysics,\naesthetics and ethics. It also effects direct practical decisions we\ntake on a daily basis. Should the actions of a medical doctor be\nguided by evidence based medicine or by the notion of\ncaritas? Is a patient a conscious human being that wants to\nlead a meaningful life, or is he ultimately just a system that needs\nto be repaired? \n\nThe idea that meaning is essentially a computational phenomenon may\nseem extreme, but here are many discussions and theories in science,\nphilosophy and culture that implicitly assume such a view. In popular\nculture, e.g., there is a remarkable collection of movies and books in\nwhich we find evil computers that are conscious of themselves (2001,\nA Space Odyssey), individuals that upload their consciousness\nto a computer (1992, The Lawnmower Man), and fight battles in\nvirtual realities (1999, The Matrix). In philosophy the\nposition of Bostrom (2003), who defends the view that it is very\nlikely that we already live in a computer simulation, is illustrative.\nThere are many ways to argue the pros and cons of the reduction of\nmeaning to computation. We give an overview of possible arguments for\nthe two extreme positions: \n\n\n\nMeaning is an emergent aspect of computation: Science is our\nbest effort to develop a valid objective theoretical description of\nthe universe based on intersubjectively verifiable repeated\nobservations. Science tells us that our reality at a small scale\nconsists of elementary particles whose behavior is described by exact\nmathematical models. At an elementary level these particles interact\nand exchange information. These processes are essentially\ncomputational. At this most basic level of description there is no\nroom for a subjective notion of meaning. There is no reason to deny\nthat we as human being experience a meaningful world, but as such this\nmust be an emergent aspect of nature. At a fundamental level it does\nnot exist. We can describe our universe as a big quantum computer. We\ncan estimate the information storage content of our universe to be\n\\(10^{92}\\) bits and the number of computational steps it made since\nthe big bang as \\(10^{123}\\) (Lloyd 2000; Lloyd & Ng 2004). As\nhuman beings we are just subsystems of the universe with an estimated\ncomplexity of roughly \\(10^{30}\\) bits. It might be technically\nimpossible, but there seems to be no theoretical objection against the\nidea that we can in principle construct an exact copy of a human\nbeing, either as a direct physical copy or as a simulation in a\ncomputer. Such an \u201cartificial\u201d person will experience a\nmeaningful world, but the experience will be emergent.  \n\n\nMeaning is ontologically rooted in our individual experience of\nthe world and thus irreducible: The reason scientific theories\neliminate most semantic aspects of our world, is caused by the very\nnature of methodology of science itself. The essence of meaning and\nthe associated emotions is that they are rooted in our individual\nexperience of the world. By focusing on repeated observations of\nsimilar events by different observers scientific methodology excludes\nthe possibility of an analysis of the concept of meaning a\npriori. Empirical scientific methodology is valuable in the sense\nthat it allows us to abstract from the individual differences of\nconscious observers, but there is no reason to reduce our ontology to\nthe phenomena studied by empirical science. Isolated individual events\nand observations are by definition not open to experimental analysis\nand this seems to be the point of demarcation between science and the\nhumanities. In disciplines like history, literature, visual art and\nethics we predominantly analyze individual events and individual\nobjects. The closer these are to our individual existence, the more\nmeaning they have for us. There is no reason to doubt the fact that\nsentences like \u201cGuernica is a masterpiece that shows the\natrocities of war\u201d or \u201cMcEnroe played such an inspired\nmatch that he deserved to win\u201d uttered in the right context\nconvey meaningful information. The view that this information content\nultimately should be understood in terms of computational processes\nseems too extreme to be viable. \n\n\nApart from that, a discipline like physics, that until recently\noverlooked about 68% of the energy in the universe and 27% of the\nmatter, that has no unified theory of elementary forces and only\nexplains the fundamental aspects of our world in terms of mathematical\nmodels that lack any intuitive foundation, for the moment does not\nseem to converge to a model that could be an adequate basis for a\nreductionistic metaphysics. \n\nAs soon as one defines information in terms of true statements, some\nmeanings become computational and others lack that feature. In the\ncontext of empirical science we can study groups of researchers that\naim at the construction of theories generalizing structural\ninformation in data sets of repeated observations. Such processes of\ntheory construction and intersubjective verification and\nfalsification have an inherent computational component. In fact,\nthis notion of intersubjective verification seems an essential element\nof mathematics. This is the main cause of the fact that central\nquestions of humanities are not open for quantitative analysis: We can\ndisagree on the question whether one painting is more beautiful than\nthe other, but not on the fact that there are two paintings. \n\nIt is clear that computation as a conceptual model pays a role in many\nscientific disciplines varying from cognition (Chater &\nVit\u00e1nyi 2003), to biology (see entry on\n biological information)\n and physics (Lloyd & Ng 2004; Verlinde 2011, 2017). Extracting\nmeaningful models out of data sets by means of computation is the\ndriving force behind the Big Data revolution (Adriaans & Zantinge\n1996; Bell, Hey, & Szalay 2009; Hey, Tansley, & Tolle 2009).\nEverything that multinationals like Google and Facebook\n\u201cknow\u201d about individuals is extracted from large data\nbases by means of computational processes, and it cannot be denied\nthat this kind of \u201cknowledge\u201d has a considerable amount of\nimpact on society. The research question \u201cHow can we construct\nmeaningful data out of large data sets by means of computation?\u201d\nis a fundamental meta-problem of science in the twenty-first century\nand as such part of philosophy of information, but there is no strict\nnecessity for a reductionistic view. \n",
