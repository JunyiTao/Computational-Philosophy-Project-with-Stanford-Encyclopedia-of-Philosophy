    "main_text": "Political Obligation in Historical Perspective || Utility and Obligation\n1.4 Utility and Obligation\n\nFor all its influence in other areas of legal, moral, and political\nphilosophy, utilitarianism has found few adherents among those who\nbelieve that there is a general obligation to obey the laws of one\u2019s\ncountry. Part of the reason for this situation may be the fact that\nJeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and others who followed Hume\u2019s path\nhad little to say about political obligation. A more powerful reason,\nthough, is that utilitarians have trouble accounting for obligations\nof any kind. If one\u2019s guiding principle is always to act to maximize\nexpected utility, or promote the greatest happiness of the greatest\nnumber, then obligations seem to have little or no binding force.\nAfter all, if I can do more good by giving the money in my possession\nto charity than by paying my debts, then that is what I should do,\nnotwithstanding my obligations to my creditors. By the same reasoning,\nwhether I should obey or disobey the law is a matter to be settled by\nconsidering which will do more good, not by determining whether I have\nan obligation to obey.\n\nSome utilitarian philosophers have struggled to overcome this problem,\neither by pointing to reasons to believe that respecting obligations\nserves to promote utility or by restricting calculations of utility to\nrules or norms rather than to individual acts (see the entry on\n\u201cconsequentialism\u201d for details). Whether their efforts\nhave been successful remains a matter of debate. There seems to be a\nconsensus, however, that the most sophisticated attempts to provide a\nutilitarian grounding for political obligation, such as those of Rolf\nSartorius (1975, chaps. 5 and 6) and R. M. Hare (1976), have proved\nunsuccessful (e.g., Simmons 1979, pp. 45\u201354; Horton 2010, pp.\n60\u201369). As a result, utilitarianism seldom figures in the\ndebates of those contemporary political philosophers who continue to\nbelieve that there is, in some political societies, a general\nobligation to obey the law.\n",
