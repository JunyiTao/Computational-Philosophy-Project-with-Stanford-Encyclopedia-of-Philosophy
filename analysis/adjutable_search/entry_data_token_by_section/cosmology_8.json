The question can be posed more precisely in\nterms of the region that is, in principle, accessible to an observer\nat a location in spacetime \\(p\\)\u2014the causal past,\n\\(J^-(p)\\), of that point. This set includes all regions of spacetime\nfrom which signals traveling at or below the speed of light can reach\n\\(p\\). What can observations confined to \\(J^-(p)\\), assuming that GR\nis valid, reveal about the spacetime geometry of \\(J^-(p)\\) itself,\nand the rest of spacetime?\n\nThe observational cosmology program (Kristian & Sachs 1966; Ellis\net al. 1985) clarifies the extent to which a set of ideal observations\ncan determine the spacetime geometry directly with minimal\ncosmological assumptions. (By contrast, the standard approach starts\nby assuming a background cosmological model and then finding an\noptimal parameter fit.) Roughly put, the ideal data set consists of a\nset of astrophysical objects that can be used as standard candles and\nstandard rulers. If the intrinsic properties and evolution of a\nvariety of sources are given, observations can directly determine the\narea (or luminosity) distance of the sources, and the distortion of\ndistant images determines lensing effects. These observations thus\ndirectly constrain the spacetime geometry of the past light cone\n\\(C^-(p)\\). Number counts of discrete sources (such as galaxies or\nclusters) can be used to infer the total amount of baryonic matter,\nagain granting various assumptions. Ellis et al. (1985) proved the\nremarkable result that an appropriate idealized data set of this kind\nis sufficient, if we grant that EFE hold, to fully fix the spacetime\ngeometry and distribution of matter on the past light cone \\(C^-(p)\\),\nand from that, in the causal past \\(J^-(p)\\) of the observation point\n\\(p\\).[18]\nObservers do not have access to anything like the ideal data set,\nobviously, and in practice cosmologists face challenges in\nunderstanding the nature of sources and their evolution with\nsufficient clarity that they can be used to determine spacetime\ngeometry, so this is the ideal situation.\n\nWhat does \\(J^-(p)\\) reveal about the rest of spacetime? In classical\nGR, we would not expect the physical state on \\(J^-(p)\\) to determine\nthat of other regions of spacetime\u2014even the causal past of a\npoint just to the future of \n\\(p\\).[19] \nThere are some models in which \\(J^-(p)\\)\ndoes reveal more: \u201csmall universe\u201d models are closed\nmodels with a finite maximum length in all directions that is smaller\nthan the visual horizon (Ellis & Schreiber 1986). Observers in\nsuch a model would be able to \u201csee around the universe\u201d in\nall directions, and establish some global properties via direct\nobservation because they would be able to see all matter that\nexists.[20]\n\n\nUnless this is the case, the causal past for a single observer, and\neven a collection of causal pasts, place very weak constraints on the\nglobal properties of spacetime. The global properties of a spacetime\ncharacterize its causal structure, such as the presence or absence of\n singularities.[21]\n General relativity tolerates a wide variety of global properties,\nsince EFE impose only a local constraint on the spacetime geometry.\nOne way to make this question precise is to consider whether there are\nany global properties shared by spacetimes that are constructed as\nfollows. For a given spacetime, construct an indistinguishable\ncounterpart that includes the collection of causal pasts\n\\(\\{J^-(p)\\}\\) for all points in the original spacetime. The\nconstructed spacetime is indistinguishable from the first, because for\nany observer in the first spacetime there is a \u201ccopy\u201d of\ntheir causal past in the counterpart. It is possible, however, to\nconstruct counterparts that do not have the same global properties as\nthe original spacetime. The property of having a Cauchy surface, for\nexample, need not be shared by an indistinguishable\n counterpart.[22]\n More generally, the only properties that are guaranteed to hold for\nan indistinguishable counterpart are those that can be established\nbased on the causal past of a single point. This line of work\nestablishes that (some) global properties cannot be established\nobservationally, and raises the question of whether there are\nalternative justifications.\n",
