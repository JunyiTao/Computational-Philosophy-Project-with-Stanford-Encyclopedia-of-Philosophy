    "main_text": "\n\nSome phenomena within nature exhibit such exquisiteness of structure,\nfunction or interconnectedness that many people have found it natural\nto see a deliberative and directive mind behind those phenomena. The\nmind in question is typically taken to be supernatural.\nPhilosophically inclined thinkers have both historically and at\npresent labored to shape the relevant intuition into a more formal,\nlogically rigorous inference. The resultant theistic arguments, in\ntheir various logical forms, share a focus on plan, purpose,\nintention, and design, and are thus classified as teleological\narguments (or, frequently, as arguments from or to design).\n\nAlthough enjoying some prominent defenders over the centuries, such\narguments have also attracted serious criticisms from major historical\nand contemporary thinkers. Critics and advocates include not only\nphilosophers but also scientists and thinkers from other disciplines\nas well. In the following discussion, major variant forms of\nteleological arguments will be distinguished and explored, traditional\nphilosophical and other criticisms will be discussed, and the most\nprominent contemporary turns (cosmic fine tuning arguments,\nmany-worlds theories, and the Intelligent Design debate) will be\ntracked. Discussion will conclude with a brief look at one\nhistorically important non-inferential approach to the issue.\n",
