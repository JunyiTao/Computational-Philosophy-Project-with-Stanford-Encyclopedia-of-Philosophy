    "main_text": "The aftermath of the Principia II: debates with Leibniz\n7. Newton\u2019s impact on philosophy\n\nThe history of eighteenth-century philosophy cannot be written without\nextensive discussion of Newton\u2019s own views and of his influence\non the views of other figures both in England and on the Continent. As\nwe have seen, when Newton was a young student at Trinity College,\nCambridge, Cartesian views in natural philosophy and much else besides\nhad replaced the ideas and methods of Aristotle and his followers as\nthe most important subject for discussion amongst philosophers. In\nmany ways, Newton eventually succeeded in convincing philosophers that\nhis own ideas and methods were superior to those of the\nCartesians\u2014especially when it came to thinking about motion and\nits causes\u2014but this historical fact did not mean that\nNewtonianism, even broadly construed, became the dominant trend in\nnatural philosophy during Newton\u2019s lifetime. On the contrary,\nNewton\u2019s views continued to be the subject of intense scrutiny\nand debate. As we have seen, this was true amongst Leibniz and his\nfollowers (such as Christiaan Wolff) and among fellow mechanists (such\nas Huygens). Indeed, a late-seventeenth-century debate between\nCartesian and Newtonian ideas was supplanted by an early eighteenth\ncentury debate between Leibnizian and Newtonian views; the latter\ndebate would continue in one form or another for the rest of the\ncentury. But even amongst leading Continental mathematicians, some of\nNewton\u2019s most basic ideas, for instance concerning the forces of\nnature, remained the subject of dispute until well into the eighteenth\ncentury. To give just one prominent example that influenced the\ndevelopment of philosophy, D\u2019Alembert and Euler, two of the\ngreatest mathematicians of the Enlightenment, had opposite reactions\nto Newton\u2019s idea that the mass of an object could also be\nreferred to by the \u201cvery significant name\u201d of the vis\ninertiae, or force of inertia (Newton 1999, 404\u2014see below\nfor details). These discussions, along with numerous other debates\nabout space, time, motion were a driving force during the French\nEnlightenment. They remained a powerful stimulant to philosophical\ntheorizing in the 1770s and 1780s, when Kant forged his magisterial\n\u201ccritical\u201d system of philosophy, an approach that almost\nsingle-handedly set the philosophical agenda of the early nineteenth\ncentury. Hence Newton\u2019s influence on the eighteenth century did\nnot take the form of a single philosophical program or movement;\ninstead, it was the controversial nature of his ideas and methodology\nthat drove much of the philosophical discussion.\n\nNewton\u2019s ideas and methods were certainly most influential in\nBritain, where there grew to be a strong \u201cNewtonian\u201d\nmovement\u2014also called the \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d\nprogram\u2014by roughly 1700. By the fin de siecle, it is\nprobably safe to say that natural philosophy had become heavily\nNewtonian in England, at least in the sense that it had eclipsed both\nCartesianism (Henry 2013: 124 and introduction to Voltaire 1738 [1992,\n7]), and other local movements, such as Cambridge Platonism, which had\nexhibited a strong influence during the previous generation. One might\nput the point somewhat differently: to the extent that there was a\ndominant strand in England by 1700, it was the \u201cexperimental\nphilosophy\u201d, a view that was associated strongly with figures\nsuch as Boyle, Newton and Locke. Figures such as Hobbes had opposed\nthis approach to solving philosophical problems, but had failed to\ngain nearly as much influence. Perhaps more importantly,\nNewton\u2019s view of motion, his understanding of space and time,\nand his approach to achieving knowledge of natural phenomena, helped\nto shape the agenda of British philosophy for the next fifty years. In\naddition to Newton\u2019s influence on Locke\u2019s thinking about\nmatter and causation, explored above, both Berkeley and Hume expended\nconsiderable energy grappling with the wider consequences and\nimplications of the Newtonian version of the experimental philosophy.\nFor his part, Berkeley famously derided many Newtonians methods and\nideas\u2014sometimes exempting Newton himself from his conception of\nthe worst philosophical excesses of his followers\u2014including the\nrise of the calculus among mathematicians (in The Analyst)\nand the use of the idea of a force as the basic causal concept in\nnatural philosophy (in De Motu\u2014both reprinted in\nBerkeley 1992). Berkeley\u2019s theory of ideas, which arose in part\nfrom his reflections of what we would now call Locke\u2019s\n\u201cempiricist\u201d notion of representation, suggested to him\nthat no idea can be abstract: each idea must represent a\nparticular rather than a universal. Hence we can have an idea\nof a particular car, say a yellow two-door sports car, but not of a\ncar in general, one with no specific characteristics. Similarly, we\ncan have an idea of a particular shade of yellow, perhaps because\nwe\u2019ve just seen a lovely yellow rose at the florist, but not of\nyellow in general; and so on. Berkeley then argued that modern\nmathematics, especially the calculus, and modern natural philosophy,\nespecially Newtonian versions of it, were often reliant on abstract\nideas, and therefore philosophically suspect. For instance, he\ncontended that the very idea of absolute motion was suspect because we\ncan represent to ourselves only various motions with particular\nfeatures related to particular bodies in motion, but\n\u201cabsolute\u201d motion cannot be rendered particular\nin anything like this way; it remains abstract (Downing 2005: 235).\nThus although Newtonian views were considered to be essential to the\nrise of experimental philosophy in Britain, Berkeley derided them as\ninsufficiently experimental, or empirical, as overly reliant on\nrepresentations of universals and of universal quantities, rather than\non the representation of particulars. In a reflection of\nMalebranche\u2019s influence, Berkeley also argued that some\nNewtonians wrongly attributed genuine causal powers to ordinary\nmaterial objects through their use of the concept of impressed force;\nwrongly, because Berkeley firmly rejected the notion that any body\ncould exert any causal power. All causation in Berkeley\u2019s system\nis due either to the intervention of the divine in the course of\nhistory, or to spirits or minds, which are genuinely causally active.\nFinally, in an argument that would prefigure Mach\u2019s reactions to\nNewtonian conceptions of space, time and motion in the late nineteenth\ncentury\u2014which were expressive of a broad commitment to\n\u201cempiricism\u201d\u2014Berkeley contended that absolute space\nis a metaphysical aberration: philosophers should not posit any entity\nor thing that is beyond all possible perception. In sum, Berkeley was\nhighly critical of many aspects of the Newtonian program, but for that\nvery reason, it was Newton\u2019s ideas that helped to shape many of\nhis philosophical projects.\n\nFor his part, Hume had a more nuanced reaction to the emergence of the\nNewtonian program (cf. Schliesser 2007 and DePierris 2012). He\ncertainly signaled his endorsement of the experimental\nphilosophy\u2014itself strongly associated with the Newtonians, along\nwith figures like Boyle and Hooke, as we have seen\u2014when he gave\nhis Treatise the following subtitle: \u201cbeing an attempt\nto introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral\nsubjects\u201d. And one might argue that Hume made a kind of Lockean\nmove when he chose to endorse the Newtonian program specifically in\npreference to the mechanical philosophy, which he regarded with\nsuspicion. A famous comment from his History of England\nbolsters this interpretation:\n\n\nWhile Newton seemed to draw off the veil from some of the mysteries of\nnature, he showed at the same time the imperfections of the mechanical\nphilosophy; and thereby restored her ultimate secrets to that\nobscurity, in which they ever did and ever will remain. (Hume 1854\n[1754\u201361]: vol. 5: 374)\n\n\nThe difference between Locke and Hume might be that the former, unlike\nthe latter, nonetheless insisted that mechanism continued to provide\nphilosophers with a canon for the intelligibility of causation within\nnature (Hume\u2019s critique of earlier conceptions of causation,\nincluding Locke\u2019s, is certainly well known). Hume also expended\nconsiderable effort in interpreting some of the philosophical aspects\nor consequences of Newton\u2019s theory of gravity and his\ncorresponding understanding of the nature of matter. In particular, he\nwished to provide what we would now call an empiricist interpretation\nof Newton\u2019s three laws of motion, his concept of mass (quantity\nof matter), and his understanding of gravity; in the process, he does\nnot shy away from interpreting Newton\u2019s sometimes confusing\nnotion of the vis inertiae or force of inertia. When students\nlearn the canonical idea of a Newtonian force, they learn about what\nNewton called a vis impressa, an impressed force. They also\nlearn that the mass of a body is not a force at all. But in all three\neditions of the Principia, Newton himself said that although\nthe mass of a body is not an impressed force, it could be called by\nthe \u201cvery significant name of force of inertia\u201d because\nbodies with mass with resist acceleration (Newton 1999, 404). And to\nresist acceleration seemed to Newton like an action that a body\nperforms, say when some other body collides with it. Now for Hume,\nthis issue was particularly difficult because he had already contended\nthat strictly speaking, we have no idea (no representation) of force\nor power\u2014these are merely words employed by natural philosophers\nwithout any ideas corresponding to them. Thus he must find an\ninterpretation of Newton that is not predicated on our ability to form\nan idea of forces or powers. In a famous footnote in his Enquiry\nConcerning Human Understanding, he writes (Hume 1777 [1993:\n\u00a7vii.i note 2, 48\u201349]):\n\n\nI need not examine at length the vis inertiae which is so\nmuch talked of in the new philosophy, and which is ascribed to matter.\nWe find by experience, that a body at rest or in motion continues for\never in its present state, till put from it by some new cause; and\nthat a body impelled takes as much motion from the impelling body as\nit acquires itself. These are facts. When we call this a vis\ninertiae, we only mark these facts, without pretending to have\nany idea of the inert power; in the same manner as, when we talk of\ngravity, we mean certain effects, without comprehending that active\npower. It was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second\ncauses of all force or energy; though some of his followers have\nendeavoured to establish that theory upon his authority. On the\ncontrary, that great philosopher had recourse to an ethereal active\nfluid to explain his universal attraction; though he was so cautious\nand modest as to allow, that it was a mere hypothesis, not to be\ninsisted on, without more experiments.\n\n\nIn mentioning Newton\u2019s speculation that an aether might explain\nuniversal gravity in some sense (for instance, in query 21 to the\nOpticks), Hume does not appear to be concerned about action\nat a distance; instead, he is concerned to argue that this speculation\nindicates that Newton himself did not regard his theory as requiring\nthat we attribute a \u201cpower\u201d of gravity to material bodies.\nThis is important for Hume to establish, not least because he believes\nthat we can form no representation at all of any such power.\nSimilarly, when Newton indicates in the Principia that we can\nconceive of a body\u2019s quantity of matter as its vis\ninertiae, its power of resisting any change to its state of\nmotion (Newton 1999: 404\u20135), he is not attributing any power to\nthat body, but rather employing a means of characterizing its\nbehavior. Or so Hume contends. In this specific regard, we find an\necho of Berkeley\u2019s earlier work: in De Motu, Berkeley\nargues in particular that although some philosophers misunderstand the\nNewtonian theory of gravity as attributing a special force or nature\nto material objects, there is an interpretation of Newton that is\nconsistent with the new theory of ideas. He writes (Berkeley 1992:\nDe Motu, \u00a76):\n\n\nAgain, force, gravity, and terms of that sort are\nmore often used in the concrete (and rightly so) so as to connote the\nbody in motion, the effort of resisting, etc. But when they are used\nby philosophers to signify certain natures carved out and abstracted\nfrom all these things, natures which are not objects of sense, nor can\nbe grasped by any force of intellect, nor pictured by the imagination,\nthen indeed they breed errors and confusion.\n\n\nThere is little doubt, then, that the new British philosophy\nrepresented by Locke, Berkeley, and Hume in the early-to-mid\neighteenth century was concerned to present interpretations of\nNewton\u2019s work that were consistent with their overarching\nphilosophical commitments, principles and methods, or to alter those\ncommitments, principles and methods as necessary.\n\nThese attempts by canonical philosophers like Berkeley and Hume to\nfind what they regarded as a defensible interpretation of Newtonian\nforces are mirrored by similar attempts in the writings of leading\nmathematicians. For instance, the very same issue discussed by Hume\nhad already been debated by two of the leading figures in Continental\nscience, D\u2019Alembert and Euler. For his part, in his famous work,\nthe Trait\u00e9 de dynamique (1743), D\u2019Alembert\nexpressed a view that is very similar to Hume\u2019s (in certain\nrespects). He proclaimed right at the outset that he wished to develop\na physics that would dispense with the concept of a force altogether\non the grounds that it was an \u201cobscure\u201d idea. He would\n\u201creduce all the principles of mechanics to three, the force of\ninertia, compound motion, and equilibrium\u201d (D\u2019Alembert\n1743, 3). He immediately explained the first item: the reason that he\ncould accept Newton\u2019s force of inertia is that it\u2019s\ncharacterized as a property of bodies, one in virtue of which they\nfollow the laws of motion, rather than a force or power. So it was not\nan obscure notion. Ironically, the great Swiss mathematician Euler had\nprecisely the opposite reaction: from his point of view, the\n\u201cforce of inertia\u201d was simply a misnomer, for it was not a\nforce at all and should therefore be expunged from physics altogether.\nInstead, physics should employ only the idea of an impressed force, a\ncause of acceleration, which he regarded as a perfectly clear idea. Of\ncourse, history was on Euler\u2019s side, indeed so much so that\nfuture generations would not even imagine that so many leading\nphilosophers and mathematicians during the Enlightenment debated this\ntopic.\n\nIn other respects, in France the intellectual situation was rather\ndifferent than in England. Cartesian ideas held sway for many decades\nafter Newton first emerged on the scene in the 1670s with his optics\npapers and in the late 1680s with the Principia; they were\nespecially popular at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, unlike\nthe situation in the Royal Society (Henry 2013: 120). Voltaire became\nfamous for challenging the Cartesian French orthodoxy, traveling to\nEngland for a celebrated visit and bringing home\n\u201cenlightened\u201d ideas about philosophy, politics, and much\nelse besides in an attempt to foment the emergence and development of\na French Newtonian program. His most important publication in this\nregard is probably the Elements of the philosophy of Newton\n(Voltaire 1738/1992), which attempts to signal the\n\u201cerrors\u201d of Descartes and to highlight the advantages of\nthe Newtonian program in \u201cPhysique\u201d. Of course, Cartesian\nideas and methods retained numerous adherents and defenders in France,\nand so the debate between Cartesian and Newtonian ideas flourished in\nthat environment (cf. Aiton 1972: ch. 8). But even in France,\nCartesianism eventually gave way to a newer version of metaphysics\nassociated with Leibniz and his German follower and expositor, Wolff.\nIn 1740, \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet, published a key text,\nInstitutions de physique, or Foundations of physics\n(see especially the analysis in Brading 2019). In her\ntext\u2014which was republished in a second edition in 1742 and\nswiftly translated into German and Italian\u2014she makes precisely\nthe kind of argument that presses Hume a few years later to articulate\na conception of the vis inertiae that is consistent with the\nexperimental philosophy. She argues that the Cartesian view that\nextension is the essence of body is mistaken; we must conceive of\nmaterial objects as exhibiting a \u201cforce\nd\u2019inertie\u201d if we are to understand their physical\ninteractions properly (Du Ch\u00e2telet 1742: ch. 1, \u00a72).\nPerhaps not surprisingly, D\u2019Alembert cites her text approvingly\nin his Treatise on Dynamics. From Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s\npoint of view, this Newtonian conception of body is not inherently\nproblematic. Problems arise, however, when some Newtonians interpret\nthe theory of universal gravity as proving that bodies have a property\nof attraction or attractive power endowed by God (Du Ch\u00e2telet\n1742: ch. 16, \u00a7385). She accepts the idea that gravity is\nproportional to the masses of bodies and inversely proportional to the\nsquare of their spatial separation, arguing that this Newtonian idea\nof attraction \u201cmarvelously\u201d explains the fall of bodies on\nearth, the tides, and various astronomical phenomena, something that\nthe vortex theory of the Cartesians fails to do. But she denies that\nthis acceptance entails that she must also accept the conclusion that\nbodies have an \u201cessential property\u201d called gravity or\nattractive force, contending that such a conclusion transcends the\nknowledge available to philosophers (Du Ch\u00e2telet 1742: ch. 16,\n\u00a7388). The reason is that no one had yet demonstrated that there\nis no medium for gravity, such as a vortex or an aether: since gravity\nmay depend on some medium, it may not be essential to matter per\nse. In this specific way, Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s work is\npredicated on the familiar notion that although Cartesianism had been\noverthrown by Newtonian ideas and methods, philosophers must\nnonetheless develop a proper interpretation of the Newtonian theory of\ngravity and of its implications. Yet unlike Voltaire, who not only\nrejected Cartesianism, but became famous for his ridicule of\nLeibnizian philosophy in Candide, Ch\u00e2telet argued that\nphilosophers should continue to work on developing the proper\nmethodology in part by taking seriously the ideas and methods of\nLeibniz and Wolff. In particular, Ch\u00e2telet argued that the\nprinciple of sufficient reason should be a guiding force in\nmetaphysical theorizing, and as Leibniz had argued, it shows the\nfundamental error in Newton\u2019s concept of absolute space; she\nadded that Clarke\u2019s method of replying to Leibniz\u2019s\nargument, viz., that one can develop a non-Leibnizian or voluntarist\nconception of the PSR to evade the problem with absolute space, is\nunderwhelming (Du Ch\u00e2telet 1742: ch. 5, \u00a774). She also\nargued that if we use the PSR to guide our thinking about science, we\nwill be skeptical of Locke\u2019s solution to the problem of\nunderstanding the philosophical implications of Newton\u2019s theory\nof universal gravity. The idea that Newton\u2019s theory supports the\nconclusion that God must have \u201csuperadded\u201d gravity to\nmatter avoids potential problems with asserting that gravity is\n\u201cessential\u201d to matter, something she also regards\nskeptically, but simply encounters other problems. First, since no one\nyet understood whether there was any medium underlying gravitational\ninteractions, such as an aether, it was premature to conclude that\ngravity is a property of matter, even one \u201csuperadded\u201d to\nit by divine fiat. After all, if there is an aether, then matter may\ngravitate because of its interactions with the aether, and not because\nof any superadded property. Second, the PSR demands that we seek\nrational explanations of natural phenomena in our science, but the\nsuperaddition thesis is predicated on the idea that we simply cannot\nunderstand how matter gravitates toward other matter. Newton\u2019s\nscience is simply taken to indicate that it does so. She was unwilling\nto leave the most important conclusion of the Scientific Revolution a\nmere mystery.\n\nEuler\u2019s rejection of the vis inertiae was not his only\nmajor reaction to Newton\u2019s science. The question of whether to\naccept, and of how to interpret, absolute space, time and motion, and\nthe related question of how to conceive of the relation between\nNewton\u2019s work in natural philosophy and the flourishing\nLeibnizian-Wolffian metaphysics on the Continent, continued to drive\nconversations in the middle of the eighteenth century. Just a few\nyears after Ch\u00e2telet published her Institutions, Euler\npresented a novel approach to these two questions in a short paper\nentitled \u201cReflexions sur l\u2019Espace et le Temps\u201d,\nfirst published in 1748 in the M\u00e9moires de\nl\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences de Berlin. The Berlin\nAcademy had been witnessing a vociferous debate between Wolffians and\nNewtonians since 1740 (a debate that would continue until roughly\n1759), one in which Euler played a role. Whereas one might regard the\nBritish philosophers, especially Berkeley and Hume, as arguing that\nphilosophical principles and commitments take a kind of precedence in\ndriving one\u2019s interpretations of the concepts of force, motion,\nspace and time, Euler argued that natural\nphilosophy\u2014specifically, mechanics\u2014ought to take\nprecedence. The famous first sentence of his essay indicates why: he\ncontends that the principles of mechanics\u2014for instance, the\nprinciple of inertia\u2014are so well established that it would be\nfoolish to doubt them (Euler 1748: 324). In particular, if one\u2019s\nmetaphysical commitments stand in tension with the concepts of space\nand motion found in geometry and mechanics, then one must adjust those\ncommitments accordingly. Euler then presented a clever argument: the\nlaw of inertia picks out rectilinear motion as a special kind of\nmotion, so to apply it to bodies in nature, there must be a clear\nmeaning to the idea of a straight line. But if space is merely the\norder of relations amongst material bodies, then any set of reference\nbodies we use to determine which motion is straight could itself be in\nmotion. So to employ the idea of rectilinear motion, we require the\nnotion of absolute space (see DiSalle 2006, 36-37).\n\nThe most important figure in German-speaking Europe to react in depth\nto Newton\u2019s ideas was surely Immanuel Kant. As a young man, Kant\nwas influenced by Euler\u2019s argument (Friedman 1992: 16\u201317)\nin the 1748\n piece.[26]\n Kant began grappling with Newtonian ideas at the very beginning of\nhis career\u2014he discussed the inverse-square law in his first\npublication (Kant 1747: \u00a7 10)\u2014and they would remain central\nboth to his magnum opus, the Critique of Pure Reason (Kant\n1787 [1992]) and to his Metaphysical Foundations of Natural\nScience (1786 [2002]). In the so-called pre-critical period, Kant\ndiverged sharply from the approach toward natural philosophy defended\nby many Leibnizians in German-speaking Europe by deciding to accept\nthe Newtonian theory of universal gravity, along with corresponding\naspects of the Newtonian conception of matter, as a starting point for\nphilosophical theorizing (Friedman 2012: 485\u20136). He makes this\nexplicit already in 1763, in The Only Possible Argument:\n\n\nI will attempt to provide an explanation of the origin of the world\nsystem according to the general laws of mechanics, not an explanation\nof the entire natural order, but only of the great masses of matter\nand their orbits, which constitute the most crudest foundation of\nnature \u2026 I will presuppose the universal gravitation of matter\naccording to Newton or his followers in this project. If\nthere are any who believe that through a definition of metaphysics\nformulated according to their own taste they can annihilate the\nconclusions established by men of perspicacity on the basis of\nobservation and by means of mathematical inference\u2014if there are\nsuch persons, they can skip the following propositions as something\nwhich has only a remote bearing on the main aim of this essay. (Kant\n1763: AK 2: 139)\n\n\nA rare case of Kantian irony, it seems. Already in this early text,\nKant has clearly broken with his predecessors both in England and on\nthe Continent, who insisted on disputing Newton\u2019s theory of\nuniversal gravity, either on metaphysical or theological grounds.\nInstead, Kant\u2019s work will be predicated on that theory. But Kant\nnever became an orthodox Newtonian, any more than an orthodox\nLeibnizian (or Wolffian). This is evident from the radically different\nfates of two classic Newtonian concepts within the Kantian system: the\nidea that the theory of universal gravity shows that gravity is a\nfeature of material bodies, along with the related concept of action\nat a distance, on the one hand; and absolute space, on the other. The\nquotation from 1763 above indicates that Kant was willing to endorse\nNewton\u2019s theory of universal gravity, despite the many\nobjections raised against it by his Leibnizian predecessors. Indeed,\nhe was also willing to accept the most radical interpretation of that\ntheory, one according to which every material body in the world should\nbe understood as bearing a feature called gravity, one that involves\nthat body in actions at a distance on all other such bodies. As Kant\nputs it dramatically in Proposition 7 of the second chapter of\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science: \u201cThe\nattraction essential to all matter is an immediate action of matter on\nother matter through empty space\u201d (Kant 1786 [2002: 223]; AK 4:\n512). This view is radical in two senses: first, it involves the\nhighly controversial claim that gravity is essential to matter, which\nindicates that a body lacking gravitational interactions would\npotentially fail to count as a material entity at all (much as an\nearlier generation of philosophers would conceive of extension as\nessential to matter); and second, it also involves the debated idea\nthat material bodies act at a distance on one another. One can\nconceivably endorse the latter without endorsing the former,\ncontending, e.g., that although material bodies in the actual world\nact at a distance on one another, perhaps because of a divine plan, it\nis perfectly possible for material bodies to fail to do so\nunder distinct worldly conditions (i.e., there may be possible worlds\nin which material bodies lack gravity altogether). That is, the\nendorsement of action at a distance does not entail the endorsement of\nthe essentiality claim. Both ideas are controversial, and Kant\nstrongly endorses them both. This placed him in a rather select group\nof radical Newtonians (Friedman 1992: 1 note 2). Kant himself\nunderstood that Newton may not have endorsed these controversial\nviews, arguing that he was inconsistent on this score (see Remark 2 to\nProposition 7 of chapter 2, AK 4: 514\u201316; Friedman 2012:\n203\u201321). And yet Kant strongly resisted the other most\ncontroversial Newtonian idea, absolute space, along with the related\nidea of absolute motion (Friedman 2012: 35\u201342). In the\nCritique of Pure Reason, for instance, Kant expressed a\nbasically Leibnizian sympathy by arguing that there are fundamental\nmetaphysical (and perhaps epistemic) difficulties with thinking of\nspace and time as existing independently of all objects and all\npossible relations among them as \u201cactual entities\n\u201d(wirkliche Wesen\u2014A23/B37) in their own right. He\ndoes so in a passage that (perhaps confusingly) characterizes the\nLeibnizians as also defending a kind of realism about space, but we\ncan focus solely on his criticism of the Newtonians:\n\n\nThose, however, who assert the absolute reality of space and time,\nwhether they assume it to be subsisting or only inhering, must\nthemselves come into conflict with the principles of experience. For\nif they decide in favor of the first (which is generally the position\nof the mathematical investigators of nature), then they must assume\ntwo eternal and infinite self-subsisting non-entities (space and\ntime), which exist (yet without there being anything real) only in\norder to comprehend everything real within themselves. (A39/B56)\n\n\nIf one regards space (like time) as existing independently of all\nobjects and all possible relations, and yet one admits that space is\ncausally inert and imperceptible, as one presumably must in the late\neighteenth century, then one is committed to the idea that there is a\nkind of infinite and eternal non-entity in the world. Space is a kind\nof non-entity, Kant suggests, because on the one hand it is said to\nexist independently of everything else, and yet on the other hand, it\nis said to be causally inert and imperceptible, which would\ndistinguish it from every other sort of thing that exists. Kant simply\ncannot stomach this metaphysically preposterous notion. It is\ntherefore incumbent upon him to develop a theory of space (and of\nmotion) that meets at least two distinct criteria: (1) it coheres with\nhis understanding of the theory of universal gravity, and of what he\nregards as its implication, viz. that gravity is an essential feature\nof material bodies; and, (2) it avoids the metaphysically problematic\naspects of Newtonian absolute space. Kant tackles precisely these\ntasks in the Metaphysical Foundations, which was published in\nbetween the appearance of the first and second edition of the\nCritique, arguing that we can regard absolute space as a kind\nof idea of reason, an ideal that we approach asymptotically in our\ntheorizing about motion. Absolute space is therefore nothing more than\na kind of ideal within our philosophy, and no longer a harmful aspect\nof our ontology.\n\nNewton\u2019s influence on the development of philosophy did not end\nwith the close of the eighteenth century. Most obviously, the concepts\nof absolute space and absolute motion continued to play fundamental\nroles in philosophical theorizing about space and motion more\ngenerally for the next two centuries, and they remain fundamental to\ndiscussions today (DiSalle 2006). Newton has also had a deep and\nlasting influence on numerous other topics in what we now call the\nphilosophy of science, including the status of our knowledge of\nnatural phenomena, the best ideas about scientific methodology, the\nstatus of the laws of nature, and much else besides (McMullin 2001 and\nSmith 2001). It is no exaggeration to say that Newton has a permanent\nplace in the history of modern philosophy.\n",
