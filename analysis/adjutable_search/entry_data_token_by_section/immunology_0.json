However, this system is known to\nplay other functions in the organism that include \n\n regeneration and repair of damaged tissues, scar formation, and\nwound healing (Forbes and Rosenthal 2014); \n surveillance against malignancies (Swann and Smyth 2007); \n regulation of ontogenetic transformations (Ramos 2012); \n modulation of nutrient metabolism (Zmora et al. 2017); \n establishment of mutualistic relationships with commensals\n(Kurashima and Kiyono 2017); \nregulation of sexual partner selection and prevention of fusion\nbetween genetically discordant individuals (Davis 2014); \nmodulation of neuro-functions by affecting mood, memory,\ncognition, social behavior and spatial learning (Derecki et al. 2010;\nFiliano et al. 2016); and \n participation in a bidirectional crosstalk with other bodily\ncells by means of a variety of growth factors and metabolic regulatory\nsignals (Burzyn, Benoist, and Mathis 2013; Davies et al. 2013). \n\n\nThus, by responding to the inner and outer environments of the\norganism, the immune system participates in many capacities to\ncoordinate diverse physiological functions and to provide\ncommunication between them. Immunity thus relies upon cognitive\nfunctions coupled to an array of effector mechanisms that have\nwide-ranging regulative, reparative, and defensive capabilities.\nBeyond the philosophical significance of these immune-mediated\nfunctions, studies of immunity are uniquely positioned to address\ncentral problems in\n philosophy of biology (see entry)\n and, more broadly, philosophy of science. These include the\nreductionism/holism debate, the characterization of the goals and\nmethods of systems biology, the organization of cognition and\ninformation, and the challenge of integrating complexity theory with\nbig data studies.\n\nDespite the multifaceted role of the immune system and its importance\nin promoting survival and persistence of all forms of life (Pradeu\n2012: 22\u201332), immunology has traditionally been of minor\ninterest to philosophers of biology (cf. Hull and Ruse 2007; Sarkar\nand Plutynski 2010). However, increased attention has recently been\ndirected to address a range of ontological and epistemological\nproblems related to immune phenomena. These studies have focused upon\nthe \u201cimmune self\u201d, the central motif of biological\nidentity in the context of immunity (Tauber 1994; Pradeu 2012).\nRanging over diverse topics, including personal identity (Howes 1999),\nethical and anthropological concerns with human self-image (Sontag\n1990; E. Martin 1994), and poststructuralist, constructivist and\nfeminist notions of identity (Derrida 2003; Haraway 1989; Weasel\n2001), philosophers have invoked immunological conceptions of\nselfhood. Moreover, the examination of immunology has proven\nincreasingly useful in addressing philosophical problems pertaining to\nother fields of study such as ecology (Tauber 2017), neuro- and\ncognitive sciences (Varela et al. 1988), developmental biology (Fagan\n2007), microbiology (M\u00e9thot and Alizon 2014) and evolutionary\nbiology (Hull, Langman, and Glenn 2001). This increased recognition of\nimmunology in philosophy of biology not only reflects a growing trend\ntowards more inclusive approaches, more generally, but also\ncontributes to the intensifying effort to understand ecological\ndynamics that range from microbial interactions to climate change\n(O\u2019Malley and Dupre 2007; O\u2019Malley 2014).\n\nImmunologists have long applied philosophy to elaborate conceptual\nframeworks for understanding the immune system and to shed light on\nthe character of experimental conduct in this biomedical field\n(Anderson 2014). To highlight the common culture of immunology and\nphilosophy, a prominent Australian immunologist, Macfarlane Burnet,\nwrote in 1965: \u201cImmunology has always seemed to me more a\nproblem in philosophy than in practical science\u201d (Burnet 1965).\nHe was inspired by Whitehead in elaborating his notion of immune\nselfhood and by his attempts to apply cybernetics and information\ntheory to immunology (Anderson and Mackay 2014). Another influential,\nphilosophically-oriented immunologist, Niels Jerne, admitted to having\nbeen influenced by Kierkegaard\u2019s discussion of Plato\u2019s\nMeno when elaborating his key conceptual ideas (i.e., the\nselection theory of antibody production) (Jerne 1966, S\u00f6derqvist\n2003: 186). And perhaps most prominently, Ludwik Fleck\u2019s\nimmunological and bacteriological research served as the case example\nof a \u201cthought collective\u201d that has served as the founding\nstudy of the social character of scientific change in biology and\nscience (L\u00f6wy 1986; Fagan 2009; see the entry on\n Ludwik Fleck).\n Many other prominent immunological researchers, including\nMetchnikoff, Zinsser, Medawar, Edelman and Salk, were also humanist\nthinkers who, in addition to active laboratory research, conspicuously\nexpounded philosophical ideas on the nature of reality, the character\nof cognition, the limits of science, the condition of humankind, and\nthe like. Thus, a rich bidirectional exchange between philosophy and\nimmunology has been established over a long tradition.\n",
