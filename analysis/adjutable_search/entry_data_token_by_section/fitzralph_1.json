    "main_text": "Writings\n2. Writings\n\n\nFitzRalph was a prolific author and most of the works from his\nmature period are of a theological or pastoral nature, or, indeed,\npolemical writings concerned with the anti-mendicant controversy. \nAnd whereas some topics are dealt with such as future contingents (in\nthe Summa de Quaestionibus Armenorum) or the question of\ndominium, it is to his earlier work, the Lectura on the\nSentences, dating from 1328\u201329, that we must look to for more\nphilosophical themes. FitzRalph was also the author of a (now\nlost) Commentary on the Physics which brought him into\nconflict with Richard Kilvington. Furthermore, some logical works\nonce attributed to FitzRalph are now to be attributed to another\nArmachanus, John Foxhalls (Johannes Anglicus) (Dunne 2013b). The most\nextensive treatment to date of FitzRalph\u2019s thought as presented\nin the Lectura is that by Gordon Leff (1963). Leff\u2019s\nbook gives a good overview of FitzRalph\u2019s thought and is generous\nwith quotations from the text itself. What emerges from Leff\u2019s\nexamination is that a good deal of FitzRalph\u2019s Lectura\nwas not concerned with theology at all, or at least only tangentially\nso. For example, when dealing with the theological problem of the\ncreation of the world, the discussion focuses on topics (such as the\neternity of the world) that FitzRalph had already dealt with in his\ncommentary on the Physics (Dunne 2008).\n",
