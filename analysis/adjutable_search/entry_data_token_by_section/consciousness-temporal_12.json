For the doctrine\nto be plausible we must be able to make clear sense of the idea that\nexperienced duration can be contained in episodes of experiencing that\nare themselves without discernible duration, and retentionalists also\nneed to be able to provide a plausible account of how retentions can\ndo the job required of them. For a number of recent\ntheorists\u2014e.g., Grush, Kiverstein, Lee and Tye\u2014a currently\npopular theory of the nature of perceptual experience helps\nretentionalism solve these and other problems.\n\nIn the philosophy of perception representationalism (or\nintentionalism) is the doctrine that the phenomenal\nproperties we encounter in perception are determined by, or supervene\nupon, \u201crepresentational\u201d contents. Needless to say\nrepresentations come in very different forms, and the variety deployed\nby recent representationalists is of a distinctive kind. As Siegel\nusefully notes:\n\n\nwhen one speaks of the contents of a newspaper, one is talking about\nwhat information the newspaper stories convey. Many contemporary uses\nof \u201cthe contents of perception\u201d take such contents to be\nanalogous to the contents of a newspaper story. (2005 [2021:\n\u00a72])\n\n\nThe stories we encounter in newspapers often make claims about the\nworld, and can be assessed for their truth or accuracy, and one way of\nspecifying the content of a story is by specifying what would have to\nbe the case if the story is true. Representationalists maintain that\nthe contents carried by perceptual experiences are similar: we can\nspecify their content by specifying the conditions under which they\nare true (or reliable). Importantly, on this view perceptual\nexperiences can have representational contents even if the story they\nare telling is false: we do, after all, misperceive things from time\nto time\u2014a balloon which looks red might turn out to be\norange.\n\nRepresentationalists hold that, quite generally, the properties of a\nrepresentational vehicle (that which is doing the\nrepresenting) and the content of that representation (what is\nrepresented) need to be sharply distinguished. The word\n\u201cred\u201d can represent the colour red without itself\nbeing red. A copy of a newspaper is very different from the stories it\ntells. In the case of temporal experience anyone who finds this theory\nof perception appealing can adopt a quite straightforward position on\nthe nature of retentions: the latter provide us with a direct\nawareness of the recent past because they are perceptual experiences\npossessing meaningful contents that represent the recent past. The\nproblem of understanding how the experienced duration and succession\ncan exist in experiences that are durationless (or almost so) now has\na straightforward solution. As we have just seen, representational\nvehicles and their contents typically do have very different\nproperties, and this is a case in point. In the representationalist\nframework it would be a mistake to expect the temporal properties of\nan experience, a vehicle, to match those of its content.\n\nHoerl (2013a) argues that some of Husserl\u2019s otherwise puzzling\npronouncements become a good deal less puzzling if we suppose that he\nchanged his stance from something akin to a sense-datum theorist (in\nhis early days) to something akin to contemporary representationalism\n(in his later days). Husserl tells us that \u201cMemory\u2014and\nthis is equally true of retention\u2014is not image-consciousness, it\nis something totally different\u201d (Husserl TPZ [1991: 36]). He\nalso says that as a primal impression is transformed into a\nretention\n\n\nthere is a radical alteration, an alteration that can never be\ndescribed in the way in which we describe the changes in sensations\nthat lead again to sensations. (Husserl TPZ [1991: 336])\n\n\nWe can see how Husserl might have thought this true is he had (in\neffect) adopted\n representationalism.[17]\n\nThere is a further doctrine defended by many representationalists that\nis also relevant to our current concerns: an insistence on the\n\u201ctransparency\u201d of experience. By this they typically mean\n(in part at least) that in ordinary perceptual experience, we have no\nawareness whatsoever of our experiences themselves, we are simply\naware of the (worldly) objects and properties that are presented in or\nby our experiences. If our experiences are invisible, there is no need\nto introduce properties of experience\u2014phenomenal\nproperties, qualia, sense-data and such\u2014in order to explain the\ncontent and character of our ordinary perceptual consciousness.\nExtending this approach to the particular case of temporal\nconsciousness, Michael Tye argues as follows. First of all, if we\nassume the transparency thesis is true, the traditional assumption\nthat it is experiences that are related by succession or\nsimultaneity is misguided:\n\n\nConsider again the case in which I have an experience of a red flash\nfollowed by a green flash. Here I experience two colored\nflashes as occurring one after the other. I do not experience\nmy experience of a red flash as succeeding my\nexperience of a green one any more than I experience my\nexperience of a red flash as red. (2003: 96)\n\n\nAccordingly, Tye holds that anyone seeking to account for our ability\nto directly apprehend change by appealing to a unifying relationship\nbetween experiences is also misguided: there simply aren\u2019t the\ntoken experiences there to beunified; a given period or\nstretch of consciousness is not composed of successive perceptions or\nexperiences (2003: 102). By way of an alternative he offers a one\nexperience view of streams of consciousness:\n\n\nThe simplest hypothesis compatible with what is revealed by\nintrospection is that, for each period of consciousness, there is only\na single experience\u2014an experience that represents everything\nexperienced within the period of consciousness as a whole. (2003:\n97)\n\n\nFor a recent defence of Tye\u2019s general approach to transparency\nin the case of temporal experience see Heeney (2021). As Bayne notes,\nTye\u2019s one experience proposal does not sit easily with some of\nhis other views. Tye holds that experiences are representational\nstates that have the ability to directly feed into our cognitive\nsystems. Bayne asks:\n\n\nIs it really plausible to suppose that the contents of an entire\nstream of consciousness\u2014that is, the period of consciousness\nbetween one state of unconsciousness and the next\u2014are poised for\ndirect input in to the reasoning system? \u2026 That seems\nextremely unlikely. (Bayne 2005: 498)\n\n\nSoteriou (2010: 230) is also puzzled by this aspect of Tye\u2019s\nposition.\n\nFor discussion of some further issues relating to retentional specious\npresents see the supplementary document\n The Specious Present: Further Issues.\n",
