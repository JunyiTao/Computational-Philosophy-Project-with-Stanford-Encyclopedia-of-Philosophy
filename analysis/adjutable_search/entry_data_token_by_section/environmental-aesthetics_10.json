    "main_text": "Environmental Aesthetics beyond Natural Environments || The Aesthetics of Human Environments\n4.1 The Aesthetics of Human Environments\n\nBoth the cognitive and the non-cognitive orientations in environmental\naesthetics have resources that are brought to bear on the aesthetic\ninvestigation of human and human-influenced environments. Of the\ninitial positions, some non-cognitive approaches have made the most\nsubstantial contributions to this area of research. The aesthetics of\nengagement is particularly significant in this regard, constituting a\nmodel for the aesthetic appreciation not simply of both nature and\nart, but also of every other aspect of human experience; it studies\nthe aesthetic dimensions of rural countrysides, small towns, large\ncities, theme parks, gardens, museums, and even human relationships.\nMoreover, although, as is clear from the early collections of essays\nin environmental aesthetics (Kemal and Gaskell 1993, Carlson and\nBerleant 2004), the field initially concentrated on natural\nenvironments, the aesthetics of engagement, unlike most other\napproaches, from very early on focused not simply on natural\nenvironments, but also on human environments and especially on urban\nenvironments (Berleant 1978 1984 1986). Much of this material is\navailable in more recently published volumes (Berleant 1997 2004 2005\n2010b 2012). It has become a foundation for a substantial body of\nresearch on the aesthetic appreciation of urban and as well as other\nkinds of environments (Haapala 1998, von Bonsdorff 2002, Blanc 2013,\nPaetzold 2013, Alvarez 2017). Other non-cognitive accounts, such as\nthat which stresses imagination, likewise illuminate our aesthetic\nresponses to a range of human environments as well as to our use of\nthem for purposes such as resource extraction and agricultural\nproduction (Brady 2003 2006).\n\nCognitive accounts also investigate the aesthetic appreciation of\nhuman environments, arguing that, as with natural environments,\nappropriate appreciation depends on knowledge of what something is,\nwhat it is like, and why it is as it is. Scientific cognitivism claims\nthat for human environments knowledge provided by the social sciences,\nespecially history, is equally as relevant to aesthetic appreciation\nas that given by the natural sciences (Carlson 2009). For appropriate\nappreciation of rural and urban environments, as well as specialized\nenvironments such as those of industry and agriculture, what is needed\nis information about their histories, their functions, and their roles\nin our lives (Carlson 1985 2001, Parsons 2008b, Parsons and Carlson\n2008). Other approaches emphasize the aesthetic potential of cultural\ntraditions, which seem especially relevant to the appreciation of what\nmight be termed cultural landscapes\u2014environments that constitute\nimportant places in the cultures and histories of particular groups of\npeople. What is often called a sense of place, together with ideas and\nimages from folklore, mythology, and religion, frequently plays a\nsignificant role in individuals\u2019 aesthetic experience of their\nown home landscapes (Saito 1985, Sep\u00e4nmaa 1993, Carlson 2000,\nSandrisser 2007, Firth 2008, Nomikos 2018).\n\nFruitful approaches to the aesthetic appreciation of human\nenvironments can also be found in views that draw on both cognitive\nand non-cognitive points of view. There have been attempts to\nexplicitly forge connections between the two orientations (Foster\n1998, Moore 1999 2008, Fudge 2001), and there are several collections\nand studies that, moving beyond the cognitive/non-cognitive\ndistinction, inform our understanding of the appreciation of an array\nof environments and address issues that arise concerning them\n(Berleant and Carlson 2007, Arntzen and Brady 2008, Herrington 2009,\nBrady et al 2018). There are investigations of both rural\nlandscapes (Sep\u00e4nmaa 2005, von Bonsdorff 2005, Andrews 2007,\nBenson 2008, Leddy 2008, Brook 2013, Benovsky 2016) and urban\ncityscapes (von Bonsdorff 2002, Macauley 2007, Sep\u00e4nmaa 2007,\nErzen and Milani 2013, Frydryczak 2015) as well as more specialized\nenvironments, such as industrial sites (Saito 2004, Maskit 2007, Kover\n2014), shopping centers (Brottman 2007), restored and rewilded\nenvironments (Heyd 2002, Prior and Brady 2017, Brady et al\n2018), and even environments after the end of nature (Vogel 2015).\nBeyond the consideration of these larger, more public environments,\nthe aesthetics of everyday life becomes especially relevant.\n",
