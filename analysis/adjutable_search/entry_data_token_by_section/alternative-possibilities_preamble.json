    "main_text": "\n\nSuppose you harm, offend, or otherwise wrong another person.\nConfronted with the possibility of sanction, you might say any of the\nfollowing in an attempt avoid blame: \u201cI couldn\u2019t help\nit.\u201d \u201cSomeone made me do it.\u201d \u201cI had no\nchoice.\u201d \u201cIt was unavoidable.\u201d \u201cThere was no\nother option.\u201d There\u2019s a natural reading of such defenses\non which they appeal to the principle at the center of this entry, the\n\u201cPrinciple of Alternative Possibilities\u201d (cp. Frankfurt\n1969):\n\n\nPrinciple of Alternative Possibilities (PAP): a\nperson is morally responsible for what she has done only if she could\nhave done otherwise.\n\n\nAlthough its precise form and interpretation have varied, this\nprinciple has enjoyed broad support in the history of philosophy. PAP\nwas a standard\u2014even if not universal\u2014presupposition of\nGreek, medieval, and early modern thought (Irwin 1999: 225; Pasnau\n2003: 226; Rowe 1987: 43). And until about fifty years ago, it was\nusually taken for granted by both sides in debates on whether moral\nresponsibility is compatible with determinism.\n\nNo doubt the principle\u2019s appeal can in part be traced to\nordinary moral practice. One day at the cafeteria, Kurt steals\nJohn\u2019s lunch. Under normal circumstances, we hold Kurt\nresponsible for his act. But now add that he had to act as he did.\nSuppose, for example, that Kurt was coerced by a bully to steal\nJohn\u2019s lunch; or he is suffering from a neurological disorder\ncompelling him to act; or he was brainwashed. These are some of the\nmany ways in which his alternatives can be closed off. But however\nthis happens, once the alternatives are gone\u2014once Kurt must act\nas he does\u2014blaming him no longer seems appropriate.\n\nPAP presents one requirement for moral responsibility. There are\nothers. For example, we often excuse those who act out of ignorance.\nSuppose it turns out that, contrary to initial reports, Kurt\nreasonably mistook John\u2019s lunch for his own; it was this\ninnocent mistake that resulted in the \u201ctheft\u201d. Here too we\nshould be much less inclined to blame Kurt, for in the relevant sense,\nhe didn\u2019t know what he was doing. Such examples suggest that in\naddition to PAP, there is an epistemic condition for responsibility.\nAnd there are still other candidate requirements. But while some of\nthem are closely related to the ability to do otherwise, for the most\npart they will, like the epistemic condition, be set to one side in\nthis entry: the focus will be on PAP.\n",
