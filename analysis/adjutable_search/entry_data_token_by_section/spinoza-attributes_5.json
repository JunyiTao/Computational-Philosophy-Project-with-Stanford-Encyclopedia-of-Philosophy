    "main_text": "Attributes in the Ethics || Extension as a Divine Attribute\n1.5 Extension as a Divine Attribute\n\nOne of the important things that Spinoza does in the first two parts\nof the Ethics is to establish Extension as a divine attribute\n(elements of this view are evident already in KV I/25). Although\nSpinoza adopts many important aspects of Cartesian metaphysics, he\ncollapses the divide between the infinite and created substances. This\nmeans that principal attributes that were at the \u201ccreated\nsubstance\u201d level in the Cartesian set-up are \u201cmoved\nup\u201d, so to speak, to the infinite substance level for Spinoza.\nOne of these attributes is, of course, Extension. Spinoza has to\nexplain to a resistant audience how Extension can be considered a\ndivine attribute.\n\nThe important steps that will allow Spinoza to claim that Extension\ncan be an attribute of God are the following. He defines God as a\nsubstance consisting of infinite attributes\n (1D6).[9]\n He shows that substances cannot share attributes (1P5), that every\nsubstance is infinite (1D8), that a single substance can have several\nattributes (1P10schol), and that an infinite substance exists (1P11).\nWith an eye towards specifically establishing Extension as a divine\nattribute, he claims in 1P12: \u201cNo attribute of a substance can\nbe truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be\ndivided.\u201d In 1P13, he states: \u201cA substance which is\nabsolutely infinite is indivisible,\u201d and in the corollary, he\nmakes the point especially clear with respect to Extension:\n\u201cFrom these propositions it follows that no substance, and\nconsequently no corporeal substance, insofar as it is a\nsubstance, is divisible.\u201d In 1P14, he establishes that\nthere is only one substance (or rather, that there are no created\nsubstances). Finally in 1P15 he claims: \u201cWhatever is, is in God,\nand nothing can be or be conceived without God.\u201d With this, the\nstage is set for Extension being a divine attribute or applicable to\nGod, if in fact it is a genuine attribute (which is established only\nin Part Two).\n\nSpinoza is aware that this will be received with great resistance. The\npossible objection he imagines is that since Extension is divisible by\nits very nature then, if Extension were an attribute of God, God would\nbe divisible. God, of course, cannot be divisible, for then he would\nnot be infinite. In the Scholium to 1P15 he shows the ensuing\ncontradictions if one holds Extension to be by its very nature\ndivisible. It is important for him to show that Extension cannot imply\ndivisibility in answer to possible objectors holding traditional\nviews. Moreover, he has just shown that there is only one substance,\nwhich is indivisible (1P12 and 1P13), and so whatever attributes it\nhas, none of them can imply divisibility in the only substance.\nSpinoza then shows that if Extension is an attribute, it is applicable\nto God, and there is no danger of that implying any real division in\nthe substance. One important result of this is that what appear to be\nindividuated bodies cannot be really individuated in the Cartesian\nsense of implying real distinction and the existence of multiple\nsubstances. Rather, what appear to be individuated bodies are only\nmodes of substance under the attribute of\n Extension.[10]\n Only in Part Two does Spinoza show that Extension (as well as\nThought) are in fact attributes of God: \u201cThought is an attribute\nof God, or [sive] God is a thinking thing\u201d\n(2P1) and \u201cExtension is an attribute of God, or\n[sive] God is an extended thing\u201d (2P2).\n",
