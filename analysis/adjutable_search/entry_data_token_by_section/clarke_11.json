    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || God, Space, and Time\n4.2 God, Space, and Time\n\nAccording to traditional Christian theology, God is eternal and\nomnipresent. Clarke accepted both, but his attempts to explain what\nthose claims mean are not always clear. Four central tenets of\nClarke\u2019s position are unpacked below.\n\nGod is able to act at all times and in all places because he\nis substantially present in all times and in all places. To\ndeny this would entail accepting action at a distance, which Clarke,\nlike most of his contemporaries, found mysterious or impossible (Brown\n2016).\n\nGod\u2019s substantial presence entails that the Scholastic view\nof divine eternity and immensity is false. Clarke rejected the\nview of God as substantially removed from space and time. Divine\neternity involves both necessary existence and infinite duration\nwhich, however, could not be identified with the traditional notion of\nthe eternal present (nunc stans) according to which God\nexists in an unchanging permanent present without any successive\nduration. He considered such a view unintelligible at best and\ncontradictory at worst (CC 107, W 3.794). The attribution of\nsuccessive duration to God might suggest that God, like us, is in time\nbut, unlike us, does not change. However, this was not Clarke\u2019s\nview. In his exchanges with Butler he clarifies that God is not\ntechnically in space and time, because God is prior (in the order of\nnature) to time whereas things in time are metaphysically subsequent\nto the existence of time. Moreover, he attributed distinct and\nsuccessive thoughts to God; otherwise God could not \u201cvary his\nwill, nor diversify his works, nor act successively, nor govern the\nworld, nor indeed have any power to will or do anything at all\u201d\n(W 3.897). Hence, God is immutable with respect to his will only in\nthe sense that he does not change his mind.\n\nGod is not identical to space or time; although necessary, they\ndepend for their existence upon God. Clarke\u2019s earliest\nreported philosophical idea, years before he read Newton, is that God\ncannot destroy space (Whiston 1730, 22\u201323). A common worry about\nabsolute space in the eighteenth century was that if space is\ninfinite, necessary, and indestructible then either God is not the\nonly infinite, necessary, and independent being or God is identical to\nspace, both of which were theologically unorthodox. Clarke\u2019s\nposition in the Demonstration, the letters to Butler, and the\nletter to an anonymous author (almost certainly Daniel Waterland) is\nthat space and time are divine attributes or properties, a view he may\nhave found in Henry More (Thomas 2015, 18). Because they depend on the\nonly self-subsisting being, they are not independent beings (D\n122\u2013123, W 4.758). He told Leibniz that immensity and eternality\nare \u201can immediate and necessary consequence\u201d of\nGod\u2019s existence, without supplying any further argument or\nexplaining the relationship between \u201cconsequence,\u201d\n\u201cmode,\u201d \u201cattribute,\u201d and\n\u201cproperty.\u201d Many have understood Clarke to mean that God\nis literally dimensional. Clarke\u2019s early critic Anthony Collins\n(1713, 47\u201348) read him this way. Emily Thomas (2018, 172\u2013176)\nhas recently provided strong evidence that Clarke\u2019s views undergo a\nchange after 1719; from this point on Clarke is careful to say that\nimmensity and eternality are \u201cmodes of existence\u201d rather\nthan attributes, where modes of existence can be ascribed to God\nand to God\u2019s attributes, whereas an attribute cannot be\nascribed to any other attribute. For example, God is eternal and\nGod\u2019s intelligence is eternal, but God\u2019s will is not\nintelligent, so intelligence is an attribute but eternality is a mode\nof existence.\n\nGod\u2019s immensity and eternality are consistent with\nGod\u2019s unity. As Leibniz and Waterland noted, the\nidentification of divine immensity with space endangers the simplicity\nof the divine being because space has parts, albeit not separable\nones. The objection, though formidable, was not new; Bayle in the\nDictionnaire (entry \u201cLeucippus,\u201d remark G) had\nchided the Newtonians for identifying space with divine immensity in\norder to solve the ontological problem created by the positing of an\ninfinite space because it leads to the destruction of divine\nsimplicity and to various absurdities. As a further point, Waterland\nsuggests that since Clarke accepts that nothing with parts can be the\nsubject of consciousness, God\u2019s immensity also undermines divine\nintelligence and consciousness. Clarke offered two responses. Firstly,\nnot everything extended has parts. Space is extended, but (as Newton\nhad claimed) its \u201cparts\u201d cannot be moved, so they are not\ntruly parts. Secondly, Clarke claimed parity between spatial and\ntemporal extendedness: because the former is compatible with the\nsimplicity of what \u201cstretches\u201d temporally, the latter is\ncompatible with the simplicity of what stretches spatially. But the\nparity between space and time, were it to be granted, rather than\nshowing that spatial extendedness is not detrimental to a\nthing\u2019s simplicity because temporal extendedness is not, could\nbe taken to show that the latter is detrimental to a thing\u2019s\nsimplicity because the former is.\n",
