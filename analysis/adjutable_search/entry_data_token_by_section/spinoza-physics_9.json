    "main_text": "Individuation of bodies and the variety in matter || Interpreting \u201cmotion and rest\u201d\n5.2 Interpreting \u201cmotion and rest\u201d\n\nBut if this is right, then \u201cmotion and rest\u201d of the\nphysical interlude cannot simply be the ordinary motion and rest of\nbodies. What then are they? Klever waxes vague and anachronistic here,\nstraightaway seeking to validate his claim rhetorically by citing it\nas precedent of the view of contemporary physics: \u201cin this\nreversal [Spinoza] anticipates modern physics by which mass is\nconsidered as product of energy\u201d (ibid). (Hampshire (1987)\ncontains similar remarks).\n\nJonathan Bennett's influential reading agrees that Spinoza's physical\ntheory anticipates contemporary views. He also agrees that when\nSpinoza talks about \u201cmotion and\n rest\u201d[8]\n he is not invoking these terms in their ordinary senses. But rather\nthan simply identifying motion and rest with energy or any other trope\nof contemporary physical theory, Bennett holds that the terms function\nas mere placeholders for some basic physical quality, unknown to\nSpinoza, but required to make sense of the appearance of\nbodies\u2014ostensible things or subjects of predication\n\u2014 in the context of a metaphysics that holds that bodies, as\nmodes rather than substances, are not things or subjects at all, but\nrather ways that the one substance is. According to Bennett, Spinoza's\nExtension is, at the fundamental metaphysical level, a four\ndimensional field whose regions differ in the distribution and degree\nof this basic quality. Bodies are appearances, at one or more levels\nremoved from this base, of the continuous path in this field\nconstituted by relatively consistent local patterns of distribution of\nthis quality. The ordinary \u201cmotion\u201d of an ordinary\n\u201cbody\u201d is to be understood on the analogy with the way a\nthaw traverses a terrain. When the snow line recedes, there is no\nthing that changes its place; rather, there is a change in which\nregions of the landscape have the quality of being snow-covered, and\nthat change describes a continuous path.\n\nOne might object to that this analogy is not clearly persuasive.\nShifts of temperature lead to a thaw only because\nbodies\u2014ice crystals and aggregates thereof\u2014melt as\ntemperature rises, and their boundaries recede along the backdrop of a\nvery bodily landscape. Indeed, to thaw is just to pass from a solid to\na liquid state, and solidity is a benchmark of the bodily. If we\nexcise these bodily aspects of the analogy, it is unclear how much of\nits explanatory force remains. But then it is unclear just how well\nqualitative variations of fields can explain the appearance of bodies.\nPerhaps if we knew more about this quality, the sense in which such\ncontinuous paths of patterns of it could appear as or constitute\nbodies would be clearer. Garrett (1994) adopts Bennett's field\nmetaphysic, and attempts to fill in the explanatory gap by providing\ndefinite senses to the PI's uses of the terms \u201cmotion\u201d and\n\u201crest\u201d. Relying on Spinoza's remark, following\nPCP IIp22, that \u201cby force of moving bodies, we\nunderstand a quantity of motion \u2026. In bodies at rest, we\nunderstand by force of resisting a quantity of rest\u201d, Garrett\nclaims that by \u201cmotion\u201d and \u201crest\u201d in the PI,\nSpinoza means a quantity of force that moves a thing and a quantity of\nforce resisting such imposed movement, respectively. Furthermore,\nthese quantities can be ascribed, he says, to the regions of extension\nthemselves, rather than to bodies, thus overcoming the circularity\nproblem we found in Descartes. But it is unclear that Spinoza's text\ncan support this interpretation. PCP IIp22 speaks of the\nforce or motion \u201cin\u201d a body. Spinoza elaborates: \u201cBy\nforce in moving bodies, we understand a quantity of motion, which must\nbe greater, in bodies of equal size, as the speed of motion\nis greater \u2026 . But in bodies at rest we understand by\nforce of resisting a quantity of rest\u201d (emphasis added). In each\nmention, the force or resistance is attributed to a body. This\nstrongly suggests that quantity of motion and rest, as force and\nresistance, are features of\n bodies.[9]\n Moreover, even supposing that it makes interpretive sense to ascribe\nforce and resistance directly to regions, what is being attributed to\nthese regions seems to be a power to move bodies or to slow\nbodies down. Rather than showing how bodies could just be, or\narise from, fields of such forces, the forces themselves seem to be\ncharacterized in ways that presuppose body; the circularity, then,\nremains.\n\nIndividual bodies have an inherent stability, or robustness. They\nresist destructive incursion or change in their distinctive mode of\nendurance; they tend to persist in their configuration and motion in\nthe face of opposition to this persistence. Spinoza certainly accepts\nthis, as PID and IIIp6 show. If bodies either are, or are appearances\nof, persistent patterns of qualitative variation of extended regions,\nthen it seems necessary, though hardly sufficient, that something\nabout such patterns would have to account for this stability. But what\nmight do so? In effect, this is to ask what would account for the fact\nthat distributions of \u201cmotion\u201d and \u201crest\u201d,\nconceived of as predicates of extended regions, do not vary randomly\nthrough time. One suggestion is that nothing accounts for this\nstability at all, and that the duration of a body is nothing more than\nthe time through which a given complex ratio of motion and rest\nhappens, de facto, to characterize regions of extension whose sum over\ntime describes what can be construed as a continuous path. There is\nnothing to prevent such spatiotemporally continuous patterns from\noccurring. But there is nothing in being a time slice of such a\npattern that explains why the same pattern should also characterize\nany other spatiotemporal region continuous with it. There may, indeed\nmust, be kinematic 'laws' describing how such patterns vary (the scare\nquotes cause the counterfactual supporting status of such 'laws' would\nbe secured only by Spinoza's necessitarianism), but nothing about any\ngiven time slice of such patterns accounts for the fact that they are\nsubject to just those descriptive 'laws'. Individual time-slices of\nsuch patterns would be wholly passive with respect to the persistence\nand trajectory of the pattern as a whole.\n\nA significant problem with this\n line[10]\n is that Spinoza uses manifestly active language to describe the\ndoings of individuals. For example, IIId3 defines \u201caffect\u201d\nas \u201caffections of the body by which the body's power of\nacting is increased or diminished, aided or restrained, and at\nthe same time the idea of these affections\u201d (emphasis added).\nAnd in IIIp6, on which the entire psychological theory of the second\nhalf of the Ethics depends, Spinoza claims that individual\nthings strive to persevere in their being; his subsequent\nuses of the IIIp6 seem clearly to suggest that Spinoza intends this\nstriving to be understood as an a active principle rather than a mere\ntendency. On the conception of individuals as ratios of motion and\nrest that simply happen to endure, none of this would make\nany sense at all.\n\nViljanen, who also adopts Bennett's field metaphysic, with its\nimplicit denial that Spinozistic \u201cmotion and rest\u201d is to\nbe granted an ordinary signification, attempts to accommodate this\nconception of bodies as active and potent by reading the spatial field\nas a field of power, and bodies as constituted by differences in the\nintensity or strength of this power (Valjanen 2007, p. 402), and\napparent motion as the redistribution in that field of various\npatterns of intensification of that power (ibid., p. 403). He\nfurther interprets the \u201csimplest bodies\u201d of the PI \u2014\nthe basic constituents of all complex individuals \u2014 to be\ndistinguished as \u201crudimentary intensifications of spatial power,\nor extended power quanta, that invariably change place\u201d (Ibid.,\np. 408). But the question arises once again what the powers of which\nthese quanta are \u201cintensifications\u201d are powers to\ndo. They cannot, for reasons already mentioned, be powers to move\nor to resist bodies. The most obvious answer, in the Spinozistic\ncontext, would be \u201cpowers to persevere in its own being\u201d.\nBut to let the matter stand there would be simply to name the problem\nrather than to explain it. To the questions \u201cwhy does this\ndegree of spatial power persevere and endure in the (continuous) place\nand time to the extent that it does?\u201d, the answer would seem to\nbe \u201cbecause of the degree of power to persevere that constitutes\nit\u201d. But that is just to say that it manifests the powers it\ndoes because of the powers it has to do so \u2014 not very\nilluminating. \u201cMotion and rest\u201d as power appears to\nprovide either an incomplete or vacuous theory of indivuation.\n\nMoreover, if a body's motion in a spatial field, including that of the\nsimplest bodies, is just a change of location at which a given degree\nof power is instantiated, then there seems to be no means of\nexplaining why a particular degree of power would necessarily change\nlocations \u2014 move \u2014 continuously, as opposed to\ndiscontinuously. But surely it is in the nature of bodies as\nexplananda here that they are spatiotemporally continuous.\nFurthermore, if what individuates \u201cquanta of power\u201d are\njust their degrees of intensity \u2014 their degrees of power to\npersevere \u2014 then anywhere that degree is instantiated, that very\nsame body should be. But this would be consistent with the unlikely\nidea of discrete, discontinuous motion of a body, and indeed with the\nbi-location of bodies, that is, with the idea that a single body might\nbe wholly present in each of multiple regions. Assuming that Spinoza\nwould not accept these possibilities, the theory of \u201cmotion and\nrest\u201d as signifying spatial regions of power distinguished by\ndegrees of power fails to account for signal characteristics of body.\nIt is thus doubtful that the inadequacy of Descartes' identification\nof body with extension can be overcome simply by predicating regions\nof extension with different degrees of \u201cpower\u201d.\n\nThere are, then, reasons to doubt that granting Spinoza's \u201crest\nand motion\u201d a non-ordinary signification\u2014energy, an\nunspecified basic quality, force of motion and resistance,\nintensifications of power \u2014 can in fact give us insight into the\nconstitution or appearance of persisting, resistant, active bodies.\nBut it is worth asking whether these doubts in fact rest on an\ninappropriate imaginative basis. It seems difficult imaginatively to\nrepresent variegated fields of energy, force, or any other quality in\nsuch a way as to make clear how bodies, with the persistent resistance\nand capacities for interaction we ordinarily represent them to have,\ncould possible appear from or be constituted by them. But this sort of\nfailure of imaginative thinking cannot count against the acceptability\nof a theory from a proper Spinozistic perspective. On his view, our\nknowledge of body as an object of imagination is inherently\ninadequate. Our imaginative ideas of bodies in their corporeality are\nlimited to the ideas of modifications of our own bodies. These in turn\nreflect only in a confused and partial way the natures of both the\nbodies with which we are affected and our own. At no time is the full\nnature of any body reflected in any of the ideas we have through these\naffections, hence through anything we can imagine. Hence our\nimaginations cannot grasp the nature of body, and failure of the\nfaculty of imagination to provide insight into the link between the\nfundamental basis for variety in matter and that variety itself is to\nbe expected. All of this is clear from IIp16\u201331. Any appearance\nof insight into the nature of body gleaned from the imagination is as\nlikely to be illusion as illumination.  And, as Schliesser (2017)\nremarks in emphasizing Spinoza's skepticism about knowledge of the\nnatural world, for Spinoza, \u201cwhen we locate things at a time and\nplace, we are always in the realm of the imagination\u201d\n(p. 175).\n\nBut if we cannot come to an imaginative grasp of how bodies or their\nappearances might be constituted out of fields, then through what sort\nof intellectual act might we do so? In the context of early modern\nphilosophy of physical nature, and in particular the Cartesian\nphilosophy in which Spinoza is steeped, the clarity and distinctness\nof mathematical ideas provides the contrast to the incompleteness and\nconfusion of ideas of the imagination and sensation. And certainly the\nquantifiability of properly physical qualities, and consequently their\ncomprehensibility within a closed system of mathematical laws, is of\nthe utmost importance to the credentials of the fundamental notions of\nthe contemporary physical theory Spinoza is alleged to have\nanticipated. The scientific success of classical mechanics, relativity\ntheory, and, especially, quantum mechanics owes much more to the\npredictive and formal success of these theories than it does to our\nabilities to represent phenomena in the imagination that answer to the\nbasic physical elements they countenance. Point masses, gravitational\nforces operating at a distance, curvatures of space time, finite but\nunsurpassable velocities, and wave-packets all seem to surpass our\npowers of imaginative representation. We have no real capacity to\nimagine how the solid table on which my computer rests can be\nidentical to both a swirling cloud of particles and a warp in the very\nfabric of space. On the other hand, these fundamental scientific\nnotions can be rendered mathematically, placed within a system of\nlaws, and employed to great effect in predicting and manipulating,\nhence effectively representing, the same nature we represent\nimaginatively.\n\nThus perhaps the proper criterion, or at any event a proper\ncriterion, for the success of an Spinozistic account of variety in\nmatter and its individuation into bodies is the quantifiability of the\nbasic properties in which it proceeds. Gabbey stresses this line with\nadmirable clarity.\n\nTo talk of bodies maintaining among themselves \u201cthe same\nproportion of motion and rest,\u201d or communicating motion to each\nother \u201cin a certain fixed proportion\u201d is to say nothing\neffective, unless a mathematical account is provided of those\nproportions and of the measures of motion and rest from which they are\nformed, and unless there is some account of the laws that ensure the\nclaimed invariance in proportionalities. Spinoza provides no such\nlaws, nor does he say how the proportions are to be mathematically\nexpressed (Gabbey 1996, p. 168).\n\n\nGabbey concludes that the theory of bodily individuation by ratio of\nmotion and rest \u201clacks quantitative anchoring\u201d, and is\nthus \u201ctoo vague to allow a assessment of what is being\nclaimed\u201d (Gabbey 1996, p. 169).\n\nThat Spinoza did not himself provide the mathematicization of his\nnotion of motion-and-rest that would render his theory of body\nnon-circular and sufficiently clear to be understood (or imagined)\ndoes not entail that this cannot be done. A number of commentators\nhave attempted to show that Spinoza's account of variety in matter by\nappeal to \u201cmotion and rest\u201d can be so rendered. Garrett,\nwhose account we have already examined, nods his head in this\ndirection. Recall that PId5 defines an individual as being composed of\nbodies that \u201ccommunicate their motions to one another in a\ncertain fixed manner\u201d. Later lemmas characterize this fixed\nmanner as a \u201cratio\u201d of motion and rest. Notwithstanding\nhis realization that, for a number of reasons, such a ratio must be\nunderstood as a pattern rather than a numerical proportion, Garrett's\nexpresses sanguine confidence that \u201cany such pattern could be\nexpressed by a mathematical formula\u201d (1994, p. 86). Matson\n(1990) also places weight on the possible quantifiability of motion\nand rest as a means of in rendering it a clear and distinct,\nnon-imaginary basis for our understanding of the individuation of\nbodies, taking the idea of an atomic number as his model:\n\nBeing element No. 16 \u201cpertains to the essence\u201d of sulfur,\nas being yellow and smelly do not. One can in a sense\n\u201cimagine\u201d sulfur by its color and odor; but only by\narticulating it into the attribute, as the atomic number does, can one\nunderstand it\u2026. \u2018Element No. 16\u2019, together with the\ncomprehensive theory in which this conception is embedded, is a\nspecification of \u2018motion and rest\u2019, indicating, in fact,\nthat particular unique \u2018proportion of motion and rest\u2019\nthat is the necessary and sufficient condition for being sulfur.\n(Matson 1990, pp. 88\u201389).\n\n\nMatson piggybacks on to this analogy the formula for the identity of\nany living thing supposedly found in its genetic code.\n\nIf it is right to think of atomic numbers as the specifications of\nmotion and rest for certain stuffs, in the case of the human being (or\nany living creature) the obvious analogue is the genetic code, the\nformula for the structure of the individual's (quasi-unique) DNA\nmolecule (Matson 1990, p. 89).\n\n\nTreating such structures as representable by formulae enhances the\nimpression that they are expressible in numerically quantifiable\nterms.\n\nSuch attempts to interpret motion and rest as numerically expressible\nquantities constitute efforts to make Spinoza's physical theory\nrelevant to contemporary science, by displaying how it can conform to,\nand even constitute a blueprint for, its mathematical structure. They\nstand, then, as responses both to Gabbey's implication that because\nSpinoza does not say how his notion of motion and rest can be\nexpressed mathematically, his views are too vague and sterile to be of\nsuch contemporary relevance, and to the difficulties we have seen, in\nconceiving how motion and rest, as we conceive them imaginatively,\ncould possibly serve to individuate bodies. But at the end of the\nfinal section of this article, we will see that, quite apart from the\nvagueness, anachronism (Spinoza anticipating not just Mendeleyev, but\nalso Watson and Crick?) and other interpretative difficulties faced by\nsuch attempts, there are reasons to suppose that any effort to render\nbasic principles of physical theory through numerical quantification\nmay run deeply counter to Spinoza's own attitude.\n",
