    "main_text": "Sources, Ideas, Character of Writing, Terms: Christianity and Neoplatonism || Philosophy?\n4.3 Philosophy?\n\nAll of this looks so alien to the spirit of modern philosophy that we\nmay well ask if there is anything really philosophical in\nDionysius\u2019 practice? The answer has to be affirmative, for there\nis a perfectly reasonable pattern to the whole of Dionysius\u2019\nworks. In addition, Dionysius regards his own task as a kind of\ndemonstration (apodeixis) or showing (deixai). In\nthe Divine Names, such demonstration is given a Pauline\nresonance when Dionysius states that we should hold to the scriptural\nrevelation of divine names \u201cnot in the persuasive words of human\nwisdom, but in demonstration of the power granted by the Spirit\u201d\n(DN 585b; cf. Paul 1 Cor 2\u20134). In other words,\nDionysius here sees scripture as providing the basis for a deeper\nunderstanding of attribution or predication that will lead us beyond\nour own merely human capacities. That such a demonstration involves\nthe unpacking of the symbolic, contemplative, and mystical\nsignificances of ordinary things by the aid of scriptural testimony is\nclear in the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, which again starts\nfrom Dionysius\u2019 purpose of demonstrating what the hierarchy\ncomprises; and that this includes arguments, reasons, the possibility\nof debate and even improvement upon Dionysius\u2019 demonstrations by\nhis interlocutor becomes clear too at the end of the work, when the\nliterary humility that is characteristic of his writing (cf.\nEH 568a ff.; DN 981c\u2013984a; CH 340b)\nshows itself to be philosophically justified by Dionysius\u2019\nability to set out both sides of the case for and against infant\nbaptism in the understanding that he may not fully be in possession of\nthe most complete view of the situation and that his interlocutor\nshould \u201cuse\u201d what he has said \u201cas steps\n(epanabathmois) to a higher ray of light\u201d (EH\n568d\u2013569a). This is a thought couched in terms very reminiscent\nof Socrates\u2019 wish in the Republic to subvert or destroy\nhypotheses and use them as stepping stones to something better, and it\nis also a thought not unworthy of Wittgenstein\u2019s similar view at\nthe end of the Tractatus. The words immediately following\nmake clear the connection between charity of interpretation,\nopen-endedness and demonstration: \u201cBe generous with me then, my\ndear friend,\u2026 and show (deixon) to my eyes that more\nbeautiful and unified beauty which you may be able to see\u201d.\nDemonstration in this sense, then, includes much of what we might\nconsider to be properly philosophical, but at root it is also a form\nof \u201cdivine reading\u201d (lectio divina, or\nmeditative, prayerful reading) of nature and word, a receptive\nrecognition as a kind of method or making one\u2019s way \u201cto\nhear the sacred words as receptively as possible, to be open to the\ndivine workings of God, to clear an uplifting path\n(hodopoiesis) toward that inheritance that awaits us in\nheaven, and to accept our most divine and sacred regeneration\u201d\n(EH 392a).\n",
