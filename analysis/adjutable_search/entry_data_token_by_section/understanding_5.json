    "main_text": "Theoretical Frameworks || Psychology of Understanding\n2.2 Psychology of Understanding\n\nWith respect to the psychology of understanding, recall that the\npsychological element of propositional knowledge is typically\nconstrued in terms of belief, where belief is taken to be a\nkind of assent or saying \u201cYes\u201d to the content of the\nproposition. Thus to believe that the sky is blue is to assent to the\nproposition that the sky is blue; it is \u201ctaking it to\nbe true\u201d that the sky is blue.\n\nWhen we turn to understanding, by contrast, some have claimed that a\nnew suite of cognitive abilities comes onto the scene, abilities that\nwe did not find in ordinary cases of propositional knowledge. In\nparticular, some philosophers claim that the kind of mental action\nverbs that naturally come to the fore when we think about\nunderstanding\u2014\u201cgrasping\u201d and \u201cseeing\u201d,\nfor example\u2014evoke mental abilities \u201cbeyond belief\u201d,\ni.e., beyond simple assent or taking-to-be-true (for an overview, see\nBaumberger, Beisbart, & Brun 2017).\n\nFor instance, Elgin, de Regt, and Wilkenfeld argue that those who\ngrasp how things are connected are able to cognitively\n\u201cdo\u201d things that others cannot\u2014they can apply their\nunderstanding to new cases, for example, and draw new inferences.\n(See, for example, Elgin 1996: 122\u201324; de Regt 2004, 2017;\nWilkenfeld 2013). Thus car mechanics who understand how engines work\nare able to make sense of engines that they have not encountered\nbefore, and to anticipate how changes in one part of the engine will\ntypically lead (or fail to lead) to changes in other parts.\n\nGrimm claims that the distinctive nature of these abilities flows from\nthe distinctive nature of the objects of understanding (Grimm 2017).\nSuppose that the connections or relations one grasps are complex\nenough to constitute what we might call\n\u201cstructures\u201d\u2014structures with parts that depend upon\none another in various ways. Arguably, for the mind to take up these\nstructures in the right way, it is not enough simply to assent to\ntheir existence. Rather, one needs to appreciate how the structure\n\u201cworks\u201d, or how changes in its various parts will lead, or\nfail to lead, to changes in other parts.\n\nFor instance, suppose the structures to be grasped are represented by\n\u201ccausal maps\u201d or \u201cdependence maps\u201d\u2014maps\nwith nodes representing variables that can take on different values\nand thus represent directions of dependence (Gopnik & Glymour\n2002; Gopnik et al. 2004). In the schematic image below, from Gopnik\net al. (2004), the map represents a system in which changes to the\nvalue of Z bring about changes to the value of S,\nchanges to the value of S bring about changes to the values of\nX and R, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Grimm (2017), a striking feature of these maps is that\nthey are, as it were, \u201cmobile\u201d maps. That is, they are\ncognitive representations that by their very nature can adapt and\nchange as the variables represented by the map take on different\nvalues. Put another way, they are \u201cunsaturated\u201d maps, in\nthe sense that they are characterized in terms of unsaturated\nvariables that can become saturated by taking on different\nvalues. What this means in terms of cognitive uptake is important,\nGrimm argues, because if the maps are mobile or unsaturated in this\nway, then the mind that aptly takes them up must itself be mobile. In\nparticular, the mind that takes up causal maps in a way that yields\nunderstanding must be able to anticipate how varying or adjusting the\nvalue of one of the variables will lead (or fail to lead) to changes\nin the values of the other variables (cf. Woodward 2003).\n\nRelatedly, Alison Hills characterizes the distinctive psychological\nabilities that undergird understanding in terms of \u201ccognitive\ncontrol\u201d (Hills 2016). For example, Hills claims that in order\nto understand why it is right to give money to charity, it is not\nenough to simply believe the proposition that it is right to give\nmoney to charity because we owe assistance to the very needy\n(Hills 2016: 669), because I could accept a \u201cbecause\u201d\nclaim along these lines on the basis of testimony while having only a\nvery dim sense of how the two ingredient claims (that it is right to\ngive money and we owe assistance to the very needy) are related. What\nis needed in addition is an appreciation of the relationship between\nthese two claims. And what this involves, according to the cognitive\ncontrol view, is an ability to \u201cmanipulate\u201d the things\nstanding in relationship: for example, to be able to make a variety of\ninferences in light of the relationship (Hills 2016: 663).\n\nAlthough the views we have considered so far agree in thinking that\nthere is \u201csomething special\u201d from a psychological point of\nview about understanding, other accounts claim that there is nothing\nparticularly special about understanding\u2019s psychological\nprofile. More exactly, it is said that understanding does not appeal\nto any special abilities or capacities that we do not find in ordinary\ncases of knowledge.\n\nEmily Sullivan, for instance, claims that even if we grant that\nunderstanding involves abilities, it does not follow that there is\nsomething special about understanding from a psychological point of\nview, because ordinary propositional knowledge itself requires\nabilities (Sullivan 2018). Thus I can apparently only know that the\ntraffic light is red, in the actual world, if I would have gotten the\ncolor right in close possible worlds as well. More generally, knowing\nseems to require the ability to track the truth about the world, so\nthat when the world changes, my cognitive attitude about the world\nchanges with it. But this ability to be responsive to changing\nconditions is not obviously anything exotic, and it does seem to\nentail that the object of the mind is not a proposition (that the\ntraffic light is red seems like a paradigm example of a\nproposition, after all).\n\nAlong the same lines, Kareem Khalifa claims that abilities are\ninvolved in understanding, but holds that they are \u201cespecially\nunspecial\u201d (Khalifa 2017b: 56). For Khalifa, the modal character\nof abilities is evident in normal scientific practice, because as\nscientists evaluate explanations on the basis of testing they\nnaturally rule out inadequate explanations and gravitate towards\nwell-supported ones. But evaluating and testing hypotheses in this way\ndoes not appear to require anything exotic or special from a\npsychological point of view, or to entail that the object of\nunderstanding is not propositional.\n\nFinally, psychologists themselves have increasingly focused on\ncharacterizing the cognitive profile of understanding. Thus Tania\nLombrozo and colleagues have explored the question of why we seek\nunderstanding, and how activities such as offering explanations aid in\nthe acquisition and retention of understanding (Lombrozo, 2012;\nWilliams & Lombrozo, 2010, 2013; Lombrozo & Wilkenfeld 2019).\nPsychologists have also explored the empirical question of how good\n(or bad) we are at identifying real relationships and dependencies in\nthe world. According to Frank Keil, for example, we are not good at\nthis at all, and we frequently fall prey to illusions of understanding\n(Keil 2006; cf. Ylikoski 2009). For instance, we often think we\nunderstand how a helicopter achieves lift,\u00a0or how moving the\npedals on a bicycle help to propel the bike forward.\u00a0 But in both\ncases, we are often well wide of the mark (Keil 2006; cf. Grimm 2009;\nSloman & Fernbach 2017).\n",
