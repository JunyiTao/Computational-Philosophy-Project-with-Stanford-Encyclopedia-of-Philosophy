    "main_text": "Political Philosophy\n7. Political Philosophy\n\nDewey\u2019s political philosophy, like other areas, presumes that\nthat individuals subsist transactionally with their social\nenvironment, and can use inquiry to solve problems in hypothetical and\nexperimental\n ways.[44]\n As elsewhere, theory is instrumental; concepts and systems are tools\ninitially devised to function in particular, practical circumstances.\nWhile those proving valuable can be retained for reuse, all are\nconsidered fallible and capable of reconstruction. Dewey rejected\napproaches relying upon non-empirical, a priori assumptions\n(e.g., about human nature, historical progress, etc.) or which propose\nultimate, often monocausal, explanations. Dewey criticized and\nreconstructed core political concepts (individual, freedom, right,\ncommunity, public, state, and democracy) along naturalist and\nexperimentalist lines; besides numerous articles (for academic and lay\naudiences), Dewey\u2019s political thought can be found in books such\nas The Public and Its Problems (1927b, LW2),\nIndividualism, Old and New (1930f, LW5), Liberalism and\nSocial Action (1935, LW11), and Freedom and Culture\n(1939d, LW13). Because Democracy and Education (1916b,\nDE, MW9) emphasizes profound connections between education,\nsociety, and democratic habits\u2014it also merits study as a\n\u201cpolitical\u201d work.\n\nEnormous changes took place during Dewey\u2019s lifetime, including\nmassive US population growth, the rise of industrial, scientific,\ntechnological, and educational institutions, the American Civil War\nand two world wars, and a global economic depression. These events\nstrained prevailing liberal theories, and Dewey labored to revise both\ndemocracy and liberalism. \u201cThe frontier is moral, not\nphysical\u201d, Dewey urged, proposing that democracy was tantamount\nto a \u201cway of life\u201d, and required continual renewal to\n survive.[45]\n Beyond governmental machinery (universal suffrage, recurring\nelections, political parties, trial by peers, etc.), democracy was\n\u201cprimarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated\nexperience\u201d (DE, MW9: 93; see also, PP, LW2:\n325). Such experience, expressed as collaborative inquiry, required\nthe intellectual and emotional competencies necessary to tackle shared\nproblems and negotiate value differences. Ultimately, democracy\nrequires faith in experience as a sufficient resource for future\nsolutions and that it is no longer necessary to place faith into\ntranscendent rules or\n aims.[46]\n\nDewey\u2019s analysis of individualism grew both from earlier\nacademic interests and from his sensitivity to contemporary economic\nand technological\n pressures.[47]\n The older \u201catomic\u201d individualism\u2014where natural\negoists vie to maximize their standing\u2014was now harming not\nprotecting individuals; such individualism, deployed as a rhetorical\npretext, was enabling the wealthy and powerful to undermine (for most)\nthe protections which justified liberalism,\n initially![48]\n\nDewey\u2019s counter-proposal was \u201crenascent\n liberalism\u201d.[49]\n By reconstructing its core concept (\u201catomic\u201d individuals\nbecome \u201csocial\u201d), Dewey also revised other key political\nnotions\u2014e.g., \u201cliberty\u201d, \u201cfreedom\u201d, and\n\u201crights\u201d,\u2014and placed them in an instrumentalist\nframework (LSA, LW11: 35; E, MW5:\n 394).[50]\n Also revised are concomitant notions of \u201ccommunity\u201d and\n\u201cpublic\u201d. The Deweyan \u201cpublic\u201d forms around\nproblems; the aim is to conduct experimental inquiry and act for\nredress (PP, LW2: 314). Dewey also expressed a grave concern,\nstill with us today, regarding \u201cinchoate\u201d publics. Such\npublics consist of members lacking the critical education, time, and\nattention necessary for inquiry. They present democracy with perhaps\nits most significant and undermining condition (PP, LW2: 321,\n317).\n\nFor further details on Dewey\u2019s political theory, see the entry\non\n Dewey\u2019s political philosophy\n by M.
