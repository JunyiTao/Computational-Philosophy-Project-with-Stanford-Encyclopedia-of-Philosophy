    "main_text": "Justification || Justificatory Conditions\n3.2 Justificatory Conditions\n\nGiven the assumption that people have a moral duty to obey the law and\nthe concern that civil disobedience has the potential to destabilize\nsociety, Rawls famously raised the bar for the justified use of the\npractice, requiring acts of civil disobedience 1) to target serious\nand long-standing injustice and at the same time appeal to widely\naccepted principles of justice, 2) to be undertaken as a last resort,\nand 3) to be done in coordination with other minority groups with\nsimilar grievances (Rawls 1999, 326\u20139). These conditions for the\njustification of civil disobedience, which are critically examined in\nthis part, are closely tied not only to the ostensible need to diffuse\nits destabilizing potential and discourage proliferation of the\npractice, but also to the efficacy and role of civil disobedience in\nsociety (which is explored further in 3.3).\n\nLongstanding Injustice: Why did Rawls restrict the target of\ncivil disobedience to entrenched, longstanding injustices \u2013 in\nparticular, violations of the principle of equal basic liberties? For\nRawls, civil disobedience\u2019s chance of success rests on the\nclarity of the injustice: everyone must be able to recognize the\nviolation as an injustice, given widely accepted principles of\npolitical morality. Racial segregation fell in this category,\naccording to Rawls, but not economic inequality. Rawls thinks that\nappeals to publicly shared principles of constitutional morality (per\nthe publicity-as-appeal requirement) are more likely to persuade the\nmajority and succeed to bring about reform. Rawls, Ju\u0308rgen\nHabermas, and Ronald Dworkin restrict both civil disobedients\u2019\nappeals and their possible targets: they exclude matters of policy, as\nwell as injustices that do not consist of incontrovertible violations\nof widely accepted principles of justice.\n\nCritics reject this justificatory condition because it arbitrarily\nexcludes both progressive but not widely shared conceptions of justice\n(such as cosmopolitanism) and appeals to other principles of morality\nbesides justice (say, regarding the ethical treatment of animals;\nSinger 1973, 86\u201392). And whereas Dworkin (1985, 111\u20132)\nfinds anti-nuclear protest unjustifiable to the extent that it turns\non judgments of policy instead of appealing to fundamental principles\nof political morality, Robert Goodin (1987) counters that the\njustice/policy distinction is flimsy and arbitrarily drawn and insists\nthat civil disobedients should pursue the common good by protesting\ninternational and climate policies. Scholars also include in the class\nof justifiable targets private agents such as trade unions, banks,\nhealth insurance companies, labs, farm factories, and private\nuniversities (Walzer 1982, ch.2; Smith 2013, 55\u20136; Milligan\n2013, ch. 11\u201312; S. Cooke 2016). Finally, observation of past\nand present social movements, including the Abolitionist movement,\n#MeToo, and Black Lives Matter, suggests that, rather than appealing\nto the public principles of political morality, civil disobedients may\nin fact seek to transform common sense morality.\n\nLast Resort: What grounds the widely accepted requirement\nthat civil disobedience be undertaken as a last resort? How do we know\nagents have met it? One position is that, in a liberal democracy,\ncitizens should use proper legal channels of political participation\nto express their grievances (Raz 1979; though Raz grants that\nindividual acts of disobedience can be justified in liberal regimes).\nBut, since causes defended by a minority are often those most opposed\nby persons in power, legal channels may be less than wholly effective\n(Rawls 1999, 327). Moreover, it is unclear when a person could claim\nto have reached a situation of last resort; she could continue to use\nthe same tired legal methods without end. To ward off such challenges,\nRawls suggests that, if past actions, including by others, have shown\nthe majority to be immovable or apathetic, then further attempts may\nreasonably be thought fruitless and the dissenter may be confident her\ncivil disobedience is a last resort (1999, 328).\n\nMinority Group Coordination: The coordination requirement is\ndesigned to regulate the overall level of dissent (Rawls 1999, 327).\nThe idea is that since minority groups are equally justified in\nresorting to civil disobedience when they have sufficiently weighty\nobjections, these groups should avoid undermining each other\u2019s\nefforts through simultaneous appeals to the attention of society and\ngovernment. While there is some merit to this condition, arguably\ncivil disobedience that does not meet it can still be justifiable. In\nsome cases, there will be no time or opportunity to coordinate with\nother minorities. In other cases, other minority groups may be unable\nor unwilling to coordinate. The refusal or inability of other groups\nto cooperate should arguably not affect the ultimate defensibility of\na person\u2019s or group\u2019s use of civil disobedience.\n\nA reason for Rawls to defend this coordination requirement is that\noften coordination serves a more important concern, namely, the\nachievement of good consequences. It is often argued that civil\ndisobedience can only be justified if there is a high probability that\nit will produce positive change, since only such change can justify\nexposing society to the risks of harm usually associated with civil\ndisobedience \u2013 namely, its destabilizing and divisive potential\nand the risk that it could encourage lawbreaking or escalate into\nuncivil disobedience. In response to these challenges, one might\nquestion the empirical claims that civil disobedience is divisive and\nthat it has the consequence of leading others to use disobedience to\nachieve changes in policy. One might also question whether it\nnecessarily would be a bad thing if civil disobedience had these\nconsequences. Concerning likelihood of success, civil disobedience can\nseem most justifiable when the situation appears hopeless and when the\ngovernment refuses to listen to conventional forms of communication.\nAdditionally, even when general success seems unlikely, civil\ndisobedience might be defended for any reprieve from harm that it\nbrings to victims of a bad law or policy. Tree-hugging, for example,\ncan delay or curtail a clear-cut logging scheme and thereby prolong\nthe protection of an ecosystem.\n",
