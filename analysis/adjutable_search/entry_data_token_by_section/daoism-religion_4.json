The officiant who takes\ncharge of these phenomena is the wu, a term that denotes a\nmale or female medium or healer but is often translated as\n\u201cshaman\u201d. The wu is capable of dealing with the\nrealm of demonic creatures and administers proper remedies\u2014for\nexample, protective talismans (fu) and herbal\nmedicines\u2014to those affected by such creatures. While these and\nanalogous practices have continued to exist throughout the history of\nDaoism, it should be noted that the typical shamanic\n\u201ctrance\u201d has never been part of Daoist practices.\n",
