    "main_text": "Causality and Probability || Views Prior to The Theory of Probability\n2.2 Views Prior to The Theory of Probability\n\nReichenbach\u2019s allegiance to Kantian formulations waxed and waned\nand transformed over time, but while the terminology changed,\nReichenbach long retained the essential claim of his doctoral thesis\nthat the establishment of any empirical law requires a superempirical\npresupposition about probability. In 1920, the argument and\nconclusions of the thesis were repeated with little qualification or\nvariation in two essays, \u201cThe Physical Presuppositions of the\nCalculus of Probability\u201d, and \u201cA Philosophical Critique of\nthe Probability Calculus\u201d. Again in \u201cCausality and\nProbability\u201d, in 1930, Reichenbach reprises the claims of his\ndoctoral thesis, but substitutes the \u201cprinciple of\ninduction\u201d\u2014that observed frequencies will continue to hold\nin new cases\u2014for the \u201cprinciple of probability.\u201d The\nprinciple of induction is not given an explicitly a priori basis, the\npossibility of which Reichenbach had come to doubt when studying with\nEinstein (see Reichenbach, 1920f). Instead, it is justified by an\nuneasy mixture of loose convergence arguments (foreshadowing the\nstraight rule, see below) and psychological habit. Without\nattribution, he dismisses a \u201cconventionalist\u201d account of\nthe principle of induction, expressed in nearly Kantian terms, as\n\u201cthe principle of induction is not a statement about the\nphysical world, but merely constitutes an ordering principle of\nscience.\u201d He argues that such an account does not\n\u201cjustify\u201d scientific preferences for simpler hypotheses\n(1930g, see Reichenbach 1978, vol. II, p. 340\u2013341). Arbitrary\nconvention could choose any scientific hypothesis that captures the\nphenomena, but a descriptively accurate account of theory selection in\nscience must explain why simpler theories should be preferred. The\njustification of the preference for simpler hypotheses remains\nunexplained in \u201cCausality and Probability\u201d, and\nReichenbach\u2019s own conclusion seems to be essentially the Kantian\nprinciple he rejects, supplemented with an attempt to prove that the\nprinciple of induction is unchallengeable because, in his view,\nprobability claims are generalizations over as yet unobserved cases\nand therefore presuppose the principle of induction: \n\nWe found that a probability statement is meaningful only if the\nprinciple of induction holds; therefore the statement that the\nprobability laws do not hold is itself meaningless unless the\nprinciple of induction holds. To say that probability laws do not hold\nis equivalent to predicting that the observed relative frequency of\nsequences of events will not be preserved in the future, that the\nregularity implied by the principle of induction does not\nhold\u2014and this statement has empirical meaning only if it can be\ndecided inductively, i.e., if the principle of induction holds. The\nstatement that probability laws do not hold is self-contradictory and\nmakes no sense. (1978, vol. II, p. 343)\n\n\nIn a further break with the Kantian tradition, the role of causation\nas conceptually primitive is reconsidered. It is difficult to pinpoint\nReichenbach\u2019s position between 1915 and 1935 since his writings\nmix epistemic and metaphysical issues. In his thesis (1915b) and in\n\u201cStetige Wahrscheinlichkeitsfolgen\u201d (1929L) Reichenbach is\ncommitted to individual deterministic causal events. In \u201cThe\nCausal Structure of the World\u201d (1925d) probability is regarded\nas the more fundamental concept. In later years Reichenbach often\ncited this paper as an anticipation of the indeterminism of quantum\ntheory, because his account allows the possibility that finer and\nfiner measures will not converge to deterministic laws (see Gerner,\n1997, p. 153). In \u201cCausality and Probability\u201d (1930g)\ncausality explicitly refers to regularities in populations rather than\nto particular events, a view whose source Reichenbach attributes to\nLudwig Boltzmann\u2019s development of the theory of gases. The\nseparation of causality and probability, and the recasting of\ncausality as a higher level concept, required that Reichenbach find a\nnew foundation for probability. Presumably due to the influence of his\ncolleague Richard von Mises, Reichenbach moved towards a view of\nprobability as a property of sequences. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s 1925 essay \u201cThe Causal Structure of the\nWorld\u201d (1925d) is also an early attempt to account for the\ndirection of time in terms of causal and probabilistic asymmetries.\nReichenbach there introduces the notion of a \u201cprobability\nimplication\u201d with 10 axiom schemes on propositional variables\ninvolving both material implication and a new 2-place probability\nimplication connective. The axioms are evidently meant to supplement\nthose of propositional logic. No rules of inference are specified, but\nsubstitution and modus ponens are used. The axioms do not guarantee\nthat a probability implication, a \u2287\n b[2],\n is the conditional probability of b given a, or\neven that the consequents of a collection of probability implications\nwith a as antecedent satisfy the axioms of finite\nprobability. Interpretation is difficult, since Reichenbach both\nasserts that the probability of the consequent in a probability\nimplication can be between 0 and 1 inclusive (1925d, 1978, vol. II, p.\n89), but then disallows a probability implication because the\nconsequent has probability 0 (p. 92). Reichenbach\u2019s thought\nseems to be that a \u2287 b asserts that in\ncircumstance a, b has a well defined probability,\nthat is, a specifies something like what Ian Hacking (1965)\nlater called a \u201cchance setup,\u201d or as Reichenbach might\nhave put it, implies the existence of a probability function for\n{b, ~b}. Reichenbach uses the operation very much in\nthat way in his 1925 discussion of the direction of time, which he\nthinks can be founded on cases in which a \u2287 b\nis true but b \u2287 a is false. Even under this\nreading some of his axiom schemes have false instances, e.g.,\n(a \u2287 b) \u2283 (a.c \u2287\nb), where the dot is ordinary conjunction. (The claim that\nb has a probability distribution in context a does\nnot necessarily imply that b has a probability distribution\nin context a conjoined with context c, since\nc might make a distribution impossible.) Revised, probability\nimplication later became a foundational notion of Reichenbach\u2019s\ntheory of probability and the central concept of his approach to\ninductive logic. \n\nFurther Reading. For Reichenbach\u2019s views on causality\nsee also the discussion of\n \u201cThe Direction of Time\u201d\n below and the separate entry on Reichenbach\u2019s\n Common Cause Principle.\n \n",
