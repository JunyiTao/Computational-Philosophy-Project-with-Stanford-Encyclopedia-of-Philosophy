His\nsignificance in early modern thought has in recent years been\nrediscovered and explored, towards a better understanding of the dawn\nof modern empiricism, the mechanical philosophy, and relations of\nmodern philosophy to ancient and medieval discussions. While Gassendi\nis perhaps best known in history of philosophy for his disputes with\nDescartes, his relations with other major figures, including Kepler,\nGalileo, Mersenne, Beeckman, and Hobbes, represented even more\nimportant transactions of ideas. And while Gassendi also sought to\ncommunicate anew the ideas of Epicurus, the Stoics, and other earlier\nthinkers, his resulting amalgam of perspectives provides a modern view\nof his own making, one of the touchstones of philosophy and science in\nhis times: our access to knowledge of the natural world is dependent\non the constraints and licenses that follow from our epistemic grasp\nbeing limited to information provided by senses.  Through this\narch-empiricism\u2014tempered by his priestly adherence to key\nelements of Church doctrine\u2014Gassendi views metaphysics as a\nrealm for speculation grounded in the possibility of empirical\nconfirmation, logic as (by turns) a psychologistic and probabilistic\nenterprise, knowledge of the external world as built on and forever\nsubject to sensory-based evidence, and ethics in quasi-hedonist,\npossibly quantifiable terms. Gassendi's philosophy is a constant\nreview of other sources, a thorough consideration of the landscape\ninto which his own empiricism fits and represents an alternative to\ncontrasting claims, past and present. What is sometimes thought of as\neclecticism\u2014particularly in the posthumous masterwork, the\nSyntagma Philosophicum\u2014actually recasts philosophy as a\nfully-referenced scholarly enterprise, advancing historical styles and\nrhetorical modes in philosophical research and exposition. In these\nchanges he matches even the magnitude of innovation that marks his\natomist matter theory, empiricist perspectives, explorations and\ndefenses of the new physics, objections to the Meditations,\nand refutations of contemporary Aristotelians and mystical\nthinkers. It has been argued\u2014perhaps unfairly\u2014that\nGassendi's core ideas are better preserved through the medium of\nwritings by Boyle, Locke, Huygens, and Newton. Yet his presentation of\nan empiricism, atomism, and new cosmology in historical and\nphilosophical context greatly advanced the community of scholarship in\nhis day, and represents what was then a fairly new model of research\nand exposition\u2014still in philosophical use today.\n", "toc": [{"#1": "1.

Historical Background and Gassendi's Life\n\n\nBorn in 1592 to a family of commoners in the tranquil Haute-Provence\ntown of Champtercier, Pierre Gassendi rose to become the greatest\nProven\u00e7al scholar of his day, a member of the preeminent French\nintellectual group of his times\u2014the Mersenne circle\u2014and\nprofessor of mathematics at the College Royal. At an early age, his\ninstructors recognized great potential, and dispatched him at age\nsixteen to Aix-en-Provence for studies of further sophistication than\nhis local schooling could provide. In these first years of scholarly\npursuit, Gassendi shuttled between Aix and Digne (the provincial\ncapital) and so began a life-long pattern of itinerant travel. His\nextensive and early education vaulted him to professorship at Aix\nwhile still in his mid-twenties. He shuttled between careers as well,\nattaining success and station not only in academic circles but also in\nthe Catholic Church.\n\n\nGassendi's career as a priest is a crucial facet of his intellectual\nconstitution: his writings reflect an unbending allegiance to Holy\nScripture and Church teachings, though not necessarily in orthodox\ndoctrinal lights. He was ordained at the age of 24 or 25 and, while\nthere is no question of the strength of his faith, one motivation for\nhis career in the Church appears to be its provision of a sinecure.\nThus Gassendi started at the rank of a low-level local official\n(Chanoine of the Cathedral) in Digne and rose to the rank of a\nslightly higher-level local official (Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t), still in\nDigne, some twenty years later. Though he clearly pursued a studied\nrelationship with his higher authority, all the while he wrote letters\nof support to the Church-embattled Galileo, sought appointment to the\nsecular College Royal, and cultivated deep personal and intellectual\nties with his non-Church patrons\u2014the affluent\nfonctionnaire, Francois Luillier; the Proven\u00e7al\nsavant, Nicole-Pierre Fabri de Peiresc; the local count of Alais,\nLouis Emmanuel de Valois; and the Parisian noble, Habert de\nMontmor.\n\n\nAfter some years of instructing pupils in philosophy and theology,\nGassendi distanced himself from what he believed to be rigid teachings\nof the Scholastics in his Exercitationes Paradoxicae of 1624.\nThereafter he began a formative partnership in physiological,\nastronomical, and historical studies with the wise and wealthy\nPeiresc, summarized in Gassendi's glowing biography written upon\nPeiresc's death in 1637. By this time, Gassendi had also developed his\nearly interests in a variety of questions in basic physics and in\nrestoring the philosophy of Epicurus\u2014much as Thomas had restored\nAristotle, integrating his thought with what he held to be\ntheologically viable. His published work in philosophy and natural\nphilosophy captured the attention of the Minim priest, Marin\nMersenne. Gassendi spent the last two decades of his life traveling\nback and forth between Provence and Paris because of varying\ncommitments to patrons, appointment to the College Royal, and\nill health. Throughout, he remained informed of and involved with\nscholarly discussions of the day, owing to his engagement with the\ngroup of philosophers and scientists united through correspondence\nwith Mersenne. In the Mersenne circle, debates ranged over numerous\ntopics central to the dismantling of Aristotelian and Scholastic\nworld-views, and Mersenne often used his role as facilitator to bring\ntogether opponents on these issues. In that context, Mersenne helped\nenable the entry of Gassendi's criticisms of Descartes's\nMeditations into the Objections and Replies\n(Gassendi subsequently published his rebuttals in his Disquistio\nMetaphysica of 1646) and focused Gassendi's attention on refuting\nthe mystical attacks on Kepler by Robert Fludd (Epistolica\nExercitatio, in qua principia philosophiae Roberti Fluddi medici\nreteguntur, 1630). Members of this circle regularly reported on\neach other's experiments and proposed new challenges, such as\nPoysson's well-known puzzling over whether physical indivisibles could\nor should be identified with mathematical points. Gassendi used this\nforum to learn about other empirical studies as well as to work out a\ngood many of his views.\n\n\nHis scientific career was varied and complex, if never quite\nassociated with glowing triumph. Some historians consider his greatest\naccomplishment in this sphere to be his contribution to the revival of\nancient atomism but this represents only one end of his\nanti-Aristotelian physics, and a small, albeit core element of his\nscientific interests. His other accomplishments in physics includes a\nstudy of bodies in free fall (closely modeled on Galileo's work), a\nmature enunciation of the principle of inertia, and an early and\nreasonably accurate interpretation of the Pascalian barometry\nexperiments of the late 1640s. Gassendi also ventured into\nexperimental science: he attempted to measure the speed of sound by\ncannon fire, arranged to have weights dropped from the mast of a\nmoving ship to enact Galileo's thought experiment (and so dispel\ndoubts about the motion of the Earth), and conducted numerous chemical\ntrials involving, among other things, the dissolution of salts and\nformation of crystals (which he took to bolster his molecular theory\nof matter).  These are only some of his better-known exploits. In\naddition, he offered a wide variety of speculations on the earth\nsciences based partly on geological fieldwork and biological and\nphysiological observations\u2014and as shaped by his atomist\nhypothesis. Finally, Gassendi devoted much of his time to astronomical\npursuits. He made regular observations of the skies for decades,\nproducing confirmatory evidence for Kepler's views, observing\nsunspots, the anses of Saturn, and the passage of Mercury before the\nSun (1631), and successfully predicting an eclipse in 1654. Moreover,\nhe commissioned the first map of the moon, defended the Copernican\nview as plausible save for its conflicts with Church teachings, and\noffered many disparaging words on what he considered the scurrilous\nand empirically intolerable practice of astrology.\n\n\nIn his final years, Gassendi relented to pressure from friends and\nreleased a major portion of his Epicurean studies to the public,\npublishing his Latin translation of Diogenes Laertiius's Book X on\nEpicurus, along with ample commentary, in his Animadversiones\nof 1649. He continued to work on this interpretive material, however,\nsteadily incorporating philosophical and scientific insights, until\nhis death in the Paris apartment of Montmor in 1655. Montmor, acting\nas executor, collected this material in manuscript form and with\nGassendi's other Parisian friends arranged to have it published as the\nposthumous Syntagma Philosophicum. The Syntagma is\nmore systematic than the Animadversiones, largely eschewing\nthe sometimes philological character of the earlier commentary and\nprincipally discussing logic, the natural sciences, psychology, and\nethics from the perspective of what Gassendi deems philosophically,\nhistorically, and theologically supportable. His interests in Epicurus\nare ever-present, not least in the structure of the work, which is\ndivided into a Logic (including his textbook-format Institutio\nLogica), Physics, and Ethics.  Happily, we have a rather\nwell-rounded picture of Gassendi's intellectual pursuits, on top of\nhis Epicurean projects. Montmor and company had the good sense to\nbundle the Syntagma together with the better part of\nGassendi's other writings (the Animadversiones notably\nexcepted) in six volumes of collected works, the Opera Omnia\n(Lyon, 1658; Florence, 1727), which includes as well earlier letters\non optics and the free fall of bodies, a portion of his voluminous\nastronomical observations, and a great deal of his correspondence.\n(In what follows, we cite passages in Opera Omnia by using\nthe following abbreviations for the volumes: \"O I\", \"O II\",\u2026,\n\"O VI\".)\n\n\n\nIn the wake of Gassendi's death, his general renown, influence on\nFrench schooling and popular conceptions of natural science, and\nrivalry for Descartes' legacy, all grew. This impact was enhanced by\nthe 1674-1675 publication of a condensed, abridged, reorganized, and\noccasionally paraphrased version of the Opera Omnia, written\nin French by Gassendi's acolyte, Fran\u00e7ois Bernier. Over the\nfollowing half century, the \u201cGassendistes\u201d stood as\nformidable opponents to the \u201cCart\u00e9siennes\u201d in\nFrench debates over educational and scientific matters, and Gassendi's\nthinking spread\u2014variously influencing Leibniz, Boyle, Locke, and\nNewton, among others.\n2. Method and Nature of Philosophical Inquiry\n\n\nCommentators and historians conventionally designate Gassendi as an\nearly modern thinker yet there is good reason to at least consider his\nwork as belonging to the tail end of the preceding period. One facet\nof his work that closely resembles Renaissance philosophy and science\nis the historical focus of his method of inquiry. For almost every\nphilosophical issue Gassendi deems worthy of discussion, he first\nintroduces a wide range of previous competing views, beginning with\nthe antique schools, which he considers as \u2018live\u2019\noptions. He engages with Aristotle and early (as well as late)\nAristotelianism, and allows great debts to Skeptic, Stoic, and\nEpicurean thought. The history of philosophy is for him a source of\nvitally important reasoning, the generally correct way to frame our\nquestions, and more occasionally, the answers to those questions. Thus\none principal attraction of atomism for Gassendi is that it suggests a\nway to think about causation among material objects which he finds an\nattractive alternative to Aristotelian views on one hand and\nnon-physicalist views on the other. In his theory of knowledge we find\none more instance of using ancient frameworks to model contemporary\nproblems: no criterion of truth, for example, is adequate unless it\nsatisfies the standard points made by the classical Skeptics. Some may\nsee this as evidence of Gassendi's modernism, but his broad concerns\nwith Skeptical thought certainly place him among good Renaissance\ncompany. (The Skepticist and anti-Aristotelian strains of his\nExercitationes are also thought to be influenced by his reading of\nnear-contemporaries, including Juan Luis Vives and Pierre\nCharron.)\n\n\nAnother Renaissance-type element of Gassendi's writings is his\nstylistic obsession with antiquity. His Latin is learned if a bit\nstultified, rife with quotations from Virgil, Horace, Cicero,\nTertullian, and others. An embroidered, ornate quality marks his few\nextant French writings, too. He quotes frequently and liberally from\nclassical sources, usually in Latin though sometimes in Greek, and his\ntranslation of Diogenes Laertius's Book X on the life of Epicurus is\nthe centerpiece of his 1649 Animadversiones. Gassendi does\nnot, as does Descartes, suggest his work is so modern as to have been\ninvented de novo. Rather, he constantly refers the reader to\na wide variety of other, generally classical writers as sources of\nboth like-minded and conflicting perspectives. Finally, the single\nmost time-consuming project of his career consists in his prodigious\nefforts towards reviving the works and reputation of one particular\nclassical figure, Epicurus.\n\n\nThese Renaissance trappings notwithstanding, there are also at least\ntwo reasons to think of Gassendi as very much among the moderns. For\none, he embraces the new empiricist's assessment of the old science:\nwhat is wrong with the Aristotelians' physics is its routine\npresentation, as well as grounding, in apriori theoretical\nclaims. He is not the only, or the first author of such a\nview. Galileo breaks with tradition in distinguishing a science of\nmotion that, in principle at least, makes use of observation and\nexperiment. Bacon and Descartes, for their part, also counsel (to\nvarying degrees) a scientific method which builds on experiential\nknowledge. But among the savants of the early seventeenth\ncentury, only Gassendi, whose awareness of empiricism's roots and\nimplications is evident across his intellectual pursuits, integrates\nphilosophy and science on what he believes to be strictly empiricist\ngrounds. This integration is a natural consequence of his suggestion\nthat we gain all knowledge\u2014outside of the theological\u2014from\nthe senses.\n\n\nA range of equally modern views follow from his proposed empiricist\nfoundations for the new science and its methods. He suggests a\nprobabilist notion of what counts as warranted empirical belief, and\ninsists that we may license beliefs about the sub- and\nsupra-perceivable but only if they are well-grounded in our beliefs\nabout the perceptually given. Further, he devises rules for accepting\nor rejecting hypotheses, and guidelines for directing empirical\ndiscoveries and our judgments of the same, where all such claims are\nsubject to the test of evidence from experiment or observation. It is\nfar from true that all, or even most, of his own claims about the\nnature of the physical world meet this test, but the modernity of\nGassendi's philosophy and science lies in his proposal that this is a\ngoal to be set, altogether.\n3. Refutations of Aristotelians and Descartes\n\n\nFor many commentators, Gassendi's empiricist theory of knowledge and\nobjections to Descartes's Meditations count as his paramount\nphilosophical contributions. In his core epistemology, he offers the\nfirst modern model of knowledge from the senses to be integrated with\na physiological account of perception. In his objections to Descartes,\nhe rejects the clarity and distinctness criterion, seeks to undermine\nthe reasoning behind the cogito, and assails the ontological\nargument. Each of these views represents a battle Gassendi has taken\nup against the Aristotelian tradition or the Cartesian stance; his\nthoroughgoing empiricism poses an alternative to both of these\ncompeting perspectives.\n\n\nOne cornerstone of Gassendi's anti-Aristotelianism is the suggestion\nthat there is nothing necessary about the way the world is.  God, he\nproposes, could have made the world work in any number of ways, and\nthe contingent history and character of Creation means that there is\nnothing immutable about the essence of a material thing. (That a\n\u2018substance\u2019, in either the Aristotelian or Cartesian\nsense, might have an immutable essence, is a different matter, and\ninsofar as Gassendi has such a notion (for example, with respect to\nspace, time, matter, and void) he agrees that such things feature\nunchangeable sine qua non characteristics.) Moreover,\nGassendi maintains, regardless of whether there are any essences and\nwhether they might be mutable, there are none to which we have any\nepistemic access. The sole originating source of our knowledge is the\ninformation the senses provide, such that what we know is closely\nlinked to what we can perceive. However, as Descartes notes, we can\nperceive only appearances. Gassendi draws from this point the very\nuncartesian lesson that appearances are all we can know about,\ntoo\u2014thereby ruling out knowledge of unperceivable essences. One\nline of this reasoning can be found in his discussion of classical\nskeptical tropes concerning the relativity of evidence from the senses\nto individual experience\u2014that honey tastes sweet to me, though\nbitter to you; and that fire seems hot to us, though not so to insects\nthat live near fire (O III (DM) 388b; R 535). Since different\npeople have distinct experiences, our knowledge of honey's taste or\nfire's heat differs from person to person and thus is not a reliable\nguide to invariable characteristics of, for example, the honey or\nfire. In cases like these we know a thing's qualities only as we\nrecord them on a subjective basis. Such sensory information, based on\nexperiences which vary intersubjectively, cannot yield judgments about\na thing's qualities which do not vary in that (or any other)\nway. Hence we lack knowledge of the thing's essence, if indeed there\nis one. More broadly, from our principal source of ideas\u2014the\nsenses\u2014we know only how things appear to us (O III (DM)\n311b-312a; R 184). (If we are to have knowledge of an object's\nessence, Gassendi proposes, such requires a \u201cperfect interior\nexamination\u201d of that object, which is apparently not something\nwe may gain from empirical study.)\n\n\nGassendi also contests the Aristotelian view that we can know\nuniversals, on the grounds that we cannot perceive anything more than\nparticulars in the world (O III (Exercitationes) 159a; EP\n280-281). It follows, he suggests, that neither can there be any\nuniversals we know about, at least with anything like certainty. Some\ncommentators (including Bloch, Rochot, and Osler) propose that\nnominalism is a central Gassendist view, on the basis of this\nrejection of essences and universals, as well as his epistemic\nreliance on the apparent, and interest in signs and their conventional\ncharacter. But Gassendi's nominalism\u2014if it be such, in the\northodox sense\u2014is intended less as an ontological assessment,\nthan as a statement of the limits of human mental capacity, whether\nepistemic or linguistic.\n\n\nFurther building on the insistence that all knowledge comes from the\nsenses, Gassendi discusses the view (shared as well by Descartes and\nthe Aristotelians) that there are propositions we can know with\ncertainty. Since all propositions are judged as true or false on an\nempirical basis, none can be deemed indubitable, save those of\ntheology and theologically-derived cosmology. This lack of certainty\nextends as well to logical demonstration, whether of inductive or\ndeductive character. Nothing is certain about such demonstration,\nGassendi suggests, save the limits imposed upon it by the frailty of\nhuman intellectual capacities. The natural bounds of our epistemic\ngrasp in the physical sciences, astronomy, or most any other field of\nstudy is just what the senses tell us, plus any correctives reason\nsupplies on the basis of sensory-based knowledge we have already\naccrued.\n\n\nThat Gassendi thinks there is a need for correctives on sensory\ninformation makes clear the depths of his rejection of epistemic\nfoundationalism in Aristotelian or Cartesian thought: we cannot trust\neven information from the senses to give us a failsafe picture of the\nworld. In this he embraces the Skeptical judgment that no source of\nbelief can provide for certain knowledge. Yet he cannot accept their\nwholesale dismissal of sensory-derived evidence for belief. Knowledge\nfrom the senses is possible just in case we have warrant for judgments\nabout appearances, though we may lack warrant for certainty about\nthose judgments. To the limited extent that we have the second sort of\nwarrant, he suggests, we find this in the reliability of our sensory\napparatuses (as he describes in his Epicurean-inspired account of\nperception). We see here a \u2018constructive skepticist\u2019\nresponse to the Skeptics who say no knowledge is possible and to those\nancient and latter-day \u2018dogmatic\u2019 thinkers (including, in\nhis view, the Aristotelians and Descartes) who say knowledge involves\nthe attainment of certain belief\u2014and is readily\nattainable. While it may not be possible to have certain beliefs, it\nis quite possible to have knowledge given that we construe it as\njustified but less-than-certain belief. (Naturally, it must have a\nveridical character as well, and Gassendi thinks it sufficient that\nsuch beliefs are at least truth-resembling.)\n\n\nGassendi articulates such disagreements with Descartes in the\nObjections, where he also rejects the Cartesian criterion of clarity\nand distinctness, as either a standard for judging ideas or source of\nepistemic warrant. As regards the former, Gassendi points out that\nreason, which comprises our intellectual judgments and interpretations\nof sensory information, is itself prone to error:\n\n\n\u2026although deception, or falsity, is not to be found in the\nsenses themselves, which merely behave passively and only report\nthings as they appear and as they must appear given their causes, it\nis to be found in the judgment, or mind, when it does not act with\nenough circumspection and does not perceive that things which are\ndistant\u2026appear more indistinct and smaller than they do close\nup\u2026.  (O III (DM) 388a; R 532; B 266-267)\n\n\n\n\nIf, for all their faults, claims based on sensory information are more\nreliable than those based on reasoning (about sensory information or\nanything else), then we ought not appeal to the latter as a basis for\njudging among claims of the former. One reason he thinks sensory-based\nclaims are the more reliable of the two is that he takes the senses to\npassively (hence steadily) collect information, in contrast to our\nmental judgment actively (hence irregularly) organizing or relating\ninformation. This is not to say that we will have no problems gauging\nthe warrant for claims based on sensory information as we collect\nit. Rather, we will have even more problems in gauging claims based on\nideas about sensory information after such ideas are that much more\nremoved from a direct and perspicuous relationship to the world as\nexperienced, in our organizing and relating them to other ideas.\n\n\nMoreover, the Cartesian criterion is irrelevant to judging cases of\nempirical knowledge, Gassendi suggests\u2014and even if this\ncriterion were not irrelevant, Descartes's own claims to knowledge\nshould fail all the same. First, in the case of empirical knowledge,\nGassendi proposes that the Cartesian criterion fails on classical\nSkeptical grounds: it is possible for us to have ideas from the senses\nwe take to be clear and distinct which are nevertheless not the basis\nfor warranted claims to empirical knowledge of a general\nnature. Though we may have clear and distinct ideas about the\nappearances of, for example, the color of the sky we perceive, we\ncannot infer from this clarity and distinctness that we know what\ncolor the sky is. As the Skeptics warn, the sky could appear to\ndifferent persons in different colors, and as Gassendi adds, our ideas\nof such an appearance could each be clear and distinct (O III\n(DM) 314b; R 198-199). Second, knowledge claims Descartes\ntakes to be demonstrated by reason alone Gassendi dismisses as anyway\nfailing the proposed criterion; they are partial and confused, he\nsuggests, because they lack the immediacy characteristic of judgments\nwe attain by strictly empirical means.  Whereas ideas we gain from the\nsenses directly represent worldly objects and events, ideas we attain\nby deductive proof are but hypothetical analogues to such\nsensory-derived ideas:\n\n\n\u2026it is not the same thing for us to conceive something by a\nveritable idea or a true image, and to conceive that thing by a\nconclusion that follows necessarily from an anterior hypothesis. In\nthe first case in effect we conceive of the thing as absolutely so; in\nthe second, that it should be some such thing; and also in the first\ncase we know the thing distinctly and as it is in itself, and in the\nsecond case we know it only in a confused manner and by analogy, that\nis, in referring to it as something that must be known by way of some\nidea (O III DM) 322b; R 234).\n\n\n\n\nIn brief, our reasoned claims are less than fully clear or distinct\nbecause we arrive at them through the mediation of ideas about our\nempirical knowledge. Hence Descartes's most cherished claims about\nessential properties of mind, God, and matter fail his own criterion\nfor lack of direct foundation in our ideas from the senses.\n\n\nNot all of Gassendi's criticisms of the Cartesian criterion are rooted\nin his advocacy of knowledge from the senses. Thus, he suggests, one\nother problem with that criterion is its failure to make good on its\nfoundationalist promise. Just in case some of our clear and distinct\nideas turn out to be wrong, we will require some further criterion to\ndistinguish them from the correct ideas. And if the new criterion is\nsimply something like \u2018more clear and more distinct\u2019, then\nwe are on the road to infinitely many higher-order criteria, which\ndefeats the aims of the foundationalist project altogether. Finally,\nGassendi offers what Descartes himself came to call \u201cthe\nobjection of objections.\u201d Our ideas being clear and distinct\nideas is perfectly consonant with a solipsistic perspective, but then\nthe only thing we can know with certainty is our own thoughts. Yet a\nviable criterion should (a) also distinguish our knowledge claims\nabout the external world, and (b) mark solipsistic claims as dubitable\nto begin with. On top of these objections, Gassendi proposes that\nDescartes has put the cart before the horse by suggesting we can\nreadily recognize what is clear and distinct and use this as a guide\nto what is indubitable when what we need in the first place is some\nguide as to what is clear and distinct:\n\n\n\u2026the difficulty is not, as it seems, to know if one must\nconceive things clearly and distinctly so as not to be mistaken at\nall, but to know by what way or method it is possible to recognize\nthat one has a conception so clear and so distinct that it is true and\nimpossible that we are mistaken. (O III (DM) 372b; R 458)\n\n\n\n\nAnother well-known set of Gassendi's objections target Descartes'\nviews of mind and body. One such objection is a prelude to the\nwell-known puzzle over how mind and body could be thought to interact,\nposed by Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia. Gassendi wonders how Descartes\ncould take the mind to be thinking substance lacking extension yet\nclaim that it is somehow attached to the body, given that anything\njoined to a body must itself be extended (O III (DM)\n399b-401a; R 584-590). Descartes's answer is that he does not take\nmind and body to be attached, which response immediately invites\nPrincess Elisabeth's puzzle.\n\n\nIn a related vein, Descartes's cogito reasoning also\nundergoes close scrutiny. Gassendi understands this reasoning as one\nperson's inference from his or her indubitable recognition of\ncognitive activity, to the claim that he or she exists as the selfsame\nseat of such activity. Against such an inference he points out that\nrecognition that one has a set of thoughts does not imply that one is\na particular thinker or another. Were we to move from the observation\nthat there is thinking occurring to the attribution of this thinking\nto a particular agent, we would simply assume what we set out to\nprove, namely, that there exists a particular person endowed with the\ncapacity for thought (O III (DM) 289a-290a; R\n82-86). Descartes is in dangerous waters at this point, for if indeed\nthe only claim that is indubitable here is the agent-independent claim\nthat there is cognitive activity present, then he can be fairly\nassociated with Averroist panpsychism, and its considerable taint. At\na minimum, the argument requires a significant leap of reasoning, and\nfor Gassendi, this is further evidence that Descartes places\naltogether too much faith in his criterion and the work he thinks it\ncan do.\n\n\nThat Gassendi is primarily concerned here with the character of\nDescartes's reasoning is plain enough: in the end and broadly\nspeaking, the two are actually close in their views about mind and\nbody. They are both dualists of one stripe or another, and the\nparticulars of Gassendi's physically-rooted psychology are reasonably\nsimilar to those of Descartes's model.  Gassendi's model of the mind\nis often taken to be wholly materialist in design, particularly as\nseen through the prism of his critique of Descartes. Yet only one\nfacet of the Gassendist soul is the material anima, the locus of\nphysically-determined pleasure and pain.  He also posits an immaterial\nanimus, the seat of the intellect or rational understanding. This\ncognitive faculty is the locus of spiritually-determined pleasures and\npains we associate with, for example, love of God or fear of\nevil. Here we have an echo of the Thomist interpretation of De Anima,\naccording to which vegetative and motive facets of the soul perish\nwith the body though an intellective facet lives on forever.\n\n\nElsewhere on a theological plane, Gassendi shares other core views\nwith Descartes, though some commentators have tried to paint Gassendi\nas concealing atheist tendencies, owing to his suspected materialist\nand libertine allegiances. Such a charge is inaccurate.  Yet it is\nalso so that Gassendi does not accept the Cartesian route to belief in\nthe Divine, notably rejecting Descartes' version of the ontological\nargument.\n\n\nThe Cartesian version of Anselm's traditional argument suggests that\nGod has the intrinsic property of existence as part of a divine\nessence, in the same way a triangle has intrinsic properties such as\nhaving three internal angles summing to 180 degrees. Further, as with\nall divinely-held properties, God has that existence property as a\nperfection\u2014that is, God exists in a perfect way, such that God\ncannot not exist. Gassendi rejects this reasoning on two grounds.\nFirst, we have no irrefutable intuitions of essences, whether such are\nsupposed to be represented by properties of triangles or of God.\nDescartes' particular misstep here is to suggest that we may move from\nthe definition of God (which we intuit as a clear and distinct notion)\nas essentially entailing the property of existence, to the view that\nthere is such a thing as God with said property. A definition of a\nthing as having such and such properties does not commit us to the\nthing existing with those properties, even if one of those properties\nis said to be existence. This much was noted in Gaunilo's early\ncriticism of Anselm's version. Yet the more general point Gassendi\nmakes is that no intuitions untested by sensory experience will yield\nknowledge of God's essence or anything else, as the primary mode of\nattaining knowledge (and that by which any intuitions must be tested)\nis empirical demonstration. Second, presaging the Kantian criticism,\nexistence is neither a perfection nor any sort of property or\npredicate of things that exist. Rather, existence is simply an aspect\nof things that exist, the mode or state of being that describes its\nexisting. Existence is accordingly a precondition for bearing\nperfections (and for perfections being borne by the thing), rather\nthan something which itself can be a perfection. If we refer to a\nthing's existence, we are only referring to a fact about the thing,\nthat it exists. Rejecting the ontological argument, then, eliminates a\nsort of conceptual confusion: although we might think of perfections\nexisting (in a thing), it is hard to conceive of what it would mean\nfor existence to exist (in a thing), or for that matter, to not\nexist. Along similar lines, there is no reason to accept the\nunderlying claim of the ontological argument that things which do not\nexist are either imperfect or lacking in any way (O III (DM)\n379b-380b; R 490-6).\n4. Empiricism and Scientific Method\n\n\nAnother significant difference between Cartesian and Gassendist views\nof God is that for the latter there is no divine epistemic\nguarantor\u2014indeed, for Gassendi, there is no absolute or\nnecessary guarantee on our epistemic access altogether. There is only\nthe contingent warrant of the senses. In the textbook account of the\nearly modern debate among empiricists and rationalists, Gassendi plays\na bit part in promoting the senses as the ultimate source of our\nworldly knowledge. His views are painted as a vanguard but ultimately\ninconsequential Continental counter to Descartes and as a slight\ninfluence on Locke's more \u2018mature\u2019 empiricism.  Gassendi's\ncontribution is more noteworthy than all that, however. His theory of\nknowledge explicitly addresses historical traditions in epistemology,\ndevelops a proto-reliabilist theory of epistemic warrant, wrestles\nwith timeless difficulties of empiricism, and forms the basis of a set\nof allied views on the nature of scientific investigation.\n\n\nThe need for a theory of empirical knowledge in Gassendi's view stems\nfrom the inadequacy of past and contemporary responses to the\nSkeptics, whose puzzles he finds particularly compelling in the form\nof the tropes as presented by Sextus Empiricus. The Skeptical tropes\ncall our attention to the general problem of whether, given the\nfallibility of the senses, any knowledge is possible and in\nwhat the warrant for such would consist. Gassendi turns the problem\naround, limiting its scope to finding warrant for empirical knowledge\nand declaring the special solution to resolve the general case. His\nsignificant move in this regard is to propose, against the Stoics\n(and, as we have seen, Descartes), that it is not a necessary\ncondition of our knowing some claim that we be certain of it. This\nprobabilism immediately broadens the range of what we can know through\nthe senses\u2014as does his suggestion that we include among such\nclaims to knowledge those assertions about what may be hidden to the\nsenses yet legitimately inferred from evidence of the perceptually\ngiven. This is his theory of sign-based inference, which suggests such\ninferences are legitimate just in case they would be agreed to by a\ngreat enough number of experts giving testimony\u2014or else would be\nfalse only on pain of contradiction.\n\n\nFollowing an Epicurean, physicalist model, Gassendi recommends that\nSkeptical worries are satisfied by truth-criteria and elements of\nepistemic warrant rooted in the regularity and reliability of our\nsensory perception and formation of ideas. Trustworthy evidence from\nthe senses yields warrant for empirical beliefs, albeit without\ncertainty and just in case the evidence for them does not conflict\nwith accepted evidentiary experiences. These claims are built upon the\nproposals that sensory information has a material form (in the case of\nvision, Gassendi promotes an atomist theory of effluxions bearing\nimages or light from the viewed object to the viewer), that the mind\nreceives sensory information through a wholly physical process, and\nthat some cognitive faculties dependably allow us to detect truth\nproperties of the objects of knowledge. The physical process\nunderlying this perceptual account is inspired by Epicurus but the\nphysiological details, optics of light transmission, and\nepistemological lessons are strictly Gassendi's own. Indeed, this\naccount of justification marks him not merely as a proponent of a\ncausal theory (as may be said of Descartes, relative to the divine\nepistemic guarantor) but as an early champion of a reliabilist\napproach to the causal processes, claiming them as the source of\nepistemic warrant.\n\n\nThe negative side of Gassendi's theory of knowledge bows in the\ndirection of the classical Skeptics: we cannot be conclusively certain\nabout, nor find ultimate truths among, empirical beliefs. The positive\nside rejects an absolute Skeptical doubt, however, suggesting that\nempirical knowledge is possible because we can identify a range of\nstrengths that are normally associated with many beliefs about\nappearances\u2014their reliability, approximation to the truth, and\nlikelihood by degrees. This approach\u2014what Popkin calls the\nvia media of Gassendi, the \u2018constructive\u2019\nskepticist\u2014suggests a practicable if approximate understanding\nof the world is within our grasp.\n\n\nThis adumbrated version of empiricism is not without difficulties, as\nGassendi is first to recognize. For one, having extended the warrant\nfor the directly sensed to the indirectly sensed, we must find a way\nto confidently adduce evidence on behalf of what appears before the\nsenses in indirect fashion only. For another, the supposition that\nsolving for empirical knowledge presents a solution for all knowledge\nintroduces the challenge of accounting for at least two apparent\ncounterintuitive instances\u2014knowledge of abstracta and knowledge\nof God and the cosmos (Gassendi subsumes the former to empirical\nknowledge on proto-Millian grounds, but exempts most theological and\ncosmological truth from empirical grasp (O II 398-424,\n440-42)). Finally, he calls our attention to the recursive nature of\nempiricist doubts. If a lack of adequate sensory data strips away\nwarrant for knowledge of the world then an empiricist theory of\nknowledge must also appeal to what the senses tell us, about what we\ncan know of the world. The challenge, then, is to fashion an\nempirically adequate theory of acquiring sensory data. In formulating\nsuch an account, he anticipates crucial elements of later reliabilist\ntheories of warrant.\n\n\nOn the basis of these global views of knowledge in general, Gassendi\ndevelops elements of a theory of knowledge and method specific to the\nscientific endeavor. These elements include the proposal that we\nattain and justify empirical claims with the greatest warrant by\ndeduction\u2014yet those claims are at root probabilistic. He further\nproposes that we maintain hypotheses as the basis of scientific\nreasoning so long as there is empirical evidence for them, however\nbroadly construed. Taken together, these elements constitute a\ncommitment to a hypothetico-deductivism (H-D) which is characteristic\nof some instances of actual scientific reasoning that Gassendi\ndiscusses. This is not a typical or modern species of H-D method,\nhowever, firmly wedded as it is to his empiricism. Indeed, Gassendi's\nmethod cannot be adequately characterized in its entirety in this\nfashion, given the several other forms of non-deductive\ninference that he endorses or makes use of as fundamental to his\nscientific method, including sign-based inference, analogous\nreasoning, and inference to the best explanation.\n\n\nA further element of Gassendi's scientific method consists in his\nappeals to indirect evidence for claims about the unobservable, and\nhis willingness to count such evidence as adequate empirical grounds\nfor maintaining viable hypotheses. The most prominent instance of this\nstrategy is his embrace of an atomist matter theory as a \u2018most\nlikely hypothesis\u2019. Of necessity, any evidence on behalf of this\nhypothesis is to be found in the indirect form of\n\u2018indicative\u2019 signs\u2014these are the surface level\nphenomena for which he takes the existence of atoms to be a sine\nqua non condition. A paramount instance of such evidence in his\nview is what we may see through the microscope, when the visual\nphenomena are explicable only given the existence of the\nmicro-structures we perceive\u2014and in turn those are explicable\nonly in terms of yet smaller structures. Gassendi maintains that the\nmicroscopic observations of crystalline formation and dissolution\ndemonstrate the molecular structure of matter, a key aspect of his\natomism. Equally innovative is his appeal to this putative source of\nwarrant in support of his matter theory.\n\n\nSuch arguments for atomism highlight Gassendi's anticipation of the\nmodern notion of inference to the best explanation (IBE) as a means of\njudging among competing hypotheses. In advancing this strategy, he\nemphasizes the capacity of a given hypothesis to account for a range\nof different phenomena as a guide to the degree to which that\nhypothesis approximates the truth. This strategy for justifying claims\nabout atoms also reaffirms his reliance on empirical data in seeking\nconfirmation of claims regarding the evident and nonevident\nalike. While much is untenable or unlikely about these views, Gassendi\nhas at least offered a set of proposals towards resolving one of\nempiricism's more vexing questions\u2014how to transcend the bounds\nof sensory data. We can know about unobservables like atoms, he\nproposes, just in case our empiricism advances scientific knowledge\nthrough hypothetical reasoning and warrants the sorts of inferences\nabout physical phenomena allowing for unseen features of the\nworld\u2014for which the sensible features can provide evidence.\n5. Atomist Matter Theory\n\n\nThe core of Gassendi's mature philosophy and natural philosophy is his\natomist matter theory. He initially borrows on historical atomist\nsources\u2014primarily Epicurus\u2014but quickly integrates a range\nof atomist claims into his proposed empirically defensible complex of\nphysical, metaphysical, and ethical perspectives. Some aspects of his\natomism fit poorly with the mechanical philosophy it is supposed to\nexemplify. Yet Popkin is correct in suggesting that Gassendi's atomism\nis a premier instance of his philosophical and scientific pursuits\nconstituting one and the same project. The putative empirical support\ndoes not stand up to close inspection, and his particular brand of\nthis matter theory is inconsistent with other elements of the\nmechanical philosophy.  Nonetheless, his atomism provides an\ninnovative and consistent model for micro-level accounts of\nmacro-level physical structures and their behavior, throughout all\nmanner of natural, psychological, and social domains. In this last\nregard, Gassendi's views resemble those of his acquaintance, Hobbes,\nthough with greater attention to core physical details of the matter\ntheory, and fine-grained notions as to how the micro-mechanisms may\noperate.\n\n\nGassendi reveals atomist sympathies in his earliest works and\ncorrespondence, where he rejects much of the style and some of the\nsubstance of philosophy in the late Aristotelian tradition. Indeed,\nsome commentators see Gassendi as a thinker in the Renaissance mold\nwho simply lands on atomism as a central component of a broader\nEpicurean alternative system to the robust range of received\nAristotelian views.  However, though he shares most of Epicurus's\nclaims about atoms (and many Epicurean arguments for those claims),\nGassendi disagrees on key points. This suggests it is the merits of\nthe view itself, that it is the most likely physical hypothesis about\nthe underlying structure of matter, and not simply a general\nrestoration of Epicureanism, that leads him to atomism.\n\n\nThe broadest atomist claims Gassendi makes are rooted in his\nbackground metaphysics and rejection of the infinite divisibility of\nmatter. He grounds the finer points of his atomism\u2014regarding the\nqualities of atoms and their aggregates\u2014on observations,\nexperiment, and interpretations of the same, as well as his\nassessments of alternative perspectives on matter theory. Following the\nEpicurean model (with debts to Lucretius, Democritus, and others\nstill), he starts with a basic ontology of matter and void, and\ndevelops a thoroughgoing account of the physical world rooted in a\npicture of the inherent features of atoms. The general range of\nphenomena and entities for which Gassendi offers atomist accounts owes\nmuch to the ancients. Many of the particular explananda do not,\nthough, and a significant number of his explanatory arguments are his\nown, at least in part.\n\n\nGassendi introduces notions of absolute space and time according to\nwhich the universe is that which contains material Creation. In the\ncolloquial language of metaphysics, he lays out the \u2018floor\nplan\u2019 of his picture of the universe in which he understands God\nto place the \u2018furniture\u2019, namely, atoms and their\namalgams.  Space, time, accident, and substance are the basic and real\n(non-ideal) categories of existence: space and time are not modes of\nsubstance (see section ten). \u2018Matter\u2019 refers to substance\nthat exists in space and time. Indeed, it is the sole and unchanging\nstuff of physical things and so must exist as long as physical things\nexist. Gassendi wants bits of matter to have their distinctive\nqualities without the scholastic imposition of form. In particular, he\nproposes, matter has essential and accidental qualities, though we can\nonly know the accidental ones, through experience.\n\n\nAs for the containing space in which atoms reside, Gassendi offers\nempirical and apriori arguments on behalf of a void. He takes the\nbarometric experiments of his day, including his own at Toulon, to\ndemonstrate the existence of at least a partial, disseminated void.\nMoving beyond such empirical argument, he echoes ancient atomists'\nreasoning. Thus he rehearses the classical arguments that without\ndisseminated void between the parts of bodies, one cannot explain\ndivision and separation of matter at the level of basic particles, and\nthat without the inane coacervatum, one cannot explain the\nmotion of bodies through space.\n\n\nBoth atoms and the void are for Gassendi\n\u2018principles\u2019\u2014by which he apparently means\n\u2018primary element\u2019, following a Scholastic tradition. It\ndoes not follow from this, however, that they are both substantival in\nhis view. Whereas atoms are primary principles of material substance,\nvoids are non-substantival principles of separation in which bodies\nare located, and by which they are separated and have their particular\nsort of supra-atomic structure.\n\n\nTo establish that atoms are the primary principles or elements of\nmatter, Gassendi draws deeply on the well of ancient atomist argument.\nThis sort of \u2018historical evidence\u2019 or\n\u2018testimony\u2019 tolerably counts as one manner of support for\nphysical claims at the dawn of the early modern period. Given\nGassendi's pronounced empiricism, though, the degree of his reliance\non such testimony is surprising. He strikes an even more surprising\nanti-empiricist chord in the introductory chapter of his Physics\n(Physicae Prooemium), pondering a stipulative account of the\nnatural world that consists of the right physical postulates. In the\nend, though, this approach is unacceptable for Gassendi, as such a\nstipulative physics raises more questions than it answers. His\nalternative tack is a series of reasoned defenses of basic atomist\ntenets\u2014frequently, amplifications and restatements of Epicurean\nand Lucretian arguments\u2014including claims as to the existence and\nstatus of atoms as the primary material principles.\n\n\nTo take one example, Gassendi assumes material objects must have\nsome substratum composed of basic and indivisible elements\n(\u2018principles\u2019), and proposes that atoms, as the\nbest candidates for the role of substrata, are the material\nprinciples in question. To arrive at this first assumption, he follows\nEpicurus and Lucretius in adopting the Parmenidean dicta that nothing\ncomes from nothing and (conversely) that all matter must come from\nsomething. He further embraces the ancient view that those dicta\nentail a common substratum for all matter, as the composition and\nresolution of material things always yield matter. To establish that\natoms are the best candidates for serving as this common substratum,\nhe reasons that whatever would serve as matter's substratum\ncannot pass from existence. Moreover, elements of such substratum\nwould be incapable of passing from existence only if they were\nindivisible and thus had no void\u2014that is, were solid. Yet this\ncommon substratum cannot be featureless, formless primary matter, as\nthe Aristotelians propose. It should have some identifiable\nand unchanging features because such features are ineliminable from\nmatter. He concludes that all material objects must be composed of\nelemental particles sharing the features essential to matter\u2014and\nthe particles with those features just are atoms.\n\n\nIn a second line of Lucretian reasoning, Gassendi argues that atoms\nare the primary principles of matter on the grounds that some\nfundamental material elements must be impenetrable if we are to\naccount for varying degrees of resistance in macro-sized objects. He\nsuggests that since all material things resist pressure to some\nextent, they all have one or another degree of solidity. The only way\nto explain this range of solidity, or resistance to pressure, he\nclaims, is by supposing that the ultimate constituent elements of all\nbodies are not soft, which is guaranteed if they are all\nsolid. Otherwise, there could be no bodies harder than the softest\nones, for if the ultimate constituent elements were soft,\nthen more solid bodies could never be composed from them. From this he\nconcludes that all material things must be composed of maximally hard\nelements which, when put together with more empty space between them,\nyield softer bodies\u2014and, when put together with less empty space\nbetween them, yield harder bodies.\n\n\nAs in the previous line of reasoning, Gassendi seeks to establish that\nsome properties of macro-sized objects\u2014variable solidity here,\nimmutable materiality in his first argument\u2014require an\nunderlying atomic architecture. Unfortunately, the atomic account\noffered by the present argument also is not necessary to explaining\nthe macro-property\u2014for we can still have diverse degrees of\nresistance to pressure even if the basic elements of matter also range\nin degrees of solidity. Worse still, this account is not even\nsufficient to the task. Given that atomic size and the amount of\ninterparticulate void are also variable factors, different\ncombinations of these structural characteristics could yield identical\ndegrees of solidity across the otherwise very distinctive macro-level\nobjects they compose. Then varying atomic architectures is not\nsufficient for varying degrees of resistance to pressure in objects on\nthe macro scale.\n\n\nSuch arguments and objections aside, Gassendi focuses his greatest\nefforts to deny matter's infinite divisibility on the relevance of\nmathematical and geometrical considerations to physical accounts of\nmatter's ultimate or near-ultimate particles. While acknowledging the\nbroad conceptual parellel between physical and mathematical continua\nin ancient discussions (O I 262b), he warns against the mistaken\nnotion that physical magnitudes should be infinitely divisible just\nbecause mathematical magnitudes are (O I 263b). This last observation\nby itself fails to establish that atoms are actually divisible. Yet\nGassendi views this notion as the collapse of a major argument against\natomism. More generally, though, he is less swayed by any particular\narguments for or against atomism than he is by the merits and value of\ntaking atomism as a best working hypothesis, with which we may explain\na wide variety of shared properties among macro-sized objects\u2014as\nwell as those properties that differentiate them.\n\n\nA more fundamental task is the enumeration of atomic\nproperties. Gassendi distinguishes between two sorts: those properties\ninherent in and essential to all individual atoms, and those which are\na feature of atoms in groups. His list of inherent atomic features,\nwhich closely follows Epicurus's list, includes: extension, size\n(moles, or more recognizably, magnitudo), shape\n(figura), weight or mass (pondus), and solidity\n(soliditas). Relative to each of these features all atoms\ngenerally resemble one another, there being a limited range of sizes\nand weights. One exception is shape. In order to account for\ntremendous variety among natural objects, Gassendi claims, there must\nbe very many different types of atomic shapes (though not infinitely\nso), and many tokens of each type (again, not infinitely so).\n\n\nAnother notable feature of this list of properties is that it signals\nGassendi's rejection of the cartesian view that extension is\nsufficient to characterize what is essential to the least bit of\nmatter. Descartes is wrong, then, for the same reason that the\nScholastics are wrong to talk about featureless matter in the context\nof physical theory. As Gassendi argues, while we might abstractly\nconceive of matter with one feature such as extension (or none at all,\nper the Scholastics), matter cannot actually come into existence\nwithout the features that God assigns at Creation\u2014namely, size,\nshape, weight, and solidity.\n\n\nThe essential feature of atoms which does the most work in Gassendi's\nphysics\u2014and also generates the most difficulties\u2014is their\ninherent weight, which gives them an intrinsic, natural\ntendency to move. Given this tendency, atomic rest is either\nprovisionary or else an illusion. Atomic weight gives rise not only to\na simple capacity for constant motion, but also to a range of more\ncomplex behaviors, enabling atoms to \u201c\u2026disentangle\nthemselves, to free themselves, to leap away [prosiliendi, to\nspring out], to knock against other atoms, to turn them away\n[retundendi, to check], to move away from them, and similarly\n[they have] the capacity to take hold of each other, to attach\nthemselves to each other, to join together, to bind each other\nfast\u2026\u201d Three other facets of atomic motion merit our\nattention.  First, it must be the general tendency of atoms to move in\nstraight lines given that the atoms here do not feature the\nclinamen, or swerve (contrary to the Epicurean tradition,\nthough perhaps as Epicurus himself would say). Second, Gassendi\nproposes that God endows atoms with a robust set of capacities for\nmoving themselves to varying degrees\u2014leading some commentators\nto see Gassendi as a vitalist or animist. Finally, Gassendi subscribes\nto a seamless compositionality of matter and scalar invariance\nregarding the nature and laws of motion, each of which lead him into\nmurky waters. On the micro-level, he is committed to a constancy of\nmotion that cannot be permanently arrested, whereas on the\nmacro-level, he holds that a principle of inertia governs the motion\nand rest of all bodies.\n\n\nGassendi's compositionality thesis consists of the claim that the\nvaried combinations of atoms give rise to all manner of physical,\nchemical, and biological features of the world and the phenomena they\nexhibit. Two elements of this thesis are noteworthy. First, atoms\ncombine into particular molecular structures that correspond to\nparticular macro-level features and phenomena. This pre-Daltonian view\noffers no suggestion that diverse collections of atoms are the source\nof molecular variety. Yet this molecularism is novel all the same for\nthe broad suggestion that such micro-structures are intermediate-level\nbuilding blocks of macro-structures, and for the particular proposal\nthat the four Aristotelian basic elements be conceived of as molecular\naggregates. Second, molecular structures en gros behave in\nthe same ways as macro-level structures: they can be set in motion,\npulled, elongated, compressed, and so on. In the case of molecular\ncrystal structures, they can replicate, much as their macro-level\ncounterparts can. On the other hand, there are significant\ndissimilarities among atoms and molecules: motion, density, and\nelasticity are all points of difference, which suggest the difficulty\nof a unified and internally consistent matter theory, relative to\nphysical norms or laws. Yet Gassendi is confident that, at least in\nprinciple, the universe could have been created by God with any given\ncomposition of particles, as varying in size, shape, or any other\ndimension. This suggests that from that level of abstraction the laws\ngoverning motion (not contingencies for Gassendi) are intended to be\nscalar invariant. Even in cursory review, these tantalizing claims\nsuggest significant and controversial consequences of stipulating that\natoms have inherent weight and resulting tendencies to motion.\n\n\nA further hallmark of Gassendi's atomic and molecular theories is his\nsuggestion, following the views of early atomists (prominently\nLucretius), that some atoms are endowed with greater activity than\nothers. The varied activity of such special atoms, or semina\nrerum, gives rise to a differential dynamism in matter (of purely\nmaterialist nature), allowing for special organic structures, as well\nas growth of crystals. By contrast, neither atoms nor molecules are\nendowed with powers per se. Nor do atoms bear forces, though\ncertain forces such as gravity can be explained by reference to the\nbehavior of atoms. Chemical forces, on the other hand, have molecular\nexplanations.\n\n\nOne of the greatest challenges to Gassendi's atomism from an internal\nperspective is the seemingly quixotic nature of his search for\nempirical foundations for atomism. In his era there is not the barest\nhint of perceptually-derived knowledge of anything so small. There is,\nhe thinks, an empirically viable source of at least some claims\nconcerning atoms\u2014the indirect data of indicative signs. Yet the\ngeneral tenor of his characterization and defense of physical atomism\nsignals a departure from his customary empiricism. As in his defense\nof an indivisibility thesis, Gassendi relies foremost on reason, not\nexperience, to account for the origin and quantity of atoms and what\nhe takes to be their essential and inessential properties, their\ninternal impetus, motion, and causal role, and their contribution to\nthe motions and qualities we attribute to macrophysical objects. He is\nhardly to be faulted in this regard given the lack of direct empirical\nevidence available. Moreover, his responses to ancient and early\nmodern critics of atomism are firmly within their strategic\nbounds, as they typically rely on reasoned argument without appeal to\nempirical force.\n6. Atomist Natural Philosophy\n\n\nFor Gassendi, the great promise of the atomist hypothesis is the\nexplanatory power across diverse domains of material phenomena (and\nthe great test, where feasible, is the gathering of empirical evidence\non behalf of that hypothesis). Gassendi's advance here is to develop\natomist accounts that are mechanically viable, where none previously\nexisted\u2014whether because prior mechanical approaches were thought\ninapplicable or because no solutions as such approaches yielded were\nactually successful.\n\n\nIn what we today think of as chemistry and physics, Gassendi develops\na great range of applications for his atomist hypothesis. In his\noptics, the atomist theory of light provides a counter to Descartes's\nview of light as pressure. For Gassendi, light is a property carried\nby particular atoms (atomi lucificae) that are identical with\nheat atoms. These tend to travel at greater than average velocity\nbecause they generally have fewer obstacles in their paths than most\natoms (O I 422a-432b). Sound, too, is particulate, and travels as such\nparticles travel. In contrast to a typical sound-wave view, the\nsurrounding medium does not play an important role: Gassendi takes the\nvelocity of sound particles, like that of light particles, to be\ninvariant with respect to the air or wind in which they travel. In an\nexperiment he models after a similar one of Mersenne's, he judges the\nvelocity of sound to be 1,473 ft/sec [478 meters/sec] (his\ncalculations are off by 435 ft/sec [146.7 meters/sec]) and invariant\nto the pitch of the sound (O I 418a-419a).  Even planetary motion has\nan ultimately atomist explanation, as the underlying forces driving\nthe planets are magnetic forces borne by dedicated atoms (this is an\natomist modification of a view developed, though later abandoned, by\nKepler).\n\n\nGassendi's atomist accounts of chemical phenomena are equally\nambitious, suggesting among other things how vapors are created and\nmetals are soluble. Vapors are brought about by increases in the\ndistance between atoms in a liquid volume. Heat atoms remove some of\nthe atoms present in the volume, resulting in a greater percentage of\nvoid and the matter taking the form of vapors (O I 398b-399a). As\nconcerns solubility, we account for aqua regia dissolving\ngold, and aqua fortis dissolving silver, as a result of their\ncomplementary atomic structures: gold atoms fit the pores of aqua\nregia and silver atoms fit the pores of aqua fortis (O\nII 33b ff, 39a-b).\n\n\nIn the realm of biological phenomena, Gassendi offers greatly diverse\naccounts drawing on an atomist framework. His most significant\nproposal in this regard is an account of generation and inheritance in\nterms of a material \u2018soul\u2019 or animula bearing\nontogenetic information. In sexual reproduction, two sets of seminal\nmatter and corresponding animulae meet and jointly determine the\ndivision, differentiation, and development of matter in the new\norganism. The determination of inherited traits requires combining or\nchoosing among each parent's contributions, entailing competition and\ndominance among the animulae (O II 284b-285a). The animula is defined\nin terms of its constituent atoms, which must be uniform in order that\nanimulae may operate equivalently across different modes of\ngeneration, whether \u2018pre-organized\u2019 or\nspontaneous. Further, Gassendi offers his molecular model as a\nmaterial means of storing ontogenetic information received from the\nsouls of parent organisms (O II 170b-171a, 280b).\n\n\nRather more curious stories are found in his accounts of development,\nphysiology, and behavioral psychology. Thus, the root cause of\nincreased shellfish growth and marrow production during full moons is\nincreased humidity, stemming from the excitement of lunar moisture\ncorpuscles by sunlight. These corpuscles are then transported to the\nEarth by rays from the sun reflected off the moon (O I 450a-451a). He\naccounts for toxicological phenomena, such as the stunning capacity of\nelectric rays (torpedine), as emission of corpuscles with a\ndulling power (O I 454b-455a). Other poisons provoke strange behavior,\nsuch as those of the tarantula. These may work by producing activity\nin the victim sympathetic to the attacker's activity, a result of\nchemical alterations the poisons bring about in the victim's sensory\ncapacities and attunements (O I 456a). As concerns animal psychology,\nGassendi endorses Lucretius's suggestion (RN IV) that lions avoid\nroosters at dawn because the latter can inject harmful corpuscles into\nthe former's eyes (O I 453b-454a). Sheep avoid unfamiliar wolves\nbecause wolves emit corpuscles of an odor offensive to sheep (O I\n456a).\n\n\nAs concerns human psychology, Gassendi offers a materialist (hence\nultimately atomist) account of the passions as a function of the\nvegetative soul, including desire and fear, and motivating pleasure\nand pain (O II 474f, 495f); these are ultimately governed, however, by\nthe rational and immaterial soul. There are, broadly, any number of\ncognitive faculties and attributes that may be built out of or be\nproduced by atoms, Gassendi suggests, countering Lactantius's\ncomplaint that the \u2018senses, thought, memory, the mind, genius,\n[or] reason\u2019 cannot so be constructed. As with the passions,\nthough, there are limits.  A viable atomist story can be told of\nsensory phenomena and idea-formation though not reason and its allied\nphenomena (O I 282b).  Yet there is clearly some grey area, as memory\nin particular seems open to a purely materialist account. Memory loss\nresults from a physical change in the brain resulting from\nundernourishment; folds in brain matter preserve the physical\nembodiment of memory, but a deficiency in nutrition leads to the\ndeterioration of those folds (O II 406b-407b; a similar Cartesian view\nappears in the Treatise on Man (AT XI 177-178)).\n7. Materialism, Libertinism, and Ethics\n\n\nThe thoroughgoing nature of Gassendi's atomism has led numerous\ncommentators from Descartes to Marx to view him as taking all worldly\nstructures and behaviors to be explicable by the interaction of\nmaterial bodies.  According to this picture, Gassendi leaves little if\nany room for the existence of non-material substance or its relevance\nto metaphysical or natural accounts. One piece of putative evidence\nfor materialism in Gassendi's corpus is his extension of atomist\nexplanation, from all physical phenomena to a large range of\nnon-physical phenomena, including aspects of the mental, social, and\nethical. This is not entirely compelling, as we have seen that the\nmaterial underpinnings of our mental apparatuses is relevant to only\nsome portion of his psychology.\n\n\nA second piece of suggestive evidence for Gassendi's materialism is\nhistoriographical and rhetorical in character. Epicurus and Lucretius\nwere the great ancient materialists, Gassendi is their great early\nmodern exponent, hence Gassendi too was a materialist\u2014his\nChurch-oriented misgivings notwithstanding. This thesis requires\nthinking of Gassendi as holding closeted views relative to the Church\nand Holy Writ, and indeed many of his views are highly nuanced in this\nregard (q.v. his stance on Galileo). It is not clear, however, that\nGassendi intends anything other than a carefully delimited set of\naccounts of materialist ilk, within what he considers to be the proper\nrealm of the physical. Strictly speaking, though, materialism is not a\ndoctrine by degrees, and that Gassendi's proposed realm of the\nmaterial extends beyond the reach of other, competing views of his\ntime does not make him a materialist in the pure sense.\n\n\nA third piece of suggestive evidence was Gassendi's membership in the\ngroup known as the libertins \u00e9rudits.  Other\nmembers of this diverse group, on a broad construal, included Guy\nPatin, Pierre Charron, Fran\u00e7ois Le Vayer La Mothe, Gabriel\nNaud\u00e9, Th\u00e9ophile de Viau, and Cyrano de Bergerac.\nMoli\u00e8re is also sometimes considered to have belonged to the\nlibertins, and he is thought to have studied under Gassendi's\ninformal tutelage (Sortais 1922). Gassendi's ties to the\nlibertins also brought him in contact with a range of other\nintellectuals and artists\u2014the latter including, most notably,\nNicolas Poussin. The libertins, constituting more of a\nliterary salon than the philosophically- and scientifically-oriented\nMersenne circle, promoted a morality determined by reason, stripped of\ntheological considerations, and defined on an individualist basis. In\ntheir commitment to intellectual liberty, they professed a diverse mix\nof metaphysical and epistemic views, especially materialism,\nskepticism, rationalism, deism, and Epicureanism\u2014each party to\nthe group offering a different mix.  They were politically and\nsocially savvy enough to promote their libertine views in a manner and\nstyle that verges on the secretive.  Such secrecy as a guiding\nstylistic force can be seen in aspects of Gassendi's writing and\nrhetorical style, as he frequently makes allusions likely to be\nunderstood only by his friends or the equally erudite, constantly\ndraws on expressions from ancient sources to make his own points, and\noffers a variety of quasi-coded rhetorical elements, most famously\nincluding his somewhat hesitant and qualified endorsement of the\nCopernican model.\n\n\nOwing to their largely individualist conception of ethics\u2014and in\nkeeping with late Renaissance tradition, the libertins tended\nto avoid political theory and larger social issues, focusing instead\non self-governance and morality understood in terms of\ncharacter. Gassendi generally follows this conception in his ethics\n(Sarasohn 1996), though he also outlines a broader political theory\n(Paganini, 1989-1990). Aside from elements of his ethics and rhetoric,\nit is an open question as to how much effect Gassendi's association\nwith the libertins had on his views\u2014or for that matter,\nhow much influence he may have had on them. In one area in\nparticular\u2014obeisance to the Church and its teachings\u2014he\ndiverges significantly from his libertin counterparts.\nGassendi routinely emphasizes the sacred nature of Holy Writ and the\nnecessity (as well as benefits) of amending Epicurean thought to meet\nstrictures of accepted dogma. This adherence suggests that Gassendi's\ninterests in personal responsibility, empirical investigation, and the\nunderlying nature of matter did not signal a consummate atheistic\nhumanism, denial of spiritual activity, or materialism. If anything,\none might suppose that his innovative ethics, scientific method, and\nphysics were artificially constrained by his canonical beliefs. A more\naccurate reading is that he trod a line between Church orthodoxies\nand the most radical alternatives associated with the mechanical\nphilosophy and early modern ethics, such as we find in\nHobbes. Gassendi was a moderate modern thinker, promoting the new\nagainst a background of opposition the potential of which he knew\nquite well.\n\n\nThough we lack grounds for calling Gassendi a complete materialist\nmoralist, a broad look at his ethics may suggest strong links to his\nphysics, in a Hobbesian manner (Sarasohn 1996). This parallel should\nnot be taken too far: Gassendi and Hobbes diverge in their views of\nhuman agency and disagree about our unfettered, non-physically\ndetermined capacity for moral deliberation. However, they each accept\nthat pleasure in some way motivates moral choice (though Gassendi also\nmakes allowance for the role of irrational appetite).\n\n\nIndeed, insofar as Gassendi considers pleasure to be a\nmaterially-realized phenomenon, he shares Hobbes's view of the morally\ncorrect as something that can be defined in physical terms.  However,\naccording to Gassendi and the lessons he draws from his Epicurean and\nStoic sources, any spirtually-related pleasure trumps any\nmaterially-related one (O II 710a-b). The truest pleasures\u2014hence\ngoods\u2014are defined along the lines of Epicurean ataraxia\n(attainment of tranquility) and Christian virtues, including in\nparticular love of God, and friendship and good will among\npersons. The guarantee of our ability to seek tranquility or fulfill\nthese virtues is our free intellectual judgment\n(libertas). Such a freedom consists in the ability of our\nintellects to choose between good and evil, and this is turn yields\nour capacity for volition, or free will (O II 821b-822b).\n\n\nFree will and the ability to exercise conscience are also key concepts\nunderlying Gassendi's views on society and the body politic. Gassendi\nagrees with Hobbes (and shares a Lucretian inspiration (Sarasohn\n1996)) that individuals in a pre-social setting are motivated by fear\nand desire for betterment, which leads them to join in a commonwealth\nand concede at least some rights. For Hobbes, this motivation is\ndriven mechanically, and the commonwealth entails foregoing individual\nrights in return for security. For Gassendi, on the other hand, the\nmotivation is driven by irreducible reasoned consideration, in favor\nof the stability of social convention. Further, this social contract\nleaves intact at least those freedoms and liberties which, to begin\nwith, figured in rational choice of the contract over the state of\nindividual insecurity. Gassendi veers from a strict physicalism,\nproposing that societies are organized by social agreements chosen\nthrough operations of the immaterial animus (O II 795a).\n8. Space and Time\n\n\nEven putting aside the framework of atoms and void, the Gassendist\nontology poses an alternative to rival Aristotelian and Cartesian\nviews, with respect to space and time. Gassendi's conception of time\nand space is absolute. Time flows uniformly irrespective of any\nmotion, and space is uniformly extended regardless of any objects that\nmay be contained within it (O I 183, 285). Indeed, both space and time\npre-date Creation, and are infinite in character.\n\n\nGassendi borrows heavily on themes set out by earlier Italian space\nand time theorists, including Campanella, Bruno, Telesio, and Patrizi.\nOne possible advance is suggested by his discussion of such an\nontology as a prelude to his matter theory: space and time are\npre-conditions for the existence of substance, rather than properties\nof substances (as the Aristotelians would have it). In this regard,\nRochot (1971) proposes that Gassendi's ontology provides atoms as\nstable entities and absolute space-time as a stable environment, which\ntogether allow for a greater reliability of empirical data hence a\ngreater reliability of our data reception. The notion is that those data\nhave some fixity at the source, at least, given that the\nspace-time environment that contains material elements giving rise to\nsuch data are unbended by relativistic position to anything else.\nNaturally, such fixity would be only a necessary condition, and even\nfails to provide guarantees at the level of basic sensory data, which\nGassendi recognizes in his discussion of the Skepticist tropes.\n\n\nGassendi's notion of non-relative space stands in direct\ncontrast to the Cartesian plenist account, which suggests that space\njust is place, as defined by the extension of the resident (and\nuniversal) matter. This contrast bears a clear result relative to\nmatter theory: Descartes is locked into a view of matter as infinitely\ndivisible, in order to account for the absence of void or, what amounts\nto the same thing, the omnipresence of matter. Gassendi, on the other\nhand, is free to pose the existence of atoms and the void, where matter\nis located in space but is neither defined by nor definitive of that\nspace.\n9. Logic\n\n\nBroadly speaking, Gassendi expresses some three notions of logic in\nthe Syntagma. The first, enunciated in the history of logic\nsection that appears immediately prior to the Institutio\nLogica, suggests a picture of logic along heuristic and didactic\nlines, in the manner of Ramus, whose theory Gassendi lauds as a guide\nto organizing and presenting existing knowledge (O I 59a-62b). The\nsecond suggests that logic consists in the Aristotelian syllogistic,\nthe understanding thereof, and related methodological concerns. The\nthird suggests that logic consists in the study and use of causal\nreasoning, and related methodological concerns\u2014most notably\nincluding an exposition of regressus demonstrativa theory in\nthe manner of Zabarella and Nifo (this notion expressly contradicts\nhis Exercitationes view that such causal reasoning cannot be\njustified).  These latter two notions yield the main thrust of the\nInstitutio (though the discussion of demonstration in Book IV\nhas clear Ramist debts). They also have great currency for Gassendi,\nwho typically crafts his use of syllogism and causal inference and\nmethod after his Institutio conceptions, or at least signals\nthat he intends to do so. The same may not be said for his Ramist\nconception.  For although he makes ample use of rhetoric, he does not\nturn to definition, distribution, or division for the purposes of\ndiagramming or expounding existing knowledge\u2014per the logic of\nRamus\u2014in any way that matches his interest in the traditionally\nAristotelian conception of analysis as problem-solving.\n\n\nIt has been suggested that a fourth notion\u2014a psychologistic\naccount of cognitive operations, and perception in particular\u2014is\na prominent goal of Gassendi's logic (Michael, 1997). While such\ndiscussion forms part of the Institutio presentation, it is\nby no means the main goal of the work or of Gassendi's conception of\nlogic.  This can be seen from the thrust and length of his discussion\nof the first three elements, and in particular syllogistic and causal\nreasoning, and their attendant methodologies.\n10. The Scientific Endeavor: Astronomy, Optics, and Mechanics\n\n\nGassendi's science is philosophically noteworthy in the way\nthat Descartes' or Kepler's science is, drawing on a robust\nset of views on the nature of the world and what we know of it. His\nscientific work in astronomy, optics, and mechanics is of particular\nimport in suggesting how we should pursue a purely empirical picture of\nthe world, within the limitations of our sensory access and the\nconstraints of tradition.\n\n\nThe principal elements of Gassendi's astronomy include a global\nembrace of empirical method, advanced instrumentation, and\nmeasurement, an interest in unusual celestial phenomena, and a\npartially masked defense of Copernicanism. His embrace of an\nempiricist astronomy can be gauged by his voluminous recorded\nobservations\u2014some presumably with the telescope lenses sent by\nhis friend Galileo\u2014carried out in concert with a league of\nfellow observers strung across Europe and the Near East. A primary\ngoal of these recorded observations was to confirm and extend the\nRudolphine Tables, the project set up by Tycho Brahe and completed by\nKepler, to facilitate calculation of the planet's positions\n(which goal in itself suggests Gassendi's adherence to a\nKeplerian heliocentrism). Another facet of Gassendi's empiricist\nastronomy was his denunciation of astrology as crafted independent of\nany ideas from the senses, impervious to correction by experiment or\nobservation, and thus as failing to qualify as natural or experiential\nknowledge.  This view brought him into direct and bitter conflict with\nJean-Baptiste Morin, who also suspected Gassendi of an\narch-Copernicanism that was not only against Church teaching but would\nobviate the astrological structures central to Morin's theories.\nGassendi's close interests in observation also led to employing\nthe camera obscura to gauge variations in the apparent\ndiameter of the moon\u2014in accordance with its orbit of the Earth\nand the apparent diameter of the Sun. Further, in his work with\nPeiresc, Gassendi tackled the problem of determining longitude by\nreference to lunar eclipses, later working towards this goal with\nClaude Mellan on the first effort to chart the moon.\n\n\nGassendi's interests in unusual celestial phenomena dates back as\nearly as 1621, when he observed the colorful illumination of the sky\nand dubbed these lights \u2018aurora borealis\u2019. Based on his\ncorrespondence with observers as far away as the Levant, he located\nthe source of the illumination at very high altitude, above the\nNorthern Polar region. In 1629, he observed the rare phenomenon of\nparhelia, or false suns, which he explained in his Parhelia\nseu soles\u2026, in terms of the reflection of sunlight by ice or\nsnow crystals at high altitude. This account, shown to be accurate in\nthe nineteenth century, relies on the views of Gassendi and\nPeiresc\u2014based on their microscopical observations\u2014that\ncrystal formations of snow and ice are highly reflective. The great\ntriumph of Gassendi's scanning of the skies was his observation of\nMercury's transit before the Sun (1631), the first such recorded\nobservation and a confirmation of Kepler's prediction of the planetary\norbits in accordance with the Three Laws. This confirmation in turn\nenabled the subsequent calculations (Halley and Gallet, 1677) of the\ndistance between the Earth, the Sun, and the other planets.\n\n\nThe most controversial element of Gassendi's astronomy concerns\nwhether, and to what extent, he may be counted as a defender of\nGalileo and the Copernican view. There is little question that he\nsympathized with Galileo, and that he was fully aware of the merits of\nCopernicanism, at times defending the view and some of its main planks\nopenly. Yet he was also clearly concerned with allegiance to Holy Writ\nas interpreted by the Church, and to this end offers a Church-friendly\naccount of the condemnation that focuses not on the underlying\nheliocentrism but on particularities of the Galilean model (O V 60b).\nHis considered judgment is that the Tychean model is preferable to the\nPtolemaic model, but also to the Copernican model\u2014in the latter\ncase simply because the heliocentric picture does not fit with Church\nteachings. He hastens to suggest, however, that those teachings are\nthemselves warranted by our own current empirical evidence\u2014the\nimplication being that such truths and the concomitant rejection of\nCopernicanism might well be revisable.\n\n\nClosely related to Gassendi's interests in astronomy are a number of\nissues in optics, where he sought to articulate a physiological model\nof vision and a physical model of light. In so doing, Gassendi\ncontributed to early modern efforts that would eventuate in\ndistinguishing these two ends of traditional optics.\n\n\nHis integrated optics model follows an Epicurean and Lucretian\nintromission view, that vision is a function of rays of light atoms or\nimage-bearing atoms that are received by our internal apparatus for\nvision. The structure of this apparatus was of great concern to\nGassendi and his early collaborator on naturalist projects, Peiresc.\nThe premise of their work was that Kepler was largely correct in\npostulating an optical image that gathers many rays into a coherent\nrepresentation in the eye, focused on the retina by the crystalline\nlens. What troubled Gassendi and Peiresc, however, was the notion that\nsuch an image as cast upon the retina would be inverted, leaving the\nproblem of identifying how we see the world as right-side up. Seeking\na physiological solution\u2014as against any psychological capacity\nthat rights the inverted image\u2014they suggested that the retina\nitself acts as a mirror which rights the inverted image projected upon\nit.\n\n\nAnother aspect of this integrated approach to optics was a reliance on\ninternal perceptual phenomena to account for external phenomena\nregarding appearances, illusory or otherwise. This was not a\nuniversally-held view, even in the age of the optics of light and\nvision. In addition to Gassendi's interest in parhelia, he also sought\nto explain apparent discrepancies in the size of the sun and moon at\ndifferent hours by reference to visual experience produced by light\nphenomena (De apparente magnitudine\u2026, 1642). Thus,\nthese bodies appear larger on the horizon than at their apogee because\nthe pupil dilates from the differential exposure to the light at the\nhorizon. (In fact, all such apparent differences are produced by the\ndistance effect of surface features of the area from which the\ncelestial body is viewed.) One key driver of such an appeal to the\ninteraction of light behavior and our visual apparatuses is Gassendi's\nview that some explanatory role must be played here by the common\natomic structure underlying the images intromitted into our eyes and\nthe light rays cast by celestial bodies which are understood as\ncreating such images.\n\n\nGassendi's mechanics shows the strong influence of the Galilean\nprogramme. He addresses the law of free-fall twice, first in a faulty\ntreatment in De Motu (1642), and next in corrected fashion in\nDe proportione qua gravia decidentia accelerantur (1646). In\nthe earlier work, Gassendi focuses on forces compelling the falling\nbody, which he takes to comprise the attractive force of magnetism and\nthe propelling force of air behind the falling body. This combination\nof forces, he suggests, allows for the Galilean law that the distance\ntraveled by bodies in free-fall is proportional to the time of fall\nsquared. However, Gassendi mistakenly takes increases in velocity and\nin distances to be equivalent, leading him to manufacture a false need\nfor greater velocity attained than what would be produced by the\nattractive forces alone. In De Proportione, he acknowledges\nthis error, amends his calculations, and retreats to a causal account\nthat rests on the single force of the terrestrial magnetic\nattraction. This is not one of Gassendi's empirical triumphs,\nthough\u2014in neither work does he make any specific reference to\nobservations or experiments.\n\n\nOne notable success in the experimental domain is his performance of\nthe Galilean test of dropping a stone from the mast of a moving ship,\nrecorded in De Motu. Once dropped, Gassendi shows, the stone\nconserves its horizontal speed (equal to that of the ship, before\nbeing released) and its motion describes a parabola given its downward\nfall. This result successfully refutes one simple anti-Copernican\nargument, by showing that the Earth can move without superadding\nmotion to terrestrial objects otherwise in motion (which\nsuperaddition, opponents of Copernicanism correctly maintained, would\ngenerate much havoc in the motion of terrestrial objects). This much\nGalileo surmised in his original thought experiment, though the\nperformance was excellent publicity for the Galilean perspective and\nan opportunity for Gassendi to think through the issues at stake.\n\n\nIn this regard, Gassendi was able to take a step beyond Galileo's\nconclusions, drawing from this test a generalized principle of inertia\n(the Galilean version of inertia was fundamentally circular, given\nthat bodies in motion would trace the earth's curve). Gassendi saw\nthat the motion of the dropped stone at a sustained speed\u2014in the\nabsence of any contrary force or obstacle\u2014is an instance of\ninertial motion, albeit one where the motion is compositional\n(describing the parabola). Indeed, neither compositionality nor\ndirectionality had any impact on inertial motion, Gassendi concluded:\nany body set in motion in any direction continues, unless impeded, in\nrectilinear path.\n\n\nOther accomplishments in physics included a compelling measurement of\nthe speed of sound (showing that sound travels at the same speed, no\nmatter the nature of its pitch), and the first satisfactory\ninterpretation of the Pascalian barometry experiment. In his account\nof the Puy-de-D\u00f4me experiment, Gassendi proposes that variations\nin air pressure are relative to atmospheric conditions and altitude,\nas the air is an elastic gas. He also suggests that this experiment\n(which he repeats at Toulon in 1650) shows that created vacuum is\npossible, at least as accumulated among part of the air particles in\nthe instrument \u2018sealed\u2019 by the mercury column in the\nexperimental apparatus. In establishing the elasticity of air as a gas\nand accumulated void as a result of particle displacement, Gassendi\nevokes his ontology of atoms and the void.\n11. Impact and Influence\n\n\nGassendi's views were often transmitted in the early modern era\nthrough the medium of Fran\u00e7ois Bernier's\nAbr\u00e9g\u00e9 (1678/84), which work highlights the\natomist views and materialist tendencies of Gassendism. Such themes,\nas well as empiricist threads of Gassendism, were attractive to a\nnumber of late seventeenth century physicists and physicians\n(viz. Nicholas de Bl\u00e9gny, Guy Patin, Antoine Menjot, and\nGuillaume Lamy) and other philosophers (viz. Gilles de Launay), as\nwell as those among the Montmor circle or libertins\n\u00e9rudits (viz.  Samuel Sorbi\u00e8re, Jean Chapelain, and\nCyrano de Bergerac). Still others, especially Cartesians such as\nDesgabets and Cordemoy, were rather distasteful of those themes, as\nwere hard-line theologians such as Louis Le Valois.\n\n\nAs Lennon (1993), Brockliss (1997), and others have noted,\nGassendi's overall influence in the French education system was\nnot a match for the Cartesian alternatives, and his views were\nconsidered especially unworthy after his atomist views gained currency\nin England.\n\n\nThe British success of Gassendism had three textual sources. In\naddition to the Opera Omnia and Bernier's\nAbr\u00e9g\u00e9, Walter Charleton produced a selective\nand amended English translation of parts of the Animadversiones,\nintermingled with other sources and his own perspectives (1654). There\nwas as well a group of atomist enthusiasts in the Newcastle Circle,\nand a small existing British Epicurean club, whose members included\nKenelm Digby and Nathaniel Highmore. This backdrop of sympathetic\nsources, not entirely faithful to the original, allowed a substantial\nand diffuse influence of Gassendi's views in British thought. We see\nGassendism shaping the work of lesser figures such as Francis Glisson\n(who embraced a vis motrix) and Thomas Willis (who crafted a\nmaterialist theory of neural transmission based on Gassendi's view\n(Wallace 2003)) but also such major thinkers as Boyle, Locke, Newton,\nHume, and Reid. Those sources of influence themselves were\nsufficiently diffuse that it is difficult to make precise Gassendi's\nimprint on these later authors, except where they explicitly\nacknowledge their debts.\n\n\nBoyle finds Gassendi's thinking agreeable in three respects.  First,\nhe embraces Gassendi's criticism of Descartes' ontological argument as\nrooted in an assumption as to the nature of God impervious to\nproof. Second, he follows in the Gassendist model of placing\nempiricism and experiment at the center of a viable scientific\nmethod. Third, he praises Gassendi's corpuscularian theory as a worthy\nontology for the mechanical model of explanation, hastening to add\nthat further experimentation should give sufficient demonstration of\nthe verity of atomism. Indeed, he refuses to judge between the\nGassendist and Cartesian alternatives, presumably on the grounds that\nwe cannot produce evidence to decide the issue of matter's infinite\ndivisibility.\n\n\nAs Locke is concerned, it is by now well established that he may have\nread Gassendi directly, and almost certainly read Bernier. The\nevidence of influence shows up in some central Lockean theses: the\ncorpuscularian philosophy (here he follows Boyle as surely as he does\nGassendi), primary and secondary qualities distinction (a view also\nheld by Boyle, Descartes, Galileo, and others still), and broad\ncommitment to empiricism, including the negative thesis against innate\nideas and the positive thesis identifying sensory data as the primary\nsource of ideas. We also see Gassendi's likely inspiration in Locke's\nprobabilist embrace of an understanding of natural philosophy through\nless-than-certain claims about the world, though his sub-par ranking\nof \u2018sensitive apprehension\u2019 of the world is a rejection of\nthe Gassendist picture of sensory knowledge as the best for which we\nmight hope. Locke's theory of language, too, reveals Gassendi's\ninfluence: the notion of nominal essences resonates with the proposal\nin the Institutio Logica that the meaning of general terms is a\nfunction of our sensory-based ideas, which contribute to our picture\nof the properties we typically associate with the objects of those\nterms. Finally, in regard to ethics, Locke offers a perfectly\nGassendist linkage between good and evil on the one hand and pleasure\nand pain on the other, and like Gassendi celebrates the notion of\npersonal autonomy, though he locates the seat of moral judgment in\nexternal norms (most prominently, the natural law) rather than any\ninternal ideals or virtues such as Gassendi upholds.\n\n\nNewton reveals various interests in Gassendist themes, dating to an\nearly reading in his student days (see the Trinity\nNotebooks). For one, he adopts the notion that Aristotelian\nsubstance and accident fail to define all existents, and (along with\nBarrow, who likely read Gassendi as well) suggests that absolute space\nand time represent the fundamental ontological framework into which\nmatter and its phenomena are located. For another, he espouses a form\nof the mechanical philosophy, albeit one that departs from orthodoxy\n(as pronounced by Gassendi) in that God plays a significant and\nsustained role in determining the course of natural phenomena. Here he\nfollows Gassendi's thought most closely in admitting atoms to his\nontology, nearly replicating Gassendi's list of atomic properties,\nproposing that atomic structures yield chemical bonds that account for\nthe structures of larger bodies, and endorsing the Gassendist notion\nof light as flowing in a stream of atoms (in opposition to the\nCartesian wave theory promoted by Hooke and Huygens).  In the spirit\nof Boyle, though, Newton tends to treat his matter theory as\ninstrumentally useful rather than as a universal hypothesis in search\nof further instances. In this way he hopes to avoid the hard questions\nabout our ability to summon empirical verification of their existence\nor precise character. One famous Newtonian methodological dictum\nindicates there are aspects of atoms we can know, however. In the\nPrincipia (1687), Newton suggests a transdictive principle of\nGassendist provenance (also embraced by Locke), according to which the\nbasic properties of bodies on the micro-scale (\u201cthe least\nparticles of all bodies\u201d) may be inferred from such properties\nof bodies as we have evidence of, on the macro-scale.\n\n\nHume is less interested in affirming ontologies than in showing why we\nhave no good reason to invest belief in them, and accordingly picks up\non the rather different Gassendist theme of coming to terms with the\nancient Skeptics. His moderate or constructive skepticism\n(pace Popkin) is founded on doubts concerning the possibility\nof justified belief, focusing on the problem of induction as the great\ndifficulty undercutting our ability to know about the world. Lacking\nrational justification, we simply fall back on induction as a\npracticable means of grasping and managing our experience of events.\nHere we see a striking similarity with Gassendi's\nassessment\u2014beginning with the observation that justifying any\ngeneralization on particulars requires something beyond our cognitive\npowers, namely, our empirical knowledge of all such particulars. From\nthis point, Hume draws the Gassendist lesson that induction cannot be\ndemonstrative, for lack of this generalization step or the supposition\n\u201cthat apart from those enumerated there occurs none which is\ndifferent\u201d (O I (Institutio Logica) 113a). Finally,\nHume's proposed resolution also resembles Gassendi's notion that we\nmight simply posit, as a matter of utility, the conformity of all\nremaining unenumerated particulars.\n\n\nInto the late eighteenth century, we see Gassendi's influence in\nReid's theory of external knowledge. This theory is centered on the\nnotion of what he calls \u2018suggestion\u2019, or the evincing in\nus by our sensory data of concepts corresponding to the qualities of\nthings in the world. In its broad sense, \u2018suggestion\u2019\nconsists in a signing relationship\u2014as a matter of convention,\ncustom, or biology\u2014between things or events in the world which\nmay be construed as signs (in the case of conventional signs, these\nmay be linguistic or symbolic entities) and what those things or\nevents signify. Here Reid draws on the long tradition of theories of\nsigns, likely relying in this instance on Gassendi in particular,\nrelative to the distinction between conventional\n(\u2018artificial\u2019) and customary and biological\n(\u2018natural\u2019).\n\n\nGassendi's influence spread further still, beyond Britain or the\nmodern era. The young Leibniz consciously followed Gassendi in\nembracing atomism, later retaining high regard for mechanism but\nabandoning the material model of substance in favor of the monadology\n(Moll 1982). Christiaan Huygens pursued numerous Gassendist themes,\nincluding anti-Aristotelianism, probabilism, a method of hypothesis,\nand atomist matter theory. Gassendi's libertine, atomist, empiricist,\nand quasi-heliocentrist views also met with keen interest further\nafield, among like-minded philosophers and natural scientists in early\nmodern Poland, Italy, and Spain (Murr, 1997). In more recent times,\nGassendi would come to be seen as anticipating such notable views as\nMill's proposal that mathematical knowledge is empirical, and Popper's\nnotion that empirical falsifiability is a test of a hypothesis'\nprima facie viability.\n12. Recent Commentary on Gassendi\n\n\nThe precise place of Gassendi in the history of early modern\nphilosophy and science is only partly articulated by recent\nscholarship, which has tended to focus on one aspect or another of his\nthought, and to portray Gassendi primarily as an opponent of one or\nanother contemporary, to the neglect of his positive theses. The\nlaudable goal of such contextualist studies is to demonstrate his key\nrole in important debates of the era, yet the picture that emerges\nfrom deliberation on these commentaries is rather Gassendi's relative\neclipse by other figures, notably Descartes. For example, one\nhistorical approach (Brundell, 1987) highlights a strong\nanti-Aristotelian strain which guides Gassendi's earlier criticisms of\nthe Scholastics as well as his later Epicurean works.  From this\nperspective, Gassendi may be seen as fighting the same battles as\nDescartes, and losing in any such comparison because he engages his\nfoes with generally lesser flash and apparently less sophisticated, or\nat least less novel, weaponry. Another common approach (Joy, 1987;\nDarmon, 1998; Mazauric, 1998; Taussig, 2001 and 2003) is to emphasize\nhistoricist and rhetorical elements of Gassendi's method, as employed\nin his conversations and correspondence with members of the Mersenne\ncircle. Gassendi's role in that context was by no means marginal, and\nit is impossible to downplay the centrality of that circle in early\nmodern scientific debate. Yet the most important figure to this group\nwas not actually an active participant in it, and this was\nDescartes. Mersenne, of course, is the other core personality in this\ncontext, and so Gassendi by default is at best a third. Gassendi\nperhaps fares worst in comparison with Descartes in recent discussions\nof their direct conflict over the Meditations, where\nGassendi's anti-Cartesian views are presented as a prism through which\nwe may best perceive the spectrum of his views (Osler 1994, Lennon\n1993, Grene and Ariew 1995). There is undoubtedly a case to be made\nthat he represents the most prominent alternative to Descartes in his\ntimes. However, highlighting this story encourages the view that\nGassendi deserves no more than footnote status and emphasizes, at\nleast historically speaking, his role as the losing\nalternative.\n\n\nAnother fashion has it that Gassendi's doctrinal beliefs form the\nfoundation of, or otherwise influence, his philosophical and\nscientific views. One such perspective suggests that his spiritual\nconcerns and materialist ontology jointly shape the character of his\nmetaphysics\u2014leading to irresolvable internal conflict (Bloch\n1971, Sortais 1922). Another perspective has it that his theological\nviews, and specifically his voluntarism, lead him to his empiricism\n(Osler 1994, Sarasohn 1996). But it is not clear that Gassendi is best\nunderstood as laboring in service of a doctrinal credo, or as\nmotivating his philosophical views by appeal to his theological\nsensibility. He indeed tailors his Epicurean views to meet theological\nconstraints and endorses the only astronomical world-view he believes\nacceptable to the Church, that of Tycho Brahe. Yet Gassendi's\ndefinitive criterion for any physical, metaphysical, or\nepistemological thesis is approximation to the truth, which is\nempirically-determined.  On the other hand, some theologically\ninspired claims are woven into the fabric of his metaphysics and\npsychology. For example, there are two souls, one sensitive and the\nother spiritual, and the latter is required in order to satisfy\nreligious demands for an immortal unity attached to, but not\nsusceptible to the fate of, the material body. But in such cases\nGassendi is generally clear about non-philosophical motives,\nintroducing such corrections or additions to his reasoned or\nempirically demonstrated views as are necessary by the dictates of\nfaith or Scripture. He frequently defends the primacy of Roman\nCatholicism and faith over natural reason (O I 5a, O I 49a, O II\n237a-b) yet easily distinguishes between objects of scientific and\ntheological investigation and reflection (O III (De\nProportione) 636a). To suggest that he arrives at the core tenets\nof his metaphysics or epistemology in order to draw out the ultimate\nconsequences of his theology thereby misconstrues his broad\nphilosophical motives as well as his particular reflective and\ninvestigative strategies.\n\n\nBy contrast, another element of recent scholarship highlights\nGassendi's philosophical motivations and strategies in sensu\nstrictu. In the years during and following the Second World War,\nBernard Rochot began this trend by bringing to light numerous\nlesser-known texts as well as the manuscript background to Gassendist\natomism. More recently, Fred and Emily Michael have called attention\nto empiricist sources and features of Gassendi's psychology and\nepistemology. Others offering assessments of Gassendi's views in\nsimilarly strict philosophical terms include Wolfgang Detel, Marco\nMesseri, and Antonia LoLordo. In this interpretive tradition, Richard\nPopkin elegantly poses the global character of the empiricism linking\nGassendist philosophy and science. Popkin (1967) ties together two\ncentral facets of Gassendi's thought, proposing that the\n\u2018constructive skepticism\u2019 at the core of his epistemology\nis an attempt (among other things) to show how to have an atomist\nscience\u2014through inferences based on our data concerning\nappearances.\n\n\nThe starting point of Gassendi's philosophy, in Popkin's view, is\nskepticism about knowledge of essences, mitigated by allowance for\nwarranted beliefs about appearances and causal knowledge to which we\nare entitled just because it helps us to make sense of beliefs about\nappearances. Among the intriguing elements of Popkin's assessment is\nthe suggestion that Gassendi promotes an early prototype of inference\nto the best explanation (IBE), defending atomism by appealing to its\nexplanatory value. Gassendi's strategy is a bit more complicated, for\nhe cannot grant that the evidence could be equally compelling for all\ncompeting theses, given his view that atomism is the physical thesis\nwhich best makes intelligible our experiential data to begin with. The\nunderlying methodological suggestion is that, in considering among\nphysical theses, the way we understand and interpret correlative data\nabout appearances may depend on which such thesis we are\nentertaining. In calling attention to Gassendi's appeal to IBE, Popkin\nidentifies a principal challenge in binding together principal themes\nof Gassendi's corpus, how to be an atomist and a thoroughgoing\nempiricist at once (Fisher 2005).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Gassendi's Principal Works", "Early Translation and Commentary", "Modern Editions and Translations", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Gassendi's Principal Works": ["</h3>\n<ul>", "<em>Exercitationes paradoxicae adversus aristoteleos, in quibus\npraecipua totius peripateticae doctrinae fundamenta excutiuntur,\nopiniones vero aut novae, aut ex vetustioribus obsoletae stabiliuntur,\nauctore Petro Gassendo.</em> Grenoble: Pierre Verdier, 1624 [Book One];\nLyon: Laurent Anisson and Jean Baptiste Devenet, 1658 [Book Two].", "<em>Epistolica exercitatio, in qua principia philosophiae Roberti Flvddi\nmedici reteguntur; et ad recentes illius libros, aduersus r.p.f.\nMarinvm Mersennvm ordinis minimorum Sancti Francisci de Paula scriptos,\nrespondetur.
