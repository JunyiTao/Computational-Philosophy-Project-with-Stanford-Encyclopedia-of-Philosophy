    "main_text": "Philosophical Foundations || The rule by impartial standards and the principle of impartiality\n2.3 The rule by impartial standards and the principle of impartiality\n\nEarly in the twentieth century, Liang Qichao identified the difference\nbetween the fa thinkers and their Confucian rivals as the\ndichotomy between the rule of fa (fazhi\n\u6cd5\u6cbb) over the \u201crule of men\u201d (renzhi\n\u4eba\u6cbb). This correct observation generated considerable\nconfusion, because the compound fazhi is used in modern\nChinese for the Western \u201crule of law.\u201d Putting aside the\ndebates about the similarities and dissimilarities between the rule of\nfa and the \u201crule of law,\u201d it is advisable to\nanalyze the former on its own terms rather than through the prism of\nOccidental thought. \n\nGraziani (forthcoming) notes that the concept of fa was\ninitially associated with precision tools\u2014such as T-squares,\ncompasses, weights, and measures\u2014which were considered more\nreliable than individual skills of artisans or merchants. Similarly,\nin the political sphere, fa\u2014referring to an entirety of\nimpersonal norms, laws, regulations, and institutional\nsolutions\u2014was deemed more reliable than the habitual appeal to\nthe incumbents\u2019 personal abilities and moral qualities. Han Fei\nexplains:\n\n\nFor correcting the oversights of superiors, for prosecuting the\nwickedness of subordinates, for bringing order to chaos and sorting\nout tangles, for removing the superfluous and evening out the wrong,\nand for uniting the tracks of the people, nothing is as good as\nfa. (Han Feizi 6.5, \u201cHaving\nstandards\u201d)\n\n\nTo become effective regulator of sociopolitical life,\nfa\u2014especially in its meaning as\n\u201claw\u201d\u2014 must be fair and transparent. Fairness means\nthat laws are applicable equally to every subject, and even the ruler\nhimself should strictly observe them. Whereas the ruler has the\nright\u2014actually the duty\u2014to alter the laws when the\ncircumstances demand this\u2014he is actively dissuaded against\nwhimsical intervention in current laws and norms. Thus, he should\nabide by the fixed rules of promotion and demotion and never allow\npersonal favorites to be promoted at the expense of truly meritorious\nservants (see more in 5.2). As for transparency, it means that laws\nshould be understood by everybody. Han Fei clarifies:\n\n\nAs for fa, it is compiled and written down on charts and\ndocuments, deposited in the repositories of the offices and\npromulgated to the hundred clans. \u2026 Therefore, when the\nclear-sighted ruler speaks of fa, everyone within his\nfrontiers, including the lowly and base, will hear and understand it.\n(Han Feizi 38.8.2, \u201cObjections 3\u201d)\n\n\nThe principle of transparency and the importance of legal knowledge of\nthe populace (including \u201cthe lowly and base\u201d) stands also\nat the center of chapter 26 (\u201cFixing divisions\u201d) of the\nBook of Lord Shang. As such fa is not a tool of\nintimidation and suppression as is often imagined (despite the\nnotorious advocacy of harsh punishments in the fa texts).\nRather it refers to common rules of the game that should be\ninternalized by every political actor.\n\nThe rule by impersonal standards is not just the most effective way of\novercoming personal inadequacies of the incumbents. It is also the\nmoral way, insofar as morality is represented by the principle of\nimpartiality rather than by Confucian insistence on \u201cbenevolence\nand righteousness\u201d (renyi \u4ec1\u7fa9) (Jiang\n2021: 267 ff.). Impartiality (gong \u516c) is the opposite\nof selfishness (si \u79c1). It also stands for the common\ninterests of the people. Whereas the term gong normally\nrefers to the ruler (\u201cduke,\u201d or \u201cregional\nlord\u201d), which implies that \u201ccommon\u201d interests of the\nsubjects are identical to those of the sovereign (Liu Zehua 2003:\n332\u2013373; Goldin 2020: 204\u2013205), in practice the two were\ndifferentiated (see section 5.2). An impartial fa was not\njust the means to improve the ruler\u2019s governance but also the\nbest means to overcome the ruler\u2019s potential ineptitude.\n",
