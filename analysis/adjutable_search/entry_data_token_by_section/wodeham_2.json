Position in the History of Philosophy\n\nAdam Wodeham\u2019s place in the history of philosophy remains\ndifficult to appreciate because of two related problems, here referred\nto as: (1) the historiographical problem; and (2) the textual problem.\nHistoriographically, the field of medieval philosophy has been plagued\nby various narrative accounts of the twelfth through fifteenth\ncenturies that characterize the period in which Wodeham flourished as\nan age in which fideism, skepticism and scholastic decadence ruled the\nday (Inglis, 1998). This basic historiographical approach to the late\nmedieval period has recently come under serious attack and scrutiny by\nspecialists working in the field, but a balanced picture of the\nphilosophers and theologians working during this period remains in its\ninfancy. Second, an accurate understanding of Adam Wodeham\u2019s\nplace within the history of philosophy is handicapped by the lack of\ncritical editions for Adam Wodeham, his immediate contemporaries, and\nnumerous medieval philosophers and theologians working in the late\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Regarding Wodeham, it is important\nto recognize that a critical edition of any complete text of Wodeham\nwas not available until recently (Wood 1988; G\u00e1l and Wood\n1990). Further, as already noted, an edition of Wodeham\u2019s most\nmature and complete work, the Ordinatio, is only now\nunderway. As such, the place of Adam Wodeham within the history of\nmedieval thought is difficult to trace at present, and William\nCourtenay\u2019s important study remains the most relevant point of\nreference (Courtenay, 1978).\n\nBased on the work of Courtenay, the first references to\nWodeham\u2019s place within medieval thought must begin by\nconsidering his socii (or contemporary\nsententiarii). Wodeham lectured on the Sentences at\nOxford in 1332\u20131334, and contemporaneous with his lectures there\nwere other bachelors lecturing on the Sentences\n(baccalarius sententiarius) in the various other convents or\ntheological schools (Courtenay 1978, 89). Understanding who these\nbachelors are is important because they often engaged with each\nother\u2019s work. In the case of Adam Wodeham the list of\nsocii includes: Monachus Niger (Benedictine), Robert Holcot\nOP, William Crathorn OP, Roger Gosford OP, Edmund Grafton OFM, Hugh\nGrafton OESA, William Chiterne OFM, William Skelton: Mertonian,\nRichard of Radford, and an unnamed Carmelite (Courtenay 1978,\n89\u2013111).\n\nBeyond his immediate socii, Wodeham\u2019s influence between\n1334 and 1346 is evident in England, Paris and Cologne. English\ntheologians, between 1334 and 1350, often do not cite contemporaries\nby name. That said, there is substantial evidence that Wodeham\u2019s\ncontemporaries took his thought seriously. During these decades,\nCourtenay lists the following English theologians as making either\nimplicit or explicit reference to Adam Wodeham\u2019s\nlecturae: Thomas Bradwardine (Mertonian), Robert of Halifax\nOFM, Roger Roseth OFM and Thomas Buckingham (Mertonian) (Courtenay\n1978, 116\u2013123). In contrast to the English authors discussed\nabove, the Parisian authors between 1342 and 1345 were much more\nwilling to cite a contemporary author (Courtenay 1978, 123). Thus, in\nthis period almost all of the Parisian theologians commenting on the\nSentences cite Wodeham: Gregory of Rimini OESA, Alphonsus\nVargas OESA and John of Mirecourt (Cistercian). These authors exhibit\na strong knowledge of Wodeham and all had some access to the Oxford\n(Ordinatio) redaction of Wodeham\u2019s work (Courtenay\n1978, 132). In particular one should note Gregory of Rimini\u2019s\nextensive knowledge of the thought of Wodeham. The spread of\nOckham\u2019s philosophical and theological thought into Germany\n(both directly and indirectly through the study of Wodeham) took place\nbetween 1335 and 1350 and is evident in Cologne. This is perhaps due\nto the fact that Wodeham traveled to Basel in the summer of 1339\nbringing with him a copy of his Ordinatio (Courtenay 1978,\n133 and 181). How long Wodeham remained in Germany, or where he\ntraveled, remains unknown. But, it is significant that in Cologne,\nsometime before 1348, one theologian lectured on the Sentences\nsecundum Adam (Courtenay 1978, 133). This and other evidence\nsuggest that Wodeham was being studied seriously in Cologne before\n1348.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Parisian condemnations of Nicholas of\nAutrecourt in 1346 and John of Mirecourt in 1347, one may expect that\nthe influence of Wodeham would have waned in subsequent years. But,\nCourtenay argues that the citations of Wodeham throughout this\nturbulent period demonstrate that this was not the case (Courtenay\n1978, 135). Evidence of Parisian masters engaging the thought of\nWodeham in the years after 1347 is evident in the works of: Peter\nCeffons O.Cist. and Hugolino Malabrancha of Oriveto OESA.\n\nIn the final four decades of the fourteenth century there is an\nincrease in the citations of the moderni as evidenced in the\nextant commentaries. The list of commentaries that cite Wodeham\nincludes: the anonymous author of ms. Vat. Lat. 986, John Hiltalingen\nof Basel OESA, James of Eltville O.Cist, Conrad of Ebrach O.Cist.,\nPierre d\u2019Ailly, Henry Totting of Oyta, John of Wasia, Henry of\nLangenstein, Nicholas of Dinkelsb\u00fchl, Peter of Candia, John\nBrammart O.C., Peter Plaoul, and Marsilius of Inghen. This period of\nmedieval philosophy remains understudied, but it is clear that there\nwas a strong interest in Wodeham at the close of the fourteenth\ncentury. Further evidence of this is found in Henry Totting of\nOyta\u2019s Abbreviato of Adam Wodeham\u2019s\nOrdinatio produced between 1373 and 1378 (Courtenay 1978,\n147). Oyta\u2019s Abbreviato of Wodeham was influential in\nthe fifteenth century, as is clear from the number of extant\nmanuscripts spread throughout Europe.\n\nThe influence of Wodeham\u2019s thought in the fifteenth and early\nsixteenth centuries is a chapter of medieval philosophy and theology\nthat has yet to be written. There are citations of Wodeham in the\nworks of Arnold of Sehnsen O.C., Peter Reicher/Pirchenward, John\nCapreolus, Gabriel Biel and John Mair (Major), although the evidence\nat this point has yet to be analyzed in detail (Courtenay 1978,\n150\u2013156). What is certain is that Wodeham remained important for\nphilosophers and theologians in the long fifteenth century, and John\nMair eventually, in the sixteenth century, published an edition of\nOyta\u2019s Abbreviato. This has been both positive and\nnegative for Wodeham studies: positive, as Wodeham has remained\navailable to those who do not have access to the manuscript tradition;\nand negative as it has meant that scholars often read and cite an\ninferior text that significantly abbreviates the original work. More\nattention should be given to the influence of Wodeham in this\nperiod.\n\n",
