    "main_text": "High Tide: The Dial, Fuller, Thoreau\n3. Social and Political Critiques\n\nThe transcendentalists operated from the start with the sense that the\nsociety around them was seriously deficient: a \u201cmass\u201d of\n\u201cbugs or spawn\u201d as Emerson put it in \u201cThe American\nScholar\u201d; slavedrivers of themselves, as Thoreau says in\nWalden. Thus the attraction of alternative life-styles:\nAlcott\u2019s ill-fated Fruitlands; Brook Farm, planned and organized\nby the Transcendental Club; Thoreau\u2019s cabin at Walden. As the\nnineteenth century came to its mid-point, the\ntranscendentalists\u2019 dissatisfaction with their society became\nfocused on policies and actions of the United States government: the\ntreatment of the Native Americans, the war with Mexico, and, above\nall, the continuing and expanding practice of slavery.\n\nEmerson\u2019s 1838 letter to President Martin Van Buren is an early\nexpression of the depth of his despair at actions of his country, in\nthis case the ethnic cleansing of American land east of the\nMississippi. The 16,000 Cherokees lived in what is now Kentucky and\nTennessee, and in parts of the Carolinas, Georgia, and Virginia. They\nwere one of the more assimilated tribes, whose members owned property,\ndrove carriages, used plows and spinning wheels, and even owned\nslaves. Wealthy Cherokees sent their children to elite academies or\nseminaries. The Cherokee chief refused to sign a \u201cremoval\u201d\nagreement with the government of Andrew Jackson, but the government\nfound a minority faction to agree to move to territories west of the\nMississippi. Despite the ruling by the Supreme Court under Chief\nJustice John Marshall that the Cherokee Nation\u2019s sovereignty had\nbeen violated, Jackson\u2019s policies continued to take effect. In\n1838, President Van Buren, Jackson\u2019s former Vice-President and\napproved successor, ordered the U. S. Army into the Cherokee Nation,\nwhere they rounded up as many remaining members of the tribe as they\ncould and marched them west and across the Mississippi. Thousands died\nalong the way. In his letter to President Van Buren, Emerson calls\nthis \u201ca crime that really deprives us as well as the Cherokees\nof a country; for how could we call the conspiracy that should crush\nthese poor Indians our Government, or the land that was cursed by\ntheir parting and dying imprecations our country, any more?\u201d (A,\n3).\n\nSlavery had existed in the United States from the beginnings of the\ncountry, but the question of its morality and entrenchment within the\nAmerican political system came to the fore with the annexation of\nTexas, where slavery was legal, and its admission to the Union as the\n28th state in 1845. Emerson\u2019s breakout address \u201cOn the\nEmancipation of the Negroes in the British West Indies\u201d (1844)\nwas delivered in this context. (The Slavery Abolition Act was passed\nby the British Parliament in 1833 and celebrated annually in Concord.)\nIn his address Emerson wrote: \u201cLanguage must be raked, the\nsecrets of slaughter-houses and infamous holes that cannot front the\nday, must be ransacked, to tell what negro-slavery has been. These\nmen, our benefactors, \u2026 the producers of comfort and luxury for\nthe civilized world. \u2026 I am heartsick when I read how they came\nthere, and how they are kept there. Their case was left out of the\nmind and out of the heart of their brothers\u201d (A, 9).\n\nFrederick Douglass spoke in Concord at Thoreau\u2019s invitation, and\nwas on the dais in Concord in August 1844, when Emerson delivered his\nemancipation address, where he states: \u201cThe Black Man carries in\nhis bosom an indispensable element of a new and coming\ncivilization\u201d (Wirzbicki, 95; A, 31). Douglass took up\nEmerson\u2019s term \u201cself-reliance\u201d in advice to his\nreaders and hearers, and he quotes \u201cThe American Scholar\u201d\nin his abolitionist newspaper North Star. \u201cIt is a\nmischievous notion,\u201d Douglass quotes Emerson as saying,\n\u201cthat we are come late into nature; that the world was finished\na long time ago. As the world was plastic and fluid in the hands of\nGod so is it ever to so much of his attribute that we bring to\nit\u201d (Wirzbicki, 53; O, 47).\n\nAnother important black abolitionist with Transcendentalist leanings\nand connections was William C. Nell, who founded Boston\u2019s\nAdelphic Union Library Association in 1836. Nell attended Bronson\nAlcott\u2019s conversations, heard Emerson speak, and participated in\nEmerson\u2019s Town and Country Club. He referred to Emerson as the\n\u201cever-to-be-honored friend of equal rights\u201d (Wirzbicki,\n55). The leadership of Nell\u2019s Association was black, but invited\nspeakers included prominent black and white abolitionists, including\nDouglass, Wendell Phillips, and Angelina Grimk\u00e9. Nell founded\nthe New England Freedom Association in 1842 to \u201cextend the\nhelping hand to the \u2018chattel\u2019 who may have taken to itself\n\u2018wings\u2019\u201d (Wirzbicki, 148); and he joined with Lewis\nHayden (who had escaped slavery in Kentucky) to establish the Boston\nVigilance Committee after passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850.\nThoreau worked with both Nell and Hayden. He brought Hayden to Concord\nto speak to the Concord Female Anti-Slavery Society, and he\ncontributed to the Underground Railroad by hosting fugitives in his\ncabin at Walden Pond (Wirzbicki, 158).\n\nFuller addresses American slavery directly in Woman in the\nNineteenth Century, recalling her dread at the news that James K.\nPolk, a Tennessee slaveholder who favored the extension of slavery to\nTexas, had been elected the nation\u2019s 11th president (by an\nall-male electorate). The \u201cchoice of the people,\u201d she\nwrote, \u201cthreatens to rivet the chains of slavery and the leprosy\nof sin permanently on this nation, with the annexation of\nTexas!\u201d (F, 97). Addressing \u201c[t]he women of my\ncountry,\u201d she asks: \u201chave you nothing to do with this? You\nsee the men, how they are willing to sell shamelessly, the happiness\nof countless generations of fellow-creatures, the honor of their\ncountry, and their immortal souls for a money market and political\npower. Do you not feel within you that which can reprove them, which\ncan check, which can convince them? You would not speak in vain;\nwhether each in her own home, or banded in union\u201d (F, 98).\n\nThis call both to the individual and to individuals acting together\ncharacterizes Thoreau\u2019s \u201cResistance to Civil\nGovernment\u201d (1849). Thoreau was arrested in 1846 for nonpayment\nof his poll tax, and he took the opportunity presented by his night in\njail to meditate on the authority of the state. The government,\nThoreau argues, is but an expedient by which we succeed \u201cin\nletting one another alone\u201d (R, 64). The citizen has no duty to\nresign his conscience to the state, and may even have a duty to oppose\nimmoral legislation such as that which supports slavery and the\nMexican War. Thoreau concludes: \u201cI cannot for an instant\nrecognize that political organization as my government which is the\nslave\u2019s government also\u201d (R, 67). Slavery could be\nabolished by a \u201cpeaceable revolution,\u201d he continues, if\npeople refused to pay their taxes and clogged the system by going to\njail (R, 76).\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Law passed by the United States Congress in 1850\nhad dramatic and visible effects not only in Georgia or Mississippi\nbut in Massachusetts and New York. For the law required all citizens\nof the country to assist in returning fugitive slaves to their owners.\nThis extension of the slave-system to the north, the subject of\nThoreau\u2019s \u201cSlavery in Massachusetts\u201d (1854), was on\npublic view when an escaped slave named Anthony Burns was captured in\nBoston, tried by a Massachusetts court, and escorted by the\nMassachusetts militia and U. S. marines to the harbor, where he was\ntaken back to slavery in Virginia. His owner placed him in a notorious\n\u201cslave pen\u201d outside Richmond, where Burns was handcuffed,\nchained at the ankles and left to lie in his own filth for four\nmonths. Thoreau denounced the absurdity of a court in Boston\n\u201ctrying a MAN, to find out if he is not really a SLAVE,\u201d\nwhen the question has already been \u201cdecided from eternity\u201d\n(R, 92). In his \u201cLecture on Slavery\u201d of 1855, Emerson\ncalls the original 1787 Constitution\u2019s recognition of slavery a\n\u201ccrime\u201d (A, 100), and he contrasts the written law of the\nconstitution with the \u201cLaws\u201d and \u201cRight\u201d\nascertained by Jesus, Menu, Moses, and Confucius. An immoral law, he\nholds, is void.\n\nAlthough Thoreau advocated nonviolent action in \u201cResistance to\nCivil Government,\u201d he later supported the violent actions of\nJohn Brown, who killed unarmed pro-slavery settlers in Kansas, and in\n1859 attacked the federal arsenal at Harper\u2019s Ferry, Virginia.\nIn \u201cA Plea for Captain John Brown,\u201d Thoreau portrays Brown\nas an \u201cAngel of Light\u201d (R, 137) and \u201ca\ntranscendentalist above all\u201d (115) who believed \u201cthat a\nman has a perfect right to interfere by force with the slaveholder, in\norder to rescue the slave\u201d (R,132). In early 1860, just months\nbefore the outbreak of the Civil War, he and Emerson participated in\npublic commemorations of Brown\u2019s life and actions.\n",
