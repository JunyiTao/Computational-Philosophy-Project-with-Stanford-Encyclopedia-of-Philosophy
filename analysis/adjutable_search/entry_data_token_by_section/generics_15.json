Cognitive psychology has long\nbeen interested in understanding how our conceptual knowledge\nconcerning kinds is organized and represented; however, until somewhat\nrecently the connection with generic sentences, and the\ngeneralizations they articulate, had not been explored.\nPsychologists\u2019 interest in generics lies primarily with what\nthese sentences can reveal about our basic ways of conceiving of\nkinds, rather than specifically with formulating a semantic analysis\nof Gen. However, several results from psychology arguably\nplace important constraints on what the semantics of generic sentences\nmight look like.\n",
