    "main_text": "Halfway Between Induction and Deduction\n11. Halfway Between Induction and Deduction\n\nA different way to draw the distinction, not hinted at by Beardsley\nbut perhaps acceptable to him, would be in terms of the nature of the\ninferential relation between (1) and (2). (1) doesn\u2019t entail\n(2), but, as Beardsley admits, it does provide inductive support for\n(2). (1) may or may not be criterial evidence for (2), however. What\nthis last claim means can be made clearer by an analogy with W.D\nRoss\u2019s theory of ethical reasoning.\n\nAccording to Ross,\n\n(L)\nAct A is a lie\n\n\ndoesn\u2019t entail\n\n(W)\nAct A is wrong,\n\n\nfor A might be right even so, when all ethically relevant\nfactors are taken into account. If A helps to save innocent\npeople\u2019s lives, for example, it\u2019s right\u2014actually\nright, as Ross says\u2014even though it\u2019s a lie. Nor is the\nrelation between (L) and (W) causal or inductive. Lying doesn\u2019t\ncause wrongness, and although it might be that most (or even all) lies\nare all-things-considered wrong\u2014actually wrong\u2014it might be\nthat most (or even all) lies aren\u2019t all-things-considered\nwrong\u2014actually wrong. Regardless of which alternative (if\neither) is correct, (L) still provides some reason for thinking that\n(W) is true. That\u2019s to say that the inference from (L) to (W)\nisn\u2019t based on an empirical generalization of any kind. Rather\nthan being deductive evidence or empirically based inductive evidence,\n(L) is criterial evidence for (W). All by itself, irrespective of any\nother considerations, any other premises, it lends some\u00a0but not\ndefinitive\u00a0support to (W). The inference is an immediate one, in\nother words, in the logician\u2019s sense of the term, and since it\nis and isn\u2019t grounded on empirical facts, it looks like a\ndeductive inference. It\u2019s not a deductive inference, however:\nunlike a standard deductive inference, but like a standard inductive\ninference, additional premises\u2014such as \u201cAct A\nsaves many people\u2019s lives\u201d, or \u201cAct A leads\nto many people\u2019s deaths\u201d\u2014can affect the strength of\nthe inference, weakening it in some cases, strengthening it in others,\nand having little to no effect on it in still others. As with a\ntypical inductive argument, strength of inference isn\u2019t an\nall-or-nothing affair. The inference is defeasible, in that\ncountervailing considerations can weigh against the support the\npremise provides, even to the point of nullifying it altogether, or at\nleast very nearly doing so; but it\u2019s also buttressable, in that\nadditional considerations can bolster or further strengthen such\nsupport, even to the point of making the inference well-nigh\ndeductively sound. Or, of course, the inference can be strengthened by\nsome considerations and weakened by others.\n\nWhat this means is that there can be criterial evidence of an\naltogether different sort for (or against) (W).\n\n(3)\nAct A is an act of betraying a friend\n\n\nis also criterial evidence for (W), and there are many other examples\nof such evidence. Whether the wrongness of an act is constituted by\nsuch factors as lying and betrayal, or whether it\u2019s a different\nproperty which supervenes on such factors, is of no moment as far as\nthe matter at hand is concerned. The important point is the\nlogic\u2014or better, the epistemology\u2014of the inferential\nrelation.\n\nWhat all this has to do with the intentional fallacy is this. The\nintentionalist shouldn\u2019t claim that (1) entails (2), for that\nclaim is subject to the numerous counterarguments that Beardsley makes\nfull use of. But the anti-intentionalist, such as Beardsley,\nshouldn\u2019t claim that there\u2019s \u201cno logical\nrelation\u201d between (1) and (2), for there clearly is, even on his\nown showing, a causally grounded, empirically based, standard\ninductive relation between the two. The intentionalist shouldn\u2019t\nrejoice at this admission, however. For two reasons, such a relation\ntells us nothing of any significance about the proper way to interpret\nart. First, similar causal relations can be found to obtain in\nvirtually every domain of inquiry, and they tell us nothing\nsignificant about proper methodology in those domains. The fact that\ntall parents generally have tall children, and tall children generally\nhave tall parents, is of no help in establishing proper methodology in\ngenetics, or even in telling us where to begin our investigation.\nSecond, and more importantly, being founded on a causal connection\nbetween two distinct things, namely\u00a0the artist\u2019s intention\nand the meaning of his work, the empirical generalization that\nunderlies the inference from (1) to (2) presupposes that there\u2019s\na way to identify the meaning of an artist\u2019s work independent of\nconsulting his intentions. That\u2019s not something the\nintentionalist who relies only on a causal connection between the two\nshould be very happy about, for it suggests that the artist\u2019s\nintentions are altogether extrinsic to and independent of the meaning\nof the artist\u2019s work.\n\nThe real debate about the intentional fallacy is, or at least should\nbe, over whether (1) provides criterial evidence for (2). Beardsley\nargues against an entailment relation between the two, admits that\nthere\u2019s an inductive relation but relegates it to the category\nof indirect evidence, and thinks the job is done. The intentionalist\ntypically wonders how the meaning of a work can be utterly divorced\nfrom the voice, the uttering or creating with an intended meaning, of\nthe artist, and brings up hard cases to support the relevance of the\nartist\u2019s intentions. But neither has focused the issue properly.\nBeardsley apparently takes direct evidence to be deductively adequate\nevidence or evidence gleaned from the object itself, and indirect\nevidence to be evidence based on empirical generalizations or gleaned\nfrom something other than the object itself. In neither sense is an\nartist\u2019s intentions direct evidence of what his work means, and\nBeardsley is right that there\u2019s an intentional fallacy. But if,\nas it should be, direct evidence is identified with criterial\nevidence, and indirect evidence with non-criterial but inductive\nevidence, Beardsley has failed to establish that there\u2019s an\nintentional fallacy. On the other hand, the mere strong feeling of the\nintentionalist that the meaning of a work isn\u2019t independent of\nthe intentions of the artist who created it is no proof of anything,\nand the hard cases brought up in support of the relevance of the\nartist\u2019s intentions\u2014typically, cases that involve\nallusion, irony, or obscure passages\u2014can almost always be\nexplained or explained away, and not implausibly, by the\nanti-intentionalist. The mistake of Beardsley is to neglect a\npossibility and thus focus the issue wrongly. The mistake of the\nintentionalist is typically not to focus the issue with any degree of\nprecision, and to rely on relatively vague but strongly held\nintuitions.\n",
