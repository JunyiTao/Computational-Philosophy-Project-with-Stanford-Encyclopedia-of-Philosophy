Formal Approaches to Social Epistemology\n\nWe have now seen some of the problems that face those who develop\naccounts of knowledge acquisition within a community. In recent years\nphilosophers have turned to formal methods to understand some of these\nsocial aspects of belief and knowledge formation. There are broadly\ntwo approaches in this vein. The first comes from the field of formal\nepistemology, which mostly uses proof-based methods to consider\nquestions that mostly originate within individual-focused\nepistemology. Some work in this field, though, considers questions\nrelated to, for example, judgment aggregation and testimony. The\nsecond approach, sometimes dubbed \u201cformal social\nepistemology,\u201d stems largely from philosophy of science, where\nresearchers have employed modeling methods to understand the workings\nof epistemic communities. While much of this work has been motivated\nby a desire to understand the workings of science, it is often widely\napplicable to social aspects of belief formation.\n\nAnother distinction between these traditions is that while formal\nepistemologists tend to focus on questions related to ideal belief\ncreation, such as what constitutes rationality, formal social\nepistemologists have been more interested in explaining real human\nbehavior, and designing good knowledge-creation systems. We will now\nbriefly discuss relevant work from formal epistemology, and then look\nat three topics in formal social epistemology.\n",
