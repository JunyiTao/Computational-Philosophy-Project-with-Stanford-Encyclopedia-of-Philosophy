    "main_text": "\n\nFeminist Ethics aims \u201cto understand, criticize, and\ncorrect\u201d how gender operates within our moral beliefs and\npractices (Lindemann 2005, 11) and our methodological approaches to\nethical theory. More specifically, feminist ethicists aim to\nunderstand, criticize, and correct: (1) the binary view of gender, (2)\nthe privilege historically available to men, and/or (3) the ways that\nviews about gender maintain oppressive social orders or practices that\nharm others, especially girls and women who historically have been\nsubordinated, along gendered dimensions including sexuality and\ngender-identity. Since oppression often involves ignoring the\nperspectives of the marginalized, different approaches to feminist\nethics have in common a commitment to better understand the\nexperiences of persons oppressed in gendered ways. That commitment\nresults in a tendency, in feminist ethics, to take into account\nempirical information and material actualities.\n\nNot all feminist ethicists correct all of (1) through (3). Some have\nassumed or upheld the gender binary (Wollstonecraft 1792; Firestone\n1970). They criticize and aim to correct the privileging of men as the\nmore morally worthy half of the binary, or argue against the\nmaintenance of a social order that oppresses others in gendered ways.\nMore recently, feminist ethicists have commonly criticized the gender\nbinary itself, arguing that upholding a fixed conception of the world\nas constituted only by \u201cbiological\u201d men and women\ncontributes to the maintenance of oppressive and gendered social\norders, especially when doing so marginalizes those who do not conform\nto gender binaries (Butler 1990; Bettcher 2014; Dea 2016a). Feminist\nethicists who are attentive to the intersections of multiple aspects\nof identity including race, class, and disability, in addition to\ngender, criticize and correct assumptions that men\nsimpliciter are historically privileged, as if privilege\ndistributes equally among all men regardless of how they are socially\nsituated. They instead focus more on criticizing and correcting\noppressive practices that harm and marginalize others who live at\nthese intersections in order to account for the distinctive\nexperiences of women whose experiences are not those of members of\nculturally dominant groups (Crenshaw 1991; Khader 2013). Whatever the\nfocus of feminist ethicists, a widely shared characteristic of their\nworks is at least some overt attention to power, privilege, or limited\naccess to social goods. In a broad sense, then, feminist ethics is\nfundamentally political (Tong 1993, 160). This is not necessarily a\nfeature of feminist ethics that distinguishes it from\n\u201cmainstream\u201d ethics, however, since feminist analyses of\nethical theory as arising from material and nonideal contexts suggest\nthat all ethics is political whether its being so is recognized by the\ntheorist or not.\n\nSince feminist ethics is not merely a branch of ethics, but is instead\n\u201ca way of doing ethics\u201d (Lindemann 2005, 4),\nphilosophers engaged in the above tasks can be concerned with any\nbranch of ethics, including meta-ethics, normative theory, and\npractical or applied ethics. The point of feminist ethics is, ideally,\nto change ethics for the better by improving ethical theorizing and\noffering better approaches to issues including those involving gender.\nFeminist ethics is not limited to gendered issues because the insights\nof feminist ethics are often applicable to analyses of moral\nexperiences that share features with gendered issues or that reflect\nthe intersection of gender with other bases of oppression. Feminist\nphilosophical endeavors include bringing investigations motivated by\nfeminist ethics to bear on ethical issues, broadly conceived.\n",
