    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cWhat indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem?\u201d (246) This\nquestion of the relation between reason \u2013 here represented by\nAthens \u2013 and faith \u2013 represented by Jerusalem \u2013 was posed\nby the church father Tertullian (c.160\u2013230 CE), and it remains a\ncentral preoccupation among contemporary philosophers of religion.\n\n\u201cFideism\u201d is the name given to that school of\nthought \u2013 to which Tertullian himself is frequently said to have\nsubscribed \u2013 which answers that faith is in some sense independent\nof, if not outright adversarial toward, reason. In contrast to the\nmore rationalistic tradition of natural theology, with its arguments\nfor the existence of God, fideism holds \u2013 or at any rate\nappears to hold (more on this caveat shortly) \u2013 that\nreason is unnecessary and inappropriate for the exercise and\njustification of religious belief. The term itself derives from\nfides, the Latin word for faith, and can be rendered\nliterally as faith-ism. \u201cFideism\u201d is thus to be\nunderstood not as a synonym for \u201creligious belief,\u201d but as\ndenoting a particular philosophical account of faith\u2019s\nappropriate jurisdiction vis-a-vis that of reason.\n",
