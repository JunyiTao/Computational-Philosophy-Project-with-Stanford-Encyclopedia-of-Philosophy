    "main_text": "Definitional Concerns || Transientism and Permanentism\n3.4 Transientism and Permanentism\n\nA different sort of response to definitional worries is to recast the\ndebate between presentists and non-presentists as a debate concerning\ntwo distinct, opposing theses: transientism and\npermanentism. Whereas presentism and eternalism are views\nabout what exists, transientism and permanentism are views about\nwhether things begin or cease to exist. Transientism is the view that:\nsometimes, something begins to exist and, sometimes, something ceases\nto exist; permanentism is the view that: always, everything always\nexists (Deasy 2015, 2017, 2019a; Cameron 2016; cf. Sullivan 2012).\n\nOne suggestion is that, if we accept that the traditional\npresentism-eternalism debate is flawed because of definitional\nworries, then the traditional debate should \u201cgive way\u201d to\nthe new transientism-permanentism debate (e.g., Williamson 2013: 25;\nDeasy 2019a: 284). A related suggestion is that, since mainstream\ncharacterisations of presentism, eternalism, etc., should be rejected\n(again, because of definitional worries), we should accept new\ncharacterisations of these views, given in terms of transientism or\npermanentism (e.g., Deasy 2017). On this approach, we might\ncharacterise presentism as the conjunction of transientism and a\nminimal conception of the A theory, i.e., that there is an absolute,\nobjective present moment (see Deasy 2017: 391; cf. Correia &\nRosenkranz 2015, 2020; Viebahn 2020).\n",
