    "main_text": "Related Distinctions\n5. Related Distinctions\n\nAs will be explained in section 6, the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction is a very useful and philosophically important one.\nHowever, as with all distinctions, its usefulness evaporates when it\nis confused with other related but different distinctions. This sort\nof confusion is depressingly commonplace, perhaps in virtue of an\nunfortunate tendency for philosophers to use terms like\n\u2018neutral\u2019, \u2018objective\u2019, and\n\u2018relative\u2019 without always being completely explicit about\nwhat those terms are supposed to mean. To guard against such\nconflations, this section canvasses a number of distinctions with\nwhich one might easily confuse the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction and explains how each differs from it. These distinctions\nare divided into six groups, where the distinctions are put into the\nsame group insofar as they all have the same feature(s) in common with\nthe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction.\n\nThe first of these families of distinctions consists of those that are\nlike the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction in that they are\ndrawn in terms of a relativization of the reason to the agent who has\nthe reason, but in a different way from the way in which the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction is. Only one widely employed\ndistinction clearly falls into this family: Bernard Williams\u2019\ndistinction between internal and external reasons. On Williams\u2019\naccount, a reason for acting is internal just in case it counts as a\nreason in virtue of its connection to the agent\u2019s\n\u201cmotivational set\u201d (desires, intentions, pro-attitudes,\netc.); otherwise it is external (see Williams 1981b). It is not hard\nto see how this distinction might easily be confused with the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction, for one might easily suppose\nthat internal reasons just are agent-relative ones, while external\nreasons just are agent-neutral ones. However, the distinctions are not\nthe same, for a reason may be external and still be agent-relative.\nSuppose, for example, that we accept a default principle according to\nwhich the fact that an agent\u2019s culture demands something is\nsometimes a reason to do it. Such a reason will be agent-relative in\nvirtue of the use of a free-agent variable to indicate that it is the\nagent\u2019s own culture which determines what reasons she has. Or\nconsider a default principle according to which the fact that an\naction would satisfy the agent\u2019s biological needs is sometimes a\nreason. Again, the relativization to the agent (here to the\nagent\u2019s needs) entails that such a reason is agent-relative.\nEach of the reasons grounded by either of these latter two principles\nwill be both agent-relative and external, for an agent simply\nmay not care about her culture\u2019s standards or her biological\nneeds. Hence, reasons for acting also can be both external and\nagent-relative.\n\nIn a second family of distinctions, we find distinctions that are like\nthe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction in that they are also\ndrawn in terms of the principles underwriting an agent\u2019s reasons\nfor acting, but are unlike it in that they are not drawn in terms of\ntheir relativity to the agent who has the reasons. Two main\ndistinctions fall into this family: universality/non-universality and\ngenerality/non-generality. Agent-neutrality is often confused with\nuniversality. A reason is universal insofar as any person, A,\nwho judges that one agent, B, has a reason is thereby\ncommitted to making the same judgment of anyone else, C, whom\nthey take to be in relevantly similar circumstances. So long as we\nassume reasons are associated with principles, this will mean that the\nprinciple associated with the reason will be universal in scope; that\nis to say, it will be of the form, \u201cFor all x, if\nx is an agent, then\u2026\u201d Note that this is much\nweaker than Nagel\u2019s conception of universality; even default\nprinciples employ universal quantifiers and are universal in this\nsense. Universality in this thin sense is rightly taken to be a highly\nuncontroversial, perhaps even trivial, feature of reasons. However, it\nwould of course be a mistake to infer from this that agent-neutrality\nshould be uncontroversial, for the concepts are quite different.\nAgent-relative reasons, as well as agent-neutral reasons, can satisfy\nuniversality in this sense. An egoist principle, for example, would\ntypically be understood as a universally quantified thesis according\nto which for all agents A, if a given action maximizes\nA\u2019s welfare then A ought to perform that action.\nNor, of course, is agent-neutrality the same as universality in\nNagel\u2019s somewhat stronger sense according to which whatever is a\nreason in one case must be a reason anywhere. This is obvious once it\nis made explicit, but historical attempts to derive agent-neutrality\nfrom such forms of universality encourage the conflation (see, e.g.,\nHare 1963: 112\u2013136).\n\nAgent-neutrality is also easily confused with generality, where a\nreason is general just in case the principle that underwrites it\ncontains no proper nouns or \u201crigidly designating\u201d\ndescriptions (see Kripke 1972). Like universality, generality is a\nfunction of the principles underwriting the agent\u2019s reasons.\nUpon reflection, though, it should be clear that the\ngeneral/non-general distinction simply cuts across the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction; agent-relative reasons could\nbe either general or non-general, as could agent-neutral ones. For\nexample, \u201cThe fact that God commands X-ing is a reason\nto X unless some other feature of the situation explains why\nit is not,\u201d would be non-general (assuming that\n\u2018God\u2019 is a rigid designator) yet agent-neutral, whereas,\n\u201cThe fact that God commands each person to do as her conscience\ndictates is a reason for each person to do as her conscience dictates\nunless some other feature of the situation explains why it is not a\nreason\u201d would be both non-general and agent-relative.\n\nA third family of distinctions is like the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral one in that it is drawn in terms of a\nrelativization to the agent for whom the consideration is a reason,\nbut is not drawn in terms of the principle underwriting the\nreason. Here there are two very similar distinctions that merit\ndiscussion. In fact these two distinctions are so similar that they\nmight easily be confused with one another as well as with the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral one. The first of these two distinctions\nis the distinction between \u201cdeliberator relative\u201d (DR)\nprinciples and \u201cdeliberator neutral\u201d (DN) principles (see\nPostema 1998). Unlike the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction,\nthe DR/DN distinction is not one that is drawn in terms of the form of\nthose principles themselves. Unlike agent-relativity or\nagent-neutrality, deliberator relativity and deliberator neutrality\ncannot simply be \u201cread off\u201d from an accurate statement of\nthe principles themselves. For the DR/DN distinction concerns not the\nquestion of the form of the principles, but the question of the source\nof their authority, or if one prefers, their \u201cforce.\u201d A\nprinciple\u2019s having force for a given agent is then glossed as\nbeing such that the agent must recognize the principle\u2019s\nvalidity to avoid counting as irrational. With this\nconception of force in play, the distinction is usefully characterized\nin the following way:\n\nA principle is DN iff it has force for every possible agent, which is\nto say all rational agents must recognize the principle\u2019s\nvalidity to avoid counting as irrational.\n\n\nA principle is DR iff (a) its force varies from one possible agent to\nthe next, which is to say at least some possible rational agents might\nreject the principle\u2019s validity without thereby being\nirrational, or (b) it has force for no possible agents. This is just\nthe denial of DN.\n\n\nOnce the DR/DN distinction is explicitly articulated and compared with\nthe AR/AN distinction, it is clear that they are different\ndistinctions, doing different theoretical work. The distinctions\nsimply cut across one another. A principle might have an\nagent-relative logical form, and so be agent-relative, yet have be\ndeliberator neutral given the source of its authority. Egoism, for\nexample, is an agent-relative principle, but a defender of egoism\nmight argue that a failure to recognize egoism\u2019s validity is\nsufficient for someone to count as irrational, in which case egoism is\nalso deliberator neutral. \n\nThe other distinction falling into this third family is very similar\nto the DR/DN distinction. It also concerns the force, rather than the\nform, of a practical principle. The DR/DN distinction is in terms of\nwhich principles an agent must recognize as binding on her to\navoid counting as irrational. A slightly different distinction is\nthe between principles that really are binding on everyone\n(BN\u2013\u201cbinding neutral\u201d), even if one might not\naccept their authority without thereby counting as irrational,\nand those that are not (BR\u2013\u201cbinding relative\u201d).\nDrawing the distinction may commit us to the thesis that there is a\nfairly fundamental appearance/reality distinction to be drawn even\nwith respect to principles of practical reason, so that even an\nideally rational agent could, in principle, be mistaken at a given\npoint in time about which principle(s) bind her without thereby\ncounting as irrational. At any rate, it should be clear that this\ndistinction, like the closely aligned DR/DN distinction is quite\ndifferent from the AR/AN distinction.\n\nA fourth family of distinctions with which the AR/AN distinction might\neasily be confused is of those distinctions that are like the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction in that it is drawn in terms\nof relativization, but unlike it in that it is not in terms\nof a relativization to the agent who has the reason. There is perhaps\nonly one important distinction that clearly falls into this category:\nwhat Nicholas Sturgeon has helpfully referred to as\n\u201cappraiser-relativism\u201d (Sturgeon 1994). Though this may\nnot be essential to appraiser-relativism, it is worth noting that,\nunlike agent-relativism, appraiser-relativism is typically presented\nas a semantic thesis about terms of ordinary language (as opposed to\ntechnical terms like \u2018agent-neutral\u2019), to the effect that\nthe truth value of one and the same ethical or practical judgment can\nvary from one appraiser to the next. On such views, my judgment that\nwhat Hitler did was wrong could in principle be true while another\nperson making the very same judgment in a rather different context\n(but one in which Hitler\u2019s actions, their context and\nconsequences are kept constant) could be false. By contrast, the\njudgment that there was agent-relative reason for Hitler to perform a\ngiven action will have a truth-value that is invariant across\ndifferent appraisers. Agent-relativism is a substantive view about\nwhat kinds of reasons people have, and is distinct from the semantic\nthesis of appraiser-relativism. Appraiser-relativism involves a\nrelativization to the person appraising an action, rather than a\nrelativization to the agent who might perform the action.\n\nA fifth family is of distinctions that in some sense divide reasons\ninto categories that might usefully be thought of as the\n\u201cprivate\u201d and the \u201cnon-private.\u201d In this\nrespect, they are intuitively similar to the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction, in that there is a\nrecognizable sense in which agent-relative reasons are\nprivate\u2014their status as reasons for an agent is irreducibly a\nfunction of the features of that agent as such.\nCorrespondingly, agent-neutral reasons are public in the sense that\nthis is, by definition, not true of them. At least two other\ndistinctions are usefully thought of as dividing reasons into the\ncategories of private and non-private. However, each of these two\ndistinctions mark the private/non-private division in an importantly\ndifferent sense from the one in which the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction does.\n\nThe first of these two distinctions is one between reasons that are\n\u201cessentially shared,\u201d in a somewhat technical sense, and\nthose that are not. This distinction is perhaps the one that is most\nfrequently confused with the agent-relative/agent-neutral one, and the\nphilosophical consequences are significant. As the distinction is\ntypically drawn, a reason is supposed to be \u201cessentially\nshared\u201d just in case whenever the reason is a reason for one\nagent to perform an action it is equally a reason for anyone\nto promote his performance of that action; otherwise it is not. So,\nfor example, if my reason to take a walk is essentially shared, it\nfollows that it is equally a reason for anyone to promote my taking a\nwalk. Put more quaintly, the question of whether reasons for acting\nare essentially shared is the question of whether a reason for me must\nprovide everyone else with a corresponding reason to help me do as\nthat reason recommends, insofar as they can. It is not hard to see how\nthere is a sense in which this distinction divides reasons into the\npublic and the non-public, as essentially shared reasons, unlike those\nthat are not essentially shared, provide reasons for everyone who can\npromote the state of affairs in which people act in accordance with\nthose reasons. That being \u201cshared\u201d has become a rather\ntechnical notion should be apparent, since in more ordinary terms you\nand I may both share a reason, that doing X would be pleasant\nsay, where each of our reasons provides no corresponding reasons for\nthe other.\n\nIt is also quite easy to see how this distinction might be confused\nwith the agent-relative/agent-neutral one. Suppose one embraces the\ntempting view that all reasons for acting must be\nteleological in form, which is to say that any principle\nunderwriting a reason for acting must individuate actions in terms of\nthe states of affairs that they promote. However, the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction itself should not be\nunderstood as incorporating such a highly controversial assumption,\nand the version of the distinction proposed in section IV as an\nimprovement on Nagel and Parfit therefore does not incorporate it.\nGiven the assumption of teleology, though, and given the rejection of\nholism in the theory of reasons (which Nagel\u2019s universality\nimplicitly does reject) it would indeed follow that agent-neutrality\nand being essentially shared are necessarily co-extensive, since any\nuniversal (in Nagel\u2019s sense) agent-neutral principle will then\nhave the following form:\n\n(A)\nThe fact that p\u2019s Xing would promote\nN [where N is some state of affairs which is\nspecified with no non-trivial use of \u2018p\u2019] is a\nreason for p to X.\n\n\nIt follows trivially from the supposition that all practical\nprinciples have this form that whenever one agent has reason to\npromote a state of affairs that any agent who can promote\nN will have reason to do so.\n\nHowever, the view that all reasons for acting are teleological, while\ntempting, is a substantive doctrine that one might reasonably reject.\nTeleology is certainly not a trivial feature of our understanding of\npractical reasons. To take just one example, T.M. Scanlon has recently\nargued at some length that not all reasons are teleological and that\nthe assumption that they are badly distorts our conception of\npractical reason (Scanlon 1998: 79\u2013107). So it would be a\nmistake to allow one\u2019s attraction to that substantive view to\nlead one to conflate the distinction between the\nagent-neutral/agent-relative distinction and the essentially\nshared/not essentially shared distinction. For insofar as one rejects\nthat assumption, one can very well allow that there are reasons which\nare both agent-neutral and not essentially shared. Consider,\nfor example, the following principle:\n\n (4)\n The fact that an action would be an instance of violently\nassaulting someone is a reason not to perform it unless some other\nfeature of the situation explains why it is not.\n\n\nThe reasons generated by this principle are clearly agent-neutral, but\nthey are not essentially shared, for it simply does not\nfollow from this principle that I have any reason to perform actions\nthat would reduce the total number of violent incidents (either by\nothers or myself in the future). I may very well have such further\nreasons, but they would be associated with a different principle, and\ntherefore might not be as weighty as the reasons associated\nwith the above agent-neutral principle.\n\nOn a historical note, it is perhaps no surprise that these two\ndistinctions are so often conflated. For we have seen that Nagel, the\noriginal and most influential proponent of the\nagent-neutral/agent-relative distinction, explicitly commits himself\nto the view that all reasons are teleological in form, and is driven\nby this view to conflate the two distinctions. Recall that Nagel\nembraces the following teleological conception of practical\nprinciples:\n\n[E]very reason is a predicate R such that for all persons and\nevents A, if R is true of A, then\np has prima facie reason to promote A.\n(Nagel 1970: 47)\n\n\nNagel thinks this position is just an unproblematic simplification on\nthe grounds that he treats the performance \u201cof act B as\na degenerate case of promoting the occurrence of act B\u201d\n(Nagel 1970: 47). The reason it is not merely an\nunproblematic simplification is that putting all practical principles\ninto this form robs us of the ability to say that there is\nagent-neutral reason for an agent to but no reason for her to promote\nBing, except in the admittedly degenerate sense in which\nBing is a way of promoting Bing.\n\nOf Nagel\u2019s critics, Christine Korsgaard has been most sensitive\nto the way in which he builds teleology into his view without argument\nfrom the very beginning. She notes, for example, that, \u201cNagel\ntreats all reasons as reasons to promote\nsomething\u2026Nagel is in danger of ending up with consequentialism\nbecause that is where he started\u201d (Korsgaard 1996a: 300). In\nspite of this perceptive diagnosis of Nagel\u2019s error on this\nfront, though, Korsgaard occasionally blurs the two distinctions,\nclaiming that the criterion that the reason predicate not contain a\n\u201cfree agent variable\u201d is simply a more formal way of\nsaying that these reasons are \u201ccommon property\u201d and not\n\u201cpersonal property,\u201d which on her view amounts to the\nthesis that they are essentially shared, as we have explicated that\nthesis (see Korsgaard 1996b: 276). That a philosopher perceptive\nenough to note and so accurately diagnose Nagel\u2019s mistake could\nstill blur the two distinctions is a testament to the depth of the\nconfusion about these distinctions embedded throughout the current\nphilosophical literature. For another instance of this mistake, see\nMcNaughton and Rawling 1995a as well as Dreier 1993.\n\nA second distinction falling into this larger family of distinctions\nis the distinction between reasons that are intersubjective, and those\nthat are not, where intersubjectivity is cashed out in terms of the\npossibility of an agent\u2019s successfully communicating the force\nof the reason to other agents. Korsgaard has emphasized this\ndistinction in a number of places and argued that all reasons for\nacting must be intersubjective (e.g., Korsgaard 1996b: 131\u2013166).\nIt is not hard to see how non-intersubjective reasons might plausibly\nbe thought of as private and intersubjective reasons might be thought\nof as public; hence it is not too hard to see how that distinction\nmight be confused with the agent-relative/agent-neutral one given the\ntendency to confuse that distinction with the private/public\ndistinction. Still, once intersubjectivity/non-intersubjectivity is\nexplicitly defined, it is relatively clear that it is different from\nthe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction. For the former\ndistinction is drawn in terms of communicability and the latter\ndistinction makes no reference whatsoever to communicability. Indeed,\nfor all that has been said so far, a reason might be intersubjective\nand be either agent-relative or agent-neutral. Still, it is\nsurprisingly easy to run together these two distinctions. One way this\nconfusion might arise would happen in two stages. First, one might\nconfuse the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction with the\ndistinction between reasons that are essentially shared and\nthose that are not. Since intersubjective reasons are often\ncharacterized as reasons \u201cwe can share,\u201d the\nstage is set for confusing both of those two distinctions with the\nfurther distinction between intersubjective and non-intersubjective\nreasons. For it would not be that difficult to confuse shareability\nwith being essentially shared.\n\nFinally, in the sixth family of distinctions, we find a distinction\nthat might easily be confused with the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction as a kind of historical artifact. Here we have in mind the\ndistinction between \u201creasons for an agent to do something\u201d\nand \u201creasons for something to happen.\u201d Without actually\nconfusing them himself, Nagel may have unintentionally encouraged this\nconflation in remarking, for example, that, \u201cEthics is concerned\nnot only with what should happen, but also independently with what\npeople should or may do. Neutral reasons underlie the former;\nbut relative reasons can affect the latter\u201d (Nagel 1986: 165).\nIn fact, however, it should be clear that these two distinctions are\ndifferent. The agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction concerns the\nform of a practical principle, whereas the other distinction concerns\nwhether a reason is a reason for an agent to do something or a reason\nfor something to happen. One way of making the separateness of these\ntwo distinctions especially vivid is to note that someone might\nembrace the former distinction and admit that there are both kinds of\nreasons, but reject the very notion of a \u201creason for something\nto happen\u201d as resting on an obscure, confused notion of a reason\nthat can float free of all possible agents. This is not to say that we\nshould in fact reject that notion; Wilfrid Sellars argues that a\ndistinction of this sort is an important one (see Sellars 1968:\n175\u2013229. See also Castaneda 1975, with a discussion of\nSellars\u2019s distinction). Rather, it is simply to note that it is\nnot obviously misguided to reject the very concept of a reason for\nsomething to happen, and we should leave room for someone to do this\nwithout supposing all reasons for acting are agent-relative, for that\nis simply another question. Even if I grant that all reasons must be\nreasons for someone, in that a reason presupposes a possible agent, I\ncan still hold that the principle underlying those reasons need not\nmake any non-trivial, ineliminable pronominal back-reference to that\nagent. Hence the two distinctions are different.\n\nIn sum, then, the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction shares a\nnumber of features with several other distinctions, and therefore is\neasily confused with those other distinctions. These other\ndistinctions have been broken down into six families, where those\nfamilies are divided in terms of what the distinctions in question\nhave in common with the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction.\nHaving discussed all six of these families at some length, it may be\nuseful to provide a concise review of the defining features of each\nfamily:\n\nDistinctions that are like the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction in that they are drawn in terms of a relativization to the\nagent who has the reason, but in a different way:\ninternal/external.\nDistinctions that are like the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction in that they are drawn in terms of the form of principles\nunderwriting reasons, but unlike the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction are not drawn in terms of relativization at all:\nuniversal/non-universal and\ngeneral/non-general.\nDistinctions that, like the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction involve relativization to the agent who has the reason,\nbut unlike the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction, are not drawn\nin terms of the form of the principles underwriting practical reasons\nbut instead are drawn in terms of the source of the authority of those\nprinciples: deliberator-relative/deliberator-neutral and\nbindingness-relative/\n\nbindingness-neutral.\nDistinctions that are like the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction in that they involve relativization, but that are unlike\nit in that the relativization is to the appraiser of the reason,\nrather than to the agent who has the reason:\nappraiser-relative/appraiser-neutral.\nDistinctions that are like the agent-relative/agent-neutral one in\nthat there is a sense in which they divide reasons into private and\nnon-private categories, but that do so in a different sense from the\none in which the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction does so:\nintersubjective/non-intersubjective and\nessentially-shared/not-essentially-shared.\nDistinctions with which the agent-relative agent-neutral\ndistinction might be confused primarily as a kind of historical\nartifact: reasons-for-something-to-happen/reasons-to-do.\n\n",
