    "main_text": "Feyerabend\u2019s Early Life || The Anschluss (1938)\n2.2 The Anschluss (1938)\n\nFeyerabend tells how, without falling for Adolf Hitler\u2019s\ncharisma, he appreciated Hitler\u2019s oratorial style. Austria was\nre-unified with Germany in 1938. Jewish schoolmates were treated\ndifferently, and Jewish neighbours and acquaintances started\ndisappearing. But, as usual, Feyerabend had no clear view of the\nsituation: \n\nMuch of what happened I learned only after the war, from articles,\nbooks, and television, and the events I did notice either made no\nimpression at all or affected me in a random way. I remember them and\nI can describe them, but there was no context to give them meaning and\nno aim to judge them by. (pp. 37\u20138).\n\n\nFor me the German occupation and the war that followed were an\ninconvenience, not a moral problem, and my reactions came from\naccidental moods and circumstances, not from a well-defined outlook.\n(p. 38).\n\n\nThe general impression given by his autobiography is of an imaginative\nbut fairly solitary person with no stable or well-defined personality.\nRather, his decisions and courses of action seem to have been the\nresult of a struggle between his tendency to conform and his\ncontrariness. Just as when he was a child, events happening around him\nseemed strange, distant, and out of context. It is very difficult to\nsee him identifying with any group, and he must have made an unlikely\nsoldier. \n",
