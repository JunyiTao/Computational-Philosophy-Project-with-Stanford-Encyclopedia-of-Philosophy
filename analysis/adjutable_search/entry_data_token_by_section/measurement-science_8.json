Realist Accounts of Measurement\n\nRealists about measurement maintain that measurement is best\nunderstood as the empirical estimation of an objective property or\nrelation. A few clarificatory remarks are in order with respect to\nthis characterization of measurement. First, the term\n\u201cobjective\u201d is not meant to exclude mental properties or\nrelations, which are the objects of psychological measurement. Rather,\nmeasurable properties or relations are taken to be objective inasmuch\nas they are independent of the beliefs and conventions of the humans\nperforming the measurement and of the methods used for measuring. For\nexample, a realist would argue that the ratio of the length of a given\nsolid rod to the standard meter has an objective value regardless of\nwhether and how it is measured. Second, the term\n\u201cestimation\u201d is used by realists to highlight the fact\nthat measurement results are mere approximations of true\nvalues (Trout 1998: 46). Third, according to realists, measurement is\naimed at obtaining knowledge about properties and relations, rather\nthan at assigning values directly to individual objects. This is\nsignificant because observable objects (e.g., levers, chemical\nsolutions, humans) often instantiate measurable properties and\nrelations that are not directly observable (e.g., amount of mechanical\nwork, more acidic than, intelligence). Knowledge claims about such\nproperties and relations must presuppose some background theory. By\nshifting the emphasis from objects to properties and relations,\nrealists highlight the theory-laden character of measurements.\n\nRealism about measurement should not be confused with realism about\nentities (e.g., electrons). Nor does realism about measurement\nnecessarily entail realism about properties (e.g., temperature), since\none could in principle accept only the reality of relations (e.g.,\nratios among quantities) without embracing the reality of underlying\nproperties. Nonetheless, most philosophers who have defended realism\nabout measurement have done so by arguing for some form of realism\nabout properties (Byerly and Lazara 1973; Swoyer 1987; Mundy 1987;\nTrout 1998, 2000). These realists argue that at least some measurable\nproperties exist independently of the beliefs and conventions of the\nhumans who measure them, and that the existence and structure of these\nproperties provides the best explanation for key features of\nmeasurement, including the usefulness of numbers in expressing\nmeasurement results and the reliability of measuring instruments.\n\nFor example, a typical realist about length measurement would argue\nthat the empirical regularities displayed by individual objects\u2019\nlengths when they are ordered and concatenated are best explained by\nassuming that length is an objective property that has an extensive\nstructure (Swoyer 1987: 271\u20134). That is, relations among lengths\nsuch as \u201clonger than\u201d and \u201csum of\u201d exist\nindependently of whether any objects happen to be ordered and\nconcatenated by humans, and indeed independently of whether objects of\nsome particular length happen to exist at all. The existence of an\nextensive property structure means that lengths share much of their\nstructure with the positive real numbers, and this explains the\nusefulness of the positive reals in representing lengths. Moreover, if\nmeasurable properties are analyzed in dispositional terms, it becomes\neasy to explain why some measuring instruments are reliable. For\nexample, if one assumes that a certain amount of electric current in a\nwire entails a disposition to deflect an ammeter needle by a certain\nangle, it follows that the ammeter\u2019s indications\ncounterfactually depend on the amount of electric current in the wire,\nand therefore that the ammeter is reliable (Trout 1998: 65).\n\nA different argument for realism about measurement is due to Joel\nMichell (1994, 2005), who proposes a realist theory of number based on\nthe Euclidean concept of ratio. According to Michell, numbers are\nratios between quantities, and therefore exist in space and time.\nSpecifically, real numbers are ratios between pairs of\ninfinite standard sequences, e.g., the sequence of lengths normally\ndenoted by \u201c1 meter\u201d, \u201c2 meters\u201d etc. and the\nsequence of whole multiples of the length we are trying to measure.\nMeasurement is the discovery and estimation of such ratios. An\ninteresting consequence of this empirical realism about numbers is\nthat measurement is not a representational activity, but rather the\nactivity of approximating mind-independent numbers (Michell 1994:\n400).\n\nRealist accounts of measurement are largely formulated in opposition\nto strong versions of operationalism and conventionalism, which\ndominated philosophical discussions of measurement from the 1930s\nuntil the 1960s. In addition to the drawbacks of operationalism\nalready discussed in the previous section, realists point out that\nanti-realism about measurable quantities fails to make sense of\nscientific practice. If quantities had no real values independently of\none\u2019s choice of measurement procedure, it would be difficult to\nexplain what scientists mean by \u201cmeasurement accuracy\u201d and\n\u201cmeasurement error\u201d, and why they try to increase accuracy\nand diminish error. By contrast, realists can easily make sense of the\nnotions of accuracy and error in terms of the distance between real\nand measured values (Byerly and Lazara 1973: 17\u20138; Swoyer 1987:\n239; Trout 1998: 57). A closely related point is the fact that newer\nmeasurement procedures tend to improve on the accuracy of older ones.\nIf choices of measurement procedure were merely conventional it would\nbe difficult to make sense of such progress. In addition, realism\nprovides an intuitive explanation for why different measurement\nprocedures often yield similar results, namely, because they are\nsensitive to the same facts (Swoyer 1987: 239; Trout 1998: 56).\nFinally, realists note that the construction of measurement apparatus\nand the analysis of measurement results are guided by theoretical\nassumptions concerning causal relationships among quantities. The\nability of such causal assumptions to guide measurement suggests that\nquantities are ontologically prior to the procedures that measure\n them.[14]\n\nWhile their stance towards operationalism and conventionalism is\nlargely critical, realists are more charitable in their assessment of\nmathematical theories of measurement. Brent Mundy (1987) and Chris\nSwoyer (1987) both accept the axiomatic treatment of measurement\nscales, but object to the empiricist interpretation given to the\naxioms by prominent measurement theorists like Campbell (1920) and\nErnest Nagel (1931; Cohen and Nagel 1934: Ch. 15). Rather than\ninterpreting the axioms as pertaining to concrete objects or to\nobservable relations among such objects, Mundy and Swoyer reinterpret\nthe axioms as pertaining to universal magnitudes, e.g., to the\nuniversal property of being 5 meter long rather than to the concrete\ninstantiations of that property. This construal preserves the\nintuition that statements like \u201cthe size of x is twice\nthe size of y\u201d are first and foremost about two\nsizes, and only derivatively about the objects x and\ny themselves (Mundy 1987:\n 34).[15]\n Mundy and Swoyer argue that their interpretation is more general,\nbecause it logically entails all the first-order consequences of the\nempiricist interpretation along with additional, second-order claims\nabout universal magnitudes. Moreover, under their interpretation\nmeasurement theory becomes a genuine scientific theory, with\nexplanatory hypotheses and testable predictions. Building on this\nwork, Jo Wolff (2020a) has recently proposed a novel realist account\nof quantities that relies on the Representational Theory of\nMeasurement. According to Wolff\u2019s structuralist theory of\nquantity, quantitative attributes are relational structures.\nSpecifically, an attribute is quantitative if its structure has\ntranslations that form an Archimedean ordered group. Wolff\u2019s\nfocus on translations, rather than on specific relations such as\nconcatenation and ordering, means that quantitativeness can be\nrealized in multiple ways and is not restricted to extensive\nstructures. It also means that being a quantity does not have anything\nspecial to do with numbers, as both numerical and non-numerical\nstructures can be quantitative.\n",
