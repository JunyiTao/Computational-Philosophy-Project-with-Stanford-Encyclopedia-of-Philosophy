    "main_text": "What Evolves? || The Culture Concept\n2.1 The Culture Concept\n\nWhat evolves in cultural evolution? Philosophers and other researchers\nhave answered this question differently over the last hundred or so\nyears, with few signs of consensus (Sartori 2005; Descola 2005\n[2013]). The term \u201cculture\u201d now supports a range of uses\nin philosophy (See the entry on\n culture),\n the humanities (Kuper 1999; Risjord 2012) and empirical research\n(Driscoll 2017; Feinman & Neitzel 2020; Mohr et al. 2019; Buskell\nforthcoming). This widespread use facilitates different understandings\nof the extension of \u201cculture\u201d and the kinds of processes\nthat might change it.\n\nOne important contrast distinguishes distinct levels of\ncultural phenomena. Though it is quite common to refer to both\nindividual- and group-level phenomena as \u201cculture\u201d, it\nfrequently leads to confusion. For example, it can lead to conflation\nof talk about traits\u2014things actually or\npossibly possessed by individuals, such as the ability to\nmake a Cornish pasty or to speak the Cornish language\u2014and\n\u201cthe culture\u201d of a group, as when one speaks of\n\u201cCornish culture\u201d.\n\nCutting across the distinction in levels are distinct\npossible roles for \u201cculture\u201d (Risjord 2012).\n\u201cCulture\u201d might be a medium for carrying content; the\nbackground conditions needed for meaningful practices to be undertaken\n(Bourdieu 1972 [1977]; Ortner 1984; Rouse 2007); or the strategies\n(behaviours, technologies) adopted to deal with local ecological\nproblems (White 1949; Steward 1955). Positions might be cut finer\nstill: researchers differ on the character of the content carried, on\nthe nature of practices, and the set of strategies that matter\n(Risjord 2012).\n\nThere is, then, considerable variation in how the culture concept is\ndefined when one looks across disparate disciplines. If one focuses on\nthe community of researchers in cultural evolution, however, one finds\nthat Richerson and Boyd\u2019s (2005) definition of culture is fairly\ntypical. Culture, they say, is\n\n\ninformation capable of affecting individuals\u2019 behavior that they\nacquire from other members of their species through teaching,\nimitation, and other forms of social learning. (Richerson & Boyd\n2005: 5)\n\n\nThat is, \u201cculture\u201d is an individual-level phenomenon,\ncontent (\u201cinformation\u201d) is carried by a wide range of\nmaterial vehicles, and this content is communicated by a range of\ntransmission mechanisms. Though cultural evolutionary researchers\nmight talk about culture at the group-level, this tends to be an\naggregate measure or generic description of the\ncultural information held by individuals in group, where the group\nitself is delineated by other means (for instance, by ethnic identity,\ne.g., Richerson et al. 2016; Henrich 2020. See: Buskell forthcoming\nfor discussion).\n\nAdopting \u201cinformation\u201d as the underlying basis of culture\nbrings both risks and benefits (see related entries on\n information,\n and\n biological information).\n On the negative side, it is not clear how we are to understand the\nconcept of information. Boyd and Richerson, for example, give what\nmight look like a definition when they write that, by\n\u201cinformation\u201d, they mean\n\n\nany kind of mental state, conscious or not, that is acquired or\nmodified by social learning and affects behavior. (Richerson &\nBoyd 2005: 5)\n\n\nBut they later state that \u201csome cultural information is stored\nin artefacts\u201d (2005: 61), suggesting their comments are intended\nas a description of where most cultural information is to be found,\nand not as a definition of what cultural information is. When they do\noffer a definition, it invites obvious counterexamples. So, for\ninstance, in early work they write that information is\n\u201csomething which has the property that energetically minor\ncauses have energetically major effects\u201d (Boyd & Richerson\n1985: 35). But the long training scientists undertake, and the large\namount of resources they might consume, to produce data and theories\n(often, in the form of written inscriptions) shows how highly\nenergetic causes can generate energetically minor effects. Nor is it\nclear what it means for some causal contributor to development to\ncount as an information-bearer, rather than some other kind of\ndevelopmental participant, such as an information-reader, or a\nbackground condition for information transfer (Oyama 1985 [2000];\nGriffiths 2001).\n\nSeen in a more positive light, the plasticity of the term supports a\nwide range of stipulative definitions of information (Lewens 2015).\nThese in turn facilitate an eclectic use of models and explanatory\ntools. Framing cultural evolution in informational terms might also\nsupport further borrowing from the theoretical study of biology. For\nexample, what are known are \u201cmajor evolutionary\ntransitions\u201d are sometimes characterized in terms of significant\nchanges to the way inherited information is stored, transmitted or\ninterpreted. In their pioneering discussion of these transitions,\nMaynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry give examples including the initial\narrival of the genetic code, the advent of sexual reproduction, and\nepigenetic inheritance. They also cite the development of language as\na further example of an informational transition, illustrating the\npotential for an informational account of culture itself to integrate\nwith broader discussion in theoretical biology (Maynard Smith &\nSzathm\u00e1ry 1995; Jablonka & Lamb 2006; Calcott &\nSterelny 2011)\u2014a potential that is beginning to be actualized\n(e.g., Waring & Wood 2021).\n",
