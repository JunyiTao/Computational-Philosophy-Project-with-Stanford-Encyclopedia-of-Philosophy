    "main_text": "Critical Concepts\n3. Critical Concepts\n\nThe basic concepts of Frankfurt School critical theory \u2013 such as\nalienation, reification, ideology, but also emancipation \u2013 are\nexpressive of the specific methodology, or set of methodologies, that\ncritical theorists in this tradition employ. As explained in the\nprevious section, critical theory in this tradition proceeds in an\nimmanent way, and this implies that its concepts are both developed\nfrom within a certain social constellation and seek to go beyond the\nself-understanding characteristic of this constellation, they are both\ndescriptive and evaluative, and they exemplify the unity of analysis\nand critique inherited from Marx. While some concepts are primarily\n\u201canticipatory-utopian\u201d (like emancipation) and others\nprimarily \u201cexplanatory-diagnostic\u201d (like alienation,\nreification, and ideology, as obstacles to emancipation) (Benhabib\n1986), they are all \u201cthick concepts\u201d whose descriptive\ncontent is irreducibly social-theoretically as well as evaluatively\nloaded.\n\nIn addition, some of the critical concepts developed by Frankfurt\nSchool authors \u2013 again alienation, reification and ideology are\nthe clearest examples \u2013 point to second-order phenomena. In\ncontrast to substantial first-order injustices, these concepts seek to\ncritically diagnose what happens when unjust (or exploitative or\noppressive) social relations are not experienced as unjust (or\nexploitative or oppressive) but are accepted as legitimate or natural,\nor if they are intuitively experienced but not explicitly recognized\nas such, or recognized but not adequately interpreted and articulated.\nThese concepts pick out social phenomena that are often ignored by\nmore mainstream approaches in moral and political philosophy that\nfocus on the moral status of the individual and their actions, or the\nlegitimacy of institutional arrangements, to the neglect of the domain\nof the social, with its distinct structure, dynamics, and challenges\n(see, e.g., Honneth 2000, Ch. 1, Zurn 2011, Neuhouser 2022, Ch. 1).\nThe following subsections introduce four key concepts that exemplify\nboth the critical methodologies discussed in the previous section and\nthe substantial social-theoretical and diagnostic contributions to our\nunderstanding of contemporary society that Frankfurt School critical\ntheory aspires to. There are of course other concepts used by critical\ntheorists \u2013 from normativity, justice, and autonomy to power,\ndomination, and oppression \u2013 but the focus here is on concepts\nless widely discussed in other traditions or to which Frankfurt School\ntheorists have made distinctive contributions.\n",
