Brentano\u2019s Theory of Mind\n\nBrentano\u2019s main goal was to lay the basis for a scientific\npsychology, which he defines as\u00a0\u201cthe science of mental\nphenomena\u201d (PES, 14) [\u201cWissenschaft von den\npsychischen Erscheinungen\u201d]. In order to give flesh to this\ndefinition of the discipline, he provides a more detailed\ncharacterization of mental phenomena. He proposes six criteria to\ndistinguish mental from physical phenomena (PES 61\u201377),\nthe most important of which are: (i) mental phenomena are the\nexclusive object of inner perception, (ii) they always appear\nas a unity, and (iii) they are always intentionally directed\ntowards an object. (The other three criteria are: psychological\nphenomena \u2013 and only those \u2013 are presentations or\nphenomena based upon presentations; they seem to have no spatial\nextension; and have not only intentional, but also actual existence.)\nI will discuss the first two criteria in the next sub-section, and the\nthird in a separate sub-section below. \n",
