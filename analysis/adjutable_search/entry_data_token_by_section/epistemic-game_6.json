    "main_text": "Game Models\n2. Game Models\nA model of a game is a structure that represents the\ninformational context of a given play of the game. The states, or\npossible worlds, in a game model describe a possible play of the\ngame and the specific information that influenced the\nplayers\u2019 choices (which may be different at each state). This\nincludes each player\u2019s \u201cknowledge\u201d of her own choice\nand opinions about the choices and \u201cbeliefs\u201d of her\nopponents. A key challenge when constructing a model of a game is how\nto represent the different informational attitudes of the\nplayers. Researchers interested in the foundation of decision theory,\nepistemic and doxastic logic and, more recently, formal\nepistemology have developed many different formal models that can\ndescribe the many varieties of informational attitudes important for\nassessing the choice of a rational agent in a decision- or\ngame-theoretic situation.\nAfter discussing some general issues that arise when describing the\ninformational context of a game, we introduce the two main types of\nmodels that have been used to describe the players\u2019 beliefs (and\nother informational attitudes) in a game situation: type\nspaces (Harsanyi 1967\u201368; Siniscalchi 2008) and the\nso-called Aumann- or Kripke-structures (Aumann\n1999a; Fagin, Halpern, Moses, & Vardi 1995). Although these two\napproaches have much in common, there are some important differences\nwhich we highlight below. A second, more fundamental, distinction\nfound in the literature is between \u201cquantitative\u201d\nstructures, representing \u201cgraded\u201d attitudes (typically via\nprobability distributions), and \u201cqualitative\u201d structures\nrepresenting \u201call out\u201d attitudes. Kripke structures are\noften associated with the former, and type spaces with the latter, but\nthis is not a strict classification.\n",
