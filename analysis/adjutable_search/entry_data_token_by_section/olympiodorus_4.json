    "main_text": "Influence\n5. Influence\n\n\nThe teaching of philosophy did not cease with the death of\nOlympiodorus. He evidently had intelligent pupils who devoted\nthemselves to philosophy in a professional way. Whether they were\npagans or Christians is not entirely clear, but their commentaries\nwere passed around under such names as David and Elias. We can tell\nthat they were influenced by Olympiodorus, not only because they refer\nto him, but also because they adopt his pedagogical method of dividing\ntheir lectures into the\u00f4riai and lexeis. The\nsame goes for Stephanus of Alexandria, who taught philosophy in\nConstantinople at the beginning of the 7th century.\n\n\nOlympiodorus\u2019 wider influence is somewhat less tangible than that of\nthe other great Alexandrians. The Syrians and the Arabs certainly knew\nand read him, but not extensively. Neither did the Latin west. The\ncommentary on the Categories has come down to us in only one\nmanuscript (Codex Mutinensi 69), and there are only a handful\nof manuscripts of the Meteorology commentary.  Manuscripts of\nhis commentaries on Plato are equally rare, with the exception of\nthose containing the Phaedo commentary. Yet, to medieval\nalchemists Olympiodorus\u2019 illustrious name sounded arcane enough to\ndeserve induction into the fictitious canon of ancient alchemists.\n",
