    "main_text": "Contemporary Approaches and Debates || Feminist Engagements with Liberalism and Neoliberalism\n2.1 Feminist Engagements with Liberalism and Neoliberalism\n\nLiberal feminism\n remains a strong current in feminist political thought. Following\nliberalism\u2019s focus on freedom and equality, liberal\nfeminism\u2019s primary concern is to protect and enhance\nwomen\u2019s personal and political autonomy, the first being the\nfreedom to live one\u2019s life as one chooses and the second being\nthe freedom to help decide the direction of the political community.\nThis follows from Enlightenment liberalism\u2019s core norm of equal\nrespect for personhood, where personhood is tied to moral equality, or\nthe equal worth of persons as moral choosers (Nussbaum 1999a). This\napproach was invigorated with the publication of John Rawls\u2019s\nA Theory of Justice (1971) and subsequently his Political\nLiberalism (1993). Susan Moller Okin (1989, 1979, 1999), Eva\nKittay (1999), Martha Nussbaum (2006), and Amy Baehr (2017) have used\nRawls\u2019s work productively to extend his theory to attend to\nwomen\u2019s concerns.\n\nPerhaps more than any other approach, liberal feminist theory\nparallels developments in liberal feminist activism. While feminist\nactivists have waged legal and political battles to criminalize, as\njust one example, violence against women (which previously, in marital\nrelations, hadn\u2019t been considered a crime), feminist political\nphilosophers who have engaged the liberal lexicon have shown how the\ndistinction between private and public realms has served to uphold\nmale domination of women by rendering power relations within the\nhousehold as \u201cnatural\u201d and immune from political\nregulation. Such political philosophy uncovers how seemingly innocuous\nand \u201ccommonsensical\u201d categories have covert power agendas.\nFor instance, Clare Chambers has critiqued the institution of\nmarriage, arguing that it violates liberal political principles of\nequality and liberty (Chambers 2017a). Feminist critiques of the\npublic/private split supported legal advances that finally led in the\n1980s to the criminalization in the United States of spousal rape\n(Sigler & Haygood 1988). Efforts to politicize the private sphere\nhave also challenged the capitalist economic system that relies on\nwomen\u2019s unpaid labor. As the entry on\n feminist perspectives on class and work\n explains, scholars like Silvia Federici have argued that\nwomen\u2019s unpaid housework and reproductive labor is essential to\nthe social reproduction of capitalism that exploits women. The\n\u201cwages for housework\u201d movement led by scholar-activists\nlike Federici is an attempt to demand remuneration for women\u2019s\nunpaid work (Federici 2012, 2021; more on this Marxist feminist\nlineage in\n section 2.3).\n Reproductive justice, pornography, and sex work are yet more issues\nof convergence for feminist proponents and critics of liberalism alike\n(see the section on Reproductive Rights in the entry on\n feminist philosophy of law;\n Altman & Watson 2019; Watson & Flanigan 2020). While the U.S.\nlegal tradition has typically grounded abortion rights in the right to\nprivacy, feminist political philosophers such as Shatema Threadcraft\n(2016) have understood reproductive justice as more fundamentally\nhaving to do with the freedom to choose one\u2019s destiny. As such,\nit is connected to the history of other struggles for race and gender\nequality in earlier eras.\n\nCarole Pateman and Charles Mills have worked within the liberal\ntradition to show the limits and faults of social contract theory, and\nEnlightenment liberalism more broadly, for women and people of color.\nTheir jointly authored book, Contract & Domination,\nlevels a devastating critique against systems of sexual and racial\ndomination. This work engages and critiques some of the most dominant\nstrains of political philosophy. Martha Nussbaum has defended\nliberalism from some of its critics, arguing that the most appealing\nversions of liberalism successfully avoid feminist criticisms that\nliberalism is overly individualistic, abstract, and rationalist\n(Nussbaum 1999a). She does however take seriously two deep and\nunresolved problems within liberalism \u201cexposed by feminist\nthinkers\u201d: (1) the fact of dependency and the need for care and\n(2) gender inequality and the family (Nussbaum 2004). With respect to\ndependency\u2014the reality of human dependency and thus the need for\ncare throughout the course of life\u2014Asha Bhandary (2020) has\ndeveloped a Rawlsian social contract framework to expose and address\nsystemic inequalities in who receives and provides care (see also\nBhandary & Baehr [eds] 2021 and\n section 2.5\n below). With respect to the second issue, which deals with the social\ninstitution of the family as a site of gender hierarchy and\noppression, Marxist, socialist, and materialist feminists have\nanalyzed the material conditions under which these social arrangements\n(the family and gender hierarchy) have developed. These feminists\ntypically critique liberalism for entrenching social arrangements\n(such as the public/private split and the system of wage labor) that\narise with capitalism and marginalize and disempower women as a social\ngroup (see\n section 2.3\n below).\n\nAs other feminist critics have argued, many of the central categories\nof liberalism occlude women\u2019s lived concerns. For example, the\nright to privacy coveted by classical liberals is a major source of\ncontention for feminists: the private realm, understood as a domain\nfree from state intervention, has historically been the domain where\nwomen and children have experienced the bulk of everyday forms of\noppression. The liberal private/public distinction sequesters the\nprivate sphere, and any harm that may occur there to women, away from\npolitical scrutiny (Pateman 1988). Other feminist critics note that\nliberalism continues to treat as unproblematic concepts that theorists\nin the 1990s and since have problematized, such as \u201cwoman\u201d\nas a stable and identifiable category and the univocity of the self\nunderlying self-rule or autonomy. Decolonial feminists like\nMar\u00eda Lugones have exposed the Eurocentric foundations of this\nview of the self (Lugones 2003; see also\n section 2.7).\n While Mari Matsuda develops a feminist critique of the methodological\nabstraction in liberal theories such as Rawls\u2019 A Theory of\nJustice (Matsuda 1986), others (such as Zerilli 2009) have argued\nthat the universal values that liberal feminists such as Okin\ninvoked were really expanded particulars, with liberal theorists\nmistaking their ethnocentrically derived values as universal ones. In\nthis vein, Falguni Sheth, focusing on the treatment of Muslim women in\nthe contemporary United States, argues that despite liberal claims to\nsecular neutrality, liberal states actively exclude and discriminate\nagainst racialized and marginalized populations (Sheth 2022).\n\nBeyond liberal feminism, contemporary feminist philosophers have led\nthe way in theorizing and critiquing what is known as neoliberalism,\nespecially the ways that neoliberal social and economic forces impact\nthe lives of women. On Wendy Brown\u2019s account (2015),\nneoliberalism refers to a set of relations between state, society, and\nsubjects that mimics and reinforces radical free-market ideals in the\neconomy. These forces, Brown argues, undermine liberal democratic\ncitizenship, public institutions, and popular sovereignty. Nancy\nFraser (2013), Jodi Dean (2009), Bonnie Honig (2017) and Judith Butler\n(2015) join Brown in asking whether democracy\u2014or \u201cthe\ndemos\u201d\u2014can be sustained under neoliberal conditions of\nrapidly increasing economic precariousness and diminishing social and\npolitical resources for resistance. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Anderson asks\nhow putatively positive values like \u201cwork ethic\u201d have\nbecome central to the moral and physical exploitation of workers under\nneoliberalism.\n",
