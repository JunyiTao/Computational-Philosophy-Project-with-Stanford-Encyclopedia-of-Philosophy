    "main_text": "John Duns Scotus and the Role of Concepts\n8. Cardinal Cajetan: A New Approach\n\nThomists\u2019 discussions of analogy from the beginning of the fourteenth\ncentury onward are dominated by controversy with the arguments of\nScotus and the Scotists. Beginning with the fifteenth-century Thomist John\nCapreolus and culminating with the fifteenth-sixteenth century Thomist Thomas de\nvio Cajetan, a set of influential Thomists turned to the threefold\ndivision of analogy in Thomas Aquinas\u2019s commentary on\nthe\u00a0Sentences\u00a0as providing the key for resolving a\nset of questions inspired by Scotus about (a) the number\nof\u00a0rationes,\u00a0intentiones, or concepts\ninvolved in analogy, (b) the distinction between logical and\nmetaphysical univocity and analogy, and (c) how analogy is compatible\nwith valid syllogistic demonstration. The approach of these Thomists\nmarks a departure from earlier Thomists, such as Hervaeus Natalis, and\narguably a departure from the later works of Thomas Aquinas himself\n(such as the Summa Contra Gentiles, De Potentia, and\nSumma Theologiae). Montagnes and Wippel have argued strongly\nthat these fifteenth-sixteenth century Thomists depart from the mature position\nof Aquinas. Hochschild has argued to the contrary. McInerny argued\nthat Cajetan\u00a0not only misses the mark on the mature thought of\nAquinas, but even misinterprets Aquinas\u2019s early commentary on the\nSentences.\u00a0Dewan has contended that McInerny\u2019s criticism\nof Cajetan\u00a0relies both on overlooking direct statements by\nAquinas in the commentary on the\u00a0Sentences\u00a0passage\nin question and on omissions of words and phrases from the passage\nthat support Cajetan\u2019s interpretation.\n\nThe commentary on the Sentences\u00a0passage in question\ndivides analogy into: (1) the analogous according\nto\u00a0intentio\u00a0(\u201cintentio\u201d is a synonym\nfor\u00a0ratio\u00a0or concept), but not according\nto\u00a0esse (act of being); (2) the analogous according\nto\u00a0esse, but not according to\u00a0intentio;\nand (3) the analogous both according\nto\u00a0intentio\u00a0and according to\u00a0esse.\nAquinas offers healthy as belonging to an animal, to urine, and to\nmedicine as an example of the first kind of analogy; body as belonging\nto corruptible and incorruptible bodies as an example of the second\nkind of analogy \u2014 which Aquinas says is not a case of analogy from the\nperspective of logic but is analogy\u00a0from the perspective of\nmetaphysics and physics; and, finally, being, truth, and goodness as\nexamples of the third kind of analogy. Capreolus and Cajetan affirm\nthat the first kind of analogy (analogy of attribution) requires more\nthan one\u00a0ratio\u00a0or concept \u2014 e.g., one for the\nhealthiness of an animal; another for the healthiness of urine;\nanother for the healthiness of medicine; etc. They maintain that this\ndiversity of\u00a0rationes prevents a name that is being said\nby analogy in this way from appearing in a valid syllogistic\ndemonstration. By contrast, names said by analogy in the second way\nhave only one\u00a0ratio\u00a0and present no obstacle to\ndemonstrative reasoning. Indeed, names said by analogy in the second\nway are not even considered analogous but univocal from the\nperspective of logic, which considers\nthe\u00a0ratio\u00a0apart from\nits\u00a0esse\u00a0rather\nthan\u00a0the\u00a0ratio\u00a0together with\nits\u00a0esse. Names said by analogy in the third way have\none\u00a0ratio\u00a0in a qualified sense of unity. As Cajetan\nexplains it, strictly speaking the different analogates have\ndiverse\u00a0rationes, but, inasmuch as the diverse\nanalogates in the third mode of analogy are proportionally similar to\none another, it follows that the\u00a0ratio\u00a0of one\nis\u00a0proportionally one and the same as\nthe\u00a0ratio\u00a0of the other. Cajetan draws the further\ninference that valid demonstration can proceed on the basis of this\nkind of analogy provided that what is demonstrated from one analogate\nabout another is demonstrated about the other only insofar as the\nanalogates are proportionally similar. Accordingly, Cajetan claims\nthat names said by analogy in the third way (which Cajetan calls\nanalogy of proper proportionality) meet John Duns Scotus\u2019s conditions\nfor univocity: they have sufficient unity to ground a contradiction\nand to serve as a middle term in a syllogism without the fallacy of\nequivocation.\u00a0\n\nThe marriage that Capreolus makes implicitly and that Cajetan makes\nexplicitly between the third mode of analogy in\nAquinas\u2019s\u00a0commentary on the Sentences\u00a0and analogy\nof proportionality in Aquinas\u2019s\u00a0De Veritate\u00a0plays a\nkey role in their approach to defending analogy against Scotist\nobjections, and it is one of several points on which modern\nscholarship has taken Cajetan in particular to task as an interpreter\nof the thought of Thomas Aquinas. Cajetan is frequently criticised in\nmodern scholarship for\u00a0his claim that analogy of proportionality\nis the only mode of analogy that is analogy in the strict sense\n(proprie) and the other modes of analogy are only analogy in\na looser sense (abusive). This claim is not original to\nCajetan, and can be found in the writings of the late thirteenth to early\nfourteenth century Thomist, Thomas Sutton.\u00a0Cajetan\u2019s contemporary\nThomist critics, such as Francis Sylvester of Ferrara and Sylvester\nMazzolini Prierias\u00a0dispute Cajetan\u2019s interpretation of analogy of\nproper proportionality and its relationship to other modes of analogy.\nFrancis Sylvester goes so far as to propose that analogy of\nproportionality is a subdivision\u00a0of a subdivision of analogy of\nattribution. Tavuzzi has called attention to several other ways that\nCajetan\u2019s contemporary Thomists divided up the modes of analogy in\nopposition to Cajetan\u2019s threefold division.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhatever the merits of the writings of Capreolus and Cajetan\u00a0on\nanalogy are for their insight into the position of Thomas Aquinas,\ntheir writings and the writings of their Thomist and Scotist critics\noffer great insight into the ongoing philosophical reflection of the\nmedieval Aristotelian tradition in the logic, metaphysics, and\nepistemology of analogy.\u00a0\n",
