    "main_text": "\n\nTraditionally philosophical discussions on moral responsibility have\nfocused on the human components of moral action. Accounts of how to\nascribe moral responsibility usually describe human agents performing\nactions that have well-defined, direct consequences. In today\u2019s\nincreasingly technological society, however, human activity cannot be\nproperly understood without making reference to technological\nartifacts, which complicates the ascription of moral responsibility\n(Jonas 1984; Doorn & van de Poel\n 2012).[1]\n As we interact with and through these artifacts, they affect the\ndecisions that we make and how we make them (Latour 1992, Verbeek\n2021). They persuade, facilitate and enable particular human cognitive\nprocesses, actions or attitudes, while constraining, discouraging and\ninhibiting others. For instance, internet search engines prioritize\nand present information in a particular order, thereby influencing\nwhat internet users get to see. As Verbeek points out, such\ntechnological artifacts are \u201cactive mediators\u201d that\n\u201cactively co-shape people\u2019s being in the world: their\nperception and actions, experience and existence\u201d (2006, p.\n364). As active mediators, they are a key part of human action and as\na result they challenge conventional notions of moral responsibility\nthat do not account for the active role of technology (Jonas 1984;\nJohnson 2001; Swierstra and Waelbers 2012).\n\nComputing presents a particular case for understanding the role of\ntechnology in moral responsibility. As computer technologies have\nbecome a more integral part of daily activities, automate more\ndecision-making processes and continue to transform the way people\ncommunicate and relate to each other, they have further complicated\nthe already problematic tasks of attributing moral responsibility. The\ngrowing pervasiveness of computer technologies in everyday life, the\ngrowing complexities of these technologies and the new possibilities\nthat they provide raise new kinds of questions: who is responsible for\nthe information published on the Internet? To what extent and for what\nperiod of time are developers of computer technologies accountable for\nuntoward consequences of their products? And as computer technologies\nbecome more complex and behave increasingly autonomous can or should\nhumans still be held responsible for the behavior of these\ntechnologies?\n\nThis entry will first look at the challenges that computing poses to\nconventional notions of moral responsibility. The discussion will then\nreview two different ways in which various authors have addressed\nthese challenges: 1) by reconsidering the idea of moral agency and 2)\nby rethinking the concept of moral responsibility itself.\n",
