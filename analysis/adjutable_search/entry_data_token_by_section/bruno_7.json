Bruno\u2019s Afterlife\n\nBruno\u2019s philosophy, his views on religion and his execution\nearned him notoriety. \u201cIt is reasonable to denounce\nBruno\u201d, wrote the French mathematician, philosopher and\ntheologian Marin Mersenne (1588\u20131648), \u201cas one of the most\nevil men that the earth has ever borne\u201d (Mersenne 1624\n[2005, 173]). What perturbed Mersenne and many others, including\nDescartes, was not so much Bruno\u2019s doctrines concerning the\nearth\u2019s mobility, the elemental homogeneity of the universe, the\nplurality of worlds and other cosmological innovations, but rather the\nunderlying doctrine of the World Soul and its perceived corollaries:\npantheism, demonology, magic, metempsychosis, the claim that\nGod\u2019s absolute power necessitated an infinite product, the\nessential identity of human, plant and animal souls, the elimination\nof individual responsibility, denial of miracles\u2014in short,\n\u201catheism\u201d.\n\nDemonizing Bruno lent him, however, a certain fascination. To his\ndismay, Mersenne observed that some of his compatriots amused\nthemselves by reading his On the Cause, the Principle and the\nOne. During the course of the seventeenth century, his ideas\ncontinued to appeal to libertines, Rosicrucians and other unorthodox\nthinkers, despite, or perhaps because of, the censures of conventional\ntheologians and philosophers. In his Oculus sidereus\n(Starry Gaze), published at Danzig in 1644, the Rosicrucian\nAbraham von Franckenberg (1593\u20131652), a pupil of Jacob\nB\u00f6hme, included a synopsis, the first to be printed, of De\nimmenso (originally published in 1591) relating its ideas to\nthose of ancient and Renaissance authors. Bruno\u2019s space, wrote\nFranckenberg, was the Kabbalists\u2019 \u201cGod as space\u201d,\ntheir Ensoph, the first of the ten Sephiroth (Ricci 1990,\n137\u2013152). In England and on the Continent, John Toland\nchampioned Bruno\u2019s philosophy, incurring the disapproval of\nLeibniz and others. Leibniz\u2019s early enthusiasm for Bruno had worn off; and the striking similarities between aspects of Leibniz\u2019s monadology and Bruno\u2019s doctrine of minims are probably attributable to the sources and philosophical interests that they shared in common, rather than direct influence (Brown 2002). Among the seventeenth-century champions of\nheliocentricism, Johannes Kepler, averse though he was to\nBruno\u2019s suggestion that the universe was infinite and his\napparent conflation of God and matter, engaged circumspectly with his\ncosmological ideas on several occasions, particularly through the\nintermediary of the Imperial Counsellor to Rudolph II, Wacker von\nWackenfels, an enthusiast of Bruno\u2019s cosmology (Ricci 1990,\n68\u201379; Granada 2008). In private conversation, Kepler, the newly\nappointed Imperial Mathematician, chided Galileo for not having\nacknowledged the contribution that others, including Bruno and\nhimself, had made to the novelties recorded in his\nStarry Messenger, published in 1610 (Hasdale 1610).\n\nInterest in Bruno\u2019s philosophy remained, nevertheless, sporadic.\nCopies of his works were hard to come by and, for the most part, the\nideas in them remained curiosities, outlined in encyclopedias and\nhistories of philosophy, such as those of Pierre Bayle and J. J.\nBrucker, with cautionary remarks about his extravagant, wayward,\ngenius. More than any other philosopher, Bruno proved \u201cthat\noften the greater the power of intellect, the less judgement there\nis\u201d (Brucker 1776\u201377: IV.2, 30). \u201cGold\u201d there\nwas to be discovered, but it lay concealed within the\n\u201cdung\u201d of his confused thinking (ibid., 31). What changed\nBruno\u2019s fortunes decisively was the advent of\n\u201cSpinozism\u201d. The similarities between Bruno\u2019s and\nSpinoza\u2019s substance monism had long been noticed. Bayle, no\nadmirer of Spinoza, pointed them out, as did Mathurin Veyssi\u00e8re\nde Lacroze by way of denigrating Bruno as an \u201catheist\u201d\n(Veyssi\u00e8re de Lacroz 1711, 284\u2013325). Brucker conceded that\nthere were some resemblances but concluded that Bruno did not merit\nthe charge of \u201cSpinozism\u201d (ibid., 52), arguing that, for\nBruno, the universe emanated from, rather than was identical with, God\n(see\n Section 5).\nThen, spectacularly, in the second half the eighteenth century Bruno\npassed from being a heinous atheist to, in Herder\u2019s estimation,\nsomeone comparable to, indeed \u201cundoubtedly still more\ndivine\u201d than St John (McFarland 1969, 77). The key moment was\nthe publication in 1785 of F. H. Jacobi\u2019s On the Doctrine of\nSpinoza in Letters to Herr Moses Mendelssohn, in which Jacobi,\nwithout Mendelssohn\u2019s consent, published an exchange of letters\nbetween them concerning Lessing\u2019s alleged\n\u201cSpinozism\u201d and Spinoza\u2019s philosophy more generally.\nJacobi, an opponent of Enlightenment rationalism, praised\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophy, in the \u201cpurified\u201d form\nproposed by some exponents, as an exemplary manifestation of what pure\nreason, left to its own devices, could achieve. Equally, however, it\nmanifested the limitations of reason, more specifically rational\ntheism. It led essentially to materialism, fatalism and atheism. In\n1789, Jacobi issued an expanded edition of his work, which included,\nin a new preface, a brief discussion of Bruno and his monism and, in\nan appendix, a German paraphrase of On the Cause, the Principle\nand the One together with an extended quotation from the second\ndialogue in the original Italian. His purpose in combining Spinoza and\nBruno was to provide \u201ca summa of the philosophy of the\n\u1f13\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1f71\u03bd\u201d, a reference\nto Lessing\u2019s \u201cpantheist\u201d theology as well as an\nallusion to Heraclitus\u2019s monism. \u201cIt was difficult to give\na purer or better explained summary of pantheism\u201d than that\nprovided by this \u201cdark man\u201d, Giordano Bruno (Jacobi 1789,\nIX, XI).\n\nIn the ensuing intellectual uproar, the Pantheismusstreit\n(\u201cPantheism controversy\u201d) that dominated late eighteenth-\nand early nineteenth-century German philosophy, Bruno emerged as the\ngreat precursor of Spinoza and a major philosopher in his own right.\nSpinoza and Spinozists had followed in Bruno\u2019s footsteps,\nconcluded F. W. J. Schelling, who thereupon wrote a dialogue,\nBruno or On the Divine and Natural Principle of Things\n(1802), setting out a Platonized form of Spinozism. Goethe, writing to\nSchiller, while expressing reservations, confided that what he\nunderstood or thought he understood of the dialogue was in tune with\nhis \u201cinnermost convictions\u201d (McFarland 1969, 247). Many\nothers concurred, among them Hegel, who, in his Lectures on the History of Philosophy (1827\u201328), praised Bruno\u2019s\nwritings, fantastic and confused though they might be, for displaying\n\u201ca sense of indwelling spirit\u201d. Coleridge was a steadfast\nadmirer, even in later life, when his philosophical and religious\nviews were less consonant with Bruno\u2019s. \u201cThis man\u201d,\nhe wrote in 1819, \u201cthough a pantheist, was religious\u201d\n(Gatti 2011, 203). This new found enthusiasm led to the publication of\neditions of Bruno\u2019s Italian and Latin works in Germany by Adolph\nWagner (1830) and August Friedrich Gfr\u00f6rer (1836) respectively,\nthe first editions of his works in their original languages since the\nmid-seventeenth century.\n\nThis European revival was the setting for Bruno\u2019s rehabilitation\nin Italy. Hegel, Michelet and others had portrayed the period that we\nnow know, thanks to Michelet, as the Renaissance and Reformation as\nthe birthplace of modernity. This was manifest above all, though not\nexclusively, through the artistic, literary and philosophical\nachievements of the period, which had broken the Roman Catholic\nChurch\u2019s dominance in spiritual and cultural concerns. For many,\nthe most conspicuous being Jacob Burckhardt in The Civilization of\nthe Renaissance in Italy (1860), the honor for this rupture\nbelonged principally to the Italians, \u201cthe first born among the\nsons of modern Europe\u201d (pt 2, ch. 1). Sentiments of these kinds were welcome\nin Italy. Pride in its cultural achievements fed into the crescendo of\nnationalist fervour\u2014the \u201cRisorgimento\u201d, leading\neventually to the proclamation of Italy as an independent kingdom in\n1861\u2014and mounting hostility in some circles towards the Roman\nCatholic Church. The Church had been blamed for the peninsula\u2019s\npolitical fragmentation and intellectual atrophy ever since the\nCounter-Reformation.\n\nCircumstances could scarcely have been more propitious for heterodox\nRenaissance thinkers such as Telesio, Campanella, Galileo Galilei and,\nabove all, Bruno. For many Italians, his philosophy, heroic defiance\nof ecclesiastical authority and execution exemplified the long\nstruggle to free philosophy from the trammels of revealed\nreligion. Popular versions of Bruno\u2019s life and death likened him\nto Socrates, Christ or, nearer home, martyrs of the Risorgimento. This\nadulation found its most visible expression in the monumental bronze\nstatue, designed by the sculptor Ettore Ferrari, a mason and later\nGrand Master of the masonic lodge, the Grande Oriente d\u2019Italia,\nlocated in Rome. In 1889, in the face of tooth-and-nail opposition\nfrom the Vatican, the statue was erected, glaring directly towards the\nHoly See, on the very spot in the Campo dei Fiori where Bruno was\nbelieved to have been burned at the stake. For nineteenth-century\nItalian intellectuals such as Vincenzo Gioberti, Bertrando Spaventa\nand Francesco Fiorentino, he was, as he had been for Enlightenment\nthinkers, a \u201cSpinozist\u201d in many respects or more broadly,\na secular humanist, someone who had liberated the human spirit from\nthe suffocating confines of religious orthodoxy and paved the way for\nmodern philosophy and natural science. Catholic apologists rose to the\nChurch\u2019s defence, belittling this \u201cBrunomania\u201d, as\nthey dubbed it, and on occasion denying that Bruno had been executed.\nAmid the turmoil, Bertrando Spaventa, Felice Tocco, Francesco\nFiorentino and other Italian scholars produced critical editions of\nBruno\u2019s Latin and Italian works or wrote studies on them,\nthereby laying the foundations of modern Bruno scholarship and\nappreciation of him as a philosopher. During the twentieth century\nBruno enjoyed a reputation among orthodox historians of the Soviet\nUnion as the first modern genius of a materialist philosophy; those\nwho, like Lev Karsavin, presented a philosophically and historically\ncontextualized interpretation of his thought, were persecuted for\ntheir \u201cbourgeiois\u201d views. Comparatively recent attempts to\nestablish magic or mnemotechnics as the key to his philosophy such as\nthose of Frances Yates, valuable though they remain for incidental\ndetails and insights, obscure Bruno\u2019s stated intention to\narticulate a \u201cnew philosophy\u201d, tout court.\n",
