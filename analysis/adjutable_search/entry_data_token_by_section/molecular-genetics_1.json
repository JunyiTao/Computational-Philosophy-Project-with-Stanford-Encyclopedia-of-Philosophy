    "main_text": "Basic Theory || The basic theory of classical genetics\n2.1  The basic theory of classical genetics\n\n\nThe basic theory associated with classical genetics provided\nexplanations of the transmission of traits from parents to offspring.\nMorgan and his collaborators drew upon a conceptual division between\nthe genetic makeup of an organism, termed its genotype, and\nits observed manifestation called its phenotype (see the\nentry on \n the genotype/phenotype distinction).\nThe relation between the two was treated as causal: genotype in\nconjunction with environment produces phenotype. The theory explained\nthe transmission of phenotypic differences from parents to offspring by\nfollowing the transmission of gene differences from generation to\ngeneration and attributing the presence of alternative traits to the\npresence of alternative forms of genes.\n\n\nI will illustrate the classical mode of explanatory reasoning with a\nsimple historical example involving the fruit fly Drosophila\nmelanogastor. It is worth emphasizing that the mode of reasoning\nillustrated by this historical example is still an important mode of\nreasoning in genetics today, including what is sometimes called\nmolecular genetics.\n\n\nGenes of Drosophila come in pairs, located in corresponding\npositions on the four pairs of chromosomes contained within each cell\nof the fly. The eye-color mutant known as purple is associated\nwith a gene located on chromosome II. Two copies of this gene,\nexisting either in mutated or normal wild-type form, are located at the\nsame locus (corresponding position) in the two\nsecond-chromosomes. Alternative forms of a gene occurring at a\nlocus are called alleles. The transmission of genes from\nparent to offspring is carried out in a special process of cellular\ndivision called meiosis, which produces gamete cells\ncontaining one chromosome from each paired set. The half set of\nchromosomes from an egg and the half set from a sperm combine during\nfertilization, which gives each offspring a copy of one gene from each\ngene pair of its female parent and a copy of one gene from each gene\npair of its male parent. \n\n\nExplanations of the transmission of traits relate the presence of\nalternative genes (genotype) to the presence of alternative observable\ntraits (phenotype). Sometimes this is done in terms of\ndominant/recessive relations. Purple eye-color, for example, is\nrecessive to the wild-type character (red eye-color). This means\nthat flies with two copies of the purple allele (the mutant form of the\ngene, which is designated pr) have purple eyes, but\nheterozygotes, flies with one copy of the purple allele and\none copy of the wild-type allele (designated +), have normal wild-type\neyes (as do flies with two copies of the wild-type allele). See Table\n1.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see how the classical theory explains trait transmission,\nconsider a cross of red-eyed females with purple-eyed males that was\ncarried out by Morgan's collaborators. The offspring\nall had red eyes. So the trait of red eyes was passed from the females\nto all their offspring even though the offspring's\nmale parents had purple eyes. The classical explanation of this\ninheritance pattern proceeds, as do all classical explanations of\ninheritance patterns, in two stages.\n\n\nThe first stage accounts for the transmission of genes and goes as\nfollows (Figure 1): each offspring received one copy of chromosome II\nfrom each parent. The maternally derived chromosomes must have\ncontained the wild-type allele (since both second-chromosomes of every\nfemale parent used in the experiment contained the wild-type allele --\nthis was known on the basis of previous experiments). The paternally\nderived chromosomes must have contained the purple allele (since both\nsecond-chromosomes of every male parent contained the purple allele --\nthis was inferred from the knowledge that purple is recessive to red\neye-color). Hence, all offspring were heterozygous (pr /\n+). Having explained the genetic makeup of the progeny by\ntracing the transmission of genes from parents to offspring, we can\nproceed to the second stage of the explanation: drawing an inference\nabout phenotypic appearances. Since all offspring were heterozygous\n(pr / +), and since purple is recessive to wild-type,\nall offspring had red eye-color (the wild-type character). See Figure\n1.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the reasoning here does not depend on identifying the\nmaterial make-up, mode of action, or general function of the underlying\ngene. It depends only on the ideas that copies of the gene are\ndistributed from generation to generation and that the difference in\nthe gene (i.e., the difference between pr and +),\nwhatever this difference is, causes the phenotypic difference. The idea\nthat the gene is the difference maker needs to be qualified:\ndifferences in the gene cause phenotypic differences in particular\ngenetic and environmental contexts. This idea is so crucial and so\noften overlooked that it merits articulation as a principle (Waters\n1994):\n\n\nDifference principle: differences in a classical gene cause\nuniform phenotypic differences in particular genetic and environmental\ncontexts.\n\n\n\nIt is also worth noting that the difference principle provides a\nmeans to explain the transmission of phenotypic characteristics from\none generation to the next without explaining how these characteristics\nare produced in the process of an organism's\ndevelopment. This effectively enabled classical geneticists to develop\na science of heredity without answering questions about\ndevelopment. \n\n The practice of classical genetics included the theoretical analysis of\ncomplicated transmission patterns involving the recombination of\nphenotypic traits. Analyzing these patterns yielded information about\nthe basic biological processes such as chromosomal mechanics as well as\ninformation about the linear arrangement of genes in linkage groups.\nThese theoretical explanations did not depend on ideas about what genes\nare, how genes are replicated, what genes do, or how differences in\ngenes bring about differences in phenotypic traits. \n",
