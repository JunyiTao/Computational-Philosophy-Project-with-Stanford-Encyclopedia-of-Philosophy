    "main_text": "\n\nDecision theory is concerned with the reasoning underlying an\nagent\u2019s choices, whether this is a mundane choice between taking\nthe bus or getting a taxi, or a more far-reaching choice about whether\nto pursue a demanding political career. (Note that \u201cagent\u201d\nhere stands for an entity, usually an individual person, that is\ncapable of deliberation and action.) Standard thinking is that what an\nagent chooses to do on any given occasion is completely determined by\nher beliefs and desires or values, but this is not uncontroversial, as\nwill be noted below. In any case, decision theory is as much a theory\nof beliefs, desires and other relevant attitudes as it is a theory of\nchoice; what matters is how these various attitudes (call them\n\u201cpreference attitudes\u201d) cohere together.\n\nThe focus of this entry is normative decision theory. That is, the\nmain question of interest is what criteria an agent\u2019s preference\nattitudes should satisfy in any generic\ncircumstances. This amounts to a minimal account of\nrationality, one that sets aside more substantial questions\nabout appropriate desires and reasonable beliefs, given the situation\nat hand. The key issue for a minimal account is the treatment of\nuncertainty. The orthodox normative decision theory, expected\nutility (EU) theory, essentially says that, in situations of\nuncertainty, one should prefer the option with greatest\nexpected desirability or value. (Note that in this context,\n\u201cdesirability\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d should be\nunderstood as desirability/value according to the agent in\nquestion.) This simple maxim will be the focus of much of our\ndiscussion.\n\nThe structure of this entry is as follows: Section 1 discusses the\nbasic notion of \u201cpreferences over prospects\u201d, which lies\nat the heart of decision theory. Section 2 describes the development\nof normative decision theory in terms of ever more powerful and\nflexible measures of preferences. Section 3 discusses the two\nbest-known versions of EU theory. Section 4 considers the broader\nsignificance of EU theory for practical action, inference, and\nvaluing. Section 5 turns to prominent challenges to EU theory, while\nSection 6 addresses sequential decisions, and how this richer setting\nbears on debates about rational preferences.\n",
