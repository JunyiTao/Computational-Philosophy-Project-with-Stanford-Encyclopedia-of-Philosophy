    "main_text": "Three Arguments for the Doctrine of Religious Restraint || The Argument from Divisiveness\n3.2 The Argument from Divisiveness\n\n\nIf the liberal critics are correct, one of the problems with the\nargument from warfare is that there is no realistic prospect of\nreligious warfare breaking out in a stable liberal democracy such as\nthe United States. Still, there may be other evils that are more\nlikely to occur under current conditions, which compliance with the\nDRR might help to prevent. For example, it is plausible to suppose\nthat the enactment of a coercive law that cannot be justified except\non religious grounds would engender much anger and frustration on the\npart of those coerced: \u201cwhen legislation is expressly based on\nreligious arguments, the legislation takes on a religious character,\nto the frustration of those who don't share the relevant faith and who\ntherefore lack access to the normative predicate behind the law\u201d\n(Greene 1993, 1060). This in turn breeds division between\ncitizens\u2014anger and distrust between citizens who have to find\nsome amicable way to make collective decisions about common\nmatters. This counts in favor of the DRR precisely because compliance\nwith the DRR diminishes the likelihood of our suffering from such bad\nconsequences.\n\n\nTo this argument, liberal critics offer a three-part reply.  First,\nsuppose it is true that the implementation of coercive laws that can\nbe justified only on religious grounds often causes frustration and\nanger among both secular and religious citizens. The liberal critics\nmaintain that there is reason to believe that compliance with the DRR\nwould also engender frustration and anger among other religious and\nsecular citizens. To this end, they point to the fact that many\nreligious believers believe that conforming to the DRR would\ncompromise their loyalty to God: if they were prohibited from\nsupporting coercive laws for which they take there to be strong but\nexclusively religious reasons to support, they would naturally take\nthemselves to be prohibited from obeying God. But for many religious\nbelievers this is distressing; they take themselves to have overriding\nmoral and religious obligations to obey God. Similarly, some secular\ncitizens will likely be frustrated by the requirement that the DRR\nplaces on religious citizens. According to these secular citizens, all\ncitizens have the right to make political decisions as their\nconscience dictates. And, on some occasions, these secular citizens\nhold that exercising that right will lead religious citizens to\nviolate the DRR.[9]\n\n\nIf this is correct, for the argument from divisiveness to succeed, it\nwould have to provide reason to believe that the level of frustration\nand anger that would be produced by violating the DRR would be greater\nthan that of conforming to the DRR.  But, the liberal critics claim,\nit is doubtful that we have any such reason: in a very religious\nsociety such as the United States, it might be the case that\nrestrictions on the political practice of religious believers\nengenders at least as much frustration as the alternative.\n\n\n Second, the liberal critics argue,\nthere is reason to believe that conformance to the DRR would only\nmarginally alleviate the frustration that some citizens feel when\nconfronted with religious reasons in public political debate. The\nDRR, after all, does not forbid citizens from supporting coercive laws\non religious grounds, nor does it forbid citizens to articulate\nreligious arguments in public. Furthermore, complying with the\nDRR does not prevent religious citizens from advocating their favored\nlaws in bigoted, inflammatory, or obnoxious manners; it has\nnothing to say about political decorum. So, for example, because\nthe DRR doesn't forbid citizens from helping\nthemselves to inflammatory or demeaning rhetoric in political\nargument, the anger and resentment engendered by such rhetoric does\nnot constitute evidence for (or against) the DRR.\n\n\n Third, the liberal critics contend that\nbecause most of the laws that have a chance of enactment in a society\nas pluralistic as the United States will have both religious and\nsecular grounds, it will almost never be the case that any of the\nactual frustration caused by the public presence of religion supports\nthe DRR. Given that the DRR requires not a complete but only a\nlimited privatization of religious belief, very little of the\nfrustration and anger apparently engendered by the public presence of\nreligion counts in favor of the DRR. To which it is worth adding\nthe following point: advocates of the standard view could, with Rorty\n(1995), adopt a more demanding conception of the DRR that requires the\ncomplete privatization of religious belief. But, as many\nadvocates of the standard view itself maintain, it is doubtful that\nthis move improves the argument's prospects. The complete\nprivatization of religion is much more objectionable to religious\ncitizens and, thus, more likely to create social foment. (Rorty,\nit should be noted, softened his approach on this issue. See Rorty\n2003).\n\n\n There are no doubt other factors that need\nto be taken into consideration in the calculation required to formulate\nthe argument from divisiveness. But, the liberal critics\nmaintain, it is unclear how those disparate factors would add up.\nIn particular, if the liberal critics are correct, it is not clear\nwhether requiring citizens to obey the DRR would result in less overall\nfrustration, anger, and division than would not requiring them to do\nso. The issues at stake are empirical in character and the\nrelevant empirical facts are not known.\n",
