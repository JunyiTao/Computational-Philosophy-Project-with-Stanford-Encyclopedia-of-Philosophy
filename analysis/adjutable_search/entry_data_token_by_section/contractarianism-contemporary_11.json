Depending\non the initial justificatory problem, it will yield an outcome\nR (principles, rules, etc. that have some normative property\nL\u2014such as justice, morality, authority, obligation,\nlegitimacy, mutual benefit, and so on. But, supposing that the\ncontract has generated a principle, rule, etc. with the relevant\nnormative property, precisely what is shown by the fact that this\nprinciple or rule was generated through the contractual device?\n\nThroughout we have been distinguishing the justificatory problem from\nthe deliberative model. Now the strongest that could be claimed for a\ncontractual argument is that the outcome of the deliberative model is\nconstitutive of both the correct solution of the\njustificatory problem and the conclusion that \u201cR has\nL.\u201d On this \u201cconstructivist\u201d reading of the\noutcome of the deliberative model, there is no independent and\ndeterminate external justification that R has L,\nwhich the contractual device is intended to approximate, but, rather,\nthat R is the outcome of the deliberative model is the\ntruth-maker for \u201cR has L\u201d.\n\nRawls, along with Gauthier and Buchanan, was sometimes attracted to\nsuch a reading. Rawls (1999, 104) describes the argument from the\noriginal position as invoking \u201cpure procedural\njustice\u201d\u2014the deliberative situation is so set up that\nwhatever principles it generates are, by the fact of their\ngeneration, just. But, his considered position is that the outcome of\nthe deliberative model is indicative (not constitutive) of\nthe correct solution to \u201cthe question of justification\u201d\n(1999, 16).\n\nWe might say that the deliberative model is evidence of the\nproper answer to the question of justification. However, this is still\nconsistent with Rawls\u2019s \u201cconstructivism\u201d because the\nanswer to the justificatory problem is constitutive of\nR\u2019s having L. So we might say that\nRawls\u2019s two principles are just\u2014simply because they are in\nreflective equilibrium with the considered judgments of you and me and\nthat they would be chosen in the original position is indicative of\nthis.\n\nThe weakest interpretation of the contract is that the contractual\nresult is simply indicative of the correct answer to the\njustificatory problem, which itself is simply indicative of the fact\nthat R has L. One could be a \u201crealist,\u201d\nmaintaining that whether R has L is a fact that\nholds whether or not the contract device generates R has\nL, and independently of whether the correct answer to our\njustificatory problem (i.e., what we can justify to each other) is\nthat R has L. There is still logical space for a\ntype of contractualism here, but an indicative contractualism of this\nsort would not be a form of \u201cconstructivism.\u201d Some, for\nexample, have argued that Scanlon\u2019s theory is actually based on\na sort of natural rights theory, where these rights are prior to the\ncontract (Mack 2007). Even if this is correct, Scanlon can be a sort\nof social contract theorist. The diversity of possible approaches\nwithin social contract theory indicates the variety of different uses\nto which social contract theory can be applied.\n6. Conclusion: The Social Contract and Justification\n\nThe social contract theories of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau all\nstressed that the justification of the state depends on showing that\neveryone would, in some way, consent to it. By relying on consent,\nsocial contract theory seemed to suppose a voluntarist conception of\npolitical justice and obligation: what counts as \u201cjustice\u201d\nof \u201cobligation\u201d depends on what people agree\nto\u2014whatever that might be. Only in Kant (1797) does it become\nclear that consent is not fundamental to a social contract view: we\nhave a duty to agree to act according to the idea of the\n\u201coriginal contract.\u201d Rawls\u2019s revival of social\ncontract theory in A Theory of Justice did not base\nobligations on consent, though the apparatus of an \u201coriginal\nagreement\u201d persisted as a way to help solve the problem of\njustification. As the question of public justification takes center\nstage, it becomes clear that posing the problem of justification in\nterms of a deliberative or a bargaining problem is a heuristic: the\nreal issue is \u201cthe problem of justification\u201d\u2014what\nprinciples can be justified to all reasonable citizens or persons.",
