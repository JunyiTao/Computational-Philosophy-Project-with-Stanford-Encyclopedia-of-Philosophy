    "main_text": "Anglo-American philosophy of history || General laws in history?\n3.1 General laws in history?\n\nThe philosopher of science Carl Hempel stimulated analytic\nphilosophers\u2019 interest in historical knowledge in his essay,\n\u201cThe Function of General Laws in History\u201d (1942).\nHempel\u2019s general theory of scientific explanation held that all\nscientific explanations require subsumption under general laws. Hempel\nconsidered historical explanation as an apparent exception to the\ncovering-law model and attempted to show the suitability of the\ncovering-law model even to this special case. He argued that valid\nhistorical explanations too must invoke general laws. The covering-law\napproach to historical explanation was supported by other analytical\nphilosophers of science, including Ernest Nagel (1961). Hempel\u2019s\nessay provoked a prolonged controversy between supporters who cited\ngeneralizations about human behavior as the relevant general laws, and\ncritics who argued that historical explanations are more akin to\nexplanations of individual behavior, based on interpretation that\nmakes the outcome comprehensible. Especially important discussions\nwere offered by William Dray (1957), Michael Scriven (1962), and Alan\nDonagan (1966). Donagan and others pointed out the difficulty that\nmany social explanations depend on probabilistic regularities rather\nthan universal laws. Others, including Scriven, pointed out the\npragmatic features of explanation, suggesting that arguments that fall\nfar short of deductive validity are nonetheless sufficient to\n\u201cexplain\u201d a given historical event in a given context of\nbelief. The most fundamental objections, however, are these: first,\nthat there are virtually no good examples of universal laws in\nhistory, whether of human behavior or of historical event succession\n(Donagan 1966: 143\u201345); and second, that there are other\ncompelling schemata through which we can understand historical actions\nand outcomes that do not involve subsumption under general laws\n(Elster 1989). These include the processes of reasoning through which\nwe understand individual actions\u2014analogous to the methods of\nverstehen and the interpretation of rational behavior\nmentioned above (Dray 1966: 131\u201337); and the processes through\nwhich we can trace out chains of causation and specific causal\nmechanisms without invoking universal laws.\n\nA careful re-reading of these debates over the covering-law model in\nhistory suggests that the debate took place largely because of the\nerroneous assumption of the unity of science and the postulation of\nthe regulative logical similarity of all areas of scientific reasoning\nto a few clear examples of explanation in a few natural sciences. This\napproach was a deeply impoverished one, and handicapped from the start\nin its ability to pose genuinely important questions about the nature\nof history and historical knowledge. Explanation of human actions and\noutcomes should not be understood along the lines of an explanation of\nwhy radiators burst when the temperature falls below zero degrees\ncentigrade. As Donagan concludes, \u201cIt is harmful to overlook the\nfundamental identity of the social sciences with history, and to\nmutilate research into human affairs by remodeling the social sciences\ninto deformed likenesses of physics\u201d (1966: 157). The insistence\non naturalistic models for social and historical research leads easily\nto a presumption in favor of the covering-law model of explanation,\nbut this presumption is misleading.\n",
