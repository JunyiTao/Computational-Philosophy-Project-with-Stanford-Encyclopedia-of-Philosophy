    "main_text": "\n\nThe impressive variation amongst biological individuals generates many\ncomplexities in addressing the simple-sounding question what is a\nbiological individual? A distinction between evolutionary and\nphysiological individuals is useful in thinking about biological\nindividuals, as is attention to the kinds of groups, such as\nsuperorganisms and species, that have sometimes been thought of as\nbiological individuals. More fully understanding the conceptual space\nthat biological individuals occupy also involves considering a range\nof other concepts, such as life, reproduction, and agency. There has\nbeen a focus in some recent discussions by both philosophers and\nbiologists on how evolutionary individuals are created and regulated,\nas well as continuing work on the evolution of individuality.\n",
