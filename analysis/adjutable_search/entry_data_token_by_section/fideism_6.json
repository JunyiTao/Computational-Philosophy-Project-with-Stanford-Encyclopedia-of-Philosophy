    "main_text": "A Rational Fideism?\n5. Reason without Limits?\n\nAs we saw above, Evans and Bishop seek to rehabilitate fideism by\nidentifying spaces inaccessible to (some form of) reason: faith is\nwarrantable where reason reaches its limit. But suppose there is no\nsuch limit. This is the counter-fideistic suggestion made by the\ncontemporary French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux, who seeks to\nundercut religious theism by denying it a conceptual sphere of its\nown. If there is no distinction to be made between faith and reason\nthat would constitute a limit to the latter, then philosophy need not\nyield to religious claims to extra-rational revelation.\n\nAccording to Meillassoux, the attractions of fideism can be traced to\nwhat he takes to be a basic dogma of philosophical thought since Kant,\nwhich he calls correlationism. According to correlationism,\nthinking and being go hand in hand, such that there can be no\nconception of the world independent of human experience: things in\nthemselves are thus unknowable (and on a strong reading unthinkable).\nCorrelationists embrace finitude as part of the human condition; it is\nwithin this finitude that post-metaphysical thought, including\nphenomenology and analytic philosophy, operates. So understood,\nphilosophy seeks to describe what is given in experience, but\nit can furnish these facts with no ultimate ground or necessity.\nAccording to post-metaphysical philosophy, the principle of sufficient\nreason \u2013 whatever its utility in the phenomenal world \u2013 is\nthus circumscribed within a more fundamental abyss of contingency.\n\nMeillassoux argues that this drawing of a boundary to reason within\npost-metaphysical philosophy is what authorizes fideistic\nreligion:\n\n\nAccordingly, facticity entails a specific and rather remarkable\nconsequence: it becomes rationally illegitimate to disqualify\nirrational discourses about the absolute on the pretext of their\nirrationality. From the perspective of the strong model, in effect,\nreligious belief has every right to maintain that the world was\ncreated out of nothingness from an act of love, or that God\u2019s\nomnipotence allows him to dissolve the apparent contradition between\nhis complete identity and His difference with his Son. These\ndiscourses continue to be meaningful \u2013 in a mythological or\nmystical register \u2013 even though they are scientifically and\nlogically meaningless (41).\n\nFar from abolishing the value of the absolute, the process that\ncontinues to be referred to today as \u201cthe end of\nabsolutes\u201d grants the latter an unprecedented\nlicence \u2013 philosophers seem to ask only one thing of these\nabsolutes: that they be devoid of the slightest pretensions to\nrationality. The end of metaphysics, understood as the\n\u201cde-absolutization of thought,\u201d is thereby seen to consist\nin the rational legitimation of any and every variety of religious (or\n\u201cpoetico-religious\u201d) belief in the absolute, so long as\nthe latter invokes no authority beside itself. To put it in other\nwords: by forbidding reason any claim to the absolute, the end of\nmetaphysics has taken the form of an exacerbated return of the\nreligious (45).\n\n\nMeillassoux concludes that, insofar as it cedes the absolute \u2013 the\ndomain once claimed by metaphysics \u2013 to religion, strong\ncorrelationsim is \u201cmerely the other name\u201d for\nfideism (48).\n\nFor his part, Meillassoux advocates not a return to pre-critical\nmetaphysics, but a critique of Critique, which would re-open\nphilosophical access to what he calls the \u201cgreat\noutdoors\u201d \u2013 i.e., Kant\u2019s \u201cthing in itself\u201d\nor, to put it in Meillassoux\u2019s terms, the \u201cthing without\nme.\u201d While conceding that sensory concepts imply a human\nrelation to the world, Meillassoux argues that mathematics offers\nprivileged access to \u201cprimary qualities,\u201d thus breaking\nphilosophy out of correlationism. Rather than simply describing what\nis given in experience, speculative philosophy can venture alongside\nthe physical sciences into an account of the world before human beings\nexisted, which Meillassoux calls \u201cancestrality.\u201d\n\nThe ensuing account is one in which Meillassoux rejects any idea of\nnecessary being, whether religious or metaphysical. Where\ncorrelationism attributes the apparent absence of any sufficient\n(metaphysical) reason for the existence of things to an\nepistemological limit, Meillassoux argues that it points to something\nontological:\n\nWe must convert facticity into the real property whereby everything\nand every world is without reason, and is thereby capable\nof actually becoming otherwise without reason. We must grasp how\nthe ultimate absence of reason, which we will refer to as\n\u201cunreason,\u201d is an absolute ontological property, and not\nthe mark of the finitude of our knowledge (53).\n\n\nThe only absolute, on this understanding, is the principle of\nunreason \u2013 i.e., the necessity of contingency.\n\nInstead of retiring the concept of God, however, Meillassoux wants to\nclaim it for philosophy: what takes the place of revealed religion, on\nthis account, is not straightforwardly atheism, but the God of the\nphilosophers. God\u2019s inexistence belongs, Meillassoux argues, to\nthe general contingency he takes to be the condition of all being. Put\nthe other way around, this means that it is necessarily the case that\nGod\u2019s existence is possible (Watkin, 149). On Christopher\nWatkin\u2019s reading, \u201cMeillassoux comes tantalisingly close\nhere to implying that the only way to be rid of God is rationally to\nprove his existence, but we shall have to wait a little while longer\nfor his conclusion on the existence of God\u201d (137).\n\nMeillassoux\u2019s critique is not of religion per se, but of what he\nperceives as an unwillingness on the part of modern philosophy to\nstress the claim of reason. On his reading, correlationism opens space\nthat doctrines lacking rational support quickly fill. However, to call\nthese doctrines \u201cfideism\u201d would be misleading: as\ndescribed earlier, the term refers to a philosophical position\nabout reason, as opposed to the beliefs that a proponent of\nthis position might view as not requiring \u201crational\u201d\nsupport. Perhaps his point is simply that strong correlationism might\nbe taken to establish a division of labor congenial to believing\nwithout reason, and that insofar as it purports to place limits on\nreason, it constitutes a form of fideistic philosophy.\n\nGiven its contrarian approach to nearly the whole of modern\nphilosophy, Meillassoux\u2019s thought is at least as controversial\nas the \u201cfideism\u201d it challenges, and its plausibility\ndepends on one\u2019s position on a host of fundamental issues which\nit is beyond the scope of this article to discuss. (For useful\ncritical discussions of Meillassoux\u2019s thought, see Sparrow and\nWatkin.) In this respect, it helps to show how the question of\nfideism, far from being a peripheral issue in the philosophy of\nreligion, leads directly into the very deepest questions of modern\nmetaphysics and epistemology.\n",
