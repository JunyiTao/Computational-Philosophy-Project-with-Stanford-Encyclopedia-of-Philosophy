    "main_text": "Penbygull on Universals and Predication\n4. Penbygull's Theory of Identity\n\nThis interpretative scheme of the nature and kinds of predication is\nultimately grounded on a notion of identity, necessarily different\nfrom the standard one. According to the most common opinion the\nlogical criteria for identity and (real) distinction were the\nfollowing: \n\na is identical with b if and only if for all\nx, x is predicated of a iff it is\npredicated of b;\n\n\na differs from (is [really] distinct from) b iff\nthere is at least one z such that a is predicated of\nz and b is not, or vice versa, or there is\nat least one w such that w is predicated of\na and not of b, or vice versa.\n\n\nOn this basis one can easily conclude that universals and individuals\ncan never be the same, at least because of the forms of generality\n(which cannot be predicated of individuals) and of thisness (which\ncannot be predicated of universals). So Penbygull had to put forward\nnew criteria for identity and distinction. First of all, he\ndistinguishes between the notion of non-identity and that of\ndifference (or distinction) and denies that the notion of difference\nimplies that of non-identity (De universalibus, p. 190); then\nhe affirms that the two notions of difference and (real) identity are\nlogically compatible (ibid.); finally he suggests the\nfollowing definitions for these three notions non-identity, difference\nor distinction, and (absolute) identity (De universalibus,\npp. 190\u201391):\n\na is non-identical with b iff there is no form\nF such that F is present in the same way in\na and b;\n\n\na differs from b iff there is at least one form\nF such that F is directly present in\na but not in b or vice versa;\n\na is (absolutely) identical with b if and only if\nfor any form F, F is present in a iff it is\npresent in the same way in b.\n\n\nThe criterion for non-identity is stronger than the common one for\nreal distinction: two things can be qualified as non-identical iff\nthey belong to distinct categories. On the other side, the definition\nof difference does not exclude the possibility that two things which\ndiffer from each other share one or more properties (or forms). Thus,\nthere are degrees of distinction, and what is more, the degree of\ndistinction between two things can be read as the inverse measure of\ntheir (partial) identity. For instance, if we compare the list of the\nforms (both substantial and accidental) which constitute Socrates and\nthose which make up the universal-man, it is evident that Socrates and\nthe universal-man differ from each other, since there are forms which\ndirectly inhere in Socrates and not in the universal-man and vice\nversa; but it is also evident that the two lists are identical\nfor a long section, that is, that Socrates and the universal-man,\nconsidered from the point of view of their metaphysical composition,\nare partially the same. As a result, the copula of the propositions\nwhich Penbygull deals with cannot be extensionally interpreted, as it\ndoes not mean that a given object is a member of a certain set, nor\nthat a given set is included in another, but it always means degrees\nin identity between two compound entities.\n",
