Collective Responsibility and the Question of Consequences\n\nWhen is it appropriate to hold a group responsible for harm? When is\nit appropriate to refrain from holding a group responsible? As things\nnow stand, we generally assume that to hold a group\u2014or, for that\nmatter, an individual\u2014responsible for harm is simply to\nestablish that he, she, or it is responsible for the harm, and as such\nwe do not generally find the above question especially challenging.\nIndeed, we often assume that we can answer it by simply reiterating\nthe conditions of collective responsibility itself.\n\nBut to hold an agent responsible for harm is not simply to establish\nthat he, she, or it is responsible for the harm. Instead, it is to\nmake the agents\u2019 responsibility known both to them and to the\nrest of the community or, in other words, to publicize their\nresponsibility as part of a social or legal practice of accountability\nin particular contexts with particular purposes in mind.\n\nThe differences between these two things\u2014the act of\nholding an agent responsible for harm and the agent\u2019s\nbeing responsible for it\u2014are worth underscoring. While\nX\u2019s being responsible for harm is a matter of\nwhat X has done, our holding of X\nresponsible is a matter of what we do with our knowledge of\nX\u2019s behavior. The former is ostensibly a moral fact\nabout X. The latter is an act that we ourselves perform as\npart of a social or legal practice of accountability.\n\nWhen are we justified in performing such an act of accountability?\nSince holding agents responsible for harm sheds a negative light on\nthem and frequently results in calls for compensation and/or\npunishment, we generally insist on taking fairness seriously\nin this context and, in our efforts to take fairness seriously, we\ngenerally require accuracy with respect to the facts of\nresponsibility. Indeed, we often combine these two conditions and say\nthat it would not be fair to hold an agent responsible for harm if he,\nshe, or it was not really responsible for it.\n\nBut fairness is not always just a matter of factual accuracy when it\ncomes to holding groups responsible. Instead, it can be\u2014and\noften is\u2014a matter of making sure that we do not in our holding\nof agents responsible discriminate between equally responsible agents.\nIn other words, it can be\u2014and often is\u2014a matter of\ntreating like cases in the same fashion so as not to be\ndiscriminatory. Hence the emphasis that we now see being placed by\npost-war tribunals on making sure that if collective responsibility is\nascribed to particular groups it is ascribed to all groups according\nto general rules.\n\nAs it turns out, we do not always treat like cases in a similar\nfashion. Nor, for that matter, do we always place fairness above all\nelse. Indeed, we sometimes choose to discriminate between cases that\nappear to be the same. Moreover, we do so in some cases on\nself-consciously consequentialist grounds that we find to be\njustified.\n\nIn many of these cases, we are concerned with whether or not we can\nbring about positive consequences in the world by holding particular\ngroups responsible. (Would these groups behave better if we did? Would\nothers follow suit? Would harm be prevented?) In other cases, we are\nconcerned with consequences of a decidedly more negative sort. (Would\nholding particular groups responsible for harm lead to greater\nanimosity among groups? create resentment in the community? stand in\nthe way of peace?)\n\nInterestingly enough, those who are concerned about responsibility in\nphilosophical circles are frequently hesitant to enter into a full\nblown consequentialist debate about when we should hold particular\nagents responsible in practice. (We suggest why this may be so below.)\nBut they do often make clear that they have particular consequences in\nmind when, in an off-handed fashion, they assess collective\nresponsibility in practice. In the case of individual responsibility,\nthese consequences tend to be positive and include the reinforcement\nof norms associated with moral agency. In the case of collective\nresponsibility, they tend to be both positive and negative.\n\nWhile defenders of collective responsibility do not always distinguish\nbetween the consequences of holding particular groups responsible in\npractice and the value of collective responsibility per se,\nthey do make clear that we can do important things in the world by\nholding particular groups responsible for harm. Among other things, we\ncan raise consciousness among groups about what they are doing. We can\nget them to stop harming others. We can reinforce social norms that\nprevent such harm from occurring in the future. And we can make clear\nto the world that those being harmed are worth taking seriously.\n\nList and Pettit (2011), as we saw in Section 2, make clear that\nholding groups responsible for particular kinds of harm not only\n\u201clets us discern the true contours of the moral and political\nworld we inhabit\u201d (List and Pettit 2011, p. 185), but provides\nincentives for change among group members (p. 168), and conditions\nthem to behave better in the future (p. 157). Likewise, it can provide\nthe basis for institutional reform in cases where collective acts were\nhitherto invisible.\n\nWhat about the negative consequences that might follow from holding\nparticular groups responsible for harm? Not surprisingly, the most\ncommonly cited of these consequences are those associated with the\nfreeing of individuals from personal responsibility in both private\nand public life. In some cases, the negative consequences thought to\nfollow from collective responsibility are a matter of moral degeneracy\nand/or the avoidance of just punishment. In other cases, they are a\nmatter of the erosion of liberal ideals and/or threats to democratic\ngovernance.\n\nNot surprisingly, these arguments have been taken in a variety of\ndirections over the years. Garrett Hardin\u2019s early work focused\non the squashing of individual initiatives associated with collective\nresponsibility (Hardin 1968). So, too, did the works of many others\nduring the Cold War. Contemporary liberals tend to be less vehement\nthan Hardin with respect to the ways in which collective\nresponsibility undermines individual moral agency. But they, too,\nworry that individuals will not take responsibility for harm that\ntheir group is being held responsible for as well. Moreover, there is\nsome historical evidence for their concerns.\n\nRichard McKeon, in an essay that rarely finds its way into\ncontemporary work on collective responsibility, provides us with\nimportant insights into the ways in which the replacement of\ncollective responsibility with personal responsibility in the West was\npolitically, as well as morally, crucial to the development of\nliberalism. According to McKeon, the replacement of collective\nresponsibility with personal responsibility meant not only that\nindividuals could exercise moral agency as individuals but that the\nstate would no longer be as necessary as it once was, since\nindividuals could now take responsibility for governing themselves\n(McKeon 1957).\n\nBut, of course, we cannot, on an a priori basis, treat personal and\ncollective responsibility as mutually exclusive. For, there is always\nthe possibility of bringing them together and doing so in ways that\nenhance both. Robert Goodin (Goodin 1998) suggests what such an\nintegrated system of responsibility might look like in the context of\na welfare state. List and Pettit underscore how individual and\ncollective responsibility might co-exist on a more general level.\n(List and Pettit 2011, pp. 121\u2013122)\n\nOne of the most interesting critiques of the practice of collective\nresponsibility put forward by a contemporary philosopher is that of\nMark Reiff (2008). Reiff concedes that holding particular groups\nresponsible for harm can do good things in the world, e.g., deter\nthese groups from performing harmful actions in the future, aid us in\nbringing about social order more generally, and provide communities\nwith a basis for justice. But he makes clear that holding groups\nresponsible for harm can also lead to both the escalation of violence\nand the watering down of moral strictures. Indeed, he claims,\n\u201csome of the most heinous crimes in human\nhistory\u2014including the Nazi\u2019s Final Solution and genocide\nin Rwanda\u2014have been facilitated if not motivated by a belief in\ncollective responsibility\u201d (Reiff 2008, p. 234).\n\nReiff\u2019s primary focus when discussing collective responsibility\nand violence is on what can go wrong when we hold groups responsible\nfor harm over time in contexts where each side in a conflict defines\nthe other as collectively responsible for historical wrongs. According\nto Reiff, in such cases, we are bound to encounter endless cycles of\nretaliation, as well as the presentation of murderous acts as acts of\npunishment. Moreover, we are bound to encounter these kinds of things\nnot because the actors in question lack a sense of morality but\nbecause of the particular kind of moral righteousness that claims of\ncollective responsibility allow those who want to retaliate against\ntheir enemies in the name of a higher morality.\n\nSince Reiff\u2019s focus here is on moral righteousness, we might\nexpect him to view the practice of holding groups responsible as\nbolstering morality (albeit morality of a peculiar and skewed kind).\nBut he does not do so. Instead, he argues just the opposite, namely,\nthat claims of collective responsibility can\u2014and often\ndo\u2014undermine both the importance of morality in general and the\neffectiveness of punishment in particular. Here his focus is primarily\non what happens when we internalize claims of collective\nresponsibility.\n\nReiff argues that when we internalize claims of collective\nresponsibility, we may come to feel more responsibility\u2014or\nresponsibility for more things\u2014than we used to feel. But we are\nless likely to follow the dictates of morality. For, while the range\nof our responsibility has been expanded, the ties between\nresponsibility and morality have been weakened. Indeed, these ties may\nin some cases be totally severed. How might this happen?\n\nReiff does not claim, as those before him did, that the practice of\ncollective responsibility allows individuals to avoid personal\nresponsibility and hence reduces both their moral agency and their\nculpability for harm. Nor does he, as his predecessors did, understand\nthe problem in question as a matter of too little personal\nresponsibility in general. Instead, he understands the problem as a\nmatter of individuals feeling responsible for harm even when they have\ndone nothing wrong. (Presumably, the moral dictates that Reiff is\nconcerned with here are those associated with an individual\u2019s\nown actions.) According to Reiff,\n\n[the] problem is not that people are less likely to feel\nresponsibility for their own misconduct if they feel that others will\nbe held collectively responsible for harm. \u2026 The problem is\nthat collective responsibility encourages people to feel responsible\nand subject to punishment even when they have behaved correctly.\nHence, punishment is no longer an incentive. (Reiff 2008, p. 241)\n\n\nIn the end, he concludes, \u201c[e]mbracing collective responsibility\nundermines the very concept of responsibility itself, for it\nencourages people to disregard rather than obey the structures of\nmorality\u201d (Reiff 2008, p. 242).\n\nInterestingly enough, most of those who offer consequentialist\ncritiques of collective responsibility\u2014and again they are almost\nalways concerned with the practice of holding groups responsible for\nharm rather than with the facts of responsibility per\nse\u2014do so on a surprisingly general level. In other words,\nthey do not provide us with a set of criteria for thinking about the\nvalue of holding groups morally responsible in particular situations.\nBut they could do so very productively on the basis of the more\ngeneral arguments that Reiff and others provide. Moreover, they could\ndo so without violating their own agent-based approaches to moral\nresponsibility. For, as we have suggested above, being morally\nresponsible and holding others morally responsible are not the same\nthing. Nor do they have the same relationship to consequences. While\nconsequences may be irrelevant to moral responsibility itself, they\nmay be absolutely key to our choice to hold\u2014or not to\nhold\u2014agents morally responsible in practice.\n",
