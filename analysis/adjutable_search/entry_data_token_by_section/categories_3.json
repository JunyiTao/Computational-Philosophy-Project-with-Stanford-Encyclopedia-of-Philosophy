    "main_text": "Category Systems || Skepticism about Category Systems\n1.5 Skepticism about Category Systems\n\nBoth realist and descriptivist category systems, at least as\ntraditionally presented, seem to presuppose that there is a unique\ntrue answer to the question of what categories of entity there are\n\u2013 indeed the discovery of this answer is the goal of most such\ninquiries into ontological categories. Grossman, for example, argues\nthat a list of categories must be complete, contain everything, with\neverything in its proper place (1983, 4). Johansson similarly\ntakes his project as to \u201cdevelop a coherent system of\nall the most abstract categories needed to give a true\ndescription of the world\u201d (1989, 1). Arguments about which of\nthe many systems of categories offered is correct likewise seem to\npresuppose that there is a uniquely correct list of categories.\n\nBut actual category systems offered vary so much that even a short\nsurvey of past category systems like that above can undermine the\nbelief that such a unique, true and complete system of categories may\nbe found. Given such a diversity of answers to the question of what\nthe ontological categories are, by what criteria could we possibly\nchoose among them to determine which is uniquely correct?\n\nSome minimal standards of adequacy immediately suggest themselves\n(Butchvarov 1995, 75). Whether one takes a realist or descriptivist\napproach to providing a system of categories, if that system is\nsupposed to be comprehensive, it clearly must meet at least the\nstandard of being exhaustive \u2013 providing a category for\neverything there is (on the realist approach) or might be (on the\ndescriptive approach). Nonetheless, one may, as Hoffman and\nRosenkrantz (1994, 140) do, present a system of some\nfundamental categories without taking it to be exhaustive.\n\nAnother minimal criterion of adequacy is generally taken to be that\nthe highest categories (or, for tree systems, the categories at each\nlevel of branching) be mutually exclusive, ensuring that whatever\nthere is (or might be) finds its place in exactly one highest\ncategory, or one category at each level (Chisholm 1989, 162). (This\nstill allows for nested categories, so that something may belong to\nboth a more specific category like substance and a more general\ncategory like individual.)\n\nBut these criteria are not enough to provide the needed reassurance.\nFirst, we lack assurance that most proposed category systems meet even\nthese minimal conditions. As mentioned above, Aristotle drew out his\ncategories largely by considering the types of question that could be\nasked (and the types of answer appropriate to them). It is difficult\nto know, however, how one can be assured that all kinds of questions\nhave been surveyed, and so difficult to know that an exhaustive list\nof categories has been offered \u2013 a point Aristotle does not\nattempt to demonstrate (Ackrill 1963, 80\u201381). Indeed, the fact\nthat Aristotle provides different lists of categories in different\nplaces suggests that he did not consider his list final and\nexhaustive. Similarly, Kant\u2019s system of categories can be\nthought to be exhaustive only as long as the list of forms of judgment\nfrom which he derives them exhausts the possible forms of judgment\n\u2013 but we have reason to think this is not so (K\u00f6rner 1955,\n50). Johansson, as we have seen, instead uses the method of successive\nabstraction. But it is not clear how following such a method could\nensure either that the categories thereby distinguished are exhaustive\n(how do we know we have considered something of each highest kind if\nwe do not yet know what the highest kinds are?) or even mutually\nexclusive.\n\nSecondly, even if we can verify that the standards of mutual\nexclusivity and exhaustiveness are met, these conditions alone are far\ntoo weak to uniquely pick out a system of categories. Provided one\naccepts the law of the excluded middle, an endless supply of mutually\nexclusive and exhaustive classifications can be generated at will: we\ncan divide things into the spatio-temporally located and the\nnot-spatio-temporally-located, the intentional and the\nnon-intentional, the extended and the non-extended, to name but a few\nof the more relevant ways in which things could be divided. Indeed one\nof the sources of puzzlement about categories comes from the fact that\nphilosophers have selected so many different sorts of divide as\nthe fundamental category difference \u2013 for Descartes,\nthe extended and the thinking (unextended), for Chisholm the\ncontingent and the necessary, for Hoffman and Rosenkrantz the concrete\nand the abstract, and so on. Thus another reason for skepticism about\nthe existence of a unique set of categories comes from the\nfact that categories are supposed to be the most abstract genera under\nwhich things (may) fall. But from any given entity, abstraction may\napparently be done in a variety of ways \u2013 even if we are careful\nto do so in ways that ensure mutual exclusivity and\nexhaustiveness.\n\nDoubts about possibilities for discovering the one true category\nsystem have led many to eschew talk of category systems altogether,\nand others to adopt some kind of relativism about category systems\nthat ceases to take systems of categories seriously as candidate lists\nof the single set of highest genera under which anything\nfalls (or could fall). Jan Westerhoff (2005), for example, argues that\nthere is no unique, absolute set of ontological categories. On his\nview categories in metaphysics turn out to be analogous to axioms in\nmathematical theories; in each case, there may be more than one way to\nsystematize our knowledge from a relatively simple basis. The result\nis a kind of relativity about systems of categories: \u201cwhich set\nof ontological categories we choose is primarily a matter of\nconvenience, in the same way as specific axiomatizations of\npropositional logic or Newtonian mechanics are more convenient to use\nthan others\u201d (2005, 218). As a result, Westerhoff argues, we\nmust reassess the importance of ontological categories in metaphysics\n\u2013 these should not be considered \u201cthe most fundamental\nparts of the world, but... the most fundamental parts of our\nsystematization of the world\u201d (2005, 135).\n\nOthers have taken the variety of category systems explicitly offered\nor presupposed by philosophers as mere evidence of the particular\npresuppositions of their thought, or prejudices of their age \u2013\nnot as evidence about anything to do with the world and its divisions.\nThus, e.g., Stephan K\u00f6rner\u2019s discussion of categorial\nframeworks is designed to make explicit how a thinker\u2019s\nframework categorizes objects, making use of certain individuative\nprinciples, and making clear his reasons for holding that framework\n(1970, 10). R. G. Collingwood, in similar vein, treats the task of\nmetaphysics generally as merely uncovering the \u201cpresuppositions\nunderlying ordinary science\u201d (1940 [1998]).\n\nThe specific worries about (1) guaranteeing the mutual exclusiveness\nand joint exhaustiveness of the categories, and (2) whether or not any\nsingle system of categories could purport to be uniquely correct, can,\nhowever, be met by certain ways of formulating ontological categories.\nThe first sort of worry can be met by ensuring that categories (of the\nsame level) are defined in ways that guarantee mutual exclusiveness\nand exhaustiveness. Thus, e.g., Thomasson (1999, chapter 8)\ndistinguishes categories in terms of what relations of dependence a\npurported entity has or lacks on mental states (and a second\ndimension is distinguished in terms of what relations of dependence a\npurported entity has or lacks on spatio-temporally located objects),\nso that the law of the excluded middle alone ensures mutual\nexclusiveness and exhaustiveness of the categories distinguished.\n(Dummett\u2019s method of distinguishing categories provides another\nroute for guaranteeing mutual exclusivity \u2013 see \u00a72.3\nbelow).\n\nMulti-dimensional systems (Husserl 1913 [1962], \u00a710; Ingarden\n1960 [1964], Chapter 2; Thomasson 1999, Chapter 8; Smith 2007, Chapter\n8) address the second worry to some extent by acknowledging that the\ndifferent dimensions of categorization are possible, and that no\none-dimensional list can purport to completeness. In principle,\nmulti-dimensionalists may even accept that there is no fixed number or\nlimit on how many one-dimensional lists of categories there may be,\nthough each such list may purport to provide a unique, correct,\nexhaustive categorization of entities considered in the chosen\nrespect.\n\nIn any case, given the great potential uses of a system of categories\n(many of which do not depend on claims that that category system is\nuniquely \u2018correct\u2019), we should not prematurely abandon\nattempts at developing and evaluating systems of categorization. Even\nif we do not think of a category system as providing a realist\ninventory of all that exists or a description of the fundamental\nintrinsic \u2018divisions of reality\u2019, a system of categories\nlaid out in the descriptivist spirit provides a framework within which\nexistence questions can be answered in a systematic and wholesale way,\nby enumerating categories so that we can then undertake further\ninvestigations into whether or not there really is anything of each\nkind. Working from within a categorial framework can help ensure that\nwhatever ontology we provide is principled and unified, avoiding\nad hoc and piecemeal decisions. The descriptivist\u2019s\ncategories also provide a tool that may be used elsewhere in ontology,\ne.g., in helping to ensure that comparisons of parsimony are\nlegitimately made (by examining which categories of entity are\naccepted and which denied by various theories), and in checking that\npotential solutions to metaphysical problems are not overlooked by\ntacit use of a category system that is not exhaustive (Thomasson 1999,\nChapters 8 and 9). Another important use of systems of categories is\nthat, with a proposed set of categories laid out, we can, as Daniel\nNolan (2011) suggests, go on to investigate questions about the\nrelationships among entities that are placed in different categories:\nfor example, questions about whether events depend on or are grounded\nin things, or (as Nolan suggests) whether things and events may\nultimately be identified as belonging to a single category.\nAssumptions about categorizations play such a strong role in\nphilosophical discussions (e.g., discussions of the Cartesian theory\nof mind, Platonist theories of mathematics, etc.), that doing the work\non categories necessary to make these categorial assumptions explicit\nand open them for examination must remain a highly useful exercise\nregardless of doubts about the prospects for discovering a uniquely\ncorrect system of categories.\n",
