But as Hart put it, retributive justice\n\n\nappears to be a mysterious piece of moral alchemy in which the\ncombination of the two evils of moral wickedness and suffering are\ntransmuted into good. (Hart 1968: 234\u2013235)\n\n\nMoreover, some critics think the view that it is intrinsically good to\ninflict suffering is \u201cbarbaric\u201d (Tadros 2011: 63) or\n\u201cmorally repugnant\u201d (Scanlon 2013: 102).\n\nThe core retributivist response to these criticisms has to be that it\nis neither absurd nor barbaric to think that the normative valence of\nsuffering might sometimes be positive. But even if that is correct,\none must also ask whether suffering itself is valuable or if it is\nonly the suffering of punishment that matters, and whether the\nsuffering should be understood in terms of objective deprivations or\nsubjective suffering.\n4.3.1 The variable normative valence of suffering\n\nRetributivists think that deserved suffering should be distinguished\nfrom non-deserved suffering. While the latter is inherently bad, the\nformer, at least if inflicted by a proper punitive desert agent, is\ninherently good (Hegel 1821: \u00a799; Zaibert 2018: chs. 2 & 3;\nAlexander & Ferzan 2018: 184\u2013185). Just as grief is good and\nmorally valuable when a loved one has died, so suffering might be good\nand morally valuable when experienced by a wrongdoer, especially if\nexperienced in a way that is appropriately connected to having\ncommitted a particular wrong. Of course, it would be better if there\nwere no occasion to inflict suffering, but given that a wrong has been\ncommitted, inflicting deserved suffering in response is better than\nnot doing so. (For another example of something with a variable\nnormative valence, see Kant's doctrine of the highest good: happiness\nin proportion to virtue. Kant 1788 [1956: 115].)\n\nVictor Tadros (2013: 261) raises an important concern about this response to Hart's objection, namely that if a person were already suffering, then the situation might be made better if the person engaged in wrongdoing, thereby making the suffering valuable. One way to avoid this unwanted implication is to say that the negative value of the wrong would outweigh any increased value in the suffering, and that the wronging is still deontologically prohibited, even if it would somehow improve the value picture (see Alexander & Ferzan 2018: 187\u2013188). But this reply leaves intact the thought that something valuable nonetheless occurs if a suffering person commits a crime: her suffering at least now fits (see Tadros 2015: 401-403). Insofar as retributivists should find this an unwanted implication, they have reason to say that suffering is valuable only if it is meted out for a wrong done. This connection is the concern of the next section.\n4.3.2 Suffering in the abstract versus suffering through punishment\n\nSome retributivists take the view that what wrongdoing calls for is\nthe wrongdoer's suffering, whatever causes it. As Mitchell Berman\nwrites (2013: 87), \u201cthe dominant retributivist view\u201d is\n\u201cthat what wrongdoers deserve is \u2018to suffer\u2019\u201d\n(see also Zaibert 2013: 43 n.19; but see Kleinig 1973: 67, discussing\nthe value of imposing suffering). Even though Berman himself\ndoes not quite embrace that view, he embraces a close cousin, namely\nthat a wrongdoer deserves that her life \u201cgo less well [than it]\nwould have otherwise gone\u201d (2013: 104).\n\nThere is something intuitively appealing, if one has retributive\nintuitions, about the thought that it is better if a\nwrongdoer\u2014especially one who has committed serious\nwrongs\u2014lives miserably than if she lives happily. There is\nsomething galling, if one feels the retributive impulse, in the\nthought that she might \u201cget away with it\u201d. Nonetheless, it\nis important to distinguish the thought that it is good to punish a\nwrongdoer so that she does not \u201cget away with it\u201d, from\nthe thought that it is better that she suffer than that she live\nhappily, even if the suffering is not inflicted by punishment. The\nlatter thought may draw on the same emotional wellspring as\nretributivism. But a retributivist\u2014at least one who rejects the\nfantasy that God inflicts such suffering as a matter of cosmic\njustice\u2014should not base her conception of retributivism on\nit.\n\nIf retributivism were based on the thought that wrongdoers' suffering\nis good in itself, then punishment is not necessary as a bridge\nconnecting the suffering and the individual bad acts. If the\nconnection between individual bad acts and suffering is lost, then\nretributivists are left with the need to keep a whole-life ledger of\ngood and bad acts, for which they want a person to have the\nappropriate amount of whole-life happiness or suffering (Ezorsky 1972:\nxxvi; Tadros 2011: 68). But the idea of tracking all of a person's\ngood and bad deeds, and all of her happiness or suffering, and aiming\nto align them is problematic. It suggests that one could bank good\ndeeds and \u201cearn the ability to commit misdeeds with\nimpunity\u201d (Alexander 2013: 318). Such banking should be\nrejected, even though it is plausible that performing heroic deeds\nafter having committed a wrong mitigates the punishment deserved.\n4.3.3 Subjective suffering or measures expected to cause suffering\n\nAdam Kolber, no retributivist, argues that retributivists cannot\nignore the subjective experience of punishment.\n\n\nTo be retributively punished, the person punished must find the\npunishment aversive and the severity of the punishment is at least\npartly a function of how aversive he finds it. (2009: 215)\n\n\nKolber continues:\n\n\nRetributivists who fail to consider variation in offenders' actual or\nanticipated experiences of punishment are not measuring punishment\nseverity properly and are therefore punishing disproportionally.\n(2009: 215; see also Bronsteen et al. 2009: 1068\u20131072)\n\n\nYet, as Kolber points out, accommodating such variation would be\nintuitively problematic for retributivists. It would call, for\nexample, for short sentences for those who would suffer a lot in\nprison and for extra harsh treatment for those who find prison easy to\nhandle. This is a far cry from current practice. (For retributivists\nwho agree and think the practice should be reformed, see Alexander\n& Ferzan 2018: 199.)\n\nMany retributivists disagree with Kolber's claim that the subjective\nexperience of suffering of particular individuals should be a\nsignificant concern for them. As Andrew von Hirsch and Andrew Ashworth\nput it:\n\n\nWhat makes punishments more or less onerous is not any identifiable\nsensation; rather, it is the degree to which those sensations\ninterfere with people's legitimate interests\n\n\n\u2014interests people generally share, such as in\n\n\nfreedom of movement, choice regarding \u2026 activities, choice of\nassociates, privacy, and so on. (von Hirsch & Ashworth 2005: 147;\nsee also Gray 2010; Markel & Flanders 2010)\n\n\nBut this response, by itself, seems inadequate. Surely Kolber is right\nthat the subjective experience of punishment as hard\ntreatment is part of its point, and that variation in that experience\nis something that needs to be justified.\n\nA second way to respond to Kolber's argument is to reject the premise\nthat retributivists must justify imposing greater subjective suffering\non some rather than others as a matter of retributive\njustice. As was pointed out in\n section 2.1,\n punishment must be intentional; what results as a mere side-effect of\npunishment is not itself part of the punishment. Retributivists can\nintend to impose punishments that will generally be experienced as\nmore severe\u2014for example, longer prison terms or more austere\nprisons\u2014the more serious the wrong for which they are imposed,\nknowing but not intending that different people will experience the\nsame term in the same prison differently.\n\nThe retributivist can then justify causing excessive suffering in some\npeople\u2014too little suffering is less objectionable\u2014if three\nconditions obtain:\n\n the punishment that leads to it is itself deserved,\nthe importance of giving wrongdoers what they deserve\u2014both\nthe intrinsic importance in terms of retributive justice and the\nextrinsic importance in terms of other goods, such as deterrence and\nincapacitation thereby achieved\u2014is sufficiently high to outweigh\nthe bad of excessive suffering, and\n the problems with eliminating excessive suffering are too great\nto be overcome without excessive costs to other morally important\nends.\n\n\nThese conditions call for a few comments. First, the excessive\nsuffering in condition (b) should be incidental excessive suffering.\nIf it is suffering that is intentionally inflicted to achieve some\nother end, then it will be as hard to justify as punishing the\ninnocent. Second, there is reason to think these conditions often\nobtain. Focusing only on the last condition, there are at least four\nreasons to think it obtains: individual tailoring of punishment \n\n invites gaming the system; \n would be perceived by some as unfair because those who claim to\nbe extra sensitive would seem to be given undue leniency, and that\nwould lead to resentment and extra conflict; \n would undermine predictability, which would arguably be unfair to\npeople contemplating a crime in the same way that ex post\nfacto increases in punishment are considered unfair; and \n would likely lead to abuse of power.\n\n\n(For responses to an earlier version of this argument, see Kolber\n2019: 584\u2013586.)\n\nIt might also often be less problematic to cause excessive suffering\nthan it may at first seem if people are to some degree responsible for\ntheir own hypersensitivity\u2014compare Rawls's thought that people\nare responsible for their own preferences (Rawls 1975 [1999:\n261]).\n\nThat said, the state should accommodate people who would\nsuffer extreme trauma from normal punishments. For example, someone\nwho is extremely sensitive to the cold should be given extra clothing\nand blankets or a space heater. But that does not imply that the\npunishers should try, in general, to tailor the subjective experience\nof suffering to be proportional to the crime.\n4.4 Proportionality\n\nRetributive justice holds that it would be unjust to punish a\nwrongdoer more than she deserves, where what she deserves\nmust be in some way proportional to the gravity of her crime.\nInflicting disproportionate punishment wrongs a criminal in much the\nsame way as, even if not quite as much as, punishing an innocent\nperson wrongs her (Gross 1979: 436).\n\nOne might wonder how a retributivist can be so concerned with\ndisproportionately punishing while also tolerating the known\ninfliction of excessive suffering (see\n section 4.3.3).\n But there is an important difference between the two: an agent\ninflicting punishment may come to know that a particular individual is\nsuffering more than most would from a particular punishment, but she\nshould see that as just an unfortunate side effect of inflicting a\nproportional punishment; she must aim, however, at inflicting only a\nproportional punishment.\n\nThe possibility of punishing less than deserved is also\nnormatively significant, but it provides a much weaker constraint.\nFirst, it does not seem to wrong anyone in particular (see\nDuus-Otterstr\u00f6m 2013: 472\u2013475). One might think that the\nvictims of crime are wronged if wrongdoers are not punished. But the\nview that it wrongs victims not to punish wrongdoers confuses\nvengeance, which is victim-centered, with retributivism, which is\nagent-centered: concerned with giving the wrongdoer the punishment\nshe deserves (see Paul Robinson's 2008 contrast between\nvengeful and deontological conceptions of deserved punishment).\nSecond, it is clear that in any criminal justice system that allows\nplea-bargaining, intentional deviations below desert will have to be\ntolerated. Russell Christopher (2003) has argued that retributivists\ncannot accept plea-bargaining. But he bases his argument on a number\nof unsound assumptions, including that \u201c[r]etributivism imposes\nan absolute duty to punish culpable wrongdoers whenever the\nopportunity arises\u201d (2003: 101), and that punishing a wrongdoer\nless than she deserves violates her \u201cright to punishment\u201d\n(2003.: 128\u2013129). Both of these have been rejected above.\nChristopher correctly notes that retributivists desire to treat\nequally culpable people alike (2003: 131). But this could be simply\nbecause they desire to give people the treatment they deserve in some\nnon-comparative sense (Alexander and Ferzan 2018: 181), not because\nthey care about equality per se.\n\nThis leaves two fundamental questions that an account of\nproportionality must address: how should we measure the gravity of a\nwrong, and how can a punishment be \u201cproportional\u201d to it?\nThese are addressed in the supplementary document:\n Challenges to the Notion of Retributive Proportionality.\n4.5 Strength of retributive reasons\n\nHow strong are retributive reasons? As was argued in\n section 3.3,\n even if they are weak, the presence of positive desert makes a\ndifference to the justification of punishment. It might affect, for\nexample, how one understands the forfeiture of the right not\nto be punished. It is a separate question, however, whether positive\ndesert carries much weight in establishing an all-things-considered\nreason to punish.\n\nTo be more precise, there are actually two ways the strength or\nweakness of retributive reasons can be significant. It may affect\nwhether an individual wrongdoer should be punished, even if no\ninstrumental good (primarily deterrence and incapacitation) would\nthereby be achieved, assuming that the institutions for punishment are\nin place. But it may also affect whether institutions of punishment\nshould be established, even if no instrumental goods would thereby be\nachieved. It may be relatively easy to justify punishing a wrongdoer\nby appeal to positive desert, even if her punishment yields no\ninstrumental benefits, if the institutions of punishment are already\nup, running, and paid for (Moore 1997: 100\u2013101; Husak 2000:\n995). It is another matter to claim that the institutions of\npunishment, given all their costs, can be justified by positive desert\nalone. The point of saying this is not to suggest, in the spirit of\nHart (1968: 9) that the justification of institutions of criminal\njustice should be purely consequentialist. The retributivist sees\ndesert as a reason for setting up the institutions as well as for\npunishing the individual wrongdoer (Moore 1997: 154). The point is\nmerely that one should be clear about just what one is assessing when\nweighing costs and benefits.\n\nThe primary costs of establishing the institutions of criminal\npunishment are:\n\nFinancial: (according the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics,\nstates spent over $51 billion on corrections in 2015) with\ncorresponding opportunity costs (that money could have been spent on\nschools, medical research, infrastructure, or taxpayer refunds, to\nname only a few alternatives);\nErrors (convicting the innocent, over-punishing the guilty, and\npunishing those who deserve no punishment under laws that\novercriminalize);\nThe risk of the abuse of power (political and other forms of\noppressive uses of the criminal justice system); and\nCollateral harm to innocents (e.g., the families of convicts who\nlose the support from those who are punished). (See Husak 2000 for the\nfirst three.)\n\n\nIt is implausible that these costs can be justified simply by the\nimportance of punishing wrongdoers as they deserve to be punished. The\nonly plausible way to justify these costs is if criminal punishment\nhas large instrumental benefits in terms of crime prevention (Husak\n2000; Cahill 2011; Lippke 2019).\n4.6 Retributive consequentialism versus retributive deontology\n\nRetributivism seems to contain both a deontological and a\nconsequentialist element. Its negative desert element is\ndeontological. It is a conceptual, not a deontological, point that one\ncannot punish another whom one believes to be innocent\n (section 2.1).\n But it is a deontological point that an avenue of justification for\nhard treatment is opened up, making permissible what might otherwise\nhave been impermissible, if that person is guilty and therefore\nforfeits her right not to be so treated.\n\nInsofar as retributivism holds that it is intrinsically good if a\nlegitimate punisher punishes the guilty, it seems to have a\nconsequentialist element as well. This good has to be weighed against\nother possible goods to decide what it would be best to do (Cahill\n2011). Thus, most retributivists would accept that it is justifiable\nto forego punishing one deserving person if doing so would make it\npossible to punish two equally deserving people, or one more deserving\nperson\u2014as happens on a regular basis in plea-bargaining (Moore\n1997: 157\u2013158; Berman 2011: 451\u2013452; see also\n section 4.4).\n\nBerman (2011) has argued that retributivism can appropriately be\nunderstood not just as having a consequentialist element, but as\nhaving an instrumentalist element, namely that punishment is a\nvaluable tool in achieving the suffering that a wrongdoer deserves.\nBut he argues that retributivism can also be understood as\nnon-instrumentalist if the desert object is punishment, not suffering.\nIt would be non-instrumentalist because punishment would not be a\nmeans to achieving the good of suffering; it would be good in itself.\nAs argued in\n section 4.3,\n punishment, not suffering, should be thought of as the proper\nretributive desert object, and thus the instrumentalist conception\nshould be rejected.\n5. The Question of Justification\n\nThe principal focus of concern when it comes to justifying\nretributivism is justifying its desert object. The question is: if we\ncan assume that the institutions of punishment can be justified all\nthings considered, can we justify the claim that wrongdoers deserve\ncensure and hard treatment?\n\nCensure is surely the easier of the two. It respects the wrongdoer as\na responsible agent to censure her, and it respects the victim (if\nthere is one) to stand up for her as someone whose rights should have\nbeen respected. The core challenge for justifying retributivism, then,\nis justifying the claim that hard treatment is equally deserved.\n\nAs Michael Moore (1997: 106) points out, there are two general\nstrategies for justifying retributive hard treatment: (1) showing how\nsuch treatment \u201cfollows from some yet more general principle of\njustice that we think to be true\u201d, and (2) showing that it fits\nwith a theory of punishment that \u201cbest accounts for those of our\nmore particular judgments that we also believe to be true\u201d.\nThese will be handled in reverse order.\n5.1 Conformity with our considered judgments\n\nThe argument here has two prongs. First, most people intuitively think\nthat it is important to punish wrongdoers with proportional hard\ntreatment, even if no other good would thereby be brought about.\nSecond, there is no reason to doubt that these intuitions are\nreliable.\n\nIt seems clear that the vast majority of people share the retributive\nintuition that makes up the first prong (Moore 1997: 101). Consider\nagain the example of the incapacitated rapist mentioned in\n section 1.\n The intuition is widely shared that he should be punished even if\ndoing so is expected to produce no consequentialist good distinct from\nhim getting the punishment he deserves.\n\nThe weakness of this strategy is in prong two. One might suspect that\nretributive intuitions are merely the reflection of emotions, such as\na thirst for vengeance, that are morally dubious. They may be deeply\ngrounded in our species as part of our evolutionary history, but that\nfact by itself is insufficient to consider them morally\nreliable\u2014compare other deeply engrained emotional impulses, such\nas tribalism, that are clearly morally problematic (Bloom 2013).\nMoreover, the label \u201cvengeance\u201d is not merely used as a\npejorative; a retributive or vengeful response to wrongdoing has to\nconfront moral arguments that it is a misplaced reaction. Foremost\namong these is the argument that we do not really have free\nwill\u2014see\n section 4.1.3.\n Respect for the dignity of wrongdoers as agents may call for\ncensuring them when they do wrong, and with requiring them to make\nreparations when those can be made. It is unclear, however, why it\ncalls, in addition, for hard treatment. Rather, sympathy for\nwrongdoers as products of their biology and environment seems to call\nfor mercy and forgiveness (for a contrary view, see Levy 2014).\n\nMoore (1997: 145) has an interesting response to this sort of\ncriticism. He turns to the first-person point of view. He imagines\nthat he has committed some horrible violent crime, and then says that\nhe hopes his response \u201cwould be that I would feel guilty unto\ndeath\u201d. As a result, he hopes that he would welcome\npunishment for having committed such a crime. Moore then turns the\ntable and says that one should resist the \u201celitist and\ncondescending\u201d temptation to withhold that judgment from others\n(1997: 148).\n\nThis is a rhetorically powerful move, but it is nonetheless open to\nfour objections. First, it presupposes that one can infer the\npropriety of the third-person reaction of blame and punishment from\nthe first-person reaction of guilt and self-punishment. But\nthere are things a person should do to herself that others should not\nfeel equally free to do to her (Duff 2007: 383; Zaibert 2018:\n94\u201395). Second, it may reflect only the imagination of a person\nwho has committed no such serious crimes, rather than the insight of a\nperson who knows what it is like to have committed a serious crime and then\ntried to come to terms with himself. Third, it equates the propriety\nof feeling or inflicting guilt with the propriety of adding punishment\nto guilt. But why is guilt itself not enough (see Husak 2016:\n59\u201360)? Fourth, one can question whether even the reaction of\nguilt is a morally sound one. Might it not be a sort of sickness, as\nNietzsche (1887 [2006: 60]) put it, \u201cbad conscience, \u2026\nthe will to self-violation\u201d.\n\nConsider what Jeffrie Murphy (2007: 18) said, as a mature philosopher,\nlooking back on his own efforts to justify retributivism:\n\n\n[M]y enthusiasm for settling scores and restoring balance through\nretributive justice may in part have been extensions of what Nietzsche\ncalled \u201ca soul that squints\u201d\u2014the soul of a\nshopkeeper or an accountant. If I had been a kinder person, a less\nangry person, a person of more generous spirit and greatness of soul,\nwould robust retributivism have charmed me to the degree that it at\none time did? I suspect not.\n\n\nThe point is not to say that this first justificatory strategy fails.\nIt is to say that it does not obviously succeed. The notion of\nretributive justice would be on sounder footing if this justification\nwere supplemented by a theoretical justification for punitive hard\ntreatment that ties it to a more general set of principles of justice.\nDoing so would help dispel doubts that retributive intuitions are the\ncrabbed judgments of a squinty, vengeful, or cruel soul.\n5.2 Fairness and free riding\n\nArguably the most popular theoretical framework for justifying\nretributivism in the past fifty years or so has been Herbert Morris's\n(1968) appeal to fairness. The argument starts with the thought that it is to our mutual\nbenefit to live in society, and that to be in society, we have to\naccept certain limits on our behavior. It then continues with this claim:\n\n\nIf a person fails to exercise self-restraint even though he might\nhave\u2026 he renounces a burden which others have voluntarily\nassumed and thus gains an advantage which others, who have restrained\nthemselves, do not possess. (1968: 33)\n\n\nIt concludes with the thought that his unfair advantage should be erased by \u201cexacting the\ndebt\u201d (1968: 34). This is done with hard treatment.\n\nThough influential, the problems with this argument are serious. First,\nit is unclear that criminals have advantages that others have\nforsaken. Suppose someone murders another in a moment of anger,\ntriggered by a minor offense. Does he get the \u201cadvantage\u201d\nof getting to express his anger? What if most people feel they can\nexpress their anger sufficiently in such situations by expressing it\nin words? Then it seems that the only advantage he has is being able\nto express his anger violently. But if most people do not, at least\nnot upon reflection, wish to do that sort of thing, then he is not\nrenouncing a burden that others too wish to renounce.\n\nEven if there is some sense in which he gains an advantage over\nothers, such as the advantage of being free to use violence, what\nwould then be the proper measure of bringing him back in line? To see\nthe problem, compare how \u201cfar ahead\u201d such a murderer is\nlikely to get to how \u201cfar ahead\u201d someone might get by\neconomic fraud. Fraud may produce a much greater advantage, but we\nnormally think that violence is the greater crime. (Davis 1993\nchallenges this framing of the advantage gained, suggesting the right\ntest is the value a crime would find at an auction of licenses to\ncommit crimes; Shafer-Landau 1996: 303 rejects this solution as\nequally implausible.)\n\nMore problematically yet, it seems to be fundamentally missing the\npoint to say that the crime of, for example, murder is, at bottom,\nfree riding rather than unjustly killing another. (For these and\nrelated criticisms, see Braithwaite & Pettit 1990: 158\u2013159;\nDolinko 1991: 545\u2013549; Murphy 2007: 13\u201314.)\n\nAn alternative interpretation of Morris's idea is that the relevant\nbenefit is the opportunity to live in a relatively secure state, and\nthe wrong is not the gaining of an extra benefit but the failure to\naccept the burdens that, collectively, make that benefit possible.\nPunishment then removes the benefit that the wrongdoer cannot fairly\nlay claim to, having shirked the burden that it was her due to carry\n(see Westen 2016). This interpretation avoids the first of the\nproblems outlined above. But it still has difficulty accounting for\nthe thought that a crime such as murder is not fundamentally about\nfree riding. Moreover, it has difficulty accounting for proportional\npunishment in a plausible way. Presumably, the measure of a\nproportional punishment would be something like this: the greater the\nshirking of one's duty to accept the burdens of self-restraint, the\nlarger should be one's punishment. But how do we measure the degree of\nshirking? By the harm one causes or risks causing, by the benefit one\nreceives, or by the degree to which respecting the burden shirked\nwould have been burdensome? Only the first corresponds with a normal\nretributive notion of punishment, but this alternative reading seems\nto point to one of the latter two meanings as the measure of unjust\ngain. In addition, this view seems to imply that one who entered a\nsecure society from some sort of failed state, and who has not yet\nbenefited from the secure state, cannot be punished if she commits\nviolent criminal acts in the secure state. This is quite an odd\nimplication, though one that a social contract theorist might be\nwilling to accept.\n\nFor another attempt to develop a better Morris-like view, making the\nwrong the undermining of the conditions of trust, see Dimock 1997: 41.\nFor a criticism, see Korman 2003. For an attempt to build on Morris's\nidea, translating the basic wrong into flouting legitimate, democratic\nlaw, see Markel 2011.\n5.3 Vindicating victims by defeating wrongdoers\n\nJean Hampton tried to improve upon the unfair advantage theory by\nfocusing on the idea that what wrongdoers (at least those who have\nvictims) do is an affront to the victim, not just to the\nwhole community. Her view is that punishment must somehow annul this\naffront. As she puts it:\n\n\nIf I have value equal to that of my assailant, then that must be made\nmanifest after I have been victimized. By victimizing me, the\nwrongdoer has declared himself elevated with respect to me, acting as\na superior who is permitted to use me for his purposes. A false moral\nclaim has been made\u2026 The retributivist demands that the false\nclaim be corrected. The lord must be humbled to show that he isn't the\nlord of the victim. \u2026 [R]etributive punishment is the defeat of\nthe wrongdoer at the hands of the victim (either directly or\nindirectly through an agent of the victim's, e.g., the state) that\nsymbolizes the correct relative value of wrongdoer and victim. It is a\nsymbol that is conceptually required to reaffirm a victim's equal\nworth in the face of a challenge to it. (Murphy & Hampton 1988:\n125\u2013126)\n\n\nThis theory too suffers serious problems. First, why think that a\nwrongful act seriously challenges the equal moral standing of all? It\nmay imply that the wrongdoer thinks of himself as above either the law\nin general or his victim in particular. But he's simply mistaken.\nUnless there is a danger that people will believe he is right, it is\nnot clear why there is a pressing need to correct him.\n\nSecond, even if the message is offensive in a way that calls for\ncorrection, why isn't the solution simply to reaffirm the moral status\nof the victim, to censor the wrongdoer, and perhaps to require the\nwrongdoer to make compensation? The answer may be that \u201cactions\nspeak louder than words\u201d. Perhaps some punishment may then be\nnecessary to show that we really mean it when we say that he was\nmistaken. But why wouldn't it be sufficient to inflict \u201cthe\npunishment\u201d\u2014whatever that is\u2014to reinforce the point?\nIt's unclear why the punishment should rise above some baseline-level,\nin proportion with the gravity of the wrong, to show that \u201cwe\nmean it\u201d.\n\nThird, the message of equality through turning the tables seems\npeculiar. If the victim, with the help of others, gets to take her\nturn being lord, it is not clear how that sends the message of\nequality, rather than simply the message that this particular\nwrongdoer lost in the competition to be \u201clord\u201d.\n\nFourth, Hampton seems to have fallen into a trap that also was a\nproblem for Morris, namely substituting one wrong for another. The\nwrong of being raped is not the message that the rapist\nsends; it is the rape. (For variations on these criticisms, see\nDolinko 1991: 551\u2013554; for Hampton's replies to her critics, see\nHampton 1992.)\n5.4 Communication theories\n\nAntony Duff (2001 and 2011) offers a communication theory according to\nwhich punishment is necessary to communicate censure for wrongdoing.\nIt might be objected that his theory is too narrow to provide a\njustificatory framework for retributivism generally, because it is\nframed as a theory for legal punishment, meted out by a state\nthat governs a community of equal citizens. (The same applies to the\nsimilar theory developed by Markel 2011.) But arguably it could be\nextended to any community.\n\nPutting the narrowness issue aside, two questions remain. The first is\nwhether it is constructive for the sort of community that Duff strives\nto preserve to condemn wrongdoers. As Lacey and Pickard (2015a) put\nit, stigmatizing offenders with condemnation alienates them from\nsociety (and they are likely alienated already) and undermines their\npotential to see themselves as eventually redeemed. To this worry,\nDuff may be able to respond that the form of condemnation he has in\nmind is nothing more than treating wrongdoers as responsible for their\ncriminal acts.\n\nBut this then leads to a second question, namely whether Duff\u2019s\ntheory can account for hard treatment. As Duff raises the issue:\n\n\nCensure can \u2026 be communicated by \u201chard treatment\u201d\npunishments \u2026\u2014by imprisonment, by compulsory community\nservice, by fines and the like, which are burdensome independently of\ntheir censorial meaning\u2026: but why should we choose such methods\nof communication, rather than methods that do not involve hard\ntreatment? (Duff 2013)\n\n\nOne answer he gives is that:\n\n\n[P]enal hard treatment [is] an essential aspect of the enterprise of\nmoral communication itself. Punishment, on this view, should aim not\nmerely to communicate censure to the offender, but to persuade the\noffender to recognize and repent the wrong he has done, \u2026 and\nto make apologetic reparation to those whom he wronged. [The] hard\ntreatment aspects [of his punishment], the burden it imposes on him,\nshould serve both to assist the process of repentance and reform, by\nfocusing his attention on his crime and its implications, and as a way\nof making the apologetic reparation that he owes. (2013)\n\n\nThe problem, however, as Duff is well aware, is that it is not clear\nwhy \u201chard treatment [is] a necessary aspect of a\ncommunicative enterprise\u201d (2013, emphasis added). Indeed, Lacey\nand Pickard (2015a) suggest that hard treatment actually interferes\nwith the communicative enterprise.\n\nOne might think it is enough for retributivist accounts of punishment\nif hard treatment can constitute an important part of\ncommunicating to both the wrongdoer and the rest of the community the\ncensure that the wrongdoer deserves. The worry, however, is that it\nmay not suffice to say that hard treatment is one possible method of\ncommunicating censure. Given the normal moral presumptions against\nimposing suffering on others, it may be necessary to show that censure\nalone, unaccompanied by extra suffering, cannot be fully or\nproperly communicated. This may be very hard to show. Though the\npossibility that the value of suffering may depend on the context in\nwhich it is experience or inflicted\u2014see\n section 4.3.1\u2014may\n lighten the burden of proof.\n6. Conclusion\n\nRetributive justice has a deep grip on the punitive intuitions of most\npeople. Nevertheless, it has been subject to wide-ranging criticism.\nArguably the most worrisome criticism is that theoretical accounts\nof why wrongdoers positively deserve hard treatment are inadequate. If\nthey are inadequate, then retributive justice provides an incomplete\ntheory of punishment, one that at most explains why wrongdoers deserve\ncensure. Even the idea that wrongdoers forfeit the right not to be\nsuffer proportional hard treatment might be better explained by appeal\nto other explanations of why hard treatment (1) is instrumentally\nvaluable, and (2) is consistent with respect for the wrongdoer.\n\nThe question is, what alternatives are there? Consider, for example,\nthe proposal to replace moral desert with something like institutional\ndesert, i.e., desert based on what the institution prescribes without\nappeal to a prior notion of moral desert. According to this proposal,\na wrongdoer cannot reasonably complain that institutions that threaten\npunishment if she does wrong, and then follow through on the threat if\nshe is duly convicted of wrongdoing, treat her unjustly (Quinn 1985;\nHill 1999; Finkelstein 2004; Bedau & Kelly 2010 [2019: \u00a74]).\nSurely there is utility in having such institutions, and a person\nwould normally have a fair chance to avoid punishment\u2014with the\nrare exception of false convictions\u2014simply by avoiding\nwrongdoing. Nevertheless, this sort of justification of legal\nor institutional desert cannot straightforwardly explain the\nproportionality limit that forms such a core part of the intuitive\nappeal of retributive justice. To explain why the law may not assign\nwhatever punishments the lawmakers reasonably conclude will produce\nthe best effects overall, the idea of retributive justice may be\nessential.\n\nThis limitation to proportional punishment is central to\nretributivism. The negative desert claim holds that only that much\npunishment may be inflicted, and the positive desert claim holds that\nthat much punishment, but no more, is morally deserved and in\nthat sense respectful of the wrongdoer. Unless one is willing to give\nup on the idea that morality imposes a proportionality limit and on\nthe importance of positive moral desert for justifying punishment up\nto that point as respectful of the individual\u2014both intuitively\ndifficult to give up\u2014there is reason to continue to take notion\nof retributive justice, and the project of justifying it,\nseriously.",
