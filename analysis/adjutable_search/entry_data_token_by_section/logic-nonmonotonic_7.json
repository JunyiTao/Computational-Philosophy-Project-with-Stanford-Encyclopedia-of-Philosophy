    "main_text": "Non-monotonic formalisms || Inheritance networks and argument-based approaches\n3.2 Inheritance networks and argument-based approaches\n\nWhenever we have a taxonomically organized body of knowledge, we\npresuppose that subclasses inherit properties from their superclasses:\ndogs have lungs because they are mammals, and mammals have lungs.\nHowever, there can be exceptions, which can interact in complex ways\nas in the following example: mammals, by and large, don\u2019t fly; since\nbats are mammals, in the absence of any information to the contrary,\nwe are justified in inferring that bats do not fly. But if we learn\nthat bats are exceptional mammals, in that they do fly, the conclusion\nthat they don\u2019t fly is retracted, and the conclusion that they fly is\ndrawn instead. Things can be more complicated still, for in turn, baby\nbats are exceptional bats, in that they do not fly (does that make\nthem unexceptional mammals?). Here we have potentially conflicting\ninferences. When we infer that Stellaluna, being a baby bat, does not\nfly, we are resolving all these potential conflicts based on the\nSpecificity Principle. \n\nNon-monotonic inheritance networks were developed for the\npurpose of capturing taxonomic examples such as the one above. Such\nnetworks are collections of nodes and directed\n(\u201cis-a\u201d) links representing taxonomic information.\nWhen exceptions are allowed, the network is interpreted\ndefeasibly. The following figure gives a network representing\nthis state of affair: \n\n\n\n\nIn such a network, links of the form \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) represent the\nfact that, typically and for the most part, As are Bs,\nand that therefore information about As is more specific than\ninformation about Bs. More specific information overrides more\ngeneric information. Research on non-monotonic inheritance focuses on\nthe different ways in which one can make this idea precise. \n\nThe main issue in defeasible inheritance is to characterize the set of\nassertions that are supported by a given network. It is of course not\nenough to devise a representational formalism, one also needs to\nspecify how the formalism is to be interpreted. Such a\ncharacterization is accomplished through the notion of an\nextension of a given network. There are two competing\ncharacterizations of extension for this kind of networks, one that\nfollows the credulous strategy and one that follows the skeptical one.\nBoth proceed by first defining the degree of a path through the\nnetwork as the length of the longest sequence of links connecting its\nendpoints; extensions are then constructed by considering paths in\nascending order of their degrees. We are not going to review the\ndetails, since many of the same issues arise in connection with\n Default Logic\n (which is discussed below), but\n Horty (1994)\n provides an extensive survey. It is worth mentioning that since the\nnotion of degree makes sense only in the case of acyclic networks,\nspecial issues arise when networks contain cycles (see\n Antonelli (1997)\n for a treatment of inheritance on cyclic networks). \n\nAlthough the language of non-monotonic networks is expressively\nlimited by design (in that only links of the form\n\u201cis-a\u201d \u2014 and their negations \u2014 can be\nrepresented in a natural fashion), such networks provide an extremely\nuseful setting in which to test and hone one\u2019s intuitions and methods\nfor handling defeasible information. Such intuitions and methods are\nthen applied to more expressive formalisms. \n\nIn argument-based approaches to defeasible reasoning the notion\nof a path through an inheritance network is generalized to the notion\nof an argument. Abstracting from the specifics and subtleties of\nformalisms proposed in the\n literature[3],\n an argument can be thought of in the following way. Given a\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), a set of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)-formulas\n\\(\\Gamma\\), a set of strict rules SRules of the form \\(\\phi_1,\n\\dotsc, \\phi_n \\Rightarrow \\psi\\) (where \\(\\phi_i\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are\n\\(\\mathcal{L}\\)-formulas) and a set of defeasible rules DRules\nof the form \\(\\phi_1, \\dotsc, \\phi_n \\rightarrow \\psi\\) (where\n\\(\\phi_i\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)-formulas) an\nargument \\((\\Theta, \\theta)\\) for \\(\\tau\\) is a proof of\n\\(\\tau\\) from some \\(\\Theta \\subseteq \\Gamma\\) using the rules in\nSRules and DRules. \n\nA central notion in argument-based formalism is argumentative\nattack. We can, for instance, distinguish between rebuts and\nundercuts. A rebut of an argument \\((\\Theta, \\tau)\\) is an\nargument that establishes that \\(\\tau\\) is not the case, viz. an\nargument for \\(\\neg\\tau\\). An undercut of \\((\\Theta, \\tau)\\)\nestablishes that \\(\\Theta\\) does not support \\(\\tau\\). For instance,\nthe argument that concludes that an object is red from the fact that\nit looks red, is undercut by means of the observation that that object\nis illuminated by red light\n (Pollock 1995).\n Note that in order to undercut an argument for \\(\\tau\\) one need not\nestablish that \\(\\tau\\) doesn\u2019t hold. \n\nOn an intuitive level, the basic idea is that the question whether an\nargument is acceptable concerns the question whether it is\ndefended from its argumentative attacks.\n Dung (1995)\n proposed a way to address this question purely on the basis of the\nattack relations between arguments while abstracting from the concrete\nstructure of the given arguments. Where Args is the set of the\narguments that are generated from \\(\\Gamma\\) by the rules in\nSRules and DRules, we define an attack relation\n\\({\\leadsto} \\subseteq \\mathit{Args} \\times \\mathit{Args}\\) as\nfollows: \\(a \\leadsto b\\) if and only if \\(a\\) attacks (e.g., rebuts\nor undercuts) \\(b\\). This gives rise to a directed graph, the\nabstract argumentation framework, where arguments are nodes and\narrows represent the attack relation. Note that at the level of the\ndirected graph arguments are treated in an abstract way: the concrete\nstructure of the arguments is not presented in the graph. \n\nVarious argumentation semantics have been proposed for such\ngraphs specifying criteria for selecting sets of arguments that\nrepresent stances of rational agents. Clearly, a selected set of\narguments \\(S \\subseteq \\mathit{Args}\\) should satisfy the following\nrequirements: \n\n\\(S\\) should be conflict-free, i.e., for all \\(a, b \\in\n\\mathit{Args}\\), \\(a\\) does not attack \\(b\\). \n\\(S\\) should be able to defend itself from all attackers. More\nprecisely, \\(S\\) is admissible if and only if \\(S\\) is\nconflict-free and for every \\(a \\in \\mathit{Args}\\) that attacks some\n\\(b \\in S\\) there is a \\(c \\in S\\) that attacks \\(a\\). \n\n\nFor instance, given the following graph, \n\n\n\n\n\\(\\{a\\}\\) is admissible, while \\(\\{a,b\\}\\) is not conflict-free and\n\\(\\{d\\}\\) is not admissible. \n\nGiven these basic requirements we can define, for instance, the\nfollowing semantics which frequently appears in the literature: \n\nA preferred set of arguments \\(S\\) is an admissible set of\narguments that is maximal in Args relative to set-inclusion.\n\n\n\nIn our example \\(\\{a,d\\}\\) and \\(\\{b,d\\}\\) are the two preferred sets.\nThis shows that the preferred semantics does not determine a unique\nselection. In order to define a consequence relation we can proceed\neither according to the credulous rationale or according to the\nskeptical rationale. Considering an abstract argumentation framework\nbased on \\(\\Gamma\\), SRules, and DRules, we give two\nexamples of how a consequence set can be characterized by means of the\nskeptical approach\n (Prakken 2010):\n \n\n \\(\\tau\\) is a consequence if in each preferred set \\(S\\) of\narguments there is an argument a for \\(\\tau\\). \n \\(\\tau\\) is a consequence if there is an argument a for\n\\(\\tau\\) that is in every preferred set of arguments \\(S\\). \n\n\nClearly, the second approach is more cautious. Intuitively, it demands\nthat there is a specific argument for \u03c4 that is contained in each\nrational stance a reasoner can take given \\(\\Gamma\\), DRules,\nand SRules. The first option doesn\u2019t bind the acceptability of\n\\(\\tau\\) to a specific argument: it is sufficient if according to each\nrational stance there is some argument for \\(\\tau\\). \n",
