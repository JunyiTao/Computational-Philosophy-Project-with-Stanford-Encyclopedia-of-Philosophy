    "main_text": "Metaphysical explanation as a form of non-causal explanation\n1. Metaphysical explanation as a form of non-causal explanation\n\nTo help us focus in on the topic at hand, contrast examples\n(1)\u2013(4) above with familiar examples of causal\nexplanation\u2014for instance, the disappearance of a puddle through\nevaporation because of the warmth of the surrounding air. What makes\nthis an instance of explanation is a matter for debate, although a\ngood enough approximation for our purposes is that it turns on how (in\nthis case causal) explanation works. As Lange puts it: a causal\nexplanation\n\n\nderives its explanatory power by virtue of supplying relevant\ninformation about the explanandum\u2019s causes or, more broadly,\nabout the world\u2019s network of causal relations. (Lange 2016:\n18)\n\n\nA puddle\u2019s disappearance does not merely coincide with\nthe warmth of the surrounding air, but rather occurs because\nof it, at least in part thanks to causal interactions between the two\nsystems over time.\n\nIn contrast, metaphysical explanations at least appear to work in a\nrather different manner. (1) seems to work at least in part due to\nsome relationship between Socrates and the bust of him on the one\nhand, and a fact about those two plus a further entity, a property, on\nthe other. Whatever that relationship is, it seems radically different\nfrom ordinary causal ones, for instance in being synchronic rather\nthan diachronic. The same can be said about (2), which invokes a\nsynchronic relationship between a determinable property and its\ndeterminates. Similarly, (3) seems to work at least in part due to how\nthe essential nature of a thing non-causally constrains what features\nit can have, while (4) seems to work at least in part due to there\nbeing no difference between being just and having a well-ordered soul,\nwhich would appear to preclude any causal relationships between\nthem.\n\nIt is in the minimal sense above that all should agree with the claim\nthat metaphysical explanation is a form of non-causal explanation (see\nSchaffer 2017: 303). Nonetheless, one must take care here in at least\nthree ways. First, metaphysical explanation should not be\nidentified with non-causal explanation. After all, there are\narguably many other forms of explanation besides metaphysical\nexplanation that are non-causal; we mentioned mathematical explanation\nabove. But this is not to say that metaphysical explanation has\nno role to play in how to understand these other types of\nnon-metaphysical non-causal explanations. Take, for example,\nSteiner\u2019s pioneering work on mathematical explanation, which\nstarts with the thought that \u201cto explain the behavior of an\nentity, one deduces the behavior from the essence or nature of the\nentity\u201d (Steiner 1978: 143). To the extent this works in the way\n(3) above works, by invoking the notion of essence, to that extent\nmathematical explanation involves a form of metaphysical\nexplanation.\n\nSecond, to say that metaphysical explanation is a form of non-causal\nexplanation does not mean that it is disconnected from the causal\nrealm altogether. Consider another example:\n\n(5)\nSocrates is in pain because the functional role of pain is\nrealized by the C-fibers firing in his brain.\n\n\nA functionalist about the mind might offer (5) as a part of a more\ncomprehensive metaphysical explanation of the nature of pain and its\ninstances. And yet, (5) invokes causation in at least two places. For\none thing, the explanans of (5)\u2014i.e., the fact which\ndoes the explaining\u2014invokes a type of causal process. In\naddition, the explanandum of a metaphysical\nexplanation\u2014i.e., the fact to be explained\u2014can invoke\ncausation, as for instance would be the case were one to offer up a\nmetaphysical explanation of causation itself. Thus what makes a\nmetaphysical explanation non-causal is not that the explanans or\nexplanandum are themselves non-causal, but rather that the\nrelationship between them is. For another thing, (5) works at\nleast in part due to the relationship between the functional role of a\nmental state and its realizer. So if this relationship itself consists\nin some relationship between the causal powers of a mental state and\nits realizer (perhaps the former must be a proper subset of the\nlatter; see J. Wilson 1999, Shoemaker 2001), then to that extent, (5)\nderives its explanatory power from causal facts. But (5) does not\nderive it solely from these, for presumably the relationship\nbetween the causal powers of a mental state and its realizer is not\nitself a causal one (in the case of Wilson and Shoemaker, it is the\nis a proper subset of relation).\n\nThird, although a useful starting point, it is not entirely\nuncontroversial to say that every form of metaphysical\nexplanation is a form of non-causal explanation. Take (2), which many\ntake to be a case of\n metaphysical grounding,\n the relationship by which more fundamental facts somehow \u201cgive\nrise to\u201d less fundamental ones. Although most theorists classify\ngrounding as non-causal, A. Wilson (2018) argues that grounding is\nliterally a form of \u201cmetaphysical causation\u201d, from which\nit would seem to follow that (2) is a form of causal explanation (see\n \u00a76.1\n below). Or take Bennett (2017: 61\u201362), who claims that\ncausation is an instance of what she calls \u201cmetaphysical\nbuilding\u201d, every instance of which is an instance of\nmetaphysical explanation (at least if understood as a wholly objective\nphenomenon, rather than one requiring that certain epistemic\nconditions hold; see\n \u00a75\n for more on realist vs. antirealist conceptions of metaphysical\nexplanation). Nor is our starting point, useful as it is, entirely\nunproblematic. Consider another example:\n\n(6)\nThe natural world began to exist because of the causal activity of\na supernatural being.\n\n\nDoes (6) count as a metaphysical explanation? It might seem to, given\na traditional conception of metaphysics as studying the \u201cfirst\ncauses of things\u201d (see the entry on\n metaphysics).\n And yet, it appears to work solely thanks to certain causal facts.\nBoth points can be reconciled with our framing so far. Whatever\n\u201cmetaphysical causation\u201d might be, surely it is not\ncausation of the ordinary sort that links sunlight to puddle\nevaporation over time, which is all that we meant to emphasize by\ncharacterizing metaphysical explanation as non-causal. And moreover,\nwhether to classify all explanations offered in metaphysics as\nmetaphysical explanations, rather than more narrowly as just those\nthat derive their explanatory power partly from non-causal factors, is\na matter of terminological decision not worth engaging with at length.\nClearly there is some important difference between\n(1)\u2013(5) as opposed to (6) in how they work, and that difference\nseems to have something to do with the non-causal ways in which they\nwork. That is a topic worth investigating, not whether to use\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d in the broader way or the narrower one.\n",
