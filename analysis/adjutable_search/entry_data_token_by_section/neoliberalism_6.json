    "main_text": "Liberalism\n3. Liberalism\n\nHayek, Friedman, and Buchanan see themselves first and foremost as\ndefenders of individual freedom and the freedom of small groups such\nas the family. Liberty is usually construed negatively, as when Hayek\nsays that liberty is when \u201ccoercion of some by others is reduced\nas much as possible in society\u201d (1960 [2011: 11]). Coercion\noccurs\n\n\nwhen one man\u2019s actions are made to serve another man\u2019s\nwill, not for his own but for the other\u2019s purpose. (1960 [2011:\n133])\n\n\nWe keep coercive power in check by defining a private sphere of\nindividual activity and limiting state power (Caldwell 2004: 289).\nFriedman thinks similarly. His liberalism is understood as the embrace\nof\n\n\na government that is limited primarily to preserving a legal structure\nthat allows people to cooperate voluntarily in the marketplace, and\nwhose power is dispersed. (Butler 1985: 22)\n\n\nFor Friedman, Liberals\n\n\ntake the freedom of the individual, or perhaps the family, as our\nultimate goal in judging social arrangements. (Friedman 1962b [2017:\n22])\n\n\nAnd more directly: \u201cI define freedom as the absence of coercion\nof one person by another\u201d (1987 [2017: 185]).\n\nNeoliberals do not always embrace negative conceptions of liberty\nalone. Hayek\u2019s (1960 [2011: 11]) conception of freedom can be\ninterpreted as republican, as the view that one is free when she is\nfree from arbitrary interference, since Hayek repeatedly worries about\ngovernment engaging in arbitrary controls that prevent people from\ndeveloping long-term plans. This partly explains his insistence that a\nsociety can be free only when it is governed by the rule of law, since\nwhile law typically coercively interferes, it interferes in a\nnon-arbitrary, predictable fashion (1960 [2011: 21, 153]). While\nBuchanan does not share Hayek\u2019s republican sympathies, he too\nagrees that general rules make liberty possible. Critically, none of\nthese three thinkers embrace a moralized conception of freedom where\nfreedom is the condition of a person whose rights are respected, in\ncontrast to libertarians like Nozick (1974).\n\nOne remarkably strong emphasis among neoliberals, especially Hayek, is\nthe importance of the rule of law. All persons have a right to be\ntreated as equals by the legal, administrative, and political\ninstitutions in their society. No one is to be favored according to\ntheir degree of social influence or social power or inherited status.\nWhen people are not protected by the rule of law, their freedoms are\nintolerably restricted because they can be arbitrarily interfered with\nand cannot predict how they will fare in the future. This means they\ncannot make unimpeded use of the liberties that they currently\npossess. Neoliberals wield the rule of law against those who favor\nmore extensive states, including both social-democratic liberals and\nsocialists, on the grounds that extensive administrative states must\nviolate the rule of law to engage in their characteristic activities.\nHayek argues that absolutism arises from \u201cpowerful, centralized\nadministrative machinery\u201d whose professional administrative\nclass becomes \u201cthe main rulers of the people\u201d (1960 [2011:\n193]). Large bureaucracies invariably interfere, and in an arbitrary\nfashion. This dangerous logic of bureaucracy was a fundamental feature\nof Buchanan\u2019s research program, and the rule of law is his\nsolution, too. For these reasons, neoliberals believe equal treatment\nbefore the law is a central procedural liberty that persons possess\nnot only in court but whenever they are subject to state coercion.\nNeoliberals embrace limited government in part because they believe\nthat equal treatment before the law can be achieved only by limiting\ngovernment and embracing capitalist economic liberties like freedom of\ncontract, since both institutional practices allow others to follow\ngeneral rules and avoid seeking approval from an arbitrary authority\n(1960 [2011: 205, 230]).\n\nThe most common rationale for freedom in Hayek and Friedman is\n\u201cignorance\u2014we cannot be sure we are right\u201d (Friedman\n1987 [2017: 185]). As we have seen, while Friedman says he favors\n\u201ca free society because my basic value is freedom itself\u201d,\nhe nonetheless asks, \u201cHow do I justify that preference? \u2026\nIf I really knew what sin is, I could not justify it\u201d (1987\n[2017: 185]). Similarly, Hayek says that the case for individual\nfreedom\n\n\nrests chiefly on the recognition of the inevitable ignorance of all of\nus concerning a great many of the factors on which the achievement of\nour ends and welfare depends. (1960 [2011: 29]; Caldwell 2004:\n347)\n\n\nAnd even: \u201cIf we knew how freedom would be used the case for it\nwould disappear\u201d (Hayek 1960 [2011: 31]). The purpose of\nindividual freedom is to enable each person to\n\n\nmake the fullest use of his knowledge, especially of his concrete and\noften unique knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and\nplace. (1960 [2011: 156\u20137])\n\n\nFriedman focuses on ignorance of moral facts, while Hayek focuses on\nmoral ignorance, as well as ignorance about how to organize\npeople\u2019s lives, but either way, ignorance is the chief\njustification for freedom.\n\nA certain kind of epistemic humility, particularly humility about how\nto organize society and what the consequences of our preferred\npolicies will be, is essential to neoliberal thought. However, as we\nhave seen, sometimes neoliberals adopt a broader skepticism that casts\nour grasp of moral facts into doubt. We ought to see epistemic\nhumility about a wide range of non-normative social facts as an\nessential feature of neoliberal doctrine, whereas humility about moral\nfacts is less central to understanding what neoliberalism is. Thus,\nneoliberalism can be formulated apart from this broader form of moral\nskepticism.\n\nNeoliberals also stress that freedom allows people with different ends\nto cooperate and create peace (Hayek 1978: 111\u2013136). This is an\nimportant theme for Buchanan (1975). As a contractarian, he thinks\nthat the goal of agreement on constitutional rules is to end the\nHobbesian state of war and secure enough peace to establish mutual\ngains from exchange. Thus, a second rationale for extensive negative\nliberties is that they are instrumental for cooperation and peace.\n\nNeoliberals obviously embrace strong rights to private property,\nrights that apply not only to goods and services for one\u2019s own\nconsumption but to capital as well (Hayek 1988: 35; 1973: 107). The\nrationale for private property rights is similar to the general case\nfor liberal liberties that we have already discussed. Hayek (1988: 35;\n1973: 107; 1960 [2011: 35]) and Friedman (1962a [2002: 8\u20139]) in\nparticular argue that we can\u2019t fully distinguish economic from\nother liberties even conceptually. They both famously argue that\npolitical and economic freedom cannot be separated in practice either.\nThat is part of the point of Capitalism and Freedom and\narguably the central point of The Road to Serfdom. Buchanan\n(1993: 230) and Hayek (1960 [2011: 141]) also stress that private\nproperty rights allow persons to make plans, in part because private\nproperty enables people to save money and thereby become less\ndependent on employers and bureaucrats. Private property is further\nthought to be \u201can essential condition for the prevention of\ncoercion\u201d and the wide dispersal of power (Hayek 1960 [2011:\n140]). Freedom of contract is embraced for similar reasons. And to\nrespect these rights, a society will have to embrace capitalism, since\nthe exercise of these rights inexorably yield capitalist economic\narrangements, where capital is held by both capital owners and\nworkers.\n",
