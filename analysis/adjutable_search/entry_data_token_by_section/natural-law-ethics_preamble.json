    "main_text": "\n\n\u2018Natural law theory\u2019 is a label that has been applied to\ntheories of ethics, theories of politics, theories of civil law, and\ntheories of religious morality. We will be concerned only with natural\nlaw theories of ethics: while such views arguably have some\ninteresting implications for law, politics, and religious morality,\nthese implications will not be our focus here.\n\nThis article has two central objectives. First, it aims to identify\nthe defining features of natural law moral theory. Second, it aims to\nidentify some of the main theoretical options that natural law\ntheorists face in formulating a precise view within the constraints\nset by these defining features and some of the difficulties for each\nof these options. It will not, however, attempt to recount the history\nof the development of natural law thought. (For a very helpful\ndetailed history of natural law thought up to the beginning of the\nmodern period, see Crowe 1977. For a very helpful detailed history of\nnatural law thought in the modern period, see Haakonssen 1996. For an\narticle-length recap of the entire history of natural law thought, see\nHaakonssen 1992.)\n",
