    "main_text": "History of the Term and the Concept of Information || Modern Philosophy\n2.3 Modern Philosophy\n\nThe history of the concept of information in modern philosophy is\ncomplicated. Probably starting in the fourteenth century the term\n\u201cinformation\u201d emerged in various developing European\nlanguages in the general meaning of \u201ceducation\u201d and\n\u201cinquiry\u201d. The French historical dictionary by Godefroy\n(1881) gives action de former, instruction, enqu\u00eate,\nscience, talent as early meanings of \u201cinformation\u201d.\nThe term was also used explicitly for legal inquiries\n(Dictionnaire du Moyen Fran\u00e7ais (1330\u20131500)\n2015). Because of this colloquial use the term\n\u201cinformation\u201d loses its association with the concept of\n\u201cform\u201d gradually and appears less and less in a formal\nsense in philosophical texts.\n\nAt the end of the Middle Ages society and science are changing\nfundamentally (Hazard 1935; Ong 1958; Dijksterhuis 1986). In a long\ncomplex process the Aristotelian methodology of the four causes was\ntransformed to serve the needs of experimental science:\n\nThe Material Cause developed in to the modern notion of\nmatter.\nThe Formal Cause was reinterpreted as geometric form in\nspace.\nThe Efficient Cause was redefined as direct mechanical interaction\nbetween material bodies.\nThe Final Cause was dismissed as unscientific. Because of this,\nNewton\u2019s contemporaries had difficulty with the concept of the\nforce of gravity in his theory. Gravity as action at a distance seemed\nto be a reintroduction of final causes.\n\n\nIn this changing context the analogy of the wax-impression is\nreinterpreted. A proto-version of the modern concept of information as\nthe structure of a set or sequence of simple ideas is developed by the\nempiricists, but since the technical meaning of the term\n\u201cinformation\u201d is lost, this theory of knowledge is never\nidentified as a new \u201ctheory of information\u201d.\n\nThe consequence of this shift in methodology is that only phenomena\nthat can be explained in terms of mechanical interaction between\nmaterial bodies can be studied scientifically. This implies in a\nmodern sense: the reduction of intensive properties to measurable\nextensive properties. For Galileo this insight is programmatic: \n\n\nTo excite in us tastes, odors, and sounds I believe that nothing is\nrequired in external bodies except shapes, numbers, and slow or rapid\nmovements. (Galileo 1623 [1960: 276) \n\n\nThese insights later led to the doctrine of the difference between\nprimary qualities (space, shape, velocity) and secondary qualities\n(heat, taste, color etc.). In the context of philosophy of information\nGalileo\u2019s observations on the secondary quality of\n\u201cheat\u201d is of particular importance since they lay the\nfoundations for the study of thermodynamics in the nineteenth century:\n\n\n\nHaving shown that many sensations which are supposed to be qualities\nresiding in external objects have no real existence save in us, and\noutside ourselves are mere names, I now say that I am inclined to\nbelieve heat to be of this character. Those materials which produce\nheat in us and make us feel warmth, which are known by the general\nname of \u201cfire,\u201d would then be a multitude of minute\nparticles having certain shapes and moving with certain velocities.\n(Galileo 1623 [1960: 277)\n\n\nA pivotal thinker in this transformation is Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n(1596\u20131650 CE). In his Meditationes, after\n\u201cproving\u201d that the matter (res extensa) and mind\n(res cogitans) are different substances (i.e., forms of being\nexisting independently), the question of the interaction between these\nsubstances becomes an issue. The malleability of wax is for Descartes\nan explicit argument against influence of the res extensa on\nthe res cogitans (Meditationes II, 15). The fact\nthat a piece of wax loses its form and other qualities easily when\nheated, implies that the senses are not adequate for the\nidentification of objects in the world. True knowledge thus can only\nbe reached via \u201cinspection of the mind\u201d. Here the wax\nmetaphor that for more than 1500 years was used to explain\nsensory impression is used to argue against the possibility\nto reach knowledge via the senses. Since the essence of the res\nextensa is extension, thinking fundamentally can not be\nunderstood as a spatial process. Descartes still uses the terms\n\u201cform\u201d and \u201cidea\u201d in the original scholastic\nnon-geometric (atemporal, aspatial) sense. An example is the short\nformal proof of God\u2019s existence in the second answer to Mersenne\nin the Meditationes de Prima Philosophia\n\n\nI use the term idea to refer to the form of any given\nthought, immediate perception of which makes me aware of the thought.\n\n(Idea nomine intelligo cujuslibet cogitationis formam\nillam, per cujus immediatam perceptionem ipsius ejusdem cogitationis\nconscious sum) \n\n\nI call them \u201cideas\u201d says Descartes \n\n\nonly in so far as they make a difference to the mind itself when they\ninform that part of the brain.\n\n(sed tantum quatenus mentem ipsam in illam cerebri partem\nconversam informant). (Descartes, 1641, Ad\nSecundas Objections, Rationes, Dei existentiam & anime\ndistinctionem probantes, more Geometrico dispositae.)\n\n\nBecause the res extensa and the res cogitans are\ndifferent substances, the act of thinking can never be emulated in\nspace: machines can not have the universal faculty of reason.\nDescartes gives two separate motivations:\n\n\nOf these the first is that they could never use words or other signs\narranged in such a manner as is competent to us in order to declare\nour thoughts to others: (\u2026) The second test is, that although\nsuch machines might execute many things with equal or perhaps greater\nperfection than any of us, they would, without doubt, fail in certain\nothers from which it could be discovered that they did not act from\nknowledge, but solely from the disposition of their organs: for while\nreason is an universal instrument that is alike available on every\noccasion, these organs, on the contrary, need a particular arrangement\nfor each particular action; whence it must be morally impossible that\nthere should exist in any machine a diversity of organs sufficient to\nenable it to act in all the occurrences of life, in the way in which\nour reason enables us to act. (Discourse de la\nm\u00e9thode, 1647)\n\n\nThe passage is relevant since it directly argues against the\npossibility of artificial intelligence and it even might be\ninterpreted as arguing against the possibility of a universal Turing\nmachine: reason as a universal instrument can never be emulated in\nspace. This conception is in opposition to the modern concept of\ninformation which as a measurable quantity is essentially spatial,\ni.e., extensive (but in a sense different from that of Descartes).\n\nDescartes does not present a new interpretation of the notions of form\nand idea, but he sets the stage for a debate about the nature of ideas\nthat evolves around two opposite positions:\n\n\nRationalism: The Cartesian notion that ideas are\ninnate and thus a priori. This form of rationalism implies an\ninterpretation of the notion of ideas and forms as atemporal,\naspatial, but complex structures i.e., the idea of \u201ca\nhorse\u201d (i.e., with a head, body and legs). It also matches well\nwith the interpretation of the knowing subject as a created being\n(ens creatu). God created man after his own image and thus\nprovided the human mind with an adequate set of ideas to understand\nhis creation. In this theory growth, of knowledge is a priori\nlimited. Creation of new ideas ex nihilo is impossible. This\nview is difficult to reconcile with the concept of experimental\nscience.\n\nEmpiricism: Concepts are constructed in the mind\na posteriori on the basis of ideas associated with sensory\nimpressions. This doctrine implies a new interpretation of the concept\nof idea as:\n\n\nwhatsoever is the object of understanding when a man thinks \u2026\nwhatever is meant by phantasm, notion, species, or whatever it is\nwhich the mind can be employed about when thinking. (Locke 1689, bk I,\nch 1, para 8)\n\n\nHere ideas are conceived as elementary building blocks of human\nknowledge and reflection. This fits well with the demands of\nexperimental science. The downside is that the mind can never\nformulate apodeictic truths about cause and effects and the essence of\nobserved entities, including its own identity. Human knowledge becomes\nessentially probabilistic (Locke 1689: bk I, ch. 4, para 25).\n\n\nLocke\u2019s reinterpretation of the notion of idea as a\n\u201cstructural placeholder\u201d for any entity present in the\nmind is an essential step in the emergence of the modern concept of\ninformation. Since these ideas are not involved in the justification\nof apodeictic knowledge, the necessity to stress the atemporal and\naspatial nature of ideas vanishes. The construction of concepts on the\nbasis of a collection of elementary ideas based in sensorial\nexperience opens the gate to a reconstruction of knowledge as an\nextensive property of an agent: more ideas implies more probable\nknowledge.\n\nIn the second half of the seventeenth century formal theory of\nprobability is developed by researchers like Pascal (1623\u20131662),\nFermat (1601 or 1606\u20131665) and Christiaan Huygens\n(1629\u20131695). The work De ratiociniis in ludo aleae of\nHuygens was translated in to English by John Arbuthnot (1692). For\nthese authors, the world was essentially mechanistic and thus\ndeterministic, probability was a quality of human knowledge caused by\nits imperfection:\n\n\nIt is impossible for a Die, with such determin\u2019d force and\ndirection, not to fall on such determin\u2019d side, only I\ndon\u2019t know the force and direction which makes it fall on such\ndetermin\u2019d side, and therefore I call it Chance, wich is nothing\nbut the want of art;\u2026 (John Arbuthnot Of the Laws of\nChance (1692), preface) \n\n\nThis text probably influenced Hume, who was the first to marry formal\nprobability theory with theory of knowledge:\n\n\nThough there be no such thing as Chance in the world; our ignorance of\nthe real cause of any event has the same influence on the\nunderstanding, and begets a like species of belief or opinion.\n(\u2026) If a dye were marked with one figure or number of spots on\nfour sides, and with another figure or number of spots on the two\nremaining sides, it would be more probable, that the former would turn\nup than the latter; though, if it had a thousand sides marked in the\nsame manner, and only one side different, the probability would be\nmuch higher, and our belief or expectation of the event more steady\nand secure. This process of the thought or reasoning may seem trivial\nand obvious; but to those who consider it more narrowly, it may,\nperhaps, afford matter for curious speculation. (Hume 1748: Section\nVI, \u201cOn probability\u201d 1)\n\n\nHere knowledge about the future as a degree of belief is measured in\nterms of probability, which in its turn is explained in terms of the\nnumber of configurations a deterministic system in the world can have.\nThe basic building blocks of a modern theory of information are in\nplace. With this new concept of knowledge empiricists laid the\nfoundation for the later development of thermodynamics as a reduction\nof the secondary quality of heat to the primary qualities of\nbodies.\n\nAt the same time the term \u201cinformation\u201d seems to have lost\nmuch of its technical meaning in the writings of the empiricists so\nthis new development is not designated as a new interpretation of the\nnotion of \u201cinformation\u201d. Locke sometimes uses the phrase\nthat our senses \u201cinform\u201d us about the world and\noccasionally uses the word \u201cinformation\u201d. \n\n\nFor what information, what knowledge, carries this proposition in it,\nviz. \u201cLead is a metal\u201d to a man who knows the complex idea\nthe name lead stands for? (Locke 1689: bk IV, ch 8, para 4) \n\n\nHume seems to use information in the same casual way when he observes:\n\n\n\nTwo objects, though perfectly resembling each other, and even\nappearing in the same place at different times, may be numerically\ndifferent: And as the power, by which one object produces another, is\nnever discoverable merely from their idea, it is evident cause and\neffect are relations, of which we receive information from experience,\nand not from any abstract reasoning or reflection. (Hume 1739: Part\nIII, section 1)\n\n\nThe empiricists methodology is not without problems. The biggest issue\nis that all knowledge becomes probabilistic and a posteriori.\nImmanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) was one of the first to point out that\nthe human mind has a grasp of the meta-concepts of space, time and\ncausality that itself can never be understood as the result of a mere\ncombination of \u201cideas\u201d. What is more, these intuitions\nallow us to formulate scientific insights with certainty: i.e., the\nfact that the sum of the angles of a triangle in Euclidean space is\n180 degrees. This issue cannot be explained in the empirical\nframework. If knowledge is created by means of combination of ideas\nthen there must exist an a priori synthesis of ideas in the\nhuman mind. According to Kant, this implies that the human mind can\nevaluate its own capability to formulate scientific judgments. In his\nKritik der reinen Vernunft (1781) Kant developed\ntranscendental philosophy as an investigation of the necessary\nconditions of human knowledge. Although Kant\u2019s transcendental\nprogram did not contribute directly to the development of the concept\nof information, he did influence research in to the foundations of\nmathematics and knowledge relevant for this subject in the nineteenth\nand twentieth century: e.g., the work of Frege, Husserl, Russell,\nBrouwer, L. Wittgenstein, G\u00f6del, Carnap, Popper and Quine.\n",
