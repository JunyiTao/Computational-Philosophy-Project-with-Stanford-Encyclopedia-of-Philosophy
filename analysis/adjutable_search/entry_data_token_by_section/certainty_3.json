    "main_text": "Two dimensions of certainty\n4. Applications of certainty\n\nEdward Craig (1990) has argued that we can better understand the\nconcept of knowledge by examining the purpose or purposes it serves.\nIn a similar way, perhaps, the concept of certainty can be rendered\nclearer by looking at the ways in which philosophers have tried to put\ncertainty to use. Most fundamentally, certainties provide us with\ninputs to inference that are stable and secure. If they are immune to\ndoubt, they can put an end to the demand for reasons that feature in\nthe Pyrrhonist\u2019s argument for general skepticism (see Sextus\nEmpiricus, Outlines of Scepticism; Sosa 1997; Sienkiewicz\n2019). If they have probability 1, they can simplify reasoning by\nallowing the reasoner to treat them as simply given, without having to\nattend to the risk of error for each individual premise or the\naccumulation of error as uncertain premises are combined. If they are\nindefeasible, they can allow us to reject any potential\ncounterevidence as misleading.\n\nSome philosophers have argued that certainty is the norm of assertion:\none can assert that p just in case one is certain\nthat p (Stanley 2008; Peterson 2019; Beddor 2020b).\nThe norm is often defended by adapting Moore\u2019s paradox to certainty\n(Moore 1942). According to the original form of the paradox, there is\nsomething infelicitous about assertions like, \u201cIt\u2019s raining, but I\ndon\u2019t believe it is.\u201d Defenders of the certainty norm of assertion\nargue that assertions like, \u201cDogs bark, but I\u2019m not certain that they\ndo,\u201d are just as odd (Stanley 2008, p. 47). The explanation\nof this infelicity is then provided by the fact that\ncertainty is the norm of assertion. When the speaker asserts, \u201cDogs\nbark,\u201d but then goes on to deny being certain of that claim, she has\nundermined her own assertion, contradicting in practice what she has\njust said.\n\nWilliamson (2000) and Turri (2016) reject the certainty norm of\nassertion. Although a certainty version of Moore\u2019s paradox does\nsound infelicitous, it doesn\u2019t sound quite so bad as a knowledge\nversion. Moreover, the oddity of the certainty version can be\nexplained by the fact that there is generally \u201ca reluctance to allow\nthe contextually set standards for knowledge and certainty to diverge\u201d\n(Williamson 2000, p. 254). That is, the standards for what counts as\nknowledge and as certainty typically match one another. Nevertheless,\nin some contexts we can pull them apart. When that happens, Williamson\nsuggests that we assess assertions in accordance with the knowledge\nnorm. Turri (2016) reports empirical results confirming that this is\nin fact the way ordinary speakers assess assertions.\n\nSome philosophers have also argued that certainty is the norm of\npractical reasoning: one can rely on p in relevant\npractical reasoning just in case one is certain\nthat p (Beddor 2020a). The argument for the\ncertainty norm depends on two premises. First, if one is genuinely\nrelying on the premise that p, one is psychologically\ncertain that p. If one has a lower credence with respect\nto whether p, one is not in fact relying\non p but instead on the proposition that it is\nlikely that p. Second, the epistemic norm for psychological\ncertainty is epistemic certainty. To be psychologically certain with\nrespect to a proposition for which one does not have epistemic\ncertainty is to violate Hume\u2019s dictum that \u201cA wise man...proportions\nhis belief to the evidence\u201d (Hume 1748 [2007]).\n\nAlthough the second premise of the argument seems reasonable enough,\nthe first premise is overly rigorous. In many cases, the chance of a\npremise being false is negligible, though not quite zero.  We\nmight well rely on it simply because it isn\u2019t worth the effort to\nformulate a more precise premise. For example, in choosing a path to\nwalk home on a day when I am in no particular hurry, I might rely on\nthe thought that the path I\u2019m on is as good as any other--and I don\u2019t\nbother to calculate the possibility that I\u2019m wrong. Even in cases\nwhere I am, in fact, trying to be more careful, I\u2019ll often have to\nrely on an uncertain belief at some point. Suppose I\u2019m trying to\ndecide whether to rely on the proposition\nthat p but come to see that it is uncertain. So, I\npull back to the claim that it is likely that p. But I\nmay not be certain that it\u2019s likely that p. If so, I can\neither pull back even further--to the proposition that it is likely\nthat it is likely that p--or I can simply rely, albeit\ntentatively, on the proposition that p. In almost every\ncase, the latter is the more natural course of action to take.\n\nA common objection to both the claim that certainty is the norm of\nassertion and the claim that certainty is the norm of practical action\nis that certainty is scarce (see Unger 1975). If so, this will mean\nthat we rarely make proper assertions or behave in a practically\nrational way. Defenders of these norms typically respond by offering a\ncontextualist account of certainty (Stanley 2008, p. 54; Beddor 2020a,\np. 722). On such a view, the epistemic standards governing\nattributions of certainty can vary from one context to another.\n(Variations in conversational context will yield a contextualist view\nof the sort DeRose 1995 defends for knowledge attributions;\nvariations in practical context will yield a subjective-sensitive or\ninterest-relative view like those Hawthorne 2004 and Stanley 2005\ndefend with respect to knowledge.) So, what is certain in one context\nmay fail to be in another, if the relevant standards have risen in the\nlatter context. Although some contexts will have relatively stringent\nstandards for what counts as certain, others may have standards that\nare relatively lax. In the latter contexts, then, attaining certainty\nshouldn\u2019t be overly challenging.\n\nThe debate regarding contextualism is too enormous to enter into here.\nStill, it is worth asking whether certainty that is protected by the\ncontextualist strategy really should count as genuine certainty. After\nall, the idea was that a belief one knew with certainty to be correct\nwas one that made one immune from doubt full stop, and\nnot just immune from doubt in the present circumstances. It was\nsupposed to be a belief that one could rely on without hesitation in\ndrawing inferences, evaluating new evidence, and answering questions\nand challenges from others. Contextually protected certainty is\ncapable of nothing quite so stable and secure. In fact, it looks more\nlike the epistemic version of moral certainty--good enough for most\npurposes, but not as good as it might be (see Matthen 2014\nand Locke 2015 for views that more explicitly eschew the label of\n\u201cepistemic certainty\u201d in fleshing out this kind of epistemic\nstatus).\n\nPhilosophers who defend fallibilism about knowledge will be untroubled\nby this outcome (see Hetherington 2001; Reed 2013; Brown 2018). Others\nmay lament the fading of certainty as an epistemic ideal while arguing\nthat its abandonment is nevertheless better than going down to\nepistemic defeat (Pasnau 2017). A hardy few may continue to press\nahead, like Descartes, in the attempt to \u201cscale the heights of human\nknowledge\u201d (PW 1, p. 11; Klein 1981).\n",
