Moral Principles and the Boundaries of Law\n\nThe most influential criticisms of legal positivism all flow, in one\nway or another, from the suspicion that it fails to give morality its\ndue. A theory that insists on the facticity of law seems to contribute\nlittle to our understanding that law has important functions in making\nhuman life go well, that the rule of law is a prized ideal, and that\nthe language and practice of law is highly moralized. Accordingly,\npositivism\u2019s critics maintain that the most important features\nof law are not to be found in its source-based character, but in\nlaw\u2019s capacity to advance the common good, to secure human\nrights, or to govern with integrity.\n\nIt is beyond doubt that moral and political considerations bear on\nlegal philosophy. As Finnis says, the reasons we have for\nestablishing, maintaining or reforming law include moral reasons, and\nthese reasons therefore shape our legal concepts (1980 [2011:\n266\u2013273] and 1996: 204). But which concepts? If one\naccepts, as Finnis does, that the existence and content of law can be\nidentified without recourse to moral argument, and that \u201chuman\nlaw is artefact and artifice; and not a conclusion from moral\npremises\u201d (1996: 205), it becomes hard to see how the natural\nlaw theory he develops rivals rather than accommodates the truth of\nlegal positivism (see Gardner 2001, 225\u2013227). This\nvitiates also Lon Fuller\u2019s criticisms of Hart (Fuller 1958 and\n1964). Fuller has two main points. First, he thinks that it\nisn\u2019t enough for a legal system to rest on customary social\nrules, since law could not guide behavior without also being at least\nminimally clear, consistent, public, prospective and so on\u2014that\nis, without exhibiting to some degree those virtues collectively\ncalled \u201cthe rule of law\u201d. It suffices to note that this is\nconsistent with law being source-based. Even if moral properties were\nidentical with, or supervened upon, these rule-of-law properties, they\ndo so in virtue of their rule-like character. Whatever virtues inhere\nin or follow from clear, consistent, prospective, and open practices\ncan be found not only in law but in all other social practices with\nthose features, including custom and positive morality. And such\nvirtues, if they exist, are minor: there is little, if anything, to be\nsaid in favor of a clear, consistent, prospective, public and\nimpartially administered system of racial segregation, for\nexample. Fuller\u2019s second worry is that if law is a matter of\nfact, then we are without an explanation of the duty to obey. He asks\nhow \u201can amoral datum called law could have the peculiar quality\nof creating an obligation to obey it\u201d (Fuller 1958: 656). One\npossibility he neglects is that it doesn\u2019t. But even if Fuller\nis right in his unargued assumption, the \u201cpeculiar\nquality\u201d whose existence he doubts is a familiar feature of many\npractices. Compare promises: whether a society has a practice of\npromising, and what someone has promised to do, are matters of social\nfact. Yet promising creates moral obligations of performance or\ncompensation. An \u201camoral datum\u201d may indeed figure,\ntogether with other premises, in a sound argument to moral\nconclusions.\n\nWhile Finnis and Fuller\u2019s views are thus compatible with the\npositivist thesis, the same cannot be said of Ronald Dworkin\u2019s\nimportant works (Dworkin 1978, 1986 and 2011). Positivism\u2019s most\ninfluential critic rejects the theory on every conceivable level. He\ndenies that there can be any general theory of the existence\nand content of law; he denies that local theories of particular legal\nsystems can identify law without recourse to its merits, and he\nrejects the whole institutional focus of positivism. A theory of law\nis for Dworkin a theory of how cases ought to be decided and it\nbegins, not with an account of political organization, but with an\nabstract ideal regulating the conditions under which governments may\nuse coercive force over their subjects. Coercion must not be deployed,\nhe claims, \n\n\nexcept as licensed or required by individual rights and\nresponsibilities flowing from past political decisions about when\ncollective force is justified. (Dworkin 1986: 93) \n\n\nA society has a legal system only when, and to the extent that, it\nhonors this ideal, and its law is the set of all considerations that\nthe courts of such a society would be morally justified in applying,\nwhether or not those considerations are determined by any source. To\nidentify the law of a given society we must always engage in moral and\npolitical argument, for the law is whatever requirements are\nconsistent with an interpretation of its legal practices that shows\nthem to be best justified in light of this animating ideal. In\naddition to these philosophical considerations, Dworkin invokes two\nfeatures of the phenomenology of judging, as he sees it. He finds deep\ncontroversy among lawyers and judges about how important\ncases should be decided, and he finds diversity in the\nconsiderations that they hold relevant to deciding them. The\ncontroversy suggests to him that law cannot rest on an official\nconsensus, and the diversity suggests that there is no single social\nrule that validates all relevant reasons, moral and non-moral, for\njudicial decisions.\n\nDworkin\u2019s rich and complex arguments attracted various lines of\nreply from positivists. One response denies the relevance of the\nphenomenological claims. Controversy is a matter of degree, and a\nconsensus-defeating amount of it is not proved by the existence of\nadversarial argument in the high courts, or indeed in any courts. As\nimportant is the broad range of settled law that gives rise to few\ndoubts and which guides social life outside the courtroom\n(see Leiter 2009). As for the diversity argument, so far from being a\nrefutation of positivism, this is an entailment of it. Positivism\nidentifies law, not with all valid reasons for decision, but only with\nthe source-based subset of them. It is no part of the positivist claim\nthat the rule of recognition tells us how to decide cases, or even\nidentifies all relevant reasons for a decision. Positivists accept\nthat moral, political or economic considerations are properly\noperative in legal decisions, just as linguistic or logical ones are.\nModus ponens holds in court as much as outside, but not\nbecause it was enacted by the legislature or decided by the judges,\nand the fact that there is no social rule that validates both\nmodus ponens and also the Municipalities Act is true but\nirrelevant. The authority of principles of logic (or morality) is not\nsomething to be explained by legal philosophy; the authority of acts\nof Parliament must be; and accounting for the difference is a central\ntask of the philosophy of law.\n\nOther positivists respond differently to Dworkin\u2019s\nphenomenological points, accepting their relevance but modifying the\ntheory to accommodate them. So-called \u201cinclusive\npositivists\u201d (e.g., Soper, Lyons, Coleman, Waluchow (to whom the\nterm is due), Kramer and Himma) argue that the merit-based\nconsiderations may indeed be part of the law, if they are explicitly\nor implicitly made so by source-based considerations. For example,\nCanada\u2019s constitution explicitly authorizes for breach of\nCharter rights, \u201csuch remedy as the court considers appropriate\nand just in the circumstances\u201d. In determining which remedies\nmight be legally valid, judges are thus expressly told to take into\naccount their morality. And judges may develop a settled practice of\ndoing this whether or not it is required by any enactment; it may\nbecome customary practice in certain types of cases. Reference to\nmoral principles may be implicit in the web of judge-made law, for\ninstance in the common law principle that no one should profit from\nhis own wrongdoing. Such moral considerations, inclusivists claim, are\npart of the law because the sources make them so, and thus\nDworkin is right that the existence and content of law might turn on\nits merits, and wrong only in his explanation of this fact. Legal\nvalidity depends on morality, not because of the interpretative\nconsequences of some ideal about how the government may use force, but\nbecause that is one of the things that may be customarily recognized\nas an ultimate determinant of legal validity. It is the sources that\nmake the merits relevant.\n\nTo understand and assess this response some clarifications are needed.\nFirst, it is not plausible to hold that the merits are relevant to a\njudicial decision only when the sources make them so. It\nwould be odd to think that justice is a reason for decision only\nbecause some source directs an official to decide justly. It\nis of the nature of justice that it properly bears on certain\ncontroversies. In legal decisions, especially important ones, moral\nand political considerations are present of their own authority; they\ndo not need sources to propel them into action. On the contrary, we\nexpect to see a source\u2014a statute, a decision, or a\nconvention\u2014when judges are constrained not to appeal\ndirectly to the merits (see Raz 2004a). Second, the fact that there is\nmoral language in judicial decisions does not establish the presence\nof moral tests for law, for sources come in various guises. What\nsounds like moral reasoning in the courts is sometimes really\nsource-based reasoning. For example, when the Supreme Court of Canada\nsays that a publication is criminally \u201cobscene\u201d only if it\nis harmful, it is not applying J.S. Mill\u2019s harm principle, for\nwhat that court means by \u201charmful\u201d is that which is\nregarded by the community as degrading or intolerable. That\nis a source-based test, not a moral one. This is just one of many\nappeals to positive morality, i.e., to the moral customs actually\npracticed by a given society, and no positivist denies that positive\nmorality may be a source of law. Moreover, it is important to remember\nthat law is dynamic and that even a decision that does apply morality\nitself becomes a source of law, in the first instance for the\nparties and possibly for others as well. Over time, by the doctrine of\nprecedent where it exists or through the gradual emergence of an\ninterpretative convention where it does not, this gives a factual edge\nto normative terms. Thus, if a court decides that money damages are in\nsome instances not a \u201cjust remedy\u201d then this fact\nwill join with others in fixing what \u201cjustice\u201d means for\nthese purposes. This process may ultimately detach legal concepts from\ntheir moral analogs (thus, legal \u201cmurder\u201d may require no\nintention to kill, legal \u201cfault\u201d no moral blameworthiness,\nan \u201cequitable\u201d remedy may be manifestly unfair, etc.).\nBearing in mind these complications, however, there undeniably remains\na great deal of moral reasoning in adjudication. Courts are often\ncalled on to decide what would reasonable, fair, just, cruel, etc. by\nexplicit or implicit requirement of statute or common law, or because\nthis is the only proper or intelligible way to decide. When the law\nitself licenses such reasoning should we understand it, with the\ninclusive positivist, to incorporate moral standards, or, as per the\nviews of their rival, the exclusive positivist, only to make reference\nto moral principles?\n\nExclusive positivists offer two main arguments for stopping at social\nsources. The first is due to Raz (1994: 201\u201337) and has to do\nwith law\u2019s role in practical reasoning (for criticism see Perry\n1989, Waluchow 1994, Coleman 2001, Dworkin 2002, Kramer 2004 and\nHimma 2019). Although law does not necessarily have legitimate authority,\nRaz suggests it lays claim to it, and can intelligibly do so only if\nit is the kind of thing that could have legitimate authority.\nIt may fail, therefore, in certain ways only, for example, by being\nunjust, pointless, or ineffective. But law cannot fail to be a\ncandidate authority, for it is constituted in that role by\nour political practices. According to Raz, practical authorities\nmediate between subjects and the ultimate reasons for which they\nshould act. Authorities\u2019 directives should be based on such\nreasons, and they are justified only when compliance with the\ndirectives makes it more likely that people will comply with the\nunderlying reasons that apply to them. But they can do that,\nhe suggests, only if is possible to know what the directives require\nindependent of appeal to those underlying reasons. If law were to\nincorporate the moral standards to which it refers it would no longer\nbe able to play this mediating role; identifying the law would require\nidentifying the reasons underlying it. Because the nature of law is\npartly determined by its role in giving practical guidance, Raz\nconcludes, there is theoretical reason for stopping at source-based\nconsiderations.\n\nThe second argument challenges an underlying idea of inclusive\npositivism, what we might call the Midas Principle. \u201cJust as\neverything King Midas touched turned into gold, everything to which\nlaw refers becomes law \u2026\u201d (Kelsen 1945 [1961: 161]).\nKelsen thought that it followed from this principle that \n\n\nIt is\u2026possible for the legal order, by obliging the\nlaw-creating organs to respect or apply certain moral norms or\npolitical principles or opinions of experts to transform these norms,\nprinciples, or opinions into legal norms, and thus into sources of\nlaw. (Kelsen 1945 [1961: 132]) \n\n\n(Though he regarded this transformation as effected by a sort of tacit\nlegislation.) If sound, the Midas Principle holds in general and not\nonly with respect to morality, as Kelsen makes clear. Suppose then\nthat the Income Tax Act penalizes overdue accounts at 8% per annum. In\na relevant case, an official can determine the content of a legal\nobligation only by calculating compound interest. Does this make\nmathematics part of the law? A contrary indication is that it is not\nsubject to the rules of change in a legal system\u2014neither courts\nnor legislators can repeal or amend the law of commutativity. The same\nholds of other social norms, including the norms of foreign legal\nsystems. A conflict-of-laws rule may direct a Canadian judge to apply\nMexican law in a Canadian case. The conflicts rule is\nobviously part of the Canadian legal system. But the rule of Mexican\nlaw is not, for although Canadian officials can decide whether or not\nto apply it, they can neither change it nor repeal it, and the best\nexplanation for its existence and content makes no reference to\nCanadian society or its political system. In like manner, moral\nstandards, logic, mathematics, principles of statistical inference, or\nEnglish grammar, though all properly applied in cases, are not\nthemselves the law, for legal organs have applicative but not creative\npower over them. The inclusivist thesis is actually groping towards an\nimportant, but different, truth. Law is an open normative\nsystem (Raz 1975 [1990: 152\u2013154]): it adopts and enforces many\nother standards, including moral norms and the rules of social groups.\nThere is no warrant for adopting the Midas Principle to explain how or\nwhy it does this.\n\nAs noted above, Dworkin\u2019s arguments against positivism depend\nupon claims about the phenomenology of adjudication and about the\nconstraints imposed on jurisprudence by legal disagreement. Mark\nGreenberg\u2019s recent work takes as its starting point many of\nDworkin\u2019s claims, but his conclusions are in several ways more\nradical (see Greenberg 2004 and 2014). Greenberg\u2019s central\nargument against positivism is methodological: no one, he suggests,\nwould deny that the content of the law depends at least in part upon\nsocial facts. However, the question of which facts\u2014the\nsemantic content or intended effect of legislation, for\nexample\u2014cannot be answered by reference to further of the same:\n\u201claw practices\u2026cannot determine their own\nrelevance\u201d (2004: 185). Appeal must therefore be made to other\nkinds of considerations\u2014for Greenberg, considerations about the\nmoral import of our social practices. It is positivism\u2019s error\nto suggest that law could be practice-based all the way down. That the\ncontent of law depends upon social sources, however, is a truth borne\nout by law in general, as opposed to being established within local\nlegal practices. There is a categorical difference between the\nvalidity of the sources thesis\u2014a truth about law as a kind of\nsocial practice\u2014and the claim that in the UK, for example,\nstatute renders it is illegal to drive above 70 miles an hour on the\nmotorway. In this way the former explains the latter without\ncircularity, and without the need for appeal to morality.\n",
