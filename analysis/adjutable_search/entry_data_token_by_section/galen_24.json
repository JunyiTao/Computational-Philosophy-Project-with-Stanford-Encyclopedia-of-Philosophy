    "main_text": "Ethics || Rational Errors and the Good\n9. Theology\nThat Galen is some kind of theist is clear. His philosophical theology is seen especially in texts such as UP and Foet. Form., where he argues that the manifest suitedness of biological organisms and individual structures\u2014especially those observed in anatomy\u2014to their functions clearly proves their organization by some extraordinary, indeed divine, intelligence. In line with his epistemic caution, however (see \u00a73.4 above), he is not able to be specific about the nature or identity of this divine intelligence. The key feature of Galen\u2019s theology is the role it plays in teleological explanation (although, as we have seen, the teleological account is at times presented in quite strikingly anthropomorphic terms).\nYet there are traces of a more specific theological philosophy. The view of the heavenly bodies as intelligent appears both in QAM and in UP; and although it is presented in somewhat vague terms, it motivates specific philosophical arguments. The heavenly world is transcendently good and superior; yet it has an influence\u2014at some remove\u2014on our lower world. The way in which the heavenly bodies affect our world may also include astrological influence; although this is not a major part of Galen\u2019s thought, the existence of such influence is explicitly asserted, in particular in Critical Days (Di. Dec.). Consideration of the relationship between the heavenly realm and our everyday world leads to two specific types of conclusion: one, that our consciousness of the operation of a higher intelligence in this lower world should make us aware how much more admirable and perfect must be its operation in that higher one (UP XVII.1, 730); two, that there is a problem in imagining how the highest intelligence could \u201cstoop\u201d to affect the operations of the lowest level of biological organisms (Foet. Form. 6, 201). It seems possible to draw connections between these views and those of the transcedence of the highest good, and hierarchy of gods, that appear in \u201cMiddle Platonism\u201d, for example in Numenius and Alcinous (see Donini 1980; Frede 2003). Galen in UP speaks interchangeably of the purposive force of Nature (phusis) and of the Platonic Craftsman (d\u0113miourgos), and it may be argued that this entity corresponds to the second, rather than the highest, principle or god in that hierarchy.\nAgain, however, Galen is not to be forced into definitive formulations of metaphysical questions; and again the distinction must be made between the essentials about which Galen is certain\u2014here, that there is a purposive intelligence manifest throughout the universe\u2014and the specifics, speculation about which may lead ultimately to aporia.\nGalen also claims to have had personal experience of interventions by individual gods of the Greek polytheistic world within human affairs, most notably by Asclepius, the god of medicine (see Pietrobelli 2013; Singer 2019a). If it seems difficult to reconcile such a conventional, anthropomorphic manifestation of religion with the philosophical view of God as a teleological cause or as immanent Nature, it should perhaps be said that such a co-existence of abstract theology with traditional individual gods is by no means confined to Galen, amongst Graeco-Roman philosophical writers (one could mention both Plato and Epictetus in this context). In any case, it is to the divine intelligence manifest throughout the universe, rather than to any individual god, that Galen constantly returns; it is this intelligence which is the object of his religious\u2014and by the same token of his intellectual, indeed his scientific\u2014fervour.\n",
