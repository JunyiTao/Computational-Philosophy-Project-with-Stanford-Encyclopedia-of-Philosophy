Building on Hume\n\nAnother major contribution is Price\u2019s close, sympathetic\nengagement with David Hume\u2019s theoretical philosophy, especially\non our belief in the external world (1940a) as presented in (Hume\n1739\u20131740: I, iv, 2 \u201cOf Scepticism with regard to the\nSenses\u201d), which Price calls \u201cthe most brilliant thing\n[Hume] ever wrote\u201d (1940b: 16), necessary connections and\ninduction (1940b: 16ff), Hume\u2019s empiricism and its significance\n(1940b), his analysis of belief (1969: ch. 7), and comparisons between\nHume\u2019s and Buddhist no-substance views of the self (1953b: 30;\n1959c: 485). Price states (1940a: 2\u20133) that he\u2019ll treat\nHume as he would a contemporary, though he discusses him more than he\ndoes anyone else.\n",
