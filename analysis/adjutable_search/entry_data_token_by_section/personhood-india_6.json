What do we need persons for?\n\nContemporary philosophical investigation into questions about the\nnature of persons and personal identity may seem very far from these\nancient discussions in classical Indian philosophy. The\nNon-Reductionist view so popular among the mainstream Hindus is not in\nfavour these days. The most important reason to deny that we are\nseparately existing non-physical soul substances is that such things\nare impossible to trace through space-time. If we are essentially\nnon-physical souls, there still would be no way to know that you now\nare one and the same person that committed the crime at an earlier\ntime. If judgments about personal identity were grounded on judgements\nabout the identities of immaterial souls, then personal identity would\nbe completely mysterious (Perry 1978, 402\u20133). It is true that we\nsometimes lack epistemic access to metaphysical truths. But if this\nwere the right metaphysical theory it should undermine all confidence\nin our judgments of identity in a way that seems bizarre (Shoemaker\nand Tobia, forthcoming). That might seem bizarre from a contemporary\npoint of view, but the Hindu Non-Reductionists are not going to be\nworried by these objections. Most classical Indian philosophers,\nexcept the C\u0101rv\u0101kas, agree that ignorance about our own\nnatures\u2014 about who and what we are\u2014is the cause of our\nbondage in the cycle of birth and rebirth and the suffering that comes\nwith it. The Upani\u1e63adic sages were no strangers to metaphors and\nmysteries. Their strategy was to heighten the mystery associated with\nknowledge, \u201cnot so much in a self\u2010serving secretiveness or\na disinclination to share the knowledge that gives them power but as\nresponse to a deep respect for the power of that knowledge, and a\nrecognition of the need not to be frivolous either with the knowledge\nitself or with its potential recipients\u201d (Ganeri 2007,13). The\nKatha Upani\u1e63ad puts it thus: \u201cHidden in all the beings,\nthis self is not visibly displayed. Yet, people of keen vision see him\nwith eminent and sharp minds.\u201d (KU 3.12).\n\nMost contemporary philosophers assume that Reductionism is true. The\nReductionists draw inspiration from Locke, perhaps the first\nphilosopher in the history of Western philosophy to put forward a\nversion of the psychological continuity view that was developed by\nParfit. But there is another more important point that Locke brought\ncentre-stage to the discussion about personal identity: theorizing\nabout persons is motivated by a distinctive normative concern about\nmoral responsibility. Locke writes:\n\nIn this personal Identity is founded all the Right and Justice of\nReward and Punishment; Happiness and Misery, being that, for which\nevery one is concerned for himself\u2026the Apostle tells us, that\nat the Great Day, when every one shall receive according to his\ndoings, the secrets of all Hearts shall be laid open. The Sentence\nshall be justified by the consciousness all Persons shall have, that\nthey themselves in what Bodies soever they appear, or what Substances\nsoever that consciousness adheres to, are the same, that committed\nthose Actions, and deserve that Punishment for them. (Locke 1690\n[1975, 341\u2013347])\n\n\nIn the classical Indian context, as we have seen above, it is the same\nconcerns that led to the search for an eternal soul as the essence of\npersons by the Hindu philosophers and also motivated the Buddhist\npersonalists to introduce persons (pudgala) as\n\u2018burden-bearers\u2019. Classical Indian philosophers did not\ninvoke God but relied on karma to dole out just rewards and\npunishments in the course of the cycle of birth and rebirth. Normative\nconcerns about responsibility are thus an important motivating concern\nacross the East-West divide.\n\nContemporary philosophers, however, have broadened the scope of\nnormative concerns beyond that of moral responsibility. Shoemaker\n(2007, 318\u20139) helpfully presents a list of practical concerns\nthat are presumably grounded in personal identity which includes moral\nresponsibility but adds many more: anticipation of future experiences;\nspecial self-concern for one\u2019s own future self; surviving death\nand anticipation of the afterlife; compensation, maximizing utility\nintrapersonally but not interpersonally; self-conscious emotions\n(pride, regret, etc.); special non-derivative concern and\nother-regarding emotions I have for a certain limited network of\npeople, all of whom bear certain sorts of special relations to me;\nfirst-person reidentification and self-regarding emotions I have for\nmy past and future self. This long list is likely to put pressure on\nany single criterion of personal identity.\n\nThe psychological continuity criterion originally proposed by Locke\nand developed most famously by Parfit (1984) does well to account for\nmoral responsibility and anticipation of the afterlife and survival\nbut falls short on compensation and maximizing utility\nintrapersonally. The animalist or biological continuity criterion does\nnot fare well in accounting for concern about moral responsibility,\nbut it does much better on compensation and special non-derivative\nconcern and other-regarding emotions I have for a certain limited\nnetwork of people, all of whom bear certain sorts of special relations\nto me (DeGrazia 2005). These are not the only competitors though. Some\nmight suggest, as do Tierney et al., that we can be pluralists about\npersonal identity. Rather \u2018empirical evidence and philosophical\nthought experiments indicate that judgments about personal identity\nare regimented by two different criteria, one in terms of\npsychological traits and one that largely conforms to biological\ncriteria\u2019 (Tierney et al. 2014, 198). Shoemaker (2007) goes\nfurther to settle for a wide-ranging pluralism in the face of the\ndisunity of our practical concerns. But Shoemaker stops short of\ngiving up on persons and person-related concerns in the hope that\nthere is a theory (or theories!) of the relation between personal\nidentity and our person-related practices and concerns. He says,\n\u2018several concessions may be required, including admission,\nperhaps, of (a) the irrelevance of certain powerful and popular\ncriteria of personal identity for (at least some of) our practices and\nconcerns, (b) the ultimate disunity of these practices and concerns\n(such that multiple types of theories of the relation between them and\nthe metaphysics may be called for), and/or (c) the possibility of\ndifferent types of rational grounding\u2014justification and\nrendering-possible\u2014where justification may actually be off the\ntable altogether for some practices and concerns\u2019 (2007,\n354).\n\nSome others though develop a different approach to the problem of\npersonal identity which upends the debate between the supporters of\nanimalism and psychological continuity theorists. One example of such\nan approach is the \u201ccharacterisation\u201d criterion that has\nbeen recently developed by Marya Schectman (2014). In her words,\npersonal identity \u201cjust consists in the fact that the person\nbefore us now is viewed as, treated as, and acts as the same locus of\nnormative concerns as the [previous] person\u201d (Schectman 2014,\n152). Although Schectman has only four normative concerns in mind from\nthe above list (moral responsibility, special self-interested concern,\ncompensation, and survival), her move ensures that these normative\nconcerns trump any metaphysical considerations. According to\nSchectman, a person is, whatever it is, that is the locus of our\nnormative concerns. Another recent view that deserves a mention in\nthis context is the Minimalist view, defended in a series of papers by\nMark Johnston (1987, 1992, 1997). According to Minimalism, the\nmetaphysical \u201cdeep\u201d facts of personal identity are\nirrelevant to the justification of our person-related practices and\npractical concerns. Our practices are grounded not on a metaphysics of\npersons but on our circumstances and needs. Johnston writes: \u201cin\nthe particular case of personal identity, minimalism implies that any\nmetaphysical view of persons which we might have is either\nepiphenomenal or a redundant basis for our practice of making\njudgements about personal identity and organizing our practical\nconcerns around this relation\u201d (Johnston 1997, 150). The\ncharacterisation criterion and Minimalism extol the primacy of our\nnormative practices and concerns suggesting the latter\n\nmay actually authoritatively constrain, shape, or even be immune or\nirrelevant to one\u2019s theory of personal identity. This is a\ngeneral methodological dispute about the proper direction of\nargumentation in the arena of personal identity and ethics. (from\nsection 7 of the entry\n personal identity and ethics,\n Winter 2021 Edition)\n\n\nThis is, however, not the only dispute. The biggest problem is that we\nhave no settled conception of persons or personal identity. I\u2019ve\ndiscussed four different views here, and there are many more. There\nseems to be no clear winner.\n\nRevisionism about personal identity has been popular since\nParfit\u2019s Reasons and Persons. But contemporary\nphilosophers stop short of questioning our normative concerns and\npractices. Parfit flirted with revisionism about normative concerns\nabout practices in proposing the Extreme Claim, according to which,\none\u2019s moral and prudential concerns cannot be grounded without a\ndeep separate fact about personal identity. But Parfit thinks that\nanother view is also defensible. This view results from the\ncombination of reductionism with the Moderate Claim, which says that\nour moral and prudential concerns may well be grounded in what does\nmatter in personal identity. This, according to Parfit, is\npsychological connectedness and/or continuity (1984, 311). Parfit\nbelieved that the Extreme Claim is defensible, he retracted it only\nbecause he did not have an argument to defend it. But if we run with\nthe Extreme Claim it entails that our person-related practices and\nconcerns are ungrounded, period. This opens the door for\nreconsideration of our person-related practices. However, this option\nis ignored in contemporary philosophy. Philosophers, as we saw, are\nwilling to consider pluralism about criteria of personal identity,\npluralism about theories of the relation between personal identity and\nperson-related practices. Shoemaker, as we saw above, is also willing\nto consider the disunity of practices. But no one is willing to\nconsider revising the practices themselves. But why are the practices\nconsidered sacrosanct? P.F. Strawson balks at such a question. He\nwrites, \u2018I shall reply, first, that such a question could seem\nreal only to one who had utterly failed to grasp the purport of\n\u2026 the fact of our natural human commitment to ordinary\ninter-personal attitudes. This commitment is part of the general\nframework of human life, not something that can come up for\nreview\u2019 (1974: 14, emphasis added). Strawson is not only\nclaiming that it is hard for us to give up our interpersonal attitudes\nand concerns, but he also thinks to give up these would be to give up\non our humanity.\n\nA thoroughgoing revisionist willing to explore the consequences of\nendorsing the Extreme Claim would reconsider some of our\nperson-related concerns and practices and attitudes. That is exactly\nthe strategy adopted by the Abhidharma Buddhist Reductionist. Buddhist\nReductionists are willing to revisit our ordinary normative practices\nand concerns, especially those to do with self-concern and the special\nconcern that we have for those we love dearly. The Buddhists do\nrecognize that it is built-in precondition of our form of life that we\nhave self-concern and special concern for our loved ones. That is why\nthe Buddhists do not recommend giving up on this self-concern or\nspecial concern for our loved ones. Rather they recommend expanding\nsimilar concern to all others, including one\u2019s enemies. And they\ndo not think that such an expansion comes easy to us given our human\nnature: it has to be inculcated by extensive training in\n\u2018spiritual exercises\u2019 which include meditation, knowledge\nof the Buddhist texts and insight. This expansion is not to be thought\nof as the giving up of one\u2019s humanity, as feared by Strawson,\nrather the idea is to enlarge our humanity.\n\nIt is important for us to realise that any set of norms or value\nsystem is not immune to revision, just because it is, as Strawson\nputs, \u2018part of the general framework of human life\u2019. The\nproblem is that there is no such \u2018general\u2019 framework. The\nnormative concerns and practices of human societies are varied, and\nnot such as to be weighed systematically against each other. The\npractices we regard as important because they are \u2018part of the\ngeneral framework of human life\u2019 cannot be justified as having\nbeen chosen by ideally rational beings. Persons as moral beings are a\nproduct of our histories and culturally constrained preferences.\nImagine being in a world in which the Buddhist thesis of the no self\nwas widely held. Or consider a culture where the really significant\nentities are family lines, and it is axiomatic that children are\njustly to be held responsible for their parents\u2019 wrongdoing.\nWhat evidence is there against such a code, or in favour of\n\u2018our\u2019 belief that persons are separate individuals,\nresponsible for their own crimes. It is therefore not clear that we\nshould assume that all normative systems must include some special\nconcern for one\u2019s future self and those that we love dearly. The\nanticipation of one\u2019s own future self or one\u2019s survival\nare also up for question. These important assumptions that often goes\nunnoticed because they basically treated as \u201cpart of the general\nframework\u201d. Buddhist philosophy invites us to ask the question:\nIs there such a framework?\n",
