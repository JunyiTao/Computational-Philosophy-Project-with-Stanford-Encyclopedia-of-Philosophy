    "main_text": "Natural Theology || What reason cannot do\n3.1 What reason cannot do\n\nOckham had argued for stringent limits on the ability of reason to\nestablish the existence of God. While an argument for the existence of\nGod as \u201cfirst conserver\u201d of things could be made, Ockham\nhad argued against the ability of natural reason to prove there was\nonly one divine being. Holkot developed such strictures, arguing that\nunaided human reason could not prove through a strict demonstration\nthat any incorporeal being like an angel or God existed. The\nconsequence for Holkot was that any reference to such incorporeal\nbeings found in the texts of ancient philosophers must have come down\nto them from their predecessors passing on a vestige of knowledge\nabout God acquired ultimately from Adam and Eve. Holkot also contended\nthat some pagans, who lacked the law of Moses, still received faith\nand grace from God outside the Mosaic Law because they did their best\nto live according to the principles of natural law. Holkot\u2019s\nsanguine view of pagan philosophers like Hermes Trismegistus and\nAristotle rested not on their ability to use natural reason to discern\ntheological truths, but on his confidence that God had accorded a\nmeasure of revelation to more than those who had the texts of\nscripture (Slotemaker and Witt 2015, 71\u201373).\n",
