    "main_text": "Overgeneration\n8. Overgeneration\n\nMany have observed that for every implicature that appears to be\ncorrectly predicted by Gricean theory, others appear to be falsely\n predicted.[39]\n The schema used to \u201cwork out\u201d observed implicatures can\nusually be used just as well to work out nonexistent implicatures. So\nthe schema as formulated is invalid\u2014an unreliable\nmethod of inferring implicatures. By a simple application of\nMill\u2019s Methods, it follows that the observed implicatures do not\nexist because of the Gricean factors.\n\nWe will illustrate using the case that has been most extensively\nstudied, and is generally considered a paradigm application of Gricean\ntheory: the derivation of quantity implicatures from the maxim of\nQuantity. Adapted to\n (5),\n here is Huang\u2019s (2014: 34) formulation.\n\n\nSince the speaker has used a semantically weaker expression (i.e.,\nsome) where a semantically stronger one (e.g., all)\nis available, he would contradict Grice\u2019s Quantity Maxim if the\nsemantically stronger sentence held. Consequently, he believes that\nthe semantically stronger statement does not hold. Furthermore, he has\nnot done anything to stop the addressee thinking that he so thinks,\ntherefore he conversationally implicates that not all athletes\n smoke.[40]\n\n\nIn the typical case represented by\n (5),\n S says \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d and implicates\n\u201cNot all athletes smoke\u201d. The stronger statement\nS does not make is \u201cAll athletes smoke\u201d. There\nare countless relevant statements more informative than what S said,\nhowever, whose negations were not implicated, including Several\nathletes smoke, Some athletes smoke regularly, I know some athletes\nsmoke, and 13% of all athletes smoke. The Gricean\nreasoning could be repeated using any of these stronger statements,\nwith fallacious results. For example:\n\n\nS said \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d. If S were\nin a position to assert the stronger statement \u201cSeveral athletes\nsmoke\u201d but did not, S would be in a breach of the maxim\nof Quantity unless S wished to convey that it does not hold.\nSo S implicated that it is not the case that several athletes\nsmoke.\n\n\nBut speakers who utter sentences of the form \u201cSome S\nare P\u201d rarely if ever implicate the denial of\n\u201cSeveral S are\n P\u201d.[41]\n Among the infinity of statements stronger than \u201cSome athletes\nsmoke\u201d, \u201cAll athletes smoke\u201d is highly unusual in\nthat people commonly implicate its denial. Since the derivations have\nthe same form whether or not their conclusions are observed to be\ntrue, Lepore & Stone (2015: 143ff) call this the\n\u201csymmetry\u201d\n problem.[42]\n The Gricean derivation seems plausible only because we knew\nantecedently that the conclusion is true.\n\nAn irony underscoring the ex post facto character of the\nGricean calculation is that Grice himself derived an\nignorance implicature from the maxim of Quantity.\n\n\nA is planning with B an itinerary for a holiday in France. Both know\nthat A wants to see his friend C, if to do so would not involve too\ngreat a prolongation of his journey:\n\nA: Where does C live?\n\nB: Somewhere in the South of France.\n\n(Gloss: There is no reason to suppose that B is opting out; his answer\nis, as he well knows, less informative than is required to meet\nA\u2019s needs. This infringement of the first maxim of Quantity can\nbe explained only by the supposition that B is aware that to be more\ninformative would be to say something that infringed the second maxim\nof Quality. \u201cDon\u2019t say what you lack adequate evidence\nfor\u201d, so B implicates that he does not know in which town C\nlives.) (Grice 1975: 32\u201333; example number\n deleted)[43]\n\n\nIt is plausible that B would have implicated this. But if\nGrice\u2019s reasoning is valid, why shouldn\u2019t Huang conclude\nthat speakers uttering \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d implicate\nthey do not know whether all athletes smoke (an ignorance\nimplicature)?  If Huang\u2019s reasoning is valid, why\nshouldn\u2019t Grice conclude that B implicated C does not live\nin the southernmost part of France (a scalar implicature)? \n\nAccounting for the differences in implicature described in this\nsection is an outstanding problem for pragmatic theory.\n",
