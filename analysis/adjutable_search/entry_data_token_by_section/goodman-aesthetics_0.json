    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nGoodman\u2019s personal life (August 7, 1906\u2013November 25, 1998)\nwas linked to art in many and important ways. From 1929 to 1941, he\ndirected an art gallery in Boston: the Walker-Goodman Art Gallery. It\nis through this commitment that he met his wife, Katharine Sturgis, a\nskilled painter whose work is reproduced in Goodman\u2019s Ways\nof Worldmaking (1978a). In 1941, he received a Ph.D. in\nPhilosophy at Harvard University, with a dissertation, A Study of\nQualities (1941), that laid out the nominalist view that would\nlater be presented in his first book, The Structure of\nAppearance (1951). He taught at Tufts University (1945\u201346),\nThe University of Pennsylvania (1946\u201364), Brandeis University\n(1964\u201367), and, from 1967, at Harvard University, where he\nbecame Emeritus Professor in 1977.\n\nThroughout his life, he remained a passionate collector of ancient and\ncontemporary art pieces, as well as a generous lender and donor to a\nnumber of museums. He was a rigorous philosopher who, however, never\nlacked the capacity to talk to artists and researchers in other\nfields. In 1967, at the School of Education of Harvard, he established\nan interdisciplinary program for the study of education and the arts,\n\u201cProject Zero,\u201d which he directed until 1971. Still at\nHarvard, he founded and directed the Summer Dance program. It is,\nthen, not at all surprising that, amongst Goodman\u2019s works, we\nfind, next to philosophical production, multimedia projects that\ncombine\u2014indeed very much in Goodmanian fashion\u2014painting\n(including Sturgis\u2019s work), music, and dance: Hockey\nSeen (1972), Rabbit Run (1973), and Variations\n(1985d).\n",
