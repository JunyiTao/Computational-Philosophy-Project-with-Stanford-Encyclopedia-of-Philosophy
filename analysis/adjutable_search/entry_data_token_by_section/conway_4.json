    "main_text": "Perfectibility\n4. Perfectibility\n\nA key feature of Conway\u2019s system is perfectibility. All created\nbeings have the potential to increase in perfection. Perfectibility is\ngrounded in divine goodness, and made possible by the mutability of\ncreated things. Holding to the Platonic conception of goodness as\ngodlikeness, Conway argues that since all creatures have some\nresemblance to God, all creatures are endowed with a capacity for\ngood, and an impulse to strive for greater good (\u201ccontinual\nmotion or operation, which most certainly strives for their further\ngood\u201d; Principles VI.6). Everything is thus\nperfectible, with the potential to increase in goodness, even beyond\nits original state in its first creation, ad infinitum. But\nnothing can become infinitely good, because then it would become\nGod.\n\nHowever, the mutability of the creatures\u2019 condition means that\nthey may change for the worse. There is no inevitability about this,\nsince moral corruption in creatures results from either a deliberate\nact of will or indifference of will (a failure to pursue the good)\n(Lascano 2018). The moral degeneration of the creature is mitigated by\nthe fact that no creature can become so corrupt as to lose its\nGod-given goodness entirely. (A creature utterly lacking in goodness\nwould be so unlike God that it could not exist). The residual goodness\nof the creature holds out the possibility of recovery from its\ndegenerate state. To understand how this comes about, let us recall,\nfirst, that the change in creatures is physical as well as moral, such\nthat as a creature degenerates, it becomes more corporeal\n(\u201chardened\u201d). Furthermore, just as a creature can never\nbecome utterly evil, so it can never be reduced to mere corporeality,\nbecause that would be a lifeless condition, so unlike to God as not to\nexist.\n\nThe second factor in the regenerative process is punishment for sin:\nhere pain has a crucial role. Conway holds that the disequilibrium\nbetween corporeality and spirit, whereby it becomes more corporeal, is\na painful condition. The pain so experienced is punishment for the sin\nwhich brought about it to this condition (in that respect sin is its\nown punishment). But Conway holds, further, that the purpose of\npunishment is not merely retributive; pain has a purgative effect on\nthe degenerate creature, leading to its release from its overly\ncorporeal, inactive condition, and enabling it to reset itself on a\ntrajectory of recovery of its original godlikeness. In this process\nits constitutional composition becomes increasingly refined\n(spirit-like) in tandem with its increase in goodness. The\ntrajectories of degeneration, on the one hand, and amelioration echo\nPlato\u2019s account of immortality of the soul in the Phaedo\n80d\u201384b. In Conway\u2019s version, pain and suffering are\nbeneficial because they have a restorative function, thereby playing a\ncrucial role in sustaining the over-all dynamic towards perfectibility\nin her metaphysical system. In this way Conway vindicates the justice\nof God.  Conway\u2019s system is thus a theodicy, which explains pain\nand suffering as a transient conditions, contributory to the\namelioration and recovery of creatures. The consequences in terms of\nreligious belief are that Conway denies the eternity of hell\npunishment and upholds the doctrine the universal salvation or\napocotastasis.\n",
