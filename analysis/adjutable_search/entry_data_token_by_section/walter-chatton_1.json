    "main_text": "Intellectual World\n2. Intellectual World\n\nThree points should be noted about Chatton\u2019s intellectual\nenvironment. First, the theological context in which Chatton and his\ncontemporary philosopher-theologians operated was religiously framed\nbut not intellectually static or sterile. The central metaphysical\ntenets of the faith were treated as fixed-points, not hypotheses, but\nmediaeval Latin philosophers varied widely in their attitudes, and\nmuch of this variability is easily recognizable to modern people\n\u2013 there are skeptics, realists, nominalists, etc.\n\nA second, connected point concerns the genres of mediaeval\nphilosophical writing. Much of mediaeval philosophy was written in the\nform of commentaries or debates with contemporaries (sometimes\npolemical, sometimes not). There are no mediaeval \u2018research\narticles\u2019 and not many systematic, seemingly spontaneous\nmeditations on philosophical topics by theologians. There was little\nconcern, in short, with doctrinal or topical originality, broadly\nspeaking. Rather, to exposit past masters with clarity and ingenuity,\nto match wits skillfully with one\u2019s contemporaries \u2013 these\nwere the chief activities of the philosopher-theologians. All\nChatton\u2019s written works were commissioned in an academic or\necclesiastical context, hence all are in this way theological, but\nthey contain much which almost any modern person would identify as\nphilosophically interesting and innovative.\n\nThird, it is useful to know that Chatton\u2019s immediate academic\nand intellectual world was small and intense, shaped mostly by figures\nand events at the University of Paris and at Oxford. His primary\nopponents, interlocutors, and sources were Aristotle and Augustine\namong the ancients, but among contemporaries and near-contemporaries\nhe cites Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, William Ockham, Richard\nCampsall, Adam Wodeham, and Peter Auriol. In particular, much of his\nwriting is so shaped by debates against Ockham (some of them conducted\nnot only in writing but almost certainly face-to-face) that his mature\nviews are nearly unintelligible in their details apart from\nOckham\u2019s philosophy, and vice versa. Especially illustrative of\nthis interdependence is Chatton\u2019s anti-Ockhamist ontological\nprinciple, often called his \u2018anti-razor\u2019.\n\n",
