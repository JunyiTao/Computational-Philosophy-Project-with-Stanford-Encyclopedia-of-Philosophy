    "main_text": "\n\nSupererogation is the technical term for the class of actions that go\n\u201cbeyond the call of duty.\u201d Roughly speaking,\nsupererogatory acts are morally good although not (strictly) required.\nAlthough common discourse in most cultures allows for such acts and\noften attaches special value to them, ethical theories have only\nrarely discussed this category of actions directly and systematically.\nA conspicuous exception is the Roman Catholic tradition, which gave\nrise to the concept of supererogation, and the virulent attacks on it\nby Lutherans and Calvinists. Surprisingly, the history of\nsupererogation in non-religious ethical theory is fairly recent,\nstarting only in 1958 with J. O. Urmson\u2019s seminal article,\n\u201cSaints and Heroes.\u201d\n\nThe Latin etymology of \u201csupererogation\u201d is paying out more\nthan is due (super-erogare), and the term first appears in\nthe Latin version of the New Testament in the parable of the Good\nSamaritan. Although we often believe that Good Samaritanism is\npraiseworthy and non-obligatory at the same time, philosophical\nreflection raises the question whether there can be any morally good\nactions that are not morally required, and even if there are such\nactions, how come they are optional or supererogatory. Thus, the\nsubstantial literature on supererogation since the 1960s demonstrates\nthat even though the class of actions beyond duty is relatively small\nand the philosophical attention paid to it is only recent, the status\nof supererogation in ethical theory is important in exposing deep\nproblems about the nature of duty and its limits, the relationship\nbetween duty and value, the role of ideals and excuses in ethical\njudgment, the nature of moral reasons, and the connection between\nactions and virtue. Supererogation raises interesting problems both on\nthe meta-ethical level of deontic logic and on the normative level of\nthe justification of moral demands.\n",
