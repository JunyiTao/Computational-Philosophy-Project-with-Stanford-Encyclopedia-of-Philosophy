    "main_text": "Counterfactuals\n3. Counterfactuals\n\nDavid Lewis\u2019s second book was Counterfactuals (1973a).\nCounterfactual conditionals were important to Lewis for several\nreasons. Most obviously, they are a distinctive part of natural\nlanguage and it is philosophically interesting to figure out how they\nwork. But counterfactuals would play a large role in Lewis\u2019s\nmetaphysics. Many of Lewis\u2019s attempted reductions of nomic or\nmental concepts would be either directly in terms of counterfactuals,\nor in terms of concepts (such as causation) that he in turn defined in\nterms of counterfactuals. And the analysis of counterfactuals, which\nuses possible worlds, would in turn provide motivation for believing\nin possible worlds. We will look at these two metaphysical motivations\nin more detail in section 4, where we discuss the relationship between\ncounterfactuals and laws, causation and other high-level concepts, and\nin section 5, where we discuss the motivations for Lewis\u2019s modal\nmetaphysics.\n",
