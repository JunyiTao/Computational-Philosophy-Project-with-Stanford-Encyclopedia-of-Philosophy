    "main_text": "The orthodox view\n2. The orthodox view\n\n\nOn the orthodox view (reflected in Hart 1994, and developed in its strongest form in Raz 1994), questions about the existence and content of legal rights and obligations are questions purely of institutional history. Legal rights and obligations are creatures of institutional action. Institutions that count as authoritative in a legal system create, modify, or extinguish a legal right or obligation primarily through communication (see e.g. Hart 1994 at 124). Institutional communication has its own logic. When an institution passes a statute or adopts a regulation, it must be understood to be conveying a norm (a standard that mandates or permits some action) or, more precisely, to be conveying the institution\u2019s intention to create, by the act of conveying the intention, a norm with the stipulated content. From the perspective of the institution, such an act of communication always has the force of a binding order that subjects are meant to obey and brings into existence a binding norm, namely that subjects ought to take the stipulated action. The norms produced by institutional communication so understood (and possibly also the norms that institutions consider and tacitly endorse in their customary practices) are valid norms of the system and make up the entire content of the law. A legal right or obligation exists when and in virtue of the fact that a norm that is part of the law so understood confers or imposes it, therefore ultimately in virtue of the fact that some institution said so. On the orthodox view, it is a basic, conceptual truth about law that institutional action determines legal rights and obligations in this way.\n\n\nThese considerations describe the mechanism through which\nauthoritative institutional action constitutes rights and obligations. Further\nquestions arise. What makes for authoritativeness in the relevant\nsense (which institutions count as authoritative in the system)? How\nis legal validity related to moral force?\n\n\nThe question which institutions count as authoritative in the system is to be settled in the first instance by other norms constituted by authoritative directive that count as more fundamental. But this kind of explanation can only go so far. To avoid regress, the question must be settled ultimately by some factor other than an authoritatively created norm. A prominent suggestion is that the factor that ultimately explains legal authority is the settled official practice of recognition of the action of certain agents or institutions as a source of norms (a practice that may be considered itself as constituting a customary norm that is tacitly endorsed in and regulates official practice and from which legal institutions ultimately derive their authority to create valid norms; Hart 1994).\n\n\nOn the other hand, the considerations in discussion settle the\nlegal relevance of institutional decisions: the decisions\nmatter to the law as institutionally valid norms that impose\nobligations, which are genuine moral obligations from the point of\nview of the system (Raz 1990; contra Hart 1982). They settle,\nat the same time, the terms in which the further question of\nthe decisions\u2019 genuine normative relevance must be posed. This becomes\nthe question whether institutional communications work as advertised, such that they\ntruly create norms (norms that are valid outright, not merely\nin the eyes of the institution that produced them) and therefore whether subjects do acquire an\nobligation to take some action because the relevant institution said\nso. In sum, the question of the genuine normative relevance of\ninstitutional action becomes the question of whether the institutions\nhave legitimate authority so understood (Raz 1990). Finally, these considerations leave open the question of what moral conditions must be met for the institutions to have legitimate authority. This is the business of theories of justification of authority, which include theories that appeal to consent, political association, democracy, or the ability of legal authority to secure cooperation or help subjects\nbetter conform to right reason. (For an overview,\nsee the entry on authority; see further Finnis\n1980, 1989; Raz 1986; Dworkin 1986. Notice that on Dworkin\u2019s view\npolitical obligation is grounded in political association. Association\ngenerates obligations that associates owe one another, rather than an\nobligation to obey authoritative directives.)\n\n\nSome writers defend a less austere version of this model, by weakening\nthe notion of legal validity. They say that the validity of a\nnorm needn\u2019t depend solely on whether an\ninstitution has conveyed the norm but may further depend on certain moral conditions, provided such conditions are laid down by more fundamental institutionally created norms. For example, if the Constitution entrenches some values, the conditions of validity of norms created by ordinary legislation would include those values. In such a case, the values\nwould play the crucial role only because some institution\u2014a\nconstitutional assembly\u2014said so. In another variant, values may\nbe made relevant to legal validity by the customary norm that governs\njudicial practice, which is the most fundamental norm, constitutive of\na legal system. In that\ncase, the nonnormative social fact of custom that constitutes the\nfundamental norm would make the values relevant to the validity of\nordinary norms (Coleman 2001a). In all these cases, rights and\nobligations in law are explained ultimately by nonnormative social\nfacts, but moral facts occupy some place further up in the order of\nexplanation.\n",
