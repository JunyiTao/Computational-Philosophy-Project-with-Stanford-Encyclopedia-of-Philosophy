    "main_text": "Davidson on the Possibility of Weakness of Will\n2. Davidson on the Possibility of Weakness of Will\n\n\nThis is just what Donald Davidson set out to do in a rich, elegant, \nand incisive paper published in 1970 which has had a towering \ninfluence on the subsequent literature. Davidson\u2019s treatment aims to \nvindicate the possibility of weakness of will; to offer a novel \nanalysis of its nature; to clarify its status as a marginal, somehow \ndefective instance of agency which we rightly find dubiously \nintelligible; and to do all this within the contours of a general \nview of practical reasoning and intentional action which assigns a \ncentral and special role to our evaluative judgments. Let us see how \nhe proposes to do these things.\n\n\nFirst, Davidson offers the following general characterization of \nweak-willed or incontinent \n action:[5]\n\n\n  In doing b an agent acts incontinently if and only\n  if: (a) the agent does b intentionally;\n  (b) the agent believes there is an alternative action\n  a open to him; and (c) the agent judges that, all things\n  considered, it would be better to do a than to do\n  b.\n\n\n\nWe initially described weak-willed action as free, intentional action\ncontrary to the agent\u2019s better judgment; it may be useful to see how\nDavidson\u2019s more precise definition matches up with that initial\ncharacterization. Davidson\u2019s condition (a) requires that the action in\nquestion be intentional.[6] Condition (b) seems intended to ensure that\nthe action in question is\n\n free.[7]\n Part (c) of Davidson\u2019s definition represents what we have called the \nagent\u2019s \u201cbetter judgment,\u201d that is, the overall \nevaluation of his options contrary to which the incontinent agent \nacts.\n\n\nDavidson notes that \u201cthere is no proving such actions exist; \nbut it seems to me absolutely certain that they do\u201d \n(p. 29). Why, then, is there a persistent tendency, both in \nphilosophy and in ordinary thought, to deny that such actions are \npossible? Davidson\u2019s diagnosis is that two plausible principles which\n\u201cderive their force from a very persuasive view of the nature \nof intentional action and practical reasoning\u201d (p. 31) \nappear to entail that incontinence is impossible. He articulates \nthose two principles as follows (p. 23):\n\nP1. If an agent wants to do a more than he wants to\n  do b and he believes himself free to do either a\n  or b, then he will intentionally do a if he does\n  either a or b intentionally.\n\nP2. If an agent judges that it would be better to do\n  a than to do b, then he wants to do a\n  more than he wants to do b.\n\n\n\nP2, Davidson observes, \u201cconnects judgements of what it is \nbetter to do with motivation or wanting\u201d (p. 23); he adds \nlater that it \u201cstates a mild form of internalism\u201d \n(p. 26). Davidson is proposing, contra the extreme \nexternalist position, that our evaluative judgments about the merits \nof the options we deem open to us are not motivationally inert. While\nhe admits that one could quibble or tinker with the formulation of P1\nand P2 (pp. 23\u20134; p. 27; p. 31), he is confident\nthat they or something like them give expression to a powerfully \nattractive picture of practical reasoning and intentional action, one\nwhich assigns an important motivational role to the agent\u2019s \nevaluative \n judgments.[8]\n\n\n\nThe difficulty is, though, that P1 and P2\u2014however \nattractive\u2014together imply that an agent never intentionally \ndoes b when he judges that it would be better to do \na (if he takes himself to be free to do either). And this \ncertainly looks like a denial of the possibility of incontinent \naction. No wonder, then, that so many have been tempted to say that \nakratic action is impossible! Looking carefully, however, we can see \nthat P1 and P2 do not imply the impossibility of incontinent\nactions as Davidson has defined them. For Davidson \ncharacterizes the agent who incontinently does b as holding,\nnot that it would be better to do a than to do b, \nbut that it would be better, all things considered, to do \na than to do b. Is the \u201call things \nconsidered\u201d just a rhetorical flourish? Or does it mark a \ngenuine difference between these two judgments? If these are two \ndifferent judgments, and one can hold the latter without holding the \nformer, then incontinent action is possible even if P1 and P2 are\ntrue.\n\n\nIn the rest of his paper Davidson sets out to vindicate that very \npossibility. The phrase \u201call things considered\u201d is not, \nas it might seem, merely a minor difference in wording that allows \nweakness of will to get off on a technicality. Rather, that phrase \nmarks an important contrast in logical form to which we would need to\nattend in any case in order properly to understand the structure of \npractical reasoning. For that phrase indicates a judgment that is \nconditional or relational rather than \nall-out or unconditional in form; and that \ndifference is \n crucial.[9]\n We can better see the relational character of an \nall-things-considered judgment if we first look at evaluative \njudgments that play an important role in an earlier phase of \npractical reasoning, the phase where we consider what reasons or \nconsiderations favor doing a and what reasons or \nconsiderations favor doing b. (For simplicity, imagine a \ncase in which an agent is choosing between only two mutually \nincompatible options, a and b.) These  prima\nfacie judgments, as Davidson terms them, take the form:\n\nPF: In light of r, a is prima\n  facie better than b.\n\n\n\nIn this schema r refers to a consideration, say that \na would be relaxing, while b would be stressful. A \nPF judgment of this kind thus identifies one respect in which \na is deemed superior to b, one perspective from \nwhich a comes out on top.\n\n\nWe should pause to note three things about PF judgments. (a) A PF \njudgment is not itself a conclusion in favor of the overall \nsuperiority of a. Such \u201call-out\u201d evaluative \njudgments have a simpler logical form, namely:\n\nAO: a is better than b.\n\n\n\n(b) Indeed, no conclusion of the form AO follows logically from any \nPF judgment. (c) More strongly: the fact, taken by itself, that \nsomeone has made a certain PF judgment does not even supply her with \nsufficient grounds to draw the corresponding AO conclusion. For even \nif she makes one PF judgment which favors a over b,\nas in the case we imagined, she may also make other\nPF judgments which favor b over a (say, when \nr is the consideration that b would be lucrative, \nwhile a would be expensive). We do not want to say in that \ncase that she has sufficient grounds to draw each of two incompatible\nconclusions (that a is better than b, and that \nb is better than a; these are incompatible provided\nthe better-than relation is asymmetric, assumed here).\n\n\nWe have contrasted PF judgments with AO or \u201call-out\u201d \nevaluative judgments. PF judgments are relational in character: they \npoint out a relation which holds between the consideration \nr and doing a. (We could call that relation the \n\u201cfavoring\u201d relation.) That relation is not such as to \npermit us to \u201cdetach\u201d (as Davidson puts it, p. 37) \nan unconditional evaluative conclusion in favor of doing a \nfrom PF and the supposition that r obtains. That is, we are \nnot to understand PF judgments as having the form of a material \nconditional.\n\n\nDavidson\u2019s innovative suggestion is that judgments with this PF \nlogical form are an appropriate way to model what happens in the \nearly stages of practical reasoning, where we rehearse reasons for \nand against the options we are considering. And his stressing that no\nsuch PF judgment commits the agent to an overall evaluative \nconclusion in favor of a or b is useful in thinking\nabout a case like Julie\u2019s ((1) above). We described Julie as knowing \n(and therefore believing) that b was more expensive than \na, but opting for b nonetheless. We can imagine, \nthen, that among the ingredients of Julie\u2019s practical reasoning was a\nPF judgment like this:\n\n  In light of the fact that b is more expensive than a,\n  a is prima facie better than b.\n\n\n\nBut this PF judgment alone, as we have seen, does not commit her to \nthe overall judgment that a is better than b. For \nshe may also have made other PF judgments, such as\n\n  In light of the fact that b would be much more\n  gastronomically exciting than a, b is prima\n    facie better than a.\n\n\n\nBut we would not then want to say Julie has sufficient grounds to \nconclude that a is better than b and to conclude \nthat b is better than a. She does not have \nsufficient grounds to embrace a contradiction; her premises all seem \nconsistent. So her various PF judgments, when considered separately, \nmust not each commit her to a corresponding overall \nconclusion in favor of a or b.\n\n\nPractical reasoning, Davidson suggests, starts from judgments like \nthese, each identifying one respect in which one of the options is \nsuperior. But in order to make progress in our practical reasoning we\nshall eventually need to consider how a compares to \nb not just with respect to one consideration, but \nin the light of several considerations taken together. That is, Julie\nwill eventually need to consider how to fill in the blanks in a PF \njudgment like this:\n\n  In light of the fact that b is more expensive\n  than a and the fact that b would be much\n  more gastronomically exciting than a, \u2026 is prima\n  facie better than \u2026.\n\n\n\nThis PF judgment is more comprehensive than the ones we \nattributed to Julie a moment ago, as it takes into account a broader \nrange of considerations. (I take the label \n\u201ccomprehensive\u201d from Lazar 1999.) Now in Julie\u2019s case we \ncan surmise how she filled in those blanks: with \u201cb is\nprima facie better than a.\u201d Julie\u2019s filling \nin the blanks in that way can naturally be taken as expressing the \nview that the much greater gastronomic excitement promised by \nb outweighs or overrides b\u2019s \ninferiority to a from a strictly financial standpoint.\n\n\nWe can generalize our schema for PF judgments to account for the \npossibility of relativizing our comparative assessment of a \nand b not just to a single consideration, but to multiple \nconsiderations taken together or as a body:\n\nPFN: In light of \u27e8r1, \u2026,\n  rn\u27e9, a is prima facie\n  better than b.\n\n\n\nNotice that PFN judgments are still relational in form: they assert \nthat a relation (the \u201cfavoring\u201d relation) holds between \nthe set of considerations \u27e8r1, \n\u2026, rn\u27e9 and doing a. Indeed, \nthe relational character of a PFN judgment remains even if we make it\nas comprehensive as we can: if we expand the set \n\u27e8r1, \u2026, rn\u27e9\nto incorporate all the considerations the agent deems \nrelevant to her decision. Following Davidson (p. 38), let us \ngive the label e to that set. So even the following \njudgment:\n\nATC: In light of e, a is prima\n  facie better than b.\n\n\n\nis a relational or conditional judgment and not an all-out conclusion\nin favor of doing a. To make a judgment of the form ATC is \nnot to draw an overall conclusion in favor of doing \na.\n\n\nWe may be better able to see this by considering an analogy from \ntheoretical reason. Suppose Hercule Poirot has been called in to \ninvestigate a murder. We can imagine him assessing bits of evidence \nas he encounters them:\n\nIn light of the fact that the murder weapon belongs to Colonel\n  Mustard, Mustard looks guilty;\nIn light of his having an alibi for the time of the murder, Mustard\n  looks not guilty;\n\n\n\nand so on. These are theoretical analogues of the PF judgments \nrelativized to single considerations which we looked at earlier. \nHowever, Poirot will eventually need to consider how these various \nbits of evidence add up; that is, he will eventually need to fill in \nthe blanks in a more comprehensive PFN judgment like this:\n\n  In light of\n  \u27e8e1, \u2026, en\u27e9,\n  \u2026 looks to be the guilty party,\n\n\n\nwhere \n\u27e8e1, \u2026, en\u27e9\nis a set of bits of pertinent evidence. Notice, though, that no such \nPFN judgment actually constitutes settling on a particular person as \nthe culprit. For even if we put in a maximally large \n\u27e8e1, \u2026, en\u27e9\nconsisting of all the evidence Poirot has seen, and imagine \nhim thinking\n\n  All the evidence I have seen points toward Colonel Mustard as the\n  guilty party,\n\n\n\nto make this observation is manifestly not to conclude that \nMustard is guilty.\n\n\nIn the same way, an ATC or all-things-considered judgment, although\ncomprehensive, is still relational in nature, and therefore distinct\nfrom an AO judgment in favor of a. That is, it is possible to\nmake an ATC judgment in favor of a without making the\ncorresponding AO judgment in favor of a. (This is the\nanalogue of Poirot\u2019s position.)  And this is the key to Davidson\u2019s\nsolution to the problem of how weakness of will is possible. For ATC\nis, precisely, the agent\u2019s better judgment as Davidson\nconstrues it in his definition of incontinent action. P1 and P2\ntogether imply that an agent who reaches an AO conclusion in favor\nof a will not intentionally do b. But the\nincontinent agent never reaches such an AO conclusion. With respect\nto a, he remains stuck at the Hercule Poirot stage: he sees\nthat the considerations he has rehearsed, taken as a body,\nfavor a, but he is unwilling or unable to make a commitment\nto a as the thing to do.[10] He makes only a relational ATC judgment\nin favor of a, contrary to which he then acts.\n\n\nWhat should we say about an agent who does this? Returning to the \nthree features of prima facie or PF judgments which we noted\nearlier, features (a) and (b) hold even of the special \nsubclass of PF judgments which are ATC judgments. Such judgments \nneither are equivalent to, nor logically imply, any AO judgment. So \nthe incontinent agent who fails to draw the AO conclusion which \ncorresponds to his ATC conclusion, and to perform the corresponding \naction, is not committing \u201ca simple logical blunder\u201d \n(p. 40). Notably, he does not contradict himself. He does, \nhowever, exhibit a defect in rationality, on Davidson\u2019s account. For \nfeature (c) of PF judgments in general does not hold of the \nspecial subclass of such judgments which are ATC judgments. Drawing \nan ATC conclusion in favor of a does give \none sufficient grounds to conclude that a is better sans\nphrase and, indeed, to do \na. For Davidson proposes that the transition from an ATC \njudgment in favor of a to the corresponding AO judgment, and\nto doing a, is enjoined by a substantive principle of \nrationality which he dubs \u201cthe principle of continence.\u201d \nThat principle tells us to \u201cperform the action judged best on \nthe basis of all available relevant reasons\u201d (p. 41); and \nthe incontinent agent violates this injunction. The principle of \ncontinence thus substantiates the idea that \u201cwhat is wrong is \nthat the incontinent man acts, and judges, irrationally, for this is \nsurely what we must say of a man who goes against his own best \njudgement\u201d (p. 41). He acts irrationally in virtue of \nviolating this substantive principle, obedience to which is a \nnecessary condition for rationality.\n\n\nWe must put this point about the irrationality of incontinence with \nsome care, however. For recall that an incontinent action must itself\nbe intentional, that is, done for a reason. The weak-willed agent, \nthen, has a reason for doing b, and does b for that\nreason. What he lacks\u2014and lacks by his own lights\u2014is a \nsufficient reason to do b, given all the \nconsiderations that he takes to favor a. As Davidson puts \nit, if we ask \u201cwhat is the agent\u2019s reason for doing \n[b] when he believes it would be better, all things \nconsidered, to do another thing, then the answer must be: for this, \nthe agent has no reason\u201d (p. 42). And this is so even \nthough he does have a reason for doing b (p. 42, \nn. 25). Because the agent has, by his own lights, no adequate \nreason for doing b, he cannot make sense of his own action: \n\u201che recognizes, in his own intentional behaviour, something \nessentially surd\u201d (p. 42). So akratic action, while \npossible on Davidson\u2019s account, is nonetheless necessarily \nirrational; this is the sense in which it is a defective and\nnot fully intelligible instance of agency, despite being a very real \nphenomenon.\n",
