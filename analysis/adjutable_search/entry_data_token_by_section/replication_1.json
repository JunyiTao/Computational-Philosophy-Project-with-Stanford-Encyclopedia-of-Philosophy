    "main_text": "Genes and Information\n2. Genes and Information\n\nThe language of \u201ccodes\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d\nflows easily enough with respect to replication [see the entry\n biological information].\n Transcription, translation, punctuation, redundancy, synonymy,\nediting, proofreading, errors, repairing of errors, messages, copies,\nand information all sound natural enough. Yet, the literature dealing\nwith information is both extensive and factious. Several different\nformal analyses of information can be found and very little agreement\nabout which analysis is best for which subjects. On one point, these\nscholars tend to agree\u2014cybernetic information and\ncommunication-theoretic information will not do for replication in\nbiological contexts. Some argue for semantic information\n(Godfrey-Smith 2000a; Sarkar 2000; Sterelny 2000b). The trouble is\nthat no widely accepted version of semantic information exists. Winnie\n(2000) distinguishes between Classical and Algorithmic Information\nTheory and opts for a revised version of the Algorithmic Theory. But,\nonce again, the problem is that no such formal analysis currently\nexists.\n\nIn the face of all this disagreement and unfinished business,\nbiologists such as Maynard Smith (2000) maintain either that informal\nanalyses of \u201cinformation\u201d are good enough or that some\nfuture formal version of information theory will justify the sorts of\ninferences that they make. The sense of \u201cinformation\u201d used\nin the Central Dogma of molecular biology is more like a fit of\ntemplate, or the primary structure of the protein sequence compared to\nthe sequence of the DNA base pairs. Attempts have been made in what is\nnow known as bioinformatics to use Classical Information Theory\n(Shannon\u2019s theory of communication) to extract functional and\nphylogenetic information (Brooks & Wiley 1988; Gatlin 1972;\nMaclaurin 1998; Rodrick Wallace & Wallace 1998), but they appear\nto have been unsuccessful in the main.\n\nWhile the most likely conclusion is that no version of information\ntheory as currently formulated can handle \u201cinformation\u201d as\nit functions in biology (Griffiths 2001), attempts have continued to\nbe made to formulate just such a version (Bergstrom & Rosvall\n2011; Sternberg 2008). However, this undercuts the motivation for\nappealing to information theory to elucidate genes in the first\ninstance. Griffiths & Stotz (2013: 153) have argued for\n\u201cCrick\u201d information, which they define as \u201cthe\nspecification of the order of amino acids in a polypeptide\nchain\u201d. This specificity definition is more chemical than\nabstract [see the section below on\n Developmental Systems Theory].\n\nThe \u201cinformational gene\u201d conception, as James R. Griesemer\n(2005) terms it, is a highly abstract concept of a process and the\nentities that comprise it. This is intentional, as it permits\nDarwinian dynamics to be applied to a range of phenomena, such as\nsociocultural, cybernetic, and medical processes. However, this raises\na metaphysical concern, namely that the view that a gene is nothing\nbut information is a version of Aristotelian hylomorphism [see the\nentry\n form versus matter].\n That is, information is a type of form, which can be used to explain\nphysical processes. Classical hylomorphism was roundly demolished as a\nscientific hypothesis when Daltonian elements were named and\ninvestigated in the nineteenth century. By 1900, terms like\n\u201csubstance\u201d (for matter that is propertyless apart from\nmass and extension in space) and \u201cform\u201d had taken on a\nlargely philosophical sense that differed extensively from\nAristotle\u2019s own physical views. Griesemer notes:\n\n\nWe know that the informational genes are tied to matter and structure,\nbut if evolutionary theory \u2013 to be general enough to cover\ncultural and conceptual change \u2013 must be devoid of all reference\nto concrete mechanism, it cannot follow from the theory, for example,\nthat genes are inside organisms or are even parts of organisms, as\nDawkins\u2019s language suggests. Strictly, only the correlations\nbetween replicator and vehicle due to causal connections of a\ncompletely unspecified sort can be implied by such a theory. Striving\nto get matter and specific structure out of the theory in order to\nmake it apply to immaterial realms may thus leave it bankrupt as an\naccount of causal connection for the material, biological cases.\n(2005: 79)\n\n\nAnd yet, this kind of hylomorphism has remained, even in science.\nBiologists have argued that form determined many properties of\norganisms in ways that could not be reduced to the actions of their\nparts, and this kind of thinking remained and was co-opted by the\nmolecular biologists and geneticists. Thus, we get the Central Dogma\nof molecular biology:\n\n\nThe Central Dogma\n\nThis states that once \u2018information\u2019 has passed into\nprotein it cannot get out again. In more detail, the transfer\nof information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from nucleic acid\nto protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or\nfrom protein to nucleic acid is impossible. Information means here the\nprecise determination of sequence, either of bases in the\nnucleic acid or of amino acid residues in the protein. (Crick\n1958)\n\n\nRead physically, this means only that the structure of the DNA\nmolecule is not reproduced from the structure of proteins, a perfectly\nreasonable account of the molecular processes. However, because Crick\nused the word \u201cinformation\u201d, some scientists, including\nDawkins, took this to mean that genes are informational entities,\nwhich \u201ccode\u201d for organismic traits from the molecular\nlevel up to the entire organism and even beyond. This is striking in a\npurple passage of The Blind Watchmaker, where Dawkins\ndescribes genes as follows:\n\n\nIt is raining DNA outside. [downy seeds from willow trees] \u2026\nThe cotton wool is mostly made of cellulose, and it dwarfs the tiny\ncapsule that contains the DNA, the genetic information. The DNA\ncontent must be a small proportion of the total, so why did I say that\nit was raining DNA rather than cellulose? The answer is that it is the\nDNA that matters\u2026 whose coded characters spell out specific\ninstructions for building willow trees\u2026 It is raining\ninstructions out there, it\u2019s raining programs; it\u2019s\nraining tree-growing, fluff spreading, algorithms. That is not a\nmetaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn\u2019t be any plainer if\nit were raining floppy disks. (1986: 111)\n\n\nSo, we now turn to Dawkins\u2019 view of genes as\nreplicators and the way in which he takes information to be\ncybernetic and physical at the same time.\n",
