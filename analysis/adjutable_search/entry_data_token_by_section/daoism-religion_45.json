    "main_text": "The External and the Internal Elixirs || Alchemy and Cosmology\n10.3 Neidan or Internal Alchemy\n\nAlthough the Cantong qi forever changed the history of Daoist\nalchemy, by no means are all Waidan works written in the Tang period\n(7th-9th centuries) inspired by its doctrines\n(Sivin 1968; Needham 1976: 132\u201374). During this period, however,\nWaidan methods increasingly tend to mirror features of the\ncosmological system (Sivin 1976 and 1980).\n\nThe shift of focus from ritual to cosmology also paved the way for the\ndevelopment of Neidan. However, the roots of Neidan are multiple, and\nit would be reductive to see it as a mere transposition of Waidan to\nan \u201cinner\u201d plane: Neidan owes its origins to meditation\nmethods on the inner gods more than it does to Waidan (Pregadio 2005).\nTo summarize a complex phenomenon, Waidan terminology and imagery were\ncombined with concepts and emblems drawn from the cosmological system\naccording to the model of the Cantong qi, and with elements\ninherited from the early meditation practices. This necessarily caused\nthe disappearance of the inner gods themselves: incorporating them\ninto Neidan would require an impossible \u201cre-mapping\u201d of\nthe inner pantheon onto a different cosmological model. The only, but\nmajor, exception is the Red Child, the innermost deity of early Daoist\nmeditation (see\n \u00a79.1).\n When he reappears in Neidan, however, the Red Child is no longer a\ngod possessed by all human beings: he is now an image of the\n\u201cembryo\u201d generated by means of the alchemical\npractice.\n\nEspecially in its forms that integrate elements defined (or\nre-defined) by Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism, Neidan focuses its\ndiscourse and practice on xing and ming, two\ncardinal concepts in its view of the human being (Robinet 1995:\n165\u201395; Pregadio 2014). Xing denotes the \u201cinner\nnature\u201d, which is related to Spirit (shen) and pertains\nto one\u2019s \u201cheart\u201d or \u201cmind\u201d\n(xin). Neidan texts often discourse on xing by using\nBuddhist terms and expressions, such as \u201cseeing one\u2019s\nnature\u201d (jianxing), and even use the term \u201cBuddha-nature\u201d (foxing). Ming, an even more complex\nterm, is related to Breath (qi) and pertains to the\n\u201cbody\u201d (shen). The term means in the first place\nthe \u201ccommand\u201d or \u201cmandate\u201d conferred by\nHeaven, but its senses also include \u201clife\u201d,\n\u201cexistence\u201d, \u201clifespan\u201d, as well as\n\u201cdestiny\u201d. While one\u2019s xing is unborn and\nis therefore free from death, everything in the domain of\nming has a beginning and an end.\n\nAs far as we know, Neidan developed from the early 8th\ncentury onwards. Two of its main branches, which emerged between the\n12th and the 13th centuries, are traditionally\nascribed with the creation of models of self-cultivation based on the\nconcepts summarized above (Yokote 2015). The first model, associated\nwith the Nanzong (Southern Lineage), gives initial priority\nto the cultivation of one\u2019s ming (existence), gradually\nshifting to the cultivation of xing (inner nature) as the\npractice progresses. The second model, associated with the\nBeizong (Northern Lineage), emphasizes instead the\ncultivation of one\u2019s xing by means of \u201cclarity\nand quiescence\u201d (qingjing); this is also said to\ninvolve the cultivation of one\u2019s ming. Despite the\ndifferences between these two models, Neidan as a whole insists that\nboth xing and ming should be cultivated, a view\nreflected in the term \u201cconjoined cultivation of nature and\nexistence\u201d (xingming shuangxiu).\n\nIn its most widespread codification, which originates in the Southern\nLineage, the Neidan practice consists of three main stages (Despeux\n1979: 55\u201382; Robinet 1995: 147\u201364; Wang Mu 2011). Its\npurpose is to lead an adept from the postcelestial to the precelestial\ndomains through the gradual reintegration of each of the three main\ncomponents of the human being\u2014Essence, Breath, and\nSpirit\u2014into the one that precedes it, culminating in the\nreversion to the state of Non-Being (wu), or Emptiness\n(xu, kong). While this is the function of alchemy\nper se, certain authors indicate that the process of\nascent to the precelestial domain should be followed by\na new descent or return to the postcelestial domain, in\norder to merge them with one another.\n\nThe practice outlined above is often described as the generation of\n\u201ca person outside one\u2019s person\u201d (or \u201ca self\noutside oneself\u201d, shen zhi wai shen), defined as the\n\u201ctrue person\u201d (zhenshen; compare\n \u00a76.3).\n In this case, the main stages of the practice are portrayed as the\nconception, gestation, and birth of an embryo, which personifies the\npractitioner\u2019s realized state (Despeux 2016). In another view,\nthe Internal Elixir is seen as already possessed by every human being\nand as identical to one\u2019s own innate realized state. Liu Yiming\n(1734\u20131821) expresses this view by saying: \u201cAll human\nbeings have this Golden Elixir complete in themselves: it is entirely\nrealized in everybody\u201d. Other authors of Neidan texts state in\ntheir works that \u201cthe Golden Elixir is in front of your\neyes\u201d.\n",
