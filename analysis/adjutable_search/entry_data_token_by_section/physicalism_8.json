    "main_text": "The Completeness Question || Fundamentality Physicalism\n2.5 Fundamentality Physicalism\n\nThe final answer to the completeness question we will consider focuses\non the idea of a fundamental property, which is a notion discussed\nextensively in David Lewis\u2019s metaphysics, and the literature\nthat follows on from it. On Lewis\u2019s view, a fundamental or\nperfectly natural property is a special kind of property, one that is,\nas he says, \u201cnot at all disjunctive, or determinable, or\nnegative. They render their instances perfectly similar in some\nrespect. They are intrinsic; and all other intrinsic properties\nsupervene on them\u201d (2009, 204). This suggests the following\nformulation of physicalism:\n\n(8)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff every\nfundamental property instantiated at w is a physical\nproperty.\n\n\nSuppose we call physicalism so defined fundamentality\nphysicalism; what is the relation between it and supervenience\nphysicalism? Supervenience physicalism does not entail fundamentality\nphysicalism, since the fact that a property F supervenes on a\nproperty G does not entail that either property is\nfundamental. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to think that\nfundamentality physicalism entails supervenience physicalism,\nespecially in the light of Lewis\u2019s comment about supervenience\njust quoted.\n\nHow plausible is (8) as an account of physicalism? One objection\nconcerns the notion of a fundamental property quite generally. For at\nleast some philosophers, Lewis\u2019s ideas about fundamentality are, as he\nhimself puts it, a throwback to medieval metaphysics (Lewis 1983).\nAnother objection is that physicalism on this view seems empirically\nspeculative, since it seems to entail that there is a fundamental\nlevel in the world; if so, definitions in terms of grounding may do\nbetter (Schaffer 2003). Whatever is the truth about these objections,\nit is an interesting historical fact that Lewis defines physicalism\ntwice-over. He defines it as supervenience physicalism (as we saw\nabove) and also as fundamentality physicalism. There is no suggestion\nin his work that these are in any sense in tension (for further\ndiscussion, see Stoljar 2015). This underscores the point made\nearlier, namely, that in practice all versions of physicalism, and\nhence any answer to the completeness question, will include modal and\nnon-modal elements. \n",
