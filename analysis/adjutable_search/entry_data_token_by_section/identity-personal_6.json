    "main_text": "Animalism and Brute-Physical Views\n7. Animalism and Brute-Physical Views\n\nAnimalism says that we human people are organisms. This does not imply\nthat all organisms, or even all human organisms, are people: as we saw\nearlier, human embryos and animals in a vegetative state are not\npeople on the most common definitions of that term. Being a person may\nbe only a temporary property of us, like being a student. Nor does it\nimply that all people are organisms: it is consistent with there being\nwholly inorganic people such as gods or intelligent robots. Animalism\nis not an answer to the personhood question. (It is consistent, for\ninstance, with Locke\u2019s definition of \u2018person\u2019.)\n\nThe dominant view among both animalists and their opponents is that\norganisms persist by virtue of some sort of brute-physical continuity\nwith no psychological element. So most animalists accept a\nbrute-physical account of our persistence. And most advocates of\nbrute-physical views take us to be organisms. This suggests that we\nhave the same persistence conditions as certain nonpeople, such as\noysters. And our persistence conditions differ from those of\nimmaterial people, if there could be such things, so that there are no\npersistence conditions for people as such. Though some object to this\n(Baker 2000: 124), many psychological-continuity theorists say that\nall beings with mental properties have the same persistence conditions\n(Shoemaker 2008, Unger 2000), which has the same implication.\n\nThe most common objection to brute-physical views (and, by extension,\nto animalism) focuses on their implication that transplanting your\nbrain into my head would not give you a new body, but would give me a\nnew brain. You would stay behind with an empty head (e.g. Unger 2000;\nfor an important related objection see Johnston 2007, 2016).\nAnimalists generally concede that this is counterintuitive, but take\nthis fact to be outweighed by other considerations: that we appear to\nbe organisms, for example, that it\u2019s hard to say what sort of\nnonorganisms we might be, and that our being organisms would\navoid the too-many-thinkers problem. And animalism is compatible with\nour beliefs about who is who in real life: every actual case in which\nwe take someone to survive or perish is a case where a human organism\ndoes so. Psychological-continuity views, by contrast, conflict with\nthe appearance that each of us was once a foetus. When we see an\nultrasound picture of a 12-week-old foetus, we ordinarily think\nwe\u2019re seeing something that will, if all goes well, be born,\nlearn to speak, and eventually become an adult human person, yet no\nperson is in any way psychologically continuous with a 12-week-old\nfoetus.\n\nAnd the \u201ctransplant objection\u201d may be less compelling than\nit first appears (Snowdon 2014: 234). Suppose you had a tumor that\nwould kill you unless your brain were replaced with a healthy donated\norgan. This would have grave side-effects: it would destroy your\nmemories, plans, preferences, and other mental properties. It may not\nbe clear whether you could survive it, even if the operation were\nsuccessful. But is it really obvious that you could not\nsurvive it? Maybe it could save your life, though at great cost. And\nthis might be so, the argument goes, even if the new brain gave you\nmemories, plans, and preferences from the donor. But if it\u2019s not\nobvious that the brain recipient would not be you, then it\u2019s not\nobvious that it would be the donor. A brain transplant might be\nmetaphysically analogous to a liver transplant. Again, the claim is\nnot that this is obviously true, but only that it\u2019s not\nobviously false. And in that case it\u2019s not obvious that a person\nmust go with her transplanted brain. (Williams 1970 argues in a\nsimilar way.)\n",
