    "main_text": "\n\nThe distinction between essential versus accidental\nproperties has been characterized in various ways, but it is\noften understood in modal terms: an essential\nproperty of an object is a property that it must have, while an\naccidental property of an object is one that it happens to\nhave but that it could lack. Let\u2019s call this the basic modal\ncharacterization, where a modal characterization of a\nnotion is one that explains the notion in terms of\nnecessity/possibility. In the characterization just given of the\ndistinction between essential and accidental properties, the use of\nthe word \u201cmust\u201d reflects the fact that\nnecessity is invoked, while the use of the word\n\u201ccould\u201d reflects that possibility is\ninvoked. The notions of necessity and possibility are interdefinable:\nto say that something is necessary is to say that its negation is not\npossible; to say that something is possible is to say that its\nnegation is not necessary; to say that an object must have a certain\nproperty is to say that it could not lack it; and to say that an\nobject could have a certain property is to say that it is not the case\nthat it must lack it.\n\nMany would say that each individual human could not fail to be human;\nif so, then the basic modal characterization counts the property of\nbeing human as an essential property of each human. And, too, many\nwould say that although someone, say Socrates, is in fact fond of\ndogs, Socrates could have lacked that property; if that is right, then\nthe basic modal characterization counts the property of being fond of\ndogs as an accidental property of Socrates.\n \nA modal characterization of the distinction between essential and\naccidental properties is taken for granted in nearly all work in\nanalytic metaphysics in the latter half of the 20th century. Advocates\nof the modal characterization have included Ruth Barcan Marcus (1967)\nand Saul Kripke (1972/1980), among others. However, some other\ncharacterizations of the distinction (see \u00a72) have recently\ngained currency. It is worth stressing here at the outset that\nalthough there is now some disagreement about how the distinction\nbetween essential and accidental properties is to be drawn, there is\nnevertheless some agreement about cases. Most would agree that however\nthe distinction is drawn, it should come out that being human (or\nbeing human if existent) is an essential property of Socrates while\nbeing fond of dogs is a merely accidental property of Socrates.\n\nEssentialism in general may be characterized as the doctrine\nthat (at least some) objects have (at least some) essential\nproperties. This characterization is not universally accepted (see\n\u00a73), but no characterization is; and at least this one has the\nvirtue of being simple and straightforward. As for specific\nessentialist claims, we have already encountered one\u2014the claim\nthat the property of being human is essential to Socrates. Another\nexample is the claim that Socrates\u2019s biological\norigin\u2014Socrates\u2019s parents, or more particularly, the sperm\nand egg from which Socrates arose\u2014is essential to Socrates. The\nfirst example is a brand of sortal essentialism while the\nsecond is a brand of origin essentialism. Both of these kinds\nof essentialisms have figured prominently in the philosophical\nliterature.\n",
