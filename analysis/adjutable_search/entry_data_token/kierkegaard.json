Stephen Evans replaces the\n former entry\n on this topic by the previous author.] \n\n\nS\u00f8ren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855) was an astonishingly\nprolific writer whose work\u2014almost all of which was written in\nthe 1840s\u2014is difficult to categorize, spanning philosophy,\ntheology, religious and devotional writing, literary criticism,\npsychology and social critique. Kierkegaard\u2019s mode of\nphilosophizing opposes system-building and owes more in its approach\nto the ancients, particularly his hero Socrates, though his work also\ndraws strongly and creatively on the Bible and other Christian\nsources. The opposition to system-building means that Kierkegaard has\noften been understood as an arch opponent of Hegel, but scholarship in\nrecent decades has challenged and complicated this view, suggesting\nboth that some of Kierkegaard\u2019s central ideas are creative\ndevelopments of Hegel\u2019s ideas, and that the main target of his\ncritique is certain Danish Hegelians influential in his day, rather\nthan Hegel himself (see especially Stewart 2003 and\n section 4\n below). Also often dubbed the \u201cfather of existentialism\u201d,\nthis label obscures at least as much as it reveals, especially to\nthose who associate existentialism with atheistic figures such as\nSartre. Kierkegaard\u2019s thought has certainly influenced thinkers\nin the phenomenological and existential traditions (including\nHeidegger, Sartre, Jaspers, Marcel, and L\u00e9vinas), but also\nthinkers in very different philosophical traditions, such as\nWittgenstein (who famously described him as a \u201csaint\u201d and\n\u201cby far the most profound thinker\u201d of the nineteenth\ncentury). In addition to influencing philosophers and\ntheologians\u2014inside and outside his own Lutheran\ntradition\u2014Kierkegaard\u2019s thought has also influenced\nvarious novelists and poets (including Henrik Ibsen, Franz Kafka,\nMiguel de Unamuno, August Strindberg, W. H. Auden, Walker Percy, John\nUpdike, Richard Wright, R. S. Thomas, and Haven Kimmel); artists and\nfilmmakers (including Edvard Munch and Carl Theodor Dreyer);\npsychiatrists and psychotherapists (including Ludwig Binswanger, Carl\nRogers, Rollo May, R. D. Laing, and Irvin Yalom). (For articles on\nseveral of these influences in philosophy, theology and literature,\nsee Carlisle 2013, Welz 2013, Shakespeare 2013, Rudd 2013, Lippitt\n2013b, Barrett 2013, Lisi 2013, and Pyper 2013.) One reason why\nKierkegaard has had an impact upon such a diversity of figures is his\nfocus on the question of what it means to be an existing, finite human\nbeing, a concern he associates with \u201cinwardness\u201d, and\nwhich contrasts with what he takes to be the misguided idea that one\ncan understand reality in a disengaged manner and from no particular\npoint of view. He believed that his age had in various ways forgotten\nthis fundamental truth, an enormous failing manifested in both its\nphilosophy and its theology.\n", "toc": [{"#LifeWork": "1.

Life and Works\n\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard was born to Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard and\nAnne (Lund) Kierkegaard in Copenhagen on 5 May 1813, the youngest of\nseven children. He spent most of his life in and around the Danish\ncapital, traveling abroad on only a handful of occasions (mostly to\nBerlin, including to hear Schelling\u2019s lectures).\nKierkegaard\u2019s father, who had been born to a poor family in\nJutland, had become wealthy as a merchant in Copenhagen. Michael was\ndevoutly religious, and young S\u00f8ren was brought up as a\nLutheran but was also shaped by a Moravian congregation in which his\nfather played a prominent role. Kierkegaard was in turn deeply\ninfluenced by his father, about whose \u201cmelancholy\u201d much\nhas been written. One alleged cause of this, much speculated upon,\nconcerns the story that Kierkegaard\u2019s father believed he and his\nfamily to have been living under a curse because of his having cursed\nGod as a cold and hungry child.\n\nAfter a prolonged period of study at the University of Copenhagen,\nS\u00f8ren received a first degree in theology and a\nMagister degree in philosophy, with a dissertation dealing\nwith irony as practiced by Socrates (On the Concept of Irony with\nContinual Reference to Socrates). The Magister degree\nwas the equivalent of a contemporary doctorate, the title being\nchanged to \u201cdoctor\u201d some years later. He then completed\nthe pastoral seminary program that qualified him to become a priest in\nthe Lutheran state church. However, Kierkegaard was never ordained and\nnever became a pastor, though he preached on occasions in various\nCopenhagen churches.\n\nIn 1840 Kierkegaard became engaged to the eighteen-year-old Regine\nOlsen. He quickly came to believe that he had made a terrible mistake\nand that he could not marry her. His reasons are not fully known but\nhave been the subject of a great deal of speculation, much of it bound\nup with Kierkegaard\u2019s own \u201cmelancholy\u201d and\nrelationship to his by then deceased father. In the letter returning\nher ring, Kierkegaard asks Regine to forgive him, the one who\n\u201cwhatever else he was capable of could not make a girl\nhappy\u201d (cited in Hannay 2001: 155). In his journals, he expands\non this, reflecting several years later that within six months of\nmarriage to him she would have \u201cgone to pieces\u201d, as there\nwas \u201csomething spectral about me\u201d, which would make a\n\u201creal relationship\u201d with him impossible (PJ 421\u20132).\nRegine vigorously opposed ending the engagement. After fruitlessly\nseeking to change her mind, S\u00f8ren embarked on a misguided (and\nunsuccessful) scheme to free her from attachment to him by pretending\nto be a scoundrel who had trifled with her affections. Finally, in\n1841 he broke the engagement for good and fled to Berlin for a brief\ntime, perhaps in part to escape the public scandal of the whole\naffair. Kierkegaard remained unmarried for the rest of his life, his\nwill bequeathing to Regine what remained of his worldly goods, to make\nthe point that to him the engagement was just as binding as a\nmarriage. Regine\u2014or rather, her husband on her\nbehalf\u2014declined to accept the bequest, except for a few personal\nitems that Regine wanted.\n\nThe period following the end of the engagement was one of the most\nproductive of Kierkegaard\u2019s authorship. Work on the text that he\nconsidered properly to begin his authorship, Either/Or, began\nalmost as soon as he arrived in Berlin, and it was published in 1843.\nBetween that year and 1846, several other works appeared: Fear and\nTrembling (1843), Repetition (1843), Philosophical\nFragments (1844), The Concept of Anxiety (1844), several\ncollections of Upbuilding Discourses (1843, 1844),\nPrefaces (1844), Three Discourses on Imagined\nOccasions (1845), Stages on Life\u2019s Way (1845),\nConcluding Unscientific Postscript (1846), and A Literary\nReview, better known in English as Two Ages (1846).\n\nIt is clear enough that some of Kierkegaard\u2019s early writings\ncontained disguised communications to Regine, who soon married another\nman (Johan Frederik Schlegel, later Governor-General of the Danish\nWest Indies), which meant that Kierkegaard could not communicate\ndirectly with her. He hoped she might come to realize that he still\nloved her, but also understand why he could not go through with the\nmarriage. Biographies of Kierkegaard often focus on the broken\nengagement in detail, and commentators have sometimes gone to great\nlengths to find \u201cmessages to Regine\u201d in\nKierkegaard\u2019s texts, some more plausible than others. However,\nRegine was far from the only person who could be described as\n\u201cthat individual\u201d to whom Kierkegaard dedicated many of\nhis works.\n\nTwo other biographical episodes are worth mentioning. First, in\n1845\u20136 Kierkegaard became embroiled in a controversy with\nThe Corsair, a satirical literary magazine that included\ncartoons mocking many of Denmark\u2019s most prominent public\nfigures. Initially Kierkegaard was spared this treatment, and indeed\nwas on friendly terms with Meir Goldschmidt, a Jewish intellectual who\nwas the magazine\u2019s editor. However, after Kierkegaard (in the\npersona of one of his pseudonyms) goaded the magazine by attacking P.\nL. M\u00f8ller, an aspiring scholar who wrote for The\nCorsair, Kierkegaard became the object of a series of nasty\nattacks, which included mocking his personal appearance. This might\nseem inconsequential, but all the main figures involved had their\nlives dramatically changed. S\u00f8ren, whose chief recreational\noccupation had been daily walks around Copenhagen, in which he\nconversed with many people, taking what he called \u201cpeople\nbaths\u201d, became reclusive, unable to endure the curious and\nsometimes jeering groups of people who stared at him. As a result, he\ngave up the idea of becoming a pastor, feeling a call to \u201cremain\nat his post\u201d as an author. Following the \u201cCorsair\naffair\u201d, Kierkegaard\u2014who had intended the Concluding\nUnscientific Postscript to bring his authorship to an\nend\u2014embarked upon a second, highly productive period of writing,\nthe fruits of which include Upbuilding Discourses in Various\nSpirits (1847), Works of Love (1847), Christian\nDiscourses (1848), The Sickness Unto Death (1849),\nPractice in Christianity (1850) and several more discourses\n(for the full list, see the Chronology below).\n\nSecond, in the last two years of his life, Kierkegaard, known as a\ndefender of Christian faith, embarked on a controversial attack on the\nDanish state church, a target that symbolized all that he thought was\nwrong with \u201cChristendom\u201d as a whole. The attack on the\nChurch was made in the name of \u201cNew Testament\nChristianity\u201d, which Kierkegaard thought the Church had\nbetrayed. The war was waged in newspapers and in a pamphlet\n(\u00d8jeblikket, variously translated as The\nMoment or The Instant) that Kierkegaard himself founded\nand for which he wrote ten issues. These writings are markedly\ndifferent from the rest of his work. Obviously intended for a broad\naudience, they employed searing wit and satire, making no attempt to\nbe subtle or nuanced. Amid this public battle, Kierkegaard collapsed\non the street, paralyzed, and was taken to hospital. He died there a\nfew weeks later, on 11 November 1855. A tentative diagnosis of the\ncause was tuberculosis of the spine marrow. Towards the end,\nKierkegaard affirmed to Emil Boesen\u2014a lifelong friend and a\npriest in the church that Kierkegaard had attacked\u2014that he was\nstill a believer in Christ.\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s biographers paint dramatically different pictures\nof these events. Walter Lowrie\u2019s early biography (Lowrie 1938)\nis a work of loving devotion, as Lowrie spent a great deal of his\nlater life translating Kierkegaard into English. Joakim Garff\u2019s\nportrait (2000, English translation 2005) is far more critical and\nprovides unflattering interpretations of many of the key events in\nKierkegaard\u2019s life. The biographies by Alastair Hannay (2001),\nStephen Backhouse (2016), and Clare Carlisle (2019) all fall somewhere\nin between these two extremes.\n\nAlthough Kierkegaard died aged only 42, his writings are vast. One\naspect of these writings likely to strike those encountering him for\nthe first time as peculiar is the fact that\u2014aside from the\n\u201cattack upon Christendom\u201d writings of the final years and\na voluminous body of journal and notebook entries\u2014the authorship\ndivides broadly into two distinct kinds of text: those written under a\nvariety of pseudonyms (the \u201cpseudonymous\u201d authorship) and\nthose written under his own name (the \u201csigned\u201d or\n\u201cveronymous\u201d authorship). Several of the pseudonymous\nauthors, some of whose names are significant, represent different\nlife-views, such as the contrast between the \u201caesthetic\u201d\nand \u201cethical\u201d lives sketched through the multiple voices\nof Either/Or (more of which below). Others represent figures\nwho explore the life of faith from perspectives outside Christianity\n(such as Johannes de silentio, the author of Fear and\nTrembling) and Johannes Climacus (a self-described\n\u201chumorist\u201d whose two books, Philosophical\nFragments and its Concluding Unscientific Postscript,\nare written from a standpoint that falls short of the paradoxical\n\u201cReligiousness B\u201d that represents Christianity in the\nlatter work). One way of characterizing this pseudonymous authorship\nis to think of it as one vast novel, with the various pseudonymous\nauthors who figure in the works being characters therein. Although\nsome (e.g., Mackey 1986) have claimed that \u201cS.\nKierkegaard\u201d is ultimately just another pseudonym, this remains\na minority view.\n\nAmongst the signed literature, there are different types of texts,\nsuch as \u201cupbuilding\u201d or \u201cedifying\u201d discourses\n(Taler: speeches; talks); \u201cdeliberations;\u201d\n(Overveielser) and reviews. In the early 1840s, Kierkegaard\noften published a collection of such discourses at the same time as a\npseudonymous work, describing them as offered with the right and left\nhand respectively. Scholars have sometimes distinguished these earlier\nreligious discourses from later, explicitly Christian discourses,\nwhich latter group would include one of the most important works of\nKierkegaard\u2019s mature ethics, Works of Love.\nTechnically, the essays about Christian love that make up that text\nconsist not of \u201cdiscourses\u201d (Taler) but\n\u201cdeliberations\u201d (Overveielser). According to\nKierkegaard\u2019s own explanation of the distinction in his\njournals, whereas an upbuilding \u201cdiscourse\u201d presupposes\nthat people know what, say, love is and aims to win them over to it, a\n\u201cdeliberation\u201d must first unsettle a comfortable way of\nthinking, and so also aims to awaken; provoke; and sharpen thought. As\nnoted, in addition to his published works Kierkegaard kept extensive\njournals and notebooks, clearly expecting\u2014correctly\u2014that\nthese too would eventually be published.\n\nThe use of pseudonyms gives the reader the additional\u2014some would\nsay prior\u2014task of wondering where Kierkegaard stands in all\nthis. One figure with a peculiar status amongst the pseudonyms is\nAnti-Climacus, the only pseudonym other than Johannes Climacus to\nauthor more than one book (The Sickness Unto Death and\nPractice in Christianity). Many scholars have treated\nAnti-Climacus as only \u201cweakly\u201d pseudonymous, taking him to\narticulate views Kierkegaard himself holds, but which he considers\nhimself to lack the authority to pronounce in his own name. In this\nsense, Anti-Climacus has often been read as the \u201chighest\u201d\nKierkegaardian voice.\n\nSome strategies have been defended as giving a window into\nKierkegaard\u2019s own views in relation to the pseudonyms. One is to\nlook for common themes and conceptual perspectives that are shared by\nmost or (in some cases) nearly all the pseudonyms, such as the view\nthat there are distinct \u201cstages\u201d or \u201cspheres\u201d\nof existence (to be discussed below). It is reasonable to see these\ncommon elements as distinctively \u201cKierkegaardian\u201d. Another\nstrategy is to compare the pseudonymous works to the signed works, on\nthe assumption that the latter provide a baseline because they embody\nwhat Kierkegaard wanted to put forward under his own name. This\nsometimes makes it possible to have some idea of what Kierkegaard\nhimself thought of the pseudonyms. Some, such as Johannes Climacus,\nseem closer to Kierkegaard than others, such as Judge William and the\nSeducer in Either/Or. Part of the evidence for this is that\nKierkegaard inserted his own name on the title page as editor of the\ntwo Climacus books, describing this as a \u201chint\u201d for those\nwho care about such things.\n\nIt certainly seems rash to attribute all the things said by the\npseudonyms to Kierkegaard, especially since Kierkegaard himself\nexplicitly requested that anyone citing these works should make the\nattribution to the pseudonyms rather than himself (CUP I 627/SKS 7,\n571). On the other hand, even if the pseudonyms had been actual\nindividuals distinct from Kierkegaard, it would not follow that they\nnever say things he would agree with, and it seems reasonable to think\nthat Kierkegaard had some ends of his own that he seeks to accomplish\nby the creation of the pseudonyms.\n\nWhat were those ends? In The Point of View for My Work as an\nAuthor (written 1848, published posthumously)\nKierkegaard\u2014in his own voice\u2014claims that he was from first\nto last a religious author, and thus that the pseudonymous works also\nserve religious ends, despite the fact that many of those works are\nnot explicitly religious in character. This claim has been hotly\ncontested, with some critics arguing that The Point of View\nrepresents what Kierkegaard later wanted his readers to think rather\nthan being an honest account of his intentions\u2014and that other\nelements of his writings, such as the journals, are similarly\nunreliable (see, e.g., Fenger 1976 [1980], Mackey 1986, Garff 2000\n[2005]). Interestingly, Kierkegaard seems in part to concede his\ncritics\u2019 point, since he admits that the unity he sees in the\nauthorship was not one he had in mind from the beginning, but rather\none that he came to understand as the authorship developed. In any\ncase, Kierkegaard agrees that an author\u2019s assertions about his\nwork should not always be taken at face value, and he asks his readers\nto discern for themselves whether the unity he claims to be present\nhelps to make sense of the whole. A rough characterization of the\nunity Kierkegaard himself sees could be summarized as follows:\nKierkegaard believes that genuine religious faith requires\n\u201cinwardness\u201d or \u201csubjectivity\u201d as its\npresupposition. The pseudonymous works, including those not explicitly\nreligious, can be seen as intended \u201cindirectly\u201d to\nencourage readers to \u201cbecome subjective\u201d, thus providing a\nbetter possibility of an understanding of religious existence. One\npiece of evidence Kierkegaard brings forward in support of the\nreligious character of the writings is the fact that the early\npseudonymous works were always \u201caccompanied\u201d by signed\nreligious works. Thus, one cannot reasonably claim that the religious\nis something that only emerges relatively late in the course of his\nauthorship.\n\nOne can therefore understand why, at least in retrospect, Kierkegaard\nsaw the whole of his authorship, including the pseudonymous works, as\ndevoted to the cause of \u201creintroducing Christianity into\nChristendom\u201d, one of the characteristic ways he describes the\ngoal of his writings. This phrase captures both the idea that\nKierkegaard saw himself as a defender of \u201cNew Testament\nChristianity\u201d and the way he saw himself as a critic of the\n\u201ccultural Christianity\u201d found in Denmark at the time,\nwhich assumed that virtually every Dane was a Christian and\nthus\u2014Kierkegaard thought\u2014conflated even lukewarm\n\u201cnominal\u201d Christianity with genuine faith.\nKierkegaard\u2019s critique of \u201cChristendom\u201d led to\ntensions with his older brother, Peter Christian Kierkegaard, who was\na follower of N. F. S. Grundtvig, a hugely influential Danish pastor\nand author who had, in S\u00f8ren\u2019s eyes, blended Scandinavian\nculture and Christian faith in a way that was detrimental to the\nlatter.\n\nOne interesting feature of Kierkegaard\u2019s reception is that,\ndespite his own Christian motivations, the writings have often had a\nhuge influence on non-Christian thinkers, who have found inspiration\nin elements of his thought\u2014such as the analysis of human\nexistence (see\n section 2\n below)\u2014that can be detached from Kierkegaard\u2019s own\nreligious framework. These would include such figures as Heidegger and\nthe Swiss psychiatrist and pioneer of existential psychotherapy,\nLudwig Binswanger, who judged The Sickness Unto Death as a\ntext which more than any other had the potential to \u201cadvance the\nexistential-analytic interpretation of schizophrenia\u201d\n(Binswanger 1958: 297; cf. also Laing 1960). It is also intriguing\nthat Kierkegaard was translated into Japanese before he was translated\ninto English (albeit initially via German rather than directly from\nDanish). The influence of Kierkegaard is clear in later Japanese\nthinkers such as Kitaro Nishida\u2019s attempt to create a synthesis\nbetween eastern Buddhist thought and European philosophy. (On\nKierkegaard in Japan, see Otani 1957 [2011], Mortensen 1996, Giles\n2008; for Kierkegaard\u2019s reception in other non-western\nEuropean/north American contexts, see Stewart 2007\u201317, Vol. 8\nTome III.) In some ways this breadth of reception is not surprising\nsince the \u201cinwardness\u201d Kierkegaard sought to cultivate is\nhuman inwardness, and many of his analyses and descriptions do not\npresuppose any dogmatic foundations.\n\nOne theme that can be found in both the pseudonymous and signed\nwritings is the distinction between direct and indirect communication.\nKierkegaard consistently maintains that ethical and religious truth\ncannot be directly or \u201cimmediately\u201d communicated to\nothers. Understanding such truths requires a \u201cdouble\nreflection\u201d. Since they are truths that pertain essentially to\nexistence or how life should be lived, it is possible to have a purely\nverbal or conceptual understanding of such truths that is nonetheless\na misunderstanding. To successfully grasp such communications, the\nrecipient must not only understand the sentences communicated, but\nmust think through what it would mean to embody or\n\u201creduplicate\u201d those ideals in existence. Kierkegaard\nthinks that the communicator must keep this in mind and artistically\nattempt to communicate in a manner that will discourage purely verbal\nunderstanding and encourage appropriation. The use of the pseudonyms\nis in part an attempt to do this. Rather than simply tell us in a\ndidactic manner about the various forms human existence can take, such\nas the aesthetic, ethical, and religious lives, the pseudonyms embody\nthese various ways of understanding human life. Kierkegaard hopes that\nreaders who engage with the pseudonymous characters might come to\nunderstand their own lives better, in much the same way as\nencountering the characters in a great novel can foster greater\nself-understanding, whether one sees oneself as like those characters\nor as very different from them. There is thus a strong novelistic or\n\u201cpoetic\u201d character to the pseudonymous authorship, and it\nseems right to pay attention to the literary form of\nKierkegaard\u2019s work, just as Plato scholars often pay close\nattention to the literary form of Plato\u2019s dialogues.\n2. Kierkegaard\u2019s Analysis of Human Existence: Despair, Social Critique, and Anxiety\n\nKierkegaard does not think of the human self predominantly as a kind\nof metaphysical substance, but rather more like an achievement, a goal\nto strive for. To be sure, humans are substances of a sort; they exist\nin the world, as do physical objects. However, what is distinctive\nabout human selves is that the self must become what it is to become,\nhuman selves playing an active role in the process by which they come\nto define themselves. This idea is familiar from existentialist\nthinkers such as Sartre, and we can thereby understand why Kierkegaard\nis often described as the \u201cfather of existentialism\u201d\n(however unhelpful that label may otherwise be). However, as we shall\nsee below, one important difference from Sartre is that for\nKierkegaard the idea of existentialist \u201cself-creation\u201d\n(or, perhaps better, \u201cself-shaping\u201d) needs to be\nsynthesized with \u201cself-acceptance:\u201d a recognition that the\nself is in some sense given by our limitations and certain facts of\nbiology and history (for this terminology, see Rudd 2012).\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s picture of selfhood is perhaps most clearly on\ndisplay in The Sickness Unto Death, one of two works in his\nauthorship described on the title page as \u201cpsychological\u201d.\nAlthough Sickness is attributed to the \u201chigher\u201d\npseudonym Anti-Climacus, much of its account of the structure of the\nhuman self can be found in other Kierkegaardian writings, both signed\nand pseudonymous. Like Hegel, Anti-Climacus holds both that human\nbeings are to be understood as \u201cspirit\u201d, and that spirit\nmust become itself through a process. The major difference is that\nHegel sees spirit as manifested in all of reality and particularly in\nhumanity as a whole, whereas Anti-Climacus focuses on the individual\nhuman self.\n\nPerhaps another similarity to Hegel is that there is a\n\u201cdialectical\u201d character to the human self understood as\nspirit. Becoming spirit is seen as an on-going \u201csynthesis\u201d\nof contrasting fundamental characteristics: the finite and the\ninfinite, the temporal and the eternal; the necessary and the\npossible. Much about the self is fixed and cannot be chosen. Humans\nare born with particular biological characteristics, in a particular\nplace and time, into a world that is not of their own making. However,\nas self-conscious beings, humans still contain possibilities to be\nactualized. The Sickness Unto Death describes various ways in\nwhich humans fail to synthesize these contrasting features and thus\nfall into despair, which is seen not merely as an emotion but as the\nstate in which the self fails to become a self in truth. For instance,\nthe person in the grip of the \u201cdespair of possibility\u201d\nloses contact with necessity and thus lives in a world of imagination\nthat is disconnected from actuality. While such a person recognizes\nthat concrete possibilities must be chosen from a range of options,\nthey misuse their imagination to generate an endless series of\npossibilities, thus postponing (and evading) the need for choice and\naction. The task is somehow to actualize \u201cthe eternal\u201d\n(possibilities) as a temporal being. The person in the \u201cdespair\nof necessity\u201d is on the other hand a fatalist of sorts who,\nhaving lost hope, sees no imaginative possibilities that can be\nincorporated into his or her life. Necessity alone, Anti-Climacus\nclaims, is suffocating. Possibility is, spiritually speaking, like\noxygen: one cannot breathe pure oxygen, but neither can one breathe\nwithout it.\n\nThere is in Kierkegaard\u2019s view of the human self as spirit one\nother fundamental difference from Hegel\u2019s concept of spirit.\nHegel\u2019s dialectic (at least on some interpretations) comes to\nrest when the conflicting moments are reconciled in a final, higher\nunity. For Kierkegaard, however, the human self is fundamentally\ntemporal and (at least prior to death) is always an unfinished\nproject. The task of balancing the elements of human selfhood\n(necessity and possibility, eternity and temporality) so as to avoid\ndespair is never completed short of the grave.\n\nDespite Kierkegaard\u2019s reputation as an\n\u201cindividualist\u201d, he does not see the process of becoming a\nself as one that is carried out by an autonomous, isolated self. As\nself-conscious beings, humans can \u201cstep back\u201d from\nthemselves and \u201crelate themselves to themselves\u201d. However,\nAnti-Climacus insists that the human self cannot \u201crelate itself\nto itself\u201d alone, but always by \u201crelating \u2026 to\nanother\u201d. All of us in some ways live in relation to ideals, but\nthose ideals come from outside the self and provide a basis for\nself-definition. Anti-Climacus clearly thinks that for the human self\nto be healthy, free from the despair that is \u201cthe sickness unto\ndeath\u201d, the \u201cother\u201d who is the basis for the self\nmust be God, who created the self but gave it a kind of freedom by\n\u201creleasing it from his hand, as it were\u201d (SUD 16/SKS 11,\n132). However, both Kierkegaard and Anti-Climacus recognize that in\nreality most human selves are defined by \u201cothers\u201d very\ndifferent from God. We attempt to ground our identities in\n\u201cworldly distinctions\u201d such as riches and fame or define\nourselves by our devotion to abstractions that have the potential to\nbecome idols, such as nation, race or class. On Kierkegaard\u2019s\nview, only when one is defined by a commitment to what is absolute and\ninfinite (God) can one be freed from the constricting labels and\nconformist roles that society attempts to impose on all of us. This is\nparticularly so in a modern society that is shaped by \u201cthe\npress\u201d, and which seeks to \u201clevel\u201d the distinctive\nindividual who dares to be faithful to an individual calling. This\ninfluential critique of modern societies is found in such essays as\nA Literary Review. There, Kierkegaard describes the aspects\nof disengagement mentioned above in connection with certain modes of\nphilosophizing (see further\n \u00a73.1\n below) as part of a broader problem with the culture of his age. He\ncontrasts the passionate \u201cage of revolution\u201d with\n\u201cthe present age\u201d\u2014indolent; excessively reflective;\napathetic; and envy-fueled. Each age has its risks, but one of the\nproblems with the present age is precisely that it is one of\n\u201cleveling\u201d, in which genuine excellence is stifled by the\n\u201cmonstrous abstraction\u201d (TA 90/SKS 8, 86) which\nKierkegaard labels \u201cthe public\u201d, an unaccountable\n\u201cphantom\u201d created by \u201cthe press\u201d and in whose\nname all kinds of injustices are perpetuated. While Kierkegaard was\nsurely influenced here by the \u201cCorsair affair\u201d, his\nanalysis of \u201cthe present age\u201d has often been taken as an\nastute anticipation of concerns later critics have raised about the\nmass media (and, latterly, elements of social media: one might think\nof the \u201calgorithms\u201d of Facebook and Twitter as the kind of\nfaceless, anonymous \u201cphantoms\u201d that Kierkegaard had in\nmind).\n\nAs already noted, Kierkegaard believes that the task of becoming a\nself requires \u201cinwardness\u201d or \u201csubjectivity\u201d,\nand that merely amassing objective knowledge or taking a detached\nperspective on intellectual questions by itself leads one away from\nselfhood. In Concluding Unscientific Postscript Johannes\nClimacus argues that reflection, though a crucial and necessary\nelement in human life, by itself cannot lead to choices (see Evans\n2006: 311\u2013326). In an argument that resembles David Hume\u2019s\nclaim that \u201creason is, and ought only to be the slave of the\npassions\u2026\u201d, (Hume 1739\u201340 [1888: 415]) Climacus\nsays that reflection itself has a kind of inner infinity. A person\nthinking about a decision can always go on thinking and so long as\nthat is happening, cannot decide. What must happen is that the person\nmust desire to make a choice, and thus will to stop the process of\nreflection by identifying with a possibility to be actualized.\n\nPrior to the analysis of despair given in The Sickness Unto\nDeath, Kierkegaard\u2019s pseudonym Vigilius Haufniensis (a\nLatinized version of \u201cThe Watchman of Copenhagen\u201d)\nprovided an influential treatment of another significant human\npsychological state in The Concept of Anxiety. On the surface\nthis book is an inquiry into the nature of original or\n\u201chereditary\u201d sin, but in reality it probes the nature of\nhuman choice in general, particularly the origins of evil. While\nHaufniensis claims that evil or sin cannot be scientifically explained\nbecause it has its origins in freedom, he nonetheless believes that\nanxiety helps us to understand how sin is possible. Anxiety is not\nmerely a pathological condition which is a symptom of disease, but\npart of the human condition itself. It is an awareness of freedom.\nWhen we are anxious, we feel a \u201csympathetic antipathy\u201d or\nan \u201cantipathetic sympathy\u201d (CA 42/SKS 4, 348) in which we\nare both drawn towards and repelled by some possibility. How exactly\nfreedom comes to be misused is not made altogether clear by\nHaufniensis, who says that\n\n\nanxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit\nwants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own\npossibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. (CA 61/ SKS\n4, 365)\n\n\nThis \u201clooking down\u201d produces anxiety, which is the state\nthat precedes sin, though Haufniensis is clear that a morally free\naction always comes from a \u201cleap\u201d and cannot be seen as\nnecessary (CA 48\u201351/SKS 4, 353\u20137). Perhaps the best\nscholarly treatment of these matters is found in Michelle Kosch\n(2006), who convincingly argues that Kierkegaard is responding to\nKant-inspired debates about human freedom and autonomy in Fichte and\nSchelling, and usefully shows the relevance of Kierkegaard\u2019s\nviews to contemporary debates about the human will. Haufniensis does\nclaim that when freedom is misused, anxiety takes on a pathological\ncharacter, but the cure is not the total elimination of anxiety.\nRather, what is crucial is to learn to be anxious properly:\n\u201cWhoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned\nthe ultimate\u201d (CA 155; SKS 4, 454).\n3. The \u201cSpheres of Existence\u201d or \u201cStages on Life\u2019s Way\u201d\n\nA common way to interpret Kierkegaard\u2019s thought is in terms of\nthree \u201cexistence-spheres\u201d: the aesthetic, the ethical and\nthe religious. The idea that there are precisely three such spheres is\nan over-simplification, as this reckons without important subdivisions\nin this schema (such as different kinds of aesthete; the different\nresonances of especially \u201cthe ethical\u201d in different texts;\nsub-divisions in the religious (\u201cReligiousness A\u201d and\n\u201cReligiousness B\u201d); and the \u201cboundary zones\u201d\nof \u201cirony\u201d and \u201chumor\u201d.) Nonetheless, this\nstructure does give some purchase on Kierkegaard\u2019s view of\ndifferent ways to become\u2014or fail to become\u2014a human\n\u201cself\u201d. Indeed, some have seen \u201cbecoming a\nself\u201d as the key topic of Kierkegaard\u2019s thought,\nand the existence-spheres as crucial to understanding this. One way of\napproaching the existence-spheres is to see them as different views of\nwhat gives a human life value. Kierkegaard often uses an imagery of\nheight in describing the spheres, such as a famous passage in The\nSickness Unto Death in which Anti-Climacus accuses most people of\nliving in a multi-story house and yet preferring to live in the\nbasement (in \u201csensate\u201d categories as opposed to aiming to\nbecome \u201cspirit\u201d) (SUD 43/SKS 11, 158). That is,\nKierkegaard often reads as if the existence-spheres operate in a\nhierarchy, with the aesthetic as \u201clowest\u201d and\nReligiousness B as \u201chighest\u201d. However, this is arguably\ntoo simple: even if Kierkegaard does see the movement from the\naesthetic and the ethical to the religious as progress, it would be a\nmistake to think of this in a purely linear way. There are ways in\nwhich an ethical character such as Judge William may be inferior to an\naesthete such as \u201cA\u201d, and insights to be found in the\naesthetes that are not repudiated or surpassed by what might be\ndescribed as a \u201chigher\u201d pseudonym.\n\nKierkegaard also describes these spheres as \u201cstages\u201d\n(Stadier)\u2014as in the title Stages on Life\u2019s\nWay. The term \u201cstage\u201d might be taken as a\npsychological descriptive term, but this too can be misleading.\nKierkegaard is certainly not simply providing an empirical description\nof how humans develop. It is true that children are natural aesthetes,\nand that this is where human existence always begins. So one might say\nthat a typical human life would begin with aesthetic concerns, develop\nethical commitments, and over time, reflecting on the problems posed\nby ethical existence, could struggle with religious questions which\nare linked to the problems of guilt and suffering that ethical life\nraises but does not solve. However, not everyone follows such a path,\nand even when someone does, the later stages do not simply replace the\nearlier ones. Kierkegaard consistently maintains that all human life\ncontains an aesthetic dimension, so the aesthetic is never really left\nbehind.\n\nFurthermore, humans for Kierkegaard are spiritual creatures, and this\nmeans that the transitions from one stage to another do not happen\nautomatically or inevitably. Rather, the transitions are achievements\nthat require the transformation of the \u201cpassions\u201d that\nshape a human life, what Kierkegaard calls \u201csubjectivity\u201d\nor \u201cinwardness\u201d. It is for this reason that, for instance,\nthe aesthete can choose to remain an aesthete, making this way of life\na rival to an ethical or religious life. When understood in this way\nthe term \u201cspheres\u201d seems superior to \u201cstages\u201d\nas it recognizes that these different views of human existence can be\nrivals, with different views of what makes human life worthwhile and\nmeaningful. Even though Kierkegaard himself clearly believed that deep\nand authentic forms of ethical life point towards the religious, he\nalso recognizes that there are forms of ethical life that are at best\nreligious in a conventional or superficial way (as illustrated,\narguably, by Judge William, to be discussed in\n \u00a73.2\n below). Let us turn, then, to aspects of each of the\n\u201cexistence-spheres\u201d in more detail.\n3.1 The Aesthetic\n\nThe first volume of Either/Or consists of the papers of a\nnameless young man, known only as \u201cA\u201d, who in a series of\nsometimes witty, sometimes rambling, sometimes astute and sometimes\ndespairing writings, presents a view of what it means to live\n\u201caesthetically\u201d. As is clearest in his essay \u201cCrop\nRotation\u201d, he sets himself the task of living to avoid boredom\nat all costs. On one level, the aesthetic life can be understood as\nthe ceaseless pursuit of \u201cthe interesting\u201d. But there is\nan irony in this: paralleling Kant\u2019s notion of a judgment of\nbeauty as involving disinterested satisfaction, the aesthete\nultimately brings an attitude of disinterested, disengaged\ncontemplation to life as a whole, viewing it as a spectacle to be\nsavored rather than as involving \u201ctasks\u201d or projects to be\nfulfilled. His is the view of a spectator rather than a player. Often\nseen as a critique of German romanticism, this highlights a vital\ndistinction in Kierkegaard\u2019s thought, between the engaged and\ndisengaged perspectives. Kierkegaard thinks that the disengaged,\ntheoretical standpoint on life will necessarily overlook crucial\nexistential problems, since these only properly come into view from a\nfirst-person perspective. To draw on one of Climacus\u2019 examples,\nunderstanding in the abstract that since I am mortal, I will one day\ndie, is very different from earnestly confronting what my certain\ndeath means for how I should live my life.\n\nThe aesthete emerges as an isolated figure, recommending the reader of\n\u201cCrop Rotation\u201d to avoid boredom and preserve freedom by\nrejecting anything which involves the self in relationships of\ninter-dependence, such as marriage, friendship, or useful career.\nWhile recognizing most people\u2019s need to work for a living, he\nnevertheless counsels against allowing career or other people to be\npart of one\u2019s identity-conferring commitments. In his critique\nof the aesthetic life, the ethicist Judge William goes on to argue\nthat this is to cut oneself off from precisely the kind of freely\nchosen projects that give human life its value and purpose.\n\nThe two extremes of the aesthete life, contrasting sensuousness with\nmisused imaginative reflection, are illustrated by two kinds of\nseducer. The first, illustrated by Don Juan (which \u201cA\u201d\napproaches through the version of the character in Mozart\u2019s\nopera Don Giovanni in his essay \u201cThe Immediate Erotic\nStages or the Musical Erotic\u201d) has as the object of his desire\nthe sensual alone, as opposed to the features of a woman which make\nher a distinct individual. Nor, on this account, is Don Juan himself\nan individual, since to be so is to be determined \u201cby\nspirit\u201d. Indeed, \u201cA\u201d claims, once we think of Don\nJuan as an individual\u2014as opposed to a sensuous force that can\nonly properly be expressed in music\u2014he becomes a\ncomical figure.\n\nAs his papers reveal, one way in which \u201cA\u201d differs from\nDon Juan is that \u201cA\u201d sees a far greater use for the\nimagination. \u201cA\u201d contrasts a \u201cvulgar\u201d\nunderstanding of crop rotation\u2014always seeking new external\nstimuli\u2014with tackling boredom through utilizing the capacity of\nthe imagination. By standing back from the world, relating to it in a\ndisengaged manner, one\u2019s experiences become raw material for\nimaginative possibilities, such as by cultivating arbitrariness\n(reading part of a book; seeing the middle of a play). \u201cA\u201d\nhimself fully realizes (see for instance the section entitled\n\u201cDiapsalmata\u201d) that his lifestyle has led to a kind of\ndespair\u2014he claims that living \u201cartistically\u201d is only\npossible once \u201chope has been thrown overboard\u201d (EO I\n292/SKS 2, 282)\u2014but he sees aesthetic possibilities even in his\ndespair. After all, tragedy is one of the great categories of drama,\nand \u201cA\u201d seems to have the capacity to step back from and\nobserve his own life as a kind of tragic play. Perhaps \u201cA\u201d\nthinks that despair is preferable to boredom and can thus be a\nstrategy in its avoidance.\n\nThe flaws of his worldview are writ large in the demonic author of the\nlast and longest part of the first volume of Either/Or, the\n\u201cSeducer\u2019s Diary\u201d. (The text leaves unclear whether\nwe are supposed to take this to be \u201cA\u201d himself.) This\nsecond seducer\u2014another Johannes\u2014represents an extreme\nmisuse of the imagination: someone so far gone in the life of the\nimagination as to have become damaged by it. Johannes gains his\ngratification from the art of planning seduction, with ultimate\nsuccess sparking boredom and the desire to move on. The Diary\u2019s\npainstaking account of the details of a particular seduction plot\nreveal him as deeply manipulative; thoroughly disengaged (viewing\nwoman as\u2014merely\u2014an endlessly fascinating topic for his\nobservations and reflections); and ultimately self-deceived, both\nabout his motives and about whether a life lived almost entirely in\nthe realm of the imagination is a defensible human life. Johannes the\nSeducer has embraced a reflective type of enjoyment, including\n\u201creflective grief\u201d, as a form of aesthetic experience that\ncan be sustained, perhaps recognizing that the \u201cimmediate\u201d\nsensuousness of Don Juan cannot be realized in an actual person.\nNevertheless, his turn away from \u201cimmediacy\u201d does not seem\nto work; he constantly seems to need jolts of immediate enjoyment and\ndesire to rejuvenate his projects. When his seduction of his quarry\nCordelia finally succeeds, the actual sexual encounter seems strangely\nanti-climactic, and it is immediately followed by boredom and even\ncynicism. Yet one level of the Seducer\u2019s self-deception subtly\nindicates the demands of the ethical: by convincing himself that he\nhasn\u2019t really treated these women so badly, Johannes shows that\non some level he recognizes that the ethical does make demands on him.\nMany of these points are subtly elaborated in Karsten Harries\u2019\nrich commentary on Either/Or (Harries 2010).\n3.2 The Ethical\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s most famous spokesman for the ethical life is\nknown as Judge (or \u201cAssessor\u201d) William. In his\ntwo\u2014very\u2014long letters to his young friend \u201cA\u201d,\nWilliam\u2019s strategy has an \u201cindirect\u201d element: he\naims to show how the ethical life provides what the aesthete claims to\ncare about (for instance, romantic love) better than the aesthetic\nlife itself can. (Witness the titles the book\u2019s editor, Victor\nEremita, gives to the letters: \u201cThe Aesthetic Validity of\nMarriage\u201d and \u201cEquilibrium between the Aesthetic and the\nEthical in the Development of Personality\u201d.) At the heart of the\nJudge\u2019s worldview is the idea that living a fully human life\nnecessarily involves the kind of commitments of which \u201cA\u201d\nis so wary: relationships and social roles can legitimately be\nidentity-conferring in an important sense. This is a key respect in\nwhich the \u201cethical self\u201d contrasts with the isolated\n\u201cself\u201d of the aesthete. (It also highlights the importance\nof love in Kierkegaard\u2019s thought (see\n \u00a73.3.3\n below).) Part of William\u2019s strategy is to try to show\n\u201cA\u201d that he has deeper desires than he recognizes.\n\u201cA\u201d\u2019s namelessness has often been taken as a signal\nthat the aesthete in an important sense lacks a self; the Judge aims\nto show that the aesthete\u2019s living for \u201cthe moment\u201d\nmeans that the self becomes nothing more than a series of such\nmoments. The ethical self, by contrast, seeks a coherence and a kind\nof unity that can endure over time, rather than being a series of\ndisconnected episodes. Relationships and social roles are, for the\nJudge, key to this.\n\nIn this approach, however, \u201cthe aesthetic\u201d is not just\nsomething that is transcended, but rather something that is taken up\ninto the higher existence-spheres in a transformed way. For instance,\nat the heart of William\u2019s praise of marriage is the idea that\nthis is the way in which romantic love endures\u2014and is a better\nexpression of love\u2019s own demands. Marriage also illustrates the\nidea of the ethical as the sphere of \u201copenness\u201d or\ntransparency: marriage embodies the ethical life insofar as it\nprovides an environment in which two people can progressively reveal\nthemselves to each other over a lifetime. (Fear and Trembling\nwill go on to contrast the \u201copenness\u201d of the ethical with\ndifferent forms of concealment found in both the aesthetic and the\nreligious.)\n\nThe Judge\u2019s second letter stresses the importance of\nchoice. He urges \u201cA\u201d to \u201cchoose\ndespair\u201d, by which he means: recognize that despair arises from,\nand is essential to, the aesthetic life, and that an authentic self\ncannot be achieved thorough the aesthetic life alone. (As hinted at in\n section 2\n above, aspects of the human self\u2014possibility, necessity,\nfinitude, infinitude\u2014have their own characteristic forms of\ndespair, each rooted either in a lack of imagination or in a misuse of\nthe imagination.) His key theme is to try to persuade the aesthete\nthat choosing \u201caesthetically\u201d is not really choosing at\nall; that he needs to \u201cchoose choice itself:\u201d take\nresponsibility for the person he has become, as the first step in\naiming to change it. One way of glossing the claim that\n\u201cA\u201d lacks a self is that the aesthetic life is one of\nself-alienation (the Judge alleges that \u201cA\u201d\n\u201ccontinually hover[s] above\u201d himself (EO II 198/SKS 3,\n192)). By contrast, the ethical self contains elements of\nself-acceptance\u2014the facticity of one\u2019s life\u2014as well\nas what might be called \u201cself-shaping\u201d\u2014that which\ncan be chosen (Rudd 2012). As the Judge puts it, \u201cthe I chooses\nitself\u2014or, more correctly, receives [or \u2018accepts\u2019]\nitself [det modtager sig selv]\u201d (EO II, 177/SKS 3,\n172). In this way, the ethical self strives for a balance which avoids\nthe despair of possibility (the excessive plenitude of choice that\nparalyses the will) and the despair of necessity (the complete absence\nof choice). At the heart of this notion of choice is the view that\nfreedom is found in voluntary self-limitation, as illustrated by the\nJudge\u2019s claim that his devotion to his work, his wife and his\nchildren is less a sacrifice than the source of his joy and\nsatisfaction. Precursors of this view which are likely influences on\nKierkegaard here include Luther\u2019s idea that freedom is being\nable to transcend the demands of one\u2019s baser inclinations\nwillingly to obey God\u2019s law (see especially \u201cThe Freedom\nof a Christian\u201d), and Hegel\u2019s recognition of our mutual\ninterdependence in the thought that true freedom involves recognizing\nthat what may initially appear to be a \u201cconstraining\nother\u201d is, in a deeper sense, part of the self. Contemporary\nparallels which have interested Kierkegaard scholars include Harry\nFrankfurt\u2019s idea that unlimited \u201cfreedom\u201d would lead\nto the evaporation of identity (see for instance Frankfurt 1988:\n177\u2013190) and the importance of acquiring a \u201chigher\norder\u201d will (see the essays in Rudd and Davenport 2015).\n\nIn all this, we see that a key contrast is between a life viewed in\nterms of mere possibilities (the aesthetic) and in terms of\n\u201ctasks\u201d (the ethical). Insofar as a person recognizes\n\u201cchoice\u201d as a task (as opposed to being an essentially\narbitrary selection from an array of possibilities), she has\neffectively already chosen the ethical.\n\nInterpreters of Kierkegaard have disagreed on whether the ethical is a\nnecessary, if intermediate, stage on the route to a\n\u201chigher\u201d existence-sphere, or whether there is an element\nof na\u00efvet\u00e9 to William\u2019s valorization of conventional\nsocial norms (cf. Hegelian Sittlichkeit) which sophisticated\naesthetes have already seen through and rejected. A related debate has\narisen from Alasdair MacIntyre\u2019s claim, in his A Short\nHistory of Ethics and After Virtue, that the choice\nbetween the aesthetic and the ethical is arbitrary or\n\u201ccriterionless\u201d, (MacIntyre 1981 [1984]).\nMacIntyre\u2019s view has been much discussed since, though\nKierkegaard scholars have been almost unanimous in their rejection of\nit. MacIntyre subsequently amended his position, while nevertheless\nre-stating the \u201ccriterionless choice\u201d charge in a\ndifferent form (see MacIntyre 2001, esp. 344). Subsequent discussion\nhas focused on whether Kierkegaard\u2019s project is in fact far\ncloser to MacIntyre\u2019s own than the latter realized, one\ncomponent of this debate being whether it is helpful to think of the\nethical in terms of some sort of \u201cnarrative unity\u201d (for\ncontributions, see the essays in Davenport and Rudd 2001, Lippitt\n2007, Rudd 2012, Davenport 2012, Lippitt 2013b [for an overview],\nStokes 2015, the essays in Lippitt and Stokes 2015, and Compaijen\n2018).\n\nCertainly, the Judge\u2019s somewhat complacent trust in\nSittlichkeit raises several important questions. Do we really\nhave such clearly defined positions and duties? Can\nSittlichkeit do justice to individual uniqueness? What\nunderlying principle can justify which roles and projects we\n\u201cchoose\u201d to take on? Without an answer to this last\nquestion, some have seen there to be a hidden complicity between the\naesthetic and the ethical, such that the ethical is not really the\nadvance on the aesthetic that the Judge supposes. And this conception\nof the ethical certainly founders against conceptions of the religious\nexistence-sphere envisaged elsewhere in the authorship. The Judge sees\nhimself as a religious person, but his religiosity does not seem as\ncentral to his identity as his earthly commitments. Certainly, his\nreligious faith does not challenge or unsettle his conventional\nlifestyle, as would be the case in Kierkegaard\u2019s later\ndescriptions of a religious life that is distinctly and radically\nChristian.\n\nOf each of the three existence-spheres, the ethical is perhaps the\nhardest to pin down, the meaning of the term shifting across texts. In\nboth Either/Or and Fear and Trembling (in the\njudgment of most scholars), the ethical is seen primarily as\nSittlichkeit: grounded\u2014as for Hegel\u2014in social\nrequirements and expectations. (That said, there has been considerable\ndiscussion about whether the conception of the ethical in Fear and\nTrembling is Kantian (e.g., Pojman 1984, Hampson 2013), Fichtean\n(Kosch 2006) or Hegelian (e.g., Evans 2004, Walsh 2009, Westphal\n2014)). But there is an important difference between the two texts.\nJudge William seems mostly oblivious to the possibility that there\ncould be a need for anything higher than this kind of ethical life.\nHowever, in Fear and Trembling Johannes de silentio is\nfascinated by the Biblical story of the akedah, the binding\nof Isaac by Abraham (Genesis 22: 1\u201318). Abraham is seen as\nembodying a life of faith that cannot be reduced to\nSittlichkeit, for reasons that we shall see in the next\nsection.\n\nConcluding Unscientific Postscript offers an account of the\nethical life that sees it as the beginning of a kind of\n\u201cimmanent\u201d religious existence (\u201cReligiousness\nA\u201d) that is possible for humans apart from any transcendent\nrevelation. Here the ethical life requires \u201can absolute relation\nto the absolute\u201d that relativizes all earthly commitments,\nleading to resignation, suffering, and, ultimately, an encounter with\nguilt. Religiousness A, which is distinct from Christianity (what\nClimacus calls \u201cReligiousness B\u201d) is seen a providing the\n\u201cpathos\u201d or inwardness that is necessary for a person to\nbecome a Christian, though even here there is no direct or immediate\ntransition possible to Christianity as a \u201ctranscendent\u201d\nform of religious existence.\n\nA price is paid, however, for focusing exclusively on the pseudonymous\nworks for accounts of Kierkegaard\u2019s account of \u201cthe\nethical\u201d. The most obvious exclusion would be Works of\nLove, arguably the most important work of Kierkegaard\u2019s\nmature Christian ethics. But it would also overlook some profound\nreflections to be found in the upbuilding discourses on virtues needed\nfor ethical as well as religious life (such as courage, forgivingness,\ngratitude, hope, humility, patience) as well as more unusual spiritual\nqualities (such as \u201cjoy\u201d [gl\u00e6de]) and, of\ncourse, faith itself. (For an in-depth treatment of\nKierkegaard\u2019s account of a number of virtues, see Roberts\n2022.)\n3.3 The Religious and the Life of Faith\n\nWhile Kierkegaard does not explicitly explore faith, hope and love as\nthe three theological virtues, all three notions play important roles\nin his thought, and can be used to amplify his view of the religious\nlife.\n3.3.1 Faith\n\nFaith is a major theme across Kierkegaard\u2019s authorship. It is\nthe central issue of Fear and Trembling (which as noted\nexplores the nature of faith through an investigation of one of its\nkey biblical exemplars, Abraham), while in later writings Kierkegaard\nexplores in various ways the nature of specifically Christian\nfaith.\n\nSince Fear and Trembling is probably the best-known and most\nread of Kierkegaard\u2019s works, the views of its pseudonymous\nauthor are often taken to be Kierkegaard\u2019s own. But since\nJohannes de silentio claims to be an outsider to \u201cfaith\u201d,\nand repeatedly tells us he cannot understand Abraham, this is a\ndangerous move. Johannes\u2019 focus is on the events of Genesis 22,\nwherein Abraham receives the shocking command to sacrifice his\nlong-awaited son Isaac on Mount Moriah. Abraham shows his willingness\nto do so over a three-day journey, right up to the binding and drawing\nof the knife. Yet at the last minute God sends an angel to prevent the\nkilling, Abraham instead sacrificing a ram caught by its horns in a\nthicket.\n\nThis is the exemplar of faith that Johannes struggles to understand.\nHe tells and retells the story of Abraham in multiple versions, aiming\nto get closer to understanding faith by contrasting it with\nsuperficially similar but ultimately different cases of\nwhat-faith-is-not. One development in scholarly interpretation over\nthe decades has been a shift away from a tendency in some earlier\nscholarship to leap instantly to the three Problems in the second part\nof the book (what Johannes calls its \u201cdialectical\u201d\nsections)\u2014especially the first, as to whether the story of\nAbraham contains a \u201cteleological suspension of the\nethical\u201d. The importance of paying attention to the earlier\nsections of the book is now widely recognized. This includes the early\naccount, in the section entitled \u201cAttunement\u201d or\n\u201cTuning Up\u201d (Stemning), of four different\nversions of the Abraham story. We might call them\n\u201csub-Abrahams\u201d (cf. Lippitt 2016). All of them are\nprepared to obey God, but each differs in various ways from the\nAbraham who is the \u201cfather of faith\u201d. This should warn us\noff readings which suggest that the central message of the\ntext\u2014and of faith\u2014is simply the importance of being\nobedient to God. Another key contrast (in the section entitled\n\u201cPreliminary Outpouring from the Heart\u201d) is between faith\nand \u201cinfinite resignation\u201d. The \u201cknight of infinite\nresignation\u201d has an openness and comprehensibility to Johannes\nthat the enigmatic \u201cknight of faith\u201d lacks. In a strategy\nnot uncommon in Kierkegaard\u2019s authorship, faith is illustrated\nby drawing a parallel with love. Specifically, silentio illustrates\nthe distinction between faith and infinite resignation through a story\nof two different versions of a young lad who falls in love with an\nunattainable princess (FT 34ff./SKS 4, 136ff.). Infinite\nresignation\u2014the first move in the \u201cdouble movement\u201d\nof faith\u2014involves the renunciation of important goods or\ncommitments in favor of those considered to be \u201chigher\u201d.\nThis sacrifice, while painful, contains a certain \u201cpeace and\nrest and consolation\u201d (FT 38/SKS 4, 140). Yet the knight of\nfaith manages fully to value finite goods (Isaac or the princess) in a\nway that his infinite resignation counterpart does not. Commentators\nhave disagreed on how to interpret this (see, e.g., Mooney 1991, R.\nHall 2000, and Davenport 2008; for a summary, see Lippitt 2016:\n59\u201373). But a key notion seems to be that whereas infinite\nresignation is something that I can achieve through my own will, the\nknight of faith both recognizes his dependence upon a divine power\nbeyond himself and trusts in God\u2019s promises\u2014even in the\nmost extraordinary \u201ctrial\u201d of the akedah\u2014in\na way that appears to an outsider like Johannes as\n\u201cabsurd\u201d. Remarkably, the knight of faith is able to take\na genuine joy in the finite world, receiving it back (in the form of\nIsaac or the princess) despite having given it up in\n\u201cresignation\u201d. Crucial here is the idea that God\u2019s\npromises are for this life, not just an after-life. The true\nmeasure of Abraham\u2019s faith is less his willingness to sacrifice\nIsaac than his trust and hope that he will \u201creceive him\nback\u201d\u2014in this life, not just in eternity.\n\nEach of the three Problems begins with the idea that \u201cthe\nethical as such is the universal\u201d, a different dimension of\nwhich is brought out in each Problem. Does Abraham\u2019s faith\ncontain a \u201cteleological suspension of the ethical\u201d?\nAbraham seems to offend against \u201cthe universal\u201d in four\nways, all closely related. First, he makes of himself an exception to\nwhat universality demands (one ought not to kill one\u2019s innocent\noffspring). This\u2014secondly\u2014amounts to the\n\u201cparadox\u201d that the \u201csingle individual\u201d stands\nhigher than the universal. Hegelian concerns about the dangers of\nsubjectivity\u2014such that Moralit\u00e4t (concerning an\nindividual\u2019s inner will or intention) needs to be subordinated\nto Sittlichkeit (the customs, norms and institutions of a\nrational society)\u2014are relevant here. The problem with Abraham is\nthat his private relationship to God is given priority over his duties\nas a social creature. Thus\u2014third\u2014Abraham stands in a\ndirect, unmediated relation to God and so\u2014fourth\u2014he cannot\nexplain his actions in publicly available, shareable language. The\nradical privacy of his God-relationship is key to understanding the\ndifference between the knight of faith and the \u201ctragic\nhero\u201d, the next on the list of what-faith-is-not. The stories of\nAgamemnon, Jepthah and Brutus (FT 50\u20132/SKS 4, 151\u20133) each\noffers another case of a father feeling the obligation to sacrifice\nhis own offspring for a cause conceived of as \u201chigher\u201d.\nThe key difference is that each of these can explain himself by giving\na publicly comprehensible account of his actions (such as a military\nleader\u2019s duties to the state overriding those to his own\nfamily). These explanations are within the realm of the ethical\nconceived of as the universal, whereas\u2014according to\nJohannes\u2014Abraham has no such explanation available to him. His\nfaith is a \u201cpurely personal virtue\u201d (FT 52/SKS 4, 153) as\nopposed to the virtue of Sittlichkeit embodied by the tragic\nhero. This relationship between the single individual and the\nuniversal is further explored in Problems II and III. The former\nfocuses on whether our duty to God is absolute; and what that implies\nin the case of the kind of direct God-relationship exemplified by\nAbraham. The lengthy Problem III, which\u2014focusing on\nAbraham\u2019s silence\u2014considers whether concealing his purpose\nfrom others (such as his son, wife and servant) was ethically\ndefensible. Problem III in particular has divided commentators, some\nviewing it as somewhat rambling, others as crucially\nimportant\u2014especially those who attribute significance to the\nbook\u2019s motto, and its apparent suggestion that the book may\ncontain a hidden message not understood by the messenger (Johannes\nhimself?). For these latter, the story of Agnete and the merman (FT\n82ff./SKS 4, 183ff.), with its discussion of sin and\nrepentance\u2014important themes elsewhere in Kierkegaard\u2019s\nauthorship\u2014has seemed particularly important (e.g., Green 1993,\nMulhall 2001, Krishek 2009; for an overview, see Lippitt 2016:\n196\u2013206).\n\nAs noted above, what Climacus in the Postscript labels\nReligiousness A is a religion of immanence that requires no\ntranscendent revelation. Genuine Christianity, on Kierkegaard\u2019s\nview, emphatically does rest on such a revelation. Johannes Climacus,\nin Philosophical Fragments, provides a humorous and ironic\nattempt to \u201cinvent\u201d something that looks suspiciously like\nChristianity. He begins with an account of the Socratic view\n(understood very much in terms of Plato\u2019s Socrates) of\n\u201cthe Truth\u201d and how it is obtained, and then seeks an\nalternative to the Socratic view that the Truth can be found through\n\u201crecollection\u201d. The alternative requires a teacher who is\ndivine, but who out of self-giving love becomes human. (The irony and\nhumor consist in a mock attempt to \u201cinvent\u201d something\nwhose essence is that it cannot be a human invention.)\n\nFragments offers the first delineation in Kierkegaard\u2019s\nauthorship of the idea that Christian faith is centered on the\nincarnation (\u201cthe God-man\u201d). The incarnation is claimed to\nbe the \u201cthe Absolute Paradox\u201d, and it is variously\ndescribed as \u201ca contradiction\u201d, or \u201cthe most\nimprobable\u201d (PF 52/ SKS 4, 256) of all things. Although both\nClimacus and Kierkegaard, in later writings, insist that the\nincarnation must be seen as an historical event, since otherwise we\nare \u201cback to Socrates\u201d, they reject any attempt to base\nfaith in the God-man on historical evidence. Rather, faith in the\nincarnation is seen as something that is given directly to the\ndisciple by the God-man, though the encounter (for later generations)\nis mediated through historical testimony. (Kierkegaard\u2019s\nnon-evidentialist account of faith can be usefully compared to the\nexternalist account of faith found in contemporary \u201cReformed\nepistemology\u201d (Evans 2006: 169\u2013182, 183\u2013205)).\nThough Kierkegaard does not write about epistemology in a systematic\nmanner, he writes about knowledge and belief in many places (see Piety\n2010 for a good overview of his thoughts on such matters). His views\nof moral and religious knowledge can also be compared to the\ncontemporary development of virtue epistemology, which puts more\nemphasis on the character of the knower in the acquisition of\nknowledge, in contrast to most modern epistemologies, which have\nfocused largely on evidence and said little about the traits or\ncharacteristics that might make it possible for a person to grasp the\ntruth.\n\nCalling the incarnation a \u201ccontradiction\u201d has suggested to\nsome that Kierkegaard is a radical fideist who sees Christian faith as\nrequiring a rejection of reason by believing what is logically\ncontradictory, a view applauded by some (e.g., Shestov 1936 [1969]),\nand decried by others (e.g., Pojman 1984). However, it is far from\nobvious that Kierkegaard saw Christian faith this way. To\nKierkegaard\u2019s Danish contemporaries, the term for\n\u201ccontradiction\u201d (Modsigelse) would not have meant\nonly or even mainly a logical contradiction. Rather, Kierkegaard\nfrequently uses the term to describe a tension or incongruity. Human\nexistence itself is described as involving the same\n\u201ccontradiction\u201d as the incarnation, the synthesizing of\ntemporality and eternity, and Kierkegaard also says that all humor\nfocuses on contradictions (by which he clearly means something like\nincongruity (Lippitt 2000: 8\u201311)). Kierkegaard certainly sees\nthe incarnation as something that human reason cannot understand; as\nsuch it poses \u201cthe possibility of offense\u201d for a person\nwho is unwilling to recognize that there could be truth that\ntranscends immanent human capacities. However, Kierkegaard also\ninsists that offense is not more rationally justified than is faith.\nFaith and offense are opposite and rival passions, and neither can be\nfully justified by reason. (For more on these issues, see Evans\n1992.)\n\nIn Kierkegaard\u2019s later writing, both in signed works and in the\nwritings of Anti-Climacus, the offense of faith is often described\nmore in ethical than intellectual terms. In these writings the\nbarriers to faith are seen as pride and selfishness, since faith in\nChrist requires a radical willingness to love the neighbor, a category\nwhich even includes one\u2019s enemies.\n3.3.2 Love\n\nScholarship over the last two decades or so has increasingly\nrecognized the importance and profundity of Kierkegaard\u2019s\nthought on love (see, e.g., R. Hall 2000, Ferreira 2001, A. Hall 2002,\nEvans 2004, Furtak 2005, Krishek 2009, Lippitt 2013a, 2020, Strawser\n2015). The question of what it means to love well is one that runs\nthrough many of his writings, pseudonymous and signed. As alluded to\nabove, Either/Or contrasts the aesthetic picture of erotic\nlove as immediate immersion in the infatuation of \u201cfirst\nlove\u201d or hyper-reflective seduction (\u201clove\u201d as a\nkind of game) with married love as preserving love in time (living\nsimultaneously in \u201chope\u201d and \u201crecollection:\u201d\ndeveloping a shared history, properly related to a shared past and a\nshared future, and thus making love \u201chistorical\u201d.) For the\nJudge, such love may be made \u201ceternal\u201d by being freely\ntaken upon as one\u2019s duty. Related themes are also explored in\nStages on Life\u2019s Way. Fear and Trembling,\noften approached as being about a clash of duties (between\nAbraham\u2019s duty to his God and ethical duties conceived of in\nterms of \u201cthe universal\u201d), may just as well be approached\nas an apparent clash of loves (for God; for Isaac).\n\nHowever, Kierkegaard\u2019s most significant text on love is the\nsigned Works of Love, a series of fifteen\n\u201cdeliberations\u201d, typically on a key New Testament passage\non love. A central issue in this text is the love that is at stake in\nthe command to love our neighbors as ourselves. The form of love that\nfor Kierkegaard is at the root of all true love is\nKjerlighed, which in many of its uses can reasonably be\nunderstood as \u201cneighbor-love\u201d and as a form of\nagape\u2014provided we understand this as a quality that\nhuman beings are capable of manifesting (albeit with a divine source),\nnot just a quality of God himself. Several deliberations contrast\nneighbor-love with forms of \u201cpreferential\u201d love (erotic\nlove [Elskov] and friendship). Contrary to what has often\nbeen claimed (e.g., Adorno 1939 [2003], L\u00f8gstrup 1956 [1997]),\nKierkegaard is not opposed to erotic love and friendship, but\nconcerned about the risks inherent within them, chiefly the way in\nwhich they may often manifest \u201cselfish\u201d forms of\nself-love. The key difference between them and neighbor-love is that\nthe preferential loves arise \u201cnaturally\u201d for humans,\nwhereas neighbor-love does not. \u201cThe neighbor\u201d includes\neveryone, and we are to strive to love all\u2014including our\nenemies. This is so counter-intuitive to the \u201cnatural\u201d\nhuman, Kierkegaard claims, that it needs to be commanded (WL\n24\u20135, SKS 9, 32\u20133). Furthermore, the duty to love must be\ngrounded in divine authority; no human authority is sufficient.\nNeighbor-love\u2014in which God is the \u201cmiddle\nterm\u201d\u2014is often portrayed as a kind of purifying agent,\nwhich is capable of transforming otherwise potentially disordered\nkinds of love and preserving \u201cthe equality of the eternal\u201d\nin love. Precisely how has been a matter of recent scholarly\ncontroversy (for contributions, building on a dispute between Ferreira\n2001 and Krishek 2009, see for instance Lippitt 2013a, Davenport 2017,\nHanson 2022). Nevertheless, Kierkegaard stresses that love is still\ngenuine even when one needs to be loved: in this sense, his\nconception of love is very different from those who would draw a hard\nand fast distinction between, say, agape and eros\n(e.g., Nygren 1930\u201336 [1953]).\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s focus on the works (or deeds) of love is\nalso key. He does not approach love simply as an occurrent feeling,\nbut as a \u201cpassion\u201d, which for him is something like a\npowerful basic disposition that can give shape to a whole life,\nexpressing itself in actions as well as in emotions. Underlying this\npassion is a certain way of seeing: Kierkegaard\u2019s is a\n\u201cvision\u201d view of love (Ferreira 2001, esp. 99\u2013116).\nFar from being a generalized form of benevolence or compassion,\nneighbor-love requires paying attention to the particular\nneighbor we encounter, seeing the other in all her distinctive\nconcreteness and specificity, and desiring what is good for that\nindividual in particular. Relatedly, love has its own epistemic\nstandards rooted in a certain generosity of spirit, a recognition that\nunderpins important discussions on how attitudes of trust or mistrust;\nhope or despair, can help or hinder our interpretation of ambiguous\nevidence about people (cf. the deliberations \u201cLove Believes all\nThings\u2014and Yet Is Never Deceived\u201d and \u201cLove Hopes\nAll Things\u2014and Yet Is Never Put to Shame\u201d.) Another\nimportant theme\u2014at the heart of the second love\ncommandment\u2014is how we should love ourselves. The\ncommandment takes it as a given that we do: like others who have\nwritten on self-love (from Aristotle and Aquinas to Harry Frankfurt),\nKierkegaard is interested in \u201cproper\u201d and\n\u201cimproper\u201d ways of doing so. To love oneself\nproperly\u2014in a non-selfish way\u2014is not only allowed but\nrequired. The neighbor, remember, includes everyone\u2014and everyone\nincludes you. An appropriate kind of hope for and trust in oneself,\nplus self- forgiveness, properly understood, may be taken to be\nimportant modes of proper self-love (Lippitt 2013a: 136\u201380).\n3.3.3 Hope and Other Virtues\n\nDespair\u2014discussed in\n \u00a72,\n \u00a73.1, and\n \u00a73.2\n above\u2014has long been recognized as a key Kierkegaardian theme.\nAlong with anxiety, it remains one of Kierkegaard\u2019s key\npsychological-religious concepts. Hope\u2014which Kierkegaard most\ncommonly discusses under the name of \u201cexpectancy\u201d\n(Forventning)\u2014may be seen as despair\u2019s\nantithesis. Indeed, it has been argued that despair is at root the\nunwillingness to hope, and that hope is essential to the task of\nbecoming a self (Bernier 2015, cf. Lippitt 2015a). On such a view,\nfaith contrasts with despair because faith includes a willingness to\nhope.\n\nIn the discourse literature, Kierkegaard explores the structure of\nvarious other virtues of the ethical\nand\u2014particularly\u2014religious life. Aside from extensive\ndiscussions of faith and love, he also explores hope, courage,\nhumility, patience, honesty, gratitude and meekness\n(Sagtmodighed), amongst others. There are also extensive\ndiscussions of such qualities as joy and contrition, and peculiarly\nKierkegaardian qualities such as (spiritual) sobriety and\n\u201cearnestness\u201d (Alvor). The philosophical task of\nunpacking these qualities is almost always in the service of the role\nthey play in the religious or specifically Christian life. While\nKierkegaard\u2019s approach to these qualities is often not\nexplicitly to talk of them as virtues (perhaps because of the negative\nresonances of talk of \u201cvirtue\u201d in his native Lutheran\ntradition\u2014but see Vos 2020), it makes sense to do so given that\neach may be thought of as contributing to the formation of character.\nBroadly in line with the classical tradition, he typically sees each\nsuch quality as involving certain ways of thinking, feeling and seeing\ncorrectly. One significant difference with the classical Greek\ntradition, however, is that Kierkegaard holds, along with many other\nChristian thinkers, that some of these human excellences cannot be\nachieved merely through human willing but require divine grace and\nassistance. There is a growing recognition of Kierkegaard as being a\nlargely untapped source of insight into understanding the role of\nnumerous virtues in the task of allowing oneself to be \u201cbuilt\nup\u201d. (See, e.g., Lippitt 2020, Roberts 2022: for a contrary\nview, skeptical about associating Kierkegaard with the virtue\ntradition, see Walsh 2018.)\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s theological concerns often influence what he says\nabout human character. One example illustrating this is his view of\nforgiveness. While forgiveness is not (unlike say anxiety or despair)\na topic to which he devotes an entire book, it is a theme that emerges\nin many places in the authorship. Although Kierkegaard\u2019s\ninterest seems to be in what it means to be a forgiving\nperson (an aspect of what it means to be a loving\nperson), the primary lens through which he views forgiveness is the\ndivine forgiveness of sins. This means that he is as interested in the\ndifficulty of our accepting forgiveness as the difficulty of\nour being able to forgive. To accept forgiveness requires\n\u201csin-consciousness:\u201d an awareness of oneself as being in\nthe wrong. For Kierkegaard, this is extremely difficult for such\nprideful creatures as we are. The capacity to forgive sin per\nse (as opposed to individual wrongs) is the \u201cchasmal\nqualitative abyss\u201d (SUD 122/SKS 11, 233) between God and\nhumanity. The refusal of God\u2019s forgiveness is itself a\nmanifestation of pride, rooted in a misguided sense of our\nself-sufficiency and a failure to recognize our radical dependency. In\nThe Sickness Unto Death, Anti-Climacus claims that the\ndespair of the forgiveness of sins is itself a sin\n(\u201coffense\u201d,) which can only be transcended in faith. This\ntheological background plays an important role in what Kierkegaard\ngoes on to claim about self-forgiveness and interpersonal forgiveness\n(such as the need to avoid such vices as pride and self-righteousness,\nand the need to cultivate \u201cbefore God\u201d such capacities as\ngenerosity of spirit, humility and hope). His fundamental approach to\nthese forms of human forgiveness, as well as the divine forgiveness in\nwhich they have their origins, is to explore them as \u201cworks of\nlove\u201d (see Lippitt 2020).\n4. Trajectories in Kierkegaard Scholarship\n\nThe vast range of Kierkegaard\u2019s influences makes the task of\nsummarizing the most important secondary literature close to\nimpossible. For the literature selected would depend upon which\napproaches to Kierkegaard the author finds most fruitful. In this\nsection, we aim to sketch some key trajectories of interpretation,\ngiving sample references of each kind of approach.\n\nOne axis along which Kierkegaard commentators may be divided is\nbetween those for whom the primary task in understanding Kierkegaard\ninvolves locating him accurately in his historical context (e.g.,\nunderstanding his complex relationship to German idealism and\nromanticism, and to contemporaries such as the Danish Hegelian Hans\nLassen Martensen), and those for whom Kierkegaard is interesting\nprimarily because of the ability his texts have to contribute to\nissues of more recent or contemporary interest (philosophical;\ntheological; literary; social or political; etc.). An excellent\nexample of the former approach would be much of the work of Jon\nStewart. For many years, Niels Thulstrup\u2019s\nKierkegaard\u2019s Relation to Hegel (1967 [1980]) was\nthought to have decisively shown that Kierkegaard took little from\nHegel. However, Stewart\u2019s Kierkegaard\u2019s Relations to\nHegel Reconsidered (2003)\u2014note the plural in the\ntitle\u2014argues convincingly that many of the targets Kierkegaard\nhad in mind in his attacks on Hegelianism were Danish followers of\nHegel who may have misunderstood or misapplied Hegel in significant\nways. Thus, Kierkegaard\u2019s relation to Hegel is much more complex\nand nuanced than has sometimes been thought. Stewart aims to show that\nKierkegaard was responding specifically to debates in 1830s and 1840s\nDenmark about Hegel\u2019s philosophy (especially its significance\nfor theology), a milieu in which Martensen was a crucial\nfigure.\n\nThis does not mean, nor does Stewart claim, that there are no\ndisagreements between Kierkegaard and Hegel. Stewart divides the\nKierkegaard corpus into three main periods: up to and including\nEither/Or (where Kierkegaard is most open to Hegel\u2019s\nphilosophy); from Fear and Trembling to the\nPostscript (where the attacks on \u201cHegelianism\u201d\nare most pronounced and polemical); and Works of Love\nonwards, where the waning of Hegel\u2019s influence in Denmark means\nthat Kierkegaard\u2019s criticism diminishes. Here a certain positive\ninfluence of Hegel re-emerges, for example in the method of The\nSickness Unto Death.\n\nCritics have disagreed as to whether Stewart\u2019s analysis closes\nthe gap between Kierkegaard and Hegel excessively, for instance\nregarding the two figures\u2019 different views of the relationship\nbetween philosophy and religion. One central issue concerns the proper\nattitude of the philosopher. As we have noted, Kierkegaard opposes a\nkind of disengaged \u201cobjective\u201d standpoint, while Hegel at\nleast in some places maintains that such an attitude is necessary for\nphilosophy to be \u201cscientific\u201d. Hegel famously claims that\n\u201cphilosophy should beware of the wish to be edifying\u201d\n(Hegel 1977: 6; originally published 1807), which seems directly\ncontrary to the Kierkegaardian claim at the end of Either/Or\nII: \u201cOnly the truth that edifies is truth for you\u201d\n(EO II, 354, translation modified/ SKS 3,331). Another point of\ntension is the Hegelian aim to produce a \u201csystem\u201d\nencompassing the whole of reality, whereas Kierkegaard\u2019s\npseudonym Johannes Climacus insists that a system of existence is\nimpossible for anyone but God (CUP I, 118\u2013125/SKS 7, 114\n-120).\n\nStewart later went on to become general editor of a monumental series:\nKierkegaard Research: Sources, Reception, and Resources,\nwhich includes a huge amount of work of this historically oriented\ntype (amongst others). Michelle Kosch\u2019s work on Kierkegaard in\nrelation to German idealism (Kosch 2006) is another exemplary instance\nof historically oriented work, while Fred Rush\u2019s book on\nKierkegaard in relation to romanticism (esp. Schlegel) and idealism\n(esp. Hegel) also provides helpful historical context (Rush 2016).\n\nExamples of the less historically oriented type of Kierkegaard\nscholarship are highly varied. Some have looked to Kierkegaard as a\nkind of proto-Derrida, a deconstructionist avant la lettre\n(e.g., Poole 1993; for an overview of deconstructionist and\npostmodernist readings of Kierkegaard which does not conflate the two,\nsee Shakespeare 2013). Similarly, the question has been raised as to\nwhether Kierkegaard can plausibly be read as a proto-phenomenologist\ndespite preceding Husserl (e.g., Hanson 2010; see also Welz 2013).\nOthers have seen some intriguing commonalities between Kierkegaard and\nWittgenstein, either the Tractatus or later writings,\nsometimes focusing on the ostensibly narrow but (it is claimed)\nultimately deeply significant question of how we should read the\n\u201crevocation\u201d of the Postscript, and what this\nreveals about the proper method of philosophy with regard to religious\nquestions (e.g., Cavell 1969; Conant 1989, 1993, 1995; Lippitt &\nHutto 1998; Phillips 1999; Mulhall 2001; Sch\u00f6nbaumsfeld 2007).\nMacIntyre\u2019s claims about Kierkegaard\u2019s proper place in the\nhistory of philosophy\u2014allegedly, as a critical figure in the\nfailure of the Enlightenment\u2019s attempt to offer a rational\njustification of morality\u2014spawned a veritable scholarly\nsub-industry, not only aiming to show where MacIntyre was wrong in his\ninterpretation of Kierkegaard, but of how Kierkegaard in fact\nanticipated many highly MacIntyrean themes. As noted above, a central\nfocus of debate has been whether Kierkegaard may be read\u2014like\nMacIntyre\u2014as a proponent of a narrative-based account of\npractical identity, where a \u201cnarrative structure\u201d is\nneeded to make a human life intelligible, actions and intentions\nneeding to be located in a temporal, social and teleological context\nin order to be understood. However, this may be seen as part of a\nbroader school of interpretation, which finds some intriguing\nparallels between Kierkegaard and several major recent anglophone\nmoral philosophers. Besides MacIntyre, these would include Harry\nFrankfurt (see, e.g., Mooney 1996, esp. 65\u201376 and the essays in\nRudd and Davenport 2015); Iris Murdoch (e.g., Martens 2012); Charles\nTaylor (e.g., Khan 2012) and Bernard Williams (e.g., Mooney 1996, esp.\n65\u201376, Compaijen 2018). The shift in moral philosophy during the\nlater decades of the twentieth century and into the\ntwenty-first\u2014from mid-1900s concerns about the nature of ethical\nlanguage and debates about realism versus anti-realism in ethics, to\nbroader concerns about what makes human lives meaningful, the nature\nof human flourishing, and the moral psychology of the\nvirtues\u2014has been seen by many Kierkegaard scholars as a move\n(albeit mostly an unwitting one) in the direction of more\n\u201cKierkegaardian\u201d concerns. Within this school of\ninterpretation, some key claims have been that Kierkegaard holds a\nteleological view of the self; a belief that the quest for\n\u201cnarrative unity\u201d is an important element in achieving\nethical selfhood; and a rich view of the virtues (Davenport and Rudd\n2001; Davenport 2012; Rudd 2012). Even skeptics about the second view\n(e.g., Lippitt 2007, 2015b) have tended to agree on the first and\nthird.\n\nAnother major fault line in Kierkegaard scholarship concerns the\ndivide between scholars who take Kierkegaard\u2019s Christian\ncommitments seriously and those who find them something of an\nembarrassment, and whose approach to the texts seems to be to ask what\ncan be salvaged despite these commitments. The former approach is\nexemplified in much of the work of Evans (1983, 1992, 2009, 2019),\nwhich has consistently tried to show that Kierkegaard\u2019s writings\ncan be helpful in making sense of the religious life in general and\nChristianity in particular. The latter type of work has sometimes\ntaken the form of reading Kierkegaard \u201cagainst\nKierkegaard\u201d (e.g., Adorno 1933 [1989], Theunissen 1993 [2005]).\nFinally, quite a bit of work has also been done on Kierkegaard\u2019s\nview of women and gender (see for instance Walsh 2022.)\n5. Conclusion\n\nKierkegaard is a beguiling but frustrating thinker, full of\nprovocations and insights but also difficult to nail down. He has thus\nbeen interpreted in many\u2014often incompatible\u2014ways, and this\nis likely to continue to be so. Much of his thought remains highly\nrelevant to our day, including his critique of mass society and\nconformism, and his attempt to show emotions and passions as essential\nelements of authentic human life. In his writings on ethical and\nreligious life, he tries to show that a disengaged, objective stance,\nfar from facilitating knowledge, is a barrier to knowing the truth.\nHis perspective on religion and society is likely to elicit objections\nfrom opposite sides of the contemporary political spectrum, since he\nsharply criticizes \u201cChristendom\u201d, including contemporary\nversions of Christian nationalism (see, e.g., Backhouse 2011), while\nalso rejecting the claim of some liberals that religion should be\nexcluded from our common life, which requires a supposedly neutral,\ndisengaged stance that Kierkegaard sees as neither possible nor\ndesirable. If the\n\u201canalytic\u201d\u2014\u201ccontinental\u201d distinction\nstill has any value, then Kierkegaard has appealed to philosophers on\nboth sides, sometimes providing fine conceptual analyses yet also\ndoing philosophy in a highly literary mode. He himself can be seen as\n\u201cthat individual\u201d to whom he dedicated many of his works,\na writer who succeeded in his goal of communicating\n\u201cindirectly\u201d, in a manner that demands\n\u201csubjective\u201d engagement if his work is to be read to\nmaximum advantage.\nChronology of Kierkegaard\u2019s Works\n\n1838\n\n\nFrom the Papers of One Still Living.
