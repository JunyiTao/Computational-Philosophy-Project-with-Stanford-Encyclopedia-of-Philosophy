    "main_text": "The Rejection of Special Metaphysics and the Transcendental Dialectic || Hypostatization and Subreption\n2.2 Hypostatization and Subreption\n\nThere are two noteworthy themes implicit in Kant\u2019s criticism of\nmetaphysics. First, Kant offers an account and critique of the ideas\nof reason specific to each discipline. In relation to this, the\ngeneral theory of reason plays a role in Kant\u2019s efforts to argue\nagainst the \u201chypostatization\u201d of each of the ideas. More\nspecifically, Kant\u2019s criticism of the metaphysical disciplines\ncenters on his efforts to show that the ideas of reason (the soul, the\nworld and God), which are thought in accordance with the demand for an\nunconditioned that could unify the relevant domain of conditions, get\nerroneously \u201chypostatized\u201d by reason, or thought as\nmind-independent \u201cobjects\u201d about which we might seek\nknowledge. In the same way, that is, that the prescription to seek the\nunconditioned appears to reason as an objective principle, so too, the\nsubjective ideas appear to reason as objects existing in a\nmind-independent way. Kant\u2019s aim is to secure the subjective\nideas while enforcing their subjective status, and thereby defusing\nthe metaphysics that attends to them.\n\nThus, Kant\u2019s criticism of metaphysics simultaneously involves\ndenying the pure use of theoretical reason as an instrument for\nknowledge of transcendent objects, and defending\nreason\u2019s ideas as projections or goals that have some\nsignificant role to play in the overall project of knowledge\nacquisition. As we shall see, Kant unfortunately is not as clear as we\nmight like on this issue. Sometimes, he seems to argue that the ideas\nand principles of reason play a merely heuristic role in guiding and\nsystematizing the knowledge already obtained. Other times, he suggests\nthat these ideas are deeply essential to the project of knowledge\nacquisition, and that their presupposition is utterly necessary if we\nare to acquire knowledge. Regardless of how the matter is to be\nresolved, it is clear that Kant\u2019s criticism of metaphysics does\nnot entail any straightforward rejection of the ideas and principles\nof reason. Indeed, it appears to be precisely the rational constraint\nto move to the ideas of reason that binds us to our metaphysical\npropensities and which thus demands a critique of the kind offered by\nKant.\n\nIn addition to criticizing the \u201chypostatization\u201d of the\nideas of reason, Kant seeks to expose the \u201csubreptions\u201d\ninvolved in the use of the ideas. The term \u201csubreption\u201d\nrefers to a fallacy that specifically involves the surreptitious\nsubstitution of different kinds of terms and concepts. Kant\nusually uses the term to refer to the error of confusing or\nsubstituting concepts and principles meant for use in experience\n(those which properly apply to appearances) with principles of\n\u201cpure reason.\u201d By this means, a concept or principle which\nis a condition of our experience (e.g., the principle of apperception)\nis used in a way that assumes its applications to \u201cobjects in\ngeneral\u201d or things in themselves. Alternatively, a most general,\nformal, principle that would only hold for things in general is taken,\nby itself alone, to yield knowledge about appearances. This second\nkind of criticism found throughout the Dialectic thus pertains to\nKant\u2019s efforts to expose the subreptions that ground the\nillusory metaphysical arguments. Ultimately, Kant will also\nseek to reveal the very specific formal fallacies that vitiate the\nmetaphysical arguments, to demonstrate that (although they have the\nappearance of soundness) the positions in each case are implicitly\ngrounded in, or deploy, dialectical uses of terms and concepts,\nmisapplications of principles, and conflations of appearances with\nthings in themselves. What we find in Kant\u2019s criticism of\nmetaphysics, in other words, is a complex account, one grounded in a\nfairly robust theory of human reason. Accordingly, he identifies\nreason as the locus of certain principles and propensities, and\ncertain \u201cillusions,\u201d which cooperate with misapplications\nof concepts and principles to create the errors already exposed in the\nTranscendental Analytic. Although this variety of aims and complaints\ncertainly complicates Kant\u2019s discussions in the Dialectic, it\nalso makes for a richer and more penetrating criticism of\nmetaphysics.\n",
