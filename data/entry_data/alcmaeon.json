    "preamble": "\n\nAlcmaeon of Croton was an early Greek medical writer and\nphilosopher-scientist. His exact date, his relationship to other early\nGreek philosopher-scientists, and whether he was primarily a medical\nwriter/physician or a typical Presocratic cosmologist, are all matters\nof controversy. He is likely to have written his book sometime between\n500 and 450 BCE. The surviving fragments and testimonia focus\nprimarily on issues of physiology, psychology, and epistemology and\nreveal Alcmaeon to be a thinker of considerable originality. He was\nthe first to identify the brain as the seat of understanding and to\ndistinguish understanding from perception. Alcmaeon thought that the\nsensory organs were connected to the brain by channels\n(poroi) and may have discovered the poroi connecting\nthe eyes to the brain (i.e. the optic nerve) by excising the eyeball\nof an animal, although it is doubtful that he used dissection as a\nstandard method. He was the first to develop an argument for the\nimmortality of the soul. He used a political metaphor to define health\nand disease: The equality (isonomia) of the opposing powers\nwhich make up the body (e.g., the wet, the dry, the hot, the cold, the\nsweet, the bitter etc.) preserves health, whereas the monarchy of any\none of them produces disease. Alcmaeon discussed a wide range of\ntopics in physiology including sleep, death, and the development of\nthe embryo. It is unclear whether he also presented a cosmology in\nterms of opposing powers, but we do have some testimonia concerning\nhis views on astronomy. Alcmaeon had considerable impact on his\nsuccessors in the Greek philosophical tradition. Aristotle wrote a\ntreatise responding to him, Plato may have been influenced by his\nargument for the immortality of the soul, and both Plato and Philolaus\naccepted his view that the brain is the seat of intelligence.\n",

    "main_text": "\nLife and Works\n1.1 Medical Writer or Philosopher?\n\nAlcmaeon, son of Peirithous (otherwise unknown), lived in the Greek\ncity of Croton on the instep of the boot of Italy. Diogenes Laertius,\nin his brief life of Alcmaeon (VIII. 83), asserts that he wrote mostly\non medical matters. There is, however, little direct evidence for his\nwork as a practicing physician. Later writers in the medical\ntradition, such as Galen (DK A2), treat him as a philosopher-scientist\nrather than as a physician, so that some scholars (Mansfeld 1975; cf.\nPerilli 2001 for a critique) have concluded that he was not a doctor\nat all but rather a typical Presocratic physiologos (writer\non nature). The majority of scholars, however, because of\nDiogenes\u2019 remark and because of the focus on the functioning of\nthe human body in the testimonia and fragments, refer to Alcmaeon as a\nphysician-philosopher. The historian Herodotus tells us that, in the\nsecond half of the sixth century, the physicians of Croton were the\nbest in the Greek world (III. 131) and recounts in some detail the\nactivities of the most prominent Crotoniate physician of the time,\nDemocedes (III. 125\u2013138). Thus, whether a practicing physician\nor not, Alcmaeon undoubtedly owes some of his interest in human\nphysiology and psychology to the medical tradition in Croton. In the\nfifth century, it is difficult to draw clear lines between the work of\na medical writer/physician and a philosopher/scientist. Presocratic\ncosmologies of this period devoted some attention to questions of\nhuman physiology and medicine, and conversely the early treatises in\nthe Hippocratic corpus often paid some attention to cosmology (see\nAristotle, Resp. 480b23 ff.). The earliest Presocratic\ncosmologies in Ionia (e.g., those of Anaximander and Anaximenes) did\nnot deal with physiology, and it is possible that the new interest in\nphysiology in cosmologies of the fifth century (e.g., those of\nEmpedocles and Anaxagoras) was due to the influence of Alcmaeon (Zhmud\n2012a, 366; 2014, 100).\n1.2 Was Alcmaeon a Pythagorean?\n\nCroton is also famous as the center of Pythagoras\u2019 activity from\nca. 530, when he left Samos. Alcmaeon addressed his book to three men\nwho may have been Pythagoreans:\n\nAlcmaeon of Croton, son of Peirithous, said the following to Brotinus,\nLeon, and Bathyllus\u2026 (DK, B1)\n\n\nWe know nothing of Leon and Bathyllus, except that Iamblichus, in\nOn the Pythagorean Way of Life (=VP), lists a\nPythagorean named Leon from Metapontum and a Pythagorean Bathylaus\nfrom Poseidonia (Paestum), both Greek cities of southern Italy\n(VP 267). Bro(n)tinus is identified as a Pythagorean from\nCroton in some places (D.L. VIII. 42; Iamb. VP 132) and from\nMetapontum in others (VP 194, 267). He is either the father\nor the husband of Theano, who is in turn either the wife or student of\nPythagoras. Does this \u201cdedication\u201d of his book to\nPythagoreans indicate that Alcmaeon himself was a Pythagorean? Even if\nthis is a dedication, it does not follow that Alcmaeon agreed with the\nviews of his addressees. Comparison with Empedocles\u2019 address to\nPausanias suggests, moreover, that what we have is not a dedication\nbut an exhortation or an attempt to instruct (Vlastos 1953, 344, n.\n25). Comparison with other early Greek prose writers such as Hecataeus\nand Heraclitus shows that books could begin with criticism of the\nviews of others so that Alcmaeon\u2019s address to these Pythagoreans\nmay be polemical (Kouloumentas 2018).\n\nDiogenes Laertius, in his Lives of the Philosophers\n(3rd century AD), includes Alcmaeon among the Pythagoreans\nand says that he studied with Pythagoras (VIII. 83). Later authors\nsuch as Iamblichus (VP 104, 267), Philoponus (De An.\np. 88), and the scholiast on Plato (Alc. 121e) also call\nAlcmaeon a Pythagorean. A majority of scholars up to the middle of the\ntwentieth century followed this tradition. However, it is not true\nthat the ancient \u201ctradition is unanimous in presenting him as a\nPythagorean\u201d (Zhmud 2012a, 123). In fact, the majority of\nancient sources do not describe him as a Pythagorean (e.g., Clement\n[DK 24A2], Galen [DK24A2], Aetius [DK 24A4, 6, 8\u201310, 13,\n17\u201318], Censorinus [DK 24A13\u201314], and Chalcidius [DK\nA10]). The best argument for regarding him as Pythagorean would be his\ninclusion in Iamblichus\u2019 catalogue of Pythagoreans at the end of\nhis On the Pythagorean Life, if we could be sure that all\nparts of that catalogue go back to Aristoxenus in the fourth century,\nsince Aristoxenus is a very knowledgeable source on Pythagoreanism\n(Zhmud 2012a, 122; 2012b, 241\u201343). However, certain parts of the\ncatalogue are very unlikely go back to Aristoxenus and we cannot be\ncertain that the inclusion of Alcmaeon was due to him (Huffman 2005,\n297\u201399). Apart from this possibility regarding Aristoxenus, no\none earlier than Diogenes Laertius (ca. 200 AD) calls Alcmaeon a\nPythagorean. Aristotle wrote two books on the Pythagoreans but wrote a\nseparate book on Alcmaeon. Aristotle and Theophrastus refer to him a\nnumber of times but never identify him as a Pythagorean, and this is\nthe practice of the doxographical tradition (see A4, 6, 8\u201310,\n13\u201314, 17\u201318, in DK 24). Simplicius\n(6th AD) reports that some have handed down the view that\nAlcmaeon is a Pythagorean but notes that Aristotle denies it (De\nAn. 32.3). Most telling is Aristotle\u2019s discussion of\nAlcmaeon in Metaphysics book I (986a22 ff.). He notes a\nsimilarity between Alcmaeon and a group of Pythagoreans in positing\nopposites as the principles of things but expresses uncertainty as to\nwho influenced whom. Earlier scholars took this comparison of Alcmaeon\nto the Pythagoreans as confirmation that he was a Pythagorean. Most\nscholars of the last fifty years, however, have come to recognize that\nAristotle\u2019s treatment of Alcmaeon here suggests the exact\nopposite; it only makes sense to compare him with the Pythagoreans and\nwonder who influenced whom, if he is not a Pythagorean (e.g., Guthrie\n1962, 341: \u201cAristotle \u2026 expressly distinguishes him from\nthe Pythagoreans\u201d). Certainly most of the opposites which are\nmentioned as crucial to Alcmaeon do not appear in the Pythagorean\ntable of opposites, and there is no trace of the crucial Pythagorean\nopposition between limit and unlimited in Alcmaeon. The overwhelming\nmajority of scholars since 1950 have accordingly regarded Alcmaeon as\na figure independent of the Pythagoreans (e.g., Guthrie 1962, 341;\nBurkert 1972, 289; KRS 1983, 339; Lloyd 1991, 167; Kahn 2001; Riedweg\n2005, 115; Primavesi 2012, 447. Zhmud [2012a, 121\u2013124; 2014,\n97\u2013102] is the notable exception), although, as a fellow citizen\nof Croton, he will have been familiar with their thought.\n1.3 Date\n\nNo issue concerning Alcmaeon has been more controversial than his\ndate. Some have sought to date him on the basis of his address to\nBrotinus (e.g., Zhmud 2012a, 122). Brotinus\u2019 dates are too\nuncertain to be of much help, however. If he is Theano\u2019s father\nand Theano was Pythagoras\u2019 wife, he could be a contemporary of\nPythagoras (570\u2013490) or even older. If he is Theano\u2019s\nhusband and she was a student of Pythagoras in his old age and thus\ntwenty in 490, Brotinus could have been born as late as 520. This\nsuggests that Brotinus could have been the addressee of the book any\ntime between 550 and 450 BCE. The center of controversy, however, has\nbeen a sentence in the passage of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics discussed above:\n\nAlcmaeon of Croton also seems to have thought along similar lines, and\neither he took this theory over from them [i.e. the Pythagoreans] or\nthey from him. For in age Alcmaeon was in the old age of\nPythagoras, and his views were similar to theirs\n(986a27\u201331).\n\n\nThe sentence in bold above is missing in one of the major manuscripts\nand Alexander makes no mention of it in his commentary on the\nMetaphysics. It does appear in the other two major\nmanuscripts and in Asclepius\u2019 commentary. A number of scholars\nhave regarded it as a remark by a later commentator, which has crept\ninto the text (e.g., Ross 1924, 152; Burkert 1972, 29, n.60) and this\nis the view of the most recent editor (Primavesi 2012, 447\u20138).\nIt is a surprising remark for Aristotle to make, since he only refers\nto Pythagoras once elsewhere in all his extant writings and throughout\nthis passage of the Metaphysics refers to the Pythagoreans or\nItalians in the plural. Other scholars regard the remark as genuine\n(e.g., Wachtler 1896; Guthrie 1962, 341\u20133; Zhmud 2012a, 122).\nEven if we accept the remark as genuine, the assertion that Alcmaeon\n\u201cwas\u201d (egeneto) in the old age of Pythagoras is\nambiguous. Does it mean that Alcmaeon was born in the old age of\nPythagoras, or that he lived (flourished?) in the old age of\nPythagoras? Diels emended the sentence to say that Alcmaeon was\n\u201cyoung\u201d in the old age of Pythagoras and this emendation\nis supported by a similar remark found in Iamblichus (VP\n104). Although Diels accepted the text as Aristotelian, others have\nseen the parallel with Iamblichus as evidence that it is a remark by a\nlater commentator and have pointed out that the report in Iamblichus\ninvolves several chronological impossibilities (e.g., that Philolaus\nwas young in the old age of Pythagoras). Moreover, Diels\u2019 text\nsuggests that the purpose of the remark was to show Alcmaeon\u2019s\ndependence on Pythagoras, which would show that the remark cannot be\ndue to Aristotle, who has just distinguished Alcmaeon from the\nPythagoreans and expressed doubts as to who influenced whom (Primavesi\n2012, 447\u20138). Even if the remark is unlikely to go back to\nAristotle, his doubts about who influenced whom suggest that Alcmaeon\nbelonged to the late sixth or early fifth century (Schofield 2012,\n156), which would argue against the late date of 440 adopted by\nMansfeld (2013, 78, n. 1). One group of scholars thus dates the\npublication of Alcmaeon\u2019s book to around 500 (Burkert 1972, 292;\nKirk, Raven, Schofield 1983, 339 [early 5th]; Zhmud 2012a,\n122 [not later than 490]) so that he would have been born around 540.\nAnother group has him born around 510 so that his book would have been\npublished in 470 or later (Guthrie 1962, 358 [480\u2013440 BCE];\nLloyd 1991, 168 [490\u2013430 BCE]). In either case Alcmaeon probably\nwrote before Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and Philolaus. He is either the\ncontemporary or the predecessor of Parmenides. Attempts to date him on\nthe basis of internal evidence alone, i.e. comparison of his doctrines\nwith those of other thinkers, have led to the widest divergence of\ndates. Edelstein says that he may have lived in the late fifth century\n(1942, 372), while Lebedev makes him active in the late 6th\n(1993).\n1.4 Alcmaeon\u2019s Book and the Evidence for Its Contents\n\nThe ancient tradition assigns one book to Alcmaeon, which came to bear\nthe traditional title of Presocratic treatises, On Nature\n(DK, A2), although this title probably does not go back to Alcmaeon\nhimself. Favorinus\u2019 report that Alcmaeon was the first to write\nsuch a treatise (DK, A1) is almost certainly wrong, since Anaximander\nwrote before Alcmaeon. Theophrastus\u2019 detailed report of\nAlcmaeon\u2019s account of the senses (DK, A5) and the fact that\nAristotle wrote a treatise in response to Alcmaeon (D.L. V. 25)\nsuggest that the book was available in the fourth century BCE. It is\nunclear whether Alcmaeon wrote in the Doric dialect of Croton or in\nthe Ionic Greek of the first Presocratics (Burkert, 1972, 222, n. 21).\nThe report that an Alcimon of Croton was the first to write animal\nfables might be a reference to a poet of a similar name. Fragment 5 in\nDK (\u201cIt is easier to be on one\u2019s guard against an enemy\nthan a friend.\u201d) sounds very much like the moral of such a fable\n(Gomperz 1953, 64\u20135). Diels and Kranz (=DK) identify five other\nfragments of Alcmaeon (Frs. 1, 1a, 2, 3, 4) and arrange the testimonia\nunder 18 headings. Fragments 1a, 3 and 4, however, are really\ntestimonia which use language of a later date, although some of\nAlcmaeon\u2019s terminology is embedded in them. The three lines of\nFragment 1, which probably began the book, and the half line in\nFragment 2 are the only continuous texts of Alcmaeon. Another brief\nfragment/testimonium should be added to the material in DK: \u201cthe\nearth is the mother of plants and the sun their father\u201d\n(Nicolaus Damascenus, De plantis I 2.44; see Kirk 1956 and\nLebedev 1993). There is also the possibility that Fr. 125 of the\nSpartan poet Alcman (\u201cExperience is the beginning of\nlearning.\u201d) should, in fact, be assigned to Alcmaeon (Lanza\n1965; Barnes 1982, 610).\n2. Epistemology and Psychology\n2.1 The Limits of Knowledge\n\nAlcmaeon began his book by defining the limits of human knowledge:\n\nConcerning things that are not perceptible [concerning mortal things]\nthe gods have clarity, but insofar as it is possible for human beings\nto judge (tekmairesthai) \u2026 (DK, B1)\n\n\nSuch skepticism about human knowledge is characteristic of one strand\nof early Greek thought. Both Alcmaeon\u2019s predecessors (e.g.,\nXenophanes B34) and his successors (e.g., Philolaus B6) made similar\ncontrasts between divine and human knowledge, but in Alcmaeon\u2019s\ncase, as in these other cases, we do not have enough evidence to be\nsure what he intended. Most of the subjects that Alcmaeon went on to\ndiscuss in his book could not be settled by a direct appeal to sense\nperception (e.g., the functioning of the senses, the balance of\nopposites in the healthy body, the immortality of the soul). In this\nsense he was dealing largely with what is \u201cnot\nperceptible\u201d (aphanes). Alcmaeon is decidedly not an\nextreme skeptic, however, in that he is willing to assign clear\nunderstanding about such things to the gods and by implication admits\nthat even humans have clear understanding of what is directly\nperceptible. Moreover, while humans cannot attain clarity about what\ncannot be perceived, Alcmaeon thinks that they can make reasonable\njudgments from the signs that are presented to them by sensation\n(tekmairesthai). He thus takes the stance of the scientist\nwho draws inferences from what can be perceived, and he implicitly\nrejects the claims of those who base their account of the world on the\ncertainty of a divine revelation (e.g., Pythagoras, Parmenides\nB1).\n\nThere are difficulties with the text of Fr. 1, which make its\ninterpretation problematic. Some scholars exclude the material in\nbrackets above because it is hard to see how to connect it to what\nprecedes (e.g., Wachtler 1896), while others keep the material and\nsuppose that we are to understand an \u201cand\u201d coordinating\nthe phrase in brackets with what precedes it (e.g., DK 1952). Other\nscholars would place a semicolon or colon after \u201cthings that are\nnot perceptible\u201d so that up to the colon Alcmaeon is identifying\nhis topic or the area of disagreement with this addressees, while\nafter the colon he begins his own account (Kouloumentas 2018 following\nGomperz). Gemelli Marciano (2007, 18\u201322), on the other hand, has\nsuggested that the material in brackets above should be kept but made\ndependent on the immediately preceding phrase rather than coordinated\nwith it, so that the fragment would read:\n\nConcerning things that are not perceptible concerning mortals the gods\nhave clarity, but insofar as it is possible for human beings to judge\n\u2026 (DK, B1)\n\n\nIf we regard Alcmaeon as primarily a doctor or medical thinker, rather\nthan as a cosmologist, \u201cthings that are not perceptible\nconcerning mortals\u201d is likely to refer to the interior of the\nbody and hidden diseases. Passages in the Greek medical writings of\nthe fifth century provide clear parallels for the difficulty of\nknowing about the interior of the body and invisible maladies (Gemelli\nMarciano 2007, 20\u201321). On this reading Fr.1 is addressed to\nmedical students. Parallels with medical treatises suggest that, after\nfirst raising difficulties about medical knowledge in these matters,\nAlcmaeon may have gone on to assert that these difficulties can be\novercome with the proper teaching, the teaching that followed in his\nbook. If this is the correct context in which to read the fragment, it\nis not so much about the limits of understanding as the success of\nmedical teaching in overcoming apparent limits.\n2.2 Understanding and Empiricism\n\nAccording to Theophrastus, Alcmaeon was the first Greek thinker to\ndistinguish between sense perception and understanding and to use this\ndistinction to separate animals, which only have sense perception,\nfrom humans, who have both sense perception and understanding (DK,\nB1a, A5). Alcmaeon is also the first to argue that the brain is the\ncentral organ of sensation and thought (DK, A5, A8, A10). There is no\nexplicit evidence, however, as to what Alcmaeon meant by\nunderstanding. The word translated as understanding here is\nsuni\u00eami, which in its earliest uses means \u201cto\nbring together,\u201d so that it is possible that Alcmaeon simply\nmeant that humans are able to bring the information provided by the\nsenses together in a way that animals cannot (Solmsen 1961, 151).\nAnimals have brains too, however, and thus might appear to be able to\ncarry out the simple correlation of the evidence from the various\nsenses, whereas the human ability to make inferences and judgments\n(DK, B1) appears to be a more plausible candidate for the distinctive\nactivity of human intelligence. It is possible that we should use a\npassage in Plato\u2019s Phaedo (96a-b = A11) to explicate\nfurther Alcmaeon\u2019s epistemology. The passage is part of\nSocrates\u2019 report of his early infatuation with natural science\nand with questions such as whether it is the blood, or air, or fire\nwith which we think. He also reports the view that it is the brain\nthat furnishes the sensations of hearing, sight, and smell. This\ncorresponds very well with Alcmaeon\u2019s view of the brain as the\ncentral sensory organ and, although Alcmaeon is not mentioned by name,\nmany scholars think that Plato must be referring to him here. Socrates\nconnects this view of the brain with an empiricist epistemology, which\nAristotle will later adopt (Posterior Analytics 100a3 ff.).\nThis epistemology involves three steps: first, the brain provides the\nsensations of hearing, sight and smell, then, memory and opinion arise\nfrom these, and finally, when memory and opinion achieve fixity,\nknowledge arises. Some scholars suppose that this entire epistemology\nis Alcmaeon\u2019s (e.g., Barnes 1982, 149 ff.), while others more\ncautiously note that we only have explicit evidence that Alcmaeon took\nthe first step (e.g., Vlastos 1970, 47, n.8).\n2.3 Did Alcmaeon Practice Dissection?\n\nAlcmaeon\u2019s empiricism has sometimes been thought to have arisen\nfrom his experience as a practicing physician (Guthrie 1962). He has\nalso been hailed as the first to use dissection, but this is based on\na hasty reading of the evidence. Calcidius, in his Latin commentary on\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus, praises Alcmaeon, along with\nCallisthenes and Herophilus, for having brought many things to light\nabout the nature of the eye (DK, A10). Most of what Calcidius goes on\nto describe, however, are the discoveries of Herophilus some two\ncenturies after Alcmaeon (Lloyd 1975, Mansfeld 1975, Solmsen 1961).\nThe only conclusions we can reasonably draw about Alcmaeon from the\npassage are that he excised the eyeball of an animal and observed\nporoi (channels, i.e. the optic nerve) leading from the eye\nin the direction of the brain (Lloyd 1975). Theophrastus\u2019\naccount of Alcmaeon\u2019s theory of sensation implies that he\nthought that there were such channels leading from each of the senses\nto the brain:\n\nAll the senses are connected in some way with the brain. As a result,\nthey are incapacitated when it is disturbed or changes its place, for\nit then stops the channels, through which the senses operate. (DK, A5)\n\n\nThere is no evidence, however, that Alcmaeon dissected the eye itself\nor that he dissected the skull in order to trace the optic nerve all\nthe way to the brain. Alcmaeon\u2019s account of the other senses,\nfar from suggesting that he carried out dissections in order to\nexplain their function, implies that he did not (Lloyd 1975; for a\npartial critique of Lloyd see Perilli 2001). Alcmaeon\u2019s\nconclusion that all of the senses are connected to the brain may have\nbeen drawn from nothing more than the excision of the eye and the\ngeneral observation that the sense organs for sight, hearing, smell,\nand taste are located on the head and appear connected to passages\nwhich lead inward towards the brain (Gomperz 1953, 69). It is striking\nin this regard that Alcmaeon gave no account of touch (DK, A5), which\nis the only sense not specifically tied to the head. It would be a\nserious mistake then to say that Alcmaeon discovered dissection or\nthat he was the father of anatomy, since there is no evidence that he\nused dissection systematically or even that he did more than excise a\nsingle eyeball.\n2.4 Sense Perception\n\nTheophrastus says that Alcmaeon did not explain sensation by the\nprinciple of like to like (i.e. by the likeness between the sense\norgan and what is perceived), a principle which was used by many early\nGreek thinkers (e.g., Empedocles). Unfortunately he gives no general\naccount of how Alcmaeon did think sensation worked (DK, A5). Alcmaeon\nexplained each of the individual senses with the exception of touch,\nbut these accounts are fairly rudimentary. He regarded the eye as\ncomposed of water and fire and vision as taking place when what is\nseen is reflected in the gleaming and translucent part of the eye.\nHearing arises when an external sound is first transmitted to the\nouter ear and then picked up by the empty space (kenon) in\nthe inner ear, which transmits it to the brain. Taste occurs through\nthe tongue, which being warm and soft dissolves things with its heat\nand, because of its loose texture, receives and transmits the\nsensation. Smell is the simplest of all. It occurs \u201cat the same\ntime as we breathe in, thus bringing the breath to the brain\u201d\n(DK, A5).\n2.5 The Immortality of the Soul\n\nAlcmaeon developed the first argument for the immortality of the soul,\nbut the testimonia concerning it differ slightly from one another, and\nit appears to have been taken over and developed by Plato, so that it\nis very hard to determine exactly how to reconstruct Alcmaeon\u2019s\nown argument. Barnes (1982, 116\u2013120) and Hankinson (1998,\n30\u20133) provide the most insightful analysis. Alcmaeon appears to\nhave started from the assumption that the soul is always in motion. At\none extreme we might suppose that Alcmaeon only developed the simple\nargument from analogy, which Aristotle assigns to him (De An.\n405a29). The soul is like the heavenly bodies, which Alcmaeon regarded\nas divine and immortal (DK, A1, A12), in being always in motion, so it\nis also like them in being immortal. This is clearly fallacious, since\nit assumes that things that are alike in one respect will be alike in\nall others. The version in the doxographical tradition is more\nsophisticated (DK, A12). Alcmaeon thought that the soul moved itself\nin continual motion and was therefore immortal and like to the divine.\nThe similarity to the divine is not part of the inference here but\nsimply an illustrative comparison. However, Mansfeld has recently\npointed out that the doxographical report in Aetius is just a\nparaphrase of Aristotle\u2019s earlier report with the significant\naddition that the soul is self-moving. Examination of the context in\nAetius shows that the self-motion of the soul, which is attested\nindependently for Plato and Xenocrates, was projected back on\nPythagoras and Thales, who are very unlikely to have held such a view.\nThis context and Aristotle\u2019s failure to assign self-motion to\nAlcmaeon makes it likely that the same projection occurred in the case\nof Alcmaeon, who thus is likely to have assigned continual motion but\nnot self motion to the soul (Mansfeld 2014b, see also Laks 2018). The\ncore of the simpler argument is the necessary truth that what is\nalways in motion must be immortal. This is the assumption from which\nPlato starts his argument for the immortality of the soul\nat Phaedrus 245c, but how much of Plato\u2019s analysis of\nwhat is always in motion can be assigned to Alcmaeon? Plato makes no\nmention of Alcmaeon in the passage. There are still serious questions\nfor Alcmaeon, even on the more sophisticated version of the\nargument. We might well recognize that things with souls, i.e. things\nthat are alive, are able to move themselves, and conclude that it is\nsouls that bring this motion about. We might also conclude that the\nsoul, as what moves something else, must be in motion itself (the\nsynonymy principle of causation).  But why did Alcmaeon suppose that\nthe soul must be always in motion?  (Hankinson [1998, 32] provides two\npossible answers and discusses the difficulties with them.) Horn\nargues that there is no obvious meaning to the idea that the human\nsoul is in continual motion so that Alcmaeon must be talking about a\nworld soul, which has the continual motion of the heavens (2005,\n157\u20138). However, Mansfeld rightly argues that Aristotle\u2019s\nreport on Alcmaeon\u2019s view of the soul is clearly about the human\nsoul; since the soul being discussed is said to be similar to the\nheavenly motions it has to be distinct from them (2014a). Finally,\nwhat sort of motion is being ascribed to souls? The natural assumption\nmight be that the soul\u2019s motion is thinking, but, at this early\npoint in Greek thought, Alcmaeon was more likely to have thought that,\nif the soul is going to cause motion in space, it too must be in\nlocomotion. Plato describes the soul as composed of two circles with\ncontrary motions, which imitate the contrary motions of the fixed\nstars and the planets, so that the soul becomes a sort of orrery in\nthe head (Timaeus 44d). It has been suggested that this image\nis borrowed from Alcmaeon (Barnes 1982, 118; Skemp 1942, 36 ff.).\n\nIn Fragment 2, Alcmaeon is reported to have said that:\n\nHuman beings perish because they are not able to join their beginning\nto their end.\n\n\nAt first sight, this assertion might appear to conflict with\nAlcmaeon\u2019s belief that the soul is immortal. It seems likely,\nhowever, that Alcmaeon distinguished between human beings as\nindividual bodies, which do perish, and as souls, which do not (Barnes\n1982, 115). There is no evidence about what Alcmaeon thought happened\nto the soul, when the body perished, however. Did he believe in\nreincarnation as the Pythagoreans did? No ancient source associates\nAlcmaeon with reincarnation and his sharp distinction between animals\nand human beings may suggest that he did not believe in it (Guthrie\n1962: 354). He might have thought that the soul joined other divine\nbeings in the heavens. The point of Fragment 2 may be that, whereas\nthe heavenly bodies do join their beginnings to their ends in circular\nmotion, humans are not able to join their end in old age to their\nbeginning in childhood, i.e. human life does not have a cyclical\nstructure. We might even suppose that the soul tries to impose such a\nstructure on the body from its own circular motion but ultimately\nfails (Guthrie 1962, 353). It has been rather speculatively suggested\nthat, since Alcmaeon explains sleep and waking by the blood retreating\ninto the inner vessels and then expanding again into the outer vessels\n(see 3.2 below), it may be that this \u201ccircular motion\u201d of\nthe blood that fails in death (Kouloumentas 2018b).\n3. Medical Doctrines\n3.1 Health and Disease\n\nFragment 4 presents Alcmaeon\u2019s account of health and\ndisease:\n\nAlcmaeon said that the equality (isonomia) of the powers\n(wet, dry, cold, hot, bitter, sweet, etc.) maintains health but that\nmonarchy among them produces disease.\n\n\nThis is, in fact, not a fragment but a testimonium and much of the\nlanguage comes from the doxographical tradition rather than Alcmaeon.\nThe report goes on to say that Alcmaeon thought that disease arose\nbecause of an excess of heat or cold, which in turn arose because of\nan excess or deficiency in nutrition. Disease is said to arise in the\nblood, the marrow, or the brain. It can also be caused by external\nfactors such as the water, the locality, toil, or violence. The idea\nthat health depends on a balance of opposed factors in the body is a\ncommonplace in Greek medical writers. Although Alcmaeon is the\nearliest figure to whom such a conception of health is attributed, it\nmay well be that he is not presenting an original thesis but rather\ndrawing on the earlier medical tradition in Croton. Perhaps what is\ndistinctive to Alcmaeon is the use of the specific political metaphor\nand most scholars (e.g., Sassi 2007, 198; Jouanna 1999, 327;\nKouloumentas 2014, 871) agree that the political terminology\n(isonomia, monarchia) goes back to him. Indeed,\nthese terms are not found elsewhere in the Greek medical\ntradition. Just as Anaximander explained the order of the cosmos in\nterms of justice in the city-state, so Alcmaeon used a political\nmetaphor to explain the order of the human body. It is commonly\nrecognized that isonomia (equality) is not a specific form of\ngovernment but rather a concept of political equality in terms of\nwhich forms of government are evaluated (Ostwald 1969, 108; Meier\n1990, 162 calls it a \u201cyardstick\u201d, Vlastos 1981,\n173\u201374 a \u201cbanner\u201d). Its primary application is to\ndemocracies (Herodotus III.80) but it is also applied to moderate\noligarchies that have democratic features (Thucydides III.\n62.3\u20134). Although a significant number of scholars argue that\nthere is a purely aristocratic application for isonomia as\nthe equality of aristocratic peers in opposition to a tyrant (e.g.,\nRaaflaub 2004: 95; Zhmud 2012a: 358), one of the most noted early\nadherents of this view later abandoned it (Ehrenberg 1956: 67) and it\nappears more likely that the term  isonomia originated with\nthe radical democracy which emerged in Athens in the late sixth\ncentury and was only applied in a secondary sense to moderate\noligarchies (Vlastos 1973, 175\u20137; Ostwald 1969, 99\u2013106).\nIs Alcmaeon\u2019s use of the term simply descriptive of the equality\nof powers that is necessary for the healthy body, or does his use of\nthe term to describe health suggest that he was in sympathy with\nradical democracy (Vlastos 1953, 363)? We simply have no direct\nevidence for Alcmaeon\u2019s political views. However, Aristotle\nemphasizes that Alcmaeon posited an indefinite number of opposites as\nactive in the human body in contrast to the Pythagoreans who specified\nten pairs (see 4.2 below), which suggests that Alcmaeon\u2019s\n\u201cbody\u201d politic was not an oligarchy with a numerically\ndefined group of peers but rather a democracy which gave equality to\nthe full range of opposites. Mansfeld has recently argued that\nscholars are wrong to ascribe the key terms  isonomia and\nmonarchia to Alcmaeon (Mansfeld 2014a). Such a metaphorical\nuse of isonomia is unparalleled at this early date and is\nmuch more likely to have been introduced later in the doxographical\ntradition. Moreover, monarchia may have been introduced by a\ndoxographer familiar with its use in the famous debate on\nconstitutions in Herodotus (III 80\u20133), where isonomia\nalso appears (III 80). Mansfeld concludes that this origin of the\nterms from the doxography is more likely than assuming influence on\nAlcmaeon from the reforms of Cleisthenes. The difficulty with\nMansfeld\u2019s approach is that the striking thing about the report\non Alcmaeon is precisely the political metaphor and it seems more\nplausible that his views were introduced into the doxography because\nof that metaphor than that his views were typical Greek views on\ndisease and the metaphor only arose as an artefact of the\ndoxographical tradition. If he did introduce the political metaphor\nthen it is as probable as not that he used the terms ascribed to him,\nespecially since both appear only a little later in Herodotus,\nalthough not with a metaphorical sense. \n3.2 Sleep, Embryology, and the Use of Analogy\n\nAlcmaeon is the first to raise a series of questions in human and\nanimal physiology that later become stock problems, which every\nthinker tries to address. He thus sets the initial agenda for Greek\nphysiology (Longrigg 1993, 54\u20137; Lloyd 1966, 322 ff.). He said\nthat sleep is produced by the withdrawal of the blood away from the\nsurface of the body to the larger (\u201cblood-flowing\u201d)\nvessels and that we awake when the blood diffuses throughout the body\nagain (DK, A18). Death occurs when the blood withdraws entirely.\nHippocratic writers (Epid. VI 5.15) and Aristotle\n(H.A. 521a15) both seem to have adopted Alcmaeon\u2019s\naccount of sleep. It is very unlikely, however, that Alcmaeon\ndistinguished between veins (the \u201cblood-flowing vessels\u201d)\nand arteries, as some have claimed. It is more likely that he simply\ndistinguished between larger more interior blood vessels as opposed to\nsmaller ones close to the surface (Lloyd 1991, 177). He probably\nargued that human seed was drawn from the brain (DK, A13). It has\nrecently been suggested (K\u00f6nig 2019), however, that he instead\nthought 1) that sperm came from the whole body, 2) that the brain was\nits transit port and 3) that it was ultimately a product of\ndigestion. But no ancient source directly assigns any of these\ndoctrines to Alcmaeon and the arguments in favor of them are very\nindirect. Contrary to a popular Greek view, which regarded the father\nalone as providing seed, a view that would be followed by Aristotle\n(Lloyd 1983, 86 ff.), Alcmaeon may have argued that both parents\ncontribute seed (DK, A13) and that the child takes the sex of the\nparent who contributes the most seed (DK, A14). It has recently been\nsuggested, however, that our sole source for these views (Censorinus)\nis mistaken and that, while Alcmaeon thought that both the male and\nfemale contributed to the child, only the male contributed seed\n(Leitao 2012: 278\u201379), the female contributing menses. According\nto one report, Alcmaeon thought that the head was the first part of\nthe embryo to develop, although another report has him confessing that\nhe did not have definite knowledge in this area, because no one is\nable to perceive what is formed first in the infant (DK, A13). These\nreports are not inconsistent and conform to the epistemology with\nwhich Alcmaeon began his book. It is plausible to suppose that he\nregarded the development of the embryo as one of the imperceptibles\nabout which we can have no certain knowledge. On the other hand, he\nmay have regarded it as a reasonable inference that the part of the\nbody which controls it in life, i.e., the brain, developed first in\nthe womb. Dissection is of obvious relevance to the debate about the\ndevelopment of the embryo, and Alcmaeon\u2019s failure to appeal to\ndissection of animals in this case is further evidence that he did not\nemploy it as a regular method (Lloyd 1979, 163). Alcmaeon studied not\njust humans but also animals and plants. He gave an explanation of the\nsterility of mules (DK, B3) and, if we can believe Aristotle, thought\nthat goats breathed through their ears (DK, A7). More significantly,\nhe used analogies with animals and plants in developing his accounts\nof human physiology. Thus, the pubic hair that develops when human\nmales are about to produce seed for the first time at age fourteen is\nanalogous to the flowering of plants before they produce seed (DK,\nA15); milk in mammals is analogous to egg white in birds (DK,\nA16). The infant in the womb absorbs nutrients through its entire\nbody, like a sponge, although another report suggests that the embryo\nalready feeds through its mouth (DK, A17). However, the text of the\nlatter report should perhaps be amended from stomati [mouth]\nto\ns\u00f4mati [body], thus removing the contradiction\n(Olivieri 1919, 34). Analogies such as these will become a staple item\nin later Greek biological treatises, but Alcmaeon is one of the\nearliest figures in this tradition.\n\n4. Cosmology\n4.1 Astronomy\n\nAs indicated in section 1 above, there is considerable controversy as\nto whether and to what extent Alcmaeon was a typical Presocratic\ncosmologist. Certainly the evidence for his cosmology is meager. There\nare three references to his astronomical theory (DK, A4). He is\nreported to have recognized that the planets have a motion from west\nto east opposite to the motion of the fixed stars. Some doubt that\nsuch knowledge was available at the beginning of the fifth century\n(Dicks 1970, 75). Others suggest that Anaximenes, in the second half\nof the sixth century, had already distinguished between the fixed\nstars, which are nailed to the ice-like vault of the sky, and planets\nwhich float on the air like leaves (DK13A7; Burkert 1972, 311).\nAlcmaeon\u2019s belief that the sun is flat is another possible\nconnection to Anaximenes, who said that the sun was flat like a leaf\n(DK13A15). Finally, another similarity to Ionian astronomy is found in\nAlcmaeon\u2019s agreement with Heraclitus that lunar eclipses were to\nbe explained by the turning of a bowl-shaped moon. One might have\nexpected, however, that the moon would be flat like the sun (West\n1971, 175).\n4.2 Opposites\n\nDid Alcmaeon present a cosmogony or cosmology in terms of the\ninteraction of pairs of opposites? Such a cosmology could be seen as\nyet another connection to earlier speculation in Ionia, since\nAnaximander\u2019s cosmos is based on the \u201cjustice\u201d\nestablished between conflicting opposites (DK12B1). Heraclitus is also\na possible influence on Alcmaeon, since he seems to envisage an\nendless process of opposites turning into one another such as is\nproposed for Alcmaeon (Mansfeld 2014a, 91\u20132). Aristotle provides\nthe primary evidence for such a cosmology in Alcmaeon\n(Metaph. 986a22 ff. = A3), but he compares Alcmaeon not to\nthe Ionians but to a group of Pythagoreans who proposed a table of ten\npairs of opposites. Alcmaeon agrees with these Pythagoreans in\nregarding the opposites as principles of things. Aristotle complains,\nhowever, that Alcmaeon did not arrive at a definite set of opposites\nbut spoke haphazardly of white, black, sweet, bitter, good, bad,\nlarge, and small, and only threw in vague comments about the remaining\nopposites. It may well be that Alcmaeon\u2019s primary discussion of\nopposites was in relation to his account of the human body (DK, B4;\nsee the discussion of his medical theories above). Aristotle\u2019s\nlanguage supports this suggestion to some extent, when he summarizes\nAlcmaeon\u2019s view as that \u201cthe majority of human\nthings (t\u00f4n anthr\u00f4pin\u00f4n) are in\npairs\u201d (Metaph. 986a31). Isocrates (DK, A3) says that\nAlcmaeon, in contrast to Empedocles, who postulated four elements,\nsaid that there were only two, and, according to a heterodox view,\nAlcmaeon posited fire and earth as basic elements (Lebedev 1993). Most\nscholars follow Aristotle, however, in supposing that Alcmaeon thought\nthat the human body and perhaps the cosmos is constituted from the\nbalance of an indefinite number of opposites. Some have seen\nAlcmaeon\u2019s unwillingness to adopt a fixed set of opposites as a\nvirtue and a further sign of his empiricism, which is willing to\naccept that the world is less tidy than theoretical constructs, such\nas the Pythagorean table of opposites, would suggest (Guthrie 1962,\n346).\n5. Importance and Influence\n\nAlcmaeon has been somewhat neglected in recent scholarship on early\nGreek philosophy (e.g., he hardly appears in Curd and Graham 2008,\nLong 1999 and Taylor 1997, the most recent surveys of the subject, but\nboth Guthrie 1962 and now Zhmud 2012a and 2014 stress his importance).\nThere would appear to be several reasons for this neglect. First, what\nremains of Alcmaeon\u2019s book has little to say on the metaphysical\nquestions about the first principles of the cosmos and about being,\nwhich have dominated recent scholarship on the Presocratics. Second,\ndoubts about his date and about the focus of his investigations have\nmade it difficult to place him in the development of early Greek\nthought. Finally, a more accurate appreciation of his use of\ndissection has deflated some of the hyperbolic claims in earlier\nscholarship about his originality. The extent of his originality and\nthe importance of his influence depend to a degree on his dating. An\nextremely late dating for his activity (after 450 BCE) makes him\nappear to espouse the typical views of the age rather than to break\nnew ground. If he was active in the early fifth century, his views are\nmuch more original. That Aristotle wrote a separate treatise in\nresponse to Alcmaeon argues in favor of his originality. He should\nprobably be regarded as a pioneer in applying a political metaphor to\nthe balance of opposites that constitute the healthy human body. The\nrange of his work in biology is remarkable for the early fifth century\nand he may have initiated a physiological emphasis in Greek philosophy\nwhich was not present in Ionian philosophers, such as Anaximander and\nAnaximenes, and set the agenda in this area for later Presocratics\n(Zhmud 2012a, 366). It is sometimes said that his conception of\nporoi (channels), which connect the sense organs to the\nbrain, influenced Empedocles\u2019 theory of poroi, but the\ntheories may share no more than the name. In Empedocles, all materials\nhave pores in them, which determine whether they mix well with other\nobjects. Sense organs also have pores, but these function not to\nconnect the sense organ to the seat of intelligence (which for\nEmpedocles is the heart) but to determine whether the sense organ can\nreceive the effluences that are poured forth by external objects\n(Solmsen 1961, 157; Wright 1981, 230). Alcmaeon\u2019s influence was\nsignificant in three final ways: 1) His identification of the brain as\nthe seat of human intelligence influenced Philolaus (DK, B13), the\nHippocratic Treatise, On the Sacred Disease, and Plato\n(Timaeus 44d), although a number of thinkers including\nEmpedocles and Aristotle continued to regard the heart as the seat of\nperception and intelligence. 2) His empiricist epistemology may lie\nbehind important passages in Plato (Phaedo 96b) and Aristotle\n(Posterior Analytics 100a). 3) He developed the first\nargument for the immortality of the soul, which may have influenced\nPlato\u2019s argument in the Phaedrus (245c ff.).\n",
