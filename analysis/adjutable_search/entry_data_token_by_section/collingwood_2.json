    "main_text": "Metaphilosophy || Presuppositional analysis\n2.2 Presuppositional analysis\n\nCollingwood returned to the question of the role of philosophical\nanalysis in his second metaphilosophical treatise, An Essay on\nMetaphysics (1940). While the commitment to the view that\nphilosophy disambiguates concepts that coincide in their instances\npersists, Collingwood presents the role of philosophical analysis in a\ndifferent way, by saying that philosophy\u2019s task is to uncover\nthe presuppositions of thought. This change of emphasis, as we shall\nsee, is at least in part motivated by an attempt to present his\nmetaphilosophical views in a language to which the emerging school of\nanalytic philosophy would have been more receptive and to engage in a\ndialogue with A.J. Ayer\u2019s logical positivist critique of\nmetaphysics.\n\nThe task of philosophy, Collingwood claims in An Essay on\nMetaphysics, is not to assert propositions in answers to\nquestions but to uncover presuppositions. Philosophy is\ntherefore concerned not with propositions but with presuppositions.\nPropositions are answers to questions. For example, the proposition\n\u201cThis is a clothes line\u201d answers the question \u201cWhat\nis that thing for?\u201d (EM 1998: 24). Presuppositions, on the other\nhand give rise to questions. When one asks, \u201cWhat is that thing\nfor?\u201d one must presuppose \u201cthat it is \u2018for\u2019\nsomething\u201d (EM 1998: 26). Without any presuppositions the\nquestion would not arise.\n\nPresuppositions differ from propositions in one fundamental respect:\npropositions have truth-values. They are asserted as either true or\nfalse. Presuppositions, on the other hand lack truth values; they are\nneither true nor false. This is because they do not fulfil their role\n(that of giving rise to questions) in virtue of being true or false.\nJust as the validity of an inference does not depend on whether the\npremises from which the inference is drawn are true or false, so the\n\u201clogical efficacy\u201d (EM 1998: 27) of a presupposition,\ni.e., its power to give rise to a question, does not depend on the\npresupposition being either true or false, or even on being believed\nto be true or false. This consideration, Collingwood says,\n\n\nis a matter of common knowledge in scientific thinking; where it is\ncommon and even profitable to argue from suppositions we know to be\nfalse, or which we believe to be false, or concerning which we have\nneither knowledge nor belief as to whether we are false or true. These\ndoubts or negations in no way affect the validity of the argument. (EM\n1998: 28)\n\n\nWhether a statement is a \u201cproposition\u201d or a\n\u201cpresupposition\u201d is determined not by its content but by\nthe role that the statement plays in the logic of question and answer.\nIf its role is to answer a question, then it is a proposition and it\nhas a truth-value. If its role is to give rise to a question, then it\nis a presupposition and it does not have a truth-value. Some\nstatements can play different roles. They may be both\npropositional answers to questions and presuppositions which\ngive rise to questions. For example, that an object is for something,\nthat it has a function may be a presupposition which gives rise to the\nquestion \u201cwhat is that thing for?\u201d, but it may also be an\nanswer to a question if the statement has the role of an assertion.\nPhilosophical analysis is concerned with a special kind of\npresupposition, one which has only one role in the logic of question\nand answer, namely that of giving rise to questions. Collingwood calls\nthese presuppositions \u201cabsolute\u201d. Absolute presuppositions\nare foundational assumptions that enable certain lines of questioning\nbut are not themselves open to scrutiny. The three senses of causation\ndiscussed above are examples of absolute presuppositions which\nstructure different forms of inquiry. A physician, for example,\nabsolutely presupposes sense II of causation, according which a cause\nis\n\n\nan event or state of things by producing or preventing which we can\nproduce or prevent that whose cause it is said to be. (EM 1998:\n296\u20137)\n\n\nQua practical scientist of nature, the physician absolutely\npresupposes a handle or manipulability conception of causation which\nmakes it possible to intervene in nature to achieve certain intended\nresults, i.e., to restore health. This sense of causation is at work\nin statement such as \u201cThe cause of malaria is the bite of a\nmosquito\u201d (EM 1998: 299) or \u201cthe cause of a man\u2019s\nsweating is a dose of aspirin\u201d (EM 1998: 299). The\npresupposition is absolute because it could not be questioned without\nat the same time undermining the kind of inquiry it makes possible.\nAbsolute presuppositions in this respect differ from relative\npresuppositions. A physician prescribes a dose of aspirin on the\nassumption it will cause a patient to break into a sweat. This\npresupposition is relative because it could potentially be overthrown\nby future research. But the underlying conception of causation is a\ncondition sine qua non for practising medicine. It is these\nabsolute presuppositions that philosophy seeks to uncover by\nregressing from propositional answers to the questions they are\nanswers to, and from the questions to the presuppositions which must\nbe made for the questions to arise.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s denial that absolute presuppositions have truth\nvalues informs a commitment to a kind of explanatory pluralism\naccording to which the choice between different kinds of explanation\ndoes not depend on whether they capture pure being but on whether they\nare fit for purpose. He illustrates this explanatory pluralism by\nimagining a scenario in which a car stops while driving up a steep\nhill. As the driver stands by the side of the road a passerby, who\nhappens to be a theoretical physicist offers his help. The car, he\nexplains, has stopped because\n\n\nthe top of a hill is farther removed from the earth\u2019s centre\nthan its bottom and \u2026 consequently more power is needed to take\nthe car uphill than to take her along the level. (EM 1998: 302)\n\n\nA second passerby (who happens to be an Automobile\nAssociation\u00a0man)\u00a0proffers a different explanation: he holds\nup a loose cable and says \u201cLook here, Sir, you are running on\nthree cylinders\u201d (EM 1998: 303). The first explanation invokes\nthe sense of causation that belongs to the theoretical sciences of\nnature, sense III. The second explanation invokes the sense of\ncausation that belongs to the practical sciences of nature, sense II.\nThe choice between these explanations, for Collingwood is determined\nby the nature of the question asked. As he puts it:\n\n\nIf I had been a person who could flatten out hills by stamping on them\nthe passerby would have been right to call my attention to the hill as\nthe cause of the stoppage; not because the hill was a hill but because\nI was able to flatten it out. (EM 1998: 303)\n\n\nThis scenario illustrates that there are different explanations,\ncorresponding to different senses of causation, each answering a\ndifferent kind of question. When the different senses of causation are\ndisambiguated, then it becomes clear that there is no conflict between\nthe explanation of the theoretical physicist and that of the car\nmechanic, because they answer different kinds of questions, questions\nwhich differ because they are entailed by different absolute\npresuppositions. Explanations genuinely conflict with one another only\nif they provide answers to the same question, but they do not if they\nare answering different questions. The task of presuppositional\nanalysis is to undo the conceptual knots in which our thoughts get\ntangled when we mix and match answers of one kind with questions of\nanother by failing to see the entailment relations which hold between\npresuppositions, the question to which they give rise, and the sort of\npropositional answers which address those questions:\n\n\nIn unscientific thinking our thoughts are coagulated into knots and\ntangles; we fish up a thought out of our minds like an anchor foul of\nits own cable, hanging upside-down and draped in seaweed with\nshellfish sticking to it and dump the whole thing on deck quite\npleased with ourselves for having got it up at all. Thinking\nscientifically means disentangling all this mess, and reducing a knot\nof thoughts in which everything sticks together anyhow to a system or\nseries of thoughts in which thinking the thoughts is at the same time\nthinking the connexions between them. (EM 1998: 22\u201323)\n\n\nThe logical inquiry into the connections holding between\npresuppositions, questions and answers is the true task of conceptual\nanalysis in metaphysics, a task that must replace metaphysics\ntraditionally understood as the study of pure being. There is no such\nthing as knowledge of pure being because there can be no\npresuppositionless knowledge and there can be no presuppositionless\nknowledge because all knowledge is pursued in answer to questions and\nno question could arise if no presuppositions were made. The study of\nreality under the different aspects enabled by the adoption of\ndifferent presuppositions is not an ontological but a logical enquiry\nand metaphysics, so understood is, a \u201cmetaphysics without\nontology\u201d (EM 1998: 18).\n\nFailure to recognise that knowledge rests on presuppositions\nencourages the belief that pure being is a possible object of\nknowledge. Traditionally it was metaphysics that was deemed to be the\nscience of pure being. In the aftermath of the scientific revolution\nthis role was increasingly claimed by the most fundamental of the\nsciences: physics. If Collingwood\u2019s claim that metaphysics\nshould take the form of a logical enquiry into presuppositions is\nright, then there is no contest between metaphysics and physics or\nmore generally between philosophy and (natural) science because no\nform of knowledge can claim the title of science of pure being.\nPhilosophy does not conflict with natural science because it does not\nadvance claims about the nature of reality but about the\npresuppositions under which all sciences, including natural science,\noperate. Nor is there conflict between (natural) science and other\nforms of knowledge because different forms of knowledge answer\ndifferent kinds of questions, questions which arise from different\npresuppositions. In reminding philosophers that all knowledge,\nincluding scientific knowledge, rests on presuppositions, Collingwood\nrehabilitates the older, Latin sense of the term scientia\nwhich is not synonymous with natural science but with \u201ca body of\nsystematic or orderly thinking about a determinate\nsubject-matter\u201d (EM 1998: 4). The use of \u201cscience\u201d\nto mean \u201cnatural science\u201d is a slang use of the\nterm (EM 1998: 4) that has that is symptomatic of the prevalence of\nscientism, the belief that only scientific knowledge is a form of\nknowledge and that science can answer all questions.\n\nCollingwood\u2019s account of absolute presuppositions generates an\ninteresting angle on the question of scepticism concerning induction.\nHume had argued that inductive inferences rely on the principle of the\nuniformity of nature. If it is true that the future resembles the\npast, then inferences such as \u201cthe sun will rise tomorrow\u201d\nare inductively justified. However, since the principle is neither a\nproposition about matters of fact nor one about relations of ideas the\nproposition \u201cnature is uniform\u201d is an illegitimate\nmetaphysical proposition and inductive inferences lack justification.\nThe principle of the uniformity of nature, Collingwood argues, is not\na proposition, but an absolute presupposition, one which cannot be\ndenied without undermining empirical science. As it is an absolute\npresupposition the notion of verifiability does not apply to it\nbecause it does its job not in so far as it is true, or even believed\nto be true, but in so far as it is presupposed. The demand that it\nshould be verified is nonsensical and the question that Hume ask does\nnot therefore arise:\n\n\n\u2026any question involving the presupposition that an absolute\npresupposition is a proposition, such as the question \u201cIs it\ntrue?\u201d \u201cWhat evidence is there for it?\u201d \u201cHow\ncan it be demonstrated?\u201d \u201cWhat right have we to presuppose\nit if it can\u2019t?\u201d, is a nonsense question. (EM 1998:\n33)\n\n\nSimilar considerations, as we shall see later, are invoked by\nCollingwood against Ayer\u2019s principle of verifiability.\n",
