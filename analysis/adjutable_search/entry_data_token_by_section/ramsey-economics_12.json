    "main_text": "The Ramsey Rule and Its Ramifications || Numerical Estimates of the Optimum Rate of Saving\n4.4 Numerical Estimates of the Optimum Rate of Saving\n\n\nEquation (18) says that \\(s^*\\) is an increasing function of the\nreturn on investment \\((\\mu)\\), a decreasing function of the time rate of\ndiscount \\((\\delta)\\), and a decreasing function of the elasticity of\nmarginal well-being \\((\\sigma)\\). Each of these properties is intuitively\nobvious:\n\n\n(1) The higher is the rate of return on investment \\((\\mu)\\), the\ngreater is the gain to future generations from a marginal increase in\nsaving by initial generations. That says the optimum rate of saving\nshould be an increasing function of \\(\\mu\\), other things equal.\n\n\n(2) The larger is the value of the time discount rate \\((\\delta)\\)\nchosen by DM, the lower is the weight that she awards to the well-being\nof future generations. That implies higher optimum consumption levels\nfor early generations (Sect. 2.1), which in turn implies that the\noptimum rate of saving is lower, other things equal.\n\n\n(3) As the return on investment is positive \\((\\mu \\gt 0)\\), the arrow\nof time displays a bias in favour of future generations (Sect. 2.1).\nBut the larger is the chosen value of \\(\\sigma\\), the more DM displays\nconcerns over equity in consumption across the generations. Therefore,\nthe larger is that concern, the higher is the optimum rate of\nconsumption to be enjoyed by initial generations. So we should expect\nthe optimum rate of saving to be a decreasing function of \\(\\sigma\\),\nother things equal.\n\n\nIt is instructive to consider stylized figures for the parameters on\nthe right-hand-sides of equations (18) and (19), respectively. Although\nstylized, they are figures for the pair of ethical parameters \\(\\sigma\\)\nand \\(\\delta\\) that economists who have written on the economics of\nclimate change have assumed in their work. To be sure, the welfare\neconomics of climate change has demanded more complicated models than\nthe model that is represented in equations (1) and (11a), but as we\nconfirm below, it has not offered any additional theoretical\ninsights. In what follows we take a year to be the unit of time and\nassume that \\(\\mu = 0.05\\) (i.e., 5% a year). Along the optimum, the\nconsumption rate of interest equals the rate of return on investment\n(the Ramsey Rule), which means that the optimum consumption rate of\ninterest equals a constant 5% a year.\n\n\nA figure of 5% a year for \\(\\mu\\) implies a capital-output ratio\n\\((1/\\mu)\\) of 20 years, which is far higher than the estimates of\ncapital-output ratios from inter-industry studies that economists in\nvarious parts of the world have arrived at (Behrman 2001); a\nrepresentative figure for 1/\\(\\mu\\) in that literature is 3 years. But\ntheir estimates have been based on a definition of\n\u201ccapital\u201d that is confined to \u201cproduced\u201d\ncapital, such as factories, roads, ports, and buildings. Human capital\n(education, health, knowledge) is missing from them, as is natural\ncapital (ecosystems, sub-soil resources). Ramsey\u2019s model, as\nencapsulated in equation (11a), embraces all forms of capital goods. No\ndoubt his formulation requires a heroic (read, impossible!) feat of\naggregation, but when all capital goods that enter production are taken\ninto account, we should expect an aggregate capital-output ratio (which\nwe should call the (inclusive) wealth-output ratio), to be a lot higher\nthan 3 years; perhaps even higher than 20 years (Arrow et al., 2012,\n2013). Large categories of capital goods are absent from the national\neconomic accounts that inform we economists\u2019 understanding of\nproduction and consumption possibilities (Dasgupta, 2019). It would\nthus seem there is still a long way to go before we can reach a good\napproximation of what we should bequeath to our descendants.\n\nExample 3 (taken from the economics of climate\nchange)\n\nWe now turn our attention to the values of the two ethical parameters\nin equation (11b) that were chosen by three economists in their study\nof the economics of climate change.\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag*{Cline (1992)} \\sigma = 1.5 \\quad &\\text{and} \\quad \\delta = 0  \\\\\n\\tag*{Nordhaus (1994)} \\sigma = 1   \\quad &\\text{and} \\quad \\delta = 0.03 \\text{ (3% a year)} \\\\\n\\tag*{Stern (2007)} \\sigma = 1   \\quad &\\text{and} \\quad \\delta = 0.001 \\text{ (0.1% a year)} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n(NB: \\(\\sigma = 1\\) corresponds to the logarithmic well-being function,\nthat is \\(U(C) =\\) log\\(C\\), and can be obtained as\na limit of the functional form of \\(U(C)\\) in equation\n(11b) as \\(\\sigma \\rightarrow 1.)\\)\n\n\nWe impose those parameter values to find that the optimum saving\nrate \\(s^*\\) (eq. 18) and the optimum rate of growth of consumption\n(eq. 19) are, in turn:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{21a} s^* = 67\\% \\quad &\\text{and} \\quad g^* = 3.3\\% \\text{ a year (Cline)} \\\\\n\\tag{21b} s^* = 40\\% \\quad &\\text{and} \\quad g^* = 2.0\\% \\text{ a year (Nordhaus)} \\\\\n\\tag{21c} s^* = 98\\% \\quad &\\text{and} \\quad g^* = 4.9\\% \\text{ a year (Stern)} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n",
