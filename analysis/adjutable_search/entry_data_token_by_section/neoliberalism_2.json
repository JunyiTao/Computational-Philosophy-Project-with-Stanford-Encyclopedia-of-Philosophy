    "main_text": "Inadequate Descriptions || Neoliberalism as Ethos\n2.1 Neoliberalism as Ethos\n\nMany think that neoliberal societies put profit ahead of other central\nvalues. David Harvey, for instance, argues that\n\n\nneoliberalism values market exchange as \u201can ethic in itself,\ncapable of acting as a guide to all human action, and substituting for\nall previously held ethical beliefs\u201d. (2005: 3)\n\n\nGeorge Monbiot insists that neoliberalism\n\n\nsees competition as the defining characteristic of human relations. It\nredefines citizens as consumers. (2016)\n\n\nBrown (2019) agrees. Some say that neoliberalism is an ideology where\neveryone is supposed to focus on economic prosperity or economic\ngrowth. Others say that neoliberalism is an ethos of the firm that\nrejects corporate social responsibility, instead recommending that\nfirms focus solely on their bottom lines (Steger & Roy 2010:\n13).\n\nBut neoliberals instead advance a view about the design of social\ninstitutions, and not a particular ethos of social life. In fact, they\nhave rather little to say about how to live the good life. Instead,\nneoliberals argue that their defense of capitalism does not\nnecessitate profit seeking as a way of life and that markets do not\nproduce people with such an ethos. It is true that they think certain\nattitudes and values, such as an excessive focus on social justice,\nequality of outcomes, hostility to all pursuit of profit, can\nundermine the foundations of a free society. But that does not imply\nthat they embrace a consumerist ethos.\n\nTo illustrate, consider Friedman. Friedman holds that part of the case\nfor freedom is that we don\u2019t know what persons ought to value\nbecause no one really knows what the good life consists in; a free\nsociety is good because it allows people to experiment with different\nforms of life to answer those questions for themselves (Friedman 1987\n[2017: 185]). And while Friedman (1962a [2002: 133]) proclaimed that\ncorporations\u2019 first duty is to maximize profits for their\nshareholders and that public policy should ensure that the\nmaximization of profit works to the benefit of all, even he does not\nadvocate a particular account of what persons ought to value.\n\nHayek and Buchanan are even clearer in denying that the good life\nconsists in economic ends like wealth maximization. Buchanan (1991:\n343) emphasizes personal ethical responsibility, adhering to social\nnorms forbidding debt (1987: 456, 461), and following\n\u201cmoral-ethical rules or norms for behavior\u201d (1999: 451).\nHayek thinks social life in a free society requires that people follow\nan array of rules and norms that have nothing to do with profit\nseeking, since many of these rules are below our conscious thought\n(Hayek 1973). Surprisingly, both Hayek (1988: 135\u2013142) and G.\nBrennan and Buchanan (1985: 150) even think that free societies needed\npeople prepared to act based on fundamentally religious\nimpulses.\n\nAdmittedly, Friedman and Buchanan use homo economicus to\nunderstand much of human behavior. But Buchanan (Brennan and Buchanan\n1981: 81) understands homo economicus broadly; it could be\n\u201cseen to maximize almost anything at all\u201d, and so has no\ninherent commitment to, say, wealth maximization.\n",
