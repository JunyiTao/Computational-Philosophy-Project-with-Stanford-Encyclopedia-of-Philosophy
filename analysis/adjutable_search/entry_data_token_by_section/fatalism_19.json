But it could\nalso be averted by denying that God needs to be thought of as\nomniscient \u2014 at any rate if omniscience involves infallible\nknowledge of all facts. It could be argued that God\u2019s perfection\ndoes not require the infallible knowledge of all facts, but at most\nsuch knowledge of all facts that could possibly be known infallibly.\nSo, if it is logically impossible for someone to have infallible\nknowledge that Jones will mow the lawn and for Jones to have the power\nto refrain, it is no imperfection in God if he lacks such knowledge\n(Swinburne 1977, 172\u20138). It could also be argued that there is\nno need to attribute infallible knowledge to God at all (Lucas 1986\nand 1989b).\n",
