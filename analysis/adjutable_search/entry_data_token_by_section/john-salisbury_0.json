    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nJohn of Salisbury was born at Old Sarum (the former site of Salisbury)\nin England between 1115 and 1120. Specific knowledge of his family\nbackground and early life is scant; something is known of a brother,\nRichard, and a half-brother, Robert, both of whom held offices within\nthe English church. John probably received an early education at\nSalisbury and then at Exeter. The first date safely associated with\nhim is 1136, when he traveled to Paris to study at\nMont-Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve. In a famous autobiographical passage in\nthe Metalogicon, John narrates his twelve years of education,\nan important source for understanding French higher instruction in\nthis period. The list of his teachers includes many of the great\nthinkers of the mid-twelfth century, among them Peter Abelard, Robert\nof Melun, William of Conches, Thierry of Chartres, Adam de Petit Pont,\nGilbert of Poitiers, and Robert Pullan. John\u2019s studies\nencompassed speculative philosophy, rhetoric, linguistic theory,\nliterature, and theology. He seems to have tutored students during his\nlater years in Paris. It was also during these years (specifically,\n1141 to 1147) that John likely drafted the first two parts of his\n1852-line philosophical and satirical poem, the Entheticus de\ndogmate philosophorum (or Entheticus maior); the final\ntwo parts likely date from late 1154 to mid-1156 (the much shorter\nEntheticus minor prefaces the Policraticus).\n\nLike many educated churchmen of his era, John eventually entered the\ncorridors of power rather than the cloister or the classroom. Through\nthe assistance of his friend Peter of Celle, John joined, in 1148, the\nhousehold of Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury, a vocal and energetic\nadvocate of the rights of the English church. In his capacity as\nsecretary to Theobald, John was an omnicompetent administrator: He\ncomposed the Archbishop\u2019s letters, advised him on legal and\npolitical affairs, traveled often to the Continent as an\narchiepiscopal envoy, and altogether lived in the manner of a trusted\nintimate. John\u2019s first letter collection, which he assembled\nshortly after Theobald\u2019s death in 1161, is largely comprised of\nofficial letters under Theobald\u2019s name, augmented by letters\nJohn himself wrote on Canterbury\u2019s behalf and some personal\nmissives.\n\nTheobald\u2019s court attracted many clerics with training and\nexperience similar to John\u2019s own, so he could continue to\nindulge his intellectual pursuits in a sympathetic environment during\nthe 1140s and 1150s. John was counted a member of a circle of learned\nclerics, among whom was Thomas Becket (the future archbishop and\nmartyr), who was a trusted servant of Theobald before he was appointed\nKing Henry II\u2019s Chancellor in late 1154 (Nederman and Bollermann\n2020). John\u2019s activities on behalf of Theobald brought him into\ncontact with some of the most powerful and prominent men of\ntwelfth-century Europe. He was present at the Roman curia for many\ncrucial occurrences during the pontificate of Eugenius III\n(1145\u20131153), the final four years of which he later chronicled\nin his Historia Pontificalis (HP) (written during the early\nperiod of his Becket-related exile, likely early 1164 to early 1166).\nHe enjoyed a warm friendship with his fellow countryman Nicholas\nBreakspear, who ascended the papal throne as Adrian IV in 1154. John\nwas also well-acquainted with important figures in twelfth-century\nsecular life, in France as well as England, most especially Henry II.\nJohn had supported Henry\u2019s side in the struggle against the\npartisans of King Stephen during the period of English history known\nas the Anarchy. John was, however, sufficiently vocal in his\nopposition to Henry\u2019s policies toward the English church to be\nbanished from the royal court during 1156 and 1157. Although he\nultimately recovered favor, he acquired a lingering skepticism about\nHenry\u2019s motives that was to be confirmed by later events. As\nbusy as John seems to have been with Canterbury administration in the\nfinal years of Theobald\u2019s archiepiscopacy, this was also the\nperiod (late 1156 through late 1159) in which John produced the two\nworks for which he is best known and esteemed: the\nMetalogicon, which presents a survey of the scholastic\ncurriculum and a defense of the study of the trivium; and,\nthe Policraticus, a work of moral and political philosophy\ngrounded in a Ciceronian moderate skepticism and replete with\nexempla drawn from Biblical, patristic, and classical\nsources.\n\nAfter Becket became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, he began to\ndefend ecclesiastical liberty against Henry\u2019s encroachments,\npartly in response to which Becket tasked John with composing (in\nearly 1163) a hagiography of Anselm\u2014a prior Canterbury\narchbishop who\u2019d wrestled with overreaching English\nmonarchs\u2014in support of formal canonization. As the conflict\nbetween Becket and Henry deepened, John backed the church\u2019s\ncause against the English crown, albeit somewhat reluctantly. John\nconsequently spent much of the 1160s in exile, either in France or at\nthe papal court, lobbying on behalf of Becket and against Henry and\nthe English bishops who backed the king. Most of the copious volume of\nletters contained in John\u2019s second letter collection date from\nand form important testimony to this period. Following Becket\u2019s\nmurder in December 1170, an event at which John was a bystander, he\nserved the English church in numerous capacities during the early\n1170s. Importantly, John wrote one of the earliest hagiographies of\nBecket, used in support of an initial canonization effort. John was\nconsecrated Bishop of Chartres in 1176 (a post in which he dedicated\nhimself to promoting the cult of Becket). He died there in 1180 and is\nburied in the nearby abbey church of Notre-Dame-de-Josaphat.\n",
