    "main_text": "The Ontological Status of Species || Species as Individuals\n2.2 Species as Individuals\n\nLet us turn to a popular view among philosophers and biologists\nconcerning the ontological status of species. Ghiselin (1974) and Hull\n(1978) suggest that instead of viewing species as natural kinds we\nshould think of them as individuals. Hull draws the ontological\ndistinction this way. (Instead of the phrase \u2018natural\nkind,\u2019 Hull uses the term \u2018class.\u2019) Classes are\ngroups of entities that can function in scientific laws. One\nrequirement of such laws is that they are true at any time and at any\nplace in the universe. If \u2018All copper conducts\nelectricity\u2019 is a law, then that law is true here and now, as\nwell as 100,000 years ago on some distant planet. Copper is a class\nbecause samples of copper are spatiotemporally unrestricted\n\u2014copper can occur anywhere in the universe. Individuals, unlike\nclasses, consist of parts that are spatiotemporally restricted. Think\nof a paradigmatic individual, a single mammalian organism. The parts\nof that organism cannot be scattered around the universe at different\ntimes if they are parts of a living, functioning organism. Various\nbiological processes, such as digestion and respiration, require that\nthose parts be causally and spatiotemporally connected. The parts of\nsuch an organism can only exist in a particular space-time region. In\nbrief, individuals consist of parts that are spatiotemporally\nrestricted. Classes consist of members that are spatiotemporally\nunrestricted.\n\nGiven the class/individual distinction, Ghiselin and Hull argue that\nspecies are individuals, not classes. Their argument assumes that the\nterm \u2018species\u2019 is a theoretical term in evolutionary\ntheory, so their argument focuses on the role of \u2018species\u2019\nin that theory. Here is Hull\u2019s version of the argument, which\ncan be dubbed the \u2018evolutionary unit argument.\u2019 Since\nDarwin, species have been considered units of evolution. When Hull\nasserts that species are units of evolution, he does not simply mean\nthat the gene frequencies of a species change from one generation to\nthe next. He has a more significant form of evolution in mind, namely\na trait going from being rare to being prominent in a species. A\nnumber of processes can cause a trait to become prominent in a\nspecies. Hull highlights selection. Selection causes a trait to become\nprominent in a species only if that trait is passed down from one\ngeneration to the next. If a trait is not heritable, the frequency of\nthat trait will not increase cumulatively. Hereditary relations,\ngenetic or otherwise, require the generations of a species to be\ncausally and hence spatiotemporally connected. So, if species are to\nevolve in non trivial ways by natural selection, they must be\nspatiotemporally continuous entities. Given that species are units of\nevolution, species are individuals and not classes. (For responses to\nthe Evolutionary Unit Argument see Dupr\u00e9 2001, Reydon 2003,\nCrane 2004, and Crawford 2008.)\n\nThe conclusion that species are individuals has a number of\ninteresting implications. For one, the relationship between an\norganism and its species is not a member/class relation but a\npart/whole relation. An organism belongs to a particular species only\nif it is appropriately causally connected to the other organisms in\nthat species. The organisms of a species must be parts of a single\nevolving lineage. If belonging to a species turns on an\norganism\u2019s insertion in a lineage, then qualitative similarity\ncan be misleading. Two organisms may be very similar morphologically,\ngenetically, and behaviorally, but unless they belong to the same\nspatiotemporally continuous lineage they cannot belong to the same\nspecies. Think of an analogy. Being part of my immediate family turns\non my wife, my children and I having certain biological relations to\none another, not our having similar features. It does not matter that\nmy son\u2019s best friend looks just like him. That friend is not\npart of our family. Similarly, organisms belong to a particular\nspecies because they are appropriately causally connected, not because\nthey look similar.\n\nAnother implication of the species are individuals thesis concerns our\nconception of human nature (Hull 1978). As we have seen, species are\nfirst and foremost genealogical lineages. An organism belongs to a\nspecies because it is part of a lineage not because it has a\nparticular qualitative feature. Humans may be a number of things. One\nof them is being the species Homo sapiens. From an\nevolutionary perspective, there is no biological essence to being a\nhuman. There is no essential feature that all and only humans must\nhave to be part of Homo sapiens. Humans are not essentially\nrational beings or social animals or ethical agents. An organism can\nbe born without any of these features and still be a human. From a\nbiological perspective, being part of the lineage Homo\nsapiens is both necessary and sufficient for being a human.
