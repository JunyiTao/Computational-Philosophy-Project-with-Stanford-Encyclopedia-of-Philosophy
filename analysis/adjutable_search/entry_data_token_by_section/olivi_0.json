    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nOlivi (ca. 1248\u20131298) was born in S\u00e9rignan, in the\nLanguedoc region of southern France. He entered the Franciscan order\nat the age of twelve, studied in Paris from 1267 to about 1272 (during\nthe final years of Bonaventure\u2019s generalate) without becoming a\nmaster of theology, and spent the remainder of his life teaching at\nvarious Franciscan houses of study in southern France, with a stay in\nFlorence from 1287\u201389. (For biographical details, see Burr 1976\nand 1989, and especially Piron 1998, 1999, 2006a.) Olivi\u2019s\noutspoken originality led him into conflict with religious\nauthorities: his writings were condemned by the Franciscan authorities\nin 1283, and although he was later rehabilitated by the new minister\ngeneral Matthew of Aquasparta, he remained a controversial figure. He\nspent the last part of his life as a lector at Montpellier and\nNarbonne. Soon after his death the Franciscan order renewed the\nprohibition on reading or retaining his works. Although his\nphilosophical views were controversial, what proved to be fatal was\nhis reputation within the so-called \u201cSpiritual\u201d reform\nmovement of the Franciscan order. Olivi\u2019s understanding of the\nFranciscan vow and poverty became influential among the spiritualists,\nand after his death he was venerated by fervent laymen in Languedoc.\nWhen Church officials took action against the spiritual movement,\nOlivi\u2019s reputation suffered a blow, which limited the influence\nhe would have on posterity. (See Burr 1989, 1993, 2001.)\n\nOlivi produced a large and wide-ranging body of work, much of which\nhas survived. By far the most important philosophical text is his\nSumma of questions on Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences, a\nmassive work he began writing soon after leaving Paris and redacted to\nits final form in the mid-1290s. This masterpiece of medieval\nphilosophy remains still largely untranslated, and edited only in\npart. Olivi\u2019s views on metaphysics and human nature are mostly\nfound in his questions on Bk. II (ed. Jansen, 1922\u201326). Material\non the virtues is found in Bk. III (ed. Emmen and Stadter, 1981).\nOther philosophically relevant works include his Quodlibeta\nfrom 1289\u201395 (ed. Defraia, 2002), a set of questions on logic\n(ed. Brown, 1986), and the Questions on Evangelical Perfection.\nMany of his biblical commentaries, the historically significant\nCommentary on the Apocalypse, and various texts pertaining to\nhis condemnation have survived and are available in modern editions.\n(For a recent list of editions, see K\u00f6nig-Pralong et al. 2010;\nfor the dating of works, see Piron 2020a.) In this article we provide\na brief outline of the most significant philosophical views that Olivi\ndefended, both in theoretical and practical philosophy.\n",
