    "main_text": "The Four-Fold Division || Said-Of and Not Present-In\n1.3 Said-Of and Not Present-In\n\nReturning, then, to those beings that are not-present in other beings,\nAristotle thinks that in addition to primary substances, which are\nparticulars, there are secondary substances, which are universals\n(2a11-a18). His example of such an entity is man (1a21), which,\naccording to the present interpretation, is a universal in the\ncategory of substance. If we again accept the distinctions in question\nas I have drawn them, we should interpret secondary substances as\nessential characteristics of primary substances. Moreover, because\nprimary substances seem to be members of natural kinds, it is natural\nto interpret secondary substances as the kinds to which primary\nsubstances belong. If that is so, then Aristotle thinks that not only\nare primary substances members of natural kinds but that they are\nessentially characterized by the kinds to which they belong.\n",
