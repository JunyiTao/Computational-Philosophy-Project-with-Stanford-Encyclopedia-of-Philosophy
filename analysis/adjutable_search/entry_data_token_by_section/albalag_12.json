    "main_text": "The Relationship Between Religion and Philosophy\n8. The Relationship Between Religion and Philosophy\n\nAlbalag is most famous in modern scholarship for his view of the\nrelationship between religion and philosophy. In the context of\nmedieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy, he stands out as perhaps the only\nphilosopher to straightforwardly stress, accept and account for the\ntension between philosophy and prophetic knowledge. His name is\nusually connected with the doctrine of the \u201cdouble truth\u201d,\nwhich maintains that the truth of prophecy and the truth of philosophy\nmay contradict each other while at the same time remaining\nsimultaneously true (Sirat 1985: 238; Zinberg 1973:\n107]; Vajda 1960: 264\u2013265). The origin of this doctrine had long\nbeen attributed to Averroes and Latin Averroists until recent studies\nchallenged this attribution. Some scholars have argued that the double\ntruth doctrine never existed as an actual dogma (Dales 1984).\nSimilarly, some scholars question the attribution of the double truth\ndoctrine to Albalag (Guttmann 1966: 227\u2013229) and Elijah\nDelmedigo, another Jewish Averroist whose treatment of the question in\ndiscussion involves some elements alluding to the double truth\ndoctrine (for Delmedigo, see Fraenkel 2013).\n\nThe discussion of the question of the relationship between religion\nand philosophy in the Tiqqun is complex and spans a number of\ncontexts. On the one hand, Albalag states in the preface to the\nTiqqun that there is no essential distinction between\nphilosophy and the Torah except that the former, addressing the select\nfew, conveys the truth in a demonstrative manner, while the latter,\naddressing the multitude, conveys the truth in a figurative language\nin accordance with their limited comprehension. By this means, Albalag\nseems to align with the understanding of religion as an imitation of\nphilosophy which was founded by al-Farabi and adopted by many Muslim\nand Jewish philosophers, most significantly Averroes and arguably\nMaimonides (see al-Farabi The Book of Letters: 19\u201326;\nMaimonides Guide: preface; Averroes Decisive\nTreatise: 1\u20133, 7\u201310). Both philosophers not only\nmaintain that religion and philosophy are compatible, but also accord\nphilosophy a crucial role in arriving at the true meaning of Scripture\n(Maimonides Guide: preface; Averroes Decisive\nTreatise: 1\u20133, 7\u201310). Furthermore, Averroes sets\nforth a religious epistemology based on the principle that\n\u201ctruth does not oppose truth; rather, it agrees with and bears\nwitness to it\u201d (Decisive: 9). On this principle,\ncontradictions between al-Shari\u02bfah (Religious Law) and\nphilosophy are viewed as mere apparent, rather than essential,\ncontradictions that result from the literary form of\nScripture\u2014consisting in similes, metaphors and\nstories\u2014which is directed to the multitude. Since\nal-Shari\u02bfah cares for all people, \u201cthe red and\nblack\u201d, it conveys the truth in different methods in accordance\nwith the diverse intellectual capacities of people and types of assent\nthey are fit for (ibid, 8). Only those who are adept in science\n(al-rasi\u1e96una fi-l\u02bfilm) can have access to the\ninternal meaning of Scripture, which is designed according to the\ntruth as it is, thereby attaining certain, demonstrative, assent to\nScripture. Drawing on Averroes\u2019 religious epistemology,\npost-Maimonidean philosophers, continuing Maimonides\u2019\nphilosophical-religious \nenterprise,[5] \nundertook to interpret Judaism as \u201ca philosophical\nreligion\u201d by giving principles of Judaism that appeared to be in\nconflict with philosophy naturalistic interpretations (for the concept\nof philosophical religion see Fraenkel 2012: 5). In a similar vein,\nAlbalag engages in allegorical interpretations of some elements of the\nAccount of the Beginning, stating, in an obviously apologetic tone,\nthat \u201cit is possible to extract the philosophical doctrine of\neternal creation from the Torah\u201d (Tiqqun n.30,\n33). \n\nOn the other hand, Albalag reveals ambivalence about the feasibility\nof the philosophical approach to religion. His main stated concern is\nthat the true meaning of Scripture is not readily accessible. The\nreason is that prophetic knowledge, as Albalag repeatedly affirms, is\nexclusive to prophets and even the ablest philosopher has no access to\nthe \u201cintention\u201d of the prophet. Thus, when philosophers\nassign philosophical meanings to verses of the Torah they may just be\nswerving away from their actual tenor. Albalag finds Maimonides to be\nparticularly at fault in this regard and therefore he labels him as\none of the \u201chasty\u201d people (nemharim) of our time\nwho did harm not only to \u201cfaith\u201d, but also to\n\u201cwisdom\u201d (Tiqqun n.1: 5; Tiqqun n.30:\n44). In their attempts to rationally support religious doctrines they\nacted \u201cwith ignorance\u201d as they \n\n denied demonstrative philosophical doctrines, advocating,\ninstead, weak speculative arguments, and \n unhesitatingly ascribed meanings to Scripture in terms of these\narguments and based on their understanding of Scripture. \n\n\nTwo points of contention seem to underlie this critique. The first is\nthat those \u201chasty\u201d people tend to compromise philosophy in\norder to satisfy theological considerations. The second is sceptical.\nWhile many philosophers confidently interpret Scripture allegorically\non the assumption that the internal meaning of Scripture accords with\nphilosophy, Albalag merges his interpretive notes on the Account of\nthe Beginning\u2014the sole context where he offers interpretations\nof that sort\u2014with remarks emphasizing the inaccessibility of\nprophetic knowledge to non-prophets.\n\nIn response, Albalag offers what may be characterized as a restrictive\nscheme for interpreting the Jewish Scripture in terms of philosophy.\nThis scheme regards demonstration as the means for attaining\nthe truth and Scripture as a divine source for the truth. Scripture\ncontains two layers of secrets: philosophical and prophetic. A\nphilosopher arrives at the former layer by engaging in allegorical\ninterpretation after he has obtained knowledge through demonstrative\nreasoning: \n\n\nfor one who seeks the truth, it is not proper [for him] to seek its\npremises from what he apprehends from Scripture by his own effort\nwithout primarily [engaging in] demonstrative reasoning. Rather, he\nhas to learn the truth first through demonstration and thereafter seek\nsupport from Scripture. (Tiqqun n.30: 37; cf. Averroes \nDecisive Treatise: 7) \n\n\nWhen Scripture does not agree with demonstrative knowledge, this\npoints to the presence of a deeper layer of secrets, prophetic secrets\nto which only a prophet has access. On this occasion, the disharmony\nbetween demonstrative and prophetic knowledge is treated with fideism,\nby accepting the Scriptural doctrine on the basis of simple faith. One\nshould not, however, abandon the demonstrative doctrine. Both\ndoctrines remain \u201ctrue\u201d (\u02beemet) to the\nphilosopher-believer.\n\nThese claims lie behind the attribution of the double truth doctrine\nto Albalag in modern scholarship. It should be noted, however, that\nthe scope of application of the double truth doctrine in the\nTiqqun is meagre, being limited to the tension between\nreligion and philosophy in regard to the issue of the origin of the\nworld. Towards the end of his discussion of this issue Albalag\ndeclares that he accepts as \u201ctrue\u201d both the philosophical\ndoctrine of eternal creation and the biblical doctrine of temporal\ncreation, the former based on analysis of \u201cnature\u201d and by\nmeans of \u201cdemonstration\u201d and the latter based on\n\u201cthe authority of the prophet by way of miracle\u201d\n(Tiqqun n.30: 52). This peculiar way of treating the question\nof the relationship between religion and philosophy draws a parting\nline between Albalag and the tradition of Arab Aristotelians and\nJewish Averroists in which religion and philosophy are held to be\nseemingly different representations of the same truth. \n",
