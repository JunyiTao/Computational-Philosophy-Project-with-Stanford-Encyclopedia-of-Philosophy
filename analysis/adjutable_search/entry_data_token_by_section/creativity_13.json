    "main_text": "The Cognitive Science of Creativity || Worries and future directions\n5.6 Worries and future directions\n\nWe close our survey of the cognitive science of creativity with a\nbrief discussion of some general worries about current work, and some\nprescriptions for future research.\n\nSome have worried about the validity of the psychometric measures\nemployed in neuroimaging studies. One such concern regards the\nconfidence that we should have that the tests employed are really\ntracking creative behavior. This is of course a general problem,\npartly symptomatic of the challenges that come with defining\ncreativity (like other phenomena) and with the special challenges that\nattach to features such as insight and incubation. But there are\nparticular challenges that come with using neuroimaging technologies\nsuch as fMRI scanning to attempt to study naturally occurring\nphenomena. Use of this technology is almost invariably ecologically\ninvalid\u2014one cannot run an fMRI in the artist\u2019s studio. And\nbecause of the cost and sensitivity of these imaging systems, the\ncorrelative behavioral tests are often significantly abbreviated. This\nmay impose constraints on space for occurrence of the target\nphenomena\u2014novel thinking and insight\u2014during the imaging\nsession. As one researcher worries,\n\n\nToo often single tests are used\u2014or even single items! This is\ncontrary of psychometric theory in general (where longer tests allow\nerrors to cancel themselves out and are thus more reliable) and true\nof the research on creativity assessment in particular, where\ndifferences among items and even tests are common (Richards, 1976;\nRunco, Mohamad, & Paek, 2016 [sic should be Runco, Abdulla et al.\n2016). Results from any one test will not generalize to other tests.\nResults from a single item of course have even less generalizability.\n(Runco 2017: 309\u2013310; see also Abraham 2013)\n\n\nAnother empirical researcher criticizes what he sees as \u201cthe\nwild goose chase\u201d in the neuroscience of creativity. Arne\nDietrich (2019) recapitulates the above worries about validity of\npsychometric measures and their abbreviated and piecemeal application.\nHe further worries about the now dominant emphasis on divergent\nthinking, and the default mode network (as well as the now mostly\nabandoned emphasis on notions such as madness, the right brain, and\nREM sleep). Dietrich\u2019s concern in each case is that the research\nemphasis is unhelpfully myopic, and that while the imaging methods are\nsound and state of the art, the characterization of creativity is not.\nHe decries the temptation to identify what may be a feature\nof creativity with the whole of the phenomenon. Divergent thinking, he\nsuggests, is likely a cluster of various mental phenomena rather than\na singular one, and\n\n\nthere is no effort underway to dissect divergent thinking and link it\nto the kinds of cognitive processes we use to operationalize all other\npsychological phenomena, such as working memory, cognitive control,\nsemantic memory, perceptual processes, or executive attention. (2019:\n37)\n\n\nNotice, then, that the \u201cwild goose\u201d for Dietrich is to\nhastily conclude and then center studies around a singular, special\ncreativity mechanism.\n\nDietrich also offers various prescriptions for remedy. To combat\nmyopia, he suggests (as some have in other disciplines, e.g., Boden\n2004) a plurality of types of creativity (and/or features of\ncreativity). He cautions,\n\n\nSince different types of creativity contain opposing brain\nmechanisms\u2014focused versus defocused attention, for\ninstance\u2014any all-encompassing claim about creativity in the\nbrain will almost certainly qualify as phrenology. (2019: 39)\n\n\nHe pairs this with a prescription for a more interdisciplinary\napproach to the topic. Others in the field have made the same\nprescription, advocating a \u201csystems\u201d approach sensitive\nboth to the multi-faceted nature of creativity and the value of\ntheorizing at multiple levels of explanation (Hennessy & Amabile\n2010).\n\nThese directives for future research seem hard to resist. At the very\nleast, it would seem advantageous to ensure that the full range of\nempirical method across the behavioral and brain sciences is\ncommunicated across the relevant sub-disciplines. This would ideally\nlead to better collaboration amongst such researchers. What\u2019s\ninteresting is that a cousin to this prescription is not well heeded\nby the same researchers advancing it here. However little crossover\nthere is between, say, behavioral psychologists and neuroscientists in\nstudies of creativity, there is comparatively even less crossover\n(almost none) between the psychological sciences and computational\napproaches to creativity. The next section thus begins by highlighting\nthis \u201cgap\u201d, and identifying some of the potentially\nfruitful areas for interdisciplinary work on that front. It then\ncontinues with a discussion, generally, of research on creativity in\nthe fields of computing science, artificial intelligence, and\nrobotics.\n",
