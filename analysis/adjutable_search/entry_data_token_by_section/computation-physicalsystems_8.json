    "main_text": "Is Every Physical System Computational? || Varieties of Pancomputationalism\n3.1 Varieties of Pancomputationalism\n\nVarieties of pancomputationalism vary along two dimensions. First,\nthey vary with respect to how many computations\u2014all,\nmany, a few, or just one\u2014they attribute to each system. We will\ncall this the quantitative dimension. Second, they vary with\nrespect to why these computations are attributable to physical\nsystems. We will call this the source dimension.\n\nThe weakest version of pancomputationalism along the quantitative\ndimension is that every physical system performs at least one\ncomputation (Scheutz 2001). This version may be called limited\npancomputationalism.\n\nThe strongest version of pancomputationalism is that every physical\nsystem performs every computation\u2014or at least, every\nsufficiently complex system implements a very large number of\nnon-equivalent computations (Putnam 1988, Searle 1992). This may be\ncalled unlimited pancomputationalism.\n\nOne purported source of pancomputationalism is that the computation(s)\na system performs is a matter of relatively free interpretation. If\nthe computation a system performs depends solely or primarily on how\nthe system is interpreted, as opposed to objective fact, then it seems\nthat everything computes because everything may be seen as computing\n(Searle 1992). This may be called interpretivist\npancomputationalism.\n\nAnother purported source of pancomputationalism is that computation is\nsimply the causal or dynamical structure of physical processes, as the\ncausal account of computation (Section 2.2) maintains (Chrisley 1995,\nChalmers 1995, 1996, Scheutz 1999, 2001). Assuming that everything has\ncausal structure, it follows that everything performs the computation\nconstituted by its causal structure. This may be called causal\npancomputationalism.\n\nA third purported source of pancomputationalism results from the idea\nthat every physical state carries information, coupled with an\ninformation-based semantics and a liberal version of the semantic view\nof computation. According to the semantic view of computation,\ncomputation is the manipulation of representations. According to\ninformation-based semantics, a representation is anything that carries\ninformation. Assuming that every physical state carries information,\nit follows that every physical system performs the computations\nconstituted by the manipulation of its information-carrying states\n(cf. Shagrir 2006).\n\nThe final purported source of pancomputationalism is that computation\nitself is the nature of the physical universe. According to some\nphysicists, the physical world is computational at its most\nfundamental level; this is sometimes put in slogan form as the\n\u201cit from bit\u201d view (Wheeler 1989). We will discuss this\nview further in Section 3.4.\n",
