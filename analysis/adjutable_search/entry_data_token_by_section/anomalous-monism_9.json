    "main_text": "Premise III: The Anomalism Principle\n4. Premise III: The Anomalism Principle\n\nThe anomalism principle states that there are no strict laws on the\nbasis of which mental events can predict, explain, or be predicted or\nexplained by other events. In this section we look at different\ninterpretations of the argument for this principle. Davidson\u2019s\nown formulations, while suggestive, are notoriously vague and often\nappeal to very different sorts of considerations, including aspects of\nlanguage and interpretation, questions about psychological\nexplanation, and the nature of causality and dispositions. We shall be\nlooking at specific interpretations as well as the problems they face\nin providing a compelling rationale for both the anomalism principle\nand Anomalous Monism.\n\nWhile differing in important ways, the various formulations of the\nargument, as well as the objections to them, exhibit a discernible\npattern: proponents of mental anomalism highlight some feature of\nmental properties that is claimed to (1) sharply individuate them from\nphysical properties and (2) create a conceptual tension with physical\nproperties that precludes the possibility of strict lawful relations\nbetween these properties. According to the objections, however, the\nhighlighted feature of mental properties either does not serve to\ndistinguish it from physical properties or does not actually stand in\nany conceptual tension with physical properties that rules out lawlike\nrelations. We will consider each interpretation, and its problems, in\nturn. In a later section\n (5.3)\n we will look at another objection related to the anomalism\nprinciple\u2014that it is inconsistent with Davidson\u2019s\ninvocation of the doctrine that mental properties stand in a relation\nof supervenience to physical properties. For discussion of the\nrelation between the anomalism principle and Davidson\u2019s views\nabout scheme-content dualism and semantic externalism, see the\nsupplement on\n Related Issues.\n\nMental anomalism, as initially formulated by Davidson, holds that\nthere can be no strict laws on the basis of which mental events can be\npredicted and explained (Davidson 1970, 208). It is thus restricted to\nruling out strict laws of succession with mental predicates occurring\nin the consequent\u2014laws such as\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019,\n\u2018(M1\u00a0&\u00a0P1)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M2\u2019,\nor\n\u2018M1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M2\u2019.\nIt thus denies that the occurrence of particular mental events such as\ncoming to believe or intend something, or intentionally acting in some\nway, can be explained by appeal to strict covering laws. But as\nbecomes clear, Davidson\u2019s considered position rejects the\npossibility of any strict laws in which mental predicates\nfigure\u2014and this includes, in particular, bridge laws of the form\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2194\u00a0M1\u2019,\nwhich form the basis of type-identity theories of mind, as well as any\nstrict laws with mental antecedents. We have already seen how strict\npurely psychological laws are ruled out by the interaction principle\n (2.3).\n And, at a more general level, it rules out purported solutions to the\nproblem of deviant causal chains noted in\n 2.2,\n which would spell out, in terms of some required physical and also,\nperhaps, mental conditions, how behavior must be caused by reasons\n(\u201ccaused in the right way\u201d) in order to be action. (That\nsome physical conditions are necessary in such an analysis is\nguaranteed, as we have seen\n (2.3),\n by the open nature of the mental and subsequent psychological\nanomalism.) Any such adequate analysis of action would entail\nparticular psychophysical laws of the form\n\u2018(M1\u00a0&\u00a0M2\u00a0&\u00a0M3\u00a0&\u00a0P1)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0P2\u2019.\nFor such an analysis would state that whatever behavior\n(P2) which in fact is caused in the right way\n(M3\u00a0&\u00a0P1) by\nreasons\n(M1\u00a0&\u00a0M2) would\nbe the action that is rationalized by those reasons. This\nprovides a schema for generating strict psychophysical laws: by\nplugging in particular reasons and the causal conditions\nP1 and M3 proffered by the\nanalysis, we get a strict predictive psychophysical law simply by\nnoting what effect is produced by these causes. (In the course of an\nextended discussion of the problem of deviant causal chains, Bishop\n1989, 125\u201375, fails to see this connection between it and mental\nanomalism\u2014see 164.) With strict purely psychological laws thus\nalready ruled out, the focus now is on strict psychophysical laws.\n\nIt is useful to view Davidson\u2019s attack against psychophysical\nlaws in light of an argument, in vogue in the 1950s and 1960s, against\nthe claim that reasons are causes of the actions they explain. This\nargument was referred to as the \u201cLogical Connection\nArgument\u201d (see Stoutland 1970). According to this argument,\nreasons cannot be held to explain actions by causing them because (1)\ncauses and effects must be logically distinct from each other (one of\nHume\u2019s requirements on causality) but (2) reasons and the\nactions they explain bear a quasi-logical connection to each other, by\nvirtue of the rationalizing relation between them. That relationship\nis quasi-logical because not just any reason can explain any\naction\u2014only those reasons which actually rationalize (make\nintelligible) an action can explain it. Davidson\u2019s own\ninfluential response to this argument was to distinguish between\ncausal relations, which obtain between events no matter how they are\ndescribed, and logical relations, which obtain between particular\ndescriptions of events. The Logical Connection Argument fails to\nrecognize this simple distinction. The distinction allowed Davidson to\nmerge two key ideas in his theory of action\u2014that reasons explain\nby causing, and that they explain by rationalizing (Davidson 1963,\n13\u201317). As we shall see below, however, Davidson appears to\naccept a basic distinction at the heart of the Logical Connection\nArgument\u2014that the rationalizing relationship bears a certain key\nproperty (quasi-logical status) that is at odds with the relationship\nbetween physically described, causally related events.\n",
