    "main_text": "Second Kind of Position in Feminist Environmental Philosophy: Ecofeminist Philosophy || Political Perspectives\n3.7 Political Perspectives\nFeminist political philosophy critiques ways in which traditional\nunderstandings of the political world, including the nature of the\npublic sphere, freedom, democracy, political speech, solidarity, and\nparticipation, fail to adequately address feminist concerns (see entry\non \n feminist political philosophy).\n Ecofeminist political philosophy tends to\nexpand these critiques to include ecologically informed visions for\nconceptualizing politics, political analyses, and the nature of\ndemocracy.  \nDuring the 1980s, women's activism in a variety of social\nmovements\u2014the environmental, peace, animal liberation, and\nenvironmental justice movements\u2014came together and a new form of\nactivism emerged, ecofeminist political activism. By the\n1990s, this political activism had given rise to a diversity of\necofeminisms: liberal, Marxist, socialist, radical,\ncultural/spiritual, and social ecofeminisms. These different\necofeminisms are mentioned here because each is grounded in a\ndifferent ecofeminist political perspective\u2014liberalism, Marxism,\nsocialism, radical feminism, indigenous and spiritual politics,\nanarchism, and social ecology. And each political perspective provides\na different answer to questions about the nature of ecofeminist\nactivism, green politics, and ecofeminism political philosophy.\nAriel Salleh, for example, claims that the basic premise of ecofeminist political\nanalysis is that the ecological crisis\n\n\n is the inevitable effect of a Eurocentric capitalist\npatriarchal culture built on the domination of nature, and domination\nof Woman \u2018as nature\u2019. Or, to turn the\u2026equation\naround the other way, it is the inevitable effect of a culture\nconstructed on the domination of women, and the domination of Nature,\n\u2018as feminine\u2019. (Salleh 1997: 12\u201313)\nCatriona Sandilands' ecofeminist political perspective starts with\n\n the premise that ecofeminism contains an inherently\ndemocratic vision\u2026[that] needs to be located in the context of\ncontemporary democratic theory. (Sandilands 1999: xvii)\n\n\nSandilands argues that traditional understandings of democracy, the\npublic sphere, political speech, and coalition-building fail to\nadequately address the need for an ecologically informed democratic\npolitics\u2014 an \u201cecological democracy\u201d. For both Salleh\nand Sandilands, ecofeminist political analysis is not \u201cpolitics\nas usual\u201d; it is a gendered, ecologically informed perspective\nthat uses its understanding of the unjustified dominations of women,\nanimals and nature to reconceive notions of the public sphere,\ndemocracy, citizenship, and free speech. \nDeane Curtin (1999) agrees that the environmental crisis is a\ncrisis of citizenship and of traditional democracy. Unlike the sense\nof \u201cdemocracy\u201d that refers to culturally specific\ninstitutions created by Western liberalism, a feminist informed\n\u201cecological democracy\u201d refers to a vision of democracy\nthat recognizes that we all live in both cultural and ecological\ncommunities\u2014in familiar, enduring, socially diverse\nrelationships to people and places, culture and nature. Ecological\ncommunities are democratic when they are committed to reconciling\nculture with nature in ways appropriate to what it is to be an\necological citizen\u2014one who exercises civic virtues that foster\nthe health of all humans and the planet (see also Katherine Pettus\n1997; Sherilyn MacGregor 2004).\nThere is a very different sort of ecofeminist political philosophy\nthat is developing within Continental philosophy and phenomenology. It\nadvances views of nature as a subject with agency, subjectivity,\n\u201cvoice\u201d, and the ability to enter into political dialogue\nas co-interlocutor with humans. This approach to ecofeminist political\ntheory deserves to be acknowledged, though it is not discussed further\nhere (see Patricia Glazebrook 2001, 2008; Chaone Mallory 2008;\nSandilands 1999, 2002).\n",
