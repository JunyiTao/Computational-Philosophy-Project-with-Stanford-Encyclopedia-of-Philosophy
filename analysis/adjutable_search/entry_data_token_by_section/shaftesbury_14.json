    "main_text": "Innate Ideas\n6. Innate Ideas\n\nShaftesbury resists Locke\u2019s attack on innate ideas, particularly\nas it applies to morality. Shaftesbury maintains that the \u201cmain\nscope and principal end\u201d of Characteristicks is\n\u201cto assert the Reality of a Beauty and\nCharm in moral as well as\nnatural Subjects\u201d (C 3.303), and he believes that\nLocke\u2019s rejection of innate ideas undermines that moral reality.\nLocke\u2019s rejection of innate ideas, as Shaftesbury sees it,\nimplies that our moral ideas must be nothing but the result of custom\nand instruction, and that they are therefore relative to the\ncontingent events of each person\u2019s own society and upbringing.\nBut morality, if it exists, must be based in a uniform nature.\nMorality is natural or it is nothing at all. And Locke\u2019s\nrejection of innate ideas implies that morality is not natural. (For\ndiscussion of Shaftesbury\u2019s attack on Locke\u2019s view of\ninnate ideas, see Carey 2006, 98\u201399; Uehlein 2017; and\nStuart\u2013Buttle 2019: 90\u2013102. Stuart-Buttle responds to\nSpellman (1998: 201), who argues that Shaftesbury badly misinterprets\nLocke.)\n\nBecause the word \u2018innate\u2019 is ambiguous and controversial,\nShaftesbury chooses to affirm the naturalness of morality in other\nterms (C 2.411\u201312). \u201cImplanted\u201d is a word he uses\noften, contending that a \u201csense of Right and Wrong\u201d (C\n2.60), a \u201cPrinciple of Virtue\u201d (C 2.38), and\n\u201coriginal ideas of goodness\u201d (C 1.33) are\nimplanted in every human. He also speaks of our\n\u201cPre-conceptions, or Pre-sensations\u201d of morality, which\nare ideas, principles, and affections that possess moral content but\ndo not originate in experience (C 2.412\u20133; see also 2.307;\n2.25\u20136). Another word he uses to express his opposition to\nLocke\u2019s anti-nativism is \u2018anticipation,\u2019 as when he\nwrites,\n\n\n[W]e cannot resist our natural Anticipation in behalf of Nature;\naccording to whose suppos\u2019d\nStandard we perpetually approve and disapprove, and to whom\nin all natural Appearances, all moral Actions (whatever we\ncontemplate, whatever we have in debate) we inevitably appeal. (C\n3.214; see also 2.45, 2.412; 2.420; 3.214)\n\n\nHis point here is that we base our moral judgments on a standard that\nwe recognize prior to (or in anticipation of) any of our particular\nexperiences. Similarly, he says that we have a\n\u201cPrepossession of the Mind, in favour of this moral\nDistinction\u201d (C 2.44). The distinction that is important to\nShaftesbury is between aspects of human life that are based in\ninstincts or natural tendencies, and aspects that result from\nartifice, culture, and instruction (C 2.411). Shaftesbury\u2019s main\ncontention is that many morally significant aspects of human life fall\nin into the first category rather than the second. We naturally care\nfor children. We naturally seek company and prefer sociability to\nsolitariness. We naturally form groups bound by \u201cLove of a\ncommon City, Community, or Country\u201d (C 2.308\u20139). We\nnaturally find some types of conduct beautiful and virtuous, and\nothers not so.\n\nBut while Shaftesbury claims that all humans naturally (or\ninstinctively) possess (or are imprinted with) a sense of right and\nwrong (a principle of virtue, original ideas of goodness), he also\nbelieves that a great deal of cultivation and refinement is necessary\nin order to develop correct and proper judgment (C 1.190\u20131).\nVirtue and good taste may be natural, but it turns out that a proper\neducation is needed for most people to achieve them. How can\nShaftesbury both insist on the naturalness of morality and beauty, and\ncontend for the need of intensive critical moral and aesthetic\nreflection? Carey has argued that Shaftesbury believes this apparent\nproblem can be dissolved by the Stoic concept of prolepsis\n(Carey 2006: 110\u2013116). Prolepses are notions that do \u201cnot\ndepend on or derive from instruction or experience\u201d (Carey 2006:\n112). But prolepses are merely mental anticipations, not fully formed\nconcepts\u2014they are pre\u2013conceptions\u2014and as\nsuch they can be poorly developed and misapplied. To give prolepses\ntheir most complete form and to apply them properly, practice and\ncultivation are necessary. Shaftesbury can thus hold that ethics\nrequires the \u201cright application of the Affections\u201d (C\n2.35), and he can attribute mistaken ethical judgments to a\n\u201cDefect in the application of that unavoidable\nImpression and first natural Rule of Honesty and\nWorth\u201d (C 3.303\u20134).\n",
