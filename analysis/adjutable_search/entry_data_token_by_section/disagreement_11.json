    "main_text": "Disagreement By the Numbers\n7. Disagreement and Skepticism\n\n\nSo, the phenomenon of disagreement supplies a skeptical\nthreat: for many of our cherished beliefs. If we aren\u2019t\nsheltered, then we know that there is a great deal of controversy\nabout those beliefs even among the people who are the smartest and\nhave worked the hardest in trying to figure out the truth of the\nmatter.  There is good reason to think that retaining a belief in the\nface of that kind of controversy is irrational, and a belief that is\nirrational does not amount to knowledge. It follows that our beliefs\nwe recognize as controversial do not amount to knowledge. This is the\nthreat of disagreement skepticism (Frances 2018, 2013, 2005;\nChristensen 2009; Fumerton 2010; Goldberg 2009, 2013b; Kornblith 2010,\n2013; Lammenranta 2011, 2013; Machuca 2013).\n\n\nFor the sake of argument, we can assume that our controversial\nbeliefs start out epistemically rational. Roughly put, the\ndisagreement skeptic thinks that even if a controversial belief starts\nout as rational, once one appreciates the surrounding controversy,\none\u2019s belief will no longer be rational, and thus not an item of\nknowledge. The disagreement skeptic focuses on beliefs that satisfy\nthe following recognition-of-controversy conditions.\n\n\nYou know that the belief \\(B\\) in question has been investigated and\ndebated (i) for a very long time by (ii) a great many (iii) very smart\npeople who (iv) are your epistemic peers and superiors on the matter\nand (v) have worked very hard (vi) under optimal circumstances to\nfigure out if \\(B\\) is true. But you also know that (vii) these\nexperts have not come to any significant agreement on \\(B\\) and (viii)\nthose who agree with you are not, as a group, in an appreciably better\nposition to judge \\(B\\) than those who disagree with you.\n\n\nNotice that the problem does not emerge from a mere lack of\nconsensus. Very few, if any, beliefs are disagreement-free. Rather,\nthe skeptical threat comes from both the extent of the disagreement\n(conditions (i) and (ii)) and the nature of the disagreeing parties\n(conditions (iii) \u2013 (viii)). While not every belief meets these\nrecognition-of-controversy conditions, many do, and among those that\ndo are some of our most cherished beliefs.\n\n\nFor instance, I might have some opinion regarding the nature of free\nwill or the moral permissibility of capital punishment or whether God\nexists. I know full well that these matters have been debated by an\nenormous number of really smart people for a very long time\u2014in\nsome cases, for centuries. I also know that I\u2019m no expert on any\nof these topics. I also know that there are genuine experts on those\ntopics\u2014at least, they have thought about those topics\nmuch longer than I have, with a great deal more awareness of\nrelevant considerations, etc. It\u2019s no contest: I know I\u2019m\njust an amateur compared to them. Part of being reflective is coming to\nknow about your comparative epistemic status on controversial subjects.\nThat said, being an expert in the relevant field doesn\u2019t remove\nthe problem either. Even if I am an expert on free will, I am aware\nthat there are many other such experts, that I am but one such voice\namong many, and that disagreement is rampant amongst us.\n\n\nThe person who knows (i)\u2013(viii) is robbed of the reasonableness\nof several comforting responses to the discovery of controversy. If\nshe is reasonable, then she realizes that she can\u2019t make, at\nleast with confidence, anything like the following remarks:\n\nWell, the people who agree with me are smarter than the people who\ndisagree with me.\nWe have crucial evidence they don\u2019t have.\nWe have studied the key issue a great deal more than they\nhave.\nThey are a lot more biased than we are.\n\n\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly prevalent with regard to religion,\npolitics, morality, and philosophy. If when it comes to debates about\nfree will, capital punishment, affirmative action, and many other\nstandard controversial topics you say to yourself regarding the\nexperts who disagree with you \u2018Those people just don\u2019t\nunderstand the issues\u2019, \u2018They aren\u2019t very\nsmart\u2019, \u2018They haven\u2019t thought about it much\u2019,\net cetera, then you are doing so irrationally in the sense\nthat you should know better than to say that, at least if\nyou\u2019re honest with yourself and informed of the state of the\ndebate over free will.\n\n\nHowever, connection between controversy and skepticism won\u2019t\napply to many of our other beliefs. No one (or no one you know) is\ngoing around saying your parents don\u2019t love you, you\naren\u2019t a basically moral person, etc. So those beliefs are\nprobably immune to any skeptical argument of the form \u2018There is\nlong-standing disagreement among experts regarding your belief \\(B\\);\nyou know all about it (viz. conditions (i)\u2013(viii)); you have no\ngood reason to discount the ones who disagree with you; so, you\nshouldn\u2019t retain your belief \\(B\\)\u2019. This is not to say\nthat those beliefs escape all skeptical arguments based on human error\nand related phenomena. But, the first thing to note about disagreement\nskepticism is that it is contained. Only beliefs that meet\nsomething like the recognition-of-controversy conditions are subject\nto this skeptical threat. Interestingly, however, it is not itself\nexempt from these skeptical consequences. Such views of disagreement\nare themselves quite controversial, so here too is another place where\nthe self-defeat worry arises.\n\n\nDisagreement skepticism is also contingent. The nature and\nextent of disagreements are both contingent matters, so since\ndisagreement skepticism relies on these factors, the skeptical\nconsequences of disagreement are also contingent. At one point in time\nthe shape of the Earth was quite contentious. While there is not now\nuniversal agreement that the Earth is roughly spherical, the\nrecognition-of-controversy conditions are no longer met on this matter.\nSimilarly, issues of great current controversy may too at some point\nfail to meet the recognition-of-controversy conditions. So, the\nskeptical threat from disagreement can come and go. That said, the\ntrack-record for the staying power of various philosophical\ndisagreements strongly indicates that they aren\u2019t going anywhere\nanytime soon.\n\n\nFinally, disagreement skepticism is exclusively epistemic. At issue\nhere has solely been one\u2019s epistemic reasons for holding a\nbelief. Meeting the recognition-of-controversy conditions raises a\nproblem for these reasons, but we haven\u2019t said anything about\nwhat moral, prudential, or even religious reasons you may have for\nholding a controversial belief. The skeptical threat from disagreement\nonly concerns our epistemic reasons. Relatedly, if there is an\nall-things-considered norm of belief, disagreement skepticism may have\nsome implications for this norm, but only by way of addressing the\nepistemic reasons that one has for belief.\n\n\nA related point is that these consequences are doxastic\nconsequences. Disagreement skepticism is about what beliefs are/are\nnot rational and which changes in confidence are/are not rational.\nDisagreement skepticism is not a view about which views should be\ndefended or what theses should be further researched. When coupled\nwith the knowledge norm of assertion or the knowledge norm of action,\ndisagreement skepticism would have further consequences about what\nclaims can be asserted or acted upon, but these consequences only\nfollow from such a combination of views.\n",
