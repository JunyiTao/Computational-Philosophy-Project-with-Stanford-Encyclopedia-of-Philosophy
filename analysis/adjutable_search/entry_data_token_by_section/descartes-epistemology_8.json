    "main_text": "First Meditation Doubting Arguments || Evil Genius Doubt\n3.2 Evil Genius Doubt\n\nThough dreaming doubts do significant demolition work, they are\nlight-duty bulldozers relative to Descartes\u2019 most power\nsceptical doubt. What further judgments are left to be undermined?\nImmediately after the discussion of dreaming, the meditator\ntentatively concludes that the results of empirical disciplines \n\u201care doubtful\u201d \u2013 e.g., \u201cphysics, astronomy,\nmedicine,\u201d and the like. Whereas:\n\n[A]rithmetic, geometry and other subjects of this kind, which deal\nonly with the simplest and most general things, regardless of whether\nthey really exist in nature or not, contain something certain and\nindubitable. For whether I am awake or asleep, two and three added\ntogether are five, and a square has no more than four sides. It seems\nimpossible that such transparent truths should incur any suspicion of\nbeing false. (Med. 1, AT 7:20, CSM 2:14)\n\n\nEarly in the Third Meditation, it emerges that even truths this\n\u201csimple and straightforward\u201d are subject to hyperbolic\ndoubt (AT 7:35f, CSM 2:25). And immediately following the above First\nMeditation passage, Descartes introduces his most hyperbolic doubt\n\u2013 the hypothesis of an all-powerful deceiver.\n\nThere is variation in the interpretation of the doubt, even\nconcerning the number of deceivers Descartes means to be citing. \nHowever, I suggest that there is a very natural reading that provides \nfor a unified understanding of a single deceiver hypothesis.\n\nThe passage initially introducing a deceiver represents the\nmeditator as having long believed in a creator who is both\nall-powerful and all-good. It seems to follow (so the meditator \nreasons) that a creator with these attributes would not allow its \ncreatures to be deceived about the existence of the external world,\nnor about such transparent truths as that 2+3=5. But likewise,\nneither should a creator with these attributes allow its creatures \never to be deceived. Yet we are sometimes\ndeceived. Since even occasional deception seems to pose a \nreductio on the very existence of an all-powerful,\nall-good creator, the implication is that the creator (if there\nbe one) must be lacking in either power or goodness. Suppose the \ncreator is all-powerful but not all-good \u2013 i.e., an \n\u201cevil genius\u201d of sorts. In that case, it seems we might\nbe deceived about even the most evident of matters.\n\nNotice that this foregoing understanding allows us to read the \nfollowing two passages as referring to the very same sceptical\nscenario \u2013 namely, a worry about a deceiver who\u2019s all-powerful, but not all-good:\n\n\nAnd yet firmly rooted in my mind is the long-standing opinion that\nthere is an omnipotent God who made me the kind of creature that I am.\nHow do I know that he has not brought it about that there is no earth,\nno sky, no extended thing, no shape, no size, no place, while at the\nsame time ensuring that all these things appear to me to exist just as\nthey do now? What is more, since I sometimes believe that others go\nastray in cases where they think they have the most perfect knowledge,\nmay I not similarly go wrong every time I add two and three or count\nthe sides of a square, or in some even simpler matter, if that is\nimaginable? But perhaps God would not have allowed me to be deceived\nin this way, since he is said to be supremely good. But if it were\ninconsistent with his goodness to have created me such that I am\ndeceived all the time, it would seem equally foreign to his goodness\nto allow me to be deceived even occasionally; yet this last assertion\ncannot be made. (AT 7:21, CSM 2:14)\n\nI will suppose therefore that not God, who is supremely good and the\nsource of truth, but rather some malicious demon [mauvais\ng\u00e9nie] of the utmost power and cunning has employed all\nhis energies in order to deceive me. (AT 7:21, CSM 2:15)\n\n\nSome commentators take these passages to introduce two separate\ndeceivers \u2013 a deceiving God, on the one hand, and an evil\ngenius (mauvais g\u00e9nie), on the other hand (cf. \nGouhier 1937, 163). Yet this seems to introduce needless\ncomplication without sufficient textual justification. The\ndeceptions of both deceivers are said to derive from having\nsupreme power, while (unlike the true God) lacking in goodness.\nAnd note that Descartes expresses ambivalence as to whether even\nto refer to a deceiver as \u2018God\u2019: while invoking\nhyperbolic doubt, the Second Meditation references the deceiver\nas \u201ca God, or whatever I may call him\u201d (AT 7:24,\nCSM 2:16). In any case, a single deceiver hypothesis will\nhereafter be assumed, referring to it by its popular designation,\nthe \u2018Evil Genius Doubt\u2019.\n\nIt is tempting to assume that the Evil Genius Doubt draws its\nsceptical force from the \u201cutmost power\u201d attributed to the\ndeceiver. Clear texts suggest a different reading. Descartes contends\nthat an equally powerful doubt derives from the supposition that we\nare not the creatures of an all-powerful creator. Recall that the\nabove reductio reasoning implies simply that the creator\ncannot be both all-powerful and all-good. Suppose, then, that we\ngive-up the assumption that the creator is all-powerful. The passage\ncontinues \u2013 while denying that the doubt is thereby weakened:\n\nPerhaps there may be some who would prefer to deny the existence of so\npowerful a God rather than believe that everything else is uncertain.\n\u2026 yet since deception and error seem to be imperfections, the\nless powerful they make my original cause, the more likely it is that\nI am so imperfect as to be deceived all the time. (AT 7:21, CSM 2:14)\n\n\nDescartes makes the same point in a parallel passage of the \nPrinciples:\n\n[W]e have been told that there is an omnipotent God who created us.\nNow we do not know whether he may have wished to make us beings of the\nsort who are always deceived even in those matters which seem to us\nsupremely evident \u2026 We may of course suppose that our existence\nderives not from a supremely powerful God but either from ourselves or\nfrom some other source; but in that case, the less powerful we make\nthe author of our coming into being, the more likely it will be that\nwe are so imperfect as to be deceived all the time. (Prin.\n1:5, AT 8a:6, CSM 1:194)\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 official position is that the Evil Genius Doubt is\nmerely one among multiple hypotheses that can motivate the more\ngeneral hyperbolic doubt. (See Cunning 2014, 68ff, and Hatfield 2006,\n126, for variations on this theme.) Fundamentally, the more general\ndoubt is about our cognitive nature, that is, about the\npossibility that our minds are flawed. The First Meditation texts\nare somewhat ambiguous on this count. But later passages are very\nclear\n(a theme we\u2019ll develop more fully in\n Section 4.3).\n\nWhat is essential to the doubt is not the specific story about the\norigin of our cognitive wiring; it\u2019s instead the realization\n\u2013 regardless the story \u2013 that for all we know, our\ncognitive wiring is flawed. Even so, I regularly speak in terms of the\nevil genius (following Descartes\u2019 lead), as a kind of\nmnemonic for the more general doubt about our cognitive nature.\n\nHaving introduced the Evil Genius Doubt, the First Meditation program\nof demolition is not only hyperbolic but universal.\nAs the meditator remarks, I \u201cam finally compelled to admit that\nthere is not one of my former beliefs about which a doubt may not\nproperly be raised\u201d (Med. 1, AT 7:21, CSM 2:14f). As will\nemerge, the early paragraphs of the Third Meditation clarify a further\nnuance of the Evil Genius Doubt \u2013 a nuance consistently observed\nthereafter. Descartes clarifies, there, that the Evil Genius Doubt\noperates in an indirect manner (a topic to which we return in\n Section 4.3).\n\n(For examples of alternative interpretations of the Evil Genius Doubt, \nsee Gewirth 1941 and Wilson 1978.)\n",
