    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein on Mathematics: Some Preliminaries || Wittgenstein on G\u00f6del and Undecidable Mathematical Propositions\n4. The Impact of Philosophy of Mathematics on Mathematics\n\nThough it is doubtful that all commentators will agree (Wrigley 1977:\n51; Baker & Hacker 1985: 345; Floyd 1991: 145, 143; 1995: 376;\n2005: 80; Maddy 1993: 55; Steiner 1996: 202\u2013204), the following\npassage seems to capture Wittgenstein\u2019s attitude to the\nPhilosophy of Mathematics and, in large part, the way in which he\nviewed his own work on mathematics.\n\n\nWhat will distinguish the mathematicians of the future from those of\ntoday will really be a greater sensitivity, and that\nwill\u2014as it were\u2014prune mathematics; since people will then\nbe more intent on absolute clarity than on the discovery of new\ngames.\n\nPhilosophical clarity will have the same effect on the growth of\nmathematics as sunlight has on the growth of potato shoots. (In a dark\ncellar they grow yards long.)\n\nA mathematician is bound to be horrified by my mathematical comments,\nsince he has always been trained to avoid indulging in thoughts and\ndoubts of the kind I develop. He has learned to regard them as\nsomething contemptible and\u2026 he has acquired a revulsion from\nthem as infantile. That is to say, I trot out all the problems that a\nchild learning arithmetic, etc., finds difficult, the problems that\neducation represses without solving. I say to those repressed doubts:\nyou are quite correct, go on asking, demand clarification!\n(PG 381, 1932)\n\n\nIn his middle and later periods, Wittgenstein believes he is providing\nphilosophical clarity on aspects and parts of mathematics, on\nmathematical conceptions, and on philosophical conceptions of\nmathematics. Lacking such clarity and not aiming for absolute clarity,\nmathematicians construct new games, sometimes because of a\nmisconception of the meaning of their mathematical\npropositions and mathematical terms. Education and especially advanced\neducation in mathematics does not encourage clarity but rather\nrepresses it\u2014questions that deserve answers are either not asked\nor are dismissed. Mathematicians of the future, however, will be more\nsensitive and this will (repeatedly) prune mathematical extensions and\ninventions, since mathematicians will come to recognize that new\nextensions and creations (e.g., propositions of transfinite cardinal\narithmetic) are not well-connected with the solid core of mathematics\nor with real-world applications. Philosophical clarity will,\neventually, enable mathematicians and philosophers to \u201cget down\nto brass tacks\u201d (PG 467).\n",
