    "main_text": "From Possible Worlds to Structured Propositions\n2. From Possible Worlds to Structured Propositions\n\nBecause the structured proposition view arose in large part due to\ndissatisfaction with the then prevailing view of propositions,\ndiscussing this other account of propositions will help to illuminate\nstructured proposition views. The late 1950s and 1960s saw the\ndevelopment of a new sort of model theory, \u201cpossible worlds\nsemantics\u201d, for systems of modal logic. In the framework of\npossible world semantics, linguistic expressions are assigned\nextensions \u201cat\u201d possible worlds. Thus, e.g. names, n-place\npredicates and sentences are assigned individuals, sets of\nn-tuples of individuals, and truth values, respectively, at\ndifferent possible worlds. Intuitively, possible worlds are to be\nthought of as \u201cways things could have been\u201d, and the\nassignment of (possibly different) extensions to expressions at\ndifferent possible worlds is part of capturing this intuition. Thus\nthere might have been more or fewer cows, and this is reflected in the\nfact that the extension of \u2018cow\u2019 (intuitively, the set of\nthings that are cows) can vary from possible world to possible\nworld.\n\nBecause we wish the extensions of expressions to vary from possible\nworld to possible world (at least in some cases), it is natural to\nassociate with each expression a function from possible worlds to\nextensions appropriate to that sort of expression. Thus we associate\nwith names, functions from possible worlds to individuals; with\nn-place predicates functions from possible worlds to sets of\nn-tuples; and with sentences, functions from possible worlds to\ntruth values. Such functions from possible worlds to extensions of the\nappropriate sort are often called intensions of the expressions in\nquestion, and the term \u2018intension\u2019 shall be used this way\nthroughout the present\n work.[5]\n Now since most think that the extensions of sentences are truth\nvalues, as indicated above, the intension of a sentence is a function\nfrom possible worlds to truth values. Intuitively, it maps a world to\ntrue if the sentence is true at that world. Thus the intension of a\nsentence can be seen as the primary bearer of truth and falsity at a\nworld: the sentence has the truth value it has at the world in virtue\nof its intension mapping that world to that truth value. Further,\nmodal operators were typically construed as operating on the\nintensions of the sentences they embed, and so those intensions could\nplausibly be thought of as possessing modal properties. Since\npropositions were traditionally held to be the primary bearers of\ntruth and falsity and the bearers of modal properties, it was natural\nfor possible world semanticists to identify propositions with\nfunctions from possible worlds to truth values (sentential\nintensions), or equivalently, sets of possible worlds (the set of\npossible worlds at which the sentence in question is true). Indeed,\nthis identification was thought by many to vindicate the previously\nmysterious notion of a\n proposition.[6]\n Possible worlds were apparently needed for the model theory of modal\nlogic anyway; why not build propositions out of them?\n\nCurrent structured proposition accounts arose largely out of\ndissatisfaction with the idea that propositions are sets of possible\nworlds (or functions from worlds to truth values). In fact, there were\nat least two quite distinct motivations for abandoning the view of\npropositions as sets of worlds and adopting the structured proposition\naccount.\n\nThe first had to do with the way propositions are individuated on a\npossible worlds account. The view that propositions are sets of\npossible worlds does not individuate propositions very finely. For\nexample, consider any pair of sentences that express metaphysically\nnecessary propositions, say \u2018Bachelors are unmarried\u2019 and\n\u2018Brothers are male siblings\u2019. Since these propositions are\ntrue in all possible worlds, each must be the set of all possible\nworlds. But there is only one such set. Thus there is only one such\nproposition! Hence these two sentences express the same proposition.\n(The view also predicts that all true sentences of mathematics express\nthe same (necessary) proposition, that any two necessarily equivalent\nsentences express the same proposition, that the conjunction of any\nsentence S with a necessarily true sentence expresses the same\nproposition as S, and so on.)\n\nThis should make clear that the account of propositions as sets of\nworlds is not a structured proposition account. For, as we saw, on a\nstructured proposition account, the semantic values of expressions in\na sentence are recoverable from the proposition expressed by the\nsentence, since those semantic values are constituents of the\nproposition. This is why on such an account, \u2018Bachelors are\nunmarried males\u2019 and \u2018Brothers are male siblings\u2019\nexpress distinct propositions: the propositions have different\nconstituents. But on the possible worlds account, the property of\nbeing a bachelor is in no sense recoverable from or a constituent of\nthe proposition expressed by \u2018Bachelors are unmarried\u2019.\nFor the latter proposition is just the set of all possible worlds. How\ncould the property of being a bachelor be \u201crecovered\u201d from\nthis set? Similarly, the property of being a brother is not\nrecoverable from the proposition expressed by \u2018Brothers are male\nsiblings.\u2019 Again, the latter proposition is just the set of all\npossible worlds.\n\nFurther, if propositions are sets of possible worlds, belief is\nconstrued as a relation between individuals and propositions and\nsentences of the form \u2018A believes that P\u2019\nassert that the individual A stands in the belief relation to\nthe proposition expressed by \u2018P\u2019, then for any\nnecessarily equivalent sentences \u2018P\u2019 and\n\u2018Q\u2019, \u2018A believes that P\u2019\nand \u2018A believes that Q\u2019 cannot differ in\ntruth value. This means that, for example, if \u2018A believes\nthat 1+1=2\u2019 is true, so is \u2018A believes that there\nis no greatest natural number\u2019. These consequences of the view\nthat propositions are sets of possible worlds were appreciated early\non; and theorists made a variety of attempts to make these\nconsequences seem less unpalatable. Despite these valiant efforts,\nmany philosophers viewed these consequences as a sign that there was\nsomething very wrong with the view that propositions are sets of\npossible worlds. Thus, philosophers were open to an account of\npropositions that individuated propositions more finely than the\npossible worlds account. As we have seen, the structured proposition\naccount is just such an account.\n\nIn order to make clear the second motivation for abandoning the view\nof propositions as sets of worlds and adopting the structured\nproposition account, we must discuss the notions of rigid designation\nand direct reference. A rigid designator is an expression that\ndesignates the same individual in all possible circumstances or\nworlds. In the early 1970\u2019s, Saul Kripke argued in Naming and\nNecessity that ordinary proper names are rigid designators. Kripke\nclaimed that when we consider a sentence containing an ordinary proper\nname, such as\n\nAristotle was a great philosopher\n\nand ask whether it would have been true or false in various\ncounterfactual circumstances, it is the properties of the very same\nman, Aristotle, in those circumstances that are relevant to the truth\nof the sentence. So, \u2018Aristotle\u2019 designates the same man\nin these various counterfactual circumstances; it is a rigid\ndesignator.\n\nAt around the same time, David Kaplan argued that indexicals (e.g.\n\u2018I\u2019, \u2018here\u2019, \u2018now\u2019) and\ndemonstratives (e.g. \u2018that\u2019, \u2018you\u2019,\n\u2018he\u2019) are directly referential. Concerning directly\nreferential expressions, Kaplan wrote:\n\nFor me, the intuitive idea is not that of an expression which turns\nout to designate the same object in all possible circumstances, but an\nexpression whose semantical rules provide directly that the referent\nin all possible circumstances is fixed to be the actual referent. In\ntypical cases the semantical rules will do this only implicitly, by\nproviding a way of determining the actual referent, and no way of\ndetermining any other propositional component. (Kaplan [1977] p. 493)\n\n\nThus, a directly referential expression is a rigid designator: its\nassociated semantic rules determine the actual referent of the\nexpression (in a context) and when evaluating what is said by the\nsentence containing the expression (in that context) in other possible\ncircumstances, this same referent is always relevant. To illustrate,\nif John utters\n\nI ski.\n\nat the present time and we want to evaluate whether what John said by\nmeans of that utterance is true or false in other possible\ncircumstances, it is John\u2019s properties in those other\ncircumstances that are relevant. Thus, \u2018I\u2019 is rigid: when\nevaluating the truth or falsity of what is said by an utterance of a\nsentence containing \u2018I\u2019 in counterfactual circumstances,\nit is the properties of the person whom \u2018I\u2019 referred to in\nthe utterance (the actual utterer) that are relevant.\n\nKaplan intended to contrast directly referential expressions with\nexpressions such as definite descriptions, which, though designating\nparticular individuals, do so by means of descriptive conditions being\nexpressed by the description and satisfied by the designated\nindividual. Thus Kaplan wrote that directly referential expressions\n\u201crefer directly without the mediation of Fregean Sinn as\nmeaning\u201d. (Kaplan [1977] p. 483) The designation of definite\ndescriptions is mediated by something like a Fregean sense (i.e. their\nassociated descriptive conditions).\n\nOf course, even if descriptions are not directly referential, some are\nrigid designators. For example, \u2018the successor of 1\u2019\ndesignates the same individual (2) in all possible worlds. So, though\nall directly referential expressions are rigid designators, some rigid\ndesignators are not directly referential. As was mentioned above, in a\npossible worlds semantics linguistic expressions are associated with\nintensions, functions from possible worlds to appropriate extensions.\nIn the case of expressions designating individuals, these intensions\nwill be functions from possible worlds to individuals. Note that all\nrigid designators (whether directly referential or not) will have\nintensions that are constant functions: they will be functions that\nmap all possible worlds to the same individual. Thus possible worlds\nsemantics tends to blur the distinction between directly referential\nexpressions and rigid non-directly referential expressions (e.g. rigid\ndefinite descriptions). To make the distinction between directly\nreferential expressions and rigid non-directly referential expressions\nmore vivid, Kaplan invoked the notion of structured propositions:\n\n\nIf I may wax metaphysical in order to fix an image, let us think of\nthe vehicles of evaluation\u2014the what-is-said in a given\ncontext\u2014as propositions. Don\u2019t think of propositions as\nsets of possible worlds, but rather as structured entities looking\nsomething like the sentences which express them. For each occurrence\nof a singular term in a sentence there will be a corresponding\nconstituent in the proposition expressed. The constituent of the\nproposition determines, for each circumstance of evaluation, the\nobject relevant to evaluating the proposition in that circumstance. In\ngeneral the constituent of the proposition will be some sort of\ncomplex, constructed from various attributes by logical composition.\nBut in the case of a singular term which is directly referential, the\nconstituent of the proposition is just the object itself. Thus it is\nthat it does not just turn out that the constituent determines the\nsame object in every circumstance, the constituent (corresponding to a\nrigid designator) just is the object. There is no determining to do at\nall. On this picture\u2014and this is really a picture and not a\ntheory\u2014the definite description\n\n(1) The n[(snow\nis slight & n2=9) \u2228 (~snow is slight &\n22=n+1)]\n\n\nwould yield a constituent which is complex although it would determine\nthe same object in all circumstances. Thus, (1), though a rigid\ndesignator, is not directly referential from this (metaphysical) point\nof view. (Kaplan [1977] p. 494\u2013495)\n\n\n(Kaplan goes on to attribute this \u201cmetaphysical picture\u201d\nof structured propositions to Russell.) Adopting this structured\nproposition account makes it simple to distinguish between directly\nreferential expressions and other expressions, rigid or not. Directly\nreferential expressions contribute their referents (in a context) to\nthe propositions expressed (in that context) by the sentences\ncontaining them. Non-directly referential expressions contribute some\ncomplex that may or may not determine the same individual in all\npossible circumstances. Thus the desire to distinguish clearly between\ndirectly referential expressions and other rigid designators prompted\nKaplan to re-introduce the Russellian notion of a structured\nproposition into the philosophical literature (see the discussion of\nRussell below). However, Kaplan [1977] tends to treat the notion of a\nstructured proposition as a heuristic device. He repeatedly calls it a\npicture, explicitly says that it is not part of his theory, and in his\nformal semantics he adopts the possible worlds account of propositions\n(contents of formulae), taking them to be functions from worlds (and\ntimes) to truth values.\n\nMany current direct reference theorists take the structured\nproposition account much more seriously. It is part of their theory in\nthe sense that when they say that an expression is directly\nreferential they are literally saying that it contributes its referent\nto propositions expressed by sentences containing it, (e.g. see the\ndiscussion of Salmon and Soames below).\n",
