    "main_text": "The Morality of Procreation || The Non-Identity Problem and Impersonal Considerations\n3.1 The Non-Identity Problem and Impersonal Considerations\n\nIt might be hoped that we could give a full account of permissible\nprocreation by appealing only to the interests of the individuals\naffected by procreative decisions. Unfortunately, there is reason to\nthink that this may not be possible. Consider the following sort of\ncase, introduced into the literature by Parfit (1984), and known as\nthe non-identity problem (Hanser 1990; Harman 2004; Woodward 1986;\nentry on\n the nonidentity problem):\n\n\nMarie is taking a drug that she knows will cause a birth\ndefect\u2014say, a withered arm\u2014in any child that she conceives\n(call this child \u201cAmy\u201d). In 3 months this drug will have\npassed from her body, and she will be able to conceive a child free\nfrom this defect (call this child \u201cSophie\u201d). Intuitively,\nMarie does something wrong in deciding to have Amy rather than\nSophie.\n\n\nNon-identity cases of this kind are called \u201csame-number\u201d\ncases because they involve comparing situations that contain the same\nnumber of individuals. Other versions of the non-identity problem\ninvolve different-number (or non-comparative) choices:\n\n\nSri has a genetic condition that she knows will cause any child she\nconceives to be born with a serious cognitive disability. Despite\nknowing this fact, Sri deliberately conceives and gives birth to a\nseriously cognitively disabled child, Aarav.\n\n\nAssume, plausibly, that Amy and Aarav have lives that are worth\nliving. Does Marie do something wrong in conceiving and giving birth\nto Amy? Does Sri do something wrong conceiving and giving birth to\nAarav? Many are inclined to think that they do, but it is unclear how\nwe can capture this wrongness by appeal only to the interests of the\nindividuals involved. This is because wronging someone seems to\npresuppose that things could have gone otherwise for that individual,\nbut things could not have gone otherwise for either Amy or Aarav.\nSri\u2019s putative wrong consists in creating Aarav, and doing\notherwise would have entailed creating no one. Her action has no\nvictim and therefore sets back no one\u2019s interests. Amy\nisn\u2019t made worse off by Marie\u2019s actions, for had Marie\nwaited another three months before conceiving she would have given\nbirth to a different child (Sophie) instead of Amy. It is therefore\ndifficult to see how Marie might have harmed or wronged Amy.\n\nIt is also prima facie implausible that the interests of other parties\nexplain why these actions would be wrong: they are wanted and their\nbirths don\u2019t harm their community.\n\nThe non-identity problem is not solely a problem for the morality of\nprocreation. Anyone who affects the welfare of future people in\nidentity-affecting ways may face it. Readers interested in general\napproaches to the non-identity problem should consult the relevant\nentry. Here we discuss just those aspects bearing on the ethics of\nbecoming parents (see also Hanser 1990; Vehmas 2002).\n\nFeinberg (1992) compares situations like the Marie and Sri cases with\ncases in which someone is harmed in the course of being saved from a\ngreater harm (e.g., his leg is broken while his life is being saved).\nIn both cases an evil or harm is justified in virtue of the fact that\nit is a necessary condition of a greater good\u2014in the one case\nsaving a person\u2019s life, in the other case bringing a life into\nexistence. Shiffrin (1999), however, holds that harming someone to\nsave them from a greater harm is morally distinct from harming them to\nimpose a \u201cpure benefit\u201d on them. Shiffrin claims that we\nhave serious qualms about harming someone without their consent to\nsecure a pure benefit for them, even when we can be sure that they\nwould regard the pure benefit as far outweighing the harm (see also\nSteinbock and McClamrock 1994). She concludes that procreation is\nroutinely more morally problematic than is generally recognized.\n\nShiffrin\u2019s attempt to drive a wedge into Feinberg\u2019s\nanalogy raises questions of its own. First, one might challenge the\nassumption that life is a pure benefit. Even if we assume that\nAmy\u2019s life would be worth living, creating her would be a\nbenefit only on a rather peculiar conception of what a\n\u201cbenefit\u201d entails. Amy is not better off than she\notherwise would have been, for there is no way that she otherwise\nwould have been. Furthermore, the argument may prove too much. If one\nis never justified in harming someone (without their consent) to\nimpose a pure benefit on them, and if existence always involves some\nform of harm, then it must always be wrong to bring someone into\nexistence. A global form of anti-natalism (see\n Section 2.4)\n thereby seems to be the price of this solution to the non-identity\nproblem.\n\nA number of authors, including Parfit, argue that we need to appeal to\nimpersonal considerations to solve the non-identity problem. Several\nof these solutions appeal to the role morality of parents. According\nto Freeman, \u201cThe principle of parental responsibility requires\nthat individuals should desist from having children unless certain\nminimum conditions can be satisfied. Responsible parents want their\nchildren to have good and fulfilling lives\u201d (1997, 180). Freeman\ngoes on to claim that the principle of parental responsibility entails\nthat the very young and very old should not become parents. Similarly,\nPurdy claims that one shouldn\u2019t reproduce unless one can ensure\nthat one\u2019s children will have a decent life, with clean water,\nnutritious food, shelter, education, and medical care counting as\nbasic prerequisites (Purdy 1995). Purdy\u2019s position seems to\nimply that many\u2014even most\u2014of the world\u2019s children\nhave been wrongly brought into existence. More recently, Wasserman has\nargued that whether it is permissible to bring a child into existence\nwith certain characteristics (such as impairments), depends on the\nreasons the prospective parents have for creating such a child. These\nshould be reasons that concern the good of the child, which can still\nsupport creating a child whose life will predictably go worse than\nthat of another child who could be created instead (Wasserman 2005).\nOthers have taken similar reasoning to show that prospective parents\ncan be morally criticized for their attitudes to future children, such\nthat the desire to have a child with a harmful condition is wrongful\n(Kahane 2009).\n\nNot all of those who have written on the non-identity problem accept\nthat Marie does wrong in deciding to have Amy rather than Sophie, or\nthat Sri does wrong in reproducing. Indeed, some find the suggestion\nthat it is wrong to (knowingly) bring disabled children into the world\nabhorrent due to the implications of such views for individuals with\ndisabilities. Asch holds that a woman has a right to an abortion, but\nalso that it would be wrong to have an abortion to prevent the birth\nof a disabled child. Abortion on such grounds is immoral, she argues,\nbecause it communicates that \u201cdisability is so terrible it\nwarrants not being alive\u201d (Asch 1999, 387). The argument could\neasily be extended to decisions about whether to conceive a certain\ntype of child. Does prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion, or\npreimplantation genetic diagnosis, communicate that disability is so\nterrible it warrants not being alive? On its face this claim is\ncontestable; the associated decisions are highly specific to each\ncase. And even if such acts did communicate something, it is unclear\nthat it would be a thesis about relative qualities of life (see also\nBuchanan et al. 2000, chap. 7). For more discussion of the ethics of\ncreating people with disabilities see encyclopedia article on\n disability: health, well-being, and personal relationships.\n",
