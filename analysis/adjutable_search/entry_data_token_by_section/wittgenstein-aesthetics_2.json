    "main_text": "The Critique of Traditional Aesthetics || Predicates and Rules\n1.2 Predicates and Rules\n\n\nBut the adjectival form of many\u2014not all\u2014critical\npredicates quickly reinforces the \u201cproperty-with-name\u201d\nmodel, and against this Wittgenstein places examples from musical and\npoetical criticism, where we simply call attention to the rightness of\na transition or to the precision or aptness of an image. And it is\nhere that Wittgenstein reminds us that descriptions such as\n\u201cstately\u201d, \u201cpompous\u201d, or\n\u201cmelancholy\u201d (where the latter is said of a Schubert\npiece) are like giving the work a face (Shiner 1978), or we could\ninstead (or in further specification of such descriptions) use\n gestures.[2]\n In cases of re-construing a work (e.g. the meter of a poem) so that\nwe understand its rhythm and structure anew, we make gestures, facial\nexpressions, and non-descriptive-predicate based remarks, where\naesthetic adjectives play a diminished role or no role at all. And we\nshow our approval of a tailor's work not by describing the suit, but\nby wearing it. Occasions and activities are fundamental, descriptive\nlanguage secondary.\n\n\nWittgenstein here turns to the subject of rules, and rule-following,\nin aesthetic decision-making. This stems from his reflection on the\nword \u201ccorrect\u201d in aesthetic discourse, and he mentions the\ncase of being drilled in harmony and counterpoint. Such rule-learning,\nhe claims, allows what he calls an interpretation of the rules in\nparticular cases, where an increasingly refined judgment comes from an\nincreasingly refined mastery of the rules in question. It is of\nparticular interest that a qualification is entered here, that such\nrules in contexts of artistic creativity and aesthetic judgment,\n\u201cmay be extremely explicit and taught, or not formulated at\nall\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966).  This itself strongly suggests that,\nin this way too, actions come first, where these actions may\n(to invoke Kant's famous distinction) either explicitly follow from\nthe rule, or stand in accordance with them but (for Wittgenstein) in\nan inexplicit way. The mastery of a practice can be, but need not be,\ncharacterized as a cognitive matter of rule-following. Here we thus\nfind one of the points of intersection between Wittgenstein's\nwork in aesthetics and his work in the philosophy of language: the\nrule-following considerations (Holtzman and Leich 1981 and McDowell\n1998) and the debate concerning non-cognitivism (McDowell 2000) link\ndirectly to this discussion.\n\n\nRegrettably, Wittgenstein closes this matter prematurely (claiming\nthat this issue should not come in at this point); the linkage between\nrule-following in language and in aesthetics is still to this day too\nlittle investigated. Yet there is a sense in which Wittgenstein\nextends the discussion, if only implicitly. In investigating the kinds\nof things meant by aesthetic \u201cappreciation\u201d, he does say\nthat \u201can appreciator is not shown by the interjections he\nuses\u201d but rather by his choices, selections, his actions on\nspecific occasions. To describe what appreciation consists in, he\nclaims, would prove an impossibility, for \u201cto describe what it\nconsists in we would have to describe the whole environment\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 7), and he returns to the case of the\ntailor\u2014and thus implicitly to rule-following. Such rules, as we\ndiscern them in action ranging on a continuum from the\ncognitively-explicit and linguistically encapsulated to the\nnon-cognitively implicit and only behaviorally manifested, have a life\n\u2013 have an identity as rules\u2014within, and only\nwithin, those larger contexts of engagement, those \u201cwhole\nenvironment[s]\u201d. And those environments, those contexts, those\nlanguage-games, are not reducible to a unitary kind which we then\nmight analyze for essential properties: \u201ccorrectness\u201d, for\nexample, plays a central role in some cases of aesthetic appreciation\nand understanding, and it is irrelevant in others, e.g. in\ngarment-cutting versus Beethoven symphonies, or in domestic\narchitecture versus the Gothic cathedral. And he explicitly draws, if\ntoo briefly, the analogy that emerges here between ethics and\naesthetics: he notes the difference between saying of a person that he\nbehaves well versus saying that a person made a great or profound\nimpression. Indeed, \u201cthe entire\ngame is different\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 8).\n",
