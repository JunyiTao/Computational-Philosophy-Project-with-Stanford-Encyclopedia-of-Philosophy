    "main_text": "Four Basic Questions || The Replicator Question\n2.2 The Replicator Question\n\nThe focus of discussions about replicators concerns just which organic\nentities actually meet the definition of replicator. Answering this\nquestion obviously turns on what one takes the definition of\nreplicator to be. In this connection the revision of the original\nmeaning of \u201creplicator\u201d turned out to be central. The\nrevised meaning refined and restricted the meaning of\n\u201creplicator,\u201d which was defined as \u201can entity that\npasses on its structure directly in replication\u201d (Hull 1980:\n318). The terms replicator and interactor will be\nused in this latter sense in the rest of this entry.\n\nThe revised definition of replicator corresponds more closely than the\noriginal one to a long-standing debate in genetics about how large or\nsmall a fragment of a genome ought to count as a replicating\nunit\u2014something that is copied, and which can be treated\nseparately in evolutionary theory (see especially Lewontin 1970; Hull\n1980). This debate revolves critically around the issue of linkage\ndisequilibrium and led some biologists to advocate the usage of\nparameters referring to the entire genome rather than to allele and\ngenotypic frequencies in genetical models (Lewontin\n 1974).[5]\n The basic point is that with much linkage disequilibrium, individual\ngenes cannot be considered as replicators because they do not behave\nas separate units during reproduction. Although this debate remains\npertinent to the choice of state space of genetical model, it has been\neclipsed by concerns about interactors in evolutionary genetics.\n\nThis is not to suggest that the replicator question has been solved.\nWork on the replicator question is part of a rich and continuing\nresearch program; it is simply no longer a large part of the units\ndebates. That this parting of ways took place is largely due to the\nfact that evolutionists working on the units problems tacitly adopted\nthe original suggestion that the replicator, whatever it turned out to\nbe, be called the \u201cgene\u201d (Dawkins 1982b, pp. 84-86; see\n section 3.3).\n This move neatly removes the replicator question from consideration.\nExactly why this move should have met with near universal acceptance\nis to some extent historical, however the fact that the intellectual\ntools (largely mathematical models) of the participants in the units\ndebates were better suited to dealing with aspects of that debate\nother than the replicator question which requires mainly bio-chemical\ninvestigation, surely contributed to this outcome.\n\nThere is a very important class of exceptions to this general\nabandonment of the replicator question. Developmental Systems Theory\nwas formulated as a radical alternative to the interactor/replicator\ndichotomy (Oyama 1985; Griffiths & Gray 1994, 1997; Oyama,\nGriffiths, & Gray 2001). Here the evolving unit is understood to\nbe the developing system as a whole, privileging neither the\nreplicator nor the interactor.\n\nThere has also been a profound reconception of the evolution by\nselection process, which has rejected the role of replicator as\nmisconceived. In its place the role of \u201creproducer\u201d is\nproposed, which focuses on the material transference of genetic and\nother matter from generation to generation (Griesemer 2000a,b; see\nForsdyke 2010; see\n section 3.5).\n On this approach, thinking in terms of reproducers incorporates\ndevelopment into heredity and the evolutionary process. It also allows\nfor both epigenetic and genetic inheritance to be dealt with within\nthe same framework. The reproducer plays a central role, along with a\nhierarchy of interactors, in work on the units of evolutionary\ntransition (see\n Evolutionary Transition;\n Griesemer 2000c). This topic concerns the major transitions of life\nfrom one level of complexity to the next, for example, the transition\nfrom unicellularity to multicellularity. More recently, another notion\nwas introduced of a \u201creproducer\u201d that is more broadly\ninclusive, in that it relaxes the material overlap requirement and\nfocuses on an understanding of \u201cwho came from whom, and roughly\nwhere one begins and another ends\u201d (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 86).\n\nThese two definitions of \u201creproducer\u201d disagree about\nretroviral reproduction, and what counts as a salient material bond\nbetween generations. On one side is the claim that there is no\nmaterial overlap in the case of retroviral reproduction, and that the\nkey is formal or informational relations (Godfrey-Smith 2009). On the\nother side, is a view that sees material overlap due to RNA strand\nhybridization guiding and channeling flows of information (Griesemer\n2014, 2016). There is also the introduction of a notion of reproducer\nthat involves only the copying of a property, with no substance\noverlapping involved (Nanay 2011). Like the second view of reproducer,\nit appeals to the case of retroviruses having no material overlap (cf.\nGriesemer 2014, 2016).\n",
