    "main_text": "The Argument From Not (Easily) Knowable Propositions || The Argument from Lottery Propositions\n4.2 The Argument from Lottery Propositions\n\nIt seems apparent that I do not know not-win, I will not win\nthe state lottery tonight, even though my odds for hitting it big are\nvanishingly small. But suppose my heart\u2019s desire is to own a 10\nmillion dollar villa in the French Riviera. It seems plausible to say\nthat I know not-buy, I will not buy that villa tomorrow,\nsince I lack the means, and that I know the conditional, if\nwin then buy, i.e., tomorrow I will buy the villa if\nI win the state lottery tonight. From the conditional and\nnot-buy it follows that not-win, so, given closure,\nknowing the conditional and not-buy positions me to know\nnot-win. As this reasoning shows, the unknowability of claims\nlike not-win together with the knowability of claims like\nnot-buy position us to launch another challenge to\nclosure.\n\nLet a lottery proposition be a proposition, like\nnot-win, that (at least normally) is supportable only on the\ngrounds that its probability is very high but less than 1. Vogel\n(1990, 2004) and Hawthorne (2004, 2005) have noted that a great number\nof propositions that do not actually involve lotteries resemble\nlottery propositions in that they can be given a probability that is\nclose to but less than 1. Such propositions might be described as\nlotteryesque. The events mentioned in a claim can be subsumed\nunder indefinitely many reference classes, and there is no\nauthoritative way to choose which among these determines the\nprobability of the subsumed events. By carefully selecting among these\nclasses we can often find ways to suggest that the probability of a\nclaim is less than 1. Take, for example, not-stolen, the\nproposition that the car you just parked in front of the house has not\nbeen stolen: by selecting the class, red cars stolen from in front\nof your house in the last hour, we can portray the statistical\nprobability of not-stolen as 1. But by selecting, cars\nstolen in the U.S., we can portray the probability as\nsignificantly less than 1. If, like lottery propositions, lotteryesque\npropositions are not easily known, they increase the pressure on the\nclosure principle, since they are entailed by a wide range of mundane\npropositions which become unknowable, given closure.\n\nHow great a threat to K (and GK) are lottery and\nlotteryesque propositions? The matter is somewhat controversial.\nHowever, there is a great deal to be said for treating lottery\npropositions one way and lotteryesque propositions another.\n\nAs for lottery propositions: several theorists suggest that we do not\nin fact know that they are true because knowing them requires\nbelieving them because of something that establishes their\ntruth, and we (normally) cannot establish the truth of lottery\npropositions. There are various ways to understand what is meant by\n\u201cestablishing\u201d the truth of a claim. Dretske, as we have\nseen, thinks that knowledge entails having a conclusive reason for\nthinking as we do. David Armstrong (1973, p. 187) said that knowledge\nentails having a belief state that \u201censures\u201d truth. Safe\nindication theorists suggest that we know things when we believe them\nbecause of something that safely indicates their truth. And Harman and\nSherman (2004, p. 492) say that knowledge requires believing as we do\nbecause of something \u201cthat settles the truth of that\nbelief.\u201d On all four views, we fail to know that a claim is true\nwhen our only grounds for believing it is that it is highly likely.\nHowever, the unknowability of lottery propositions is not a\nsubstantial threat to closure, since it is not obvious that there are\npropositions that are both known to be true and that entail lottery\npropositions. Consider the example discussed earlier: the conditional\nif win then buy together with not-buy. If I\nknow these, then, by GK, I know not-win, a lottery\nproposition. But it is quite plausible to deny that I do know these.\nAfter all, I might win the lottery.\n\nNow consider lotteryesque propositions. We cannot defend closure by\ndenying that we know any mundane proposition that entails a\nlotteryesque proposition since it is clear that we know that many\nthings are true that entail lotteryesque propositions. To defend\nclosure we must instead say that lotteryesque propositions are\nknowable. They differ from genuine lottery propositions in that they\nmay be supportable on grounds that establish their truth. If I base my\nbelief not-stolen solely on crime statistics, I will fail to\nknow that it is true. But I can instead base it on observations, such\nas having just parked it in my garage, and so forth, that, under the\ncircumstances, establish that not-stolen holds.\n",
