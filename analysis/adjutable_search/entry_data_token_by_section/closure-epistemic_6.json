    "main_text": "The Argument From Nonclosure of Knowledge Modes || Responses to Dretske\n3.2 Responses to Dretske\n\nThere have been various rejoinders to Dretske\u2019s argument from\nnonclosure of knowledge modes.\n\nFirst, failure of one or more of the modes closure principles does not\nimply that K fails. What matters is whether the various modes\nof knowledge Dretske discusses position us to know the consequences of\nthe things we know. In other words, the issue is whether the following\nprinciple is true:\n\n(T)\nIf, while knowing p via perception, testimony, proof,\nmemory, or something that indicates or carries the information\nthat p, S believes q because p\nentails q, then S knows q.\n\n\nSecond, theorists have defended some of these modes closure\nprinciples, such as PC, IC and NC. Dretske\nrejects these three principles because he thinks perception,\nindication and information are best analyzed in terms of conclusive\nreasons, which undermines closure. But the three principles (or\nsomething very much like them) may be defended if we analyze\nperception, indication and information in terms of safe indication.\nConsider IC and NC. Both are true if we analyze\nindication and information as follows:\n\nR indicates p iff p would be true if\nR held.\n\nR carries the information that p iff p\nwould be true if R held.\n\nA version of PC may be defended if we make use of Dretske\u2019s own\nnotion of indirect perception (1969). Consider a scientist who studies\nthe behavior of electrons by watching bubbles they leave behind in a\ncloud chamber. The electrons themselves are invisible, but the\nscientist can perceive that the (invisible) electrons are\nmoving in certain ways by perceiving that the (visible)\nbubbles left behind are arranging themselves in specific ways. What we\ndirectly perceive positions us to perceive various things indirectly.\nNow assume that when we directly or indirectly perceive p,\nand this causes us to believe q, where p entails\nq, we are positioned to perceive q indirectly. Then\nwe are well on our way to accepting some version of PC, such\nas, for example:\n\n(SPC)\nIf S perceives p, and this causes\nS to believe q, then S perceives\nq.\n\n",
