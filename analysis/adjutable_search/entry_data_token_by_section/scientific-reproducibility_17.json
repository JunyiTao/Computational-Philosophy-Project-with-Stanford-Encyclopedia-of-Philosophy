    "main_text": "Open Science Reforms: Values, Tone, and Scientific Norms || Peer Review\n4.3 Peer Review\n\nRegistered reports. Registered reports shift the point at\nwhich peer review occurs in the research process, in an effort to\ncombat publication bias against null (negative) results. Manuscripts\nare submitted, reviewed and a publication decision made on the basis\nof the introduction, methods and planned analysis alone. If accepted,\nauthors then have a defined period of time to carry out the planned\nresearch and submit the results. Assuming authors followed their\noriginal plans (or adequately justified deviations from them), the\njournal will honour its decision to publish, regardless of the result\noutcomes. In psychology, the Registered Report format has been\nchampioned by Chris Chambers, with the journal Cortex being\nthe first to adopt the format under Chambers\u2019 editorship\n(Chambers 2013, 2017; Nosek & Lakens 2014). Currently (end of May\n2018), 108 journals in a range of biomedical, psychology and\nneuroscience fields, offer the format (see Registered Reports in\n Other Internet Resources).\nPre-prints. Well-established in some sciences like\nphysics, the use of pre-print servers is relatively new in biological\nand social sciences.\n\n",
