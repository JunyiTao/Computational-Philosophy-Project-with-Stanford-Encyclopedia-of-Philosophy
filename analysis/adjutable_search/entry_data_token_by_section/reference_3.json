    "main_text": "Proper Names || Millian Heirs\n2.2 Millian Heirs\n\nThe primary alternative to the descriptivist theory of names has\ntypically gone by the name of \u2018Millianism\u2019. According to\nthis view, which dates back to John Stuart Mill (1867), a name\u2019s\nmeaning is simply its referent. In its modern form, the view was\nintroduced by Ruth Barcan Marcus (1961), who proposed that we ought to\nconceive of proper names as \u2018tags\u2019. To say that proper\nnames are tags is, for Marcus, to say that they have no linguistic\nmeaning beyond their reference. Proper\nnames do not, on this sort of view, refer by way of the descriptions\nthey allegedly stand for. Rather, they refer directly, as it\nis sometimes put, to their bearers. Important consequences of this\ntheory include, as Marcus notes, the necessity of identity statements\nbetween co-referring proper names\u2014something which, though\nhighly intuitive, is not guaranteed by many descriptivist theories of\nproper\n names.[4]\n Other important consequences include the dissolution of puzzles\ninvolving substitutivity in modal contexts (Marcus 1993).\n\nOf course, saying that names function as tags\u2014or that they are\n\u2018directly referential\u2019\u2014is not to provide a full\ntheory of names. That will require, at the very least, an explanation\nof what makes a name the particular tag that it is. In other words, we\nneed to specify what it is, if not an associated description,\nthat fixes what a name refers to in context. Put slightly differently,\nthe claim that names function as tags effectively furnishes us with a\nsemantics for names. What remains, is to provide a\nmetasemantics for names, a theory that tells us which\nsemantic value should be associated with each name, and why.\n\nThe most popular option has been to pair a Millian semantics with a\nmetasemantic picture adumbrated at roughly the same time by Peter\nGeach (1969), Keith Donnellan (1970), and the aforementioned Kripke\n(1972). Typically called the \u2018causal theory of reference\u2019,\nthe central idea developed in these works is that (the use of) a name\nrefers to whatever is linked to it in the appropriate way\u2014a\nway that does not require speakers to associate any identifying\ndescriptive content whatsoever with the name. The causal theory is\ngenerally presented as having two components: one dealing with\nreference fixing, the other dealing with reference borrowing.\nReference, on this sort of view, is initially fixed via a dubbing. In\nother words, a language user gives a name to an object, by\nsaying something like \u201cYou\u2019re to be called\n\u2018N\u2019.\u201d The standard case is supposed to be\none where the dubber is occurrently perceiving the target object when\nshe utters this. Then, after this initial act of reference-fixing, the\nname is passed on from speaker to speaker through communicative\nexchanges. Speakers succeed in referring to something by means of its\nname, on this sort of view, because underlying their uses of the name\nare links in a causal chain stretching back to the initial dubbing of\nthe object with that name. Subsequent speakers thus effectively\n\u2018borrow\u2019 their reference from speakers earlier in the\nchain, though borrowers needn\u2019t be able to identify any of the lenders\nthey are in fact relying on. All that is required is that borrowers\nare appropriately linked to their lenders through chains of\ncommunication, chains of passing on the name.\n\nAs Kripke points out, complications arise due to the fact that we can\napparently re-use names. So, I may have come across the name\n\u2018Napoleon\u2019 via a chain of use leading back to the most\nfamous of French generals. Having heard the name, I may now decide to\ncall my cat, who likes to imperiously survey the domain of my\napartment, \u2018Napoleon\u2019. When I use the name in this way, my\nintentions make it the case, Kripke claims, that I have introduced a\nnew name, or at least a new use of the name. This is in spite of the\nfact that there is a very real sense in which I inherited the name\nfrom a historical tradition that traces back to 18th century France.\nThe take-home is this: not every sort of causal connection to previous\nuse is equal, according to the causal theorist. Some will help to fix\nreference, whereas others are irrelevant. And while it would certainly\nbe nice to have a complete theory of which of these is which, a\ndetailed account of all this has proven remarkably difficult to\n offer.[5]\n\n",
