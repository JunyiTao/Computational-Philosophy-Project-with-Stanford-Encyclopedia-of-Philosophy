    "main_text": "International Rule of Law || Thin Theories of the International Rule of Law\n5.2 Thin Theories of the International Rule of Law\n\nInternational law may fare better on \u201cthin\u201d accounts of\nthe rule of law, as these are limited to a familiar set of\nformal-procedural desiderata that are not intended to be exhaustive of\nthe desiderata applicable to the assessment of law (Franck 1995;\nChesterman 2008). These desiderata include the following: that legal\nnorms be expressed in general, prospective, and clear terms, that they\nare relatively stable over time and do not issue in conflicting\ndemands or demands that cannot be feasibly complied with, that\nofficials (judges, bureaucrats, police etc) charged with applying them\ndo so consistently and in accordance with their meaning, and so on\n(Raz 1979: 214\u20138; Fuller, 1964: 33\u201341). These\nformal-procedural requirements are usually thought to require certain\ninstitutional arrangements for their effective realization, such as an\nindependent judiciary and access to professional legal advice.\n\nWhile proponents of the thin theory admit that compliance with the\nrule of law, so understood, is compatible with extreme injustice, it\nnonetheless has inherent value, an important way of respecting those\nsubject to laws as rational agents who are given the opportunity to\ntake legal norms into account in their practical deliberation prior to\nreaching a decision (Fuller 1964: 162; Raz 1979: 221; Finnis 2011:\n273). In this way, it acts as a significant, but not comprehensive,\nlimitation on certain forms of arbitrary official power. Moreover,\nsome requirements of the rule of law, such as the prohibition of\nretrospective punishment, seem to capture basic demands of justice.\nFinally, the rule of law has various kinds of instrumental value, such\nas helping achieve social goods including economic efficiency (by\nfostering a predictable environment for economic decision-making) and\ndemocratic governance (by ensuring, for example, that laws enacted\ndemocratically are effectively applied according to their terms).\n\nBut even on a thin interpretation of the rule of law, there are\nproblems about its applicability to international law. Jeremy Waldron\nhas highlighted two major disanalogies between domestic and\ninternational law that bear on the applicability of the rule of law\nideal in the case of the latter (Waldron 2011). The first is that,\nunlike ordinary citizens in domestic legal systems who are contrasted\nwith officials, states in the international legal order are both the\nsubjects of international law and its officials (its creators, e.g.,\nvia treaty-making and processes of customary international law, and\nits enforcers, e.g., via countermeasures). The second disanalogy is\nthat, unlike individual human beings, states do not have inherent\nmoral value; in particular, their freedom seems to be valuable only\ninsofar as it serves the interests of individual human beings. One\npractical upshot of both of these disanalogies is that we cannot\nreadily proceed on the assumption, which is justified in the domestic\ncase in relation to the conduct of individuals, that state conduct\nshould be free of official interference unless clearly circumscribed\nby law. One response to Waldron\u2019s first disanalogy is to say\nthat it is a matter of degree; even in a domestic legal order,\ncompliance with the rule of law will depend upon the attitudes and\nhabits of ordinary citizens in sustaining a rule of law respecting\nculture. Meanwhile, one response to the second disanalogy is to argue\nthat although state autonomy is not inherently valuable, it acquires\nvalue derivatively, as a means of protecting the autonomy of\nindividuals and groups within states (Pavel 2021: 346).\n\nFinally, some argue that the enormous power disparities among states,\ncombined with the absence of centralized and effective enforcement\nmechanisms, pose a systemic obstacle to the realization of the rule of\nlaw (Posner 2009). It is an open question to what extent the\nproliferation of discrete international legal regimes, e.g., relating\nto trade, human rights, with associated adjudicatory mechanisms, e.g.,\nWorld Trade Organization, regional human rights courts such as the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights or the Inter-American Court of Human\nRights, begin to address this problem.\n\nEven if we admit that the rule of law applies to international law,\nthere is a further question regarding the extent to which\ninternational law, in its current manifestation, complies with it\n(Lefkowitz 2020: 90\u201397). This is an immense topic, so it can\nonly be dealt with very cursorily here by reference to three problem\nareas pertaining to sources of law (custom), United Nations\ninstitutions (the UN Security Council), and one domain of law in which\nrule of law considerations have occasioned much controversy\n(international criminal law).\n",
