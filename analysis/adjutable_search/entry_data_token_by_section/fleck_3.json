    "main_text": "Collective Moods\n4. Collective Moods\n\nMembers of a thought collective naturally possess a certain bond, some\nfeeling of group solidarity, of being a \u201ccomrade\u201d,\n\u201ccoreligionist\u201d, \u201ccountryman\u201d, or\n\u201ccolleague\u201d. It is accompanied by the feeling of hostility\nor contempt to a \u201cstranger\u201d, who worships other gods, is\nguided by other values, or uses unfamiliar words etc.\n\nThe force which maintains the collective and unites its members is\nderived from the community of the collective mood. This mood\nproduces the readiness for an identically directed perception,\nevaluation and use of what is perceived, i.e. a common thought-style\n(1936, V).\n\n\nThese are collective moods which induce members of collectives both to\nsacrifice themselves for others and to burn dissenters at stakes. They\nmake scientists work for public enlightenment, and at the same time\nthey arouse the feeling of disdain for astrologists or alchemists.\n\nFleck stresses that there is no thinking which is free from emotions:\n\u201cThere is only agreement or difference between feelings, and the\nuniform agreement in the emotions of a society is, in its content,\ncalled freedom from emotions\u201d (1935a, II.4). Emotions have a\nsocial character; they are already hidden in a language employed by a\ncollective. Technical terms not only denote something determined by\ntheir definitions, but they also encompass \u201ca certain specific\npower, being not only a name but also a slogan\u201d, they have\n\u201ca specific thought-charm\u201d. This is why once the members\nof an esoteric circle master technical terminology there appears a\nsense of mission, and joining such a circle itself has \u201cthe\nvalue of the sacrament of initiation\u201d (1936, V).\n\nIf the position of an elite is stronger than the position of the\nmasses, the elite isolates itself and demands obedience from the\nmasses. Such collectives develop dogmatic styles of thinking in which\na test of correctness is usually located in some distant past in a\nmore or less mythical master or savior. Collective life acquires a\nceremonial character and access to the esoteric circle is\nwell-guarded. Conservatism reigns: there is no place for fundamentally\nnew ideas, and one can only better or worse realize the revealed\nprinciples. This is characteristic of most religious collectives.\n\nIf the position of the masses is stronger than that of an\nelite\u2014like in scientific collectives\u2014the elite endeavors\nafter trust and appreciation of the masses, pledging its commitment to\nserve common good. This collective has a democratic character: the\ntest of correctness is \u201cthe recognition by everybody\u201d.\nEverybody is encouraged to learn, and everybody who meets intellectual\nstandards can become a member of the esoteric circle. \u201cThis\nobligation is also expressed in the democratically equal regard for\nanybody that acquires knowledge. All research workers, as a matter of\nprinciple, are regarded as possessing equal rights\u201d (1935a,\nIV.5). In principle every man\u2014not only an elite with special\nprivileges\u2014should be able to verify whether a statement is true,\nto repeat an experiment conducted by somebody else etc.\n\nHere an unsolvable problem arises. General education, necessary for\njoining a scientific collective, is acquired in schools before\nmaturing, and if this is not achieved an individual is practically\ndoomed to remain outside the scientific collective. In science no\ntransfers from the uneducated general public to the body of general\nspecialists occur. However, a democratic respect for an (imagined)\n\u201canybody\u201d grants scientific thought styles an impersonal\ncharacter which in turn leads to the objectivization of collectively\ncreated thought structures. Objective truth expressed clearly and\nprecisely becomes an ideal. Of course, this ideal is to be realized in\nsome distant (maybe even infinite) future. However, even if a\nresearcher herself is removed from the results of her work, a cult of\nscientific heroes and geniuses devoted to scientific service\ndevelops.\n\nPart of a collective mood arises at the point of contact between\nesoteric and exoteric circles. On the one hand, members of exoteric\ncircles usually trust professionals and they admire them. On the other\nhand esoteric circles act under pressure of expectations of the\nmasses. When a certain domain lacks support from outside, it does not\nhave significant achievements. Fleck here uses an analogy of sand\ncarried by the wind. A rock sometimes hits its target and sometimes it\ndoes not, whereas sand carried by the wind unavoidably accumulates in\nhollows (1935a, III). So when some social pressure makes enough\nresearchers work long enough on a certain issue and obtain sufficient\nmaterial support, they finally arrive at more or less satisfying\nresults. A condition of success is not the alleged truth of employed\ntheories but the systematicity of research.\n",
