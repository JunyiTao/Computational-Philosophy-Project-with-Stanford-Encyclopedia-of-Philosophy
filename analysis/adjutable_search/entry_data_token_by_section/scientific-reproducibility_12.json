(See also the entry on \n  science and pseudo-science.).\nAccording to the Open Science Collaboration, \u201cReproducible\nresearch practices are at the heart of sound research and integral to\nthe scientific method.\u201d (OSC 2015: 7). Schmidt echoes this theme:\n\u201cTo confirm results or hypotheses by a repetition procedure is\nat the basis of any scientific conception\u201d (2009: 90). Braude\n(1979) goes so far as to say that reproducibility is a\n\u201cdemarcation criterion between science and nonscience\u201d\n(1979: 2). Similarly, Nosek, Spies, and Motyl state that:\n\n\n[T]he scientific method differentiates itself from other approaches by\npublicly disclosing the basis of evidence for a claim\u2026. In\nprinciple, open sharing of methodology means that the entire body of\nscientific knowledge can be reproduced by anyone. (2012: 618)\n\n\nIf replication played such an essential or distinguishing role in\nscience, we might expect it to be a prominent theme in the history of\nscience. Steinle (2016) considers the extent to which it is such a\ntheme. He presents a variety of cases from the history of science\nwhere replication played very different roles, although he understands\n\u201creplication\u201d narrowly to refer to when an experiment is\nre-run by different researchers. He claims that the role and\nvalue of replication in experimental replication is \u201cmuch more\ncomplex than easy textbook accounts make us believe\u201d (2016: 60),\nparticularly since each scientific inquiry is always tied to a variety\nof contextual considerations that can affect the importance of\nreplication. Such considerations include the relationship between\nexperimental results and the background of accepted theory at the\ntime, the practical and resource constraints on pursuing replication\nand the perceived credibility of the researchers. These contextual\nfactors, he claims, mean that replication was a key or even overriding\ndeterminant of acceptance of research claims in some cases, but not in\nothers.\n\nFor example, sometimes replication was sufficient to embrace a\nresearch claim, even if it conflicted with the background of accepted\ntheory and left theoretical questions unresolved. A case of this is\nhigh-temperature superconductivity, the effect whereby an electric\ncurrent can pass with zero resistance through a conductor at\nrelatively high temperatures. In 1986, physicists Georg Bednorz and\nAlex M\u00fcller reported finding a material which acted as a\nsuperconductor at 35 kelvin (\u2212238 degrees Celsius). Scientists\naround the world successfully replicated the effect, and Bednorz and\nMuller were then awarded with a Nobel Prize in Physics a year after\ntheir announcement. This case is remarkable since not only did their\neffect contradict the accepted physical theory at the time, but there\nis still no extant theory that adequately explains the effects which\nthey reported (Di Bucchianico, 2014).\n\nAs a contrasting example, however, sometimes claims were accepted\nwithout any replication. In the 1650s, German scientist Otto von\nGuericke designed and operated the world\u2019s first vacuum pump\nthat would visibly suck air out of a larger space. He performed\nexperiments with his device to various audiences. Yet the replication\nof his experiments by others would have been very difficult, if not\nimpossible: not only was Guericke\u2019s pump both expensive and\ncomplicated to build, but it was also unlikely that his descriptions\nof it sufficed to enable anyone to build the pump and to consequently\nreplicate his findings. Despite this, Steinle claims that \u201cno\ndoubts were raised about his results\u201d, probably as a results of\nhis \u201cpublic performances that could be witnessed by a large\nnumber of participants\u201d (2016: 55).\n\nSteinle takes such historical cases to provide normative guidance for\nunderstanding the epistemic value as replication as context-sensitive:\nwhether replication is necessary or sufficient for establishing a\nresearch claim will depend on a variety of considerations, such as\nthose mentioned earlier. He consequently eschews wide-reaching claims,\nsuch as those that \u201cit\u2019s all about replicability\u201d or\nthat \u201creplicability does not decide anything\u201d (2016:\n60).\n",
