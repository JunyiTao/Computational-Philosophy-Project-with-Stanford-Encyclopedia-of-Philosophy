    "main_text": "Later Developments and a Broader Taxonomy || Metaphysical and Epistemological Challenges\n2.1 Metaphysical and Epistemological Challenges\n\nSo far we have traced the development of structuralism in the\nphilosophy of mathematics from Benacerraf and Putnam, in the 1960s, to\nResnik, Shapiro, Hellman, Chihara, and Parsons, in the\n1980s\u201390s. During the last 20 years, a number of further\nphilosophers have started to address this topic. We now turn to the\ncorresponding discussions, starting with certain epistemological and\nmetaphysical challenges to structuralism. Some of these concern\nnon-eliminative structuralism alone, especially Shapiro\u2019s\nposition. (This again reflects the prominence of Shapiro\u2019s\nposition, to the point that it is often identified, misleadingly, with\n\u201cphilosophical structuralism\u201d.) Others are broader,\nincluding comparing the basic commitments of various forms of\nstructuralism. In what follows, we will not try to be comprehensive,\nbut provide a number of illustrative examples.\n\nNon-eliminative structuralism, in Shapiro\u2019s and other versions,\ninvolves the thesis that all that matters about mathematical objects\nare their structural properties (as opposed to further intrinsic\nproperties). In fact, such properties are taken to determine the\nobjects\u2019 identities. But then, objects that are\nindistinguishable in this respect\u2014\u201cstructural\nindiscernibles\u201d\u2014should be identified, it seems. As several\ncritics pointed out around the year 2000, this leads to the\n\u201cidentity problem\u201d for structuralism (cf. Ker\u00e4nen\n2001, earlier Burgess 1999).  It arises prominently for systems or\nstructures that are non-rigid, i.e., allow for non-trivial\nautomorphisms. In such cases, there are supposedly distinct objects\nthat are indistinguishable in the relevant sense. A widely known case\nis the system of complex numbers (with the conjugate numbers i\nand \u2212i); but geometry and graph theory, among others,\nprovide further examples. The simplest example is probably an\nunlabeled 2-element graph with no edges, whose two vertices are\nstructurally indiscernible. \n\nHow can such cases be handled from a structuralist point of view? Is\nstructuralism (of this kind) simply incoherent, as some of its critics\ncharge? Or is it at least not applicable to non-rigid cases, which\nwould limit its reach significantly? Several responses to the identity\nproblem have been offered in the literature. One suggestion is to\n\u201crigidify\u201d such structures by enlarging the vocabulary\nthat is used, e.g., by adding the constant symbol\n\u2018i\u2019 for the complex numbers (either into the\noriginal language or into the language for the \u201csetting\u201d\nused in the background, cf. Halimi 2019). But this still seems\nproblematic in the case of many indiscernibles, perhaps even\nuncountably many. Another suggestion is to treat identity as a\nprimitive notion, as is arguably part of mathematical practice. But in\nthat case too a number of questions remain (see Ladyman 2005, Button\n2006, Leitgeb & Ladyman 2008, Shapiro 2008, Ketland 2011, and\nMenzel 2018, among others).\n\nA second, more basic problem for structuralism starts again with the\nidea that all that matters about mathematical objects are their\nstructural properties. With respect to non-eliminative structuralism,\nthis is sometimes strengthened to the thesis that the positions in\nmathematical structures, as well as the abstract structures\nthemselves, \u201conly have structural properties\u201d. But if not\nformulated more carefully, this leads to counterexamples (cf. Reck\n2003). For instance, does the natural number structure not have the\nproperty that it is a favorite example in many debates about\nstructuralism?  And isn\u2019t it a property of the number 9 to have\nlong been taken to be the number of planets in the Solar System? Both\nseem clearly non-structural properties.  Once again, structuralism\nappears incoherent or, at the very least, in need of further\nclarification.\n\nA natural response to this challenge is to refine the original\nstructuralist thesis, e.g., by saying that abstract structures only\nhave structural properties \u201cessentially\u201d, that only such\nproperties are \u201cconstitutive\u201d for them, or something\nsimilar, while admitting that they have other properties too (see Reck\n2003, Schiemer & Wigglesworth forthcoming). This leads to\nquestions about how exactly to make this distinction. But even if it\nis taken to constitute a satisfactory response, another problem\nremains: How can we distinguish \u201cstructural\u201d from\n\u201cnon-structural\u201d properties in the first place? Several\nanswers to that question have been proposed in turn, e.g., that\nstructural properties are those definable in a certain way, or that\nthey are those preserved under relevant morphisms.  Yet no consensus\non that issue has been reached either (see Korbmacher & Schiemer\n2018, also for further references).\n\nA third challenge directed again especially, or even exclusively, at\nnon-eliminative structuralism concerns the following. From a\nstructuralist point of view, positions are always \u201cpositions in\na structure\u201d; i.e., the structure is primary and the positions\nare secondary. Hence, a particular mathematical object, such as the\nnatural number 2, seems \u201contologically dependent\u201d on the\nbackground structure, here the structure of the natural numbers. (The\nfact that for a structuralist it is misguided to consider the number 2\nas existing in itself reflects this aspect. It also illustrates a main\ndifference between structuralism and logicism or set-theoretic\nfoundationalism.) But how should this ontological dependence be\nunderstood? Are there perhaps connections to \u201cgrounding\u201d\nor related notions in current analytic metaphysics? In this context\ntoo, many open questions remain and a lively debate has started\n(cf. Linnebo 2008, also, e.g., MacBride 2005 and Wigglesworth\n2018). \n\nA fourth basic challenge for structuralism, mostly again in its\nnon-eliminative form, is how we can have \u201caccess\u201d to\nstructures seen as abstract objects (cf. Hale 1996, among others). To\nsome degree, this revives an older, more general debate about such\nobjects. An initial response, by Resnik, Shapiro, and Parsons (all\nfollowing Quine here), is to talk about the \u201cpositing\u201d of\nstructures, which promises to undercut the access problem.  But under\nwhat conditions is such positing legitimate (given the threat of\nparadox familiar from na\u00efve set theory)? A plausible answer\npoints to the \u201ccoherence\u201d of the relevant theories (which,\nafter G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness results, is seen as taking the\nplace of provable consistency). Yet what exactly does such coherence\namount to? An interesting outcome of the debate about this issue is\nthat Shapiro and Hellman, coming from very different directions, have\narrived at views that are very close to each other (see Hellman\n2005). Thus, in terms of some basic commitments\u2014ultimate\nconditions for existence in Shapiro\u2019s case and for possibility\nin Hellman\u2019s case\u2014their approaches converge in surprising\nways. (This may be seen as providing support for both sides, but also\nas undermining the realism/nominalism dichotomy.)\n\nThere are more challenges to structuralism in mathematics that one can\nfind in the literature of the last 20 years. While usually connected\nto the problems just surveyed, sometimes these challenges go\nfurther. For example, additional questions about the semantics\ninvolved in structuralism have been raised, typically again for the\nnon-eliminative variant (cf. Button & Walsh 2016, Assadian 2018,\netc.). Instead of summarizing these challenges too, we hope our survey\nso far provides enough illustration of the kinds of debates that have\noccurred in the recent literature already.\n",
