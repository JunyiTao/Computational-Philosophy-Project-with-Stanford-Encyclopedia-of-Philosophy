    "main_text": "\n\nThe Jains are those who consider that the teaching of the omniscient\nJinas is the expression of the eternal essential nature of the\nuniverse. The only extant teaching is that of Mah\u0101v\u012bra\n(traditional dates 599\u2013527/510 BCE, in Magadha, South of modern\nBihar), the last Jina of the current cosmic period.\n\nIn their practice, Jaina renunciants follow a rigorous method towards\nsalvation, in which a non-violent way of life, the renunciation from a\nworldly ego, the dissociation of self and non-self, and a gradual\npurification of the self towards unobstructed knowledge, become as\nmany different facets of the same effort to access to a superior order\nof being in which each self manifests its true nature.\n\nThis path came to involve structured monastic and lay communities;\nsets of practices\u2014ritual and devotional acts, ascetic practices,\nrules of life; as well as conceptions of the world deposited in\ncanonical and post-canonical corpuses, in systematic treatises, or in\nnarrative literature. Jaina Philosophy is the set of philosophical\ninvestigations developed by thinkers as they appear in these different\ncorpuses (Malvania & Soni 2007; Potter & Balcerowicz 2013,\n2014). While several trends can be observed from the canonical period\nto modern thinkers via the mystics, the following principles are\nshared: Jaina metaphysics is an atomist and dualist conception of the\nworld, it focuses on the nature of the self, on that of karmic matter,\nas well as on their principles of association. Jaina ethics consists\nof practices focused on non-violence, non-absolutism and\nnon-attachment, which aim to disentangle the self and karmic matter\nand which help one to reach omniscience. Besides, Jaina philosophers\nare particular renown for developing a realist epistemology centered\non \u201cmany-sidedness\u201d.\n\nJaina philosophy is composed in Ardham\u0101gadh\u012b, Jaina\nM\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u012b, \u015aaurasen\u012b,\nSanskrit, Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba, Braj Bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101, Kannada,\nTamil, Gujarati, Hindi, to quote only the main languages. This entry\nprovides Sanskrit terms only, because Sanskrit became the\nlingua franca of philosophical inter-doctrinal discussions in\nSouth Asia at the turn of the common era.\n",
