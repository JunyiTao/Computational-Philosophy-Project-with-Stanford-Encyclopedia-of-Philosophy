In the Western tradition it is the Greek\ntheoretician Heraclitus of Ephesus (born ca. 560 B.C.E.) who is\ncommonly recognized as the founder of the process approach. The few\nremaining fragments of Heraclitus\u2019 doctrine are often\ninterpreted as championing a philosophy of ubiquitous and radical\nflux, epitomized in the slogan panta rhei (\u201ceverything\nflows\u201d). But Heraclitus\u2019 claims are more sophisticated. To\nbe sure, the fragments contain an unambiguous commitment to ubiquitous\ndynamicity: \u201cthis world-order \u2026 is \u2026 an ever\nliving fire\u2026\u201d (Fr. 217, Kirk-Raven-Schofield). Whatever\nexists is a transformation of this cosmic fire, turning into\napparently stable forms of matter such as sea and earth (Fr. 218), but\nall the while remaining present in these apparent stabilities (Fr.\n204). Cosmic fire is the source of change of all observable\ncosmological and natural processes. Moreover, Heraclitus also\npostulates that all observable changes result from a\n\u201cstrife\u201d of opposing forces to overcome each other, thus\ncreating transformative power as the ruling condition of existence:\n\u201cwar is the father of all and king of all\u201d (Fr. 212).\nHowever, Heraclitus\u2019 reputation as the great proponent of\nradical flux (alteration at every instant) may be mainly due\nto the influence of his early commentators: Plato, Aristotle,\nMelissus, and Theophrastus. For one must not overlook that in the\nfragments we have from Heraclitus, dynamicity is tied inextricably to\nbalance or \u201cmeasure\u201d (Kirk 1951). While fire is postulated\nas an underlying pervasive cosmic factor that is creative and\nself-moving, the changes produced by fire happen in a regulated,\nmeasured way. Fire is \u201ckindling in measures and going out in\nmeasures\u201d (Fr. 217) and \u201call things are an equal exchange\nfor fire and fire for all things, as goods are for gold and gold for\ngoods\u201d (Fr. 219). Furthermore the opposing forces, which are\nmanifestations of fire, form unities of cyclical\nalternation\u2014\u201cday night, winter summer, war peace, satiety\nhunger unity\u201d(Fr. 204)\u2014that proceed within the limits of a\nquantitative measure (metron) reinforced by a\n\u201claw\u201d of nature (Fr. 226). The unity of opposites thus\ncreates an overall balance of reciprocity by cyclical transitions\nbetween extremes\u2014\u201cthese things change places and are\nthose, and those change places again and are these\u201d (Fr.202).\nThe \u201csame rivers\u201d are constituted by the regular flow\npatterns of \u201cdifferent and different waters\u201d which\n\u201cscatter and\u2026gather\u2026come together and flow\naway\u2026approach and depart\u201d (Fr. 214). Moreover, the unity\nof opposites also produces the dynamic arrest we know from \u201cthe\nbow or the lyre\u201d (Fr. 209), i.e., the motionless dynamic\npresence resulting from the tension of a \u2018backstretched\nconnection\u2019 (palintonos harmoni\u0113) pulling equally\ninto two opposite directions. In short, Heraclitus articulated three\nfundamental insights that became seminal in the history of Western\nprocess philosophy, despite the somewhat tendentious portrait of his\nthought in Greek antiquity. First, Heraclitus assigned to process or\ndynamicity the role of an explanatory feature, not only of a feature\nof nature to be explained. Second, he suggested that processes form\norganizational units and occur in a quantitatively measurable and\nordered fashion. Third, he contrasted dynamic transitions or\nalterations with dynamic permanence, and thus for the first time\nidentifies, and differentiates between, two basic\n\u2018Gestalts\u2019 or forms of dynamicity.\n\nThe direct counter-model to Heraclitus\u2019 explanation of natural\nchanges was the atomism of Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus, who\nviewed matter as constituted by inert material atoms with permanent\nproperties (e.g., weight) and took natural developments to be the\nmacroscopic effects of atoms colliding and changing their spatial\npositions. Aristotle complained that the source of motion for these\ncollisions remained unexplained and developed a philosophy of nature\nthat includes a coherent account of the source of motion in natural\noccurrences, allowing also for explanations in terms of self-realizing\nand self-maintaining structural or formal factors. In\nAristotle\u2019s view an item in nature persists by the active\nexercise of a collection of capacities, a self-maintaining internal\nprocess organization (physis, or more generally\nmorph\u0113) that realizes a characteristic sort of\nfunctioning; by means of these characteristic types of functioning we\nsort entities into natural kinds. These kind-specific capacities must\nbe realized within a matter or medium (hyl\u0113) that\nsupports the relevant process organizations but that also harbors\ncounteracting, disintegrative tendencies, due to the fact that the\nelemental components of matter (fire, water, earth, or air) actively\nstrive towards their \u201cnatural place\u201d further up or down.\nIf Aristotle indeed took these active elemental tendencies as\nfundamental and allowed for elemental transformations as changes\nper se without an underlying substratum or prime matter (as\nargued in Gill 1989), he can be counted as a process philosopher. But\nAristotle also supplied in his characterization of substance\n(ousia) those aspects that subsequent history selected to\nform the basic tenets of the paradigm of \u2018substance\nmetaphysics.\u2019 In addition, substance-metaphysics could also draw\non Aristotle\u2019s classification of changes (kineseis)\ninto generation, destruction, alteration, and locomotion, since this\nclassification rests on a sophisticated doctrine of\n\u201cpotential\u201d vs. \u201cactual\u201d features that are all\nattributed to a static subject of change. Aristotle\u2019s\ndistinction between kinesis (in this context: change,\ntransition towards a goal) and energeia (in this context:\nactivity), on the other hand, must again be counted as an important\ncontribution to process thought. Aristotle\u2019s distinction is\nformulated in relation to agentively initiated changes and activities,\nbut the logical distinction arguably extends beyond actions to\noccurrences in general. Changes such as building a\nhouse or learning lead to an end (telos) that\nlies \u201cbeyond,\u201d and are incomplete as long as the end is\nnot reached\u2014\u201csomeone who is building a house, has not\nbuilt it\u201d (Metaphysics Theta 6). In contrast,\nactivities such as seeing or living well\nare ends in themselves and complete at any moment for as long as they\nlast\u2014\u201che who is seeing has seen.\u201d Aristotle\u2019s\ndistinction between changes and activities is significant in its own\nright, but even more seminal for present-day process philosophy, since\nit is the first attempt to classify types of occurrences in terms of\nlogical and linguistic features of associated expressions (see section\n3 below).\n\nThe history of Western metaphysics since Aristotle was mainly focused\non elaborating various versions of substance metaphysics\u2014in\nfact, as one might say with Hegel, \u201cthe history of [Western]\nmetaphysics is the tendency towards substance.\u201d However,\ninterspersed in this history of substance metaphysics are pockets of\nprocess thought, partly as supplementary elements to an otherwise\nsubstance-geared theory, and partly as independent\nprocess-philosophical explorations. For example, the neo-Platonic\nphilosopher Plotinus (204\u2013270) introduced the thought that the\ndynamicity of being is the \u201cemanation of the divine.\u201d\nThomas Aquinas (1225-1274), Aristotle\u2019s most famous commentator\nin the middle ages, kept some of the processual aspects of\nAristotle\u2019s scheme more clearly in view than later scholastics.\nRenaissance philosopher Francesco Patrizi (1529\u20131597) offered\nmereological descriptions of the diffusion of processes in order to\ndevelop a \u201cmetaphysics of light.\u201d G. W. Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) devised a fully-fledged process-based metaphysics,\npostulating as basic individuals so-called \u201cmonads.\u201d\nMonads are ordered sequences of states of affairs consisting of the\nco-exemplification of properties during some period of time. But\nmonads are not static: they are endowed with an inherent \u201cactive\nforce\u201d that engenders the transitions between states. Moreover,\nsince Leibniz took temporal relations to be \u201cfounded\u201d in\nthe properties of monads, states of monads are per se not\ntemporally\n discrete.[1]\n\nA special branch of process thought opened up in late 18th and early\n19th century German Idealism, when Johann G. Fichte, Friedrich W. J.\nSchelling, and Georg W. F. Hegel responded to Immanuel Kant\u2019s\nsystem of a transcendental idealism. All three of these thinkers\nalerted to the processual nature of the \u201ctranscendental\nsubject,\u201d and aimed to overcome Kant\u2019s incongruous\npostulate of unknowable \u201cthings in themselves\u201d by focusing\non the process by which the world of knowable appearances, including\nreflective reasoning, is generated\u2014this process, or so the\nargument goes, is the most promising candidate for reality in itself.\nHegel provided the most comprehensive and detailed elaboration of this\nbasic idea. He postulated that reality is the self-unfolding of\ndynamic structures or templates (\u201cBegriffe\u201d); among these\ntemplates external contrasts arise, which trigger self-modifications\nof the templates into more differentiated versions; these in turn\ncreate further external contrasts. The result is an increasingly\ninterrelated web of dynamic dependencies, and the \u201cmovement of\nreflection\u201d that drives the interrelated differentiations of the\ntemplates in the end reaches a dynamic fixed point. According to\nHegel\u2019s dynamic structuralism, self-unfolding reality\ndifferentiates itself into mental, natural, socio-cultural, and\ninstitutional processes, and, in fact, over time develops any possible\ndifferentiation, so that in the end reality occurs as the totality of\nall possible forms of mutual conditioning. Hegel argued that this\noverall \u201cmovement\u201d of gradual self-determination by\ninternal and external differentiation drives all actual and possible\ndevelopments according to its inner necessity\u2014reality is\n\u201creason\u201d articulating itself as and within the world.\nHegel called this movement \u201cdialectics\u201d and his\nphilosophical system was an attempt to work out the\n\u2018logic\u2019 underlying the total dialectical development of\nreality. Schelling claimed that Hegelian dialectics provides, at best,\na description of the development of constraining conditions on\nreality\u2019s self-unfolding. But, Schelling argued, the productive\ndynamicity of the process that is being constrained is neither\nincluded nor explained in Hegel\u2019s system, and correctly so,\nsince the latter is necessarily transcendent to conscious human\nthought. From the perspective of contemporary process ontology, the\ndevelopment of German Idealism between 1790 and 1850 in the debate\nbetween Fichte, Hegel, and Schelling displays in instructive ways the\nlimitations of a process metaphysics that puts the occurrence type of\nproductions center-stage and, in particular, understands\ncognition as a production: as a development with a product or result.\nAs pictures are the products of paintings, mental representations\n(thoughts, concepts) were taken to be the quasi-objects that result\nfrom the productive developmental occurrences of perceiving and\nthinking. When we conceive of an occurrence as a production, we\nseparate conceptually between the product and the process generating\nthe product. Thus, productions are precisely the type of occurrences\nthat prevent us from conceiving the dynamic presence of reality in\nitself as \u201cprocess and result rolled into one,\u201d as Hegel\nenvisaged. The metaphilosophical debate between Fichte, Hegel, and\nSchelling, which deeply influenced the further development of\n\u2018continental\u2019 philosophy from Nietzsche to Heidegger to\nDerrida and onwards, can be viewed as ensuing from the assumption that\ncognitions are productions of sorts\u2014if cognitions had been\nassigned another occurrence type, this specific metaphilosophical\ndebate could not have got off the ground.\n\nHegel assumed that the process of reality follows certain principles\nthat can be fathomed by philosophical inquiry. This thesis is the\nhallmark of speculative process metaphysics, which has a\nnumber of adherents also among later process philosophers but has been\nchampioned most explicitly by Alfred N.\n Whitehead\n in his \u201cphilosophy of organism,\u201d worked out during the\nearly decades of the 20th century. The basic unit of reality in\nWhitehead\u2019s system is an event-like entity called \u201cactual\noccasion,\u201d which is the procedural integration or\n\u201cconcrescence\u201d of processes of data transfer\n(\u201cprehensions\u201d) into unities that become new data. Each\nactual occasion is the growing together of the total available\ninformation of the universe at that time, according to certain\nprinciples, repeating and reinforcing certain patterns (\u201ceternal\nobjects\u201d) and thereby creating new ones. Whitehead\u2019s\nprocess metaphysics is arguably the most comprehensive descriptive\nmetaphysical framework we have to date\u2014as Whitehead\u2019s\nfollowers, past and present, have shown, not only can it be used for\nthe interpretation of familiar domains of philosophical concern, but\nit can also provide illuminating descriptions for scientific domains\nwhere other metaphysical theories have little to offer, such as\ndiscourse pragmatics in linguistic typology, the neuro-psychological\nfoundations of value judgments, quantum physics, or measurements in\n astrophysics.[2]\n By refurbishing Plotinus\u2019s idea of divinity coming about in the\nworld\u2019s becoming, Whitehead\u2019s philosophy also provided a\nnew impetus to the philosophy of religion.\n Charles Hartshorne,\n perhaps the most eminent American philosopher of religion of the\nTwentieth century, adopted and expanded Whitehead\u2019s ideas for a\nprocess view of God and developed the position of\n process theism\n in the style of rational speculative process thought. It is important\nto note, however, that while the early followers of Whitehead such as\nHartshorne and Paul Weiss embraced the speculative principles of his\nphilosophy, many present-day Whiteheadians are content to put the\nsystem\u2019s ontological concepts to descriptive use.\n\nOther proponents of speculative process metaphysics between 1850 and\n1950, such as Charles S. Peirce, Samuel Alexander, C. Lloyd Morgan,\nand Andrew Paul Ushenko, contributed two new motives for process\nthought, namely, the philosophical explanation of evolutionary\nprocesses and the philosophical explanation of emergence and\nself-organization. However, they also created an image of process\nmetaphysics that in the eyes of their contemporaries appeared\nmethodologically problematic. The first step of these\nprocess-philosophical enterprises seemed legitimate\nbusiness\u2014surely it was important to identify the limitations of\nmechanistic explanations in science. But it was the second step, the\nendeavor of drafting purely speculative explanations for the direction\nand the origin of emergent evolution, that went against the positivist\ntemper of the time. Such explanations did not sit well with the\nphilosophers who defined and shaped the \u201canalytic\u201d method\nin postwar Anglo-American philosophy. As they rejected any empirical\nclaims that would go beyond what was scientifically proven, and\nassigned to philosophy the more mundane task of analyzing conceptual\ncontents (as well as linguistic and social practices, and phenomenal\nexperiences), they increased the intersubjective verifiability of\nphilosophical claims. But in the course of this important\nmethodological revision the ontological categories of process\nmetaphysics were mostly thrown out wholesale with the bathwater of the\nspeculative explanations these categories were embedded in.\n\nNevertheless, twentieth century speculative process\nmetaphysics is paralleled by an analytic-interpretive strand\nin contemporary process thought. This variety of process thought also\nproceeds from the theoretical intuition that processuality, in its\nvarious modes, is the primary starting point for a philosophical\ndescription of the world or of reality, but does not speculate about\nhow reality develops. Here processuality either is a defining trait of\nthe basic categories postulated for the analysis of common sense and\nscientific reasoning, in the style of analytic philosophy; or\nprocessuality is conveyed in the network of metaphors selected for the\ninterpretation of human experience and the conditions of human\nexistence, in the style of so-called \u2018continental\u2019\nphilosophy. Often contributions to analytic-interpretive processism\nare also placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic\nversus continental methods in contemporary philosophy. The following\nexamples will illustrate this methodological openness of\nnon-speculative contemporary process philosophy.\n\nBased on their analyses of phenomenal experience, the investigations\nof the \u201creflex arc\u201d that were coming out of the psychology\nlaboratory, and an analysis of human social praxis, William James and\nJohn Dewey each developed contributions to a process-based pragmatist\nmetaphysics. James\u2019 process-based account of the self loomed\nless large for the history of process philosophy, until recently at\nleast, than Dewey\u2019s more comprehensive view. Dewey holds that\nall existents are events whose characters we determine by giving them\nmeaning in our interaction. For Dewey meanings are not abstract or\npsychic objects but aspects of human cooperative behavior\u2014in our\ninteractions with the world we create significances and thus determine\nwhat kind of situation occurs. Working from studies of social\ninteraction, George Herbert Mead added to process-based pragmatism the\nthesis that mind emerges from social communicative actions. On the\nside of \u2018continental\u2019 philosophy, Henri Bergson arrived at\na process metaphysics again based on an investigation of phenomenal\nexperience, like James and Dewey. But while Dewey and other\npragmatists put the process-character of being partly into the hand of\nhuman agents and their practical and theoretical interpretations of an\nongoing situation, Bergson argued that the process-character of being\nis precisely out of our cognitive reach, at least in so far as we try\nto conceptualize what we experience. As long as we understand\nconscious experience as a subject-object relation, Bergson pointed\nout, we merely follow the theoretical habits in which we have been\nconditioned by the substance-metaphysical tradition. However, when we\ncarefully attend to what we take in during conscious experience,\nespecially our self-experience, without forcing a conceptualization of\nthat experiential content or the act of experience, we find not a\nrelation and ready-made relata but an interactivity\u2014an ongoing\ninterfacing out of which world and self arise in our\nconceptualizations. In immediate, non-conceptualized experience we\ngrasp the dynamicity of this interfacing as becoming or the flow of\nduration (\u201cdur\u00e9e\u201d), but this felt dynamic content\nof our experience transcends what we can conceptually articulate. As\nsoon as we try to conceptualize what we have grasped in\n\u201cintuition\u201d we turn the continuous complex flow of\nexperience into a sequence of discrete units, into pluralities of\nstates of objects at locations that engender Zeno\u2019s paradoxes of\nmotion, and we transform our entangled being with the world into the\never puzzling opposition of a subject and an object.\n\nMartin Heidegger\u2019s early and late philosophy also presents an\nanalytic-interpretive contribution to process philosophy, without\nspeculative formulations of metaphysical \u2018laws of\ndevelopment,\u2019 but with a view to the metaphilosophical and\npractical implications of process metaphysics. In Sein und\nZeit (1927) Heidegger presents what could be called an\n\u2018adverbial model\u2019 of process metaphysics; based on an\nanalysis of human existence (\u201cDasein\u201d) Heidegger shows\nthat what the metaphysical tradition understood as entities or factors\nstanding in relational constellations\u2014e.g., space, world, self,\nothers, possibility, matter, function, meaning, time\u2014can be\nviewed as \u2018adverbial modifications\u2019 of Dasein, as modes\nand ways in which Dasein occurs, while Dasein itself is the\ninteractivity of \u201cdisclosure\u201d or \u2018taking as.\u2019\nSince Heidegger\u2019s \u2018taking as\u2019 is an understanding\nthat is ineradicably practical, his early philosophy bears certain\naffinities to the pragmatist tendency in twentieth century American\nprocess thought. In Heidegger\u2019s later work, however, human\nunderstanding is no longer the dynamic \u2018locus\u2019 but more a\ndimension of the process of being (\u201cclearing\u201d).\n\nWhile many twentieth century American process thinkers were influenced\nby Whitehead, some turned elsewhere or went their own ways. For\nexample, W. H. Sheldon championed a largely dialectical view of the\ndynamic nature of reality with process as a principle of conflict\nresolution. Wilfrid Sellars, one of the great figures in post-war\nanalytical philosophy, worked out what appears to be the first\nconsistently nominalist and naturalist system ever developed in the\nhistory of Western philosophy; this is often overlooked, however,\nsince the system relies on a process ontology that Sellars only\nbriefly sketched but never elaborated. Naturalism implies a nominalist\naccount of properties, Sellars argued, which in turn can only succeed\nif we take qualia to be aspects of processes\u2014by categorizing\nblue as sensing-blue-ly, we can make better sense of\nhow physical processes engender sensory contents (Sellars 1981). With\nthe envisaged process-based solution to the body-sensory problem,\nwhich in many ways anticipates current ideas of \u201cembodied\ncognition,\u201d Sellars could further suggest a new process-based\nre-interpretation of intentionality. Any kind of content, Sellars\nargued, from the lowliest sensory content in bacteria to the\nnorm-governed contents of conceptual experience to the contents of\nscientific theories, is nothing else but a way of\nfunctioning. Taking over from Sellars the idea that content\nis function, present-day functionalist theories of mind and cognition\ntypically fail to acknowledge Sellars and thereby miss the decisive\nelement for a successful functionalist \u2018reduction\u2019 of\nintentionality and the mental, namely, that the reductive basis,\nfunctions, are not static input-output tables but ongoing processes in\nnatural systems that realize, in this ongoingness, normative\nsocio-cultural practices (Seibt 2016). Recently American process\nmetaphysics gained another important voice in Nicholas Rescher who,\nlike Sellars, consistently pursued a systematic approach in\nphilosophy. Rescher made important contributions to all\nphilosophical disciplines; originally these were framed as components\nof a system of \u201cmethodological pragmatism\u201d and\n\u201cpragmatic idealism\u201d. In the mid-1990s, however, Rescher\nsketched a process metaphysical embedding for his system, using\nfamiliar philosophical terminology, and thus presented the first\nsystematic overview of the explanatory potential of a non-Whiteheadian\nprocess metaphysics that forfeits technical expenditure and operates\nwith a notion of process that is close to our common-sense\nunderstanding of developments. In parallel, since the past four\ndecades and with increasing intensity, researchers working in the\nintersection of ontology and linguistics, in philosophy of mind and\ncognitive science, in philosophy of biology or of quantum physics,\nhave addressed specific questions in these areas with greater\nattention to types of processes and processual structures. These more\ntargeted investigations will be taken up below.\n\nGenerally speaking, current Western process philosophy has abandoned\nall speculative aspirations and develops the descriptive,\nanalytic-interpretive strand of process thought (the exception might\nbe the use of process metaphysics in areas of philosophy of physics\nwhere physics itself is speculative, see\n footnote 19).\n While interest in processism most recently has increased in analytic\nphilosophy of science, of mind, and of action, process thought is\ncurrently also used to highlight productive affinities between the\ncontinental and analytical trajectories of twentieth century\nmetaphilosophical criticism of traditional metaphysics. Such\nanalytic-continental cross-overs enabled by attention to process can\nalso be observed in philosophy of cognition and in the philosophy of\ntechnology, often combined with alignments with the \u201c4E paradigm\nof cognition\u201d or \u201cpost-phenomenology\u201d, respectively.\nAnother more encompassing exploration across borders, a detailed\nhistorical and systematic comparison between Western and Eastern\nprocess philosophy (e.g.,\n Daoism)\n is an important task yet to be undertaken.\n",
