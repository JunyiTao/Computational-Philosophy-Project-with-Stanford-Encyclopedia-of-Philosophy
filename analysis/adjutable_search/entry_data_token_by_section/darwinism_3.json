    "main_text": "Darwin and Darwinism || Philosophical Problems with Darwin\u2019s Darwinism\n2.3 Philosophical Problems with Darwin\u2019s Darwinism\n\n\nThe answer lies in five philosophically problematic elements of the\ntheory. \n2.3.1 Probability and Chance\n\n First, notice the use of the language of \u2018tendencies\u2019 and\n\u2018frequencies\u2019 in the above principles. Privately, Darwin\nlearned, Herschel had referred to his theory as \u2018the Law of\nhiggledy-piggledy\u2019, presumably a reference to the large element\nplayed in its key principles by chance and probability. Darwin\u2019s\ntheory is, as we would say today, a \u2018statistical\u2019\ntheory. One cannot say that every individual with favorable variation\nv will survive or will leave more offspring than\nindividuals without it; one cannot say that no environment will ever\nsupport all of the offspring produced in a given generation, and thus\nthat there must always be a competitive\nstruggle. These are things that tend to happen due to clearly\narticulated causes, and this allows us to make accurate predictions\nabout trends, at the level of populations, but not to make\nabsolute claims about what must happen in each and every case. Only\nwell after Herschel\u2019s time did philosophers of science become\ncomfortable with the idea of a theory of this sort, and \nthe proper philosophical understanding of such explanations is still\ndebated.\n2.3.2 The Nature, Power and Scope of Selection\n\n  The core of Darwin\u2019s\ntheory is the concept of natural selection. Perhaps because of his use of the term selection, this\ncore element of his theory apparently baffled nearly everyone.\nCould it be, as Lyell, Herschel and Darwin\u2019s great American defender\nAsa Gray would ask, an \u2018intermediate cause\u2019, i.e. a causal\nprinciple instituted and sustained by God?  Or is it, in its very\nnature, the antithesis of such a principle, as his old geology teacher\nSedgwick believed?  Could it possibly create species, or is it, by its\nnature, a negative force, eliminating what has already been created by\nother means?  In one of his copies of On the Origin of\nSpecies, Alfred Russell Wallace crosses out \u2018natural\nselection\u2019 and writes \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 next\nto it. Wallace always felt that \u2018selection\u2019\ninappropriately imported anthropomorphic notions of Nature choosing\npurposefully between variants into natural history. And, in a\ndevastating review, Fleeming Jenkin happily accepted the principle of\nnatural selection but challenged its power to modify an ancestral\nspecies into descendent species, and thus limited its scope to the\nproduction of varieties.  A number of reviewers, even some sympathetic\nones, questioned the possibility of extending the theory to account\nfor the evolution of those characteristics that differentiate humans\nfrom their nearest relatives.\n2.3.3 Selection, Adaptation and Teleology\n\n  Moreover, because Darwin was very fond of describing natural\nselection as a process that worked for the good of each species,\nDarwin\u2019s followers seemed to have diametrically opposed views as to\nwhether his theory eliminated final causes from natural science or\nbreathed new life into them. In either case, there was also serious\ndisagreement on whether this was a good thing or a bad\n thing.[8]\n\n2.3.4 Nominalism and Essentialism\n\n  There is a fundamental philosophical problem with the idea that a\nspecies can undergo a series of changes that will cause it to become\none or more other species.  To illustrate it, look carefully at the\nfirst question that Charles Lyell wishes to address in the second\nvolume of the Principles of Geology:\n\n \u2026first, whether species have a real and permanent existence in nature;\nor whether they are capable, as some naturalists pretend, of being\nindefinitely modified in the course of a long series of generations.\n(Lyell 1831, II. 1)\n\n\nLyell pretty clearly assumes that to allow for evolution is to deny\nthe reality of species. For a species to be \u2018real\u2019, it\nmust have \u2018permanent existence in nature\u2019, or as he puts\nit elsewhere , \u201c\u2026fixed limits beyond which the descendants from\ncommon parents can never deviate from a certain type\u2026\u201d. (Lyell\n1831, II. 23) To accept evolutionary change, on this view, you must\nbecome comfortable with a variety of nominalism about species. And\nDarwin seems to have become\n so.[9]\n\n\n\nHence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to\nthe systematist, as of high importance for us, as being the first step\ntowards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in\nworks on natural history. And I look at varieties which are in any\ndegree more distinct and permanent, as steps leading to more strongly\nmarked and more permanent varieties; and at these latter, as leading\nto sub-species, and to species. (Darwin 1859, 52)\n\n\nPermanence, as applied to species, is for Darwin a relative concept, and there are no fixed\nlimits to variability within a species. Given enough time the\nindividual differences found in all populations can give rise to more permanent and\nstable varieties, these to sub-species, and these to populations that\nsystematists will want to class as distinct species.  Moreover, he\nconcludes the Origin with very strong words on this topic,\nwords bound to alarm his philosophical readers:\n\nSystematists will be able to pursue their labours as at present; but\nthey will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt whether this\nor that form be in essence a species. \u2026In short, we will have to treat\nspecies in the same manner as those naturalists treat genera, who\nadmit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for\nconvenience. This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at\nleast be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and\nundiscoverable essence of the term species. (Darwin 1859, 485)\n\n\nLyell, Herschel, Whewell, Sedgwick and many of Darwin\u2019s contemporaries\ncertainly would not find this a cheering prospect, since they were\nunrepentant essentialists about\n species.[10]\n Members of a species possess a \u2018type\u2019 established in the\noriginal parents, and this type provides \u2018fixed limits\u2019 to\nvariability.  Lyell clearly feels this is an empirically verifiable\nfact\u2014most of chapters 2\u20134 of Principles Vol. II is\ndevoted to presenting the evidence that such \u2018fixed\nlimits\u2019 exist; and after the Origin\u2019s publication this\nevidence was canvassed again in Fleeming Jenkin\u2019s review.  If this is\nso, then species extinction is easy to account for\u2014there are\nfixed limits to a species\u2019 ability to track environmental\nchange.  But a naturalistic account of species origination is more\ndifficult, since there will need to be, in sexually reproducing\nspecies, a natural production of a new pair of parents with a new\ntype. On the other hand, to adopt the sort of nominalism that Darwin seems to be advocating in the above quotations has undesirable consequences as well. How\nare we to formulate objective principles of classification?  What sort\nof a science of animals and plants will be possible if there are no\nfixed laws relating their natures to their characteristics and\nbehaviors?  A good deal of chapter 2 of Darwin\u2019s Origin is\ndevoted to convincing the reader that current best practice among\nbotanists and zoologists accepts a natural world organized as he is\ninsisting rather than as his opponents claim:\n\nIt must be admitted that many forms, considered by highly competent\njudges as varieties, have so perfectly the character of species that\nthey are ranked by other highly competent judges as good and true\nspecies.  (Darwin 1859, 49)\n\n\nFrom a Darwinian perspective, this is a predictable consequence of the\nfact that the organisms we today wish to classify as species are merely the most\nrecent stage of a slow, gradual evolutionary process. Organisms within\na genus have common ancestors, perhaps relatively recent common\nancestors; some naturalists may see ten species with a few varieties\nin each; others may rank some of the varieties as species and divide the\nsame genus into twenty species. Both classifications may be done with the\nutmost objectivity and care by skilled observers. As systematists like\nto say, some of us are \u2018lumpers\u2019, some of us are\n\u2018splitters\u2019. Reality is neither.\n2.3.5 Tempo and Mode of Evolutionary Change\n\n  The question of nominalism versus realism regarding species points toward a final\naspect of Darwin\u2019s theory with which many of those otherwise\nsympathetic to him disagreed, his gradualism. For apart from the\nquestion of whether his views entailed \u2018nominalism\u2019 about\nnatural kinds, they do seem to reflect a belief that the evolutionary\nprocess must be a slow and gradual one. It is perhaps here that we see\nthe most lasting impact of Darwin\u2019s careful study of Charles Lyell\u2019s\nPrinciples of Geology while on H.M.S. Beagle. I stress slow\nand gradual, for it is clear that one could have a slow\nbut non-gradual evolutionary process (perhaps the long periods of\nevolutionary stasis punctuated by geologically rapid periods of\nspeciation postulated by Eldridge and Gould\u2019s \u2018punctuated\nequilibrium model\u2019 is such); and one could have a rapid but\ngradual one (for example the process George Gaylord Simpson\nlabeled \u2018adaptive radiation\u2019, where a population migrates\nto a location with a variety of unexploited niches, and rapidly\nevolves to exploit them). Darwin stresses over and over again that he\nconceives of natural selection \u2018adding up infinitely small\nvariations\u2019, and that he imagines the process of speciation to\ntake place over a very long period of time.\n\n\nOne of the strongest arguments for insisting that\n\u2018Darwinism\u2019 as it is used today is isomorphic to Darwin\u2019s\nDarwinism, as Gayon puts it, is that each of these questions is still\nhotly debated, and has been throughout the theory\u2019s history.  With all\nof the amazing changes that have been wrought by the genetic,\nbiochemical, and molecular revolutions, with the development of\nmathematical models of population genetics and ecology, of\nsophisticated techniques for both field and laboratory investigation\nof evolutionary processes, and of cladistic analysis in systematics,\nit nevertheless remains true that one can find evolutionary biologists\nwho adhere to Darwin\u2019s Darwinism, and are recognized as doing so by\nboth themselves and their critics.  In the next section of this\narticle, I will develop a portrait of contemporary Darwinism around\neach of these contested features. \n\n\nBy the same token, however, Darwinism has evolved.  As one example of\nthis truth, think for a moment of contemporary debates about the\nnature of selection. The problems people had with natural selection in\nthe 19th century continue to be problematic, but there are\na variety of problems that were either not discussed, or discussed\nvery differently, in the 19th century. Can, and does,\nnatural selection work at levels other than the level of Darwin\u2019s\nfocus, individual organisms; is there a non-vacuous way to formulate\nthe theory abstractly; how are we to understand the relationships\nbetween the concepts of fitness, selection and adaptation?  How strong\nare the constraints on the selection process, and what sorts of\nconstraints are there?  Are there other motors of evolutionary change\nbesides selection, and if so, how important are they?  In particular,\nhow important is \u2018drift\u2019, and how are we to differentiate\nit from selection?\n",
