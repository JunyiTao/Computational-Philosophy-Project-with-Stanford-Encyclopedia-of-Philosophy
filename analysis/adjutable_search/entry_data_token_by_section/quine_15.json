    "main_text": "Metaphysics Naturalized || Metaphysical Claims\n5.2 Metaphysical Claims\n\nQuine\u2019s regimented theory, then, is the sum total of our\nknowledge, the best that we have, reformulated so as to fit into the\nframework of first-order logic. The extra-logical vocabulary consists\nonly of predicates. All metaphysical questions can thus be boiled down\nto two: What objects do the variables range over? and: What sorts of\nprimitive predicates are to be admitted?\n\nTo the first of these questions Quine offers a straightforward answer:\nhis ontology consists of physical objects and sets. We will say a\nlittle more about each. He counts as a physical object the matter\noccupying any portion of space-time, however scattered the portion and\nhowever miscellaneous the occupants; such an object need not be what\nhe calls a \u201cbody\u201d, such as a person or a tree or a\nbuilding (see 1981, 13). He briefly entertains the idea that we could\nmanage without postulating matter at all, simply using sets of\nspace-time points, where these are understood as sets of quadruples of\nreal numbers, relative to some co-ordinate system\u2014that is, an\nontology of abstract objects only. He seems to see no knock-down\nargument against this but abandons it, perhaps because the gain is too\nsmall to justify the magnitude of the departure from our ordinary\nviews. That he is willing to consider such a view, and take it\nseriously, shows something about his general attitude.\n\nBesides physical objects, Quine\u2019s ontology includes sets. Our\nordinary (unregimented) scientific theories require mathematical\nentities (numbers, functions, and so on). Set-theory enables us to\ndefine all those mathematical entities, and many non-mathematical\nentities, in clear and economical fashion; hence regimented theory\nadmits sets. Quine is often said to put forward an\n\u201cindispensability argument\u201d (sometimes known as \u201cthe\nQuine-Putnam indispensability argument\u201d) for the existence of\nmathematical entities. (And thus, it might be said, for Platonism,\nthough that is not a term that Quine favors.) The argument has been\nwell summed-up like this: \u201cthe indispensability of mathematics\nto empirical science gives us good reason to believe in the existence\nof mathematical entities\u201d (Quine 1976, 1991; see also the\nintroduction to the entry on\n indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics).\n Taken very narrowly, it is correct to say that Quine endorses this\nargument. Our ordinary theories employ mathematical entities, and so\nregimented theory must give us some way of achieving the same effect;\nadmitting sets into our ontology is Quine\u2019s preferred method.\nBut ascribing that argument to Quine may be misleading if doing so is\ntaken to imply that he holds that there is some special problem about\nthe ontological status of sets, or mathematical entities, or abstract\nobjects in general, and that he employs the indispensability argument\nto solve that problem. For the mature Quine, there is no more of a\nproblem with realism about abstract entities than there is with\nrealism about concrete objects; indeed the distinction between the\nabstract and the concrete plays no significant role in his mature\nthought (see 1960, 233).  All questions of existence and reality\nare to be settled in the same way: entities exist if and only if the\nquantifiers of regimented theory range over them. \n\nQuine does not accept the existence of any abstract objects apart from\nsets. His ontology thus excludes other alleged abstracta, such as\nproperties, propositions (as distinct from sentences), and merely\npossible entities. The chief reason for his denial of the existence of\nsuch alleged entities is that he finds their identity-criteria\nunclear; he holds, quite generally, that we should not postulate\nentities without having clear identity-criteria for them. (This is the\nview that he sums up in the slogan \u201cno entity without\nidentity\u201d; see (1969, 23) and elsewhere.) Doing so would\nthreaten the clarity and definiteness which the notion of identity\nbrings to theory; local gains from postulating, say, propositions are\nnot worth this global loss. (For a contrary view about properties, see\nArmstrong 1980.)\n\nRegimented theory also has no place for mental entities, most\nobviously minds, if those are taken to be distinct from physical\nentities. The qualification is important. Many mental entities can be\nadmitted as special cases of physical objects. Thus my act of thinking\nabout Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem at a particular time can simply be\nidentified with my body during that period of time (see 1995, 87f.).\nThe things that we might want to say about my act of thinking (that it\nwas inspired, or stupid, or what have you) can simply be reconstrued\nas predicates true or false of physical objects. This is the view\nsometimes known as anomalous monism or as token-token identity theory,\nas distinct from type-type identity theory (see 1960, \u00a754, and\nDavidson 1980). I may think of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem  at\nmany times, over the years, and on each occasion that act is\nidentified with the physical state that I am in at the time.\nToken-token identity theory does not claim that these physical states\nhave anything in particular in common, still less that all acts of\nthinking about the theorem, including those of other people, have\nsomething in common. There is no claim that each act of thinking about\nthe theorem can be identified with, e.g. a repeatable pattern of the\nfiring of brain cells (hence the monism is \u2018anomalous\u2019).\nIt is enough for Quine\u2019s purposes that each particular act of\nthinking can be identified with a physical object. This ontological\nphysicalism might seem almost trivial; Quine speaks of it as\n\u201c[e]ffortless monism \u2026 form without substance\u201d\n(1995, 85). The view does, however, exclude disembodied minds and\nmental entities; Quine thinks that is no loss. Note that the view can\nbe construed either as eliminating mental entities or simply as\nidentifying them with physical objects. Quine prefers the latter\nphrasing but thinks there is no real difference here; cf. 1960,\n265.\n\nOn the issue of the admissibility of predicates, Quine\u2019s\nphysicalism is more complicated. (This is in keeping with his general\nidea that we can think of the predicates, rather than the ontology, as\n\u201cwhere the metaphysical action is\u201d; 1976, 504). The\nrequirement here is that the difference between a predicate\u2019s\nbeing true of a given object and its being false of it should, in all\ncases, be a physical difference: \u201cnothing happens in the world,\nnot the flutter of an eyelid, not the flicker of a thought, without\nsome redistribution of microphysical states\u2026. physics can\nsettle for nothing less\u201d (1981, 98). If a predicate such as\n\u201c\u2026is thinking about Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem\u201d\npicks out genuine events in the world then there is a physical\ndifference between its being true of a person and its not being true\nof them: a fact of the matter.\n\nA difficulty in making sense of this is that the idea of a\nphysical fact is not definitively specifiable. To tie the\nidea too closely to current physics would rule out fundamental changes\nin that subject; to leave it floating free might seem to allow\nanything at all to qualify. But clearly Quine does not mean just any\nsubject that someone might call by the name \u201cPhysics\u201d. He\nhas in mind a subject continuous with our physics, alike or superior\nin its coherence and in its explanatory power. (In particular, it\nwould not have \u201can irreducibly psychological annex\u201d:\n1986a, 403f.). If phenomena occurred which could not be explained by\nany theory of that kind, then Quine\u2019s physicalism would go by\nthe board.\n\nThe most controversial application of this view is to mental\nphenomena. Within that realm, Quine focuses on attributions of\npropositional attitudes, statements that so-and-so believes that\nsuch-and-such, or hopes that, or fears that, etc. (One reason for this\nfocus may be that his interest is primarily in human knowledge;\nanother that some other mental states, such as pain, can perhaps be\naccounted for by identifying them with certain types of\nneurophysiological events.)\n\nPropositional attitudes also raise a different kind of issue.\nAttributions of such attitudes violate extensionality. If Mary is the\nDean, still Tom\u2019s believing that the Dean sings well is not the\nsame as his believing that Mary sings well, since her accession to the\nDeanship may be unknown to him. Quine escapes this sort of problem by\ntaking an attribution of belief to express a relation between the\nbeliever and a sentence, understood to be, in the usual case,\nin the language of the ascriber (not the language of the believer,\nwhere the languages differ).\n\nIt is worth noting the idea of another sense of belief-ascription\nwhich would not be vulnerable even prima facie problems of\nextensionality: so-called de re belief, as distinct from\nde dicto belief. In the 1950s Quine argued that there must be\nsuch a sense. In the late 1960s, however, he abandoned the idea, for\nlack of clear standards of when it is correct to ascribe a de\nre belief to someone. (See Quine 1956 for a statement of the\ndistinction, and Quine 1973 for retraction.) Other philosophers,\nhowever, continue to hold the idea. (See, for example, Kaplan 1968,\nKripke 1979.)\n\nConstruing attributions of belief as statements of attitudes towards\nsentences gives them a syntax and an ontology that Quine can accept.\nThat does not, however, show that the idiom \u201cA believes\nthat p\u201d satisfies his physicalistic criterion, i.e.\nthat all statements of this form correspond to (physical) facts. The\nmatter is complicated. Quine certainly accepts that most uses of this\nidiom are factual. The relevant facts are neurophysiological states of\nthe person concerned, and those states are causally connected with\nactions which the person performs, or would perform under certain\ncircumstances, and which we would count as manifestations of the\nbelief, or lack of belief. (Assenting or dissenting when asked is one\nsuch action, but only one among a myriad.) In cases where we have\nevidence for or against the ascription of a belief to someone, the\nevidence consists in behaviour and there are presumably\nneurophysiological states which explain the behaviour. Those states\nare not in practice specifiable in neurophysiological terms.\nNevertheless, the person\u2019s being in those states is the physical\nfact in which the truth of the ascription consists. Even where there\nis no behaviour of the relevant kind, there may still be dispositions\nto behave in those ways under certain unrealized circumstances. The\ndispositions are the physical states in which the truth of the\nascription consists. So in most cases where we ascribe belief, there\nis a fact of the matter which makes the ascription true or false.\n(More on dispositions a few paragraphs hence.)\n\nThe belief idiom, however, also lends itself to use in other cases,\nwhere there is no fact of the matter. These are not merely cases in\nwhich we have no evidence. They are cases in which no behavioural\ntests which we might have carried out would have supplied evidence,\ncases in which there simply is nothing in the subject\u2019s\nneurophysiology, and hence nothing in their actual or potential\nbehaviour, which would decide the matter. Quine puts the point like\nthis: \u201cSome beliefs, perhaps belief in the essential nobility of\nman qua man, are\u2026 not readily distinguishable from mere lip\nservice, and in such cases there is no fact of the matter\u2026. But\nmost attributions or confessions of belief do make sense\u2026. The\nstates of belief, where real, are\u2026 states of nerves.\u201d\n(1986a, 429)\n\nQuine explicitly acknowledges that we could not in practice manage\nwithout idioms of propositional attitude, and that most uses of such\nidioms are entirely unobjectionable. But such idioms allow the\nformation of sentences which do not correspond to facts of the matter.\nFor that reason, Quine excludes them from regimented theory; they are\nnot be used when we are concerned with \u201climning the true and\nultimate structure of reality\u201d (1960, 221). (Some philosophers\nmight insist: \u2018Either you accept the concept of belief or you\ndon\u2019t\u2019. Quine would not agree; see 1986e for closely\nrelated remarks about the idea of knowing who someone is.)\n\nA somewhat similar point can be made about subjunctive or\ncounterfactual conditionals. Some are factual, but the general\ncounterfactual idiom allows for the formation of sentences which are\nnot factual. Like propositional attitudes, counterfactual conditionals\nhave an important role in our practical lives. They are also closely\nconnected with dispositions which, as we have seen, play a central\nrole in Quine\u2019s account of language and how it is learnt. The\nconnection is easily seen: to call an object fragile is to say that it\nwould break if it were dropped onto a hard surface\nfrom a significant height.\n\nQuine does not accept the general counterfactual idiom, \u201cif\nX were to happen then Y would happen\u201d, as part\nof regimented theory. As in the case of belief, the unrestricted use\nof this idiom allows us to form sentences whose truth-conditions are,\nat best, unclear. A famous example is the pair, presumably alluding to\nthe Korean war of the early 1950s: \u201cIf Caesar were in charge he\nwould use the atom bomb\u201d; \u201cIf Caesar were in charge he\nwould use catapults\u201d (see Quine 1960, 222); they seem equally\nplausible but they cannot both be true (for a response, see Lewis\n1973). In such cases, we have no reason to think that some (physical)\nfact is being claimed. Many dispositions, however, are perfectly\nacceptable by Quinean standards. To call the glass fragile is to\nattribute to it a structure which would lead its breaking under\ncertain circumstances; the structure is a physical state, even if we\ncannot in practice specify it in physical terms.\n\nQuine claims that the dispositions he relies on in his account of\nlanguage are like the case of fragility rather than the case of\nCaesar. The disposition to assent to an observation sentence when\nreceiving certain stimulations is a physical state of the person\nconcerned; in particular, presumably, of his or her brain. The claim\nthat a given person has such a disposition is thus a claim about the\nstate of a physical object. It is, moreover, a claim that we can test,\nat least under favourable conditions. There is no reason to exclude it\nfrom regimented theory.\n\nAnother idiom which Quine famously excludes from regimented theory is\nthat of modality, statements that such-and-such must be the\ncase, or cannot be the case, and so on. Such idioms have been\nthe subject of much discussion on the part of Quine and (especially)\nhis critics; the discussion here will be very brief. Technically,\nthere are similarities with the case of belief. There is prima\nfacie violation of extensionality which can, however, be avoided\nby taking necessity to apply to sentences; some philosophers have\nclaimed that there is a de re sense of necessity which does\nnot lead to even prima facie violations of extensionality.\nQuine allows that modal terms have a legitimate ordinary language use\n(\u2018possible\u2019 is sometimes used to mean something like: we\ncan\u2019t rule it out; see 1966, ch. 10). But his attitude towards\nthe philosophical use of the idea of modality, dividing truths into\nthe necessary and the possible, is far less sympathetic than his\nattitude towards belief; he is particularly unsympathetic towards the\nidea of de re necessity, which he sees as requiring\n\u201cAristotelian essentialism\u201d (Quine 1953, 155).\n\nWhat frames these critical points about necessity is that Quine holds\nthat regimented theory, the best and most objective statement of our\nknowledge, simply has no need for that notion. The benefit of\nincluding such idioms in regimented theory is not worth the cost in\nunclarity that it would bring.\n",
