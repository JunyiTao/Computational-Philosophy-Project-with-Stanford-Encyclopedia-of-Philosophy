    "main_text": "Approaches to AI || Logic-Based AI: Some Surgical Points\n3.2 Logic-Based AI: Some Surgical Points\n\nReasoning based on classical deductive logic is monotonic; that is, if\n\\(\\Phi\\vdash\\phi\\), then for all \\(\\psi\\), \\(\\Phi\\cup\n\\{\\psi\\}\\vdash\\phi\\). Commonsense reasoning is not monotonic. While\nyou may currently believe on the basis of reasoning that your house is\nstill standing, if while at work you see on your computer screen that\na vast tornado is moving through the location of your house, you will\ndrop this belief. The addition of new information causes previous\ninferences to fail. In the simpler example that has become an AI\nstaple, if I tell you that Tweety is a bird, you will infer that\nTweety can fly, but if I then inform you that Tweety is a penguin, the\ninference evaporates, as well it should. Nonmonotonic (or defeasible)\nlogic includes formalisms designed to capture the mechanisms\nunderlying these kinds of examples. See the separate entry on\n logic and artificial intelligence,\n which is focused on nonmonotonic reasoning, and reasoning about time\nand change. It also provides a history of the early days of\nlogic-based AI, making clear the contributions of those who founded\nthe tradition (e.g., John McCarthy and Pat Hayes; see their seminal\n1969 paper). \n\nThe formalisms and techniques of logic-based AI have reached a level\nof impressive maturity \u2013 so much so that in various academic and\ncorporate laboratories, implementations of these formalisms and\ntechniques can be used to engineer robust, real-world software. It is\nstrongly recommend that readers who have an interest to learn where AI\nstands in these areas consult (Mueller 2006), which provides, in one\nvolume, integrated coverage of nonmonotonic reasoning (in the form,\nspecifically, of circumscription), and reasoning about time and change\nin the situation and event calculi. (The former calculus is also\nintroduced by Thomason. In the second, timepoints are included, among\nother things.) The other nice thing about (Mueller 2006) is that the\nlogic used is multi-sorted first-order logic (MSL), which has\nunificatory power that will be known to and appreciated by many\ntechnical philosophers and logicians (Manzano 1996). \n\nWe now turn to three further topics of importance in AI. They are:\n\n The overarching scheme of logicist AI, in the context of the\nattempt to build intelligent artificial agents. \n Common Logic and the intensifying quest for interoperability.\n\n A technique that can be called encoding down, which can\nallow machines to reason efficiently over knowledge that, were it not\nencoded down, would, when reasoned over, lead to paralyzing\ninefficiency. \n\n\nThis trio is covered in order, beginning with the first.\n\nDetailed accounts of logicist AI that fall under the agent-based\nscheme can be found in (Lenat 1983, Lenat & Guha 1990, Nilsson\n1991, Bringsjord & Ferrucci\n 1998).[26].\n The core idea is that an intelligent agent receives percepts from the\nexternal world in the form of formulae in some logical system (e.g.,\nfirst-order logic), and infers, on the basis of these percepts and its\nknowledge base, what actions should be performed to secure the\nagent\u2019s goals. (This is of course a barbaric simplification.\nInformation from the external world is encoded in formulae,\nand transducers to accomplish this feat may be components of the\nagent.) \n\nTo clarify things a bit, we consider, briefly, the logicist view in\nconnection with arbitrary logical systems\n \\(\\mathcal{L}_{X}\\).[27]\n We obtain a particular logical system by setting \\(X\\) in the\nappropriate way. Some examples: If \\(X=I\\), then we have a system at\nthe level of FOL [following the standard notation from model theory;\nsee e.g. (Ebbinghaus et al. 1984)]. \\(\\mathcal{L}_{II}\\) is\nsecond-order logic, and \\(\\mathcal{L}_{\\omega_I\\omega}\\) is a\n\u201csmall system\u201d of infinitary logic (countably infinite\nconjunctions and disjunctions are permitted). These logical systems\nare all extensional, but there are intensional ones as\nwell. For example, we can have logical systems corresponding to those\nseen in standard propositional modal logic (Chellas 1980). One\npossibility, familiar to many philosophers, would be propositional\nKT45, or\n \\(\\mathcal{L}_{KT45}\\).[28]\n In each case, the system in question includes a relevant alphabet\nfrom which well-formed formulae are constructed by way of a formal\ngrammar, a reasoning (or proof) theory, a formal semantics, and at\nleast some meta-theoretical results (soundness, completeness, etc.).\nTaking off from standard notation, we can thus say that a set of\nformulas in some particular logical system \\(\\mathcal{L}_X\\),\n\\(\\Phi_{\\mathcal{L}_X}\\), can be used, in conjunction with some\nreasoning theory, to infer some particular formula\n\\(\\phi_{\\mathcal{L}_X}\\). (The reasoning may be deductive, inductive,\nabductive, and so on. Logicist AI isn\u2019t in the least restricted\nto any particular mode of reasoning.) To say that such a situation\nholds, we write \n\n    \\[\n    \\Phi_{\\mathcal{L}_X} \\vdash_{\\mathcal{L}_X} \\phi_{\\mathcal{L}_X}\n    \\]\n\n \n\nWhen the logical system referred to is clear from context, or when we\ndon\u2019t care about which logical system is involved, we can simply\nwrite \n\n    \\[\n    \\Phi \\vdash \\phi\n    \\]\n\n \n\nEach logical system, in its formal semantics, will include objects\ndesigned to represent ways the world pointed to by formulae in this\nsystem can be. Let these ways be denoted by \\(W^i_{{\\mathcal{L}_X}}\\).\nWhen we aren\u2019t concerned with which logical system is involved,\nwe can simply write \\(W^i\\). To say that such a way models a formula\n\\(\\phi\\) we write \n\n    \\[\n    W_i \\models \\phi\n    \\]\n\n \n\nWe extend this to a set of formulas in the natural way:\n\\(W^i\\models\\Phi\\) means that all the elements of \\(\\Phi\\) are true on\n\\(W^i\\). Now, using the simple machinery we\u2019ve established, we\ncan describe, in broad strokes, the life of an intelligent agent that\nconforms to the logicist point of view. This life conforms to the\nbasic cycle that undergirds intelligent agents in the AIMA\nsense. \n\nTo begin, we assume that the human designer, after studying the world,\nuses the language of a particular logical system to give to our agent\nan initial set of beliefs \\(\\Delta_0\\) about what this world is like.\nIn doing so, the designer works with a formal model of this world,\n\\(W\\), and ensures that \\(W\\models\\Delta_0\\). Following tradition, we\nrefer to \\(\\Delta_0\\) as the agent\u2019s (starting) knowledge\nbase. (This terminology, given that we are talking about the\nagent\u2019s beliefs, is known to be peculiar, but it\npersists.) Next, the agent ADJUSTS its knowlege base to produce\na new one, \\(\\Delta_1\\). We say that adjustment is carried out by way\nof an operation \\(\\mathcal{A}\\); so\n\\(\\mathcal{A}[\\Delta_0]=\\Delta_1\\). How does the adjustment process,\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\), work? There are many possibilities. Unfortunately,\nmany believe that the simplest possibility (viz.,\n\\(\\mathcal{A}[\\Delta_i]\\) equals the set of all formulas that can be\ndeduced in some elementary manner from \\(\\Delta_i\\)) exhausts\nall the possibilities. The reality is that adjustment, as\nindicated above, can come by way of any mode of reasoning\n\u2013 induction, abduction, and yes, various forms of deduction\ncorresponding to the logical system in play. For present purposes,\nit\u2019s not important that we carefully enumerate all the options.\n\n\nThe cycle continues when the agent ACTS on the environment, in\nan attempt to secure its goals. Acting, of course, can cause changes\nto the environment. At this point, the agent SENSES the\nenvironment, and this new information \\(\\Gamma_1\\) factors into the\nprocess of adjustment, so that\n\\(\\mathcal{A}[\\Delta_1\\cup\\Gamma_1]=\\Delta_2\\). The cycle of SENSES\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) ADJUSTS \\(\\Rightarrow\\) ACTS continues to produce\nthe life \\(\\Delta_0,\\Delta_1,\\Delta_2,\\Delta_3,\\ldots,\\) \u2026 of\nour agent. \n\nIt may strike you as preposterous that logicist AI be touted as an\napproach taken to replicate all of cognition. Reasoning over\nformulae in some logical system might be appropriate for\ncomputationally capturing high-level tasks like trying to solve a math\nproblem (or devising an outline for an entry in the Stanford\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy), but how could such reasoning apply to\ntasks like those a hawk tackles when swooping down to capture\nscurrying prey? In the human sphere, the task successfully negotiated\nby athletes would seem to be in the same category. Surely, some will\ndeclare, an outfielder chasing down a fly ball doesn\u2019t prove\ntheorems to figure out how to pull off a diving catch to save the\ngame! Two brutally reductionistic arguments can be given in support of\nthis \u201clogicist theory of everything\u201d approach towards\ncognition. The first stems from the fact that a complete proof\ncalculus for just first-order logic can simulate all of Turing-level\ncomputation (Chapter 11, Boolos et al. 2007). The second justification\ncomes from the role logic plays in foundational theories of\nmathematics and mathematical reasoning. Not only are foundational\ntheories of mathematics cast in logic (Potter 2004), but there have\nbeen successful projects resulting in machine verification of ordinary\nnon-trivial theorems, e.g., in the\n Mizar project\n alone around 50,000 theorems have been verified (Naumowicz and\nKornilowicz 2009). The argument goes that if any approach to AI can be\ncast mathematically, then it can be cast in a logicist form. \n\nNeedless to say, such a declaration has been carefully considered by\nlogicists beyond the reductionistic argument given above. For example,\nRosenschein and Kaelbling (1986) describe a method in which logic is\nused to specify finite state machines. These machines are used at\n\u201crun time\u201d for rapid, reactive processing. In this\napproach, though the finite state machines contain no logic in the\ntraditional sense, they are produced by logic and inference. Real\nrobot control via first-order theorem proving has been demonstrated by\nAmir and Maynard-Reid (1999, 2000, 2001). In fact, you can\n download\n version 2.0 of the software that makes this approach real for a Nomad\n200 mobile robot in an office environment. Of course, negotiating an\noffice environment is a far cry from the rapid adjustments an\noutfielder for the Yankees routinely puts on display, but certainly\nit\u2019s an open question as to whether future machines will be able\nto mimic such feats through rapid reasoning. The question is open if\nfor no other reason than that all must concede that the constant\nincrease in reasoning speed of first-order theorem provers is\nbreathtaking. (For up-to-date news on this increase, visit and monitor\nthe\n TPTP site.)\n There is no known reason why the software engineering in question\ncannot continue to produce speed gains that would eventually allow an\nartificial creature to catch a fly ball by processing information in\npurely logicist fashion. \n\nNow we come to the second topic related to logicist AI that warrants\nmention herein: common logic and the intensifying quest for\ninteroperability between logic-based systems using different logics.\nOnly a few brief comments are\n offered.[29]\n Readers wanting more can explore the links provided in the course of\nthe summary. \n\nOne standardization is through what is known as\n Common Logic\n (CL), and variants thereof. (CL is published as an\n ISO standard\n \u2013 ISO is the International Standards Organization.)\nPhilosophers interested in logic, and of course logicians, will find\nCL to be quite fascinating. From an historical perspective, the advent\nof CL is interesting in no small part because the person spearheading\nit is none other than Pat Hayes, the same Hayes who, as we have seen,\nworked with McCarthy to establish logicist AI in the 1960s. Though\nHayes was not at the original 1956 Dartmouth conference, he certainly\nmust be regarded as one of the founders of contemporary AI.) One of\nthe interesting things about CL, at least as we see it, is that it\nsignifies a trend toward the marriage of logics, and programming\nlanguages and environments. Another system that is a logic/programming\nhybrid is\n Athena,\n which can be used as a programming language, and is at the same time\na form of MSL. Athena is based on formal systems known as\ndenotational proof languages (Arkoudas 2000). \n\nHow is interoperability between two systems to be enabled by CL?\nSuppose one of these systems is based on logic \\(L\\), and the other on\n\\(L'\\). (To ease exposition, assume that both logics are first-order.)\nThe idea is that a theory \\(\\Phi_L\\), that is, a set of formulae in\n\\(L\\), can be translated into CL, producing \\(\\Phi_{CL}\\), and then\nthis theory can be translated into \\(\\Phi_L'\\). CL thus becomes an\ninter lingua. Note that what counts as a well-formed formula in\n\\(L\\) can be different than what counts as one in \\(L'\\). The two\nlogics might also have different proof theories. For example,\ninference in \\(L\\) might be based on resolution, while inference in\n\\(L'\\) is of the natural deduction variety. Finally, the symbol sets\nwill be different. Despite these differences, courtesy of the\ntranslations, desired behavior can be produced across the translation.\nThat, at any rate, is the hope. The technical challenges here are\nimmense, but federal monies are increasingly available for attacks on\nthe problem of interoperability.\n\nNow for the third topic in this section: what can be called\nencoding down. The technique is easy to understand. Suppose\nthat we have on hand a set \\(\\Phi\\) of first-order axioms. As is\nwell-known, the problem of deciding, for arbitrary formula \\(\\phi\\),\nwhether or not it\u2019s deducible from \\(\\Phi\\) is\nTuring-undecidable: there is no Turing machine or equivalent that can\ncorrectly return \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d in the general\ncase. However, if the domain in question is finite, we can encode this\nproblem down to the propositional calculus. An assertion that all\nthings have \\(F\\) is of course equivalent to the assertion that\n\\(Fa\\), \\(Fb\\), \\(Fc\\), as long as the domain contains only these\nthree objects. So here a first-order quantified formula becomes a\nconjunction in the propositional calculus. Determining whether such\nconjunctions are provable from axioms themselves expressed in the\npropositional calculus is Turing-decidable, and in addition, in\ncertain clusters of cases, the check can be done very quickly in the\npropositional case; very quickly. Readers interested in\nencoding down to the propositional calculus should consult recent\n DARPA-sponsored work by Bart Selman.\n Please note that the target of encoding down doesn\u2019t need to be\nthe propositional calculus. Because it\u2019s generally harder for\nmachines to find proofs in an intensional logic than in straight\nfirst-order logic, it is often expedient to encode down the former to\nthe latter. For example, propositional modal logic can be encoded in\nmulti-sorted logic (a variant of FOL); see (Arkoudas & Bringsjord\n2005). Prominent usage of such an encoding down can be found in a set\nof systems known as Description Logics, which are a set of\nlogics less expressive than first-order logic but more expressive than\npropositional logic (Baader et al. 2003). Description logics are used\nto reason about ontologies in a given domain and have been\nsuccessfully used, for example, in the biomedical domain (Smith et al.\n2007). \n",
