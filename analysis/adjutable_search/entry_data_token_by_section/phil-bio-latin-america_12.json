Philosophy and History of Biology\n\nThe discussion of the relationships between philosophy of science and\nhistory of science has a long tradition, as well as distinct\nmetascientific practices that link philosophy of science and history\nof science in various ways. The interrelations between these two\nmetascientific disciplines are ever-changing and are not free of\ntensions. Some of the main authors of the nineteenth and early\ntwentieth centuries, such as William Whewell, Ernst Mach, and Pierre\nDuhem maintained that there was a close relationship between the two,\nin the sense that they understood their philosophical positions were\nbased on reflections made in the history of science, and in order to\ncarry out historical analyses of science one had to possess some\nphilosophical concept of science.\n\nHowever, despite the work of the aforementioned authors, as well as\nthat of \u00c9mile Meyerson and his \u201cCircle\u201d, which\nincluded Alexandre Koyr\u00e9, L\u00e9on Brunschvicg, and\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Metzger, and of \u00c9douard Le Roy, Ernst\nCassirer, Edgar Zilsel, Ludwik Fleck, Abel Rey, Gaston Bachelard, and\nGeorges Canguilhem, among others towards the mid-twentieth century,\nthe conception that philosophy and the history of science are\ndifferent disciplines with little or no mutual influence became\ncrystallized in the received view in the philosophy of\nscience.\n\nAt the same time, however, some philosophers of science, including\nNorwood Russell Hanson, Mary Hesse, and Stephen Toulmin, acknowledged\nthe relevance of history of science for philosophical reflection on\nscience, giving rise to what would become known as the historical\nturn, which was continued in the 1960s, 1970s, and even 1980s by\nThomas Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend, Imre Lakatos, and Larry Laudan. The work\nof these historicist philosophers of science, as well as the attempts\nof other more formalist authors, such as Joseph Sneed, Wolfgang\nStegm\u00fcller, and C. Ulises Moulines, along with the popularization\nof the paraphrasing of Kant\u2019s dictum, contributed to\nrethinking the relationship between the philosophy of science and the\nhistory of science. This dictum was first formulated in two sentences\nby Hanson (1962) and then put together in a single sentence by Lakatos\n(1970): \n\n\nPhilosophy of science without history of science is empty; history of\nscience without philosophy of science is blind.\n\n\nThe discussion of such relationships continued with a questioning of\nthe link developed between the two metascientific subdisciplines,\nwhether it was not more a marriage of convenience than an intimate\nrelationship (Giere 1973), the adoption of the naturalistic\nturn, and the proposal of the so-called confrontation\nmodel (Laudan et al. 1986; Donovan, Laudan, & Laudan 1988)\nand, more recently, the development of the new historical\nepistemology (Lorraine Daston, Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger,\nJ\u00fcrgen Renn; see Feest & Sturm 2011; Braunstein 2012) and the\nso-called integrated history and philosophy of science (Jean\nGayon, Hasok Chang, Jutta Schickore, Theodore Arabatzis, Friedrich\nSteinle; see Arabatzis & Howard 2015).\n\nLinked to these different authors and positions, as well as to those\nin the philosophy of history, such as the dispute of historicism in\nGermany since the second half of the nineteenth century and approaches\ngrounded in conceptual and intellectual history, in Latin America we\nfind historically-minded philosophers of science and\nphilosophically-minded historians of science. Therefore, the region is\ncharacterized by diverse and plural ways of doing research that\nrelates philosophy of biology to history of biology. These approaches\nrange, on a continuum, from those that erroneously do not seem to be\nlinked or relevant to the history of science to those that, also\nerroneously, seem unrelated to philosophy in general and of science in\nparticular. This continuum begins at one extreme with synchronic\nphilosophical analyses of episodes in the history of biology, moves\nthrough diachronic philosophical analyses and\nhistorico-epistemological analyses, and ends at the other extreme with\nconceptual analyses of episodes in the history of biology.\n\nOn the one hand, synchrony and diachrony represent two sides of the\nsame coin. Every synchronic analysis presupposes a rupture within\ntemporal becoming, and every diachronic analysis presupposes\nsynchronic analysis of successive events in time. Analogous to de\nSaussure\u2019s introduction of the synchronic/diachronic\ndistinction, if a historian creates a picture of an event, one does\nnot have the impression of leaving history, and if a philosopher of\nscience carries out a synchronic analysis, they likewise do not leave\nhistory. Thus, even synchronic philosophical analyses are based on\nhistory, namely, on what the philosopher might consider the best\nhistory available, even though they might be incorrect and later\nrevise their decision. Given the inextricable link between synchrony,\ndiachrony, and history, it is not only true that diachronic\nphilosophical analyses of science can contribute to a better\nunderstanding of the history of science; synchronic philosophical\nanalyses can also shed light on some historiographical problems raised\nin the history of science. On the other hand, every historiographic\nnarrative has theoretical presuppositions, even if it claims to be\n\u201cmerely\u201d descriptive or consists of the narrative\ncriticized by Kuhn of a repository of anecdotes or chronology, and of\nwhich historians may or may not be aware.\n\nThus, it is clear that theoretical-philosophical presuppositions play\nan important role in choosing the type of history of science to be\ncarried out, within a range that includes the following: biographical,\nautobiographical, prosopographical, fictional, thematic,\ninstitutional, national, disciplinary, comparative, hypothetical\n(counterfactual), anachronic (Whig or presentist), diachronic,\nexperimental, scientometrical, and conceptual (theoretical,\nphilosophical). The various types of historiographic analyses always\npresuppose some sort of theory about science, though it may be a poor\nor murky one. And in some of the different types of historiographic\nanalyses, e.g., in the conceptual history of science, some general\nphilosophical concept of science and some metascientific concepts\nusually explicated by philosophy, such as scientific concept,\nhypothesis, law and theory, are also presupposed.\n\nFinally, we must bear in mind that there are no clear-cut boundaries\nin the continuum formed by the different modes of doing research\nrelating the philosophy of science to the history of science:\nsynchronic philosophical, diachronic philosophical,\nhistorico-epistemological, and conceptual analyses of episodes in the\nhistory of science. We must also emphasize that even when these\napproaches explicitly adopt different perspectives or conceptions,\nthey may be linked together or combined in various ways. Consider, for\nexample, a classical, historicist, or semantic view of theories, in\nthe case of synchronic philosophical analyses; or a Fleckian,\nPopperian, Kuhnian, Lakatosian, Laudanian, or structuralist approach,\nin the case of diachronic philosophical analyses; or a Duhemian,\nBachelardian, Canguilhemian, Dastonian, Rennian, or Rheinbergerian\nview, in the case of the historical epistemology, both old and\nnew.\n",
