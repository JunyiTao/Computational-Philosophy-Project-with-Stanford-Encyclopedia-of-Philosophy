    "main_text": "Disquotation Again.\n6. Disquotation Again.\n\nBrueckner (2003: 156) considers the following argument:\n\n(A*) If I am a BIV,\nthen it is not the case that my utterances of \u2018Trees are\ngreen\u2019 are true iff trees are green.\n(B*) My utterances of\n\u2018Trees are green\u2019 are true iff trees are\ngreen.\n(C) So, I am not a\nBIV.\n\n\nIn reply to the objection that use of the disquotational premise (B*)\nbegs the question, Brueckner says that the objector would be right to\nreject a defense of (B*) that is based on the claim that since I know\nthat I\u2019m a normal speaker of English, I also know (B*). Such a\nclaim would indeed beg the question, Brueckner says. But he goes on to\nsuggest that knowledge of such disquotational facts as (B*) need not\nbe based on knowledge that one is a normal English speaker. Rather,\nthe former kind of knowledge \u201cis simply part of understanding my\nown language (whatever it is and whatever I am)\u201d (2003:\n157).\n\nIn this reply, Brueckner seems to be relying on the fact that one can\nknow that (B*) expresses a truth, whether or not one is a non-BIV\nspeaker of English or a BIV speaking vat-English. That is simply\nbecause, whatever language is being spoken in uttering (B*), the\nmetalanguage being used contains the object language sentence that\nprovides the relevant truth condition.\n\nBut as Brueckner himself had earlier pointed out (1986: 165; 1995:\n100)), while we can in this manner know that disquotational sentences\nlike (B*) are true, we cannot know which truth is\nbeing expressed until we know which language is being spoken. In this\ncase, if the speaker is a BIV speaking vat-English, then (B*) would\nmean \u201cMy utterances of \u2018trees are green\u2019 are true\niff trees* are green\u201d (where \u2018trees*\u2019 expresses one\nof the three possible types of meanings that Putnam suggests for\n\u2018tree\u2019 in vat-English). So on the assumption that the\nspeaker is a BIV speaking vat-English, premise (B*) would be true.\nHowever, the conclusion (C) of the argument would then mean \u2018I\nam not a BIV*\u2019, and while this conclusion would also be true, it\nis also irrelevant to Putnam\u2019s desired conclusion (in English)\n\u2018I am not a BIV\u2019. Moreover, note that if understood to be\nin vat-English, the premise (A*) would be false.\n\nOn the other hand, if we assume that the speaker is a non-BIV speaking\nEnglish, then premises (A*) and (B*) would both be true, as would the\nconclusion (C). However, the argument in question, though sound, would\nblatantly beg the question. For in order for the speaker to have\nwarrant that premises (A*) and (B*) are both true in the relevant\nsenses, warrant must already be available to the speaker of\n(A*) and (B*) that she is a non-BIV speaking English.\n\nWe should also note that premise (A*) cannot be true if it is spoken\nby a BIV speaking vat-English, since disquotation holds for\nvat-English as well as English. Thus (A*) is true only if spoken by a\nnon-BIV speaking English, and so its use begs the question for the\nsame reason pointed out by Hale (2000) regarding Wright\u2019s (1992)\nreconstruction.\n",
