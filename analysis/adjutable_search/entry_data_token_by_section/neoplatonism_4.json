    "main_text": "Matter\n5. Matter\nWithout light, it would not make any sense to speak of darkness. In\nfact, there would be no such thing as darkness, since darkness is, if\nit is anything, light\u2019s absence and opposite. In the same way as\ndarkness is a by-product of light, so matter, the Neoplatonists\nreasoned, is nothing but a by-product of the dynamic emanation of the\nFirst. In fact, it is the limit at which the energy transmitted in the\nchain of inner and outer activities at the various levels of reality\nexhausts itself and comes to an end. Just as darkness has no capacity\nto make itself visible, in the same way matter no longer has any inner\nactivity that could give rise to a further outer activity. As such, it\nis merely passive, and the eternal process of consecutive production\nof ever lower levels of reality necessarily comes to an end. But\nimportantly for us, it is the realm at which the activity of Soul\ninformed by Consciousness becomes phenomenal and perceptible. It would\nbe wrong to say that matter does not exist at all, or is a nothing.\nAccording to this theory, at any rate, matter exists, but not as a\nseparate ontological principle distinct from the One with effects of\nits own. Rather, it is a fringe phenomenon of the life of the soul, a\nby-product of the activity of higher realms of Being. As such, it is\nno thing, an entirely immaterial and formless non-entity. This\nPlotinian doctrine was destined to raise controversy among later\nNeoplatonists, when it was proposed that matter should at the very\nleast have the property of undefined three-dimensionality.\nAn even more controversial doctrine connected to matter was the\nexplanation of evil. Plotinus had tried to uphold the view, consistent\nwith his entire ontology, that at no point in the great chain of Being\ncoming from above does anything emerge that could be regarded as evil,\nor the cause of evil. Nevertheless, evil, and in particular moral\nevil, is obviously part of our experience of the world, and an\nexplanation had to be given as to where it originated. Plotinus\u2019\nanswer was that evil arises from below, not above, and is intimately\nconnected with matter. Yet importantly, matter is not an independent\nprinciple of evil in any Manichean or Gnostic sense, as it has no\nactive power on its own. Rather, evil arises if and when higher\nbeings, and in particular human beings, direct their attention towards\nthe material world below, instead of the intelligible world above, and\nhave an all-encompassing concern for it. The regard\ndownwards, as it were, rather than upwards towards Consciousness and\nthe divine essences, is what contaminates the soul and renders it\nmorally evil.  Even though it is surprising how much explanatory force\nfor the nature and existence of moral evil this theory affords, it\nremained controversial even among Neoplatonists. Proclus, in the fifth\ncentury, dedicated an entire treatise to repudiating Plotinus on this\npoint.  Proclus abandoned the comforting notion of the essential\ngoodness of humanity and, not unlike Augustine before him, insisted on\nthe real possibility of the moral depravity of the human soul\nqua soul.\n",
