    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nNot a great deal is known of Robert Alyngton\u2019s life. Most of the\ninformation about him comes from Emden 1957\u201359. From 1379 until\n1386, he was fellow of Queens College (the same Oxonian college where\nWyclif started his theological studies in 1363 and Johannes Sharpe\ntaught in the 1390s); he became Magister Artium and, by 1393,\ndoctor of theology. He was chancellor of the University in 1393 and\n1395. In 1382 he preached Wyclif\u2019s religious and political ideas\nin Hampshire (McHardy 1987). He was rector of Long Whatton,\nLeicestershire, where he died by September 1398. \n\nAccording to Emden 1957\u201359 and Ashworth & Spade 1992,\nAlyngton was of considerable repute as a logician. Among his extant\nworks, the following can be mentioned (the most complete list of his\nwritings is found in Bale 1557\u201359 [pp. 519\u201320]):\n\nA commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Categories\n(Litteralis sententia super Praedicamenta Aristotelis\n[henceforward In Cat.]), partially edited in Conti 1993 (pp.\n242\u2013306). (All references are to the pages of this edition or,\nfor the unedited portions, to the ms. London, Lambeth Palace\n393.)\nA treatise on the supposition of terms (Tractatus de\nsuppositionibus terminorum).\nA commentary on the Liber sex principiorum.\nA treatise on the genera of being (Tractatus\ngenerum).\n\n2. Being and Categories\n\nThe point of departure of every realist interpretation of the\nCategories is the notion of being (ens) in its\nrelationship to the ten categories, as Realists considered the\ncategorial table to be a division of beings. Like Burley, Alyngton\naffirms that (i) the division into categories is first of all a\ndivision of things existing outside the mind, and only secondarily of\nthe mental concepts and spoken or written terms which signify them,\nand (ii) things belonging to one categorial field are really distinct\nfrom those belonging to another\u2014for instance, substances are\nreally distinct from quantities, qualities, and relations, quantities\nare really distinct from substances, qualities, and relations, and so\non (In Cat., cap. de numero et sufficientia\npraedicamentorum, Conti pp. 251, 252\u201353).\n\nUnfortunately Alyngton does not define being; yet, what he says about\n(1) the subject of the Categories (the real categorial being\nwhich can be signified by simple expressions, namely terms (In\nCat., cap. de numero et sufficientia praedicamentorum ,\np. 252), and (2) analogy (In Cat., cap. de\naequivocis, ms. London, Lambeth Palace 393, fol. 70r\u2013v)\nseems to entail that, like Wyclif, he also thinks of being as a sort\nof an extramental reality proper to everything (God and creatures;\nsubstances and accidents; universal and individual items; things,\ncollections of things, and states of affairs) according to different\nmodes and degrees.\n\nIn the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, all the realist authors,\nwith the only notable exception of Duns Scotus, regarded categorial\nitems as composed of two main aspects: the inner nature or essence,\nand their peculiar mode of being or of being predicated (modi\nessendi vel praedicandi). They maintained that the categorial\ntable divides categorial items according to their modes of being (or\nof being predicated) and not according to their inner natures (or\nessences). In particular, Thomas Aquinas (Sententia super\nMetaphysicam, liber V, lectio 9) based his method of finding the\nten Aristotelian categories on the differences of modes of being\npredicated, and recognized three fundamental modes of being\npredicated: essentially, proper to substances, when the predication\nindicates what a given thing is; accidentally, proper to quantities,\nqualities, and relatives, when the predication indicates that\nsomething inheres in a subject; and externally, proper to the\nremaining six categories, when the predication indicates that\nsomething which does not inhere in the subject nevertheless affects\nit. On the contrary Albert the Great (Liber de\npraedicamentis, tr. I, cap. 7) and Simon of Faversham\n(Quaestiones super librum Praedicamentorum, q. 12) based\ntheir method of finding the categories on the differences of modes of\nbeing. They admitted two fundamental modes of being: being by itself,\nproper to substance; and being in something else, proper to the nine\ngenera of accidents. The latter was subdivided into being in something\nelse absolutely, proper to quantities and qualities, and being in\nsomething else in virtue of a relation to a third thing (esse ad\naliud), proper to the remaining seven categories. Walter Burley,\nwhose last commentary on the Categories is, along with\nWyclif\u2019s De ente praedicamentali, the main source of\nAlyngton\u2019s commentary on the Categories, recalled two\nways of deducing the ten Aristotelian categories, both based on the\nvarious levels of similarity among their own modes of being. Alyngton\nfollows very closely Burley\u2019s first way of deriving the ten\ncategories. In his opinion, there are two fundamental modes of being\nproper to things: being by itself, which characterizes substances, and\nbeing or inhering in something else, which characterizes accidents.\nThe latter is subdivided into three less general modes: being in\nsomething else in virtue of its matter; being in something else in\nvirtue of its form; and being in something else in virtue of the whole\ncomposite. Something can inhere in something else in virtue of its\nmatter, form, and composite according to three different ways: from\ninside (ab intrinseco), from outside (ab\nextrinseco), and partially from inside and partially from outside\n(partim ab intrinseco et partim ab extrinseco). If something\nis in something else in virtue of its matter and from inside, then it\nis a quantity; if from outside, it is a where; if partially from\ninside and partially from outside, it is an affection. If something is\nin something else in virtue of its form and from inside, then it is a\nquality; if from outside, it is when (quando vel\nquandalitas); if partially from inside and partially from\noutside, it is an action. If something is in something else in virtue\nof the whole composite and from inside, then it is a relation; if from\noutside, it is a possession (habitus); if partially from\ninside and partially from outside, it is a position (In Cat.,\ncap. de numero et sufficientia praedicamentorum, pp.\n252\u201353).\n\nAlyngton\u2019s choice implies an anti-reductionist approach to the\nmatter, which is confirmed by the solution of the problem of what\nproperly falls into the categorial fields. According to the standard\nrealist conception, not only the accidental forms, such as whiteness,\nbut also the compounds they cause when inhering in substances, such as\na white-thing (album), fall into the categories. Burley\nthought that whilst the accidental forms properly fall into the\ncategories, the aggregates made up from a substance and an accidental\nform do not, since they are beings per accidens, wanting in\nreal unity. In his opinion, such an aggregate may be said to fall into\na certain category, the category into which its accidental form falls,\nonly by reduction, in virtue of the accidental form itself. On the\ncontrary, Wyclif maintained that the aggregates built up by a\nsubstance and an accidental form fall per accidens into both\nthe category of substance and the category which the accidental form\nat issue belongs to (cf. Wyclif, De ente praedicamentali,\ncap. 1, pp. 3\u20134). Alyngton combines in an original way the two\nslightly different opinions of Burley and Wyclif. He affirms that a\nthing can be said to belong to a category in a threefold way: by\nitself, by accident (per accidens), and by reduction (per\nreductionem). Something is in a category by itself if and only if\nthe highest genus of that category is predicated by itself and and\ndirectly (in recto) of it (In Cat., cap. de\nnumero et sufficientia praedicamentorum, p. 259). In other words,\nif and only if the highest genus of that category is one of the\nconstitutive elements of the essence of the thing at issue. Accidental\nforms belong per se to the nine categories of accidents\n(In Cat., cap. de relativis, p. 300). Something is\nin a category by accident if and only if it is an aggregate from a\nsubstance and an accidental form. Such aggregates belong per accidens\nboth to the category of substance and to the category in which its\naccidental form is by itself (In Cat., cap. de numero et\nsufficientia praedicamentorum, p. 259; and cap. de\nrelativis, p. 300). Something can be in a category by reduction\nin two different ways: in a broad sense (large) and in a\nstrict sense (stricte). Something is in a category by\nreduction large if and only if it is an aggregate, and the\nhighest genus of a certain category is predicated only indirectly of\nit. Something is in a category by reduction stricte if and\nonly if it is not an aggregate, and, (a) like differences, it is a\ncomponent of the reality of a thing which is in a category by itself,\nbut the highest genus of that category is not predicated of it; or (b)\nit is the privation correlated to a certain property which, in turn,\nis in a category by itself; or (c), like extra-categorial principle\nsuch as God, the unity, and the point, it somehow instantiates the\nmode of being proper to a certain categorial field, but the highest\ngenus of that category is not one of the constitutive elements of the\nessence of that thing (In Cat., cap. de numero et\nsufficientia praedicamentorum, pp. 259\u201360).\n\nFundamental to Alyngton\u2019s deduction of the categories and\nsolution of the problem of what falls into the categorial fields (and\nhow) is a close isomorphism between language (mental, written, and\nspoken) and the world. Like Burley and Wyclif, he was firmly convinced\nthat our thought is modelled on reality itself, so that it reproduces\nreality in all its elements, levels, and inner relations. Therefore,\none of the best ways of understanding the world lay for him in an\naccurate investigation of our notions and conceptual schemes, as they\nshow the structure of the world. A logical consequence of this\nconviction was his strong propensity towards reification: he\nhypostatises the notion of being and considers equivocity, analogy,\nand univocity not only as semantic relations between terms and things,\nbut also as real relations between extra-mental items (In\nCat., cap. de aequivocis, ms. London, Lambeth Palace\n393, fols. 69v\u201370r).\n\nAccording to the common interpretation of the opening passage of the\nCategories, equivocal terms are correlated with more than one\nconcept and refer to a multiplicity of things sharing different\nnatures, whereas univocal terms are correlated with only one concept\nand refer to a multiplicity of things sharing one and the same nature.\nIn his last commentary on the Physics (after 1324), Burley\nhad maintained that the term \u2018being\u2019 is at the same time\nunivocal and equivocal with respect to the categories, as a single\nconcept corresponds to it (broadly speaking univocity), but the\ncategorial items share it in different ways, according to a hierarchy\nof value (broadly speaking equivocity)\u2014see his Expositio in\nlibros octo Physicorum, lib. I, tr. 2, cap. 1, ed. Venice 1501,\nfols. 12vb-13ra. In turn, Wyclif had admitted three main types of\nequivocity: by chance (a casu), analogical, and generic, the\nsecond of which applies to the relationship between being and\ncategories (De ente praedicamentali, cap. 2). Alyngton\nrecognises four main kinds of equivocity: by chance; deliberate (a\nconsilio); analogical; and generic. Equivocals by chance are\nthose things that just happen to have the same name, but with\ndifferent meanings and/or reasons for imposing the name. Those things\nare deliberate equivocals which have distinct natures but the same\nname, and are subordinated to different but correlated concepts. Those\nthings are analogical which share the nature signified by their common\nname in various degrees and/or ways. Generic equivocals are those\nthings which share the same generic nature in the same way, but have\ndistinct specific natures of different absolute value (In\nCat., cap. de aequivocis, fol. 70r-v). So, within\nAlyngton\u2019s system, what differentiates analogy from univocity is\nthe way in which a certain nature (or property) is shared by a set of\nthings: analogous things share it according to different degrees\n(secundum magis et minus, or secundum prius et\nposterius), univocal things share it all in the same manner and\nto the same degree (In Cat., cap. de univocis, fol.\n71v). Alyngton argues that being is not a sort of genus in relation to\nthe ten categories, since it does not manifest their essence, nor is\nit predicated univocally of them; being is analogous in relation to\nthe ten categories. It is the basic stuff of the metaphysical\nstructure of each reality, which possesses it in accordance with its\nown nature and level in the hierarchy of essences (In Cat.,\ncap. de numero et sufficientia praedicamentorum, pp.\n255\u201356).\n3. Universals and Predication\n\nAmong the many kinds of beings (entia) that Alyngton admits,\nthe most important set is that consisting of universal items.\nUniversals are among the most disputed topics in Medieval\nphilosophical literature. Like Wyclif and the other Oxford Realists,\nAlyngton claims that universals fully exist outside the mind and are\nreally identical-to and formally distinct-from the individuals which\ninstantiate them. Like Albert the Great whom he quotes by name,\nAlyngton recognizes three main kinds of universals:\n\nante rem or ideal universals\u2014that is, the ideas in\nGod, the archetypes of all that is;\nin re or formal universals\u2014that is, the common\nnatures shared by individual things; and\npost rem or intentional universals\u2014that is, mental\nsigns of the formal universals.\n\n\nThe ideas in God are the causes of formal universals, and formal\nuniversals are the causes of intentional universals. Furthermore, like\nBurley and Wyclif, Alyngton holds that formal universals actually\nexist (in actu) outside our minds, and not potentially only\n(in potentia) as moderate realists thought (In Cat.,\ncap. de substantia, p. 279)\u2014even if, unlike Burley, he\nmaintains they are really identical with their individuals, for\notherwise it would be impossible to explain, against the Nominalists,\nwhy and how individual substances show different and more or less\nclose kinds of similarity among themselves (In Cat., cap.\nde substantia, pp. 267\u201368).\n\nAccording to Alyngton, who depends here on Avicenna and Wyclif, formal\nuniversals are common natures in virtue of which the individuals that\nshare them are exactly what they are\u2014as the human species is the\nform by which every man formally is a man. Qua natures, they\nare prior, and so indifferent, to any division into universals and\nindividuals. Universality (universalitas or\ncommunicabilitas) is as it were their inseparable property,\nbut not a constitutive mark of the nature itself (In\nCat., cap. de substantia, fol. 101v). As a consequence,\nformal universals can be conceived of in two different manners: as\nfirst intentions or as second intentions. In the former case, they are\nnatures of a certain kind and are identical with their individuals\n(for example, man is the same thing as Socrates). In the latter case,\nthey are properly universals (that is, something that can exist in\nmany things and can be shared by them), and are distinct from their\nindividuals considered qua individuals, because of opposite\nconstitutive principles (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, p. 268). Therefore, universals are really\n(realiter) identical to, but formally (formaliter)\ndistinct from their individuals. In fact, universals are formal causes\nin relation to their individuals, and individuals are material causes\nin relation to their universals. Thus three different kinds of\nentities can be qualified as formal universals:\n\nthe common natures instantiated by individuals\u2014which are\nthings of first intention;\nthe form itself of universality, which belongs to a certain common\nnature when seen in its relation to the individuals\u2014which is a\nthing of second intention; and\nthe thinkability proper to the common nature, by which it is a\npossible object of our mind\u2014that is, the real principle that\nconnects formal universals with mental universals (In Cat.,\ncap. de substantia, p. 277).\n\n\nAlyngton accepts the traditional realistic account of the relationship\nbetween formal universals and individuals, and, like Wyclif, improves\nit by defining its logical structure more accurately, in order to\navoid the inconsistencies stressed by Ockham and his followers.\nAlyngton thought that a universal of the category of substance could\ndirectly receive only the predications of substantial forms more\ncommon than itself. On the other hand, accidental forms inhering in\nsubstantial individuals could be predicated only indirectly\n(essentialiter) of the substantial form itself that those\nindividuals instantiate, predicated indirectly through and in virtue\nof the individuals of that substantial form. So his description of the\nlogical structure of the relationship between universals and\nindividuals demanded a redefinition of predication. Alyngton was\nprobably the first to ameliorate Wyclif\u2019s theory of predication\nby dividing predication into formal predication (praedicatio\nformalis) and remote inherence (inhaerentia remota) or\npredication by essence (praedicatio secundum essentiam).\nRemote inherence is grounded in a partial identity between subject and\npredicate, which share some but not all metaphysical constituents, and\ndoes not demand that the form signified by the predicate term be\ndirectly present in the entity signified by the subject term. On the\nother hand, such a direct presence is needed by formal predication.\n\u201cMan is an animal\u201d and \u201cSocrates is white\u201d are\ninstances of formal predication; \u201c(What is) singular is (what\nis) common\u201d (singulare est commune) and \u201cHumanity\nis running\u201d (humanitas est currens) are instances of\nremote inherence, as according to Alyngton it is possible to attribute\nthe property of being running to the form of humanity if at least one\nman is running. However, he makes sure to use as a predicate term a\nsubstantival adjective in its neuter form, because only in this way\ncan it be made apparent that the form signified by the predicate term\nis not directly present in the subject, but is indirectly attributed\nto it, through its individuals (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, pp. 288\u201390).\n4. The Theory of Substance\n\nThese remarks on the relations between forms and substances bring us\nto the core of Alyngton\u2019s ontology: the doctrine of substance,\ndeveloped in the fifth chapter of his commentary on the\nCategories. Alyngton\u2019s treatment can be divided into\ntwo main parts. (i) The first attempts to clarify what characterizes\nsubstance, and therefore what falls by itself into that category; (ii)\nthe second is concerned with the distinction between primary (or\nindividual) and secondary (or universal) substances.\n\nAlyngton lists seven opinions about the nature and mode of being of\nsubstance, the last of which he supports.\n\nAccording to the first one, proper to grammarians, substance is\nwhat the term \u2018substance\u2019 refers to when utilized in a\nbroad sense, that is, the quiddity (quidditas) or essence\n(essentia) of anything. In this case, substance is not a\ncategory, since the items which fulfil this description do not share\nany common nature (In Cat., cap. de substantia, p.\n263).\nThe second opinion is that of Avicenna, who affirms that any\nentity which does not inhere in something else is a substance (cf.\nLiber de philosophia prima, tr. 8, cap. 4, S. Van Riet ed., 2\nvols., Louvain-Leiden: Peeters-Brill, 1977\u201380, vol. 2, pp.\n403\u2013404). According to this view, God, substantial differences,\nand negative truths can be said to be substances, even though only in\nan analogical way (In Cat., cap. de substantia, pp.\n263\u2013264).\nA third meaning of the term \u2018substance\u2019 can be drawn\nfrom the use (of that term) proper to common people and theologians:\neverything which plays the role of foundation (fundamentum)\nin relation to something else is a substance. In this sense, the\nsurface is the foundation (and therefore the substance) of the\nwhiteness (In Cat., cap. de substantia, p.\n264).\nThe fourth opinion seems to be the same as the anonymous one\ndiscussed and partially criticized by Burley in his last commentary on\nthe Categories (C.E. 1337, cap. de substantia, ed.\nVenetiis 1509, fol. 22rb\u2013va). Substance would be (i) a positive\nbeing, which (ii) does not inhere in something else, and (iii) is\nnaturally apt to play the role of subject in relation to absolute\naccidents (that is, quantities and qualities). According to this view,\nmatter, form, the composite made up of matter and form, and the\nangelic intelligences are substances, whereas substantial differences\nand negative truths are not, since the former do not satisfy the third\nrequisite, nor the latter the first one (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, p. 264).\nThe fifth opinion is that of Boethius (cf. In Categorias\nAristotelis libri quattuor, PL, vol. 64, 184A\u2013B), according\nto whom substance is (i) a positive being, which (ii) does not inhere\nin something else, and (iii) is a compound of matter and form (In\nCat., cap. de substantia, p. 264).\nThe sixth opinion is that of Burley (cf. Expositio super\nPraedicamenta Aristotelis, cap. de substantia, fol.\n24ra.), to whom Alyngton refers by the expression \u2018moderni\nlogici\u2019. According to Burley, (i) not being in a subject,\n(ii) having an essence, (iii) autonomy and independent existence, and\n(iv) the capacity of underlying accidental forms are the main aspect\nof substances. This means that primary substances alone are substances\nproperly speaking, while matter and form, and substantial differences\nare not (In Cat., cap. de substantia, p. 265).\nThe last opinion is that of Wyclif (cf. De ente\npraedicamentali, cap. 5, pp. 36\u201339), quoted extensively and\nalmost verbatim. Alyngton claims that it is superior to the preceding\nones (septima est expositio metaphysica et altior ad intelligendum\nquam praenominatae). According to this view, the constitutive\nprinciple of the substance is not the capacity of underlying absolute\naccidents, but it is the capacity of underlying potency and act, which\nare its inner foundations\u2014the capacity of underlying accidents\nbeing only a derivative property (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, p. 267).\n\n\nWyclif\u2019s position about the nature of substance implies that the\ndistinction between potency and act is, from the point of view of\nmetaphysics, the most fundamental distinction, of which that between\nform and matter is but one example. As (i) prime matter is pure\npotentiality, while form is act, and (ii) the distinction between\npotency and act is wider than that between matter and form, the latter\nis a particular case of the former. In fact, according to Wyclif, the\ndistinction between potency and act runs though the whole of creation,\nsince it applies also to any kinds of spiritual creatures, whereas the\ndistinction between matter and form is found only in the corporeal\ncreatures. On the contrary, Alyngton seems to interpret the\ndistinction between potency and act as a particular case of the\ndistinction between matter and form, since he constantly explains the\nmeaning of the opposition potency-act in terms of the opposition\nbetween matter and form in a crucial passage that he quotes from\nWyclif\u2019s De ente praedicamentali (In Cat.,\ncap. de substantia, p. 267 [= Wyclif, De ente\npraedicamentali, cap. 5, pp. 38\u201339]). The result is a sort\nof universal hylemorphism, since in this way matter and form serve as\nprinciples in the order of being as well as in the order of becoming.\nAll the more so because Alyngton seems to accept the thesis that\n(angelic) intelligences are not pure forms existing by themselves, but\nformal principles necessarily joined to the matter of the heavens in\nsuch a way as to make up living beings (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, p. 264).\n\nA second consequence of this approach to the problem of the nature of\nsubstance is that, within his system, primary substances alone are\nsubstances properly speaking. This conclusion is confirmed by his\nanalysis of the distinctive mark (proprium) of substance:\nwhile remaining numerically one and the same, being capable of\nadmitting contrary properties, the modification taking place through a\nchange in the subject itself of the motion at issue. Alyngton appears\nto think that this description is satisfied only by primary (that is,\nindividual) substances (In Cat., cap. de substantia,\nfol. 104v). Secondary substances therefore are per se in the\ncategory of substance only insofar as they are constitutive parts of\nprimary substances. Thus, secondary substances belong to the category\nof substance by virtue of the individual substances that instantiate\nthem, since they are not formally substances. In fact, unlike primary\nsubstances, secondary substances are forms, and consequently\nincomplete entities with an imperfect and dependent mode of existence.\nThey require composite substances in order to properly exist. No form\nas such, not even the substantial ones, is formally a substance, since\nno form as such has (i) the capacity of underlying potency and act,\nand (ii) matter and form as its inner constituent. Secondary\nsubstances are related to primary substances as formal principles of\nthe latter. It is in this way that humanity and (say) Socrates are\nlinked together. For this reason no secondary substances as such are\ntotally identical with primary substances (In Cat., cap.\nde substantia, p. 280; see also pp. 281 and 282\u2013283).\nAs a consequence, while \u2018man is animal\u2019 (\u2018homo\nest animal\u2019) is a sentence to which a formal predication\ncorresponds in the world, a predication by essence matches\n\u2018humanity is animality\u2019 (\u2018humanitas est\nanimalitas\u2019). Any (individual) man is an animal because of\nthe form of humanity present in him qua its essential\nconstituent, albeit the form of humanity as such is not the principle\nof animality. Therefore, humanity is not formally animality nor\nrationality, even though it is animality plus rationality (In\nCat., cap. de substantia, pp. 283\u2013284; see also\ncap. de quantitate, fols. 106v\u2013107r).\n\nPrimary substances are the substrate of existence of any other kinds\nof categorial being, as nothing exists in addition to primary\nsubstances but secondary substances and accidents, which both are\nforms present in individual substances. Like Aristotle\n(Categories 5, 2b5\u20136), Alyngton can therefore affirm\nthat primary substances are the necessary condition of existence for\nany other items of the world: nothing could exist, if primary\nsubstances stopped existing (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, p. 286). This does not mean, however, that it would\nbe possible to find in the world a primary substance (i) that would\nnot belong to a certain species, and (ii) without any accident\ninhering in it. It means that, from the point of view of full\nexistence, accidents and secondary substances always presuppose\nprimary substances, as to be a primary substance is to be an\nautonomous singular existing item (hoc aliquid), whilst (i)\nto be a secondary substance is to be a quale quid, that is,\nan inner and essential determination (or form) of a primary substance,\nand (ii) to be an accident is to be an outer determination or aspect\nof a primary substance (In Cat., cap. de substantia,\nfol. 101v).\n5. The Absolute Accidents\n\nSince Alyngton thinks of primary substances as the ultimate substrates\nof existence in relation to anything else, the only way to safeguard\nthe reality of accidents as well as their distinction from substance\nand from each other, while at the same time, to affirm their\ndependence on substance in existence, was to conceive of them as forms\nof the substance itself, and therefore as something existentially\nincomplete. Accordingly, like Wyclif, he insists that quantity,\nquality, and relations, considered as abstract accidents, are forms\ninherent in primary substances, whereas, if considered from the point\nof view of their actual existence as concrete items, they are not\nreally distinct from the substance in which they are present, but only\nformally, as they are modes of substances. So, the chief features of\nAlyngton\u2019s treatment of accidents are his twofold consideration\nof them as abstract forms and as concrete properties as well as his\ncommitment to their objective reality, since, in his opinion, they are\nmind-independent items of the world in both cases. Hence, the main\ngoals of his reading of the chapters 6\u20138 of the Aristotelian\ntreatise are showing the ordered internal structure of the chief\ncategories of accidents, and reasserting their reality and real\ndistinction from the category of substance, against those thinkers,\nlike Ockham and his followers, who had attempted to reduce quantity\nand relations to mere aspects of material substances.\n\n1. (Quantity) According to the standard realist\ninterpretation of the Aristotelian doctrine of the categories,\nfollowed also by Alyngton among the nine genera of accidents, quantity\nis the most important one, as it is the basis of all further\naccidents, since quantity orders material substances for receiving\nquality and the other accidental forms (In Cat., cap. de\nquantitate, fol. 106r). On the contrary, Ockham had claimed that\nit was superfluous to posit quantitative forms really distinct from\nsubstance and quality, since quantity presupposes what it is intended\nto explain, that is, the extension of material substances and their\nhaving parts outside parts. As an accident, quantity needs substance\nas its substrate of inherence (cf. Ockham, Expositio in librum\nPraedicamentorum Aristotelis, cap. 10.4, in Opera\nphilosophica, vol. 2, pp. 205\u201324). Like Burley and Wyclif,\nAlyngton denies that material substance can be actually extended\nwithout the presence of the general form of quantity in it, thereby\naffirming its necessity. Hence, he tries to confute Ockham\u2019s\nargumentation. He thinks that the existence of quantity always implies\nthat of substance, but he also believes that the actual existence of\nparts in a substance necessarily implies the presence of a general\nform of quantity in it, really distinct from the substance (say\nSocrates) in which it inheres, and formally distinct from the fact,\ngrounded on the substance at issue, that this same substance is a\nquantified thing. For Alyngton, what characterizes quantity and\ndifferentiates it from the other accidental forms, and in particular\nfrom quality, are the following features: (1) being the appropriate\nmeasure of anything, and (2) being an absolute entity which makes it\npossible that material substances actually have parts outside parts\n(In Cat., cap. de quantitate, fols. 106v, 107r,\n114v).\n\nIf the highest genus of the category of quantity is a form, the seven\nspecies Aristotle enumerates (line, surface, solid, time, place,\nnumber, and speech) clearly are not. Alyngton tries to meet this\ndifficulty by reformulating the notion of quantified-thing\n(quantum), and by proposing a method for deducing the seven\nspecies of quantity from the highest genus (a sort of sufficientia\nquantitatum). He considers the seven species Aristotle lists not\nas quantitative forms, but as the most proper and primary bearers of\nthe quantitative nature, revealed by the highest genus of the\ncategory. In fact, encouraged by the Aristotelian distinction between\nstrict and derivative quantities (Categories 6,\n5a38\u2013b10), like Burley, he distinguishes two different ways of\nbeing quantified: by itself and accidentally (per accidens).\nOnly the seven species of quantity would be quanta by\nthemselves, while any other quantum would be such per\naccidens, and so indirectly, because of its connection to one (or\nmore) of the seven quanta per se (In Cat., cap.\nde quantitate, fol. 116r).\n\nIn Alyngton\u2019s view, the seven species of quantity correspond to\nthe seven possible ways of measuring the being (esse) of the\nmaterial substance. In fact, substance has two main kinds of being:\npermanent and in succession. And both of them can be either discrete\nor continuous. In turn, the being permanent and continuous of material\nsubstance can be measured either from inside or from outside. If from\ninside, then in three different modes: according to one, two or all\nthe three dimensions proper to material substances. In the first case,\nthe measure is line, in the second surface, and in the third solid. If\nit is measured from outside, then it is place. The being of material\nsubstance which is permanent and discrete is measured by numbers. The\nbeing which is in succession and continuous is measured by time. And\nfinally, the being of substance which is in succession and discrete is\nmeasured by the quantity called \u2018speech\u2019 (oratio)\n(In Cat., cap. de quantitate, fol.\n107r\u2013v).\n\nAlyngton\u2019s derivation of the seven species of quantity from a\nunique principle common to them is unconvincing, but extremely\ninteresting, nonetheless, as it clearly shows that he wants to stress\nthe unity of the category of quantity, which at first appears\nheterogeneous, and to trace the problem of reality and real\ndistinction of quantities back to that of the nature and status of its\ndistinctive mark.\n\n2. (Quality) The chapter on quality is the least complex and\ninteresting part of the whole commentary, since Alyngton is faithful\nto Aristotle\u2019s text and doctrine, and sometimes even offers\nrather unproblematic analyses and elucidations. The main general topic\nhe deals with is the internal structure of the category.\n\nIn the first lines of the eighth chapter of the Categories\n(8a25\u201326) Aristotle observes that quality is among those things\nthat are spoken of in a number of ways\u2014an affirmation which\nseems to imply that quality is not a highest genus, as, according to\nAristotle himself, what is spoken of in a number of ways always\ngathers in several different natures. Furthermore, the Stagirite\nspeaks of four species of quality (habits and dispositions, natural\ncapacities and incapacities, affective qualities and affections,\nfigures and shapes), without explaining how they are related to one\nanother and to the highest genus of the category. No Aristotelian\ncommentator had ever thought that quality was spoken of in many ways\npurely equivocally. Therefore no Aristotelian commentator had ever\npresumed that the term \u2018quality\u2019 could have several\ndifferent (but connected) meanings. On the contrary, they unanimously\ntook for granted that it had a unique ratio, common to all\nthe items belonging to the category. They disagreed, however, about\nthe status and hierarchical order of the four species mentioned by\nAristotle. For example, Albert the Great held that quality at once and\ndirectly splits up into the four species, which would all be equally\nfar from the highest genus. Duns Scotus, Ockham, and Walter Burley\nmaintained that the so called \u2018species\u2019 of the quality\nwere not properly species (or intermediate genera), but modes of\nquality, since many singular qualities would belong to the first three\nspecies at the same time, as, unlike species, modes are not\nconstituted by opposite properties. Alyngton rejected both opinions.\nThe latter because it compromises the actual goal of a correct\ncategorial theory, and the former because it does not fit in with the\nstandard infracatagorial structure described by Porphyry in his\nIsagoge. Consequently, he inserts an intermediate level between the\nhighest genus of the category and the four species by claiming that\nquality is first of all divided into perceptible (sensibilis)\nand non-perceptible (insensibilis) qualities. Affective\nqualities and affections, figures and shapes stem from the former kind\nof quality, while habits and dispositions, natural capacities and\nincapacities derive from the latter. In fact, (1) figures and shapes\nare those perceptible qualities which inhere in substances because of\nthe mutual position of its quantitative parts, while affective\nqualities and affections inhere in substances because of the form\nitself of the substantial composite. (2) Natural capacities and\nincapacities are inborn non-perceptible qualities, while habits and\ndispositions are due to the activity, both physical and, if it is the\ncase, intellectual, of the substance in which they inhere (In\nCat., cap. de qualitate, fol. 130r).\n6. Relations and Relatives\n\nAristotle\u2019s treatment of relations and relatives in the\nCategories is opaque and incomplete, since (1) he does not\nhave any notion of relation, as he speaks of relatives and conceives\nof them as those entities to which non-absolute terms of our language\nrefer; (2) he does not discuss the question of the reality of\nrelatives; (3) he does not clarify the connection between the two defi\nnitions of relatives he proposes in the seventh chapters of the\nCategories; (4) he does not give any effective criterion for\ndistinguishing relatives from some items belonging to other categories\n(cf. Ackrill 1963, pp. 98\u2013103). Because of these\nfacts, in the Late Antiquity and in the Middle Ages many authors tried\nto reformulate the doctrine of relatives. The most successful and\ninteresting attempt was that of the Neoplatonic commentators of the\nsixth century, such as Olympiodorus, Philoponus, and Simplicius.\nUnlike Aristotle, they were able to elaborate a notion of relation\n(schesis) almost equivalent to our modern notion of two-place\npredicates, as they conceived of relations as abstract forms whose\ndistinctive feature was the property of being present-in and joining\ntwo different substances at once. This view was rejected by Latin\nmedieval authors. According to Boethius relation (respectus or\nhabitudo) is an accidental form which is in a substance (its substrate\nof inherence) and simply entails a reference to another, without\ninhering in that other. Shortly after the middle of the13th century,\nAlbert the Great explicitly denied that a relation could inhere (in\nthe technical sense of the word) in two substances at once (Liber\nde praedicamentis, tr. 4, cap. 10). Some years later, the same\nthesis was held by Simon of Faversham (Quaestiones in librum\nPraedicamentorum, q. 43). In the 14th century, also Walter Burley\nshared this approach, since it appeared to him to be the only thing\nconsistent with one of the basic principle of medieval metaphysics:\nthe equivalence and correspondence between accidental forms and their\nsubstrates of inherence, so that no accidental form could inhere at\nthe same time and in full in two (or more) substances (cf. Burley,\nExpositio super librum Sex principiorum, cap. de\nhabitu). On the contrary, Wyclif seems to support a different\nopinion, similar to that of the Neoplatonists , as he maintained that\nrelation (1) is different from quality and quantity, since it\npresupposes them, and (2) qua such is a sort of link between two\nthings (cf. Wyclif, De ente praedicamentali,\nch. 7. p. 61).\nAlyngton\u2019s theory of ad aliquid is worthy of note,\nas he possibly was the only late medieval author who followed and\ndeveloped Wyclif \u2019s ideas on that topic.  He conceived of\nrelation (relatio) as an accidental form which is present in\nboth the relatives at once \u2013 even though in different ways,\nsince it names only one of them. Consequently his relation can be\nconsidered as a sort of ontological counterpart of our modern\nfunctions with two variables, or two-place predicates (In\nCat., cap. de relativis, pp. 295\u201396).  According\nto Alyngton, whose account partially differs from that of Wyclif, in\nthe act of relating one substance to another four distinct\nconstitutive elements can be singled out: (1) the relation itself\n\u2013 for instance, the form of paternity; (2) the subject of the\nrelation, that is, the substance that denominatively receives the name\nof the relation \u2013 for instance, the (substance that is the)\nfather; (3) the object of the relation, that is, the substance which\nthe subject of the relation is connected with \u2013 for instance,\nthe (substance that is the) son; and (4) the foundation\n(fundamentum) of the relation, that is, the absolute entity\nin virtue of which the relation inheres in the subject and in the\nobject (ibidem, p. 299). The foundation is the main\ncomponent, since it joins the relation to the underlying substances,\nlets the relation link the substrate to the object, and transmits some\nof its properties to the relation (ibidem, p.  291). Like\nWyclif, Alyngton affirms that only qualities and quantities can be the\nfoundation of a relation (ibidem). Some consequences about\nthe nature and status of relations and relatives derive from these\npremises: (1) relation is a categorial item whose reality is feebler\nthan that of any other accidental form, as it depends upon the\nsimultaneous existence of three different items: the subject, the\nobject, and the foundation (ibidem, p. 295). (2) A relation\ncan start inhering in a substance without any change in the latter,\nbut simply because of a change in another substance. For example:\ngiven two things, one white and the other black, if the black thing\nbecomes white, then, because of this change, a new accident, that is,\na relation of similarity, will inhere also in the fi rst thing, apart\nfrom any other change in it. (3) All the real relatives (relativa\nsecundum esse) are simultaneous by nature, since the real cause of\nbeing a relative is relation, which at the same time inheres in two\nsubstances, thereby making both ones relatives (ibidem,\np. 301). On this basis Alyngton can divide relations into\ntranscendental and categorial relations (ibidem, pp.\n290\u201391), and, what is more, among the latter he can contrast\nreal relatives (relativa secundum esse) with relatives of\nreason (relativa rationis) without utilizing references to\nour mental activities nor to semantic principles. In fact, on the one\nhand, Alyngton describes real relatives as those aggregates (1) made\nup of a primary substance, (2) an absolute accidental form (quantity\nor quality), and (3) a relation which correlates the substance at\nissue to another substance existing in actu. On the other hand, he\ndefi ne relatives of reason as those aggregates characterized by the\noccurrence of at least one of these negative conditions: (1) either\nthe relation\u2019s subject of inherence or its object is not a\nsubstance; (2) the object is not an actual entity; (3) the foundation\nof the relation is not an absolute accident (ibidem, p. 293).\nThe strategy which supports this choice is evident: Alyngton wanted to\nsubstitute references to mental activity with references to the\nexternal world, thus using only objective criteria, based on the\nframework of reality itself in order to classifying things.\n7. The Semantics of Second Intentions\n\nNot until the end of the fourteenth century did anyone claim\nextramental reality for second intentions, not even Walter Burley.\nAccording to him, second intentions are concepts that have a\nfoundation in the extramental world, but are not \u201cthings\u201d\nin the proper sense of the term. This account implied that the\nkeystone of medieval realism, the principle of one-to-one\ncorrespondence between language and the world, has to suffer an\nexception, since no common nature matches second intention terms. It\nwas just in order to do away with this exception that Alyngton (then\nfollowed by William Penbygull, Roger Whelpdale, and John Tarteys)\nhypostatized second intentions, heavily modifying the standard theory\nof the status of second intentions. In fact, Alyngton not only\nconsiders second intentions as objective, but clearly hypostatizes\nthem, speaking of them in terms of real determinations joined to the\nmodes of being of extramental things and directly inhering in them\n(In Cat., cap. de substantia, pp. 268\u201369). As\na consequence, he conceives of logic as an analysis of the general\nframework of reality, since according to him logic turns on structural\nforms (aimed at building up semantic contents), which are, as forms,\nindependent of both such contents and of the mental acts by which they\nare learned. It is through these forms that the network connecting the\nbasic constituents of the world (individuals and universals,\nsubstances and accidents) is disclosed to us (In Cat., cap.\nde substantia, pp. 278\u201379). The strategy that supports\nthis choice is evident: as in the case of relations of reason,\nAlyngton is trying to substitute references to external reality for\nreferences to mental activity. In other words, he seeks to reduce\nepistemology to ontology. From a logical point of view, this means\nthat the same interpretative pattern is employed in order to account\nfor both the semantic power of proper names and common terms (that is,\nthose expressions that refer to a class of individuals), and first and\nsecond intentions. Like proper names, common terms also primarily\nsignify and label a unique object\u2014that is, a common nature. But\nunlike the object signified by a proper name, the reality of the\ncommon nature is distributed among many individuals as their main\nmetaphysical constituent, since it determines the typical features of\nthe individuals themselves. By associating common terms with such\nobjects as their main referent, Alyngton thinks he can explain the\nfact that a common term can stand for and label many individuals at\nonce. Only in this way does he believe we can grant the value of our\nknowledge, which otherwise lacks an adequate foundation (In\nCat., cap. de substantia, fols. 101v\u2013102v).\n\nStill, this procedure, so strong and powerful, leads to a paradox when\napplied to terms of second intention by which we speak of singular\nobjects considered as such\u2014that is, terms (or expressions) like\n\u2018first substance\u2019 (substantia prima),\n\u2018individual\u2019 (individuum), and so on. In fact,\naccording to Alyngton (and many other Realists of that period), a\ncommon term is always matched by a common nature really existing in\nthe world. Therefore, as the term \u2018individual\u2019 appears to\nbe common, since it can stand for a multiplicity of things, it should\nsignify an extramental common nature shared by them. As a consequence,\nwe would have to admit the existence of an individual common\nnature, that is a (self-contradictory) entity present in all the\nindividuals as the cause of their being individuals. Alyngton, who\nwould not give up the principle of the one-to-one relation between\nphilosophical language and the world, could remove this paradox only\nby classifying this kind of term among atomic (discreti)\nterms\u2014that is, terms or nominal syntagms, like\n\u2018Socrates\u2019 or \u2018this man\u2019 (hic homo),\nthat refer to individuals and not to sets of individuals. According to\nAlyngton, there are three main kinds of atomic terms:\n\npersonal pronouns, which identify a singular definite referent by\nmeans of an ostensive definition (a demonstratione);\nproper names; and\nrange-narrowed expressions (a limitatione\nintellectus)\u2014that is, expressions, like \u2018this\nman\u2019, that identify a singular referent as a member of a given\n(manifested) set of individuals. Also expressions like \u2018first\nsubstance\u2019 and \u2018individual\u2019 belong to this third\ntype, since they presuppose a general concept (substance and being, in\nthe example), the range of which is narrowed to a unique object among\nsubstances and beings by an act of our intellect\u2014to one object\nthat is not common (In Cat., cap. de substantia, pp.\n270\u201371).\n\n\nThe rule that terms can be listed as common ones if and only if they\nsignify a common nature is safe, but at the cost of a counterintuitive\ncategorization of their semantic power. In fact, according to\nAlyngton\u2019s account, saying that Socrates and Plato are first\nsubstances simply means that (i) each one is what he is, and that (ii)\nwhat each one is is a non-universal substance. This is a solution that\nentails that to be an individual is not a positive state of affairs,\nbut a negative one, and therefore connects Alyngton\u2019s ontology\nwith Henry of Ghent\u2019s theory of individuation.\n8. Alyngton in the History of Medieval Thought\n\nAlyngton\u2019s theory of categories is an interesting example of\nthat partial dissolution of the traditional doctrine which took place\nin between the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th\ncenturies. Within Alyngton\u2019s metaphysics, (1) the relationships\nbetween primary (or individual) substances and secondary (or\nuniversal) substances, and (2) between substances and accidents (both\nabstract and concrete) as well as (3) the inner natures of essential\nand accidental predications are so different from their Aristotelian\noriginals that the general meaning of the categorial doctrine is\ndeeply modified. According to Alyngton, the formal-and-essential\npredication and the formal-and-accidental predication would correspond\nto Aristotle\u2019s essential and accidental predications\nrespectively. But he regards remote inherence as more general than\nformal predication. Therefore, in his system formal predication is a\nsort of sub-type of the remote inherence. This means that he\nrecognises a single ontological pattern, founded on a partial\nidentity, as the basis of every kind of predicative relation. Thus,\nthe praedicatio formalis essentialis and the praedicatio\nformalis accidentalis are very different from their Aristotelian\nmodels, as they express degrees in identity as well as the remote\ninherence. As a consequence, the relationships between substance and\naccidents and between individuals and universals (and hence the\nontological status of universal substances and that of accidents) are\ncompletely changed. In Alyngton\u2019s view, both concrete accidents,\nqua modes of individual substances, and universal substances, qua the\nmain components of the natures of individual substances, are really\nidentical-to and formally distinct-from primary substances. Moreover,\nin the Categories Aristotle (1) characterizes primary\nsubstances as those beings which are neither present in a subject nor\npredicable of a subject, and (2) considers the capacity of underlying\naccidents as the constitutive principle of substance, while Alyngton\n(1) defi nes primary substance as what (i) is apt to underlie potency\nand act, and (ii) has matter and form as its inner foundations, and\n(2) explicitly affi rms that underlying accidents is only a derivative\nproperty of substance. Finally, because of his strong propensity\ntowards hypostatization (as we have seen, Alyngton methodically\nreplaces logical and epistemological rules with ontological criteria\nand references), he interprets Aristotle\u2019s theory of homonymy,\nsynonymy, and paronymy as an ontological theory about real items and\nnot as a semantic one about the relations between terms and things. In\nconclusion, Alyngton conflates the real and logical (so to say) levels\ninto one: just like Burley and Wyclif , he considers logic as the\ntheory of the discourse on being, turning on structural forms and\nrelations, which exist in the world and are totally independent of the\nmental acts by which they are grasped. It is through these structural\nforms and relations that the network connecting the basic items of\nreality (individuals and universals, substances and accidents) is\nclearly disclosed. Yet, because of his peculiar ideas on substance and\npredication, his world is different from those of Burley and of\nWyclif. On Burley \u2019s view, macro-objects (i.e., what is\nsignified by a proper name or by an individual expression, such as\n\u2018Socrates \u2019 or \u2018this particular horse\u2019) are\nthe basic components of the world. They are aggregates made up of\nreally different items: primary substances and substantial and\naccidental forms existing in them. Primary substances and substantial\nand accidental forms are like simple (or atomic) objects, each\npossessing a unique, well-defi ned nature. Although they are simple,\nsome of these components are in a sense composite because they are\nreducible to something else \u2013 for example, primary substance is\ncomposed of a particular form and matter. Primary substance differs\nfrom the other components of a macro-object because of its peculiar\nmode of being as an autonomous and independently existing object, in\ncontrast with the other categorial items, which necessarily presuppose\nit for their existence. Primary substances are therefore substrates of\nexistence in relation to everything else. The distinction between\nsubstantial and accidental forms derives from their different\nrelations to primary substances: substantial, universal forms disclose\nthe natures of primary substances; by contrast, those forms that\nsimply affect primary substances without being actually joined to\ntheir natures are accidental forms. As a result, the macro-object is\nnot simply a primary substance but an orderly collection of categorial\nitems, so that primary substance, even though it is the most important\nelement, does not contain the whole being of the macro-object. On\nWyclif \u2019s view, whatever is is a proposition\n(pan-propositionalism). The constitutive property of any kind of being\nis the capacity of being the object of a complex act of signifying.\nThis choice implies a revolution in the standard medieval theory of\ntranscendentals, since Wyclif actually replaces being with true.\nAccording to the common belief, verum was nothing but being\nitself considered in relation to an intellect, no matter whether\ndivine or human. According to Wyclif, being is no more the main\ntranscendental and its notion is not the first and simplest, but there\nis something more basic to which being can be brought back: the truth\n(veritas) (or true, verum). Only what can be signifi\ned by a complex expression is a being, and whatever is the proper\nobject of an act of signifying is a truth. \u2018Truth\u2019 is\ntherefore the true name of being itself. From the ontological point of\nview this entails the uniqueness in type of the significata\nof every class of categorematic expressions. Within Wyclif \u2019s\nworld it is the same (kind of ) object which both concrete terms and\npropositions refer to, as primary substances have to be regarded as\n(atomic) states of affairs. According to him, from the metaphysical\npoint of view a singular man, for instance, is nothing but a real\nproposition, with its real suject (the concrete existence in time of\nthat singular thing, say Socrates), its real predicate (the common\nnature, i.e., the human nature viewed qua universal), and its copula\n(the singular essence, i. e., the individual essence of Socrates). The\nresult is that Wyclif \u2019s world consists of molecular objects,\nwhich are not simple, but composite, because they are reducible to\nsomething else, belonging to a different rank of reality, and unable\nto exist by itself: being and essence, potency and act, matter and\nform, abstract genera, species and differences. For that reason,\neverything one can speak about or think of is both a thing (or\nmolecular object) and a sort of atomic state of affairs, while every\ntrue proposition expresses either an atomic or a molecular state of\naffairs, that is the union (if the proposition is affirmative) or the\nseparation (if the proposition is negative) of two (or more) molecular\nobjects. On the contrary, Alyngton\u2019s world consists of atomic\nobjects whose constitutive elements are abstract forms (or essences),\nboth substantial and accidental, potency and act, and matter. In fact,\naccording to him, unlike Burley, what is signified by a proper name or\nby an individual expression is a primary substance, and, unlike\nWyclif, simple and complex expressions have different\nsignificata. Moreover, in his view, Socrates cannot be\nregarded as an aggregate, since the beings of the substantial\nuniversal forms predicated of him and those of the concrete accidental\nforms inhering in him coincide with the being of that primary\nsubstance Socrates himself is. Thus, if we consider Socrates from the\npoint of view of his being, Socrates is simply an atomic object, a\nprimary substance. If we consider him from the point of view of the\nessences that he contains in himself, then he is a compound of really\ndifferent forms, which can exist only in it, as its components, and\nthrough its being. This is the inner sense (1) of the formula\n\u2018really identical and formally distinct\u2019 that Alyngton\nemploys for explaining the relation between universals and individuals\nas well as the relation between substance and concrete accidents; and\n(2) of his description of the nature and peculiar mode of being of the\nprimary substance: to be a primary substance is to be the\nbeing of whatever can be.\n",
