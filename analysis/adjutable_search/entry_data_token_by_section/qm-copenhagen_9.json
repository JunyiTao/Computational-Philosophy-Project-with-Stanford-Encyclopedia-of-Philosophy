    "main_text": "The Measurement Problem and the Classical-Quantum Distinction\n10. New Perspectives\n\nAfter the 1950s a number of alternative interpretations to\nBohr\u2019s complementarity were articulated and they all found their\nproponents among physicists and philosophers of science. The\nCopenhagen interpretation started to lose ground to other\ninterpretations such as Bohm\u2019s interpretation, the many worlds\ninterpretation, the modal interpretation and the decoherence\ninterpretation, which have been more in vogue the last couple of\ndecades. But parallel with the growing awareness of the essential\ndifferences between Bohr\u2019s and Heisenberg\u2019s understanding\nof quantum mechanics several philosophers of science have revitalised\nBohr\u2019s view on complementarity. Around the millennium a new\nrecognition of the Copenhagen interpretation has emerged.\n\nRob Clifton and Hans Halvorson (1999, 2002) argue that Bohm\u2019s\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics can be seen as a special case of\nBohr\u2019s complementarity interpretation if it is assumed that all\nmeasurements ultimately reduce to positions measurement. Originally\nJeffrey Bub and Clifton (1996) were able to demonstrate (given some\nidealized conditions) that Bohr\u2019s complementarity and\nBohm\u2019s mechanics fall under their uniqueness theorem for\nno-collapse interpretations. Clifton and Halvorson improve this result\nby showing that Bohr\u2019s idea of position and momentum\ncomplementarity can be expressed in terms of inequivalent\nrepresentations in the C*-algebraic formalism of quantum mechanics. It\nturns out that either position or momentum are dynamically\nsignificant, but it is not permissible to assume that position and\nmomentum are both dynamically significant in any single context. From\nthese assumptions they conclude that Bohm\u2019s hidden variables are\nnone other than the \u201cvalue states\u201d that the\ncomplementarity interpretation postulates if position measurement were\nalways dynamically significant, but this metaphysical restriction is\nnot, as their results indicate, demanded by the physics. Rather,\nClifton and Halvorson (1999) and Halvorson (2004) believe that\ncomplementarity may give us a realist interpretation of quantum field\ntheory.\n\nPhilosophers have also started to explore the idea of decoherence in\nrelation to Bohr\u2019s view about \u201cthe inseparability of the\nbehavior of the object and the interaction with the measuring\ninstrument\u201d or \u201cthe uncontrollable interaction between the\natomic system and measurement apparatus.\u201d (Schlosshauer and\nCamilleri 2011, 2017; Camilleri and Schlosshauer 2015; B\u00e4chtold\n2017; and Tanona 2017). Although Bohr assumed that the measuring\napparatus is altogether a quantum mechanical system, he nevertheless\nbelieved that the instrument could be approximately described by\nclassical theory. Among the scholars just mentioned there is\na general agreement that the notion of decoherent is coherent with\nBohr\u2019s view about the quantum-classical division and adds a\ndynamical explanation of quantum-to-classical transition which\nBohr\u2019s own exposition lacked. Also attempts to clear up the\nstructural relationship between Bohr\u2019s view and Hugh\nEverett\u2019s \u201crelative state\u201d-interpretation have been\ncarried out; a relationship which at some points is much closer than\nusually thought (Bacciagaluppi 2017).\n\nAnother insight into Bohr\u2019s view of complementarity is due to\nMichael Dickson (2001, 2002). By using the contemporary theory of\nreference frames in quantum theory, he proves that Bohr\u2019s\nresponse to the EPR thought-experiment was in fact the correct one.\nMoreover, he also maintains that Bohr\u2019s discussions of spin, a\nproperty much less frame dependent than position and momentum, were\nvery different from his discussions of the latter, and based on these\ndifferences he offers a Bohrian account of Bell\u2019s theorem and\nits significance.\n\nA re-assessment of Bohr\u2019s philosophy of quantum mechanics is\nmade by Whitaker (2004) on the basis of Clifton and Halvorson\u2019s\nand Dickson\u2019s works and in the light of quantum information\ntheory. Besides these attempts to apply Bohr\u2019s notion of\ncomplementarity to the contemporary discussions of the interpretation\nof quantum mechanics and quantum field theory there is an ongoing\nattempt to understand Bohr\u2019s idea of symbolic representation\n(Tanona, 2004a, 2004b) and his notion of complementarity with respect\nto trends in post-modern philosophy and general epistemology such as\npoststructuralism, deconstructivism, feminism and cultural studies\n(Honner 1994; Plotnitsky 1994; Barad 2007; and Katsumori 2011).\n",
