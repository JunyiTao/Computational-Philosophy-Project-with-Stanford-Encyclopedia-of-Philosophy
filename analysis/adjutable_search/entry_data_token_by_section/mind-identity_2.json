Phenomenal Properties and Topic-Neutral Analyses\n\n\nSomeone might object that the dean of the medical school does not\nqua dean hiccup in lectures. Qua dean he goes to\nmeetings with the vice-chancellor. This is not to the point but there\nis a point behind it. This is that the property of being the\nprofessor of anatomy is not identical with the property of\nbeing the dean of the medical school. The question might be asked, that\neven if sensations are identical with brain processes, are there not\nintrospected non-physical properties of sensations that are not\nidentical with properties of brain processes? How would a physicalist\nidentity theorist deal with this? The answer (Smart 1959) is that the\nproperties of experiences are \u2018topic neutral\u2019. Smart\nadapted the words \u2018topic-neutral\u2019 from Ryle, who used them\nto characterise words such as \u2018if, \u2018or\u2019,\n\u2018and\u2019, \u2018not\u2019, \u2018because\u2019. If you\noverheard only these words in a conversation you would not be able to\ntell whether the conversation was one of mathematics, physics, geology,\nhistory, theology, or any other subject. Smart used the words\n\u2018topic neutral\u2019 in the narrower sense of being neutral\nbetween physicalism and dualism. For example \u2018going on\u2019,\n\u2018occurring\u2019, \u2018intermittent\u2019,\n\u2018waxing\u2019, \u2018waning\u2019 are topic neutral. So is\n\u2018me\u2019 in so far as it refers to the utterer of the sentence\nin question. Thus to say that a sensation is caused by lightning or the\npresence of a cabbage before my eyes leaves it open as to whether the\nsensation is non-physical as the dualist believes or is physical as the\nmaterialist believes. This sentence also is neutral as to whether the\nproperties of the sensation are physical or whether some of them are\nirreducibly psychical. To see how this idea can be applied to the\npresent purpose let us consider the following example. \n\n\nSuppose that I have a yellow, green and purple striped mental image.\nWe may also introduce the philosophical term \u2018sense datum\u2019\nto cover the case of seeing or seeming to see something yellow, green\nand purple: we say that we have a yellow, green and purple sense datum.\nThat is I would see or seem to see, for example, a flag or an array of\nlamps which is green, yellow and purple striped. Suppose also, as seems\nplausible, that there is nothing yellow, green and purple striped in\nthe brain. Thus it is important for identity theorists to say (as\nindeed they have done) that sense data and images are not part of the\nfurniture of the world. \u2018I have a green sense datum\u2019 is\nreally just a way of saying that I see or seem to see something that\nreally is green. This move should not be seen as merely an ad\nhoc device, since Ryle and J.L. Austin, in effect Wittgenstein,\nand others had provided arguments, as when Ryle argued that mental\nimages were not a sort of ghostly picture postcard. Place characterised\nthe fallacy of thinking that when we perceive something green we are\nperceiving something green in the mind as \u2018the phenomenological\nfallacy\u2019. He characterizes this fallacy (Place 1956):\nthe mistake of supposing that when the subject describes\nhis experience, when he describes how things look, sound, smell, taste,\nor feel to him, he is describing the literal properties of objects and\nevents on a peculiar sort of internal cinema or television screen,\nusually referred to in the modern psychological literature as the\n\u2018phenomenal field\u2019.\n\n\nOf course, as Smart recognised, this leaves the identity theory\ndependent on a physicalist account of colour . His early account of\ncolour (1961) was too behaviourist, and could not deal, for example,\nwith the reversed spectrum problem, but he later gave a realist and\nobjectivist account (Smart 1975). Armstrong had been realist about\ncolour but Smart worried that if so colour would be a very\nidiosyncratic and disjunctive concept, of no cosmic importance, of no\ninterest to extraterrestrials (for instance) who had different visual\nsystems. Prompted by Lewis in conversation Smart came to realize that\nthis was no objection to colours being objective properties. \n\n\nOne first gives the notion of a normal human percipient with respect\nto colour for which there are objective tests in terms of ability to\nmake discriminations with respect to colour. This can be done without\ncircularity. Thus \u2018discriminate with respect to colour\u2019 is\na more primitive notion than is that of colour. (Compare the way that\nin set theory \u2018equinumerous\u2019 is antecedent to\n\u2018number\u2019.) Then Smart elucidated the notion of colour in\nterms of the discriminations with respect to colour of normal human\npercipients in normal conditions (say cloudy Scottish daylight). This\naccount of colour may be disjunctive and idiosyncratic. (Maxwell's\nequations might be of interest to Alpha Centaurians but hardly our\ncolour concepts.) Anthropocentric and disjunctive they may be, but\nobjective none the less. David R. Hilbert (1987) identifies colours\nwith reflectances, thus reducing the idiosyncrasy and disjunctiveness.\nA few epicycles are easily added to deal with radiated light, the\ncolours of rainbows or the sun at sunset and the colours due to\ndiffraction from feathers. John Locke was on the right track in making\nthe secondary qualities objective as powers in the object, but erred in\nmaking these powers to be powers to produce ideas in the mind rather\nthan to make behavioural discriminations. (Also Smart would say that if\npowers are dispositions we should treat the secondary qualities as the\ncategorical bases of these powers, e.g. in the case of colours\nproperties of the surfaces of objects.) Locke's view suggested that the\nideas have mysterious qualia observed on the screen of an internal\nmental theatre. However to do Locke justice he does not talk in effect\nof \u2018red ideas\u2019 but of \u2018ideas of red\u2019.\nPhilosophers who elucidate \u2018is red\u2019 in terms of\n\u2018looks red\u2019 have the matter the wrong way round (Smart\n1995).\n\n\nLet us return to the issue of us having a yellow, purple and green\nstriped sense datum or mental image and yet there being no yellow,\npurple and green striped thing in the brain. The identity theorist\n(Smart 1959) can say that sense data and images are not real things in\nthe world: they are like the average plumber. Sentences ostensibly\nabout the average plumber can be translated into, or elucidated in\nterms of, sentences about plumbers. So also there is having a green\nsense datum or image but not sense data or images, and the having of a\ngreen sense datum or image is not itself green. So it can, so far as\nthis goes, easily be a brain process which is not green either.\n\n\nThus Place (1956, p. 49):\nWhen we describe the after-image as green... we are saying\nthat we are having the sort of experience which we normally have when,\nand which we have learned to described as, looking at a green patch of\nlight.\n\n\nand Smart (1959) says:\nWhen a person says \u2018I see a yellowish-orange\nafter-image\u2019 he is saying something like this: \"There is\nsomething going on which is like what is going on when I have my\neyes open, am awake, and there is an orange illuminated in good light\nin front of me\".\n\n\nQuoting these passages, David Chalmers (1996, p. 360) objects that\nif \u2018something is going on\u2019 is construed broadly enough it\nis inadequate, and if it is construed narrowly enough to cover only\nexperiential states (or processes) it is not sufficient for the\nconclusion. Smart would counter this by stressing the word\n\u2018typically\u2019. Of course a lot of things go on in me when I\nhave a yellow after image (for example my heart is pumping blood\nthrough my brain). However they do not typically go on then:\nthey go on at other times too. Against Place Chalmers says that the\nword \u2018experience\u2019 is unanalysed and so Place's analysis is\ninsufficient towards establishing an identity between sensations and\nbrain processes. As against Smart he says that leaving the word\n\u2018experience\u2019 out of the analysis renders it inadequate.\nThat is, he does not accept the \u2018topic-neutral\u2019 analysis.\nSmart hopes, and Chalmers denies, that the account in terms of\n\u2018typically of\u2019 saves the topic-neutral analysis. In defence\nof Place one might perhaps say that it is not clear that the word\n\u2018experience\u2019 cannot be given a topic neutral analysis,\nperhaps building on Farrell (1950). If we do not need the word\n\u2018experience\u2019 neither do we need the word\n\u2018mental\u2019. Rosenthal (1994) complains (against the identity\ntheorist) that experiences have some characteristically mental\nproperties, and that \u2018We inevitably lose the distinctively mental\nif we construe these properties as neither physical nor mental\u2019.\nOf course to be topic neutral is to be able to be both physical and\nmental, just as arithmetic is. There is no need for the word\n\u2018mental\u2019 itself to occur in the topic neutral formula.\n\u2018Mental\u2019, as Ryle (1949) suggests, in its ordinary use is a\nrather grab-bag term, \u2018mental arithmetic\u2019, \u2018mental\nillness\u2019, etc. with which an identity theorist finds no\ntrouble.\n",
