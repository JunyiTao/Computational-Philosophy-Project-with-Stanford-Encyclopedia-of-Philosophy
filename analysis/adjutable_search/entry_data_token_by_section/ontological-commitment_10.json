    "main_text": "Truthmaker Accounts of Ontological Commitment || Overview\n3.1 Overview\nQuantifier accounts of ontological commitment, we have seen, are\nliable to miss the implicit ontological commitments of\ntheories because they look exclusively to the values of the variables\nof quantification. Entailment accounts succeed in capturing implicit\ncommitments, but are liable to overgenerate if the entailment\nrelation fails to be sensitive to relevant ontological\ndistinctions. According to truthmaker accounts of ontological\ncommitment, being a truthmaker for a theory is just such a\nrelevant ontological distinction: to find the ontological commitments\nof a theory, we should look towards the truthmakers for that theory;\na theory is ontologically committed to Ks only\nif Ks are needed in order to make the theory true. According\nto truthmaker theorists, focusing on truthmakers will eliminate\nspurious ontological commitments of an entailment theory. The problem\nfor a truthmaker account, however, is how to do this without also\neliminating genuine ontological\ncommitments.[28]\nTruthmaker accounts, like entailment accounts, have the feature\nthat ontological commitment depends only on the content of a\ntheory, not on its logical form. That will be so if the\nprimary truthbearers are taken to be non-linguistic propositions\n(individuated by content) rather than sentences. In that case,\nontological commitment applies directly to the propositions, or to\ntheories construed as sets of propositions, and only indirectly to\nthe sentences, or sets of sentences, that express those propositions.\nThat has the benefit, as with the entailment account, of freeing the\nnotion of ontological commitment from language (see\n\u00a72.1).  But taking propositions to be truthbearers will not\nbe to every truthmaker theorist's liking. Moreover, different views\non the nature of propositions\u2014possible worlds accounts,\nRussellian accounts, Fregean accounts, to name a few\u2014lead to\nsomewhat different truthmaker accounts. To remain neutral in what\nfollows with respect to the existence and nature of propositions,\nsentences will be taken to be the bearers of truth, and ontological\ncommitment will continue to be applied to theories construed as sets\nof sentences.[29]\nSay that an entity makes true (or is a truthmaker\nfor) a sentence or theory if the existence of that entity is, in\nsome sense, sufficient for the truth of the sentence or\ntheory. (It is left open for now just how to understand this notion of\nsufficiency.) In some cases, truthmakers are easy to come by. For\nexample, the sentence \u2018Socrates exists\u2019 has Socrates as a\ntruthmaker (assuming, at any rate, that Socrates has real\nexistence; see \u00a73.2 below). The\nsentence \u2018Elephants exist\u2019 has multiple truthmakers: each\nand every particular elephant (assuming elephants are necessarily\nelephants; see \u00a73.3 below). Other cases\nare more problematic. Consider the conjunction: \u2018Socrates exists\nand Plato exists\u2019. Neither Socrates nor Plato, by himself, is a\ntruthmaker for the conjunction; we need the pair of Socrates\nand Plato. But how should we understand \u2018pair\u2019 here? There\nare three options. If one is a universalist about mereological\ncomposition\u2014for any things, there is a mereological sum composed\nof just those things\u2014then perhaps the sum of Socrates and Plato\ncan serve as a truthmaker for the conjunction. If one is a realist\nabout sets\u2014and sets exist \u201cin the world\u201d when their\nmembers do\u2014then perhaps the set with Socrates and Plato as its\nmembers can serve as a truthmaker. But if we reject mereological\nuniversalism and set theoretic realism, then we will have to allow\nthat the truthmaker relation takes a plural argument: Socrates and\nPlato together are truthmakers for the conjunction, but there is no\nsingle entity that is a truthmaker. In what follows, it will be\nsimplest to speak as if, whenever a theory has truthmakers, it has a\nsingle entity as a truthmaker; but only minor emendations would be\nneeded to allow for plural truthmaking.\nSome sentences, it is natural to think, have neither singular nor\nplural truthmakers (see Lewis 2001). For example, a negative\nexistential sentence such as \u2018There are no unicorns\u2019 is\nmade true, it seems, not by what exists, but by what fails to exist:\nit is true for lack of any falsemakers. And whether a (contingent)\npredication such as \u2018the ball is red\u201d is made true by the\nball in question will depend on how the notion of sufficiency is\nunderstood (see  Supplement to\n\u00a73.3).  Truthmaker maximalists hold\nthat every truth (or at least every contingent truth) has a\ntruthmaker. Typically, truthmaker maximalists will\nintroduce states of affairs or facts to serve as the\nrequired truthmakers: totality states of affairs can serve as\ntruthmakers for negative existentials (see Armstrong 2004:\n72\u20135); the state of affairs of the ball's being red, not the red\nball itself, is the truthmaker for \u2018the ball is red\u2019 (see\nArmstrong 1997: 115\u20136).  There is a danger here that truthmaking\ncould be trivialized: could any true sentence S be said to\nhave the state of affairs that S as its truthmaker?\nTypically, truthmaker maximalists avoid such trivialization by holding\nto a sparse theory of states of affairs. For example, a disjunctive\nsentence \u2018S or T\u2019 is not made true by a\ndisjunctive state of affairs: there are none. Rather, the truthmakers\nfor S (if any) and the truthmakers for T (if any)\nare separately truthmakers for the disjunction \u2018S\nor T\u2019. In any case, truthmaker maximalism is not\nrequired for the truthmaker approach to ontological commitment. What\nmatters, rather, is that the truthmakers and the ontological\ncommitments of a theory are aligned.\nHow might a truthmaker criterion for ontological commitment be\nformulated? It will be useful to separately consider two versions, one\nfor ontological commitment to particular entities, the other for\nontological commitment to kinds:\n\nTruthmaker Criterion for Particulars: A theory T\nis ontologically committed to a particular a iff,\nnecessarily, if T is true, then a is a truthmaker\nfor T.\nTruthmaker Criterion for Kinds: A theory T\nis ontologically committed to Ks iff, necessarily,\nif T is true, then Ks are among the truthmakers\nfor T.\n\nNote that in the criterion for particulars the necessity is de\nre. The particular a itself must be a truthmaker\nfor T in any world where T is true. But in the\ncriterion for kinds the necessity must be taken to be de\ndicto (with respect to \u2018K\u2019) if the criterion\nis to give the desired results. For example, \u2018there are\nelephants\u2019 is ontologically committed to elephants according to\nthe criterion if some elephant or other is a truthmaker for\n\u2018there are elephants\u2019 in any world in which it is true,\nwhether or not any actual elephant is a truthmaker in those\nworlds.\nHow should we understand the truthmaking relation, and the way in\nwhich the existence of the truthmaker is sufficient for the\ntruth of the theory? On the orthodox necessitation approach to\ntruthmaking (Fox 1987; Bigelow 1988: 125; Armstrong 1997: 115; Lewis\n2001), this sufficiency is analyzed in modal terms as\nfollows: x is a truthmaker for T\niff T is true and, necessarily, if x exists,\nthen T is true. (A plural version replaces the singular\nvariable \u2018x\u2019 with a plural variable\n\u2018xx\u2019 (read \u201cthe xs\u201d).) This\nleads to a familiar problem when truthmakers are sought for necessary\ntheories: any entity (or plurality of entities) is a truthmaker for\nany necessary theory on the analysis. And there is the familiar fix:\nreplace modal entailment (in the analysis of truthmaking) with a more\ndiscriminating entailment relation, perhaps some sort of relevant\nentailment (Restall 1996). But for many truthmaker theorists, no\nentailment relation will be able to capture the idea that truthmakers\nmust be fundamental entities, and must ground the\ntheories they make true. This drives these truthmaker theorists to\nintroduce a primitive grounding or in-virtue-of relation to\ncharacterize the truthmaking relation: x is\na truthmaker for T iff T is true and,\nnecessarily, Ts truth is grounded in x\n(or T is true in virtue of the existence\nof x) (see Schaffer 2010 and Cameron forthcoming).  Call\nthis the grounding account of\ntruthmaking.[30]\nAccording to truthmaker necessitarianism, the existence of\nthe truthmaker necessitates the truth of the sentence: any\npossible world in which the truthmaker exists is a world in which the\nsentence is true. Truthmaker necessitarianism is automatic on the\nnecessitation analysis of truthmaking. On a grounding account,\ntruthmaker necessitarianism can be upheld by endorsing an axiomatic\nconstraint on the notion of grounding: if an entity grounds\nthe truth of a sentence, then, necessarily, if the entity exists,\nthen the sentence is true. The problems to be discussed\n(in \u00a73.3\nand \u00a73.4) apply to any truthmaker\naccount of ontological commitment that endorses truthmaker\nnecessitarianism.[31]\n",
