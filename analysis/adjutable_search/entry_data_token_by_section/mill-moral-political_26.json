    "main_text": "Sexual Equality\n5. Sexual Equality\n\nMill applies his liberal principles to issues of sexual equality\nprimarily in The Subjection of Women. He denounces existing\nforms of sexual inequality in clear and unequivocal terms.\n\n\n[T]he principle which regulates the existing social relations between\nthe two sexes\u2014the legal subordination of one sex to the\nother\u2014is wrong in itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to\nhuman improvement; and \u2026 it ought to be replaced by a principle\nof perfect equality, admitting no power or privilege on the one side,\nnor disability on the other. (SW 261)\n\n\nTo modern ears, Mill\u2019s defense of sexual equality may seem\nobvious, and, to some contemporary feminists, Mill\u2019s criticism\nof sexual inequality may not be deep or consistent enough. But, when\nviewed in historical context, Mill\u2019s defense of sexual equality\nis radical, courageous, and sometimes eloquent (Shanley 1998). While\nMill clearly expected some aspects of his liberal principles in On\nLiberty to be controversial (OL I 6\u20138), their\nrevolutionary import became especially clear when he applied them\nto issues of sexual equality in The Subjection of Women\n(Nicholson 1998: 471).\n",
