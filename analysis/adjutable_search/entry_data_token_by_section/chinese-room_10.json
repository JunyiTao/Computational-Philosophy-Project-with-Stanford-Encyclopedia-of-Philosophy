    "main_text": "Replies to the Chinese Room Argument || The Intuition Reply\n4.5 The Intuition Reply\n\nMany responses to the Chinese Room argument have noted that, as with\nLeibniz\u2019 Mill, the argument appears to be based on intuition:\nthe intuition that a computer (or the man in the room) cannot think or\nhave understanding. For example, Ned Block (1980) in his original BBS\ncommentary says \u201cSearle\u2019s argument depends for its force\non intuitions that certain entities do not think.\u201d But, Block\nargues, (1) intuitions sometimes can and should be trumped and (2)\nperhaps we need to bring our concept of understanding in line with a\nreality in which certain computer robots belong to the same natural\nkind as humans. Similarly Margaret Boden (1988) points out that we\ncan\u2019t trust our untutored intuitions about how mind depends on\nmatter; developments in science may change our intuitions. Indeed,\nelimination of bias in our intuitions was precisely what motivated\nTuring (1950) to propose the Turing Test, a test that was blind to the\nphysical character of the system replying to questions. Some of\nSearle\u2019s critics in effect argue that he has merely pushed the\nreliance on intuition back, into the room.\n\nFor example, one can hold that despite Searle\u2019s intuition that\nhe would not understand Chinese while in the room, perhaps he is\nmistaken and does, albeit unconsciously. Hauser (2002) accuses Searle\nof Cartesian bias in his inference from \u201cit seems to me quite\nobvious that I understand nothing\u201d to the conclusion that I\nreally understand nothing. Normally, if one understands English or\nChinese, one knows that one does \u2013 but not necessarily. Searle\nlacks the normal introspective awareness of understanding \u2013 but\nthis, while abnormal, is not conclusive. \n\nCritics of the CRA note that our intuitions about intelligence,\nunderstanding and meaning may all be unreliable. With regard to\nmeaning, Wakefield 2003, following Block 1998, defends what Wakefield\ncalls \u201cthe essentialist objection\u201d to the CRA, namely that\na computational account of meaning is not analysis of ordinary\nconcepts and their related intuitions. Rather we are building a\nscientific theory of meaning that may require revising our intuitions.\nAs a theory, it gets its evidence from its explanatory power, not its\naccord with pre-theoretic intuitions (however Wakefield himself argues\nthat computational accounts of meaning are afflicted by a pernicious\nindeterminacy (pp. 308ff)). \n\nOther critics focusing on the role of intuitions in the CRA argue that\nour intuitions regarding both intelligence and understanding may also\nbe unreliable, and perhaps incompatible even with current science.\nWith regard to understanding, Steven Pinker, in How the Mind\nWorks (1997), holds that \u201c\u2026 Searle is merely\nexploring facts about the English word understand\u2026.\nPeople are reluctant to use the word unless certain stereotypical\nconditions apply\u2026\u201d But, Pinker claims, nothing\nscientifically speaking is at stake. Pinker objects to Searle\u2019s\nappeal to the \u201ccausal powers of the brain\u201d by noting that\nthe apparent locus of the causal powers is the \u201cpatterns of\ninterconnectivity that carry out the right information\nprocessing\u201d. Pinker ends his discussion by citing a science\nfiction story in which Aliens, anatomically quite unlike humans,\ncannot believe that humans think when they discover that our heads are\nfilled with meat. The Aliens\u2019 intuitions are unreliable \u2013\npresumably ours may be so as well.\n\nClearly the CRA turns on what is required to understand language.\nSchank 1978 clarifies his claim about what he thinks his programs can\ndo: \u201cBy \u2018understand\u2019, we mean SAM [one of his\nprograms] can create a linked causal chain of conceptualizations that\nrepresent what took place in each story.\u201d This is a nuanced\nunderstanding of \u201cunderstanding\u201d, whereas the Chinese Room\nthought experiment does not turn on a technical understanding of\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d, but rather intuitions about our ordinary\ncompetence when we understand a word like \u201chamburger\u201d.\nIndeed by 2015 Schank distances himself from weak senses of\n\u201cunderstand\u201d, holding that no computer can\n\u201cunderstand when you tell it something\u201d, and that\nIBM\u2019s WATSON \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what it is saying\u201d.\nSchank\u2019s program may get links right, but arguably does not know\nwhat the linked entities are. Whether it does or not depends on what\nconcepts are, see section 5.1. Furthermore it is possible that when it\ncomes to attributing understanding of language we have different\nstandards for different things \u2013 more relaxed for dogs and\ntoddlers. Some things understand a language \u201cun poco\u201d.\nSearle (1980)concedes that there are degrees of understanding, but\nsays that all that matters that there are clear cases of no\nunderstanding, and AI programs are an example: \u201cThe computer\nunderstanding is not just (like my understanding of German) partial or\nincomplete; it is zero.\u201d \n\nSome defenders of AI are also concerned with how our understanding of\nunderstanding bears on the Chinese Room argument. In their paper\n\u201cA Chinese Room that Understands\u201d AI researchers Simon and\nEisenstadt (2002) argue that whereas Searle refutes \u201clogical\nstrong AI\u201d, the thesis that a program that passes the Turing\nTest will necessarily understand, Searle\u2019s argument\ndoes not impugn \u201cEmpirical Strong AI\u201d \u2013 the thesis\nthat it is possible to program a computer that convincingly satisfies\nordinary criteria of understanding. They hold however that it is\nimpossible to settle these questions \u201cwithout employing a\ndefinition of the term \u2018understand\u2019 that can provide a\ntest for judging whether the hypothesis is true or false\u201d. They\ncite W.V.O. Quine\u2019s Word and Object as showing that\nthere is always empirical uncertainty in attributing understanding to\nhumans. The Chinese Room is a Clever Hans trick (Clever Hans was a\nhorse who appeared to clomp out the answers to simple arithmetic\nquestions, but it was discovered that Hans could detect unconscious\ncues from his trainer). Similarly, the man in the room doesn\u2019t\nunderstand Chinese, and could be exposed by watching him closely.\n(Simon and Eisenstadt do not explain just how this would be done, or\nhow it would affect the argument.) Citing the work of Rudolf Carnap,\nSimon and Eisenstadt argue that to understand is not just to exhibit\ncertain behavior, but to use \u201cintensions\u201d that determine\nextensions, and that one can see in actual programs that they do use\nappropriate intensions. They discuss three actual AI programs, and\ndefend various attributions of mentality to them, including\nunderstanding, and conclude that computers understand; they learn\n\u201cintensions by associating words and other linguistic structure\nwith their denotations, as detected through sensory stimuli\u201d.\nAnd since we can see exactly how the machines work, \u201cit is, in\nfact, easier to establish that a machine exhibits understanding that\nto establish that a human exhibits understanding\u2026.\u201d Thus,\nthey conclude, the evidence for empirical strong AI is\noverwhelming.\n\nSimilarly, Daniel Dennett in his original 1980 response to\nSearle\u2019s argument called it \u201can intuition pump\u201d, a\nterm he came up with in discussing the CRA with Hofstader. Sharvy 1983\nechoes the complaint. Dennett\u2019s considered view (2013) is that\nthe CRA is \u201cclearly a fallacious and misleading argument\n\u2026.\u201d (p. 320). Paul Thagard (2013) proposes that for every\nthought experiment in philosophy there is an equal and opposite\nthought experiment. Thagard holds that intuitions are unreliable, and\nthe CRA is an example (and that in fact the CRA has now been refuted\nby the technology of autonomous robotic cars). Dennett has elaborated\non concerns about our intuitions regarding intelligence. Dennett 1987\n(\u201cFast Thinking\u201d) expressed concerns about the slow speed\nat which the Chinese Room would operate, and he has been joined by\nseveral other commentators, including Tim Maudlin, David Chalmers, and\nSteven Pinker. The operator of the Chinese Room may eventually produce\nappropriate answers to Chinese questions. But slow thinkers are\nstupid, not intelligent \u2013 and in the wild, they may well end up\ndead. Dennett argues that \u201cspeed \u2026 is \u2018of the\nessence\u2019 for intelligence. If you can\u2019t figure out the\nrelevant portions of the changing environment fast enough to fend for\nyourself, you are not practically intelligent, however complex you\nare\u201d (326). Thus Dennett relativizes intelligence to processing\nspeed relative to current environment. \n\nTim Maudlin (1989) disagrees. Maudlin considers the time-scale problem\npointed to by other writers, and concludes, contra Dennett, that the\nextreme slowness of a computational system does not violate any\nnecessary conditions on thinking or consciousness. Furthermore,\nSearle\u2019s main claim is about understanding, not intelligence or\nbeing quick-witted. If we were to encounter extra-terrestrials that\ncould process information a thousand times more quickly than we do, it\nseems that would show nothing about our own slow-poke ability to\nunderstand the languages we speak.\n\nSteven Pinker (1997) also holds that Searle relies on untutored\nintuitions. Pinker endorses the Churchlands\u2019 (1990)\ncounterexample of an analogous thought experiment of waving a magnet\nand not generating light, noting that this outcome would not disprove\nMaxwell\u2019s theory that light consists of electromagnetic waves.\nPinker holds that the key issue is speed: \u201cThe thought\nexperiment slows down the waves to a range to which we humans no\nlonger see them as light. By trusting our intuitions in the thought\nexperiment, we falsely conclude that rapid waves cannot be light\neither. Similarly, Searle has slowed down the mental computations to a\nrange in which we humans no longer think of it as understanding (since\nunderstanding is ordinarily much faster)\u201d (94\u201395). Howard\nGardiner, a supporter of Searle\u2019s conclusions regarding the\nroom, makes a similar point about understanding. Gardiner addresses\nthe Chinese Room argument in his book The Mind\u2019s New\nScience (1985, 171\u2013177). Gardiner considers all the\nstandard replies to the Chinese Room argument and concludes that\nSearle is correct about the room: \u201c\u2026the word understand\nhas been unduly stretched in the case of the Chinese room\n\u2026.\u201d (175).\n\nThus several in this group of critics argue that speed affects our\nwillingness to attribute intelligence and understanding to a slow\nsystem, such as that in the Chinese Room. The result may simply be\nthat our intuitions regarding the Chinese Room are unreliable, and\nthus the man in the room, in implementing the program, may understand\nChinese despite intuitions to the contrary (Maudlin and Pinker). Or it\nmay be that the slowness marks a crucial difference between the\nsimulation in the room and what a fast computer does, such that the\nman is not intelligent while the computer system is (Dennett).\n",
