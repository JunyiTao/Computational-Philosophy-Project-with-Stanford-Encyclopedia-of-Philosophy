    "preamble": "\n\nThe analysis of descriptions has played an important\u00a0role in\ndebates about metaphysics, epistemology, semantics, psychology, logic\nand linguistics ever since the publication of Bertrand Russell\u2019s paper\n\u201cOn Denoting,\u201d in 1905.\u00a0 Despite the apparent\nsimplicity of definite and indefinite descriptions, the past 100+\nyears have seen heated debates about their proper analysis. For\nexample, some philosophers and linguists treat definite descriptions\nas referential expressions, others treat them as quantificational\nexpressions, and some treat them as predicational expressions. Other\nanalyses of descriptions have held that the determiners\n\u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 do not make a semantical\ncontribution, but rather a pragmatic contribution to what is\ncommunicated. Some recent work in linguistics has even called into\nquestion the idea that definite and indefinite determiners correspond\nto logical elements in natural language.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs we will see, none of this undermines the idea that some expressions\nin natural language are referential and others quantificational, or\nthat the analysis of these questions isn\u2019t relevant to\nRussell\u2019s epistemological and metaphysical projects, but it is\nto suggest that the role of the English words \u2018the\u2019 and\n\u2018a\u2019 (and their counterparts in other languages) may be\nless clear than philosophers in the century following Russell\u2019s paper\nhave imagined.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. What are Descriptions?\n\nOrdinarily, when philosophers talk about descriptions, they have two\nkinds of expressions in mind: definite descriptions\u2014understood\nto be phrases of the form \u2018the F\u2019 (and their\nequivalents in other languages), and indefinite\ndescriptions\u2014understood to be phrases of the form \u2018an\nF\u2019 (and their equivalents in other languages). As we\nwill see, this way of carving up the kinds of descriptions is far too\nsimple.\u00a0First, there are many kinds of expressions that appear to\nhave this form but that are often argued not to be descriptions. For\nexample, in the expression \u2018John is a lawyer\u2019 it is often\nclaimed that \u2018a lawyer\u2019 is not a genuine description, but\nis rather something different\u2014a predicate for example.\n\nSecond, it is arguable that there are many expressions having surface\nforms quite different from \u2018the F\u2019 or \u2018an\nF\u2019 that could count as being descriptions. For example,\nit seems quite plausible that possessives like \u2018my father\u2019\nare descriptions (as in \u2018the father of me\u2019). Russell also\nproposed that ordinary proper names could be construed as definite\ndescriptions in disguise. Thus a name like \u2018Aristotle\u2019\nmight be taken as shorthand for \u2018the student of Plato who taught\nAlexander, wrote The Nichomachean Ethics etc.\u2019. Furthermore, as\nwe will see, it has been argued that pronouns like \u2018it\u2019\nmight \u201cstand proxy\u201d for descriptions. So, for example, the\npronoun in (1) might be taken to stand proxy for the corresponding\ndefinite description (indicated by square brackets) in (1\u2032).\n\n(1) A man came in the room. He turned on the TV.\n\n\n(1\u2032) A man came in the room. [The man who came in the room]\nturned on the TV.\n\n\nSimilarly, Ludlow (2001) suggested that temporal anaphors like\n\u2018then\u2019 and modal anaphors like \u2018that\u2019 (in\n\u2018that would have been unfortunate\u2019) are descriptions in\ndisguise.\n\nFinally, as noted above, some recent analyses of descriptions have\nconverged on the view that the contributions the determiners\n\u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 make are not semantical, but\nrather pragmatic or even syntactic in nature. All of these\npossibilities will be discussed in due course, but for now we will\nbegin with the analysis of \u2018the F\u2019 and \u2018an\nF\u2019 first taken up in Russell (1905, 1919).\n2. Russell\u2019s Theory of Descriptions\n\nThe key idea of Russell\u2019s proposal is that a sentence like (2)\ncontaining an indefinite description, is understood to have the\nlogical form in (2\u2032),\n\n(2) An F is G.\n\n\n(2\u2032) \u2203x(Fx &\nGx)\n\n\nand a sentence like (3) containing a definite description is\nunderstood to have the logical form in (3\u2032).\n\n(3) The F is G.\n\n\n(3\u2032) \u2203x(Fx &\n\u2200y(Fy \u2192 x=y) & Gx)\n\n\nBoiled down to its simplest non-technical form, the idea is that an\nexpression of the form in (3) is shorthand for the conjunction of\nthree claims:\n\n(3a) There is an F.\n\n(3b) At most one thing is F.\n\n(3c) Something that is F is G.\n\n\n(Following Neale (1990) we will find it useful to substitute\n(3c\u2032) for (3c), which retains Russell\u2019s truth conditions\nand (as we will see) allows us to extend the theory to plural\ndescriptions in a natural way.)\n\n(3c\u2032) Everything that is F is G.\n\n\nThus tweaked, Russell\u2019s analysis is that the semantics of a\ndefinite description in a sentence involves an existence\nclaim, a uniqueness claim, and a maximality\nclaim.\n3. Motivations for Russell\u2019s Theory of Descriptions\n\nThere are three main motivations for the theory of descriptions; the\nfirst is metaphysical, the second involves semantical concerns in the\nphilosophy of language, and the third is epistemological.\n3.1 Metaphysical motivations for Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions\n\nConsider a negative existential sentence like (4).\n\n(4) The present king of France does not exist.\n\n\nBecause definite descriptions are devices of quantification on\nRussell\u2019s view, they can enter into scope relations with other\noperators\u2014in this case, for example, negation. Accordingly,\nthere is a kind of ambiguity in (4): on one reading it can be\ninterpreted as asserting that it is not the case that the present king\nof France exists, while on another reading it can be interpreted as\nasserting, about the present king of France, that he doesn't\nexist. These two reading can be captured by a difference in logical\nform, i.e., by representing the difference using the following two\nlogical forms.\n\n(4a) not ([the x: x is a present king of France]\nx exists)\n\n\n(4b) [the x: x is a present king of France] not\n(x exists)\n\n\nHere we are using the restricted quantifier notation adopted\nin Neale (1990). So for example, we read:\n\n(5) [the x: Fx](Gx)\n\n\nas saying \u201cthe x such that x is F, is\nsuch that x is G\u201d. The material in the square\nbrackets gives the restriction on the quantifier, and the\nformula in parentheses after the bracket constitutes the scope of the\nrestricted quantifier. (We sometimes drop the outer parentheses when\nit is clear what the scope of the restricted quantifier is, and we\nsometimes add parentheses around the entire formula for\ndisambiguation.) Thus, (4a) captures the fact that the negation has\nwide scope in a manner that can be glossed thus: it is not the case\nthat the x such that x is the present king of France\nexists. Whereas (4b) gives the restricted quantifier wide scope, in a\nmanner that can be glossed this way: the x such that\nx is the present king of France does not exist.\n\nIf one wants to avoid the ontological entanglements of nonexistent\nobjects, then one is free to say that (4b) is false (since it involves\nquantifying over things that don\u2019t exist) but that (4a) is true\n(since it is not the case that there is a present king of France).\nWhat is negated in (4a) is not a claim about some particular\nindividual, but rather a general claim about the world\u2014in effect\na claim that the world contains exactly one individual that is\npresently the king of France and that whoever is presently the king of\nFrance exists.\n3.2 Semantical motivations for Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions\n\nRussell also had a number of concerns that today we might call\n\u201csemantical\u201d. Consider the expressions \u2018the Morning\nStar\u2019 and \u2018the Evening Star\u2019. Both refer to (or at\nleast denote) the planet Venus, but there are contexts in which it\nseems incorrect to say that they have the same meaning. For example,\nit was an astronomical discovery that the Morning Star was identical\nto the Evening Star, so it would be odd to treat an expression like\n\u2018The Morning Star is the Evening Star\u2019 as merely asserting\nsome object to be self-identical. In a similar vein, if we utter\n(6),\n\n(6) George wondered whether the Morning Star is the Evening Star.\n\n\nwe are most likely not saying that George was curious about whether\nVenus was identical to itself.\n\nFrege proposed that that the solution to this puzzle involved the\nintroduction of senses\u2014abstract objects that fix the referents\nof these expressions, each having a different cognitive significance.\nIn the case of (6), the Fregean solution would be to say that there\nare different senses attached to \u2018the Morning Star\u2019 and\n\u2018the Evening Star\u2019. If we take these expressions to be\nstanding proxy for definite descriptions, then (6) can be unpacked as\nin (6\u2032).\n\n(6\u2032) George wondered whether the star that appears in the\nmorning is identical to the star that appears in the evening.\n\n\nRussell saw that scope relations are relevant here. So, for example,\nsentences like (6) evince what are sometimes called de\ndicto/de re ambiguities. There are circumstances under\nwhich George has some object in particular in mind and is wondering,\nof that object, whether it is the star that appears in the evening. We\ncan use (6) to report this fact as well; In this case we may think of\nthe description as taking wide scope relative to the propositional\nattitude verb \u2018wondered\u2019 yielding a logical form like\n(7).\n\n(7) The star x that appears in the morning is such that\nGeorge wondered whether x is identical to the star that\nappears in the evening.\n\n\nAlternatively, if George has gone mad and is in fact wondering about\nthe law of identity, this may be represented as in (8), where both\ndescriptions have wide scope.\n\n(8) The star x that appears in the morning is such that the\nstar y that appears in the evening is such that George\nwondered whether x is identical to y.\n\n\nThese considerations speak to a particular semantic consequence, but\nas Coppock (forthcoming) notes, the analysis of descriptions has also\nbecome an inflection point in global disputes around semantic\nframeworks. For example Coppock notes that the analysis of\ndescriptions may provide evidence in the choice between Situation\nSemantics (and presumably, Davidson-style event-based semantic\ntheories)\u00a0and Dynamic Semantics.\n3.3 Epistemological motivations for Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions\n\nMetaphysical and semantical concerns were important to Russell in his\n1905 paper, but epistemological concerns were no less significant.\nThis became particularly clear when he authored his (1910\u201311)\npaper \u201cKnowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by\nDescription.\u201d In that paper, Russell distinguished between\nobjects that we are directly acquainted with and objects that we only\nknow under a description. So, for example, I might know myself by\nacquaintance, but I know the tallest man in Iowa only under a\ndescription.\n\nLudlow (2002) argued that the Cartesianism in Russell\u2019s\npsychology and epistemology led him into difficulties here. The\nproblem is that we can be in error as to whether we are directly\nacquainted with someone (did I really have lunch with a colleague or\nwas that a sophisticated hologram?) and this concern (coupled with the\nCartesianism that Russell held at that point in his career) propelled\nRussell to radically minimize the class of cases where we have\nacquaintance\u2014down to what he called \u201cegocentric\nparticulars,\u201d which is basically to say I\u2019m only\nacquainted with myself and sense data. This in turn led Russell to\nextend the theory of descriptions to almost all uses of\nnames\u2014treating them as definite descriptions in disguise.\n\nRussell could have saved himself from some of the more troubling\nconsequences of his view if he had jettisoned the Cartesianism and\nopted for a more liberal notion of acquaintance. Alternatively, if\nHawthorne and Manley (2012) are correct, the true mistake would have\ncome in at the beginning\u2014with the linking of acquaintance and\nreference. In their view a case can be made that reference comes much\ncheaper than Russell imagined. It would follow that descriptions need\nnot be relied upon as heavily as he imagined\n4. Extensions of the Theory of Descriptions\n\nThe analysis of descriptions has been extended from canonical examples\nof descriptions (expressions of the form \u2018the F\u2019\nand \u2018an F\u2019) to expressions that don\u2019t have\nthis surface form. As we noted in section 3, one of the key\nmotivations for Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions was the idea\nthat it could ameliorate the problem of non-denoting\nexpressions\u2014expressions like \u2018the golden mountain\u2019,\nand \u2018the present king of France\u2019. But the account has been\nextended to other constructions as well, including proper names,\npronouns, and temporal anaphors, all with mixed results.\n4.1 Descriptive theories of proper names\n\nIf the theory of descriptions can unburden us metaphysically in the\ncase of nondenoting expressions like \u2018the present king of\nFrance\u2019 can it do the same for us with nondenoting names like\n\u2018Pegasus\u2019? Perhaps, but there is no shortage of\ndifficulties.\n\nOne problem has to do with the fact that there is often no single\nshared description for certain fictions. Even a simple case like\n\u2018Santa Claus\u2019 presents difficulties here. Many people will\nassociate many different descriptions with the name \u2018Santa\nClaus\u2019. Which, if any of those descriptions is the correct one,\nand in what sense can we say that all the people deploying the name\n\u2018Santa Claus\u2019 and associating different descriptions with\nthe term are talking about the same thing? Complicating the matter\nfurther, others might not use the term \u2018Santa Claus\u2019 but a\nname like \u2018Saint Nick\u2019 or \u2018Babbo Natale\u2019, and\nassociate those terms with descriptions that converge to some degree\nwith typical Santa descriptions.\n\nAt best the Russellian can argue that others are in the same boat\nhere. Consider the option of non-existent objects. If such objects are\nindividuated by their properties then we can again ask which\nproperties the non-existent object Santa Claus is supposed to have.\nAnd is the Italian who deploys the term \u2018Babbo Natale\u2019\ntalking about the same nonexistent object as an American that deploys\nthe name \u2018Santa Claus\u2019? (See Everett and Hofweber (2000)\nand French and Wettstein (2001) for papers on these general issues,\nand see Zalta (1983, 1988) for a robust defense of the nonexistent\nobject strategy).\n\nOn the face of it then, a na\u00efve application of the descriptive\ntheory of names faces some serious difficulties. Devitt and Sterelney\n(1998, 48 ff.) catalogue them as follows:\n\nThe principled basis objection. There are a number of\ndifferent descriptions that people might associate with a name like\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019. An historian might favor the description of\n\u2018the teacher of Alexander the Great\u2019, a Catholic Church\nhistorian might know him under the description of \u2018the leading\ninfluence on Saint Aquinas\u2019, some philosophers might know him\nunder the description of \u2018the pupil of Plato and author of\nThe Metaphysics and The Nichomachean Ethics\u2019,\nPlato himself might have known him under the description \u2018the\nobnoxious student of mine.\u2019 Which of these descriptions is the\ncorrect one, what is the principled basis that determines which\ndescription is correct? \nThe unwanted ambiguity objection. Suppose that we respond to\nthe principled basis objection by letting many flowers bloom. That is,\nsuppose we argue that there is no single correct description\nassociated with the name but there are many. We now run into the teeth\nof the problem of unwanted ambiguity. Are there really that many\ndifferent names, each corresponding to an different description? If\nso, why does \u2018Aristotle was Aristotle\u2019 seem so much less\ninformative than \u2018the teacher of Alexander the Great was the\nleading influence on Saint Aquinas\u2019? \nThe unwanted necessity objection. Consider a sentence like\n\u2018Aristotle taught Alexander the Great\u2019. This seems to be a\ncontingent claim\u2014one that is true but matters could have gone\notherwise. Aristotle could have decided it was immoral to take the\nposition, or Phillip of Macedonia could have decided that Aristotle\nwas not the best tutor for his young Alexander. We can imagine\nnumerous possible worlds in which the sentence turns out to be false\n(unlike necessary claims like \u20185+7=12\u2019 which appear to be\ntrue in every possible world). But now consider this sentence with the\ndescription unpacked. We get something like \u2018The pupil of Plato\nand teacher of Alexander the Great taught Alexander the Great\u2019,\nand it seems that this would have to be true in every world in which\nsomeone satisfies the relevant description. The problem is that the\nRussellian analysis seems to turn a contingent proposition into a\nnecessary proposition. \n\n\nSearle (1958, 1969; 162 ff.) offers some modifications designed to\novercome these difficulties with the descriptive theory of names.\nConsider a name like \u2018Socrates\u2019. Is it really part of the\nmeaning of that name that its bearer drank hemlock, taught Plato and\ndid all of the other things that we are told that he did when we study\nthe history of philosophy? Searle suggests that we needn\u2019t\nassociate the meaning of a name with a description that contains all\nof these elements\u2014it might be enough that most of them hold, or\nthat a suitably weighted bundle of them hold. (Other versions of this\nidea were proposed in Strawson (1959; 180 ff.) and Wilson (1959).)\n\nHow does Searle\u2019s proposal help with the objections just listed?\nThe unwanted necessity objection collapses immediately because the use\nof a name does not commit the speaker to the object in question having\nall the properties in the bundle. When I say Aristotle authored the\nNichomachean Ethics it is as though I uttered the\nfollowing:\n\n(9) The individual who is associated with some significant number of\nthese properties (taught by Plato, taught Alexander, wrote the\nNichomachean Ethics, etc.) wrote the Nichomachean\nEthics.\n\n\nSomeone might be associated with this bundle of properties and not\nhave written the Nichomachean Ethics (so long as they had\nenough of the other properties).\n\nThe principled basis objection is supposed to collapse\nbecause there is now no issue of choosing which description is the\ncorrect one\u2014if the theologian, the historian, and the\nphilosopher all associate different descriptions and hence different\nproperties with Aristotle, all of those properties will make it into\nthe bundle of properties for the name \u2018Aristotle\u2019. We\ndon\u2019t need to worry about the principled basis for choosing the\nrelevant properties because we don\u2019t have to choose period. We\ntake them all.\n\nThe unwanted ambiguity objection is supposed to collapse\nbecause every use of the name \u2018Aristotle\u2019 is now\nassociated with the same bundle of properties. \u2018Aristotle is\nAristotle\u2019 is uninformative because it is shorthand for\n(10).\n\n(10) The individual who is associated with some significant number of\nthese properties (taught by Plato, taught Alexander, wrote the\nNichomachean Ethics, etc.) is the individual who is associated with\nsome significant number of these properties (taught by Plato, taught\nAlexander, wrote the Nichomachean Ethics, etc.).\n\n\nAs compelling as Searle\u2019s proposal may seem at first blush, it\nsoon runs into problems of its own. As Devitt and Sterelny observe,\nthe three objections to the traditional descriptive theory of names\ncome creeping back. For starters, one presumably doesn\u2019t want\nevery single fact about Aristotle to make it into the bundle of\nproperties that we associate with his name (that would lead us down\nthe path to an extreme holism in which every fact that we acquire\nchanges the meaning of the name), so what is the principled basis for\ndeciding what goes into the bundle? Worse, what is the principled\nbasis by which we weight the importance of the properties in the\nbundle?\n\nThe unwanted ambiguity objection returns as well if we allow that\ndifferent people will associate different bundles of properties with a\nname or at least weight those properties differently. One might be\ntempted to dodge this problem by arguing that the relevant bundle of\nproperties for a name is socially fixed and does not vary between\nindividuals, but then it is hard to see how names like\n\u2018Scott\u2019 and \u2018Sir Walter\u2019 could be associated\nwith different bundles of properties since the community as a whole is\nlikely to attribute the same bundle of properties (with the same\nweights) to these names. This is a problem, because different bundles\nof properties are needed to distinguish the differences in cognitive\nsignificance between \u2018Scott\u2019 and \u2018Sir Walter\u2019.\nThere is a dilemma then: one can avoid the problem of unwanted\nambiguity only at the expense of the problem of accounting for the\ncognitive significance of names.\n\nFinally, as Kripke (1980) argued, Searle\u2019s solution really\ndoesn\u2019t help with the problem of unwanted necessity. Aristotle\nmight have had none of the properties that we ordinarily associate\nwith his name. Searle certainly didn\u2019t think this was\npossible\u2014for him, if nothing had the properties in question (or\nenough of them) then Aristotle did not exist. But Kripke (ch. 2)\nenlisted a number of arguments to show that the behavior of names in\nmodal environments suggests otherwise. For example even if we concede\nthat Aristotle did all the things he was supposed to have done, it is\nstill the case that Aristotle could have refrained from doing any of\nthe things he did. He could have forsaken philosophy for other\npursuits. He could have been run over by a chariot at age two. But\nthen how do we make sense of a descriptive name in a sentence like\n(11)?\n\n(11) It could have happened that Aristotle was run over by a chariot\nat age two.\n\n\nIf the description is unpacked, we get something like (11\u2032).\n\n(11\u2032) It could have happened that the philosopher who was taught\nby Plato, taught Alexander, etc. was run over by a chariot at age two.\n\n\nBut (11\u2032) is false. There is no nearby possible world where\nAristotle did all those things by age two.\n\nKripke held that the behavior of names in these environments could\nonly be explained if we think of the names as being rigid\ndesignators\u2014i.e., as devices that rigidly pick out an individual\nacross possible worlds. Kripke also stressed that this is not really a\npoint about conditional or modal sentences\u2014the same point can be\nmade for simple declarative sentences evaluated in a counterfactual\nsituation. So, for example, take a simple sentence like (12).\n\n(12) Aristotle was run over by a chariot at age two.\n\n\nWe can evaluate this sentence in other possible worlds. We can say\nthat it might have been true under certain circumstances. But it does\nnot seem plausible that there is a nearby possible world where the\nfollowing is true.\n\n(13) The philosopher who was taught by Plato, taught Alexander, etc.\nwas run over by a chariot at age two.\n\n\nFinally, Donnellan (1972) and Kripke (1980) both argued that the\nDescriptive Theory of Names suffers from an important epistemological\ndefect. The descriptions that we associate with names routinely do not\ndescribe the individuals that we intend to refer to. Asked to come up\nwith a description to substitute for the name \u2018Einstein\u2019,\nmany people would write \u2018The inventor of the atom bomb\u2019\n(which of course he was not). Others might write \u2018the inventor\nof the theory of relativity\u2019, but then asked what the theory of\nrelativity was would respond \u2018the theory that Einstein\ninvented\u2019. The descriptive information that we associate with\nnames just is not sufficient to pick out the intended referent.\n\nKripke\u2019s positive proposal\u2014suggestion really\u2014was\nthat names are associated with a causal chain; there is an initial\nbaptism of an individual (e.g., Albert Einstein as \u2018Albert\nEinstein\u2019) and that referent is passed along to other users of\nthe name. Likewise the referent of \u2018Aristotle\u2019 is not\nfixed by some description, but by a causal chain linking our use of\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019 with some historical individual. (This is not\nthe place for an extended discussion of this proposal, but see Devitt\n1981 and Salmon 1991 for development of this idea and Evans (1973,\n1980) for criticism.)\n\nIn spite of the great force of Kripke\u2019s criticism of the\ndescriptive theory of names, there have been some significant attempts\nto answer them. One idea (explored by Loar (1976), McDowell (1977),\nand Schiffer (1978)) would have the description be something like\n\u2018the individual designated by the name \u2018Aristotle\u2019.\nFor Kripke (1980), and Devitt (1981) this sort of approach was\nhopelessly circular. Indeed, Devitt and Sterelny disparagingly\nreferred to the position as \u201ccircular descriptivism\u201d (but\nsee Kroon (1989) for an attempt to disarm the circularity charge).\nAnother idea (taken up in Kroon (1987) and Jackson (1998)) was to\nbuild reference to the causal chain into the description itself. Thus,\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019 might stand proxy for \u2018the individual\nlinked by a causal chain to \u2018Aristotle\u2019\u2019 (this view\nwas dubbed \u201ccausal descriptivism\u201d by Lewis (1984)).\nWhatever the merits of these views, they clearly abandon some of the\nkey motivations for the descriptive theories of names\u2014in\nparticular the idea that the description could do the work of\nproviding the sense of the name.\n\nStill, from a linguistic point of view, we should note that there are\nfeatures of names in natural language that make them appear to be\nsimilar to descriptions. Names can take determiners like\n\u2018a\u2019 and \u2018the\u2019 (indeed in some languages they\nroutinely do so), which suggests that they are behaving more like\nnouns than like saturated referring expression. Indeed it is a\nwidespread linguistic analysis of names that they have possibly empty\ndeterminer positions, so that a name like Aristotle has at a minimum\nthe following structure, which represents a syntactic structure for a\ndeterminer phrase having an empty determiner and the noun\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019 as constituents:\n\n[DP [Det \u2205 ] [N Aristotle]]\n\n\nIn addition, Burge (1973) offered a number of arguments in support of\nthe idea that names really are predicates, and further support has\ncome from Hornsby (1976), Larson and Segal (1995) and Eluguardo\n(2002). (But see Boer (1975), Bach (1987), and Higginbotham (1988) for\ncriticism.)\n\nThe Burge story had the determiner as something like a bare\ndemonstrative. It is not a long step to the supposition that the\ndefault interpretation of the null element is to treat it as the\ndefinite determiner \u2018the\u2019. This is in effect the proposal\noffered in Larson and Segal (1995); \u2018Aristotle\u2019 stands in\nfor an incomplete definite description of the form \u2018the\nAristotle\u2019. In both cases, the predicate in question would be\nsomething like being named \u2018Aristotle\u2019, so again it is\ndifficult to see how this general approach (without emendation) can\nsatisfy Russell\u2019s desiderata that the description play the role\nof senses.\n\nAn alternative riff on these ideas which has been widely discussed,\nbut not, so far as I know, published, would be to suppose that there\nis a rigid property of being Aristotle\u2014one that only Aristotle\ncould have in any possible world (this property would be completely\nindependent of being named \u2018Aristotle\u2019). The idea is that\nthe content of the description could consist solely of that property.\nFor example, when we say that \u2018Aristotle might have been run\nover by a chariot\u2019 we would in effect be saying there is a\npossible world in which the unique individual who has the property of\nbeing Aristotle was run over by a chariot. It seems that charges of\ncircularity are not so easily advanced here, although the view does\nraise questions about the nature of these rigid properties and our\nepistemic access to them. (See Parsons (1982) for an account of the\nlogic of rigid properties.)\n\nAnother class of responses has attempted to retain the standard\ndescriptive content of names but moved to circumvent Kripke\u2019s\nmodal worries. Dummett (1973; 111\u2013135, 1981) and Sosa (1996; ch.\n3, 2001) proposed that the behavior of names in modal contexts can be\naccounted for if we take names to be descriptions with mandatory wide\nscope. So, for example, (11) could be taken to have the following\nlogical form.\n\n(11\u2033) [The x: x taught Alexander etc.]\npossibly (it was the case that x was run over by a chariot at\nage two)\n\n\nKripke discussed this possibility briefly in the Preface to (1980),\nholding that the move overlooks the fact that we can simply evaluate\n(12) in other possible worlds, hence no embedding within modal\noperators is really necessary. For that matter, consider a sentence\nlike \u2018(12) might have been true\u2019. How does a wide scope\nstory help us in this case? More recently, Soames (2002; ch. 2) has\nexpanded on Kripke\u2019s points and marshaled a number of additional\narguments against the wide scope thesis, including the observation\nthat if one embeds a name within a propositional attitude environment\nand in turn embeds the propositional attitude in a modal environment\nthen one is in the peculiar position of needing the description to\nescape the modal environment (to honor the rigidity facts) but not\nescape the propositional attitude environment (to honor the\n\u2018Scott\u2019/\u2018Sir Walter\u2019 cases that Russell (1905)\nemployed to motivate the descriptive theory of names). In other words,\nthe description theorists need to have their cake and eat it too.\n\nAnother possibility (considered in Nelson (2002)) would be to argue\nthat names are \u201crigidified descriptions\u201d (i.e.,\ndescriptions like \u2018The individual who actually was a student of\nPlato, taught Alexander, etc.\u2019 or perhaps rigidified causal\ndescriptions. This general strategy is criticized by Soames (2002; ch.\n2), who argues that \u2018the actual F is G\u2019\nand \u2018n is G\u2019, where n is a\nname, do not express the same proposition. The argument for this turns\non cases where these expressions are embedded in propositional\nattitude environments, as in (14a) and (14b).\n\n(14a) Smith believes that n is G.\n\n(14b) Smith believes that the actual F is G.\n\n\nAccording to Soames, there are contexts of utterance and worlds of\nevaluation where (14a) is true but (14b) is false. Accordingly,\n\u2018the actual F is G\u2019 and\n\u2018n is G\u2019 cannot express the same\nproposition. Hence names cannot be rigidified descriptions. See Nelson\n(2002) for a response to this argument.\u00a0(Accounts of rigidified\ndescriptions have been offered elsewhere,\u00a0see for example Zalta\n(1988; chapter 5), but typically not as a way to account for the\nbehavior of descriptions in propositional attitude environments.)\n\nYet another approach to defending descriptions would be to employ a\n\u201c2-dimensionalist\u201d semantics (in the sense of Stalnaker\n(1978, 1990), Davies and Humberstone (1980)) to account for the\nbehavior of descriptive names in modal environments. Some form of this\nidea has been offered by Evans (1982), Stanley (1997a, 1997b),\nChalmers (2000, 2002), and Jackson (1998). Here the basic idea is that\nthe content of a description picks out different contents in different\npossible worlds. Accordingly, if we want to evaluate the descriptive\ncontent of \u2018Aristotle\u2019 in another possible world, we do\nnot use the descriptive content \u2018student of Plato\u2026\u2019\nin every world, since that is only an appropriate descriptive content\nfor some worlds. In other worlds we will draw on other descriptive\ncontents. As Jackson (1998, 112) puts the idea:\n\nIf speakers can say what refers to what when various possible worlds\nare described to them, description theorists can identify the property\nassociated in their [the speaker\u2019s] minds with, for example, the\nword \u2018water\u2019: it is the disjunction of the properties that\nguide the speaker in each particular possible world when they say\nwhich stuff, if any, in each world counts as water. This disjunction\nis in their minds in the sense that they can deliver the answer for\neach possible world when it is described in sufficient detail, but it\nis implicit in the sense that the pattern that brings the various\ndisjuncts together as part of the, possibly highly complex,\ndisjunction may be one they cannot state.\n\n\nSoames (2009) has responded that this particular 2-dimensionalist\napproach is tantamount to the claim that descriptive theories of\nreference determination are priori irrefutable, since any evidence\nthat a term refers to an object is automatically taken to demonstrate\nthe existence of an implicit description in our minds that\nsuccessfully determines reference, whether or not we can successfully\nstate it. Additional criticism of 2-dimensionalism criticism can be\nfound in Block and Stalnaker (1998) and Byrne and Pryor (2006).\n4.2 Descriptive theories of pronominal anaphora\n\nConsider sentence (1) again.\n\n(1) A man came in the room. He turned on the TV.\n\n\nOne of the arguments that Strawson (1952) enlisted on behalf of the\nreferential theory of descriptions was the following. Since the\npronoun in (1) gets its content from the description that it is\nanaphoric on, and because the pronoun refers, it must be the case that\nthe description also refers. Strawson\u2019s idea was that\ndescriptions refer because their anaphoric pronouns do.\n\nThere are obviously two responses to Strawson here. One may either\nreject the idea that the content of the pronoun is in some sense\ndependent upon the description (for example, one might claim it\nindependently picks out some object raised to salience (Lewis 1979),\none might claim that it is a bound variable (Geach 1962)), or one can\nargue that the pronoun is a kind of definite description in disguise.\nThis third idea has been explored by Parsons (1978, Other Internet\nResources), Cooper (1979), Davies (1981), Neale (1990, ch. 6), Heim\n(1990), Ludlow (1994), van Rooy (2001), and Elbourne (2005) (the view\nis sometimes attributed to Evans (1977), but it is more accurate to\nsay that he thought the pronouns had their references fixed rigidly by\ndescriptive content). As noted above, the basic idea is that the\npronoun in (1) may stand proxy for the square-bracketed definite\ndescription in (1\u2032).\n\n(1\u2032) A man came in. [The man who came in the room] turned on the\nTV.\n\n\nThe philosophical attraction of this view should be obvious. What it\nallows us to do is to make sense of cases where we employ nondenoting\npronouns in negative existentials, belief reports, and fictional\ncontexts. Examples would be the following:\n\n\n(15) The present king of France doesn\u2019t clean my pool. He\ndoesn\u2019t exist, either.\n\n(16) Mary believes that the present king of France exists and that he\ncleans my pool.\n\n\nClearly if these pronouns are referring expressions then any victories\nwon through the theory of descriptions are going to be fleeting. In\neffect, all the unwelcome metaphysical commitments that we banished by\nusing descriptions would re-enter via the back door as soon as we\nemploy anaphoric pronouns in our discourse. But if we treat anaphors\nas standing proxy for descriptions, the back door is blocked as\nwell.\n\nConsider an example like (16), with the descriptive material spelled\nout.\n\n(16\u2032) Mary believes that ([the x: x is a\npresent king of France](x exists) and [the x:\nx is a present king of France & x\nexists](x cleans my pool))\n\n\nMary\u2019s belief is strange, but general for all that, so we can\nreport it without being committed to the existence of a present king\nof France.\n\nNor is this strategy necessarily limited to pronominal anaphora.\nLudlow (1999, 2000) has argued that temporal and modal anaphora can be\nhandled in a similar manner. In effect, one can take a temporal\nanaphor as standing proxy for a when-clause and a modal anaphor like\n\u2018that\u2019 in \u2018that would have hurt\u2019 as standing\nproxy for the antecedent of a conditional.\n\nTo illustrate, consider an example like (17), due to Partee\n(1972).\n\n(17) I turned the stove off.\n\n\nNow clearly this does not mean that I turned the stove off once in my\nlife, but rather there is intuitively some relevant time when I turned\nit off\u2014for example, when I left the house this morning. The\nstandard analysis would have it that I refer to a past time or past\ntime interval here, but such an analysis does not go down well with\npresentists, who do not believe that there are such intervals, and at\na minimum we might think there is something epistemologically\ntroubling about referring to past and future times (to see this,\nconsider what a Russellian might say, given that some notion of direct\nacquaintance is required on the Russellian view). An alternative would\nbe to suppose that the implicit temporal anaphora here can be\naccounted for by the introduction of descriptive material\u2014an\nexplicit temporal when-clause\u2014as in (18), for example.\n\n(18) I turned the stove off [when I left the house this morning].\n\n\nThe presentist can then treat \u2018when\u2019 as a primitive tense\nthat holds between propositions. (See Ludlow (1999) for discussion of\ndifficulties with this strategy.) As in the pronominal anaphora case,\ndescriptive material does the work that reference does in most other\naccounts of the semantics of temporal and modal discourse. Again, the\ngoal is metaphysical austerity and faithfulness to our epistemic\nposition.\n\nClearly descriptive anaphora represents a powerful extension of\nRussell\u2019s theory of descriptions and a useful tool for\npresentists and modal antirealists. For all of that, the theory has\nencountered a number of objections. Consider (19), for example, and a\nparaphrase (20) in which the pronoun is rendered as a description.\n\n\n(19) If a man enters the room, he will turn the switch.\n\n(20) If a man enters the room, the man who enters will turn the\nswitch.\n\n\nHeim (1982) observed that (20) (unlike (19)) implies that a unique man\nentered the room and that (20) will therefore be false if two men\nenter the room. The question is, is there some way to answer this\nobjection and retain the descriptive analysis of anaphora? Davies\n(1981), Lappin (1989), Neale (1990, chapter 6), Krifka (1996), and\nYoon (1996) explored the possibility that the descriptive pronouns are\nin fact numberless\u2014that is, the pronoun in (20) might in fact be\nproxy for something like \u2018the man or men who enter\u2019. (See\nKanazawa (2001) for a literature review and criticism of this\nidea.)\n\nAnother idea, considered in Heim (1990), Ludlow (1994), and Elbourne\n(2005) is to see how descriptive theories of pronouns fare when\nembedded within an event-based (or situation based) theories of\nconditionals like those articulated by Berman (1987), Kratzer (1989),\nand Lycan (1984). On an event-based analysis of conditionals, we would\nexpect a treatment of (19) along the lines of (21).\n\n(21) For every minimal event/situation in which a man enters the room,\nhe flips the switch in that event/situation.\n\n\nSentence (21) seems to accurately reflect the truth conditions of\n\u2018He will turn the switch\u2019, even in the case where two men\nturn the switch simultaneously. To see this we need merely recognize\nthat even though two men (say Ralph and Norton) may turn the switch\nsimultaneously, it is still the case that we can recognize two\nindependent minimal events; one where Ralph turns the switch and one\nwhere Norton turns the switch. The strategy is to show that the\nsupposed loss of uniqueness is an epiphenomenon, and is due to the\nfact that the descriptive pronoun\u2019s denotation is relativized to\nevents.\n\nUnfortunately, there are more sophisticated versions of these cases\nwhere simple relativization to events will not do. These include the\nsage plant examples discussed in Heim (1982, 1990) and Kadmon\n(1990).\n\n(22) If a man buys a plant he buys nine others along with it.\n\n\nHere the problem is that the minimal event appears to contain ten sage\nplants, so we are left to ask how the pronoun, rendered as a definite\ndescription complete with a uniqueness claim, is supposed to work.\nThere is no unique sage plant in the minimal events. Or at least a\nmore detailed story needs to be told.\n\nFinally, there is (23). (Heim (1990) attributes the example to Hans\nKamp and Jan van Eijk).\n\n(23) If a bishop meets another bishop, he blesses him.\n\n\nThe interesting feature of this example is that the uniqueness\nimplications of the definite descriptions remain problematic, for they\nimply that there is a unique satisfier of the description in each\nevent. But notice that because the bishops bless each other, it\nappears there is no unique individual that satisfies either\ndescription in the consequent of (23 ). This class of problems,\nsometimes called bishop sentences, has yielded a number of\nproposed solutions. For example, Elbourne (2005) has argued that the\nminimal situation story can suffice if there are subsituations\ncontaining only one bishop. Here is a crude version of the idea: If\nthere is a subsituation s1 with only one bishop and a subsituation s2\nwith one different bishop, there could be a containing situation s0 in\nwhich the bishops from those subsituations bless each other (see Kroll\n(2008) and Elbourne (2009, 2010) for further discussion).\n\nAn alternative idea is to treat the pronoun in these cases as\nsemantically akin to an indefinite description rather than a definite\ndescription. (See Groendijk and Stokhof (1991), Chierchia (1996), van\nder Does (1994), and also see van Rooy (2001) for criticism. The\nproposal in King (1978) has a similar effect.) If we make this move,\nthen (24) might be glossed as in (24\u2032).\n\n(24\u2032) If a bishop meets another bishop, a bishop that meets\nanother bishop blesses a bishop that is met by another bishop.\n\n\nSimilarly, the sage plant example in (23) would receive the gloss in\n(23\u2032).\n\n(23\u2032) If a man buys a sage plant he buys nine others along with\na sage plant he bought.\n\n\nSuch solutions thus surrender the uniqueness entailment in\nRussell\u2019s proposal (we will return to this idea in section 6.1).\nOf course, as Kadmon (1990) stressed, pronouns typically do appear to\nintroduce uniqueness, as an example like (25) shows.\n\n(25) Leif has a chair. It is in the kitchen.\n\n\nNotice that the first sentence doesn\u2019t introduce uniqueness, so\nthe pronoun introduces something that indefinites do not. What this\nmeans is that whatever account we give of pronouns\u2014through\ndynamic semantics or whatever\u2014we will want to account for this\nvariation in interpretation in a principled way. We want to know\nprecisely why a pronoun looks like a definite description here, but an\nindefinite description there. Whether extant accounts are satisfactory\nin this respect is subject to debate.\n\nOf course, none of this is to say that solving this problem will close\nthe book on the analysis of descriptive pronouns. A number of other\npuzzles remain, including the problem of pronominal contradiction,\nwhich has been discussed by Strawson (1952), Davies (1981), Ludlow and\nNeale (1991), and van Rooy (2001) among many others. Consider the\nfollowing brief dialogue.\n\nA: A man fell in front of the train.\n\nB: He didn\u2019t fall, he was pushed.\n\n\nThe problem is that if the pronoun is to have its descriptive content\nrecovered from previous discourse, the pronoun \u2018He\u2019 is\ngoing to stand proxy for a description like \u2018the man who fell in\nfront of the train\u2019 or \u2018a man who fell in front of the\ntrain\u2019. Here, considerations about uniqueness implications are\nof little help. One possibility, advocated by Davies (1981) and Ludlow\nand Neale (1991) is to say that speaker B is engaged in a kind of\npretense\u2014playing along with speaker A, as if saying with scare\nquotes something like B\u2032.\n\nB\u2032: The \u201cman who fell in front of the train\u201d\ndidn\u2019t fall, he was pushed.\n\n Other strategies are also in play, for example one might ignore\nthe descriptive content of the antecedent and build the content out of\nthematic roles like agent and theme (Ludlow 1994) or\nphi-features\u00a0represented in the pronoun like gender\n(\u2018she\u2019 as \u201cthe feminine entity\u201d; Ahn 2019), or\nperhaps metalinguistic material (\u201cthe person you spoke\nof\u201d). Whatever the ultimate disposition of these cases, it is\nfair to say that there are more issues here than whether pronouns are\nto be treated as standing proxy for definite descriptions or\nindefinite descriptions.\n4.3 Indefinite descriptions\n\nMost of the action in the philosophy of language has been with\ndefinite descriptions, but indefinite descriptions have also generated\na fair bit of attention\u2014some of it mirroring the debates about\ndefinite descriptions. For example Chastain (1975), Donnellan (1978),\nWilson (1978), and Fodor and Sag (1982), held that indefinite\ndescriptions are ambiguous between referential and quantificational\ninterpretations. That is to say, there are referential and\nquantificational uses of indefinite descriptions and these are a\nreflex of a genuine semantical ambiguity. The basic structure of their\nargument was the following. Referential uses of indefinites must be\neither a function of quantifier scope or a semantically referential\nindefinite determiner. Since indefinites with the relevant scopal\nproperties would violate standard syntactic constraints, indefinites\nmust in some cases be semantically referential.\n\nExamples of the kinds of syntactic considerations they had in mind\ninclude island constraints like the following. Quantified expressions\nare ordinarily considered to be clause bound. So, for example, a\nsentence like (26) is not supposed to have the interpretation in\n(26\u2032), where the quantified expression takes wide scope.\n\n\n(26) Someone believes that every man I know is angry.\n\n(26\u2032) *[every y: man(y) and know(I,y)]([Some\nx: person(x)](x believes that y is\nangry))\n\n\nOn the other hand, it seems more natural to say that (27) can have the\ninterpretation corresponding to the structure in (27\u2032).\n\n\n(27) Everyone believes that a man I know is angry.\n\n(27\u2032) [An x: man(x) and\nknow(I,x)]([every y: person(y)](y\nbelieves that x is angry))\n\n\nA more compelling example of an island constraint would be the\nantecedent of a conditional, as in (28), which is not supposed to have\nthe interpretation in (28\u2032).\n\n\n(28) If every person I know is happy then I will be happy.\n\n(28\u2032) *[every x: person(x) and\nknow(I,x)](if x is happy then I will be happy)\n\n\nBut a \u201cwide understanding\u201d of (29) does seem to be\npossible.\n\n\n(29) If a person I know is happy then I will be happy.\n\n(29\u2032) [An x: person(x) and\nknow(I,x)](if x is happy then I will be happy)\n\n\nThe moral was supposed to be that these \u201cwide\u201d readings\nare not the reflex of wide scope quantification (that would be to make\nindefinite descriptions syntactically special), but rather due to the\nfact that the indefinites in these examples are referring\nexpressions.\n\nThe Fodor and Sag argumentation was taken up in the philosophical\nliterature by King (1988) and Ludlow and Neale (1991), who argued that\nthere is a confusion in the Fodor and Sag discussion. Kripke\u2019s\nclaim, of course, was that referential uses of a description are a\nfunction of pragmatics, not quantifier scope. Nor, of course, could a\nreferential use be associated with wide scope, as Kripke (1977) argued\nforcefully\u2014they simply are not the same phenomenon. The problem\nis that the Fodor and Sag arguments do not address the pragmatic\naccount of referential uses, which of course was the alternative\nadvanced by Kripke.\n\nIn addition, there do appear to be more quantifier scope possibilities\nthan the Fodor and Sag proposal seems to allow. Consider (30), from\nLudlow and Neale and (31) from Kripke.\n\n\n(30) Each teacher overheard many exclamations that a student of mine\ncheated.\n\n(31) Hoover charged that the Berrigans plotted to kidnap a high\nAmerican official.\n\n\nIn the case of (30) \u2018a student of mine\u2019 can have narrow\nscope with respect to \u2018every teacher\u2019 but wide scope with\nrespect to \u2018many exclamations\u2019. Similarly, as Kripke\n(1977) observed, intermediate scope is possible in (24) (as when the\nBerrigans have someone in mind, but Hoover does not know who). Similar\nobservations about the possibility of intermediate scope have been\nmade by Farkas (1981), Rooth and Partee (1982), King (1988), Ruys\n(1992) and Abusch (1994). How are Fodor and Sag supposed to generate\nreadings like that, given only a referential/quantificational\nambiguity and no relative scope relations? As Kripke put the point,\n\u201cno two-fold distinction can replace Russell\u2019s notion of\nscope.\u201d While this tells against referential analysis of\nindefinites, it opens a can of worms for the other approaches as well;\nfor example, if indefinite descriptions are ordinary quantified\nexpressions, then why do they have such extraordinary island-escaping\nproperties (or at least appear to)?\n\nOne attractive possibility that has emerged from the literature in\nDiscourse Representation Theory\u2014in particular in work by Heim\n(1982), Kamp (1984), Deising (1992), Kamp and Reyle (1993)\u2014has\nbeen that the appearance of a determiner in an indefinite description\nis chimeral\u2014\u2018a man\u2019 in fact comes to an expression\ncontaining a predicate and a free variable, as in \u2018man\nx\u2019. This free variable might then be picked up by some\nsort of discourse operator as discussed in the previous section.\n\nAccordingly, a sentence like (1) might have a logical form, or better,\na discourse representation structure akin to (1*) (abstracting from\ndetails).\n\n(1*) [[man(x) came in the room] [x turned on the\nTV]]\n\n\nThis general strategy gives us some explanation for why indefinites\nsometimes appear to have island escaping properties as in cases like\nconditionals. The answer is that they don\u2019t escape at all, but\nare free variables that are bound by (or existentially closed by)\noperators outside of the island. This describes the DRT strategy only\nin the most general of terms, but we can already see that the\nquestions that plague the Russellian story have their reflex here as\nwell. Everyone now recognizes that intermediate scope is a possibility\nin cases like (30) and (31), but the question is just what mechanisms\nmake it possible? The Russellian has to opt for operators with unusual\nisland escaping properties. What is the DRT theorist to do?\n\nOne option, explored by Reinhart (1996), Kratzer (1995), and Winter\n(1997), employs the device of choice functions. As Winter informally\ncharacterizes the doctrine, the idea is as follows.\n\n\n(A1) Indefinites lack quantificational force of their own\n\n(A2) An indefinite NP in an argument position, however, ends up\ndenoting an individual, because the semantics involves a free function\nvariable that assigns an individual to the restriction predicate.\n\n(A3) This function variable is existentially closed, together with the\nrestriction that it is a choice function: a function that chooses a\nmember from any non-empty predicate it gets.\n\n\nHow does this help in the case of intermediate scope? For Reinhart\n(1996), choice functions by themselves cannot account for the extant\nphenomena (in particular cases of intermediate scope), so the theory\nmust be supplemented with standard quantifier raising accounts as\nwell. Winter (1997) has offered a more general account employing\nchoice functions (also extending the account to plural indefinites)\nthat purport to make do without the additional resource of quantifier\nraising.\n\nThe interesting conceptual issue that arises, whether we opt for\nstandard DRT accounts or such accounts supplemented with choice\nfunctions, is whether this departs from the Russellian analysis of\nindefinite descriptions in important ways. In one respect, of course,\nthe accounts are very different\u2014Russell takes indefinite\ndescriptions to be existential quantifiers, while the DRT accounts\ntake them to be akin to free variables. On the other hand, once the\nfree variables are interpreted the effect comes to very much the same\nthing: in both cases the accounts are fundamentally\nquantificational.\n\nNot everyone has seen DRT theory and choice functions in this light.\nKratzer (1995) maintained that the choice function provided something\nlike a referential interpretation of an indefinite, here understood as\na \u201cpointing gesture within the mind of the speaker,\u201d but\nas Winter points out this raises some difficult methodological issues,\nand in the view of Ludlow and Neale (1991) this amounts to a\nconflation of the notions of referentiality and specificity, and a\nfurther confusion about the nature of specificity. On their view,\nusing an expression with a particular individual in mind is not the\nsame thing as referring to that individual. For example, according to\nLudlow and Neale, there are a number of possible uses to which we can\nput indefinite descriptions, including referential uses, specific\nuses, definite uses, and purely existential uses. To understand this\ndistinction, consider the following cases.\n\n\n\nReferential use. A teacher announces the following to the\nclass, with a single red haired student in the front row.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to name names, but I have good reason to\nbelieve that red haired student in the front row cheated on\nyesterday\u2019s exam.\u201d In this case the teacher has singular\ngrounds for the utterance, and is communicating directly to the\naudience the identity of the individual that serves as the grounds for\nthe utterance. \n\n\nSpecific use. In this case the teacher has singular grounds,\nand wishes to communicate that fact to the audience, but does not wish\nto communicate the identity of the cheater to the class.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to announce that yesterday I witnessed a\nstudent cheating on the exam.\u201d \n\n\nDefinite use: In this case the teacher knows that there must\nhave been a unique cheater, but does not know the identity of the\ncheater and hence does not have singular grounds for the utterance and\naccordingly is not in a position to communicate the identity of the\ncheater except under extraordinary circumstances. \u201cI have\nstatistical evidence that a student cheated on the exam. Fortunately\nthere only appears to be one cheater.\u201d \n\n\nPurely quantificational use: In this instance not only does\nthe teacher fail to know the identity of the cheater, but also fails\nto know whether or not there was a unique cheater (perhaps there were\nseveral). \u201cI have evidence that a student cheated on the exam.\nThe answer sheet was stolen from my office. Hopefully, there was only\none student involved. We will know more pending an\ninvestigation.\u201d \n\n\nAccording to Ludlow and Neale, it is implausible to think that all of\nthese uses can be chalked up to semantic facts. In each case, the\nproposition expressed is argued to be that which would be expressed if\nthe indefinite determiner were replaced by the existential quantifier.\nThe different uses of descriptions then stem from the application of\nGricean principles of conversational implicature to what was literally\nsaid.\n4.4 Plural, mass, and generic descriptions\n\nSo far we have discussed singular definite and indefinite descriptions\n(and the possibility that names are descriptions) but as it turns out\nthese types of descriptions are probably not the most commonly\noccurring descriptions in English. Ultimately we also want to take\ninto account plural descriptions (as in \u2018the dogs are\nbarking\u2019), mass noun descriptions (as in \u2018the water is\ncold\u2019), and generics (as in \u2018the dog is a loyal\nfriend\u2019). The question is whether each of these constructions\nmust be treated in a different way, or whether it is possible to unify\ntheir treatment with the analysis of definite descriptions discussed\nabove. Sharvy (1980) suggested that a unified treatment is indeed\npossible (this is also a possibility that Chomsky (1975) saw).\n\nSharvy\u2019s idea was that we could generalize Russell\u2019s\ntheory of descriptions by \u2018the F (or Fs) is\n(are) G\u2019 to be equivalent to the following,\n\n(32) \u2203x(Fx &\n\u2200y(Fy \u2192 y \u2264 x)\n& Gx)\n\n\nwhere F can be either a singular count noun (like\n\u2018dog\u2019), a plural count noun (like \u2018dogs\u2019) or a\nmass noun (like \u2018water\u2019), and the symbol\n\u2018\u2264\u2019 indicates a parthood relation. Following Brogaard\n(2007) we can take this as saying \u2018an F that every\nF is part of satisfies \u201cG\u201d\u2019. It\nfollows then, that a definite description \u2018the F\u2019\n(\u2018the Fs\u2019) denotes the maximal sum or mass in the\nextension of F. So, for example, when we utter \u2018The\ndogs\u2019 we are denoting the maximal set of dogs in the domain of\ndiscourse. When we utter \u2018the water\u2019, we are denoting the\nmaximal mass of water in the discourse. In the case of singular\ndefinite descriptions (like \u2018the dog\u2019) we are still\ndenoting the maximal set of dogs in the domain of discourse (since in\nthis case there is only one dog). In effect, singular definite\ndescriptions are just special cases of Sharvy\u2019s generalized\ntheory of descriptions.\n\nFara (2001) argued that the same strategy can be extended to generics\nas well.\n\n(33) The dog is related to the wolf.\n\n\nIf natural kinds like species and sub-species can bear the parthood\nrelation to one another, then one can extend the Sharvy parthood\noperator to these cases as well. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that\nSharvy\u2019s analysis of these constructions has no competitors, but\nthe fact that he was able to give a unified treatment of these\nconstructions suggests that competitors will have to do the same. It\nreally does seem as though singular, plural, mass, and generic\ndescriptions are not so different in kind. A unified Russellian\ntreatment of the constructions seems possible. In section 7 we will\nreturn to the question of whether the maximality claim should be part\nof the analysis or whether it represents a weakness in the\nanalysis.\n5. Objections to the Theory of Descriptions\n\nThe theory of descriptions has encountered its fair share of\ncriticism. This criticism has ranged from contentions that Russell\nsimply got the truth conditions wrong in important cases to nagging\nworries about the details of the proposal\u2014in particular worries\nrelating to the nature of the descriptive content. As we will see,\nnone of these concerns have been completely ameliorated.\n5.1 The challenge to Russell\u2019s truth conditions\n\nStrawson (1950) objected that Russell\u2019s theory is simply\nincorrect about the truth conditions of sentences like \u2018The\npresent king of France is bald\u2019. According to Russell\u2019s\nanalysis, this sentence is false (since it contains an existence claim\nto the effect that there is a present king of France), but according\nto Strawson, this does not conform to our intuitions about the truth\nof an utterance of that sentence. In Strawson\u2019s view, an\nutterance of the sentence in a world where there is no present king of\nFrance is neither true nor false; perhaps the sentence has a truth\nvalue gap, or perhaps it fails to express a determinate proposition\n(Strawson vacillated on this), but either way it does not appear to be\nfalse. Strawson held that this fact supported a referential\ninterpretation of expressions like \u2018The present king of\nFrance\u2019.\n\nIf there is no present king of France, then an utterance containing\nsuch an expression is somehow defective. It is as if I looked into my\ndesk drawer, not allowing you to see what I was looking at, and said\n\u2018that is a fine green one.\u2019 Strawson held that utterances\nlike these do not entail the existence of a fine green one or the\npresent King of France, but rather presuppose their\nexistence. If the expressions fail to refer, then there is a\npresupposition failure and the utterance fails to have a determinate\ntruth value. (Notice that this sort of failure is not supposed to\nundermine the meaningfulness of the sentences that we utter; for\nStrawson, sentences are meaningful in and of themselves, independently\nof the utterance situation. Utterances of meaningful sentences may be\ntrue or false or, if here is a presupposition failure, they may be\nneither.)\n\nFor his part, Russell (1957) argued that, despite Strawson\u2019s\nprotestations, the sentence was in fact false:\n\nSuppose, for example, that in some country there was a law that no\nperson could hold public office if he considered it false that the\nRuler of the Universe is wise. I think an avowed atheist who took\nadvantage of Mr. Strawson\u2019s doctrine to say that he did not hold\nthis proposition false would be regarded as a somewhat shifty\ncharacter.\n\n\nDoes this whole debate come down to a case of intuition swapping?\nThomason (1990; 327) and Soames (1976; 169) seemed to think so, and\nStrawson himself (1964) also came to doubt whether the entailment vs.\npresupposition debate could be settled by \u201cbrisk little formal\nargument[s]\u201d. However, Neale (1990) maintained that the matter\ncould be settled in Russell\u2019s favor, and supported the claim by\ncollecting a number of previously observed cases in which intuitions\nabout truth conditions clearly do not support Strawson\u2019s view.\nFor example, \u2018My mother is dating the present king of\nFrance\u2019 seems clearly false, as does \u2018The present king of\nFrance cleans my swimming pool\u2019, and he concluded that these are\nclearly cases where the Strawsonian truth conditions have gone\nawry.\n\nBut truth value judgments for cases like this are extremely sensitive.\nLasersohn (1993), von Fintel (2004), Yablo (2006, 2009) and Schoubye\n(2009, 2011) have collected a number of examples where subtle changes\nto the example give rise to different judgments of truth value.\nConsider the following minimal pairs, where the examples marked with\n\u2018#\u2019 indicate ambivalence about assigning a truth value,\nand \u2018F\u2019 indicates it is more plausible to assign a value\nof falsehood.\n\n\n\n\n(34)\na.\n# The present king of France is bald. \n\n\u00a0\nb.\nF The present king of France is a bald Nazi. \n\n(35)\na.\n# The present king of France is sitting in a chair. \n\n\u00a0\nb.\nF The present king of France is sitting that chair. \n\n(36)\na.\n# The present king of France read Anna Karenina.\n\n\n\u00a0\nb.\nF The present king of France wrote Anna Karenina.\n\n\n(37)\na.\n# The present king of France heard about Goldbach\u2019s\nconjecture. \n\n\u00a0\nb.\nF The present king of France proved Goldbach\u2019s\nconjecture.  \n\n\n\nVon Fintel and Yablo offer an explanation for these minimal pairs that\ndraws upon the nature of belief revision. Their idea is that the false\npresupposition is added to the evaluator\u2019s set of beliefs and is\ntested against that set of beliefs. So, if we test \u2018The king of\nFrance read Anna Karenina\u2019 against a typical set of beliefs,\nthere is no clash with existing beliefs. But if we test \u2018The\nking of France wrote Anna Karenina\u2019 against this set of\nbeliefs, we get a clash. These are the cases where we judge the\nsentence false.\n\nSchoubye (2009, 2011) has argued that the von Fintel/Yablo story fails\nin key places, in particular with cases where there is no previously\nexisting conflicting belief. We typically believe that Anna\nKarenina was written by Tolstoy, who was not and is not the king\nof France, but do we really have a belief in which the king of France\nwas not a bald Nazi? Where would that belief come from? A general\nbelief that royals can\u2019t be Nazis? That seems implausible.\n\nMore significantly, Schoubye observes that with some modest contextual\nframing the truth value judgments on these examples can flip. In other\nwords, we don\u2019t even need to change the example sentences.\nSuppose, for example, that someone says that all the royalty at a\nparty are standing and someone utters \u2018The present king of\nFrance is sitting in a chair\u2019. Here Schoubye suggests that our\ntruth value judgments firm up and flip from being indeterminate to\nbeing clear judgments of falsity.\n\nSchoubye\u2019s positive proposal is that the divergent judgments\nabout truth conditions key off of whether a speaker\u2019s utterance\ncan be interpreted as being cooperative. Here Schoubye draws on\nRobert\u2019s (1998, 2004) idea of the \u201ctopic under\ndiscussion.\u201d In the example just given, where we are talking\nabout who is sitting at a particular party, someone who utters (35a)\nis being an uncooperative discourse partner, in that they are not\naddressing the topic under discussion.\n\nThe literature on presuppositional accounts of definite descriptions\nhas become vast, although not entirely uniform in its criticism of\nRussellian doctrine. Earlier, we noted that on Russell\u2019s view\ndefinite descriptions pack within them an existence claim, a\nuniqueness claim, and a maximality claim. Different presuppositional\naccounts have targeted different parts of this package, arguing that\nthe relevant component is not entailed but is presupposed.\n\nFor example, beginning with Strawson and the work cited above, we have\nnumerous writers arguing that the existence claim is presupposed. The\nidea that uniqueness is presupposed is suggested in work by Heim\n(1991), von Fintel (2004), Elbourne (2005, 2013), Rothschild (2007),\nand Schoubye (2013). It is possible to understand Cooper (1983), Heim\n(1983), Chemla (2009), Schlenker (2008, 2009) and Romoli (2015) as\nholding that the maximality component is presupposed. Combinations are\npossible. The idea that both the existence claim and the uniqueness\nclaim is presupposed can be attributed to Abbott (2008), Hawthorne and\nManley (2012) and Schoubye (2013), among others.\u00a0 For a detailed\ndefense of the Strawsonian position, see Elbourne (2013).\n5.2 Donnellan\u2019s distinction and the argument from misdescription\n\nDonnellan (1966) observed that there is a sense in which Strawson and\nRussell are both right (and both wrong) about the proper analysis of\ndescriptions. He argued that definite descriptions can be used in (at\nleast) two different ways. On a so-called attributive use, a sentence\nof the form \u2018The F is G\u2019 is used to\nexpress a proposition equivalent to \u2018Whatever is uniquely\nF is G\u2019. For example, on seeing murder victim\nSmith\u2019s badly mutilated corpse, Detective Brown might say\n\u201cThe murderer of Smith is insane\u201d thereby communicating\nthe thought that some unique individual murdered Smith and that\nwhoever that individual is, he/she is insane. Alternatively, on a\nreferential use, a sentence of the form \u2018The F is\nG\u2019 is used to pick out a specific individual,\nx, and say of x that x is G. For\nexample, suppose Jones is on trial for Smith\u2019s murder and is\nbehaving quite strangely at the defense table. I point at Jones and\nsay, \u201cThe murderer of Smith is insane\u201d, thereby\ncommunicating the thought that Jones is insane (whether or not Jones\nis the actual murderer).\n\nDonnellan suggested that Russell\u2019s quantificational account of\ndefinite descriptions might capture attributive uses, but that it does\nnot work for referential uses. In effect, we might take Donnellan as\nsaying that in some cases descriptions are Russellian and in some\ncases they are Strawsonian. Perhaps we could even say that the\ndefinite determiner \u2018the\u2019 is ambiguous between these two\ncases (it is not clear whether Donnellan himself intended to endorse a\nlexical ambiguity of this sort).\n\nKripke (1977) responded to Donnellan by arguing that the Russellian\naccount of definite descriptions could, by itself, account for both\nreferential and attributive uses; the difference between the two cases\ncould be entirely a matter of pragmatics. Here is the idea: Grice\nshowed us that there is an important distinction to be made between\nwhat one literally says by an utterance and what one intends to\ncommunicate (what one means) by that utterance. To take a famous\nexample of Grice\u2019s, I might write a letter of recommendation for\na student saying that he is very punctual and has excellent\nhandwriting. Now what I have said is something about the\nstudent\u2019s punctuality and handwriting, but what I meant was that\nthis is a very weak student.\n\nIn a similar vein, we could say that when I use a description\nreferentially\u2014say in Donnellan\u2019s courtroom case\u2014I am\nliterally making a general claim to the effect that there is a\nmurderer of Smith and that he is insane, but what I mean by that\nutterance is that Jones is insane. That is, when I say \u2018The\nmurderer of Smith insane\u2019 what I literally say is that exactly\none person, x, is such that x murdered Smith and\nx is insane, but in that context I would succeed in\ncommunicating the singular proposition (about Jones) that Jones is\ninsane. Kripke gave several reasons for thinking that this Gricean\nsolution was preferable to an ambiguity thesis. One reason was a\ngeneral methodological point that one should not introduce ambiguities\nblithely\u2014doing so is a kind of philosophical cheat.\n\nAlso, Kripke observed that these two uses of definite descriptions are\nreally just subspecies of the general distinction between what is\nmeant (speaker\u2019s reference in Kripke\u2019s terminology) and\nwhat is literally said (semantic reference) and not at all unique to\ndescriptions. Kripke noted that the distinction even applies to uses\nof proper names. So, for example, consider the case where I see a man\nin the distance raking leaves. I take the man to be Jones but it is\nactually Johnson. I say \u2018Jones is really working up a sweat\ntoday\u2019. Now what I have literally said is that Jones is working\nup a sweat, but what I have communicated (what I meant) is something\nabout Johnson. Clearly no one would argue that the name\n\u2018Jones\u2019 is ambiguous between referring to Jones and\nreferring to Johnson, so why opt for an ambiguity thesis when\ndescriptions are involved? It appears to be exactly the same\nphenomenon.\n\nOne of the advantages of employing the Gricean distinction between the\nproposition literally communicated and the proposition meant is that\nit offers an account for our being ambivalent about Donnellan\u2019s\n(1966) misdescription cases. In the courtroom case discussed above, I\nmight say \u201cSmith\u2019s murderer is insane,\u201d and still\nsay something true even if the crazy man at the defense table is\nentirely innocent of the charges and the actual murderer, who is miles\nfrom the courtroom, is quite sane. At the same time there is some pull\nto say that in such a case one is saying something false too. We can\nsay that this is a case where what we literally said was false, but\nthat what we intended to communicate\u2014the proposition\nmeant\u2014was true. The two-level theory thus accounts for our\nconflicting intuitions.\n\nSimilarly, Hornsby (1977) gave the case of my observing the man\nranting at the defense table and (me) saying, \u201cThe murderer of\nSmith is insane\u201d not realizing that the man at the table is both\ninnocent and quite sane, while the actual murderer is at large and\nquite insane. Again we are ambivalent about the truth of what I say,\nand as Neale (1990; 91\u201393) observed, the distinction between the\nproposition literally expressed and the proposition meant allows us to\nunderstand why. In this case, the proposition literally expressed is\ntrue, but what I intend to communicate is mistaken.\n\nUnfortunately, there are cases where the two-stage theory\ndoesn\u2019t appear to be sufficient. For example, there remains a\ndifficulty that Ludlow and Segal (2004) have called the residue of\nthe problem of misdescription. Consider a case where we are at\nthe crime scene, and unbeknownst to Detective Brown there is not one\nmurderer but several\u2014suppose there were several perpetrators and\nthey were all mad members of an evil cult. When Brown utters the\nsentence \u2018The murderer of Smith is insane\u2019 has he said\nsomething true or false? Again we are in two minds about the matter\nbut this time the distinction between what is literally said and what\nis meant is no help.\n5.3 The argument from incompleteness\n\nAnother persistent problem for the classical Russellian theory of\ndescriptions has been the charge that it fails to account for the\nproblem of \u201cincomplete descriptions\u201d (for discussion see\nDonnellan (1968), Hornsby (1977), Devitt (1981, chapter 2; 2004),\nWettstein (1981), Recanati (1986), Salmon (1982), Soames (1986), Neale\n(1990; chapter 2), and Reimer (1992)). In addition, Kripke (1977),\nwhile defending Russell\u2019s theory of description against the\nproblem of misdescription, allows that the argument from incomplete\ndescriptions might be enough of a problem to force us to accept\nreferential interpretations of descriptions. The worry, initially\nraised in Strawson (1950), is that if I say \u2018the table is\ncovered with books\u2019, I do not mean to be suggesting that there\nis only one table in the world. Unfortunately, that seems to be\nprecisely what the Russellian theory of descriptions is committed to.\n(Recall that on the Russellian analysis my utterance is shorthand for\n\u2018there is a table and only one table and every table is covered\nwith books\u2019.)\n\nOne strategy for dealing with this problem is that the context may\nprovide us the means to flesh out the description. For example,\nperhaps descriptions can be fleshed out appropriately if we allow\nimplicit spatiotemporal locating expressions to be inserted into the\ndescription. The suggestion is that when we speak of the table we are\nimplicitly specifying a spatial coordinate\u2014in effect, we are\nsaying \u2018the table over there\u2019. One problem with strategies\nof this nature is that there fails to be a principled basis (in the\nterminology of Devitt and Sterelny (1999)) for determining what the\ncontent of these descriptions is to be. Is it to be a description that\nthe speaker has in mind? Is this description really sufficient to\nuniquely identify the object in question? Is it always clear that the\nspeaker has a description in mind?\n\nNeale (1990) has argued that whatever we may want to say about the\nproblem of incompleteness, it is not very effective as an argument for\nthe referential analysis of descriptions. For example, at the crime\nscene Detective Brown may simply utter \u2018The murderer is\ninsane\u2019 failing to specify exactly which murderer he is talking\nabout (is it the murderer of Smith or Jones or \u2026?). But by\nhypothesis this case is a canonical example of an attributive use of a\ndefinite description. No reference is possible, so how can appeal to\nreference bail us out? How can any of this be an argument for definite\ndescriptions being semantically referential?\n\nEven stronger, it appears that there are numerous examples involving\nquantified expressions that suffer the same fate as incomplete\ndescriptions. I can say \u2018Everyone came to the party\u2019, not\nintending to mean everyone in the world. Or I might say, as Yogi Berra\nonce did, \u2018Nobody goes there anymore, it\u2019s too\ncrowded\u2019. It certainly appears that what is going on in these\ncases is similar to the cases of incomplete definite descriptions and\nthat there should be a single strategy for accounting for these\ndifferent cases of \u201cincompleteness.\u201d\n\nDevitt (2004, 2007) and Reimer (1998) have argued that these cases are\ngenuinely different in kind. Their idea is that since definite\ndescriptions are regularly used to express singular thoughts, it\nstands to reason that the standard meaning of the definite description\nmust be referential. Schoubye (2011, ch. 3) has responded to this\nclaim arguing that it rests on mistaken assumptions about semantic\nprocessing and that in any case the line of reasoning would generalize\nso as to force a referential interpretation of most (possibly all) the\nother determiners (e.g. \u2018every\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019).\n\nAlternatively, some writers have argued that that the problem of\nincomplete definite descriptions can be accounted for if we pursue an\nappropriate theory of quantifier domain restriction. Stanley and\nSzab\u00f3 (2000), for example, take this approach, suggesting that\ncontext can restrict the domain of quantification. On their proposal,\ncontext can even shift within a sentence, allowing us to make sense of\nan utterance like \u2018The dogs barked at the dogs\u2019, where I\nmean to say that one group of dogs barked while the other group\nperhaps suffered in silence. (Their proposal is applicable to all\nquantified expressions; not just the theory of descriptions. See Bach\n(2000), Neale (2000b), and Lepore (2004) for a more general discussion\nof the proposal.)\n\nIt is important to note (following Szab\u00f3 (2000) and Ludlow and\nSegal (2004) that even with a fully functional account of quantifier\ndomain restriction there is a lingering problem here too. Let\u2019s\ncall it the residue of the incompleteness problem. Consider\ncases like (38)\n\n(38) I put the book on the book.\n\n\nOn the domain restriction proposal, the first use of \u2018the\nbook\u2019 cannot have the same domain of quantification as the\nsecond use, since that would put two books in the domain of\nquantification and it would mean that both descriptions in the\nsentence are incomplete. But one wonders how legitimate a domain-shift\nanalysis is here. Is there really a shift in the domain of\nquantification between the first utterance of \u2018the book\u2019\nand the second utterance of that noun phrase? What would count as\nindependent evidence either for, or against, a domain-shift taking\nplace?\n6. Dissolving Descriptions\n\nAs noted in the beginning of this article, the Russellian account of\ndescriptions not only offers a quantificational as opposed to a\nreferential account of descriptions, but it packs three different\nclaims into the analysis of descriptions: an existence claim,\na uniqueness claim, and a maximality claim. As we\nwill see, all of these claims can be put under pressure, and all three\narguably collapse under that pressure. Let\u2019s begin by examining\nthe uniqueness claim.\n6.1 Rejecting the uniqueness claim\n\nGiven the Gricean resources discussed above, one might speculate that\nthe distinction between definite and indefinite descriptions can be\ncollapsed\u2014that is, perhaps \u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019\nhave the same literal meaning and the only relevant distinction\nbetween them is pragmatic.\n\nThe motivation for this idea would be as follows. Very few natural\nlanguages have what we would recognize as definite and indefinite\ndescriptions. In most Asian and Slavic languages, for example,\n\u2018the man\u2019 and \u2018a man\u2019 would both be expressed\nin the same way\u2014in the determiner-free equivalent of\n\u2018man\u2019. Perhaps it is just our infatuation with surface\ngrammatical form that leads us to think that English or Italian really\nhas two different logical elements corresponding to surface forms\n\u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019. Perhaps there is a single\nlogical element (or perhaps just a free variable) with different\npragmatic application conditions. That is, perhaps \u2018the\u2019\nand \u2018a\u2019 have the same literal meaning\u2014i.e., for both\n\u2018An F is G\u2019 and \u2018The F is\nG\u2019 the literal semantics is exhausted by the\ninterpretation that [\u2203x: Fx](Gx)\nreceives in a standard truth-conditional semantics. A number of\nlinguists and philosophers have entertained this idea in recent years,\nincluding Kempson (1975), Breheney (1999), Szab\u00f3 (2000),\nZvolensky (1997), Ludlow and Segal (2003) and a version of the idea is\nat least considered in Heim (1982) and Kamp and Reyle (1993).\n\nObviously there are important differences between our application of\nthe terms \u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019, but it does not\nfollow that these differences in application are part of their\nsemantical content. Indeed, many synonyms customarily are put to\ndifferent uses. Take, for example, Grice (1961, 1975) on the\ndistinction between \u2018but\u2019 and \u2018and\u2019. On\nGrice\u2019s story \u2018but\u2019 and \u2018and\u2019 literally\nmean the same thing, but different \u201cconventional\nimplicatures\u201d are associated with them; \u2018but\u2019\nimplicates a sense of contrast between the conjuncts.\n\nLudlow and Segal (2004) offer a similar story about \u2018a\u2019\nand \u2018the\u2019. Following a standard assumption in traditional\ngrammar (see Christophersen 1929), they argue that \u2018the\u2019\nsignals that the object under discussion is given in the\nconversational context. Noun phrases fronted by the determiner\n\u2018a\u2019 signal that they involve new information. The idea\nadvanced by Ludlow and Segal, however, is that this slender bit of\ninformation, combined with Gricean principles, is sufficient to\ngenerate the uniqueness implication that is carried by a definite\ndescription. That is, an existential claim that there is an F\nthat is G, plus a signal that this is given information, is often\nenough to allow us to implicate that there is unique F that\nis G.\n\nArmed with this idea, let\u2019s return to the some of the loose\nthreads that we left hanging in section 4 above\u2014the residue of\nthe misdescription problem and the residue of the incompleteness\nproblem. As we will see, the unified treatment of definite and\nindefinite descriptions may provide us an entering wedge for cracking\nopen these puzzles. Let\u2019s look at the misdescription case\nfirst.\n6.1.1 The residue of the problem of misdescription\n\nRecall the case in which Detective Brown says \u2018the murderer of\nSmith is insane\u2019, incorrectly believing that there was one\nmurderer when in fact the crime was committed by a ghoulish cult of\ninsane individuals. There is a sense in which Brown spoke falsely, but\nthere is also clearly some pull for us to say that what he said was\ntrue. As we saw in section 4, the distinction between the proposition\nliterally expressed and the proposition meant was not sufficient to\naccount for this ambivalence on our part. But according to Ludlow and\nSegal (2004), if we combine this pragmatic distinction with the\nunified analysis of definite and indefinite descriptions there is\nsomething we can say about this last bit of residue.\n\nAccording to the unified analysis of descriptions, what Detective\nBrown literally expresses is not the idea that there was a unique\nmurderer of Smith who is insane. To the contrary, he literally\nexpresses the proposition that there is at least one murderer of Smith\nwho is insane. By applying Gricean principles in this context we have\nmade out that Brown intends to say that there is a unique murderer of\nSmith and that he is insane. We are pulled in two directions by this\ncase because what Brown has said is literally true but what he\nintended to communicate was, strictly speaking, false.\n6.1.2 The residue of the problem of uniqueness\n\nIn section 5.3 we considered cases like (38), repeated here, which did\nnot seem to yield in a natural way to the device of quantifier domain\nrestriction.\n\n(38) I put the book on the book.\n\n\nBut as Szab\u00f3 (2000) and Ludlow and Segal (2003) have argued, if\nwe combine quantifier domain restriction with the unified analysis of\ndescriptions, the problem seems more amenable to solution. The idea is\nthe following: What one literally expresses in (38) is that the\nspeaker put a book on a book. Pragmatics helps us to make out that one\nbook in particular is being spoken of, which book that is, and where\nit is to be moved.\n6.2 Criticism of the Unified View\n\nAlthough a unified approach is attractive, it has come under criticism\nfrom Abbott (2003, 2008), Horn (2006) and Abbott and Horn (2011). For\nexample, Abbott (2008) argues that the pragmatic story (in which the\nuniqueness of some descriptions is conversationally implicated) fails\nbecause it predicts that the uniqueness implication should be\ncancellable, but according to Abbott, it is not. (Here we use the hash\nsymbol to indicate a failed implicature cancellation.)\n\n(39) # Russell was the author of Principia Mathematica, in fact there\nwere two.\n\n\nOne response to this line of argument is that it frontloads our\nassumptions about written works having single authors. Is (40) any\nbetter?\n\n(40) # Russell authored Principia Mathematica, in fact someone else\ndid too.\n\n\nThis suggests that the uniqueness is not implicated by\n\u2018the\u2019, but is rather built into the meaning of\n\u2018authored\u2019. Strictly speaking, Russell isn\u2019t an\nauthor, but a co-author. Contrast both with the following, which seems\nentirely natural.\n\n(41) John went to the doctor about his condition, in fact, he went to\ntwo doctors because he wanted a second opinion.\n\n\nThis also raises the question of how far one can press the case based\non examples like (39). Should we also reject Kripke\u2019s pragmatic\nanalysis of referential descriptions because of the infelicity of\nexamples like (42)?\n\n(42) (pointing at person in witness chair) # The murderer of Smith is\ninsane, but I don\u2019t know who it is.\n\n\nAbbott and Horn have suggested that the use of stress in descriptions\nhighlights the uniqueness implications of the utterance. In\nparticular, they claim that in the case of focal stress on the\ndefinite, \u201conly uniqueness is at issue with focused\nthe, never familiarity.\u201d\n\nConsider the following examples from Horn (2006).\n\n\n(43) Graham claims that cancer selection is not a\nbut the driving force in the emergence of complex\nanimal life.\n\n(44) an idea that the EU is not A but\nTHE form of regional integration.\n\n(45) Yet time and again, North Korea is cited as not only\n\u201ca\u201d but \u201cthe\u201d major threat to US\nsecurity.\n\n(46) So Lufthansa is a\u2014or even the\u2014German\nairline.\n\n\nSetting aside the question of whether these examples offer a case\nagainst familiarity, they are not, by themselves, evidence for\nuniqueness. For example, if (46) is asserting that there is a single\nunique German airline, it is clearly false, as there are many other\nGerman airlines, including Germanwings, Air Berlin, Germania, Hahn\nAir, and Air Hamburg. Abbot (1999, 2008) recognizes that cases like\nthis are false, but argues that what is going on is that the speakers\nare engaged in hyperbole. That is, in (46) the speaker is literally\nsaying there is only one German airline and we recognize this as an\nintentional falsehood, and then infer that the speaker means to\ncommunicate the airline is special in some way. The alternative, of\ncourse, is to hold that the stressed definite determiner is indicating\nfamiliarity or salience. It is also worth noting that Schwarz (2009)\nobserves there are languages in which separate determiners are used to\nexpress familiarity and uniqueness. (See also Coppock forthcoming for\ndiscussion of this point.)\n\nUniqueness accounts also must account for cases in which uniqueness\nappears to vanish altogether. Consider (47).\n\n(47) I was driving down the highway, when I lost control of\nmy car and it went into the ditch. I hit my head on the\nside window of the car. The ambulance came and took me\nto the hospital where I had to wait an hour for the\ndoctor to see me. I went home in a taxi.\n\n\nIn a similar vein it is hard to overlook the fact that possessives in\nlanguages like Italian typically deploy definite determiners\n(\u2018la mia machina\u2019) without forcing the reading\nthat I own only one car.\n\nCases of this nature have of course been familiar for some time, but\nperhaps it has been less on the radar that the uniqueness proposal\ncreates foundational problems for language acquisition theory. It is\nsomething of a basic working hypothesis of acquisition theory that\nsemantical components of language are acquired very early and that\npragmatic components are acquired much later (see Chien and Wexler\n(1990), Thornton and Wexler (2000)). This is not surprising, given\nthat pragmatics can involve sophisticated real world reasoning.\nHowever, children\u2019s grasp of definite and indefinite\ndescriptions come late in the acquisition process (around age 9; see\nKarmiloff-Smith 1979 and Warden 1976)), prompting Wexler (2011),\nworking on hypothesis that descriptions are Russellian, to question\nthe working hypothesis that semantics is fixed early. But an\nalternative explanation is that uniqueness is a pragmatic phenomenon,\nthus saving the working hypothesis. In other words, a basic working\nhypothesis of acquisition theory is preserved if we reject the\nRussellian story about the distinction between definite and indefinite\ndeterminers.\n\nSo far we have been talking about the unified theory in the context of\nrejecting the uniqueness component of Russell\u2019s analysis. But\nthere are also the existence component and the maximality component to\nconsider. Can these also be rejected?\n6.3 Rejecting the existence claim\n\nA number of authors have observed that the traditional Russellian\nanalysis of definite descriptions gets us into trouble when we embed\ndescriptions into certain environments like propositional attitudes,\nconditionals, and questions (see Heim (1991) Elbourne (2005, 2010,\n2013, forthcoming), Neale (2005), Rothschild (2007), Hawthorne and\nManley (2012) and Schoubye (2011, 2013)). To illustrate the problem,\nconsider the following:\n\n\n(48) John wants the ghost in the attic to stop making so much\nnoise.\n\n(49) John wants that there be exactly one ghost in the attic and that\nit stop making so much noise.\n\n\nOn the standard Russellian analysis, we get something like a claim\nthat John wants that there be a unique ghost in his attic and that it\nstop making so much noise. Let\u2019s set aside the uniqueness claim\nfor the moment and just focus on the existence claim; is it really the\ncase that John wants there to be a ghost in the attic at all? Notice\nthat it won\u2019t do to try and extract the existence claim from the\npropositional attitude environment, for then we get an actual\nexistence claim, which is definitely not what we want.\n\nAs Rothchild (2007) observes, a similar argument can be made for\ndescriptions embedded in questions (here assuming, as did Russell,\nthat possessives are to be analyzed as definite descriptions):\n\n\n(50) Is my child making too much noise?\n\n(51) Is it the case that I have exactly one child and that it is\nmaking too much noise?\n\n\nClearly, the question being put forth in (50) is not concerned with\nfinding out whether or not the questioner has a child. Responding by\nsaying \u2018yes you have a child\u2019 would not be a partial\nanswer to the question.\n\nThe phenomenon also seems to apply to modal adverbs. Consider the case\nwhere I do not know if my upstairs neighbors have a child, but I\nspeculate that they do and that it is making noise. It would be odd\nfor me to offer up an utterance of (52), even though (53) would be\nfine.\n\n\n(52) It is possible that the child of my upstairs neighbors is making\nnoise.\n\n(53) It is possible that there is exactly one child of my upstairs\nneighbors and it is making noise.\n I believe this can point can be made for other modals as\nwell.\n\n\n\n(54) It is necessary that my identical twin has my DNA.\n\n(55) It is necessary that there is exactly one identical twin of me\nand that it have my DNA.\n\n\nElbourne (forthcoming) believes that the problem can even be\nconstructed in cases that are extensional if we quantify into the\ndescription. Consider the following.\n\n\n(56) No boy sold the dog he bought.\n\n(57) No boy bought exactly one dog and sold it.\n\n\nThere are circumstances in which the Russellian gloss in (57) is true,\nbut (56) is not true. For example, the case in which no boys bought\nany dogs.\n\nSchoubye\u2019s (2011) solution to all these cases bears notice. He\nargues that the problem can be avoided if we distinguish between the\nsentence itself, the presupposition, and what is asserted. So, for\nexample, for a sentence like \u2018The F is\nG\u2019 we have the following:\n\n\n\n\nSentence:\nthe F is G \n\nPresupposition:\n\u2203x(Fx &\n\u2200y(Fy \u2192 x=y) &\nGx) \n\nAssertion:\nGx  \n\n\n\nSo, as in the Ludlow and Segal analysis, the uniqueness claim is not\npart of what is asserted. On Schoubye\u2019s proposal, uniqueness is\nnot implicated, but is presupposed. But notice also that in this case\nthe existence claim is also not part of what is asserted. What is\nasserted is simply an open sentence! In some cases, the open sentence\nwill be existentially closed, but in cases like \u2018John wants the\nghost in the attic to be quiet\u2019 there is no existential closure.\nOf course it is possible to ask what it means to assert an open\nsentence, but notice that again we are converging on a view in which\nthe determiners fall out, leaving behind a free variable.\n6.4 The maximality claim under pressure\n\nWe\u2019ve already put the uniqueness and existence claims of\ndescriptions under pressure. Can we do the same with the maximality\nclaim? Here it is difficult to find evidence one way or the other for\nthe case of singular definite descriptions, but earlier we saw that\nthe theory could be generalized \u00e0 la Sharvy,\nto plural descriptions, and in the plural case we could actually probe\nthe question of whether maximality holds.\n\nRecall from section 4.4 that on the Sharvy (1980) analysis of\ndescriptions we could generalize Russell\u2019s theory of\ndescriptions to plurals by arguing that \u2018the F (or\nFs) is (are) G\u2019 is equivalent to the\nfollowing,\n\n(32) \u2203x(Fx &\n\u2200y(Fy \u2192 y\u2264 x) &\nGx)\n\n\n(again, where F can be either a singular count noun (like\n\u2018dog\u2019), a plural count noun (like \u2018dogs\u2019) or a\nmass noun (like \u2018water\u2019), and the symbol\n\u2018\u2264\u2019 indicates a parthood relation.)\n\nOf interest to us at the moment is the fact that this analysis encodes\nthe maximality claim\u2014it says that all the Fs are\nGs. But is this analysis right? Arguably not. If one says the\nAmerican people are disappointed in Trump, it doesn\u2019t mean that\nall of them are. If my neighbor has 101 Dalmatians, I might complain\n\u2018the dogs are barking again\u2019, even if only some of them\nare barking (and it doesn\u2019t seem plausible to say that I am\nrestricting the domain of discourse to just the 20 or so dogs that are\nbarking). Likewise for definite mass terms; if I say that the bread in\nthe breadbox is moldy I am not saying that the bread is moldy through\nand through\u2014I\u2019m saying that some of it is. And if I say\nthat \u2018the dog is a loyal animal\u2019 I am not saying that all\nsubspecies of dogs are loyal. Arguably the maximality condition in\nSharvy\u2019s generalized theory of descriptions should be dropped\naltogether. (But see Brogaard (2007) and Bach (2000) for defenses of\nmaximality.)\n7. Descriptions through\u00a0the Lens of Linguistics\n\nThe importance of descriptions, and what is at stake in metaphysics,\nepistemology etc., have prompted some philosophers to dig deeper into\nthe actual linguistics of descriptions (or better, definite and\nindefinite determiners) and linguists have been happy to join in the\ninvestigation.\u00a0 What those joint investigations have shown is\nthat the structure of descriptions is not as straightforward as\nphilosophers often imagine.\u00a0 There have been several areas where\nthis has become evident.\n7.1 Descriptions as predicates\n\nAt the beginning of this article I noted that some uses of the\nexpressions \u2018an F\u2019 and \u2018the\nF\u2019 are argued to be predicational, rather than\nquantificational. So, for example, consider the following cases.\n\n\n(60) John is a lawyer.\n\n(61) John is the mayor of Pittsburgh.\n\n\nIt is not unusual to think of \u2018is a lawyer\u2019 and \u2018is\nthe mayor of Pittsburgh\u2019 as predicates. In the case of (60), we\nintuitively are not saying that there is a lawyer such that John is\nidentical to that lawyer. Indeed, as Williams (1983) observed, this\nappearance is even more pronounced if we consider cases like (62).\n\n(62) John is not a lawyer\n\n\n(62) does not seem to have the meaning that there is a lawyer such\nthat John is not identical to that lawyer. It is more natural to take\nan utterance of (62) as denying that John has a certain property.\n\nIf this is right, then the copula \u2018is\u2019 is really just the\n\u2018is\u2019 of predication and semantically dispensable\n(significantly, it routinely does not appear in many other languages\nunless it is needed to carry tense or other inflectional information).\nLikewise, we might say that the indefinite article \u2018a\u2019 is\nsemantically inert as well\u2014a mere \u201cgrace note\u201d in\nHigginbotham\u2019s (1987) terminology. In this vein, one widely held\nview, due to Kamp (1981) and Heim (1982), is that we could regard\nindefinite descriptions as expressions containing free variables which\nare bound by adverbs of quantification (in the sense of Lewis (1975))\ninterpreted as existentially quantified by the model theory, or\nperhaps bound by implicit existential closure operators (Diesing\n1992).\n\nFor linguists it is now standard to think of indefinite descriptions\nfollowing the copula as always being predicational, and it is a\nwidespread belief that definite descriptions following the copula are\noften predicational. Philosophers have also been attracted to this\nview. See, for example, Geach (1962; section 39), Wiggins (1965, 42\nff.), Kim (1970; 211 ff.), Wilson (1978), Smiley (1981),\u00a0Heim\n(1982) and Higginbotham (1987) among others). Does it follow that we\nmust admit two different kinds of descriptions (quantificational and\npredicational)? We saw that singular, plural, mass, and generic\ndescriptions can be unified; can we perform the same unification trick\nhere?\n\nFara (2001) pursued the possibility that all uses of definite\ndescriptions are predicational\u2014even descriptions in subject\nposition. The idea is that if I say \u2018The present King of France\nis bald\u2019, I am saying something like the following: some\nx is such that x is the unique present king of\nFrance and x is bald. The interesting riff here is the notion\nthat the uniqueness condition is built into the predicate. Extending\nthe Sharvy (1980) analysis of plural descriptions, we get the\nfollowing, where F is the set of all Fs, or the mass\nof all substance that is F (the vertical strokes before ad\nafter and after the expression indicate that we are talking about the\nsemantic value, or meaning, of the bordered expression):\n\n\n\n\n(63)\n||an F|| = F \n\n\u00a0\n||the F|| = {x: x \u2208 F\n& \u2200y(y\u2208F \u2192\ny\u2264x)}  \n\n\n\nBut again we might consider collapsing the distinction between\ndefinite and indefinite descriptions here, and say that there is a\nsingle rule that interprets all descriptions\u2014definite,\nindefinite, singular, plural, mass, or generic\u2014as predicates.\nWhen we supplement this with the rejection of the\nuniqueness/maximality clause we get this result:\n\n(63\u2032) ||the F/the Fs/an F/some\nFs|| = F\n\n\nIf this is right then the determiners \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018the\u2019 are both \u201cgrace notes\u201d not just in\nspecial positions, but across the board.\n\u00a07.2 Determiners decomposed\n\nNormally when we think about determiners we think about them as being\nfixed unary linguistic objects that have dedicated semantic roles, but\nis this so? Take the property of being a referring expression, for\nexample. We have spoken about whether descriptions are referring\nexpressions or not, but perhaps it is incorrect to suppose that there\nare dedicated referring expressions in natural language. Ahn (2019)\nargues that what is called on to refer can vary greatly in natural\nlanguage, and that what expressions are deployed in order to refer\ndepends on what else is available to do the job. She proposes a\n\u201ccompetition mechanism\u201d which determines which expression\nmight be deployed in order to refer to something.\u00a0 In some cases\nit might be a name, in some a demonstrative, in some a pronoun, and in\nsome a description.\u00a0 It depends on which expression wins the\ncompetition in that setting. What this means, if correct, is that the\njob of reference would not be associated with a single type of\nsyntactic object, but with a large array of syntactic objects. In a\nsimilar vein, Ludlow and \u017divanovic (2022) have suggested that what\ncounts as quantificational may not be a property of individual\nmorphological items, but is more likely a global structural\nproperty.\u00a0 In this instance, the definite and indefinite\ndeterminers play more of a role as structure builders and not as\nindividual operators. The kind of quantificational structure that\nemerges would be a function of the surrounding syntactic objects.\n\nIt could also be the case that syntactic objects like the definite and\nindefinite determiners may not even be as syntactically simple as they\nappear.\u00a0 As noted above, Schwarz (2009) observed that there are\nlanguages in which morphologically distinct words are used to express\nuniqueness and familiarity. Following Stake (2009) and others working\nin \u201cnanosyntax,\u201d this would create some pressure to say\nthat the definite determiner in English might not be a single\nfunctional head, but is \u201csmeared\u201d across a larger phrase\nstructure that has separate functional heads for expressing uniqueness\nand familiarity.\u00a0 The English\u00a0determiner ends up being\nexploded across the phrase structure.\n7.3 Determiners as case markers\n\nDeterminers are rare in the world\u2019s languages and are not\nuniversally employed in Indo-European languages. For example they are\nnot found in Slavic languages, with the exception of southern Slavic\nlanguages like Bulgarian. But perhaps this provides an opportunity to\ngain some insights into the nature of determiners. We can actually\nstudy how the Bulgarian determiner system evolved from other Slavic\nlanguages.\n\nOne interesting fact to observe here, is that as noted by Hewson\n(1972; 66\u201367), languages with articles and languages with robust\ncase morphology are typically in complementary distribution. Indeed,\nas languages evolve, their robust inflectional system gives way to\nstructure dependent language (Leiss (2000)). It is when the case\nsystem weakens that determiners begin to appear\u2013\u2013an idea\nthat is offered in Abraham (1997:29), Philippi (1997:63\u201364),\nSelig (1992), Ivan\u010dev 1988:105, and (Mayer 1988: 112). As\nMladenova (2007) puts it, \u201cthe morphology of the definite\narticle makes it possible to perpetuate case distinctions long after\nthey have been obliterated elsewhere.\u201d (But see also Mladenova\nfor subtleties in applying this idea to Bulgarian.) Could it be then\nthat determiners serve the purpose of case marking? Iliev (2019)\nargues that this is what is happening in\nBulgarian\u2013\u2013genitive case markers have been replace by\ndeterminers, which continue to\u00a0express a kind of possessive\nrelation.\n\nHow does this idea work?\u00a0We can illustrate with some examples\nfrom English.\n\n\n(64) The car went in the ditch.\n\n(65) I was such a terrible bowler that the ball went in the\ngutter.\n\n(66) The car needs gas.\n\n(67) The doctor told me to stop eating red meat.\n\n\nIt is easy to hear all of these examples as involving an implicit\npossessive operator.\n\n\n(64\u2032) The car went in the road\u2019s ditch.\n\n(65\u2032) I was such a terrible bowler that my ball went in\nmy lane\u2019s gutter.\n\n(66\u2032) Our car needs gas.\n\n(67\u2032) My doctor told me to stop eating red meat.\n\n\nExample (65) is particularly instructive in this regard. If I am an\nexceptionally terrible bowler I might toss the ball into the gutter of\nsomeone else\u2019s lane. In this case I might be more apt to say\n\u201cThe ball went in a gutter\u201d; saying that it went\nin the gutter doesn\u2019t quite seem to do justice to my failure as\na bowler. That is because when I say the ball went in the\ngutter it suggests that it at least ended up in my\ngutter.\n\nThe claim, however, is not that the definite determiner is functioning\nas a possessive. The hypothesis is that it is functioning as a\nmulti-purpose case marker, and when it is marking for genitive case,\npossessive meaning is one possible outcome. But genitive case can be\nput to other uses. For example, species names are routinely given in\nthe genitive case in Latin, and indeed it is a prescriptive rule about\nthe coining of a new species name that it be placed in genitive case.\nThe underlying deep motivation is presumably that species are part of\na genus, so that when one expresses a species name it is shorthand for\na more complete description. So, for example, when we say \u2018The\ntiger\u2019, we are offering up an abbreviation of something like\n\u2018tiger, species of genus panthera\u2019 (or more accurately,\n\u2018panthera tigris, of genus panther\u2019). Note the possessive\nnature of these constructions. In effect, we are saying this:\n\u2018species panthera tigris, belonging to the genus\npanthera\u2019.\n\nThis genitive case analysis perhaps sheds light on what is going on in\nthe array of facts offered by Abbott and Horn. Consider (46)\nagain.\n\n\n(46) So Lufthansa is a\u2014or even the\u2014German\nairline.\n\n\nAs observed earlier, (46) can be asserted even if there is more than\none German airline. One intriguing possibility here is that the stress\nis creating what is known as a superlative genitive, an\nexample from Latin being sanctum sanctorum (holy of holies).\nIn the case of (46), for example, we are saying Lufthansa is the most\nGerman airline of German airlines. This idea would require a story\ninvolving some movement and copying of the noun within the determiner\nphrase, but such a story would not be unheard of in contemporary work\non the structure of determiner phrases (see Larson (2014)).\n\nWhat is also intriguing about this line of inquiry is that it suggests\na new strategy for accounting for definiteness. It is not\npragmatically extruded from givenness (as suggested by Ludlow and\nSegal) but rather from whatever meaning the genitive case brings with\nit \u2013 often some notion of possession. For example, an appearance\nof a description of the form \u2018the dog\u2019 in a sentence might\nindicate something like \u2018dog of the event\u2019 or \u2018dog\nbearing some thematic role to the event\u2019. From this bit of\ninformation, the pragmatics might allow us infer that there is a\nunique dog.\n\nIt would not be fruitful to suggest that definite determiners\nalways play the role of case assignment, and they most\ncertainly cannot be cashed out as exclusively assigning genitive case.\nThe prospects for a unified explanation for determiner behavior seems\nremote. The evidence does suggest however, that definite determiners\ncan often play the role of supplying case, and this may go some way\ntowards explaining some of the most recalcitrant facts involving\ndescriptions.\n8. Conclusion\n\nA close study of the syntax and semantics of natural language suggests\nthat constructions of the form \u2018the F\u2019 and\n\u2018an F\u2019 are not only rare in natural languages,\nbut potentially misleading in languages like English. These\nexpressions really don\u2019t carry out the logical roles that\nRussell and subsequent authors have thought. However, Russell\u2019s\ncore insight remains intact: The critical question is whether the\nsentences in which they appear are quantificational or referential,\nand Russell may well be right about the critical cases here. That is,\nmany apparently referential constructions may in fact be\nquantificational. What Russell didn\u2019t see was that surface\ngrammar is more deceptive than even he realized. Elements like\n\u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 do not directly encode\nquantifiers or uniqueness clauses. The task for philosophers of\nlanguage now is the thorny task of figuring out what information they\ndo encode.\n",
