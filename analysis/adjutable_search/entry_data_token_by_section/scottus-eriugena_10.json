    "main_text": "The Philosophical System of the Periphyseon\n3. The Philosophical System of the Periphyseon\n\nEriugena\u2019s masterpiece is undoubtedly the Periphyseon\n(written c.862\u2013c.867), a long dialogue in five\nbooks\u2014between an anonymous \u201cteacher\u201d\n(Nutritor) and his \u201cstudent\u201d\n(Alumnus)\u2014that attempts to be a compendium of all\nknowledge presented within a Neoplatonic cosmology of the procession\nand return of all things from the divine One.\n\nThe Periphyseon, deeply influenced by Eriugena\u2019s\nengagement with Greek Christian authors, is a work of astonishing\nscope, a veritable Christian Neoplatonic summa. At the\nbeginning of Book Four, Eriugena labels his enterprise a\nphysiologia, a \u201cstudy of nature\u201d, and indeed one\nmanuscript of the Periphyseon in the British Library in\nLondon calls the whole dialogue \u201cLiber Phisiologiae Iohannis\nScottigenae\u201d. The term \u201cphysiologia\u201d\nis apt in that the term \u201cnature\u201d for Eriugena spans the\nwhole cosmological domain, including not just created nature but also\nthe Divine Creator, and treats of the essentially dialectical relation\nbetween Creator and created, where God expresses Himself in creation\nand creation culminates in return to the divine. Nature is to be\nunderstood as what is real in the widest sense, the totality of all\nthings that are and are not. Nature includes both God and creation and\nhas four divisions: nature which creates and is not created (God),\nnature which creates and is created (the Primordial Causes), nature\nwhich is created and does not create (the Created Temporal Effects),\nand nature which is neither created nor creates (Non-Being). The\noriginal intention (expressed at III.619d\u2013620b) was to devote\none book to each of the four divisions; thus Book One deals with the\ndivine nature and the procession or exitus of all things from\nGod, Book Two treats of the Primordial Causes, and Book Three of their\nCreated Effects, including the nature of ex nihilo creation\nand the stages of the creation of the world. The topic of creation\nrequires Eriugena to address issues related to the Biblical\naccount of creation, and thus, in Book Three, he embarks on his own\nversion of a Hexaemeron. The momentous event of the emergence\nof human nature on the Sixth Day of creation requires extended\ntreatment, and Eriugena is forced to devote a fourth book to this\ntopic, thus relegating the return of all things to God to a fifth\nbook. Thus, Eriugena was forced to depart from his original plan of\nfour books and add a fifth. This change of plan is particularly\nimportant in that it helps to identify different stages of composition\nof the text.\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of the Periphyseon is\nEriugena\u2019s ability to bring together into a symphony of ideas\nsuch a variety of thinkers and sources: the liberal arts and the philosophical dialogue traditions, the officina omnium anthropology of Maximus Confessor, the\ntheophanic ontology of Dionysius the Areopagite, Augustine\u2019s Trinitarian\ntheology, Basil the Great\u2019s realistic hermeneutics of the Hexaemeron, and Gregory\nof Nyssa\u2019s imago dei anthropology and his account of creation; however, we may say\nthat the grand tapestry of the Periphyseon is woven from many\nthreads but the fabric is Maximian. Maximus Confessor\u2019s vision\nprovides the impetus that drives the argument of the dialogue and also\nthe framework in which the encounter and conversation among the\nvarious sources takes place.\n",
