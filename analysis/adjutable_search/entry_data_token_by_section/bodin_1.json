    "main_text": "Bodin\u2019s Methodology of History and Law\n2. Bodin\u2019s Methodology of History and Law\nWhen he began his research, Bodin was drawn to analysis and\nsystematics as methods for organizing knowledge. In titling his work\n\u201cMethod\u201d, he gave a new and definitive meaning to a word\nwhich previous authors had used to signify both \u201cdivision\u201d\nand \u201cratio\u201d or \u201cthe procedure\u201d for\nlearning a\n discipline.[10] \n In Method, Bodin encourages his readers to use analysis,\nwhich he calls \u201cthat pre-eminent guide to the teaching of the\narts [\u2026] in order that understanding of history\n(historiarum scientia) shall be complete and facile\u201d\n(Methodus, [Re] 20; Latin [Me] 116).  According to Bodin, it\nis through analysis that one is able to divide universals into parts,\nand to divide each part into subsections without losing the coherence\nof the whole. Therefore synthesis, he states, is no longer necessary\nbecause the individual episodes of nearly all historical accounts are\nalready well adapted to each other, and the best historians\nhave carefully reconstructed these partial and regional accounts into\nthe tableau of universal history. Bodin writes (Methodus [Me]\n116):\n\nI call that history universal which embraces the affairs of all, or of\nthe most famous peoples, or of those whose deeds in war and in peace\nhave been handed down to us from an early stage of their national\ngrowth ([Re] 21).\n \n\n Bodin ascribes a unique role to political\nknowledge, thereby distinguishing his writings from many similar\ntreatments of the ars historica which were published at the\nend of the fifteenth\n century.[11] \n The masterpieces of this genre were produced in Italy such as\nFrancesco Patrizi, Della historia dialoghi dece, 1560; and in\nFrance by Fran\u00e7ois Bauduin, De institutione historiae\nuniversae et ejus cum jurisprudentia conjunctione, Paris\n1561. Although he does not cite Bauduin, Bodin was indebted to this\nFrench author who was the first to describe in a scientific manner the\nmultiple connections between law and universal history. The chapter\nheadings include: \n\n\nWhat History is and of How Many Categories \nThe Order of Reading Historical Treatises\nThe Proper Arrangement of Historical Material\nThe Choice of Historians\nThe Correct Evaluation of Histories\nThe Type of Government in States\nRefutation of those who Postulate Four Monarchies and the Golden Age\nA System of Universal Time\nCriteria by which to Test the Origins of Peoples\nThe Order and Collection of\n  Historians[12]\n\n\nFor Bodin, methodologies were visual representations of systems of\nknowledge.  He makes this point in his work Exposition, where\nhe states that the concept of \u201cdivision,\u201d which Plato had\ncalled divine, is the \u201cuniversal rule of the sciences\u201d (See also\nJuris, 1578).  If history is divided into divine history,\nnatural history, and human history, then law can be divided into\nnatural law, human law, the laws of nations, public law, and civil\nlaw. From there, Bodin briefly describes and defines legal matters\nincluding: contracts, crimes, property, obligation, authority,\njurisdiction, etc. Here more than in the Method, the reader\nsees Bodin\u2019s pedagogical preoccupation with brevity and\nconciseness. The work is also illustrated with a number of schematic\ntables. In the private sphere, Bodin demonstrated his talent for\nteaching in A Letter to his Nephew\n(\u00c9p\u00eetre, 1585), and in the short Advice on\nthe Education of a Prince (Conseil, 1574\u20131586),\nwhich had limited circulation.\n",
