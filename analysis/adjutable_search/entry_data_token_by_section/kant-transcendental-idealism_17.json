For instance, this passage from the\n\u201cAesthetic\u201d:\n\n\neverything in our cognition that belongs to intuition (with the\nexception, therefore, of the feeling of pleasure and displeasure and\nthe will, which are not cognitions at all) contains nothing but mere\nrelations, of places in one intuition (extension), alteration of\nplaces (motion), and laws in accordance with which this alteration is\ndetermined (moving forces). (B67)\n\n\nThis, and other passages Langton cites, support attributing to Kant\nthese theses:\n\n(1)\nAppearances (phenomena) have only relational properties. (B67,\nA265/B321, A285/B341)\n (2)\n When we conceive of an object purely intellectually we conceive\nof it as having intrinsic properties. (A274/B330, A277/B333)\n (3)\n In knowing relational properties we do not know things as they\nare in themselves. (B67)\n\n\nHowever, in none of these passages does Kant directly state the\nstronger claim that:\n\n(4)\n Phenomena are extrinsic properties of substances with intrinsic\nproperties.\n\n\nIt is clear that Kant holds (1)\u2013(3) and less clear that he holds\n(4). The textual case for (4) is weaker, though not absent. It is\npresented below, in\n sub-section 4.5.2.\n\nThere is a further textual problem for Langton\u2019s interpretation,\nthough. In at least two passages Kant denies that we can know\nrelations between things in themselves:\n\n\nSpace represents no property at all of any things in themselves nor\nany relation of them each other [\u2026] (A26/B42)\n\n[\u2026] the things that we intuit are not in themselves what we\nintuit them to be, nor are their relations so constituted in\nthemselves as they appear to us. (A42/B59)\n\n\nIn these passages Kant claims that space is not a relation among\nthings in themselves, nor are relations among objects \u201cin\nthemselves\u201d as they appear to us. This is hard to square with\nLangton\u2019s reading. However, in her (2011) Langton responds to\nthese textual objections by suggesting that the relations among things\nin themselves of which Kant speaks are internal relations,\nrelations that supervene on the intrinsic properties of\n substances.[49]\n4.5.2 Phenomena substantiata\n\nOne source of resistance to Langton\u2019s interpretation is that\nKant argues at length in the \u201cFirst Analogy of Experience\u201d\nthat the category substance can be applied to phenomena: \n\n\nall appearances contain that which persists (substance) as the object\nitself, and that which can change as its mere determination, i.e., a\nway in which the object exists. (A182) \n\n\nThis would appear to contradict Langton\u2019s assertion that things\nin themselves are substances, while appearances (phenomena) are merely\nproperties of substances.\n\nLangton is well aware that Kant accepts \u201cphenomenal\nsubstances\u201d and endeavors to explain this within her picture. In\ndoing so, she compiles a compelling set of textual evidence for her\nalternative reading of the \u201cFirst Analogy\u201d and the meaning\nof substance for phenomena. She begins by pointing to\nAlexander Gottlieb Baumgarten\u2019s notion of a phaenomena\nsubstantiata, a \u201csubstantiated phenomenon\u201d, by which\nBaumgarten means a property that we treat as a substance by\npredicating other properties of it (Baumgarten, Metaphysica\n\u00a7193 (Ak. 18:150); quoted at Langton 1998: 53). She argues\nconvincingly that Kant\u2019s fundamental notion of a substance is of\na being with properties but which is not a property of anything\n else.[50]\n Only such beings, of which other things are predicated (inhere in)\nbut which are not predicated of (inhere in) anything else, are truly\nsubstances. However, the properties that are predicated of substances\ncan also be spoken of as substances, because they themselves have\nproperties (which might also have properties, and so\n on).[51]\n These are substantiated phenomena.\n\nThe question is, are Kantian empirical substances genuine substances\nor mere substantiated phenomena? Do the objects subsumed under the\nempirical schema of substance (absolute persistence in time) also fall\nunder the pure category of substance (subjects of inherence which\ninhere in nothing further)? If not, then they must be predicated of\nsome more fundamental substance, which drives Langton to conclude that\nappearances (phenomena) are properties of substances (she does point\nout the hesitant terms in which Kant describes phenomena as substances\n(1998, 57). Langton assembles an impressive array of evidence that\nKant does regard empirical \u201csubstances\u201d as phaenomena\nsubstantiata (e.g., A265/B321, A277/B333, Refl. 4421, 4422, 5294,\nAk. 28:209). However, in context it is not clear whether Kant has the\nBaumgarten notion in mind, or whether this Latin expression means\nsimply: phenomenal substance. So it is unclear, textually, whether\nphenomena are predicated of noumena in the\n Critique.[52]\n\nIn his metaphysics lectures, and other texts, Kant consistently\ndistinguishes the inherence relation (which holds between a property\nand an entity of which it is predicated) from the relation of\nground to consequence:\n\n\nThe world \u201csubstance\u201d is clearly ambiguous. One translates\nit through the notion of self-sufficiency, i.e., the possibility of\nexisting without a ground, but also as the possibility of existing\nwithout inhering [in something else]. (Ak. 28:1308; Ak. 8:225n,\n28:562, 28:779, 28:638\u20139, 28:1041, 28:1104f)\n\n\nKant, following Baumgarten, criticizes Spinoza\u2019s definition of\nsubstance as \u201cwhat is in itself and conceived through\nitself\u201d (Ethics Id3) because it conflates two notions:\n(i) a being that is not grounded in, or caused by, anything more\nfundamental, and (ii) a being that does not inhere in anything more\nfundamental. The second is the correct definition of substance,\naccording to Kant; by conflating these two notions, Spinoza forecloses\nthe following possibility: there are substances distinct from God\n(they are not modes of God), all of which are grounded in God.\n\nTo bring this back to Langton, we need to distinguish two different\nclaims:\n\n(i) \n Phenomena are extrinsic properties of substances (things in\nthemselves). They inhere in things in themselves.\n(ii) \n Phenomena exist (at least partly) in virtue of the extrinsic\nproperties of substances (things in themselves). They are grounded in\nthings in themselves.\n\n\nLangton attributes (i) to Kant, but her textual case appears to\nsupport (ii), at\n best.[53]\n This is significant, because (ii) is far less controversial. For\ninstance, it is in principle acceptable to the qualified\nphenomenalist, because the extrinsic properties of things in\nthemselves include (presumably) properties like causing us to have\nsuch and such experience.\n",
