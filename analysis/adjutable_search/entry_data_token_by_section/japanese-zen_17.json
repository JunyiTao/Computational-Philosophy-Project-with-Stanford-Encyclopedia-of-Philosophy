    "main_text": "Zen\u2019s Understanding of Time and Space || Zero Time and Zero Space\n7.2 Zero Time and Zero Space\n\nZen however thinks that the preceding is still a partial understanding\nof \u201chere and now.\u201d To fully understand it, it is helpful\nto examine the following often-quoted phrase, as it is particularly\nillustrative. Zen demands that the practitioner \u201cshow\none\u2019s original face before one\u2019s parents were born.\u201d\nThis demand points to an experiential dimension prior to the\nbifurcation between the subject and the object\u2014and hence\n\u201cnot two\u201d\u2014where \u201cprior\u201d means negation\nof the spatial-temporal ordering principles such as in Kant\u2019s\nunderstanding of time and space as a priori forms of\nintuition. It points to a non-dualistic experiential dimension that is\nzero-time and zero-space, by which Zen means that neither time nor\nspace is a delimiting condition for Zen-seeing. In zero-time there is\nno distinction between past, present, and future, or between\n\u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d; in zero- space there is\nno distinction between the whole and its parts. One can also say that\nboth time and space, experienced from the point-of-view of the\neveryday standpoint, is relativized when zero-time temporizes\nand zero-space spatializes, where zero time and zero space\ncharacterize the bottomless ground. Accordingly, Zen contends that\nzero-time and zero-space are the natural and primordial being of all\nthings including human beings, for they are all grounded in it. Taking\nthese points together, the Zen enlightenment experience suggests a\nleap from a causal temporal series. \n\nConsequently, Zen contends that \u201chere and now\u201d is enfolded\nin both zero-time and zero-space. This means that one time contains\nall times and one part contains the whole, as in the case of a\nholographic dry plate in which each part contains the whole. (See the \nentry on \n Japanese Philosophy, Section 2.2.)\nSeen in\nthis manner, \u201cnow\u201d for the Zen person is a temporalization\nof zero-time, while \u201chere\u201d is equally a spatialization of\nzero-space, even though he or she may be anchored in the perceptual\nfield of \u201chere and now\u201d as understood above. In other\nwords, for the Zen person both \u201cnow\u201d and\n\u201chere\u201d are experienced as an expression of thing-events in\ntheir suchness, because, as mentioned in the foregoing, Zen takes\nzero- time and zero-space to be the original abode of thing-events.\nCaution must be exercised here, however. Zen\u2019s zero-time should\nnot be confounded with the idea of eternity standing outside a\ntemporal series (Thomas Aquinas\u2019s or Newton\u2019s\n\u201cabsolute time,\u201d for example) by means of a logical or intellectual\ntranscendence, nor should the zero-space be identified with\na Newtonian-like \u201cabsolute space\u201d wherein there is no\ncontent of experience. In other words, Zen does not understand time\nand space by imposing a formal category on them, by\npresupposing in advance a form-matter distinction, which\nindicates an operation of the discursive mode of reasoning by\nappealing to the either-or, dualistic, and ego-logical epistemological\nstructure. \n",
