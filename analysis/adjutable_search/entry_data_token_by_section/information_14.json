    "main_text": "Developments in Philosophy of Information || Shannon: Information Defined in Terms of Probability\n4.2 Shannon: Information Defined in Terms of Probability\n\nIn two landmark papers Shannon (1948; Shannon & Weaver 1949)\ncharacterized the communication entropy of a system of messages\nA: \n\\[\nH(P) = -\\sum_{i\\in A} p_i \\log_2 p_i\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(p_i\\) is the probability of message i in A. This\nis exactly the formula for Gibb\u2019s entropy in physics. The use of\nbase-2 logarithms ensures that the code length is measured in bits\n(binary digits). It is easily seen that the communication entropy of a\nsystem is maximal when all the messages have equal probability and\nthus are typical. \n\nThe amount of information I in an individual message x\nis given by:  \n\\[\nI(x) = -\\log p_x\n\\]\n\n\nThis formula, that can be interpreted as the inverse of the Boltzmann\nentropy, covers a number of our basic intuitions about\ninformation:\n\nA message x has a certain probability \\(p_x\\) between 0 and\n1 of occurring. \nIf \\(p_x = 1\\) then \\(I(x) = 0\\). If we are certain to get a\nmessage it literally contains no \u201cnews\u201d at al. The lower\nthe probability of the message is, the more information it contains. A\nmessage like \u201cThe sun will rise tomorrow\u201d seems to contain\nless information than the message \u201cJesus was Caesar\u201d\nexactly because the second statement is much less likely to be\ndefended by anyone (although it can be found on the web).\nIf two messages x and y are unrelated then \\(I(x\n\\textrm{ and } y)=I(x) + I(y)\\). Information is extensive.\nThe amount of information in two combined messages is equal to the sum\nof the amount of information in the individual messages. \n\n\nInformation as the negative log of the probability is the only\nmathematical function that exactly fulfills these constraints (Cover\n& Thomas 2006). Shannon offers a theoretical framework in which\nbinary strings can be interpreted as words in a (programming) language\ncontaining a certain amount of information (see\n 3.1 Languages).\n The expression \\(-\\log p_x\\) exactly gives the length of an optimal\ncode for message x and as such formalizes the old intuition\nthat codes are more efficient when frequent letters get shorter\nrepresentations (see\n 3.2 Optimal codes).\n Logarithms as a reduction of multiplication to addition (see\n 3.3 Numbers)\n are a natural representation of extensive properties of systems and\nalready as such had been used by physicists in the nineteenth century\n(see\n 3.4 Physics).\n\nOne aspect of information that Shannon\u2019s definition explicitly\ndoes not cover is the actual content of the messages interpreted as\npropositions. So the statement \u201cJesus was Caesar\u201d and\n\u201cThe moon is made of green cheese\u201d may carry the same\namount of information while their meaning is totally different. A\nlarge part of the effort in philosophy of information has been\ndirected to the formulation of more semantic theories of information\n(Bar-Hillel & Carnap 1953; Floridi 2002, 2003, 2011). Although\nShannon\u2019s proposals at first were almost completely ignored by\nphilosophers it has in the past decennia become apparent that their\nimpact on philosophical issues is big. Dretske (1981) was one of the\nfirst to analyze the philosophical implications of Shannon\u2019s\ntheory, but the exact relation between various systems of logic and\ntheory of information are still unclear (see\n 6.6 Logic and Semantic Information).\n \n",
