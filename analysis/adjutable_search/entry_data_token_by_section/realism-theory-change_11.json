    "main_text": "Scientific Realism and the Pessimistic Induction || Induction or Deduction?\n2.8 Induction or Deduction?\n\nIn the more recent literature, there has been considerable debate as\nto how exactly we should understand PI. There are those, like Anjan\nChakravartty who take it that PI is an Induction. He says:\n\n\nPI can \u2026 be described as a two-step worry. First, there is an\nassertion to the effect that the history of science contains an\nimpressive graveyard of theories that were previously believed [to be\ntrue], but subsequently judged to be false \u2026 Second, there is\nan induction on the basis of this assertion, whose conclusion is that\ncurrent theories are likely future occupants of the same graveyard.\n(2008: 152)\n\n\nYet, it is plausible to think that qua an inductive argument,\nhistory-based pessimism is bound to fail. The key point here is that\nthe sampling of theories which constitute the inductive evidence is\nneither random nor otherwise representative of theories in\ngeneral.\n\nIt has been argued that, seen as an inductive argument, PI is\nfallacious: it commits the base-rate fallacy (cf. Lewis 2001). If in\nthe past there have been many more false theories than true ones, (if,\nin other words, truth has been rare), it cannot be concluded that\nthere is no connection between success and truth. Take S to\nstand for Success and not-S to stand for failure.\nAnalogously, take T to stand for truth of theory T\nand not-T for falsity of theory T. Assume also that\nthe probability that a theory is unsuccessful given that it is true is\nzero \\((\\textrm{Prob}({\\textrm{not-}S}\\mid T)=0)\\) and that the\nprobability that a theory is successful given that it is false is\n0.05 \\((\\textrm{Prob}(S\\mid {\\textrm{not-}T})=0.05)\\). Assume that is,\nthat there is a very high True Positives (successful but true) rate\nand a small False Positives (successful but false theories) rate. We\nmay then ask the question: How likely is it that a theory is true,\ngiven that it is successful? That is, what is the posterior\nprobability \\(\\textrm{Prob}(T\\mid S)\\)?\n\nThis answer is indeterminate if we don\u2019t take into account the\nbase-rate of truth, viz., the incidence rate of truth in the\npopulation of theories. If the base rate is very low (let\u2019s\nassume that only 1 in 50 theories have been true), then it is\nunlikely that T is true given success.\n\\(\\textrm{Prob}(T\\mid S)\\) would be around 0.3. But this does not imply\nsomething about the connection between success and truth. It is still\nthe case that the false positives are low and that the true positives\nhigh. The low probability is due to the fact that truth is rare (or\nthat falsity is much more frequent). For \\(\\textrm{Prob}(T\\mid S)\\) to be\nhigh, it must be the case that \\(\\textrm{Prob}(T)\\) is not too small.\nBut if \\(\\textrm{Prob}(T)\\) is low, it can dominate over a high\nlikelihood of true positives and lead to a very low posterior\nprobability \\(\\textrm{Prob}(T\\mid S)\\). Similarly, the probability that a\ntheory is false given that it is successful (i.e.,\n\\(\\textrm{Prob}({\\textrm{not-}T}\\mid S))\\) may be high simply because\nthere are a lot more false theories than true ones. As Peter Lewis put\nit:\n\n\nAt a given time in the past, it may well be that false theories vastly\noutnumber true theories. In that case, even if only a small proportion\nof false theories are successful, and even if a large proportion of\ntrue theories are successful, the successful false theories may\noutnumber the successful true theories. So the fact that successful\nfalse theories outnumber successful true theories at some time does\nnothing to undermine the reliability of success as a test for truth at\nthat time, let alone at other times (2001: 376\u20137).\n\n\nSeen in this light, PI does not discredit the reliability of success\nas a test for truth of a theory; it merely points to the fact that\ntruth is scarce among past\n theories.[11]\n\nChallenging the inductive credentials of PI has acquired a life of its\nown. A standard objection (cf. Mizrahi 2013) is that theories are not\nuniform enough to allow an inductive generalization of the form\n\u201cseen one, seen them all\u201d. That is, theories are diverse\nenough over time, structure and content not to allow us to take a few\nof them\u2014not picked randomly\u2014as representative of all and\nto project the characteristics shared by those picked to all theories\nin general. In particular, the list that Laudan produced is not a\nrandom sample of theories. They are all before the twentieth century\nand all have been chosen solely on the basis that they had had some\nsuccesses (irrespective of how robust these successes were). An\nargument of the form:\n\n\nX % of past successful theories are false\n\nTherefore, X % of all successful theories are false\n\n\nwould be a weak inductive argument because\n\n\nit fails to provide grounds for projecting the property of the\nobserved members of the reference class to unobserved members of the\nreference class. (Mizrahi 2013: 3219)\n\n\nThings would be different, if we had a random sampling of theories.\nMizrahi (2013: 3221\u20133222) collected 124 instances of\n\u2018theory\u2019 from various sources and picked at random 40 of\nthem. These 40 were then divided into three groups: accepted theories,\nabandoned theories and debated theories. Of those 40 theories, 15%\nwere abandoned and 12% debated. Mizrahi then notes that these randomly\nselected data cannot justify an inductively drawn conclusion that most\nsuccessful theories are false. On the contrary, an optimistic\ninduction would be more warranted:\n\n\n72% of sampled theories are accepted theories (i.e., considered\ntrue).\n\nTherefore, 72% of all theories are accepted theories (i.e., considered\ntrue).\n\n\nMizrahi has come back to the issue of random sampling and has\nattempted to show that the empirical evidence is against PI:\n\n\nIf the history of science were a graveyard of dead theories and\nabandoned posits, then random samples of scientific theories and\ntheoretical posits would contain significantly more dead theories and\nabandoned posits than live theories and accepted posits.\n\nIt is not the case that random samples of scientific theories and\ntheoretical posits contain significantly more dead theories and\nabandoned posits than live theories and accepted posits.\n\nTherefore, It is not the case that the history of science is a\ngraveyard of dead theories and abandoned posits. (2016: 267)\n\n\nA similar argument has been defended by Park (2011). We may call it,\nthe explosion argument: Most key theoretical terms of successful\ntheories of the twentieth century refer \u201cin the light of current\ntheories\u201d. But then, \u201cmost central terms of successful\npast theories refer\u201d, the reason being that there are far more\ntwentieth century theories than theories in total. This is because\n\u201cthe body of scientific knowledge exploded in the twentieth\ncentury with far more human and technological resources\u201d (2011:\n79).\n\nLet\u2019s call this broad way to challenge the inductive credentials\nof the pessimistic argument \u2018the Privilege-for-current-theories\nstrategy\u2019. This has been adopted by Michael Devitt (2007) too,\nthough restricted to entities. Devitt, who takes realism to be a\nposition concerning the existence of unobservables, noted that the\nright question to ask is this: \u2018What is the \u201csuccess\nratio\u201d of past theories?\u2019, where the \u201csuccess\nratio\u201d is \u201cthe ratio of the determinately existents to the\ndeterminately nonexistents + indeterminates\u201d. Asserting a\nprivilege for current science, he claims that \u201cwe are now\nmuch better at finding out about unobservables\u201d.\nAccording to him, then, it is \u201cfairly indubitable\u201d that\nthe historical record shows \u201cimprovement over time in our\nsuccess ratio for unobservables\u2019.\n\nIn a similar fashion but focusing on current theories, Doppelt (2007)\nclaims that realists should confine their commitment to the\napproximate truth of current best theories, where best theories are\nthose that are both most successful and well established. The\nasymmetry between current best theories and past ones is such that the\nsuccess of current theories is of a different kind than the\nsuccess of past theories. The difference, Doppelt assumes, is so big\nthat the success of current theories can only be explained by assuming\nthat they are approximately true, whereas the explanation of the\nsuccess of past theories does not require this commitment.\n\nIf this is right, there is sufficient qualitative distance between\npast theories and current best ones to block\n\n\nany pessimistic induction from the successful-but-false superseded\ntheories to the likelihood that our most successful and\nwell-established current theories are also probably false. (Doppelt\n2007: 110).\n\n\nThe key difference, Doppelt argues, is that\n\n\nour best current theories enjoy a singular degree of empirical\nconfirmation impossible for their predecessors, given their ignorance\nof so many kinds of phenomena and dimensions of nature discovered by\nour best current theories.\n\n\nThis singular degree of empirical confirmation amounts to raising the\nstandards of empirical success to a level unreachable by past theories\n(cf. 2007: 112).\n\nThe advocate of PI can argue that past \u2018best theories\u2019\nalso raised and met the standards of empirical success, which\ninductively supports the conclusion that current best theories will be\nsuperseded by others which will meet even higher standards of success.\nDoppelt\u2019s reply is that this new version of PI \u201cshould not\nbe given a free pass as though it were on a par with the original\npessimistic induction\u201d the reason being that \u201cin the\nhistory of the sciences, there is greater continuity in standards of\nempirical success than in the theories taken to realize them\u201d.\nHence, the standards of empirical success change slower than theories.\nHence, it is not very likely that current standards of empirical\nsuccess will change any time soon.\n\nIt has been argued, however, that Doppelt cannot explain the novel\npredictive success of past theories without arguing that they had\ntruthlike constituents (cf. Alai 2017). Besides, as Alai puts it,\n\u201ccurrent best theories explain the (empirical) success of\ndiscarded ones only to the extent that they show that the latter were\npartly true\u201d (2017: 3282).\n\nThe \u2018Privilege-for-current-theories strategy\u2019 has been\nsupported by Ludwig Fahrbach (2011). The key point of this strategy is\nthat the history of science does not offer a representative sample of\nthe totality of theories that should be used to feed the historical\npessimism of PI. In order to substantiate this, Fahrbach suggested,\nbased on extensive bibliometric data, that over the last three\ncenturies the number of papers published by scientists as well as the\nnumber of scientists themselves have grown exponentially,\nwith a doubling rate of 15\u201320 years. Hence, he claims, the past\ntheories that feed the historical premise of PI were produced during\nthe time of the first 5% of all scientific work ever done by\nscientists. As such the sample is totally unrepresentative of theories\nin total; and hence the pessimistic conclusion, viz., that current\ntheories are likely to be false and abandoned in due course, is\ninductively unwarranted. Moreover, Fahrbach argues, the vast majority\nof theories enunciated in the last 50\u201380 years, (which\nconstitute the vast majority of scientific work ever produced) are\nstill with us. Hence, as he puts it,\n\n\n(t)he anti-realist will have a hard time finding even one or two\nconvincing examples of similarly successful theories that were\naccepted in the last 50\u201380 years for some time, but later\nabandoned. (2011: 152)\n\n\nSince there have been practically no changes \u201camong our best\n(i.e., most successful) theories\u201d, Fahrbach suggests\n\n\nan optimistic meta-induction to the effect that they will remain\nstable in the future, i.e., all their empirical consequences which\nscientists will ever have occasion to compare with results from\nobservation at any time in the future are true. (2011: 153)\n\n\nThe conclusion is that the PI is unsound: \u201cits conclusion that\nmany of our current best scientific theories will fail empirically in\nthe future cannot be drawn\u201d (2011: 153).\n\nA key assumption of the foregoing argument is that there is a strong\nconnection between the amount of scientific work (as measured by the\nnumber of journal articles) and the degree of success of the best\nscientific theories. But this can be contested on the grounds that\nit\u2019s a lot easier to publish currently than it was in the\nseventeenth century and that current research is more tightly\nconnected to the defense of a single theoretical paradigm than before.\nThis might well be a sign of maturity of current science but, as it\nstands, it does not show that the present theoretical paradigm is not\nsubject to radical change. Florian M\u00fcller (2015) put the point in\nterms of decreasing marginal revenues. The correlation between\nincreased scientific work and scientific progress, which is assumed by\nFahrbach may not be strong enough:\n\n\nIt seems more plausible to expect decreasing marginal revenues of\nscientific work since it usually takes much less time to establish\nvery basic results than to make progress in a very advanced state of\nscience. (M\u00fcller 2015: 404)\n\n\nThe \u2018Privilege-for-current-theories strategy\u2019 can be\nfurther challenged on the grounds that it requires some\n\u201cfundamental difference between the theories we currently\naccept, and the once successful theories we have since rejected\u201d\n(Wray 2013: 4325). As Brad Wray (2013) has argued Fahrbach\u2019s\nstrategy is doomed to fail because the argument from exponential\ngrowth could be repeated at former periods too, thereby undermining\nitself. Imagine that we are back in 1950 and we look at the period\nbetween 1890 and 1950. We could then argue, along Farhbach\u2019s\nlines, that the pre-1890 theories (which were false and abandoned)\nwere an unrepresentative sample of all theories and that the recent\ntheories (1890\u20131950) are by far the most theories until 1950 and\nthat, since most of them have not been abandoned (by 1950), they are\nlikely to remain impervious to theory-change. Or imagine that we are\nfurther back in 1890 and look at the theories of the period\n1830\u20131890. We could run the same argument about those theories,\nviz, that they are likely to survive theory change. But if we look at\nthe historical pattern, they did not survive; nor did the\ntheories between 1890\u20131950. By the same token, we should not\nexpect current theories to survive theory-change.\n\nIs there room for defending an epistemic privilege for current\nscience? Two points are worth making. The first is that it\u2019s\nhard to defend some kind of epistemic privilege of current science if\nthe realist argument against PI stays only at a level of statistics\n(even assuming that there can be statistics over theories). If there\nis an epistemic privilege of current science in relation to past\nscience, it is not a matter of quantity but of quality. The\nissue is not specifying how likely it is that an arbitrary current\ntheory T be true, given the evidence of the past record of\nscience. The issue, instead, is how a specific scientific\ntheory\u2014a real theory that describes and explains certain\nwell-founded worldly phenomena\u2014is supported by the evidence\nthere is for it. If we look at the matter from this perspective, we\nshould look at case-histories and not at the history of science at\nlarge. The evidence there is for specific theory T (e.g., the\nDarwinian synthesis or GTR etc.) need not be affected by past failures\nin the theoretical understanding of the world in general. The reason\nis that there is local epistemic privilege, that is, privilege over\npast relevant theories concerning first-order evidence and specific\nmethods.\n\nThe second point is this. Wray\u2019s argument against Fahrbach is,\nin effect, that there can be a temporal meta-(meta-)induction which\nundermines at each time t (or period Dt) the\nprivilege that scientific theories at t or Dt are\nsupposed to have. So Wray\u2019s point is this: at each time\n\\(t_{i}\\) (or period \\(Dt_{i}\\)), scientists claim that their theories\nare not subject to radical change at subsequent times; but if we look\nat the pattern of theory change over time, the history of science\nshows that there have been subsequent times \\(t_{i}+1\\) (or periods\n\\({Dt}_{i}+1\\)) such that the theories accepted at \\(t_{i}\\) were\nconsidered false and abandoned. Hence, he takes it that at no time\n\\(t_{i}\\) are scientists justified in accepting their theories as not\nbeing subject to radical change in the future. But this kind of\nargument is open to the following criticism. It assumes, as it were,\nunit-homogeneity, viz., that science at all times \\(t_{i}\\) (and all\nperiods \\({Dt}_{i}\\)) is the same when it comes to how far it is from\nthe truth. Only on this assumption can it be argued that at\nno time can scientists claim that their theories are not subject to\nradical change. For if there are senses in which subsequent theories\nare closer to the truth than their predecessors, it is not equally\nlikely that they will be overturned as their predecessors were.\n\nThe point, then, is that though at each time \\(t_{i}\\) (or period\n\\({Dt}_{i}\\)) scientists might well claim that their theories are not\nsubject to radical change at subsequent times, they are not equally\njustified in making this claim! There might well be times\n\\(t_{i}\\) (or periods \\({Dt}_{i}\\)) in which scientists are more\njustified in making the claims that their theories are not subject to\nradical change at subsequent times simply because they have reasons to\nbelieve that their theories are truer than their predecessors. To give\nan example: if Wray\u2019s argument is right then Einstein\u2019s\nGTR is as likely to be overthrown at future time \\(t_{2100}\\) as was\nAristotle\u2019s crystalline spheres theory in past time\n\\(t_{-300}\\). But this is odd. It totally ignores the fact that all\navailable evidence renders GTR closer to the truth than the simply\nfalse Aristotelian theory. In other words, that GTR has substantial\ntruth-content makes it less likely to be radically revised in the\nfuture.\n\nAn analogous point was made by Park (2016). He defined what he called\nProportional Pessimism as the view that \u201cas theories\nare discarded, the inductive rationale for concluding that the next\ntheories will be discarded grows stronger\u201d (2016: 835). This\nview entails that the more theories have been discarded before\nT is discarded, the more justified we are in thinking that\nT is likely to be discarded. However, it is also the case\nthat based on their greater success, we are more justified to take\nnewer theories to be more likely to be truthlike than older ones. We\nthen reach a paradoxical situation: we are justified to take newer\ntheories to be both more probable than older ones and more likely to\nbe abandoned than older ones.\n\nIf an inductive rendering of historical pessimism fails, would a\ndeductive rendering fare better? Could PI be considered at least as a\nvalid deductive argument? Wray (2015: 65) interprets the\noriginal argument by Laudan as being deductive. And he notes\n\n\nas far as Laudan is concerned, a single successful theory that is\nfalse would falsify the realist claim that (all) successful theories\nare true; and a single successful theory that refers to a non-existent\ntype of entity would falsify the realist claim that (all) successful\ntheories have genuinely referring theoretical terms.\n\n\nBut if this is the intent of the argument, history plays no\nrole in it. All that is needed is a single counterexample, past\nor present. This, it should be noted, is an endemic problem with all\nattempts to render PI as a deductive argument. M\u00fcller, for\ninstance, notes that the fundamental problem raised by PI is\n\u201csimply that successful theories can be false\u201d. He\nadds:\n\n\nEven just one counterexample (as long as it is not explained away)\nundermines the claim that truth is the best explanation for the\nsuccess of theories as it calls into question the explanatory\nconnection in general. (2015: 399)\n\n\nThus put, the history of past failures plays no role in PI. Any\ncounterexample, even one concerning a current theory, will do.\n\nHow is it best to understand the realist theses that the history of\nscience is supposed to undermine? Mizrahi (2013: 3224) notes that the\nrealist claim is not meant to be a universal statement. As he puts\nit:\n\n\nSuccess may be a reliable indicator of (approximate) truth, but this\nis compatible with some instances of successful theories that turn out\nnot to be approximately true. In other words, that a theory is\nsuccessful is a reason to believe that it is approximately true, but\nit is not a conclusive proof that the theory is approximately\ntrue.\n\n\nThe relation between success and (approximate) truth, in this sense,\nis more like the relation between flying and being a bird: flying\ncharacterizes birds even if kiwis do not fly. If this is so, then\nthere is need for more than one counter-example for the realist thesis\nto be undermined.\n\nA recent attempt to render PI as a deductive argument is by Timothy\nLyons. He (2016b) takes realism to issue in the following\nmeta-hypothesis: \u201cour successful scientific theories\nare (approximately) true\u201d. He then reconstructs PI thus:\n\n(D)\n\n1.\nIf (a) the realist meta-hypothesis were true, then (b) we would\nhave no successful theories that cannot be approximately true. (If we\ndid, each would be a \u201cmiracle,\u201d which no one of us\naccepts.)\n2.\nHowever, (not-b) we do have successful theories that cannot be\napproximately true: the list (of\n\u201cmiracles\u201d).\n3.\nTherefore, (not-a) the realist meta-hypothesis is false. (And\nthe no-miracles argument put forward to justify that meta-hypothesis\nis unacceptable.)\n\n\nThis is supposed to be a deductive argument against the \u2018meta\nhypothesis\u2019. But in his argument the history of science plays no\nrole. All that is needed for the argument above to be sound is a\nsingle instance of a successful theory that is not true. A\nsingle non-white swan is enough to falsify the hypothesis \u2018All\nswans are white\u2019\u2014there is no point in arguing here: the\nmore, the merrier! In a similar fashion, it doesn\u2019t add much to\nargument (D) to claim\n\n\nthe quest to empirically increase the quantity of instances (\u2026)\nis rather to secure the soundness of the modus tollens, to\nsecure the truth of the pivotal second premise, the claim that there\nare counterinstances to the realist meta-hypothesis. (Lyons 2016b:\n566)\n\n\nIn any case, a critical question is: can some\nfalse-but-rigorously-empirically-successful theories justifiably be\ndeemed truthlike from the point of view of successor theories? This\nquestion is hard to answer without looking at actual cases in the\nhistory of science. The general point, made by Vickers (2017) is that\nit is not enough for the challenger of realism to identify some\ncomponents of past theories which were contributing to their successes\nsuch that they were not retained in subsequent theories. The\nchallenger of realism should show that false components \u201cmerit\nrealist commitment\u201d. If they do not, \u201c (\u2026) that is\nenough to answer the historical challenge\u201d.\n\nMore generally, the search for a generic form of the pessimistic\nX-duction (In-duction or De-duction) has yielded the\nfollowing problem: If the argument is inductive, it is at best weak.\nIf the argument is deductive, even if it is taken to be sound, it\nmakes the role of the history of science\n irrelevant.[12]\n",
