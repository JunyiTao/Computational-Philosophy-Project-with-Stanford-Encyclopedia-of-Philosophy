    "main_text": "Interpretations and method\n1. Interpretations and method\n\nAquinas\u2019 moral and political philosophy has to be reconstructed\nfrom his theological treatises and commentaries and his commentaries\non Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics and the first two and\nhalf books of Aristotle\u2019s Politics. Its proper\ninterpretation has been a matter of some difficulty from the time of\nhis death in 1274. In recent decades the way to understand some\naspects of its foundational concepts and logic has been strenuously\ndisputed, not least among those philosophers who see it as offering a\nbroadly sound answer to radical scepticism about value and obligation,\nan answer truer and more human than Kant\u2019s or Bentham\u2019s or\ntheir (in the broadest sense) successors\u2019. A partial sample of\nthese controversies is given in 1.1 and 1.2 below, which state the\nmore common interpretation on two strategic issues and then elaborate\nobjections to those interpretations. The remainder of this article\nthen proceeds on the basis that there is merit in these objections,\nand that the study of Aquinas\u2019 ethics as a systematic and\nstrictly philosophical work of practical reason (at its most general\nand reflective) is still in its infancy. Further textual support, from\nover 60 of Aquinas\u2019 works, can be found in Finnis 1998.\nCriticisms of the interpretation of Aquinas\u2019 theory that is\nproposed in that work can be found in Paterson 2006, Wheatley 2015,\nLong 2004, and earlier in Lisska 1998 and McInerny 1997. These works\nargue in various ways that that interpretation denies or neglects the\nmetaphysical foundations of the principles of practical reason that it\noffers to identify. Support, in general, for the approach in this\narticle will be found in Rhonheimer 2012 and 2000. The first issue\nunderlying this debate is whether the order of inquiry and coming to\nknow (the epistemological order) is the same as the order of\nmetaphysical dependence. The second issue is whether we can settle the\nfirst issue by using the epistemological axiom that we come to an\n(ultimately metaphysical) understanding of dynamic natures by\nunderstanding capacities through their actuations \u2013 which, in\nturn, we come to understand by understanding their objects. Does or\ndoes not that axiom entail that understanding of objects such as the\nintelligible goods (the objects of acts of will) precedes an adequate\nknowledge of nature, notwithstanding that (as is agreed on all sides)\nin the metaphysical order of intrinsic dependence such objects could\nnot be willed or attained but for the given nature of (in this case)\nthe human person?\n",
