    "main_text": "Two Problems of Theoretical Terms\n3. Two Problems of Theoretical Terms\n\nThe problem of theoretical terms is a recurrent theme in the\nphilosophy of science literature (Achinstein 1965; Sneed 1979: ch. II;\nTuomela 1973: ch. V; Friedman 2011). Different shades of meaning have\nbeen associated with this problem. In its most comprehensive\nformulation, the problem of theoretical terms is to give a proper\naccount of the meaning and reference of theoretical terms. There are\nat least two kinds of expression that pose a distinct problem of\ntheoretical terms, respectively. First, unary predicates referring to\ntheoretical entities, such as \u2018electron\u2019,\n\u2018neutrino\u2019 and \u2018nucleotide\u2019. Second, non-unary\ntheoretical predicates, such as \u2018homology\u2019 in evolutionary\nbiology and theoretical function expressions, such as\n\u2018force\u2019, \u2018temperature\u2019 and \u2018intensity of\nthe electromagnetic field\u2019 in physics. Sneed\u2019s problem of\ntheoretical terms, as expounded in (1979: ch. II), concerns only the\nlatter kind of expression. We shall now start surveying problems\nconcerning the semantics of expressions for theoretical entities and\nthen move on to expressions for theoretical relations and\nfunctions.\n",
