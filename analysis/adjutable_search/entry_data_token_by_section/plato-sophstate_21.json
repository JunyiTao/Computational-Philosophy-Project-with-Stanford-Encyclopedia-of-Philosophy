    "main_text": "Method and Metaphysics in the Statesman || Weaving and Statecraft\n8. Metaphysics and Dialectic in the Sophist and Statesman\n\n\nIn the first part of the Parmenides, the youthful Socrates\nsets out a theory of forms reminiscent of forms in the Phaedo\nand the Republic, and the main speaker, Parmenides, puts his\ntheory to the test by focusing on two chief questions: What forms are\nthere? and what is the nature of the relation between sensible things and their features\nand forms\u2014the relation known as participation? At the end of the\ninterrogation in Part I, when Socrates has failed to rescue his\ntheory, and we might think that Plato should simply junk it,\nParmenides comes to its defense, saying that if someone with an eye on\nall the difficulties denies that there are stable forms, he will have\nnowhere to turn his thought and will destroy the power of dialectic\nentirely (Parmenides 135b\u2013c). Scholars look to the\nSophist and Statesman and other late dialogues in\nthe hope of finding Plato\u2019s answer to the problems posed in the\nParmenides. Does Plato continue to treat forms as he did in\nthe Phaedo and Republic, despite the objections? Are\nthe objections answerable and was Socrates simply too inexperienced to\nanswer them adequately? Do the late dialogues record Plato\u2019s on-going\nperplexity? Or do they seriously modify Plato\u2019s earlier positions?\n\n\nOur investigation of the Sophist and Statesman\nprompts two observations. First, these two dialogues are engaged in\ndialectic from beginning to end, and the Statesman explicitly\nclaims that the exercise aims to make us better dialecticians\n(Statesman 285d, 286d\u2013287a). So Plato clearly thinks\nthat dialectic remains possible, and his Stranger seems actively\nengaged in helping his young interlocutors practice and learn the\ntechniques. Many scholars think that the method of dichotomous\ndivision is the method of dialectic in Plato\u2019s late\ndialogues. Certainly this method serves a valuable heuristic purpose,\noften revealing what makes a particular concept (e.g., sophist,\nstatesman) puzzling, but once the puzzle has come to light, the main\nspeaker reorients the discussion and introduces new tools and\ntechniques (e.g., five great kinds, division by limbs). Platonic\ndialectic employs numerous and varied techniques adjusted to the\nspecial topic being explored.\n\n\n\nSecond, the Sophist and Statesman say a lot about\nforms, and yet the forms discussed in these dialogues seem different\nin some key respects from those discussed in the Phaedo and\nfirst part of the Parmenides. Both the Sophist and\nStatesman search for the essence of their target kinds, the\nstable feature or collection of features that makes its possessor what\nit is. Each dialogue succeeds in revealing the essence of the kinds\ninvestigated. Are the sophist, the statesman, the angler, the weaver,\nand their arts separate forms of the sort discussed in the first part\nof the Parmenides? Strange if they were, since the arts are\nhuman inventions. The visitor does say (as noted in \u00a7 2 above)\nthat \u201cimmaterial things, being finest and greatest, are revealed\nclearly only by means of a verbal account (logos) and by\nnothing else,\u201d and that \u201call things now said are for the\nsake of those\u201d (Statesman 285e\u2013286b). The sophist\nand the statesman rank among great and difficult things\n(Sophist 218c\u2013d, Statesman 278e;\ncf. 279a\u2013b), and their arts are immaterial, though immanent in\ntheir possessors. So the visitor\u2019s statement need not refer to\nseparate forms. Still, the Timaeus (widely regarded as a late\ndialogue) speaks of separate immaterial forms, and such forms would be\nincluded in the Stranger\u2019s statement. Whatever one makes of the\ntreatment of forms in the Timaeus, separate forms are absent\nfrom the Sophist and Statesman, with one notable\nexception: at Sophist 245e\u2013249d (the Battle of Gods and\nGiants), the Stranger tries to reconcile two extreme positions about\nbeing, one of which features separate, immaterial and unchanging forms.\n\n\nWhat should we think about forms of negations, such as the not-large\nand the not-beautiful? Aristotle criticized Plato for commitment to\nsuch forms (Metaphysics A.9, 990b), but notoriously Aristotle\nwas not always fair in his criticisms. The Sophist explicitly\nspeaks of the form of not-being (Sophist 258d: to\neidos\u2026tou m\u00ea ontos), and a number of scholars regard the\nnot-large and the not-beautiful as forms (e.g., Moravcsik 1962, Frede\n1967, 92\u201394, Szaif 1996, 439\u201345, Crivelli 2012,\n204\u201314). The Stranger\u2019s lecture on parts and kinds in the\nStatesman, rejecting forms of barbarian and numbers other\nthan 10,000, poses a well-known problem for that view, yet as we saw\n(\u00a7 7.1 above) the lecture and second stage of the dichotomous\ndivision are themselves puzzling. Not only that: the Stranger warns\nYoung Socrates not to think he has heard anything clear from him about\nthe difference between a kind and a part (Statesman\n263b). This warning could strengthen the hand of those who attribute\nto Plato a commitment to forms of negations. One question we should be\nasking, though: what function(s) do Platonic forms perform? Does Plato\nneed a form whenever people call several things by the same name (as\nstated perhaps at Republic 10.596a)? Or does he invoke only\nthose forms needed to explain the features of things? In the latter\ncase, perhaps he can do without a form of the not-large, because he\ncan explain that range of sizes by appeal to the form of largeness and the\nform of not-being. Perhaps he needs no form of mud/clay (rejected by\nSocrates as a separate form at Parmenides 130c\u2013e),\nsince he can explain the mixture by appeal to forms of its\ningredients, earth and water, and the ratio of their combination\n(Parmenides 130c, with Theaetetus\n147a\u2013c). Questions about the scope of forms in Plato remain far\nfrom settled.\n\n\nIn addition to categorial kinds such as the sophist and statesman, there\nare also the great kinds discussed in the \nSophist\u2014change, rest, being, sameness, and difference. \nThese kinds were embraced in the Parmenides (esp. \nParmenides 130b), but they seem markedly \ndifferent from ordinary kinds like the sophist and statesman. The \nvowel forms\u2014being, sameness, and difference\u2014appear to \nstructure other kinds, enabling them to be what they are and to \nrelate to one another. Dialectic aims to discover and articulate \nthose structures. Structural kinds are closely tied to dialectic, as \nParmenides foretold, but both forms and dialectic seem to have \ndeveloped apace since the Phaedo and the Republic.\n",
