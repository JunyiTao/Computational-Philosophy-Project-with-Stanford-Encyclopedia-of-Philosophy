    "main_text": "Styles of Medieval Philosophy || University Philosophy\n2.7 University Philosophy\n\nBy about 1200, the Paris schools had become a university, and at much\nthe same time a university developed at Oxford. Universities were\nsplit into Arts Faculties and the higher Faculties of Theology, Law\nand\n Medicine.[18]\n Arts Faculties had by far the most students, and those who studied\nthe higher disciplines were older and had usually been trained in the\nArts Faculty or its equivalent. Grammar and logic were studied there\nfrom the beginning, but, as translations of the complete Aristotle\ngradually became available in the course of the thirteenth century,\nafter some decades of ecclesiastical opposition, Arts Faculties became\nin effect Aristotelian Faculties, with the curriculum divided up\naccording to his texts. Although universities were under the aegis of\nthe Church, study in the Arts Faculties was supposed to be limited to\nnatural knowledge, of which Aristotle, a pagan, was considered by\nalmost all to be the supreme representative. Discussion of revealed\ntruth\u2014in a highly argumentative manner, with many purely\nphilosophical digressions\u2014took place in the Theology Faculties,\nwhich quickly came to be dominated by Franciscan and Dominican\nfriars.\n\nIn the mid-thirteenth century, university philosophers were enthused\nby the newly available Aristotelian material, complimented by\nAvicenna\u2019s presentations and understood with the aid of\nAverroes\u2019s\n commentaries.[19]\n The two most famous Parisian Arts masters, Siger of Brabant and\n Boethius of Dacia,\n working in the 1260 and 1270s, tried to develop Aristotelianism\nwithin its own terms, not merely independently of revealed doctrine\n(as they were required to do in the Faculty of Arts), but also\nirrespective of whether it contradicted Christian teaching. The\nDominican theologian\n Thomas Aquinas\n (1225\u201374) was no less enthusiastic an Aristotelian, but he had\nan almost unlimited confidence that Aristotle had reached\ndemonstrative conclusions which must, therefore, be true and, equally,\nbecause true, not be in contradiction with Christian doctrine (though\nChristian doctrine also included elements that could not be known\nexcept through revelation)\n (\u00a73.1,\n \u00a73.3). Siger and Boethius of Dacia were among the targets of a\ncondemnation directed by the Bishop of Paris in 1277 (see entry on the\n Condemnation of 1277)\n against thinkers in the university. Aquinas, recently dead, did not\nescape completely, and he remained a controversial figure, though an\nauthority for Dominicans (see also\n Aquinas\u2019s moral, political, and legal philosophy).\n\nIn the next generation,\n Henry of Ghent\n (d. 1293), a member of the commission that drew up the condemnations,\nwas the most influential Paris theologian. But it was\n John Duns Scotus\n (1265/5\u20131308), an Oxford Franciscan who was then sent to teach\nat Paris, who transformed the subject. He thoroughly absorbed\nAristotelianism, but held that Aristotle\u2019s conception of God was\nwrong, because it did not allow for divine choices\n (\u00a73.2).\n He rejected the Aristotelian conception of modality\n (\u00a73.2),\n stressed divine omnipotence and made divine will the determinant of\ngood and evil. In his metaphysics, he introduced a range of subtle\ndistinctions, vastly complicating the Aristotelian scheme.\n William of Ockham\n (c. 1287\u20131347), a Franciscan theologian who worked at Oxford\nand London before joining the Emperor, Ludwig of Bavaria, in order to\nflee a papal investigation, followed Scotus\u2019s line on\nGod\u2019s will, but substituted for his metaphysics a very sparse\nontology in which the distinctions Scotus had thrust on reality are\nmade through a mental language. Ockham was also a dedicated logician,\nand he and his brilliant Oxford generation made great use of logical\nand linguistic analysis, not unlike Abelard and the twelfth-century\nParis thinkers\n (\u00a74.2).\n In Paris,\n John Buridan\n (d. 1360), the leading Arts Master for decades, and an outstanding\nlogician, followed a similar programme, and, as an Aristotelian\ncommentator, strove to be at once faithful to the pagan texts and yet\nrespect the ultimate truth of Christian doctrine.\n\nAlthough most accounts of Latin university philosophy tail off in the\nmid-fourteenth century, this style of philosophizing continued\nvigorously for at least three centuries\n (\u00a75.2),\n and in this period universities were established all over Europe.\nLate in the fourteenth century, John Wyclif (d. 1384), trained at\nOxford, elaborated a sophisticated and idiosyncratic system of\nphilosophy and theology, aspects of which were taken up by\n Paul of Venice\n (d. 1429), the greatest logician of his time. The Arts Faculties of\nItalian universities flourished especially in the late fifteenth and\nsixteenth centuries;\n Pietro Pomponazzi\n (1462\u20131525) was the most famous of these teachers, and the most\naudacious in defending the prerogative of Arts Masters to expound the\ngenuine thought of Aristotle, whatever its differences from Christian\ndoctrine\n (\u00a73.3).\n This tradition of university philosophy continued for nearly two more\ncenturies, with thinkers like\n Giacomo Zabarella\n (d. 1589) in Italy and a host of important figures in Spain and\nPortugal\n (\u00a75.2).\n",
