    "main_text": "\n\nDavid Hume\u2019s views on aesthetic theory and the philosophy of art\nare to be found in his work on moral theory and in several essays.\nAlthough there is a tendency to emphasize the two essays devoted to\nart, \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d and \u201cOf\nTragedy,\u201d his views on art and aesthetic judgment are intimately\nconnected to his moral philosophy and theories of human thought and\nemotion. His theory of taste and beauty is not entirely original, but\nhis arguments generally display the keen analysis typical of his best\nwork. Hume\u2019s archaic terminology is occasionally an obstacle to\nappreciating his analysis, inviting conflicting readings of his\nposition. \n",
