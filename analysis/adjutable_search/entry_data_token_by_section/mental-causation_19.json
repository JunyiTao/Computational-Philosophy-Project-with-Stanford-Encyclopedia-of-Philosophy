    "main_text": "Problem III: Exclusion || Inheritance Solutions\n6.4 Inheritance Solutions\n\nAutonomy solutions can make it appear that the causal powers of mental\nproperties \u201cfloat free\u201d of their physical realizers,\nbringing to mind the doctrine of parallelism (for replies, see\nThomasson 1998; Marcus 2001, \u00a73.3). Some non-reductive\nphysicalists have accordingly looked to tie the causal powers of\nmental properties more closely to those of their physical realizers.\nThe idea is that mental properties are so intimately related to their\nrealizers that the former \u201cinherit\u201d the causal powers of\nthe latter. The relation between levels is not one of rivalry, such\nthat the physical might exclude the mental, but one of cooperation.\nNor, moreover, does there seem to be any threat of overdetermination,\nsince the mental works through the physical. (Compare the\nmetaphor of \u201ctransparency\u201d in Jackson 1996.)\n\nOn some versions of the inheritance solution, what the higher-level\nmental property derives from its physical realizer is some weaker or\n\u201clower-grade\u201d form of causal relevance. For example,\nJackson and Pettit (1988, 1990) distinguish the robust \u201ccausal\nefficacy\u201d of physical properties from the weaker \u201ccausal\nrelevance\u201d of higher-level properties. Causal relevance in this\nsense is an explanatory notion: as one might put it, behavior is\nproduced at the physical level, but by being realized in the\nphysical, mental properties inherit an explanatory relevance they\nwouldn\u2019t have otherwise. An advantage of such a view is that it\naccords a derived form of relevance to mental properties, but in a way\nthat respects both the priority of physical causation embodied in\nCompleteness as well as the principle of No\nOverdetermination. (For similar views, see Kim 1984; Levine 2001,\n\u00a71.5; Segal 2009. Those who appeal to the counterfactual\ndependence of behavior on the mental [\u00a75.3] might also fall into\nthis category. For an answer to the charge that counterfactual\ndependence is \u201ccausation lite\u201d, see Loewer 2007, Menzies\n2007.)\n\nIf such a weakening seems to amount to epiphenomenalism, you might\nlook for an inheritance solution on which mental properties are\nefficacious in the same sense that their physical realizers are\n(compare the \u201chomogeneity assumption\u201d in Crane 1995). How\ncan this be done without violating No Overdetermination?\nWell, suppose that a mental property is, in spite of being distinct\nfrom its physical realizer, immanent in this realizer;\nM, that is, is somehow nothing over and above P. In\nthat case, any causal work done by P is, in a straightforward\nway, inherited by M. Overdetermination is avoided because\nM\u2019s work is included in P\u2019s.\n\nThe metaphysical details of such a picture matter. Otherwise,\n\u201cimmanence\u201d, \u201cnothing over and above\u201d, and the\nlike will turn into mere labels for that psychophysical relation, we\nknow not what, that solves the Exclusion Problem. Accordingly, several\npromising lines of inquiry have been pursued. Mental and physical\nproperties are said to be related by, for example, the\ndeterminable\u2013determinate relation (Yablo 1992; critics include\nEhring 1996; Worley 1997; Funkhouser 2006), constitution (Pereboom\n2002; critics include Ney 2007; Heil 2011), metaphysical necessitation\n(Bennett 2003, 2008), physical explicability (Antony 1991), physical\nimplementation (Marras 2003), and grounding (Kroedel and Schulz\n2016).\n\nYou might ask why any of these relations should secure the desired\nsolution. One thought is that if mental properties are immanent in\ntheir physical realizers, the causal powers of a mental property are\nincluded among those of its realizer. Consider again mental property\nM and one of its realizers in a given instance, P.\nPlausibly, M\u2019s powers are included in\nP\u2019s. Both properties, for example, have the power to\ncause a certain kind of behavior, but because of its greater\n\u201cspecificity\u201d, P has in addition to this powers\nthat M lacks. Now in general we don\u2019t think that wholes\ncausally compete with, or are excluded by, their parts. When Gus steps\non Lilian\u2019s toe, his foot\u2019s causing Lilian discomfort\ndoesn\u2019t exclude Gus\u2019s causing her discomfort. Both Gus and\nhis foot coexist as causes, without competition and, we might add,\nwithout overdetermination. A similar point could be made about\nproperties: if the causal powers of M are included in those\nbestowed by P, then P\u2019s causal relevance to\nbehavior, far from excluding M\u2019s, includes it.\n(Approaches along these lines have been developed in Antony 1999;\nShoemaker 2001, 2007; Wilson 1999, 2011; Clapp 2001; critical\ndiscussions include Heil 1999, 2011; McLaughlin 2007; Kim 2010; Ney\n2010; Audi 2012.)\n",
