But certain puzzle\ncases challenge this assumption. These puzzles are of interest in\ntheir own right, but they feature in this article because, as with the\nproblem of change, perdurantists have argued that believing in\ntemporal parts is the best way to solve the puzzles. And, as with the\nproblem of change, endurantists may reply that temporal parts\ndon\u2019t help, or that there is a perfectly good endurantist\nalternative, or both.\n",
