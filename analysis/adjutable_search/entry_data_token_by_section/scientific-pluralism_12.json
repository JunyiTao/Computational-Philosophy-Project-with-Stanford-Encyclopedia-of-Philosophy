    "main_text": "The Social Organization of Science || Feminist Philosophy of Science and Epistemic Diversity\n5.2 Democratization and Governance of Science\n\nTraditional perspectives on science as self-regulating through\npolitically neutral epistemic norms (Merton 1942; Wilholt 2012)\nsuggest that research requires little governance. For example,\nBush\u2019s (1945) government report Science\u2014The Endless\nFrontier has been widely portrayed as a landmark for American\nscience policy after World War II that treated science as a neutral\nand objective foundation from which applied technologies and\ncommercial innovations derive. While North American philosophy of\nscience largely adopted this depoliticized vision of science (Reisch\n2005), scientific pluralism can be positioned in a wider intellectual\nshift of rethinking the relation between science and society that has\nbeen driven by the rapid technological and scientific transformation\nof post-war societies including their existential risks from\nindustrial disasters in Bhopal or Chernobyl to public controversies\nabout genetic modification or climate change (Macnaghten 2020).\n\nIn philosophy of science, Kitcher\u2019s (2001, 2011) model of\nwell-ordered science provides an influential proposal for aligning\nscience and society through democratic negotiation of agenda setting\nand application. Rather than endorsing direct democratic control of\nscientific agendas through voting, Kitcher imagines an idealized\ndeliberative process that involves a public that is tutored by the\nrelevant scientific evidence and pluralistic in a fair representation\nof sometimes incompatible preferences of stakeholders. Well-ordered\nscience therefore aims to articulate a \u201cthird way\u201d\n(Kitcher 2002) between pathologies of direct democratic control of\nscience and an expert-driven technocracy that separates science from\nsociety.\n\nWhile the moderate pluralism of well-ordered science has been widely\ndiscussed in philosophy (Cartwright 2006; Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto 2015;\nKusch 2020b; Van Bouwel 2009), its highly idealized model of public\ndeliberation has only limited appeal to science governance scholars\nwho have become more closely aligned with science and technology\nstudies (STS) and research on public deliberation under non-ideal\nconditions (Hagendijk & Irwin 2006; Kearnes 2009). One major\ncontribution from STS is the notion of \u201csociotechnical\nimaginaries\u201d that approaches scientific agendas not through\nideal deliberation but heterogeneous national cultures of imagining\nand negotiating futures (Jasanoff & Kim 2009). In their\ncomparative study of nuclear energy in the US and South Korea, for\nexample, Jasanoff and Kim argue that the American imaginary reflects a\ndiscourse of containment between the potentials of nuclear superpower\nand its existential risks, while the South Korean imaginary\nincorporated nuclear energy into a narrative of scientific and\ntechnological progress in the ascent of an \u201cunderdeveloped\nnation\u201d into a modern society. Thinking about the international\nplurality of scientific agendas through sociotechnical imaginaries\ntherefore challenges scientific pluralists to address democratization\nnot merely as an ideal in which all preferences and stakeholders are\nequally represented but as a non-ideal process that unfolds in\ninteraction with heterogeneous discourses, identities, institutions,\nand technologies.\n\nIn science governance, \u201cresponsible research and\ninnovation\u201d (RRI) has emerged as an increasingly influential\napproach for addressing stakeholder plurality and public deliberation\nunder such non-ideal conditions (Doezema et al. 2019; von Schomberg\n2013; Wittrock et al. 2021). RRI approaches such as the AIRR framework\naim to align science and society through governance that is oriented\nthrough four dimensions of\n\n(A) anticipation,\n(I) inclusion,\n(R) reflexivity and\n(R) responsiveness. (Stilgoe, Owen, & Macnaghten 2013)\n\n\nFor example, anticipatory exercises such as scenario building and\nreflexive practices such as focus group discussions aim to open-up\nimagination about different scientific agendas. Inclusion is\napproached through a wide variety of institutional mechanisms from\naffirmative action to open access requirements as well as inclusive\nstrategies of organizing research processes through citizen science,\nparticipatory research, or transdisciplinarity.\n\nWhile philosophers of science have increasingly turned to science\ngovernance (Douglas 2009; Eigi 2017; Tuana 2010), it remains\ncontentious how far pluralist demands for diversity, participation,\nand representation should reach. Science governance comes with\nheterogenous perspectives on public engagement and inclusion\n(Macnaghten 2020). For example, \u201cgrand challenges\u201d models\nin science governance emphasize the crucial role of science in\naddressing pressing societal problems from climate change to food\nsecurity to public health (Efstathiou 2016). While grand challenges\nmodels include diverse publics in the agenda setting of science, they\ntend to leave the epistemic core of scientific knowledge production to\nscientists as long as they adhere with socially negotiated ethical\nconstraints. Debates about well-ordered science can often be\ninterpreted along grand challenges science that articulates pluralist\nperspectives on public deliberation for early stages of agenda setting\nand final stages of application but not for the research process\nitself. In this sense, Longino (2002b: 574) argues that \u201cKitcher\nwants to democratize science policy, not science\u201d.\n\nIn contrast, \u201cco-production\u201d models (Macnaghten 2020)\nreflect a more radically pluralist tradition in STS that emphasizes\nthe inseparability of epistemic and social aspects of research. For\nexample, Jasanoff and Simmet\u2019s (2017) co-production model argues\nthat not only scientific agendas and applications but also scientific\nfacts have to be understood as normative in public. According to\nJasanoff and Simmet, public facts always interact with social\nnegotiations of whose realities and values matter, what can be\ncontested in a democratic process, and what can be articulated in a\ngiven sociotechnical imaginary. While these points resonate with\nstandpoint theory (Wylie 2003) and feminist empiricism (Longino 2002a)\nas described in the previous section, many of these connections remain\nimplicit and point towards a challenge of a more explicit integration\nof pluralist philosophy of science with interdisciplinary research in\nscience governance.\n",
