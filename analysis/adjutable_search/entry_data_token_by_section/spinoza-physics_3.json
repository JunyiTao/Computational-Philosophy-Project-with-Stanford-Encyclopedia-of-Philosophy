    "main_text": "Physical cartesianism and the consequences of metaphysical divergence || The principle of least modal mutation\n3.2 The principle of least modal mutation\n\nThis divergence over the possible metaphysical grounds for natural\nlaws and collision rules is important for understanding what is\nfundamentally at stake in another of Spinoza's supplements to what\nDescartes had himself offered in his Principles of\nPhilosophy. In a letter to Clerselier, Descartes makes clear that\nof all of his rules of collision \u201cdepend on only a\nsingle principle, which is that when two bodies collide, and have in\nthem incompatible modes, there must undoubtedly occur some mutation of\nthese modes to make them compatible, but this mutation is always the\nleast possible\u201d (Descartes 1964\u201374: V, 185, emphasis\nadded). Following Gabbey (1996), call this the \u201cPrinciple of\nLeast Modal Mutation\u201d (PLMM). Despite is importance, Descartes\nneither mentions the PLMM is his Principles, nor offers a\njustification for it in the letter to Clerselier or elsewhere.\n\nIn the PCP, Spinoza includes the principle Descartes left\nout, and offers the demonstration Descartes never attempted.\nPCP IIp23 states: \u201cWhen the modes of a body are forced\nto undergo variation, that variation will always be the least that can\nbe.\u201d The demonstration consists of a concise and exclusive\nappeal to PCP IIp14, Spinoza's rendering of Descartes' law of\ninertia, according to which \u201cEach single thing, insofar as it is\nsimple and undivided and is considered only in itself, always\nperseveres in the same state, as far as it can\u201d. But just as\nDescartes never explains why the PLMM is true, Spinoza never explains\nwhy the principle of inertia supports the PLMM. Moreover, as\nformulated in PCP IIp14, it seems prima facie\ninadequate to do so. PCP IIp14 speaks of what happens to a\nbody only as it is considered in itself, simple and\nundivided, whereas PCP IIp23 speaks of bodies undergoing\nvariation imposed by other bodies, and is not limited to simple and\nundivided bodies. And even supposing PCP IIp14 relevant to\nwhat goes on with bodies when considered as affected by other bodies,\nit does not give any obvious guidance as to what then occurs. It seems\non the face of it quite possible that the least total modal variation\ncommanded by PCP IIp23 might involve a greater variation on\nthe part of each of the colliding bodies than would be consistent with\neither body in question persevering in its state as far as it can on\nits own. We are of course told they always remain in the same state\n\u201cas far as they can.\u201d But for this qualification to be of\nany relevance, it will obviously have to mean \u201cas far as they\ncan, in the face of the influence of external bodies\u201d; but until\nwe know the content of the collision laws, we are not entitled to say\nhow the influence of external bodies affects a body's inertial\ntendency. Yet it is just this content we need PCP IIp23 to\nderive.\n\nHow, then, might inertia be understood so that it supports the PLMM?\nIn good rationalist fashion, we should expect to come to a sound\nunderstanding of the principle of inertia by attending to the grounds\nfrom which it follows. But just as in the case of the Cartesian\nconservation law, Spinoza cannot himself have accepted the Cartesian\nstrategy of grounding inertia in the immutability of God's will.\nSpinoza offers his own principle of inertia in the so-called\n\u201cphysical interlude\u201d of the Ethics, at IIp13 L3C:\n\u201ca body in motion moves until it is determined by another body\nto rest; and a body at rest also remains at rest until it is\ndetermined to motion by another\u201d. Rather than appealing to\ndivine will, Spinoza's demonstration of this principle seems to\nproceed from causal rationalism alone.\n\nWhen I suppose, for example that a body A is at rest and I give no\nconsideration to other moving bodies, I can assert nothing about body\nA but that it is at rest. Now if it should thereafter happen that body\nA is in motion, this surely could not have resulted from the fact that\nit was at rest; for from that fact nothing else could have followed\nthan that body A should be at rest.\n\n\nSince nothing in the conception of a thing as moving or at rest,\nwithout regard to other things, could explain a change in its motion\nor rest, something outside that conception is required to do so. This\ndemonstration cites no previous propositions or axioms of the\nEthics; indeed Spinoza claims his principle of inertia is\n\u201cself-evident\u201d.\n\nBut it would be unsatisfying to take inertia as primitive\u2014to say\nthat bodies in fact do tend to persist in their states, though there\nis no reason to be discerned in their nature why they do so. To say\nthis would be to take it that Spinoza accepted the Cartesian principle\nas Descartes understood it, while rejecting the grounds Descartes\noffered for it, and without providing any substitute for it. This is\ndissonant indeed with the general tenor of Spinoza's\n rationalism.[4]\n Moreover, on this view, Spinoza would have taken the trouble to make\nexplicit the PLMM Descartes' rules require, only to justify it by a\ndirect and unelaborated appeal to a groundless principle of inertia,\nwhich seems, on Descartes' understanding of it, quite inadequate to do\nthe job. Yet Spinoza evidently did think that the PLMM followed from\nthe principle of inertia. This suggests that he had a different\nconception than did Descartes of both the nature and ground of that\nprinciple.\n",
