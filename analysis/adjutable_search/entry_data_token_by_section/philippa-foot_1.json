Ethical Naturalism in Foot\u2019s Early Writings\n\nIn a trio of early articles, Foot argues against then prevailing views\non the nature of moral judgments and sketches an alternative positive\nview. The views she argued against were known as emotivism and\nprescriptivism, both versions of noncognitivism. On these views, moral\njudgments feature a special attitudinal component, a pro or con\nattitude that is absent from straightforward descriptive claims. What\nthe judgments are about is irrelevant to whether they count as moral\njudgments. In \u201cMoral Arguments\u201d (1958), Foot memorably\npresents these views as offering a \u201cprivate enterprise theory of\nmoral criteria\u201d, which highlights the way in which these views\ntake the individual\u2019s attitude as settling the question of the\nscope of morality (1958 [VV 108]). In this line of argument, she demonstrates\na commitment to a Wittgensteinian approach and takes up some of\nWittgenstein\u2019s views. The idea that terms must have public\ncriteria and cannot be given arbitrary meaning by the individual\nspeaker is among these commitments, along with the approach to\ninvestigating terms by way of a \u2018grammatical\ninvestigation\u2019. That is an attempt to ground our understanding\nof words in an examination of how we in fact use them when we are\npractically engaged, which often gets lost when doing philosophy.\n\nThe noncognitivist views Foot attacks depend on a pair of assumptions\nthat Foot dismantles in her article \u201cMoral Beliefs\u201d\n(1959). The first assumption is that what counts as evidence for an\nevaluative conclusion in no way depends on what anyone else counts as\nevidence. Foot thinks this would only be possible if the meaning of a\nterm such as \u2018good\u2019 possesses a separate evaluative\ncomponent, independent of any consideration of the proper object of\nthings deemed good. The second assumption is that anyone can refuse to\ndraw an evaluative conclusion in the face of what others regard as\ndefinitive evidence. For example, one guided by this assumption might\nadmit that there are grounds for calling Jones courageous, in that he\ndefended his family against a fearsome attacker, but refuse to praise\nJones for his courage. In that case, one might say he is\n\u2018courageous\u2019 only in a descriptive, inverted commas sense,\navoiding the evaluative commitment that this description usually\nentails. Together, these assumptions erect a wall between factual\njudgments and evaluative judgments, a wall which Foot proceeds to\ndemolish.\n\nAgainst the first assumption, Foot argues that the term\n\u2018good\u2019 is analogous to \u2018pride\u2019 in having\nlimits on its intelligible use. The analogy draws on the fact that the\nemotion of pride is evaluative, and yet tied to definite descriptive\ncontent: logically, one cannot feel pride about just anything. Rather,\nto feel pride in something is to see it as one\u2019s achievement;\nhence the object of pride is taken to a good that one had some hand in\nbringing about. For example, if I thought I had been awarded the prize\nfor best pumpkin and felt proud of this triumph, but it turned out\nthat it was in fact someone else\u2019s pumpkin which actually won, I\ncould not intelligibly continue to feel pride. Further, what one takes\npride in must be some sort of achievement or advantage. It would not\nmake sense to feel pride in laying one hand over another three times\nin an hour, unless there is a special background condition, such as a\nstroke, which made this a difficult task and an important step in\nrecovery. Foot argues thereby that to be said to be feeling certain\nemotions, it is not sufficient that one be in a certain mental\nstate.[1]\nRather, the person must stand in an appropriate relationship to a\nproper object of those feelings. In this way, Foot attempts to show\nthat \u201ceven feelings are logically vulnerable to facts\u201d\n(1959 [VV 115]).\n\nAnalogously, she thinks someone must stand in an appropriate relation\nto a proper object of \u2018good\u2019 to be said to think something\nis good. Foot asks us to consider someone who deems it good to always\nclasp one\u2019s hands three times in an hour. This person might\nclaim it is a duty to so clasp one\u2019s hands, praise others for\ndoing it and so on. Are these moral judgments? She maintains that to\ncall these moral judgments would require a special background; in this\ncase, the clasper\u2019s belief that such action has special\nsignificance or effect that pertains to the human good (1959 [VV\n120]). Foot contends that there is a logical impossibility in taking\nthe clasping to be morally good in the absence of any such\nbackground.\n\nAgainst the second assumption, that we might fail to draw an\nevaluative conclusion from what others regard as definitive evidence,\nFoot argues in \u201cMoral Beliefs\u201d that we all have reason to\nact in view of what is demonstrated to be in our interests. If an\naction can be shown to be in our interests, we have reason to do it.\nSo, one can say, at least pro tanto, that we ought to do it,\nand would be irrational and bad not to do it, all else being equal.\nFoot then aims to show that cultivating the virtues is always in\none\u2019s interest, and failing to do so is necessarily against\none\u2019s interest. She thereby claims to show that we each have\nreason to cultivate the virtues, regardless of our present desires. In\nthe course of her argument, she attempts to refute the position\nadvocated by Thrasymachus in Plato\u2019s Republic, namely,\nthe view that it is more profitable to be unjust, a view which she\ncalls \u201cThrasymachus\u2019 thesis\u201d (1959 [VV 125]). So,\nshe aims to persuade us that justice, along with the other so-called\n\u2018cardinal virtues\u2019 of courage, prudence, and temperance,\nare in some sense profitable, even though these virtues may at times\nask us to make drastic sacrifices, even to the point of laying down\nour lives.\n\nFoot compares injustice with physical injury, focusing primarily on an\ninjury to our limbs. She believes that an injury, which impairs the\nfunctioning of some part of our bodies or creates lasting pain, is\nsomething we each have reason to avoid. That is, we want to avoid it\nfor itself, even though some circumstance may arise where there is a\nreason to want to sustain an injury because of some advantage which\ncan be realized through it (or, more commonly, we want to do something\nthat risks sustaining injury for the sake of some advantage).\nIn such circumstances, we can say that there are overriding or all\nthings considered reasons to sustain or risk an injury, but clearly,\nwe would avoid the injury if the gain could be realized without\nsustaining it. No rational person seeks an injury for itself, and\nevery rational person avoids injury for itself. An injury is something\nthat we should always want to avoid because it is a physical change\nwhich impairs the function of a particular body part, and we all have\nreason to want our bodies to function properly (1959 [VV\n116\u2013117; 122]). General facts concerning human beings support\nthe idea that it is necessary for rational people to want their limbs\nintact.\n\nSimilarly, she thinks that there are features of human life which\nexplain why it is rationally necessary for us to want the virtues. She\nargues that the virtues can be taken to be as essential to the\nfulfillment of our desires as are our limbs. Though we may choose to\nlive a life in isolation, or indeed though we may be stranded in\ninvoluntary isolation for any of various reasons, we are creatures who\ncan at present anticipate that our attempts at attaining things will\nhappen in a social environment. This means that we are creatures for\nwhom it is a constant fact that our attempts at fulfilling a desire\nmay be interfered with or enhanced by others. We can all expect to\nprofit if our actions instance a practice which is defined by mutual\nrespect and fidelity to promises, and this profit is one we all have\nreason to want given that our desiring things predictably occurs\nwithin a social matrix.\n\nFoot recognized one of the most obvious objections to this position,\nwhich is the \u2018tight corner\u2019. That is, while it may be\ngenerally beneficial to be just or courageous, in individual\ncircumstances it is difficult to claim that someone has reason to be\nvirtuous when, in doing so, they would incur a very great loss. On\nthis objection, it would seem rational to avoid developing the\ndisposition to be just in order to avoid incurring these losses. In\n\u201c Moral Beliefs\u201d Foot argued that by concentrating on the\ncosts of particular just acts in isolation, this object fails to\nrecognize the value of the general disposition to be just (1959 [VV\n129\u201330]). But later she cites the objection as a reason for her\nchange of view in \u201cMorality as a System of Hypothetical\nImperatives\u201d (VV x). Ultimately, the successful defense of her\nearly position on the rationality of morality depends on defending the\nview that we should not be focusing on the rationality of individual\nactions, but rather the rationality of adopting the disposition to be\njust.[2]\n\nIn arguing against her emotivist and prescriptivist opponents, Foot\ndevelops the outlines of a positive position that should be labeled a\nversion of ethical naturalism in view of the role that it accords\nfacts about human life in defining the content of morality. In\n\u201cWhen is a Principle a Moral Principle?\u201d (1954),\n\u201cMoral Arguments\u201d, and \u201cMoral Beliefs\u201d, Foot\nmakes a case for a distinctive non-utilitarian naturalistic ethics in\nwhich the virtues play a central role and in which a trait is\njustified as a virtue by making a contribution to leading a good human\nlife. Her case for such an ethics is motivated by metaethical\nconcerns, specifically with her dissatisfaction regarding the ability\nof noncognitivist theories to offer an adequate account of\nmorality.\n",
