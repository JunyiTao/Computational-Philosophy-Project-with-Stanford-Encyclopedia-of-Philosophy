    "main_text": "The Structure of the Rhetoric\n2. The Structure of the Rhetoric\n\nThe structure of Rhetoric I & II is determined by two\ntripartite divisions. The first division consists in the distinction\nbetween the three pisteis, i.e. \u2018persuaders\u2019 or\n\u2018means of persuasion\u2019, that are technical in the sense\nthat they are based on the rhetorical method and are provided by the\nspeech alone. And speech can produce persuasion either through the\ncharacter (\u00eathos) of the speaker, the emotional state\n(pathos) of the listener, or the argument (logos)\nitself (see below\n \u00a7 5).\n The second tripartite division concerns the three species or genres\nof public speech (see de Brauw 2008 and Pepe 2013). A speech that\ntakes place in the assembly is defined as a deliberative\nspeech. In this rhetorical genre, the speaker either advises the\naudience to do something or warns against doing something.\nAccordingly, the audience has to judge things that are going to happen\nin the future, and they have to decide whether these future events are\ngood or bad for the city or city-state (polis), whether they\nwill cause advantage or harm. A speech that takes place before a court\nis defined as a judicial speech. The speaker either accuses\nsomebody or defends herself or someone else. Naturally, this kind of\nspeech treats things that happened in the past. The audience, or\nrather the jury, has to judge whether a past event actually happened\nor not and whether it was just or unjust, i.e., whether it was in\naccordance with the law or contrary to the law. While the deliberative\nand judicial genres have their context in controversial situations in\nwhich the listener has to decide in favour of one of two opposing\nparties, the third genre does not aim at such a decision: an\nepideictic speech (e.g. funeral speeches, celebratory\nspeeches) praises or blames somebody, and tries to describe the\naffairs or deeds of its subject as honourable or shameful.\n\nThe first book of the Rhetoric treats these three genres in\nsuccession. Rhetoric I.4\u20138 deals with the deliberative,\nI.9 with the epideictic, I.10\u201314 with the judicial genre. These\nchapters are understood as contributing to the argumentative mode of\npersuasion (logos) or \u2014 more precisely \u2014 to that\npart of argumentative persuasion that is specific to the respective\ngenre of speech. The second part of the treatment of argumentative\npersuasion (logos) that is common to all three genres of\nrhetorical speech is treated in chapters II.19\u201326. The second\nmeans of persuasion, the one that works by evoking the emotions of the\naudience (pathos), is described in chapters II.2\u201311.\nAlthough the following chapters II.12\u201317 treat different types\nof character (\u00eathos), these chapters do not, as one\nmight infer, develop the first means of persuasion, i.e. the one that\ndepends on the character of the speaker. The underlying theory of this\nmeans of persuasion is rather unfolded in a few lines of chapter II.1.\nThe aforementioned chapters II.12\u201317 rather account for\ndifferent types of character and their disposition to emotional\nresponse, which can be useful for speakers who want to arouse the\nemotions of the audience. Why the chapters on the specific (in the\nfirst book) and the common (in the second book) argumentative means of\npersuasion (logos) are separated by the treatment of emotions\nand character (in II.2\u201317) remains a riddle, especially since\nthe chapter II.18 tries to give a link between the specific and the\ncommon aspects of argumentative persuasion \u2014 as though this\nchapter follows directly upon the end of Rhetoric I.\nRhetoric III.1\u201312 discusses several questions of style\n(see below\n \u00a7 8.1)\n while Rhetoric III.13\u201319 is dedicated to the various\nparts of a speech and their arrangement.\n\nOwing to ambiguities like these, the structuring of the\nRhetoric has always been somewhat controversial, since\ndifferent attempts to structure the work manifest different\ninterpretative decisions. By and large, though, the following\nstructure seems to capture its main topics and divisions:\n\nRhetoric I \n\n\nCh. 1: Rhetoric as a counterpart to dialectic \u2014\ndialectically conceived rhetoric is centred on proofs \u2014\nrhetorical proofs are \u2018enthymemes\u2019 \u2014 this is\nneglected by previous manuals of rhetoric that focus instead on\nemotions, slandering and on other techniques for speaking outside the\nsubject \u2014 \u201cspeaking outside the subject\u201d is\nforbidden in states with good legislation \u2014 the benefits of\nrhetoric.\nCh. 2: Rhetoric is the capacity to discern the available\npersuasive potential in any given case \u2014 means of persuasion\n(pisteis) based on the art (techn\u00ea) of\nrhetoric vs. artless means of persuasion \u2014 of the art-based\nmeans of persuasion (pisteis) there are three types:\n\n\nThrough the speaker: credibility of the speaker\n(\u00eathos)\nThrough the hearer: the emotional state of the audience\n(pathos)\nThrough the argument: proving or seemingly proving what is true\n(logos)\n Deductive and inductive types of rhetorical arguments \u2014\nthe enthymeme as the deductive type of rhetorical argument \u2014\npeculiarities of rhetorical arguments \u2014 enthymemes from\nprobabilities and signs \u2014 the technique of topoi\n\u2014 the difference between generally applicable and specific\ntopoi.\nCh. 3: There are three genres of public speech:\n\n\nJudicial (or forensic) speech deals with accusation and defence\nabout past events \u2014 aiming at the just/unjust.\nDeliberative (or political) speech deals with exhortation and\ndissuasion about future events \u2014 aiming at the\nadvantageous/harmful.\nEpideictic speech deals with praise and blame primarily with\nregard to the present time \u2014 aiming at the\nhonourable/shameful.\n \nCh. 4\u20138: Premises or topoi specific to the\ndeliberative speech: Types of advantageous/harmful things the speaker\nshould be familiar with (Ch. 4) \u2014 Happiness\n(eudaimonia) (Ch. 5) \u2014 what is good/advantageous (Ch.\n6) \u2014 what is better/more advantageous (Ch. 7) \u2014 the\nvarious constitutions (Ch. 8).\nCh. 9: Premises or topoi specific to the epideictic\nspeech: virtue and vice \u2014 the honourable and the\nblameworthy.\nCh. 10\u201314: Premises or topoi specific to the\njudicial speech: wrong-doing and motives for wrong-doing (Ch. 10)\n\u2014 pleasure (Ch. 11) \u2014 the state of mind of the wrong-doers\nand characteristics of their victims (Ch. 12) \u2014 kinds of just\nand unjust deeds, unwritten laws (Ch. 13) \u2014 degrees of\nwrong-doing (Ch. 14).\nCh. 15: Artless means of persuasion (i.e. means that cannot be\ninvented by the art, but are just given \u2014 such as contracts,\nlaws, witnesses, oaths, torture \u2014 and need to be used in one way\nor the other), mostly connected with judicial speech.\n\n\n\nRhetoric II\n\n\nCh. 1: Why persuasion through logos is insufficient\n\u2014 how persuasion through \u00eathos and\npathos is supposed to work.\nCh. 2\u201311: Particular types of emotions\n(path\u00ea) and their counterparts: anger (Ch. 2) \u2014\nmildness (Ch. 3) \u2014 loving/friendly affection (philia)\nand hating (Ch. 4) \u2014 fear and confidence (Ch. 5) \u2014 shame\nand lack of shame (Ch. 6) \u2014 gratefulness and lack of\ngratefulness (Ch. 7) \u2014 pity (Ch. 8) \u2014 indignation plus two\nnameless emotions (Ch. 9) \u2014 envy (Ch. 10) \u2014 emulation or\nambition (Ch.11).\nCh. 12\u201317: Different types of character\n(\u00eathos): the character of young people (Ch. 12), of\nelderly people (Ch. 13), of people in the prime of their life (Ch.\n14), of people of noble birth (Ch. 15), of wealthy people (Ch. 16) and\nof powerful people (Ch. 18).\nCh. 18: Transition to generally applicable aspects of persuasion\nthrough logos:\nCh. 19\u201325: Generally applicable aspects of persuasion\nthrough logos: topoi about the possible/impossible,\npast and future facts, significance and insignificance (Ch. 19)\n\u2014 examples: factual (report) and fictitious (the parable and the\nfable) (Ch. 20) \u2014 maxims (Ch. 21) \u2014 the enthymeme (Ch. 22)\n\u2014 topoi for the construction of enthymemes (Ch. 23)\n\u2014 topoi for the construction of merely apparent (i.e.\nfallacious) enthymemes (Ch. 24) \u2014 refutation (Ch. 25).\nCh. 26: Amplification \u2014 transition to Rhetoric\nIII.\n\n\n\nRhetoric III, Ch. 1\u201312: Style\n(lexis):\n\n\nCh. 1: Delivery of a speech and why style/diction should be\nconsidered.\nCh. 2\u20133: The virtue and the vices of prose style: the\nexcellent prose style is neither too banal nor above the due dignity,\nbut appropriate \u2014 the choice of words \u2014 the role of\nmetaphors (Ch. 2) \u2014 Four deterrent factors (or vices) of style\n(Ch. 3).\nCh. 4\u201311: Particular ingredients of prose style: the simile\n(Ch. 4) \u2014 linguistic correctness (Ch. 5) \u2014 stylistic\nvoluminousness and its contrary (Ch. 6) \u2014 appropriateness in\nstyle (Ch. 7) \u2014 periodic style (Ch. 8) \u2014 rhythm (Ch. 9)\n\u2014 urbanity, bringing before the eyes, metaphors (Ch.\n10\u201311).\nCh. 12: Written and oral style.\n\n\n\nRhetoric III, Ch. 13\u201319:\nArrangement (taxis):\n\n\nCh. 13: Only two parts of the speech are necessary, namely the\nstatement and the proof of the main claim \u2014 contemporary authors\nof rhetorical manuals make futile subdivisions of the parts of speech\n\u2014 introduction of a quadripartite scheme of the speech: (1)\nproem, (2) statement of the main claim, (3) proof of the stated claim\n(pistis), (4) epilogue.\nCh. 14\u201319: Particular parts of the speech: the proem in the\nthree genres of speech (Ch. 14) \u2014 topoi for slandering\n(Ch. 15) \u2014 narration (Ch. 16) \u2014 proof (pistis)\n(Ch. 17) \u2014 interrogation (Ch. 18) \u2014 epilogue/conclusion\n(Ch. 19).\n\n\n",
