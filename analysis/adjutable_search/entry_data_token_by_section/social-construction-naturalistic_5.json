    "main_text": "Naturalizing Social Construction\n3. Naturalizing Social Construction\n\nAs we noted above, the production of facts by social agents poses no\nspecial problem for the naturalist where that production is understood\ncausally, though naturalists of many stripes may want to produce\ncausal models to show how the macro-level social phenomena of interest\nto many social theorists and social scientists are causally realized\ngiven what we know about, e.g. human nature or the causal structure of\nthe universe. In contrast, constitutive claims of construction seem\ndifficult to make sense of (except on an account of construction on\nwhich social activity involving a representation comes to produce and\ncausally sustain an object that is referred to by that\nrepresentation).\n\nIn recognition of this state of affairs, many naturalist approaches to\nconstructed phenomena have involved attempts to causally model matters\nof interest to constructionists in ways that engage more or less\ncompletely with existing scientific knowledge. By way of illustrating\nsuch naturalistic approaches, I\u2019ll discuss the social\nconstruction of representations and of human nature in more\ndetail.\n",
