    "main_text": "Emergentism || The Reality of Emergence\n5.2 The Reality of Emergence\n\nIt is one thing to delineate the contours of the notion of emergence,\nanother to argue that emergent phenomena actually exist. A wide\nvariety of phenomena have been held to be emergent. Apart from\nconsciousness, various chemical and biological phenomena have been\nheld to be emergent. Broad is not willing to rule out a physicalistic\nreduction of chemistry and biology to physics: chemical and biological\nphenomena might, he believes, very well be reducible to complex\nmicrophysical processes. In his opinion, however, consciousness is a\ndifferent matter. We will turn to consciousness in a moment. When it\ncomes to biology and chemistry he declares that he does not see any\n\u201ca priori impossibility in a mechanistic biology or\nchemistry\u201d (1925, p. 72). He stresses that it is in practice\nenormously difficult to know whether, say, a certain biological\nfeature such as nutrition is emergent or not. It is evident from what\nBroad says that he recognises that the Emergentist stance has its\ndangers in that it tends to encourage acceptance of laws and\nproperties as ultimate and irreducible. There is a danger in this\nbecause, as he notes, reductive explanations have proved remarkably\nsuccessful in the past, and there is the possibility that what we take\nto be an emergent phenomenon is in fact reducible.\n",
