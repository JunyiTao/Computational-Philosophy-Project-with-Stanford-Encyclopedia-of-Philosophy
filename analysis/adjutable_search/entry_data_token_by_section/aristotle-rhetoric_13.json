    "main_text": "The Enthymeme || The Concept of Enthymeme\n6.1 The Concept of Enthymeme\n\nFor Aristotle, an enthymeme is what has the function of a proof or\ndemonstration in the domain of public speech. Since a demonstration is\na kind of sullogismos, the enthymeme is said to be a\nsullogismos too (on the enthymeme and its relation to\nsyllogistic theory see also Raphael 1974). The word\n\u2018enthymeme\u2019 (from\n\u2018enthumeisthai\u2014to consider\u2019) had already\nbeen coined by Aristotle\u2019s predecessors and originally\ndesignated clever sayings, bon mots, and short arguments involving a\nparadox or contradiction. The concepts \u2018proof\u2019\n(apodeixis) and \u2018sullogismos\u2019 play a\ncrucial role in Aristotle\u2019s logical-dialectical theory. In\napplying them to a term of conventional rhetoric, Aristotle appeals to\na well-known rhetorical technique, but, at the same time, codifies and\nredefines the original meaning of \u2018enthymeme\u2019: properly\nunderstood, what people call \u2018enthymeme\u2019 should\nhave the form of a sullogismos, i.e., a deductive\nargument.\n\nA major scholarly debate concerns the question of whether the\nenthymeme is actually meant to be a genuine sullogismos, i.e.\na deductive argument, or whether it is only a\n\u2018sullogismos of a kind\u2019, i.e. a\nsullogismos in an attenuated sense, which would amount to\nsaying that Aristotelian enthymemes, even though they are introduced\nas sullogismoi, are or include \u2018relaxed\ninferences\u2019, i.e. inferences that are not logically valid (see\nBurnyeat 1994, 1996). This suggestion has been widely accepted,\npresumably because it helps to solve the alleged paradox that,\nalthough Aristotle defines the enthymeme as a sullogismos,\nthe logical form of the enthymemes that are actually given as examples\nin the Rhetoric does not seem to conform to that of the\ncategorical syllogisms that we know from his Prior Analytics\n(a problem that, by the way, might also be addressed by assuming that\nthe enthymeme corresponds to the form of deductive arguments we find\nin the Topics, not to the ones familiar from the Prior\nAnalytics). Others accepted this suggestion primarily in order to\naccommodate the non-necessary sign arguments from Rhetoric\nI.2 (see\n \u00a7 6.5),\n which are treated as a type of enthymeme (without being flagged as\nmerely \u2018seeming enthymeme\u2019), but are said not to yield a\nsullogismos (see e.g. Allen 2001).\n\nSupplement on the Thesis that Enthymemes are Relaxed Inferences\n\n",
