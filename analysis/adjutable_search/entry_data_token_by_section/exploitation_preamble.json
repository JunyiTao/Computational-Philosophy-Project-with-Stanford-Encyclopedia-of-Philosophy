    "main_text": "\n\nTo exploit someone is to take unfair advantage of them. It is to use\nanother person\u2019s vulnerability for one\u2019s own benefit. Of\ncourse, benefitting from another\u2019s vulnerability is not always\nmorally wrong\u2014we do not condemn a chess player for exploiting a\nweakness in his opponent\u2019s defence, for instance. But some forms\nof advantage-taking do seem to be clearly wrong, and it is this\nnormative sense of exploitation that is of primary interest\nto moral and political philosophers.\n\nExploitation can be transactional or structural. In\nthe former case, the unfairness is a property of a discrete\ntransaction between two or more individuals. A sweatshop that pays low\nwages, for example, or a pharmaceutical research firm that tests drugs\non poor subjects in the developing world, might be said to exploit\nothers in this sense. But exploitation can also be\nstructural\u2014a property of institutions or systems in\nwhich the \u201crules of the game\u201d unfairly benefit one group\nof people to the detriment of another. As we will see below, Karl Marx\nbelieved that the economic and political institutions of capitalism\nwere exploitative in this sense. And some contemporary feminists have\nargued that the institution of traditional marriage is exploitative\ninsofar as it preys upon and reinforces pernicious forms of inequality\nbetween men and women (Sample 2003: Ch. 4).\n\nExploitation can also be harmful or mutually\nbeneficial. Harmful exploitation involves an interaction that\nleaves the victim worse off than she was, and than she was entitled to\nbe. The sort of exploitation involved in coercive sex trafficking, for\ninstance, is harmful in this sense. But as we will see below, not all\nexploitation is harmful. Exploitation can also be mutually beneficial,\nwhere both parties walk away better off than they were ex\nante. Most philosophers think that what makes such mutually\nbeneficial interactions nevertheless exploitative is that they are, in\nsome way, unfair.\n\nIt is relatively easy to come up with intuitively compelling cases of\nunfair, exploitative behavior. Providing a philosophical analysis to\nsupport and develop those intuitions, however, has proven more\ndifficult. The most obvious difficulty is specifying the conditions\nunder which a transaction or institution may be said to be unfair.\nDoes the unfairness involved in exploitation relate to the\ndistribution of resources? Or a violation of her moral rights? Is the\nunfairness involved in exploitation a matter of procedure, substance,\nor both? And how, if at all, are the attitudes and motives of the\nwould-be exploiter relevant to assessing charges of exploitation?\n",
