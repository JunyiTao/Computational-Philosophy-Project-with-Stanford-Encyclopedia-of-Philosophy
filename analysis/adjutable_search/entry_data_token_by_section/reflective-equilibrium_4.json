    "main_text": "Judgments || Initial Judgments\n1.4 Initial Judgments\n\nCutting across the issue of which constraints, if any, to put on\njudgments is the question of the priority of initial\njudgments over those arising during the reflective process.\n\nNarrow reflective equilibrium, described but not endorsed by Rawls and\nDaniels, matches principles to initial judgments, with only minor\nchanges allowed (Rawls 1971: 49; Rawls 1974: 8; Daniels 1996: 22, 49).\nA more moderate position is that \u201cinitially tenable commitments\nhave a presumption in their favor\u201d (Elgin 1996: 107). On this\nview, \u201cindependently motivated, initially tenable commitments\nmust underwrite coherence,\u201d for however coherent the components\nof reflective equilibrium may be, \u201ctheir mutual support may\nderive from a judicious disregard for contravening\nconsiderations\u201d (Elgin 1996: 107; see also Baumberger & Brun\n2021). Initial judgments anchor reflective equilibrium to something\noutside itself. A similar suggestion is that inchoate initial\njudgments are \u201ca central constraint\u201d (Schroeter 2004:\n122).\n\nAn opposing view gives initial judgments no priority over subsequent\njudgments. Moral beliefs may be formed that are not just different\nfrom but discontinuous with one\u2019s initial beliefs, which may be\nrejected. One may, for instance, undergo a moral conversion, becoming\nconvinced by the worldview of a Marx or Nietzsche (DePaul 1993: ch.\n1). This \u201cradical\u201d version of reflective equilibrium\nallows the moral deliberator to comprehensively change their mind.\n\nThough Michael DePaul states the radical position most clearly,\ncontrasting it with a \u201cconservative\u201d reflective\nequilibrium that he takes as dominant (DePaul 1993: 31), the radical\nview seems more in line with canonical reflective equilibrium, which\nencourages revision of judgment on theoretical grounds (see, e.g.,\nDaniels 1996: 2\u20134, 26\u201328, 60\u201361, 70\u201371). While\nRawls\u2019 applications of reflective equilibrium assume that we\nhave certain \u201cconvictions\u201d (such as those opposing racial\ndiscrimination or religious intolerance), in explaining the method he\nis clear that \u201ca person\u2019s sense of justice may or may not\nundergo a radical shift\u201d (Rawls 1971: 49)\u2014and on closer\ninspection we see that convictions are only\n\u201cprovisional fixed points\u201d (Rawls 1971: 20; Rawls\n2005: 8, emphasis added; see also Rawls 1974: 8). Even Elgin allows\nthat \u201cconsiderations with no initial tenability sometimes\ndislodge initially tenable commitments\u201d; it\u2019s just that\nthe latter \u201care not to be given up without reason\u201d (Elgin\n1996: 108, 107).\n\nThere is, then, significant agreement that initial judgments can be\noverridden by subsequent ones, with a residual disagreement as to\nwhether they nevertheless receive weak presumptive priority.\n",
