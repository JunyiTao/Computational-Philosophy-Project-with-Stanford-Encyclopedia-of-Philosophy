So, for example, the sentence \u201cThe present king of Canada was\nborn in Vienna\u201d has the existential presupposition that there\nis a present king of Canada.\n\n\nIt is not a simple task to understand the propositional treatment of\nsuch sentences, e.g. to give criteria for forming their negation, or\nunderstanding the truth conditions of implications.\n\n\nOne type of solution for these problems refers to the use of many\ntruth degrees, e.g. to product systems with ordered pairs as\ntruth degrees: meaning that their components evaluate in parallel\nwhether the presupposition is met, and whether the sentence is true or\nfalse. But 3-valued approaches have also been discussed.\n\n\nAnother type of ideas to use MVL tools in linguistics consists in\napproaches toward the modeling of natural language phenomena. Basic\nideas and some applications are offered e.g. in\nNov\u00e1k/Perfilieva/ Mo\u010dko\u0159 (1999) and Nov\u00e1k\n(2008).\n4.2 Applications to Logic\n\n\nA first type of application of systems of MVL to logic itself is to\nuse them to gain a better understanding of other systems of logic. In\nthis way the G\u00f6del systems arose out of an approach to test\nwhether intuitionistic logic may be understood as a finitely valued\nlogic. The introduction of systems of MVL by \u0141ukasiewicz (1920)\nwas initially guided by the (finally unsuccessful) idea of\nunderstanding the notion of possibility, i.e. modal logic, in a\n3-valued way.\n\n\nA second type of application to logic is the merging of different\ntypes of logical systems, e.g. the formulation of systems with graded\nmodalities. Melvin Fitting (1991/92) considers systems that define such\nmodalities by merging modal and many-valued logic, with intended\napplications to problems of Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\nA third type of application to logic is the modeling of partial\npredicates and truth value gaps. However, this is possible only in so\nfar as these truth value gaps behave \u201ctruth functionally\u201d, i.e. in so\nfar as the behavior of the truth value gaps in compound sentences can\nbe described by suitable truth functions. (This is not always the case,\ne.g. it is not the case in formulations which use\nsupervaluations.)\n",
