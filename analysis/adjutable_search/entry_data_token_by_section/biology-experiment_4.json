    "main_text": "Crucial Experimental Evidence || DNA Replication and Inference to the Best Explanation\n2.2 DNA Replication and Inference to the Best Explanation\n\nAs another example, consider the models for DNA replication that were\nproposed in the 1950s after the publication of the double helix\nstructure of DNA by J.D. Watson and F.R.H. Crick (Lehninger 1975):\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nIn purely causal terms, what all these models show is that the\nsequence of nucleotides in a newly synthesized DNA molecule depends on\nthe sequence of a pre-existing molecule. But the models also contain\nstructural information such as information the DNA double\nhelix topology and the movements undergone by a replicating DNA\nmolecule (still hypothetical at that time). According to the model on\nthe left, the so-called \u201cconservative\u201d model, the two\nstrands of the DNA double helix do not separate prior to replication;\nthey stick together and the daughter molecule grows along an intact\ndouble helix that acts as a template as a whole. According to the\nmodel in the middle, called the \u201csemi-conservative\u201d\nmechanism (believed to be correct today), the two strands do separate\nin the process. The newly synthesized strands grow along the separated\npre-existing strands that each acts as templates. On the model on the\nright, the \u201cdispersive\u201d model, the two strands not only\nseparate in the process, they are also cut into pieces that are then\nrejoined. While pure causal graphs (i.e., causal graphs that contain\nonly information about what variables depend on what other variables\ncausally) may be used to depict the causes of the separation and\ncutting events in semi-conservative and dispersive model, it also\ntakes a description of the structure of the DNA molecule, including\nthe topology and relative movements of the strands at different stages\nof the replication process. This is genuine mechanistic information\nthat must supplement the information contained in the causal graphs in\norder to provide a normatively adequate mechanistic explanation.\n\nHow can such a mechanism be tested? To see this, it is illuminating to\nconsider the famous experiment that is said to have enabled a choice\nbetween the three DNA replication mechanisms in 1957. Also known as\n\u201cthe most beautiful experiment in biology\u201d (Holmes 2011),\nthis experiment was carried out by Matthew Meselson and Frank Stahl by\nusing an analytic ultracentrifuge (see also the discussion of\nthe Meselson-Stahl experiment in the entry\n experiment in physics).\n\nMeselson and Stahl grew bacteria in a growth medium that contained a\nheavy nitrogen isotope, 15N. These bacteria were then\ntransferred to a medium with normal light nitrogen, 14N.\nAfter one generation, the bacteria were harvested and their DNA was\nextracted and loaded onto a caesium chloride solution in the\nultracentrifuge chamber (Fig. 2). Caesium atoms are so heavy that they\nwill form a concentration gradient when subjected to high centrifugal\nforces. In such a gradient, DNA floats at a band in the gradient where\nthe molecular density corresponds to that of the caesium chloride\nsolution. Thus, the analytic centrifuge is an extremely sensitive\nmeasuring device for molecular density. In fact, it is sensitive\nenough to detect the difference between DNA that contains heavy\nnitrogen and DNA that contains light nitrogen. It can also distinguish\nthese two DNA species from a hybrid made of one strand containing\nheavy nitrogen and one strand containing light nitrogen. Indeed, after\none round of replication, the bacterial DNA in Meselson\u2019s and Stahl\u2019s\nexperiment was of intermediate density. After another round, the DNA\nhad the same density as DNA in its natural state.\n\n\nFigure 2.\nThe Meselson-Stahl experiment. The depiction of the centrifuge is\nmisleading; Meselson and Stahl were using a sophisticated analytic\nultracentrifuge, not a swinging bucket preparatory centrifuge as this\npicture suggests. Furthermore, this representation of the experiment\nalready contains its theoretical interpretation (Watson\n1965).[1]\n\n\nThe outcome was exactly what one would expect on the basis of the\nsemi-conservative model: After one round of replication, the DNA is\nexactly of intermediate density because it is a hybrid of a heavy and\na light strand (containing heavy or light nitrogen, respectively).\nAfter another round, a light molecule appears which contains no heavy\nnitrogen. With the exception of the heavy/light hybrid, there are no\nother molecules of intermediate density (as one would expect on the\ndispersive scheme).\n\nEven though this really looked like a spectacular confirmation of the\nsemi-conservative scheme, Meselson and Stahl (1958) were quite\ncautious in stating their conclusions. Avoiding theoretical\ninterpretation, all the experiment showed was that base nitrogen\ndistributes evenly during replication. While this is inconsistent with\nthe dispersive mechanism, it did not rule out the conservative\nmechanism. For it was possible that the material of intermediate\ndensity that the ultracentrifuge\u2019s optical devices picked up did not\nconsist of hybrid heavy/light DNA molecules at all, but of some kind\nof complex of heavy and light DNA. For example, Meselson and Stahl\nspeculated that end-to-end covalent associations of old and newly\nsynthesized DNA that was produced by the conservative mechanism would\nalso have intermediate density and therefore produce the same band in\ntheir experiment. For this reason, could not completely rule out an\ninterpretation of the results in terms of the conservative\nmechanism.\n\nMeselson\u2019s and Stahl\u2019s caution was well justified, as we know now. For\nthey did not know exactly what molecular species made up the bands\nthey saw in their CsCl gradients. More recent considerations suggest\nthat their DNA must have been fragmented, due to Meselson\u2019s and\nStahl\u2019s use of a hypodermic needle to upload the DNA on their\ngradients. Such a treatment tears a whole genome from E. coli\ninto little pieces. This fragmentation of the DNA would have ruled out\nthe alternative interpretation with end-to-end linked molecules, had\nthe scientists been aware of it at the time. In fact, without the\nshearing of the DNA before the density measurement the whole\nexperiment wouldn\u2019t have worked in the first place, due to the\ncircular structure of the E. coli chromosome, which affects\nits density (Hanawalt 2004). What this shows is that there were\nrelevant facts about the experimental system that Meselson and Stahl\ndid not know, which makes it difficult to view this experiment as\ncrucial.\n\nNonetheless, it is possible to view the experiment as performed in\n1957 as strong evidence for the semi-conservative mechanism. Weber\n(2009) argues that this mechanism is part of the best\nexplanation of Meselson\u2019s and Stahl\u2019s data. By\n\u201cdata\u201d, Weber means the actual bands observed. Why is this\nexplanation better than the one involving the conservative scheme and\nend-to-end associations of heavy and light DNA? To be\nconsistent with some data is not the same as being a good\nexplanation of the data. The explanation using the\nsemi-conservative scheme was better because it showed directly how the\nnitrogen is distributed evenly. By contrast, the alternative\nexplanation requires the additional assumption that the parental and\nfilial DNA somehow remain covalently attached together after\nreplication. This assumption wasn\u2019t part of the mechanism, therefore\nthe latter explanation was incomplete. A complete explanation is\nalways better than an incomplete one; no principle of parsimony need\nbe invoked here.\n\nThe case can thus be reconstructed as an inference to the best\nexplanation (Lipton 2004), or perhaps preferably as an inference to\nthe only explanation (Bird 2007). Inference to the best explanation\n(IBE), also known as abduction, is a controversial inductive inference\nscheme that selects from a set of candidate hypothesis the one that\nbest explains the phenomena.\n\nA variant of IBE is also used by Cresto (2008) to reconstruct the\nexperiment by Avery that showed that the transforming principle in\npneumococcus is DNA rather than protein. However, her conclusion is\nthat, in this case, IBE is inconclusive. What it does show is that\nthere was a rational disagreement, at the time, on the question of\nwhether DNA was the transforming principle. Novick and Scholl\n(forthcoming) argue that Avery et al. were not relying on IBE; they\nactually had a stronger case conforming to the traditional vera causa\nideal (see Section 5.2).\n\nTo sum up, we have seen that a methodological analysis of some of\nbiology\u2019s most famous experiments reveals many intricacies and\nlacunae in their evidential force, which makes it difficult to see\nthem as \u201ccrucial experiments\u201d. However, a rationale other\nthan their pedagogical value can often be given for why the textbooks\naccord them a special epistemic status.\n",
