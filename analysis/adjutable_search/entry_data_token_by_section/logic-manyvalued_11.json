So, for example, the sentence \u201cThe present king of Canada was\nborn in Vienna\u201d has the existential presupposition that there\nis a present king of Canada.\n\n\nIt is not a simple task to understand the propositional treatment of\nsuch sentences, e.g. to give criteria for forming their negation, or\nunderstanding the truth conditions of implications.\n\n\nOne type of solution for these problems refers to the use of many\ntruth degrees, e.g. to product systems with ordered pairs as\ntruth degrees: meaning that their components evaluate in parallel\nwhether the presupposition is met, and whether the sentence is true or\nfalse. But 3-valued approaches have also been discussed.\n\n\nAnother type of ideas to use MVL tools in linguistics consists in\napproaches toward the modeling of natural language phenomena. Basic\nideas and some applications are offered e.g. in\nNov\u00e1k/Perfilieva/ Mo\u010dko\u0159 (1999) and Nov\u00e1k\n(2008).\n4.2 Applications to Logic\n\n\nA first type of application of systems of MVL to logic itself is to\nuse them to gain a better understanding of other systems of logic. In\nthis way the G\u00f6del systems arose out of an approach to test\nwhether intuitionistic logic may be understood as a finitely valued\nlogic. The introduction of systems of MVL by \u0141ukasiewicz (1920)\nwas initially guided by the (finally unsuccessful) idea of\nunderstanding the notion of possibility, i.e. modal logic, in a\n3-valued way.\n\n\nA second type of application to logic is the merging of different\ntypes of logical systems, e.g. the formulation of systems with graded\nmodalities. Melvin Fitting (1991/92) considers systems that define such\nmodalities by merging modal and many-valued logic, with intended\napplications to problems of Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\nA third type of application to logic is the modeling of partial\npredicates and truth value gaps. However, this is possible only in so\nfar as these truth value gaps behave \u201ctruth functionally\u201d, i.e. in so\nfar as the behavior of the truth value gaps in compound sentences can\nbe described by suitable truth functions. (This is not always the case,\ne.g. it is not the case in formulations which use\nsupervaluations.)\n4.3  Applications to Philosophical Problems\n\n\nHow to understand the meaning of \u201ctruth\u201d is an old philosophical\nproblem. A logical approach toward this problem consists in enriching a\nformalized language \\(L\\) with a truth predicate \\(T\\), to be\napplied to sentences of \\(L\\) \u2013 or, even better, to be\napplied to sentences of the extension \\(L_{T}\\)\nof \\(L\\) with the predicate \\(T\\).\n\n\nBased upon this idea, a reasonable theory of such languages which\ncontain truth predicates was developed in the mid-1930s by A. Tarski.\nOne of the results was that such a language\n\\(L_{T}\\), which contains its own truth predicate\n\\(T\\) and has a certain richness in expressive power, is\nnecessarily inconsistent.\n\n\nAnother approach toward such languages \\(L_{T}\\) which contain their\nown truth predicate \\(T\\) was offered by S. Kripke (1975) and is\nessentially based upon the idea of considering \\(T\\) as a partial\npredicate, i.e. as a predicate which has \u201ctruth value\ngaps\u201d. In a case Kripke (1975) considers, these truth value gaps\nbehave \u201ctruth functionally\u201d and so can be treated like a\nthird truth degree. Their propagation in compound sentences then\nbecomes describable by suitable truth degree functions of three-valued\nsystems. In Kripke\u2019s (1975) approach this reference was to\nthree-valued systems which S. C. Kleene (1938) had considered in the\n(mathematical) context of partial functions and predicates in\nrecursion theory.\n\n\nA second application of MVL inside philosophy is to the old paradoxes\nlike the Sorites (heap) or the falakros (bald\nman). (See the entry\n Sorites paradox.)\n In the case of the Sorites, the paradox is as\nfollows:\n(i) One grain of sand is not a heap of sand. And (ii)\nadding one grain of sand to something which is not a heap does not turn\nit into a heap. Hence (iii) a single grain of sand can never turn into\na heap of sand, no matter how many grains of sand are added to\nit.\n\n\nThus the true premise (i) gives a false conclusion (iii) via a\nsequence of inferences using (ii). A rather natural solution inside an\nextension of MVL with a graded notion of inference, often called\nfuzzy logic, is to take the notion of heap as a vague\none, i.e. as a notion which may hold true of given objects only to some\n(truth) degree. Additionally it is suitable to consider premise (ii) as\nonly partially true, however to a degree which is quite near to the\nmaximal degree 1. Then each single inference step is of the form:\n\n\n(a)\\(k\\) grains of sand do not make a heap.\n(ii)Adding one grain of sand to \\(k\\) grains does\n      not make \\((k+1)\\) grains into a heap.\nHence\n(b)\\((k+1)\\) grains of sand do not make a heap.\n\n\nHowever, this inference has to involve truth degrees for the\npremises (a) and (ii), and has to provide a truth degree for the\nconclusion (b). The crucial idea for the modeling of this type of\nreasoning inside MVL is to make sure that the truth degree for (b) is\nsmaller than the truth degree for (a) in case the truth degree for (ii)\nis smaller than the maximal one. In effect, then, the sentence \\(n\\)\ngrains of sand do not make a heap tends toward being false for an\nincreasing number \\(n\\) of grains.\n4.4 Applications to Hardware Design\n\n\nClassical propositional logic is used as a technical tool for the\nanalysis and synthesis of some types of electrical circuits built up\nfrom \u201cswitches\u201d with two stable states, i.e. voltage\nlevels. A rather straightforward generalization allows the use of\nan \\(m\\)-valued logic to discuss circuits built from similar\n\u201cswitches\u201d with \\(m\\) stable states. This whole field\nof application of many-valued logic is called many-valued (or even:\nfuzzy) switching. A good introduction is Epstein (1993).\n",
