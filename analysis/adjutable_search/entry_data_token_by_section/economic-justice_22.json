    "main_text": "Related topics || Marxism\n7.3 Marxism\n\nRoemer (1982, 1986c) proposes a renewed economic analysis of Marxian\nconcepts, in particular exploitation. He shows that, even if the\ntheory of labor value is flawed as a causal theory of prices, it may\nbe consistently used in order to measure exploitation and analyze the\ncorrelation between exploitation and the class status of individuals.\nHowever, he considers that this concept of exploitation is ethically\nnot very appealing, since it roughly amounts to requiring individual\nconsumption to be proportional to labor, and he suggests a different\ndefinition of exploitation, in terms of undue advantage due to unequal\ndistribution of some assets. This leads him eventually to merge this\nline of analysis with the general stream of egalitarian theories of\njustice. The idea that consumption should be proportional to labor has\nalso received some attention in the theory of fair allocation (Moulin\n1990, Roemer & Silvestre 1993). See Roemer (1986a) for a\ncollection of philosophical and economic essays on Marxism. There has\nbeen a recent wave of analysis of the concept of exploitation in\neconomics, in particular under the impulsion of Veneziani and\nYoshihara (2015, forthcoming). See also Veneziani (2013), Fleurbaey\n(2014) and Skillman (2014). For the references in philosophy, see the\nentry on\n exploitation.\n",
