    "main_text": "Fairness || Fair Division\n2.1 Fair Division\n\nSocial procedures are as old as the world. Divide and\nchoose (also known as \u201cI cut, you choose\u201d) is\na procedure for two-person fair division of some desirable or\nundesirable heterogeneous good. One person divides the good into what\nshe believes to be equal shares, and the other person chooses. If the\ntwo participants have different value judgements on parts of the\ngoods, it is possible that both participants feel that they received\nmore than 50 percent of the goods. Indeed, let \\(X\\) be a set\nrepresenting the good to be divided. A valuation function \\(V\\) for\n\\(X\\) is a function from \\({{\\cal P}}(X)\\) to \\([0,1]\\) with the\nproperties that \\(V(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(V(X) = 1\\), and for all\nsubsets \\(A\\), \\(B\\), it holds that \\(A \\subseteq B \\subseteq X\\)\nimplies \\(V(A) \\leq V(B)\\) (for explanation of notation, see\nsupplement on\n basic set theory).\n Suppose \\(V_m\\) and \\(V_y\\) are functions for my and your valuation\nof the contents of \\(X\\). If \\(V_m\\) and \\(V_y\\) are different, this\nmeans that you and I value some items in \\(X\\) differently. It\nfollows, as was already observed by Steinhaus in 1948, that there\nexists a division that gives both parties more than their due part;\n\u201cthis fact disproves the common opinion that differences in\nestimation make fair division difficult\u201d (Steinhaus\n1948).\n\nIt matters whether the valuations are known to the other party. Such\nknowledge can be used to advantage by the one who cuts. First consider\nthe case that your valuation is unknown to me, and vice versa. Then if\nI cut, the best I can do is pick sets \\(A, B \\subseteq X\\) with \\(A\n\\cap B = \\emptyset\\), \\(A \\cup B = X\\), and \\(V_m(A) = V_m(B)\\). If\nyou choose, you will use \\(V_y\\) to pick the maximum of \\(\\{ V_y(A),\nV_y(B) \\}\\). It follows immediately that cutting guarantees a fair\nshare, but no more than that, while choosing holds a promise for a\nbetter deal. So if you ever get the choice between cutting and\nchoosing in a situation where both parties only know their own\nvaluation, then it is to your advantage to leave the cutting to the\nother person.\n\nHowever, if the valuations are common knowledge (see entry on\n common knowledge),\n the situation is reversed, for then it is more advantageous to take\nthe role of cutter. As cutter, you can attempt to make a division intp\nsets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) with \\(A\\) slightly more valuable than \\(B\\)\naccording to the valuation of the other party, while \\(B\\) is much\nmore valuable than \\(A\\) according to your own valuation.\n\nThe example shows that issues of knowledge and ignorance, are crucial\nfor analysis of fair division protocols. Epistemic logic (see entry on\n epistemic logic)\n can shed much light on many subtle aspects of knowledge and ignorance\nin social interactions, and in particular in fair division problems;\nfor an interesting cake-cutting experiment showing the importance of\nknowledge and ignorance, see Kyropoulou et al.\n2019. Still, in traditional studies of fair division the role\nof knowledge is not taken into account, as is witnessed by the\ncomprehensive study of \u201ccake cutting algorithms\u201d in Robertson\n& Webb (1998).\n",
