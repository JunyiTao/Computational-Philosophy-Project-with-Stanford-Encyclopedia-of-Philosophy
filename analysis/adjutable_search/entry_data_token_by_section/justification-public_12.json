    "main_text": "Sister Concepts || Publicity\n5.1 Publicity\n\nFor Rawls, \u201cpublic justification\u201d occurs when a\nwell-ordered society achieves \u201cfull publicity.\u201d Full\npublicity contains three levels (see the entry on\n publicity).\n The first level occurs when public principles of justice effectively\nregulate society. Rawls (2005, 66): \u201ccitizens accept and know\nthat others likewise accept those principles, and this in turn is\npublicly recognized.\u201d Each person sees society\u2019s basic\nstructure as justified by shared reasoning.\n\nThe second level requires that citizens of a well-ordered society have\nshared beliefs. In particular, they believe that all can accept the\nfirst principles of justice. Their evaluations draw on \u201cgeneral\nbeliefs about human nature\u201d and how institutions work (67).\n\nLevel three establishes \u201cthe full justification of the public\nconception of justice as it would be presented in its own\nterms.\u201d It must include all considerations relevant to\ngenerating a conception of justice. Then the full justification\nbecomes \u201cpublicly known\u201d or at least \u201cpublicly\navailable.\u201d\n\nFull publicity arises when all three levels of publicity occur. When a\nsociety reaches full publicity, its conception of justice becomes\npublicly justified. Yet this is so only given two conditions. The\nconception of justice must become a political conception. It must\nderive from shared and public political values. Second, it must reach\nan overlapping consensus. Full publicity comprises \u201cpublic\njustification,\u201d Rawls\u2019s third stage of justifying a\npolitical conception. It occurs when each person knows that the\npolitical conception is fully justified. (Rawls 2005, 386\u20137).\nFor Rawls, \u201cpublic justification happens when all the reasonable\nmembers of political society carry out a justification of the shared\npolitical conception by embedding it in their several reasonable\ncomprehensive views.\u201d Thus, public justification obtains via\npublicity.\n\nCharles Larmore (2008, 203\u20137) traces Rawls\u2019s idea of\npublic reason to concerns about publicity. Paul Weithman (2011, 242)\nstresses the centrality of publicity in Rawls. Publicity helps educate\nsociety about the basis of its political views. And it is crucial for\nmaintaining a community as stable for the right reasons.\n\nRawls\u2019s notion of publicity is the most common in the\nliterature, but Gaus (2011, 296\u20137) offers a less demanding\n\u201cweak\u201d publicity standard. Notice, then, that\nRawls\u2019s conception of publicity is quite demanding. The PJP does\nnot insist that public justifications achieve full publicity, and most\ntheorists say that people should be able to tell when laws or rules\nare publicly justified. Publicity is a \u201csister concept\u201d to\npublic justification when it helps to establish public\njustification.\n\nSome theorists define publicity as the publicity of shared reasons.\n(See Rawls 2002, 173.) They adopt a consensus approach to aid public\nrecognition that public justification occurs. (See Hadfield and Macedo\n2012; Watson and Hartley 2018.) And yet, consensus and convergence\nviews appeal to publicity. Both approaches want citizens to know when\nlaws or policies are justified for all. Convergence theorists may not\ndefine the PJP as including shared values, but they still find\npublicity attractive. This difference draws on the contrast between\nintelligibility and accessibility discussed above.\n\nPublicity remains a central topic in this literature, but has gone\nwithout major treatments until Kogelmann 2022.\n",
