    "main_text": "Calibration and Higher-Order Objective Probability || Guess Calibration\n4.1 Guess Calibration\n\nOne way of formulating a constraint that says we should be no more\nconfident than we are reliable is by requiring guess\ncalibration (GC):\n\n\nIf I draw the conclusion that q on the basis of evidence\ne, my credence in q should equal my prior expected\nreliability with respect to q. (White 2009; Sliwa &\nHorowitz 2015)\n\n\nYour expected reliability with respect to q is understood as\nthe probability\u2014chance or propensity\u2014that your guess of\nq is true. You may not be sure what your reliability is so you\nwill use an expected value, a weighted average of the values you think\nare possible, and this should be a prior probability, evaluated\nindependently of your current belief that p.\n\nSelf-doubt on this picture would be a state in which you\u2019ve\ndrawn conclusion q, say because your confidence in q\nexceeded a given threshold, but also have reason to believe your\nreliability with respect to q is not as high as that\nconfidence, and such a state would be a violation of GC. Whether this\nself-doubting state can be coherent when a subject knows her own\nbeliefs depends very much on how the reliability aspect is formulated.\nIf chances and propensities that your guesses are true are determined\nby frequencies of ordered pairs of guesses of q and truth or\nfalsity of q then self-doubt will make one incoherent here in\nthe way that representing oneself as an anti-expert did above, because\ncoherence and expected reliability will be logically\n equivalent.[2]\n In any case, GC requires matching between the orders in all cases, and\ntells us that the match is between your confidence and your\nreliability.\n\nGC makes sense of the intuition in some cases of self-doubt that the\nsubject should drop her confidence. The pilot on looking at the\naltimeter reading should cease to be so sure she has enough gas for\nfifty more miles because it gives her reason to think she is in a\nstate where her calculations will not reliably turn out truths.\nSimilarly, the doctor realizing she is severely underslept acquires\nreason to think she is in a state where her way of coming to beliefs\ndoes not reliably lead to true conclusions. The main dissatisfaction\nwith GC has been that it apparently cedes all authority to\nsecond-order evidence. In fact in GC\u2019s formulation the\nconfidence you should finally have in q does not depend on how\nfar the evidence e supports q or how far you think\ne supports q, but only on what you think is your\npropensity for or frequency of getting it right about q,\nwhether you used evidence or not.\n\nThere may be cases where second-order evidence is worrying enough that\none\u2019s first order conclusion should be mistrusted entirely, even\nif it was in fact soundly made\u2014maybe the pilot and doctor are\nsuch cases since the stakes are high. But as we saw above it\ndoesn\u2019t seem right across the board to take first-order evidence\nto count for nothing when second-order evidence is around. Here we can\nsee that by supposing that two people, Anton and Ana, reason to\ndifferent conclusions, q and not-q, on the basis of the\nsame evidence, Anton evaluating the evidence correctly, Ana not.\nSuppose both are given the same undermining evidence, say that people\nin their conditions only get it right 60% of the time. According to\nGC, rationality requires both of them to become 60% confident in their\nconclusions. Anton, who reasoned correctly from the evidence, is no\nmore rational than Ana, and has no right to a higher confidence in his\nconclusion q than Ana who reasoned badly has for her conclusion\nnot-q (Sliwa & Horowitz 2015).\n",
