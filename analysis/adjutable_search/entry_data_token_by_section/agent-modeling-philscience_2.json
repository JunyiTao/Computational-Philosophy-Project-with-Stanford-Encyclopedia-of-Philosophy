The importance of a synchronous pursuit of a plurality of\ntheories in a given domain has long been recognized in the\nphilosophical literature (Mill 1859; Kuhn 1977; Feyerabend 1975;\nKitcher 1993; Longino 2002; Chang 2012). But how does a scientific\ncommunity achieve an optimal distribution of research efforts? Which\nfactors influence scientists to divide and coordinate their labor in a\nway that stimulates theoretical diversity? In short, how is\ntheoretical diversity achieved and maintained?\n\nOne way to address this question is by examining how different\nincentives of scientists impact their division of labor. To see the\nrelevance of this question, consider a community of scientists all of\nwhom are driven by the same epistemic incentives. As Kitcher (1990)\nargued, in such a community everyone might end up pursuing the same,\ninitially most promising line of inquiry, resulting in little to no\ndiversity. Traditionally, philosophers of science tried to address\nthis worry by arguing that a diversity in theory choice may result\nfrom diverse methodological approaches (Feyerabend 1975), diverse\napplications of epistemic values (Kuhn 1977), or from different\ncognitive attitudes towards theories, such as acceptance and\npursuit-worthiness (Laudan 1977). Kitcher, however, wondered whether\nnon-epistemic incentives, such as fame and fortune\u2014usually\nthought of as interfering with the epistemic goals of\nscience\u2014might actually be beneficial for the community by\nencouraging scientists to deviate from dominant lines of inquiry.\n\nThe idea that scientists are rewarded for their achievements through\ncredit, which impacts their research choices, had previously been\nrecognized by Merton (1973) and Hull (1978, 1988). For example, a\nscientist may receive recognition for being the first to make a\ndiscovery (known as the \u201cpriority rule\u201d), which may\nincentivize a specific approach to research. Yet, such non-epistemic\nincentives could also fail to promote an optimal kind of diversity.\nFor instance, they may result in too much research being spent on\nfutile hypotheses and/or in too few scientists investigating the best\ntheories. Moreover, an incentive structure will have undesirable\neffects if rewards are misallocated to scientists that are\nwell-networked rather than assigned to those who are actually first to\nmake discoveries, or if credit-driven science lowers the quality of\nscientific output. This raises the question: which incentive\nstructures promote an optimal division of labor, without having\nepistemically or morally harmful effects?\n\nABMs provide an apt ground for studying these issues: by modeling\nindividual scientists as driven by specific incentives, we can examine\ntheir division of labor and the resulting communal inquiry. We will\nlook at the models studying these issues in\n Section 4.1.\n",
