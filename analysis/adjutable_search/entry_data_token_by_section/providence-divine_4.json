    "main_text": "An Epistemic Alternative\n5. An Epistemic Alternative\n\nIt is commonly supposed that Molinism represents the only middle\nground between, on the one hand, a risk-taking God of the sort\nenvisioned by both open theism and simple foreknowledge views (like\nthe Boethian view described above) according to which whatever\nforeknowledge God does have is not of much (or any) providential use,\nand, on the other hand, full-blown theological determinism. It has\nbeen suggested recently (in Kvanvig 2011, chapter 8), however, that\nthere may be space for views other than Molinism in the area between\nthose two extremes. Molinist \u201cmiddle knowledge\u201d is\nknowledge of subjunctive conditionals (\u201cwere Jeff to be put in\ncircumstances C, he would do X\u201d), which God then employs to\nguide his decisions as to what circumstances to actualize. But there\nare a number of other sorts of conditionals that might be of use to\nGod in his decision-making. One is a particular type of indicative\nconditional, an epistemic conditional: \u201cif Booth didn\u2019t\nkill Lincoln, someone else did.\u201d This is a different sort of\nconditional than the subjunctive, for it is true while the\ncorresponding subjunctive (\u201cif Booth hadn\u2019t killed\nLincoln, someone else would have\u201d) is false. An epistemic\nconditional is true when knowing the antecedent puts one in a position\nto know the consequent, such that one\u2019s belief in the consequent\n(on the basis of the antecedent) will count as knowledge so long as\nthe consequent is true and the evidence is undefeated (by contrary\nevidence one has or by external pieces of information that result in a\nGettier situation).\n\nIf Molinist subjunctive conditionals are replaced by these epistemic\nconditionals, a different, \u201cepistemic\u201d theory of creation\nand providence may be generated. God reasons suppositionally: suppose\nI do X, what am I in a position to know would result? He uses his\nknowledge of the epistemic conditionals to infer what he can, and then\nsupposes further actions on his part, inferring further information.\nImportantly, some of these conditionals will describe human free\ndecisions, for even on libertarian views of the will it is still\npossible sometimes to know what someone will freely do on the basis of\nother information about them. Sometimes God will come to a point where\nhe cannot infer anything further because there just isn\u2019t enough\ninformation, but sometimes he will be able to generate a complete\nhistory of the world in this manner, a complete plan or story of the\nworld. Such complete plans or stories are the possible worlds that he\nwill be able to ensure actually come about (by actualizing all the\nstates of affairs he had supposed throughout the reasoning process);\nthey are the feasible worlds on this account of providence. So, like\nMolinism, there are possible worlds that God cannot bring about, but\n(also like Molinism) he has quite a bit more control over the ones he\ncan bring about than is allowed by open theism. The limitations on God\nare subtly different on this view than on Molinism. On Molinism the\nlimitations are the simple facts about what free beings would do in\nany given situation, while on the epistemic account the limitations\nare the availability of evidence with respect to what free beings will\ndo in any given situation.\n\nPerhaps the greatest strength of the epistemic account is that it may\navoid the central problem of Molinism: the question of how the\nconditionals in question can be grounded, and grounded in such a way\nthat God can know them independently of his decision to create. If\nepistemic principles are necessary truths, then God can know a host of\nepistemic conditionals simply on the basis of his knowledge of\nnecessary truths. One problem with the epistemic account is simply the\nquestion of whether there really are sufficient true epistemic\nconditionals for God to come to know enough about what free beings\nwill do with their freedom to generate a whole history of the world.\nPerhaps the profoundest problem for this view, however, is the\nquestion of the infallibility of divine foreknowledge. It is a key\nfeature of the view that the reasoning from antecedent to consequent\nlicensed by the epistemic conditionals is the sort involved in\nordinary judgments of knowledge, and so is defeasible (subject to\noverturning by further information) and fallible. But surely\nGod\u2019s knowledge cannot be defeasible and fallible.\nKvanvig\u2019s solution to this problem is to argue that once the\ndivine course of suppositional reasoning reaches completion and\ndescribes a full possible world, it transforms from fallible and\ndefeasible to infallible and indefeasible precisely because of its\ncompleteness; there are no further pieces of information that God\ncould learn which would undermine the reasoning (an internal defeater)\nor put God into a Gettier situation (an external defeater). But it is\nhard to intuitively reconcile Kvanvig\u2019s solution here with the\nreality that all of this reasoning is merely suppositional and each\nstep on its own is fallible; couldn\u2019t it turn out to be mistaken\nat some point once the suppositions are made reality and the divine\nfallible reasoning collides with what actually happens? (See Kvanvig\n2011 and Hasker 2016 for discussion of these objections.)\n",
