    "main_text": "Quantum Individuality\n3. Quantum Individuality\n\n\nThis conclusion \u2013 that quantal objects are not individuals\n\u2013 is not the whole story, however. First of all, the contrast\nbetween classical and quantum physics with regard to individuality and\nnon-individuality is not as straightforward as it might seem. As\nalready indicated, the above account involving permutations of\nparticles in boxes appears to fit nicely with an understanding of\nindividuality in terms of Lockean substance or primitive thisness.\nHowever, one can give an alternative field-theoretic account in which\nparticles are represented as dichotomic \u2018Yes/No\u2019 fields:\nwith such a field, the field amplitude is simply \u2018Yes\u2019 at\nlocation x if the \u2018particle\u2019 is present at x\nand \u2018No\u2019 if it is not (Redhead 1983). On this account,\nindividuality is conferred via spatio-temporal location together with\nthe assumption of impenetrability mentioned in the Introduction. Thus\nthe above account of particle individuality in terms of either Lockean\nsubstance or primitive thisness is not necessary for classical\nstatistical mechanics. \n\n\nThe particles-and-boxes picture above corresponds to the physicists\u2019\nmultidimensional \u2018phase space\u2019, which describes which\nindividuals have which properties, whereas the field- theoretic\nrepresentation corresponds to \u2018distribution space\u2019, which\nsimply describes which properties are instantiated in what numbers.\nHuggett has pointed out that the former supports haecceitism, whereas\nthe latter does not and, furthermore, that the empirical evidence\nprovides no basis for choosing between these two spaces (Huggett 1999a).\nThus the claim that classical statistical mechanics is wedded to\nhaecceitism also becomes suspect.\n\n\nSecondly, the above argument from permutations can be considered from\na radically different perspective. In the classical case the\nsituations with one particle in each box are given a weight of\n\u20182\u2019 in the counting of possible arrangements. In the case\nof quantum statistics this situation is given a weight of\n\u20181\u2019. With this weighting, there are two possible\nstatistics, as we noted: Bose-Einstein, corresponding to a symmetric\nstate function for the assembly of particles and Fermi-Dirac,\ncorresponding to an anti-symmetric state function. Given the\nIndistinguishability Postulate, it can be shown that symmetric state\nfunctions will always remain symmetric and anti-symmetric always\nanti-symmetric. Thus, if the initial condition is imposed that the\nstate of the system is either symmetric or anti-symmetric, then only\none of the two possibilities \u2013 Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac\n\u2013 is ever available to the system, and this explains why the\nweighting assigned to \u2018one particle in each state\u2019 is half\nthe classical value. This gives us an alternative way of understanding\nthe difference between classical and quantum statistics, not in terms\nof the lack of individuality of the objects, but rather in terms of\nwhich states are accessible to them (French 1989). In other words, the\nimplication of the different \u2018counting\u2019 in quantum\nstatistics can be understood as not that the objects are\nnon-individuals in some sense, but that there are different sets of\nstates available to them, compared to the classical case. On this\nview, the objects can still be regarded as individuals, with the issue remaining as to how that individuality is to be cashed out.\n\n\nBoth of these perspectives raise interesting and distinct metaphysical issues (for\na useful introduction see Castellani 1998b).  Let us consider, first,\nthe objects-as-individuals \u2018package\u2019. How is the relevant\nnotion of individuality to be articulated? One option would be to take\none of the traditional lines and ground it some form of primitive thisness or\nLockean substance. However, this kind of metaphysics is anathema to\nmany of a naturalistic persuasion, not least because it lies beyond\nthe physical pale, as it were. Alternatively, one might take\nindividuality to be primitive but then assuage any naturalistic\ntendencies by tying it to the idea of \u2018countability\u2019\n\u2013 in the sense that we can always count how many quantum objects\nare in a given state \u2013 and take the latter to be both physically\nsignificant and capable of being \u2018read off\u2019 from the\ntheory (Dorato and Morganti 2013). Nevertheless, it may be felt that\nnaturalism is better satisfied by eschewing such primitivist moves and\ntaking the individuality of the objects to be reducible to their\ndiscernibility and ground the latter in their properties, as presented\nby the theory (a feeling that may be further supported by doubts as to\nthe physical plausibility of possible worlds containing only one\nobject, as mentioned above). Of course, for this to work, we need some\nassurance that no two objects are indiscernible (or indistinguishable)\nin the relevant sense. Traditionally this assurance has been provided\nby Leibniz\u2019s famous Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles, so\nlet us consider the status of this Principle in the context of modern\nphysics.\n",
