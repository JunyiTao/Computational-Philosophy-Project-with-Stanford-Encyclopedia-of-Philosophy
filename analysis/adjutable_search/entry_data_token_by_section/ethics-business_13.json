The question of what criteria employers should not use is\naddressed in discussions of discrimination.\n\nWhile there is some debate about whether discrimination in employment\nshould be legally prohibited (see Epstein 1992), almost everyone\nagrees that it is morally wrong (Hellman 2008; Lippert-Rasmussen\n2014). Discussion has focused on two questions. First, when does the\nuse of a certain criterion in an employment decision count as\ndiscriminatory? It would seem wrong if Walmart were to exclude white\napplicants for a job in their marketing department, but not wrong if\nthe Hovey Players (a theater troupe) were to exclude white applicants\nfor the role of Walter Younger in A Raisin in the Sun. We\nmight say that whether a hiring practice is discriminatory depends on\nwhether the criterion used is job-relevant. But the concept of\njob-relevance is contested, as the case of \u201creaction\nqualifications\u201d reveals. Suppose that white diners prefer to be\nserved by white waiters rather than black waiters. In this case race\nseems job-relevant, but it seems wrong for employers to take race into\naccount (Mason 2017). Another question that has received considerable\nattention is: What makes discrimination wrong? Some argue that\ndiscrimination is wrong because of its effects on those who are\ndiscriminated against (Lippert-Rasmussen 2014); others think that it\nis wrong because of what it expresses to them (Hellman 2008). (For\nextensive discussion, see the entry on\n discrimination.)\n\nSome writers believe that employers\u2019 obligations are not\nsatisfied simply by avoiding using certain criteria in hiring\ndecisions. According to them, employers have a duty to hire the most\nqualified applicant. Some justify this duty by appealing to\nconsiderations of desert (D. Miller 1999; Mulligan 2018); others\njustify it by appealing to equal opportunity (Mason 2006). We might\nobject to this view by appealing to property rights. A job offer\ntypically implies a promise to pay the job-taker a sum of your money\nfor performing certain tasks. While we might think that excluding some\nways you can dispose of your property (e.g., rules against\ndiscrimination in hiring) can be justified, we might think that\nexcluding all ways but one (viz., a requirement to hire the most\nqualified applicant) is unjustified. In support of this, we might\nthink that a small business owner does nothing wrong when she hires\nher daughter for a part-time job as opposed to a more qualified\nstranger.\n\nThe question of when employees may be fired is a staple of business\nethics texts and was the subject of considerable debate in the\nbusiness ethics literature in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s. There\nare two main views: those who think that employment should be\n\u201cat will\u201d, so that an employer can terminate an employee\nfor any reason (Epstein 1984; Maitland 1989), and those who think that\nemployers should be able to terminate employees only for \u201cjust\ncause\u201d (e.g., poor performance or excessive absenteeism) (McCall\n& Werhane 2010). In fact, few writers hold the \u201cpure\u201d\nversion of the \u201cat will\u201d view. Most would say, and the law\nagrees, that it is wrong for an employer to terminate an employee for\ncertain reasons, e.g., a discovery that he is Muslim or his refusal to\ncommit a crime for the employer. Thus the debate is between those who\nthink that employers should be able to terminate employees for any\nreason with some exceptions, and those who think that\nemployers should be able to terminate employees only for certain\nreasons. In the U.S., most employees are at will, while in Europe,\nmost employees are covered, after a probationary period, by something\nanalogous to just cause. Arguments for just cause appeal to the\neffects that termination has on individual employees, especially those\nwho have worked for an employer for many years (McCall & Werhane\n2010). Arguments for at will employment appeal to freedom or\nmacroeconomic effects. It is claimed, in the former case, that just\ncause is an unwarranted restriction on employers\u2019 and\nemployees\u2019 freedom of contract (Epstein 1984), and in the latter\ncase, that it raises the unemployment rate (Maitland 1989). The more\ndifficult it is for an employer to fire an employee, the more\nreluctant she will be to hire one in the first place.\n",
