    "main_text": "Five Fountainheads of Japanese Philosophy || Bushid\u014d (The Way of the Warrior)\n3.5 Bushid\u014d (The Way of the Warrior)\n\nThe fifth fountainhead of Japanese philosophy did not originate from\nabroad but bubbled up from within Japan itself in the modern period:\nbushid\u014d, the Way of the warrior. Although there had been\nedifying handbooks and martial codes in Japan for centuries preceding\nthe modern period, bushid\u014d was formalized only in the\nmodern period as a school of thought with a political, ethical, and\nethnic ideology in service of the state. Loyalty was originally a\ngeneralized lower-order Confucian virtue but bushid\u014d\ngave it a special meaning by linking it directly to the emperor and\nthe holographic paradigm supporting the imperial system in State\nShint\u014d. The emphasis on dying as the fullest expression of\nloyalty seems to have been most foregrounded in 1701 with the famous\nAk\u014d Incident of the Forty-seven Masterless Samurai, later\nvalorized in popular literature and dramatic performances. A\ncontributing factor in that cult of death may have been the emphasis\non the death of the ego-self in Zen Buddhism, a locution used by\nRinzai Zen masters in training unemployed samurai who joined the\nmonastery during the centuries of the Tokugawa peace. In addition\nbushid\u014d emphasized the value of makoto,\ngenuineness or trustworthiness, a term with originally Shint\u014d\nconnotations. Added to those native influences was the imported\nnineteenth-century European ideologies of ethnic virtue, the purity of\na given race of people as constituting the basis for a nation\nstate.\n\nBushid\u014d and National Morality\n\nBushid\u014d philosophy is, therefore, a true hybrid of\nConfucian, Buddhist, Shint\u014d, and European parentage.\nIdeologically it claimed to have been a philosophy of the Japanese\npeople harking back to ancient times but its parentage is clearly\nnineteenth century. Because of its hybridity, however, its history was\noccluded and its tenets were couched in terms deemed traditional but\noften given nuances they had not had previously. Hence,\nbushid\u014d was almost impervious to philosophical critique,\nespecially when it was protected by government censorship and\ninstitutionalized in the mandatory national educational curriculum for\nschool children called National Morality. In an important sense it is\nnot at all a philosophical stream comparable to the others, but its\nimpact should not be overlooked because it did affect the flow (and\nthe stagnation) of the other streams for the first half of the\ntwentieth century. That brings us to an overview of the eddies and\ncross-currents of the five streams in Japanese history.\n",
