    "preamble": "\n\nSometimes the term \u201cphenomenology\u201d is used to refer to the\nsubjective character of one\u2019s experiences or, as it is often\nglossed, their \u201cwhat-it\u2019s-likeness\u201d. Used in this\nway, one may, for instance, focus on the what-it\u2019s-likeness of a\nsharp pain one is currently experiencing and perhaps attempt to\ndescribe the subjective character of that pain\u2014its\nphenomenology. However, the term is also used as a label for a field\nof study, having a particular subject matter, methodology, and guiding\naim. This is how it will be used in this entry. Generally speaking,\nthen, moral phenomenology is a field of inquiry whose subject matter\nis moral experience in all its variety, whose aims are to provide\naccurate descriptions of such experience, guided by methods of\nfirst-person inquiry, and to explore the significance of moral\nphenomenology for select issues in metaethics and normative\nethics.\n\nThere are two dominant traditions within this field, one associated\nwith the phenomenological tradition initiated by Edmund Husserl, the\nother closely allied with work in the analytic philosophy of mind.\nThis entry will cover both traditions. Its aim is not to survey the\ndifferent moral theories proposed in the two traditions, but rather to\nprovide an account of the methodologies involved in moral\nphenomenology, to illustrate how these methodologies are applied in\nthe discussion of various types of moral experience, and to suggest\nways in which the results of these analyses address questions in\nmetaethics and normative ethics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Subject Matter and Methodology\n\nThere is a very narrow conception of the sorts of mental states and\nevents that could be the subject matter of phenomenological inquiry,\nnamely, \u201cfeeling\u201d mental states and events, including, as\nparadigm cases, types of physical and psychological pain. Because this\nis not how the subject matter is understood by those working on moral\nphenomenology, we put this narrow sense aside.\n\nAccording to a much broader conception of its subject matter,\nphenomenology as a field of inquiry is focused on the experiential\naspects of all types of experience that are accessible to first-person\ninquiry, including, for example, all forms of sensory experience,\nemotional experience, and so on. According to the tradition associated\nwith analytic philosophy of mind, the type of first-person inquiry in\nquestion is introspection (see the entry on\n introspection).\n Moral phenomenology, done in this tradition, then, focuses on the\nexperiential aspects of various types of moral experience\nthat are accessible to introspection. As a field of inquiry, its\ncentral aim is to accurately describe those aspects of moral\nexperience that may be investigated by the use of introspection. As\nsuch, it is largely an empirically grounded inquiry into the\nexperiential aspects of types of moral experience.\n\nAccording to the tradition derived from Husserl,\n Phenomenology[1]\n is focused on essential structures of the intentionality\u2014the\ndirectedness to an object\u2014proper to various kinds of experience.\nMoral phenomenology, understood in this sense, (1) focuses on what is\nessential to the first-personal, intentional directedness of moral\nexperiences, (2) aims to articulate the essences of types of moral\nexperience, and (3) employs a distinctive a priori\nmethodology.\n\nThese two conceptions of moral phenomenology as fields of inquiry\ndiffer somewhat in their aims and methodology, although they share a\ncommon subject matter. Let us begin with what they share in\ncommon.\n1.1 Varieties of moral experience\n\nHere we wish to propose in a somewhat preliminary way a general\ntaxonomy of types of moral experience\u2014a taxonomy that is\nintended to cover the territory well enough and is useful for thinking\nabout the subject matter of moral phenomenology.\n\nMoral perception includes moral experiences that crucially\ninvolve the use of one\u2019s perceptual faculties, ocular and\nauditory being the most obvious. An example of visual moral perception\nis seeing someone gleefully torture a helpless animal and experiencing\nthat action as morally wrong. Hearing someone utter a deliberately\ninsulting remark and recognizing it as such is an example of a moral\nexperience grounded in auditory perception. Understood more narrowly\n(and quite literally) moral perception, as understood by its\ndefenders, involves (what appears to one as) an instantiated moral\nproperty (i.e., an instance of a moral property possessed by an object\nof moral evaluation) being presented in one\u2019s perceptual\nexperience, as when one\u2019s visual perceptual experience presents\nthe injustice of a perceived action (see, for example, Audi\n 2013).[2]\n Moral perception, so understood, is to be distinguished (at least\nprima facie) from spontaneous, perceptually grounded moral\nbelief as when one sees someone slap a small child triggering the\nbelief that the slapping was morally wrong. Arguably, the content of\none\u2019s visual experience need not include the presentation of the\nproperty wrongness. (For further discussion of this issue, see\n section 2.1.)\n\nMoral emotions, both positive (e.g., gratitude, respect,\nadmiration) and negative (e.g., shame, guilt, indignation) are mental\nstates of moral significance that often have, when occurrent, a\nrobust, arguably complex, phenomenal character. In the empirical\nliterature, for example, one finds experimental studies of the\ndifferences in people\u2019s experiences of envy compared to\n jealousy,[3]\n of guilt compared to\n shame,[4]\n as well as studies of people\u2019s experiences of gratitude, of\ngenerosity, of disrespect, and other emotions. Note that if, as many\ntheoreticians of emotion suppose, moral judgments are embedded in\nthese emotions (or some instances of them), then the phenomenology of\nmoral emotion will overlap with the phenomenology of moral judgment.\nFor theorists who liken the emotions to perception, the phenomenology\nof moral emotion will overlap with the phenomenology of moral\nperception. Of course, for many theorists, the phenomenology of moral\nemotion will intersect both moral perception and moral judgment.\n\nMoral judgment is understood as occurrent experiences of\nthinking a moral proposition, whether it is about oneself, including\none\u2019s actions, past, present, or in prospect, or about\none\u2019s character, past, present, or future, or whether it is\nabout the actions or character of others, or whether it is about the\nstructures and behaviors of institutions. Within this category, many\nfurther divisions of phenomenological significance are called for. On\nphenomenological grounds, Maurice Mandelbaum (1955) distinguished what\nhe referred to as \u201cdirect\u201d from \u201cremoved\u201d\nmoral judgments\u2014intended to capture the difference in the\nphenomenologies of perspective between first and third-person moral\njudgment. He also found reason on phenomenological grounds to\ndistinguish judgments of obligation (and deontic judgments generally)\nfrom judgments of value. One might also suppose that spontaneous moral\njudgments (intuitions) typically have a different experiential aspect\nto them compared to moral judgments that are the deliverances of moral\n deliberation.[5]\n\nMoral deliberation includes formulating moral propositions\nand considering their plausibility (e.g., mulling them over, thinking\nabout reasons for and against), typically aimed at reaching a moral\nverdict about some issue. This category focuses on the conscious\nprocess often leading up to forming a moral judgment or leading up to\na decision to act based on one\u2019s deliberations\u2014both\ntypical products of this process.\n\nMoral agency involves exercising one\u2019s capacity to act,\nincluding the experience of making moral decisions (an exercise of\nwill), as well as experiences of planning, trying, striving, and\nacting in ways that have moral significance. Julia Annas (2008)\ndiscusses the experiences of a virtuous agent that she describes in\nterms of the sort of \u201cflow\u201d experience that is extensively\nexplored in the work of Csikszentmihalyi (1990). Hubert and Stuart\nDreyfus discuss what they call \u201cethical comportment\u201d, a\ndeveloped skill-like capacity in which an agent who has reached the\nrequisite level of moral expertise can see \u201cintuitively what to\ndo without applying rules and making judgments at all\u201d (1990:\n 243).[6]\n\nNotice two things about this taxonomy. First, these categories of\nmoral experience are porous, as indicated in what we have noted about\nthe possible involvement of moral judgment in experiencing moral\nemotions. Moral deliberation most often includes moral judgments that\none may or may not bring to mind in mulling over some moral issue to\nreach a verdict about that issue. Second, as indicated in the remarks\nabout moral judgment, there are more fine-grained distinctions one\nmight draw within and across the basic types of moral experience we\nhave just presented (e.g., direct vs. removed moral judgments) that\nmay be of phenomenological significance. The above taxonomy represents\nonly a rough guide to the most general types of moral experience. In\n section 3\n and\n 4,\n we return to the work that has been done investigating some of these\nspecies of moral experience as it bears on issues in metaethics and\nnormative ethics.\n1.2 Methodology\n\nThe methodology of phenomenological inquiry is first-personal.\nHowever, as noted at the outset of this section, the two\ntraditions\u2014analytic and Phenomenological\u2014differ\nfundamentally. The former is an empirically grounded, a\nposteriori philosophical science that proceeds by inductive and\nabductive methods. It aims to achieve general, psychological truths\nabout the first-personal character of moral experiences. The latter is\nan a priori philosophical science that proceeds via a\nsystematic consideration of the various parts and aspects of an\nexperience in order to identify which of them are essential to the\nexperience being the kind of experience it is. It achieves\n(presumptively) necessary truths about the correlation between the\nintentionally directed experience and its object just as experienced\n(see below), including the first-personal character of its\nexperiential dimension and the structural components of the object and\nits significance for the subject. Let us consider these differences in\nmore detail.\n\nPhenomenological inquiry in the analytic tradition relies on\nintrospection as the basis for observing aspects of one\u2019s moral\nexperience, which can then be used for making psychological\ngeneralizations about such experience. Here, it is important to\ndistinguish two uses of introspectionist methodology. One use is\ndirect: one attends to some aspect of one\u2019s ongoing experience\nin order to describe what one observes. By turning one\u2019s\nattention inward, as it were, one can attend to the pain in\none\u2019s thumb and describe it as, say, dull or sharp. Likewise, by\nattending to one\u2019s occurrent emotional experience, one can\nimmediately determine that one is experiencing anger directed toward\nsome wrongful behavior one just witnessed.\n\nHowever, this use of introspection is of limited value when it comes\nto addressing certain philosophical controversies. One such\ncontroversy in the philosophy of perception is whether visual\nperceptual experiences have \u201crich contents\u201d. According to\na rich content view, visual experiences can and often do present the\ninstantiation in perceptual awareness not just of lower-level physical\nproperties such as colors, shapes, illumination, and motion, but also\nsuch experiences can and typically do also present the instantiation\nof higher-level properties including, for instance, properties that\ncategorize objects (cars, cacti, clouds), actions (starting a car,\nplanting a cactus, pointing to a cloud) and causal relations. But as\nSusanna Siegel (2011: chap. 3), a defender of the rich content view,\npoints out, the controversy over this view cannot be settled by the\ndirect use of introspection; one cannot reliably tell just by\nattending carefully to one\u2019s visual experience whether its\nperceptual contents are rich. But this does not mean that\nintrospection is of no use. Rather, it figures importantly in\nphenomenal contrast arguments. There is a variety of such arguments\nthat differ importantly in their probative power that need not concern\nus\n here.[7]\n Generally speaking, such arguments draw a conclusion about the\nphenomenal character of a certain type of experience, by appealing to\na phenomenal difference of some sort between two experiences being\ncompared. For example, in defending the claim that visual experiences\npresent one with object kinds, Siegel contrasts one\u2019s visual\nexperience of pine trees, situated among other trees in a forest,\nbefore acquiring the disposition to easily recognize pine trees, with\none\u2019s visual experience of the forest after acquiring the\ndisposition. Siegel points to a \u201cfeeling of familiarity\u201d\nin one\u2019s overall phenomenology in the second experience that is\nsalient to introspection. This introspectable difference figures in a\npremise in an abductive argument (i.e., inference to the best\nexplanation) for the claim that one\u2019s visual experience after\ngaining the appropriate recognitional disposition includes the\npresentation of pine tree, an instance supporting the rich content\nview, which then generalizes to a wide range of visual experiences.\nIntrospection plays an ineliminable role in phenomenal contrast\narguments. However, at least as employed by Siegel in defending the\nrich content view, its use is to reveal something reliably detectable\nabout one\u2019s contrasting experiences, which can then provide the\nbasis for an argument to a conclusion about phenomenal character.\n\nTurning for a moment to moral experience, one controversy (which we\ndiscuss below in\n section 2),\n is whether certain types of moral perceptual experience purport to\npresent instantiated moral properties. If so, and if one takes such\nexperience to bear on philosophical disputes over moral metaphysics,\nthen one can appeal to such experiences as providing presumptive\nevidence for some form of moral realism. Suppose, though, that one\ncannot reliably tell by directly introspecting one\u2019s moral\nexperiences whether they have such realist purport. One might then\nhope to provide evidence that such experiences do have such purport by\nemploying a phenomenal contrast argument.\n\nOf course, there are important questions about the nature and\nreliability of introspectionist methodology. (We refer readers to the\nentries on introspection and on self-knowledge for relevant\ndiscussions.) The important points for present purposes are these.\nFirst, the role introspection plays in addressing\nphilosophical disputes may vary, the basic division being between\ndirect methods and the method that employs phenomenal contrast\narguments. Second, the uses of introspection in the analytic tradition\nare intended to yield empirically grounded psychological claims about\nthe phenomenal character of moral experiences, employing, inductive\nand abductive methods. As we have already noted, this empirically\ngrounded methodology and its aims differ sharply from the methods and\naims one finds in the Phenomenological tradition to which we now\nturn.\n\nThe methodology of Phenomenology as initiated by Husserl involves\nthree key aspects: (1) a specification of the main theme for\nphenomenological reflection, namely, intentionality (the feature of\nexperience whereby it is directed upon an object); (2) a description\naimed at revealing the necessary constituents of the correlation\nbetween intentionally directed experiences and their objects just as\nexperienced, that is, in their significance for the subject , and (3)\na methodology involving imaginative variation, governed by a\nwhole-part logic, of the parts and aspects of the correlation.\n\nThe specification of the main theme of phenomenology as intentionality\nis a result of exercising the \u201cphenomenological reduction\u201d\n(Husserl 1913: \u00a7\u00a730\u201384). Without entering into the\nvarious debates about the possibility, extent, and significance of the\nreduction\u2014all of which are disputed\u2014the minimal sense of\nthe reduction common to Phenomenologists is the suspension of\none\u2019s participation in the belief in the existence of the world\n(and the objects therein), a belief characteristic of our\nstraightforward, everyday experience of the world. Husserl (1913:\n\u00a731) also uses the term \u201cbracketing\u201d in speaking of\nthe reduction, and this provides a useful metaphor. Just as absolute\ntwo, represented as [2], is the number two without a positive or\nnegative index, the reduced experience\u2014say, [perceiving the\ntable]\u2014is the experience along with its object as meant, as\nsignificant for us in a particular manner, without the index of\nexistence or non-existence. Some Phenomenologists (e.g., Scheler\n1913/1916) reject the deployment of the reduction because they wish to\npreserve a strong realism regarding the existence of values, and they\nbelieve the reduction commits one to a form of metaphysical\nidealism.\n\nAlternatively and more generally, we can say the reduction focuses\nattention upon the object intended in experience simply as\nexperienced. Either formulation captures the correlation of experience\nand its object. The reduction, in other words, is a reflective turn\nthat leads our attention away from the object as given in everyday\nexperience back (re-ducere) to the correlation\u2014what we\ncall the \u201cintentional correlation\u201d\u2014between the\nexperience intending the object and the object just in the manner it\nis experienced. It leads our attention back to the experiences in\nwhich objects have meaning for us. At the same time, the reduction\nreveals the correlational inseparability of the phenomenal content\nproper to the experiential, subjective side of the correlation and the\nintentional content proper to the objective side of the\n correlation.[8]\n\nThe second and third aspects of the Phenomenological method are joined\nin the idea of descriptive analysis carried out in terms of a\nwhole-part logic that (1) identifies the parts or aspects of the\nexperience, its object, and the correlation itself, and (2)\nimaginatively varies the whole by thinking away different parts or\naspects of the whole to determine which of them must be\npresent for the experience or object to remain the kind of experience\nor object that it is. Stated more formally, imaginative variation\nsystematically varies the whole under consideration (W) by\ntrying to imagine it first without part A, then without part\nB, then without part C, and so forth. If W\ncan be imagined without part A and still be considered a\nW, then A is a \u201cpiece\u201d that does not\nbelong necessarily and universally to Ws. If, by contrast,\nW cannot be imagined without part B, then B\nis a \u201cmoment\u201d of W and belongs necessarily and\nuniversally to Ws. The existence of any W entails\nthe presence of B (Husserl 1900\u20131901 [2001:\n2:5\u20137]). The deployment of this methodology yields a\npriori truths regarding the necessary and universal features of\nthe intentionality proper to different kinds of experiences.\n\nThe inability to imagine the separate existence of a moment is not\nmerely a psychological limitation of the human imagination. It is\ninstead a rational inability to separate specific logical (conceptual)\ncontents from one another. The necessity of moments supplementing and\ncomplementing one another in the formation of a whole arises out of a\nnecessity in the nature of the things themselves, a necessity in the\nsense of the moments themselves (Husserl 1900\u20131901 [2001:\n2:11]). Consider, for example, the moral emotion of guilt: guilt\ninvolves distressing feelings about something one has done and knows\nor thinks to be wrong. If one tries to think away the feelings of\ndistress, one would not recognize the emotion as guilt, and if one\ntries to think away the knowledge or thought that what one did was\nwrong, one would again not recognize the emotion as guilt. Feelings of\ndistress and the recognition of wrongdoing are moments of\u2014that\nis, essential to\u2014guilt.\n\nThe majority of Phenomenologists do not engage in the kind of detailed\nmethodological reflections that Husserl did. However, virtually all\nPhenomenologists employ something like the minimal notion of the\nphenomenological turn to the intentional correlation as the whole that\nis under investigation and seek to identify the essential constituents\nof experience and its objects as experienced. Moreover, virtually all\nPhenomenologists utilize an analysis of whole-part relations, even if\nthey do not use the terms, in order to discover essential features of\nthe correlation itself, as well as of its experiential and objective\nmoments. Since the whole under investigation is not a psychological\nsubject\u2014that is, a particular worldly subject\u2014but any\npossible subject, and since the method discloses necessary and\nuniversal structures that make the experiences the kind of experience\nthey are, the result is an a priori Phenomenology.\n2. Moral Phenomenology and Metaethics\n\nMetaethics addresses second-order questions about morality, including\nmetaphysical, epistemological, and semantic questions (see the entry\non\n metaethics).\n Phenomenological questions about moral experience significantly\nimpact views on these topics. If, for instance, some form of moral\nexperience has as an aspect of its presentational\n content[9]\n putatively instantiated moral properties (e.g., wrongness) or\nrelations (e.g., fittingness), this would be some evidence in favor of\na realist moral\n metaphysics.[10]\n Also, such experiences would arguably provide an experiential basis\nfor justified moral belief and perhaps moral knowledge. And, if moral\nexperience presents such properties and relations as aspects of their\ncontent, this would invite a moral semantics according to which\njudgments in which a moral property or relation is predicated of some\nitem of moral evaluation are truth-apt. Such issues bear on the\nquestion of whether ethics is or can be an \u201cobjective\u201d\nenterprise.\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we review some of the debates\nconcerning the bearing of moral phenomenology on metaethical issues.\nWe organize our review according to what we identified earlier as\nmajor types of moral experience, beginning with moral perception.\n2.1 Moral perception\n\nMoral perception has recently become a major topic of interest among\nanalytic philosophers and, in this sub-section, we will confine our\nremarks to how it has been discussed in such circles. In the following\nsub-sections, we focus primarily on the Phenomenological\ntradition.\n\nAs noted earlier, the phenomenological issue concerning moral\nperception is whether human beings can perceive instantiated moral\nproperties or relations, in the sense that such properties and\nrelations are presented in experience as part of the content of what\nan individual literally sees or hears (to pick two sense\n modalities).[11]\n\nTo clarify the topic under consideration, three comments are in order.\nFirst, our use of \u201cmoral perception\u201d in this sub-section\nis confined to modes of perception associated with the five senses\nplus proprioception and excludes consideration of other mental\nphenomena such as emotions which, on some accounts, are perceptual or\nquasi-perceptual states. (Moral emotions are taken up in the following\nsub-section.) Second, contemporary discussion of moral perception\ncenters on whether it is possible to perceive moral properties without\npostulating a special moral sense for detecting moral\n properties.[12]\n Third, it is assumed (though by no means uncontroversial) that\nperceptual experience has informational content understood as\nproviding accuracy conditions of one\u2019s perceptual experience,\nanalogous to truth conditions for beliefs (see the entry on the\n contents of perception).\n Thus, if I\u2019m having a visual experience as of a red object\nspatially located on the table in front of me, then my visual\nexperience includes as part of its content the presentation of the\nproperty redness and is thus accurate in this regard just in case the\nobject I am looking at is red.\n\nTurning now to moral perception, earlier we alluded to a now-famous\nexample from Gilbert Harman:\n\n\nIf you round a corner and see a group of hoodlums pour gasoline on a\ncat and ignite it, you do not need to conclude that what they\nare doing is wrong; you do not need to figure anything out; you can\nsee that it is wrong. (Harman 1977: 4)\n\n\nThere are at least two ways to understand Harman\u2019s remark. One\nmay take it as the claim that the property of wrongness is part of the\npresentational content of one\u2019s visual experience, alongside\none\u2019s visual experience of seeing the group of hoodlums pour\ngasoline on a cat and igniting it. This understanding commits one to\nwhat we will call the thesis of moral perception (MP, for\nshort) according to which at least some moral properties can figure in\nthe presentational contents of ordinary veridical perception. On this\nview, it is possible to see the wrongness of what those kids\nare doing. Moral perception is not restricted to visual perception,\nbut examples of such putative perception dominate the literature.\n\nAn alternative understanding of Harman\u2019s cat example is that one\ndoes not perceive the wrongness in question, rather what one sees in\nrounding the corner are the non-moral descriptive properties one\nwitnesses (e.g., the kids pouring gasoline) that spontaneously\ntriggers the response \u201cthat\u2019s wrong!\u201d However, the\nproperty of wrongness is not part of the content of one\u2019s visual\nperception. On this interpretation, then, saying that one sees\nthat what those kids are doing is wrong should be understood as a\nkind of intellectual seeing, i.e., a matter of intellectually (and, in\nthe example, spontaneously) apprehending the relation between what one\nsees and the wrongness of the act\u2014a mental act downstream (or at\nleast distinct) from one\u2019s visual experience.\n\nIn twentieth century analytic metaethics it was long accepted that\nmoral properties cannot be perceived, even if they are instantiated in\nactions, persons, institutions, and other items of moral evaluation.\nThus, we find W. D. Ross remarking:\n\n\nRightness is always a resultant attribute, an attribute that an act\nhas because it has another. It is not an attribute that its subject is\njust directly perceived in experience to have, as I perceive a\nparticular extended patch to be yellow, or a particular noise to be\nloud. (Ross 1939: 168)\n\n\nSuppose, following Ross, moral properties (assuming they are ever\ninstantiated) are higher-order resultant properties\u2014properties\nwhose instantiation depends on descriptive base properties. In this\npicture, it is in virtue of such descriptive properties as the\nhoodlums intending to torture the cat and igniting it that what they\nare doing instantiates the property of wrongness. Further, suppose\nRoss is correct in claiming that moral properties, even if they are\nsometimes instantiated, are not presented in visual experience (to\npick one sensory modality) as are low-level properties such as color\nand sound. Might it still be true that one\u2019s visual experience\nincludes as part of its presentational content resultant moral\nproperties even if they aren\u2019t perceived in the way one\nperceives color and sound? Recent work on perception gives the\ndefender of moral perception some reason to be optimistic.\n\nIn\n section 1.2\n on methodology, we mentioned the method of phenomenal contrast and\nhow it is used by some in defense of the rich content view of ordinary\nvisual perception. On this view, what is or can be presented in\nordinary visual experience is not restricted to lower-level properties\nsuch as shape, color, illumination, and motion, but may include the\npresentation of higher-level descriptive properties including object\nkinds, causal relations, and actions. (Siegel\u2019s pine tree\nexample is often cited as an example of how the method is deployed in\ndefense of the rich content view.) This recent development in the\nphilosophy of perception has figured in some recent defenses of\n MP.[13]\n\nThe question in the context of recent developments in the philosophy\nof perception, then, is whether this rich content view can be extended\nto moral properties\u2014higher-order normative moral\nproperties (and perhaps to normative and evaluative properties\ngenerally). The matter is controversial, as one might expect. For\nexample, Preston Werner (2016) employs the contrast method\n(\u00e0 la Siegel) in defense of MP. He considers two\nindividuals witnessing the Harman cat incident and differing in their\noverall resulting phenomenology because one of them (Pathos) lacks the\ncapacity for emotional empathic responses to cases like Harman\u2019s\ncat that the other person (Norma) has. Werner then proceeds to argue\nthat from among the candidate explanations for the interpersonal\ndifference in the experiences of Pathos and Norma, the hypothesis that\nthe visual experience of Norma includes as part of its presentational\ncontent the property of wrongness (presumably not present in the\nvisual experience of Pathos) best explains the phenomenological\ndifference in question. Werner\u2019s defense of MP is opposed by\nPekka V\u00e4yrynen (2018) who advances a two-pronged reply. First,\neven if Norma\u2019s experience of witnessing the cat immolation\nincludes a presentation of the property of wrongness as part of the\ncontent of her overall experience, Werner\u2019s argument\ndoes not show that the property is an element of the presentational\ncontent of her visual experience that is included as a part\nof her overall experience, i.e., it doesn\u2019t show that she\nsees the wrongness. Second, V\u00e4yrynen proposes a\ncompeting hypothesis according to which Norma undergoes a spontaneous\ninferential transition from non-moral perceptual input (together with\nbackground beliefs with moral content, training, and habituation) to\nher moral judgment about the hoodlums (this spontaneous response\nlacking in Pathos). He then argues that this hypothesis is overall\nsimpler, more unified, and enjoys greater explanatory power compared\nto the MP hypothesis. (For pertinent details, readers may consult the\narticles by Werner and V\u00e4yrynen.) This particular dispute, we\nnote, is far from settled; questions may be raised about the alleged\nsuperiority of V\u00e4yrynen\u2019s proposal over MP.\n\nFurther questions about moral perception loom large, including whether\nso-called thick moral properties, e.g., honesty, are better candidates\nfor figuring in the presentational contents of perceptual experiences\nthan are \u201cthin\u201d moral properties like rightness and\nwrongness. After all, concepts like honesty are at least partly\ndescriptive (making them \u201cthick\u201d) and partly evaluative or\nnormative. For instance, knowingly witnessing someone\u2019s action\nof interpersonal verbal communication as honest is (in part) to be\npresented with specific descriptive information about the\naction\u2014that it was neither a lie nor in some way deceptive. As\nsuch, the property of honesty is capable of being presented\nauditorily. Insofar as honesty is a right-making property of actions,\nexperiencing the honesty with the understanding that it is\nright-making, would seem to be a case of experiencing a moral\nproperty; the moral property is presented in experience by way of its\ndescriptive content.\n\nAnother looming question is whether one would be able to perceive\nmoral properties were they non-natural properties. Robert Audi (2013),\nfor example, defends a non-naturalist view of moral properties as\nbeing (in his terminology) \u201cperceptible\u201d. (See Crow 2016\nfor a critical discussion of Audi and related views of moral\nperception.) Finally, another question, fundamental to the debate over\nthe thesis of moral perception, is whether it is possible to determine\nby introspectionist methodology alone (including the method of\ncontrast) whether at least some perceptual experiences include as part\nof their content the presentation of moral properties\u2014whether as\nTerry Horgan and Mark Timmons put it, such experiences have\n\u201crealist purport\u201d. In a series of articles (2008b, 2010b,\n2017, 2018a,b, 2019), they defend a \u201cneutrality thesis\u201d\naccording to which for a variety of types of moral experience it is\nnot possible to determine by introspectionist methodology\nalone whether such experiences have realist purport. Their\npoint, if cogent, arguably generalizes to all types of moral\nexperience, including perceptual experience of the sort featured in\nHarman\u2019s cat example, even if such experiences do have realist\npurport.\n\nIn the remainder of this section, our central focus will be on the\nPhenomenological tradition, with some mention of the work by analytic\nphilosophers.\n2.2 Moral emotion\n\nSome Phenomenologists approach the analysis of feelings and emotions\nthrough the theory of value (axiology) [e.g., Edmund Husserl\n(1908\u20139/1911/1914, 1920/1924, 1916\u201335), Nicolai Hartmann\n(1926), Alexius Meinong (1917), Adolf Reinach (1912/1913), Max Scheler\n(1913/1916), Edith Stein (1917), and Dietrich von Hildebrand (1916,\n1922, 1953)]. (For additional information, see the entries on\n Edmund Husserl,\n phenomenology,\n the phenomenology of the Munich and G\u00f6ttingen Circles,\n Nicolai Hartmann,\n Alexius Meinong,\n Adolf Reinach,\n Max Scheler,\n and\n Edith Stein.)\n For these Phenomenologists moral perception and moral emotion merge\nin experiencing value properties in general and moral properties in\nparticular. They agree that only beings capable of feelings or\nemotions can grasp values and the significance attaching to them.\nHarman\u2019s cat example illustrates this. It is clear that we see\nthe cat and someone performing actions that seriously injure the\nhelpless animal. This is an ordinary perception of the features and\nactions of worldly beings. We also \u201csee\u201d the wrongness of\nthese actions in the disgust or horror that we feel. This is what\naxiological Phenomenologists mean when they claim that the value is\n\u201cperceived\u201d by an intentional feeling or an emotion.\n\nThese Phenomenologists also agree that intentional feelings or\nemotions grasp value-objects independent of those feelings, in the\nsense that neither a thing\u2019s being valuable nor the truth or\nfalsity of value attributions is reducible to or solely dependent upon\nthe intentional feeling. There are important differences, however, in\nhow Phenomenologists understand the relation between the\n\u201cmere\u201d perceiving of material things and experiencing the\nvalue property and how they understand the independence of the\nvalue-object. These differences are tied to different understandings\nof the German term\n wertnehmen,[14]\n which parallels wahrnehmen, to perceive. Focusing on the\naspect of \u201ctaking\u201d\u2014nehmen\u2014common to\nperceiving and valuing emphasizes their relation. A taking is a\nsingle, unified experience having two distinguishable aspects, a\ntaking as true and a taking as valuable. The truth-taking and the\nvalue-taking occur together even as they remain distinguishable.\nAlthough their focus is on value in general, these Phenomenologists\nagree that the emotions have moral relevance and that our choices are\nin some manner rooted in the emotional disclosure of the value of both\nthe ends at which the agent aims and the actions conducive to those\nends. By extension, therefore, and despite differing accounts of the\nexperience of value, they also view themselves as moral realists (see\nthe entry on\n moral realism).\n\nOn one view\u2014a \u201cweak\u201d or response-dependent value\nrealism\u2014to perceive a value (wertnehmen) is for an\nintentional feeling or\n emotion[15]\n to grasp an entity (e.g., a thing, state of affairs, action, event,\nperson, institution) as valued\u2014or, as in the case of\nHarman\u2019s cat example, disvalued. Someone\u2019s horror upon\nseeing the boys burning the cat takes the burning of the cat by the\nboys as dastardly. The (dis)value of the boys\u2019 action is\ngrounded in the particular, non-axiological features involved (the\nboys\u2019 pouring gasoline on the cat and igniting the gasoline),\nwhich, relative to the experiential history, interests, concerns, and\ncommitments (including moral) of the subject, are taken to be\n(dis)valuable. Just as the perception of a thing S takes\nS as p (the cat as having gasoline poured\non it and ignited by the group of boys), the feeling-apprehension or\nemotional apprehension takes Sp as v (the\ncat\u2019s being burned by the boys as horrible). The non-axiological\nproperty p psychologically motivates the experience of the\nemotion with its correlative value property, and p also\nepistemically (and, contra V\u00e4yrynen 2018,\nnon-inferentially) justifies the value-attribution. And just as the\nperceptual taking of S as p (the cat as\nhaving gasoline poured on it and ignited by the group of boys)\nincludes the naive belief in the existence of Sp (has realist\npurport), the feeling or emotional apprehension of Sp as v\n(the cat\u2019s having been burned by the boys as horrible) includes\nthe naive belief in the existence of Sp along with its\nvalue-attribute v. Feelings and emotions, in other words, are\na kind of axiological perception revelatory of value-properties.\n\nThe notion of taking something as valuable, on this view, entails that\na value is in the first instance just the object experienced as\nvaluable rather than the value-property alone or an abstract\nvalue-object of some kind. Finally, since these takings are\npre-predicative, the term \u201cvalue-perception\u201d or\n\u201cvalue-taking\u201d (Wertnehmung) further entails that\nfeelings and emotions as evaluative experiences need not involve\npropositional content (although they can and, perhaps more often than\nnot, do). In other words, a belief or judgment (even a value judgment)\ncan provide the underlying basis for an (additional) experience of\nvalue, in which case the feeling-apprehension or emotion takes\n[that S is p] as\n v.[16]\n For more detailed discussion of this view, see Drummond 1995, 2013,\n2017; Husserl 1908\u20139/1911/1914; Loidolt 2010, 2011, 2018; Melle\n1991, 1992, 1997, 2007; Peucker 2011; Rinofner-Kreidl 2013; and\nVendrell Ferran 2008, 2013. For analyses along these lines of\nparticular moral emotions, see Drummond 2018a, 2020b; Hein\u00e4maa\n2014, 2018; M. Kelly 2016a, 2016b, 2016c; Ozar 2009, 2010, 2018;\nRinofner-Kreidl 2014a, 2014b, 2018; and Vendrell Ferran 2018a.\n\nA second view\u2014a \u201cstrong\u201d or response-independent\nvalue realism\u2014holds that intentional feelings directly apprehend\na priori values ontologically and epistemologically prior to\nexperiencing any particular object as a bearer of value (Scheler\n1913/1916; Hartmann 1926; Mulligan 2010; Steinbock 2014, von\nHildebrand 1916). On this view, intentional feelings and emotions\nseparate. Intentional feelings apprehend the a priori value\nitself; they provide access to the domain of values and to their\nhierarchy, which\u2014to use Scheler\u2019s example (1913/1916\n[1973: 86\u2013100])\u2014ascends from sensory values (the agreeable\nand the disagreeable) to vital values (e.g., the noble and the\nvulgar), spiritual values (e.g., the beautiful and the ugly, the true\nand the false), and, at the apex, the holy and the unholy. Values and\nthis hierarchy \u201cflash before us\u201d (Scheler 1913/1916 [1973:\n68]) in loving and hating (the two basic feelings) and in preferring\nand placing behind or after. Emotions, by contrast, do not reveal\nvalue in the way intentional feelings do. They are the subject\u2019s\nresponses to the felt value. Von Hildebrand makes the point\nclearly:\n\n\nI see a child mistreated on the street and a terrible outrage rises\nwithin me. I am outraged by the vulgarity and brutality of this\nbehavior. The outrage is clearly [\u2026] a response to these\nqualities with which I am already familiar (emphasis added).\n(von Hildebrand 1916 [1973: 137])\n\n\nThe feeling-apprehension of the a priori (dis)value underlies\nthe grasp of an object as a good (or bad). The felt value is the\ngood-making characteristic of the object valued as good or the\nbad-making characteristic of the object valued as bad. Contra\nthe \u201cweak\u201d view, however, the value itself does not depend\non the features of the object that is the bearer of the value. While\nvalued objects (goods), considered as objects of desire, are\nempirical, variable, and subjective, the values themselves are not;\nthey are a priori, immutable, and objective ideals. The\nperceptual experience of the bearer is only contingently related\nto\u2014that is, is the occasion for\u2014the feeling-apprehension\nof the value. Aspects of this view are analyzed and developed in\nBarber 1993; Bartky 1997; Blosser 1987, 1995, 2005, 2012; Davis 2009,\n2012; Frings 1996, 1997; E. Kelly 1977, 2011; Schneck 1987; Spader\n2002; Steinbock 2007, 2013, 2014, 2016; and Vendrell Ferran 2018b.\n\nThe difference between the two views of moral emotion can be\ncharacterized as follows: On the first view, being outraged at the\nmistreatment of the child just is to see the treatment of the child\nwith its non-axiological features as vulgar and brutal. On the second\nview, seeing the mistreatment of the child and feeling the disvalues\n\u201cvulgar\u201d and \u201cbrutal\u201d, I respond with outrage\ndirected at the child\u2019s mistreatment.\n\nFinally, in the analytic tradition, one also finds views featuring\naffect (Johnston 2001), moral emotion (D\u00f6ring 2003), desires\n(Oddie 2005), and experiences of pain (Bain 2013) as modes of\nexperiential access to moral properties, and so in this respect such\nviews are allied with the Phenomenological work just surveyed.\n2.3 Moral judgment\n\nWe have seen in the preceding section that Phenomenologists understand\na feeling\u2019s or moral emotion\u2019s apprehension of a value as\ntied to the perception of an entity under a certain aspect or under a\ncertain description, for example, the boys\u2019 torturing the cat.\nThe moral emotion, in other words, apprehends the boys\u2019\ntorturing the cat as wrong. The as\u2014what\nPhenomenologists often call the \u201chermeneutic\nas\u201d\u2014demarcates the entity and the value-aspect\nunder which it is experienced. Focusing attention on the aspect or\ndescription under which the object is experienced, the subject\nrecognizes it as a feature of the object or as belonging to the object\nand, conversely, recognizes that the object is as described\nor has the feature in question. In short, the as\npoints to an is or a has; seeing the torturing\nas wrong points to the judgment that the torturing\nis wrong. It is the attending to the aspect and the explicit\nrecognition of it as an aspect that produces the judgment affirming\nthe relation between the entity and the aspect. The judgment thus\nintroduces a new sense beyond what is contained in the moral emotion.\nThere is an affirmation of the distinction between and the unity of\nthe entity and its aspect, that is, an explicit affirmation of the\nobject\u2019s being a certain way and as having value on the\nground of its being that way (Husserl 1900\u20131901 [2001:\n2:278\u2013280, 286\u2013289]). There is a shift from\nseeing the boys\u2019 wrongfully torturing the cat (that is,\nseeing their torturing the cat as wrong) to seeing\nthat the boys\u2019 torturing the cat is wrong. The\nshift is from an attributive mode of experience to a predicative one.\n(Husserl 1900\u20131901 [2001: 2:273]), and the boys torturing the\ncat is now explicitly brought under the concept\n\u201cwrong\u201d.\n\nOne question about the phenomenology of moral judgment is whether\nexperiences of making a moral judgment have a phenomenal essence in\nthe sense that there is some phenomenal property (or properties) that\nsuch experiences have in common and that serves to distinguish them\nfrom experiences of making non-moral judgments. Mandelbaum, whose work\nin ethics links the Phenomenological and analytic traditions, defended\nthis kind of essentialism. As noted earlier, he drew a\nphenomenological distinction between \u201cdirect\u201d moral\nexperiences of obligation and \u201cremoved\u201d moral experiences.\nThe former type is where one judges that one is morally obligated to\neither do or refrain from performing an action that is called for in\none\u2019s immediate circumstances. Mandelbaum describes this\nphenomenon as involving a \u201creflexive felt demand\u201d\nemanating from one\u2019s immediate circumstances (rather than from\none\u2019s antecedent preferences) directed toward oneself and\ngrounded in one\u2019s sense of a particular response best fitting\nthe circumstances. Because the source of the felt demand is\none\u2019s circumstances and not one\u2019s preferences, judgments\ngrounded in this kind of demand are experienced as objective. Removed\nmoral judgments, by contrast, are of two sorts and include judgments\nof obligation about one\u2019s past self and about others, as well as\njudgments about the goodness and badness of character traits (virtues\nand vices). Supposing that direct and removed kinds of moral\nexperience exhaust the realm of judgment-involving moral experiences,\nthe question is whether there is something essential to all such\nexperiences that unifies and distinguishes them from experiences\ninvolving non-moral judgments.\n\nMandelbaum argued that\n\n\nall moral judgments are grounded in our apprehension of relations of\nfittingness or unfittingness between the responses of a human being\nand the demands which inhere in the situation by which he is\nfaced.\n\n\nThey constitute, as he says, a \u201csingle genus\u201d\n(1955: 181). He thus apparently thought that the realm of\njudgment-involving moral experiences enjoys a phenomenological\nsignature\u2014an essence. Of course, even if Mandelbaum is mistaken\nabout the entire range of judgment-involving moral experiences, it\nmight be true that, for example, direct moral experiences enjoy a\nphenomenal essence. For recent discussions of Mandelbaum on this issue\nof essence, see Horgan and Timmons 2005, 2008a; Gill 2008;\nSinnott-Armstrong 2008; and Glasgow 2013.\n\nMandelbaum considered his phenomenological approach to moral\ntheorizing crucial for uncovering universally correct moral norms\nwithout begging questions for or against competing views about such\nnorms. His phenomenological description as of direct moral obligations\ncoming from one\u2019s external circumstances as opposed to being\nexperienced as grounded in one\u2019s desires and aversions, favored\nsome form of moral\n realism.[17]\n Mandelbaum also took his phenomenological inquiry to favor a\ndeontological normative ethical theory, about which we say more below\nin\n section 3.\n2.4 Moral deliberation\n\nFor the Phenomenological axiologists, deliberation bridges the\naxiological and practical spheres. It begins in the evaluation of the\n(apparent) goods we might pursue in action and of the (possible)\nactions conducive to them. Most importantly, deliberation identifies\nthose ends that appear as ones to which an agent might commit herself\nin order to give meaning and significance to her life as a whole.\nDeliberation terminates in the choice to pursue particular ends and to\nundertake particular actions in that pursuit. Deliberation involves\nreflection and reason. The subject deliberatively determines which\nend(s) she will pursue given her abilities, interests, and concerns as\nwell as which actions best conduce to the chosen ends given the\nparticulars of the situation in which she is to act.\n\nRicoeur (1950 [2007: 137ff.]) speaks of decision as having a\n\u201chistory\u201d and points to what he calls\n\u201chesitation\u201d as central to this history. From one point of\nview, the capacity for choice manifests itself in hesitation, the\nwavering between different possibilities for projects or for actions.\nFrom another point of view, hesitation is an\n\u201cin-decision\u201d, as a \u201cfalling short of choice\u201d,\nas a being-on-the-way to a choice, which, as of yet, is absent or\ndeferred. \u201cHesitation\u201d, Ricoeur says, \u201cis a\nperplexed willing seeking to orient itself\u201d (1950 [2007: 138]).\nThe decision identifies one of these possibilities as my\nproject, as the possibility I will pursue in my voluntary,\nself-motivated action that executes the decision. The decision\narticulates a project, but the project is different from the voluntary\nbodily action that realizes it. Although a decision can be separated\nin time from the action, in which case it is the capability of acting\nin conformity with the project that makes it an authentic decision, an\naction can also be spontaneous. The spontaneous action, however, is\ngenuinely a voluntary action only insofar as the agent could have\nprojected it in a situation to which the action is suitable or with\nwhich it is compatible. Put another way, the action is voluntary only\nwhen the agent can recognize an implicit decision in it, a decision\nwith its history of hesitation that could be affirmed as the potential\nproject of the action in question.\n\nSuch descriptions are well suited to explicit deliberation concurrent\nor continuous with the action, and they are well suited to means-ends\narguments about what to do. This view of deliberation was embedded in\na German law that led Adolf Reinach (1912/1913 [1989: 279]) to\nidentify some \u201cremarkable antinomies\u201d in our understanding\nof deliberation, one of which is that meritorious actions count as\nless meritorious when done without any deliberation or when done only\nafter long deliberation. If the agent takes no time to deliberate, the\nagent acts impetuously; if the agent takes too much time in\ndeliberating, the agent is insufficiently attuned to what is right to\ndo in certain kinds of circumstances. However, if deliberation is\nviewed less as an occurrent rational calculation, Reinach\u2019s\nparadoxical conclusion can be avoided.\n\nNot all actions are the result of explicit deliberation. There are\nvarious ways reasons for action might be at work in action, ways that\nmight involve, say, views about the constituents of an end or views\nabout what conduces to an end. Moral agents inherit a set of views\nthat come to govern their actions without further deliberation. A\nreflective moral agent strives toward confirming for herself these\ninherited judgments, beliefs, and emotional attitudes regarding moral\ngoods and moral actions, and on this basis, she adopts, rejects, or\nrevises them. They thereby take on the character not merely of\npassively accepted moral beliefs but of justified moral convictions,\nand the agent realizes herself as a person having a particular set of\nconvictions for which the appropriate evidence has been secured and\nwhich now defines her character. These convictions inform her\nsubsequent judgments, valuations, and volitions, disposing her to act\nin determinate ways. Having over time already reflectively weighed the\nvalue of competing goods and the rightness or wrongness of various\nkinds of actions, a reflective agent, just as much as the agent who\npassively accepts beliefs, need not form a means-end argument or\nexplicitly deliberate concurrently, but her awareness of her beliefs\nand actions as justified differs from that of the passively accepting\nagent.\n\nReasons of this kind dispose the agent to expect certain features in\ncertain kinds of situations, to pick out what is salient in those\nsituations, to have certain kinds of attitudes toward them, and to act\nin typical ways. In the manner of Aristotle\u2019s brave soldier\n(Nicomachean Ethics 1117a17\u201322), the agent just\nrecognizes the situation and knows what to do without further ado.\nHence, the claim that an action is considered less meritorious when\ndone without occurrent deliberation is false. Prior\nreflection and evaluation yield the sense of a specific\naction\u2014that is, a certain kind of action\u2014as\nappropriate for the particular circumstances in which an agent finds\nherself. It is the perceptual and emotional grasp of those\ncircumstances that further determines the agent\u2019s choice to\nfollow a particular course of action to achieve her\n ends.[18]\n\nThe phenomenology of moral deliberation has also been a basis for\narguing against certain metaethical views including non-cognitivism\nand in favor of a realist moral metaphysics. For example, Jonathan\nDancy writes:\n\n\nIn moral choice we struggle to find, not any answer that we can bring\nourselves to accept, nor any answer that we can accept in consistency\nwith previous answers, but the right answer. We present our search to\nourselves as one governed by a criterion which does not lie in\nourselves; our fear is that we may make the wrong choice, a fear not\nallayed by the thought that we might make that choice quite happily\nand/or consistently with previous choices. Why otherwise should moral\nchoice be so dodgy? Why otherwise should I agonize about what is the\nright thing to do in the circumstances? Non-cognitivism leaves moral\nlife too easy, and is inconsistent with the phenomenology. It distorts\nour sense of the authority that the action which we choose as right\nhas over us. That authority is one to which our choice must conform,\nand cannot itself depend on our choice; our choice is a recognition of\nan authority which it could not itself create. (Dancy 1986:\n172\u2013173; see also Nagel 1986: 149 and Enoch 2011: 73\u201375\nfor a similar argument)\n\n\nViews that attribute realist purport to the phenomenal character of\nmoral deliberation as well as to moral emotion, and moral judgment on\nthe basis of introspection alone are challenged by Horgan and Timmons\n(2008b, 2019)\n2.5 Moral agency\n\nOne Phenomenological view of the nature of moral agency derives from\nHusserl (1908\u20139/1911/1914 [1988: 107]) who calls the (implicit\nor explicit) volitional intention that initiates and governs an action\nthe fiat, the \u201clet it be done\u201d. The transition\nfrom the evaluation of the envisioned end as (apparently) good to the\nfiat is mediated by desire. The envisioned good disclosed by\nthe feeling or emotional apprehension is taken as desirable, and the\nfiat directs the agent to that desirable good as something to\nbe realized through a bodily performance. The fiat, in other\nwords, intends the envisioned good as realizable and is inseparable\nfrom the action that realizes (or attempts to realize) it (Melle 1997:\n180). At every moment of the action the volitional intention maintains\nitself both as a partially unfulfilled intention that is at the same\ntime partially fulfilled (Melle 1997: 181), and the action ordered\ntoward the satisfaction of the desire continues just so long as the\nfiat is operative.\n\nWilling is founded on and inseparable from desire, but it is not\nreducible to desire. Desiring is not willing insofar as it is not\nconstrained by practical modalities (e.g., possibility versus\nimpossibility) and it is not a determination to undertake an action. I\ncan wish for the impossible or for what is past (or both, as in\n\u201cI wish I did not have that second piece of pie at dinner last\nnight\u201d), and I can desire some future good but not wish to do\nwhat is required to obtain that good. Moreover, once one chooses to do\nA, and nothing interferes, one does A. We do not\nresist performing an action once we have willed it, but we do\nregularly resist some desires (Husserl 1908\u20139/1911/1914 [1988:\n103, 221\u2013224]; Melle 1997: 179; see also Bratman 2012: 73). The\nwishing that is relevant for the will and for action is a wishing for\nwhat is practically possible, what is realizable in action. This\nwishing takes the form of desire, and the volitional\nintention\u2014the fiat\u2014determines us to act.\n\nThe progressive completion of a volitional intention that initiates\nand controls a physical performance aimed at a desired end is a\nvoluntary action. On Ricoeur\u2019s view, the decision indicates a\npresent or future voluntary action which depends on me and which is\nwithin my power. But, as seen above, Ricoeur\u2019s position adopts a\nmeans-end conception of deliberation and action, and this masks an\nimportant distinction introduced by Husserl between two kinds of\nvolition, namely, the distinction between action-will\n[Handlungswille] and decision-will\n[Entschlu\u00dfwille]. Actions executing an action-will are\ninitiated by a desire for an end that is not explicitly\nintended in the willing. They involve no prior choice and manifest\nthemselves in the very performance of the\n action.[19]\n We shall call these voluntary actions. Actions executing a\ndecision-will, that is a prior choice or intention, are initiated by a\nchoice in the light of an end that is explicitly intended in\nthe\n willing.[20]\n We shall call these chosen actions. Chosen actions differ from\nvoluntary actions, then, in that they not only aim at a\ndesired end but are explicitly undertaken in the light of\nthat end. I might eat a chocolate sundae because, as a matter of\ndesire, I like sundaes, but I might choose to snack on a piece of\nfruit (rather than the sundae) for the sake of my health.\nEating the fruit is chosen as conducive to the end\n(Sokolowski 1985: 11; Drummond 2020a). In chosen action the agent\nwills that the action be done as conducing to an articulated\nend, whereas in merely voluntary action the agent wills that the\nobject of desire be realized by acting. While the outcome of\na merely voluntary action aiming at a particular end and that of a\nchosen action aiming at the same end might be the same, the\nintentional structures of the two volitional experiences and the\nactions undertaken to fulfill them differ.\n\nAlthough the early Husserl inherited an idealized utilitarianism from\nFranz Brentano, later in his career he favored a view that\n\u201cabsolute loves\u201d generate \u201cabsolute oughts\u201d\n(Husserl 1919\u201320 [2012: 146]; 1916\u201335 [2014:\n391\u2013392]). For example, a mother\u2019s love for her child\ndemands that she protect her child from harm even when sacrificing her\nchild is a lesser good for the aggregate and even when saving her\nchild leads to harm for others. The central idea is that an objective\nvalue can become an \u201cindividual, subjective value of\nlove\u201d, i.e., that \u201cthe same value can be infinitely more\n\u2018significant\u2019 for one person than another\u201d (Husserl\n1919\u201320 [2012: 146n.]). Such absolute loves\u2014we can also\nthink of them as commitments\u2014unconditionally bind that subject\nto honor those commitments regardless of what any purely objective,\nconsequentialist calculation might require (Husserl 1916\u201335\n[2014: 391\u2013392]). These commitments motivate an agent to adopt\nan ethical life-project and to undertake the actions necessary to\nrealize that project, a project that is \u201cthe deepest ground of\n[her] personal identity and individuality\u201d (Melle 1991: 131;\n2002:\n 243\u2013244).[21]\n This view is consistent with and an extension of \u201cweak\u201d\nvalue-realism. The \u201cabsoluteness\u201d of the imperative is\nrelative to the committed subject; the imperative, in Kantian terms,\nis a hypothetical imperative binding only on those who satisfy the\ncondition of being so committed (Drummond 2018b: 141\u201342).\n\nWhat we have called \u201cstrong\u201d value realism, by contrast,\npoints to universal imperatives tied, for example, to the hierarchy of\nvalues mentioned above: sensuous values; vital values; spiritual\nvalues; and the values of the holy and unholy. This list notably\nincludes no moral values. Scheler distinguishes between the purely\nideal ought-to-be (the value) and the moral ought-to-do (Scheler\n1913/1916 [1973: 203ff.], cf. Blosser 1987). Moral values, then,\nattach to actions that realize the values named in the hierarchy.\nHartmann is committed to a similar view regarding imperatives. Ideal\nvalues are experienced as demands, and the gravity of the violation of\na demand and the merit derived from fulfilling a demand are measured\nby the value\u2019s strength and height. Hartmann acknowledges,\nhowever, that these categorical demands are problematic. Personal and\nuniversal values conflict in ways that can never be fully resolved. To\ndo what everyone should do in the same circumstances is, in effect, to\nsay an agent is replaceable by anyone, and this, for Hartmann, is to\ndeny the agent\u2019s individuality as a person (1926 [1963: 357]).\nAppeals to universal principles depend upon a typicality among the\nsituations in which we are called upon to act, but any maxim of action\nmust be tied to a particular situation and to a particular agent in\nthat situation. Hence, on Hartmann\u2019s view, the universality of a\nprinciple undercuts its applicability to a particular situation that,\nowing to the uniqueness of persons and their interests and\ncommitments, is itself unique (Hartmann 1926 [1963: 358\u2013360]).\nUniversal principles, in a paradoxical way, just insofar as they fail\nto heed the individual personalities of agents, do not, and cannot,\noffer moral guidance. This conclusion pushes back in the direction of\nthe Husserlian position on axiological approaches to the phenomenology\nof action.\n\nNot all Phenomenologists adopt the axiological approach to moral\ntheory. Heidegger (1927 [2010: 97]), for example, was dismissive of\nthen-prevalent theories of value, and he turns instead to freedom and\n\u201cauthenticity\u201d to characterize ethical subjectivity. By\n\u201cauthenticity\u201d, he means a subject\u2019s taking\nresponsibility for and ownership over the choices she makes that give\nmeaning and value to her life. She thereby lifts herself out of the\nmoral complacency that characterizes agents who passively accept\ntraditional and cultural conceptions of what \u201cone\u201d does\n(Loidolt 2018: 703\u2013704). It is disputed whether Heidegger thus\ncommits himself to a \u201cdecisionism\u201d\u2014that is, the view\nthat a subject chooses who she will be without recourse to reasons or\nevaluative standards (cf., e.g., Tugendhat 1979, Okrent 1999)\u2014or\na \u201cdeep deliberation\u201d\u2014the view that the subject\nchooses who she will be in a critical reflection on her own identity\n(see Crowell 2007, 2013; Burch 2010).\n\nIf Heidegger is read in the direction of decisionism, however, he\nforeshadows those Phenomenologists who offer a constructivist account\nof value centered on the notion of freedom (e.g., Sartre 1943,\nBeauvoir 1947, and Merleau-Ponty 1945; also see the entry on\nconstructivism in metaethics). They believe that values are created\n(\u201cconstituted\u201d or \u201cconstructed\u201d) in the\nexercise of human freedom. The Phenomenologists who take a\nconstructivist approach to value and who claim that values are created\nin the exercise of human freedom adopt somewhat differing accounts of\nfreedom. The most radical view (e.g., Sartre 1943) claims that the\nexercise of the freedom definitive of human beings constitutes the\nreality of values in consciously and actively transcending the\nagent\u2019s situation, and that this exercise lacks transcendent\nvalues to justify it. Freedom, although itself unconstrained,\nnevertheless in its exercise, encounters factical obstacles, including\nmost importantly the presence of other autonomous agents. A weaker\nversion (e.g., Beauvoir 1947) also places freedom and transcendence at\nthe center of her ethical life while recognizing the obstacles freedom\nfaces. The goal at which freedom aims \u201cis not fixed once and for\nall\u201d but rather \u201cis defined all along the road which leads\nto it\u201d (Beauvoir 1947 [1948: 153]). For Beauvoir, this\nfundamental ambiguity characterizes human existence. Against the\nstronger view, however, Beauvoir believes that the other\u2019s\nfreedom cannot be viewed simply as an obstacle to one\u2019s own\nexercise of freedom. Rather, one\u2019s own freedom and the\nrealization of one\u2019s projects requires the cooperative freedom\nof others.\n\nA third constructivist alternative (see Merleau-Ponty 1945) frames the\nideas of freedom, transcendence, and ambiguity as analogous to\nartistic expression. Freedom seeks to create value within the\nlimitations of a given situation. On this view, the significance and\nvalue of things is not constituted in the free choices of agents, even\nwhen unconscious and non-deliberated; instead persons are born into a\nworld already permeated with meaning, and freedom is exercised in this\ncontext. Moral agents take the world as a task to be completed, a task\nof instituting meaning and value wherever and whenever possible\nthrough action. To create value consists in actively taking up our\nsituations of chance, making something out of contingency,\nestablishing communicative relationships, and creating and recreating\nvalues by actively changing the world.\n\nYet other Phenomenologists adopt a deontic viewpoint and challenge the\naxiological and constructivist approaches on the ground that values\nare often experienced as prescriptions, norms, imperatives,\nobligations, demands, and requirements. Since values are experienced\nin relation to feelings and emotions, the objection goes, it would\nseem that we are always free to value and choose otherwise, precisely\nbecause our feelings, interests, and choices can vary. Because of\nthat, it is difficult to understand in what sense the values we\nencounter can be thought to impose unconditional obligations.\n\nOne response would be to ascribe a strict necessity and universality\nto at least some moral values such that anyone recognizing those\nvalues would recognize the duty to realize the value in action.\nScheler (1913/1916 [1973: 203ff.]), for example, claims that insight\ninto the purely ideal ought-to-be (the value) serves as the basis for\nwilling and realizing the moral ought-to-do. But there is no clear\naccount in Scheler of the transition from the insight into ideal\nvalue-possibilities to the experience of moral imperatives, and it is\nnot clear that the experience of obligation would arise were one not\nto recognize the value. Von Hildebrand, by contrast, thinking that\nScheler\u2019s view entails that the spontaneous love of value\nmotivates action only hypothetically, insists that moral obligation\nhas categorical force. The \u201cimportance\u201d\n(Bedeutsamkeit) of an object enables it to awaken a\nperson\u2019s interest or motivate her action. Value is the kind of\nimportance that a thing has in itself (von Hildebrand 1916), and von\nHildebrand isolates a group of values that are good per se\napart from any relation to a subject\u2019s interests, needs, and\nwants. In making this move, however, if he gains a ground of\nobligation, he does so at the expense of divorcing these values and\ntheir attendant demands on us from their importance to the\nagent and thereby their character as motivating the subject to\nact.\n\nSimilarly, the deontic Phenomenologists argue that, since the\nconstructivist believes that values are created in the exercise of\nhuman autonomy, it is difficult to understand how an agent\u2019s\nchoices, while self-binding (at least for the moment), can legislate\nuniversal obligations that an agent would experience as a duty.\nLacking the view of practical reason found, for example, in Kant,\nconstructivism cannot underwrite moral normativity, in particular, the\nexperience of universal obligation.\n\nThe deontic Phenomenologists seek to ground the notion of obligation\nindependently of any notion of value or volition. On their view, the\nexperience of obligation is prior to all acts of evaluation, all\nchoices, all projects, and all dictates of reason, and it reveals\nitself in the experience of other persons (the Other). The deontic\nview grounds ethics in intersubjectivity, adopting a\n\u201csecond-person perspective\u201d in which encountering the\n\u201cface\u201d of the Other is the ground of obligation (Levinas\n1961; 1974; L\u00f8gstrup 1956; cf. Darwall 2006; see the entry on\n Emmanuel Levinas).\n The subject encounters an ethical transcendence in\nencountering the face of the Other insofar as the face is expressive\n(Levinas 1961 [1969: 51])\u2014the \u201crevelation\u201d (1961\n[1969: 73]) or \u201cepiphany\u201d (1961 [1969: 194])\u2014of the\nOther. My original ethical access to the Other disrupts my\nsubjectivity; the Other \u201cspeaks\u201d to me and calls me out of\nmy subjectivity. The Other, in short, is encountered as a summons and\na command, and the only appropriate form of encountering the Other,\ntherefore, is to respond. Only to the extent that I acknowledge this\nsummons and command do I live in a world with the Other and thereby\nbecome a person\u2014a moral agent\u2014myself. The Other and I\nexist in an asymmetrical relation wherein the Other\u2019s ethical\nsuperiority outweighs my egoism, unsettles my conscious\nintentionality, and contests my freedom in such a way that I must\nrespond. On this view, moral agency begins with neither my feelings\nand their correlative values nor my (constructive) freedom, but with\nthe recognition that my freedom is arbitrarily limited by my\nresponsibility to the Other. The experience of the Other is thus from\nthe beginning an experience of obligation.\n3. Moral Phenomenology and Normative Ethics\n\nWhile metaethics addresses second-order questions about morality,\nnormative ethics addresses first-order ethical questions about what to\ndo and how to be and divides into applied ethics and ethical (or\nmoral) theory. The former, also referred to as \u201cpractical\nethics\u201d, addresses questions about specific ethical issues\n(e.g., abortion, capital punishment) and ethical issues that arise in\nthe professions (e.g., medical ethics, business ethics). Normative\nethical theory (ethical theory henceforth), by contrast, addresses\ngeneral questions about which types of actions are morally\nright or wrong and what kind of person is morally good and\nwhy. In this section, we focus primarily on the bearing of moral\nphenomenology on ethical theory, in particular theories of right\nconduct (obligation), organized around three \u201cformal\u201d\nissues: (1) deontology vs. consequentialism about the structure of\nethical theory, (2) monism vs. pluralism about the number of\nfundamental morally relevant factors that determine, e.g., whether an\naction is right or wrong (an action\u2019s deontic status), and (3)\natomism vs. holism about the significance of morally relevant\ndescriptive features in explaining the instantiation of normative or\nevaluative properties. We take these up in order, after which we\nconclude with some remarks about other normative ethical issues that\nhave received attention from moral phenomenologists.\n3.1 Deontology vs. consequentialism\n\nJohn Rawls describes normative ethical theory as\n\n\nthe study of substantive moral conceptions, that is, the study of how\nthe basic moral notions of the right, the good, and moral worth may be\narranged to form different moral structures. (1975: 286)\n\n\nEach of these basic notions corresponds to a branch of any complete\nethical theory: theory of right conduct (or obligation), theory of\nvalue, and theory of moral worth (or virtue). A common way to\ndistinguish different ethical theories by their structure is in terms\nof which of these three notions (and corresponding theories) is most\nbasic in relation to a theory of right conduct. Consequentialist\ntheories explain right conduct in terms of the value of consequences\nassociated with an action or with rules for action guidance; they\nrepresent value-based theories (see the entry on\n consequentialism).\n Deontological theories are united in rejecting consequentialism and,\nfor instance, appealing to respect for persons as a basis for\nexplaining right conduct (see the entry on\n deontology).\n Virtue ethical theories take considerations of virtue (e.g., the\nactivities of a virtuous agent) as a basis for explaining right\nconduct (see the entry on\n virtue ethics).\n Because virtue ethical theories of obligation have emerged relatively\nrecently, twentieth century debates in ethical theory were dominated\nby debates between consequentialists (sometimes referred to as\nteleological theories) and deontologists. How might phenomenological\ninquiry be brought to bear on the dispute between these two types of\ntheory?\n\nWe have already touched on such debates in the previous section\n(Brentano\u2019s teleological ideal utilitarianism opposed by\nLevinas\u2019s non-teleological ethics). Mandelbaum defended a type\nof deontological view, so-called perceptual intuitionism, according to\nwhich in both direct and removed moral judgments of obligation, the\nfocus of one\u2019s judgment is on the fittingness (or unfittingness)\nof the act in relation to the agent\u2019s circumstances, a relation\nthat one directly apprehends\u2014a kind of intellectual perception.\nAlthough perceptual intuitionism is a kind of deontological theory, in\narguing for this view on phenomenological grounds Mandelbaum attempted\nto \u201cresolve \u2026 the conflict between utilitarianism and\ndeontology\u201d (1955: 71). So, for instance, regarding direct moral\njudgments of obligation focused on promoting good consequences,\nMandelbaum argues that as with felt obligations to keep a promise, or\nexpress gratitude, whose grounds lie in one\u2019s past, a felt\nobligation to bring about some good state of affairs rests upon\none\u2019s apprehension that an action one can perform is felt to be\na fitting response to the envisioned state of affairs in question,\nindeed, that refraining from the action would be unfitting. He thus\nconcludes that there is no genuine phenomenological difference between\nfinding the ground of obligation in the envisioned end of action (its\nconsequences) and finding the ground of this same obligation in the\nfittingness of the action to one\u2019s situation. In this way, he\nclaims, one can reconcile the phenomenology associated with\nteleologically focused judgments of direct obligation with the\nphenomenology of direct judgments of obligation whose experienced\nground is the fittingness of the action to one\u2019s situation. What\nMandelbaum attempts to thereby show is that the phenomenology of\njudgments of obligation (both direct and removed) have a common\nphenomenological character properly captured in his favored perceptual\nintuitionism\u2014a form of deontology\u2014and thus on\nphenomenological grounds his form of deontology is to be preferred\nover versions of\n teleology.[22]\n\nThis is but one example of bringing phenomenological considerations to\nbear on ethical theory. We have dwelt on Mandelbaum because of the\ndepth and subtlety of his phenomenological analysis which he brings to\nbear on the issue of structure. However, increasingly, philosophers in\nthe analytic tradition have been more attentive to the relevance of\nphenomenological considerations in defending ethical theories. For\ninstance, T. M. Scanlon defends a \u201ccontractualist\u201d ethical\ntheory that he finds attractive partly because, \u201cthe account it\noffers of moral motivation is phenomenologically more accurate than\nany other I know of\u201d (1998: 187). Specifically, Scanlon argues\nthat his contractualism fits with one\u2019s experience of the\npriority and significance of moral reasons for action (compared to\nnonmoral reasons for action) and does so in a way superior to\ncompeting ethical theories.\n3.2 Monism vs. pluralism\n\nThis distinction cuts across the deontology/consequentialism/virtue\nethics distinctions. A monistic moral theory of right action takes\nthere to be a single right-making feature of actions, while pluralist\nviews take there to be more than one. According to one sort of\nhedonistic act utilitarian ethical theory, there is a single\nfundamental descriptive property\u2014an action\u2019s utility,\nunderstood as the net balance of pleasure versus pain it would bring\nabout\u2014that explains why some actions are wrong (they fail to\nmaximize utility) and others are not. This kind of monistic theory is\nopposed by such pluralist theories as Ross\u2019s ethics of prima\nfacie duty, according to which there is a multiplicity of\nbasic right (and wrong)-making features; Ross identified\nseven: fidelity, reparation, gratitude, justice, beneficence,\nself-improvement, and non-maleficence. How might considerations of\nmoral phenomenology be brought to bear on this dispute?\n\nOne sort of phenomenological argument appeals to the difference\nbetween experiences of regret and remorse. Assume (along with those\nwho marshal this argument) that it makes sense to regret finding\noneself in circumstances involving difficult moral choices, while it\nmakes sense to feel remorse about having acted wrongly. Suppose, then,\nthat in the past a co-worker had intervened to save your job from a\nvindictive administrator who unjustly wanted you fired for personal\nreasons not related to how well you did your job. Now, some years\nlater you both find yourselves in new positions. You are asked by a\nsupervisor your opinion of your co-worker\u2019s suitability for\ntheir current position and your honest opinion is that they are not\nsuitable. On Ross\u2019s ethical theory, both the prima\nfacie duty of gratitude and the prima facie duty of\nfidelity apply to this situation and one must choose which of them is\nmost stringent in these particular circumstances. Suppose you choose\nto answer truthfully about your colleague\u2019s job performance.\nBesides the regret you feel about finding yourself in this difficult\nsituation, on Ross\u2019s view, whichever choice you make, it is\nfitting for you to feel some remorse for not having complied with the\nprima facie duty of gratitude, which was in force when you\nmade your decision. By contrast, on a monist theory like hedonistic\nutilitarianism where the only right-making feature of actions is their\nutility, it is not fitting to feel remorse if being truthful in this\ncircumstance brings about a higher degree of utility than lying. In\nchoosing to truthfully express one\u2019s opinion, one does not leave\nundone a duty that was in force, even if overridden. Thus, on a\nmonistic view, the conflict is only apparent, while on a pluralist\nview it is genuine. The argument, then, is that a pluralist view\naccommodates people\u2019s experiences of remorse (not mere regret)\nin such circumstances, thus making sense of agonizing moral decisions\n(as Michael Gill 2012 labels such cases) as they are normally\nexperienced (see also McNaughton 1988: chap. 13).\n\nWhat Ross\u2019s theory takes for granted is that in any circumstance\nwhere one might do something out of gratitude (and similarly for all\nof the basic Rossian prima facie duties) the fact that the\nact would be an expression of gratitude is always relevant in\nassessing one\u2019s moral obligations, and always counts as a\nfavoring reason for expressing gratitude, even if in some\ncircumstances like the one just described, it is overridden. This\nreveals a commitment to what is called \u201creasons atomism\u201d\nwhich is opposed by holistic conceptions of reasons, our next\ntopic.\n3.3 Atomism vs. holism\n\nAccording to an atomistic view, then, some morally relevant reasons\nare invariant in their relevance and their valence. Opposed to this\nview are holists who claim that whether a consideration like pleasure\nis relevant and whether it counts in favor of an action depends on\nwhat other factors may be present in some set of circumstances.\nHolists claim that in some circumstances a factor that is normally\nrelevant is \u201csilenced\u201d and moreover even when relevant its\nvalence may be reversed! Although pleasure tends to have a positive\nvalence, the pleasure a bully would derive from bullying someone has a\nnegative valence, which contributes to the wrongness of the\nbully\u2019s act.\n\nMandelbaum used the example from the previous section (his example) to\nargue against Rossian atomism (although the atomism/holism terminology\nhad not yet been introduced as labels for the pertinent distinction).\nAs we explained, if Ross\u2019s atomistic view is correct, the fact\nthat one has a chance to express gratitude is a morally relevant\nconsideration that favors lying about your co-worker\u2019s\ncompetence. In not acting on this consideration, one ought to feel\nsome remorse (having failed to comply with a prima facie\nduty), remorse being a proper reaction to wrongness. However, if, upon\ncontemplating this scenario and projecting into it, one imagines\nexperiencing regret at being in this difficult situation, but not\nremorse, this signifies that one takes considerations of gratitude to\nbe irrelevant in deciding what to do in this case. Mandelbaum\nargues that \u201cthe essential aspect of the situation\u201d (1955:\n78) is that one has been asked a legitimate question, and the person\nasking it is either unaware of one\u2019s personal tie with the\nco-worker or expects one to put it aside in answering the question.\nViewed this way, considerations of gratitude are not relevant in the\nsituation one confronts. Mandelbaum further reports that he imagines\nfeeling regret at being in such a situation, but not remorse for\ntelling the truth.\n\nThus, while the experiential difference between regret, whose object\nis one\u2019s circumstances, and remorse, whose object is one\u2019s\naction (or omission), is used in defense of pluralism over monism\nregarding the fundamental right- and wrong-making features of actions,\nthis same contrast has been marshaled in defense of holism over\natomism about the relevance and valence of such features.\n3.4 Further issues\n\nTwo further issues in normative ethics that deserve mention, if only\nbriefly, are these.\n\nRegarding three of the most prominent types of ethical\ntheory\u2014consequentialism, deontology, and virtue\nethics\u2014phenomenological considerations specific to each can help\nilluminate them. Some versions of consequentialism hold that pleasure\nand pain have positive and negative value respectively that figure in\ndetermining the deontic status of actions. Since these experiences\narguably have a phenomenological element to them, one can expect\nphenomenological analysis to help explain the value they do have.\nTaking a Kantian view as a model of deontology with the emphasis on\nrespect for persons, the phenomenology of respect for persons will\nbear importantly in fully illuminating this kind of theory (see\nDrummond 2006, Kriegel 2018, Kriegel & Timmons 2021) And, we have\nalready noted work on the phenomenology of virtue (Annas 2008) that\ncan be brought to bear on virtue ethics. (These points are taken from\nKriegel 2019).\n\nMoreover, as touched upon above in\n section 2.2\n and\n section 2.5,\n Phenomenologists go beyond mere description of the feelings or\nemotions as apprehending value to bring their analyses to bear on\nnormative issues. While some, for example, Levinas, adopt a\nstraightforward deontic approach, others who adopt an axiological\napproach also address the normative. Recall that for Scheler the\nfeeling-apprehension of the ideal, a priori value motivates\n(in an unspecified manner) the awareness of a moral ought-to-do that\nwill instantiate the value. Hence, we can think of such thinkers as\ndeontologists. Others, however, who adopt a weaker version of value\nrealism move in the direction of virtue ethics and an aretaic, rather\nthan deontic, conception of \u201cright\u201d action.\nHusserl\u2019s notion of \u201cabsolute loves\u201d as generating\n\u201cabsolute oughts\u201d is a case in point. The mother\u2019s\nabsolute love generates an \u201cought\u201d in the sense that the\nmother feels she must do her \u201cbest\u201d for the child.\nIt\u2019s the right action insofar as it is the best action available\nrather than a deontic demand. Drummond (2006, 2010), while claiming\nthat respect imposes obligations upon an agent, nevertheless locates\nrespect within a eudaimonistic, virtue framework, and Irene McMullin\n(2019) develops an account of the virtues that incorporates\nfirst-person, second-person, and third-person perspectives.\n\nFinally, phenomenological evidence has been brought to bear on the\nvarious roles that morally relevant reasons for action might\nplay. Dwelling on the controversial category of the supererogatory,\nHorgan and Timmons (2010a) argue that making sense of the\nsupererogatory as it is normally experienced requires recognizing that\nin addition to such reasons playing requiring and justifying roles\n(Gert 2004), we must recognize what they call a\n\u201cmerit-conferring\u201d role for reasons\u2014reasons that\nmorally favor a course of action without prima facie\nrequiring it, let alone requiring it all-things-considered.\nConclusion\n\nThere has been a growing tendency on the part of philosophers to put\naside the distinction between \u201cContinental\u201d and analytic\nphilosophy and to focus on problems of common concern. This\ndevelopment is perhaps most evident in the philosophy of mind. See,\nfor example, Shaun Gallagher and Dan Zahavi\u2019s The\nPhenomenological Mind (2012), which situates Phenomenology in\nrelation to the analytic philosophy of mind and the cognitive\nsciences. Think, too, of the recent explosion in the study of the\nemotions. We have mentioned a number of moral phenomenologists who\nexplore the emotions, and their work involves dialogue with others\nworking on the emotions who do not explore their moral dimension.\nDrummond and Rinofner-Kreidl\u2019s (2018) collection on emotional\nexperiences, for example, has brought together Phenomenological and\nanalytic philosophers of mind. More important, if you look at the list\nof references in the separate articles, almost all of them cite\nauthors from multiple traditions. Conversely, analytic philosophers of\nmind are looking to Phenomenological thinkers and to new possibilities\nfor conceiving moral experience. The work outlined in this\ncontribution is an instance of these more inclusive approaches and\nsuggests an agenda for further research.\n",
