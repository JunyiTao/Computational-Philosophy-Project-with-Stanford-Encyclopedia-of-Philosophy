    "main_text": "The Correspondence Theory and Its Competitors || Deflationism About Truth\n8.4 Deflationism About Truth\n\n\nAt present the most noticeable competitors to correspondence theories\nare deflationary accounts of truth (or\n\u2018true\u2019). Deflationists maintain that correspondence\ntheories need to be deflated; that their central notions,\ncorrespondence and fact (and their relatives), play no legitimate role\nin an adequate account of truth and can be excised without loss. A\ncorrespondence-type formulation like\n(5) \u201cSnow is white\u201d is true iff it corresponds\nto the fact that snow is white,\n\n\nis to be deflated to\n(6) \u201cSnow is white\u201d is true iff snow is\nwhite,\n\n\nwhich, according to deflationists, says all there is to be said about\nthe truth of \u201cSnow is white\u201d, without superfluous\nembellishments (cf. Quine 1987, p. 213).\n\n\nCorrespondence theorists protest that (6) cannot lead to anything\ndeserving to be regarded as an account of truth. It is concerned with\nonly one particular sentence (\u201cSnow is white\u201d), and it\nresists generalization. (6) is a substitution instance of the\nschema\n(7) \u201cp\u201d is true iff\np,\n\n\nwhich does not actually say anything itself (it is not\ntruth-evaluable) and cannot be turned into a genuine generalization\nabout truth, because of its essential reliance on the schematic letter\n\u201cp\u201d, a mere placeholder. The attempt to turn (7) into a\ngeneralization produces nonsense along the lines of \u201cFor\nevery x, \u201cx\u201d is true\niff x\u201d, or requires invocation of truth: \u201cEvery\nsubstitution instance of the schema \u201c\u201cp\u201d is true iff\np\u201d is true\u201d. Moreover, no genuine generalizations\nabout truth can be accounted for on the basis of (7). Correspondence\ndefinitions, on the other hand, do yield genuine generalizations about\ntruth. Note that definitions like (1) and (2) in Section 3 employ\nordinary objectual variables (not mere schematic placeholders); the\ndefinitions are easily turned into genuine generalizations by\nprefixing the quantifier phrase \u201cFor every x\u201d,\nwhich is customarily omitted in formulations intended as\ndefinitions.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the deflationist\u2019s starting point, (5),\nwhich lends itself to deflating excisions, actually misrepresents the\ncorrespondence theory. According to (5), corresponding to the fact\nthat snow is white is sufficient and necessary for\n\u201cSnow is white\u201d to be true. Yet, according to (1) and (2),\nit is sufficient but not necessary: \u201cSnow is white\u201d will\nbe true as long as it corresponds to some fact or other. The genuine\narticle, (1) or (2), is not as easily deflated as the impostor\n(5).\n\n\nThe debate turns crucially on the question whether anything deserving\nto be called an \u201caccount\u201d or \u201ctheory\u201d of truth\nought to take the form of a genuine generalization (and ought to be\nable to account for genuine generalizations involving\ntruth). Correspondence theorists tend to regard this as a (minimal)\nrequirement. Deflationists argue that truth is a shallow (sometimes\n\u201clogical\u201d) notion\u2014a notion that has no serious\nexplanatory role to play: as such it does not require a full-fledged\naccount, a real theory, that would have to take the form of a genuine\ngeneralization.\n\n\nThere is now a substantial body of literature on truth-deflationism in\ngeneral and its relation to the correspondence theory in particular;\nthe following is a small selection: Quine 1970, 1987; Devitt 1984;\nField 1986; Horwich 1990 & 19982; Kirkham 1992; Gupta\n1993; David 1994, 2008; Schmitt 1995; K\u00fcnne 2003, chap. 4; Rami\n2009. Relevant essays are contained in Blackburn and Simmons 1999;\nSchantz 2002; Armour-Garb and Beall 2005; and Wright and Pedersen\n2010.
