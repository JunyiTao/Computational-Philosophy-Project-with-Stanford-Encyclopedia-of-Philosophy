    "main_text": "Comparison with Frege and Russell || Comparison with Russell\n3.2 Comparison with Russell\n\nRussell\u2019s analysis of identity sentences in Principles\n\u00a764 falls out of his theory of denoting concepts\u2014concepts\nthat, like intensions, determine an extension. In this section Russell\nshows how the theory of denoting concepts can explain \u201cwhy it is\never worthwhile to affirm identity\u201d:\n\nBut the question arises: Why is it ever worth while to affirm\nidentity? The question is answered by the theory of denoting. If we\nsay \u201cEdward VII is the King,\u201d we assert an identity; the\nreason why this assertion is worth making is, that in the one case the\nactual term occurs, while in the other a denoting concept takes its\nplace\u2026 Often two denoting concepts occur, and the term itself\nis not mentioned, as in the proposition \u201cthe present Pope is the\nlast survivor of his generation.\u201d When a term is given, the\nassertion of an identity with itself, though true, is perfectly\nfutile, and is never made outside the logic-books; but where denoting\nconcepts are introduced, identity is at once seen to be significant.\nIn this case, of course, there is involved, though not asserted, a\nrelation of the denoting concept to the terms, or of the two denoting\nconcepts to each other. But the is which occurs in such\npropositions does not itself state this further relation, but states\npure identity. (Russell 1903; note omitted)\n\n\nThis bears a striking similarity to Jones\u2019s proposal. When an\nidentity statement relates two \u201cterms\u201d, or individuals, it\nis trivial and \u201cis never made outside the logic-books\u201d;\nbut when at least one denoting concept is involved, the statement is\nsignificant. While these cases \u201cinvolve\u201d a relation of\nco-reference between the denoting concepts, or between one denoting\nconcept and the term denoted, this relation is not part of what is\nstated: the one relation stated remains \u201cpure identity\u201d.\nThus, even in the case of an identity statement involving a denoting\nconcept, such as \u2018the present Pope is the last survivor of his\ngeneration,\u2019 we nonetheless assert an identity involving the\nindividual determined by the denoting concept.\n\nIn \u201cThe Existential Import of Propositions\u201d (Russell\n1905a), the theory of denoting concepts is applied to the problem of\nvacuous singular terms. Russell explains how the failure of a singular\nterm to denote is compatible with the term\u2019s nonetheless having\nmeaning, if we assume that denoting phrases (such as \u2018the\npresent King of France\u2019) and at least certain names\n(\u2018Apollo\u2019) express denoting concepts. Jones seems not to\nhave considered the application of her denotation-connotation\ndistinction to the problem of vacuous terms and does not appeal to its\nutility in this connection in arguing for her proposal.\n",
