    "main_text": "Diagrams as Representational Systems || Peirce\u2019s extension\n2.3 Peirce\u2019s extension\n\nPeirce points out that Venn\u2019s system has no way of representing\nthe following kinds of information: existential statements,\ndisjunctive information, probabilities, and relations. Peirce aimed to\nextend Venn\u2019s system in expressive power with respect to the\nfirst two kinds of propositions, i.e., existential and disjunctive\nstatements. This extension was completed by means of the following\nthree devices. (i) Replace Venn\u2019s shading representing emptiness\nwith a new symbol, \u2018o\u2019. (ii) Introduce a symbol\n\u2018x\u2019 for existential import. (iii) For disjunctive\ninformation, introduce a linear symbol \u2018-\u2019 which connects\n\u2018o\u2019 and \u2018x\u2019 symbols.\n\nFor example, Figure 4 represents the statement, \u2018All A\nare B or some A is B\u2019, which neither\nEuler\u2019s nor Venn\u2019s system can represent in a single\ndiagram.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A Peirce diagram\n\n\nThe reason that Peirce replaced Venn\u2019s shading for emptiness\nwith the symbol \u2018o\u2019 seems to be obvious: It would not be\neasy to connect shadings or shadings and \u2018x\u2019s in order to\nrepresent disjunctive information. In this way, Peirce increased the\nexpressive power of the system, but this change was not without its\ncosts.\n\nFor example, the following diagram represents the proposition\n\u2018Either all A are B and some\nA is B, or no A is B and\nsome B is not A\u2019:\n\n\n\n\n\nReading off this diagram requires more than reading off visual\ncontainment among circles (as in Euler diagrams) or shadings (as in\nVenn diagrams), but also requires extra conventions for reading\ncombinations of the symbols \u2018o,\u2019 \u2018x,\u2019 and\nlines. Peirce\u2019s new conventions increased the expressive power\nof single diagrams, but the arbitrariness of its conventions and more\nconfusing representations (for example, the above diagram) sacrificed\nthe visual clarity which Euler\u2019s original system enjoys. At this\npoint, Peirce himself confesses that \u2018there is a great\ncomplexity in the expression that is essential to the meaning\u2019\n(Peirce\n 1933:\n 4.365). Thus, when Peirce\u2019s revision was completed, most of\nEuler\u2019s original ideas about visualization were lost, except\nthat a geometrical object (the circle) is used to represent (possibly\nempty) sets.\n\nAnother important contribution Peirce made to the study of diagrams\nstarts with the following remark:\n\n\u2018Rule\u2019 is here used in the sense in which we speak of the\n\u2018rules\u2019 of algebra; that is, as a permission under\nstrictly defined conditions. (Peirce\n 1933:\n 4.361)\n\n\nPeirce was probably the first person to discuss rules of\ntransformation in a non-sentential representation system. In the same\nway that the rules of algebra tell us which transformations of symbols\nare permitted and which are not, so should the rules of diagram\nmanipulation. Some of Pierce\u2019s six rules needed more\nclarification and turn out to be incomplete\u2014a problem which\nPeirce himself anticipated. However, more importantly, Peirce did not\nhave any theoretical tool\u2014a clear distinction between syntax and\nsemantics\u2014to convince the reader that each rule is correct or to\ndetermine whether more rules are needed. That is, his important\nintuition (that there could be transformation rules for diagrams)\nremained to be justified.\n",
