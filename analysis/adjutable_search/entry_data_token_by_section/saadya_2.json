    "main_text": "Tradition, Revelation and Prophecy\n3. Tradition, Revelation and Prophecy\n\n Tradition for Saadya demarcates a unique category of knowing, in\nthat, unlike the 3 other epistemological processes he addresses\n(viz. sensory, inferential and reason-based knowing), knowing by\ntradition comes to a person (or a group) all at once (as opposed to\nbeing a process unfolding in time, as is the case for the other 3\nmodes of knowing).  Furthermore, knowledge received from tradition is\nnot only immediately received, but is additionally\nimmediately certain to its\nrecipient(s). \u201ctradition\u201d translates Saadya's Arabic\n\u201cal-kabar\u201d (Ibn Tibbon's Hebrew: haggadah),\nwhich literally has the sense of \u201ca report.\u201d The\nconceptual heart of tradition can hence be understood as a kind of\nreliable report \u2014 or heard testimony transmitted from\nperson to person. It might further be noted that tradition\n(al-kabar) has its root in the Arabic verb kabara,\n\u201cto experience,\u201d with the additional sense of \u201cto\nknow,\u201d and even \u201cto know thoroughly.\u201d As such,\nSaadya's Arabic notion of tradition-as-report carries with it already\na suggestion of reliable knowledge.\n\n Here, explicitly identifying Scripture as tradition (though\nelsewhere, he speaks of rabbinic writings as tradition too), he\nexplains:\n\n [God] knew that His laws and the stories of His wondrous signs would,\nthrough the passage of time, require people to hand them down to\nposterity, so that they might become as evident to later generations\nas they were to the earlier ones. Therefore, He prepared in our minds\na place for the acceptance of reliable tradition (al-kabar\nas-s\u00e2diq) and in our souls a quiet corner for trusting it so\nthat His Scriptures and stories should remain safely with us (Altmann,\n109)\n \n\n Reliable tradition, hence, is the report that one can trust. It is an\nimmediate source for certain knowledge.\n\n While in his discussions of tradition, Saadya uses the word\n\u2018kabar\u2019 which we have already seen to carry with it\nthe sense of reporting (but also, knowing), on this issue of\ntradition-as-report it is useful also to consider another Arabic root,\nsami\u2018a (to hear). While in and of itself, this root\nsimply means \u2018to hear,\u2019 it is, we might note, conceptually\nlinked to the notion of \u2018report\u2019 in the simple sense that\nreceiving a report most often involves hearing. And so, there is, in\nthe Arabic, a conceptual link between \u2018to hear\u2019 and\nSaadya's notion of tradition (kabar, as a\n\u201creport\u201d). In fact, the Arabic root \u2018to hear\u2019\nappears in one of its constructed forms\n(sam\u00e2\u2018\u00ee) with the literal straightforward\nmeaning of \u2018traditional\u2019, or \u2018derived from\ntradition\u2019. This link, then, between the notions of hearing and\ntradition in Saadya's Arabic linguistic and conceptual space is\nimportant to helping us properly \u2018recover\u2019 the essence of\nSaadya's notion of \u201crevelation.\u201d Contrary to the\nLatin-rooted \u201crevelation,\u201d which literally means,\n\u201crecovering\u201d (from Latin v\u00ea\u00f4, to cover,\nand hence \u201cto reveal\u201d literally as \u201cto\nrecover\u201d), the Arabic term which gets translated as\n\u201crevelation\u201d in Saadya's work is grounded in the Arabic\nroot \u201cto hear.\u201d Consider in particular Saadya's important\ndiscussion of a class of Biblical precepts, often translated as\n\u201claws of revelation.\u201d Following on a distinction already\ndrawn in rabbinic sources, but providing the first extended discussion\nof this distinction in a Jewish philosophical text, Saadya draws our\nattention to the presence of 2 classes of laws in the Hebrew\nscriptures, most frequently translated as the \u201claws of\nreason\u201d and the \u201claws of revelation.\u201d For the\n\u201claws of reason,\u201d Saadya uses the word\n\u2018aqliyy\u00e2t, from the word \u2018aql\n(lit. the faculty of intellect), and hence, we might say, these laws\nare \u2018the ones that are (or, can\u00a0 be) known by human\nintellect,\u2019 or \u2018the ones that are (or, at least can in\ntheory be) arrived at through human reason\u2019. As for the\n\u201claws of revelation,\u201d Saadya here employs the word\nsam\u2018iyy\u00e2t, from the root sami\u2018a,\n\u2018to hear\u2019; hence these laws are literally \u2018the ones\nthat are heard\u2019. The point, then, is to be aware that the Arabic\nroot of the word translated as \u201crevelation\u201d in the\ndistinction between \u201claws of reason\u201d and \u201claws of\nrevelation\u201d is a word that linguistically carries on its sleeve\nthe notion of \u201cbeing heard\u201d and, as such, carries with it\na more immediate correlation with the very concept of tradition (as\nthe [heard] report) than does the Latin-rooted term\n\u201crevelation.\u201d \n\n Appreciating the link \u2014 through the conceptual chain of\nreporting and hearing \u2014 between tradition and\nrevelation in Saadya is important for many reasons. First, it is\nimportant in and of itself, reminding us that translation can often\nmake us miss the conceptual overtones of the tradition we are trying\nto recover. Secondly, this link speaks directly to Saadya's own\ncommitment to the rabbinic tradition in Judaism as itself just as\nimportant as \u2014 and on equal epistemological footing with \u2014\nthe revealed scripture (contrary to the Karaite movement in Judaism\nwhich during Saadya's time was especially vociferous in flatly denying\nany binding authority to rabbinic law, and against whose ideas Saadya\ncomposed polemical responses). In other words, coming to appreciate\nthe conceptual link in Arabic between the idea of revelation and that\nof tradition (as we have shown above) might certainly be useful in\nhelping us better appreciate Saadya's own treatment of the rabbinic\ntradition (or, oral law) as divinely revealed. Furthermore, coming to\nappreciate this \u2018link-in-hearing\u2019 between\nrevelation and tradition additionally helps to elucidate the direct\nlink in Saadya between these two concepts, and prophecy. For Saadya,\nprophecy is, in part, a divinely \u201ccreated word\u201d\nheard by the prophet. On this picture, it is obvious \u2014\nsimply from the conceptual space of the Arabic terms \u2014 that,\nthrough this idea of hearing, revelation, tradition and\nprophecy are all intimately related. Although his notion of prophecy\nalso includes a visual element, the \u201ccreated glory\u201d\n(though it is interesting to note that for Saadya, the ultimate\nprophetic experience of Moses was only auditory and did not\ninclude this visual element), it is nonetheless important to stress\nthe immediate connection between notions of divine speaking, and human\nreception-as-hearing, itself with overtones for both revelation\nand tradition as the joint repositories of \u2018the things that are\n[reliably] heard\u2019 (and hence, known).\n\n In addition, then, to this \u201ccreated word\u201d auditory\nphenomenon revealed to the prophet, Saadya's doctrine of prophecy also\ninvolves the \u201ccreated glory\u201d, a kind of visual element of\nthe prophecy, described in particular by Saadya as the verification\nmechanism for the prophet.  It is in seeing the created glory that the\nprophet knows his prophetic encounter to be true (though, as mentioned\nabove, Saadya suggests that the prophecy of Moses lacked this visual\naspect, consisting in an encounter with created word alone). \n\n In Saadya's Commentary on the Book of Creation\n(Tafs\u00eer Kit\u00e2b al-Mab\u00e2d\u00ee), we learn more\nabout the created glory in Saadya's doctrine of a\n\u201c2nd air.\u201d There, created glory, or the\n\u201c2nd air,\u201d is described as a prophetic\nintermediary of some sort between God and man. \n\n The prophetic air in question is described by Saadya as\n\u201csecond\u201d precisely in the sense that it is anterior to, as\nwell as subtler and more powerful than, regular elemental air (which\nhe calls \u201cmanifest air\u201d). In other words, from the human\nvantage point, regular breathable air is \u201cfirst\u201d, and\n\u201cprophetic air\u201d is \u201csecond.\u201d If we take this\nin some spatial sense, the idea would seem to be that this\n2nd more subtle, refined variety of air lies midway\nbetween the regular human realm and the divine realm. This reading\nwould suggest that created glory is not only a source for prophecy,\nbut is, at least prima facie, a cosmic intermediary, playing an\nintermediating role in the prophetic encounter.  Futhermore, thus\nseeing the 2nd air as a \u2018cosmic intermediary\u2019\nmight seem to suggest that it is an hypostasized reality, a point\nwhich seems further supported by Saadya's own description of this\n2nd air as a \u2018shay makhl\u00fbq\u2019\n(\u2018a created thing\u2019). \n\n Along these lines, it might be noted that in an influential study of\nthe prophetic phenomenon in Saadya, Altmann sees Saadya's\ncommitment to created glory as a commitment in particular to some sort\nof an hypostasized entity; in fact, it is precisely on the basis of\nthis hypostasizing view that Altmann argues for distinguishing\nSaadya's theory of prophecy from the Mu\u2018t\u00e2zilite\n view.[2]\n All this said, though, the exact nature of the created glory in\nSaadya is somewhat ambiguous, and, as such, it seems at least\nplausible to deny that this element of Saadya's prophetic view is\nintended in a strictly reified sense. What is clear, in any case, is\nthat it is through his descriptions and analyses of created word and\ncreated glory that Saadya strives to unambiguously ground the\nlegitimacy and objectivity of prophecy, and hence, of tradition\nitself.\n",
