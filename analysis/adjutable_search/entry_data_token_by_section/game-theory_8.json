It can be raised with respect to any\nnumber of examples, but we will borrow an elegant one from C.\nBicchieri\n (1993).\n Consider the following game: \n\n\n\nFigure 11\n\n\nThe NE outcome here is at the single leftmost node descending from\nnode 8. To see this, backward induct again. At node 10, I would play L\nfor a payoff of 3, giving II a payoff of 1. II can do better than this\nby playing L at node 9, giving I a payoff of 0. I can do better than\nthis by playing L at node 8; so that is what I does, and the game\nterminates without II getting to move. A puzzle is then raised by\nBicchieri (along with other authors, including\n Binmore (1987)\n and\n Pettit and Sugden (1989))\n by way of the following reasoning. Player I plays L at node 8 because\nshe knows that Player II is economically rational, and so would, at\nnode 9, play L because Player II knows that Player I is economically\nrational and so would, at node 10, play L. But now we have the\nfollowing paradox: Player I must suppose that Player II, at node 9,\nwould predict Player I\u2019s economically rational play at node 10\ndespite having arrived at a node (9) that could only be reached if\nPlayer I is not economically rational! If Player I is not economically\nrational then Player II is not justified in predicting that Player I\nwill not play R at node 10, in which case it is not clear that Player\nII shouldn\u2019t play R at 9; and if Player II plays R at 9, then\nPlayer I is guaranteed of a better payoff then she gets if she plays L\nat node 8. Both players use backward induction to solve the game;\nbackward induction requires that Player I know that Player II knows\nthat Player I is economically rational; but Player II can solve the\ngame only by using a backward induction argument that takes as a\npremise the failure of Player I to behave in accordance with economic\nrationality. This is the paradox of backward induction.\n\nA standard way around this paradox in the literature is to invoke the\nso-called \u2018trembling hand\u2019 due to\n Selten (1975).\n The idea here is that a decision and its consequent act may\n\u2018come apart\u2019 with some nonzero probability, however small.\nThat is, a player might intend to take an action but then slip up in\nthe execution and send the game down some other path instead. If there\nis even a remote possibility that a player may make a\nmistake\u2014that her \u2018hand may tremble\u2019\u2014then no\ncontradiction is introduced by a player\u2019s using a backward\ninduction argument that requires the hypothetical assumption that\nanother player has taken a path that an economically rational player\ncould not choose. In our example, Player II could reason about what to\ndo at node 9 conditional on the assumption that Player I chose L at\nnode 8 but then slipped.\n\nGintis (2009a)\n points out that the apparent paradox does not arise merely from our\nsupposing that both players are economically rational. It rests\ncrucially on the additional premise that each player must know, and\nreasons on the basis of knowing, that the other player is economically\nrational. This is the premise with which each player\u2019s\nconjectures about what would happen off the equilibrium path of play\nare inconsistent. A player has reason to consider out-of-equilibrium\npossibilities if she either believes that her opponent is economically\nrational but his hand may tremble or she attaches some\nnonzero probability to the possibility that he is not economically\nrational or she attaches some doubt to her conjecture about\nhis utility function. As Gintis also stresses, this issue with solving\nextensive-form games games for SEP by Zermelo\u2019s algorithm\ngeneralizes: a player has no reason to play even a Nash\nequilibrium strategy unless she expects other players to also play\nNash equilibrium strategies. We will return to this issue in\n Section 7\n below.\n\nThe paradox of backward induction, like the puzzles raised by\nequilibrium refinement, is mainly a problem for those who view game\ntheory as contributing to a normative theory of rationality\n(specifically, as contributing to that larger theory the theory of\nstrategic rationality). The non-psychological game theorist\ncan give a different sort of account of apparently\n\u201cirrational\u201d play and the prudence it encourages. This\ninvolves appeal to the empirical fact that actual agents, including\npeople, must learn the equilibrium strategies of games they\nplay, at least whenever the games are at all complicated. Research\nshows that even a game as simple as the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nrequires learning by people\n (Ledyard 1995,\n Sally 1995,\n Camerer 2003,\n p. 265). What it means to say that people must learn equilibrium\nstrategies is that we must be a bit more sophisticated than was\nindicated earlier in constructing utility functions from behavior in\napplication of Revealed Preference Theory. Instead of constructing\nutility functions on the basis of single episodes, we must do so on\nthe basis of observed runs of behavior once it has\nstabilized, signifying maturity of learning for the subjects in\nquestion and the game in question. Once again, the Prisoner\u2019s\nDilemma makes a good example. People encounter few one-shot\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemmas in everyday life, but they encounter many\nrepeated PD\u2019s with non-strangers. As a result, when set\ninto what is intended to be a one-shot PD in the experimental\nlaboratory, people tend to initially play as if the game were a single\nround of a repeated PD. The repeated PD has many Nash equilibria that\ninvolve cooperation rather than defection. Thus experimental subjects\ntend to cooperate at first in these circumstances, but learn after\nsome number of rounds to defect. The experimenter cannot infer that\nshe has successfully induced a one-shot PD with her experimental setup\nuntil she sees this behavior stabilize.\n\nIf players of games realize that other players may need to learn game\nstructures and equilibria from experience, this gives them reason to\ntake account of what happens off the equilibrium paths of\nextensive-form games. Of course, if a player fears that other players\nhave not learned equilibrium, this may well remove her incentive to\nplay an equilibrium strategy herself. This raises a set of deep\nproblems about social learning\n (Fudenberg and Levine 1998).\n How can ignorant players learn to play equilibria if sophisticated\nplayers don\u2019t show them, because the sophisticated are not\nincentivized to play equilibrium strategies until the ignorant have\nlearned? The crucial answer in the case of applications of game theory\nto interactions among people is that young people are\nsocialized by growing up in networks of\ninstitutions, including cultural norms. Most complex\ngames that people play are already in progress among people who were\nsocialized before them\u2014that is, have learned game structures and\nequilibria\n (Ross 2008a).\n Novices must then only copy those whose play appears to be expected\nand understood by others. Institutions and norms are rich with\nreminders, including homilies and easily remembered rules of thumb, to\nhelp people remember what they are doing\n (Clark 1997).\n\nAs noted in\n Section 2.7\n above, when observed behavior does not stabilize around\nequilibria in a game, and there is no evidence that learning is still\nin process, the analyst should infer that she has incorrectly modeled\nthe situation she is studying. Chances are that she has either\nmis-specified players\u2019 utility functions, the strategies\navailable to the players, or the information that is available to\nthem. Given the complexity of many of the situations that social\nscientists study, we should not be surprised that mis-specification of\nmodels happens frequently. Applied game theorists must do lots of\nlearning, just like their subjects. \n\nThe paradox of backward induction is one of a family of paradoxes that\narise if one builds possession and use of literally complete\ninformation into a concept of rationality. (Consider, by analogy, the\nstock market paradox that arises if we suppose that economically\nrational investment incorporates literally rational expectations:\nassume that no individual investor can beat the market in the long run\nbecause the market always knows everything the investor knows; then no\none has incentive to gather knowledge about asset values; then no one\nwill ever gather any such information and so from the assumption that\nthe market knows everything it follows that the market cannot know\nanything!)As we will see in detail in various discussions below, most\napplications of game theory explicitly incorporate uncertainty and\nprospects for learning by players. The extensive-form games with SPE\nthat we looked at above are really conceptual tools to help us prepare\nconcepts for application to situations where complete and perfect\ninformation is unusual. We cannot avoid the paradox if we think, as\nsome philosophers and normative game theorists do, that one of the\nconceptual tools we want to use game theory to sharpen is a fully\ngeneral idea of rationality itself. But this is not a concern\nentertained by economists and other scientists who put game theory to\nuse in empirical modeling. In real cases, unless players have\nexperienced play at equilibrium with one another in the past, even if\nthey are all economically rational and all believe this about one\nanother, we should predict that they will attach some positive\nprobability to the conjecture that understanding of game structures\namong some players is imperfect. This then explains why people, even\nif they are economically rational agents, may often, or even usually,\nplay as if they believe in trembling hands.\n\nLearning of equilibria may take various forms for different agents and\nfor games of differing levels of complexity and risk. Incorporating it\ninto game-theoretic models of interactions thus introduces an\nextensive new set of technicalities. For the most fully developed\ngeneral theory, the reader is referred to\n Fudenberg and Levine (1998);\n the same authors provide a non-technical overview of the issues in\n Fudenberg and Levine (2016).\n A first important distinction is between learning specific parameters\nbetween rounds of a repeated game (see\n Section 4)\n with common players, and learning about general strategic\nexpectations across different games. The latter can include learning\nabout players if the learner is updating expectations based on her\nmodels of types of players she recurrently encounters. Then\nwe can distinguish between passive learning, in which a\nplayer merely updates her subjective priors based on her\nobservation of moves and outcomes, and strategic choices she infers\nfrom these, and active learning, in which she probes\u2014in\ntechnical language screens\u2014for information about other\nplayers\u2019 strategies by choosing strategies that test her\nconjectures about what will occur off what she believes to be the\ngame\u2019s equilibrium path. A major difficulty for both players and\nmodelers is that screening moves might be misinterpreted if players\nare also incentivized to make moves to signal information to\none another (see\n Section 4).\n In other words: trying to learn about strategies can under some\ncircumstances interfere with players\u2019 abilities to learn\nequilibria. Finally, the discussion so far has assumed that all\npossible learning in a game is about the structure of the game itself.\n Wilcox (2008)\n shows that if players are learning new information about causal\nprocesses occurring outside a game while simultaneously trying to\nupdate expectations about other players\u2019 strategies, the modeler\ncan find herself reaching beyond the current limits of technical\nknowledge.\n\nIt was said above that people might usually play as if they\nbelieve in trembling hands. A very general reason for this is that\nwhen people interact, the world does not furnish them with cue-cards\nadvising them about the structures of the games they\u2019re playing.\nThey must make and test conjectures about this from their social\ncontexts. Sometimes, contexts are fixed by institutional rules. For\nexample, when a person walks into a retail shop and sees a price tag\non something she\u2019d like to have, she knows without needing to\nconjecture or learn anything that she\u2019s involved in a simple\n\u2018take it or leave it\u2019 game. In other markets, she might\nknow she is expected to haggle, and know the rules for that too. \n\nGiven the unresolved complex relationship between learning theory and\ngame theory, the reasoning above might seem to imply that game theory\ncan never be applied to situations involving human players that are\nnovel for them. Fortunately, however, we face no such impasse. In a\npair of influential papers, McKelvey and Palfrey\n (1995,\n 1998) developed the solution concept of quantal response\nequilibrium (QRE). QRE is not a refinement of NE, in the sense of\nbeing a philosophically motivated effort to strengthen NE by reference\nto normative standards of rationality. It is, rather, a method for\ncalculating the equilibrium properties of choices made by players\nwhose conjectures about possible errors in the choices of other\nplayers are uncertain. QRE is thus standard equipment in the toolkit\nof experimental economists who seek to estimate the distribution of\nutility functions in populations of real people placed in situations\nmodeled as games. QRE would not have been practically serviceable in\nthis way before the development of econometrics packages such as Stata\n(TM) allowed computation of QRE given adequately powerful observation\nrecords from interestingly complex games. QRE is rarely utilized by\nbehavioral economists, and is almost never used by psychologists, in\nanalyzing laboratory data. In consequence, many studies by researchers\nof these types make dramatic rhetorical points by\n\u2018discovering\u2019 that real people often fail to converge on\nNE in experimental games. But NE, though it is a minimalist solution\nconcept in one sense because it abstracts away from much informational\nstructure, is simultaneously a demanding empirical expectation if it\nis imposed categorically (that is, if players are expected to play as\nif they are all certain that all others are playing NE strategies).\nPredicting play consistent with QRE is consistent with\u2014indeed,\nis motivated by\u2014the view that NE captures the core general\nconcept of a strategic equilibrium. One way of framing the\nphilosophical relationship between NE and QRE is as follows. NE\ndefines a logical principle that is well adapted for\ndisciplining thought and for conceiving new strategies for generic\nmodeling of new classes of social phenomena. For purposes of\nestimating real empirical data one needs to be able to define\nequilibrium statistically. QRE represents one way of doing\nthis, consistently with the logic of NE. The idea is sufficiently rich\nthat its depths remain an open domain of investigation by game\ntheorists. The current state of understanding of QRE is\ncomprehensively reviewed in\n Goeree, Holt and Palfrey (2016).\n\n",
