    "main_text": "Works\n2. Works\n\nWilliam\u2019s most important philosophical writings form part of a\nvast seven-part work he calls the Magisterium divinale et\nsapientiale, a title Teske translates as Teaching on God in\nthe Mode of Wisdom. The Magisterium is generally taken\nto consist of the following seven works in the order given:\n\nDe Trinitate, sive de primo principio (On the\nTrinity, or the First Principle)\nDe universo (On the Universe)\nDe anima (On the Soul)\nCur Deus homo (Why God Became Man)\nDe fide et legibus (On Faith and Laws)\nDe sacramentis (On the Sacraments)\nDe virtutibus et moribus (On Virtues and\nMorals).\n\n\nWilliam did not compose the parts of the Magisterium in their\nrational order, and appears to have developed his conception of its\nstructure as he wrote its various parts. He viewed it as having two\nprincipal parts. The first part is comprised of De Trinitate,\nDe universo, and De anima. In this, the most\nphilosophical part of the Magisterium, William proceeds by\n\u201cthe paths of proofs\u201d or philosophizing rather than by an\nappeal to the authority of revelation. He intends to combat a range of\nphilosophical errors incompatible, as he sees it, with the Christian\nfaith. In On the Trinity he develops his metaphysics,\nattacking, among others, errors regarding creation, divine freedom and\nthe eternity of the world, and follows it with a philosophical\ntreatment of the Trinity. William\u2019s vast work, On the\nUniverse, is divided into two principal parts. The first part\n(Ia, i.e. prima pars) is concerned with the corporeal\nuniverse and is in turn divided into three parts, the first (Ia-Iae,\ni.e. prima pars primae partis) arguing for a single first\nprinciple and for the oneness of the universe, the second (IIa-Iae)\ntaking up the question of the beginning of the universe and its future\nstate, and the third (IIIa-Iae) treating the governance of the\nuniverse through God\u2019s providence. The second principal part\n(IIa) is concerned with the spiritual universe, and is divided into\nthree parts concerning, respectively, the intelligences or spiritual\nbeings posited by Aristotle and his followers (Ia-IIae), the good and\nholy angels (IIa-IIae), and the bad and wicked angels, that is, demons\n(IIIa-IIae). On the Soul is concerned with the human soul. It\nis divided into seven parts concerning, respectively, its existence,\nits essence, its composition, the number of souls in a human being,\nhow the human soul comes into being, the state of the soul in the\nbody, and the soul\u2019s relation to God, with a focus on the human\nintellect.\n\nThe works comprising the second part of the Magisterium are\nmore expressly theological in nature and appeal to the authority of\nrevelation. Nevertheless, William continually recurs to his\nphilosophical doctrines in all his works, and even his most\ntheological writings contain material of considerable philosophical\ninterest. In particular, his treatises On Virtues and Morals\nand On Faith and Laws are of great importance for his moral\nphilosophy.\n\nScholars agree that On the Trinity is the earliest work in\nthe Magisterium and that it was probably written in the early\n1220s. The other works can be partially dated by references to\ncontemporaneous events, though the sheer size of many individual works\nsuggests they were probably written over a period of years. The whole\nMagisterium itself was probably written during a period\nextending from the early 1220s to around 1240, with On the\nUniverse written in the 1230s and On the Soul completed\nby around 1240.\n\nBesides the works contained in the Magisterium, other works\nof philosophical importance are De bono et malo I (On\nGood and Evil), where William develops a theory of value; De\nimmortalitate animae (On the Immortality of the\nSoul), a companion to the treatment of immortality in On the\nSoul; and De gratia et libero arbitrio (On Grace and\nFree Choice), a treatment of the Pelagian heresy.\n\nIn addition, William wrote some biblical commentaries, a number of\nother major theological works, and a large number of sermons (for\ndetails, see Ottman 2005). The more than 550 sermons that can be\nattributed to William have recently been critically edited by F.\nMorenzoni; they comprise four volumes in the Corpus\nChristianorum series (Opera homiletica, CCCM\n230\u2013230C).\n\nWith the exception of the sermons, most of William\u2019s works have\nnot been critically edited; several are extant only in manuscript\nform. The standard edition, which includes all the works that comprise\nthe Magisterium, is the 1674 Orl\u00e9ans-Paris Opera\nomnia (OO). (The sermons contained in this edition are by William\nPerrauld, not William of Auvergne.) As might be expected, the texts in\nthis old edition are often in need of correction; Teske has\nconjectured many corrections in his translations.\n",
