    "main_text": "Menger\u2019s Criticism\n6. Menger\u2019s Criticism\n\nMally\u2019s enterprise was received with little enthusiasm. As early as\n1926, it was noted that \u201cMr. Mally\u2019s deductions are frequently\nso amazingly obtuse and irrelevant that (despite his elaborate\nsymbolic apparatus) it is only necessary to state one or two of them\nto show how far his discussion has strayed from its self-appointed\ntask\u201d (Laird 1926, p. 395).\n\nIn 1939, Karl Menger published a devastating attack on Mally\u2019s system.\nHe first pointed out that A \u2194 !A is a theorem of this system. In\nother words, if A is the case, then A is obligatory, and if A ought to\nbe the case then A is indeed the case. As we have already noted in\nconnection with theorems (34) and (35), Mally made the same claim in\ninformal terms, but the formula A \u2194 !A does not occur in his\nbook.\n\nMenger\u2019s theorem A \u2194 !A may be proven as follows (Menger\u2019s proof\nwas different; PC denotes the propositional\ncalculus).\n\nFirst, A \u2192 !A is a theorem:\n\n\n1.\nA \u2192 ((!B \u2192 !B) & (B \u2192 A))\n[ PC\n ][5]\n\n\n2.\n((!B \u2192 !B) & (B \u2192 A)) \u2192 (!B\n\u2192 !A)\n[ I\u2032 ] \n\n3.\nA \u2192 (!B \u2192 !A)\n[ 1, 2, PC ] \n\n4.\n!B \u2192 (A \u2192 !A)\n[ 3, PC ] \n\n5a.\n!U\n[ Ax.\u00a0IV ] \n\n5b.\n!(!A \u2192 A)\n[ III\u2032(\u2192), PC ] \n\n6.\nA \u2192 !A\n[ 4, either 5a or 5b, PC ]\n\n\n \n\n\nSecond, !A \u2192 A is a theorem:\n\n\n1.\n((U \u2192 !A) & (A \u2192 \u2229)) \u2192 (U \u2192\n!\u2229)\n[ I\u2032 ] \n\n2.\n\u00ac((U \u2192 !A) & (A \u2192 \u2229))\n[ 1, V\u2032, PC ] \n\n3.\n\u00ac((U \u2192 !A) & (A \u2192 \u2229)) \u2192 (!A \u2192\nA)\n[ PC\n ][6]\n\n\n4.\n!A \u2192 A\n[ 2, 3, PC ] \n\n\nBecause A \u2192 !A and !A \u2192 A are theorems, A \u2194 !A is a\ntheorem as well.\n\nMenger gave the following comment:\n\n\nThis result seems to me to be detrimental for Mally\u2019s theory, however.\nIt indicates that the introduction of the sign ! is superfluous in the\nsense that it may be cancelled or inserted in any formula at any place\nwe please. But this result (in spite of Mally\u2019s philosophical\njustification) clearly contradicts not only our use of the word\n\u201cought\u201d but also some of Mally\u2019s own correct remarks about\nthis concept, e.g. the one at the beginning of his development to the\neffect that p \u2192 (!q or !r) and p \u2192 !(q or r) are not\nequivalent. Mally is quite right that these two propositions are not\nequivalent according to the ordinary use of the word\n\u201cought.\u201d But they are equivalent according to his theory\nby virtue of the equivalence of p and !p (Menger 1939,\np.\u00a058).\n\n\nAlmost all deontic logicians have accepted Menger\u2019s verdict. After\n1939, Mally\u2019s deontic system has seldom been taken seriously.\n",
