    "main_text": "His works || Or Hashem (The Light of the Lord)\n2.4 Or Hashem (The Light of the Lord)\n\nThis is without a doubt the major philosophical work (and indeed the\nmagnum opus) of\n Crescas.[11]\n This book was supposed to be the first part\nof a two-volume work that Crescas intended to write. The set was to be\nnamed Ner Elohim (Candle of God). The second book was to have\nbeen a work on Jewish law. The original aim of Crescas\u2019s project\nwas to counter the two major works of Maimonides by writing: I. A\nphilosophical book against Maimonides\u2019 Guide of the\nPerplexed. II. A legal book against his Mishneh Torah,\nin which Crescas would critique Maimonides\u2019 legal method, and\nespecially his lack of citations from earlier authorities. In fact,\nprobably in part because of his communal role after 1391, he only had\ntime to write the first book of the series, along with the general\nintroduction to both volumes.\n\n\nWe know that Or Hashem was written over a long period of\nCrescas\u2019s life \u2013 no less than fifteen years, and perhaps\nmore. Because of his communal activity, Crescas didn\u2019t finish the final\nedition of the book himself. Due to the extended period of\nwriting, we can see the development of his thought in the different\nparts of the work. In some cases, as with the attributes of God, there\nare some contradictions between the different layers of the\nbook\u2019s development. Additionally, the pupil who edited the last\nedition of the book introduced some changes and additions with the goal\nof unifying Crescas\u2019s seemingly opposing positions while\nmoderating his openly radical\n opinions.[12]\nExamples of these kinds of additions are clearly\nvisible in the question of free will, and are found especially in the\nFlorence manuscript.\n\n\nThe structure of Or Hashem is based on a hierarchical\narrangement of Jewish dogma opposed to the Maimonides thirteen\nprinciples of\n faith.[13]\nCrescas\nseparates his book into four different essays: \n\nThe existence of God (and relevant topics like his unity, his\nattributes, etc.). This is the foundation of all religious\nbelief.[14]\nThe six foundations of the law, without which the existence of the\nTorah (and in general of all revealed law) is impossible (Or\nHashem, 123). These six foundations are:\n \nGod\u2019s knowledge of all things in existence (including all\nparticulars)\nGod\u2019s providence\nGod\u2019s power\nProphecy\nFree will\nThe purpose of the Torah\n\n\nObligatory beliefs. The existence of the Torah is possible without\nthem, but if someone denies them he is a heretic. There are eight\ngeneral beliefs in the obligatory category:\n \n  \nThe creation of the world\nThe survival of the soul after death\nReward and Punishment (as per degree of conformity to the divine\ncommandments)\nResurrection\nThe eternity of the Torah\nThe prophetic stature of Moses\nThe Urim and Tumim (a mystical tool of the High Priest through\nwhich he could ask God questions)\nThe Messiah\n\n\nThere are three specific obligatory beliefs related to special\nreligious obligations: \n  \nPrayer and the priestly benediction\nRepentance\nRosh Hashana, The Fast of Kippur and the three pilgrimage\nfestivals.\n\n\nFourteen beliefs for which the Torah does not clearly establish\nwhat the correct opinions are. Regarding these beliefs Crescas\nexplores the different options and tries, using the interpretation of\nthe traditional Jewish sources together with philosophical enquiry, to\nestablish the correct view.\n\n",
