    "main_text": "Fazang (643\u2013712) || Three Nature Theory\n4.1 Three Nature Theory\n\nThe tenth and final chapter of Treatise on the Five Teachings of\nHuayan (Ch. Huayan Wujiao Zhang; T45.1866, trans. Cook\n1970) contains many of Fazang\u2019s most distinctive and important\ndoctrines. In the first section, Fazang develops his theory of the\nthree natures. The original theory was developed in Yogacara Buddhism,\nand posits three \u201crealities\u201d: first, that there is nothing\nbut ineffable, inexpressible reality that resembles space, gold, and\nwater in its absolute natural purity; second, that this reality\nappears as an unreal imaginative construction; and third, that this\nunreal construction is the basis for error, which arises through\nconfusing the construction for reality. \n\nIn his \n Three Natures Treatise,\n the Yogacara philosopher\nVasubandhu names the natures for each of these three\n\u201crealities.\u201d He says that inexpressible and ineffable\nreality has the nature of \u201cconsummation\u201d (or perfection):\nthis reality is perfect, and its nature is nothing other than\nemptiness. He says that unreal imaginative constructions, appearances\nappearing as nothing other than appearances, have the nature of\n\u201cother-dependence,\u201d which is synonymous with dependent\narising (pratitya-samutpada). He says, finally, that\nconfusions about unreal imaginative constructions have the nature of\n\u201cfabrication\u201d (or imagination, or discrimination). \n\nThe Madhyamaka tradition eventually endorsed a version of the three\nnature theory, albeit with some significant differences from the\nYogacara version. According to the Yogacara theory, while the\nfabricated nature is empty, the other-dependent and consummate natures\nare real. The imaginative constructions associated with the\nother-dependent nature\u2014the karmic seeds in the repository\nconsciousness\u2014must have some aspect that is real, according to\nYogacarins, lest there be nowhere for them to await their future\nactualization; and the ineffable reality associated with the\nconsummate nature also must have some aspect that is real, for the\nsake of avoiding the error of annihilationism. Madhyamakins reject the\nYogacarin reasoning as fallacious, preferring an epistemological\nrather than an ontological interpretation of the three natures. The\nchallenge with the epistemological interpretation, however, is making\nsense of how (delusional) appearances are possible in the absence of\nanything real. \n\nFazang\u2019s strategy for resolving this debate involves adapting\nthe perspective-taking tactic of the Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana to the three nature theory, ascribing two aspects to\neach nature. According to Fazang\u2019s theory, one of the two\naspects associated with each nature is fundamental, the other is\nderivative. The fundamental aspects are, respectively: pure and\nunchanging, lacking self-nature (svabhava), and non-existence\nfrom the standpoint of reality\u2014that is, being nothing more than\nconvention. The derivative aspects are: confluence to conditions,\napparent existence as thoroughly interdependent, and common-sense\nexistence (which involves a capacity to appear as if possessed of\nself-nature). \n\nYogacarins and Madhyamkins both endorse the derivative aspect for each\nnature. So Fazang\u2019s technique for justifying his theory is\ntwofold: first, argue that the fundamental aspects associated with\nthe three natures are compatible with each other; second, argue that\neach nature has its fundamental aspect if and only if it has its\nderivative aspect. Since everyone accepts that the derivative\naspects are legitimate and correct, it should then follow that the\nfundamental aspects are legitimate and correct as well.\nFazang\u2019s view thereby aims to include everything that is correct\nin the Yogacarin and Madyamakin views, while avoiding objections that\neach of those more limited views lodges against the other. \n\nFazang\u2019s three-nature theory foregrounds the other-dependent\nnature of reality\u2014how reality appears when conceptualized by\nthose lacking delusion and ignorance. This introduces the possibility\nof developing a metaphysical theory about reality as it appears to\nthose who are enlightened. Fazang endorses two complementary analyses\nof this reality. One analysis focuses on dharmas insofar as they are\nresults, investigating the nondual relationality of One Mind (as\ncause) and the entirety of dharmas (as result). The other\nanalysis focuses on dharmas insofar as they are causes,\ninvestigating the mutual inclusion and identity among each individual\ndharma and all remaining dharmas. \n",
