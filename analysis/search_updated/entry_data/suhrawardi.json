    "preamble": "\n\nTrained in Avicennan Peripateticism, Shihab al-Din al-Suhrawardi\n(1154\u20131191) has become the eponym of an\n\u2018Illuminationist\u2019 (ishraqi) philosophical\ntradition. Since none of his works was translated into Latin, he\nremained unknown in the West. However, a number of philosophical\ncircles in the Islamic East studied his works from the 13th\ncentury onwards. Around the mid-20th century, Henry Corbin\nworked relentlessly to edit and publish Suhrawardi\u2019s works,\nefforts that generated much interest in his novel philosophical\nsystem, which a new generation of scholars rekindled in the 1990s.\n\nSuhrawardi provides an original Platonic critique of the dominant\nAvicennan Peripateticism of the time in the fields of logic, physics,\nepistemology, psychology, and metaphysics. In so doing, he elaborates\nhis own epistemological (logic and psychology) and metaphysical\n(ontology and cosmology) ishraqi notions, concepts and\ntheories. He divided logic into three-parts, rejecting\nAvicenna\u2019s Peripatetic essentialist definition, and reducing the\nnumber of forms of the syllogism. In physics, he rejected\nAvicenna\u2019s hylomorphism, while bodies became magnitude with\naccidents.\n\nHis new epistemological perspective led him to critique the Avicennan\nPeripatetic theory of definition, to introduce a theory of\n\u2018presential\u2019 knowledge (mirroring mystical intuition), to\nelaborate a complex ontology of lights, and to add a fourth\nontological \u2018world of images\u2019 where imagination plays an\ninnovative eschatological function, expanding on insightful allusions\nmade by Avicenna. \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n1.1 Life\n\nBiographical data on the life of Shihab al-Din al-Suhrawardi, the\n\u2018Master of Illumination\u2019 (shaykh al-ishraq), is\nscarce. Born in the northwestern Iranian village of Suhraward around\n1154, he pursued his education in nearby Maraghah with Majd al-Din\nal-Jili, one of the teachers of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1210). He then\ntraveled to Isfahan, where he studied with the logician Zahir (al-Din)\nal-Farisi (or Qari) with whom he read the Nasiri\nObservations, a text on logic penned by \u2018Umar Ibn Sahlan\nal-Sawi (or Sawaji) (d.ca.1158). Suhrawardi then embarked on a journey\nin search of knowledge. According to Shams al-Din al-Shahrazuri\n(d.ca.1288), he would have traveled extensively throughout Anatolia\nand befriended Sufi masters, such as Fakhr al-Din al-Mardini (d.1198)\n(who also taught medicine and Avicennan works), seemingly seeking\nspiritual guidance and experiences, Suhrawardi leading himself the\nlife of a wondering ascetic (retreats, ascetic practices) (Shahrazuri,\n1988). The putative classical Sufi spiritual lineage put forward by\nbiographers and Suhrawardi himself partake of Suhrawardi\u2019s\nclaims to revive the intellectual heritage of a long intitiatic chain\nof transmitters who possessed \u2018true\u2019 knowledge, that of\nthe Ancients (Husrawaniyyun) (Landolt, 2008, 240\u2013242).\nLike most scholars of the time, Suhrawardi was also seeking patrons\nduring his travels among the local Anatolian rulers.\n\nIn 1183, Suhrawardi arrived in Aleppo, the year the Ayyubid ruler,\nSaladin (d.1193), conquered the city and handed it over to his son\nal-Zahir (d.1216). A Shafi\u2018i Sunni, Suhrawardi made a name for\nhimself among the religious scholars of the city (Marcotte, 2001,\n399\u2013400). He eventually managed to secure an audience at the\npalace, and to befriend al-Zahir. In 1186, he completed his most\nimportant work, the Philosophy of Illumination (hereafter\n PI),[1]\n at the age of thirty-three. Sometime in 1189 or soon therafter,\n\u2018Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi met Suhrawardi in Aleppo, probably\nafter having come across Suhrawardi\u2019s Intimations,\nFlashes of Light (al-Lamahat) and Ascending\nSteps (al-Ma\u2018arij) while in Mosul, works he did\nnot find useful, most probably because Suhrawardi (that\n\u2018imbecile\u2019) had rejected foundamental elements of\nPeripateticism of which he was fond (Martini Bonadeo, 2015, 2013,\n124\u2013125). And there is a possibly apcryphal meeting Suhrawardi\nhad with Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (Nasr and Aminrazavi, 2010, 185). \n\nA combination of religious and political factors led to\nSuhrawardi\u2019s downfall, namely the fact that he succeeded in\nalienating the powerful religious elite of Aleppo, on whom the\nAyyubids depended for the legitimacy of their rule over the city, by\nalways gaining the upper hand when he debated with the learned of the\ncity, none of whom were able to keep up intellectually with him, and\nseemingly behaving in such a manner as to display a condescending\narrogance for the scholars of Aleppo (Marcotte, 2001, 400\u2013401).\nOn the one hand, he was accused of holding heretical beliefs, a vague\ncharge easily supported with the pre-Islamic Persian names and symbols\nthat some of his works contained, his claim to divine-like\ninspiration, and his questioning, in light of God\u2019s omnipotence,\nthe logical finality of Prophethood. On the other hand, his\nassociation with al-Zahir, the Ayyubid ruler, and his earlier\nrelationships with the recently conquered Artuqids, one of the local\nrulers of southwest Anatolia to whom his Tablets to\n\u2018Imad (written in Aleppo) was dedicated, may have been\ninterpreted as political intrigue or, at worst, holding Isma\u2018ili\nviews: Suhrawardi\u2019s views regarding the \u2018Caliph of God on\nEarth\u2019; the hierarchical conception of being structured around\nthe \u2018victorial domination (qahr)\u2019 relation of\n\u2018irridiations\u2019 (shuruq) of light in terms similar\nto the Arabic \u2018Empedoclean\u2019 views found in the works of\nSijistani (d. after 971) or the Ikhwan al-Safa\u2019, etc. (Landolt,\n2008, 242\u2013244). \n\nIn the end, Suhrawardi\u2019s fate was sealed with accusations of\nheresy (rather than treason). Biographers and historians remained at\nodds over the exact charges and course of events that led to his\nexecution at the end of 1191 (or early1192) (Marcotte 2001a). \n1.2 Works\n\nVarious classifications exist of Suhrawardi\u2019s works, with either\nthree (Massigon), four (Corbin, Walbridge and Ziai), five (Nasr 1964,\n58\u20139) or six (Kadivar 2011, 297\u20138) categories (Suh. 1993a,\nvii\u2013xvii, xviii\u2013xx). Although very few of his works can be\ndated, Walbridge (2017, 257\u20138), guided by indications found in\nhis works, established the following classification that takes into\naccount the overlapping redaction of some of the texts: (i)\njuvenilia (before ca. 1180), such as Temples of\nLight (Suh. 1996), his allegories (many in Persian) depicting the\njourney of the soul (Suh. 1976, 1993c, 1999b, 2001, 2007), but also a\ntranslation into Persian of Avicenna\u2019s Treatise of the\nBird, a commentary of the latter\u2019s Pointers and\nReminders, and his take on the latter\u2019s Treatise on\nLove; (ii) mature Peripatetic works (from 1180 to 1186), like\nFlashes of Light and Intimations (completed before\nPI), a pr\u00e9cis of Avicennan Peripatetic theses\n(Suh. 1993a, 1\u2013121 [metaphysics], 2009a [logic, physics,\nmetaphysics]; cf. Ibn Kammuna 2003, 2009); (iii) Philosophy of\nIllumination (completed in 1186) in which he details the main\nrules, principles and arguments of his ishraqi) philosophical\nsystem, the symbolism of Light resting at the heart of his\nreconfiguration of a number of cosmological and ontological\nPeripatetic theses put forward by Avicenna ; (iv) other Peripatetic\nworks (completed by 1186): Paths and Havens (completed when\nhe was almost 30; probably early 1180s) (Suh. 1993a, 194\u2013506\n[metaphysics], 2006 [logic], 2015 [physics]), and Opposites\n(Suh. 1993a, 124\u201392 [metaphysics], cf. 2009b), revisiting issues\ndiscussed in the Philosophy of Illumination; and (v) other\nshort works (from 1180 to 1185), such as Tablets for \u2018Imad (Suh.\n2001, 31\u201398 [Ar.], 1993c, 110\u201395 [Pers.], 1976,\n99\u2013116 [Corbin]), and his shorter Book of Hours-like\nArabic prayers, supplications (du\u2018a) and intimate\ndevotions (munajat), \u2018occult invocations\u2019\n(prayers to celestial bodies) (Walbridge 2011; Suh., 1976),\ncommentaries on some verses of the Qur\u2019an (Nurbakhsh 2007), and\npoetry (Suh. 2005). \n\nCorbin (d.1978) noted that there might not have been a purely\nPeripatetic intellectual period, though Suhrawardi asserts he defended\nthe approach in his youth (PI, \u00a7166), if, indeed, he\ncomposed most of his treatises over a very short span of time,\nprobably during the course of about ten years. Moreover, a number of\nhis works expound both Peripatetic and ishraqi principles,\nlike Tablets to \u2018Imad (written after PI,\nduring the last five years of his life) and Temples of Light\n(Suh. 1996, 1976, 139\u201347). Likewise, although\nIntimations is said to be written according to the\nPeripatetic tradition (PI, \u00a73) whose principles\nSuhrawardi\u2019s reexamined (Suh. 1993a, 2), it prepares the ground\nfor some of the Philosophy of Illumination\u2019s more\ndistinctive Illuminationist positions (Suh. 1993a, 70\u20138,\n105\u201321; (Walbridge 2017, 256\u20139). \n\nThus, one must take into account the interrelations between\nSuhrawardi\u2019s five major philosophical works, which contain\ncross-references, to grasp fully his system as a whole. Walbridge\n(2017, 258) proposes the following order of Suhrawardi\u2019s majors\nworks: (i) Intimations (completed before PI); (ii)\nPhilosophy of Illumination (completed in 1186); (iii)\nPaths and Havens and Flashes of Light (written\nsimultaneously with PI, but completed later, cf. Suh. 1991,\n142.10, 146.14 [Najafquli ed., 175.19-20], cf. 1988, 207.5, 215.6,\n2001, 241.2-4); and (iv) Opposites (written after the\ncompletion of PI and Paths and Havens) (cf.\nSuhrawardi\u2019s order: Intimations, then\nOpposites, followed by Paths and Havens, and ending\nwith PI). \n\nIn his quest to revive the intellectual heritage of all those who had\nmastered \u2018true\u2019 knowledge, i.e. that of the Ancients for\nthe East and the West, Suhrawardi tapped into an experiential-like\ntype of knowledge. In his \u2019s Philosophy of\nIllumination, he mentioned that the work was written with the\nobjective of disclosing what he says he \u201cobtained through my\nintuition during my retreats and visions. [\u2026] the present work has\nanother method and provides a shorter path to knowledge [\u2026] I did\nnot first arrive at it through cogitation; rather, it was acquired\nthrough something else. Subsenquently I sought proof for it, so that,\nshould I cease contemplating the proof, nothing would make me fall\ninto doubt. In all that I have said about the science of lights and\nthat which is and is not based upon it, I have been assisted by those\nwho have traveled the path of God. This science is the very intuition\nof the inspired and illumined Plato, the guide and master of\nphilosophy\u201d, and those who came before and after him\n(PI, \u00a7\u00a72\u20134). This is the ishraqi\nmethod, with all its principles and rules, that builds upon, modifies\nand complements the principles at the heart of the Peripatetic method\n(notably Avicenna\u2019s). It seems reasonable to cast\nSuhrawardi\u2019s project as a critique of Avicenna\u2019s Plato and\nNeoplatonizing brand of Peripateticism, similar to the various\ncritiques put forward by Shahrastani (d.1153), Abu al-Barakat\nal-Baghdadi (d.ca.1142), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1210) and al-Ghazali\n(d.1111), etc.\n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s works circulated mainly within traditional circles\nof learning in the Islamic East. At the beginning of the\n20th century and in the wake of the works of Bernard Carra\nde Vaux (1902), Max Horten (1912), Otto Spies and Sarfaraz K. Khatak\n(1935), and Helmut Ritter (1938), the French Iranologist, Henry Corbin\nbegan to study Suhrawardi\u2019s works after having received, from\nLouis Massigion, a copy of Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi\u2019s commentary\non the Philosophy of Illumination. Corbin embarked on a\nlifelong project of edition, translation and study of\nSuhrawardi\u2019s works. A first volume, published in Istanbul in\n1945 (Suh. 1993a), contained the metaphysics of three major Arabic\nworks of Suhrawardi. Corbin then edited, in 1952, the Arabic\nmagnum opus, the Philosophy of Illumination (Suh.\n1993b, 1999a, 1986), together with two minor works. He went on to\nwrite a number of translations and studies, namely Suhrawardi et\nles platoniciens de Perse (Corbin 1971; cf. Abu Rayyan 1969; Suh.\n1999b). In 1970, Hossein Nasr edited fourteen of his Persian texts\n(two attributed to him), many allegorical or mystical in nature (Suh.\n1976, 1993c, 1999b). \n1.3 Influences on Suhrawardi\n\nMapping Suhrawardi\u2019s intellectual trajectory and identifying the\nsources he may have used proves difficult, notably because he states\nhe was first a \u2018zealous\u2019 defender of the Peripatetic\ntradition, and was later assisted by those who \u201chave travelled\nthe path of God\u201d and mastered the \u2018science of\nintuition\u2019, the likes of \u201cthe inspired and illuminated\nPlato\u201d, Hermes, Empedocles, Pythagoras, etc. among the Greeks\nand Jamasp, Frashostar, Bozorgmehr, etc. among the Ancient Persians\n(PI, \u00a73; cf. Suh. 1993a, 502\u20134). His philosophical\nproject sought to revive the wisdom (hikma) of the Ancients,\ntapping into this double (Eastern/Western) initiatic genealogy of\nSages and from the Greek and Arab philosophers who threaded the\n\u2018path of God\u2019.\n\nInstructed in the Avicennan Peripatetic tradition, Suhrawardi studied\nthe views of Aristotle, Plato, the Neoplatonists, and later\nphilosophers (falasifa) who wrote in Arabic, notably\nAvicenna\u2019s (d.1037) whose major works remained central. Work is\nstill needed to assess the nature of the influence exerted on him by\nAvicenna\u2019s other works, for instance, his Discussions\n(1992) and Notes on Aristotle\u2019s De anima\n(1984), and by post-Avicennan philosophers, particularly Abu\nal-Barakat al-Baghdadi (d.ca.1165), the original yet eclectic critic\nof Avicenna\u2019s logic, psychology and metaphysics, Fakhr al-Din\nal-Razi (d.1210), and the the innovative Ibn Sahlan al-Sawi (the\nlogician) (d.ca. 1158).\n\nCharting Suhrawardi\u2019s intellectual journey and encounters with\nmysticism, ancient Greek Gnosticism and Hermeticism, or ancient\nPersian Zoroastrian traditions, to whose symbols he often appeals,\nremains exceedingly difficult (Muwahhid 1995). Some have attempted to\ntrace the Greek influences of such figures as Empedocles, Pythagoras,\nHermes, etc. in his work, an exercise that has, for example, rendered\nhim a \u2018Pythagoreanizing Neoplatonist\u2019 (Walbridge 2000,\n2001) with more or less success (Gutas 2003, 308). \n\nSuhrawardi frequently appeals to the authority of Plato. This includes\nmaterial from the Arabic (pseudo)Theology of Aristotle (a\nparaphrase of parts of Books IV-VI of Plotinus\u2019\nEnneads) that he attributes to Plato, perhaps because the\nlatter is mentioned more than once at the end of the first chapter\n(D\u2019Ancona 2004). This is evidenced where Suhrawardi quotes or\nalludes to a passage from the (pseudo)Theology of Aristotle\n(I.21\u201326; cf. Enneads 4.8.1) that he ascribes to Plato\n(PI, \u00a7171; cf. Suh. 1993a, ), a passage to which he\nagain alludes (PI, \u00a7171), and again in summary form in\nhis Intimations (Talwihat) (Suh. 1993a, 112; cf.\nWalbridge, 2000, 134\u2013137; (for a number of specific overlaps,\nsee Arnzen, 2011, 119\u2013150 and Sinai, 2011 [commentary on\n\u00a7\u00a7 4, 94, 109, 129 and 171]). Shahrazuri seems to have known\nthe work as the Kitab al-Mimar (the Arabic term of the\ndivision headings of the work). Moreover, the Theology\ncontains passages (Enneads IV, 8.1) that mention many\nphilosophers of the Greek tradition to which Suhrawardi states being\nthe heir. Why Suhrawardi \u201cpresented himself as\nfollowing these ancient philosophers, and especially Plato, rather\nthan Avicenna\u201d has yet to be elucidated and adequately explained\n(Gutas 2003, 308\u20139). \n\nIn addition, possible influences of Ismailism or Sufism have yet to be\nfully explored: some elements of his ishraqidoctrine may have\nmore affinity with Ismaili thought (such as the hierarchical notion of\nbeing in the works of 10th century Abu Ya\u2018qub\nal-Sijistani) than with the doctrines of classical Sufis whom he\nclaims to be following (Landolt 1987), although similarities with\ncertain Sufi theories have been identified (Landolt 2008,\nforthcoming). Medieval biographers, on the other hand, readily\nreported Suhrawardi\u2019s mystical inclination, his association with\nmystics, his ascetic practices and (hagiographic) wondrous deeds. He\nhimself considered spiritual exercises a necessary preparation for the\nadvent of \u2018presential\u2019 (huduri) knowledge and\nvision of the Lights. \n\nSuhrawardi also appeals to ancient Zoroastrian motifs, terminology and\nmythical figures, even Mazdean theology, for example, in his\nInvocations and Prayers (Suh. 1976; Mo\u2018in 1950; cf.\nGaffari 2001, 375\u201385; see the occult and devotional works\nunearthed by Walbridge 2011). For some, his appeal to angels as\nembodiments of intellective light principles has been likened to\nancient Zoroastrian (Corbin 1971, 111\u20133, 124\u20135) or Mazdean\n(Nasr 1964, 71) angelology; for others, it echoes the angels found in\nAbu al-Barakat al-Baghdadi\u2019s al-Mu\u2018tabar\n(What Has Been Established Through Personal Reflection)\n(1939, vol. 2, 157; cf. Pines 1979, 253\u20135), the latter being\ndevoid of any ancient Persian symbolism. Without any clear historical\nfiliations to particular textual traditions, one can only rely on\nSuhrawardi\u2019s own claims to have intended to provide a synthesis\nof those ancient Western and Eastern intellectual traditions. \n2. Logic\n2.1 Role of Logic\n\nVery little has been written about Suhrawardi\u2019s logical\ntreatises or his logic in general, namely because most of his logical\nworks remain unedited, and few scholars of Islamic philosophy delve\ninto logic. Hussein Ziai (1990) provides perhaps the only general\noverview of his logic, his criticisms of Peripatetic\n(Aristotelian/Avicennan) essentialist definitions and his\nishraqi theory of definition. While Suhrawardi includes\nlogical discussions in his major Arabic works, in the Philosophy\nof Illumination, he criticizes and restructures some elements of\nPeripatetic logic. For Shahrazuri (1988), his works bear the marks of\nextensive study of the Nasiri Observations of Ibn Sahlan\nal-Sawi (1988, 378), a non-Aristotelian Persian Logician who\nreorganized the content of the Organon. The work may have\ninspired Suhrawardi\u2019s restructuring of the logic, in\nIntimations, into expository propositions, wherein definition\nand description become part of his semantic theory, and theory of\nproofs (hujaj) (Ziai 1990, 45, 51\u20136). Noteworthy is\nZiai\u2019s reconceptualization of Suhrawardi\u2019s pragmatic use\nof logic into three parts: semantics, formal logic and techniques, and\nmaterial logic (Ziai, 1990, 73\u201375).\n\nThe Philosophy of Illumination does not follow the customary\ntripartite logic, physics, and metaphysics division of many\nPost-Avicennan Peripatetic works. It is divided into two main parts.\nThe first part, divided into three \u2018discourses\u2019,\nintroduces \u2018Rules of Thought\u2019 that cover not only logic,\nbut also some elements of physics and metaphysics (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a77\u2013106). The seven rules of the first discourse are\non knowledge and definition (see 2.2 below) (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a77\u201315). The first five rules pertain to logic and\ndeal with subject matter found in the Isagoge and derived\nfrom the Avicennan Peripatetic tradition (Ziai 1990, 58\u201367).\nFirst, Suhrawardi introduces elements of semantics, where are\ndiscussed problems of meaning, the distinction between conception and\nassent, and on the nature, definition and description of\n\u2018reality\u2019 (haqiqa), the latter being equated by\nQutb al-Din Shirazi (d.1311) with quiddity (mahiyya). Then,\nhe discusses accidents, universals (his nominalist ontology), and the\ninnate (fitriyya) and acquired nature of human knowledge\n(intuition, personal revelation, and inspiration being prior in\nessence, while logic being applicable only to the latter) (Mousavian\n2014a, 478; cf. Walbridge 2014; Mousavian 2014b). \n\nThe seven sections of the second discourse pertain to proofs and their\nprinciples (PI, \u00a7\u00a716\u201333). Suhrawardi\nintroduces short discussions to describe propositions and syllogisms,\nthe classes and the modalities in propositions. He proposes to reduce\nall types of propositions to necessary affirmative propositions. He\ncriticizes the Peripatetics\u2019 understanding of negation and\ndiscusses the differences between the Peripatetics and his novel views\nregarding a number of sophisms, for example, reducing the second and\nthird figures to the first figure, and reducing modal propositions to\none form. Street (2008, 165, 175) also showed that Suhrawardi\n\u201creduces all his modal propositions to the appropriate\ndefinitely necessary version\u201d in accord with Avicenna\u2019s\nsyllogistic; this enables him \u201cto express the truths of\nessentialism\u201d befitting for his \u201cessentialist\nmetaphysics\u201d, thus making him a \u201cdefender and\nexpositor\u201d Avicenna\u2019s modal logic. He also discusses\ncontradiction, conversion, conditionals, demonstrative syllogisms, and\nreductio ad absurdum, the latter also discussed in the third\ndiscourse (Ziai 1990, 67\u201372). In Intimations, he\ndescribes the distinct syllogistic forms used in dialectics, rhetoric,\nand poetics, for example, the non-demonstrative syllogism of poetry\ndue to its imagined and non-scientific premises (Ziai 1990, 54). \n\nThe third discourse presents sophistical refutations of errors\nuncovered in the formal and material logic of Peripatetic logic (an\nepitome of the Sophistical Refutations of the Organon)\n(PI, \u00a7\u00a734\u2013106). The third section deals with\na number of his ishraqi judgements against a number of\nPeripatetic issues of physics and metaphysics (see 3. and 4.). It also\nserves to establish certain \u201ctechnical terms\u201d (substance\nand accident, necessity and contingency, cause, and possible and\nimpossible infinities) (PI, \u00a752\u20135), and on\n\u2018beings of reason\u2019 (i\u2018tibarat\n\u2018aqliyya) (existence, necessity, etc.) (PI,\n56\u201368). Suhrawardi also revisits the classical theory of the\ncategories, adopting a reduced non-Peripatetic classification of five\ncategories: \u2018substance\u2019 (jawhar),\n\u2018quantity\u2019, \u2018quality\u2019, \u2018relation\u2019\n(similar to Stoic reduction of categories to those four, cf. Walbridge\n1996, 527), to which he adds \u2018motion\u2019 (absent in Ibn\nSahlan), the latter four being accidental categories (PI,\n\u00a771; Suh. 1993a, 4\u201312, 284\u201393; Ziai 1990, 72 n.2, 73\nn.3; Beidokhti 2018, 394\u2013400). An \u2018intensity\u2019 (or\nperfection) is predicated of those five categories, such that the\ndegree of intensity (with its corollary \u2018weakness\u2019) of\nlight becomes a property of substances as well as of accidents (Ziai\n1990, 73\u20135). \n2.2 Definition\n\nRule seven of the first discourse is dedicated to the notion of\ndefinition, its conditions and reconfiguration into an\nishraqi principle (PI, \u00a7\u00a713\u20135; Ziai\n1990, 77\u2013114). Suhrawardi begins by rejecting the Peripatetic\ntheory of definition that he criticizes for the inductive approach it\nadvocates as a foundation for scientific knowledge and demonstration.\nHe uses logical and semantic arguments to question its\n\u2018essentialist\u2019 definition (Aristotelian) on which\nAvicenna\u2019s own \u2018complete definition\u2019 depends. He\nrejects the claims that it is possible to obtain a complete definition\nable to encompass all the essential constituents needed to lead to the\nknowledge of that which is previously unknown and in need of a\ndefinition. Suhrawardi writes that \u201cit is clear that it is\nimpossible for a human being to construct an essential definition in\nthe way the Peripatetics require\u2014a difficulty which even their\nmaster [Aristotle or Avicenna] admits. Therefore, we have definition\nonly by means of things that specify by conjunction\u201d\n(PI, \u00a715). Suhrawardi insists that a definition should\nenumerate, in some kind of unitary formula, all the essential\nconstituents of the described object. Therefore, he includes elements\nof definition by extension (enumeration of members of a\n\u2018class\u2019) and of definition by intension (enumeration of\ndefining property or properties), for example, that \u201cthe essence\nof man (which is the truth underlying the symbol \u2018man\u2019),\nis a thing which is only recoverable [\u2026] in the\nsubject. This act of \u2018recovery\u2019 is the translation of the\nsymbol to its equivalent in the consciousness or the self of the\nsubject\u201d (Ziai 1990, 127). For Street (2008, 178), what he calls\nhis \u2018anti-essentialism\u2019, or the inability to graps\nessences discursively, as he accepts the Platonic forms, does not rest\non his logic. Suhrawardi explains his \u2018conceptualist\u2019\nnotion of definition at greater length in his Paths and\nHavens (Suh. 2006, 83, 90\u2013100). His epistemological\ncritique of the Peripatetic theory of definition is undoubtedly\ninspired by Abu al-Barakat al-Baghdadi\u2019s own critical evaluation\nof the Isagoge which was developed in his\nal-Mu\u2018tabar (1939, vol. 1, 55\u20137; cf. Ziai 1990,\n183\u20134), but also by Suhrawardi\u2019s own understanding of the\nepistemic role of self-knowledge as presence. \n\nIn the Philosophy of Illumination, Suhrawardi introduces his\nishraqi theory of definition that signals what some have\nidentified as a \u2018Platonic\u2019 or \u2018Neoplatonic\u2019\nturn (Ziai 1990, 114\u2013128). Now, only direct experience\nguarantees acquisition of true knowledge, such that epistemological\nconsiderations are at the heart of his reconceptualization of the\ndefinition. Suhrawardi\u2019s theory of definition thus builds on a\nPlatonic (perhaps even Neoplatonic) epistemology. Knowledge of the\nreality of things occurs through the direct apprehension of the\nintrinsic light-nature (the thing as it is) of all entities\n(see 4.). Direct knowledge occurs through\n\u2018vision-illumination\u2019, as a person realizes that what is\nto be defined becomes available to one\u2019s self through\nself-consciousness. At such time, the soul becomes directly\naware of the reality of that which is to be defined. The soul is then\nable to grasp directly those essences whose elements can then be\ntranslated using proofs and demonstrations to develop a discursive\ntype of knowledge about that original apperception of reality. \n\nIn his Paths and Havens, Suhrawardi notes that to define\nsomething is to actually \u2018see\u2019 the thing as it really is\n(Ziai 1990, 104\u201314). Suhrawardi opens the second part of his\nPhilosophy of Illumination with the following principle:\n\u201canything in existence that requires no definition or\nexplanation is evident. Since there is nothing more evident than\nlight, there is nothing less in need of definition\u201d\n(PI, \u00a7107). Light, in and of itself, is not in need of\nany definition, because in and of itself it is self-evident. Here,\nSuhrawardi posits the epistemological and ontological centrality of\nthe concept of light. He argues that only direct intuitive experience\ncan lead to knowledge of the reality (haqiqa) of things,\nwhich definitions can only attempt to describe and explain via a\nposteriori rational investigations or demonstrations (Ziai 1990,\n81). Qutb al-Din Shirazi notes that ishraqi epistemology\nrelies on this type of personal and intuitive knowledge, itself not in\nneed of any definition (Ziai 1990, 133).\n\n3. Physics\n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Intimations, Paths and Havens,\nOpposites and Flashes of Light all contain sections\non physics, although they have remained unstudied. Of those, only the\nphysics of the Flashes of Light (2001, 185\u2013209; 1991\n[Najafquli ed.]) and of Intimations have been edited, the\nlatter together with a commentary by Ibn Kammuna (2003). In the third\ndiscourse of the Philosophy of Illumination, and in Paths\nand Havens (though not in Flashes of Light or\nIntimations), Suhrawardi reviews some general principles of\nphysics (albeit not in detail). Like Avicenna before him, he rejects\nthe atomism of the theologians (PI, \u00a789), as well as the\nidea of a vacuum (PI, \u00a7\u00a789\u201390). He also\ncriticizes and rejects (Aristotelian) Peripatetic hylomorphic division\nof bodies into matter and form, rejecting the notion of prime matter.\nShurawardi provides a number of arguments for his rejection of\nhylomorphism (PI, \u00a772\u201388). One of them relies on\nhis theory of bodies that now consist of \u201cself-subsistent\nmagnitude with accidents\u201d (Walbridge 2017, 266\u20137), a\n\u201ccompound of extension and properties just as Simplicius\u201d.\nIn addition, he needed \u201cthat accidents be able to constitute\ncauses, for it is the causality of accidents that makes it possible to\nexplain the existence of the Platonic Forms and ultimately to explain\nthe diversity of the celestial and sublunary reals\u201d. Moreover,\nhe held that \u201centities that cannot be perceived either by\nphysical senses or by nonsensible intuition\u201d, for example\n\u2018forms\u2019, \u201ccannot be known, and if they exist, it is\nonly as mental constructs\u201d. These are important critiques and\nreformulations of physics to assist him in his reformulation of his\nmetaphysics. Bodies become \u2018barriers\u2019 or \u201cthings\nthat acquire properties from the lights\u201d that differ in\n\u2018intensity\u2019 (Walbridge, 2005, 240\u2013242). Hylomorphism\nbecomes incompatible with the possibility of knowing real essences,\nthe \u2018ontic\u2019 luminous essence, of all entities, that of\nimmaterial lights and of \u2019s own self, which cannot be known via\na postulated \u2018form\u2019 (Ziai 1990, 131, 151\u20132). The\ndetermination of different bodies now \u201cdepends on the\nmulti-aspect movement and internal relationships of strong and weak\nlights\u201d, intensity becoming the ontological discriminating\ncriterion (Arslan 2014, 150; PI, \u00a774). \n\nWith his philosophy of lights, he manages, nonetheless, to reconfigure\nsome elements of physics. For instance, immaterial entities and\nmaterial bodies are composed of varying degrees of intensity of light.\nThe physical world is composed of dusky substances with dark\naccidents, while self-subsistent magnitude appears to replace prime\nmatter which, like a number of traditional physical notions, becomes a\nmere mental concept that has no reality outside the mind. It is no\nlonger the perception of the form of objects, but their constitutive\nlights that becomes the true object of knowledge (Walbridge 2000,\n22\u20133). \n3.1 Psychology\n\nSuhrawardi revisits Avicenna\u2019s psychology, the framework out of\nwhich he elaborates his original ishraqi psychology. While he\nfinds inadequate the Peripatetic proofs for the immortality of the\nsoul (PI, \u00a7\u00a791\u20133),the soul remains an\nimmaterial, self-subsisting, living, knowing substance, capable of\nruling over the body. However, he defines its substance in terms of\nthe intensity of its individual luminosity. Thereupon, a relation of\ndominion (qahr) and love (mahabba) or desire\n(\u2018ishq) is established between the luminous substance\nof the soul and the tenebrous substance of the body (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7147\u20138). Between the two, the subtle substance of the\n(psychic) pneuma (ruh) functions as an intermediary\nthat enables the reception of images, forms or \u2018icons\u2019 of\nmetaphysical realities that it then reflects and manifests onto the\nsoul (PI, \u00a7\u00a7216\u20137). \n\nVision remains the most important sense. It rests at the heart of\nSuhrawardi\u2019s ishraqi theory of vision that provides,\nonce redefined, a mode of apprehension upon which can be modelled his\ntheory of knowledge by presence. He criticizes and rejects the\nmaterialist implications of the imprinting of forms in the material\nsubstratum of the eye implied in the prevalent\n\u2018extramissive\u2019 and \u2018intromissive\u2019 theories of\nvision. Although mediated by a physical organ, vision remains instead\nprimarily an activity of the human (light) soul, whereby the soul\naccesses directly the reality of the objects of vision (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7101\u20134). In the Philosophy of Illumination,\nthe vision of physical objects requires, first, a\n\u2018presential\u2019 face-to-face encounter of that which\nperceives, both the physical organ and the human soul, and the\nilluminated object; second, the absence of obstacles between subject\nand object, often described in mystical terms as the absence of veils,\nwhereby the soul becomes illuminated by the (substantial or\naccidental) light of the object; and, finally, the presence of light,\nthe necessary condition for the establishment of this ishraqi\nrelation. Vision thus unfolds simultaneously on two different planes,\nphysical visual perception being reduced to the soul\u2019s\nperception or awareness of the intrinsic and essential light possessed\nby the object, with which it shares a light reality. Therefore, true\nvision does not require the acquisition and transmission of forms, but\noccurs through the soul\u2019s ability to be aware of the essential\nlight-reality of the object. Hence, physics and metaphysics merge, as\nvisible objects have the ability to receive and emit light, though\nonly in an accidental manner, light being precisely what the managing\n(mudabbira) light-soul, the Isfahbad-light, is able to\nperceive, whether it be through the senses, the soul/intellect,\nintuition, or dreams (PI, \u00a7\u00a7145\u20136). A certain\ntype of intuitive (innate) knowledge of the light rests at the heart\nof vision (PI, \u00a7226) and upon which discursive knowledge\nmay subsequently validate rationally through demonstrations\n(Ha\u2019iri Yazdi 1992; Dinani 1985). \n\nSuhrawardi also criticizes the localization of the internal faculties\nin different parts of the brain, since localizing them in a material\norgan again naturalizes the process of representation. Internal\nfaculties now become shadows (or functions) of the soul, lumped\ntogether into a single faculty responsible for representation. The\nIsfahbad-light principle accesses the dominating (qahira)\nlights, rules over the active imagination, and reflects onto it the\nlights it receives and grasps. The faculty of representation perceives\nparticulars, while the governing (mudabbira) light, the\nIsfahbad-light principle that guarantees the unity of the soul, can\nperceive universals and immaterial entities. The emphasis on the\nwholeness of the soul, as the main perceiving entity, and the\nreduction of the Avicennan faculties traditionally responsible for\nrepresentation to a single faculty could find their origin in Abu\nal-Barakat al-Baghdadi\u2019s al-Mu\u2018tabar (1939, vol.\n2, 318\u201324; cf. Pines 1979, 227\u201331). As for recollection,\nSuhrawardi defines it in a rather Platonic manner, whereby it becomes\nthe retrieval of images (or concepts) whose existence lies in the\n\u2018world of memorial\u2019, accessible only to the luminous part\nof the soul, though not in the manner of the Platonic theory of\nknowledge by recollection of the soul\u2019s prior knowledge it\npossessed before its temporal origination with its body. \n\nFor Suhrawardi, illumination becomes a metaphor for the intellective\nprocess. Illuminative relations take place between metaphysical active\nlight principles and the human soul (Marcotte forthcoming). Whereas\nonly the (rational) Isfahbad-light part of the soul is immortal,\nSuhrawardi, nevertheless, notes the possibility for the imaginative\nfaculty of souls that have not yet achieved perfection to\n\u201cescape to the world of suspended images, whose locus is one of\nthe celestial barriers\u201d that would function as an\n\u2018astral\u2019 body, bringing \u201cimages into being\u201d\n(PI, \u00a7\u00a7244\u20136). While perfect souls have\ndirect access to the (intelligible) immaterial lights (PI,\n\u00a7250), the survival of human imagination would be required for\nthe experiencing of divine retribution and the perfecting of imperfect\nsouls in the afterlife. \n\nThe spheres of Ether and Zamharir, both situated below the sphere of\nthe Moon and associated with the world of elements, are identified as\npossible spiritual/\u2018pneumatic\u2019 substrata for the\nposthumous activities of the imaginative faculties of those souls\n(Suh. 1993c, 245); although, it has been suggested that it could\n\u201csimply be read as one of the celestial bodies, Moon, Mercury,\nVenus, and so on\u201d (van Lit 2017, 47). Suhrawardi postulates the\nexistence of this independent eschatological realm with the assistance\nof which sensitive perceptions can occur in the form of imaginable\nrepresentations (PI, \u00a7244\u20138; Suh. 1992a, 90;\nMarcotte 2011; cf. Kutubi 2015, 93\u20136). Suhrawardi\u2019s\n\u2018world of images\u2019 provides a solution to Avicenna\u2019s\nattempt to explain posthumous felicity of souls in the Hereafter, in\nthe form of posthumous \u2018imaginable\u2019 experience of\npleasures and pains (see section 4.3) and to explain the ethics\neschatology nexus (see section 5). \n\nFinally, while Suhrawardi denies metempsychosis in his Peripatetic\nworks (namely Flashes of Light and Intimations), he\nwould seems more sympathetic to the idea in the Philosophy of\nIllumination. In this work, he reviews arguments for and against\nmetempsychosis that remain inconclusive, such that he does not appear\nto reject completely the possibility of some kind of transmigration of\nsouls (cf. Plotinus\u2019 Enneads), especially for imperfect\n(miserable) souls. However, some commentators, like Shahrazuri, were\nof the opinion that he upheld metempsychosis (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7229\u201345; Schmidtke 1999; Walbridge 2017,\n271\u201373). \n3.2 Epistemology\n\nAt the heart of Suhrawardi\u2019s epistemological concerns lie two\nimportant components of his ishraqi philosophy of lights: the\nconcepts of \u2018self-awareness\u2019 (shu\u2018ur\nbi-l-dhat) and \u2018knowledge by presence\u2019\n(\u2018ilm huduri) (PI, \u00a7\u00a7114\u20137).\nWhat is at stake is the nature of the acquisition of knowledge and its\nontological underpinning. He begins by exploring and questioning some\nof the issues raised by the hypothetical thought experiment of the\n\u2018flying\u2019 or \u2018suspended\u2019 person found in\nAvicenna\u2019s Discussions and his Notes on\nAristotle\u2019s De anima, and his treatments of the soul in\nthe Cure and Salvation. In Intimations, for\ninstance, he criticizes and then rejects Avicenna\u2019s Peripatetic\n\u2018representational\u2019 epistemology that conceives acquisition\nof knowledge by means of a \u2018representation\u2019 or a\n\u2018form\u2019 of what is known in the knower (Kaukua 2015,\n106\u201317). He rejects it as a proof for the existence of the\nimmaterial soul, claiming that the relation enjoyed by the (material)\nbody/(immaterial) soul is a \u201cmore intimate relationship of\n\u2018presence\u2019 (hudur)\u201d, since\n\u2018presence\u2019 now connects (immaterial) intellection and\ninternal (material/brain) senses activities. This experiential\nevidence would serve as proof for the existence of the soul\n\nIn his Philosophy of Illumination, he deals primarily with\n\u2018apperception\u2019 (which now replaces representation or\nform). He analyzes the notions of apperception and self-awareness as\nhe explores this pre-logical mode of perception distinct from\nintellection. He discusses the primary awareness of the soul\u2019s\nexistence, its self-identity, the unmediated character of this\nparticular type of knowledge and issues of individuation. He develops\nhis epistemological theory by providing various arguments to\ndemonstrate the existence of a type of knowledge that is self-evident,\ninnate and unmediated through any type of abstraction or\nrepresentation of forms, whether it be through an image, a form, a\nnotion or an attribute of the self (Marcotte 2006).\n\nThe perception of pain becomes paradigmatic of the type of\napperception or awareness he envisions when discussion self- awareness\nas unmediated perception, i.e., a non-discursive, non-conceptual and\nnon-propositional type of knowledge that, nonetheless, constitutes a\nmode of knowing distinct from discursive knowledge. Similar to pain,\nself-awareness provides yet another illustration of this type of\nepistemic process. In this manner, Suhrawardi is able to explain the\nknowledge of both an individual self-awareness of its self and the\nawareness of other external objects of knowledge. The unmediated\nnature of this process characterizes both the soul\u2019s\nself-awareness and the soul\u2019s awareness or knowledge of external\nobjects of knowledge, such as dominating (intelligible)\nlight-entities, and even provides the conditions for possible glimpses\nof the Light of Lights, God, it may catch (Suh. 1993a, 72\u20133,\n487\u20139; cf. Kaukua 2015, 130\u20131). \n\nThe concept of self-awareness informs the epistemological and\nontological aspects of Suhrawardi\u2019s metaphysic of lights.\nBuilding upon a basic type of self-awareness found in Avicenna (but\nwithout its inference to the substantiality of the human soul) and the\nselfhood (of the contemplative soul) of the Arabic Plotinus,\nSuhrawardi introduces a pre-cognitive level of self-consciousness or\nself-awareness, logically prior to any distinction between subject and\nobject (Kaukua 2011, 141\u20134). Self-awareness of human beings is\nequated with the self-awareness that incorporeal lights possess and\nshare. Suhrawardi writes, \u201cIt has been shown that your ego\n(ana\u2019iyya) is an incorporeal light, that it is\nself-conscious, and that the incorporeal lights do not differ in their\nrealities. Thus, all the incorporeal lights must apprehend their own\nessences (dhat), since that which is necessarily true of a\nthing must also be true of that which has the same reality\u201d\n(PI, \u00a7127; cf. Kaukua 2011, 150). He thus distinguishes\nthe \u2018object of cognition\u2019 from the \u2018subject\u2019,\nthe latter embodied in the \u2018I-ness\u2019\n(ana\u2019iyya) coined by Suhrawardi to identify the\n\u201cmode of being proper to a cognitive subject\u201d;\nself-awareness, as mere apprehension and existence, is now\ndistinguished from the awareness of separate objects (Kaukua 2015,\n113; Marcotte 2006). \n\nIt is upon self-awareness that Suhrawardi builds his\n\u201crevisionist concept of knowledge as presence\u201d (Kaukua\n2015, 125\u201342). In his Intimations, the\n\u2018Plotinian\u2019 (cf. Enneads V 3.6) Aristotle figure\nof Suhrawardi\u2019s famous \u2018dream-vision \u2018 provides an\nillustrious example of what constitutes real knowledge based on\nimmediate and intuitive knowledge: \u201creturn to your self\n(nafs)\u201d (1993a, 70), that is, knowledge one obtains\nthrough one\u2019s own soul. This Aristotle continues to explain how\none knows, introducing intellection as \u201cthe presence\n(hudur) of a thing for a self (dhat)\u201d,\npresence (hudur) or appearance (zuhur) being a\n\u201cfunction of luminosity\u201d. These passages of\nIntimations introduce central elements of Suhrawardi\u2019s\nknowledge by presence (Suh. 1993a, 71\u20134; cf. Walbridge 2000,\n225\u20139; Eichner 2001, 127\u201340; Kaukua 2013, 310\u20137,\n2015, 127\u201333; Fanaei Eshkevari, 1996). \n\nIn Suhrawardi\u2019s \u2018science of lights\u2019, the object of\napperception \u2014 light \u2014 cannot be known discursively, but\nonly through an immediate presence or awareness of its luminosity, as\nnot to fall into reification. Mystical vision and contemplation\noperate through this intuitive process of knowing metaphysical lights.\nIndividuals achieve such states through spiritual and ascetic\npractices that enable them to detach themselves from the darknesses of\nthe world in their quest for the apperception of those lights.\nIntuitive knowledge (dhawq) thus constitutes a superior means\nof accessing the luminous reality and the divine realm of metaphysical\ntruths. \n\nSuhrawardi appears to spiritualize Avicenna\u2019s Peripatetic\nepistemology with a notably Platonic reading, now that the access to\nthe ultimate reality is guaranteed through divine photic illumination.\nHis classification of learned men according to their respective merits\nin discursive (philosophy) and intuitive (mystical) knowledge is\nrevealing. For some, like Qutb al-Din Shirazi, whereas the\nPeripatetics had extolled intellection, Suhrawardi brings direct\nintuition (dhawq) or mystical contemplation (heightened by\nascetic components) to the forefront, as an alternative \u2014 albeit\nmore reliable \u2014 foundation of certainty, where this presence can\nbe achieved through intuitive apprehension or contemplative vision\n(mushahada) in order to access true reality, following\ncontinuous practice of spiritual exercises. \n\nDirect intuition (dhawq) or mystical contemplation plays a\npredominant role, even for prophets. Prophetic knowledge relies on the\nfunctions of the faculty of imagination, i.e., its mimetic function\nand its role in the particularization of universal truths. Prophecy\nbecomes the \u2018direct\u2019 experience of the world of lights.\nSuhrawardi also introduces an independent \u2018world of\nimages\u2019 to account for the ability of prophets and other gifted\nindividuals to access divine metaphysical realms where imaginable\nforms already exist. Such individuals are either commissioned or\nuncommissioned to receive and transmit God\u2019s message, the\nprophets being those who are among the privileged commissioned. Direct\nintuition lies at the heart of Suhrawardi\u2019s prophetology,\ninasmuch as only the most perfect sage (hakim) with intuitive\nphilosophy (muta\u2019allih) who witnesses those truths,\nwhether he be a prophet or not, deserves God\u2019s viceregency\n(khilafa), by being either a living proof or in occultation.\nIndividuals who have access to those metaphysical lights can be\ninvested with this viceregency, depending on the degree of their\nreceptivity and the purity of their hearts (PI, \u00a75).\n\n\nOn the whole, however, the epistemic process by which mystics such as\nAbu Yazid al-Bistami (d.874), Sahl al-Tustari (d.896) and Hallaj\n(d.912), sages such as Zarathustra and Empedocles, philosophers such\nas Pythagoras and Plato, or Suhrawardi himself have all had access to\nthose metaphysical truths and divine realms remains quite similar to\nthe process by which prophets have accessed the same divine and\nmetaphysical truths. Liberated from the enslavement of the material\nworld, their Isfahbad-light souls become receptive to illumination and\nperceive truths similar to those perceived by prophets. Prophetic and\nmystical knowledge only occur once the human soul is able to conjoin\nwith those metaphysical lights. The soul is able to acquire a luminous\nand theurgic power, mediated by the active imagination which\nexistentiates images and forms that have been reflected, in a\nmirror-like manner, onto it (Sinai 2015). It can imitate and reproduce\nforms that it has received from non-sensible realms, as it\nshort-circuits all incoming external and sensible data. The faculty of\nactive imagination then projects those matters onto the \u2018common\nsense\u2019 that provides a sensible form to those divine\nmetaphysical realities that they did not originally possess. \n4. Metaphysics\n\nIn the Philosophy of Illumination, Suhrawardi develops a\ncomplex metaphysic of \u2018divine\u2019 lights. Light, the lynchpin\nof his metaphysics, structures his ontology and cosmology at the heart\nof which lies a spectrum of light and darkness that shapes the whole\nof reality. In his Intimations (Suh. 1993a, 2\u20133),\nphilosophy is divided into theoretical and practical components, where\nthe tripartite division of the practical encompasses the standard\nperitatetic disciplines of ethics (khuluqiyya), economics\n(manziliyya) and politics (madaniyya), while the\ntheoretical is concerned with immaterial realities, the highest\ntheoretical component being concerned with absolute being\n(wujud). \n4.1 Essence and Existence\n\nSuhraward\u2019s concept of light manages to \u2018disrupt\u2019\nthe classical Peripatetic ontology by rendering obsolete the Avicennan\ndistinction between \u2018essence\u2019 and \u2018existence\u2019\nin contingent beings (Rizvi 2000). Perhaps following Aristotle,\nAvicenna favored the primacy of essence over existence, the latter\nbeing considered an abstract concept. Suhrawardi criticized and\nrejected the Peripatetic logical distinction between the two concepts,\ninsisting that the concept of existence is added to quiddity in\nre, such that the general extension of the concept of existence\nremains a mental predicate, not a real one. Concepts such as being,\nthingness, etc. that Peripatetics considered a priori and\nreal are, for Suhrawardi, \u2018beings of reason\u2019\n(i\u2018tibar \u2018aqli), i.e. \u201cmerely mental\nconsiderations (i\u2018tibari) with no corresponding\nreality\u201d (Rizvi 1999, 222; PI, \u00a768, 56; Suh.\n1993a, 175\u20136). This is what some have labeled Suhrawardi\u2019s\n\u2018conceptualist\u2019 position, essence and existence being\ndistinct only in the mind, and his \u2018anti-realist\u2019 approach\nto existence, a notion predicated only of concepts in the mind\n(Benevich 2017, 206, 251), a possible later Nasir al-Din al-Tusi\ninspired reading. \n\nThe primacy of light signals a shift in the understanding of the very\nnature of the \u2018essence\u2019 of things. The respective degree\nor intensity of light of essences makes them distinct from one\nanother, although they all share in the same light whose origin\nremains with the Light of Lights. Everything partakes in and\nof light, in an almost infinite manner. The distinction\nbetween essence and existence no longer becomes appropriate to assert\ncontingency and only remains notional, since the difference between\nnecessary and contingent beings depends now on whether a being\npossesses light in itself or light for other than\nitself (Rizvi 1999, 223; PI, \u00a768). In the\nPhilosophy of Illumination (\u00a7121), Suhrawardi writes,\n\u201cLight is divided into light of itself and in itself and light\nof itself but in another. You know that accidental light is light in\nanother. Thus, it is not a light in itself although it is a\nlight of itself\u201d. \n\nRizvi (1999, 224) showed how later philosophers ascribed the\nontological primacy of essence (or quiddity) thesis to Suhrawardi who\n\u201cclearly states that quiddity/essence in itself is a conceptual\nand unreal a notion as existence\u201d, Suhrawardi noting that\n\u201cthe quiddity of luminosity [i.e., the same as light] is a\nmental universal\u201d (PI, \u00a7141). But it is also true\nthat Suhrawardi\u2019s \u201cphenomenological epistemology of\neidetic vision\u201d could easily imply a primacy of essence\n(Rizvi 1999, 224). The position is eminently nominalist, now that both\nexistence and essence are considered mere mental concepts, reality\nhaving been redefined with the new primacy of light. Likewise, his\ntheory of knowledge by presence remains \u201cdeeply nominalist and\nempiricist\u201d (viz. mystical experience) (Walbridge 2000, 169).\nHowever, light and essence cannot be synonymous. Both light and\ndarkness exist: \u201clight is the being of things as their\ninstantiating principle in concreto and not their\nessences\u201d (ibid.). Likewise, light is not identical\nwith substance, since both dark substances and accidental lights exist\n(Walbridge 2000, 24). Rizvi (1999, 224) notes that entities grasped as\nessences through presential knowledge are \u201capparent aspects of\nwhat one might regard as \u2018light monads\u2019\u201d, an idea\nwhose source appears to be highly Platonic or Neoplatonic (Proclus).\n\n\nFor Suhrawardi (PI, \u00a7\u00a7111\u20133), being is\ngrasped through the (non-sensible) vision of lights that lie beyond\nthe essences, as even the existence of bodies depends upon incorporeal\nlights: \u201cNothing that has an essence (dhat) of which it\nis not unconscious is dusky, for its essence is evident\n(zuhur) to it. It cannot be a dark state (hay\u2019a\nzulmaniyya) in something else, since even the luminous state\n(hay\u2019a nuriyya) is not a self-subsistent light (nur\nli-dhati-ha), let alone the dark state. Therefore, it is\nnonspatial pure incorporeal (nur mahd) light\u201d\n(PI, \u00a7114). Access to this ultimate reality of beings is\nachieved through the direct experience of its ontic light reality,\nrendering intuitive and non-discursive knowledge (logically) prior to\nany other type of knowledge. \n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s criticism of the essence-existence distinction had\nan impact on later discussions, namely those of Ibn Kammuna (d.1284)\n(Eichner 2010), Athir al-Din al-Abhari (d.ca.1265) and al-Katibi\nal-Qazwini (d.ca.1276) (Eichner 2012). Later, Mulla Sadra (d.1636)\nnotes Suhrawardi\u2019s confusion between the concept of existence\nand the reality of existence and replaces his notion of light with the\nnotion of being, blending Avicenna\u2019s ontology of contingency\nwith his ishraqi hierarchy of lights (Rizvi 1999, 225). \n4.2 Ontology of Lights\n\nIn the second part of the Philosophy of Illumination,\nSuhrawardi lays out his light ontology. While some parallels can be\ndrawn with the mystical light epistemology of Muhammad al-Ghazali\n(d.1111) in his Niche of Lights (1998) (cf. PI,\n\u00a7171; Sinai 2016), Suhrawardi develops a distinctly original\ntheory of light. Light and its manifestation are fundamental\nontological principles of his complex metaphysics wherein the\ncontinuous irradiation from the Light of Lights creates and sustains\nthe unity of reality. \n\nThe nature of light, its various manifestations and their\ninterconnectedness determine what exists. All existing things can are\ndivided into four classes of existents (from which Suhrawardi\u2019s\ncosmology is derived). The first category of entities consists of\nself-subsistent \u2018pure\u2019 or \u2018immaterial lights\u2019\nthat are strikingly similar to Leibniz\u2019s\nmonads (Walbridge 2005: 244), those that are associated with the\nPeripatetic intellects. These lights manifest to themselves are aware\nof both themselves and what is other than them. These are causally\nprimary, in terms of existence and of efficiency, though they\n\u201ccan differ in intensity and in luminous and dark\naccidents\u201d (aspects of their individuation). In addition, they\nare now endowed with the capacity to create and to be \u201cmanifest\nto other immaterial lights\u201d. The second category consists of\n\u2018dark barriers\u2019, bodies whose existence depends on\naccidental light to make them manifest (as \u201cthe effects of\nlights\u201d) and that are \u201cknown only by incorporeal\nlights\u201d. The third category consists of \u2018accidental\nlights\u2019, inhering in another, such as physical lights, and the\n\u201cluminous accidents\u201d occurring \u201cin both barriers and\nin immaterial lights\u201d. The last category consists of \u2018dark\naccidents\u2019, the \u201cqualities of physical things that are not\nmanifest in themselves\u201d, but inhering in another (Walbridge\n1992, 49\u201351, 2004, 213\u20134; PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7107\u201313, 121). Thus, what distinguishes quiddities is\nthe degree of their luminous intensity within the ontological\nhierarchies or \u2018grades\u2019 (more or less) of light, from the\nnoblest of light, the Light of Lights (God) to the absence of it\n(matter). \n\nSuhrawardi adopts a familiar \u2018pyramidal structure of levels of\nlight being\u2019, from the Light of lights to the sublunary world.\nHe appeals to two (Peripatetic) principles to uphold the existence of\na first necessary cause \u2014 the Light of Lights \u2014 and all\nthe basic classes of beings (light and darkness, substance and state,\nindependent and dependent beings). A first principle, Walbridge notes,\n\u201cis a form of the principle of sufficient reason, \u2018the\nprinciple of the most noble contingency\u2019 [\u2026] which\nasserts that nothing can exist without a cause of higher ontological\nlevel\u201d (PI, \u00a7\u00a7164\u201373; cf. Paths and\nHavens for Aristotle\u2019s views in On the Heavens;\nSuh. 1993a, 434\u20135). This first principle of \u2018nobler\ncontingency\u2019 (imkan ashraf), central for\nSuhrawardi\u2019s demonstration of the existence of a Light of Light\nthat is ontologically discinct from, though partaking in the\ncontingent of which it is the first cause. A second principle\ncorresponds to the Aristotelian \u201cimpossibility of an ordered,\nactual infinity\u201d which, with the first principle, guarantees\nthat \u201cthere cannot be an infinite number of levels of being and\nthat there must be one being whose existence is necessary in itself\n\u2014 Avicenna\u2019s \u2018Necessary of Existence\u2019\n(wajib al-wujud)\u201d \u2014 and for Suhrawardi, the Light\nof Lights (Walbridge 2000, 24\u20135, 1992, 56\u201361; PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7129\u201338, 55). Mayer (2001) showed that this second\nprinciple was certainly not central to Avicenna\u2019s\ncosmological/ontological argument of the existence of God. From the\nbeing of the One, the Light of Lights, can emanate all the existents\nand the cosmos via a complex interconnected irradiation of light\nintensity (PI, \u00a7150\u20134), varying light intensity\nbringing to life the different \u2018degrees\u2019 of contingent\nimmaterial and material beings, a monist-like ontology of lights that\naccommodates the contingency of all existents irradiated, but\ndistinct, from Light of Lights (cf. Rizvi, 2019, and 2009, ch.2). \n\nWhile light always remains in itself identical, its proximity or\ndistance from the Light of Lights determines the ontic light reality\nof all beings. Their ontological statuses, qualities and influences\nare determined by the different degrees of intensity of light. The\ndistinguishing characteristic is the scale of lights coming into being\nthrough the radiance of light: the greater its radiance, the greater\nits ontological perfection. Reality proceeds from the Light of Lights\nand unfolds via the First Light and all the subsequent dominating and\nmanaging lights whose exponential interactions bring about the\nexistence of all existents. As each new light interacts with other\nexisting lights, more light and dark substances are generated. Light\nproduces both immaterial and substantial lights, such as immaterial\nintellects (angels), human and animal souls. Light produces dusky\nsubstances, such as bodies. In fact, light generates both luminous\naccidents, such as those in immaterial lights, physical lights or\nrays, and dark accidents, whether it be in immaterial lights or in\nbodies (PI, \u00a7\u00a7109\u201310). \n\nAlong with the notion of varying degrees of intensity of light,\nSuhrawardi introduces two hierarchies of immaterial lights: a vertical\norder and a horizontal order. The first vertical order of lights\nproceeds from the Light of Lights. These are the pure and incorporeal\n(mujarrada) dominating (qahira) lights. From the\nLight of Lights proceeds an incorporeal First Light \u2014 following\nthe Neoplatonic principle ex uno non fit nisi unum, i.e.\n\u2018from the one, in so far as it is one, comes only one\u2019\n(principle at the heart of Avicenna\u2019s emanationist\n(fayd) cosmology, cf. Lizzini, 2016, sect. 5.4) \u2014 thus\nassuring ontological dependency of all that comes into existence upon\nthe Light of Lights. From this First Light proceeds a Second Light and\nthe all-encompassing barzakh (highest heaven); from the\nsecond proceeds a Third Light and a second barzakh, or the\nSphere of fixed stars; and so forth (PI, \u00a7141\u20133,\n151\u20132). This vertical order of incorporeal lights is further\ndivided into two classes: the loftier dominating lights \u2014 the\nAvicennan Peripatetic immaterial intellects \u2014 and the managing\n(mudabbira) lights \u2014 the Avicennan Peripatetic\nimmaterial souls of the spheres associated with the various bodies\n(barazikh), as well as the managing Isfahbad light that rules\nover human souls (PI, \u00a7155). Light operates at all\nlevels and hierarchies of reality: irradiation proceeds from higher\ndominating (qahira a\u2018la) lights, whereas the lower\nlights desire the higher ones (PI, \u00a7147). There is a\ncorrelative relation of dominance (qahr) and yearning or love\n(mahabba) between the higher incorporeal lights and the lower\naccidental lights (PI, \u00a7156). \n\nThis vertical hierarchy of lights mirrors the Avicennan Neoplatonic\nprocess of emanation of intellects. Suhrawardi, however, increases the\nnumber of active principles (the Peripatetics immaterial intellects,\nsomething Averroes denounced in Avicenna\u2019s Neoplatonic\nontology). Each of level of immaterial dominating lights is associated\nwith a celestial sphere. They are no longer limited to\nal-Farabi\u2019s (d.950) nine spheres or to those and their\n\u201cvarying number of subordinate spherical bodies\u201d Avicenna\nsuggested with his \u201csecond kinematic model\u201d (Janos 2011,\n172\u20139). This development may have inspired Suhrawardi\u2019s\nindefinite, though not infinite, number of immaterial dominating\n(qahira) lights that are more \u201cthan ten, or twenty, or\none hundred, or [\u2026], or a hundred thousand\u201d, lights that\nare, in fact, as numerous as the stars in the fixed heavens\n(PI, \u00a7151; Arslan 2014, 138\u20139). \n\nThe vertical hierarchy of immaterial dominating lights interacts with\na second horizontal order of dominating lights. Some are equal to\nothers, \u201cbecause the higher lights possess many luminous aspects\nor interact with each other, the existence of other equal dominating\nlights may occur from them [\u2026]. Thus, among the dominating\nlights are mother-lights (ummahat) \u2014 the fundamental\nvertical lights with few and substantial intermediaries \u2014 while\nother are lights horizontal in their ranks from intermediate\nrays\u201d (PI, \u00a7183, 154\u20135). This second\nhorizontal hierarchy of dominating (qawahir) lights is, at\ntimes, associated with \u2018managing angels\u2019 (PI,\n\u00a7248, 259, 269\u201370) (perhaps equal in number to celestial\nbodies; at times, referring to ancient Semitic angelic hierarchies and\nZoroastrian mythology). \n\nBut more importantly, some of the horizontal self-subsisting and\nincorporeal dominating lights are identified as formal dominating\nlights, as \u2018Lords of Species\u2019 (archetypes) or\n\u2018idols\u2019 (arbab al-asnam): \u201cthough they are\nnot imprinted in the barriers (bodies), they occur from each master of\nan idol in its barrier shadow with respect to some exalted luminous\naspect\u201d (PI, 155). These are, at times, labelled the\nPlatonic Forms (muthul Aflatun) (located perhaps at the lower\nthreshold of the world of souls), which Suhrawardi incorporates into\nhis metaphysics, over which rules the Light of Lights (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7246\u20138; Suh. 1999, 111). Each of those eternal,\nunchanging and pure luminous lights can differ in kind without\ndiffering in ontological level. They are \u201clights of equal\nstrength\u201d that \u201cdiffer from others of the same strength by\nluminous and dark accidents\u201d, some of the lights of this\nhorizontal order being \u201cthe efficient, not the formal, causes of\nnatural kinds\u201d (Walbridge 2017, 270; Suh. 1993a, 67\u20138;\nPI, \u00a7\u00a794\u20135, 164\u201371). The function of\nthose Platonic Forms is analogous to the archetypal Forms of Plato,\nbut only in so far as they govern various species whose exemplars they\nexistentiate (rather than being mere universals), such as the species\nof bodies that move the celestial spheres and being the cosmological\nefficient causes of all sublunar matters, including human souls\n(Walbridge 1992, 61\u20136, 2017, 270\u20131). \n\nOut of the interaction of the irradiations of the vertical and the\nhorizontal lights, the bodies of the lower world are generated. These\ntwo hierarchies of lights are structurally interrelated through the\nprinciple domination (qahr) that the higher lights have over\nthe lower ones and the principle of desire and love (mahabba)\nthat the lower lights have for the higher lights (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7152\u20136). The increase of dominating immaterial lights\nand the introduction of a second order of horizontal lights (the\nPlatonic Forms) enabled the possibility of simple effects from\ncomposite causes (PI, \u00a7\u00a794\u20135). The two\ndimensional hierarchy of lights introduces a new nonlinear and\ncomposite notion of metaphysical causation. The multiplication of\nmetaphysical entities increases the ontological distance that exists\nbetween the Light of Lights and the sublunar world, while\nsimultaneously providing a greater holistic view of reality, since\nlight lies at its core. Notions of intensity and gradation of light,\ntogether with notions of presence and self-manifestation, are thus\ncentral to Suhrawardi\u2019s metaphysics. The intensity of light\ncorresponds to the degree of the lights self-awareness. Similarly, the\nself-awareness of the Light of Lights encompasses, with varying\ndegrees of intensity, all the other constitutive lights of reality.\nLater, Mulla Sadra (d.1636) will take up Suhrawardi\u2019s insight\nabout the gradation and intensity of light and develop an ontology\ngrounded in the gradation of existence (rather than light) of all\nbeings, somehow reversing Suhrawardi\u2019s ontology with his primacy\nof existence and his understanding of essence as a mental concept.\n\n\nWith his metaphysic of lights, Suhrawardi proposes what he may have\ndeemed a more satisfying argument for the difficult philosophical and\ntheological problem of God\u2019s knowledge of particulars. The\nconcepts of self-knowledge and knowledge by presence, at the heart of\nthe knowledge by presence of all light-beings, provides a means to\nexplain God\u2019s self-awareness, as the Light of Lights, as well as\nIts self-knowledge and It\u2019s knowledge of all things other than\nitself (creation), such as particulars. Knowledge by presence serves\nto explain the presence of God\u2019s knowledge of Itself to Itself,\nas it does for the self-knowledge of all beings of light: \u201cIts\nknowledge of Its essence is Its being a light in Its essence and\nevident to Its essence\u201d. At the same time, God is able to be\naware of what is other than It, such that \u201cIts knowledge of\nthings is their being evident to It, either in themselves or in their\nconnections\u201d (PI, \u00a7162). Hence, God\u2019s\nknowledge by presence is now conceived in terms of the\n\u201cexistence of a \u2018relation\u2019 (idafa) between\nit and whatever is known to it\u201d, whereby this \u201cpurely\nrelational\u201d nature of God\u2019s knowledge enables the Light of\nLight to know material particulars without there being any changes or\neffects on its light substance (Sinai 2013, 320\u20131, 2016,\n288\u201393; Eichner 2001, 137\u20139). For a good overview of\nSuhrawardi\u2019s light ontology, see Walbridge (1992, 40\u201378,\n2004, 212\u20136). \n4.3 World of Images\n\nAbout half a century earlier than Ibn \u2018Arabi (d.1240),\nSuhrawardi introduces an independent \u2018world of images\u2019\n\u2013 what Corbin labelled the mundus imaginalis, a fourth\nontological level (later rejected by Mulla Sadra, see Landolt 2017).\nVan Lit (2017, 7) prefers the translation \u2018world of\nimages\u2019 (or \u2019imaginable world\u2019) over Corbin\u2019s\n\u2018imaginal world\u2019 to render Suhrawardi\u2019s concept of\n\u2018 alam al-mithal. This fourth world lies alongside the\nthree worlds (i) of the intelligible or of the dominating\n(qahira) lights, (ii) of the spiritual, i.e. a soul\nassociated with a body, either human or celestial, or the managing\n(mudabbira) lights, and (iii) of the material or the\n\u2018barriers\u2019 (barzakhiyan) (PI,\n\u00a7246). This independent \u2018world of immaterial shapes\u2019\n(ashbah murajjada) or images (suwar) operates like\nan \u2018isthmus\u2019 or an \u2018intermediary realm\u2019 of\n\u201cdark and illuminated suspended images (suwar\nmu\u2018allaqa)\u201d. It lies somewhere between the physical\nworld of darkness and the world of the \u2018Lords of the\nspecies\u2019 (arbab al-anwa\u2018), i.e. the world of the\nPlatonic Forms of \u2018pure Lights\u2019 (horizontal lights). This\nfourth \u2018world of images\u2019 is where new entities \u2013 the\n\u2018suspended forms\u2019 (muthul mu\u2018allaqa)\n\u2013 exist and which post-mortem souls grasp with their\nimagination. Suhrawardi actually expands on Avicenna\u2019s\nsuggestion that imagination has an important eschatological function\nto explain the fate of souls in the Afterlife (cf. van Lit, 2017,\n20\u201347). \n\nWith the introduction of this \u2018world of images\u2019 ,\nSuhrawardi sought to account for entities that possess an existence of\ntheir own (some, prior to their coming into existence in this world).\nThe \u2018world of images\u2019 contains \u2018suspended\nforms\u2019 that are not embedded in matter, this world being\nconceived as a plane of \u201cghosts, of the forms in mirrors,\ndreams, and worlds of wonder beyond our own\u201d which light can\nexistentiate (Walbridge 2000, 26). The \u2018world of images\u2019\nprovides the material for mystical visions and the miraculous. \n\nIt is where those \u201cwho have attained an intermediate bliss and\nthe ascetics [\u2026] may escape\u201d, a place where they\n\u201ccan and do bring images into beings\u201d, where\neschatological forms and images will be existentiated for the souls of\nthe deceased so that they may continue to perfect their souls, where\n\u201call the promises of prophecies find their reality through\nit\u201d (PI, \u00a7\u00a7244\u20138), as well as where\nelements not fitting conveniently into the Aristotelian scheme of\nforms in matter are found. \n\nThe world of \u2018suspended images\u2019 is distinct from the Forms\nof Plato (muthul Aflatun) that are \u201care luminous, while\nsome of the suspended forms are dark and others illuminated\u201d\n(PI, \u00a7246). The \u2018world of images\u2019 is where\nimages and suspended forms are found that are perceived by the\nsoul\u2019s imaginative power (PI, \u00a7225). Suhrawardi\nnotes, \u201cWhoever sees that station knows with certainty the\nexistence of a world other than that of barriers (barazikh;\ni.e. bodies). In it are self-subsistent [lit.: suspended] images\n(muthul mu\u2018allaqa)\u201d (PI, \u00a7259),\nalthough those suspended forms \u201care in neither a place nor a\nlocus\u201d (PI, \u00a7225; see van Lit 2017). More\nimportantly, Suhrawardi\u2019s \u2018world of images\u2019 and\nsuspended forms plays a novel eschatological function, ensuring that\nimperfect souls may experience posthumously the pains and pleasures of\ndivine retribution by providing an \u2018objective\u2019 status to\nthose \u2018real\u2019 experiences. (PI, \u00a7\u00a7\n244\u20136; Sinai 2015, 280\u20131; van Lit 2017, 37\u201378) (see\n3.1). Suhrawardi did not conceptualize systematically his \u2018world\nof images\u2019 and \u2018suspended forms\u2019. Hence, from the\nthirteen century up to the twenty-first century, quite a few\ncommentators have delved deeper into the matter (van Lit 2017,\n142\u201375). \n5. Politics and Ethics\n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Philosophy of Illumination carries a\npolitical dimension. Ziai (1992) provides an overview of what he calls\nhis \u2018Illuminationist political doctrine\u2019: it establishes a\nconnection between political authority, just rule, and the\nruler\u2019s access to divine light. For instance, in Tablets to\n\u2018Imad (Suh. 1993c, 186\u20138 [Pers.]), Suhrawardi\nintroduces two Zoroastrian terms kharrah (xwarrah)\nand farrah (Avesta/Pahlavi) to allude to the divine/regal\nlight that was bestowed upon ancient kings; in the Book of\nRadiance, it is the Light of Lights that bestows upon them\nluminous glory and power (kharra-yi kayani) (Suh. 1998,\n84\u20135, cf. 1993c, 81; Gnoli 1999); and in the Philosophy of\nIllumination, it corresponds to the light of the Kingdom of Power\n(malakut) that Kay Khusraw and Zarathustra were able to\nbehold (PI, \u00a7\u00a7165\u20136; cf. 1993a, 502\u20135).\n\n\nThis political \u2018doctrines\u2019 provides indications of the\nconditions able to guarantee the reign of the just rule, thus\nproviding elements of an Illuminationist political ethic of the\nSage-ruler. However, the general framework of the ethics underlying\nSuhrawardi\u2019s ishraqi system requires further\ninvestigation. His particularly Platonic understanding of the mystic\nqua ruler and his political role, coupled with the role of intuitive\nor \u2018mystical\u2019 access to the \u2018divine\u2019 lights by\nprophets, mystics and sages might, however, not leave Suhrawardi\nimmune to the same criticism Popper leveled against Plato. \n\nSuhrawardi may, in fact, appeal to a somewhat\n\u2018mythological\u2019 genealogy of the transmission of ancient\nIllumination/ishraqi philosophies from the Greek/West and the\nIranian/East which he claims to revive. Ziai (1992, 337; cf. Walbridge\n2000, 201\u201310) speculates that he tried to put into practice the\npolitical dimension (i.e. a \u2018new\u2019 political doctrine) of\nhis ishraqi philosophy, based mainly on passages from his\nworks and considering the possible circumstances of his demise and\nexecution. Historical data supporting the thesis, Suhrawardi\u2019s\nrelationship with his many patrons and the purpose of passages\nrelating to these Illuminationist political doctrines need further\nexamination to confirm the claim (Marcotte 2001a, 415\u20136). \n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s eschatology \u2014 the Return \u2014 and his\ndiscussions on the fate of the soul in the afterlife offers a glimpse\nof what might constitute a \u2018good\u2019 and ethical life in this\nworld. In line with Avicenna\u2019s classification of souls in the\nhereafter according to their worldly acquisition of practical and\ntheoretical knowledge, the moral qualities developed in this life\ndetermine the fate of souls in the afterlife (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7244\u20138). In search of felicity, souls must attempt to\ndetach themselves from their tenebrous bodies and all that is worldly\nand material and seek to access the world of immaterial lights. Souls\nengrossed in matter in this life partially determine their fate in the\nafterlife. In this respect, Suhrawardi does not depart greatly from\nAvicenna\u2019s Peripatetic eschatology (see 4.3). \n\nProphets, saints and exceptionally gifted mystics are the ones best\nable to achieve conjunction with the world of pure lights. Ascetic\npractices in this life can become a means to attain self-consciousness\nof the ontic light reality of the soul. Some of Suhrawardi\u2019s\nallegorical and mystical treatises, like The Treatise of the\nBird, A Tale of Occidental Exile or A Day with a\nGroup of Sufis (Suh. 1993b, 274\u201397, 1999b, 2001, 1976),\nprovide examples of the pedagogical role and instruction of the guide\nfigure, of the Lord of the human species, or of spiritual entities to\nthe novice in his or her quest for the immaterial world of lights in\nwhich salvation lies. The posthumous life of individual souls and\ntheir ability to perceive the promised other-worldly rewards and\npunishments become conditions for divine retribution. \n6. Suhrawardi\u2019s Legacy\n6.1 Post-Suhrawardian Traditions\n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s tragic end marked the beginning of a long history\nof commentaries by both proponents and detractors of his novel\nreassessment of the Avicennan Peripatetic tradition. By the end of the\n13th century, at least two of his works were readily\navailable and studied in the major centers of learning of Syria\n(Damascus and Aleppo), Iraq (Baghdad) and Iran (Maraghah), some of\nwhich circulating most probably before his death. Two major trends\nwithin the commentarial tradition of the 13th century were\nto shape later developments: one wass exemplified by Ibn Kammuna\n(d.1284) who emphasizes the \u201cpurely discursive and the more\nsystematically philosophical\u201d aspects of Suhrawardi\u2019s\nworks, and the other was exemplified by Shahrazuri (d.ca.1288) who\nfocuses on, and expands the symbolic and the allegorical aspects of\nwhat came to be known as the ishraqi tradition (Ziai 2003,\n473\u201387). \n\nIbn Kammuna, a Jewish philosopher greatly influenced by both Avicenna\nand Suhrawardi, is the first commentator (Langermann 2005,\n297\u2013301; Pourjavady and Schmidtke 2006, 23\u201332; Eichner\n2010) who, while in Baghdad, completes in 1268 his commentary on the\nlogic, physics and the metaphysics of Intimations (Ibn\nKammuna 2003, 2009). Having resided in Aleppo, he could well be, with\nsuch works as The Revealer, completed in 1278 (2008;\nLangermann 2005), the link between Suhrawardi and Shahrazuri who\nwrites the earliest commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (ca. 1286), after having written a commentary on\nIntimations (Shahrazuri 1993; cf. Marcotte 2002).\nShahrazuri\u2019s encyclopedic Metaphysical Tree, also\nwritten before his commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (Shahrazuri, 2004 and 2005 [a better edition]),\nwould contain some ishraqi elements, although it remains to\nbe ascertained whether his Divine Symbols and Proverbs does\n(Privot\n 2004).[2]\n\nMore work is needed to determine the extent and the nature of\nShahrazuri\u2019s contribution to what came to be known as an\n\u2018Illuminationist\u2019 tradition. Van Lit (2017, 79\u2013112)\nprovides a good example of how focussing on a particular doctrinal\nelement can yield much insight into Shahrazuri\u2019s contribution,\nnamely giving expression and stabalising the name of the \u2018world\nof images\u2019, its location and topography, the means to access it,\nits reality, etc. (see also Marcotte 2001b, 2002). In 1295, Qutb\nal-Din Shirazi completes his own commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (Shirazi 2001; Suh. 1986), which supplanted\nShahrazuri\u2019s commentary (Walbridge 1992). \n\nAuthors that incorporated or commented and discussed isharaqi\nideas include (Isma\u2018il ibn) Muhammad Ibn Rizi (fl.ca.1280), in\nhis Life of Souls (Marcotte 2004); Athir al-Din al-Abhari\n(d.1242) in a number of his works (Eichner 2012); \u2018Allamah Hilli\n(d.1325), who pens a commentary on the Philosophy of\nIllumination (now lost), and solutions to issues raised in\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Intimations (completed before 1293) and\nOpposites; Sayyid Sharif al-Jurjani (d.1414) writes a\ncommentary on the Philosophy of Illumination (Kadivar 2011,\n290\u20132); Ibn Abi Jumhur Ahsa\u2019i (d.1501) (Schmidtke 2000);\nNajm al-Din Mahmud al-Nayrizi (d.ca.1526), a critic of Suhrawardi,\ncompletes in 1526 his commentary on Tablets to \u2018Imad\n(Pourjavady 2011, 131\u20136, 137\u201352); the two theologians\nJalal al-Din al-Dawani (d.1501) and Ghiyath al-Din al-Dashtaki\n(d.1542) write commentaries on his Temples of Light (Dawani\n1953; Dashtaki 2003; Suh. 1996); and \u2018Abd al-Razzaq (Fayyaz)\nLahiji (d.1667), one of Mulla Sadra\u2019s students, would have also\nwritten a commentary on Temples of Light. \n\nMulla Sadra (Sadr al-Din al-Shirazi) (d.1636), who was most interested\nin Suhrawardi\u2019s critique of Avicennan Peripateticism (existence\nas a being of reason, the Platonic forms, knowledge by presence,\neschatology), writes marginal glosses on the Philosophy of\nIllumination and on Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi\u2019s commentary on\nthe work (Mulla Sadra 2010; cf. Suh. 1986; Landolt 2017). Mulla Sadra,\nlike Hadi Sabzawari (d.1873), upholds the principality of existence\n(wujud), in opposition to what he understood to be\nSuhrawardi\u2019s view that quiddity was primary over existence, a\nview shared by Mir Damad (d.1631) (cf. his Spiritual\nAttractions [2001] and Divine Embers [2001]). \n\nDuring the same period, Suhrawardi\u2019s works enter the Turkish\nOttoman and Persian Indian philosophical traditions. In the Ottoman\nworld, Isma\u2018il Ankaravi (d.1631), a member of the Mevlevi Sufi\norder, translates and comments Temples of Light in his\nElucidation of Wisdoms (Kuspinar 1996). During the\n17th century, the enigmatic Ahmad Ibn al-Harawi (probably\nfrom Herat), who lived in the Indian subcontinent, translates the\nPhilosophy of Illumination into Persian on which he writes a\ncommentary (Harawi 1979). Azar Kayvan (d.ca.1615), a Zoroastrian high\npriest from Fars, who emigrated to Gujurat in Mughal India during the\nreign of Emperor Akbar (r.1556\u20131605), starts a Zoroastrian\nishraqi school (Walbridge 2001, 91\u20133). Muhammad\n\u2018Ali Hazin Lahiji (d.1667) writes a commentary on\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Words of Sufism (Suh. 2001, 101\u201339;\n1993d), along with glosses and notes on three other of his works,\nincluding the Philosophy of Illumination (Kadivar 2011,\n290\u20132). Even thinkers of the 20th century, such as\nMuhammad Kazim \u2018Assar (d.1975) and his discussion of\n\u201cequivocal being\u201d, have been influenced by\nishraqielements (Ziai 2003, 472). Van Lit provides a\nchronological sketch of eighteen commentators on Suhrawardi, including\nlesser-known ones (2018, 548\u201353). Cataloguing and making\naccessible hundreds of philosophical works in Arabic and Persian from\nthe 12th\u201319th century, like the recent\npublication of the Persian Inner Light (2012) of Shihab\nal-Din Kumijani (d.1895), are bound to shed new light on\nSuhrawardi\u2019s legacy. \n\nAlthough very little has been written on the history of the\nphilosophical legacy of Suhrawardi\u2019s novel ishraqi\nideas and doctrines, how is one to understand claims made about the\nexistence of a truly original and distinct \u2018Illuminationist\ntradition\u2019? Some are more cautious in their assessment of\nSuhrawardi\u2019s project and legacy. Van Lit (2017, 2\u20133,\n6\u20137), for example, questions Corbin and others who have deemed\nwhat is often labelled the \u2018Illuminationist\u2019 or\nisraqi tradition a \u2018school of thought\u2019, and offer\na corrective assessment with his detailed study on the notion of\n\u2013 suspended images \u2013 and the \u2018world of image\u2019.\nLandolt (2008, 235) also nuanced such claims, like those of Ziai\namongst others, regarding the existence of a truly Suhrawardian\n\u2018Illuninationist\u2019 tradition conceived as a philosohpical\n(hikma) system radically different from Avicenna\u2019s\nPeripateticism. Suhrawardi\u2019s project needs to be recast as a\ncritique of the latter\u2019s brand of Peripateticism, similar to the\nvarious critiques put forward by Shahrastani (d.1153), Abu al-Barakat\nal-Baghdadi (d.ca.1165), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d.1210) and\nal-Ghazali(d.1111), etc. \n6.2 Historiography\n\nTwo main schools of thought dominate the historiography of the\nIlluminationist tradition. The first, more prevalent and older school,\nviews Suhrawardi as the founder of a mystical, or\n\u2018theosophical\u2019 tradition. Henry Corbin, the father of\ncontemporary Suhrawardiana studies, introduced this paradigm\n(Gutas 2002, 16\u20139). \n\nHis interest in the Shaykh al-ishraq rested primarily with\nthe latter\u2019s hikmat al-ishraq, Corbin\u2019s\n\u2018Oriental theosophy\u2019 \u2014 the lost mythological\ntraditions of the Ancient sages of the West and the East \u2014\nSuhrawardi was reviving, also with his Persian allegories, (views\nshared by Nasr). Interested mainly in his mystical views and\nmetaphysics of light and irradiation, he saw little interest in\nediting Suhrawardi\u2019s works on logic and physics. These\n\u2018gnostic\u2019/\u2018mystic\u2019,\n\u2018esoteric\u2019/\u2018theosophical\u2019 wisdom, or even\npre-Aristotelian philosophia perennis or universalis\n(Nasr 1964, 60\u20133) approaches to Suhrawardi\u2019s works often\noveremphasize the mystical and the theosophical at the expense of the\nphilosophical, and thus blur the distinction between philosophy,\ntheology and mysticism (cf. Pourjavady 2013). Proponents of this\napproach highlight Suhrawardi\u2019s aim to expound on\nAvicenna\u2019s incomplete project to develop an\n\u2018Eastern\u2019 (mashriqiyya) (not\n\u2018illuminative\u2019) philosophy of Khurasan, in spite of the\nfact that Avicenna\u2019s \u2018Eastern\u2019 philosophy was not a\nmystical enterprise; rather, it aimed at developing a philosophical\ntradition distinct from the \u2018Western\u2019 philosophical school\nof Baghdad (Gutas 2000). Many scholars often overlook the fact that\nSuhrawardi\u2019s major works are largely devoted to technical\nphilosophical questions and theories of which even his allegorical or\nminor works are not devoid. More generally, the proponents of the\nmystical approach interpret Suhrawardi\u2019s ishraqiviews\nas a break or a departure from the philosophical tradition. Some, like\nFakhry (1982), go so far as to question the originality of the\nisharqi elements of his work, deeming it a mere transposition\nof Avicennan philosophy into a light terminology. \n\nThe second, more recent school, views the novel elements of\nSuhrawardi\u2019s ishraqi system as an original\nphilosophical \u2018critique\u2019 \u2014 in the wake of the\nreassessments of Abu al-Barakat al-Baghdadi, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and\nal-Ghazali \u2014 a reconfiguration of Avicennan Peripateticism, an\ninterpretation adopted by a great many of his medieval commentators.\nSome contemporary commentators, like Izutsu (1971), explore the\nanalytical aspect of Suhrawardi\u2019s work; others, like Mehdi\nHa\u2019iri Yazdi (1992) and Jalal al-Din Ashtiyani, propose\n\u2018Neo-Avicennan\u2019 interpretations of the ishraqi\ntradition (Amin Razavi 2013, xvii\u2013xix). Ziai (1990) focuses\nprimarily on his logic; whereas Walbridge (1992) studied, first, the\nwork of Qutb al-Din Shirazi (d.1311), and then the philosophical\nheritage of Ancient sages and wisdoms (Greeks, Stoic, Platonic, etc.;\npre-Socratics; Persians, etc.) of Suhrawardi\u2019s ishraqi\nsystem (2000, 2001, etc.). \n\nWhile some, like Corbin (1971), Nasr (1964) and Mohammad Mo\u2019in\n(1948, 1950), view Suhrawardi as the reviver of some ancient form of\nPersian philosophy; some, like Shahab Ahmed (d. 2015) have\noveremphasized his role within the Islamic\n East[3];\n still others are more skeptical. For example, Ziai (2003, 484) notes\nthe absence of an independent textual Persian philosophical tradition,\nalthough he believes that the Islamic ishraqi philosophical\ntradition incorporated \u201cMazdayasnian sentiments kept alive in\npopular and oral traditions and in poetic, epic and mystical\ncompositions\u201d. Gutas (2003) also notes the lack of any textual\nevidence to support claims that Suhrawardi attempted to revive ancient\nWestern Greek, Gnostic, and Hermetic traditions and suggests focusing\nresearch on the reasons why Suhrawardi appeals to the authority of the\n\u2018Ancients\u2019, East and West, rather than trying to find\n\u2018real\u2019 historical filiations to sources to which he\nmight have had access. \n\nSince the 1990s, interest in Suhrawardi\u2019s work and\nishraqi philosophical system and its reception was rekindled\n(Ziai 1990; Walbridge 1992, 2000, 2001; Amin Razavi 2004). However,\nalthough some recent scholarship has focused on his critique of\nAvicennan Peripatetic views, as well as explored a number of more\nspecific logical, physical, psychological, epistemological,\nontological, and metaphysical issues of Suhrawardi\u2019s major\nArabic works, further studies is still needed to add to our knowledge\nof the influence of Avicenna\u2019s major works (Cure,\nPointers and Reminders, even Discussions),\nas well as the influence of the Arabic Platonic and Neoplatonic\ntraditions in the form they would have been available to him. Eichner\n(2011, 140) suggests any \u201cinterpretation of Suhrawardian texts\nmust avoid simply assuming that they were rendered correctly by later\ninterpretations, which sought to present a unified and coherent\naccount of his system and the relation of that system to\nPeripateticism\u201d. This methodological principle would help\nrevisit Suhrawardi\u2019s work, and to produce much-needed studies on\nthe works of authors who belonged to, or were influenced by various\nand novel ishraqi elements (cf. Gheissari et al.\n2018), to chart the complex historical and philosophical developments\nof what was to become known as a novel \u2018Illuminationist\u2019\ntradition. This would undoubtedly provide new insights into his\ndistinctly Platonic reworking of Avicennan Peripateticism, what Gutas\n(2002) has identified as Suhrawardi\u2019s \u2018Illuminationist\nAvicennism\u2019.\n",
