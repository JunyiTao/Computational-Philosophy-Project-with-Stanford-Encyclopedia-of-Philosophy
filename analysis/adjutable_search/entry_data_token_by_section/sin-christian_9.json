    "main_text": "Sin as State || Just Penalty\n4.4 Just Penalty\n\nClosely connected with the concept of constitutional fault is the idea\nof just punishment for that fault. According to those views which\nreject original guilt, we are justly punished only for our actual\nsinful actions and dispositions. For those views which affirm original\nguilt, a question arises concerning where this guilt comes from, given\nthat it doesn\u2019t seem that the post-Adam person in question\ncommitted the sin to which the original guilt attaches. There are two\nmain families of views that seek to address this issue: federalism and\nrealism. According to federalism, which is sometimes also referred to\nas representationalism, we are held to be guilty for original sin and\nfor our constitutional fault in virtue of Adam (or Adam and Eve) being\nour \u201cfederal\u201d or \u201crepresentative\u201d head. In\nshort,\n\n\nwe are condemned because Adam stood in for us as the representative of\nthe whole human race; due to his relationship to us as our\n\u201cfederal head\u201d or \u201clegally appointed\nrepresentative\u201d, his guilt thus counts as our guilt. (McCall\n2019: 162)\n\n\nFederalism involves a \u201ctreating as if\u201d, or a \u201clegal\nfiction\u201d, where guilt is imputed via taking Adam to be a\nrepresentative of the human race (see Madueme 2020; for a criticism of\nsuch imputation, see Crisp 2009).\n\nIn contrast, realism holds that there is a real unity between all who\nare justly punished for original guilt and Adam (or, again, Adam and\nEve). As Augustine puts it,\n\n\nThe first human beings \u2026 having become the first sinners, were\nthen punished by death in such a way that whatsoever sprang from their\nstock should also be subject to the same penalty. For nothing could be\nborn of them which was not what they themselves had been \u2026so\nthat what arose as a punishment in the first human beings who sinned\nalso follows as a natural consequence in the rest who are born of\nthem. (Augustine City of God, XIII.iii)\n\n\nBecause of our common human nature, all humans have an organic unity\nin virtue of which the punishment for original sin is just (for a\ndiscussion and criticism, see Crisp 2020b). However, Augustine\n\u201cnever really explains how all did exist and act in Adam,\nleaving the matter rather mysterious\u201d (Couenhoven 2013: 27).\n\nThe realist view perhaps best known is that of Jonathan Edwards, who\nheld that all humans are one simply because as God declares us to\nbe:\n\n\nthere is no identity or oneness [that does not] depend on the\narbitrary constitution of the Creator.\u2026 Divine\nconstitution [God\u2019s treating all humans as one entity] is\nthe thing which makes truth. (Edwards 1758: part 4, ch. III\n[1970: 404])\n\n\nInfluenced by Jonathan Edwards, a number of philosophers have\nsuggested that the theory of perdurantism might provide a basis for\nrealism. (See the discussions in Wainwright 1988, Wyma 2004, Crisp\n2005 and 2009, Rea 2007, and Hudson 2014.)\n",
