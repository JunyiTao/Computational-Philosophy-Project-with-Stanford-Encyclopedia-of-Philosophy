    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Causation\n3.1 Causation\n\nOn the standard picture that almost all classical Indian philosophers\nwork with, the relata of the causal relation are not just\nevents, but are rather things (which may include\nevents). When a lumberjack chops down a tree with his axe, the relata\nof the relevant causal relation are not the event of the\ntree\u2019s falling (i.e., the effect) and the event of the\nlumberjack hitting the tree with his axe. Rather, the causal relation\nholds between the event of the tree\u2019s falling (i.e.,\nthe effect) and a set of distinct entities, e.g., the axe, the\nlumberjack who wields the axe, the contact between the tree and the\naxe, etc. Call these causally relevant factors the causal\nconditions (k\u0101ra\u1e47a) for the falling of the\ntree.\n\nIn the fourth chapter of The Sweets of Refutation,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a argues that the notion of a causal condition\ncannot be defined. This section takes a closer look at\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a\u2019s arguments against one definition of\ncausal conditions offered originally by Udayana in his Flower\nOfferings of Reason (Ny\u0101yakusum\u0101\u00f1jali)\nunder verses 1.13 and 1.19.\n\n\ncausation=invariable conjunction A causal\ncondition relevant to the production of an effect e is an\nentity that invariably (niyatatvena) precedes\ne.\n\n\n\nAs \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a notes (KKh 710), this definition can be\nfleshed out in at least two ways, depending on how we understand the\nexpression \u2018invariably.\u2019 Here is the first\ninterpretation.\n\n\ncausation=invariable conjunction i A\ncausal condition relevant to the production of an effect e is an\nentity c which is unconditionally\n(anaup\u0101dhikatvena) present before e is\nproduced.\n\n\n\nAn effect e is unconditionally preceded by a condition\nc if and only if there is no third condition c* such\nthat c is present only when c* is also present, but,\nsometimes e is produced without c* being present before it. In\nother words, a condition e is unconditionally preceded\nby a condition c if and only if whenever e is produced,\nc is present before\n it.[19]\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a argues that this proposal falls prey to what\nwe may call the problem of spurious correlations. Take a\nscenario where an entity c and an effect e share a\ncommon cause, e.g., the first unclear symptoms of a disease and the\nlater more pronounced symptoms of it. Here, there is a common cause\nfor both sets of symptoms: the disease itself (or perhaps, the\nconditions that produce the disease). The first set of symptoms\naccompanies the second set unconditionally. There is no third\ncondition c* such that the first set of symptoms are produced\nonly if c* is present, but c* is sometimes absent from\ncases where the second set of symptoms is present. This makes the\nconnection between the two sets of symptoms unconditional, but that\ndoesn\u2019t make the first set of symptoms causally relevant to the\nsecond.\n\nThe other interpretation of causation=invariable\nconjunction cashes out the expression \u2018invariably\u2019\nusing modal vocabulary. \n\n\ncausation=invariable conjunction ii A\ncausal condition relevant to the production of an effect e is\nan entity c which is necessarily\n(ava\u015byambh\u0101vitvena) present before e is\n produced.[20]\n\n\n\nAccording to \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a, this definition doesn\u2019t\nwork because it suffers from the problem of irrelevance (even\nthough the problem also seems to arise for the previous proposal). It\nwould predict that even intuitively causally irrelevant\nfactors which are necessarily present before the production of an\neffect are causally relevant to the production of that\neffect. For instance, it predicts that just as the threads that\nconstitute a cloth are causally relevant to the production of the\ncloth, so also is the color of those threads causally relevant to the\nproduction of the cloth, when it intuitively isn\u2019t.\n\nIn order to care of problems of this kind, one might modify this\nproposal in the following manner (KKh 705).\n\n\ncausation=invariable conjunction ii* A\ncausal condition relevant to the production of an effect e is\nan entity c which is necessarily and\nnon-superfluously (ananyath\u0101siddhatvena)\npresent before e is produced.\n\n\n\nA proposal of this kind was possibly first defended by\n\u015aa\u015badhara (fl. 1125 CE), and became popular amongst later\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\n philosophers.[21]\nNon-superfluity (ananyath\u0101siddhi) is defined\nas the property of not being established otherwise, i.e.,\nindependently of the effect (k\u0101ry\u0101d\nanyaprak\u0101re\u1e47a na siddhi\u1e25). causation=invariable\nconjunction ii* is supposed to\ntake care of the problem of irrelevance. The general thought\nis that factors that are intuitively causally irrelevant to an effect\nare established not on the basis of the effect, but on the basis of\nsomething else. For example, the color of the threads is established\non the basis of the threads themselves, and therefore established\nindependently of the effect.\n\nBut this move won\u2019t work (KKh 705\u2013706). There are two\nsalient ways of interpreting the definition of non-superfluity,\ndepending on how we understand the notion of\n\u201cestablishing\u201d (siddhi). According to the first,\na non-superfluous condition is one which isn\u2019t brought\nabout independently of the effect (k\u0101ry\u0101d\nanyaprak\u0101re\u1e47a na ni\u1e63patti\u1e25). But clearly a\ncausal condition isn\u2019t brought about by the effect; rather, it\nis the causal factor that contributes to the production of the effect!\nAccording to the second interpretation, a non-superfluous condition is\none which isn\u2019t cognized independently of the effect\n(k\u0101ry\u0101d anyaprak\u0101re\u1e47a na\nj\u00f1apti\u1e25). But if this is correct, then our\ndefinition of causal relevance should predict that we always become\naware of causal conditions on the basis of their effects. That\u2019s\njust not true. Sometimes, we infer the existence of rain-bearing\nclouds on the basis of rain, but at other times, we know it simply by\nlooking up at the sky. Setting aside these interpretations, one might\nclaim that a condition that is non-superfluous with respect to an\neffect is one which isn\u2019t brought about or known in any way\nother than as a causal condition relevant to that effect. But\nthen the definition would be circular; for, now, in trying to define\nthe notion of a causal condition, we are appealing back to that very\nnotion.\n\nAs in the case of knowledge, \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a is eventually\nled to consider the question of whether we should treat the property\nof causal relevance (k\u0101ra\u1e47atva) as primitive.\nCould we define a causal condition as just that which possesses the\nproperty of causal relevance? \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a says that this\nwould only be a reasonable strategy if there were some independent\nreason for thinking that there is such a property. But neither\nperception nor inference gives us any reason to believe this. Here,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a addresses an argument\u2014offered by\nUdayana in The Flower Offering of Reason\n(Ny\u0101yakusum\u0101\u00f1jali) 1.5\u2014for the claim\nthat the existence of causal conditions can be established by a form\nof inference. Udayana\u2019s main premise is that any putative effect\nis an occasional (k\u0101d\u0101citka) entity, i.e., an\nentity that only arises at certain times and not at others. In order\nto explain this occasionality, we need to posit a causal condition\nthat brings the putative effect into existence. If that were not the\ncase, then the production of the putative effect\u2014its coming into\nexistence (bhavana)\u2014wouldn\u2019t depend on anything;\nthen, it would be produced all the time (Up\u0101dhy\u0101ya &\n\u015a\u0101stri 1957: 51).\n\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a offers two responses to this simple, yet\npowerful, argument. The first response takes issue with the notion of\nexplanation that Udayana invokes in his argument (KKh 715\u2013716).\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a subscribes to the following principle.\n\n\n principle of explanation If a property\nX explains a property Y, then X and Y must\nbe properties of the same entity.\n\n\n\nThe intuitive motivation for this principle seems to be that we cannot\nexplain the property Y possessed by an entity e by\nappealing to a property X possessed by a completely distinct\nentity. For instance, in order to explain Devadatta\u2019s obesity,\nwe shouldn\u2019t appeal to the gluttony of some person other than\nDevadatta, but rather to Devadatta\u2019s own overconsumption of\nfood. But Udayana is essentially trying to explain the occasionality\nof a putative effect by appealing to the property of causal\nrelevance that something else possesses. This violates the principle\nof explanation.\n\nNow, one might attempt to resolve this problem by pointing out that\njust as putative effects are occasional entities, i.e., they appear\nnow and then, so also are all their causal conditions occasional\nentities. So, causal relevance and occasionality can indeed be\nproperties of the same entity. Thus, there is no violation of the\nprinciple of explanation.\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a shows that this leads to an infinite regress\nof explanations. To explain the occasionality of a putative effect, we\nappeal to another occasional entity, namely its causal condition. But\nthen in order to explain the occasionality of this causal condition,\nwe would have appeal to yet another causal condition, thus launching\nus on an explanatory regress.\n\nHowever, the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosopher might bite\nthe bullet on this challenge. She might say that not all cases of\nexplanatory regress are bad, so there is no harm in positing a\nbeginningless chain of causes and effects. In response,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a is happy to grant that not all explanatory\nregresses are vicious. But if an explanatory regress involving\noccasionality and causal relevance is to get off the ground, we would\nhave to cite at least one case where the occasionality of a putative\neffect e is in fact explained by the causal relevance of a\ndistinct entity c. The Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nphilosopher is yet to show that; in fact, she is appealing to the\ninfinite explanatory regress in order to establish that claim.\n\nMoreover, even if one denies the principle of\nexplanation, there is second, much shorter, response to\nUdayana\u2019s argument. In Udayana\u2019s argument, the\noccasionality of the putative effect is the explanandum, while the\ncausal relevance of the causal condition is the explanans.\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a asks whether there is a relation between\nthese two properties. If there is no relation, the explanandum could\nindeed obtain without the explanans. In that case, the explanation\nwouldn\u2019t really work. If there is a relation,\n\u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a could offer another regress argument that\napplies to relations in general. The thought is this. Suppose there\nare two entities a and b such that whenever b\noccurs, a also occurs. So, there must be a relation R\nbetween a and b that explains this pattern of\nco-occurrence. The question is this: How is R related to\na and b? If we say that there is no further relation\nR* by which a or b is related to R, then,\nagain, we would be unable to explain the correlation between a\nand b. If we acknowledge that there is such a relation, we\ncould ask again how a or b is related to R*.\nThus, an infinite regress will be unavoidable.\n",
