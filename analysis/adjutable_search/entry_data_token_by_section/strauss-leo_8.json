    "main_text": "Strauss\u2019s Moral Argument for Revelation\n9. Strauss\u2019s Moral Argument for Revelation\n\nStrauss argues, both in his early work on medieval Jewish rationalism\nand in his mature American work, that only revelation, and not\nphilosophy, can provide the basis of a universal morality. To be sure,\nthis universal morality is based on faith and not certain knowledge.\nNevertheless, it does underscore a moral weakness in the philosophical\nposition. Nowhere does Strauss highlight this point more than in his\nseminal 1943 essay on the medieval Jewish thinker Judah Halevi. This\nessay became an integral part of Persecution and the Art of\nWriting and far from an obscure relic of an interest in things\nJewish and medieval, Strauss\u2019s reference to this essay forms a\ndecisive part of his argument in Natural Right and\nHistory.\n\nStrauss\u2019s reading of Halevi centers on the question of what\nHalevi, in his Kuzari, could have meant by the \u201claw of\nreason.\u201d Through a detailed analysis of the Halevi\u2019s\nKuzari, Strauss concludes, \u201cthe iura naturalia\nare really not more than the indispensable and unchangeable minimum of\nmorality required for the bare existence of any society.\u201d But as\nStrauss points out, the unchangeable minimum of morality is in fact,\nfrom a moral point of view, not very much after all. In explicating\nHalevi\u2019s position, Strauss elaborates on Halevi\u2019s comment\nin the Kuzari that \u201cEven a gang of robbers must have a\nkind of justice among them if their confederacy is to last,\u201d\n(the analogy refers to, without mentioning, Plato\u2019s parable of\nthe robbers in Republic, Book 1, 342b-d). Strauss writes:\n\nhe [the philosopher in Halevi\u2019s Kuzari] mentions among\nthe governmental laws of the Divine code the prohibition against\nmurder, e.g. while he does not mention it among the governmental and\nrational nomoi which are known independently of revelation; this again\nis easily understandable considering that the Bible prohibits murder\nabsolutely, whereas a gang of robbers, e.g., would merely have to\nprohibit the murder of other members of the gang. (PAW, p. 132)\n\n\nStrauss concludes his study of Halevi by suggesting that \u201cby\ngoing so far with the philosophers\u2026he [Halevi] discover[s] the\nfundamental weakness of the philosophic position and the deepest\nreason why philosophy is enormously dangerous\u201d (PAW, p. 140). On\nStrauss\u2019s reading of Halevi, philosophy leads to the dangerous\ndenial of an absolute morality that is not contingent upon allegiance\nto a specific group.\n\nIn Natural Right and History Strauss does not deny that we\ncan know right and wrong, but he does question strongly whether\nphilosophy in and of itself can defend a universal morality beyond\nthat of a closed city or society. Significantly, Strauss alludes to\nHalevi\u2019s analogy of a gang of robbers when he writes:\n\nBut it is unfortunate for the defenders of justice that it is also\nrequired for the preservation of a gang of robbers: the gang could not\nlast a single day if its members did not refrain from hurting one\nanother, if they did not help one another, or if each member did not\nsubordinate his own good to the good of the gang (NRH, p. 105).\n\n\nStrauss\u2019s allusion to Halevi is made all the stronger by a\nreference to his essay on Halevi in a note to the following sentence:\n\u201cThere exists an alternative medieval interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine [of natural right], namely, the Averroistic\nview or, more adequately stated, the view characteristic of the\nfal\u0101sia, as well as of the Jewish Aristotelians\u201d (NRH, p.\n158). The context of this comment and note is Strauss\u2019s\ndistinction between the Aristotelian view of natural right and the\nSocratic-Platonic view. For Aristotle, Strauss writes, \u201cthere is\nno fundamental disproportion between natural right and the\nrequirements of political society\u201d (NRH, p. 156). In contrast,\nStrauss maintains, the Platonic-Socratic view of natural right\nrecognizes a fundamental discrepancy between the justice of natural\nright, which is independent of law, and the justice of the city, which\nis of necessity dependent on law. The Platonic-Socratic view of\nnatural right points to the philosopher\u2019s lack of inner\nattachment to the laws of society.\n\nFor Strauss, the \u201cAverroistic view\u201d that is \u201can\nalternative medieval interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s\ndoctrine\u201d is based on the Islamic reception of Plato\u2019s\nLaws and hence is Platonic in a way that the Christian\nreading of Aristotle is not. Plato and the \u201cJewish\nAristotelians,\u201d Strauss insists, recognize a fundamental tension\nbetween philosophy and law, which is also the tension between\nphilosophy and \u201cthe city.\u201d As Strauss makes clear in\nNatural Right and History, it is the Christian interpretation\nof Aristotle, and particularly Thomas Aquinas\u2019 notion of natural\nlaw, that denies this tension: \u201cThe Thomistic doctrine of\nnatural right or, more generally expressed, of natural law is free\nfrom the hesitations and ambiguities which are characteristic of the\nteachings, not only of Plato and Cicero, but of Aristotle as\nwell\u2026. No doubt is left\u2026\u201d (NRH, p. 163). We have\nseen that for Strauss, leaving doubt behind is the intellectual error\nthat led to the theologico-political predicament of the early\ntwentieth-century, with ultimately terrible consequences for reason,\nmorality, and politics.\n\nBy repeatedly emphasizing his doubts about philosophy\u2019s ability\nto ground a universal morality, Strauss suggests that revelation\nremains and must remain a continual moral challenge for philosophy\n(see also JPCM; NRH, pp. 106\u2013107; PAW, p. 140). To be sure,\nStrauss\u2019s is not an argument for revelation. And\nStrauss himself was not a believer. But Strauss\u2019s arguments\nabout revelation do offer the believer intellectual resources with\nwhich to challenge the philosopher and for this reason Strauss is\nneither indifferent to nor does he reject revelation. As Strauss\nconcludes his essay on Halevi, \u201cOne has not to be naturally\npious, he has merely to have a passionate interest in genuine morality\nin order to long with all his heart for revelation: moral man as such\nis the potential believer\u201d (PAW, p. 140, emphasis added).\n\nOf course, revelation\u2019s challenge to philosophy is but a\nchallenge and never a victory. At the same time, philosophy always\nremains a challenge to revelation\u2019s ability to make claims about\nconclusive evidence for revelation\u2019s truth. This mutual\nchallenge is ultimately a form of moderation. \n\nWhile many scholars still see Strauss as clearly siding with Athens\n(Meier 2006; Velkley 2011; Lampert 2013), recent scholarship has\ncontinued to debate which side of the divide Strauss finds most\nconvincing.  Some argue that Strauss uncovers \u201cPlato as the\nfundamental philosophical ally of the standpoint of Jerusalem, which\nrejects the project of a philosophical or scientific foundation of\nethics in favor of its foundsion in divine revelation as law\u201d (Vatter,\np. 206).  Others contend that Strauss\u2019s \u201cengagement with\nJersualem is itself an aspect of philosophy as a contemplative way of\nlife\u201d (Bernstein, p. xxii).   And still others maintain that\nStrauss shared with Maimonides \u201cThe struggle to bring about a grerater\namount of harmony through a fertile tension [between philosophy and\nthe life of Torah], in individual human beings and thus in collective\nhuman affairs\u201d (Green 2013, p. 87). \n",
