Are there facts containing\nabstract objects and properties, for example the fact that 2 is a\nnumber? Is a fact which contains a concrete object, for example the\nfact that Sam is sad, itself concrete or abstract? Are there facts\nwhich are formally complex, for example negative or conditional facts?\nWhat is the relation between facts, on the one hand, and concrete\nevents, processes and states, on the other hand? Do objects stand in\nrelations because the objects and the relations they stand in\nare parts of facts? What are the identity conditions for facts? Are\nthere states of affairs which do not obtain? May such states of\naffairs contain non-existent objects? Are states of affairs abstract\nentities which exist necessarily? Do facts understood as\nexemplifications of properties come in two kinds\u2014the\ncontingently existing ones and the non-contingently existing ones?\n(For discussions of all these questions see the entry on\n states of affairs.)\n If concrete events, processes and states are identical with facts or\ncan be constructed out of facts, then it is plausible to think that\ncausality is a relation between facts. If they are not identical with\nfacts and cannot be constructed out of facts, then it is plausible to\nthink that causality is a relation between events and states and that\ncausality should not be identified with causal explanations. For\ndiscussions of the view that one or both of the relata of the causal\nrelation are facts, see Vendler 1967a,b; Menzies 1989; Mellor 1995;\nPersson 1997; and also the entry on\n the metaphysics of causation.\n\nThe assumption that facts contain objects, properties and\nrelations as proper parts may be criticised (Lowe 1998; Vallicella\n2000; K\u00fcnne 2003). One natural mereological principle is that the\nproper parts of the most basic kinds of whole belong to the same\ngeneral ontological category to which their wholes belong. Thus parts\nof things or substances are things or substances and parts of\nprocesses are processes. The view that the fact that Sam is sad\ncontains a substance and a property offends against this principle:\nsubstances and properties belong to different kinds and neither\nsubstances nor properties, it seems, are facts. Perhaps the natural\nmereological principle should be rejected in favor of the view that\nentities of any kind may come together to form a whole. But friends of\nfacts tend to think of facts as forming a very natural kind of whole.\nAnother possible view is that Sam is a fact rather than part of a fact\n(Armstrong 1997; Johansson 2004: 34; R\u00e9canati 2000; Bergmann\n1967).\n\nEven if facts or states of affairs do not contain objects\nsuch as substances or events, some may still be about, or\nconcern, such objects. This notion of aboutness has recently\nbeen assigned heavy metaphysical duties. Thus, Shamik Dasgupta (2014,\n2017) defines qualitative facts as facts which are not about\nany particular individuals, and argues that all the basic facts that\nconstitute the universe are qualitative, the individualistic (i.e.,\nnon-qualitative) facts being grounded in that qualitative basis (see\nbelow on grounding as a relation between facts). And Dan Marshall\nexploits the notion of factual aboutness for the purpose of theorizing\nabout intrinsicality. In his 2016a, he argues that a number\nof different notions of intrinsicality can be analysed in terms of the\nnotion of a state of affairs being intrinsically about\nsomething, and in his 2016b he defends a particular account of that\nsort.\n\nOne ontological role for states of affairs and facts is to be the\nprimary bearers of modality. Suppose that facts are obtaining states\nof affairs. Then we may distinguish the obtaining state of affairs\nthat Sam is sad from the obtaining states of affairs that Sam is\npossibly sad, that Sam is probably sad, and that Sam ought to be sad.\nHere the modal properties qualify the property of being sad and so\nqualify Sam. They are de re modalities. And, so the view\ngoes, the place of such modal properties is in states of affairs. (A\nstate of affairs is, as the German terms\n\u201cSachverhalt\u201d,\n\u201cSachverh\u00e4ltnis\u201d suggest, a relation between\nthings, the way things stand with respect to one another,\n\u201cwie die Sachen sich zueinander verhalten\u201d.) A\nfurther claim is that some de dicto modalities properly\nqualify states of affairs: the state of affairs that Sam is sad\nprobably obtains/possibly obtains/ought to obtain. Suppose that a fact\nis just the exemplification of properties. Then we may distinguish the\nfact that Sam is a man and the fact that Sam is necessarily a man. But\na friend of facts like the last one then has to accept that not all\nfacts are formally simple.\n\nAnother possible ontological role for states of affairs and facts is\nto provide the terms for the tie of grounding or explanation. The fact\nthat there is an explosion explains the fact that Sam\u2019s head\nturns (causal explanation). The fact that Mary slapped Sam is\nexplained by the fact that Sam is a sexist (explanation of action by\nreference to an \u201cobjective\u201d reason; Dancy 2000). The fact\nthat Sam admires Mary is explained by the fact that she is charming\n(explanation of feeling by reference to an \u201cobjective\u201d\nreason). The fact that there is a one-one correlation between the\n\\(F\\)s and the \\(G\\)s is explained by the fact that the number of\n\\(F\\)s = the number of \\(G\\)s (non-causal, conceptual or essential\nexplanation). Sceptics about such claims ask what \u201cthe fact that\n\\(p\\) explains the fact that \\(q\\)\u201d adds to \u201c\\(q\\) because\n\\(p\\)\u201d. (See Correia & Schnieder 2012, Mulligan 2007,\nTrogdon 2013, and the entry on\n metaphysical grounding.)\n\nAppeal to facts has also been made in order to give a semantics for\ncounterfactuals (Kratzer 2002). A premise semantics for\ncounterfactual, Kratzer argues, relies on facts:\n\n\nin a premise semantics, a \u201cwould\u201d-counterfactual is true\nin a world \\(w\\) iff every way of adding as many facts of \\(w\\) to the\nantecedent as consistency allows reaches a point where the resulting\nset logically implies the consequent. On the other hand, a\n\u201cmight\u201d-counterfactual is true in a world \\(w\\) iff not\nevery way of adding as many facts of \\(w\\) to the antecedent as\nconsistency allows reaches a point where adding the consequent would\nresult in an inconsistent set.\n\n\nThose facts, she argues, have to be propositions, but they must be\nhighly specific, almost as specific as facts conceived of as\nparticulars (see\n section 1.3\n below).\n\nFinally, certain metaphysical disputes of the realism/anti-realism\ntype are sometimes characterized in terms of facts: in such a dispute,\nthe realist is said to countenance facts of a certain kind, whereas\nthe anti-realist is said to reject facts of that kind. The\ndisagreement between realists about tense (or A-theorists) and\nanti-realists about tense (or B-theorists), for instance, is sometimes\ntaken to boil down to a disagreement about the question whether there\nare tensed facts: the former answer \u2018Yes\u2019 while the latter\nsay \u2018No\u2019. (See, e.g., Mellor 1998, Fine 2005 and Correia\n& Rosenkranz 2011.)\n\nOne difficulty faced by such characterizations is that of making clear\nwhat the relevant facts are supposed to be. The difficulty is\nparticularly acute in certain debates, for instance in the debate over\ntense realism. For what is it for a fact to be tensed? It cannot\nsimply be said that a tensed fact is a fact that can be referred to by\nmeans of a tensed description of type \u201cthe fact that\n\\(p\\)\u201d, where \u201c\\(p\\)\u201d is a tensed sentence. For it\nis open to a B-theorist to hold that such expressions do refer to\n(tenseless) facts\u2014e.g., that \u201cthe fact that Sam is\nlying\u201d refers, at any time \\(t\\), to a fact which can also be\nreferred to (at any time) using the description \u201cthe fact that\nSam is lying at \\(t\\)\u201d. Another suggestion is that a fact is\ntensed if and only if it is transient, i.e., sometimes obtains and\nsometimes fails to obtain. Yet, it may be replied, even if the\nproposed characterization does capture some tensed facts, it leaves\naside a number of other such facts, e.g., those which can be referred\nto by \u201cthe fact that Sam is currently sitting or not currently\nsitting\u201d and (barring certain forms of indeterminism) \u201cthe\nfact that if Sam is currently sitting, then it was the case yesterday\nthat Sam would be sitting one day hence\u201d, respectively.\n",
