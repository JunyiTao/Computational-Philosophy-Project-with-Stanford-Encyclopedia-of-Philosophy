    "main_text": "Conceptual Themes in Feminist Philosophy of Biology || Pluralism\n4.4 Pluralism\n\n\nThere is strong support for several aspects of pluralism in feminist\nphilosophy of biology. This pluralism arises out of attention to\nthe complexity and heterogeneity of biological phenomena and the\ndifferent social and epistemic contexts in which research is\nconducted. It tends to focus on the multitude of ways that\nobjects and categories can be constructed and the differences among the\npartial perspectives of biologists who are differently situated (for\nexample those taking a feminist as opposed to a non-feminist\nperspective on their research) (Haraway 1988). This can result in\na willingness to see multiple explanations for the same phenomena as a\nvirtue that arises from attending to these ontological and/or epistemic\npossibilities (Longino 2002, Fehr 2004). For example, feminists\nhave critiqued \u201cman-the-hunter\u201d theories of human evolution\nbecause they focus on a single cause, hunting, of a complex and varied\nevolutionary history (Bleier 1984). They point out that while\nhunting played a role, gathering was likely the primary source of\nnutrition, and that the reciprocal interaction of many factors, such as\nthe development of language and culture, likely played important roles\nin the evolution of human beings. \n\n\nFeminists have also been critical of tendencies to view nature in\nterms of sexualized dichotomies. This is evidenced in Anne\nFausto-Sterling's research on sexuality and intersexed\nindividuals (2000). She shows that biology and medicine,\nliterally, surgically construct intersexed individuals to fit more\nclosely into either one gender or the other. Feminist\nphilosophers of biology have been particularly vigilant in pointing out\nthe problems with the association of sexual dichotomies with male\nactivity and female passivity. This is supported by analyses,\ndiscussed above, of how the narrative of the sleeping egg being\nawakened by the sperm distorted our understanding of\nfertilization. There has also been work along these\nlines in analyses of developmental biology in which it is assumed that\nembryos develop along a female path by default unless a gene of the Y\nchromosome switches on the male pattern of development (Gilbert and\nRader 2001, Richardson 2008). Finally, there is significant\nnon-feminist work on pluralism in the philosophy of biology (for\nexample Dupr\u00e9 1993, Kellert et al 2006, Fehr 2006).\n",
