    "main_text": "Inner Speech and Thought || Inner Speech and Thought Expression\n2.1 Inner Speech and Thought Expression\n\nLangland-Hassan & Vicente (2018b: 10) observe that the view that\ninner speech (at least often) expresses thoughts that are distinct\nfrom the inner speech episodes themselves coheres with some larger\ntheories about thought and language. If one is attracted to these\ntheories, then they may well also be attracted to the view that inner\nspeech merely expresses thought.\n\nFirst, there is a natural connection between the language of thought\nhypothesis, most closely associated with Jerry Fodor (1975), and the\nview that inner speech expresses thought. On the language of thought\nhypothesis, our thoughts do take place in a language, but not in a\nnatural language. Rather, our thoughts take place in a kind of mental\nlanguage, often referred to as \u201cMentalese\u201d. If the\nlanguage of thought hypothesis is true, then, insofar as inner speech\nis keyed to a natural language, it seems that inner speech can at most\nserve to express the thoughts which occur in the mental language.\n\nSecond, on Willem Levelt\u2019s influential theory about language\nproduction, speaking involves conveying a pre-existing\n\u201cmessage\u201d (1989: passim). The structure of this message is\nconceptual but not linguistic. Via several stages of processing,\nnatural language sentences (or sub-sentential items) are formulated\nwhich, once articulated, express the conceptually structured message\nwith which the process started. If one thinks that inner speech is\nactually a kind of speech, then one might incline to think that inner\nspeech also expresses a pre-existing message.\n\nThus, Peter Carruthers (2009, 2018) approaches matters from a Fodorian\nand Leveltian angle when he proposes that\n\n\nthe first metacognitive access subjects have to the fact that they\nhave a particular belief is via its verbal expression (whether overtly\nor in inner speech). (2009: 125)\n\n\nFor Carruthers, the inner speech episode is not a belief or judgment\nitself, but rather the expression thereof (see\n Section 5.2).\n In a similar way, Ray Jackendoff (1996, 2007, 2011, 2012) emphasizes\nthe distinction between thought itself and the auditory imagery by\nwhich it may be expressed, identifying only the latter with inner\nspeech (see\n Section 3.1).\n Likewise, Jos\u00e9 Luis Berm\u00fadez (2003) and Jesse Prinz\n(2011) distinguish between conceptual thought itself and inner speech,\nwhile holding that we often come to know what we are thinking by\nattending to inner speech sentences that we might use to express such\nthoughts. They stop short of explicitly claiming that such sentences\nactually express thoughts, however, specifying instead that the inner\nepisodes are sentences through which such thoughts \u201cmight be\nexpressed\u201d (Berm\u00fadez 2003: 164), or that we \u201cwould\nuse\u201d to express them (Prinz 2011: 186) (see\n Section 5.1).\n\nOne can, however, hold that inner speech episodes express thoughts\nwithout committing to the view that a thought must be fully-formed\nprior to the production of the relevant inner speech episode.\nJos\u00e9 Luis Berm\u00fadez (2018), for example, holds that\nproducing an inner speech episode can actually play a role in forming\nthe thought which it expresses. For Berm\u00fadez, a thought can be\nrefined and precisified as an external utterance is being produced\nand, equally, a thought can be refined and precisified while an inner\nspeech episode is being produced. Nonetheless, by the time an inner\nspeech episode has been produced, it will express an existing\nthought.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting the following point of contact between the\nactual speech view, discussed in\n Section 1,\n and the question of whether inner speech expresses thought. If it is\nan essential feature of speech that it serves to express thought, then\ndefenders of the actual speech view are likewise committed to the view\nthat inner speech expresses thought. If, on the other hand, one holds\nthat there can be (inner) speech that does not express thought, then\nthe question arises as to what the difference between (inner) speaking\nand thinking in a natural language might be\u2014and whether there is\nindeed a difference.\n",
