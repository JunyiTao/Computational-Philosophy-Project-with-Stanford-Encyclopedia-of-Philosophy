    "main_text": "Academic Skepticism || Later Academic Skepticism\n3.3 Later Academic Skepticism\n\nCarneades was an enigma to his students and immediate successors.\nClitomachus (head of the Academy from 127 to 110 BCE) seems to have\nattempted the impossible: to adhere closely to Carneades\u2019\nphilosophy, even though he never understood what Carneades truly meant\n(Levy 2010). The cornerstone of his adherence lies in the view that\nCarneades argues for suspension of judgment and against beliefs\nunderstood as Stoics understand them. Philo of Larissa, another\nstudent of Carneades, interprets his teacher as allowing for tentative\nbeliefs in the skeptic\u2019s life. With Philo, the skeptical era of\nPlato\u2019s Academy comes to an end. Philo\u2019s philosophy seems\nto divide into two phases. In Athens, and as head of the Academy, he\nstays relatively close to Carneades. Moving to Rome later in his\ncareer, he develops a markedly different position. He argues only\nnarrowly against the Stoic criterion and their conception of\ncognition. One can apprehend things and so come to know\nthem\u2014one just cannot apprehend them in the way in which the\nStoics construe cognition (PH 1.235). The fact that there is\nno apprehension in the sense of the Stoics does not mean that there is\nno knowledge (Acad. 2.14). This move shifts the discussion in\nseveral important ways. First, Philo can be interpreted as a kind of\nexternalist: one can know something without knowing that one knows it.\nAbsent Stoic cognitive impressions, we are not able to identify which\ninstances of \u2018holding-true\u2019 qualify as knowledge; but we\nnevertheless have some knowledge (Hankinson 2010). Second, this\nproposal is a step toward modern skepticism, which is not concerned\nwith criteria of truth, but with knowledge.\n\nCicero\u2019s skeptical philosophy in his own philosophical writings\nis again distinctively different. In line with his notions of what is\nprobable (probabile) or likely to be true (veri\nsimile), Cicero often examines a range of philosophical\npositions, aiming to find out which of them is most rationally\ndefensible. He thinks it is better for us to adopt a view that is\nlikely to be true, rather than remain unconvinced by either side\n(Thorsrud 2009, 84\u2013101). Cicero is of the greatest importance\nfor the transition between ancient and early modern skepticism. As in\nother fields of philosophy, Cicero\u2019s influence is partly the\ninfluence of the translator. In transposing philosophical ideas into\nthe language of a different culture, the ideas change. Cicero\nsometimes speaks of doubting, dubitari (e.g., Acad.\n2.27, 106; however, he often sticks with the earlier language of\nassent and suspension). But doubt has no place in Greek skepticism\n(see section 1).\n",
