    "main_text": "Prison Writings || The Theory of Intellectuals\n3.3 The Theory of Intellectuals\n\nIntellectuals formed a major theme of the Notebooks and\ndeveloped Gramsci\u2019s brief observations on the topic prior to his\narrest. Intellectuals, he noted,\n\n\nare the dominant group\u2019s \u201cdeputies\u201d exercising the\nsubaltern functions of social hegemony and political government. (SPN:\n12)\n\n\nAs such, they were key agents in the state\u2019s connection to civil\nsociety.\n\nTo understand their role in organizing consent, he argued, it was\nnecessary to expand the concept of intellectual. Rather than refer to\nacademics or artists, who work explicitly with ideas, the category\ncomprised all those whose social function was to communicate with, and\neducate, non-specialists (SPN: 9). Those undertaking the function of\nintellectuals included industrial technicians, managers,\nentrepreneurs, bureaucrats, and scientists. Gramsci distinguished\nbetween \u201corganic\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d types:\norganic intellectuals emerged from a specific social class and\nfunctioned to elaborate that class\u2019s productive activity as a\nset of general principles; traditional intellectuals, such as\nphilosophers or the clergy, were remnants of a former historical stage\nwho retained social prestige but no longer directly served a\nproductive class. Intellectuals were therefore rooted in material\nrelations of production but undertook the \u201ccritical\nelaboration\u201d of that activity into a \u201cnew and integral\nconception of the world\u201d (SPN: 9).\n\nThe construction of hegemony, Gramsci underlined, would require both\nthe elaboration of new organic intellectuals and the assimilation of\ntraditional intellectuals. He noted that his work with Ordine\nNuovo in Turin had already involved developing new forms of\n\u201cintellectualism\u201d among skilled workers who constituted,\nin his view, the organic intellectuals of a future communist society\n(SPN: 9\u201310). In his notes on \u201cAmericanism and\nFordism\u201d, he explored this theme in modern rationalized and\nmechanized production systems, still with little optimism that\nproletarian organic intellectuals were ready to promote a new\nworldview (SPN: 279\u2013318). Notably, Gramsci devoted considerable\nattention to an assessment of Croce, a traditional intellectual with\nan unparalleled \u201crole in Italian life\u201d (FSPN: 360),\ncomparable \u201cwith that of the Pope in the Catholic world\u201d\n(FSPN: 469; see also SPN: 94\u201395).\n",
