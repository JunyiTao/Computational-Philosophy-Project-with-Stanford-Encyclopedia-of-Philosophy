    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works\n1.2 Works\n\nThe dates of composition and even the number of Abelard\u2019s\nwritings remain largely obscure and a matter of controversy among\nscholars. One reason for this is that Abelard constantly revised and\nrewrote, so that several distinct versions of a given work might be in\ncirculation; another reason is that several of his writings might\nrepresent \u2018teaching notes\u2019 constantly evolving in courses\nand seminars. Hence it is not clear that \u2018date of\ncomposition\u2019 is a well-defined notion when applied to the body\nof Abelard\u2019s work that we now possess. Apart from\nAbelard\u2019s correspondence, which can be dated with relative\nprecision, Abelard\u2019s extant work falls into three\ncategories.\n\nThe first category consists of Abelard\u2019s works on\ndialectic\u2014works concerned with logic, philosophy of\nlanguage, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind. His two masterworks\nare:\n\nLogica \u2018ingredientibus\u2019,\n\u201cLogic\u201d (starting with the words \u2018To those\nbeginning\u2026\u2019).\nDialectica, \u201cDialectic.\u201d\n\n\nBoth of these works follow the pattern of the logica vetus,\nthe \u201cold logic\u201d inherited from antiquity: Porphyry\u2019s\nintroduction to Aristotle, the Isagoge; Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories and On Interpretation; Boethius\u2019s\nIntroduction to the Categorical Syllogism, Categorical\nSyllogisms, Hypothetical Syllogisms, On Topical\nDifference, and On Division. Abelard\u2019s works cover\nthe material presented in the old logic, though they do so in\ndifferent ways. His Logica\n\u2018ingredientibus\u2019 is a close textual commentary on\nthe old logic, though only some of it survives, namely the\ncommentaries on the Isagoge, the Categories, On\nInterpretation, and On Topical Differences; his\nDialectica is an independent treatise on dialectic that\ntreats the same material thematically, though neither the beginning\n(covering the Isagoge and the start of the\nCategories) nor the ending (on division and definition) have\nbeen preserved. In addition, there are four lesser works on\ndialectic:\n\nIntroductiones parvulorum, \u201cIntroductory\nLogic.\u201d\nLogica \u2018nostrorum petitioni\nsociorum\u2019, \u201cLogic\u201d (starting with the words\n\u2018At the request of our friends\u2026\u2019).\nTractatus de intellectibus, \u201cA Treatise on\nUnderstandings.\u201d\nSententiae secundum Magistrum Petrum, \u201cMaster\nPeter\u2019s Views.\u201d\n\n\nThe first of these is a series of elementary commentaries on the old\nlogic (though again not completely preserved); their simple level has\nled some scholars to think they must come from early in\nAbelard\u2019s career, others to deny that they are Abelard\u2019s\nwork at all. Second, the Logica \u2018nostrorum\npetitioni sociorum\u2019 is something of a work-in-progress: it\nassumes knowledge of Abelard\u2019s earlier Logica\n\u2018ingredientibus\u2019 and discusses advanced points\nnot dealt with there, but for long stretches it is also a\nstraightforward paraphrase of or commentary on Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge; it has textual parallels with some of\nAbelard\u2019s other works and shows some knowledge of theology. The\nthird work deals with concepts, or \u2018understandings\u2019, from\nboth the point of view of logic (roughly as providing the meanings of\nterms) and from the point of view of the philosophy of mind (as\nvehicles for mental content). The last work may be no more than a\nreport of some of Abelard\u2019s lectures, and is concerned with\nlogical and metaphysical puzzles about wholes and parts.\n\nThe second category consists of Abelard\u2019s works on ethics:\n\nEthica seu Scito teipsum, \u201cEthics, or, Know\nYourself.\u201d\nCollationes, \u201cConversations\u201d a.k.a.\nDialogus inter Philosophum, Iudaeum, et Christianum,\n\u201cThe Dialogue of a Philosopher with a Jew and a\nChristian\u201d.\n\n\nThe Ethics offers an analysis of moral worth and the degree\nof praise or blame that should attach to agents and their actions; it\nbreaks off at the beginning of the second book. The\nConversations is a pair of debates (among characters who\nappear to Abelard in a dream) over the nature of happiness and the\nsupreme good: the Philosopher, who claims to follow only natural\nreason, first debates with the Jew, who follows the Old Law; the\nPhilosopher then debates the Christian, who defends Christian ethics\nfrom a philosophical point of view. Abelard also wrote a slight work\nof practical advice for his son:\n\nCarmen ad Astralabium, \u201cPoem for\nAstralabe.\u201d\n\n\nMoral advice and edifying sentiments are found in this series of\ndistichs.\n\nThe third category consists of Abelard\u2019s works of philosophical\ntheology. His three main works are devoted to a philosophical analysis\nof the Trinity, the several versions representing successive stages of\nhis thought and his attempts at orthodoxy (each rewritten several\ntimes):\n\nTheologia \u2018summi boni\u2019.\n\u201cTheology\u201d (that begins with the words \u2018The highest\ngood\u2026\u2019).\nTheologia christiana, \u201cChristian\nTheology.\u201d\nTheologia \u2018scholarium\u2019,\n\u201cTheology\u201d (that begins with the words \u2018In the\nschools\u2026\u2019).\n\n\nThe first version of the Theology seems to have been the work\ncondemned at the Council of Soisssons, the last the work condemned at\nthe Council of Sens. In addition to these three works, in which\nproblems in philosophical theology are treated thematically, Abelard\nalso wrote several commentaries:\n\nExpositio orationis dominicae, \u201cAnalysis of the\nLord\u2019s Prayer.\u201d\nExpositio symboli Apostolorum, \u201cAnalysis of the\nApostle\u2019s Creed.\u201d\nExpositio fidei in symbolum Athanasii, \u201cAnalysis of\nFaith in the Athanasian Creed.\u201d\nHexa\u00ebmeron, \u201cCommentary on Genesis\n1\u20132:25.\u201d\nCommentaria in Epistolam Pauli ad Romanos,\n\u201cCommentary on St. Paul\u2019s Letter to the\nRomans.\u201d\n\n\nThe first three commentaries are brief, but Abelard\u2019s\ndiscussions of the first verses of Genesis and of\nPaul\u2019s letter are extensive and detailed (the latter also\nrelevant to Abelard\u2019s ethical theory). Abelard also took up\nquestions about faith and reason in a short work:\n\nSoliloquium, \u201cSoliloquy.\u201d\n\n\nThis brief inner dialogue, modelled on Augustine\u2019s\nSoliloquies, has \u201cPeter\u201d talking things over with\n\u201cAbelard.\u201d Theological questions of a more practical\nnature were raised by H\u00e9lo\u00efse in a series of questions she\nasked on her behalf and on behalf of the nuns of the Paraclete:\n\nProblemata Helo\u00efssae cum Petri Abaelardi\nsolutionibus, \u201cH\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s Problem-List\n(with Abelard\u2019s Solutions).\u201d\n\n\nPractical issues are also addressed in Abelard\u2019s sermons, hymns,\nand lamentations (planctus). Finally, Abelard composed an\nextremely influential theological work that contains no theoretical\nspeculation at all:\n\nSic et non, \u201cFor and Against.\u201d\n\n\nAbelard assembles a series of 158 questions, each of which is\nfurnished with patristic citations that imply a positive answer\n(sic) to the question and other patristic citations implying\na negative answer (non). Abelard does not attempt to\nharmonize these apparently inconsistent remarks, but in his preface he\nlays down rules for proper hermeneutic investigation: look for\nambiguity, check the surrounding context, draw relevant distinctions,\nand the like.\n\nAbelard\u2019s students and disciples also record many of his views,\nthough this material has yet to be explored carefully. There are\nreferences in Abelard\u2019s extant works to other works we do not\nhave: Grammatica, \u201cGrammar\u201d; Rhetorica,\n\u201cRhetoric\u201d; a commentary on Ezekiel written at\nthe beginning of his studies in theology; and others. It is possible\nsome of these works may yet be found.\n",
