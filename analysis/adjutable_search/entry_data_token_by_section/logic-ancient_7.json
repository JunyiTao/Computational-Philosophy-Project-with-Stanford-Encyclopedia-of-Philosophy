    "main_text": "Aristotle || Modal Logic\n2.5 Modal Logic\n\n\nAristotle is also the originator of modal logic. In addition to\nquality (as affirmation or negation) and quantity (as singular,\nuniversal, particular, or indefinite), he takes categorical sentences\nto have a mode; this consists of the fact that the predicate is said\nto hold of the subject either actually or necessarily or possibly or\ncontingently or impossibly. The latter four are expressed by modal\noperators that modify the predicate, e.g. \u2018It is possible for\nA to hold of some B\u2019; \u2018A\nnecessarily holds of every B\u2019.\n\n\nIn De Interpretatione 12\u201313, Aristotle (i) concludes\nthat modal operators modify the whole predicate (or the copula, as he\nputs it), not just the predicate term of a sentence. (ii) He states\nthe logical relations that hold between modal operators, such as that\n\u2018it is not possible for A not to hold of\nB\u2019 implies \u2018it is necessary for A to\nhold of B\u2019. (iii) He investigates what the\ncontradictories of modalized sentences are, and decides that they are\nobtained by placing the negator in front of the modal operator. (iv)\nHe equates the expressions \u2018possible\u2019 and\n\u2018contingent\u2019, but wavers between a one-sided\ninterpretation (where necessity implies possibility) and a two-sided\ninterpretation (where possibility implies non-necessity).\n\n\nAristotle develops his modal syllogistic in Prior Analytics\n1.8\u201322. He settles on two-sided possibility (contingency) and\ntests for syllogismhood all possible combinations of premise pairs of\nsentences with necessity (N), contingency (C) or no (U) modal\noperator: NN, CC, NU/UN, CU/UC and NC/CN. Syllogisms with the last\nthree types of premise combinations are called mixed modal\nsyllogisms. Apart from the NN category, which mirrors unmodalized\nsyllogisms, all categories contain dubious cases. For instance,\nAristotle accepts:\n\nA necessarily holds of all B.\nB holds of all C.\n Therefore A necessarily holds of all C.\n\n\n\n\nThis and other problematic cases were already disputed in antiquity,\nand more recently have sparked a host of complex formalized\nreconstructions of Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic. As Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory is conceivably internally inconsistent, the formal models that\nhave been suggested may all be unsuccessful.\n",
