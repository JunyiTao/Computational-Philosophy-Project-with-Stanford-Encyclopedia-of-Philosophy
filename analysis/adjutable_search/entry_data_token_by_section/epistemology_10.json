    "main_text": "What is Justification?\n3. What is Justification?\n\nWhatever precisely is involved in knowing a fact, it is widely\nrecognized that some of our cognitive successes fall short of\nknowledge: an agent may, for example, conduct herself in a way that is\nintellectually unimpeachable, and yet still end up thereby believing a\nfalse proposition. Julia has every reason to believe that her birthday\nis July 15: it says so on her birth certificate and all of her medical\nrecords, and everyone in her family insists that it is July 15.\nNonetheless, if all of this evidence is the result of some\ntime-keeping mistake made at the time of her birth, her belief about\nher birthday could be false, despite being so thoroughly justified.\nDebates concerning the nature of\n justification[20]\n can be understood as debates concerning the nature of such\nnon-knowledge-guaranteeing cognitive successes as the one that Julia\nenjoys in this\n example.[21]\n",
