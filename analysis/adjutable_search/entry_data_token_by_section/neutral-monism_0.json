    "main_text": "Neutral Monism || Neutrality\n1.1 Neutrality\n\nBoth of the terms that make up the label \u201cneutral monism\u201d\nare problematical. Because the questions to which the notion of\nneutrality gives rise are unique to neutral monism, they need to be\naddressed first. Most versions of neutral monism assume a plurality of\nbasic, neutral entities (these could be substances, events, tropes,\nuniversals, etc., depending on the specific form of the view). What\ndoes it mean for an entity to be neutral? Here are five proposals:\n\nThe Neither View: A basic entity is neutral just in case\nit is intrinsically neither mental nor physical.\nThe Actual Constituent View: A basic entity is neutral\njust in case it is a constituent of both physical and mental non-basic\nentities.\nThe Possible Constituent View: A basic entity is neutral\njust in case it can be a constituent of both physical and mental\nnon-basic entities.\nThe Law View: A basic entity is neutral just in case both\nmental laws and physical laws are applicable to it.\nThe Both View: A basic entity is neutral just in case it\nis intrinsically both mental and physical.\n\n\n(1)\u2013(5) are not always clearly distinguished; but even when they\nare, two or more of these criteria may be used concurrently. This\ninvites confusion on the part of the neutral monists, as well as their\ncritics.\n\nQuestions arise about the relationships between (1)\u2013(5). (1) and\n(5) are similar in letting the question of an entity\u2019s\nneutrality be settled by its intrinsic nature. (2)\u2013(4) answer\nthis question by looking at the relationships of a given entity to\nother things: to the nature of larger groups of entities of which the\ngiven entity is/can be a member: are these groups mental or material?\nOr by looking to the kinds of laws that govern the entity in question:\nare the laws mental or physical? If one is inclined to think that\nneutrality is a matter of intrinsic nature alone, (2)\u2013(4) will\nseem misguided. (2)\u2013(4) still might have a place as epistemic\ncriteria\u2014as ways of finding out whether a given entity is\nneutral. The friends of (1) and (5) can agree that a given\nentity\u2019s ability to actually or possibly belong to a certain\ngroup, or to be governed by certain laws, is due solely to its\nintrinsic nature. Their disagreement concerns only the question\nwhether this ability is conferred on that entity by its being both\nmental and physical or neither mental nor physical. In either case\n(2)\u2013(4) can only be used to discover which things are the\nneutral entities.\n\nThe traditional versions of neutral monism\u2014those developed by\nErnst Mach, William James, and Bertrand Russell\u2014accept (1) and\nreject (2). Russell, for instance, describes neutral monism as the\nview that \u201cboth mind and matter are composed of a neutral-stuff\nwhich, in isolation, is neither mental nor material\u201d (Russell\n1921: 25). But some critics of neutral monism, notably Bostock (2012:\n190, 195\u20136), interpret neutral monism as committed to (2). Based\non this interpretation of neutrality, Bostock arrives at the striking\nconclusion that \u201cRussell\u2019s version of neutral monism was\nnever properly \u2018neutral\u2019 or \u2018monistic\u2019\u201d\n(Bostock 2012: 190).\n\nIt can be argued that none of the traditional neutral monists accept\n(3). All of them would agree that neutral entities can be a\nconstituent of both physical and mental non-basic entities. But it is\ndoubtful whether any of them would agree that the fact that a basic\nentity can be a constituent of both physical and mental non-basic\nentities is sufficient to make it neutral. For it is conceivable that\na basic entity that fails to be neutral (according to (1), the\nNeither View) should figure in the construction of both\nphysical and mental non-basic entities.\n\n(4) is present in the thought of Mach and James. But it plays a\nprominent part in Russell\u2019s thought. In the opening chapter of\nhis 1921 The Analysis of Mind, Russell remarks:\n\nThere are, it seems to me, prima facie different kinds of\ncausal laws, one belonging to physics and the other to psychology. The\nlaw of gravitation, for example, is a physical law, while the law of\nassociation is a psychological law. Sensations are subject to both\nkinds of laws, and therefore are truly \u201cneutral\u201d in\n[Edwin] Holt\u2019s sense. But entities subject only to physical\nlaws, or only to psychological laws, are not neutral, and may be\ncalled respectively purely material and purely mental. (Russell 1921:\n25\u201326)\n\n\nHis use of (1) in conjunction with (4), especially in Russell 1921, is\nconfusing, and it has led a number of his critics (Stace 1946; Bostock\n2012) to argue that his neutral monism is best understood as a form of\ndualism (at least in his early writings).\n\nA more general issue with criteria (2)\u2013(4) is that they make\nneutral monism compatible with materialism, idealism, and/or dualism,\nas traditionally understood. So long as the basic entities, no\nmatter what their intrinsic nature may be, satisfy the criteria\nspecified in (2), (3), or (4) they are, according to these criteria,\nneutral. Gregory Landini, for instance, assumes that (3) captures\nRussell\u2019s idea of neutrality and concludes that he is a\nphysicalist and a neutral monist (Landini 2011: ch.6).\nAccording to Landini, Russell is a neutral monist because every basic\nentity can be a constituent of both physical and mental non-basic\nentities; and Russell is a physicalist because all basic entities of\nhis system are physical.\n\nThe traditional neutral monists reject (5), but many of their\nformulations suggest otherwise. It is easy to find passages saying\nthat a given neutral entity is both physical and mental:\n\nIf we admit\u2014as I think we should\u2014that the patch of color\nmay be both physical and psychical, the reason for distinguishing the\nsense-datum from the sensation disappears, and we may say that the\npatch of color and our sensation in seeing it are identical. (Russell\n1921: 143)\n\n\nA sympathetic reading of passages such as these suggests that they are\nbest understood as an abbreviated way of saying that the given neutral\nentity is a member of two groups of neutral entities, one of which\ncounts as physical, the other of which counts as mental. In fact, many\nneutral monists hold that the terms \u201cphysical\u201d and\n\u201cmental\u201d apply only to groups of neutral entities, not\nindividual ones:\n\nThe stuff of which the world of our experience is composed is, in my\nbelief, neither mind nor matter, but something more primitive than\neither. Both mind and matter seem to be composite, and the stuff of\nwhich they are compounded lies in a sense between the two, in a sense\nabove them both, like a common ancestor. (Russell 1921: 10\u201311)\n\n\nBut a number of contemporary discussions of neutral monism employ the\nBoth View. This view has, for instance, been attributed to\nThomas Nagel (Godfrey-Smith 2013: 1\u20132; Skrbina 2005:\n 237).[1]\n The Both View has the advantage of capturing one intuitive\nnotion of neutrality: that which is both mental and material is biased\ntowards neither and hence neutral between them.\n\nDespite this appeal, the Both View idea of neutrality\nconflates (or at least invites conflation of) neutral monism with\nother theories from which it should be distinguished. Indeed,\ndepending on how the claim that the basic entities are intrinsically\nboth mental and physical is understood, neutral monism becomes\ndifficult to distinguish from panpsychism, dual-aspect theory, and\neven the identity theory\u2014since \u201cbeing a pain\u201d and\n\u201cbeing a c-fiber stimulation\u201d, for example, pick out the\nvery same property, aspect, or state rather than two distinct and\nirreducible ones (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.6 below). In contrast,\nthe Neither View idea of neutrality allows us to understand\nneutral monism as a distinct type of theory, and so is in this respect\npreferable.\n\nThere are, however, a number of complications shared by (1)\u2013(5).\nFor one thing, they all use the concepts \u201cmental\u201d and\n\u201cphysical\u201d to specify the notion of neutrality. And since\nthese terms are used in different ways, the notion of the neutral\nvaries accordingly. In the case of the term \u201cmental\u201d, most\nneutral monists understand it as picking out entities in terms of\nfeatures traditionally associated with mental phenomena, such as\nintentionality, experientiality, subjectivity, qualitativity, unity,\npurposiveness, and so on. But there are diverging views among neutral\nmonists about which of these features are unique to and/or possessed\nby mental phenomena. Similarly, there is no consensus about whether\nthe term \u201cphysical\u201d is restricted to those aspects of\nreality that can be fully captured by the descriptions of physics or\nextends beyond such descriptive resources (Stoljar 2001). And while\nsome use the terms \u201cmaterial\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d\ninterchangeably, others see \u201cmaterial\u201d as applying to\nentities with the features traditionally ascribed to matter (such as\noccupying space, crowding out other such entities, and enduring\nthrough changes in features) whereas \u201cphysical\u201d might pick\nout entities lacking one or more of them. Most pressingly, if\n\u201cmental\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d are defined as\ncomplements of each other, thereby ruling out the possibility of\nentities to which neither term applies, then there cannot be\nany neutral entities (at least in the neither sense).\n\nAnother worry is that (1)\u2013(4) don\u2019t say anything about the\nnature of the neutral entities. (1) says only what they are not;\n(2)\u2013(4) specify certain roles that neutral entities can play,\nwithout telling us anything about the nature of the role occupants.\n(5) may fare better in this regard; but it arguably cannot distinguish\nbasic neutral entities from those of panpsychism, dual-aspect\ntheory, or the identity theory. Some versions of neutral monism\nembrace this agnosticism about the nature of the neutral base. But\nothers have been more forthcoming, offering examples of neutral\nentities with which we are familiar.\n\nThe three traditional neutral monists\u2014Ernst Mach, William James,\nand Bertrand Russell\u2014all pointed to entities encountered in\nexperience as examples of neutral phenomena. Mach speaks of\n\u201csensations\u201d, James of \u201cpure experience\u201d, and\nRussell of \u201csensations\u201d and \u201cpercepts\u201d.\nPredictably, this has fueled the suspicion that neutral monism is\nnothing but rebranded phenomenalism. Others have sought the neutral\nbase in the realm of the abstract. Kenneth Sayre, for example, turns\nto the mathematical theory of information and suggests that the\nneutral base is to be understood as the \u201contology of\ninformational states\u201d (Sayre 1976: 16) that this theory\npresupposes (see section 5.1 below). What is clear is that it is no\neasy task to characterize basic entities in a way that is both\nsubstantive and incontrovertibly neutral.\n",
