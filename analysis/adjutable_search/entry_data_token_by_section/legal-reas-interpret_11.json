    "main_text": "The Role of Coherence in Legal Reasoning: || Why Should Coherence Play a Role in Legal Reasoning?\n3.5 Coherence in Legal Reasoning: Global or Local?\n\n\nIn considering the role of coherence in legal reasoning, a final point\nto mention is that of how much of the law is to be made coherent\naccording to various jurisprudential accounts granting a role to\nconsiderations of coherence. Are we talking of global coherence, such\nthat judges should strive to reach judicial decisions which cohere to\nsome extent with the settled law of an entire legal system, or should\nthe coherence we seek be more local in nature, e.g. coherence with\nparticular branches or areas of law? \n\n\nLevenbook 1984 is a supporter of local coherence, and criticises\nthose who, like Sartorius (1968 and 1971) and Dworkin (1977, and,\nalthough not yet written at the time of Levenbook's article, Dworkin\n1986), hold that justified judicial decisions are those which best\ncohere with the law as a whole. According to Levenbook, champions of\nglobal coherence ignore the fact that sometimes a legally justified\ndecision is supported by, in the sense of cohering with, principles\nwhich are distinctive of one area or branch of the law, but the\nprinciples concerned differ substantially from, and hence do not cohere\nwell with principles from other branches of law. On this line of\nthinking, the judicial decision which coheres best with the principles\nunderlying some specific field of law may not result in increased\ncoherence of the entire system of law. That global coherence theorists\nmay well be led to reject such a decision, and to hold that an\nalternative decision which coheres well with the overall system of law,\nbut which increases incoherence locally is the more strongly justified,\nis, for Levenbook, a good reason to reject their theories: she contends\nthat any plausible account of adjudication must make room for the kind\nof \u2018area-specific coherence\u2019 which she believes is\nnecessary in the case of law. Raz 1994a also champions local over\nglobal coherence in adjudication, and his argument mentioned in the\nprevious section concerning the limitations on the reforming role of\ncourts, and the way in which this sometimes militates in favour of\ncoherence playing a role in judicial decision making, is intended to\nsupport local coherence only. Peczenik 1994 claims that while the goal\nof the kind of doctrinal interpretation undertaken by legal scholars\n(which he refers to as \u2018legal dogmatics\u2019) is to establish\nthe unity of an entire legal system, the judicial interpretation\nundertaken by judges is of a far more local variety, as it is concerned\nmerely with the norms applicable to the case in question, and because a\ncoherent interpretation of those norms may decrease their coherence\nwith other legal norms.\n\n\nWhile, as Levenbook 1984 notes, Dworkin's account of integrity in\nadjudication requires judges to attempt to view the legal system as a\nwhole as exhibiting coherence and speaking with one voice in\ninterpreting the law, Dworkin does also recognise that\ncompartmentalisation into different branches or areas of law is an\nindisputable feature of legal practice, and he accordingly attempts to\nintegrate it within his vision of adjudicative integrity. He does so\nvia his doctrine of local priority in interpretation, i.e. that if a\ngiven principle justifying a judicial decision does not fit at all\nwell with the area of law which the case is classified as falling\nunder, then this counts dramatically against deciding the case in\naccordance with that principle, no matter how well such an\ninterpretation coheres with other areas of the law (see Dworkin 1986,\nch. 7). However, because of the strong pull toward global coherence in\nlaw as integrity\u2014expressed in Dworkin's claim that it is\nnecessary to strive to view the legal system as a whole as speaking\nwith one voice, the voice of an authentic political community, in\norder that law can be seen as justifying state coercion\u2014the\ncurrent compartmentalisation of the law is not an unrevisable given\nfor judges deciding cases, rather, it, too, is something which is\nsubject to the Dworkinian process of constructive interpretation. This\nbeing so, he claims, when the compartmentalisation of the law does not\ntrack widely held principles of those subject to the law accounting\ncurrent classificatory boundaries as important, then the doctrine of\nlocal priority is to be given much less force. Indeed, where there is\na serious mismatch between the current compartmentalisation and actual\nviews about relevant similarities and differences between areas of law\nheld by those subject to it, it might be possible for judges to\ndiscard the doctrine of local priority altogether, and undertake\nradical reform of some departments of law in order to make them cohere\nbetter with others, or even to erase entire the alleged boundaries\nbetween certain branches of law in the course of interpreting the law\nand applying it to new cases.\n",
