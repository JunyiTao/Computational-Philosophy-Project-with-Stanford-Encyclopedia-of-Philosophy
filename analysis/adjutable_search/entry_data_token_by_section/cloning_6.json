    "main_text": "Human Reproductive Cloning\n3. Human Reproductive Cloning\n\nThe central argument in favor of reproductive cloning is expansion of\nopportunities for reproduction. Reproductive cloning could offer a new\nmeans for prospective parents to satisfy their reproductive goals or\ndesires. Infertile individuals or couples could have a child that is\ngenetically related to them. In addition, individuals, same sex\ncouples, or couples who cannot together produce an embryo would no\nlonger need donor gametes to reproduce if cloning were available (some\nmight still need donor eggs for the cloning procedure, but these would\nbe enucleated so that only the mitochondrial DNA remains). It would\nthen be possible to avoid that one\u2019s child shares half of her\nnuclear DNA with a gamete donor.\n\nUsing cloning to help infertile people to have a genetically related\nchild, or a child that is only genetically related to them, has been\ndefended on the grounds of human wellbeing, personal autonomy, and the\nsatisfaction of the natural inclination to produce offspring\n(H\u00e4yry 2003; Strong 2008). Offering individuals or couples the\npossibility to reproduce using cloning technology has been said to be\nconsistent with the right to reproductive freedom, which, according to\nsome, implies the right to choose what kind of children we will have\n(Brock 1998, 145).\n\nAccording to some, the main benefit of reproductive cloning is that it\nwould enable prospective parents to control what genome their children\nwill be endowed with (Fletcher 1988, Harris 1997, 2004; Pence 1998,\n101\u20136; Tooley 1998). Cloning would enable parents to have a\nchild with a genome identical to that of a person with good health\nand/or other desirable characteristics.\n\nAnother possible use of reproductive cloning is to create a child that\nis a tissue match for a sick sibling. The stem cells from the\numbilical cord blood or from the bone marrow of the cloned child could\nbe used to treat the diseased sibling. Such \u2018saviour\nsiblings\u2019, have already been created through sexual reproduction\nor, more efficiently, through a combination of IVF, preimplantation\ngenetic diagnosis and HLA testing.\n\nMany people, however, have expressed concerns about human reproductive\ncloning. For some, these concerns are sufficient to reject human\ncloning. For others, these concerns should be weighed against reasons\nfor reproductive cloning.\n\nWhat follows is an outline of some of the main areas of concern and\ndisagreement about human reproductive cloning.\n",
