    "main_text": "\u201cGeometrization of Physics\u201d: Platonism, Transcendental Idealism, Structuralism || Meyerson on \u201cPangeometrism\u201d\n5.6 Meyerson on \u201cPangeometrism\u201d\n\nWithin physics the idealist currents lying behind the world geometries\nof Weyl and Eddington were largely ignored, whereas within philosophy,\nwith the notable exception of \u00c9mile Meyerson\u2019s La\nD\u00e9duction Relativiste (1925). Meyerson, who had no doubt\nconcerning the basic realist impetus of science, carefully\ndistinguished Einstein\u2019s \u201crational deduction of the\nphysical world\u201d from the speculative geometrical unifications of\ngravitation and electromagnetism of Weyl and Eddington. These\ntheories, as affirmations of a complete panmathematicism, or\nrather of a pangeometrism (1925: \u00a7\u00a7 157\u201358),\nwere compared to the rationalist deductions of Hegel\u2019s\nLogic. That general relativity succeeded in partly realizing\nDescartes\u2019 program of reducing the physical to the spatial\nthrough geometric deduction, is due to the fact that Einstein\n\u201cfollowed in the footsteps\u201d of Descartes, not Hegel (1925:\n\u00a7133). But pan-geometrism is also capable of\noverreaching itself and this is the transgression committed by both\nWeyl and Eddington. Weyl in particular is singled out for criticism\nfor seemingly to have reverted to Hegel\u2019s monistic idealism, and\nso to be subject to its fatal flaw. In regarding nature as completely\nintelligible, Weyl had abolished the thing-in-itself and so promoted\nthe identity of self and non-self, the great error of the\nNaturphilosophien.\n\nThough he had \u201call due respect to the writings of such\ndistinguished scientists\u201d as Weyl and Eddington, Meyerson took\ntheir overt affirmations of idealism to be misguided attempts\n\u201cto associate themselves with a philosophical point of view that\nis in fact quite foreign to the relativistic doctrine\u201d (1925:\n\u00a7150). That \u201cpoint of view\u201d is in fact two distinct\nspecies of transcendental idealism. It is above all\n\u201cforeign\u201d to relativity theory because Meyerson cannot see\nhow it is possible to \u201creintegrate the four-dimensional world of\nrelativity theory into the self\u201d. After all, Kant\u2019s own\nargument for Transcendental Idealism proceeded \u201cin a single\nstep\u201d, in establishing the subjectivity of the space and time of\n\u201cour na\u00efve intuition\u201d. But this still leaves\n\u201cthe four dimensional universe of relativity independent of the\nself\u201d. Any attempt to \u201creintegrate\u201d four-dimensional\nspacetime into the self would have to proceed at a \u201csecond\nstage\u201d where, additionally, there would be no \u201csolid\nfoundation\u201d such as spatial and temporal intuition furnished\nKant at the first stage. Perhaps, Meyerson allowed, there is indeed\n\u201canother intuition, purely mathematical in nature\u201d, lying\nbehind spatial and temporal intuition, and capable of \u201cimagining\nthe four-dimensional universe, to which, in turn, it makes reality\nconform\u201d. This would make intuition a \u201ctwo-stage\nmechanism\u201d. While all of this is not\n\u201cinconceivable\u201d, it does appear, nonetheless,\n\u201crather complex and difficult if one reflects upon it\u201d. In\nany case, this is likely to be unnecessary, for considering the matter\n\u201cwith an open mind\u201d,\n\n\none would seem to be led to the position of those who believe that\nrelativity theory tends to destroy the concept of Kantian intuition.\n(1925: \u00a7\u00a7 151\u20132)\n\n\nMeyerson had come right up to the threshold of grasping the\nWeyl-Eddington geometric unification schemes in something like the\nsense in which they were intended. The stumbling block for him, and\nfor others, is the conviction that transcendental idealism can be\nsupported only from an argument about the nature of intuition, and\nintuitive representation. To be sure, the geometric framework for\nWeyl\u2019s construction of the objective four-dimensional world of\nrelativity is based upon the Evidenz available in\n\u201cessential insight\u201d, which is limited to the simple linear\nrelations and mappings in what is basically the tangent vector space\n\\(T_P\\) at a point P in a manifold. Thus in Weyl\u2019s\ndifferential geometry there is a fundamental divide between integrable\nand non-integrable relations of comparison. The latter are primitive\nand epistemologically privileged, but nonetheless not justified until\nit is shown how the infinitesimal homogeneous spaces, corresponding to\nthe \u201cessence of space as a form of intuition\u201d, are\ncompatible with the large-scale inhomogeneous spaces (spacetimes) of\ngeneral relativity. And this required not a philosophical argument\nabout the nature of intuition, but one formulated in group-theoretic\nconceptual form (Weyl 1923a,b). Eddington, on the other hand,\nwithout the cultural context of Husserlian phenomenology or indeed of\nphilosophy generally, jettisoned the intuitional basis of\ntranscendental idealism altogether, as if unaware of its prominence.\nThus he sought a superior and completely general conceptual\nbasis for the objective four-dimensional world of relativity theory by\nconstituting that world within a geometry (its \u201cworld\nstructure\u201d (1923)) based upon a non-metrical affine (i.e.,\nlinear and symmetric) connection. He was then free to find his own way\nto the empirically confirmed integrable metric relations of\nEinstein\u2019s theory without being hampered by the conflict of a\n\u201cpure infinitesimal\u201d metric with the observed facts about\natomic spectra.\n",
