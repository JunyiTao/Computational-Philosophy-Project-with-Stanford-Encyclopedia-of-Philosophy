    "main_text": "Christian August Crusius || Life and Works\n5.1 Life and Works\n\nChristian August Crusius was born 10 June 1715 in Leuna, near Halle,\nthe son of a pastor (and his mother was a pastor\u2019s daughter). He\nmatriculated at the University of Leipzig in 1734, where he studied a\nnumber of subjects but was particularly interested in theology and\nphilosophy. At Leipzig, Crusius came under the influence of the\nphilosopher (and physician) Adolf Friedrich Hoffmann\n(1707\u20131741), a disciple of Andreas R\u00fcdiger\n(1673\u20131731) who had been a close associate of Thomasius. Crusius\nattained the Magister in philosophy in 1737 and habilitated\nin philosophy in 1740. He followed his philosophical studies with a\nbaccalaureat in theology in 1742, though he would proceed to seek a\nposition in the philosophy faculty. To this end, he defended two\ndissertations in philosophy, one of which, the Dissertatio\nphilosophica de usu et limitibus principii rationis determinantis,\nvulgo sufficientis (Philosophical Dissertation on the Use and\nLimits of the Principle of Determining Reason, commonly called\nSufficient) of 1743 was a critical discussion of the principle of\nsufficient reason. He became a professor of philosophy\n(extraordinarius) at Leipzig in 1744.\n\nCrusius\u2019 major philosophical works followed in quick succession.\nHe published his textbook on ethics, the Anweisung vern\u00fcnftig\nzu Leben (Guide to Rational Living) in 1744; this was\nfollowed by the elaboration of his metaphysics, Entwurf der\nnothwendigen Vernunft-Wahrheiten (Sketch of the Necessary\nTruths of Reason) in 1745; and a text in logic, the Weg zur\nGewi\u00dfheit und Zuverl\u00e4\u00dfigkeit der menschlichen\nErkennti\u00df (Path to the Certainty and Reliability of\nHuman Cognition) was published in 1747 (a final philosophical\ntreatise on physics followed in 1749). As an ordinary professorship in\nphilosophy was not available, Crusius joined the theology faculty at\nLeipzig in 1750. While he remained a member of the philosophy faculty\nand continued his lectures (and revised his previous publications for\nlater editions), from this point on his original publications are\ndevoted to theological topics. He died in Leipzig on 18 October\n1775.\n",
