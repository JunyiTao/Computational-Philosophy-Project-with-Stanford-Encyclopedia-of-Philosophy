    "main_text": "Early Psychiatric Writings\n3. Early Psychiatric Writings\n\nLess well-known, at least among the world of English-speaking\npsychiatry, is Jaspers\u2019s lasting contribution to the field of\npsychiatry that preceded his philosophical work, and in retrospect\ntranspires as not wholly unrelated it, at least in its common guiding\nspirit. During his distinguished career as a psychiatrist, Jaspers\nachieved an outstanding contribution to psychiatric thinking, later\ncalled \u2018The Heidelberg School\u2019 and led by Kurt Schneider.\nAs a young man, he authored a number of scientific articles on\nhomesickness and crime, on intelligence tests, on hallucinations\n\u2013 all illustrated with detailed case histories. Also, Jaspers\npublished reports of the mental pathology of Van Gogh and Stirnberg.\nAmong these, of special importance are his outstanding article from\n1910, in which he introduced his method and fundamental principles\nregarding \u2018mental processes\u2019 and \u2018personality\ndevelopment\u2019, and an article on the phenomenological method in\npsychiatry from 1912, which established his pioneer status as a first\ncommentator on the phenomenological study of subjective experiences at\nthe conscious level. At the age of barely thirty, in 1913, while he\nwas working as a physician in the psychiatric hospital at Heidelberg,\nJaspers published his Allgemeine Psychopathologie: Ein Leitfaden\nf\u00fcr Studierenden, \u00c4rzte und Psychologen (General\nPsychopathology: A Guide for Students, Physicians and Psychologists).\nThe aims of this book were to provide the framework of the scientific\nfield of psychopathology and its related facts and approaches, not\nonly for practitioners in this filed but also for interested\nintellectuals. This framework covers the problems and methods that\ncapture the body of knowledge of the field rather than empirical\nevidence or a system based on a theory. Instead of deciding between\nthe different existing approaches of his time, he stressed their\npeculiarity that entails the inherent justifications and the way they\nmight complement each other and together portray the many sides of the\npsychopathological science. The hint of the spirit of his existential\nphilosophy, yet to become expressed, is apparent in his declaration in\nthe preface of the book, according to which \u201cin psychopathology\nit is dangerous merely to learn the matter, our task is not to\n\u2018learn psychopathology\u2019 but to learn to observe, ask\nquestions, analyze, and think in psychopathological terms\u201d.\nHowever, despite the very impressive of the achievement of the\nmentioned book, which within the German speaking world was recognized\nby leading psychiatrists as a monumental achievement in the field, it\nmarked the culmination of Jaspers\u2019s psychiatric productivity.\nJust two years later, Jaspers moved away forever from psychiatric\npractice and medicine in general, first towards psychology and then\nphilosophy. Interestingly, though, Jaspers saw fit to revise and\nexpand the text in a few of its several editions. The first edition is\nthe shortest. In the second and third editions, there were minor\nchanges. The most considerably revised and expanded edition is the\nfourth, which appeared in 1942. To a large extent, the integration of\nmany ideas from his then already mature existential philosophy from\nthe thirties onwards, which more than doubled the scope of the text,\nin fact amount to a new version of the book. Now, the subtitle that\nappeared in the earlier versions was removed and in the preface\nJaspers indicates its high aim of satisfying the demand for knowledge,\nnot only for physicians but for all who make mankind their theme. In\nthis enlarged version of the book, the imprint of Husserl\u2019s\ndescriptive psychology is apparent in the attempt to address the inner\nmental experiences of mentally ill people (mainly schizophrenic\npatients) and regard them as indicative of the general phenomena of\nhuman consciousness, i.e.: delusions, modes of ego-consciousness, and\nmodes of emotions. At the same time, the imprint of Wilhelm Dilthey\n(1833\u20131911) was perceptible in the centrality given to the\ndistinction between \u2018understanding psychology\u2019\n(Verstehende Psychologie), which relates to meaningful and\ncomprehensible connections that are inherent in one\u2019s\npersonality and biography, and \u2018explaining psychology\u2019\n(Erkl\u00e4rende Psychologie), which focuses on causal\nconnections that are mainly rooted in\n biology.1]\n\nJaspers\u2019s declared conviction that the methodological principles\nremain largely unaffected by the increased materials supported his\nefforts to add entire sections to the new versions of the book \u2013\nsections that aptly reveal his philosophical view on the pertinent\nconsiderations in curing mental illness. Notwithstanding this, Jaspers\nopposed the attempts to address existentialist ideas for the sake of\nunderstanding mental illness. For him it is not possible that a human\nbeing as a whole falls ill or alternatively that illness of any kind\ncan cover one\u2019s entire being, rather there are always parts that\nremain uninfected with illness or healthy.\n\nIt is worth noting that the appearance of the fourth edition of\nGeneral Psychopathology was enabled despite the publication\nban to which Jaspers was subject since 1938 for his outspoken and\nuncompromising resistance to the Nazis regime and his persistent\nloyalty to his Jewish wife. Probably the same title from 1913 and the\nscientific character, which covered the fact of incorporation of the\nof considerable sections which where imprinted with his philosophical\nthinking, were helpful in this regard. Despite ceasing practicing\npsychiatry, Jaspers retain his interest in psychopathology and was\nfully aware of the developments in the field, in particular regarding\nthe neurological and somatic aspects of mental illness. However, after\nthe fourth edition appeared, five more were printed in the same format\nas the fourth, the latest appearing in 1973. An English translation\nexists for the seventh edition only and was published in 1963 by J.\nHoenig and Miriam Hamilton. For various reasons\u2014starting from\nnot considering the \u2018real causes\u2019 of mental illness,\ncontinuing with its loaded style of writing and argumentation, its\nsevere (though inconsistent) criticism of psychoanalysis, which at\nthat time was regarded as indispensable in any consideration of\npsychopathology, and other reasons\u2014the reception of General\nPsychopathology in the English-speaking countries was far from\nenthusiastic, except for the most respectful, and was sometimes even\nhostile.\n",
