    "preamble": "\n\nLatin American feminism, which in this entry includes Caribbean\nfeminism, is rooted in the social and political context defined by\ncolonialism, the enslavement of African peoples, and the\nmarginalization of Native peoples. Latin American feminism focuses on\nthe critical work that women have undertaken in reaction to the forces\nthat created this context. At present, the context is dominated by\nneoliberal economic policies that, in the environment of\nglobalization, have disproportionally impacted the most vulnerable\nsegments of society. Against this political backdrop, Latin American\nfeminism is grounded in the material lives of people, often women, as\nit explores the tensions engendered by the confluence of histories\nthat generate relationships among gender, citizenship, race/ethnicity,\nsexuality, class, community, and religion.\n\nLatin American feminism broadly encompasses multiple positions, many\nof which are in tension with each other. As a result, many refer to\nLatin American \u201cfeminisms\u201d in the plural. The diversity of\nfeminisms is owed to the various regions and their histories which\ndemanded social, cultural, governmental, and organizational\ntransformations in their own capacities. Hence, the present discussion\nof the general concept of Latin American feminism methodologically\nnecessitates historical sensitivity to apprehend the intimate\nrelationship between the development of different ideas and the\nheterogeneous political conditions that give rise to them.\n\nIn the United States, tracing the history of Latin American feminism\nand its ideas is an urgent task. While growing interest in the broader\nLatin American philosophy calls for increased textual representation\nand access, the role that women have played in the evolution of Latin\nAmerican philosophical ideas has been largely neglected. Yet, there\nexists a wealth of critical feminist ideas for theories of identity,\npolitics, and culture.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. History: A Genealogy of Latin American Feminism\n1.1 Latin American Feminist Origins (Pre-20th Century)\n\nMost historical genealogies of Latin American feminism trace their\norigins to the social movements beginning in the 1960s and 1970s\ncentered around women\u2019s liberation. However, feminist ideas in\nLatin America are much older than those which have been documented as\npart of feminist political action. The origins of Latin American\nfeminist ideas can be found in reflections on conditions of otherness\nthat emerge as a result of colonialism and in critiques of norms that\nrender the category of man the entry point for humanity. By the 60s\nand 70s, feminism in Latin America had a firmly rooted history\nconcerned with articulating difference and alterity from a\nnon-dominant perspective (Gargallo 2004: 80).\n\nThe existence of a genealogy of Latin American feminisms brings to the\nfore the relationship between women and history. Getting to know the\npast was a critical and necessary component of the feminist movements\nof 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. The past framed the existence of\nhistorical examples of women\u2019s struggles that served as\nendorsements for the claims of feminist movements (Palacios\n2007: 96). The failure of history to collect the life and action\nof women required new perspectives, which came to include the search\nfor forgotten figures, attention to subjects like the body and female\nsexuality, models of femininity, and attention to structural systems\nof oppression as necessary points of departure for what would become\nthe genre of feminist of scholarship (Palacios 2007: 98). \n\nNotwithstanding, there are still lacunas in Latin American feminist\ngenealogy as the writings of non-white women from the 19th\nand early 20th centuries (and earlier) are seldom found in\nwritten form, given that many non-white women were illiterate, and\ntheir stories were not textually documented. Their ideas and histories\nwere orally transmitted, and current local oral traditions account for\nthem (Gargallo 2010: 12a). Oral history projects enable contemporary\nlisteners to hear the voices of voiceless women and be witness to the\ndocument of concerns that grow out of poverty and colonial obscurity\n(Oliver 2018, 32). For instance, the colonial resistance of\nBara\u00fanda, wife of Garifuna leader Satuy\u00e9, is legendary\nfor her people; her memory travels in songs sung by Garifuna women of\nHonduras and Belize. Similarly, the story of Anacaona, Taino chief\n(cacica) of Jaragua Hispa\u00f1ola, is one of colonial\nresistance; prior to her execution she was offered clemency in return\nfor becoming a concubine for a Spaniard, and her refusal and\nsubsequent death solidified her legendary status which is immortalized\nin songs from Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. The stories\nof Indigenous women of these times continue to be shared orally\nthrough myth, songs, and proverbs, and contribute to the foundations\nof Latin American feminist thought (Gargallo 2010: 14a).\n\nOne of the earliest documented writers in the Latin American feminist\ntradition comes from the 17th century. Arguing in favor of\nthe educational and intellectual rights of women, Juana In\u00e9s\nMar\u00eda del Carmen Mart\u00ednez de Zaragoza Gaxiola de Asbaje\ny Ram\u00edrez de Santillana Odonoj\u00fa (1651\u20131695),\nrecognized by many as Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz or Sor Juana of\nMexico, was a self-educated scholar of the Baroque period whose\nwritings have garnered quite a bit of philosophical attention as part\nof the Latin American philosophical canon. She was well known during\nher lifetime as evidenced by multiple publications of her work.\nHowever, by the second half of the 18th century, her fame\ndiminished as attention to Baroque poetry declined. In 1951, her work\nrecovered attention with the publication of her complete works\n(Gargallo 2009: 419). Subsequently, Juana Ines de la Cruz has\nbecome an iconic Latin American feminist figure whose work exemplifies\nthe existence of lettered women intellectuals who resisted systems of\ndomination. For instance, Approaches to the Theory of Freedom in\nSor Juana Ines de la Cruz (2018) advances a philosophical\nexploration on freedom in the corpus of Juana Ines\u2019 and\nmethodologically situates her in the Mexican philosophical tradition\n(Aspe Armella 2018).  Alternatively, in Feminist Perspectives\non Sor Juana Ines de La Cruz (ed. Stephanie Merrimm 1999) Juana\nInes is framed in terms of her feminist impact on literature and\nculture in an anthology that bridges her from the past into the\npresent. \n\nJuana In\u00e9s de la Cruz was one among many feminist writers who\nadvocated for social and cultural changes, including the role of\nwomen. Teresa Margarida da Silva e Orta of Brazil (1711\u20131793)\nwas the first woman in the Portuguese-speaking world to publish a\nnovel and the first Brazilian-born person to edit a book in Europe.\nShe advocated for the autonomy of the Indigenous and the rights of\nwomen in science (Gargallo 2004: 80). Flora Trist\u00e1n of\nPer\u00fa (1803\u20131844) argued for women\u2019s equality and\nits important relationship to workers\u2019 rights (Gargallo 2004:\n80). Argentinian abolitionist Juana Manso (1819\u20131875) detailed\neducation and philosophical instruction as a route to the moral and\nintellectual emancipation of women. This position was taken up at the\nend of the century by figures like Rita Cetina Guti\u00e9rrez of\nMexico (1846\u20131908) and Visitaci\u00f3n Padilla of Honduras\n(1882\u20131960) (Gargallo 2009: 418). Cetina Guti\u00e9rrez\nfounded La Siempreviva in M\u00e9rida, Mexico\u2019s first secular\nschool for poor girls and an art college for young women. She is cited\nas one of Mexico\u2019s first feminists who promoted secular\neducation of women and fought for their self-determination. Padilla\nfounded the Sociedad Cultural Feminina, which promoted access to\neducation, especially for women. Venezuelan Teresa de la Parra\n(1889-1936) used writing as a mechanism of resistance from which to\nquestion the limitations of the gendered experience exemplifying the\nway that literature can be both political and philosophical. Broadly\nspeaking, feminist ideas are rooted in women\u2019s personal\nexperience and this relationship is readily explored through\nliterature, poetry, and testimonial narrative that concretely reflects\nthe feminist maxim \u201cthe personal is political\u201d (Schutte\n1993: 213).  \n\nThe existence of early Latin American feminist ideas was not attended\nto until years after their inception. The impact of ideas centering on\nwomen\u2019s rights to intellectual and educational life, equality,\nand workers\u2019 rights was not immediate since they were not given\nimportance in their respective contexts. During the feminist movements\nof the 20th century, many of these figures re-emerged as\npart of a Latin American feminist theoretical landscape (Gargallo\n2004: 81). Early Latin American feminist ideas came to be evaluated\nthrough historical memory that gives weight to the claim that Latin\nAmerican feminist ideas existed prior to the women\u2019s movements\nof the 1960s and 1970s. The existence of early Latin American\nfeminist ideas that predate the feminist movement questions the\nrelationship between women, history, and epistemology (Palacios\n2007: 104). In this context, the philosophical demand is a\nreading of the past complexly incorporating women as political actors\nand knowledge producers even if they were not seen as such in their\ntimes. \n1.2 Latin American Feminist Ideas of the Early 20th Century\n\nFeminist ideas from the early 20th century are\ntransnational. Ideas move with pushes for social change. Hence, a key\nissue for contemporary Latin American feminist writers is the\nimportance of tracking the movement of ideas and reminding us that\nideas migrate and reconfigure depending on their contexts. The\nintersection between women\u2019s ideas about resistance and the\nideas that could lead to social transformation was not necessarily\nunderstood as feminist in its time. More often than not, women\u2019s\nideas in regards to justice, equality, and political change converged\nwith other political projects that focused on improving the poor\nworking class\u2019s conditions and not specifically women\u2019s\nconditions. Their ideas for social change were molded into general\nclaims about access to education and transformation of laboring\nmaterial conditions. Ideas that are now coded as feminist are\nidentified as such in retrospect, but in order to do them justice,\nthey need to be accounted for in their historicity.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution (1910\u20131920) had a profound impact on the\ndevelopment of feminist ideas (Gargallo 2004: 82). Most notably, the\nrevolution focused on education, and in this political landscape,\nfeminist ideas had the historical impact of influencing the thoughts\nand actions of women in Mexican society (Gargallo 2004: 82). In 1915,\nSalvador Alvarado became governor of the Yucat\u00e1n and functioned\nas a vehicle for social and political change until 1918 when he was\ncalled to return to military duty. He supported a feminist movement in\nthe region initiated by Rita Cetina Guti\u00e9rrez in 1870, noted\nearlier as one of Mexico\u2019s earliest feminists and founder of La\nSiempreviva. Moreover, his tenure in office gave room and support for\nwomen\u2019s political activism in the region. The first two feminist\ncongresses in the history of Mexico were held in M\u00e9rida in\nJanuary and November of 1916, giving floor to discussions on the right\nto vote and political participation, abortion and contraception, as\nwell as education (Gargallo 2004: 83). By 1923, the socialist party of\nthe Yucat\u00e1n had three women deputies and one alternate\n(Gargallo 2004: 84).\n\nGiven the impact of the Mexican Revolution, it is no surprise that\nsome of the first feminist ideas to reach historical identification\nare found in its wake. Nevertheless, feminist ideas stretched beyond\nMexico and across Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1880, women\nabolitionists in Brazil published a newspaper titled A\nfamilia and argued for changes in dress norms. In 1910, Argentina\nwitnessed the first Feminist International Congress which fought for\npeace, education, and social participation (Gargallo 2004: 85). In\n1912, women in Colombia declared the defense of civil rights of\nmarried women. In 1916, women in Panam\u00e1 founded Club Ariel and\nCentro de Cultural Feminina, which supported intellectual and physical\neducation as well as the political life of women, and whose motto\ncentered on virtue and nationhood. In 1924, Visitaci\u00f3n Padilla\ndenounced the presence of U.S. marine military infantry in Honduras\nand Central America in the Bolet\u00edn de la Defensa\nNacional. She founded the C\u00edrculo de Cultura Femenina\nwhich supported the education of women and resisted North American\nmilitary intervention during the Second Honduran Civil War (1924). In\n1928, women of Ecuador sued the state, demanding the right to vote,\nand received it one year later (Gargallo 2004: 86).\n\nLuisa Capetillo (1879\u20131922) exemplifies the convergence of\nfeminist ideas and ideas concerning broader social transformation.\nBorn in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, Capetillo was home schooled and secured\na job as a reader in cigar-making factories, reading to workers and\ntransferring ideas to workers as they rolled cigars. Capetillo\u2019s\nemployment as a reader served as an important locale from which\nworkers developed a consciousness of trade unions, socialism,\nanarchism, and women\u2019s rights (Ruiz 2016: 6). Although readers\nwere typically men, it was not uncommon to find women in cigar\nfactories as the cigar-making industry modernized and became the\nsecond national industry in the first decades of the 20th\ncentury (Ramos 1992: 29). Hence, it is not accidental that some of the\nfirst feminist ideas of Puerto Rico emerged in cigar factories and in\nthe proletariat presses significantly before the suffrage movement\nlater in the century (Ramos 1992: 30). Capetillo\u2019s feminist\nideas are grounded in her class politics that saw emancipation\noccurring at the nexus between labor empowerment and gender equality\n(Ruiz 2016: 13). Although often heralded as the first feminist writer\nof Puerto Rico and the first woman to ever publish a book about women\nin Puerto Rico, Capetillo\u2019s work most importantly shows how\nearly 20th century Latin American feminist ideas and\nwriters were very much grounded in the lived material conditions of\ntheir times. In the case of Capetillo, her feminist anarchism brewed\nat the core of her understanding of workers\u2019 emancipation as a\nwoman who herself labored in the trenches of modernity.\n\nEarly 20th century Latin American feminist history\nconcludes with women\u2019s suffrage. The years spanning\n1870\u20131947 are generally considered the pivotal years for\nwomen\u2019s suffrage (Gargallo 2004: 94). However, to view this\nslice of history as merely centered on suffrage misrepresents the\nmultiplicity of feminist ideas and activities developed during the\ntime. These years also witnessed the push for social transformation\noriented around ideas of equality and justice that included, but was\nnot limited to, the right to vote. The push for equality framed\nwomen\u2019s insistence on public access to education, which impacted\nnot just women but the impoverished as well. The call for a more just\nsocial order framed how women were thinking about their locale in\nresistance to military intervention as well as labor movements. Hence,\nthe ideas that emanate from this period are multidimensional. The era\nis identified as closing out with the accomplishment of suffrage.\nHowever, the right to vote emerged at different times throughout the\nregion, owing to the diversity of local politics. For instance,\nEcuador was the first country in South America to enfranchise women in\n1929. That same year, Puerto Rico enfranchised literate women and in\n1935, gave the vote to all women. Uruguay followed shortly after in\n1932, Cuba in 1933, and El Salvador in 1939. However, the suffrage\nmovement stagnated in other countries: women were enfranchised in\nNicaragua and Per\u00fa in 1955, and only in 1961 did Paraguay give\nwomen the vote.\n\nIn the context of suffrage it is important to mention Uruguayan\nphilosopher Carlos Vaz Ferreira (1872-1958) and his treatise Sobre\nfemenismo (Vaz Ferreira 1933). Prior to the 1980's, Vaz Ferreria\nwas one of the only well known Latin American philosopher to discuss\nfeminism as part of the central corpus of his work (Schutte 1993:\n208). Sobre femenismo is a collection of  lectures\nVaz Ferreira delivered from 1914 to 1918, a pivotal time in the\nhistory of women\u2019s suffrage in Uruguay. The first printing of\nthe text in 1933 coincides with Uruguayan enfranchisement coinciding\nwith the climate of feminist social mobilization that began in\nthe early 1900\u2019s among socialists and sympathizers of feminism\namong the supporters of Batllismo (named after the then President Jose\nBatlle y Ordonez (Schutte 2003: 209). The Batllist\nmoment was favorable for intellectuals. They were public and esteemed\nroles with impact on social mores, and Vaz Ferreira was among these\n(Oliver 2007: 33). Sobre feminismo (1933) outlines a\nsocial theory of cooperation between men and women that privileged\nmonogamy, the family, and equitable division of household tasks\n(Oliver 2007: 34). Vaz Ferreira adopts a position he terms\nfeminism of compensation or compensatory feminism, which he\ndistinguishes from feminism of equality. Compensatory feminism held\nthat women are biologically disenfranchised in relation to men, but\nsociety can compensate for the disadvantage by adjusting institutional\nstructures (Schutte 2003: 209). Consequently, he was an takes up\nthe topics of women\u2019s suffrage, education, right to divorce\nas part of his political philosophy. \n1.3 The Years of Silence (1950\u20131970)\n\nCoined by Julieta Kirkwood of Chile as the \u201cyears of\nsilence\u201d, the years spanning from 1950\u20131970s/1980s saw\nwomen (mostly middle-class) increasing their political presence by\nparticipating in popular social movements and political parties\n(Kirkwood 1986: 70). However, their social and political participation\nlacked explicit feminist demands. Although not a strict set of dates,\nthe years of silence lasted well into the 1980s for some parts of\nLatin America (e.g., Chile); these years, the time of baby boom and\npopulism, were politically rife in post-World War II Latin America. It\nwas also a time characterized by McCarthyism which precipitated the\nU.S. intervention in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic with\nintentions of warding off communism (Gargallo 2004: 94). These years\nalso witnessed the fall of the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua in\n1956 as well the rise of conflict and military regimes in countries\nlike Colombia, Argentina, and Chile. Hence, political mobilization\ntook place around the changing landscape of Latin America, and\nmiddle-class women participated, but their explicit role in these\nmovements is complicated by the fact that their presence and impact\nwere not readily documented (Ungo Montenegro 2000: 45).\nNotwithstanding, the years of silence were not quiet on pages. Women\nduring these years were literarily active and produced texts that\nprivileged their position which was theoretically underappreciated\nbecause of their literary style (Gargallo 2004: 95).\n\nThe relationship between literature and philosophy has been explored\nas part of the Latin American philosophical tradition. For instance,\none position holds that the Latin American literary tradition of essay\nwriting contains insights that can ameliorate the troubles of Latin\nAmerican philosophy at large (Pereda 2006: 196). Nevertheless, the\npoints of literary departure for many Latin American philosophers are\nseldom women, although Latin American women in the middle of the\n20th century wrote amply about their identities in\nrelationship to gender, race, ethnicity, and nationality (Gargallo\n2004: 97). It is important to appreciate that not all women\u2019s\nwriting during this time pushed for social change. Some narratives\nplayed into patriarchy and machismo, forced marriage, and\nsocial isolation. At the same time, some women presented narratives\nthat exposed doubts and resistances to the patriarchal ordering of the\nworld (Gargallo 2004: 97). Unfortunately, women writers of this time\nare often folded into literary traditions, hindering their recognition\nas thinkers and theorists. One notable example is Rosario Castellanos\nof Mexico.\n\nIn 1950, at the age of 25, Castellanos defended her master\u2019s\nthesis in philosophy at Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de\nM\u00e9xico (UNAM). The project, titled Sobre cultura\nfeminina, explored women\u2019s role in the production of\nculture (Gargallo 2004: 89). She was a prolific writer. However,\nCastellanos is largely remembered as a literary figure and a poet. It\nwas not until 1974 (after her death), that the publication of her most\nfamous work El Eterno Feminino was recognized as\ntheoretically rich, speaking on themes of gender, ethnicity, and\nnationhood. Today, she is recognized as a leading voice in the\nfeminist movement of Mexico, her work arguing for the construction of\na feminine subjectivity that defies the identity imposed by\npatriarchal cultural norms. As a result, her work has aided in\nestablishing a different vision of political life for women in Mexico\n(Gargallo 2004: 90).\n\nThe 1950s\u20131970s was a fervent time of women\u2019s writing\nacross Latin America. Antonia Palacios of Venezuela wrote Ana\nIsabel, una ni\u00f1a decente (1949), Castellanos of Mexico\nwrote Bal\u00fan-Can\u00e1n (1957), and Albaluc\u00eda\n\u00c1ngel of Colombia wrote Estaba la p\u00e1jara pinta\nsentada un verde lim\u00f3n (1975). Further notable examples\ninclude the Mexican poet Enriqueta Ochoa whose published works span\n1947\u20132008 and Marvel Moreno, one of the most influential female\nwriters of Colombia. In the 1980s, Moreno broke through the literary\nmold of her times marked by the work of Gabriel Garc\u00eda Marquez\nwith the publication of Algo tan feo en la vida de una\nse\u00f1ora bien (1980). The protagonists of the book, who are\nwomen, serve as vehicles for the exploration of life in a patriarchal\nsociety. Moreno placed value on providing a genealogy of women as her\nprotagonists (e.g., the daughter, the mother, the grandmother),\nreflecting the importance of transgenerational communication amongst\nwomen. Thus, some argue her works provide a thematic thread of\nrebellion that runs through the lives of women and unites them in\ntheir histories of resistance to patriarchal social orders (Gargallo\n2004: 106).\n\nWhile dubbed the \u201cyears of silence\u201d, the work of women\nwriters during this period did find voice through literature and\npoetry. Their theoretical reflections were subsequently appreciated\nwith the resurgence of feminism in the later decades.\n1.4 Ideas of a Movement: Latin American Feminism of the Late 20th Century (1970s\u20131990s)\n\nThe years spanning the 1970s\u20131990s were marked with important\nsocial and political transformation for women in Latin America amidst\ncomplex political backdrops. Transitions from military regimes and\nprocesses of democratization as well as peace negotiations provide the\ncontext in which women\u2019s mobilization emerges across Latin\nAmerica. The plurality of political conditions gave way to the\ndevelopment of diverse feminist ideas. The feminism of this time, also\ncommonly referred to as neofeminism, was particularly attuned to the\nbody (Bartra 2001: 1). Grounded in the pre-1970 history of Latin\nAmerican feminism, neofeminism strove toward the validation of\nwomen\u2019s rights, but specifically centered on women\u2019s\nfreedom over their bodies. The neofeminist perspective translated into\nmobilizing on issues of abortion, motherhood, sexual autonomy, rape,\nand abuse (Bartra 2001: 1).\n\nContemporary Latin American feminism surged during politically somber\ntimes, especially under the presence of military regimes or nominal\ndemocracies that repressed civil liberties often in the name of\nnational security (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 397). Hence, as a\nsocial movement, Latin American feminism was born with an\nintrinsically oppositional and occasionally clandestine character\n(Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 397). As international organizations\nattempted to influence national health and population policies and\ngovernments to control women\u2019s bodies, the foci of Latin\nAmerican feminisms grew more complex (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992:\n403).\n\nOne notable characteristic of feminism during this time is the\nrecognition of womanhood as a shared status. Women during these\ndecades found identity in their status of womanhood and their shared\ncondition that differentiated them from men (Gargallo 2004: 88). They\nrejected \u201cman\u201d as the standard model around which their\npolitical action organized. The push for social and political\ntransformation focused less on equality (e.g., the right to vote) and\nmore on a desire for liberty, denying notions of femininity as\nsubordinate to masculinist constructions of humanity (Gargallo 2004:\n111). Latin American feminism of the late 20th century\nencouraged encounters between women that recognized them as subjects,\nwith their own histories, and on their own terms (Gargallo 2004:\n88).\n1.4.1 The 1970s\n\nAmid military regimes, the 1970s were characterized by a mobilization\nof women that took motherhood to be a political category. In some\ncountries, women resisted state repression as mothers of those who had\ndisappeared at the hands of the state (Gargallo 2004: 113). The\nCoMadres (Comit\u00e9 de Madres) of El Salvador formed in 1977 to\ninvestigate the disappearance of missing relatives. They photographed\nthe bodies of people found in the streets of El Salvador in order to\naid in identification. In the same year, the Asociaci\u00f3n Madres\nde Plaza de Mayo in Argentina organized as mothers to search for their\ndisappeared children as a result of state terrorism enacted by the\nmilitary dictatorship that spanned the years of 1976\u20131983. In\nMexico, critical stances on motherhood were initiated by the\nneofeminist group Mujeres en Acci\u00f3n Solidaria (MAS), which\nprotested the sanctifying myth of motherhood on the eve of\nMother\u2019s Day at El Monumento a la Madre (a monument honoring\nmothers) in Mexico City. They resisted the myth that a woman\u2019s\nrole in society should be circumscribed to motherhood\n(Guti\u00e9rrez 2012: 42). The protest continued in the years that\nfollowed.\n\nThe push to disconnect motherhood from womanhood set the stage for a\nseparation between the reproductive capacities of women\u2019s bodies\nand their sexual health (Gargallo 2004: 114). Claims to the\ndecriminalization of abortion emerged under access to reproductive\nrights that sought to give women control over their own bodies. Thus,\nthe right to abort was defended on the grounds of a woman\u2019s\nright to individual autonomy (Gargallo 2004: 114). In 1976, El\nMovimiento Nacional de Mujeres, along with other autonomous feminist\ngroups, organized one of the first congresses on the decriminalization\nof abortion that maintained the interruption of pregnancy as a\nwoman\u2019s decision that should be made accessible through all\ninstitutions of public health (Gargallo 2004: 114). In the years that\nfollowed, feminists in Mexico used a variety of symbolic strategies in\ntheir fight for the legalization of abortion. They dressed in black to\npublicly mourn the women who had died as a result of clandestine\nabortions (Garagallo 2004: 115). Today, abortion remains tiered in\naccess throughout Latin America. Countries such as Chile, Nicaragua,\nDominican Republic, and El Salvador prohibit abortion entirely, even\nunder conditions where it would save a woman\u2019s life. In\ncountries like Mexico, Guatemala, Panam\u00e1, and Venezuela\nabortion is legal only under conditions where it saves the life of the\nwoman. However, in countries like Argentina, Costa Rica, and Ecuador\nabortion is legal to the extent that it preserves the physical health\nof the woman. In some countries, conditions of rape are understood as\npart of the preservation of physical health (e.g., Argentina), while\nin others, the extension is made to allow abortion to the extent that\nit preserves the mental health of the woman (e.g., Colombia). Cuba,\nUruguay, and Puerto Rico are places that have legalized abortion\nwithout any restrictions that would require some particular reason.\nAlthough the battle for access to abortion began during the 1970s, it\ncontinues to be a contested political issue especially in places where\naccess is entirely denied or restricted by other factors: physical\nhealth, mental health, or life preservation. Moreover, in places like\nPuerto Rico, the question of abortion is intricately bound up with\nhistories of forced sterilization, making the issue more politically\ncharged and complex.\n\nAs a time characterized by state repression, the 1970s were also a\ntime of awakening for many women who demanded social change (Bartra\n2001: 6). Latin American feminists not only challenged patriarchy by\ndefining themselves as distinct political subjects, but also\nchallenged male paradigms of domination expressed through the\nmilitaristic and counter-insurgent state. The reality of state\nrepression made Latin American feminisms distinct in their ability to\nunveil the patriarchal foundations of militarism and institutionalized\nviolence (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 397). The intimate\nrelationship between patriarchy and military state repression is best\nelucidated by the intersection between Chilean feminist activism and\nthe push for democratization in Julieta Kirkwood\u2019s famous\nphrase: \u201cDemocracia en el pa\u00eds, en la casa y en la\ncama\u201d, which translates to: \u201cDemocracy in the nation, in\nthe house, and in the bed\u201d (Kirkwood 1986: 14). Latin American\nfeminism of the 1970s was linked to an activism that believed\nauthoritarian regimes found their roots where patriarchal oppression\ntrickled into the \u201cprivate\u201d sphere. By the late 1970s,\nopposition movements emerged throughout Latin America, joined by women\nfrom all walks of life defying their historical exclusion from\npolitical life (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 398\u2013399).\n\nThe heterogeneity of contemporary Latin American feminism can be\ntraced to the diverse political conditions from which its activism\nemerged. Nevertheless, a theme can be found in the commitment to\nchange the social relations of production, including reproduction.\nThroughout the region, women collectively participated in movements to\nengender human rights by seeking better access to education,\nhealthcare, and urban services as well as resistance to military state\nrepression (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 401). Latin America\u2019s\neconomic dependence and political repression during these years set\nthe stage for a distinct militant feminist activism that would\ncontinue to spread into the decade of the 1980s.\n1.4.2 The 1980s\n\nThe 1980s were characterized by the expansion of feminist theory and\npractice. Feminists started focusing on specialized activities that\ndeepened their vision of politics, culture, and society. The number of\nfeminist magazines, films, and video collectives increased.\nFurthermore, the number of centers for rape victims and abused women,\nas well as feminist health collectives, lesbian groups, and other\nspecifically gendered projects grew during this time (Saporta\nSternbach et al. 1992: 404). As feminists increased their activities\nin feminist projects, they began creating more civil society\norganizations or NGO\u2019s (non-government organizations)\n(Mill\u00e1n 2014: 154).\n\nOne of the most important events to mark the 1980s was the first\nEncuentro Feminista Latinoamericano y del Caribe held in\nBogot\u00e1, Colombia. The Encuentros (\u201cEncounters\u201d), as\nthey came to be called in short, served as regional critical forums\nfor debates about feminist politics and the movement\u2019s overall\nrelationship to social justice in Latin America and the Caribbean. The\nattendees of the First Encuentro came together on the heels of\ngeographic and political isolation with a desire to carve out a path\nfor autonomous politics. Over the years, the Encuentros extended the\nmap of feminist politics (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 405).\n\nThe First Encuentro convened in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, over the\ncourse of four days in July 1981; more than two hundred women from\nover fifty organizations attended. The region-wide gathering brought\ntogether many strands of feminism, creating a heterogeneous movement\nwith considerable tensions and conflicts. For instance, during the\nplanning stages of the meeting, heated discussions emerged between\nindependent/autonomous feminists, often identified as\naut\u00f3nomas or feministas, and militant\npolitical feminists affiliated with political parties (e.g.,\nsocialist), often referred to as militantes. Independent\nfeminists expressed concern over the possibility that feminists\naligned with political parties might try to impose sectarian agendas\ndiverting attention from issues central to feminist organizing (e.g.,\nreproductive rights) (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 407).\n\nThe most widely attended Encuentro of 1981, \u201cFeminism and\nPolitical Struggle\u201d, focused on the autonomy of the feminist\nmovement, double militancy (concurrent participation in a political\nparty and the feminist movement), and feminism and imperialism\n(Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 408). The response to the session\nexemplified the diversity of ideas involved in the feminist struggle.\nAll of the participants agreed that women suffer a specific oppression\nby virtue of their womanhood, which is exacerbated by class. Their\nagreement translated into particular demands: equal pay, end of the\ndouble workday, and the right to safe abortion as well as the right to\nchoose motherhood (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 408). Furthermore,\nit was clear that the political parties of the time across the region\nwere not centered on these demands in their claims for social change.\nTwo notable positions were developed in response to the session. The\nfirst position maintained that neither capitalism nor socialism on\ntheir own could end women\u2019s oppression. Women\u2019s liberation\nneeded to be articulated outside the networks of party-affiliated\nactivism that would make demands for complete social transformation to\nalter oppressive relations. They held that severing the\nmilitante and the feminista was to misunderstand\nfeminist politics, which is a comprehensive political praxis. The\nfocus of feminist political activism needed to be in targeted feminist\norganizations, since the revolutionary Left tended to place men in the\ncenter (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 409). The second position held\nthat feminism on its own could not be revolutionary because of its\ninherent commitment to socialism. They thought feminism should be an\norganic outgrowth of socialist struggles that could not be separated\nfrom struggles against class oppression. Double militancy, on this\nview, was a practical difficulty, but one that could be overcome\n(Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 409).\n\nThe 1981 Encuentro reflected the larger social and political\nconditions out of which Latin American feminisms were evolving. The\nconflict between the feministas and the militantes\nexemplified the divergences in Latin American feminisms during the\n1980s. However, it also reflected the genesis of Latin American\nfeminist ideas in women\u2019s political activism. So, although mired\nin conflict, the Encuentros signaled the intimate ties between ideas\nregarding gender struggle and the political conditions that give rise\nto those ideas.\n\nThe Second Encuentro, held in Lima, Per\u00fa in July 1983,\nthematically focused on patriarchy, a controversial topic\ngiven its association with imperialist American and European\nfeminisms. The Encuentro reflected a shift in feminist claims,\nidentifying that sexism was not just an outcome of capitalism, but\nrather shaped by a patriarchal sex/gender system that functioned\nautonomously (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 412). Moreover, the\nSecond Encuentro experienced a public response to the visibility of\nlesbian identity within Latin American feminisms, forcing many\nheterosexual women to confront their homophobia (Saporta Sternbach et\nal. 1992: 412). The meeting also pushed the topic of racism, which\nresurfaced in subsequent years both in the Encuentros and the larger\nlandscape of Latin American feminist ideas that launched staunch\ncritiques on the omission of race and racism from dominant feminist\nconversations.\n\nThe growth of the Encuentros testified to the growth of feminisms\nthroughout the region. The Fourth Encuentro held in Taxco, Mexico\n(1987) brought together 1,500 women. As the end of the decade was\nnearing, the Fourth Encuentro reflected increased complexity in Latin\nAmerican feminist politics, which was made palpable by the recurrence\nof the question: \u201cWho is a feminist?\u201d (Saporta Sternbach\net al. 1992: 421). The discussion reflected divergences in what\nconstituted feminist politics and whether general community organizing\nwas sufficient to characterize feminist organizing, particularly where\ncommunity groups were controlled by the church or local political\nparties (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 421). Nevertheless, a key\npoint remains that when the Encuentros began in 1981, feminism was\nstill a \u201cdirty word\u201d, but by 1987, feminism had gained\nlegitimacy and was validated in Leftist political circles, notably in\nthe Nicaraguan revolution (Saporta Sternbach et al. 1992: 421). The\nEncuentros continued to demonstrate the diverse growth of Latin\nAmerican feminisms as a thriving and expansive map of ideas grounded\nin different strands of political activism. Although the Encuentros\ncontinue to the present day, the Encuentros of the 1980s were\nsignificant developments which reflected an evolving social movement\nwith tense but important relationships among revolutionary struggles,\nfeminist goals, and claims for social justice.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s, as the HIV/AIDS epidemic peaked, sexual\npolitics became increasingly conservative. Sex, once viewed as a\npolitical act that could blur the private/public divide and subvert\ntraditional gender roles, became fraught with difficulty. Young\nfeminists came of age at a time when sexual education shifted toward\nnarratives of the risks of sex and not its disruptive political\npotential (Gargallo 2004: 123\u2013124). Furthermore, the closing of\nthe decade saw the continued linking between feminism and NGOs that\nwould be characteristic of the institutionalization of feminism in the\n1990s. For some, institutionalization entailed de-radicalization of\nfeminist politics in Latin America and the Caribbean (Gargallo 2004:\n125).\n1.4.3 The 1990s\n\nLatin American feminisms during the 1990s are characterized by a focus\non gender equality and non-discrimination within the confines of\ninstitutions governed by neoliberal policies (Coba & Herrera 2013:\n18). As a result, they are referred to as liberal feminisms not\ngrounded in resistance, but rather in their adaptation to a neoliberal\ninfrastructure that was ushered in throughout the region.\nNeoliberalism had a distinct impact on women\u2019s activism and the\ndevelopment of feminist ideas. Women were one of the most affected\ngroups with the shifts in economic policies, and the phrase\n\u201cfeminization of poverty\u201d accurately captured the\ndetrimental impact on women\u2019s lives. Many women joined the\nmenial labor force (e.g., maquilas, agricultural labor)\nwithout any labor rights or access to fair wages (Gargallo 2004:\n117).\n\nAt the same time, feminist activists started coupling their efforts\nwith organizations that targeted policy change in favor of women and\noperated with a distinct language about violence, health, and human\nrights in tune with liberal politics (Gargallo 2004: 125). The concept\nof the autonomous individual reigned as the explanatory framework for\ndevelopment. Under the umbrella of individuality, people were\nresponsible for their own survival and development which were\ndependent on their initiative in a market economy (Coba & Herrera\n2013: 18). In this context, the activist politics that had once\ncharacterized feminist organizing shifted to less radicalized\norganizational institutions. A substantial portion of the feminist\nmovement that transitioned to institutions did so without critiquing\neconomic policies and neoliberalism (Bastian Duarte 2012: 157).\nInstitutionalized feminists started working alongside governments and\nagencies, which prioritized change in public policy but did not seek\nto investigate the roots of inequality that justified the need for\npolicy change. Moreover, conditions emerged where NGO\u2019s were\nable to offer specialized resources for women. In doing so, they\npromoted far-reaching gender discourse that was standardized with the\nuniversalizing criteria of the United Nations. With their hands tied\nby donors, these organizations were not necessarily mindful of the\npriorities of local organizations or their populations (Bastian Duarte\n2012: 157). As a result, the infrastructure of institutionalization\nexacerbated existing power imbalances across ethnic and class\nlines.\n\nAmong the institutions participating in the institutionalization of\nfeminisms was the academy. From the late 1980s well into the 1990s,\nwomen\u2019s studies programs started organizing throughout\nuniversities. Moreover, the study of feminist philosophy more broadly\nstarted finding its way into curricula as the activism of earlier\ndecades pressured universities to support women\u2019s and gender\nstudies (Schutte & Femen\u00edas 2010: 400). The decade marked\nthe professionalization of feminism. Feminism, which had once been an\norienting force of activism, became employable and profitable (Bartra\n2001: 11). However, this is not to discredit the tremendous effort\nthat the development of university programs required. As university\nprograms became institutional fixtures, they also served as\ncounter-hegemonic spaces where resistance could be facilitated.\n\nThe 1990s also saw the initiation of journals and formal publications.\nIn 1990, Debate Feminista was launched by Marta Lamas. It\nremains one of the most impactful journal publications on intellectual\nfeminisms. In 1991, La Correa Feminista was created to bring\ntogether the thoughts of autonomous and radical feminists. It ran\nuntil 1998 when the editors self-assessed the journal\u2019s goals\nand decided to launch Creatividad Feminista, an online\npublication which ran until 2008, when its daughter site,\nMamaMetal, was created. Finally, La Doble Jornada\nsprang as a feminist supplement to La Jornada, Mexico\u2019s\nleading Leftist newspaper, and ran from 1986\u20131998 (Mill\u00e1n\n2014: 156).\n\nDuring this time, Latin American feminisms began to privilege the use\nof the category gender or the gender perspective\nover patriarchy as the conceptual framework from which to\ntalk about the situation of women. The shift to using language of\ngender is largely owed to the importation of North American\nfeminist ideas. In the Latin American context, Gayle Rubin\u2019s\nwork received substantial attention as evidenced by numerous\ntranslations as well as by extensive commentary on its complex\nunderstanding of the sex/gender system (Gargallo 2004: 21). However,\nit is important to note that the term was already being deployed by\nscholars and carried with it a variety of connotations (Schutte 1998b:\n88).\n\nGender was translated to Spanish as\n\u201cg\u00e9nero\u201d, which to many was a poor translation.\nG\u00e9nero, which translates to English as\n\u201cspecies\u201d or \u201ckind\u201d, traveled to the Latin\nAmerican context via academic publishing and sparked debate on its\naptness to map onto the feminist conditions of the region. The gender\nperspective, which employs the paradigm of radical individualism\ncharacteristic of the decade, comes to stand alongside the concept of\nempowerment as one that can specifically target women\u2019s needs.\nThe language of gender and empowerment was used by the United Nations\nas part of their universalizing goals for women during the 1995 World\nConference on Women held in Beijing, a moment which marked mounted\ntensions around the de-politicization of Latin American feminisms\n(Bastian Duarte 2012: 157).\n\nThe use of the themes of gender and empowerment was further deployed\nby newly democratized states. Feminist activists found themselves in a\ndifferent relationship to the state as it adopted the language of\ngender. Once a vehicle of repression, especially under\nmilitary rule, Latin American feminists now had to contend with a\ndrastically different engagement with the role of the state, one that\nhad co-opted the very terms of a movement that was initiated in\nopposition to its repression. Newly formed liberal democracies\nunderstood women as potential markets for modernizing and development,\nthus deploying the language of gender and empowerment (Alvarez 1998:\n271). However, the way in which the state managed poverty as part of\nits modernizing mission was mired in individualism with little focus\non communities.\n\nPolitical and economic transitions influenced the development of\nfeminist ideas. Activism became institutionalized and the feminist\nmovement grew in various directions. As the 90s came to a close, what\nstarted out as a spontaneous social movement with radical ideas about\npatriarchy, militarism, and democratization found its way into the\nhalls of institutions and organizations that stifled feminist\nactivism. The institutionalization of feminism was so profound that\nits political promise seemed lost. However, as the opening of the\n21st century demonstrates, this was not the case.\nInstitutionalization was not without critique, and the early 2000s\nmarked the emergence of new voices that took liberal dominant\nfeminisms to task by focusing on anti-neoliberal and decolonial\ncritique which began to call out the hegemonic practices of Latin\nAmerican feminisms.\n1.5 Dissident Voices: Latin American Feminist Ideas of the 21st Century\n\nThe institutionalization of feminism came under scrutiny in the 2000s.\nAutonomous feminists argued that as feminist practices continued to\nnormalize, they failed to account for the inequities among women. As\nthe century came to a close, critiquing (marginal) voices emerged,\narguing that liberal feminism tended to overlook difference, inequity,\nand exclusion amongst women located in vastly different social and\ncultural locations (Coba & Herrera 2013: 18). The Eighth Encuentro\n(November 1999) held in Juan Dolio, Dominican Republic, reflected the\npresence of these emerging voices as dominant feminisms\u2019\n\u201cOthers\u201d: Indigenous women, Afro-descended women, and\nlesbians whose position relative to the Encuentros had been marginal.\nThe claims of inclusivity and diversity of the Encuentros were brought\nunder critical scrutiny as they argued that their identities had been\nobscured under liberal feminism, which took gender to be\ncharacteristic of a foundational unity for the encounters. These\ndesencuentros (\u201cdisencounters\u201d) formed the basis\nof new social and political critique that characterized the emerging\nvoices.\n\nIn response to the neoliberal shifts of the 80s and 90s, the early\n21st century brought with it an anti-neoliberal discourse\nto Latin American feminisms that was further fed by decolonial and\nanti-patriarchal stances. Amongst these were positions that argued for\nthe decolonization of universal feminism by taking into account the\naxes of race, ethnicity, and sexuality in the articulations of\nidentity. The 2000s were also marked by an attempt to dry out the\ninstitutionalization of gender. At the same time, there has not been\nan impetus to reconfigure a social movement in the wake of neoliberal\nshifts (Coba & Herrera 2013: 19).\n\nWe are currently witnessing an emergence of ideas that is starting to\nreshape how we think about Latin American feminisms. However, the\nproject of reconfiguration is still very much in process. In this\ncontext, critical ideas about race and the history of racism have\nentered mainstream concerns, predominantly voiced from Afro-descended\nstandpoints (Curiel 2007). Further, lesbian feminists have brought\nforth criticisms of liberal feminism for not only paying less\nattention to race and racism, but also for centering on\nheteronormativity as part of the feminist agenda. One notable position\nholds that there is an inextricable link between lesbianism and\nfeminism insofar as the adoption of a self-conscious feminism entails\nshifting engagement with dominant masculinity on all levels and this\nincludes the realm of desire (Espinosa Mi\u00f1oso 2011: 403).\nIndigenous feminists have also uncovered critical insights in the\nrelationships among community, the state, and political belonging.\nTheir ideas about the balance between ethnic belonging and critiques\nof sexism are a call to dominant liberal feminism to rethink its\nconcept of culture and community that risks reducing Indigenous women\nto targets of development (Bastian Duarte 2012: 164). The emergence of\nthese critical ideas takes liberal feminism to task by calling out the\ndominance of middle-class, white/mestiza, and heteronormative\nmodels for feminist projects as not only exclusionary, but also\nprofoundly harmful. Notably, most of these positions take\ndecolonization as an orienting project and maintain that racism and\nheterosexism are rooted in colonialism whose impact continues to\nplague Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nIn 2007, GLEFAS (Grupo Latinoamericano de Estudio, Formac\u00edon y\nAcci\u00f3n Feminista) was founded with the intention of creating a\nspace for dialogue within the lesbian and feminist movement in Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean as well as with other social and land\nstruggle movements in the region. They self-describe as seeking to\nproduce political analysis from an anti-racist, anti-military,\nanti-colonial, anti-capitalist, lesbian feminist perspective. In line\nwith their philosophical vision, they published Tejiendo de otro\nmodo: Feminismo, epistemolog\u00eda y apuestas decoloniales en Abya\nYala (2014b) as an outgrowth of a colloquium held in Chapel Hill,\nNorth Carolina in 2012. The book brings together a diverse group of\ncontemporary voices that intervene on hegemonic understandings of\nfeminism in the region in order to make room for a collective that\nappreciates the diversity of knowledges. Speaking from the margins,\nthe book takes as its central claim that decolonization is concomitant\nwith de-patriarchialization. Hence, it reflects a shift in\ncontemporary Latin American feminist writings that are paving the way\nfor critical considerations of capitalism, imperialism, democracy, and\nidentity. These new voices of dissent are changing the landscape of\nLatin American feminisms with unique ideas that call for rethinking\nwhat it means to be a feminist today.\n2. Key Issues and Debates\n2.1 Latin American Feminist Autonomy\n\nAutonomy is a foundational, albeit contested, concept in\nLatin American feminisms. It is a foundational concept to the extent\nthat feminist identity has hinged on the conceptualization of\nautonomy. However, how autonomy is defined has been widely debated as\nthe term has been deployed in varying capacities. Autonomy has been\nused conceptually to forge alliances between women\u2019s groups in\nLatin America that seek to eradicate gender-based oppression. It has\nalso been used to avoid co-option by actors like political parties,\nNGO\u2019s, the state, and funding agencies. The result is a tension\nbetween the retention of ideological and financial autonomy and the\nwidening of feminisms\u2019 scope and impact. Thus, the varying use\nof autonomy calls into question how it is being defined (Alvarez et\nal. 2003: 542).\n\nThe history of feminist autonomy in Latin American feminism is rooted\nin the activism of the 1970s and 1980s where it was invoked in\nopposition to militant feminists (militantes) involved with\nthe political parties of the Left. Autonomy, in this context, was\ndefined as independence from any organization that understood the\nfight for women\u2019s liberation as a secondary goal. On the other\nside stood those who took the fight for revolutionary social change as\nconcurrent with feminist involvement and advocated for double\nparticipation (Alvarez et al. 2003: 543). The rise of the political\nLeft in many Latin American countries involved resistance to political\nregimes, and the question of where dedication was rooted reflected the\nrelationship between feminism and the possibilities for social change.\nFeminist activism revealed the way in which the negotiation of\nautonomy was and continues to be an evolving concept. As the 1980s\nprogressed with their shifting political landscape, the idea of\nautonomous feminism came to be redundant. Hence, an understanding of\nengaged autonomy emerged, which maintained the importance of retaining\na feminist stance while negotiating or participating in social\npractice (Alvarez et al. 2003: 543).\n\nThe concept of autonomy surfaced throughout the Encuentros that\nspanned the 1970s\u20131990s and further illuminated the question of\ninclusion. If being autonomous entailed commitments to women\u2019s\nliberation, being autonomous also signaled participation in a feminist\nproject. However, it is contestable what the criteria of inclusion\nunder the label of feminism was. As Latin American feminisms underwent\ninstitutionalization, two logics characterized the problem of\ninclusion.\n\nThe policy-advocacy logic argued for promoting feminist-influenced\ngender policy through governmental or non-governmental organizations.\nOn the other hand, the identity-solidarity logic distanced itself from\nformal institutions and remained centered on women\u2019s movements\nthrough the development of feminist ideas in community and politics\n(Alvarez et al. 2003: 548). However, neither one of these necessarily\nentailed the inclusion of all women as is demonstrated by contemporary\ncritiques of the hegemonic practices of Latin American feminisms that\nfailed to pay attention to the importance of race, class, ethnicity,\nand sexuality in shaping subordination (Alvarez et al. 2003: 565).\nCutting across these logics is the way in which inclusion in feminism\nis contingent upon practice. How autonomy is understood hinges upon an\nunderstanding of feminist practice, and those practices are shaped by\ndynamics of inclusion and exclusion. Eventually, autonomy would be\nre-defined through individual and collective commitment to the\ntransformation of women\u2019s lives and society as a whole (Alvarez\net al. 2003: 557). At present, there is not a settled definition of\nfeminist autonomy, but rather a pluralism of understanding that tracks\na variety of proposals for understanding feminist engagement and\npractices.\n2.2 The Politics of Translation and Location\n\nAttention to North-South hemispheric relations has been one key\ntheoretical issue of Latin American feminism reflected in the ample\nscholarship on the migration of ideas. Latin American feminisms, much\nlike Latin American philosophy, have shown concern over the\nauthenticity of ideas that have traveled from epistemic centers (e.g.,\nthe United States, Europe). However, unlike Latin American philosophy,\nLatin American feminisms have responded to this concern by developing\ntheories that attend to dynamics with which ideas travel and the way\nin which ideas are re-negotiated and re-signified as they move across\nlocations. Generally, the claims about the ways in which ideas are\nreconfigured as they enter new contexts emerge over concerns about the\ntravel of ideas in a North-South direction, which not only remains\nnon-reciprocal, but further signals the centrality of North America\nand Europe as the centers of knowledge production. Latin American\nfeminisms have critically argued against the general understanding\nthat ideas are formed in the \u201cNorth\u201d and travel to the\n\u201cSouth\u201d (Connell 2014). In order to defend this position,\nit is argued that the act of translating is itself a materially\nsituated political task that re-signifies ideas as they migrate into\nvarying contexts. The ideas that emerge in the Latin American context\nare themselves unique to the circumstances that generate their\nconditions of articulation. However, circumstance is not sufficient to\ncreate uniqueness; rather, the processes of translation involved in\nthe movement of ideas across hemispheres shift meaning.\n\nTranslation can be understood as any act of description,\ninterpretation, or dissemination. It is always caught up in power\nrelations that are configured by the asymmetries between people,\nlanguages, and regions (Lima Costa 2014a: 20). In the context of the\nAmericas, the movement of ideas occurs across asymmetrical power\nrelations. Ideas encounter roadblocks and migratory checkpoints as\nthey attempt to cross borders (Lima Costa 2014a: 21). As a result,\ndialogue across hemispheres mirrors asymmetries of power and has led\nto the mistaken notion that nothing originates from the Global South,\nbut rather is only imported into the region from the Global North.\nTranslation is made further complex by \u201ctheory brokers\u201d\n(e.g., academics, donors, feminist NGO\u2019s) that mediate the\nmovement of ideas (Lima Costa 2014a: 25). As ideas move, their\nmeanings shift, and their transformation is contingent on the culture\nor discipline that receives them (Lima Costa 2014a: 29). Hence,\ndiscursive migration is not neutral, and in the process, location\ncomes to frame how to understand the reconfiguration of ideas.\nThinking about translation through the matrix of discursive migration\nilluminates the way in which difference and power play a crucial role\nin how knowledge becomes legitimated across difference.\n\nPlacing translation at the center of feminist practices recognizes\nthat translation is both politically and theoretically indispensable\nfor feminist, anti-racist, decolonial, and anti-imperial alliances\n(Alvarez 2014: 1). Translation is framed as a translocal phenomenon\ninsofar as it does not involve a fixed location, but further links\ngeographies of power (e.g., national, local) with subject positions\n(e.g., gender/sexual, ethnoracial) (Alvarez 2014: 2). In this\nconceptual space, Latin America and the Caribbean are configured with\na heterogeneity of Latinidades within the United States and\nwithin Latin America and the Caribbean that exist and move across\nmultiple border spaces (Alvarez 2014: 2). Identities are formed in the\nnexus between borders, the spaces of intense confluence that\ncharacterize transmigrations across the region.\n\nSubjectivity is both place-based and mis- or displaced with the\nmovement of ideas. In this context, difference emerges as a rich\nterrain from which to engage others. For some, the difference that\nmediates speaking positions is always characterized by degrees of\nincommensurability as we can never be fully transparent with each\nother across conditions of alterity. However, the condition of\nincommensurability is not sufficient to abandon translation, but\nrather an imperative to hear others in and across their difference\n(Schutte 1998a: 61).\n\nOne method of navigating the conditions of incommensurability is\nrecognizing the complexity and diversity of speaking positions with\nwhich we engage. The term transloca has been argued to aid in\nelucidating such complexities of difference. Embodying both the\nprocesses of translation (\u201ctrans\u201d) and the\nmaterial effects of location (\u201cloca\u201d), the\ntransloca highlights multiple dimensions that shape\nconditions of difference (Alvarez 2014: 4). Following the claims about\ntranslocation, transloca as a subject position attends to the\nmovement of bodies, text, capital, and theory along the North-South\naxis as they produce new epistemologies for apprehending the\nglobalizing Americas (Alvarez 2014: 4). Translocas are\nworld-traveling translators, cultural and political mediators, and\nhence also agents of transculturation (Alvarez 2014: 8). The term is\nintended to illuminate the way in which subjectivity is forged in and\nthrough movement across hemispheres mediated by location and\ntranslation. Attending to the dimensions of hemispheric movement\nelucidates the conditions of alterity that generate\nincommensurability, but also puts into focus the way translation\nmediates the processes of identity formation.\n\nThe arguments in regard to discursive migration, translation, and\ntranslocas further capture the links among Latin America, the\nCaribbean, and the United States as part of an intertwined diaspora\n(Alvarez 2014: 7). The intertwining is one that stretches in many\nhemispheric directions and as a result, makes Latin/a America a\nheterogeneous epistemic horizon. From Latinas in the United States to\nAfro-Latinas in Latin America, the ideas produced at the borders and\nnexus between, in, and through hemispheres are best understood by\nappreciating practices of translation. Hence, to think through Latin/a\nAmerica as an epistemic locale, in its multidimensionality, requires a\npolitics of translation that can foster coalition-building across\nhemispheres in spite of alterity. If taken seriously, feminist\ntheories of translation demonstrate that ideas are products of\nhemispheric locations, incommensurable with their predecessors (local\nor imported). The discourses produced in Latin America and the\nCaribbean are not only alternative reconfigurations of ideas, but also\nruptures in political epistemic practices. They call into question the\nnotion that knowledge production is a naturalized feature of\nparticular places (Femen\u00edas 2007: 14). Thus, the traffic of\nideas generates new and diverse spaces from which to think about\nlocations of difference (Femen\u00edas 2007: 15).\n2.3 Gender in Hemispheric Context\n\nAnother key debate that has emerged as a part of the broader Latin\nAmerican feminist conversation on the politics of translation has been\nover the use of the term gender, which, as previously noted,\nentered the hemispheric frame with the translation of Gayle\nRubin\u2019s scholarship into Spanish. The term was translated into\nSpanish as g\u00e9nero, whose direct translation is more\nakin to \u201cgenre\u201d or \u201cspecies\u201d. Latin American\nfeminists have contested the legitimacy of gender as a\ncategory of feminist analysis (Schutte & Femen\u00edas 2010:\n403).\n\nPrior to the introduction of the term gender, feminists most\nreadily used the concept of patriarchy because it offered a\nframework grounded in ideological and socioeconomic conditions that\nallowed for articulating the cause of women\u2019s oppression\n(Schutte & Femen\u00edas 2010: 403). In many ways,\npatriarchy served as a glue of consciousness-raising in late\n20th century women\u2019s movements of Latin America,\nhelping connect women by identifying their shared subordinate status\nunder conditions of patriarchy.\n\nDuring the Second Encuentro in 1982 (Lima, Per\u00fa)\npatriarchy was declared the foundational category from which\nLatin American feminists sought to understand their realities. It was\ndeployed as an explanation for the subordination of women, but also\nextended as an explanation for the conditions of compulsory\nheterosexuality, repression, violence against women and children, the\nprohibition of abortion, and varying forms of social injustice\n(Gargallo 2004: 92). It was further linked into frameworks that sought\nto identify the role of militarization and capitalism in the\noppression of women. Hence, it provided a methodological frame from\nwhich to articulate claims about power, oppression, and domination\nthat united women on many fronts. Patriarchy was a conceptual\nstronghold of Latin American feminism akin to what imperialism was to\nnational liberation struggles (Gargallo 2004: 92). It was\nexplanatorily powerful because it could account for complex realities\nwhile also providing an explanation for the shared experiences of\nwomen. Unfortunately, the explanatory power of the term was so\nexpansive that it rendered historical specificities opaque since\nnothing could exist at its margins (Gargallo 2004: 92).\n\nReplacing the focus on patriarchy, the gender\nperspective (\u201cperspectiva de g\u00e9nero\u201d) or\ngender focus (\u201cenfoque de g\u00e9nero\u201d) became\nthe methodological framework from which to talk about women and\nwomen\u2019s issues across Latin America. Woman was replaced\nas a foundational category by gender, which became a blanket\nterm so user-friendly that anyone could use it as a referent to\nwomen\u2019s issues (Schutte & Femen\u00edas 2010: 404). The\nease with which it was used entailed the softening of radical militant\ncritiques of patriarchy that had characterized feminist\ntheorization in earlier decades. Gender was incorporated into\npublic policy and social programs by state and intergovernmental\norganizations, reflecting the way in which it could be taken up as\npart of the lexicon for even policies not feminist-inspired (Lima\nCosta 2014a: 26). On the flip side, the Vatican during its preparation\nfor the 1995 Conference on Women feared using the word gender\nas it might entail the acceptance of homosexuality, the destruction of\nthe patriarchal family, and the dissemination of feminism (Lima Costa\n2014a: 28).\n\nAlthough the movement of gender across hemispheres is far\nfrom complete, it is important to recognize the way in which the\ntraffic of gender took place in and through material\nconditions. One notable method of translating and migrating concepts\nis through academic journals, and the debates on the uses of\ngender have revealed broader reflections on how concepts come\nto carry epistemic weight. The transnational citational market is one\nkey dimension in this process as who gets cited, where, and by whom\nexposes the routes through which theories have traveled in global\ncontexts (Lima Costa 2014b: 142). In light of the conceptual travel\nand use of gender, Latin American feminisms ask that one\nconsider the way in which the global privileging of English as the\nlinguistic medium impacts what knowledge is allowed to circulate (Lima\nCosta 2014b: 142). Moreover, these reflections bring to the fore the\nfact that English cannot be viewed as a transparent medium as its\nprivileged status sets the stage for what gets taken up as worth\ntranslating in the first place. It should then be no surprise that\ngender has traveled so far. Its traffic is a marker of the\nimperative to create conditions for productive\n\u201cmis-translations\u201d that create spaces for heterogeneous\nconceptual development (Lima Costa 2014b: 144).\n2.4 Negotiating Complex Identities\n\nAlthough gender has been a key focus of analysis, Latin\nAmerican feminist thought has also concentrated on the importance of\naccounting for the complexity of identity. Conceptually,\ngender on its own is insufficient to account for the\ncomplexities of identity. Notably, Latin American feminisms have paid\nattention to the ways in which class, race/ethnicity, and sexuality\nare necessary components for understanding the lived experience of\nidentity, which is never conceptualized as pure nor one-dimensional\n(Fem\u00e9nias 2007: 16).\n\nThe idea that class is a key dimension of women\u2019s lives is one\nthat is rooted in Latin American feminist activisms of the late\n19th and early 20th centuries. As previously\nnoted in Section 1 (on the history of Latin American feminism),\nwomen\u2019s fights for equality of this time were framed in terms of\nequitable access to social goods (e.g., education). The impact of this\npush was the transformation of the material lives of people living in\npoverty more generally. Considerations of the importance of class\nconditions in understanding the plight of women and the poor have been\nlong rooted in Latin American feminist ideas. Feminist projects\nconcerned with the advancement of women in civil society converged\nwith labor movements and anti-imperial resistance (e.g., Luisa\nCapetillo). This trend re-emerged during resistance movements of the\n1970s that aligned feminist projects with revolutionary parties of the\nLeft across Latin America. As a result, attention to class dimensions\nhas long been part of the feminist methodology. However, this\nattention has not been without fault. Contemporary theories from the\nwork of Afro-descended women have argued that the overwhelming\nattention paid to class has come at the expense of analyzing the role\nthat racism has played in the marginalization and exclusion of\nAfrican-descended and Indigenous populations (Curiel 2007).\n\nThe reflections on race/ethnicity of Latin American feminist\nmethodology are diverse, demonstrating the racial heterogeneity\ngenerated by the colonial condition. Colonialism not only initiated\ncontemporary understandings of race/ethnicity but generated conditions\nof racial formation under systems of exploitation and subordination.\nSpecifically, the colonial history of Latin America entailed the\nsubordination of Indigenous and Afro-descended peoples (Schutte &\nFemen\u00edas 2010: 407). Economically, colonialism entailed the\nenslavement and exploitation of these populations. Culturally,\ncolonialism ensured the imposition of a socio-symbolic order that\nentrenched whiteness as a norm and cultural authority (Schutte &\nFemen\u00edas 2010: 407). Concurrently, norms of gender and class\nemerge through the production of race, whose economic impact is\nreflected through the link between whiteness and class ascension.\nSubsequently, nation-building projects in Latin America and the\nCaribbean were forged by political elites with patriarchal ideologies\nmired in racism and classism. The impact of these ideologies has\nentailed a racialized social stratification that reflects the\nprivilege of whiteness and leaves women disproportionally affected\n(Curiel 2007: 98).\n\nAgainst this backdrop, feminist reflections on race/ethnicity have\nsought to undermine the racism of national ideologies that have led to\ntheir subordination and marginalization. One such ideology is that of\nmestizaje which emerged as part of nation building projects\nthroughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Mestizaje favored\nthe formation of a racially-mixed people but came saturated with\nEurocentrism and privileged the whitening of the Americas.\nMestizaje ensured structural inequalities as it racialized\nclass differences while maintaining racism a myth. On the heels of\nthese conditions, notable contributions to the discussion on\nrace/ethnicity in Latin America and the Caribbean have come from\nAfro-descended and Indigenous women who have been systemically\nmarginalized in these social processes. They argue that\nmestizaje functions as a sequel to colonialism that continues\nto entail subordination and marginalization in social life (Curiel\n2007: 98).\n\nRacialized women in Latin America and the Caribbean have also pointed\nto the racism of dominant feminist methodology that took womanhood to\nbe a shared categorical status but dismissed the importance of the\nspecificities determined by race/ethnicity and class identity. In so\ndoing, the voices of racialized women have opened up new avenues for\ncontemporary critical feminist investigation. For instance,\nAfro-descended women have shown how the methodologies of studying\nwomen from colonial times detrimentally read the lives of enslaved\nwomen one-dimensionally as solely victims of slavery, overlooking the\nways in which many participated in acts of resistance. Acts like the\nwaste of household goods or self-induced abortions to avoid the\nenslavement of children are best understood as acts of domestic\nmarronage and need to be read as part of the history of Afro-descended\nwomen in the Americas (Albert 2003). In this context, the call for a\nmore multidimensional analysis of racialized women also entails\ndemonstrating that for racialized women, the public and the private\nspheres are not separate entities as hegemonic feminism purported\n(Curiel 2016: 49). Hence, a call for the blackening of feminism has\nemerged as a way of elucidating the relationship between racism and\nsexism in order to better understand the histories of women throughout\nthe Americas (Carneiro 2005).\n\nFurther, racialized women of Latin America and the Caribbean have\nprovided new constructive frameworks for conceptualizing racialized\nand ethnic identities. One such attempt can be found in the\ndevelopment of Amefricanidad, a term coined by Afro-Brazilian\nscholar L\u00e9ila Gonsalez, that resists the use of\nLatinidad because of its Eurocentric underpinnings, much like\nhow mestizaje downplays the Indigenous and African dimension\nof Latin America and the Caribbean (Curiel 2007: 99). Building on the\nuse of Amefricanidad or Amefricanicity, others have\nargued for the use of the term as a privileged epistemology that\nenhances the visibility of Afro-descended feminism in the region\n(Alvarez & Caldwell 2016: v). Amefricanidad tracks the\nimportance of African and Indigenous roots of identity, but also seeks\nto think from within those identities as it pursues an intersectional\napproach to racism, colonialism, and imperialism (Alvarez &\nCaldwell 2016: v). Amefricanidad tracks racialized identity,\nbut at the same time signals plurality in its capacity to capture the\nmultiple inheritances of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nBy keeping the impact of the colonial condition at the center of\ntheory, contemporary Latin American and Caribbean feminists have also\ncritically evaluated norms of sexuality, a topic which dominant\nliberal feminism long maintained at the margins. The lesbian movement\nof Latin America and the Caribbean stems from mixed-gender homosexual\norganizations that were in dialogue with the feminist movement of the\nlate 20th century (Bastian Duarte 2012: 165). However, for\nmuch of this time, discussions on sexual preference were set aside\nwithin the liberal feminist agenda. Lesbian feminism, much like the\nlarger panorama of Latin American feminism, is heterogeneous.\nNevertheless, there is one common theoretical denominator: the\nimperative to transform ideas and practices related to\nheteronormativity, lesbianism, and gender relations (Bastian Duarte\n2012: 169). At stake in the analysis of lesbian feminism is the way in\nwhich heteronormativity permeates all aspects of lived experience,\nincluding the intersections among sexuality, race/ethnicity, class,\nand gender. For instance, Afro-descended lesbian feminists have linked\nracism and sexism to heteronormativity by arguing that the obligatory\ndimensions of heterosexuality are intimately bound up with the\nreproduction of racist and sexist practices (Curiel 2016: 50). Others\nhave argued that there is an intimate relationship between lesbianism\nand feminism that hinges on the recognition that liberation for women\nis founded in decentering patriarchy, which often involves\nre-negotiating relationships with men and masculinity on all levels\n(Espinosa Mi\u00f1oso 2011: 404).\n\nImplicit in discussions of the complexity of identity is the\nrelationship between the individual and the collective. The\nrelationship between structural collective conditions and the\nformation of individual identity attends to the ways in which human\nbeings are not isolated meaning-makers. However, when the conditions\nof meaning-making reflect the heirlooms of colonialism, oppression,\npatriarchy, or obligatory heterosexuality, tense negotiations are\nrequired between the individual and the collective. Indigenous\nfeminists have negotiated the political and personal value of ethnic\nbelonging with individual feminist claims (Bastian Duarte 2012: 164).\nThe liberal neofeminist movement has long emphasized the importance of\nsexual and reproductive rights of women, but while these issues may\nrepresent core aspects of many women\u2019s lives, they do not\nrepresent core issues in Indigenous women\u2019s struggles.\n\nFor instance, the topic of violence is one at the center of feminist\nconcerns of many political persuasions. However, from the perspective\nof Indigenous feminism, violence is not just constructed in terms of\ngendered violence but is also generated by those who have seized and\ndestroyed Indigenous lands (Bastian Duarte 2012: 163). Hence, an\nunderstanding that projects violence solely centered on individuality\nwill not be sufficient to generate conditions of equality for\nIndigenous feminists whose collective identities serve as the primary\nmethod of preserving their cultural systems (Bastian Duarte 2012:\n164). The meaning of equality and justice for Indigenous feminists of\nLatin America and the Caribbean follows the specificity of their\npolitics, which takes the role of the community as central to identity\nand hence calls for new ways of thinking about the relationship\nbetween individual feminist demands and collective transformation\n(Bastian Duarte 2012: 165). Although not all Indigenous peoples of\nLatin America and the Caribbean reside in their own communities as\nmany have migrated to more urban areas, it is important to appreciate\nthe ways in which community in a multifaceted sense operates as an\nimportant feature of transformative projects.\n3. Latin American Feminist Philosophy\n\nLatin American feminist philosophy emerges at the nexus between theory\nand practice. The social activism of the 20th century\nfueled the production of theories that form the tradition of Latin\nAmerican feminist philosophy as well as its place in the academy.\nHowever, the study of Latin American feminist philosophy remains\nscarce and derelict (Gargallo 2015, Other Internet Resources). The\nsocial sciences have been the primary driver of institutional\nadvancement for feminist theory and to date philosophy trails in its\ntaking up of feminist issues as philosophical (Schutte 2003,\n208).  The existence of Latin American feminist philosophers\nhas been largely denied, and the specificities of their theoretical\ncontributions have been erased under the sexist, Eurocentric\norientation of philosophy. Recognition of their existence is a\npolitical act that contests the dominant architecture of the history\nof philosophy. Taking account of Latin American feminist philosophy\nrequires a historical and philosophical reconstruction that\nunderstands the fact that women from Latin America and the Caribbean\nhave long been thinkers. The philosophical work that remains to be\ndone requires engagement with their ideas.\n\nLatin American feminist philosophy is political (Gut\u00ederrez\nCasta\u00f1eda 1994: 186). The ideas that pushed social\ntransformation in the 20th century movements are grounded\nin politics that recognized the imperative for social change. The\npolitical dimension of Latin American feminist philosophy is reflected\nin the fact that many Latin American feminist philosophers were or are\nactivists, and the span of their thought often reflects their\nparticipation in resistance movements. Resistance can mean many types\nof political projects, and in the context of Latin American feminist\nphilosophy, the act of citing is understood as political because it\nworks toward building a philosophical canon that legitimizes the\nvoices of women long excluded from philosophical practice. In\nthis manner, feminism upholds a broad conception of politics that\ndisturbs the spaces in which it operates blurring the boundaries\nbetween the public and private (Gut\u00ederrez Casta\u00f1eda\n1994: 187)\n\nTracing a philosophical history of Latin American feminist thinkers is\na task that merits scholarly attention, and to date there is a lacuna\nof resources. One major obstacle is linguistic as a lot of textual\nsources have not been translated. Furthermore, the resources\nthemselves are not ample, although some notable publications have been\nmade. The Antolog\u00eda del pensamiento feminista\nnuestroamericano: tomo 1 del anhelo a la emancipaci\u00f3n\n(2010a) and Antolog\u00eda del pensamiento feminista\nnuestroamericano: tomo 2 movimiento de liberaci\u00f3n de las\nmujeres (2010b) coordinated by Francesca Gargallo are some of the\nfirst large-scale publications to anthologize Latin American and\nCarribean feminist philosophical writings. They are non-exhaustive\nresources that testify to the theoretical, argumentative, and\nmethodological contributions of Latin American and Caribbean feminist\nwriters spanning from the 15th to the 20th\ncentury. As the anthology rescues writers often lost to the pages of\nhistory, it also takes Latin America and the Caribbean, as\nnuestra or our America, as the point of theoretical\ndeparture. Thus, it enables a collective recognition of a history of\nfeminist thought that does not depend on North America or Europe for\nits identity. The anthology further demonstrates that Latin American\nfeminist philosophical thought is hardly new. It is grounded in a\nhistory of resistance to social and political conditions that impeded\nthe recognition of women as knowledge-producers (Gargallo 2009: 418).\nIt has been argued that early feminist philosophies are some of the\nfirst systems of thought to account for the politics of legitimacy\nwhereby social conditions grant privilege to the epistemic productions\nof one group in order to exclude and delegitimize the voices of others\n(Gargallo 2009: 420). The critique of legitimacy is one that follows\nLatin American feminist philosophy well into the 20th and\n21st centuries.\n\nFor instance, Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1651\u20131695), one of\nthe most cited writers of this tradition, advocated for the\nintellectual life of women, which entailed denouncing norms of\nhegemonic masculinity. Her image as a protofeminist writer has been\nassociated with lesbianism, as she led a monastic life and in so\ndoing, resisted the dominance of masculinity (Gargallo 2009: 419). Her\nexistence as an intellectual defied the authority of her times and her\nresistance is reflected in her writing.\n\nA further example can be found in the thought of Luisa Capetillo\n(1879\u20131922), which is rooted in her participation in labor\nmovements in Puerto Rico and the United States during her lifetime. As\na cigar factory reader, she was employed by the workers and functioned\nas an intellectual and cultural intermediary by reading workers\neverything from news to political theory. Capetillo became a reader at\na time when forty percent of the tobacco workers and eighty-seven\npercent of the agricultural work force of Puerto Rico were illiterate\n(Ramos 1992: 14). However, the presence of readers, like Capetillo,\nmade the tobacco labor force one of the most socially conscious (Ramos\n1992: 21). Her activism drew intellectual support from European\nanarchist philosophy that traveled to Puerto Rico through translations\nof authors like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Diderot, Bakunin, Kropotkin,\nMarx, and Nietzsche (Ramos 1992: 27). Capetillo made a mark on the\nPuerto Rican labor movement, but she became a transnational migrant as\nshe was driven out of Puerto Rico by a government crackdown on\nanarchists (Ruiz 2016: 3). In her short life of forty-two years she\nwould come to reside in New York City, Ybor City, and La Habana as she\ncontinued her activism by organizing labor strikes, arguing against\nthe institution of marriage, engaging in stylized resistance by\nwearing men\u2019s clothing, and publishing four books (Ramos 1992:\n66). Capetillo\u2019s most important contribution was producing ideas\nrooted in a workers\u2019 rights movement that moved across nations\nand was itself inspired by the travel of ideas.\n\nPhilosophy as a field of study in Latin America and the Caribbean was\ninstitutionalized and professionalized in the years spanning\n1940\u20131960. Hence, it is no surprise that subsequently women\ngained formal university education in philosophy. Matilde Carranza\n(1892\u20131981), born in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica, was Costa\nRica\u2019s first woman to receive a Ph.D. in philosophy. She\nattended the University of Wisconsin and is also noted as one of the\nfirst women to receive a doctoral degree from the university. Her\nphilosophical thought centered on the importance of education for\nsocial transformation, which aligned with her anti-despotic and\negalitarian politics. However, her most notable impact was shattering\nthe myth that women were not apt for philosophy, thus paving the way\nfor women of other generations (Prada Ortiz 2013: 32\u201333). Ana\nIsabel Alfaro (1944\u20131990), born in Alajuela, Costa Rica, studied\nphilosophy at the University of Costa Rica. Her philosophical\ncommitments centered on the role of education in national development,\nas she took education to be socially transformative. As a result,\nAlfaro saw the role of the university as an integral part of social\nchange. Her commitments to the transformative powers of education were\nmethodologically rooted in interdisciplinarity and cultural diversity.\nNotably, Alfaro placed importance on the creative power of women\nwithin her philosophy of education, arguing for their creative\npotential and reflecting this commitment in her political alliances\nwith poor women (Prada Ortiz 2013: 55).\n\nFollowing suit, Monelisa Lina P\u00e9rez Marchand, Victoria Junco\nPosadas, Olga Victoria Quiroz Mart\u00ednez, Rosa Krauze, Elsa\nCecilia Frost, Vera Yamuni, and Mar\u00eda del Carmen Rovira Gaspar\nentered academic philosophy in Mexico in the middle of the\n20th century through the seminars of Jos\u00e9 Gaos\n(Gargallo 2015, Other Internet Resources). Notable among these is Vera\nYamuni (1917\u20132003) and Mar\u00eda del Carmen Rovira, who\nrecognized the importance of doing philosophy from a Latin American\nperspective with a keen eye toward the specificities of women. Rovira\nwould apply this methodology to historicism and Yamuni to humanism\n(Gargallo 2009: 423). Yamuni is particularly important as her work and\nplace in the academy influenced many generations of feminist\nphilosophers. She was a transnational thinker born of Lebanese parents\nin Costa Rica, although she did most of her studying, teaching, and\nwriting in Mexico. Yamuni studied under Gaos and would dedicate a part\nof her intellectual career to engaging with the work of Gaos, notably\ncritiquing his misogyny. She further dedicated time to translate texts\nfrom English and Arabic to Spanish, reflecting her commitment to\ncreating conditions of philosophical access (Prada Ortiz 2013: 71).\nHowever, she is notably remembered as a feminist thinker through her\nwork on Sappho, Virginia Woolf, and Simone de Beauvoir, as well as her\nfeminist analysis of the role of women in the history of philosophy.\nHer writing conceptually explored sameness and difference long before\nit became a hotbed of feminist philosophical analysis in the 1990s\n(Prada Ortiz 2013: 87). Her influence as a feminist philosopher is\nprofound as she has been cited as the first to introduce feminist\nphilosophy into Mexico by her student Graciela Hierro, who became an\niconic figure of Latin American feminist philosophy in the 1980s and\n1990s (Prada Ortiz 2013: 83).\n\nThe social transformation of the 1970s and 1980s reverberated into the\nfield of philosophy. As women increasingly began to establish\nthemselves in the academy, their ideas developed. On the shoulders of\nsymbolic mothers and the politics of the times, Latin American\nfeminist philosophy began to proliferate as a diverse system of\nthought that took feminist theorizing to be a form of politics.\nHowever, the points of departure for analysis varied. Graciela Hierro,\nstudent of Yamuni, developed a feminist ethics informed by\nutilitarianism that explored the intimate relationship between ethics\nand politics focused on liberation and pleasure. For Hierro,\nwomen\u2019s politics is one centered on making claims about the role\nof women in a society where the condition of womanhood is understood\nas a variant characteristic of human life (Hierro 1990). Hierro, much\nlike Yamuni and the women that came before her, functioned as a\nsymbolic philosophical mother to many as she heavily influenced a\ngeneration of feminist scholars. Eli Bartra, a student of\nHierro\u2019s, maintained that feminism is a theoretical current\ndedicated to uncovering what it means to be a woman. For her, the\nfeminist project is political because feminism is a political\nphilosophy (Bartra 2001: 12). Diana Helena Maff\u00eda of Argentina,\ninfluenced by Bartra, further maintains that feminism is both a\npolitical position and a critical theory that lends itself toward the\nrevision of political ideals (Rietti & Maff\u00eda 2005).\nMar\u00eda Luisa Femen\u00edas, also writing from Argentina,\nmaintains a link between feminism and politics but takes Latin\nAmerican feminism to be characterized by its unique appreciation of\nthe intersections among gender, class, race/ethnicity, and religion as\nthey collectively forged conditions of existence (Femen\u00edas\n2007). Urania Ungo Montenegro of Panam\u00e1 defines feminism as a\npolitical theory of women that reflects the relationship between women\nand politics (Ungo Montenegro 2000).\n\nAlthough they diverge in their characterizations of the relationship\nbetween feminism and politics, all of these positions share a general\nunderstanding that to philosophically discuss Latin American feminism\nis to engage in political theory in a way that elucidates the diverse\nand complex relationships among women, gender, and politics. This list\nis by no means exhaustive, and further figures like Rosario\nCastellanos of Mexico and Celia Amor\u00f3s of Spain should not be\nforgotten as they influenced the positions developed by these\nthinkers. Furthermore, philosophers like Ofelia Schutte, Cuban-born\nand writing in the United States, have made notable contributions to\nthe landscape of Latin American feminist philosophy, reminding readers\nthat the feminist tradition occupies a part of a wider tradition of\npolitical liberation and theory of Latin America. All of these women\ndared to be thinkers at times when being a Latin American woman in\nphilosophy was unheard of, and they have come to form the foundation\nof a canon of thinkers that paved the way for new and emerging\nvoices.\n\nThe work of Ofelia Schutte in the United States remains one of the\nmost important contributions to Latin American Feminist Philosophy as\nshe is responsible for creating academic spaces that bridged ideas\nacross the hemisphere for English speaking audiences. In 1988 she\npublished \u201cPhilosophy and Feminism in Latin America:\nPerspectives on Gender and Culture\u201d (Schutte 1988), which\nprovides a framework for understanding the sociocultural specificity\nof women\u2019s conditions in Latin America (Schutte 1988: 63).\nIn 1994 she guest edited a special issue in Hypatia on\nSpanish and Latin American Feminist Philosophy featuring essays by\nCelia Amor\u00f3s, Mar\u00eda Luisa Femen\u00edas, Graciela\nHierro, and Griselda Gut\u00ederrez Casta\u00f1eda. The special\nissue closes with a list of Women\u2019s Studies Centers and\nPrograms in Latin America and Spain by country featuring Argentina,\nCuba, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Spain (Schutte 1994: 194). In\nbringing these voices together, Schutte bookmarks the birth of\nphilosophical feminisms of Latin America by flagging new\ninterpretations of philosophy that question the links between\nknowledge, gender, and power (Schutte 1994: 143). The special\nissue mirrors the framing of Feminist Philosophy in Latin\nAmerica and Spain (2007) edited by Amy Oliver and Mar\u00eda\nLuisa Femen\u00edas. Feminist Philosophy in Latin America and\nSpain continues to be one of the most important compilations of\nLatin American feminist philosophy in English featuring a range of\ntopics including ethics, gender, history, patriarchy,\ntranslation, and sexuality. \n\nArgumentatively, Schutte lays the philosophical groundwork for a\nrobust Latin American feminist philosophical methodology over the\ncourse of her career. In \u201cPhilosophy and Feminism in Latin\nAmerica: Perspectives on Gender and Culture\u201d (1988) she begins\nto frame Latin American feminist philosophy as a field that unfolds\nfrom gender consciousness in the context of discrimination and\noppression with specific research strategies that can appropriately\nattend to the situation of Latin American women and girls (Schutte\n1988: 65). Building on these insights, the last chapter of her\nbook Cultural Identity and Social Liberation in Latin American\nThought  (1993) takes up an analysis of the relationship\nbetween cultural identity, feminist theory, and liberation by\nexploring the historical precedents of Latin American feminist theory,\nplural feminist research strategies, the specificity of Latin America\nin relationship to gender issues as well as the evaluative and\nparticipatory models that structure feminist politics of the region\n(Schutte 1993). Her insights with respect to the specificity of the\nLatin American condition and gender elucidate the complexities of\ncontext that generate the conditions of the possibilities of Latin\nAmerican feminist thought requires centering the topics of\nviolence against women, women and development, and women and domestic\nwork that point toward the patriarchal appropriation of women\u2019s\nbodies and labor for social reproduction (Schutte 1993: 215).\nUltimately, the specificity of the Latin American gender context\nproduces the orienting markers of a Latin American feminist\ntheoretical method: a critical conception of knowledge, a connection\nbetween theory and practice, progressive projects and concepts of\nfreedom and liberation, and transformative politics of culture\n(Schutte 2011). Here transformation needs to be decolonizing in\nthat it needs to overcome the privileges of Eurocentric coloniality\nand Ango-Eurocentric modernity. Transformation is a constant challenge\nthat unleashes the perspectives of women of color, LGBTIQQ subjects,\necological feminisms and perspectives suppressed by male dominant\nconsortiums of power (Schutte 2011: 800). \n\nIn this vein, dissident voices of the early 2000s waged a decolonial\ncritique that came to characterize contemporary Latin American\nfeminist philosophical scholarship. Influenced by the pivotal\ncontributions of Mar\u00eda Lugones (2007, 2008), contemporary\ndecolonial Latin American feminist scholarship has tackled\nEurocentrism, colonial underpinnings, and omissions of identity in\nfeminist philosophy. Lugones was an integral voice in the formation of\na decolonial feminist tradition as she was the first scholar to\narticulate the concept of the coloniality of gender. In conversation\nwith the scholarship of Peruvian An\u00edbal Quijano (2000), she\nmaintained that the modern sex/gender system is rooted in the colonial\nproject that imposes a dimorphic sex/gender system framed through\nheteronormativity. Complementing Quijano, she maintains that the\ncolonial/modern gender system required the categorization of human and\nnon-human and the invention of racial divisions of the human. However,\nshe critically adds that gender played an important role in these\nrelationships, a point Quijano overlooks. As a result, the status of\nwhite women, existing alongside colonizing white men, operated on a\ndifferent nexus committed to the reproduction of racialized humanity.\nThe peoples of the colonized world did not participate in the modern\ngender system prior to its imposition. The import of this argument is\nthat gender and sexuality are co-constitutive of race and are formed\nin and through the colonial project that sought to subordinate\ncolonized peoples. Hence, to theorize about gender entails a look at\nthe heirlooms of colonialism that built the possibilities of the\nmodern world through the categorization of people into racialized,\ngendered humanity. This critique problematizes any idea of shared\ngender in womanhood because it fails to account for the racial and\nclass differences that cut across the formations of identities in the\nAmericas.\n\nOne of the most notable and comprehensive texts that brings Latin\nAmerican decolonial voices together is Tejiendo de otro modo:\nfeminism, espistemolog\u00eda y apuestas descoloniales en Abya\nYala (2014b), edited by Yuderkys Espinosa Mi\u00f1oso, Diana\nG\u00f3mez Correal, and Karina Ochoa Mu\u00f1oz. The book provides\na critical intervention in contemporary Latin American feminisms from\nthe diverse positions and experiences of women (Escobar 2014: 11).\nRooted in decolonial epistemic practices, the book reconceives Latin\nAmerica as Abya Yala, the Kuna (Indigenous people of\nPanam\u00e1 and Colombia) term for what colonizers termed\n\u201cAmerica\u201d. Abya Yala translates as \u201cland of\nfull maturity\u201d or \u201cland of vital blood\u201d and is taken\nas a methodological starting point for theorizing ways of knowing\nthrough a decolonial lens. The contributors adhere to the claim that\ndecolonization cannot occur without de-patriarchialization. In other\nwords, resistance to capitalism, racism, homophobia, and all forms of\ndomination related to our modern social order has to incorporate\nstrategies of de-patriarchialization (Escobar 2014: 11). As such, the\ntext brings to the fore the importance of intersecting Latin American\nfeminisms with decolonial thought and exemplifies new emerging\ncritical voices that contribute to growth and proliferation.\n\nThe scholarship notably produces a Latin American feminist genealogy\ncommitted to prioritizing the voices of those systematically\nmarginalized or ignored and decenters dominant white,\nupper/middle-class feminisms that have failed to account for\ndifference (Espinosa Mi\u00f1oso et al. 2014a: 14). The scholarship\nis a further testament to the fact that no one dominant category will\nsolve the problem of unification (Espinosa Mi\u00f1oso et al. 2014a:\n20). The project of decolonial feminisms is not framed by privileging\none category of analysis over another (e.g., race over gender);\nrather, it proposes a systemic critique focused on the conceptual\nframework of dominant Latin American feminisms, calling attention to\nthe ways it has reified classism, sexism, racism, and\nheteronormativity. The project of decolonial feminisms is a movement\nin process, but its core seeks to bring together the productions of\nthinkers, intellectuals, feminist activists, lesbian feminists,\nAfro-descended women, Indigenous peoples, poor mestizas, and\nallies committed to the historical recuperation of anti-racist theory\nand practice from the epistemic position of Abya Yala\n(Espinosa Mi\u00f1oso et al. 2014a: 32).\n\nTwo notable examples of decolonial feminist theory can be found in the\nwork of Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui and Rita Segato. Silvia Rivera\nCusicanqui is a Bolivian feminist sociologist and historian. She is\nknown for her critical historical analysis of the sociology of the\nimage, which holds that images have the power to construct critical\nnarratives that can un-frame different forms of contemporary\ncolonialism (Rivera Cusicanqui 2010). Images, more than words than\nthemselves, engender the hierarchy of the textual over the visual that\ncome to give identity markers meaning. However, words hide meaning and\nimages can reveal buried layers of meaning that may not be spoken.\nAlongside the preponderance of text and the presupposed colonial\nuniversality it carries exist other worlds of meaning marked by\nthe term ch\u2019ixi, which Rivera Cusicanqui describes as\nthat which is mottled in that it obeys the Aymara idea that things can\nbe and not be at the same time. The power of the undifferentiated is\nthat it is conjugated in opposites (Rivera Cusicanqui 2010: 70).\nIn a similar transformative critical move, Argentinian-Brazilian\nanthropologist Rita Segato, develops her lines of research at the\ncross-roads between a critique of coloniality and a responsive\nanthropology (Segato 2022: 1). The anthropological project, she\nargues, needs to be open to being interpellated through difference\nwithin the \u201cwe\u201d of the moral community that allows the\nother to judge us and tell us who we are and what is expected of us\n(Segato 2022: 3). The decolonial responsive anthropology she\ndevelops opens the door for questions on the nature of patriarchy, the\nrole of the state, and the intimate yet unspoken ways in which race\nand class are co-constituted, which are all explored in La\ncr\u00edtica de la colonialidad en ocho ensayos (2013) recently\ntranslated to English in 2022. \n\nThe Latin American decolonial feminist tradition has found influential\nallies in the Latina/x feminist tradition of the United States.\nLatina/x feminisms took shape during the 1960s and 1970s as part of a\nwide range of political struggles seeking gender and social justice\nthat comes to form a wide landscape of theories. The term\n\u201cLatina/x\u201d is broad, but far from monolithic as it can\ncapture a range of identities (e.g., Afro-Latina, Afro-Caribbean,\nNuyorican, Xicana). It symbolically encapsulates identity conditions\nof migration, immigration, and diaspora to the United States from\ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Although Latina/x\nfeminisms are a wide-ranging field, they generally adhere to a system\nof thought that attempts to unravel interlocking systems of\noppression, reflecting on the conditions of borderlands,\nrace/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, immigration, and religion in unique\nways. Most importantly, Latina/x feminist theory pays close attention\nto lived experience and made notable contributions to theories of\nidentity that extend beyond the borders of the United States. Here,\nfigures like Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Cherr\u00ede Moraga, Emma\nP\u00e9rez, Juanita Ramos, Norma Alarc\u00f3n, Chela Sandoval,\nMariana Ortega, Ofelia Schutte, and Mar\u00eda Lugones have been of\nsignificance. Notably, the work of Anzald\u00faa influenced\nLugones\u2019 conceptualization of the coloniality of gender, which\nis at the centerfold of decolonial feminist theory in both Latin\nAmerica and the United States. Although theories are always tied to\ntheir locations, they also travel in ways that require attending to\nthe processes of re-signification undergone through their traffic. It\nis for this reason that some decolonial feminist thinkers have called\nfor closer attention to the specificities of alterity that might set\nlimits on the theoretical application of ideas (Mendoza 2014: 101).\nMost recently, the collection of essays Theories of the\nFlesh (2020) explores the specificities of living alterity\nin the flesh in ways that bridge Latinx and Latin American feminist\norientations around decolonial critique, epistemologies of resistance,\nand coalitional politics. Hence, the Latina/x feminist\ntradition has been influential on its own merits and continues to pave\ncoalitional roads with Latin American and Caribbean thinkers both\nwithin and outside the United States.\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe history of Latin American and Caribbean feminist ideas is\nextensive. However, it is one that remains underappreciated in North\nAmerican and European academic spaces. The omission of Latin American\nfeminisms is further compounded by the fact that most of its primary\nresources remain untranslated from Spanish, making the travel of ideas\ndifficult. For some, the linguistic inaccessibility might not be\nproblematic as it signals the need for epistemic centers to\naccommodate across difference, and for others, it merely highlights\nthe ample amount of work that remains to be done. Either way, the\nLatin American feminist tradition is one that methodologically reminds\nits readers that theory is always grounded in practice. Thus, placing\nthe ideas of women and their push for social transformation at the\ncenterfold of philosophical and theoretical activity demands\ncontextualization. For philosophical practices more specifically,\nLatin American feminisms remind us that women have been thinking much\nlonger than they have been credited for and philosophers need to\nmerely start asking: What were they thinking about?\n",
