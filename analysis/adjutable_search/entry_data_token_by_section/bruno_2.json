Cosmology: The Universe and the Atom\n\nHow and when Bruno began to develop what he called his \u201cnew\nphilosophy\u201d is uncertain (Granada 1990). His earliest surviving philosophical\nwork, On the Shadows of the Ideas, dated 1582, hints at a few\nof its propositions, including heliocentricism (BOL II.1, 7\u20138). The first detailed\nstatement, however, came in The Ash Wednesday Supper,\npublished at London in 1584, in which he set out his interpretation of\nCopernicus\u2019s heliocentric hypothesis, as explained in On the\nRevolutions (1543). Dismissing contemporary claims that\nCopernicus\u2019s hypothesis was merely a convenient computational\ndevice, Bruno announced that it disproved the traditional\nAristotelian-Ptolemaic picture of the cosmos. In the first place, it\ndisproved Aristotle\u2019s doctrine that each sublunary element had a\nfixed \u201cnatural place\u201d at the centre of the\ncosmos\u2014the earth\u2019s globe at the very centre, water in the\nsphere immediately surrounding it, followed by the air and fire\nspheres\u2014and that particles of the elements, if displaced from\nthese natural spheres, had an intrinsic impulse to regain them. On the\ncontrary, since the earth, Bruno explained, was a planet circling the\nsun, the elemental spheres of which it was constituted were\ncontinuously in motion. The elements did not have absolute\n\u201cnatural places\u201d; and an elemental part, whether displaced\nfrom a whole or chancing to be near a whole, sought to attach itself\nto it because a whole was the place where it would be best preserved.\nOnce united with a whole, elemental parts were no longer heavy or\nlight and revolved with it naturally, that is, without resistance.\nThis doctrine of gravity drew on Ficino\u2019s Neoplatonic ideas of\nelemental motion, Copernicus\u2019s doctrine of gravity,\nLucretius\u2019s comments on the weightlessness of parts in their\nwholes and scholastic notions of self-conservation (Knox 2002).\n\n\n\nPeter Apian, Cosmographicus liber (1524, p. 6). The woodcut\ntypifies the medieval and Renaissance picture of the cosmos that Bruno\nsought to discredit. At the centre lies the terraqueous globe,\nunderstood as a combination of the earth and water\nspheres. Surrounding them are the concentric spheres of the other two\nsublunary elements, air and fire. Beyond the fire sphere is the\nsuperlunary region, which comprises: a) seven spheres, each of which\ncarries a planet\u2014the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars,\nJupiter and Saturn\u2014around the centre of the cosmos; and b) four\nouter spheres, namely, the firmament (i.e.  the sphere of fixed\nstars), the crystalline sphere, the primum mobile and the\nempyrean.

It\nwas left to Bruno, the philosopher, to accomplish the full revolution\nof thought, pass beyond the quantitative sensible realm that,\nimportant stepping stone though it was, had unduly preoccupied\nmathematicians like Copernicus and proceed to knowledge of what could\nbe discerned by reason alone (BOI I, 448\u2013454). Copernicus\u2019s most egregious\nshortcoming in this respect was his failure to recognize that his\nheliocentric hypothesis disproved Aristotelian and scholastic\narguments that the cosmos, or rather universe, was finite and\nunique. If the heavens were infinite, these arguments ran, then their\noutermost regions would \u2014impossibly\u2014 revolve infinitely\nfast around the earth at centre of the cosmos. Nor could there be more\nthan one cosmos, because, if there were, then a displaced particle of\nan element would \u2014no less impossibly\u2014have two or more\nnatural places to which it should return. These objections carried no\nweight in a heliocentric world. The apparent daily rotation of a\nfirmament or \u201csphere of fixed stars\u201d around the earth was\nan illusion created by the earth\u2019s rotation around its axis as\nit circled the sun. The universe was not, Bruno insisted, a finite\nglobe composed of concentric spheres, \u201clike an onion\u201d (BOL\nI.2, 261), to use a common simile. Instead it was an infinite,\nhomogeneous expanse populated by an infinite number of solar systems\nlike our own. How far his achievement surpassed that of Columbus, who\nhad discovered just one continent on one earth (BOI I, 451\u2013452)!\nLucretius, Nicholas of Cusa (1401\u201364) and counterfactual\nscholastic discussions concerning the plurality of worlds are evident\ninfluences. The authority that Bruno particularly liked to invoke,\nhowever, was Scripture. The infinite number of celestial bodies\ncorresponded to \u201cthose so many hundreds of thousands [of\nangels]\u201d\u2014an allusion to Daniel 7:10\u2014\u201cthat\nassist in the ministry and contemplation of the first, universal,\ninfinite and eternal efficient cause\u201d (BOI I, 455).\n\n\nThe celestial or, as Bruno called them, \u201cprincipal\u201d bodies\nglided weightlessly within an infinite \u201creceptacle\u201d or\n\u201cexpanse\u201d of aether (BOI II, 110) like specks of dust in\nthe sunlit air (BOL I.1, 262; I.2, 91). What made them move? Their\nsouls. They were animate and, as their orderly patterns of motion\nattested, intelligent too. Aristotle had suggested this among other\npossible explanations for celestial motion. Most patristic and\nscholastic authors, anxious to discourage polytheism, had rejected the\nidea. Ficino\u2019s revival of Platonism, however, had given a new\nlease of life to the idea that the celestial bodies were animate.\nTrue to form, Bruno, though indebted to Ficino on this as on many\nother scores, quoted the Book of Job (28:20\u201321) as his\nauthority. In each solar system or, in Bruno\u2019s terminology,\n\u201csynod\u201d the suns and earth regulated their motions\nautonomously to their mutual advantage. From the earths, the suns\nabsorbed vaporous exhalations. In exchange the sun produced the light\nand heat that the earths, as \u201canimals\u201d, needed in order to\nhost living things. No part of them remained forever barren thanks to\nthe several approximately circular revolutions that they performed.\nNature, for Bruno no less than for Aristotle, did nothing in vain (BOL\nIII, 108).\n\nIn keeping with these ideas, Bruno populated the principal bodies with\nlife-forms of every kind. Each region of each principal body comprised\nmatter which, circumstances permitting, became a plant or animal, even\na rational animal. This last category included human beings and also\ndemons, in other words, rational beings with rarefied bodies made of\npure aether or combinations of aether with air, water or earth. The\nlatter, to judge by the demons frequenting the elemental regions of\nour globe, were generally, but by no means invariably, more\nintelligent than human beings. Within the mountains were dim-witted\ntroglodytes jealously guarding the earth\u2019s mineral veins (BOL I.2, 61, 282; III, 431).\nLong-living but of feeble intelligence, they had little commerce with\nhuman beings. Stone-throwing demons, another species of earthy demon,\nof the kind described by the Byzantine author Michael Psellos, had\nlairs in the vicinity of Nola and habitually pelted those who passed\nnearby at night, as Bruno knew from personal experience (BOL III, 431). Nymphs with\npredominantly aqueous bodies lived secluded in grottos (BOL I.2, 282; III, 181). The variety of\ndemonic life was such that it \u201cfar surpassed that of sensible\nthings\u201d (BOL III, 427, 429). A comparable diversity was evident\namong human beings, who differed in skin colour and stature from region\nto region (BOL I.2, 282, 284). The variations reflected their diverse habitats. When\nextinguished by a cataclysm of some kind, they regenerated\nspontaneously (BOL I.2, 282), in the manner that Avicenna and, if only as a\nphilosophical possibility, some Christian authors had described. The\nnovelty in Bruno\u2019s interpretation was the idea that spontaneous\ngeneration explained the variety of life in an infinite and infinitely\nvaried universe rather than the survival of a privileged species on\nthis earth.\n\nThe principal bodies, human beings and demons were the three genera of\nrational animal inhabiting the universe. In one important respect,\nhowever, principal bodies were unique. Like accomplished\nmusicians\u2014here Bruno adapted an analogy used by Plotinus and\nmany others to illustrate how nature operated non-discursively\naccording to a final cause\u2014they did not think rationally,\nproceeding from one thought to the next as they executed their roles.\nTheir intellects dominated their animal bodies, enabling them to move\nintuitively in accordance with the ends proper to them. Unlike human\nbeings, too, the celestial \u201canimals\u201d were eternal and\nhence did not reproduce, grow or decay. Though corruptible\nintrinsically, they were, as the Chaldeans and Plato had taught,\nsustained by divine providence (for providence, see \n Section 5). \nThis is, at least, what Bruno tended to think even if\nhe conceded, uncharacteristically, that he was uncertain on this point\n(Granada, 2000). In all other respects, the principal bodies were\nanimals like any other. Stones and other parts of our earth, for\nexample, might seem inanimate but, as parts of a principle body, they were, like the bones, nails and hair of an\nanimal, alive, if only vestigially. Like animals, too, the principal\nbodies fed and excreted. They expelled stray particles from the\nsurrounding aether and in compensation emitted others, an idea\ninspired by Lucretius\u2019s concept of simulacra (On\nthe Nature of Things, IV.54\u2013268).\n\nThis picture was incompatible with traditional doctrines of the\nelements. Aristotelian, Neoplatonic and scholastic cosmology distinguished neatly\nbetween the super- and sublunary regions. The superlunary region and\nthe celestial bodies within it were composed entirely of aether. This\n\u201cfifth element\u201d or quintessence was devoid of all change\nother than that of perfect, unending, circular motion. The sublunary\nregion comprised the remaining four elements, fire, air, water and\nearth, which by nature observed finite linear motion upwards or\ndownwards. In addition to finite local motion, bodies composed of the\nsublunary elements continuously underwent generation and\ncorruption. In these respects the superlunary region was superior to\nthe sublunary one. Indeed, even within the sublunary region, according\nto many authors, the four elements were organized hierarchically, with\nearth as the dullest and grossest element at the centre of the cosmos\nand fire as the nimblest and subtlest sublunary element, akin to the\nneighbouring celestial region.\n\nNo such hierarchy could obtain in a homogeneous universe populated by\nanimate suns and earths of the kind that Bruno imagined. Fire, air,\nwater and earth, as they were commonly conceived, were present in each\nand every celestial body, indeed all four were present in each part of\nevery celestial body. Just as in a syllable, each letter was equally\nimportant\u2014an Aristotelian analogy that Bruno turned to his own\npurposes (BOL I.2, 118; Aristotle Metaphysics, VII.17,\n1041b11\u201333)\u2014so too were the elements in the composition of\na body. Timely support came from contemporary accounts of the 1572\nsupernova and theories about comets proposed by Tycho Brahe and others\n(Tessicini 2007, 112\u2013150). The birth of a new star proved that\ngeneration did, after all, occur in the superlunary region. As for\ncomets, they were indeed, as Aristotle and others held, composed of\nthe same elements as other sublunary things but they were not, as they\nhad concluded, sublunary phenomena peculiar to the air and fire\nspheres. Their trajectories proved that were superlunary objects or,\nmore exactly, planets which, owing to the incline at which they\nrevolved around the sun, only intermittently reflected the sun\u2019s\nlight towards the earth. The supposedly sublunary elements occurred in\nthe superlunary region! In short, not only reason but also observation\ndisproved the notion of a cosmos divided into two finite regions of\ncontrasting properties (BOL I.1, 219\u2013221). This was a vivid\nexample of Bruno\u2019s constant refrain that the senses, regulated\nby reason, could be used to advantage (BOI II, 10, 136\u2013137;\nBOL I.2, 196, 218; II.2, 78; Firpo 2000, 57, doc. 11).\n Bruno\u2019s alternative theory of the elements drew on Pythagoreanism,\nancient atomism, medieval discussions, pro and contra, of indivisible\nminims and Nicholas of Cusa\u2019s elemental doctrines (BOL III,\n510\u2013536). Corporeal things comprised two material principles,\nearth and water, and two immaterial ones, spirit and soul. By\n\u201cearth\u201d Bruno meant the discrete, identical, irreducible\nspheres of which physical things were made. He often called them\n\u201catoms\u201d to emphasize their indivisibility. The\ncircumferences and centres of these spherical atoms coincided. Hence,\nas some medieval authors had proposed, atoms were dimensionless\nbodies, unlike the atoms imagined by Democritus and other ancient\natomists. They were, as Bruno said, the principles of spatial\ncontraction, of solidity. Water, by contrast, was a continuum and the\nprinciple of corporeal extension. Two or more atoms, though\ndimensionless, bonded by water constituted a determinate body in\nspace, just as two or more dimensionless points, in Bruno\u2019s\nPythagorean geometry, constituted a line. \u201cThe minimal body or\natom was the substance of all things\u201d (BOL I.3,\n140). Observation confirmed this theory: dry, dusty, earth congealed\nwith the addition of water.\n\nThe two non-material principles, spirit and soul, related to each\nother analogously. Soul, the principle of motion, aggregated atoms and\nthereby determined the identity of a body. Spirit\u2014the\nspiritus popularized by Ficino\u2014was the incorporeal\nmedium through which soul connected with body. Soul accounted for the\nexistence of fire. In its purest form, fire was the combination of\nwater and light, which, as others, including Ficino, had explained,\nwas the physical analogue of the intellectual soul governing all\nthings (for soul and light, see further\n Section 4).\nThis explained why flame resembled water flashing in sunlight: in the\nformer, soul predominated, in the latter, water. The Egyptians Hermes\nTrismegistus and Moses corroborated this idea. Both had understood\nfire to be essentially water (BOL I.1, 376; Genesis 1:6\u20137;\nHermes Trismegistus, Pimander, I.5). Again, in Genesis\n1:1\u20133 Moses had spoken of earth, the water (the\n\u201cabyss\u201d), spirit and light but ignored fire and air,\nprecisely because they were not true elements. Similarly air was a\nderivative rather than, as conventionally believed, an element in its\nown right. Heat generated by fire vaporized water to produce the air\nof the kind that we breath, and this vaporous air merged seamlessly\ninto the empty, dimensionless, space beyond the atmosphere surrounding\na celestial body. This space was the aether, though not the aether of\nconventional cosmology. It was the continuum spread throughout the\nuniverse and through the corporeal things contained in it, binding\nthem together\u2014not unlike the Stoic pneuma interpreted as\nhexis\u2014without, however, moving them. It was, in other\nwords, spiritus, the motionless immaterial medium through\nwhich soul, the principle of motion, operated. As such,\nspiritus or aether was the container\u2014non-terminated\nspace\u2014in which all things were located.\n\nBruno\u2019s elemental theory disproved outright the dominant\nAristotelian view that the universe was finite but infinitely\ndivisible. It also disproved ancient atomism. Democritus, Epicurus,\nLucretius and others had, it is true, correctly surmised that the\nuniverse was infinite and comprised an infinite number of finite,\nindivisible, atoms. But their atoms were solids, although\nimperceptible ones, of various shapes, weights and sizes floating in a\nvacuum, a conclusion that led to a mechanistic view of the universe,\nwhich Bruno did not countenance. Correctly understood, atoms were\nincorporeal spheres with spatial locations. Soul, working through the\nintermediary of aether or spirit, joined these incorporeal, identical,\nspheres to make a body. Indeed, they were not so much components as\ninstances of the universe. Intrinsically dimensionless, their centres\ncoincided with their circumferences. Conversely, since the universe\nwas an infinite, indivisible (atomus) sphere, its centre was\nomnipresent. Both were absolute physical monads, indivisible unities,\nthe centres and circumferences of which coincided. They differed\ninasmuch as the maximum was the \u201cunfolding\u201d of\nthe minimum and a minimum was the\n\u201cenfolding\u201d of the maximum.\n",
