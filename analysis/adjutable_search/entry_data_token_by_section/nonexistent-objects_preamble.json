    "main_text": "\n\nAre there nonexistent objects, i.e., objects that do not exist? Some\nexamples often cited are: Zeus, Pegasus, Sherlock Holmes, Vulcan (the\nhypothetical planet postulated by the 19th century astronomer Le\nVerrier), the perpetual motion machine, the golden mountain, the\nfountain of youth, the round square, etc. Some important philosophers\nhave thought that the very concept of a nonexistent object is\ncontradictory (Hume) or logically ill-formed (Kant, Frege), while\nothers (Leibniz, Meinong, the Russell of Principles of\nMathematics) have embraced it wholeheartedly.\n\nOne of the reasons why there are doubts about the concept of a\nnonexistent object is this: to be able to say truly of an object that\nit doesn\u2019t exist, it seems that one has to presuppose that it\nexists, for doesn\u2019t a thing have to exist if we are to make a\ntrue claim about it? In the face of this puzzling situation, one has\nto be very careful when accepting or formulating the idea that there\nare nonexistent objects. It turns out that Kant\u2019s view that\n\u201cexists\u201d is not a \u201creal\u201d predicate and\nFrege\u2019s view, that \u201cexists\u201d is not a predicate of\nindividuals (i.e., a predicate that yields a well-formed sentence if\none puts a singular term in front of it), has to be abandoned if one\nis to accept the claim that there are nonexistent objects.\n\nThis entry is an examination of the many questions which arise in\nconnection with the view that there are nonexistent objects. The\nfollowing are particularly salient: What reasons are there (if any)\nfor thinking that there are nonexistent objects? If there are\nnonexistent objects, then what kind of objects are they? How can they\nbe characterized? Is it possible to provide a consistent theory of\nnonexistent objects? What is the explanatory force of a consistent\ntheory of nonexistent objects (if such a thing is possible)?\n",
