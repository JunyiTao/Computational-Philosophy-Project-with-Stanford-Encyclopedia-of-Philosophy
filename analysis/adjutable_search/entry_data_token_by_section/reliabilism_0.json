A Paradigm Shift in Analytic Epistemology\n\nIn the 1960s, a wide range of epistemologists were absorbed by the\nquestion: what does it take for a belief to amount to\nknowledge? It was generally agreed that for a person,\nS, to know some proposition p, at least three\nconditions must be met. First, p must be true. Second, S\nmust believe p. And third, S must be justified\nin believing p. Thus, knowledge requires justified true\nbelief. But does the satisfaction of these three conditions\nsuffice to entail that S knows p?\nUnfortunately, as Edmund Gettier (1963) showed with several convincing\ncases, justified true belief doesn\u2019t guarantee knowledge.\n\nSome subsequent attempts to explicate knowledge had broadly\n\u201creliabilist\u201d features, although they did not use this\nterminology. According to \u201crelevant alternatives\ntheories\u201d, a subject is said to know p provided that they\ncan \u201crule out\u201d relevant alternatives where p does\nnot obtain (Dretske 1970; Goldman 1976; Stine 1976; Lewis 1996).\nAccording to \u201ctruth-tracking theories\u201d, a subject knows\np provided their beliefs \u201ctrack the truth\u201d of\np across modal space. Truth-tracking theorists typically cash\nthis out in terms of subjunctive conditionals, such as\n\u201cSensitivity\u201d: If p had been false, S\nwouldn\u2019t have believed p (Nozick 1981), or\n\u201cSafety\u201d: If S were to believe p, p\nwould be true (Sosa 1999; Williamson 2000; Pritchard 2005). These\nviews are united by the idea that knowledge requires some form of\nreliability. (See the entry on the\n analysis of knowledge.)\n\nMeanwhile, many epistemologists have turned their attention to a\nrelated epistemic concept: the concept of (epistemic)\njustification. Justified belief is widely regarded as a\nnecessary\u2014though insufficient\u2014condition for\nknowledge. Hence, justification must be regarded as a core concept for\nepistemologists to explore and elucidate.\n\nHowever, justification also proves to be a very elusive concept. In\n1979 Alvin Goldman published a paper entitled \u201cWhat Is Justified\nBelief?\u201d, which departed from several well-entrenched positions\non the nature of epistemic justification. Years later, a number of\nepistemologists recognized this paper as marking a significant turning\npoint, or \u201cparadigm shift\u201d, in epistemology. Michael\nWilliams (2016: 3) called it \u201cthe Reliabilist Revolution\u201d.\nThis turning point has given rise to a lively debate about the kinds\nof factors that determine the epistemic status of a person\u2019s\nbeliefs or credences.\n",
