It was brought about by a\ngeneration of philosophers born around 1910, all of whom were trained\nas positivists, before breaking with it. The principal members of this\ngeneration\u2014called \u201cthe generation of founders\u201d by\nFrancisco Romero, and dubbed \u201cthe generation of\npatriarchs\u201d by Francisco Mir\u00f3 Quesada\u2014are well\nknown: Alejandro Korn (1860\u20131936) in Argentina, Alejandro\nOctavio De\u00fastua (1849\u20131945) in Peru, Jos\u00e9\nVasconcelos (1882\u20131959) and Antonio Caso (1883\u20131946) in\nMexico, Enrique Jos\u00e9 Molina (1871\u20131956) in Chile, Carlos\nVaz Ferreira (1872\u20131958) in Uruguay, and Raimundo de Farias\nBrito (1862\u20131917) in Brazil.\n\nThe adoption of ideas from France, and later from Germany, was\ninstrumental in formulating the basis for rejecting positivism. It\nbegan with the influence of Emile Boutroux (1845\u20131921), Henri\nBergson (1859\u20131941), and French vitalism and intuitionism. It\nwas cemented when the Spaniard Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset visited\nLatin America in 1916 and introduced the thought of Max Scheler\n(1874\u20131928), Nicolai Hartmann (1882\u20131950), and other\nGerman philosophers. Ortega y Gasset and the German philosophy of the\nspirit had substantial influence on the generation that followed that\nof the founders, called by Mir\u00f3 Quesada \u201cthe generation\nof forgers.\u201d Samuel Ramos (1897\u20131959), from Mexico,\nFrancisco Romero (1891\u20131962), from Argentina, Alceu Amoroso Lima\n(1893\u20131982), from Brazil, and Jos\u00e9 Carlos\nMari\u00e1tegui (1894\u20131930), from Peru, among others, followed\nthe founders\u2019 course, attacking positivist ideas and favoring in some\ninstances a rather poetic philosophical style that contrasts with the\nscientistic emphasis of positivism. They completed the process\ninitiated by the founders and laid the foundations of future\ndevelopments.\n\nOne of the main preoccupations of the founders and the generation that\nfollowed them was the absorption of European ideas; they wanted to be\nphilosophically up to date. In contrast with the objectives of the\nphilosophers that preceded them, which were for the most part\nreligious (during the colonial period), political (during the period\nof independence), or economic (during the nationalist period), the\nconcern of these thinkers was more systematically philosophical in\nmotivation.  This was a significant change in Latin American\nphilosophy, insofar as scholasticism, Enlightenment liberalism, and\npositivism were typically undertaken (at least in Latin American) for\npurposes frequently disconnected from a conception of philosophy in\nwhich the discipline was pursued for its own sake. For scholastics,\nthe primary objective was the apologetic defense of the faith; for\nliberals, the end was political emancipation; and for positivists, the\ngoal was national integration and economic and social progress. In all\nthree cases, European ideas were typically adopted with\npre-established ends in mind. As a consequence, philosophical\nmovements were not obviously the products of philosophical concerns as\nsuch. \n\nIn contrast to prior generations, the founders and those who followed\nthem did not tend to adopt European ideas with a view to the defense of\na body of doctrine, or in order to achieve certain practical ends of\npolitical liberation or of national unity and economic and social\nprogress. Their ideas arose from philosophical dissatisfactions with\npositivism. Thus, we find in the writings of Caso, De\u00fastua, and\nthe other founders who rebelled against positivism, purely\nphilosophical criticisms of that perspective. They were concerned, for\nexample, with freedom and the fact that determinism, which they\nconsidered undesirable, was a necessary corollary of\npositivism.  Still, their attitude toward the ideas\nthey adopted was seldom critical. They saw the defects of positivism,\nbut too often they still accepted uncritically the solutions they\nborrowed from non-positivist European philosophers to fight it.\n\nAlthough the founders and some of their immediate successors had\nattained some emancipation in the philosophical enterprise, full\nmaturity remained elusive. Still, the sophistication of some\nthinkers, such as Korn, was considerable and planted the critical seeds\nthat germinated in the following period.\n",
