    "main_text": "Doctrinal Analysis\n2. Doctrinal Analysis\n\nDoctrine organizes the vast legal materials of advanced societies as\nwell as legal education and much of legal scholarship. First year law\nstudents study basic common law courses such as tort and contract;\nupper year courses address subjects such as antitrust, business\norganizations, and administrative law. The casebooks in these courses\nare organized doctrinally. Similarly, legal scholars typically\nspecialize in the study of one or two doctrinal areas. \n\nPosner was trained as a lawyer. Posner [1973] was organized\ndoctrinally. Leff [1973] described Posner [1973] as a picaresque novel\nin which the eponymous protagonist Economic Analysis traveled down the\nriver of doctrinal subjects, offering insight into each set of legal\nrules. Most current work in the field still analyzes some doctrinal\nrule, typically assessing its efficiency.\n",
