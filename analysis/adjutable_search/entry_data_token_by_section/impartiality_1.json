    "main_text": "Morality and impartiality || The impartial point of view\n2.1 The impartial point of view\n\nIt is characteristic of modern moral thought to see impartiality as a\nrequirement of, if not a fundamental component of, morality. However,\nwhile nearly every moral theory requires some forms of impartiality in\nat least some contexts, and forbids some forms of partiality in at\nleast some contexts, there is little general agreement beyond that.\nOne straightforward thought is that to act morally is simply to act\nfrom the standpoint of impartial benevolence. Many writers have simply\nassumed that to assert the importance of impartiality in the context\nof morality just is to accept the idea of acting from such a\nperspective. It is generally agreed that some sort of close connection\nobtains between morality and impartiality. Indeed, the phrases\n\u2018moral point of view\u2019 and \u2018impartial (or\n\u2018impersonal\u2019) point of view\u2019 are sometimes used\ninterchangeably to refer to the imagined impersonal perspective from\nwhich, it is supposed, moral judgments are to be made (Baier 1958,\nchapter 8; Harsanyi 1982; Scheffler 1982, 1985; Smith 1976 [1759];\nWolf 1992; see also Blum 1980, Chapter 3). As noted above, however,\nthe word \u2018impartial\u2019 is a general term with many\nparticular species; it follows that the phrase \u2018impartial point\nof view\u2019 is itself ambiguous. At most, it might be that the\nmoral point of view constitutes one sort of impartial point of\nview.\n\nIt is not clear, however, that the demands of impartial benevolence\nare sufficient to exhaust those of morality. Treating a person\nappropriately and respectfully may well require certain sorts of\nemotional and/or cognitive responses: sensitivity to her needs and\nvalues, empathy for her suffering, and the like. But if these\nresponses are pictured as the results of positive traits or\nattributes (and not simply as, say, the result of a lack of bias or\nprejudice), then it is not clear that merely being impartial between\npersons is sufficient to guarantee that one will possess and display\nthe necessary sensitivities. Indeed, characterizations of impartial\nagents which proceed in negative terms (that is, by defining various\npreferences, emotions or bits of information that she does not possess\nor that do not move her) often risk picturing the impartial agent as\nimpersonal and even indifferent (Henberg 1978; Brandt 1954).\n\nA second problem for the claim that the moral point of view is\nidentical with (some version of) the impartial point of view \u2013\nor indeed, for any view which identifies morality and impartiality in\nthe direct sense \u2013 is that it seems plausible to regard some\nforms of moral partiality as morally admirable, and perhaps even\nmorally required (Blum 1980; Cottingham 1983, 1986, 1996; Jeske &\nFumerton 1997; Jollimore 2001; Kapur 1991; Kekes 1981; Keller 2013;\nMacIntyre 1984; Oldenquist 1982). Loyalty to one\u2019s family,\ncommunity or country, for instance, is commonly regarded as a virtue.\nYet such an attitude is a clear and indeed paradigmatic example of\npartiality, requiring that an agent feel and act differently toward\none set of persons than she does toward humanity in general.\nSimilarly, certain specific moral duties arising from certain\nparticular relationships seem to involve partiality in an irreducible\nmanner. Parents, for example, are thought to be morally obliged to\ntake special care of their own children; to regard one\u2019s child\nas merely one among millions would be regarded as highly eccentric if\nnot monstrous. Of course, some moral duties do require that an agent\nbe impartial in performing them. But on common sense moral views at\nleast, impartiality seems mostly to be required in the context of\nspecific roles \u2013 such as when a person is acting as a judge, an\numpire, a journalist, or a representative of some public institution;\nor, perhaps, when we are evaluating and selecting first-order moral\nrules. (Baron 1991; Blum 1980; Cottingham 1983). The idea that\nimpartiality is a pervasive and universal moral requirement that\nshould be directly manifested in our thoughts and practices during\ndaily life seems to contradict our ordinary moral intuitions.\n\nOne can, though, grant impartiality a significant, even central and\nfoundational, role while allowing that our actions and motives may\noften be partial in nature. As Brad Hooker has pointed out, there are\nat least three levels at which assessments of moral impartiality may\nbe made. First, one may ask whether moral rules are being impartially\napplied. Second, impartial benevolence may be used as a direct guide\nto practical decisions. And third, the content of first-order moral\nrules may be assessed from an impartial standpoint (Hooker 2010) More\nrecently he has suggested that for the purposes of moral and political\nphilosophy, it may be less useful to focus, as Gert\u2019s analysis\ndoes, on the notion of impartial treatment, than on\n\u201cimpartiality in the application of rules\u201d and\n\u201cimpartiality in justification of behavior.\u201d After all, he\nwrites, \u201cimpartial treatment, according to [Gert\u2019s]\naccount of it, not only is not always a moral requirement but also is\nsometimes morally forbidden\u201d (Hooker 2013, 722). According to\nHooker\u2019s account of impartial application of rules, \u201cWhen\na rule is applied across a set of cases, the rule is not applied\nimpartially if and only if both (a) the agent is at least sometimes\nguided by partiality and (b) this conflicts with being guided by the\ndistinctions identified by the rule as pivotal\u201d (2013, 721). The\nanalysis is intended to allow that some rules might (legitimately)\nrequire partiality\u2014for instance, a rule requiring parents to\ntake care of their own children. Such a rule could nonetheless be\npartially or impartially applied, and agents might be blameworthy for\nfailing to apply them impartially even when they are not blameworthy\nfor engaging in the various forms of partiality that are required by\nthe rule.\n\nHooker himself, then, adheres to the view that an adequate moral\ntheory \u201cputs forward an impartial foundational principle for\nassessing possible moral rules, and this impartial foundational\nprinciple selects rules that allow considerable scope for\npartiality,\u201d seeing both contractualism and rule\nconsequentialism as examples of theories of this sort. (See (Hooker,\n2000) for his development of a particular rule consequentialist view.)\nSuch a theory would admit various forms of morally admirable and even\nmorally required partiality, while holding that the rules permitting\nsuch partiality are countenanced by, and perhaps even reducible to,\nimpartial moral principles.\n\nWhether irreducible morally admirable partiality exists is frequently\nseen as the main issue separating the so-called partialists\nfrom the impartialists. Partialists, in general, tend to\nclaim that morally admirable partiality does exist, that it cannot be\nreduced to any form of impartiality at a more fundamental level, and\nthat these facts pose a serious problem for those who claim that\nmorality and (some form of) impartiality are identical, or even\nclosely related. Impartialists, by contrast, either deny the existence\nof morally admirable partiality altogether, or hold that any apparent\ncases are in fact ultimately reducible to impartial standards (see\nsection 6). Thus impartialists hold that \u2013 contrary, perhaps, to\nappearances \u2013 impartiality is, indeed, a pervasive and universal\nrequirement of morality.\n",
