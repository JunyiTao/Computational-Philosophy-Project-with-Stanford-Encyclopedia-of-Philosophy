    "preamble": "\n\nFrench philosophers of the Ancien R\u00e9gime wrote treatises on\nbeauty or taste; the term \u201caesthetics\u201d, coined in Latin as\n\u201caesthetica\u201d by German philosopher Alexander\nBaumgarten in 1735 (\u00a7116), was not in popular usage in France and\nappeared only in rare instances at the end of the eighteenth century.\nPhilosophers described taste (\u201cgo\u00fbt\u201d or\n\u201cgoust\u201d) as a sentiment that allowed both\ncreators and consumers to discern the beauty of an object. At times,\nauthors focused more on the object, such as a painting; at other\ntimes, they examined what was happening inside the mind of the person\nwho created it or of the person who looked at it.\n\nEighteenth-century theories of beauty were in many ways a continuation\nof debates that took place during the previous century. The changes\nthat were introduced during the Enlightenment included an increased\nfocus on the mind\u2019s inner workings when perceiving beauty and\nattempts at finding universal standards that could be applied to all\nobjects. These two features are what twentieth-century philosopher\nErnst Cassirer called \u201cempirical\u201d and\n\u201cCartesian\u201d tendencies in eighteenth-century aesthetics.\nIn the second part of the century, major Enlightenment philosophers\nsuch as Voltaire and Diderot claimed that the authority to judge was\nno longer in the hands of worldly amateurs or of little-known\nacademics but in those of professional critics such as themselves.\n\nDebates about artistic matters were greatly influenced by the new\nspaces and means of communication that emerged in the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries. Critics expressed their judgments in published\ntreatises and in periodicals such as Le Mercure galant;\nphilosophical ideas were also developed in oral conversations between\nmembers of the newly founded royal academies, within elite coteries in\nprivate salons, and among men in public caf\u00e9s. Discussions\nsometimes even became rowdy in spaces such as the opera house or the\ntheater, which were accessible to people of\u00a0all genders and\nsocial classes. The increasingly literate public called for the right\nto make artistic judgments, while intellectuals were only beginning to\ndistinguish themselves as professionals with institutional\ncredentials, so it is impossible to discuss philosophy in isolation\nfrom milieu or means of communication in the eighteenth century.\n\nMany artistic debates, recorded for posterity as a succession of\nquerelles or quarrels\u2014were highly polemical and often\ndevolved into ad hominem satirical attacks. Among the most\nfamous, one can list the quarrel over the play Le Cid and the\nQuarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, both of which originated in\nthe seventeenth century but which had implications for the next\ncentury. In painting, one could cite the quarrel between fans of\nPoussin, who privileged line, and fans of Rubens, who favored color.\nIn opera, the Querelle des Bouffons pitted most Enlightenment\nphilosophers, who preferred melody and a populist Italian style,\nagainst the fans of composer Rameau, who represented a more erudite\napproach to French harmony.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, discussions of beauty and\ntaste dealt with a variety of objects, including visual arts,\nliterature, music, human bodies, food, and manners. This article will\nconcentrate on the areas that received the most attention from\nwriters: literature and the visual arts. Questions at stake included:\nHow can one define beauty\u2014via the senses, reason, or\nconventional rules? How does the human mind perceive a beautiful\nobject? Who has the right to judge? None of these questions were\ndefinitively answered, but Enlightenment ideas of beauty shaped the\nlegacy of classical French culture, not only for France to this day,\nbut for the whole Western world that it dominated during the\neighteenth century.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Classical Legacy\n\nFrench thinkers considered their country as the heir to the Greek and\nRoman empires. Whether they strictly followed ancient models or not,\nthey saw their work as a continuation of the classical tradition.\nAristotle, Horace, and Plutarch, to name just a few writers, were\nmajor influences on the literature of seventeenth and eighteenth\ncentury France. This self-image of the French explains not only their\ndiscomfort with artistic innovation, but also their disparagement of\nother European countries, their anxieties about what to include in\ntheir national literary canon, and their efforts to impose a\nmasculine, patriotic aesthetic on the painting of the era.\n\nThis loyalty to the Greco-Roman tradition came into conflict with some\nnew ideas in the mid-seventeenth century during the Quarrel of the\nAncients and the Moderns. The quarrel had several phases that focused\non different problems and it spanned approximately seven decades. The\nearliest phase began in the 1650s when a handful of authors attempted\nto renew the genre of epic poetry, since everyone acknowledged that\nthe French had never created their own equivalent to the\nAeneid, as the Italians had done (Tasso\u2019s Jerusalem\nDelivered, 1581) and as the English would soon do (Milton\u2019s\nParadise Lost, 1667). To name just two examples, Desmarets de\nSaint-Sorlin and Jean Chapelain wrote poems following epic conventions\nbut with Christian subjects: the conversion of the first French king\nClovis and the story of Joan of Arc, respectively. These poems were\npublicly mocked by partisans of the Ancient camp, most notably by\nNicolas Boileau, a poet with powerful support at court. Whether these\nChristian epics failed because of their literary qualities or because\nBoileau\u2019s satires were so successful in swaying public opinion,\nthey have now been largely forgotten.\n\nAfter these attempts at modernizing the epic, the next phase of the\nQuarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns focused on other aspects of\nmodern life. This time, Boileau faced a new opponent, Charles\nPerrault, now best known as a compiler of fairy tales. In fact, fairy\ntales were significant because they celebrated the European oral\ntradition that did not have Greco-Roman roots, in contrast to the\nfables of La Fontaine, who was a partisan of the Ancients. Perrault\ntook a stand for the Modern side by writing Parallel of the\nAncients and the Moderns (1688\u201397), a series of dialogues\nbetween three interlocutors: an abbot who represents the Modern camp,\na pr\u00e9sident or high-level administrator who represents\nthe Ancient camp, and a cavalier who tries to reconcile the two points\nof view. At stake was the view of human history as one of degeneration\nor of progress: the Ancients beheld Antiquity as the Golden Age, so\nsubsequent history could only represent a deterioration\u2014in the\narts, in morals, and in other aspects of life. The Moderns saw new\ninventions and scientific discoveries as signs of an upward trend.\nEven in terms of manners, the Moderns claimed that the newly developed\nFrench courtly politeness was an improvement on the rough, though\nheroic, behavior of the Ancient Romans and Greeks. For example, in\nPerrault\u2019s dialogue, the Modern partisan objects to the mention\nin the Iliad that Zeus could beat his wife Hera, whereas that\nbehavior was considered taboo among the upper classes of Ancien\nR\u00e9gime France. The abbot even compares Zeus\u2019 behavior to\nthat of a French peasant. This contrast between ancient Greek and\nEarly Modern French codes of conduct would reappear in the next phase\nof the Quarrel.\n\nThe final phase of the Quarrel, in the 1710s, mainly centered on how\nHomer\u2019s Iliad should be translated. The two most\nprominent players were Anne Dacier and the abb\u00e9 Houdar de la\nMotte. Dacier, a distinguished Hellenic scholar, produced her prose\ntranslation of the Iliad in 1711; based on this work, Houdar,\nwho knew little Greek, published a radically shortened poetic version\nin 1714. In his preface, Houdar represented the Modern camp by daring\nto criticize Homer, and in the main text, he not only cut out parts of\nthe Iliad that he considered too repetitive or long-winded,\nsuch as the description of Achilles\u2019s shield, but he also\nremoved the sections in which the manners of the Ancients appeared too\nuncouth for his taste. In contrast, Anne Dacier advocated for a more\nfaithful translation and showed less regard for the French sense of\npoliteness. She struck against the Moderns in her polemic On the\nCorruption of Taste (1714), deploring the effeminate morals and\nliterature of her contemporaries, in contrast to the heroic ones of\nAntiquity.\n\nIn all phases of the quarrel, all parties agreed that Antiquity should\nbe admired and at no time was the Greco-Roman canon put into question.\nAncient literature was the core of boys\u2019 education in Ancien\nR\u00e9gime France and it remained the standard for French\nintellectuals until the end of the eighteenth century, in spite of\npopular new developments in the novel and theater. After the Quarrel\nof the Ancients and the Moderns, Enlightenment writers reconciled both\nsides by recognizing scientific innovations and improvements in\nlifestyle without losing their desire to imitate ancient literary\nforms or admire the grandeur of ancient heroes.\n\nThis long quarrel had largely concerned whether writers had properly\napplied literary rules. This ancient method for evaluating literature,\nwhich we can observe as early as in Aristotle\u2019s\nPoetics, aimed to determine whether literary works correctly\nfollowed the conventions of, say, genre, diction, or the decorum that\nwas based on characters\u2019 social category. While some French\nthinkers were still approaching literature this way, others were\ndeveloping new ways of judging beauty\u2014artistic and\notherwise\u2014at the cognitive level. The sides they took in debates\nnot only reflected the way they reasoned, but their social milieu and\ntheir institutional status.\n2. Salon Culture and Sensibility\n\nEarly in the Ancien R\u00e9gime, in 1635, the government of Louis\nXIII, controlled by Cardinal de Richelieu, established the\nAcad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, with the mission of standardizing\nthe French language. Before this institution came into being, there\nhad been literary circles, which later scholars called\nsalons, run by upper-class women and men for their select\nguests, that had fostered the production of new writings and held\ndebates about how to refine the French language. The Acad\u00e9mie\nFran\u00e7aise brought some of this activity under national\nauthority, granted it royal patronage, and controlled the membership,\nlimiting it to exactly 40 men. Nevertheless, salons continued their\nwork for the next centuries; they continued to patronize emerging\ntalents and exerted a great influence on public reception of the\narts.\n\nSeventeenth-century salon culture developed concepts of taste that\nwere closely aligned with an aristocratic view of politeness and\nsensibility. Cassirer calls this approach \u201cempiricist\u201d\nand, indeed, these ideas were dependent on the senses and the stimuli\nthey received, more than on reason or on conventions of genre.\n\nAn early influential thinker was Dominique Bouhours, a Jesuit and\nfrequent guest at salons who wrote Entretiens d\u2019Ariste et\nd\u2019Eug\u00e8ne, a series of dialogues about good taste. In\nthis work, he deals with the arts, particularly eloquence, but also\nmanners. Bouhours is best known for coining the term je ne sais\nquoi or \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u201d\u2014a special,\nundefinable quality that transcends any rules. His interlocutors evoke\nthe possibility that a work of art could follow all the rules yet fail\nto please, if it lacks that special something. They compare the je\nne sais quoi in the arts to the ineffable in the contemplation of\nnature or in Catholic theology. In another part of his\nEntretiens, Bouhours denounces exaggeration or excessive\nornamentation in language: a common trope in works about rhetoric\nsince Antiquity. His interlocutors apply this idea to\nseventeenth-century Europe when they agree that, with its simplicity\nand modesty, the French language is superior to bombastic Spanish and\neffeminate Italian. These linguistic prejudices indicate to us that\nBouhours was trying to establish the status of France as the cultural\nheir to the Roman empire, in opposition to the two most dominant\ncultures in Europe in his era.\n\nIn Bouhours\u2019 text, politeness and artistic taste are closely\ntied, since it takes a special sense of discernment to perceive\nliterary beauty as well as the right thing to say in a social setting.\nBoth supposedly emanate from the acute sensibility of a refined person\nwho is accustomed to being surrounded by beauty and good manners. The\nclass implications of his ideas about taste are clear to see: only\nthose members of an elite had the instinct for both exquisite\npoliteness and exquisite artistic taste. It denies the possibility\nthat just anyone could receive enough training to reach this level of\nrefinement, an idea that would be shared by later theorists that\nemerged from this salon culture.\n\nThe abb\u00e9 Dubos, the marquise de Lambert, and Montesquieu, among\nothers, continued this line of thought in the early eighteenth\ncentury. They belonged to a group of acquaintances that frequented the\nsame social circles, including Lambert\u2019s own salon. Because\ntheir reflections on taste were closely tied to their sense of worldly\npoliteness, they shared a disdain for professional critics and any\nsemblance of pedantry. They were less concerned with defining beauty\nand more intent on examining what happens in the mind and body of the\nviewer when she contemplates a pleasing object. Their emphasis on\npleasure and sentiment was sensualist, based on input from the senses;\nin Montesquieu\u2019s case, sensualism becomes frankly\nhedonistic.\n\nJean-Baptiste Dubos, in his Critical Reflections on Poetry,\nPainting, and Music (1719), presents the faculty of taste as a\nsentiment that he calls a sixth sense, disregarding the role of reason\nor of morality, which his contemporary Jean-Pierre Crousaz had\nconsidered important aspects of taste. His work precedes Scottish\nphilosopher Francis Hutcheson\u2019s aesthetic treatise of 1725, in\nwhich he also discusses a sixth sense that perceives beauty. According\nto Dubos, the reception of artistic works happens in the body: we\ntremble, cry, or feel a jolt of surprise when we see a play, for\nexample. He describes how the arts affect our emotions positively,\nwhile admitting that the effect of seeing death depicted in painting\nor theater, for example, is different than if we were to witness a\ndeath in real life. He also goes into great detail to describe how\nclimate affects nations and consequently how it fosters or impedes the\nproliferation of good artists in certain parts of the world. This type\nof thinking began as far back as Hippocrates\u2019s reflections on\nthe effects of climate on national character and extends to Juan\nHuarte\u2019s thoughts on the influence of body temperature on\neloquence and later to Montesquieu\u2019s claims about the way\nclimate determines human behavior and consequently each nation\u2019s\npolitical system. This climate theory is part of Dubos\u2019s idea\nthat artistic perception happens in the body, both for the viewer and\nfor the creator. For him, art is ultimately a means of communication\nfrom body to body.\n\nOne misunderstanding that has arisen about Dubos is the assumption\nthat he democratizes taste, because in some passages of the\nReflections, he states that the \u201cpublic\u201d and\n\u201ctout le monde\u201d can be susceptible to the proper\nreception of artworks. However, in other passages he explains what he\nmeans by these terms: \u201ctout le monde\u201d does not\nmean \u201ceveryone\u201d, as it is usually translated: he in fact\nuses \u201cle monde\u201d to mean high society, also called\n\u201cle beau monde\u201d in the eighteenth century. As for\nthe general public, he explicitly excludes \u201cthe lower class of\npeople\u201d from \u201cthe public capable of passing judgment on\npoems or pictures\u201d (Dubos, Critical Reflections,\nII:245).\n\nLike Dubos, the marquise de Lambert writes about good taste as a\nsentiment of pleasure, or agr\u00e9ment, in her\nReflections on Taste. A person\u2019s correct judgment\ndepends on her degree of sensibility, and Lambert claims it cannot be\nlearned; instead,\n\n\nNature gives us what we have of it, we never can acquire it, and the\nmore refined Part of the World alone are acquainted with it in any\nDegree of Perfection. (Lambert 1748: 217 [1790: 183])\n\n\nShe disregards definitions of beauty that are based on rules, perhaps\nbecause these can be learned. In fact, she dismisses the concept of\nbeauty from her thoughts on taste and privileges the\n\u201cagr\u00e9able\u201d, which can be translated as\n\u201cagreeable\u201d or \u201cpleasant\u201d:\n\n\nthough Beauty has Rules, Agreeableness has none. The [beautiful]\nwithout the Agreeable can never give us a delicate Pleasure; the\nAgreeable is the native Subject of Taste, and \u2019tis thence that\nit pleases us infinitely beyond the [beautiful]; and it is as\narbitrary and variable, even as the Taste itself. (Lambert 1748: 217\n[1790: 184])\n\n\nThe impossibility of establishing definitive parameters for taste is a\ncontinuation of Bouhours\u2019 \u201cje ne sais quoi\u201d, which\nrelies on a sensitive person\u2019s instinctive ability to recognize\nan appropriately pleasing object.\n\nThe marquise de Lambert\u2019s views were echoed in the works of\nother writers of her circle, such as the abb\u00e9 Trublet and\nCartaud de la Vilate (she also hosted both Anne Dacier and Houdar de\nla Motte). Cartaud de la Vilate places particular emphasis on\ndelicacy, which is\n\n\nan exquisite discernment that nature has placed in certain organs for\nsorting out the different virtues of the objects that pertain to\nsentiment. (Cartaud de la Vilate 1726: 235 [translation by J.\nTsien])\n\n\nThese ideas of inborn sensibility to pleasing artistic objects refute\nthe possibility that taste can be learned.\n\nMontesquieu also examines taste as a function of the viewer\u2019s\nmind, through the filter of the same milieu of worldly refinement. The\nexamples to which he applies his aesthetic ideas are not exclusively\nartistic: he includes activities like flirting, gambling, and social\ndancing, alongside more conventional topics such as architecture, to\ndescribe how the mind perceives pleasure. He explains these ideas in\nhis Essay on Taste, which appears in Diderot and\nd\u2019Alembert\u2019s Encyclop\u00e9die under the entry\n\u201cGo\u00fbt\u201d (1757), an entry which also includes\ntreatises on the same subject by Voltaire and d\u2019Alembert. To\ndescribe what objects please our minds, Montesquieu lists six\nqualities: order, variety, symmetry, contrasts, the ability to provoke\ncuriosity, and the ability to provoke surprise. Each of these\nqualities in excess has a bad effect, he claims, such as a Gothic\ncathedral that offers too much variety and confuses us. On the other\nhand, too much order and symmetry, for example in a long colonnade or\nin a beautiful woman\u2019s face, can bore the onlooker. Like\nLambert, Montesquieu states that he is more interested in pleasure\nthan beauty; as an example, he claims to prefer a woman with irregular\nfeatures who can surprise him to a perfectly beautiful woman. To the\nsix qualities of pleasing objects above, he adds three ways in which\nour minds experience these objects: sensibility, delicacy, and the\nje ne sais quoi. These terms remind us of his allegiance to\nthe Bouhours-Dubos-salon line of thought about taste as a quality\ninherent in certain refined, worldly people.\n3. Cartesian Beauty\n\nAlthough this turn towards subjectivism and sensualism represented a\nmajor innovation in aesthetics, Descartes was still a dominant\ninfluence on French thought of the eighteenth century, and his\nphilosophy was applied to theories of beauty, even though he wrote\nlittle on the topic. Scholars such as Crousaz and Andr\u00e9\nproposed objective measures of beauty, as Descartes did with truth,\nthat could be applied to any object. This standard would ideally\ntranscend the vicissitudes of fashion, personal biases, or cultural\ndifferences.\n\nJean-Pierre de Crousaz, a professor of logic and mathematics in\nLausanne, Switzerland, published his Treatise on Beauty in\n1715. He does not offer original ideas on the nature of the beautiful;\nhe takes up the old dictum that it is a mix of unity and diversity, so\nas to preserve order and proportion from both caprice and monotony.\nBut he approaches it with a new awareness of the constraints and\nprejudices that obstruct the way:\n\n\nEveryone possesses [an idea of the beautiful], but since it hardly\never appears alone we do not reflect upon it and fail to distinguish\nit from the tangle of other ideas which appear alongside it. (1715\n[AT: 390])\n\n\nThe root of this difficulty lies in the duality of human\nfaculties:\n\n\nSometimes ideas and feelings are in agreement with each other and an\nobject merits the qualification \u201cbeautiful\u201d on both\ncounts. Sometimes, however, reason and feelings are at war with each\nother and then an object pleases and at the same time does not: from\none perspective it is beautiful, while from another it lacks beauty.\n(1715 [AT: 392])\n\n\nCrousaz is not satisfied with this duality; on the contrary, he\nbelieves we have a responsibility to discover\n\n\nwhich principles regulate our approbation when we judge something from\nideas only [or, as he likes to say, \u201ccoolly\u201d] and find it\nbeautiful independently of feeling. (1715 [AT: 393])\n\n\nTaste is a forerunner of what reason would have approved, had it time\nenough to weigh everything relevant to a judgment. Crousaz finally\nreconciles knowledge with sensations, a fact that appears to testify\nin favor of God\u2019s wisdom. Similar ideas are also to be found in\nminor authors such as Frain du Tremblay, Brumoy, or Trublet.\n\nYves-Marie Andr\u00e9\u2019s Essay on Beauty (1741) covers\nthe same territory, but with a strong influence from Malebranche. In\naccordance with the Cartesian distinction between ideas (innate,\nadventitious, and fictitious), Andr\u00e9 suggests several notions\nof beauty. Essential beauty is \u201cindependent of any\ninstitution, even divine\u201d and so is identified with what is\nuniversal, immutable, and recognizable by divine Reason.\nNatural beauty concerns the whole range of created things; it\nis \u201cindependent of any human opinion\u201d but follows from\nGod\u2019s will; it is present in the harmony and finality of nature.\nThe lowest degree of beauty is the product of human activity and is\npartly arbitrary, because it combines intellectual as well as sensual\ningredients. This arbitrary beauty that speaks to the eye and\near is itself organized into three levels: genius, taste, and caprice\n(in descending order). Only genius is recognizable by our reason, when\nthe latter is adequately supported by other faculties. Andr\u00e9\nsummarizes:\n\n\nI call beautiful not what pleases to imagination\u2019s first\nsight\u2014but what has a right to please reason and reflection by\nits own excellence. (Essay on Beauty quoted in Becq 1994: 419\n[translation by J. Morizot])\n\n\nFor him, there is no distinction between beauty and\ntruth, and this is the very definition of the aesthetics of\nperfection. But aesthetic feeling is a normal affective accompaniment\nof any act of creation or reception, and the distinguishing feature of\nhumankind as a species.\n\nCharles Batteux had somewhat different goals. When he published\nThe Fine Arts Reduced to a Single Principle in 1746, he took\nup a challenge: to establish Aristotelian ideas firmly as the general\nbasis for a unified system of the arts. The main concept on which he\nfocuses is mimesis, but generalized to any kind of art (thus\ngoing beyond Aristotle or Horace). To achieve this generalization, he\ndistinguishes the liberal arts, of which the object is pleasure (i.e.,\nmusic, poetry, painting, sculpture, and dance), from the mechanical\nones, and he proposes an interpretation of what amounts to the\n\u201cimitation of the beautiful nature\u201d (Batteux 1746). He\ninsists that imitation is not a matter of slavishly copying the given,\nbut a sensible and enlightened process that struggles its way forward\nto the best result. Recalling the famous anecdote of Zeuxis who\ncomposed his Helen out of parts taken from Crotone\u2019s\nmost perfect women, he concludes that the artist has the\nresponsibility to imitate what reason decides is nature\u2019s\nessence. That is why Batteux praises artifice so much: \u201cart is\nmade for fooling\u201d (Batteux 1746), not because it is inherently\nduplicitous but because truth is a complex construction that hides its\nstructure and development. Of course, the problem of taste remains\nunresolved when we ask how the artist selects the parts that he will\nassemble in his imitation of \u201cbeautiful nature\u201d: by what\nstandard does he determine that a certain part of nature is\nbeautiful?\n\nIt is also important to mention composer Jean-Philippe Rameau, who\npassionately adhered to Cartesian thought. In his Treatise on\nHarmony (1722), he attempted to lay the scientific foundations of\nmusic, and codifies many of the ideas that are the basis of our\nanalysis of music to this day (e.g., tonality, major vs. minor keys,\nprinciples of composition and accompaniment). For Rameau, harmony is\nmore fundamental to music than melody. Nonetheless, from the\nDemonstration of the principle of harmony (1750) on, and\nafter the so-called Querelle des bouffons or \u201cQuarrel\nof Buffoons\u201d, where Rousseau took him to task (in his Letter\nabout French Music 1753, a libel in favor of the Italian opera),\nRameau retreated to the certainty that music is the universal\n\u201ckey\u201d to any subject whatsoever, including geometry.\n4. The Enlightenment Philosophes\n\nAfter Montesquieu, the other philosophers of the Enlightenment\nborrowed from the theories mentioned above to come up with their\ndescriptions of taste as a combination of three elements: sentiment,\nreason, and a knowledge of rules. Simultaneously, they distanced\nthemselves from both the refined world of salons that had promoted\ntheir careers and the academics who had developed theories of beauty.\nEven Montesquieu criticized salons as having a feminizing influence\nthat discouraged serious scholarship. Meanwhile, Voltaire describes\nscholars as myopic and dust-covered in his poem The Temple of\nTaste (1733). The majority of Enlightenment philosophers saw\nthemselves as erudite, serious thinkers who also lived in society. In\nterms of taste, they set themselves off as a caste of professional\ncritics who claimed the right to make artistic judgments that were\nmore authoritative than the potentially wayward preferences of the\ngeneral public.\n\nVoltaire describes good taste as a combination of sentiment and\nerudition. In his article \u201cTaste\u201d in the\nEncyclop\u00e9die, he gives the example of a young man who\ncries at a theatrical performance. Voltaire demands that this\nspontaneous reaction eventually be backed up by an understanding of\nthe reasons why the play had this effect on him\u2014namely, rules\nsuch as the Aristotelean unities. The experience is similar to that\ndescribed by Crousaz, except that the latter describes the ideal\nartistic reception as an immediate sentiment that is later confirmed\nby reason rather than rules. As for more extensive thoughts on beauty,\nhowever, Voltaire scholars affirm in their works devoted to his role\nas critic that he did not have an all-encompassing aesthetic theory.\nInstead, he made pronouncements on taste in the arts on a case-by-case\nbasis, with a clear preference for Greco-Roman conventions, but still\nwilling to make exceptions for certain passages by great writers who\nbroke these rules, such as Shakespeare.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau wrote little about taste and beauty, only\ndiatribes about the corrupting influence of the arts in general and a\nfew pieces about musical composition. It was Marmontel, his fellow\nphilosophe, who attempted to create a theory of taste\nextrapolated from Rousseau\u2019s philosophy. In his Essai sur le\ngo\u00fbt, which prefaces his \u00c9l\u00e9ments de\nlitt\u00e9rature (1787), Marmontel determines, like Batteux and\nmany others, that good taste is based on nature. He then recounts a\nseries of stages in which man passes from good taste to bad taste and\nthen back to good. First there are the \u201csavage men\u201d who\nexpress themselves with eloquence but no \u201cexcessive\nhyperbole\u201d or \u201csuperfluous epithet\u201d. In\nMarmontel\u2019s system, the second stage is that of the\n\u201cuncultured\u201d or \u201cbarbaric\u201d man, who prefers\nartificial and convoluted language. Alienated from nature, he has been\ncorrupted by luxury, vanity, and the whims of fashion. This bad taste\ncan be compared to Andr\u00e9\u2019s lowest type of taste, which he\ncalls arbitrary, because it is capricious and constantly changing.\nFinally, in Marmontel\u2019s model, the \u201ccivilized man\u201d\nemerges in the third stage, when he returns to a modified nature. This\ntrajectory is clearly based on Rousseau\u2019s schema, as he recounts\nit in his political works, of the noble savage who becomes corrupted\nby society, and who finally, in some unspecified future, will see\nsociety self-destruct and, in a way, come full circle to the beginning\nagain. Aside from these ideas, Marmontel\u2019s poetics were a return\nto a conventional system of classification of figures of style,\ncompatible with his contemporary Dumarsais\u2019 listing of\ntropes.\n\nDiderot\u2019s monumental article \u201cBeau\u201d of the\nEncyclop\u00e9die contains one of the best summaries of\nFrench aesthetic thought in the eighteenth century, as well as some\nnew ideas for artistic judgment. Early in the article, he exposes the\ncircular reasoning inherent to theories of beauty: according to Saint\nAugustine, unity is the defining characteristic of beauty\u2014a\nsymmetrical building would be an example. \u201cBut why is symmetry\nnecessary?\u201d asks Diderot, who answers himself, \u201cBecause it\npleases\u201d. \u201cWhy does it please?\u201d he continues,\n\u201cBecause it is beautiful\u201d. \u201cWhy is it beautiful?\nBecause it is unified\u201d. Unable to resolve this problem, he then\ngoes on to summarize the theories of beauty by Andr\u00e9 and\nCrousaz, as well as by Hutcheson and German philosopher Christian\nWolff. While Diderot claims to consider Andr\u00e9\u2019s treatise\nthe most profound and coherent, he still objects to the necessity of\ninnate ideas about what is beautiful. Instead, Diderot argues that all\nconceptions of symmetry, proportion, and beauty come from our\nobservations.\n\nHis own definition of taste depends on what he calls\n\u201crapports\u201d, or connections between various aspects of a\nwork. An artist creates these rapports and the most refined, the most\nerudite, and the most sensitive viewer is the one who can discern the\nlargest number of them. His prime example is a line from\nHorace, a 1640 tragedy by Corneille: \u201cqu\u2019il\nmour\u00fbt\u201d or \u201cthat he had died\u201d. Diderot\nexplains that these words in isolation are neither beautiful nor ugly.\nBut if one knows the context within the plot of the play, that this is\nthe answer that a father gives when asked what he would have his son\ndo in battle, the listener finds more interest in the line. Diderot\nadds several other circumstances from the play, for instance, that\nthis is the only surviving son, that he is alone against three\nenemies, and that he is fighting for the honor of his country, that\ncreate more rapports in the mind of the listener, until this\nultra-concise line becomes an object of great beauty. The rapports\ndescribed here involve understanding more and more of the plot and of\nthe human relationships depicted, which add layers of meaning to\ncertain lines. In his Lettre sur les sourds et muets,\ntranslated as Letter on the Deaf and Dumb (1751b), Diderot\nexplains something similar, using the term \u201chieroglyphics\u201d\nrather than \u201crapports\u201d. He gives the example of a poem in\nwhich men of taste can see a much larger number of\n\u201chieroglyphs\u201d or elements of prosody, than ordinary\npeople; in other words, they can do what literary scholars call a\nclose reading. What is not clear, however, is how people can reach the\nstage of refinement where they are able to discern more rapports or\n\u201chieroglyphs\u201d.\n5. Painting: of Amateurs and Professionals\n\nAs debates about taste in literature and music were taking place,\nother debates arose in the world of visual arts. Artists felt a new\nauthority to theorize publicly about their work, even though in 1719\nDubos still referred to them as \u201cartisans\u201d, harking back\nto an era in which artists had no more prestige than other skilled\nmanual laborers. However, Louis XIV had established the Royal Academy\nof Painting and Sculpture in 1648 and thus gave these former artisans\na special status. He named Charles Le Brun, who occupied the role of\nFirst Painter to the King, as the founding director of this Academy.\nIts leaders created a set of apprenticeships and tests that the\naspirants had to pass in order to be formally accepted. Painters,\ndepending on how they wished to be received, could present a master\nwork in the \u201cgrand genre\u201d: that is, a historic,\nmythological, or religious scene. Otherwise, they could undertake some\nof the minor genres, which were, in descending hierarchical order,\nportraits, landscapes, \u201cgenre\u201d scenes that represented\ndaily life, and lastly, still lifes.\n\nOne major querelle occurred in the seventeenth century\nbetween proponents of line and those of color, or between the\nPoussinists and Rubenists. For a long time, color had been\ndisregarded, for at least three reasons: it is, in Charles Le\nBrun\u2019s words, \u201cbut an accident produced by the reflection\nof light and that varies according to circumstances\u201d (1672 [AT:\n183]); it appeals to sensuality whereas \u201cwe must not judge by\nour senses alone but by reason\u201d as Poussin puts it in a letter\nto Chantelou dated 24 November 1647 (AT: 69); and it proves unable to\nserve as a foundation for painting, unlike drawing, which is related\nto the mind (the original sense of disegno = drawing or\ndesign).\n\nThe painter Gabriel Blanchard cautiously started to endorse the use of\ncolor in the Academy in 1671. He did not want to \u201cdiminish the\nimportance of design\u201d but to\n\n\nestablish three things in defense of color: first, that color is just\nas necessary to the art of painting as design; secondly, that if we\ndiminish the worth of color, we thereby also diminish the worth of\npainters; and thirdly, that color merited the praise of the Ancients,\nand that it merits it again in our own age. (1671 [AT:\n178\u2013179])\n\n\nDesign is a necessary foundation, certainly, but if the aim of the\npainter is \u201cboth to deceive the eyes and to imitate\nnature\u201d, it is reasonable to conclude that color serves that\ngoal best, because \u201cherein lies the difference that\ndistinguishes painting from all the other arts and which gives\npainting its own specific end\u201d (AT: 180). This was clearly an\nattempt to turn to his advantage Poussin\u2019s phrase that the aim\nof painting is delectation\u2014but insufficient indeed to convince\nLe Brun.\n\nTwo men were going to play a special role in the color crusade. It may\nseem odd to mention royal historiographer Andr\u00e9 F\u00e9libien\nfirst because he is generally and rightly considered as a supporter of\nPoussin. But he was also liberal-minded, respectful of differing\nopinions (it was to cost him his position!) and anxious to find a fair\nbalance between the gifts of the mind and the talents of the hand. For\nhim, \u201cbeauty is a result of the proportion and symmetry between\ncorporeal and material parts\u201d (1725 [AT: 220]), so that color\ncannot be discarded since\n\n\neverything should appear so artfully connected that the whole painting\nseems to have been painted at one and the same time, and, as it were,\nfrom the same palette. (1725 [AT: 568], quoted by Louis-Guillaume\nBaillet de Saint-Julien, 1748, Lettre sur la peinture, sculpture\net architecture, Avec un examen des principaux Ouvrages expos\u00e9s\nau Louvre au mois d\u2019Ao\u00fbt, Paris: [n.p.])\n\n\nWhen he translates Du Fresnoy\u2019s De Arte Graphica (1668)\nand publishes his Dialogue upon Coloring (1673), art critic\nRoger de Piles may appear to hold stronger views; however, by\ntransferring emphasis from color to coloring, he too stresses the\nimportance of harmony and the way it presupposes mastery of local\ncolor and chiaroscuro. When de Piles entered the Academy\nthree decades later, he would produce a synthesis under the title\nPrinciples of Painting (1708), in which he insists that\n\n\ntrue painting is such as not only surprises, but as it were, calls to\nus; and has so powerful an effect, that we cannot help coming near it,\nas if it had something to tell us. (1708 [AT: 309])\n\n\nIn a word,\n\n\nthe spectator is not obliged to seek for truth in a painting;\nbut truth, by its effect, must call to the\nspectator, and force his attention. (1708 [AT: 310])\n\n\nThat points to what he called \u201cthe whole together\u201d, that\nis \u201ca general subordination of objects one to another, as makes\nthem all concur to constitute but one\u201d, for the utmost\nsatisfaction of the eye (1708 [AT: 312]). The same lesson can be drawn\nfrom Antoine Coypel\u2019s writings, where \u201cthe excellence of\npainting\u201d is no longer separate from \u201cthe aesthetic of the\npainter\u201d. His nomination as Academy\u2019s Director in 1714 was\nthe sign that a page had been turned.\n\nAfter Louis XIV, patronage of the arts was heavily influenced by the\nstylistic preferences of Louis XV\u2019s official mistress the\nMarquise de Pompadour, who selected the artists and architects who\nwould receive royal pensions, commissioned works that defined the\nlegacy of this era, and sponsored the porcelain works of\nS\u00e8vres. She also introduced her brother, later ennobled as the\nMarquis de Marigny, to the court; she arranged for the painter Antoine\nCoypel and the architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot (later responsible\nfor the Pantheon in Paris) to undertake his education. Wielding her\npolitical influence, she then had Marigny named Director General of\nthe King\u2019s Buildings, which made him an important decision-maker\nin giving royal commissions to artists.\n\nAside from royal patronage, there were also roles for the\n\u201camateurs\u201d or \u201cconnoisseurs\u201d, individuals who\nplayed an increasingly important role in shaping the arts during the\nAncien R\u00e9gime. In the words of art historian Charlotte\nGuichard,\n\n\nThe amateur constituted an intermediate figure between the\npatron, characteristic of court society in early modern times, and the\ncollector, who emerged as the art market developed. (Guichard 2012:\n521)\n\n\nAmong the most famous of these connoisseurs were the financier Pierre\nCrozat and the Comte de Caylus. It was not enough for them to collect\nthousands of works; they were also involved with indexing and\nreproducing them through printmaking. The Recueil Crozat\n(1729 and 1742) is the true ancestor of art books and dictionaries\ndevoted to fine arts, which began to multiply (see, e.g.,\nPern\u00e9ty\u2019s Dictionnaire portatif [1757], Watelet\nand L\u00e9vesque\u2019s Dictionnaire des arts [1792], and\nespecially Mariette\u2019s Abecedario, posthumously\npublished from 1851\u20131860). Catalogs began to proliferate and the\nfirst monographs appeared, among the most important being Recueil\nJulienne, Jean de Julienne\u2019s collection of 271 engravings\nafter Watteau\u2019s paintings. Caylus and Dezallier\nd\u2019Argenville also wrote about artists, sketched biographies and\nestablished rules for discerning the delicacy of style or the\nlightness of execution. All this took place in the larger context in\nwhich the cosmopolitan amateurs of different countries were able to\neasily travel abroad. (Such travels evolved into the ritual of the\nGrand Tour.)\n\nIn an era before formal museums existed, the public had little access\nto art, until the Royal Academy began displaying paintings in what is\nknown as the Salon in 1737. The Salon began as a political and social\nevent that was inaugurated in the Louvre\u2019s Salon Carr\u00e9 on\n25 August\u2014St. Louis\u2019 day\u2014to pay homage to the king\nand it was to last one month. Over the years, it became a valuable\nguide for tracing the major trends in style and aesthetic ideas, for\nlists of works as well as evolutionary trends in pictorial genres were\ntaken into account. But the most significant consequence of the rise\nof the Salon was the birth of a new literary genre, namely, the salon\nreview, which flourished until the twentieth century and has been an\nincomparable mirror of aesthetic thought. Originally, such reviews\nwere just a blend of descriptive reports and theoretical asides, often\ncontroversial. The \u201csalon\u201d is for the benefit of a larger\npublic\u2014that is, those not necessarily affiliated with some\nartistic institution. As La Font de Saint-Yenne wrote in 1747:\n\n\nan exhibited picture is the same as a book on the day of publication,\nand as a play performed in the theater: everyone has the right to make\nhis own judgment. We have gathered together the judgments of the\npublic which showed the greatest amount of agreement and fairness, and\nwe now present them, and not at all our own judgment, to the\nartists, in the belief that this same public [whose] judgments are so\noften bizarre and unjustly damning or hasty rarely errs when all its\nvoices unite on the merit or weakness of any particular work. (1747\n[AT: 555])\n\n\nWith Caylus, Baillet de Saint-Julien, and then above all Diderot, the\naesthetic importance of painting is increasingly emphasized, opening\nthe way to a long tradition of writers keen on painting.\n\nDiderot\u2019s efforts as an art writer were based on two\ncomplementary beliefs, namely, that the techniques used by a painter\nto produce various effects are difficult for the ordinary viewer to\nunderstand and articulate, and that it is a difficult but vital\nchallenge to capture, through literary language, the significant\naspects of a painting. That the painter\u2019s alchemy eludes the\nviewer\u2019s understanding is something often repeated by Diderot,\nnotably with respect to Jean-Baptiste Chardin:\n\n\nIt\u2019s magic, one can\u2019t understand how it\u2019s done:\nthick layers of colour, applied one on top of the other, each one\nfiltering through from underneath to create the effect. At times, it\nlooks as though the canvas has misted over from someone breathing on\nit; at others, as though a thin film of water has landed on\nit\u2026. Close up, everything blurs, goes flat and disappears. From\na distance, everything comes back to life and reappears. (1763 [AT:\n604])\n\n\nAt the same time, Diderot is aware that the painter\u2019s power\nmakes it extremely hard for the writer to give his reader a deep grasp\nof a painting. Despite the difficulty, the writer must somehow express\nthe essence of a masterpiece, thereby achieving a kind of\nekphrasis, in which the art of writing attempts to capture in\nwords the essence and form of the visual art of painting. The critic\nmust not only provide the reader with a short description of the work\nin question, but must attempt to make his words somehow equivalent to\nthe sentiment expressed by the painting in question.\n\nAside from the exceptional painters that Diderot admired, such as\nGreuze and Chardin, the eighteenth century saw a rivalry between two\npredominant styles, rococo and neoclassicism. Rococo artists such as\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher tended to depict scenes of flirtation in rich\ninteriors or pastoral settings, which detractors scorned as\neffeminate. Rococo artists sometimes chose mythological subjects and\nneoclassical painters did as well, but the latter inserted overtly\ndidactic messages. Philosophers such as Diderot praised this latter\nstyle because they claimed it would instill more of a virile sense of\npatriotism among the populace. One could see the works of\nJacques-Louis David, during the Revolution, as the ultimate conflation\nof classical subjects, images of traditionally manly virtue, and\nmessages of national pride. French interest in Antiquity had been\nconstant throughout the Ancien R\u00e9gime, but it was further\nenriched by the dissemination of printed images of archaeological\nsites in Athens, Pompeii, and other cities in which new discoveries\nhad been made.\n\nThe end of the eighteenth century saw the birth of the museum.\nPreviously, people could see works of art only in private homes or in\nreligious institutions, even though during this period, certain\ncollectors began making their \u201ccabinets of curiosities\u201d\navailable to the public. The British Museum had opened in 1759 and the\nUffizi in 1765, but France was behind its neighbors, even if royal\ncollections were more accessible than before. The first suggestion for\ncreating a gallery in the unoccupied Louvre goes back to 1747 and was\nreiterated in 1765 in the eponymous entry in the\nEncyclop\u00e9die (Jaucourt 1765). The Louvre museum\nfinally opened in 1793.\n\nThe new accessibility of art to the masses, as well as the increasing\nliteracy and proliferation of printed works, transformed society in\nthe eighteenth century. The worldly judges of taste in the seventeenth\ncentury gave way to the professional critics, i.e. the Enlightenment\nphilosophes. The new world created by the French Revolution\nwould soon expand\u2014and further complicate\u2014the connection\nbetween the production of art and its reception by both critics and\nthe public.\n",
