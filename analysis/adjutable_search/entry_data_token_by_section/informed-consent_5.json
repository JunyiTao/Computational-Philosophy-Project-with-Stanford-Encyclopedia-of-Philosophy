    "main_text": "Why informed consent? || Trust\n2.4 Trust\n\nIn recent years, a number of philosophers have argued that\n\u201cInformed consent\u2026 is generally important [in part]\nbecause it can make a distinctive contribution to the restoration of\ntrust\u201d (O\u2019Neill 2002, 145; see also Bok 1999, 11,\n26\u20137, 63; Jackson 1994, 491; Kass et al 1996; T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6\n1999, 24). Their trust rationale is future-looking. It points out the\nimportance of ongoing societal trust in caretakers and medical\ninstitutions, for example, as a precondition of ongoing compliance\nwith medical advice, registration for organ donor cards, and\nparticipation in medical research. Since violations of informed\nconsent would jeopardize that trust, they are something to be avoided.\nThis rationale has the advantage of potentially demanding informed\nconsent even to certain low-risk and low-impact interventions. For\nexample, forced testicular exam may be medically \u201csafe\u201d,\nbut, if discovered, could profoundly shake public trust in providers.\nThe rationale also addresses the special wrongness of outright lying\nto patients (perhaps worse than non-lying deceit: Jackson 1991,\n7\u20139)), say, to realize beneficial placebo effects. If\ndiscovered, lying and battery could easily undermine public trust in\nphysicians.\n\nThe trust rationale is most plausible as a partial rationale. It faces\nserious objections if it is taken as a comprehensive justification of\ninformed consent (Eyal 2014). For one thing, being forward-looking,\nthis rationale is vulnerable to the objection that, intuitively,\ninformed consent can remain necessary even when the public could never\nfind out that a core violation of the requirement took place. While\nthe requirement of informed consent might not obtain across the board,\nit seems inappropriate to determine whether it obtains in a given\ncontext based on e.g. how chemically traceable is the medication whose\nforced administration is being considered, although that would affect\nhow much this act would jeopardize future public trust in physicians.\nAnother challenge to this version of the trust rationale is that\ninvasive interventions without a person\u2019s informed consent are\nusually thought to wrong that person, not to wrong only the potential\nfuture victims of a decline in public trust. A possible response would\nbe that the (only) reason why we consider informed consent to be the\nimmediate patient\u2019s right is that what is likeliest to inspire\npublic trust is unconditional commitment to one\u2019s immediate\npatient\u2019s alleged consent rights.\n\nA quite different version of trust rationale is backward-looking. This\nversion defends informed consent as an intrinsically important way to\nhonor the trust that the patient has placed in the physician, and as\npart of the fiduciary role that the physician has undertaken (Joffe\nand Truog 2010, 352ff.), perhaps a matter of virtuous trustworthiness\n(Pellegrino and Thomasma 1993, 65\u201378). However, the\nbackward-looking version of the trust rationale has difficulty\nexplaining the need for informed consent outside pre-existing\ncaretaker-patient relationships. Forced bodily trespass, for example,\nseems (not much less) wrong when it comes from complete strangers.\n",
