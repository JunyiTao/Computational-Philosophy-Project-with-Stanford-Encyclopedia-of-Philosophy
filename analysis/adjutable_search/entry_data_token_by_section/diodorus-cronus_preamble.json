His contributions to logic\u2014in particular, definitions\nof modal terms and the criteria for a sound conditional\u2014are\ncovered in the article on the Dialectical School (see also Section 2\nof the entry on \n  fatalism). The present article\nadds a conspectus of Diodorus\u2019s other ideas. His use of paradox is at\nleast as prominent in our ancient sources about him as are those\nconstructive contributions to logical theory.\n",
