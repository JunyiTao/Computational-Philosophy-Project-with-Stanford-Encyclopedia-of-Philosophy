One\nimportant problem stems from worries about our essence. For\ninstance, I am many things, including an adult, a professor, a driver,\na voter, and so forth. None of these is my essence, however, for I\neither did or could exist without being them. If we could identify my\nessence, however (and generally the essence of individuals like me),\nwe would be able to identify the conditions for my persistence across\ntime as well. Now the Psychological Criterion seems to imply\nthat personhood is my essence, that I couldn't exist without\nbeing a person, and given that personhood is a psychological matter,\npsychological continuity is what preserves my identity. But as Eric\nOlson and others have pointed out, this seems quite wrong (Olson\n1997a, 1997b, DeGrazia 1999a, 1999b, Carter 1982, Snowdon 1990,\nWiggins 1980). After all, just as I was once a teenager, and before\nthat an adolescent and a child, wasn't I also an infant, and\nultimately a fetus? Furthermore, suppose I were in a horrible accident\nand went into a permanent vegetative state (PVS). Wouldn't I\nthen be in a PVS? If so, then if personhood necessarily involves\nhaving a certain sort of developed psychology (e.g., a psychology\ncapable, at the least, of self-reflection), it can't be my essence;\ninstead, being a person would be like being a child, or a teenager,\nsomething one becomes and may also outlive (called a \u201cphase\nsortal\u201d in the literature).\n\n\nIf personhood isn't my essence, then what is? The most \nplausible answer seems to be that I am a biological organism, a human animal. \nAnd if this is my essence, it will also provide the conditions of my \npersistence across time. From this move, then, we get the \nBiological Criterion of Personal Identity: if X is \na person at t1, and Y exists at any \nother time, then X=Y if and only if Y's \nbiological organism is continuous with X's biological \norganism (Olson 1997b, DeGrazia 2005). Note that Y may or \nmay not be a person, which allows that X might be one and \nthe same as a fetus or someone in a PVS. This view is also sometimes \ncalled animalism (e.g., Noonan 1998, Olson 2003, Blatti and Snowdon 2016).\n\n\nConsider, then, this criterion of our identity. While it obviously\ndoes well with the essence question, it seems to do less well when we\nconsider its relation to ethics. Again, what seems to ground the\nrationality of my anticipation of future experiences is the fact that\nthat future person will be the inheritor of my psychology. That he's\nalso the inheritor of my biological organism seems irrelevant. Indeed,\nour reactions to certain thought experiments strongly suggest that we\nthink rational anticipation, self-concern, moral responsibility, and\nthe like can be justified even in the absence of biological\ncontinuity. We can see this most dramatically in considering\nthe transplant intuition (Olson 1997b, 43\u201351, DeGrazia\n2005, 51\u201354). Suppose my cerebrum were transplanted into a\ndifferent living body and the resulting person turned out be exactly\nlike me psychologically.  Suppose also that my cerebrum-less organism\nwere kept alive. What would have happened to me? Most people share the\nintuition that the recipient of my cerebrum would be me, simply\nbecause he would have my psychology and survival of my psychology\nseems to be what matters in my survival. The advocate of the\nBiological Criterion, however, has to maintain that I remain the\ncerebrum-less donor, essentially in a PVS, while the other person\n\u2013 the person who seems to remember my experiences, and seems to\nbe carrying out my intentions, and seems just like me psychologically\nin every respect \u2013 is just a deluded imposter. But this is hard\nto believe. Suppose further that I had committed some crime and then\ndonated my cerebrum in this way.  The person who woke up would seem to\nremember my crime and anticipate enjoying getting away with it for a\nwhile, but if identity is what's necessary for responsibility, he\ncould not be responsible for my actions, on the Biological Criterion,\nand so he wouldn't deserve blame or punishment for the crime. Again,\nthis seems hard to believe.  What accounts for the practical concerns\nwe have seems to be grounded in psychological relations, and the\nBiological Criterion thus targets a relation for identity that is just\nirrelevant for those concerns (a key exception will be discussed\nlater, however).\n\n\nThere are a couple of replies here. DeGrazia, for one, admits that \nthe transplant intuition is a thorn in the side of the Biological \nCriterion (DeGrazia 2005, 54). But when it comes to that criterion's \nseemingly poor fit with our practical concerns generally, he suggests\nthat, \u201cin the world as we know it,\u201d there's much less of \na problem than we might think (DeGrazia 2005, 60\u201361). After all, in \nnearly all everyday cases, a necessary condition for the \npsychological continuity grounding our practical concerns is \nbiological continuity. So if the grounding for our practical concerns\nrequires psychological continuity, but psychological continuity \n(ordinarily) presupposes biological continuity, then the grounding \nfor our practical concerns (ordinarily) requires biological \ncontinuity as well.\n\n\nThis reply, however, seems to overlook the original motivation, \nwhich was to find a somewhat closer relation between identity and our\npractical concerns than this. While biological continuity may \ntrack the patterns of ethical concerns, it doesn't provide any real \nexplanation for them. It may be rational for me to \nanticipate only the experiences of my biological continuers, for \ninstance, but it won't be in virtue of my biological \ncontinuity with them that it's rational to do so; rather, it seems \nrational only in virtue of the psychological relations they are \nexpected to bear to me. And so one might be tempted to reject the \nBiological Criterion of identity because of this poor explanatory fit\nwith our practical concerns.\n\n\nNevertheless, there is another reply available for the advocate of the\nBiological Criterion, namely, to deny that personal identity has this\npurported fit with our practical concerns at all. Instead, while\nbiological continuity preserves our identity across time (this\nadvocate might say), psychological continuity is the relation\ngrounding our practical concerns. This move would still preserve the\nthought that identity has an impact for ethics, just not the one we\nthought. As Olson, puts it, if it's right that \u201cthe relations of\npractical concerns that typically go along with our identity through\ntime are closely connected with psychological continuity \u2026,\nthen the Biological Approach does have an interesting ethical\nconsequence, namely that those practical relations are not necessarily\nconnected with numerical identity\u201d (Olson 1997b, 70). Obviously,\nthis would be very surprising for theorists like Butler, Reid, and\neven Locke to hear, but if we had overwhelming metaphysical reasons to\nadopt the Biological Criterion, it could well be true. This stance is\na version of the Identity Doesn't Matter (IDM) view, to be discussed\nlater.\n",
