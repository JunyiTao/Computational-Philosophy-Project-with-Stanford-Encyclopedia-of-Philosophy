    "main_text": "\n\nMontague semantics is a theory of natural language semantics and of\nits relation with syntax. It was originally developed by the logician\nRichard Montague (1930\u20131971) and subsequently modified and\nextended by linguists, philosophers, and logicians. The most important\nfeatures of the theory are its use of model theoretic semantics which\nis nowadays commonly used for the semantics of logical languages and\nits adherence to the principle of compositionality\u2014that is, the\nmeaning of the whole is a function of the meanings of its parts and\ntheir mode of syntactic combination. This entry presents the origins\nof Montague Semantics, summarizes important aspects of the classical\ntheory, and sketches more recent developments. We conclude with a\nsmall example, which illustrates some modern features.\n",
