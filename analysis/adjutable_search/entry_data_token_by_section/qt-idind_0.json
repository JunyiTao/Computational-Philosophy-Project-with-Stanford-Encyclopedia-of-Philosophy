Introduction\n\n\nIt is typically held that chairs, trees, rocks, people and many of the\nso-called \u2018everyday\u2019 objects we encounter can be regarded\nas individuals. The issue, then, is how this individuality is to be\nunderstood, or what constitutes the \u2018principle\u2019 of\nindividuality. This is an issue which has a very long history in\nphilosophy. A number of approaches to it can be broadly delineated. \n\n\nWe might begin by noting that a tree and rock, say, can be\ndistinguished in terms of their different properties. We might\nthen go further and insist that this also forms the basis for ascribing\nindividuality to them. Even two apparently very similar\nobjects, such as two coins of the same denomination or so-called\nidentical twins, will display some differences in their\nproperties \u2013 a scratch here, a scar there, and so on. On this\naccount such differences are sufficient to both distinguish and\nindividuate the objects. This undergirds the so-called\n\u2018bundle\u2019 view of objects, according to which an object\nis nothing but a bundle of properties. In order to guarantee\nindividuation, no two objects can then be absolutely\nindistinguishable, or indiscernible, in the sense of\npossessing exactly the same set of properties. This last\nclaim has been expressed as the Principle of Identity of\nIndiscernibles and it ensures the individuality of the objects that\nfall under its scope; we shall return to it below.\n\n\nHowever, this approach has been criticised on the grounds (among\nothers) that we can surely conceive of two absolutely\nindistinguishable objects: thinking of Star Trek, we could imagine a\nreplicator device which precisely reproduces an object, such as a coin\nor even a person, giving two such objects exactly the same set of\nproperties. Not quite, one might respond, since these two objects do\nnot and indeed cannot exist at the same place at the same time; that\nis, they do not possess the same spatio-temporal properties. In terms\nof these properties, then, the objects can still be\ndistinguished and hence regarded as different individuals. Clearly,\nthen, this approach to the issue of individuality must be underpinned\nby the assumption that individual objects are\nimpenetrable.\n\n\nA more thorough-going criticism of this property based approach to\nindividuality insists that it conflates epistemological issues\nconcerning how we distinguish objects, with ontological issues\nconcerning the metaphysical basis of individuality. Thus, it is argued,\nto talk of distinguishability requires at least two objects but we can\nimagine a universe in which there exists only one. In such a situation,\nit is claimed, it would be inappropriate to say that the object is\ndistinguishable but not that it is an individual. Although we do not\nactually find ourselves in such situations, of course, still, it is\ninsisted, distinguishability and individuality should be kept\nconceptually distinct.\n\n\nIf this line of argument is accepted, then the principle of\nindividuality must be sought in something over and above the properties\nof an object. One candidate is the notion of substance, in which\nproperties are taken to inhere in some way. Locke famously described\nsubstance as a \u2018something, we know not what\u2019, since to\ndescribe it we would have to talk of its properties, but bare substance,\nby its very nature, has no properties itself.\n\n\nAlternatively, the individuality of an object has been expressed in\nterms of its \u2018haecceity\u2019 or \u2018primitive\nthisness\u2019 (Adams 1979). As the name suggests, this is taken to\nbe the primitive basis of individuality, which cannot be analysed\nfurther.  However, it has also been identified with the notion of\nself-identity, understood as a relational property (Adams\nibid.) and expressed more formally as\n\u2018a=a\u2019. Each individual is understood to\nbe identical to itself. This may seem like a form of the\nproperty-based approach we started with, but self-identity is a rather\npeculiar kind of property. As we\u2019ll see, denying that quantum objects\nare self-identical may be one way of capturing the idea that they are\nnon-individuals. \n\n\nThis is just a sketch of some of the various positions that have\nbeen adopted. There has been considerable debate over which of them\napplies to the everyday objects mentioned above. But at least it is\ngenerally agreed that such objects should be regarded as individuals to\nbegin with. What about the fundamental objects posited by current\nphysical theories, such as electrons, protons, neutrons etc.? Can these\nbe regarded as individuals? One response is that they cannot, since\nthey behave very differently in aggregates from \u2018classical\u2019\nindividuals.\n",
