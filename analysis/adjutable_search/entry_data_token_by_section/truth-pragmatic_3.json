    "main_text": "History of the Pragmatic Theory of Truth || Dewey\u2019s Pragmatic Theory of Truth\n1.3 Dewey\u2019s Pragmatic Theory of Truth\n\nJohn Dewey (1859\u20131952), the third figure from the golden era of\nclassical American pragmatism, had surprisingly little to say about\nthe concept of truth especially given his voluminous writings on other\ntopics. On an anecdotal level, as many have observed, the index to his\n527 page Logic: The Theory of Inquiry (1938 [2008]) has only\none reference to \u201ctruth\u201d, and that to a footnote\nmentioning Peirce. Otherwise the reader is advised to \u201cSee\nalso assertibility\u201d.\n\nAt first glance, Dewey\u2019s account of truth looks like a\ncombination of Peirce and James. Like Peirce, Dewey emphasizes the\nconnection between truth and rigorous scientific inquiry; like James,\nDewey views truth as the verified result of past inquiry rather than\nas the anticipated result of inquiry proceeding into an indefinite\nfuture. For example, in 1911 he writes that:\n\n\nFrom the standpoint of scientific inquiry, truth indicates not just\naccepted beliefs, but beliefs accepted in virtue of a certain\nmethod.\u2026To science, truth denotes verified beliefs,\npropositions that have emerged from a certain procedure of inquiry and\ntesting. By that I mean that if a scientific man were asked to point\nto samples of what he meant by truth, he would pick\u2026beliefs\nwhich were the outcome of the best technique of inquiry available in\nsome particular field; and he would do this no matter what his\nconception of the Nature of Truth. (1911 [2008: 28])\n\n\nFurthermore, like both Peirce and James, Dewey charges correspondence\ntheories of truth with being unnecessarily obscure because these\ntheories depend on an abstract (and unverifiable) relationship between\na proposition and how things \u201creally are\u201d (1911 [2008:\n34]). Finally, Dewey also offers a pragmatic reinterpretation of the\ncorrespondence theory that operationalizes the idea of\ncorrespondence:\n\n\nOur definition of truth\u2026uses correspondence as a mark of a\nmeaning or proposition in exactly the same sense in which it is used\neverywhere else\u2026as the parts of a machine correspond. (1911\n[2008: 45])\n\n\nDewey has an expansive understanding of \u201cscience\u201d. For\nDewey, science emerges from and is continuous with everyday processes\nof trial and error\u2014cooking and small-engine repair count as\n\u201cscientific\u201d on his account\u2014which means he should\nnot be taken too strictly when he equates truth with scientific\nverification. (Peirce and James also had expansive understandings of\nscience.) Rather, Dewey\u2019s point is that true propositions, when\nacted on, lead to the sort of predictable and dependable outcomes that\nare hallmarks of scientific verification, broadly construed. From a\npragmatic standpoint, scientific verification boils down to the\nprocess of matching up expectations with outcomes, a process that\ngives us all the \u201ccorrespondence\u201d we could ask for.\n\nDewey eventually came to believe that conventional philosophical terms\nsuch as \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d were burdened\nwith so much baggage, and had become so fossilized, that it was\ndifficult to grasp the practical role these terms had originally\nserved. As a result, in his later writings Dewey largely avoids\nspeaking of \u201ctruth\u201d or \u201cknowledge\u201d while\nfocusing instead on the functions played by these concepts. By his\n1938 Logic: The Theory of Inquiry Dewey was speaking of\n\u201cwarranted assertibility\u201d as the goal of inquiry, using\nthis term in place of both \u201ctruth\u201d and\n\u201cknowledge\u201d (1938 [2008: 15\u201316]). In 1941, in a\nresponse to Russell entitled \u201cPropositions, Warranted\nAssertibility, and Truth\u201d, he wrote that \u201cwarranted\nassertibility\u201d is a \u201cdefinition of the nature of knowledge\nin the honorific sense according to which only true beliefs are\nknowledge\u201d (1941: 169). Here Dewey suggests that\n\u201cwarranted assertibility\u201d is a better way of capturing the\nfunction of both knowledge and truth insofar as both are goals of\ninquiry. His point is that it makes little difference, pragmatically,\nwhether we describe the goal of inquiry as \u201cacquiring more\nknowledge\u201d, \u201cacquiring more truth\u201d, or better yet,\n\u201cmaking more warrantably assertible judgments\u201d.\n\nBecause it focuses on truth\u2019s function as a goal of inquiry,\nDewey\u2019s pragmatic account of truth has some unconventional\nfeatures. To begin with, Dewey reserves the term \u201ctrue\u201d\nonly for claims that are the product of controlled inquiry. This means\nthat claims are neither true nor false before they are tested but\nthat, rather, it is the process of verification that makes them\ntrue:\n\n\ntruth and falsity are properties only of that subject-matter which is\nthe end, the close, of the inquiry by means of which it is\nreached. (1941: 176)\n\n\nSecond, Dewey insists that only \u201cjudgments\u201d\u2014not\n\u201cpropositions\u201d\u2014are properly viewed as truth-bearers.\nFor Dewey, \u201cpropositions\u201d are the proposals and working\nhypotheses that are used, via a process of inquiry, to generate\nconclusions and verified judgments. As such, propositions may be more\nor less relevant to the inquiry at hand but they are not, strictly\nspeaking true or false (1941: 176). Rather, truth and falsity are\nreserved for \u201cjudgments\u201d or \u201cthe settled outcome of\ninquiry\u201d (1941: 175; 1938 [2008: 124]; Burke 1994): reserved for\nclaims, in other words, that are warrantedly assertible. Third, Dewey\ncontinues to argue that this pragmatic approach to truth is \u201cthe\nonly one entitled to be called a correspondence theory of truth\u201d\n(1941: 179) using terms nearly identical to those he used in 1911:\n\n\nMy own view takes correspondence in the operational sense\u2026of\nanswering, as a key answers to conditions imposed by a lock,\nor as two correspondents \u201canswer\u201d each other; or, in\ngeneral, as a reply is an adequate answer to a question or\ncriticism\u2014; as, in short, a solution answers the\nrequirements of a problem. (1941: 178)\n\n\nThanks to Russell (e.g., 1941: Ch. XXIII) and others, by 1941 Dewey\nwas aware of the problems facing pragmatic accounts of truth. In\nresponse, we see him turning to the language of \u201cwarranted\nassertibility\u201d, drawing a distinction between\n\u201cpropositions\u201d and \u201cjudgments\u201d, and grounding\nthe concept of truth (or warranted assertibility) in scientific\ninquiry (Thayer 1947; Burke 1994). These adjustments were designed to\nextend, clarify, and improve on Peirce\u2019s and James\u2019\naccounts. Whether they did so is an open question. Certainly many,\nsuch as Quine, concluded that Dewey was only sidestepping important\nquestions about truth: that Dewey\u2019s strategy was \u201csimply\nto avoid the truth predicate and limp along with warranted\nbelief\u201d (Quine 2008: 165).\n\nPeirce, James, and Dewey were not the only ones to propose or defend a\npragmatic theory of truth in the nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies. Others, such as F.C.S. Schiller (1864\u20131937), also put\nforward pragmatic theories (though Schiller\u2019s view, which he\ncalled \u201chumanism\u201d, also attracted more than its share of\ncritics, arguably for very good reasons). Pragmatic theories of truth\nalso received the attention of prominent critics, including Russell\n(1909, 1910 [1994]), Moore (1908), and Lovejoy (1908a,b) among others.\nSeveral of these criticisms will be considered later; suffice it to\nsay that pragmatic theories of truth soon came under pressure that led\nto revisions and several successor approaches over the next\nhundred-plus years.\n\nHistorically Peirce, James, and Dewey had the greatest influence in\nsetting the parameters for what makes a theory of truth\npragmatic\u2014this despite the sometimes significant differences\nbetween their respective accounts, and that over time they modified\nand clarified their positions in response to both criticism and\nover-enthusiastic praise. While this can make it difficult to pin down\na single definition of what, historically, counted as a pragmatic\ntheory of truth, there are some common themes that cut across each of\ntheir accounts. First, each account begins from a pragmatic analysis\nof the meaning of the truth predicate. On the assumption that\ndescribing a belief, claim, or judgment as \u201ctrue\u201d must\nmake some kind of practical difference, each of these accounts\nattempts to describe what this difference is. Second, each account\nthen connects truth specifically to processes of inquiry: to describe\na claim as true is to say that it either has or will stand up to\nscrutiny. Third, each account rejects correspondence theories of truth\nas overly abstract, \u201ctranscendental\u201d, or metaphysical. Or,\nmore accurately, each attempts to redefine correspondence in pragmatic\nterms, as the agreement between a claim and a predicted outcome. While\nthe exact accounts offered by Peirce, James, and Dewey found few\ndefenders\u2014by the mid-twentieth century pragmatic theories of\ntruth were largely dormant\u2014these themes did set a trajectory for\nfuture versions of the pragmatic theory of truth.\n",
