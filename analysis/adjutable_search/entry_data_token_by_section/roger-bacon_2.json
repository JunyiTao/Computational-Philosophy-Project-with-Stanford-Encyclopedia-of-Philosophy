    "main_text": "Bacon\u2019s early work on Grammar and Logic\n3. Bacon\u2019s early work on Grammar and Logic\n\nBacon has a complex notion of grammar. It ranges from the elementary\nteaching of Latin through \u201crational grammar\u201d (linguistics)\nto a knowledge of the sacred \u201cWisdom\u201d languages. It is\nalso connected with a theory of signs and with the vis\nverborum, including the magical power of spoken language. One\nnotices continuity between Bacon\u2019s early works on grammar and\nlogic and his later works after 1260 on the theory of signs (De\nsignis).\n",
