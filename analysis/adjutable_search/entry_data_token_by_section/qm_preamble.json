    "main_text": "\n\n\nQuantum mechanics is, at least at first glance and at least in part, a\nmathematical machine for predicting the behaviors of microscopic\nparticles \u2014 or, at least, of the measuring instruments we use to\nexplore those behaviors \u2014 and in that capacity, it is spectacularly\nsuccessful: in terms of power and precision, head and shoulders above\nany theory we have ever had. Mathematically, the theory is well\nunderstood; we know what its parts are, how they are put together, and\nwhy, in the mechanical sense (i.e., in a sense that can be answered by\ndescribing the internal grinding of gear against gear), the whole thing\nperforms the way it does, how the information that gets fed in at one\nend is converted into what comes out the other. The question of what\nkind of a world it describes, however, is controversial; there is very\nlittle agreement, among physicists and among philosophers, about what\nthe world is like according to quantum mechanics. Minimally\ninterpreted, the theory describes a set of facts about the way the\nmicroscopic world impinges on the macroscopic one, how it affects our\nmeasuring instruments, described in everyday language or the language\nof classical mechanics. Disagreement centers on the question of what a\nmicroscopic world, which affects our apparatuses in the prescribed\nmanner, is, or even could be, like intrinsically; or how those\napparatuses could themselves be built out of microscopic parts of the\nsort the theory\n describes.[1]\n\n\n\nThat is what an interpretation of the theory would provide: a proper\naccount of what the world is like according to quantum mechanics,\nintrinsically and from the bottom up. The problems with giving an\ninterpretation (not just a comforting, homey sort of interpretation,\ni.e., not just an interpretation according to which the world isn\u2019t too\ndifferent from the familiar world of common sense, but any\ninterpretation at all) are dealt with in other sections of this\nencyclopedia. Here, we are concerned only with the mathematical heart\nof the theory, the theory in its capacity as a mathematical machine,\nand \u2014 whatever is true of the rest of it \u2014 this part of the\ntheory makes exquisitely good sense.\n",
