    "main_text": "Pragmatist Epistemology || Skepticism versus Fallibilism\n4.1 Skepticism versus Fallibilism\n\nThe roots of pragmatism\u2019s anti-skepticism can be found in\nPeirce\u2019s early (1868) paper \u2018Some Consequences of Four\nIncapacities\u2019 (EP1: 28\u201330). Here he identifies\n\u2018Cartesianism\u2019 as a philosophical pathology that lost\nsight of certain insights that were fundamental to scholastic thought\n(for all its faults), and \u2013 he argued \u2013 more suited to the\nphilosophical needs of his own time. The paper begins by identifying\nfour problematic teachings of modern philosophy:\n\nOne can and should try to doubt all of one\u2019s beliefs at\nonce.\nThe ultimate test of certainty lies in individual\nconsciousness.\nThe \u2018multiform argumentation\u2019 characteristic of the\nMiddle Ages is replaced by a single chain of inference.\nWhere scholasticism consciously limited its explanatory capacity\n(purporting to explain only \u2018all created things\u2019),\nCartesianism\u2019s stated ambition to explain everything ironically\nrenders its own presuppositions hidden, mysterious and philosophically\ndangerous. \n\n\nThe first, and in many ways most important of these Cartesian\nteachings was the method of universal doubt. We should retain beliefs\nonly if they are absolutely certain and we are unable to doubt them.\nThe test of this certainty, as Peirce next points out, lies in whether\nthe individual consciousness is satisfied. Importantly, this\nself-examination includes reflection on hypothetical possibilities: we\ncannot trust our perceptual beliefs, for example, because we cannot\nrule out that they might be produced by a dream, or an evil demon.\n(See Hookway 2012, chapters 2,3.) The initial pragmatist response to\nthis is that it is a strategy that in practice we cannot carry out\neffectively, and there is no reason to adopt it anyway. Peirce claims\nthat any attempt to adopt the method of doubt will be an exercise in\nself-deception because we possess a variety of certainties which it\ndoes not occur to us can be questioned. So what is produced\nwill not be \u2018real doubt\u2019; these beliefs will lurk in the\nbackground, influencing our reflection. Peirce urges us not to\n\u2018pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our\nhearts\u2019 (EP1: 29). \n\nIt is necessary to separate some different threads in his argument\nhere. First, there is something unnatural about the Cartesian\nstrategy. Inquiries normally occur within a context: we address\nparticular questions or problems, relying on background certainties\nthat it does not occur to us to doubt. The Cartesian suggestion that\nwe should begin by trying to doubt everything appears to be an attempt\nto step outside of this. Second, the Cartesian strategy requires us to\nreflect upon each of our beliefs and ask what reason we have for\nholding it; skeptical challenges are then used to question the\nadequacy of these reasons. This is again at odds with normal practice.\nMany of our familiar certainties are such that we cannot offer any\nconcrete or convincing reason for believing them. We tend to treat our\nestablished beliefs as innocent until \u2018proven guilty\u2019. The\nmere lack of a conclusive reason for belief does not itself provide us\nwith a reason for doubt.\n\nDescartes, of course, might have conceded this, but responded that the\nrevision is required because once we allow error to enter our\nbelief-corpus we may be unable to escape from its damaging effects.\nHis was a time of methodological ferment, and he appreciated how many\nfalse beliefs he himself had acquired from his teachers. The\npragmatist response here is to question some of Descartes\u2019\nassumptions about how we reason and form beliefs. First, his strategy\nis individualist and \u2018to make single individuals absolute judges\nof truth is most pernicious\u2019. Peirce noted that the natural\nsciences which were so conspicuously successful in Descartes\u2019\nday took a very different approach:\n\nIn sciences in which men come to agreement, when a theory has been\nbroached, it is considered to be on probation until this agreement has\nbeen reached. After it is reached, the question of certainty becomes\nan idle one, because there is no one left who doubts it. We\nindividually cannot reasonably hope to attain the ultimate philosophy\nwhich we pursue; we can only seek it, therefore, for the\ncommunity of philosophers. (EP1: 29)\n\n\nPeirce also questions Descartes\u2019 understanding of reasoning in\nholding that we may rely on \u2018a single thread of inference\u2019\nthat is no stronger than its weakest link:\n\nPhilosophy ought to imitate the successful sciences in its methods, so\nfar as to\u2026trust rather to the multitude and variety of its\narguments than to the conclusiveness of any one. Its reasoning should\nnot form a chain which is no stronger than its weakest link, but a\ncable whose fibres may be ever so slender, provided they are\nsufficiently numerous and intimately connected. (EP1: 29)\n\n\nWhere the Cartesian holds that unless we begin from premises of which\nwe can be absolutely certain we may never reach the truth, the\npragmatist emphasises that, when we do go wrong, further discussion\nand investigation can identify and eliminate errors, which is our best\nhope for escaping their damaging effects. The possibility of error\nprovides us with reason to be \u2018contrite fallibilists\u2019,\nrather than skeptics. The focus of epistemological inquiry should not\nbe on showing how we can possess absolute certainty, but on how\nwe can develop self-correcting methods of inquiry that make\nfallible progress.\n\nWilliam James makes similar observations. In \u2018The Will to\nBelieve\u2019, he reminds us that we have two cognitive desiderata:\nto obtain truth, and to avoid error (James 1897: 30). The harder we\ntry to avoid error, the more likely it is that we will miss out on\ntruth; and the more strenuously we search for truth, the more likely\nwe are to let in error. The method of doubt may make sense in\nspecial cases where enormous weight is given to avoiding error, even\nif that means loss of truth, but only there. Once we recognize that we\nare making a practical and forced decision about the relative\nimportance of two goods, the Cartesian strategy no longer\nappears the only rational one. Later, Dewey in The Quest for\nCertainty similarly urged that a focus on eliminating all error\nfrom our beliefs is both doomed and destructive, with the added twist\nof a social diagnosis of the quest itself: the uncertainty, pain and\nfear of much early human life led to the erection of\n\u2018priestly\u2019 forms of knowledge which in promising to\nintercede with a Heavenly stability, sundered a priori theory\nfrom a posteriori practice, thereby enabling the knowing\nclasses to insulate themselves from a more humble (and realistic)\nempiricism. The \u2018quest\u2019 continues, however, in many\ndebates in contemporary mainstream epistemology.\n",
