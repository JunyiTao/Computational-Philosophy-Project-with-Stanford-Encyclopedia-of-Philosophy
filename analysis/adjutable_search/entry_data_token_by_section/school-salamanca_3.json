    "main_text": "Theology and Church Law\n4. Theology and Church Law\n\nA common theological topic for the authors of the School of Salamanca\nwas the need to resist what they considered to be Lutheran heresies\n(Skinner 1978: 135\u2013173). They suspected, for instance, that\nconnecting legal authority to the virtue of princes could\n\u201cinveigle away the hearts of simple men from due obedience to\ntheir princes and their priests\u201d, as Vitoria put it (De\npotestate ecclesiastica I qu. 1, art. 2; transl. Vitoria 1991b:\n55); and they regarded as heretical the view that grace is not\nincreased directly by the sacraments ex opere operato but\nrequires the faith of the recipient (Vitoria, De potestate\necclesiastica I qu. 2, art. 2). Other points at issue were\nwhether all Christians could be seen as priests (ibid., II qu. 2, art.\n1), the role of papacy, the veneration of the Virgin Mary and the\ncentral problem of free will, which was denied by Luther. As we shall\nsee, the problem of free will and grace also gave rise to an extremely\nbitter and long-lasting controversy between Dominicans and Jesuits\ninside Catholicism after the Council of Trent, which had avoided the\nissue except to reject Protestant theologies.\n\nVitoria\u2019s awareness of the challenge of Luther to Catholicism\naffected his teaching and that of his successors. In his\nRelectiones de potestate ecclesiastica (1532\u20131533) and\nRelectio de potestate papae et concilii (1534), he was\ncritical of the Roman curia, especially on account of its free-handed\ndistribution of dispensations; but he was careful not to open the way\nfor any assault on the papacy and Catholic orthodoxy.\n\nVitoria\u2019s basic ecclesiology was traditional, identifying the\necclesia as the \u201ccongregation of the faithful\u201d.\nWhen heretics left this community, they did so like deserters from an\narmy. The Church received its power from Christ, which was distinct\nfrom that of lay regimes, in order to promote good and resist evil.\nThe priesthood of the New Law superseded that of the Old Law. The\nChurch\u2019s power had two aspects: orders and jurisdiction. Orders\ninvolved the sacraments, especially the eucharist and penance.\nJurisdiction included spiritual censures inflicted on erring\nbelievers. By divine command, the Church was a \u201cperfect\u201d\ncommunity, that is, one which was able to defend itself and punish\niniquity.\n\nChrist established the papacy to look after the Church\u2019s\nwelfare. Priests administered the sacraments under the supervision of\nthe pope and the bishops. Orders came via the apostles but\njurisdiction via Peter, Christ\u2019s vicar. It was the\nresponsibility of his successors, the popes, to build up the Church.\nBishops legislated for their diocese or province, but the pope acted\nfor the whole Church. Vitoria expressed great respect for general\ncouncils as gatherings of bishops, but he maintained that a council\ndid not have power superior to that of the pope. Moreover, after\nconsidering the councils of the fifteenth century, which had resolved\nthe Great Western Schism (1378\u20131417), he denied conciliarism in\nits dogmatic form. The most ancient councils had not claimed that\nsupreme power was invested in the Church (Izbicki 2019).\n\nSpiritual power was superior to temporal, but that did not make the\npope lord of the world. Papal power could have an impact on Christian\nregimes, making and unmaking rulers, but only for spiritual ends. The\npontiff could authorize just wars against the Saracens and other\nenemies of the faith. The ecclesiastical commonwealth had its powers\nfrom grace, but grace did not cancel nature. To the contrary:\nAccording to Aquinas \u201cgrace presupposes nature and perfects\nit\u201d (Gratia praesupponit naturam et perficit eam, ST I\nqu. I art. 8 ad 2).\n\nThe topic of grace and free will was the main ingredient of the\ncontroversy over Molinism. It began with the work of Molina mentioned\nabove, Liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina praescientia,\nprovidentia, praedestinatione et reprobatione concordia (Molina\nConcordia). In it he explains how God can preserve his\nomnipotence, providence and pre-knowledge, while conceding free will\nto humans, by means of his scientia media, or \u201cmiddle\nknowledge\u201d, which gives him the ability to know what human\nbeings will decide\u2014but no control over their decisions.\nScientia media is placed between scientia naturalis,\nby which God knows everything that can be, and scientia\nlibera, by which he knows what will be. Molina places God\u2019s\ncounterfactual knowledge before the creation\u2014contrary to Luther\nand Calvin. God\u2019s omnipotence consists in the possibility that\nhe could have created beings without the capacity to accept or reject\nthe offer of grace by their will (Concordia pars IV, disp.\n52). Furthermore, humans are able by their free will, without the\nspecial help of God (sine auxilio speciali Dei;\nConcordia pars I, disp. 5 [1953: 29]), but only with his\nconcursus generale, to act morally in a temporal sense.\nHowever, they need grace within temporal life and God\u2019s special\nhelp for the effort to receive eternal grace, i.e., the visio\nbeatifica, the vision of God of the blessed after their death. In\nthe ensuing controversy, known as De auxiliis, fierce\ncriticisms came from the Dominican Domingo Ba\u00f1ez, who had the\nfirst chair of theology at Salamanca, and his pupils; they held a\nspecial Thomist theory of grace, which referred to the\npraedeterminatio physica, mankind\u2019s inability to resist\nGod\u2019s grace.\n\nIt is easy to forget that Su\u00e1rez was concerned not only with\nmetaphysics and law; but he has also been described as the founder of\nMariology on account of his treatment of the Immaculate Conception and\nMary\u2019s bodily assumption. Su\u00e1rez took a balanced view of\nthe issues of divine foreknowledge, free will and predestination in\nthe De auxiliis controversy; and, building on Molina, he\ndeveloped the doctrine of Congruism, which argued that God had\narranged matters to allow free will to assent to grace. He also\ndiscussed how God rewards the good and punishes sinners.\n\nSu\u00e1rez was a confirmed papalist, who regarded the Holy See as\nnecessary to the Church\u2019s unity. Canon law existed as a distinct\naspect of human law, supporting humanity\u2019s higher ends and\nunifying all peoples. The pope was divinely guided in pronouncements\non doctrine, and he had a universal responsibility to spread the\ngospel. Su\u00e1rez, however, refused to accept evangelization as an\nexcuse for war. Not even unnatural acts justified the use of violence.\nConsequently, Su\u00e1rez, like Vitoria and Soto, upheld the\nlegitimacy of non-Christian regimes operating within the bounds of\nnatural law.\n",
