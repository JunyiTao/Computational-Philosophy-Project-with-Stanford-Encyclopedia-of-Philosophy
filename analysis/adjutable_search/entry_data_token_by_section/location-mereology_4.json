    "main_text": "Interpenetration\n4. Interpenetration\n\nIn this section we consider arguments for and against the following\nprinciple:\n\nNo Interpenetration\n\u25a1\u2200x\u2200y\u2200z\u2200w[(L(x,\nz) & L(y, w) & O(z,\nw)) \u2192 O(x, y)]\n\nNecessarily, if x and y have exact locations that\noverlap, then x and y themselves overlap.\n\n\nAccording to No Interpenetration, it is metaphysically impossible for\nentities of any type to \u2018pass through one another\u2019 without\nsharing parts\u2014in the manner of a ghost passing through a solid\nbrick wall. There is a related principle that deserves some comment.\nThe related principle says that, necessarily, if x's exact\nlocation is a part of y's exact location, then x is a\npart of y. In symbols:\n\n(1)\n\n\u25a1\u2200x\u2200y\u2200z\u2200w[(L(x,\nz) & L(y, w) & P(z,\nw)) \u2192 P(x, y)]\n\n\nThis principle may seem to say basically the same thing as No\nInterpenetration but to say it more simply\u2014using the primitive\npredicate \u2018P\u2019 instead of the defined predicate\n\u2018O\u2019. Why then focus on No Interpenetration instead\nof (1)?\n\nThe reason for this is that some of the opposition to (1) will stem\nfrom opposition to a purely mereological principle: Strong\nSupplementation. It says that if every part of x overlaps\ny, then x is a part of y. Those who deny this\nwill be very likely to deny (1), but they might still be attracted to\nNo Interpenetration. Let Lump1 be a lump of clay, and let Goliath be\nthe statue that is \u2018made out of\u2019 Lump1. One might think\nthat every part of Goliath overlaps Lump1 (and vice versa), and that\nGoliath's exact location is a part of (indeed, identical to) Lump1's\nexact location, but that Goliath is not a part of Lump1 (Lowe 2003).\nIn that case one will reject (1). But one might still go on to say\nthat \u2018ghostly-interpenetration-without-part-sharing\u2019 is\nimpossible, and hence that No Interpenetration is true. After all,\nGoliath and Lump1 share parts, as do Goliath's top two-thirds and\nLump1's bottom two-thirds, and so on.\n\nIn general, our task here is to set aside the purely mereological\ncontroversies (see the entry on\n mereology)\n and to focus instead on the issues that are exclusively concerned\nwith location and its interaction with parthood. Too much of the\ncontroversy over (1) arises from controversy over \u2018pure\nmereology\u2019. By contrast, if No Interpenetration is\ncontroversial, this is only because of what it says about the\nconnections between parthood and location.\n",
