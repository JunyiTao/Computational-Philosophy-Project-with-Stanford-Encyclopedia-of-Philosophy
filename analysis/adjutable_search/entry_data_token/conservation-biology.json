In this\nentry, we explore questions regarding the ontology, theoretical\nstructure, and values central to conservation biology. First,\nconservation biology as a discipline has expended a great deal of\nintellectual effort in articulating exactly what is its object of\nstudy and has settled on biodiversity as the answer. However, there is\na debate concerning what biodiversity is, and whether it should be\ncenter stage in the discipline. Second, conservation biology, though a\nscientific discipline with its theories, models, experiments, and\nfieldwork, also utilizes a variety of tools that do not fit into the\nabove categories. That is, some of its core tools are not theories or\nmodels in the ordinary sense. Thus, as a discipline, it is appears\ninterestingly unique and ultimately unlike ones that philosophers of\nscience have typically examined. Third, conservation biology was\noriginally articulated by the early pioneers as a \u201ccrisis\ndiscipline\u201d where certain types of normative concerns were at\nthe forefront. In fact, many have likened it to medicine insofar as it\nhas ethical foundations. In the medical case, it would be the\nwell-being of patients and in conservation biology it is the\nconservation of biodiversity. Thus, we should ask are the\ndiscipline\u2019s aims or values explicitly ethical or sociopolitical\nand to what extent are they controversial?\n", "toc": [{"#WhatBiod": "1.

What is Biodiversity?\n\nStrangely enough, we can roughly date when the term\n\u2018biodiversity\u2019 was coined (Takacs 1996: 34\u201340). It\noccurred during the National Forum on BioDiversity sponsored by the\nSmithsonian Institution and the National Academy of the Sciences\n21\u201324 September 1986. Approximately 14,000 people attended what was a\nmedia spectacle that included the likes of Jared Diamond, Paul\nEhrlich, Thomas Eisner, G. Evelyn Hutchinson, Ernst Mayr, Charles D.\nMichener, Harold A. Mooney, Peter Raven, and E. O. Wilson. The coiner\nof the term is thought to be Walter G. Rosen. He said,\n\n\nIt was easy to do: all you do is take the \u2018logical\u2019 out of\n\u2018biological\u2019\u2026. To the take the logical out of\nsomething that\u2019s supposed to be science is a bit of a\ncontradiction in terms, right? And yet, of course, maybe so logical\nthat there seems to be no room for emotion in there, no room for\nspirit. (Takacs 1996: 37)\n\n\nAs David Takacs noted, a search in Biological Abstracts for\nthe year 1988 would not contain it as a keyword. For 1993, it appeared\nseventy-two times. As of March 2015, Google Scholar reports that\n\u2018biodiversity\u2019 appears in the title of over one hundred\nthousand papers. The term clearly has caught on. But, we are getting\nahead of ourselves.\n\nConservation biology clearly concerns conserving something biological\nor ecological, but what is or should be conserved? Work has focused on\na variety of units. As examples, some have focused on species such as\nthe spotted owl Strix occidentalis (Yaffee 1994) and\nloggerhead turtle Caretta caretta (Bolten & Witherington\n2003); some have focused on populations and sub-species such as wild\nsalmon Oncorhynchus spp. (Quinn 2005); some have focused on\nbiomes or eco-regions such as tropical coral in the Great Barrier Reef\n(Hutchings, Kingsford, & Hoegh-Guldberg 2008); and finally some\nhave focused on genotypes or genetic features such as heterozygosity\n(Avise & Hamrick 1996). However, in the 1980s, conservation\nbiologists united and argued that biodiversity should be the\nfocus of the discipline (E. O. Wilson 1988; see entry on\n biodiversity).\n What then is biodiversity? Here is a standard definition from an\ninfluential textbook.\n\n\nBiological diversity, or biodiversity, is the sum total of all living\nthings\u2014the immense richness and variation of the living world.\nBiodiversity can be considered at many levels of biological variation,\nranging from genetic variability within a species, to the biota of\nsome selected region of the globe, to the number of evolutionary\nlineages and the degree of distinctness among them, to the diversity\nof ecosystems and biomes on Earth. (Groom et al. 2006: 27)\n\n\nInformally then, biodiversity is variation at all levels of the\nbiological hierarchy. To conserve biodiversity would then to be to\nconserve all of this variation. However, there are two fundamental\nissues to be resolved. First, there is an issue of practicality. As\nphilosopher and conservation biologist Sahotra Sarkar writes,\n\n\nConserving biodiversity, and construing the term intuitively to refer\nto all the biological diversity that there is, at every level of both\nhierarchies amounts to saying that \u201cbiodiversity\u201d refers\nto all biological entities. \u201cBiodiversity\u201d in effect\nbecomes all of biology. Conservation would be an impractical proposal\nif biodiversity were construed in this way: everything biological\nwould become a goal of conservation. (Sarkar 2005: 180)\n\n\nIn fact the issue is more complicated than even this. In order to\nestimate the amount of biodiversity with regard to a place, we must\nfind some true surrogate (Margules & Sarkar 2007: Ch. 2). A true\nsurrogate is some feature that strongly correlates with biodiversity.\nSuppose we used species as a true surrogate. With few exceptions, we\ncannot simply observe the species present in some locale; we can only\nobserve some of its members. We must use some estimator surrogate for\nthe true surrogate too; e.g., soil, vegetation, precipitation, etc.\nThus, we estimate biodiversity twice removed. Second, since we cannot\nconserve all biological variation, we need a principled way to decide\nwhat to conserve. As we saw above, conservation biologists have\nrefined their account to include variation in genes, species, and\necosystems. This is still far too broad since there is a great deal of\n\u201cjunk DNA\u201d; often we want to conserve wild populations\n(e.g., wild salmon versus hatchery salmon); and rare habitats are\noften considered more important than common ones (Morgan 2009).\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we consider three recent proposals\nconcerning what biodiversity is (and is not) that try to characterize\nbiodiversity in a practical and principled manner.\n1.1 Biodiversity as Multidimensional\n\nOne attempt to provide a principled and practical way to characterize\nbiodiversity comes from Maclaurin & Sterelny (2008). James\nMaclaurin and Kim Sterelny start with the suggestion that we find the\nrelevant \u201cnatural\u201d units and then provide means for\nmeasuring variation with regard to those units. By\n\u2018natural\u2019 units, they mean ones that identify properties\nthat are recognizable and are causally salient (Maclaurin &\nSterelny 2008: 10). As discussions of phenetic taxonomy have shown,\nmeasures of \u201coverall similarity\u201d are fraught with\nsubjectivity. This subjectivity depends on a choice of distance metric\nand on how one articulates character traits (Ereshefsky 2000:\n60\u201366). Contemporary taxonomists group taxa according to\npatterns of evolutionary descent, which is a method called\n\u201ccladistics\u201d, precisely to avoid such subjectivity given\nthat the evolutionary history of life is natural in the above sense\n(Baum & Smith 2013).\n\nMaclaurin and Sterelny contend that the fundamental unit of\nbiodiversity is species and specifically species richness.\nNotoriously, biologists and philosophers have debated the nature of\nspecies. However, Maclaurin and Sterelny defend an evolutionary\nconcept of species which states that \u201cEvolutionary species are\nlineages of organisms with their \u2018own evolutionary tendencies\nand historical fate\u2019\u201d (Maclaurin & Sterelny 2008: 33;\nsee Wiley 1978). They suggest that this is the more natural approach\nto species because,\n\n\nThe living world is organized into phenomenological species:\nrecognizable, reidentifiable clusters of organisms. This fact makes\nthe production of bird and butterfly field guides, identification keys\nfor invertebrates, regional floras, and the like, all\npossible\u2026. There are many routes through which one population\ncan become demographically isolated from, and hence evolutionarily\nindependent of, populations that were once sources and sinks of its\nown genes. But the fact of isolation and evolutionary independence is\nof immense importance to the fate of local adaptation in such\npopulations. So the phenomenological species richness of a region is,\nin an importance sense, a catalogue both of phenotypic variety and of\nthe potential evolutionary resources available in that region.\n(Maclaurin & Sterelny 2008: 40)\n\n\nThat is, though a variety of evolutionary processes lead to the\nformation and cohesion of organisms into species, there nevertheless\nis a uniformity of pattern in the natural world.\n\nSpecies richness with regard to a given community, a group of\ninteracting species in a given place, is the number of species\npresent. We might also add species evenness to species richness\n(Magurran 1988, 2004). With respect to a given community, there will\nbe some number of species. However, suppose we have two species in\nwhich the first has 300 members but the second has 700. Suppose again\nwe have two species where the first has 500 members and the second 500\nas well. The second community of species is far more\n\u201ceven\u201d than the first. One formal representation of\nevenness is as follows (Magurran 1988). We start with the\nShannon-Weiner diversity index. \n\n\\[\nH' = -\\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln p_i\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(p_i\\) is the proportion of organisms belonging to the \\(i\\)th\nspecies and \\(S\\) is the total number of species. If we define the\nfollowing, \n\n\\[\nH_\\text{max}' = - \\sum_{i=1}^{S}\\frac{1}{S} \\ln \\frac{1}{S} = \\ln S\n\\]\n\n\nWe now have a measure of species evenness, \n\n\\[\nJ' = \\frac{H'}{H_\\text{max}'}\n\\]\n\n\n\\(J'\\) takes a value between 0 and 1 and the closer to the value of 1,\nthe less variation between the number of individuals in a species.\n\nThe second way in which we might augment species richness is through\ndisparity, morphological diversity, or more simply, phenotypic\nvariation (Maclaurin & Sterelny 2008: Ch. 3, 4; see Gould 1989 for\na discussion of disparity in the history of life). Disparity,\nmorphological diversity, or phenotypic vacation in general, concern\nthe variation in phenotypic traits exhibited in and between species.\nSuppose we have one suite of species that are very similar\nphenotypically; however, we might have another suite of species that\nvary a great deal phenotypically. A measure of such variation would\nweight species richness with some parameter(s) representing the\nvariation in phenotypic traits. Unfortunately, if we include such\nphenotypic variation per se we find ourselves exactly with\nthe problems that dogged phenetic taxonomy and the attempt to capture\nsome notion of overall similarity. Additionally, if we focus on\ndisparity per se as opposed to mere phenotypic variation, we\nmust try to capture some notion of basic \u201cbody plan\u201d\n(Arthur 2000).\n\nMaclaurin and Sternly suggest that one way to operationalize such\nvariation is through the notion of a morphospace (Maclaurin\n& Sterelny 2008: Section 4.4). Suppose we have a \\(n\\)-dimensional\nhyperspace where each dimension \\(i\\) is a variable concerning the\n\\(i\\)th phenotype. Thus, a point in the space represents a specific\norganism and their phenotype trait. Associated with any given species\nwould be a hypervolume representing the phenotypic variation of that\nspecies. Though there are not many worked out hyperspaces of this\nsort, a famous one is paleontologist David Raup\u2019s analysis of\nthe coiling patterns in mollusks that includes variables for whorl\nexpansion rate, uncoiling rate, translation of the generating curve,\nand shape of the growing edge (Raup 1966).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Raup\u2019s coiling patterns\nin mollusks morphospace (Raup 1966)\n\n\nThe morphospace describes actual coiling patterns and merely possible\nones, and raises explananda for evolutionary biologists. Why\ndid certain coiling patterns evolve and not others? Maclaurin and\nSterelny claim morphospaces will be of low dimensionality and\nspecifically limited to lineages or clades (Maclaurin & Sterelny\n2008: 75\u20139). Thus, biologists must be assured that the variables\nincluded are representative of the phenotypic traits of the organisms\nand hence species under study. They hypothesize that the variables\nwill correspond to developmental modules or mosaics, which are a\nrelatively independent developmental system that contributes to\nfitness (G. P. Wagner 2014; P. J. Wagner 1995). This approach of\ncourse assumes that there exist independent developmental systems, and\nideally it would help articulate how a lineage would fare over time as\na function of its plasticity.\n\nAnother component of biodiversity according to Maclaurin and Sterelny\nconcerns the ecological interactions between species (Morin 2011).\nThis additional structure is given by interspecific competition,\npredator-prey relations, and mutualism along with possible\nhigher-order ones like trophic cascades. In the absence of such\ninteractions, a group of species is nothing more than the \u201csum\nof the parts\u201d (Clements 1916; Eliot 2011; Gleason 1926;\nOdenbaugh 2007; R.H. Whittaker 1967). In the presence of such\ninteractions, they hypothesize the existence of emergent properties\nthat are not a \u201csimple reflection\u201d of the species\nthemselves (Maclaurin & Sterelny 2008: 120). Additionally, even if\nthere were no such emergent properties, we would like to know what\ntheir causal contribution is: how to do they drive community patterns?\nInfamously, some ecologists have hypothesized that as the diversity of\na community increases, so does the stability of the community (Egerton\n1973; Elton 2000; MacArthur 1955; May 1973/2001; Tilman, Wedin, &\nKnops 1996). \u2018Diversity\u2019 can be understood as the number\nof species present, the number of interactions, or intensity of those\ninteractions. \u2018Stability\u2019 can be understood in a variety\nof ways from notions of Lyapunov stability, return time after a\nperturbation, biomass stability, etc. (Justus 2008; Pimm 1984).\nEcologists have theorized, experimented, and collected a great deal of\ndata regarding this hypothesis, but its truth remains elusive.\nMaclaurin and Sterelny suggest we can articulate an ecospace including\nat least the boundedness, degree of emergent properties, and internal\nregulation as variables to describe ecological communities (Maclaurin\n& Sterelny 2008: Ch. 6). One serious worry is whether any of these\nfeatures can be measured in an informative way. But, insofar as there\nare no community boundaries, no emergent properties, and no internal\nregulation, there are no communities. The robustness of communities\nwould require each of these take non-zero values. Additionally, these\nvariables are not independent and hence the ecospace would have to\ntake account of the interactions between each variable. For example,\ninternal regulation might be a function of the emergent properties\npossessed by the community, and the boundaries of a given community\ndetermined by those very properties (Sterelny 2006).\n\nFinally, we can consider how to include phylogenetic information in\nour measure of biodiversity. One method comes from Daniel Faith (1992,\n1994, 2002). In cladistics, we use character traits to divide\norganisms into groups. We begin with the traits shared by all of the\norganisms and then articulate smaller groups by traits unique to them\nwhere each then is a clade. A cladogram then displays the distinct\ncharacter traits of each group. Cladograms differ from phylogenetic\ntrees insofar as the latter includes ancestor-descendant relations\napart from merely relations of nested similarity. For any phylogenetic\ntree, there are many cladograms consistent with it. Faith writes,\n\n\nThe phylogenetic diversity (\u2019PD\u2019) of \\(s\\) is equal to the\nsum of the lengths of all those branches that are members of the\ncorresponding minimum spanning path. (Faith 1992: 4)\n\n\nConsider the following cladogram.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The phylogenetic diversity\nrepresented in a cladogram (Faith 1992: 3)\n\n\nIn Figure 2, we have taxa 2, 6, 8, 10. The minimum spanning path\nconnecting each requires 28 character changes and thus its PD is 28.\nAs Maclaurin and Sterelny note, this assumes that we have an adequate\nsample of character traits and given that many are molecular they do\nnot tell us much about phenotypes (Maclaurin & Sterelny 2008:\n141). Thus, they suggest we stick with local morphospaces.\n\nMaclaurin and Sterelny\u2019s approach is very suggestive but as we\nhave seen its execution by biologists requires making good on using\nspecies richness augmented with information regarding phenotypic\nvariation, ecology, development, and phylogeny into an empirical\ntractable hyperspace. The extent to which this can be done is unclear\n(Justus 2010; Morgan 2009). Their approach also presupposes a\nparticular account of species as well.\n1.2 Operationalizing Biodiversity\n\nSahotra Sarkar attempts to define biodiversity\n\u201cimplicitly\u201d as opposed to \u201cexplicitly\u201d\ncontrary to Maclaurin and Sterelny (Margules & Sarkar 2007; Sarkar\n2002, 2005; Sarkar & Margules 2002). A concept is given an\nexplicit definition if, and only if, there is a set of necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the satisfaction of the concept. For\nexample, suppose we define the concept species\nphylogenetically in the following way: necessarily, something is a\nspecies if, and only if, it is a lineage between two speciation events\nor a speciation event and an extinction event (Ridley 1989). An\nimplicit definition is different; the concept is defined by some rules\nor axioms in which the concept appears. So, Sarkar characterizes biodiversity\nas follows,\n\n\n[B]iodiversity should be (implicitly) operationally defined as what is\nbeing optimized by the place prioritization procedures that prioritize\nall places on the basis of their biodiversity content using true\nsurrogates. (Sarkar 2005: 182)\n\n\nTo understand this account, we need to articulate what a place\nprioritization procedure is (Sarkar et al. 2002; Sarkar 2005:\n159\u201368). In the abstract, place prioritization starts with a\nlist of places (\u201ccells\u201d) and a list of surrogates that\nmust be represented at a certain target in a conservation area\nnetwork. We either want to select the smallest set of cells such that\nevery one of our surrogates meets it target, or select those cells\nsubject to a given size, which maximizes the number of surrogates at\nor above the relevant target. Place prioritization is a component of a\nconsensus framework called systematic conservation planning that we\nwill discuss below. However, in effect, it is a procedure for\nprioritizing places for their \u201cbiodiversity content\u201d for\ncreating conservation area networks in which we incorporate\ninformation regarding the design of the area. This can include the\nshape of the network, its size, dispersion, and connectivity. This is\ntypically put more formally as follows (Sarkar 2005: 161). First,\nsuppose we begin with a set \\(\\Sigma\\) of places or cells\n\\(\\sigma_{j}\\); thus, \\(\\Sigma = \\{\\sigma_{j} \\mid \\sigma_{j} \\in\n\\Sigma\\}\\) for \\(j = 1, 2,\\ldots, n\\). Second, we have a set \\(\\Lambda\\)\nof surrogates \\(\\lambda_{i}\\); thus, \\(\\Lambda = \\{\\lambda_{i} \\mid\n\\lambda_{i} \\in \\Lambda\\}\\) for \\(i = 1, 2,\\ldots,m\\). Third, we have\ntargets for the representation of their expected coverage \\(\\tau_{i}\\)\nfor \\(i= 1, 2,\\ldots., m\\). Place prioritization then takes the form\nof two problems:\n\n\n\nMinimum Area: selection the smallest set of cell \\(\\Gamma\\) such that\nevery surrogate meets their target of representation;\n\n\nMaximum Representation: given the cardinality \\(\\kappa \\leq n\\) of\n\\(\\Gamma\\), select those cells that maximize the number of surrogates\nfor which the expected coverage exceeds the targets of\nrepresentation.\n\n\nThe former problem has economic constraints but none on the number of\nplaces whereas the second has a constraint on the total number of\nplaces.\n\nAs we saw above, true surrogates consist in species, characters or\ntraits, life-zones, or environmental parameters. Estimator surrogates\nconsist in environmental parameter composition, soil-type composition,\ndominant vegetation composition, subsets of species composition, and\nsubsets of genus or other higher taxon composition. So, biodiversity\nis preserved by preserving true surrogates through preserving\nestimator surrogates (Sarkar 2005: 168\u201373). To a first\napproximation, a place prioritization procedure optimizes the number\nof estimators and thus true surrogates with respect to place, and what\nis so optimized is biodiversity. Biodiversity just is what is\noptimized by this procedure.\n\nThere are several concerns worth mentioning with regard to how this\nprocedure implicitly defines biodiversity.\nFirst, since we are operationalizing the concept biodiversity,\nit is simply defined by what a place\nprioritization procedure optimizes. Thus, it cannot be in error with\nregard to whether it has captured some pre-theoretic notion. It rules\nout the possibility of mistake (Hempel 1966: Ch. 7). We do not think\nthat the concept of temperature is just\nwhatever is measured by thermometers (Chang 2004). Second, insofar as\nthere are different place prioritization procedures, they will\nimplicitly define distinct concepts. They will not be measuring the\nsame magnitude. Third, concept explication requires that the\nexplicatum be distinct but sufficiently similar to the\nexplicandum for the analysis to be of theoretical value\n(Carnap 1950/1962: Ch.1). There are two ways of seeing how the\nconcept(s) articulated by Sarkar differ from our \u201cordinary\u201d\nones. The concept most conservation biologists articulate is\ncategorical and not relational. The concept is similarly imbued with\nmuch moralizing as we shall see and one can be competent with the one\nand not the other. Hence, one might argue that they are different\nconcepts (Odenbaugh 2009). As David Takacs writes,\n\n\nBiodiversity is the rallying cry currently used by biologists to draw\nattention to this crisis and to encapsulate the Earth\u2019s myriad\nspecies and biological processes, as well as a host of values ascribed\nto the natural world. (Takacs 1996: 9)\n\n\nAt first blush, one might wonder if this is the same thing articulated\nby place prioritization procedures.\n1.3 Eliminating Biodiversity\n\nRecently philosopher Carlos Santana has argued that we should\neliminate the concept of biodiversity from conservation biology\n(Santana 2014). He writes,\n\n\nBiodiversity is generally the assumed target of conservation biology,\nbut the biological world is composed of a number of distinct types of\ndiversity, which only loosely correlate with each other and with\nbiological value. Since the function of the biodiversity concept in\nconservation science is to help us preserve or increase biological\nvalue, we should therefore consider eliminating biodiversity from its\nprivileged position in conservation theory and practice. (Santana\n2014: 778)\n\n\nAs we have seen, we begin with a notion of biodiversity which can be\nestimated by a true surrogate but which actually is empirically\ntracked through a estimator surrogate. However, Santana points out\nthat we are concerned with biodiversity because of the\n\u201cbiological values\u201d associated with it. This leads to two\nsequences (Santana 2014: 765):\n\n\n\nestimator surrogate \\(\\rightarrow\\) true surrogate \\(\\rightarrow\\)\nbiodiversity \\(\\rightarrow\\) biological value\n\n\nestimator surrogate \\(\\rightarrow\\) true surrogate \\(\\rightarrow\\)\nbiological value\n\n\nSantana contends that (2) is preferable to (1). Why does he think\nthis? He argues that both Maclaurin and Sterelny\u2019s and\nSarkar\u2019s respective attempts at defining\n\u2018biodiversity\u2019 fail. Moreover, since according to Santana,\nusing the concept in conservation biology does more harm than good, we\nshould eliminate its use.\n\nFirst, Santana argues that there are many different sorts of diversity\nof biological value that cannot be subsumed by any single true\nsurrogate like species richness (Santana 2014: 768\u20139). For\nexample, we often wish to conserve biomes such as old growth forests\nor coral reefs independent of their composition of species. Or, we\nmight want to conserve distinct salmonoid populations even if they are\nof the same species. Second, assuming that there is a single or small\nnumber of true surrogates, such as species richness, ignores the fact\nthat not all species are of equal biological value. A species of\npollinator or top predator like the grey wolf is of greater than value\nthan some species of minnow. Additionally, there are values that are\nonly tendentiously connected to species richness like\n\u201cwildness\u201d or aesthetic value. Third, some species are of\ngreat disvalue. For example, many would argue that taxa like Ebola\nwould be better extinguished. If this is correct, Santana contends\nthat there is no single true surrogate through which biodiversity can\nbe articulated. We must eliminate the notion of biodiversity.\n\nThe second part of Santana\u2019s argument is this pluralism is\nunproblematic only if there is some true surrogate that covaries with\nthe other surrogates and hence biological value (Santana 2014:\n768\u201373). However, he complains that the available evidence\nsuggests this is false. If we augment species richness with abundance\nwe will not capture certain biological values since, for example, the\nrarity of a bird species increases its value and does not reduce it.\nPhenotypic variation requires the sort of morphospaces discussed\nabove, but these as we saw are local and cannot be compared across\nvery different taxa. Hence, even if we augment species richness with\nphenotypic variation we are unable to determine the biodiversity\npresent in comparable ways. Likewise, evolutionary diversity of the\nsort that Faith described does not necessarily correlate with species\nrichness. In one study of the South Africa\u2019s cape region, it was\ndetermined that the eastern region of the cape had greater\nevolutionary diversity as measured by the number of speciation events\nbetween clades whilst the western region of the cape had greater\nspecies richness (Mooers 2007). Speciation events are often\nunrecoverable from the fossil record and so this sort of diversity\ncannot typically augment species richness. Lastly, as we noted above,\nthe connection between species richness and ecological properties like\nstability is extremely complicated and controversial. It has not been\nshow in a robust manner that greater species richness leads to greater\necosystem or food web stability.\n\nThus, there are many different types of diversity encoded in the sorts\nof true surrogates we would like to conserve and they do not\npositively correlate in straightforward ways. If this is right,\nSantana contends that the concept of biodiversity in effect is not\ntracking a feature of the biological world. At most it is a\nplaceholder for whatever conservation biologists choose to conserve.\nThe concept has certainly made its way into public discourse and one\nmight worry that this would be extremely disruptive if we removed it\nfrom conservation practice. However, Santana suggests we should not\ntry to decide what to conserve based on some elusive property of\nbiological systems, which really is just a disjunction of very\ndifferent diversities. Rather, the tools through which value conflicts\nare best articulated is from political science and economics (Colyvan,\nJustus, & Regan 2011; Frank & Sarkar 2010). Regardless of the\ntools used, Santana argues that we should bypass the concept of\nbiodiversity and consider the biological values that we share and\nevaluate true surrogates on those grounds.\n\nThe discipline of conservation biology has settled on biodiversity as\nits purported object of study. However, there is a serious debate over\nwhether biodiversity is some natural possibly multidimensional feature\nor whatever is arrived at through procedures proposed in designing\nconservation area networks. And, some even have argued that it should\nbe eliminated from scientific practice. It is possible by taking the\n\u2018logical\u2019 out of \u2018biological diversity\u2019 we\nhave a politically expedient term which is scientifically\nproblematic.\n2. What is Conservation Biology?\n\nWhether or not there is a single thing that conservation biology as a\ndiscipline purports to conserve, there are philosophical questions to\nbe raised regarding the discipline itself. Specifically, is it a\ncollection of theories or models or something else? To explore this\nquestion, we will consider central examples of conservation\nbiology\u2019s practice. We can then turn to how best to understand\nwhat conservation biology is. But first, it useful to consider what\ntheories and models are.\n\nTraditionally, philosophers of science have typically focused on\ntheories, which they assumed were sets of natural laws (Hempel 1966)\n(see entry on\n laws of nature).\n Examples of laws of nature include the following. Newton\u2019s\nuniversal law of gravitation is \\(F_{ab} = G(m_a m_b)/r^2\\) which\nstates that the gravitational force between two objects \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional the\nsquare of their distance. Newton\u2019s second law of motion is\n\\(\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a}\\) where the vector sum of forces\n\\(\\mathbf{F}\\) equals mass \\(m\\) times acceleration vector\n\\(\\mathbf{a}\\). Finally, there is the Boyle-Charles ideal gas law\nwhich is \\(PV = nRT\\) which says that the pressure \\(P\\) and volume\n\\(V\\) of a gas is proportional to its temperature \\(T\\). Philosophers\nof science and metaphysicians debate what makes statements like those\nabove laws. The answers include generalizations concerning empirical\nregularities (Ayer 1956), relations between universals (Dretske 1977),\nthe best system that trades simplicity in primitives for explanatory\npower (Lewis 1983), encode various symmetries (Fraassen 1989), and so\non. One powerful worry with thinking that theories are sets of laws of\nnature is that if, at a minimum, laws are true universal\ngeneralizations, then there no such laws at least in the special\nsciences since those generalizations have exceptions (Beatty 1995;\nCartwright 1983). That is, they are false. As the result of this\nargument amongst others, philosophers of science have increasingly\nfocused on models (Giere 2010; Odenbaugh 2005; Weisberg 2012) (see\nentry on\n models in science).\n\nModels are a type of representation that involve abstractions and\nidealizations (Cartwright 1999; Chakravartty 2001; Weisberg 2012).\nAbstraction in a representation involves not including all of the\nproperties of the thing represented and idealization involves\ndistorting those features that are represented. That is, models delete\nand distort. Another important feature of models is that they\nindirectly represent the world. According to many philosophers of\nscience, models describe mathematical or abstract objects, and these\nobjects are more or less similar to particular objects in the world\n(Weisberg (2012), but see Hughes (1997; Odenbaugh 2014)). Theories as\nsets of laws represent the world directly because their propositional\ncontent is about natural systems. There are a number of different\ntypes of models used which include physical, scale, computational, and\nmathematical models.\n\nIn the biological sciences especially, one rarely hears talk of laws;\nrather, it is models that are discussed. We can begin by considering a\nsimple model used in conservation biology, a metapopulation model\n(Hanski & Gilpin 1997; Levins 1970). A metapopulation is a\npopulation of populations that are subdivided spatially, but are\ncausally connected through migration. Let \\(P\\) be the proportion of\npatches occupied by a species, \\(c\\) is the rate of patch\ncolonization, and \\(e\\) is the rate of patch extinction. Thus, the\ninstantaneous rate of change in the proportion of occupied patches is\nthe proportion of patches colonized minus those in which extinctions\noccur. Mathematically, we have, \n\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = cP(1 - P) - eP\n\\]\n\n\nWhen \\(dP/dt=0\\), the non-trivial equilibrium proportion is \\(P^{*}=\n(c-e)/c = 1 - e/c\\). Thus, if the equilibrium proportion is greater\nthan zero, then the rate of colonization must be greater than the rate\nof extinction; namely, \\(P^{*} > 0\\) just in case \\(c > e\\).\nGiven that this is a model, there are abstractions and idealizations\nincluding the assumptions that the local populations are identical in\ntheir chances of colonization and going extinct, rates of colonization\nand extinction are constants, and distance between patches does not\nmatter. Models can be characterized by three features\u2014their\nparameters, variables, and laws (Otto & Day 2007). Parameters\ndescribe properties that are constant in value, variables describe\nproperties that change, and laws simply describe relationships between\nparameters and variables. Thus, \\(P\\) is a variable, \\(c\\) and \\(e\\)\nare parameters, and the equation \\(dP/dt = cP(1- P) - eP\\) is law.\nNote that the term \u2018law\u2019 used by modelers is not\nnecessarily the same as that of a law of nature. For example, a\nmodeler might call the differential equation above a law even if it is\nnot true of any metapopulation.\n\nConservation biologists use models all the time in almost every facet\nof their work. So we now consider several case studies of conservation\nbiology.\n2.1 Northern Spotted Owls\n\nMetapopulation models are extremely important and have been used in\none of the most difficult of environmental debates, that surrounding\nthe northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) and its\nhabitat (Durbin 1996; Norse 1990; Yaffee 1994). The northern spotted\nowl is a subspecies that lives exclusively in old-growth coniferous\nforests in northern California, western Washington and Oregon.\nNorthern spotted owls are monogamous and each breeding pair uses one\nto three square miles of forest that is at least two-hundred and fifty\nyears old. Farms, logging and other forms of development reduced\nnorthern spotted owl habitat. So, scientists and policymakers began to\nask what must we do if we are to prevent them from going extinct? One\nway of answering that question is to use metapopulation models.\n\nIn 1985, environmental lawyer Andrew Stahl presented mathematical\nbiologist Russell Lande just this question Yaffee (1994: 98). He\nshowed Lande the US Forest Service\u2019s \u201cregional\nguide\u201d which was their plan to protect the northern spotted owl\nand asked Lande to determine if it would be sufficient. Using a\nvariety of data, he devised the following metapopulation model to try\nto answer this question (Lande 1988a but see Lande 1988b as well). Let\n\\(\\epsilon\\) be the probability that a juvenile female inherits her\nmother\u2019s territory, \\(m\\) be the number of territories a\njuvenile can disperse through before dying, \\(h\\) be the proportion of\nhabitable territory, and \\(p\\) be the proportion of occupied habitable\nsites. Therefore, the probability of a female not finding habitable\nterritory in \\(m\\) trials is, \n\n\\[\n(1-\\epsilon)(ph+1-h)^m\n\\]\n\n\nThis just is the probability of not inheriting the territory of\none\u2019s mother and not successfully dispersing to an unoccupied\nterritory before death. Female northern spotted owls reproduce only\nwhen they are three years old and we can represent their growth rate\nby \\(\\lambda = N_{t+1}/N_t\\). When \\(\\lambda = 1\\), the species is in\na demographic equilibrium. Assuming they are in such an equilibrium,\nthen, \n\n\\[\n[1-(1-\\epsilon)(ph + 1 - h)^m] R'_{0} =1\n\\]\n\n\n\\(R_{0}' = \\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty}l_{x}'f_x\\) where \\(l_{x}'\\) is the\nprobability of surviving to age \\(x\\) assuming she has found habitable\nterritory and \\(f_x\\) is the mean lifetime offspring production per\nfemale assuming she finds habitable territory. Finally, we can solve\nthe following, \n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} = \\left\\{\n     \\begin{array}{lr}\n       1 - \\frac{1-k}{h} & \\text{for}  \\ h > 1 - k\\\\\n       0 & \\text{for} \\ h \\leq 1 - k\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right.\n\\]\n\n\nIn the above, \\(k\\) is the equilibrium occupancy of the territory.\nGiven this model, the northern spotted owl can persist if, and only\nif, \\(h > 1- k\\). Lande determined that in 1987, 38% of forest in\nwestern Washington and Oregon was older than two hundred years. So,\n\\(h = 0.38\\). Fieldwork suggests that 44% of sites were occupied.\nThus, \\(p = 0.44\\). We can determine \\(k\\) from this equation,\n\\(k=1-h(1-p)\\). Hence, \\(k = 0.79\\). The forest plans suggested\nleaving between \\(7 - 16\\%\\) of 200 or more year old forest. But given\nthat \\(1 - k = 0.21\\), Lande argued \\(7 - 16\\%\\) was insufficient and\nthe forest plans should be revised. Lande and others\u2019 work led\nto the US Forest Service withdrawing six old growth forest timber\nsales in Oregon and Washington and became a component of the 1994\nadoption of the Northwest Forest Plan that protected 8 million acres\nof old-growth forests. This was an increase to protecting 80% of the\nowl\u2019s remaining habitat in comparison to 5% protected by the\nForest Service\u2019s original owl plan.\n\nModels like Lande\u2019s, and population viability analysis (PVA)\nmore generally, often are susceptible to several criticisms (see\nBeissinger & McCullough (2002) for a discussion of PVA, and\nWimsatt (1981) for a discussion of the robustness and fragility of\nmodels). They exhibit parameter and structural sensitivity; if we\nchange the parameter values or change the assumptions of the models,\nwe often find very different results. For example, Patrick Foley\nexamined a model of grizzly bears Ursus arctic in Yellowstone\nNational Park that incorporated environmental stochasticity along with\nintrinsic growth rates and carrying capacity (Foley 1994). The model\nfor estimated values of the above predicted the expected time to\nextinction was 12, 000 years. However, he later examined a model which\nincluded demographic and environmental stochasticity but set\ndemographic stochasticity to zero (Foley 1997). The expected time to\nextinction was approximately 50 years. Thus, PVA models can be very\nfragile with respect to their parameter values and functional\nforms.\n\nOf course, Lande\u2019s metapopulation model is clearly abstracted\nand idealized. However, he argued that his model was consistent with\nthe data and that his predictions were more conservative than that of\na more realistic model. First, he argued that the data showed that the\nannual geometric growth rate of the northern spotted was not\nsignificantly different from equilibrium (e.g., \\(0.96 \\pm0.03\\), see\nLande 1988a: 605). Second, if we assume that owls have difficulty\nfinding mates, or dispersal is more limited, or there is demographic\nor environmental stochasticity, this would reduce \\(k\\) even\nfurther.\n2.2 Island Biogeography\n\nIsland biogeography concerns the distribution and abundances of\nspecies on islands. One of the fundamental patterns the biologists\nhave attempted to explain is the species-area effect. That is, why do\nlarger islands support more species than smaller ones? It seems that\nas the area of an island increases, so does species richness. The\nspecies-area effect is the product of the area effect namely that more\nspecies are found on larger islands rather than smaller, and the\ndistance effect namely that islands closer to the mainland have more\nspecies than those that are further. E. O. Wilson and Robert H.\nMacArthur provided one of the famous potential explanations of the\nspecies area effect. They did so through their equilibrium model of\nisland biogeography (MacArthur & Wilson 1963, 1967). They began\nwith several assumptions. First, species richness on an island has a\nstable equilibrium. Second, the stable equilibrium is due to the\nimmigration rate from the mainland to the island and the extinction\nrate on the island. Third, the distance of the island from the\nmainland by itself determines the rate of immigration. Fourth, the\nextinction rate is determined solely by the island\u2019s size.\nFifth, the stable equilibrium is a dynamic one. The number of species\nare the island is constant, but the composition of species on the\nisland changes. This rate of change is the species turnover rate.\n\nMacArthur and Wilson formulated a mathematical model with these\nassumptions (Wilson & Bossert 1971). Suppose \\(P\\) is a parameter\nrepresenting a pool of species. Let the total immigration rate\n\\(\\lambda_{S}\\) be the number of new species colonizing an island per\nunit time. Let the total extinction rate \\(\\mu_{S}\\) be the number of\nspecies on the island going extinct per unit time. Thus, the\ninstantaneous rate of change of species on the island is,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\lambda_{S} - \\mu_{S}\n\\]\n\n\nIf \\(\\lambda_{S} = \\mu_{S}\\), then \\(dS/dt = 0\\), and we have an\nequilibrium \\(S^*\\). Assume that \\(S\\) species are present on our\nisland. We characterize the total immigration rate as follows. Let\n\\(\\lambda_{A}\\) be the average immigration rate of new species\ncolonizing the island per unit time, and thus the total immigration\nrate is \\(\\lambda_{S} = \\lambda_{A}(P-S)\\). The total extinction rate\ncan be characterized as well. Let the average extinction rate per\nspecies per unit be \\(\\mu_{A}\\). Then \\(\\mu_{S} = \\mu_{A}S.\\)\nTherefore, \\(dS/dt = \\lambda_{A}(P-S) - \\mu_{A}\\). Finally, we can\nderive \\(dS/dt\\) evaluated at the equilibrium \\(S^*\\), \n\n\\[\n\\Bigl.\\frac{dS}{dt}\\Bigr|_{\\substack{S=S^*}} = \\lambda_{S} - \\mu_{S} = \\lambda_{A}(P-S) - \\mu_{A}S = 0\n\\]\n\n\nThis is equivalent to the following expression \n\n\\[\nS^* = \\frac{\\lambda_{A}P}{\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A}}\n\\]\n\n\nBy integrating the differential equation, we have, \n\n\\[\nS^* = \\frac{\\lambda_{A}P}{\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A}}(1 - e^{-(\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A})^{t}})\n\\]\n\n\nAs \\(t\\) increases, \\( e^{-(\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A})^{t}}\\) approaches\nzero.\n\nWe can also derive an expression for the species turnover rate.\nMacArthur and Wilson as we saw thought that though the number of\nspecies on an island would be constant, their identities would be\nconstantly changing. Suppose we are interested in some fraction say\n90% of the equilibrium number of species \\(S^*\\). Then, we multiply\nboth sides of the above by \\(0.9\\), and have \\(0.9S^* =\n\\lambda_{A}P/(\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A}) \\times 0.9\\). From the above, it\nfollows that \\((1 - e^{-(\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A})^{t}}) = 0.9\\). With\nsome algebra and taking the natural logarithms, we arrive at the\nspecies turnover rate, \n\n\\[\nt_{0.9} = \\frac{2.3}{\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A}}\n\\]\n\n\nFinally, let us assume that each species \\(S_i\\)\u2019s size is\nproportional to the island\u2019s area and the probability that a\nspecies goes extinct decreases as island size becomes smaller.\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Equilibrium model and\nexplanation of the species area effect (MacArthur & Wilson 1967:\n26)\n\n\n\nWhere the immigration rate \\(I\\) and extinction rate \\(E\\) cross is\nthe species equilibrium \\(S^*\\) (Figure 3B). Moreover, the island\nwhose immigration rate is \\(I_\\text{near}\\) and whose extinction rate\nis \\(E_\\text{large}\\) has the largest species equilibrium. The one\nwith the smallest is the one with \\(I_\\text{far}\\) and\n\\(E_\\text{small}\\) (Figure 3A).\n\nAfter constructing their model, E. O. Wilson and his graduate student\nDaniel Simberloff tested the model by devising natural experiments in\nthe Florida keys (Simberloff & Wilson 1970). They had islands\ndefaunated of varying sizes and distances from the mainland. They\ncould then evaluate the predictions and assumptions of the model. They\ndetermined that species abundances returned to their previous\nequilibria and species richness on an island appeared to be determined\nby the size of the island and its distance from the mainland. However,\nSimberloff was able to show that the equilibrium model predicted that\nthe species turnover rate was much higher than what was measured\n(Simberloff 1976). In some ways, it is not a surprise that the model\nwas predictively inaccurate since it was highly idealized. MacArthur\nand Wilson had assumed distance alone determines the immigration rate\nand size alone determines the extinction rate. MacArthur and Wilson\nwrote,\n\n\nWe do not seriously believe that the particular formulations advanced\nin the chapters to follow will fit for very long the exacting results\nof future empirical investigation. We hope instead that they will\ncontribute to the stimulation of new forms of theoretical and\nempirical studies, which will lead in turn to a stronger general\ntheory\u2026. (MacArthur & Wilson 1967)\n\n\nBut conservation biologists quickly embraced the model and began to\napply it to new topics, the most important of which was reserve\ndesign.\n\nSeveral conservation biologists, but especially Jared Diamond, argued\nthat single large reserves were better than several small ones (SLOSS)\n(Diamond 1975a,b; May 1975; Terborgh 1975; Wilson & Willis\n1975).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Principles as depicted in the\nSLOSS debate (Diamond 1975b: 174)\n\n\nThe principles debated included (A) larger reserves are better than\nsmaller ones, (B) a large reserve is better than a few small ones of\nthe same total area, (C) several reserves close to one another are\nbetter than several further apart, (D) when there are several reserves\nthey should be grouped equidistantly rather then linearly, (E)\nreserves connected by corridors are better than unconnected ones, and\n(F) compact shapes are better for minimizing boundary length (1975b:\n143\u20135).\n\nOften the relation between species and area is represented by the\nfollowing equation, \\(S = kA^z\\) where \\(S\\) is species richness,\n\\(A\\) is area, and \\(k\\) and \\(z\\) are constants (\\(z\\) is usually\nbetween 0.2 and 0.35). Clearly, as \\(A\\) increases other things being\nequal, \\(S\\) should increase as well. So, it was argued that larger\nreserves are better for conserving species than smaller ones. Note\nthat if the reserve is isolated from other such reserves then only the\nextinction rate matters according to the equilibrium model. In 1976,\nDaniel Simberloff and Lawrence Abele argued that this line of argument\nwas incorrect (Simberloff & Abele 1976). Suppose we have a single\nreserve of size \\(A_1\\) and juxtapose it against two with size \\(A_2 =\nA_1/2\\) each and that \\(z = 0.263\\) (this precise value is not\nimportant to the argument). Each of the two small reserves would have\n\\(S_2 = kA_{2}^z\\) species. If all of the species \\(P\\) in the pool\nare capable of dispersing in and surviving in the refuges, then the\ntotal expected number of species in both refuges is \\(2S_2 -\nS_2^2/P\\); namely the species in either small reserve minus those in\nboth. How many species \\(S_1\\) would be in the large reserve \\(A_1\\)?\nSimberloff and Abele determined that \\(S_1 = kA_1^z = k(2A_2)^z =\n1.200 \\times S_2\\). They pointed out that this is less than the total\nexpected number of species \\(2S_2 - S_2^2/P\\) in the two smaller\nreserves when \\(S_1/P \\lt 0.96\\). Another important criticism of the\nuse of the equilibrium model in reserve design was that reserves were\nunlike islands in an ocean (Margules, Higgs, & Rafe 1982).\nSpecifically, the equilibrium model assumes that between the mainland\nand island no species of the pool can exist; i.e., the immigration\nrate is zero. However, when we consider areas between reserves, it\noften is possible for species to occur even if at lower abundances.\nThus, the equilibrium model could not be extended without violation of\nits assumptions to other habitat types such mountain tops (J.H. Brown\n1971).\n\nThe SLOSS debate was vociferous and the arguments continued for quite\nsome time. The importance of the equilibrium model of island\nbiogeography was much discussed and hotly contested (R.J. Whittaker\n& Fern\u00e1ndez-Palacios 2007).\n2.3 Systematic Conservation Planning\n\nThough the types of models we have just discussed have an important\nplace in the conservation biology and its history, it has become an\nexplicitly socio-ecological discipline in which sophisticated\ncomputational tools are used for the purpose of designing conservation\narea networks (see entry on\n social choice theory).\n From work involving population genetics and ecology for population\nviability analysis and the equilibrium model of MacArthur and Wilson,\nwith the associated SLOSS debate, we see a discipline transformed.\nWork on the genetics of inbreeding, habitat fragmentation,\nmetapopulation dynamics, and so on continues but in the guise of\nsomething more social; namely, systematic conservation planning (SCP)\n(Margules & Pressey 2000; Margules & Sarkar 2007; Watson et\nal. 2011). SCP involves a variety of steps including the\nfollowing:\n\n\n\nChoose and delimit the planning region.\n\n\nIdentify all stakeholders.\n\n\nCompile and assess all data.\n\n\nTreat data and construct models as necessary.\n\n\nIdentify and evaluate biodiversity constituents and\nsurrogates.\n\n\nSet explicit biodiversity goals and targets.\n\n\nReview existing conservation areas for performance with respect to\ntargets.\n\n\nPrioritize additional areas for conservation management.\n\n\nAssess biodiversity constituent and selected area\nvulnerabilities.\n\n\nRefine the network of selected areas.\n\n\nCarry out multi-criteria analysis.\n\n\nImplement conservation plan.\n\n\nMonitor network performance (Sarkar 2012: 100\u20133)\n\n\nThere are a variety of philosophical questions that are raised by SCP.\nFirst, who are the stakeholders in determining the boundaries of the\nanalysis, what are the relevant criteria to be used, and what is the\nfocal biotic unit? Second, what is biodiversity and what are the\nbiotic constituents we are trying to conserve and ensure persist?\nGiven problems with current definitions of \u2018biodiversity\u2019\nas we saw above, we must articulate what biodiversity constituents and\nsurrogates are, along with other diversity and persistence concepts.\nThird, given resource scarcity, efficiency is one of the goals of SCP,\nand thus how do we solve the minimum area and maximum representation\nproblems mentioned above? What is striking is how much the discipline\nincludes over and above models like the Lande metapopulation and\nMacArthur and Wilson equilibrium models. As Sahotra Sarkar writes,\n\n\nThus, in conservation biology, like computer science and unlike most\nof ecology, theoretical research consists of devising algorithms\nrather than formulating models and theories. In fact, because a\nvariety of algorithms can be used to solve these problems, a lot of\ntheoretical debate in conservation biology has been about the choice\nof algorithms. (Sarkar 2012: 124)\n\n\nWe have seen the role of place prioritization, which is key to SCP. We\nnext consider one other formal tool that is used to help make\ndecisions about how to accommodate different values in choosing\nconservation area networks.\n\nOne way to represent values would to be treat them as preferences\nusing the tools of neoclassical economics. Ideally we would reduce\nthese values to a single scale via a utility function. However, this\nis possible only if these values are commensurable (orderable on\nsingle scale). Some have argued that not all values can be so ordered.\nFor example, suppose you have to decide whether to be a lawyer or\nclarinetist (Raz 1986: 342). Neither seems better than the other and\nthey do not seem to be of equal value. Thus, we cannot rank them on a\nsingle scale. Nevertheless, if values are commensurable and we can\nmeasure them through people\u2019s willingness-to-pay for them or\nwillingness-to-be compensated for their loss, then they can be\nrepresented by a utility function. Multi-criteria analysis does not\nmake these two assumptions (Arrow & Raynaud 1986). Rather, the\npreferred method is determining a set of non-dominated alternatives\n(Moffett & Sarkar 2006). Suppose have a set of criteria \\(K =\n\\{\\kappa_i \\mid i = 1, 2,\\ldots, n\\}\\) and a set of feasible\nalternatives \\(A = \\{\\alpha_j \\mid j = 1, 2,\\ldots, m\\}\\) (for\ndetails, see Sarkar 2005: 196\u2013203). We will further assume that\neach criterion \\(\\kappa_i\\) induces a weak linear order \\(\\leq^*\\) on\n\\(A\\); that is, for any two \\(\\alpha_m, \\alpha_n \\in A, \\alpha_m\n\\leq_i^* \\alpha_n\\) or \\(\\alpha_n \\leq_i^* \\alpha_m\\) or both. Let\n\\(w_{im}\\) be the value of the \\(m\\)th alternative according to the\n\\(i\\)th criterion. We can say then that an alternative \\(\\alpha_m \\in\nA\\) is non-dominated by another alternative \\(\\alpha_n \\in\nA\\) with respect to \\(K\\) if, and only if: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\exists p, k_p \\in K \\textrm{ such that } \\  w_{pn} \\lt w_{pm}\\\\\n\\forall q, k_q \\in K, w_{qn} \\leq w_{qm}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nThis implies that \\(\\alpha_n\\) is strictly better than \\(\\alpha_m\\) by\nat least one criterion in \\(k_p \\in K\\), and it not worse than\n\\(\\alpha_m\\) by any criterion \\(k_i \\in K\\). An alternative \\(\\alpha_i\n\\in A\\) is non-dominated if, and only if, it is not dominated\nby any other element of \\(A\\). Thus, using multi-criteria analysis, we\nattempt to find a non-dominated set of alternatives from which to\ndesign conservation area networks. An example from Sarkar (2012:\n204\u20136) is briefly considered. We begin with place prioritization\nwith 100 attempts to create a prioritized lists of hexagons for a\ntarget of 10 representatives for each vertebrate species present in\nTexas. There were thirty-two feasible solutions\u2014ones that\nsatisfied the conservation target. However, two other criteria were\nused for multi-criteria analysis, economic cost and social cost. The\nfirst was estimated by the cost of the conservation plan per hexagon\nand the second was estimated by the human population size of each\nhexagon included. From the thirty-two feasible solutions, there were\nonly two non-dominated solutions selected by the multi-criteria\nanalysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Place prioritization and\nmulti-criteria analysis in Texas (Sarkar 2012: 206)\n\n\nNext we reflect on the case studies and then ask what exactly is\nconservation biology?\n2.4 Conservation Biology and the Philosophy of Science\n\nPhilosophers of science have thought of the core questions of the\ndiscipline as these. What is the structure of scientific theories?\nWhat is the logic of confirmation of theories by evidence? What is a\nscientific explanation? What is scientific objectivity and does the\npresence of values in science thwart that objectivity? With regard to\nthe Lande\u2019s metapopulation model and MacArthur and\nWilson\u2019s equilibrium model, we can ask the first three\nquestions. First, we can recognize that these are models that\nabstracted and idealized representations of objects like northern\nspotted owls and fauna on Mangrove islands in Florida. Likewise, we\ncan look at evidence that confirms and disconfirms them. Lande argues\nthat the assumption that northern spotted owls were at a demographic\nequilibrium was supported by the available evidence; Simberloff argued\nthat measures of species turnover rates disconfirmed the equilibrium\nmodel as applied to the fauna on the Mangrove islands. We can argue\nwhether there is sufficient evidence that the assumptions of the\nequilibrium model apply to mountain tops as opposed to islands. One\nmight also argue that the equilibrium model explains the species area\neffect. For those case studies the traditional questions are present\nand philosophical answers to them can be articulated. We can also ask\nwhether Lande\u2019s work was sufficiently objective given that he\ndid the analysis for \u201cpolitical\u201d purposes. However, when we consider SCP, things look very different. Consider place\nprioritization procedures and multi-criteria analysis. The former\nconsiders a set of cells, surrogates, and targets and tries to solve\nto find the smallest set of cells such that every surrogate is met at\ntheir target and find those places subject to a constraint for which\ncoverage exceeds the target. These are optimization problems to be\nsolved by an algorithm via a computer program. The latter considers a\nset of alternatives and using a suite of criteria representing our\nvalues, which determines a non-dominated set of alternatives to inform\ndesign of conservation networks. This brings tools from economics,\npolicymaking, and operations research to help identify solutions to\nproblems. In fact, much of the work that is done in systematic\nconservation planning is done using software packages like the\nfollowing:\n\n\n\nReserve design (Marxan, Zonation, TNC Sites)\n\n\nSpecies distribution modeling (Maxent, DesktopGARP, DIVA-GIS,\nopenModeller, BioMapper),\n\n\nConnectivity (Linkage Mapper, Corridor Designer, CircuitScape,\nConnectivity Analysis Toolkit, Conefor, UNICOR), \n\n\nThreat assessment (GeoCAT, Mirada),\n\n\nPopulation viability analysis (Vortex, BIOMOD, RAMAS),\n\n\nMulti-criteria analysis (EXPERTCHOICE, MultiCSync).\n\n\nThus, with regard to SCP, it would make little sense to ask are these\nprograms, their associated algorithms, and outputs \u201ctrue\u201d?\nAre they confirmed or disconfirmed? How and what do they potentially\nexplain? If we inspect the list of computer programs above, we\nsee many different things that include more than just biology (see\nentry on ecology). The tools include ones\ndrawn not just from the natural sciences, but the social sciences and\nhumanities as well. This raises the question to what extent is\nconservation biology biology? Should it simply be\nconservation science (Kareiva & Marvier 2011)?\n\n\nThere are two rival views as to what the central aims of science are.\nRealists contend it is truth and empiricists say it is empirical\nadequacy (see entry on\n scientific realism).\n Representing the realist\u2019s view, Bas van Fraassen writes,\n\n\nScience aims to give us, in its theories, a literally true story of\nwhat the world is like; and acceptance of a scientific theory involves\nthe belief that it is true. (Fraassen 1980: 8)\n\n\nHowever, van Fraassen is an empiricist (see entry on\n constructive empiricism).\n For the empiricist,\n\n\nScience aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and\nacceptance of a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically\nadequate. (Fraassen 1980: 12)\n\n\nIf SCP is science, then neither realism nor empiricism fit the main\naims of science as articulated by prominent philosophers of science.\nIf so much of conservation biology involves developing algorithms and\ncomputer programs and articulating various conventions, then truth and\nempirical adequacy are relevant for parts of the discipline but\nirrelevant for large swaths. Moreover, if theory structure and\nconfirmation are irrelevant to those swaths because they concern truth\nor empirical adequacy, then the topic of scientific explanation will\nbe irrelevant as well. Since there are few theories and models, then\nthe questions regarding Bayesian versus frequentist methods of\nscientific inference will find less purchase in conservation biology\npractice. Additionally, and maybe most important, socioeconomic values\nare inputs into conservation biology and it simply cannot be done\nwithout them. Or, if it is to be done, it will be the values of a\nsmall set of scientists thus privileging the wrong people (Guha 1998,\nMartin 2017). If SCP is central to conservation biology, much of\nphilosophy of science is irrelevant to conservation\nbiology. Conservation biology increasingly looks like a pragmatic or\ninstrumental endeavor. One possible response would be to develop a\npragmatist or instrumentalist philosophy of science which\nde-emphasizes truth and empirical adequacy (Dewey 1938; Laudan\n1978).\n\nLet\u2019s consider how one might develop a more pragmatic philosophy\nof science. Some philosophers distinguish between epistemic\nand non-epistemic values (Kuhn 1977; McMullin 1982; Longino\n1990, 1996; Lacey 1999; Laudan 2004; Douglas 2009, 2013; Steel\n2010). The former concern truth and related notions like justification\nand explanation whereas the latter concern topics like equality,\nprofit, health, safety, and the like. It can be very difficult to\nclearly distinguish between these two types of values and attempting\nto doing so can quickly take us into ethical and metaethical\nissues. Nevertheless, in the sciences, we have epistemic questions\nlike \u201cDo the theoretical terms of a model refer to existing\nentities?\u201d, \u201cIs this model approximately true or\nempirically accurate?\u201d, \u201cHow accurate are the predictions\nof this model?\u201d Likewise, we have non-epistemic questions like,\n\u201cIs it easy to use this model?\u201d, \u201cIs this hypothesis\naccurate enough for our present purposes?\u201d, \u201cCan this\ntheory provide results in a timely fashion?\u201d, \u201cIs the\nmodel relatively inexpensive to use?\u201d (Elliott and McKaughan,\n2014, 4\u20135). Thus, there seems to be both epistemic and\nnon-epistemic values in science even if the line between them is hard\nto draw. Additionally, we often evaluate our theories and models with\nnon-epistemic considerations As Ronald Giere has argued,\n\u201cScientists use models to represent aspects of the world for\nspecific purposes\u201d (Giere 2004, 742). These scientific\nrepresentations are used for a variety of purposes. These purposes are\nnot only epistemic; some are non-epistemic. Moreover, there are\ntradeoffs between epistemic and non-epistemic values or purposes. For\nexample, we can increase the predictive accuracy of a model by\nincreasing the number of adjustable parameters. However, this also\nincreases the amount of work needed to measure those parameters, and\nit might be too costly. As a result, some philosophers of science\nargue that non-epistemic values can have more importance than\nepistemic values when they promote the aims of scientific inquiry\n(Elliott McKaughan 2014; Hicks 2014; Intemann 2015).\n\n\nOne might object that the fundamental aims of science are epistemic\nrather than non-epistemic or that epistemic values should constrain\nnon-epistemic ones (Douglas 2009; Steel 2010, 2015; Steel and Whyte\n2012). Some still will push back. First, it is clear that practical\naims do outweigh epistemic aims at least\nsometimes. Idealizations that distort the truthfulness of models may\nbe justified by practical considerations such as greater computational\nefficiency or tractability. Second, insofar as non-epistemic values\noutweigh epistemic ones, this can be carefully reflected in\nscientists\u2019 attitudes towards their theories and models. For\nexample, instead of believing that a given model is true, they may\naccept it for predictions with regard to a given domain or for\npolicy-making in very specific scenarios. However, as Daniel Steel\nargues, if scientific inquiry does not prioritize epistemic values,\nthen it is subject to what he calls Ibsen predicaments (after\nHenrik Ibsen\u2019s An Enemy of the People). An Ibsen\npredicament occurs when (a) highly valued objectives of a community\nare linked to some activity, (b) this activity has seriously harmful\neffects, and (c) if those effects became widely known and acted upon,\nthe community would be threatened (Steel 2017, 51).\n\n\nIt appears then that there are epistemic and non-epistemic values in\nthe sciences. Whether the latter should take precedence over the\nformer is the subject of current philosophical\ndiscussions. Conservation biology might very well be such a science where\nnon-epistemic values should take precedence over epistemic\nones. Nevertheless, we are thus left with several questions. First,\nhow do we distinguish between epistemic and non-epistemic values in\nthe sciences? Second, if we can distinguish between them, are\nnon-epistemic values sometimes more important than epistemic ones?\nThird, if non-epistemic values are sometimes more important than\nepistemic ones, does this occur in conservation biology? Can these\nnon-epistemic values include moral and political\nvalues? It is to issues concerning these values that we now turn.\n3. What Are the Aims of Conservation Biology?\n\nIn this section, we will consider three questions. Is conservation\nbiology \u201cvalue-laden\u201d? What values are to be found in\nconservation biology? Should conservation biologists be advocates of\nthese values?\n3.1 Inductive Risk and Value-Ladenness\n\nScientific decision-making involves values. Some however have argued\nthat the values present are merely epistemic values (Laudan 1986). For\nexample, Thomas Kuhn argued that scientific theories are evaluated in\nterms of accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness\n(Kuhn 1977). Moreover, he construed these as values because they are\nso vague as to require interpretation and they are many and thus\nrequire weighting. If they were merely methodological rules, then\nthese would not be problems. Nevertheless, they appear to be\nepistemic. Conservation biology serves as an interesting case because\nit appears that moral and sociopolitical values are to be found at its\ncore (Longino 1990). That is, they are not only epistemic.\n\nLet consider an argument from inductive risk (Douglas 2000; Hempel\n1965; Rudner 1953, and in the context of conservation biology see\nShrader-Frechette & McCoy 1993: Ch. 6). In standard Neyman-Pearson\nhypothesis testing we formulate a null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) and an\nalternate \\(H_1\\) (Gotelli & Ellison 2013). The null states that,\n\u201c\\(C\\) does not have an effect \\(E\\)\u201d. The alternate is\nthe negation, which states that \u201c\\(C\\) has an effect\n\\(E\\)\u201d. Thus there are two relevant probabilities of error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) is true\n\\(H_0\\) is false \n\nAccept \\(H_0\\)\nCorrect\nType II error \n\nReject \\(H_0\\)\nType I error\nCorrect  \n\n\nTable 1: Type I and Type II errors\n\n\nWe can also represent them as, \n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr(\\text{Rejecting } H_0 \\mid H_0 \\text{ is true}) &= \\alpha\\\\\n\\Pr(\\text{Accepting } H_0 \\mid H_0 \\text{ is false}) &= \\beta\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nSuppose we have the following null and alternate hypotheses (Noon and McKelvey 1996, Noon and Blakesley 2006).\n\n\n\\(H_0\\): Logging old growth forest will not reduce northern spotted\nowl populations\n\n\\(H_1\\): Logging old growth forest will reduce northern spotted owl\npopulations\n\n\nThus there are two errors again. We reject \\(H_0\\) and log old growth\nforests will not reduce northern spotted owl populations. We accept\n\\(H_0\\) and logging old growth forests will reduce northern spotted\nowl populations. For mathematical reasons, we cannot minimize both\nType I and Type II errors, and thus we must minimize \\(\\alpha\\) or\n\\(\\beta\\). By custom, scientists attempt to minimize Type I errors;\nthat is,\n\n\nReject \\(H_0\\) if, and only if, \\(\\Pr(\\text{Rejecting } H_0 \\mid H_0\n\\text{ is true}) \\lt 0.05\\)\n\n\nHowever, this requires that we evaluate which would be\nworse\u2014allowing logging though it reduces the owl population or\nnot allowing logging though it would not have reduced them anyway?\nThat is, we have a moral or sociopolitical question. Given habitat\nprotection affects both the owls and the livelihoods of loggers living\nin the Pacific Northwest, this is not merely a technical scientific\nquestion. Some have argued that when environmental harms are at stake,\nwe should minimize Type II errors (Shrader-Frechette & McCoy\n1993). This mode of reasoning is sometimes called the\n\u201cprecautionary principle\u201d (Steel 2015).\n\nNeyman-Pearson statistical hypothesis testing is a very common\nmethodology taught in statistics courses and used by practicing\nbiologists. However, some philosophers and statisticians reject it for\nan alternative, Bayesianism (Howson & Urbach 2006). According to\nBayesianism, we neither accept nor reject hypotheses (though one can\nwork out a notion of acceptance in the framework (see Levi 1974; Maher\n1993)). Rather, we compare the probability of hypothesis with regard\nto some evidence and determine how it affects its probability (see\nentry on\n philosophy of statistics).\n Whether the problem of inductive risk disappears in a Bayesian\ninferential frameworks is an interesting question. Insofar as\ncredences (i.e., subjective degrees of belief) are affected by\nattitudes towards risk, then arguably the problem arises in a\ndifferent guise.\n\nWhether one finds the argument from inductive risk persuasive, it is\nclear that ethical and sociopolitical values are brought into the\nscience itself by various scientists (see entry on\n scientific objectivity).\n Conservation biologists such as Paul Ehrlich, E. O. Wilson, Thomas\nLovejoy, etc. often advocated ethical values as scientists in order to\nraise awareness regarding ecological degradation and its effects on\nspecies including our own (Takacs 1996). Supposing that there are\nepistemic and moral values in conservation biology, what are the\nspecific ones present? One way to taxonomize those values is through\nHelen Longino\u2019s work (Longino 1990) (see entry on\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science).\n She draws a distinction between constitutive and\ncontextual values in science. Constitutive values are those\nthat are essential to the scientific inquiry. For example, if Kuhn is\ncorrect that accuracy, simplicity, and scope are values and they are\nessential to scientific methodology, then these would be constitutive\nvalues. You simply cannot do science without them. Contextual values\nare those that are accidental to science; they come from the personal,\nsocial, and cultural context in which science occurs. It worth noting\nthe epistemic/non-epistemic values distinction is related to but\ndistinct from the constitutive/contextual value distinction. For\nexample, one might argue honesty is a constitutive ethical value of\nscientific inquiry (Pennock 2019). Likewise, one might argue that\ncertain scientists have differing contextual epistemic commitments\n(Segerstr\u00e5le 2000). \n\nSome of these contextual values arise from individuals because of\ntheir own commitments. E. O. Wilson has written a great deal arguing\nthat we should work against anthropogenic species extinction for\nexample (Wilson 1992). Group contextual values include \ncodes of ethics. For example, the Society for Conservation Biology has\na Code of Ethics (see the Other Internet Resources). It includes\nobligations like,\n\n\nActively disseminate information to promote understanding of and\nappreciation for biodiversity and the science of conservation biology.\n\nRecognize that uncertainty is inherent in managing ecosystems and\nspecies and encourage application of the precautionary principle in\nmanagement and policy decisions affecting biodiversity.\n\n\nThough one might argue about specific obligations included in the Code\nof Ethics, generally we the public agrees that one should act with\nintegrity in one\u2019s research and treat non-human animals with\nrespect. Still, there are more controversial societal values that play\na part in conservation biology. Conservation biologist Reed Noss\nwrites,\n\n\nConservation biology has been described throughout its history as\n\u201cvalue-laden\u201d, \u201cmission-oriented\u201d,\n\u201cnormative\u201d, and sometimes in less flattering terms. The\nentire field rests on the value assumption that biodiversity is good\nand ought to be conserved. Human actions that protect and restore\nbiodiversity are good; those that destroy or degrade biodiversity are\nbad. (Noss 2007: 18)\n\n\nRecently, many human lives have been lost to the virus Zaire\nebolavirus in the genus Ebolavirus. To exterminate this\nvirus or the genus one might argue is not morally wrong but morally\npermissible if not obligatory. Noss\u2019 claim is that this is\nmorally wrong, which many would find controversial.\n\nConsider the claim that biodiversity has intrinsic value (see entry on\n environmental ethics).\n Should conservation biologists accept this? Michael Soul\u00e9\nfamously claimed that conservation biology included a variety of\n\u201cnormative postulates\u201d including: diversity of organisms\nis good, ecological complexity is good, evolution is good, and biotic\ndiversity has intrinsic value (Soul\u00e9 1985: 730\u20131). He\nwrites,\n\n\nThis normative postulate is the most fundamental. In emphasizing the\ninherent value of nonhuman life, it distinguishes the dualistic,\nexploitive world view from a more unitary perspective: Species have\nvalue in themselves. a value neither conferred nor revocable, but\nspringing from a species\u2019 long evolutionary heritage and\npotential or even from the mere fact of its existence. (Soul\u00e9\n1985: 731)\n\n\nFirst, what does it mean to say biodiversity has intrinsic value\n(Vucetich, Bruskotter, & Nelson 2015)? Ethicists debate what is\nintrinsic value and what might have it (O\u2019Neill 1992). Some\nargue that intrinsic value is the value something has in virtue of its\nintrinsic properties (Moore 1903) A property is intrinsic roughly if\nit is had by something independent of other objects (see entry on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties).\n However, many properties that make species valuable include ones like\nbeauty and rarity which are arguably extrinsic (Russow 1981). Other\nphilosophers argue that intrinsic value is what we value for its own\nsake (Ewing 1947; Lewis 1989). What is special about intrinsic value\nis how something is valued not the properties of thing so valued. But\nthis is says nothing about what the attitude of valuing is and it\nraises other difficult questions. Some think intrinsic value does not\ndepend on valuers whatsoever. But this appears to assume a strong form\nof moral realism about value, which some metaethicists would deny\n(Blackburn 1993; Gibbard 1992).\n\nSecond, conservation biologists themselves do not agree on the matter.\nHere are representative quotations from conservation biologists on the\nsubject (as quoted in Takacs 1996: 249\u2013252):\n\n\nDavid Ehrenfeld: \u201cFor biological diversity, value is.\nNothing more and nothing less\u2026. Well, I couldn\u2019t prove\nit, I guess. I just believe it.\u201d\n\nPaul Ehrlich: \u201c\u2026 I just can\u2019t have the feeling that\nthe only value they [species] might have is what they might mean to\nus. But you can\u2019t possibly defend that\nscientifically\u201d.\n\nJerry Franklin: \u201cOh, I basically think so, yes. But I\nhaven\u2019t given a whole lot of thought to it\u201d.\n\nDaniel Janzen: \u201cThe word value is anthropocentric\u2026.\nThat\u2019s a contradiction in terms\u201d.\n\nS. J. MacNaughton: \u201cI don\u2019t see how anything can have\nvalue outside of a value that human beings place on it, because value\nis really something uniquely human, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nDavid Pimmentel: \u201c[I]n trying to protect or conserve nature, to\nuse the argument of intrinsic value gets you\u2014well, I don\u2019t\nthink it sells very well\u201d.\n\n\nIf prominent conservation biologists disagree whether biodiversity has\nintrinsic value and what it means to claim it, one might ask how it\ncould be axiomatic in the first place.\n3.2 \u201cNew Conservationism\u201d\n\nRecently, Soul\u00e9\u2019s vision has been called into question by\nthe \u201cnew conservationists\u201d. Peter Kareiva and Michelle\nMarvier have argued for a different foundation for conservation\nbiology or what they call \u201cconservation science\u201d (Kareiva\n& Marvier 2012). They argue that the science needs a new normative\ndirection for a variety of reasons. First, conservation biology has\ntraditionally focused on conserving natural systems for the intrinsic\nvalue of these systems. However, they contend ecological systems can\nonly be successfully managed by embracing the instrumental values\nprovided to humans by these systems. Traditional conservation biology\nthey allege has been at the expense of third world stakeholders and\ncontrary to the interests of women. Second, we live on a planet that\nhas been deeply influenced by humans; so much so that many suggest we\nlive in a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. Human population\nstands at approximately 7 billion and our energy consumption has only\nincreased over time. Humans have deforested, urbanized, polluted,\nextirpated, and overharvested to such a degree that there is no\n\u201cpristine\u201d nature available. \u201cFortress\nconservation\u201d is an out-of-date model of what we should and can\ndo. Moreover, environmental attitudes have changed over time\u2014we\nvalue environmental goods and services less and less in the United\nStates. Thus, we must focus on what people care about and focus on\nmotivating them through these valuations. Third, ecological systems\nare not as fragile as traditional ecology suggests. Rather, they are\nremarkably resilient. Marine systems overcome oil spills, deforested\nareas rebound, bird species dwindle but are rarely eliminated whole\ncloth, and coral reefs can even come back from a hydrogen bomb.\nFourth, we can avoid the tragedy of the commons, which has been a\nmajor theoretical structure for interpreting environmental\ndecision-making. Following the work of Elinor Ostrom, local buy-in can\neliminate the self-interested behavior that leads to such zero-sum\nbehavior (Ostrom 1990). To move forward, they recommend that we\nrecognize conservation can only occur within human-affected\nlandscapes; that we work with corporations and not merely oppose them;\nand that we avoid threatening the human rights of the\ndisenfranchised.\n\nAs one would expect, the new conservationists have been forcefully\nchallenged. For example, David Doak, Victoria Bakker, Bruce Goldstein,\nand Ben Hale have challenged their claims across the board (Doak et\nal. 2014). First, they contend that Kareiva and Marvier focus on human\nwell-being in the most narrow economic terms. Moreover, conservation\nhas never been solely for the \u201cmore-than-human world\u201d but\nhas a rich tradition of managing for human interests as well. Second,\nthere are many relatively undisturbed ecological systems that exist,\nand others have suffered irreversible effects by humans (e.g.,\nanthropogenic global climate change). Third, they suggest that a\nnarrowly anthropocentric approach to conservation has little by way of\nevidence of success. And, traditional approaches have much that\ntestifies in their favor. Additionally, though some conservation\nprojects have displaced indigenous peoples, conservation organizations\nhave been working hard over the last few decades to try to avoid these\nenvironmental injustices. Fourth, they contest the social science that\nclaims environmental attitudes have fundamentally changed and notes\nthat actors are rarely self-motivated and apathetic in the ways the\nnew conservationists suggest. Finally, if one were solely committed to\nhuman well-being with little regard to the moral standing of\necological systems, then we should be investing not in the Nature\nConservancy but Save the Children, Oxfam, and Water for the\nPeople.\n\nConsider a concrete debate between traditional conservation biologists\nand the \u201cnew conservationists.\u201d Recently, some\nconservation biologists have argued that we should make half of the\nEarth\u2019s surface into interconnected protected areas, which they\nclaim would conserve about 85% of our remaining biodiversity (Noss\net. al. 2012; Wuerthener et. al. 2015; Wilson 2016). Currently, only\nabout 15% of the Earth\u2019s terrestrial areas and about 3% of its\noceans are protected. If we consider a variety of studies as to what\npercentage of terrestrial regions should be protected to conserve\nbiodiversity, the median percentage is slightly below 50% (Noss et\nal. 2012, 2). The \u201cHalf-Earth\u201d plan offers three claims:\n(a) habitat loss and degradation are crucially important causes of\nbiodiversity loss, (b) current protected areas are insufficient for\npreventing further loss of biodiversity, and (c) it is morally wrong\nfor our species to cause species\u2019 extinction (Wilson\n2016). Critics argue that \u201cHalf-Earth\u201d has several flaws\nB\u00fcscher et. al. 2017). First, it ignores the most\nserious problems threatening biodiversity \u2013 resource extraction and\nconsumption. Second, if authorities created strict protected areas\n(IUCN Category I or II), then it would have considerable negative\neffects on indigenous people and communities. Third, it is likely that\ncontrol over these reserves will not be given to the indigenous people\nand communities effected, which will only exacerbate their poverty and\nvulnerability. Fourth, when local people are stakeholders in\nconservation programs, both biological conservation and socioeconomic\noutcomes are benefited. Fifth, \u201cHalf-Earth\u201d offers no plan\nfor biodiversity conservation for the other half. They suggest that we\nfocus on the main drivers of biodiversity, which requires rethinking\nfree markets and economic valuation and moving towards regulation,\nredistribution, and viewing natural resources and ecosystems as global\npublic goods. Additionally, they suggest our conservation plans should\nexplicitly address economic inequality (Mikkelson et. al. 2007;\nHolland et al. 2009; Hicks et al., 2016). It is both harmful for\nhumans and leads to biodiversity loss itself. In favor of Half-Earth,\nits defenders have argued in return that though Half-Earth is\nnecessary but insufficient for conserving all of\nEarth\u2019s biodiversity. They also agree that we should reject\nneoliberal economics. However, we should not prioritize equality for\nhumans over non-human species\u2019 equality; \u201cThis will\nrequire setting aside sufficient habitat for other species while\nliving justly and prudently on the remainder\u201d (Cafaro\net. al. 2017, 400). The Half-Earth proposal is very controversial, but\nit is also emblematic of the debates within conservation biology.\n\n\nRegardless, of how we view these contemporary debates, it is clear\nthat there are constitutive and contextual values present in\nconservation biology and any successor discipline moving forward.\nThese include the relatively uncontroversial ones regarding inductive\nrisk and SCB\u2019s Code of Ethics, to those regarding the intrinsic\nvalue of organisms, species, and ecosystems. Furthermore, there are\nvery important questions regarding how these values, non-controversial\nand controversial, should be advocated in the public sphere. If the\nvalues are broadly shared by scientist and non-scientist alike, then\nit appears that advocacy is simply on the public\u2019s behalf.\nHowever, as the values become specific to the scientists themselves,\ntheir advocacy can appear to be in tension with regard to their\nobjectivity as scientists (M.J. Brown 2013; Intemann 2005; Longino\n1990). They appear as \u201ctree huggers\u201d and\n\u201cenvironmentalists\u201d and less than impartial. Moreover, if\ntheir advocacy detracts from their role as scientists, they one might\nworry that this all things considered renders them impotent in\npolicymaking. They seem to be just another \u201ctalking head\u201d\n(Odenbaugh 2003). Thus, conservation biologists must discern how to\nbalance the values at work in their discipline and the greater good to\nwhich they are committed.\n\nSome policy analysts argue that if scientific work is to impact\npolicy, it must be objective (Pielke 2007). However, advocating\npersonal contextual values is alleged to undercut that objectivity\n(Burke & Lauenroth (2009), but see Strong (2008)). If one claims\nthat biodiversity is intrinsically valuable, this value isn\u2019t\nwidely shared, and it cannot be reasonably defended by its proponents,\nthen conservation biologists risk their work being ignored or\ndismissed. On the other hand, if one advocates the conservation of\nbiodiversity on the basis of ecosystem services including carbon\nsequestration, waste decomposition, purification of air and water,\npollination, etc., and loss of these services would negatively impact\nhumans, then this advocacy would be far less controversial (Brussard\n& Tull 2007). In addition, one might reconsider how we think about\nscience itself. We recognize that the enterprise is not\n\u201cvalue-neutral\u201d. Should we regard it as less than\nobjective because of its advocacy (Kincaid, Dupr\u00e9, & Wylie\n2007)? How might we educate the public to think more carefully and\nclearly about the role of values in science?\n4. Conclusion\n\nIn this entry, we have consider three philosophical issues in\nconservation biology. First, we began with the ontology of the\ndiscipline\u2014what is biodiversity? We examined three proposals:\nbiodiversity should be multidimensional, it should be operationalized,\nand that the concept should be eliminated from conservation practice.\nSecond, we considered several different important cases studies in the\nscience\u2014modeling northern spotted owls, the equilibrium model of\nisland biogeography and its impact on the SLOSS debate, and systematic\nconservation planning. What is striking is how traditional\nphilosophical questions appear to disappear or be reoriented in recent\nwork. For example, though there are theories and models, the core\ntheoretical structures are different from other sciences since it\ninvolves various conventions and algorithms. Third, we consider the\naxiological foundations of the discipline. Many conclude that the\nsciences involve considerations of value.
