Critique of political economy\n\n\nLuxemburg\u2019s political stance is grounded in\nher analysis of capital as a set of economic, political and social\nrelations with global scope. She developed her contribution to Marxist\npolitical economy in The Accumulation of Capital: A\nContribution to the Economic Explanation of\nImperialism (1913) and in her Introduction to Political\nEconomy published posthumously in 1925 and based on her lectures\non the same subject at the SPD party school. Her starting position is\nthat the core of a capitalist economy is the extraction of surplus\nvalue and the exploitation of workers as a source of accumulation of\nprofits. As Luxemburg puts it, the distinctive feature of a capitalist\nsystem of production consists in the fact that \u201conly those goods\nare produced which can with certainty be expected to sell, and not\nmerely to sell, but to sell at the customary profit\u201d (Luxemburg\n1913 [AK: 35]). To understand how this is possible, she argues, we need\nto focus on total capital and its continuous transformation\nfrom commodity to money and back to commodity again, in a new cycle of\nspiralling profits (Bellofiore 2009). What is required to maintain the\ncapitalist system, Luxemburg shows, is firstly the ability of\ncapitalists to make profit guaranteed by the reproduction of capitalism\nas a system; secondly, enough demand to meet the offer of new\ncapitalist commodities brought into the market; and thirdly an\nincentive to accumulate based on the prospect of new markets to absorb\nincreasing production.\n\n\nLuxemburg\u2019s study of the dynamic structure of capital\naccumulation begins with a critique of Volume II of Capital.  More\nspecifically, it starts with Marx\u2019s analysis of capitalism as a\n\u201cclosed system\u201d based on a simplified model of relations\nof production between capitalists and workers, which abstracts from\nthe existence of non-capitalist economies. As Marx had put it in\nchapter 24 of Capital, \u201cwe must treat the whole world\nof trade as one nation, and assume that capitalist production is\nestablished everywhere and has taken possession of every branch of\nindustry\u201d (Marx 1887 [1990: 727]). The problem with this\nanalysis, Luxemburg pointed out, consists in a mistaken understanding\nof capital accumulation as a mere question of \u201cthe sources of\nmoney when the real issue is the effective demand, the use made of\ngoods, not the source of money which is paid for them\u201d\n(Luxemburg 1913 [AK: 128]). The closed-system analysis, she\nsuggested, made it difficult to explain how capital could be\nreproduced and valorized in a capitalist society based only on the\nexploitation of workers, and related extraction of surplus value.\n\n\nTo better explain this point it is important to emphasise that one of\nthe core ideas in Marx\u2019s analysis of accumulation was the\nexplanation of the reproduction of capital with reference to the\ndevelopment of technology, competition among capitalists, and their\nthirst for maximizing profit. Luxemburg found that this analysis did\nnot do justice to the distinctive structural constraints of capital\nreproduction. In particular, it did not take account of the necessity\nto access new markets in order to sell consumption goods that\nimpoverished domestic workers could no longer afford. Without the\nguarantee of an ever-expanding market, in a depressed economy with low\ndemand for consumption goods there would be no possibility of capital\nreinvestment and no outlet for accumulated capital stocks. More\nspecifically, under conditions of pauperisation, inequality, and\nongoing exploitation of workers by capitalists, the workers would not\nbe able to generate the demand necessary to absorb the commodities\nproduced by capitalists. The capitalists\u2019 own patterns of\nconsumption would not help to solve the problem of underconsumption\nsince the capitalist class is driven by the imperative to accumulate\ncapital and reinvest in order to keep up with the pressures of market\ncompetition, production, technological modernisation and so on. Given\nthe tension between \u201cthe unlimited expansive capacity of the\nproductive forces\u201d and \u201cthe limited expansive capacity of\nsocial consumption\u201d highlighted in volume 3 of Capital,\nMarx\u2019s own analysis could not explain how the consumption\nnecessary to increase profits could give rise to an\n\u201cenlarged\u201d rather than \u201csimple\u201d reproduction\nof capital. The decisive fact, Luxemburg argued, is that surplus value\n\u201ccannot be realised by sale either to workers or to capitalists,\nbut only if it is sold to such social organisations or strata whose\nown mode of production is not capitalistic\u201d.\n\n\nLuxemburg\u2019s core insight is that the expansion of capital in\nnoncapitalist areas of the world by way of conquest, trade, violence\nor deception provides the kind of outlet that capital needs in order\nto be reproduced as a system. Cheap mass-produced goods that struggle\nto be sold in the markets of developed capitalist states because of\nlow patterns of consumption become available in other areas of the\nworld. They create investment opportunities that displace traditional\nways of organizing economic life, and destroy predominantly\nagricultural forms of production. They also bring in technological\ninnovations and modernizing projects that modify existing relations of\nauthority and reshape forms of class conflict different from the\ncapitalist one. Moreover, thanks to its expansion to non-capitalist\nareas and the disruption of traditional ways of life, there is also\nincreased migration and the possibility of recruiting cheap labour\nforce caused by the disintegration of primitive forms of production\nand non-capitalist ways of life. As Luxemburg pointed out,\n\u201csince capitalist production can develop fully only with\ncomplete access to all territories and climes, it can no more confine\nitself to the natural resources and productive forces of the temperate\nzone than it can manage with white labour alone.  Capital needs other\nraces to exploit territories where the white man cannot work. It must\nbe able to mobilise world labour power without restriction in order to\nutilise all productive forces of the globe\u201d (Luxemburg 1913\n[AK: 343]).\n\n\nSuch an analysis of racism as an integral component of capitalist\nexploitation helped her see the oppression of non-white peoples as an\nongoing feature of the structural replication of the capitalist\nsystem. While Marx had examined colonialism, migration and the\ndisruption of non-capitalist economies with reference only to the\ngenesis of capital (the problem of so-called primitive accumulation),\nLuxemburg criticised him for failing to see how capitalism, also in\nits \u201cfull maturity\u201d depends on non-capitalist strata and\nsocial organisations existing side by side.  Capital, Luxemburg,\nargues, constantly \u201cneeds the means of production and the labour\npower of the whole globe for untrammelled accumulation\u201d\n(Luxemburg 1913 [AK: 346]).\n\n\nThis analysis leads to an understanding of imperialism as the\npolitical expression of competition among capitalists for \u201cwhat\nremains still open of the non-capitalist environment\u201d (Luxemburg\n1913 [AK: 465]). Differently from the expectation of classical\neconomists that the development of commercial relations would bring\npeace among nations, Luxemburg showed how \u201cthe harmony of\ninterests between commercial nations in the East were proclaimed to\nthe sound of gunfire in the Opium Wars\u201d (Luxemburg 1913 [AK:\n427]). And while imperial conquest, displacement and war guarantee the\ndirect subjection of whole parts of the world to the political control\nof more developed capitalist countries, other subtle ways of control\n\u2013 for example, in the form of international loans \u2013 create\npolitical and economic dependency that places the foreign and economic\npolicy of young capitalist states directly under the influence of\ntheir neocolonial masters.  International loans, as she explained,\nhelp dependent territories acquire the resources needed to modernise\nand develop their infrastructure while also financing the export of\ncapital from advanced capitalist countries. However, in a\nfinancialized economy, with investment comes speculation, and when\nhopes of increasing rates of profit are disappointed, debt comes to\nhaunt these vulnerable national economies and losses need to be\nsocialized. This triggers a new, even deeper, crisis and the beginning\nof a new cycle of accumulation accompanied by militarism as a weapon\nin the competitive struggle among nations (Toporowski 2015).\n\n\nLuxemburg\u2019s reading of Marx as well as her analysis of the\naccumulation of capital has attracted several criticisms. It became a\nmatter of controversy already during the Second International when\nauthors such as Bukharin and Lenin, inspired by the Austrian social\ndemocratic economist Rudolph Hilferding\u2019s analysis of finance\ncapital, pointed out the flaws in Luxemburg\u2019s reading of Marx,\nand criticised her for holding a \u201cteleological\u201d view of\ncapitalism in which the whole system is acsribed a purpose much like\nthe component parts of it. This, they further argued, leads to a\nmistaken view of the accumulation of capital (see for a discussion\nBrewer 1990: 62\u201364 and Callinicos 2001: 36\u201342).  As a matter of\nMarxist exegesis, several scholars have also emphasised, that if one\nintegrates the analysis of Capital with Marx\u2019s other\nwritings on colonialism, it is possible to show how\nCapital volume 1 already anticipated a number of critiques\nmade by theorists of the Second International and could be productively\ndeployed to generate a critique of imperalism not too dissimilar from\nLuxemburg\u2019s (Pradella 2013). Moreover, so defenders of Marx point\nout, Luxemburg\u2019s critique is methodologically flawed. While Marx\nintended his scheme of reproduction to be an abstract analysis which\nbrackets away from historical constraints to illustrate the inner\ncontraddictions in the continuous search for profit, Luxemburg\nconflates this philosophical abstraction with a description of\nhistorical reality. Finally , several prominent Marxist economists\n(e.g., Sweezy 1967) criticised her for focusing on the seemingly\nunorthodox premise that \u201cconsumption\u201d rather than the\nrealisation of surplus value is the main concern of a capitalist sytem\nthus conflating the question of \u201cwhere does demand come from to\nto realise surplus value\u201d with the question \u201cwhere does the\nmoney come from to monetise profits\u201d (see Bellofiore 2009 for a\ndiscussion and response).\n\n\nNotwithstanding these criticisms, the originality of Luxemburg\u2019s\ncontribution to an analysis of the role of finance in the accumulation\nof capital, and her emphasis on the monetary character of the\ncapitalist economy cannot be denied. She was one of the first authors\nto contribute to what some have called the \u201ccritical school of\nfinance\u201d which pioneered an analysis of financial crisis as\nrelatively independent from industrial crisis, anticipating later\ndebates on the relation between the rate of savings and the motivation\nto invest as discussed in the works of John Maynard Keynes, Michal\nKalecki and Hyman Minsky (Robinson 2013). Her remarks on the role of\nthe credit and debit system are crucial to understand the\nunderdevelopment and ongoing reproduction of relations of dependency\nbetween core and peripheral capitalist countries. Luxemburg\u2019s\nanalysis of the constant expansion of capital into non-capitalist\neconomies is still crucial to understand contemporary globalisation\npractices, the interconnectedness between global financial crisis and\nthe pressures of international migration, and to explain how global\ndispossession and exploitation work together to advance the interests\nof a global capitalist class.\n",
