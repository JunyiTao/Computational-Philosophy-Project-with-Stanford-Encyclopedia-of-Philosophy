    "main_text": "Arguments in Favor of the Representational Theory of Sensory Qualities || Awareness of sensory qualities\n3.6 Awareness of sensory qualities\n\nThe discussion in this past section and in the next focus on the\nnature of sensory qualities themselves. According to the\nrepresentationalist, the qualities are not mental; the corresponding\nmental property of a sensory state is that of representing\nthe relevant quality. Of course, it is sensory states and experiences\nthemselves that interest philosophers of mind, and some critics of\nrepresentationalism will protest that merely representing a quality\ncannot be all there is to having the qualitative character that needs\nexplaining; we shall return to that complaint in section 4.2\nbelow.\n\nAs yet we have said nothing about what it is to be aware of a\nquality.\n\nIf a sensory quality is an intentional object of a mental state, then\npresumably the state\u2019s owner is aware of the quality in whatever\nway a person is aware of the intentional contents of her/his mental\nstates generally, including those of nonsensory propositional\nattitudes. The general issue is problematic and is much discussed in\nthe \u201cself-knowledge\u201d literature. There are various\noptions: higher-order representation; self-representation; attentional\nmodulation; \u201cacquaintance\u201d of some sort more intimate than\nany of the foregoing; or the automatic replication of a first-order\nstate\u2019s content in any other state directed upon the first. In\nany case, however, the problems of awareness of content are already\nwith us, and do not afflict the representational theory of sensory\nqualities in particular.\n",
