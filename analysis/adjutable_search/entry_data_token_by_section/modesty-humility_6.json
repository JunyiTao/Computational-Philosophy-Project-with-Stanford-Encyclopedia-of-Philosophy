    "main_text": "Doxastic Accounts || Strong Accuracy\n2.2 Strong Accuracy\n\n\nStrong accuracy accounts not only deny that modesty is compatible\nwith ignorance, but defend the idea that modesty is, at its heart,\nabout having certain true beliefs. On some views, humility does involve\nunderestimation, but only as a means to accurate self-assessment. Foot\n(1978/2002, 9) and Slote (1983, 61\u201362) both note that humility is a\ncorrective to a general human tendency to think too highly of\nourselves. No evidence is offered in support of this empirical claim,\nbut its truth will require considering how self-evaluation works in\ndifferent contexts, skill levels, cultures, and temperaments.\n\n\nMany strong accuracy accounts are called \u2018egalitarian\u2019 or\n\u2018equitable\u2019 views. These accounts make modesty a matter of\na particular kind of correct belief. Drawing on Kantian ideas about\nthe equal moral status of all rational agents, these views root\nmodesty in a the accurate recognition of people\u2019s equal moral\nstatus. So for Ben-Ze\u2019ev (1993) modesty is a matter of knowledge\nof the equal moral worth of everyone and accurately seeing that\nparticular good qualities do not affect this worth. Hare (1996, 240)\ndistinguishes one\u2019s \u201cmoral worth as a person\u201d (a\nstatic and invariable value) from one\u2019s \u201cworth as a moral\nperson\u201d (a value that can be affected by good qualities) and\nsees modesty as rooted in a recognition of the former.\n\n\nSince modesty is a matter of knowing the equal moral worth of all\npeople, defenders of this view sometimes deny that modesty is a\ndependent virtue since one can have the relevant knowledge while\nlacking any good qualities oneself (see Ben-Ze\u2019ev 1993). They\nalso sometimes deny that immoral people, or people who deny the equal\nmoral worth of everyone, can ever be modest at all; see Nuyen (1998,\n107) and Statman (1992, 434).\n\n\nAnother type of strong accuracy view appeals to different scales of\nevaluation. This type of view is defended by Brennan (2007), who\nattributes it to Adam Smith (see Theory of Moral Sentiments 6.3.22\u201323; it is also considered and rejected by Sidgwick 1907/1981,\n334\u20135). On this view, modest people evaluate themselves relative to an\nideal but evaluate others relative to practical norms. So modest people\nrightly think of themselves as not very good (compared to an ideal like\na saint), and can rightly think of other people as being good (relative\nto how good most people actually are). Having two scales allows the\nmodest person to make accurate assessments of themselves and others,\n albeit with regard to different evaluative standards. (See also\n asymmetry accounts\n below).\n\n\nA third type of strong accuracy account requires accuracy about both\nour own good qualities and how those qualities are received by others.\nMcMullin (2010) defends this type of account, requiring that the modest\nperson acknowledge both the legitimacy of public standards and that\none\u2019s worth is not fully defined by them. Though she also\n requires tendencies to foster the welfare of others (as in\n kindness accounts\n below), these are rooted in an\naccurate understanding of oneself and one\u2019s place in the social\nworld.\n\n\nStrong accuracy accounts, by explaining modesty and humility by\nappeal to knowledge, not only deny that modesty requires ignorance or\nfalse belief, but make modesty incompatible with it.\u00a0\n",
