    "main_text": "Empathy, Moral Philosophy, and Moral Psychology\n5. Empathy, Moral Philosophy, and Moral Psychology\n\nMoral philosophers have always been concerned with moral psychology\nand with articulating an agent\u2019s motivational structure in order\nto explicate the importance of morality for a human life. After all,\nmoral judgments supposedly make demands on an agent\u2019s will and\nare supposed to provide us with reasons and motivations for acting in\na certain manner. Yet moral judgments, at least in the manner in which\nwe conceive of them in modern times, are also regarded to be based on\nnormative standards that, in contrast to mere conventional norms, have\nuniversal scope and are valid independent of the features of specific\nsocial practices that agents are embedded in. One only needs to think\nof statements such as \u201ccruelty to innocent children or slavery\nis morally wrong,\u201d which we view as applying also to social\npractices where the attitude of its population seem to condone such\nactions. Moral judgements thus seem to address us from the perspective\nof the moral stance where we leave behind the perspective of self-love\nand do not conceive of each other either as friends or foes (see Hume\n1987, 75) or as belonging to the in\u2013group or out\u2013group,\nbut where we view each other all to be equal part of a moral\ncommunity. Finally, and relatedly, in order to view morality as\nsomething that is possible for human beings we also seem to require\nthat our motivations based on or associated with moral reasons have a\nself-less character. Given to charity for merely selfish reasons, for\nexample, seems to clearly diminish its moral worth and implicitly deny\nthe universal character of a moral demand. Philosophically explicating\nthe importance of morality for human life then has to do the\nfollowing: It has to explain how it is that we humans as a matter of\nfact do care about morality thusly conceived, it has to address the\nphilosophically even more pertinent question of why it is that we\nshould care about morality or why it is that we should regard\njudgments issued from the perspective of the moral stance to have\nnormative authority over us; and it has to allow us to understand how\nit is that we can act self-lessly in a manner that correspond to the\ndemands made on us from the moral stance. Answering all of these\nquestions however necessitates at one point to explain how our moral\ninterests are related to our psychological constitution as human\nbeings and how moral demands can be understood as being appropriately\naddressed to agents who are psychologically structured in that manner.\n\n\nPrima facie, the difficulty of this enterprise consists in squaring a\nrealistic account of human psychology with the universal scope and\nintersubjective validity of moral judgments, since human motivation\nand psychological mechanisms seem to be always situational, local, and\nof rather limited scope. Moreover, as evolutionary psychologists tell\nus in\u2013group bias seems to be a universal trait of human\npsychology. One of the most promising attempts to solve this problem\nis certainly due to the tradition of eighteenth century moral\nphilosophy associated with the names of David Hume and Adam Smith who\ntried to address all of the above philosophical desiderata by pointing\nto the central role that our empathic and sympathetic capacities have\nfor constituting us as social and moral agents and for providing us\nwith the psychological capacities to make and to respond to moral\njudgments. While philosophers in the Kantian tradition, who favor\nreason over sentiments, have generally been skeptical about this\nproposal, more recently the claim that empathy is central for morality\nand a flourishing human life has again been the topic of an intense\nand controversial debate. On the one hand, empathy has been hailed by\nresearchers from a wide range of disciplines and also by some public\nfigures, President Obama most prominently among them. Slote (2010)\nchampions empathy as the sole foundation of moral judgment, de Waal\n(2006) conceives of it as the unique evolutionary building block of\nmorality, Rifkin (2009) regards it even as a force whose cultivation\nhas unique revolutionary powers to transform a world in crisis, and\nBaron-Cohen (2011, 194) views it as a \u201cuniversal solvent\u201d\nin that \u201cany problem immersed in empathy becomes soluble.\u201d\nOn the other hand, such empathy enthusiasm has encountered penetrating\ncriticism by Prinz (2011 a,b) and Bloom (2016), who emphasize its dark\nside, that is, its tendency to fall prey to so\u2013called\n\u201chere and now\u201d biases. The following subsections will\naddress these issues by surveying the relevant empirical research on\nthe question whether empathy motivates us in a self-less manner, the\nquestion of whether empathy is inherently biased and partial to the\nin-group, and it will discuss how we might think of the normative\ncharacter of moral judgments in light of our empathic capacities.(For\na survey of other relevant issues from social psychology, specifically\nsocial neuroscience, consult also Decety and Lamm 2006; Decety and\nIckes 2009, and Decety 20012.
