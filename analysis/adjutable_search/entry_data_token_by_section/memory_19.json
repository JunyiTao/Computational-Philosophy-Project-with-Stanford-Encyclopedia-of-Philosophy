    "main_text": "Accuracy || Factivity\n6.2 Factivity\n\nTo impose this additional requirement is to claim that memory is\nfactive, in the sense that genuine memories are necessarily\ntrue, that is, that apparent memories that are not true are\nmerely apparent. In philosophy, the view that memory is\nfactive has been common. The standard arguments for the factivity of\nmemory are linguistic, appealing to the apparent incoherence of\nasserting both that one remembers an event and that the event did not\noccur (Bernecker 2017; cf.\nMoore\u2019s paradox).\n Assessing these arguments is beyond the scope of this entry, but note\nthat they are controversial even among those who give linguistic\narguments a great deal of weight (De Brigard 2017; Hazlett 2010).\nAmong naturalists, who often give linguistic arguments less weight,\nthey are more controversial still. From a naturalistic point of view,\nthe goal of a theory of remembering ought to be to describe the\nprocess of remembering itself, regardless of whether we are\nintuitively inclined to classify its results as genuine or merely\napparent memories. If the same process may be responsible both for\nproducing true memories and for producing false memories, then an\nadequate theory of remembering will not require that genuine memories\nare always true\u2014in the terms introduced in\nsection 2, the relevant natural kind may include both\ntrue and false memories, regardless of whether our ordinary linguistic\npractice permits us to group them together.\n\nIn psychology, the view that memory is factive has been much less\ncommon. This is not very surprising, given that much psychological\nresearch on remembering focuses on unsuccessful remembering:\nunderstanding how unsuccessful remembering occurs provides important\ninsights into the mechanisms responsible for successful remembering,\njust as understanding how perceptual illusions and hallucinations\noccur provides important insights into the mechanisms response for\nsuccessful perception. What is more surprising is that psychologists\nhave sometimes gone too far in the opposite direction, assuming that,\nbecause remembering is constructive, it is bound to be false (Ost\n& Costall 2002). This is in effect to treat memory as\ncounterfactive. The distinction between authenticity and\ntruth enables us to see that constructive, generative remembering need\nnot be characterized by falsity. The generative character of\nremembering does, however, point to the need for a more sophisticated\ncriterion of truth (S. Campbell 2014). While the fact that remembering\nis generative does not imply that memories are bound to be outright\nfalse, it does suggest that they are frequently false in some\nrespects. This, in turn, suggests that remembering need not be fully\naccurate in order to be fully adequate, thus pointing towards a need\nfor a criterion that acknowledges that truth in memory comes in\ndegrees.\n",
