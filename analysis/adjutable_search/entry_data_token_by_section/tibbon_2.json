    "main_text": "Translations\n3. Translations\n\n\nThe primary occupation of Samuel Ibn Tibbon was translator. This is\nwhat he was trained to be by his father. His most famous translation\nis the Guide of the Perplexed.  But he also translated other\nworks by Maimonides, and produced the first Hebrew versions of\nAristotle and Averroes. A brief description of each of the\ntranslations will be given here.\n\n\n1. Maimonides, Commentary on the Mishnah, Avot\n\nThe first major translation of Maimonides by Ibn Tibbon was the\ncommentary on Avot, which was completed, according to the manuscript,\nin 1202. Ibn Tibbon translated the commentary proper together with\nMaimonides\u2019 introduction, entitled \u201cEight Chapters.\u201d\nThe preface in particular, consisting of an introduction to and\nadaptation of Aristotelian ethics, would become the standard\nintroduction to philosophical ethics in Hebrew throughout the later\nMiddle Ages.\n\n\n2. Maimonides, \u201cTreatise on Resurrection\u201d\n\nIt seems that the \u201cTreatise on Resurrection\u201d was\ntranslated into Hebrew during the resurrection controversy\n(1202\u20131204), when Maimonides was accused of denying this religious\ndogma. Ibn Tibbon translated it, and, it seems, sent it to Toledo,\nwhere it was retranslated into Arabic and translated afresh by Judah\nal-Harizi into a more fluid and readable Hebrew style.\n\n\n3. Maimonides, Guide of the Perplexed\n\nIbn Tibbon began to work on this translation already in the 1190s,\ncorresponded with Maimonides regarding problems of translation and\ninterpretation, produced a first edition in 1204, and a revised version,\nwith glossary (Perush ha-Millot ha-Zarot), in 1213. The\ntranslation itself generally circulated with the glossary, together\nwith Ibn Tibbon\u2019s marginal annotations, an introduction on\ntranslation, and other study aids and ad hoc discussions.\n\n\n4. Maimonides, \u201cLetter on Translation\u201d\n\nWhile working on the translation of the Guide, Ibn Tibbon\ncorresponded with Maimonides, but only one letter by Maimonides\nsurvives. This letter is a complex text, which includes a brief\nintroduction, discussion of problems in translation, a description of\nhis busy life in Fustat, and recommendations for philosophical\nreading.  The letter was originally written in Arabic, but survives\nonly in several Hebrew translations, one of which was rendered by Ibn\nTibbon himself. This translation also includes Ibn Tibbon\u2019s own\n(often critical) remarks on Maimonides\u2019 suggested renderings of\ndifficult Arabic terms.\n\n\n5. Aristotle, Meteorology\n\nIbn Tibbon\u2019s translation of the Meteorology was completed,\naccording to a manuscript colophon, in 1210, while returning by boat\nfrom Alexandria. In the preface, he discusses the problems of\ntranslating this work: the subject was difficult, the Arabic\ntranslation obscure, and the manuscripts corrupt. Thus he consulted\nmanuscripts in Barcelona and Toledo in order to help reconstruct the\noriginal. He also examined the commentaries on it by Alexander of\nAphrodisias, Avicenna, and Averroes\u2014for textual witnesses and to\nhelp understand the text. In some cases, he incorporated translations\nfrom the commentators into the translation itself. Ibn Tibbon\u2019s\npreface to the translation includes the beginnings of a lexicon,\nperhaps part of a larger project, which was never completed or was\nincorporated into his larger glossary (to be discussed below).\n\n\nWhy did Ibn Tibbon translate the Meteorology before any other\nwork by Aristotle? It seems that he did this in response to a remark made\nby Maimonides in Guide 2:30\u2014that Meteorology\nis the key to understanding the \u201caccount of the beginning\u201d\nin Genesis, chapter 1.\n\n\n6. Averroes and \u2018Abd Allah, \u201cThree Treatises on\nConjunction\u201d\n\nThe translation of three short treatises on conjunction with the\nactive intellect by Averroes and Averroes\u2019 son \u2018Abd Allah\nwas also a pioneering project. They were the first works of Averroes\nrendered into Hebrew, before any of the commentaries on Aristotle. Ibn\nTibbon translated them and attached them to his commentary on\nEcclesiastes. He did this, he maintained, because Averroes and Solomon\nwere aiming to do precisely the same thing: to defend the doctrine of\nconjunction against skeptics who denied that it was possible.\n\n\nThese translations, therefore, like the Meteorology, had\nstrong exegetical significance. But they were read in their own right\nas well. They circulated independently of the commentary on\nEcclesiastes, and became standard textbooks in the discussion of\nimmortality. Thus, for example, they were included in Gershom b.\nSolomon\u2019s encyclopedic work Sha\u2018ar ha-Shamayim,\nwere commented on by Gersonides, and were incorporated into Hanokh b.\nSolomon al-Konstantini\u2019s Marot Elohim. A composite\nLatin version, based on the Hebrew, circulated under the title De\nanimae beatitudine.\n\n\n7. Maimonides, \u201cLetter to Yemen\u201d \n\nThe last known translation by Ibn Tibbon is Maimonides\u2019\n\u201cLetter to Yemen.\u201d This text he seems to have acquired\nwhile in Egypt; and he translated it into Hebrew circa 1214. Why he\ntranslated this text is not known. But it seems that it did not\ncirculate widely. Thus already in the 1230s Abraham ibn Hasdai found\nit necessary to produce a fresh translation of the work, since he\ncould not find a copy of the rendering by his predecessor.\n\n\n8. Other translations\n\nIbn Tibbon incorporated translations and summaries of Arabic texts\ninto his original writings as well. This is true in the glossary\nattached to the Guide (Perush ha-Millot ha-Zarot),\nhis commentary on Ecclesiastes, and Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu\nha-Mayim. Three of the most important examples are the\nfollowing:\n\n\n8.1 Al-Farabi, Short Summary of Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge and\nAristotle\u2019s Categories\n\nThe first entry in Ibn Tibbon\u2019s glossary is the definition of\nthe ten categories and five predicables. Most of the text presented\nthere is a word-for-word translation from al-Farabi.\n\n\n8.2 Al-Bitruji, Principles of Astronomy\n\nIn the glossary, commentary on Ecclesiastes, and Ma\u2019amar\nYiqqawu ha-Mayim, Ibn Tibbon presents a brief summary of\nal-Bitruji\u2019s astronomy; these were the first appearances of\nBitruji\u2019s novel theories in Hebrew. In the following generation,\nthe entire text of al-Bitruji was translated by Samuel\u2019s son\nMoses.\n\n\n8.3 Avicenna, Kitab al-Shifa\u2019, Meteorology\n\nIn the third chapter of Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim, Ibn\nTibbon presents a partial translation of a section from Avicenna\u2019s\nShifa\u2019 on mountain formation. The theory of\nAvicenna\u2014that erosion is prevented by the mixture of mud with\nfatty oils\u2014contributed to Ibn Tibbon\u2019s discussion there of\neternity of the world and the possibility of spontaneous\ngeneration.\n\n\n9. Spurious and doubtful translations\n\nMany other translations are attributed to Ibn Tibbon in manuscripts,\nmanuscript catalogues, and later sources. Most are clearly spurious;\nbut two are worth mentioning. Isaac Abarbanel refers to a translation\nby Ibn Tibbon of Maimonides\u2019 introduction to chapter ten of\nMishnah Sanhedrin, but this translation does not survive. An anonymous\ntranslation of the text, published by Kupfer, is clearly not his work.\nThe second is a translation of \u2018Ali b. Ridwan\u2019s commentary on\nGalen\u2019s Ars parva. According to the colophon, this\ntranslation was completed by Ibn Tibbon in B\u00e9ziers in 1199. If\nthis attribution were correct, it would contribute important\ninformation to Ibn Tibbon\u2019s biography. It would also establish the\nvery early existence of an Arabic medical text in Hebrew. The\ntranslation itself, however, uses terms such as nirdaf for\nsynonym that were not part of Ibn Tibbon\u2019s translation lexicon. If it\nis his work it was done much later or revised by a later hand\n(cf. Freudenthal and Fontaine).\n",
