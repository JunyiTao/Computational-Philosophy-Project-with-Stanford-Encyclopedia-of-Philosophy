    "main_text": "Pluralism and Rational Choice || Accepting Incomparability\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe battle lines in the debate between pluralism and monism are not\nalways clear. This entry has outlined some of them, and discussed some\nof the main arguments. Pluralists need to be clear about whether they\nare foundational or non-foundational pluralists. Monists must defend\ntheir claim that there really is a unitary value. Much of the debate\nbetween pluralists and monists has focussed on the issue of whether\nthe complexity of moral choice implies that values really are\nplural\u2014a pattern emerges in which the monist claims to be able\nto explain the appearance of plurality away, and the pluralist insists\nthat the appearance reflects a pluralist reality. Finally, pluralists\nmust explain how comparisons between values are made, or defend the\nconsequence that incommensurability is widespread.\n",
