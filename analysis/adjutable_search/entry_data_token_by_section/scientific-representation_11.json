    "main_text": "The Inferential Conception || Deflationary Inferentialism\n5.2 Deflationary Inferentialism\n\nSu\u00e1rez argues that we should adopt a \u201cdeflationary or\nminimalist attitude and strategy\u201d (2004: 770) when addressing\nthe problem of scientific representation. Two different notions of\ndeflationism are in operation in his account. The first is to abandon\nthe aim of seeking necessary and sufficient conditions; necessary\nconditions will be good enough (2004: 771). The second notion is that\nwe should seek \u201cno deeper features to representation other than\nits surface features\u201d (2004:771) or \u201cplatitudes\u201d\n(Su\u00e1rez and Sol\u00e9 2006: 40), and that we should deny that\nan analysis of a concept \u201cis the kind of analysis that will shed\nexplanatory light on our use of the concept\u201d (Su\u00e1rez\n2015: 39). Su\u00e1rez intends his account of scientific\nrepresentation to be deflationary in both senses, and dubs it\n\u201cinferentialism\u201d. Letting \\(A\\) stand for the model and\n\\(B\\) for the target, he offers the following analysis:\n\nInferentialism: \u201c\\(A\\) represents \\(B\\) only if (i) the\nrepresentational force of \\(A\\) points towards \\(B\\), and (ii) \\(A\\)\nallows competent and informed agents to draw specific inferences\nregarding \\(B\\)\u201d (2004: 773).\n\nThe first condition addresses the Requirement of Directionality and\nensures that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) indeed enter into a representational\nrelationship. On might worry that explaining representation in terms\nof representational force sheds little light on the matter as long as\nno analysis of representational force is offered. But Su\u00e1rez\nresists attempts to explicate representational force in terms of a\nstronger relation, like denotation or reference, on grounds that this\nwould violate deflationism (2015: 41). The second condition is in fact\njust the Surrogative Reasoning Condition, now taken as a necessary\ncondition on scientific representation. Contessa (2007: 61) points out\nthat it remains mysterious how these inferences are generated. An\nappeal to further analysis can, again, be blocked by appeal to\ndeflationism because any attempt to explicate how inferences are drawn\nwould go beyond \u201csurface features\u201d. So the tenability of\nInferentialism in effect depends on the tenability of\ndeflationism about scientific representation. Su\u00e1rez (2015)\ndefends deflationism by drawing analogies with three different\ndeflationary theories about truth, Ramsey\u2019s\n\u201credundancy\u201d theory, Wright\u2019s \u201cabstract\nminimalism\u201d and Horwich\u2019s \u201cuse theory\u201d (for\nmore information of these theories see the SEP entry on\n the deflationary theory of truth).\n An alternative defence builds on Brandom\u2019s inferentialism in\nthe philosophy of language (1994, 2000), a line of argument that is\ndeveloped by de Donato Rodr\u00edguez and Zamora Bonilla (2009) and\nKuorikoski and Lehtinen (2009).\n\nInferentialism provides a neat explanation of the possibility\nof misrepresentation because the inferences drawn about a target need\nnot be true (Su\u00e1rez 2004: 776). In as far as one accepts\nrepresentational force as a cogent concept, targetless models are\ndealt with successfully because representational force (unlike\ndenotation) does not require the existence of a target (2004: 772).\nInferentialism repudiates the Representational Demarcation Problem and\naims to offer an account of representation that also works in other\ndomains such as painting (2004: 777). The account is ontologically\nnon-committal because anything that has an internal structure that\nallows an agent to draw inferences can be a representation. Relatedly,\nsince the account is supposed to apply to a wide variety of entities\nincluding equations and mathematical structures, the account implies\nthat mathematics is successfully applied in the sciences, but in\nkeeping with the spirit of deflationism no explanation is offered\nabout how this is possible. The account does not directly address the\nProblem of Style.\n",
