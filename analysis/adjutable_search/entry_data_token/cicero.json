Cicero\u2019s Life and Times\n\nThere are a number of good studies of Cicero\u2019s life (e.g.\nFuhrmann 1992, Rawson 1994, Tempest 2011); some background knowledge\nis salient to an understanding of his philosophical outlook. As\nalready mentioned, Cicero lived through a turbulent historical period.\nUnder the strains of empire, the Roman republican system of government\nhad fractured, and was eventually to prove unsustainable. Cicero was\nboth witness to and participant in some of the events that hastened\nthe collapse of republican government and that ushered in, within\nfifteen years or so of his death, the rule of Augustus, first of the\nRoman emperors.\n\nCicero rose to the highest political office in the republic \u2013\nthe consulship \u2013 in 63 BCE. His period as consul was both the\nhigh-water mark of his political career and a fateful turning-point.\nWhile consul, he put down the conspiracy against the republic led by\nCatiline. But his actions led to his being exiled in 58; and, while he\nwas restored to Rome the following year through the influence of\nPompey, he could do little other than contemplate with horror the\ndeterioration of relations between Caesar and Pompey that led to civil\nwar and the ascendancy of Caesar to the dictatorship. Caesar\u2019s\nassassination in 44 brought only brief respite. Cicero himself was put\nto death on Mark Antony\u2019s orders in 43.\n2. Philosophy and Roman Society\n\nAs a staunch republican himself, Cicero frequently despaired of the\nstate of the republic. Writing philosophy provided both consolation\nand a resource that, at least in more hopeful moments, he believed\ncould help ameliorate the political crisis. One of the things that\nmakes Cicero an interesting philosophical figure is his conviction\nthat philosophy has the potential to change lives and make societies\nbetter. This belief in philosophy\u2019s practical purpose explains\nwhy much, though by no means all, of Cicero\u2019s philosophical\nproduction has a broadly ethical or political orientation.\n\nThe social and political backdrop is important in another way too. One\nof Cicero\u2019s purposes in writing philosophy is to bring the best\nof the Greek philosophical inheritance to wider Roman attention. That\ndoes not, however, mean that his works are simple philosophical\nmanuals to be absorbed uncritically by their readership. A striking\nfeature of Cicero\u2019s philosophical output is that it takes\nseriously and critically the question of the relation between abstract\nideas, on the one hand, and the culture and tradition of particular\nsocieties (most saliently, for him, Rome), on the other.\n\nIndeed, Cicero treats this relation as bringing with it a set of\ndistinctly philosophical questions about, for example, the normative\nweight to be assigned to the deliverances of rational theology as\nagainst traditional religious practice (see section 7.3 below), or to\nthe precepts of an abstract ethical theory as against the\ntheory\u2019s liveability in a concrete society (section 7.2 below).\nHis discussions of the leading philosophical theories of his day tend\nto be used not for the purpose of firm advocacy of one particular set\nof doctrines or another, but to give his readers the tools to think\nthrough positions for themselves. Cicero\u2019s project of\ndisseminating philosophy has the aim of inducing what he saw as the\nproperly philosophical approach, one that is critical and\nopen-minded.\n3. Dialogue and the Sceptical Stance\n\nHis philosophical compositions bear out this approach in two important\nand connected ways. Firstly, they are by and large written in dialogue\nform (see Gorman 2005, Schofield 2008). His adoption of the form in\npart reflects his admiration for Plato, whom he considered the\ngreatest of all philosophers. Now Cicero\u2019s relation to Plato is\na complex one (see Long 1995b, H\u00f6sle 2008, Bishop 2019 ch. 2),\nand his use of the dialogue form differed from Plato\u2019s,\nmanifesting itself principally in opposed set speeches rather than\nrapid back-and-forth exchanges, though the latter are not completely\nabsent from Cicero\u2019s work (and long speeches are common enough\nin Plato). We find Cicero also invoking the (now lost) dialogues of\nAristotle and of the early Platonist philosopher Heraclides of Pontus\nas influences on him. Still, his favouring of dialogue over straight\ntreatise shares the Platonic motive of engaging readers in active\nphilosophical enquiry.\n\nThe majority of Cicero\u2019s philosophical writings feature a\nspeaker or series of speakers setting out the views held on a core\ntopic (for example, the nature of the gods, or the best way to live)\nby various philosophical schools, with a critique of those views\nmounted after each exposition, often by Cicero himself. Thus, in terms\nof their structure, his works lend themselves not to decisive\nacceptance or rejection of a particular view, but to a setting out of\nall sides of an argument so readers can make their own assessment.\n\nThis feature reflects, in turn, Cicero\u2019s allegiance to Academic\nscepticism. Now the extent and nature of this allegiance is a matter\nof debate (see Glucker 1988, G\u00f6rler 1995, Thorsrud 2012, Brittain\n2016, Wynne 2018) but what matters for present purposes is that the\nsceptical stance takes it as a mistake to believe that certainty is\npossible. The most one can do is form a judgement that some particular\nposition is more or less plausible than another, such a judgement\nitself being revisable in the light of further evidence or\nargument.\n\nThe truly philosophical approach is thus one that refuses to take any\nphilosophical view as settled \u2013 including this very one (see\nsection 7.1 below). Cicero thereby sets himself against the approach\nof the contemporary \u2018dogmatic\u2019 schools \u2013 in\nparticular, Epicureanism and Stoicism \u2013 where dogmatism refers\nnot to positions that are unargued for, but to doctrines regarded by\ntheir advocates as settled truth. Cicero\u2019s stance is not one\nthat pits itself primarily against specific doctrines of these schools\n\u2013 the sceptic is entitled to adopt any view as plausible.\nRather, what he opposes is a conception of intellectual endeavour as\ncapable of arriving at certainty. The best philosophy is one that\nfosters critical enquiry; and the nature and role of philosophy must,\nby the same token, itself be in the critical spotlight.\n4. Philosophy and Oratory\n\nCicero\u2019s main philosophical production can be divided into two\nchronological periods. The first, from around 54\u201351 BCE, sees\nthe writing of his two main works of political philosophy, the\nRepublic and the Laws (the latter apparently\nunfinished), each loosely based on a Platonic archetype, together with\nhis great work on the nature and role of oratory, On the\nOrator. The second period, during which he composed the greater\npart of his philosophical oeuvre, occurred in an astonishing two-year\nburst of creativity towards the end of his life, in 45 and 44.\nAlthough Cicero\u2019s writings on oratory (he composed several works\non the topic) will not be discussed here, they should not be regarded\nas entirely distinct from his philosophical writings. That is because\nthe relation between philosophy and oratory was of central importance\nto him. While this might sound arcane to a modern ear, what it\nencapsulated for Cicero was the vital question of how philosophy is\nbest communicated.\n\nIn the Gorgias, Plato had Socrates mount a passionate attack\non rhetoric, by contrast with philosophy, as concerned with mere\npersuasion rather than truth. For Cicero, as probably the supreme\norator of his day, matters could not be that simple. The use of speech\nto manipulate others for self-serving ends could not, of course, be\ncondoned. But the idea that pure reasoning, divorced from\ncommunicative skill, was sufficient to win people round to philosophy\nstruck Cicero as, if anything, even more dangerously misguided. The\nresources of oratory must be recruited to the vital enterprise of\ndisseminating philosophy to new audiences. Cicero often shows himself\nacutely conscious of criticism that a practical Roman should so much\nas attempt to write philosophy. By writing it in a way that was not\nalienating to its potential audience, he could aspire to draw his\ncritics in despite themselves.\n5. The First Period: Philosophical Politics\n5.1 The Republic and Laws\n\nIt is perhaps no accident that Cicero\u2019s first two major\nphilosophical works should be in political philosophy, given both the\ncrisis faced by the republican system of government and the need to\nproduce work in a field that would be regarded as suitable for a Roman\nstatesman. But the Republic and Laws (in Latin\nDe Re Publica and De Legibus respectively) are in at\nleast one respect radical nonetheless: together with On the\nOrator, they introduce the dialogue form into Latin literature.\nAnd notwithstanding the influence of Plato, the two works can lay\nclaim to being among the most original parts of Cicero\u2019s\nphilosophy, since each deals to a substantial extent with the\ngovernment and institutions of a state of which Plato could have had\nno inkling, namely Rome.\n\nBoth works are intensely Roman. The Republic takes as the\nbest kind of state one that, to a large extent, consists in the\ntraditional structures of the Roman republic. The Laws\nconsiders the sort of laws that will best maintain or restore those\nstructures. To this extent, they challenge the idea, one that Cicero\nsaw reflected in the utopianism of Plato\u2019s Republic,\nthat political philosophy should proceed in isolation from\nconsideration of actual political structures and societies. Yet, in\nways that make their overall message far from straightforward, both\nare deeply influenced by abstract theory as well, and by questions of\nhow theory, history and practical politics interact.\n5.2 The Republic\n\nIn the Republic, a work which unfortunately has not come down\nto us complete (none of its six books survive whole, with large\nportions missing especially from the last four), Cicero stakes out his\nposition early with an attack on philosophers who argue that one\nshould refrain from public affairs \u2013 he means principally\nEpicureans. The Stoics, in offering a more activist model, present the\nalternative view. The Stoic philosopher Panaetius, together with the\nGreek historian Polybius, is named in the main body of the dialogue as\nhaving discussed political matters with one of the work\u2019s\nprincipal speakers, Scipio (1.34); and the influence of Stoic\npolitical thinking is evident in the idea that humans share with gods\ndominion not just of the place in which they happen to live, but of\nthe Earth and indeed the whole universe (1.19). Yet this cosmopolitan\noutlook in turn creates tension with the idea, also prominent in the\ndialogue, of the specialness of Rome, and raises the question of\nwhether Roman exceptionalism can sit comfortably with a view of human\nbeings as citizens of the world.\n\nIt is noteworthy that, even before embarking on a discussion of the\nnature of the state, Cicero is explicit in his preface (1.12) about\nthe need to justify participation in public affairs, a stance that\nunderlines his view that theories of good government are all very well\nbut may be idle unless one makes the case that engaging in the public\narena is the right thing to do. Yet, having commended the participant\nover the theoretician, Cicero goes on to say that he will now appeal\nto those who are moved by the authority of philosophers, and declares\nthat in their discussions of government such philosophers have\nthemselves discharged a public office.\n\nThe debate about the role of philosophy is reflected within the main\nbody of the dialogue as well, and here it becomes if anything clearer\nthat Cicero\u2019s purpose is not to play down philosophy but to play\nup the practically oriented way of doing political philosophy that he\nconsiders appropriate to the subject. At the same time, this enables\nhim to present his writing on the topic as genuine progress over his\nGreek predecessors. It may, then, come as a surprise to find, in a\nwork of supposedly practical orientation, that prior to Scipio\u2019s\nmain exposition in Book 1 of the different types of political\nconstitution, Cicero depicts a rather lengthy discussion of a\ncosmological event: the recent apparent sighting of a \u2018second\nsun\u2019 in the sky (1.15).\n\nScipio, even though he will take the lead role in the discussion of\npolitical theory, fulsomely praises the more abstract kinds of study\ndirected at the celestial realm (1.26\u201328); but he is persuaded\nby Laelius, another participant, that it is of greater importance now\nto address terrestrial issues, particularly regarding the best form of\ngovernment (1.30\u201334). The debate that Cicero lays out about the\ninvestigation of the human versus the divine realm makes the case for\nthe study of both as having value, and intriguingly leaves open the\nquestion of the relation between the two: Scipio speaks of how the\nEarth pales into insignificance beside the heavens, and asserts that\nthere is a universal natural law that has authority over any civil\nlaw, so that what has ultimate moral weight is the decree of the wise\nperson who understands the natural law, rather than that of the Roman\npeople (1.27). Similar principles are laid down at 3.33, anticipating\nthe fuller discussion in the Laws. These are pronouncements\nwith a strongly Stoic flavour; and when another participant, Philus,\nspeaks of the Stoic notion that gods and humans share the whole\nuniverse as their homeland, he suggests that for that reason cosmology\nmight be relevant to politics in any case (1.19).\n\nBy the time that we turn to Scipio\u2019s exposition of the various\nforms of government, it can be seen that Cicero has used the\nflexibility of the dramatic dialogue to prime his reader to examine\nthe topic with a critical eye. Scipio\u2019s focus on Rome is a\nresponse to the lack of practical awareness that he (or his author)\nsees infecting Greek models. But if Stoic universalism is correct,\nsuch focus on a particular concrete system seems itself to be headed\nin the wrong direction. And if cosmology is more important than\npolitics, yet too important for politics to ignore, then an exposition\nthat sticks to the human realm \u2013 as Scipio\u2019s, as far as we\ncan tell, largely does \u2013 is missing something. Cicero thus\ninvites us, in the midst of a work on political theory, to consider\nhow small the human (and within that the Roman) domain is, a thought\nreinforced in some complex ways in the dialogue\u2019s concluding\nDream of Scipio, perhaps the most famous excerpt in all of\nCicero\u2019s philosophy (its survival owed to its coming down to us\nas part of a separate manuscript tradition). In thus giving the work\nas a whole structural integrity (despite its, for us, truncated\ncondition), Cicero\u2019s framing challenges the reader to maintain a\ncritical perspective on the doing of political philosophy itself.\n5.3 The Laws\n\nIn Republic 5, Scipio had affirmed that the political leader\nrequires knowledge of justice and of the laws and will have studied\ntheir foundations. The discussion of natural law in Laws 1\noffers an account of those foundations. The purpose of such an account\nis to set the parameters within which more concrete laws must fall and\nbe judged. The natural law is god\u2019s law; it is also what human\nbeings who have perfected their reason would follow. Law is to be\nidentified with right reason (1.23), or more specifically with right\nreason in the realm of what is commanded or forbidden (1.33, 1.42).\nThis, then, is a normative account: it tells us what law, properly\nspeaking, is; and that may be very different from the actual laws that\nparticular states have enacted.\n\nGiven the normative character of Cicero\u2019s enquiry, it is not\ndifficult to see why law should be identified with right reason.\nRationality, after all, is itself a normative concept. Not every piece\nof thinking counts as rational, and rationality can be exercised\nimperfectly and so, at least in principle, perfectly. If one reasons\ncorrectly about the relevant matters in the case of what is just and\nunjust, then it seems fair to conclude that one will enunciate\nstandards against which, for example, actual laws will be required to\nmeasure up. Law in the normative sense is \u2018what distinguishes\njust things from unjust\u2019 (2.13).\n\nIt is not as obvious why the concept of nature, or the natural, looms\nlarge in Cicero\u2019s account of law. One of its main purposes is,\nagain, to stress that he is conducting a normative enquiry. We are, he\nsays, \u2018born for justice\u2019, and what is right is a matter\nnot of opinion but of nature (1.28). Here Cicero draws upon a\ntradition, already going back at least as far as Plato, in which\nnature stands in contrast with convention. What is merely a matter of\nconvention or opinion is not the same as what is really \u2013\n\u2018by nature\u2019 \u2013 the case. Thus the fact that a certain\n(human-made) law states that something is right or wrong does not mean\nthat its pronouncements are correct.\n\nWhat is this nature that is thus contrasted with matters of opinion or\nconvention? It is, in the first instance, human nature, as witnessed\nby Cicero\u2019s statement that \u2018we\u2019 are born for\njustice. We all belong to the same species, and to that extent are all\nalike (1.29), in particular in our possession of reason, which\ndistinguishes us from other creatures (1.30). This explains the sense\nof mutual fellowship and union between human beings (1.28) and means\nthat we are formed by nature to share justice and impart it to all\n(1.33). This does not mean that we necessarily do this. Nature is\nitself a normative concept, so humans can fail to live up to their own\nnature, corrupted by the effects of bad habit and opinion (1.29,\n1.33). Nonetheless, Cicero argues, if one considers the endowments\nthat humans share, one will conclude that justice is the natural human\ncondition.\n\nBut nature also refers, compatibly, to the nature of the universe as a\nwhole, since on the Stoic theory that Cicero draws upon (a theory set\nout more fully in Book 2 of Cicero\u2019s On the Nature of the\nGods, see esp. 2.73\u201390), the universe \u2013 \u2018all of\nnature\u2019, as Cicero puts it \u2013 is governed by god (1.21).\nGod in turn exercises governing power through the activity of right\nreason, which we humans, at least in our best condition, share with\ngod (1.23). Reason is thus natural, in that it underlies the workings\nof the universe; and since we possess it too, as the divine element in\nus, in expressing our human nature it expresses our kinship with the\ngods as well. Hence Cicero can refer in Book 2 of the Laws to\nthe \u2018true and original law\u2019 as identified with the right\nreason of god (2.10).\n\nCicero\u2019s thinking seems to be that to regard laws as no more\nthan human artefacts \u2013 that is, as not based in nature \u2013\nis to concede that reward and punishment are the only motivations for\nobedience. But then it will be the rewards and punishments, not the\njustice or injustice of the act in question, that will have normative\nforce. But if that is so, then if one calculates correctly that, say,\ngreater utility will arise from breaking than obeying a law, it seems\nthat one has no reason to obey it. What is needed, rather, is a\nconception of justice as something to be sought, as Cicero puts it,\n\u2018for its own sake\u2019 (1.48). That is, we must think of what\nis just as having an inherent normative force, to be pursued because\nit is just. And that means, for Cicero, that justice must be based in\nnature and not simply a matter of human convention.\n\nWhether or not we find this stance convincing, there is a specific\ntheory of justice that Cicero appears to have in mind as the object of\nhis critique: the Epicurean theory. Epicurus regarded justice as\nprecisely a matter of social agreements concluded with the aim of\nmaximizing utility. One should further note that Cicero\u2019s friend\nAtticus is, along with Cicero\u2019s brother Quintus, one of\nCicero\u2019s two main interlocutors in the dialogue, and that\nAtticus is an adherent of Epicureanism. His presence seems to\nemphasize that there is an alternative point of view that is not being\ngiven the opportunity to defend itself. Strikingly, Cicero does not\neven say that he thinks the Epicurean theory is wrong; rather, he bids\nthe Epicureans abstain from all matters of government, which they\nneither know about nor have wished to know about (1.39). It is true\nthat the Epicureans, unlike the Stoics, generally maintained a\nquietist outlook and believed that by and large one should not be\npolitically active. But they did have a specific theory of justice. So\nCicero seems a little high-handed in excluding them from a\nconversation featuring that as one of its principal topics.\n\nEpicureans are not the only ones whose views Cicero seems intent on\nmarginalizing in this context. Remarkably, he asks the adherents of\nthe New (that is, sceptical) Academy to \u2018be silent\u2019, since\ntheir habit of attacking any doctrinal view will cause\n\u2018confusion\u2019 and result in the ruin of Cicero\u2019s\n\u2018elegantly arranged edifice\u2019 (1.39). We have indeed just\nbeen reminded that Cicero himself is a follower of the sceptical\nAcademy, with Atticus\u2019 ironical comment that Cicero is of course\nsomeone who does not follow his own judgement in debate but the\nauthority of others (1.36). Cicero replies that he indeed does not\nalways accept the authority of others but that he is here trying to\nestablish a foundation for states and cities (1.37).\n\nShould we take Cicero at face value here? Although one can understand\nthat having to deal with opposing views may make it more difficult to\nestablish the kind of basis for systems of law and justice that he has\nin mind, that could surely apply to any philosophical thesis and any\nsort of opposition. One might even suppose that attacking an edifice,\nhowever elegantly constructed, might lead to a stronger edifice being\nbuilt. Cicero in fact says that he would like to appease the sceptics\nand does not dare drive them off (1.39). So why does Cicero attempt\njust here to stifle debate? Why, in particular, does he draw attention\nto the fact that that is what he is doing? He need not have mentioned\nthe sceptics, nor for that matter the Epicureans. He need not have\nchosen Atticus as a participant whom he could then ask not to dispute\nhis basic premise.\n\nCicero clearly expects his readers to notice these moves. One might\nsay that to announce loudly that one is closing down debate is itself\nto initiate a debate. Cicero thus uses the notion of uniformity of\noutlook both to illustrate and critique a crucial feature of the\ntheory he is advocating. The idea of natural law is precisely the idea\nthat there is a universal set of normative principles of equal\napplicability in all contexts. If that idea is correct, then there is\nno room for divergence of opinion about what justice is. At the same\ntime, Cicero\u2019s dismissal of the Epicurean and sceptical\nviewpoints reminds us that, in the real world as opposed to the ideal\none of perfected reason, there are competing and critical opinions,\nand that the universalist theory is itself a product of a particular\nphilosophical school (Stoicism).\n\nOn the one hand, then, we have a vision of uniformity, representing a\nkind of ideal endpoint in which all is organized and measured in\naccordance with the same basic principles. On the other, we have\nconcrete and divergent voices that embody a range of perspectives and\nshow where we are now and perhaps \u2013 though the voices may change\n\u2013 where we will be at any specific historical moment: at some\ndistance from an undisputed endpoint. In the very process of apparent\nsuppression of dissent, Cicero uses the resources of the dialogue form\nto draw readers into critical participation in his enquiry.\n6. The Second Period: An Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n\nCicero\u2019s second, and most intense, period of philosophical\nproduction occurs during the last few years of his life, a period that\nsaw the dictatorship and then assassination of Julius Caesar. The\nlatter event caused Cicero\u2019s political stock to rise briefly\nbut, in the end, brought only futile hope of the restoration of\nrepublican government. The political situation, combined with personal\ntragedy \u2013 the death of his daughter Tullia in childbirth \u2013\nresulted in a remarkable bout of creativity during which Cicero\nproduced substantial works on a wide range of philosophical themes.\nHis ambition, as he puts it in his preface to On the Nature of the\nGods (1.7), was to compose nothing less than a comprehensive\ntreatment covering \u2018the whole of philosophy\u2019 \u2013 a\nveritable encyclopedia of the subject.\n\nFor the purposes of this entry, a more selective approach is adopted.\nThree late dialogues will be highlighted below, but the late period\nalso saw the composition of two works likely to be relatively familiar\nto non-specialists: On Duties (De Officiis),\nconcerning practical conduct, and Tusculan Disputations, on\nthe theory of the emotions, together with a trio of works on mainly\nStoic themes: On Fate (De Fato), On\nDivination (De Divinatione) and Stoic Paradoxes\n(Paradoxa Stoicorum), as well as a pair on specific issues in\nethics: On Old Age (De Senectute) and On\nFriendship (De Amicitia). In what follows, further works\nfrom the period on each of three central topics \u2013 epistemology,\nethical theory and theology \u2013 are discussed, in order to offer a\nrepresentative illustration of the distinctiveness of Cicero\u2019s\napproach as an Academic sceptic and writer of philosophical\ndialogues.\n6.1 Epistemology\n\nAlthough it has come down to us in a rather misshapen state,\ncontaining portions of two quite different editions of the work,\nOn Academic Scepticism (in Latin Academica) cannot\nbe passed over, since it presents an account of the epistemological\nviewpoint of the sceptical Academy and so in effect serves as a\ndefence of the method that Cicero employs in much of his philosophical\nwriting. At the same time, Cicero does not present a one-sided\npicture. In the segment sometimes known (after its leading character)\nas the Lucullus, critique of the New, or sceptical, Academy\nis mounted, with Cicero responding on behalf of the sceptic.\n\nAgainst a position that denies that certainty is attainable, Lucullus\nargues that intellectual enquiry, which aims at proof, will be\nhamstrung, since proof requires certainty (2.26). Moreover, the\nsceptic\u2019s refusal to allow that there can be\n\u2018cataleptic\u2019 impressions \u2013 the Stoic technical term\nfor impressions that can be grasped with certainty \u2013 will\nsubject the sceptic to the charge of inconsistency (cf. 2.44): the\nsceptic holds that nothing can be grasped with certainty, but surely\nthe claim that \u2018nothing can be grasped with certainty\u2019\nmust itself be graspable with certainty, or else the sceptic position\nlacks firm foundation.\n\nIf the sceptics have their own counterpart of a criterion of truth, in\nterms of the notion of plausibility, they must surely regard that\nnotion as beyond dispute if it is to play its allotted role (2.29).\nGiven the importance of correctly identifying the proper basis for\none\u2019s decisions and actions, it cannot for the sceptic be merely\nplausible, but must be certain, that plausibility is the right\ncriterion. Sceptics are thus impaled on a dilemma: their system\nundermines itself by being either inconsistent (if \u2018nothing can\nbe grasped\u2019 is graspable) or ineffectual (if it is not\ngraspable).\n\nLucullus continues to take aim at the notion of plausibility that\nfeatures as the sceptics\u2019 criterion for determining what we\naccept and do (2.32); but he approaches it in a way that might seem to\nbeg the question, asking how the sceptic can maintain a criterion of\ntruth and falsehood if truth and falsehood are indistinguishable\n(2.33). It seems as if the sceptic could reply that they do not in\nfact have such a criterion. They do not, unlike their dogmatic\nopponents, claim to pronounce one thing true, another false. What they\ncan do \u2013 what, if they are right, is the most one can do \u2013\nis identify one thing as plausible, another as implausible.\n\nLucullus has an interesting riposte to this, which involves\nquestioning the intelligibility of being able to determine what is\nplausible and what is not without a criterion for determining what is\ntrue and what is not. He points out that in rejecting the cataleptic\nimpression, the sceptic does not allow that there are impressions\ndistinctively marked out as truth-bearing. But if so, it follows that\nthere is no difference between true and false, in the sense that there\nis nothing about a given impression that will mark it out as true\nrather than false. So, says Lucullus, \u2018there will be no\ncriterion\u2019 (2.34). In other words, without a means of\ndetermining which is true, no impression will be more deserving of\ncredence than any other.\n\nMoreover, the notion of plausibility is, logically, tied to the notion\nof truth: what is plausible is what \u2018resembles truth\u2019, in\nLatin veri simile, the phrase Cicero uses as an alternative\nfor probabile to represent the concept of plausibility. If\nsomething is plausible, then it is likely (though not certain) to be\ntrue. But the sceptics by their own admission have no criterion for\ndetermining what is true. Hence, they have no way of judging something\nas likely to be true, since that presupposes a standard of truth\nagainst which the purported plausibility would be judged.\n\nCicero responds by sketching a distinction, made by the sceptical\nphilosopher Clitomachus, of two ways in which one might withhold\nassent: by refraining (a) from \u2018completely\u2019 assenting to\nanything, and (b) from approving or disapproving. The wise sceptic\nwill never completely assent to any impression but will\n\u2018approve\u2019 those that are plausible and\n\u2018disapprove\u2019 those that are not. One will then be able to\nact on the basis of those impressions one approves, without having\nentirely assented to them (2.104).\n\nThe distinction has an air of sophistry about it, but it corresponds\nreasonably well to the way we actually make decisions. Take a simple\ncase of my deciding whether to drink the tap water in my glass. It\nlooks and smells healthy, there seems nothing to suggest otherwise.\nNonetheless it might always be the case that it is unhealthy. I\n\u2018approve\u2019 the impression that it is healthy and drink the\nwater, while accepting that it cannot, strictly speaking, be certain\nbut at most plausible that the water is healthy; hence I do not\n\u2018completely\u2019 assent to the impression. If it turns out to\nbe unhealthy, my original impression was not mistaken, because I only\ntook it to be plausible, rather than true, that the water was healthy,\nwhich is consistent with its being unhealthy. Thus the wise sceptic\ncan act on the basis of mere plausibility while in an intelligible\nsense not getting things wrong.\n\nCicero suggests that even the Stoic sage will follow many things on\nthe basis of plausibility, if life is to be possible at all (2.99);\nand his point, I take it, is supposed to apply not just in case it\nturns out that there are no cataleptic impressions, but even in those\n(presumably frequent) situations where such impressions, should they\nexist, are not present. The wise still have to live. Indeed, if one\nincludes the crucial refinement made by the leading sceptical\nphilosopher Carneades as part of the plausibility criterion \u2013\nnamely that the impression must be \u2018unimpeded\u2019 (2.104)\n\u2013 then we seem to have a way of addressing Lucullus\u2019 point\nthat to have a notion of plausibility, or being likely to be true,\ndepends on one\u2019s having a prior notion of truth as such.\n\nWhat does \u2018unimpeded\u2019 mean? Cicero spoke at 2.99 in terms\nof there being nothing that presents itself in opposition to the\nplausibility of the impression. Take the example of the water again.\nIt looks healthy in my glass, it comes from a generally reliable\nsource (my tap), there is nothing to indicate that it is not healthy\n\u2013 nothing, therefore, \u2018impeding\u2019, or presenting\nitself in opposition to, the plausibility of the impression that it is\nhealthy. Say, further, that I then hear on the radio a news report\nthat the water supply in my area has been contaminated. At this point\nthere is something opposing \u2013 undercutting, one might say\n\u2013 the plausibility of the impression that the water is healthy\nand I would not therefore drink it.\n\nHow does this tell against Lucullus\u2019 criticism? It suggests\nthat, rather than plausibility being dependent on truth, we might\nbuild a notion of truth upon that of unimpeded plausibility. Take the\nwater case once again. What would it mean to be able to identify as\ntrue the impression that \u2018this water is healthy\u2019? It could\nbe argued that its truth would be a matter of there being nothing to\noppose the impression of plausibility \u2013 no\n\u2018defeaters\u2019, as it were. Say, then, that I turn on the\nradio and hear no news reports pertaining to my water; but being the\nultra-cautious type I send the water to a lab for testing. It turns\nout that the sample is laden with harmful microbes. There is thus\nsomething opposing the plausibility of the impression that the water\nis healthy.\n\nIt seems as if one could move towards a notion of truth by utilising\nthe condition that there is nothing opposing an initial impression\nthat things are a certain way \u2013 in the water case, no news\nreport, no adverse lab results, and so forth. This would still be a\nnotion of truth as something possessed fallibly. But the sceptic can\nnow speak of identifying some things as true (rather than as simply\nplausible) and others as the contrary (2.111). Carneades at any rate\nis not trying to provide an equivalent of the Stoic notion of\ninfallible truth-possession. His \u2018unimpeded\u2019 condition is\na refinement designed to give a criterion of reasonable action in the\nabsence of such a notion. What one can do, using Carneades\u2019\nmethod, is start with the impression of something\u2019s being the\ncase and approach, but never reach, a position of certainty. It is a\nquestion of increasing the likelihood of correctness, not eliminating\ncompletely the possibility of error.\n\nIf so, then Cicero can likewise reject Lucullus\u2019 assertion that\nthe sceptic must (inconsistently) hold their own theory of\nplausibility as certain. He reiterates Carneades\u2019 view that the\ntheory, like any other claim, could at most have the status of\nplausibility by the very terms of the theory (2.110). Seen in the\nlight of the \u2018unimpeded\u2019 condition, plausibility now looks\na more robust notion than it may have appeared, and so the resting of\none\u2019s whole procedure for decision and action on such a basis\nlooks correspondingly less fragile, though of course it is still\nfallible. But scepticism deserves to be rejected not if it cannot\nclaim certainty for its guiding principle, but if it fails to apply to\nitself the same standards of critical scrutiny that it does\nelsewhere.\n\nIn perhaps Cicero\u2019s most technical work, he rarely allows us to\nlose sight of what purpose the technicality serves. Lucullus had ended\nhis speech in critique of scepticism by addressing Cicero himself,\nmaking what looks like a light-hearted jest that Cicero supports a\nphilosophy that keeps things in the dark despite his having brought\nthe most deeply hidden matters to light (2.62). He refers to the\nuncovering by Cicero of Catiline\u2019s conspiracy, a plot whose\nnature and significance remain a matter of debate, but whose thwarting\nCicero refers to often and takes to represent his having more or less\nsingle-handedly saved the republic from catastrophe.\n\nThe punning contrast of obscurity and illumination that Lucullus\nemploys thus has a serious point, reminding us that what turns on the\nsometimes abstruse epistemology is the vital practical question of\nwhether the sceptical viewpoint allows there to be a proper basis for\ndecision and action, especially on the political stage. Roman \u2013\nand of course not just Roman \u2013 politicians, including Cicero\nhimself and those whom he might hope to win over to the sceptical\ncause, must at times take life-and-death decisions.\n\nOne of the most controversial aspects of Cicero\u2019s actions\nagainst Catiline was the execution without trial of five of the\nalleged co-conspirators, an act that ultimately led to Cicero\u2019s\nexile. Is mere likelihood sufficient to justify the weight of\none\u2019s actions in such cases? Should not certainty be the only\nproper basis? And is a criterion of plausibility even intelligible\nwithout a notion of certainty? Whatever we think of Cicero\u2019s\nanswers to these questions, he leaves us in no doubt about why the\nquestions matter. Even at its most abstract, philosophy\u2019s\nrelation to the concrete and practical lies at the heart of his\nenterprise.\n6.2 Ethical Theory\n\nCicero\u2019s principal work on ethical theory, On Ends\nor On Moral Ends (in Latin De Finibus), offers\nperhaps the most vivid example of his use of the sceptical method to\nengage critically with questions about the nature of philosophy\nitself. The title abbreviates a longer Latin title (De Finibus\nBonorum et Malorum) whose meaning \u2013 literally, On Ends\nof Goods and Evils \u2013 raises puzzles of its own (on which\nsee Allen 2014), but refers, to simplify a little, to the question of\nwhat are the highest goods, the attainment of which will bring about a\nhappy human life. Cicero considers three leading ethical theories of\nhis day: Epicureanism, which proposes that pleasure is the highest\ngood; Stoicism, which holds that virtue is not just the highest but\nthe only good; and the theory of the so-called Old Academy, which,\nwhile including goods other than virtue within its conception of the\nsupreme good, ranks virtue higher than the rest. The structure of the\nwork is once again dialogical: for each theory, Cicero puts into the\nmouth of a proponent an exposition of that theory, followed by a\ncritical response delivered by Cicero himself.\n\nCicero allows himself a head start on the exposition of Epicurean\nhedonism by its proponent Torquatus with an initial, critical outline\nof the theory in Book 1. At 1.23\u201324 he appeals to the behaviour\nof two of Torquatus\u2019 ancestors, both stern military men who\ntreated their sons harshly (execution for cowardice and banishment for\ntaking bribes, respectively), behaviour which in Cicero\u2019s view\ncan only be explained by their having put the wider public interest\nahead of their own pleasure, contrary to Epicurean prescription.\n\nCicero chooses examples that, in combining military with family, evoke\ncore ancient Roman values. Torquatus then defends his ancestors\u2019\nbehaviour in terms compatible with Epicurean theory. Focusing in\nparticular on the first Torquatus, he argues that he acted to uphold\nhis authority at a time of war, and therefore to enhance his own\nsecurity and so, ultimately, pleasure. More striking than the details\nof Torquatus\u2019 explanation is that he feels the need to give it.\nWhy could he not have said that his ancestors were misguided and that\nit took later generations to see the Epicurean light? Torquatus says\nexplicitly that he has no reason to fear that he cannot\n\u2018accommodate\u2019 his ancestors to the Epicurean view (1.34).\nThat he rises to Cicero\u2019s challenge in this way indicates that\nancestral behaviour has normative force for him: his ancestors must be\nread as acting from (what he considers) the correct motives.\n\nInterestingly, it appears that Torquatus\u2019 own father was an\nEpicurean, whom Torquatus evidently admired. He reports with\nenthusiasm his father\u2019s rebuttal of a Stoic argument against\nhedonism (1.39); and, though this is not said explicitly, perhaps was\ninfluenced by his father in adopting Epicureanism himself. Cicero thus\nslyly reinforces the sense that ancestral piety is an ineliminable\npart of the value system that Torquatus shares. He has induced\nTorquatus to agree that it would be a problem for the\nvalidity of Epicurean ethics if it did not sit comfortably with the\nnorms of Roman culture. The reader is thus encouraged to reflect on\nwhether, and if so how, the abstract and general features of an\nethical theory are to fit with outlooks and practices which, at least\nin part, carry normative weight precisely because they represent\nadherence to a particular tradition: a strategy that Cicero further\ndeploys in his more lengthy critique of Epicurean ethics in Book 2\n(see Inwood 1990).\n\nHowever difficult it might be for Torquatus himself, it seems open to\nan Epicurean to respond that they have no obligation to simply accept\nRoman values as authoritative. Epicurean theory is professedly a\nradical one that sees most humans as having been corrupted by false\nvalues. What, then, should we, as non-Roman readers, make of\nCicero\u2019s discussion? Even if we accepted that he demonstrates an\nincompatibility between Roman and Epicurean values, it is not clear\nthat this should have any hold on us. We are surely both able and\nentitled to assess the Epicurean case on its own merits. On the other\nhand, we are no less the inheritors of cultural assumptions and\noutlooks than the Romans, even if ours are different, and even if the\n\u2018we\u2019 implied are a great and diverse plurality.\nDisentangling a thing\u2019s \u2018own merits\u2019 from the values\nwe bring to an encounter with it is neither a simple nor perhaps a\nviable task.\n\nThis is not of course to say that our perspectives cannot be changed\nby such philosophical encounters. Ethical theory, particularly of the\nprofessedly radical sort that many ancient philosophers propounded,\nwould hardly have a point if that were the case; and Cicero\u2019s\nproject of communicating such theories would be equally unintelligible\nin that light. But coming to a theory from outside of any perspective\nis unintelligible. What Cicero\u2019s holding up of\nEpicurean ethics against the canvas of Roman tradition conveys is a\npoint about how ethical theory in particular must conform, not so much\nto specific values and traditions, as to certain basic elements of\nwhat makes us human, without which it would be hard to discern how an\nethical theory could have purchase on us at all: above all, perhaps,\nour status as social creatures shaped by our relation to specific\nhistories and traditions.\n\nWhen it comes to Stoic theory, as laid out next by its spokesman Cato\nthe Younger, things look more promising. Cato was historically the\narch-defender of the traditional values of the Roman republic, while\nStoicism, with its emphasis on the supremacy of virtue and the value\nof political participation, seems on the face of it to conform to the\nRoman way much more readily than Epicureanism does. Nonetheless, the\nstringency of Stoic theory, which holds that virtue is the only good\nthing, and vice the only bad thing, and takes virtue not to admit of\ndegrees \u2013 without complete virtue one is not virtuous at all\n\u2013 allows Cicero to mount his critique.\n\nHe invites us to consider whether the Stoics have a theory which, in\nthe terms they express it, can be proclaimed in those contexts that\ndefine the sphere of public life for a Roman: courts, assembly, Senate\nhouse, and battlefield. A lawyer, observes Cicero, could not credibly\nconclude the case for the defence by declaring that the punishments of\nexile and confiscation were not evils, but merely to be\n\u2018rejected\u2019 (the Stoic technical term for aversion toward\nthings that nonetheless cannot affect one\u2019s happiness); nor\ncould an orator announce, with Hannibal at the gates, that captivity,\nenslavement, and death were no evils (4.22). Moreover, the Senate\nwould not be able to speak of Scipio Africanus\u2019 triumph as\nhaving been won by his valour, since he did not meet the standards of\nperfection required, in Stoic terms, for virtue (4.22).\n\nThis sort of objection seems especially damaging for the Stoics, with\ntheir emphasis on agency and public participation. In effect Cicero\nargues that the Stoics can have their integrity, or their theory, but\nnot both. They cannot express their doctrines about virtue in public\ncontexts without incurring ridicule or incomprehension. What they are\nleft with, according to Cicero, is hypocrisy: the use of ordinary\nlanguage in public, their own language in their writings (4.22).\n\nWhether or not Cicero is fair to the detail of Stoic and Epicurean\nethics, his aim, as exemplified by the dialogical structure, is to\nprovoke debate. In particular, his readers are invited to consider to\nwhat extent ethical theory must be answerable to social reality. Is\nnot an ethical theory that cannot be lived consistently thereby flawed\nas a theory? In keeping with this question, Cicero moves next to a\ntheory that seems on the face of it rather more congenial to lived\nexperience, with an exposition by his interlocutor Piso of the ethics\nof the Old Academy, broadly in line with what we now think of as\nAristotelian ethics.\n\nCrucially, this theory recognises a plurality of goods. Piso holds\nthat virtue is sufficient for happiness but that there are also bodily\ngoods such as health and freedom from pain, the possession of which,\nwhen added to virtue, will render the subject not just happy, as\nvirtue on its own does, but \u2018supremely happy\u2019 (5.71).\nCicero wonders whether treating such things as goods will not simply\nmean adopting the view of Aristotle\u2019s distinguished successor\nTheophrastus who, while providing a good deal of the resources for\nPiso\u2019s account (5.12), also acts as something of an outlier for\nhaving claimed that no life could be happy if caught up in pain or\nmisfortune (5.77).\n\nCicero asks Piso to consider whether, even if one were to allow that a\nsingle misfortune might not affect the happiness of the virtuous, an\naccumulation of them would: could someone wracked by pain, disease,\nand other misfortunes plausibly be thought of as happy, let alone\nhappiest? (5.84). Shrewdly turning against him the Aristotelian method\nof canvassing the views of both the many and the wise, to which Piso\nhad appealed at 5.63 in support of his view of the supremacy of\nvirtue, Cicero declares that ordinary folk would deny, and experts be\nunsure, that someone being tortured could be happy (5.85). Piso\nresponds by giving a more worked-out \u2018lexical\u2019 account of\nthe relation between virtue and the other goods, so as to underpin his\nview that virtue suffices for a happy (even if not for the happiest)\nlife: the smallest amount of excellence of character is ranked ahead\nof all bodily goods; and no foul-but-pleasant action is better than\nany honourable-but-painful one (5.93). Virtue can thus be equated with\nhappiness, while happiness can be enhanced through the addition of\nother goods (5.95).\n\nOne might think, however, that this theoretical tightening comes at a\ncost. The advantage of Piso\u2019s originally looser pluralism is\nthat it accords with the views about value of those who, as Cicero\nputs it, have never come across a philosopher even in a painting\n(5.80). Piso is allowed to reiterate the criticism \u2013 indicating\nits importance for Cicero \u2013 that the Stoics adopt one set of\nterms in real life and another in the lecture room (5.89). But when\nPiso asks disapprovingly whether philosophers should speak in a\ndifferent way from human beings (5.89), it is hard to avoid the\nthought that in his case the terminology of the street now dresses a\nmore rigid substance. In becoming full-fledged theory, his discourse\nis in danger of losing what made it distinctive and attractive as an\naccount of the good human life.\n\nCicero does not tell us which, if any, of the ethical theories that he\ndiscusses we should adopt. Matters are left explicitly unresolved at\nthe close of On Ends (5.95\u20136). Cicero, however, not\nonly offers us tools to think through the issues for ourselves, but in\nso doing, utilises the series of expositions and critiques that he\nlays out to raise pertinent questions, befitting the sceptical stance,\nabout the status of ethical theory itself.\n6.3 Theology\n\nCicero\u2019s manifesto to write, in what proved to be his last\nperiod of literary production, encyclopedically about philosophy, is\nset out in the preface to his work of philosophical theology On\nthe Nature of the Gods. The daunting task he sets himself is\nlinked by him to the specific approach of the Academic sceptic. He\ncites with approval the example of Carneades, who by challenging Stoic\ntheology aroused in people a desire to discover the truth (1.4).\nCicero will take this one step further and aspire to examine\ncritically all the relevant theories about the gods. His conception of\na worthy philosophical encyclopedia is therefore much more than a\ndutiful trotting out of who thought what. His aim is to subject all\navailable views to scrutiny.\n\nIn Cicero\u2019s view this approach fits the questions of theology\nparticularly well, given the many and varied differences of opinion\nthat exist about the nature of the gods. It may be, he declares, that\nnone of the positions are correct; certainly, no more than one can be\n(1.5). The reader is thus put on notice that any view might in\nprinciple be overturned, and it is perhaps no surprise that Cicero\nsays he will need to respond to critics who claim that sceptical\nphilosophy, rather than providing illumination, \u2018floods things\nwith darkness\u2019 (1.6).\n\nIn response, he says that upon the verdict reached about the nature of\nthe gods will depend our assessment of the whole moral and material\napparatus of religion, including by implication traditional Roman\nreligion \u2013 indeed the examples he lists suggest that this is\nprimarily what he has in mind (1.14). When he speaks, at the very\nstart of the work, of its subject being one that was vital \u2018for\nthe regulation of religion\u2019 (1.1), one might easily read that\nconservatively: we investigate the gods in order better to maintain\nthe religious status quo. Now, however, it seems that our\ninvestigation is to be open, our sense of what (if any) is the correct\nreligion awaiting the outcome of enquiry into the nature of the\ngods.\n\nThe greater part of Book 1 is given over to an exposition of Epicurean\ntheology by Cicero\u2019s spokesman Velleius, followed by a critique\nfrom the work\u2019s representative of Academic scepticism, Cotta\n\u2013 Cicero also portrays a younger version of himself as holding\nmainly a listening brief at the discussion. Books 2 and 3 consist\nrespectively of exposition (by Balbus) and critique (by Cotta) of\nStoic theology, which, in stark contrast to the Epicurean version, has\ngod managing the workings of the universe down to the smallest\ndetail.\n\nThe Epicurean gods, on Velleius\u2019 telling, live a life of utter\ntranquility. They have no business to attend to; they simply take\npleasure in their own wisdom and virtue, secure in the knowledge that\ntheir bliss will be everlasting (1.51). Since they have no troubles,\nthey are not involved in the laborious business of creating or\ngoverning the universe, which arises and is sustained by the\nclustering of atoms in the void; they likewise have no concern with\nthe travails of human life (1.52\u201354). This does not, however,\nmean that they are not rightly objects of piety and reverence: we\nworship the sublimity of their nature (1.56).\n\nWe can discern a coherent, if hardly uncontroversial, theological\naccount here. Having previously criticised his opponents for not\nsetting out a clear roster of divine attributes, Velleius is at pains\nto do that himself. The gods are, in a nutshell, immortal, beautiful\nand happy, with the corollaries of happiness meaning that they are\nvirtuous and wise as well. Happiness is inconsistent with making or\nhaving trouble, so god is completely and everlastingly tranquil and at\nrest, enjoying the bliss of that state. Underlying this account is\nwhat one might call a negative principle: god must not exhibit any\nweakness or imperfection. If we now consider the maxim of Epicurus\nthat Velleius cites about the blessed and eternal, its unfolding of\nwhat such a state implies is framed entirely negatively: it does not\nhave troubles or make trouble for others, nor is it in the grip of\nanger or partiality since each is a sign of weakness (1.45). We might\nagree that the concept of god has to be that of a perfect being. And\nconceiving of perfection in terms of a lack of negative qualities is\none way to substantiate what perfection might mean.\n\nThe Epicurean viewpoint also has implications for how we are to\nconsider the relation between god and religion. Velleius\u2019\ninsistence on an anthropomorphic conception of god (1.46\u20138) is,\nin part, motivated by a desire to do justice to the traditional Greek\npicture of the gods \u2013 and, for that matter, the traditional\nRoman one, which shared an anthropomorphic conception with, and was\ndeeply influenced by, the Greek inheritance. Equally, however,\nVelleius takes aim at traditional poetic representations of the gods\nas badly behaved humans on a larger scale. There is, in a correct\nconception of divinity, no place for war, strife, lust, anger or other\nviolent emotions (1.42). And Velleius has little time for ordinary\npeople\u2019s views about the gods, which he dismisses as\n\u2018mired in the greatest inconsistency through their ignorance of\nthe truth\u2019 (1.43).\n\nCicero\u2019s agile use of the dialogue form is manifest in\nCotta\u2019s response. He picks up on an aspect of the Epicurean\nmethod as Velleius had described it, namely that we must infer the\nexistence of the gods from the fact that everyone has a conception (if\noften a distorted conception) that the gods exist. Cotta is happy for\npresent purposes to grant the existence of god, while registering his\ndissatisfaction with both the idea that the belief is universally\nheld, and the notion that, if it were, this would justify inferring\nits truth.\n\nHowever, Cotta also says that while it might be difficult to deny the\nexistence of the gods in a public assembly, it should be easy to do so\nin the sort of meeting they are currently having (1.61). He later adds\nthe thesis that anthropomorphic gods were either thought up by\nphilosophers to encourage ordinary people to turn from vice to worship\nor were a product of a superstition that considered that the worship\nof concrete images allowed access to the gods themselves (1.77). He\nthen presses the idea that the non-interventionist gods of the\nEpicureans are fatal to religion (1.116\u20137, 1.121), while\ncharacterising under the same heading, as \u2018utterly destructive\nof religion\u2019, those who claim that the notion of immortal gods\nis a fiction invented by the wise to lead people unsusceptible to\nreason to do, through religion, their duty (1.118). Cotta does not say\nthat this analysis of the origin of the gods is incorrect; rather, he\nimplies that its public dissemination would undermine the very aim\nthat the analysis posits as an explanation.\n\nWe are back to the question of the relation between one\u2019s theory\nand one\u2019s public pronouncements. On this occasion, Cotta\u2019s\nown stance may seem both cynical and hypocritical: to maintain social\norder one must suppress one\u2019s own views, while reserving\nfrankness for private gatherings of the philosophically minded. Yet\nhere the formal difference between Cicero the author and Cotta the\ncharacter is important. If, within the dramatic setting of On the\nNature of the Gods, the gathering is indeed as Cotta describes,\nits embedding in a written work that Cicero intends to be read more\nwidely blurs the line between private and public on which the charge\nof hypocrisy rests. If Cotta can be convicted of hypocrisy, it is less\nclear that Cicero is open to the same charge. He has let the cat out\nof the bag, and in so doing raised the vital question, for any reader,\nof the extent to which unrestricted frankness of speech can co-exist\nwith the maintenance of social order.\n\nThe Stoic theology expounded next by Balbus seems less immediately\nvulnerable to these practical concerns; here there is a parallel with\nthe respective treatments of the schools\u2019 ethical theories in\nOn Ends. Indeed, while Velleius relied on a relatively\ntechnical and abstract approach in his exposition of the Epicurean\nview, Balbus offers in Stoicism a theology that seems targeted rather\nspecifically at a Roman audience, and this in two distinct ways.\nFirst, the less technical presentation encourages readers who are\nunwilling or unable to enter the more tangled thickets of\nphilosophical theory to engage with the basic ideas. Second, it\npromises to appeal to a Roman sense of specialness and pride in their\nnation by portraying the gods themselves as certifying that attitude\nthrough the interest they take in the wellbeing of Rome.\n\nThus, having separated out \u2018our [Roman] people\u2019 as bearers\nof the belief in gods\u2019 existence, Balbus proceeds to declare\nthat the ever-increasing strength (as he sees it) of religious belief\nis no accident given the way the gods have concretely manifested their\npower. He then cites examples, from both distant and more recent Roman\nmilitary history, of gods seen fighting on the side of Rome, or acting\nas messengers of Roman victory (2.6). He follows this up with tales of\nhow divine premonitions were sent by the gods to warn Rome away from\nimpending disaster, with dire consequences when they were ignored\n(2.7\u20138).\n\nIn fact, Balbus\u2019 lengthy speech both begins and ends with the\nplacing of Rome at the forefront of divine providence. Towards the\nclose of his speech, having argued for the thesis that the care of the\ngods is, to be sure, directed at the whole human race (2.164), he then\ngradually zooms in, first to the specific regions of the world, with\nEurope listed first; then to particular cities, with Rome listed\nfirst; and finally to individuals, all of whom happen to be Romans who\nachieved significant military success (2.165), though there is a nod\nto Greece and the Homeric heroes to bring up the rear.\n\nHence, in terms of the structure of his speech, one of the chief\npoints of theological doctrine that distinguishes the Stoic view from\nthe Epicurean \u2013 namely that the gods are concerned with human\nwellbeing and actively promote it \u2013 becomes, in Balbus\u2019\nhands, the notion that this providential outlook has Rome not as its\nexclusive but certainly as its primary focus. On the face of it, this\nseems like a shrewd strategy: a Roman audience is, perhaps, more\nlikely to be won over by an account that shows the gods as\nRome\u2019s best friend than by one that shuns any notion of divine\nfavour.\n\nYet there is also, from the point of view of the dramatic context,\nsomething peculiar about this approach. Balbus, it is true, is\nconversing with a group of staunch Romans. But they are also Romans\nwhose philosophical sophistication has been emphasised. Is recounting\ntales of divine support for the Roman enterprise really the best way\nto persuade such an audience of the truth of one\u2019s philosophical\nposition? The short answer, of course, is that Cicero\u2019s intended\naudience is wider and no doubt on average less philosophically\nsophisticated than the interlocutors at the scene. But there is a bit\nmore going on than this.\n\nIn Book 1 Velleius\u2019 lucidity of exposition was pointedly\ncontrasted by Cotta with more typical Epicurean obscurity (notably in\nEpicurus himself) in a way that seemed to warn that change of style\ndoes not necessarily leave substance untouched. Balbus in turn speaks\nof the advantages of his own full and rich style over the more\ncompressed argumentative method found in the Stoic theoreticians, in\nparticular Stoicism\u2019s founder Zeno of Citium. But he does so in\na way calculated by Cicero to raise our suspicions: my style of\npresentation, says Balbus, flows like a river; and just as flowing\nrivers avoid being polluted much better than do enclosed pools, so too\nmy stream of eloquence will dilute a critic\u2019s protestations,\nwhile a closely reasoned argument cannot so easily protect itself\n(2.20).\n\nThis is surely intended by Cicero to seem disquieting. If arguments\nneed a cloak of rhetorical eloquence to save them from refutation,\nthen the ideas in support of which those arguments are advanced might,\non reflection, appear less, not more, convincing. Balbus then gives a\nbrief list of some of Zeno\u2019s succinct deductive arguments in\nfavour of the universe being intelligent, wise, happy and eternal, and\ntherefore divine (2.21). So even as Balbus tells us that a more\nflowing presentation has a better chance of evading the\n\u2018calumnies\u2019 of the Academic critics (2.20), we as readers\nare offered the chance by Cicero to exercise our critical judgement on\nsome concrete arguments, while reflecting, in equally critical vein,\non the issue of how philosophy can be communicated without either the\nalienation of excessive technicality or the distortion of an overly\nsmooth rhetoric.\n\nThe issue is then shown to have particular pertinence when religion is\nto the forefront. In his response to Balbus, Cotta, who also held the\nRoman office of priest, picks up on Balbus\u2019 plea, at the end of\nBook 2, that Cotta support Stoic doctrine, by asserting that by this\nwas no doubt meant that he should uphold the ancestral beliefs about\nthe gods and about religious practice \u2013 and, he adds, no\ndiscourse will ever turn him away from such beliefs (3.5). As a Roman\naristocrat of distinguished ancestry and as a priest, it behooves\nCotta to accept ancestral precedent even without rational argument;\nbut, since Balbus is a philosopher, the latter ought to give such\nargument in defence of his claims (3.6). For Cotta, ancestral\nauthority suffices for his belief that the gods exist (3.7, 3.9),\nwhereas Balbus, since he \u2018despises authority\u2019, must fight\nusing reason alone. So, in responding to him, Cotta will pitch his own\nreason against Balbus\u2019 (3.9).\n\nIt seems rather alarming that Cotta the avowed sceptic should tell us\nthat he accepts positions on authority rather than through reason and\nimply that he (unlike Balbus) is no philosopher. One has some sympathy\nwith Balbus\u2019 riposte that, if Cotta is already convinced that\nthe gods exist, why should he want anything from him? (3.7). Of\ncourse, Cotta as a proponent of scepticism is prepared to use the\nweapons of reason against a philosopher. But one suspects that there\nis more to his disclaimers than a sly false modesty designed to\nprovoke Balbus. We might think that appeal to authority is, in the\nreligious case, very much to the point.\n\nReligions are not free-floating products of reason. They are based on\ntradition and the establishment of authority. Tradition of course is\nitself a product of evolution over time. But once something can be\ntalked of as a religion, it already has in place structures and a\nhistory that can be seen to be reasonably deep-rooted and which,\nalthough it can evolve, must retain a sense of connection with those\nroots. In the religious context, tradition rather than reason is the\nprincipal authority, whether that be located in founding figures or\ndocuments, in time-honoured ceremonies and rituals, or in leaders who\ncan claim to inherit the mantle of authority via their own devotion to\nthe tradition \u2013 in the Roman context, the high priests whom\nCotta affirms that he defers to on religious matters, rather than\nStoic theorists (3.5).\n\nCotta has put his finger on something important about the role of\nauthority in religion. If one calls the authority of tradition into\nquestion, then one risks having no religion left. And if one of the\npurposes of religion is, from a practical point of view \u2013 both\nin the Roman context and surely more widely \u2013 the promotion of a\nsense of social cohesion and communal identity, then to challenge\ntradition is to threaten those objectives. So Cotta\u2019s remarks on\nauthority are not an evasion of Balbus\u2019 closing challenge, but\nan acknowledgement of what it means to have a religious commitment in\nthe first place. Cotta\u2019s position here has plausibly been seen\n(Wynne 2019, 167) as an inspiration for fideism, the view that faith\nor tradition is a justificatory source of religious belief independent\nof reason.\n\nWe might nonetheless wonder whether Cotta can compartmentalise things\nso straightforwardly as to be governed by tradition from the point of\nview of his religious and Roman identity, and by reason when it comes\nto philosophical discourse. Here Cotta\u2019s implication that he is\nnot a philosopher perhaps recognises something crucial about the\nnature of reason. The problem is not exactly that one might have\ndifferent approaches in different contexts; in principle, that might\nbe a perfectly sensible way to proceed. It is, rather, that if one\ndemonstrates by reason that, for example, the gods do not exist, then\nthe gods do not exist. Reason is not a compartment in which one can\nstore a certain set of beliefs or conclusions that need not carry over\nto other areas of one\u2019s life. It is an integral part of the\nclaim of reason that its claim is a universal one.\n\nThe tension between reason and tradition is not, then, to be resolved\nsimply by carving out, for example, separate spaces for religion on\nthe one hand and philosophy on the other. At the same time religion\nitself has something important to tell us about the nature of belief.\nWhen Cotta scoffs at Balbus\u2019 assertion, from his main speech,\nthat the tales of gods appearing to us in human form provide evidence\nof their existence, Balbus responds by saying that surely ancient\nauthority must carry some weight with Cotta. To this Cotta replies,\nalong previous lines, that Balbus is offering \u2018hearsay when what\nI ask for is reason\u2019 (3.13). Balbus, as before, owes Cotta a\nrational defence of Stoic claims even if Cotta\u2019s own beliefs do\nnot, and are apparently not required to, rest on such a defence.\n\nThis contrast between beliefs based on hearsay and on rational\njustification invites us to consider what it would be like if the\nlatter were given the unrestricted scope that it seems to demand.\nCotta\u2019s hiving off to the realm of the philosopher the task of\ngiving rational explanations suggests that the role of reason might,\nin fact, have its limits. If, for example, rational justification were\nthe only acceptable basis for holding a belief, it is difficult to\nimagine that one would hold many, or any, beliefs at all. Certainly,\nmany if not most of our beliefs are ones that we simply find ourselves\nwith \u2013 acquired on the authority of \u2018hearsay\u2019,\nwhether that be parents, friends, books, teachers, religious leaders,\npublic figures, or any other source that may not necessarily have\noffered a strict rational justification for claims that we come to\nbelieve.\n\nNow the beliefs that we do come to hold can then be subject to\nrational scrutiny; this notion is at the core of the sceptical\napproach that Cotta, and of course Cicero himself, espouse. But to\nmake sense even of this it seems that we have to take some beliefs as\ngiven in order to find a perspective from which to rationally assess\nothers. A project in which all one\u2019s beliefs are simultaneously\nsubject to the test of rational justification is incoherent. And from\na practical point of view, if we only acted on the basis of those\nbeliefs that had been subject to, and survived, rational scrutiny, we\nwould scarcely act at all.\n\nIf so, then it is not simply a case of religion deferring to reason.\nBeliefs we hold without the legitimation of reason have a necessary\nplace. The upshot seems to be that religious beliefs, insofar as they\neither are not or cannot be subject to rational defence, are more\nrepresentative than one might have supposed of the beliefs we hold\nmore generally. In this regard, On the Nature of the Gods is\nnot uncharacteristic of Cicero\u2019s whole approach to philosophy:\nhe uses his characters\u2019 debates both to advertise the virtues of\nrational enquiry, and to suggest that those virtues reach right the\nway up, as perhaps they should, to the status of rational enquiry\nitself.\n7. Cicero and Bernard Williams\n\nThere is no space here to explore in any detail the question of\nCicero\u2019s later reception. The influence of his philosophical\napproach on his great eighteenth-century successor, David Hume,\nparticularly in matters of theology and religion, is, however,\nwell-documented (see e.g. Fosl 1994, Stuart-Buttle 2020). So it seems\nappropriate instead to juxtapose that approach, albeit briefly, with\nthe work of one of the most noted Anglophone philosophers of the\ntwentieth century, Bernard Williams. Insofar as there are discernible\npoints of contact between the two thinkers, readers may be in a better\nposition to \u2018place\u2019 Cicero\u2019s philosophical project\nwhich, in its context of Roman politics and Hellenistic philosophical\ndebate, is liable to appear a little recondite to contemporary\neyes.\n\nLike Williams, then, Cicero engages deeply with his philosophical\npredecessors not principally as a historical exercise but as a\ncreative way of doing, and communicating, philosophy. Like Williams,\nhe is concerned to explore the scope and limits of philosophical\ntheory, especially ethical theory, in relation to the character of\nlived human experience. Both thinkers take the view that theory tends\nto fall short in accounting for how one should live in practical\ncontexts and for the place of integrity in an agent\u2019s life. Each\ncombines a belief in the power of philosophy to illuminate with a\nmarked scepticism about some of the claims that philosophy makes for\nitself. Not unconnectedly, the two thinkers show great care in the way\nthey write philosophy; both evince a distaste for technicality for its\nown sake.\n\nIt is an irony in the history of philosophy that Williams himself,\nduring a discussion of ancient scepticism, refers to Cicero, in\npassing, as a \u2018third-rate\u2019 thinker (2006, 33). If the\naffinities with Williams sketched here are anywhere near the mark,\nreaders may be motivated to explore, by engaging with Cicero\u2019s\nphilosophical work themselves, whether that verdict is entirely\njust.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<p>\nAll of Cicero\u2019s works are available with Latin text and facing\nEnglish translation in the <em>Loeb Classical Library</em> series.
