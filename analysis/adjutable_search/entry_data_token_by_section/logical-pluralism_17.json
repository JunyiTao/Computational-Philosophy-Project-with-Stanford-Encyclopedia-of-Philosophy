    "main_text": "Further Kinds of Logical Pluralism || Pluralism about Epistemic Normativity\n5.4 Pluralism about Epistemic Normativity\n\nHartry Field proposes another kind of logical pluralism (Field 2009).\nThe view rests on the thesis that logic is normative (see\n \u00a72.2)\n along with a pluralism about epistemic normativity. Field holds that\nthere are many possible epistemic norms, and that we might think of\nagents as endorsing one, or\u2014more likely\u2014different norms at\ndifferent times, and as having views about how good different possible\nepistemic norms are. We use these epistemic norms to evaluate\nthemselves, and other norms (think of using numerical induction to\nevaluate both induction and counter-induction). Some norms do well by\ntheir own lights, in which case we feel no tension. Some do badly even\nby their own lights, in which case we feel pressure to change them.\nThere\u2019s no sense, on Field\u2019s view, in regarding any of\nthese norms as correct or incorrect, but he does think that it makes\nsense to call them better or worse, so long as we recognize that these\nevaluations are relative to our epistemic goals. Still, though this\nmakes norms criticizable and evaluable, it doesn\u2019t mean that\nthere will be a uniquely best norm. \n\n\nFor instance, there might be a sequence of better and better norms for\nachieving the goals; in addition, there might be ties and/or\nincomparabilities \u201carbitrarily far up\u201d. (Field 2009: 355)\n\n\n\nHence we have an epistemic normative pluralism.\n\nSimilarly, we can use our epistemic norms\u2014including deductive\nlogics\u2014to evaluate how well various deductive logics perform in\nachieving epistemic goals we have, e.g., resolving the semantic\nparadoxes. And again \n\n\n\u2026it isn\u2019t obvious that there need be a uniquely best\nlogic for a given goal, much less that we should think of one logic as\n\u201cuniquely correct\u201d in some goal independent sense. (Field\n2009: 356) \n\n\nThe result then, is a kind of logical pluralism: logics are better or\nworse relative to different goals, but even relative to a\nparticular goal, it might be that no single logic is the unique\nbest one.\n",
