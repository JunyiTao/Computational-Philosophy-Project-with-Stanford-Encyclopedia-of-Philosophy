Philosophical Principles\n\nAlthough his words are meant to provide concrete vicarious encounters\nwith the world, Heraclitus adheres to some abstract principles which\ngovern the world. Already in antiquity he was famous for advocating\nthe coincidence of opposites, the flux doctrine, and his view that\nfire is the source and nature of all things. In commenting on\nHeraclitus, Plato provided an early reading, followed tentatively by\nAristotle, and popular down to the present (sharpened and forcefully\nadvocated by Barnes 1982, ch. 4). According to Barnes\u2019 version,\nHeraclitus is a material monist who believes that all things are\nmodifications of fire. Everything is in flux (in the sense that\n\u201ceverything is always flowing in some respects,\u201d\n69), which entails the coincidence of opposites (interpreted as the\nview that \u201cevery pair of contraries is somewhere coinstantiated;\nand every object coinstantiates at least one pair of\ncontraries,\u201d 70). The coincidence of opposites, thus\ninterpreted, entails contradictions, which Heraclitus cannot avoid. On\nthis view Heraclitus is influenced by the prior theory of material\nmonism and by empirical observations that tend to support flux and the\ncoincidence of opposites. In a time before the development of logic,\nBarnes concludes, Heraclitus violates the principles of logic and\nmakes knowledge impossible.\n\nObviously this reading is not charitable to Heraclitus. There are,\nmoreover, reasons to question it. First, some of Heraclitus\u2019\nviews are incompatible with material monism (to be discussed later),\nso that the background of his theories must be rethought. Second,\nthere is evidence that Heraclitus\u2019 flux theory is weaker than\nthat attributed to him by this reading. Third, there is evidence that\nhis view of the coincidence of opposites is weaker than that\nattributed to him here. \n",
