    "main_text": "\n1. Formulations of the principle of double effect\n\nThomas Aquinas is credited with introducing the principle of double\neffect in his discussion of the permissibility of self-defense in the\nSumma Theologica (II-II, Qu. 64, Art.7). Killing one\u2019s\nassailant is justified, he argues, provided one does not intend to\nkill him. In contrast, Augustine had earlier maintained that killing\nin self-defense was not permissible, arguing that \u201cprivate\nself-defense can only proceed from some degree of inordinate\nself-love.\u201d Aquinas observes that \u201cNothing hinders one act\nfrom having two effects, only one of which is intended, while the\nother is beside the intention. \u2026 Accordingly, the act of\nself-defense may have two effects: one, the saving of one\u2019s\nlife; the other, the slaying of the aggressor.\u201d As\nAquinas\u2019s discussion continues, a justification is provided that\nrests on characterizing the defensive action as a means to a goal that\nis justified: \u201cTherefore, this act, since one\u2019s intention\nis to save one\u2019s own life, is not unlawful, seeing that it is\nnatural to everything to keep itself in being as far as\npossible.\u201d However, Aquinas observes, the permissibility of\nself-defense is not unconditional: \u201cAnd yet, though proceeding\nfrom a good intention, an act may be rendered unlawful if it be out of\nproportion to the end. Wherefore, if a man in self-defense uses more\nthan necessary violence, it will be unlawful, whereas, if he repel\nforce with moderation, his defense will be lawful.\u201d\n\nThe passage can be interpreted as formulating a prohibition on\napportioning one\u2019s efforts with killing as the goal guiding\none\u2019s actions, which would lead one to act with greater\nviciousness than pursuing the goal of self-defense would require.\n\nLater versions of the double effect principle all emphasize the\ndistinction between causing a morally grave harm as a side effect of\npursuing a good end and causing a morally grave harm as a means of\npursuing a good end. We can summarize this by noting that for certain\ncategories of morally grave actions, for example, causing the death of\na human being, the principle of double effect combines the claim that\nit can be morally permissible to cause a death incidentally as a side\neffect of pursuing a good end with a general prohibition on causing\nthe death of an innocent human being for the sake of a good end. The\nprohibition is absolute in traditional Catholic applications of the\nprinciple. Two traditional formulations appear below.\n\nThe New Catholic Encyclopedia provides four conditions for\nthe application of the principle of double effect:\n\nThe act itself must be morally good or at least indifferent.\nThe agent may not positively will the bad effect but may permit\nit. If he could attain the good effect without the bad effect he\nshould do so. The bad effect is sometimes said to be indirectly\nvoluntary.\nThe good effect must flow from the action at least as immediately\n(in the order of causality, though not necessarily in the order of\ntime) as the bad effect. In other words the good effect must be\nproduced directly by the action, not by the bad effect. Otherwise the\nagent would be using a bad means to a good end, which is never\nallowed.\nThe good effect must be sufficiently desirable to compensate for\nthe allowing of the bad effect (see Connell, 1021).\n\n\nThe conditions provided by Joseph Mangan include the explicit\nrequirement that the bad effect not be intended:\n\n\nA person may licitly perform an action that he foresees will produce a\ngood effect and a bad effect provided that four conditions are\nverified at one and the same time:\n\nthat the action in itself from its very object be good or at least\nindifferent;\nthat the good effect and not the evil effect be intended;\nthat the good effect be not produced by means of the evil\neffect;\nthat there be a proportionately grave reason for permitting the\nevil effect (Mangan 1949, p. 43).\n\n\n\nIn both of these accounts, the fourth condition, the proportionality\ncondition is usually understood to involve determining if the extent\nof the harm is adequately offset by the magnitude of the proposed\nbenefit.\n\nPeter Cataldo formulates the first condition in a way that focuses on\nthe \u201cmoral object\u201d of the act:\n\n1\u2032.\nThe moral object of the act must be good or at least not be\nintrinsically immoral (Cataldo 2022, 3).\n\n\nCataldo also reports that the Catholic moral tradition provides useful\nclarification of the fourth \u201cproportionality\u201d condition by\nrecognizing five different dimensions of assessment: \u201cthe degree\nof badness of the effect; the degree of dependence of the bad effect\non the act; the proximity of the effect to the bad act; the degree of\ncertainty that the bad effect will occur; and the degree of obligation\nto prevent the bad act\u201d (Cataldo 2022, 9. fn. 12).\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that agents who regret causing harm will be\ndisposed to avoid causing the harm or to minimize how much of it they\ncause. This assumption could be made explicit as an additional\ncondition on permissibly causing unintended harm:\n\nthat agents attempt to minimize the foreseen harm and consider\nless harmful alternatives.\n\n\nMichael Walzer (1977) has convincingly argued that agents who cause\nharm as a foreseen side effect of promoting a good end must be willing\nto accept additional risk or to forego some benefit in order to\nminimize how much harm they cause. Whether harm has been minimized\nwill depend on the agent\u2019s current circumstances and the options\navailable.\n\nDouble effect might also be part of a secular and non-absolutist view\naccording to which a justification adequate for causing a certain harm\nas a side effect of pursuing a good end might not be adequate for\ncausing that harm as a means to the same good end under the same\ncircumstances.\n2. Applications\n\nMany morally reflective people have been persuaded that something\nalong the lines of double effect must be correct. No doubt this is\nbecause at least some of the examples cited as illustrations of DE\nhave considerable intuitive appeal.\n\nTerror bomber vs Tactical bomber: The terror\nbomber aims to bring about civilian deaths in order to weaken the\nresolve of the enemy: when his bombs kill civilians this is a\nconsequence that he intends. The tactical bomber aims at military\ntargets while foreseeing that bombing such targets will cause civilian\ndeaths. When his bombs kill civilians this is a foreseen but\nunintended consequence of his actions. Even if it is equally certain\nthat the two bombers will cause the same number of civilian deaths,\nterror bombing is impermissible while tactical bombing is\npermissible.\n\nEuthanasia vs Pain relief that hastens death:\nA doctor who intends to hasten the death of a terminally ill\npatient by injecting a large dose of morphine would act impermissibly\nbecause he intends to bring about the patient\u2019s death. However,\na doctor who intended to relieve the patient\u2019s pain with that\nsame dose and merely foresaw the hastening of the patient\u2019s\ndeath would act permissibly. (The mistaken assumption that the use of\nopioid drugs for pain relief tends to hasten death is discussed below\nin section 5.1.)\n\nAbortion vs Hysterectomy: A doctor who\nbelieved that abortion was wrong, even in order to save the\nmother\u2019s life, might nevertheless consistently believe that it\nwould be permissible to perform a hysterectomy on a pregnant woman\nwith cancer. In carrying out the hysterectomy, the doctor would aim to\nsave the woman\u2019s life while merely foreseeing the death of the\nfetus. Performing an abortion, by contrast, would involve intending to\nkill the fetus as a means to saving the mother.\n\nPre-emptive Killing vs Active Self-defense:\nTo kill a person whom you know to be plotting to kill you\nwould be impermissible because it would be a case of intentional\nkilling; however, to strike in self-defense against an aggressor is\npermissible, even if one foresees that the blow by which one defends\noneself will be fatal.\n\nSuicide vs Heroic Shielding: Sacrificing\none\u2019s own life in order to save the lives of others can be\ndistinguished from suicide by characterizing the agent\u2019s\nintention: a soldier who throws himself on a live grenade intends to\nshield others from its blast and merely foresees his own death; by\ncontrast, a person who commits suicide intends to bring his or her own\nlife to an end.\n\nThe Trolley Problems, Pushing a Bystander onto a Track to\nstop the trolley vs Diverting a Trolley onto a track with one person\naway from a track with five: You are a bystander\nstanding near a switch watching a runaway trolley barrel down a track\non which five people who cannot escape are positioned. Pushing another\nbystander onto the track to stop the trolley would be wrong, many\nbelieve. However, many believe that it would be permissible to turn a\nswitch and divert the trolley onto a different track on which one\nperson who cannot escape is positioned (examples from Thomson, 1985,\nbased on examples in Foot 1967).\n3. Misinterpretations\n\nDoes the principle of double effect play the important explanatory\nrole that has been claimed for it? To consider this question, one must\nbe careful to clarify just what the principle is supposed to explain.\nThree misinterpretations of the principle\u2019s force or range of\napplication are common.\n\nFirst, the Doctrine of Double Effect does not claim that the fact that\na harm was foreseen and not intended by an agent is sufficient to\nexplain the permissibility of causing it. Applications of double\neffect always presuppose that some kind of proportionality condition\nhas been satisfied and plausible accounts of double effect require\nagents to minimize harms brought about as side effects. Classifying\ncivilian casualties during wartime as merely foreseen but unintended\nside effects of pursuing a military objective does not show that the\nagents were not morally responsible for these consequences or that\nthey were permissibly brought about. Quite obviously, a\nphysician\u2019s justification for administering drugs to relieve a\npatient\u2019s pain while foreseeing the hastening of death as a side\neffect does not depend only on the fact that the physician foresees\nbut does not intend the hastening of death; that explanation could not\njustify treating the pain of kidney stones with a lethal dose of\nmorphine.\n\nA second misinterpretation is fostered by applications of double\neffect that contrast the foreseen harms that one permissibly\nallows to occur with intended harms that one impermissibly\ncauses by acting to promote a good end. The distinction\nbetween causing and allowing can be distinguished from the distinction\nbetween intended and merely foreseen consequences of acting (see\n Doing vs. Allowing Harm).\n\nA third misinterpretation of double effect bases the impermissibility\nof causing harm as a means to a good end on the fact that it is\nwrongful in itself to intend to cause harm. There are many\ncircumstances in which agents may cause harms as a means to a good end\nand in such cases, producing a harm as a means to a good end is\ncompatible with having an appropriate attitude toward the harm.\nSurgeons may amputate limbs to save lives while regretting the damage,\nthe disfigurement, and the disability that their actions will cause. A\ndentist may apologetically probe while instructing her patient\n\u201ctell me where it hurts\u201d. This is why plausible accounts\nof double effect insist on the importance of the proportionality\ncondition and the requirement to minimize harm and to seek less\nharmful alternatives: it is directed at agents who aim at good ends\nand seek guidance about what they may do to promote them.\n4. Criticisms\n4.1 Consequentialist Objections\n\nThose who defend the principle of double effect often assume that\ntheir opponents deny that an agent\u2019s intentions, motives, and\nattitudes are important factors in determining the permissibility of a\ncourse of action. If the permissibility of an action depended only on\nthe consequences of the action, or only on the foreseen or foreseeable\nconsequences of the action, then the distinction that grounds the\nprinciple of double effect would not have the moral significance\nclaimed for it (see the related entry on\n consequentialism).\n Some opponents of the principle of double effect do indeed deny that\nthe distinction between intended and merely foreseen consequences ever\nhas any kind of moral significance.\n\nNevertheless, many criticisms of the principle of double effect do not\nproceed from consequentialist assumptions or skepticism about the\nimportance and moral significance of distinguishing between what an\nagent intends and what an agent merely foresees. Instead, critics ask\nwhether the principle adequately codifies the moral intuitions at play\nin the cases that have been taken to be illustrations of it.\n4.2 The Problem of Closeness\n\nOne important line of criticism is known as the \u201cproblem of\ncloseness\u201d: it is difficult to distinguish between grave harms\nthat are regretfully foreseen as side effects of the agent\u2019s\nmeans and grave harms that are so close to the agent\u2019s means\nthat it seems that they must be (regretfully) intended as part of the\nagent\u2019s means. In the Abortion vs Hysterectomy example,\nit is hard to see why the death of the fetus would not be a\nregretfully foreseen side effect of saving the mother\u2019s life in\nboth cases (Boyle 1991). Or, alternatively, it is hard to see why the\ndeath of the fetus would not be regretfully intended as part of the\nphysician\u2019s means of saving the mother\u2019s life in both\ncases (Davis 1984, 110). Those who wish to apply double effect to this\nexample must provide principled grounds for distinguishing between the\ncases in this way; no clear resolution of this problem has emerged (a\nsummary of proposals is discussed by Dana Nelkin and Samuel Rickless\n2015).\n4.3 The Side Effect Effect\n\nAre we more inclined to call a harmful result a merely foreseen side\neffect when we believe that it is permissibly brought about, while\nalso being more inclined to describe a harmful result as something\nthat was intended as part of the agent\u2019s means when we believe\nthat it is impermissibly brought about? If so, there will be an\nassociation between permissible harms that are classified as side\neffects and impermissibly caused harms that are classified as results\nbrought about intentionally, but this association cannot be explained\nby the principle of double effect. Research by Joshua Knobe (2003,\n2006) has demonstrated that the ways in which we distinguish between\nresults that are intended or brought about intentionally and those\nthat are mere side effects may be influenced by normative judgments in\nsuch a way as to bias our descriptions: we are more likely to say a\nresult was brought about intentionally when we disapprove of it. This\nwas first pointed out by Gilbert Harman (1976), but is now often\nreferred to as \u201cThe Knobe Effect\u201d or \u201cThe Side\nEffect Effect\u201d. Suppose that an agent decided to swerve a\nrunaway trolley away from a track with a rare wildflower on it and\nonto a track with one track workman on it. Would you say that the\nagent intended to cause the track workman\u2019s death in order to\nspare the wildflower? If you would also say that the bystander who\nswitches the trolley away from the track with five track workmen on it\nand onto a track with one track workman on it foresees the death of\nthe one as a side effect of saving the five, but does not intend it,\nthen your judgments exemplify the Side Effect Effect. If you believe\nthat it is permissible to swerve the trolley onto the one to save five\nbut not permissible to swerve the trolley onto the one to save the\nwildflower, then this moral judgment influences whether the death of\nthe one is intended or a merely foreseen side effect. Does the\ndistinction between intended and merely foreseen consequences of\naction relied upon by the principle of double effect fail to serve as\nan evaluatively neutral basis for moral judgments? If so, it might\nguide and explain how actions are described without being a reliable\nguide to evaluating actions.\n4.4 Direct and Indirect Agency\n\nWarren Quinn has proposed that what is valuable and correct about\napplications of double effect could be formulated as involving a\ndistinction between direct and indirect agency. On his view, double\neffect \u201cdistinguishes between agency in which harm comes to some\nvictims, at least in part, from the agent\u2019s deliberately\ninvolving them in something in order to further his purpose precisely\nby way of their being so involved (agency in which they figure as\nintentional objects), and harmful agency in which either nothing is in\nthat way intended for the victims or what is so intended does not\ncontribute to their harm\u201d (1989, p. 343; see also Nelkin and\nRickless, 2014). Quinn explains that \u201cdirect agency requires\nneither that harm itself be useful nor that what is useful be causally\nconnected in some especially close way with the harm it helps bring\nabout\u201d (1989, p. 344). He acknowledges that \u201csome cases of\nharming that the doctrine intuitively speaks against are arguably not\ncases of intentional harming, precisely because neither the harm\nitself (nor anything itself causally very close to it) is\nintended\u201d (1991, p. 511).\n\nQuinn\u2019s reformulation of double effect is not absolutist in\ncharacter. He observes that a result brought about through direct\nagency might not be impermissible; instead it would require more\noffsetting benefit than the same result brought about through indirect\nagency in similar circumstances.\n\nQuinn\u2019s proposal would effectively broaden the category of\nresults that count as the more problematic form of direct agency in\ncausing harm. As a result, if we believe that some forms of direct\nagency that involve causing death are permissible, we will have to\nseek some other explanation than double effect\u2019s claim that the\nharms are indirect or merely foreseen. The soldier who throws himself\non the grenade in order to shield his fellow soldiers from the force\nof an explosion has directly involved himself in the protective\naction. Shelly Kagan (1999, 145) points out that if someone else were\nto shove the soldier on the grenade we would certainly say that that\nthe harm to the soldier was intended by the person who did the\nshoving, even if the shoving was intended to promote the goal of\nsaving the lives of others. Equally, we should say that it is intended\nin this case \u2013 not as a goal or as an end pursued for its own\nsake but as a means to an end. The same kind of argument can be made\nfor cases of killing in self-defense when overwhelming and lethal\nforce is used. If these are cases of permissible direct agency, and if\nQuinn is right that the distinction between direct and indirect agency\nexplains the intuitive appeal of double effect\u2019s contrast\nbetween intended means and foreseen side effects, then these cases\ncast doubt on the claim that double effect explains why the\nlife-saving actions in the Hysterectomy, Heroic Shielding and\nSelf-defense examples are permissible.\n4.5 Does double effect provide an adequate explanation of the trolley cases?\n\nIt seems clear to many people that if one were to switch the trolley\nfrom a track with five people to a track with only one, the harm to\nthe one person would not be intended as part of one\u2019s means of\ndiverting the trolley from the five to save their lives and would\ntherefore count as a foreseen side effect of swerving the trolley.\nQuinn\u2019s proposal would not count it as a case of direct agency.\nThese considerations alone do not show that it is justified to switch\nthe trolley. Double effect might seem to explain the contrasting\nimpermissibility of pushing someone onto the track in front of the\nspeeding trolley in order to stop it in order to protect five people\nwho cannot escape on the track ahead. In both scenarios, a person\nwould be killed as part of one\u2019s plan for saving the five.\nBecause of this, the difference in permissibility might seem to depend\non whether the death of that person is a means to saving the five or a\nside effect of doing so.\n\nDiscussions of the Trolley Problem and the relevance of the principle\nof double effect to explaining our intuition that it is permissible to\nswerve the trolley can be divided into three groups. First, there are\nthose who take the paired intuitions in the Trolley Problem as proof\nof the fundamental role of the distinction between intended means and\nforeseen side effects in an implicit principle guiding moral judgment\n(Mikhail, 2011). Second, some argue that it would be wrong for a\nbystander to switch the trolley (Thomson, 2008, contradicting Thomson\n1976 and 1985) and suggest that people\u2019s willingness to view it\nas permissible is a result of inadequate reflection. This group would\ninclude those who uphold an absolutist version of the principle of\ndouble effect and deny that it provides a permission to swerve the\ntrolley (Anscombe, 1982). Third, one could reject the claim that the\nprinciple of double effect could explain the permissibility of\nswitching the trolley (McIntyre, 2001), while remaining neutral about\nwhat verdict to render about such artificial cases.\n\nCan our intuitions about the Trolley Problem be generalized to other\ncases? Autonomous vehicles might be equipped with algorithms that\ntreat the alleged permissibility of swerving the trolley away from the\nfive and onto the one as an important precedent. Avoiding dangerous\ncollisions with other vehicles by swerving onto sidewalks where\npedestrians may or may not be be present might be viewed as ethically\nsimilar to swerving the trolley. Or, as Patrick Lin suggests (2016,\n76\u20137), an autonomous car driving on a cliffside roadway that\nencounters a school bus with many passengers that has moved into its\nlane as it rounds a sharp corner, might decide to sacrifice itself and\nits passengers to avoid the more dangerous collision with a school bus\nand the greater predicted loss of life. This should make us all\nconsider whether the highly abstract and context-less trolley problem\nelicits reliable moral judgments that can be used as a precedent in\nprogramming autonomous vehicles (see also discussion of the trolley\nproblem and autonomous vehicles in Nyholm and Smids 2016). You, as the\nBystander at the Switch, have no special positive duty toward the five\nthat requires you to assist them, and you have no special negative\nduty toward the one that requires you not to harm him. What duties\ndoes an autonomous vehicle have to its driver, other drivers, and\nnearby pedestrians? Have drivers assumed a risk simply by driving that\npedestrians have not assumed by using a sidewalk? Should the\nalgorithms promote ethical concerns or the interests of drivers? Who\nwould buy an autonomous vehicle that would always sacrifice its\npassengers to prevent greater loss of life?\n4.6 Does Double Effect Explain the Permissibility of Risky Rescues and Rescue by Reducing the Extent of Harm?\n\nProponents of double effect have argued that agents may cause certain\nand serious harm or run the risk of causing serious harm when they are\ntrying to prevent even greater harm that would otherwise be certain to\noccur. In such cases, the harm or the risk of harm is described as\nforeseen by the agent but not intended. Dangerous surgery undertaken\nto save a life is one example (Anscombe 1982; Boyle 1991; Uniacke\n1998). Uniacke mentions that the distinction between intended and\nforeseen effects can also be applied to acts of justifiable\nrisk-taking in which the good effect and the bad effect are\n\u201cincompatible outcomes\u201d, noting that a parent might\njustifiably throw a child out of a burning building in an attempt to\nsave its life (1998, s. 3). The parent intends to prevent certain\ndeath, while foreseeing that the rescue might cause death.\n\nCould it be claimed that the rescuing agents foresaw a risk of causing\nharm as a side effect of their attempt at rescue but did not intend to\nrisk harm to those they were trying to rescue? Proponents of double\neffect claim that the physician foresaw but did not intend that the\npatient might not survive risky surgery, that the parent foresaw but\ndid not intend that the child could be killed by the fall, and that\nthe soldier foresaw but did not intend to cause his own death (Uniacke\n1998). But this justification is incomplete for two reasons. First,\nemphasizing that the risk of causing death is foreseen by the\nrescuer but not intended by the rescuer implicitly compares\nthe rescuer\u2019s motives with the motives of agents who aimed to\ncause death as an end, out of malice, callousness, or some other\nwrongful motive. But double effect speaks only about the contrast\nbetween harming as a side effect of promoting a good end and harming\nas part of one\u2019s means of promoting a good end. Second, this\njustification fails to distinguish between intending to impose a risk\nof death on a person by acting in a certain way and intending to cause\ndeath. These agents certainly did not intend to cause death, but they\ndid intend to impose a risk of death on a person by acting in a\ncertain way.\n\nThe physician who undertakes dangerous surgery in a patient who would\notherwise face certain death is attempting to reduce the risk of harm\nto the patient. Undertaking the risky surgery constitutes the\nphysician\u2019s means of lowering the patient\u2019s risk of death.\nThe surgery is chosen because it imposes a lower risk of death on the\npatient than what the patient faced without it. The surgeon intended\nto impose a (lower) risk of death on the patient by undertaking the\nrisky surgery. Given that fact, it is not true that the surgeon did\nnot intend to impose a risk of harm. Imposing a (lower) risk of harm\nin order to prevent a greater harm is exactly what the agent intended\nto do. This was not a foreseen side effect of action, this was what\nconstituted the physician\u2019s attempt to save the patient\u2019s\nlife.\n\nSimilarly, the soldier who throws himself on a grenade is attempting\nto reduce the extent of the harm that the explosion will cause by\nattempting to absorb the force of the explosion with his body. The\nheroic action is chosen because it imposes a very high risk of harm to\nhimself, thereby lowering the risk of harm to others nearby. Such\nrescues seem to be cases in which agents act permissibly when they\nchoose to impose a risk of death on someone as their means of lowering\nthat person\u2019s risk of death (surgery, burning building) or as\ntheir means of lowering the risk of harm to others nearby\n(self-sacrifice). This involves imposing a risk of harm on a person in\norder to promote a good end. It seems that the agents do intend to\nimpose a risk of harm on the person they involve: that is their means\nto the good end. If this is permissible, double effect does not have\nthe resources to explain why it is permissible, since it is harmful\n\u2013 but justifiably harmful \u2013 direct agency. These cases\nsatisfy Warren Quinn\u2019s definition of direct agency as agency in\nwhich \u201charm comes to some victims, at least in part, from the\nagent\u2019s deliberately involving them in something in order to\nfurther his purpose precisely by way of their being so involved\n(agency in which they figure as intentional objects),\u201d and they\nclearly do not satisfy the definition of harmful indirect agency as\nagency \u201cin which either nothing is in that way intended for the\nvictims or what is so intended does not contribute to their\nharm\u201d (1989, p. 343). If the risky surgery is unsuccessful and\nthe patient dies, the surgeon cannot say that what was intended,\ndangerous but potentially life-saving surgery, did not contribute to\nthe harm.\n4.7 The Role of Conventions and Norms in Warfare\n\nThe contrast between the Terror Bomber and the Tactical Bomber is\noften viewed as the least controversial pair of examples illustrating\nthe distinction between intention and foresight that underlies the\nprinciple of double effect. The judgment that the Terror Bomber acts\nimpermissibly and the Tactical Bomber acts permissibly is widely\naffirmed. Terror bombing was engaged in by both sides in World War II\n(see Douglas Lackey (1989) for a thoughtful historical account of the\ndecision process engaged in by Allied decision-makers and the\ncontroversy it generated at the time). The view that terror bombing is\nalways impermissible would condemn the kind of incendiary bombing\ncarried out by Allied forces in Germany and Japan.\n\nThe common judgment that tactical bombing is permissible provided that\nit is proportionate also deserves more scrutiny than it usually\nreceives when it is taken to be justified by the principle of double\neffect. How much of an obligation do military strategists have to\navoid harm to civilian populations? This is a substantive issue about\nthe conventions that constrain military decision-making and the\nprinciples that underlie these conventions. Many relevant\nconsiderations depend on judgments that are far outside the ambit of\nDouble Effect. For example, the Rules of Customary International\nHumanitarian Law displayed on the website of the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross prohibit attacks targeting civilians. They\nalso include protections designed to minimize harm to civilians:\n\n\nRule 15. Precautions in Attack In the conduct of military\noperations, constant care must be taken to spare the civilian\npopulation, civilians and civilian objects. All feasible precautions\nmust be taken to avoid, and in any event to minimize, incidental loss\nof civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian\nobjects.\n\nRule 20. Advance Warning Each party to the conflict must give\neffective advance warning of attacks which may affect the civilian\npopulation, unless circumstances do not permit.\n\nRule 24. Removal of Civilians and Civilian Objects from the\nVicinity of Military Objectives Each party to the conflict must,\nto the extent feasible, remove civilian persons and objects under its\ncontrol from the vicinity of military objectives.\n\n\nThese considerations suggest that the principle of double effect does\nnot contain, even when the principle of proportionality is included as\npart of its content, a sufficient condition of permissibility for\nbombardment that affects civilian populations. The example so\nfrequently invoked by philosophers concerning the permissibility of\ntactical bombing in which civilian deaths are foreseen never mentions\na duty to warn or remove civilians.\n5. End of Life Decision-Making\n5.1 Pain Relief in Palliative Care\n\nThe principle of double effect is often mentioned in discussions of\nwhat is known as palliative care, medical care for patients with\nterminal illness in need of pain relief. Double effect is cited as a\njustification for the view that it is permissible to administer opioid\ndrugs to relieve the suffering of a terminally ill patient, foreseeing\nthat the hastening of death will occur as a side effect. Double effect\nreasoning in this context seems to express the compassionate view that\nphysicians may not intend to cause the death of a patient, but may\naccept that actions intended to relieve pain might hasten death. Three\nassumptions often operate in the background of these discussions:\n\nIt would be impermissible to administer an opioid drug in a dose\nhigh enough to hasten the patient\u2019s death in order to cut short\nthe suffering of a terminally ill patient in the process of\ndying.\nThe side effect of hastening death is an inevitable or at least\nlikely result of the administration of an opioid drug in order to\nrelieve the pain of a terminally ill patient.\nThe hastening of death is a not unwelcome side effect of providing\npain relief in the context of palliative care.\n\n\nIf the first assumption is not made, double effect has no explanatory\nrole to play. Those who appeal to double effect in this context must\nalso assume that it would be impermissible to hasten the death\nintentionally of a terminally ill patient whom one was\ntreating with opioids for pain in order to shorten the process of\ndying. If one believes that this is permissible, then double effect is\nnot needed to explain its permissibility.\n\nThe second assumption is false. Physicians and researchers have\ninsisted repeatedly that it is a myth that opioids administered for\npain relief can be expected to hasten death (Sykes and Thorns, 2003\nprovide a review of a large number of studies supporting this claim).\nThere is no research that substantiates the claim that opioid drugs\nadministered appropriately and carefully titrated are likely to\ndepress respiration. In a survey of research bearing on this issue,\nSusan Anderson Fohr (1998) concludes: \u201cIt is important to\nemphasize that there is no debate among specialists in palliative care\nand pain control on this issue. There is a broad consensus that when\nused appropriately, respiratory depression from opioid analgesics is a\nrarely occurring side effect. The belief that palliative care hastens\ndeath is counter to the experience of physicians with the most\nexperience in this area.\u201d The mistaken belief that pain relief\nwill have the side effect of hastening death may have the unfortunate\neffect of leading physicians, patients, and the patients\u2019\nfamilies to under-treat pain because they are apprehensive about\ncausing this allegedly inevitable side effect.\n\nThe third claim \u2013 that the hastening of death is not unwelcome\nin these circumstances \u2013 ignores the role of the patient and the\npatient\u2019s medical proxy in assessing whether hastening death is\na desirable result. It represents the physician\u2019s role as one\nthat does not require consultation with the patient or the\npatient\u2019s proxy or attention to advance directives for guidance.\nIf hastening the death of a patient with a terminal condition is\ndesirable according to the patient or the patient\u2019s proxy, then\nmany thoughtful people would view the first assumption to be false: it\nwould be permissible to intend to relieve pain while also intending to\nhasten the death of a terminally ill patient (see Allmark, Cobb,\nLiddle, and Todd 2010; Kamm 1999; Quinn 1989, 343, n.17; McIntyre\n2004). On the other hand, if the hastening of death is not desirable\naccording to the patient or the patient\u2019s proxy, it is not\npermissible to hasten death in the course of treating pain, especially\nsince hastening death is neither likely nor inevitable when treating\npain. Patients receiving palliative care whose pain can be adequately\ntreated with opioid drugs may well value additional days, hours or\nminutes of life as they look forward to meetings with family members.\nA physician\u2019s duty of compassion does not override the\npatient\u2019s preferences in such a weighty matter. The apparently\ncompassionate assumption that the hastening of death is a desirable\nresult when a patient is being treated for pain is unduly\npaternalistic in this context.\n\nNote that if the physician views the hastening of death as something\nthat would be good for the patient, and the patient or the\npatient\u2019s proxy agrees, then even a secular version of double\neffect does not apply to this situation: the hastening of death would\nbe a benefit for the patient, not a harm. As the discussion in\nSection 1 (Formulations) has shown, any plausible\nformulation of double effect would require agents to seek to minimize\nor avoid the merely foreseen harms that they cause as side effects. On\nthis point, popular understandings of double effect reasoning at the\nend of life, with the third assumption in place, diverge from what the\nprinciple assumes: the popular understanding of double effect might\ninvolve the assumption that hastening death is a merciful act and not\na harm to be avoided.\n\nNote that a variety of substantive medical and ethical judgments\nprovide the justificatory context for this example: the patient is\nterminally ill, there is an urgent need to relieve pain and suffering,\ndeath is imminent, and we can now add that the condition that the\npatient or the patient\u2019s proxy consents. The consent of the\npatient or the patient\u2019s proxy is not naturally classified as a\nconcern with proportionality, understood as the physician\u2019s\nweighing of harms and benefits.\n5.2 Terminal Sedation\n\nIn a U.S. Supreme Court decision that rejected arguments for\npermitting patients with terminal illness to request assistance from a\nphysician in ending their lives (Vacco et al. v. Quill et al., 117\nS.Ct. 2293 (1997), Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for the\nmajority, invoked double effect not only as a justification for the\nadministration of pain-relieving drugs that might hasten death but\nalso as a justification for the practice known as terminal sedation or\ncontinuous sedation. This occurs when patients with terminal\nconditions who experience intractable pain that cannot be treated\neffectively with opioid or other analgesic drugs are treated with\nsedative drugs (which do not typically have analgesic properties) in\norder to induce unconsciousness. Artificial hydration and nutrition\nare not provided for patients sedated for these reasons in the context\nof palliative care at the end of life. If death is not already\nimminent for such a deeply sedated patient, dehydration and starvation\nwill make it inevitable. In such cases, withholding life-sustaining\ntreatment does in fact hasten death, intentionally but justifiably.\nProlonging the process of dying for a continuously sedated patient, in\nwhom sedation was initiated to deal with intractable pain, does not\nbenefit the patient.\n\nIn some cases, the patient\u2019s right to refuse life-sustaining\ntreatment, as expressed directly by the patient or through a proxy or\nan advance directive, is the justification for withholding artificial\nhydration and nutrition during terminal sedation. If a dying patient\nviews hastening death as a good to be pursued, then double\neffect\u2019s presumption that death is a harm that a physician may\nnot intend to bring about is at odds with the preferences of a patient\nwho rejects artificial hydration and nutrition in order to hasten\ndeath.\n\nTimothy E. Quill, M.D., Rebecca Dresser, J.D, and Dan W. Brock, Ph.D.\nargue that double effect, if applied consistently, would rule out the\npractice of terminal sedation. \u201cUnlike the use of high-dose\nopioids to relieve pain, with death as a possible but undesired side\neffect, terminal sedation inevitably causes death, which in many cases\nis what the patient desires. Although the overall goal of terminal\nsedation is to relieve otherwise uncontrollable suffering,\nlife-prolonging therapies are withdrawn with the intent of hastening\ndeath. Terminal sedation would thus not be permitted under the rule of\ndouble effect, even though it is usually considered acceptable\naccording to current legal and medical ethical standards\u201d\n(Quill, Dresser and Brock, 1997; see also Quill, Lo and Brock\n1997).\n\nThe belief that doctors can cite double effect reasoning to justify\nactions that hasten death tends to obscure rather than clarify these\nimportant issues in palliative care. A single principle is no\nsubstitute for the professional expertise of palliative care\nspecialists who seek to ensure a patient\u2019s comfort at the end of\nlife by using a variety of forms of care while respecting the\npatient\u2019s right to refuse even life-sustaining treatment.\nStandardized forms that invite patients with advanced chronic\nillnesses to specify in advance their Medical (or Physician)\nOrders regarding Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST or POLST form)\nallow patients to request or to reject various treatments that would\nextend their lives while also opting for forms of medical care that\nwill promote their comfort in dying (Bomba 2011). A physician\nproviding palliative care with the goal of promoting the\npatient\u2019s comfort might provide pain relief, supplemental oxygen\nor artificial hydration to a patient with the goal of increasing their\ncomfort, even when these treatments also have the effect of extending\nlife and prolonging the process of dying. The issues are complex and\ncannot be resolved with a single principle that endorses a single\nremedy. The compassionate ethos that the traditional application of\ndouble effect is often understood to express is a central commitment\nof palliative care, but the considerations to be taken into account go\nbeyond what could be explained by the principle of double effect.\n6. One principle or many loosely related exceptions to a general prohibition on causing grave harms?\n\nIt is not at all clear that all of the examples that double effect has\nbeen invoked to justify can be explained by a single principle, since\nthere may be a variety of considerations that bear on the\npermissibility of causing grave harms in particular contexts. Perhaps\nall of these cases have in common the feature that the agent acts to\npromote a good end in a permissible manner and regrets any harms that\nare involved. For some proponents of double effect, these facts are\nenough to show that the harms that are caused should be described as\nmerely foreseen side effects.\n\nCritics of the use of double effect as an explanatory principle point\nout that the proportionality condition is vague and too general,\nrequiring only that the good effect outweigh the foreseen bad effect\nor that there be sufficient reason for causing the bad effect. These\ncritics add that when substantive principles that explain the\npermissibility of causing the kind of harm in question are explicitly\nformulated, these principles are doing all of the justificatory work\n(Davis 1984; McIntyre 2001). These substantive considerations are not\nderived from double effect and in some cases do not support the\ntraditional applications of double effect. If this criticism is\ncorrect, then perhaps the cases that have traditionally been cited as\napplications of the principle of double effect are united only by the\nfact that each is an exception to the general prohibition on causing\nthe death of a human being.\n\nThe historical origins of the principle of double effect as a tenet of\nCatholic casuistry might explain the appearance that there is a single\nprinciple with diverse applications. If one were to assume that it is\nabsolutely prohibited to cause the death of a human being, then it\nwould be impermissible to kill an aggressor in self-defense, to\nsacrifice one\u2019s life to protect others, to hasten death as a\nside effect of administering sedation for intractable pain, to\nendanger non-combatants in warfare, to undertake risky surgery to save\na patient\u2019s life, to perform a hysterectomy on a pregnant woman\nin order to save her life, or to swerve the trolley. However, if one\nwere to assume instead that what is absolutely prohibited is to cause\nthe death of a human being intentionally, then these cases\ncan be viewed as cases in which one might permissibly cause death\nregretfully viewing the death as a \u201cmerely foreseen side\neffect\u201d of pursuing a good end.\n\nHowever, as we have seen, it is hard to make sense of the idea that\nthe soldier who throws himself on a grenade does not view his\nself-sacrifice as a means of protecting his fellow soldiers, or that\nthe physician who performs a hysterectomy on a pregnant woman does not\nsee the removal of the fetus as part of the life-saving procedure. It\nis true that we could emphasize the soldier\u2019s motive by talking\nabout what he intended: that his intention was not to cause his own\ndeath but to protect the lives of his fellow soldiers, or that the\nphysician who performs a hysterectomy on a pregnant woman to save her\nlife did not intend to kill the child, only to remove a cancerous\nuterus containing a fetus. But in the same way we could say of someone\nwho ended her life: her intention was not to kill herself but to bring\nher suffering to an end; and of someone who killed an enemy he\nsuspected of plotting against him that the did not intend to kill the\nenemy but instead intended to insure his own future security. This way\nof speaking amounts to saying that the harm that the agent caused was\nchosen as a means to the agent\u2019s end and was not\npursued for its own sake. But double effect is supposed to condemn,\nnot to justify, grave harms intended as a means to a good end.\n\nSome have developed this kind of criticism by arguing that the appeal\nof the principle of double effect is, fundamentally, illusory: an\nagent\u2019s intentions are not relevant to the permissibility of an\naction in the way that the proponents of the principle of double\neffect would claim, though an agent\u2019s intentions are relevant to\nmoral assessments of the way in which the agent deliberated (see\nMcCarthy 2002; Scanlon 2008). That an agent intended to bring about a\ncertain harm does not make an otherwise permissible action\nimpermissible, but it can explain what is morally faulty about the\nagent\u2019s reasoning in pursuing that line of action.\n",
