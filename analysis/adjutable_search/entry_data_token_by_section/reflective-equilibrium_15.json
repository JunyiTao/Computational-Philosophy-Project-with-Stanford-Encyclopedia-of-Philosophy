If you identify a problem\nwith someone\u2019s way of doing philosophy, and they agree that\nit\u2019s a problem, you might expect them to change how they do it.\nBut the adherent of wide reflective equilibrium accepts the criticism\nbut maintains their method, saying that they have adopted the\ncriticism within the method. To critics this suggests that the method\nis \u201cclose to vacuous\u201d (Singer 2005: 349), absorbing\nmethodological controversies rather than adjudicating them (McPherson\n2015: 661; Paulo 2020: 346; de Maagt 2017: 458). It just takes us\n\n\nback to the usual philosophical argument about the merits and demerits\nof various methods of argument and of various theories. The method of\nreflective equilibrium is then not a method in moral philosophy at\nall. (Raz 1982: 309)\n\n\nDefenders of wide reflective equilibrium describe it in similar terms\nto the critics, while rejecting their negative evaluation. Its ability\nto absorb apparent rivals is seen as a feature, not a bug:\n\n\nThis charge of emptiness seems to me to be largely correct, but\nnonetheless mistaken in one important respect, and therefore not as\ndamaging as it sounds. The charge is largely correct because the\nsearch for wide reflective equilibrium, as Rawls describes it, allows\nfor what might have been seen as alternative methods of justification\nto be incorporated within it. \u2026 What the method of reflective\nequilibrium prescribes is, so to speak, a level playing field of\nintuitive justification on which principles and judgments of all\nlevels of generality must compete for our allegiance. It thus allows\nall possible sources of justificatory force to be considered. But the\nmethod is not vacuous because it is incompatible with some views about\nthese sources. It is incompatible, first, with the idea that any\nparticular class of judgments or principles can be singled out in\nadvance of this process as justified on some other basis and, second,\nwith the idea that any class of considered judgments should be left\nout of this process. (Scanlon 2003: 151).\n\n\nIt might be added that critics of reflective equilibrium are rich\nsources of methods incompatible with reflective equilibrium. For\ninstance, Brandt\u2019s cognitive psychotherapy, Hare\u2019s\nuniversal prescriptivism, Anderson\u2019s pragmatism, or de\nMaagt\u2019s transcendentalism describe methods for justifying moral\nviews prior to, or without, reflective equilibrium (Brandt 1979; Hare\n1981; Anderson 2015; de Maagt 2017). Reflective equilibrium rules\nout\n\n\nmoral skepticism and nihilism and other doctrines that doubt our\ncapacities for morality altogether, as well as naturalism and other\nreductionist efforts to justify moral principles purely on the basis\nof factual, linguistic, or metaphysical claims. (Freeman 2007: 37; see\nalso Rawls 1971: 51)\n\n\nGiven the many methods and theories at odds with reflective\nequilibrium, it is hard to maintain that it is devoid of content, or\nnearly so. If it looks that way it may be because its assumptions are\nwidely accepted in moral and political philosophy, a victim of its own\nsuccess.\n",
