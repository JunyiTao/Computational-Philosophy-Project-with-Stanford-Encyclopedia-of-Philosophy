    "main_text": "\n\nThe Problem of Perception is a pervasive and traditional problem about\nour ordinary conception of perceptual experience. The problem is\ncreated by the phenomena of perceptual illusion and hallucination: if\nthese kinds of error are possible, how can perceptual experience be\nwhat we ordinarily understand it to be: something that enables direct\nperception of the world? These possibilities of error challenge the\nintelligibility of our ordinary conception of perceptual experience;\nthe major theories of experience are responses to this challenge.\n",
