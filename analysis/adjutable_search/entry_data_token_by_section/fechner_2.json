    "main_text": "The Breakdown\n3. The Breakdown\n\nThe most dramatic and fateful event in Fechner\u2019s life was his\nmental breakdown, which lasted for nearly four years, beginning in\nDecember 1839 and ending in October 1843. The breakdown was extremely\nsevere, leading to near death and loss of sanity. His mental and\nphysical collapse was the talk of Leipzig. No one expected Fechner to\ncome out of it. But, remarkably, he did. That he survived it at all,\nand then continued in a productive career, is astonishing. Fechner\nhimself regarded it as \u201ca miracle\u201d. \n\nFechner\u2019s breakdown was a watershed in his intellectual\ndevelopment. It forced him to reevaluate the orientation of his work.\nFrom now on, he would write on only what was important to him. No more\nhackwork. More importantly, during his recovery Fechner had a mystical\nexperience which it became his mission to spell out in philosophical\nprose. Some of Fechner\u2019s iconic works are the direct result of\nthis experience. \n\nThe story of the breakdown was told by Fechner himself in a memoir,\nentitled \u2018Krankheitsgeschichte\u2019, written in 1845\n(reproduced in Kuntze 1892: 106\u2013126). What follows are the\nhighlights of his story. \n\nIn the Autumn of 1839 the strain of overwork was beginning to take its\ntoll on Fechner. There were acute physical symptoms of mental stress.\nHe was suffering from headaches, insomnia and lethargy. But there were\nalso symptoms of neurosis. His thought was obsessive and compulsive.\nHe complained that his thinking was leading nowhere, that he would\nconstantly come back to the same point, that in doing so he was\nexhausting himself. It was impossible for him to stop thinking; he\ncould not relax or distract himself. Rather than he controlling his\nthinking, it was as if his thinking were controlling him. \n\nThe worst physical symptom of Fechner\u2019s growing illness was near\nblindness. He had strained his eyes doing his experimental work. He\nhad to look through colored glasses at the sun, so that images of\nbright objects would remain in his eyes. He also had to stare for long\nperiods at very fine measurement scales, which taxed his vision. His\nsight received \u201cits final blow\u201d in 1840. His eyes became\nso sensitive to light that he could not open them. He had to live in a\ncompletely darkened room and to wear a blindfold. Because of the\ndeterioration of his sight, he had to abandon reading and writing; and\nbecause he could not read or write, he could not work. His great enemy\nbecame boredom. All could have been bearable to him if he could only\nsleep; but his insomnia was relentless. \n\nThough Fechner could not read himself, someone could still read to\nhim. For a while, this was his only source of stimulation. His wife\nwould often read to him; so would a friend, who would visit him daily.\nThat friend was no less than the young Hermann Lotze, who was just\nthen beginning his writing career. But, eventually, even his visits\nhad to stop. Fechner could not bear the strain of listening. There\ncould be only complete silence in that darkened room.\n\nAnything that involved mental effort was now unbearable to Fechner.\nBecause even conversation was impossible for him, he avoided all\ncontact with others, even his wife. And so Fechner became completely\nisolated, from the world and others. He was utterly alone in that\nblack and silent room. \n\nDesperate, Fechner finally made the fateful decision to listen to his\ndoctors. They would attempt an experimental remedy from traditional\nChinese medicine. They would apply to his back moxa\u2014a down of\ndried leaves from the plant Artemisia moxa. The immediate\neffect was to create swellings, which left scars on his back; but the\nlong-term effect was much worse: digestion became impossible. Now\nFechner could not eat or drink; he quickly became emaciated. He was on\nthe brink of starvation. \n\nFechner was rescued from starvation by a woman who was acquainted with\nhis family. She had read of his illness, and dreamed of a remedy for\nit. She sent him pieces of dried ham, cleaned of all fat. To his\nsurprise, Fechner enjoyed eating it, and he gradually recovered his\nstrength through it. \n\nSome of the symptoms Fechner describes in the depths of his illness\nsound like schizophrenia. He complained that his thoughts were beyond\nhis control. They would arise from very incidental reasons and he\ncould not stop them. As he wrote of his state of mind: \u201cMy inner\nbeing divided itself into two parts: in my self and in my\nthoughts.\u201d (114)\n\nFechner later wrote that only two things prevented him from sinking\ninto complete oblivion: the care of his wife and his religious faith.\nHe was especially strengthened and comforted by the thought that there\nwas compensation in another life for the sorrows endured in this life.\nThese eschatological themes will later play a central role in his\ntheory of religion. \n\nThe worst month of his illness, Fechner later wrote, was August 1843.\nIt seemed he could not sink any further into depression, and that\nthere could be neither rescue nor redemption from all his suffering.\nBut, slowly and gradually, a process of recovery began in October. He\nfound that he could now speak without having unpleasant sensations,\nand that the more he spoke, the more he liked speaking. With\nself-confidence and prudence, his powers gradually strengthened. For a\nfew seconds, he could open his eyes without feeling any pain; he later\nfound that he could do this for longer moments. Fechner told himself\nthat he was not merely passive, that he had the power to exercise his\neyes, and that he could make them stronger. Eventually, he wrote, they\nfelt \u201ca real hunger for light\u201d. \n\nThus Fechner cured himself. It was as if it were all a question of\nwill power. He found a source of strength within himself, a power to\ngo out and meet the world. He now believed that he had allowed himself\nto sink into nothingness; if he was the source of his\nself-annihilation, he reasoned, he could also be the source of his\nself-affirmation. And so by Christmas of 1843, full of hope and\nconfidence, Fechner walked out of his dark night, a new man. He would\nbe a productive writer for the next forty four years.\n",
