    "main_text": "Paradoxes Resolved || Interference paradoxes\n10.2 Interference paradoxes\nThe best known of the interference paradoxes is the double\nslit. How can successive quantum particles passing through the slit\nsystem and later detected at specific points in the interference zone\nbuild up a pattern showing interference of a sort that depends on the\nseparation of the slits, even though measurements carried out directly\nbehind the slits will show that the particle passed through one or the\nother, but not both? Feynman\u2019s\ndiscussion (Feynman, Leighton, & Sands\n1965: Chapter 1, where two holes replace the two slits) is\nsuperb. What is essentially the same paradox, but in a form somewhat\neasier to analyze, is the one in which a particle passes through the\ntwo arms of Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Chapter 13\nof Griffiths (2002a) provides an\nextensive discussion of how the histories approach deals with\ndifferent possibilities in a consistent way that avoids paradoxes\nwhile producing analogs of all the interesting effects discussed by\nFeynman.\n",
