    "main_text": "Dreaming and the self\n4. Dreaming and the self\n\nWe almost always have a self in dreams, though this self can sometimes\nbe a slightly different (e.g. older or younger) version of our waking\nself or even a different person entirely. Dreams therefore raise\ninteresting questions about the identity between the dream and waking\nself. Locke (1689) invites us to imagine two men alternating in turns\nbetween sleep and wakefulness and sharing one continuously thinking\nsoul (Locke 1689: II.I.12). He argues that if one man retained no\nmemory of the soul\u2019s thoughts and perceptions while it was\nlinked to the other man\u2019s body, they would be distinct persons.\nHis position is that personal identity depends on psychological\ncontinuity, including recall: in the absence of recall, as illustrated\nby the toy example of two people sharing one soul, continuous\nconscious thinking does not suffice for identity. Locke also rejects\nthe possibility of unrecalled dreams and the idea that we dream\nthroughout sleep, remembering only a small proportion of our dreams\n(Locke 1689: II.I.19).\n\nValberg distinguishes between the subject of the dream (i.e., the\ndream self) and the sleeping person who is the dreamer of the dream\nand recalls it upon awakening (Valberg 2007). He argues that awakening\nfrom a dream involves crossing a chasm between discrete worlds with\ndiscrete spaces and times; it does not make sense to say that\n\u201cthe \u2018I\u2019 at these times [is] a single individual who\ncrosses from one world to the other\u201d (Valberg 2007: 69).\nAccording to Valberg, this is relevant to dream skepticism because\nthere is no simple way to make sense of the claims that it is I who\nemerge from a dream or that I was the victim of dream deception.\n\nVicarious dreams, or dreams in which the protagonist of the dream\nseems to be a different person from the dreamer, are particularly\npuzzling with respect to identity. They may even raise the question of\nwhether the dream self has an independent existence (Rosen &\nSutton 2013: 1047). Such dreams are superficially similar to cases in\nwhich we imagine being another person, but according to Rosen and\nSutton require a different explanation: in the case of dreaming, the\nimagined person\u2019s thoughts are not framed as diverging from\none\u2019s own and one does not retain one\u2019s own perspective in\naddition to the imagined one; in nonlucid dreams, only the perspective\nof the dream\u2019s protagonist is retained.\n\nThe dream self is also at the center of simulation views of dreaming,\nwhich define dreaming via its immersive, here and now character as the\nexperience of a self in a world. This leads to further questions about\nthe phenomenology of self-experience in dreams and how it is different\nfrom waking self-experience. Different versions of the simulation view\nfocus on different aspects of self- and world experience in dreams,\nranging from social simulation (Revonsuo et al. 2015) to the typical\nfeatures of selfhood in dreams (Revonsuo 2005, 2006, Metzinger 2003,\n2009) to the minimal conditions for experiencing oneself as a self in\ndreams and what this tells us about minimal phenomenal selfhood in\ngeneral (Windt 2015a, 2018). Yet these different versions of the\nsimulation view are largely complementary and together have forged\nunity in a field that was previously hampered by lack of agreement\nabout the definition of dreaming. They also integrate the philosophy\nof dreaming and scientific dream research.\n\nAs so often in debates about dreaming, there is disagreement about\nbasic phenomenological questions. Revonsuo (2005) describes\nself-experience including bodily experience in dreams as identical to\nwaking, whereas Metzinger (2003, 2009; see also Windt & Metzinger\n2007) argues that important layers of waking self-experience (such as\nautobiographical memory, agency, a stable first-person perspective,\nmetacognitive insight, and self-knowledge) are missing in nonlucid\ndreams. He argues this is due to the cognitive and mnemonic deficit\nthat characterizes nonlucid dreams (cf. Hobson et al. 2000). Windt\n(2015a) analyzes the range of cognitive and bodily self-experience in\ndreams, both of which she describes as variable. She argues that in a\nmajority of cases, dreams are weakly phenomenally embodied states in\nwhich bodily experience is largely related to movement sensations but\na detailed and integrated body representation is lacking; instead,\nbodily experience in dreams is largely indeterminate (for an attempt\nto test this empirically, see Koppehele-Gossel et al. 2016). She\nproposes this is because dreams are also weakly functionally embodied\nstates, in which the specific pattern of bodily experience reflects\naltered processing of bodily sensations (as in the illusion view). She\nalso analyzes instances of bodiless dreams, in which dreamers say they\nexperienced themselves as disembodied entities, to argue that\nself-experience can be reduced to pure spatiotemporal-self-location\n(Windt 2010); she proposes these cases can help identify the\nconditions for the emergence of minimal phenomenal selfhood (Blanke\n& Metzinger 2009; see also Metzinger 2013b).\n",
