    "main_text": "Pleasure, Motivation, and the Brain\n3. Pleasure, Motivation, and the Brain\n\nThe simple picture of pleasure as valuable and attractive due to its\nown experiential nature may survive the objections considered so far,\nat least as theoretical possibility. However, looking more closely at\nour experience of pleasure, its long-noted but variable connections to\nmotivation, and at the sciences studying these raises further\nquestions. Pleasure itself, or at least pleasure and forms of\nmotivation with which it is typically integrated and easily confused,\nmay come apart, on closer analysis. The search for true pleasure that\nis really as good as it seems, beyond taint of compulsive craving or\nbiological illusion, now continues in the studies of the brain. These\ngive us reason to think that, if there is some single experience of\ntrue pleasure, its relations to motivation may be more heterogeneous,\ncomplex, and contingent than naive versions of the simple picture,\nhedonism, and common sense supposed. But perhaps the deeper\nphilosophers and yogis knew this all along.\n",
