    "main_text": "Descriptivism and Reductivism\n2. Descriptivism and Reductivism\n\nThis section will look at two views closely associated with\nnaturalism, descriptivism and reductivism. Many philosophers who call\nthemselves descriptivists or reductivists also call themselves\nnaturalists (or at least end up taking the same side as self-described\nnaturalists in many metaethical debates). Perhaps we can usefully\ncharacterize naturalism in terms of either of these views.\n\nNaturalism as Descriptivism: Moral facts are natural\nfacts if and only if (and because) descriptivism is true.\n\nNaturalism as Reductivism: Moral facts are natural\nfacts if and only if (and because) reductivism is true.\n\nMore modestly, even if Naturalism as Descriptivism and Naturalism as\nReductivism don\u2019t pan out, we might prefer to just focus on\ndescriptivism or reductivism as interesting views that capture many of\nthe same ideas that incline philosophers toward naturalism.\n",
