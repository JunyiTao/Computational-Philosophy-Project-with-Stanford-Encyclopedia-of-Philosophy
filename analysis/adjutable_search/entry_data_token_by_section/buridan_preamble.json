    "main_text": "\n\n\nPerhaps the most influential Parisian philosopher of the fourteenth\ncentury, John Buridan did much to shape the way philosophy was done\nnot only during his own lifetime, but throughout the later scholastic\nand early modern periods.  He spent his entire career as a teaching\nmaster in the arts faculty at the University of Paris, lecturing on\nlogic and the works of Aristotle, and producing many commentaries and\nindependent treatises on logic, metaphysics, natural philosophy, and\nethics. His most famous work is the Summulae de dialectica\n(Compendium of Dialectic), a text of astonishing breadth and\noriginality aimed at redeeming the older tradition of Aristotelian\nlogic using the newer, terminist logic of \u2018moderns\u2019 such\nas Peter of Spain and William of Ockham.  Buridan applied these\nanalytical techniques so successfully in his metaphysics, natural\nphilosophy, and ethics that, for many of his successors, they came to be\nidentified with the method of philosophy, understood as\na secular practice, i.e., as distinct from theology.\n",
