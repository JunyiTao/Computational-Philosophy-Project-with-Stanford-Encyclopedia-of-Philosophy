According to most early direct realists (e.g., Ducasse 1952,\nSellars 1975), even when visually hallucinating a red apple on the\ntable, one does not directly see a private mental particular or a\nconstellation of mental qualities; rather one is having a visual\nexperience that is like an experience which is normally brought about\nwhen one actually sees a real red apple on the table. Direct realists,\nin other words, typically insist that such cases should not\nbe analyzed in terms of a perceiver standing in a certain perceptual\nrelation to a private mental object or quality. Rather the analysis\ninvolves only one particular, the perceiver herself, and her being in\ncertain sorts of (perceptual, experiential) states or conditions that\nare typically brought about under certain circumstances in which one\ngenuinely perceives something. In standard cases, when one is having a\nveridical perception, the experiential state of the perceiver is\nbrought about by the actual object of her perception, and the\nperceiver\u2019s state is qualitatively differentiated by the causal\ninfluences of the sensible properties of the public object. In\nnonstandard cases like in hallucinations and illusions,\nphenomenologically the same kinds of states are brought about by\ndifferent causal routes, and the qualitative differentiation of\none\u2019s experiential state in such non-veridical cases is the\nresult of deviant causal influences. (Pitcher 1970, p. 384)\n\nThis sort of analysis of experiences is sometimes known as\nadverbialism in the literature because in perceiving a red object one\nis said to be in a state of perceiving something \u201cred-ly.\u201d\nThe theoretical import of this way of talking is that perceiving\nsomething that is red is a manner of perceiving that object\nthat would be distinct from the manner of perceiving it if the object\nwere blue, in which case one would be perceiving it\n\u201cblue-ly.\u201d Similarly when one hallucinates a red object,\nthere is only one object, the perceiver who is sensing in a certain\nmanner, namely, red-ly. In other words, \u2018red\u2019 is said to\nqualify not a private object but rather a state or activity of a\nperson, that state being a manner of perceiving or sensing physical\nobjects that are\n red.[13]\n For our purposes, keeping up with the general naturalistic motivation\nbehind developing direct realist views, we can take adverbialism as an\nattempt to get rid of mysterious mental objects or qualities in favor\nof metaphysically less costly states or activities of persons or\nmanners of perceiving that qualify persons qua subjects of experience.\nSo a pain experience, for a direct realist, is a specific manner in\nwhich tissue damage is (somatosensorially) perceived in a bodily\nregion. When we report pain, we report the occurrence of experiences\nunderstood this way \u2014 adverbially.\n\nAdverbialism of this sort can be effectively combined with\nintentionalism or representationalism about experience (for more on\nthe connection between adverbialism and representationalism, see Kraut\n1982, and Lycan 1987a, 1987b). An adverbialist has to somehow\ncharacterize these ways or manners of sensing/perceiving for\ndistinguishing between them, and a natural way to do that is by\nappealing to the standard or canonical conditions under which those\nperceptual events are brought about (recall how direct realists want\nto handle a visual hallucination: one is having a visual experience\nthat is like an experience which is normally brought about when one\nactually sees a real red apple on the table). Thus it may be\nreasonable to argue that those canonical conditions are what the\nspecific perceptual events or activities of the persons\nrepresent. For instance, it is plausible to claim that a\nspecific perceptual activity constitutes the perception of red (= the\nperceptual event representing the instantiation of red) because it is\nthe kind of psychological event regularly (canonically) caused by red\nsurfaces \u2014 indeed one might expect that the psychophysics of\nsensory modalities would detail these canonical or standard conditions\nin objective terms. Although this maneuver is open to direct realists,\nit is optional. When one takes this option the result is pretty much a\nstrong form of representationalism \u2014 for which see next\nsection.\n\nThere are various technical difficulties with adverbialism, especially\nwhen dealing with phenomenologically complex overall experiences such\nas having three pains of different qualitative character\nsimultaneously occurring in three different locations in one\u2019s\nbody. It is not clear whether adverbialist approaches can successfully\ntie the appropriate manners corresponding to different qualities with\nthe right pains or tissue damage on different locations. (See Jackson\n1975, 1977 for a detailed criticism of this sort; Tye 1996a, pp.\n74\u201377, contains a useful summary.) Furthermore, even when one\nmight successfully get rid of mysterious mental objects like\nsense-data with this adverbialist move, it is not clear whether\nadverbialism might still lead to a form of property dualism according\nto which one is directly aware of certain (non-physical)\nphenomenological qualities instantiated by experiences realized by\nbrain states. These qualities seem to be required to explain how the\nmanners of different perceptual activities of a perceiver can be\ndifferentiated. \n\nThere are other sources of resistance to direct perceptual theories of\npain and other intransitive bodily sensations. Some objections stem\nfrom considerations about whether direct perceptual theories can give\nadequate accounts of perception in general, so are not specific to\ntheir treatment of pain. One of the most frequently discussed worries\nabout direct perceptual theories in general is whether they can do\njustice to the internalist intuition that perceptual experience is\nphenomenally rich and peculiar in a way that cannot be pushed back to\nthe extramental world. In the case of early direct realists like\nArmstrong and Pitcher, this worry is even more pressing since they\nwere cognitivist about perceptual experience in general; that is, they\nattempted to explain perception in terms of belief acquisition (or, in\nterms of acquisition of belief-like cognitive states). But beliefs\ndon\u2019t seem to have the right kind of phenomenology associated\nwith perceptual experiences and bodily sensations (see Everitt 1988\nand Grahek 1991 for this kind of criticism). As pointed out earlier,\nearly direct realists played down the importance of experiential\nphenomenology and sometimes even denied its existence fearing that\nacknowledging it will lead to the introduction of sense-data or\n\u201cirreducibly psychic\u201d\n qualia.[14]\n But this concern about qualia or phenomenology in general drove many\naway from the early direct perceptual theories (especially those who\nwere not much worried about skepticism and epistemology in general)\nwith the conviction that these theories are not adequate after all for\ncapturing the rich and robust phenomenology of perceptual\nexperiences.\n",
