Our knowledge\nforms a body, and that body has a structure: knowing some things\nrequires knowing other things. But what is this structure?\nEpistemologists who think that knowledge involves justification tend\nto regard the structure of our knowledge as deriving from the\nstructure of our justifications. We will, therefore, focus on the\nlatter.\n",
