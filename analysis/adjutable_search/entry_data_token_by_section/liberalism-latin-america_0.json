An Overview\n\nLiberal ideas first became widespread in Latin American with the\ninfluence of the liberal C\u00e1diz constitution of 1812 which\nwas in force in the Spanish empire for two years until the\nreestablishment of absolute rule. At the beginning of the century,\n\u201cliberalism\u201d in this context primarily meant what Spanish\nliberals meant by it in the debates that took place in the\nC\u00e1diz Courts, which met as a sovereign national assembly in\nresponse to the Napoleonic invasion of the Iberian peninsula in 1808.\nIt was in this setting that the term \u201cliberal\u201d was for the\nfirst time employed in a political sense to refer to a political group\n(Bre\u00f1a 2012). Since the C\u00e1diz constitution was, in turn,\nheavily influenced by the political ideas of the French Revolution,\nthe first liberal ideas in Latin America had likewise primarily this\norigin. Ideas such as popular sovereignty, civil equality, individual\nrepresentation, the conventional nature of political authority,\nfreedom of thought and of the press, and a division of powers that\nprivileges the legislative became central to early Latin American\nliberalism. The latter was by no means identical to Spanish liberalism\nor to the political ideas of the French revolution, but these two are\nits main initial sources.\n\nThe crisis of the Spanish and Portuguese monarchies upon the\nNapoleonic invasion set off the process of independence in most of\nLatin America and opened the way for the free circulation, for the\nfirst time, of modern political ideas in the region (the Spanish and\nPortuguese inquisitions had prohibited freedom of thought and of the\npress). Though the C\u00e1diz constitution was influential in both\nHispanic (i.e., Spanish-speaking) and Portuguese Americas, liberalism\ndeveloped in quite different directions in these two regions because\nof the two quite different ways in which the Spanish and Portuguese\nmonarchies responded to the French invasion. While the flight of the\nSpanish king tossed the empire into a political crisis, the Portuguese\nwere able to maintain political stability by transferring the capital\nof the empire to Brazil. Thus, questions about the source of\nlegitimate political authority became pressing in Hispanic America,\nbut were not as critical in Brazil. Although the initial answers that\nHispanic Americans offered were framed in terms of traditional\nscholastic political thinking, they soon began to appeal to the\npolitical ideas of the French revolution, specifically to the notion\nof popular sovereignty. According to the scholastic traditional view,\nsovereign authority rested on a pact between the king and its people,\nand in the absence of the king, sovereignty returned to the people. On\nthis traditional view, the sovereign authority of the king was limited\nby natural, divine, and teleological (i.e., common good)\nconsiderations. The transition to the modern conception of unlimited\nand indivisible popular sovereignty marked a radical break in the\npolitical thinking in the Spanish colonies. Similarly new and\nrevolutionary was the related conception of individual representation\nin a constituent assembly, as opposed to the traditional corporate\nrepresentation before the king, to which the American subjects were\nnever entitled.\n\nThe end result of this political process was the independence of all\nHispanic America (with the exception of Cuba and Puerto Rico) within\ntwo decades of the Napoleonic invasion through armed revolt. Brazil,\nby contrast, obtained independence in the same period without\nbloodshed when the Portuguese prince-regent proclaimed it. This\ndifference in the sequence of political events accounts for the fact\nthat the liberal ideology in Hispanic America was deeply committed to\ncarrying out a radical break with the colonial past while a salient\nfeature of Brazilian liberalism is the continuity of monarchical rule.\nWhile liberals in Hispanic American uniformly rejected monarchism and\nembraced a republican form of government (i.e., non-monarchical)\ngrounded on popular sovereignty, Brazilian liberalism remained\nmonarchical until the closing decades of the century. The\negalitarianism implicit in republicanism favored the abolition of\nslavery and of noble titles in the new republics. By mid-century\nslavery had been formally abolished in all of them, though practices\nof slave/serf-like labor continued in some regions, such as\nMexico. In Brazil, slavery was finally abolished in 1888 after\ndecades of contestation and gradual decline.\n\nAfter having embraced the doctrine of popular sovereignty and the\nnatural rights language of the French revolution, most liberals\nfollowed Benjamin Constant in his critique of the doctrine of popular\nsovereignty and his defense of a limited government. His writings on\nconstitutionalism were closely followed in the design of Latin\nAmerican constitutions, both liberal and conservative. Though French\nliberalism exerted the greatest influence overall, some Latin American\nliberals were also much influenced by British parliamentarism. Most of\nthem also admired the North American republican experience.\nMontesquieu and Jeremy Bentham were, along with Constant, among the\nmost cited European authors in the first half of the century (Safford\n1987: 68). From Montesquieu, liberals took the idea of separation of\npowers and his critique of despotism. Though they did not adopt an\nexplicitly utilitarian language, they admired and followed\nBentham\u2019s rationalistic approach to legislation (Jaramillo 2001:\n120). In the mid-century, the political problem that came into focus\nand that gave liberals an identity against the conservative opposition\nwas the religious one. The question was how to deal with a powerful\nChurch that, in some regions, posed the most powerful internal\nchallenge to the authority of the newly established republics, given\nthe Catholic uncompromising rejection of liberalism. The Catholic\nChurch had condemned liberalism, secularism, freedom of thought and\ntoleration, among other \u201cevils\u201d in Pope Pius IX\u2019s\nSyllabus of Errors published in 1864. Liberals demanded freedom of\nreligious worship and, in some cases, the separation of church and\nstate. At this point in time, they had for the most part distanced\nthemselves from the natural rights discourse and from contractualism\nin light of the criticisms by the British utilitarians (especially\nBentham) and French liberals (especially Constant). They turned their\nattention to the German historical school of law (Friedrich Karl von\nSavigny and his French follower Eug\u00e8ne Lerminier) and, above\nall, to Auguste Comte\u2019s positivism, which became the most\ninfluential philosophical doctrine (Hale 1984) along with Herbert\nSpencer\u2019s evolutionism. After decades of civil unrest, a\ndoctrine that emphasized the maintenance of order in combination with\nprogress appeared highly attractive. Liberalism had ceased to be an\nideology in combat against an enemy, either foreign (Spain) or\ninternal (the conservative political faction), and had become the\ntriumphant ideology of national building (Hale 1984). In the closing\ndecades of the century, positivism displaced liberalism in Brazil,\nwhile some Hispanic American liberals carried out a synthesis of\nliberal ideas and positivism that has often been considered the\ndecline of liberalism.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, Latin American liberalism became the\nsubject of strong criticisms. Critics argued that Latin American\nsocieties had not been successfully transformed according to liberal\nideas because the former provided a hostile ground for the latter. On\nthis view, liberalism was a foreign ideology that was not adequate for\nHispanic American realities. This is a criticism against nineteenth\ncentury liberalism that has remained forceful to this date. By\nmid-twentieth century liberalism had been displaced by the emergence\nof alternative political movements and ideologies:\ncorporativisms of various sorts as well as socialist,\nMarxist, indigenous, agrarian, and populist. In the late twentieth and\nearly twenty-first centuries, liberalism has experienced a modest\nrevival in political discourse in Latin America. This is manifest in\nthe discourse that affirms the pluralism of forms of life and the\ndemands for protection of the rights of minorities. In the sphere of\nacademia, the works by English speaking liberal scholars, such as John\nRawls, Ronald Dworkin, and Joseph Raz, have received much attention\nand have been amply discussed in academic publications. However, Latin\nAmerican scholars have so far not related their current endorsement of\nrecent Anglo-American liberalism to the nineteenth century Latin\nAmerican liberal discourse. For the most part there is a sharp divide\nbetween current work by historians on nineteenth century Latin\nAmerican liberalism, on the one hand, and systematic reflection by\nphilosophers and political theorists on recent Anglo-American\nliberalism, on the other.\n",
