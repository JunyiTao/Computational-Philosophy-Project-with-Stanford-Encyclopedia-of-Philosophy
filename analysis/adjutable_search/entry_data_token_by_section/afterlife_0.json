    "main_text": "Survival and its Alternatives\n1. Survival and its Alternatives\n\nIn ancient Western philosophy, Plato affirmed both a pre-natal life of\nthe soul and the soul\u2019s continued life after the death of the\nbody. In Plato\u2019s Phaedo, Socrates presents reasons why\na philosopher should even welcome death (albeit not permitting or\nencouraging suicide), because of its emancipation of the souls of\nthose who are good in this life to a great afterlife. In the work of\nEpictetus, on the other hand, death is conceived of as a\nperson\u2019s ceasing to be. Epictetus does not argue that we should\nwelcome death but he holds that we should not fear death because we\nwill not exist after death. The philosophical assessment of the truth\nof such matters continues on to the present, as does debate on the\nimplications of whether we may survive death. Why?\n\nThere are many reasons why there should be ongoing attention as to\nwhether Plato or Epictetus\u2014or any other philosopher who offers a\ndifferent account about the reality or illusion of an\nafterlife\u2014is right. One reason is that the values we have in the\nhere and now have a bearing on what we may or should hope for in terms\nof the future. While some philosophers believe that what happens in\nthe future has enormous consequences for life\u2019s meaning now,\nother philosophers have so focused on the importance of the present\nthat questions about the future of humanity in this life, and the\npossible good or ill of an afterlife for individuals, is of little\nimportance. Consider two philosophers who take the latter position,\nPeter Singer and Erik Wielenberg.\n\nSinger asks us to consider a case when some good act is done and its\ngoodness does not depend upon the future. Imagine a village where\nthere is great need and that need is met with aid. Singer claims that\nthe goodness of such an act should not depend on the long term; one\ncan place to one side speculation about what might happen a thousand\nyears later.\n\n\nSuppose that we become involved in a project to help a small community\nin a developing country to become free of debt and self-sufficient in\nfood. The project is an outstanding success, and the villagers are\nhealthier, happier, better educated, and economically secure and have\nfewer children. Now someone might say \u201cwhat good have you done?\nIn a thousand years people will all be dead, and their children and\ngrandchildren as well, and nothing that you have done will make any\ndifference\u201d. (Singer 1993: 274) \n\n\nSinger responds: \n\n\nWe should not, however, think of our efforts as wasted unless they\nendure forever, or even for a very long time. (1993: 274) \n\n\nHis solution is to think of the universe in four-dimensional terms;\naccording to this philosophy of time, all times are equally real. On\nthis view, it is always the case that in the year 2020, the lives of\nthe villagers are made better; they are happy, healthy, and well\neducated in 2020. \n\nErik Wielenberg does not adopt Singer\u2019s recourse to the\nphilosophy of time but, like Singer, his counsel is that we should not\nthink (or need not think) in terms of the big picture or the future in\nassessing the meaning and urgency of our current projects\n\n\nIsn\u2019t it better that the Nazi Holocaust ended when it did rather\nthan in, say, 1970\u2014regardless of what the world will be like a\nmillion years from now? I can remember occasions in junior high gym\nclass when a basketball or volleyball game became particularly heated\nand adolescent tempers flared. Our gym teacher sometimes attempted to\ncalm us down with such rhetorical questions as, \u201cTen years from\nnow, will any of you care who won this game?\u201d It always struck\nme that a reasonable response to such a query would be, \u201cDoes it\nreally matter now whether any of us will care in ten years?\u201d In\nmuch the same vein, Thomas Nagel suggests, \u201cit does not matter\nnow that in a million years nothing we do now will matter\u201d.\n(2013: 345)\n\n\nA possible response is that while there is some wisdom in\nSinger\u2019s and Wielenberg\u2019s positions, they should not\ndissuade us from appreciating that the natural trajectory of the love\nof people and wisdom (or philosophy) includes concern for \u201cthe\nbig picture\u201d. If Singer truly cares about the villagers,\nshouldn\u2019t he hope that they survive to enjoy the fruits of the\ninvestments that have been made? Or, putting this in four-dimensional\ntime terms; shouldn\u2019t he wish that they are happy in 2030 and\n2040\u2026? Surely those providing aid are not (and should not be)\nindifferent about the future. Granted, if the investment was made and\nthen a meteor struck the village, destroying all life (or if in 2030\nthe meteor is destroying the village), we might well think the\ninvestment was still wise, good and noble (especially if there were no\npredictions of a meteor strike). However, there would be something\ndeeply disturbing if one of the aid-givers announced upon leaving the\nvillage: \n\n\nNo matter what happens, no matter whether you all are struck by a\nmassive plague in an hour and all die a horrible death or whether a\nthousand years from now your society will be condemned as deserving of\nnothing but contempt, what we have done today is our only concern and\nthe value of our act is not diminished regardless of what awaits you!\n\n\n\nWe suggest that this attitude would be bizarre. Returning to the\nquestion of the afterlife, if you think that some good afterlife is\npossible, one should hope for the long-term flourishing of the\nvillagers in both this life and the next rather than focusing only on\nthe value of their present position. And if you do have such a hope,\nwhy hope that the lives of everyone will come to an end at a specific\ntime, say in a thousand years? Similarly, if you believe that it is\nlikely or even possible that there is an afterlife where there is\ngreat ongoing harm, should we not hope that this not be the case for\nthe villagers?\n\nWielenberg\u2019s comments on the Holocaust are puzzling. Of course,\nno one except a murderous, psychopathic Nazi would hope the Holocaust\nlasted longer or that it involved the death of even one more\nindividual. But what one hopes will take place a million years from\nnow is not irrelevant ethically or in terms of values. Consider two\nfutures: in one, the Jews survive a million years from now and are\nthriving. In another, imagine that a million years from now there is a\nrevival of the Nazi party. The Jews have colonized Mars and Nazi\ngenocidal units are dispatched to treat Jewish settlements the way the\nNazis treated the Warsaw Ghetto in 1940. This time, the Nazis succeed\nin annihilating every last Jew. Surely, it would be deeply perverse to\nhope for the second future. It would also be perverse to be\nindifferent now about whether the second will occur. We cannot imagine\nthat a person of integrity would say they are utterly indifferent\nabout whether all Jews will be annihilated by Nazis in the future, be\nit a million years, ten million, twenty, or\u2026.\n\nNagel\u2019s comment (cited by Wielenberg) is worthy of note. His\ncomment suggests that what we do now will (or may) not matter a\nmillion years from now, but there is an important distinction between\nwhether some event matters (in the sense that it is valuable; it is\ngood that the event occurred) and whether persons who live in the\nfuture are aware of the event and care about it. Arguably, it will\nalways be the case that the Holocaust should not have happened,\nregardless of whether any human being remembers it a hundred (or a\nthousand or a million) years from now. Moreover, those of us who are\nhorrified about this genocide should hope that remembering it and\npassing on a record of it has no statute of limitation. In keeping\nwith our earlier thought experiment, imagine two futures: a million\nyears from now, persons recall the Holocaust and continue to lament\nthis mass genocide; in a different future imagine persons are all\nNazis and they only recall the Holocaust as a failure to succeed in\nkilling all Jews, something they were only able to achieve in the year\n1,002,014.\n\nSo, one reason why the topic of an afterlife is of historical and\ncontemporary interest is because our values about present persons,\nthings, and events have a bearing on the future, including the\npossibility of a future for individuals after their death. If we know\nthat it is impossible for individual persons to survive biological\ndeath, speculation on an afterlife we might expect or hope for would\nbe pointless (unless it serves some purpose in terms of fiction), but\nit would not be pointless to reflect on whether the impossibility of\nan afterlife should dominate our values in this life. What are the\nimplications for our lives now if we take seriously the idea that at\ndeath we will pass into oblivion? Some philosophers adopt a strategy\nlike Singer\u2019s and Wielenberg\u2019s about our individual lives.\nIn Religion Without God Ronald Dworkin is candid about\n\u201cwhat we desperately dread\u201d, namely \u201cthe total,\nobliterating, itself unimaginable, snuffing out of everything\u201d\n(2013: 150). While he thinks some kind of individual afterlife may be\npossible (even given atheistic naturalism) he does propose a\n\u201ckind of immortality\u201d which is \u201cthe only kind we\nhave any business wanting\u201d (Dworkin 2013: 159).\n\n\nWhen you do something smaller well\u2014play a tune or a part or a\nhand, throw a curve or a compliment, make a chair or a sonnet or\nlove\u2014your satisfaction is complete in itself. Those are\nachievements within life. Why can\u2019t a life also be an\nachievement complete in itself, with its own value in the art in\nliving it displays? (Dworkin 2013: 158)\n\n\nWho would deny that such acts can be great achievements? If\nindividual survival of death is impossible, then Dworkin is right to\ncast aside (as he does) the comedian Woody Allen\u2019s aspiration to\nlive on forever, not in his work, but in his apartment. But do we know\nthat an individual afterlife is impossible? Later in this entry, we\nsuggest that ruling out an afterlife as impossible is philosophically\ntenuous.  Moreover, we suggest that the goods within the life that\nDworkin describes invite us to consider whether human lives may be\nricher still if they do not end in oblivion and instead death marks a\ntransition to a form of afterlife that some of the world religions\nenvision. For an interesting secular case that many of our values in\nthe present moment are tied to expectations of the future, see\nScheffler 2016 (N.B. Scheffler is concerned with future events in this\nlife rather than an individual\u2019s life after their death.) For\nmore recent reflection on the relevance of an afterlife for the\nmeaning of life now, see Mawson 2019 and 2020.\n\nSo, we suggest that the topic of an afterlife is warranted for at\nleast three reasons: it is important if you love persons in this life\nand hope for their enduring flourishing (or hope they are not\nannihilated or meet a worse fate); it is important to think about the\nimplications of there not being an afterlife (or there being one) in\nterms of how to understand what is important to you now; and it is\nimportant to consider for historical reasons: speculation and beliefs\nabout life after death have existed through much of human history.\n\nIn most cultures, there is evidence of a belief in some sort of\npersonal afterlife, in which the same individual that lived and died\nnevertheless persists and continues to have new experiences. There are\nalternatives, however. The ancient Greeks are noted for having placed\na high premium on \u201csurvival\u201d in the memory and honor of\nthe community\u2014a practice reflected in our reference to deceased\ncelebrities as (for example) \u201cthe immortal Babe Ruth\u201d.\n(Strictly speaking, this for the Greeks was not a replacement for a\npersonal afterlife, but rather a supplement to what was conceived as a\nrather colorless and unrewarding existence in Hades.) Such a hope, it\nwould seem, provides a major consolation only if one is optimistic\nconcerning the persistence and continued memory of the community, as\nwell as the accuracy and justice of their judgments. An interesting\nvariant of this form of immorality is found in process theology, with\nits promise of \u201cobjective immortality\u201d in the mind of God,\nwho neither forgets nor misjudges the lives he remembers (Hartshorne\n1962: 262). Hindu and Buddhist traditions include a belief in\nreincarnation. Hindu philosophical tradition gives more credence to\nthe enduring of individuals through successive rebirths and deaths\nthan does Buddhist philosophical tradition see Knine 2010). In\nBuddhist philosophy, the ongoing task is to produce a sufficient\nconsciousness of the self for there to be reincarnation, while\nsimultaneously securing the understanding that the individual self is\nnot (in the end) a substantial, concrete thing, but a delusion that\nwill dissolve or become liberated into Nirvana (see Nattier 2010).\n\n\nOther entries in this encyclopedia address themes in Hindu and\nBuddhist philosophy (see, e.g., the entry on\nmind in Indian Buddhist philosophy),\nso we will forego a comparative study here of\ncompeting religious portraits of an afterlife. For two immensely\nvaluable resources for reflection on the afterlife from diverse\nreligious and philosophical perspectives, see The Palgrave Handbook of\nthe Afterlife (Nagasawa & Matheson eds. 2017) and The\nOxford Handbook to the Eschaton (Walls ed. 2010). A fascinating\nsynthesis of different religious portraits of an afterlife is\ndeveloped in Hick 1976. We also note, but do\nnot comment on, an important topic in Christian philosophical theology\nconcerning universalism, the belief that, eventually, all persons will\nbe saved (see Parry and Partridge 2003).\n\nOur focus for much of the rest of this\nentry is on the possibility and the reasonability of believing there\nis an afterlife for individual persons, though we will offer some\nobservations along the way about the kinds of afterlife that are\npossible, given different metaphysical assumptions. As for the\nphilosophers like Kierkegaard and Becker, cited earlier, who castigate\nthose of us who ignore our mortality, we suggest that sometimes the\ncontemplation of mortality can be disabling and distract us from\nseeking immediate goods (such as those Dworkin highlights) or\nrelieving suffering. It would not be admirable for the aid workers in\nSinger\u2019s example to pause in their work in order to hold\ndeath-and-dying seminars. However, while there might be nothing wrong\nin living without wrestling with mortality, there are sufficient good\nreasons why the topics of the nature of death and the existence (or\nnon-existence) of an afterlife are philosophically interesting and\ndeserving of attention.\n\nAs we turn to the question of whether it is possible for persons to\nsurvive death, it is natural to pursue an answer in light of the\nphilosophy of human persons. The next section considers survival from\nthe standpoint of mind-body dualism.\n",
