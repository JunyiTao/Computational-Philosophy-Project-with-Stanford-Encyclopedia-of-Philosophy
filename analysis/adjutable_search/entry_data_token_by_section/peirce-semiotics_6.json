    "main_text": "Peirce\u2019s Early Account: 1867\u20138. || Infinite Semiosis\n2.2 Infinite Semiosis\n\nAs previously noted, part and parcel of Peirce\u2019s early account of\nsigns is that an infinity of further signs both proceed and precede\nfrom any given sign. This is a consequence of the way Peirce thinks of\nthe elements of signs at this early stage and seems to stem from his\nidea that interpretants are to count as further signs, and signs are\ninterpretants of earlier signs. Since any sign must determine an\ninterpretant in order to count as a sign, and interpretants are\nthemselves signs, infinite chains of signs seem to become conceptually\nnecessary.\n\nTo see this, imagine a chain of signs with either a first or a last\nsign. The final sign that terminates the semiotic process will have no\ninterpretant; if it did, that interpretant would function as a further\nsign and generate a further interpretant, and the final sign would, in\nfact, not terminate the process. However, since any sign must\ndetermine an interpretant to count as a sign, the final sign would not\nbe a sign unless it had an interpretant. Similarly, a first sign could\nnot be the interpretant of a preceding sign. If it were, that previous\nsign would be the first sign. However, since any sign must be an\ninterpretant of a previous sign, a first sign would not be a sign\nunless it was also an interpretant of a previous sign. The problem is\nthat if we allow a final sign with no interpretant, or a first sign\nwhich is not the interpretant or some earlier sign, then we have\nfailed signs in the semiotic process. This affects the rest of the\nsemiotic chain causing something like a collapse of dominoes. For\nexample, if the final sign fails to be a sign in virtue of generating\nno interpretant, then since that failed sign is supposed to act as the\ninterpretant of the previous sign and function as a further sign in\nits own right, it has also failed to be an interpretant. The\nconsequence of this is that the previous sign has failed to generate a\nproper interpretant and so failed to be a sign. The consequence of\nthis is that\u2026and so on. The alternative is not to countenance\nterminating signs. And obviously, if we cannot end the semiotic\nprocess then signs continue generating signs ad infinitum.\n\nPeirce was both aware and untroubled by infinite semiosis. In part,\nthis is due to the anti-Cartesian project carried out in Peirce\u2019s work\nin the 1860s. A significant part of this project for Peirce is the\ndenial of intuitions, something that Peirce took as a key assumption\nof Cartesian philosophical method. Given that Peirce defines\n\u201cintuition\u201d as \u201ca cognition not determined by a\nprevious cognition of the same object\u201d (W2. 193), it seems clear\nthat the infinite procession of thought-signs generated by earlier\nthought-signs and in turn generating further thought-signs is part and\nparcel of the denial of intuitions. However, in later developments to\nhis sign theory, despite never explicitly relinquishing infinite\nsemiosis, many of the concepts that lead to it are replaced or\nrevised, and the concept becomes less prominent in Peirce\u2019s\nwork. (See Atkin 2015, 132\u2013135) for more on the anti-Cartesian\nmotivation of Peirce\u2019s early account of signs).\n",
