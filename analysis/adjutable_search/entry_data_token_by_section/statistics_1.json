Foundations and interpretations\n While there is large variation in how statistical procedures and\ninferences are organized, they all agree on the use of modern\nmeasure-theoretic probability theory (Kolmogorov ), or a near\nkin, as the means to express hypotheses and relate them to data. By\nitself, a probability function is simply a particular kind of\nmathematical function, used to express the measure of a set\n(cf. Billingsley 1995). \nLet \\(W\\) be a set with elements \\(s\\), and consider an initial\ncollection of subsets of \\(W\\), e.g., the singleton sets \\(\\{ s\n\\}\\). Now consider the operation of taking the complement \\(\\bar{R}\\)\nof a given set \\(R\\): the complement \\(\\bar{R}\\) contains exactly and\nall those \\(s\\) that are not included in \\(R\\). Next consider the join\n\\(R \\cup Q\\) given sets \\(R\\) and \\(Q\\): an element \\(s\\) is a member\nof \\(R \\cup Q\\) precisely when it is a member of \\(R\\), \\(Q\\), or\nboth. The collection of sets generated by the operations of complement\nand join is called an\nalgebra, denoted \\(S\\). In statistics we interpret \\(S\\) as\nthe set of samples, and we can associate sets \\(R\\) with specific\nevents or observations. A specific sample \\(s\\) includes a record of\nthe event denoted with \\(R\\) exactly when \\(s \\in R\\). We take the\nalgebra of sets like \\(R\\) as a language for making claims about the\nsamples.\nA probability function is defined as an additive\nnormalized measure over the algebra: a function\n\n    \\[ P: {\\cal S} \\rightarrow [0, 1] \\]  \n\nsuch that \\(P(R \\cup Q) = P(R) + P(Q)\\) if \\(R \\cap Q = \\emptyset\\)\nand \\(P(W) = 1\\). The conditional probability \\(P(Q \\mid R)\\)\nis defined as\n\n\\[ P(Q \\mid R) \\; = \\; \\frac{P(Q \\cap R)}{P(R)} , \\]\n\nwhenever \\(P(R) > 0\\). It determines the relative size of the set\n\\(Q\\) within the set \\(R\\). It is often read as the probability of the\nevent \\(Q\\) given that the event \\(R\\) occurs. Recall that\nthe set \\(R\\) consists of all samples \\(s\\) that include a record of\nthe event associated with \\(R\\). By looking at \\(P(Q \\mid R)\\) we zoom\nin on the probability function within this set \\(R\\), i.e., we\nconsider the condition that the associated event occurs.\nNow what does the probability function mean? The mathematical\nnotion of probability does not provide an answer.  The function \\(P\\)\nmay be interpreted as\n\nphysical, namely the frequency or propensity of the\noccurrence of a state of affairs, often referred to as the chance, or\nelse as \nepistemic, namely the degree of belief in the\noccurrence of the state of affairs, the willingness to act on its\nassumption, a degree of support or confirmation, or\nsimilar.\n\n This distinction should not be confused with that between\nobjective and subjective probability. Both physical and epistemic\nprobability can be given an objective and subjective character, in the\nsense that both can be taken as dependent or independent of a\nknowing subject and her conceptual apparatus. For more details on the\ninterpretation of probability, the reader is invited to consult\nGalavotti (2005), Gillies (2000), Mellor (2005), von Plato (1994), the\nanthology by Eagle (2010), the handbook of Hajek and Hitchcock\n(forthcoming), or indeed the entry on \n interpretations of probability.\nIn this context the key point is that the interpretations can all be\nconnected to foundational programmes for statistical\nprocedures. Although the match is not exact, the two major types\nspecified above can be associated with the two major theories of\nstatistics, classical and Bayesian statistics, respectively.\n",
