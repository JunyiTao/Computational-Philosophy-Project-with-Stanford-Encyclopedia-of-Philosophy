Acquiring knowledge for language\nWe have noted the dependence of language understanding and use on vast\namounts of shallow and deep knowledge, about the world, about lexical\nand phrasal meaning, and about discourse and dialogue structure and\nconventions. If machines are to become linguistically competent, we\nneed to impart this knowledge to them.\nIdeally, the initial, preprogrammed knowledge of a machine would be\nrestricted to the kinds of human knowledge thought to be innate (e.g.,\nobject persistence, motion continuity, basic models of animacy and\nmind, linguistic universals, means of classifying/taxonomizing the\nworld, of organizing events in time, of abstracting from experience,\nand other such knowledge and know-how). The rest would be learned in\nhuman-like fashion. Unfortunately, we do not have embodied agents with\nhuman-like sensory and motor equipment or human-like innate mental\ncapabilities; so apart from the simplest sort of verbal learning by\nrobots such as verbal labeling of objects or actions, or using spatial\nprepositions or two-word sentences (e.g.,\nFleischman and Roy 2005;\nMcClain and Levinson 2007; Cour et al.\n2008), most current work on\nknowledge acquisition uses either (1) hand-coding,\n(2) knowledge\nextraction from text corpora, or (3) crowdsourcing coupled with some\nmethod of converting collected, verbally expressed \u201cfacts\u201d to a usable\nformat. We focus in this section on the acquisition of general\nbackground knowledge needed to support language understanding and\nproduction, leaving discussion of linguistic knowledge acquisition to\nsection 9.\n",
