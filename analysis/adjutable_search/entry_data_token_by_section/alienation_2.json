    "main_text": "The Basic Idea || Modesty Of\n1.3 Modesty Of\n\nThis basic idea of alienation appears to give us a diverse but\ndistinct set of social and psychological phenomena; picking out a\nclass of entities which might have little in common other than this\nproblematic separation of subject and object. The problematic\nseparations here are between the self (including individual and\ncollective agents) and other (including other selves, one\u2019s own\nself, and entities which are not subjects). So understood, the basic\nidea of alienation seems to play largely a diagnostic or critical\nrole; that is, the problematic separations might indicate that\nsomething is awry with the self or social world, but do not, in\nthemselves, offer an explanation of, or suggest a solution to, those\nills. \n\nOn this account, the basic idea of alienation looks conceptually\nrather modest. In particular, this idea is not necessarily committed\nto certain stronger claims that might sometimes be found in the\nliterature. That all these social and psychological ills are\ncharacterised by a problematic separation, for example, does not make\nalienation a natural kind, anymore than\u2014to borrow an example\nassociated with John Stuart Mill\u2014the class of white objects is a\nnatural kind (Wood 2004: 4). Nor, for instance, need there be any\nsuggestion that the various forms of alienation identified by this\naccount are necessarily related to each other; that, for example, they\nare all explained by the same underlying factor. Of course, particular\ntheorists may have constructed\u2014more or less\nplausible\u2014accounts of alienation that do advance those, or\nsimilar, stronger claims. For instance, the young Karl Marx\n(1818\u20131883) is often understood to have suggested that one of\nthe systematic forms of alienation somehow explains all the other ones\n(Wood 2004: 4). The claim here is simply that these, and other,\nstronger claims are not required by the basic idea.\n\nThat said, the basic idea of alienation appears to require only a few\nadditions in order to extend its critical reach significantly.\nConsider two further suggestions often made in this context: that\nalienation picks out an array of non-trivial social and psychological\nills that are prevalent in modern liberal societies; and that the idea\nof \u2018alienation\u2019 is distinct from that of\n\u2018injustice\u2019 on which much modern liberal political\nphilosophy is focused. These familiar claims are not extravagant, but,\nso understood, the concept of alienation would appear to have some\ncritical purchase on both contemporary liberal societies (for\ncontaining alienation) and contemporary liberal political philosophy\n(for neglecting alienation). The implied critical\nsuggestion\u2014that the concept of alienation reveals that something\nsignificant is awry with both liberal society and liberal\nunderstandings\u2014looks far from trivial. (Of course, establishing\nthat those purported failings reveal fundamental flaws in either\nliberal society, or liberal political philosophy, is rather harder to\naccomplish.)\n\nParticular theories of alienation typically restrict the range of\nproblematic separations that they are interested in, and introduce\nmore explanatory accounts of the extent and prognosis of alienation so\ncharacterised. They might, for instance, focus on social rather than\npsychological ills, and maintain that these are caused by certain\nstructural features\u2014particular aspects of its economic\narrangements, for instance\u2014of the relevant society. Such\nexplanatory claims are of considerable interest. After all,\nunderstanding the cause of a problem looks like a helpful step towards\nworking out whether, and how, it might be alleviated or overcome.\nHowever, these explanatory claims are not readily open to general\ndiscussion, given the significant disagreements between particular\nthinkers and traditions that exist in this context. Note also that\nintroducing these various restrictions of scope, and various competing\nexplanatory claims, increases the complexity of the relevant account.\nHowever, these complexities alone scarcely explain the\u2014somewhat\nundeserved\u2014reputation that the concept of alienation has for\nbeing unduly difficult or elusive. It might be that their impact is\ncompounded\u2014at least in the intellectual traditions with which\nthe concept of alienation is most often associated (Hegelianism and\nMarxism)\u2014by language and argumentative structures that are\nunfamiliar to some modern readers.\n",
