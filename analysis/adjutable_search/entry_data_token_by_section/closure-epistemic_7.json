    "main_text": "The Argument From Not (Easily) Knowable Propositions\n4. The Argument From Not (Easily) Knowable Propositions\n\nAnother anticlosure argument is that there are some sorts of\npropositions we cannot know unless perhaps we take extraordinary\nmeasures, yet such propositions are entailed by mundane claims whose\ntruth we do know. Since this would be impossible if K were\ncorrect, K must be false. The same difficulty is sometimes\ndiscussed under the heading problem of easy knowledge, since\nsome theorists (Cohen 2002) believe that certain things are difficult\nto know, in the sense that they cannot be known by deduction from\nbanal knowledge. The argument has different versions depending on\nwhich propositions are said to be hard knowledge. According to Dretske\n(and perhaps Nozick as well), we cannot easily know that limiting\npropositions or heavyweight propositions are true. These\nresemble propositions Moore (1959) considered certainly true and that\nWittgenstein (1969) declared to be unknowable (but Wittgenstein\nconsidered them unknowable on the dubious grounds that they must be\ntrue if we are to entertain doubts). Another possibility is that we\ncannot easily know lottery propositions. A special case of\nthe argument from unknowable propositions starts with the claim that\nwe cannot know the falsity of skeptical hypotheses. We will consider\nthis third view in the next section.\n",
