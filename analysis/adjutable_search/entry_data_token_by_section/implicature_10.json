Neo-Gricean Pragmatics\n\nProminent linguists have sought to improve on Grice\u2019s\nformulation of the conversational principles, and provide a solution\nto the problem of clashes. Horn (2004: \u00a74) replaces Quantity,\nRelevance, and Manner with two interrelated\n principles.[48]\n\n\nQ Principle: Say as much as you can [given Quality\nand R].\n\nR Principle: Say no more than you must [given Q].\n\n\nLevinson (2000: 76, 114, 137) adopts similar principles, which he\ncalls \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cI\u201d (for\n \u201cInformativeness\u201d).[49]\n Since Horn believes that interpretations like [10a] are derivable\nfrom the R-principle, he calls them \u201cR-based\nimplicatures\u201d. The assumption is that there is no reason to make\na stronger statement (say more) if the extra information can be\ncontributed by implicature. Implicature [11b] is similarly described\nas \u201cQ-based\u201d. The assumption is that if the speaker did\nnot make a stronger statement (say more), its denial was\nimplicated.\n\n(10) \nHe broke a finger.\n\n a. He broke a finger of his own. (\u201cR-based implicature\u201d)\n b.  \u2717He did not break a finger of his own.\n\n\n\n\n(11) \nHe entered a house.\n\n a.\u2717 He entered his own house. \n b.  He did not enter his own house.  (\u201cQ-based implicature\u201d)\n\n\n\n\nHorn has clearly identified two distinct and very general patterns of\nmeaning and interpretation. Critics maintain, however, that\nHorn\u2019s two principles provide no reason to expect the two\nindicated interpretations rather than those we do not observe (Lepore\n& Stone 2015: \u00a73.1; W. Davis 2016: \u00a74.7). They ask how Q\ncan predict [11b] without predicting [10b], and how [10a] can be\nderivable from R if [11a] is not. What in R predicts [10a] rather than\nother strengthenings, such as \u201cHe broke someone else\u2019s\nfinger\u201d?\n [50]\n\nHorn goes on to formulate what he calls the Division of\nPragmatic Labor:\n\n\nGiven two expressions covering the same semantic ground, a relatively\nunmarked form\u2014briefer and/or more lexicalized\u2014tends to be\nR-associated with a particular unmarked, stereotypical meaning, use,\nor situation, while the use of the periphrastic or less lexicalized\nexpression, typically more complex or prolix, tends to be Q-restricted\nto those situations outside the stereotype, for which the unmarked\nexpression could not have been used appropriately. (Horn 2004: 16)\n\n\nHorn illustrates this division with the contrast between (12) and\n(13).\n\n(12) \nShe stopped the machine.\n\n a. She stopped the\nmachine in the usual way. (\u201cR-based implicature\u201d)\n b.  \u2717She did\nnot stop the machine in the usual way.\n\n\n\n\n(13) \nShe got the machine to stop\n\n a.\u2717 She stopped the machine in the usual way. \n b.  She did not stop the machine in the usual way.  (\u201cQ-based implicature\u201d)\n\n\n\n\nHorn appears to be assuming, plausibly, that \u201cstopped\u201d and\n\u201cgot to stop\u201d have the same meaning. If so, then it is\ndifficult to see how either implicature could be derived from Q or R,\nwhich refer to what is said, not how it is said.\n(Recall Grice\u2019s nondetachability criterion.) Levinson (2000:\n136\u20137) therefore reinstated a version of\n Manner.[51]\n\n\nM Principle: Indicate abnormal, nonstereotypical\nsituations by using marked expressions that contrast with those you\nwould use to describe the corresponding normal, stereotypical\nsituations.\n\n\nLevinson describes \u201cgot to stop\u201d as \u201cmarked\u201d\nbecause it is more complex and less lexicalized than\n\u201cstopped\u201d. W. Davis (2016: 160) notes, though, that when\nwe look at clear cases in which a single word is synonymous with a\nless lexicalized phrase, we often find no difference in implicature\n(e.g., mare versus adult female horse). And the word\noften connotes an unusually good example of the kind (e.g.,\nstallion in common parlance connotes an especially fast or\ndominant uncastrated adult male horse).\n\nHorn sometimes describes Q and R as \u201cantinomic forces\u201d\n(e.g., Horn 2004: 14), which would be appropriate if the bracketed\nconditions were omitted. Without the conditions, Horn\u2019s\nprinciples would clash as often as\n Grice\u2019s.[52]\n Without independent means of determining antecedently which force\nwill \u201cprevail\u201d in a given case, Horn\u2019s principles\nwould lack predictive or explanatory value. Lepore & Stone (2015:\n\u00a73.1) suggest treating Horn\u2019s principles as\n\u201csimultaneous equations\u201d, constraining but not determining\nthe conversational implicatures. But this assumes the equations have a\nsolution. Not all simultaneous equations do.\n\nLevinson (2000: 157\u201364) sought to avoid clashes by stating an\norder of precedence: Q > M > R. Huang (2014: 49) reverses the\nordering, saying that\n\n\nthe R-principle generally takes precedence until the use of a\ncontrastive linguistic form induces a Q-implicature to the\nnon-applicability of the pertinent R-implicature\u2026.\n\n\nSuch orderings make sense only if the bracketed clauses in Q and R are\nomitted. W. Davis (2016: 159) responds that Levinson\u2019s ordering\nmakes it is hard to see why\n (10)\n or\n (12)\n should have an R implicature rather than a Q implicature, while\nHuang\u2019s ordering makes it hard to explain why\n (11)\n and\n (13)\n have Q\n implicatures.[53]\n",
