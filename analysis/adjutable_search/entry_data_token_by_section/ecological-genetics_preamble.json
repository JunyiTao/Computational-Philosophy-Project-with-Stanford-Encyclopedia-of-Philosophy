    "main_text": "\n\nEcological genetics is the broad field of studies that\ninvestigates the relationship between genetic change and features of\nthe biotic and abiotic environment. In population genetic theory, the\nrole of the environment in adaptive evolution tends to be hidden in\nthe recursion equations for gene frequency dynamics, where the common\nassumption of a constant selection coefficient implies a constant\nrelationship between genotype, phenotype and fitness irrespective of\nenvironment. For ecological genetics, in contrast, the\ncentral focus is the causal relationship between genetic variation and\nenvironmental variation, where conspicuous (especially discrete)\nphenotypic variation is assumed to have an underlying genetic\ncomponent. The advent of molecular tools and the development of\nmolecular ecology within ecological genetics has greatly broadened the\nconceptual scope of the field within the last fifteen years.\n\nThe origins of ecological genetics are founded in the\n\u201cmodern synthesis\u201d (Huxley 1942), where the integration of\ngenetics and Darwinian evolution was achieved through the theoretical\nworks of R. A. Fisher, S. Wright, and J. B. S. Haldane and the\nconceptual works and influential writings of J. Huxley, T. Dobzhansky,\nand H. J. Muller. From these genetic beginnings, it was natural for\nmuch evolutionary research to be concentrated on the forces that cause\nchanges in gene and genotype frequencies within populations. In this\ngenetics-centered view, the four evolutionary forces (mutation, random\ngenetic drift, natural selection, and gene flow) act within and among\npopulations to cause micro-evolutionary change. Those same forces act\nin concert to convert the genetic variation within populations into\nmore or less permanent genetic variation between species. Given enough\ntime, the micro-evolutionary forces are believed to be sufficient to\naccount for macro-evolutionary patterns characteristic of the higher\ntaxonomic groups. In short, the central challenge of the field of\nevolutionary genetics has been to describe how the four\nevolutionary forces shape patterns of gene, genome and species\ndiversity, with a particular emphasis on the predominant role of\nnatural selection among the several evolutionary forces.\n\nHowever, the gene-centered viewpoint was not the primary research\nfocus or challenge for a large subset of field researchers, consisting\nof naturalists, zoologists and ecologists. Their focus was similarly\non natural selection as the only evolutionary force which can produce\nadaptation, the fit between an organism and its environment. However,\nits focus is on the role of environment in adaptation. Ecological\ngenetics is the study of evolutionary processes, especially\nadaptation by natural selection, in an ecological context in order to\naccount for phenotypic patterns observed in nature. Where evolutionary\ngenetics tends toward a branch of applied mathematics founded on\nMendelian axioms, ecological genetics is grounded in the\nreciprocal interaction between theory and empirical observations from\nfield and laboratory.\n",
