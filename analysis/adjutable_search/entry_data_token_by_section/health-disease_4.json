    "main_text": "Naturalism || Specifying Causes\n4.2 Specifying Causes\n\nWe have arrived at a generic naturalism that says judgments of illness\nare sensitive to causal antecedents of the right sort, as well as to\nvalue judgments about the effects of those causes. What are the right\ncausal antecedents? Culver and Gert\u2019s (1982) requirement that the\nantecedents be a \u201cnondistinct sustaining cause\u201d is a\nbiologically noncommittal criterion. Culver and Gert analyze the\nconcept of a malady, which involves suffering evils, or increased risk\nof evil, due to \u201ca condition not sustained by something\ndistinct\u201d from oneself (1982, 72). The cause can be physical or\nmental, (p.87), provided it is a sustaining cause that is not distinct\nfrom the sufferer (p.88). A wrestler\u2019s hammerlock, because its effects\ncome and go with the presence or absence of the cause itself, is an\nexample of a sustaining cause. But because the wrestler is a distinct\nentity from the sufferer, someone in a hammerlock does not have a\nmalady. If the cause is inside the body it is nondistinct just in case\nit is difficult to remove (e.g. a surgical implement left behind in\nthe body) or it is biologically integrated in the body (e.g. a\nretrovirus). This is an attractively simple solution but it is too\ninclusive. Culver and Gert (p.71) say that loss of freedom,\nopportunity or pleasure count as evils. But if that is so, then black\ncitizens of South Africa and Mississippi (among many other places)\nused to suffer from maladies, since they were unfree, unhappy and\noppressed. And they suffered these evils because of black skin, which\nwas a nondistinct sustaining aspect of their nature. But it wasn\u2019t a\ndisease. Of course, the presence of racism, backed up by coercive\nsocial structures, was also necessary, but aspects of the environment\nare implicated in many maladies. \n\nThis counterexample is instructive, however, since there are two ways\nof amending the proposal in the light of it. First, perhaps the\nprinciple of nondistinct sustaining causes fails to capture our\nintuitions about causes of disease. A second possibility is that the\nprinciple is a good causal condition, but that the account of evils is\ntoo broad, and needs to be restricted to a more intuitively medical\nset of evils, rather than the broader class of impediments to\nwell-being. The section on health will go over the terrain that\u2019s\nrelevant for the second option; the current discussion is about the\ncausal condition. Boorse (1975, 1976, 1977, 1997) and his followers\nhave opted for a more restrictive view of the causes of disease. They\ncontend that disease necessarily involves biological malfunction.\nBoorse distinguished \u201cdisease\u201d from \u201cillness\u201d.\nThe former is the failure to conform to the \u201cspecies-typical\ndesign\u201d of humans, and the latter is a matter of judgments that\na disease is undesirable, entitles one to special treatment, or\nexcuses bad behavior. An account of malfunction must be parasitic on a\ntheory of function. Boorse thinks a function is a\n\u2018species-typical\u2019 contribution to survival and\nreproduction (1976, 62\u201363). Disease is failure to function\naccording to a species design, in which functional efficiency is\neither degraded below the typical level or limited by environmental\nagents (1977, 550, 555, 567; 1997, 32). Boorse understands this as\nfunctioning \u201cmore than a certain distance below the population\nmean\u201d (1977, 559) for the relevant set of humans. (Since not all\nmembers of a species have the same design in every respect, we need to\nspecify reference classes according to biologically relevant\nsubgroups.) This cutoff point, he thinks, can only be specified as a\nmatter of convention, but this conventional element does not threaten\nthe objectivity of diagnoses. Responses to Boorse since the original\ntheory was formulated have concentrated on two issues. First is the\napparent existence of states like tooth decay that are widespread, so\napparently statistically normal, yet definitely pathologies. The\nsecond is the\u201cline-drawing problem\u201d Schwartz (2007) which\ncomes in two related guises: how we are to reference classes and how\nwe can distinguish between normal and abnormal levels of functional\nefficiency.\n\nBoorse\u2019s position has been very influential and shaped the entire\nrecent literature. Williams (2007) retains the spirit of the proposal\nbut departs from it in arguing that disease is realized not in\nsystemic malfunctions but failures of interacting cellular networks;\nhe regards applications of disease language to organs, for example, as\nnot strictly speaking correct. Most theorists, though, have continued\nto emphasis malfunction in physiological mechanisms more broadly. In\npsychiatry, for instance, Wakefield (1992, 1997a, 1997b), follows\nBoorse (1976) in assuming that humans have a species-typical design,\nwhich he assumes is a product of natural selection. Wakefield applies\nthe picture to both mental and physical illness: in Wakefield\u2019s\nversion we first judge that a psychological mechanism is not\nperforming the function for which natural selection designed it;\nsecond, we judge that the malfunction is harmful. An appeal to natural\nfunction, by adding extra commitments to the idea of a cause of\nillness, rules out skin pigment as a cause of evil.\n\nCooper (2002, p.265) suggests that a straightforward appeal to\ndysfunction must be qualified in light of some apparent\ncounterexamples. A woman taking contraceptive pills, for example, may\nbe interfering with typical functioning, but ingesting contraceptives\nis not a disease. (Boorse would have to call it a self-inflicted\ndisease that does not make the woman ill.) Cooper also raises the\nproblem of individuals with chronic conditions that are controlled by\ndrugs. She argues that these are cases of diseased subjects who\nnonetheless function normally and suggests that the analysis must be\namended to talk of a disposition to malfunction. But, as Cooper sees,\nthe big problem faced by Boorsian accounts is that of coming up with\nan acceptable conception of normal function in the first place. \n\nThere are two problems that we can distinguish here. The first is\nwhether a non-normative account of malfunction is possible, about\nwhich much debate has taken place. A second problem has come into\nfocus more recently. If there is a positive scientific account of\nfunction and malfunction that is pertinent to disease, which science\nowns it? The debate deriving from Boorse\u2019s work has assumed that\nphysiologists and pathologists have the last word here. Following\nBoorse, Hausman (2015, p. 9) is explicit that physiologists and\npathologists are the relevant medical specialists whose judgments we\ncare about. Lemoine and Giroux (2016) question the great stress on\nphysiology to the exclusion of other medical specialties in Boorse\n\u2013 they think he has backed the wrong doctors. Lemoine and Giroux\nthink we should see physiology as the science of how organisms work\nconsidered as assemblies of organ systems. But they think that the\nscience of health and disease is defined by broader medical\nconsiderations that go beyond the physiological. Tied up with this is\na broad consensus that the correct explanation of disease states is\nmechanistic, though this too has been challenged in the name of more\nabstract explanations from different parts of medicine (Darrason\n2018). \n",
