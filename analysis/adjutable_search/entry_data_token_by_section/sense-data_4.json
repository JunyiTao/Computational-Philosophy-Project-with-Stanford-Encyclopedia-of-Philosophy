Major Critical Responses or Oppositions\n\nThe topic of sense data was heavily discussed in the middle decades of\nthe twentieth century, and some notable criticisms were\n published.[19]\n\nAustin\u2019s lectures in Oxford (from 1947 on), critical of sense\ndata, were published in 1962 as Sense and Sensibilia. They\ntook aim at the doctrine that\n\n\nwe never see or otherwise perceive (or \u2018sense\u2019), or anyhow\nwe never directly perceive or sense, material objects (or material\nthings), but only sense-data. (1962: 2)\n\n\nAustin accuses Ayer (1940), Price (1932), and others of embracing a\n\u201cscholastic\u201d view that analyzes a few poorly understood\nwords and \u201chalf-studied \u2018facts\u2019\u201d. By contrast,\nhe promises to show\n\n\nthat our ordinary words are much subtler in their uses, and mark many\nmore distinctions, than philosophers have realized; and that the facts\nof perception, as discovered by, for instance, psychologists but also\nas noted by common mortals, are much more diverse and complicated than\nhas been allowed for. (1962: 3)\n\n\nAustin\u2019s criticisms focus on language use, even while dissenting\nfrom Ayer that the issues are entirely terminological (Austin 1962:\nch. 6). He focuses on the \u201cargument from illusion\u201d from\nAyer (also citing Price), and complains that ordinary cases of\nperceptual relativity and variation, such as the elliptical-looking\npenny, are not normally taken to be illusions. In fact, as we have\nseen, many earlier sense-data theorists would agree. Austin has little\nto say about the Argument from Perceptual Variation from the classical\ndiscussions. He finds the penny example to be atypical because pennies\nhave stable, sharply bounded shapes whereas many objects, such as\ncats, do not. In considering the Argument from Illusion, Austin (1962:\n52) objects to the continuity premise, which we have just seen in\nPrice: that if, in one case, we explain a mismatch between object and\nperception by introducing a special entity such as a sense datum, we\nmust then accept that in phenomenally similar cases we can\u2019t\nhave direct, veridical perception. (The continuity premise remains in\ndispute today, see Crane & French 2015 [2021].) More generally,\nsense-data theorists had argued that in describing elliptical\nappearances gained from a penny, one adopts a special sense of\n\u201csee\u201d that (1) does not require that an elliptical\nmaterial object exists, but (2) does affirm that an elliptical sense\ndatum exists (1962: ch. 3). Austin\u2019s denial that something\nelliptical must be seen in such cases draws on ordinary language. But\nPrice and others distinguished different senses of perception words\nadvisedly; Austin fails to engage their reasons more directly.\nFurther, he does not consider theorists who say that we perceive\nmaterial things as a result of sensing sense data (e.g., Broad 1923:\n248).\n\nAnother challenge to sense-data theory sought to reveal a\n\u201csense-datum fallacy\u201d (Chisholm 1957: 151\u2013152). The\ncharge is that sense-data theorists make inferences like this:\nsomething appears elliptical, therefore what we see is an appearance\nthat is\n elliptical.[20]\n The fallacy consists in simply assuming that if something appears a\ncertain way (such as Price\u2019s flat circle produced by a spherical\nball), something must exist that is that way (a sense datum). Critics\nthen argue that, in asserting that something appears elliptical (or\nflat), one might simply be describing the character of the appearance,\nnot asserting that an item with an elliptical shape (or flat surface)\nis present. Afterall, we normally do accept that things need not be as\nthey appear. In response, it has been contended that sense-data\ntheorists do not simply move from \u201cappears elliptical\u201d to\n\u201cis elliptical\u201d (Smith 2002: 35\u201336). Rather, the\npositing of sense data most commonly arises through acceptance of an\nact-object analysis of perception\n (item 8),\n which also affirms that the objects of perception are directly\napprehended\n (item 1)\n and that they are as they appear\n (item 3).\n The arguments from Variation and Illusion may then be used to contend\nthat we often experience perceptual objects whose properties are\ndistinct from the properties ascribed to material objects, as in the\npenny appearing elliptical, and that from the qualitative similarity\nof illusions (or variant appearances) and alleged direct perceptions,\nwe should conclude that we are always acquainted with sense data. Such\narguments may indeed be challenged, but there has been no simple and\nunwary move from appears such to is such.\n\nTheorists who sought to avoid this alleged fallacy held that a penny\nmight appear elliptical in a phenomenally direct way without an\nelliptical item being present to the mind. These are sometimes known\nas \u201cappearance theories\u201d. One such position is the\nadverbial analysis, which holds that phenomenal qualities inhere in\nthe mental activity of perceiving but without being present as objects\nor as property-instances. Accordingly, we perceive the penny itself,\nbut perceive it in a certain manner: roundly, or elliptically, and\nredly (Ducasse 1942; Chisholm 1957: part 3). To say that we are\nexperiencing the penny elliptically is to say that we enjoy an\nelliptical appearance without there being an actually elliptical item\npresent to us; rather, the appearance is understood simply as our\nmanner of sensing the penny, or as the way our sensory activity makes\nus experience the shape of the penny. A related sort of appearance\ntheory renders the elliptical appearance as a mental content, or an\nintentional state, with the contents elliptical and red (Barnes\n1944\u20131945). Accordingly, via intentional content, one can\nexperience an elliptical spatial structure without being acquainted\nwith an actually elliptical object. The intentional content\ninstantiates an appearance as a state of the perceiver, whose\nperceptual experience thereby represents the world as being a certain\nway, for instance, as containing an elliptical shape. (Intentionalist\ntheories are found in Dretske 1995 and Tye 1995; an important earlier\nformulation is Anscombe 1965.) These two types of theories account for\nVariation and Illusion via adverbial or intentional contents that can\nalso account for veridical cases of perception. Indeed, these theories\ncan allow that, in some instances (with moderate slant), we see a\npenny that is round by seeing it as being round and slanted relative\nto the line of sight. Adverbialists would say that we see the penny\nroundly; intentionalists, that we see the penny via mental content\nthat represents it as being round. (On these philosophies of\nperception, see Crane & French 2015 [2021].)\n\nThere is a tradition in philosophy and psychology that denies, on\nphenomenal grounds, the distinction between impoverished, typically\ntwo-dimensional sensory contents or states and the perception of\nobjects in three dimensions. One can see William James\u2019s\naffirmation that sensations are intrinsically world-directed (1890, 2:\n1\u20133) and exhibit three-dimensional volume (1890, 2:\n135\u2013136) as objecting in advance to the Classical Notion of\nsense data. James denies\n item 5,\n that sense data are neutral about a world beyond them, in favor of a\nposition that both sensation and perception give us \u201can\nimmediately present outward reality\u201d (1890, 2: 2). The Gestalt\npsychologists (Koffka 1935: chs. 1\u20133; K\u00f6hler 1929 [1947:\nchs. 1\u20133]) also adopted a position in which we are perceptually\ngiven a world, not an impoverished content or object distinct from the\nworld. They made perception of the valence or functional values of the\nworld into an immediately given aspect of perceptual content. They\nalso denied that two-dimensional sensations or sense data are the core\nfrom which perceptions are developed: the world is given in\n three-dimensions.[21]\n The Gestalt theorists drew attention to the phenomena of size and\nshape constancy. If two objects of the same size are presented at five\nand ten feet, the retinal image of the farther object will be half as\nlarge (in linear height) as the image of the nearby object; yet\nobservers report them to be phenomenally of the same size (or nearly\nso). Similarly, a circle seen at a (moderate) slant projects an\nellipse on the retina but appears circular. These theorists contended\nthat significant phenomenal differences in size between the two\nobjects, and the appearance of an elliptical shape, are produced only\nunder special laboratory conditions or through trained acts of\nattention, as might be found in those who are taught to draw (Koffka\n1935: 222\u2013223; K\u00f6hler 1929 [1947: 71\u201374]).\nSubsequently, the perceptual psychologist James J. Gibson (1950)\nagreed with the Gestalt theorists in arguing that the two-dimensional\nexperiences that are like sense data arise from acts of attention that\nartificially alter our phenomenology away from the three-dimensional\nvisual world that we normally perceive. Accordingly, the\ntwo-dimensional visual field is not an immediate object of perception\nor primitive constituent of perception that is uncovered by attention.\nRather, it is constructed through a special effort of attention.\nGibson held that, in everyday perception of a circle at a slant (say,\nyour neighbor\u2019s plate at a dinner party), the object looks like\na circle at a slant and so looks circular, not elliptical (1950: chs.\n1, 9). In subsequent writings, Gibson (1966, 1979) developed the\nnotion that sensory systems are attuned for presenting to perceivers a\nnavigable environment and its affordances for meeting the\nperceiver\u2019s needs and goals.\n\nEach of these three theoretical stances denies, on phenomenal grounds,\nthe two-fold character of perceptual consciousness, or the division\ninto impoverished sensuous element and accompanying interpretation or\nobject-positing. Rather, sensory experience is intrinsically\nworld-presenting, spatially expansive (in three dimensions), and\nutility alerting.\n\nWilfrid Sellars sought to unmask the \u201cmyth\u201d of a pure\ngiven to which subjects can respond atomistically in a way that yields\nan epistemic given (a primitive basis for knowledge). According to\nSellars\u2019s highly regarded \u201cEmpiricism and the Philosophy\nof Mind\u201d (1956), the \u201cclassical\u201d sense datum\nposition holds that \u201cs is red\u201d can be known\nnon-inferentially. Classical sense-data philosophers\n\n\nhave taken givenness to be a fact which presupposes no learning, no\nforming of associations, no setting up of stimulus-response\nconnections. (1956: \u00a76)\n\n\nThey accept an \u201cinconsistent triad\u201d:\n\n\nX senses red sense-content s entails x\nnon-inferentially knows that s is red.\nThe ability to sense sense-contents is unacquired.\nThe ability to know facts of the form x is \u03c6 is\nacquired.\n\n\nA and B together entail not-C; B and C entail not-A; A and C entail\nnot-B. (1956: \u00a76, emended)\n\n\nWho allegedly subscribed to this triad? Some of Sellars\u2019s\nexamples draw from early modern philosophy; he effectively attributes\na version of A and B to Locke, Berkeley, and Hume (1956: \u00a728)\nbut, it seems, not C. He criticizes Ayer\u2019s linguistic analysis\n(1956: \u00a7\u00a78\u20139) but suggests that it is aimed more at\nanalyzing object-talk into sense-data talk than at showing sense-data\ntalk to be epistemically basic (as in A). He briefly alludes to Broad\n(1956: \u00a711) and Price (1956: \u00a731), without ascribing the\ntriad to them. He also devotes considerable attention further on to\nthe role of an ostensive \u201cgiven\u201d within the\n\u201cpositivistic conception of science\u201d (1956: \u00a743), and\nit is tempting to surmise that his main target was that conception as\nput forward by Carnap, Reichenbach, and others. To assess that\ndirection, we would need to interpret the positivist shift from\nelementary experiences to protocol sentences as epistemically basic,\nwhich would take us far afield (but see Leitgeb & Carus 2020).\n\nIn relation to the triad, a prominent reading of Locke has him impute\nepistemic authority to sensory ideas as giving knowledge of their\ncauses (Ayers 1991: vol. 1, ch. 18). Locke is attributed A and B but\nnot C. It is doubtful that Descartes, who distinguished sensing from\njudging, would endorse A. Among the classical sense-data theorists,\nmany would deny A, distinguishing sensing and\n\u201cacquaintance\u201d from \u201cknowing that\u201d; sensing\nred may usually and non-inferentially lead to knowing that s is red,\nbut not as a simple matter of entailment. Russell explicitly denied A;\nsensing may be unacquired but \u201cknowing that\u201d involves\njudging, not mere sensing, and the universals that enter judgments of\nsensory quality (such as whiteness) are acquired, affirming C. Sellars\nhimself rejects A, complicates B, and affirms C, adopting (by\nassumption) a position of \u201cpsychological nominalism\u201d\n(1956: \u00a729), according to which kind-terms, including color\nterms, and the ability to be aware of color instances are learned as\npart of a linguistic and conceptual web of meaning (holism).\n\nIn his holism about color terms, Sellars raised an objection that\nwould engage Russell\u2019s conception of atomic statements about\nsense data as epistemically basic (Russell\u2019s psychologically and\nlogically primitive hard data). Sellars (1956) constructs an elaborate\nmyth of his own, in which our behaviorist ancestors must learn to\ntreat thoughts as internal states of one another and subsequently to\nself-report their own thoughts (1956: \u00a7\u00a747\u201359). He\nextends the story from the attribution of inner thoughts to one\nanother to the positing of internal sensory impressions (1956:\n\u00a7\u00a760\u201362). His view differs from Russell\u2019s\nposition in making the ability to be aware of red sense experiences\ndepend on the acquisition of a sophisticated web of meaning and\ntheory; this ability is not \u201cgiven\u201d. Nor, as Russell would\nhave it, is the universal red needed for knowing that s is\nred, \u201ceasily acquired\u201d (1912 [1997: 101]). Accordingly,\nthere are no easily acquired color predicates to describe the sense\ndata that ground knowledge. Sellars asserts that\n\n\ninstead of coming to have a concept of something because we have\nnoticed that sort of thing, to have the ability to notice a sort of\nthing is already to have the concept of that sort of thing, and cannot\naccount for it. (1956: \u00a745)\n\n\nSellars claims the advantage that, through this social process of\nacquisition, sense impressions lose \u201cabsolute privacy\u201d and\nbecome objects of intersubjective knowledge (1956: \u00a762), and here\nhe directly departs from\n item 7\n in the Classical Notion. But he has also rejected the acquaintance\nview of sense data as immediately present to the mind prior to\nlearning\n (item 2).\n Sellars\u2019s holistic conception that the acquisition of\nphenomenal concepts enables the ability to observe and self-report the\npresence of sense particulars may offer better reasons for rejecting\nitem 2 of the Classical Notion than are found in his discussion of the\ninconsistent triad.\n",
