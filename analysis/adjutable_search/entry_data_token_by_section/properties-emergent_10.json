    "main_text": "Strong Emergence || Strong emergence: from property to substance dualism?\n4.3 Strong emergence: from property to substance dualism?\n\nEmergentists of all varieties standardly are physical substance\nmonists about the natural world: all worldly (natural or artifactual)\nentities are composed or otherwise \u201cmade of\u201d entities that\nwould be described in a completed fundamental physics, whether\nphysical particles, fields, strings, or something else. This view is\ncommon enough among emergentists that some influential theorists took\nit to be a defining element of the doctrine. One might maintain,\nconsistent with substance monism, that wholes exhibiting strongly\nemergent, efficacious properties are fundamental, albeit composite\nobjects or systems, on the grounds that quantification over\nthem is required for a minimally adequate account of the world\u2019s\ndynamics. This might also give rise to an objective basis for identity\nthrough time, even for organisms undergoing constant change of parts\n(see O\u2019Connor & Jacobs 2003).\n\nBut one can argue that strong emergentism, at least with respect to\nsome or all mental states, in fact requires a form of substance\ndualism. On a biological view of emergent thinkers, the micro-physical\nboundaries of such thinkers may inevitably be vague, for empirical\nreasons. But it is perhaps doubtful that fundamental causal\nlaws associated with strongly emergent properties would reference\nvague conditions. The sole apparent alternative is that the properties\nare instantiated in a distinct, non-vague object instead, as a\nnon-physical mind would be. (See Zimmerman 2010 and Hasker 2016 and,\nfor a reply, O\u2019Connor 2016.)\n\nOne might also argue for an emergentist form of substance dualism as\nnecessary to account for (what many strong emergentists regarding\nconsciousness accept) there being unified subjects of conscious\nexperience (Nida-R\u00fcmelin 2007) or it being an objective matter\nwhether a conscious subject does or does not survive certain kinds of\nradical change (Swinburne 2013). Finally, many general accounts of the\ncategories of substance/object or physical substance/object in\nparticular entail that if an object has non-physical properties, it\nwill fail to count as a composed or physical substance (Francescotti\n2001, Schneider 2012, and O\u2019Connor 2018.)\n\nSupposing that strong emergence does bring a new substance in its\nwake, the spirit if not the letter of the usual emergentist commitment\nto substance monism is maintained by the weaker constraint that no\n\u201chigher-level\u201d substances or subjects \u201cfloat\nfree\u201d, actually or modally, from their dependence bases. It is\nfor just this reason that both Lowe (2008) and Nida-R\u00fcmelin\n(2007) characterize their substance dualism as\n\u201cnon-Cartesian\u201d.\n",
