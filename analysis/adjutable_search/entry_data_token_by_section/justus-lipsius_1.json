    "main_text": "De constantia\n2. De constantia\n\nThe young Lipsius began his philological study of Seneca, like that of\nTacitus, during his stay in Rome in 1569. It was Marc-Antoine Muret\nwho first stimulated his interest in Seneca and Roman Stoicism, giving\nrise to a life-long obsession which would alternate between philology\nand philosophy. Lipsius\u2019s philosophical interest in Roman\nStoicism led to the publication of his highly successful Senecan\ndialogue, set in the midst of the violent religious and political\nstruggles of the Netherlands, De constantia in publicis malis\n(\u201cOn Constancy in Times of Public Calamity\u201d, 1583/4). This\nwas his earliest attempt to combine Stoicism and Christianity in order\nto create a new philosophy which would help individuals to live\nthrough the difficult period of civil and religious wars which were\ntearing Northern Europe apart.\n\nA closer look at Lipsius\u2019s first Neostoic work reveals that\nDe constantia was the manifesto of a humanist who was\nconvinced that he had found in Seneca\u2019s philosophy both a\nconsolation and a solution to the public calamities which he and his\ncontemporaries were enduring. From Seneca\u2019s De vita\nbeata (15.8), Lipsius takes the leitmotif: \u201cwe are\nborn into a kingdom where obedience to God is true liberty\u201d\n(De constantia I.14). After defining God, providence and\nfate, he comes to necessity (necessitas), the logical\nconclusion of their co-operation: everything which is governed by fate\nhappens by necessity (De constantia I.19). The most obvious\nexample of this natural necessity is the decay and destruction of all\ntemporal things (De constantia I.15\u201316).\n\nWhile consoling his readers, Lipsius does not deny the hubris of\npower, the atrocities of history or the cruelty of tyrants and\nemperors. Yet he tries to encourage his readers to adopt an attitude\nof constancy by listing a long series of divinae clades\n(divinely sanctioned disasters): horrifying examples from history\nmeant to illustrate the utility of divine punishment and to\ndemonstrate that evils such as earthquakes, pestilence, war and\ntyranny are part and parcel of the human condition \u2014 indeed, of\nGod\u2019s plan for the preservation and improvement of the whole\nworld. Moreover, he argues, the evils of the present time are neither\nparticularly grave nor worse than those which existed in the past:\n\u201cJust as work becomes easier if shared by more people, so too\ndoes sorrow\u201d (De constantia II.26).\n\nThe truly wise man is therefore expected to accept the law of\nnecessity (lex necessitatis) with steadfastness and mental\nfortitude While realizing \u201cthat man is but a dream of a\nshadow,\u201d he should show disdain for the course of human events\nby cultivating constantia: \u201cthe upright and immovable\nmental strength, which is neither lifted up nor depressed by external\nor accidental circumstances\u201d (De constantia I.4). The\nmother of this constancy is patience, which is governed by reason.\nReason (ratio) \u2014 as opposed to false opinions \u2014\nis nothing other than a true judgment concerning things both human and\ndivine. It is this internal transformation \u2014 based on the\nessential Stoic attributes of reason, freedom from the emotions,\npatience in adversity and subjection to God\u2019s will \u2014 which\nmakes it possible to live contentedly amid the inevitable decay and\nturmoil of the world.\n\nSo, \u201cenveloped by the mist and clouds of opinion\u201d (De\nconstantia I.2), we must never stop attempting to conquer our\npassions and emotions (adfectus) \u2014 desire, joy, fear\nand pain (cupiditas, gaudium, metus and\ndolor) \u2014 and our false opinions by means of reason. Not\nonly do emotions disturb the equilibrium of the soul and impede\nconstancy, they are false and dangerous, since they can upset the\ndetachment needed by the wise man(sapiens). Consequently, it\nis necessary \u201cto steel our mind and so temper it that we may\nachieve peace in the midst of turmoil and tranquility in the midst of\nconflict\u201d (De constantia I.1). If reason, the lawful\nruler of our mind, can conquer our passions and false opinions, we\nwill be able to face public and private evil with true constancy. Due\nto three emotions, however \u2014simulatio or deception,\npietas or patriotism, and miseratio or pity for\nmisfortunes of others \u2014 we all carry war around within\nourselves. Even worse, what appears to us to be a virtue is actually a\nvice, for thinking that we suffer on account of the sufferings of our\ncountry causes us to grieve for our self and our property, while pity\nfor the sufferings of others is unworthy of a wise man. We must\ntherefore obey the Stoic injunction to extirpate all these harmful\nemotions.\n\nThe dialogue between Lipsius and his old friend Langius \u2014 cast\nin the role of the Stoic sapiens who had achieved mastery\nover his emotions by reason \u2014 was clearly intended to provide\nreaders with something simpler than contemporary philosophy, which\nLipsius criticized for its excessive subtlety, and to establish\nconstancy as the chief virtue. Lipsius\u2019s De constantia\nthus has a different focus from the Senecan treatise De constantia\nsapientis (\u201cOn the Constancy of the Wise Man\u201d), on\nwhich it was ostensibly modeled; for in chapters 1\u201312 of Book I\nLipsius puts forward the virtue of constancy as a remedy for the\nturmoil of the times and urges readers to detach themselves completely\nfrom all feelings which might lead to any sort of emotional\ninvolvement in the political and religious wars which were raging\naround them.\n\nNevertheless, he did not counsel withdrawal from public affairs and\nretreat into private life. Stoics and Christians were cosmopolitans,\nwhose \u201ctrue native land was the heavens.\u201d They\n\u201cshould be good citizens in order to be good men\u201d (De\nconstantia 1.12) and, as such, yield to God\u2019s plan for\nmankind and to the immutable power of providence.\n\nThe result of Lipsius\u2019s repackaging of Stoic apatheia\n(emotionlessness) as an appropriate antidote to the religious and\npolitical passions of his day and of his transformation of Stoic fate\ninto Christian divine providence (by subordinating fate to God instead\nof vice versa) was that his brand of Neostoicism became as suitable\nfor Christians as the Aristotelianism of Thomas Aquinas and the\nPlatonism of Marsilio Ficino.\n\nAlthough De constantia was not Lipsius\u2019s most\nsystematic or theoretical treatment of Stoic ethics, but rather a book\nof practical psychology, a manual for wise living, it acquired a\nleading position in European thought. Going through more than eighty\neditions between the sixteenth and the eighteenth centuries, over\nforty in the original Latin and the rest in translations into a wide\nrange of modern European languages, the treatise, which embodied\nelements of militant Calvinism together with arguments on free will\nused by the Jesuits, became common cultural property during the\nBaroque period, influencing scholarship, poetry and art up to the\nEnlightenment.\n",
