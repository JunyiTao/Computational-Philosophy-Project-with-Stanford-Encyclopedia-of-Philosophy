Once it was thought that the first\nwas a scientific work and the latter a religious one. Since these\ncategories were understood to be antithetical, there could be no\nrelation at all between them; Empedocles had just written two\nincompatible poems. More recently, as the usefulness of such a rigid\ndichotomy seemed less plausible, commentators have seen the teaching\nabout nature as continuous with Purifications. Both, after\nall, give a prominent place to Love and Strife. Nature, then, is ruled\nby the very same principles that are the key to understanding the\ndrama of the ethical life, as Empedocles represents that.\nUnderstanding how nature works, one will want to side with Love and\nnot Strife\u2014especially, one will want to avoid the shedding of\nblood, that whereby we think and perceive, the very principle of\nconscious life. This sort of approach sees a complementarity between\nthe natural philosophy and the religious narrative. However, in light\nof the Strasbourg manuscript, some have argued for a tighter unity.\nMartin and Primavesi, for instance, focus on a part of\nensemble a which describes the moment when\nStrife dominates in the vortex and Love comes to be in its center.\nThis description mirrors the same event described in B 35 (= D 75),\nexcept that, besides roots being united by Love, there are also\npersons of some sort being united in Love. According to the authors,\nthese persons are the incarnated daimones of\nPurifications; in turn, these daimones, whose\npunishment through incarnation is coming to an end, are also particles\nof Love. The dissolution of composite beings under Strife, then,\nliberates these particles of Love from their cycle of incarnation and\nthey unite in Love at its advent in the center of the whirl (Martin\n& Primavesi 1999: 83\u201386, 90\u201395). Such interpretations\nmight imply that there are not two poems but one. Nevertheless, the\nway textual support has been marshaled for these sorts of readings has\nnot gone uncriticized (see Laks 2002, Bollack 2005). A third\ninterpretation has recently been proposed, which views the differences\nin emphasis between the works as not necessarily establishing two\nseparate texts, but two \u2018levels\u2019 of teaching: esoteric and\nexoteric (Curd 2005). On this reading, Empedocles is in fact\naddressing two audiences, one general, represented by the people of\nAcragas and the second-person plural, and one specialized group of\nintimates, represented by the appeals to Pausanias and the use of the\nsecond-person singular. The general audience is instructed in public\nlectures on the necessity of purifying themselves and the means to do\nso. By contrast, the inner circle receives a detailed explanation of\nthe cosmos\u2019 inner workings, a more rigorous account of\nEmpedocles\u2019 daemonology, and unique powers.\n",
