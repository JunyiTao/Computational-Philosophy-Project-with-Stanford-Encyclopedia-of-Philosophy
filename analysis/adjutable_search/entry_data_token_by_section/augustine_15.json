    "main_text": "Creation and Time\n11. Legacy\n\nAugustine\u2019s impact on later philosophy is as enormous as it is\nambivalent (for an overview, see Fuhrer 2018a: 1742\u20131750; for\nall questions of detail, Pollmann (ed.) 2013; for De\ntrinitate, Kany 2007). Although he was soon accepted as a\ntheological authority and consensus with him was regarded as a\nstandard of orthodoxy throughout the Middle Ages and beyond, his\nviews\u2014or more precisely, the right way of interpreting\nthem\u2014continued to trigger controversies. In the ninth century\nthe monk Gottschalk took Augustine\u2019s doctrine of grace to imply\ndouble predestination (a term coined by him); he was opposed by John\nScotus Eriugena. The philosophical discourse of early scholasticism\n(11th\u201312th centuries) largely centered on\nAugustinian themes. Anselm\u2019s proof of the existence of God\ndevelops the argument of De libero arbitrio, bk. 2; the\nethicists\u2019 debates on will and conscience rest on the\nassumptions of Augustine\u2019s moral intentionalism, and\nAbelard\u2019s view that ethics is universal and applicable to both\nhuman and divine agency may be read as a response to the problems in\nAugustine\u2019s theory of divine election. With the growing\ninfluence of Aristotle from the thirteenth century onwards, Augustine\ncame to be interpreted in Aristotelian terms that had largely been\nunknown to himself. Thomas Aquinas and others had little interest in\nAugustine\u2019s Platonism, and there was a certain tension between\nthe medieval tendency to look for a teachable philosophical and\ntheological system in his texts and his own way of philosophical\ninquiry that was shaped by the ancient tradition and left room for\ntentative argument and was open to revision. Medieval political\nAugustinianism projected the conflict of the Two Cities onto the\nChurch and the State. Martin Luther (1483\u20131546) agrees with\nAugustine on the absolute gratuitousness of grace but does not follow\nthe Augustinian (and scholastic) ideal of intellectus fidei\nand makes faith in the Gospel the decisive condition of salvation. In\nhis debate with Erasmus on free will, he voices a quite Augustinian\npessimism about human freedom. The variety of Protestantism that was\ninaugurated by Jean Calvin (1509\u20131564) accepts double\npredestination. In the seventeenth century Descartes\u2019 cogito was\nsoon recognized as an Augustinian idea and triggered a refreshed\ninterest in Augustine\u2019s epistemology. In the same epoch, the\nJansenist movement put forward a radical interpretation of\nAugustine\u2019s theology of grace and justification that was\nfiercely combated by the Catholic Church. In the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries, the leading philosophers of Enlightenment,\nGerman Idealism and Romanticism showed little interest in Augustine,\nand even, in the case of Nietzsche, outright contempt. He remained,\nhowever, an important figure in Neoscholasticism or Neothomism, a\nphilosophical reaction of Catholic philosophers against Enlightenment\nand Idealism which continued to inform Catholic theological\nscholarship on Augustine till the 1950s and beyond. In the twentieth\ncentury, Augustine\u2019s philosophy of time (Confessiones\n11) received enormous and unprecedented philosophical attention from\nthinkers like Edmund Husserl (1859\u20131938), Martin Heidegger\n(1889\u20131976) and Paul Ric\u0153ur (1913\u20132005), some of\nwhom credited Augustine with their own subjectivist understanding of\ntime. Hannah Arendt (1906\u20131975) wrote her doctoral dissertation\non Augustine\u2019s philosophy of love and blamed him, not uncommonly\nfor her epoch, for degrading love of neighbor to an instrument of\npersonal happiness. Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889\u20131951) takes issue\nwith what he considers Augustine\u2019s view of language and language\nacquisition throughout his analysis of language in the\nPhilosophical Investigations. Postmodernist thinkers\n(Jean-Luc Marion, John Milbank) have set Augustine\u2019s notion of\nself, in which love is perceived as an integral part, against the\npurported egoism and isolation of the Cartesian subject, which is\nconsidered the hallmark and, as it were, the birth defect of\nmodernity. Like their medieval predecessors, modern and postmodern\nappropriations of Augustine are selective and inevitably conditioned\nby contemporary concerns, sometimes resulting in secularized readings.\nContemporary Western culture has little sympathy for Augustine\u2019s\nyearning for an inner divine light or for his less than optimistic\nviews about human autonomy and the secular. Nevertheless, the richness\nof his thought continues to fascinate readers. \n",
