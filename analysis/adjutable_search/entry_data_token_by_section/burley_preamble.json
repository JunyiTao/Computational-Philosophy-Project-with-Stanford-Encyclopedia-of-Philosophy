    "main_text": "\n\nWalter Burley, or Burleigh, (ca. 1275\u20131344) was one of the most\nprominent and influential philosophers of the fourteenth century. He\nhad a very long career in both England and France, becoming Master of\nArts at Oxford by 1301 and Master of Theology at Paris by 1324. He\nproduced a large body of about fifty works, many of which were widely\nread in the later Middle Ages. Especially prominent were his last\ncommentaries on the Ars Vetus and Physics, which\nwere studied all over Europe and particularly at Italian universities\nduring the latter half of the fourteenth and the whole of the\nfifteenth centuries. His semantic and ontological views evolved during\nhis career in response to Ockham\u2019s acute criticism of traditional\nrealism, moving from the moderate realism typical of\nthirteenth-century theologians such as Thomas Aquinas and Henry of\nGhent to the extreme realism of his later writings, which posit the\nexistence of extramental universals really distinct from individual\nthings, extramental propositions as significates of true sentences,\nand real distinctions among the ten categories. According to Burley,\nall of this is necessary to preserve the validity of our knowledge of\nthe external world, which he believed can be made evident without\nfalling prey to Ockham\u2019s criticisms.\n",
