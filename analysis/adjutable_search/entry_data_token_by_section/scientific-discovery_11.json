    "main_text": "Methodologies of discovery || Preliminary appraisal\n8.2 Preliminary appraisal\n\nDiscoverability as described in the previous paragraphs is a mode of\njustification. Like the testing of novel predictions derived from a\nhypothesis, generative justification begins when the phase of finding\nand articulating a hypothesis worthy of assessing is drawing to a\nclose. Other approaches to the methodology of discovery are directly\nconcerned with the procedures involved in devising new hypotheses. The\nargument in favor of this kind of methodology is that the procedures\nof devising new hypotheses already include elements of appraisal.\nThese preliminary assessments have been termed \u201cweak\u201d\nevaluation procedures (Schaffner 1993). Weak evaluations are relevant\nduring the process of devising a new hypothesis. They provide reasons\nfor accepting a hypothesis as promising and worthy of further\nattention. Strong evaluations, by contrast, provide reasons for\naccepting a hypothesis as (approximately) true or confirmed. Both\n\u201cgenerative\u201d and \u201cconsequential\u201d testing as\ndiscussed in the previous section are strong evaluation procedures.\nStrong evaluation procedures are rigorous and systematically organized\naccording to the principles of hypothesis derivation or H-D testing. A\nmethodology of preliminary appraisal, by contrast, articulates\ncriteria for the evaluation of a hypothesis prior to rigorous\nderivation or testing. It aids the decision about whether to take that\nhypothesis seriously enough to develop it further and test it. For\nadvocates of this version of the methodology of discovery, it is the\ntask of philosophy of science to characterize sets of constraints and\nmethodological rules guiding the complex process of prior-to-test\nevaluation of hypotheses.\n\nIn contrast to the computational approaches discussed above,\nstrategies of preliminary appraisal are not regarded as\nsubject-neutral but as specific to particular fields of study.\nPhilosophers of biology, for instance, have developed a fine-grained\nframework to account for the generation and preliminary evaluation of\nbiological mechanisms (Darden 2002; Craver 2002; Bechtel and\nRichardson 1993; Craver and Darden 2013). Some philosophers have\nsuggested that the phase of preliminary appraisal be further divided\ninto two phases, the phase of appraising and the phase of revising.\nAccording to Lindley Darden, the phases of generation, appraisal and\nrevision of descriptions of mechanisms can be characterized as\nreasoning processes governed by reasoning strategies. Different\nreasoning strategies govern the different phases (Darden 1991, 2002;\nCraver 2002; Darden 2009). The generation of hypotheses about\nmechanisms, for instance, is governed by the strategy of \u201cschema\ninstantiation\u201d (see Darden 2002). The discovery of the mechanism\nof protein synthesis involved the instantiation of an abstract schema\nfor chemical reactions: reactant1 + reactant2 =\nproduct. The actual mechanism of protein synthesis was found through\nspecification and modification of this schema.\n\nNeither of these strategies is deemed necessary for discovery, and\nthey are not prescriptions for biological research. Rather, these\nstrategies are deemed sufficient for the discovery of mechanisms. The\nmethodology of the discovery of mechanisms is an extrapolation from\npast episodes of research on mechanisms and the result of a synthesis\nof rational reconstructions of several of these historical episodes.\nThe methodology of discovery is weakly normative in the sense that the\nstrategies for the discovery of mechanisms that were successful in the\npast may prove useful in future biological research (Darden 2002).\n",
