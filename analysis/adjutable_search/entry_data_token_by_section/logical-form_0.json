    "main_text": "Patterns of Reason\n1. Patterns of Reason\n\nOne ancient idea is that impeccable inferences exhibit patterns that\ncan be characterized schematically by abstracting away from the\nspecific contents of particular premises and conclusions, thereby\nrevealing a general form common to many other impeccable inferences.\nSuch forms, along with the inferences that exemplify them, are said to\nbe valid.\n\nGiven a valid inference, there is a sense in which the premises\ncontain the conclusion, which is correspondingly extractable from the\npremises. With regard to (1) and (7), it seems especially clear that\nthe conclusion is part of the first premise, and that the second\npremise is another part of the first.\n\n(1)\nJohn danced if Mary sang, and Mary sang; so John\ndanced.\n(7)\nChris swam if Pat was asleep, and Pat was asleep;\nso Chris swam.\n\n\nWe can express this point by saying that these inferences are\ninstances of the following form: B if\nA, and A; so B. The\n Stoics\n discussed several patterns of this kind, using ordinal numbers\n(instead of letters) to capture abstract forms like the ones shown\nbelow.\n\n\nIf the first then the second, and\nthe first; so the second.\n\nIf the first then the second, but\nnot the second; so not the\nfirst.\n\nEither the first or the second, but\nnot the second; so the first.\n\nNot both the first and the second,\nbut the first; so not the\nsecond.\n\n\nThese schematic formulations employ variables, indicated in bold.\nFollowing a long tradition, let\u2019s use the word\n\u2018proposition\u2019 as a term of art for whatever these\nvariables range over.\n Propositions\n are potential premises/conclusions, which can be endorsed or\nrejected. So they are, presumably, things that can be evaluated for\ntruth or falsity. This leaves room for various proposals about what\npropositions are: sentences, statements, states of affairs, etc. But\nlet\u2019s assume that declarative sentences can be used to express\npropositions; see, e.g., Cartwright (1962) and the essay on\n structured propositions.\n\nA significant complication is that in ordinary conversation, the\ncontext matters with regard to which proposition is expressed with a\ngiven sentence. For example, \u2018Pat is asleep\u2019 can be used\nat one time to express a true premise, and at another time to express\na false premise. A certain speaker might use \u2018I am tired\u2019\nto express a false proposition, while another speaker uses the same\nsentence at the same time to express a true proposition. What counts\nas being tired can also vary across conversations. Context\nsensitivity, of various kinds, is ubiquitous in typical discourse.\nMoreover, even given a context, a sentence like \u2018He is\nbald\u2019 may not express a unique proposition. (There may be no\nreferent for the pronoun; and even if there is, the\n vagueness\n of \u2018bald\u2019 may yield a range of candidate propositions,\nwith no fact of the matter as to which one is the proposition\nexpressed.) Still, we can and often do use sentences like \u2018Every\ncircle is an ellipse\u2019 and \u2018Thirteen is a prime\nnumber\u2019 to express premises of valid arguments. To be sure,\nmathematical examples are special cases. But the distinction between\nimpeccable and risky inferences is not limited to atypical contexts in\nwhich we try to think especially clearly about especially abstract\nmatters. So when focusing on the phenomenon of valid inference, we can\ntry to simplify the initial discussion by abstracting away from the\ncontext sensitivity of language use.\n\nAnother complication is that in speaking of an inference, one might be\ntalking about (i) a process in which a thinker draws a conclusion from\nsome premises, or (ii) some propositions, one of which is designated\nas an alleged consequence of the others; see, e.g., Harman (1973). But\nwe can describe a risky thought process as one in which a thinker who\naccepts certain propositions\u2014perhaps tentatively or\nhypothetically\u2014comes to accept, on that basis, a proposition\nthat does not follow from the initial premises. And it will be simpler\nto focus on premises/conclusions, as opposed to episodes of\nreasoning.\n\nWith regard to (1), the inference seems secure in part\nbecause its first premise has the form\n\u2018B if A\u2019.\n\n(1)\nJohn danced if Mary sang, and Mary sang; so John\ndanced.\n\n\nIf the first premise didn\u2019t have this form, the inference\nwouldn\u2019t be an instance of \u2018B if\nA, and A; so\nB\u2019. It isn\u2019t obvious that all\nimpeccable inferences are instances of a more general valid form, much\nless inferences whose impeccability is due to the forms of the\nrelevant propositions. But this thought has served as an ideal for the\nstudy of valid inference, at least since Aristotle\u2019s treatment\nof examples like (2).\n\n(2)\nEvery senator is a politician, and every politician\nis deceitful; so every senator is deceitful.\n\n\nAgain, the first premise seems to have several parts, each of which is\na part of the second premise or the conclusion. (In English, the\nindefinite article in \u2018Every senator is a politician\u2019\ncannot be omitted; likewise for \u2018Every politician is a\nliar\u2019. But at least for now, let\u2019s assume that in examples\nlike these, \u2018a\u2019 does not itself indicate a propositional\nconstituent.)\n Aristotle,\n predating the Stoics, noted that conditional claims like the\nfollowing are sure to be true: if (the property of) being a politician\nbelongs to every senator, and being deceitful belongs to every\npolitician, then being deceitful belongs to every senator.\nCorrespondingly, the inference pattern below is valid.\n\nEvery S is P, and every P is D; so\nevery S is D.\n\n\nAnd inference (2) seems to be valid because its parts exhibit this\npattern. Aristotle discussed many such forms of inference, called\nsyllogisms, involving propositions that can be expressed with\nquantificational words like \u2018every\u2019 and\n\u2018some\u2019. For example, the syllogistic patterns below are\nalso valid.\n\n\nEvery S is P, and some S is D; so\nsome P is D.\n\nSome S is P, and every P is D; so\nsome S is D.\n\nSome S is not P, every D is P; so\nsome S is not D.\n\n\nWe can rewrite the last two, so that each of the valid syllogisms\nabove is represented as having a first premise of the form\n\u2018Every S is P\u2019.\n\n\nEvery S is P, and some D is S; so\nsome D is P.\n\nEvery S is P, and some D is not P;\nso some D is not S.\n\n\nBut however the inferences are represented, the important point is\nthat the variables\u2014represented here in italics\u2014range over\ncertain parts of propositions. Intuitively, common nouns like\n\u2018politician\u2019 and adjectives like \u2018deceitful\u2019\nare general terms, since they can apply to more than one individual.\nAnd many propositions apparently contain correspondingly general\nelements. For example, the proposition that every senator is wealthy\ncontains two such elements, both relevant to the validity of\ninferences involving this proposition.\n\nPropositions thus seem to have structure that bears on the validity of\ninferences, even ignoring premises/conclusions with propositional\nparts. In this sense, even atomic propositions have logical form. And\nas Aristotle noted, pairs of such propositions can be related in\ninteresting ways. If every S is P, then some\nS is P. (For these purposes, assume there is at\nleast one S.) If no S is P, then some\nS is not P. It is certain that either every\nS is P or some S is not P; and\nwhichever of these propositions is true, the other is false.\nSimilarly, the following propositions cannot both be true: every\nS is P; and no S is P. But it\nisn\u2019t certain that either every S is P, or no\nS is P. Perhaps some S is P, and\nsome S is not P. This network of logical relations\nstrongly suggests that the propositions in question contain a\nquantificational element and two general elements\u2014and in some\ncases, an element of negation; see\n logic: classical.\n This raises the question of whether other propositions have a similar\nstructure.\n ",
