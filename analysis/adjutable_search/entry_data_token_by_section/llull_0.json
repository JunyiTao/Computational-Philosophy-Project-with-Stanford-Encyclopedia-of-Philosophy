    "main_text": "Life and his philosophical and religious project\n1. Life and his philosophical and religious project\n\nRamon Llull (also called Raymond Lully or Raymond Lull; in Latin,\nRaimundus or Raymundus Lullus or Lullius) lead an exceptional and\nextraordinarily fruitful life, unusually long for a medieval man,\nfilled with adventures and guided by his philosophical, religious, and\npolitical convictions, which invariably permeated his work. He was\nborn in Majorca in 1232, possibly in 1233. His parents, Ramon Amat\nLlull and Isabel d\u2019Erill, were members of a bourgeois\nmiddle-class family in Barcelona. In 1229 they encouraged and\nfinanced, alongside other Catalan merchants, the efforts of King James\nI of Aragon to conquer the island of Majorca, at that time under\nMuslim dominion, in exchange for land and privileges. Following the\ntriumph over the Moors, they received lands and moved to the island.\nRamon, their only son, was born there only a few years later.\n\nVery little is known about his early life. The main source regarding\nLlull\u2019s life, the anonymous De vita coaetanea, is a\ntext written in 1311 by a friend of his in Paris. Apparently based on\nhis memories, it states that Llull was a seneschal and major of the\npalace of King James II during his youth. However, contemporary\nstudies by Dominguez Reboiras and Gay\u00e1 (2008) have established\nthat the \u201cLlulls of Majorca never held nor were they awarded the\nsocial status of nobles\u201d (2008: 21). Ramon Llull must have\nactually spent the early years of his life as a young bourgeois,\nhaving a basic education to meet his needs and dedicating himself to\nfamily business. In 1257 he married Blanca Picany, who belonged to\nanother Catalan family settled in Majorca, with whom he had two\nchildren, Dom\u00e8nec and Magdalena.\n",
