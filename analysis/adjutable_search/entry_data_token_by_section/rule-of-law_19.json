    "main_text": "Controversies about Application || Law and Social Norms\n8.3 Law and Social Norms\n\nSometimes situations can be governed and disputes settled by informal\nsocial norms rather than by positive law, formally enacted and\nenforced (Ellickson 1994). Opinions differ as to whether this should\nbe regarded as something altogether different from the Rule of Law. On\nthe one hand, it looks like a genuine alternative, and little is\ngained by assimilating its desirable features, such as they are, to\nRule-of-Law requirements. On the other hand, it does have something in\ncommon with understandings of customary law and conceptions of the\nRule of Law (like that of Hayek 1973) that try to separate themselves\nfrom enactment and legislation. Also it is sometimes said that the\nRule of Law works best when what is enforced in a society can be\nmapped on to its members\u2019 norms of fairness and common-sense.\nThis makes social participation in the integrity and upholding of law\nmore likely (Cooter 1997). The closer this mapping, the less of an\ninvestment there has to be in formal legal promulgation: ordinary\nknow-how can become a reliable guide to legal knowledge. However, one\nhas to be very cautious with this. Modern law is inevitably technical\nin ways that far outstrip the possibilities of intuitive understanding\n(Weber 1968 [1922]: 882\u201395). The best that can be hoped for is\nsome sort of occasional consonance between enacted law and informal\nunderstandings, and the sporadic character of that may well heighten\nrather than reduce unpredictability. \n",
