    "main_text": "The moral issue || Consequentialism\n2.2 Consequentialism\n\nAdherents of consequentialism judge terrorism, like every other\npractice, solely by its consequences. Terrorism is not considered\nwrong in itself, but only if it has bad consequences on balance. The\ninnocence of the victims does not change that. This is an instance of\na general trait of consequentialism often highlighted by its critics,\nfor example in the debate about the moral justification of legal\npunishment. A standard objection to the consequentialist approach to\npunishment has been that it implies that punishment of the innocent is\njustified, when its consequences are good on balance. This objection\ncan only get off the ground because consequentialism denies that in\nsuch matters a person\u2019s innocence is morally significant in\nitself.\n\nThose who consider terrorism from a consequentialist point of view\ndiffer in their assessment of its morality. Their judgment on\nterrorism depends on their view of the good to be promoted by its use\nand on their assessment of the utility of terrorism as a means of\npromoting it. There is room for disagreement on both issues.\n2.2.1 Terrorism justified\n\nKai Nielsen approaches questions to do with political violence in\ngeneral and terrorism in particular as a consequentialist in ethics\nand a socialist in politics. The use of neither can be ruled out\ncategorically; it all depends on their utility as a method for\nattaining morally and politically worthwhile objectives such as\n\u201ca truly socialist society\u201d or liberation from colonial\nrule. \u201cWhen and where [either] should be employed is a tactical\nquestion that must be decided \u2026 on a case-by-case basis\n\u2026 like the choice of weapon in a war\u201d (Nielsen 1981:\n435). Nielsen has a wide definition of terrorism, but his examples\nshow that the innocence of the victims of terrorism makes no\ndifference to its justification\u2014that is, that his conclusions\napply to terrorism in both the wide and narrow sense. In his view,\n\nterrorist acts must be justified by their political effects and their\nmoral consequences. They are justified (1) when they are politically\neffective weapons in the revolutionary struggle and (2) when,\neverything considered, there are sound reasons for believing that, by\nthe use of that type of violence rather than no violence at all or\nviolence of some other type, there will be less injustice, suffering\nand degradation in the world than would otherwise have been the case\n(Nielsen 1981: 446).\n\n\nHistorical experience, in Nielsen\u2019s view, tells us that\nterrorism on a small scale, used as the sole method of struggle in\norder to provoke the masses into revolutionary action, is ineffective\nand often counterproductive. On the other hand, terrorism employed in\nconjunction with guerrilla warfare in a protracted war of liberation\nmay well prove useful and therefore also justified, as it did in\nAlgeria and South Vietnam. (For an earlier statement of the same view,\nsee Trotsky 1961: 48\u201359, 62\u201365.)\n2.2.2 Terrorism unjustified\n\nNicholas Fotion also uses a wide definition of terrorism. He, too, is\na consequentialist (although some of his remarks concerning the\ninnocence of many victims of terrorism might be more at home in\nnonconsequentialist ethics). But he finds standard consequentialist\nassessments of terrorism such as Nielsen\u2019s too permissive. If\nsome types of terrorism are justifiable under certain circumstances,\nsuch circumstances will be extremely rare. Terrorists and their\napologists do not perform the requisite calculations properly. One\nproblem is the \u201chigher good\u201d to be promoted by terrorism:\nmore often than not, it is defined in ideological terms, rather than\nderived from settled preferences or interests of actual people. But\nfor the most part Fotion discusses the issue of means. If a terrorist\nact or campaign is to be justified instrumentally, it must be shown\n(1) that the end sought is good enough to justify the means, (2) that\nthe end will indeed be achieved by means of terrorism, and (3) that\nthe end cannot be achieved in any other way that is morally and\notherwise less costly. Terrorists not only, as a matter of fact, fail\nto discharge this burden; Fotion argues that, with regard to terrorism\nthat victimizes innocent people, it cannot be discharged. All direct\nvictims of terrorism are treated as objects to be used\u2014indeed,\nused up\u2014by the terrorist. But\n\nin being treated as an object, the innocent victim is worse off than\nthe (alleged) guilty victim. Insofar as the latter is judged to have\ndone a wrong, he is thought of as a human. [\u2026] For the\nterrorist the innocent victim is neither a human in this judgmental\nsense nor a human in the sense of simply having value as a\nhuman being. Of course the terrorist needs to pick a human being as a\nvictim \u2026 because [that] brings about more terror \u2026 But\nthis does not involve treating them as humans. Rather, they\nare victimized and thereby treated as objects because they\nare humans (Fotion 1981: 464).\n\n\nIn reply, terrorists can claim that they advisedly sacrifice valued\nhuman beings for a higher good. But for this claim to carry any\nconviction, they would have to show that they have no alternative.\nYet, Fotion argues, they always have the alternative of\ntaking on the opponent\u2019s military establishment, and often also\nhave the option of going after government officials responsible for\nthe wrongs they object to, instead of attacking innocent persons. That\nkind of terrorism may sometimes be justified, whereas terrorism that\ntargets innocent people never is.\n2.3 Nonconsequentialism\n\nWithin a nonconsequentialist approach to morality, terrorism is\nconsidered wrong in itself, because of what it is, rather than only\nbecause (and insofar as) its consequences are bad on balance. But this\nis not to say that this approach leaves no room whatever for morally\njustifying certain acts or campaigns of terrorism. Indeed,\nnonconsequentialist discussions of terrorism also present a range of\npositions and arguments.\n\nA nonconsequentialist might try to justify an act or campaign of\nterrorism in one of two ways. One might invoke some deontological\nconsiderations, such as justice or rights, in favor of resorting to\nterrorism under certain circumstances. Alternatively, one might argue\nthat the obvious, and obviously very weighty, considerations of rights\n(of the victims of terrorism) and justice (which demands respect for\nthose rights) may sometimes be overridden by extremely weighty\nconsiderations of consequences\u2014an extremely high price that\nwould be paid for not resorting to terrorism. For the\nrejection of consequentialism is of course not tantamount to denying\nthat consequences of our actions, policies, and practices matter in\ntheir moral assessment; what is denied is the consequentialists\u2019\nclaim that only consequences matter.\n2.3.1 Basic human rights and distributive justice\n\nVirginia Held operates with a broad notion of terrorism, but her\njustification of terrorism is meant to apply to terrorism that targets\ncommon citizens. Her discussion of the subject focuses on the issue of\nrights. When rights of a person or group are not respected, what may\nwe do in order to ensure that they are? On one view, known as\nconsequentialism of rights, if the only way to ensure respect of a\ncertain right of A and B is to infringe the same\nright of C, we shall be justified in doing so. Held does not\nhold that such trade-offs in rights with the aim of maximizing their\nrespect in a society are appropriate. Yet rights sometimes come into\nconflict, whether directly or indirectly (as in the above example).\nWhen that happens, there is no way we can avoid comparing the rights\ninvolved as more or less stringent and making certain choices between\nthem. That applies to the case of terrorism too. Terrorism obviously\nviolates some human rights of its victims. But its advocates claim\nthat in some circumstances a limited use of terrorism is the only way\nof bringing about a society where human rights of all will be\nrespected.\n\nEven when this claim is true, that is not enough to make resort to\nterrorism justified. But it will be justified if an additional\ncondition is met: that of distributive justice. If there is a society\nwhere the human rights of a part of the population are respected,\nwhile the same rights of another part of the population are being\nviolated; if the only way of changing that and ensuring that human\nrights of all are respected is a limited use of terrorism; finally, if\nterrorism is directed against members of the first group, which up to\nnow has been privileged as far as respect of human rights is\nconcerned\u2014then terrorism will be morally justified. This is a\njustification in terms of distributive justice, applied to the problem\nof violations of human rights. It is more just to equalize the\nviolations of human rights in a stage of transition to a society where\nthe rights of all are respected, than to allow that the group which\nhas already suffered large-scale violations of human rights suffer\neven more such violations (assuming that in both cases we are dealing\nwith violations of the same, or equally stringent, human rights). The\nhuman rights of many are going to be violated in any case; it is more\njust, and therefore morally preferable, that their violations should\nbe distributed in a more equitable way (Held 2008).\n\nIt might be objected that in calling for sacrificing such basic human\nrights as the right to life and to bodily security of\nindividual victims of terrorism for the sake of a more just\ndistribution of violations of the same rights within a group\nin the course of transition to a stage where these rights will be\nrespected throughout that group, Held offends against the principles\nof separateness of persons and respect for persons (Primoratz 1997:\n230\u201331). In response, Held argues that\n\nto fail to achieve a more just distribution of violations of rights\n(through the use of terrorism if that is the only means available) is\nto fail to recognize that those whose rights are already not fairly\nrespected are individuals in their own right, not merely members of a\ngroup \u2026 whose rights can be ignored.\n\n\nAn argument for achieving a just distribution of rights violations is\nnot necessarily about groups; it can be an argument about the rights\nof individuals to fairness (Held 2008: 89\u201390). (For further\nobjections to Held\u2019s argument, see Steinhoff 2007: 125\u201330; Brooks 2010;\nNath 2011.)\n2.3.2 Supreme emergency and moral disaster\n\nIn Held\u2019s justification of terrorism, it is justice that\nrequires that inescapable violations of human rights be more evenly\ndistributed. There is a different way of allowing for the use of\nterrorism under certain circumstances within a nonconsequentialist\napproach to the ethics of violence. It could be argued that, as far as\njustice and rights are concerned, terrorism (or, in Held\u2019s\nterminology, the kind of terrorism that targets the innocent) is never\njustified. Furthermore, considerations of justice and rights carry\nmuch greater weight than considerations of good and bad consequences,\nand therefore normally trump the latter in cases of conflict. However,\nin exceptional circumstances considerations concerning\nconsequences\u2014the price of not resorting to\nterrorism\u2014may be so extremely weighty as to override those of\njustice and rights.\n\nMichael Walzer offers an argument along these lines in his discussion\nof \u201cterror bombing\u201d of German cities in World War II. In\nearly 1942, it seemed that Britain would be defeated by Germany and\nthat its military could not prevail while fighting in accordance with\nthe rules of war. Britain was the only remaining obstacle to the\nsubjugation of most of Europe by the Nazis. That was \u201can\nultimate threat to everything decent in our lives, an ideology and a\npractice of domination so murderous, so degrading even to those who\nmight survive, that the consequences of its final victory were\nliterally beyond calculation, immeasurably awful\u201d (Walzer 2000:\n253). Thus Britain was facing a \u201csupreme emergency\u201d: an\n(a) imminent threat of (b) something utterly unthinkable from a moral\npoint of view. In such an emergency\u2014a case of the \u201cdirty\nhands\u201d predicament that so often plagues political action (see\nWalzer 1973)\u2014one may breach a basic and weighty moral principle\nsuch as civilian immunity, if that is the only hope of fending off the\nthreat. So for more than three years, the RAF, later joined by the\nUSAAF, deliberately devastated many German cities, killed about\n600,000 civilians and seriously injured another 800,000 in an attempt\nto terrorize the German people into forcing their leadership to halt\nthe war and surrender unconditionally. By early 1943 it was clear that\nGermany was not going to win the war, and all subsequent terror\nbombing lacked moral justification. But in its first year, in\nWalzer\u2019s view, the terror bombing of Germany was morally\njustified as a response to the supreme emergency Britain was facing.\nWalzer then expands the notion of supreme emergency to apply to a\nsingle political community facing the threat of extermination or\nenslavement, and eventually to a single political community whose\n\u201csurvival and freedom\u201d are at stake. For \u201cthe\nsurvival and freedom of political communities\u2014whose members\nshare a way of life, developed by their ancestors, to be passed on to\ntheir children\u2014are the highest values of international\nsociety\u201d (Walzer 2000: 254).\n\nHere we have two different conceptions of supreme emergency. The\nthreat is imminent in both, but the nature of the threat differs: it\nis one thing to suffer the fate the Nazis had in store for peoples\nthey considered racially inferior, and another to have one\u2019s\npolity dismantled. By moving back and forth between these two types of\nsupreme emergency under the ambiguous heading of threat to \u201cthe\nsurvival and freedom of a political community\u201d, Walzer seeks to\nextend to the latter the moral response that might be appropriate to\nthe former. Yet whereas genocide, expulsion, or enslavement of an\nentire people might be thought a moral disaster that may be\nfended off by any means, its loss of political independence is, at\nmost, a political disaster. If a polity to be dismantled\nlacks moral legitimacy, its demise may well be a moral improvement.\nBut even if a polity does have moral legitimacy, a threat to its\n\u201csurvival and freedom\u201d falls short of \u201can ultimate\nthreat to everything decent in our lives\u201d. If so, its military\ncannot be justified in waging war on enemy civilians in order to\ndefend it. (On supreme emergencies see, for instance,\nStatman 2006; Kaplan 2011.)\n\nThere is another, less permissive position constructed along similar\nlines, but based on a more austere view of what counts as a moral\ndisaster that might justify resort to terrorism. Contrary to what many\nfighters against social or economic oppression, colonial rule, or\nforeign occupation believe, evils of such magnitude that they can\njustify indiscriminate killing and maiming of innocent people are\nextremely rare. Not every case of oppression, foreign rule, or\noccupation, however morally indefensible, amounts to a moral disaster\nin the relevant sense. Nor does every imminent threat to \u201cthe\nsurvival and freedom of a political community\u201d qualify, contrary\nto what Walzer has argued. However, if an entire people is subjected\nto extermination, or to an attempt at \u201cethnically\ncleansing\u201d it from its land, then it is facing a true moral\ndisaster and may properly consider terrorism as a method of struggle\nagainst such a fate. In view of their enormity and finality,\nextermination and \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of an entire people\nconstitute a category apart. To be sure, resorting to terrorism in\nsuch a case will be morally justified only if there are very good\ngrounds for believing that terrorism will succeed where nothing else\nwill: in preventing imminent extermination or \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d, or stopping it if it is already under way. Cases\nwhere both conditions are met will be extremely rare. Indeed, history\nmay not offer a single example. But that does not mean that no\nact or campaign of terrorism could ever satisfy these conditions and\nthus turn out to be justified. Accordingly, terrorism is\nalmost absolutely wrong (Primoratz 2013: chapter 6).\n\nBoth the \u201csupreme emergency\u201d and the \u201cmoral\ndisaster\u201d view will justify a resort to terrorism only when that\nis the only way to deal with the emergency, or to prevent the\ndisaster, respectively. Just how certain must we be that terrorism\nwill indeed achieve the goal, while no other method will? One might\nargue that when in extremis, we cannot apply stringent\nepistemic standards in deciding how to cope\u2014indeed, if we cannot\nreally know what will work, we must take our chances with what might.\nThis is Walzer\u2019s view: in such a predicament, we must\n\u201cwager\u201d the crime of terrorism against the evil that is\notherwise in store for us. \u201cThere is no option; the risk\notherwise is too great\u201d (Walzer 2000: 259\u2013260). It may be\nobjected that this position highlights the enormity of the threat,\nwhile failing to give due weight to the enormity of the means proposed\nfor fending off the threat\u2014the enormity of terrorism, of\ndeliberately killing and maiming innocent people. When that is taken\ninto account, the conclusion may rather be that even in\nextremis, if terrorism is to be justified, the reasons for\nbelieving that it will work and that nothing else will must be very\nstrong indeed.\n2.3.3 Terrorism absolutely wrong\n\nSome hold that terrorism is absolutely wrong. This position, too,\ncomes in different versions. Some philosophers work with a wide\ndefinition of terrorism, and argue that under certain circumstances\n\u201cselective\u201d terrorism that targets only those seriously\nimplicated in the wrongs at issue may be justified (Corlett 2003,\nYoung 2004). This seems to suggest that terrorism which is not\nselective in this way\u2014that is, terrorism in the narrow\nsense\u2014is never justified. Yet this does not follow: there is\nstill room for arguing that terrorism of the latter type can be\njustified by further considerations, such as those of \u201csupreme\nemergency\u201d or \u201cmoral disaster\u201d.\n\nPer Bauhn does not leave it at that. He attempts to show that\nterrorism that targets non-combatants or common citizens can never be\njustified by deploying a slightly amended version of Alan\nGewirth\u2019s ethical theory. Freedom and safety are fundamental\nprerequisites of action and therefore must be accorded paramount\nweight. The need to protect them generates a range of rights; the\nright pertinent here is \u201can absolute right not to be made the\nintended victims of a homicidal project\u201d all innocent persons\nhave (Gewirth 1981: 16). When the absolute status of this right is\nchallenged by invoking supreme emergency or moral disaster, Bauhn\nargues that there is a moral difference between what we are positively\nand directly causally responsible for, and what we are causally\nresponsible for only indirectly, by failing to prevent other persons\nfrom intentionally bringing it about. We are morally responsible for\nthe former, but (except in certain special circumstances) not for the\nlatter. If we refuse to resort to terrorism in order not to target\ninnocent persons, and thus fail to prevent some other persons from\nperpetrating atrocities, it is only the perpetrators who will be\nmorally responsible for those atrocities. Therefore we must refuse\n(Bauhn 1989: chapter 5).\n\nSome philosophers base their absolute rejection of terrorism on the\nslippery slope argument, and argue that \u201cthe appeal to supreme\nemergency is too dangerous to be allowed as a publicly available\nvindication for terrorism, no matter how rare the circumstances are\nmeant to be\u201d (Coady 2021: 143\u201344).\n\nStephen Nathanson seeks to ground the absolute immunity of civilians\nor common citizens and the absolute prohibition of terrorism which it\nentails in a rule-consequentialist ethical theory (Nathanson 2010:\n191\u2013208). Adopting civilian immunity, rather than adopting any\nother rule regulating the matter or having no rule at all, is the best\nway to reduce the killing and destruction in armed conflict. Moreover,\nthe best consequences will be achieved by adopting it as an absolute\nrule, rather than as a rule allowing for exceptions in supreme\nemergencies. The idea of supreme emergency is vague. The criteria for\nproffering supreme emergency exemptions are liable to be applied in\narbitrary and subjective ways. Finally, there is the slippery slope\nargument: \u201cpermitting [departures from the rule of civilian\nimmunity, including terrorism] even under the direst circumstances\nwill lower the bar for justifying such acts \u2026 broadcast the\nmessage that such behavior may sometimes be justified and \u2026\nthus lend its weight to increasing the use of such methods\u201d\n(Nathanson 2010: 207).\n\nHowever, one can adopt rule-consequentialism as one\u2019s ethical\ntheory and yet view the immunity of civilians or common citizens and\nthe attendant prohibition of terrorism as very stringent, but not\nabsolute moral rules. Thus Richard B. Brandt and Brad Hooker do not\nview this immunity as absolute. They argue that a set of moral rules\nselected because of the good consequences of their adoption should\ninclude a rule that allows and indeed requires one to prevent disaster\neven if that means breaking some other moral rule. Even such a\nstringent moral rule as the prohibition of deliberate use of violence\nagainst innocent people may be overridden, if the disaster that cannot\nbe prevented in any other way is grave enough. (See Brandt 1992:\n87\u201388, 150\u201351, 156\u201357; Hooker 2000: 98\u201399,\n127\u201336). There is thus some convergence at the level of\npractical conclusions between their understanding of the immunity of\ncivilians or common citizens and the \u201cmoral disaster\u201d\nposition outlined above (2.3.2).",
