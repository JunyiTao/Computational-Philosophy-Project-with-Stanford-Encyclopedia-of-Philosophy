    "main_text": "The Hardy-Weinberg Principle\n2. The Hardy-Weinberg Principle\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle, discovered independently by G.H. Hardy\nand W. Weinberg in 1908, is one of the simplest and most important\nprinciples in population genetics (Hardy 1908, Weinberg 1908). To\nillustrate the principle, consider a large population of sexually\nreproducing organisms. The organisms are diploids, meaning\nthat they contain two copies of each chromosome, one received from\neach parent. The gametes they produce are haploid, meaning\nthat they contain only one of each chromosome pair. During sexual\nfusion, two haploid gametes fuse to form a diploid zygote, which then\ngrows and develops into an adult organism. Most multi-celled animals\nand many plants have a lifecycle of this sort.\n\nSuppose that at a given locus, or chromosomal \u2018slot\u2019,\nthere are two possible alleles, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\); the locus is\nassumed to be on an autosome, not a sex chromosome. With respect to\nthe locus in question, there are three possible genotypes in the\npopulation, \\(A_1 A_1, A_1 A_2\\) and \\(A_2 A_2\\) (just as in\nMendel\u2019s pea plant example above). Organisms with the \\(A_1\nA_1\\) and \\(A_2 A_2\\) genotypes are called homozygotes;\nthose with the \\(A_1 A_2\\) genotype are heterozygotes. The\nproportions, or relative frequencies, of the three genotypes in the\noverall population may be denoted \\(f(A_1 A_1), f(A_1 A_2)\\) and\n\\(f(A_2 A_2)\\) respectively, where \\(f(A_1 A_1) + f(A_1 A_2) + f(A_2\nA_2) = 1\\). It is assumed that these genotypic frequencies are the\nsame for both males and females. The relative frequencies of the \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) alleles in the population are denoted \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), where\n\\(p = f(A_1 A_1) + \\frac{1}{2}f(A_1 A_2)\\) and \\(q = f(A_2 A_2) +\n\\frac{1}{2}f(A_1 A_2).\\) Note that \\(p + q = 1\\).\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle is about the relation between the allelic\nand the genotypic frequencies. It states that if mating is random in\nthe population, and if natural selection, mutation, migration and\ndrift are absent, then in the offspring generation the genotypic and\nallelic frequencies will be related by the following simple\nequations:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nf(A_1 A_1) &= p^2, \\\\\nf(A_1 A_2) &= 2pq, \\\\\nf(A_2 A_2) &= q^2\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nRandom mating means the absence of a genotypic correlation between\nmating partners, i.e., the probability that a given organism mates\nwith an \\(A_1 A_1\\) partner, for example, does not depend on the\norganism\u2019s own genotype, and similarly for the other two\ngenotypes.\n\nThat random mating will lead the genotypes to be in the above\nproportions (\u201cHardy-Weinberg proportions\u201d) is a\nconsequence of Mendel\u2019s law of segregation. To see this, note\nthat random mating is in effect equivalent to offspring being formed\nby randomly picking pairs of gametes from a large \u2018gamete\npool\u2019 and fusing them into a zygote. The gamete pool contains\nall the successful gametes of the parent organisms. Since we are\nassuming the absence of selection, all parents contribute equal\nnumbers of gametes to the pool. By the law of segregation, an \\(A_1\nA_2\\) heterozygote produces gametes bearing the \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\)\nalleles in equal proportion (on average). Therefore, the relative\nfrequencies of the \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) alleles in the gamete pool will be\nthe same as in the parental population, namely \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)\nrespectively. Given that the gamete pool is very large, when we pick\npairs of gametes from the pool at random, we will get the ordered\ngenotypic pairs \\(\\{A_1 A_1\\},\\) \\(\\{A_1 A_2\\},\\) \\(\\{A_2 A_1\\},\\)\n\\(\\{A_2 A_2\\}\\) in the proportions \\(p^2 :pq:qp:q^2\\).  But order does\nnot matter, so we can regard the \\(\\{A_1 A_2\\}\\) and \\(\\{A_2 A_1\\}\\)\npairs as equivalent, giving the Hardy-Weinberg proportions for the\nunordered offspring genotypes.\n\nThis simple derivation of the Hardy-Weinberg principle deals with two\nalleles at a single locus, but can easily be extended to multiple\nalleles. (Extension to more than one locus is trickier; see section\n3.6 below.) For the multi-allelic case, suppose there are \\(n\\)\nalleles at the locus, \\(A_1 \\ldots A_n\\), with relative frequencies of\n\\(p_1 \\ldots p_n\\) respectively, where \\(p_1 + p_2 + \\ldots + p_n =\n1\\). Assuming again that the population is large, mating is random,\nevolutionary forces are absent, and Mendel\u2019s law of segregation\nholds, then in the offspring generation the frequency of the\n\\(A_i A_i\\) genotype will be \\(p_i^2\\), and the frequency of\nthe (unordered) \\(A_i A_j\\) genotype \\((i \\ne j)\\) will be\n\\(2p_i p_j\\). Note that the two allele case is a special case\nof this generalized principle.\n\nImportantly, whatever the initial genotypic proportions, random mating\nwill automatically produce offspring in Hardy-Weinberg proportions\n(for one-locus genotypes). So if generations are non-overlapping,\ni.e., parents die as soon as they have reproduced, just one round of\nrandom mating is needed to bring about Hardy-Weinberg proportions in\nthe whole population; if generations overlap, more than one round of\nrandom mating is needed. Once Hardy-Weinberg proportions have been\nachieved, they will be maintained in subsequent generations so long as\nthe population continues to mate at random and is unaffected by\nevolutionary forces. The population is then said to be in\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium\u2014meaning that the genotypic\nfrequencies are constant from generation to generation.\n\nThe importance of the Hardy-Weinberg principle lies in the fact that\nit contains the solution to the problem of blending inheritance that\ntroubled Darwin. Jenkin\u2019s argument that sexual reproduction will\nrapidly diminish the variation in a population is disproved by the\nHardy-Weinberg principle. Sexual reproduction has no inherent tendency\nto destroy genotypic variation, for the genotypic proportions remain\nconstant over generations, given the assumptions noted above. It is\ntrue that natural selection often tends to destroy variation,\nand is thus a homogenizing force; but this is a quite different\nmatter. The \u2018blending\u2019 objection was that sexual mixing\nitself would produce homogeneity, even in the absence of\nselection, and the Hardy-Weinberg principle shows that this is\nuntrue.\n\nAnother benefit of the Hardy-Weinberg principle is that it greatly\nsimplifies the task of modelling evolutionary change. When a\npopulation is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, it is possible to track\nthe genotypic composition of the population by directly tracking the\nallelic frequencies (or gametic frequencies). That this is so is\nclear\u2014for if we know the relative frequencies of all the alleles\n(at a single locus), and know that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg\nequilibrium, the entire genotype frequency distribution can be easily\ncomputed. Were the population not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we\nwould need to explicitly track the genotype frequencies themselves,\nwhich is more complicated.\n\nPrimarily for this reason, many population-genetic models assume that\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium obtains; this is tantamount to assuming\nthat mating is random with respect to genotype. But is this assumption\nempirically plausible? The answer is sometimes but not always. In the\nhuman population, for example, mating is close to random with respect\nto ABO blood group, so the genotype that determines blood group is\nfound in approximately Hardy-Weinberg proportions in many populations\n(Hartl and Clark 2006). But mating is not random with respect to\nheight; on the contrary, people tend to choose mates similar in height\nto themselves. So if we consider a genotype that influences height,\nmating will not be random with respect to this genotype (see section\n3.4 \u2018Non-Random Mating\u2019).\n\nThe population geneticist W.J. Ewens has written of the Hardy-Weinberg\nprinciple, \u201cit does not often happen that the most important\ntheorem in any subject is the easiest and most readily derived theorem\nfor that subject\u201d (1969, p. 1). The main importance of the\nprinciple, as Ewens stresses, is not the gain in mathematical\nsimplicity that it permits, which is simply a beneficial side effect,\nbut rather what it teaches us about the preservation of genetic\nvariation in a sexually reproducing population.\n",
