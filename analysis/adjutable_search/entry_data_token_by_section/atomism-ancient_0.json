Atomism in Classical Indian Philosophy\n\nThe beginnings of atomism in classical Indian philosophy are difficult\nto ascertain, but it likely has origins several centuries before the\ncommon era. Two distinct systems that regard Vedic texts as\nauthoritative, Ny\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, favoured atomist\naccounts of the material world. Quite different atomist theories are\nfound in Buddhist and Jaina systems. Other Indian philosophical\nsystems were critical of atomism, arguing instead for an idealist\naccount of experience. The Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu (5th c.\nCE), whose earlier Treasury of Metaphysics is often\nconsidered an atomist account, critiqued atomism in his Twenty\nVerses.\n\nThe terms translated \u2018atom\u2019 in Indian philosophy\n(a\u1e47u, param\u0101\u1e47u) refer\nprimarily to the smallness of parts (Gangopadhyaya 1980): this notion\nof smallness, found in the Upanishads, was developed into atomist\ntheories in the commentary tradition. A classic argument for atomism\nreasons by analogy from the fact that perceptible objects seem to be\ncomposed of parts (Chatterjee 2017). Yet, the argument ran, bodies\ncannot be infinitely divisible because this would lead to the\nparadoxical result that a mountain and a mustard seed would be equal\nin size. This rebuttal\u2014closely echoed in Islamic\ndebates\u2014is based on the kind of paradox about summation of\ninfinite series also found in the ancient Greek tradition (Bhaduri\n1947, 55). The comparison of mountain and mustard seed was also\ndeployed to argue that the concepts of small and large would be\nindistinguishable unless smallness had a defined magnitude\n(Gangopadhyaya 1980, 29).\n\nNot all Indian atomist theories regard minima as substantial entities.\nCarpenter (2021) describes the trope theory of Vasubandhu as\n\u2018absolute atomism\u2019: this characterization challenges the\nnotion that atomism canonically centres on the positing of enduring\nparticles. Instead, the focus is on minimal units in time as well as\nspace, which are simultaneously minimal components of ontological\nunits and not substance-attribute composites.\n\nA tradition that the Greek atomist Democritus was acquainted with the\nideas of the \u2018gymnosophists\u2019 or \u2018naked wise\nmen\u2019 of India is difficult to authenticate. Claims that Indian\natomism was shaped by Greek influences (Keith 1921, 17) are uncommon\nin recent scholarship. The possibility that Islamic atomism was\nimpacted by debates in classical Indian philosophy has been more\nextensively considered, particularly given parallel arguments and the\nshared view that atoms never exist in isolation (Pines 1997; Wolfson\n1976). Another feature common to both traditions is a willingness to\nascribe sensible qualities to atoms, in contrast to Greek atomist\ntheories. Indian Buddhist scholars introduced atomist theories to\nChina from the second century CE onward, but they seem not to have\nbeen adopted into ancient Chinese natural philosophy (Needham 1969,\n22).\n",
