    "main_text": "\n1. Intuitionist epistemology\n1.1 Intuition\n \n\nOne of the most distinctive features of Ethical Intuitionism is\nits epistemology. All of the classic intuitionists maintained that\nbasic moral propositions are self-evident\u2014that is, evident in\nand of themselves\u2014and so can be known without the need of any\nargument. Price distinguishes intuition from two other grounds of\nknowledge\u2014namely, immediate consciousness or feeling on the one\nhand, and argumentation, on the other. Argumentation, or deduction, is\nknowledge that is ultimately derived from what is immediately\napprehended, either by sensation or by the understanding. Immediate\nconsciousness, or feeling, is the mind\u2019s awareness of its own\nexistence and mental states (Price, 1758/1969, 159). It shares\nimmediacy with intuition, but unlike intuition does not have as its\nobject a self-evident proposition. Such immediate self-consciousness\nis immediate apprehension by sensation. Intuition is immediate\napprehension by the understanding. It is the way that we apprehend\nself-evident truths, general and abstract ideas, \u201cand anything\nelse we may discover, without making any use of any process of\nreasoning\u201d (1758/1969, 159).\n\n\nThe claim that intuition is immediate apprehension by the\nunderstanding suggests a notion of intuition in Price that is more\nakin to current accounts of intuitions as intellectual seemings or\npresentations (Bealer 1998; Chudnoff 2013). Intellectual seemings are\nthe intellectual analogue of perceptual seemings. Just as certain\nthings can seem perceptually to be a certain way, e.g., coloured, or\nstraight, so certain propositions can seem to be true, or present\nthemselves to the mind as true. These seemings are not beliefs, for\nsomething can seem true even though one does not believe it, e.g., it\nmay seem true that there are more natural numbers than even numbers,\nbut we know that is false, so do not believe it.\n\n\nSimilarly, on Price\u2019s view, an intuition isn\u2019t a belief\nwith certain characteristics, such as being pre-theoretical,\nnon-derivative, firmly held, etc. Beliefs aren\u2019t immediate\napprehensions of anything, though they may be based on such\napprehensions. One might be tempted to think that perceptual beliefs,\nsuch as the belief that there is a cat asleep in front of me, are\nimmediate apprehensions, but that would be to confuse the perceptual\napprehension of the cat with the belief based on that apprehension.\nBeliefs like this, perceptual beliefs, are based on the immediate\nexperience (sensory intuition) I have of a cat sleeping in front of\nme; they are not the sensory intuition itself. As Price understands\nit, then, an intellectual intuition is something closely akin to an\nexperiential presentation, or seeming.\n\n\nThe main difference between early intuitionists\u2019 notion of intuition\nand intellectual seemings is that the latter is standardly regarded as\nnon-factive\u2014that is, an intuition that p in this sense does\nnot entail that p. An apprehension that p does sound factive,\nhowever. One cannot apprehend something that is not there to be\napprehended. What is present to the mind in apprehension is the thing\nitself, not our representation of it. So whereas modern\nepistemologists regard intuition, understood as an intellectual\nseeming or presentation, as something analogous to the non-factive\nnotion of a perceptual experience, it looks like some classic\nintuitionists regarded intuition as analogous to the factive notion of\na perception. The virtue of the modern, more modest notion of\nintuition is that it allows that intuition is fallible. But in doing\nthis it loses the appeal of the direct realist account Price seems to\nwork with of certain propositions or facts being immediately present\nto the mind.\n\n\nThere is scope for intuitionists to be disjunctivist about such\nintuitions. They could maintain that some intuitions are\napprehensions, and some are intellectual seemings. Subjectively we\ncannot tell one from the other, but they are, one might argue, very\ndifferent states. But it is not evident that anyone has defended such\na view of intuition.\n\n\nIt is not clear that all intuitionists understand intuitions on this\nperceptual or quasi-perceptual model, as many do not use this notion\nat all. W. D. Ross, for example, uses the notion of apprehension, but\nhe tends to base his moral theory largely on our considered moral\nconvictions. \u201c[T]he moral convictions of thoughtful and\nwell-educated people are the data of ethics, just as sense-perceptions\nare the data of natural science\u201d (1930/2002, 41). Convictions\nare, however, a certain type of belief rather than an intellectual\napprehension, or seeming. So it looks like we can find two notions of\nintuition in intuitionist thought\u2014one understood as an\nintellectual seeming or apprehension, and the other as a\n pre-theoretical, non-inferred, firmly held belief or\n conviction.[2]\n Which one they opt for makes a difference to their epistemology.\n\n\nLike other epistemic foundationalists, Price insists that all\nreasoning and knowledge must ultimately rest on propositions that are\nnot inferred from other premises. For ethical intuitions this\n non-inferred basis of knowledge is self-evident truth grasped by\n intuition.[3]\n It is, however, important to keep intuition and self-evidence separate\nfor a number of reasons. First, a conscious intuition is a certain\nmental state, either a non-inferential belief or an intellectual\nseeming. But a self-evident proposition is not a conscious mental\nstate. Second, intuition is a way in which we are aware of\nself-evident propositions, whereas self-evident propositions are the\nthings that can be known in this way. Such propositions could (pace\nPrice) be believed without an intuition of them. As I will explain\nlater, one might have some argument that leads one to believe a\nself-evident proposition, or one may believe it on the basis of\nauthoritative testimony. Thirdly, it may turn out that things other\nthan self-evident propositions can be grasped by intuition. For\ninstance, we may have moral intuitions about concrete cases, such as\nvarious trolley cases (see below) and various anti-consequentialist\ncounter-examples. But it is not obvious that the contents of these\nintuitions are self-evident propositions; whether they are may depend\non how self-evidence is understood.\n\n\nPrice claims that self-evident truths are \u201cincapable of\n proof\u201d (1758/1969,\n 160).[4]\n Most classical intuitionists endorse this view,\nalthough Ross is arguably an exception. This is easily missed, for he\nstates at one point that self-evident moral propositions \n\u201ccannot be proved, but \u2026 just as certainly need no proof\u201d \n(1930/2002, 30). But elsewhere in The Right and the Good he \nmakes only the more restricted claim that such propositions do not\n need any\n proof,[5]\n and\ndespite the fact that he sometimes makes the further claim that they\ncannot receive any proof by means of argument, this further\n claim does not seem to reflect his considered\n view.[6]\n Evidence that it does not can be found in an\narticle written three years before the publication of The Right and\nthe Good where he explicitly states that  \u201cthe fact that\nsomething can be inferred does not prove that it cannot be seen\nintuitively\u201d (1927, 121). If he thinks that some proposition can\nbe inferred from (justified by) other propositions and be self-evident,\nhe clearly thinks that its being self-evident does not rule out the\npossibility of a proof. In any case there is nothing in the notion of a\nself-evident proposition that rules out justification or argument for\nthat proposition. A self-evident proposition is one that we can be\njustified in believing without an argument, but this does not rule out\nthe possibility that there may be such an argument, or justification,\n or that the proposition may be believed on that\n basis.[7]\n Since such arguments are not needed for us to be justified in\nbelieving a self-evident proposition, they are what may be called\n\u2019epistemically supererogatory\u2019.\n\n\nAlthough there can be an argument for a self-evident or an intuitive proposition, if\nintuitions are understood as intellectual seemings, then intuitions\ncannot be justified. This is easily missed, as we tend to identify\nintuitions with the beliefs based on them, rather than with the\nintellectual seemings on which those beliefs are based. But if we take\nan intuition to be an intellectual seeming, then intuitions cannot be\njustified any more than a perceptual seeming can. Take a perceptual\nseeming, such as it\u2019s seeming that the wall is green. This\nperceptual seeming could be explained in various ways, but it\nis odd to suppose that this experience could be justified by anything\n(which is not to rule out the possibility that the belief based on it\ncould be justified). This is because we are in a certain sense passive\nin relation to such seemings. Similarly, if some proposition presents\nitself to the mind as true, then this presentation cannot be justified,\nalthough the belief based on it can be (and we might add, the\nproposition intuited can be), for its seeming to be true is not a\nconclusion we could arrive at: it\u2019s just how certain propositions\npresent themselves to the mind.\n\n\nIt may be that the reason that Ross switches between making the\nstronger claim that self-evident propositions cannot be\njustified, and the weaker claim that they need no justification, is\nthat he had in mind a belief in some self-evident proposition when he\nsaid they could be justified, and our intuition (apprehension) of that\nproposition when he said that they could not.\n1.2 Self-evidence\n\n\nThe notion of a self-evident proposition is a term of art in\nintuitionist thought, and needs to be distinguished from certain\ncommon sense understandings with which it may easily be conflated. The\nfirst thing to note is that a self-evident proposition is not the same\nas an obvious truth. To begin with, obviousness is relative to certain\nindividuals or groups. What is obvious to you may not be obvious to\nme.  But self-evidence is not relative in this way. Although a\nproposition may be evident to one person but not to another, it could\nnot be self-evident to one person, but not to another. A proposition\nis just self-evident, not self-evident to someone. Secondly,\nthere are many obvious truths that are not self-evident. Certain\nwell-known empirical truths, for example, that if I drop a heavy\nobject it will fall, or that the world is bigger than a football, are\nobvious but not self-evident. There are also self-evident propositions\nthat may not be obvious to everyone, at least prior to reflection,\ne.g., that if all As are Bs and no Bs are Cs then no Cs are\nAs, or that one man can be the father and grandfather of the same child. \n \n\nWhat then is it for a proposition to be self-evident? Locke says that\na self-evident proposition is one that \u201ccarries its own light\nand evidence with it, and needs no other proof: he that understands\nthe terms, assents to it for its own sake\u201d (1969, 139). Price\ntells us that a self-evident proposition is immediate, and needs no\nfurther proof, and goes on to say that self-evident propositions need\nonly be understood to gain assent 1758/1969, 187). Ross writes, a\nself-evident proposition is \u201cevident without any need of proof,\nor of evidence beyond itself\u201d (1930/2002, 29), and Broad\ndescribes self-evident propositions as being \u201csuch that a\nrational being of sufficient insight and intelligence could see it to\nbe true by merely inspecting it and reflecting on its terms and their\nmode of combination\u201d (1936, 102\u20133). These passages may\nhave led to the standard understanding of a self-evident proposition\nthat one finds in Shafer-Landau (2003, 247) and Audi (2001, 603; see\nalso Audi 2008, 478). Audi, for instance, writes that self evident\npropositions are \u201ctruths such that (a) adequately understanding\nthem is sufficient justification for believing them \u2026, and (b)\nbelieving them on the basis of adequately understanding them entails\nknowing them\u201d (2008, 478).\n\n\nOne should distinguish knowing a self-evident proposition from knowing\nthat that proposition is self-evident. The former does not imply the\nlatter. Someone might know some self-evident proposition, such as that\nif A is better than B and B is better than C then\nA is better than C, but lack the concept of self-evidence, so\ncouldn\u2019t know that that proposition is self-evident. One might even\nknow a self-evident proposition whilst endorsing a theory according to\nwhich no propositions are self-evident.\n\n\nBut given that a proposition may seem to be self-evident when it is not,\nit is useful to have a way of discriminating the merely apparent from\nthe real ones. Sidgwick\u2019s criteria may be regarded as helping us do\nthis. According to Sidgwick, to be sure that a proposition is self-evident it must:\n\nbe clear and distinct\nbe ascertained by careful reflection\nbe consistent with other self-evident truths\nattract general consensus (1874/1967, 338)\n\n\n\nIf some apparent self-evident proposition does not have all of these\nfeatures then we should reduce our confidence that it is a genuine\nself-evident proposition. It is, however, a striking feature of Sidgwick\u2019s own\nprinciples that they do not pass this test. But whether we can come to\nknow that some proposition is self-evident in this, or some other way,\nthe point is that we do not need to know that some proposition is\nself-evident to know that it is true.\n\n\nAccording to the standard account, a self-evident proposition is one\nwhich an adequate understanding of the proposition justifies us in\nbelieving it. But all that Locke and Price say is that we need an\nunderstanding of a self-evident proposition in order to believe it,\nand presumably to be justified in believing it. They do not say that\nour understanding provides that justification, or that when we believe\nit, we believe it on the basis of our understanding. Indeed the idea\nthat it is our understanding of a self-evident proposition that\njustifies us in believing it may sound odd to many people. Certainly\nif one assumes that if p justifies belief in q, then p is\na reason to believe q, it is hard to see how our understanding\njustifies us in believing the proposition understood, for no one can\nclaim that their understanding of a proposition gives them a reason to\nbelieve it. One explanation of this is that the sort of thing that can\nprovide reasons to believe that p are either evidence that p\nor, more controversially, pragmatic considerations, such as that\nbelieving that p will have certain good consequences. An adequate\nunderstanding of a proposition is neither of these things. The fact\nthat I understand some proposition is not something that would make\nbelieving that proposition have any good consequences, and my\nunderstanding is not evidence for the truth of the proposition\nunderstood. Evidence is standardly understood as something that makes\nthe proposition it is evidence for more probable. But an adequate\nunderstanding of a proposition does not make that proposition more\nprobable, so is not evidence for it. Since an understanding of a\nproposition is neither a pragmatic nor an evidential consideration, it\nseems it is not the right sort of thing to give us a reason to believe\nthat proposition, and so not the right sort of thing to justify that\nbelief. Robert Audi has, however, recently offered an account of\nadequate understanding that attempts to deal with this kind of\nobjection. He does not claim that adequate understanding of a\nproposition is evidence for that proposition, but claims that adequate\nunderstanding puts us in touch with the truth-makers of the\nself-evident proposition, and it is this that makes it the right sort\nof thing to justify belief (Audi, 2019, 379\u2013380) \n\n\nBut the oddity of supposing that it is our understanding that\njustifies us in believing a self-evident proposition does not rest on\nthe assumption that justification is to be defined as reason to\nbelieve, or that what gives us reason to believe that p is\nevidence for the truth of p or some benefit of believing this. If you\nask someone why they believe some apparently self-evident proposition,\nsuch as that agony is bad, it would be very surprising if they replied\nby saying \u201cI believe it because I understand it\u201d.\n\n\nGiven these worries about whether our understanding can justify us in\nbelieving the proposition understood, we should ask whether there is\nanything else that might justify us in believing a self-evident\nproposition. If intuitions are beliefs, then our intuition that p\ncannot justify us in believing p. The same is true if intuitions are\ninclinations to believe, as Williamson (2000), Sosa (2007) and Earlenbaugh and Molyneux, 2009) claim, for the fact that I am\ninclined to believe some proposition is no justification for believing\nit. But if intuitions are intellectual seemings, then they may be able\nto justify the beliefs based on them. For with this understanding of\nan intuition we can say that what justifies our belief in a\nself-evident proposition is that it seems true, just as we might say\nthat what justifies us in having some experiential belief is that\nperceptually, the world seems to be that way. Why do you believe the\nwall is green? Because it seems green. Why do you think that agony is\nbad? Because it seems bad.\n\n\nIf intuitions rather than our understanding of their content justify\nus in believing that content, then intuitionists should understand a\nself-evident proposition as follows:\n\n\nA self-evident proposition is one of which a clear intuition is\nsufficient justification for believing it, and for believing it on the\nbasis of that intuition (see Stratton-Lake, 2016, 38).\n\n\nAn adequate understanding is necessary for one to be justified in this\nway, but this is not because understanding provides justification;\nrather, it is because it is needed to get the proposition clearly in\nview, and so enables a clear intuition of it. But it is the intuition\nthat justifies, not the understanding.\n\n\nWhether this account helps intuitionists will depend on a more general\nmetaphilosophical debate about the role of intuitions in philosophy,\nand whether intuitions justify. There is a difference, though. The\nmore general debate is about whether intuitions provide evidence for\nbelieving or rejecting certain theories, whereas the intuitionist\nneeds intuitions to justify beliefs with the same content. Secondly,\nthere might be reason to think that although intuitions can provide\njustification in other areas of philosophy, they cannot do that in\nmorality. For instance, one might think that people\u2019s moral\nintuitions vary too much to be reliable indicators of truth, or that\nin morality emotions can distort our intuitions (see\nSinnott-Armstrong, 2006), or that we only have the moral intuitions we\ndo because having those beliefs has survival value (Street, 2006).\n Some recent intuitionists have shied away from the view that\ncertain moral propositions are self-evident and have, instead, argued\nthat all the intuitionist needs is the claim that intuitions,\nunderstood as intellectual seemings, provide non-inferential\njustification for some of our moral beliefs (Huemer 2005, 106 and\nBedke 2008\u2014though Bedke rejects intuitionism). As these authors\nview things, claiming that some at least of the propositions intuited\nare self-evident does not gain intuitionists anything.\n1.3 Disagreement\n\n\nMany philosophers think that pervasive moral disagreement casts doubt\non the intuitionists\u2019 claim that certain moral propositions are\nself-evident. If there were certain moral propositions that can be\nknown if adequately understood, then, it is argued, people with an\nadequate understanding of them would believe them, and there would be\nuniversal assent amongst mature, comprehending people. But there is no\nsuch universal assent. So there are no self-evident moral\npropositions.\n\n\nSidgwick took disagreement seriously, and thought that if there was\nsignificant disagreement about the truth of some apparently\nself-evident moral proposition, then that casts doubt on whether that\nproposition really is self-evident. Intuitionists could defend\nthemselves from this objection by downplaying the amount of moral\ndisagreement. They might claim that a lot of moral disagreement stems\nfrom disagreement about non-moral facts, such as what the consequences\nof a certain act will be. For instance, two people might disagree\nabout whether it is permissible to boil lobsters alive just because\nthey disagree about whether lobsters can feel pain. Since the basis of\ntheir moral disagreement is this disagreement about the relevant\nneurological fact, if they agreed on this non-moral fact, we could\nexpect them to agree about the permissibility of boiling lobsters\nalive.\n\n\nFurthermore, although people might disagree about the permissibility\nof boiling lobsters alive, we may assume that they agree that pain is\na bad thing, and the infliction of undeserved pain is prima facie\nwrong. If this assumption is correct, then the disputants agree about\nthe moral facts here. They disagree only about the empirical,\nnon-moral facts.\n \n\nAnother factor that might explain moral disagreement is\ndisagreement about the strength of certain moral reasons. Many\ndisputants might agree about the non-moral facts, and about what is\nmorally relevant, but disagree about the weight that should be given\nto the different moral considerations. So, for example, two people\nmight disagree about whether they ought to push a large man onto the\nrail tracks to derail a trolley that would otherwise kill five people,\nbut this is quite consistent with them agreeing that the fact that\nthis act would save five people counts in favour of pushing the man\noff the bridge, and that the fact that he would die if this were done\ncounts against doing it. In such a case there is agreement about what\nis relevant, and how it is relevant, but disagreement about the weight\nof the competing moral considerations\u2014one person regards the\nevil of killing one person as weightier than the good of saving five,\nwhile the other regards the evil of killing one as outweighed by the\ngood of saving the five. There is still moral disagreement here, but\nit is simply a difference in judgement about the application of agreed\nmoral principles.\n\n\nThis fits with the intuitionist view held, e.g., by Ross, that causing\ngood outcomes is prima facie right, and that causing harm is prima\nfacie wrong, for Ross held that both of these propositions are\nself-evident. He denied, however, that the stringency, or weight, of\nthese different prima facie duties is self-evident (1939, 188). About\nthis, he maintained, we could only have a probable opinion.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that moral disagreement does not imply that people\nhave different intuitions. Ross, for example, had the strong intuition\nthat it is permissible to miss an opportunity to enjoy some innocent\npleasure, but at the time he wrote The Right and the Good he\ndid not believe this. (Later, in the Foundations of Ethics, he\nchanged his mind.) He believed it would be wrong to pass up such an\nopportunity because pleasure is good, and we ought to maximise the\ngood. So although he would disagree with someone who believed that it\nis permissible to pass up an opportunity to enjoy some innocent\npleasure, he would share their intuition that this is permissible.\nSimilarly, it is plausible to suppose that many act consequentialists\nstill have the intuition that it is wrong to harvest organs from a\nhealthy but non-consenting donor to save five other lives. But because\nthey have persuaded themselves of the truth of act consequentialism,\nthey would not believe this act is wrong.\n \n\nOne of the theoretical advantages of thinking of intuitions as\nintellectual seemings is that we can allow for this mismatch between\nour intuitions and our beliefs. Just as something can seem\nperceptually to be a certain way while we don\u2019t believe it is that\nway, as in M\u00fcller-Lyer cases, so a proposition can seem\nintellectually to be true even though we do not believe it. Since such\nseemings are not beliefs, this does not commit intuitionists to the\nview that a conflict between our intuitions and beliefs entails contradictory beliefs.\n\n\nIntuitionists like Ross could still allow that their non-believed\nintuitions provide pro-tanto justification for believing them. It\u2019s\njust that this justification is outweighed by opposing intuitions, and\nthe theory based on them. A consequentialist with non-consequentialist\nintuitions could think the same. She may regard her deontological\nintuitions as giving her some justification for believing that it\nwould be wrong to harvest the organs to save five, but presumably\nwould regard the appeal of the consequentialist theory as a whole as\noutweighing this justification. She may even regard her deontological\nintuition as providing sufficient reason to believe that such acts are\nwrong, even though she thinks that on balance she has more reason to\nbelieve that such acts are permissible.\n\n\nFinally, Ethical Intuitionists allow that various other factors can\nlead to disagreement. Clarke, for instance, allowed that stupidity,\ncorruption, or perverseness may make one doubt self-evident\npropositions (1706/1969, 194). John Balguy also acknowledges that\nself-evident moral principles, like many other plain and evident\ntruths, may be, and have been, doubted, \u201ceven by philosophers\nand men of letters\u201d whom, presumably, he did not regard as\nstupid or corrupt (1728/1969, 406). And Price maintained that all\nforms of knowledge, including intuitive knowledge, may be evident in\ndifferent degrees (1758/1969, 160). Intuition may be clear and\nperfect, but may sometimes be faint and obscure. Such variance in\ndegrees of clarity allows that a self-evident proposition may be\nimperfectly and obscurely grasped, and this may lead someone to deny\nits truth. Similarly, Moore claimed that \u201cevery way in which it\nis possible to cognise a true proposition, it is also possible to\ngrasp a false one\u201d (1903/1993, 36), and Ross notes that\nself-evident propositions may only be evident to us once we reach a\ncertain moral maturity (1930/2002, 29). Given all these ways in\nwhich the truth of a self-evident proposition may be missed, it is no\n surprise that there is no universal\n assent.[8]\n But the absence of\nuniversal assent is quite consistent with self-evidence, as long as\n one does not regard \u2018self-evidence\u2019 to mean, or imply,\n obviousness.[9]\n\n\nBut despite what has been said above, critics of intuitionism can\nclaim that the fact that there is disagreement between moral\nphilosophers and even between intuitionists themselves undermines the view\nthat certain propositions are self-evident. These philosophers will\nhave thought long and hard about the relevant propositions, and (we\nwould hope) have a very clear understanding of them. One would,\ntherefore, expect that if there were certain moral propositions the\ntruth of which could be apprehended by intuition, then moral\nphilosophers would converge on these truths.  Persistent disagreement\namongst reflective, thoughtful, and comprehending moral philosophers\nmay cast doubt on the view that any of these propositions are\nself-evident.\n\n\nFurthermore, if intuitions are intellectual seemings, one might ask\nwhy certain moral propositions seem true whereas others do not. If\nmoral facts are non-natural facts, as intuitionists maintain, and\nnon-natural properties lack causal powers, then moral intuitions\ncannot be caused by the corresponding moral facts, as, e.g., certain\nperceptual seemings are caused by certain natural facts. Critics would\nargue that certain things seem right and good to us, not because of\nsome inherent value they have, but because we have evolved to react to\ncertain types of act with approval or disapproval (Singer 2005; Street\n2006; and Joyce 2007, ch. 6).\n\n\nWe have evolved to feel instant approval of acts that benefit our\ngroup, such as those that exemplify reciprocal trust, and honesty, and\nthus enhance our chances of survival, and to feel disapproval of acts\nsuch as deceit, and betrayal, that undermine trust and the benefits\nthat brings. Intuitionists need to find some way of responding to this\nsort of objection without abandoning their non-naturalism.\n1.4 Trolley cases and the reliability of moral intuitions\n\n\nEmpirical psychology has recently cast doubt on the reliability of at\nleast some of our moral intuitions. Since a self-evident proposition\nis one of which a clear intuition justifies us in believing it, these\ndoubts call into question the claim that our moral intuitions justify\nus in believing them, and thus whether there are any self-evident\nmoral propositions. The experiments that cast doubt on our intuitions\ntend to focus on our intuitions about trolley cases. Consider the\nfollowing three cases:\n\nSwitch: there are five people on the rail track,\nand an out of control trolley that will kill all five of them. There is\na lever that would divert the trolley onto a different track. But there\nis a single person on that track who would be killed if you pull the\nlever and divert the trolley.\n\nBridge: there are five people on the rail track,\nand an out of control trolley that will kill all five of them. There is\na large man standing on the bridge over the track. If you pushed him\noff the bridge onto the track, he would be killed. But he would derail\nthe trolley and so the five people on the track would be saved.\n\nTrap door: there are five people on the rail track,\nand an out of control trolley that will kill all five of them. There is\na man standing on the bridge over the track. If he fell onto the track\nhe would be killed, but would derail the trolley thus saving the five\npeople on the track. He is standing on a trap door that would open and\ndrop him onto the track if you pulled a lever.\n\n\nPeople tend to say that they should pull the lever in Switch, but\nthat they ought not to push the man off the bridge in Bridge. Bridge\nlooks similar to Switch in that you would be killing one person to save\nfive. So why the different intuitions? One could try to explain away\nthese apparently conflicting intuitions with the doctrine of double\neffect. According to this doctrine, we may produce some good that\ninvolves a bad outcome, so long as the bad outcome is not intended. If the\nbad outcome is a means to the good end, then it is intended (as a\nmeans), and is not merely foreseen. So such acts are wrong according to\nthe doctrine of double effect.\n\n\nSwitch seems to be a case where the bad outcome is foreseen, but not\nintended. Bridge seems to be a case where the bad outcome is intended\nas a means of saving the five. So one way to explain the different\nintuitions in Switch and Bridge is with reference to the doctrine of\ndouble effect. But this explanation is unsettled by a variant of\nSwitch, according to which the large man is on the spur track, and that\ntrack now loops back onto the main one. Here it looks like by pulling\nthe lever we would be using the large man merely as a means to saving\nthe five, for unless he stops the trolley it will loop round and kill\nthe five from the other direction. But it still seems permissible to\npull the lever, yet wrong to push the man off the bridge.\n\n\nFurthermore, this explanation of people\u2019s different intuitions is\ncalled into question by Trap Door. For Trap Door is like Bridge in the\nsense that the bystander is killed as a means of saving the five, but\nmany more people tend to have the intuition that it is permissible to\npull the lever in Trap Door (Greene et al. 2009).\n The difference in people\u2019s intuitions between Bridge and Trap Door\ncasts serious doubt on the deontologist\u2019s explanation of the\ndifference in their intuitions about Switch and Bridge. An alternative\nexplanation of the difference is that the Bridge case is \u2018up\nclose and personal\u2019 in the sense that it involves physical\ncontact, whereas in Switch and Trap Door the agent is remote from the\nperson they have to kill to save the five (Singer, 2005). But this\ndifference is morally irrelevant, so if this explanation is right,\nthen our intuitions are distorted by at least one morally irrelevant\nfactor.\n\n\nAlso it seems that our intuitions are subject to framing effects. For\ninstance, our intuitions seem to be affected by whether we word our\nscenario in terms of killing or saving, and by the order in which the\ntrolley examples are considered. If people are asked to consider\nSwitch first, and Bridge second, they tend to say that it is\npermissible to pull the lever in Switch but not permissible to push\nthe man onto the track in Bridge. If, however, they are given the\nBridge case first a higher percentage say that it would be wrong to pull the\nlever in Switch. So it looks like the order in which the cases are\ngiven affects people\u2019s intuitions about the cases. But the order in\nwhich one considers the cases is morally irrelevant. So it looks like\n our intuitions can be distorted by a second\n source.[10]\n \n\nOne thing worthy of note is that these cases test intuitions about\nour overall moral judgements\u2014that is, about what we should, or\nmay do in certain circumstances. But not all intuitionists claim that\nprinciples about what we ought to do are self-evident. W. D. Ross for\nexample claimed that only principles of prima facie duty are\nself-evident, and principles of prima facie duty are, roughly,\nprinciples stating that certain facts count in favour of an act and\nothers count against. So these principles state, for instance, that \nthe fact that one\u2019s act would produce some good, or the fact that it \nwould be the keeping of a promise, or the expression\nof gratitude, etc., counts in favour of it, and the fact that, for\nexample, it would involve the infliction of harm on someone counts\nagainst it. What we ought to do is determined by all of these facts,\nand how they weigh up against each other. Ross denied that we can ever\nknow what we ought to do, and rejected the view that there could be\nstrictly universal, self-evident principles specifying what we ought\nto do.\n \n\nIt would be interesting to hear the outcome of experiments to see\nwhether people\u2019s intuitions about prima facie duty are subject\nto change on morally irrelevant grounds. This is something that\nrequires empirical testing, but it is hard to imagine someone thinking\nthat the fact that one would have to kill an innocent person in order\nto save five didn\u2019t count against doing this act, or that the\nfact that their act would save five innocent people didn\u2019t count\nin favour of it, regardless of their overall verdict about whether\nthey should kill the one or let the five die. That their act involved\nphysically pushing someone in front of the trolley, or pulling a lever\nthat would release a trap door dropping them onto the track would\nplausibly make no difference to such intuitions. Nor would framing\neffects introduced by the order of presentation of the cases. If such\na priori expectations are correct then empirical psychology would\nraise no problems for a Rossian intuitionism that claims only that\nprinciples of prima facie duty are self-evident.\n \n\nJames Andow (2018) has put these claims to the test, and it turns out\nthat a significant number of people (25%) do not accept that the fact\nthat someone would be killed by either pulling the lever or pushing\nthem off a bridge to save five counts against doing this, whether they\nare imagining themselves doing the act or commenting on someone\nelse\u2019s action (121). He also discovered that people\u2019s\nintuitions did change between the lever case and the bridge case in\nrelation to whether the fact that five lives would be saved counts in\nfavour of doing the act (121). So it seems that intuitions about\nwhether saving lives counts in favour of acting is vulnerable to\nframing effects. \n\n\nAndow argues that we shouldn\u2019t dismiss these results on the\ngrounds that the responses did not reflect the participants\u2019\nintuitions about the moral relevance of killing (138ff). But it is\nhard to accept that 25% of respondents really thought that the fact\nthat their act involves killing someone does not even count against\ndoing it. To believe this is not just to sincerely utter the words,\nbut involves certain counter-factual beliefs. For instance, if I did\nnot think that the fact that by pulling the lever I would be killing\nsomeone counts against pulling the lever, then if I had a second lever\nwhich would save the five without killing anyone, I would be\nindifferent about which lever I\u2019d pull. It is difficult to\nbelieve that the respondents who claimed that killing did not matter\nin trolley case scenarios would be indifferent in this counter-factual\nscenario. Furthermore, thinking that killing does not count against\none\u2019s act commits one to the thought that there is absolutely\nnothing to regret. But it is likely that if these people were put in a\nreal scenario where they could only save five by killing one, they\nwould regret deeply the fact that they could only save the five in\nthis way. None of this fits with the results of Andow\u2019s\nexperimental findings, and casts doubt on whether the\nrespondent\u2019s replies really reflect their intuitions about the\ncase. \n\n\nBut even if Ross-style intuitions were not vulnerable to such\ndisagreement and framing effects, critics may object that in so far as\nRoss\u2019s theory does not tell us what we ought to do, it does not\ngive us what we want from a moral theory. Being told that various\nfeatures count for or against certain actions, and that one just has\nto decide for oneself in each case what one should do, may be a very\ndisappointing result even if it is self-evident which features count\nfor or against.\n\n\nA further point about the findings of such experiments is whether the\nsubjects\u2019 answers to the experimenters\u2019 questions express\ntheir intuitions (Bengson 2013). When subjects have considered Bridge\nfirst, they are more likely to say that it would be wrong to pull the\nlever in Switch. This is taken to show that their intuitions are\nvulnerable to framing effects. But once we remember that one\u2019s\nbeliefs and judgements may conflict with one\u2019s intuitions it is\nnot at all clear that the subjects lack the intuition that it would be\npermissible to pull the lever in the switch case when they say that it\nwould be wrong. A perfectly plausible alternative is that they have\nreasoned that, because it would be wrong to kill someone to save five\nin Bridge, it must be wrong to kill someone to save five in Switch.\nThat is quite consistent with their having the intuition that it would\nbe permissible to pull the lever in the switch case, since intuiting\nis not believing. This point does not however explain James\nAndow\u2019s findings.\n1.5 Non-inferential justification?\n\n\nSinnott-Armstrong claims that results from empirical psychology\nshow that most of our moral beliefs are false, because they have been\nformed by an unreliable process (2006, 353). The unreliable process is\nbasing them on intuitions that are systematically distorted by morally\nirrelevant factors, such as order or wording. Sinnott-Armstrong\ndoesn\u2019t deny that some moral intuitions can justify moral\nbeliefs. But given that the default justification provided by so many\nof them is undermined by distorting factors, we need to check that some\nmoral intuition is not one of the undermined ones before we can take it\nto provide justification. But then, he argues, the intuitions that do\nprovide justification do so only inferentially. Since moral intuitions\neither don\u2019t provide justification at all, or do so only\ninferentially, there is no non-inferential justification for our moral\nbeliefs and intuitionism is false.\n\n\nNathan Ballantyne and Joshua C. Thurow (2013) maintain that this\nargument does not work. They outline their point in terms of\nundercutting defeaters and defeaters of those defeaters. The distorting\nfactors that Sinnott-Armstrong mentions are the undercutting defeaters\nof the justification of most of our moral beliefs. If we have evidence\nthat a subclass of our moral beliefs is not subject to these\nundercutting defeaters, then that evidence defeats the defeater, and\njustification is restored.\n\n\nWith this jargon in hand they argue that Sinnott-Armstrong\u2019s argument\nconflates the belief\u2019s justification being supported by an\ninference with the belief itself being supported by an\ninference. Let U signify the undercutting defeaters for a moral\nbelief, D the evidence that defeats these defeaters, and B the\nmoral belief. Sinnott-Armstrong argues that for D to defeat U and\nthus restore the justification for B, D must provide the agent\nwith a reason to believe that B was formed reliably. But,\nBallantyne and Thurow maintain, D can defeat U independently of\nthe agent\u2019s ability to provide arguments for his belief. My belief is\njustified only on the basis of the following argument:\n\nD, \nD defeats U, \n therefore, U is defeated.\n\n\n\nSo this inference supports B\u2019s justification. But B itself is\nnot supported by that inference. B is, they claim, supported by the\nrelevant intuition alone. (414). Being able to argue that the original,\nnon-inferential justification for B has not been undermined, does not\nentail being able to argue for B. All this argument does is restore the\noriginal non-inferential justification for the belief.\n\n\nBallantyne and Thurow illustrate this point with the following\nnon-moral example.\n \n\nMcCoy visits the local widget factory and sees what seems to be a\nred widget being carried along a conveyor belt. He believes that the\nwidget is red\u2026. Soon enough, a stranger approaches McCoy and\nsays that the widgets are actually white but are illuminated by red\nlights\u2026 Upon seeing this conversation, another\nstranger\u2014who seems to McCoy to be a factory employee\u2014tells\nMcCoy not to listen to the other stranger: he is a trickster, McCoy is\ntold, who likes to mess around with visitors. (2013, 413)\n\n\nSinnott-Armstrong would say that in order for the undercutting\ndefeater (the 1st stranger\u2019s comment) to be defeated by the\nfactory worker\u2019s claim that the stranger is a trickster, the factory\nworker\u2019s comment must provide McCoy with a reason to think that his\nbelief was formed reliably. But, Ballantyne and Thurow claim, all that\nhas happened is that the original, non-inferential justification has\nbeen restored. \u201cWhatever initially made B justified continues\nto justify B once the defeater has been defeated.  McCoy\u2019s belief\nthat the widget is red is justified by his perceptual experience or\nseeming\u201d (414). The same can be said of moral intuitions. I may\nregard my moral belief as justified by an intuition with the same\ncontent if I am justified in believing that potential undercutting\ndefeaters have been defeated (or are absent). In such a case I have an\ninferential argument for the justification of my moral belief, but\nthat does not mean that I have an inferential justification for my\nmoral belief. All that has happened, is that the original,\nnon-inferential justification (provided by the intuition) has been\nrestored.\n\n\nNonetheless, Ballantyne and Thurow do not question the first part of\nSinnott- Armstrong\u2019s argument\u2014that is, the claim that\nbecause of partiality, bias, emotion and disagreement, we have good\nreason to think that most of our moral beliefs are false. If it is\ntrue, as Sinnott-Armstrong claims, that most of our moral beliefs are\nfalse, then intuitionists\u2019 trust in our ordinary moral thought\nwill look undermined regardless of whether they can salvage a few sound\nmoral beliefs from the wreckage. So intuitionists would not only have\nto argue that some intuitions justify non-inferentially, but that there\nis a significantly large group of reliable intuitions to validate their\nmethodology, and Ballantyne and Thurow\u2019s argument does not help\nwith that.\n2. Intuitionist metaphysics\n2.1 Indefinable, non-natural properties\n\n\nAlong with its moral epistemology, a distinctive feature of\nintuitionist thought is its non-naturalist realism. Intuitionists\nmaintain that moral judgements are cognitive states, and that some at\nleast of these judgements are true. They are true when the things\nreferred to have the moral property that is ascribed to them by the\njudgement. The moral properties that intuitionists tended to focus on were\nthe thin moral properties of goodness and rightness. These properties\nare, they maintained, simple, non-natural properties. It is not always\nclear how they understood the notion of a non-natural property (more on\nthis below), but for now we can say that they denied that moral\nproperties can be defined wholly in terms of psychological,\nsociological, or biological properties. Some intuitionists allowed that\ngoodness can be defined in terms of rightness (Sidgwick and Ewing) or\nrightness in terms of goodness (early Moore). But all intuitionists\nmaintained that at least one of these moral properties is simple, or\nindefinable.\n\n\nAlthough their view is about the nature of moral properties, they\noften put their point in terms of moral concepts or ideas, and\nmaintained that these concepts are either unanalysable, or if\nanalysable, not analysable wholly in terms of natural concepts. It\nseems they assumed that if a concept was indefinable then its\ncorresponding property would be indefinable, and vice versa. Many\nphilosophers today would deny this assumption.\n\n\nThe simplicity of moral properties, such as rightness and goodness,\nand our ideas of them, was important for early intuitionists such as\nPrice, as he accepted the empiricist doctrine that simple ideas cannot\nbe invented but must be acquired by immediate intuition, as all simple\nideas must \u201cbe ascribed to some power of immediate\nperception in the human mind\u201d 1758/1969, 141), i.e., either\nsensibility or the\n understanding.[11]\n Consequently, the ideas of right and\nwrong must be immediate perceptions of either sensibility or the\n understanding.[12]\n\n\n\nIf right and wrong are just feelings of approval or disapproval caused\nin us by natural properties or objects, then the idea of right and\nwrong will be given by our senses, for these ideas will be merely the\neffect that the perception of certain things has on sensibility. If,\nhowever, right and wrong were real properties of actions, then they\ncould not be apprehended by any empirical sense, for we have no such\nsensation of right and wrong when we apprehend right or wrong actions.\nRather, what we see is that these actions are right, or\n wrong.[13]\nThis seeing still counts as\nintuition, as it is an immediate apprehension, but it is intellectual\nrather than sensible\n intuition.[14]\n\n\nIt is scarcely conceivable that anyone can impartially attend to the\nnature of his own perceptions, and determine that, when he thinks\ngratitude and beneficence to be right, he perceives nothing\ntrue of them, and understands nothing, but only\nreceives an impression from sense. (Price, 1758/1969,\n144\u20135)\n\n\n\nPrice concedes that certain feelings may attend our apprehension of\nright and wrong, but these impressions are merely the consequence of\nour perception of right and wrong. They are not what is perceived. For\nPrice I approve of some act because I see that it is right or good.\n\n\nBut even if Price is right that the ideas of right and wrong are\nsimple, and are grasped by the understanding, that does not imply that\nthey are non-natural.  For he allows that there are simple ideas of\nnatural properties, and that some of these, such as causality and\nequality, are grasped by the understanding rather than sensibility. So\na separate argument is needed for the non-natural nature of moral\nproperties.\n\n\nMoore is the intuitionist who laid most stress on the non-natural\nnature of moral properties, though his focus was on goodness rather\nthan rightness. In Principia Ethica Moore defines a natural\nproperty as one that can exist by itself in time and not merely as a\nproperty of some natural object (1903/1993a, 93). The idea is, then,\nthat natural properties, such as the pleasantness or squareness of an\nobject, can exist independently of that object, whereas the goodness\nof a good thing cannot exist independently of that thing.\n \n\nThis definition can be understood in terms of particular instances\nof some property or in terms of the universal\u2014the property\nitself.  Either way it does not distinguish natural from non-natural\nproperties as Moore thought. It does not seem that the particular\ninstance of redness in some particular red object could exist apart\nfrom that object any more than the particular instance of goodness of\nsome good thing could. A particular instance of any property is a way\nthat something is, and the way that some particular thing is cannot be\nseparated from the particular thing that is that way.\n\n\nBut things are no better if we understand Moore\u2019s definition in\nterms of universals, for on a Platonist theory of properties the\nuniversal could exist independently of any particular instance of it.\nIf this is true, it will be true of any property. This does not,\ntherefore, pick out what distinguishes the natural from the\nnon-natural. So if we are talking of property instances then no\nproperties can be separated from the things that instantiate them, and\nif we are talking of property types (properties as universals), then,\nat least on some views, all of them can be separated.\n\n\nMoore himself later abandoned this definition of the distinction\nbetween natural and non-natural properties, and described his earlier\naccount of a natural property as \u201cutterly silly and\npreposterous\u201d (1942, 582). In the Preface to the second edition\nof Principia Moore offers an alternative definition that is\nsuggested in chapter two of Principia. According to this\ndefinition, a natural property is one \u201cwith which it is the\nbusiness of the natural sciences or of Psychology to deal\u201d (13).\nSince the term to be defined (\u2018natural\u2019) appears in the\ndefinition, this definition may not seem very informative. But we can\nreplace the term \u2018natural sciences\u2019 with \u2018empirical\nsciences\u2019 (understood to include psychology and sociology) to\nget a useful and workable epistemological definition of a natural\nproperty.  On this account, then, natural facts can be known by purely\nempirical means, whereas non-natural moral facts cannot be known in\nthis way.  Such facts involve an essentially a priori element.\n\n\nIntuitively the intuitionists seem right. Empirical investigation can\ntell us many things about the world, but it does not seem that it can\ntell whether certain acts are right or wrong, good or bad. This is not\nto say that our moral views are not revisable in the light of\nempirical findings.  For instance if science told us that a\nlobster\u2019s neurological system is sufficiently advanced for it to\nfeel pain, we\u2019d revise our view about the permissibility of\nboiling them alive. But all that science would have told us is that\nlobsters feel pain when boiled alive. Science does not inform us that\nboiling them alive is wrong.  That seems to be something that cannot\nbe known empirically.\n\n\nMoore\u2019s open question argument can be regarded as giving form to this\nintuition. If the moral property of being good, for instance, could be\ndefined in wholly psychological, biological, or sociological terms,\nthen moral truths would turn out to be either psychological,\nbiological or sociological truths, which could then be discovered by\nempirical research by the appropriate science. But, Moore argues, all\nsuch definitions must fail, for it is always an open question whether\nthe thing that has the relevant empirical property is good. Moore\u2019s\nargument can be captured as follows:\n\nIf some property F\ncould be defined in terms of some other property G, then the\nquestion \u201cis something which is G, F?\u201d would be\nclosed.\nFor any naturalistic\ndefinition of goodness, it would always be an open question whether\nsomething that has the relevant natural property is good.\nTherefore, goodness\ncannot be naturalistically defined.\n\n \n\nAn open question is one that is not closed, and a closed question\nis one the asking of which betrays a lack of understanding of the\nconcepts involved. For instance, if I asked \u201cJones is a widow,\nbut was she ever married?\u201d, this would show that I don\u2019t really\nunderstand the term \u201cwidow\u201d. So this question is closed.\nMoore claims that we can test any naturalistic definition of goodness\nby asking whether something that has those natural properties is good,\nand then seeing whether this question is open or closed. If the\ndefinition is true, then the question must be closed, so if it is\nopen, the definition must be false. \n\n\nSuppose, for instance, someone proposes that goodness can be defined\nin terms of causality and pleasure. To be good, they claim, is just to\ncause pleasure. Moore\u2019s view is that if this definition were\ncorrect, it would be a closed question whether something that causes\npleasure is good. For in effect one would be asking whether something\nthat causes pleasure causes pleasure, and that is clearly a closed\nquestion. But, Moore insists, the question \u201cis something\nthat causes pleasure good?\u201d is an open question. One could,\nwithout conceptual confusion, debate whether something that causes\npleasure is good. So goodness cannot be defined as causes pleasure.\n\n\nMoore assumes that this will be true of every putative naturalistic\ndefinition of goodness, whether it be in terms of second-order desires,\nsocial approval, being more evolved, or whatever. All of these\nnaturalistic definitions would fail the open question argument. If he\nis right, and goodness cannot be defined wholly with reference to\nconcepts from the empirical sciences, then goodness is a sui generis\nnotion, i.e., is one that can only be understood in its own, evaluative\nterms.\n\n\nMoore\u2019s argument has a great deal of intuitive force, but has\nbeen subject to various objections, and it is not clear that all of\nthem can be answered. One of the first was that it just begs the\nquestion against the naturalist. Moore only considers a few very crude\nnaturalistic definitions of goodness, and concludes from these that all\nnaturalistic definitions will fail the open question argument. Frankena\n(1939) objected that this was premature. We cannot know in advance that\nevery naturalistic definition will fail this test. We just have to wait\nand consider the proposals. To conclude from a few crude examples that\nall naturalistic definitions will fail is just bad induction.\n\n\nAnother objection is that the open question argument does not tell us\nanything distinctive about the concept of goodness, but is simply an\ninstance of the paradox of analysis. According to this paradox any true\nanalysis will be uninformative, because it will be reducible to a\ntautology, and any informative analysis will be false, because it\ncan\u2019t be reduced to a tautology. According to earlier versions of\nwhat Moore called \u2018the open question argument\u2019, and on one\ninterpretation of Moore\u2019s argument, the reason that good cannot\nbe analysed in naturalistic terms is that it turns what sounds like a\nsubstantive moral claim, e.g., that pleasure is good, into the empty\ntautology that pleasure is pleasure. But then this looks like a\nparticular instance of the paradox of analysis. To see this, consider\nthe following analysis of the concept \u2018mammal\u2019:\n\n(M)\nA mammal is a member of a species of which the \n                      females suckle their young.\n\n\n\nThis looks informative as it can tell us why whales and duck-billed\nplatypuses are mammals when they are so different in seemingly\nsignificant ways from other mammals. But if the analysis is true, and\n\u2018mammal\u2019 just means \u2018member of a species of which the\nfemales suckle their young\u2019, then (M) means:\n\n(T)\nA member of a species of which the females suckle their\nyoung is a member of a species of which the females suckle their\nyoung\n\n\n\n(T) is, however, just an uninformative tautology. This is a quite\ngeneral problem in the theory of analysis, so if it applies to\nseemingly informative analyses of goodness, then that would reveal\nnothing distinctive about naturalistic analyses of moral terms.\n\n\nFurthermore, some analyses are not obvious. The analysis of the concept\nof a mammal is an example of a non-obvious analysis. It is for that\nreason that the question \u201cA is a member of a species the female\nof which suckle their young, but is A a mammal?\u201d will seem open,\neven though it is a true analysis. Similarly, a non-obvious\nnaturalistic definition of good may fail the open question test even\nthough it is true.\n2.2 Analyses of concepts and property identity claims.\n\n\nA naturalist might accept that the open question argument works in\nrelation to moral concepts, but deny that we can make any inferences\n about the way the world is from the fact that we think of it in certain\n ways.[15]\n For the way in which\nwe think about the world is determined by our understanding of the\nconcepts we use to describe it, and we cannot reliably infer that the\nworld is a certain way from the fact that we conceive of it in that\nway. To think that one can make such inferences is to confuse\n predicates or concepts with\n properties,[16]\n analytical identities with synthetic identities.\nWe know what we mean by certain concepts by a priori reflection, but\nthe nature of the things to which these concepts refer can only be\ndiscovered by empirical investigation. We did not discover that water\nis H2O or that heat is mean kinetic molecular energy by a priori\nreflection on what we mean by \u2018water\u2019 and\n\u2018heat\u2019, but by empirical investigation. Furthermore, we\ncould not object to the view that heat is mean kinetic energy on the\nground that this is not what we mean when we think of something as hot.\nBut the intuitionists seem to object to naturalistic accounts of moral\nproperties in precisely this way.\n\n\nThere is, however, reason to think that intuitionists such as Moore and\nRoss did not confuse concepts and properties. For they were careful to\ndistinguish an elucidation of the meaning of words and an account of\nthe nature of the world with their distinction between proper verbal\ndefinitions and the sort of definitions they are interested in (viz.,\n metaphysical\n ones).[17]\n A proper verbal definition of \u2018good\u2019 is simply an account of\nhow most people use the word, whereas a metaphysical definition is one\nthat tells us the nature of the thing of which the concept is a\n concept.[18]\n This is not\nquite the distinction between an analysis of a concept and an account\nof the nature of a corresponding property, but it is close enough to\ngive us reason to suppose that intuitionists such as Moore and Ross\nwere aware of the distinction between concepts and properties that many\nthink they simply conflate.\n\n\nBut although intuitionists may not have confused concepts and\nproperties, they did seem to believe that there is a certain\nisomorphism between the structure of our concepts and the nature of the\nworld, such that a proper analysis of our concepts would reveal to us\nthe nature of the corresponding property or thing. This belief is not\nobviously confused, but the examples of heat and water seem to show\nthat it cannot be accepted as it stands. Intuitionists need not,\nhowever, rest their view about the property of goodness on a general\nthesis about the relation of concepts and properties. All they need do\nis identify what it is about certain concepts, like the concepts of\nwater and heat, that provides us with reasons to think that the\ncorresponding properties are different, and then argue that these\nreasons do not apply to the concept of goodness.\n\n\nWith concepts of natural properties and substances like heat and water\nwe have two reasons for thinking that the corresponding properties may\nbe different. First, the concept of heat seems metaphysically\nsuperficial and incomplete. It is the concept of a property that has\ncertain characteristic effects on us and on other things, but does not\naim to tell us about the nature of the property that has those effects.\nThe concept of water seems superficial in the same way. This concept\nonly picks out certain surface features of water, such as its being\nclear, odourless, tasteless, etc. It does not, however, tell us\nanything about the nature of the substance that has these features. In\nboth cases empirical science seems well-suited to complete this picture\nby investigating the property or substance that has these distinctive\neffects, or surface features. In doing this, empirical science provides\nus with an account of heat and water which is metaphysically deeper\nthan the one provided by the corresponding concepts.\n\n\nSecondly, even if the concept of heat were not incomplete or\nsuperficial, in so far as it is a concept of a natural property we have\ngood reason to think that the empirical sciences are much better\nequipped to discover the nature of heat than a priori reflection. The\nsame is true of the concept of water. In so far as this is a concept of\na natural substance, the empirical sciences are far better suited to\ntell us the nature of this substance than a priori reflection.\n\n\nThese reasons do not apply to the concept of goodness. First, this\nconcept does not seem to be metaphysically superficial or incomplete in\nthe way that the concept of heat or water is. When we think of\nsomething as good we do not think of it merely as having certain\neffects on us, or as picking out certain surface properties the\nproperty of goodness has, but think of it as having a distinctive\ncharacteristic. Not all intuitionists agreed with Moore that nothing\ncould be said about the nature of this characteristic (though they all\nagreed that this is a non-natural property). A. C. Ewing, for example,\nmaintained that the characteristic we have in mind when we think of\nsomething as being good is the property it has of being the fitting\nobject of a pro-attitude. If this, or something like it, is correct,\nthen the concept of goodness does not merely describe certain\nproperties goodness has, but aspires to tell us what\ngoodness\n is.[19]\nIt does not, therefore,\ncall for a metaphysically deeper account from some other source in the\nway that the concept of heat or water does.\n\n\nIt is not, however, clear that this argument will persuade critics of\nintuitionism and nonnaturalism. They may want more from an analysis of\n\u2018good\u2019. They might, for example, want an analysis that\nhelps explain why some things rather than others are good, and which\nexplains the connection between the properties that make something\ngood, and its goodness. Without these explanatory features they may\nwell regard the analysis of good offered by Ewing superficial and in\nneed of a metaphysically deeper account.\n\n\nIndeed, as Robert Shaver points out (2007, 289) according to one\nintuitionist account of good the analysis does call for a\nmetaphysically deeper account of the nature of the property. C. D.\nBroad, for instance, analyses good as meaning \n\u201cthere is one and\nonly one characteristic or set of characteristics whose presence in any\nobject that I contemplate is necessary to make me contemplate it with\napproval\u201d (1985, 283). Critics may claim that this analysis is\njust as plausible as Ewing\u2019s, and leaves room for an alternative,\nnaturalist account of the property that explains my approval.\n\n\nShaver also points out that it is a mistake to assume that synthetic\nidentities can only be established by empirical means. This is a\nmistake, because one could arrive at the conclusion that two different\nnotions refer to the same property by a priori reflection. So even if\nno empirical investigation can show that a moral and a non-moral term\npick out the same property, this might still be shown by a priori\nreflection.\n2.3 Queerness\n\n\nSome philosophers think that there could be no moral facts as\nintuitionists understand these. This is because such facts would be\nunlike any other facts of which we know. Such philosophers think of\nnon-natural facts and properties as \u2018queer\u2019 (see, Mackie\n1977; Joyce 2001; Olson 2014). This queerness is probably at the heart of many\nphilosophers\u2019 uneasiness about the idea of a non-natural\nproperty. But we need to be clear about what it is that is supposed to\nbe so queer about the non-natural nature of goodness as intuitionists\nunderstand it.\n\n\nThe intuitionist conception of goodness may be regarded as\nmysterious because it is alleged to be unanalysable or indefinable. But\nthat wouldn\u2019t pick up on the non-natural nature that\nintuitionists claim moral properties have. This objection would apply\nto any notion that philosophers claim is primitive in the sense that no\ninformative definition in other terms can be offered, be it the notion\nof explanation, knowledge, or pain. It expresses rather a certain\nphilosophical disappointment that a definition can\u2019t be offered.\nIt is often said that \u201cOne person\u2019s primitive is another\nperson\u2019s mystery\u201d, but this supposed sense of mystery\nattaches to the unanalysability claim rather than the non-naturalness\nclaim.\n\n\nFurthermore, some intuitionists did not think that goodness is\nunanalysable. For instance, Sidgwick thought that good could be\nanalysed as what ought to be desired, and Ewing maintained that it\ncould be analysed as the fitting object of a pro-attitude. If the sense\nof mystery of the intuitionist notion of goodness stems from its\nunanalysability, then this sense of mystery will not apply to these\nintuitionists\u2019 concept of goodness, even though it is still a\nnon-naturalist conception. But critics might respond that these\ndefinitions really only move the mysterious notion elsewhere, e.g., to\nthe unanalysable terms \u2018ought\u2019 and\n\u2018fittingness\u2019.\n\n\nJohn Mackie maintained that moral properties, understood broadly\nalong intuitionist lines, are queer because they are inherently\nmotivational, in the sense that when we come to see that some act is\ngood, we are motivated to do it. No other property we know of has\nsuch inherent motivational force. If such properties could be\nunderstood naturalistically, e.g., as being such as to elicit desire in\nthose who perceive them, then the inherent motivational force of moral\nproperties would not be queer. For if something\u2019s goodness were\nidentical with its being such as to elicit desire when perceived, it\nwould be no surprise that we come to desire it when we perceive\nit. But intuitionists\u2019 non-naturalism rules out this\nexplanation of the intrinsic \u2018to be pursuedness\u2019 of moral\nproperties.\n\n\nIntuitionists may respond to this objection by drawing on a recent\nversion of Ewing\u2019s fitting attitude analysis of goodness. Ewing\nthought that to be good is to be the object of a fitting pro-attitude.\nT. M. Scanlon has argued that goodness is to be understood as\nsomething\u2019s having properties that give us reason to have a\npro-attitude towards it (1998, 95), and like the intuitionist view\nabout goodness and rightness, he thinks that the notion of a reason\ncannot be understood in other, non-normative terms (1998, 17). So his\nview is something intuitionists can accept. If they do, then there\nwould seem to be no mystery about the magnetism of the good. If coming\nto see that something is good is coming to see that we have reason to\nhave a pro-attitude towards it, then it would be no surprise if\nrational individuals come to have a pro-attitude towards perceived\ngoods, any more than it would be surprising if rational beings come to\ndo what they judge they ought to do. If one has Humean leanings\none might want an explanation of how a judgement that one has reason to\nhave an attitude, or that one ought to do something, can by itself\nmotivate. But then the problem is not with the non-natural nature of\nmoral properties, but is one within moral psychology, and involves the\ndebate between those who endorse a Humean theory of motivation, and\nthose who deny this.\n\n\nBut the mystery may be normative rather motivational if we assume,\nfollowing Kant, that moral reasons are categorical reasons. Categorical\nreasons are ones that apply to us independently of what we care\nabout. One might doubt that there are any such reasons. One\nargument for such a view is that normative practical reasons must be\nthe sort of thing from which we can act. So they must be able to\nmotivate us to act, and they can only do that by latching onto\nsomething we care about. But if all practical reasons must be able to\nlatch onto something we care about, then no reasons are categorical in\nthe Kantian sense. So the very idea of a moral reason may be quite\nmysterious and queer.\n\n\nA final mystery is epistemic. It may be maintained that it is quite\nunclear how we can know of moral facts. This mystery may stem from the\nidea that non-natural properties lack causal powers. So the mystery is\nhow we could know of something that is causally impotent. Intuitionists\nmight respond by asking why a property must be causally efficacious if\nwe are to be able to know which things have that property. They may\npoint out that, on some views, dispositional properties such as warmth,\nfragility, or colour properties, lack causal powers. These powers are\nlocated in the non-dispositional base properties on which the\ndispositional properties supervene, rather than in the dispositional\nproperties themselves. If this view were true, that would not imply\nthat we could not know whether something was warm, fragile, or\ncoloured. And if that could be true of non-causal, dispositional\nproperties, then it could be true of causally impotent moral\nproperties.\n\n\nIt may, however, be pressed that the causal impotency of moral\nproperties causes problems for the analogy of intellectual seemings\nwith perceptual seemings. Perceptually things seem to be a certain way,\nsay red or square, because those things and their properties causally\ninteract with our perceptual system. But if moral properties are\ncausally impotent, then causal interaction could not explain why\ncertain things seem to the intellect to be true.\n",
