This means\nthat, using constructions from set theory, a model is defined, and\nthat natural language expressions are interpreted as elements (or\nsets, or functions) in this universe. Such a model should not be\nconceived of as a model of reality. On the one hand, the model gives\nmore than reality: natural language does not only speak about past,\npresent and future of the real world, but also about situations that\nmight be the case, or are imaginary, or cannot be the case at all. On\nthe other hand, however, the model offers less: it merely specifies\nreality as conceived by language. An example: we speak about mass\nnouns such as water as if every part of water is water again,\nas if it has no minimal parts, which physically is not correct. For\nmore information on natural language metaphysics, see Bach 1986b.\n\nMontague semantics is not interested in a particular situation (e.g.\nthe real world) but in semantical properties of language. When\nformalizing such properties, reference to a class of models has to be\nmade, and therefore the interpretation of a language will be defined\nwith respect to a set of (suitable) models. For example, in the\nintroduction we mentioned that the characterization of entailment was\na basic goal of semantics. That notion is defined as follows. Sentence\n\\(A\\) entails sentence \\(B\\) if in all models in which the\ninterpretation of \\(A\\) is true, also the interpretation of \\(B\\) is\ntrue. Likewise, a tautology is true in all models, and a contradiction\nis true in no model.\n\nAn essential feature of Montague semantics is the systematic relation\nbetween syntax and semantics. This relation is described by the\nPrinciple of Compositionality, which reads, in a formulation\nthat is standard nowadays:\n\nThe meaning of a compound expression is a function of the meanings of\nits parts and of the way they are syntactically combined. (Partee\n1984, 281)\n\n\nAn example: Suppose that the meaning of walk, or\nsing is (for each model in the class) defined as the set of\nindividuals who share respectively the property of (being an\nindividual that is) walking or the property of (being an individual\nthat is) singing. By appealing to the principle of compositionality,\nif there is a rule that combines these two expressions to the verb\nphrase walk and sing, there must be a corresponding rule that\ndetermines the meaning of that verb phrase. In this case, the\nresulting meaning will be the intersection of the two sets.\nConsequently, in all models the meaning of walk and sing is a\nsubset of the meaning of walk. Furthermore, we have a rule\nthat combines the noun phrase John with a verb phrase. The\nresulting sentence John walks and sings means that John is an\nelement of the set denoted by the verb phrase. Note that in any model\nin which John is element of the intersection of walkers and singers,\nhe is an element of the set of walkers. So John walks and\nsings entails John walks.\n\nAn important consequence of the principle of compositionality is that\nall the parts that play a role in the syntactic composition of a\nsentence must also have a meaning. And furthermore, each syntactic\nrule must be accompanied by a semantic rule which says how the meaning\nof the compound is obtained. Thus, the meaning of an expression is\ndetermined by the way in which the expression is formed, and as such\nthe derivational history plays a role in determining the meaning. For\nfurther discussion, see Section\n 2.5.\n\nThe formulation of the aim of Montague semantics mentioned in the\nintroduction (\u2018to characterize truth and entailment of\nsentences\u2019) suggests that the method is restricted to\ndeclarative sentences. But this need not be the case. In Montague 1973\n(241 fn) we already find suggestions for how to deal with imperatives\nand questions. Hamblin (1973) and Karttunen (1977) have given a\nsemantics for questions by analyzing them as expressing sets of\npropositions, viz. those expressed by their (declarative) answers; an\nalternative approach, taken by Groenendijk and Stokhof (1989)\nconsiders questions as partitioning logical space into mutually\nexcluding possibilities.\n\nSince Montague only considered sentences in isolation, certain\ncommentators pointed out that the sentence boundary was a serious\nlimitation for the approach. But what about discourse? An obvious\nrequirement is that the sentences from a discourse are interpreted one\nby one. How then to treat co-referentiality of anaphora over sentence\nboundaries? The solution which was proposed first was Discourse\nRepresentation Theory (Kamp 1981). On the one hand, that was an\noffspring of Montague\u2019s approach because it used model theoretic\nsemantics; on the other hand, it was a deviation because (discourse)\nrepresentations were an essential ingredient. Nowadays there are\nseveral reformulations of DRT that fit into Montague\u2019s framework\n(see van Eijck and Kamp 1997). A later solution was based upon a\nchange of the logic; dynamic Montague semantics was developed and that\ngave a procedure for binding free variables in logic which has an\neffect on subsequent formulas (Groenendijk and Stokhof 1990, 1991).\nHence the sentence boundary is not a fundamental obstacle for Montague\nsemantics.\n",
