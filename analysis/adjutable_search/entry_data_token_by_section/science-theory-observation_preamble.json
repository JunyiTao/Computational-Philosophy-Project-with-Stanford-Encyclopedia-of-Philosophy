    "main_text": "\n\nScientists obtain a great deal of the evidence they use by collecting\nand producing empirical results. Much of the standard philosophical\nliterature on this subject comes from 20th century logical\nempiricists, their followers, and critics who embraced their issues\nwhile objecting to some of their aims and assumptions. Discussions\nabout empirical evidence have tended to focus on epistemological\nquestions regarding its role in theory testing. This entry follows\nthat precedent, even though empirical evidence also plays important\nand philosophically interesting roles in other areas including\nscientific discovery, the development of experimental tools and\ntechniques, and the application of scientific theories to practical\nproblems.\n\nThe logical empiricists and their followers devoted much of their\nattention to the distinction between observables and unobservables,\nthe form and content of observation reports, and the epistemic bearing\nof observational evidence on theories it is used to evaluate.\nPhilosophical work in this tradition was characterized by the aim of\nconceptually separating theory and observation, so that observation\ncould serve as the pure basis of theory appraisal. More recently, the\nfocus of the philosophical literature has shifted away from these\nissues, and their close association to the languages and logics of\nscience, to investigations of how empirical data are generated,\nanalyzed, and used in practice. With this shift, we also see\nphilosophers largely setting aside the aspiration of a pure\nobservational basis for scientific knowledge and instead embracing a\nview of science in which the theoretical and empirical are usefully\nintertwined. This entry discusses these topics under the following\nheadings:\n",
