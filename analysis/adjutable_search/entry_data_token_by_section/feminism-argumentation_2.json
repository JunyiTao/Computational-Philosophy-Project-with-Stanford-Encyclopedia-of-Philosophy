    "main_text": "Arguing to Win || The Adversary Paradigm and the discipline of philosophy\n1.2 The Adversary Paradigm and the discipline of philosophy\n\nNorms of masculine aggression may help a particular reasoning method\nto dominate the discipline of philosophy, Janice Moulton argues in an\nearly article (1983). She describes the process of competitive\nreasoning through deductive refutation\u2014typically by\ncounter-example\u2014as the \u201cAdversary\n Method\u201d.[3]\n According to Moulton, the Method employs opposing views on a topic as\ntests for each other\u2014the more severe the opposition, the better,\nand surviving the confrontation grants \u201cobjectivity\u201d to a\nview. Winning at arguing in this fashion depends on defeating\ncompeting positions based on faults identified in them. Defeat of the\nopposite position becomes more decisive when the claims are very\nspecific, as specificity aids deductive refutation.\n\nPhilosophy, at least in Moulton\u2019s (1983) context of late\ntwentieth century Anglo-American or \u201canalytic\u201d philosophy,\nmay be so permeated by the combination of adversarial arguing and\ndeductive logic that the Adversary Method operates as a disciplinary\n\u201cparadigm\u201d. Moulton argues that this\n\u201cparadigm\u201d for philosophy demands aggressive opposition to\nother people\u2019s opinions, in the same way that Thomas Kuhn\nobserved that mature scientific disciplines demand adherence to an\noverarching theory, an ideal, and a practice that together constitute\na cultural paradigm. Philosophers\u2019 technique of aiming to\nfalsify each other\u2019s claims reflects Karl Popper\u2019s\nepistemology but adversarial reasoning in philosophy has taken many\ndifferent forms and traces back at least to Aristotle. Descartes and\nKant shifted the normative focus of the study of logic from dialogue\nto individual cognition, and the logic of opposition became\ninternalized (Dutilh Novaes 2011, 2015). Yet, arguing as a dialogical\nform of reasoning retains the oppositional dynamic.\n\nMoulton criticizes how the operation of the Adversary Method as a\nparadigm can hobble the progress of philosophical reasoning by\nnarrowing the possibilities for discussion. Isolating claims maximizes\ntheir vulnerability and prepares them for Adversarial testing, forcing\nproponents to rely on ad hoc revisions, and prohibiting the\nsystematic reconsiderations that encourage theories to evolve. For\ninstance, ad hoc concessions \u201cfor the sake of\nargument\u201d create common ground for discussion only by\nrestricting the basis for disagreement; and so, Moulton maintains,\nthey slow the development of philosophical thought (1983:\n154\u2013155).\n\nMoulton (1983) argues that the narrow discourse of the Adversary\nMethod seriously limits the relevance of philosophy to feminist\nconcerns. She takes the example of Judith Jarvis Thomson\u2019s\nclassic philosophical defense of the moral permissibility of abortion\nthat concedes a great deal (that the fetus is a full-fledged person\nwith a right to life) to show that the right to life does not\nsupersede the right to bodily autonomy. Moulton\u2019s concern is\nthat even though Thomson\u2019s position supports feminist\ntheoretical views, it employs reasoning so remote from the\ncircumstances of pregnancy that it provides no guidance for people\nseeking to make decisions about actual abortions. Taking the purpose\nof arguing to be the defeat of a view limits the practical relevance\nof the argumentative exchange.\n\nMoulton makes a further related point that forcing narrow theories to\ncompete can make philosophy look quite absurd. Moral arguments are\ndirected at egoists and epistemology is offered to skeptics. Debates\nover the existence of the external world and the existence of God\noccupy philosophers at the expense of attention to the character of\nthe world we live in or the role of God in our religions. Philosophers\nrarely question the assumption that there must be a supreme moral\nprinciple, Moulton explains, because otherwise there would be little\nsense to making different theories compete for recognized supremacy\n(1983: 157\u2013158). Losing sight of other reasons for arguing may\nhave even resulted in the misinterpretation of key figures in the\nhistory of philosophy. Moulton suggests that interpreters often miss\nvarious purposes for which Socrates argued because they assume that\nhis only goal was refutation (1983: 155\u2013157). The assumption\nthat the Adversary Method drives philosophical progress may distort\nphilosophers\u2019 understanding of the value of their own\ndiscipline.\n\nThe Adversary Method\u2019s prevalence and constitution of a Kuhnian\nparadigm may be recognized in Rooney\u2019s observation that\nphilosophers tend to engage each other from a \u201cdefault skeptical\nstance\u201d. The skeptical stance challenges the quality of the\ncomponents of another\u2019s arguments, including the basis for\npremises, the support premises provide for the conclusion, and the\npossibility of counterexamples. The skeptical stance operates as a\ndefault without consideration of the appropriateness of the challenges\nfor the topic under discussion. Rooney notes in particular,\n\n\nskeptical argumentative responses that take necessary truths and valid\narguments as the ideal poorly serve the variety of arguments and forms\nof argumentation that important philosophical works have presented and\nwill continue to present. (2012: 321)\n\n\nInappropriate standards undermine the general epistemic aims of truth\nand understanding. They create specific problems for discussion of\nsocial justice issues which depends extensively on testimony and\ntherefore on deft employment of the epistemology of testimony and\nsensitivity to the danger of testimonial injustice (see\n Section 4 on Credibility and argument interpretation).\n The unsuitability of the Adversary Method for discussions of social\njustice will stall social justice projects, Rooney concludes,\nincluding those within the discipline of philosophy.\n\nHundleby presents as evidence for the paradigmatic operation of the\nAdversary Method an analysis of critical thinking textbooks in\nphilosophy. Twenty-four textbooks of the thirty\nexamined\u2014four-fifths\u2014revealed in their presentation of\nfallacies the norms of the Adversary Method: narrow discourse and\ndecisive refutation. Most of these textbooks exhibiting the Adversary\nParadigm have authors with no research expertise in argumentation more\nspecific than doctoral training in philosophy, whereas the much\nsmaller number of textbooks (six out of thirty) authored by scholars\nof argumentation do not show the same signs of the Adversary Method.\nGiven this evidence that argumentation scholarship differently orients\nargument pedagogy, the prevalence of the Adversary Method in so many\nother textbooks seems to derive simply from the disciplinary culture\nof philosophy (Hundleby 2010).\n\nSome empirical educational studies suggest, too, that while students\nlearn a great deal from learning eristic practices of argument, it\nundermines their progress as learners by emphasizing winning over\ngaining understanding (Makau & Marty 2013: 13).\nPeople\u2014including feminists\u2014Moulton (1983) suggests, might\nexpect more relevant advice from the discipline of philosophy. More\npractical philosophies addressing mundane problems also may be found\noutside Euro-American cultures (Olberding 2015).\n",
