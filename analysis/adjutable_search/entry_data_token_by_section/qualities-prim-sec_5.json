Some suggest that\nhis best argument is the intelligibility, simplicity, and explanatory\nadequacy of his mechanist theory (CSM 1.284\u201386, 288; AT\n7.121\u2013123, 326). But it is conclusive only in conjunction with\nthe norm expressed by Ockham\u2019s razor. (Downing 2011:\n113\u201314). Another problem is that Descartes writes that his\nmechanist physics explains the nature of light, heat, etc. because he\npresupposes that they are \u201conly in our senses\u2026 and not in\nthe objects we perceive by sense\u201d (Letter to Chanut,26 Feb 1649;\nCSM 3.369; AT 5.291\u20132). It is doubtful Descartes would advance\nthe explanatory adequacy argument unless he had an independent\nargument for the presupposition (for a different analysis, see Downing\n2011: 114).\n\nIt might seem Meditations offers such an argument. It states\nthat our most common mistake about ideas in general consists in\njudging that they resemble things outside us (CSM 2.26; AT 7.37). Some\nscholars take this to be an attack on Aristotelian realism, but the\nargument is elusive. The problem is that the context indicates that\nassuming resemblance is an epistemic mistake but not necessarily a\nfactual one (e.g., CSM 2.57; AT 7.82\u20133). That is, making the\nassumption is assenting to something we have no reason to think is\ntrue; but it may nevertheless be true. Perceptual realism about SQs\ntacitly goes by the board, but the opponent in view is the epistemic\nstance of those who formed the habit of implicitly relying on their\nsenses as children and never reflected on its value for acquiring true\nbeliefs. (For this interpretation of Descartes\u2019 method of doubt,\nsee Patterson 2007.)\n\nLisa Downing (2011: 115\u201317) argues that the first part of\nPrinciples of Philosophy (hereafter Principles),\narticles 66\u201371 provides basis for an a priori argument\nwhich Descartes could have had in mind but never stated. The articles\nexplain what we clearly and distinctly perceive about color, what we\nmight mistakenly judge about it, and what we can judge about its\nrelation to bodies without error. According to Principles\n1.71, sensations of heat, color, etc. \u201cdo not represent anything\nlocated outside our thought\u201d (CSM 1.219; AT 8.35) Based on this,\nDowning (2011: 118\u201328) constructs a valid argument to show ideas\nof SQs as we sense them cannot exit in a substance with the principle\nattribute extension. But she argues, it requires the principle\nattribute of a body to be absolute geometrical extension and modes to\nbe its limits. She finds this too restrictive to be tenable because it\nexcludes modes such as force and inertia and it is a model of the\nattribute-mode relation that cannot be applied to substances with the\nprincipal attribute thought.\n3.2.2 The metaphysical status of SQs\n\nA few scholars maintain that heat, e.g., is nothing other than a\nsensation on the strength of Principles 1.70\u201371 (Vinci\n1998: 199\u2013200; MacKenzie 1990: 114\u201316). However, the\nscientific writings offer mechanist accounts of light and color as\nspecific sorts of motions of insensible particles and suggest other\nSQs, too, are micro physical configurations (e.g., Optics,\nCSM 1.153, 155\u20136; AT 8.84\u20135, 88). Cottingham (1990:\n237\u201338) among others cites a text that may seem to identify\nsensible qualities with causal dispositions (CSM 1.285; AT\n 8.323),[3]\n but Wolf-Devine (1993: 46\u20138) convincingly argues that the\npassage refers to mechanist microstructures. Other commentators\nmaintain that Descartes either vacillates between mental and physical\nviews of color or has an inconsistent theory (M. Wilson 1992: 228,\n234; Wolf-Devine 1993: 46\u20138). However several more charitable\ninterpretations accommodate both. According to Atherton (2004),\nDescartes\u2019 opposition to certain scholastic doctrines motivates\na bifurcated theory of color consisting of a mechanist physiological\naccount paired with a mentalist psychological account of sense\nperception. She finds nothing that unites the parts of an essentially\ndualist theory of perception. According to Nolan (2011a), Descartes is\na nominalist about SQs: they are abstractions from experience that\nhave no de re counterparts. They are names we use to refer to\nboth certain ideas and certain bodily modes. However, it seems the\nstatus of SQs should be understood as that of entities that emerge in\nthe mind-body union in an environment such as ours (see Alanen 2005:\n147\u2013164; also Brown & Normore [2019: 185\u20136] who argue\nthat the union is a subject of predicates without mentioning SQs).\nThis view of SQs is explicit in Principles, Part I (CSM\n1.208\u201309; AT 8.22\u201323).\n3.2.3 The intentionality of ideas of SQs\n\nDescartes repeatedly says we mistakenly suppose the things represented\nby ideas of SQs resemble the ideas. Is it possible for ideas to\nrepresent things and yet be misleading about what they are? The issue\ncomes to a head in remarks about \u201cmaterially false\u201d ideas\nin Mediation 3. This is a non-judgmental sort of falsity\n\u201cthat occurs in ideas when they represent non-things as\nthings\u201d; for instance, ideas of heat and cold do not enable us\nto know whether one is the privation of the other, both are privative,\nor both are positive. Because there cannot be an idea that is not\nintentional, or of something, the idea that represents it as something\npositive should be called false (CSM 2.30; AT.7, 43\u201344). Arnauld\nobjects that on Descartes\u2019 theory, X cannot exist\nobjectively in the mind as something other than it is; were the idea\nof X materially false, it would not be an idea of X\n(CSM 2.145\u201346; AT 7.206\u201307). Three points in\nDescartes\u2019 reply are reasonably clear. First, material falsity\ndoes not have to do with the relation between an idea and its object\nbut with the mental operation that makes the object appear in a manner\nthat does not enable us to tell whether its object is privative or\npositive (CSM 2.162\u20133; AT 7.232). Second, ideas of SQs are\nconfused and obscure; they involve sensations which are often wrongly\ntaken to be the objects the ideas represent. Third, Descartes agrees\nwith Arnauld: the idea of cold, e.g., cannot represent cold as\nsomething it is not (CSM 2.164; AT 7.234; for a different\ninterpretation, see M. Wilson 1978: 114\u201316). The upshot is that\nideas of color etc. are confused. They provide opportunity for error\nbut are not erroneous representations (Hatfield 2011: 143\u2013148).\nScholars disagree about how to interpret these texts in an internally\nconsistent way. There are two basic positions:\n\nColors, etc. are non-intentional sensations;\nIdeas of color, etc. are intentional but confused or obscure.\n\nSQs are non-intentional sensations\n\nSeveral scholars urge that in Descartes\u2019 considered opinion, SQs\nare sensations without representative content (M. Wilson 1978:\n114\u201316; Vinci 1998: 196\u201398, 199\u2013200; MacKenzie\n1990). This is based on Principles 1.68 and 70, which say\nthat colors, etc, are clearly known when they are regarded merely as\nsensations and we make no error if we judge there is something in\nbodies whose nature we do not know which causes the sensations in us.\nBut these texts would mark a change of mind if they implied these\nideas represent nothing but what we clearly know. The scholars\nmentioned in the next section are among those who are not persuaded\nthat Descartes abandons the view of ideas of SQs in\nMeditation 3 and the exchange with Arnauld.\nIdeas of SQs are intentional and confused\n\nThere are two things advocates of this view have to explain: what the\nintentional objects of these ideas are and what is the source of the\nconfusion that stops short of misrepresentation. The literature offers\nseveral carefully developed accounts but brief descriptions will have\nto suffice here.\n\nSQ ideas do not intrinsically or presentationally represent\nmodifications of bodies but some texts imply they extrinsically\nrepresent things in our environment such as their causes (M. Wilson\n1990 [1999]; Schmaltz 1992). See De Rosa (2010: 69\u201393) for\ncritical discussion.\nSimmons (2001) maintains ideas of SQs have teleo-semantic content.\nThey represent things in the external world that are beneficial or\nharmful to the perceiver. This is critically discussed by Detlefsen\n(2013a) and De Rosa (2010).\nDe Rosa (2010: 117\u201361) argues that the idea of color has two\ncomponents: a manifest phenomenal presentation caused by interaction\nbetween parts of the body and the mind, and a latent clear and\ndistinct idea of the external corporeal cause of the idea. The idea\nmisrepresents the entity it represents because the representative\naspect is latent. See Paul and Morrison (2014) for critical\ndiscussion.\nLilli Alanen (2003: 147\u2013164) offers a comprehensive, complex\nand subtle account of materially false ideas. Two features of this\ninterpretation broadly considered can be mentioned here. Sensory ideas\nin general represent elements and events comprised in the mind/body\nunion and do so by virtue of the complex relation that unites the mind\nand body. To this extent, they are intrinsically representative and\nineliminably confused because the union is unintelligible to us. In\naddition, sensory ideas are signs of the external objects that cause\nthem, informing us of their existence, changes, and effects on us. In\nthis capacity, they have extrinsic content which is, again,\nincomprehensible to us. A second point is that sensory ideas comprise\nsensations and unnoticed judgments which accrue to them in childhood;\nsome of these judgments ascribe qualities to objects they do not have.\nIn this respect, ideas of SQs, and perhaps some PQs, are materially\nfalse.\nGary Hatfield (2013: 138\u2013148) offers another comprehensive\nand subtle account. Here we can sketch three points. Ideas of colors,\netc. are intrinsically representational; they represent by virtue of a\nsimilitude that is not phenomenally recognizable but understood with\nthe aid of metaphysics and natural philosophy. They manifestly\nrepresent external objects as having colors, being red, e.g., and they\nobscurely represent micro-structural modes of bodies. So they accord\nwith the account of material falsity in the Fourth Replies, i.e., they\ngive opportunity for false belief and still represent their objects as\nthey are. This comports well with relevant texts but the supposed\nsimilitude between SQs as we perceive them and configurations of\ninsensible particles in motion may strain credulity.\n\n",
