They\nare, as Foucher (2007: 28) put it, \u201ctraces of time inscribed in\nspace\u201d, always in flux between division and union, between the\n\u201cscars\u201d of history (Mozer 1973: 14) and the\n\u201cseams\u201d of geography (Cinalli and Jacobson 2020: 43). Even\nin times of peace there are entire industries (of real estate law,\ncadastral registration, land surveying) as well as a host of\nadministrative offices (of passport control, customs and immigration\ncheck, etc.) that are devoted to the maintenance of such traces\n(Crawford 2022). The ancient Romans actually had a god, Terminus,\npresiding over all boundary markers, with a major\n\u201cTerminalia\u201d festival celebrated yearly on the last day of\ntheir calendar (Dionysius, Roman Antiquities, II, 74; Ovid,\nFasti, II, 639\u2013684; Plutarch, Roman Questions,\nXV, Numa, XVI).\n\nIt is hard to regard all of this as being merely about some abstract\nfa\u00e7on de parler. But it is equally hard to locate the\nsource of its enormous importance in our political and social\nlives, disentangling myth from science, culture from nature, power\nfrom government. The emergence of \u201cborder studies\u201d as a\nbroadly interdisciplinary field of research bears witness to the\nincreasing awareness of these difficulties and of their practical and\ntheoretical importance (see Wastl-Walter 2011 and Wilson and Donnan\n2012 for comprehensive handbooks). And while the interdisciplinary\nnature of the field draws primarily from geography, anthropology,\nsociology, environmental psychology, economics, political science, and\nlaw, deep down the issues belong to the very core of political\nphilosophy and deliver further perspectives from which to assess the\nphilosophical significance of borders, frontiers, and boundaries more\ngenerally. (See e.g. the recent publication of Cooper and Tinning\n2019.)\n",
