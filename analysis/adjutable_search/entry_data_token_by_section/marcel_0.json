    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nMarcel was born in 1889. His mother died when he was only four, and\nMarcel was raised by his father and aunt, who later married. He\nexcelled in school, but did so without enjoying his studies prior to\nhis encounter with philosophy. He associated with many of the\nprominent philosophers of his day, in part due to his hosting of the\nfamous \u201cFriday evenings.\u201d Paul Ricoeur, Emmanuel Levinas,\nJean Wahl, Simone de Beauvoir, Nicolas Berdyaev and Jean-Paul Sartre\nwere among the many noted philosophers who attended these gatherings\nat one time or another. These informal meetings were an occasion for\nengaged thinkers from a variety of perspectives to discuss together\nvarious philosophical themes, frequently ones Marcel himself was\nworking on that week. After passing his agr\u00e9gation in\n1910, he taught philosophy intermittently in Sens, Paris, and\nMontpellier; however, his main professional occupations were that of\ndrama critic (for Europe nouvelle and later for Nouvelles\nlitt\u00e9raires) and editor (for the Feux\ncrois\u00e9s series at Plon).\n\nMarcel\u2019s philosophical legacy includes lectures, journal entries\nand dramatic works in addition to more orthodox philosophical\nexpression in essays and monographs. Of these various genres, Marcel\nwas perhaps most pleased with his dramatic works. In fact, reading\nbetween the lines of his autobiographical remarks, one can discern\nsome puzzlement and no small amount of frustration at the success of\nhis philosophical works and the relative obscurity of his dramatic\nworks. Complicating the diverse expression of his ideas is the fact\nthat Marcel was a consciously unsystematic philosopher, something he\nrealized as early as the publication of his Journal\nm\u00e9taphysique (1927).\n [1]\n Nevertheless, while the diverse expression of his thought and the\nrelated lack of systematicity cause some difficulty for those\ninterested in Marcel\u2019s work, the main themes of his thought are\npresent in many of his works. Especially noteworthy are: The\nMystery of Being, Creative Fidelity, Homo Viator,\nBeing and Having, Tragic Wisdom and Beyond and the\nconcise \u201cOn the Ontological Mystery.\u201d\n\nMarcel\u2019s philosophical methodology was unique, although it bears\nsome resemblance to both existentialism and phenomenology broadly\nconstrued. He insisted that philosophy begin with concrete experience\nrather than abstractions. To this end he makes constant use of\nexamples in order to ground the philosophical ideas he is\ninvestigating. The method itself consists in \u201cworking\u2026up\nfrom life to thought and then down from thought to life again, so that\n[one] may try to throw more light upon life\u201d (Marcel 1951a, p.\n41). Thus, this philosophy is a sort of \u201cdescription bearing\nupon the structures which reflection elucidates starting from\nexperience\u201d (Marcel 1962a, p. 180). In addition, Marcel\nexpressed a refreshing preference for philosophizing in ordinary\nlanguage. He maintained that \u201cwe should employ current forms of\nordinary language which distort our experiences far less than the\nelaborate expressions in which philosophical language is\ncrystallized\u201d (Marcel 1965, p. 158). Marcel was consistently\ncritical of Cartesianism, especially the epistemological problems with\nwhich Cartesianism is mainly concerned (such as the problem of\nskepticism). Like many of the existentialists, his critique was\nmotivated by a rejection of that account of the nature of the self\nwhich was assumed in Descartes\u2019 overall approach to the question\nof knowledge, and how the mind comes to know reality. The Cartesian\npicture of the self assumes that the self is a discrete entity with a\nneatly defined \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside,\u201d so that\nour ideas, which are \u201cinside,\u201d can be fully understood\nwithout reference to the world, which is \u201coutside.\u201d\n\u201cCartesianism implies a severance \u2026 between intellect and\nlife; its result is a depreciation of the one, and an exaltation of\nthe other, both arbitrary\u201d (Marcel, 1949, p. 170). Marcel agreed\nwith other thinkers in the existentialist tradition, such as\nHeidegger, that the Cartesian view of the self is not\nontologically basic for the human subject because it is not a\npresentation of how the self actually is. Part of Marcel\u2019s task\nis to try to reveal phenomenologically the true nature of the subject,\nwhich will have implications for many philosophical issues, including\nthose relating to the nature of knowledge. However, on the issue of\nthe true nature of the subject, Marcel differs from both Heidegger and\nSartre; indeed, his views are closer to those of Jewish philosopher,\nMartin Buber, than they are to many of the existentialists.\n\n",
