    "main_text": "Faith as a virtue\n10. Faith as a virtue\n\nFaith is traditionally regarded as one of the\n\u2018theological\u2019 virtues. If a virtue is a \u2018disposition\nof character which instantiates or promotes responsiveness to one or\nmore basic goods\u2019, then theistic faith qualifies since it is\n\u2018a responsiveness to practical hope and truth\u2019, provided\ntheistic faith-claims are indeed true (Chappell 1996, 27). Faith will\nnot, however, be a virtue as such, if it is accepted that\nfaith can be misplaced or, even, \u2018demonic\u2019, directed upon\na \u2018false ultimate\u2019 (Tillich 1957 [2001, 21]). To be\nvirtuous, faith must be faith in a worthy object: it is faith in\nGod that is the theological virtue. More generally, faith is\nvirtuous only when it is faith to which one is entitled. An account of\nthe conditions under which faith is permissible is thus the key to an\nethics of faith.\n\nOn models of faith as a (special) kind of knowledge, or as firmly held\nbelief, it may seem puzzling how faith could be a virtue\u2014unless\nsome implicit practical component emerges when such models are further\nexplicated, or, alternatively, a case may be made for the claim that\nwhat is involuntary may nevertheless be praiseworthy, with theist\nfaith as a case in point (Adams 1987). (For discussion of how faith\nmight be voluntary, even if faith entails belief, or indeed is a type\nof belief, and belief is not under our direct voluntary control, see\nRettler 2018.) Furthermore, as already suggested (Sections 4 & 5\nabove), models of faith as knowledge or belief fail to provide\nnon-circular conditions sufficient for entitlement, unless the truth\nof faith-propositions is established by independent argument and\nevidence. If faith is understood as, or as essentially including,\nbeliefs held on insufficient evidence, it is also hard to understand\nwhy Abrahamic religious traditions have valued it so highly, let alone\nwhy God might be thought to make salvation contingent on such belief\n(Kvanvig 2018, 106; McKaughan and Howard-Snyder 2021).\n\nFiducial models of faith seem more attuned to exhibiting faith as a\nvirtue, though a defence of the trustworthiness of the one who is\ntrusted for salvation may be required. Doxastic and non-doxastic\nventure models of faith can vindicate faith as a virtue, provided they\nprovide robust entitlement conditions, to ensure that not just any\n\u2018leap of faith\u2019 is permissible. The Jamesian account\nalready mentioned (Section 7) aims to meet this need. James\u2019s\nown view of what suffices to justify a faith-venture arguably needs an\nethical supplement: both the non-evidential motivation for the venture\nand its content must be morally acceptable (Bishop 2007a,\n163\u20136).\n\nIf faith of the religious kind is to count as valuable and/or\nvirtuous, it seems there must be a suitable degree of resilience in\nthe commitment made (see Howard-Snyder and McKaughan 2022b for\narguments that faith requires resilience; for discussion of the value\nand potential virtuousness or viciousness of resilient faith see\nMcKaughan and Howard-Snyder 2023a; on the rationality of resilient\nfaith see Buchak 2017, Jackson 2021, and McKaughan 2016). Persons of\nreligious faith and faithfulness both put their faith in and are\nfaithful to the object of their commitment, though the\nsalient kind of faithfulness may be a matter of the continual renewal\nof faith rather than of maintaining it unchanged (Pace and McKaughan\n2020). (See Audi 2014 for a discussion of faith and faithfulness in\nrelation to virtue. Audi defends faithfulness as, like courage, an\n\u2018adjunctive\u2019 virtue, and argues that being \u2018a person\nof faith\u2019 counts as a \u2018virtue of personality\u2019.)\n\nFaith is only one of the Christian theological virtues, of course, the\nothers being hope and charity (or love, agap\u0113): St. Paul\nfamously affirms that the greatest of these is love (I Cor. 13:13).\nThe question thus arises how these three virtues are related. One\nsuggestion is that faith is taking it to be true that there are\ngrounds for the hope that love is supreme\u2014not simply in the\nsense that love constitutes the ideal of the supreme good, but in the\nsense that living in accordance with this ideal constitutes an\nultimate salvation, fulfilment or consummation that is, in reality,\nvictorious over all that may undermine it (in a word, over evil). The\nsupremacy of love is linked to the supremacy of the divine itself,\nsince love is the essential nature of the divine. What is hoped for,\nand what faith assures us is properly hoped for, is a sharing\nin the divine itself, loving as God loves (see Brian Davies on\nAquinas, 2002). On this understanding, reducing faith to a kind of\nhope (Section 9 above) would eradicate an important relation between\nthe two\u2014namely that people of faith take reality to be such that\ntheir hope (for salvation, the triumph of the good) is well founded,\nand not merely an attractive fantasy or inspiring ideal. (See Jeffrey\n2017 for discussion of the moral permissibility of faith, particularly\nin connection with hope.)\n",
