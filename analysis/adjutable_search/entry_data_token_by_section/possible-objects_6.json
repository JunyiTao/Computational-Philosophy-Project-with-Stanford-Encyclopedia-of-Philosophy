    "main_text": "Unicorns\n4. Unicorns\n\nIf anything is a non-actual possible object, a unicorn is. Or so it\nappears. But Kripke vigorously argues against such a view in the 1980\nversion of Kripke 1972: 24, 156\u201358. His argument starts with the\nassumption that the unicorn is (intended to be) an animal species if\nanything. This excludes the possibility that a horse with a horn\nartificially attached to its forehead is a unicorn. Kripke assumes\nobviously that there are actually no unicorns and that unicorns are\npurely mythical creatures. Also assumed is the absence in the relevant\nmyth of any specification of the genetic structure, evolutionary\nhistory, or other potentially defining essential features of the\nunicorn. (Possession of a horn is not a defining essential feature of\nthe unicorn any more than having tawny stripes is a defining feature\nof the tiger.) The myth describes the unicorn only in stereotypical\nterms: looking like a horse, having a horn protruding from its\nforehead, etc. Suppose that there are objects with all such\nstereotypical features of the unicorn. This seems perfectly possible\nand Kripke accepts such a possibility. But he rejects its sufficiency\nfor establishing the possibility of unicorns. Suppose that among the\nobjects with the stereotypical unicorn features, some have a genetic\nmakeup, an evolutionary history, or some other potentially defining\nessential unicorn characteristic which is radically different from the\ncorresponding characteristic had by the others with the same\nstereotypical unicorn features. Which ones among those with the\nstereotypical unicorn features would then be real unicorns and which\nones fool\u2019s unicorns (\u00e0 la fool\u2019s gold)?\nThere is no fact of the matter. Given that the unicorn is an animal\nspecies, not everything that looks and behaves like a unicorn is\nguaranteed to be a unicorn. To be a unicorn, an object has to possess\nthe defining essential characteristics of the unicorn. But there are\nno defining characteristics of the unicorn; the myth does not specify\nthem, and the universe does not instantiate them. This surprising\nargument has convinced many philosophers of the impossibility of\nunicorns, but others have raised doubt by arguing that the notion of a\nbiological kind, such as a species, is far more malleable than Kripke\nassumes (Dupr\u00e9 1993).\n\nThe line of argument Kripke uses, if successful, is applicable to all\nnon-actual natural kinds and their analogs (except for natural-kind\nanalogs of Kaplan\u2019s automobile or Salmon\u2019s Noman). It is\nunclear that it or something like it is successfully applicable to\nindividuals like Vulcan, but if it is, then we must say that such\nindividuals are impossible objects. Some theorists liken Vulcan to\nfictional objects, as we will see in the next section, and some\ntheorists argue that fictional objects are impossible objects (Kaplan\n1973, 1980 version of Kripke 1972: 157\u201358, Fine 1984:\n126\u201328, Yagisawa 2010: 271\u201377). If Vulcan is an impossible\nobject, the problem of uniquely specifying Vulcan, as opposed to\nNacluv, becomes less urgent, for it is not evident that we should be\nable to specify an impossible object uniquely and non-trivially.\n",
