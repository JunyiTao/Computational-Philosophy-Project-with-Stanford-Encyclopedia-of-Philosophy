    "main_text": "\nThe sense of touch is one of the central forms of perceptual\nexperience, though it has often been overshadowed by vision in both philosophy and psychology.  Thought to be one of the first senses to develop, touch occurs\nacross the whole body using a variety of receptors in the skin. It\noften combines these signals with feedback from the muscles and tendons as we actively move and\nexplore the world, and with proprioceptive information about the position of our tactual surfaces. These unique features of touch raise many\ninteresting philosophical issues. In particular, it is a central topic of discussion in debates about the\nmultisensory nature of perception, the relation between perception and\naction, and the connection between touch and bodily awareness.\n",
