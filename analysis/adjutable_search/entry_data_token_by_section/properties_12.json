    "main_text": "Exemplification || Self-exemplification\n2.4 Self-exemplification\n\nPresumably, properties exemplify properties. For example, if\nproperties are abstract objects, as is usually thought, then seemingly\nevery property exemplifies abstractness. But then we should also grant\nthat there is self-exemplification, i.e., a property exemplifying\nitself. For example, abstractness is itself abstract and thus\nexemplifies itself. Self-exemplification however has raised severe\nperplexities at least since Plato.\n\nPlato appears to hold that all properties exemplify\nthemselves, when he claims that forms participate in themselves. This\nclaim is crucially involved in his so-called third man\nargument, which led him to worry that his theory of forms is\nincoherent (Parmenides, 132 ff.). As we see matters now, it\nis not clear why we should hold that all properties exemplify\nthemselves (Armstrong 1978a: 71); for instance, people are honest, but\nhonesty itself is not honest (see, however, the entry on\n Plato\u2019s Parmenides,\n and Marmodoro forthcoming).\n\nNowadays, a more serious worry related to self-exemplification is\nRussell\u2019s famous paradox, constructed as regarding the property\nof non-self-exemplification, which appears to exemplify itself iff it\ndoes not, thus defying the laws of logic, at least classical logic.\nThe discovery of his paradox (and then the awareness of related\npuzzles) led Russell to introduce a theory of types, which institutes\na total ban on self-predication by a rigid segregation of properties\ninto a hierarchy of types (more on this in\n \u00a76.1).\n The account became more complex and rigid, as Russell moved from\nsimple to ramified type theory, which involves a\ndistinction of orders within types (see entries on\n type theory\n and\n Russell\u2019s paradox,\n and, for a detailed reconstruction of how Russell reacted to the\nparadox, Landini 1998).\n\nIn type theory all properties are, we may say, typed. This\napproach has never gained unanimous consensus and its many problematic\naspects are well-known (see, e.g., Fitch 1952: Appendix C; Bealer\n1989). Just to mention a few, the type-theoretical hierarchy imposed\non properties appears to be highly artificial and multiplies\nproperties ad infinitum (e.g., since presumably properties\nare abstract, for any property \\(P\\) of type \\(n\\), there is an\nabstractness of type \\(n+1\\) that \\(P\\) exemplifies). Moreover, many\ncases of self-exemplification are innocuous and common. For example,\nthe property of being a property is itself a property, so it\nexemplifies itself. Accordingly, many recent proposals are type-free\n(see\n \u00a76.1)\n and thus view properties as untyped, capable of being\nself-predicated, sometimes veridically. An additional motivation to\nmove in this direction is a new paradox proposed by Orilia and Landini\n(2019), which affects simple type theory. It is\n\u201ccontingent\u201d in that it is derived from a contingent\nassumption, namely that someone, say John, is thinking just about the\nproperty of being a property \\(P\\) such that John is thinking of\nsomething that is not exemplified by \\(P\\).\n",
