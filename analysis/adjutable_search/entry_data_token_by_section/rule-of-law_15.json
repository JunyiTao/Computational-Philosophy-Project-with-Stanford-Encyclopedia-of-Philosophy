    "main_text": "Opposition to the Rule of Law\n7. Opposition to the Rule of Law\n\nNo account of the Rule of Law is complete if it does not mention the\nways in which this ideal is deprecated. The laudatory history of the\nRule of Law in the work of thinkers like Aristotle, Locke, Dicey,\nHayek and Fuller has been matched by opponents of legality such as\nPlato (in The Statesman), Thomas Hobbes (at least if the Rule\nof Law is supposed to take us beyond rule by law), and Carl Schmitt\n1923 (in his attack on parliamentarism and on the liberal assumption\nthat rules can prevail even under conditions of endemic crisis).\n\nThe criticism by Plato (c. 370 BC) has been the most enduring. From\nhis perspective, which extolled the application of focused\nintelligence and insight by those in power, insistence upon the use of\nlaw in government was \n\n\nlike a stubborn, stupid person who refuses to allow the slightest\ndeviation from or questioning of his own rules, even if the situation\nhas in fact changed and it turns out to be better for someone to\ncontravene these rules. (Statesman 294b\u2013c) \n\n\nRules themselves were part of the problem: \u201cPeople and\nsituations differ, and human affairs are characterized by an almost\npermanent state of instability\u201d (Statesman 294b). One would use them, only as a (distant) second-best, if one felt\none couldn\u2019t discern or trust the appearance of expertise in\npolitical life. These concerns are echoed in the work of modern legal\npragmatists (like Posner 1995) who place much more faith in insight of\njudges into new situations than in the application of established\nrules or strained analogies with ancient precedents. \n\nEchoes of the Platonic critique are also heard in those who privilege\ndecisive executive decision-making in times of crisis, especially if\nthe crises seem to be successive and unending (Schmitt 1923; Posner\nand Vermeule 2010). Someone\u2019s will has to prevail and, it is\nsaid, the Rule of Law does us no service by pretending that the\nelement of will can be eliminated from politics or that decisiveness\nmatters less than the \u201clong deliberation\u201d that was\nextolled in Aristotle's Rhetoric.\n\nThe sense of what good law-making and ordinary legal administration\nrequire conveyed by the principles of the Rule of Law is sometimes\ncriticized as archaic. Partisans of the Rule of Law often think in\nterms of clearly drafted and prospective measures promulgated as norms\nthat can stand in the name of the whole community and form a publicly\nacknowledged framework for their actions and transactions. But this is\nnot really how law operates in the modern world. As Rubin 1989 points\nout, a great deal of modern legislation consists simply of a\nframe-working statute authoring agencies to develop much more detailed\nrules which are conveyed to the public\u2014to the extent that is\nnecessary\u2014by modes of communication much more complex and\nnuanced than those envisaged in traditional models of the Rule of Law.\nFor example, the principles comprised in Fuller 1964\u2019s inner\nmorality of law\u2014see\n section 3.6\n above\u2014are recipes perhaps for the production of legislation\nthat looks congenial to legalistic concerns about clarity and\npredictability. But it has little or nothing to do with the way law\nactually operates or the way legislatures communicate with agencies\nand agencies in turn communicate with those whose actions and\nbusinesses they supervise (Rubin 1989: 397\u2013408).\n\nAt the same time, there are concerns about the mentality that is\nfostered by an excessive emphasis on the Rule of Law. In its most\nextreme form, the Rule of Law can have the effect of closing down the\nfaculty of independent moral thought in the officials (the judges, for\nexample: see Cover 1975) or in the ordinary members of a community,\nmaking them anxious in the face of uncertainty and distrustful of\ntheir own or others\u2019 individual judgments (see Henderson\n1990). Sometimes it is\nimportant, for the sake of clear and courageous moral judgment, not to\nexaggerate the importance of something being required by law. Other\nconcerns about the mentality fostered by the Rule of Law include\nconcerns about legalism and the tendency to over-formalize or\nover-bureaucratize relationships that are more healthily conceived in\nterms that are more informal. This is not just a matter of legalizing\nthe personal realm; it is also a matter of understanding, for example,\nthe damage that can be done to relations between officials (like\nsocial workers) and vulnerable clients by replacing bringing in rigid\nrules to replace relatively informal professional norms (Simon\n1983). \n",
