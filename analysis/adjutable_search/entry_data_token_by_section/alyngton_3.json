The Theory of Substance\n\nThese remarks on the relations between forms and substances bring us\nto the core of Alyngton\u2019s ontology: the doctrine of substance,\ndeveloped in the fifth chapter of his commentary on the\nCategories. Alyngton\u2019s treatment can be divided into\ntwo main parts. (i) The first attempts to clarify what characterizes\nsubstance, and therefore what falls by itself into that category; (ii)\nthe second is concerned with the distinction between primary (or\nindividual) and secondary (or universal) substances.\n\nAlyngton lists seven opinions about the nature and mode of being of\nsubstance, the last of which he supports.\n\nAccording to the first one, proper to grammarians, substance is\nwhat the term \u2018substance\u2019 refers to when utilized in a\nbroad sense, that is, the quiddity (quidditas) or essence\n(essentia) of anything. In this case, substance is not a\ncategory, since the items which fulfil this description do not share\nany common nature (In Cat., cap. de substantia, p.\n263).\nThe second opinion is that of Avicenna, who affirms that any\nentity which does not inhere in something else is a substance (cf.\nLiber de philosophia prima, tr. 8, cap. 4, S. Van Riet ed., 2\nvols., Louvain-Leiden: Peeters-Brill, 1977\u201380, vol. 2, pp.\n403\u2013404). According to this view, God, substantial differences,\nand negative truths can be said to be substances, even though only in\nan analogical way (In Cat., cap. de substantia, pp.\n263\u2013264).\nA third meaning of the term \u2018substance\u2019 can be drawn\nfrom the use (of that term) proper to common people and theologians:\neverything which plays the role of foundation (fundamentum)\nin relation to something else is a substance. In this sense, the\nsurface is the foundation (and therefore the substance) of the\nwhiteness (In Cat., cap. de substantia, p.\n264).\nThe fourth opinion seems to be the same as the anonymous one\ndiscussed and partially criticized by Burley in his last commentary on\nthe Categories (C.E. 1337, cap. de substantia, ed.\nVenetiis 1509, fol. 22rb\u2013va). Substance would be (i) a positive\nbeing, which (ii) does not inhere in something else, and (iii) is\nnaturally apt to play the role of subject in relation to absolute\naccidents (that is, quantities and qualities). According to this view,\nmatter, form, the composite made up of matter and form, and the\nangelic intelligences are substances, whereas substantial differences\nand negative truths are not, since the former do not satisfy the third\nrequisite, nor the latter the first one (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, p. 264).\nThe fifth opinion is that of Boethius (cf. In Categorias\nAristotelis libri quattuor, PL, vol. 64, 184A\u2013B), according\nto whom substance is (i) a positive being, which (ii) does not inhere\nin something else, and (iii) is a compound of matter and form (In\nCat., cap. de substantia, p. 264).\nThe sixth opinion is that of Burley (cf. Expositio super\nPraedicamenta Aristotelis, cap. de substantia, fol.\n24ra.), to whom Alyngton refers by the expression \u2018moderni\nlogici\u2019. According to Burley, (i) not being in a subject,\n(ii) having an essence, (iii) autonomy and independent existence, and\n(iv) the capacity of underlying accidental forms are the main aspect\nof substances. This means that primary substances alone are substances\nproperly speaking, while matter and form, and substantial differences\nare not (In Cat., cap. de substantia, p. 265).\nThe last opinion is that of Wyclif (cf. De ente\npraedicamentali, cap. 5, pp. 36\u201339), quoted extensively and\nalmost verbatim. Alyngton claims that it is superior to the preceding\nones (septima est expositio metaphysica et altior ad intelligendum\nquam praenominatae). According to this view, the constitutive\nprinciple of the substance is not the capacity of underlying absolute\naccidents, but it is the capacity of underlying potency and act, which\nare its inner foundations\u2014the capacity of underlying accidents\nbeing only a derivative property (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, p. 267).\n\n\nWyclif\u2019s position about the nature of substance implies that the\ndistinction between potency and act is, from the point of view of\nmetaphysics, the most fundamental distinction, of which that between\nform and matter is but one example. As (i) prime matter is pure\npotentiality, while form is act, and (ii) the distinction between\npotency and act is wider than that between matter and form, the latter\nis a particular case of the former. In fact, according to Wyclif, the\ndistinction between potency and act runs though the whole of creation,\nsince it applies also to any kinds of spiritual creatures, whereas the\ndistinction between matter and form is found only in the corporeal\ncreatures. On the contrary, Alyngton seems to interpret the\ndistinction between potency and act as a particular case of the\ndistinction between matter and form, since he constantly explains the\nmeaning of the opposition potency-act in terms of the opposition\nbetween matter and form in a crucial passage that he quotes from\nWyclif\u2019s De ente praedicamentali (In Cat.,\ncap. de substantia, p. 267 [= Wyclif, De ente\npraedicamentali, cap. 5, pp. 38\u201339]). The result is a sort\nof universal hylemorphism, since in this way matter and form serve as\nprinciples in the order of being as well as in the order of becoming.\nAll the more so because Alyngton seems to accept the thesis that\n(angelic) intelligences are not pure forms existing by themselves, but\nformal principles necessarily joined to the matter of the heavens in\nsuch a way as to make up living beings (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, p. 264).\n\nA second consequence of this approach to the problem of the nature of\nsubstance is that, within his system, primary substances alone are\nsubstances properly speaking. This conclusion is confirmed by his\nanalysis of the distinctive mark (proprium) of substance:\nwhile remaining numerically one and the same, being capable of\nadmitting contrary properties, the modification taking place through a\nchange in the subject itself of the motion at issue. Alyngton appears\nto think that this description is satisfied only by primary (that is,\nindividual) substances (In Cat., cap. de substantia,\nfol. 104v). Secondary substances therefore are per se in the\ncategory of substance only insofar as they are constitutive parts of\nprimary substances. Thus, secondary substances belong to the category\nof substance by virtue of the individual substances that instantiate\nthem, since they are not formally substances. In fact, unlike primary\nsubstances, secondary substances are forms, and consequently\nincomplete entities with an imperfect and dependent mode of existence.\nThey require composite substances in order to properly exist. No form\nas such, not even the substantial ones, is formally a substance, since\nno form as such has (i) the capacity of underlying potency and act,\nand (ii) matter and form as its inner constituent. Secondary\nsubstances are related to primary substances as formal principles of\nthe latter. It is in this way that humanity and (say) Socrates are\nlinked together. For this reason no secondary substances as such are\ntotally identical with primary substances (In Cat., cap.\nde substantia, p. 280; see also pp. 281 and 282\u2013283).\nAs a consequence, while \u2018man is animal\u2019 (\u2018homo\nest animal\u2019) is a sentence to which a formal predication\ncorresponds in the world, a predication by essence matches\n\u2018humanity is animality\u2019 (\u2018humanitas est\nanimalitas\u2019). Any (individual) man is an animal because of\nthe form of humanity present in him qua its essential\nconstituent, albeit the form of humanity as such is not the principle\nof animality. Therefore, humanity is not formally animality nor\nrationality, even though it is animality plus rationality (In\nCat., cap. de substantia, pp. 283\u2013284; see also\ncap. de quantitate, fols. 106v\u2013107r).\n\nPrimary substances are the substrate of existence of any other kinds\nof categorial being, as nothing exists in addition to primary\nsubstances but secondary substances and accidents, which both are\nforms present in individual substances. Like Aristotle\n(Categories 5, 2b5\u20136), Alyngton can therefore affirm\nthat primary substances are the necessary condition of existence for\nany other items of the world: nothing could exist, if primary\nsubstances stopped existing (In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, p. 286). This does not mean, however, that it would\nbe possible to find in the world a primary substance (i) that would\nnot belong to a certain species, and (ii) without any accident\ninhering in it. It means that, from the point of view of full\nexistence, accidents and secondary substances always presuppose\nprimary substances, as to be a primary substance is to be an\nautonomous singular existing item (hoc aliquid), whilst (i)\nto be a secondary substance is to be a quale quid, that is,\nan inner and essential determination (or form) of a primary substance,\nand (ii) to be an accident is to be an outer determination or aspect\nof a primary substance (In Cat., cap. de substantia,\nfol. 101v).\n",
