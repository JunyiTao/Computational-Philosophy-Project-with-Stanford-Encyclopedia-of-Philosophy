    "main_text": "The Psychology of Moral Development\n4. The Psychology of Moral Development\n\n\nWhat remains to be explained is how the moral consciousness arises,\nand Bradley\u2019s account, not surprisingly, depends on the fact that\nchildren are raised in a social environment and will learn by\nexperience. At an early stage of mental life the child will experience\npleasure from some object\u2014say an apple\u2014and transfers the\npleasant sensation to the object, so that it becomes part of the\ncontent of the apple, a part of what that object means to the child,\nor, better, a part of what the child sees in that object. The child\ngenerates an appetite for objects of this sort and in the presence of\nan apple the child will have a mixed reaction: a pleasant feeling\nbecause the object is seen as pleasant, but a painful feeling because\nshe is not in possession of, or enjoying, the apple. This produces a\nfelt tension\u2014\u201cfelt\u201d because it is occurring at a\npre-cognitive level, before the child has beliefs about the object is\nor able to make inferences about the object based on past\nexperience. This felt tension is desire and it moves the child to\naction, to try to take physical possession of it. Bradley\u2019s\npsychological account differs from the hedonist\u2019s in that whereas\nhedonism holds that a particular pleasure is willed, Bradley claims\nthat the ideal object willed is a particular thing which has had a\npleasant quality transferred to it and thereby attributed to the thing\nitself. Moreover, on Bradley\u2019s account the will\u2014once we get to\nthe stage of having a fully developed self capable of having a\nwill\u2014is actually seeking the object willed because it represents\nthe satisfaction of the self following the process of\nidentification. However, at this stage we have at best a very\nprimitive precursor of the self and it can only be said to affirm\nitself. That is, it lacks the developed consciousness necessary to\nrepresenting ideal objects. Moreover, the child at this stage lacks\nthe higher-order consciousness needed to see itself as realizing\nitself by attaining an ideal object with which it has identified its\nsatisfaction. It only \u201caffirms\u201d itself in that it puts its\nwill into the world as its appetites and desires respond to sensible\nobjects and in this its unarticulated objective is to possess the\nthing it desires. At this early stage the child desires the object\nonly when it is present; at a later stage the child will gain a sense\nof these things as independent external objects that persist,\nceteris paribus, and so can be desired in their\nabsence.\n\n\nThe child also experiences other people and is eventually going to\nrecognize them as individuals with independent wills\u2014i.e., as\nothers who have their own plans and projects and as selves attempting\nto realize themselves through their actions, and who, because of these\nfacts, may oppose or confirm its own desires, oppose its will. Since\ninitially these others are going to be family members or care-givers\nthere will be a pre-conscious bond of affection between them and the\nchild. When the child acts in accord with the will of another,\npleasure results from the affirmation from that other person, while\nopposition is experienced as painful because it negates the bond of\naffection. This produces the felt tension similar to that which occurs\nin the case of an inaccessible desired object: a tension between the\npleasure associated with the presence of the care-giver and the pain\nof being without the approval of that person. The main point here is\nthat the child will tend to be good (i.e., fit in with the norms and\nexpectations of the caregivers) solely because not doing so is\npainful, not because the child has, at this stage, any goal it is\ntrying to achieve by being good, nor even the ability to articulate\nwhy it acts as it does. As Bradley says, \u201cThe child is taught to\nwill a content which is universal and good, and he learns to identify\nhis will with it, so that he feels pleasure when he feels himself in\naccord with it, uneasiness or pain when his will is contrary thereto,\nand he feels that it is contrary. This is the beginning of personal\nmorality\u201d (Ethical Studies, p. 178).\n\nAs the child develops it learns the language of morality and thereby\nthe moral perspective embedded in it. In this process the child\nlearns the meaning of normative concepts and in doing so learns what\nthey mean to others in the shared linguistic community. In this\nway the social community imparts a moral perspective. In fact,\nthe community introduces the child to two levels of moral\nreflection: it imparts specific moral values and norms through\nits institutions and practices, and; it provides the moral concepts\nthat are necessary to the task of conceiving of ways to improve\nsociety, in this way making possible the move to the more comprehensive\nlevel of Ideal Morality.\n\nThe above rehearsal glosses over several identifiable stages of moral\ndevelopment set out in Bradley\u2019s moral psychology. These\ndetails can be ignored here, for the important point to note is that\nBradley attempts to supple a psychological account of moral development\nthat fills in the final part of his exposition of the theory of\nself-realization by explaining how one comes to identify one\u2019s\nsatisfaction with the achieving or realizing of particular moral\nends. It is also important to note the roles he assigns to\npleasure and pain. That these have a place in his moral theory\nindicates that the ethical hedonists were not totally wrong about their\nimportance, their mistake being to think that promoting pleasure and\ndiminishing pain marks the ultimate goal of moral\nactivity. By contrast, Bradley argues that in acting\nmorally we choose and will and act in terms of the idea of a state of\naffairs which represents a superior self to be realized. We feel\npleasure at the thought of that self with which we have identified\nbecause we feel affirmed by the thought of its realization. We\nfeel pain at the felt contradiction between this and our actual self\nand pain at the thought of not being the superior self we desire.\n",
