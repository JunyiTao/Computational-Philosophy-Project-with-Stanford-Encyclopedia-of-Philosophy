    "main_text": "Arnauld and Malebranche || Does God act only by general volitions?\n4.3 Does God act only by general volitions?\n\nArnauld devoted much of R\u00e9flexions to\nMalebranche\u2019s position that God acts by general volitions and\nnot by particular volitions. In Book I of R\u00e9flexions,\nhis focus is on the order of nature and he tries to show that\nMalebranche\u2019s claim that God acts only by general volitions is\nconfused and even self-contradictory. In Book II, his focus is on the\norder of grace and he attacks Malebranche\u2019s claim that God does\nnot distribute grace by particular volitions.\n\nArnauld begins his criticism in Book I by claiming that Malebranche\nconfuses acting by general volitions and acting according\nto general laws. Arnauld grants that God acts according to\ngeneral laws. But against the claim that God acts by general\nvolitions, he provides an argument that is simple, and, his view,\ndecisive:\n\nWhatever [God] does, He does in particular, and not in general. But\nsince to will and to do, in God, are the same thing, given\nthat He creates each soul by a particular action, He must also will to\ncreate it by a particular will. (OA, 39:175)\n\n\nIn some passages, Malebranche\u2019s language suggests that\nGod\u2019s wisdom dictates that He engage in the act of creating that\nbest combines the goodness of the world created with the simplicity of\nthe laws according to which the world is created, and not\nwith simplicity of the volition whereby God creates\n(TNG, OM, 5:147). This suggests that for Malebranche\nGod does will particular created effects, though He wills that they\ntake place according to certain laws. But Arnauld did not think that\nthis was Malebranche\u2019s view. For suppose that God creates the\nworld according to a simple set of laws. Let these laws, as regards\nbodies, be the laws of motion. A world created according to such laws\nmight be more perfect than a world not created according to general\nlaws, or created according to a different set of laws. But that would\nbe of no help to Malebranche. For he does not say that a world\nregulated by simpler laws is a more perfect world. Rather he maintains\nthat creating such a world is a simpler act of creation in God\nHimself. But it is not at all clear how simplicity of laws according\nto which the world is created would make God\u2019s way of creating\nsimpler, especially if God\u2019s creative activity includes the will\nto create every particular part of the creative world.\nMalebranche\u2019s real position, according to Arnauld, emerges in\nthose passages in which he identifies the \u201cways\u201d in which\nthe word is created with the actions whereby God creates. An example\nis the passage, \u201cAn excellent workman ought to proportion his\naction to his work; he does not accomplish by highly complex ways\n(voyes) what He can execute by simpler ones\u201d (TNG,\nOM, 5:28). To this Arnauld objects that the volitions by which\nGod creates are particular.\n\nArnauld next points out that Malebranche does not say, without\nqualification, that God creates by general volitions. Rather,\nMalebranche says that God\u2019s creative will is\n\nthe cause of a particular effect; but he calls it general, because he\nholds that God has this will only when He is determined to have it by\nan occasional cause, which must be a creature. (OA, 39:176).\n\n\nIn other words, according to Malebranche, God causes particular\neffects in creation, but the contribution of God\u2019s volition, as\nopposed to the contribution of created occasional causes, is general.\nLater on, Arnauld says that, on Malebranche\u2019s view, it is really\nonly the free volitions of creatures that can be said to determine\nGod, in view of His general volitions, to produce a particular effect.\nFor, according to Malebranche, God is the cause of every bodily event,\nincluding those which, together with the general laws, are supposed to\ndetermine any given consequent event. (OA, 39:230). But\nMalebranche is committed, so Arnauld argues, to the position that the\nfree volitions of creatures are not caused by God (OA,\n 39:248\u201357).[27]\n\nArnauld goes farther and says that Malebranche\u2019s position on\nGod\u2019s creative will is, in fact, self-contradictory. For\nMalebranche\n\nwas not of the opinion of those philosophers who believe that God\noriginally created all things, gave them the qualities necessary for\ntheir conservation and the powers they needed in order to act, and\nthen left them to act without further involving Himself.\n\n\nOn the contrary, Malebranche insists that \u201cGod is the sole cause\nof everything in the world, up to the smallest movement of the\nsmallest atom.\u201d But he also holds that God \u201cacts in the\nworld only as a universal cause, whose general volitions are\ndetermined by the \u2026 changes \u2026 in creatures, as by so\nmany occasional causes.\u201d Arnauld tries to show that these two\npositions are inconsistent with one another (OA,\n39:231\u201337).\n\nNear the end of Book II of R\u00e9flexions, Arnauld takes\nup Malebranche\u2019s arguments for the claim, \u201cGod does not\nact, in the order of grace, by particular volitions,\u201d as\nsummarized by Malebranche in the Premier Eclaircissement to\nTNG (OA, 39:621). Malebranche says that the\nproposition in question can be proved by reason \u201cin two ways;\n\u00e0 priori & \u00e0 posteriori; that is, by our\nidea of God, and by the effects of grace.\u201d The chief \u201ca\npriori\u201d argument involves the claim that \u201cto choose\noccasional causes, and to establish general laws for carrying out some\nwork, indicates an infinitely more extensive knowledge than to act by\nparticular volitions.\u201d Arnauld retorts, \u201cIs it something\nto be put up with, that human beings \u2026 should have the temerity\nto make themselves judges of what is a sign in God of greater\nintelligence and wisdom?\u201d (OA, 39:624).\n\nArnauld quotes Malebranche\u2019s statement, \u201cThe \u00e0\npriori proofs are too abstract to convince most people of the\ntruth I am proposing. It is more \u00e0 propos to prove it\n\u00e0 posteriori,\u201d and goes on to consider the a\nposteriori arguments (OA, 39:625\u201343). He is less\nsarcastic in dealing with these arguments than with the a priori ones.\nHe says that there are \u201cthree or four of them, but they all\namount to the same thing: There are graces that are inefficacious, and\nthis would not occur if God gave His graces by particular\nvolitions.\u201d He mentions three such arguments, based on the\npremise that graces are given to sinners who are not entirely\nconverted; on the premise that grace often falls upon hearts disposed\nin such a way that the grace does not bear fruit; and, finally, on the\npremise that graces given to sinners sometimes end up making them even\nmore guilty.\n\nArnauld assumes that these arguments have to do with \u201cthe true\ngrace of Jesus Christ, as defined by St. Augustine: Inspiratio\ndilectionis, ut cognita sancto amore faciamus, an inspiration of\nlove given to us so that we should do the good with holy\naffection.\u201d Such grace is efficacious if it infallibly has its\neffect. But the effect in question may be either proximate\n(prochain) or remote (\u00e9loign\u00e9). As in\nthe famous example of Augustine, a grace may be efficacious in that it\nproduces the desire to be chaste, and yet not efficacious in that it\nfails to produces chastity itself. Similarly, Malebranche\u2019s\narguments assume that \u201cEvery grace has the effect for which God\ngives it.\u201d But once again, this phrase may refer to the effect\nfor which God gives the grace by His absolute will, or to the effect\nthat grace tends to produce by its nature and for which God gives the\ngrace by His antecedent will. Arnauld grants that if God gives\nefficacious graces by particular volitions, then there are none that\nfail to have the proximate effect, which God intends they have by His\nabsolute will. But they may well fail to have remote effects to which\nthey tend by their nature and which God wills only by His antecedent\nwill. For example, if an efficacious grace has the effect that a\nsinner repents, only to lapse back into sin, then the grace had the\nproximate effect God intended it to have by His absolute will, even\nthough it failed to have all the effect to which it tended by its\nnature and which God willed by His antecedent will. In this way, he\ndisposes of Malebranche\u2019s three a posteriori arguments.\n\nArnauld ends Book II with a consideration of what he takes to be\nMalebranche\u2019s master argument. It is a fourth a posteriori\nargument. He quotes from the Troisi\u00e8me\nEclaircissement:\n\nThere is no other way than [by saying that God does not act by\nparticular volitions] to reconcile the proposition in Holy Scripture,\n\u2018God wants to save all men,\u2019 with this proposition,\n\u2018Not all men are saved\u2019. (OA, 39:637)\n\n\nArnauld rejects this argument mainly because, like the other three a\nposteriori ones, it assumes that \u201cGod wills, by a true volition,\nthe salvation of all men, and the conversion of sinners\u201d\n(OA, 39:641).\n\nArnauld agreed with Malebranche that God could have brought it about\nthat all men are saved and did not do so. But he favored an\nAugustinian view that \u201call men\u201d in this context means\n\u201call sorts of men,\u201d that is, men of all races,\noccupations, etc. He did not entirely reject the Thomistic view that\nGod\u2019s will for the salvation of all men is God\u2019s\n\u201cantecedent will\u201d rather than His \u201cconsequent\nwill,\u201d that is, God\u2019s will other things being equal rather\nthan God\u2019s will all things considered. Arnauld points out that\nMalebranche\u2019s position might be thought to be a version of the\nThomistic one, but adds that according to St. Thomas God\u2019s\nantecedent will is a wish rather than an absolute volition (une\nvelleit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une volont\u00e9 absolue)\n(R\u00e9flexions, OA, 39:198, cf.\n 39:576).[28]\n Arnauld firmly rejects any notion that God wills the sanctification\nand salvation of each and every person in a strong sense of\n\u201cwill\u201d such that His will would be carried out unless\nthere were something to prevent it, or, in Malebranche\u2019s words,\nto hold it in\n check.[29]\n",
