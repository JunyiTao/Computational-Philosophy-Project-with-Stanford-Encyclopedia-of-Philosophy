    "main_text": "Historical development of Hilbert\u2019s Program || Early work on foundations\n1.1 Early work on foundations\n\nHilbert\u2019s work on the foundations of mathematics has its roots\nin his work on geometry of the 1890s, culminating in his influential\ntextbook Foundations of Geometry\n (1899)\n (see\n 19th Century Geometry).  Hilbert\nbelieved that the proper way to develop any scientific subject\nrigorously required an axiomatic approach. In providing an axiomatic\ntreatment, the theory would be developed independently of any need for\nintuition, and it would facilitate an analysis of the logical\nrelationships between the basic concepts and the axioms.  For Hilbert,\nthe investigation of the independence and, above all, consistency of\nthe axioms is of basic importance for an axiomatic treatment.  For the\naxioms of geometry, consistency can be proved by providing an\ninterpretation of the system in the real plane, and thus, the\nconsistency of geometry is reduced to the consistency of analysis. The\nfoundation of analysis, of course, itself requires an axiomatization\nand a consistency proof. Hilbert provided such an axiomatization in\n(1900b), but it became clear very quickly\nthat the consistency of analysis faced significant difficulties, in\nparticular because the favored way of providing a foundation for\nanalysis in Dedekind\u2019s work relied on dubious assumptions akin\nto to those that lead to the paradoxes of set theory and\n Russell\u2019s Paradox\n in Frege\u2019s foundation of arithmetic.\n\nHilbert thus realized that a direct consistency proof of\nanalysis, i.e., one not based on reduction to another theory, was\nneeded. He proposed the problem of finding such a proof as the second\nof his 23 mathematical problems in his address to the International\nCongress of Mathematicians in 1900\n (1900a)\n and presented a sketch of such a proof in his Heidelberg talk\n (1905).\n Several factors delayed the further development of Hilbert\u2019s\nfoundational program. One was perhaps the criticism of\n Poincar\u00e9 (1906)\n against what he saw as a viciously circular use of induction in\nHilbert\u2019s sketched consistency proof (see\n Steiner 1975,\n Appendix). Hilbert also realized that axiomatic investigations\nrequired a well worked-out logical formalism. At the time he relied on\na conception of logic based on the algebraic tradition, in particular,\non Schr\u00f6der\u2019s work, which was not particularly suited as a\nformalism for the axiomatization of mathematics.
