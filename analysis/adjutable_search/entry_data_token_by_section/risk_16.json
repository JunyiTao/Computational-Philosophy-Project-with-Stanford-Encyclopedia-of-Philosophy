    "main_text": "Risk in economic analysis || Experimental economics\n7.3 Experimental economics\n\nStudies in experimental economics reveal that actual agents often do\nnot conform with theoretically derived rationality criteria. One of\nthe most popular descriptive theories that tries to capture actual\nbehaviour under risk is prospect theory, which was developed by Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky around 1980 (Kahneman & Tversky 1979;\nTversky & Kahneman 1986). It distinguishes between two stages in a\ndecision process. In the first phase, the editing phase,\ngains and losses in the different options are identified. They are\ndefined relative to some neutral reference point that is usually the\ncurrent asset position. In the second phase, the evaluation\nphase, the options are evaluated in a way that resembles expected\nutility analysis, but both utilities and probabilities are replaced by\nother, similar measures. Utility is replaced by a measure that is\nasymmetrical between gains and losses. Objective probabilities are\ntransformed by a function that gives more weight to probability\ndifferences close to the ends than to those near the centre of the\ndistribution. Thus it makes a greater difference to decrease the\nprobability of a negative outcome from 2 to 1 per cent than to\ndecrease it from 51 to 50 percent. \n\nProspect theory can explain some of the ways in which actual behaviour\ndeviates from standard economic models of rational behaviour under\nrisk. Hence the overweighting of probability changes close to zero or\nunity can be used to explain why people both buy insurance and buy\nlottery tickets. However, prospect theory is not plausible as a\nnormative theory for rational behaviour under risk. Probably,\nnormative and descriptive theories of risk will have to go in\ndifferent directions.\n",
