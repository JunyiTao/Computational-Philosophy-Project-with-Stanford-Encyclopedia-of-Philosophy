    "main_text": "Historical Development\n1. Historical Development\n\nEvolutionary game theory was first developed by R. A. Fisher [see\nThe Genetic Theory of Natural Selection (1930)] in his\nattempt to explain the approximate equality of the sex ratio in\nmammals. The puzzle Fisher faced was this: why is it that the sex\nratio is approximately equal in many species where the majority of\nmales never mate? (See, for example, the Northern elephant seal\nMirounga angustirostris.) In these species, the non-mating\nmales would seem to be excess baggage carried around by the rest of\nthe population, having no real use. Fisher realized that if we measure\nindividual fitness in terms of the expected number of\ngrandchildren, then individual fitness depends on the\ndistribution of males and females in the population. When there is a\ngreater number of females in the population, males have a higher\nindividual fitness; when there are more males in the population,\nfemales have a higher individual fitness. Fisher pointed out that, in\nsuch a situation, the evolutionary dynamics lead to the sex ratio\nbecoming fixed at equal numbers of males and females. The fact that\nindividual fitness depends upon the relative frequency of males and\nfemales in the population introduces a strategic element to\nevolution.\n\nFisher\u2019s argument can be understood game theoretically, but he\ndid not state it in those terms. In 1961, R.\u00a0C. Lewontin made the\nfirst explicit application of\n game theory\n to evolutionary biology in \u201cEvolution and the Theory of\nGames\u201d (not to be confused with the Maynard Smith work of the\nsame name). In 1972, Maynard Smith first introduced the concept of an\nevolutionarily stable strategy (hereafter ESS) in the chapter\n\u201cGame Theory and the Evolution of Fighting.\u201d However, it\nwas the publication of \u201cThe Logic of Animal Conflict,\u201d by\nMaynard Smith and Price in 1973 that introduced the concept of an ESS\ninto widespread circulation. In 1982, Maynard Smith\u2019s seminal\ntext Evolution and the Theory of Games appeared, followed\nshortly thereafter by Robert Axelrod\u2019s famous work The\nEvolution of Cooperation in 1984. Since then, there has been a\nveritable explosion of interest by economists and social scientists in\nevolutionary game theory (see the bibliography below).\n\nInitially, it was thought that evolutionary game theory might provide\nan inroad into solving the equilibrium selection problem of\ntraditional game theory. Although the fundamental solution concept of\ntraditional game theory, the Nash equilibrium, had the\ndesirable property of always existing for any game with a finite\nnumber of players and strategies, provided that mixed strategies were\nallowed, it had several deficencies. A Nash equilibrium was not\nguaranteed to be unique (sometimes even with uncountable many Nash\nequilibria existing), did not always seem to correspond to a\nreasonable outcome (see Hargreaves Heap and Varoufakis, 2004), and\noccasionally conflicted with people\u2019s intuitions as to what ought to\ncount as a rational outcome. In contrast, it could be shown\nthat a completely mixed evolutionarily stable strategy was unique,\nthat there were at most only a finite number of evolutionarily stable\nstrategies, and that several intuitive definitions of evolutionarily\nstability were equivalent to the original definition of Maynard Smith\nand Price.\n\nIt was soon realised that evolutionary game theory itself had problems\nstructurally similar to that of the equilibrium selection problem.\nSeveral competing definitions of evolutionary stability were put\nforward, each of which had certain intuitive merit. In addition, as\nthe connection between the static and dynamic\napproaches to evolutionary game theory were explored in detail, it was\nfound that there was, at best, an imperfect fit between static\nconcepts of evolutionary stability and that of dynamic stability.\nFurthermore, dynamical models of evolutionary game theory led to\noutcomes which were expressely irrational from the point of\nview of traditional game theory, such as the preservation of\nstrictly dominated strategies.\n",
