    "main_text": "Contemporary philosophical accounts of coercion || Moralized vs. non-moralized baselines\n2.3 Moralized vs. non-moralized baselines\n\nNozick explains the idea of the baseline by calling it the\n\u201cnormal or natural or expected course of events\u201d (Nozick\n1969, 447). But all of these terms are ambiguous, in that they have\nnormative (or \u201cmoral\u201d) and non-normative (e.g.,\n\u201cpredictive\u201d) uses. Frequently, the normative and\npredictive uses will point to the same state of affairs as the course\nof events that is indicated. However, the extensions of the normative\nand non-normative uses will sometimes differ, thus requiring a\ntheorist to choose one or the other in order to determine whether a\nparticular communication counts as a threat or an offer, and is\ntherefore coercive or not.\n\nNozick offers two of the best known cases in which the normative and\nnon-normative baselines would appear to diverge. Here\u2019s one of\nthem (Nozick 1969,\n 450\u201351):[10]\n\nThe slave case:\n\nP is a slave owner who regularly beats his slave Q.\nOne day P proposes to spare Q his regular beating if\nand only if Q now does A.\n\n\nQ prefers not to be beaten, so we look to the conditional\n\n(e) If Q does not do A, P will beat\nQ.\n\n\nSince P beats Q regularly, this conditional\u2019s\nbecoming operative makes Q no worse off than what Q\nfinds normal or expected (statistically speaking). So\nP\u2019s proposal amounts to an offer, not a threat, on this\nway of understanding of what\u2019s normal. Yet we would reasonably\nhold that if Q elects to escape a beating by doing\nA, Q\u2019s choice is made in response to a threat\nof a beating, and is thus coerced.\n\nThe slave case demonstrates an ambiguity in our thought about\n\u201cwhat is normal\u201d (or \u201cwhat is expected\u201d).\nAlthough the slave is typically beaten and predicts he\u2019ll be\nbeaten based on past history, we expect on moral grounds that people\nare not beaten for no reason. Given the moral sense of what is normal,\nthe slave owner\u2019s proposition amounts to a threat, thus\nvalidating our sense that the slave is coerced into doing A.\nEspecially in contexts of entrenched injustice, the\n\u201cmoral\u201d and \u201cpredictive\u201d baselines may\ndiverge, forcing us to choose between them.\n\nActually, any number of different possible baselines might be\nconstructed for judging whether a proposal makes one better or worse\noff than the baseline. There are different ways of making a\nprediction; there are different \u201cmoral\u201d standards; there\nare also ways of taking into consideration what the recipient of the\nproposal would want. So divergences among the many possible baselines\nmay be more common than we might at first suspect. This requires us to\nfind a way to choose among the possibly diverging baselines. Nozick,\nfor instance, proposes that when the \u201cpredictive\u201d and the\n\u201cmoral\u201d baselines diverge, we turn to the preferences of\nthe recipient of the proposal, and use the baseline he prefers. In the\nslave case above, Nozick reasonably supposes that the slave would\nprefer that \u201cnormal\u201d meant \u201cmoral\u201d; in which\ncase the slave would not be beaten even if he did not do A.\nBy comparison to this baseline, the slave-owner\u2019s proposal is a\nthreat, not an offer.\n\nSome theorists have noticed that what the proposal recipient wants to\nhappen may differ from both the moral and predictive baselines.\nMichael Gorr, for instance, argues that if preferences are important\nwhen the baselines diverge, \u201cit is unclear why they should be\nless so in cases where the two baselines coincide.\u201d Hence he\nfavors an account that \u201cmakes the subject\u2019s preferences a\ncontrolling factor in all cases\u201d (Gorr 1986,\n398\u2013399; see also Rhodes 2000). The difficulty with this\nsuggestion, however, is that it\u2019s very difficult to craft\nconstraints on what preferences will count for how things go; people\ncan want others to do or omit doing almost anything. Suppose we agree\nit is normal in both the moral and predictive senses for workers who\nshirk to be fired, and for customers who refuse to pay utility bills\nto have their electricity cut off. Of course, workers and customers\nwould likely prefer to get paid for nothing, and to get their\nelectricity for free. Compared to these baselines, proposing to fire\nor to cut off electricity to someone amounts to going out of\none\u2019s way to attach undesirable consequences to some\n(non\u2011)action A. On Gorr\u2019s criteria, it would\nappear, both of these threats count as coercive threats, yet both seem\nto be parts of ordinary, non-coercive commerce based on offers and\n acceptances.[11]\n At any rate, it is difficult to see how a fully preference-based\nbaseline account can avoid seeing coercion in a vast array of\nsituations where our pre-theoretic views would deny it.\n\nThose who opt for a moralized baseline approach seem to offer a more\nplausible approach. The most prominent of these theorists has been\nAlan Wertheimer, whose book Coercion sets the current\nstandard and starting point for continued scholarship in this\n area.[12]\n Since only threats coerce, but not all threats do, he provides a\ntwo-pronged test for whether a proposal constitutes a coercive threat\n(Wertheimer 1987, especially chs. 2, 12, and 14). The proposal\nconstitutes a threat if the proposer indicates that, if his\ndemand is denied, he will make the recipient worse off than the\nrecipient ought to be. (In particular, Wertheimer believes that this\nis frequently best understood as a question of whether the proposer\nproposes to violate the recipient\u2019s rights (Wertheimer\n1987,\n 217).)[13]\n Yet the mere fact that something threatens one is not sufficient to\nground a claim that it coerces anyone; the threat may be wrongful but\nalso trivial. So Wertheimer requires that the choice forced upon the\ncoercee be such that she has no reasonable choice but to succumb. This\ntoo requires a contextually specific, moralized judgment, Wertheimer\nthinks. One might, for instance, be supported in a claim that a\nthreatened beating left one \u201cno choice\u201d but to sign a\ncontract; the same might not be said about a choice to commit\nmurder.\n\nWertheimer\u2019s approach is developed and defended by surveying\nlegal reasoning in the U.S. and its common-law tradition with respect\nto such matters as contracts, criminal responsibility, plea bargains,\nblackmail, and consent to searches and medical procedures. His work\nhas been influential among many who have tried to determine what the\nlaw should say about various coercive phenomena, and Wertheimer\nhimself has offered further applications of his theories in subsequent\nwork, including a book on consent to sexual relations (Wertheimer\n2004). Wertheimer\u2019s moralized account and moralized theories of\ncoercion more generally raise some difficulties for understanding how\nthere could be \u201cjustified coercion,\u201d such as law\nenforcement, in that they tend to associate uses of coercion with\nimmoral action. Some of these difficulties are considered in Section\n3.4 below.\n",
