Neorealism\n\nIn spite of its ambiguities and weaknesses, Morgenthau\u2019s\nPolitics among Nations became a standard textbook and\ninfluenced thinking about international politics for a generation or\nso. At the same time, there was an attempt to develop a more\nmethodologically rigorous approach to theorizing about international\naffairs. In the 1950s and 1960s a large influx of scientists from\ndifferent fields entered the discipline of International Relations and\nattempted to replace the \u201cwisdom literature\u201d of classical\nrealists with scientific concepts and reasoning (Brown 35). This in\nturn provoked a counterattack by Morgenthau and scholars associated\nwith the so-called English School, especially Hedley Bull, who\ndefended a traditional approach (Bull 1966).\n\nAs a result, the discipline of international relations has been\ndivided into two main strands: traditional or non-positivist and\nscientific or positivist (neo-positivist). At a later stage the third\nstrand: post-positivism has been added. The traditionalists raise\nnormative questions and engage with history, philosophy and law. The\nscientists or positivists stress a descriptive and explanatory form of\ninquiry, rather than a normative one. They have established a strong\npresence in the field. Already by the mid-1960s, the majority of\nAmerican students in international relations were trained in\nquantitative research, game theory, and other new research techniques\nof the social sciences. This, along with the changing international\nenvironment, had a significant effect on the discipline. \n\nNotwithstanding their methodological differences, realists\u2019\nassumption is that the state is the key actor in international\npolitics, and that competitive and conflictual relations among states\nare the core of actual international relations. However, with the\nreceding of the Cold War during the 1970s, one could witness the\ngrowing importance of other actors: international and non-governmental\norganizations, as well as of multinational corporations. This\ndevelopment led to a revival of idealist thinking, which became known\nas neoliberalism or pluralism. While accepting some basic assumptions\nof realism, the leading pluralists, Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye,\nhave proposed the concept of complex interdependence to\ndescribe this more sophisticated picture of global politics. They\nwould argue that states could effectively cooperate with each other\nfor mutual benefit and there can be progress in international\nrelations, and that the future does not need to look like the\npast.\n",
