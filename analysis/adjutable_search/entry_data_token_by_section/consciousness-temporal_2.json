    "main_text": "Three Models of Temporal Consciousness || Dynamics of Consciousness\n1.3 Dynamics of Consciousness\n\nThere is a further issue which divides realists. In addition to\nespousing different views as to the structures within consciousness\nwhich provide us with temporal experiences, realists also defend a\nrange of different views concerning the character of temporal\nexperience. Think of what it is like to see ripples move across the\nsurface of a pond (or across one\u2019s skin), or an ocean wave\ncrashing on the beach, or the sound of a violin droning on. When we\ncarefully introspect, it becomes apparent that such experiences\npossess an internal dynamic character, an immanent intrinsic directed\nflow, of a distinctive kind. Since introspection also reveals\nthat inner experiences such as mental imagery and bodily sensations\nall possess a flow-like character, there is reason to think this\nspecial form of dynamism is a feature of all forms of temporal\nexperience. Or so some realists urge. Other realists are more\nsceptical in this regard, and deny that experience is distinctively\ndynamic in this sort of way, even if it is dynamic in other ways. We\nthus have a further division to note:\n\nStrong dynamism: some or all forms of consciousness\nare imbued with an intrinsic directional flow-character.\n\nModerate dynamism: we directly experience change,\nsuccession and persistence but our experience does not\npossess the inherent flow-character posited by strong dynamists.\n\nBergson held that consciousness (or dur\u00e9e) is strongly\ndynamic\u2014\u201ccontinual flow \u2026 is the only immediate\ndate of consciousness\u201d (Bergson 1889 [1910: 44]). He took this\ndynamism to be a primitive or irreducible feature of experience,\ndescribing the experience of a shooting star as \u201ca line of\nfire\u201d that is characterized by an \u201cabsolutely indivisible\nsensation of motion or mobility\u201d (1889 [1910:\n 111\u20132])[6]\n In stressing the process-like character of perceptual experience\nSoteriou (2013) approvingly cites O\u2019Shaughnessy, whose\ncommitment to strong dynamism is plain:\n\n\n[characteristically] the contents of experience are in flux, and\nnecessarily experience itself is in flux, being essentially occurrent\nin nature \u2026 [i]t is not the mere existence of flux [\u2026]\nin the case of experience that is distinctive: it is the\nnecessity of flux. (O\u2019Shaughnessy 2000: 43)\n\n\nIn his Stream of Consciousness (2000) Dainton maintains that\nintrinsic flow and \u201cdynamic patterning\u201d are features of\nour temporal experience, and he takes these features to be as\nprimitive as synchronic phenomenal unity. Torrengo (2017) is also\ncommitted to strong dynamism. He too thinks that all experiences\npossess a flow-like character, a character that is irreducible to\nrepresentational properties of any\n kind.[7]\n",
