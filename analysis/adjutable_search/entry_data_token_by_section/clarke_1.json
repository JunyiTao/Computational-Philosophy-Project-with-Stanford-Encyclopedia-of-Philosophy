Leibniz did not join her in England, and they\ncorresponded across the channel. In one of these letters he attacked\nprominent views in England that Leibniz considered dangerous to\nnatural religion. After mentioning materialism and Lockean doubts\nabout the soul, Leibniz chastises Newton twice. (Newton and Leibniz\nhad sparred earlier over the priority of discovery of the calculus.)\nClarke, who with Newton was attending Caroline\u2019s court, came to\nNewton\u2019s defense. A series of five letters passed through\nCaroline between Leibniz and Clarke over a wide range of issues.\nCaroline is significant not only for her contributions to framing the\ndebate for each correspondent but also as an important context for\nunderstanding the letters (Meli 1999). Leibniz is trying to maintain\nCaroline\u2019s commitment to his system, while Newton and especially the\nmore sociable Clarke are working to convert her with arguments and\nexperimental demonstrations in person. She continued to challenge\nClarke and pledge loyalty to Leibniz until his death, but starting\naround the time of the third letter, it seems that Clarke had won her\nover at least to the existence of the vacuum, which would be difficult\nto maintain without going for the rest of the Clarkean-Newtonian\npicture (Brown 2004, 93\u201398).\n\nToday the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence is easily Clarke\u2019s most\noften read work, which is unfortunately usually published without the\ncover letters to and from Caroline. However, there has long been a\ndispute over Newton\u2019s role in the authorship of the letters.\nLeibniz suspected and Caroline confirmed that Newton at least read\nClarke\u2019s letters before sending them and provided\n\u201cadvice\u201d (Alexander 1956, 189 and 193; Brewster 1855,\n287\u2013288). Since then, scholarly opinion has ranged from\nNewton\u2019s ghostwriting all the letters himself (Koyr\u00e9 and\nCohen 1961, 560ff) to Clarke writing the letters and merely showing\nthem to Newton to make sure there was no disagreement over the\nscientific information (Vailati 1997, 4\u20135). This point is not\neasily decidable, in part because Newton and Clarke were neighbors and\nthus almost no correspondence survives between them, presumably since\nthey would meet in person. Current opinion has shifted toward\nattributing most of the philosophical arguments to Clarke, with the\nblessing of Newton, a move sparked in part by a reappraisal in recent\nyears of Clarke\u2019s status as an original philosopher.\n\nIn reading the letters to Leibniz, it is helpful to remember that the\nviews being defended might not belong only to Clarke or only to\nNewton, so attribution to a single figure might be misguided. What we\nhave might be the intersection of their views, or they might be views\nthat Newton held privately but did not yet want to avow publicly, or\nthey might be a mixture of some of Clarke\u2019s views and some of\nNewton\u2019s views. In some cases, we can see links to other\npublications by Newton and Clarke. For instance, space as a\nsensorium (organ of sensation) of God, which Leibniz\nridiculed in his first letter to Caroline, appeared first in\nNewton\u2019s Principia and Opticks and not in\nClarke\u2019s other works. (Clarke tries to argue that Newton does\nnot believe that space is the sensorium of God, but\nKoyr\u00e9 and Cohen [1961, 563\u2013566] argue that Newton did\nbelieve it and tried to disguise or soften the view in publication.)\nAlso, there are arguments based on the principle of sufficient reason,\nwhich Clarke employed in his Boyle lectures twelve years earlier, but\ndo not play a role in Newton\u2019s publications. Other cases are\nmore difficult to connect to Newton\u2019s and Clarke\u2019s other\nworks, such as the famous passage in which space is called \u201can\nimmediate and necessary consequence of the existence of God,\u201d\nsince \u201cconsequence\u201d is not a term usually used by either\nClarke or Newton on this issue.\n",
