    "main_text": "Agent-Causal Theories || Agent Causation and Reason-Explanation\n3.1 Agent Causation and Reason-Explanation\n\nWe saw in section 1.2 that difficulties confront accounts of acting\nfor a reason and of reason-explanation that do not appeal to the\ncausation of action by the agent\u2019s recognizing certain reasons.\nStandard agent-causal views deny that events such as the agent\u2019s\nrecognizing certain reasons cause any free action (or whatever event\nthe agent directly causes when she acts freely). Such views must,\nthen, offer some alternative account of the phenomenon in\nquestion.\n\nThe most sophisticated such proposal is that advanced by Timothy\nO\u2019Connor (2000b: ch. 5). At the core of the proposal is an\naccount of the reason-explanation of free decisions. As O\u2019Connor\nsees it, agents do not cause free decisions; rather, a free decision\nis a causally complex event, consisting of the agent\u2019s causing\nher coming to have a certain intention. (Such a causally complex event\nis, in turn, a component of any free overt action, such as one\u2019s\nfreely raising one\u2019s arm.) Suppose, then, that someone freely\ndecides to A right now. The decision can be explained by citing an\nantecedent desire, O\u2019Connor maintains, if\n\n\n(a) prior to making that decision, the agent had the desire in\nquestion and believed that A-ing would satisfy (or contribute\nto satisfying) that desire; and\n\n(b) the intention to A that the agent comes to have in making\nthe decision is caused by the agent and is an intention to A\nhere and now in order to satisfy the desire in question (adapted from\nO\u2019Connor 2000b: 86).\n\n\nOne objection to such a view (raised by Feldman and Buckareff [2003])\nis that it appeals to something that is not necessary for the truth of\nthe kind of explanation we are considering. One can decide on the\nbasis of a certain desire, and citing that desire can yield a true\nreason-explanation of one\u2019s decision, even if the intention that\none forms in deciding is not a second-order attitude, an attitude that\nis about (in part) another of one\u2019s attitudes (a certain\ndesire). O\u2019Connor might accept this point and propose that we\nwill have a true reason-explanation as well if the intention that is\nacquired represents, not the desire in question, but rather the object\nof that desire. The proposal would then resemble McCann\u2019s\naccount of reason-explanation. However, it might be objected that one\ncan decide on the basis of a desire even if the intention that one\nforms in making that decision does not represent, in its content, the\nobject of that desire. As we observed in examining McCann\u2019s\nview, an agent sometimes makes a decision for many reasons, and it is\nimplausible that each and every one of the reasons for which a\ndecision is made must enter into the content of that decision.\n\nA further objection is that O\u2019Connor\u2019s account of\nreason-explanation commits him to an implausible view of the\nexplanation of causally complex events. As he has it, whether an\nexplanation citing a state of an agent truly explains the\nagent\u2019s causing her acquisition of a certain intention depends\ncrucially on whether the effect component of this causally complex\nevent has a certain feature, and the truth of the explanation does not\nrequire that the agent\u2019s being in the cited state cause either\nthe causally complex event, the cause component of that event, or the\neffect component of that event. But we do not find this sort of thing\nto be so in cases of any other kinds of causally complex event.\n\nConsider a case that is in important respects analogous to what we are\nexamining here. Suppose that a flash of lightning has caused a brush\nfire. A drought, let us say, had left the brush dry, and had this not\nbeen so, the lightning flash would not have caused the fire, or at\nleast would have been less likely to do so. Now suppose that the\ndryness of the brush is cited as an explanation of the flash\u2019s\ncausing the fire. Does the truth of the proffered explanation hinge on\nwhether the fire has a certain feature, and can the explanation be\ntrue even if the brush\u2019s being dry did not cause either the\nflash, the fire, or the flash\u2019s causing the fire? Apparently\nnot.\n\nThe difficulty here stems from O\u2019Connor\u2019s requirement,\nlike that imposed by most proponents of agent-causal views, that only\nthe agent cause what is directly agent-caused in a free action. On an\nalternative account, it is required that a free action be caused by\nthe agent and nondeterministically caused by certain agent-involving\nevents, such as the agent\u2019s recognizing certain reasons and\nhaving a certain intention. Such a view, it is said, can provide the\nsame accounts of acting for a reason and of reason-explanation as can\nevent-causal theories of free will. And since the event causation that\nis posited is required to be nondeterministic, the view secures the\nopenness of alternatives, even on the assumption that this openness is\nincompatible with determinism. Finally, the required agent causation\nitself is still held to be distinct from causation by any events, and\nso this view may be said to secure the origination of free actions\nthat seemed an appealing feature of standard agent-causal accounts\n(Clarke 1993, 1996, 2003b: ch. 8, and 2011; Mawson [2011: ch. 5] and\nSteward [2012: 217\u2013219] also allow that events can play a\n[nondeterministic] causal role in the production of free actions in\nadditional to the causal role played by the agent).\n\nHere is a brief illustration of a freely made decision, as this type\nof view would have it. Suppose that on some occasion a certain\nindividual, Leo, is deliberating about whether to tell the truth or to\nlie. He recognizes reasons favoring each alternative and has an\nintention to make up his mind now. Suppose that there is a nonzero\nprobability that Leo\u2019s recognizing the reasons favoring telling\nthe truth (together with his having the indicated intention) will\nnondeterministically cause his deciding to tell the truth; and suppose\nthat there is, as well, a nonzero probability that his recognizing the\nreasons favoring lying (together with his having the intention) will\ninstead nondeterministically cause his deciding to lie. Then, given\nall prior conditions, it is open to Leo to make the former decision\nand open to him to make the latter one instead. Now suppose that, as a\nmatter of nomological necessity, in the circumstances, whichever of\nthe open decisions Leo makes, that decision will be made, and it will\nbe caused by his recognizing the reasons that favor it, only if\nLeo\u2014the agent\u2014causes that decision. Finally, suppose that,\nin fact, Leo decides to tell the truth. His decision is caused by him,\nand it is nondeterministically caused by his recognizing reasons\nfavoring the action decided upon (and his having the intention to make\nup his mind). He would make that decision only if he caused it. On\nthis view, Leo\u2019s exercising control over which decision he\nmakes\u2014his determining which of the open decisions he\nmakes\u2014consists in his decision\u2019s being (appropriately)\ncaused by him and by these mental events involving him.\n\nIt is a matter of some dispute whether event causation and agent\ncausation can be combined in this fashion and, if they can be, whether\nthe combination would provide what incompatibilists think necessary\nfor free will. (For discussion of these points, see Clarke 2003b:\n144\u201348 and 2011; Ginet 2002; O\u2019Connor 2000b: 76\u201370;\nand O\u2019Connor and Churchill 2004.)\n",
