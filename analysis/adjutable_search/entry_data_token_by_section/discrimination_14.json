What Good is the Concept of Discrimination?\n\n\nThe concept of discrimination picks out a kind of moral wrong that is\na function of the salient social group membership of the person\nwronged: persons are treated as though they had diminished or degraded\nmoral status on account of their group membership, or they are,\nbecause of their group membership and the relative disadvantages that\nthey suffer due to that membership, made vulnerable to domination and\noppression.  But why have such a concept? Why not simply have the\nconcepts of domination, oppression, and degrading treatment,\nabstracting from whether or not the reasons for such wrongs involve\ngroup membership?\n\n\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, critical moral\nreflection and discussion proceeded largely without the concept of\ndiscrimination. But over the course of the first half of the 20th\ncentury, moral reflection became increasingly sensitive to the fact\nthat many, even most, of the large-scale injustices in history had a\ngroup-based structure: certain members of society were identified by\nothers as belonging to a particular salient group; the group members\nwere consistently denigrated and demeaned by the rest of society and\nby its official organs; and many serious relative disadvantages\nconnected to this denigration and demeaning, such as material\ndeprivation and extreme restrictions on liberty, were imposed on the\nmembers of the denigrated group. It is this historical reality,\napparently deeply rooted in human social life and in the tendency of\nhumans to form in-groups and out-groups, that gives the concept of\ndiscrimination its point and its usefulness. The concept highlights\nthe group-structure of those unjust deprivations and\nrestrictions. \n\n\nAt the same time, the group structure of these injustices does not\nmean that the group as such is the party that is wronged;\nrather, the wrongs are ultimately wrongs to the individual persons\nmaking up the group. Accordingly, the concept of discrimination has\nbecome a useful tool for representing many serious wrongs, while\navoiding the implication that these wrongs are ultimately done to the\ngroups as such.\n\n\nHowever, this understanding of the significance of the concept of\ndiscrimination is challenged by Young, who claims that the concept is\ninadequate for capturing group-based wrongs. She argues that the\nconcept \u201ctends to present the injustices groups suffer as\naberrant, the exception rather than the rule.\u201d Accordingly, she\ncontends that \u201c[i]f one focuses on discrimination as the primary\nwrong that groups suffer, then the more profound wrongs of\nexploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism,\nand violence that we still suffer go undiscussed and\nunaddressed.\u201d (1990: 196\u201397)\n\nNonetheless, contra Young\u2019s understanding,\ndiscrimination against the members of a group can be, and often is,\nsystemic. The reason is that wrongs against individuals on account of\ntheir group membership, especially when perpetrated by members of\ndominant groups, are often not aberrant but form broad social\npatterns. Accordingly, the idea of discrimination can capture the\nsystemic wrongs to which Young refers, while preserving the key moral\nthought that the wrongs are done to individuals.  Thus, discrimination\ntypically involves exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness and so\non, where those wrongs are perpetrated against individuals and, at the\nsame time, track salient social categories.\n\n\nYet, Young is right insofar as she is claiming that systemic wrongs\ncan persist even as direct discrimination recedes: indirect\ndiscrimination can, as we have seen, amplify and perpetuate the\nwrongful harms of diminishing direct discrimination.  Additionally,\nYoung correctly suggests that the idea of discrimination is too weak\nto adequately capture certain sorts of extreme systemic maltreatment\nand abuse.  When disadvantageous treatment exceeds a certain level of\nseverity, it is no longer suitable simply to speak of\ndiscrimination. Enslavement and genocide are forms of wrongful\ndiscrimination, but because of the extremity of the mistreatment they\ninvolve, it would be morally obtuse to characterize them as\ndiscrimination and leave the matter at that.  Clear-headed moral\nthinking demands that their extremity be registered in how they are\ncharacterized, and the idea of discrimination is not, by itself,\nequipped for the task.  Accordingly, the invention of the term\n\u2018genocide\u2019 by Raphael Lemkin (1944 [1973: 79]) and the\nopprobrium that later attached to it were important steps forward in\nunderstanding the distinctions among the different ways in which\nhumans abuse one another on the basis of the salient groups to which\nthey belong.\n",
