    "main_text": "Criticisms of the Doctrine of Progress\n5. Criticisms of the Doctrine of Progress \n\nIf the 19th century is the high water mark of progress narratives, the\nfollowing period is the era of critics.  In general, criticisms of the\ndoctrine of progress fall into two categories.  The first category\ncontains straightforward denials of the claim that the human condition\nis improving.  The second category consists of condemnations of the\ndoctrine of progress on skeptical grounds.\n\n\nConsider the first group of criticisms.  If the human condition is not\nimproving, either circumstances are getting worse, or they are\nfluctuating between some upper and lower bound.  Each alternative is\ncertainly arguable.  Horrific human catastrophes, such as the\ngenocides, wars, and environmental destruction of the 20th century,\ncan bolster the argument that things are getting worse.  But less\ndramatic evidence, like increasing alienation in industrialized\nsocieties, could be cited in support of the same claim.  Then there\nare those who emphasize that natural limits will keep the human\ncondition within certain bounds.  Either the natural environment or\nhuman nature could place limits on improvement and, for that matter,\non deterioration.\n\n\nThe previous criticisms take for granted that it makes sense to speak\nof the human condition as improving or declining.  But one can\nquestion whether these statements are truly coherent.  To vindicate\nsuch sweeping claims, it must be possible to construct an ordering of\npast, present, and future states of affairs.  But, in reality, it is\nsometimes difficult even in the case of individuals to say whether\nchanges have been improvements or not.  Consider the person who is\nforced to reflect and regroup after a mild setback.  In the period\nimmediately after the setback, the person is less content but acting\nwith greater autonomy.  To evaluate the change in the person's\nstate, we must treat the values of being content and being autonomous\nas commensurable, and some will argue that they are not.  Evaluating a\nchange in an entire society involves the same kinds of difficult\ncomparisons, plus a whole collection of additional ones based on\ndistributive concerns.  For instance, if a society becomes wealthier\nand less egalitarian over time, is this an improvement or not?\nFinally, even if we think a complete ordering of states of affairs is\nachievable, we might question the use of dialectical accounts to\njustify violence and catastrophes.  Why should we be reconciled to a\nviolent war just because it set the stage for institutional\nimprovement?\n\n\nOther skeptical arguments point to the difficulty of inferring broad\nhistorical laws from available evidence.  In pursuit of a universal\nhistory, most theorists refuse to create a priori accounts\nand instead rely on empirical inferences.  It is possible to attack\nthe grounds on which theorists infer trends from past and present\nsocial phenomena.  For instance, it is a mistake to equate temporal\nand spatial distance.  Theorists sometimes use contemporary reports of\nAmerica or Africa to draw conclusions about an earlier time in Europe.\nOr, they take what they know about their own history and make\nassumptions about \u201cprimitive\u201d societies based on that\ninformation.  Finally, even if one accurately captures a trend, it is\ndifficult to extrapolate into the future.  If we view humans as free,\nas long as institutional arrangements leave room for choice, the\nfuture is not entirely predictable.\n\n\nAll these arguments appear in the writings of critics of progress.\nProviding a comprehensive survey of the critics is beyond the scope of\nthis article.  Instead, the next section will treat a few important\nauthors who reject the doctrine of progress, as well as one who\nattempts to revive it.  Not all of the critics considered are\npessimists.  One may point out the possibility of a bright future\nwhile emphasizing that it is up to humans to choose it.\n\n",
