    "main_text": "Components of Montague Semantics || Scope and Derivational History\n2.5 Scope and Derivational History\n\nA well known example of scope ambiguity is Every man loves a\nwoman. Is there only one woman involved (e.g. Mother Mary), or\ndoes every man love a different woman? The sentence has no lexically\nambiguous words, and there are no syntactic arguments to assign them\nmore than one constituent structure. How to account for the\nambiguity?\n\nIn Montague 1973, the scope ambiguity is dealt with by providing for\nthe sentence two different derivations. On the reading that\nevery has wide scope, the sentence is produced from every\nman and loves a woman. On the reading that only one\nwoman is involved, the sentence is obtained from Every man loves\nhim\\(_1\\). The him\\(_1\\) is an artifact, a placeholder,\nor, one might say, a syntactic variable. A special kind of rule,\ncalled a \u2018quantifying-in rule\u2019, will replace this\nhim\\(_1\\) by a noun phrase or a pronoun (in case there are\nmore occurrences of this placeholder). The placeholder corresponds\nwith a logical variable that becomes bound by the semantic counterpart\nof the quantifying-in rule. For the sentence under discussion, the\neffect of the application of the quantifying-in rule to a\nwoman and Every man loves him\\(_1\\) is that the desired\nsentence is produced and that the quantifier corresponding with a\nwoman gets wide scope. When we would depict its derivation as a\ntree, this tree would be larger than the constituent structure of the\nsentence due to the introduction and later removal of\nhim\\(_1\\).\n\nThis quantifying-in rule is used by Montague for other phenomena as\nwell. An example is co-referentiality: Mary loves the man whom she\nkissed is obtained from He\\(_1\\) loves the man whom\nhe\\(_1\\) kissed. And the de re reading of\nJohn seeks a unicorn is obtained from a unicorn and\nJohn seeks him\\(_1\\).\n\nMany researchers did not like this analysis in which powerful\nsyntactic rules and artificial symbols (him\\(_1)\\) are used.\nBelow we consider two strategies to remedy.\n\nThe first strategy was to deny the ambiguity. Some linguists have\nargued that the scope order is the same as the surface order; this is\nknown as \u2018Jackendoff\u2019s principle\u2019 (Jackendoff 1972).\nBut there are sentences where this does not work. Others said that it\nis sufficient only to obtain the weakest reading (every wide\nscope), and that the stronger reading is inferred when additional\ninformation is available. But there are sentences for which the\ndifferent scope readings are logically independent, as in Every\nwoman loves one man.\n\nThe second strategy was to capture the ambiguity in another way than\nby the quantifying-in rules. Historically the first method was to put\nthe interpretations of the noun phrases in a store from which these\ninterpretations could be retrieved when needed: different stages of\nretrieving correspond with differences in scope. One might see this as\na grammar in which the direct correspondence between syntax and\nsemantics has been relaxed. The method is called \u2018Cooper\nStore\u2019, after the author who proposed this (Cooper 1983). A\nlater proposal is DRT \\((=\\) Discourse Representation Theory), where\nrepresentations are used to account for such ambiguities (van Eijck\nand Kamp 1997).\n\nA recent method is by means of \u2018lifting rules\u2019 (see\nsection 3.3): the meaning of a noun-phrase is \u2018lifted\u2019 to\na more abstract level, and different levels yield different scope\nreadings (see Hendriks 2001 and Jacobson 2014).\n\nEven if the role of derivational history can be avoided for scope and\nco-referentiality, other phenomena remain for which derivational\nhistories have a role. An example is John wondered when Alice said\nshe would leave. This is ambiguous between John asking for the\ntime of leaving, or for the time of saying. So the sentence is\nambiguous, even though there are no arguments for assigning to it more\nthan one constituent structure. Pelletier (1993) presents this\nsentence and others, and says: \u2018In order to maintain the\nCompositionality Principle, theorists have resorted to a number of\ndevices which are all more or less unmotivated (except to maintain the\nPrinciple): Montagovian \u201cquantifying-in\u201d rules, traces,\ngaps, [\u2026].\u2019 Pelletier\u2019s objection can be\nappreciated if one assumes that meaning assignment is directly linked\nwith constituent structure. But, as explained in Section\n 1.2,\n this is not the case. The derivation specifies which rules are\ncombined in which order, and this derivation constitutes the input to\nthe meaning assignment function. The constituent structure is\ndetermined by the output of the syntactic rules, and different\nderivation processes may generate one and the same constituent\nstructure. In this way, semantic ambiguities are accounted for. One\nshould not call something \u2018constituent structure\u2019 if it is\nnot intended as such, and next refute it because it does not have the\ndesired properties.\n\nThe distinction between a derivation tree and a constituent tree is\nmade in several theories of grammar. In Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs)\nthe different scope readings of the sentence about loving a woman\ndiffer in the order in which the noun-phrases are substituted in the\nbasic tree. A classical example in Chomskyan grammar is The\nshooting of the hunters was bloody, which is ambiguous between\nthe hunters shooting, or the hunters being shot at. The two readings\ncome from two different sources: one in which the hunters is\nthe subject of the sentence, and one in which it is the object.\n",
