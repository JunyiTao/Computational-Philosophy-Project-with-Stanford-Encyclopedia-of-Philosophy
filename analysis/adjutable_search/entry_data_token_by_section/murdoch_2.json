    "main_text": "Murdoch in Her Times\n3. Murdoch in Her Times\n\nAs is generally recognized, the English philosophical tradition has a\nstrong empiricist and anti-metaphysical bent. An important exception\nwas the late 19th and early 20th century\nmovement of a Hegelian-influenced \u201cabsolute idealism\u201d,\nwhose most prominent exponent was F.H. Bradley (1846\u20131924). This\nmovement was seen as discredited by two prominent early\n20th century British philosophers, G.E. Moore and Bertrand\nRussell. The final blow was dealt by A.J. Ayer \u201clogical\npositivist\u201d work, Language, Truth, and Logic,\nchanneling for an English audience views developed by the Vienna\nCircle in the 1920s and 30s. Logical positivism essentially declared\nthat what made a statement meaningful was the possibility of verifying\nit through empirical observation. Science was seen as the paradigm,\nthough not the only, form of meaningful discourse. Metaphysical\nstatements typical of British Idealism, such as that \u201call\nreality is one\u201d or that \u201ctime is unreal\u201d, were\nviewed as meaningless because unverifiable. Ethical and evaluative\nstatements, such as that killing is wrong, were taken to have no\ncognitive significance. Murdoch thus came of age when the metaphysical\ntradition was still within memory (she read Bradley seriously and\ntaught him), even if regarded as discredited. For her entire career,\nshe retained a strong sense of the value of metaphysics both in itself\nand as providing broader visions and structures for moral\nphilosophical reflection, while also appreciating the force of\nespecially a Wittgensteinian critique of traditional metaphysics. Her\nmain tutor at Oxford, Donald MacKinnon, with whom she remained close\nthrough much of her younger life, was a philosophical theologian, and\nhelped influence her in a less positivistic direction, also less\ndistant from and hostile to religion (MacKinnon 1957).\n\nSoon verificationism and its related ethical view,\n\u201cemotivism\u201d (ethical statements express emotions,\nespecially of approval and disapproval) was abandoned and a more\nsophisticated, and (in Oxford) a much more influential view of ethical\nlanguage was developed by R.M. Hare, in his 1952 The Language of\nMorals. Hare said that moral statements did not aim to make\ntruthful assertions, but had a distinct character as prescriptions,\ntelling their addressees to do what is stated in the prescription.\nHare\u2019s view, \u201cuniversal prescriptivism\u201d, said that a\nprescription no matter what its content was moral if the subject\nprescribed it for all (or everyone relevantly similarly situated), and\nin that sense universally.\n\nHare\u2019s account of ethics involved several assumptions, not\nalways articulated, but widely shared in the practice of moral\nphilosophy in the 1950s (and many of them beyond). Murdoch\u2019s\nrejection of all of them provides an essential backdrop to her\ndistinctive approach to ethics.\n\n Fact/value dichotomy: A fact can never entail a\nvalue. If a term appears to be simultaneously factual and evaluative\n(e.g., \u201crude\u201d, to take an example made famous by\nMurdoch\u2019s dear friend Philippa Foot), it is really a conjunction\nof a descriptive/factual meaning and an evaluation conferred on the\nfactual referent by the speaker. This view is inherited from the\nempiricist tradition \u201ccreated in the scientific image\u201d (SG\n1970:\n 28/321[1]).\n Murdoch says it is \u201cthe most important argument in modern moral\nphilosophy\u201d (M&E 1957/EM: 64).\nMoral agents all inhabit the same shared world of\nfacts (M&E 1957/EM: 71).\nValues are not part of the world, capable of being\ndiscovered by individual agents, but are brought to or projected onto\nthe world by moral agents. Quite often, situations present no moral\nissues for the agent at all. \nThe fundamental subject matter of ethics is what acts\npersons should perform, and principles and procedures for determining\nthose acts, not what kind of person it is good to be (e.g., what sort\nof qualities of character, or virtues, it is good to have), or how to\ndescribe the human world, an enterprise Murdoch takes to be inherently\nethical.\n\u201cThe individual\u2019s \u2018stream of\nconsciousness\u2019 is of comparatively little importance, partly\nbecause it is often not there at all, and more pertinently because it\nis and can only be through overt acts that we can characterize another\nperson mentally or morally\u201d (VCM 1956/EM 77). Inner reflection\nis of moral interest only as it issues in choice, decision and\naction. \nMetaphysics has no legitimate role to play in ethics,\nand is not an intellectually coherent project. \nThe role of the moral philosopher is distinct from\nthat of the moralist, who aims to \u201celaborate a moral code or\nencourage its observance\u201d, as Ayer says (Warnock 1960: 131). The task of the\nmoral philosopher is to analyze the character of moral statements, a\nlinguistic/analytic rather than moral enterprise. The moral\nphilosopher qua philosopher should remain neutral on specific moral\nissues or more generally on questions about how to act and live.\n\n\nMurdoch\u2019s rejection of all these views in her writings of the\n1950s and 60s is partly connected with her take on existentialism.\nExistentialism attracted Murdoch partly because it was a philosophy\none could \u201cinhabit\u201d or \u201clive by\u201d [OGG:\n47/337]. For existentialism it mattered tremendously what one did, in\nparticular situations as well as with one\u2019s life overall, and\nhow philosophy was to guide and illuminate that journey. That sense of\nurgency is lacking in British philosophical ethics in its turn toward\ncharacterizing \u201cthe language of morals\u201d, partly because\nthis enterprise was seen as morally neutral, not having implications\nfor conduct. (Murdoch\u2019s friend Foot, who herself famously\nchallenged the idea that the language of morals was morally neutral,\npoignantly captured Murdoch\u2019s relation to the linguistic turn in\nethics: \u201cWe were interested in moral language, she was\ninterested in the moral life\u2026She left us, in the end\u201d\n[Conradi 2001: 302].)\n",
