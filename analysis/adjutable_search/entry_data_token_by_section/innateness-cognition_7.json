    "main_text": "The Resurgence of Empiricism || Connectionism and Dynamic Systems Theory\n3.1 Connectionism and Dynamic Systems Theory\n\n\nOne important trend has been the development of Connectionism as an\nalternative to the \u2018Classical\u2019 conception of the mind\n(Newell & Simon 1976; see Garson 2010 for an overview).\nOn the Classical view, the cognitive mind is best understood on\nthe model of a digital computer that (i) uses symbolic representations\nthat have a combinatorial syntax and semantics, and (ii) manipulates\nthese representations following structure-sensitive processing rules.\nConnectionists replace the Classical view with a model of\npsychological processes as involving networks of simple units with\nweighted connections among the units that control the spread of\nactivation through the network, and \u2018learning\u2019 algorithms\nfor resetting the weights of the connections on the basis of earlier\nbehavior of the network in response to some task. There is\ncontinuing debate about whether the Classical and Connectionist models\nare really incompatible, and some have argued that Connectionist\nsystems are best viewed as implementations of classical symbol-based\nsystems (see Pinker & Prince 1988 for discussion). But\nthe research on psychological processing within the Connectionist\nframework is very different from what one finds in the Classical\ntradition.\n\n\nConnectionism is relevant to the Nativism-Empiricism in two related\nways. In the first place, Connectionism provides a natural format\nfor the Empiricist idea that perception provides the basic elements of\nthe mental system (ideas/network-nodes) and experienced regularities\namong ideas strengthens their connection (associations/weightings) and\nin this way accounts for learning. But a more important idea is\nthat if Connectionism could be established as a real\nalternative to the Classical symbol manipulation approach (and\nnot simply as providing implementations of Classical systems), it could\nhelp undercut a key argument of Chomsky-style Nativism. Here is a\nsimplified version of the target\n argument.[26]\nChomskyans, as we noted (section 1.1.2),\nargued that grammars\u2014and by extension, the rules governing other\ndomains of knowledge\u2014are \u2018psychologically\nreal\u2019. If they are, and the Classical view is correct, then\nit would seem that such rules are present in the mind as symbolic\nconstructions. But these rules, as linguistic grammars make\nplain, involve abstract concepts that are not perceptually available in\nthe data. So if the rules are symbolically represented, then\nthese abstract concepts, which are the constituent elements of the\nrules, are also internally represented. But if the relevant\nconcepts are not perceptually available, how could they be learned by\nEmpiricist-style mechanisms that only track regularities in the stream\nof experience? This sort of Nativist argument was developed in\nFodor 1981. Connectionism rejects the view of mental\nrepresentation on which this argument depends. For the\nConnectionist, information is not in the mind as the semantics of\nmental symbols; as the meanings of terms in the language of\nthought. For the Connectionist, information is distributed as a\npattern of weightings in a network in which none of the nodes\nrepresents anything. So: if this sort of anti-Classical\nConnectionist approach is successful, this particular version of the\nPoverty of the Stimulus argument for Nativism is blocked. \n\n\nThere is continuing controversy about whether Connectionism has\nin-principle limitations that disqualify it as a general model of\ncognitive processing (see Fodor & Pylyshyn 1988 and the\nliterature this critique spawned, which is reviewed in Garson\n2010). But there is a practical problem that is less\ncontroversial, and to understand it, we need to consider more closely\nhow Connectionist nets learn. Imagine that one wants the net to\nlearn the difference between (photos of) male and female faces. A\nset of input nodes will code the photo, activation will pass through a\nset of intermediate nodes, and an answer will appear on the output\nnodes. If the output on a particular input is incorrect (a male\nis misidentified as a female for example), the algorithm that governs\nthe dynamics of the network automatically adjusts the weights of the\nconnections between the various intermediate-layer nodes \u2018in the right\ndirection\u2019 and more inputs are cycled through the system.\nWhen the output is correct over some range of inputs, the net has been\n\u2018trained up\u2019; it has successfully learned to tell male from\nfemale faces in photos. The art in Connectionist modeling is to\ndiscover the best network structure and the right algorithm for\nadjusting the weightings. The problem is that such networks learn\nvery slowly; they often need hundreds of thousands of cycles of inputs,\noutputs, and weight adjustments. But humans and animals learn\nmany things very quickly, sometimes even from one instance and often\nfrom a small set of instances (Garcia et al. 1955; Markman 1989).\n\n\nOne way to approach this discrepancy is to see it as due to the fact\nthat in the typical Connectionist set up, the weights between nodes are\ninitially set to random values, and are (very) slowly reset on the\nbasis of small adjustments. But the fact that the initial\nweightings provide no prior information is arguably an artifact of the\nmodeler\u2019s Empiricist commitment to have all the learning\n\u2018come from experience\u2019. There is nothing in the\ngeneral structure of Connectionist models that would prevent the\nmodeler from starting with a highly constrained set of\nweightings\u2014in this case one that already holistically contains\ninformation of the general features of human faces, and perhaps\ninformation about differences between male and female faces. The\nupshot, then, is that although most actual Connectionist models are\nEmpiricist-friendly in their format and in their representational\ncommitments, they can also be implemented in a way that is congenial to\nNativist ideas. The prior information that the Nativist claims is\npart of the initial state of the organism can be realized by setting\nthe initial patterns of weightings between the nodes in the network in\nsuch a way that learning will happen much more quickly. So while\nConnectionism may avoid the very general commitment to Nativism that\nsome have argued is built into the Classical conception, it is neutral\non the question of whether learning in a particular domain is wholly\nbased on experience or uses innate information (suitably distributed\nacross networks).\n\n\nThis last point applies to Dynamic Systems Theory approaches to\ncognition as well (Thelen & Smith 1994; Port & van\nGelder 1995). Dynamicists hold that human behavior should be\nexplained in terms of sets of differential equations that represent a\nsubject\u2019s trajectory in real time through a space of possible\ntotal cognitive-behavioral states. Because they, like\nanti-Classical Connectionists, reject the Classical paradigm\u2019s\ncommitment to symbol manipulation and computation, they also avoid the\nNativist consequences of that view. But neither Connectionists\nnor Dynamicists are in principle anti-Nativist. However\nwe model an organisms cognitive processes\u2014as executing a\nClassical Von Neumann style program, as reassigning weights to nodes in\nline with a Connectionist back-propagation algorithm, or as moving\nthrough a Dynamicist state space as described by a set of differential\nequations\u2014the question remains: what are the built in initial\nbiases of the system and what role do they play in determining the\nsteady state. One can construct a Connectionist system that is\nantecedently tuned to converge on a specific steady-state, and as such\nwill have a significant Nativist element (Hummel & Biederman\n1992 presents such a system for shape recognition). The same\nseems true of Dynamic Systems models. The oft-used Dynamicist\nexample of a pendulum is \u2018innately specified\u2019 to reach a\nspecific steady state (its point attractor) despite wide\nvariability in its inputs. If very young children do indeed\ndistinguish helpers from hinderers, for example, then this capacity\nwill need to figure in the Dynamicist model. It will be\nappropriate to then ask about the role that the child\u2019s initial\nstructure or configuration played in its coming to have this\ncapacity.\n",
