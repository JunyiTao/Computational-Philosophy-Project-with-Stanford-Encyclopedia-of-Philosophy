The experiment is discussed in the\nconceptual framework of RQM by Waaijer and van Neerven (2019\n [OIR]).\n\nThe application of RQM to the EPR context and the problem of quantum\nnon locality has been initially discussed in Smerlak and Rovelli\n(2007) and (Laudisa 2001). Some of the claims of the earlier\ndiscussion about RQM being \u201clocal\u201d have been questioned,\npointing out that RQM should in any case be \u201cforced to accept\nsome form of non-locality in quantum phenomena\u201d\n(Laudisa 2019: 227). A more recent discussion is in Martin-Dussaud,\nRovelli, and Zalamea (2019), where a specific sense in which quantum\ntheory is non-local from the RQM perspective is specified, and\ndownplayed. See also Pienaar (2018\n [OIR])\n for comments.\n",
