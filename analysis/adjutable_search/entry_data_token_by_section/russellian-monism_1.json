    "main_text": "The Content of Russellian Monism || Varieties of Russellian Monism\n1.2 Varieties of Russellian Monism\n\nWhile all Russellian monists maintain that quiddities are relevant to\nconsciousness\n (section 1.1),\n some construe quiddities themselves as phenomenal properties (Maxwell\n1978; Lockwood 1989, 1992; Rosenberg 2004; Strawson 2003, 2006a,b;\nM\u00f8rch 2014; Goff 2015, 2017; cf. Unger 2005). The result is a\nvariety of Russellian monism known as Russellian panpsychism\n(Chalmers 2013 [2015: 246\u2013247]). Russellian panpsychism is so\ncalled due to the assumption that phenomenality is ubiquitous: it\noccurs everywhere the most basic physical dispositions do. But as a\nterminological matter, one might allow that a Russellian monist theory\ncounts as Russellian panpsychism if it specifies either that at\nleast some of the most basic physical dispositions are underlain\nby phenomenal quiddities (Chalmers 2013 [2015: 246]) or that\nall such dispositions are so underlain (Strawson\n2006a,b).)\n\nPanpsychism has a long philosophical history (see the entry\n panpsychism;\n Skrbina 2005), but some find the doctrine incredible (Searle 1997;\nbut see Chalmers 1997b; Alter and Nagasawa 2012: 90). Here it should\nbe noted that Russellian panpsychists typically do not construe\nquiddities as macrophenomenal properties, that is, as\nfamiliar phenomenal properties such as those commonly associated with\nfeeling pain and seeing red. More often, Russellian panpsychists\nconstrue quiddities as microphenomenal properties, that is,\nas phenomenal properties of microphysical entities. Microphenomenal\nproperties might differ radically from the macrophenomenal sort\n(Chalmers 1996: 293\u2013297; Strawson 2003, 2006a; Rosenberg 2004:\n95). Some Russellian panpsychists construe quiddities as\ncosmophenomenal properties, that is, phenomenal properties of\nthe whole cosmos, which might likewise differ radically from\nmacrophenomenal properties (Goff 2017). So, the sorts of phenomenal\nproperties that, according to Russellian panpsychism, underlie the\nmost basic physical dispositions need not be much like any with which\nwe are familiar. This might make panpsychism more palatable to some\nphilosophers\u2014though, some argue, if such properties differ\nenough from familiar macrophenomenal properties, one might doubt that\nthey deserve to be called phenomenal at all (Kind 2006).\n\nAnother option for Russellian monists is to construe quiddities as\nwhat Chalmers calls protophenomenal properties, which he\ncharacterizes as follows:\n\n\n\u2026protophenomenal properties are special properties\nthat are not phenomenal (there is nothing it is like to have a single\nprotophenomenal property) but that can collectively constitute\nphenomenal properties, perhaps when arranged in the right structure.\n(Chalmers 2013 [2015: 259])\n\n\nThe result is a variety of Russellian monism known as Russellian\npanprotopsychism. Russellian panprotopsychism does not entail\npanpsychism. Perhaps only entities in a limited class (e.g., some\nstates of some animals) have protophenomenal properties that are\narranged in a consciousness-constituting structure. In that case, on\nRussellian panprotopsychism consciousness would occur only in those\nentities and not elsewhere. There are also hybrid varieties of\nRussellian monism, on which some quiddities are phenomenal and others\nare protophenomenal (Holman 2008).\n\nRussellian monism is a distinctive theory in the metaphysics of mind.\nNevertheless, it is possible to identify varieties that correspond to\nmore traditional theories, including physicalism, idealism, neutral\nmonism, and (despite the name) even dualism (see the entries\n physicalism;\n idealism;\n neutral monism;\n and\n dualism).\n On physicalist Russellian monism, both quiddities and structural\nproperties are physical (Stoljar 2001; Pereboom 2011, 2014, 2015,\n2019; Coleman 2012, 2015; Montero 2015; Morris 2016; Brown 2017). On\nidealist Russellian monism, both quiddities and structural properties\nare mental (Bolender, 2001; Adams 2007; Schneider 2018; cf. Chalmers\n1996: 155). On neutral monist Russellian monism, both quiddities and\nstructural properties are neutral, where neutral properties are\nneither physical nor mental but underlie both physical and mental\nproperties (Nagel 1986, 1998; cf. Stoljar 2015; Wishon 2016; also see\nthe discussion of panqualityism in the entry\n panpsychism).\n Finally, Russellian monism could be combined with the traditional\n(e.g., Cartesian) dualist view that the concrete world includes two\nfundamentally distinct sorts of entities, the physical sort and the\nmental sort. This can be done by, for example, identifying structural\nproperties with physical properties and quiddities with certain mental\nproperties (cf. Chalmers 2010: 135).\n\nPhysicalist and neutral monist varieties of Russellian monism are most\nnaturally understood as forms of Russellian panprotopsychism (Alter\nand Coleman 2020b; but see Morris 2016, Brown 2017), whereas idealist\nand dualist varieties are most naturally understood as forms of\nRussellian panpsychism (Chalmers 2013, Schneider 2018). Much of the\nrecent literature on Russellian monism focuses on the physicalist\nvariety, often called Russellian physicalism (Montero 2015).\nRussellian physicalism is usually presented as an alternative to,\nrather than a version of, traditional physicalism. But that might seem\nmisleading. On many traditional physicalist theories, there are\nnon-phenomenal properties that can collectively constitute phenomenal\nproperties, perhaps when arranged in the right\nstructure\u2014microphysical properties, say. On those theories, such\nproperties would qualify as protophenomenal properties by the\ncharacterization quoted above from Chalmers 2013 (Papineau 2002:\n22\u201323, fn. 5).\n\nSome traditional physicalist theories conflict with other aspects of\nRussellian monism. For example, (physicalist) analytic functionalism\n(Armstrong 1968; Lewis 1966, 1972, 1980) conflicts with the Russellian\nmonist\u2019s denial that structural truths alone a priori\nentail all phenomenal truths (see the entry\n functionalism;\n phenomenal truths are truths about consciousness). But other\ntraditional physicalist theories are not similarly disqualified. For\nexample, a posteriori physicalists also deny that structural\ntruths alone a priori entail all phenomenal truths (see the\nentry\n physicalism).\n Nevertheless, in their view, there are non-phenomenal properties that\ncan collectively constitute phenomenal properties, perhaps when\narranged in the right structure. So, one might wonder why a\nposteriori physicalism does not qualify as Russellian\nphysicalism.\n\nChalmers recognizes this problem. He therefore makes two further\nstipulations designed to help distinguish Russellian physicalism from\ntraditional physicalist theories:\n\n\n\u2026(i) protophenomenal properties are distinct from structural\nproperties and (ii) there is an a priori entailment from\ntruths about protophenomenal properties (perhaps along with structural\nproperties) to truths about the phenomenal properties that they\nconstitute. (Chalmers 2013 [2015: 260])\n\n\nGiven those further stipulations, a posteriori physicalists\nwould deny that there are protophenomenal properties. Similar\nconsiderations apply to other traditional physicalist theories.\nRussellian physicalism is different.
