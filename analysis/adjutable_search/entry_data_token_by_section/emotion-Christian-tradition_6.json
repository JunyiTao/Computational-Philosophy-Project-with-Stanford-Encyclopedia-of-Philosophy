    "main_text": "Some Christian emotions || Compassion\n3.3 Compassion\n\nThe following prayer was composed by Mother Teresa of Calcutta for\ndaily use in her Home for the Dying:\n\nDearest Lord, may I see you today and every day in the person of your\nsick, and while nursing them, minister to you.\n\n\nThough you hide yourself behind the unattractive disguise of the\nirritable, the exacting, the unreasonable, may I still recognize you,\nand say:\n\n\u201cJesus, my patient, how sweet it is to serve you.\u201d\n\nLord, give me this seeing faith, then my work will never be\nmonotonous. I will ever find joy in humoring the fancies and\ngratifying the wishes of all poor sufferers.\n\nO beloved sick, how doubly dear you are to me, when you personify\nChrist; and what a privilege is mine to be allowed to tend you.\n\nSweetest Lord, make me appreciative of the dignity of my high\nvocation, and its many responsibilities. Never permit me to disgrace\nit by giving way to coldness, unkindness, or impatience.\n\nAnd O God, while you are Jesus, my patient, deign also to be to me a\npatient Jesus, bearing with my faults, looking only to my intention,\nwhich is to love and serve you in the person of each of your sick.\n\nLord, increase my faith, bless my efforts and work, now and for\nevermore. Amen.\n\n\nNote the prevalence in this prayer of \u201ccognitive\u201d\nmetaphors in the description (prescription) of the moral emotion of\ncompassion: \u2018see,\u2019 \u2018recognize,\u2019\n\u2018appreciate.\u2019 In compassion the primary focus is on the\nsufferer \u2014 someone who is in trouble and in need of help. But as\nMother Teresa expresses the emotion in this prayer, it is very much a\nreligious emotion because of the way in which the sufferer is\nseen. She sees Christ in the sufferer, and in doing so takes herself\nto be seeing something true about the sufferer, a truth that risks\nbeing obscured by the outward repulsiveness, both sensory and\nbehavioral, of many of those to whom she ministered.\n\nThe religious character and distinctiveness of Christian compassion\ncan be brought out by comparing it with an emotion that we might call\ntragic compassion, since it is central to the ethos and teaching of\nthe Greek tragedians. Aristotle neatly summarizes the grammar of this\ncompassion:\n\nLet compassion then be a kind of pain excited by the sight of evil,\ndeadly or painful, which befalls one who does not deserve it, an evil\nwhich one might expect to come upon oneself or one of one\u2019s friends,\nand when it seems near. For it is evident that one who is likely to\nfeel pity must be such as to think that he, or one of his friends, is\nliable to suffer some evil\u2026 (The Art of Rhetoric\n1385b).\n\n\nAristotle analyses tragic compassion as involving three propositions,\nso to speak: (1) the sufferer\u2019s suffering is serious; (2) the sufferer\ndoes not deserve his suffering; 3) the sufferer\u2019s suffering is of a\nkind that could well touch me [the subject of the emotion] too (Martha\nNussbaum devotes Part II of her Upheavals of Thought to this\nemotion-type). We might say that compassion is a construal of the\nsituation \u2014 the sufferer, his suffering, the etiology of the\nsuffering, and the emotional subject\u2019s own condition compared with\nthat of the sufferer \u2014 in terms of these three formal\npropositions.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious difference between tragic compassion and\nMother Teresa\u2019s is the fact that the latter involves the proposition\nthe sufferer is a type (brother, sister, beloved) of Christ.\nThis has the implication that Christian compassion is not primarily a\n\u201ckind of pain.\u201d It is uncomfortable certainly, and the\nsubject of this compassion is moved to alleviate the suffering as she\ncan; but it is also a joy, and the work is \u201csweet,\u201d and\nthe poor sufferers are \u201cdoubly dear\u201d \u2014 dear on their\nown account and on Christ\u2019s. Mother Teresa expresses an almost erotic\nenthusiasm for the people she serves, and it is because she loves\nChrist above all. The prayer exudes not just compassion, but also\ngratitude and devotion, and the compassion derives its character in\npart from these other emotions, which in turn have their character\nbecause of the belief-system in which Mother Teresa lives.\n\nAn equally significant departure from the grammar of tragic compassion\nis the denial of the necessity of proposition 2) the sufferer does\nnot deserve his suffering. This denial comes out in one of the\nparadigm texts for Christian compassion, the Parable of the Prodigal\nSon in Luke 15.11\u201332. The younger of two sons asks his father\nfor his share of the inheritance ahead of time, and the son takes the\nmoney and goes abroad where he \u201csquander[s] his property in\nloose living\u201d (vs. 13). When the money is depleted a famine\ndescends on his country of residence, and he is destitute. He gets a\njob feeding pigs, and is miserable and hungry. He has the bright idea\nof returning to his father in the role of a common laborer on the home\nfarm.\n\nAnd he arose and came to his father. But while he was yet at a\ndistance, his father saw him and had compassion\n(esplanchnisth\u0113), and ran and embraced him and kissed\nhim. And the son said to him, \u201cFather, I have sinned against\nheaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son;\ntreat me as one of your hired servants.\u201d But the father said to\nhis servants, \u201cBring quickly the best robe, and put it on him;\nand put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet; and bring the\nfatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry; for this my\nson was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.\u201d\nAnd they began to make merry (vss 20\u201324).\n\n\nThe father can hardly be ignorant of the proposition my son\ndeserves this suffering that he has brought on himself; and the\nson himself dins the proposition into his father\u2019s head. But the\nfather\u2019s compassion is unaffected by the knowledge. The father in the\nparable is of course God, whose nature as gracious and forgiving is\nindicated in the parable. So Mother Teresa, unlike the characters in\nthe Greek tragedies, is not interested in the question whether the\nsufferer brought his woes on himself through his choices. It is this\ngracious and forgiving God whose Son Mother Teresa sees and loves in\neach of her poor sufferers.\n\nAs to the third proposition, the Christian would no doubt generally\nacknowledge it, but it seems to figure differently in Christian than\nin tragic compassion. It does not seem to be a major consideration in\nMother Teresa\u2019s compassion that the same thing might happen to her as\nhas happened to her poor sufferers. The difference turns on the phrase\n\u201cmight happen.\u201d It is part of Mother Teresa\u2019s spiritual\ndiscipline \u2014 her self-cultivation in the Christian emotions\n\u2014 that she deliberately puts herself, as much as practicable, in\nthe position of those she ministers to. Early in her ministry she had\nto be persuaded to provide herself and her fellow nuns a bit\nmore food than the average Calcutta street person consumed, so as to\nmaintain her health well enough to continue her ministry. In this\naspiration to identify with sufferers she imitates Christ, who lowered\nhimself to the status of a servant and died the death of a criminal,\nout of compassion for humanity. In the nervous \u201cit might happen\nto me too\u201d of tragic compassion there is an aloofness from the\nsufferer and his suffering that is absent in the most paradigmatic\nexemplars of Christian compassion.\n\nChristian compassion, like contrition and gratitude, does have an\nelement faintly reminiscent of Schleiermacher\u2019s feeling of absolute\ndependence. And again, it comes from the gratitude that is in the near\nvicinity of compassion. Unlike the subject of tragic compassion, the\nsubject of Christian compassion construes herself as having been first\nthe object of God\u2019s compassion. One might say that Mother Teresa\u2019s\ncompassion towards poor sufferers springs from her gratitude to Christ\nfor his compassion towards her and all humankind. But the reminiscence\nis only faint. Gratitude is not what Schleiermacher calls the feeling\nof absolute dependence. Indeed, the feeling of absolute dependence\ndoes not seem to be the essence of any of the Christian emotions.\nRudolf Otto\u2019s stress on fear (tremor) or blank wonder\n(stupor) also seems not to express the essence of Christian\ncompassion. Christian doctrine does teach that God is fearsome and\nwonderful, but other attributes of God are much more to the fore in\nthe emotion of compassion: God\u2019s fatherly nurturing tenderness and\nforgiveness, his long-suffering love. William James\u2019s critique of the\nessentialist tendency in the religious philosophy of the emotions\nseems on target: God has a variety of attributes, and these are\nreflected in a variety of emotion-types, none of which has any more\nclaim than the others to constitute the essence of religious emotion.\nThe diverse emotion types have in common that their grammar makes\nreference to God, but the attributes of God that they cite vary with\nthe emotion types.\n\nOtto states that the response to the mysterium tremendum is\nnot necessarily moral and explains this by saying that the emotion\ndoes not necessarily posit God as a moral judge or law-giver. But\ncompassion does seem to be necessarily moral, though it is true that\nthe idea of God as judge or law-giver is not particularly in the\npicture. The moral attribute of God that is quite directly posited by\nthe emotion is that of mercy or compassion. The sufferer is construed\nas one with whom Christ has identified and for whom Christ has\nsuffered. The other two emotions that we have looked at are also\nessentially moral: contrition is a construal of oneself as morally at\nfault and spoiled, and here the idea of God as judge is involved; and\ngratitude, as a construal of oneself as indebted for a gift, has\nreference to a kind of justice (though it is clearly not standard\nretributive justice [see Roberts 2004]).\n",
