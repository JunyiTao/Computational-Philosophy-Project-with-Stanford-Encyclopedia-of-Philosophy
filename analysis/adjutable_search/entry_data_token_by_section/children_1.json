Philosophy in a Crowded Curriculum\n\nThose favoring adding philosophy to K-12 school programs face the\nchallenges of an already crowded curriculum and growing pressure to\nprovide quantifiable evidence of student mastery of the standard\nsubjects of history, literature, math, and science. Where is time to\nbe found for the give-and-take of philosophical discussions? Adding\nphilosophy to the mix, doubters object, only makes matters worse. Not\nonly is it yet another subject, it is one that many teachers may find\nunsettling. They may fear that philosophy\u2019s continual\nquestioning will actually interfere with students\u2019 mastery of\nthe subjects already in the curriculum. Given the unsettling nature of\nmuch philosophical inquiry, they may feel vulnerable as teachers\nbecause they are not confident of their own answers to the questions\nposed.\n\nAdding to this problem is increasing pressure on teachers to\ndemonstrate that their students are performing at satisfactory levels\nin already established subjects. Standardized tests are commonly used\nas the measure of student achievement. Marked by definitive,\nunambiguous questions and answers, these tests do not place a premium\non philosophical reflection. Since student performance is typically\nlinked to school funding, this is not something teachers can take\nlightly, however skeptical some of them might be about the educational\nvalue of preparing their students to perform well on standardized\ntests.\n\nIn response, advocates of bringing philosophy into the schools such as\nMatthew Lipman and his colleague Ann Margaret Sharp have countered\nthat the introduction of philosophy can enhance the entire educational\nexperience of students. They urge that the aim is more than simply the\nintroduction of one more subject in the schools. Philosophy, they\ninsist, invites students to reflect on relationships among different\nareas of inquiry and to make sense of their educational experiences as\na whole. This can add to the meaningfulness of students\u2019\neducation as a whole. In addition, philosophy can make important\ncontributions to another area of concern that cuts across the\ncurriculum, critical thinking.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Matthew Lipman became dismayed at the low quality of\nargumentation employed by presumably well-educated citizens discussing\nthe Vietnam war and society\u2019s ills in general. Convinced that\nthe teaching of logic should begin long before college, he tried to\nfigure out a way to do this that would stimulate the interest of\n10\u201311 year olds. Leaving his secure position of teaching\nphilosophy at Columbia University for an open ended one at Montclair\nState College, he undertook work on his first children\u2019s novel,\nHarry Stottlemeier\u2019s Discovery. Lipman\u2019s concerns\nabout the level of critical thinking in society in general, and the\nschools in particular, were not his alone. By the 1970s the hue and\ncry for teaching critical thinking in the schools was, if not clear,\nat least loud; and it has continued largely unabated to the\npresent.\n\nWhat is meant by \u2018critical thinking\u2019? Characterizations\nrange in complexity from Robert Ennis\u2019s admirably brief,\n\u201creasonable reflective thinking that is focused on deciding what\nto believe or do\u201d (Ennis 1987) to a complex statement by a group\nof 46 panelists convened by the American Philosophical\nAssociation\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy to employ the\nDelphi Method of striving for consensus:\n\nWe understand critical thinking to be purposeful, self-regulatory\njudgment which results in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, and\ninference, as well as explanation of the evidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations upon\nwhich that judgment is based\u2026. The ideal critical thinking is\nhabitually inquisitive, well-informed, trustful of reason,\nopen-minded, flexible, fair-minded in evaluation, honest in facing\npersonal biases, prudent in making judgments, willing to reconsider,\nclear about issues, orderly in complex matters, diligent in seeking\nrelevant information, reasonable in the selection of criteria, focused\nin inquiry, and persistent in seeking results which are as precise as\nthe subject and the circumstances of inquiry permit. (Facione, 1989)\n\n\nLipman was a member of this panel, and it is clear that his novels and\nteacher\u2019s manuals all strive to meet these objectives. His\nbriefer depiction of critical thinking is that it involves judgments\nbased on criteria, or reasons. Criteria, he says, can be appraised in\nterms of \u201cmegacriteria\u201d such as reliability, relevance,\nstrength, coherence, and consistency (Lipman 1991, p. 119). Critical\nthinking, he adds, is characterized as \u201cthinking that (1)\nfacilitates judgment because it (2) relies on criteria, (3) is\nself-correcting, and (4) is sensitive to context.\u201d (Lipman 1991,\np. 116)\n\nPicking up on the idea that critical thinking is sensitive to context,\nsome critics challenge the notion that critical thinking can be\nusefully taught independently of specific disciplinary areas (McPeck,\n1985). While conceding that there are some generic features of\ncritical thinking that cut across disciplines, they maintain that even\nthese features acquire their meanings only in specific contexts that\nvary across disciplines (such as history, sociology, biology,\nchemistry). However, unless the different disciplines ask questions\nabout their own basic assumptions and their relationships to one\nanother, critical thinking within those disciplines will overlook\nimportant questions that need attention. Philosophy does ask such\nquestions about the different disciplines, including itself.\n\nLipman\u2019s hope was that philosophy would acquire a central place\nin the K-12 curriculum, thus enabling students to develop their\ncritical thinking skills through philosophical questioning. At the\nsame time, he claimed, philosophy can help students make better sense\nof their educational experiences. By seeking to develop comprehensive\nperspectives, philosophy attempts to understand connections. A\ncurriculum that divides students\u2019 education into discrete,\nself-contained disciplines without encouraging philosophical questions\nabout the nature of those disciplines and their relationships to one\nanother invites a fragmented view of education. Lipman\u2019s\nproposed alternative is described in the next section, which describes\nthe K-12 program developed by the Institute for the Advancement of\nPhilosophy for Children (IAPC) that he and Ann Margaret Sharp\nfounded.\n\nShort of the ambitious program Lipman and his IAPC colleagues had in\nmind for the schools, there are more modest, but worthwhile, ways of\nbringing philosophical inquiry into the already existing disciplinary\nstructure in the schools. Teachers can invite their students to\nreflect on philosophical aspects of their subjects of study. At the\nsame time they study history, students can take some time to ask\nquestions about the extent to which historical accounts can be\nobjective\u2014and questions about what \u2018objectivity\u2019\nmight mean, and why it is or is not important to seek it. Similar\nquestions can be asked about the natural and social sciences,\nincluding questions about the extent to which science is, or ought to\nbe, \u201cvalue-free\u201d. In fact, if room for such questions is\nnot encouraged, one might well ask to what extent critical thinking\nitself is encouraged.\n\nFinally, especially since the passing of Lipman and Sharp in 2010 and\n2011, many of those originally inspired by their work have initiated\nefforts to introduce groups of children to philosophy outside the\nformal educational setting of the schools.\n",
