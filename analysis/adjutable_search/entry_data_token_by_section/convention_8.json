    "main_text": "Critical reactions to Lewis || Regularities de facto and de jure\n4.1 Regularities de facto and de jure\n\n\nLewis\u2019s definition of convention demands complete or\nnear-complete conformity. Many commentators object that this is too\nstrict, excluding conventions \u201cmore honored in the breach than\nthe observance.\u201d To take Margaret Gilbert\u2019s example (1989),\nthere might be a convention in my social circle of sending thank-you\nnotes after a dinner party, even though few people actually observe\nthis convention anymore. Lewis must deny that sending thank-you notes\nis a convention, a verdict which Gilbert and other commentators find\nunintuitive. Wayne Davis (2003) and Ruth Millikan (2005) develop\nsimilar objections.\n\n\nThis objection sometimes accompanies another: that Lewis overlooks the\nessentially normative character of conventions. The idea is\nthat conventions concern not just how people actually behave but also\nhow they should behave. In other words, conventions are\nregularities not (merely) de facto, but de jure. For\ninstance, if there is a convention that people stand a certain distance\nfrom one another when conversing, then it seems natural to say that\npeople should stand that distance when conversing. It is not\nobvious that Lewis can honor these intuitions, since his conceptual\nanalysis does not mention normative notions. On this basis, Margaret\nGilbert (1989) and Andrei Marmor (1996) conclude that Lewis has not\nprovided sufficient conditions for a convention to prevail among some\ngroup.\n\n\nA closely related idea is that violations of convention elicit some\nkind of sanction, such as tangible punishment or, more\ncommonly, negative reactive attitudes. Lewis emphasizes the\nself-perpetuating character of convention: one conforms\nbecause it is in one\u2019s interest to conform, given that others\nconform. But, the argument goes, this emphasis overlooks a distinct\nenforcement mechanism: non-conformity elicits some kind of sanction\nfrom other people.\n\n\nLewis (1969, pp. 97\u2013100) anticipates such objections and attempts to\nforestall them. He argues that conventions will tend to become norms.\nOnce a convention prevails in some population, any member of the\npopulation will recognize that others expect him to conform to it and\nthat they prefer he do so. He will also recognize that conforming\nanswers to his own preferences. It follow that he ought to\nconform, since, other things being equal, one ought to do what answers\nboth to one\u2019s own preferences and to those of other people.\nMoreover, if people see that he fails to conform, then they will tend\nto sanction him through punishment, reproach, or distrust, since they\nwill see that he acts contrary both to his own preferences and to\ntheirs. To some extent, this argument recalls Hume\u2019s argument in\nthe Treatise that conventions of property generate moral\nnorms. Robert Sugden (1986/2004) develops the line of thought in more\ndetail.\n\n\nGilbert responds to such arguments by noting that, even if they show\nthat conventions have a tendency to acquire normative force,\nthey do not show that normativity is essential to convention.\nTheoretically, it seems possible for rational agents to instantiate a\nLewisian convention without regarding it as a norm and without making\nany effort to enforce the convention through sanctions. Thus, Gilbert\nconcludes, Lewis\u2019s account does not preserve the intrinsic link\nbetween convention and normativity.\n\n\nEven if one sympathizes with this objection, how to elucidate more\nsystematically the normativity of convention remains unclear. It does\nnot seem to be the normativity of morality, since someone who violates\nsome convention of, say, etiquette or fashion need not thereby act\nimmorally. Nor is it straightforwardly reducible to the normativity of\ninstrumental rationality: many philosophers want to say that, other\nthings being equal, one should conform to convention quite\nindependently of whatever one\u2019s beliefs and desires happen to be.\n(\u201cYou really ought to send a thank-you note.\u201d) What is this\nmysterious brand of normativity, which apparently derives from neither\nmorality nor instrumental rationality? That question is still a focus\nof active philosophical research.\n",
