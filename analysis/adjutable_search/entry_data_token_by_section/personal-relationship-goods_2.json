    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods in General || The Ethics of Care\n2.1 The Ethics of Care\n\nAn influential strand of feminist ethics developed over the past four\ndecades, the ethics of care, is one area of philosophy that implicitly\nrecognizes personal relationship goods because \u201ccare\u201d is,\nitself, a main relationship good which has been claimed to play a\ncentral role in moral, and, more recently, in political thinking.\n\nPerhaps the best way to individuate the ethics of care is as a strand\nof ethics concerned with the meeting of the needs of others within\npersonal relationships (Tronto 1993). But \u201ccare\u201d is used\nin feminist ethics to refer to slightly different things (Collins\n2015). The reference to needs is the common link between different\naccounts of the proper subject-matter of the ethics of care. (In this\nentry, \u201cneeds\u201d and \u201cimportant interests\u201d are\nused interchangeably). The ethics of care is, first, about a type of\nwork, or labor, as when someone is said to \u201ctake care of\u201d\nsomeone else in situations like nursing a baby or looking after an ill\nperson. Some care ethicists ascribe special, if not exclusive, moral\nvalue to caring for those individuals who cannot meet the needs in\nquestion themselves (Bubeck 1995). This meaning often extends to a\nwider range of activities such as education or physical and mental\nhealth care. According to a second view, the ethics of care is about\nclose relationships between persons, based on a special emotional bond\nand including a commitment to each other\u2019s wellbeing (Ruddick\n1998). Much of the ethics of care\u2014at least in early\nstages\u2014has focused on close personal relationships such as\nmothering or friendship; the assumption here is that caring meets the\nneed for bonding, or attachment (Gheaus 2009: 64). In a third way,\n\u201ccare\u201d is understood as a disposition to behave in certain\nways: to be attentive and sensitive to other people\u2019s needs and\nwilling to help them. In this sense, \u201ccare\u201d is a virtue,\nand the ethics of care a form of virtue ethics. As a virtue, care is a\ngeneral attitude, opposed to callousness and indifference to the needs\nof others.\n\nWhether understood as an activity, relationship or disposition geared\ntowards meeting needs, care has been attributed universal moral value.\nMany care ethicists were interested in the crucial role of care-giving\nfor agency and for individual and species survival. First, without\nreceiving care within relationships, infants are unlikely to survive,\nlet alone thrive (Ruddick 1989). Moreover, care is necessary for the\ncoming into existence of persons: it is only within relationships with\ngood care-givers that children can acquire moral knowledge and\ndispositions and, ultimately, full agency (Held 1993). Similarly, some\ncare ethicists argue that friendship is necessary for developing a\nrich sense of autonomy, since friends give us the most direct access\nto particular values and conceptions of the good (Friedman 1993)\nSecond, as Eva Kittay argues, care has universal value because most\nindividuals require it to different degrees at different moments\nthroughout their lives beyond infancy or childhood: some of us only\nduring illness and old age, while others\u2014people who are\nchronically ill or disabled\u2014more or less continuously (Kittay\n1999).\n\nBecause it is necessary for the creation of persons, care ethicists\nhave claimed that care is more basic to morality than rights and\nduties, since in its absence most rights are useless. Care being so\nbasic to our survival and flourishing provides a presumptive reason to\nassume there are duties to ensure that everyone receives sufficient\ncare. It is difficult to determine what some care ethicists think\nabout such a duty, because the ethics of care has, at least in the\nbeginning, been coined in opposition to the language of rights and\nduties (Gilligan 1982; Noddings 1984). More generally, much of the\nethics of care arose from a skepticism concerning moral principles\n(Collins 2015). Thus, the question of whether we have a general duty\nof beneficence to extend our care to those who seem to be left out has\nnot received much attention (but for a recent exception see Collins\n2013).\n\nMore recently, care ethicists interested in theories of distributive\njustice have defended the view that care is one of the goods whose\ndistribution should concern us. This means that we ought to shape\ninstitutions to ensure that everyone receives care in accordance to\nthe demands of justice. Kittay proposed a principle of distributing\ncare that regulates both the giving and the receiving of care:\n\n\nTo each according to his or her need for care, from each according to\nhis or her capacity for care, and such support from social\ninstitutions as to make available resources and opportunities to those\nproviding care, so that all will be adequately attended in relations\nthat are sustaining. (Kittay 1999: 113)\n\n\nSimilarly, Daniel Engster (2007) believes that care is the core of\nmorality: because human dependency is universal, individuals have a\nmoral duty to care for others as well as a moral right to receive care\nwhen they cannot meet the relevant needs themselves. The duty is to\ngive care, when possible, directly; but, because uncoordinated\nindividuals cannot ensure that everyone receives adequate care,\ngovernments should take on the responsibility to organize it such that\nit reaches all individuals in times of need.\n\nA new wave of philosophical work (reviewed in\n section 3)\n looks more closely at the goods that are uniquely available through\npersonal relationships, including relationships based on care, and\nprovides a variety of reasons why there may be duties to provide these\ngoods. Most of these views have a particular interest in reasons why\nthe distribution of (access to) these goods is a matter of\njustice.\n",
