    "main_text": "Generalist versus Specialist Knowledge\n5. Generalist versus Specialist Knowledge\n\n\nNo one account categorizes the sciences of early China, but we find\nsome account of them in the last two sections of the Bibliographic\nTreatise of the Han Dynastic History (Han shu, chapter 30). We see in\nthe categorizations and authorship of the Treatise a polarization\nbetween two groups whom can be called Masters textualists and technical\nexperts.\n\n\nThe Han shu Bibliographic Treatise consists of six\nsections: (1) the Six Arts (liu yi \u516d\u85dd) or\nClassics (liu jing \u516d\u7d93), (2) Masters (zhu\nzi \u8af8\u5b50) texts of Warring States philosophy, (3)\nPoetry (shi fu \u8a69\u8ce6), (4) Military works (bing\nshu \u5175\u66f8), (5) Numbers and Techniques (shu\nshu \u6578\u8853), and (6) Recipes and Methods (fang\nji \u65b9\u6280).\n\n\nThe \u201cNumbers and Techniques\u201d (shu shu) section\nincludes the names of texts on astronomy, and cosmology in the sections\ntitled Patterns of Heaven (tian wen \u5929\u6587) and\nCalendars and Chronologies (li pu \u6b77\u8b5c).\nAdditional information appears under sections titled Five Agents\n(wu xing \u4e94\u884c), and morphoscopy. Patterns of\nHeaven includes texts on divination by stars and weather phenomena\n(clouds, mists, qi configurations), and mapping the constellations.\nCalendars and Chronologies includes texts on calendric computations and\nmovements of the heavenly bodies. Five Agents also contains mantic\ntexts concerning prognostication by yin and yang and the Five Agents,\nincluding portents, hemerology, calendric astrology. A subsection\ntitled Turtle and Yarrow (shi gui \u84cd\u9f9c) contains\ntexts on turtle-shell and yarrow divination, including the Zhou yi\n(Zhou Changes), the original text of the Yi jing or\nBook of Changes. Two other subsections address Miscellaneous\nDivination (za zhan \u96dc\u5360) and Morphoscopy\n(xing fa \u5211\u6cd5), including works on geography,\nphysiognomy, and topomancy.\n\n\nInformation on medicine and pharmacology appears in the sixth\nsection, Recipes and Methods. It includes works on medicine and\nlongevity, including medical classics, classical recipes, sexual arts,\nand immortality practices. These chapters reflect the concerns and\nexpertise of the technical and ritual specialists closely associated\nwith the \u201cRecipe Masters\u201d (fang shi\n\u65b9\u58eb) associated with the Han court. But their concerns\nalso appear in early philosophical texts, and the separation of\nphilosophy from the categories of religion and science is artificial\nand problematic (Harper 1998 and 1999; Kalinowski 2004). Recipes and\nMethods (fang ji \u65b9\u6280) includes: Medical Classics\n(yi jing \u91ab\u7d93), Classical Recipes (jing\nfang \u7d93\u65b9), Sexual arts (fang zhong\n\u623f\u4e2d) and Immortality practices (shen xian\n\u795e\u4ed9).\n\n\nSeveral things are striking about this categorization. The first is\nthe relative confinement of \u201cChinese philosophy\u201d to the\nfirst two (or arguably three) sections of the Treatise, particularly\nthe Masters section. The eight sections of the Masters category include\nmost of the texts of early Chinese philosophy. They are grouped under\nthe rubrics of: \u201cRu\u201d (Ru jia \u5112\u5bb6,\noften mistranslated as \u201cConfucian\u201d), Daoists (Dao\njia \u9053\u5bb6), Yin-yang (Yin-yang jia\n\u9670\u967d\u5bb6), Legalists (Fa jia\n\u6cd5\u5bb6), Names (Ming jia \u540d\u5bb6) Mohists\n(Mo jia \u58a8\u5bb6), vertical and horizontal alliances\n(Zong heng jia \u7e31\u6a6b\u5bb6, also known as\n\u201cMilitarists\u201d), Miscellaneous (Za jia\n\u96dc\u5bb6), the school of Shen Nong (Shen Nong jia\n\u795e\u8fb2\u5bb6) and Smaller Teachings (Xiao Shuo\n\u5c0f\u8aaa). But it is important to note that these are the\n\u201cschools\u201d of Han anthologists and commentators. Recent\nscholarship and the evidence of texts excavated from tombs has shown\nthe arbitrariness of these classifications. For example, texts\nexcavated from Guodian \u90ed\u5e97 and the so-called Shanghai\nMuseum texts resist classification as Ru or Daoist (Shi ji,\n130, 3288\u201392; Csikszentmihalyi and Nylan 2003, Smith 2003).\n\n\nA second important point is the very different preservation and\nauthorship of the first and second half of the Treatise. While the\nfirst three sections contain many titles that are no longer extant,\nthey all contain significant numbers of extant texts. By contrast, the\nlast three sections consist almost entirely of the titles of lost\ntexts.\n\n\nThe two halves of the treatise also differ in their authorship. The\nfirst three sections were compiled by Liu Xiang. The last three, by\ncontrast, were compiled by technical experts. The fourth\n\u201cMilitary Works\u201d section of the Bibliographic Treatise was\ncompiled by Ren Hong \u4efb\u5b8f, a Colonel of Foot Soldiers under\nHan Chengdi (Yates 1988). The \u201cShu shu\u201d category\nwas compiled by an astronomical official: the Taishi\n\u592a\u53f2 Yin Xian \u5c39\u54b8 (Han shu, 30,\n1775). The Recipes and Methods section was compiled by the imperial\nphysician Li Zhuguo \u674e\u67f1\u570b. This distinction between\nwhat appear to be three generalist and three specialist categories of\nthe Treatise can be seen as a continuation of Warring States claims for\nthe superiority of a flexible and general intellect over specific and\ntechnical arts. In this kind of Warring States argumentation, claims\nfor comprehensive wisdom and universality sought to establish sole\npossession of way of the sage kings of antiquity, of which competing\ntraditions possessed only part. Such claims appear in the\nZhuangzi and in attacks on competing schools by Xunzi and Han\nFei (Lewis 1999, Raphals 2008\u20132009). Thus the authors of Han\ncollectanea privileged generalists in their comprehensive syntheses of\ncompeting traditions (Lewis 1999). In this way, the organization of the\nTreatise asserted the superiority of general and universal knowledge\nover military, mantic, and medical knowledge, deliberately framed as\ntechnical and limited in nature.\n\n\nFinally, Masters texts suggest active competition between the\ntextual specialists of the Masters schools and the technical experts\nwhose knowledge and expertise is reflected in the last three sections\nof the Treatise. This competition involved career choice, patronage,\nstudents and the status of genres and modes of knowledge. For\nexample, Michael Puett (2002) argues for an interwoven history of\ninteractions between fang shi and the court officials in which\ncourt sponsored interpretations of ancient philosophical texts were in\npart a response to the fang shi.\n\n\nLate Warring States claims for the superiority of a flexible and\ngeneral intellect over specific and technical arts continued into the\nHan dynasty. In particular, claims for universal and comprehensive\nwisdom sought to establish sole possession of way of the sage kings of\nantiquity, of which competing traditions possessed only part. This\nattitude is reflected in the structure of Han collectanea, which also\nprivileged general and universal knowledge over any specialist\nexpertise, including science. The result is the formation and\npropagation of two distinct and sometimes competing intellectual\ncommunities of \u201cphilosophical\u201d literary elites and\ntechnical experts.\n",
