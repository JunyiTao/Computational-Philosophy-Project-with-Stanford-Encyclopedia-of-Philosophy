    "main_text": "\n\nWilliam Whewell (1794\u20131866) was one of the most important and\ninfluential figures in nineteenth-century Britain. Whewell, a\npolymath, wrote extensively on numerous subjects, including mechanics,\nmineralogy, geology, astronomy, political economy, theology,\neducational reform, international law, and architecture, as well as\nthe works that remain the most well-known today in philosophy of\nscience, history of science, and moral philosophy. He was one of the\nfounding members and a president of the British Association for the\nAdvancement of Science, a fellow of the Royal Society, president of\nthe Geological Society, and longtime Master of Trinity College,\nCambridge. In his own time his influence was acknowledged by the major\nscientists of the day, such as John Herschel, Charles Darwin, Charles\nLyell and Michael Faraday, who frequently turned to Whewell for\nphilosophical and scientific advice, and, interestingly, for\nterminological assistance. Whewell invented the terms\n\u201canode,\u201d \u201ccathode,\u201d and \u201cion\u201d for\nFaraday. In response to a challenge by the poet S.T. Coleridge in\n1833, Whewell invented the English word \u201cscientist;\u201d\nbefore this time the only terms in use in that language were\n\u201cnatural philosopher\u201d and \u201cman of science\u201d.\nWhewell was greatly influenced by his association with three of his\nfellow students at Cambridge: Charles Babbage, John Herschel, and\nRichard Jones. Over the winter of 1812 and spring of 1813, the four\nmet for what they called \u201cPhilosophical Breakfasts\u201d at\nwhich they discussed induction and scientific method. For the next 50\nyears these friends remained in contact, developing their view of\ninductive reasoning and applying it in diverse realms (see Snyder\n2011).\n\nWhewell is most known today for his extensive works on the history and\nphilosophy of science. His philosophy of science was attacked by John\nStuart Mill in his System of Logic, causing an interesting\nand fruitful debate between them over the nature of inductive\nreasoning in science, moral philosophy, and political economy (for\ndiscussions of this debate, see Hutton 1850; Losee 1983; Snyder 2006;\nMillgram 2014; Menke 2018; Gaukroger 2019; Snyder 2021). It is in the\ncontext of the debate over philosophy of science that Whewell\u2019s\nphilosophy was rediscovered in the 20th century by critics of logical\npositivism. In this entry, I will focus on the most important\nphilosophical aspects of Whewell\u2019s works: his philosophy of\nscience, including his views of induction, confirmation, and necessary\ntruth; his view of the relation between scientific practice, history\nof science, and philosophy of science; and his moral philosophy. His\nview of induction is the most interesting and important part of his\nphilosophy as well as the most often misinterpreted.\n",
