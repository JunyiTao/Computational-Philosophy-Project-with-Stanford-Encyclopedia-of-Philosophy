Higher-Order Perception Theory\n\nAccording to this view, humans not only have first-order\nnon-conceptual and/or analog perceptions of states of their\nenvironments and bodies, they also have second-order non-conceptual\nand/or analog perceptions of their first-order states of perception.\nAnd the most popular version of higher-order perception (HOP) theory\nholds, in addition, that humans (and perhaps other animals) not only\nhave sense-organs that scan the environment/body to produce\nfine-grained representations, but they also have inner senses\nwhich scan the first-order senses (i.e. perceptual experiences) to\nproduce equally fine-grained, but higher-order, representations of\nthose outputs. A version of this view was first proposed by the\nBritish Empiricist philosopher John Locke (1690). In our own time it\nhas been defended especially by Armstrong (1968, 1984) and by Lycan\n(1996, 2004).\n\nA terminological point: \u2018inner-sense theory\u2019\nshould more strictly be called \u2018higher-order-sense\ntheory\u2019, since we of course have senses that are physically\n\u2018inner\u2019, such as pain-perception and internal\ntouch-perception, that aren\u2019t intended to fall under its\nscope. For these are first-order senses on a par with vision and\nhearing, differing only in that their purpose is to detect properties\nof the body, rather than of the external world (Hill 2004). According\nto the sort of higher-order theory that is presently under discussion,\nthese senses, too, will need to have their outputs scanned to produce\nhigher-order analog contents in order for those outputs to become\nphenomenally conscious. In what follows, however, the term\n\u2018inner sense\u2019 will be used to mean, more strictly,\n\u2018higher-order sense\u2019.\n\nWe therefore have the following proposal to consider:\n\nInner-Sense Theory:\n\nA phenomenally conscious mental state is a state with\nanalog/non-conceptual intentional content, which is in turn the target\nof a higher-order analog/non-conceptual intentional state, via the\noperations of a faculty of \u2018inner sense\u2019.\n\n\nOn this account, the difference between a phenomenally conscious\npercept of red and the sort of unconscious percepts of red that guide\nthe guesses of a blindsighter and the activity of the sensorimotor\nsystem, is as follows. The former is scanned by our inner senses to\nproduce a higher-order analog state with the content experience of\nred or seems red, whereas the latter states\naren\u2019t\u2014they remain merely first-order states with the\nanalog content red; and in so remaining, they lack any\ndimension of seeming or subjectivity. According to\ninner-sense theory, it is the higher-order perceptual contents\nproduced by the operations of our inner-senses that make some mental\nstates with analog contents, but not others, available to their\nsubjects. \n\nOne of the main advantages of inner-sense theory is that it can\nexplain how it is possible for us to acquire purely recognitional\nconcepts of experience. For if we possess higher-order perceptual\ncontents, then it should be possible for us to learn to recognize the\noccurrence of our own perceptual states immediately grounded in those\nhigher-order analog contents. (Compare the way in which first-order\nperceptual contents representing color and sound enable us the acquire\nfirst-order recognitional concepts for colors and sounds.) And this\nshould be possible without those recognitional concepts thereby having\nany conceptual connections with our beliefs about the content of the\nstates recognized, nor with any of our surrounding mental\nconcepts. This is then how inner-sense theory will claim to explain\nthe familiar philosophical thought-experiments concerning one\u2019s\nown experiences, which are supposed to cause such problems for\nphysicalist/naturalistic accounts of the mind (Kripke 1972; Chalmers\n1996). (For discussion of this \u2018phenomenal concept\nstrategy\u2019 see Carruthers and Veillet 2007.)\n\nFor example, I can think, \u2018R [an experience as of red]\nmight have occurred in me, or might normally occur in others, in the\nabsence of any of its actual causes and effects.\u2019 So on any view\nof intentional content that sees content as tied to normal causes\n(i.e. to information carried) and/or to normal effects (i.e. to\nteleological or inferential role), experience of type R might\noccur without representing red. Likewise I can think,\n\u2018R might occur in someone without occupying the role of\nexperience, but rather (say) of belief.\u2019 In the same\nsort of way, I shall be able to think, \u2018P [an\nexperience of pain] might have occurred in me, or might occur in\nothers, in the absence of any of the usual causes and effects of pain.\nThere could be someone in whom P experiences occur but who\nisn\u2019t bothered by them, and where those experiences are never caused\nby tissue damage or other forms of bodily insult. And conversely,\nthere could be someone who behaves and acts just as I do when in pain,\nand in response to the same physical causes, but who is never subject\nto P types of experience.\u2019 If we possess purely\nrecognitional concepts of experience such as R and\nP, then the thinkability of such thoughts is unthreatening to\na naturalistic approach to the mind.\n\nInner sense theorists are thus well placed to respond to\nthose who claim that there is an unbridgeable explanatory gap between\nall physical, functional, and intentional facts, on the one hand, and\nthe facts of phenomenal consciousness, on the other (Levine 1983;\nChalmers 1996). And likewise they can explain the conceivability of\nzombies without becoming committed to the existence of any\nnon-physical properties of experience (contra Chalmers 1996).\nIt is the conceptual isolation of our higher-order\nrecognitional concepts of experience that explains how there can be no\na priori entailment between physical, functional, and intentional\nfacts and the occurrence of states of type R or P\n(where R and P express purely recognitional\nconcepts). \n\nInner-sense theory does face a number of difficulties, however. One\nobjection is as follows (see Dretske 1995; G\u00fczeldere 1995). If\ninner-sense theory were true, then how is it that there isn\u2019t any\nphenomenology distinctive of inner sense, in the way that there is a\nphenomenology associated with each outer sense? Since each of the\nouter senses gives rise to a distinctive set of phenomenological\nproperties, one might expect that if there were such a thing\nas inner sense, then there would also be a phenomenology distinctive\nof its operation. But there doesn\u2019t appear to be any.\n\nThis point turns on the so-called \u2018transparency\u2019 of our\nperceptual experience (Harman 1990). Concentrate as hard as you like\non your \u2018outer\u2019 (first-order) experiences\u2014you\nwon\u2019t find any further phenomenological properties\narising out of the attention you pay to them, beyond those already\nbelonging to the contents of the experiences themselves. Paying close\nattention to your experience of the color of the red rose, for\nexample, just produces attention to the redness\u2014a\nproperty of the rose. Put like this, however, the objection just seems\nto beg the question in favor of first-order theories of phenomenal\nconsciousness. It assumes that\nfirst-order\u2014\u2018outer\u2019\u2014perceptions already have a\nphenomenology independently of their targeting by inner sense. But\nthis is just what an inner-sense theorist will deny. And then in order\nto explain the absence of any kind of higher-order phenomenology, an\ninner-sense theorist only needs to maintain that our higher-order\nperceptions are never themselves targeted by an inner-sense-organ\nwhich might produce third-order analog representations of\nthem in turn.\n\nAnother objection to inner-sense theory is as follows (see Sturgeon\n2000). If there really were an organ of inner sense, then it ought to\nbe possible for it to malfunction, just as our first-order senses\nsometimes do. And in that case, it ought to be possible for someone to\nhave a first-order percept with the analog content red\ncausing a higher-order percept with the analog content\nseems-orange. Someone in this situation would be disposed to\njudge, \u2018It\u2019s red\u2019, immediately and non-inferentially (i.e.\nnot influenced by beliefs about the object\u2019s normal color or their own\nphysical state). But at the same time they would be disposed to judge,\n\u2018It seems orange\u2019. Not only does this sort of\nthing never apparently occur, but the idea that it might do so\nconflicts with a powerful intuition. This is that our awareness of our\nown experiences is immediate, in such a way that to\nthink that you are undergoing an experience of a certain\nsort is to be undergoing an experience of that sort. But if\ninner-sense theory is correct, then it ought to be possible for\nsomeone to believe that they are in a state of seeming-orange\nwhen they are actually in a state of seeming-red. (The\nproblem of misrepresentation will addressed further below in sections\n6 and 7.)\n\nA different sort of objection to inner-sense theory is developed by\nCarruthers (2000). It starts from the fact that the internal monitors\npostulated by such theories would need to have considerable\ncomputational complexity in order to generate the requisite\nhigher-order experiences. In order to perceive an experience, the\norganism would need to have mechanisms to generate a set of internal\nrepresentations with an analog or non-conceptual content representing\nthe content of that experience, in all its richness and fine-grained\ndetail. And notice that any inner scanner would have to be a physical\ndevice (just as the visual system itself is) which depends upon the\ndetection of those physical events in the brain that are the\noutputs of the various sensory systems (just as the visual system is a\nphysical device that depends upon detection of physical properties of\nsurfaces via the reflection of light). For it is hard to see how any\ninner scanner could detect the presence of an experience qua\nexperience. Rather, it would have to detect the physical\nrealizations of experiences in the brain, and construct the\nrequisite higher-order representation of the experiences that those\nphysical events realize, on the basis of that physical-information\ninput. This makes it seem inevitable that the scanning device that\nsupposedly generates higher-order experiences of our first-order\nvisual experience would have to be almost as sophisticated and complex\nas the visual system itself.\n\nGiven this complexity in the operations of our organs of inner sense,\nthere should be some plausible story to tell about the evolutionary\npressures that led to their construction (Pinker 1994, 1997). But\nthere would seem to be no such stories on the market. The most\nplausible suggestion is that inner-sense might have evolved to\nsubserve our capacity to think about the mental states of\nconspecifics, thus enabling us to predict their actions and manipulate\ntheir responses. (This is the so-called \u2018Machiavellian\nhypothesis\u2019 to explain the evolution of intelligence in the\ngreat-ape lineage. See Byrne and Whiten 1988, 1998; and see Goldman\n2006, for a view of inner sense of this sort.) But this suggestion\npresupposes that the organism must already have some capacity\nfor higher-order thought, since it is such thoughts that\ninner sense is supposed to subserve. And yet as we shall see shortly\n(in section 5), some higher-order theories can claim all of the\nadvantages of inner-sense theory as an explanation of phenomenal\nconsciousness, but without the need to postulate any \u2018inner\nscanners\u2019. \n\nLycan no longer holds HOP theory (Sauret and Lycan 2014) mainly\nbecause he now thinks that some sort of attention to\nfirst-order states is sufficient for an account of conscious states\nand there is little reason to suppose that the attentional mechanism\nin question is a higher-order representational state (see also Prinz\n2012).\n",
