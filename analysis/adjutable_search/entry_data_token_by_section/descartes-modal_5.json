    "main_text": "Possibility and Human Freedom\n6. Possibility and Human Freedom\n\nThe whole project of the Fourth Meditation would appear to suggest\nthat Descartes is committed to the view that human beings can do\nsomething other than what God preordains. The Fourth Meditation tells\nus that error is avoidable, that we err not as as a result of the way\nthat we are constructed but as a result of our mis-use of one of the\nfaculties that God has provided us, and that to avoid error we must\nrefrain from affirming what we do not perceive clearly and\ndistinctly.\n\nBut there are passages in Descartes\u2019 corpus that make a surface\nreading of the Fourth Meditation problematic. One is of course the\nPrinciples I.40\u201341 text in which Descartes says that\nGod pre-ordains everything from eternity. He does admit that \u201cwe\ncan easily get ourselves into great difficulties if we attempt to\nreconcile this divine preordination with the freedom of our will, or\nattempt to grasp both these things at once\u201d (AT 8A:20, CSM\n1:206). But this just means that he himself appreciates the\nproblem.\n\nThere are other difficult texts as well:\n\n\u2026[P]hilosophy by itself is able to discover that the slightest\nthought could not enter a person\u2019s mind without God\u2019s\nwilling, and having willed from all eternity, that it should so\nenter.\u2026 When Your Highness speaks of the particular providence\nof God as being the foundation of theology, I do not think that you\nhave in mind some change in God\u2019s decrees occasioned by actions\nthat depend on our free will. No such change is theologically tenable;\nand when we are told to pray to God, that is not so that we should\ninform him of our needs, or that we should try to get him to change\nanything in the order established from all eternity by his\nprovidence\u2026[,] but simply to obtain whatever he has from all\neternity, willed to be obtained by our prayers. (\u201cTo Princess\nElisabeth, 6 October 1645,\u201d AT 4:314\u20136, CSMK 272\u201373)\n\n\nThe greater we deem the works of God to be, the better we observe the\ninfinity of his power; and the better known this infinity is to us,\nthe more certain we are that it extends even to the most particular\nactions of human beings. (\u201cTo Princess Elizabeth, 6 October\n1645,\u201d AT 4:315, CSMK 273)\n\n\nAs for free will, I agree that if we think only of ourselves we cannot\nhelp regarding ourselves as independent; but when we think of the\ninfinite power of God, we cannot help believing that all things depend\non him, and hence that our free will is not exempt from this\ndependence. \u2026 The independence which we experience and feel in\nourselves, and which suffices to make our actions praiseworthy or\nblameworthy, is not incompatible with a dependence of quite another\nkind, whereby all things are subject to God. (\u201cTo Princess\nElisabeth, 3 November 1645,\u201d AT 4:332\u20133, CSMK 277)\n\n\nHenceforth, because he [the man who meditates upon God] knows that\nnothing can befall him which God has not decreed, he no longer fears\ndeath, pain or disgrace. He so loves this divine decree, deems it so\njust and so necessary, and knows that he must be so completely subject\nto it that even when he expects it to bring death or some other evil,\nhe would not will to change it even if, per impossible, he\ncould do so. (\u201cTo Chanut, 1 February 1647,\u201d AT 4:609, CSMK\n310)\n\n\nIn the Principles I.40\u201341 discussion, Descartes appeals\nto divine incomprehensibility to make sense of how human freedom and\ndivine preordination are to be reconciled. God is infinitely powerful,\nand He somehow made a universe in which it is true both that human\nbeings are free and that God has preordained everything from eternity\n(AT 8A:20, CSM 1:206). Perhaps we should just assume that Descartes\nthinks that human freedom is inconsistent with divine pre-ordination\nand that we cannot make sense of human freedom (except by appeal to\ndivine incomprehensibility).\n\nAnother interpretive option is to emphasize that in\nPrinciples 1.40\u201341 Descartes is saying only that our\nexperience of freedom and independence is in tension with divine\npre-ordination (Cunning 2010, 138\u201342). There is a way in which\nour experience of freedom is perfectly consistent with divine\npre-ordination, of course, if God has immutably decreed all of our\nmental life for all eternity and if our mental life includes some\nexperiences and not others. But it might seem puzzling why we have an\nexperience of freedom at all. Still, if Descartes allows that human\nfreedom itself is consistent with divine pre-ordination, then he is\nnot a libertarian but a compatibilist.\n\nPassages outside of the Meditations might be easily read as\nconsistent with the view that for Descartes there does not exist any\nunactualized possible reality, but the view appears not to square with\nmany of the claims of the Fourth Meditation. The Meditation does\ncontain compatibilist-sounding claims \u2013 for example, that the\nwill is maximally free when it is compelled to affirm truth (AT 7:58,\nCSM 2:40); that it would be impossible for us to be in a state of\nindifference if we had distinct perceptions only (ibid.); and\nthat assent and dissent are a matter of the will being pulled and\ncompelled by reasons (AT 7:59; CSM 2:41). However, the whole point of\nthe Fourth Meditation would seem to be that God is imperfect if our\nerrors (and false affirmations) are inevitable, and thus that on any\ngiven occasion it is always possible for us to affirm or deny. In a\nrecent book, C.P. Ragland reasons along these lines \u2013 he argues\nthat the Fourth Meditation supposes a view of freedom according to\nwhich a finite mind has a two-way libertarian power to affirm or not\naffirm in cases where its perception is not clear and distinct.\nOtherwise, it is not clear what the sense is in which finite minds\nwould have the power to avoid error, or what the sense is in which\nerror would be on us and not on God (Ragland 2016,77\u201381, 234).\nRagland points to a number of other passages in defense of his\nlibertarian interpretation. One is Principles I.37, in which\nDescartes says that\n\nit is a supreme perfection in man that he acts voluntarily, that is,\nfreely; this makes him in a special way the author of his actions and\ndeserving of praise for what he does. We do not praise automatons for\naccurately producing all the movements they were designed to perform\n\u2026 when we embrace the truth, our doing so voluntarily is much\nmore to our credit than would be the case if we could not do\notherwise. (CSM 1:205)\n\n\nThis passage as quoted is strongly suggestive of the libertarian\nreading, especially the bit at the end, but there is actually an issue\nof translation that needs to be addressed. A more literal translation\nof the last clause \u2013 \u201c\u2026 quam si non possemus non\namplecti\u201d (AT 8A:18) \u2013 is \u201c\u2026 than if we were\nnot able to not embrace it.\u201d This latter language is in fact\nsimilar to the language in the Fourth Meditation, where Descartes\nsounds quite compatibilist. He says in the Fourth Meditation that\n\u201cthe will consists simply in our ability to do or not do\nsomething\u201d (CSM 2:40), but he also says in the same breath that\nour will is free in cases where it is irresistibly compelled to affirm\na clearly and distinctly perceived truth. The will does not possess a\ntwo-way power in such instances, but it still consists in an ability\nto do or not do. That is to say, the will has in its arsenal a\ncapacity to affirm and a capacity to deny, but not a two-way\ncontra-causal power. Ragland would presumably respond to the\ntranslational concerns about Principles I.37 by saying that\nthere is a larger and more pressing philosophical concern: that\nDescartes holds that volitions are praiseworthy, but volitions cannot\nbe said to be praiseworthy if they could not be otherwise (Ragland,\n61\u201362, 77\u201378). However, we might present the same concern\nback to the libertarian: if a volition is a modification of a mental\nsubstance, and it materializes in that substance without a prior\nmodification as its cause, volitions would seem to pop into existence\nfrom nowhere, and the will instead would be a loose cannon. Perhaps\nRagland might respond here by introducing the notion of agent\ncausation and saying that, for Descartes, a mental substance itself is\nable to generate a volition, and not as a result of the activity of\nany of its modes. However, there are tremendous difficulties in trying\nto make sense of how agent causation would work in a substance-mode\nontology. If we imagined a substance with no modes whatsoever \u2013\nin line with the thought experiment that Spinoza presents in Short\nTreatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being (84) \u2013 it is\ndifficult to make any sense at all of the process by which a volition\nwould form in that substance. If the substance has no modes, but then\nit all of a sudden had a volition, there would be no reason why it\nformed that particular volition rather than some other, and there\nwould be no reason why it formed the volition at that particular\nmoment and not at a different moment. If we do start positing reasons,\nin terms of some specific underlying mental activity that was brewing\nbeforehand and was a precursor to the volition, we could then think\nabout the case of two qualitatively identical substances that both\nhave that same underlying activity and a lot more activity besides. If\nboth substances are identical and have all of the same modes, we could\nask if a volition could occur in one that did not occur in the other.\nBut the same set of concerns would seem to arise. There would be no\nreason for the volition to appear, in which case it would again be\nrandom, and the notion of accountability for volitions would make\nlittle sense.\n\nA compatibilist reading of the Fourth Meditation resolution of the\nproblem of error would have to emphasize the following: that the\nMeditation provides reasons that push and compel the will to refrain\nfrom affirming perceptions that are not clear and distinct; that the\nMeditation speaks of the will as being pushed and pulled by reasons\nthat are presented to it (CSM 2:40\u201341); and that Descartes\ninsists that upon further reflection \u2013 reflection which occurs\npast the Meditations \u2013 it is clear that the entirety of\nour mental lives depends on God\u2019s eternal and immutable will and\nthat, as a result, nothing that happens (including pain and death, and\npresumably error) is bad; and that something (like error) can be the\noutcome of God\u2019s will if we just understand it in its full\ncontext. In the Sixth Meditation, Descartes offers a similar theodicy\nto explain the occurrence of misleading sensations \u2013 for\nexample, the feeling of a pain in a part of the body that has been\namputated. Descartes argues there that if we are going to have a body,\nthings like that will sometimes happen; they are just part of the\nterritory for a mind that is embodied, and for reasons that are not\nentirely clear to us, it is better to be embodied than not (CSM\n2:57\u201361). The Fourth Meditation theodicy might be exactly\nparallel. If we had just a will or just an intellect, we would never\nerr, but there are advantages to having both. When the two are brought\ntogether, however, the intellect sometimes pushes and pulls the will\nto affirm or deny. A finite intellect has limited information, and\nsome of the affirmations that it compels the will to make will not\nconform exactly to reality, but it is better that we have both than\nthat we have just one. Furthermore, we can trust that \u201cinsofar\nas these acts depend on God, they are wholly true and good\u201d (CSM\n2:42), and so perhaps there is a perspective from which even our\nerroneous affirmation are getting at truth, in an incomplete manner,\nor just confusedly.\n\nA final problem for the view that Descartes subscribes to a\nlibertarian conception of freedom is that in the end it is required to\nappeal to a doctrine of divine incomprehensibility to explain how\ndivine providence and foreknowledge are consistent with libertarian\nfreedom. Ragland does this (Ragland 2016, 230\u2013235), as does Wee\n(in Wee 2014, 199\u2013200). We do not need to force Descartes to\nappeal to divine incomprehensibility if we interpret him as a\ncompatibilist, and as we have seen we could save him from additional\ntrouble as well. It is one thing for a philosopher to appeal to divine\nincomprehensibility in a case in which there are two truths that are\nin tension, or a case in which a truth is mysterious in the face of\nother truths, but it is an entirely different thing for a philosopher\nto appeal to divine incomprehensibility after positing a logical\ncontradiction. Descartes does not do that anywhere, and for good\nreason. He does appeal to divine incomprehensibility in the course of\ntrying to understand why we would have an experience of\nindependence if God has preordained everything from eternity, and that\nexperience is mysterious indeed, but Descartes does not say anywhere\nthat freedom itself is inconsistent with divine preordination. As we\nhave seen, however, in one passage he speaks of the\n\nindependence which we experience in ourselves, and which suffices to\nmake our actions praiseworthy or blameworthy, [and which] is not\nincompatible with a dependence of quite another kind, whereby all\nthings are subject to God. (CSMK 277; also Ragland, 212)\n\n\nA final issue to consider in the context of discussing\nDescartes\u2019 view on human freedom is the issue of the extent to\nwhich finite minds are compelled or drawn to affirm clear and distinct\nperceptions. There are a number of texts in which Descartes reflects\nthat view that finite minds are wholly unable to refrain from\naffirming a clear and distinct\n perception.[38]\n Indeed, we might think that the only way that we would be able to\nknow that God\u2019s non-deceiverhood secures the truth of clear and\ndistinct perceptions is if those perceptions are utterly compelled.\nThere are passages, however, in which Descartes appears to reflect the\nview that it is within the power of the will to refrain from affirming\na clear and distinct perception. One is Principles I.37, in\nwhich Descartes says that \u201cwhen we embrace the truth, our doing\nso voluntarily is much more to our credit than would be the case if we\ncould not do otherwise\u201d (AT 8A:19, CSM 1:205). But this passage\nis especially odd given that only a few lines later in\nPrinciples I.43 Descartes offers one of his statements of the\nview that we are unable to doubt clear and distinct perceptions (in\nwhich we are embracing the\n truth\u2026).[39]\n\nAnother passage in which Descartes appears to reflect the view that it\nis within the power of a finite will to refrain from affirming a clear\nand distinct perception is in \u201cTo [Mesland], 9 February\n1645.\u201d There Descartes writes that\n\nabsolutely speaking\u2026 it is always open to us to hold back from\npursuing a clearly known good, or from admitting a clearly perceived\ntruth, provided we consider it a good thing to demonstrate the freedom\nof our will by so doing. (AT 4:173, CSMK 245)\n\n\nAn examination of the larger context of this passage in the shows that\nit is not in fact evidence that Descartes holds that it is within the\npower of a finite will to refrain from affirming a clear and distinct\nperception. In the previous letter to Mesland Descartes had said\nthat\n\nI agree with you when you say that we can suspend our judgment; but I\ntried to explain in what manner this can be done. For it seems to me\ncertain that a great light in the intellect is followed by a great\ninclination in the will; so that if we see very clearly that a thing\nis good for us, it is very difficult \u2013 and on my view\nimpossible, as long as one continues in the same thought \u2013 to\nstop the course of our desire. \u201cTo [Mesland], 2 May 1644,\u201d\nAT 4:115\u20136, CSMK 233)\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 view that clear and distinct perceptions are\nwill-compelling is the view that so long as the intellect has a clear\nand distinct idea, it is impossible for the will to refrain from\naffirming it. What it is for a finite mind to clearly and distinctly\nperceive X is for its intellect to have a clear and distinct\nidea of X and for its will to affirm X, but while the\nintellect is presenting this clear and distinct idea, the will cannot\nstop affirming it to turn its attention to something else. Instead,\nanother idea must be put in place of the clear and distinct idea, and\nby something other than the\n will.[40]\n As Descartes says by way of qualification in the February 1645\nletter, we suspend judgment when something else distracts the will\nfrom a clear and distinct idea (AT 4:173, CSMK 245) \u2013 for\nexample the desire to exhibit our freedom (Nelson 1997,\n163\u201364).\n\nIt is tempting to assume that Descartes accepts the Spinozistic view\nthat the will is at the mercy of the clarity with which the intellect\nhas ideas. (Of course, in Spinoza\u2019s language the view is that\nthere is no distinction between will and intellect and that to the\nextent that we understand something our will is drawn to affirm it.)\nDescartes appears to accept this view in the case of clear and\ndistinct ideas at least, and it would make sense for him to think that\nthe compellingness of truth and goodness does not disappear when our\ngrasp of it is slightly weakened. But such a reading is speculative at\nbest.\n\nA final passage to consider is in The Passions of the Soul\nI.41. There Descartes says that \u201cthe will is by its nature so\nfree that it can never be constrained\u201d (AT 11:359, CSM 1:343).\nThis passage might appear to reflect a libertarian view of freedom,\nbut there is a multitude of passages in which Descartes says that the\neternal and immutable divine decree reaches down to \u201cthe most\nparticular actions of human beings\u201d (AT 4:315, CSMK 273) and to\n\u201canything\u2026 we could ever do\u201d (Principles\nI.40, AT 8A:20, CSM 1:206). On a natural reading of the\nPassions I.41 passage, Descartes is highlighting that a will\nby its nature is free and unconstrained, but that it is not free and\nunconstrained when its nature is adulterated \u2013 for example when\nit is attached to a body. In the same vein we might say that a diamond\nis by its nature beautiful, but that it is not beautiful when it is\nencrusted in dirt (Cunning 2023, 229\u2013230, 250\u2013257). As per\nthe Fourth Meditation, a will is free not when it is indifferent but\nwhen it affirms utterly compelling clear and distinct perceptions, and\na mind that is unencumbered by a body has clear and distinct\nperceptions only (Fifth Replies, AT 7:375, CSM 2:258;\nSecond Replies, AT 7:130\u2013131, CSM 2:94).\n",
