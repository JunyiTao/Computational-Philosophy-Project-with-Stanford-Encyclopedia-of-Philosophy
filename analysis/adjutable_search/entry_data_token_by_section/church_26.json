    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Church\u2019s Modest Realism\n6.3 Realism about Propositions\n\nThe notion of proposition that Church argued must be\npostulated by semantics is the \u201cabstract notion\u201d:\n\n\nindependent alike of any particular expression in words and of any\nparticular psychological act of judgment or conception\u2014not the\nparticular declarative sentence, but the content or meaning which is\ncommon to the sentence and its translation into another\nlanguage\u2014not the particular judgment, but the objective content\nof the judgment, which is capable of being the common property of\nmany. (1956\u201372 [BE: 742])\n\n\nChurch credited Leibniz with an important argument that goes some way\nto establishing the need for this notion in semantics. The argument,\nas reported by Church (1956b), is as follows:\n\nTruth cannot attach to actual particular thoughts\n(cogitationes) or particular acts of judgment, since what is\nthought or judged by no one may nevertheless be true. Perhaps, then,\ntruth attaches to things (res) rather than particular\nthoughts. However, falsehood cannot attach to things, only to\nthoughts. In which case, if truth attaches to things and falsehood\nattaches to thoughts, then we cannot say that the same subject might\nbe true or false. Leibniz\u2019s way out, as reported by Church, is\nthat truth and falsehood attach to possible thoughts. This is\nthe notion that Church considered an important step towards the\nabstract notion of a proposition.\n\nChurch (1956b) noted that instead of making the final step from\npossible thoughts to propositions, we might claim that truth and\nfalsehood attach to possible sentences of some\nlanguage\u2014those that the syntactical rules of the language allow\nas well formed. He added that this move won\u2019t serve the\nnominalist like Goodman\u2014who denies propositions because they are\nabstract\u2014since the move also invokes abstract types. Further,\nand for the reasons discussed in\n \u00a73.3,\n if we abandon nominalism but continue to limit our ontology to\npossible sentences, then our semantic theory will provide a false\nanalysis of attributions of assertion and belief.\n\nChurch (1956b) also considered rejecting the first line of argument\nand insisting that truth and falsehood do attach only to\nactual particular thoughts or sentences. In that case, he argued, we\nwould be limited to those things that we could actually think or say\nin a reasonable amount of time. In which case, there would no longer\nbe a distinction between statements that are unproved because of human\nlimitations and those that are unprovable as a matter of\nmathematical necessity.\n\nMoreover, Church pointed out that those who are willing to accept\nthese limitations must, at the very best, face an excessively\ncomplicated theory of syntax and semantics (one that, for example,\nwould have to be formulated without the notion of an infinite\nsequence):\n\n\nIndeed the justification would seem to be basically the same for\nextended physical objects in macrophysical theory and for ideal\nsentences in logical syntax: both are postulated entities\u2014some\nmay prefer to say inferred entities\u2014without which the theory\nwould be intolerably complex if not impossible. (1956b [BE:\n359\u201360])\n\n\nReturning to Leibniz\u2019s dialogue, Church pointed out that it\ncontained an important assumption about logical form (which Church\naccepted): that there is some thing\u2014whether a thought\nor another kind of thing\u2014that is the logical subject of\nattributions of truth and falsehood as well as the logical object of\nattributions of assertion and belief, including attributions\ncontaining bound variables such as \u201cthere is something that\nChurch asserts and Goodman denies\u201d. Church was scathingly\ncritical of those (like Goodman) who denied this assumption without\nalso providing, in sufficient detail, their own corresponding analyses\nof attributions of assertion and belief. Church (1956b; 1973) noted\nthat Scheffler (1954) was almost alone in offering such an analysis\nand defended the assumption by submitting Scheffler\u2019s proposal\nto extensive criticism. Especially puzzling to Church was\nScheffler\u2019s willingness to admit that there is a philosophical\nproblem about the existence of physical objects while also insisting,\nwithout argument, that there is a problem about the existence of\npropositions and sentence types that is different in kind.\n\nIn sum, Church\u2019s argument for the existence of propositions is\nas follows. (1) Actual thought or sentence tokens, as well as possible\nsentences, are insufficient for semantics to be a true and humanly\nunderstandable theory. Rather, (2) propositions are also needed.\nFurther, by Church\u2019s criterion of ontological commitment, (3) if\nentities of kind \\(K\\) are entailed by a true theory, then there exist\nentities of kind \\(K\\). So, (4) there exist propositions. Church\n(1952, 1958a) chides Ayer and Ryle for not taking this last step, that\nis for inadvertently committing themselves to propositions while\ntalking about propositional attitudes but denying their existence\nwhile talking explicitly about propositions as theoretical\ncommitments.\n\nRegarding the second premise, it remains to be shown that we need to\ntake the step from the notion of a possible\nthought\u2014which is abstracted from the notion of a possible\nmind that is capable of error and so of thinking something\nfalse\u2014to the notion of an abstract proposition. Church\nattributed the discovery of the latter notion to both Bolzano and\nFrege (Church 1943a; 1956a,b). However, Church did not endorse\nBolzano\u2019s arguments so much as his conclusion. (For the\nargument, see\n \u00a73.3 of the entry on Bolzano.)\n And as for Frege, Church simply reiterated his remarks about the\nobjectivity, mind and language independence, and publicity of\nGedanke, without telling us exactly why possible thoughts are\nnot also objective, mind-and-language-independent, abstract and\npublic. Perhaps the issue is that the existence of possible thoughts\ndepends on the existence of possible minds, whereas propositions, such\nas that two and two are four, do not depend on the existence\nof possible minds, since, intuitively, they would be true if there\nwere no minds at all. Arguably, then, the notion of an abstract\nproposition must be postulated by and so is an ontological commitment\nof a theory that can explain the foregoing intuition.\n",
