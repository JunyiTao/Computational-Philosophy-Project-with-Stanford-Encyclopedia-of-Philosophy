    "main_text": "\n\nThe idea of the social contract goes back at least to Protagoras and\nEpicurus. In its recognizably modern form, however, the idea is\nrevived by Thomas Hobbes and was later developed, in different ways,\nby John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. After Kant,\nthe idea fell out of favor with political philosophers until it was\nresurrected by John Rawls. It is now at the heart of the work of a\nnumber of moral and political philosophers.\n\nThe basic idea seems simple: in some way, the agreement of all\nindividuals subject to collectively enforced social arrangements shows\nthat those arrangements have some normative property (they are\nlegitimate, just, obligating, etc.). Even this basic idea, though, is\nanything but simple, and even this abstract rendering is objectionable\nin many ways.\n\nTo explicate the idea of the social contract we analyze contractual\napproaches into five elements: (1) the role of the social contract (2)\nthe parties (3) agreement (4) the object of agreement (5) what the\nagreement is supposed to show.\n",
