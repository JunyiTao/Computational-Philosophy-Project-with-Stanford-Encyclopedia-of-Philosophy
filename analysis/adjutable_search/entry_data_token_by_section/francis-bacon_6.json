Scientific Method: Novum Organum and the Theory of Induction\n\n\nAlready in his early text Cogitata et Visa (1607) Bacon\ndealt with his scientific method, which became famous under the name of\ninduction. He repudiates the syllogistic method and defines\nhis alternative procedure as one \u201cwhich by slow and faithful toil\ngathers information from things and brings it into understanding\u201d\n(Farrington 1964, 89). When later on he developed his method in\ndetail, namely in his Novum Organum (1620), he still noted\nthat \n\n[of] induction the logicians seem hardly to have taken any\nserious thought, but they pass it by with a slight notice, and hasten\nto the formulae of disputation. I on the contrary reject demonstration\nby syllogism \u2026. (Bacon IV [1901], 24)\n\n\nBacon's method appears as his conceptual plot, \n applied to all stages of knowledge, and at every phase\nthe whole process has to be kept in mind. (Malherbe 1996, 76)\n\nInduction implies ascending to axioms, as well as a descending to\nworks, so that from axioms new particulars are gained and from these\nnew axioms. The inductive method starts from sensible experience and\nmoves via natural history (providing sense-data as guarantees) to\nlower axioms or propositions, which are derived from the tables of\npresentation or from the abstraction of notions. Bacon does not\nidentify experience with everyday experience, but presupposes that\nmethod corrects and extends sense-data into facts, which go together\nwith his setting up of tables (tables of presence and of absence and\ntables of comparison or of degrees, i.e., degrees of absence or\npresence). \u201cBacon's antipathy to simple enumeration as the\nuniversal method of science derived, first of all, from his preference\nfor theories that deal with interior physical causes, which are not\nimmediately observable\u201d (Urbach 1987, 30; see: sect. 2).  The\nlast type can be supplemented by tables of counter-instances, which\nmay suggest experiments: \n To move from the sensible to the real requires the\ncorrection of the senses, the tables of natural history, the\nabstraction of propositions and the induction of notions. In other\nwords, the full carrying out of the inductive method is\nneeded. (Malherbe 1996, 85)\n\n\nThe sequence of methodical steps does not, however, end here,\nbecause Bacon assumes that from lower axioms more general ones can be\nderived (by induction). The complete process must be understood as the\njoining of the parts into a systematic chain. From the more general\naxioms Bacon strives to reach more fundamental laws of nature\n(knowledge of forms), which lead to practical deductions as new\nexperiments or works (IV, 24\u20135). The decisive instruments in this\nprocess are the middle or \u2018living axioms,\u2019 which mediate\nbetween particulars and general axioms. For Bacon, induction can only\nbe efficient if it is eliminative by exclusion, which goes beyond the\nremit of induction by simple enumeration. The inductive method helps\nthe human mind to find a way to ascertain truthful knowledge.\n\nNovum Organum, I, Aphorism CXV (Bacon IV [1901], 103) ends\nthe \u201cpulling down\u201d of \u201cthe signs and causes of the\nerrors\u201d within the sciences, achieved by means of three\nrefutations, which constituted the condition for a rational\nintroduction of method: refutation of \u2018natural human\nreason\u2019 (idols); refutation of \u2018demonstrations\u2019\n(syllogisms) and refutation of \u2018theories\u2019 (traditional\nphilosophical systems).\n\n\nThe Second Part of the Novum Organum deals with\nBacon's rule for interpreting nature, even if he provides no\ncomplete or universal theory. He contributes to the new philosophy by\nintroducing his tables of discovery (Inst.\nMagna, IV), by presenting an example of particulars\n(Inst. Magna, II), and by observations on history\n(Inst. Magna, III). It is well known that he worked\nhard in the last five years of his life to make progress on his natural\nhistory, knowing that he could not always come up to the standards of\nlegitimate interpretation.\n\n\nBacon's method presupposes a double starting-point: empirical\nand rational. True knowledge is acquired if we want to proceed from a\nlower certainty to a higher liberty and from a lower liberty to a\nhigher certainty. The rule of certainty and liberty in Bacon converges\nwith his repudiation of the old logic of Aristotle, which determined\ntrue propositions by the criteria of generality, essentiality, and\nuniversality. Bacon rejects anticipatio naturae\n(\u201canticipation of nature\u201d) in favor of interpretatio\nnaturae (\u201cinterpretation of nature\u201d), which starts\nwith the collecting of facts and their methodical (inductive)\ninvestigation, shunning entanglement in pure taxonomy (as in Ramism),\nwhich establishes the order of things (Urbach 1987, 26; see also \nFoucault 1966 [1970]), but does not produce knowledge. For\nBacon, making is knowing and knowing is making (Bacon IV [1901],\n109\u201310). In accordance with the maxim \u201ccommand nature\n\u2026 by obeying her\u201d (Sessions 1996, 136; Gaukroger 2001,\n139ff.), the exclusion of superstition, imposture, error, and\nconfusion are obligatory. Bacon introduces variations into \u201cthe\nmaker's knowledge tradition\u201d as the discovery of the forms\nof a given nature lead him to develop his method for acquiring factual\nand proven knowledge.\n\n\nBacon argues against \u201canticipation of nature\u201d, which he\nregards as a conservative method, leading to theories that recapitulate\nthe data without producing new ones conducive to the growth of\nknowledge. Moreover, such theories are considered to be final, so that\nthey are never replaced.\n\n\n\u201cAnticipation of nature\u201d resembles\n\u201cconventionalism\u201d (Urbach 1987, 30\u201341), according to\nwhich theories refer to unobservable entities (e.g., atoms, epicycles).\nThe theories are \u201ccomputation rules\u201d or \u201cinference\nlicences\u201d within this given framework, which give explanations\nand predictions of particular kinds of observable events. The\nconventionalist acceptance of making predictions concerning future\nevents cannot be separated from the question of probability.\nBacon's procedure of knowledge acquisition goes against\n\u201cconventionalism\u201d, because \u201canticipation of\nnature\u201d does not reject authoritative and final speculations\nconcerning \u201cunobservables\u201d and because it permits \u201cad\nhoc adjustments\u201d.  Nowadays, however,\n philosophers would not accept the idea that just\nbecause we can't observe something directly \u2026 it follows that\nthere is no such thing. (Huggett 2010, 82. See also Von\nWeizs\u00e4cker and Juilfs 1958, pp.67\u201370; Rae 1986 [2000], 1\u201327\nand passim)\n\n\nConventionalist deep-level theories of the world are chosen from among\nalternative ways of observing phenomena. Although theories revealing\nthe world structure are not directly provable or disprovable by means\nof observation or experiment, conventionalists might maintain their\nchosen theory even in the face of counter-evidence. They therefore\navoid changes of theory. Any move to a new theory is not taken on the\nbasis of new evidence, but because a new theory seems to be simpler,\nmore applicable or more beautiful. Laws of nature are generally\nunderstood as being unrevisable (O'Hear 1995, 165).  The famous\ndebate, sparked by Thomas Kuhn, on paradigmatic and non-paradigmatic\nscience and theory is relevant here. Bacon's position\u2014open to\nscientific progress\u2014is nearer to Kuhn than to Duhem or\nPoincar\u00e9. For Bacon, \u201canticipation of nature\u201d (as\na mode of \u201cconventionalism\u201d) produces obstacles to the\nprogress of knowledge. Traditional methods shun speculation concerning\nthings which are not immediately visible; Bacon's speculation,\nhowever, is an element of \u201cinterpretation of nature\u201d. He\npresupposes hypothetical theories, but these do not go beyond the\ncollected data. His acceptance of hypotheses is connected with his\nrejection of\n\u201canticipation of nature\u201d. Thus, hypotheses are\nrelated to the axioms of \u201cinterpretation of nature\u201d, which\ngo beyond the original data. The amount of established facts is not\nidentical with that of possible data (Gillies 1998, 307).\nAnticipation is rejected, only if it \u201cflies from the senses and\nparticulars to the most general axioms\u201d (OFB XI, xxv). \nBecause of the dangers of premature generalization, Bacon is careful\nabout speculations and rigorously rejects any dogmatic defense of them\nand the tendency to declare them infallible.\n\n\n\u2026the philosophy that we now possess clutches to its breast\ncertain tenets with which (if we look into it carefully) they want\nwholly to conceive men that nothing difficult, nothing with real power\nand influence over nature, should be expected from art or human\neffort; [\u2026] These things, if we examine them minutely, tend\nwholly towards a wicked circumscription of human power and an\nintentional and unnatural despair which not only confounds the\npresages of hope but breaks every nerve and spur of industry, and\nthrows away the chances afforded by experience itself\u2014while all\nthey care about is that their art be considered perfect, expending\ntheir effort to achieve the most foolish and bankrupt glory of having\nit believed that whatever has not been found out or understood so far\ncannot be found out or understood in the future. (OFB XI,\n141) \n\nBacon sees nature as an extremely subtle complexity, which affords all\nthe energy of the natural philosopher to disclose her secrets.\n\n\nFor him, new axioms must be larger and wider than the\nmaterial from which they are taken. At the same time,\n\u201cinterpretation of nature\u201d must not leap to remote axioms.\nIn terms of his method, he rejects general ideas as simple\nabstractions from very few sense perceptions. Such abstract words may\nfunction as conventions for organizing \u201cnew observations\u201d,\nbut only in the sense of means for taxonomical order. Such a sterile\nprocedure is irrelevant for \u201cinterpretation of nature\u201d,\nwhich is not final or infallible and is based on the insight that\nconfirming hypotheses do not provide strict proofs. Bacon's method is\ntherefore characterized by openness: \n\nNevertheless, I do not\naffirm that nothing can be added to what I prescribe; on the contrary,\nas one who observes the mind not only in its innate capacity but also\ninsofar as it gets to grips with things, it is my conviction that the\nart of discovering will grow as the number of things discovered will\ngrow. (OFB, XI, 197)\n\nPeter Urbach's commentary exactly underlines Bacon's openness:\n\n He believed that theories\nshould be advanced to explain whatever data were available in a\nparticular domain. These theories should preferably concern the\nunderlying physical, causal mechanisms and ought, in any case, to go\nbeyond the data which generated them. They are then tested by drawing\nout new predictions, which, if verified in experience, may confirm the\ntheory and may eventually render it certain, at least in the sense that\nit becomes very difficult to deny. (Urbach 1987, 49) \n\nBacon was no seventeenth-century Popperian. Rather, on account of his\ntheory of induction, he was:\n\nthe first great theorist of experimentalism\u201d: \u201cthe\nfunction of experiment was both to test theories and to establish\nfacts\u201d (Rees, in OFB XI, xli). \n\nEncyclopaedic repetition with an Aristotelian slant is being displaced\nby original compilation in which deference to authority plays no part\nwhatever. Individual erudition is being dumped in favour of collective\nresearch. Conservation of traditional knowledge is being discarded in\nthe interest of a new, functional realization of natural\nhistory, which demands that\nlegenda\u2014things worth reading\u2014be supplanted by\nmaterials which will form the basis of a thoroughgoing attempt to\nimprove the material conditions of the human race. (Rees, in OFB\nXI, xlii)\n\n\n\nForm is for Bacon a structural constituent of a natural entity or a\nkey to its truth and operation, so that it comes near to natural law,\nwithout being reducible to causality. This appears all the more\nimportant, since Bacon\u2014who seeks out exclusively causes which\nare necessary and sufficient for their effects\u2014rejects\nAristotle's four causes (his four types of explanation for a complete\nunderstanding of a phenomenon) on the grounds that the distribution\ninto material, formal, efficient, and final causes does not work well\nand that they fail to advance the sciences (especially the final,\nefficient, and material causes). Consider again the passage\nquoted in Section 3.3: \n There are and can be only two ways of searching into\nand discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars\nto the most general axioms, and from these principles, the truth of\nwhich it takes for settled and immovable, proceeds to judgment and to\nthe discovery of middle axioms.  And this way is now in fashion. The\nother derives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by a\ngradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general\naxioms at last. This is the true way, but as yet untried. (Bacon IV\n[1901], 50: Novum Organum, I, Aphorism XIX).\n\n\nSince for Bacon the formal necessity of the syllogism does not\nsuffice to set up first principles, his method comprises two basic\ntasks: (1) the discovery of forms, and (2) the transformation of\nconcrete bodies. The discovery from every case of generation and motion\nrefers to a latent process according to which efficient and material\ncauses lead to forms; but there is also the discovery of latent\nconfigurations of bodies at rest and not in motion (Bacon IV [1901],\n119\u201320).\n\n\nBacon's new mode of using human understanding implies a\nparallelism between striving towards human power and constituting human\nknowledge. Technical know-how leads to successful operations, which\nconverge with the discovery of forms (P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988, 108;\nBacon IV [1901], 121). To understand the workings of nature\npresupposes an arrangement of facts which makes the investigative\nanalysis of cause and effect possible, especially by means of new\nexperiments. At this point the idea of scientia\noperativa comes in again, since the direction for a true and\nperfect rule of operation is parallel to the discovery of a true form.\nBacon's specific non-Aristotelian Aristotelianism\n(P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988, 113, 115) is one of the main features of his\ntheory. Other indispensable influences on Bacon, apart from a modified\nversion of Aristotle, are critically assessed Hermeticism, rhetoric\n(Vickers) and alchemy (Rees).\n\n\nTwo kinds of axioms correspond to the following division of\nphilosophy and the sciences: the investigation of forms or\nmetaphysics; and the investigation of efficient cause and\nmatter, which leads to the latent process and configuration in\nphysics. Physics itself is split up by Bacon into\nMechanics, i.e., the practical, and Magic, i.e., the\nmetaphysical.\n\n\nNowadays the view that Bacon \u201cmade little first-hand\ncontribution to science\u201d (Hesse 1964, 152) no longer coincides\nwith the opinion that we have to assume an underestimation of the\n\u201cplace of hypothesis and mathematics\u201d in his work (Urban\n1987; Sessions 1999, 139; Rees 1986). But there were few doubts in\nthe past that Bacon \u201cencouraged detailed and methodical\nexperimentation\u201d (Hesse 1964, 152); and he did this on account\nof his new inductive method, which implied the need for negative\ninstances and refuting experiments. Bacon saw that confirming instances\ncould not suffice to analyze the structure of scientific laws, since\nthis task presupposed a hypothetical-deductive system, which, according\nto Lisa Jardine, is closely connected to \u201cthe logical and\nlinguistic backgrounds from which Bacon's New Logic proceeds\n\u2026\u201d (Sessions 1999, 140; Jardine 1974, 69ff.).\n\n\nBacon's interpretation of nature uses \u201cTables\nand Arrangements of Instances\u201d concerning the natural phenomena\nunder investigation, which function as a necessary condition for\ncracking the code of efficient causation. His prerogative\ninstances are not examples or phenomena simply taken from nature\nbut rather imply information with inductive potential which show\npriority conducive to knowledge or to methodological relevance when\ninserted into tables. The instances do not represent the order of\nsensible things, but instead express the order of qualities (natures).\nThese qualities provide the working basis for the order of abstract\nnatures. Bacon's tables have a double function: they are\nimportant for natural history, collecting the data on bodies\nand virtues in nature; and they are also indispensable for\ninduction, which makes use of these data.\n\n\nAlready in Temporis Partus Masculus (1603) Bacon had\ndisplayed a \u201cfacility of shrewd observation\u201d (Sessions\n1999, 60) concerning his ideas on induction. In his Novum\nOrganum the nature of all human science and knowledge was seen by\nhim as proceeding most safely by negation and exclusion, as opposed to\naffirmation and inclusion. Even in his early tracts it was clear to\nBacon that he had to seek a method of discovering the right forms, the\nmost well known of which was heat (Novum Organum II,\nAph. XI\u2013XII) or \u201cthe famous trial investigation of the form\nof heat\u201d (Rees 2000, 66; see Bacon IV [1901], 154\u20135).\n\n\nIn his \u201c[m]ethod of analysis by exclusion\u201d (Sessions\n1999, 141), negation proved to be \u201cone of Bacon's strongest\ncontributions to modern scientific method\u201d (Wright 1951, 152).\nMost important were his tables of degrees and of exclusion. They were\nneeded for the discovery of causes, especially for supreme causes,\nwhich were called forms. The method of induction works in two\nstages:\n\nLearned experience from the known to the unknown has to be\nacquired, and the tables (of presence, absence, degrees) have to be set\nup before their interpretation can take place according to the\nprinciple of exclusion. After the three tables of the first\npresentation have been judged and analyzed, Bacon declares the\nFirst Vintage or the first version of the interpretation of\nnature to be concluded.\nThe second phase of the method concentrates on the process of\nexclusion. The aim of this procedure is the reduction of the empirical\ncharacter of experience, so that the analysis converges with an anatomy\nof things. Here, too, tables of presence and of absence are set up. The\nresearch work proper consists of finding the relationship of the two\nnatures of qualities. Here exclusion functions as the process of\ndetermination. Bacon's method starts from material determination\nin order to establish the formal determination of real causes, but does\nnot stop there, because it aims at the progressive generalization of\ncauses. Here, again, the central element of the inductive method is the\nprocedure of exclusion.\n\n\n\nForms, as the final result of the methodical procedure, are:\n\nnothing more than those laws and determinations of absolute\nactuality which govern and constitute any simple nature, as heat,\nlight, weight, in every kind of matter and subject that is susceptible\nof them (Bacon IV [1901], 145\u20136);\nThey are not identical with natural law, but with definitions of\nsimple natures (elements) or ultimate ingredients of things from which\nthe basic material structure has been built (Gaukroger 2001,\n140). Forms are the structures constituted by the elements in nature\n(microphysics). This evokes a cross-reference to Bacon's atomism,\nwhich has been called the \u201cconstructivist component\u201d\n(P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988, 116) of his system, including an alchemical\ntheory about basic kinds of matter. He aims at \u201cunderstanding\nthe basic structures of things \u2026 as a means to transforming\nnature for human purposes\u201d (Gaukroger 2001, 140; Clericuzio\n2000, 78ff.); and thus he \u201cends\u201d the unfinished Novum\nOrganum with a list of things which still have to be achieved or\nwith a catalogue of phenomena which are important and indispensable\nfor a future natural history.\n\n\nHistorians of science, with their predilection for mathematical\nphysics, used to criticize Bacon's approach, stating that\n\u201cthe Baconian concept of science, as an inductive science, has\nnothing to do with and even contradicts today's form of\nscience\u201d (Malherbe 1996, 75). In reaching this verdict, however,\nthey overlooked the fact that a natural philosophy based on a theory of\nmatter cannot be assessed on the grounds of a natural philosophy or\nscience based on mechanics as the fundamental discipline. One can\naccount for this chronic mode of misunderstanding as a specimen of the\nparadigmatic fallacy (Gaukroger 2001, 134ff.; see Rees 1986).\n\n\nBacon came to the fundamental insight that facts cannot be\ncollected from nature, but must be constituted by methodical\nprocedures, which have to be put into practice by scientists in order\nto ascertain the empirical basis for inductive generalizations. His\ninduction, founded on collection, comparison, and exclusion of factual\nqualities in things and their interior structure, proved to be a\nrevolutionary achievement within natural philosophy, for which no\nexample in classical antiquity existed. His scala intellectus\nhas two contrary movements \u201cupwards and downwards: from\naxiomata to experimenta and opera and back\nagain\u201d (P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988, 236). Bacon's induction\nwas construed and conceived as an instrument or method of discovery.\nAbove all, his emphasis on negative instances for the procedure of\ninduction itself can claim a high importance with regard to knowledge\nacquisition and has been acclaimed as an innovation by scholars of our\ntime. Some have detected in Bacon a forerunner of Karl Popper in\nrespect of the method of falsification. Finally, it cannot be denied\nthat Bacon's methodological program of induction includes aspects\nof deduction and abstraction on the basis of negation and exclusion.\nContemporary scholars have praised his inauguration of the theory of\ninduction. This theory has been held in higher esteem since the 1970s\nthan it was for a long period before (see the work of Rees, Gaukroger\nand P\u00e9rez-Ramos 1988, 201\u201385). Nevertheless, it is\ndoubtful that Bacon's critics, who were associated with the\ntraditions of positivism and analytical philosophy, acquired sufficient\nknowledge of his writings to produce solid warrants for their\ncriticisms (Cohen 1970, 124\u201334; Cohen 1985, 58ff.; on the\ngeneral problem of induction see, e.g.,  Hempel 1966; Swinburne\n(ed.) 1974; Lambert and Brittan 1979 [1987]).  In comparison to the\nneglect of Bacon in the twentieth century, a more recent and deeper\nassessment of his work has arisen in connection with the \u201cOxford\nFrancis Bacon\u201d project, which was launched in the late 1990s by\nGraham Rees, who directed it until his death in 2009; it is now under\nthe general editorship of Brian Vickers.\n",
