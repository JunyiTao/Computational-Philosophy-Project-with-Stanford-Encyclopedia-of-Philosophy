    "main_text": "\n\nJean-Baptiste Du Bos (b. 1670, d. 1742) was a French antiquarian,\nhistorian, diplomat, polymath, and aesthetician. He participated in\nthe Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns, wrote on numismatics, delved\ninto a variety of historical questions, and had an enduring love of\nthe fine arts. Today he is primarily known as the author of\nCritical Reflections on Poetry and Painting (1719) and as one\nof the founders of modern aesthetics. Deeply influenced by his friend\nJohn Locke, Du Bos made a major contribution to the spread of\nempiricism in France, both in aesthetics and other areas of\nphilosophy. He influenced almost all eighteenth-century contributors\nto aesthetics, including Charles Batteux, Alexander Gottlieb\nBaumgarten, David Hume, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Moses Mendelssohn,\nand Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\n",
