(Geach\n1955: 71)\n\n\n\nThe problem, he says, is that Curry\u2019s paradox \u201ccannot be\nresolved merely by adopting a system that contains a queer sort of\nnegation\u201d. Rather, \u201cif we want to retain the naive view of\ntruth, or the naive view of classes \u2026, then we must modify the\nelementary rules of inference relating to \u2018if\u2019\u201d\n(1955: 72). Geach\u2019s view of the\nsignificance of Curry\u2019s paradox is closely echoed by Meyer,\nRoutley, and Dunn (1979: 127). They\nconclude that Curry\u2019s paradox frustrates those who had\n\u201choped that weakening classical negation principles\u201d would\n resolve Russell\u2019s\n paradox.[20]\n\n\n\nIn short, the point is that there are non-classical logics with weak\nnegation principles that resolve Russell\u2019s paradox and the Liar,\nyet remain vulnerable to Curry\u2019s paradox. These are logics with\nthe following features:\n\n(a)\nThey can serve as\n    the basis for a nontrivial theory according to which some sentence is\n    intersubstitutable with its own negation.\n(b)\nThey can\u2019t\n    serve as the basis for a nontrivial theory that is\n    Curry-complete.\n\n\n\nWhile it is unclear which logics Geach may have had in mind, there are\nindeed non-classical logics that meet these two conditions. Theories\nbased on these logics accordingly remain vulnerable to Curry\u2019s\nparadox.\n5.1.1 Paraconsistent Solutions Frustrated\n\n\nMeyer, Routley, and Dunn (1979) call\nattention to one class of logics that meet conditions (a) and (b).\n They are among the \n paraconsistent logics,\n which are logics\naccording to which a sentence together with its negation will \nnot entail any arbitrary sentence. Paraconsistent logics can be used to obtain\ntheories that resolve Russell\u2019s paradox, and the Liar, by\nembracing negation inconsistency without succumbing to triviality.\n\n\nAccording to such a theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), sentences \\(\\lambda\\) and\n\\(\\lnot\\lambda\\) can be intersubstitutable, as long as both \n\\(\\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} \\lambda\\) and \\(\\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} \\lnot \\lambda\\).\nSuch theories are \u201cglutty\u201d, in the sense that they affirm\n some sentence together with its negation (see entry on\n dialetheism).\n Yet a number of prominent paraconsistent logics can\u2019t serve as\nthe basis for Curry-complete theories on pain of triviality. Such\nlogics are sometimes said to fail to be \u201cCurry\n paraconsistent\u201d (Slaney\n 1989).[21]\n\n5.1.2 Paracomplete Solutions Frustrated\n\n\nMany of the non-classical logics that have been proposed to underwrite\nresponses to Russell\u2019s paradox and the Liar paradox are\nparacomplete logics, logics that reject the law of excluded\nmiddle. These logics make possible \u201cgappy\u201d theories. In\nparticular, where \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\lnot\\lambda\\) are\nintersubstitutable according to such a theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), it will\nfail to be the case that \\(\\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} \\lambda \\lor \\lnot\n\\lambda\\). Some of these paracomplete logics likewise meet conditions\n(a) and (b).\n\n\nOne example is the logic \u0141\\(_{3}\\) based on the three-valued\ntruth-tables of \u0141ukasiewicz (see, e.g.,\nPriest 2008). Since it meets condition (a), \u0141\\(_{3}\\)\noffers a possible response to Russell\u2019s paradox and the\nLiar\u2014in particular, a gappy response. Yet consider the\niterated conditional \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}(\\alpha\n{\\rightarrow}\\beta)\\), which we abbreviate as \\(\\alpha \\Rightarrow\n\\beta\\). Suppose that a Curry sentence for \\(\\pi\\) and an\n\u0141\\(_{3}\\)-based theory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is redefined to be any\nsentence \\(\\kappa\\) intersubstitutable with \\(\\kappa \\Rightarrow\n\\pi\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) will meet all the conditions of the\nCurry-Paradox Lemma, as was first noted by Moh\n(1954). Hence, as long as there is a \\(\\kappa\\) that is\nintersubstitutable with \\(\\kappa \\Rightarrow \\pi\\) according to\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\), then \\(\\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi\\). Consequently\n \u0141\\(_{3}\\) won\u2019t underwrite a response to Curry\u2019s\n paradox.[22]\n\n\n\nTo summarize: Curry\u2019s paradox stands in the way of some\notherwise available avenues for resolving semantic paradoxes by means\nof glutty or gappy theories. As a result, the need to evade\nCurry\u2019s paradox has played a significant role in the development\nof non-classical logics (e.g., Priest 2006;\nField 2008).\n5.2 Pointing to a General Paradox Structure\n\n\nThe negation-free status of Curry\u2019s paradox matters for a second\nreason. Prior makes the following important point:\n\n\n\nWe can \u2026 say not only that Curry\u2019s paradox does not\ninvolve negation but that even Russell\u2019s paradox presupposes\nonly those properties of negation which it shares with implication.\n (Prior 1955:\n 180)[23]\n\n\n\n\nWhat he has in mind is that Russell\u2019s paradox and Curry\u2019s\nparadox can be understood as resulting from the same general\nstructure, which can be instantiated either using negation or\n using a\n conditional.[24]\n\n\n\nThe general structure can be made explicit by defining a type of unary\nconnective that gives rise to Curry\u2019s paradox, and showing how\nthis type is exemplified both by negation and by a unary connective\ndefined in terms of a conditional.\n\n\nDefinition 3 (Curry connective)\n Let \\(\\pi\\) be a sentence in the language of\ntheory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). The unary connective \\(\\odot\\) is a Curry\nconnective for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) provided it satisfies two\nprinciples: \n\n\\[\\tag{P1}\n\\textrm{If} \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha \\textrm{ and } \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\odot\\alpha \\textrm{ then } \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi.\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\\tag{P2}\n\\textrm{If } \\alpha \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\odot\\alpha \\textrm{ then } \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\odot\\alpha.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Curry-Paradox Lemma Suppose that\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is such that Id holds and that for some pair of\nsentences \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mu\\), (i) \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\odot\\mu\\) are\nintersubstitutable according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) and (ii) \\(\\odot\\) is\na Curry connective for \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). In that case\n \\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}}\n \\pi\\).[25]\n\n\nProof:  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rll}\n1  & \\mu \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\mu &\n  \\textrm{Id }\\\\\n2  & \\mu \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\odot\\mu &\n  \\textrm{1 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\\\\n3  & \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\odot\\mu &\n  \\textrm{2 P2 }\\\\\n4  & \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\mu &\n  \\textrm{3 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\\\\n5  & \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\pi &\n  \\textrm{3, 4 P1 }\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nThe Generalized Curry-Paradox Lemma can now be instantiated in two\ndifferent ways, so as to yield either Curry\u2019s paradox or a\nnegation paradox:\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain Curry\u2019s paradox, let the unary connective \\(\\odot\\) be\nsuch that \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\), and let\n\\(\\mu\\) be a sentence intersubstitutable with \\(\\mu\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). Then P1 amounts to\nthe instance of MP used in our derivation of the Curry-Paradox Lemma,\nwhile P2 is nothing other than our rule Cont. \n\n\\[\\tag{MP}\n\\textrm{If }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\beta\\textrm{ and }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\textrm{ then }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\beta\n\\]\n\n\\[\\tag{Cont}\n\\textrm{If }\\alpha \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\beta\\textrm{ then }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\beta\n\\]\n\n \n\n\nTo obtain a negation paradox, let \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) be \\(\\lnot\\alpha\\),\nand let \\(\\mu\\) be a sentence intersubstitutable with \\(\\lnot\\mu\\)\naccording to\n \\(\\mathcal{T}\\).[26]\n Then P1 amounts to an instance of ex contradictione\nquodlibet (or \u201cexplosion\u201d), while P2 is a\nreductio principle. \n\n\\[\\tag{ECQ}\n\\textrm{If }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\alpha\\textrm{ and }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\lnot\\alpha\\textrm{ then }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\beta\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\\tag{Red}\n\\textrm{If }\\alpha \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\lnot\\alpha\\textrm{ then }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}} \\lnot\\alpha\n\\]\n\n \n\n\n\nPrior\u2019s point is that the features of negation that are relevant\nto Russell\u2019s paradox or the Liar paradox are exhausted by\nits status as a Curry connective. This makes clear why these\nparadoxes do not depend on features of negation, such as excluded\nmiddle or double negation elimination, that fail to hold in\nnonclassical theories where negation remains a Curry connective (e.g.,\n in intuitionistic theories, where ECQ and Red both\n hold).[27]\n\n\n\nMoreover, a Curry connective need not be very negation-like at all. It\n may fail to be even a minimal negation (see entry on\n negation),\n since it need not obey the law of double introduction:\n\n\\[\\tag{DI}\n\\alpha \\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} \\odot\\odot\\alpha.\n\\]\n\n\n\nFor example, suppose that \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is \\(\\alpha\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi\\). Then in order for \\(\\odot\\) to obey DI, it would\nhave to be the case that \\(\\alpha \\vdash _{\\mathcal{T}} (\\alpha\n{\\rightarrow}\\pi) {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\). That principle is violated by a\nnumber of non-classical theories for which \\(\\odot\\), when defined\n this way, does qualify as a Curry\n connective.[28]\n\n\n\nTo summarize: Curry\u2019s paradox points to a general structure\ninstantiated by a wide range of paradoxes. This structure\ndoesn\u2019t itself involve negation, but it is also displayed by\nparadoxes that (unlike Curry\u2019s paradox) do essentially involve\nnegation, such as Russell\u2019s paradox and the Liar paradox.\n\n\nThe issue of which paradoxes display a common structure becomes\nimportant in light of the \u201cprinciple of uniform solution\u201d\ninfluentially advocated by Priest (1994). According to this principle,\nparadoxes that belong to the \u201csame kind\u201d should receive\nthe \u201csame kind of solution\u201d. Suppose that we delimit one\nkind of paradox as follows:\n\n\nDefinition 4 (Generalized Curry paradox) We have a\ngeneralized Curry paradox in any case where the assumptions stated in\nthe Generalized Curry-Paradox Lemma appear to hold.\n\n\nAssuming one accepts the principle of uniform solution, the question\nbecomes what counts as proposing a uniform solution to all generalized\nCurry paradoxes. In particular, does it suffice to show, for every\ninstance of the kind thus delimited, that what appears to be a Curry\nconnective in fact fails to be one? It would seem that this should\nindeed be enough. It\u2019s unclear why uniformity should\nadditionally require that all seeming Curry connectives fail to\nqualify as such in virtue of violating the same\ncondition. For instance, suppose that negation and our unary\nconnective defined using \\({\\rightarrow}\\) both appear to satisfy the\ngeneralized principle P2, in the former case because \\({\\lnot}\\)\nappears to obey Red and in the latter case because \\({\\rightarrow}\\)\nappears to obey Cont. Unless these two appearances share a common\nsource (e.g., an implicit reliance on structural contraction, as\nclaimed by Zardini 2011), there need be nothing objectionably\nnon-uniform about taking one appearance at face value while dismissing\nthe other as deceptive. (For discussion of the philosophical issue\nhere, applied to a different class of paradoxes, see the exchange in\nSmith 2000 and Priest 2000.)\n\nIf that is right, the desideratum that generalized Curry paradoxes be\nresolved uniformly needn\u2019t discriminate between the various\nlogically revisionary solutions that have been pursued. These include\nthe following three options:\n\nOne might hold that it is principle P1 alone that fails when\n\\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is instantiated as \\(\\lnot\\alpha\\) (to get a negation\nparadox), whereas it is P2 alone that fails when \\(\\odot\\alpha\\) is\ninstantiated as \\(\\alpha {\\rightarrow}\\pi\\) (to get a Curry paradox).\nOn this approach, ECQ and Cont fail, while Red and MP hold (Priest\n1994, 2006).\nOne might hold that P2 alone fails for both instantiations of\n\\(\\odot\\). On this approach, Red and Cont fail, while ECQ and MP hold\n(Field 2008; Zardini 2011).\n\n\nOne might hold that P1 alone fails for both instantiations of\n\\(\\odot\\). On this approach, ECQ and MP fail, while Red and Cont hold\n(Beall 2015; Ripley 2013).\n\n\nThus, for example, Priest\u2019s own approach would count as\nresolving Curry\u2019s paradox and the Liar paradox uniformly qua\nexamples of generalized Curry paradox. This would be the case\ndespite the fact that Priest evaluates Liar sentences as both true and\nfalse, whereas he rejects the claim that Curry sentences are true.\n\nIn any event, Curry\u2019s paradox raises challenges in connection\nwith the issue of what type of uniformity should be required of\nsolutions to various paradoxes (see also Zardini 2015). Priest himself calls attention to a\nkind of paradox narrower than the generalized Curry paradoxes, a kind\nwhose instances include the negation paradoxes but exclude\nCurry\u2019s paradox. This kind is picked out by Priest\u2019s\n\u201cInclosure Schema\u201d (2002);\n see the entry on\n self-reference.\n One ongoing dispute is about whether there might be a version of\nCurry\u2019s paradox that counts as an \u201cinclosure\nparadox\u201d, though it resists Priest\u2019s uniform dialetheic\nsolution to such paradoxes (see the exchange in Beall\n2014b, Weber et\nal. 2014, and Beall 2014a, as\nwell as Pleitz 2015).\n6. Validity Curry\n\n\nThe last decade (as of the date of this version of this entry) has\nwitnessed a boom in attention to Curry paradoxes, and perhaps\nespecially to what have been called validity Curry or\nv-Curry paradoxes (Whittle 2004;\n Shapiro 2011; Beall & Murzi\n 2013).[29]\n V-Curry involves Curry sentences that specifically invoke a\ntheory\u2019s consequence or \u201cvalidity\u201d relation, by\nusing either a conditional or a predicate that purports to express\ntheory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)\u2019s relation \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\\) in the\nlanguage of \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) itself.\n6.1 Connective Form\n\n\nFor one form of v-Curry paradox, let the conditional mentioned in the\n definition of a Curry sentence\n (Definition 1)\n be a consequence connective \\({\\Rightarrow}\\). A sentence\nwith \\({\\Rightarrow}\\) as its major operator is to be interpreted\nthus: \u201cThat \\(p\\) entails (according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)) that\n\\(q\\)\u201d. \nWe now immediately obtain property-theoretic, set-theoretic or\ntruth-theoretic versions of Curry\u2019s paradox, provided only that\n\\({\\Rightarrow}\\) meets the conditions MP and Cont of the\nCurry-Paradox Lemma. \n\n\nWhat makes this instance of the Curry-Paradox\nLemma particularly troublesome is that it poses an obstacle to one\ncommon response to Curry\u2019s paradox, namely the weakly\n contraction-free response discussed in\n section 4.2.1.  That response depended on\n rejecting the rule CP of single-premise conditional proof, one\ndirection of the single-premise \u201cdeduction theorem\u201d. But\nthis is a rule that has seemed difficult to resist for a consequence\nconnective (Shapiro 2011; Weber 2014; Zardini 2013). If \\(\\beta\\) is\na consequence of \\(\\alpha\\) according to the consequence relation of\ntheory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), where this theory has \\({\\Rightarrow}\\) as\nits own consequence connective, then \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) must surely\ncontain the consequence claim \\(\\alpha\n{\\Rightarrow}\\beta\\). Likewise, this variety of Curry paradox poses\nan obstacle for detachment-free responses, which require\nrejecting the rule MP. If a theory with its own consequence\nconnective contains both \\(\\alpha\\) and the consequence conditional\n\\(\\alpha {\\Rightarrow}\\beta\\), then it must surely contain \\(\\beta\\)\nas well. Or so, at least, it has seemed. Admittedly, the proponent of\na weakly detachment-free response will argue that MP for\n \\({\\Rightarrow}\\) illicitly builds in transitivity\n (see section 4.2.2).  Still, what seems\n inescapable is the converse of CP, the rule CCP that is the other\ndirection of the single-premise deduction theorem. If a theory\ncontains the consequence conditional \\(\\alpha {\\Rightarrow}\\beta\\),\nthen surely \\(\\beta\\) follows from \\(\\alpha\\) according to the\ntheory. That would still rule out a strongly detachment-free\nresponse.\n6.2 Predicate Form\n\n\nA second form of v-Curry paradox arises for a theory \\(\\mathcal{T}_V\\)\nwhose subject-matter includes the single-premise consequence relation\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}}\\) that obtains, according to that very\ntheory, between sentences in its\n language.[30]\n Let this relation be expressed by the predicate \\(Val(x,y)\\), and\nassume further that there is a sentence \\(\\chi\\) that is either\n\\(Val(\\langle\\chi\\rangle, \\langle\\pi\\rangle)\\), or is at least intersubstitutable with the latter according to \\(\\mathcal{T}_V\\). One form of v-Curry\nparadox employs two principles governing \\(Val\\), which we call\n\u201cvalidity detachment\u201d and \u201cvalidity proof\u201d\nfollowing Beall & Murzi (2013).\n\n\\[\\tag{VD}\n\\textrm{If }\\gamma \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} Val(\\langle\\alpha\\rangle, \\langle\\beta\\rangle)\\textrm{ and }\\gamma \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\alpha\\textrm{ then }\\gamma \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\beta\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\\tag{VP}\n\\textrm{If }\\alpha \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\beta\\textrm{ then }\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} Val(\\langle\\alpha\\rangle, \\langle\\beta\\rangle)\n\\]\n\n\nUsing these principles, we get the following quick argument for\n\\(\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\pi\\). \n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rll}\n1  & \\chi \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\chi &\n  \\textrm{Id }\\\\\n2  & \\chi \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} Val(\\langle\\chi\\rangle, \\langle\\pi\\rangle) &\n  \\textrm{2 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\\\\n3  & \\chi \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\pi &\n  \\textrm{1, 2 VD }\\\\\n4  & \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} Val(\\langle\\chi\\rangle, \\langle\\pi\\rangle) &\n  \\textrm{3 VP }\\\\\n5  & \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\chi &\n  \\textrm{4 Curry-intersubstitutivity }\\\\\n6  & \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\pi &\n  \\textrm{4, 5 VD }\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nAs applied to this predicate form of v-Curry, a weakly\ncontraction-free response would resist the \u201ccontraction\u201d\nfrom step 2 to step 4 by rejecting the rule VP, and a\ndetachment-free response would reject VD, even in the zero-premise form used at step 6. Again, though, both\nVP and zero-premise VD have seemed inescapable in view of the intended\ninterpretation of the predicate \\(Val\\) (Beall\n& Murzi 2013; Murzi 2014; Murzi & Shapiro 2015; Priest 2015;\nZardini 2014).[31] \n Finally, even if VD is rejected as illicitly involving transitivity, what seems inescapable is the converse of VP. If so, that would at least rule out a strongly detachment-free response.\n\nAn arguably more powerful version of v-Curry reasoning is presented by\nShapiro (2013) and Field\n(2017: 7). This reasoning can take either\nconnective or predicate form, but it doesn\u2019t depend on CP or VP.\nHere we give the predicate form using \\(Val\\). As above, we first\nderive that \\(\\chi \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\pi\\) using VD. In view of the\nmeaning of \\(Val\\), the conclusion that \\(\\chi \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}}\n\\pi\\) shows that \\(Val(\\langle\\chi\\rangle, \\langle\\pi\\rangle)\\) is\ntrue, i.e., that \\(\\chi\\) is true. But if \\(\\chi\\) is true and \\(\\chi \\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}}\n\\pi\\), then it would seem\n\\(\\pi\\) must also be true. Since weakly detachment-free\n(nontransitive) responses to v-Curry do allow the derivation of \\(\\chi\n\\vdash_{\\mathcal{T}_{V}} \\pi\\), this reasoning poses an objection to\nsuch responses as well.\n6.3 Significance\n\nIf, in fact, v-Curry paradoxes aren\u2019t amenable to weakly\ncontraction-free or strongly detachment-free responses, then (assuming the rule Id is retained) the\nspace of Curry-complete responses is restricted to strongly\ncontraction-free and weakly detachment-free responses.\nThe former responses, as explained in\n section 4.2.1,\n are typically presented by reformulating modus ponens (or detachment for the validity predicate) in a substructural deduction system and rejecting the structural contraction rule sCont. The\nlatter responses, as explained in\n section 4.2.2,\n reject the structural principle of transitivity. For this reason,\nv-Curry paradoxes have sometimes been taken to motivate\nsubstructural consequence relations (e.g.,\nBarrio et al. forthcoming; Beall & Murzi\n2013; Ripley 2015a; Shapiro 2011, 2015).[32]\n\nThe lively and wide-ranging debate on v-Curry paradoxes has resulted\nin genuine progress in our understanding of Curry paradoxes. In the\nend, what has become clear is that while v-Curry paradoxes may invite\ndifferent resolutions from non-v-Curry paradoxes, they remain within\nthe same mold as generalized Curry paradoxes. In particular, in the\ngeneral template of\n section 5.2\n one may take \\(\\odot\\) to express (either as a predicate or as a\nconnective) consequence in light of \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\\) itself.\nThis is the heart of v-Curry. Inasmuch as there are (many) different\n(formal) consequence relations definable over our language (e.g.,\nlogical consequence in virtue of logical vocabulary, epistemic\nconsequence in virtue of logical-plus-epistemic vocabulary, and so on)\nthere are thereby many different v-Curry paradoxes that may arise.\nStill, the space of solutions to these paradoxes is the space of\nsolutions to the generalized Curry paradoxes canvassed in this\nentry.\n\nThere remain, however, at least two reasons v-Curry paradoxes merit\nseparate attention.  First, as noted above, two categories of\nCurry-complete solutions \u2014 the weakly contraction-free and\nstrongly detachment-free options \u2014 have appeared especially\nproblematic in the case of v-Curry paradoxes. Second, suppose that one\ntreats an ordinary Curry paradox (property-theoretic, set-theoretic or\nsemantic) in a Curry-complete fashion. There may still be reason to\ntreat the corresponding (connective or predicate) v-Curry paradox in a\nCurry-incomplete fashion, perhaps in virtue of seeing a theory\u2019s\nconsequence relation as essentially beyond capture by any connective\nor predicate in the language of the theory (see, e.g., Myhill 1975;\nWhittle 2004). Thus, a \u201cnon-uniform\u201d solution to ordinary\nCurry paradoxes and their v-Curry counterparts may \u2014 once\nagain \u2014 be a motivated\nnon-uniformity.[33]",
