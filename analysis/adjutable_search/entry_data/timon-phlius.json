    "preamble": "\n\nTimon (c. 320\u2013230 BCE) was the younger contemporary and leading\ndisciple of\n Pyrrho\n of Elis. Unlike Pyrrho, he wrote numerous poems and prose works;\nfragments of and reports on some of these have survived, by far the\nlargest number (more than sixty) being from the Silloi\n(Lampoons). Several of these works were devoted to, or at\nleast included, laudatory descriptions of Pyrrho and his philosophy;\nthe Silloi appears to have contained some passages in this\nvein, but consisted largely of satirical thumbnail sketches of a wide\nrange of other philosophers, all of whom, in Timon\u2019s estimation,\nfailed wholly or partly to achieve the ideal outlook exemplified by\nPyrrho. Despite the hazards of attempting to extrapolate from this\nmeager and highly colored material, it constitutes much the best\nevidence we have for the character of Pyrrho\u2019s thought. There\nis, however, some indication that Timon also took stands on\nphilosophical matters about which Pyrrho is unlikely to have had\nanything to say. And even when he can be assumed to be emulating\nPyrrho\u2019s frame of mind, he may sometimes be expanding on or\nadapting Pyrrho\u2019s original position rather than simply reporting\nit. He should not, then, be regarded as a mere carbon copy of his\nteacher.\n\nThe present article concentrates on the nature of Timon\u2019s\nwritings, and on contributions to philosophy that may be thought to be\noriginal with him.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nOn the basis of a number of slender indications, Timon\u2019s date of\nbirth is generally set at around 325\u2013320 BCE and his date of\ndeath at around 235\u2013230 BCE. For the details of his life we are\nwholly dependent on the brief account in Diogenes Laertius\n(9.109\u2013115) (see the entry on\n doxography of ancient philosophy);\n Diogenes wrote perhaps in the early to mid-third century CE, but his\naccount claims to be drawn from several earlier sources. According to\nDiogenes, Timon initially studied (after an early career as a dancer\nin his home town of Phlius, an inland city of the Peloponnese not far\nfrom the gulf of Corinth) with Stilpo of Megara. After an interval in\nwhich he returned home and married, he then went to Elis, in the\nnorthwest corner of the Peloponnese, to study with Pyrrho. Diogenes\nmakes it sound as if his stay at Elis was relatively brief; he says\nthat it lasted until Timon had children (9.109), and that at that\npoint he was compelled to go elsewhere to make money as a sophist, or\npaid teacher of philosophical and other theory to late adolescent\nyoung men. But whatever the length of his association with Pyrrho,\nTimon became an adherent of Pyrrho\u2019s philosophy from then on.\nHis activities as a sophist (whatever exactly these involved) appear\nto have left him financially secure; we are told that he then went to\nAthens and lived there (except for a short stay at Thebes) until his\ndeath. Diogenes names two kings with whom he was acquainted, and\nseveral poets with whom he collaborated; it is difficult to know what\nto make of this information, although the work of Clayman (2009) has\nshown, by means of detailed parallels with contemporary poetry, that\nhe was deeply immersed in the poetic world of his time. During his\ntime at Athens\u2014probably several decades\u2014he is likely also\nto have made the acquaintance of the leading philosophers of the time;\nDiogenes includes anecdotes featuring him making fun of\n Arcesilaus,\n who was head of the Academy during most or all of this time, but he\nno doubt encountered Stoics and Epicureans as well. That no\nrepresentatives of any of these schools refer to him in any surviving\nrecords is perhaps not surprising, given the scathing critiques that\nare implicit in his portraits of them in the Silloi.\n2. Works\n\nThe Silloi, in hexameter verse, has already been mentioned.\nThe other poem from which a few fragments survive was called\nIndalmoi (Images or Appearances), which was\nin elegiac couplets (alternating hexameters and pentameters). The\nsignificance of this title is by no means clear. It might refer to the\n\u201cappearances\u201d on the basis of which Pyrrhonists are\ncompelled to make their decisions; one of the surviving lines from the\npoem reads \u201cBut the appearance [to phainomenon] is\npowerful everywhere, wherever it comes\u201d (quoted in Diogenes\nLaertius 9.105), and most scholars have taken this to point to the\nimportance of appearances in shaping our actions. Another possibility\nis that the \u2018images\u2019 referred to in the title are images\nof Pyrrho himself, and that the poem was a depiction of Pyrrho and his\nblissful tranquility; the longest surviving fragment from the\npoem\u2014a sequence of seven lines pieced together from three\npassages in Diogenes Laertius and Sextus Empiricus\u2014certainly\nfits this description. A third suggestion is that \u2018images\u2019\nor \u2018appearances\u2019 is to be taken in a negative sense,\nreferring to the fictions or illusions by which naive non-Pyrrhonists\nare taken in. Possible support for this comes from a single pentameter\nline, which is regularly assigned to the Indalmoi because of\nthe meter. This reads \u201cbut these things are judged by mind [or:\nby convention] on the part of humans\u201d (Sextus Empiricus\nM 11.140); the context suggests that the \u2018things\u2019\nin question are things (wrongly) taken to be by nature good or bad.\nNone of these proposals as to the character of the work can be ruled\nout, but none can be regarded as more than conjecture. With the\nexception of a four-line fragment about \u201cthe nature of the\ndivine and the good\u201d, which is probably the most contentious of\nall the fragments of Timon, no other lines survive beyond the three\npassages just referred to. (See the discussion of \u201cThe Nature of\nthe Divine and the Good\u201d in Section 6 of the entry on\n Pyrrho,\n for a brief account of the difficulties surrounding this fragment.)\nNor do we have any general description of the work (unlike in the case\nof the Silloi\u2014see the next section); Diogenes Laertius\ndoes not even include it in his list of Timon\u2019s works, although\nhe does elsewhere cite it. Thus despite the importance of the few\nsurviving pieces of the Indalmoi, the poem as a whole is\nalmost entirely opaque to us.\n\nDiogenes (9.110) claims that, in addition to the poems already\nmentioned, Timon wrote sixty tragedies and thirty comedies, as well as\nepics, satyr plays and kinaidoi (usually translated\n\u2018obscene poems\u2019\u2014kinaidos normally means\n\u2018catamite\u2019; see Strabo 14.1.41, Athenaeus XIV.620e\u2013f\nfor what appear to be other references to the same verse form). He\nsays that Timon indulged in poetry while taking time off from\nphilosophy; but the poems he lists in this context include the\nSilloi, which certainly qualifies as part of Timon\u2019s\nphilosophical activity. The report is confused in other ways as well;\nin any case, no trace of this voluminous non-philosophical corpus, if\nit ever existed, seems to have survived. (There are a few lines of\nTimon\u2019s verse that cannot be definitely attributed to either the\nSilloi or the Indalmoi; but there is no particular\nreason to believe that they derive from any of these other works.)\n\nThe remaining works attributed to Timon are prose works. Of these the\nmost important is the Pytho. We are told (by Aristocles in\nEusebius, Praeparatio evangelica 14.18.14) that this\ndescribed a meeting and a dialogue between Timon and Pyrrho; Timon\nportrayed himself as encountering Pyrrho by a temple, as he was\nwalking towards Pytho (the region that included Delphi). Whether the\nwork itself was in dialogue form, or merely recounted a dialogue in\nthe third person, is not clear. But it appears that this dialogue\nconsisted of a thorough presentation of Pyrrho\u2019s outlook and\ndemeanor; Diogenes Laertius, in what seems to be a reference to the\nsame work (9.67), says that Timon \u2018clarifies\u2019\n(diasaphei) Pyrrho\u2019s disposition (diathesin)\nin the account that he \u2018goes through\u2019 (diexeisin,\na word often used of detailed exposition). This account will\npresumably have been placed in Pyrrho\u2019s mouth, with Timon\nhimself depicted as an eager pupil. (This motif seems to have been a\nrecurring one in Timon\u2019s writings; fragments from both the\nSilloi and the Indalmoi consist of questions put to\nPyrrho\u2014most probably by Timon himself as speaker\u2014about how\nhe manages to sustain his tranquility.) There is one quotation from\nthe Pytho and one further report about a statement that it\nincluded; both are of some philosophical significance, and will be\ntouched on below, but neither furnishes any additional clues\nconcerning the general character of the Pytho itself. It has\nusually been thought that the setting of the dialogue has symbolic\nsignificance (Delphi being the seat of the important oracle of\nApollo), but the interpretations that have been offered of this are\nvarious. Aristocles offers a summary of an exposition by\u00a0Timon of\nwhat have generally been regarded as\u00a0the central points of\nPyrrho\u2019s philosophy. This is often thought to have occurred in\nthe Pytho,\u00a0but this is no more than plausible\nspeculation. Moreover, though this\u00a0passage certainly alludes to\nsomething that Pyrrho said, it is by no means obvious how much of\nit\u00a0actually reproduces Pyrrho\u2019s ideas and how much is Timon\u2019s own\ndevelopment of these ideas;\u00a0for discussion of this see the entry\non\n Pyrrho.\n\nDiogenes (9.105) mentions a work called On the Senses and\nSextus (M 3.2) mentions a work called Against the\nPhysicists. Again, the specific words or ideas that are\nattributed to Timon in these contexts deserve some discussion, but\nthey tell us little or nothing about the works themselves, beyond what\nthe titles would anyway suggest. It is worth noting, however, that\nthere is no indication that these works consisted of or included\nexposition of Pyrrho\u2019s philosophy. Finally, Diogenes tells us\n(9.115) that Timon praised Arcesilaus (who, during Timon\u2019s\nlifetime, took the Academy in a skeptical direction) in a work called\nArcesilaus\u2019 Funeral Banquet\u2014this by contrast with\nhis attacks on him in the Silloi, as Diogenes mentions and as\nwe can confirm from the surviving fragments. This work is generally\ntaken as evidence that Timon outlived Arcesilaus. But given\nTimon\u2019s penchant for elaborate narrative conceits, the inference\nis hazardous. As Clayman (2009), 13\u201315 has made clear, the\nfuneral banquet was a recognized parodic verse form dating back to\nbefore Timon\u2019s day, and by no means requires that its subjects\nbe actually deceased; the genre also gives us grounds for wondering\nwhether the praise of Arcesilaus was partly or even wholly\nmock-praise.\n2.1 The Shape and Character of the Silloi\n\nLiterary devices appear to have been extensively employed in the\nSilloi. Diogenes Laertius tells us (9.111) that the\nSilloi was divided into three books. In the first book Timon\nspoke solely in the first person, whereas the second and third took\nthe form of dialogues between Timon himself and the early (late 6th c.\nBCE) philosopher\n Xenophanes.\n Timon is said to have questioned Xenophanes about every\nphilosopher\u2014the older ones in the second book and the more\nrecent in the third book\u2014and Xenophanes answered him. The work\nas a whole, however, was devoted to abuse and ridicule of\nnon-Pyrrhonist philosophers. It looks as if part of the work was\nmodeled after the famous scene in Odyssey Book XI where\nOdysseus visits the underworld; several fragments include the words\n\u2018I saw\u2019 or \u2018I recognized\u2019 (where the person\nseen or recognized is a dead philosopher), and this formula is highly\nreminiscent of Odysseus\u2019 language in describing his encounters\nwith his dead comrades. There are other echoes of Homer as well, most\nnotably from the early books of the Iliad, the effect being\nto represent philosophical disputants as literal combatants. Clayman\n(2009), chapter 3 identifies two other likely scenes:\n\u201cMarketplace of Ideas\u201d in which philosophers are shown\nselling their ideas, and \u201cHyde Park Corner\u201d, in which\nphilosophers address crowds. Clayman, however, convincingly argues\nagainst the hypothesis of a fishing scene, accepted by several earlier\nscholars; the fragments that have been taken to depict philosophers as\nfishers or as fish frequently do not need to be, or even lend\nthemselves especially to being, interpreted in this way.\n\nTimon is indebted for his style and tone in the Silloi to a\ntradition of moralizing diatribe prevalent among the Cynics. The word\ntuphos, \u2018vanity,\u2019 was a favorite Cynic term of\ninvective, and it occurs in several fragments from the\nSilloi, as do a number of related terms. The Cynic Crates\nalso wrote satirical verses; one of the few surviving fragments of\nCrates begins \u201cAnd I saw Stilpo enduring severe pains in\nMegara,\u201d which is a parody of a line from Odyssey XI\nand again seems to assimilate a philosophical encounter to\nOdysseus\u2019 underworld encounters. Crates\u2019 writings may\nwell, then, have been an important influence on the Silloi\n(on this see Long 1978). A more distant inspiration was Xenophanes,\nwho can plausibly be seen as the originator of the genre of\nphilosophical satire in which Timon was writing. (Later sources even\ngive Silloi as the title of a poem by Xenophanes; but it is\nnot clear whether this title was attached to the poem before or only\nafter Timon\u2019s day.) This is surely part of the reason for\nTimon\u2019s choice of Xenophanes as the main character in the second\nand third books.\n\nBut there were philosophical as well as literary reasons for this\nchoice, and this takes us into the question of the outlook projected\nby the poem. In one of the two surviving fragments concerned with\nXenophanes, he is referred to as hupatuphos, \u2018partly\nfree from tuphos.\u2019 Pyrrho is the only one who managed\nto be entirely \u2018free from tuphos\u2019\n(atuphos); but in the highly critical context of the\nSilloi, the epithet hupatuphos already raises\nXenophanes above almost all the other philosophers who appear in the\npoem. The specific point for which Timon singles him out for this\nqualified praise is that he was a \u201cmocker of Homeric\ndeception.\u201d This clearly refers to Xenophanes\u2019 criticism\nof Homer\u2019s (and Hesiod\u2019s) anthropomorphic depiction of the\ngods (in which, among other typically human faults, they engage in\ndeception\u2014Timon\u2019s coinage \u2018of Homeric\ndeception\u2019 (Hom\u00earapat\u00eas) may very well be a\nreflection of this point). This is not to say, however, that Timon\nwholly approves of Xenophanes\u2019 theological stance. For\nXenophanes\u2019 positive view, according to which there is one\nunchanging god, appears to be a target for criticism in the same\nfragment (which is why he qualifies only as partly free from\ntuphos). In fact, it looks as if Timon is suspicious of\ntheological pronouncements of any kind. For in another fragment Timon\n(very unusually among ancient commentators) praises Protagoras for his\nagnostic attitude towards the gods. This is understandable given the\ngeneral framework supplied by Pyrrho; however precisely Pyrrho\u2019s\nthought is interpreted, he clearly rejected physical\nspeculation\u2014and it was under that heading that speculation about\nthe gods was taken, in the Hellenistic period, to belong.\n\nIn another fragment Xenophanes is represented as regretting his\nfailure to \u2018look both ways\u2019 (to be\namphoterobleptos), and so embracing an ill-considered monism.\n(This interpretation of Xenophanes, which assimilates him to the\nEleatics, is highly disputable given the surviving fragments, but was\ncommon in the ancient world.) The ability to \u2018look both\nways\u2019 is therefore presented as a positive characteristic, and\nthis is echoed in two other fragments.\n Zeno of Elea\n is described as \u2018double-tongued\u2019\n(amphoterogl\u00f4ssos)\u2014presumably on the basis of his\nparadoxes arguing for two opposite conclusions\u2014and Democritus is\ndescribed as \u2018two-minded\u2019 (amphinoon); the\ncontexts make clear that these, too, are intended as positive\nappellations. Timon is eager, then, to reject any fixed or one-sided\nview of reality. Again, the precise interpretation of this attitude\nwill depend in part on one\u2019s conception of\nPyrrho\u2019s\u00a0philosophy, as Timon saw it; but the link with a\nPyrrhonist outlook is, at a general level, not hard to see. In the\nsame fragment Xenophanes is also pictured as regretting his failure to\nengage in skeptosun\u00ea. It is tempting to read this as an\nearly occurrence of the notion of skepticism familiar to us from the\nlater Pyrrhonist (or Neo-Pyrrhonist) Sextus Empiricus. But there is no\nclear reason for doing so; the term may just mean\n\u2018inquiry\u2019 in the usual sense, and Xenophanes may simply be\nbemoaning his inadequate investigation of things.\n\nZeno is not the only Eleatic thinker to receive favorable treatment in\nthe Silloi. Timon calls Parmenides \u2018high-minded\u2019\nand \u2018not full of opinions,\u2019 and says that he\n\u201celevated our thought-processes from the deception of\nappearance.\u201d This clearly refers to Parmenides\u2019 rejection\nof ordinary common-sense views of reality, and of the senses as an\nadequate guide to the nature of reality; and it is no doubt on the\nsame grounds that Parmenides\u2019 follower Melissus is described as\n\u201cabove many illusions and yielding to few.\u201d This, of\ncourse, indicates that Melissus did go wrong in certain respects, but\nthat is not surprising. As was suggested in the previous paragraph,\nTimon would have had little sympathy for the Eleatics\u2019 positive\ndoctrines; he regards them as valuable because they refuse to accept\nany simple-minded conception according to which things are as they\nseem.\n\nAs was mentioned in the previous section, Timon\u2019s picture of\nArcesilaus, in three surviving fragments of the Silloi,\nappears wholly uncomplimentary; although the imagery in these\nfragments (shorn of their surrounding context) is not entirely\nperspicuous, the general impression seems to be of an unoriginal and\nself-important fool. This may seem surprising given the points just\nmentioned; one might have expected that Arcesilaus\u2019 skepticism\nwould have struck Timon as highly congenial. However, there do clearly\nseem to have been some differences in temperament and approach between\nArcesilaus and Pyrrho; and this may be a case (of a kind common in\nintellectual history) where broad common ground led to especially\nintense rivalry over differences that, from an outsider\u2019s\nperspective, might have seemed insignificant.\n\nWe only have one fragment specifically cited from the Silloi\nin which Pyrrho himself is the subject; one other about Pyrrho is\nregularly and probably correctly assigned to the Silloi, and\nthe same is true of a third fragment about Pyrrho\u2019s follower\nPhilo. In all three fragments (as in the fragment on Pyrrho from the\nIndalmoi) the emphasis is on the attainment of a supremely\ntranquil disposition. This tranquility is associated with a refusal to\nbe involved in detailed speculations about the universe, and also with\nnot engaging in contentious disputes with philosophical opponents. (By\ncontrast, several other fragments about non-Pyrrhonists berate them\nfor their contentiousness.) But these fragments give few if any clues\nabout the specifics of Pyrrho\u2019s (or Timon\u2019s) thought. The\naim in the Silloi is clearly to evoke a certain kind of ideal\nattitude rather than to detail the means of attaining that\nattitude.\n\nThis is not to say, however, that the Silloi has no concern\nfor philosophical detail. We have seen that Timon\u2019s remarks\nabout those philosophers of whom he partially approves often point to\nspecific views of theirs as worthy of praise or criticism. Similarly,\nmany of the fragments on philosophers with whom he has no sympathy\npick on some central point in their philosophies as material for\ncaricature\u2014Mind in the case of\n Anaxagoras,\n for example, or the four basic elements in the case of\n Empedocles.\n The surviving fragments include portraits of most of the major Greek\nphilosophers up to and including Timon\u2019s time; like good\npolitical cartoons, they are sharply drawn and often savagely witty.\nIndeed, it is arguable that the intensity of the implied criticism in\nthese fragments is at odds with the calm demeanor, and the lack of\nconcern with competitive philosophical debate, that Timon elsewhere\ncelebrates in Pyrrho. Timon may have been an effective spokesman for\nPyrrho\u2019s outlook, but it is not clear that he entirely succeeds\nin exemplifying it himself.\n3. Evidence of Other Philosophical Activity\n\nAs was noted earlier, the surviving fragments of the Indalmoi\ninclude a line that is plausibly taken to point to the importance, for\nthe Pyrrhonist, of the appearances of things as a basis for decision\nand action. Whether or not it is this theme that is alluded to in the\ntitle Indalmoi itself (see above, in Section 2, Works), it\nlooks as if this is a topic to which Timon returned in several works.\nThe sole reference to Timon\u2019s On the Senses is a\nquotation that reads \u201cthat honey is sweet I do not posit, but\nthat it appears so I agree\u201d (Diogenes Laertius 9.105). Both the\ncontext in Diogenes, and the obvious implication of the words\nthemselves, suggest that here too Timon is making the same point: for\npractical purposes it is both possible and legitimate for Pyrrhonists\nto let themselves be guided by appearances of things, even while they\nrigorously refrain from attributing definite characteristics to those\nthings in their real nature. On this matter Timon\u2019s influence on\nthe Pyrrhonist tradition seems to have been far-reaching; the same\npoint and the same example (and even the notion of\n\u201cagreeing\u201d that things appear a certain way, although the\nGreek words are not identical) reappear in the opening pages of Sextus\nEmpiricus\u2019 Outlines of Pyrrhonism (1.20).\n\nThe same passage of Diogenes Laertius includes a reference to another\nremark of Timon, this time from the Pytho; according to\nDiogenes, Timon said in this work that he had not \u201cgone outside\nsun\u00eatheia.\u201d Sun\u00eatheia can mean\nseveral things. But the meaning that best fits the context, and the\none that tends to occur in epistemological contexts in general, is\n\u2018ordinary experience.\u2019 Diogenes is commenting on the\nPyrrhonists\u2019 response to the common objection that their\nphilosophy amounts to a rejection of life itself. The Pyrrhonists, he\nsays, reply that this is not so, since they readily accept that things\nappear in their many familiar ways; it is only at the level of the\nunderlying nature of things that they avoid definite pronouncements.\nThe comment from the Pytho is then cited as an instance of\nthis kind of reply. Timon, then, is apparently saying that, in\nallowing the appearances to guide his behavior, he is not doing away\nwith our everyday experience of things.\n\nThe fact that Timon needs to make this statement suggests that the\naccusation regularly leveled against the Pyrrhonists (as well as the\nskeptical Academy), that it would be impossible to live in accordance\nwith their philosophy, goes back to the earliest phase of the\ntradition. It was perhaps in response to this objection that Timon\ndeveloped this position on the practical value of the appearances.\nWhile we cannot exclude the possibility that it was already an element\nin Pyrrho\u2019s thinking, there is no evidence linking Pyrrho with\nany remarks about appearances; this may, then, be Timon\u2019s own\ncontribution, prompted by hostile criticism.\n\nThere are other instances where it is not clear whether Timon is\nsimply reproducing Pyrrho\u2019s outlook or adding creatively to it.\nFor example, Diogenes reports that in the Pytho Timon offered\na gloss on the phrase \u2018no more\u2019 (ouden mallon),\nnamely, \u2018determining nothing and withholding assent\u2019\n(9.76). The phrase ouden mallon became a stock Pyrrhonist\nexpression, and occurs several times in connection with Pyrrho\u2019s\nown views. But is Timon here giving his own distinctive explanation of\nthe significance of this phrase? Given the meager evidence available,\nwe cannot hope to settle the matter. As noted earlier, the passage of\nAristocles that expounds the early Pyrrhonist position is also\ncontroversial in this respect. While the passage\u00a0as a whole has\ngenerally been taken to be giving us the philosophy of\nPyrrho\u00a0(via the medium of a summary by Timon), it has also been\nsuggested\u00a0that large parts of the position outlined here are in\nfact additions by Timon to a core idea of Pyrrho\u2019s (see the\nentry on Pyrrho for details, also Brunschwig (1994), Marchard (2018)).\nSince so much of what we know about Pyrrho comes through Timon, the\nline between these two possibilities is often very difficult to\ndraw.\n\nThere are, though, two cases where it seems clear that Timon is\nspeaking for himself rather than reproducing the thoughts of Pyrrho.\nSextus (M 3.2) reports a comment (from Timon\u2019s On\nthe Physicists) about the legitimacy of using hypotheses. He also\ntwice reports a remark of Timon about divisibility and time\n(M 6.66, 10.197\u2014the wording is not quite identical, but\nit is clearly the same thought in both places); it is a reasonable\nsupposition that this too came from On the Physicists,\nalthough Sextus does not say so. Now in both cases Timon is involved\nin a very different kind of activity from anything attested for\nPyrrho. He is intervening in technical philosophical debates; the very\nconcepts at issue make this clear. But as we saw earlier,\nphilosophical debate was something that Pyrrho rigorously avoided;\nthis was emphasized by Timon himself as one of the main sources of his\ntranquility. Again, it appears that Timon does not entirely live up to\nthe ideal that he ascribes to his teacher.\n\nBeyond the fact that these are Timon\u2019s own ideas, the amount\nthat we can learn from Sextus\u2019 reports is less than one might\nhave hoped. On the subject of hypothesis, he simply tells us that\nTimon regarded it as a question of primary importance whether anything\nshould be assumed by hypothesis. The practice of assuming things by\nhypothesis appears to have had its original home in geometry, and it\nis not surprising that the remark is cited at the beginning of\nSextus\u2019 Against the Geometers. But the occurrence of\nthe remark in a work called Against the Physicists may\nsuggest that Timon had in mind a notion of unargued assumption that\nwas not restricted to any particular subject-matter. In any case, it\nis a fair conjecture that Timon\u2019s implied answer to the question\nwas \u2018no\u2019; accepting things by hypothesis is equivalent to\naccepting them without grounds, and this is a highly dubious\nprocedure. If so, Timon anticipates the Mode from Hypothesis, which is\none of the Five Modes of the later Pyrrhonists (and where the notion\nof hypothesis has lost its specific link with geometry).\n\nThe other claim that Sextus attributes to Timon is that no process\ndivisible into temporal parts\u2014such as coming into being,\nperishing, and the like\u2014can take place in an indivisible time.\nSextus uses this as an argument for the conclusion that the present is\nnot indivisible; but there is no clear indication that this was\nTimon\u2019s purpose as well. The claim itself is unobjectionable,\nindeed almost tautological; one can imagine numerous contexts in\ndebates about the nature of time in which it might have had a point.\nSome scholars have sought to link it to doctrines current in the\nimmediately preceding period, including those of Timon\u2019s first\nteacher Stilpo of Megara. But again, it is hard to connect such a\ntrivially true statement with any definite philosophical position. If\nTimon retained any of Stilpo\u2019s teachings, they were most likely\nin the area of ethics; Stilpo, and the Megarians generally, seem to\nhave espoused an ideal of mild or moderate feeling and freedom from\ndisturbance that is recognizably akin to Pyrrho\u2019s\ntranquility.\n",
