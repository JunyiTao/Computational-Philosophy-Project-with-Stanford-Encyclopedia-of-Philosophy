Religious Philosophers and Speculative Atheists\n\nInterpretations of Hume\u2019s philosophy of religion are often made\nagainst the background of more general interpretations of his\nphilosophical intentions. From this perspective, it is not unusual to\nview Hume\u2019s views on religion in terms of the\n skepticism\n and\n naturalism\n that feature prominently in his Treatise of Human Nature\n(1739\u201340), his first and most ambitious philosophical work.\nAccording to an earlier scholarly consensus, prevalent throughout much\nof the twentieth century, Hume removed almost all the material in the\nTreatise that was concerned with religion because he was\nanxious to avoid offending the religious establishment. In his later\nworks, beginning with the Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1748), Hume began to present his views on this\nsubject in a more substantial and direct manner. This culminates in\nhis Natural History of Religion (1757) and Dialogues\nConcerning Natural Religion (1779; published posthumously)\n\u2013 both of which are entirely on religion. The linkage between\nthese various works, on this earlier scholarly account, is that the\nlater writings on religion are simply an extension and application of\nthe sceptical and naturalistic principles that Hume developed in his\nearlier writings.\n\nIn more recent scholarship, there has been a growing awareness that\nthe earlier scholarly consensus seriously underestimates the\nirreligious content and aims of Hume\u2019s earlier work -\nparticularly in the Treatise. Moreover, the earlier consensus\nis liable to overlook the way in which 17th and\n18th century theological controversies and debates\nstructure and shape Hume\u2019s entire philosophy \u2014 not just\nhis philosophy of religion. Put another way, Hume\u2019s philosophy\nof religion is now increasingly viewed as integral to his entire\nphilosophical system, rather than as an extraneous outgrowth or\nextension of earlier concerns and commitments that lack any specific\nirreligious motivation or orientation.\n\nIn the opening paragraph of the last section of the first\nEnquiry (XII) Hume observes that the central philosophical\ndebate of his day was waged between \u201cspeculative\natheist[s]\u201d and \u201creligious philosophers\u201d over the\nquestion of the existence of God (EU.149/12.1).\n\nThis observation highlights that the central debate that shapes\nHume\u2019s views on the subject of religion was not the\nempiricist/rationalist controversy or its\n\u201cBritish\u201d/\u201ccontinental\u201d correlate (this\ninfluential but misguided approach to early modern philosophy was\nintroduced by nineteenth century German scholarship in the wake of\nKant\u2019s \u201cCopernican Revolution\u201d in epistemology; see\nVanzo 2016), but rather a more fundamental dispute between\nphilosophical defenders of Christian belief and their\n\u201catheistic\u201d opponents. It is this divide over issues of\nreligion that is especially important for understanding the positions\nand arguments that Hume presents throughout his philosophical\nwritings.\n\nDuring the 17th and early 18th centuries British\nphilosophy gave rise to two powerful but conflicting philosophical\noutlooks. On one hand, this era has been described as \u201cthe\ngolden period of English theology\u201d (Stephen 1962, 66) because of\nthe deepening alliance between philosophy and theology. It was, in\nparticular, a major concern of a number of divines at this time to\nshow that basic Christian theology could be provided with a rational\ndefence \u2014 one that would ward off all threat of scepticism and\natheism. Among the leading representatives of this tradition were\nHenry More, Ralph Cudworth,\n John Locke,\n Samuel Clarke,\n George Berkeley\n and Joseph Butler. (More and\nCudworth were both\n Cambridge Platonists.)\n On the other hand, in opposition to this Christian tradition, there\nexisted a sceptical tradition of which the greatest representative was\n Thomas Hobbes.\n Closely aligned with Hobbes was the work of Benedict Spinoza, whose\nTheological-Political Treatise (1670) and Ethics\n(1677) pursued a number of perceived Hobbesean themes in a more\nexplicit and radical fashion, including anti-clericalism, biblical\ncriticism, scepticism about miracles, materialism and necessitarianism\n(see Israel 2001). Almost all the defenders of basic Christian\ntheology during this period had their arguments targeted against the\n\u201catheistic\u201d doctrines of Hobbes and Spinoza.\n\nAnother important source of motivation for \u201catheistic\u201d or\nirreligious thought during this period was the sceptical philosophy of\nPyrrho, as presented in the writings of Sextus Empiricus.\n Pierre Bayle\n describes the significance of Pyrrhonianism in his influential\nHistorical and Critical Dictionary (1697, 2nd ed. 1702), a\nwork that we know was read carefully by the young Hume. In his article\non \u201cPyrrho\u201d Bayle argues that whereas \u201cnatural\nsciences\u201d and \u201cthe state\u201d have no reason to be\nafraid of Pyrrhonism, things stand otherwise as regards \u201cdivine\nscience\u201d (i.e. theology) and \u201creligion,\u201d for the\nlatter, he says, require \u201ccertainty,\u201d and so\n\u201ccollapse\u201d when subjected to Pyrrhonian skepticism (Bayle,\nDictionary, Note B; p. 195).\n\nBayle\u2019s own view that philosophy and theology should be sharply\nseparated, on the ground that the doctrines of theology could not be\ndefended by reason and were therefore a matter of faith alone, brought\nhis work under the suspicion of atheism. In general, it was common\namong Hume\u2019s immediate predecessors and contemporaries to\nassociate scepticism closely with atheism. (Hume\u2019s writings\nallude to this at various points. See, e.g., MEM, Sect. II, #40; and\nD, Introduction.)\n\nA significant development in the late 17th century relating\nto the war against the perceived atheism of Hobbes, Spinoza, and their\nfollowers was the establishment of the Boyle Lectures in 1691. These\nlectures, founded by the distinguished scientist Robert Boyle, served\nthe purpose of defending basic Christian theology against\n\u201cnotorious Infidels,\u201d in particular atheists (see\nMacIntosh 2006) \u2014 a project that had considerable overlap with\nthe project outlined half a century earlier by Descartes in the Letter\nof Dedication of the Meditations on First Philosophy (1641).\nBy the early 18th century the Boyle lectures had become the\nfocus for the debate between religious philosophers (amongst which the\nNewtonians emerged as particularly important and influential) and\nspeculative atheists. The most influential of the Boyle lecturers was\nSamuel Clarke, who was a close friend of Newton\u2019s and widely\nrecognized as the most able defender of Newtonian philosophy and\ntheology. Clarke\u2019s Boyle lectures, published in 1704 as A\nDemonstration of the Being and Attributes of God, developed an\nelaborate version of the cosmological argument (or \u201cargument\na priori\u201d as it was then called), an argument then very\nmuch in vogue, having been sketched in influential books like John\nLocke\u2019s Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690).\nLocke and Clarke took the cosmological argument to be capable of\ndemonstrating the existence of God with mathematical certainty.\nClarke\u2019s version of this argument enjoyed considerable prestige\nthroughout the first half of the 18th century and found\nstrong support among several Scottish philosophers of considerable\nreputation at this time. In addition to the cosmological argument, the\ndesign argument was also widely endorsed by religious philosophers and\nscientists at this time, including Newton himself. It is these two\nalleged proofs for the existence of God that Hume\u2019s\nphilosophical writings are particularly concerned with\ndiscrediting.\n\nHume\u2019s Scottish contemporaries were heavily involved in the\ngeneral British debate between \u201creligious philosophers\u201d\nand \u201cspeculative atheists.\u201d Prominent Scottish defenders\nof Clarke-inspired cosmological arguments included Andrew Baxter, and\nprominent Scottish defenders of design arguments included the\nNewtonians George Cheyne and Colin Maclaurin. There is little doubt\nthat Hume was well aware of these figures; he was a student at\nEdinburgh University in the 1720s, where Maclaurin was professor, and\nas a young man he lived in the Borders area of Scotland, where Baxter\nwas active.\n\nIn Hume\u2019s own lifetime his philosophy was widely viewed by\nScottish, English and Continental critics in both Scotland and England\nas being \u201catheistic\u201d in character and generally hostile to\nreligion, not only on account of late writings like the\nDialogues, but also on account of Hume\u2019s early\nwritings, including the Treatise. One of the most significant\ndevelopments in recent Hume scholarship is the rehabilitation of this\nearlier view.\n",
