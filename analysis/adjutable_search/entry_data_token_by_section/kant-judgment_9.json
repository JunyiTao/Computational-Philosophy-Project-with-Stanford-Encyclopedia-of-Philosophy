    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of Judgment: Transcendental Idealism || Is Kant a verificationist?\n3.2 Is Kant a verificationist?\n\nOne important critical question that needs to be raised is whether, in\nview of the strongest version of his transcendental idealism,\nKant\u2019s theory of judgment is reductionist in some basic\nrespects, and in particular whether he reduces the meaning or\npropositional content of a judgment to a rule for confirming or\ndisconfirming the assertion of that propositional content in the\ntribunal of sensory experience. This is of course the thesis of\nverificationism. Several important Kant commentators\u2014e.g., Bird\n1962, Strawson 1966, and Stroud 1968\u2014have held that Kant\u2019s\ntheory of judgment is verificationist. Familiar problems with\nverificationism include its susceptibility to epistemic skepticism,\nits commitment to an implausible coherence theory of truth, and\nspecific difficulties about how to confirm or disconfirm judgments\nabout the non-immediate past or future.\n\nIt cannot be denied that there are some verificationist strands in\nKant\u2019s theory. For one thing, his \u201ccriterion of empirical\ntruth\u201d (see Section 1.3 above) is in effect verificationist.\nMoreover, to the extent that both Kant\u2019s theory of\ntranscendental truth and also his verificationism are anti-realist and\njudgment-based, there is at least an elective affinity if not\nprecisely an equivalence between the two doctrines. Nevertheless, Kant\nis not a reductionist about meaning. In other words, he is not\ncommitted to the thesis that the propositional content of a judgment\nis nothing but a rule for confirming or disconfirming the\nassertion of that propositional content in the tribunal of sensory\nexperience. While he does seem to be committed to the thesis that the\npropositional content of a judgment will be empirically meaningful or\nobjectively valid only if it contains a rule for confirming\nor disconfirming the assertion of that propositional content in the\ntribunal of sensory experience, this does not by any means exhaust the\npropositional content of that judgment. Over and above its\nverificationist element, the propositional content of every judgment\nalso contains a \u201cthick\u201d or non-deflationary\ncorrespondence-relation to relatively external or extrinsic actual\nfacts (see Section 1.3 above). Furthermore the propositional content\nof every judgment contains a set of a priori logical forms deriving\nfrom the pure understanding, as well as a higher-order a priori\nrational subjective unity deriving from the faculty for apperception\nor rational self-consciousness (see Section 2.1.1 above). What this\nmeans is that Kant is at most a weak verificationist, and that the\nverificationist elements of his theory of judgment are significantly\ntempered by his semantic non-reductionism, his empirical realism, and\nhis mitigated rationalism.\n\nA more complete picture of Kant\u2019s metaphysics of judgment is\nobtained by sketching in accounts of judgments of experience and\ntranscendental judgments. These are discussed in the following\nsupplementary document:\n\nCompleting the Picture of Kant\u2019s Metaphysics of Judgment\n\n",
