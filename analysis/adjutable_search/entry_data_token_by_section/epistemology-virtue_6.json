    "main_text": "Credit\n7. Credit\n\nAs we reviewed in the sections on knowledge and epistemic value, a\nvery popular thesis in VE is that knowledge is a credit-worthy state\nof the agent. You know only if you deserve credit for believing the\ntruth. Call this \u201cthe credit thesis\u201d. The credit thesis\nhelps explain knowledge\u2019s value. It also features prominently in\nattempts to resolve the Gettier problem and explain epistemic\nluck.\n\nJennifer Lackey (2007) argues that we do not deserve credit for\neverything we know, so (a) standard VE definitions of knowledge are\nfalse, and (b) VE is not ideally suited to explain knowledge\u2019s\nvalue. She presents counterexamples involving testimonial and innate\nknowledge. On Lackey\u2019s understanding, to earn credit for a true\nbelief, your \u201creliable cognitive faculties\u201d must be\n\u201cthe most salient part\u201d of the explanation for why you\nbelieve the truth (Lackey 2007: 351; see also Greco 2003: 130).\nCognitive faculties cannot be merely necessary or important parts of\nthe explanation, she argues, because then Gettier problems would\nimmediately arise (Lackey 2007: 347\u20138).\n\nHere is a close variant of one of Lackey\u2019s cases (Lackey 2007:\n352), which she later (2009) calls \u201cChicago Visitor\u201d:\nMorris just arrived at the Chicago train station and wants directions\nto the Sears Tower. He approaches the first adult passerby he sees\n(\u201cPasserby\u201d) and asks for directions. Passerby knows the\ncity extraordinarily well and articulately offers impeccable\ndirections: the tower is two blocks east of the station. On that basis\nMorris unhesitatingly forms the corresponding true belief.\n\nLackey reasons as follows. Morris clearly gains knowledge of the\ntower\u2019s location. But Passerby\u2019s contribution is most\nsalient in explaining why Morris learned the truth. Morris\u2019s\ncontribution to the process is minimal. Morris\u2019s reliable\ncognitive faculties are not the most salient part of the explanation\nfor why he believes the truth. So he doesn\u2019t deserve credit. But\nhe knows nonetheless. So the credit thesis is false.\n\nLackey also asks us to consider \u201cthe possibility of natural\ninnate knowledge\u201d (Lackey 2007: 358). Surely such knowledge is\npossible, so an adequate theory of knowledge must accommodate the\npossibility. But \u201cit seems highly unlikely that a subject would\ndeserve credit for such knowledge\u201d. For the belief\u2019s\norigin, \u201csuch as natural selection or some other evolutionary\nmechanism\u201d, would be the most salient part of the explanation\nfor why you had the true belief. So the credit thesis is false.\n\nSosa (2007: 95) responds that Morris still deserves \u201cpartial\ncredit\u201d, even though his success in believing the truth is\nprimarily attributable to a \u201csocially seated competence\u201d\nembodied in the people involved in the testimonial chain. This\nsuffices for his belief to be apt, and thus count as knowledge.\nPartial credit grounded in apt performance is a perfectly general\nphenomenon, as common in team sport as in testimony.\n\n\nThe quarterback\u2019s pass derives from his competence, but its\ngreat success, its being a touchdown pass manifests more\nfully the team\u2019s competence.\n\n\nRiggs (2009: 209) responds that it isn\u2019t clear that Morris does\nknow where the tower is. We aren\u2019t compelled to count as\nknowledge every \u201ccasual, unreflective acceptance of\ntestimony\u201d (Riggs 2009: 214). And notice that if we continue the\nstory by having someone soon afterward ask Morris where the tower is,\nhe\u2019d be out of line to simply assert, \u201cIt\u2019s two\nblocks that way\u201d, which suggests that he doesn\u2019t really\nknow after all (Riggs 2009: 210\u201311). Beyond that, Riggs\ndistinguishes two senses of credit: praiseworthiness and\nattributability. Knowledge requires that your true belief be\nattributable to you as an agent, but not that you be praiseworthy for\nit. Riggs claims that Lackey\u2019s objections wrongly suppose that\ndefenders of the credit thesis think that knowledge requires\npraiseworthiness, are too closely tied to Greco\u2019s particular\naccount of credit (with its emphasis on explanatory salience), and\nalso overlook the possibility of \u201cgroup effort\u201d in\nachievements.\n\nGreco (2007) responds that Morris still deserves credit for learning\nthe truth. Credit for cooperative success can accrue to multiple\nindividuals, even ones who contribute less than others. It generally\nrequires only that your \u201cefforts and abilities\u201d be\n\u201cappropriately involved\u201d in the success (Greco 2007:\n65).   Further\ndeveloping this idea, Greco points out that\nintellectual virtues are often social virtues, exercised in social\nenvironments.  For example, various social-cognitive abilities\nare involved in assessments of speaker competence and sincerity, and\nso important for the reception of testimony.  A different kind of\nresponse proposes that knowledge-producing virtues are often seated\nnot in the individual knower, but in the broader intellectual\ncommunity. On such occasion, knowledge continues to be understood\nas \u201cproduced from virtue,\u201d but the virtues in questions\nare now community virtues rather than those of an individual\nknower. By far, the most common analogy for such approaches is\nteamwork in sports (Green 2017). Let\nus distinguish between a) several individuals constituting a group\nagent, which agent is in turn the locus of group intentions and\nactions, and b) several individual agents doing something\ntogether.  The latter kind of cooperation is often referred to as\n\u201cshared\u201d or \u201cjoint\u201d agency, as distinguished\nfrom group agency. Greco (2020) uses a joint agency framework to\nunderstand testimonial knowledge. The guiding idea is that the\ntransmission of knowledge from speaker to hearer involves the kind of\ncooperation that constitutes joint agency. On this view, the\nresulting testimonial knowledge is not attributable to the\ncompetent individual agency of the hearer, but rather to the competent\njoint agency of speaker and hearer acting together. In that\nsense, transmitted knowledge is understood as a joint achievement\nrather than an individual achievement. \n Greco\u2019s account of knowledge transmission accommodates a\nstrong notion of social epistemic dependence. This is because joint\nagency in general involves dependence among the cooperating actors to\n\u201cdo their part\u201d in the cooperative activity. Moreover, as\nin other cases of joint action, the hearer has no guarantee that the\nspeaker will prove dependable, no guarantee that the speaker will play\ntheir part well. Finally, we may note that much of the forgoing\ndiscussion about knowledge transmission can be extended to knowledge\ngeneration as well. That is, the production of knowledge can sometimes\ninvolve the kind of intentional cooperation that characterizes joint\nactivity. For example, we can conceive of a research team that\ncooperates in an investigation that is too complicated for any one\nperson to undertake alone. If that cooperation is structured in the\nright way, and if the knowledge so produced is attributable to that\ncooperation, we will have cases in which the production of knowledge\nis a joint achievement.\n\nLackey (2009) replies to Greco, Riggs, and Sosa. Her response is\nsubtle and multidimensional, but its centerpiece is a dilemma for\nVE\u2019s credit thesis. Either VE\u2019s notion of creditworthiness\nis substantial enough to rule out credit for Gettier subjects or it\nisn\u2019t. If it is substantial enough, then it rules out too much\ntestimonial knowledge, in which case it fails. If it isn\u2019t\nsubstantial enough, then it suffers refutation by Gettier cases, in\nwhich case it still fails. Either way, it fails. (Compare Kvanvig\n2003; Pritchard 2008b.)\n",
