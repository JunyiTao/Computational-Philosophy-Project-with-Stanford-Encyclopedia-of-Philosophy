Efforts to increase procreative autonomy\u2014particularly\nthrough biotechnology\u2014risk meddling with such ways of life\n(Sandel 2007). Thus, communitarian conservatives view ART with\nsuspicion. The 20th-century record of Nazi\n\u201ceugenics\u201d programs, forced abortion as a\npopulation-control mechanism, and widespread nonconsensual\nsterilization in many countries, including the United States, is\nadduced as support for pessimism about technological, policy-driven,\nor self-indulgent interventions in procreation (Meilaender 1987).\n\nCommunitarian conservatives typically oppose the use of ART. They also\ncriticize talk of rights in discussion of procreation and parent-child\nrelations. As Murray writes: \u201cProcreative liberty\u2019s\nproblems began when it appropriated the abstract principle\u2014the\nright to choose\u2014and ripped it out of the rich context that\nprovided its moral heft\u201d (Murray 2002, 42).\n\nCommunitarian conservatives need not deny that persons have a strong\ninterest in autonomy regarding procreative decisions. The point is\nthat this interest is both generated and delimited by a particular\ncommunal context. They believe there is no right to reproductive\nautonomy, because reproductive choices gain their meaning and value\nfrom this context.\n\nSome philosophers argue for limiting the moral right to procreate to\nmarried or long-term male-female couples on harm-based grounds (Almond\n2006). Some claim that same-sex and single parenting harm children.\nWhile the empirical debate cannot be addressed here, there seems to be\na lack of evidence that same-sex parenting harms children. For\nexample, an American Sociological Association review finds a\n\u201cclear consensus in the social science literature\u201d that\nchildren of same-sex parents are no worse off than children of\ndifferent-sex parents (see Manning et al., 2014). In any case, since\nevidence suggests that high-conflict families or divorce can harm\nchildren, such arguments risk inconsistency if not applied to\nmale-female couples at risk of divorce or sub-par parenting.\n",
