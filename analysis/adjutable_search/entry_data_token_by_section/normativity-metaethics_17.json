We are agents, and cannot help\nbut be agents, performing actions (Korsgaard 1996).\n\nDavid Velleman (2000) considers the idea that the key to\nunderstanding normativity in action is to discover what stands to\naction as truth stands to belief. It is constitutive of belief that it\naims at the truth. Truth is normative for belief. That is, roughly,\nbeliefs ought to be true, and a believer is subject to a requirement\nto be responsive to the truth. Similarly, perhaps, it is constitutive\nof action that it aims at the good. The good is normative for action.\nThat is, actions ought to promote the good, and a person who acts is\nsubject to a requirement to be responsive to the good. Velleman\nargues, however, for the different idea that it is constitutive of\nagency that agents have the aim of knowing what they\nare doing. Self-knowledge is the constitutive aim of\naction. Further, Velleman argues, this determines the criterion\nof success in action, which in turn determines which\nconsiderations count as reasons for action.\n\nChristine Korsgaard has proposed (1996), roughly, that in order to\ncount as an action, something done by a person must be done for a\nreason, and this means it must accord with norms that any rational\nagent could accept. Given what actions are, one can act only if one\nacts in accord with such norms.\n\nThese ideas could be interpreted as offering, or at least pointing in\nthe direction of, constitutive accounts of normativity. The basic idea\nwould be that it is constitutive of a fact\u2019s being normative in\nrelation to action or belief that the fact be appropriately related to\nthe essence of action or belief, respectively.\n\nOne response to proposals of these kinds is that, if agency is\nunderstood as these philosophers suggest, then agency is optional.\nThat is, perhaps, a person can opt out of the aim to have\nself-knowledge, or to do things that accord with norms of practical\nreason, by opting to do things that do not count as actions in the\npreferred sense that these proposals spell out. See David Enoch\n(2006).\n\nA different response points out that, on these accounts, the concept\nof action itself turns out to be normative in a covert way, for, on\nthese accounts, it is of the essence of action that it aim at\nself-knowledge, or that it must accord with norms of practical reason.\nBut the idea that an aim is non-optional is arguably\nnormative, as is the idea of norms of practical reason. Hence,\narguably, these accounts do not explain what normativity consists\nin. They rather change the explanandum from the nature of normativity\nto the nature of agency or action.\n",
