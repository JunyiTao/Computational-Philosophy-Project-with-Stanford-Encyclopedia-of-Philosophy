    "preamble": "\n\nPhilosophical reflection on religion is as old as Greek questions\nabout Hebrew stories. Feminist philosophy of religion is a more recent\ndevelopment within Western philosophy that poses feminist questions\nabout religious texts, traditions, and practices, often with the aim\nof critiquing, redefining, or reconstructing the entire field in light\nof gender studies. Feminist philosophy of religion is important to\nfeminist and nonfeminist philosophy alike for providing a critical\nunderstanding of various religious concepts, beliefs, and rituals, as\nwell as of religion as a cultural institution that defines, sanctions,\nand sometimes challenges gender roles and gender-inflected\nrepresentations. It is equally important for feminist theory, which\nfrequently neglects the academic study of religion, as for analytic\nphilosophy of religion, which seldom takes into account gender or race\nor class. This entry considers the work of both critique and\nreconstruction as it has developed in feminist philosophies of\nreligion over the last several decades.\n\nIn the present situation, most practitioners of feminist philosophy of\nreligion and of feminist theology are agreed that their discipline\ncannot be limited simply to a sociological assessment or confessional\nnarrative of what a particular religious group believes to be true,\nwithout consideration of the difference that gender makes. Because\nfeminist philosophy of religion is philosophical, it can take\nas primary neither the datum of scriptures believed to be revealed and\nself-authenticating nor the self-privileging endeavor of intratextual\ntheologies. Because it is philosophy of religion, a subject\nmatter that encompasses a broad array of cross-cultural material, it\ncannot be concerned simply with themes or questions drawn from the\nChristian religion alone. And because it is feminist, it must\npromote the elimination of gender inequality and take into account the\nmultiplicity of human bodies, desires, and differences that are mapped\nonto the site of religion. At the same time, it cannot presume that\nreligion exists as some common universal underlying all the various\ntraditions; only particular religions exist, and even the very concept\nof religion itself has come to be recognized as a modern and Western\nconcept.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nTo date, a much larger literature exists under the rubric of feminist\ntheology than of feminist philosophy of religion. Four main reasons\nhave been suggested for this (Frankenberry & Thie 1994: 2\u20134). First, from the\nseventeenth to the nineteenth century, the perspective of white\nEuropean males dominated the formative period of philosophy of\nreligion to such an extent that it was hard to see how the distortions\nof this long tradition might be overcome. Second, in the twentieth\ncentury, once philosophy of religion was professionalized and\ngerrymandered within Philosophy faculties at universities, it was\ninsulated both from the old Theology faculties and the new Religious\nStudies faculties created in the 1960s and 1970s; therefore, feminists\ninterested in pursuing a Ph.D. had to choose between Philosophy (where\nphilosophy of religion was not regarded as \u201creal\u201d\nphilosophy during the ascendancy of the analytic movement) or\nReligious Studies/Theology which took philosophical concerns seriously\nand thus provided a more welcoming location for feminist theorizing on\nreligion. Third, many feminist philosophers themselves have harbored\neither a suspicion of religion or an impoverished understanding of it,\nand so have been slow to develop a significant body of scholarship in\nthis area. Fourth, the entrenched bias and resistance to feminism\nwithin mainstream analytic philosophy of religion, combined with the\nmyth that its methods, norms, and content are gender-neutral, has\nimpeded recognition of the relevance of work appearing under the\nrubric of feminist philosophy of religion. Feminist theology, on the\nother hand, flourishes in an academic field that for over forty years\nhas been hospitable to a variety of liberation theologies,\ndeath-of-god theologies, environmental theologies, postcolonialist\ntheologies, and queer\n studies.[1]\n\n\nThe maturing of feminist philosophy of religion as a field distinct\nfrom feminist theology was evident at the end of the twentieth\ncentury. It could be seen in the appearance of two book-length\nstudies: Pamela Anderson\u2019s A Feminist Philosophy of Religion: The\nRationality and Myths of Religious Belief (1998), and Grace\nJantzen\u2019s Becoming Divine: Towards a Feminist Philosophy of\nReligion (1999). Another measure of the vitality of this field\nwas the publication of such collections as Feminist\nInterpretations of Mary Daly (Hoagland & Frye 2000), devoted\nto an assessment of one of the most original authors in the field, and\nFeminist Interpretations of Soren Kierkegaard (Leon &\nWalsh 1997), containing critical analyses by feminist philosophers of\nthe \u201cfather of religious existentialism\u201d. In addition,\nVolume 1 of Kluwer\u2019s Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of\nReligion (Long 2000), a major reference work covering\n1900\u20132000, concluded with a chapter on feminist philosophy of\nreligion as represented by Mary Daly, Sally McFague, Luce Irigaray,\nJulia Kristeva, Pamela Anderson, and Grace Jantzen. Finally, an\nanthology on Feminist Philosophy of Religion: Critical\nReadings (Anderson & Clack 2004) exhibited the methodological\nrange of the field in terms of psychoanalytic, poststructuralist,\npostmetaphysical, and epistemological frameworks, and provided\nspecialized treatments of such topics as divinity, embodiment,\nautonomy and spirituality, and religious practice.\n\nIn the second decade of the twenty-first century, fresh collections\nare appearing more frequently as essays by feminists bearing on the\nphilosophy of religion become available (see Anderson 2010; Alcoff\n& Caputo 2011).\n2. Feminist Critique of Traditional Philosophy of Religion\n\nTo Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1885 it was evident that \u201cHistory\nshows that the moral degradation of woman is due more to theological\nsuperstitions than to all other influences together\u201d (1885:\n389). To Luce Irigaray, writing one hundred years later, the becoming\nof women was premised on becoming divine, for \n\n\nGod alone can save us, keep us safe. The feeling or experience of a\npositive, objective, glorious existence, the feeling of subjectivity,\nis essential for us. Just like a God who helps us and leads us in the\npath of becoming, who keeps track of our limits and infinite\npossibilities\u2014as women\u2014who inspires our projects. (1987\n[1993b: 67]) \n\n\nScalding critiques like Stanton\u2019s and reconstructive reflections like\nIrigaray\u2019s have marked feminist philosophy of religion with a complex\nset of relations to the subject matter of religion, as well as to the\ndiscipline of philosophy. In the wake of a worldwide wave of religious\nresurgence at the beginning of the twenty-first century, many\nfeminists find Stanton\u2019s reasoning still persuasive: the Word of God\nis the word of man, used to keep women in subjection and to hinder\ntheir emancipation. For other feminists, especially those located\nwithin various communities of faith and resistance, gynocentric\nefforts to create a possible space for something \u201cdivine\u201d\nhold considerable appeal.\n\nAs a form of critique, feminist philosophy of religion employs the\npractice described by Jeffner Allen and Iris Marion Young (1989) of showing the limits of a\nmode of thinking by forging an awareness of alternative, more\nliberating, ideas, symbols, and discourses. Feminist philosophy of\nreligion suggests ways in which gender as an analytic category and\ngender studies as a body of knowledge can not only challenge but also\nenrich and inform the methodological and substantive assumptions of\nphilosophy of religion. This does not mean that gender hierarchy\ncomprises a simple or exclusive category of analysis. Nor does it\nnecessarily invoke a distinction between gender and sex that would\nallow naturalized assumptions about the sexed body to go unquestioned.\nGiven the interflowing streams of class, race, ethnicity, age, sexual\norientation, ability, and nationality that shape the complex\nmodalities of social experience, it is unlikely that gender or any\nother single factor could suffice as a single or unitary focal point.\nWomen cannot be presumed to speak in a single voice or to share a\nuniform \u201cexperience\u201d. Nevertheless, gender constitutes\nperhaps the most fundamental factor creating human difference, and it\nremains among the most ignored philosophically.\n\nGender bias as it operated in the history of the philosophy of\nreligion shaped the ways in which the traditional problems and\norientations of the field were constructed. Like the cultural\nphenomenon of religion itself, philosophy of religion not only\noriginated in a male tradition of production and transmission, with a\nhistory of excluding and devaluing women, but it was also defined by\nmany concepts and symbols marked as \u201cmasculine\u201d, which\nstood in oppositional relation to those marked as\n\u201cfeminine\u201d. Moreover, unlike the phenomenon of religion\nwhich was embedded in multiple cultural contexts, philosophy of\nreligion was largely Eurocentric and Anglo-American in its\norientation, such that in addition to gender bias, ethnocentrism\nconstituted the second major weakness of the history of this field.\nFor a long time, philosophy of religion was written from a standpoint\nnot unlike that of Reverend Thwackum, the character in Henry\nFielding\u2019s novel Tom Jones, who announced: \n\n\nWhen I mention religion, I mean the Christian religion; and not only\nthe Christian religion, but the Protestant religion; and not only the\nProtestant religion, but the Church of England. (Fielding 1749: vol.\n1, bk 3, ch. 3) \n\n\nIf not always the Church of England, it was for the most part\nProtestant Christianity that was conflated with \u201creligion\u201d\nin the modern period of philosophy of religion.\n\nUndaunted by two such severe deficiencies\u2014gender bias and\nethnocentrism\u2014the dominant Anglo-American analytic school of\nphilosophy of religion proved surprisingly healthy in the last decades\nof the twentieth century. Whereas at the mid-point of the twentieth\ncentury philosophy of religion was virtually defined by the\nassumptions and methods of logical positivism and empiricism, in\nsubsequent years new and technically rigorous contributions by\nreligiously committed philosophers began to enliven old theistic\narguments. After long decades of dormancy when logical positivism\nseemed to yield only negative conclusions in the philosophy of\nreligion, a resurgence of interest in traditional theism occurred in\nmainstream philosophy of religion. Modal logic was used to formulate a\nmore perspicacious version of the ontological argument, Bayesian\nmodels of probability breathed new life into inductive justifications\nof religious belief, rational choice theory ushered Pascal\u2019s wager\nonce again onto the philosophical stage, and language-game analysis\noffered a prima facie justification of religious language.\nFar from the days of wondering what Athens has to do with Jerusalem,\nphilosophy and religion appeared to have entered a period of detente\nas comrades in arms. From the standpoint of feminist critique,\nhowever, analytic philosophy of religion has failed to engage the\nquestions posed by feminist inquiry or to modify the androcentric\nelements of the traditional theistic model. Instead, in the work of\nsuch philosophers as Richard Swinburne, Alvin Plantinga, and William\nAlston, philosophy of religion was deployed in defense of the cogency\nof a standard form of western monotheism, in the service of a\nconception of \u201cGod\u201d that was patriarchal, and in the\nvested interests of staunchly traditional forms of Christianity.\n\nFeminists argue that philosophy of religion can hardly ignore\nquestions of gender ideology when its very subject\nmatter\u2014religion\u2014is riddled with misogyny and\nandrocentrism. They point out that, historically, gender bias in\nreligion has been neither accidental nor superficial. Elizabeth\nJohnson (1993) likens it to a buried continent whose subaqueous pull\nshaped all the visible landmass; androcentric bias has massively\ndistorted every aspect of the terrain and rendered invisible,\ninconsequential, or nonexistent the experience and significance of\nhalf the human race. For philosophers studying the intellectual\neffects and belief systems of religions, the opportunity to critique\nand correct sexist and patriarchal constructions in this field is as\nample as it is urgent, given the presence of gender ideology in all\nknown religions. Not one of the religions of the world has been\ntotally affirming of women\u2019s personhood. Every one of them conforms to\nHeidi Hartmann\u2019s definition of patriarchy as \n\n\nrelations between men, which have a material base, and which, though\nhierarchical, establish or create interdependence and solidarity among\nmen that enable them to dominate women. (1981: 14) \n\n\nAll sacred literatures of the world display an unvarying ambivalence\non the subject of women. For every text that places well-domesticated\nwomanhood on a religious pedestal, another one announces that, if\nuncontrolled, women are the root of all evil. Religion has thus\ncomprised a primary space in which and by means of which gender\nhierarchy has been culturally articulated, reinforced, and\nconsolidated in institutionalized form. Religion is hardly the only\nsuch space, but it appears to have been a particularly effective way\nof undergirding and sanctifying gender hierarchy in the West.\n\nFeminists charge that gender bias has permeated the way philosophy of\nreligion has been written and has influenced how the field has been\nprofessionalized. They protest a series of common lapses: the dearth\nof female authors in the leading journals or standard textbooks; the\nalmost complete absence of attention to feminist philosophy on the\npart of mainstream authors, male and female; the exclusively\nmale-authored and monochromatic complexion of the standard anthologies\nof readings and editorial boards. They note that the use of inclusive\nlanguage was remarkably slow in finding its way into the scholarly\npublications and conceptual patterns of this field. It is still not\nunusual to find articles that discuss concepts of justice and fairness\nat length, using throughout the male pronoun.\n\nMore difficult lacunae are located in the selection of the very\ntopics, problems, and methods that have come to define mainstream\nphilosophy of religion, chief among them the problem of God.\n3. The Problem of God\n\nDiscussion of the problem of God is standard fare for all schools of\nphilosophy of religion. Long a lynchpin holding up other structures of\npatriarchal rule, the concept of a male God has been judged by every\nmajor feminist thinker, including Mary Daly, Rosemary Radford Ruether,\nNaomi Goldenberg, Daphne Hampson, Judith Plaskow, Julia Kristeva, and\nLuce Irigaray, to be both humanly oppressive and, on the part of\nbelievers, religiously idolatrous according to the terms of their own\ntheologies. Feminist philosophers of religion ask why a single set of\nmale metaphors should be absolutized as though supremely fitting about\nthe subject. Critical of the literary gesture of writers who hope to\navoid sexist language by recourse to rhetorical disclaimers, feminist\nauthors argue that it is not persuasive simply to declare that the\nconcept of God transcends gender and, therefore, \u201che\u201d is\nnot literally male, and then to presume that all can go on as before.\nThe problem remains that once the masculine is raised to the universal\nhuman, beyond gender, the feminine alone bears the burden of sexual\ndifference.\n3.1 Feminist Critique of Traditional Theism\n\nPhilosophers of religion have sometimes marked a distinction between\nthe anthropomorphic language of myth and popular piety, on the one\nhand, and the conceptual and abstract categories of philosophy, on the\nother hand, as though when we repair to the metalevel of analysis we\nleave gender-inflected language behind. Feminist philosophy of\nreligion points to all the ways the signifier \u201cGod\u201d\nremains stubbornly gendered male in Western thought and subliminally\nenvisioned as a male personage. Whether taken as real or unreal,\ninferred validly or invalidly, said to be experienced directly or only\nprojected illusorily, the divine identity in classical theism and\natheism is unmistakably male. This supreme, ruling, judging, and\nloving male God is envisioned as a single, absolute subject, is named\nFather, and is conceived as standing in a relation of hierarchical\ndominion over the world. In ways both implicit and explicit, this\nconstruct tends in turn to justify various social and political\nstructures of patriarchy which exalt solitary human patriarchs at the\nhead of pyramids of power. Drawn almost exclusively from the world of\nruling class men, traditional theistic concepts and images legitimate\nsocial and intellectual structures that grant a theomorphic character\nto men who rule and relegate women, children, and other men to\nmarginalized and subordinated areas. The discursive practices that\nhave constructed the divine as male are intimately connected to the\nproduction of ideologies which devalue all that is not male; they have\nformed a constitutive element in the oppression of women and other\n\u201cOthers\u201d.\n\nThe dominance of male signifiers for deity is only part of the problem\nof classical theism. Like a prism which refracts all the surrounding\nlight, the gendering of God has skewed the way in which other problems\nin philosophy of religion have been traditionally constructed. The\nproblem of religious language, for example, is frequently\ncast in terms of the meaning and use of metaphors and models,\ninvolving questions of reference and truth. But the metaphors and\nmodels employed by mainstream philosophers of religion often trade\nuncritically on intrinsically hierarchical patterns of relations.\nMetaphors such as father, king, lord, bridegroom, husband and\nGod-\u201cHe\u201d go unmarked. If an occasional female model or\nmetaphor intrudes into this homosocial circle, it is immediately\nre-marked upon. Introducing female pronouns for God-\u201cshe\u201d\nproduces nervous laughter in most classrooms.\n\nIn the study of the so-called divine attributes, none has\nreceived more discussion in the literature than\n\u201comnipotence\u201d, defined as some version of \u201cperfect\npower\u201d. Both the conceptualization of the nature of this power\nas well as descriptions of its effects embody sexism and androsexism.\nIn twentieth century studies, the standard definition of perfect\npower ranged from \u201cunilateral power to effect any\nconceivable state of affairs\u201d to the more moderate notion of\n\u201cself-limiting power\u201d. But the kind of power in question\nwas in principle one of domination, or power-over, as it has been\npersistently associated with the characteristics of ideal masculinity.\nIn the eleventh century, Peter Damian could quote approvingly the\nbiblical passage \u201cO Lord, King Omnipotent, all things are placed\nin your power, and there is no one who is able to resist your\nwill\u201d, as he argued, contra St. Jerome, that divine\nomnipotence is even able to \u201ccause a virgin to be restored after\nshe has fallen\u201d (1065 [1969: 143). Like the two favorite heroes\nof modern philosophy, the Cartesian cognitive subject and the Kantian\nautonomous will, an omnipotent deity reflects the mirror image of\nidealized masculinist qualities, according to feminist philosophers of\nreligion.  Among contemporary schools, only process philosophers of\nreligion have explicitly argued against the attribute of omnipotence\non the grounds that it is conceptually incoherent, scientifically\nsuperfluous, and morally offensive in its association of the divine\nwith male controlling power (see, for example, Cobb & Griffin\n1976; Suchocki 1988; Howell 1988).\n\nPhilosophical arguments on behalf of the concept of divine\naseity or self-sufficiency reinforce the characteristic\ndisparagement of reciprocal power relations found in other social and\nintellectual expressions of patriarchy. Divine existence is said to be\ncompletely self-sufficient and sovereign. It is what it is\nindependently of any and all creatures, and its relations to these\nothers are external relations only. But, according to feminist\ncritics, in the absence of internal or constitutive relations that\nwould affect or qualify the divine aseity, real relatedness to\ncreatures is ruled out and a one-sided glorification of impassivity\nover change regulates the model of God and the world.\n\nIn a related way, the topic of theodicy has also been deeply\nshaped by male-defined constructions of power and interest. The very\nform of the question, How can an all-powerful deity permit evil?\nimplies a meaning of \u201call-powerful\u201d that is embedded in a\ndiscourse of domination. At the same time, the meaning of\n\u201call-good\u201d, called into question by the power of evil, is\ndefended by traditional theodicies in ways that either equivocate on\nthe meaning of \u201cgoodness\u201d or cast doubt on the moral\nattributes of the deity. Also exemplary are the types of evil simply\noverlooked in the many hypotheticals, counterexamples, and possible\nworlds that are generated in discussions of theodicy by male\nphilosophers. Misogyny and rape rarely make the list of evils. The\nwhole drift of theodicy as an intellectual exercise gravitates back to\nthe question of God, and rarely to the world of cruelty and suffering\n(Thie 1994; for exceptions, see Farley 1990, and Sands 1994).\n\nPhilosophical debates on the topic of immortality have also\nbeen deeply shaped by androcentric interests\u2014centering on\nself-perpetuation and individual, rather than collective, survival.\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman, arguably a foremother in feminist philosophy\nof religion, located an important gender difference in His\nReligion and Hers (1923). \u201cDeath-based\u201d religion, she\nclaimed, asks the question, \u201cWhat is going to happen to me,\nafter I am dead?\u201d\u2014a posthumous egoism. To this she\njuxtaposed a \u201cbirth-based\u201d religion whose main question is\n\u201cWhat is to be done for the child who is born?\u201d\u2014an\nimmediate altruism. Many contemporary feminist philosophers of\nreligion would find Gilman\u2019s anthropology overly simple but her\nemphasis suggestive.\n\nA still deeper critique involves the differentiation of embedded\nlevels of bias and androcentrism in the crucial assumptions, methods,\nand norms of traditional philosophy of religion. Rooted in an ancient\ndualistic worldview whose philosophical inadequacy has been harder to\ndetect until recently than its social and legalistic inequities,\nWestern religious categories have been inextricably bound up with a\ncertain metaphysical exigency. The metaphysical worldview that once\nsupported the sacred canopy may have lost much of its cogency for the\nmodern mind, along with the arguments of medieval scholastics that\nsailors cannot kiss their wives goodbye on Sundays, or hangmen go to\nheaven, but the dualisms associated with that worldview have continued\nto haunt the philosophical imagination. Beginning with Greek\nphilosophy\u2019s equation of the male principle with mind and reason and\nact, the female principle was associated with the contrasting\nidentification in terms of matter, body, passion and potency. The\nsubsequent history of Western philosophy, despite major conceptual\nshifts, displayed a characteristic logic and form. Taking the form of\nhierarchical opposition, the logic of binary structuring mutually\nopposed such elements as mind and body, reason and passion, object and\nsubject, transcendental and empirical. As argued by any number of\nfeminist philosophers, these hierarchical oppositions are typically\ngender-coded. Body, matter, emotions, instincts, and subjectivity are\ncoded as feminine, while mind, reason, science, objectivity are coded\nas masculine (see Bordo 1987, Harding & Hintikka 1983, Irigaray\n1977 [1985], Lloyd 1985). The specific link between this metaphysics\nand western conceptions of God is a complex chicken-and-egg question.\nCertainly it is fair to say that the Hellenizing of Christian theology\nfrom the second century C.E. on saddled classical theism with\nproblematic philosophical valences. But classical theism in turn\nreinforced and sanctioned the philosophical valorization of mind,\nreason, and male over and against body, passion, and female. Some\nfeminists would trace the cultural roots of this way of thinking to\nthe phenomenon of \u201cmale bodily alienation\u201d that arose in\nlate classical antiquity\u2019s asceticism (see Ruether 1983).\n\nIn any case, insofar as Western monotheism has constructed the meaning\nof \u201cGod\u201d in relation to \u201cworld\u201d around binary\noppositions of mind/body, reason/passion, and male/female, traditional\ntheism remains complicitous with the very system of gender constructs\nand symbolic structures that underlie women\u2019s oppression. In the\nbinary opposition between \u201cGod\u201d and \u201cworld\u201d,\nthe term \u201cGod\u201d occupies the privileged space and acts as\nthe central principle, the One who confers identity to creatures to\nwhom \u201cHe\u201d stands in hierarchical relation. Oppositional\npairing of God/world has served in turn to organize other categories,\nsuch as heaven and earth, sacred and profane. The widespread\ndistinction between sacred and profane, employed by many authors, thus\ncomes already encoded with the hierarchical oppositions of male/female\nand masculine/feminine onto which it is mapped, along with the\nstructurally related pairs, white/black and heterosexual/homosexual.\nThe first term in each pair is sacralized, while the second is\nrendered profane. This set of themes can be traced in connection with\nthe classic work of Durkheim and Weber in their theorizations of\nreligion (Erickson 1993).\n\nContemporary feminist philosophy of religion is also aware that the\nrelation between symbolic structures, on the one hand, and gender\nconstructions, on the other hand, cannot be specified in terms of a\nsingle explanatory model. The power of symbolic orders to invoke and\nreinscribe implicit gender understandings works in varied and complex\nways, as shown in studies by Bynum (1986), Fulkerson (1994), and\nHollywood (1995, 2002). Because religious symbols are polysemic and\nmultivalent, they hold different meanings for different people at\ndifferent times. It is never a simple matter of sheer reflection of\nthe given social order. The relation between society and symbol, or\nbetween psyche and symbol, is recognized as open-ended. Relations of\nreversal or inversion of actual social structures may obtain, making\nit risky for the interpreter to posit a single unidirectional\ncause-effect relation between symbol and social setting. As Bynum\npoints out, meaning is not so much imparted as it is appropriated\n\u201cin a dialectical process whereby it becomes subjective reality\nfor the one who uses the symbol\u201d, allowing for the possibility\nthat \u201cthose with different gender experiences will appropriate\nsymbols in different ways\u201d (1986: 9).\n\nIt follows that no necessary correlation can be assumed between\ngoddess-worshipping cultures and actual egalitarian social structures\nin the lives of females and males of that culture. Similarly, the male\nFather God may open up a range of different interpretative\npossibilities for both women and men. In culturally specific and\nhistorically unstable ways, religious symbols even of the male Father\nGod have been useful in resisting and subverting the social order, not\nonly reflecting and reinforcing it. In light of these considerations,\nmost feminist philosophers of religions regard it as risky to\ngeneralize across cultures, religious traditions, or historical\nperiods with respect to the different ways in which males and females\nappropriate or construct religious symbolism.\n3.2 From Images and Symbols to Concepts and Ontology\n\nMainstream philosophers of religion have so far failed to take\nexplicit account of the gendered dynamics of religious thought, but\nfor forty years a variety of other scholars, including biblical\nexegetes, theologians, ethicists, and feminist philosophers of\nreligion, have produced an extraordinary explosion of research\nresulting in feminist thealogies, critical hermeneutics of suspicion,\nand woman-affirming writings on spirituality. In these, the problem of\nGod appears as a crucial site of reconstruction.\n\nThe medieval theologian Hildegard of Bingen struggled to capture her\nvision of the Spirit of God with a cascade of vivid images and a\nm\u00e9lange of metaphors. As rendered by Elizabeth Johnson in the\nfollowing passage, Hildegard\u2019s vision encompassed many of the themes\nthat appear in the writing of twentieth century feminist writers. The\ndivine spirit, Hildegard wrote, is the very life of the life of all\ncreatures; the way in which everything is penetrated with\nconnectedness and relatedness; a burning fire who sparks, ignites,\ninflames, kindles hearts; a guide in the fog; a balm for wounds; a\nshining serenity; an overflowing fountain that spreads to all sides.\n\n\n\nShe is life, movement, color, radiance, restorative stillness in the\ndin. Her power makes all withered sticks and souls green again with\nthe juice of life. She purifies, absolves, strengthens, heals, gathers\nthe perplexed, seeks the lost. She pours the juice of contrition into\nhardened hearts. She plays music in the soul, being herself the melody\nof praise and joy. She awakens mighty hope, blowing everywhere the\nwinds of renewal in creation.  (paraphrase in Johnson 1992: 127\u2013128) \n\n\nThis, for Hildegard in the 12th century, is the mystery of the God in\nwhom humans live and move and have their being.\n\nEight centuries later, Paula Gunn Allen wrote in similarly provocative\nlanguage of the spirit that pervades her Laguna Pueblo/Sioux peoples:\n\n\n\nThere is a spirit that pervades everything, that is capable of\npowerful song and radiant movement, and that moves in and out of the\nmind. The colors of this spirit are multitudinous, a glowing, pulsing\nrainbow. Old Spider Woman is one name for this quintessential spirit,\nand Serpent Woman is another\u2026and what they together have made\nis called Creation, Earth, creatures, plants and light. (1986: 22)\n\n\nIn Ntozake Shange\u2019s well-known play, a tall black woman rose from\ndespair and cried out, \u201ci found god in myself and i loved her, i\nloved her fiercely\u201d (1976: 63).\n\nIn a frequently cited passage in The Color Purple, Alice\nWalker voiced a similar note as Shug recounted to Celie the epiphany\nthat came over her when she learned to get the old white man off her\neyeball:\n\nIt? I ast.\n\nYeah, It. God ain\u2019t a he or a she, but a It.\n\nBut what do it look like? I ast.\n\nDon\u2019t look like nothing, she say. It ain\u2019t a picture show. It ain\u2019t\nsomething you can look at apart from anything else, including\nyourself. I believe God is everything, say Shug. Everything that is or\never will be. And when you can feel that, and be happy to feel that,\nyou\u2019ve found It (1982: 177\u201378).\n\n\nIn theological constructions, Rosemary Ruether (1983 [1993]) has\nworked with the unpronounceable written symbol \u201cGod/ess\u201d\nto connote the \u201cencompassing matrix of our being\u201d that\ntranscends patriarchal limitations and signals redemptive experience\nfor women as well as for men. Modelling God for a nuclear age, Sallie\nMcFague (1987) has experimented with metaphors of God as Mother,\nLover, and Friend of the world, with the world conceived of as God\u2019s\nown body. Correlating Paul Tillich\u2019s notion of the power of being with\nthe empowerment women know in freeing themselves from patriarchy, the\nearly Mary Daly (1973 [1985]) posited God as \u201cVerb\u201d, a dynamic\nbecoming process that energizes all things. Using process philosophy\u2019s\ncategories, Marjorie Suchocki (1982, 1988) has given new resonance to\nthe meaning of Whitehead\u2019s metaphors of God as \u201cthe lure for\nfeeling\u201d whose \u201cpower of persuasion\u201d aims to effect\njustice and peace. Blurring the lines between psychological, somatic,\nand religious experiences, Ruether (1983 [1993]) has projected an image of\n\u201cthe feminine divine\u201d grounded in the morphology of\nwomen\u2019s bodies in all their multiplicity and fluidity.\n\nIn all these cases, contemporary feminist articulations of a relation\nbetween God and the world, or God and female subjectivity, depicts the\ndivine as continuous with the world rather than radically transcendent\nontologically or metaphysically. Divine transcendence is seen to\nconsist either in total immanence or else in some dialectic between\nhorizontal transcendence and immanence.\n\nBut images and metaphors are not philosophical concepts, and the\nreference range of \u201cthe divine\u201d as it appears in these and\nother feminist writings is not always clear. While theologians are\nfrequently satisfied to work imaginatively with symbols, images, and\nmetaphors, without regard to the question what the symbols are\nsymbolic of, philosophers of religion normally seek more\nprecision and conceptual clarification.\n4. Feminist Reconstructions of Transcendence\n4.1 A Process Feminist Proposal\n\nOn the question of the meaning and reference of God-talk, two\ncontemporary schools of philosophy of religion stand out as apparent\nresources for feminist reconstruction. Both (1) the tradition that\nemploys the classical ontology of being, extending from Thomas Aquinas\nto Paul Tillich and the early Mary Daly, and (2) the tradition that\nemploys an ontology of becoming, extending from Alfred North Whitehead\nto Charles Hartshorne, John Cobb, Jr., David Griffin, Marjorie\nSuchocki, and Catherine Keller, afford systematic conceptual schemes\nfor explicating the metaphors that appear in various contemporary\nwritings concerning \u201cthe divine\u201d and any of its variants,\nsuch as \u201cthe sacred\u201d, \u201cspirit\u201d,\n\u201cGod\u201d, \u201ctranscendence\u201d, or \u201chigher\npower\u201d. Both traditions can be modified, moreover, according to\nqualifications suggested in this section. They can then be understood\nas converging in a single conceptual model, rendered as\n\u201ccreativity\u201d in Whitehead\u2019s system and as\n\u201cbeing\u201d (esse) in Aquinas\u2019s. This model can be\nseen as a coherent way of reconciling the Whiteheadian and the\nThomistic accounts, while also providing a conceptual alternative to\nanthropomorphic images of God as Loving Father, Cosmic Monarch,\nCreator and Intervener, and so forth.\n\nThe school of thought known as process philosophy rewrites philosophy\nof religion in a radically revisionist mode that accents evolution,\norganismic connectedness, and the primacy of becoming. Its theism is\ntermed \u201cpanentheism\u201d, or all-in-god. Process philosophers\nof religion were preeminent among those who labored in the twentieth\ncentury to construct a coherent philosophy of God that would also be\nconsistent with scientific cosmology and evolutionary theory. They\nproduced, in addition, a model relatively free of sexism and\nandrocentrism. The underlying values of the process worldview are\norganic, relational, dynamic, and embodied. Whitehead\u2019s elaboration of\nthe idea that \u201cit is as true to say that God creates the World,\nas that the World creates God\u201d (1929 [1978: 348]) anticipated\nthe themes of interrelatedness and mutual conditioning that feminist\nphilosophy has developed in multiple ways in recent decades.\n\nIn the process paradigm everything comes into being by grasping or\n\u201cprehending\u201d antecedently actualized things to integrate\nthem into a new actualized thing, its own self. Supplanting substance\nphilosophy\u2019s idea that it takes an agent to act, process philosophy\nproposes a model whereby agents are the results of acts and subjects\nare constituted out of relations. Throughout the entire universe, at\nboth macrocosmic and microcosmic levels, quantum units of becoming\nachieve momentary unity out of a given multiplicity in a never-ending\nrhythm of creative process whereby \u201cthe many become one and are\nincreased by one\u201d (1929 [1978: 21]).\n\nCreativity within each occasion is spontaneous, the mark of actuality,\nand free, within the limits determined by its antecedent causes.\nCreativity unifies any many and is creative of a new unifying\nperspective which then becomes one among the many. In a process\nontology, creativity is ultimate reality not in the sense of something\nmore ultimate behind, above, or beyond reality, but in the sense of\nsomething ultimately descriptive of all reality, or what the biologist\nCharles Birch and the theologian John B. Cobb, Jr. have called\n\u201cthe Life Process\u201d (1982). As a category, creativity is the \u201cultimate of\nultimates\u201d in Whitehead\u2019s words, but as such it is an\nabstraction, the formal character of any actual occasion. Creativity\nas concrete, however, signifies a dynamism which is the very actuality\nof things, their act of being there at all. Everything exists in\nvirtue of creativity, but creativity is not any thing,\naccording to process feminist philosophers of religion.\n\nThe idea that the category of the divine or transcendence can be\ncorrelated with the category of creativity in Whitehead\u2019s philosophy\nmarks a departure from Whitehead\u2019s own notion of God as an actual\nentity in process of becoming at the same time that it joins with the\nThomistic tradition that has employed the language of being, rather\nthan becoming, to explicate the meaning of the divine. In its\nclassical medieval synthesis in Aquinas, this tradition conceptualized\nthe divine as esse ipsum, and held that in God essence and\nexistence are one; that is, God\u2019s very nature is esse, to be.\nEverything that exists was thought to do so through participation in\ndivine being, or being itself. For Aquinas and classical thinkers,\nbeing was already concretized in a single source that was supremely\nactual. It is this crucial assumption, Frankenberry has argued, that\nundergoes modification in the shift from a substance metaphysics to\none in which processive-relational categories are taken as ultimate\n(1993). The result is radical. De-substantialized and freed from\nstatic fixity in neo-scholastic metaphysics, being signifies the\nsource and power of all that exists. Dynamized and pluralized\naccording to the process paradigm, being does not repose in an\noriginary source antecedent to every event; rather, it constitutes the\nvery act of be-ing, of liv-ing, of ex-isting in the present moment as\na new one emergent from an antecedent many. As such, being or\ncreativity is inherently relational and processive. It is immanent\nwithin each momentary event as its spontaneous power; and it is also\ntranscendent to that event of becoming in the sense that it is never\nexhausted by the forms in which it is found, but is always potentially\na \u201cmore\u201d that is \u201cnot yet\u201d actualized. As long\nas being, like creativity, is not construed as something a being\nhas but rather as what it means to be at all, the\nlong identification of God with being in Western thought can be\nunderstood to point to sheer livingness or that which energizes all\nthings to exist. Although no-thing particular in its own right, being\nis the very actuality of things, their act of being there at all.\nNevertheless, Being-itself should not be construed as a particular\nbeing, thus ruling out pictorial theism\u2019s anthropomorphism. Neither is\nit the sum of all beings, thus ruling out simple aggregation or\ntotality. It is not a property of things nor an accidental quality,\nnot a substance, and not a class of things. Instead, the religious\nsymbol \u201cGod\u201d can be understood to pertain to the creative\nground of all that is\u2014that which energizes all\nthings\u2014conceived as dynamic, immanent, and plural.\n\nThe philosophical concepts of creativity (as explicated by Whitehead)\nand of esse (as explicated dynamically) are useful for any\nfeminist philosophy of religion that seeks to interpret the meaning of\n\u201cdivine reality\u201d, \u201choly mystery\u201d,\n\u201cempowering spirit\u201d, and a variety of other metaphors and\nsymbols that abound in feminist theology. The concept of God as\nesse refers to the utter actuality of things, an act common\nto all things. Dynamic and living, be-ing is yet elusive. It signifies\nthe moment to moment reality in virtue of which everything exists, a\nprocess that Whitehead\u2019s category of creativity describes as the many\nbecoming one, and as increased by one. Be-ing is no more real or\nunitary than beings, just as creativity in process philosophy is only\nactual in virtue of its accidents. As a model for feminist work, this\nnotion of transcendence is dialectically related to immanence, neither\ndissolved into it as identical, nor divorced from it as wholly\nother.\n4.2 Projecting a Feminine Divine\n\nA distinct alternative to the above appears in the feminist\nphilosophies of religion of Luce Irigaray and Mary Daly. Both seek to\nproject a \u201cfemale divine\u201d that would be fully immanental\nin and for the female Self (capitalized by Daly) and would provide\nwhat Irigaray calls a \u201csensible transcendental\u201d. The\ndifferent rhetorical strategies and cultural contexts of these two\ngynocentric philosophers sometimes conceal the similarity of their\nphilosophies of religion. Both argue that the Father God is an\nidealized projection of masculine identity and that the process of\nwomen\u2019s becoming divine is imperative. For Daly, the \u201cdivine\nspark\u201d within the female Self is the ontological ballast needed\nby the feminist movement; similarly for Irigaray, the creation of a\n\u201cfemale divine\u201d is a condition of female subjectivity.\nBoth Daly and Irigaray urge nothing less than an overturning of the\nsymbolic order and of language itself. Both are first and foremost\nphilosophers of the passions, seeking to encompass the elements of\nearth, air, fire, and water within their visions. Each in her own way\nhas helped to forge a radical feminist consensus that spirituality is\nto be exalted above doctrine, and that patriarchal conceptions of God\nas any kind of objective reality must be deconstructed so that female\nsubjectivity might become more expansive and free. Both reject\nreformist moves in the philosophy of religion as remaining inscribed\nwithin a phallocentric economy that evokes a god whose self-giving\nlove is only accessible through fathers and sons and their\nrepresentatives. In theorizing religion, both adopt a projection\ntheory, classically rooted in Feuerbach\u2019s claim that \u201ctheology\nis anthropology\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d a projection made in the\nimage of \u201cman\u201d. However, far from relegating religion to\nthe category of illusion, each issues an invitation to \u201cmake\nbelieve\u201d.\n4.2.1 In the American Context\n\nThe early Daly carved out a philosophy of religion largely consonant\nwith the position cited in 4.1 above, as found in her Beyond God\nthe Father: Towards a Philosophy of Women\u2019s Liberation (1973\n[1985]). Ultimate reality is conceptualized not only as Verb,\nexpressed in the present participle \u201cBe-ing\u201d, but as an\n\u201cintransitive Verb\u201d in which all being participates (Daly\n1973 [1985]: 34; 1978: 23; 1984: 423). In these terms, Daly provides an\nontological analysis of the urge toward transcendence, or\nparticipation in be-ing. Here the urge to transcendence is raised to\nthe cosmic scale, and the vision of peace, justice, and ecological\nharmony that Daly projects bears a close resemblance to prophetic\nbiblical texts. \u201cQuintessence\u201d expresses another metaphor\nfor the be-ing in which we live, love, create, are. Daly says that\nQuintessence \n\n\nis that which has been drawn on in my writing and searching. The quest\nfor Quintessence is the most Desperate response I know to the call of\nthe Wild. It means throwing one\u2019s life as far as it will go. (1998: 4)\n\n\n\nShe analyzes Quintessence as the highest essence, above the four\nelements of fire, air, water, and earth; it is what permeates all\nnature, the Spirit that gives life and vitality to the whole universe.\nAlthough it can be blocked or partly destroyed by violence and\npornography, poverty, racism, medical and scientific exploitation, and\nthe threat of ecological and nuclear destruction, its apparent\ninvincibility imparts an important measure of transcendence.\n\nThe later Daly\u2019s trilogy developed a modified, more immanent, theory\nof the divine, beginning with Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of\nRadical Feminism (1978), and continuing through Pure Lust:\nElemental Feminist Philosophy (1984) and most of\nQuintessence\u2014Realizing the Archaic Future (1998). Here\nthe dialectic shifts subtly from the earlier balance maintained\nbetween immanence and transcendence, and tips in favor of a divine\nthat is purely immanent within the female Self. Rather than being the\ndivine milieu within which the self lives, the divine is only alive\nwithin the self. In GynEcology the emphasis is on the power\n\u201cto spin\u201d meaning out of women\u2019s own divine orbs and to\nfind the power of being within one\u2019s self. By the time of Pure\nLust, Daly has further modified the \u201cpower of being\u201d\nto the pluralized \u201cPowers of Be-ing\u201d, a move that resolves\nthe problem of the one and the many in favor of the many. Given Daly\u2019s\nseparatist ideology, the \u201cdivine\u201d in question can only be\nwholly incarnate in the \u201cmany\u201d female divine Selves. The\ngynocentric emphasis of Daly\u2019s later writings will open her to the\nsame critical questions posed about Irigaray\u2019s woman-centered\nwritings. Can they do justice to differences that figure in\ndiscussions of race, class, ethnic origins, and so forth? Do they\nreinstall sexual difference with old stereotypes left intact, trapping\nwomen once more within the parameters of their sexuality and\nphysicality? Have they romanticized difference rather than theorizing\nit?\n\nDaly\u2019s intent was to create a trans-cultural, i.e., metapatriarchal,\nmyth, but her thinking was deeply indebted to one particular strain in\nthe Western intellectual tradition. Using the words of the Marxist\nErnst Bloch, one could call this strain \u201crevolutionary\nPrometheanism\u201d  (Block 1956\u20131959 [1986] passim). It\ngoes back at least as far as the Stoic logos spermatikos, the\n\u201cseed\u201d that links every person with the divine reason. It\nis closely connected with the medieval mystic\u2019s talk of a\n\u201cscintilla animae\u201d, the \u201cspark of the\nsoul\u201d, frequently echoed in Daly\u2019s books (e.g., 1978: 183:\n\u201cthe divine spark of be-ing in women\u201d). Meister Eckhart\ncould write: \n\n\nI have said that at times there is a power in the soul which alone is\nfree\u2026. It is free from all names, and altogether unimpeded,\nuntrammelled, and free from all modes, as God is free and untrammelled\nin Himself. (c. 1300 [1957: 137 as quoted in Pietsch 1979]) \n\n\nFor the radical medieval mystic like Eckhart the knowledge revealed in\nthe experience of this divine spark is utterly self-authenticating.\nTherefore, it need not be subjected to the judgment of an\ninstitutional church. So too Daly writes: \u201cshe knows that only\nshe can judge her self\u201d (1978: 378). Also important in this\nstrain of thought is the theme of the dispossession/repossession of\nthe true, divine self. It is a powerful theme in Hegel (who was\ninfluenced by medieval mysticism) and in Feuerbach, and it also\npervades Daly\u2019s philosophy of religion. Hegel decries human beings who\nlet themselves be \u201crobbed of freedom, their spirit, their\neternal and absolute element\u201d (1795 [1948: 162]) and who then\ntake \u201cflight to deity\u201d (1795 [1948: 163]). He insists that\nnow (ca. 1800) is the time for persons to \u201crepossess the\ntreasures formerly squandered on heaven\u201d (1795 [1948: 159]).\nFeuerbach takes up this same motif and makes it the dominant theme of\nhis whole critique of religion.  Daly refers to \u201cStolen female\nenergy\u201d (1978: 367), to \u201cour stolen original\ndivinity\u201d (1978: 41) and urges repossession. She does not say\nwhat this leaves for men, who have been living off women, the\n\u201cgenerators of energy\u201d (1978: 319).  Finally, along with\nFeuerbach, Daly says simply \u201cwe are divinity\u201d.\n\nDaly\u2019s philosophy of religion was plugged into the Promethean myth,\nbut she also added an original contribution. She explicitly expanded\nit to include women. Then she performed a reversal, and restricted it\nto women\u2014although this reversal, too, has deep roots in the\nWestern tradition, specifically, Iranian and biblical apocalypticism.\nDaly conveys the impression that only a few women are able to\nundertake the \u201cJourney\u201d (1978) or to achieve\n\u201cQuintessence\u201d (1998). This is not because she was\npessimistic about the female Self, which has \u201cimmeasurable\nunique potentialities\u201d (1978: 382), but because she was acutely\nsensitive to the power of evil, that is, to the power of the male\npatriarchy to successfully co-opt women. At the same time, Daly could\nbe rapturously optimistic about those women who do escape male power\nand begin to search and spin. These will find the \u201creal\nsource\u201d, the \u201cdeep Background\u201d, the \u201cpower of\nthe self\u2019s be-ing\u201d, \u201cthe Wild Self\u201d, and spin into a\n\u201cnew time/space\u201d, a \u201cnew creation\u201d, and will\nglimpse a \u201cParadise that is beyond the boundaries of patriarchal\nparadise\u201d (1978: 13, 24, 49, 283, 423).\n4.2.2 In the Continental Context\n\nMore than Daly, Luce Irigaray\u2019s writings have proved to be a\nprovocative stimulus for a number of feminist philosophers of religion\n(Anderson 1998; Deutscher 1994, 1997; Hollywood 1994, 1998; Jantzen 1999). Both a philosopher\nand a psychoanalyst, Irigaray aims to recuperate the repressed\nfeminine. Her chief themes are (1) the \u201csensible\ntranscendental\u201d, which performs a similar function as Derrida\u2019s\n\u201cfinite infinite\u201d, (2) sexual difference as paradigmatic\nof difference in itself, and (3) divinity and spirituality as\nsignificant feminist requirements to ground female subjectivity.\nIrigaray conceptualises the female divine as a \u201csensible\ntranscendental\u201d that is both flesh and word (Irigaray 1984\n[1993a: 115, 129]). Reversing traditional incarnational doctrine, she\nspeaks of flesh made word instead of word made flesh. \n\n\nBut if the Word was made flesh in this way, and to this extent, it can\nonly have been to make me (become) God in my jouissance, which can at\nlast be recognized. (1977 [1985: 199\u2013200])\n\n\nPerhaps the best way to read Irigaray\u2019s notion of the \u201csensible\ntranscendental\u201d is in terms of Mary Daly\u2019s description of her\nown project: \u201cThe philosophy here unfolded\u201d, Daly\nexplained, \u201cis material/physical as well as spiritual,\nmending/transcending this deceptive dichotomy\u201d (1984: 7).\nImagining both sexual difference and divine otherness, Irigaray coins\nthe sensible transcendental to overcome the split between\ntranscendence (mind or spirit) and sensibility (body). Unlike Daly,\nhowever, Irigaray argues that a spiritual relationship between women\nand men, understood as progressive energy transmission, can enable a\nharmonization of the human and divine dimensions separated under\npatriarchal distortions. A love that welcomes difference will be\ncapable of recognizing the other as transcendent to the self. Each\npartner will be allowed access to her or his own divinization.\n\nIn \u201cDivine Women\u201d (1993b [first published 1987]) and\n\u201cBelief Itself\u201d (1993b [first presented 1980]) Irigaray\u2019s\napproach to the topic of divinity is profoundly immanentalizing,\ncompared to traditional theology and philosophy of religion, even as\nher interest appears concentrated on the meaning of (women\u2019s)\ntranscendence. Her reconstruction requires two dialectical movements.\nFirst, she must nullify the radical alterity of the Wholly Other God,\narguing that this is a god produced by and for the masculine imaginary\nand therefore not suitable to women\u2019s becoming. Second, she must\nelevate \u201cwoman\u201d to the status of the divine, negating\nSimone de Beauvoir\u2019s view that woman remains always within the\ndimension of immanence, incapable of transcendence. Mediated by a\n\u201cgod of her sex\u201d, woman\u2019s becoming (divine) is thus\npossible, and in turn makes possible for the first time an ethics that\ndefines a genuine relationship between two subjects, male and female,\nwho do not simply differ, but differ differently. In the final\nanalysis, by \u201cthe divine\u201d Irigaray means \u201csexual\ndifference\u201d itself, that is, a new form of ethical relationship\nthat can exist between women and men, or, by extension, between women\nand any others, once women have attained their own subjectivity.\n\nShorn of his anthropocentrism, Irigaray\u2019s philosophy of religion\nrecalls the twofold ambition of Feuerbach\u2019s philosophy of religion in\n1841: to elevate \u201cman\u201d to the level of \u201cGod\u201d\nin order to display the true essence of the species-being; and to\ndissolve \u201cGod\u201d into the human essence more unequivocally\nthan Hegel, who did not fully anthropologize the divine. Her relation\nto Feuerbach (and Hegel) is apparent in her account of the sensible\ntranscendental as marking the fundamental materiality of spirit.\nDebates concerning Irigaray\u2019s possible \u201cessentialism\u201d and\n\u201cutopianism\u201d also recall Marx\u2019s critique of Feuerbach\u2019s\n\u201cspecies-being\u201d, and repeated charges of the utopian\nquality of Marx\u2019s own idea of unalienated humanity. Some feminists\nrebut the utopian charge by finding in Irigaray\u2019s reflections on the\nelement of air in the work of Heidegger a tangible example of\nmateriality that transcends the limitations of embodiment without\nbeing any less material (Armour 2003). Others read Irigaray\u2019s notion\nof a sensible transcendental as relying too heavily on western models\nof autonomy and self-determination (M. Keller 2003). Recently,\nIrigaray\u2019s explorations of the meaning of spirit/breath as the\nelemental force of life have put her in touch with eastern religious\ntraditions such as Hinduism (Irigaray 1999 [2002]).\n\nA major question some feminists have raised about the \u201cfeminine\ndivine\u201d is whether the language of transcendence can be retained\nplausibly as a poetic probe when the object of belief is assumed to be\nunreal. Amy Hollywood\u2019s analysis discloses why acceptance of a\nFeuerbachian projection theory of religion, in which God is the\nprojection of human wishes, attributes, and desires, complicates any\neffort to construct a new \u201cfeminine divine\u201d. Belief works,\nHollywood says, only as long as the underlying dynamics that fund it\nremain hidden. \n\n\nWhat Irigaray appears to forget is Feuerbach\u2019s central claim (and the\ngrounds for his hope that the hold of religion might be broken): for\nreligious projection to function, its mechanism must be hidden so that\nits object might inspire belief. (Hollywood 1994: 175) \n\n\nIrigaray recognizes that the \u201cexposure\u201d of this mechanism\nhas not destroyed religion for many, and hence asserts the importance\nof adequate projections. But how is such projection possible or\nmeaningful for those, like Irigaray herself, who assume that the\nobject of belief is unreal? If Irigaray maintains a Feuerbachian human\nreferent for her own projection of religious discourse in terms of\nfemale representations of the divine, the feminine divine, too, would\nseem to facilitate its own destruction. What possibilities does this\nleave for female transcendence? Can belief be simultaneously posited\nand deconstructed? Can the strong female subjectivity created\nin and by a mystic such as Teresa of Avila become available to women\nwithout Teresa\u2019s acceptance of a transcendent Other who is\nthe divine (Hollywood 1994: 176)? Because transcendence for Irigaray\nis associated with the \u201cmale\u201d and a sacrificial economy,\nit is not clear how women are expected to claim the new subjectivity\nthat she thinks religion, reconstituted, can offer. It may be the case\nthat Irigaray herself is ambivalent about belief and transcendence,\nand this leads her \u201cimmediately to deconstruct the very deities\nshe invokes\u201d (1994: 176). It may further be the case that the\ngynocentric project in philosophy of religion creates distinctive\ntensions, leading even sympathetic critics to inquire \n\n\nhow far the immanent can be re-inscribed as the site of transcendence\nwithout returning to the logic of sacrifice and bodily suffering\nseemingly endemic to the incarnational theologies of Christianity.\n(Hollywood 1994: 177) \n\n\nThere is also the related question as to \u201cwhether belief can be\nmimed without re-inscribing women into a logic of the same such as\nthat which Irigaray sees underlying Christianity\u201d (Hollywood\n1994: 177).\n\nIrigaray can be interpreted as striving to create a religious language\nthat leads neither to theism nor to atheism but rather to a dialectic\nof immanence and transcendence that does not in any way assume an\n\u201cobject of belief\u201d along hierarchical lines of verticality\n(see Hollywood 2002: chap. 7). In comparison to traditional\ntheological accounts of such a dialectic, however, the emphasis of\nIrigaray\u2019s philosophy of religion is oriented to affirming immanence,\nrather than to escaping finitude, embodiment, and materiality. The\ndivine is to be found in the space between two (human) beings who\nencounter each other face to face in the recognition of sexual\ndifference. Transcendence for women hinges on the possibility of this\nradical, and relational, immanentizing of the meaning of divinity.\n5. Immanental Themes and Methods\n\nWhile revisionist, de-patriarchalized philosophies of God/ess continue\nto engage some feminist philosophers of religion, others are willing\nto see even that topic cease to be center stage. As new waves of\nhistoricism and anti-essentialism register among the generation of\npost-analytic philosophers of religion, dissatisfaction has begun to\ndevelop with the traditional topics. Traditionally, for nonfeminist\nphilosophers, the tendency to assimilate questions about religion to\nquestions about \u201cbelief in the existence of God\u201d has led\ndown a slippery slope that transformed philosophical reflection about\nreligion into reflection on the existence of God, the rationality of\nbelief, the validity of the proofs, and the coherence of the divine\nattributes. This slide was historically understandable in terms of the\ninfluence of natural theology on philosophy of religion in the West,\nbut the real issue, as noted by Michael McGhee, \u201cis whether such\npreoccupations should remain central to the philosophy of religion,\nand, if not, what should replace them\u201d (1992: 1). This section\nsamples several emerging directions that signal the new preoccupations\nof feminist philosophers of religion.\n5.1 Feminist Standpoint Epistemology\n\nEpistemological questions constitute an important part of the agenda\nfor feminist philosophies of religion. What has the status of\nknowledge in various religious traditions? What gets valorized as\nworth knowing? What are the criteria evoked? Who has the authority to\nestablish religious meaning? Is religious meaning something distinct\nfrom or independent of ordinary linguistic meanings of words? Who is\nthe presumed subject of religious belief? How does the social position\nof the subject affect the content of religious belief? What is the\nimpact upon religious life of the subject\u2019s sexed body? What do we\nlearn by examining the relations between power, on the one hand, and\nwhat counts as evidence, foundations, modes of discourse, forms of\napprehension and transmission, on the other? In view of the intimate\nconnection of power/knowledge, how do we handle the inevitable\nocclusion that attends all knowledge production? What particular\nprocesses constitute the normative cultural subject as masculine in\nits philosophical and religious dimensions?\n\nThe work of feminist philosopher of religion Pamela Sue Anderson\noffers a good example of the feminist standpoint theory approach to\nreligion and gender, unadulterated by any loyalty to Christianity. In\nthe first book-length study to be entitled A Feminist Philosophy\nof Religion (1998) Anderson set out to revise and reform\nphilosophy of religion by using feminist standpoint epistemology as\ndeveloped by Sandra Harding in philosophy of science. A feminist\nstandpoint is not the same as a woman\u2019s experiences, situation, or\nperspective but is rather an achievement of an epistemically informed\nperspective resulting from struggle by or on behalf of women and men\nwho have been dominated, exploited, or oppressed. Applied to\nphilosophy of religion, feminist standpoint epistemology involves\nthinking from the perspective of women who have been oppressed by\nspecific monotheistic religious beliefs. Anderson challenges both the\nprivileged model of God as a disembodied person and the related model\nof reason as neutral, objective, and free of bias and desire. Spinning\nnew myths or devising new conceptions of a divine reality are not part\nof this agenda. There is only the double imperative: \u201cto think\nfrom the lives of others\u201d and \u201cto reinvent ourselves as\nother\u201d.\n\nHowever, adequate understanding of the religious beliefs of embodied\npersons, according to Anderson, requires a deeper analysis of the\nmultiple intertwinings between reason and desire than philosophy of\nreligion normally shows.\n\nBut how are feminists to talk about the material content of female\ndesire? At just this point feminist standpoint epistemology yields to\npoststructuralist insights and Anderson finds in the work of Irigaray,\nKristeva, and bell hooks themes that are missing in mainstream\nepistemology and some feminist epistemology. She articulates her\nphilosophy of religion around \u201cyearning\u201d as a cognitive\nact of a creative and just memory. As used by bell hooks (1990),\nyearning is a positive act that motivates struggle in the search for\npersonal and communal justice. It shapes a spirituality. According to\nAnderson, yearning is the vital reality of human life which gives rise\nto religious belief. Therefore, philosophical analysis of and feminist\nconcern with reason combined with desire, as found in expressions of\nyearning for truth whether epistemological, ethical (justice), or\naesthetic (love or beauty), need to supplement standard approaches to\nphilosophy of religion.\n\nOne must be careful, Anderson says, not to conflate yearning with only\na disguised form of the philosophical aspiration to be\ninfinite. Her analysis of the concept of the infinite reveals a\ncorrupt striving to become infinite or \u201call there is\u201d at\nwork in both masculinist and feminist philosophy of religion. In place\nof this Anderson calls for an approach that would allow instantiating\nthe regulative ideals of truth, love, goodness, and justice as\nconditions for any incorrupt craving for infinitude. Humans can yearn\nfor truth or crave infinitude while at the same time acknowledging\nself-consciously held and embodied locations (Anderson 2001). This\nmeans that, as other philosophers have pointed out, there is no\n\u201cGod\u2019s eye view\u201d, no actual infinite (Aquinas\u2019s\n\u201cactus purus\u201d); the notion of infinity pertains only to\nabstract potentiality, whereas concrete actuality is incurably\nfinite.\n\nQuestions of the justifiability of religious belief have previously\nbeen center stage in philosophy of religion. Anderson does not\nconsider this question per se, but instead analyzes the prior\nquestion of the rational construction of belief and the production of\nknowledge. She considers the ways in which an exclusive focus on\njustification of dominant beliefs excluded women\u2019s beliefs and women\u2019s\nrole in reasoning by assuming that only certain privileged beliefs\nshould be assessed for their truth. At the same time she argues\nagainst any swift dismissal of justificatory questions, as well as\nagainst a strict focus on the justification of theistic\nbeliefs. The myths of Mirabai, the legendary Hindu poetess-saint, and\nAntigone, the mythical figure of insurgence in Greek tragedy, are\nuseful in understanding the notion of yearning as a rational passion\nlinked to bodily experiences (1998: chap. 5). Anderson finds the\ndisruptive mimings of these myths helpful for challenging the narrow\nparameters of empirical realist forms of theism.\n5.2 Further Psychoanalytic Perspectives on the Female Symbolic\n\nGrace Jantzen issues a radical challenge to other feminist\nphilosophers who would make epistemology, rather than psychoanalytic\ntheory, their point of departure in studying religion and its\nrepressed underside. (Jantzen 1999, 2004). She argues that questions\nabout truth and the justification of religious belief can be dismissed\nas categories of the masculine symbolic. Going beyond Luce Irigaray,\nJantzen\u2019s body of work at the time of her death in 2006 proposed\nnothing less than a new imaginary of religion, a feminist symbolic of\n\u201cnatality and flourishing\u201d as an alternative to the\ncategory of mortality, verging on necrophilia/necrophobia, with which\nthe western tradition has been saturated. Influenced by Hannah\nArendt\u2019s work on natality and Adriana Cavarero\u2019s feminist reading of\nPlato, Jantzen believed that a preoccupation with death and violence\nsubtends the masculinist imaginary. If feminist philosophy of religion\nis ever to transform the symbolic order which inscribes this\nimaginary, it is necessary to change the imaginary. For this purpose,\na model of transformative change drawn from psychoanalysis and\nContinental philosophy of religion is more useful than a model drawn\nfrom Anglo-American adversarial modes of argumentation (Jantzen 1999:\n78).\n\nTo demonstrate the extent to which the Western symbolic is saturated\nwith violence and death, epitomized in the crucified Christ, Jantzen\nsituated her philosophy of religion in relation to the psychoanalytic\ntheory of both Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray. Their account offers\na theory of one of the most important features of any religion:\nsacrifice. Sacrificial codes involve a forgetting/erasure of the\ncomplex role of the maternal, amounting to a \u201cmatricide\u201d\n(Kristeva) at the foundation of religious practice. According to\nIrigaray in \u201cBelief Itself\u201d, the central figure of the\nwestern cultural imaginary is the unmourned and unacknowledged\nsacrifice of the (m)other\u2019s body that Christianity masks under the\nEucharistic sacrifice of the son. According to Kristeva (1977 [1987])\nin \u201cStabat Mater\u201d, the real symbolic association is not\nbetween women and birth, but between women and death, setting up men\nas cultural masters over and above mortality and its intimations in\nthe bodies of women.\n\nJantzen corrected the matricidal assertion of Kristevan theory; she\nargued against thinking that the child\u2019s need to separate from the\nmother in order to become an individual is what initiates a logic of\nsacrifice and violence in the western symbolic. There is no imperative\nto sacrifice the mother in order to commence formation of the self in\nthe cultural realm. However important separation and individuation are\nin subject formation, they are not proportional to death and violence.\nIf we were to attend to natality instead, Jantzen wrote, we would be\nbetter able to create a new imaginary based on birth, life, and\npotentiality (Jantzen 2003). Feminist philosophy of religion should\ntry to follow the path of desire to/for the divine, and forego the\npreoccupation with the rational justification of beliefs and the\nevaluation of truth-claims. Feminist philosophy of religion can attend\nbetter to the symbolic impact of birth rather than death as a strategy\nfor creating a new imaginary construct that emphasizes flourishing of\nlife rather than sacrifice of it. The norms of moral or political\nadequacy replace those of epistemic adequacy (Jantzen 2004).\n\nIf one asks what the ontological status of the divine is for Jantzen,\none could say that it is pantheistic (see Jantzen 1999, chap. 11). As\nthe horizon of human becoming, the divine is transcendent in the sense\nof the other of the world, non-reducible to statements about the\nworld\u2019s physical characteristics. As immanent, the divine is\nthis world; there is no other. What previously had been seen\nas a set of polarities now opens out into a play of diversities,\nbringing the divine to life through us.\n\nFoundations of Violence, Jantzen\u2019s final publication,\nsynthesizes her analysis of the psychoanalytic, religious, and\nphilosophical dimensions of death and violence in Western culture,\nculminating in a constructive alternative (a feminine symbolic) that\ncelebrates beauty, desire, and the creative impulse.\nThanatos, a death drive, far from being a universal of human\nnature, as Freud believed, is a gendered construction of Western\nmodernity, according to Jantzen, with precursors in Christendom and\nclassical antiquity. Homer, Sophocles, Plato and Aristotle provide the\ngenealogy of violence in Western thought that Jantzen critiques here,\nwhile Plotinus stands in for all those other-worldly seekers who\ngesture toward release in another world. What was to be a six-volumed\nstudy on Death and the Displacement of Beauty in the western\ntradition can be comprehended in incipient form in Jantzen 1999.\n\nPushing with and against Lacanian and Freudian theories, Jantzen\n(2002), Armour (2002), and Hollywood (2002, 2004) offer three\nimportant readings of Irigaray\u2019s essay \u201cBelief Itself\u201d\n(1980 [1993b]). These feminist readings rely on critical\nappropriations of psychoanalysis and Derridean reading practices to\nre-assess a topic that stands at the center of much modern philosophy\nof religion. Belief and its formation, they show, is implicated in the\nformation of the subject and sexual difference, as well as related\nissues of embodiment and presence and absence. The argument is not\nonly the familiar feminist one that the object of belief is\nmale-defined, but the more radical claim that the structure and\ndiscourse of belief itself is masculinist and in need of\ndeconstruction. That is to say that the constitution of the normative\n(Western, bourgeois) subject of religion and philosophy depends on the\nassociation of the body with the mother and femininity and an always\nincomplete and ambivalent mastering, concealment, or denial of the\nmother\u2019s body. Freud\u2019s own account of the fort/da game\n(\u201cgone\u201d-\u201cthere\u201d) played by his grandson,\nErnst, exposes the relationship between belief and the little boy\u2019s\nmastery of the mother\u2019s presence and absence, concealedness and\nunconcealedness. Despite her apparent absence, she is there, the boy\ncomes to believe, and in so believing he experiences his own power.\nFor Irigaray (1993b), God, as the Father and the source of meaning,\nemerges as the object of a belief first articulated in the (male\nchild\u2019s) attempt to master the mother\u2019s absence; the dismantling of\nthe subject as master, then, implies a concomitant deconstruction of\nthe object of belief. For Armour (2002), the implications of this\nreading on the other side of ontotheology entail a challenge to any\nnarrow definition of ontotheology or too-easy hope that it might swing\nfree of logocentrism and phallocentrism. The wound at the heart of\nnormative masculine subjectivity, evident in Derrida\u2019s display of his\ndying mother\u2019s body in his essay \u201cCircumfession\u201d, is an\neffect of the current sacrificial economy on the mother/son\nrelationship. As Armour suggests, \n\n\nworking from the recognition of a primordial maternal sacrifice\n(rather than belief in a transcendent Father God) requires\nconfrontation with pain and loss, not compensation for them. (Armour\n2002: 223) \n\n\nFor Hollywood, a further implication concerns the renewed attention to\nthe place of ritual and practice in religion. Not only do religious\nrituals, bodily practices, and discursive performatives construct\ngender but they also construct the very objects of religious belief.\nHer proposal that, as constituted, gender and the objects of religious\nbelief have a similar ontological status re-opens a crucial question\nthat many feminist philosophers of religion have finessed. The\nontological status of objects of belief, especially deliberately\nprojected ones, cannot be fully understood without bringing back into\nthe picture the body, emotion, and desire as shaped by ritual\npractices (Hollywood, 2004).\n5.3 Corporeal Subjectivity\n\nThe body, a recurrent theme in a variety of recent interdisciplinary\nstudies, figures as the material or symbolic basis for much feminist\nphilosophy of religion, in contrast to the fiction of disembodied\nsubjectivity that marks mainstream modern epistemology.\n\nOne such body-based study, Howard Eilberg-Schwartz\u2019s work, God\u2019s\nPhallus and Other Problems for Men and Monotheism (1994), is\nindicative of a new alliance of philosophy of religion with gender\nstudies and social theory, rather than with natural theology and\nspeculative metaphysics. Dozens of feminist studies have explored the\nway in which male deities authorize male domination and undermine\nfemale experience in the social order. Left unconsidered was the\nquestion whether a male divinity generates certain dilemmas and\ntensions for the conception of masculinity, rendering its meaning\nunstable. Pursuing this question, Eilberg-Schwartz overturns the\nconventional assumption that Jewish monotheism centered on an\ninvisible, disembodied deity. His analysis of numerous myths shows\nthat ancient Israel did image God in human form, while at the same\ntime veiling the divine phallus.\n\nTwo consequences in particular arise for masculinity in a religious\nsystem that imagines a male deity with a phallus. First, the dilemma\nof homoerotic desire is posed when men worship a male God in a culture\nbased on heterosexual complementarity. Although the expression of\ndivine-human intimacy is couched in the language of male-female\ncomplementarity, it is males, not females, who enter into the\ncovenantal marriage with the deity. Collectively, Israelite men were\nconstituted discursively as \u201cshe\u201d, and said to be\n\u201cwhoring\u201d when they strayed from monotheism (monogamy)\ninto idolatry (adultery). Suppression of the homoerotic impulse in the\ndivine-human relationship, however, could take several forms: hiding\nand veiling the body of God through prohibitions against depicting\nGod; feminizing Israelite males so that they could assume the role of\nGod\u2019s wife; and exaggerating the way in which women are\n\u201cother\u201d so as to minimize the ways in which men are made\ninto others of God.\n\nThe solution of imagining Israel as a metaphorical woman, in an\nexclusive relation to the divine maleness, may have solved the first\ndilemma of homoerotic desire only by generating another. The second\nmajor dilemma for masculinity, according to Eilberg-Schwartz, is posed\nby being made in the image of a sexless Father God in a culture\ndefined by patrilineal descent. The sexlessness of a Creator Father\nGod sets up major tensions for men who must pro-create. In contrast to\nthe Christian religion, whose different logic of a God fathering a Son\ncould render a human father irrelevant, Hebrew logic placed great\nimportance on the human father, generating tension around a Father God\nwho was thought to be sexless and therefore without a son. When the\ndilemma of homoerotic desire is posed later for Christian men in\nrelation to a male Christ\u2019s body, it, too, is avoided by speaking\ncollectively of the Christian community as a woman.\n\nFeminist philosophy of religion has yet to explore fully the question\nof how a male God is problematic for men\u2019s conceptions of self,\naccording to Eilberg-Schwartz. It has also left unthought the\ndifference between God as male and God as Father. Strict focus on the\nways in which a masculine image of God undermines female experience\ntends to conflate human and divine masculinities into one\nundifferentiated symbol. Eilberg-Schwartz differentiates between\nimages of male deities and images of father deities, contending that\nthe maleness of God may have different implications than the\nfatherliness of God. Fatherly images of God can and should be used, he\nargues, \u201cbut only if equally powerful female images are also\ncelebrated\u201d (1994: 239). Repudiating the incorporeal, distant\nGod that helped to generate the hierarchical associations of\nmasculinity and femininity, he favors an image of \u201ca tender\nloving Father who faces and embraces the child\u201d, in the apparent\nexpectation that a loving and embodied God may support a different\nkind of masculinity, one more capable of intimacy and tenderness\n(1994: 240).\n5.4 The Webbed Relations of Language, Experience, Power, and Discourse\n\nPoststructuralist criticism as it studies the webbed relations of\nlanguage, experience, power, and discourse still leaves some open and\nuntheorized space in the links among these terms. Mary McClintock\nFulkerson\u2019s Changing the Subject: Women\u2019s Discourses and Feminist\nTheology (1994), fills those gaps and challenges three inadequate\nnotions of language, gender, and power: (1) the idea that linguistic\nsigns re-present the thing; (2) the Cartesian assumption of the\nsubjective consciousness as the origin of meaning; and (3) the\nunderstanding of power only in terms of external, unidirectional, and\nnegative oppression. Poststructuralist method also critiques the\nliberal logic of inclusion that appeals to \u201cwomen\u2019s\nexperience\u201d or \u201cwomen\u2019s religious experience\u201d as\nthough it is an unproblematic or uncoded content of some kind. All\nsuch strategies and methods, Fulkerson shows, fail to recognize and\naccount for the multiplicity of differences among myriad subject\npositions. In contrast to the liberal humanist goal of accommodating\nas many \u201cdifferent voices\u201d as possible, discourse analysis\nseeks a more radical reading of the ways \u201cvoice\u201d itself is\nproduced and knowledge is power. Taking into account the inextricable\nand multiplicative character of the link between knowledge and the\nsocial relations out of which knowledge emerges changes the question,\nas well as the subject, according to Fulkerson. The question is not,\nfor example, whether a given religious belief system is oppressive or\nliberating to women. Such generic and wholesale frames need to be\nreplaced by more complex appreciation of the construction of multiple\nidentities according to different locations in the social formation of\npatriarchal capitalism.\n\nFleshing out the multiple orderings that create differences in women\u2019s\npositions should result in a clarification of what is at stake in\nappeals to \u201cwomen\u2019s experience\u201d, often taken as a\n\u201csource\u201d and/or \u201cnorm\u201d for feminist thought in\nan earlier generation of texts. Rather than as a \u201ccontent\u201d\nthat is representative of a natural realm of women\u2019s consciousness,\nreligious or otherwise, \u201cwomen\u2019s experience\u201d should be\nunderstood as constructed from \u201cconverging discourses, their\nconstitution by differential networks, and their production of certain\npleasures and subjugations\u201d (Fulkerson, 115) Experience is not\nthe origin of (feminist) philosophy of religion in the sense of\noffering evidence for its claims, but the very reality that needs to\nbe explained. Similarly, in theorizing the link, for example, between\nthe maleness of divine imagery and the legitimation of male dominance,\nwhat needs to be explained is how the maleness of divine imagery gets\ndistributed and interrelated with material realities, and how the\ndiscourse itself carries out the oppression of women.\n\nOnce the false universal of \u201cwomen\u2019s experience\u201d or\n\u201chuman experience\u201d is replaced with an \u201canalytic of\nwomen\u2019s discourses\u201d, feminist philosophers of religion can begin\nto consider the specific productions of positions for women, asking\nsuch questions as: \n\n\nWhat discourses construct the middle-class white churchwoman\u2019s\npositions? The poor Pentecostal woman preacher\u2019s? The liberal academic\nliberation feminist\u2019s? \n\n\nIn her investigations of Appalachian Pentecostal women preachers\u2019\ndiscourse and of the discourse of Presbyterian women\u2019s groups,\nFulkerson sees two very diverse women\u2019s subject positions wrestling\nwith a religious tradition in ways both liberating and constraining.\nApproaching the world of faith as a system of discourses, rather than\nas representational interpretations or cognitive belief claims, she\ndisplays how women\u2019s faith positions can be constitutive of their\nemancipatory practices. The call stories and worship performances of\npoor Pentecostal women ministers, accompanied by ecstatic and bodily\ndisplays of joy, produce particular forms of resistance to patriarchal\nconstraints, just as the faith practices of middle class Presbyterian\nhousewives produce other possibilities for transgression, pleasure,\nand desire.\n\nOne merit of this methodology for feminist philosophy of religion is\nits exposure of the complexity of gender discourse, the constraints\nand resistances found in faith practices, and the social conditions of\nsignification. It creates space in which it is possible to ask what\nphilosophy of religion has occluded from its angle of vision by virtue\nof the abstract and distanced discourse that has characterized it.\n\nOne drawback of poststructuralist accounts of discourse, according to\nsome feminists, is that it rules out the possibility that claims can\nbe validated outside of particular communities and their languages.\nFulkerson appeals to nonfoundationalism, the position that eschews the\nsearch for justifying beliefs or experiences that can in turn support\nother beliefs derived from them. She says that she does not find it\nnecessary to offer reasoned arguments for the faith claims she\ninvokes. The pertinent discursive practices she analyzes are those of\nresistance, survival, agape, and hope\u2014practices, she freely\nadmits, that assume the existence of God rather than problematize it.\nWhat remains an open question for this avenue of feminist philosophy\nof religion is how far discourse analysis can go toward ever\nsubverting the belief structures of Pentecostal women ministers or\nPresbyterian housewives, indeed, how it could even be theoretically\npossible for it to do so.\n5.5 Pragmatizing Feminist Philosophy of Religion\n\nIn the North American context, a convergence of feminist and\npragmatist agendas has emerged, with important implications for\nfeminist philosophy of religion. Indebted to the pioneering work of\nCharlene Haddock Seigfried (1996), and recent studies by McKenna\n(2001) and Sullivan (2001), pragmatist-feminist philosophy of religion\nis distinguished by several features. First, on its philosophical\nside, both pragmatist philosophy and feminism share a strong critique\nof scientistic positivism; resistance to fact-value dichotomies;\nreclamation of the experiential and epistemic import of aesthetics;\nanalyses of dominant discourses in light of forms of social\ndomination; linkage of theory and practice; interest in the\ntheoretical primacy of concrete experience; repudiation of the\nspectator stance of philosophical indifference; and an interrogation\nof the social-political effects of the social sciences. Second, on its\nreligious side, the pragmatist tradition offers untapped resources for\nfeminist reconstruction, ranging from the explicit philosophies of\nreligion in the classical writings of Peirce, James, Dewey, Santayana,\nand Mead, to the implicit ones in the current revival of pragmatism on\nboth sides of the Atlantic. The religious import of American\npragmatism in its first millennium is best understood as a\nnaturalization of traditional notions of transcendence and\nspirituality rather than, as its critics charge, an abdication of any\nhopes of transcendence at all. According to one interpreter (Stuhr\n2003), pragmatism has relocated traditional notions of transcendence\nwithin immanence, relocated spirit within nature, relocated absolutes\nwithin inquiry, relocated affirmation within negation, and relocated\nsalvation within community, a description that applies equally to the\nrelocation effort performed in feminist philosophies of religion. The\nend result of these combined naturalization processes should yield\nsomething new to philosophy of religion: \n\n\ntruth without the problems of certainty; justification without the\nproblems of foundations; nature and access to it without the problems\nof supernaturalism or solipsism; values without the problems of\nabsolutism or arbitrariness; and distinctively religious or spiritual\nexperience without idealism, dualism, or institutional religion.\n(Stuhr 2003: 194)\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nFeminist scholarship in general has had a hard time with religion. And\nmainstream philosophy of religion until recently has had a hard time\nwith feminist scholarship.\n\nGoing forward in the twenty-first century, three particular questions\nstand out. The most significant question on the agenda for future\nreflection concerns religious pluralism and the need to overcome the\nextreme ethnocentrism of Anglo-American philosophy of religion.\nInsofar as the field faces the challenge of encounter with traditions\nexpressing practices and beliefs that are not predominantly associated\nwith European, white, or male modes of understanding, it will be\nrequired to elaborate new models of interpretation, a broader theory\nof evidence, a cross-culturally adequate conception of human\nrationality, and a more complex appraisal of the norms applicable to\ncases of divergent, rival religious claims and disagreements. Insofar\nas feminist philosophy of religion studies the strictly intellectual\ninterpretations of any religious tradition, it will encounter beliefs,\nsymbols, and ideas that are embedded in specific socio-cultural power\nrelations. New work is now needed that reflects on the dynamics of\npower relations, analyzes inherited oppressions, searches for\nalternative wisdom and suppressed symbolism, and risks new accounts of\nthe tricky truth and justification questions in light of religious\npluralism.\n\nTaking seriously the striking plurality of human forms of religious\nlife leads to a second significant question. What theorizations of\nreligion are most adequate for feminists to work with? Before this\nquestion can be addressed with all the philosophical rigor its\ncomplexity demands, feminists must face up to the fact that religion\nis a potent dimension of the lives and desires of contemporary women\naround the world; therefore, philosophizing it away as superstition,\nreactionary ideology, false consciousness, irrational belief, or\npremodern, outmoded hangover simply calls into question, not the\nphenomenon of religion, but the grasp of feminist philosophy itself on\nits subject matter. In our time, the elementary forms of religious\nlife cannot be critiqued along the same old lines that Western secular\nmodernity has taken for granted. In the past, Marxians and Freudians\ncould provide theoretical fuel for the critique of religion for\ngenerations of readers, but their general theory of religion as a\nfunction of projection (of class interests or of the father-image) is\nseverely outdated. Since we cannot divide reality into what is\n\u201creally there\u201d and what is \u201chumanly\nprojected\u201d, and since there is no clear distinction to be drawn\nbetween the properties things have \u201cin themselves\u201d and the\nproperties that are \u201cin us\u201d, projection theories of\nreligion (or of anything else) rest on a purely suppositional basis.\nThey lack explanatory value.\n\nFinally, theorization of the meaning of \u201creligion\u201d in\nfeminist philosophy of religion in a pluralistic age leads to a third\narea of unploughed feminist ground. In addition to thinking about the\nphilosophy in religion, feminists need to think more deeply about the\nreligion in philosophy. What is the significance to feminists of the\n\u201creturn to religion\u201d found, for example, in Emmanuel\nLevinas or Gianni Vattimo? Theological conceptions abound also in the\nwork of Martin Heidegger, Iris Murdoch, Stanley Cavell, Charles\nTaylor, and Martha Nussbaum. The deconstructionist writings of Jacques\nDerrida offer another instance of secular writing in a religious key\nwhose feminist relevance needs to be assessed. Although some\noutstanding and suggestive work has been done by Fergus Kerr (1997),\nJohn Caputo (1997), and Hent de Vries (1999) on the religion in recent\nphilosophy, the feminist corner of the triangle\nreligion-philosophy-feminism remains to be more completely\nconfigured.\n",
