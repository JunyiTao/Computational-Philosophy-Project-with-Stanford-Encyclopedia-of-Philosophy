    "main_text": "The Marburg School || Conception of Philosophy: The Transcendental Method\n2.1 Conception of Philosophy: The Transcendental Method \n\nThe core commitment of the Marburg school was to a philosophical\nmethod: \u201cthe transcendental method\u201d (Natorp 1912a; Cohen\n1883: \u00a77\u20139; Cohen 1885: \u00a712; Richardson 2006). The\nmethod, as Natorp describes it, comes in two steps. In the first step,\nthe philosopher identifies some \u201cfact\u201d of culture.\nTheoretical philosophy begins with the \u201cfact of science\u201d;\npractical philosophy with the fact of \u201csocial order\u201d;\naesthetics with the fact of \u201cartistic creation\u201d. These\nfacts are concrete, detailed, and \u201chistorically\nverifiable\u201d. For instance, a theoretical philosopher begins by\ninvestigating the best scientific theories of her contemporaries. In\nthis first step, the philosopher is like a fact collector,\ninvestigating the methods, important concepts and laws of that aspect\nof culture, including the historical development of that area of\nculture up to the present day. In the second step, however, the\nphilosopher goes beyond fact-collecting to identifying those aspects\nof that area of culture that make its objective validity possible. As\nthey put it, this involves identifying the \u201claws\u201d or\n\u201cform\u201d of that area of culture. Their model here is Kant\nin the Prolegomena. As they read Kant, he began by\nidentifying within the best scientific theory of his\ntime\u2014Newton\u2019s\u2014the fundamental laws, concepts, and\nmethods (which are contained in Kant\u2019s Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science). The second step is showing how\nthese laws, concepts, and methods are made possible by even more\nfundamental concepts and laws, which are contained in the\nCritique itself\u2014laws which make objective validity\npossible.\n\nThere are a few aspects of this method that need to be emphasized.\nFirst, the second step in the method involves much more than just\nidentifying a class of basic laws and concepts. If a philosopher were\nto axiomatize a physical theory, even a fundamental one, for the\nMarburgers that would be only the first step. A philosopher also needs\na story of how just these laws and just these concepts make it\npossible for the theory to make true claims about objects\u2014a\nstory that will require a very general account of objective validity\nitself. Second, the transcendental method requires demonstrating the\nunity of culture. A philosophy of arithmetic should show how the laws\nof arithmetic fit in with the laws of geometry and analysis to form\nthe unity of mathematics; how the laws of mathematics are\npreconditions of all natural science to form the unity of science; and\nall the way up to the unity of culture. Third, these two steps are\ninterrelated. The notion of objective validity itself is analyzed in\nstep two on the basis of reflection on the details of concrete culture\nfrom step one; the philosopher in step one collects the relevant facts\nabout an area of culture because she has in mind the step two goal of\nexplaining its objective validity, in a unified account of the\nvalidity of all culture. Fourth, the method is non-skeptical,\nnon-revisionary, and unconcerned with certainty. Since it takes an\narea of culture as a fact, it rules out radical skepticism about the\nvalidity of an area of culture, and it has no room to advocate a\nradical revision in that area of culture. Though the goal of the\ntranscendental method is to provide foundations for culture, these\nfoundations are not meant to be certain. Transcendental logic, one\nmight say, is a semantic, not a Cartesian project. Fifth, though the\ntranscendental method is rooted in the concrete facts of contemporary\nculture, it is nevertheless possible and even necessary for a\nphilosopher to take sides on contested questions within culture. A\nphilosopher is not a bystander in culture. So, for instance, Cohen\nargues for infinitesimal over limit methods in the calculus, for\nHerz\u2019s mechanics over its rivals, for liberal democracy over\nmonarchy. After all, the transcendental philosopher, having studied\nthe method of an area of culture and its long historical development,\ncan show that one party in a dispute has departed in some fundamental\nway from that method. And the philosopher also has her eye on the\nquestion of the foundations of the objective validity of an area of\nculture (and its integration into a synthetic account of the objective\nvalidity of all culture), and so can intervene to show that one\napproach in a controversy is better suited to make objective validity\npossible.\n\nSince the transcendental method begins with the fact of culture,\nMarburg Neo-Kantians reject the possibility of speculative\nmetaphysics. Transcendental philosophy as they understand it is also\ndistinct from and independent of psychology. Though the goal of the\ntheory of knowledge is to understand what makes\n\u201cexperience\u201d possible, they understand experience in a\nradically non-psychological way. As Cohen puts in (1898: x, my\ntranslation):\n\n\nThe transcendental method does not research the principles of human\nreason but rather the foundation of science that conditions scientific\nvalidity. Our organization is, insofar as it comes into question in\ngeneral, a question of psychology; and there is at least no\nmethodological means for procuring secure, scientific, and exact\ninformation from the ultimate and simplest parts of our mental\nessence. But the sciences lie before us in books. What makes them into\nsciences, wherein their character of generality and necessity rests,\nfrom which concepts their epistemological validity within their region\ncan be derived, what tools and ways of knowing explain in its validity\nthose historical facts of knowledge\u2014the sciences\u2014this is a\nmethodological question, this is the question, which the sciences\nthemselves pose, whenever they feel the impulse to think about their\nown principles\u2014this and nothing else is the transcendental\nquestion.\n\n\nThe fact of science does not occur in the minds of individual\nscientists; it lies before us in books. \u201cExperience\u201d is\nnot a representation in the mind of a knower; it is the objective\ncontent. \u201cExperience\u201d is virtually equated with\nmathematical natural science, and a paradigm \u201cexperience\u201d\nis Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation. What makes experience\n(in this non-psychological sense) possible is \u201ca priori\u201d,\nnow interpreted in a radically non-psychological sense as elements of\nthe content of some aspect of culture that makes the objective\nvalidity of that culture possible. This new conception of the a\npriori, radically distinct from innateness and independent of any\nfacts about human minds discoverable by empirical psychology, is\narticulated in Cohen\u2019s Kant\u2019s Theory of\nExperience. It is here that Cohen\u2019s Neo-Kantianism breaks\ndecisively with the Kantianism of Lange and Helmholtz. In his book,\nCohen distinguishes between the \u201cmetaphysical a priori\u201d\nand the \u201ctranscendental a priori\u201d (1885: 109; cf. 1902:\n44). The metaphysical a priori are the basic structures of our\nthinking that we can discover by introspection or empirical study;\nthese are irrelevant to the transcendental philosopher (unless she is\ndoing philosophy of psychology). The transcendental a priori, on the\nother hand, are those aspects of the content of science that make\nobjective validity possible. Thus, the relationship between the a\npriori and experience is not like the relationship between a mental\napparatus and its acts. It is a logical relationship, more like the\nrelation between an axiom and a theorem (Cassirer 1918: 151,\n153)\u2014though with the important qualification that the a priori\nlaws are not just axioms, but axioms that have the special semantic\nfunction of making objective validity possible.\n\nThe fact of culture is not static, but dynamic. As Natorp memorably\nput it (1912a: 184; 1910: Ch.1, \u00a74; 1903: 366ff), the fact is not\na \u201cfactum\u201d (a thing done) but\n\u201cfieri\u201d (becoming). Culture changes; one\nscientific theory replaces another. In keeping with the transcendental\nmethod, only a Newtonian could have written what Kant wrote; but the\ntranscendental method just as emphatically requires that later\ntranscendental philosophers rethink the doctrines of the first\nCritique in light of the advances in mathematics and natural\nscience since Newton. This appreciation for the historically evolving\ncharacter of culture has two consequences. First, the transcendental a\npriori is not absolute, but relative to the current best physical\ntheories. Second, Marburg Neo-Kantians have an additional\ntranscendental task that Kant himself did not fully recognize: to\nunderstand how it is possible that the changes in an area of\nculture can themselves be objectively valid. They want to understand\nthe objective law or method that determines how an area of culture\n changes.[11]\n This emphasis on the objectivity and lawlikeness of cultural change thus\nintroduces a check on the potential relativistic or historicist\nconsequences of their relativizing the a priori. (Cassirer in\nparticular develops a sophisticated theory of the a priori with both\nrelative and absolute elements; see\n section 2.3.)\n This emphasis on the progressive character of culture leads the\nMarburg Neo-Kantians to adopt a distinctive, historical method of\nwriting and arguing, in which systematic philosophy is not separated\nfrom the history of philosophy and the history of\n culture.[12]\n",
