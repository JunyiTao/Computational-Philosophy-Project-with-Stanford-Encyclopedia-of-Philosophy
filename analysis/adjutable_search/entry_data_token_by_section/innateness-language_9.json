    "main_text": "Other Research Bearing on the Innateness of Language: New Problems for the Nativist? || Pidgins and Creoles\n3.5 Pidgins and Creoles\n\n\nIt has been argued (by, e.g., Bickerton  1981, and Pinker, \n1994:32-9) that the process by which a pidgin turns into a creole \nprovides direct evidence of the operation of an innate language \nfaculty. Pidgins are rudimentary communication systems that are \ndeveloped when people speaking different languages come together \n(often in a commercial setting or when one people has conquered and \nis exploiting another) and need to communicate about practical \nmatters. Creoles arise when pidgins are elaborated both syntactically\nand semantically, and take on the characteristics of bona \nfide natural languages.\n\n\nBickerton and, following him, Pinker, argue that creolization occurs \nwhen children take a pidgin as the input to their first language \nlearning, and urge that the added complexity of the creole reflects \nthe operation of the child's inborn language faculty. Moreover, they \nargue, since creole languages all tend to be elaborated in the same \nways, and since they all respect the constraints of UG, the \nphenomenon of creolization also supports the idea that the inborn \ncontribution to language acquisition is not just some general drive \nfor an effective system of communication, but rather knowledge of \nlinguistic universals.\n\n\nThere are two problems with this \u2018language bioprogram \nhypothesis,\u2019 as it is known in the creolization literature. The\nfirst concerns the claim (e.g., Bickerton 1981:43-70) that even \ncreoles that developed in quite different areas of the world, and in \ncomplete isolation from one another, bear \u201cuncanny \nresemblances\u201d (Pinker 1994:25) to each other, not just in \nrespecting the constraints of UG, but \u2014 even more surprisingly \n\u2014 in using fundamentally the same means to elaborate their root\npidgins (e.g., in using the same syntactic devices to mark tense, \naspect and modality). The stronger claim made by Bickerton \u2014 \nthat Creoles use the same devices for the same grammatical purposes \n\u2014 is simply not true. For example, as Myhill (1991) argues, \nJamaican Creole, Louisiana Creole, Mauritian Creole and Guyanese \nCreole mark tense, aspect and modality in ways that are quite \ndifferent from those that Bickerton (1981) proposed as universal. \n(See, however, Mufwene 1999 for a case that confirms Bickerton's \npredictions.) The weaker claim \u2014 that creoles respect the \nconstraints imposed by UG \u2014 has not, so far as I know, been \ncontested. So we will assume, in what follows, that creoles, like \nother NLs, respect UG. The important question for our purposes is: \nhow does this come about?\n\n\nThe bioprogram hypothesis claims that creolization occurs as a result\nof the action of the language faculty: children who learn language \nfrom degraded (e.g., pidgin) inputs are compelled by their innate \nknowledge of grammar to produce a fully-fledged natural language (the\ncreole) as output. As an example of how children add UG-constrained \nstructure to languages learned from degraded inputs, Pinker cites the\ncase of Simon, a deaf child studied by Newport and her colleagues, \nwho learned American Sign Language (ASL) from parents who themselves \nwere not exposed to ASL until their late teens. Although they used \nASL as their primary language, Simon's parents were \u201cin many \nways\u2026like pidgin speakers,\u201d says Pinker (1994:38). For \ninstance, they used inflectional markers in an inconsistent way and \noften failed to respect the structure-dependence of the rules \ngoverning topicalization in that \n language.[27]\n But \u201castoundingly,\u201d says Pinker, \u201cthough Simon saw \nno ASL but his parents' defective version, his own signing was far \nbetter ASL then theirs\u2026Simon must somehow have shut out his \nparents' ungrammatical \u2018noise.\u2019 He must have latched on \nto the inflections that his parents used inconsistently, and \ninterpreted them as mandatory.\u201d (1994:39) Pinker views this as \na case of \u201ccreolization by a single living child\u201d \n(ibid.) and explains Simon's conformity to ASL grammar in \nterms of the operation of his innate language faculty during the \nacquisition period.\n\n\nIn a recent overview of the Simon data from the last 10 or so years, \nhowever, Newport 2001, stresses a number of facts that Pinker's \npresentation obscures or downplays. First, Simon's performance was \nnot that of a native signer, although he did develop \u201chis own \nversion of ASL whose structure was more like that of other natural \nlanguages [than that of his parents' ASL]\u201d (Newport 2001:168).\nFor instance, Simon's morphology stabilized at a level that was \n\u201cnot as complex as native ASL\u201d and he didn't acquire \nstandard classifier morphemes if they were not used by his parents \n(ibid.). Secondly, Simon's success in learning a given rule \nseemed to vary with how well or badly his parents signed. For \ninstance, Simon's parents used the correct inflectional morphology \n60-75% of the time for a large class of verbs of motion, and in this \ncase, Simon's own use of such morphology was 90% correct. However, \nsome members of the class of classifier morphemes were correctly used\nby the parents only 40% of the time, and in this case, although \nSimon's performance was better than his parents', it was not at \nnative signer level.\n\n\nNewport argues that Simon appears to be \u2018cleaning up\u2019 his\nparents' language, that is, \u201cbas[ing] his learning heavily on \nhis input, but reorganiz[ing] this input to form a cleaner, more \nrule-governed system than the one to which he was exposed.\u201d \n(2001:168) She agrees that this result could be due to constraints \nimposed by an innate language faculty, but argues that it is also \nconsistent with the existence of some more generalized propensity in \nchildren to generate systematic rules from noisy inputs, rightly \npointing out that the latter hypothesis cannot be ruled out in \nadvance of empirical test. (In this context, she notes (p.170) some \npreliminary studies suggesting that inferring systematic rules from \nmessy data may indeed be a more general feature of learning in young \nchildren (though, interestingly, not in adults), for they can be seen\nto exhibit this tendency in non-linguistic pattern-learning contexts \ntoo.) Newport concludes that \u201cthe contrasts between Simon and \nhis parents are in certain ways less extreme, and more \nreorganizational, than might be suggested by the Language Bioprogram \nHypothesis\u2026[H]e does not appear to be creating an entirely new\nlanguage from his own innate specifications; rather, he appears to be\nfollowing the predominant tendencies of his input, but he sharpens \nthem, extends them, and forces them to be internally \nconsistent.\u201d (2001:173).\n\n\nIf Newport et al. are right, the case of Simon does not seem to give \nmuch support to the nativist hypothesis. Moreover, the argument from \ncreolization suffers a number of additional flaws. First, the \nBickerton-Pinker view, which assigns a dominant role to child \nlanguage learners in the creation of creoles, is but one of three \ncompeting hypotheses currently being explored in the creolization \nliterature. According to the \u2018superstratist\u2019 hypothesis, \ncreolization occurs not when children acquire language from pidgins, \nbut when successive waves of adult speakers try to learn the language\nof the dominant culture as a second language. (Chaudenson 1992, for \ninstance, defends this view about the origins of French creoles.) On \nthis view, the additional devices seen in creoles are corruptions of \ndevices seen in the dominant language. According to the \n\u2018substratist\u2019 hypothesis, creoles are again created by \nsecond language learners, rather than children, only the source of \nadded structure is the first language of the learner. (Lumsden 1999 \nargues that numerous traces of a variety of African languages in \nHaitian creole support this hypothesis.) One need not take a stand on\nwhich of these views is correct in order to see that these competing \nexplanations of creolization undermine Bickerton and Pinker's \n\u2018bioprogram\u2019 hypothesis. If creoles arise out of the \nattempts of adult learners to learn (and subsequently pass on to \ntheir children) another, non-native language, then what one might \ncall \u2018contamination of the stimulus,\u2019 rather than the \ninfluence of an inborn UG in the learner, is what accounts for the \nUG-respecting ways in which creoles are elaborated.\n\n\nHowever, there is a case of creolization in which these other \nhypotheses apparently fail to gain purchase, as Pinker (1994:37ff.) \nemphasizes. This is the case of the development of Idioma de Signos \nNicarag\u00fcense (ISN, Nicaraguan Sign Language), a brand-new \nnatural sign language which first emerged around 30 years ago in \nschools for the deaf in and around Managua. These schools were first \nset up in the 1970s, and ISN evolved from the hodge-podge of homesign\nsystems used by students who entered the schools at that time. ISN is\nan interesting test case of the bioprogram hypothesis for two \nreasons. First, homesign systems are idiosyncratic and possess little\nsyntactic structure: the natural-languagelike syntax of ISN could \ntherefore not derive from substrate influence. And Spanish, the only \npotential candidate for superstrate influence was allegedly \ninaccessible to signers because of its auditory modality. Pinker \nclaims that ISN provides another example of creolization and the \nworkings of the innate language faculty: it is \n\u201ccreated\u2026in one leap when the younger children were \nexposed to the pidgin singing of the older children.\u201d \n(1994:36-7)\n\n\nIn their discussion of the development of ISN, however, Kegl, Senghas\nand Coppola (1999) show that things are not quite this \nstraightforward. ISN did not develop \u2018in one leap,\u2019 from \nthe very rudimentary homesigns or \u2018Mimicas\u2019 spoken by \nindividual deaf students. Instead, its evolution was more gradual and\nwas preceded by the creation of what Kegl et al. call \u201cLenguage\nde Signos Nicarag\u00fcense\u201d (LSN), a kind of \u201cpidgin or \njargon\u201d (181) that \u201cdeveloped from the point when these \nhomesigners came together in the schools and began to share their \nhomesigns with each other, quickly leading to more and more shared \nsigns and grammatical devices\u201d (180). In addition, the signers \nhad access to Spanish language dictionaries, and their language was \nalso influenced by the signing of Spanish-speaking, non-deaf teachers\nat the schools \u2014 signing which likely incorporated such \ngrammatical devices of the teachers' language as were transferable to\na non-vocal medium. (K. Stromswold, private communication.)\n\n\nWhile Kegl et al. endorse the language bioprogram hypothesis that ISN\nemerged \u2018in one leap,\u2019 in the minds of children exposed \nto degraded Mimica or LSN inputs, their data are equally consistent \nwith the idea that ISN developed more gradually by means of \nsuccessive elaborations and innovations among a community of \nhighly-motivated (because language-starved) young users. Indeed, as \nKegl et al. themselves describe the history (p.187), this is \nprecisely what happened. First, a group of signers, each with his or \nher own idiosyncratic form of Mimicas, entered the schools. Members \nof this group gained in expressive power as their individual Mimicas \nwere enriched by borrowings from others' homesign systems. Then, a \nnew cohort of Mimicas signers entered the schools. Their sign systems\nbenefitted both from exposure to the Mimicas of their peers and from \nexposure to the richer system developed by the earlier group. Through\na process of successive elaborations in this manner, LSN developed \nand then, by a similar series of steps, ISN developed. At present, \nall three sign systems are still being used in Nicaragua, presumably \nreflecting the different ages at which people are exposed to language\nand the kinds of inputs (ISN or LSN vs. signed and written Spanish or\nlipreading in regular schools) they receive. In addition, ISN and to \na lesser extent LSN are still constantly changing \u2014 as one \nwould expect if ISN were a community-wide work in progress, not the \nfinished product of an individual child's mind,\n",
