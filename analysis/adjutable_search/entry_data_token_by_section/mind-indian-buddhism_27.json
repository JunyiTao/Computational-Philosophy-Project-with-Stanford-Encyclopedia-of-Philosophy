Perception is regarded as necessarily\ninvolving contact (spar\u015ba, sannikar\u1e63a)\nbetween the sense and the object. Dign\u0101ga (following Vasubandhu)\nnotes that perception is named after the sense rather than after the\nobject (see AKBh ad I, 45ab). Thus perception, following the\nsense rather than the object, cognizes inexpressible particularities\nor the object as a particular domain of experience. Indirect\nperception, which is usually understood as involving some degree of\nconceptual discrimination (vikalpakaj\u00f1\u0101na) is not\ntreated as perception proper. Unlike their principal opponents, the\nNaiy\u0101yikas and the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101kas, the Buddhist\nepistemologists do not regard indirect perception as an essential step\nin the transition from pure sense data to full blown conceptual\napprehension. \n\n\nIn his principal work, the Collection on Valid Cognition (PS\nI, k5a-6cd; Hattori 1968, 27) Dign\u0101ga discusses what appear to \nbe three distinct types of cognition under the rubric of perception: \nsense perception, mental perception, and perception of the yogi. \nDign\u0101ga also admits self-awareness (svasa\u1e43vedana)\nas a distinct type of cognition, although there is some debate about \nwhether this is to be interpreted as a type of perception (see \n \u00a77.2\n for a discussion of svasa\u1e43vedana). The disagreement \ncenters on whether self-awareness should be understood as a dual \naspect cognition (Nagatomi 1979) or as a new type of perception. \nWayman (1991), following Hattori (1968), argues that it should, \nwhereas Franco (1986, 1993) argues to the contrary. Franco bases \nhis argument on a piece of textual evidence that appears to endorse \nthe view that Dign\u0101ga takes the self-apprehension of internal \nstates such as desire to be a case of mental perception. Drawing from\nthe commentarial literature on Dign\u0101ga preserved in Chinese, Yao\n(2004) offers some compelling arguments as to why scholars, from \ntraditional commentators such as Praj\u00f1\u0101karagupta (ca. 800) \nto Franco appear to have consistently misunderstood the relationship \nbetween self-awareness and mental perception. Yao maintains that the \nresolution to the question of whether Dign\u0101ga does or does not \naccept four types of perception depends on correctly understanding \nthe function of mental perception, which he takes to apply only to \nthe direct apprehension of mental objects (2004, 63). Thus, for Yao \nmental perception (manasa-pratyak\u1e63a) and the mental \nfaculty of cognitive awareness (mano-vij\u00f1\u0101na) are \nto be clearly differentiated, the first being just an aspect of the \nlatter. Likewise, self-awareness and yogic perception too are taken \nto be just different states of this mental cognitive awareness (see \nTillemans 1989; Steinkellner 1978, 1982, 1999; and Dunne 2006 for \ndiscussions of this issue).\n\n\nBoth Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti take objects of perception to \nhave causal efficacy (see e.g., PV III, 3). What is generally termed \nperception is said to consist in a series of distinct cognitive \nevents that are causally related. On this model of perception, \ncontact between sense and object gives rise to a perceptual image \n(\u0101k\u0101ra) which represents the specific \ncharacteristics of that object. The relationship between the \nperceptual image and the empirical object is one of similarity \n(s\u0101d\u1e5b\u015bya). The perceptual image is causally \ndetermined by the object, but the manner of its appearance is \ndetermined by factors that are intrinsic to cognition itself (see, \ne.g., PV III, 333\u2013338). Although both Dign\u0101ga and \nDharmak\u012brti appear to adopt an empirical standpoint in regards \nto the status of external objects, their analysis of perceptual \naspects reflects an internalist epistemology that denies the ultimate\nreality of external objects (see PV III, 301\u2013319; \n333\u2013341; and Dunne 2004, 84\u201391). Dharmak\u012brti's \nposition regarding the reality of external objects is highly \nambivalent depending on whether he operates from a Sautr\u0101ntika \nperspective, which admits the existence of external objects, or from \na Yog\u0101c\u0101ra perspective, which denies their existence (for \ndetailed discussions of this aspect of Dharmak\u012brti's thought see\nDreyfus 1998, 83, 99; Dunne 2004, 53 and passim). \n\n\nThere is some dispute as to whether or not Dharmak\u012brti retains \nthe causal model of perception in the case of internal objects. Thus,\nDreyfus (1997, 336f) takes the view that Dharmak\u012brti is \neffectively compelled to admit that for a perceptual aspect to \nacquire cognitive status it must be interpreted. As such, it acquires\nthe status of an internal mental representation, which Dreyfus claims\nto be \u201ca highly uncomfortable position\u201d for \nDharmak\u012brti given his commitment to the view that perception \nmust be foundational for knowledge. \n\n\nIn examining Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s causal model of perception, \nDunne (2004, 100) singles out numerical correspondence as the main \nissue in establishing how perceptual images come to correspond to the\nmaterial objects they represent: the perceptual image of the object \nis singular, but the object, as an extended entity, is made of an \ninfinitesimal number of particles in accord with the atomistic \nontology to which Dharmak\u012brti subscribes. Thus, identifying the \nprecise causal mechanism by which percepts relate to their \ncorresponding empirical objects is further complicated by \nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s view of particulars. In maintaining that \nparticulars (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) are partless, \nDharmak\u012brti is forced to admit that in perception we apprehend a\nparticular in its entirely, something that of course is not borne by \nempirical data: ordinarily, in perceving a given object, say a \ndragonfly, we only perceive its visible parts from our unique vantage\npoint; we do not perceive it in its entirety. \n\n\nIn the Commentary on Valid Cognition (PV III, 194-\u2013224)\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s addresses the issue of whether perception, as\na source of knowledge, apprehends distinct spatio-temporal entities as\naggregated wholes or aggregation is a conceptual construct and thus\noutside the domain of perceptual awareness. Neither of these positions\nis acceptable, for Dharmak\u012brti, as is well known, follows\nDign\u0101ga in admiting only direct, non-conceptual types of\ncognitive awareness under the rubric of perception: thus, wholes, that\nis, entities composed or distributed over their parts, cannot be\nperceptually apprehended. Commenting on this aspect of\nDharmak\u012brti's philosophy of perception, Dunne (2004, 102) thinks\nthat in rejecting these two positions, Dharmak\u012brti effectively\nundermines his antirealist critique of the notion that perception can\napprehend real aggregated objects. In response to the objections of\nhis realist (chiefly the Naiy\u0101yika) opponent that by admitting\nthat perception has the capacity to apprehend aggregates as unitary\nwholes he is thus forced to admit that universals too are perceptible,\nDharmak\u012brti replies that \u201caggregation\u201d does not refer\nto the particular proper. Rather, it refers to a configuration of\nparticles such that it can causally support the arising of a\nperceptual image without that image being in any way related to the\nexternal aggregated object that supervenes on those particles (see\ndiscussion of this issue in Dunne 2004, 103 and\npassim).\n\n\nAs we noted above, Dign\u0101ga and, following him, Dharmak\u012brti \nrestrict perception to types of cognitive awareness that lack \nconceptual determination (kalpan\u0101po\u1e0dha). But even\ndirect perception is not always warranted, given the possibility of \nperceptual illusions. For this reason, Dharmak\u012brti adds a \nfurther constraint, by admitting as reliable only those perceptions \nthat lack conceptual determination and also are non-erroneous \n(abhr\u0101nta) (see \nPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya I, 252). In fact, by adding\nthe qualifier \u2018non-erroneous\u2019 Dharmak\u012brti is simply \nfollowing an established tradition of excluding from perception \ninstances of perceptual illusions of the sort produced by, say, the \nrapid rotation of a firebrand, or cases of sensory impairment as in \ncataracts. For perceptions to be reliable their object must be \ncausally effective. The Buddhist epistemologist solves the problem \nof the efficacy of perceptions by adopting a representationalist \nstance: perception can only reveal its object by assuming its form. \nThus, an intermediary realm of cognitive aspects \n(\u0101k\u0101ra) is posited between perception and \nconception.\n\n\nAttempts to define the nature of these cognitive aspects and their \ncognitive function are the origin of a lengthy dispute that cuts \nacross doctrinal and scholastic boundaries. Thus Dign\u0101ga and \nDharmak\u012brti follow the Sautr\u0101ntika and Yog\u0101c\u0101ra \nBuddhists who maintain that cognitive awareness has an aspectual \ncharacter: that is, cognition takes the form of whatever object it \ncognizes (a position known as \ns\u0101k\u0101r\u0101v\u0101da). The Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas \nand some M\u0101dhyamikas take the opposite view: consciousness is \nmirror-like in its nature, reflecting an object without being \nmodified by it (cf. Kajiyama 1965, 428; Moriyama 1984; Tillemans \n1990, 41f). The representational model of cognition adopted by the \nepistemologists resembles Western variants of representationalism as \nproposed by, among others, Descartes and Locke.\n\n\nFor Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti the apprehension of a \nresemblance (s\u0101d\u1e5b\u015bya) between different \nobjects, which marks the transition from an indistinct perceptual \nexperience to a distinct cognitive awareness, is in itself a form of \nconceptual elaboration. In keeping with the Abhidharma traditions, \nthe epistemologists admit that perception is mediated by our internal\npropensities as well as by the range of our perceptual systems. However,\nthey do not accept the reality of resemblance relations, even though \nthey admit that cognitive aspects (specifically those by which an object is \napprehended) are pragmatically effective. A difficulty arises when \nattempting to explain extension in the case of empirical objects, \nwhich are apprehended by means of a cognitive aspect. This difficulty\nis overcome by adopting the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra perspective on the \nself-revealing (svaprak\u0101\u015ba) nature of cognitive \nawareness. On this perspective, each instance of cognitive awareness \nhas a dual aspect: that of a subjective appearance \n(sv\u0101bh\u0101sa) and that of an objective appearance \n(vi\u1e63ay\u0101bh\u0101sa) (see Collection on Valid \nCognition, PS I, k9a; Hattori 1968, 28). The subjective aspect \n(gr\u0101hak\u0101k\u0101ra) denotes the sense of \nintimation that accompanies each cognitive event, while the objective\naspect (gr\u0101hy\u0101k\u0101ra) captures the intentional \ncharacter of cognition or its object-directedness. This dual aspect \ntheory of cognitive awareness endorses the existence\nof a meta-cognitive level of analysis, which explains why cognition does \nnot happen \u201cin the dark\u201d; rather, it is always accompanied by \nself-intimation, by an experience of \u201cwhat it is like\u201d to\nbe apprehending a given object (cf. Ganeri 1999).\n",
