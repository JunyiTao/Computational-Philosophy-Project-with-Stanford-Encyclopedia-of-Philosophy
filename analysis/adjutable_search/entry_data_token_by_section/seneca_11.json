    "main_text": "Physics and Theology || The Natural Law\n5.3 God\n\nThe study of nature\u2014of the heavens\u2014eventually leads to\nknowledge of God (or at least, to the beginnings of such an\nunderstanding; NQ 1.13). Seneca characterizes God in a number\nof ways: (i) God is everything one sees and everything one does not\nsee. Nothing greater than his magnitude is conceivable\n(magnitudo [\u2026] qua nihil maius cogitari\npotest); he alone is everything\u2014he keeps together his work\nfrom the inside and the outside (NQ 1.13). (ii) God is\ncompletely soul (animus) and reason (ratio) (1.14),\nor, as Seneca puts it in Letter 65.12, \u201creason in\naction\u201d (ratio faciens). (iii) Like earlier Stoics,\nSeneca emphasizes that God (\u2018Jupiter\u2019) can be referred to\nby many names: fate, the cause of causes (causa causarum),\nprovidence, nature, universe (NQ 2.45.2). (iv) Seneca agrees\nwith the orthodox Stoic view that God is corporeal. God is a part of\nthe world (pars mundi; NQ 7.30.4). At the same time,\nhe emphasizes that it is in thought that we have to see\nGod\u2014he flees human eyes. The study of God is thus not the study\nof a visible entity (7.30.3\u20135). (v) God, or nature, is\nbeneficial (5.18.13\u201315). Two of these ideas are\nparticularly important to Seneca\u2019s ethics. Much of Book 4 of\nOn Benefits is devoted to the fact that God is beneficial\n(4.3.3\u20134.9.1). It is through the example of God\u2019s goodness\nthat Seneca aims to explain why giving should really not be done with\na view to one\u2019s own advantage: there is no advantage that God\ncould possibly gain from us, and yet God benefits all of us (4.3.3).\nIndeed, God is the ultimate source of benefits; as cause of all\ncauses, God is also the cause of everything that is good for us, and\nthat includes the sun, the seasons, and so on. This connects to the\npoint that God is referred to by many names. Seneca envisages the\nobjection that these gifts do not come from God, but from nature; but\nwhoever makes this objection fails to understand that nature is but\nanother name for God (4.7.1).\n\nEarlier Stoic theology is partly developed in conversation with and\ncontradistinction from Epicurean theology. The central point of\ncontention in this debate is whether God concerns himself with us,\nwhether he is caring in the sense of attending to the details of how\nour lives are going. Seneca clearly shares the orthodox Stoic view\nthat God is supremely caring. For example, Seneca describes the way in\nwhich God made the world as if he had built a wonderfully stable and\nbeautiful house to present to us as a gift (4.6.2). In response to the\nquestion of how we know that there are gods, the earlier Stoics argued\nthat every human being has a preconception of God. Seneca offers a\nversion of this. The common practice of praying would be\n\u201cinsane\u201d if there were no caring God. People would be\naddressing deities who are deaf (4.4.2). The fact that people\neverywhere seem to turn to God in prayer indicates for Seneca that\nthere must be a caring God.\n\nSeneca further agrees with earlier Stoic physics in taking divination\nseriously. In his discussions of thunder and lightning in the\nNatural Questions, Seneca explains that, while every natural\nevent is a sign, we should not think of God busying himself\nwith sending us, as it were, a sign at every particular occasion.\nRather, we should explain natural events by seeking out their natural\ncauses, and at the same time understand that the order of things as a\nwhole is established by God. Since there is this order, divination is\npossible (NQ 2.32.1\u20134). Fate is the necessity of all\nevents and actions, which no power can disrupt (2.36). Prayer cannot\nchange fate; but since the gods have left some things unresolved,\nprayer can be effective (2.37.2).\n\nLike other ancient philosophers, Seneca discusses virtue as the ideal\nof \u201cbecoming like God.\u201d This is, however, not an\notherworldly ideal\u2014rather, it is the ideal of perfecting our\nrationality, as agents living in this world (Russell 2004). We are\na part of God; to perfect our reason is to achieve the perfect\nrationality of divinity. In agreement with earlier Stoics, Seneca\nthinks that the virtuous man is an equal to the gods (Letter\n92.30\u201331; 87.19). Seneca\u2019s natural philosophy and his\ntheology are thus closely related to his ethics and philosophical\npsychology. Ultimately, he is concerned with how we can perfect our\nsoul, and he pursues this question in a variety of ways\u2014by\ndiscussing virtue, the soul, nature, and theology.\n",
