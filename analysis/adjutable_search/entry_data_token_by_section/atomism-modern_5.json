    "main_text": "Newtonian Atomism || Newton's Atomism\n3.1 Newton's Atomism\n\n\nThe key sources of Newton's stance on atomism in his published work\nare Querie 31 of his Opticks, and a short piece on acids\n(Cohen, 1958, 257\u20138). Atomistic views also make their appearance in\nthe Principia, where Newton claimed \u201cthe least parts of\nbodies to be\u2014all extended, and hard and impenetrable, and\nmoveable, and endowed with their proper inertia\u201d (Cajori, 1962,\n399). If we temporarily set aside Newton's introduction of his concept\nof force, then Newton's basic matter theory can be seen as a version\nof mechanical atomism improved by drawing on the mechanics of the\nPrincipia. Whereas mechanical atomists prior to Newton had\nbeen unclear about the nature and status of the laws governing atoms,\nNewton was able to presume that his precisely formulated three laws of\nmotion, shown to apply in a wide variety of astronomical and\nterrestrial settings, applied to atoms also. Those laws provided the\nlaw of inertia governing motion of atoms in between collisions and\nlaws of impact governing collisions. Newton also added his precise and\ntechnical notion of inertia or mass, another fruit of his new\nmechanics, to the list of primary properties of atoms. These moves\ncertainly helped to give precise content to the fundamental tenets of\nmechanical atomism that they had previously lacked.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that Newton shared the assumption of the Ancient and\nmechanical atomists that there is just one kind of homogeneous matter\nof which all atoms are composed. This is clear from the way in which\nNewton explained differing densities of observable matter in terms of\nthe amount of space intervening between the component atoms.  Newton\nargued, for instance that the ratio of space to volume occupied by\natoms was seventeen times greater in water than in gold on the grounds\nthat gold is seventeen times more dense. The fact that thin gold films\ntransmit light convinced Newton that the atoms of gold already\ncontains enough space to permit the transmission of light\nparticles. The preponderance of space between the atoms of matter,\nhowever bulky or solid they might appear at the observational and\nexperimental level, became a characteristic feature of Newtonian\natomism, as Thackray (1968) has stressed.\n\n\nThe picture of Newton's atomism as an elaboration and improvement of\nmechanical atomism becomes untenable once the role of force in\nNewton's theorising is taken into account. There is no doubting that\nNewton's introduction of forces, especially the gravitational force,\ninto his mechanics was a major scientific success borne out by\nobservational and experimental evidence. Newton famously speculated in\nthe Preface to the Principia (Cajori, 1958, xviii), that if\nall forces operative in nature, including those acting between the\nsmallest, unobservable, particles, were known, then the whole course\nof nature could be encompassed within his mechanics.  However, the\nfulfilment of such a dream would not constitute the fruition of the\nmechanical philosophy because of the ontological problems posed by the\nconcept of force.\n\n\nNewton explicitly rejected the idea that gravitation, or any other\nforce, be essential to matter. But the major point of mechanical\natomism had been to admit as properties of atoms only those that they\nmust, essentially, have as pieces of matter. It was in this way that\nthey had endeavoured to avoid introducing Aristotelian forms and\nqualities, which they regarded as incomprehensible from an ontological\npoint of view. The introduction of forces as irreducible entities flew\nin the face of the major aim of the mechanical philosophers for\nclarity and intelligibility on ontological matters. Newton was unable\nto fashion an unambiguous view on the ontological status of gravity, a\nforce manifest at the level of observation and experiment, let alone\nforces operative at the atomic level. It is true that, in the case of\ngravity, Newton had a plausible pragmatic response. He argued that,\nwhatever the underlying status of the force of gravity might be, he\nhad given a precise specification of that force with his law of\ngravitation and had employed the force to explain a range of phenomena\nat the astronomical and terrestrial level, explanations that had been\nconfirmed by observation and experiment. But not even a pragmatic\njustification such as this could be offered for forces at the atomic\nlevel.\n\n\nMechanical atomism had faced the problem of how to introduce the\nappropriate kinds of activity into the world relying solely on the\nshapes, sizes and motions of atoms. They had struggled unsuccessfully\nto explain elasticity and gravity along such lines and chemistry posed\nproblems of its own. Newtonian forces could readily be deployed to\nremove these problems. Newton presumed that forces of characteristic\nstrengths (affinities) operated between the least parts of chemicals.\nWhat displaces what in a chemical reaction is to be explained simply\nin terms of the relative strengths of the affinities\ninvolved. Elasticity was attributed to attractive and repulsive forces\nacting between particles of an elastic substance and so on.\n\n\nNewton developed theories of optics and chemistry that were atomistic\nin the weak sense that they sought to explain optical and chemical\nproperties by invoking interacting particles lying beyond the range of\nobservation. However, the particles were not ultimate.  Newton's\nposition on the least parts of chemical substances was similar to that\nof Boyle and other mechanical philosophers. They were regarded as made\nup of a hierarchy of yet smaller particles. So long as the smallest\nparticles were held together by forces, the problem of the ontological\nstatus of the forces remained. The least parts of chemicals in\nNewton's theory were akin to natural minima with the added detail that\ntheir action was due to attractive and repulsive forces. As far as the\nparticles of light in Newton's optics are concerned, whether they were\nultimate or not, they too acted by way of forces and also suffered\nfits of easy reflection and easy refraction, the latter being used to\nexplain interference phenomena such as Newton\u2019s rings and why a\nray incident on a boundary between two refracting media can be\npartially reflected and partially transmitted.\n\n\nHowever attractive the reduction of the material world to particles\ninteracting by way of forces may have appeared, it must be recognised\nthat there was scant empirical support for the idea. This point is\nclearest in the context of chemistry. The affinities presumed to act\nbetween chemical \u2018atoms\u2019 were postulated solely on the\nbasis of the observed chemical behaviour of bulk substances\nmanipulated in the laboratory. The assumption that the chemical\nbehaviour of bulk substances were due to combining atoms added nothing\nthat made a difference to what was testable by experiment. Observed\nproperties of chemical substances were simply projected onto\natoms. Newtonians had not formulated a chemical atomic theory that\ncould be used as a basis for the prediction of chemical phenomena at\nthe experimental level.  Newton's optics was in an analogous\nsituation. However, here it can be said that that optical theory was\nable to accommodate a range of optical phenomena in a coherent way\nthat rendered it superior to any rival. The result was the widespread\nacceptance of the theory in the eighteenth century.\n\n\nWhen Newton took for granted that there is just one kind of universal\nmatter and refused to include gravity as a primary property of matter\nbecause of worries about the ontological status of force, he was\nplaying the role of a natural philosopher in the tradition of the\nmechanical philosophy. When he offered a pragmatic justification of\nhis specification of the force of gravity independently of how that\nforce might be explained he was acting as one who sought to develop an\nexperimentally confirmed science independent of the kinds of ultimate\nexplanation sought by the mechanical philosophers. His atomism\ncontained elements of both of these tendencies. A sympathiser could\nsay that whatever the philosophical problems posed by forces,\nNewtonian atomism was a speculation that at least held the promise of\nexplaining material phenomena in a way that mechanical atomism did not\nand so experimental support in the future was a possibility. A critic,\non the other hand, could argue that, from the philosophical\nperspective, the introduction of force undermined the case for the\nclarity and intelligibility of mechanical atomism on which its\noriginators had based their case. From a scientific point of view,\nthere was no significant empirical support for atomism and it was\nunable to offer useful guidance to the experimental sciences that grew\nand prospered in the seventeenth century and beyond.\n",
