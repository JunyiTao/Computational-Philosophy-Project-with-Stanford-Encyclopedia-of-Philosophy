    "main_text": "The Problem of Motivation\n4. The Problem of Motivation\n\n\nThe principles of moral reasoning and discourse require effective\ncausation in order to realize agency. In a series of closely related\narguments\u2014the Mental Principle Argument, the Moral Principle\nArgument, and the Memory versus Recall Argument\u2014Crummell begins\nto describe this relationship. According to his Mental Principle\nArgument, the god worshipped by a people elevates or debases them\nsince \u201cthe abstract principle that the idea of God contains,\ninherently, such transforming power in a nation, that it makes or\nunmakes, according as it is clear, and right, and grand; or, on the\nother hand, is low, and rude, and sensual\u201d (\u201cGod and the\nNation\u201d [FA], 154). \u201cNational greatness\u201d\ncorrelates with these ideas, a point he thinks is obvious.  While\nthought may be the spur to enterprise and organized society, the\n\u201cgenerative principle\u201d of the \u201cactive power and\nactivity\u201d of mind is the idea of God (155). It is not that God\nsimply determines which actions and events occur, but that the idea of\nGod causes human thought to generate the varied activities of civil\nsociety, and so \u201cmagnifies a nation's mind\u201d leading to\n\u201cdevelopment in every mode and direction\u201d (158). Being\noriented to the future in turn leads individuals to make an enduring\nnation that can survive them. Crummell is convinced that blacks are\nwell suited to legacy-building because of their \u201cplastic\u201d\nnature possessing that \u201cnative mobility and adaptedness\u201d\nrequired to withstand \u201celements diverse from and stronger than\ntheir own\u201d; blacks are patient enough \u201cto wait for the\nfuture, in calm abidance and with confident assurance\u201d\n(\u201cHope for Africa\u201d [FA], 321). He rejects the\ncounter-argument that individuals are mortal, and since nations are\nsimply aggregates of individuals they are likewise mortal. Over and\nabove such aggregates nations are societies \u201cin an organized\nstate, under the influence and control of broad principles and\nsuperior ideas\u201d (\u201cGod and the Nation,\u201d\n161). Reason's activity is civilizing, leading directly to a further\nprogressive development of that reason.\n\n\nAccording to Crummell's Moral Principle Argument, just as the\nmigration of populations is a fact of human life, occurring throughout\nhuman history, so too is the moral history of meaning and action that\nis built up around it. He takes this to be providential, not\naccidental. We may \u201cdiscover evidences of a large and\ncomprehensive plan, which excludes all ideas of the accidental or\nadventitious\u201d (\u201cEmigration, an Aid to the Civilization of\nAfrica\u201d [AA], 412). Human events in general accord with\nGod's \u201cgrand moral economy\u201d in which God is an\n\u201cever-active agent\u201d (413). Crummell acknowledges that\n\u201cour finite vision\u201d often \u201cfail[s] the\ndiscovery\u201d of genuine moral ends. Consistent with his\ndeontological understanding of moral obligation, as well as his\nrealism about the moral, the effort to discover and examine moral ends\nby the reasoning agent is essentially an application of our mental\nfaculties to scrutable moral problems, a mental task assigned by\nGod. As the active, directing force and principle, the will of God\n\u201coverrules all the deeds, the counsels, and the designs of men,\nand tracks them from their unseen germs, \u2026to those manifest and\nnotable deeds which rank among historic facts\u201d (413).\n\n\nHence a link between the Moral Principle Argument and the Mental\nPrinciple Argument: an active principle of thought causes action, is\nthe subject of history, and has God as its source. If those deeds are\ngood, then they are God-caused (regardless of any purported\ncausal contribution by the agent). God supplies the suggestion,\nadjustment, direction, and order of the deeds \u201cso that while men act on\ntheir own personal responsibility, they nevertheless act either\nconsciously or unconsciously as the agents of God\u201d (414). Thus we\ncannot override God's will. And if those deeds are evil, then they are\nGod-exploited, since God distracts that which is evil and\ndirects us to providentially approved ends. To the counter-argument\nthat God is not concerned with secular history, Crummell argues that\nthat would imply that there exists some non-God that governs the\nsecular, thus dividing \u201cthe moral government of God,\u201d an absurdity. In\nany case, God's hand is evident throughout history. A moral vanguard is\nto respond in an active way to Mental and Moral Principles and affect\nthe course of history, thereby increasing the civilization potential of\nthose principles for future generations. \u201cThe hand of God is on the\nblack man, in all the lands of his distant sojourn, for the good of\nAfrica\u201d (\u201cEmigration,\u201d 421); God thus intervenes in history and uses blacks as his\nagents, creating an additional impetus for blacks to affect history's\ncourse. Crummell is a moral vanguardist in this way, since an advance\n\u201cremnant\u201d of the people does the work of God.\n\n\nHis Memory versus Recall Argument reveals the limitations of\nsuch vanguards. He recounts in his 1891 book Africa and\nAmerica a sharp public exchange he has with Douglass over the\neffect of actively recalling how slavery degraded black\nlife. Douglass, ever the activist, thought such recall was\ninspirational, motivating moral progress, while the relentlessly\nanalytical Crummell thought it dispiriting and morally regressive. He\ndecried what he saw as the \u201cirresistible tendency in the Negro\nmind in this land to dwell morbidly and absorbingly upon the servile\npast\u201d to the detriment of the needs of the future. Active recall\nof slavery, he argued, jeopardized black moral progress (\u201cThe\nNeed of New Ideas and New Aims for a New Era\u201d [AA],\n18\u201319). Of course it \u201cis not the memory of slavery\u201d\nto be guarded against \u201cbut the constant recollection of it, as\nthe commanding thought of a new people, who should be marching on to\nthe broadest freedom of thought in a new and glorious present, and a\nstill more magnificent future.\u201d Memory is passive, as \u201cthe\nnecessary and unavoidable entrance, storage and recurrence of facts\nand ideas to the understanding and the consciousness.\u201d But\nrecollection is a mental action, \u201cthe actual seeking of the\nfacts, \u2026the painstaking endeavor of the mind to bring them back\nagain to consciousness.\u201d By the \u201claw of\nassociation,\u201d then, it tends to \u201cdegradation.\u201d\n\n\nLanguage plays a central role in this process, echoing the point he\nmakes about the English language in Africa. \u201cWords are vital\nthings,\u201d explained Crummell, since they are \u201calways\ngenerative of life or death\u201d and cannot \u201center the soul as\npassive and inoperative things\u201d (19).  Moreover, to be limited\nin word and thought is to undermine moral reasoning, which is the\ncondition of the \u201csavage.\u201d On the other hand, the\n\u201cchanged circumstances\u201d of blacks generate \u201can\nimmense budget of new thoughts, new ideas, new projects, new purposes,\nnew ambitions, of which our fathers never thought\u201d\n(19\u201320).\n",
