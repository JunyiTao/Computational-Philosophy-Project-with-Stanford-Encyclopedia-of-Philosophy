    "main_text": "\n\nWilhelm Maximilian Wundt (1832\u20131920) is known to posterity as\nthe \u201cfather of experimental psychology\u201d and the founder of\nthe first psychology laboratory (Boring 1950: 317, 322,\n 344\u20135),[1]\n whence he exerted enormous influence on the development of psychology\nas a discipline, especially in the United States. Reserved and shy in\npublic (cf. Kusch 1995: 249, f.), Wundt aggressively dominated his\nchosen arenas, the lecture hall and the pages of books, with a witty\nand sardonic persona (cf., e.g., Wundt 1911a: 61; Boring 1950: 317).\nHis scope was vast, his output incredible. His writings, totaling an\nestimated 53,000 pages, include: articles on animal and human\nphysiology, poisons, vision, spiritualism, hypnotism, history, and\npolitics; text- and handbooks of \u201cmedical physics\u201d and\nhuman physiology; encyclopedic tomes on linguistics, logic, ethics,\nreligion, a \u201csystem of philosophy;\u201d not to mention his\nmagna opera, the Grundz\u00fcge der physiologischen\nPsychologie and the V\u00f6lkerpsychologie (in ten\n volumes).[2]\n Although his work spans several disciplines\u2014physiology,\npsychology, and philosophy\u2014Wundt would not have considered\nhimself an \u201cinterdisciplinary\u201d or\n\u201cpluralistic\u201d thinker: he was to the core a\nfoundationalist, whose great ambition was establishing a\nphilosophico-scientific system of knowledge, practice, and politics\n(see\n Section 7,\n below) (Boring 1950: 327). Despite his intentions, however, the sheer\nlength of his career (some 65 years) and the volume of his output make\nit hard to speak of a coherent Wundtian\n doctrine.[3]\n His corpus is riven by tensions and ambiguities, and though\nhis work has undergone periodic scholarly reconsiderations,\nWundt\u2019s lasting importance for the field of psychology remains\nthe topic of lively debate among\n psychologists.[4]\n\nFor philosophers, Wundt is worth studying for two reasons. First, the\narguments he made more than a century ago for the legitimacy of a\nnon-reductionist account of consciousness offer both challenges and\nresources to contemporary psychology and philosophy of mind alike.\nShould those arguments be found lacking, there remains a second,\nperhaps more important reason to read him: not understanding Wundt is\nto tolerate a lacuna at a crucial nexus of the recent history of\nphilosophy. Not only was he a powerful influence (albeit mostly by\nrepulsion) upon the founders of Pragmatism, Phenomenology, and\nneo-Kantianism, it was also Wundt and his pioneering students who\ndeveloped the empirical methodologies that first granted psychology a\ndisciplinary identity distinct from philosophy. It is these\nphilosophically germane aspects of his thought that this article\ndescribes.\n",
