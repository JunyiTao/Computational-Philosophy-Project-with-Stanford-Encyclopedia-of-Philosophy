    "main_text": "Epistemology\n3. Epistemology\n\nThroughout her life, Weil argued that knowledge in and of the world\ndemanded rigorous, balanced thinking, even if that difficulty and\nmeasurement led the thinker to near-impossible tasks. For her these\ntasks of thinking included, for instance, her attempt to synthesize\nperspectives of intricate Catholic doctrine on the threshold of the\nChurch with wisdom from various traditions such as ancient Greek\nphilosophy and tragedies, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism. Following\nAeschylus, she believed knowledge was gained through suffering. Shaped\nby her social-political and religious thought, Weil\u2019s\nepistemology would change over time, especially in light of her\nmystical experiences.\n\nIn her dissertation, Weil attempts to think with Descartes in order to\nfind foundational knowledge. Like Descartes, she argues for the\nexistence of self, God, and world. Her cogito, however, was a\ndecisive break from his: \u201cI can, therefore I am\u201d (Je\npuis, donc je suis) (1929\u20131930 \u201cScience and\nPerception in Descartes\u201d, FW 59). The self has the power of\nfreedom, Weil argues, but something else\u2014the omnipotent,\nGod\u2014makes the self realize that it is not all-powerful.\nSelf-knowledge, then, is capability always qualified by the\nacknowledgment that one is not God. She maintained a kind of Cartesian\nepistemology during her time as a teacher, early in her academic life.\nIn Lectures on Philosophy (1978 LP), a collection of lecture\nnotes taken by one of her students during the academic year\n1933\u20131934 at a girl\u2019s lyc\u00e9e in Roanne, we\nfind that Weil is initially critical of sensations as grounds for\nknowledge, and thereby critical of empiricist epistemology (LP\n43\u201347).\n\nFrom her early writings onward she was to problematize the imagination\nas the \u201cfolle imagination\u201d, a barrier between\nmind and reality, meaning that the human knower is kept from\nthings-in-themselves. Weil\u2019s epistemology, then, informed by her\ninitial studies of Descartes, would take on inflections of Kant and\nPlato while positioning her against Aristotle. She was critical of any\nsensation that universalizes one\u2019s reading of the world, and she\nsaw the imagination as thus extending the self, because it could not\nhelp but filter phenomena through its own categories, wishes, and\ndesires, thereby reading the world on its own terms. Relatedly, Weil\nwould develop an intersubjective epistemology. Knowing the truth\nrequires not extending one\u2019s own limited perspective, but\nsuspending or abandoning it such that reality\u2014including the\nreality of the existence of others\u2014could appear on its own\nterms. This suspension involves a practice of epistemic humility and\nopenness to all ideas; intelligence for Weil demands the qualified use\nof language, acknowledgement of degrees, proportions, contingencies,\nand relations, as well as an ability to call the self into question.\nThese epistemic practices are part of a broader recognition that the\nindividual knower is limited.\n\nThe progression of Weil\u2019s epistemology can be seen first in her\nconceptualization of contradiction. By Lectures on\nPhilosophy, she affirmed a sense of contradiction beyond the\nlogical conjunction \u201ca is b\u201d and\n\u201ca is not-b\u201d. Indeed, she argues that\ncontradiction can be a generative obstacle in that it requires the\nmind to expand its thinking in order to transcend the obstacle.\nDrawing on the mathematics of Eudoxus, she elaborates on this notion\nto claim that incommensurables can be reconciled when set on a kind of\n\u201chigher plane\u201d. This is not, however, a type of Hegelian\nsynthesis that can be intellectually apprehended. Instead, the\ncontemplation of contradictions can lead the knower to a higher\ncontemplation of truth-as-mystery. Thus, in her late epistemology Weil\npresents this concept of \u201cmystery\u201d as a certain kind of\ncontradiction in which incommensurables appear linked in an\nincomprehensible unity.\n\nMystery, as a conceptualization of contradiction, carries theological,\nor at least supernatural, implications. For instance, if contradiction\nis understood through formal logic, then the existence of affliction\nwould seemingly prove the nonexistence of an omnipotent, wholly\nbenevolent God; however, contradiction, understood as mystery, can\nitself serve as a mediation, allowing for the coexistence of\naffliction and God, seen most prominently on the Cross. Indeed, Christ\nis the religious solution to Weil\u2019s principal contradiction,\nthat between the necessary and the good. Moreover, through incarnation\nthat opens onto universality, Christ also manifests and solves the\ncontradiction of the individual and the collectivity. Thus, in a\nmodification of the Pythagorean idea of harmony, she claims that\nChrist allows for \u201cthe just balance of contraries\u201d\n(\u201cSpiritual Autobiography\u201d, WFG 33). More broadly, in her\n1941 \u201cThe Pythagorean Doctrine\u201d, she argues that\nmathematics are a bridge between the natural and eternal (or between\nhumans and God). That is, the Pythagoreans held an intellectual\nsolution to apparent natural contradictions. Inspired by Pythagoras,\nshe claimed that the very study of mathematics can be a means of\npurification in light of the principles of proportion and the\nnecessary balancing of contraries\u2014especially in geometry. She\nsaw in the Pythagorean legacy and spirit a link between their\nmathematical insights and their distinctly religious project to\npenetrate the mysteries of the cosmos.\n\nAs opposed to the suppression or dissolution of contradictions, as in\nsystematic philosophy, in Weil\u2019s value-centered philosophy\ncontradictions are to be presented honestly and tested on different\nlevels; for her, they are \u201cthe criterion of the real\u201d and\ncorrespond with the orientation of detachment (GG 98). For example,\nChrist\u2019s imperative to \u201clove your enemies\u201d contains\na contradiction in value: love those who are detestable and who\nthreaten the vulnerability of loving. For Weil, submitting to this\nunion of contraries loosens one\u2019s attachments to particular,\nego-driven perspectives and enables a \u201cwell-developed\nintellectual pluralism\u201d (Springsted 2010: 97). She writes,\n\u201cAn attachment to a particular thing can only be destroyed by an\nattachment which is incompatible with it\u201d (GG 101). With these\nphilosophical moves in mind, Robert Chenavier argues that she has not\na philosophy of perception, a phenomenology, but rather, borrowing\nGaston Bachelard\u2019s phrase, a \u201cdynamology of\ncontradiction\u201d (Chenavier 2009 [2012: 25]).\n\nOverall, Weil\u2019s presentation of contradiction is more\nPythagorean or Platonic than it is Marxian: it takes up contradiction\nnot through resolution on the level of things, but through dialectics\non the level of thought, where mystery is the beginning and end-point\nof thought (Springsted 2010: 97). In her unfinished essay \u201cIs\nThere a Marxist Doctrine?\u201d, from her time in London, Weil\nwrites,\n\n\nContradiction in matter is imaged by the clash of forces coming from\ndifferent directions. Marx purely and simply attributed to social\nmatter this movement towards the good through contradictions, which\nPlato described as being that of the thinking creature drawn upwards\nby the supernatural operation of grace. (OL 180)\n\n\nShe follows the Greek usage of \u201cdialectics\u201d to consider\n\u201cthe virtue of contradiction as support for the soul drawn\nupwards by grace\u201d (or the good); Marx errs, she thought, in\ncoupling such a movement with \u201cmaterialism\u201d (OL 181).\n\nA second central epistemological concept for Weil is\n\u201creading\u201d (lecture). Reading is a kind\nof interpretation of what is presented to knowers by both their\nphysical sensations and their social conditions; therefore,\nreading\u2014as the reception and attribution of certain meanings in\nthe world\u2014is always mediated. In turn, readings are mediated\nthrough other readings, since our perception of meaning is undoubtedly\ninvolved in and affected by an intersubjective web of interpretations.\nWeil explains this through the metaphor, borrowed from Descartes, of a\nblind man\u2019s stick. We can read a situation through attention to\nanother in order to expand our awareness and sensitivity, just as the\nblind man enlarges his sensibility through the use of his stick. But\nour readings of the world can also become more narrow and simplistic,\nas for instance, when a context of violence and force tempts us to see\neveryone we encounter as a potential threat. Moreover, readings are\nnot free from power dynamics and can become projects of imposition and\nintervention; here her epistemology connects to her social-political\nphilosophy, specifically to her concept of force.\n\n\nWe read, but also we are read by, others. Interferences in these\nreadings. Forcing someone to read himself as we read him (slavery).\nForcing others to read us as we read ourselves (conquest). (NB 43)\n\n\nShe connects reading to war and imagination: \u201cWar is a way of\nimposing another reading of sensations, a pressure upon the\nimagination of others\u201d (NB 24). In her 1941 \u201cEssay on the\nConcept of Reading\u201d (LPW 21\u201327) Weil elaborates,\n\u201cWar, politics, eloquence, art, teaching, all action on others\nessentially consists in changing what they read\u201d (LPW 26). In\nthe same essay she develops \u201creading\u201d in relation to the\naforementioned epistemological concepts of appearance, the empirical\nworld, and contradiction:\n\n\n[A]t each instant of our life we are gripped from the outside, as it\nwere, by meanings that we ourselves read in appearances. That is why\nwe can argue endlessly about the reality of the external world, since\nwhat we call the world are the meanings that we read; they are not\nreal. But they seize us as if they were external; that is real. Why\nshould we try to resolve this contradiction when the more important\ntask of thought in this world is to define and contemplate insoluble\ncontradictions, which, as Plato said, draw us upwards? (LPW 22)\n\n\nIt is important to note that for Weil, we are not simply passive in\nour readings. That is, we can learn to change our readings of the\nworld or of others. An elevated transformation in reading, however,\ndemands an apprenticeship in loving God through the things of this\nworld\u2014a kind of attentiveness that will also entail certain\nbodily involvements, labors, postures, and experiences. Particular\nreadings result from particular ways of living. Ideally for her, we\nwould read the natural as illuminated by the supernatural. This\nconceptualization of reading involves recognition on hierarchical\nlevels, as she explains in her notebooks:\n\n\nTo read necessity behind sensation, to read order behind necessity, to\nread God behind order. We must love all facts, not for their\nconsequences, but because in each fact God is there present. But that\nis tautological. To love all facts is nothing else than to read God in\nthem. (NB 267)\n\n\nThus the world is known as a kind of text featuring several\nsignifications on several stages, levels, or domains.\n\nWeil\u2019s epistemology grounds her critique of modern science. In\nThe Need for Roots she advocates for a science conducted\n\u201caccording to methods of mathematical precision, and at the same\ntime maintained in close relationship with religious faith\u201d (NR\n288). Through contemplation of the natural world via this kind of\nscience, the world could be read on multiple levels. The knower,\nreading thus, would understand that the order of the world is the same\nas a unity, but different on its myriad levels:\n\n\nwith respect to God [it] is eternal Wisdom; with respect to the\nuniverse, perfect obedience; with respect to our love, beauty; with\nrespect to our intelligence, balance of necessary relations; with\nrespect to our flesh, brute force. (NR 288\u2013289)\n\n\nAs in her social-political thought, in her epistemology Weil is a kind\nof anti-modern. She sees modern science and epistemology as a project\nof self-expansion that forgets limit and thinks the world should be\nsubject to human power and autonomy. Labor (especially physical labor,\nsuch as farming), then, also assumes an epistemological role for her.\nBy heteronomously subjecting the individual to necessity on a daily\nbasis, it at once contradicts self-aggrandizement and allows for a\nmore balanced reading: the intelligence qualifies itself as it reads\nnecessary relations simultaneously on multiple levels. This reading on\ndifferent levels, and inflected through faith, amounts to a kind of\nnon-reading, in that it is detached, impersonal and impartial. Through\nthese predicates \u201creading\u201d is connected to her social\nthought, aesthetics, and religious philosophy. That is, in her later\nthought Weil\u2019s epistemology relies on a time-out-of-mind\nmetaphysics for justification. Analogous to aesthetic taste, spiritual\ndiscernment\u2014God-given and graceful\u2014allows the abdicated\nself to read from a universal perspective at its most developed stage.\nThus, she argued, one can love equally and indiscriminately, just as\nthe sun shines or the rain falls without preference.\n",
