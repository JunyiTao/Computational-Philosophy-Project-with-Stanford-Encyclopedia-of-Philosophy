    "main_text": "Contractarianism and Justice || Rawls\n5.2 Rawls\n\nJohn Rawls\u2019 theory of justice is the most widely-cited example\nof a contractarian theory, but before outlining it, two words of\ncaution are necessary. First, the shape of the theory has evolved from\nits first incarnation in Rawls (1958) through his major work A\nTheory of Justice (Rawls 1971) and on to Rawls (1993) and Rawls\n(2001). Second, although Rawls has consistently claimed that the\nprinciples of justice he defends are the principles that would be\nselected by people in a suitably designed \u2018original\nposition\u2019 in which they are asked to choose the social and\npolitical institutions they will live under \u2013 this is what\nqualifies his theory as contractarian \u2013 it is less clear how\nimportant a role the contract itself plays in his thinking. His\nprinciples, which are discussed elsewhere (see the entry on\n John Rawls),\n can be defended on their own merits as a theory of social justice for\na modern liberal society, even if their contractual grounding proves\nto be unsound. Rawls presents the contracting parties as seeking to\nadvance their own interests as they decide which principles to favour,\nbut under two informational constraints. First, they are not allowed\nto know their own \u2018conception of the good\u2019 \u2013 what\nends they personally find it most valuable to pursue \u2013 so the\nprinciples must be couched in terms of \u2018primary goods\u2019,\nunderstood as goods that it is better to have more rather than less of\nwhatever conception of the good you favour. Second, they are placed\nbehind a \u2018veil of ignorance\u2019 that deprives them of any\nknowledge of personal characteristics, such as their gender, their\nplace in society, or the talents and skills they possess. This means\nthat they have no basis on which to bargain for advantage, and have to\nconsider themselves as generic persons who might be male or female,\ntalented or untalented, and so forth. In consequence, Rawls argues,\nall will choose to live under impartial principles that work to\nno-one\u2019s advantage in particular.\n\nThe problem for Rawls, however, is to show that the principles that\nwould be selected in such an original position are in fact\nrecognizable as principles of justice. One might expect the\nparties to calculate how to weigh the primary goods (which Rawls\ncatalogues as \u2018rights and liberties, opportunities and powers,\nincome and wealth\u2019) against each other, and then to choose as\ntheir social principle \u2018maximise the weighted sum of primary\ngoods, averaged across all persons\u2019. This, however, would bring\nthe theory very close to utilitarianism, since the natural method of\nweighing primary goods is to ask how much utility having a given\nquantity of each is likely, on average, to bring (for the claim that\nutilitarianism would be chosen in a Rawlsian original position, see\nHarsanyi 1975). Since Rawls wishes to reject utilitarianism, he has to\nadjust the psychology of the parties in the original position so that\nthey reason differently. Thus he suggests that, at least in developed\nsocieties, people have special reason to prioritise liberty over the\nother goods and to ensure that it is equally distributed: he argues\nthat this is essential to safeguard their self-respect. In later\nwriting his argument is less empirical: now the parties to the\ncontract are endowed with \u2018moral powers\u2019 that must be\nexercised, and it is then fairly easy to show that this requires them\nto have a set of basic liberties.\n\nWhen he turns to the distribution of income and wealth, Rawls has to\nshow why his choosers would pick the difference principle, which\nconsiders only the position of the worst-off social group, over other\nprinciples such as maximising average income across the whole society.\nIn Theory of Justice he does this by attributing special\npsychological features to the choosers that make it appropriate for\nthem to follow the \u2018maximin\u2019 rule for decisions under\nuncertainty (choose the option whose worst possible outcome is least\nbad for you). For example, they are said to be much more concerned to\nachieve the minimum level of income that the difference principle\nwould guarantee them than to enjoy increases above that level. In his\nlater work, he abandons this reliance on maximin reasoning and gives\ngreater prominence to another argument hinted at in Theory.\nThis portrays the contracting parties as starting out from the\npresumption that income and wealth should be distributed equally, but\nthen recognizing that all can benefit by permitting certain\ninequalities to arise. When these inequalities are governed by the\ndifference principle, they can be justified to everyone, including the\nworst off, thus creating the conditions for a more stable society. But\nwe need then to ask why equal distribution should be treated as the\nbenchmark, departures from which require special justification. When\nRawls says that it is \u2018not reasonable\u2019 for any of the\nparties initially to expect more than an equal share (Rawls 1971, p.\n150; Rawls 1999, p. 130), is this simply a corollary of their position\nas rational choosers behind a veil of ignorance, or has Rawls in\naddition endowed them with a substantive sense of justice that\nincludes this presumption of equality?\n\nAlthough Rawls throughout presents his theory of justice as\ncontractarian, we can now see that the terms of the contract are in\npart determined by prior normative principles that Rawls engineers the\nparties to follow. So in contrast to Gauthier, it is no longer simply\na case of self-interested contractors negotiating their way to an\nagreement. Rawls candidly admits that the contractual situation has to\nbe adjusted so that it yields results that match our pre-existing\nconvictions about justice. But then we may ask how much work the\ncontractual apparatus is really doing (see Barry 1989, ch. 9 for a\ncritical appraisal).\n",
