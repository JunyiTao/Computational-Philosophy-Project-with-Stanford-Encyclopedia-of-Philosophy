    "main_text": "Indian Concepts of Nature || Atomism: The Buddhist and the Jaina Views\n2.2 Atomism: The Buddhist and the Jaina Views\n\nTwo realist schools of Buddhism, the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika and the\nSautr\u0101ntika, also present an atomistic conception of nature.\nAccording to the former, matter is a collocation of the substratum of\ncolour, taste, odour and touch. Atoms are the minutest units of the\nr\u016bpa-skandha (collocation of material elements). As it is\nmentioned in the Abhidharmako\u015ba (I. 44), \u2018Atoms of the\nvisual organ are arranged in the pupil of the eye in the shape of an\naj\u0101j\u012b flower; those of the auditory organ are arranged in\nthe earhole in the shape of a bh\u016brja leaf, atoms of the olfactory\norgan are arranged in the form of a long pin (\u015bal\u0101k\u0101)\ninside the nostrils, those of the gustatory organ inside the mouth in\nthe shape of the half-moon, and those of the cutaneous organ in the\nshape of the body.\u2019 Atoms are thus indirectly related to\nobservational entities. Atoms, according to them, are indivisible,\nimperceptible and momentary. They continually undergo phase-changes.\nSome Sautr\u0101ntikas hold that atoms are not particles of matter but\na dynamic force or energy. According to Vasubandhu, atoms are always\nin an aggregate and never alone. For it has been mentioned by some\nthat the r\u016bpa-skandha is that which can cause obstruction and is\nalso subject to transformation. A single atom cannot possess these\nproperties; hence atoms are always in a cluster.\n\nThe Buddhists then speculate about the nature of the smallest\naggregate. The Sautr\u0101ntikas hold that seven atoms form the\nsmallest aggregate. They also maintain that atoms do not touch one\nanother. So the aggregate of atoms is not a solid whole but rather\nthere is space among atoms. Others, however, concede the possibility\nof dense combination of atoms. The combination of seven atoms takes\nplace in the form of a cluster with one atom at the centre and others\naround it. The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins talk about eight types of\natom. The four fundamental types are of earth (solid), water (fluid),\nfire (hot) and air (moving). The secondary atom types are of colour,\nodour, taste and touch. Thus, according to this view, specific\nqualities are atomic too. Each secondary atom requires for its support\nfour fundamental atoms. So, by simple calculation, a non-sounding\naggregate (a\u015babda) consists of 20 atoms, while a sounding\naggregate (sa\u015babda) is composed of 25 atoms.\n\nThe Jainas also propound atomism. All the entities admitted in their\nontology, except souls and space, are constituted by material elements\n(pudgalas). Atoms are eternal as regards their substance and each\nexists by occupying one space-point (prade\u015ba). These atoms are\nqualitatively similar, each possessing one kind of taste, smell and\ncolour and two kinds of touch, viz. hot or cold and rough or smooth.\nOther kinds of touch, viz. heavy, light, soft and hard, and varied\ncolour, taste and smell are found only in compounds formed by atoms.\nThe Jainas maintain that atoms are usually in motion but not always.\nDepending upon the spatio-temporal conditions, atomic motion is either\nregular (niyamita) or irregular. In one unit of time atoms regularly\nmove in a straight line. However, while in interaction with another\natom or a group of atoms, atomic motion becomes curvilinear. The\nJainas also speculate about the speed of a moving atom under different\nconditions.\n\nThe main difference between these atomisms and\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika atomism lies in their account of\ncombination of atoms. The latter had to resort to God\u2019s will and\nan unseen force (apparently non-natural) to explain this process of\ncombination. The Jainas and the Buddhists, on the other hand, gave a\nsatisfactory account of the combination of atoms in terms of natural\nforces. The Jainas, for example, explain the bonding of atoms on the\nbasis of an empirical observation\n(Tattv\u0101rth\u0101dhigamas\u016btra, 5. 32). It is seen that when\ndrops of water fall on particles of barley, one single lump is formed.\nBy generalization, the claim is that a viscid / smooth (snigdha) atom\ntends to combine with a dry / rough (ruk\u1e63a) atom. Viscidity and\ndryness, smoothness and roughness, are no doubt natural properties of\natoms. The following rules of combination are formulated:\n\nTo combine, atoms must be opposite in nature. According to some\nmodern interpreters, to interact one particle of matter must be\nnegative and the other positive. It has been speculated that the\nJainas arrived at this rule on the basis of observed electrification\nof smooth and rough surfaces on rubbing.\nThe opposing properties of the atoms to be combined must be\nsufficiently strong.\nAtoms endowed with similar properties must differ in\n\u2018intensity\u2019 to combine. The intensity of one must be at\nleast twice strong than the other, i.e., atoms possessing viscidity of\ntwo degrees will combine only with atoms possessing viscidity of four\ndegrees.\nWhile combining, higher degrees transform the lower one. Viscidity\nof four degrees will transform viscidity of two degrees and the\nresultant will be one unit having viscidity of four degrees.\nOtherwise, in combination two will remain separate just like a cloth\nwoven with black and white yarn.\n\n\n\u015aubhagupta (B\u0101hy\u0101rthasiddhik\u0101rik\u0101,\n56\u201358), a later Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, offers an alternative\naccount of the combination of atoms. According to him, two atoms come\nclose to each other because of their inherent potency\n(dravya\u015bakti), though they are not actually conjoined. Like a\nmantra drawing out a snake and keeping it immobile by its inherent\npotency, two atoms are drawn towards each other and form an aggregate\nby their natural inherent potency. The accumulated atoms combine again\nto give rise to varied composite objects of the world. However not all\natoms are equally potent, and some never become a part of an aggregate\nbecause of their insufficient bonding power. Atoms when bonded\ntogether undergo a transformation because of mutual influence and\nnovel properties emerge in the aggregate which were not present in the\nsingle atoms. For example, carbon compounds when transformed into\ndiamonds become too hard to be disintegrated.\n\nThrough theoretical speculation alone, Indian atomists tried to throw\nlight on the nature of the ultimate particles. Some Buddhists, we have\nseen, even described atoms as packets of energy. The chemical laws\nthat the ancient Indians derived on the basis of their speculations\nabout the process of composition of atoms led to the advancement of\napplied chemistry and applied medicine. These theories may not have\nmuch relevance in the context of modern science or cosmology but the\nassociated debates about the nature of causation have contributed to\nan understanding of the philosophical foundations of scientific\nenquiry.\n",
