    "main_text": "Accommodation || Resolving and Accommodating Presuppositions in DRT\n5.3 Resolving and Accommodating Presuppositions in DRT\n\nIn order to account for both presupposition projection facts and the\nparallels between presupposition and anaphora, van der Sandt proposed\nan accommodation-based model as an extension of Discourse\nRepresentation Theory (see the SEP entry on\n discourse representation theory\n for an introduction). Presupposed information is information that is\npresented as given, and in van der Sandt\u2019s theory this means that\npresuppositions want to have discourse referents to bind to. However,\nwhereas anaphoric pronouns are rarely interpretable in the absence of\na suitable antecedent, the same does not hold for all\npresupposition-inducing expressions. For instance, a speaker may\nfelicitously assert that he met \u201cFred\u2019s sister\u201d even if he\nknows full well that his audience isn\u2019t aware that Fred has a sister.\nIn such cases, presuppositions are generally accommodated, which is to\nsay that the hearer accepts the information as given, and revises his\nrepresentation of the context accordingly. Accommodation, thus\nunderstood, is a form of exploitation in Grice\u2019s sense: the purpose of\npresuppositional expressions is to signal that this or that\ninformation is given, and if some information is new but not\nparticularly interesting or controversial (like the fact that somebody\nhas a sister) the speaker may choose to \u201cget it out of the\nway\u201d by presuppositional means.\n\nVan der Sandt\u2019s theory incorporates the notion of accommodation as\nfollows. Presuppositions, according van der Sandt, introduce\ninformation that prefers to be linked to discourse referents that are\nalready available in the hearer\u2019s representation of the discourse, and\nin this respect they are like pronouns. Van der Sandt in fact uses the\nterm \"binding\" to refer to configurations in which presuppositions\nhave antecedents in the Discourse Representation Structure (DRS), thus\ngeneralizing the standard notion of a bound pronoun to cases involving\nmultiple discourse referents. However, if a suitable discourse\nantecedent is not available, a new one will be accommodated, and the\npresupposition is linked to that. Generally speaking, accommodation is\nnot an option in the interpretation of pronouns, and one reason that\nhas been suggested for this is that a pronoun\u2019s descriptive content is\nrelatively poor (see Section 5.1 for discussion). Being told that\n\u201cshe\u201d is wonderful is not particularly helpful if it isn\u2019t\nclear who the pronoun is meant to refer to. By contrast, if the\nspeaker refers to \u201cPedro\u2019s sister\u201d there is more to go on,\nand accommodation becomes feasible. Hence, van der Sandt hypothesizes\nthat pronouns are a special class of presuppositional expressions:\nwhile all presupposition triggers prefer to be linked to antecedents,\npronouns almost always must be linked to antecedents because they are\ndescriptively attenuated, and therefore cannot be construed by way of\naccommodation.\n\nTo get a better idea how this is supposed to work, let us consider an\nexample with several presupposition triggers:\n\n(43)\nIf Fred is protesting, then his son is protesting, too.\n\n\nThis sentence contains the definite NP \u201chis son\u201d, which in\nits turn contains the pronoun \u201chis\u201d, and the focus\nparticle \u201ctoo\u201d. Assuming the pronoun\u2019s antecedent is\n\u201cFred\u201d, the definite NP triggers the presupposition that\nFred has a son, while the focus particle triggers the presupposition\nthat someone other than Fred\u2019s son is protesting. Note that in this\nexample the presupposition triggered by the definite NP is\n\u201cinherited\u201d by the sentence as a whole, while the one\ntriggered by \u201ctoo\u201d is not: normally speaking, an utterance\nof (43) would license the inference that (according to the speaker)\nFred has a son, but not that someone else besides Fred\u2019s son is\nprotesting.\n\nVan der Sandt\u2019s theory accounts for these observations as follows. We\nsuppose that the grammar assigns (43) the intermediate semantic\nrepresentation in (44a). Here [ u1,\u2026, um:\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n] is a simple\nDiscourse Representation Structure in linear form, with u1,\u2026,\num a list of discourse markers, and\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n a list of\nconditions on those markers; connectives like \u21d2 are used to build\nup complex conditions. We assume for convenience that most\ninterpretative problems have been cleared out of the way already, and\nthat the only thing that remains to be done is resolve the\npresuppositions triggered by \u201chis\u201d, \u201chis son\u201d\nand \u201ctoo\u201d, which are flagged by Beaver\u2019s (1992) trigger\nsymbol, \u2202.\n\n(44a)\n[x: Fred(x), [: protesting(x)] \u21d2 [: \u2202[z: \u2202[y:], z\nis y\u2019s son], protesting (z), \u2202[u: u \u2260 z, protesting(u)]]]\n\n\u2026binding y to x\u2026\n(44b)\n[x: Fred(x), [: protesting(x)] \u21d2 [: \u2202[z: z is x\u2019s\nson], protesting(z), \u2202[u: u \u2260 z, protesting(u)]]]\n\n\u2026accommodating x\u2026\n(44c)\n[x, z: Fred(x), z is x\u2019s son, [: protesting(x)] \u21d2 [:\nprotesting(z), \u2202[u: u \u2260 z, protesting(u)]]]\n\n\u2026binding u to x\u2026\n(44d)\n[x, z: Fred(x), z is x\u2019s son, [: protesting(x)] \u21d2 [:\nprotesting(z), x \u2260 z]]\n\n\n(44a) is the initial semantic representation associated with (43), in\nwhich three presuppositions remain to be resolved. The first of these,\ntriggered by the pronoun \u201chis\u201d, is bound to the discourse\nreferent representing Fred, which results in (44b). The second\npresupposition, that Fred has a son, cannot be bound, and therefore\nmust be interpreted by way of accommodation. Van der Sandt\u2019s theory,\nlike Heim\u2019s (Heim, 1983), stipulates that accommodation at the global\nlevel, as shown in (44c), is preferred to accommodation at other\nsites. Finally, the presupposition triggered by the focus particle can\nbe bound in the antecedent of the conditional; after simplification,\nthis results in (44d), which represents the most natural way of\ninterpreting (43).\n",
