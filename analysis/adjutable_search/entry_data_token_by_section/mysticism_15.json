Constructivism\n\nThe approach that opposes both essentialism and perennialism is\n\u201ccontextualism.\u201d Under this approach, all mystical phenomena,\nincluding the mystics\u2019 own understanding of their experiences\nand of what they experienced, must be understood in term of each\nparticular mystic\u2019s culture and era.\n\u201cConstructivists\u201d assert the conceptual\n\u201cconstruction\u201d of mystical experiences by cultural influences\n\u2014 i.e., beliefs, memories, expectations shaped by a mystic\u2019s\ncultural structure the experiences. There are cultural, social,\npsychological, and linguistic influences. Thus, context\npenetrates mystical experiences themselves and not merely the\npost-experiential understanding given by mystics. There is no way to\nseparate mystical experiences completely from their\ninterpretations since our conceptual apparatus shapes our very\nexperience. (See Jones 1909, introduction; Katz 1978\nand 1983; for criticism, see Evans 1989; Forman 1990\nand 1999; Stoeber 1992).\n\n\u201cSoft constructivism\u201d is the view that there are no mystical\nexperiences without at least some structuring from the\nconceptualizations provided by the mystic\u2019s culture. \u201cHard\nconstructivism\u201d is the view that a mystic\u2019s specific\ncultural background completely determines the alleged cognitive content\nof all mystical experiences, not merely shapes or influences an\nindependent experiential element. On the assumption that mystical\ntraditions are widely divergent, hard constructivism entails the\ndenial of both essentialism and perennialism. Soft constructivism\nis consistent with essentialism, however, since it is consistent with\nthere being some transcultural mystical experiences involving\nconceptualizations common across mystical traditions.\n\u201cNonconstructivism\u201d is the view that some or all mystical experiences\nare in fact free of any cultural influence, and the divergence in\nunderstanding their content comes from post-experiential\ninterpretations.\n\nConstructivism is based on prevailing philosophical theories of the\nnature of consciousness. Nonconstructivists, as noted below, can\ninvoke some suggestive work in neuroscience. But the principal\ndifficulty in resolving the issue of constructivism is that we only\nhave mystics\u2019 post-experiential accounts, which all parties agree are\nshaped by a mystic\u2019s culture \u2014 we can never get to the\nexperiences themselves to see if they are constructed or not.\n",
