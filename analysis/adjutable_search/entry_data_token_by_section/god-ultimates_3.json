    "main_text": "Conceptual Foundations and Motivations || Challenges\n1.4 Challenges\n\nThough some model what is ultimate, others object to the entire\nproject of modeling it. There are three main kinds of concerns in the\nliterature: about the existence of ultimacy, about the coherence of\nthe very idea of ultimacy, and about whether talk and knowledge of\nultimacy is humanly possible, even assuming the idea is coherent. The\nfirst concern is motivational: for those who think there is nothing\nultimate, there seems no point worrying about how it has been\nconceived. However, as indicated in\n Section 1.3,\n it is invalid to conclude that there is nothing ultimate without\nhaving some sense of the range of what it might be. So even those who\nthink there is nothing ultimate are thrown into the project of\nmodeling it\u2014at least enough to license the conclusion that this\nwork is not worth doing.\n\nTo offer just one example of the second challenge, Stephen Maitzen\n(2017) argues against the concept of ultimacy on multiple fronts,\nincluding, e.g., that nothing can be metaphysically ultimate in\nSchellenberg\u2019s sense because it would need to be simultaneously\na se and concrete so that it can be metaphysically\nindependent and explain concrete things, respectively. But no\nconcrete thing can explain itself because (to shorten the argument\nconsiderably) even the necessity of such a thing is not identical to\nitself so it is not explaining itself (2017: 53). If Maitzen is right,\nnothing can be metaphysically ultimate in Schellenberg\u2019s sense,\nand thus not metaphysically, axiologically and soteriologically\nultimate at once.\n\nThe third kind of concern is more widespread\u2014that it makes no\nsense for us to model what is ultimate because it is beyond human\nlanguage (ineffable) or beyond human cognitive grasp (cognitively\nunknowable), or both. Why think this? To combine a few common\narguments: what is ultimate (1) goes beyond the world, (2) is in a\nclass by itself, and (3) is infinite, while our predicates are\n(1\u2032) suited to describe things in the world, (2\u2032) classify\nthings with other things, and (3\u2032) are limited (see, e.g.,\nWildman 2013: 770; Seeskin 2013: 794\u2013795). Thus, for any\nP, a statement of the form \u201cultimacy is\nP\u201d seems necessarily false, if it is meaningful at all.\nIneffability and unknowability are related: if we can say nothing true\nabout ultimacy, then we can know nothing about it\u2014at least\nnothing that can be said in words.\n\nThat last hesitation\u2014\u201cat least not in\nwords\u201d\u2014leaves room for, e.g., embodied ways of knowing by\nway of religious, mystical or spiritual experiences which are reported\nin the world\u2019s religious traditions and more generally (whether\nsuch experiences actually happen or not, see, e.g., James 1902\n[1961]). Still, the combined arguments above and the gut intuition\nbehind them represent an enormous challenge to the whole enterprise of\nmodeling what is ultimate in words. There are those who opt\nfor silence in the face of these arguments, and thus understandably\nbut alas \u201cliterally disappear from the conversation\u201d\n(Wildman 2013: 768, \u201calas\u201d because they are missed). One\nmain move of those who do keep talking is to distinguish what is\nultimate as it is in itself, which they concede we can never talk\nabout or know, from it as it affects our experience, which they think\nwe can talk about and know. So some distinguish, e.g., the\nabsolute from the relative Dao (Daodejing, chapter 1); the\nGodhead from God as revealed (Meister Eckhart, e.g., Sermon 97;\nPanikkar 1987 [2005: 2254]); the noumenal from the phenomenal Real (Hick\n1989) etc. and talk or make knowledge claims only about the latter\n(see also, e.g., Paul Hedges 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).[19]\n\nSome also claim to make true statements about what is ultimate by\nrestricting those statements to certain kinds of claims about it. One\ntactic is to talk about how ultimacy is related to us or to other\nparts of the natural (or non-natural) world instead of talking about\nhow it is in itself, i.e., to talk about its extrinsic vs. intrinsic\nproperties. For example, Maimonides suggests that one way to make\n\u201cultimacy is P\u201d true is to make P an\n\u201cattribute of action\u201d, i.e., an \u201caction that he who\nis described has performed, such as Zayd carpentered this\ndoor\u2026\u201d (The Guide of the Perplexed,\nI.52\u20133, italics added), an attribute which says nothing about\nZayd\u2019s intrinsic properties save that he has what it takes to\ncarpenter this door. An analogue of this for ultimacy is, e.g.,\nthe Dao generated being, again an attribute which indicates\nonly that the Dao, whatever it is or is not, can and has generated\nbeing. Other possible ways of speaking truly about ultimacy include\nfamously the via negativa (\u201cGod is not\nP\u201d, Shaffer 2013: 783), the via eminentia\n(\u201cGod is better than P\u201d), the way of analogy\n(\u201cGod is perfectly P\u201d, Copleston 1952: 351 on\nAquinas, e.g., Summa Theologica I, 13 and Summa contra\nGentiles I, 30, see also Kennedy 2013: 158\u2013159), the way of\nsuper-eminence (\u201cGod is beyond P or not\nP\u201d, Pseudo-Dionysius, Shaffer 2013: 786ff)\nand\u2014though this seems doable in theory only\u2014equivocal\npredication (\u201cGod is P*\u201d where P* is a\npredicate outside of human language, Shaffer 2013: 783). What does all\nthis really allow us to say, know, and do philosophically, though?\nMore than one might think, says Neville: though ineffability might\nseem to stop metaphysics, it actually tells us how to do the\nmetaphysics, e.g., \u201cthe dao\u2026can be discussed\nmainly by negations and indirections\u201d (2008: 43), or in these\nother ways.\n",
