    "main_text": "Life || Academic Career\n2.1 Academic Career\n\nHeinrich Scholz was born on December 17, 1884 in Berlin. His father\nwas a Protestant parson (on Scholz\u2019s biography and his work cf.\nElstrodt and Schmitz 2013; Hermes 1958; Meschkowski 1984; Molendijk\n1991; Molendijk 2005; Peckhaus 2008; Ritter, Hermes and Kambartel\n1961; Wernick 1944). He studied Protestant Theology and Philosophy in\nBerlin. Among his teachers were the Prussian Protestant theologian\nAdolf von Harnack (1851\u20131930), the neo-Kantian philosopher Alois\nRiehl (1844\u20131924) and the neo-idealist philosopher Friedrich\nPaulsen (1846\u20131908). In 1911 he completed his\nHabilitation in the Philosophy of Religion and Systematic\nTheology. He obtained an additional doctoral degree in Philosophy at\nthe University of Erlangen in 1913. In 1917 he was appointed to a full\nprofessorship in the Philosophy of Religion and Systematic Theology at\nthe University of Breslau in Silesia, today Wroc\u0142aw, Poland. He\nalso received an honorary doctorate from the Theological Faculty of\nthe University of Berlin. Four years later, in 1921, he was appointed\nto the chair for Philosophy in Kiel, before finally accepting the\noffer of a professorial chair at the University of M\u00fcnster in\n1928. There he first served as professor of Philosophy. He developed a\nclose relationship with Karl Barth, one of the main representatives of\nkerygmatic and dialectic theology, who taught protestant theology in\nM\u00fcnster from 1925 on (cf. Molendijk 1991, ch. 3). Scholz changed\nhis main research area to mathematical logic and foundational\nresearch, and officially taught the subject from 1936 on. In 1943 the\ndenomination of his chair was changed to Mathematical Logic and\nFoundational Research. The institute of this name was founded in\n1950. Scholz retired in 1952. He died in M\u00fcnster on December 30,\n1956.\n",
