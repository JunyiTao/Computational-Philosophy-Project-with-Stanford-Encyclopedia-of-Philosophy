    "main_text": "Mind and Language || Nominalism\n2.3 Nominalism\n\nHobbes is a nominalist: he believes that the only universal things are\nnames (Hobbes 1640, 5.6\u20137; Hobbes 1651, 4.6\u20138; Hobbes\n1655, 2.9). The word \u2018tree\u2019 is, Hobbes thinks, a universal\nor common name that names each of the trees. There is one name, and\nthere are many trees. But there is not, Hobbes argues, some further\nthing that is the universal tree. Nor is there some universal idea\nthat is somehow of each or all of the trees. Rather,\n\u2018tree\u2019 names each of the trees, each of the individuals to\nwhich the term applies (not, note, the collection of them).\n\nWhat Hobbes calls common names, those words which apply to multiple\nthings, are applied because of similarities between those things, not\nbecause of any relation to a universal thing or idea. There are, in\nthe minds of speakers, ideas related to those names, but they are not\nabstract or general ideas, but individual images of individual things.\nI could use \u2018tree\u2019 now, associating it with a tall pine\ntree, and tomorrow use \u2018tree\u2019 but have before my mind a\nshort beech tree. What matters, Hobbes says, is that \u201cwe\nremember that vocal sounds of this kind sometimes evoked one thing in\nthe mind, sometimes something else\u201d (Hobbes 1655, 2.9).\n\nHobbes\u2019s nominalism was recognized by his contemporaries, but\nwas also criticized as going too far. Leibniz put the point as\nfollows.\n\n\nHobbes seems to me to be a super-nominalist. For not content like the\nnominalists, to reduce universals to names, he says that the truth of\nthings itself consists in names and what is more, that it depends on\nthe human will, because truth allegedly depends on the definitions of\nterms, and definitions depend on the human will. This is the opinion\nof a man recognized as among the most profound of our century, and as\nI said, nothing can be more nominalistic than it. Yet it cannot stand.\nIn arithmetic, and in other disciplines as well, truths remain the\nsame even if notations are changed, and it does not matter whether a\ndecimal or a duodecimal number system is used (Leibniz 1670, 128).\n\n\nSimilar worries, that Hobbes\u2019s views could not account for the\nfact that the same truths can be expressed in different languages,\nwere expressed by Descartes in his reply to Hobbes\u2019s objections\nto the Meditations (Descartes 1641a, 2.126) and by Henry More\nin his Immortality of the Soul (More 1659, 133\u20134).\nHobbes would apparently say, given his story about signification, that\n\u201cThis bag is red\u201d has the same signification as\n\u201cDiese Tasche ist rot\u201d. However, he does endorse various\nclaims about aspects of language and truth being conventional and\narbitrary. Some such claims are widely agreed upon: whether we write\nfrom left to right or right to left, for instance, and what particular\nmarks we choose to represent words on paper. But Hobbes also endorses\nother, more controversial, claims of this sort. Most controversially\nperhaps, Hobbes thinks that there is a conventionality and\narbitrariness in the way in which we divide the world up in to kinds.\nThough the application of \u2018red\u2019 to some objects and not\nothers is based on similarities between those objects, the\nsimilarities do not demand that we group exactly those objects\ntogether under a name. That is, the groupings and kinds, though based\nin similarities, are not determined by those similarities alone, but\nalso and primarily by our decisions, which involve awareness of the\nsimilarities, but also an arbitrary element. This introduces an extra\narbitrary element into the truth of \u2018This bag is red\u2019, for\neven if all the underlying similarities had been the same, we might\nhave, say, drawn the line between red and orange in a different place.\nHowever, it\u2019s not at all clear that such arbitrariness gives\nrise to the problematic consequences that Descartes and Leibniz think\nit does (Bolton 1977).\n",
