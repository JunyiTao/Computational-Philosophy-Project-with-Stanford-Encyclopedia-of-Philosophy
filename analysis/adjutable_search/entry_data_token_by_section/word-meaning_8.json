    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language || Grounding and Lexical Competence\n3.2 Grounding and Lexical Competence\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Dummett raised the issue of the proper place of\nlexical meaning in a semantic theory. If the job of a theory of\nmeaning is to make the content of semantic competence\nexplicit\u2014so that one could acquire semantic competence in a\nlanguage L by learning an adequate theory of meaning for\nL\u2014then the theory ought to reflect a competent\nspeaker\u2019s knowledge of circumstances in which she would assert a\nsentence of L, such as \u201cThe horse is in the barn\u201d,\nas distinct from circumstances in which she would assert \u201cThe\ncat is on the mat\u201d. This, in turn, appears to require that the\ntheory yields explicit information about the use of\n\u2018horse\u2019, \u2018barn\u2019, etc., or, in other words,\nthat it includes information which goes beyond the logical type of\nlexical units. Dummett identified such information with a word\u2019s\nFregean sense. However, he did not specify the format in which word\nsenses should be expressed in a semantic theory, except for words that\ncould be defined (e.g., \u2018aunt\u2019 = \u201csister of a\nparent\u201d): in such cases, the definiens specifies what a\nspeaker must understand in order to understand the word (Dummett\n1991). But of course, not all words are of this kind. For other words,\nthe theory should specify what it is for a speaker to know them,\nthough we are not told how exactly this should be done. Similarly,\nGrandy (1974) pointed out that by identifying the meaning of a word\nsuch as \u2018wise\u2019 as a function from possible worlds to the\nsets of wise people in those worlds, Montague semantics only specifies\na formal structure and eludes the question of whether there is some\npossible description for the functions which are claimed to be the\nmeanings of words. Lacking such descriptions, possible worlds\nsemantics is not really a theory of meaning but a theory of logical\nform or logical validity. Again, aside from suggesting that \u201cone\nwould like the functions to be given in terms of computation\nprocedures, in some sense\u201d, Grandy had little to say about the\nform of lexical descriptions.\n\nIn a similar vein, Partee (1981) argued that Montague semantics, like\nevery compositional or structural semantics, does not\nuniquely fix the intensional interpretation of words. The addition of\nmeaning postulates does rule out some interpretations (e.g.,\ninterpretations on which the extension of \u2018bachelor\u2019 and\nthe extension of \u2018married\u2019 may intersect in some possible\nworld). However, it does not reduce them to the unique,\n\u201cintended\u201d or, in Montague\u2019s words,\n\u201cactual\u201d interpretation (Montague 1974). Hence, standard\nmodel-theoretic semantics does not capture the whole content of a\nspeaker\u2019s semantic competence, but only its structural aspects.\nFixing \u201cthe actual interpretation function\u201d requires more\nthan language-to-language connections as encoded by, e.g., meaning\npostulates: it requires some \u201clanguage-to-world\ngrounding\u201d. Arguments to the same effect were developed\nby Bonomi (1983) and Harnad (1990). In particular, Harnad had in mind\nthe simulation of human semantic competence in artificial systems: he\nsuggested that symbol grounding could be implemented, in part, by\n\u201cfeature detectors\u201d picking out \u201cinvariant features\nof objects and event categories from their sensory projections\u201d\n(for recent developments see, e.g., Steels & Hild 2012). Such a\ncognitively oriented conception of grounding differs from\nPartee\u2019s Putnam-inspired view, on which the semantic grounding\nof lexical items depends on the speakers\u2019 objective interactions\nwith the external world in addition to their narrow psychological\nproperties.\n\nA resolutely cognitive approach characterizes Marconi\u2019s (1997)\naccount of lexical semantic competence. In his view, lexical\ncompetence has two aspects: an inferential aspect, underlying\nperformances such as semantically based inference and the command of\nsynonymy, hyponymy and other semantic relations; and a\nreferential aspect, which is in charge of performances such\nas naming (e.g., calling a horse \u2018horse\u2019) and application\n(e.g., answering the question \u201cAre there any spoons in the\ndrawer?\u201d). Language users typically possess both aspects of\nlexical competence, though in different degrees for different words: a\nzoologist\u2019s inferential competence on \u2018manatee\u2019 is\nusually richer than a layman\u2019s, though a layman who spent her\nlife among manatees may be more competent, referentially, than a\n\u201cbookish\u201d scientist. However, the two aspects are\nindependent of each another, and neuropsychological evidence appears\nto show that they can be dissociated: there are patients whose\nreferential competence is impaired or lost while their inferential\ncompetence is intact, and vice versa (see\n Section 5.3).\n Being a theory of individual competence, Marconi\u2019s account does\nnot deal directly with lexical meanings in a public language:\ncommunication depends both on the uniformity of cognitive interactions\nwith the external world and on communal norms concerning the use of\nlanguage, together with speakers\u2019 deferential attitude toward\nsemantic authorities.\n",
