    "main_text": "From Languages of Art to Reconceptions: New Looks at Aesthetic Issues || Artistic Style\n4.5 Artistic Style\n\nGoodman\u2019s account of style is a good example of a Goodmanian\n\u201creconception\u201d: the philosophical approach to the issue\nmust not only abandon the characterization of style as related to form\nand hence contrasted to content (for, after all, that an author\nwrites, say, of social issues rather than battles should count as an\naspect of the author\u2019s style), but must, most importantly,\nrecognize the role that classifications in terms of style have in\nunderstanding and appreciating a work. \n\nGoodman invites us to recognize elements of style in a work\u2019s\ncontent, in its form, and in the feelings\nit expresses. His proposal is that the stylistic features of a work\nmake up a subset of the features \u201cof what is said, of what is\nexemplified, or of what is expressed\u201d (Goodman 1978a, 32). In\nparticular, stylistic features are those symbolic properties of a work\nthat allow us to place the work in a certain place, time period, and\nartist\u2019s oeuvre. That is, style properties help in answering\nquestions as \u201cwhere?\u201d, \u201cwhen?\u201d,\n\u201cwho?\u201d with respect to a work\u2014they function,\nmetaphorically, as a signature for a work: \u201cstyle\nconsists of those features of the symbolic functioning of a work that\nare characteristic of author, period, place, or school\u201d (1978a,\n35). Given what Goodman has said, when discussing the issue of\nauthenticity, regarding the aesthetic importance of historical\nproperties of a painting, knowing the style of an artwork is\naesthetically relevant, since \u201cknowledge of the origin of a work\n[\u2026] informs the way the work is to be looked at or listened to\nor read, providing a basis for the discovery of nonobvious ways the\nwork differs from and resembles other works\u201d (1978a, 38). It is\nin virtue of stylistic properties\u2019 link to the symbolic\nfunctions of a work of art that identifying a work\u2019s style,\nespecially when complex and challenging and even difficult to\nidentify, is integral to \u201cthe understanding of works of art and\nthe worlds they present\u201d (1978a, 40).\n",
