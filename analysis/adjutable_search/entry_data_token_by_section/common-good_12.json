The Common Good in Politics: Democracy and Collective Decision-Making\n\nIn the vast literature on the common good, several topics stand out as\nimportant subjects of concern. One important topic is democracy.\nDemocracy figures prominently in philosophical reflection about the\ncommon good because there is broad agreement among\nphilosophers\u2014though by no means universal agreement!\u2014that\na private society would be defective in terms of the way that members\nmake collective decisions. Collective decision-making in a political\ncommunity must unfold in its public life, that is, in the sphere of\ninteraction in which citizens transcend their own private concerns and\nreason from the standpoint of the common good.\n\nOn some accounts of democracy, citizens are not required to take up\nthe perspective of the common good. According to pluralism, for\nexample, democracy is best understood as a collective decision-making\nprocess that disperses power and influence among many different groups\nin society (see Dahl 1956 and 1989). Citizens each have their own\nprivate interests and groups of citizens with similar interests\nadvance these interests in various rule-making forums. The overall\nprocess is essentially a form of bargaining, where each group\nstrategically trades concessions with other groups in order to\nmaximize the satisfaction of their policy preferences. A properly\nordered democratic regime will maintain fair bargaining conditions,\nwhere all important groups are able to exercise a meaningful degree of\ninfluence on the collective decisions that affect their interests. But\non the pluralist view no one needs to take an interest in the common\naffairs of the community: each citizen may care only about her own\nprivate affairs, entering the public forum to advance her private\ninterests against the interests of others.\n\nMany philosophers criticize pluralism and other similarly privatized\nviews of democratic reasoning because these views fail to capture an\nimportant aspect of political life. As Jeremy Waldron notes, citizens\noften vote on the basis of something other than their own private\ninterests:\n\n\nPeople often vote on the basis of what they think is the general good\nof society. They are concerned about the deficit, or about abortion,\nor about Eastern Europe, in a way that reflects nothing more about\ntheir own personal interests than that they have a stake in the\nissues. Similarly, the way they vote will usually take into account\ntheir conception of the special importance of certain interests and\nliberties. (Waldron 1990 [1993: 408])\n\n\nMany critics also contend that pluralism does not distinguish properly\nbetween the form of practical reasoning appropriate to democratic\ndecision-making and the form that is appropriate in market contexts.\nManagers in a firm may justify one business strategy over another on\nthe grounds that this strategy will improve the bottom line for the\nfirm, taking no account of how the strategy might harm competitors or\nother groups. But citizens in a democratic process are not supposed to\nreason this way:\n\n\n\u2026it is a political convention of a democratic society to appeal\nto the common interest. No political party publicly admits to pressing\nfor legislation to the disadvantage of any recognized social group.\n(Rawls 1971 [1999: 280])\n\n\nIf a privatized approach to democratic decision-making is morally\ndefective, what exactly is the problem? What is wrong with citizens\nassessing laws and voting on laws based on how well these will serve\ntheir private interests?\n\nOne prominent line of reasoning in democratic theory appeals to an epistemic\nconception of democracy (e.g., Rousseau 1762b; J. Cohen 1986).\nAccording to this view, there is an independent standard of\ncorrectness for legislation, which says that laws must serve common\ninterests. Democratic decision-making is a requirement of political\nmorality because the legislative process is more likely to generate\nlaws that meet the standard when the process is democratic. Moreover,\na democratic process is more likely to generate laws that meet the\nstandard when those taking part in the process are actually trying to\nidentify laws that meet the standard. So citizens taking part in the\ndemocratic process should assess legislative proposals in terms of how\nwell these proposals serve common interests because this is the\nbest way to identify and enact laws that are justified.\n\nThe other main line of reasoning in democratic theory appeals to a\ndeliberative conception of democracy (J. Cohen 1996, 2009;\nHabermas 1992; Gutman & Thompson 1996). According to Joshua\nCohen\u2019s deliberative conception, political morality requires\ncitizens to make binding collective decisions through a process of\npublic reasoning in which citizens recognize one another as equal\nmembers of the political community (J. Cohen 1989, 1996). The process\nof public reasoning requires that each citizen should offer reasons to\nconvince others to adopt a legislative proposal, where these reasons\nare reasons that she could properly expect others to accept, given the\nfacts of reasonable pluralism.\n\nCohen argues that the ideal of deliberative democracy, as he\nunderstands it, provides a compelling account of the common good\norientation of democratic decision-making (1996 [2009:\n168\u2013170]). No citizen could reasonably expect others to accept a\nlegislative proposal simply because it serves her own interests, so\nthere is a basic requirement that any legislative proposal must be\nresponsive to the interests of all citizens. Furthermore, the\nbackground idea that citizens are equal members of the political\ncommunity imposes an additional requirement. Citizens \n\n\ncan reject, as a reason within [the] process, that some are worth less\nthan others or that the interests of one group are to count less than\nthe interests of other groups. (1996 [2009: 169]) \n\n\nThis constraint on acceptable reasons leads to a substantive\nrequirement that legislation must be consistent with a public\nunderstanding of the common good that treats people as equals in the\nrelevant sense.\n\nCohen cites Rawls\u2019s difference principle as one example of a\npublic understanding of the common good that satisfies the relevant\nrequirement.\n\n\nTreating equality as a baseline, [the difference principle] requires\nthat inequalities established or sanctioned by state action must work\nto the maximal advantage of the least advantaged. That baseline [i.e.,\nequality] is a natural expression of the constraints on reasons that\nemerge from the background equal standing of citizens: it will not\ncount as a reason for a system of policy that that system benefits the\nmembers of a particular group singled out by social class or native\ntalent or any other feature that distinguishes among equal citizens.\n[\u2026In addition, the principle] insists, roughly speaking, that\nno one be left less well off than anyone needs to be\u2014which is\nitself a natural expression of the deliberative conception. (J. Cohen\n1996 [2009: 169\u2013170])\n\n\nNote that Cohen argues here for a \u201cdistributive\u201d rather \nthan a \u201ccommunal\u201d\nconception of the common good (see\n section 7\n above). On Cohen\u2019s view, members of a political community have a\nrelational obligation to provide one another with a set of facilities\nthat answers to everyone\u2019s sectional interests in the way that a\ncertain distributive principle prescribes (i.e. the difference\nprinciple). This differs from a communal conception, which does not\nconceive of the relational obligation of citizens in terms of a\ndistributive principle.\n\nCohen is probably right that the difference principle is a natural\nexpression of the deliberative ideal against the background of an\nassumption that all citizens are equal members of the political\ncommunity. But defenders of a communal conception might argue that the\npolitical relationship among citizens has a social dimension that goes\nbeyond equal membership in the political community. Like the\nrelationship among friends or among members of a sports team, the\npolitical relationship must be understood to impose obligations on\npeople that embody relational ideals such as solidarity and\nmutuality. This means that the political relationship may require\ncitizens to reason with each other in ways that embody these\nvalues. For instance, the political relationship may require citizens\nto set their private and sectional interests aside in certain\ndeliberative contexts in order to focus on their common interests as\ncitizens. An implicit concern for social ideals such as solidarity and\nmutuality may be one reason why Rawls identifies the common good with\nthe principle of common interest and gives this principle a special\nrole to play in political reasoning.\n",
