    "main_text": "Response to Disagreement vs. Subsequent Level of Confidence\n3. Response to Disagreement vs. Subsequent Level of Confidence\n\n\nA person can start out with a belief that is irrational, obtain some\nnew relevant evidence concerning that belief, respond to that new\nevidence in a completely reasonable way, and yet end up with an\nirrational belief. This fact is particularly important when it comes\nto posing the central questions regarding the epistemology of\ndisagreement (Christensen 2011).\n\n\nSuppose Bub\u2019s belief that Japan is a totalitarian state, belief\n\\(J\\), is based on a poor reading of the evidence and a raging,\nirrational bias that rules his views on this topic. He has let his\nbias ruin his thinking through his evidence properly.\n\n\nThen he gets some new information: some Japanese police have been\ncaught on film beating government protesters. After hearing this, Bub\nretains his old confidence level in \\(J\\).\n\n\nWe take it that when Bub learns about the police, he has not acquired\nsome new information that should make him think \u2018Wait a minute;\nmaybe I\u2019m wrong about Japan\u2019. He shouldn\u2019t lose\nconfidence in his belief \\(J\\) merely because he learned some facts\nthat do not cast any doubt on his belief!\n\n\nThe lesson of this story is this: Bub\u2019s action of\nmaintaining his confidence in his belief as a result of his new\nknowledge is reasonable even though his retained belief itself is\nunreasonable. Bub\u2019s assessment of the original\nevidence concerning \\(J\\) was irrational, but his reaction to the\nnew information was rational; his subsequent belief in \\(J\\)\nwas (still) irrational (because although the video gives a little\nsupport to \\(J\\), it\u2019s not much). The question, \u2018Is Bub\nbeing rational after he got his new knowledge?\u2019 has two\nreasonable interpretations: \u2018Is his retained belief in \\(J\\)\nrational after his acquisition of the new knowledge?\u2019\nvs. \u2018Is his response to the new knowledge rational?\u2019\n\n\nOn the one hand, \u201crationality demands\u201d that upon his\nacquisition of new knowledge Bub drop his belief \\(J\\) that Japan is a\ntotalitarian state: after all, his overall evidence for it is very\nweak. On the other hand, \u201crationality demands\u201d that upon\nhis acquisition of new knowledge Bub keep his belief \\(J\\) given\nthat that acquisition\u2014which is the only thing that\u2019s\nhappened to him\u2014gives him no reason to doubt \\(J\\). This\nsituation still might strike you as odd. After all, we\u2019re saying\nthat Bub is being rational in keeping an irrational belief! But no:\nthat\u2019s not what we\u2019re saying. The statement \u2018Bub is\nbeing rational\u2019 is ambiguous: is it saying that Bub\u2019s\nretained belief \\(J\\) is rational or is it saying that Bub\u2019s\nretaining of that belief was rational? The statement can take on\neither meaning, and the two meanings end up with different verdicts:\nthe retained belief is irrational but the retaining\nof the belief is rational. In the first case, a state is being\nevaluated, in the second, an action is being evaluated.\n\n\nConsider a more mundane case. Jack hears a bump in the night and\nirrationally thinks there is an intruder in his house (he has long had\nthree cats and two dogs, so he should know by now that bumps are\nusually caused by his pets; further, he has been a house owner long\nenough to know full well that old houses like his make all sorts of\nodd noises at night, pets or no). Jack has irrational belief \\(B\\):\nthere is an intruder upstairs or there is an intruder downstairs. Then\nafter searching upstairs he learns that there is no intruder upstairs.\nClearly, the reasonable thing for him to do is infer that there is an\nintruder downstairs\u2014that\u2019s the epistemically reasonable\ncognitive move to make in response to the new information,\ngiven\u2014despite the fact that the new belief \u2018There is an\nintruder downstairs\u2019 is irrational in an evidential sense.\n\n\nThese two stories show that one\u2019s action of retaining\none\u2019s belief\u2014that intellectual action\u2014can be\nepistemically fine even though the retained belief is not. And, more\nimportantly, we have to distinguish two questions about the\nacquisition of new information (which need not have anything at all to\ndo with disagreement):\n\nAfter you acquire some new information relevant to a certain\nbelief \\(B\\) of yours, what should your new level of confidence in\n\\(B\\) be in order for your new level of confidence regarding\n\\(B\\) to be rational?\nAfter you acquire some new information relevant to a certain belief\n\\(B\\) of yours, what should your new level of confidence in \\(B\\) be\nin order for your response to the new information to be\nrational?\n\n\n\nThe latter question concerns an intellectual action (an\nintellectual response to the acquisition of new information), whereas\nthe former question concerns the subsequent level of\nconfidence itself, the new confidence level you end up with,\nwhich comes about partially as a causal result of the intellectual\naction. As we have seen with the Japan and intruder stories the\nepistemic reasonableness of the one is partially independent of that\nof the other.\n",
