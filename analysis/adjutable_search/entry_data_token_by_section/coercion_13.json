    "main_text": "Uses for thought about coercion || Coercion, freedom, and voluntariness\n3.3 Coercion, freedom, and voluntariness\n\nSome choices are said to be made freely, others unfreely, or\ninvoluntarily. More generally, people may be said to live more freely\nor less freely, depending on facts such as the range and quality of\nchoices open to them, the extent to which they are immune to\ninterference from outside powerful parties, or the extent to which\nthey can pursue options of deep significance to them.\nAutonomy seems to be a special type of freedom which, insofar\nas it differs from the above types, is used to refer to an inner state\nof orderly self-directedness. Coercion has been thought to be inimical\nto at least some of these types of freedom, perhaps all, and also to\nhave deleterious impacts on the special type we call autonomy.\n\nIf coercion includes uses of direct force against a person\u2019s\nbody, it is clear enough how it can constrain most kinds of freedom\n(though not necessarily how it can affect autonomy). But as Aquinas\nlong ago noted, it\u2019s unclear why coercion in the form of threats\nshould be thought to be in tension with freedom. As Craig Carr puts\nthe worry, \u201cif at least some instances of coercion involve\nmaking choices, and if being able to make one\u2019s own choices is\npart of what it means to be free, in what sense (if any) is coercion\nantithetical to freedom?\u201d (Carr 1988, 59). Certainly many\ninstances of coercion make one\u2019s choices less appealing than\nthey would be otherwise, or reduce the quality of the compossible\noptions one has available. But it does sound somewhat odd to say that\none is less free just because one\u2019s choices have become less\nappealing, or some options for action have fallen off the menu of\nchoices. Is there a sense we can give to the claim that one is less\nfree because of coercion?\n\nLet us consider first a type of freedom associated with the range and\nquality of actions open to a person. One gets an intuitive idea of\nthis sort of freedom in comparing the situation of a prison inmate to\nthat of someone outside prison. Someone confined to a cell around the\nclock has less freedom than does someone who is able to move about as\nshe wills, interact with others in a variety of ways, and choose from\na broad variety of activities (at least if she has available\nsufficient means to pursue them). We might be tempted to say that the\nunincarcerated person has more and better choices of\nactions. But several difficulties get in the way of making such a\ncomparison precise. We lack a precise way to enumerate actions, which\nseems necessary if we are to count them or compare their number. The\nincarcerated and unincarcerated both have indeterminately many\ndifferent things they can do, each can do only perform some small\nrange of those actions at any one time. (It\u2019s even likely that\nthe incarcerated person can do some things the unincarcerated person\n can\u2019t.[24])\n So it is probably more helpful to focus on the greater quality and\ndesirability of the actions open to the unincarcerated person. Being\nconfined to a jail cell takes away one\u2019s freedom at least in\npart because it denies one the necessary means to pursue many other\nactivities that would ordinarily be desirable. But we also have no\ngood means for reckoning the value of different actions\ninterpersonally. So even this comparison is hard to make in a robust,\ndefensible\n fashion.[25]\n\nWith some threats, it seems an interpersonal comparison is\nunnecessary. When the gunman demands one\u2019s money or one\u2019s\nlife, one goes from being able to have both to being unable to have\nboth. What were compossible goods have now become incompossible, and a\nvaluable option (e.g., keeping one\u2019s money) has become\nessentially foreclosed. So freedom is decreased (Day 1977, 259).\n\nFocusing locally on the coercee\u2019s situation, such analysis seems\nreasonable enough. However, it is possible that some general threats,\nmade against a group of people, may make the individuals in the group\nmore rather than less free. Consider the threats that are part of laws\nagainst stealing. The state may threaten to jail those who steal,\nwhich (let us assume) makes it incompossible both to steal and to\nretain one\u2019s freedom. The possibility of a stable system of\nprivate property, however, would seem to depend on the existence of\nsuch laws which prohibit the wanton expropriation of the goods of\nothers. If such a regime is in fact valuable, then the threat to\nincarcerate thieves may both reduce people\u2019s freedom with\nrespect to one sort of action (by making stealing incompossible with\nremaining unincarcerated), while enhancing it with respect to others\n(by making it possible to accumulate, use, and trade private\nproperty). For another example, notice that the ability to make\nenforceable contracts with others greatly enhances one\u2019s\nabilities to gain through cooperation, but that it relies precisely on\nthe fact that contracting parties give up certain seemingly\ncompossible benefits (say, gaining the goods of another while failing\nto fulfill one\u2019s half of the bargain).\n\nCraig Carr suggests that we can grapple with the complexities here by\nnoticing that many social interactions are regulated by conventions\nthat arise from particular sorts of interpersonal relationships. So,\nfor instance, a sports team is managed by a coach, who may\n\u201cthreaten\u201d to pull a player out of the game unless he\nsticks to the game plan. But this threat does not, we may agree,\nlessen the player\u2019s freedom in any interesting sense (Carr 1988,\n62). Given the nature of sports, the roles of players and coaches, and\nthe necessity of organization in making the team and sport possible,\nCarr suggests that when such threats are licensed by the appropriate\nconventions, then there is no reason to suppose that they impinge on\nfreedom. It may be difficult in many cases to decide just what\nconventions are appropriate and controlling in a situation, but it\nseems reasonable to suppose that something like Carr\u2019s analysis\nis helpful in understanding the relationship between threats and\nfreedom in conventional contexts.\n\nSerena Olsaretti argues for the importance of a distinction between\nacting freely and acting voluntarily, and holds that while\n(successful) coercion may not in fact affect a coercee\u2019s freedom\n(if, say, a coercer is bluffing), it always affects their potential to\nact voluntarily. On her analysis, the extent of a person\u2019s\nfreedom is determined by their actual possibilities for\naction, while whether they act voluntarily depends on whether\nthe agent\u2019s actual action is acceptable to the agent. \u201cA\nchoice is voluntary if and only if it is not made because there is no\nacceptable alternative to it. Conversely, a claim that a person was\nforced to do x (she did x non-voluntarily) means that she did x\nbecause she had no acceptable alternative to it\u201d (Olsaretti\n2004, 139). Because credible threats make alternatives to the\ncoercer\u2019s desired activity unacceptable to the coercee, they\nvitiate the voluntariness of the coercee\u2019s acquiescence, and\namount to \u201cforcing\u201d the coercee to act as they do. Seeing\nsuch choices as forced whether or not unfree, Olsaretti argues, shows\nimportant similarities between coerced choices and other situations in\nwhich people\u2019s choices are forced, such as in certain market\nconditions.\n\nThere\u2019s a different way of thinking about freedom that is\npolitical in nature. This is the way of thinking that some (e.g.,\nPettit 1996) have associated with civic republicanism, in which\nfreedom amounts to being undominated by another agent. One is\ndominated by another if it is continually possible for another party\nto step in and impose his will on one\u2019s choices (even if the\ndominant party rarely finds it useful to do so). Freedom from\ndomination differs from the previous sort in that one who is subject\nto the domination of another may in fact have a wide variety of\nvaluable choices open to her. The sense in which she is unfree is that\nher choices must always be made with an eye towards retaining the\nfavor of those in a position to interfere with her choices.\nConversely, one may be undominated by anyone else, yet lack (for\nvarious reasons) many of the different valuable options that might be\navailable to some who are highly subject to the power of others (e.g.,\nadolescent children of wealthy parents, or prisoners in\nminimum-security facilities).\n\nGarnett\u2019s \u201ceudaimonistic\u201d understanding of coercion\nfollows this line, holding that \u201cwhat matters fundamentally for\ncoercion is whether, in acting, one\u2019s will is subject to,\ndetermined by, or under the control of the will of another, and not\nwhether one\u2019s prospective actions are blocked by the actions of\nanother\u201d (Garnett 2018, 554). He contrasts this understanding of\n\u201cfreedom-as-nonsubjection\u201d to\n\u201cfreedom-as-nonprevention,\u201d holding that there is a\ndistinct good that involves not being subjected to interference by\nothers, independently of whether this amounts to domination. Notably,\nGarnett holds that such subjection can be found in some cases of\noffers, where the offeror takes advantage of the offeree\u2019s lack\nof an acceptable alternative.\n\nCoercion is one method by which a powerful agent can exercise and\nmaintain his dominance over another. When one has the power needed to\ncredibly threaten another, one can use that power to impose\none\u2019s will on her regarding many choices (Anderson 2010). This\npower may give one the ability to dominate another in Pettit\u2019s\nsense, since it can be used arbitrarily to alter or constrain\nanother\u2019s activities, even if it is in fact used only rarely. If\none\u2019s threats are sufficiently credible, and if meeting\none\u2019s demands is not devastating in itself, one may be able to\nleverage one\u2019s powers to influence many of the activities of\nothers, while only rarely being required to expend one\u2019s powers\nin enforcement. Malignant governments and mafias are frequently able\nto maintain control over sizeable populations through threats and\nintimidation, though they may only infrequently interfere directly in\nthe activities of others. If one\u2019s powers and wishes are well\nenough known through past demonstrations, one may even be able to\navoid making many overt threats while still getting one\u2019s\nway.\n\nThis raises a question about whether the use of coercion requires or\nimplies that the coercer is in a position of dominance over the\ncoercee. While most would likely accept that one can coerce without\nhaving such dominance, this may be a rarer and more curious scenario\nthan it at first appears. It is true that virtually anyone can state a\nclaim that has the form of a threat against another, and it is also\ntrue that many agents can issue credible threats that are nonetheless\nbluffs \u2014 that is, can threaten without possessing the power that\nis advertised. Nonetheless, the possibility and usefulness of issuing\nthreats depends in general on the likelihood that such threats can be\nexecuted successfully, without the coercer suffering a cost comparable\nto that of the coercee. Also, it would seem that for coercion to be\npossible, one must be in a position to do more than trivial damage to\nthe coercee\u2019s interests; otherwise, one might be said to use\ncoercion when one threatens, e.g., to quit one\u2019s minimum-wage\nfast-food job if one\u2019s employer doesn\u2019t raise one\u2019s\nwage to match what one could make at the restaurant across the street.\nMoreover, coercers frequently need to craft and adapt their threats to\nthe specific vulnerabilities of the coercee. Gideon Yaffe has nicely\nexpressed this aspect of the relationship between the coercer\u2019s\npower and their ability to affect one\u2019s freedom:\n\nThe key to the explanation for the freedom-undermining force of\ncoercion is that, as a general rule, coercers don\u2019t merely\nproduce, but also track, the compliance of their victims. \u2026\n[T]he coercer is rarely attached to the particular nasty consequence\nthat he threatens; with some limits, he is ready to bring about\nwhatever consequences would serve to bring the victim around to\ncompliance (Yaffe 2003).\n\n\nIf a coercer lacks the power needed to do these things, it may be\nirrational for the coercer to execute his threat if defied, and hence\nfrequently irrational for the coercee to accede to it. So unless the\ncoercer or coercee is irrational (and the other perceives him as\nsuch), or unless one is deceived about the other\u2019s relative\npower (or rationality), coercion requires some significant\ndifferential in power between coercer and coercee for it, in general,\nto be a rational, useful technique. So even if a just state does not\ndominate its citizens in Pettit\u2019s sense of exercising its power\nover them arbitrarily, it still must be capable of such dominance if\nit is to be able to keep order against those who would otherwise defy\nits commands. (For related arguments and an analysis of domination as\nthe \u201cimpositional power\u201d to impose one\u2019s will\narbitrarily on another, see McCammon 2015.)\n",
