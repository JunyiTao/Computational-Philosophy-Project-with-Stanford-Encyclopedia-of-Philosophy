Life and Works\n\nRamsey was born in Cambridge on 22 February 1903. His father was a\nmathematician and Fellow of Magdalene College whilst his mother\ncampaigned for women\u2019s suffrage and other social causes. In 1920\nRamsey matriculated as an undergraduate student at Trinity College,\nCambridge, from which he graduated in 1923 with a First in\nMathematics. The year before he matriculated, whilst still a 17 year\nold school boy, Ramsey became friends, through his father\u2019s\nconnections, with C.K. Ogden and I.A. Richards, also a Fellow of\nMagdalene. Ramsey had already read Russell\u2019s Introduction to\nMathematical Philosophy and G.E. Moore\u2019s Ethics\nbut because he had become interested in learning German, Ogden gave\nRamsey Mach\u2019s Die Analyse der Empfindungen\n[Analysis of Sensations] to read. Ramsey, still in his final\nschool year, went on to read Louis Couturat, Henri Poincar\u00e9 and\nHermann Weyl. By 1921, Ogden had become so impressed by Ramsey\u2019s\nphilosophical acumen and facility with German that he commissioned\nRamsey, as a second year undergraduate, to translate\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus into English \u2013 in the\nface of Moore\u2019s scepticism that the Tractatus could be\ntranslated into English at all. Back in 1920, Ramsey also discussed\nwith Ogden and Richards their theory of thought and language, later\nfamously elaborated in The Meaning of Meaning (1923), which\nRamsey reviewed \u2013 unfavourably \u2013 in Mind (1924).\nRamsey nonetheless praised \u201cthe excellent appendix on C.S.\nPeirce\u201d and this lead him to study the volume of Peirce\u2019s\npapers, Chance, Love and Logic (1923), which Ogden had just\npublished in his book series for Kegan Paul. During Ramsey\u2019s\nfirst year as an undergraduate, Ogden also arranged for him to meet\nRussell in London and encouraged Ramsey to attend Moore\u2019s\nlectures with him and Richards; Ramsey duly went along in his second\nterm to Moore\u2019s lectures on \u201cIncomplete Symbols and\nLogical Constructions\u201d. Moore was later to recall \u201cIn the\nearly twenties F.P. Ramsey attended at least one course of my\nlectures. I had soon come to feel of him, as of Wittgenstein, that he\nwas much cleverer than I was\u201d (1944, 35).\n\nIn his first year as an undergraduate, Ramsey had met and befriended\nR.B. Braithwaite, then a mathematics undergraduate a year ahead of\nhim. Braithwaite introduced Ramsey to J.M. Keynes, the economist.\nRamsey was soon after elected to the Cambridge Apostles, the secret\ndebating society of which Braithwaite and Keynes were both active\nmembers. Ramsey attended Keynes\u2019 economics lectures and they\ndiscussed Keynes\u2019 Treatise on Probability (1921).\nRamsey\u2019s criticisms appeared the following year in a review of\nKeynes\u2019 book for Ogden\u2019s journal, The Cambridge\nMagazine (1922); Keynes had maintained that probability is an\nobjective relation between propositions but Ramsey denied we perceive\nsuch relations nor grasp them intellectually. After his finals, Ramsey\nturned to writing a critical notice for Mind of\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus (1923). Ogden had written to\nWittgenstein suggesting that he meet with Ramsey and Ramsey duly went\nto Puchberg, near Vienna, in September 1923 to spend a fortnight with\nWittgenstein working through the Tractatus with him. In 1924\nRamsey spent 6 months in Vienna being psychoanalysed, during which\ntime he met Moritz Schlick and Hans Hahn, both members of the Vienna\nCircle. He returned to Cambridge in October 1924 where he had been\nappointed as a Fellow In Mathematics at King\u2019s College, where\nKeynes, also a Fellow, had pushed for Ramsey\u2019s appointment. At a\nmeeting of the Moral Sciences Club that December, Ramsey met his\nfuture wife, Lettice Baker; they married in 1925 and had two daughters\ntogether.\n\nOnce back in Cambridge, Ramsey settled down to teach, including a\ncourse on the foundations of mathematics, and to write the papers in\nphilosophy, economics and mathematics for which he was to become\nfamous. He started by completing \u201cThe Foundations of\nMathematics\u201d, which he had begun in Vienna, and\n\u201cUniversals\u201d, both published in 1925. The former was\nintended to rescue logicism by remedying the defects Ramsey found in\nPrincipia Mathematica, whilst the latter was a development of\nthe programme of logical analysis advertised in the\nTractatus; they won Ramsey immediate \u00e9clat. But it was\nthe following year in which Ramsey really struck out on his own,\nwriting \u201cTruth and Probability\u201d (1926a) although he did\nnot publish it, which started from Ramsey\u2019s criticisms of Keynes\nand provides a subjective theory of probability and a pragmatic view\nof induction, and \u201cFacts and Propositions\u201d (1927a),\ninitially inspired by his reading of Peirce and Russell\u2019s\nAnalysis of Mind (1921), in which Ramsey\u2019s philosophy\nof mind and language began to have, as he put it, a distinctive\n\u2018pragmatist tendency\u2019 (1927a, 170). It was also the year\nthat Ramsey began dedicated work on economics which resulted in the\nfirst of his seminal papers on economics, \u2018A contribution to the\ntheory of taxation\u2019 (1927b), later followed by his\n\u2018Mathematical Theory of Saving\u2019 (1928a). Ramsey also wrote\nhis influential paper, \u2018On a Problem of Formal Logic\u2019\n(1930), which contains the mathematical results now called\n\u2018Ramsey\u2019s Theorems\u2019. In 1927 Ramsey also began work\non a book manuscript, On Truth ([OT]). During the last two\nyears of his life, Ramsey wrote a number of philosophical notes and\npapers, including \u2018Theories\u2019 and \u2018General\nPropositions and Causality\u2019, both completed in 1929. They were\npublished by Braithwaite (in [FM]), along with \u2018Truth and\nProbability\u2019, in a posthumous volume of Ramsey\u2019s papers,\nThe Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays,\nwhilst the manuscript on truth did not appear until 1991.\n\nAfter meeting and falling out with Ramsey when visiting Keynes in\n1925, Wittgenstein returned to settle in Cambridge in 1929. He was\nadmitted as a Ph.D. student, submitting the Tractatus as his\nthesis, Ramsey was his supervisor; they met regularly during what was\nto be the last year of Ramsey\u2019s life. Wittgenstein was later to\nrecall the significance of these conversations for his own\nintellectual development in the preface to Philosophical\nInvestigations. Ramsey fell ill at the end of November 1929 and\nwas diagnosed with jaundice. He had been corresponding with Schlick\nand had promised to write a review of Rudolf Carnap\u2019s\nAufbau. He died on 19 January 1930 in Guy\u2019s Hospital in\nLondon. His death was unexpected and its causes remain uncertain. In\nan obituary for the Cambridge Review, Braithwaite wrote,\n\u2018His intellectual subtlety was combined with the most delightful\nsimplicity and candour. Intolerant of fools, he inspired others by his\nmental fertility and integrity. To one at least of his friends his\ndeath is as if a lighthouse were extinguished and we were left to\ngrope our way in the dark\u2019 (1930, 216).\n\nMellor\u2019s BBC radio programme on Ramsey, produced in 1978 (see\nOther Internet Resources below), features the first hand testimony of\nBraithwaite, Lettice Ramsey, and I.A. Richards. See also Sahlin 1990,\n221\u20139, Mellor 1995 and Taylor 2006. Ramsey\u2019s sister,\nMargaret Paul, provides a more personal account of Ramsey\u2019s\nlife, drawing upon letters and diaries, in her memoir (2012). Misak\n(2020) provides an in-depth intellectual biography of Ramsey.\n2. The Foundations of Logic and Mathematics\n\nRamsey, as we saw in the previous section, was still an undergraduate\nwhen, aged 19, he completed a translation of the Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus (Wittgenstein 1922). Alas, C. K. Ogden\ngot all the credit and it has been known since as the \u2018Ogden\ntranslation\u2019. Ramsey\u2019s translation is usually considered\nto be superseded by the Pears-McGuinness translation (1961), but one\nshould not lose sight of the fact that it was carefully scrutinized by\nWittgenstein, who gave it his seal of approval. Ramsey then wrote a\nsearching review of the Tractatus (1923) in which he raised\nmany serious objections (Methven 2015, chapter 4) (Sullivan 2005). One\nsuch objections is the \u2018colour-exclusion problem\u2019 (1923,\n473), against Wittgenstein\u2019s claim in 6.3751 that it is\n\u201clogically impossible\u201d that a point in the visual field be\nboth red and blue. This claim was linked to the requirement that\nelementary propositions be logically independent (otherwise, the\nanalysis of the proposition would not be completed), a pillar of the\nTractatus. Wittgenstein\u2019s recognition in 1929 that he\ncould not sustain his claim (Wittgenstein 1929), probably under\npressure at that stage from discussions with Ramsey, was to provoke\nthe downfall of the Tractatus.\n\nIn 1923 and 1924, Ramsey also visited Wittgenstein, who was teaching\nat Puchberg am Schneeberg (Lower Austria). During these visits,\nWittgenstein made changes to the text and translation, that were\nincorporated in later editions. (Details are given in (Lewy 1967).) At\nfirst under the spell, Ramsey became disillusioned. In 1923, he wrote\nhome that he would \u201ctry and pump him for ideas for\n[Principia Mathematica\u2019s] further development which I\nshall attempt\u201d (Wittgenstein [LO], 78), but in 1924 he remarked\nlaconically: \u201cHe is no good for my work\u201d (Sahlin 1997,\n64).\n\nRamsey\u2019s first major self-assigned task in the foundations of\nmathematics was indeed to revise Whitehead and Russell\u2019s\nPrincipia Mathematica, partly in the hope that his version\nwould meet some of Wittgenstein\u2019s criticisms of its axioms and\ntreatment of identity, but also because of some further defects he\ndiagnosed in its treatment of the paradoxes and in its inability\nproperly to account for the \u2018extensionality\u2019 of\nmathematics (1925a, [PP] 177\u2013178). For further details about the\ncontent of the following paragraph, see the entry for Principia\nMathematica.\n\nRamsey drew a distinction between \u2018logical\u2019 and\n\u2018semantical\u2019 paradoxes, with Russell\u2019s paradox\nbelonging to the former category and Richard\u2019s or\nGrelling\u2019s paradoxes to the latter (1925a, [PP] 183\u2013184).\nAccording to him, the heart of the problem was in the way the theory\nof types was devised to deal with the paradoxes, as understood in\nterms of the \u2018vicious-circle principle\u2019 (\u2018whatever\ninvolves all of a collection must not be one of the\ncollection\u2019):\n\n\nThese contradictions it was proposed to remove by what is called the\nTheory of Types, which consists really of two distinct parts directed\nrespectively against two groups of contradictions. These two parts\nwere unified by being both deduced in a rather sloppy way from the\n\u2018vicious-circle principle\u2019, but it seems to me essential\nto consider them separately. (1925a, [PP] 187)\n\n\nRamsey rightly saw that a \u2018simple\u2019 theory of types\n(sometimes called \u2018ramseyfied\u2019) that distinguishes types\nof propositional functions by their arguments would deal with\n\u2018logical\u2019 paradoxes, but in order to deal with the other\nparadoxes, Whitehead and Russell had introduced a\n\u2018branched\u2019 or \u2018ramified\u2019 theory of types with\na hierarchy of levels of functions (and of propositions), that led to\nfurther difficulties, one of which being the inability even to\nformulate theorems of classical mathematics such as the least upper\nbound theorem, unless one introduced the \u2018Axiom of\nReducibility\u2019 according to which for any function at any level\nthere exists an equivalent one at the first level (1925a, [PP]\n187\u2013192). (Another worry, that one could not formulate\nmathematical induction in its full generality turns out to have been\nunfounded.) Wittgenstein had pointed out in the Tractatus\nthat it is not a tautology (6.1233), so that it could hardly serve as\nan axiom. To circumvent this, Ramsey introduced his own notion of\n\u2018predicative function\u2019 and showed that if one gets rid of\nthe \u2018vicious-circle principle\u2019, the levels can be\ncollapsed and the need for the \u2018Axiom of Reducibility\u2019 is\nobviated (1925a, [PP] 195\u2013205). Thus, Ramsey had in effect shown\nhow to deal with the paradoxes and the \u2018extensionality\u2019 of\nmathematics without the need for a \u2018ramified\u2019 theory of\ntypes. (In this he was preceded by Leon Chwistek (Chwistek 1921).)\nThis, Ramsey concluded, would secure mathematics against the\n\u201cBolshevik menace\u201d of the intuitionist critique of Brouwer\nand Weyl (1925a, [PP] 219).\n\nRamsey also took seriously Wittgenstein\u2019s critique\n(5.53\u20135.533) of the definition of identity in Principia\nMathematica (\u221713.01) in terms of indiscernibility (with\nF a predicative function): \n\\[ x\\! =\\! y \\;=_{df}\\; \\forall F(Fx \\to Fy) \\]\n\n\nWittgenstein argued that to say that two things are the same,\nx = y, is nonsense, while x = x is\nempty and showed how to get rid of identity with an\n\u2018exclusive\u2019 reading of the variables (Hintikka 1956),\n(Wehmeier 2008), (Wehmeier 2012), with the exception of some\npropositions such as the axiom of infinity that cannot be so read, and\nare thus to be rejected (5.535). To save the latter (and the axiom of\nchoice, which was then called the \u2018Multiplicative Axiom\u2019),\nRamsey introduced \u2018functions in extension\u2019 (including\narbitrary pairings of arguments with values, and indicated here with\nthe subscript \\(e\\)), replacing the above with: \n\\[ \\forall \\phi_e (\\phi_{e}x \\equiv \\phi_{e} y)\\]\n\n\nHe then argued that this is a tautology if \\(x = y\\), and a\ncontradiction if \\(x \\neq y\\). This is the subject on which he\neventually sparred with Wittgenstein, when the latter wrote a letter\nin 1927 (reproduced in [NP] 340\u2013341). Wittgenstein argued that\neither way this formula is nonsensical and cannot be substituted for\nx = y. Two drafts of a rejoinder by Ramsey are\npreserved ([NP] 342\u2013346), but the matter was dropped\nsubsequently, although Wittgenstein came back to it repeatedly after\nRamsey\u2019s death, for example in (Wittgenstein [BT], \u00a7 113).\n(For further discussion see Marion 1995; Sullivan 1995; and Methven\n2015, chapter 7.)\n\nIt is said that, when Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in January\n1929, it was primarily to discuss philosophy with Ramsey, who he\nobviously deemed a worthy interlocutor, and they reportedly met on a\nregular basis, until Ramsey\u2019s death the following January. They\nboth left behind manuscripts which show that Ramsey had shifted his\nviews on a number of topics, while Wittgenstein\u2019s thought was\nalso set in motion towards his later views. In the preface to the\nPhilosophical Investigations, he wrote:\n\n\nFor since I began to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen\nyears ago, I could not but recognize grave mistakes in what I set out\nin that first book. I was helped to realize these mistakes \u2013 to\na degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate \u2013 by the\ncriticism which my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I\ndiscussed them in innumerable conversations during the last two years\nof his\n life.[1]\n (Wittgenstein 1953 [PI, 4])\n\n\nAlthough one can at least point out with McGuinness that\n\u201cWittgenstein clearly learnt a lot from Ramsey\u201d\n(McGuinness 2006, 25), if one asks who made the larger contribution in\nthese discussions, there is considerable disagreement, with claims\nranging from the idea that literally none of the later\nWittgenstein\u2019s key ideas can be traced to Ramsey (Kienzler 1997,\n75\u201376), to claims of various degrees of a more substantial\ninfluence by Ramsey on Wittgenstein (Glock 2005, Majer 1991; Marion\n1998, chapters 4\u20135; Marion 2012; Methven 2015, chapter 9; Misak\n2016a, chapter 7; Misak 2016b; Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990; Sahlin 1997).\nIt is perhaps better simply to talk of a confluence of ideas, and the\nfollowing, being restricted to Ramsey, will show that he reasoned\nalong lines largely independent from Wittgenstein, and began shifting\nhis views before 1929.\n\nThis confluence is particularly visible in texts relating to the\nfoundations of mathematics, where Ramsey became disillusioned with\nPrincipia Mathematica, perhaps under the influence of\nWittgenstein, whose criticisms of the axioms of infinity and\nreducibility, he had already taken seriously in \u2018The Foundations\nof Mathematics\u2019, as was just pointed out. Ramsey initially\nadopted Wittgenstein\u2019s view of the quantifiers in the\nTractatus as \u2018logical products\u2019 and\n\u2018sums\u2019, with universality being expressed, for predicate\nF, as an infinite conjunction \n\\[Fa \\: \\wedge\\: Fb \\:\\wedge\\: Fc \\:\\wedge\\: \\ldots \\]\n\n\nAnd existence as an infinite disjunction \n\\[Fa \\: \\lor\\: Fb \\:\\lor\\: Fc \\:\\lor\\: \\ldots \\]\n\n\n(1926c, [PP] 240; 1927a, [PP] 48\u201349). In absence of a rule of\ngeneralization, one has at most that a universality implies any of its\ninstances: \n\\[\\tag{1.1} \\forall x Fx \\to Fa \\]\n\n\nand the product becomes infinite, and without a rule of existential\nelimination all one has is that an instance implies existence:\n\n\\[\\tag{1.2} Fa \\to \\exists xFx \\]\n\n\nThe disjunction being infinite, it cannot sum up all the\ndisjuncts.\n\nWittgenstein had hinted in the Tractatus at a logic-free\nequational calculus for arithmetic (6.02\u20136.031 & 6.241), but\nRamsey thought this to be a \u201cridiculously narrow view of\nmathematics\u201d (1925a, [PP] 180), and wanted the convenience\nafforded by quantifiers. He assessed two alternatives to Wittgenstein,\nThoralf Skolem\u2019s proposal simply to do away with the\nquantifiers, in a paper where he introduced primitive recursive\narithmetic (Skolem 1923 [1967]) and Hermann Weyl\u2019s suggestion in\n\u2018\u00dcber die neue Grundlagenkrise der Mathematik\u2019 (Weyl\n1921 [1998]) \u2013 the very paper in which he joined Brouwer in his\ncritique of classical mathematics, \u2013 that universality should be\nunderstood in analogy with bank drafts, as \u2018instructions for\njudgements\u2019, while existence would be a \u2018judgment\nabstract\u2019, classical existence being compared to a treasure map\nthat does not tell us where to find the treasure (Weyl 1921 [1998],\n97\u201398). These explanations happen to justify (1.1) and (1.2)\nabove. Weyl claimed further that (1.1) and (1.2) cannot be negated\nsince one could not, say, survey infinitely many disjuncts, so the law\nof excluded middle would not hold.\n\nIn two of his last papers, \u2018Principles of Finitist\nMathematics\u2019 and \u2018The Formal Structure of Intuitionist\nMathematics\u2019 ([NP] 197\u2013200), Ramsey sided with Weyl. It\nappears that he wanted to obtain arithmetic by adding quantifiers,\nwith Weyl\u2019s rules, to Skolem\u2019s primitive recursive\narithmetic. But he did not provide a rule of existential elimination\nand rules that he proposed in these papers appear to restrict formulas\nwith quantifiers to those that can be converted to prenex normal form\n(with quantifiers prefixed on the left, followed with a\nquantifier-free matrix). In intuitionism, the law of the excluded\nmiddle applies to atomic formulas and, if quantifiers are in prenex\nnormal form, the theory remains constructive. This is what Ramsey\ncaptured, but the result is not the full intuitionistic arithmetic, as\nnot all intuitionistic formulas are equivalent to prenex formulas. In\n\u2018Principles of Finitist Mathematics\u2019, he stated that his\nrules provide \u201call the logical modes allowed by the\nfinitists\u201d ([NP] 201), but if he meant\n\u2018intuitionism\u2019, the claim was inaccurate.\n\nRamsey already discussed Weyl earlier, for example in\n\u2018Mathematical Logic\u2019 (1926c, [PP] 230 & 233), without\napproving him, so one needs to explain why he changed his mind in\n1928\u201329. This may be the result of changes in his underlying\nconception of theories from his 1928 manuscript On Truth\n([OT] 33\u201334) to \u2018Theories\u2019 (1929). According to his\nlater view, a \u2018primary system\u2019 of true or false\nobservational statements is entailed, via a\n\u2018dictionary\u2019, by a \u2018secondary system\u2019 of\nhypotheses (1929a, [PP] 112\u2013115). This is a view that has roots\nin both the introduction to Heinrich Hertz\u2019s The Principles\nof Mechanics (Hertz 1899) and in chapter VI of Norman\nCampbell\u2019s Physics. The Elements (Campbell 1920), but\nRamsey described, as we shall see, hypotheses not as statements or\npropositions, but, adapting Weyl\u2019s expression, as \u2018rules\nfor judging\u2019.\n\nAt a deeper level, Ramsey\u2019s change of mind can be traced back to\nhis having read C. S. Peirce\u2019s Chance, Love and Logic\n(Peirce 1923). In \u2018Fact and Propositions\u2019 (1925) he had\nalready written: \u201cThe essence of pragmatism I take to be this,\nthat the meaning of a sentence is to be defined by reference to the\nactions to which asserting it would lead, or, more vaguely still, by\nits possible causes and effects\u201d (1927a, [PP] 51). This forms\npart of what Nils-Eric Sahlin called \u2018British Pragmatism\u2019\n(Sahlin 1997, 65; Marion 2012), and Cheryl Misak \u2018Cambridge\nPragmatism\u2019 (Misak 2016). This causal theory allowed him to tie\nlogical form with causal properties, for example when he argued that\ndisbelieving p and believing its negation \u00ac p\nhave the same causal properties (1927a, [PP] 44). (There is a link\nworth noticing here with his view on \u2018Universals\u2019 (1925),\nsince this suggestion allows him to avoid \u2018negative\nfacts\u2019.) Ramsey suggested at that stage that a causal theory of\nthis sort could accommodate the quantifiers as understood (as above)\nby Wittgenstein: \u201cFeeling belief towards \u2018For all \\(x\\),\n\\(fx\\)\u2019 has certain causal properties which we call its\nexpressing agreement only with the possibility that all the values of\n\\(fx\\) are true\u201d (1927a, [PP] 49). By 1928\u20131929, however,\nhis pragmatism finally led him to abandon this suggestion.\n\nIn his review of the Tractatus, Ramsey thought that\nWittgenstein\u2019s suggestion for eliminating the subject (5.542)\nwas \u201can important advance\u201d (1923, 469), but he assumed the\nopposite in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 (1928). In a passage\nwhere he admitted following Peirce (1926a, [PP] 90 n. 2), he argued\nthat the human mind \u201cworks essentially according to general\nrules or habits\u201d (1926a, [PP] 90):\n\n\nThe mind works by general laws; therefore if it infers \\(q\\) from\n\\(p\\), this will generally be because \\(q\\) is an instance of a\nfunction \\(\\phi x\\) and \\(p\\) the corresponding instance of a function\n\\(\\psi x\\) such that the mind would always infer \\(\\phi x\\) from\n\\(\\psi x\\). (1926a, [PP] 91)\n\n\nAnd, again in pragmatist manner, he argued that one judges habits in\nterms of their success: \u201cgiven a habit of a certain form, we can\npraise or blame it accordingly as the degree of belief it produces is\nnear or far from the actual proportion in which the habit leads to\ntruth\u201d (1926a, [PP] 92).\n\nIn \u2018General Propositions and Causality\u2019 (1929), Ramsey\nfollowed this with Peirce\u2019s idea that beliefs \u201cguide our\nactions\u201d (Peirce 1992, 114), describing a belief as a \u201cmap\nby which we steer\u201d (1929b, [PP] 146). It is for this very reason\nthat he could not countenance the belief qua map being\ninfinite: \u201cif we professedly extend it to infinity, it is no\nlonger a map; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over\nbefore we need its remoter parts\u201d (1929b, [PP] 146). He then\nintroduced the notion of \u2018variable hypotheticals\u2019 as\nforming the \u201csystem with which the speaker meets the\nfuture\u201d and described them in terms strongly reminiscent of\nWeyl:\n\n\nVariable hypotheticals are not judgments but rules for judging\n\u2018If I meet a \\(\\phi\\), I shall regard it as a \\(\\psi\\)\u2019.\nThis cannot be negated but it can be disagreed with\nby one who does not adopt it. (1929b, [PP] 149)\n\n\u2026 when we assert a causal law we are asserting not a fact, not\nan infinite conjunction, nor a connection of universals, but a\nvariable hypothetical which is not strictly a proposition at all, but\na formula from which we derive propositions. (1929b, [PP], 159)\n\n\nThere is indeed a definite connection here with his growing qualms, of\na \u2018finitist\u2019 nature, about the axiom of infinity:\n\u201cSo too there may be an infinite totality, but what seems to be\npropositions about it are again variable hypotheticals and\n\u2018infinite collection\u2019 is really nonsense\u201d (1929b,\n[PP] 160).\n\nRamsey\u2019s last papers thus show that he was moving towards an\noriginal synthesis of Weyl\u2019s intuitionism (or finitism) with\npragmatism (Majer 1989; Majer 1991; Marion 2012; Misak 2016a (chapter\n6); Misak 2018; Sahlin 1990, chapter 4). As for the confluence of\nideas, it is possible that Wittgenstein\u2019s notion of\n\u2018hypothesis\u2019 had other sources (Marion 2008), but he also\ncame to reject his own view of the quantifiers in the\nTractatus (for example in his Cambridge lectures\n(Wittgenstein [LC], 217 & 219)), and his own language bore strong\nresemblance to that of Weyl and Ramsey when he spoke of a hypothesis\nas a \u201claw for forming expectations\u201d (Wittgenstein [PR],\n\u00a7228).\n3. Ontology\n\nRamsey is famous for his denial of the particular-universal\ndistinction. But his ontological vision was even more radical and\naustere than this suggests because Ramsey also denied the existence of\ncomplex entities, including complex universals, facts and\npropositions. Ramsey\u2019s main arguments for this austere ontology\nappear in his two landmark papers \u201cUniversals\u201d (1925b) and\n\u201cFacts and Propositions\u201d (1927a). At a general level we\ncan think of Ramsey as endeavoring to bring our views of ontology\nclear of the shadows of words (MacBride 2005a, 2018 chapter 10).\n\nAt this point in his intellectual development, the mid-1920s, Ramsey\nwas developing the insights he found in Russell and Wittgenstein. But\nRamsey not only took many of their ideas to a new level of detail and\nsophistication but pushed boundaries by showing that they had not gone\nfar enough. \u201cUniversals\u201d provides a luminous example of\nRamsey pushing against boundaries that had held Russell back.\nAccording to Russell, \u201cThe influence of language on philosophy\nhas, I believe, been profound and almost unrecognized. If we are not\nto be misled by this influence it is necessary to become conscious of\nit and to ask how far it is legitimate\u201d (Russell 1924, 330).\nRussell was specifically concerned that the subject-predicate form\ncommon to Indo-European languages had misled Western philosophers,\nconditioning them to take for granted a substance-attribute ontology\nwhilst being blind to the existence of relations. Russell proposed to\nremedy the situation by introducing alongside the category of\nparticulars, a broader category of universals which subsumed both\n(monadic) attributes and (polyadic) relations. But, in\n\u201cUniversals\u201d, Ramsey argued that Russell had not gone far\nenough, because the particular-universal distinction itself was just a\nfurther shadow cast by language. Ramsey wrote, \u201cnearly all\nphilosophers, including Mr Russell himself have been misled by\nlanguage in a far more far-reaching way than that\u201d, i.e. more\nfar-reaching than being led merely to deny the existence of relations,\nbecause \u201cthe whole theory of particulars and universals is due\nto mistaking for a fundamental characteristic of reality, what is\nmerely a characteristic of language\u201d (1925b, 405). But Ramsey\nwasn\u2019t aiming to replace the particular-universal distinction\nwith an alternative distinction of his own. Instead he aimed to\ninculcate in his reader a studied indifference, which meant\nwithholding judgment, at least a priori, about the forms or categories\nof atomic objects, as Wittgenstein had done in the\nTractatus.\n\nRamsey diagnosed that Russell had been led astray by supposing the\nsubject-predicate distinction to be a logical distinction. So Ramsey\ndevoted \u201cUniversals\u201d to arguing it isn\u2019t logical.\nRamsey recognised there wasn\u2019t just one candidate for being the\nsubject-predicate distinction. So \u201cUniversals\u201d is divided\ninto an examination of several candidates. Ramsey argued they reflect\nmerely accidental features of our language or subjective needs or\nbiased interests, so none of them provide a basis for an objective\nclassification of what there is.\n\nRamsey begins \u2018Universals\u2019 with what was to became a\ncelebrated argument of early analytic philosophy (see Sahlin 1990,\n192\u2013202 and Simons 1991 for helpful accounts of Ramsey\u2019s\nmain lines of argument in \u201cUniversals\u201d). To persuade us\nthere are serious issues to engage here, Ramsey compared\n\n(3.1)  Socrates is\nwise.\n\nand,\n\n(3.2)  Wisdom is a\ncharacteristic of Socrates.\n\n\nWhilst they are different sentences, Ramsey invites us to agree that\nthey say the same about what\u2019s out there even though they differ\nin their surface forms. He reflected, \u2018Now of one these\nsentences \u2018Socrates\u2019 is the subject, of the other\n\u2018wisdom\u2019; and so which of the two is subject, which\npredicate, depends upon what particular sentence we use to express our\nproposition, and so had nothing to do with the logical nature of\nSocrates or wisdom, but is a matter entirely for language\u2019\n(1925b, 404). Ramsey hypothesises that the subject-predicate\ndistinction isn\u2019t a semantic or representational distinction at\nall, hence not in the business of marking a division of things, but\nrather a distinction which we employ to communicate to conversational\npartners the focus of our discussion: \u201cIf the centre of our\ninterest is Socrates we say \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019, if we are\ndiscussing wisdom we may say \u2018wisdom is a characteristic of\nSocrates\u2019; but whichever we say we mean the same\nthing\u201d.\n\nRamsey\u2019s aim was not to conclusively establish this hypothesis\non the basis that (3.1) and (3.2) are used to make the same\nassertion\u2013as indeed many of his critics have supposed. What they\nmiss is that to be fit for purpose, Ramsey\u2019s argument only had\nto be strong enough to make us seriously entertain the possibility\nthat the subject-predicate distinction doesn\u2019t serve a\nrepresentational function, because that\u2019s enough to throw doubt\nupon the procedure of classifying things on the basis of the\nsubject-predicate distinction, hence strong enough to make it evident\nthat \u201cthe question requires a new examination\u201d (1925b,\n405).\n\n(Anscombe [1959, 108], Geach [1950, 474\u20135; 1975, 143\u20134]\nand Dummett [1973, 63\u20134] have all criticised Ramsey\u2019s\nargument here on the grounds that whilst a predicate may be negated a\nname may not \u2013 although see Anscombe\u2019s\n\u2018Retractation\u2019 [1965]. Coming from a different direction,\nSimons [1991, 159], Dokic and Engel [2002, 40\u20131] and Lowe [2004,\n307] argue that Ramsey was mistaken to think that ontological issues\ncould ever be settled in logico-linguistic terms. MacBride [2005a,b]\nargues that the former criticisms miss their intended mark because\nRamsey was committed to denying that negative predicates correspond to\nthe constituents of atomic facts; whereas the latter criticisms miss\ntheir mark because Ramsey was in fact arguing that logical reflection\nfails to determine the nature of the atomic facts. Hochberg [2004,\n197\u20139], Mulligan [2000], Simons [1992, 151\u20132] raise\nfurther difficulties for Ramsey\u2019s initial argument that builds\nupon the equivalence of (3.1) and (3.2) but MacBride [2018,\n207\u201310] argues that these criticisms rest upon a failure to\nappreciate the radical character of Ramsey\u2019s challenge.)\n\nRamsey begins his new examination by considering whether molecular\nstatements can be analysed into subjects and predicates \u2013\nspecifically predicates which stand for complex universals. He argues,\nreductio ad absurdum, that they don\u2019t. He assumes that\nif two analyses of a proposition invoke different constituents then\nthey are analyses of different propositions. Absurdity results when\nthis assumption is combined with the claim that complex predicates are\nterms for complex universals. This is because more than one complex\npredicate may be isolated in a sentence of the form\n\u2018aRb\u2019 \u2013 predicates that may be represented\nby \u2018xRb\u2019, \u2018aRy\u2019\nand\u2018xRy\u2019. If these predicates are terms for\ndifferent universals, then the sentence \u2018aRb\u2019\nexpresses no less than three propositions. The propositions are\ndistinct because they correspond to the three different collections of\nconstituents: (i) xRb, a, (ii) aRx,\nb, and (iii) xRy, a, b. But this\nis absurd because \u2018aRb\u2019 says only one thing: that\naRb. Ramey concluded, \u201cso the theory of complex\nuniversals is responsible for an incomprehensible trinity, as\nsenseless as that of theology\u201d (1925b, 406). Ramsey must also\nhave thought but doesn\u2019t spell out, that it\u2019s a\nconsequence of this argument that complex particulars should be\ndismissed too \u2013 otherwise particulars would be distinguished\nfrom universals in terms of complexity. (For discussion of\nRamsey\u2019s argument against complex universals see Oliver 1992;\nMellor 1992; and MacBride 2005a, 86\u201394; 2018,\n210\u2013220.)\n\nRamsey next looks to see if a logical distinction between subject and\npredicate applies to atomic statements. Russell had argued that\npredicates can be distinguished from subjects by the fact that the\nformer exhibit a distinctive incompleteness because they carry the\nform of the statements in which occur. Ramsey agreed that it\u2019s\nnatural to feel that an adjective like \u2018wise\u2019 is\nincomplete in a manner that \u2018Socrates\u2019 is not. But, Ramsey\nargued, predicates only appear to be especially incomplete because as\nordinary language users we overlook relevant data: we routinely\ndistinguish wide from narrow scope occurrences of predicates but we\ndon\u2019t do the same for subjects even though the same distinction\ncan be drawn for them. Ramsey cites Russell\u2019s theory of\ndescriptions as the inspiration for the wide-narrow scope distinction,\nwhich Ramsey elaborates in terms of a distinction between more and\nless encompassing ranges of propositions in which an expression\nfigures. Ramsey concludes that to be a substantive (or adjective)\n\u201cis not an objective but a subjective property, in the sense\nthat it depends not indeed on any one mind but on the common elements\nin all men\u2019s minds and purposes\u201d (1925b, 413).\n\nSince the difference between \u2018Socrates\u2019 and\n\u2018wise\u2019 turns out to be subjective in this way, it tells us\nnothing about the objective classification of the constituents of\natomic facts. Moreover, Ramsey continued, once we are explicit about\nthe wide and narrow scope occurrences of atomic expressions, there is\nno reason to think that any of them are especially incomplete. Ramsey\nheld that it is only the \u2018biassed interest\u2019 of\nmathematicians, i.e. their extensionalism, that make things appear\notherwise (1925b, 416). They neglect to distinguish between complex\npredicates which really do require variables for their depiction\n(\\(xRa \\lor xSb\\)) and atomic expressions which don\u2019t\n(\u2018\\(f\\)\u2019 in \u2018\\(fa\\)\u2019), because they are only\ninterested in the extensional matter whether these expressions are\ntrue or false of the same things. But to avoid \u2018useless\ncomplication\u2019 mathematicians treat the latter terms as requiring\nvariables for their representation too (\u2018\\(fx\\)\u2019), hence\nproducing the appearance that there is some class of atomic terms\nwhich are incomplete because they require variables (1925b,\n414\u20135). But, Ramsey continued, if it were not for the biased\ninterests of the mathematician, we would allow \u2018\\(f\\)\u2019 to\nstand alone, so removing the appearance of an especially incomplete\nclass of atomic terms.\n\nHaving completed his examination, Ramsey concluded that we can know\nnothing whatever about the classification of the constituents of\natomic facts. But when he came to reprise his argument a year later in\n\u201cUniversals and \u2018the Method of Analysis\u2019\u201d\n(1926b), Ramsey adopted the more modest conclusion that whilst we\ncannot know a priori the forms of the atomic facts we may yet\nknow them a posteriori: \u201cWhen I wrote my article I was\nsure that it was impossible to discover atomic propositions by actual\nanalysis. Of this I am now very doubtful, and I cannot be sure that\nthey may not be discovered to be all of one or another of a series of\nforms which can be expressed by \\(R_1(x)\\), \\(R_2(x,y)\\),\n\\(R_3(x,y,z)\\)\u2026. This I admit may be found to be the case, but\nno one can as yet be certain what atomic propositions there are, it\ncannot be positively asserted; and there is no strong presumption in\nits favour, for I think that the argument of my article establishes\nthat nothing of the sort can be known a priori\u201d (1926b,\n31) (see Methven 2018 for discussion of the relationship between\nRamsey 1925b and 1926b).\n\nRamsey\u2019s less well-known arguments against the ontology of facts\nand propositions appear in the context of Ramsey\u2019s discussion of\nthe nature of truth and belief. In \u201cFacts and\nPropositions\u201d (1927a) he argued against the existence of facts\non the grounds that the expression \u2018the fact that\u2026\u2019\ncannot be completed to make either a name or a description of a fact\n(1927a, 155\u20137). Indeed, he claimed, \u2018the fact\nthat\u2026\u2019 disappears upon paraphrase of the contexts in\nwhich it occurs. As Ramsey put the point (1927a, 159):\n\n(3.3)  the fact that\n\\(a\\) has \\(R\\) to \\(b\\) exists \n\n\nis no different from\n\n(3.4)  \\(a\\) has \\(R\\)\nto \\(b\\)\n\n\nBy \u2018is no different from\u2019 (his words) Ramsey meant\nsomething like \u201csemantically equivalent\u201d. So his argument\nis that (3.3) is just a long-winded way of saying (3.4) and because\n(3.4) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact, it follows\nthat (3.3) has no constituent expression that refers to a fact\neither.\n\nWe can imagine Ramsey unpacking this argument further. Statements like\n(3.3) commit us to the existence of facts if any statements do; they\nconstitute our best effort to explicitly affirm the existence of\nfacts. Since even statements like (3.3) don\u2019t commit us to\nfacts, because they\u2019re just paraphrases of statements like\n(3.4), we cannot have reason to believe in the existence of facts at\nall. To transpose a remark of Ramsey\u2019s from another context, if\nyou can\u2019t say that facts exist, you can\u2019t whistle it\neither. We could call this Ramsey\u2019s \u2018redundancy theory of\nfacts\u2019, emphasising another parallel, this time with his famous\nredundancy theory of truth (according to which \u2018\\(a\\) has \\)(R\\)\nto \\(b\\) is true\u2019 says the same as \u2018\\(a\\) has \\(R\\) to\n\\(b\\)\u2019).\n\nRamsey renounced propositions conceived as the single objects of\njudgment, which may be true or false, for the reasons that had already\nled Russell to give up propositions so conceived, namely \u2018the\nincredibility of the existence of objects as \u201cthat Caesar died\nin his bed\u201d which could be described as objective falsehoods,\nand the mysterious nature of the difference, on this theory, between\ntruth and falsehood\u2019 (1927a, 153\u20134). Ramsey, like Russell,\ndidn\u2019t spell this out, but we can think of Ramsey as pointing,\ninter alia, to the difficulty of explaining the unity of a\nproposition \\(aRb\\) in terms of \\(R\\)\u2019s holdings between \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\), which is difficult to understand if the proposition is\nfalse since then \\(R\\) doesn\u2019t hold between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nRamsey continued to find objective falsehoods incredible in his later\nmanuscript \u2018On Truth\u2019: \u2018it is only the hardiest\nverbalists who can persuade themselves \u2018that the earth is\nflat\u2019 is the name of something real\u2019 ([OT] 85).\n\nRamsey concluded with Russell, \u2018that a judgment had no single\nobject, but is a multiple relation of the mind or mental factors to\nmany objects, those, namely, which we should ordinarily call\nconstituents of the propositions judged\u2019 (1927a, 154). So we can\nthink of Ramsey offering two arguments for renouncing propositions\nconceived as single objects: a negative argument, that they\u2019re\nincredible and mysterious, but also a positive argument arguing that\npropositions so conceived are dispensable based upon Ramsey\u2019s\nown views about truth and belief which don\u2019t require them. In\n\u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 Ramsey put forward a version of\nWittgenstein\u2019s picture theory according to which a subject\n\u2018will believe that \\(aRb\\) by having names for \\(a\\), \\(R\\), and\n\\(b\\) connected in his mind and accompanied by a feeling of\nbelief\u2019 (1927a, 160) but Ramsey was already pushing in more\nradical, pragmatist direction which emphasised the significance of\naction for understanding the notion of belief, hence shifting\nattention further away from an ontology of facts and propositions.\n(See the section on Belief and Truth.)\n\nIt is Ramsey\u2019s ontological views on the particular-universal\ndistinction that have attracted the most attention. On the historical\nfront, Ruth Barcan Marcus (1993) argues that Ramsey\u2019s\n\u201cUniversals\u201d bore a significant influence on\nRussell\u2019s subsequent intellectual development; see MacBride 2004\nand Hochberg 2004 for further discussion. MacBride (2018) puts\nRamsey\u2019s \u201cUniversals\u201d in historical context, arguing\nthat \u201cUniversals\u201d should be interpreted as the final stage\nin an extended conversation about particulars and universals,\ninvolving G.E. Moore, Russell, Wittgenstein and Whitehead. Misak\n(2020) explores the connection between \u201cUniversals\u201d and\nRamsey\u2019s later pragmatist writings. Braithwaite (1926) and\nStrawson (1959, chapter 5) argued, contra Ramsey, that the\nparticular-universal distinction may be understood in spatio-temporal\nterms. See MacBride 2005c and Lowe 2006 (chapter 7) for further\ndiscussion of Ramsey\u2019s views on universals from a contemporary\npoint of view.\n4. Belief and Truth\n4.1 Belief and Assertion\n\nRamsey\u2019s primary analysis of belief and assertion appears in his\npapers \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 (1926a), \u2018Facts and\nPropositions\u2019 (1927a) and \u2018The Nature of Truth\u2019\n(1929c), with some significant remarks on general beliefs made in\n\u2018Universals of Law and of Fact\u2019 (1928b) and \u2018General\nPropositions and Causality\u2019 (1929b).\n\nIn \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 Ramsey presents his view on the\nnature of partial belief, and this paper is considered the inaugural\nwork of the family of approaches to probability known as\nsubjectivism. Since the present section focuses on his\nsemantic analysis of belief and assertion, and not on subjective\nprobabilities, the analysis of partial belief developed in\n\u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 will be left aside.\n\nRamsey was a pragmatist about belief (Hookway 2005, 182ff; Dokic and\nEngel 2002, 2, 8, 55), although not about truth. He explicitly\ndeclares his pragmatism in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 (1926a)\nand in \u2018Fact and Propositions\u2019 (1927a). In \u2018Truth\nand Probability\u2019, he explains his approach to rationality as\n\u2018a kind of pragmatism: we judge mental habits by whether they\nwork\u2019 (1926a, [PP] 93\u201394). In \u2018Facts and\nPropositions\u2019, in contrast, the topic is the notion of meaning:\n\u2018The essence of pragmatism I take to be this, that the meaning\nof a sentence is to be determined by reference to the actions to which\nasserting it would lead\u2019 (1927a, [PP] 51). He attributes his\npragmatism about meaning to the influence of Bertrand Russell. In\nfact, in The Analysis of Mind (1921), Russell explained the\nintentional properties of words through their causal history. As Acero\n(2005, 16) stresses, Russell at that time identified the meaning of a\nword with its use, and it seems to be this aspect of Russell\u2019s\nphilosophy of mind that Ramsey acknowledges as the source of his\npragmatism about meaning in \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 (cf.\nDokic and Engel 2002, 22). Sahlin (1990, 70) and Hookway (2005,\n185\u2013187) point out that Peirce must also have had an effect on\nRamsey\u2019s pragmatist views since many themes in Peirce\u2019s\nearly works are detectable in Ramsey\u2019s writings (Hookway 2005,\n185\u20136). More recently, Misak (2016a) has tracked Peirce\u2019s\ninfluence on Ramsey in full detail, using the entries on Peirce that\nRamsey inserted into his diary. It is now clear that Ramsey read\nPeirce extensively and that the American philosopher deeply influenced\nRamsey\u2019s views on meaning, truth and probability (Misak 2016a,\n157).\n\nAs a pragmatist, Ramsey individuates beliefs by attending to their\ncauses and effects. Thus, attitudes towards two sentences prompted by\nthe same causes and producing the same effects express the same\nbelief, no matter the linguistic constitution of the sentences used to\nexpress it. \u2018Belief\u2019, Ramsey acknowledges, is an ambiguous\nterm (1927a, [PP] 40). Both human beings and non-linguistic animals\ncan be said to possess beliefs. In non-linguistic animals, beliefs are\ndispositions to act; in linguistic animals, beliefs are mental states\nwith a particular kind of content that involves entertaining words.\nChickens that avoid eating a particular kind of caterpillar, due to\nsystematically connecting it with disagreeable past experiences,\nbelieve that caterpillars of this kind are poisonous. This is\nRamsey\u2019s causal theory of belief, which Dokic and Engel (2002,\n24) extend to beliefs of any kind and attribute to Peirce\u2019s\ninfluence on Ramsey. The beliefs of linguistic animals are\nspecifically defined in terms of attitudes towards complexes of signs\nwith logical structure (Hookway 2005, 185). Both kinds of belief,\nlinguistic and non-linguistic, are analysed in pragmatist terms, in\nwhich \u2018the relations between belief and action do take centre\nstage in some of [Ramsey\u2019s] most influential writings on this\ntopic\u2019 (Hookway 2005, 186).\n\nEven if the main targets of Ramsey\u2019s analysis are those beliefs\nexpressed in words and \u2018consciously asserted and denied\u2019\n(1927a, [PP] 40), it is still illuminating to consider his treatment\nof animal beliefs, in which the pragmatist connection between belief\nand action is yet more perspicuous.\n\nRamsey distinguishes mental and objective factors in his analysis of\nbelief. In the case of the chicken, the simplest one, the mental\nfactor is part of the animal\u2019s external behaviour (1927a, 159),\ni.e. its behaviour of refraining from eating caterpillars on the basis\nof disagreeable past experiences. The objective factor in this case is\na conglomerate of relevant aspects of the world, i.e. the caterpillar\nand the property of being poisonous, with which the mental factor\nstands in some kind of relation. In beliefs expressed in words, on the\nother hand, the mental factor is partly constituted by those words or\nsymbols \u2018spoken aloud or merely imagined, connected\ntogether\u2019. Beliefs expressed in words can be classified into\nthree different categories: (i) those whose content is represented by\npredicates or relations together with their arguments, i.e. by atomic\nsentences with simple structures such as \u2018aRb\u2019,\n(ii) those whose content includes logical connectives\n(\u2018not\u2019, \u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019), and (iii)\ngeneral beliefs. In (i), the simplest linguistic case, an agent having\na belief that aRb means that she connects the words\n\u2018a\u2019, \u2018R\u2019 and\n\u2018b\u2019 in her mind in a certain way. A further\ningredient of the mental factor in linguistic creatures is a sort of\nfeeling that accompanies the words in one\u2019s mind. By\n\u2018feeling\u2019 Ramsey does not mean a private sentiment, but\nrather some attitude of the agent that might be expressed in less\nsubjective terms, such as \u2018\u201cspecific quality\u201d or\n\u201cact of assertion\u201d and \u201cact of denial\u201d\u2019\n(loc. cit., n. 2).\n\nPurely private feelings towards contents, Ramsey argues, play no role\nin the analysis of belief and are useless for measuring degrees of\nbelief, as he explains in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019:\n\nAs soon as we regard belief quantitatively, this seems to me the only\nview we can take of it. It could well be held that the difference\nbetween believing and not believing lies in the presence or absence of\nintrospective feelings. But when we seek to know what is the\ndifference between believing more firmly and believing less firmly, we\ncan no longer regard it as consisting in having more or less of\ncertain observable feelings; at least I personally cannot recognize\nany such feelings. (1926a, [PP] 65).\n\n\nThere are basically two reasons why he takes private feelings to be\nirrelevant for the analysis of belief. The first of these concerns the\ndifficulty of assigning objective measurements, but undoubtedly the\ndefinitive reason rests on the fact that our most unshakable beliefs\ncome without any particular sensation (Dokic and Engel 2002, 7). As\nRamsey puts it: \u2018[N]o one feels strongly about things he takes\nfor granted\u2019 (loc. cit.). At this point, the similarities with\nthe view that Wittgenstein held in his pragmatist period are evident\n(for the mutual influence between Ramsey and Wittgenstein, see \u00a72\nabove).\n\nLinguistic beliefs of the second category, i.e. those that also\ninclude logical terms such as \u2018not\u2019, \u2018and\u2019 and\n\u2018or\u2019 are more complex. Concerning them, Ramsey heavily\nrelies on the Tractarian view of logical constants. Like Wittgenstein,\nRamsey thinks that logical words are not names, i.e. they do not\nrepresent. The meanings of \u2018not\u2019 and \u2018or\u2019 are\ndetermined by the agents\u2019 attitudes towards the sentences that\ninclude them. Believing that not-p and disbelieving that\np are \u2018equivalent occurrences\u2019 (1927a, [PP] 43),\ni.e. they express the same attitude because their practical effects\nare indistinguishable (1927a, [PP] 44; Dokic and Engel 2002, 24).\n\nA specific difficulty in analyzing beliefs of this second category\nderives from the need to identify attitudes held towards several\natomic sentences at the same time, while when atomic sentences are\nconsidered one by one only two mutually exclusive feelings must be\ntaken into account: full belief and full disbelief. The\n\u2018intermediate attitudes of partial belief\u2019, which he\nproposes to \u2018leave to the theory of probability\u2019 (1927a,\n[PP] 45), are discussed in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019. To\ndeal with attitudes held towards various atomic sentences at once,\nRamsey borrows from the former Wittgenstein the notion of\ntruth-possibility. When n atomic sentences are at play, there\nare 2n possible combinations of fully believing\nand fully disbelieving. Thus, \u2018the meaning of a sentence is\nagreement and disagreement with such and such\ntruth-possibilities\u2019 (op. cit., 46), and a proposition is\n\u2018a disjunction of the truth-possibilities with which [it]\nagrees\u2019 (op. cit., 47).\n\nThe third category of linguistic beliefs is general beliefs, i.e.\nthose whose expression involves the words \u2018all\u2019 and\n\u2018some\u2019. Concerning general propositions, Ramsey\nsuccessively held two different views. The first of these, explained\nin \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 (1927a) and \u2018Universals\nof Law and Fact\u2019 (1928b), is essentially the Tractarian view\nthat quantified sentences are conjunctions and disjunctions of atomic\npropositions (Sahlin 1990, 76; Dokic and Engel 2002, 30). The only\ndifference he found between conjunctions and disjunctions, on the one\nhand, and universal and particular sentences, on the other, was that\nthe arguments of genuine conjunctions and disjunctions can be\nenumerated, whereas the arguments of quantified sentences are given by\nmeans of propositional functions. These propositional functions show\ntheir usefulness in those cases in which either we do not know their\nparticular instances, or there are so many of them that enumerating\nthem is impossible. When such enumeration is logically possible we\nhave universals of fact; when it is not, we have universals of law.\nOne might think that the details that distinguish conjunctions,\ndisjunctions, and universals of fact from genuine general propositions\nwould vanish from the perspective of an omniscient subject who could\nentertain the totality of all application instances. Ramsey\nnevertheless rejects this idea because the role of general\npropositions is pragmatic, as an aid in the task of systematizing\n\u2018our knowledge as a deductive system\u2019 (1928b, [PP] 143),\nrather than semantic.\n\nThe second view appears in \u2018General Propositions and\nCausality\u2019 (1929b), and this is a fully pragmatist account\naccording to which general beliefs do not have a truth-value (Dokic\nand Engel 2002, 30; Sahlin 1990, 78). Here Ramsey presents his famous\naccount of atomic beliefs as maps: \u2018A belief of the primary\nsort\u2019, i.e. one without quantifiers, \u2018is a map of\nneighbouring space by which we steer\u2019 (1929b, [PP] 146). If\nbeliefs are maps of the neighbourhood, general beliefs \u2013\nunderstood as codifying general inferences \u2013 should be maps of\ninfinite extension, except that an infinite map is \u2018no longer a\nmap; we cannot take it in or steer by it. Our journey is over before\nwe need its remoter parts\u2019 (loc. cit.). Quantified sentences are\nthus \u2018rules for action or attitudes\u2019\n(Dokic and Engel 2002, 31), and express \u2018an inference we are at\nany time prepared to make\u2019 (1929b, [PP] 146). Dokic and Engel\n(2002) also stress the similarities between Ramsey\u2019s account of\ngeneral beliefs and Wittgenstein\u2019s view of laws as rules of\ninference.\n\nGeneral beliefs with general contents, \u2018variable\nhypotheticals\u2019 as Ramsey calls them, are not propositions at\nall. With respect to the role of general beliefs, Ramsey is prepared\nto explicitly endorse a central thesis of any pragmatist approach to\nmeaning: \u2018[m]any sentences express cognitive attitudes without\nbeing propositions\u2019 (1929b, [PP] 147). The cognitive attitude\nthey express is still belief, which in the case of general beliefs\nRamsey characterizes as composed of (i) a general enunciation, i.e.\nthe endorsement of a sentence that expresses it \u2013 \u2018all men\nare mortal\u2019, for instance \u2013 and (ii) \u2018a habit of\nsingular belief\u2019 (1929b, [PP] 148). These two steps are\nconnected by the psychological law that gives the meaning of\n\u2018all\u2019 (1929b, [PP] 149).\n4.2 Truth\n\nThe posthumously-published paper \u2018The Nature of Truth\u2019\n(1929c) is specifically devoted to the analysis of truth, and there\nRamsey develops the few lines about truth included in \u2018Facts and\nPropositions\u2019 (1927a). Even if that earlier paper mostly deals\nwith belief, the brief remarks it contains on truth are among\nRamsey\u2019s most influential contributions to philosophy. What he\nhas to say in there about truth is stated almost as \u2018an obvious\nfact\u2019 (Sahlin 1990, 56), hence his famous remark that\n\u2018there is really no separate problem of truth but merely a\nlinguistic muddle\u2019 (1927a, [PP] 38).\n\nIn \u2018The Nature of Truth\u2019 Ramsey explains that beliefs, in\nthe sense that is relevant here, are necessarily beliefs that\n\u2018something or other is so-and-so\u2019 (1929c, 7ff). He calls\nthis \u2018so-and-so\u2019 the \u2018propositional reference\u2019\n(loc. cit.) and uses it as the criterion of propositional\nindividuation, in the sense that if \u2018two men both believe that\nthe earth is flat we say they have the same belief\u2019 (loc. cit.).\nIndividuating beliefs by their propositional references might seem at\nodds with the pragmatist method given in terms of causes and effects\nthat Ramsey used in \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019. But this\nsuperficial tension is defused if propositional references, which are\nnot linguistic but conceptual, are individuated by their consequences\n(which include actions). Other mental states \u2013 doubts, desires,\nfears, regrets, etc. \u2013 have propositional references too, but\nonly beliefs have \u2018affirmative or assertive character\u2019\n(1929c, 8). Ramsey proposes to extend the ordinary meaning of the term\n\u2018belief\u2019 to cover mental states with any degree of\nassertive force \u2013 from mere conjecture to full certainty \u2013\nand propositional content. The contents of beliefs, in this extended\nsense, are the bearers of truth: \u2018Truth and falsity are ascribed\nprimarily to propositions\u2019, he says (1927a, [PP] 38). Later, he\nsubstitutes \u2018proposition\u2019 with \u2018propositional\nreference\u2019 (1929c, 7), but this rewording owes more to\nphilosophical precaution than any substantial change in view.\n\nTruth adds nothing substantive to the content of beliefs, according to\nRamsey. He claims that the meaning of truth is \u2018perfectly\nobvious, that anyone can see what it is and that difficulty\nonly arises when we try to say what it is, because it is\nsomething which ordinary language is rather ill-adapted to\nexpress\u2019 (1929c, 9). Because of this, Ramsey\u2019s view is\ngenerally interpreted as a redundancy theory of truth (Sahlin 1990,\n56\u201359; Dokic and Engel 2002, 18; Hookway 2005, 56\u201358), a\nkind of minimalism or deflationism about truth similar to the views\nput forward by Aristotle and Frege (cf. Sahlin 1990, 56), and later on\nby Tarski, Wittgenstein, Quine (cf. Hookway 2005, 57), Field and\nHorwich (cf. Koslow 2005, 106).\n\nNevertheless, there is more to Ramsey\u2019s view than what the label\n\u2018redundancy\u2019 suggests. The bearers of truth, i.e.\npropositions, can be referred to directly, as in \u2018that Caesar\nwas murdered\u2019, or identified by description, as in \u2018what\nshe said\u2019. Correspondingly, truth can be attached to the direct\nexpression of a proposition, as in \u2018It is true that Caesar was\nmurdered\u2019, or to a description, as in \u2018what she says is\ntrue\u2019. When truth applies to expressions of the first kind,\nRamsey characterizes its role as eliminable: \u2018it is evident that\n\u201cIt is true that Caesar was murdered\u201d means no more than\nthat Caesar was murdered, and \u201cIt is false that Caesar was\nmurdered\u201d means that Caesar was not murdered\u2019 (1927a,\n[PP], 38\u20139). But when the truth predicate applies to expressions\nof the second kind, Ramsey explicitly claims that it cannot be\ndispensed with: \u2018In the second case in which the proposition is\ndescribed and not given explicitly we have perhaps more of a problem,\nfor we get statements from which we cannot in ordinary language\neliminate the words \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d\u2019\n(loc. cit.).\n\nLet us consider the following three examples of truth ascriptions in\nEnglish:\n\n(4.1)  All Joan\u2019s\nthoughts are true.\n(4.2)  What follows\nfrom a true premise is true.\n(4.3)  Evolutionism is\ntrue.\n\n\nTo say what truth consists in, and deal with any kind of\ntruth ascription, Ramsey enriches ordinary English into English* by\nthe addition of single propositional variables \u2013\n\u2018p\u2019, \u2018q\u2019, etc., ranging over\nthe set of declarative sentences \u2013 and propositional\nquantifiers. In English* the truth predicate vanishes and its role is\ntaken over by propositional variables and quantifiers. The semi-formal\nsentences (4.1*)\u2013(4.3*) are translations of (4.1)\u2013(4.3)\ninto English*:\n\n(4.1*)  For all\np, if Joan thinks that p, p. \n(4.2*)  For all\np and q, if q follows from p, and\np, then q. \n(4.3*)  For all\np, if p follows from the theory of evolution, then\np. \n\n\nNote that the translation shows that the truth apparatus is redundant\nin English*, but not that it is redundant in English.\n\nThe definition of truth Ramsey provides in \u2018The Nature of\nTruth\u2019 is: \u2018A belief is true if it is a belief that\np, and p\u2019 (1929c, [OT] 9), where the first\ninstance of the propositional variable \u2018p\u2019\nrepresents the propositional reference that individuates the belief at\nissue (1929c, [OT] 7), and the second instance represents the\nobjective factor. This definition is expressed in English*, since\nordinary English does not have the necessary resources:\n\nAs we claim to have defined truth we ought to be able to substitute\nour definition for the word \u201ctrue\u201d wherever it occurs. But\nthe difficulty we have mentioned renders this impossible in ordinary\nlanguage which treats what should really be called\npro-sentences as if they were pro-nouns. [\u2026]\n\u201cthat\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d even when functioning as\nshort for sentences always require to be supplied with a verb: this\nverb is often \u201cis true\u201d and this peculiarity of language\ngives rise to artificial problems as to the nature of truth, which\ndisappear at once when they are expressed in logical symbolism, in\nwhich we can render \u201cwhat he believed is true\u201d by\n\u201cif p was what he believed, p\u201d (1929c,\n[OT] 10, his emphasis).\n\nThis text is possibly the first unequivocal expression of a\nprosentential theory of truth (Dokic and Engel 2002, 19;\nFr\u00e1polli 2005a, 113\u2013138; 2013, 61ff).\n\nRamsey (1929c, [OT] 9) anticipated a possible reaction to his use of\npropositional variables and to the translation of (4.1)\u2013(4.3) as\n(4.1*)\u2013(4.3*). The objection is the following:\n(4.1*)\u2013(4.3*) cannot be English* counterparts of English\nsentences because they are not well-formed. Free-standing instances,\nthe objection goes, of the variables \u2018p\u2019 and\n\u2018q\u2019 cannot fill the argument-slots of\ntruth-functions, such as conjunction and material implication, which\nneed complete sentences as arguments. Free-standing uses of the\nvariables in \u2018and p\u2019 and \u2018then\nq\u2019 would lack a verb to complete these clauses into\ngenuine instances of the grammatical category of sentences.\nRamsey\u2019s reply insists on the sentential status of the variables\n\u2018p\u2019 and \u2018q\u2019, which stand for\nitems that already contain a verb and express a truth-bearer (loc.\ncit.).\n\nWhat Ramsey did not anticipate was the classification of his view\neither as a redundancy or as a pro-sentential theory. On the contrary,\nhe thought that it would be interpreted as a correspondence theory of\ntruth, and although he did not accept the metaphysical commitments of\nthe many versions of correspondentism, he did not reject the label\neither. In fact, he acknowledges that truth is objective\ncorrespondence to the facts (see for instance 1929c, [OT] 11; 1929d,\n36). Dokic and Engel (2002, 25) point out that Ramsey was a realist\nabout truth conditions and also about truth, but this realism was\nmodulated by his pragmatism: \u2018his kind of realism is distinct\nfrom the kind of realism which underlies a full-blown correspondence\ntheory of truth. It is a form of pragmatic realism, which associates\ntruth to beliefs-habits and to actions.\u2019 Thus, Ramsey\u2019s\ntake on truth has a pragmatist background, but it is not a pragmatist\nview of truth. It is a kind of sophisticated redundancy theory that is\nrealist about truth conditions, and also includes some of the\ntechnical apparatus that prosentential theories developed later on\n(see Williams 1976, Grover 1992, Brandom 1994, Fr\u00e1polli\n2013).\n5. Conditionals\n\nIn \u201cGeneral Propositions and Causality\u201d (1929b) Ramsey\nmade some remarks about conditional judgements, which have influenced\nthinking about conditionals since the 1960s. Most famous is this\nfootnote:\n\nIf two people are arguing \u2018If \\(p\\), will \\(q\\)?\u2019 and are\nboth in doubt about \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically to\ntheir stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\);\n\u2026 they are fixing their degrees of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\).\n(1929b, [FM] 247)\n\n\nTo understand what Ramsey means by \u201cdegree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)\u201d we need to turn to his earlier essay \u201cTruth\nand Probability\u201d (1926a), where he develops an interpretation of\nprobability as the logic of partial belief ([FM] 157). (Note, Ramsey\ndid not take this to be the only notion of probability: \u201cThe\nconclusions we shall come to as to the meaning of probability in Logic\nmust not \u2026 be taken as prejudging its meaning in physics\u201d\n(ibid.). The editor adds that a final chapter, on probability in\nscience, was designed but not written.) Here he introduces a\n\u201cvery useful new idea \u2013 \u2018the degree of belief in\n\\(q\\) given \\(p\\)\u2019\u201d (1926a, [FM] 180). One of his basic\nlaws is:\n\nDegree of belief in (\\(p\\) and \\(q\\)) = degree of belief in \\(p\\)\n\u00d7 degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) (1926a, [FM] 181)\n\n\nAs a law of probability, this was not new. It was in use since the\neighteenth century. It is needed to answer a compulsory question: how\nlikely is it that two events will happen? Answer: it is the\nprobability of the first, multiplied by the probability of the second\non the supposition that the first happens. What was novel in\nRamsey\u2019s essay was the interpretation of probability as degree\nof belief; and what was novel in the 1929 paper (1929b) was the\nlinking of \u201cdegree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)\u201d with\nour ordinary, typically uncertain, conditional judgements.\n\nExplaining \u201cdegree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)\u201d, Ramsey\nsays \u201cIt roughly expresses the odds at which [the subject] would\nnow bet on \\(q\\), the bet only to be valid if \\(p\\) is true\u201d\n(1926a, [FM] 180). Ramsey was aware that the link between degrees of\nbelief and betting behaviour is imperfect (1926a, [FM] 170). Here the\nmessage is that a conditional degree of belief is to a\nconditional bet, as an unconditional degree of belief is to\nan unconditional bet. For a bet on \\(q\\), you ask yourself, which is\nmore likely and by how much, \\(q\\) or \\(\\neg q\\)? For a bet on \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\), you ask yourself, which is more likely, and by how much,\n\\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), or \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\)? If you judge \\(p\n\\:\\&\\: q\\) much more likely than \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), you have\na high degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). Equivalently, under the\nhypothesis or supposition that \\(p\\), you judge it to be likely that\n\\(q\\).\n\nRamsey then warns against some possible misunderstandings of\n\u201cdegree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)\u201d, which will be\ndiscussed below.\n\nThe main business of \u201cGeneral Propositions and Causality\u201d\nis to discuss the nature of causal generalisations, also called\nvariable hypotheticals \u2013 and naturally this leads him to discuss\ntheir singular conditional instances. He argues that \u201cvariable\nhypotheticals are not judgements but rules for judging \u2018If I\nmeet a \\(\\phi\\) I shall treat it as a \\(\\psi\\)\u2019. This cannot be\nnegated, but it can be disagreed with by one who\ndoes not adopt it\u201d (1929b, [FM] 241, italics original). There is\nemphasis throughout on the idea that these conditional judgements are\nnot propositions. After an example in which \\(A\\) says \u201cIf I eat\nthe pie I will get a stomach-ache\u201d and \\(B\\) disagrees, Ramsey\nwrites:\n\nMany sentences express cognitive attitudes without being propositions;\nand the difference between saying yes and no to them is not the\ndifference between saying yes or no to a proposition. This is even\ntrue of the ordinary hypothetical (as can be seen from the last\nexample, it asserts something for the case in which the [antecedent]\nis true: we apply the Law of Excluded Middle not to the whole thing\nbut to the [consequent] only). (1929b, [FM] 239\u2013240)\n\n\nLater, with the same example, \u201cit is not that he believes [a\nproposition] \\(p\\), we \\(\\overline{p}\\); but he has a different degree\nof belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) from ours; and we can obviously try to\nconvert him to our view\u201d (1929b, [FM] 247, followed by the\nfamous footnote). Here is another passage:\n\n\nWhen we deliberate about a possible action, we ask ourselves what will\nhappen if we do this or that. If we give a definite answer of the form\n\u2018If I do \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result\u2019, this can be properly\nregarded as a material implication or disjunction \u2018Either not\n\\(p\\), or \\(q\\)\u2019. But it differs, of course from any ordinary\ndisjunction in that one of its members is not something of which we\nare trying to discover the truth, but something within our power to\nmake true or false. \u2026\n\nBesides definite answers \u2018If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result\u2019, we\noften get ones \u2018If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) might result\u2019 or\n\u2018\\(q\\) would probably result\u2019. Here the degree of\nprobability is not a degree of belief in \u2018Not-\\(p\\) or\n\\(q\\)\u2019, but a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), which it is\nevidently possible to have without a definite degree of belief in\n\\(p\\), \\(p\\) not being an intellectual problem. And our conduct is\nlargely determined by these degrees of hypothetical belief. (1929b,\n[FM] 246)\n\n\nTwo observations are in order: first, in the case of certainty that if\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), provided that \\(A\\) does not have probability 0, degree\nof belief in the material conditional and the conditional degree of\nbelief in \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) coincide. Writing \u201c\\(\\bel\\)\u201d\nfor degree of belief: if \\(\\bel(A \\amp \\neg B\\)) = 0 but \\(\\bel(A)\n\\neq 0\\), both \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) = 1\\) and \\(\\bel(B \\given A) = 1.\\)\nThe only other case in which they coincide is if \\(\\bel(A) = 1.\\)\nOtherwise, \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) \\gt \\bel(B \\given A),\\) radically so\nwhen \\(\\bel(B \\given A)\\) is low but \\(\\bel(\\neg A)\\) is high. Second,\nit is clear that Ramsey does not reductively define conditional degree\nof belief in terms of the ratio: \\(\\bel(A \\amp B)/\\bel(A),\\) for the\nconditional degree of belief can be assessed even without any specific\nvalue for \\(\\bel(A).\\) Indeed, in the fundamental law stated above,\nthe right-hand side is much more use as a route to the probability of\na conjunction, rather than the other way round.\n\nRamsey does not treat counterfactual conditionals in terms of\nconditional degrees of belief. The famous footnote continues:\n\nIf \\(p\\) turns out false, these degrees of belief are rendered\nvoid. If either party believes \u00ac\\(p\\) for certain, the\nquestion ceases to mean anything to him except as a question about\nwhat follows from certain laws or hypotheses.\n\n\nThat is, a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) exists only when the\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) is non-zero. Ramsey does make a few remarks\nabout counterfactuals, noticing the \u2018subtle syntactic\nvariations\u2019. For instance, \u201cIf he was there, he must have\nvoted for it (for it was passed unanimously), but if he had been\nthere, he would have voted against it (such being his nature)\u201d\n(1929b, [FM] 249). (Here we have an early precursor of the\nOswald-Kennedy pair: if Oswald didn\u2019t do it, someone else did;\nbut if Oswald hadn\u2019t done it, no one else would have; see Adams\n1970.) There are a few remarks about counterfactuals in Ramsey\u2019s\npaper but no settled view of them is presented.\n\nBruno de Finetti (1937, based on lectures of 1935), shortly after\nRamsey and independently, also developed an account of probability as\ndegree of belief. (Unlike Ramsey, de Finetti argued that this was the\nonly kind of probability.) In a separate lecture (1936) he gave a\ntheory of \u201cconditional events\u201d or \u201ctri-events\u201d\nas he called them. Like Ramsey, he provided an account of conditional\njudgements in terms of conditional probabilities, and gave a\nthree-valued account of such a conditional \u201cif \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)\u201d: true if \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), false if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg\nq\\), void if \\(\\neg p\\). He also connects this with conditional bets:\nwon if \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), lost if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), called off\nif \\(\\neg p\\). He gives three-valued truth tables for the other\nconnectives when applied to conditionals, and claims that the\nprobability of a \u201ctri-event\u201d is the probability of its\ntruth given that it has a truth value \u2013 which, in the case of\n\u201cif \\(p\\), \\(q\\)\u201d is just the probability of \\(q\\) given\n\\(p\\). The results for more complex sentences are controversial, but\nthere has been a fair amount of work in this tradition, much of it\nsummarised by Peter Milne (1997). It is interesting that this second\nexposition of probability as degree of belief also connected\nconditional degree of belief to ordinary conditional judgements, and\nalso recognised that the latter could not then be treated as ordinary\npropositions.\n\nErnest Adams wrote two papers (1965, 1966), and later a book (1975)\ndeveloping a logic for conditionals assessed as conditional\nprobabilities. Like Ramsey, he was sceptical of the idea of\nconditionals as propositions with truth conditions, and developed a\nlogic based on probability. He showed that valid arguments have an\ninteresting probability-preserving property: the uncertainty (i.e. 1\n\u2212 the probability) of the conclusion cannot exceed the sum of\nthe uncertainties of the premises. He applied this criterion to\narguments with conditionals, and an interesting logic emerged. The\nparadoxes of material implication are invalid. Specifically, with\nmaterial implication, \\(\\neg A\\) guarantees the truth of \\(A \\to B\\).\nBut here, the probability of \\(\\neg A\\) can be high while the\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is low. (\\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is the\nanalog of \\(A \\to B\\).) More surprisingly, there are counterexamples\nto transitivity, contraposition, and strengthening of the antecedent\n(see Section 3.2 of the entry on\n indicative conditionals,\n for examples and more details).\n\nRobert Stalnaker\u2019s first paper on the subject, \u201cA Theory\nof Conditionals\u201d, appeared in 1968. Stalnaker refers to Ramsey.\nHe also mentions Adams (1966) in a footnote, and indicates that he\nwill devote another paper to the probabilistic aspects of the theory.\nThis is his \u201cProbability and Conditionals\u201d (1970), and its\nabstract announces that \u201cconditional propositions are introduced\nas propositions whose absolute probability is equal to the conditional\nprobability of the consequent given the antecedent\u201d. Then David\nLewis (1976) proved that there is no proposition the probability of\nwhose truth can be systematically equated with the conditional\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) \u2013 a result which Ramsey and de\nFinetti appear to have foreseen.\n\nProbability is not discussed in the 1968 paper, but Adams\u2019s\nlogic is in the background as a guide: it turns out that\nStalnaker\u2019s logic coincides with Adams over their common domain\n(Adams puts aside sentences in which conditionals are embedded in\nother connectives). Thus, for example, Stalnaker also has the\ncounterexamples to transitivity, contraposition and strengthening of\nthe antecedent (1968, 48\u20139).\n\nStalnaker puts Ramsey\u2019s suggestion thus: \u201cadd the\nantecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of knowledge (or beliefs),\nand then consider whether the consequent is true. Your belief about\nthe conditional should be the same as your hypothetical belief, under\nthis condition, in the consequent\u201d (1968, 43).\n\nStalnaker was interested in a theory which covered both indicative\nconditionals and counterfactual conditionals. He held that something\nsimilar happened with the latter:\n\n\nFirst, add the antecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of beliefs;\nsecond, make whatever adjustments are required to maintain consistency\n(without modifying the hypothetical belief in the antecedent);\nfinally, consider whether the consequent is then true.\n\n\u2026 Now we have found an answer to the question, \u201cHow do we\ndecide whether or not to believe a conditional statement?\u201d the\nproblem is to make the transition from belief conditions to truth\nconditions; that is, to find a set of truth conditions for statements\nhaving conditional form which explains why we use the method we do use\nto evaluate them. The concept of a possible world is just\nwhat we need to make this transition, since a possible world is the\nanalogue of a stock of hypothetical beliefs. The following set of\ntruth conditions, using this notion, is a first approximation to the\naccount that I shall propose:\n\nConsider a possible world in which \\(A\\) is true, and which otherwise\ndiffers minimally from the actual world. \u201cIf A, then\nB\u201d is true (false) just in case B is\ntrue (false) in that possible world.\n(44\u201345, italics original)\n\n\nAnd close-possible-world semantics for conditionals was born.\n\nA consequence of Stalnaker\u2019s setting the probabilistic\nconsiderations aside in his influential 1968 paper is that\nRamsey\u2019s idea came to be taken differently: it was applied in\nthe context of full, all-or-nothing belief; it was applied to\ncounterfactuals as well as indicatives; and consequently, there was\nmuch emphasis on belief revision. The phrase \u201cthe\nRamsey Test\u201d was coined by William Harper (1975, 1976), and it\ncaught on. He explains it thus: \u201cAccept \u2018if \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)\u2019 if and only if the minimum revision of your system of\nbeliefs needed to accept \\(A\\) also requires accepting \\(B\\)\u201d\n(1975, 245; 1976, 118). Peter G\u00e4rdenfors (1986, 81) says the\nsame. Sven Ove Hansson (1992) says \u201cIn modern studies of belief\ndynamics, the Ramsey test is taken to \u2018presume \u2026 some\nmethod of revising states of belief\u2019 [quoting G\u00e4rdenfors].\nThus \u2018If \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)\u2019 is taken to be believed if and\nonly if \\(q\\) would be believed in the belief state that would result\nfrom revising the present belief state by \\(p\\)\u201d (1992, 522).\nStephen Read says \u201cRamsey\u2019s idea was simple, but\nappealing. One should believe a conditional \u2018If \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)\u2019 if one would come to believe \\(B\\) if one were to add\n\\(A\\) to one\u2019s stock of beliefs\u201d (1995, 47).\n\nThis emphasis on belief revision is not found in\nRamsey\u2019s work. Indeed, he distances himself from that idea. On\nthe page where he introduces \u201cdegree of belief in \\(q\\) given\n\\(p\\)\u201d, Ramsey writes:\n\nThis does not mean the degree of belief which the subject would have\nin \\(q\\) is he knew \\(p\\), or that which he ought to have. \u2026\n[And again] This is not the same as the degree he would believe \\(q\\),\nif he believed \\(p\\) for certain; for knowledge of \\(p\\) might for\npsychological reasons profoundly alter his whole system of beliefs.\n(1926a, [FM] 180)\n\n\nThus, for Ramsey conditional degree of belief is a synchronic notion,\nnot a diachronic one. It is a feature of one\u2019s present\nbelief-state, not to be defined in terms of how one\u2019s\nbelief-state would change on acquiring more information.\n\nWhy did Ramsey issue these warnings? Here is one example which may be\nwhat he had in mind. Mary is an atheist. However, if she were to learn\nthat she had a fatal disease, she would acquire a belief in God. But\nshe doesn\u2019t now believe \u201cIf I get a fatal disease, there\nis a God\u201d! Another example: I am about to pick a card and look\nat it. I know there are three kings in the pile, two red and one\nblack. My conditional degree of belief that I pick a red card, given\nthat I pick a king, is 2/3. That determines the odds on which I would\nbet on Red given King. But if I do pick a king, I won\u2019t have a\ndegree of belief 2/3 that it is red. I am not colour blind. Then there\nexamples like Lewis\u2019s \u201cIf Reagan was in the pay of the\nKGB, we\u2019ll never find out\u201d. This is something he believes.\nBut if he were to learn the antecedent, he would not then believe the\nconsequent! As Lewis says, \u201cIt might be no easy thing to judge\nwhat would be learned if [\\(A\\)] were learned, in view of the variety\nof ways that something might be learned\u201d (1986, 156). He\nconcludes that a conditional degree of belief is a good but fallible\nguide to the degree of belief you would have in \\(B\\) if you learned\n\\(A\\). Edgington\u2019s (1995) reply to Read, \u00a71, discusses the\ndisparity between what Ramsey himself said, and much that goes under\nthe name \u201cthe Ramsey Test\u201d. In the famous footnote, Ramsey\nspeaks of people \u201cadding \\(p\\) hypothetically to their\nstock of knowledge\u201d \u2013 that is, supposing that \\(p\\). The\nconsequences of doing so for one\u2019s conditional beliefs, is not\ninvariably equivalent to the consequences of coming to believe \\(p\\),\nfor one\u2019s unconditional beliefs.\n\nMany philosophers have followed the path along which Ramsey took the\nfirst steps, and Adams developed \u2013 of understanding our\ntypically uncertain conditional judgements in terms of conditional\ndegrees of belief (see Edgington 2014 for more details and\nreferences).\n6. Partial Belief and Subjective Probability\n\nIn \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 (1926a), Ramsey sets out an\ninfluential account of the nature, measurement, and norms of partial\nbelief. The essay is a pioneering work on subjectivist\ninterpretations of probability (also known as personalist\ninterpretations; see the entry on\n interpretations of probability).\n According to subjectivism, probabilities can be interpreted as\nnumerical representations of an individual\u2019s subjective degrees\nof confidence. First written in 1926 and still incomplete at the time\nof its publication in 1931 (a year after Ramsey\u2019s death),\n\u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 was not very widely discussed\nuntil after the publication of Savage\u2019s The Foundations of\nStatistics (1954), at which time subjectivism came to prominence.\nMany of the key ideas and arguments original to the essay have\nreappeared in later foundational works in the subjectivist tradition\n(e.g., de Finetti 1937, Savage 1954, Jeffrey 1965). This section\noutlines some of Ramsey\u2019s major contributions to this tradition,\nfocusing primarily on the procedure he suggests for measuring\nsubjective probability.\n\nRamsey\u2019s central goal in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 is\nto show that the laws of probability provide us with a \u2018logic of\npartial belief\u2019. That is, the laws specify necessary conditions\non any consistent set of partial beliefs, in a manner analogous to how\nthe laws of classical logic might be taken to generate necessary\nconditions on any consistent set of full beliefs. The argument for\nthis claim is grounded in Ramsey\u2019s subjectivist approach to\nprobability. The essay begins, however, with a discussion of the two\nmajor approaches to understanding probabilities at the time in\nCambridge: frequentism, and a version of the logical interpretation\nput forward by the economist John Maynard Keynes in A Treatise on\nProbability (1921).\n\nRegarding frequentism \u2013 according to which the probability of an\nevent is the relative frequency with which that type of event occurs,\nor would occur, over repeated trials \u2013 Ramsey adopts a\nconciliatory tone. For many cases (e.g., coin flips and rolls of a\ndie), frequencies provide a natural interpretation of the probability\ncalculus, but they are insufficiently general for Ramsey\u2019s\npurposes and relate not to the consistency of partial beliefs but to\ntheir reasonableness. (We\u2019ll return to the role of frequencies\nin Ramsey\u2019s theory below.) On the other hand, Ramsey presents a\ndetailed critique of Keynes\u2019 theory. According to Keynes,\nprobabilities are an objective and quantifiable relation between\npropositions \u2013 roughly, the probability of an hypothesis \\(h\\),\ngiven evidence \\(e\\), is the degree to which \\(h\\) is logically\nimplied by \\(e\\). Importantly, Keynes\u2019 assumed that this\nrelation could be perceived through intuition \u2013 to which Ramsey\nobjects:\n\n\n[T]here really do not seem to be any such things as the probability\nrelations [Keynes] describes. He supposes that, at any rate in certain\ncases, they can be perceived; but speaking for myself I feel confident\nthat this is not true. I do not perceive them\u2026 moreover I\nshrewdly suspect that others do not perceive them either, because they\nare able to come to so very little agreement as to which of them\nrelates any two given propositions. (1926a, [FM] 161)\n\n\nFor example, for even very simple pairs of propositions (such as\n\u2018This is red\u2019 and \u2018That is blue\u2019), where one\nmight have expected objective relations to be more readily accessible,\nthere is very little agreement as to what probability relation might\nconnect them. Ramsey also notes that, while most people will agree\nthat the probability of a fair coin landing heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n\u2018we can none of us say exactly what is the evidence which forms\nthe other term for the probability relation about which we are then\njudging\u2019 (1926a, [FM] 162).\n\nHaving dismissed Keynes\u2019 theory, Ramsey moves on to his\nalternative, subjectivist view. The guiding idea throughout is\nthat:\n\n\n[T]he degree of a belief is a causal property of it, which we can\nexpress vaguely as the extent to which we are prepared to act on it.\n(1926a, [FM] 169)\n\n\nThat is, partial beliefs are connected to choice and action, in that\nthe more confidence one has in a proposition \\(p\\), the more willing\none will be to choose those options that lead to favourable outcomes\nunder the assumption that \\(p\\) is true. Although he does not say much\nabout the nature of this connection in \u2018Truth and\nProbability,\u2019 in \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 (1927a,\n170) Ramsey expresses sympathy for the pragmatist view according to\nwhich a full belief that \\(p\\) just is a set of actions that\ntends to lead to favourable outcomes at worlds where \\(p\\) is\ntrue:\n\n\nIt is, for instance, possible to say that a chicken believes a certain\nsort of caterpillar to be poisonous, and mean by that merely that it\nabstains from eating such caterpillars on account of unpleasant\nexperiences connected with them. The mental factors in such a belief\nwould be parts of the chicken\u2019s behaviour\u2026 Thus any set\nof actions for whose utility \\(p\\) is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition might be called a belief that \\(p\\)\u2026 (1927a, [FM]\n144)\n\n\nIt is plausible that Ramsey intended a similar account for partial\nbeliefs \u2013 that partial beliefs either are patterns of\nbehaviour, or perhaps behavioural dispositions, or that they\u2019re\notherwise definable primarily in terms of such things. In any case,\nRamsey recognised that, if this vague connection between belief and\nchoice could be suitably precisified, then it could be used to build a\ndefinition of degrees of belief in terms of choices.\n\nLike other quantities throughout the sciences, Ramsey argues,\n\u2018the degree of a belief\u2026 has no precise meaning unless we\nspecify more exactly how it is to be measured\u2019 (1926a, [FM]\n167). To precisify his account, therefore, Ramsey sketches a procedure\nfor the measurement of partial belief, which includes as an initial\npart also the measurement of desires (or \u2018utilities\u2019). The\nprocedure takes as input the subject\u2019s preferences over\n\nworlds, or more accurately propositions that are\nmaximally specific with respect to matters the subject cares about,\nand\ngambles, including especially binary gambles of the form\n\u2018world \\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\), and world \\(\\omega_2\\)\notherwise\u2019, and ternary gambles of the form \u2018\\(\\omega_1\\)\nif \\(p \\amp q\\), \\(\\omega_2\\) if \\(p \\amp \\neg{q}\\), and \\(\\omega_3\\)\notherwise\u2019.\n\n\nWith those as inputs, the procedure supplies precise numerical\nrepresentations of her partial beliefs and utilities provided the\nagents\u2019 preferences satisfy a number of \u2018coherence\u2019\nrequirements. The procedure can be roughly summarised as follows.\nFirst, we elicit the subject\u2019s preferences by offering her a\nsequence of choices between pairs of worlds and/or gambles. Then, on\nthe assumption that the subject is an expected utility maximiser, we\ncan use her preferences to determine her numerical utilities. Given\nher utilities, we can finally define the subject\u2019s degree of\nbelief towards the proposition \\(p\\) in terms of her utilities for\ngambles conditional on \\(p\\). The following paragraphs will briefly\ndiscuss these three steps in turn. More thorough treatments of\nRamsey\u2019s procedure can be found in Sahlin 1990, Bradley 2001,\nand Elliott 2017; see also Neth 2019 for an extension of the Ramseyan\nprocedure beyond expected utility theory.\n\nRegarding the first step, which requires us to elicit the\nsubject\u2019s preferences, Ramsey says:\n\n\n[Suppose] that our subject has certain beliefs about everything; then\nhe will act so that what he believes to be the total consequences of\nhis action will be the best possible. If then we had the power of the\nAlmighty, and could persuade our subject of our power, we could, by\noffering him options, discover how he placed in order of merit all\npossible courses of the world\u2026 Suppose next that the subject is\ncapable of doubt; then we could test his degree of belief in different\npropositions by making him offers of the following kind. Would you\nrather have world [\\(\\omega_1\\)] in any event; or world [\\(\\omega_2\\)]\nif \\(p\\) is true, and world [\\(\\omega_3\\)] if \\(p\\) is false? (1926a,\n[FM] 177)\n\n\nA common objection to this early stage of the procedure is that if the\nexperimenter were to convince their subject that they \u2018had the\npower of the Almighty\u2019, then this would radically alter the\nbeliefs supposedly being measured (e.g., Jeffrey 1983, 158\u201360;\ncf. Sobel 1998, 255\u20136; Bradley 2001, \u00a73.2; Eriksson &\nRabinowicz 2013). A measurement procedure can be considered accurate\nonly if it doesn\u2019t itself significantly alter the measurand.\nMeasurement procedures usually involve some unavoidable\nchange to the quantity being measured \u2013 placing a cold\nthermometer into a hot liquid will slightly cool the liquid, for\nexample, but for most purposes this effect is negligible. The\nobjection at hand is therefore that merely having the subject come\nto believe that they have some choice over these worlds and\ngambles will generally involve a substantial change to their\nbeliefs \u2013 enough to undermine the accuracy of Ramsey\u2019s\nprocedure. For example, the process might alter the subject\u2019s\nbeliefs regarding the claim \u2018Experimenters have the capacity to\nmake it the case that \\(\\omega_1\\) obtains if \\(p\\) is true, and\n\\(\\omega_2\\) obtains otherwise\u2019, with potentially many ripple on\neffects through to her other beliefs. Interestingly, Ramsey makes note\nof a similar problem for an alternative procedure (1926a, [FM] 170),\nthough does not discuss the worry as it arises for his own\nproposal.\n\nThe second step of Ramsey\u2019s procedure takes us from preferences\nto utilities. This step is the most complicated, and it requires a\nsuite of background assumptions about the partial beliefs, utilities,\nand preferences of the subject. In his words,\n\n\nI propose to take as a basis a general psychological theory, which is\nnow universally discarded, but nevertheless comes, I think, fairly\nclose to the truth in the sort of cases with which we are most\nconcerned. I mean the theory that we act in the way we think most\nlikely to realize the objects of our desires, so that a person\u2019s\nactions are completely determined by his desires and opinions. (1926a,\n[FM] 174)\n\n\nRamsey\u2019s point here is that, given some background psychological\nassumptions, it will be possible \u2013 at least sometimes \u2013 to\nspecify exactly what a subject\u2019s degrees of belief and\nutilities are once we have enough information about her preferences.\nHowever, Ramsey leaves the details of this \u2018general\npsychological theory\u2019 almost entirely implicit. We can clarify\nmatters on his behalf by breaking the theory into three parts:\n\nFirst, there exists a function \\(\\varphi\\) that associates gambles\nwith real numbers, such that the subject weakly prefers a gamble\n\\(\\gamma_1\\) to another gamble \\(\\gamma_2\\) just in case\n\\(\\varphi(\\gamma_1)\\geq\\varphi(\\gamma_2)\\)\nSecond, this function \\(\\varphi\\) \u2018decomposes\u2019 into\ntwo further real-valued functions \\(\\bel\\) and \\(des,\\) in the sense\nthat if \\(\\gamma\\) is the binary gamble \n\u2018\\(\\omega_1\\) if\n\\(p\\), \\(\\omega_2\\)\nif \\(\\neg{p}\\)\u2019 then\n\\(\\varphi(\\gamma) =\nbel(p){\\cdot}des(\\omega_1\\&{}p) +\n(1-bel(p)){\\cdot}des(\\omega_2\\&\\neg{}p)\\)\n(and likewise for ternary gambles, mutatis\n  mutandis)\nThird, \\(bel\\) and \\(des\\) represent the subject\u2019s\npartial beliefs and utilities respectively; for instance,\n\\(bel(p)\\geq\\bel(q)\\) just in case the subject\u2019s degree of\nbelief towards \\(p\\) is at least as great as their degree of belief\ntowards \\(q\\), and likewise \\(des(p)\\geq{}des(q)\\) just in case the\nsubject desires that \\(p\\) at least as much as they desire that\n\\(q\\)\n\n\nIn other words, Ramsey assumes that our preferences conform to the\nrule of expected utility maximisation, where the expected\nutility of a gamble is given by the weighted average of the utilities\nof its outcomes, the weights being provided by the subject\u2019s\ndegrees of belief. While Ramsey recognised that these assumptions\ninvolve some idealisation, he justifies them by noting that the\ndevelopment of any measurement process \u2018cannot be accomplished\nwithout introducing a certain amount of hypothesis or fiction\u2019\n(1926a, [FM] 168), and that the assumptions come close enough to the\ntruth to render them still useful (1926a, [FM] 173).\n\nThe reasoning by which we go from preferences to a numerical\nrepresentation of utilities is complicated, and in Ramsey\u2019s\npaper mostly left unstated. It begins with the notion of an\nethically neutral proposition, which can here be defined\nas:\n\nEthical Neutrality: \\(p\\) is ethically\nneutral for a subject iff, for all worlds \\(\\omega\\) consistent\nwith \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg{p}\\), the subject is indifferent between\n\\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega \\amp p\\), and \\(\\omega \\amp \\neg{p}\\).\n\nThat is, a proposition \\(p\\) is ethically neutral if the truth or\nfalsity of \\(p\\) is a matter of indifference to the subject,\nregardless of the wider context in which its truth or falsity obtains.\nHaving characterised ethical neutrality in terms of preferences,\nRamsey uses it to construct a definition (in terms of preferences over\ngambles) for when the difference in utility between two\nworlds \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is equal to the\ndifference in utility between \\(\\omega_3\\) and\n \\(\\omega_4\\).[2]\n This equal differences in utility definition provides Ramsey\nwith the resources needed to sketch a representation theorem,\nwhich constitutes the centrepiece of his paper. According to this\ntheorem, the subject\u2019s preferences over worlds and gambles will\nsatisfy eight relatively simple conditions (or \u2018axioms\u2019)\nonly if there exists at least one function, \\(des\\), which represents\nthe subject\u2019s preferences over worlds in the sense that\n\\(\\omega_1\\) is weakly preferred to \\(\\omega_2\\) if and only if\n\\(des(\\omega_1) \\geq des(\\omega_2)\\). Moreover, this function will be \nunique up to positive linear transformations \u2013 that is, for any\nother function \\(des^*\\) with the same property, \\(des^*(x) =\ndes(x)r+c \\) (for some positive real number \\(r\\) and constant \\(c\\)).\nAs such, \\(des\\) is an interval scale representation:\na numerical scale in which intervals of differences are\nmeaningful. For instance, the difference in utility between\n\\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is at least as great as that between\n\\(\\omega_3\\) and \\(\\omega_4\\) just in case \\(des(\\omega_1) -\ndes(\\omega_2) \\geq des(\\omega_3) - des(\\omega_4) \\). (Other examples\nof interval scales include temperatures as measured in degrees Celsius\nor Fahrenheit, and yearly dates as measured in the A.D. and Buddhist\nor Hindu systems.) Given Ramsey\u2019s background \u2018general\npsychological theory\u2019, the implication is that the\nsubject\u2019s preferences will satisfy Ramsey\u2019s eight axioms\nonly if this function \\(des\\) represents her utilities on an interval\nscale.\n\nIncluded among Ramsey\u2019s eight axioms are some obvious coherence\nconditions, such as that preferences ought to be transitive. But the\naxioms also include some less obvious conditions, for instance that\nfor any pair of worlds \\(\\omega_1\\), \\(\\omega_2\\), there\u2019s a\nfurther world \\(\\omega_3\\) whose utility is exactly halfway between\nthat of \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\). There has been very little\nempirical investigation into Ramsey\u2019s axioms, primarily due to\nthe widespread opinion that his representation result has been\nsuperseded by the results of Savage (1954) and later decision\ntheorists (see, e.g., Fishburn 1981). However, Ramsey\u2019s\nassumption that there exists an ethically neutral proposition (needed\nfor the definition of equal differences in utility to make sense) has\nattracted substantial critical discussion. Ramsey does not discuss any\nreasons to believe that even one ethically neutral proposition exists,\nstill less that their existence is a precondition for the\nconsistency of partial beliefs. For more discussion,\nincluding on why ethically neutral propositions are problematic for\nRamsey\u2019s proposal and whether they\u2019re necessary for it,\nsee Sobel 1998, Bradley 2001, Eriksson & H\u00e1jek 2007, and\nElliott 2017. A further question concerns whether this stage of\nRamsey\u2019s procedure presupposes the controversial\n\u2018deliberation crowds out prediction\u2019 thesis, according to\nwhich an agent deliberating about an action cannot have meaningful\ndegrees of belief regarding whether she will perform that action; see\nLiu & Price (2020) for discussion and Rabinowicz (2002) for a\ncritique of the thesis.\n\nThe third and final stage of Ramsey\u2019s measurement procedure\ntakes us from the subject\u2019s utilities to a definition of her\ndegrees of belief:\n\n\nHaving thus defined a way of measuring value we can now derive a way\nof measuring belief in general. If the option of [\\(\\omega_2\\)] for\ncertain is indifferent with that of [\u2018\\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\),\n\\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise\u2019], we can define the subject\u2019s\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) as the ratio of the difference between\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] and [\\(\\omega_3\\)] to that between [\\(\\omega_1\\)] and\n[\\(\\omega_3\\)]. (1926a, [FM] 179)\n\n\nIn a footnote, Ramsey adds that \\(\\omega_1\\) must imply \\(p\\), and\n\\(\\omega_3\\) must imply \\(\\neg{p}\\). The definition follows from the\nbackground assumption of the \u2018general psychological\ntheory\u2019 mentioned above: the world \\(\\omega_2\\) has the same\nutility as the gamble \u2018\\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\), \\(\\omega_3\\)\notherwise\u2019 just in case \n\\[des(\\omega_2) = bel(p)des(\\omega_1) + (1 - bel(p))des(\\omega_3)\\]\n\n\nWhere \\(des(\\omega_1) \\neq des(\\omega_3)\\), this equality can be\nrearranged to give a definition of \\(bel(p)\\)as follows:\n\n\\[bel(p) = \\frac{des(\\omega_2) - des(\\omega_3)}{des(\\omega_1) - des(\\omega_3)}\\]\n\n\nAs Ramsey notes,\n\n\nThis amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief in \\(p\\) by the\nodds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet being conducted\nin terms of differences of value as defined. (1926a, [FM]\n179\u201380)\n\n\nRamsey\u2019s definition of conditional probability (1926a, [FM] 180)\nfollows an essentially similar strategy. Having thus outlined his\nstrategy for defining degrees of belief, Ramsey proves that from his\npreference conditions and subsequent definitions, the following\n\u2018laws of probability\u2019 follow: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n&bel(p) + bel(\\neg p) = 1\\\\\n &bel(p \\,|\\, q) + \\bel(\\neg p \\,|\\, q) = 1\\\\\n &bel(p \\amp q) = bel(p)bel(q \\,|\\, p)\\\\\n &bel(p \\amp q) + bel(p \\amp \\neg q) = bel(p)\\\\\n &bel(p \\,\\vee\\, q) = bel(p) + bel(q), \\text{where }p\\amp q\\text{ is impossible} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nRamsey goes on to say:\n\n\nThese are the laws of probability, which we have proved to be\nnecessarily true of any consistent set of degrees of belief. Any\ndefinite set of degrees of belief which broke them would be\ninconsistent in the sense that it violated the laws of preference\nbetween options\u2026 (1926a, [FM] 182)\n\n\nIn this passage we find an early version of what has come to be known\nas a representation theorem argument for probabilistic norms\non partial belief and for expected utility theory, of the kind later\nmade popular by Savage. (See also Skyrms 1987, Hajek 2008, and the\nentry on\n normative theories of rational choice: expected utility,\n \u00a72.2, for discussion). It is dubious, however, that Ramsey\n\u2018proved\u2019 that the stated laws must be true of any\nconsistent set of partial beliefs, even where\n\u2018consistency\u2019 is understood as being tied to the\n\u2018laws of preference\u2019 in the manner that Ramsey suggests.\nAmong the axioms of his representation theorem are some (like those\nregarding the ethically neutral proposition) which are not plausible\nas conditions of the consistency on those preferences.\nFurthermore, Ramsey\u2019s \u2018proof\u2019 requires substantive\npsychological assumptions about the connection between partial beliefs\nand preferences, which Ramsey admits are idealizations. Even if those\nassumptions happen to be true as a matter of fact, though, or close to\nthe truth, they are presupposed in the derivation and require\nindependent justification.\n\nImmediately following, Ramsey also states that:\n\n\nIf anyone\u2019s mental condition violated these laws, his choice\nwould depend on the precise form in which the options were offered\nhim, which would be absurd. He could have a book made against him by a\ncunning better and would then stand to lose in any event. (1926a, [FM]\n182)\n\n\nThe reasoning behind this claim is never made explicit, though it is\nevident that Ramsey was putting forward what has come to be known as a\nDutch Book Argument, later made more precise by de Finetti (1937; see\nthe entry on\n Dutch book arguments\n for details).\n\nHaving established what he takes to be the conditions of\nconsistency for partial beliefs, Ramsey concludes his paper\nwith a lengthy discussion on what (in addition) might make a set of\npartial beliefs reasonable (as opposed to just\nconsistent). He proposes a condition of calibration,\nor fit with known frequencies:\n\n\nLet us take a habit of forming opinion in a certain way; e.g. the\nhabit of proceeding from the opinion that a toadstool is yellow to the\nopinion that it is unwholesome. Then we can accept the fact that the\nperson has a habit of this sort, and ask merely what degree of opinion\nthat the toadstool is unwholesome it would be best for him to\nentertain when he sees it\u2026 And the answer is that it will in\ngeneral be best for his degree of belief that a yellow toadstool is\nunwholesome to be equal to the proportion of yellow toadstools which\nare in fact unwholesome. (This follows from the meaning of degree of\nbelief.) (1926a, [FM] 195)\n\n\nSo, for example, if 1 in 100 yellow toadstools is unwholesome, then\nceteris paribus one should believe that this\ntoadstool is unwholesome, given that it is yellow, to degree\n\\(0.01\\).Something like this condition has reappeared in a number of\nlater works (e.g., Shimony 1988; Lewis 1980); see the entry on\n Interpretations of Probability,\n \u00a73.3.4, for more discussion.\n\nIt would be hard to understate the importance of the above ideas to\nthe subjectivist tradition. It is a major testament to the originality\nof Ramsey\u2019s essay that it contains not only the first\nappearances of two of the main contemporary arguments for\nprobabilistic norms on partial belief, but also an influential case\nfor a normative link between partial beliefs and known frequencies.\nFurthermore, most attempts to characterise degrees of belief in the\nsubjectivist tradition have made central appeal to their connection\nwith preferences. (See de Finetti 1937, Savage 1954, Anscombe &\nAumann 1963, Maher 1993, Elliott 2021; for criticisms of the approach,\nsee Joyce 1999, \u00a71.3; Eriksson & H\u00e1jek 2007; Meacham\n& Weisberg 2011; Stef\u00e1nsson 2017.) Indeed, in much of\nphilosophy, economics and psychology still today, the default or\northodox way to operationalise degrees of belief is in terms of\nchoices, along essentially the same lines that Ramsey put forward.\n7. Laws and Theories\n\nRamsey\u2019s main contributions to the philosophy of science stem\nfrom three posthumously published papers written in 1928 and 1929, one\non theoretical terms in theories and two on the distinction between\n(in modern terminology) laws of nature and accidental\ngeneralizations.\n7.1 Laws\n\nIn both papers on laws, Ramsey (1928b, \u00a72; 1929b, [FM]\n237\u201338) considers accidental generalization to be conjunctions\n([NP], n. 40; cf. Ramsey 1927a, [FM] 152\u201353) and thus normal\npropositions (for the relation to Wittgenstein, see\n \u00a72).\n In \u201cUniversals of Law and Fact\u201d, Ramsey (1928b, \u00a712)\nconsiders laws of nature to be propositions with a special status:\n\n[E]ven if we knew everything, we should still want to systematize our\nknowledge as a deductive system, and the general axioms in that system\nwould be the fundamental laws of nature. The choice of axioms is bound\nto some extent to be arbitrary, but what is less likely to be\narbitrary if any simplicity is to be preserved is a body of\nfundamental generalizations, some to be taken as axioms and others\ndeduced.\n\n\nThus laws of nature are the axioms and theorems in the simplest\naxiomatization of all of our knowledge. And while we currently do not\nknow everything, we can still find the simplest axiomatization for\nwhat we do know and what we expect to come to know (\u00a716).\nFollowing Lewis (1973 [1986], \u00a73.3), a similar view of laws has\nbeen developed and discussed as the \u201cBest System\u201d account\nof laws, which, however, does not demand that we find the simplest\naxiomatization of all our knowledge, but rather of as much of\nour knowledge as is possible while retaining a high enough level of\nsimplicity (see also Carroll 2016, \u00a72).\n\n\u201cGeneral Propositions and Causality\u201d, written in the\nsummer of 1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii) and with additional notes from\nSeptember 1929 ([NP] note 74), explicitly retracts the view that laws\n(here called \u2018variable hypotheticals\u2019) are propositions\n(1929b, [FM] 238; for the relation to Weyl, see\n \u00a72).\n Rather (1929b, [FM] 241):\n\nVariable hypotheticals are not judgments but rules for judging\n\u2018If I meet a \\(\\phi\\), I shall regard it as a \\(\\psi\\)\u2019.\nThis cannot be negated but it can be disagreed with\nby one who does not adopt it.\n\n\nThus variable hypotheticals \u201cform the system with which the\nspeaker meets the future\u201d in that \u201cwe trust [a conjunction\nof their instances] to guide us in a new instance\u201d exactly\nbecause the conjunction is evidence for the variable hypothetical.\nSimplicity may still play a role, but not as constitutive of laws (as\nin the earlier, Best System account), rather only as epistemic\njustification for adopting a rule of judgment (1929b, [FM] 242). This\nallows again for the non-arbitrariness if not uniqueness of laws.\nUnknown laws are those rules of judgment whose adoption is justified\nby unknown facts (1929b, [FM] 243\u201345).\n\nIn both papers, \u2018if \u2026 then \u2026\u2019 statements,\ncalled \u2018conditionals\u2019, are taken to differ from material\nimplications in that they can be inferred from the system of laws\n(1928b, \u00a715; 1929b, [FM] 248). Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 249) takes\nconditionals to encompass both the indicative and subjunctive mood\n(see \u00a75 on Conditionals) and he identifies causal laws with\nconditionals in which the event described in the antecedent takes\nplace before the event described in the consequent.\n\nRamsey\u2019s earlier, Best System account of laws fits well with\nHumean constraints of metaphysics (Carroll 2016, \u00a72), and Ramsey\n(1929b, [FM] 252\u201353; 254\u201355, n. 4) is explicit that his\nlater, non-propositional account of laws avoids \u201creal\nconnections of universals\u201d and is in the spirit of Hume. At\nfirst Ramsey (1928b, \u00a715) even states that the material\nimplication is all we practically need, while later acknowledging that\nconditionals are necessary for assigning praise and blame (1929b, [FM]\n245\u201346).\n7.2 Theories\n\nHis non-propositional account of laws, Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 254, n. 2)\nnotes, renders theoretical laws twice removed from propositions:\n\n[Laws] are used in the same way in a theoretical system as in a\nprimary system; cause, too, if the theoretical system is temporal. Of\ncourse the theoretical system is all like a variable hypothetical in\nbeing there just to be deduced from; and a law in the theoretical\nsystem is at two removes of deduction.\n\n\nIn his paper \u201cTheories\u201d (1929a), written in the summer of\n1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii), Ramsey calls the observational language\n\u2018primary system\u2019. The non-observational (theoretical)\nlanguage is called \u2018secondary system\u2019 (see also\n \u00a72).\n The paper is thoroughly instrumentalistic, since the factual content\nof theories consists only of their primary implications. This is made\nclear in a comment on the paper, written in August 1929 ([NP] 229,\nfootnote removed; see also Ramsey (1931, [FM] 260):\n\n\nThe essence of a theory is that we make our assertions in a form\ncontaining a lot of parameters, which have to be eliminated in order\nto get our real meaning.\n\nWe mean to assert everything that can be deduced and does not contain\na parameter.\n\n\nThe \u201cparameters\u201d here are the secondary terms. And Ramsey\n([NP] 236) stresses in a note on the infinite in mathematics that\ntheir use does not entail any ontological commitment:\n\nIt is obvious that mathematics does not require the existence of an\ninfinite number of things. We say at once that imaginary things will\ndo, i.e. theoretical secondary terms. But there are no imaginary\nthings, they are just words, and mathematicians and physicists who use\nthe infinite are just manipulating symbols with some analogy to\npropositions.\n\n\nTo investigate the relation of the primary and the secondary system,\nRamsey (1929a, [FM] 215\u201319) provides a primary system for an\nagent who, in discrete time intervals, can move forwards and\nbackwards, open and close their eyes, and see blue, red, or nothing.\nIn the secondary system, Ramsey formulates a toy theory that describes\nthe movement of the agent among three locations and the sometimes\nchanging color of the locations. A dictionary defines the primary\nterms in the secondary system so that, for instance, the agent sees\nblue if and only if situated at a blue location with open eyes.\n\nRamsey (1929a, [FM] 217\u201319) shows that all the theory\u2019s\nimplications in the primary system can be listed without the use of\nthe secondary system and, contrary to \u201cRussell, Whitehead, Nicod\nand Carnap\u201d (220), that it is virtually impossible to define the\nsecondary terms in the primary system:\n\n[T]here is neither in this case nor in general any simple way of\ninverting the dictionary so as to get either a unique or an obviously\npreeminent solution which will also satisfy the axioms, the reason for\nthis lying partly in difficulties of detail in the solution of the\nequations, partly in the fact that the secondary system has a higher\nmultiplicity, i.e. more degrees of freedom, than the primary. (222)\n\n\nCarnap (1923, 100) had already noted the additional degrees of freedom\nin the secondary system, but without appreciating the implication\n(obvious for Ramsey) regarding the inversion of the dictionary.\nRamsey\u2019s qualification that there is no simple\ninversion is needed to exclude the following case: Assume that all the\nmodels of the theory and the dictionary are finite and all objects\nhave names in the primary system. Then in each model \\(M_i\\), each\nterm \\(T_j\\) of the secondary system is co-extensional with a formula\n\\(\\phi_{i,j}\\) in the primary system. If furthermore each model is\nnamed by a sentential constant \\(C_i\\) of the primary system, one can\ndefine each term \\(T_jx_1\\ldots x_n\\) as the conjunction of the\nmaterial implications \\(C_i \\to \\phi_{i,j}(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) for all\nmodels \\(M_i\\) (220\u201321). However, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 230)\nargues, apart from being cumbersome, definitions for secondary terms\nactually hinder scientific development because they require conceptual\ndecisions based on fiat rather than further empirical discoveries (cf.\nBraithwaite 1953, 52\u201376). This criticism was later rediscovered\nby Carnap (1936, 449).\n\nTo avoid these problems, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 231) suggests a way of\napplying a theory without defining the secondary terms:\n\nThe best way to write our theory seems to be this:\n\n\\((\\exists \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)\\): dictionary \\(\\cdot\\)\naxioms.\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are variables for the terms of\nthe secondary system and are interpreted purely extensionally, so that\nthe theory states \u201cThere are extensions \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\),\nand \\(\\gamma\\) that satisfy the sentences of the dictionary and the\naxioms\u201d. In contemporary presentations, the axioms are usually\ndenoted \\(T\\) (for \u2018theory\u2019), the dictionary is denoted\n\\(C\\) (for \u2018correspondence rules\u2019), and the secondary\nterms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are treated as parameters in \\(T\\) and\n\\(C\\), so that the conjunction of axioms and dictionary is written as\n\\(TC(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n)\\). What is now called the \u2018Ramsey\nsentence\u2019 \\({TC}^R\\) is then written as \n\\[ {TC}^R = \\exists X_1,\\ldots ,X_nTC(X_1,\\ldots ,X_n), \\]\n\n\nthat is, in the conjunction of all axioms and sentences of the\ndictionary, the theoretical terms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are replaced by\nvariables \\(X_1,\\ldots ,X_n\\) and bound by existential quantifiers.\nThis procedure is now known as \u2018Ramseyfication\u2019 or\n\u2018Ramsification\u2019. If some of the theoretical terms are of\nthe highest order (predicates or functions of \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\)\norder in \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) order logic), then Ramseyfication\nincreases the order of the theory by one. While higher-order\nexistential quantification was commonly used to express consistency\nwhen Ramsey wrote \u201cTheories\u201d, he was the first to quantify\non only some of the terms (Demopoulos 2003, 256). Crucially, the\nRamsey sentence contains no theoretical terms while still entailing\nthe same primary statements as \\(TC\\) (for a simple proof, see Bohnert\n1967, 342\u201343). Since all of \\(TC\\)\u2019s sentences are in the\nscope of the existential quantifiers introduced during Ramseyfication,\n\\({TC}^R\\) does not assign meaning to individual secondary sentences\nor terms. However, we can still reason with them by deriving primary\npropositions from them within the scope of the quantifiers, just as we\ncan derive propositions from variable hypotheses (1929a, [FM] 232;\nBohnert 1967, 344\u201347). Hence secondary universal sentences are\n\u201cat two removes\u201d from propositions, and secondary\nsentences and terms are only meaningful in the context of the theory\nto which they belong (1931, 260).\n\nAs an example, consider a simplification of Ramsey\u2019s toy theory\nthat states that being at a blue location with open eyes is followed\nby being at a red location with open eyes: \\(\\forall x(Bx \\wedge Ox\n\\to Rx' \\wedge Ox')\\), where \\(x'\\) is the successor of \\(x\\).\n\u2018Blue\u2019 (\\(B\\)), \u2018red\u2019 (\\(R\\)), and \u2018open\neyes\u2019 (\\(O\\)) are theoretical terms. The correspondence rules\ndefine the observational terms \u2018perceiving blue\u2019 as\n\u2018being at a blue location with open eyes\u2019, \\(\\forall x(Px\n\\leftrightarrow Bx \\wedge Ox)\\), and correspondingly \u2018perceiving\nred\u2019 \\(\\forall x(Qx \\leftrightarrow Rx \\wedge Ox)\\). The Ramsey\nsentence of \\(TC\\) is then: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\exists X_1,X_2,X_3[& \\forall x(Px \\leftrightarrow X_1x \\wedge X_2x) \\;\\wedge \\\\\n & \\forall x(Qx \\leftrightarrow X_3x \\wedge X_2x) \\;\\wedge \\\\\n & \\forall x(X_1x \\wedge X_2x \\to X_3x' \\wedge X_2x')] \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis is equivalent to the observational sentence \\(\\forall x(Px \\to\nQx')\\), which states that perceiving blue is followed by perceiving\nred. For any specific location \\(a\\), this variable hypothetical then\nbecomes the proposition \\(Pa \\to Qa'\\).\n\nWhile sentences of any order can be Ramseyfied, many technical\ndiscussions (e.g., the overview by van Benthem 1978) treat the special\ncase in which axioms and dictionary are of first order and the Ramsey\nsentence is of second order. In this case, the class of models of the\nobservational first-order implications of \\(TC\\) can be a proper\nsuperset of the class of models of \\({TC}^R\\). This has been known at\nleast since 1941 as the difference between elementary and\npseudoelementary classes (Hodges 1993, 207, 260) and is regularly\nrediscovered in philosophy (see Demopoulos 2011, 179). It entails that\n\\({TC}^R\\) can be false in a structure even though all the first order\nimplications of \\(TC\\) are true. Specifically, \\(TC\\) may only have\ntautological observational implications even though the Ramsey\nsentence is not logically true; this situation is one version of the\ndistinction between syntactic and semantic conservativeness known from\ndefinition theory (Gupta 2015, \u00a72.3; Prze\u0142\u0119cki 1969,\n52\u201353).\n\nCarnap (1963, \u00a724.D) used the Ramsey sentence for distinguishing\nbetween the analytic and synthetic components of higher-order theories\n(Uebel 2016, \u00a73.5), and Lewis (1970) significantly modified the\nRamsey sentence to arrive at explicit definitions of secondary terms\n(Andreas 2017, \u00a74.4). This Ramsey-Lewis sentence has become\ncentral in the philosophy of mind (Levin 2017, \u00a74.1) and\nphilosophical methodology (Papineau 2016, \u00a72.3).\n\nIn current terminology, the semantics of the Ramsey sentence is the\nfollowing: \\({TC}^R\\) is true in a structure \\(S\\) for the primary\nterms if and only if it is possible to add interpretations for the\nsecondary terms to \\(S\\) such that \\(TC\\) is true (Prze\u0142\u0119cki\n1969, ch. 6; Andreas 2017, \u00a74.2). Sneed (1971, 106) modified the\nsemantics of the Ramsey sentence for the use in structuralism (Schmidt\n2014, \u00a72.2.1; Stegm\u00fcller 1976, 88\u201389). Maxwell (1970,\n186\u201388) identified the Ramsey sentence with its semantics to\nargue that the Ramsey sentence expresses structural realism (see also\nLadyman 2016, \u00a73.2). Dewar (2019) argues that this is\nmisguided.\n8. Contributions to Mathematics\n\nDespite being employed as a mathematician at Cambridge Ramsey only\npublished one paper (1930) firmly in that subject, though two ideas he\nintroduced in his more philosophical papers (1926a, 1929b), also led\neventually to new lines of mathematical research. Each of these three\ncontributions has proved seminal and they are now rightly associated\nwith his name.\n\nOf these three Ramsey is best known within philosophy for his somewhat\nsketchy description of what later became known as the Dutch Book\nargument or theorem, see Vineberg 2016. In his unpublished paper\n\u201cTruth and Probability\u201d (1926a), Ramsey proposed a set of\naxioms and assumptions, his Laws of Preference, which enable\na subject to correlate the value of options \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\)\nand the preference relation between them with real numbers under the\nstandard ordering. Using \\(\\alpha\\) etc. as Ramsey does to denote both\nthe option and its correlated real number allows a subject in turn to\nequate their degree of belief in a proposition \\(p\\) with the\nratio \n\\[\\bel(p)= \\frac{\\alpha- \\gamma}{\\beta - \\gamma}\\]\n\n\nwhen, as far as the subject is concerned, the option \n\\[ \\alpha \\text{ (for certain)} \\]\n\n\nand the option \n\\[ \\beta \\text{ if } p \\text{ is true, } \\gamma \\text{ if } p \\text{ is false} \\]\n\n\nare equally preferable.\n\nRamsey then asserted that for partial belief (i.e. not certain belief)\n\u201cThis amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief in \\(p\\)\nby the odds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet being\nconducted in terms of differences of value as defined\u201d. In\nmaking this rough identification then Ramsey draws on the already\n\u201cold-established\u201d idea of measuring one\u2019s degree of\nbelief in a proposition \\(p\\) in terms of ones willingness to bet on\nits being true (1926a, [FM] 172). While he does not elaborate further\non this connection it is implicit in the derivations that follow that\nRamsey concludes that there is a number \\(x\\) such that for any option\n\\(\\xi\\) and any stake \\(t\\) (positive or negative), \\(\\xi\\) for\ncertain is equivalent to: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\xi + \\text{receive } (1-x)t, &\\text{ if } p \\text{ is true} \\\\\n \\xi + \\text{receive } -xt, &\\text{ if } p \\text{ is false} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nAs above this gives \\(\\bel(p)=x\\), from which we might surmise that\nRamsey intends \\(\\bel(p)\\) to be that number for which the\noptions: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{receive } (1-\\bel(p))t, &\\text{ if } p \\text{ is true} \\\\\n \\text{receive } {-}\\bel(p)t, &\\text{ if } p \\text{ is false} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nare all equally acceptable to the subject. (There is an assumption\nhere that the stake \\(t\\) is not so great as to incur\n\u201cdiminishing marginal utility\u201d.)\n\nWith this definition of the function \\(\\bel(p)\\) and its further\nextension \\(\\bel(p\\mid q)\\) to conditional belief in \\(p\\) given\n\\(q\\), for which Ramsey claims credit, he argues that if a\nsubject\u2019s degrees of belief are consistent in the sense of\nobeying these Laws of Preference (alternatively, as Ramsey simply\nstates, do not allow a [Dutch] book to be made against him by which he\nwould lose in any event) then \\(Bel\\) must satisfy the\n\u201cfundamental laws of probable belief (degrees of belief between\n0 and 1)\u201d, which he gives as: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\bel(p) + \\bel(\\neg p) = 1, \\\\\n &\\bel(p\\mid q) + \\bel(\\neg p\\mid q) = 1, \\\\\n &\\bel(p \\wedge q) = \\bel(q\\mid p) \\cdot \\bel(p), \\\\\n &\\bel(p \\wedge q) + \\bel(p \\wedge \\neg q) = \\bel(p). \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nRamsey also states, again without proof, the converse (1926a, [FM],\n183):\n\n\nHaving degrees of belief obeying the laws of probability implies a\nfurther measure of consistency, namely such a consistency between the\nodds acceptable on different propositions as shall prevent a book\nbeing made against you.\n\n\nNowadays, this result is commonly attributed to John Kemeny (1955) and\nindependently Sherman Lehman (1955).\n\nSuch casual allusions to important new mathematical results without\nfurther explanation seems to have been a feature of Ramsey\u2019s\nwriting.\n\nUnaware of Ramsey\u2019s result, Bruno de Finetti published (1931) a\ndetailed direct proof that if a subject\u2019s (unconditional)\ndegrees of belief \\(\\bel(p)\\) do not allow such a book, he calls such\na subject coherent, then \\(\\bel\\) must satisfy what would\nlater become know as Kolmogorov\u2019s Axioms (1933) for a finitely\nadditive probability function and conversely. In consequence of this\nfuller explication the forward direction of the Dutch Book argument\nfor belief as probability is commonly attributed to de Finetti\nalone.\n\nIn recent times Dutch Book arguments have become an established topic\nin philosophy and mathematics in terms of analysing and extending the\noriginal argument to other logics, see Vineberg 2016.\n\nA second important mathematical contribution of Ramsey is based on the\nfollowing brief footnote in his otherwise philosophical paper\nGeneral Propositions and Causality (1929b, [FM] 247):\n\n\nIf two people are arguing \u2018If \\(p\\) will \\(q\\)?\u2019 and are\nboth in doubt as to \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically to\ntheir stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\); so\nthat in a sense \u2018If \\(p\\), \\(q\\)\u2019 and \u2018If \\(p\\), not\n\\(q\\)\u2018 are contradictories.\n\n\nStarting with Robert Stalnaker (1968) this has been (mis)interpreted\n(see the section on Conditionals) as a bridge between logics of\n(indicative) conditionals (Edgington 2014, Arlo-Costa 2016) and logics\nof belief revision (Hansson 2017). In the former the interest is in\nformalising the properties of conditional assertions such as\nif \\(p\\) then \\(q\\), denoted \\(p>q\\), their\nsemantics and the rules and constraints that, arguably, they should\nobey. For the latter the focus is on capturing the rules and\nconstraints that, again arguably, should apply when an agent\u2019s\nset of beliefs \\(K\\), is to be revised, to \\(K*p\\) say, on receipt of\nnew information \\(p\\) which, in particular, may not even be consistent\nwith the original \\(K\\).\n\nThe above footnote has been formalised within this notation as the so\ncalled Ramsey\u2019s Test:\n\nAn agent with belief set \\(K\\) should accept \\(p \\gt q\\) iff \\(q \\in\nK*p\\)\n\nThrough this recipe then any logic of conditionals generates a logic\nof belief revision, and conversely. In this way it can act as a\ntest of the appropriateness of a logic of conditionals by\nopening up the corresponding logic of belief revision to scrutiny, and\nagain conversely.\n\nNot surprisingly then Ramsey\u2019s Test, in this or in its many\namended forms, has been hugely influential in the formal development\nof the logics of conditionals and belief revision in recent years, in\nphilosophy and equally in artificial intelligence.\n\nDespite its important contribution however Ramsey\u2019s Test has in\ncertain guises fallen foul of so called Triviality Theorems,\nstarting with G\u00e4rdenfors (1986), which show that under certain\nconditions and apparently reasonable constraints on the belief\nrevision Ramsey\u2019s Test can only apply to a very limited family\nof belief sets \\(K\\). That is, agents who satisfied Ramsey\u2019s\nTest could only consistently subscribe to very limited and trivial\nbelief sets. In particular this can happen if we allow \\(>\\) to\nfreely appear in the logical language from which the sentences \\(p,q\\)\netc. are formed since then it would seem that the Ramsey Test would\nequally amount to:\n\nRamsey Test (RT):\n\nFor an agent with belief set \\(K\\), \\((p>q) \\in K\\) iff \\(q\\in K *\np\\)\n\nFrom this it follows that \\(*\\) must be monotonic in the sense that if\n\\(K \\subseteq K'\\) then \\(K*p \\subseteq K'*p\\), since if \\(q \\in K*p\\)\nthen \\((p>q) \\in K\\) by (RT) so \\(K \\subseteq K'\\) gives \\((p>q)\n\\in K'\\) and hence by (RT) again \\(q \\in K'*p\\). But this is a\nconclusion which goes against intuition, and unless the allowed belief\nsets \\(K\\) are severely limited, contradicts ostensibly reasonable\nassumptions about \\(*\\), including in particular that if \\(p\\) is\nconsistent with \\(K\\) then \\(K*p\\) should be simply the logical\nconsequences of \\(K \\cup\\{p\\}\\).\n\nRamsey\u2019s third contribution, and the one most directly important\nfor mathematics, consists of two closely related theorems proved in\nthe paper On a Problem of Formal Logic (1930) which was read\nto the London Mathematical Society on the 13th December 1928. This\nmaterial is uncompromisingly aimed at mathematicians and with\napologies its explication herein requires some necessary\ntechnicalities.\n\nThe first of these theorems says that if \\(n,r\\) are finite positive\nnumbers and \\(X\\) is an infinite set and we partition the set of\nsubsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts then there is an\ninfinite subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) such that every subset of \\(Y\\) of size\n\\(n\\) is in the same part. The second theorem gives a version of the\nfirst, but for finite sets of sufficiently large size. It says that,\nfor any finite positive numbers \\(m,n,r\\) there is a finite positive\n\\(k\\) such that if \\(X\\) has at least \\(k\\) elements, and we partition\nthe sets of subsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts, then\nthere is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) with at least \\(m\\) elements such\nthat every subset of \\(Y\\) of size \\(n\\) is in the same part of the\npartition. Ramsey gave an upper bound on such a \\(k\\) in terms of\n\\(m,n,r\\) but even today the actual value of the least such \\(k\\),\nknown as the Ramsey Number \\(R_n(m,r)\\), is unknown in all\nbut a handful of cases for small \\(n,m,r\\). These two results are now\nreferred to as the Infinite and Finite Ramsey Theorems, respectively.\nThey can be viewed as generalizing Dirichlet\u2019s much earlier\nSchubfachprinzip or Pigeon Hole Principle\n(1832).\n\nRamsey then uses the finite theorem in this paper to show that for\neach sentence, from a relational language with equality, of the\nform \n\\[\\exists z_1, \\ldots, z_m \\forall x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\, \\theta(z_1, \\ldots, z_m,x_1, \\ldots, x_n),\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is quantifier free, one could effectively decide if\nit was satisfiable in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\). Ramsey\nachieved this by showing that one can write down a natural number\n\\(k\\) such that for any cardinal \\(\\kappa \\geq k\\) this sentence can\nbe satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) just if it\ncan be satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(k\\), and to\ndetermine this latter just requires checking its satisfiability in one\nof the finitely many such structures. An important innovation in his\nproof was the notion of indiscernibles which was to reappear,\napparently independently, three decades later in Model Theory. It was\nsubsequently employed in the proof of Michael Morley\u2019s seminal\nCategoricity Theorem (1965) and later in the proof of the\nParis-Harrington Theorem (Paris & Harrington 1977).\n\nThis result of Ramsey\u2019s improved on earlier joint work of Paul\nBernays and Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel (1928) and solves the prospective\nSpectrum Problem (Scholz 1952), for sentences of the above\nform, now referred to as the Bernays-Sch\u00f6nfinkel-Ramsey Class.\nThat is, for such sentences it enables us to determine the class of\ncardinalities of structures in which that sentence can be satisfied.\nAs a corollary it gives that one can effectively decide if a sentence\nin this class is satisfiable in some structure. However it\nseems clear from the accompanying discussion that Ramsey was aware\nthat there was also a direct and simple proof of this fact.\n\nThis corollary would seem to justify Ramsey\u2019s stated aim in this\npaper to provide a step towards a positive solution to Hilbert\u2019s\nEntscheidungsproblem though it is possible that the aim he\nactually had in mind was the related Spectrum Problem. Hilbert\u2019s\ngoal was later shown to be not achievable by the undecidability\nresults of Alonzo Church (1936) and independently Alan Turing (1937).\nIn fact Ramsey\u2019s positive contribution turned out to be the best\npossible in the sense that decidability fails once the order of the\nblocks of existential and universal quantifiers is reversed, see\nKalm\u00e1r & Sur\u00e1nyi 1950, and Mortimer 1975.\n\nRamsey\u2019s Theorems were later popularised in an influential paper\nof Paul Erd\u0151s and George Szekeres (1935) and initiated in the\nearly 1970s the establishment of Ramsey Theory as a major\nsubdiscipline of Combinatorics. The basic aim in this subdiscipline is\nto show that mathematical structures of a certain type and size (and\ngenerally non-uniform) must have within them uniform substructures of\na certain type and size, see Katz & Reimann 2018,\nNe\u0161et\u0159il & R\u00f6dl 1990, and Spencer & Graham\n1990.\n\nRamsey\u2019s Theorems themselves have yielded numerous important\napplications, generalizations and concepts in other branches of\nmathematics. For example the notion of a Ramsey Cardinal,\n\\(\\kappa\\), where we require that for a set \\(X\\) of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\) and any partition of the finite subsets of \\(\\kappa\\) into\ntwo sets there is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\), also of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\), such that any two finite subsets of \\(Y\\) of the same size\nare in the same part of the partition. Ramsey Cardinals were one of\nthe first examples of large cardinals, a central area of\nresearch in Set Theory. One feature of such cardinals is that they are\nso large that their existence cannot be proved within ZFC.\n\nIn addition to these contributions to mathematics Frank Ramsey (1925a)\ndevoted much effort to addressing what were by then seen as problems\nin Whitehead & Russell\u2019s attempt in their Principia\nMathematica (1910\u20131913), to base mathematics on formal\nlogic, an enterprise which Ramsey initially strongly supported though\nhe ultimately became disappointed with his efforts to correct its\nshortcomings, see Paul 2012 (232). Since then this approach to the\nfoundations of mathematics has been very largely overshadowed amongst\nmathematicians by the practically simpler device of assuming as a\nfoundation Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["A.
