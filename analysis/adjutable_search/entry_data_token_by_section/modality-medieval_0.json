Aspects of Ancient Modal Paradigms\n\nIn speaking about the general features of the universe, ancient\nphilosophers were inclined to think that all generic possibilities\nwill be actualized, a habit of thinking called the principle of\nplenitude by Arthur O. Lovejoy (1936). Correspondingly, it was natural\nfor them to think that the invariant structures of reality are\nnecessary. This line of thought is found, e.g., in Plato\u2019s\ndoctrine of the ideas which are exhaustively imitated in the world by\nthe Demiurge, in Aristotle\u2019s theory of the priority of actuality\nover potentiality, in the Stoic doctrine of the rational world-order\nand the eternal cosmic cycles, as well as in Plotinus\u2019s\nmetaphysics of emanation (Knuuttila 1993).\n\nIn these approaches to the constituents of the universe, modal notions\ncould be understood in accordance with the so-called\n\u2018statistical\u2019 or \u2018temporal frequency\u2019 model of\nmodality where the meaning of modal terms is spelled out extensionally\nas follows: what is necessary is always actual, what is impossible is\nnever actual and what is possible is at least sometimes actual. The\nterm \u2018statistical interpretation of modality\u2019 was\nintroduced into the modern discussion by Oscar Becker (1952), and it\nhas been applied since in descriptions of certain ways of thinking in\nthe history of philosophy as well, particularly by Jaakko Hintikka\n(1973).\n\nEven though Aristotle did not define modal terms with the help of\nextensional notions, examples of this way of thinking can be found in\nhis discussion of eternal beings, the natures of things, the types of\nevents, and generic statements about such things. (See, for example,\nMetaphysics. IX.10.) Modal terms refer to the one and only\nworld of ours and classify the types of things and events on the basis\nof their actuality. This paradigm suggests that actualization is the\ngeneral criterion of the genuineness of possibilities, but the\ndeterministic implications of this view compelled Aristotle to seek\nways of speaking about unrealized singular possibilities. Diodorus\nChronus (fl. 300 BCE) was a determinist who found no problem in this\nway of thinking. Some commentators have argued that Aristotle\u2019s\nviews showing similarities to the statistical model are based on\nspecial metaphysical and ontological doctrines and not on his\nunderstanding of modal terms themselves. However, it is not clear that\nAristotle had any such distinction in mind. (For different\ninterpretations and evaluations of the role of this model in\nAristotle, see Hintikka 1973, Sorabji 1980, Seel 1982, Waterlow 1982a,\nvan Rijen 1989, Gaskin 1995.) In Posterior Analytics I.6,\nAristotle states that certain predicates may belong to their subjects\nat all times without belonging to them necessarily. Some ancient\ncommentators took this to mean that Aristotle operated with a\ndistinction between strong essential per se necessities and\nweak accidental necessities in the sense of non-essential invariances,\nsuch as inseparable accidents (see also Porphyry, Isagoge\n3.5\u20136), and that this distinction played an important role in\nhis modal syllogistic. See the commentaries on the Prior\nAnalytics by Alexander of Aphrodisias (36.25\u201332;\n201.21\u201324) and Philoponus (43.8\u201318; 126.7\u201329);\nFlannery 1995, 62\u201365, 99\u2013106. This was also the view of\nAverroes and some Latin authors in the Middle Ages. (See below,\nsection 3.)\n\nAnother Aristotelian modal paradigm was that of possibility as a\npotency. In Met. V.12 and IX.1 potency is said to be the\nprinciple of motion or change either as the activator or as the\nreceptor of a relevant influence. (For agent and patient in\nAristotle\u2019s natural philosophy in general, see Waterlow 1982b.)\nThe types of potency-based possibilities belonging to a species are\nrecognized as possibilities because of their actualization \u2014 no\nnatural potency type remains eternally frustrated. Aristotle says that\nwhen the agent and the patient come together and there is no\nhindrance, the one must act and the other must be acted on\n(Met. IX.5).\n\nIn De Caelo I.12 Aristotle supposes, per\nimpossibile, that a thing has contrary potencies, one of which is\nalways actualized. He argues that the alleged eternally unactualized\npotencies are not potencies at all because they cannot be assumed to\nbe realized at any time without contradiction. Aristotle applies here\nthe model of possibility as non-contradictoriness which is defined in\nPrior Analytics I.13 as follows: when a possibility is\nassumed to be realized, it results in nothing impossible. In speaking\nabout the assumed non-contradictory actualization of a possibility,\nAristotle thinks that it is realized in real history. Aristotle uses\nin De Caelo I.12 and in some other places (for example,\nMet IX.4, An. pr. I.15) a reductio argument\nwhich consists of assuming the denial of what is to be proved and\nshowing that this leads to a contradiction. The argument has created\nmuch controversy about how possibilities are supposed to obtain. See\nJudson 1983; Rini 2011, 135\u2013156; Rosen and Malink 2012; Smith\n2016.) \n\nAristotle refers to potencies in criticizing some of his\ncontemporaries who claimed that only that which takes place is\npossible (Met. IX.3). The model of possibility as potency\nprima facie allowed him to speak about all kinds of\nunrealized singular possibilities by referring to passive or active\npotencies, but taken separately they represent partial possibilities\nwhich do not guarantee that their actualization can take place. More\nis required for a real singular possibility, but when the further\nrequirements are added, such as a contact between the active and\npassive factor and the absence of an external hindrance, the potency\nmodel suggests that the potency can really be actualized only when it\nis actualized (Met. IX.5, Phys. VIII.1). It is\npossible that this led Aristotle to define motion\n(kin\u00easis) as the actuality of the potentiality (of the\nend) qua potentiality (Phys. III.1), but this did\nnot explain the possibility of beginning (Hintikka et al. 1977).\n\nIn discussing future contingent statements in In Chapter 9 of De\ninterpretatione, Aristotle says that what is, necessarily is when\nit is, but he then qualifies this necessity of the present with the\nremark that it does not follow that what is actual is necessary\nwithout qualification. If he meant that the temporal necessity of a\npresent event does not imply that such an event necessarily takes\nplace in circumstances of that type, this is an unsatisfactory\n\u2018statistical\u2019 attempt to avoid the problem that\nchangeability as a criterion of contingency makes all temporally\ndefinite singular events necessary (Hintikka 1973). Another\ninterpretation is that Aristotle wanted to show that the necessity of\nan event at a certain time does not imply that it would have been\nantecedently necessary. Aristotle discusses such singular diachronic\nmodalities in some places (Met. VI.3; EN III.5,\n1114a17\u201321; De int. 19a13\u201317) in which he seems\nto assume that the conditions which at\nt1 are necessary for p to\nobtain at a later time t2 are not\nnecessarily sufficient for this, although they might be sufficient for\nthe possibility (at t1) that\np obtains at t2. Aristotle\ndid not elaborate these ideas, which might have been his most\npromising attempt to formulate a theory of unrealized singular\npossibilities (for example  De int. 19a12\u201314. The\nimportance of this model is particularly stressed in Waterlow 1982a;\nsee also von Wright 1984; Weidemann 1986; Gaskin 1995.\n\nAristotle\u2019s conceptual difficulties can be seen from his various\nattempts to characterize the possibilities based on dispositional\nproperties such as heatable, separable, or countable. Analogous\ndiscussions were not unusual in later ancient philosophy. In\nPhilo\u2019s definition of possibility (ca. 300 BCE), the existence\nof a passive potency was regarded as a sufficient ground for speaking\nabout a singular possibility. The Stoics revised this definition by\nadding the condition of the absence of external hindrance, thinking\nthat otherwise the alleged possibility could not be realized.\nAccording to the deterministic world view of the Stoics, fate as a\nkind of active potency necessitates everything, but they did not\naccept the Master Argument of Diodorus Cronus for determinism, which\nwas meant to show that there cannot be possibilities which will not be\nrealized. The number of passive potencies with respect to a definite\nfuture instant of time is greater than what will be realized. As long\nas these possibilities are not prevented from being realized by being\nunactualized, they in some sense represent open possibilities.\nAlexander of Aphrodisias was influenced by the Stoic ideas of\ndiachronic modalities, but he thought that it was misleading to speak\nabout unrealized diachronic possibilities if everything is determined.\nHe argued for what he took to be Aristotle\u2019s view, namely that\nthere are undetermined prospective alternatives which remain open\noptions until the moment of time to which they refer. (See Sharples\n1983; Bobzien 1993, 1998; Hankinson 1998.) Neither Aristotle nor later\nancient thinkers had any considered conception of simultaneous\nalternatives. They thought that what is, necessarily is when it is,\nand that the alternative possibilities disappear when the future is\nfixed. Alexander\u2019s Peripatetic theory of alternative prospective\npossibilities could be characterized as the model of diachronic\nmodalities without simultaneous alternatives: there are transient\nsingular alternative possibilities, but those which will not be\nrealized vanish instead of remaining unrealized.\n\nAristotle often made use of indirect arguments from false or\nimpossible positions by adding hypotheses which he himself labeled as\nimpossible. In order to defend Aristotle\u2019s procedure against\nancient critics, Alexander of Aphrodisias characterized these\nhypotheses as impossibilities that were not nonsensical. (For this\ncontroversy, see Kukkonen 2002.) Some late ancient authors were\ninterested in impossible hypotheses as tools for conceptual analysis.\nIn the arguments which were called Eudemian procedures something\nimpossible was assumed in order to see what followed. The\nimpossibilities discussed in this way by Philoponus and Boethius show\nsimilarities with Porphyry\u2019s characterization of inseparable\naccidents as something which cannot occur separately but can be\nseparated in thought. These hypotheses were not regarded as\nformulations of possibilities in the sense of what could be actual;\nthey were counterpossible and not merely counterfactual (Martin\n1999).\n\nThere are several recent works on Aristotle\u2019s modal\nsyllogistics, but no generally accepted historical reconstruction\nwhich would make it a coherent theory. It was apparently based on\nvarious assumptions which were not fully compatible (Hintikka 1973;\nSmith 1989; Striker 2009). Some commentators have been interested in\nfinding coherent layers of the theory by explicating them in terms of\nAristotle\u2019s other views (van Rijen 1989; Patterson 1995). There\nare also several formal reconstructions such as Rini 2011 (modern\npredicate logic), Ebert and Nortmann 2007 (possible worlds semantics),\nand various set-theoretical approaches discussed in Johnson 2004 and\nMalink 2006, 2013 (mereological semantics).\n",
