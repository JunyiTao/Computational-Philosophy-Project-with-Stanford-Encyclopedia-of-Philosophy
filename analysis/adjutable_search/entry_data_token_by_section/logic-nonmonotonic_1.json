    "main_text": "Dealing with conflicts\n2. Dealing with conflicts\n\nA separate issue from the formal properties of a non-monotonic\nconsequence relation, although one that is strictly intertwined with\nit, is the issue of how conflicts between potential defeasible\nconclusions are to be handled. \n\nWe can distinguish two types of conflict handling in defeasible\nreasoning both of which will be discussed in more detail below. On the\none hand, we have conflict resolution principles such as the\nSpecificity Principle or other measures of argument strength. On the\nother hand, we have reasoning types that deal in different ways with\nnon-resolvable conflicts, most prominently the Credulous and the\nSkeptical reasoning types. In this section we still stay on an\nabstract level while concrete NMLs are discussed in the section\n Non-Monotonic Formalisms.\n \n",
