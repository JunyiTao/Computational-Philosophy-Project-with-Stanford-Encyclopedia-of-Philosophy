The major context for this is UP, a text explicitly inspired by Aristotle. In this 17-volume magnum opus, Galen goes through the parts of the body one by one, in each case giving an account which justifies the proposition of the purposive nature of its construction. Taking Aristotle\u2019s approach (especially that of Parts of Animals), and the motto \u201cNature does nothing in vain\u201d, as starting-points, he is concerned to prove the perfect, providential nature of the construction of parts for the benefit of the animal, especially in the context of humans. Important, from the outset, is to insist upon the correct direction of causation: we have hands, etc., because we are intelligent (the view he attributes to Aristotle), not the other way round (the view he attributes to Anaxagoras) (UP I.3, 69\u201370).\nAs so often in Galen, the polemical aim is of major importance for the formulation of the argument. The recurrent target is that group of thinkers who deny intelligence or purpose as an explanans, and omit it from their causal accounts. Here Galen lumps together: a variety of ancient Atomist theorists; the followers of the Hellenistic medical author Erasistratus; and those of the more recent Asclepiades of Bithynia. All are accused of giving accounts which omit intelligence in the relevant sense, relying entirely on either spontaneous motions of bodies or mechanistic explanations of biological processes to explain the formation and maintenance of the complex processes of the human body.\nThere are further, distinctive features of the teleological account in UP. One is that\u2014in a highly intriguing and individualistic discussion which however is not developed in any detail (UP XI.14)\u2014Galen introduces the notion of the aesthetic alongside that of function. Some features of the human body are to be explained not just in terms of its being better for them to be so, but in terms of their making the body more beautiful. (Examples are the male foreskin and the buttocks, both of which hide what would otherwise be unsightly, and the beard in men.)\nThe same chapter is also interesting for the explicit contrast it makes between intelligent design as Galen, in the post-Platonic Greek tradition, understands it, and intelligent design as understood in the Jewish tradition. Here Galen famously contrasts his (Platonic) view with what he describes as that of the \u201cMosaic philosophy\u201d, the creation ex nihilo in which God\u2019s will is the only relevant cause, to which there is no limitation.\nFor Galen, the purpose of the divine Craftsman is, certainly, the most important cause, but the material cause must also be mentioned in a full account: matter represents the building-blocks used to realize the design, and in a sense provides a limitation to it. This interaction between design and material\u2014and the assertion of the final cause in opposition to those who deny it\u2014are the central features of Galen\u2019s account. In the (strikingly anthropomorphic) account of the Craftsman\u2019s construction of the human body at UP VI.13, however, Galen does indeed incorporate the five causes listed above. The Craftsman constructs the organs of the body as they are \u201cbecause it is better so\u201d, thus also bringing about the best possible \u201cform\u201d: this covers both final and formal causes. We must then see how he employs both \u201cinstruments\u201d and \u201cmatter\u201d to do so: this will take account of both instrumental and material causes, and although the distinction between these too may seem somewhat fluid, it it is further clarified that we should understand the wet and the dry as providing the material cause, while the hot and the cold are the \u201cactive instruments\u201d which the Craftsman uses to shape these. This corresponds to the Aristotelian distinction between the active and the passive pair amongst the fundamental elements (see below, \u00a76.1). In summarizing the five causes at the end of this passage, Galen uses the phrase \u201cfrom the Craftsman\u201d instead of \u201cefficient\u201d.\nGalen explicitly characterizes UP as a hymn to the divine creator (XVII.2\u20133, 732\u201333). This, of course, is not religion in any conventional sense: rather, it is the fact that one has gained detailed, in-depth knowledge, both of anatomy and of the chreia of the parts revealed in anatomy\u2014that is, of the close, detailed relationship between their their structure and their functional purpose\u2014that enables one to celebrate the creator appropriately.\nThe question arises, both within the teleological analysis of UP, and much more broadly throughout the Galenic corpus, of the relationship between the different causes. Some scholars have seen a tension between teleology and material causation in Galen (and some, such as Moraux 1984, even believed that they could identify a chronological development, from the \u201cearly\u201d position of UP, with its clear Aristotelian \u201cinstrumentalism\u201d, to the apparent physicalism or materialism of the \u201clate\u201d QAM\u2014on which see \u00a77 below). For further exploration of these issues see Singer 1997b; Havrda 2017; van der Eijk 2017; Singer and van der Eijk ad loc. on the passages from Temp. cited below.\nTo put it at its weakest, we may say that there are discussions of biological phenomena in which the teleological account appears to recede and an account in material terms seems to be all that is thought relevant. But it seems possible to go further. Whereas\u2014at the risk of simplifying a highly complex topic\u2014interpretations of Aristotle would tend to stress the co-existence and co-operation of the different causes, or at least of the material and the final and/or formal, in causal accounts in the natural world, certain Galenic passages seem to suggest (while making specific reference to Aristotle) that different types of causal account may be applicable at different levels within the natural or biological world. Considering, in the context of this discussion of bodily mixture, what constitutes perfection in a human being, Galen states:\n\nthe man \u2026 must not just be at the median of moisture and dryness, but must also have the best possible construction [or \u201cshaping\u201d: diaplasis]\u2014something which is perhaps a consequence of that good balance of the four elements, but may have some higher cause of a more divine nature (Temp. I.9, 229);\n\nlater, he attacks\n\nthe failure to regard the natural cause of our construction as a craftsmanlike power, whereby the parts are formed in a way suited to the characters of our souls,\n\nand goes on to claim that Aristotle raised a doubt as to whether this craftsmanlike power\n\nshould be attributed to some more divine cause, rather than just to hot, cold, dry, and wet (Temp. II.6, 261).\n\nIt seems that material causation is adequate in some areas, while design-based causation needs to be invoked at a higher level, in particular when one needs to explain animal and in particular human structures and their operations.\nWhereas one would think (on Aristotelian grounds) that an account in terms of the elements should require the simultaneous presence of a formal or final account, that is, that these pick out different aspects of the reality, matter always requiring a certain sort of organization, which corresponds to the formal or final\u2014and, further, such a perception is arguably borne out by QAM, with its suggested equation of bodily mixture with eidos, implying that the formal account will includes material elements in an appropriate way (see \u00a77.2 below)\u2014the above-cited texts seem to suggest that there is a higher-level cause which is added to the material cause in certain contexts, in particular, those that involve organic and higher-level structures.\nRelatedly, Galen at times makes a distinction between bodily features which were intended as part of the primary design or rationale (kata pr\u014dton logon) and those which follow by necessity, through physical causation, as a by-product of that design (Temp. II.5, 253; cf. UP XI.14, 534\u201336 on how providential design takes account of necessary physical consequences). Again, the consequence of such an analysis would seem to be that not all features of an animal can be equally part of a teleological account, or not part of it in the same sense. Certain things seem to happen spontaneously, or to follow unavoidably from the purposive cause, though not themselves intended.\nThis leads us to a broader question. To what extent can lower-level, elemental, descriptions constitute full accounts of higher-level phenomena in the body? (Compare the related discussion at \u00a76.4.) Two examples might be used to highlight the question: would a sufficiently full account of the nature of the mixture of the brain be an exhaustive account of what is happening in the psuch\u0113? And could a sufficiently full account of the balance of qualities\u2014the most basic physical level\u2014in a human body constitute an exhaustive account also (i) of its higher-level constituents, (ii) of the inception and (iii) of the nature of the diseases that befall the animal in that state, e.g., of a particular fever, or other disease state?\nWe shall return to the former question under \u00a77.2. The answer to the latter is complex, partly because of tendency for different conceptual areas to be discussed separately (e.g., the accounts of the composition and \u201cmixture\u201d (krasis) of the human body, though it includes an account of \u201cbad-mixtures\u201d (duskrasiai), is separate from that of fevers, or of melancholy).\nBut the three subsections of this question may yield somewhat different answers. (i) Galen clearly distinguishes three levels of bodily analysis: qualities/elements; humours and homoeomerous or uniform parts; and organs. (Humours, such as blood or bile, are in a sense uniform, although in a more detailed distinction of levels, they may constitute a further layer, between elements and uniform parts, see Hipp. Elem. 8, 126\u20137.) Here, too, Galen is heavily indebted to Aristotle (in particular to book II of the Parts of Animals). A formulation which Galen uses in relation to this three-level analysis is that the organic parts arise from the \u201ccomposition, amount, magnitude and shaping\u201d of the uniform parts, which in turn depend on a correct balance of the elements hot, cold, wet and dry (San. Tu. I.1, 3). It seems clear, although it is not always explicitly stated, that analysis at the organic level should, in principle, involve the teleological cause; as we have seen, this may not always be the case of analysis at lower levels, though Galen is exercised by the problem of how biological substances or low-level organisms contain within them the principles which bring about the relevant teleological or functional aims (see further \u00a76.2).\nIn the pathological area it seems more difficult to see the relevance of the teleological cause. (ii) Galen does seems to think that a sufficiently full account of the internal and external low-level conditions should be fully predictive of the disease outcome (this, then, will be a question of understanding in sufficient detail the preceding and antecedent causes). (iii) Certainly fevers are hot diseases and, moreover, their individual differences\u2014as well as the treatment indicated\u2014are to a considerable extent explicable in terms of the terminology of the fundamental qualities. Yet once they take hold, they function according to a complex rationale (Galen sometimes uses the term idea, \u201cform\u201d or \u201cstructure\u201d, related to the Aristotelian term for form, eidos, in reference to such disease entities) and appear to have their own causal powers; the best interpretation of the Galenic picture may, however, well be that such powers would in theory (via some complex hypothetical account which Galen understandably does not feel the need to consider) be fully explicable in terms of the states and interactions of fundamental qualities.\nIt is worth pursuing this line of enquiry a little further, in relation to Galen\u2019s account of primary and secondary properties and of emergent properties. On the one hand, all properties discernible by the senses can be understood on the basis of the primary qualities that exist at the elemental level. On the other, it is an essential part of Galen\u2019s theory of the composition of living bodies from elements that there are qualitatively different properties at higher levels\u2014that there are, in our terms, emergent properties. The fact that we experience pain and sensation, whereas elemental bodies do not, shows that there has been a fundamental transformation in their nature, in the process of the composition of higher-level bodies from lower-level ones. In principle, then, we might think, the fact that hot, cold, wet and dry are the relevant explanatory terms at the lowest level would not necessarily mean that they are helpful terms at the highest level\u2014that of everyday experience. After all, we talk in perceptual terms of substances being sharp, acrid, bitter, etc.\u2014and indeed Galen talks in such terms\u2014without in each case finding it important to give the causal explanation of those secondary properties in elemental terms. More than that: we might expect it to be the case that the use of these elemental terms was simply not helpful or relevant, precisely because of the Galenic theorization, just noted, of higher-level or secondary qualities as different in their nature from the primary ones.\nYet what is striking is that in spite of that theoretical apparatus, which would in principle mean that one might abandon talk in terms of hot, cold, wet and dry at higher levels of explanation\u2014in particular, in the advanced medical realm of disease description and treatment\u2014precisely these terms remain the central ones. Other descriptive and experiential terms are used, of course; but it is remarkable that, precisely in that area where Galen makes his most elaborate attempt to classify substances according to their properties and effects, namely in his extremely lengthy accounts of drugs\u2014accounts which include, one should add, a significant element of quantificatory analysis\u2014the \u201cscientific\u201d terms of description remain precisely these: hot, cold, wet and dry.\n",
