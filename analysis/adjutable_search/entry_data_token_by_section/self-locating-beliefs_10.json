    "main_text": "Another Motivation: Immunity to Error Through Misidentification\n4. Another Motivation: Immunity to Error Through Misidentification\n\nLewis and Perry overlap extensively on their motivations for their\nviews: Both are focused on cases of ignorance, doxastic difference,\nand doxastic similarity that aren\u2019t happily captured in terms of\nstates of believing P for traditional propositions\nP. But not all theorists of self-locating belief are\nmotivated in the same way.\n\nAnother source of motivation, common in other threads of the\nself-location literature, but not prominent in the Lewis/Perry\ndialectic, is the phenomenon of immunity to error through\nmisidentification.\n\nThere are a number of influential discussions of this\nphenomenon\u2014for some prominent and helpful examples, see\nWittgenstein (1953), Shoemaker (1968), Anscombe (1975), Evans (1982),\nPryor (1999), Recanati (2007), Coliva (2009), Garc\u00eda-Carpintero\n(2018), and the papers in Prosser and Recanati (2012). For more\nthorough discussion than we will offer here, see the supplement\n the scope of immunity to error through misidentification\n to the entry on\n Self-Consciousness.\n For a not-so-thorough introduction of the phenomenon, and how it can\nserve to motivate an account of self-locating belief, see below.\n\nHere is a framing of the phenomenon that follows Wittgenstein\u2019s\n(1953): There are two importantly different kinds of uses of\n\u201cI\u201d\u2014uses of \u201cI\u201d as subject and uses of\n\u201cI\u201d as object. There\u2019s a certain distinctive sort of\nerror that\u2019s possible in the second case but not in the first.\nConsider uses of \u201cI\u201d as object, as when I find myself, for\none reason or another, in a tangle of bodies, mistakenly take another\nperson\u2019s arm that I see to be mine, and judge, based on the\narm\u2019s visual appearance, \u201cI have a broken arm\u201d.\n(Perhaps I am participating in a game of Twister gone horribly wrong.)\nIn this case, my judgment is wrong, and in particular it\u2019s wrong\nbecause, though I\u2019ve correctly perceived that the arm I\u2019m\nlooking at is broken, I\u2019ve misidentified whose arm it is. In\nuses of \u201cI\u201d as subject, such as when I feel a pain and\njudge, \u201cI am in pain\u201d, my judgment can\u2019t be wrong in\nthe same way. Maybe I can be wrong about whether that sensation is a\npain, but I can\u2019t be wrong about whose sensation it is.\nJudgments employing \u201cI\u201d as subject are characterized as\nimmune to a particular type of error: they are immune to errors\nthrough misidentification.\n\nSubsequent literature has made much more precise the notion of error\nthrough misidentification, and has offered various hypotheses about\nexactly which beliefs (if any) are immune to such error. One recurring\nthread, though, is that if there\u2019s immunity to error through\nmisidentification, it\u2019s intimately bound up with thoughts about\noneself. If there are beliefs immune to error through\nmisidentification, then a particular class of thoughts about ourselves\nare among them.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Recanati (2007 and elsewhere) offers one prominent\naccount, building on Evans (1982) and Lewis (1979). Recanati\ndistinguishes between judgments whose contents do and do not contain\nan \u201cidentification component\u201d. Here\u2019s one way to\ncapture the thought: When Fran\u00e7ois has a de re thought\nabout Fran\u00e7ois \u2014where the content of the judgment is,\ne.g., that Fran\u00e7ois has a broken\narm\u2014that\u2019s a thought with an identification\ncomponent; the person represented as having a broken arm is explicitly\nrepresented, in the content of the judgment, as Fran\u00e7ois. When\nFran\u00e7ois has a distinctively self-locating thought, the content\nof the judgment is something \u201cidentification\nfree\u201d\u2014something corresponding to, for example, the\nproperty being in pain. In the latter case, there\u2019s no\ndanger of error due to misidentification, because there\u2019s no\nidentification-element in the judgment that can be the locus of\nmisidentification. (See Recanati 1993 and 2007 for Recanati\u2019s\nfull story.)\n\nSo the idea that some judgments are immune to misidentification-based\nerror provides another potential motivation for the introduction of a\ndistinctive category of self-directed belief: thinking about oneself\nas oneself.\n\nPursuing a different line, Anscombe (1975) suggests that the meanings\nof an individual\u2019s \u201cI\u201d-thoughts essentially tie them\nto that individual\u2019s actions, movements, and intentions. Yet\nit\u2019s not entirely clear how this picture would mesh with the\nother accounts and phenomena discussed in this section;\nAnscombe\u2019s framing of the issues is different from the one\nabove, and she is explicit that she\u2019s not talking about\ntraditional IEM phenomena such as \u201cI have a headache\u201d.\n",
