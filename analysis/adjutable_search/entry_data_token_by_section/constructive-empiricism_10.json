    "main_text": "Arguments For Constructive Empiricism || The Pragmatics of Theory Choice\n2.4 The Pragmatics of Theory Choice\n\nAnother way in which, according to the constructive empiricist,\nconstructive empiricism makes better sense of science than realism\ndoes has to do with theory choice. Some virtues that scientists see in\ntheories are pragmatic virtues, not epistemic virtues. This shows that\nscientists are choosing between theories using criteria other than\ntruth.\n\nWhat virtues are pragmatic? Here is what van Fraassen says:\n\nWhen a theory is advocated, it is praised for many features other than\nempirical adequacy and strength: it is said to be mathematically\nelegant, simple, of great scope, complete in certain respects:\nalso of wonderful use in unifying our account of hitherto\ndisparate phenomena, and most of all, explanatory. (1980, 87)\n\n\nSome scientific realists might hold that some of these are epistemic\nvirtues, not pragmatic virtues. With regard to simplicity, the\nconstructive empiricist can recognize that scientific realists\nsometimes hold that simpler theories are more likely to be true, but\nat the same time the constructive empiricist can contend that\n\nit is surely absurd to think that the world is more likely to be\nsimple than complicated (unless one has certain metaphysical or\ntheological views not usually accepted as legitimate factors in\nscientific inference). (1980, 90)\n\n\nWith regard to explanation, constructive empiricists recognize that\nscientific realists typically attach an objective validity to requests\nfor explanation (van Fraassen 1980, 13), but constructive empiricists\ndo not grant that objective validity. Van Fraassen\u2019s arguments\nthat explanation is pragmatic constitute a significant part of The\nScientific Image, and will be discussed in the next\nsubsection.\n\nConstructive empiricists recognize that these pragmatic factors like\nsimplicity and explanatory power are important guides in the pursuit\nof the aim of science (van Fraassen 1980, 89). But they insist that\nthese factors are valuable in that pursuit only insofar as their\nconsideration advances the development of theories that are\nempirically adequate and empirically strong. The factors do not have\nspecial value as indicators of the truth of what the theories say\nabout the unobservable parts of the world.\n",
