    "main_text": "Further challenges || Consistency and coherence\n5.3 Logic vs. probability theory\n\nEven if there is a plausible sense in which logic can be said to be\nnormative for thought or reasoning, there remains a worry about\ncompetition. Logic-based norms usually target full beliefs. If that\nis correct, a significant range of rationally assessable doxastic\nphenomena fall outside of the purview of logic\u2014most\nsignificantly for present purposes, degrees of\n belief.[23]\n Degrees of belief, according to the popular probabilist picture, are\nsubject not to logical, but to probabilistic norms, in particular the\nsynchronic norm of probabilistic\n coherence.[24]\n Consequently, the normative reach of logic would seem (at best) to be limited;\nit does not exhaust the range of doxastic phenomena.\n\nWorse still, some philosophers maintain that degrees of belief are the\nonly doxastic attitudes that are, in some sense, \u201creal\u201d,\nor at least the only ones that genuinely matter. According to them,\nonly degrees of belief are deserving of a place in our most promising\naccounts of both theoretical (broadly Bayesian) and practical (broadly\ndecision-theoretic) accounts of rationality. Full belief talk is\neither to be eliminated altogether (Jeffrey 1970), or reduced to talk\nof degrees of belief (ontologically, explanatorily or otherwise).\nOthers still acknowledge that the concept of full belief plays an\nindispensable role in our folk-psychological practices, but\nnevertheless deem it to be too blunt an instrument to earn its keep in\nrespectable philosophical and scientific theorizing (Christensen\n2004). Virtually all such \u201ccredence-first\u201d approaches have\nin common that they threaten to eliminate the normative role of logic,\nwhich is superseded or \u201cembedded\u201d (Williams 2015) in\nprobabilism.\n\nA number of replies might be envisaged. Here we mention but a few.\nFirst, one may question the assumption that logical norms really have\nno say when it comes to credences. Field\u2019s quantitative bridge\nprinciple is a case in point. As we have seen, it does directly\nconnect logical principles (or our attitudes towards them) with\nconstraints on the allowable ways of investing confidence in the\npropositions in question. To this it might be retorted, however, that\nField\u2019s proposal in effect presupposes some (possibly\nnon-classical) form of subjective probability theory. After all, in\norder to align one\u2019s credences with the demands of logic, one\nmust be capable of determining the numerical values of one\u2019s\ncredences in logically complex propositions on the basis of\none\u2019s degrees of belief in simple propositions. This is most\nnaturally done by appealing to probability\n theory.[25]\n But if so, it looks as if probability theory is really doing all of\nthe normative work and hence that logic would seem to be little more\nthan a redundant tag-along. Second, one might try to downplay the\nimportance of degrees of belief in our cognitive economy. In its\nstrongest form such a position amounts to a form of eliminativism or\nreduction in the opposite direction: against credences and in favor of\nfull belief. Harman (1986), for instance, rejects the idea that\nordinary agents operate with anything like credences. Harman does not\ndeny that beliefs may come in varying degrees of strength. However, he\nmaintains that this feature can be explained wholly in terms of full\nbeliefs: either as belief in a proposition whose content is\nprobabilistic or else \n\n\nas a kind of epiphenomenon resulting from the operation of rules of\nrevision [e.g., you believe \\(P\\) to a higher degree than \\(Q\\) iff it\nis harder to stop believing \\(P\\) than to stop believing \\(Q\\)].\n(Harman 1986: 22) \n\n\nMore moderate positions accord both graded and categorical beliefs\nalong with their respective attendant norms a firm place in our\ncognitive economies, either by seeking to give a unified account of\nboth concepts (Foley 1993; Sturgeon 2008; Leitgeb 2013) or else by\nreconciling themselves to what Christensen (2004) calls a\n\u201cbifurcation account\u201d, i.e., the view that there is no\nunifying account to be had and hence that both types of belief and\ntheir attendant norms operate autonomously (Buchak 2014; Kaplan 1996;\nMaher 1993; Stalnaker 1984). Summarizing, then, so long, at least, as\nfull belief continues to occupy an ineliminable theoretical role to in\nour best theories, there still is a case to be made that it is to\nlogic that we should continue to look in seeking to articulate the\nnorms governing these qualitative doxastic states.\n",
