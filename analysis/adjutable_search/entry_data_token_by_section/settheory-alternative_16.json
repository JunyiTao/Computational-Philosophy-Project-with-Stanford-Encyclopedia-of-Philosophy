An advantage, which corresponds to one of the few clear\ndisadvantages of Zermelo set theory, is that it is possible to define\nnatural numbers, cardinal numbers, and ordinal numbers in the natural\nway intended by Frege, Russell, and Whitehead.\n\nMany but not all of the purported disadvantages of NFU as a\nworking foundation for mathematics reduce to complaints by\nmathematicians used to working in ZFC that \u201cthis is not\nwhat we are used to\u201d. The fact that there are fewer singletons\nthan objects (in spite of an obvious external one to one\ncorrespondence) takes getting used to. In otherwise familiar\nconstructions, one sometimes has to make technical use of the\nsingleton map or \\(T\\) operations to adjust types to get\nstratification. This author can testify that it is perfectly possible\nto develop good intuition for NFU and work effectively with\nstratified comprehension; part of this but not all of it is a good\nfamiliarity with how things are done in TST, as one also has\nto develop a feel for how to use principles that subvert\nstratification.\n\nAs Sol Feferman has pointed out, one place where the treatments in\nNFU (at least those given so far) are clearly quite involved\nare situations in which one needs to work with indexed families of\nobjects. The proof of K\u00f6nig\u2019s Lemma of set theory in Holmes\n1998 is a good example of how complicated this kind of thing can get\nin NFU. We have a notion that the use of sets of \u201cQuine\natoms\u201d (self-singletons) as index sets (necessarily for s.c.\nsets) might relieve this difficulty, but we haven\u2019t proved this\nin practice, and problems would remain for the noncantorian\nsituation.\n\nThe fact that \u201cNFU has no standard models\u201d (the\nordinals are not well-ordered in any set model of NFU) is a\ncriticism of NFU which has merit. We observe, though, that\nthere are other set theories in which nonstandard objects are\ndeliberately provided (we will review some of these below), and some\nof the applications of those set theories to \u201cnonstandard\nanalysis\u201d might be duplicated in suitable versions of\nNFU. We also observe that strong principles which minimize\nthe nonstandard behavior of the ordinals turn out to give surprisingly\nstrong axioms of infinity in NFU; the nonstandard structure\nof the ordinals allows insight into phenomena associated with large\ncardinals.\n\nSome have thought that the fact that NFU combines a universal\nset and other big structures with mathematical fluency in treating\nthese structures might make it a suitable medium for category theory.\nAlthough we have some inclination to be partial to this class of set\ntheories, we note that there are strong counterarguments to this view.\nIt is true that there are big categories, such as the category of all\nsets (as objects) and functions (as the morphisms between them), the\ncategory of all topological spaces and homeomorphism, and even the\ncategory of all categories and functors. However, the category of all\nsets and functions, for example, while it is a set, is not\n\u201ccartesian closed\u201d (a technical property which this\ncategory is expected to have): see McLarty 1992. Moreover, if one\nrestricts to the s.c. sets and functions, one obtains a cartesian\nclosed category, which is much more closely analogous to the category\nof all sets and functions over ZFC\u2014and shares with it\nthe disadvantage of being a proper class! Contemplation of the models\nonly confirms the impression that the correct analogue of the proper\nclass category of sets and functions in ZFC is the proper\nclass category of s.c. sets and functions in NFU! There may\nbe some applications for the big set categories in NFU, but\nthey are not likely to prove to be as useful as some have\noptimistically suggested. See Feferman 2006 for an extensive\ndiscussion.\n\nAn important point is that there is a relativity of viewpoint here:\nthe NFU world can be understood to be a nonstandard initial\nsegment of the world of ZFC (which could be arranged to\ninclude its entire standard part!) with an automorphism and the\nZFC world (or an initial segment of it) can be interpreted in\nNFU as the theory of isomorphism classes of well-founded\nextensional relations with top (often restricted to its strongly\ncantorian part); these two theories are mutually interpretable, so the\ncorresponding views of the world admit mutual translation.\n\nZFC might be viewed as motivated by a generalization of the\ntheory of sets in extension (as generalizations of the notion of\nfinite set, replacing the finite with the transfinite and the rejected\ninfinite with the rejected Absolute Infinite of Cantor) while the\nmotivation of NFU can be seen as a correction of the theory\nof sets as intensions (that is, as determined by predicates) which led\nto the disaster of naive set theory. Nino Cocchiarella (1985) has\nnoted that Frege\u2019s theory of concepts could be saved if one\ncould motivate a restriction to stratified concepts (the abandonment\nof strong extensionality is merely a return to common sense). But the\nimpression of a fundamental contrast should be tempered by the\nobservation that the two theories nonetheless seem to be looking at\nthe same universe in different ways!\n",
