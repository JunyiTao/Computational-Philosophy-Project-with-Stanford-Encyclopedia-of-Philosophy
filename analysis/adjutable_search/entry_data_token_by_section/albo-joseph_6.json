    "main_text": "The Theory of Humanity\n7. The Theory of Humanity\n\n\nThe central discussion on the theory of humanity in Sefer\nha-\u2018Ikkarim is located in the third treatise, which covers\nthe principle of Torah from heaven and its roots. The philosophical\nissue present throughout the sections of this treatise is that of the\nnature of human perfection. To put it mildly, Albo\u2019s discussion on this\ntopic has not merited intensive treatment in the academic literature.\nAside from this concept, the treatise addresses in depth the idea of\nprophecy and several aspects of the Torah of Moses and its\ncommandments. In one section of his discussion on the last topic, Albo\nresponds to the attacks of a Christian scholar on the Torah of Moses,\nincluding both apologetic and polemic elements in his rejoinders.\n\n\nIn the introductory chapters of the third treatise, Albo criticizes\nthe position of the rationalist Jewish philosophers, who associated\nhuman perfection with the level of individual intellectual\nachievement.  In contrast to this approach, Albo proposes a\nconservative theory, arguing that human perfection depends on the\nfulfillment of the Torah\u2019s commandments, in other words, the practical\nworship of God (treatise 3, chapters 1\u20137). Yet on this subject\nas well, we note considerable internal contradictions, which we will\nillustrate with several examples. Firstly, in the first treatise of\nhis book, Albo clearly determines that human perfection depends on\nfaith in God and in the principles of divine law (treatise 1, chapters\n21\u201322). Secondly, in several places in the book he diminishes\nthe value of the practical element of fulfilling the commandments of\nthe Torah, and emphasizes in its stead the element of awareness, or\nintent (treatise 3, chapters 28\u201329). A third contradiction is\nfound in the final chapters of the third treatise, which analyze the\nconcepts of reverence and love for God. Albo considers these to be\nthe highest levels of divine worship. He defines love of God as an\nintellectual phenomenon whose level depends on the intellectual status\nof the person (treatise 3, chapters 35\u201336; Ehrlich\n2004a). According to the two main theories found in the academic\nliterature, these contradictions may characterize either eclectic or\nesoteric writing.\n\n\nTo Albo, prophecy is not a natural characteristic of the human soul,\nbut rather depends on divine will. God, should He so will, grants\ndivine inspiration to the prophet. His primary purpose in so doing is\nto inform humanity of the commandments so that through them they may\nachieve human perfection (treatise 3, chapter 8). Scholars who have\nstudied Albo\u2019s theory of prophecy have pointed out that it integrates\nboth rationalist elements from Maimonides\u2019 parallel discussion and\nspiritual, supra-intellectual elements from the writings of Rabbi\nJudah Halevi and Crescas on this subject. Some have seen in this\nintegration a demonstration of Albo\u2019s purpose in remaining faithful to\nthe Aristotelian tradition of Maimonides, while attempting (not always\nsuccessfully) to bend it as far as possible in the conservative\ndirection (Schweid 1965). Others have considered this integration an\nexpression of the general problematic character of Albo\u2019s thought that\ndoes not contend with the problems it produces. These scholars also\nargue that Albo\u2019s basic approach is that prophecy transcends the\nnatural, and that this concept is grounded in the deep-seated\ntradition of Jewish thought (Kreisel 2001, 540\u2013543). Here as\nwell, we should not ignore the possibility that the internal\ncontradictions in Albo\u2019s discussion reflect an esoteric writing\nstyle.\n\n\nAlbo distinguishes between various levels of prophecy, with the\ncentral goal of establishing the supremacy of Mosaic prophecy as the\nstarting point for validating Mosaic law as the divine law. According\nto Albo, Moses is the most exalted prophet, for only in his case did\ndivine inspiration directly reach the intellectual power of his soul,\nwithout the mediation of the imagination. The significance of this\nproclamation is that only for Moses\u2019 prophecy is there no doubt\nregarding the validity of its content (treatise 3, chapters\n8\u201310). Albo also claims that at the giving of the Torah on Mt.\nSinai, the Israelites all received prophetic inspiration; however, they\nwere not on the prophetic level, and this is in support of Moses\u2019\nadvanced status (treatise 3, chapter 11).\n\n\nAfter discussing the prophecy of Moses, Albo takes up the topic of the\ndivine Torah that Moses gave to the people of Israel. He treats a\nnumber of aspects of this issue, such as the classification of the\nmitzvot (commandments), the status of the Ten Commandments,\nand the importance of the Oral Law. Yet apparently, the thrust of his\nefforts is directed toward establishing the idea of the eternity of\nthe Torah, apparently in response to the Jewish-Christian polemic on\nthis topic. Remaining faithful to his dogmatic method, Albo argues\nthat in Mosaic law, and in divine law in general, changes in the\ndetails of the commandments may take place, but their fundamental\nprinciples cannot change (treatise 3, chapters 13\u201322).\n\n\nWithin his discussion on Mosaic law, Albo includes a chapter\ndescribing its condemnation by an anonymous Christian scholar\n(treatise 3, chapter 25). The Christian contends that in every\npossible parameter, the religion of Jesus supersedes Mosaic law, and\nAlbo replies to this assault in detail. The present forum is too\nlimited to specify the content of this polemic, but suffice it to say\nthat this chapter in particular reflects Albo\u2019s quite extensive\nknowledge of the Christian religion. He demonstrates proficiency in\nChristian writings, and in addition, he recognizes the internal\ntension within Christianity between the papacy and the Roman\nEmpire. He reveals knowledge of Church history, and finally, he\nchallenges the central Christian doctrines (the Trinity,\ntransubstantiation, and the virgin birth) while describing them in\ndetail. It should be noted that Albo\u2019s polemic against Christianity is\nnot limited to this chapter, but runs throughout the book, both\nexplicitly and implicitly (Schweid 1968; Lasker 1977, cf. index\n[\u201cAlbo, Joseph\u201d]; Rauschenbach 2002, 142\u2013156).\n",
