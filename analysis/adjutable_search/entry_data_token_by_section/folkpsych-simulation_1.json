What is Meant by \u201cMental Simulation\u201d?\n\nIn common parlance, we talk of putting ourselves in others\u2019\nshoes, or empathizing with other people. This talk is typically\nunderstood as adopting someone else\u2019s point of view, or\nperspective, in our imagination. For example, it is quite natural to\ninterpret the request \u201cTry to show some empathy for John!\u201d\nas asking you to use your imaginative capacity to consider the world\nfrom John\u2019s perspective. But what is it for someone to\nimaginatively adopt someone else\u2019s perspective? To a first\napproximation, according to Simulation Theorists, it consists of\nmentally simulating, or re-creating, someone\nelse\u2019s mental states. Currie and Ravenscroft (2002) make this\npoint quite nicely: \n\n\nImagination enables us to project ourselves into another situation and\nto see, or think about, the world from another perspective. These\nsituations and perspectives \u2026 might be those of another actual\nperson, [or] the perspective we would have on things if we believed\nsomething we actually don\u2019t believe, [or] that of a fictional\ncharacter. \u2026 Imagination recreates the mental states of\nothers. (Currie & Ravenscroft 2002: 1, emphasis added). \n\n\nThus, according to ST, empathizing with John\u2019s sadness consists\nof mentally simulating his sadness, and adopting Mary\u2019s\npolitical point of view consists of mentally simulating her political\nbeliefs. This is the intuitive and general sense of mental\nsimulation that Simulation Theorists have in mind.\n\nNeedless to say, this intuitive characterization of \u201cmental\nsimulation\u201d is loose. What exactly does it mean to say that a\nmental state is a mental simulation of another mental state? Clearly,\nwe need a precise answer to this question, if the notion of mental\nsimulation is to be the fundamental building block of a theory.\nSimulation Theorists, however, differ over how to answer this\nquestion. The central divide concerns whether \u201cmental\nsimulation\u201d should be defined in terms of resemblance\n(Heal 1986, 2003; Goldman 2006, 2008a) or in terms of reuse\n(Hurley 2004, 2008; Gallese & Sinigaglia 2011). We consider these\ntwo proposals in turn.\n",
