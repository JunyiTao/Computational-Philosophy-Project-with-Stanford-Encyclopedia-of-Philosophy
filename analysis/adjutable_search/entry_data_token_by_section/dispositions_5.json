    "main_text": "Analyses of Disposition Ascriptions || Analyzing Conventional Dispositions\n1.5 Analyzing Conventional Dispositions\n\nWe have thus far surveyed a variety of conceptual analyses of\ncanonical dispositions that involve explicit references to their\nstimulus conditions and manifestations. This corresponds to the second\nstep in Lewis\u2019s two-step approach (see\n section 1.1).\n But they by themselves do not tell us how to understand conceptually\nconventional dispositions like fragility, flammability, conductivity,\netc., that do not involve such explicit references. Here it might be\nsuggested that, given that conventional dispositions are the ones we\nare most familiar with and find most useful in everyday or scientific\ncontexts, our understanding of dispositions will remain incomplete\nunless we have obtained a full-blooded analysis of conventional\ndispositions. In fact, although the apparent counterexamples to\nSCA were presented in terms\nof canonical dispositions in the preceding\nsections, they are often presented in terms\nof conventional dispositions. On this construal,\nthe simple conditional analysis is thought of as an analysis of\nconventional dispositions. For instance, the simple conditional\nanalysis of fragility is understood as saying\nthat \\(x\\) is fragile at \\(t\\) iff\nit would break if struck at \\(t\\); and this analysis is\nclaimed to be toppled, for example, by a carefully packed glass that\nremains fragile but would not break if struck. Thus the alleged\ncounterexamples are often described as concerning the issue of how to\nlink conventional dispositions with counterfactual conditionals. We\nnoted earlier, though, that, to tackle this issue, we need define\nconventional dispositions into (groups of) canonical dispositions by\nspecifying their stimulus conditions and manifestations, which\ncorresponds to the first step in Lewis\u2019s two-step approach. With this\nin mind, we will inquire into the issue of how to specify the stimulus\nconditions and manifestations of conventional dispositions and other\nrelated issues.\n\nLet us start by unraveling\nseveral different notions of stimulus condition.\nMary utters \u2018Arsenic is poisonous\u2019. What is the stimulus\ncondition of the disposition expressed by \u2018poisonous\u2019? An\nimpromptu answer would be the event of being ingested. In most normal\ncontexts of utterance, however, what she means is that arsenic is\npoisonous to humans. So, given this context of utterance, the\nstimulus condition can be said to be the event of being ingested\nby a human being (Prior 1985, chapter 1). This second\nstimulus condition can be identified by making explicit the context\u2019s\ncontribution to the content of the stimulus condition. As we will see,\nfurthermore, it has been suggested that the stimulus condition is not\nthe simple event of being ingested but the event of being ingested\nwithout finks, maskers, and so forth. Here the condition of\nthe absence of finks, maskers, and so forth seems to come not from the\ncontext of utterance but from the context-independent meaning of being\npoisonous (Choi 2011a, 2011b). There are thus many different notions\nof stimulus condition although they are not miles away from each\nother. One says \u2018My mobile phone set is fragile\u2019. The\nstimulus condition could be any of its being struck, its being struck\nwith a soft blow, its being struck without finks, maskers, and so\nforth.\n\nThis disambiguation is of much value when we articulate the notion of\n\u2018multi-track\u2019 disposition. There seems to be a general\nagreement that there are so-called \u2018multi-track\u2019\nconventional dispositions that correspond to more than one pair of\nstimulus condition and manifestation (Ryle 1949, pp. 43\u201345; Bird\n2005a, p. 367; Bird 2007a, pp. 21\u201324; Ellis & Lierse 1994,\np. 29; Williams 2011, pp. 85\u20137; Vetter 2013). The thought is that\nexactly the same conventional dispositions may be picked out by\nmultiple characterisations in terms of stimulus condition and\nmanifestation. However, caution is required when we decide if a given\ndisposition is multi-track or not. First of all, a single notion of\nstimulus condition must be in use: it is wrong to infer that the\nproperty of being poisonous is a multi-track disposition, from the\nfact that its stimulus condition could be being ingested, being\ningested by humans, being ingested without finks, maskers, and so on.\nFurther, we must hold the context of utterance fixed: it is wrong to\ninfer that the property of being poisonous is multi-track, from the\nfact that its stimulus condition could be being ingested by humans,\nbeing ingested by dogs, being ingested by birds, and so on. The\nexpression \u2018poisonous\u2019 is context-sensitive with respect\nto who \\(x\\) is poisonous to, referring to different dispositions\nrelative to different contexts of utterance. Hence stimulus conditions\nlike \\(x\\)\u2019s being ingested by humans, \\(x\\)\u2019s\nbeing ingested by dogs, etc., are not stimulus conditions of\nthe same disposition. And hence they don\u2019t have to\ndo with the issue of whether or not a given disposition is\nmulti-track.\n\nIt is not universally agreed that dispositions are typically\nmulti-track. Lowe (2010, pp. 10\u201311) insists that dispositions can\u2019t be\nmulti-track. A majority of metaphysicians, however, lean toward the\nmulti-track character of dispositions. Being electrically charged, an\nelectron is disposed to experience an electrostatic\nforce \\(F\\) in response to being placed at a\ndistance \\(d\\) away from an electric\ncharge \\(q\\) but it is also disposed to experience an\nelectrostatic force \\(F^*\\) in response to being placed\nat a distance \\(d^*\\) away from an electric\ncharge \\(q^*\\). Similarly, it might be plausibly claimed that\nfragility is a multi-track disposition with many different stimulus\nconditions: \\(x\\)\u2019s being struck, \\(x\\)\u2019s being\nstressed, \\(x\\)\u2019s being twisted, \\(x\\)\u2019s being\nshaken, and so on. Indeed, whilst Cartwright\u2019s (1999, pp. 59, 64)\nnotion of capacity is akin to the notion of multi-track disposition\n(cf. Teller 2002, pp. 717\u2013718), electric charge being a paradigm\nexample of capacity in Cartwright\u2019s sense, she maintains that\ncapacities are real properties and that reference to capacities is\nessential in the operation of science: scientific laws are nothing but\nexpressions of what capacities exist and how they work together. On\nCartwright\u2019s view, hence, not only do multi-track dispositions exist\nbut it is their nature that science aims to unveil.\n\nVetter (2013) goes a step further to argue that the extent of the\nmulti-track character of dispositions is severely underestimated,\nexploiting what she calls the problems of qualitative diversity and\nquantitative diversity. It is noteworthy that this consideration is\nused as a stepping stone for her possibility conception of\ndispositionality. The thought is that, given that there is an extreme\nvariety of stimulus conditions of \\(D\\) and that there is no\nprivileged subset of them with respect to the question of whether\n\\(x\\) instantiates \\(D\\) or not, we\u2019d better embrace\ndispositions without stimulus conditions (Vetter 2014, p. 132).\n\nBe that as it may, however, we will leave behind multi-track\ndispositions, for, seeking a conceptual analysis of them raises many\ndifficult questions that would take us far afield. In what follows, we\nwill instead focus on single-track conventional dispositions that\ncorrespond to a unique pair of stimulus condition and manifestation,\nor alternatively we will simply assume that all conventional\ndispositions are single-track. We hope, though, the subsequent\ndiscussion will shed light on the issue of how to analyze multi-track\ndispositions.\n\nWhat are the stimulus condition and manifestation of a given\nconventional disposition? It is generally held that any specification\nof the stimulus condition of a conventional disposition must include\ncovert reference to a ceteris paribus clause (Prior\n1985; Lewis 1997; Bird 1998; Mumford 1998; Mellor 2000; Malzkorn 2000;\nCross 2005; Choi 2006, 2008; Hauska 2008b; Steinberg 2010): fragility,\nfor example, is defined not as the canonical disposition to break when\nstruck but rather as the canonical disposition to break when\nstruck under certain standard conditions. For the sake\nof simplicity, let us combine this definition with SCA. Then it follows that\n\u2018\\(x\\) is fragile\u2019 is to be analyzed into\n\u2018If \\(x\\) were struck under certain standard\nconditions it would break\u2019 or\n\u2018If \\(x\\) were struck then, ceteris\nparibus, it would break\u2019. Recall that, in each of the\nalleged counterexamples to SCA, a fragile thing but not\na non-fragile thing would break if struck in the absence of finks,\nreverse-cycle finks, maskers, mimickers, and so on. To the extent to\nwhich cases of finks, reverse-cycle finks, etc., are non-standard,\ntherefore, the ceteris paribus clause ensures that\n\u2018\\(x\\) is fragile\u2019 has the same truth value as\nthe associated counterfactual conditional in every case, thereby\nblocking the counterexamples.\n\nBut serious doubts have been raised as to how to spell out\nthe ceteris paribus clause in a way that fits the\nbill. It is even claimed that the only way to spell it out in such a\nway is to render the proposed analysis vacuous. For, on\nthe intended reading of the ceteris paribus clause,\nto say that if \\(x\\) were struck, then ceteris\nparibus it would break seems to be simply to say that if it\nwere struck then, unless it didn\u2019t break, it would break, which is\nvacuously true (Martin 1994; Bird 1998; Mumford 1998, 2001; Fara 2005\nand Hauska 2008b) See Mellor 2000 and Steinberg 2010 for the view that\nthe risk of vacuity is unproblematic. See also Choi 2008 and Steinberg\n& Steinberg 2017 for an attempt to spell out the ceteris\nparibus clauses in a way that does not render the resulting\nconditionals vacuous.\n\nThe task of analyzing conventional dispositions poses no additional\nchallenge to Manley & Wasserman\u2019s approach or Vetter\u2019s approach,\nadditional to those challenges posed by the task of analyzing\ncanonical dispositions. They handle the problems of finks, maskers,\nmimickers, etc., not by ruling them out from the stimulus condition\nbut by exploiting the \u2018suitable proportion\u2019 requirement.\nThey can thereby stick to the simple definition of fragility as the\ndisposition to break when struck (Manley & Wasserman) or as the\ndisposition to break (Vetter). From their respective analysis of\ncanonical dispositions, then, they can readily derive an analysis of\nconventional dispositions like fragility that does away with\nceteris paribus clauses.\n",
