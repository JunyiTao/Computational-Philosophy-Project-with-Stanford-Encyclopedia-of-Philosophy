    "main_text": "Arguments Against Constructive Empiricism || Why Not Just Believe in Sense Data?\n3.6 Why Not Just Believe in Sense Data?\n\nAn objection related to the one from section 3.4 is the following. The\nconstructive empiricist errs not just in believing claims about what\nis unobservable-but-not-actually-observed, but also in believing\nclaims about actually observed entities the likes of macroscopic\nphysical objects. If one really takes to heart the advice that\none\u2019s beliefs should not extend beyond one\u2019s evidence,\nthen one should limit belief to claims about the mental experiences\nthat one is having.\n\nA constructive empiricist might reply to the objection as follows:\n\nSuch events as experiences, and such entities as sense-data, when they\nare not already understood in the framework of observable phenomena\nordinarily recognized, are theoretical entities. They are, what is\nworse, the theoretical entities of an armchair psychology that cannot\neven rightfully claim to be scientific. I wish merely to be agnostic\nabout the existence of the unobservable aspects of the world described\nby science\u2014but sense-data, I am sure, do not exist. (van\nFraassen 1980, 72)\n\n",
