    "main_text": "The Explosive Growth of AI || The Resurgence of Neurocomputational Techniques\n4.2 The Resurgence of Neurocomputational Techniques\n\nOne of the remarkable aspects of (Charniak & McDermott 1985) is\nthis: The authors say the central dogma of AI is that \u201cWhat the\nbrain does may be thought of at some level as a kind of\ncomputation\u201d (p. 6). And yet nowhere in the book is brain-like\ncomputation discussed. In fact, you will search the index in vain for\nthe term \u2018neural\u2019 and its variants. Please note that the\nauthors are not to blame for this. A large part of AI\u2019s growth\nhas come from formalisms, tools, and techniques that are, in some\nsense, brain-based, not logic-based. A paper that conveys the\nimportance and maturity of neurocomputation is (Litt et al. 2006).\n(Growth has also come from a return of probabilistic techniques that\nhad withered by the mid-70s and 80s. More about that momentarily, in\nthe next \u201cresurgence\u201d\n section.)\n \n\nOne very prominent class of non-logicist formalism does make an\nexplicit nod in the direction of the brain: viz., artificial neural\nnetworks (or as they are often simply called, neural\nnetworks, or even just neural nets). (The structure of\nneural networks and more recent developments are discussed\n above).\n Because Minsky and Pappert\u2019s (1969) Perceptrons led many\n(including, specifically, many sponsors of AI research and\ndevelopment) to conclude that neural networks didn\u2019t have\nsufficient information-processing power to model human cognition, the\nformalism was pretty much universally dropped from AI. However, Minsky\nand Pappert had only considered very limited neural networks.\nConnectionism, the view that intelligence consists not in\nsymbolic processing, but rather non-symbolic processing at\nleast somewhat like what we find in the brain (at least at the\ncellular level), approximated specifically by artificial neural\nnetworks, came roaring back in the early 1980s on the strength of more\nsophisticated forms of such networks, and soon the situation was (to\nuse a metaphor introduced by John McCarthy) that of two horses in a\nrace toward building truly intelligent agents.\n\nIf one had to pick a year at which connectionism was resurrected, it\nwould certainly be 1986, the year Parallel Distributed\nProcessing (Rumelhart & McClelland 1986) appeared in print.\nThe rebirth of connectionism was specifically fueled by the\nback-propagation (backpropagation) algorithm over neural networks,\nnicely covered in Chapter 20 of AIMA. The\nsymbolicist/connectionist race led to a spate of lively debate in the\nliterature (e.g., Smolensky 1988, Bringsjord 1991), and some AI\nengineers have explicitly championed a methodology marked by a\nrejection of knowledge representation and reasoning. For example,\nRodney Brooks was such an engineer; he wrote the well-known\n\u201cIntelligence Without Representation\u201d (1991), and his Cog\nProject, to which we referred above, is arguably an incarnation of the\npremeditatedly non-logicist approach. Increasingly, however, those in\nthe business of building sophisticated systems find that both\nlogicist and more neurocomputational techniques are required (Wermter\n& Sun\n 2001).[33]\n In addition, the neurocomputational paradigm today includes\nconnectionism only as a proper part, in light of the fact that some of\nthose working on building intelligent systems strive to do so by\nengineering brain-based computation outside the neural network-based\napproach (e.g., Granger 2004a, 2004b). \n\nAnother recent resurgence in neurocomputational techniques has\noccurred in machine learning. The modus operandi in machine learning\nis that given a problem, say recognizing handwritten digits\n\\(\\{0,1,\\ldots,9\\}\\) or faces, from a 2D matrix representing an image\nof the digits or faces, a machine learning or a domain expert would\nconstruct a feature vector representation function for the\ntask. This function is a transformation of the input into a format\nthat tries to throw away irrelevant information in the input and keep\nonly information useful for the task. Inputs transformed by \\(\\rr\\)\nare termed features. For recognizing faces, irrelevant\ninformation could be the amount of lighting in the scene and relevant\ninformation could be information about facial features. The machine is\nthen fed a sequence of inputs represented by the features and the\nideal or ground truth output values for those inputs. This converts\nthe learning challenge from that of having to learn the function\n\\(\\ff\\) from the examples: \\(\\left\\{\\left\\langle x_1,\n\\ff(x_1)\\right\\rangle,\\left\\langle x_2, \\ff(x_2)\\right\\rangle, \\ldots,\n\\left\\langle x_n, \\ff(x_n)\\right\\rangle \\right\\}\\) to having to learn\nfrom possibly easier data: \\(\\left\\{\\left\\langle \\rr(x_1),\n\\ff(x_1)\\right\\rangle,\\left\\langle \\rr(x_2), \\ff(x_2)\\right\\rangle,\n\\ldots, \\left\\langle \\rr(x_n), \\ff(x_n)\\right\\rangle \\right\\}\\). Here\nthe function \\(\\rr\\) is the function that computes the feature vector\nrepresentation of the input. Formally, \\(\\ff\\) is assumed to be a\ncomposition of the functions \\(\\gg\\) and \\(\\rr\\). That is, for any\ninput \\(x\\), \\(f(x) = \\gg\\left(\\rr\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\). This is\ndenoted by \\(\\ff=\\gg\\circ \\rr\\). For any input, the features are first\ncomputed, and then the function \\(\\gg\\) is applied. If the feature\nrepresentation \\(\\rr\\) is provided by the domain expert, the learning\nproblem becomes simpler to the extent the feature representation takes\non the difficulty of the task. At one extreme, the feature vector\ncould hide an easily extractable form of the answer in the input and\nin the other extreme the feature representation could be just the\nplain input.\n\nFor non-trivial problems, choosing the right representation is vital.\nFor instance, one of the drastic changes in the AI landscape was due\nto Minsky and Papert\u2019s (1969) demonstration that the perceptron\ncannot learn even the binary XOR function, but this function\ncan be learnt by the perceptron if we have the right representation.\nFeature engineering has grown to be one of the most labor intensive\ntasks of machine learning, so much so that it is considered to be one\nof the \u201cblack arts\u201d of machine learning. The other\nsignificant black art of learning methods is choosing the right\nparameters. These black arts require significant human expertise and\nexperience, which can be quite difficult to obtain without significant\napprenticeship (Domingos 2012). Another bigger issue is that the task\nof feature engineering is just knowledge representation in a new skin.\n\n\nGiven this state of affairs, there has been a recent resurgence in\nmethods for automatically learning a feature representation function\n\\(\\rr\\); such methods potentially bypass a large part of human labor\nthat is traditionally required. Such methods are based mostly on what\nare now termed deep neural networks. Such networks are simply\nneural networks with two or more hidden layers. These networks allow\nus to learn a feature function \\(\\rr\\) by using one or more of the\nhidden layers to learn \\(\\rr\\). The general form of learning in which\none learns from the raw sensory data without much hand-based feature\nengineering has now its own term: deep learning. A general and\nyet concise definition (Bengio et al. 2015) is: \n\nDeep learning can safely be regarded as the study of models that\neither involve a greater amount of composition of learned functions or\nlearned concepts than traditional machine learning does. (Bengio et\nal. 2015, Chapter 1)\n\n\nThough the idea has been around for decades, recent innovations\nleading to more efficient learning techniques have made the approach\nmore feasible (Bengio et al. 2013). Deep-learning methods have\nrecently produced state-of-the-art results in image recognition (given\nan image containing various objects, label the objects from a given\nset of labels), speech recognition (from audio input, generate a\ntextual representation), and the analysis of data from particle\naccelerators (LeCun et al. 2015). Despite impressive results in tasks\nsuch as these, minor and major issues remain unresolved. A minor issue\nis that significant human expertise is still needed to choose an\narchitecture and set up the right parameters for the architecture; a\nmajor issue is the existence of so-called adversarial inputs,\nwhich are indistinguishable from normal inputs to humans but are\ncomputed in a special manner that makes a neural network regard them\nas different than similar inputs in the training data. The existence\nof such adversarial inputs, which remain stable across training data,\nhas raised doubts about how well performance on benchmarks can\ntranslate into performance in real-world systems with sensory noise\n(Szegedy et al. 2014).\n",
