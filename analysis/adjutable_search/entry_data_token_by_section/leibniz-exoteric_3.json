    "main_text": "Eclecticism and Exoteric Philosophy\n4. Eclecticism and Exoteric Philosophy\n\nLeibniz is sometimes described as being an eclectic philosopher. There\nare different ways of understanding eclecticism, but the basic idea is\nthat an eclectic philosopher is one who incorporates ideas from a wide\nrange of sources. In certain places Leibniz characterizes himself as\nproceeding along these lines. He famously writes to Remond, for\nexample, that:\n\n\nI have tried to uncover and unite the truth buried and scattered under\nthe opinions of all the philosophical sects, and I believe I have\nadded something of my own that takes a few steps forward\u2026most\nsects are right in a good part of what they affirm, but not so much in\nwhat they deny. (10 Jan 1714, G 3:606\u20137; L 654)\n\n\nIt is undeniable that Leibniz read from an extraordinary range of\nsources and that his thought was influenced by a number of these\ntexts. Although the precise nature of these influences is a matter of\nscholarly controversy that cannot be engaged in this article, it is\nimportant to note that Leibniz\u2019s exoteric strategies bear\nsignificantly on this general topic. Recall the final sentence in the\nlong quotation from Leibniz\u2019s 1676 notes on exoteric philosophy:\n\n\n\nIn this metaphysics, it will be useful for there to be added here and\nthere the authoritative utterances of great men, who have reasoned in\na similar way; especially when these utterances contain something that\nseems to have some possible relevance to the illustration of a view.\n(A VI.iii.573)\n\n\nAppealing to similarities between his views and those of his\npredecessors is one of Leibniz\u2019s strategies for presenting his\nphilosophy in a way that makes it seem to be not too far from received\nopinions. We need to remain open to the possibility that\nLeibniz\u2019s proclamations of continuity between his thought and\nthe thought of his philosophical forebears often mask subtle or not so\nsubtle differences between their respective views. Nuanced differences\nand radical implications may be left implicit or omitted entirely in\nhis more exoteric works. One might put the point as follows. Leibniz\nis not merely finding ideas in other philosophers and incorporating\nthem whole cloth into his philosophical system. In some cases, at\nleast, Leibniz develops distinctive philosophical views and then seeks\nout similar ideas in his predecessors as a strategy for presenting his\nviews to the public (see Schepers 2008 and Mercer 2001: 23\u201359\nfor more on this topic).\n",
