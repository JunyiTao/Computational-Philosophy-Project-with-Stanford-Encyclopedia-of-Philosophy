    "main_text": "F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s ontology: the Book of Letters and On the One and Unity || On the One and Unity: senses of unity, different relations between one and many, and the circumscription of a thing by its quiddity\n4. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s philosophical theology: the Perfect City and Political Regime\n\nFinally, we turn to metaphysical texts where F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ntries to do what in the Enumeration of the Sciences he says\nthat the \u201cthird part of the divine science\u201d does: namely,\nto show that there are beings separate from bodies, culminating in a\nfirst uncaused being which has no partner and no contrary, contains no\nmultiplicity, is one, being, and true in a stronger sense than\neverything else, is the first cause of existence, unity and truth to\neverything else, and satisfies (some interpretation of) the other\ntraditional divine attributes; and then to show how this first being\nacts to produce other beings directly or indirectly, and how its\naction relates to\n theirs.[37]\n This is also what F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee more briefly says in the\nAims of the Metaphysics that Aristotle does in\nMetaphysics XII:\n\n\nThe eleventh book [i.e., Book XII on our numbering] is about the\nprinciple of substance and of all existence, its existence and the\nconfirmation that it is knowing by its essence and true by its\nessence, and about the separate beings which are after it, and about\nhow the existence of beings depends on it.\n\n\nPresumably F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that Aristotle drew these\nconclusions on the basis of his analyses of the senses of being and\nunity, of the ways in which one kind of being [mawj\u00fbd]\ncould be prior to another being, of what a being\u2019s existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] is, of how one being can cause existence to\nanother being, and so on. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee himself undertakes\nsuch analyses in his Book of Letters and On the One,\nand in one section of the Book of Letters he sketches in a\npurely hypothetical way how they might lead to a first being that is\nbeing in the strongest sense.\n\nHowever, the two extant books where F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee tries to\ncarry out this part of metaphysics, the Perfect City and the\nPolitical Regime, are of a rather different character from\nthe texts that he wrote for an audience within the Baghdad\nphilosophical school, engaging with Aristotle\u2019s texts and trying\nto rewrite them for a modern audience. Neither of these books is\ndevoted exclusively to metaphysics: each first gives a long account of\nGod as first cause, and then an account of the heavenly and sublunar\nthings that proceed from God, before focussing on the human soul,\nhuman societies and their governance, prophecy, and the conditions for\nthe soul\u2019s successful \u201creturn\u201d to God or for more or\nless satisfactory approximations. Especially in the Perfect\nCity it is clear that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is adopting an\noverall sequence of topics from kal\u00e2m treatises, and is\ntrying to show that the methods of falsafa allow him to give\na scientific content to the knowledge of God, and a demonstrative\nresolution of the issues in dispute, which in his view the methods of\nkal\u00e2m cannot. The full titles of the two texts, the\nPrinciples of the Opinions of the People of the Perfect City\nand the Political Regime known as \u201cPrinciples of\nBeings\u201d suggest that he is trying to reconstruct and\nrewrite Plato\u2019s Republic (about which he has only\nindirect information), or perhaps a sequence of several Platonic texts\nincluding the\n Republic.[38]\n In Plato, the thesis that the best society will be ruled by\nphilosophers leads to a discussion of the objects the philosophers\nneed to know, Platonic Forms and especially the Good-itself, and this\nmay give F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee a model for including in these\ntreatises a metaphysical account of the first cause and how other\nthings proceed from it: the rulers of the best society will know these\ntruths, and other members of the society will either believe them\nwithout demonstration, or accept some imitation of\n them.[39]\n But while Plato starts with a discussion of the city and uses it to\nmotivate digressions into metaphysics, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee starts\nat the top, with metaphysics (in the Political Regime with a\nclassification of \u201cprinciples\u201d or non-bodily causes, in\nthe Perfect City with the first cause), with no prior context\nor motivation. He does not frame the metaphysics by saying\nthat this is what the people of the perfect city know or believe.\nRather, he starts from the first cause, explains how the various types\nof being in the cosmos, including human souls, depend on it, and draws\nconclusions about what sort of city would further human perfection and\nwhat its rulers or other inhabitants would have to know or believe:\nthis conforms to the structure of kal\u00e2m treatises,\nwhich typically start with God\u2019s existence and unity and\nattributes and acts, then talk about God\u2019s creation including\nhuman beings, and then about prophecy and the religious community and\nthe afterlife (\u00e2khira) or \u201creturn\u201d\n(ma\u02bf\u00e2d) to\n God.[40]\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not seem to know about the metaphysics\nof the Republic, and in any case it would not give him what\nhe needs. He fills in the content of the metaphysics from elsewhere,\nfrom Metaphysics XII as he would like it to be, guided by\nlater Greek interpreters\u2014Themistius\u2019 commentary, and texts\nof Plotinus and Proclus in their Arabic adaptations. This goes beyond\nthe actual Metaphysics XII both in that it infers to God as a\nfirst cause of existence rather than of motion, and in that it\nincludes a downward way from God to the beings that derive their\nexistence from\n him.[41]\n F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is also much more systematic than Aristotle,\nin the manner of a kal\u00e2m treatise, in showing that God\nis simple, i.e., free from all the different modes of composition, and\nis unique and has no contrary (all things that Metaphysics\nXII does briefly say), and in going through a whole series of\nattributes of God. It is plausible that both treatises are directed to\npotential princely patrons, perhaps after F\u00e2r\u00e2bi\u2019s\ndeparture from Baghdad for Aleppo and Damascus late in his life.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee would be trying to break falsafa out\nof its Christian (or Ism\u00e2\u02bf\u00eel\u00ee) ghetto and to\npresent it as a \u201creligious science\u201d superior to\nkal\u00e2m, not exclusively Muslim but suited for Muslim\nneeds: F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee presents falsafa as giving\nthe content of the ruler\u2019s or his adviser\u2019s religious\nknowledge, and implicitly presents himself as an adviser to\n princes.[42]\n Thus both the Perfect City and the Political Regime\nare supposed to be intelligible to a non-specialist audience. In\nneither case does F\u00e2r\u00e2bi show himself struggling with a\ndifficult Greek model, and while he draws on his technical analyses of\nbeing and unity from the Book of Letters and On the\nOne, this technical substructure is tastefully concealed. The\nPolitical Regime seems to stay closer to\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s Greek\n models,[43]\n and may thus be the earlier of the two texts, while in the\nPerfect City he seems to have more fully digested those\nmodels and to be presenting the results in a simpler and more\nindependent form, concentrating on the elements more central to\npresenting falsafa as a \u201creligious science\u201d to a\ncontemporary Muslim audience. But some passages remain verbally\nidentical or almost identical in the two\n treatises.[44]\n\nBoth treatises put human beings and their societies in an Aristotelian\ncosmological context, which F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee describes in some\ndetail. Humans and other kinds of animals, and also plants, are\ncomposites of some kind of soul (including, for humans, a rational\nsoul) with a body composed out of the four sublunar elements, earth\nand water and air and fire; the whole sublunar world is governed,\nultimately by God, but proximately by a series of nested heavenly\nspheres (each moved by an incorporeal intelligence) and by the\n\u201cactive intelligence\u201d which is a source both of\nintellectual cognition to the human rational soul and of intelligible\norder to the sublunar world. But in what follows I will discuss only\nthe strictly metaphysical parts of these texts, not the cosmology or\nthe theories of the human soul, prophecy, or society. I will mainly\nfollow the Perfect City, while noting some interesting\ndifferences in the Political Regime. The Political\nRegime in general seems more interested in classification and\ncomparison. The human soul is introduced by being compared to various\nhigher and lower things, and the way it achieves its intended\nperfection is compared to the ways they do. Likewise, God is\nintroduced, in the prologue to the Political Regime, on a\nlist of six kinds of incorporeal \u201cprinciples\u201d of physical\nthings, and his causality is compared with the modes of causality of\nthese other\n principles.[45]\n\nThe Perfect City sweeps away this introductory framework, and\nstarts directly with the thesis-statement, \u201cThe first being\n[mawj\u00fbd] is the first cause of existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] to all other beings\n[mawj\u00fbd\u00e2t]\u201d.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s strategy is to argue that there is a\nunique \u201cfirst being\u201d, and then to derive its attributes,\nincluding that it produces other things, and indeed produces\neverything else either directly or indirectly; in the process he hopes\nto have shown that this first being has enough of the traditional\nattributes of God, suitably reinterpreted, that the readers will\nacknowledge it as God. The Perfect City never once uses the\nword \u201cGod\u201d, and this is surely a deliberate strategy. We\ncannot validly deduce \u201cGod exists\u201d, or \u201cGod is\nF\u201d for any value of F, unless we have at least one premise\ncontaining the term \u201cGod\u201d, and no such premises are\navailable. Especially in Islam it is very common to refer to God, not\nby the name \u201cGod\u201d, but by one of his attributes, and\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in the Perfect City consistently\nuses \u201cthe First\u201d, one of the standard Qur\u02be\u00e2nic\nattributes (Q\n 57:3).[46]\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not accompany the initial thesis of the\nPerfect City, \u201cThe first being [mawj\u00fbd]\nis the first cause of existence [wuj\u00fbd] to all other\nbeings [mawj\u00fbd\u00e2t]\u201d, by any explicit proof.\nWhat is his strategy for convincing the reader to accept it? On the\nface of it, there are several ways in which this thesis could be\nfalsified. There might be no first being, because every being has\nanother being prior to it, ad infinitum. Or there might be\nmany beings each of which is \u201cfirst\u201d in the weak sense\nthat it has nothing prior to it; in which case no being will be\n\u201cfirst\u201d in the strong sense that it is prior to everything\nother than itself. (We might also want clarification of what\npriority-relation F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is talking about. He does\nnot explicitly say, but he seems to mean roughly what Aristotle calls\npriority in being by contrast with priority in time and priority in\ndefinition. X is prior to Y in being if X\ncan exist without Y existing but not vice versa, or\nif neither can exist without the other existing but X is the\ncause of Y\u2019s existing.) If there is some X\nwhich is \u201cfirst\u201d in the strong sense that it is prior to\neverything other than itself, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee seems to think\nit will be clear that X is the first cause of existence,\neither immediately or by a chain of intermediate causes, to any other\nbeing Y, because every being other than the first will have\nsome cause (distinct from itself) of its existence, and because, if\n(as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee assumes) there can be no circles or\ninfinite regresses of such causes, the chain of its causes can only\nterminate in the first being X. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says\nnothing here about the infinite regress problem (although he is\ncertainly aware of the issue, and we can make plausible guesses about\nwhy he thinks the objectionable infinite regresses do not\n arise).[47]\n But he has a clear (although not obviously successful) strategy for\nshowing that there cannot be many things each of which is\n\u201cfirst\u201d in the weak sense that it has nothing prior to it,\nand therefore nothing which is prior to everything other than itself.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not immediately draw this\nconclusion: rather, it is supposed to follow from a series of\ninferences he makes about what anything that is \u201cfirst\u201d\nmust be like.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s general strategy is (1) to argue that\nanything that is \u201cfirst\u201d must not have any kind of cause,\nsince any such cause would be prior to it and it would not be first,\nand that it has no privation or potentiality (either of which would\nimply dependence on something prior); then (2) to infer that since it\nhas no cause it must be simple, i.e., that it is\n\u201cone\u201d in the sense of not having any of the different\nkinds of internal composition (e.g., out of matter and form, genus and\ndifferentia, or physically extended parts); then (3) to infer from its\nsimplicity and non-dependence that it has no partner and no contrary,\ni.e., that it is \u201cone\u201d in the sense of being unique; (4)\nthen to infer from its negative attributes (especially its\nimmateriality) to its being\n intelligence[48]\n and to the kind of intelligence it is, and then to derive its other\npositive attributes from its being this kind of intelligence (or\nsimply to reduce the other attributes to its being this kind of\nintelligence); and finally (5) to infer from its simplicity to the\nonly possible way that it can generate something outside itself. Since\nwe know that there are things other than the First, and since anything\nother than the First must derive its being directly or indirectly from\nthe First, it will follow that the First does immediately generate at\nleast one thing, a \u201cSecond\u201d; and F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nwill try to sketch how the First either directly or indirectly causes\nall the main types of constituents of the world.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s transitions from the First\u2019s\nsimplicity to its uniqueness, from its negative attributes to its\nbeing intelligence, and from its intrinsic attributes to its producing\nsomething outside it, are all high-risk moments, and will all be\nchallenged by other Arabic thinkers.\n\nWe will concentrate here on the stages of argument up through the\nuniqueness of the First, with a few comments at the end on how\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee hopes to get to its being intelligence (and\nto what kind of intelligence it is) and to its generating a Second.\nSometimes F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee just states his conclusions without\nexplicit argument, and sometimes he suggests what premisses the\nconclusion is supposed to follow from, while leaving it to the reader\nto figure out how it is supposed to follow. It is usually not\ntoo hard to fill in a broadly plausible argument. But the obvious ways\nof doing this, not drawing on any technical Farabian metaphysical\nnotions, are often disappointingly vague. We may be able to get more\nprecise, using notions from the Book of Letters and On\nthe One which F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s terminology here\npoints back to.\n\nAt a first stab: F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee argues that, if something is\n\u201cfirst\u201d in the sense that nothing is prior to it, it\ncannot be dependent on anything for its existence or for its\ncontinuation in existence. Therefore it has existed without beginning\nand will exist without end, and has no potentiality for not existing.\nIt has no efficient cause, but also no material cause: if it had a\nmaterial cause, its matter would be prior to it, and presumably it\nwould also depend on an efficient cause to turn its matter into it. It\nis less obvious how F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee wants to infer that it is\nperfect, with no deficiency or privation, but perhaps the thought is\nthat if it were deprived of F, it would have to be of such a kind that\nit could be F, and therefore it (or its matter) would be\npotentially F. And F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee apparently thinks he can\nconclude, not just that a first being has no potentiality for not\nexisting, but that it has no potentiality for any predicate that it\ndoes not have by its\n essence:[49]\n perhaps his reason is that if it were potentially F, it would depend\non something else which is actually F to make it actually F, and this\nother thing would be prior to it. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also says\nthat a first being has no final cause, and while he\nofficially says here only that there is no final cause for its\nexistence, he also thinks that there is no final cause that\nit aims to achieve through its activities, again because it\nwould be in potentiality to some perfection that it does not have by\nits essence. It also has no form, because nothing can have a form\nunless it also has an underlying matter, which has already been\nexcluded. And F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee adds another argument, that\n\n\nif it had a form, its essence [dh\u00e2t] would be composed\nout of matter and form, and if it were so then its constitution\n[qiw\u00e2m] would be through its two parts out of which it\nis composed, and its existence [wuj\u00fbd] would have a\ncause. (Walzer 1985, 58,2\u20135\n\n\nThis allows him to generalize from the case of matter and form to\nother kinds of constituents: as he says when he comes back to this\nissue after the uniqueness arguments,\n\n\nit is not divisible in account [Arabic qawl = Greek\nlogos] into things by which it is\n substantified,[50]\n since it is impossible that each part of the account which explicates\nits meaning should signify a part of what it is substantified by. For\nif it were so, the parts by which it is substantified would be causes\nof its existence [wuj\u00fbd] in the way that the meanings\nwhich the parts of a thing\u2019s definition signify are causes of\nthe existence of the thing defined, and in the way that the matter and\nthe form are causes of the existence of what is composed out of them;\nand this is impossible for it, since it is first and its existence has\nno cause at all. And if it is not divisible by these divisions, it is\neven further from being divisible by divisions of quantity or the\nother ways of being divided. (Walzer 1985, 66,8\u201368,1)\n\n\nSo any kind of composition is incompatible with its being first, since\neach of its components would be prior to it and would be a (partial)\ncause of its existence; we could also argue that the components would\nneed a cause to unify them, and that this cause would cause the\nexistence of the composite.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives a series of arguments for the\nconclusions (central from a Muslim point of view) that a First can\nhave no partner and no contrary. He does not actually use the word\n\u201cpartner\u201d here, but uses phrases like \u201cnothing other\nthan it can have the existence [wuj\u00fbd] that it\nhas\u201d. While F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives a number of arguments\nfor these conclusions, we can reconstruct perhaps the central\narguments as follows. To conclude that, if X is first, no\nother being Y can have the same existence that X\nhas, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that, if this were so, X\nand Y would not differ, and so would be the same thing, not\ntwo things. But what justifies the claim that X and\nY would not differ? F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says,\n\n\nif there were a difference between them, then that by which they\ndiffer would be other than what they share, and the thing by which\neach of them differs from the other would be a part of that by which\ntheir existence is constituted, and what they share would be the other\npart: so each of them would be divided in account, and each of its\nparts would be a cause of the constitution of its essence, and so it\nwould not be first. (Walzer 1985, 58,13\u201360,3)\n\n\nAn obvious objection is that although X, being first, must be\nsimple, Y might not be: perhaps X is wholly\nconstituted by what X and Y share, but Y is\nonly partially constituted by this common element and is partially\nconstituted by something else. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee considers this\nobjection and replies that in that case\n\n\nthe existence of the latter is not the existence of the former, rather\nthe essence of the former is simple and indivisible and the essence of\nthe latter is divisible, and therefore the latter has two parts by\nwhich it is constituted, and therefore its existence has a cause, and\ntherefore its existence is inferior to the existence of the former and\ndeficient in comparison with it, and therefore it is not existence in\nthe first rank, (Walzer 1985, 60,9\u201313)\n\n\ncontrary to the hypothesis that Y has the same existence that\nX has.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives two arguments that, if X is\nfirst, it cannot have a contrary Y. Both arguments turn on a\ndefinition of \u201ccontrary\u201d: X and Y are\ncontrary if they cannot be together in the same place or substratum,\nso that X is present in some place or substratum through\nY\u2019s being absent from it, and X is absent from\na place or substratum through Y\u2019s being present in it.\nOn the basis of this definition, Far\u00e2b\u00ee argues, first,\nthat if the First, X, were contrary to Y, then\nX\u2019s being (in some place or substratum, or being at\nall) would be conditioned on Y\u2019s absence, and therefore\nX\u2019s substance would not be sufficient to explain\nX\u2019s continuing to exist, or X\u2019s existing\nat all: so, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says, X\u2019s\nconstitution [qiw\u00e2m] would not be in X\u2019s\nsubstance (alone), but would be through something else, and so\nX would not be first. Second, X and Y would\nhave to have something common that is receptive of both of them, so\nthat this common thing would persist in being and X and\nY would succeed each other in it, and so this common thing\nwould be prior to them and neither of them would be first. These\narguments are recognizably developments of Aristotle\u2019s arguments\nin Metaphysics XII against there being a pair of contrary\nfirst principles like Empedocles\u2019 Love and Strife, although\nAristotle relies on the premiss that the first principle is pure\nactuality, while F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee makes relatively little use\nof the notion of actuality and relies on the premisses that the first\nprinciple is simple and that it does not depend on anything else for\nits\n existence.[51]\n F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s conclusion that the First has no\ncontrary is not simply a special case of his conclusion that the First\nhas no partner, or as he says that \u201cnothing other than it can\nhave the existence [wuj\u00fbd] that it has\u201d, since he\ndoes not assume that contraries would have the same existence or would\nbe members of the same species or genus.\n\nBut it would be unfair to summarize F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\narguments by saying\n\n\nthe First must have nothing to be prior to it, therefore it must be\nsimple; so there cannot be two Firsts, since if there were they would\nhave something in common and something that distinguishes them, and so\nthey (or at least one of them) would not be simple.\n\n\nThis argument seems open to an immediate objection: why would they\nhave to have anything in common, except that they are both first, in\nthe sense that neither of them has anything prior to it? And being\n\u201cfirst\u201d in this sense is a mere negation\u2014indeed\nmerely the negation of a relation to something else\u2014and so\nfirstness would not be a constituent of the thing that is\nfirst, and so would not threaten its simplicity. And, while it is not\nclear that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee has an adequate reply to this\nobjection, his argument is more sophisticated than this quick summary\nwould suggest, and its extra sophistication may give him more\nresources to deal with objections, including the objection that\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee has not ruled out the possibility of infinite\nregresses and that there may be no First, or that there could be a\nFirst and also other things independent of the First if the chains of\ntheir causes go back ad infinitum without leading to a\nFirst.\n\nIt should be clear already that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\nargument in the Perfect City uses the word\n\u201cexistence\u201d [wuj\u00fbd] a great deal, in\ncontexts where it is not obviously necessary. Why say that \u201cthe\nfirst being is the first cause of existence to all other beings\u201d\nand not just \u201cthe first being is the cause of all other\nbeings\u201d? Why say \u201cnothing other than it can have the\nexistence that it has\u201d rather than \u201cnothing other than it\nis first\u201d or \u201cnothing other than it is in the same species\nor genus as it\u201d? Why say that if X and Y are\nsimilar in one respect and different in another respect,\n\n\nthe thing by which each of them differs from the other would be a part\nof that by which their existence is constituted, and what they share\nwould be the other part: so each of them would be divided in account,\nand each of its parts would be a cause of the constitution of its\nessence, and so it would not be first\n\n\nrather than \u201cthe thing by which each of them differs from the\nother would be a part of it, and what they share would be the other\npart, and then its parts would be prior to it, and so it would not be\nfirst\u201d?\n\nWhat does it mean, for F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, to say that\nX is the cause of existence to Y, or that X\nis the existence of Y, or that X enters into the\nconstitution [qiw\u00e2m] of Y or is part of that\nby which the existence of Y is constituted? At first blush,\nthe first sentence of the Perfect City, \u201cthe first\nbeing [mawj\u00fbd] is the first cause of existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] to all other beings\n[mawj\u00fbd\u00e2t]\u201d, seems to be taking the\nposition of al-Kind\u00ee that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee had\ncriticized in the Book of Letters, according to which the\nfirst being, God, would be a separately existing existence-itself,\nsuch that everything else would come to exist by participating in it:\nthings would exist [would be mawj\u00fbd] through an\nexistence [wuj\u00fbd] as they are white though a whiteness,\nand God would be that existence. Is he here, in the Perfect\nCity, slipping into the kind of popularizing philosophy that he\nhad criticized through a logical syntax of language in the Book of\nLetters? An immediate response is that\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s position in the Perfect City\nis not the same as Kind\u00ee\u2019s, since F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ndoes not say that God is the existence of anything else. But we would\nstill want to know how God is the cause of the existence of other\nthings, and more generally what it means to say that X is the\ncause of the existence of Y, and what role this plays in\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s argument in the Perfect\nCity. And F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s positive theory in the\nBook of Letters gives us resources for understanding\nthis.\n\nAs we saw in\n Section 3.4,\n on F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s analysis in the Book of\nLetters there are two main senses of being\n[mawj\u00fbd], with corresponding senses of existence\n[wuj\u00fbd]. If \u201cbeing\u201d [mawj\u00fbd]\nmeans \u201cbeing outside the mind as it is inside the mind\u201d,\nthen the subject of which is predicated is a thought in the mind (a\nconcept or judgment), and its existence [wuj\u00fbd] is its\nrelation to something extramental, and this existence holds univocally\nof all true thoughts. Clearly this cannot be what\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee means in the Perfect City\u2014it\nwould be pointless to ask, in this sense, whether something else has\nthe same existence [wuj\u00fbd] that the First has. On the\nother hand, if \u201cmawj\u00fbd\u201d means \u201cbeing\ncircumscribed by a quiddity outside the mind\u201d, then the subject\nof which it is predicated is a thing really existing outside the mind,\nand, according to Book of Letters I,89, its corresponding\nwuj\u00fbd is either its quiddity or part of its quiddity.\nInterpreting wuj\u00fbd as quiddity does not make sense of\nthe Perfect City\u2019s question whether anything else has\nthe same wuj\u00fbd as the First: it would be trivially true\nthat no two distinct things could have the same quiddity, or, if we\nsay that the quiddity of a thing is just its form without its matter,\nit would still be trivially true that no two distinct\nimmaterial things could have the same quiddity. But\n\u201cpart of a quiddity\u201d works, particularly if we reflect on\nwhat kind of part of the quiddity of X could be called the\nwuj\u00fbd of X, and why. As we saw in\n Section 3.4,\n F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in the Book of Letters, following\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics VII,17, analyzes\nX\u2019s existence [wuj\u00fbd = ousia in\nAristotle\u2019s Greek] as the cause of the fact that X\nexists, and, in order to search for this cause as a middle term, tries\nto reanalyze the existential judgment \u201cX exists\u201d\nas a predicative judgment, something like \u201cY is\nX\u201d where Y is the per se subject of\nX. If X is entirely simple, then \u201cX\nexists\u201d cannot be reanalyzed in this way, but in this case there\nis no cause of the fact that X exists, and X\u2019s\nexistence [wuj\u00fbd] is identical to X without\nremainder. In cases where X can be analyzed into a subject\nand a predicate, one meaning of \u201cX exists\u201d is\nthat there is a middle term explaining why the predicate belongs to\nthe subject: and this middle term (not the linguistic expression but\nthe reality it signifies) is one of the things that can be called\n\u201cthe existence [wuj\u00fbd] of X by which it\nis constituted\u201d or \u201cthe cause of existence to\nX\u201d or \u201ca part by which its existence [is\nconstituted]\u201d. In this sense the interposition of the earth\nbetween the sun and the moon is a partial existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] of eclipse, or a part of the quiddity of\neclipse which is a cause of existence to eclipse, or a cause of the\nconstitution of\n eclipse.[52]\n Since the First is entirely simple, its quiddity cannot be spelled\nout into a definition, and so the First\u2019s existence is identical\nto the First without remainder, and there is no way that two simple\nthings can share the same existence. But the First is a \u201ccause\nof existence\u201d to a Second, or is \u201cpart of that by which\nthe existence of the Second is constituted\u201d, and similar\nexpressions, if the First enters as a cause into the real causal\ndefinition of the Second, which it does, since (as we will see) the\nSecond is constituted by its act of cognizing the First. This makes\nsense of the different things F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says in the\nPerfect City about X being the cause of existence to\nY, or X being a part of the constitution\n[qiw\u00e2m] of Y, of X and Y\nsharing the same existence. It also helps to show what the extra\ncontent is to saying \u201cX is the cause of existence to\nY\u201d rather than just \u201cX is the cause of\nY\u201d, and helps to explain\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s ground for his assumption that there\nis a First, i.e., that there is not an infinite regress of causes of\nexistence: if X is the cause of Y, X counts\nas the cause of existence to Y only if X would be\nmentioned in a causal definition of Y, i.e., if it is\nessential to Y to be caused by X, so that a\nY not caused by X would not really be a Y.\nIf there were an infinite regress of causes of existence to\nX, it would follow that the causal definition of X\nwould be infinitely long, which F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee presumably\nregards as absurd, as does Aristotle in Metaphysics II,2.\nThere may well be an infinite regress of causes of\ncoming-to-be, e.g., the infinite chain of my ancestors, but\nbecause these are not causes of existence, which would enter\ninto the quiddity of the effect and so would be mentioned in its\nscientific definition, they do not lead to the absurdity of an\ninfinitely long definition.\n\nAs we saw in\n Section 3.4,\n Book of Letters I,92 sketches out a program for finding a\nchain of causes of existence, where each cause enters into the\nquiddity of its effect and has a stronger claim to the title of\n\u201cbeing\u201d [mawj\u00fbd]. A substance is a cause of\nexistence to the accidents proper to it, and enters into their\nquiddity, but then there will be a hierarchy of causes of existence\nwithin the category of substance itself, until we reach some first\nsubstance, \u201cwhether this is one or more than one\u201d, which\nhas a stronger claim to the title of \u201cbeing\u201d than all\nother substances, and a fortiori than accidents.\n\n\nAnd if something is discovered outside all these categories which is\nthe cause of the realization of the quiddity of the most fundamental\nthing in this category [i.e., the category of substance], then this is\nmore deserving to be called \u201cbeing\u201d\n[mawj\u00fbd] than the most perfect thing in this category,\nand this is the first cause of existence [wuj\u00fbd] to the\nmost perfect thing in this category, and this most perfect thing [sc.\nwithin the category of substance] is the cause in the quiddity of the\nother things in this category, and what is in this category is the\ncause in the quiddity of the other categories: thus the beings, where\nwhat is meant by \u201cbeing\u201d is what has a quiddity outside\nthe soul, are ordered by this order. (Book of Letters\n I,92)[53]\n\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in the Perfect City and\nPolitical Regime claims to have shown that there is indeed\nexactly one such first being, which enters as an essential cause into\nthe quiddities of other things. The claim is not that the First acts\non each quiddity, from \u201coutside\u201d the quiddity, to give\nthat quiddity actual existence, but rather that whatever\nimmediately depends on the First is essentially constituted\nby its act of cognizing the First, so that a full account of what the\nSecond is necessarily involves the First; and lower things are\nessentially constituted by their relations to these higher things, and\nso are essentially dependent on the First.\n\nThe Perfect City and Political Regime make\nparticularly striking use of F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\n\u201cgeneral\u201d metaphysical treatises, the Book of\nLetters and On the One, in their accounts of the senses\nin which the First is one. The Perfect City and\nPolitical Regime go through a list of attributes of God, and\ntry to show that (and in what sense) each of them belongs to the\nFirst, and from a Muslim point of view one of God\u2019s most\nimportant attributes is that he is one\u2014first in the\nsense that there is no other god, and then also in the sense that he\ncontains no internal multiplicity. The Perfect City marks\nseveral senses in which the First is \u201cone\u201d. It is one in\nthat no other being shares its species of existence (66,5\u20137),\nand it is one in that it is \u201cundivided\u201d or\n\u201cindivisible\u201d, into quantitative parts or any other kind\nof parts (68,2\u20136); but then, finally,\n\n\nif the First is indivisible in its substance then the existence by\nwhich it is circumscribed [yan\u1e25\u00e2zu] from\nexistences other than it cannot be other than [the existence] by which\nit exists [is mawj\u00fbd] in itself, and therefore it is\ncircumscribed from what is other than it through a unity which is its\nessence [i.e., through a unity which it is, not through a\nunity distinct from itself]. For one of the meanings of unity is the\nspecific existence [wuj\u00fbd\n kh\u00e2\u1e63\u1e63][54]\n by which each being is circumscribed from what is other than it: this\nis that by which every being is called one inasmuch as it exists [is\nmawj\u00fbd] in respect of the existence which specifies it,\nand this is the meaning of \u201cone\u201d which is coextensive with\nexistence. So the First is one in this way too, and is more deserving\nof the name and meaning of \u201cone\u201d than any one other than\nit.\n\n\nHere the Perfect City is relying on the conclusion of the\nBook of Letters that \u201ccircumscribed by its\nquiddity\u201d is one of the meanings of \u201cbeing\u201d and the\nconclusion of the On the One that \u201ccircumscribed by its\nquiddity\u201d is one of the meanings of \u201cone\u201d, and using\nthese conclusions to interpret Aristotle\u2019s claim in\nMetaphysics IV,2 that \u201cbeing\u201d and\n\u201cone\u201d are mutually entailing. Any being X has a\n\u201cspecific existence\u201d which \u201ccircumscribes it\u201d,\ni.e., distinguishes it from all other things, and it is one\nin the sense that it is uniquely specified by this existence. If\nX is a member of a species, then X\u2019s\n\u201cspecific existence\u201d might include the matter or the place\nor other accidental attributes which distinguish X from other\nmembers of the same species. But, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is saying,\nif X is the First and therefore indivisible in its substance,\nit cannot have both a quiddity which it shares with other things and\nthen a distinct \u201cspecific existence\u201d which distinguishes\nit from those other things. So because it is one both as\n\u201cunique\u201d and as \u201cindivisible\u201d, its unity, that\nby which it is one, is completely identical with the quiddity by which\nit exists [is a being]. Here, as with the other attributes which he\ndemonstrates of the First, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is paralleling the\nMu\u02bftazilite pattern of asserting that, for any attribute F such\nthat we can say that God is F, the F-ness through which God is F is\nidentical with the divine essence. But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee claims\nto have based his account of the First and its attributes on\ndemonstrations grounded in analyses of the meanings of being, unity,\nintelligence and the other fundamental philosophical concepts;\nwhereas, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee would say, when the\nMu\u02bftazilites say that God is F through an F-ness which is\nidentical with his essence, and therefore is F in a different way from\ncreatures, this is bare assertion to save their theses that God is\nsimple and that he is nonetheless F, and does not rest on an analysis\nof a special sense of F that applies to God and how it relates to more\nordinary senses of F. In the cases of being and unity, the special\nmetaphysics of the Perfect City and Political Regime\nis supposed to rest on the general metaphysics of the Book of\nLetters and On the One, and is supposed to vindicate\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s claim that Aristotelian general\nmetaphysics, when properly understood, will give the path to a\nscientific special metaphysics.\n\nWe conclude by briefly sketching two further, and problematic, key\nsteps in the metaphysical section of the Perfect City and\nPolitical Regime, namely F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\nargument that the First is both intelligence [\u02bfaql =\nGreek nous] and intelligible [ma\u02bfq\u00fbl =\nno\u00eaton], and his argument that the First is a cause of\nexistence to other things, and immediately to a single Second, the\nimmaterial intelligence which moves the outermost sphere (in the\nPerfect City), or to a small finite number of Seconds, the\nimmaterial intelligences which move the different heavenly spheres (in\nthe Political Regime). By arguing that the First is\nintelligence and intelligible, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee tries to\nderive versions of the attributes of knowledge and truth standardly\nascribed to God, and by arguing that it produces a Second he tries to\nderive a version of the act of creation standardly ascribed to God.\nBut he is deriving radically stripped-down versions of these\nattributes and acts, since the First directly knows only itself, and\ndirectly creates only the Second (or a few Seconds), even if it may be\nsaid as a consequence to indirectly know and create other things\ntoo.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s basic steps in arguing that the First\nis intelligence and intelligible are the premisses that\n\n\nwhat prevents the form from being intelligence and from actually\nintellectually cognizing is the matter in which the thing exists\n\n\nand that\n\n\nwhat prevents the thing from being intelligible in actuality [or\n\u201cfrom being intellectually cognized in actuality\u201d] and\nfrom being by its substance intelligible [or \u201cintellectually\ncognized\u201d] is also matter. (Walzer 1985, 70)\n\n\nSince the First has no matter, it would follow that it is actually\nintelligence and actually intellectually cognized.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s first premiss, that anything would be\nintellectually cognizing if it did not have a matter blocking it,\ninitially seems strange and ill-motivated. But\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee would see the second premiss, that matter is\nthe obstacle to something\u2019s being intellectually cognized, as\ngrounded in an Aristotelian analysis of intellectual cognition: the\nmind intellectually cognizes the form of a material thing precisely by\nabstracting it from its matter, and if the object had no matter to\nbegin with, then there is nothing further to do to it and it is\nalready intellectually\n cognized.[55]\n And F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee apparently sees the first premiss as\nfollowing from the second: if X is intrinsically without\nmatter, it is actually intellectually cognized intrinsically,\nand not through a relation to something else which would cognize it:\nand this can only because it actually intellectually cognizes\nitself, and does so intrinsically or essentially, not in\ndependence on some other\n cause.[56]\n Following this Aristotelian analysis, the First\u2019s act of\nintellectually cognizing its object would not be an accident\nof the First, but would be its essence; put the other way around, the\nFirst would be an intelligence, not by being a power for\nintellectually cognizing various objects, but by being an act\nof cognizing its object, namely the First itself. So, as\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says,\n\n\nthat it is intelligence [or \u201cintellectual cognition\u201d] and\nthat it is intellectually cognized and that it is intellectually\ncognizing are all a single essence and a single undivided substance.\n(Walzer 1985,\n 70)[57]\n\n\nOr, as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says in switching from the\nAristotelian language of \u201cintelligence\u201d to the\nQur\u02be\u00e2nic and kal\u00e2m language of God\u2019s\nattribute of knowledge, the First\u2019s knowledge does not require\nanything other than itself for it to know, and its knowledge is\nidentical with its essence (Walzer 1985, 72). This sounds like the\nMu\u02bftazilites in claiming to reconcile God\u2019s knowledge with\nhis simplicity. But while the Mu\u02bftazilites try to show how\nGod\u2019s knowledge can be simple and eternal despite God\u2019s\nknowing a vast plurality of things, some of which change,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee short-circuits the problem by saying that\nGod\u2019s knowledge is just knowledge of himself. Perhaps\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee would say that the problem just cannot be\nsolved if we assume that God is omniscient. Or perhaps he would say,\nwith Themistius (followed by many medieval philosophers), that God in\nknowing himself also implicitly knows other things because he is a\ncause of those other things.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also applies his groundwork from the Book\nof Letters to save the Qur\u02be\u00e2nic attribute that God is\n\u201ctrue\u201d or \u201ctruth\u201d [al-\u1e25aqq].\nThe First is \u201ctruth\u201d [\u1e25aq\u00eeqa] in the\nsense in which the \u1e25aq\u00eeqa of X is the\nquiddity of X, i.e., the existence [wuj\u00fbd]\nwhich specifies X as distinct from all other things, which\nmight be expressed by the definition or the ultimate differentia of\nX; and, as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee has already argued, there\nis no distinction between the First itself and the existence by which\nthe First is distinguished from other things. Also, if S\nthinks X in a way that corresponds to the way X is\nin itself, S\u2019s thought of X can be called\n\u201ctrue\u201d [\u1e25aqq], and X can also be\ncalled true insofar as it corresponds to S\u2019s thought of\nX. Since the First knows itself, it can be called\n\u201ctrue\u201d in this sense through itself, apart from any\nrelation to anything outside itself; and because this is essential to\nit, the \u201ctruth\u201d [\u1e25aq\u00eeqa] through\nwhich it is \u201ctrue\u201d in this sense is not anything other\nthan itself (Walzer 1985, 74). For the First to be \u201ctruth\u201d\nin this second sense seems to be equivalent to its being essentially\nintellectually cognized.\n\nIn passing from the First as intelligence to the First as causing\nbeing, F\u00e2r\u00e2bi is passing, in kal\u00e2m terms,\nfrom God\u2019s attributes to God\u2019s acts. His account of the\nFirst as intelligence was perhaps less concerned to show that God has\nknowledge, more concerned to show that God\u2019s knowledge is\nidentical with his essence, and to show in consequence the differences\nbetween the way that God knows and the ways that other things know.\nHis account of the First as causing being to other things, or (in\nkal\u00e2m terms) of God\u2019s act of creation, does not\nattempt to deduce, starting from what we have shown about the First,\nthat it must create other things rather than remaining in isolation.\nHe does say that\n\n\nwhen the First exists with the existence which it has, it necessarily\nfollows that there exist from it all the other beings whose existence\nis not by human will and choice, with the existences which they have,\n(Walzer 1985, 88,11\u201314)\n\n\nbut he gives no argument that the First\u2019s existence entails the\nexistence of other things. Rather, he seems to rely on the argument\nthat since other things in fact exist, their existence must ultimately\nbe caused by the First; his main concern is not to show that\nthe First causes the existence of other things, but to show\nhow it causes the existence of other things, and in\nparticular to show that that by which the First causes the existence\nof other things is identical with its essence, just as that by which\nthe First knows is identical with its\n essence.[58]\n As F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says, \u201cit is not divided into two\nthings, such that the substantiation of its essence is by one of them\nand something else\u2019s arising from it is by the other\u201d\n(Walzer 1985, 92,3\u20135): as he says a bit further down, the First\ndoes not require an accident or a motion in itself in order for\nsomething else to arise from it. (Nor is it affected or moved\nby something else\u2019s arising from it, since it cannot be\naffected or moved at all.) Nor, more generally, does the First require\nanything other than its essence\u2014whether an accident or\nmotion that would inhere in the First itself, or an external\ninstrument or material substrate that the First would cooperate with\nin producing some effect\u2014in order for something other than\nitself to arise from it. The First does cooperate with external\ninstruments and material substrata in producing some of its\neffects, and this is important for F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in\nexplaining how it can produce a plurality of effects, and how it can\nproduce more and less perfect effects, and how it can produce effects\nwhich are connected or \u201cordered\u201d rather than independent\nof each other. But the First must be able to produce at least some\nfirst effect without an instrument or substratum, or it would not be\nable to produce anything at all, and in that first case the existence\nof the First must be a sufficient cause of the existence of its\neffect.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives no further explanation of how or why\nthe existence of X can be a sufficient cause of the existence\nof Y. (He says that the existence of Y\n\u201cemanates\u201d [using the root f-y-\u1e0d] from the\nexistence of X, but this is just a technical term meaning\nthat X\u2019s existence, rather than some further act of\nX, causes Y to exist; the term\n\u201cemanation\u201d does not explain how this happens,\nand F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not pretend that it does.) He just\ninfers that this must happen in some cases, since more than one thing\nexists. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s situation is analogous to\nAristotle\u2019s in Metaphysics XII. After Aristotle has\nargued that the existence of motion presupposes a first cause which is\nessentially pure actuality, and which therefore cannot be changed or\nmoved, he faces the problem of explaining how such a cause can move\nsomething else. Aristotle answers that while an eternally unchanging\ncause cannot, by itself, cause changing motions, it can cause an\neternally constant motion (such as the eternal rotation of a heavenly\nsphere around its axis) if it causes it as a final cause, as\nan object desired by the object in motion. This leaves many\npuzzles\u2014why should this desire lead a heavenly sphere to move in\ncircles, how will that help it attain the desired object\u2014but\nAristotle can say that since every other kind of causality is\nimpossible, this is what must be happening even if we don\u2019t\nunderstand the details. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee faces a similar\ndifficulty in explanation, but he finds Aristotle\u2019s solution\nunsatisfying, not so much because these details are missing, as\nbecause it does not explain why the heavenly spheres, or their\nincorporeal movers other than the First exist\u2014at best, Aristotle\nassumes that the incorporeal substances and the spheres exist, and\nexplains why the spheres move. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, by contrast,\nhas undertaken to understand the First as a cause of\nexistence; and final causality, even if it is sufficient to\nexplain the motion of an already existent substance, does not seem\nsufficient to explain the existence of substances other than the\nFirst, either the heavenly spheres or their incorporeal movers. The\nFirst must cause existence before it can cause motion, and in fact\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not make it a mover at all, but rather\nsays that it is responsible for the existence of something which is in\nturn the first cause of motion. And if the First causes existence at\nall, it must first cause the existence of at least one thing simply by\nits own existence, not cooperating with any further attribute or\nmotion or instrument or matter. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not and\ncannot say anything about what the First does to cause the\nexistence of something else (he does not say that it causes the\nexistence of something else by thinking that thing, or even that it\ncauses the existence of something else as a byproduct of thinking\nitself); rather, he tries to describe how, and in what order, other\nthings are essentially dependent on the First.\n\nIn the Perfect City F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that the\nFirst causes existence, immediately and without cooperation with an\ninstrument or matter, only to a single thing, the Second; in the\nPolitical Regime, apparently, the First causes existence\nimmediately to several things, the Seconds. But in both treatises,\nwhen he introduces his discussion of the First as the cause of\nexistence to other things, he does not start by singling out a Second\nor Seconds. Rather, he starts by saying that \u201cthe substance of\n[the First] is a substance from which every existence emanates,\nwhatever this existence may be like, whether it is perfect or\ndeficient\u201d; (Walzer 1985,\n 94),[59]\n but he then immediately adds that \u201cwhen all the beings arise\nfrom it, they are ordered in their ranks, and each being receives from\nit the portion of existence which is due to it and the rank which is\ndue to it\u201d\n (ibid.).[60]\n But then there is a problem why the First\u2019s single simple\nexistence, assuming that it causes the existence of something else,\nshould cause a plurality of beings receiving greater or lesser\n\u201cportions\u201d of existence from it.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s answer to this problem seems to be\nless developed in the Political Regime than in the\nPerfect City. In the Political Regime, he says that\nthe Seconds (the intelligences that move the heavenly bodies), and\napparently also the \u201cactive intelligence\u201d that governs the\nsublunar world, \u201chave all received existence from the\nFirst\u201d (Butterworth 2015, 46, #34, translation modified); other\nthings depend on the Seconds or the active intelligence for their\nexistence, and for this reason receive lesser portions of existence.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says here that the Seconds, like the First,\nare such that their specific existence is sufficient for the existence\nof something else to emanate from them (ibid.): each Second produces a\nheavenly sphere composed of body and soul (it produces not merely the\nmotion but the existence of the sphere), and\nsublunar substances depend for their existence both on the heavenly\nspheres and on the active\n intelligence.[61]\n The Political Regime says that the Seconds have different\nranks (Butterworth 2015, 46, #34) but it does not say anything to\nexplain why there should be many of them or why they should differ in\nrank. In particular, it does not say that lower Seconds depend on\nhigher Seconds for their existence: each Second is described only as\nproducing a heavenly sphere, not as producing another Second, and as\nfar as we can tell each Second is produced immediately by the First\nwithout cooperation with any other cause. However, in the Perfect\nCity, F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that the First, immediately\nand by itself alone, produces only a single Second (Walzer 1985, 100),\nand that all other beings are produced by the First in conjunction\nwith instruments or material substrata, where these must be either the\nSecond or things which are produced by the First in conjunction with\nthe Second. This allows F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee to explain why there\nshould be a plurality of separate immaterial substances, and why they\nshould differ in rank: the Second which is immediately produced by the\nFirst has a greater \u201cportion of existence\u201d than the Third\nwhich depends essentially on the Second, and so on, and all of these\nseparate intelligences (the movers of the heavenly spheres and then\nthe active intelligence that governs the sublunar world) have greater\nportions of existence than sublunar substances which essentially\ndepend on the heavenly spheres and on the active intelligence. Here\nF\u00e2r\u00e2bi is following out the program of Book of\nLetters I,92, discussed above, of finding a single first\nsubstance (here the Second, i.e., the mover of the outermost heavenly\nsphere) on which all other substances are essentially dependent, and\nthen tracing it back in turn to a single simple First: the causal\ndefinition of any other substance, if made fully explicit, would have\nto refer to the motion of the outermost sphere and to the Second as\nits cause, and thus ultimately to the First. But\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee has the problem of explaining how a single\nSecond can be responsible for causing all this multiplicity of\nessentially differing beings. The Perfect City, like the\nPolitical Regime, stresses that the Seconds (or Second,\nThird, and so on), like the First, are each an intelligence which is\nessentially actually cognizing and is itself the object it cognizes,\nand whose specific existence is sufficient for the existence of\nsomething else to emanate from it; both treatises also stress that\nthese intelligences are also inferior to the First, notably in that\nthey do not have their full perfection purely in themselves, but only\nthrough a relation to the First, namely through intellectually\ncognizing the First. But if each of these intelligences, like the\nFirst, immediately produces only a single being like itself, they will\nnot be able to explain the multiplicity and complexity of the beings\nthat arise indirectly from the First. In the Political Regime\napparently each of the Seconds produces just a single being, namely\nthe heavenly sphere it governs (although this sphere has some\ncomplexity as a compound of body and soul, and although the active\nintelligence that governs the sublunar world has more complex\neffects), but in the Perfect City each of these intelligences\nhas to produce two beings, namely the heavenly sphere it\ngoverns and the next\n intelligence.[62]\n Thus\n\n\nfrom the First emanates the existence of the Second, and this Second\ntoo is a substance which is not embodied at all and is not in matter,\nand it intellectually cognizes itself [or \u201cits essence\u201d]\nand it intellectually cognizes the First, and its intellectual\ncognition of itself is not something other than its essence; and by\nits intellectually cognizing the First there follows necessarily from\nit the existence of a Third, and by its being substantified by the\nessence which is specific to it there follows necessarily from it the\nexistence of the first heaven. (Walzer 1985, 100)\n\n\nSo for the Perfect City, as in the Political Regime,\nthe Second, like the First, essentially cognizes itself, and there is\nno distinction between its act of cognizing itself, the existence by\nwhich it is substantially constituted, and that through which it gives\nrise to the existence of the heavenly sphere it governs. But the\nPerfect City can say that there is a distinction between this\nintelligence\u2019s cognition of itself, which is essential\nto it, and its cognition of the First, through which it\nattains a perfection, by relation to something else, exceeding what it\nhas just by itself. Or perhaps it would be better to say that its\nessence includes a relation to the First, and that its essence is\ntherefore compound, in something like the way that a species-essence\ncomposed of genus and differentia is compound.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does not want to say that an immaterial\nintelligence is composed of two beings\n[mawj\u00fbd\u00e2t], such as substance and accident or\nmatter and form, but he wants to say that it has two\nexistences [wuj\u00fbd\u00e2t], that it\nis in two ways or in a compound way. His wager in the\nPerfect City is that he can explain this plurality of\nexistences in immaterial substances by the way in which they are\ncaused by the First, and that this plurality of existences will in\nturn explain how these immaterial substances can give rise to the many\ncomplex beings ultimately arise from the First.\n",
