    "main_text": "The Doctrine of Suspension\n9. The Doctrine of Suspension\nHaving argued that uneasiness, rather than perception of the\ngreater good, is what determines the will, Locke turns to the question\nof which of all the uneasinesses that beset us \u201chas the\nprecedency in determining the will to the next\naction\u201d. His answer:\nthat ordinarily, which is the most pressing of\nthose [uneasinesses], that are judged capable of being then\nremoved. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.40: 257)\nLocke therefore assumes that uneasinesses can be ranked in order of\nintensity or strength, and that among all the uneasinesses importuning\nan agent, the one that ordinarily determines her will is the one that\nexerts the greatest pressure on her mind.  The picture with which\nLocke appears to be working is of a mind that is the playground of\nvarious forces of varying strengths exerting different degrees of\ninfluence on the will, where the will is determined by the strongest\nof those forces.\nNotice, however, Locke\u2019s use of the word\n\u201cordinarily\u201d. Sometimes, as Locke emphasizes, the will\nis not determined by the most pressing uneasiness:\nFor the mind having in most cases, as is\nevident in Experience, a power to suspend the execution and\nsatisfaction of any of its desires, and so all, one after another, is\nat liberty to consider the objects of them; examine them on all sides,\nand weigh them with others. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.47: 263)\nThis is the doctrine of suspension. On this view, we agents have\nthe \u201cpower to suspend any particular desire, and keep it from\ndetermining the will, and engaging us in action\u201d (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.50: 266). As Locke makes clear, this power to prevent the\nwill\u2019s determination, that is, this power to avoid willing, is\nabsent when the action proposed is to be done presently and involves\nthe continuation or stopping of a process in which one is currently\nengaged (see Section 6 above). But when it\ncomes to \u201cchusing a remote [i.e., future] Good as an end to be\npursued\u201d, agents are \u201cat Liberty in respect\nof willing\u201d (E5 II.xxi.56:\n270).[7]\nSome commentators (e.g., Chappell 1994: 118) think that, at least\nin E5, Locke comes to see that the doctrine of suspension conflicts\nwith his answer to the question of whether we are free to will what we\nwill (raised in II.xxi.25). This is because they take Locke\u2019s\nanswer to the latter question to be negative, and take the doctrine of\nsuspension to entail a positive answer to the same question, at least\nwith respect to some actions. But there are good reasons to think that\nthere is no inconsistency here: for Locke\u2019s answer to the\nII.xxi.25 question is arguably in the affirmative\n(see Section 7\nabove).[8]\nCommentators also wonder whether the doctrine of suspension\nintroduces an account of freedom that differs from Locke\u2019s\nofficial account, both in E1 and in E2\u20135. The problem is that Locke\nsays that \u201cin [the power to suspend the prosecution of\none\u2019s desires] lies the liberty Man has\u201d, that the power\nto suspend is \u201cthe source of all liberty\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.47:\n263), that it is \u201cthe hinge on which turns the liberty\nof intellectual Beings\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.52: 266), and that it is\n\u201cthe great inlet, and exercise of all the liberty Men\nhave, are capable of, or can be useful to them\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.52:\n267). These passages suggest that Locke takes freedom to be\n(something intimately related to) the power to suspend our desires, a\npower that cannot simply be identified with the two-way power\nthat Locke identifies with freedom of action at II.xxi.8 ff. (see\nYaffe 2000: 12\u201374).\nBut there is a simple interpretation of these passages that does\nnot require us to read Locke as offering a different account of\nfreedom as the ability to suspend. The power to suspend is the power\nto keep one\u2019s will from being determined, that is, the power to\nforbear willing to do A if one wills to forbear willing to\ndo A. This is just one part of the freedom to will to\ndo A, according to Locke\u2019s definition of freedom of\naction applied to the action of willing to do A. (The other\npart is the power to will to do A if one wills to will to\ndo A.) Thus if, as Locke seems to argue in II.xxi.23\u201324,\nwe are (except under very unusual circumstances) free with respect to\nthe act of willing with respect to a future course of action, then it\nfollows immediately that we have the power to suspend. Locke\u2019s\nclaims about the power to suspend being the source of all liberty and\nthe hinge on which liberty turns can be understood as claims that the\npower to suspend is a particularly important aspect of freedom of\naction as applied to the action of willing. What makes it important is\nthe fact that it is the misuse of this freedom that accounts for our\nresponsibility for actions that conduce to our own unhappiness or\nmisery.\nHow so? Locke claims that the power of suspension was given to us\n(by God) for a reason, so that we might \u201cexamine, view, and\njudge, of the good or evil of what we are going to do\u201d (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.47: 263) in order to discover\nwhether that particular thing, which is then proposed,\nor desired, lie in the way to [our] main end, and make a real part of\nthat which is [our] greatest good. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.52:\n267)\nWhen we make the kinds of mistakes for which we deserve punishment,\nsuch as falling into gluttony or envy or selfishness, it is not\nbecause we have, after deliberation and investigation, perhaps through\nno fault of our own, acquired a mistaken view of the facts; it is\nbecause we engage in \u201ca too hasty compliance with our\ndesires\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.53: 268) and fail to \u201chinder blind\nPrecipitancy\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.67: 279).  What matters is not that\nwe have failed to will the forbearing to will to go to the movies or\nclean the fridge. What matters is that we have failed to will the\nforbearing to prosecute our most pressing desires, allowing ourselves\nto be guided by uneasinesses that might, for all we know, lead us to\nevil. If we have the power to suspend the prosecution of our desires\n(including our most pressing desire), then we misuse it when we do not\nexercise it (or when we fail to exercise it when its exercise is\ncalled for). So, not only is Locke\u2019s doctrine of suspension\nconsistent with his account of the freedom to will, it also provides\npart of the answer to Molyneux\u2019s worry:\nAnd here we may see how it comes to pass, that\na Man may justly incur punishment\u2026: Because, by a too hasty\nchoice of his own making, he has imposed on himself wrong measures of\ngood and evil\u2026He has vitiated his own Palate, and must be\nanswerable to himself for the sickness and death that follows from\nit.
