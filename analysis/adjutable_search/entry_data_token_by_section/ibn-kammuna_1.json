    "main_text": "Writings\n2. Writings\n\n\nThe latest studies on Ibn Kammuna have focused mainly on his\npsychology; his writings and doctrines in that field will be discussed\nbelow. Judging in terms of its impact on modern scholarship,\nespecially when one moves beyond the rather narrow confines of\nspecialists in late medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy, as well\nits impact upon his own personal life, Ibn Kammuna\u2019s Tanq\u012bh\u0323\n(Examination of the Three Faiths, English translation by\nPerlmann) is his most important work. The fundamental premise of the\ntreatise, and one that informs other of his writings as well, is that\nthere is a single theory of prophecy that is accepted by Jews,\nChristians, and Muslims alike, and which, moreover, meets the truth\nstandards of philosophy. What remains, then, is to compare the claims\nthat are particular to each of the three faiths. Though\nthe Examination should not be classified as a polemical work,\nas it contains no outright attack on any faith, its pro-Jewish bias is\nquite evident. Ibn Kammuna constructed the Jewish view he presents by\nmeans of a combination of ideas drawn from Maimonides and Judah\nHallevi. While this seems at first to be an odd mismatch of\nauthorities, Ibn Kammuna was not the only Jewish thinker to harmonize\nthe two eminent Andalusians. Christians and Muslims rejected the way\ntheir tenets were presented, and representatives of both penned\nrebuttals (Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 106\u2013113). On the other\nhand, no Jewish reaction of any sort to the Examination has\nreached us. It should be added that neither in the\nExamination, nor in any other work, does Ibn Kammuna make any\nunambiguous reference to Buddhism; given the political realities of\nMongol rule (the Mongols had not yet converted to Islam) as well as\nIbn Kammuna\u2019s broad interests, one might have expected him to exhibit\nsome curiosity.\n\n\nIbn Kammuna wrote a much shorter treatise on the differences between\nthe two main Jewish groupings, Rabbinites and Karaites (English\ntranslation by Nemoy). Here again, despite the absence of any open\npolemics, it is clear that Ibn Kammuna\u2019s sympathies lie with the\nRabbinic majority.\n\n\nIbn Kammuna\u2019s most significant contribution to the history of\nphilosophy is his detailed commentary to Suhraward\u012b\u2019s\nal-Talw\u012bh\u0323\u0101t.  (Several editions have appeared and are\ndiscussed in the last section of this entry). This is the first known\ncommentary to that work, which, though more Aristotelian than other\nwritings of Suhraward\u012b, still conveys essential points of the Ishraqi\nphilosophy. Directly through his commentary, and indirectly by means\nof his influence upon Qut\u0323b al-D\u012bn al-Shiraz\u012b (1236\u20131311), Ibn Kammuna\nwas very instrumental in the initial phases of the exposition and\ndiffusion of Suhraward\u012b\u2019s thought.\n\nAl-Jad\u012bd f\u012b \u2018l-h\u0323ikma (The New Wisdom); is a\ncomprehensive exposition of thirteenth century science and\nphilosophy. (For a preliminary study, see Langemann 2005; the titles\nof this book are discussed in the final sections below.)  Numerous\nmanuscript copies exist (Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 87\u201392). Ibn\nKammuna experimented with different formats and especially different\nlengths in his philosophical writing. He adhered to the traditional\ntri-partite classification of logic, physics, and metaphysics, in a\nlengthy format (al-Jad\u012bd), a highly condensed version\n(Talkh\u012bs\u0323; see Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 94, for\nbibliography, and an edition of the Arabic text, 196\u2013206), and quite\nlikely a middle length version (Risala f\u012b \u2018l-h\u0323ikma),\nwhose authenticity is still unresolved (Langermann 2005, 279\u2013286).\n\n\nSimilarly, he has left us a medium length pietistic work (Kalimat\nwajiza) and a much shorter version of the same treatise\n(Ithb\u0101t al-mabda\u02be); but he also confides that he may expand\nupon the Kalim\u0101t waj\u012bza (Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006,\n140). Even if that plan never came to fruition (no evidence of this\nlonger version has as yet turned up), it indicates his conviction that\nimportant topics ought to be discussed in all three formats, which\npresumably take into consideration the varying abilities of people to\ndevote time to study. The two extant pietistic texts are published\n(with no discussion of the contents) by Pourjavady & Schmidtke\n2006, 139\u2013195. Langermann (2017) has published an annotated\ntranslation of the Ithb\u0101t. These are discussed further below,\nin the penultimate section.\n\n\nIbn Kamm\u016bna wrote glosses to an important work of Islamic theology,\nFakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s al-Ma\u2018\u0101lim (Schmidtke & Pourjavady\n2007). In part this is a supercommentary, that is, a response to an\nearlier set of glosses prepared by his contemporary, Najm al-Din\nal-Katibi al-Qazwini (d. 1277). In some places Ibn Kamm\u016bna defends\nal-Razi against the strictures of al-Katib\u012b al-Qazwin\u012b, but in others\nraises criticisms of his own against al-R\u0101z\u012b. Some of the latter\nbetray upon close reading a subtle anti-Islamic polemic. For example,\nhis long gloss on the first query in chapter seven (Schmidtke &\nPourjavady 2007, 96\u201398) is a critique of the role of miracles in\nestablishing the prophetic mission. Ibn Kamm\u016bna names no prophets,\nconcentrating instead on the precise definition of mu\u2018jiza (the Arabic\nterm for miracle) given by al-R\u0101z\u012b himself in other writings, which\ncontradicts his definition in this particular work; and further\narguing, again on theoretical grounds, that a tradition can be false\n(or at least contain some falsity) even if the transmitters are\nmany. However, in the query under scrutiny, al-R\u0101z\u012b is speaking\nspecifically about Muhammad. Thus Ibn Kamm\u016bna\u2019s critiques amount in\neffect to a rejection of the proofs for Muhammad\u2019s prophetic\nmission. Later on, though, Ibn Kammuna makes specific criticisms of\nJudaism and Christianity (Schmidtke & Pourjavady 2007, 226). The\nglosses are written in a the highly technical language of Islamic\ntheology, which is very different from the philosophical diction he\nuses in other writings. Ibn Kamm\u016bna has clearly mastered both\nidioms. \n \n\nSeveral paradoxes are associated with Ibn Kamm\u016bna, and these continue\nto exercise Iranian thinkers down to the present. These are discussed\nin the final section of this entry.  He has also left us some minor\nwritings and correspondence; some pieces of a medical writings have\nalso been recovered (see Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006 for\nbibliography; medical fragments published, translated, and analyzed in\nLangermann 2007, 14\u201319).\n",
