Introduction: time travel vs. time machine\n\n\nThe topic of time machines is the subject of a sizable and growing \nphysics literature, some of which has filtered down to popular and \nsemi-popular \n presentations.[1]\n The issues raised by this topic are largely oblique, if not \northogonal, to those treated in the philosophical literature on time \n travel.[2]\n Most significantly, the so-called paradoxes of time travel do not \nplay a substantial role in the physics literature on time machines. \nThis literature equates the possibility of time travel with the \nexistence of closed timelike curves (CTCs) or worldlines for material\nparticles that are smooth, future-directed timelike curves with \n self-intersections.[3]\n Since time machines designate devices which bring about the existence\nof CTCs and thus enable time travel, the paradoxes of time travel are\nirrelevant for attempted \u201cno-go\u201d results for time \nmachines because these results concern what happens before the \nemergence of \n CTCs.[4]\n This, in our opinion, is fortunate since the paradoxes of time travel\nare nothing more than a crude way of bringing out the fact that the \napplication of familiar local laws of relativistic physics to a \nspacetime background which contains CTCs typically requires that \nconsistency constraints on initial data must be met in order for a \nlocal solution of the laws to be extendable to a global solution. The\nnature and status of these constraints is the subject of ongoing \ndiscussion. We will not try to advance the discussion of this issue \n here;[5]\n rather, our aim is to acquaint the reader with the issues addressed \nin the physics literature on time machines and to connect them with \nissues in the philosophy of space and time and, more generally, with \nissues in the foundations of physics.\n\n\nParadox mongers can be reassured in that if a paradox is lost in \nshifting the focus from time travel itself to time machines, then a \nparadox is also gained: if it is possible to operate a time machine \ndevice that produces CTCs, then it is possible to alter the structure\nof spacetime such that determinism fails; but by undercutting \ndeterminism, the time machine undercuts the claim that it is \nresponsible for producing CTCs. But just as the grandfather paradox \nis a crude way of making a point, so this new paradox is a crude way \nof indicating that it is going to be difficult to specify what it \nmeans to be a time machine. This is a task that calls not for paradox\nmongering but for scientifically informed philosophizing. The present\narticle will provide the initial steps of this task and will indicate\nwhat remains to be done. But aside from paradoxes, the main payoff of\nthe topic of time machines is that it provides a quick route to the \nheart of a number of foundations problems in classical general \nrelativity theory and in attempts to produce a quantum theory of \ngravity by combining general relativity and quantum mechanics. We \nwill indicate the shape of some of these problems here, but will \nrefer the interested reader elsewhere for technical details.\n\n\nThere are at least two distinct general notions of time machines, \nwhich we will call Wellsian and Thornian for short.\nIn The Time Machine, H. G. Wells (1931) described what has \nbecome science fiction\u2019s paradigmatic conception of a time machine: \nthe intrepid operator fastens her seat belt, dials the target \ndate\u2014past or future\u2014into the counter, throws a lever, and\nsits back while time rewinds or fast forwards until the target date \nis reached. We will not broach the issue of whether or not a Wellsian\ntime machine can be implemented within a relativistic spacetime \nframework. For, as will soon become clear, the time machines which \nhave recently come into prominence in the physics literature are of \nan utterly different kind. This second kind of time machine was \noriginally proposed by Kip Thorne and his collaborators (see Morris \nand Thorne 1988; Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever 1988). These articles \nconsidered the possibility that, without violating the laws of \ngeneral relativistic physics, an advanced civilization might \nmanipulate concentrations of matter-energy so as to produce CTCs \nwhere none would have existed otherwise. In their example, the \nproduction of \u201cwormholes\u201d was used to generate the \nrequired spacetime structure. But this is only one of the ways in \nwhich a time machine might operate, and in what follows any device \nwhich affects the spacetime structure in such a way that CTCs result \nwill be dubbed a Thornian time machine. We will only be \nconcerned with this variety of time machine, leaving the Wellsian \nvariety to science fiction writers. This will disappoint the \naficionados of science fiction since Thornian time machines do not \nhave the magical ability to transport the would-be time traveler to \nthe past of the events that constitute the operation of the time \nmachine. For those more interested in science than in science \nfiction, this loss is balanced by the gain in realism and the \nconnection to contemporary research in physics.\n\n\nIn Sections 2 and 3 we investigate the circumstances under which it \nis plausible to see a Thornian time machine at work. The main \ndifficulty lies in specifying the conditions needed to make sense of \nthe notion that the time machine \u201cproduces\u201d or is \n\u201cresponsible for\u201d the appearances of CTCs. We argue that \nat present there is no satisfactory resolution of this difficulty \nand, thus, that the topic of time machines in a general relativistic \nsetting is somewhat ill-defined. This fact does not prevent progress \nfrom being made on the topic; for if one\u2019s aim is to establish no-go \nresults for time machines it suffices to identify necessary \nconditions for the operation of a time machine and then to prove, \nunder suitable hypotheses about what is physically possible, that it \nis not physically possible to satisfy said necessary conditions. In \nSection 4 we review various no-go results which depend only on \nclassical general relativity theory. Section 5 surveys results that \nappeal to quantum effects. Conclusions are presented in Section 6.\n2. What is a (Thornian) time machine? Preliminaries\n\n\nThe setting for the discussion is a general relativistic\nspacetime\n \\((\\mathcal{M},g_{ab})\\) where\n \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is a differentiable manifold and\n\\(g_{ab}\\) is a Lorentz signature metric defined on all\nof \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). The central issue addressed in the\nphysics literature on time machines is whether in this general setting\nit is physically possible to operate a Thornian time machine. This\nissue is to be settled by proving theorems about the solutions to the\nequations that represent what are taken to be physical laws operating\nin the general relativistic setting\u2014or at least this is so once\nthe notion of a Thornian time machine has been explicated.\nUnfortunately, no adequate and generally accepted explication that\nlends itself to the required mathematical proofs is to be found in the\nliterature. This is neither surprising nor deplorable. Mathematical\nphysicists do not wait until some concept has received its final\nexplication before trying to prove theorems about it; indeed, the\nprocess of theorem proving is often an essential part of conceptual\nclarification. The moral is well illustrated by the history of the\nconcept of a spacetime singularity in general relativity where this\nconcept received its now canonical definition only in the process of\nproving the Penrose-Hawking-Geroch singularity theorems, which came at\nthe end of a decades long dispute over the issue of whether spacetime\nsingularities are a generic feature of solutions to Einstein\u2019s\ngravitational field \n equations.[6]\nHowever, this is not to say that philosophers interested in time\nmachines should simply wait until the dust has settled in the physics\nliterature; indeed, the physics literature could benefit from\ndeployment of the analytical skills that are the stock in trade of\nphilosophy. For example, the paradoxes of time travel and the fate of\ntime machines are not infrequently confused in the physics literature,\nand as will become evident below, subtler confusions abound as\nwell.\n\n\nThe question of whether a Thornian time machine\u2014a device that \nproduces CTCs\u2014can be seen to be at work only makes sense if the\nspacetime has at least three features: temporal orientability, a \ndefinite time orientation, and a causally innocuous past. In order to\nmake the notion of a CTC meaningful, the spacetime must be \ntemporally orientable (i.e., must admit a consistent time \ndirectionality), and one of the two possible time orientations has to\nbe singled out as giving the direction of \n time.[7]\n Non-temporal orientability is not really an obstacle since if a given\ngeneral relativistic spacetime is not temporally orientable, a \nspacetime that is everywhere locally the same as the given spacetime \nand is itself temporally orientable can be obtained by passing to a \ncovering \n spacetime.[8]\n How to justify the singling out of one of the two possible \norientations as future pointing requires a solution to the problem of\nthe direction of time, a problem which is still subject to lively \ndebate (see Callender 2001). But for present purposes we simply \nassume that a temporal orientation has been provided. A CTC is then \n(by definition) a parameterized closed spacetime curve whose tangent \nis everywhere a future-pointing timelike vector. A CTC can be thought\nof as the world line of some possible observer whose life history is \nlinearly ordered in the small but not in the large: the observer has \na consistent experience of the \u201cnext moment,\u201d and the \n\u201cnext,\u201d etc., but eventually the \u201cnext \nmoment\u201d brings her back to whatever event she regards as the \nstarting point.\n\n\nAs for the third condition\u2014a causally innocuous past\u2014the \nquestion of the possibility of operating a device that produces CTCs \npresupposes that there is a time before which no CTCs existed. Thus, \nG\u00f6del spacetime, so beloved of the time travel literature, is \nnot a candidate for hosting a Thornian time machine since through \nevery point in this spacetime there is a CTC. We make this third \ncondition precise by requiring that the spacetime admits a global\ntime slice \\(\\Sigma\\) (i.e., a spacelike hypersurface without \n edges);[9]\n that \\(\\Sigma\\) is two-sided and partitions \n \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) into three parts\u2014\\(\\Sigma\\) itself,\nthe part of \n \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) on the past side of \\(\\Sigma\\) and the \npart of \n \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) on the future side of \n\\(\\Sigma\\)\u2014and that there are no CTCs that lie on the past side of\n\\(\\Sigma\\). The first two clauses of this requirement together entail \nthat the time slice \\(\\Sigma\\) is a partial Cauchy surface, \ni.e., \\(\\Sigma\\) is a time slice that is not intersected more than once \nby any future-directed timelike \n curve.[10]\n\n\n\nNow suppose that the state on a partial Cauchy surface \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) with no CTCs to its past is to be thought of as \ngiving a snapshot of the universe at a moment before the machine is \nturned on. The subsequent realization of a Thornian time machine \nscenario requires that the chronology violating region \n\\(V \\subseteq \\mathcal{M}\\), the region of spacetime traced out by\n\n CTCs,[11]\n is non-null and lies to the future of \\(\\Sigma_0\\). The fact \nthat \\(V \\ne \\varnothing\\) does not lead to any consistency \nconstraints on initial data on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) since, by \nhypothesis, \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is not intersected more than once by \nany timelike curve, and thus, insofar as the so-called paradoxes of \ntime travel are concerned with such constraints, the paradoxes do not\narise with respect to \\(\\Sigma_0\\). But by the same token, the\noption of traveling back into the past of \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is \nruled out by the set up as it has been sketched so far, since \notherwise \\(\\Sigma_0\\) would not be a partial Cauchy surface. \nThis just goes to underscore the point made above that the fans of \nscience fiction stories of time machines will not find the present \ncontext of discussion broad enough to encompass their vision of how \ntime machines should operate; they may now stop reading this article \nand return to their novels.\n\n\nFigure 1.\nMisner spacetime\n\n\n\nAs a concrete example of these concepts, consider the \\((1 + \n1)\\)-dimensional Misner spacetime (see \n Figure 1)\n which exhibits some of the causal features of Taub-NUT spacetime, a \nvacuum solution to Einstein\u2019s gravitational field equations. It \nsatisfies all three of the conditions discussed above. It is \ntemporally orientable, and a time orientation has been singled \nout\u2014the shading in the figure indicates the future lobes of the\nlight cones. To the past of the partial Cauchy surface \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) lies the Taub region where the causal structure \nof spacetime is as bland as can be desired. But to the future of \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) the light cones begin to \u201ctip over,\u201d \nand eventually the tipping results in CTCs in the NUT region.\n\n\nThe issue that must be faced now is what further conditions must be \nimposed in order that the appearance of CTCs to the future of \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) can be attributed to the operation of a time \nmachine. Not surprisingly, the answer depends not just on the \nstructure of the spacetime at issue but also on the physical laws \nthat govern the evolution of the spacetime structure. If one adopts \nthe attitude that the label \u201ctime machine\u201d is to be \nreserved for devices that operate within a finite spatial range for a\nfinite stretch of time, then one will want to impose requirements to \nassure that what happens in a compact region of spacetime lying on or\nto the future of \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is responsible for the CTCs. Or \none could be more liberal and allow the would-be time machine to be \nspread over an infinite space. We will adopt the more liberal stance \nsince it avoids various complications while still sufficing to elicit\nkey points. Again, one could reserve the label \u201ctime \nmachine\u201d for devices that manipulate concentrations of \nmass-energy in some specified ways. For example, based on G\u00f6del \nspacetime\u2014where matter is everywhere rotating and a CTC passes \nthrough every spacetime point\u2014one might conjecture that setting\ninto sufficiently rapid rotation a finite mass concentration of \nappropriate shape will eventuate in CTCs. But with the goal in mind \nof proving negative general results, it is better to proceed in a \nmore abstract fashion. Think of the conditions on the partial Cauchy \nsurface \\(\\Sigma_0\\) as encoding the instructions for the \noperation of the time machine. The details of the operation of the \ndevice\u2014whether it operates in a finite region of spacetime, \nwhether it operates by setting matter into rotation, etc.\u2014can \nbe left to the side. What must be addressed, however, is whether the \nprocesses that evolve from the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) can be \ndeemed to be responsible for the subsequent appearance of CTCs.\n3. When can a would-be time machine be held responsible for the emergence of CTCs?\n\n\nThe most obvious move is to construe \u201cresponsible for\u201d in\nthe sense of causal determinism. But in the present setting this move\nquickly runs into a dead end. For if CTCs exist to the future of \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) they are not causally determined by the state on \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) since the time travel region \\(V\\), if it is\nnon-null, lies outside the future domain of dependence \n\\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) of \\(\\Sigma_0\\), \nthe portion of spacetime where the field equations of relativistic \nphysics uniquely determine the state of things from the state on \n \\(\\Sigma_0\\).[12]\n The point is illustrated by the toy model of \n Figure 1.\n The surface labeled \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is \ncalled the future Cauchy horizon of \\(\\Sigma_0\\). It \nis the future boundary of \n \\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\),[13]\n and it separates the portion of spacetime where conditions are \ncausally determined by the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) from the \nportion where conditions are not so determined. And, as advertised, \nthe CTCs in the model of \n Figure 1\n lie beyond \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\).\n\n\nFigure 2.\nDeutsch-Politzer spacetime\n\n\n\nThus, if the operation of a Thornian time machine is to be a live \npossibility, some condition weaker than causal determinism must be \nused to capture the sense in which the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) \ncan be deemed to be responsible for the subsequent development of \nCTCs. Given the failure of causal determinism, it seems the next best\nthing to demand that the region \\(V\\) is \u201cadjacent\u201d \nto the future domain of dependence \n\\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\). Here is an initial stab \nat such an adjacency condition. Consider causal curves which have a \nfuture endpoint in the time travel region \\(V\\) and no past \nendpoint. Such a curve may never leave \\(V\\); but if it does, \nrequire that it intersects \\(\\Sigma_0\\). But this requirement \nis too strong because it rules out Thornian time machines altogether.\nFor a curve of the type in question to reach \\(\\Sigma_0\\) it \nmust intersect \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\), but once \nit reaches \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) it can be \ncontinued endlessly into the past without meeting \\(\\Sigma_0\\)\nbecause the generators of \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\)\nare past endless null geodesics that never meet \n \\(\\Sigma_0\\).[14]\n This difficulty can be overcome by weakening the requirement at issue\nby rephrasing it in terms of timelike curves rather than causal \ncurves. Now the set of candidate time machine spacetimes satisfying \nthe weakened requirement is non-empty\u2014as illustrated, once \nagain, by the spacetime of \n Figure 1.\n But the weakened requirement is too weak, as illustrated by the \\((1 + \n1)\\)-dimensional version of Deutsch-Politzer \n spacetime[15]\n (see \n Figure 2),\n which is constructed from two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime by \ndeleting the points \n\\(p_1\\)\u2013\\(p_4\\) and then gluing \ntogether the strips as shown. Every past endless timelike curve that \nemerges from the time travel region \\(V\\) of Deutsch-Politzer \nspacetime does meet \\(\\Sigma_0\\). But this spacetime is not a \nplausible candidate for a time machine spacetime. Up to and including\nthe time \\(\\Sigma_0\\) (which can be placed as close to \n\\(V\\) as desired) this spacetime is identical with empty \nMinkowski spacetime. If the state of the corresponding portion of \nMinkowski spacetime is not responsible for the development of \nCTCs\u2014and it certainly is not since there are no CTCs in \nMinkowski spacetime\u2014how can the state on the portion of \nDeutsch-Politzer spacetime up to and including the time \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) be held responsible for the CTCs that appear in \nthe future?\n\n\nThe deletion of the points \n\\(p_1\\)\u2013\\(p_4\\) means that the \nDeutsch-Politzer spacetime is singular in the sense that it is \ngeodesically \n incomplete.[16]\n It would be too drastic to require of a time-machine hosting \nspacetime that it be geodesically complete. And in any case the \noffending feature of Deutsch-Politzer can be gotten rid of by the \nfollowing trick. Multiplying the flat Lorentzian metric \n\\(\\eta_{ab}\\) of Deutsch-Politzer spacetime by a scalar\nfunction \\(j(x, t) \\gt\\) produces a new \nmetric \\(\\eta '_{ab} :=\\) j \n\\(\\eta_{ab}\\) which is conformal to the original metric \nand, thus, has exactly the same causal features as the original \nmetric. But if the conformal factor \\(j\\) is chosen to \n\u201cblow up\u201d as the missing points \n\\(p_1\\)\u2013\\(p_4\\) are approached, \nthe resulting spacetime is geodesically complete\u2014intuitively, \nthe singularities have been pushed off to infinity.\n\n\nA more subtle way to exclude Deutsch-Politzer spacetime focuses on \nthe generators of \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\). The \nstipulations laid down so far for Thornian time machines imply that \nthe generators of \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) cannot \nintersect \\(\\Sigma_0\\). But in addition it can be required \nthat these generators do not \u201cemerge from a singularity\u201d \nand do not \u201ccome from infinity,\u201d and this would suffice \nto rule out Deutsch-Politzer spacetime and its conformal cousins as \nlegitimate candidates for time machine spacetimes. More precisely, we\ncan impose what Stephen Hawking (1992a,b) calls the requirement that \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) be compactly \ngenerated; namely, the past endless null geodesics that generate\n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) must, if extended far \nenough into past, fall into and remain in a compact subset of \nspacetime. Obviously the spacetime of \n Figure 1\n fulfills Hawking\u2019s requirement\u2014since in this case \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is itself \ncompact\u2014but just as obviously the spacetime of \n Figure 2\n (conformally doctored or not) does not.\n\n\nImposing the requirement of a compactly generated future Cauchy \nhorizon has not only the negative virtue of excluding some unsuited \ncandidate time machine spacetimes but a positive virtue as well. It \nis easily proved that if \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) \nis compactly generated then the condition of strong \ncausality is violated on \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\), which means, \nintuitively, there are almost closed causal curves near \n \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\).[17]\n This violation can be taken as an indication that the seeds of CTCs \nhave been planted on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) and that by the time \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is reached they are ready\nto bloom.\n\n\nHowever, we still have no guarantee that if CTCs do bloom to the \nfuture of \\(\\Sigma_0\\), then the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) \nis responsible for the blooming. Of course, we have already learned \nthat we cannot have the iron clad guarantee of causal determinism \nthat the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is responsible for the actual \nblooming in all of its particularity. But we might hope for a \nguarantee that the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is responsible for \nthe blooming of some CTCs\u2014the actual ones or others. \nThe difference takes a bit of explaining. The failure of causal \ndeterminism is aptly pictured by the image of a future \n\u201cbranching\u201d of world histories, with the different \nbranches representing different alternative possible futures of (the \ndomain of dependence of) \\(\\Sigma_0\\) that are compatible with\nthe actual past and the laws of physics. And so it is in the present \nsetting: if \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0) \\ne \\varnothing\\), then there will \ngenerally be different ways to extend \n\\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\), all compatible with the \nlaws of general relativistic physics. But if CTCs are present in all \nof these extensions, even through the details of the CTCs may vary \nfrom one extension to another, then the state on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) \ncan rightly be deemed to be responsible for the fact that \nsubsequently CTCs did develop.\n\n\nA theorem due to Krasnikov (2002, 2003 [Other Internet Resources],\n2014a) might seem to demonstrate that no relativistic spacetime can\ncount as embodying a Thornian time machine so understood. Following\nKrasnikov, let us say that a spacetime condition \\(C\\)\nis local just in case, for any open covering\n\\(\\{V_{\\alpha}\\}\\) of an arbitrary spacetime \\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab}),\nC\\) holds in \\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) iff it holds in \\((V_{\\alpha},\ng_{ab}|_{V_{\\alpha}})\\) for all \\(\\alpha\\). Examples of local\nconditions one might want to impose on physically reasonable\nspacetimes are Einstein\u2019s gravitational field equations and\nso-called energy conditions that restrict the form of the\nstress-energy tensor \\(T_{ab}\\). An example of the latter that will\ncome into play below is the weak energy condition that says\nthat the energy density is non-negative.[18] Einstein\u2019s field equations (sans\ncosmological constant) require that \\(T_{ab}\\) is proportional to the\nEinstein tensor which is a functional of the metric and its\nderivatives. Call a \\(C\\)-spacetime \\((\\mathcal{M}', g'_{ab})\\) a\n\\(C\\)-extension of a \\(C\\)-spacetime \\((\\mathcal{M},\ng_{ab})\\) spacetime if the latter is isometric to an open proper\nsubset of the former; and call \\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\nC\\)-extensible if it admits a \\(C\\)-extension and\n\\(C\\)-maximal otherwise. (Of course, \\(C\\) might be the empty\ncondition.) Krasnikov\u2019s theorem shows that every \\(C\\)-spacetime\n\\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) admits a \\(C\\)-maximal extension\n\\((\\mathcal{M}^{max}, g^{max}_{ab})\\) such that all CTCs in\n\\((\\mathcal{M}^{max}, g^{max}_{ab})\\) are to the chronological past of\nthe image of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) in \\((\\mathcal{M}^{max},\ng^{max}_{ab})\\). So start with some candidate spacetime\n\\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) for a Thornian time machine, and apply the\ntheorem to \\((D^+ (\\Sigma_0), g_{ab}|_{D^+ (\\Sigma_0)})\\).  Conclude\nthat no matter what local conditions the candidate spacetime is\nrequired to satisfy, \\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) has extensions that also\nsatisfies said local conditions but does not contain CTCs to the\nfuture of \\(\\Sigma_0\\). Thus, the candidate spacetime fails to exhibit\nthe crucial feature identified above necessary for underwriting the\ncontention that the conditions on \\(\\Sigma_0\\) are responsible for the\ndevelopment of CTCs.  Hence, it appears as if Krasnikov\u2019s\ntheorem effectively prohibits time machines. \n\n\nThe would-be time machine operator need not capitulate in the face of\nKrasnikov\u2019s theorem. Recall that the main difficulty in\nspecifying the conditions for the successful operation of Thornian\ntime machines traces to the fact that the standard form of causal\ndeterminism does not apply to the production of CTCs. But causal\ndeterminism can fail for reasons that have nothing to do with CTCs or\nother acausal features of relativistic spacetimes, and it seems only\nfair to ensure that these modes of failure have been removed before\nproceeding to discuss the prospects for time machines. To zero in on\nthe modes of failure at issue, consider vacuum solutions \\((T_{ab}\n\\equiv 0)\\) to Einstein\u2019s field equations. Let \\((\\mathcal{M},\ng_{ab})\\) and \\((\\mathcal{M}', g'_{ab})\\) be two such solutions, and\nlet \\(\\Sigma \\subset \\mathcal{M}\\) and \\(\\Sigma ' \\subset\n\\mathcal{M}'\\) be spacelike hypersurfaces of their respective\nspacetimes. Suppose that there is an isometry \\(\\Psi\\) from some\nneighborhood \\(N(\\Sigma)\\) of \\(\\Sigma\\) onto a neighborhood\n\\(N'(\\Sigma ')\\) of \\(\\Sigma '\\).  Does it follow, as we would want\ndeterminism to guarantee, that \\(\\Psi\\) is extendible to an isometry\nfrom \\(D^+ (\\Sigma)\\) onto \\(D^+ (\\Sigma ')\\)? To see why the answer\nis negative, start with any solution \\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) of the\nvacuum Einstein equations, and cut out a closed set of points lying to\nthe future of \\(N(\\Sigma)\\) and in \\(D^+ (\\Sigma)\\).  Denote the\nsurgically altered manifold by \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) and the restriction\nof \\(g_{ab}\\) to \\(\\mathcal{M}^*\\) by \\(g^*_{ab}\\). Then\n\\((\\mathcal{M}^*, g^*_{ab})\\) is also a solution of the vacuum\nEinstein equations. But obviously the pair of solutions\n\\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) and \\((\\mathcal{M}^*, g^*_{ab})\\) violates\nthe condition that determinism was supposed to guarantee as \\(\\Psi\\)\nis not extendible to an isometry from \\(D^+ (\\Sigma)\\) onto \\(D^+\n(\\Sigma^*)\\). It might seem that the requirement, contemplated above,\nthat the spacetimes under consideration be maximal, already rules out\nspacetimes that have \u201choles\u201d in them. But while maximality\ndoes rule out the surgically mutilated spacetime just constructed, it\ndoes not guarantee hole freeness in the sense needed to make sure that\ndeterminism does not stumble before it gets to the starting gate.\nThat \\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) is hole free in the relevant sense\nrequires that if \\(\\Sigma \\subset \\mathcal{M}\\) is a spacelike\nhypersurface, there does not exist a spacetime \\((\\mathcal{M}',\ng'_{ab})\\) and an isometric embedding \\(\\Phi\\) of \\(D^+ (\\Sigma)\\)\ninto \\(\\mathcal{M}'\\) such that \\(\\Phi(D^+ (\\Sigma))\\) is a proper\nsubset of \\(D^+ (\\Phi(\\Sigma))\\). A theorem due to Robert Geroch\n(1977, 87), who is responsible for this definition, asserts that if\n\\(\\Sigma \\subset \\mathcal{M}\\) and \\(\\Sigma ' \\subset \\mathcal{M}'\\)\nare spacelike hypersurfaces in hole-free spacetimes \\((\\mathcal{M},\ng_{ab})\\) and \\((\\mathcal{M}', g'_{ab})\\), respectively, and if there\nexists an isometry \\(\\Psi : \\mathcal{M} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}'\\),\nthen \\(\\Psi\\) is indeed extendible to an isometry between \\(D^+\n(\\Sigma)\\) and \\(D^+ (\\Sigma ')\\). Thus, hole freeness precludes an\nimportant mode of failure of determinism which we wish to exclude in\nour discussion of time machines. It can be shown that hole freeness is\nnot entailed by maximality.[19] And it is just this gap that gives the\nwould-be time machine operator some hope, for the maximal CTC-free\nextensions produced by Krasnikov\u2019s construction are not always\nhole free (Manchak 2009b). But Krasnikov (2009) has shown that the\nGeroch (1977) definition is too strong: Minkowski spacetime fails to\nsatisfy it! For this reason, alternative formulations of the\nhole-freeness definition have been constructed which are more\nappropriate (Manchak 2009a, Minguzzi 2012).\n\n\n\nThus, we propose that one clear sense of what it would mean for a\nThornian time machine to operate in the setting of general relativity\ntheory is given by the following assertion: the laws of general\nrelativistic physics allow solutions containing a partial Cauchy\nsurface \\(\\Sigma_0\\) such that no CTCs lie to the past of\n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) but every extension of\n\\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) satisfying ________\ncontains CTCs (where the blank is filled with some \u201cno\nhole\u201d condition). Correspondingly, a proof of the physical\nimpossibility of time machines would take the form of showing that\nthis assertion is false for the actual laws of physics, consisting,\npresumably, of Einstein\u2019s field equations plus energy conditions and,\nperhaps, some additional restrictions as well. And a proof of the\nemptiness of the associated concept of a Thornian time machine would\ntake the form of showing that the assertion is false independently of\nthe details of the laws of physics, as long as they take the form of\nlocal conditions on \\(T_{ab}\\) and \\(g_{ab}\\).\n\n\nAre there \"no hole\" conditions which show the proposed concept of a time machine is not empty? Let \\(J^+(p)\\) designate the causal future of \\(p\\), defined as the set of all points in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) which can be reached from \\(p\\) by a future-directed causal curve in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). The causal past \\(J^-(p)\\) is defined analogously. Now, we say a spacetime \\((\\mathcal{M},g_{ab})\\) is J closed if, for each \\(p\\) in \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), the sets \\(J^+(p)\\) and \\(J^-(p)\\) are topologically closed. One can verify that J closedness fails in many artificially mutilated examples (e.g. Minkowski spacetime with one point removed from the manifold). For some time, it was thought that a time machine existed under this no-hole condition (Manchak 2011a). But this turns out to be incorrect; indeed a recent result shows that any J closed spacetime \\((\\mathcal{M},g_{ab})\\) of three dimensions or more with chronology violating region \\(V \\neq \\mathcal{M}\\) must be strongly causal and therefore fail to have CTCs (Hounnonkpe and Minguzzi 2019). Stepping back, perhaps there are other no-hole conditions which can be used instead to show that the proposed concept of a time machine is not empty. But even if such a project were successful, Manchak (2014a, 2019) has shown that the time machine existence results can be\nnaturally reinterpreted as \u201chole machine\u201d existence results if one is so inclined. Instead of assuming that spacetime is\nfree of holes and then showing that certain initial conditions are\nresponsible for the production of CTCs, one could just as well start\nwith the assumption of no CTCs and then show that certain initial\nconditions are responsible for the production of holes. Given the\nimportance of these no hole assumptions to the time machine advocate,\nmuch recent work has focused on whether such assumptions are\nphysically reasonable in some sense (Manchak 2011b,\n2014b). This is still an open question.\n\n\nAnother open question is whether physically more realistic spacetimes\nthan Misner also permit the operation of time machines and how generic\ntime-machine spacetimes are in particular spacetime theories, such as\ngeneral relativity. If time-machine spacetimes turn out to be highly\nnon-generic, the fan of time machines can retreat to a weaker concept\nof Thornian time machine by taking a page from probabilistic accounts\nof causation, the idea being that a time machine can be seen to be at\nwork if its operation increases the probability of the appearance of\nCTCs. Since general relativity theory itself is innocent of\nprobabilities, they have to be introduced by hand, either by inserting\nthem into the models of the theory, i.e., by modifying the theory at\nthe level of the object-language, or by defining measures on sets of\nmodels, i.e., by modifying the theory at the level of the\nmeta-language. Since the former would change the character of the\ntheory, only the latter will be considered. The project for making\nsense of the notion that a time machine as a probabilistic cause of\nthe appearance of CTCs would then take the following form. First\ndefine a normalized measure on the set of models having a partial\nCauchy surface to the past of which there are no CTCs. Then show that\nthe subset of models that have CTCs to the future of the partial\nCauchy surface has non-zero measure. Next, identify a range of\nconditions on or near the partial Cauchy surface that are naturally\nconstrued as settings of a device that is a would-be probabilistic\ncause of CTCs, and show that the subset of models satisfying these\nconditions has non-zero measure. Finally, show that conditionalizing\non the latter subset increases the measure of the former\nsubset. Assuming that this formal exercise can be successfully carried\nout, there remains the task of justifying these as measures of\nobjective chance. This task is especially daunting in the cosmological\nsetting since neither of the leading interpretations of objective\nchance seems applicable. The frequency interpretation is strained\nsince the development of CTCs may be a non-repeated phenomenon; and\nthe propensity interpretation is equally strained since, barring\njust-so stories about the Creator throwing darts at the Cosmic Dart\nBoard, there is no chance mechanism for producing cosmological\nmodels.\n\n\nWe conclude that, even apart from general doubts about a \nprobabilistic account of causation, the resort to a probabilistic \nconception of time machines is a desperate stretch, at least in the \ncontext of classical general relativity theory. In a quantum theory \nof gravity, a probabilistic conception of time machines may be \nappropriate if the theory itself provides the transition \nprobabilities between the relevant states. But an evaluation of this \nprospect must wait until the theory of quantum gravity is available.\n4. No-go results for (Thornian) time machines in classical general relativity theory\n\n\nIn order to appreciate the physics literature aimed at proving no-go \nresults for time machines it is helpful to view these efforts as part\nof the broader project of proving chronology protections \ntheorems, which in turn is part of a still larger project of \nproving cosmic censorship theorems. To explain, we start \nwith cosmic censorship and work backwards.\n\n\nFigure 3.\nA bad choice of initial value surface\n\n\n\nFor sake of simplicity, concentrate on the initial value problem for \nvacuum solutions \\((T_{ab} \\equiv 0)\\) to Einstein\u2019s \nfield equations. Start with a three-manifold \\(\\Sigma\\) equipped with \nquantities which, when \\(\\Sigma\\) is embedded as a spacelike submanifold\nof spacetime, become initial data for the vacuum field equations. \nCorresponding to the initial data there exists a \n unique[20]\n maximal development \n \\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) for which (the image \nof the embedded) \\(\\Sigma\\) is a Cauchy \n surface.[21]\n This solution, however, may not be maximal simpliciter, i.e., it may \nbe possible to isometrically embed it as a proper part of a larger \nspacetime, which itself may be a vacuum solution to the field \nequations; if so \\(\\Sigma\\) will not be a Cauchy surface for the \nextended spacetime, which fails to be a globally hyperbolic \n spacetime.[22]\n This situation can arise because of a poor choice of initial value \nhypersurface, as illustrated in \n Figure 3\n by taking \\(\\Sigma\\) to be the indicated spacelike hyperboloid of \\((1 + \n1)\\)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. But, more interestingly, the \nsituation can arise because the Einstein equations allow various \npathologies, collectively referred to as \u201cnaked \nsingularities,\u201d to develop from regular initial data. The \nstrong form of Penrose\u2019s celebrated cosmic censorship \nconjecture proposes that, consistent with Einstein\u2019s field \nequations, such pathologies do not arise under physically reasonable \nconditions or else that the conditions leading to the pathologies are\nhighly non-generic within the space of all solutions to the field \nequations. A small amount of progress has been made on stating and \nproving precise versions of this \n conjecture.[23]\n\n\n\nOne way in which strong cosmic censorship can be violated is through \nthe emergence of acausal features. Returning to the example of Misner\nspacetime \n (Figure 1),\n the spacetime up to \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is \nthe unique maximal development of the vacuum Einstein equations for \nwhich \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is a Cauchy surface. But this development \nis extendible, and in the extension illustrated in \n Figure 1\n global hyperbolicity of the development is lost because of the \npresence of CTCs. The chronology protection conjecture then \ncan be construed as a subconjecture of the cosmic censorship \nconjecture, saying, roughly, that consistent with Einstein field \nequations, CTCs do not arise under physically reasonable conditions \nor else that the conditions are highly non-generic within the space \nof all solutions to the field equations. No-go results for time \nmachines are then special forms of chronology protection theorems \nthat deal with cases where the CTCs are manufactured by time \nmachines. In the other direction, a very general chronology \nprotection theorem will automatically provide a no-go result for time\nmachines, however that notion is understood, and a theorem \nestablishing strong cosmic censorship will automatically impose \nchronology protection.\n\n\nThe most widely discussed chronology protection theorem/no-go result \nfor time machines in the context of classical general relativity \ntheory is due to Hawking (1992a). Before stating the result, note \nfirst that, independently of the Einstein field equations and energy \nconditions, a partial Cauchy surface \\(\\Sigma\\) must be compact if its \nfuture Cauchy horizon \\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) is compact (see\nHawking 1992a and Chrusciel and Isenberg 1993). However, it is \ngeometrically allowed that \\(\\Sigma\\) is non-compact if \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) is required only to be compactly \ngenerated rather than compact. But what Hawking showed is that this \ngeometrical possibility is ruled out by imposing Einstein\u2019s field \nequations and the weak energy condition. Thus, if \\(\\Sigma_0\\)\nis a partial Cauchy surface representing the situation just before or\njust as the would-be Thornian time machine is switched on, and if a \nnecessary condition for seeing a Thornian time machine at work is \nthat \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is compactly \ngenerated, then consistently with Einstein\u2019s field equations and the \nweak energy condition, a Thornian time machine cannot operate in a \nspatially open universe since \\(\\Sigma_0\\) must be compact.\n\n\nThis no-go result does not touch the situation illustrated in \n Figure 1.\n Taub-NUT spacetime is a vacuum solution to Einstein\u2019s field equations\nso the weak energy condition is automatically satisfied, and \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is compact and, a \nfortiori, compactly generated. Hawking\u2019s theorem is not contradicted \nsince \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is compact. By the same token the theorem \ndoes not speak to the possibility of operating a Thornian time \nmachine in a spatially closed universe. To help fill the gap, Hawking\nproved that when \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is compact and \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is compactly generated, \nthe Einstein field equations and the weak energy condition together \nguarantee that both the convergence and shear of the null geodesic \ngenerators of \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) must \nvanish, which he interpreted to imply that no observers can cross \nover \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) to enter the \nchronology violating region \\(V\\). But rather than showing that \nit is physically impossible to operate a Thornian time machine in a \nclosed universe, this result shows only that, given the correctness \nof Hawking\u2019s interpretation, the observers who operate the time \nmachine cannot take advantage of the CTCs it produces.\n\n\nThere are two sources of doubt about the effectiveness of Hawking\u2019s \nno-go result even for open universes. The first stems from possible \nviolations of the weak energy condition by stress-energy tensors \narising from classical relativistic matter fields (see Vollick 1997 \nand Visser and Barcelo \n 2000).[24]\n The second stems from the fact that Hawking\u2019s theorem functions as a \nchronology protection theorem only by way of serving as a potential \nno-go result for Thornian time machines since the crucial condition \nthat \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is compactly \ngenerated is supposedly justified by being a necessary condition for \nthe operation of such machine. But in retrospect, the motivation for \nthis condition seems frayed. As argued in the previous section, if \nthe Einstein field equations and energy conditions entail that all \nhole free extensions of \\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) \ncontain CTCs, then it is plausible to see a Thornian time machine at \nwork, quite regardless ofwhether or not \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is compactly generated or\nnot. Of course, it remains to establish the existence of cases where \nthis entailment holds. If it should turn out that there are no such \ncases, then the prospects of Thornian time machines are dealt a \nsevere blow, but the reasons are independent of Hawking\u2019s theorem. On\nthe other hand, if such cases do exist then our conjecture would be \nthat they exist even when some of the generators of \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) come from singularities \nor infinity and, thus, \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is\nnot compactly \n generated.[25]\n\n5. No-go results in quantum gravity\n\n\nThree degrees of quantum involvement in gravity can be distinguished.\nThe first degree, referred to as quantum field theory on curved \nspacetimes, simply takes off the shelf a spacetime provided by \ngeneral relativity theory and then proceeds to study the behavior of \nquantum fields on this background spacetime. The Unruh effect, which \npredicts the thermalization of a free scalar quantum field near the \nhorizon of a black hole, lies within this ambit. The second degree of\ninvolvement, referred to as semi-classical quantum gravity, attempts \nto calculate the backreaction of the quantum fields on spacetime \nmetric by computing the expectation value \n\\(\\langle \\Psi \\mid T_{ab} \\mid \\Psi \\rangle\\) of the stress-energy \ntensor in some appropriate quantum state \\(\\lvert\\Psi\\rangle\\) and then \ninserting the value into Einstein\u2019s field equations in place of \n\\(T_{ab}\\).[26]\n Hawking\u2019s celebrated prediction of black hole radiation belongs to \nthis \n ambit.[27]\n The third degree of involvement attempts to produce a genuine quantum\ntheory of gravity in the sense that the gravitational degrees of \nfreedom are quantized. Currently loop quantum gravity and string \ntheory are the main research programs aimed at this \n goal.[28]\n\n\n\nThe first degree of quantum involvement, if not opening the door to \nThornian time machines, at least seemed to remove some obstacles \nsince quantum fields are known to lead to violations of the energy \nconditions used in the setting of classical general relativity theory\nto prove chronology protection theorems and no-go results for time \nmachines. However, the second degree of quantum involvement seemed, \nat least initially, to slam the door shut. The intuitive idea was \nthis. Start with a general relativistic spacetime where CTCs develop \nto the future of \\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) (often referred to \nas the \u201cchronology horizon\u201d) for some suitable partial \nCauchy surface \\(\\Sigma\\). Find that the propagation of a quantum field \non this spacetime background is such that \n\\(\\langle \\Psi \\mid T_{ab} \\mid\\Psi \\rangle\\) \u201cblows up\u201d as\n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) is approached from the past. Conclude\nthat the backreaction on the spacetime metric creates unbounded \ncurvature, which effectively cuts off the future development that \nwould otherwise eventuate in CTCs. These intuitions were partly \nvindicated by detailed calculations in several models. But eventually\na number of exceptions were found in which the backreaction remains \narbitrarily small near \n \\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\).[29]\n This seemed to leave the door ajar for Thornian time machines.\n\n\nBut fortunes were reversed once again by a result of Kay, \nRadzikowski, and Wald (1997). The details of their theorem are too \ntechnical to review here, but the structure of the argument is easy \nto grasp. The na\u00efve calculation of \n\\(\\langle \\Psi \\mid T_{ab}\\mid\\Psi \\rangle\\) results in infinities \nwhich have to be subtracted off to produce a renormalized expectation\nvalue \n\\(\\langle \\Psi \\mid T_{ab}\\mid\\Psi \\rangle_R\\) with\na finite value. The standard renormalization procedure uses a \nlimiting procedure that is mathematically well-defined if, and only \nif, a certain condition \n obtains.[30]\n The KRW theorem shows that this condition is violated for points on \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) and, thus, that the expectation value\nof the stress-energy tensor is not well-defined at the chronology \nhorizon.\n\n\nWhile the KRW theorem is undoubtedly of fundamental importance for \nsemi-classical quantum gravity, it does not serve as an effective \nno-go result for Thornian time machines. In the first place, the \ntheorem assumes, in concert with Hawking\u2019s chronology protection \ntheorem, that \\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) is compactly generated,\nand we repeat that it is far from clear that this assumption is \nnecessary for seeing a Thornian time machine in operation. A second, \nand more fundamental, reservation applies even if a compactly \ngenerated \\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) is accepted as a necessary \ncondition for time machines. The KRW theorem functions as a no-go \nresult by providing a reductio ad absurdum with a dubious \nabsurdity: roughly, if you try to operate a Thornian time machine, \nyou will end up invalidating semi-classical quantum gravity. But \nsemi-classical quantum gravity was never viewed as anything more than\na stepping stone to a genuine quantum theory of gravity, and its \nbreakdown is expected to be manifested when Planck-scale physics \ncomes into play. This worry is underscored by Visser\u2019s (1997, 2003) \nfindings that in chronology violating models trans-Planckian physics \ncan be expected to come into play before \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) is reached.\n\n\nIt thus seems that if some quantum mechanism is to serve as the basis\nfor chronology protection, it must be found in the third degree of \nquantum involvement in gravity. Both loop quantum gravity and string \ntheory have demonstrated the ability to cure some of the curvature \nsingularities of classical general relativity theory. But as far as \nwe are aware there are no demonstrations that either of these \napproaches to quantum gravity can get rid of the acausal features \nexhibited in various solutions to Einstein\u2019s field equations. An \nalternative approach to formulate a fully-fledged quantum theory of \ngravity attempts to capture the Planck-scale structure of spacetime \nby constructing it from causal \n sets.[31]\n Since these sets must be acyclic, i.e., no element in a causal set \ncan causally precede itself, CTCs are ruled out a priori. Actually, a\ntheorem due to Malament (1977) suggests that any Planck-scale \napproach encoding only the causal structure of a spacetime cannot \npermit CTCs either in the smooth classical spacetimes or a \ncorresponding phenomenon in their quantum \n counterparts.[32]\n\n\n\nIn sum, the existing no-go results that use the first two degrees of \nquantum involvement are not very convincing, and the third degree of \ninvolvement is not mature enough to allow useful pronouncements. \nThere is, however, a rapidly growing literature on the possibility of\ntime travel in lower-dimensional supersymmetric cousins of string \ntheory. For a review of these recent results and a discussion of the \nfate of a time-traveller\u2019s ambition in loop quantum gravity, see \nSmeenk and W\u00fcthrich (2010).\n6. Conclusion\n\n\nHawking opined that \u201c[i]t seems there is a chronology \nprotection agency, which prevents the appearance of closed timelike \ncurves and so makes the universe safe for historians\u201d (1992a, \n603). He may be right, but to date there are no convincing arguments \nthat such an Agency is housed in either classical general relativity \ntheory or in semi-classical quantum gravity. And it is too early to \ntell whether this Agency is housed in loop quantum gravity or string \ntheory. But even if it should turn out that Hawking is wrong in that \nthe laws of physics do not support a Chronology Protection Agency, it\ncould still be the case that the laws support an Anti-Time Machine \nAgency. For it could turn out that while the laws do not prevent the \ndevelopment of CTCs, they also do not make it possible to attribute \nthe appearance of CTCs to the workings of any would-be time machine. \nWe argued that a strong presumption in favor of the latter would be \ncreated in classical general relativity theory by the demonstration \nthat for any model satisfying Einstein\u2019s field equations and energy \nconditions as well as possessing a partial Cauchy surface \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) to the future of which there are CTCs, there are \nhole free extensions of \\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) \nsatisfying Einstein\u2019s field equations and energy conditions but \ncontaining no CTCs to the future of \\(\\Sigma_0\\). There are no doubt alternative approaches to\nunderstanding what it means for a device to be \u201cresponsible \nfor\u201d the development of CTCs. Exploring these alternatives is \none place that philosophers can hope to make a contribution to an \nongoing discussion that, to date, has been carried mainly by the \nphysics community. Participating in this discussion means that \nphilosophers have to forsake the activity of logical gymnastics with \nthe paradoxes of time travel for the more arduous but (we believe) \nrewarding activity of digging into the foundations of physics.\n\n\nTime machines may never see daylight, and perhaps so for principled \nreasons that stem from basic physical laws. But even if mathematical \ntheorems in the various theories concerned succeed in establishing \nthe impossibility of time machines, understanding why time machines \ncannot be constructed will shed light on central problems in the \nfoundations of physics. As we have argued in Section 4, for instance,\nthe hunt for time machines in general relativity theory should be \ninterpreted as a core issue in studying the fortunes of Penrose\u2019s \ncosmic censorship conjecture. This conjecture arguably constitutes \nthe most important open problem in general relativity theory. \nSimilarly, as discussed in Section 5, mathematical theorems related \nto various aspects of time machines offer results relevant for the \nsearch of a quantum theory of gravity. In sum, studying the \npossibilities for operating a time machine turns out to be not a \nscientifically peripheral or frivolous weekend activity but a useful \nway of probing the foundations of classical and quantum theories of \ngravity.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Arntzenius, F. and T.
