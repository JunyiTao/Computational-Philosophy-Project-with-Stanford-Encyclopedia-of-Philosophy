    "main_text": "Teleology || Teleology, Morality and Religion\n3.6 Teleology, Morality and Religion\n\nPart of Kant\u2019s aim in the \u201cCritique of Teleological\nJudgment\u201d is to clarify the relation of natural teleology to\nreligion, and to argue in particular against\n\u201cphysicoteleology\u201d, that is, the attempt to use natural\nteleology to prove the existence of God. (The topic of physicotheology\nwas of concern to Kant throughout his career: Kant proposes a\n\u201crevised physicotheology\u201d in the Only Possible\nArgument for the Existence of God (1763), and offers a more\nfar-reaching criticism of physicotheology in the Critique of Pure\nReason, at A620/B648ff.) Appeal to natural teleology may justify\nthe assumption of an intelligent cause of nature, but it cannot\njustify the assumption that this cause has wisdom, let alone that it\nis infinite in every respect, and in particular supremely wise\n(\u00a785, 441). For this we need to appeal, not to natural, but to\nmoral, teleology, and in particular to the idea (itself belonging not\nto natural, but to moral teleology) of man as final purpose of nature.\nThe idea of nature as purposively directed towards the existence of\nrational beings under moral laws allows us to conceive of an author of\nnature who is not merely intelligent, but also has the other\nattributes associated with the traditional idea of God, for example\nomniscience, omnipotence and wisdom (which includes omnibenificence\nand justice) (\u00a786, 444). We have to assume the existence of a\nbeing with these attributes if we ourselves are to adopt the purpose\nrequired by the moral law, a purpose which Kant calls the\n\u201chighest good\u201d and which is discussed in his moral\nwritings.\n\nAlthough natural teleology cannot prove the existence of God, it\nnonetheless has a positive role to play with respect to religion and\nmorality, in that it leads us to ask what the final purpose of nature\nis, and relatedly, to inquire into the attributes of God as author of\nnature. Thus, as Kant puts it, it \u201cdrives us to seek a\ntheology\u201d (\u00a785, 440), and thus serves as a preparation or\n\u201cpropadeutic\u201d to theology (\u00a785, 442). Kant also\nclaims that \u201cif the cognition of natural purposes is connected\nwith that of the moral purpose\u201d then \u201cit is of great\nsignificance for assisting the practical reality of the idea [of\nGod]\u201d (\u00a788, 456). The positive role of natural teleology in\nestablishing religion and morality has been emphasized by Guyer (see\nespecially 2000, 2001b, 2002a), who takes the \u201cCritique of\nTeleological Judgment\u201d to provide an important argument from\nnatural teleology to morality.\n\nA different kind of connection between Kant\u2019s natural teleology\nand his views about morality is suggested in Kain 2009, which\ninterprets Kant\u2019s biological theories as supporting his view\nthat all members of the human species (including infants and the\nseverely disabled) have moral status.\n\nThe connection between teleology and morality is often thought to be\ncentral to making sense of the Critique of Judgment as a\nunified work; see\n Section 1.\n",
