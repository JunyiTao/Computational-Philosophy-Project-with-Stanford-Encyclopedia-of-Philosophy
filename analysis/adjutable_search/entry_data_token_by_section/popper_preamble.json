    "main_text": "\n\nKarl Popper is generally regarded as one of the greatest philosophers\nof science of the twentieth century. He was also a social and\npolitical philosopher of considerable stature, a self-professed\ncritical-rationalist, a dedicated opponent of all forms of scepticism\nand relativism in science and in human affairs generally and a\ncommitted advocate and staunch defender of the \u201cOpen\nSociety\u201d. One of the many remarkable features of Popper\u2019s\nthought is the scope of his intellectual influence: he was lauded by\nBertrand Russell, taught Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend and\nphilanthropist George Soros at the London School of Economics,\nnumbered David Miller, Joseph Agassi, Alan Musgrave and Jeremy\nShearmur amongst his research assistants, was counted by Thomas Szasz\nas \u201camong my foremost teachers\u201d and had close ties with\nthe economist Friedrich Hayek and the art historian Ernst Gombrich.\nAdditionally, Peter Medawar, John Eccles and Hermann Bondi are amongst\nthe distinguished scientists who have acknowledged their intellectual\nindebtedness to his work, the latter declaring that \u201cThere is no\nmore to science than its method, and there is no more to its method\nthan Popper has said\u201d.\n",
