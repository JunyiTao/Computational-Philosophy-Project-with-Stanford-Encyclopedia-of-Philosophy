    "main_text": "Religion\n4. Significance and Legacy\n\nPaine\u2019s religious views, not unlike his political views, are not\nespecially original or subtle. They follow much of the deist writing\nof the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. But, as with\nmuch Paine wrote, the bluntness and sweeping rhetoric that alienates\nthe more philosophically inclined modern reader were an essential\nelement in his success and his continuing importance. Paine spoke to\nordinary people\u2014and they read him in their\nthousands\u2014indeed, he was often read aloud in public houses and\ncoffee shops. He claimed no authority over them, but helped them to\ndoubt those who did claim such authority, whether civil or religious,\nand he affirmed over and over again their right and responsibility to\nthink for themselves and to reach their own judgment on matters. He\ndid so at a time when the press had become capable of reaching even\nthe poorest of society\u2014when the Attorney General launched the\nprosecution of Rights of Man (1792) he distinguished between\nthe first part, which was \u2018ushered into the world under\ncircumstances that led me to conceive that it would be confined to the\njudicious reader\u2019, and the second part, which \u2018with an\nindustry incredible, it was either totally or partially thrust into\nthe hands of all persons in this country, of subjects of every\ndescription\u2026Gentlemen, to whom are those positions, that are\ncontained in this book addressed\u2026to the ignorant, to the\ncredulous, to the desperate.\u2019 (State Trails v. 22,\n381\u20133).\n\nPaine would have embraced the description\u2014although he was less\nof a \u2018common man\u2019 than many who have subsequently\neulogized him make him out to be. In many respects, he was a\nmoderately respectable radical, with a deep suspicion of the\nhierarchical systems of Europe, a brimming confidence in his own\njudgment that his experience in America confirmed\u2014which\nexpressed itself in his willingness to tackle a range of subject\nareas, including bridge-building and scientific experiments\u2014and\nwith a growing sense that he knew how to communicate, with powerful\neffect, with a popular audience at exactly the point at which that\npopular audience was beginning to feel and test its political\ninfluence.\n\nPaine was vehemently attacked in his own lifetime\u2014if the\nscurrilous biography was not invented for him it certainly attained\nsomething of an art form in his depiction. He was outlawed in England,\nnearly lost his life in France, and was largely ostracized and\nexcluded when he returned to America. A sizable collection of papers\nat his New Rochelle farm were destroyed in a fire, and his oeuvre\nremains contested, at least at the margins. Biographers have drawn\nheavily on early work by Moncure Conway, but while several new\naccounts appear each decade few add much to our knowledge. Serious\nanalysis of his ideas is relatively rare, and tends to be more\nhistorically than philosophically orientated (although recent work by\nRobert Lamb does give his ideas serious philosophical attention, and\nvan Parijs\u2019s work on Basic Income recognizes his importance).\nBut until very recently he has remained on the edges of the canon of\npolitical thought, easily dismissed by those who want more substantial\nphilosophical fare, and subject to fits of enthusiasm by writers who\nare either insufficiently attuned to the complexities of the period or\nare simply uncritical. Such an attitude does poor service to the\nhistory, to the ideas, or to the man.\n",
