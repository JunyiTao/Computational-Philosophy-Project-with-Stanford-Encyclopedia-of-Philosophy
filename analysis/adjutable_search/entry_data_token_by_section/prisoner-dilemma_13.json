    "main_text": "Indefinite Iteration\n14. Indefinite Iteration\n\nMost contemporary investigations the IPD take it to be neither\ninfinite nor of fixed finite length but rather of indeterminate\nlength. This is accomplished by including in the game specification a\nprobability \\(p\\) (the \u201cshadow of the future\u201d) such that\nat each round the game will continue with probability \\(p\\).\nAlternatively, a \u201cdiscount factor\u201d \\(p\\) is applied to the\npayoffs after each round so that nearby payoffs are valued more highly\nthan distant ones. Mathematically, it makes little difference whether\n\\(p\\) is regarded as a probability of continuation or a discount on\npayoffs. The value of cooperation at a given stage in an IPD clearly\ndepends on the odds of meeting one's opponent in later rounds. (This\nhas been said to explain why the level of courtesy is higher in a\nvillage than a metropolis and why customers tend leave better tips in\nlocal restaurants than distant ones.) As \\(p\\) approaches zero, the\nIPD becomes a one-shot PD, and the value of defection increases. As\n\\(p\\) approaches one the IPD becomes an infinite IPD, and the value of\ndefection decreases. It is also customary to insist that the game has\nthe property labeled RCA above, so that (in the symmetric game)\nplayers do better by cooperating on every round than they would do by\n\u201ctaking turns\u201d \u2014 you cooperate while I defect and\nthen I cooperate while you defect.\n\nThere is an observation, apparently originating in Kavka 1983, and\ngiven more mathematical form in Carroll, that the backward induction\nargument applies as long as an upper bound to the length of the game\nis common knowledge. For if \\(b\\) is such an upper bound, then, if the\nplayers were to get to stage \\(b\\), they would know that it was the\nlast round and they would defect; if they were to get to stage\n\\(b-1\\), they would know that their behavior on this round cannot\naffect the decision to defect on the next, and so they would defect;\nand so on. It seems an easy matter to compute upper bounds on the\nnumber of interactions in real-life situations. For example, since\nshopkeeper Jones cannot make more than one sale a second and since he\nwill live less than a thousand years, he and customer Smith can\ncalculate (conservatively) that they cannot possibly conduct more than\n\\(10^{12}\\) transactions. It is instructive to examine this argument\nmore closely in order to dramatize the assumptions made in standard\ntreatments of the indefinite IPD and other indefinitely repeated\ngames. Note first that, in an indefinite IPD as described above, there\ncan be no upper bound on the length of the game. There is, instead,\nsome fixed probability \\(p\\) that, at any time in which the game is\nstill being played, it will continue to be played with probability\n\\(p\\). If the interaction of Smith and Jones were modeled as an\nindefinite IPD, therefore, the probability of their interacting in a\nthousand years would not be zero, but rather some number greater than\n\\(p^k\\) where \\(p\\) is the probability of their interacting again now\nand \\(k\\) is the number of seconds in a thousand years. A more\nrealistic way to model the interaction might be to allow the value of\n\\(p\\) to decrease as the game progressed. As long as \\(p\\) always\nremains greater than zero, however, it remains true that there can be\nno upper bound on the number of possible interactions, i.e., no time\nat which the probability of future interactions becomes zero. Suppose,\non the other hand, that there was a number \\(n\\) such that\nthat there was zero probability of the game's continuing to stage\n\\(n\\). Let \\(p_1, \\ldots, p_n\\), be the probabilities that game\ncontinues after \\(\\text{stage } 1, \\ldots, \\text{stage } n\\). Then\nthere must be a smallest \\(i\\) such that \\(p_i\\) becomes \\(0\\). (It\nwould happen at \\(i=n\\) if not sooner.) Given the standard common\nknowledge assumptions that we have been making, the players would know\nthis value of \\(i\\), and the IPD would be one of fixed length, and not\nan indefinite IPD at all. In the case of the shopkeeper and his\ncustomer, we are to suppose that both know today that their last\ninteraction will occur, let's say, at noon on June 10th, 2020. The\nvery plausible idea that we began with, viz., that some upper\nbounds on the number of interactions are common knowledge, even though\nthe smallest upper bound is not, is incompatible with the assumption\nthat we know all the continuation probabilities \\(p_i\\) from the\nstart.\n\nAs Becker and Cudd astutely observe, we don't need an upper bound on\nthe number of possible iterations to make a backward induction\nargument for defection possible. If the players know all the values of\n\\(p_i\\) from the outset, then, as long as the value of \\(p_i\\) becomes\nand remains sufficiently small, they (and we) can compute a stage\n\\(k\\) at which the risk of future punishment and the chance of future\nreward no longer outweighs the benefit of immediate defection. So they\nknow their opponent will defect at stage \\(k\\), and the induction\nbegins. This modification of the Kavka/Carroll argument, however, only\nfurther exposes the implausibility of its assumptions. Not only are\nSmith and Jones expected to believe that there is non-zero probability\nthat they will be interacting in a thousand years, each is expected to\nbe able to compute the precise day on which future interactions will\nbecome and remain so unlikely that their expected future return is\noutweighed by that day's payoff. Furthermore each is expected to\nbelieve that the other has made this computation, and that the other\nexpects him to have made it, and so on.\nAxelrod and Tit for Tat\n\nThe iterated version of the PD was discussed from the time the game\nwas devised, but interest accelerated after influential publications\nof Robert Axelrod in the early eighties. Axelrod invited professional\ngame theorists to submit computer programs for playing IPDs. All the\nprograms were entered into a tournament in which each played every\nother (as well as a clone of itself and a strategy that cooperated and\ndefected at random) hundreds of times. It is easy to see that in a\ngame like this no strategy is \u201cbest\u201d in the sense that its\nscore would be highest among any group of competitors. If the other\nstrategies never consider the previous history of interaction in\nchoosing their next move, it would be best to defect unconditionally.\nIf the other strategies all begin by cooperating and then\n\u201cpunish\u201d any defection against themselves by defecting on\nall subsequent rounds, then a policy of unconditional cooperation is\nbetter. Nevertheless, as in the transparent game, some strategies have\nfeatures that seem to allow them to do well in a variety of\nenvironments. The strategy that scored highest in Axelrod's initial\ntournament, Tit for Tat (henceforth TFT), simply\ncooperates on the first round and imitates its opponent's previous\nmove thereafter. More significant than TFT's initial\nvictory, perhaps, is the fact that it won Axelrod's second tournament,\nwhose sixty three entrants were all given the results of the first\ntournament. In analyzing the his second tournament, Axelrod noted that\neach of the entrants could be assigned one of five\n\u201crepresentative\u201d strategies in such a way that a\nstrategy's success against a set of others can be accurately predicted\nby its success against their representative. As a further\ndemonstration of the strength of TFT, he calculated\nthe scores each strategy would have received in tournaments in which\none of the representative strategies was five times as common as in\nthe original tournament. TFT received the highest\nscore in all but one of these hypothetical tournaments.\n\nAxelrod attributed the success of TFT to four\nproperties. It is nice, meaning that it is never the first to\ndefect. The eight nice entries in Axelrod's tournament were the eight\nhighest ranking strategies. It is retaliatory, making it\ndifficult for it to be exploited by the rules that were not nice. It\nis forgiving, in the sense of being willing to cooperate even\nwith those who have defected against it (provided their defection\nwasn't in the immediately preceding round). An unforgiving rule is\nincapable of ever getting the reward payoff after its opponent has\ndefected once. And it is clear, presumably making it easier\nfor other strategies to predict its behavior so as to facilitate\nmutually beneficial interaction.\n\nSuggestive as Axelrod's discussion is, it is worth noting that the\nideas are not formulated precisely enough to permit a rigorous\ndemonstration of the supremacy of TFT. One doesn't\nknow, for example, the extent of the class of strategies that might\nhave the four properties outlined, or what success criteria might be\nimplied by having them. It is true that if one's opponent is playing\nTFT (and the shadow of the future is sufficiently\nlarge) then one's maximum payoff is obtained by a strategy that\nresults in mutual cooperation on every round. Since\nTFT is itself one such strategy this implies that\nTFT forms a nash equilibrium with itself in the space\nof all strategies. But that does not particularly distinguish\nTFT, for \\(\\bDu\\), \\(\\bDu\\) is also a nash\nequilibrium. Indeed, a \u201cfolk theorem\u201d of iterated game\ntheory (now widely published \u2014 see, for example, Binmore 1992,\npp. 373\u2013377) implies that, for any \\(p\\), \\(0 \\le p \\le 1\\)\nthere is a nash equilibrium in which \\(p\\) is the fraction of times\nthat mutual cooperation occurs. Indeed TFT is, in\nsome respects, worse than many of these other equilibrium\nstrategies, because the folk theorem can be sharpened to a similar\nresult about subgame perfect equilibria. TFT is, in\ngeneral, not subgame perfect. For, were one\nTFT player (per impossible) to defect\nagainst another in a single round, the second would have done better\nas an unconditional cooperator.\nPost-Axelrod\n\nAfter publication of Axelrod, 1984, a number of strategies commonly\nthought to improve on TFT were identified. (Since\nsuccess in an IPD tournament depends on the other stragies present, it\nis not clear exactly what this claim means or how it might be\ndemonstrated.) The first of these was Nowak and Sigmond's\nPavlov, also known as, Win-Stay\nLose-Shift (WSLS), which conditions each\nnon-initial move on its own previous move as well as its opponent's.\nMore specifically, it cooperates if it and its opponent previously\nmoved alike and it defects if they previously moved differently.\nEquivalently, it repeats its move after success (temptation or reward)\nand changes it after failure (punishment or sucker). Hence the names.\nThis strategy does well in environments like that of Axelrod's\ntournment, but poorly when many unconditional defectors or random\nplayers are present. It is discussed further under the label \\(\\bP_1\\)\nin the sections on error and evolution below. A second family of these\nis Gradual Tit for Tat (henceforth\nGrdTFT). GrdTFT differs from\nTFT in two respects. First, it gradually increases\nthe string of punishing defection responses to each defection by its\nopponent. Second, it apologizes for each string of defections by\ncooperating in the subsequent two rounds. The first property ensures\nthat (unlike TFT) it will defect with increasing\nfrequency against a random player. The second ensures that (unlike\nTFT) it will quickly establish a regime of mutual\ncooperation with suspicious versions of TFT (i.e.,\nversions of TFT that defect on their first move).\nBeaufils et al show that the version of GrdTFT in\nwhich the string of defections is increased by one each time it is\nexploited wins round robin tournaments populated by a selection of\n\u201cgood\u201d IPD strategies (including TFT)\nthat the authors chose after an examination of previous tournaments.\nTzafestas (1998) argues that, in making a each move depend on the\nentire prior history of the game, GrdTFT incorporates\nundesirable memory requirements. She suggests that equal success might\nbe obtained with an \"adaptive\" strategy, that tracks a measure of the\nopponent's cooperativeness or responsiveness across a narrow window of\nrecent moves and chooses its move according to whether this measure\n(the \"world\") exceeds some threshold. The critique seems misguided:\nmaintaining a count of prior defections seems no more burdensome than\nupdating the world variable. Nevertheless Tzafestas is able to show\nthat one of the strategies she identifies outperforms both\nTFT and GrdTFT in the very same\nenvironment that Beaufils had constructed.\n\nIn more recent years enthusiasm about TFT has been\ntempered by increasing skepticism.(See, for example, Binmore 2015 (p.\n30) and Northcott and Alexandrova (pp. 71-78). Evidence has emerged\nthat the striking success of TFT in Axelrod's\ntournaments may be partly due to features particular to Axelrod's\nsetup. Rapoport et al (2015) suggest that, instead of conducting a\nround-robin tournament in which every strategy plays every strategy,\none might divide the initial population of stratgies randomly into\nequal-size groups, conduct round-robin tournaments within each group.\nand then a championship round-robin tournament among the group\nwinners. They find that, with the same initial population of\nstrategies present in Axelrod's first tournament, the strategies\nranked two and six in that tournament both perform considerably better\nthan top-ranked TFT. Kretz (2011) finds that, in\nround-robin tournaments among populations of strategies that can only\ncondition on a small number of prior moves (of which\nTFT is clearly one) relative performance of\nstrategies is sensitive to the payoff values in the PD matrix. (Interestingly,\nthis is so even if the PDs all satisfy or fail to satisfy the condition\nR+P=T+S, characterizing exchange games, and if they all satisfy or fail to satisfy\nthe RCA condition, R>\u00bd(T+S).\n \n\nEqually telling, perhaps, are the results of a more recent tournament\nusing the same paramters as Axelrod did. To mark the twentieth\nanniversary of the publication of Axelrod's book, a number of similar\ntournaments were staged at the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computing\nin Portland in 2004 and the IEEE Symposium on Computational\nIntelligence and Games in Colchester 2005. Kendall et al 2007\ndescribes the tournaments and contains several papers by authors who\nsubmitted winning entries. Most of the tournaments were deliberately\ndesigned to differ significantly from Axelrod's (and some of these are\nbriefly discussed in the section on signaling below). In the one that most closely replicated Axelrod's tournaments. however,\nTFT finished only fourteenth out of the fifty\nstrategies submitted.\n\nOf Axelrod's five suggested success criteria, the one that seems most\nclearly undermined by the later tournament is\n\u201cclarity\u201d.\u00a0 Neither of the two highest-scoring\nstrategies, Adaptive Pavlov\n(APavlov) and Omega Tit for Tat\n(\u03a9TFT, have near the simplicity of Rapoport's\ntit-for-tat. Both are broadly adaptive in the sense of Tzafestas, but\nthe first is more narrowly crafted than Tzafestas's for what its\ndesigner expected the tournament environment to be, and the second\nreplaces Tzafestas's world variable with a pair of measures intended\nto measure \"deadlock\" and randomness.\n\nLi (2007) says explicitly that the idea behind\nAPavlov was to make an educated guess about what\nstrategies would be entered, find an accurate, low-cost way to\nidentify each during the initial stages of the game and then play an\noptimal strategy against each strategy so identified. For example, the\nstrategies Cu, Du,\nGRIM, RANDOM, TFT,\nTFTT, TTFT, and\nP1, described in a\n supplementary table,\n had all appeared in previous tournaments. By defecting in round one,\ncooperating in round three, and choosing the opposite of one's\nopponent's round-one move in round two, one could identify any\nopposing strategy from among these nine in three moves. This\nidentification process would be costly, however, because, by its first\nmove, it eliminates any opportunity of cooperation with\nGRIM. Li chooses instead to employ\nTFT over the first six rounds as his identifying\nstrategy, reducing cost at the expense of accuracy and range. It is\nworth noting that TFT cannot distinguish any pair of\nstrategies that satisfy Axelrod's niceness condition (never being the\nfirst to defect). This means that it forgoes the chance to exploit\nunconditional cooperators. Li's entry won its tournament only because\nhe guessed correctly that not many unconditional cooperators would be\npresent. The lesson again is to remember that success depends on\nenvironment.\n\n\u03a9TFT plays TFT unless its\nmeasures of deadlock or randomness exceed specified thresholds.\u00a0\nThe deadlock measure is intended to check whether\n\u03a9TFT and its opponent are locked into an\nunproductive cycle in which they take turns defecting.\u00a0 When its\nthreshold is exceeded the strategy cooperates and resets the\nmeasure.\u00a0 When the randomness measure exceeds its threshold\n\u03a9TFT switches to unconditional defection.\u00a0\nContrary to what might be expected by its name, randomness grows when\nOmegaTFT is repeatedly exploited by an unconditional defector.\u00a0\nLike APavlov, however, the strategy cooperates with\nan unconditional cooperator. Details can be found in Slany and\nKienreich (p. 184).\n\nAll the strategies for IPDs mentioned in this entry are summarized in\nthe Table of Strategies mentioned\nabove.\n",
