But a sounder reading may understand him to hold that\nattaining beatitudo and virtus are more like\nbuilt-in beneficial side-effects of openness to the beatitudo\nof everyone \u2013 that is, of love of neighbor as oneself, according\nto a reasonable order of priorities. What virtue (the state of\ncharacter) is praised for, he says, is its actualizing the good of\nreason(ableness), and reason is good because it enables one to discern\nthings for what they truly are \u2013 and so, in the practical\ndomain, to discern real benefits (bona, opportunities) and\ndirect one\u2019s choices and actions to bringing them about in the\nreal people for whom one thereby makes effective one\u2019s love and\nrespect.\n",
