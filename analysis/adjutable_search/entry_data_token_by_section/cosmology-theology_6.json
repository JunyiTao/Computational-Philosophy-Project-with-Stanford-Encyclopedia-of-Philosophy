    "main_text": "Steady-state theories\n3. Steady-state theories\n\nAristotle\u2019s cosmology belonged to the class of steady-state\ntheories in so far that his universe was changeless and eternal. When\nEinstein in 1917 proposed the first relativistic model of the\nuniverse, he unwittingly pictured a universe which had qualitative\nfeatures in common with Aristotle\u2019s: it was finite in space, but\ninfinite in time. The discovery of the expansion of the universe\nexcluded the steady state from relativistic cosmology, but not from\nother forms of cosmology. Robert Millikan, Nobel laureate and famous\nphysicist, was among those who in the 1930s favored an eternally\nrecurrent universe with a continual creation of matter and energy to\ncounter the increase of entropy. He thought that such an eternal and\nevolving universe revealed the creator\u2019s continual activity and\nexplicitly presented his cosmological view as support for the\ndoctrines of Christianity in general and for the immanence of God in\nparticular.\n\nContrary to the earlier ideas of a steady-state universe, the theory\nthat Fred Hoyle, Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold introduced in 1948\naccepted that the universe is expanding. Conceptually the theory was\nfounded on the \u201cperfect cosmological principle,\u201d that is,\nthe postulate that the universe in its large-scale features is not\nonly spatially but also temporally homogeneous. Although this\nclassical steady-state theory was abandoned in the 1960s because of\nits inability to account for new discoveries (such as the cosmic\nmicrowave background and the redshifts of quasars), it remains an\ninstructive case in the cosmology-theology discussion. Moreover, the\ntheory is not quite dead yet, as some of its characteristic features\nsurvive in the quasi-steady-state cosmology (QSSC) still defended by\nJayant Narlikar and a few other cosmologists. This model does not\nsatisfy the perfect cosmological principle, but it assumes an\nindefinite cosmic time scale during which matter is continually\ncreated. In this respect it is an alternative to the big-bang theory\nand its supposed association with divine creation. In 1994, at a time\nwhen he was developing the QSSC model, Hoyle referred to big-bang\ncosmology as \u201ca form of religious fundamentalism\u201d (Hoyle\n1994, 413). According to the classical steady-state theory, the\nuniverse has expanded for an infinity of time and will continue to do\nso for ever; yet the average density of matter remains constant\nbecause matter, or rather matter-energy, is continually being created\nout of nothing. (In later versions of the theory, matter creation was\nnot ex nihilo.) Both features\u2014the infinite time scale\nand the continuous creation of matter\u2014were controversial and\ncaused concern of a philosophical and also a theological nature.\n\nIt was widely assumed in the 1950s that the steady-state universe was\ncontrary to theism or at least made God superfluous as a creator of\nthe cosmos. After all, how can God have created a universe which has\nexisted in an infinity of time? According to the astronomer, science\npopularizer and non-believer Carl Sagan, \u201cthis is one\nconceivable finding of science that could disprove a\nCreator\u2014because an infinitely old universe would never have been\ncreated\u201d (1997, 265). However, although the argument may seem to\npose a real problem for theism, the theologians were well\nprepared\u2014it had been discussed since the thirteenth century when\nThomas Aquinas suggested that God could indeed have created an\ninfinitely old universe. Moreover, theological responses to an\ninfinitely old universe were far from new, for they had already been\ndeveloped in relation to eternally cyclic models, either in the more\nspeculative versions of the nineteenth century or the relativistic\nmodels that were proposed in the 1930s onwards.\n\nAccording to the Thomistic doctrine of creatio continuans,\nGod causes things to exist in the sense that their existence depends\nwholly on his power. If they were left to themselves they would turn\ninto, or return into, nothingness. From this point of view creation is\nbasically a metaphysical rather than a physical and temporal concept,\nand an eternal yet created universe is perfectly possible.\nInterestingly, the leading steady-state physicist William McCrea was\nalso a devout Christian who argued that cosmology, in whatever form,\nmust necessarily include the postulation of a divine creator. As\ntheologians in the 1950s, both Protestants and Catholics, were quick\nto point out, Hoyle\u2019s eternal universe was not particularly\nheretical, for it was still in need of a creator. Not only did they\nmobilize the old concept of continual divine creation, emphasizing\nthat cosmic creation is primarily about the ontological dependence of\nthe world on God, they also stressed that faith in God has little to\ndo with physical cosmology in whatever of its versions. Erich Mascall,\na priest and philosopher of religion, saw no reason why the\nsteady-state model should cause worry among the faithful. As he said\nin 1956, \u201cThe whole question whether the world had a beginning\nor not is, in the last resort, profoundly unimportant for\ntheology\u201d (Mascall 1956, 155).\n\nViews similar to Mascall\u2019s have been held by many later\ntheologians and Christian philosophers, but not by all. There is\ndisagreement about how solidly based in the Bible the concept of\natemporal continual creation is, and also about the significance of an\nabsolute beginning of the world (for opposite views, see Copan and\nCraig 2004 and May 1994). The view that cosmology is essentially\nirrelevant to Christian belief has not gone uncontested. As Ernan\nMcMullin has pointed out, Christian doctrines are more than\nmetaphysics and codes for moral conduct; they are also cosmic claims\nthat say something about the universe and what it contains of things.\nFor this reason theologians need to pay attention to cosmology in\nparticular and to science in general.\n\nSome Christian scientists and philosophers have seen the continual\ncreation of matter, as posited by the steady-state theory, as a\nmanifestation of perpetual divine creation. Thus, the Catholic\nphilosopher Philip Quinn (1993) adopted the old notion of creatio\ncontinuans to the case of steady-state cosmology. The argument is\nessentially that since ex nihilo creation of matter violates\nenergy conservation, there must be an external creative cause that\naccounts for the violation, and this cause he identifies with\nperpetual divine creation. This kind of reasoning has been severely\ncriticized by Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum, who flatly dismisses the claim that\nunderlies the idea of perpetual divine creation, namely that\nnothingness is the natural state of the universe. This claim has also\nbeen argued in detail by Richard Swinburne (1996), who finds it\nextraordinary that there exists anything at all and from the fact that\nsomething exists infers the existence of God. But according to\nGr\u00fcnbaum there is no room for divine creation in either big-bang\nor steady-state cosmology. \u201cSteady-state cosmology,\u201d he\nconcludes, \u201cis indeed logically incompatible with [the]\nclaim that divine creative intervention is causally necessary for the\nnonconservative popping into existence of new matter in the\nsteady-state universe\u201d (Gr\u00fcnbaum 1996, 529).\n\nWhereas steady-state cosmology is at least problematical from the\npoint of view of traditional theology, it goes well together with the\nideas of process theology or philosophy, where God is seen as\ninteracting creatively and incessantly with natural processes. In a\ngeneral sense, Whitehead\u2019s philosophy is more in harmony with\nthe steady state than the big bang universe. The prominent British\nastronomer Bernard Lovell (1959), a devoted Christian inspired by\nprocess thinking, was in sympathy with the steady-state theory and saw\nno reason why it should be a threat to belief in a divine being. To\nhim, the creation of matter was a sure sign of God\u2019s\nactivity.\n",
