    "main_text": "The Human Genome Project: From Genomics to Postgenomics || Aftermath\n1.3 Aftermath\n\nPublic support was won for the HGP through scientists\u2019 promises\nof the revolutionary benefits of genome-based research for\npharmaceutical and other biomedical applications. At the outset of the\nHGP, these promises were sometimes alarmingly deterministic,\nreductionistic, and overblown, such as when Science editor\nDaniel Koshland (1989) submitted that genes are responsible not only\nfor manic-depression and schizophrenia but also poverty and\nhomelessness, and that sequencing the genome represented \u201ca\ngreat new technology to aid the poor, the infirm, and the\nunderprivileged\u201d (p. 189). More circumspect claims by\nscientist-proponents of the HGP were no less optimistic. Leroy Hood\nexpressed the belief that \u201cwe will learn more about human\ndevelopment and pathology in the next twenty-five years than we have\nin the past two thousand\u201d (1992, p. 163). Hood expected the HGP\nto facilitate movement from a reactive to preventive mode of medicine,\nwhich would \u201cenable most individuals to live a normal, healthy,\nand intellectually alert life without disease\u201d (p. 158). Francis\nCollins predicted that sequencing the genome would \u201cdramatically\naccelerate the development of new strategies for the diagnosis,\nprevention, and treatment of disease, not just for single-gene\ndisorders but for the host of more common complex diseases (e.g.,\ndiabetes, heart disease, schizophrenia, and cancer)\u201d (1999, p.\n29). Collins envisioned that, by 2010, genetically-based\n\u201cindividualized medicine\u201d would be a reality: physicians\nwould routinely take cheek swabs from patients and send their DNA out\nfor testing; based on results of genetic testing (returned within a\nweek), physicians would be able to advise their patients about their\nabsolute and relative risks for contracting various adult-onset\ndiseases; by taking preventive measures (e.g., quitting smoking,\nhaving an annual colonoscopy, etc.), patients would be able to prevent\nthe onset of any such diseases or minimize their effects; and the\nfield of pharmacogenomics would have \u201cblossomed\u201d\nsufficiently for physicians to be able to prescribe prophylactic\nmedications tailored precisely to the genetic make-up of their\npatients, so to promote efficacy and prevent adverse reactions.\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS), in which single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome are compared in\ncase\u2013control fashion, are the main approach used to investigate\nthe genetic bases of complex traits. The importance of developing\nrapid, inexpensive methods of genome sequencing and building a\ndatabase of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to support the\ninvestigation of complex traits was recognized by the project\u2019s\nleadership even before completion of the HGP. Worried about the\nprivate sector\u2019s efforts to patent SNPs, which would make them\ncostly to use for research, the NHGRI-DOE\u2019s five-year plan for\n1998\u20132003 included the goal of mapping 100,000 SNPs by 2003\n(Collins et al. 1998). The development of a public database of SNPs\nreceived a $138 million push from the International HapMap Project, a\nthree-year public-private partnership completed in 2005 that mapped\nvariation in four population groups (The International HapMap\nConsortium 2005). The 1000 Genomes Project, which ran between 2008 and\n2015 (Birney and Soranzo 2015), sought to identify genetic variants\nthat occur with a frequency of at least one percent in the populations\nstudied, with the final data set consisting of 2,504 individuals from\n26 populations from five continental regions.\n\nThe first genome-wide association study was published in 2005; by\n2010, 500 genome-wide association studies had been published (Green et\nal. 2011); and by 2018, more than 5,000 genome-wide association\nstudies had been published and their results added to the GWAS Catalog\n(Buniello et al. 2019). Despite these efforts, variants isolated by\nGWAS for complex traits account for a low percentage of heritability\nassociated with the traits, a phenomenon known as \u201cmissing\nheritability\u201d (Maher 2008). Although knowledge of the\npathogenesis of common complex diseases such as diabetes, heart\ndisease, schizophrenia, and cancer that arise due to the interaction\nof numerous genetic and nongenetic factors is lacking despite the\nnumerous GWAS completed, the pathogenesis of so-called single-gene\ndisorders is far better understood. Aided by the HGP\u2019s dense map\nof genetic markers for use in positional mapping and subsequent\ndevelopment of genome-wide sequencing technologies, since the draft\nsequence was published 20 years ago, the number of Mendelian diseases\nwith a known genetic basis has increased from 1,257 to 4,377 (Alkuraya\n2021). This progress speeds up clinical diagnosis and facilitates\nprenatal genetic testing. Prevention and treatment remain challenging,\nhowever. There are only 59 \u201cactionable genes\u201d on the\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\u2019 most recent\nlist of genes that are highly penetrant and associated with\nestablished interventions (Kalia et al. 2017). Gene therapy, touted as\na potential cure for such disorders, yielded discouraging results in\ntrials; only with the discovery of CRISPR, a novel technology of gene\nediting, has optimism been restored, though how well this basic\nscience translates into clinical applications is yet to be seen\n(Doudna and Sternberg 2017; Baylis 2019).\n\nThe confident claims of leading genome scientists such as Hood and\nCollins proved to be overly so. Commentary at the time of the 10-year\nanniversary of completion of the HGP showed unison among scientists in\nrecognizing that the promised revolution had not yet arrived. The HGP\nhas been advanced as a case study in support of the \u201csocial\nbubble\u201d hypothesis: the hypothesis that people will dive into\nnew opportunities that present without due regard for potential risks\nbecause they are carried along by social interactions driven by\nenthusiasts who generate high expectations of returns\u2014for the\nHGP, projections of commercially lucrative pharmaceutical and other\nbiomedical applications advanced by project proponents (Gisler et al.\n2010). The scientific consensus appears to be that although the HGP\nfailed at least in the short term to fulfill proponents\u2019 overly\noptimistic prognostications for clinical applications, it has been a\nboon for basic science (Evans 2010). In the HGP\u2019s early years,\nNorton Zinder, who chaired the NIH\u2019s Program Advisory Committee\non the Human Genome, characterized it in this way: \u201cThis Project\nis creating an infrastructure for doing science; it\u2019s not the\ndoing of the science per se. It will provide the biological community\nwith the basic materials for doing research in human biology\u201d\n(in Cooper 1994, p. 74).\n\nIndeed, the infrastructure of mapping and sequencing technologies and\nbioinformatics that was developed as part of the HGP\u2014especially\nthe ability to sequence entire genomes of organisms and traffic in big\ndata\u2014has changed the way biology, not just human biology, is\ndone (Stevens 2013). It is recognized that genome structure by itself\ntells us only so much. Functional genomics places interest in how\nentire genomes\u2014not just individual genes\u2014function. A\nsurprising discovery of the HGP was that the number of coding genes in\nhumans is many orders smaller than what scientists had assumed at the\noutset of the project\u2014that is, around 20,000, as in other\nvertebrates, rather than 80,000\u2013100,000, though the final number\nremains an open question (Salzberg 2018). The majority of the\ngenome\u2019s DNA is transcribed but not translated and serves a\nregulatory function, with causal processes at the molecular level\nassociated with interactive networks not linear pathways. The\ndeterministic and reductionistic assumptions underlying the HGP that\nportrayed the genome as a blueprint for organismal development have\nbeen undermined by the research in molecular biology the project made\npossible (Keller 2000). Systems biology has emerged as a new\ndiscipline that seeks to understand this complexity by using\ncomputational methods (Hood 2003). In fact, since completion of the\nHGP, discovery of non-protein-coding elements of the genome and their\ncontributions to regulatory networks has far exceeded the discovery of\nprotein-coding genes (Gates et al. 2021). Evolutionary studies are\naided by the ability of scientists to compare the human genome\nreference sequence to reference sequences for close relatives, such as\nNeandertals (Green et al. 2010), bonobos (Mao et al. 2021), and\nchimpanzees (The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium\n2005).\n\nFor scientists to deliver on their promises for a revolution in\nmedicine, genome sequencing would need to be far faster, easier, and\ncheaper for its use to become routine in both research and clinical\nsettings. In the closing years of the HGP, the cost of sequencing a\nhuman genome using existing Sanger technology was about $100 million.\nWith high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology, in 2007,\nVenter\u2019s diploid genome was sequenced at a cost of $10 million,\nand by 2013, the cost of sequencing an average genome had been lowered\nto $5,000. These developments were aided by a NHGRI grant program that\nset its sights on a $1,000 genome, a price point believed to place the\n\u201cpersonal genome\u201d within reach for routine use (Check\nHayden 2014). Early in 2014, Illumina, a Californian company, claimed\na win in the contest, with availability of its HiSeq X Ten system for\npopulation-scale whole-genome sequencing initiatives (Sheridan 2014);\nin March 2016, Veritas Genetics, a company cofounded by Harvard\nmedical geneticist George M. Church, announced commercial availability\nof whole-genome sequencing for individuals, including interpretation\nand counseling, for $999 (Veritas Genetics 2016). Church had initiated\nthe Personal Genome Project in 2005 (Church 2005); there are now\nPersonal Genome Projects in Canada, the U.K., Austria, and China as\nwell. The projects recruit volunteers who are willing to support\nresearch by releasing their genomes and health and physical\ninformation publicly. Research that takes this longitudinal approach\ncombining genetic and clinical data is considered crucial for the\npromise of genomics to be fulfilled: with faster, easier, and cheaper\ngenome sequencing technologies, genetic data are readily obtainable,\nbut analysis of the data, without which there can be no revolution in\nmedicine, remains challenging.\n\nThe National Research Council\u2019s 2011 report saw the route to\n\u201cpersonalized medicine,\u201d or \u201cprecision\nmedicine\u201d as it was renamed (see Juengst et al. 2016 and\nFerryman and Pitcan 2018 for an account of that change), proceeding\nvia a \u201cNew Taxonomy\u201d of disease informed by two data\nrepositories: an \u201cInformation Commons\u201d that stores\nmolecular data (genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, lipidome,\nand epigenome) and additional information (phenotypes, treatment\noutcomes, test results, etc.) gleaned from the electronic health\nrecords of millions of individuals; and a \u201cKnowledge Network of\nDisease\u201d that integrates this information with\n\u201cfundamental biological knowledge.\u201d Disease\ngeneralizations would be \u201cbuilt up from\u201d this large number\nof individuals, a departure from studies that group individuals based\non particular characteristics (e.g., GWAS). Research efforts\napproaching the scale called for include the All of Us\nResearch Program in the U.S. and the UK Biobank. The data-intensive\napproach to molecular biology made possible by information technology\nneed not stop at electronic health records but could also include\nother electronic records such as credit card purchases and social\nmedia postings (Weber et al. 2014), and biometric measurements from\nmobile apps and fitness trackers (Shi and Wu 2017). The increased\nimportance of \u201cbig data\u201d is illustrated by contrasting\nfuturistic scenarios envisioned by Collins (1999) and Hood and Rowen\n(2013) almost 15 years apart. The \u201cindividualized\nmedicine\u201d circa 2010 forecasted by Collins is centered in the\nphysician\u2019s office and assumes a traditional view of the\ndoctor\u2013patient relationship. Hood and Rowen foresee individual\ngenome sequences playing a larger role in medical practice and a\nchanged doctor\u2013patient relationship, driven by\n\u201cpatients\u201d who are likely to bring consumer genetic data\nto their appointments and understand themselves to be active\nparticipants in their medical care. The new \u201cP4 medicine\u201d\nwill be not only predictive, preventive, and personalized, but\nparticipatory, and based on a data-driven systems approach to disease.\nWrite Hood and Rowen, \u201cWe envision a time in the future when all\npatients will be surrounded by a virtual cloud of billions of data\npoints, and when we will have the analytical tools to reduce this\nenormous data dimensionality to simple hypotheses to optimize wellness\nand minimize disease for each individual\u201d (p. 83). In the\nmeanwhile, as Jenny Reardon (2017) tells us, the vast expanse between\ndata and meaning characterizes \u201cthe postgenomic\ncondition.\u201d\n\nPhysicians are likely to encounter patients who bring consumer genetic\ndata to their appointments because of a development largely\nunanticipated by HGP proponents and critics alike: \u201cpersonal\ngenomics\u201d or \u201crecreational genomics.\u201d Efforts to\ncompile SNP databases and develop rapid, inexpensive, whole-genome\nsequencing technologies have not yet supported the dawn of a new era\nof personalized medicine and drug development guided by\npharmacogenomics, but direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomics has taken off\nas an industry, with profit-making seemingly unhampered by the lack of\ntreatments for diseases based on knowledge of DNA sequences. The first\nDTC whole-genome test was marketed in 2006 (Green at al. 2011). By\n2018, more than 10 million people had ordered DTC personal genomics\ntests (Khan and Mittelman 2018), and, that year, the NHGRI,\ncelebrating the HGP\u2019s 15th anniversary, identified\nDTC genetic testing as one of the \u201c15 for 15\u201d ways in\nwhich genomics is influencing the world. In 2019, the global DTC\ngenetic testing market was valued at over $1 billion and forecast to\nclimb to $3.4 billion by 2028 (Ugalmugle and Swain 2020). Although\nhealth and ancestry are the most common genetic tests sought, there is\na broad range of tests available, and DTC companies usually offer more\nthan one service (Phillips 2016). 23andMe and Ancestry.com, for\nexample, offer both health and ancestry tests. The family match\nfunction offered by these tests allows biological parentage to be\ndiscovered in cases of adoption and gamete donorship/sale. For people\nwho want to confirm paternity, out a cheating spouse, ascertain\nathletic ability, identify nutritional needs, or find a romantic\npartner, there are genetic tests and companies for those interests\ntoo.\n",
