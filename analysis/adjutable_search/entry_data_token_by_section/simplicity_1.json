Ontological Parsimony\n\nPerhaps the most common formulation of the ontological form of Occam\u2019s\nRazor is the following:\n\n(OR)\nEntities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity.\n\n\nIt should be noted that modern formulations of Occam\u2019s Razor are\nconnected only very tenuously to the 14th-century figure\nWilliam of Ockham. We are not here interested in the exegetical\nquestion of how Ockham intended his \u2018Razor\u2019 to function,\nnor in the uses to which it was put in the context of medieval\n metaphysics.[4]\n Contemporary philosophers have tended to reinterpret OR as a\nprinciple of theory choice: OR implies that\u2014other things being\nequal\u2014it is rational to prefer theories which commit us to\nsmaller ontologies. This suggests the following paraphrase of OR:\n\n(OR1)\nOther things being equal, if \\(T_1\\) is more\nontologically parsimonious than \\(T_2\\) then it is\nrational to prefer \\(T_1\\) to \\(T_2\\).\n\n\nWhat does it mean to say that one theory is more ontologically\nparsimonious than another? The basic notion of ontological parsimony\nis quite straightforward, and is standardly cashed out in terms of\nQuine\u2019s concept of ontological commitment. A theory,\n\\(T\\), is ontologically committed to \\(F\\)s if and only if\n\\(T\\) entails that \\(F\\)\u2019s exist (Quine 1981, pp.\n144\u20134). If two theories, \\(T_1\\) and\n\\(T_2\\), have the same ontological commitments except\nthat \\(T_2\\) is ontologically committed to \\(F\\)s\nand \\(T_1\\) is not, then \\(T_1\\) is more\nparsimonious than \\(T_2\\). More generally, a sufficient\ncondition for \\(T_1\\) being more parsimonious than\n\\(T_2\\) is for the ontological commitments of\n\\(T_1\\) to be a proper subset of those of\n\\(T_2\\). Note that OR1 is considerably\nweaker than the informal version of Occam\u2019s Razor, OR, with which we\nstarted. OR stipulates only that entities should not be multiplied\nbeyond necessity. OR1, by contrast, states that\nentities should not be multiplied other things being equal,\nand this is compatible with parsimony being a comparatively weak\ntheoretical virtue.\n\nOne \u2018easy\u2019 case where OR1 can be\nstraightforwardly applied is when a theory, \\(T\\), postulates\nentities which are explanatorily idle. Excising these entities from\n\\(T\\) produces a second theory, \\(T^*\\), which has the same\ntheoretical virtues as \\(T\\) but a smaller set of ontological\ncommitments. Hence, according to OR1, it is rational to\npick \\(T^*\\) over \\(T\\). (As previously noted, terminology\nsuch as \u2018pick\u2019 and \u2018prefer\u2019 is crucially\nambiguous between epistemic and methodological versions of Occam\u2019s\nRazor. For the purposes of defining ontological parsimony, it is not\nnecessary to resolve this ambiguity.) However, such cases are\npresumably rare, and this points to a more general worry concerning\nthe narrowness of application of OR1. First, how often does\nit actually happen that we have two (or more) competing theories for\nwhich \u2018other things are equal\u2019? As biologist Kent\nHolsinger remarks,\n\nSince Occam\u2019s Razor ought to be invoked only when several hypotheses\nexplain the same set of facts equally well, in practice its domain\nwill be very limited\u2026[C]ases where competing hypotheses explain\na phenomenon equally well are comparatively rare (Holsinger 1980, pp.\n144\u20135).\n\n\nSecond, how often are one candidate theory\u2019s ontological commitments a\nproper subset of another\u2019s? Much more common are situations where\nontologies of competing theories overlap, but each theory has\npostulates which are not made by the other. Straightforward\ncomparisons of ontological parsimony are not possible in such\ncases.\n\nBefore setting aside the definitional question for ontological\nparsimony, one further distinction should be mentioned. This\ndistinction is between qualitative parsimony (roughly, the\nnumber of types (or kinds) of thing postulated) and\nquantitative parsimony (roughly, the number of individual\nthings\n postulated).[5]\n The default reading of Occam\u2019s Razor in the bulk of the philosophical\nliterature is as a principle of qualitative parsimony. Thus Cartesian\ndualism, for example, is less qualitatively parsimonious than\nmaterialism because it is committed to two broad kinds of entity\n(mental and physical) rather than one. Section 6.1 contains a brief\ndiscussion of quantitative parsimony; apart from this the focus will\nbe on the qualitative notion. It should be noted that interpreting\nOccam\u2019s Razor in terms of kinds of entity brings with it some\nextra philosophical baggage of its own. In particular, judgments of\nparsimony become dependent on how the world is sliced up into kinds.\nNor is guidance from extra-philosophical usage\u2014and in particular\nfrom science\u2014always clearcut. For example, is a previously\nundiscovered subatomic particle made up of a novel rearrangement of\nalready discovered sub-particles a new \u2018kind\u2019? What about\na biological species, which presumably does not contain any novel\nbasic constituents? Also, ought more weight to be given to broad and\nseemingly fundamental divisions of kind\u2014for example between the\nmental and physical\u2014than between more parochial divisions?\nIntuitively, the postulation of a new kind of matter would seem to\nrequire much more extensive and solid justification than the\npostulation of a new sub-species of\n spider.[6]\n\nThe third and final question from Section 1 concerns potential\njustifications for principles of ontological parsimony such as Occam\u2019s\nRazor. The demand for justification of such principles can be\nunderstood in two importantly distinct ways, corresponding to the\ndistinction between epistemic principles and methodological principles\nmade at the end of Section 1. Justifying an epistemic principle\nrequires answering an epistemic question: why are parsimonious\ntheories more likely to be true? Justifying a methodological principle\nrequires answering a pragmatic question: why does it make practical\nsense for theorists to adopt parsimonious\n theories?[7]\n Most attention in the literature has centered on the first, epistemic\nquestion. It is easy to see how syntactic elegance in a theory can\nbring with it pragmatic advantages such as being more perspicuous,\nbeing easier to use and manipulate, and so on. But the case is more\ndifficult to make for ontological\n parsimony.[8]\n It is unclear what particular pragmatic disadvantages accrue to\ntheories which postulate extra kinds of entities; indeed\u2014as was\nmentioned in the previous section\u2014such postulations can often\nbring with them striking syntactic simplification.\n\nBefore looking at approaches to answering the epistemic justification\nquestion, mention should be made of two positions in the literature\nwhich do not fall squarely into either the pragmatic or epistemic\ncamp. The first position, associated primarily with Quine, argues that\nparsimony carries with it pragmatic advantages and that pragmatic\nconsiderations themselves provide rational grounds for discriminating\nbetween competing theories (Quine 1966, Walsh 1979). The Quinean\nposition bases an answer to the second question on the answer to the\nfirst, thus blurring the boundary between pragmatic and epistemic\njustification. The second position, due to Sober, rejects the implicit\nassumption in both the above questions that some global justification\nof parsimony can be found (Sober 1988, 1994). Instead Sober argues\nthat appeals to parsimony always depend on local background\nassumptions for their rational justification. Thus Sober writes:\n\nThe legitimacy of parsimony stands or falls, in a particular research\ncontext, on subject matter specific (and a posteriori)\nconsiderations. [\u2026] What makes parsimony reasonable in one\ncontext may have nothing in common with why it matters in another\n(Sober 1994).\n\n\nPhilosophers who reject these arguments of Quine and Sober, and thus\ntake the demand for a global, epistemic justification seriously, have\ndeveloped a variety of approaches to justifying parsimony. Most of\nthese approaches can be collected under two broad headings:\n\n(A)\nA priori philosophical, metaphysical, or theological\njustifications.\n(B)\nNaturalistic justifications, based on appeal to scientific\npractice.\n\n\nAs we shall see, the contrast between these two sorts of approach\nmirrors a broader divide between the rival traditions of rationalism\nand empiricism in philosophy as a whole.\n\nAs well as parsimony, the question of rational justification can also\nbe raised for principles based on elegance, the second facet of\nsimplicity distinguished in Section 1. Approaches to justifying\nelegance along the lines of (A) and (B) are possible, but much of the\nrecent work falls under a third category;\n\n(C)\nJustifications based on results from probability theory and/or\nstatistics.\n\n\nThe next three sections examine these three modes of justification of\nsimplicity principles. The a priori justifications in\ncategory (A) concern simplicity in both its parsimony and elegance\nforms. The justifications falling under category (B) pertain mostly to\nparsimony, while those falling under category (C) pertain mostly to\nelegance.\n",
