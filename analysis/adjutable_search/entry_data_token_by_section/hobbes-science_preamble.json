    "main_text": "\n\nThomas Hobbes is rightly regarded as a monumental figure in the\nhistory of philosophy, especially for his masterpiece\nLeviathan (1651 in English; 1668 in Latin). The scholarly\nliterature on Leviathan is voluminous and has been especially\nfocused upon issues in political philosophy, such as representation\nand authorization, sovereignty and absolutism, contracts and\ncovenants, and the relationship of civil authority to religion, among\nothers. Since its printing the portrayal in Leviathan XIII of\nhumans in their natural state\u2014an existence that is\n\u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u201d\u2014has\nstruck the imagination of many of Hobbes\u2019 readers, leaving many\nseeing Hobbes as pessimistic at best or hopelessly unrealistic at\nworst.\n\nIn Hobbes\u2019 own time, however, he was also well-known, even if\nsometimes ridiculed, for his views in mathematics, natural philosophy,\nand optics. In A Minute or First Draught of the Optiques\n(1646), Hobbes\u2019 own assessment of his work is laudatory:\n\n\n\u2026I shall deserve the Reputation of having been the first to lay\nthe ground of two Sciences, this of Opticques, the most curious, and\nthat other of natural Justice, which I have done in my book de Cive,\nthe most profitable of all other. (Hobbes 1646 [1983: 622])\n\n\nAlthough some contemporaries saw promise in Hobbes\u2019 optics, such\nas Mersenne, who published Hobbes\u2019 work in this area in 1644 in\nBallistica, in the years following the publication of\nLeviathan Hobbes\u2019 pursuits apart from political\nphilosophy were taken less seriously. There are a number of possible\nexplanations for this decline in the opinion of Hobbes\u2019\ncompetence in these areas, including his numerous attempts to square\nthe circle, the association of his views with atheism by many critics,\nand the conflicts he had with Robert Boyle at the time of the rise of\nexperimental philosophy. These all contributed to some extent to\nHobbes\u2019 exclusion from the Royal Society when it was\nfounded.\n\nIf Hobbes\u2019 mathematical and natural-philosophical endeavors\nfailed to be taken seriously by his contemporaries near the end of his\nlife, what purpose is served by understanding these failed\n attempts?[1]\n Apart from interest in them on their own terms as episodes in the\nhistory of science and philosophy, there are several reasons why we\nmay find these areas of Hobbes\u2019 thought valuable for study.\nFirst, Hobbes himself understood his political philosophy, or as he\ncalled it \u201ccivil philosophy\u201d, to be a science capable of\ndemonstration. Thus, understanding his general views about the nature\nof scientific demonstration promises to shed light on the way in which\nhe saw civil philosophy as scientific. Second, Hobbes understood\nnatural-philosophical explanations in physics as needing to make use\nof mathematical principles to count, as he says, as \u201ctrue\nphysics\u201d and to be useful for improving humans\u2019 quality of\nlife. This claim about the use of mathematics to explain natural\nphenomena may seem banal to a twenty-first century reader, but it was\nnot so to many in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\nHobbes\u2019 natural philosophy thus situates him within the shift\nfrom qualitative to quantitative physics. Third, Hobbes\u2019\nconflicts with the Royal Society show us not only his views of the\nrole of experimentation but also contextualize the rise of\nexperimentalism. After discussing Hobbes\u2019 criteria for\nscientific knowledge, this entry will address each of these areas.\n",
