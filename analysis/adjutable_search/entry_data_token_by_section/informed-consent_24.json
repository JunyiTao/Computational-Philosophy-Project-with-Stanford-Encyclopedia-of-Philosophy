Just like being informed, the voluntariness of choices\ncomes in degrees (Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 101). Threats, for\nexample, control us to different degrees, depending on the degree of\nharm being threatened (Beauchamp 2010, 70\u20131). The level of\nvoluntariness necessary for valid consent to medical intervention may\nvary according to the type of intervention offered. So does the level\nof decision-making capacity necessary for valid consent (Buchanan and\nBrock 1989, ch. 1; Beauchamp 2010, 71). Robust informed consent that\nrequires a great deal of information, voluntariness, and decisional\ncapacity and is formalized and relatively non-waiveable, is necessary\nsometimes, but not always. Roughly speaking, robust informed consent\n(Joffe and Truog 2010, 358; Miller 2010, 391; Beauchamp and Childress\n2008, 101; Beauchamp 2010, 70\u20131) tends to be necessary the more\nrisky the intervention, the more it is a high-impact (e.g. a\ndefinitive \u201ccritical life choice\u201d: Archard 2008), the more\nit is value-laden and controversial, the more private the area of the\nbody that the intervention directly affects, and the more conflicted\nand unsupervised the practitioner. On other occasions, the need for\nvery robust informed consent, and indeed, for consent of any form, is\nlesser (Miller 2010, 393). On those occasions, high financial or other\ncosts of robust consent procedures easily override that need.\n\nDoes the need for informed consent depend, among other variables, on\nwhether the consent is for research or for care? Currently, consent\nprocedures for research tend to be more demanding and more regulated\nthan consent procedures for equally intrusive treatment (Levine 1988,\n127\u201330; Miller 2010, 381). Why? A standard account is that the\nproper goal of research is to gather generalizable knowledge, and not\nto help the individual, and that this different goal enhances the need\nfor protections like informed consent (Fried 1974). However, actual\ngoals often differ from proper goals. In reality, many researchers are\nhighly committed to promoting participants\u2019 health, and many\nclinicians seek primarily financial gain, sometimes at patients\u2019\nexpense. In addition, studies are reviewed independently for their\nsafety, making some so safe that (with or without consent) they impose\nless risk than similar clinical care. Another rationale for the fewer\nconsent requirements in care is that the relationship between the\nclinician and the patient is typically a fiduciary one whereas the\nrelationship between the investigator and the study participant is\nscarcely fiduciary (Joffe and Truog 2010, 364). But this rationale\ncould easily work the other way around: assuming that the fiduciary\nrelationship is a ground for informed consent (Joffe and Truog 2010,\n352ff.), the more fiduciary clinical relationship should demand more,\nnot less, by way of informed consent.\n\nLet us return to the general picture of scalar need for informed\nconsent, which depends on many variables and generates different\nrequirements on different occasions. It also raises interesting\npractical questions. First, who should decide when fully informed\nconsent is necessary (Joffe and Truog 2010, 361)? Might a crude,\none-size-fits-all requirement of informed consent serve most practical\npurposes (Wertheimer 2014)? Perhaps a fair compromise is to use an\n\u201cintervention ladder\u201d that defines broad categories of\nintervention as more or less intrusive, then specifies broad\ncategories of circumstance that require especially robust consent in\nsome cases and only minimal consent in others (Nuffield Council on\nBioethics 2007, 41\u20133)? What seems, in any event, to emerge is\nthat the need for informed consent would be misrepresented as\nfundamentally a single constraint or threshold. In this area, at\nleast, commonsense morality acknowledges that prescriptions\u2019\nstrengths and characters vary, with multiple determinants.\n",
