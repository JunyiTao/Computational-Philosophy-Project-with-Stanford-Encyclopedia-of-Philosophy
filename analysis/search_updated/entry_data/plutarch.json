    "preamble": "\n\n\nPlutarch of Chaeronea in Boeotia (ca. 45\u2013120 CE) was a\nPlatonist philosopher, best known to the general public as author of\nhis \u201cParallel Lives\u201d of paired Greek and Roman statesmen\nand military leaders. He was a voluminous writer, author also of a\ncollection of \u201cMoralia\u201d or \u201cEthical Essays,\u201d\nmostly in dialogue format, many of them devoted to philosophical\ntopics, not at all limited to ethics.\n\n\nPlutarch's significance as a philosopher, on which this article\nconcentrates, lies in his attempt to do justice to Plato's work as a\nwhole, and to create a coherent and credible philosophical system out\nof it, as Plotinus will also do later (204\u2013270 CE). Two moves\nare crucial in this regard. First, Plutarch respects both the\nskeptical/aporetic element in Plato (as marked by the tentativeness\nwith which Socrates and the other main speakers in his dialogues\nregularly advance their views) and the views apparently endorsed by\nthe main speakers of the dialogues, which were widely regarded as\nPlato's own doctrines (e.g. Diogenes Laertius 3.51\u20132). Second,\nPlutarch focuses primarily and quite strongly on the Timaeus\nfor his understanding of Plato's \u201cdoctrines,\u201d and his\ninterpretation of this dialogue shapes his understanding of the entire\nPlato. Plutarch maintains a literal interpretation of the\nTimaeus, according to which the world has come about in time\nfrom two principles, the creator god and the \u201cIndefinite\nDyad\u201d. While the Dyad accounts for disorder and multiplicity,\nsuch as that of disordered matter before the creation of the ordered\nphysical world, of which pre-cosmic stage Timaeus appears to speak in\nthe Timaeus, god accounts for order and the nature and\nidentity of objects and properties in the world.\nThis metaphysical dualism is further strengthened by the assumption\nof two mediating entities through which the two principles operate;\nthe Indefinite Dyad operates through a non-rational cosmic soul, while\ngod through a rational one. This is the same soul, which becomes\nrational when god imparts reason from himself to it. As a result of\ngod's imparting reason to the world soul, matter ceases to move in a\ndisorderly manner, being brought into order through the imposition of\nForms on it. The postulation of a non-rational pre-cosmic world soul,\ninspired mainly by Laws X (but absent from the\nTimaeus), allows Plutarch to dissolve the apparent\ncontradiction in different works of Plato that the soul is said to be\nboth uncreated (eternal) and created. For in his view the first soul\nof the sensible world, the world soul, is created only in the sense\nthat god, the demiurge of the Timaeus, makes it rational. The\npostulation of a non-rational pre-cosmic soul also allows Plutarch to\naccount for the existence of badness in the world, because in his view\nresidual irrationality abides in the world soul even when it becomes\nrational, which is accounted for by the fact that the world soul is\noriginally non-rational in the sense that its movement is such,\ni.e. disorderly, and reason is an element external to it.\n This dualism (non-rational-disorderly-bad\nvs. rational-orderly-good) pervades also the sensible or physical\nworld, since the human soul, being derivative from the world soul, has\na rational and a non-rational aspect too, as the Republic\nproposes. In this spirit Plutarch distinguishes both in the world and\nin human beings three aspects, body, soul, and intellect. The soul's\nconcern with the body gives rise to the non-rational aspect, which\namounts to disorder, vice, or badness, while the co-operation between\nsoul and intellect promotes rationality, that is, order, virtue,\nbenevolence. In an attempt to accommodate the diverse strands of\nethical thought in Plato (e.g. in the Gorgias,\nProtagoras, Republic, Phaedo,\nTheaetetus, Timaeus), Plutarch is the first\nPlatonist to distinguish different levels of ethical life, which we\ncould term political and theoretical respectively, depending on\nwhether virtue pertains to the soul as organizing principle for one's\ndaily life, or to the intellect as one's guide to knowledge of the\nForms (which include virtues) and of the intelligible realm more\ngenerally.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and works\n\n\nPlutarch was born in Chaeronea, a city of Boeotia in central Greece\naround 45\u201347 CE. This date is inferred from Plutarch's own\ntestimony (On the E at Delphi 385B), according to which he\nbegan studying at Athens with a Platonist philosopher named Ammonius\n(see Dillon 1977, 189\u2013192, Donini 1986b), when Nero was in\nGreece (66/67 CE). (This assumes that he was not more than twenty\nyears old at the time.) We know little about Ammonius and his school,\nthat is, also of Plutarch's institutional affiliation (the evidence of\nOn the E at Delphi 387F has been much debated; see\ne.g. Donini 1986a, 209\u2013212, 1986b, 108\u2013119, Opsomer 1998,\n21-25, 129-131). The main evidence about Ammonius' philosophical views\nis his speech as a character in On the E at Delphi\n(391E\u2013394C), on god, being, generation and corruption as well as\nhis contributions to the discussion in On the Obsolence of\nOracles (410F\u2013414C) regarding divine justice and providence\n(Dillon 1977, 189\u2013192, Opsomer 2009, 142\u2013179). This\nevidence can be reasonably considered indicative of Ammonius'\nengagement with metaphysics, which must have stimulated Plutarch's own\ninterest in metaphysical questions. Plutarch must have stayed in\nAthens not only during his studies with Ammonius but considerably\nlonger, so as to become an Athenian citizen (Table Talks\n628A). According to this testimony, he also visited Rome\n(Demetrius 2) and Alexandria (Table Talks 678A; see\nRussell 1973, 7\u20138). However, Plutarch spent most of his life in\nhis native city and in nearby Delphi. There must have been two reasons\nfor this; first, Plutarch's strong ties with his family, which\napparently was wealthy enough to support his studies and travels\n(Russell 1973, 3\u20135), and, second, his own interest in the\nreligious activity of Delphi. The latter is testified to by the fact\nthat Plutarch served in various positions in Delphi, including that of\nthe priest of Apollo (Table Talks 700E), and also in his\nseveral works concerning Delphi and the local sacred rituals (On\nthe E at Delphi, On Oracles at Delphi, On the Obsolescence of\nOracles; see Stadter 2005). These works demonstrate intimate\nknowledge of Delphi, its traditions, and activities. Plutarch must\nhave died after 119 CE, the date at which he was appointed procurator\nof Achaea by Hadrian (Eusebius' Chronicle).\n\nPlutarch was a prolific writer. The so-called Lamprias catalogue, an\nancient library catalogue (preserved mutilated), supposedly compiled by\nPlutarch's son Lamprias, lists 227 works, several of them no\nlonger extant (Russell 1973, 18\u201319). Plutarch's works divide into\nphilosophical and historical-biographical. The latter, the so-called\nLives (Bioi) of distinguished Greek and Roman men\nexamined in pairs, demonstrate Plutarch's historical and\nrhetorical abilities, also showing his interest in character formation\nand politics (Russell 1973, 100\u2013116). Plutarch's philosophical\nworks, many of them dialogues (set in Delphi or Chaeronea), cover half\nof his literary output. In modern times they have been published under\nthe collective term Moralia, a term first given to a\ncollection of eleven ethical works preserved in a 14th\ncentury manuscript (Parisinus Graecus 1672). When the collection was\naugmented by many other writings preserved in other manuscripts on\ntopics ranging from metaphysics, psychology, natural philosophy,\ntheology, logic, to philosophy of art, the name was retained with the\nmisleading implication that Plutarch's philosophical works are\nessentially or primarily ethical.\n\nAmong Plutarch's works, several serve polemical purposes. He wrote a\nnumber of works against the Stoic and Epicurean philosophies.  Against\nthe Stoics are mainly the works On the Self-contradictions of the\nStoics (De stoicorum repugnantiis), On the Common\nNotions against the Stoics (De communibus notitiis),\nOn the Cleverness of Animals (De sollertia\nanimalium), and On Moral Virtue (De virtute\nmorali). Plutarch's main works against the Epicureans are:\nThat One Cannot Live Happily Following Epicurus (Non\nposse suaviter vivere secundum Epicurum), Against\nColotes (Adversus Colotem), Is \u2018Live\nUnnoticed\u2019 Well Said? (An recte dictum sit latenter\nesse vivendum). All these works are marked by the use of a\ndistinct polemical tone against assumed adversaries, and of\nrecognizable polemical strategies. They are often captious and in many\ninstances betray a less than fair engagement with the views being\nopposed (see Warren 2011, 290\u2013293 and Kechagia 2011,\n135\u2013294 for a vindication of Plutarch's polemics in Against\nColotes).\n\nIt is worth considering why Plutarch engaged in writing so many\npolemical works against the two main Hellenistic schools of\nphilosophy.  One reason for Plutarch's preoccupation must be that the\nearly Stoics and Epicureans both strongly criticized Plato. The\nEpicurean Colotes, for instance, Plutarch's target in the Against\nColotes, was critical of Plato's dialogues in his Against\nPlato's Lysis and Against Plato's Euthydemus (meager fragments\nof which are preserved in Herculaneum papyri PHerc. 208,\nPHerc. 1032), while he also criticized the\nRepublic's myth of Er and the implied view of an immortal\nhuman soul (Proclus, In Rempublicam 2.109.11\u201312,\n111.6\u201317; see Kechagia 2011, 53\u2013132).  Another reason for\nPlutarch's engagement was the fact that both Epicureans and Stoics\ndrew freely and extensively for their own purposes on Plato without\nacknowledging it and despite their criticism of Plato. This holds true\nespecially for the Stoics (see Babut 1969a). They were inspired by the\nTimaeus, for instance, in their adoption of two principles,\ngod and matter, but their god, unlike that of Plato, is immanent in\nthe physical world and bodily, and he alone, without the Forms,\nsuffices for the formation of matter. The Stoics were probably guided\nto their view that only bodies exist by passages in the\nSophist (246a-247c) and in the Timaeus (31b-32c,\n49d-e, 53b-c). For Plutarch, though, this is an utterly mistaken\nreading of the Timaeus (De communibus notitiis\n1073D-1074E). Plutarch's polemics were, then, motivated by his desire to\nadvocate Platonism against what he regarded as misguided\ninterpretations and criticisms on the part of Epicureans and\nStoics. This defense of Platonism was of vital importance for\nPlatonism at Plutarch's time, since both Stoicism and Epicureanism were\nstill thriving, mainly in virtue of their ethics. Plutarch wanted to\nshow that Stoic and Epicurean ethics rest on mistaken assumptions\nabout human nature and reality, which render their ethical doctrines\nuseless (De virtute morali, De Stoicorum\nrepugnantiis 1041E-1043A, De communibus notitiis\n1060B-1073D). Plutarch's polemics were fuelled by the view he shares\nwith Hellenistic philosophers that the end of philosophy is to support\nethical life (see e.g. De profectibus in virtute); if a\nschool's ethical ideal is unrealizable or, worse, unworthy of human nature,\nthis for Plutarch (as for Antiochus, Cicero, De finibus 5.13,\n5.89) is evidence that the entire philosophical system is a\nfailure. As in the rest of his philosophical works, in his polemical\ntreatises too, Plutarch aims to show that Plato's philosophy makes\ngood sense as a whole, that is, it does justice to the world and human\nnature and can bring human beings to happiness (see below, sect. 2),\nbut in his polemical works Plutarch aims especially to demonstrate\nthat departure from Plato results in self-contradictions, of which he\naccuses the Stoics in particular (Boys-Stones 1997a). Two further\nfeatures of Stoic and Epicurean philosophy appear to annoy Plutarch\nconsiderably: first, their dismissal of the aporetic/dialectical\nspirit that Socrates embodies, and which Plutarch regards as central\nto philosophy, and second, that Stoics and Epicureans alike adopt a\ncorporealist or materialist metaphysics, rejecting the intelligible\nrealm (that comprises god, Forms, immaterial souls), which was\nessential to Platonism. The central line permeating Plutarch's\nrelevant criticism is that Stoics and Epicureans contradict our common\nnotions (see e.g. De communibus notitiis 1073C-1074F) and do\nnot do justice to things themselves (De profectibus in\nvirtute 75F-76A). Ironically, perhaps, Plutarch's polemical\nwritings are chiefly of interest\u2014but also of very great\nvalue\u2014for the many quotations they contain from Stoics,\nEpicurus, and other authors whose works were not preserved into modern\ntimes, and for his references to and paraphrases of their views in\nother passages of works available to him but not to us. Were it not\nfor Plutarch, our grasp of Stoic and Epicurean philosophy would be\nmuch less extensive than it is, and our ability to reconstruct and\nappreciate their ideas much reduced.\n\nHere is an overview of Plutarch's works, to give a sense of his\nconception of philosophy and of what in Platonist philosophy especially\nhe valued.\n\nPlutarch wrote relatively little in the field of \u201clogic\u201d\nin the ancient sense (logik\u00ea), which includes\nphilosophy of language and epistemology. This, however, does not\nnecessarily point to a lack of interest or knowledge on his\npart. Quite the opposite is the case. Plutarch is particularly\nattracted to epistemology because he considers this as a crucial\naspect of Platonist philosophy. He seeks to defend the epistemology of\nAcademic skeptics like Arcesilaus and Carneades and on these grounds\nto advocate the unity of the Academy against the criticisms of\nAntiochus of Ascalon (1st c. BCE; see below, sects. 2 and\n3). The Lamprias list of Plutarch's works contains one on Stoic logic\n(Reply to Chrysippus on the First Consequent, #152), and two\non Aristotle's: On Aristotle's Topics in eight books (#56),\nand a Lecture on the Ten Categories (#192), all of them now\nlost. The latter two are indicative of a reawakening of interest in\nAristotelian logic, beginning in the 1st c. BCE, cultivated\nmainly by Peripatetics such as Boethus and Andronicus, but also\ncharacterizing Platonists of Plutarch's era, such as Eudorus and\nNicostratus, who set themselves in dialogue especially with\nAristotle's Categories.  Although the content of these\nPlutarchean works remains unknown, we do have Plutarch's own claim\nthat Aristotle's doctrine of categories is foreshadowed in the\nTimaeus (De an.  procr. 1023E; Timaeus\n37b-c), which suggests that he considered Aristotelian logic a welcome\ndevelopment of relevant Platonic ideas (Karamanolis 2006,\n123\u2013125). Plutarch's interest in the Topics, on the\nother hand, must have been motivated by his interest in the\ndialectical methodology of arguing both sides of a question\n(Karamanolis 2006, 86\u201387; see further below, sect. 3), to which\nthe Topics is devoted. Plutarch's works on epistemology cover\na broad spectrum of issues. The question of the criterion of truth\nmust have been central to works such as On How We Should Judge\nTruth (#225), What is Understanding?  (#144), That\nUnderstanding is Impossible (#146), none of which is extant\ntoday. The lost work Whether He Who Suspends Judgment on\nEverything is Led to Inaction (#158) must have confronted the\ncommon accusation against skepticism voiced in its title. Among\nPlutarch's surviving works important for understanding his\nepistemology are the Platonic Questions I and III,\nAgainst Colotes, On Common Notions, and On the\nGeneration of the Soul 1024F-1025A (see below, sect.  3).\n\nPlutarch paid special attention to \u201cphysics,\u201d, which in\nantiquity included metaphysics, natural philosophy, psychology and\ntheology. His most important surviving works in metaphysics are those\nrelated to the interpretation of the Timaeus, namely On\nthe Generation of Soul in the Timaeus (De animae procreatione\nin Timaeo), On Isis and Osiris (De Iside et\nOsiride); from lost works of Plutarch relevant are the following:\nWhere are the Forms? (#67), How Matter Participates in\nthe Forms: It Constitutes the Primary Bodies (#68), On the\nWorld's Having Come into Beginning According to Plato (#66),\nOn Matter (#185), On the Fifth Substance\n(#44). Plutarch shows quite some interest in the explanation of\nnatural phenomena in several surviving works, most importantly in:\nOn the Face Which Appears in the Orb of the Moon (De facie quae in\norbe lunae apparet), On the Principle of Cold (De primo\nfrigido), On the Cleverness of Animals (De sollertia\nanimalism). Plutarch's interest in this area is apparently\nmotivated by the wish to develop Platonist natural philosophy and also\noppose the Stoics, who were dominant in this field especially since\nPosidonius (1st c. BCE), and in Plutarch's age with his\nmuch older contemporary Seneca (ca. 1BCE\u201365CE), the\nauthor of Naturales Quaestiones. Given the importance of god\nin the world's coming into being according to Plutarch, he is\nseriously engaged with theology, especially with questions pertaining\nto the relation between god and man, such as the issue of divination,\ndivine justice and divine punishment, and so on, in: On Oracles at\nDelphi (De Pythiae oraculis), On the Obsolescence of\nOracles (De defectu oraculorum), On the E at\nDelphi (De E apud Delphos), On Delays in Divine\nPunishment (De sera numinis vindicta), and On the\nDaemon of Socrates (De genio Socratis Socratis).\nPlutarch's On the Generation of Soul in the Timaeus together\nwith the ten Platonic Questions illustrate well his work as a\nPlatonic exegete (see Hershbell 1987, Ferrari 2001). Like the former\nwork, most of the Platonic Questions also deal with\nmetaphysics and psychology (Questions I and III are concerned\nwith epistemology, VII with physics, and X with language).\n\nPlutarch's ethical works include some of theoretical orientation\n(e.g. On Moral Virtue, which refutes the Stoic theory of\nvirtue) and some of practical one (e.g. On Control of Anger, On\nCuriosity, How Could you Tell a Flatterer from a Friend),\noffering practical advice on how to attain virtue and build a good\ncharacter. The tendency, however, to distinguish two altogether\nseparate classes of ethical works (following Ziegler 1951,\n768\u2013825) is problematic given the considerable affinities\nbetween them, yet Plutarch does use different styles in them,\npresumably targeting different audiences (Van Hoof 2010,\n264\u2013265). Particularly representative of Plutarch's ethical\nviews are the treatises On Moral Virtue (De virtute\nmorali), On Making Progress in Virtue (De\nprofectibus in virtute), On Delays in Divine Punishment\n(De sera numinis vindicta), On Control of Anger\n(De cohibenda ira), and On Tranquility of Mind\n(De tranquillitate animi). Plutarch wrote also works on\naesthetics and education, which one could classify also as works of\npractical orientation. Plutarch, following Plato, evaluates poetry\nfrom the point of view of ethical education. In this category belong\nthe works On How the Young Man Should Listen to Poets (De\naudiendis poetis) and On the Education of Children\n(De liberis educandis), the latter of dubious authenticity\n(Ziegler 1951, 809\u2013811).\n\nFinally, Plutarch wrote a number of works on aspects and figures of the\nhistory of philosophy, all lost, such as On What Heraclitus\nMaintained (#205), On Empedocles (#43), On the\nCyrenaics (#188), On the Difference between Pyrrhonians and\nAcademics (#64), On the Unity of the Academy Since Plato\n(#63). The latter two could not have been merely historical, however; the\nhistorical perspective must rather have served to defend the point of view of the\nskeptical Academy, which Plutarch advocated as doing justice to the\naporetic spirit of Plato's philosophy (see below, sect. 2).\n2. Plutarch's Platonism\n\n\nPlutarch lived in the wake of the revival of the dogmatic\ninterpretation of Plato begun by Antiochus and Eudorus in the\n1st c. BCE, which in a way he continues. Plutarch, however,\nshows a more complex philosophical profile, apparently through\ndeveloping the version of Academic skepticism defended by Antiochus'\ncontemporary Philo of Larissa and also (slightly later) Cicero. He\nstrives for a synthesis of the skeptical interpretation of Plato,\ndefended by the Academic skeptics Arcesilaus, Carneades and Philo,\nwith that of Antiochus' dogmatic interpretation, according to which\nPlato held doctrines of his own. Thus Plutarch objects to the\ndistinction that Antiochus suggested between Socratic and Platonic\nphilosophy and the corresponding division of Plato's dialogues into\nSocratic/aporetic and Platonic/doctrinal (Cicero, Academica\nI.15\u201317). For Plutarch, rather Plato accommodates harmoniously\nboth an aporetic and a doctrinal element in his philosophy. According\nto Plutarch, the aporetic element in Plato encourages a way of\nsearching for the truth without prejudices or a priori commitments,\nand this practically amounts to a dialectical inquiry, arguing either\nside of a given question; but this dialectical spirit does not deny\nthe possibility of reaching firm conclusions, or even the possibility\nof achieving secure knowledge. According to Plutarch, Plato had\nreached such conclusions in his dialogues, which can be identified as\nPlato's doctrines and yet he still preserved the spirit of unceasing\ninquiry, embedded in the dialogue form itself, by not holding them in\na way which closed off reconsideration and further inquiry. This is\nwhy Plutarch advocates an epistemology that integrates both the\nsuspension of judgment (i.e., the rejection of dogmatism) and a\ndefense of the possibility of acquiring true knowledge (see below,\nsect. 3). On this basis Plutarch defends the unity of the Academy,\ngoing all the way back to Plato, which Antiochus had considered as\nhaving been disrupted with the advent of Academic Skepticism, in lost\ntreatises, such as On the Unity of the Academy since Plato,\nOn the Difference Between Pyrrhoneans and Academics (see\nAdversus Colotem 1121F-1122E, Platonic Question I;\nwith Opsomer 1998, 127\u2013133). Plutarch actually tried to\ndisengage the term \u2018Academic\u2019 from implying exclusive\ncommitment to the skeptical construal of Plato. Suspension of\njudgment, he thinks, is rather an established method of philosophical\nresearch followed by several illustrious ancient philosophers\n(Heraclitus, Parmenides, Socrates, Plato), rather than an innovation\nof Arcesilaus (Adv. Col. 1121F-1122A). For Plutarch, the\nAcademic both appreciates Plato's aporetic spirit and still values his\ndoctrines. Similar in this respect appears to be the position of the\nanonymous author of the (1st c. CE?) Commentary on the\nTheaetetus and of Plutarch's friend Favorinus, the addressee of\nhis On the Principle of Cold (cf. ibid. 955C, see Opsomer\n1997, Opsomer 1998, 26\u201382, 213\u2013240).\n\nIn accordance with this conception of Platonism, Plutarch himself\nwrites dialogues, which, like Plato's, are either dramatic\n(e.g. De cohibenda ira), narrated (e.g. De sera numinis\nvindicta), or mixed (De genio Socratis); see the\ntypology of Platonic dialogues in Diogenes Laertius 3.50). As in\nPlato, in Plutarch's dialogues too the speakers give long speeches in\nfavor of a certain view (Russell 1973, 34\u201336). It is often\nunclear, however, with what view Plutarch sympathizes, despite the\nfact that sometimes he appears as character in some dialogues\n(e.g. On the E at Delphi). Besides, Plutarch, following Plato\nagain, often uses myths, metaphors, and analogies. The work On\nIsis and Osiris is particularly interesting in this regard. In it\nPlutarch relates the myth of the two Egyptian deities, yet he\ninterprets it allegorically as a story informative about god, being,\nand creation (Ziegler 1951, 206\u2013208). Of special interest are\nthe eschatological myths in Plutarch, as they integrate cosmological,\npsychological, and ethical considerations. This is the case with the\nmyth narrated in On The Face Which Appears in the Orb of the\nMoon, which centers on the role of the moon in the world and its\nrole in the life of souls (see Cherniss, Plutarch Moralia,\nvol. XII, Loeb, Introduction). Analogous is the case of the work\nOn the Delays of the Divine Vengeance, where Plutarch sets\nout to defend divine providence, yet, following Plato's claim of\npresenting only a likely account (eik\u00f4s mythos) in the\nTimaeus, he claims to be offering only what seems likely to\nhim about divine actions (549E-F), and also like Plato, Plutarch\nstructures his work into argument (logos) and a narrative\n(mythos). These authorial practices present a problem for the\nscholar who wants to identify Plutarch's own philosophical views, just\nas they do with Plato's own dialogues. The works that unambiguously\npresent Plutarch's opinions on exegetical and philosophical matters\nare On the Generation of Soul in the Timaeus, and\nPlatonic Questions, while the others must be used with\ncaution, for the reasons given above, or because of their polemical\naim and tone (see Opsomer 2007).\n\nPlutarch represents a synthesis also with regard to his philosophical\ninterests. On the one hand he shares Antiochus' emphasis on ethics,\nyet on the other he focuses considerably on metaphysics, which was\nrevived by Eudorus (end of 1st c. BCE) and flourished with\nNeo-Pythagorean Platonists such as Moderatus (1st\nc. CE). Like them, Plutarch (as noted above) pays special attention to\nthe Timaeus, which from then on became the keystone of\nPlatonism. Plutarch is particularly interested in the generation of\nthe soul, and he devotes an entire treatise to discussing one short\npassage, Timaeus 35a1\u201336b5 (On the Generation of\nSoul in the Timaeus; see Cherniss, Plutarch Moralia,\nLoeb vol. XIII.1, 133\u2013149, Hershbell 1987). It is not an\nexaggeration to say that Plutarch's interpretation of the\nTimaeus shapes his entire philosophy. This is because\nPlutarch apparently endorses the idea suggested in the\nTimaeus that the universe is a unified whole with humans\nbeing an integral part of this unity, which means that both the\nphysical world and natural phenomena as well as human beings and human\nsociety should be approached from a cosmic/metaphysical point of\nview. In the case of natural phenomena, this means that explanations\nshould make reference to intelligible causes (De primo\nfrigido 948B-C) which account for the nature of things in the\nworld, while in the case of human beings, their nature and their final\nend in life, that is, their happiness cannot be determined unless one\nunderstands that the human constitution is similar to that of the\nworld, consisting of body, soul, and intellect (De facie\n943A, 945A, De virtute morali 441D).  Plutarch systematically\nemploys the analogy between worldly macrocosm and human microcosm,\nsuggested in the Timaeus, which is important also in Stoicism\n(see below, sect. 5, 6).\n\nPlutarch is also familiar with Neo-Pythagorean and Aristotelian\nphilosophies. Interest in both Pythagorean ideas and Aristotelianism\nwere in vogue at the end of the 1st century BCE and during\nthe 1st century CE, when Plutarch writes. There is a wave\nof Neo\u2013Pythagorean treatises written at this time, such as those\nof ps\u2013Archytas, Euryphamus, Theages (see Dillon 1977,\n341\u2013361, 1988b, 119\u2013122, Centrone 1990), while Plutarch's\ncontemporary Moderatus attempted to systematize Pythagorean ideas as\nbackground to Plato (he wrote a work Pythagorean Doctrines in\nmany books; Stephanus Byzantius, s.v. Gadeira, Porphyry,\nLife of Pythagoras 48; Dillon 1977,\n344\u2013351). Aristotelian philosophy, on the other hand, was\nrevived by Peripatetics and Platonists alike during this period. In\nthe Peripatetic camp this is the time when Andronicus of Rhodes was\nactive, being responsible for a complete edition of Aristotle's works\nat the end of the 1st century BCE, while Xenarchus of\nSeleukeia was critically engaged with Aristotle's physics. But already\nbefore them, Antiochus and Cicero had been well acquainted with\nAristotle's works, the former arguing that Aristotle was in essential\nagreement with Plato, at least in ethical theory (Cicero,\nAcademica I.17, De finibus V.12). Antiochus'\nstudents Aristo (of Alexandria) and Cratippus regarded themselves as\nPeripatetics (Index Academicorum col. 35.2-17 Dorandi), while\nthe Platonust Eudorus did not hesitate to use Aristotle in order to\nidentify Pythagorean metaphysical principles in Plato (Alexander,\nIn Met. 58.25\u201359.8 with reference to Aristotle\nMetaphysics 988a8\u201317). Plutarch was familiar with\nseveral Aristotelian treatises from all periods of his writing career\n(cf. Adv. Col. 1115B-C) and, quite interestingly, he\npreserves numerous fragments from lost Aristotelian works (see Ross,\nAristotelis Fragmenta Selecta, Karamanolis 2006,\n89\u201392). Plutarch's attitude to Pythagoreanism and Aristotle is\ncomplex and sophisticated.  Plutarch's cosmic principles, the One and\nthe Indefinite Dyad (De defectu oraculorum 428F-429A),\nallegedly found in the Timaeus, had long been considered\nPythagorean in origin. Plutarch shows his familiarity with\nPythagoreanism in the second (and rather cryptic) part of On the\nGeneration of the Soul in Timaeus, where he seeks to explain the\nnature and role of numbers and ratios in the Timaeus making\nrepeated references to Pythagoreans. Plutarch also integrates into\nPlatonism other Pythagorean elements, such as number symbolism (De\nE 387F, De def. or. 429D-430B), abstinence from meat\n(On the Eating of Flesh; De esu carnium), and a belief in the\nrationality of animals (On the Cleverness of Animals, Beasts are\nRational; Bruta Animalia Ratione Uti), probably because he\nconsiders them implied in, or compatible with, statements made in\nPlato (e.g. in the Phaedo, Timaeus). With regard to\nAristotle, Plutarch is more cautious than Antiochus; he considers some\nof Aristotle's doctrines to be an articulation or development of\nPlatonic philosophy (e.g. Aristotle's ethics, logic and science; see\nTeodorsson 1999), and espouses them as being Platonic (e.g. De\nvirtute morali 442B-C, De an. procr. 1023E). However, he\nalso criticizes Aristotle for contradicting Plato's presumed doctrines\n(e.g. on the Forms and on the constitution of the world;\nAdv. Col. 1114F-1115C; see Karamanolis 2006,\n85\u2013126).\n\nHence it is wrong to portray Plutarch as an eclectic philosopher (e.g.\nZiegler 1951, 940, F. Babbitt, Plutarch's Moralia,\nIntroduction, vol. I, Loeb 1927, xiv, Becchi 1981), who occasionally\ncompromises his Platonism in order to carry out his polemic\n(D\u00f6rrie 1971, Donini 1988b, 131, 1999, 16\u201319). Rather\nPlutarch uses philosophers such as Aristotle only instrumentally in\norder to advance through them what he perceives as Plato's doctrines\n(Karamanolis 2006, 92\u2013109). Plutarch shares with Antiochus\n(Cicero, Academica I.17\u201319, 33\u201334) the view that\nPlato's philosophy is subject to articulation and development through\nhis successors in the Platonist tradition, but also to\nmisinterpretation and distortion. On this view, Xenocrates, Polemo and\nAristotle developed and articulated Platonic philosophy, though not\nwithout faults, while the Stoics and Epicureans were instead guilty of\nsystematic distortion. Plutarch is not a populariser either (Babbitt op. cit.).\nRather, Plutarch's work shows great complexity and sophistication and\nevinces the spirit of a meticulous interpreter, who ventures to\nadvance innovative views, such as on the creation of the soul, on\nhuman constitution, as well as on ethics and poetics (see below,\nsects. 6 and 7). It is also unfair to say of Plutarch that he was\n\u201cno original thinker\u201d (Ziegler 1951,\n938\u2013939). Plutarch lived in an age in which philosophy had taken\nthe form of exegesis of classical philosophical texts, but through\nthis exegetical process philosophers in late antiquity (such as\nPlotinus and the commentators on Plato and Aristotle) crystallize and\nvoice their own views on crucial philosophical questions. Indeed\nPlutarch takes some very interesting lines on metaphysics, psychology,\nand ethics, which became influential in later generations of\nPlatonists, such as Plotinus and Porphyry (see below, sect. 4, 5,\n6).\n3. Logic/Epistemology\n\n\nLike the Hellenistic Philosophers and Antiochus, Plutarch appears to\nbe particularly sensitive to the question of how we acquire\nknowledge. Plutarch sets out to defend the interpretation of Plato's\nepistemology maintained in the skeptical Academy.  According to this\ninterpretation, suspension of judgment (epoch\u00ea) is the\nbest way to avoid overhasty commitment to opinions (doxai),\nsince the appearances on which they are based can be\ndeceitful. Plutarch defends this epistemological position against the\nStoic accusation that such an attitude leads to inaction, making life\nimpossible, and also against the Epicurean claim that\nsense-experiences are always true. Plutarch distinguishes between\nthree different movements in the soul, which are identical to those\nassumed by the Stoics, namely those of sensation\n(phantastikon), impulse (horm\u00ea), and assent\n(synkatathetikon; Adv. Col. 1122B). The first two\nalone, Plutarch argues, against the Stoics, suffice to produce action\n(Adv. Col. 1122C-D). Since suspension of judgment does not\ninterfere with either perception/sensation or impulse, it does not\naffect our actions but only eliminates opinions\n(ibid. 1122B). Consequently, Plutarch argues, suspension of judgment\nsaves us from making mistakes (1124B) but does not prevent us at all\nfrom acting. Opsomer (1998, 88) has rightly noted that Plutarch's\nargument is very similar to that of the Pyrrhonian skeptics. Plutarch\nrecommends suspension of judgment as a method of testing and\nevaluating knowledge obtained through the senses (Adv. Col.\n1124B). This is not only because the senses often deceive us (De\nprimo frigido 952A, De E392E); the problem according to\nPlutarch rather is that the world is a place that cannot be known\nperfectly. This, however, does not amount to dismissal of the senses,\nwhich is how Colotes criticized Plato\n(Adv. Col. 1114D-F). According to Plutarch, the senses are of\nlimited application because they can at best inform us only about the\nsensible world, which is a world of generation, of appearances, not of\nbeing (De E 392E). For a Platonist like Plutarch, perfect\nknowledge can only be of being, and for that we need to transcend the\nsensible world and move our thought to the intelligible one (De\nIside 382D-383A).\n\nPlutarch makes a sharp distinction between sensible and intelligible\nknowledge, which corresponds to the fundamental ontological\ndistinction between sensible or physical and intelligible reality\n(Plat.  Quest. 1002B-C). He appears to distinguish two\ndistinct faculties of human knowledge, the sensory and the\nintellectual, each of which grasps the corresponding part of reality\n(Plat. Quest. 1002D-E). The cognitive faculty for\nintelligibles, the human intellect, is external to the embodied soul\n(De an. procr. 1026E, Plat.  Quest. 1001C, 1002F;\ncf. Numenius fr. 42 Des Places); the sensory faculty, on the other\nhand, comes about when the soul enters the body (De virtute\nmorali 442B-F; see below, sect. 5), and provides the means for\ndealing effectively in daily life with our needs and circumstances in\nthe physical world as it appears to our senses. In Plutarch's view,\nhuman beings come to understand through the intellect by making use of\nthe notions or concepts (ennoiai), apparently identifiable\nwith the Forms (Plat. Quest. 1001E), with which the intellect\nis inherently equipped. That is, the embodied soul recollects what it\nknows from its inherent familiarity with the intelligible realm, as\nPlato argued in the discussion of anamn\u00easis or\nrecollection in the Meno (Plat. Quest. 1001D, 1002E;\nOpsomer 1998, 193\u2013198). This knowledge of intelligibles is\nsuperior to sensory \u201cknowledge,\u201d which can only remain at\nthe level of belief (pistis) and conjecture\n(eikasia; Plat. Quest. 1001C). Indeed, knowledge of\nintelligibles can take one as far as to understand the divine realm\n(ibid. 1002E, 1004D). But we can achieve this kind of knowledge,\nPlutarch suggests, only when \u201csouls are free to migrate to the\nrealm of the indivisible and the unseen\u201d (De Iside\n382F). This is the main task of philosophy for Plutarch. Philosophy in\nhis view must be inspired by the Socratic practice of inquiry, and\nthis practice amounts to the continuous search for truth, which\npresupposes that, following the example of Socrates, one admits\nignorance (Adv. Col. 1117D, De adulatore et amico\n72A).\n\nAccording to Plutarch, knowledge of intelligibles through\nanamn\u00easis is not in tension with the Academic\nprescription for suspension of judgment; rather, knowledge can be\nadvanced by suspension of judgment, since the latter puts aside\nopinion (doxa) as well as egoism (philautia), both\nof which prevent us from finding the truth\n(Plat. Quest. 1000C). To be in a position to carry out this\nsearch for truth, however, one must search oneself and purify one's\nsoul, Plutarch argues (Adv. Col.  1118C-E). And he points out\nthat Socrates promoted precisely this practice, using the\nelenchus as a purgative medicine, trying to remove false\nclaims to knowledge and arrogance from the souls of his interlocutors,\nand to seek truth along with them, instead of defending his own view\n(Plat. Quest. 999E-F, 1000B, 1000D; Opsomer 1988, 145-150,\nShiffman 2010). Socrates, Plutarch claims, was in a position to do\nthat because he had purified his soul from passions (De genio\nSocratis 588E), hence he was capable of understanding the voice\nof his daim\u00f4n, his intellect (see below, sect. 5).\n\nPlutarch does not defend the Socratic-Academic epistemology only at\nthe theoretical level, but also applies it practically. While\ndiscussing in On the Principle of Cold whether cold is a\nprinciple rather than a privation and whether earth is the primary\ncold element, he defends suspension of judgment as the right attitude\nto take on the matter (955C; see Babut 2007, 72\u201376 contra\nBoys-Stones 1997b). This is indicative of Plutarch's attitude to\nnatural phenomena quite generally. He maintains that natural phenomena\ncannot be understood merely by means of investigating their natural\ncauses. The discovery of the immediate, natural causes, Plutarch\nargues, is only the beginning of an investigation into the first and\nhighest causes, which are intelligible (De primo frigido\n948B-C; Donini 1986a, 210-211, Opsomer 1998, 215\u20136). In other\nwords, a metaphysical explanation in terms of the Forms and god, the\ncreator of the universe, must be sought (De def.  or.\n435E-436A). This is what, for Plutarch, demarcates the philosopher\nfrom the mere natural scientist (physikos; De primo\nfrigido 948B-C), a distinction further exploited by later\nPlatonists (e.g. Atticus fr. 5 Des Places, Porphyry in Simplicius,\nIn Physica 9.10\u201313; fr. 119 Smith). Plutarch is guided\nhere by the dichotomy between natural and intelligible causes found in\nPhaedo 97B-99D and Timaeus 68E-69D (Opsomer 1998,\n183). Explaining the physical world through an appeal to natural\ncauses alone is insufficient, Plutarch argues, since such an explanation\nignores the agent (god) and the end for which something happens in the world\n(De def. or. 435E). The fundamental ontological and\nepistemological distinction between the sensible and intelligible\nrealms suggests to Plutarch an analogous distinction of corresponding\nlevels of explanation (Donini 1986a, 212, Opsomer 1998, 217). Plutarch\nmaintains that there are two levels of causality, physical and\nintelligible, and full understanding of natural phenomena requires the\ngrasping of both. While in the case of natural phenomena suspension of\njudgment maintains an unfailing spirit of research, in the case of\nthe divine realm, where human understanding is seriously limited,\nsuspension of judgment, Plutarch suggests, is due also as a form of\npiety towards the divine (De sera 549E; Opsomer 1998,\n178\u2013179).\n4. Metaphysics\n4.1 First Principles\n\n\nPlutarch's metaphysics rests heavily on his interpretation of the\nTimaeus. Plutarch maintains that the cosmogony of the\nTimaeus must be interpreted literally, which means that the\nworld had a temporal beginning (Plat. Quest. 1001B-C, De\nan. procr. 1013C-1024C; cf. Timaeus 30a, 52d-53b).\nPlutarch argues against the interpretation of most Platonists of his\ntime, who refuse to understand creation in terms of an actual\ngeneration (De an. procr. 1013E). He appears to believe that\nhis interpretation is the only way to understand Plato's claim that\nthe soul is \u201csenior\u201d to the body (Timaeus 34c),\nand that it initiates all change and motion (De an. procr.\n1013D-F; Phaedrus 245c, Laws 896a-c). This literal\ninterpretation of the Timaeus also aims to solve the puzzle\nof how the soul in Plato is said to be both uncreated\n(Phaedrus 245c-246a) as well as created (Timaeus\n34b-35a; De an. procr. 1016A), and how the soul is said to be\na mixed entity composed of indivisible being (i.e.  intellect) and\ndivisible being (i.e. the non-rational pre-cosmic soul;\nTimaeus 35a; De an. procr. 1014D-E, 1024A). Plutarch\ntries to address these issues in a number of works (see above, sect.\n1), most importantly, of the surviving ones, in On the Generation\nof Soul in the Timaeus, a commentary on Timaeus\n35a1\u201336b5, as I noted above.\n\nPlutarch proposes the following interpretation. The cosmos is an\nordered entity that has come into existence at a certain point (when\ntime did not exist; Plat. Quest. 1007C) as a result of the\ncontact between god and pre-existing, disorderly matter. God puts this\nmatter in order (De an. procr. 1024C; cf. De Iside\n374E-F), which means that god cannot be the only cosmic principle,\notherwise disorderly matter would be left unaccounted for. Plutarch\npostulates two antithetic and antagonistic cosmic principles: the one\nis God (the Monad or the One, the unitary eternal substance from which\neverything devolves; see below sect. 4.3), and the other is the\nIndefinite Dyad, both principles being eternal and uncreated (De\ndef. or.  428E-F). God is the real being, unchangeable, simple\n(De E 392E-393B), and good (De def. or.\n423D)\u2014the cause of order, intelligibility, stability, and\nidentity in the universe. This is why God is the object of striving\nfor all nature (De facie 944E). The Indefinite Dyad, on the\nother hand, is the principle of non-being, multiplicity, disorder,\nchaos, irrationality and badness (De def.  or. 428F). This\nprinciple is described as being identical with matter which is ordered\nby God (De def. or. 428F-429D) or by its logos\n(De Iside 373A-C), yet the existence in it of an active\nelement which is essentially disorderly and evil (De Iside\n369D\u2013F; Dillon 1977, 206\u20138) seems to suggest that the\nIndefinite Dyad is regarded not merely as identical with matter, taken\nas the underlying element of all qualities, as is suggested in\nTimaeus 50e (De def. or. 414F).). These two\nprinciples, God and the Indefinite Dyad, were allegedly accepted by\nthe ancient Pythagoreans (Diogenes Laertius 8.24\u201325; Diels-Kranz\n58 \u0392l), and by the Neo-Pythagoreans of Plutarch's time (Sextus\nEmpiricus, Against the Mathematicians 10.261\u2013284,\nNicomachus, Introductio Arithmetica II.18.4; see Dillon 1977,\n342\u20133, 354), but they were also attributed to Plato (Plato,\nParmenides 149d2, Simplicius, In Physica\n453.25\u20137), presumably by neo-Pythagorean Platonists (Eudorus in\nSimplicius, In Physica 181.7\u201330, Moderatus,\nibid. 231.8\u20139; see Kahn 2001, 105\u2013110 and Numenius in\nSEP). Plutarch identifies the two principles with the Limited and the\nUnlimited of the Philebus (he also calls the Indefinite Dyad\nlimitlessness, apeiria; De def. or. 428F). The two\nprinciples are constantly opposing each other in the form of goodness\nand badness (De def. or. 429B-D, De Iside 369E;\nDillon 1977, 203). Although God, the One, prevails over the Dyad\n(De def. or. 429C-D), order and goodness are always in danger\nof being displaced by disorder and badness. Both the Indefinite Dyad\nand God relate to the universe through intermediaries, namely a\nnon-rational and a rational world soul (see above), which operate as\nantithetic powers of the two antagonistic cosmic principles. The\nresult of the interaction of the two cosmic principles through these\npowers is the cosmos in which humans live.\n\nThis interaction happens in stages. Before the world has come into\nbeing, the universe was animated by the non-rational world soul, which\naccounts for the disordered motion of matter. In Plutarch's words,\n\u201cwhat preceded the generation of the world was disorder,\ndisorder not incorporeal or immobile or inanimate, but of corporeality\namorphous and incoherent, and of motivity demented and irrational, and\nthis was the discord of soul that has not reason\u201d (De an.\nprocr. 1014B; Cherniss' trans., altered). Plato speaks indeed of\nthe receptacle as amorphous (Timaeus 50d7, 51a7), there is,\nhowever, no explicit mention of a non-rational pre-cosmic soul in the\nTimaeus, which is why Plutarch has been accused of\narbitrariness in this regard (Cherniss, Plutarch Moralia,\nLoeb vol. XIII.1, 140\u2013147). It is wrong, though, to treat\nPlutarch as one might treat a modern commentator of the\nTimaeus, with conscientious scholarly attention to what is\nand is not made explicit in a text.  Plutarch assumes that there is a\nsingle \u201cPlatonic view\u201d about the generation of the world,\nthe first principles of reality, and the role of soul in the world's\ngeneration, and he seeks support for his interpretation in many\nPlatonic dialogues. He identifies the non-rational soul with the\n\u201cdisorderly and maleficent soul\u201d of Laws X (a\ntestimony Plutarch himself considers unambiguous, De Iside\n370F), with the \u201climitlessness\u201d of the Philebus\n(26b), the \u201ccongenital desire\u201d and \u201cinbred\ncharacter\u201d of the Politicus (272d, 273b), and with the\nnecessity (anank\u00ea) and the generation\n(genesis) of Timaeus 52d (De an. procr.\n1014D-1015A). None of these passages lend clear support to Plutarch's\ninterpretation, since nowhere does Plato explicitly speak of a\npre-cosmic maleficent soul or other pre-cosmic soul-like entities:\neven the maleficent soul of the Laws is not pre-cosmic\n(Cherniss, ibid. 140). Yet Plutarch's interpretation does have merits\nin imposing consistency on Plato's work as a whole in the following\nsense. First, according to the Timaeus (35a) the demiurge\n(the creator god) does not create the substance of the soul, but\ncompounds the world soul by blending indivisible with divisible being,\nwhich Plutarch not unreasonably identifies with the divine intellect\nand the non-rational world soul respectively (De\nan. procr. 1014D-E).  This does justice to the nature of the\nsoul, which for Platonists is not subject to change and\ncorruption. Secondly, it was generally assumed that no motion is\npossible without a principle of motion (cf. Aristotle, De\nanima 402a6\u20137), and this traditionally is identified with\nthe soul in Platonism (cf.  Phaedrus 245c-e); so the\ndisordered motion of matter before the creation of cosmos that Plato\nappears to postulate in the Timaeus needs to be accounted for\nby a soul (see Laws 892a), which must, then, be a pre-cosmic\none (De an. procr.  1015E).\n\nFurther, the existence of a pre-cosmic non-rational soul is suggested\nalso if one considers the world soul and the human soul in\nconjunction.  Already the Timaeus (34c, 41d-e, 69c) suggests\na relation between the two. Plutarch takes the human soul to be\nderivative from the world soul, which means that their natures are\nsimilar (De an.  procr. 1025A-D; see below, sect. 5). In\nRepublic 4, in the Phaedrus and also in the\nTimaeus it is argued that the human soul has a rational and a\nnon-rational aspect, fighting for dominance. And it is suggested that\norder and harmony is established in the soul when the rational aspect\nrules over the non-rational, yet the non-rational aspect is always\ncapable of revolting against rationality and creating disorder and\nbadness. Plutarch identifies the rational aspect with intellect, which\nhe distinguishes from the soul, making the former the cause of order\nand goodness while the latter the cause of disorder and badness\n(De an. procr. 1015E; see below, sect. 5). If the human soul\nreflects the nature of the world soul, then also in the latter even\nwhen rationality prevails, when the cosmos comes into being, there is\nroom for disharmony and disorder. This is evidenced by occurrences of\nbadness in the world, such as accidents, natural catastrophes, etc. If\nthere is no such non-rational aspect in the world soul, then either\nGod must be ultimately accountable for such phenomena, which is what\nthe Stoics maintain \u2013 and this, argues Plutarch, hardly fits\nGod's goodness (De an. procr. 1015A\u2013B) \u2013 or they\nmust happen without cause, as the Epicureans maintain, which then\ndiminishes God's ruling power (ibid. 1015C). Better to think that such\noccurences are caused by the non-rational aspect of the world\nsoul. Finally, a pre-cosmic soul is needed to play the role of\nmediator between God and matter (De an. procr. 1015B, 1024C;\ncf. Timaeus 35a), which is required in order to maintain\nGod's transcendence, goodness, and purity, since matter, because of\nits inherent disorderliness and badness, pollutes and taints, and thus\nis hardly worthy of God (cf. Numenius fr. 52.37\u201339 Des Places;\nsee also below, sect. 4.3).\n\nThe first stage in creation is that God imparts his own intelligence\nand reason to the pre-cosmic non-rational soul, making it into a\npartly rational thing (De an. procr. 1014C-D, 1016E-D,\nPlat.  Quest. 1001B-C). Plutarch makes clear that the\nrational world soul is \u201cnot merely a work but also a part of God\nand has come to be not by his agency, but both from him as a source\nand out of his substance\u201d (Plat. Quest. 1001C). Since\nthe world soul, thus constructed, contains divine reason, which is a\n\u201cportion\u201d (moira) or \u201cefflux\u201d\n(aporrho\u00ea) of God (De Iside 382B), it is not\nmerely a product of God but rather an inseparable part of him (De\nsera 559D, Plat. Quest. 1001C). That is, the world soul\nbecomes assimilated to God (homoi\u00f4sis; De sera\n550D). This does not entirely eradicate the world soul's initial\nnon-rationality (De an. procr. 1027A), yet the motions\nproduced by the world soul become now (for the most part) harmonious\nand orderly (De an. procr. 1014C-E). This means that matter\nceases to be disordered and indefinite. Matter now becomes stable and\n\u201csimilar to the entities that are invariably identical\u201d\n(ibid. 1015F). Presumably Plutarch is referring here to the\ntranscendent Forms. He states that the cosmos comes into being when\nthe soul disperses the semblances from the intelligible world to this\none (ibid. 1024C; cf. Timaeus 50c-e, 52d-53c). Plutarch\nappears to maintain that the world soul is capable of being molded by\nreceiving the intelligible Forms, which is how presumably the world\nsoul becomes rational (De an. procr. 1024C). The world soul,\nthen, transmits the Forms onto matter (De Iside 373A, De\nPyth. orac.  404C). This transmission seems to take a two-stage\nprocess, allegedly implied in the Timaeus. First, the Forms\ninform matter to bring about primary bodies, such as water and fire,\nas Timaeus 53b-d, 69b-c suggests (De an. procr.\n1025A-B, Plat.  Quest. 1001D-E); second, the imposition of\nfurther Forms on matter brings about compound material stuffs and\ndifferent kinds of objects, which make up the cosmos (De\nIside 372E-F, 373E-F).\n\nThe precise role of Forms in Plutarch's interpretation of the creation\nremains obscure. Plutarch discussed this issue in treatises no longer\nextant, such as, for example, Where are the Forms?, yet the\nrelevant surviving evidence is inconclusive (see though Schoppe 1994,\nFerrari 1995, 1996b). Some insight can be gained from the myth of Isis\nand Osiris, which Plutarch presents as an analogy to the world\ncreation in his De Iside et Osiride. Osiris is a divine\nintellect that brings everything into being by being sown in matter,\nthat is, in Isis, the reasons (logoi) of himself (De\nIside 372E-F), eventually producing Horus, i.e. the cosmos (ibid.\n374A, De an. procr. 1026C). Osiris is identified with the\ngood itself (372E), to which Isis always inclines, offering herself to\nbe impregnated \u201c with effluxes and likenesses in which she\nrejoices\u201d (ibid. 373A).  Apparently Osiris stands for the\ndemiurge of the Timaeus and also the Form of the Good of the\nRepublic (cf. De an. procr. 1017 A-B) \u2014which\nexplains why Osiris constitutes the object of desire by nature and\nIsis (De Iside 372E-F; cf. De facie 944E) and Isis\nstands for the receptacle (De Iside ibid., De\nan. procr. 1026C; Timaeus 49a, 51a). This suggests that\nPlutarch probably maintained the existence of the Forms in God\n(cf. Timaeus 39e), as did several other Platonists in late\nantiquity (e.g. Alcinous, Didascalikos 163.11\u201317, with\nDillon 1993, 93\u201396). This is supported by the fact that for\nPlutarch Osiris is both the intellect and the logos present\nin the world soul (De Iside 371A, 376C, De\nan. procr. 1023C\u2013D) and by Plutarch's claim that God is the\ntotality of Forms (paradeigma; De sera 550D; see\nHelmig 2005, 20\u201326). However, it is not clear how for Plutarch\nthe Forms exist in God, since in Plutarch's view God, as Osiris, can\nbe analyzed into three elements, intellect, soul, and body (De\nIside 373A). That Plutarch makes such a distinction with regard\nto God is also supported by his claim that \u201cGod is not senseless\nnor inanimate nor subject to human control\u201d (De Iside\n377E-F) and also by his reference to the body of Osiris, which\nsymbolizes the Forms immanent in matter (ibid.; Dillon 1977,\n200). Presumably, then, Plutarch assumes the existence of a divine\nsoul, guided by statements in Plato Philebus 30c,\nSophist 248d-249a, Timaeus 46d-e, according to which\nthe intellect, to the extent that it implies life, requires the\npresence of the principle of life, namely soul (Plat. Quest.\n1002F).\n\nThere is a question, then, as to where in the divine creator the\ntranscendent Forms reside. We have reason to believe that Plutarch\nplaces the Forms not in the intellect of the divine creator as\nthoughts, as was assumed by several later Platonists (e.g. Alcinous,\nPorphyry), but rather in the soul (Schoppe 1994, 172\u2013178, Baltes\n2001; against Opsomer 2001, 195\u2013197). Syrianus testifies this\nexplicitly (In Metaphysica 105.36\u201338), while we find\nthe same doctrine also in Atticus (frs. 8, 11, 35 Des Places;\nKaramanolis 2006, 169\u2013170), who was said in antiquity to follow\nPlutarch in the interpretation of the cosmogony of the\nTimaeus (Iamblichus, De anima, in Stobaeus 1.49.37,\nProclus, In Timaeum 1.276.30\u2013277.7, 325.30\u2013326.6;\nAtticus frs. 10, 19, 22 Des Places). The reason for endorsing such a\nview presumably was that it allows one to maintain the utter\nsimplicity and order of the demiurgic intellect, so as to preserve God\nas the source of intelligibility, and yet to distance God from the\ncreation, without, however, either creating gaps between god and\ncreation or destroying the unity of God. This was the path already\ntaken by Moderatus (Dillon 1977, 348) and later Platonists, such as\nNumenius and Plotinus, who postulated distinct divine hypostases. If\nPlutarch endorsed the view that the Forms exist in the divine soul,\nthis may explain why he sometimes speaks of God and the Forms as a\nunity (e.g.  De sera 550D), and at other times as if they are\nseparate (De an. procr. 1024C-D, Plat. Quest. 1001E;\nHelmig 2005, 24\u20135). The reason may be that sometimes Plutarch\nspeaks of the divine creator in the strict sense, as an intellect, and\nsome other times in the wider sense, as an animated intellect (one in\na soul).  When Plutarch refers to being, the receptacle, and\ngenesis in Timaeus 52d2\u20134, identifying the\nlast with the non-rational soul, the receptacle with matter, and being\nwith the intelligible realm, while he also mentions an intellect\n\u201cabiding and immobile all by itself,\u201d this is not evidence\nthat Plutarch adds arbitrarily a fourth entity, the divine intellect,\nas Cherniss (Plutarch Moralia, Loeb XIII.1, 143)\nargued. Apparently Plutarch understands \u201cbeing\u201d in\nTimaeus 52d2 as equivalent to \u201canimal\u201d in\nTimaeus 39e8, namely as that which comprises both the divine\nintellect (in a soul) and the intelligible Forms.\n4.2 Fate and what is up to us\n\n\nThe antagonism between God and the Indefinite Dyad, between intellect\nand soul, between the rational and the non-rational aspect of the\nworld soul, and ultimately between goodness and badness is an\nentrenched feature of the world, according to Plutarch. He claims that\nthe world contains both goodness and badness and he postulates two\nantithetical principles to account for each one of them (De\nIside 369C\u2013D), since God can only be the principle of\ngoodness (ibid; cf. Republic 379c, Theaetetus\n176a). And he criticizes the Epicureans and the Stoics, who postulate\neither matter (the atoms) or god respectively as active principles of\nthe world (De Iside 369A). Plutarch expresses his dualism\nalso in religious-symbolic terms: he equates the pair of good and evil\nprinciples with the Persian pair of gods Oromazes and Areimanius\n(De Iside 369D\u2013E). Plutarch's pervasive dualism gives\nrise to problems, however. The constant presence and operation of the\ndisorderly, non-rational aspect of the soul in the universe (De\nan. procr. 1027A), implies God's failure totally to\ndominate. Plutarch appears to maintain that God's power is limited by\nthe necessity (anank\u00ea) imposed by matter. Yet, on the\nother hand, he does distinguish between the rule of nature, or fate,\non the one hand, and divine providence on the other, arguing, against\nthe Stoics, that God can dominate nature (De facie 927A-B)\nand can function providentially for us (De comm. not. 1075E,\nDe Iside 371A, De defect oraculorum 413E\n\u2013Ammonius speaking). The fact that God, by means of his\nlogos, with which he is often identified (De Iside\n373A-B), moulds the principle of disorder, the Indefinite Dyad,\nsuggests to Plutarch the supremacy of God over any other force. This\nis actually one of the reasons why Plutarch defends temporal creation;\nif the world were eternal and God responsible for it, then God would\nbe the cause of both good and bad, while on Plutarch's interpretation\nof the Timaeus badness is accounted for by the evil world\nsoul, which, as I said above, according to Plutarch is pre-cosmic (see\nDillon 2002, 234; see also below, sect. 4.3).\n\nThe problem however remains. It becomes more serious if we move from\nthe cosmic macrocosm to the human microcosm. If disorder,\nnon-rationality, and badness are cosmic forces, producing what is bad\nin the world, the question is how they relate to the bad or the vice\ncaused by human beings. Plutarch distinguishes three causes, fate,\nchance, and ourselves as causes of what is up to us, all of which play\na role in what happens to us (Quaest. Conv. 740C-D). The\nfirst two kinds of causes need some explanation in view of Plutarch's\nmetaphysical principles. Presumably, fate amounts to God, chance to\nthe non-rational part of the world soul, since the latter can bring\nabout events not planned by God which are disorderly and evil.\nPlutarch's distinction amounts to three classes of events. Some events\nare fated (or planned by God), some happen by chance (or through the\noperation of the non-rational aspect of the world soul), while there\nis a third class of events for which we, humans, are the only causes\n(De tranq. an. 476E). We can, Plutarch says, decide what to\ndo, how to live our lives, but not how life will turn out in terms of\ndesired or intended outcomes of our actions (ibid. 467A-B; Eliasson\n2008, 130\u2013141). He criticizes the Stoics for violating this\ndistinction, arguing that the Stoic notion of \u201cthat which is up\nto us\u201d coincides with the Stoic notion of fate (De Stoic.\nrepugn. 1056E-D). In view of that evidence Plutarch may appear to\ndefend human freedom, but the problem remains, since it is still\nunclear how the human's participation in the intelligible realm\nthrough soul and intellect, sharing the characteristics of the\n(originally non-rational) world soul and the (naturally rational)\ndivine intellect, shapes one's character and accounts for one's\nactions in life.\n4.3 Theology\n\n\nThe issue of human freedom becomes more complex in view of Plutarch's\nconception of god and his theory of divine providence. This is an\nimportant aspect of Plutarch's philosophy. Plutarch distinguishes\nsharply between God or the divine (theos, to theion) and\ngods, and the question is how the plurality of gods is to be\nunderstood vis-\u00e0-vis the first God. This is not entirely clear\n(Ziegler 1951, 940). Plutarch appears to maintain that the first God\ncan take different names, yet he is to be distinguished from the\ndeities of the Greek pantheon (such as Asclepius in Amatorius\n758A-B), who are to be identified with the lesser gods. In the On\nthe E at Delphi Apollo is presented as the supreme God\n(393D-394A), while elsewhere it is Zeus who is described as the\nsupreme God, creator of the universe (De facie 927B).\nAccording to Plutarch the first God constitutes a unity of utter\nsimplicity, a unity including all divine beings in it (De\nIside 377F), and is identified with the Good and with Being\n(De E 393B\u2013D; see Opsomer 2009,\n158\u2013160). Apparently Plutarch identifies the highest principle\nwith the Form of the Good of the Republic and with the\ndemiurge of the Timaeus (see Ferrari 2005, Brenk 2005), a\ntendency that Numenius and Plotinus will resist later. God rules over\nthe world and provides for it, but being supreme\n(an\u00f4tat\u00f4; Plat. Quest. 1000E),\nfather of gods and men alike, he remains transcendent. This becomes\nclear in Ammonius' speech in On the E in Delphi, where God is\nsaid to be \u201cbeyond everything\u201d (epekeina tou\npantos; 393B), but also in the On the Obsolescence of\nOracles, where Lamprias defends the possibility of God being\nprovident over many worlds, provided that these are of a finite number\n(426E). This means that God is not immanent in the world, and yet he\nis its creator. God's transcendence is maintained by delegating to the\nworld soul some mediatory demiurgic performance (see above, sect. 4.1;\ncf. Opsomer 2005, 94\u20135). This resonates with Plutarch's more\ngeneral view (inspired by Plato), according to which the soul has a\nmediating role between the intellect and the body or sensible reality\n(see below, sect. 5).\n\nApart from the world soul, the creator God also needs some further\nmediation with the sensible world if his transcendence is to be\nmaintained\u2014this is already suggested in the distinction between\nthe demiurge and the lesser gods in the Timaeus\n(42e). Plutarch acknowledges the existence of divine entities inferior\nto the first God or the One but also to gods, namely the\n\u201cdaimones.\u201d They are said to be \u201cby nature\non the boundary between gods and humans\u201d (De\ndef. or. 416C). Placed in the moon, these lesser gods mediate\nbetween the first God and human beings, thus extending God's\nprovidence to them (Dillon 1977, 216\u20138). Plutarch explores a\ntradition going back to Empedocles, to Plato (Symposium\n202d\u2013203e, Phaedo 107D, 113D, Republic 427b,\n620d, Timaeus 90a-d), and to Xenocrates, by whom he appears\nto be particularly influenced on this matter (De Iside 360E,\nDe def. or. 416C\u2013D). The precise role of the demons\nbecomes an interesting issue in view of the fact that Plutarch speaks\nof two kinds of demons, good and bad, and indeed he claims that demons\nexhibit different degrees of virtue and vice, as is the case with men\ntoo (De def. or. 417B, De Iside 360E). Plutarch\nprovides us with evidence according to which the role of demons\nconsists in communicating God's will to humans, bestowing them with\nprophetic powers and inspiration (Amatorius 758E, De\ngenio Socratis 580C, De facie 944C\u2013D), in taking\ncare of humans when they are needy (Amatorius 758A\u2013B),\nin taking care of the sanctuaries and the sacred rites (De\ndef. or. 417A\u2013B), but also in punishing humans and avenging\nhuman bad acts (ibid.). The latter is the role of the bad demons. For\napparently Plutarch maintained that proper punishment is never\nvengeful. This emerges when Plutarch discusses the question of divine\npunishment in his work On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance\n(De sera numinis vindicta).\n\nIn this work Plutarch examines an issue with which philosophers of his\nage are seriously concerned, namely that of theodicy. Even if God is\nnot responsible for occurrences of evil (see above, sect. 4.2), there\nis a question of why these are not always punished promptly by God. In\nhis treatise On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance Plutarch\naddresses the question of whether the delays of divine punishment speak\nagainst the existence of divine providence (550C) and he replies that\nthis is not the case. God, he argues, acts on reason, not on\npassionate anger or impulse (551A, 557E), thus avoiding errors, and by\ndoing so, Plutarch continues, he sets the model for our own actions\n(ibid.). On the other hand, Plutarch argues that human wickedness is\nnot always to be punished, because it of itself ruins the life of\nthose who act thus, and this is already a sufficient punishment\n(ibid. 556D-E). Besides, Plutarch suggests, the punishment of the\ndivine does not have to be obvious; this can actually take place in\nthe afterlife of the soul, as is suggested in Republic 10, so\nPlutarch claims that \u201cit is one and the same argument\n\u2026that establishes both the providence of god and the survival\nof the human soul\u201d (560F; see also below, sect. 5).\n5. Psychology\n\n\nPlutarch, as a Platonist, regards soul as responsible for all life and\nall motion of any kind. The world and all living beings have\nsoul. While in Plato soul sometimes includes (or is even restricted\nto) intellect (e.g. Phaedo 94b) and sometimes not (e.g.\nPhaedrus 247c, Timaeus 69c\u2013e), Plutarch\ndistinguishes sharply between soul and intellect. For Plutarch soul is\nessentially non-rational and yet receptive of reason that stems from\nthe intellect (De virtute morali 441F). Plutarch criticizes\nthe Stoics who analyze the nature of man in two parts only, body and\nsoul, for disregarding the intellect (De facie 943A\u2013B;\nsee Alt 1993, 94\u20136). For Plutarch the threefold distinction of\nthe individual person (body, soul, and intellect) has its equivalent\nin the universe at large. As the human soul is intermediary between\nbody and intellect, similarly, Plutarch claims, the world soul is\nintermediary between earth and sun (De facie 943A, 945A,\nDe virtute morali 441D; see Deuse 1985, 45\u201347, Opsomer\n1994). In both the human being and the world, the intellect is\nexternal to the soul (cf. Phaedrus 247c\u2013d); the world\nsoul is informed by the reason of the creator god, the demiurge, while\nin the case of humans the intellect amounts to the\n\u201cdaim\u00f4n\u201d assigned to each of us (De\ngenio Socratis 591E), which is what Republic 620d and,\nespecially, Timaeus 90a-d suggest. Ultimately both the world\nsoul and the human souls are informed by reason and become rational by\ncoming into contact with the divine intellect. Plutarch argues that\nall ensouled beings, including animals, exhibit the presence of the\ndivine intellect (De Iside 382A\u2013B). However, as I said\nabove (sect. 4.1), an element of non-rationality always remains in\nsouls (De an. procr. 1027A), but Plutarch claims that this\nhappens in different degrees, depending on how much a soul partakes of\nintellect (De genio Socratis 588 D, 591D\u2013E). On this\nbasis Plutarch argues, against the Stoics, that animals also share in\nreason (De sollertia animalium esp. 960B). The extent to\nwhich a soul partakes of reason largely depends on the training and\nthe habits of that soul itself. Strong emotions, for instance,\ndistance soul from intellect and increase its non-rationality (De\ngenio Socratis 591D; see Dillon 1977, 212\u2013213).\n\nPlutarch maintains that there is a constant interaction between\nintellect, soul, and body. This interaction manifests itself both at a\npsychological and at an ethical level. The soul as such accounts for\nthe senses, while the intellect accounts for intelligence (De an.\nprocr. 1026D\u2013E). Clearly, though, perception is an activity\ninvolving both the senses and the notions residing in the intellect\n(see above, sect. 3). It is the intellect that gives order to the\nsense impressions and accounts for understanding. Analogously, the\ninteraction of soul and body gives rise to non-rational movement or\npassion, while the interaction between intellect and soul brings about\nrational movement, harmony and virtue (De sera 566A\u2013D,\n591D\u2013F; see Dillon 1977, 194). Plutarch actually suggests that\nthe soul that is devoid of intellect comes close to being\nquasi-corporeal (De sera 566A; Teodorsson 1994,\n120). Regarding the embodied soul, Plutarch appears to be guided by\nAristotle's view in the De anima (see also Phaedo\n82d\u2013e), arguing that the soul uses the body as an\ninstrument. The soul, he argues, develops faculties, such as the\nvegetative, the nutritive, the perceptive, when associating with the\nbody, so that it can carry out the functions of an animated body\n(De virtute morali 442B, 450E, 451A, Plat. Quest.\n107E\u20131009B; Karamanolis 2006, 111\u2013113, Baltes 2000). This\ncoordination of the body is such that we sense and understand, and\nthis is possible because the soul is informed by the intellect (De\ngenio Socratis 589A).\n\nFor Plutarch, the proximity of soul as such to body in its operations\nas living body is evidence for the superiority of the\nintellect. Inspired by passages in Plato such as Phaedrus\n247c and Timaeus 30b, 90a, Plutarch argues that intellect is\nas superior to soul as soul is to body (De facie 943A). In\nhis view, the intelligent part of the human soul is not subject to\ncorruption (De genio Socratis 591D-F) and Plutarch identifies\nit with one's true self. He argues that one's self is neither that in\nvirtue of which we sense nor that in virtue of which we desire, but\nrather that in virtue of which we reason and think (De facie\n944F\u2013945A; cf. Timaeus 90a-d). Plutarch actually goes\nso far as to distinguish two kinds of death, first when intellect\nleaves soul and body, second when soul leaves body (De facie\n943A\u2013B; see Donini 1988b, 140\u2013143, Brenk 1994, 15). The\nseparation of intellect from soul and body happens \u201cby love for\nthe image of the sun\u2026for which all nature strives\u201d\n(De facie 944E). The ascent to the sun as the goal of\nintellect symbolizes the human being's imitation of, and assimilation\nto, the divine, and is a frequent theme in Plutarch (De Iside\n372D-E, De E 393D\u2013F, De sera 556D; see Brenk\n1994, 10\u201314, Becchi 1997). This is illustrated in the myth\npresented in On Delays in Divine Punishment of a certain\nAridaeus, who like Er in the Republic, died but has come back\nto life to narrate his experience after death. The death of Aridaeus\namounts to the fall of the intelligent part of his soul (to\nphronoun; De sera 563E\u2013F, 566A), through which\nhumans partake of the divine (564C), with the soul remaining behind\n(all\u00ea psych\u00ea) as an anchor in the body (564C;\ncf. 560C-D). The latter is the non-rational part of the soul, which is\nsuch because it is bound to the body\n(s\u00f4matoeid\u00eas; 566A) and inclines the entire soul\ntoward earthly concerns, preventing the soul from going very far away\n(566D). This is very similar to what Plotinus maintains later in\nEnn. IV.8.8.1. However, in his On the Soul that is\nonly fragmentarily preserved, Plutarch speaks of the separation of\nsoul from body and recounts the story of a certain Antyllos who had\ndied and then his soul had been released again (fr. 176 Sandbach). In\nthis context Plutarch claims that the doctrine of the incorruptibility\nof the soul is an ancient one (fr. 177 Sandbach), a claim which may\nwell be a criticism of the Epicurean doctrine of the mortality of soul\n(cf. Non posse suaviter vivi 1103F; see Bonazzi 2010,\n78\u201383). Inspired by the Phaedo, Plutarch argues that\nthe very task of philosophy is to prepare us for the separation from\nthe body, which amounts to a life without bodily needs that he\nconsiders as the \u201ctrue life\u201d, which in his view the\nEpicureans ignore (Non posse suaviter vivi\n1105C\u2013E). After death, Plutarch claims, souls go through the\nprocess of reincarnation, which, as in Plato, is a form of punishment\nfor wicked souls (De sera 567D-F). While all intellects live\neternally, those of noble souls become divine (daimones) and\noperate as guardians of humans (De genio Socratis 593D-594A;\nsee further Dillon 1977, 219\u2013224). Such evidence suggests that\nfor Plutarch both intellect and soul are immortal though in a\ndifferent way, a doctrine we find also later in Porphyry (fr. 453\nSmith).\n6. Ethics and Politics\n\n\nPlutarch shares the view of Hellenistic philosophers that philosophy\nis a way of life. He is much concerned to advocate the life according\nto Plato, and to show that such life is possible and indeed happy (Adv.\nCol. 1107E, Non posse suaviter vivi 1086C-D). He\ncriticizes Stoics and Epicureans for proposing misguided ethical ideals\n(e.g. An recte dictum sit latenter esse vivendum 1129F-1130E).\nPlutarch's strong concern with ethics is reflected also in his\nLives, which focus on the character of a historical figure.\nCentral to these is how man's nature (physis) can be\neducated so that a certain state of character is formed\n(\u00eathos; Pericles 38, Alcibiades 2.1, De\nsera 551E-F, 552C-D; Russell 1973, 105-106, 117). Plutarch's\nespecially strong interest in ethics among the sub-fields of philosophy\nis characteristic of his age. The two most prominent of\nPlutarch's Stoic contemporaries or near-contemporaries, Epictetus\nand Seneca, devote most of their attention in their writings to ethics,\nand this is the case also with the Peripatetic Aristocles of Messene\n(1st c. CE?), the author of some eight books on ethics (Suda\ns.v. Aristocles). To some extent, this especially strong\ninterest in ethics goes back to Antiochus (1st c. BCE).\nPlutarch and the Peripatetic Aristocles identify ethical formation as\nthe ultimate goal of philosophy, yet Plutarch at least differs from Antiochus in\nthat he founds his ethics on metaphysics, largely based on his\ninterpretation of the Timaeus outlined above (sect. 4.1). It is because Plutarch\nmaintains the existence of an intelligible world, which has shaped the\nsensible world including humans, that he rejects the ethics of both\nStoics and Epicureans. On the basis of the Phaedrus and the\nTimaeus, Plutarch maintains that both the human intellect and the\nhuman soul stem from the intelligible realm, the indivisible and the\ndivisible being respectively, which shapes our human nature accordingly\n(cf. Plat. Quest. 1001C).\n\nPlutarch argues that the crucial difference between the Platonic and\nthe Stoic understanding of virtue is grounded in their different\nconceptions of soul as the source of human agency (De virtute\nmorali 441C-E). While for the Stoics soul is reason only,\nPlutarch defends the conception of soul outlined in the\nRepublic (esp. book 4), which presents the soul as consisting\nof rational and non-rational parts. As explained above (sect. 4), this\nfits well with Plutarch's interpretation of the creation of the\nworld, according to which the pre-cosmic non-rational world soul is\ninformed by the reason (logos) of the divine demiurge, yet\nthis is not sufficient to eliminate its natural non-rationality. The\nnon-rational aspect of the human soul accounts for emotions and bodily\ndesires (Opsomer 1994, 41). In fact, however, Plutarch does not lump\ntogether bodily desires and emotions as constituting an\nundifferentiated non-rational part. Given the theory of\nRepublic 4, Plutarch distinguishes spirit, as responsible for\nemotions, from appetite, which is responsible for bodily desires. But he\nclasses them together to the extent that both are dependent upon\nreason, sensitive to, and nurtured by, it (De virtute morali\n443C-D; Plat. Quest. 1008A-B). Plutarch describes virtue\n(without mentioning appetite) as the state in which reason succeeds in\nmanaging emotion and drives it in the right direction (De virtute\nmorali 443B-D, 444B-C, 451C-E), while vice arises when emotion is\nnot properly informed by reason (443D). Plutarch defines virtue as the\nstate in which emotion is present as matter and reason as form (440D),\na definition inspired by Nicomachean Ethics 1104b13\u201330 (cf.\nAspasius, In Ethica Nicomachea 42.20\u201325). Plutarch's\ndefinition of virtue matches his account of how the world came into\nbeing, when matter was informed by reason. As with the world soul,\nsimilarly with the human soul in Plutarch's view, the impact of reason is possible because\nthe soul, or part thereof, can heed what reason dictates.\n\nInterestingly, Plutarch does not refer to the Timaeus to support his theory\nof the tripartite soul, but rather to Aristotle (De virtute morali 442B-C), whom\nPlutarch, like most ancient and modern commentators, recognizes as\nadopting essential aspects of Plato's doctrine. The essential\nfeature that Aristotle shares with Plato is the belief in rational and\nnon-rational aspects of the soul. This accounts for unself-controlled\nactions that, Plutarch thinks, prove how mistaken is the Stoic\nconception of human agency as deriving from reason alone. Plutarch also\nrelies largely on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics with\nregard to the nature of virtue. He describes virtue as being an extreme\nof excellence (akrot\u00eas), which however lies in a mean,\ndetermined by reason, between two opposite emotions (De virtute\nmorali 443D-444D; Nicomachean Ethics 1107a6-8). Plutarch\nargues that there can be no virtue without some emotion. Without some\namount of fear, Plutarch contends, there can be no courage, for\ninstance (De virtute morali 451E-452A); courage, he claims, is the virtue\nthat one acquires when, in a state of fear, one manages to\nsubordinate fear to a goal set by reason, such as fighting for\none's country; in this sense, emotion is an ally to reason in\nconstituting virtue (cf. De tranq. animi 471D). Plutarch\nsuggests this specifically in the case of anger becoming bravery\n(De ira fr. 148 Sandbach). Anger, when moderated and guided by\nreason, can also motivate reasonable and due vengeance (De\nsera 551A-B).\n\nSince virtue is the state (hexis 443D) in which emotion is\nguided by reason, it follows that virtue requires training in how to\nmake emotion right. Plutarch devotes an entire treatise to that\nsubject (De profectibus in virtute). He defends, against the\nStoics, the view that progress in virtue is possible (ignoring the\nrelevant views of Epictetus, Dissertations I.4 and Seneca,\nLetters to Lucilius 75.8). Education in virtue can be\nprovided by parents and teachers, by the example of the virtuous\nactions of the people around us (De communibus notitiis\n1069A), by the law of the cities (De virtute morali 452D),\nand also by philosophy, poetry and history (De profectibus\n79B-80B). Plutarch tries indeed to offer such an education in virtue\nthrough his writings that have practical orientation, such as On\nthe Control of Anger, On Curiosity, How Could you Tell a Flatterer\nfrom a Friend, Precepts of Marriage, To an Uneducated Ruler (see\nVan Hoof 2010), which are similar in spirit with the works of\nPhilodemus On Property Management, On the Good Ruler according to\nHomer and Seneca's Letters to Lucilius. Plutarch\nmaintains that the pervasion of emotion by reason should be thorough,\nwhich is why he claims that the temperate person is less virtuous than\nthe practically wise one (phronimos), who does the good\nwithout wavering (De virtute morali 445C-D;\ncf. Nicomachean Ethics 1151b23\u20131152a3), as a temperate\nperson might. To the extent that virtue reflects the operation of\nreason in the human soul, which is capable of following reason,\nvirtue, Plutarch argues, is natural to us. He argues that nature\nitself attracts us (oikeiousa) to things which are natural\nfor us to strive for, but these include also life, health, beauty,\nwhich Plutarch considers as completing happiness\n(sympl\u00earotika, De communibus notitiis\n1060B-E). Plutarch censures the Stoics because they argue that the\nfinal human end is to live in accordance with nature, but, he claims,\nthey contradict themselves when they admit only virtue as being good,\nneglecting all other things which are, by everyone's admission, good\nfor us, such as health. Plutarch, like Antiochus, maintains that the\nhuman final end includes the satisfaction of primary demands of the\nbody, a doctrine Plutarch finds in Aristotle, Xenocrates and Polemo\n(De communibus notitiis 1069E-F).\n\nThis, however, is not the only conception of happiness that Plutarch\nadvocates. While he argues against the Stoics that a life of thinking\nonly, devoid of all affection, cannot be happy (De tranq.\nanimi 468D), he also defends an alternative end for human life,\nwhich consists in a life of theoria (an Aristotelian term\nmeaning contemplative knowing) or, in Plutarch's words,\nepopteia (a religious term referring to the final vision\nachieved in initiation ceremonies for mystery religions; De\nIside 382D-E; cf. Quaestiones Convivales\n718d). Formally, the end that Plutarch advocates for human beings is,\nas he says, a life similar to god (De sera 550D-E). This end\nis suggested in the several eschatological stories found in Plutarch's\nwork, which suggest that a human being can transcend the sensible\nworld and become united with the divine (see Alt 1993,\n185\u2013204). This doctrine, which has its roots in the\nPhaedo, the Theaetetus and Republic X, is\nagain to be understood against Plutarch's interpretation of the\ncosmogony of the Timaeus. The \u201cyounger gods\u201d of\nthe Timaeus imitate the demiurge in constructing human\nbeings' and the other animals' bodies and souls (40b-d, 42e), and this\nis also the case with nature, which strives to imitate the creator and\nbecome like him (De facie 944; Helmig 2005,\n21\u201323). This assimilation with god (homoi\u00f4sis)\namounts to the complete domination of the intelligible aspect of\nhumans over the sensible one. Humans are invited to follow the cosmic\nexample and in this sense to live in accordance with nature too. To\nachieve this, one should let his intellect rule and get beyond having\nany emotions.  This amounts to having and exercising theoretical\nvirtue alone, which pertains to the intellect (Non posse suaviter\nvivi 1092E). The practical virtues that pertain to the embodied\nsoul are achieved, according to Plutarch, through the subordination of\nemotion to reason (Tyrwitt frs. p. 68 Sandbach). Plutarch's\ndistinction between a life of happiness through theorizing or\ncontemplation and a practical life of happiness is made in his On\nMoral Virtue, apparently inspired by the relevant Aristotelian\ndistinction in Nicomachean Ethics. Plutarch suggests that his\ntheoretical ideal does not only require a distinct kind of virtue but\nalso determines a distinct kind of happiness. In this Plutarch\nanticipates Plotinus' distinction of two kinds of ethical life, a\npolitical and a theoretical one. For Plutarch, however, the\ntheoretical ideal of the philosopher involves a political dimension\ntoo, which is to help their fellow citizens and the city with his\nreasoning, as is suggested in the Republic, and he criticizes\nboth Stoics and Epicureans for refusing to engage in politics (De\nStoic. rep.  1033A\u20131034C, Adv. Col.\n1126B\u20131127E, Ad Princ. Inerud. 780C\u2013F).\n7. Poetics and Educational theory\n\n\nGiven Plutarch's concern for the education of character and of the\ncity as a whole, it is hardly surprising that he wrote works on\neducation (On the Education of Children, De liberis\neducandis, which is considered spurious, however, by Ziegler\n1951, 809\u2013812) and especially on the effect that poetry has on\nthe education of one's character. His most important work in this\nfield is On How the Young Man Should Listen to Poets\n(Quomodo adolscens poetas audire debeat; De aud. poet.),\nwhile he also wrote a treatise on Homer (De Homero) that is\nno loner extant. In the former work Plutarch deals with the question\nof how young people should read and understand poetry, since poetry\ncan be both beneficial and harmful, depending on its\ninterpretation. Following the Republic, Plutarch argues that\npoetry is a mimetic art; it imitates the character and lives of\nvarious people, good and bad alike (De aud. poet. 17E-F,\n26A). In the course of this, Plutarch claims, poets tell lies and\npresent obscene stories and images (ibid. 16A). Plutarch selects\nexamples of such poetic habits mainly from the Republic,\nfocusing on stories from Homer in particular. Plutarch does not\ncondemn poetry altogether; he rather finds a convenient middle\nsolution. He tries to show how one should read the poets in the most\nbeneficial way. In order to do so, Plutarch argues, first one should\navoid reading the deliberate lies made in poetry, which can\nunnecessarily upset one (ibid. 17B; see Russell 1989, 303). Second,\nPlutarch recommends that the reader, especially the young one, should\nlearn how to read poetry allegorically, in such a way that this can\nhave a beneficial effect on one's character (ibid.  19E-20B; see Lamberton\n2001, 48-50). This is the approach that Plutarch himself applies to\nthe myth of Isis and Osiris in his work with that title. Plutarch\nillustrates the search for the correct (morally uplifting) meaning of\na poetic saying also in parts of the Table Talks\n(Quaestiones Conviviales 622C, 673C; see Russell 1989, 305). The\nyoung man needs to learn the skill of how to recover and isolate the\nbeneficial elements of poetry and absorb them alone. In that way\npoetry can guide one to virtue (ibid. 28E-F). Plutarch likens properly\neducated young men in their attitude towards poetry to the way bees\nselect the best from flowers (32E), a simile adopted by the\nChristians, Basil (To young men on the right use of\nliterature 4.7\u20138), and Gregory of Nazianzus\n(Orationes 43.13.1). Such a use of poetry, Plutarch claims,\nprepares youths for their education in philosophy (De\naud. poet. 15F, 37B). This happens in two ways.  First, poetry\ncan guide youths towards philosophy by familiarizing them with the\nconcepts that philosophers also use; second, poetry, as we have seen,\nwhen properly used, can guide to virtue, and this, Plutarch argues, is\na requirement for philosophical education (De aud.\npoet. 36D-37B). Plutarch actually maintains that the best of\npoetry is nothing other than philosophy in disguise (ibid. 15F), and\nthroughout his work he tries to illustrate precisely this through a\nselection of verses from the most well known ancient poets. In On\nMaking Progress in Virtue (79B-D) Plutarch goes so far as to\ntreat poetry and history as complementary to philosophy in educating\none's character. Regarding the educative role of poetry, Plutarch\nappears to be influenced by the Stoics, who were using poetry in\neducation, but he goes further than they in devising specific\nstrategies meant to turn young men into good readers of poetry (see\nBlank 2011).\n\nFrom this point of view, one may relate Plutarch's Lives to\nhis philosophical works (see Gill 2006, 421\u2013424). Plutarch\nhimself says he wrote the Lives for the improvement of\nothers, assuming that the actions of virtue will instigate emulation\nin the reader (Pericles 1\u20132; see Russell 1973,\n100\u2013101). Perhaps, then, the Lives also aim to train\nthe reader's character, and in such a way to prepare them for the life\nof philosophy. If this is the case, then the Lives are\ncomplementary with Plutarch's ethical works of practical orientation\nthat I discuss in the previous section.\n8. Influence\n\n\nPlutarch exercised considerable influence on later Platonism. His\nemphasis on the Timaeus and on metaphysics and psychology set\nthe tone for the following generations of Platonists, in which\nmetaphysical and psychological questions and the high authority of the\nTimaeus were prominent features of philosophical\ninquiry. Plutarch's literal interpretation of the Timaeus\nitself was highly debated among Platonists. It was adopted by Atticus,\nbut was resisted by most others, including Taurus, Porphyry and\nProclus. Later Platonists criticized Plutarch for a narrow-minded\ninterpretation of the Timaeus, some of their criticisms\n(e.g. on the world soul), however, rest on an uncharitable\ninterpretation of Plutarch (see Opsomer 2001). Nevertheless,\nPlutarch's view that the world soul is created in the sense that it\npartakes of reason and intelligence imparted to it by the demiurge, is\nendorsed by Alcinous, Didascalikos 169.33\u201342 and\npresumably also by Numenius (fr. 45 Des Places; see Dillon 1993, 127).\nPlutarch's radical metaphysical and psychological dualism is shared by\nNumenius and Atticus, but is rejected by Plotinus and Porphyry. The\nlatter, however, draws on Plutarch in his argument that animals\npartake of reason (De abstinentia 3.6\u20137).  Plutarch's\ntheory of divine providence and theodicy, as presented in his On\nDelays of the Divine Providence (De sera numinis\nvindicta) was influential among ancient Platonists and Christians\nalike. Proclus, for instance, took over much from it in his Ten\nObjections Against Divine Providence (esp. 8 and 9). Despite the\nvagaries of judgment by later Platonists of Plutarch's work, Plutarch\nnot only set the agenda of questions for later Platonists, redirecting\ntheir attention to the Timaeus, but he was also influential\nin terms of his interpretative strategy in approaching Plato's\nwritings, which aspired to take into account Plato's entire work and\nto treat it as a system still to be articulated. It is this strategy\nthat leads Plutarch to distinguish hierarchies of being in Plato's\nwork and also levels of ethical life, a strategy that Plotinus will\nadopt and develop. Plutarch was highly influential also among early\nChristians, who approved of his literal interpretation of the\nTimaeus, of his theory of good and bad demons, and of his\neducational theory. His work was used by Clement of Alexandria, who\nfollowed Plutarch in writing a treatise with the title\n\u201cStromateis,\u201d but also by Eusebius, Cyril of Alexandria\nand the Cappadocean Church Fathers, especially Basil (see above,\nsect. 7).\n",
