    "main_text": "Noetics \u2014 Epistemology and Psychology || Identity of the Intellect and what is intellected\n4.5 Identity of the Intellect and what is intellected\n\nCritical to presential knowledge is the Porphyrian doctrine of the\nunity of the intellect, the intellecting subject and its intelligible\nobject. Pure self-knowledge for Plotinus depends on union with the\ndivine intellect that self-intellects. Such a noetic experience is\nnon-discursive.\n\nAvicenna strongly criticises this doctrine (Avicenna 1996, III:\n292\u201393; Avicenna 1959: 239\u201340). One thing cannot become\nanother substantially, nor can a rational soul unite with the Active\nIntellect which is indivisible. The human intellect cannot be united\nwith intelligibilia. Rather one knows things by conjunction\n(ittisal) not union (ittihad) with the Active\nIntellect from whence one grasps the universals of things immanent in\nit. The soul receives the forms from the Active intellect but remains\nunchanged itself. The forms inhere in the soul-intellect through the\nmaterial intellect. Avicenna criticises Porphyry for popularising the\nfallacy of union and change. But in doing so Avicenna marks a sharp\ndistinction between God\u2019s knowledge and human knowledge.\nAccording to Mulla Sadra, one cannot hold such a view about\nGod\u2019s knowledge because it violates both His unity and the fact\nof His knowledge of particulars.\n\nMulla Sadra\u2019s criticism of Avicenna is predicated upon two\ncentral doctrines of his that are intimately linked to the hermeneutic\nof modulation. First, the primacy (and modulation) of existence proves\nthis union.\n\nExistence in everything is foundational\u2026It is the principle of\nindividuality (mabda\u2019 al-shakhsiyya) and the source of\nthe essence of the thing. Existence can become more intense and become\nweaker, it can become more perfect and it can become imperfect, yet\nthe individual remains who he is (al-shakhs huwa huwa). Do\nyou not see that the human from his beginning as a foetus to the end\nof his being intellects and is intellected while his contexts and\nsituations change yet the mode of his existence and his individuality\nremain constant (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, III: 351).\n\n\nSecond, the doctrine of (trans-)substantial motion defends union. The\nsoul is in motion as \u2018pure act\u2019 (fi\u2018liyya).\nFurther, union is not a substantial or even conceptual one but an\nepistemic and referential union in which the components \u2018become\none existent insofar as a single intelligible notion refers to\nit.\u2019 The ultimate nature of knowledge, like existence, does not\ndistinguish strictly between the divine and human. Multiplicity in the\nintellect does not entail multiplicity in God because these\nintelligibilia are correlated as \u2018illuminative\nrelations\u2019. Being-intellecting and being-intellected are\ncorrelatives that cannot exist independently.\n\nThe simple intellect (that is God) knows all things since all things\nare present in it and it is the ultimate referent for all concepts.\nThis is the \u2018internality thesis\u2019, that all intelligibilia\nare internal to intellect and the objects of sense perception are\nexternal. Our philosopher strongly criticises Avicenna for holding the\nconcept of the simple intellect (which for Avicenna is simple\ncognition that is non-discursive and without recourse to forms) whilst\ndenying the union of the intellecting subject and its object.\nFurthermore, for the Peripatetic tradition, the human intellect in\nthis life cannot attain the level of the pure simple intellect. Mulla\nSadra refutes this:\n\nIf the simple intellect (al-\u2018aql al-basit) (which he\nbelieves exists in the human species and in separable substances) is\nnot [all] intelligibilia, then how can souls benefit from\nwhat does not occur in them? How can souls move from potentiality to\nactuality from what is not in them? (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, III:\n405)\n\n\nThe mode of the existence of things in this simple intellect is known\nas \u2018the thing (or fact) itself\u2019 (nafs al-amr) or\nthe immanent object. This simple and higher intellect is not\nabstracted but contains all lower and complex forms and degrees of\nexistence. It is in this sense that this nous is a\n\u2018unity-in-plurality\u2019. It is also the Aristotelian active\nintellect of De Anima III.5.\n\nBut how does one safeguard individuality and the ontological\ndistinction of man and God? The solution is through the concept of\nintelligibility and forms. All intelligibilia and forms exist\nin the simple/active intellect in potentia, but their\nactualisations are individual existents extrinsic to the intellect.\nThe Active intellect is thus the referent for the predication of\nintelligibilia. This union does not dissolve the individual\nexistence of intellects.\n\nThe intellect is all things intelligible. This does not mean that it\nis all those things in their extra-mental individual modes of\nexistence collected together as this is impossible. Rather it means\nthat all essences that exist in extra-mental reality through many\ndifferent existences exist in the intellect through multiple\nintelligible existences in a singular intelligible existence that in\nits unity and simplicity is all those meanings (Mulla Sadra\n2001\u20135, III: 365).\n\n\nTrue knowledge resides therefore in uniting with the Active Intellect.\nDistinction within this realm is by modulation, by varying motion and\nlights upon lights in order of nobility. In this model of knowledge,\nthere is pure self-reflexivity, no doxa about forms and no\nepist\u0113m\u0113 about sensibilia. It is a form of\ninfallibilism. One cannot mistake state A for state\nB since one must first cognise state A. But is this\nform of knowledge useful and does it communicate? Or it is merely\nineffable like so many beliefs and feelings that are important to the\nway we live our lives. In the simple intellect one knows things at\nonce. Thus for a proposition A, we do not know S\nfirst and then P but both simultaneously. But the content of\nthe simple intellect unlike Avicenna\u2019s account is not different\nto the discursive dianoic intellect. S and P are\ncontents of A whether one knows A simply or\ndiscursively. This deals with one of the famous objections to\nnon-propositional thought in Plotinus, that of entailing\nnon-complexity. What is required is an adequate metalanguage of such\nexperience since one can and does talk about such knowledge. One can\nforge a linguistic discipline to discuss it but the presential\nknowledge involved is not informational and cannot be grounds for\npublic knowledge but indicators for initiates. The immediacy,\ninfallibility and successful cognition of presential knowledge\nprivileges it over other epistemological models.\n",
