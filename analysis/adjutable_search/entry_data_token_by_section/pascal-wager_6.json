Now perhaps this is an\nanalytic truth, in which case we could grant it to Pascal without\nfurther discussion\u2014perhaps it is constitutive of\nrationality to maximize expectation, as some might say. But this\npremise has met serious objections. The Allais 1953 and Ellsberg 1961\nparadoxes, for example, are said to show that maximizing expectation\ncan lead one to perform intuitively sub-optimal actions. So too the\nSt. Petersburg paradox, in which it is supposedly absurd that one\nshould be prepared to pay any finite amount to play a game with\ninfinite expectation. (That paradox is particularly apposite\n here.)[10]\n\nVarious refinements of expected utility theory have been suggested as\na result of such problems. For example, we might consider expected\ndifferences between the pay-offs of options, and prefer one\noption to another if and only if the expected difference of the former\nrelative to the latter is positive\u2014see H\u00e1jek and Nover\n2006, H\u00e1jek 2006, Colyvan 2008, and Colyvan & H\u00e1jek\n2016. Or we might consider suitably defined utility ratios,\nand prefer one option to another if and only if the utility ratio of\nthe former relative to the latter is greater than 1\u2014see Bartha\n2007. If we either admit refinements of traditional expected utility\ntheory, or are pluralistic about our decision rules, then premise 3 is\napparently false as it stands. Nonetheless, the door is opened to some\nsuitable reformulation of it that might serve Pascal\u2019s purposes.\nIndeed, Bartha argues that his ratio-based reformulation answers some\nof the most pressing objections to the Wager that turn on its\ninvocation of infinite utility.\n\nFinally, one might distinguish between practical rationality\nand theoretical rationality. One could then concede that\npractical rationality requires you to maximize expected utility, while\ninsisting that theoretical rationality might require something else of\nyou\u2014say, proportioning belief to the amount of evidence\navailable. This objection is especially relevant, since Pascal admits\nthat perhaps you \u201cmust renounce reason\u201d in order to follow\nhis advice. But when these two sides of rationality pull in opposite\ndirections, as they apparently can here, it is not obvious that\npractical rationality should take precedence. (For a discussion of\npragmatic, as opposed to theoretical, reasons for belief, see Foley\n1994.)\n",
