    "main_text": "Physical Creation\n3. Physical Creation\n\nIn the first step of the Journey Bonaventure focuses upon the\nsensible objects of the physical world around us, both taken in\nthemselves and in reference to our sense awareness of them. Like all\ncreatures, sensible things are understood to be signs that ultimately\ncan direct humans to the divine art or wisdom through which all things\nhave been made. Bonaventure\u2019s semiotics distinguishes four sorts\nof signs. All creatures can be seen as \u201cshadows\u201d\n(umbra) and \u201cvestiges\u201d (lit. footprints,\nvestigia):\n\n\nFor a creature is called a shadow based on its properties which point\nto God in some type of causality in an indeterminate way. But a\ncreature is called a vestige based on properties which point to God as\ntriple cause\u2014efficient, formal, and final cause; for example,\nthe properties: one, true, and good. (In I Sent. d. 3, pars\n1, q. 2, ad 4 [Quaracchi I: 73b], trans. Houser and Noone, 77\u201378)\n\n\nIn addition, Bonaventure posits two higher types of semiosis pertinent\nsolely to rational creatures, which are \u201cimages\u201d\n(imago) pointing to the First Principle through its properly\nrational powers which have their source and highest object in God and\n\u201clikenesses\u201d (similitudo) of God to the extent\nthat they are recipients of divine grace and conform themselves to the\ndivine will. All creatures, from rocks to angels, are signs in the\nsense of shadows and traces of God, for they all bear a relation of\ncausal dependency upon God as their source; but only rational\ncreatures can have the divine as an object of their activities and,\nfor that reason, can conform themselves to the divine will and become\nlikenesses of God.\n",
