    "main_text": "\n\nJacques Marie \u00c9mile Lacan (April 13, 1901 to September 9, 1981)\nwas a major figure in Parisian intellectual life for much of the\ntwentieth century. Sometimes referred to as \u201cthe French\nFreud,\u201d he is an important figure in the history of\npsychoanalysis. His teachings and writings explore the significance of\nFreud\u2019s discovery of the unconscious both within the theory and\npractice of analysis itself as well as in connection with a wide range\nof other disciplines. Particularly for those interested in the\nphilosophical dimensions of Freudian thought, Lacan\u2019s\noeuvre is invaluable. Over the course of the past fifty-plus\nyears, Lacanian ideas have become central to the various receptions of\nthings psychoanalytic in Continental philosophical circles\nespecially.\n",
