But the topic of international relations\nmay not simply be a problem of extension, that is, it may not simply\nbe a question of whether some existing account of public reason can be\nextended to provide the necessary answers to questions about\ninternational relations or global justice. There is also the further\nquestion as to whether the principles that regulate international or\nglobal justice require an independent or separate conception of global\npublic reason. The case in favor of a distinct account of global\npublic reason might appeal to at least three facts. First, if the\nfundamental ideas that form the basis of \u201cdomestic\u201d public\nreason draw on the shared public or political culture of a\nconstitutional democracy (Rawls 1999b, 584), global public reason\nappears to require a different basis, since either there is no shared\npolitical culture spanning the globe, or else that shared culture\nlooks very different to that of a constitutional democracy. Second, if\nthe relevant agents in the global or international arena are not\nprimarily individual persons, but are rather states or other\ncollective entities, then global public reason may require a very\ndifferent conception of the constituency of public reason. Third, and\nrelatedly, if we assume that a global society regulated by a\nconception of global public reason is comprised of different states,\nwhich are each internally regulated by their own domestic forms of\npublic reason, we face several questions regarding the relationship\nbetween these domestic and global principles, for example, can these\nprinciples come into conflict, and if so, how do we adjudicate such\nconflicts? Each of these assumptions, however, is open to dispute, and\nthus some might plausibly insist that there is no need for a distinct\naccount of global public reason.\n\nAlthough the topic of global justice has been the subject of much\nrecent philosophical attention, comparatively little recent work has\nfocused on the idea of a global public reason, with some notable\nexceptions (Cohen 2010, 319\u2013372; Porter 2012; Rawls 1999b,\n529\u2013564; Smith 2011; Wenar 2008; J. Williams 2017).\n",
