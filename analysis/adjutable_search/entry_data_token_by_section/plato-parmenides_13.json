Within D2 there are thirty-three separate Arguments\nwith the following Conclusions: If the one is, then the one partakes\nof being (D2A1C1), the one is not the same as being (D2A1C2), the one\nis a whole (D2A2C1), being and the one are parts of the one (D2A2C2),\nthe one is infinitely many (D2A3C and D2A5C), the different is not the\nsame as the one (D2A4C1), the different is not the same as being\n(D2A4C2), the one has parts (D2A6C1), the one is a whole (D2A6C2), the\none is limited (D2A6C3), the one is unlimited (D2A6C4), the one has a\nbeginning, a middle, and an end (D2A7C1), the one has shape (D2A7C2),\nthe one is in itself (D2A8C1), the one is not nowhere (D2A8C2), the\none is in another (D2A8C3), the one is at rest (D2A9C1), the one is in\nmotion (D2A9C2), the one is the same as itself (D2A10C1), the one is\ndifferent from itself (D2A10C2), the one is different from the others\n(D2A11C), the one is the same as the others (D2A12C), the one is like\nthe others (D2A13C and D2A15C1), the one is unlike the others (D2A14C\nand D2A15C2), the one is like itself (D2A16C1), the one is unlike\nitself (D2A16C2), the one touches itself (D2A17C1), the one touches\nthe others (D2A17C2), the one does not touch itself (D2A18C), the one\ndoes not touch the others (D2A19C), the one is equal to itself\n(D2A20C1), the one is equal to the others (D2A20C2), the one is both\ngreater than and less than itself (D2A21C1), the one is unequal to\nitself (D2A21C2), the one is both greater than and less than the\nothers (D2A22C1), the one is unequal to the others (D2A22C2), the one\nis more than, less than, and equal to itself in number (D2A23C1), the\none is more than, less than, and equal to the others in number\n(D2A23C2), the one partakes of time (D2A24C), the one comes to be\nolder than itself (D2A25C1), the one comes to be younger than itself\n(D2A25C2), the one always is older than itself (D2A26C1), the one\nalways is younger than itself (D2A26C2), the one is the same age as\nitself (D2A27C1), the one is neither older nor younger than itself\n(D2A27C2), the one neither comes to be older nor comes to be younger\nthan itself (D2A27C3), the one is older than the others (D2A28C), the\none is younger than the others (D2A29C), the one is the same age as\nthe others (D2A30C1), the one is neither older nor younger than the\nothers (D2A30C2), the one neither comes to be older nor comes to be\nyounger than the others (D2A31C), the one comes to be younger than the\nothers (D2A32C1), the one comes to be older than the others (D2A32C2),\nthe one partakes of time past, future, and present (D2A33C1), the one\nis and comes to be, was and was coming to be, and will be and will be\ncoming to be (D2A33C2), and the one could be named and spoken of, as\nwell as be the object of an account, knowledge, perception, and\nopinion (D2A33C3).\n\n\nMost of the individual Arguments in D2 are logically\ninterconnected. The exceptions are D2A1C1, D2A1C2, D2A8C2,\nD2A10C1, D2A12C, D2A18C, D2A19C, D2A20C1, D2A20C2, and D2A24C, which do\nnot depend on any previously established conclusions. (For\ndetails, see Rickless (2007, 138\u2013187).)\n\n\nIt appears that every Argument of D2 is logically valid.\n(However, see Gill (1996, 64, n. 107), who contends that D2A8 and D2A9\nare fallacious, and Patterson (1999, 98\u2013100), who argues that D2A8 is\nfallacious.)) Like the Arguments of D1, the Arguments of D2 rest\non a large number of independent premises, including many of the\nindependent premises of D1. Again, most of these premises are, at\nleast from Plato\u2019s point of view, either definitionally true or\nself-evident. (Gill (1996, 83\u201384) objects to one of the premises\nof D2A14 and Patterson objects to one of the premises of D2A28, but\nRickless (2007, 160 and 175) claims that it is unclear whether Plato\nhimself would have found these premises problematic.) There are\nthree exceptions to this claim: D2A4, D2A12, and D2A14. D2A4\ndepends on Causality and No Causation by Contraries, D2A12 depends on\nNo Causation by Contraries, and D2A14C depends on D2A12C. But\nthere are reasons for thinking that No Causation by Contraries is\nfalse. When combined with Causality, No Causation by Contraries\nentails that, for any property F, the F cannot be con-F. But,\nassuming that the one is, this contradicts D2A3C, namely that\nif the one is, then the one is (infinitely) many. So, if\nCausality is true and the one is, then No Causation by Contraries must\nbe false. This result is important, for the falsity of No\nCausation by Contraries would enable Plato to dispatch at least some of\nParmenides\u2019 earlier criticisms of the theory of forms, notably\nthe first two criticisms of the result of combining the theory of forms\nwith the Piece-of-Pie Model conception of partaking\u2014see the end\nof section 4.2 above.\n\n\nNotice that D1 and D2 together entail that if the one is, then\nPurity-F is false. To see why, consider the following. D1 establishes\nthat if Purity-F is true, then if the one is, then the one is\nneither F nor con-F; and D2 establishes that if the\none is, then the one is both F and con-F. So if both\nD1 and D2 are valid and based on acceptable premises (other than\nPurity-F), then D1 and D2 together establish that if Purity-F is true\nand the one is, then the one has\ncontradictory properties. Given that it is impossible\nfor something to have contradictory properties, it is a direct\nconsequence of the conjunction of D1 and D2 that if the one is, then\nPurity-F is false.\n",
