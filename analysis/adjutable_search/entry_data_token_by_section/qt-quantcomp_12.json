    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions || Experimental Metaphysics?\n5.2 Experimental Metaphysics?\n\nThe quantum information revolution has prompted several physicists and\nphilosophers to claim that new insights can be gained from the rising\nnew science into conceptual problems in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics (see, e.g., Bub (2016), Chiribella and Spekkens (2016); for\nresponses and commentaries, see, e.g., Myrvold (2010), Timpson (2013),\nFelline (2016), Cuffaro (forthcoming), Duwell (forthcoming), Felline\n(forthcoming-a), Henderson (forthcoming), Koberinski and M\u00fcller\n(2018)). Yet while one of the most famous foundational problems in\nquantum mechanics, namely\n the quantum measurement problem,\n remains unsolved even within quantum information theory (see Hagar\n (2003), Hagar and Hemmo (2006), and Felline (forthcoming-b) for a\n critique of the quantum information theoretic approach to the\n foundations of quantum mechanics and the role of the quantum\n measurement problem in this context), some quantum information\n theorists dismiss it as a philosophical quibble (Fuchs 2002). Indeed,\n in quantum information theory the concept of\n \u201cmeasurement\u201d is taken as a primitive, a \u201cblack\n box\u201d which remains unanalysed. The measurement problem itself,\n furthermore, is regarded as a misunderstanding of quantum theory. But\n recent advances in the realisation of a large scale quantum computer\n may eventually prove quantum information theorists wrong: Rather than\n supporting the dismissal of the quantum measurement problem, these\n advances may surprisingly lead to its empirical solution.\n\nThe speculative idea is the following. As it turns\nout, collapse theories\u2014one form of\nalternatives to quantum theory which aim to solve the measurement\nproblem\u2014modify Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation and give\ndifferent predictions from quantum theory in certain specific\ncircumstances. These circumstances can be realised, moreover,\nif decoherence effects can be\nsuppressed (Bassi, Adler, & Ippoliti 2004). Now one of the most\ndifficult obstacles that await the construction of a large scale\nquantum computer is its robustness against decoherence effects (Unruh\n1995). It thus appears that the technological capabilities required\nfor the realisation of a large scale quantum computer are potentially\nrelated to those upon which the distinction between \u201ctrue\u201d\nand \u201cfalse\u201d collapse (Pearle 1997), i.e., between collapse\ntheories and environmentally induced decoherence, is\ncontingent. Consequently the physical realisation of a large-scale\nquantum computer, if it were of the right architecture, could\npotentially shed light on one of the long standing conceptual problems\nin the foundations of the theory, and if so this would serve as yet\nanother example of experimental metaphysics (the term was coined by\nAbner Shimony to designate the chain of events that led\nfrom the EPR argument\nvia Bell\u2019s theorem to\nAspect\u2019s experiments). Note, however, that as just mentioned,\none would need to consider the computer\u2019s architecture before\nmaking any metaphysical conclusions. The computer architecture is\nimportant because while dynamical collapse theories tend to collapse\nsuperpositions involving the positions of macroscopic quantities of\nmass, they tend not to collapse large complicated superpositions of\nphoton polarisation or spin.\n",
