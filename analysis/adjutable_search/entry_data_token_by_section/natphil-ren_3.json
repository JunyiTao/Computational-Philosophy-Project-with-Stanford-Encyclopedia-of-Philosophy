Revising the Curriculum: Academies, Philology, and Botanical Gardens\n\nOutside of universities and schools, there were also other places\nwhere natural philosophy was cultivated, particularly in academies and\nlearned societies. Even in literary societies such as the\nAccademia Fiorentina (1541), patronized by Duke Cosimo\nde\u2019Medici and his descendants, scientific matters (e.g., alchemy\nor spontaneous generation) were occasionally debated, often in the\ncontext of commentaries on the poems of Dante and Petrarch. The\nAccademia dei Lincei, founded in 1603, on the other hand, was\nexclusively interested in the sciences: as their statute dictated, the\nLincei had no interest in any controversy which was not\nscientific or mathematical, and they avoided involvement in political\nmatters. The Accademia dei Lincei, like the Accademia del\nCimento after it (1657), was founded and patronized by members of\nthe aristocracy, but never became as well-grounded as other learned\nsocieties, such as the Royal Society (1661) or the Acad\u00e9mie\nRoyale (1666), which were directly sponsored by the state (the\nAcad\u00e9mie Royale even received financial support from\nthe treasury). Both of these latter institutions developed out of more\ninformal associations and they encouraged collaboration among their\nmembers; they also explicitly endorsed the open and public exchange of\nideas, as opposed to the secretive practices of groups like the\nLincei. Their members gave public demonstrations of their\nwork, and the secrecy which had characterized scientific pursuit for\ncenturies was eventually abandoned in favor of a new empirical\napproach.\n\nNonetheless, even when they did not sponsor academies, Renaissance\nlords and patrons often had a particular interest in scientific works\nand treatises, especially those devoted to subjects of military value\n(such as the works on metalworking by Vannoccio Biringuccio and George\nAgricola, or Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia\u2019s treatise on ballistics,\nin the mid-sixteenth century), or booklets dedicated to parva\nnaturalia, which were intended as forms of intellectual\nentertainment and usually contained descriptions of miranda\nnaturae or astrological predictions. Exceptional natural events\nsuch as earthquakes\u2014a famous one occurred in Pozzuoli in\n1537\u2014led to the publication of a number of short treatises that\ninterpreted the calamity as either a natural phenomenon or as a sign\nsent by the celestial influences: these works were particularly sought\nafter by powerful men, who wanted to be reassured about the\nsignificance of natural events and their possible consequences.\nSeveral Renaissance rulers cultivated an interest in sciences like\nalchemy, and patronized or participated first-hand in investigations\nof the natural world: disciplines like zoology, which depended on the\ncollection of material, information, and drawings, relied particularly\nheavily on the sponsorship of the wealthy and powerful. The zoological\nand botanical works and catalogues which, though composed by\nuniversity professors, started from the 1540s to circulate around\nEurope, were often addressed to or sponsored by rulers, who had the\nmeans to employ artists and other specialists needed to complete these\ncostly volumes. Drawings were not simply ornaments to a text, but a\nnecessity for accurate classification of plants and animals.\n\nThe same desire for accuracy that motivated the production of\nscientific images also led to more rigorous editions and translations\nof classic scientific texts, whose impact was magnified by the\nprinting press. Between 1495 and 1498 Aldus Manutius printed the\n\u201cGreek Aristotle\u201d in Venice, an edition prepared by a team\nwhich included the humanist-physicians Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno and\nThomas Linacre under the guidance of another physician, Francesco\nCavalli. Consequently, Manutius\u2019s edition, which incorporated\nsignificant improvements of the Aristotelian texts such as those\nproposed years before by Theodor Gaza for the Historia\nAnimalium, favored the scientific works by Aristotle and did not\ninclude, for example, either Rhetoric or Poetics.\nYet the scientific text that received the most attention from\nphilologists was Pliny\u2019s Natural History. Between the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries Pliny\u2019s work was emended by\nphilologists such as Ermolao Barbaro, Angelo Poliziano, and\nNiccol\u00f2 Leoniceno\u2014and also translated several times in\nthe vernaculars\u2014in increasingly sophisticated versions. Both the\neditions and the translations were intended to allow for a correct\nunderstanding of the text, which was often used by doctors and\napothecaries. The same thing happened with Dioscorides\u2019\nMateria medica, a text that unlike the encyclopedic\nNatural History was plainly addressed to a medical audience,\nand which was then repeatedly emended and translated by professional\nphysicians and natural philosophers. Yet, also authors like Virgil,\nHorace and Ovid were common presences in discussions about botany, and\neven a philological evaluation of the text of the Bible could\nprovide material to natural philosophers.\n\nThe foundation of botanical gardens in Pisa, Padua, and Florence\n(1544\u20131545), and then in Bologna, Leiden, Oxford, Montpellier,\nand Germany testify to the fact that empirical knowledge was\nincreasingly considered a necessity even in the universities, despite\nthe fact that even at the end of the sixteenth century chairs in\nbotany, such as the one occupied by Andrea Cesalpino (1519\u20131603)\nin Pisa, came with lower salaries than the ones given to their\n\u201cspeculative colleagues\u201d who taught natural philosophy or\nmedicine. The aforementioned catalogues of animals and plants, like\nthose published by Pierre Belon (1517\u20131564), Guillaume Rondelet\n(1507\u20131566), and Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522\u20131605), were thus\na combination of received authority and empirical observation, based\non 1) a philological and critical knowledge of the classical texts,\nnot a passive reading of them; and 2) direct observations and\nconversations not only with erudite peers and colleagues, but also\nwith the so-called \u201cinvisible\ntechnicians\u201d\u2014fishermen, sailors, and peasants who had\nfirst-hand knowledge of the relevant subjects and provided scientists\nwith important pieces of information. Not by chance, in a\nlittle-explored field like the study of minerals, the most significant\ncontributions came from self-described \u201cmen without\nletters\u201d (meaning not Latinate), such as Leonardo da Vinci\n(1452\u20131519) and the potter Bernard Palissy (1510\u20131589),\nwho identified fossils as the result of organic processes rather than\nabstract virtues.\n\nThese empirical approaches were also stimulated by the European\ndiscovery of the Americas and other continents, which contained plants\nand animals never known or never described by classical authorities\nlike Aristotle and Pliny. The new knowledge brought by travelers and\nexplorers helped debunk erroneous doctrines advocated by Aristotle,\nsuch as the uninhabitability of the torrid zone from\nMeteorology 362b 6\u20139: a major exponent of Renaissance\nAristotelianism, Pietro Pomponazzi (1462\u20131525), publicly mocked\nthe Philosopher during his classes when discussing this passage, and\nsupported his position by referring to the direct, recent observations\nof the navigator Antonio Pigafetta.\n\nThe shift from a text-based approach to the study of nature founded on\nthe study of a limited number of authors, to a new one based on an\nenlarged encyclopedia and, above all, direct observation, reached its\nfull expression at the time of Galileo Galilei; but it was already\nperceptible in the writings of Lorenzo Valla (circa\n1406\u20131457)\u2014who appealed to common sense against the\nabsurdity of some of the Aristotelian tenets\u2014and in those of\nLeonardo da Vinci, who invoked a virtuous interaction between science\nand practice. When Tommaso Campanella (1568\u20131639) stated that he\nlearned more from the anatomy of an ant or an herb than from any book\never written, he was simply expressing in a beautiful and poetic form\na shared methodological creed.\n",
