    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\n\nBorn on September 11, 1903 as Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund, Adorno lived\nin Frankfurt am Main for the first three decades of his life and the\nlast two (M\u00fcller-Doohm 2005, Claussen 2008). He was the only son\nof a wealthy German wine merchant of assimilated Jewish background and\nan accomplished musician of Corsican Catholic descent. Adorno studied\nphilosophy with the neo-Kantian Hans Cornelius and music composition\nwith Alban Berg. He completed his Habilitationsschrift on\nKierkegaard's aesthetics in 1931, under the supervision of the\nChristian socialist Paul Tillich. After just two years as a university\ninstructor (Privatdozent), he was expelled by the Nazis,\nalong with other professors of Jewish heritage or on the political\nleft. A few years later he turned his father's surname into a middle\ninitial and adopted \u201cAdorno,\u201d the maternal surname by which he is best\nknown.\n\n\nAdorno left Germany in the spring of 1934. During the Nazi era he\nresided in Oxford, New York City, and southern California. There he\nwrote several books for which he later became famous, including\nDialectic of Enlightenment (with Max Horkheimer),\nPhilosophy of New Music, The Authoritarian\nPersonality (a collaborative project), and Minima\nMoralia. From these years come his provocative critiques of mass\nculture and the culture industry. Returning to Frankfurt in 1949 to\ntake up a position in the philosophy department, Adorno quickly\nestablished himself as a leading German intellectual and a central\nfigure in the Institute of Social Research. Founded as a free-standing\ncenter for Marxist scholarship in 1923, the Institute had been led by\nMax Horkheimer since 1930. It provided the hub to what has come to be\nknown as the Frankfurt School. Adorno became the Institute's director\nin 1958. From the 1950s stem In Search of Wagner, Adorno's\nideology-critique of the Nazi's favorite composer; Prisms, a\ncollection of social and cultural studies; Against\nEpistemology, an antifoundationalist critique of Husserlian\nphenomenology; and the first volume of Notes to Literature, a\ncollection of essays in literary criticism. \n\n\nConflict and consolidation marked the last decade of Adorno's life.\nA leading figure in the \u201cpositivism dispute\u201d in German sociology,\nAdorno was a key player in debates about restructuring German\nuniversities and a lightning rod for both student activists and their\nright-wing critics. These controversies did not prevent him from\npublishing numerous volumes of music criticism, two more volumes of\nNotes to Literature, books on Hegel and on existential\nphilosophy, and collected essays in sociology and in aesthetics.\nNegative Dialectics, Adorno's magnum opus on epistemology and\nmetaphysics, appeared in 1966. Aesthetic Theory, the other\nmagnum opus on which he had worked throughout the 1960s, appeared\nposthumously in 1970. He died of a heart attack on August\n6, 1969, one month shy of his sixty-sixth birthday.\n",
