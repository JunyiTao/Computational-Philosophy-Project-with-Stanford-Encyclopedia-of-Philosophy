    "main_text": "Analytical Marxism || Further Disambiguation\n1.4 Further Disambiguation\n\nAnalytical Marxism, so understood, is not to be confused with adjacent\nintellectual movements that have shared the same, or a closely\nrelated, label, and with which they may have some affinity. Two\nearlier and non-Anglophone examples might be noted here.\n\nFirst, a Japanese school of Marxist economics, also known as\n\u201canalytical Marxism\u201d, developed in the 1930s and was\nassociated with the work of Shibata Kei and others based at Kyoto\nUniversity. Shibata pioneered the critical use of tools of modern\nneoclassical economics to the problems of Marxist economics; in\nparticular, contributing to a mathematical theorem which maintains\nthat viable innovations in production methods will only increase or\nmaintain the equilibrium rate of profit (Howard & King 1992;\nNegishi 2004; Rieu 2009).\n\nSecond, is a Polish school of \u201canalytical-linguistic\nMarxism\u201d, associated with the work of Adam Schaff and\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Krajewski in the 1960s. It is said to have\nresulted from a \u201ccollision\u201d between Marxism and the Polish\ntradition of analytic philosophy (Skolimowski 1967), and involved, in\nparticular, attempts to incorporate analytical tools into Marxist\ntreatments of semantics and epistemology (Wo\u017aniak 2022).\n\nThese, and other, adjacent movements are not discussed further in this\nentry.\n",
