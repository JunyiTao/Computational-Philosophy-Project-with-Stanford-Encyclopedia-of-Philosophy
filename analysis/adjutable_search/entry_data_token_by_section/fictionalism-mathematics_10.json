    "main_text": "Objections to Fictionalism and Responses || Accepting and Believing\n2.5 Accepting and Believing\n\nAs became clear in section 2.2, while fictionalists think that\nsentences like \u20182 + 2 = 4\u2019 are strictly speaking false,\nthey nonetheless think they\u2019re \u201ccorrect\u201d in some\nsense of the term. What, then, is the fictionalist\u2019s\nattitude toward these sentences? Following Bas van Fraassen\n(1980), who endorses a similar view with respect to empirical science,\nthe standard fictionalist line here is that they accept\nsentences like \u20182 + 2 = 4\u2019 without believing\nthem. How exactly acceptance should be defined is a matter of some\ncontroversy, but one obvious way to proceed here is to claim that\nfictionalists accept a pure mathematical sentence S if and\nonly if they believe that S is true in the story of mathematics. \n\nSome people object to the distinction between belief and acceptance.\nHorwich (1991), O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne (1997), and Burgess and Rosen\n(1997) present arguments for the claim that there is no real\ndifference between acceptance and belief because, roughly, (a) to\nbelieve something is just to be disposed to behave in certain ways,\nand (b) those who believe that 2 + 2 = 4 and those who allegedly only\naccept that 2 + 2 = 4 are presumably disposed to behave in exactly the\nsame ways. \n\nDaly (2008) and Leng (2010) provide a number of responses to this\nargument. One point Daly makes is that fictionalists are in fact\nnot disposed to behave in the same ways that platonists are.\nThey\u2019re disposed to behave very differently in response to\nquestions like, \u201cDo there actually exist any such things as\nnumbers?\u201d \n",
