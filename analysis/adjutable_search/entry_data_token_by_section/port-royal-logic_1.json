    "main_text": "The Cartesian Background\n2. The Cartesian Background\n\nAlthough Augustine shaped the theology of Jansenism, Ren\u00e9\nDescartes\u2019 influence predominates in the philosophical aspects\nof the Logic. Arnauld\u2019s insightful and respectful set\nof \u201cObjections\u201d to Descartes\u2019 Meditations\nalong with Descartes\u2019 \u201cReplies\u201d were first published\nin 1641 (see Descartes 1984 for English translation, abbreviated CSM).\nThis exchange confirmed Arnauld in his belief that Descartes\u2019\nsystem of philosophy was very well suited to furthering his own\nversion of the Port-Royal theological program. He was impressed by\nDescartes\u2019 frequent insistence that natural science,\nmetaphysical speculation, and even mathematics and logic were to be\nsubordinated to ethical and religious ends (Lachterman 1989, Jones\n2006). Especially important was Descartes\u2019 project of\ndemonstrating that the foundations of natural science are compatible\nwith, and in fact depend on God. The dualism of mental and corporeal\ncreated substances made it possible to conceive the natural world\nmechanically without recourse to any of the additional quasi-spiritual\nentities posited by Aristotelians. Geometrically construed matter\nrequires only God\u2019s creative activity to be the subject matter\nof Cartesian physics. The Logic\u2019s introductory\n\u201cFirst Discourse\u201d announces the intention to choose\nexamples throughout the book that promote both correct religious\nmorality and the best (i.e., Cartesian) science. Examples of how\nreason favors Cartesian science over its competitors are accordingly\nsprinkled throughout the Logic.\n\nThe resources of Cartesian philosophy for repudiating skepticism also\nappealed to Arnauld. Cartesian knowledge is grounded in clear and\ndistinct perceptions of reason alone. Truths delivered by reason alone\ncannot be doubted unless they are not clear and distinct and thus\n\u201cconfused\u201d in Descartes\u2019 terminology. For Descartes\nand Arnauld this means that skeptical denials of fundamental truths\nare merely verbal (Logic, First Discourse 7; also see Lennon\n2008: 62\u201377). The soul surrenders to the truth whenever it is\nstrongly penetrated by it just as eyes see whenever they are open and\nstruck by sunlight (Logic, First Discourse, 8). For example,\none who affirms that \u201cIt is doubtful that God exists\u201d must\nfail to clearly and distinctly perceive God. The Logic sets\nitself against Montaigne and Pyrrhonian skepticism in particular, but\nalso takes frequent opportunities to undercut skeptical threats from\nmaterialism and irreligion. Elsewhere, Arnauld wanted to emphasize\nalong with Descartes himself that the latter\u2019s \u201cmethod of\ndoubt\u201d as presented in the Meditations \u201cshould be\nstudied only by very intelligent and well-educated readers\u201d\n(Replies to fourth set of objections [CSM II, 172]). This restriction\nwas meant to avoid encouraging the very doubts that Descartes\nintroduces as part of the specialized method for attaining certain\nknowledge.\n\nEven more important for the Logic is Descartes\u2019\nattitude toward formal logic. In his early, incomplete Rules for\nthe Direction of the Native Intellect (c. 1628) and the\nwell-known Discourse on Method (1637), Descartes eschewed\ntraditional logic in favor of techniques for acquiring knowledge in\nthe first place. Syllogisms rarely accomplish that; they serve instead\nas a means of presenting what is already known. His view of deductive\ninference was accordingly based on his theory of the mind\u2019s\nperceptions. From our contemporary perspective, it could be said that\nDescartes\u2019 philosophical system replaced formal logic with\nepistemology and the philosophy of mind. The Logic does\ndevote considerable space to a treatment of formal techniques, but the\nreader is repeatedly reminded that this is of secondary importance.\nThe full title of the book is Logic, or the Art of Thinking,\nnot the art of reasoning or the art of inferring. The book also\ncontains a wealth of examples meant to illustrate moral and religious\nnorms and\n\n\n\u2026almost as much metaphysics as one ought to know, although we\ndo not claim not to have borrowed from anyone. (Logic, First\nDiscourse, 12)\n\n\nBecause the Logic\u2019s digressions into the non-logical\nterritories of natural science and religion are often lengthy, they\ninfluence the character of the book. The authors claim that these\nfeatures add to the book\u2019s readability and that they are\nconcrete applications of its general lessons to present knowledge\nabout actual things.\n",
