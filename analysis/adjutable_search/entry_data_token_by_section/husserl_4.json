    "main_text": "The phenomenological epoch\u00e9\n5. The phenomenological epoch\u00e9\n\nAn externalist reading (or rational reconstruction) of Husserl\u2019s\ntheory of content might, however, be taken to conflict with the\nmethodological constraints posed by the phenomenological\nepoch\u00e9, which\u2014together with the dynamic method\nand eidetic reduction\u2014builds the essential core of the\ntranscendental-phenomenological method introduced in\nIdeas.\n\nHusserl developed the method of epoch\u00e9 or\n\u201cbracketing\u201d around 1906. It may be regarded as a\nradicalization of the methodological constraint, already to be found\nin Logical Investigations, that any phenomenological\ndescription proper is to be performed from a first person\npoint of view, so as to ensure that the respective item is described\nexactly as is experienced, or intended, by the subject. Now\nfrom a first-person point of view, one cannot, of course, decide\nwhether in a case of what one takes to be, say, an act of perception\none is currently performing, there actually is an object that one is\nperceptually confronted with. For instance, it is well possible that\none is hallucinating. From a first-person point of view, there is no\ndifference to be made out between the veridical and the non-veridical\ncase\u2014for the simple reason that one cannot at the same time\nfall victim to and detect a perceptual error or\nmisrepresentation. In the non-veridical case, too, a transcendent\nobject appears to \u201cconstitute itself\u201d in consciousness. It\nis for such reasons that Husserl demanded (in Ideas) that in\na phenomenological description proper the existence of the object(s)\n(if any) satisfying the content of the intentional act described must\nbe \u201cbracketed\u201d. That is to say, the phenomenological\ndescription of a given act and, in particular, the phenomenological\nspecification of its intentional content, must not rely upon the\ncorrectness of any existence assumption concerning the\nobject(s) (if any) the respective act is about. Thus, the\nepoch\u00e9 has us focus on those aspects of our\nintentional acts and their contents that do not depend on the\nexistence of a represented object out there in the extra-mental\nworld.\n\nOn closer inspection, however, Husserl actually draws upon two\ndifferent versions of the epoch\u00e9 when introducing this\nmethod in Ideas, which versions he does not separate as\nclearly as one might have hoped: the \u201cuniversal\nepoch\u00e9\u201d on the one hand, and a weaker\n\u201clocal epoch\u00e9\u201d (as one could label it) on\nthe other. The former version (as described in Ideas) seems\nto require the phenomenologist to put all his existence\nassumptions regarding the external world into brackets at once, at any\npoint, whereas the weaker version merely requires him to bracket\nparticular existence assumptions. The weaker version\nunderlies the introducing of the notion of noema in Ideas\nin connection with examples like the perceptual hallucination (a\nconcept not applicable within the universal epoch\u00e9; see\nOvergaard 2004, p. 23) of a blooming apple tree (Husserliana,\nvol. III/1, pp. 204 ff): Husserl here in fact only brackets the\nexistence of particular real objects (Beyer 2000, pp. 140\u2013148).\nBy contrast, the sole function of the universal epoch\u00e9 in\nIdeas seems to be to establish the \u201cresiduum\u201d\nthesis, according to which the realm of \u201cpure\nconsciousness\u201d exists independently of the external world. His\nargument for this thesis in Ideas, referring to the\npossibility of \u201cworld annihilation\u201d, is flawed, however\n(see Beyer 2000, pp. 138 ff; 2007, pp. 76ff) and, as Erhard (2014, fn.\n718) has observed, Husserl later discovered the relevant fallacy\nhimself (cf. Husserliana, vol. XXXIX, 256f). \n\nThis leaves it an open question what other function the epoch\u00e9\nmay serve in the context of Husserl\u2019s methodology. The most plausible\ninterpretation seems to be that \u201cthe only thing that is excluded\nas a result of the epoch\u00e9 is a certain naivety, the naivety of\nsimply taking the world for granted, thereby ignoring the contribution\nof consciousness (Husserliana, vol. 27/173)\u201d\n(Zahavi 2017, p. 67; also cf. Landgrebe 1982a, pp. 26 ff), where\n\u201cthe suspension [of existential positings] in question is\nmerely propaedeutic and provisional\u201d (Zahavi 2017, p. 58).\n\nOnly the method of universal epoch\u00e9 as introduced in\nIdeas seems to conflict with our externalist reading: if no\nextra-mental existence assumptions whatsoever are admitted at any\npoint, then phenomenologically there cannot be object-dependent\nintentional contents, as externalism would have it. By contrast, there\nmay be some such contents, even many of them, without intentional\ncontent generally having to be dependent on a particular extra-mental\nobject. Which leaves enough room for the method of\nepoch\u00e9 to apply to any given particular case, as will\nbecome clear in Section 6.\n",
