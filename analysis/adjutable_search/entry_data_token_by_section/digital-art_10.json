Locative Art\n\nDigital media can also be used for the purpose of connecting physical\nlocations to virtual ones by using locative media. The phrase\n\u201clocative art\u201d is traced to Karlis Kalnins who applied the\nphrase to experimental projects coming from Locative Media Lab, a\ncollective of international researchers and practitioners working with\nlocative media. (Galloway & Ward 2005 ). Since the term\n\u201clocative\u201d is connected to location, site-specificity\nplays a significant role in our appreciation of locative works. Unlike\nwith non-digital cases, however, site-specificity in locative art is\nboth physical and virtual. The general concept is this:\nlocative-specific media connect physical spaces with virtual ones, the\nperceptual features of which are generated from a digital device by\nhuman interactions. We often experience locative media in our ordinary\nand daily lives through navigation systems like Google Maps or Waze,\nand also creatively through augmented reality apps like Pokemon Go, AR\ngraffiti (an app that allows users to visualize what their graffiti\nwill look like in situ), architectural simulators, and more.\nThese are location-based works, often called locative projects or\nlocative art, that use locative media. While locative technology has\nbeen around for decades, it is a relatively new subcategory to be\nrecognized within the arts. Even so, locative art is more broadly\nacknowledged in the fields of technology, games, and sociology.\n\nTo understand the many ways locative media might be used for artistic\npractice, consider the following three examples.\n\nWhat Was There (2010\u20132023) was a website that allows users\nto type in the coordinates of their current location (via their\ndigital device) to see how certain geographical locations look\nthroughout history. By typing a specific address into the application,\nthe user experiences the physical location in front of them and\nrepresented images and facts of that location as they appeared in the\npast, from the same vantage point. Data on the site relies on regular\ncitizens to upload historic images and connect them to specific\nlocations, making them accessible to others; the greater the\nparticipation the richer the experience when navigating a particular\nplace. Not only can guests gain a deeper connection to their specific\nlocalized places, but such applications motivate people to explore and\nappreciate locations outside of their normal destinations. \nThe Transborder Immigrant Tool has been used in a number of\nartworks and exhibitions.\n\n\n\nThe Transborder Immigrant Tool, devised by Electronic Disturbance\nTheater 2.0/b.a.n.g. lab, was a mobile phone application intended to\nguide individuals who were making their way to the United States\nthrough the deserts of the U.S./Mexico borderlands to water. The\napplication delivered poetry to its users in an effort to assist in\ntheir emotional and mental well-being while offering information about\nsurvival during the dangerous journey.\n\nThe creators of The Transborder Immigrant Tool considered it to be a\nperformance intervention that included the app itself, its API, public\nreactions, and an ensuing government investigation. By the time TBT\nwas ready for distribution in 2011, the border crossing had become\nmore dangerous, presenting the risk that carrying a TBT phone might\nput users in danger. While the project was never distributed to its\nintended users, it still succeeded in confounding systems of political\ncontrol, creating a call to action that resonated internationally, and\nusing poetry to \u201cdissolve\u201d the US-Mexico border\n(Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0 et al 2007).\n\n\nKlingKlangKlong is played with smartphones that translate the\nplayers\u2019 locations into sound. This is achieved in a\nstraightforward manner: By moving through the physical space, the\nplayers simultaneously move on the surface of a virtual sequencer. One\ndimension (usually the latitude of the player) corresponds to pitch,\nthe other dimension (longitude) is mapped to the time-position on the\nsequencer. The interface allows a manual switch to other audio\nparameters, although this feature is experimental. Each device\nreceives the location and state changes of the currently active\nplayers almost instantly. The devices are connected by a central\nserver, which also sets the boundaries of the playing field and\nmanages the virtual players.\n\n\n\nKlingKlangKlong serves as an experimental arrangement to explore the\nidea of playful (social) systems, a construction where human and\nvirtual subsystems play with each other. In addition to the human\nparticipants, it therefore deploys a number of virtual players\n(\u00bbVirtuals\u00ab). Humans and Virtuals meet each other in mixed\nreality, a concept that was realized in early locative games. The\ncommonly created soundtrack is the primary medium of communication\nbetween the players. Musical structures may temporarily arise through\nsynchronized movements or be destroyed by any player\u2019s\nintervention (Straeubig & Quack 2016).\n\n\n\nIn each of these examples, users synchronize geographical locations\nwith virtual ones, granting mobility for users while also further\nchallenging the paradigm of museum-driven works and art appreciation.\nThe interactivity described in section 4 factors significantly into\neach of these projects, but also of importance are the social,\neconomic, environmental, and political implications that factor in the\ndesign, development, and use of such works. Most of these projects are\nintended to bring about positive change, one way or another, by using\nlocative media and by borrowing certain gaming mechanics for the\npurpose of engagement and interactivity. In fact, much of what is\nwritten about locative art is from fields within digital media studies\non the media\u2019s \u2018playable\u2019 qualities (avoiding the\nidea that artists are trying to merely gamify public spaces).\n\nOn the playable nature of locative art, Miguel Sicart says,\n\n\n\nthe data produced and used in smart cities should not necessarily be\npresented as a utility for citizens. It should be presented as a prop\nfor play, as games but also as the source for toys and playgrounds.\nData-rich cities can become playable cities, and, by becoming such,\nthey can become more human, more inclusive spaces (Ackermann: 2016,\n27).\n\n\n\nOnce again, the process-oriented and performative nature of locative\nworks is central to appreciating the spaces they create. In connection\nwith the playability of locative media, locative projects are also\nmodifiable and typically intended to be hackable by the public in the\ncommunities where they are displayed. While the terms\n\u201chacker\u201d and \u201chacking\u201d may carry negative\nconnotations, in its original conception, the practice of hacking was\nmeant to improve upon existing computer programs, acknowledging the\nachievements of both the original creator and subsequent revisionists\n(Levy:1984). It is in this vein that locative projects are usually\nintended to change and improve over time given how users\n\u201cplay\u201d with the data and inputs. In other words, local\ncommunities can play with these projects and even modify them, making\nlocative works as relevant and reflective of the community as\npossible.\n\nThe above suggests that locative projects often have broader goals\nthan mere entertainment. Although often intended to motivate play and\nplayful attitudes, which, as indicated in the examples above can occur\nto varying degrees, the goal-oriented nature of locative works often\nmakes the kind of play involved a \u201cserious\u201d kind. Serious\nplay occurs when the enjoyment and pleasure that come from play do not\njust comprise entertainment but also serve some meritorious,\nreal-world goal. A work can be said to support serious play even when\nusers are not aware of the social or political goals of the work.\n\nThe customizable nature of locative media lends itself well to the\naltruistic aims of many locative artists. However, inclusivity,\nclimate protection, social change, and any other desired effect of\nlocative projects requires a given community to have sufficient funds\nfor, access to, and user-knowledge about digital locative technology.\nThis concern can also be understood, not just in terms of community\nrequirements, but also in terms of technological requirements, for\nsuccessful locative art. One way of putting it is as follows:\n\n\nFor any technological device to be \u201caware\u201d of its\ncontext\u2014physical or otherwise\u2014it has to be able to locate,\nclassify, collect, store, and use \u201crelevant\u201d information,\nas well as to identify and discard or ignore \u201cirrelevant\u201d\ninformation (Galloway & Ward 2005).\n\n\nThere are numerous political and economic factors affecting access to\nlocal and global spaces. With locative art, these factors are\nconcerning for both ethical and artistic reasons.\n",
