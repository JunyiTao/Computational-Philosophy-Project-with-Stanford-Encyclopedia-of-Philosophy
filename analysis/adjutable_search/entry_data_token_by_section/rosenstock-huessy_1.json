    "main_text": "Life and Work\n2. Life and Work\n\nEugen Rosenstock was born in 1888. His parents were assimilated (i.e.\nnon religious) German Jews. His mother and father, a banker,\nencouraged academic pursuits in their children. At school his classes\nwere in Latin, and from a young age he devoted himself to history and\nlinguistics. His passion for learning languages extended to teaching\nhimself Egyptian hieroglyphics while a teenager. He is probably one of\nthe very few social philosophers who (apart from his fluency in\nseveral modern European languages) not only read the biblical writers,\nancient philosophers, poets, orators and Church fathers in their\noriginal languages, but was equally at home deciphering the walls of\nan Egyptian temple. This schooling formed the basis of an approach to\nreality which always considered the different underlying\nimperatives\u2014divine and human\u2014that fused a group or led to\nits dissolution. It also provided him with what he insisted was a\nguiding methodological principle in his life: to make no historical\nargument that was not based upon his own consultation of the original\nsource material.\n\nHe joined the Protestant church at 17. By his own account, this was\nnot due to any great existential anxiety, but to having reached the\nconclusion at a very young age that what was stated in the Nicene\nCreed was manifestly obvious (1970b, 197). Rosenstock-Huessy insisted\nthat Christianity was not a religion of transcendence and was not to\nbe confused with Platonism of any sort, but was about building the\nages or times to come in this world. It was first and foremost a\ndiscovery about the process of incarnation and the way to overcome\nsocial death. Nor for him was the Church, as it was, for example, for\nKarl Barth or Emil Brunner, for the great part a massive deviation\nfrom the gospel. Rather, not only in spite of but, to a significant\nextent, because of its flaws, it was the story of the incarnation of\nthe spirit and the recreation of human nature into a different body,\nthe body of Christ. In other words, the task of the Church was that of\nmaking man like God, what the Church fathers in the Athanasian creed\nhad called \u2018anthropurgy\u2019 (1946, 108). Such core Christian\nterms as \u2018last judgment\u2019 or \u2018redemption\u2019,\nthen, had nothing to do with the individual surviving after death in a\nplace called heaven or hell (an idea he thought owed more to Plato\nthan Jesus or Paul). Resurrection meant the resuscitation of\nhistorically spent forms of life so that their powers could be tapped\nfor generations to come; the last judgment refers to the decision\neither to \u2018resurrect\u2019 a dead form of life, or let it die.\nThus in his \u2018Faculty Address on The Potential Christians of the\nFuture\u2019:\n\nAnd I know of the Last Judgment as a reality because I have seen Last\nJudgments passed on Proust\u2019s France, on Rasputin\u2019s Russia, on Wilhelm\nII\u2019s Germany, President Harding\u2019s America. Similarly I believe in\nresurrection of the body because I see resurrections of bodies, all\nthrough history, on earth. Any genuine soul will be incarnated time\nand again (1941, 11\u201312).\n\n\nExamples of incarnations he mentions, beside Christ himself in the\nChurch, are St. Francis in the Franciscan order and all its\nachievements, Leonardo da Vinci by succeeding generations of\nengineers, Sigmund Freud in the psychiatric movement, Marx in the\nworkers\u2019 movement, and so on (1956, 303\u2013309).\n\nRosenstock-Huessy studied jurisprudence and received his doctorate\n(for Herzogsgewalt und Friedensschutz) from the University of\nHeidelberg at the age of 21, from which time he went on to teach at\nthe university. He was also to receive a second doctorate in 1923 in\nHistory from the same university, for his K\u00f6nigshaus und\nSt\u00e4mme in Deutschland zwischen 911 und 1250, a book he had\npublished in 1914. His teachers included Rudolf Sohm and Otto Gierke,\nboth key figures in the historical school of law. While he was not a\ndisciple of either, throughout his life he would never cease writing\non the growth and decay of socio-political formations and what forced\npeople to hate one form of life and seek to found another.\n\nAmongst his students was Franz Rosenzweig. In 1913 Rosenstock-Huessy\nplayed a pivotal role in convincing Rosenzweig that the \u2018living\nGod\u2019 was not the God of metaphysics who, thankfully, had been\npronounced dead by Nietzsche, but referred to a power more\n\u2018meaningful\u2019 and \u2018truthful\u2019 than could be\naccounted for by the limited powers of philosophy. By this he was not\nreferring to any mystical powers, but the full gamut of creative and\nredemptive powers that are created and revealed throughout the human\nstory. In this respect he played an important role in convincing\nRosenzweig that truth was not so much a property of things or states\nof affairs captured by the reflecting mind, but a state of fecundity\nproduced by the act appropriate for the time in which it was\nperformed. If Rosenstock-Huessy can be said to have an epistemology\nwhich can be reproduced in one sentence, it is Goethe\u2019s \u2018What is\nfruitful, that alone is true\u2019, which is but a recasting of the\nbiblical \u2018by their fruits you shall know them\u2019 (1968,\n11).\n\nIn 1914, he met and married Margrit Huessy whom he loved dearly. They\nhad a son, Hans, and they remained married until her death in 1958. He\nwas then joined by Freya von Moltke, who was to be his companion until\nhis death in 1973. Freya von Moltke was the widow of his former\nstudent, Helmuth von Moltke, a key member of the Kreisau circle who\nwas executed by Hitler near the conclusion of World War 2.\n\nDuring the Great War, Rosenstock-Huessy served as a captain in the\nGerman army where he fought on the Western front. In 1916 he began an\nintense correspondence with Rosenzweig (now published in English as\nJudaism Despite Christianity) who by that time had decided\nnot to follow Rosenstock-Huessy and his cousins, the Ehrenbergs, into\nChristianity, but to fully embrace the Jewish faith into which he had\nbeen born. That correspondence has remained a major post-Nietzschean\nChristian/Jewish dialogue. While in that correspondence\nRosenstock-Huessy was uncompromising in his insistence that Judaism\nwas a spent historical force, he continued to reflect upon\nRosenzweig\u2019s decision to remain a Jew throughout his life. He came to\nthe opinion that Rosenzweig had convincingly demonstrated the eternal\nrole of Judaism in the human story.\n\nA year after this exchange began Rosenzweig met and fell in love with\nRosenstock-Huessy\u2019s wife, Margrit or Gritli. Rosenstock-Huessy\naccepted, though not without suffering (Stahmer, 2006), the love that\nhad developed between his best friend and his wife, and years later he\nwould confide to his friend and devotee Georg M\u00fcller that Margrit\nhad been Rosenzweig\u2019s muse throughout the writing of The Star of\nRedemption, and, more precisely, that Rosenzweig\u2019s understanding\nof revelation, which plays such a decisive role in that same work,\ncame directly out of his experience of his love for Gritli. This has\nbeen borne out in the relatively recent publication of Rosenzweig\u2019s\nletters to Gritli (Briefe an Gritli) which has been the\nbiggest event in Rosenzweig scholarship since Edith Rosenzweig\u2019s\nedition of his Briefe in\n 1935.[8]\n\n\nRosenstock-Huessy had entered the Great War as a Christian\nNationalist. By the War\u2019s end he was convinced that Germany\u2019s\nsalvation required the dropping of all nationalist\nallegiances\u2014its failure to do so, he predicted, would only throw\nit back again into further war. He also emerged from the War with an\nidea (first outlined in book-form in Die Hochzeit des Kriegs und\nder Revolution) that he would develop in Out of\nRevolution and Die Europ\u00e4ischen Revolutionen und der\nCharakter der Nationen\u2014that the Great War was the\nculmination of a millennium of revolutions and that it was these very\ncatastrophes which provided the genesis of new and more powerful\ninstitutional bulwarks for what would become the fulfillment of the\nkingdom promised to the Jews and later to the human race through\nChristianity.\n\nA core element of Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s social philosophy, which emerged\ndirectly from his experience of the War and his subsequent\n\u2018vision\u2019 of the meaning of a thousand years of European\nwars and revolutions and political legacies, was that suffering was a\nfundamental component of human learning. For the most part, and\nparticularly socially, truth was something imprinted on us by pain and\ntrauma rather than something merely learnt by candlelight. As he said\nbluntly in one public lecture: \u2018suffering is the only source of\nwisdom, and not my brain here \u2019 (1967, Microfilm 656, Reel 18).\nHe develops this idea in \u2018The Secret of the University\u2019 in\na manner which suggests we should be much more attentive to the\ncatastrophic conditions under which any new philosophy emerges if we\nwish to see it in its proper light\u2014 philosophy being but one\nresponse to a social catastrophe which requires a great redirection of\nenergies for either society\u2019s survival or its complete overthrow and\nthe establishment of a new type.\n\nNo philosopher ever sat down as if in a classroom to answer the\nquestions of his predecessor. To consider the history of philosophy in\nthis way is insanity. Descartes grew out of the Thirty Years War. He\nhas remained its eternal Privat-dozent. Kant became a philosopher\nafter the Seven Years War, Schopenhauer came to meditation on the\nbattlefields of Napoleon. The Franco-Prussian War forced Friedrich\nNietzsche out of mere philology (1950, Item 427, Reel 8).\n\n\nAfter the War Rosenstock-Huessy worked in Daimler Benz as an editor of\na worker\u2019s magazine before he returned to the academic life. The\ndesire to bridge the divide between education and the world remained a\nconstant thread of Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s life, including his being a\nfounding member of institutions such as the Academy of Labor in\nFrankfurt (1921) and the German Academy for Volk Research and Adult\nEducation (1926) and being vice chairman of the World Association of\nAdult Education (1928\u20131932). He was also a pioneer of the German\nwork service movement in Germany, which was designed to engage\nstudents with the rest of the community (a movement which was later to\nbe politicized and corrupted by the Nazis), and, after emigrating to\nthe United States, the establishment of Camp William James in Vermont\n(which was undertaken as part of Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s Civilian\nConservation Corps). The importance of the fusion of education with\nwork, for Rosenstock-Huessy, was based on his fundamental belief that\nhumanity would only free itself from the perils of its past through\ncreative collective acts, including reinvigorating the institutions\nwhich had themselves emerged as responses to, and ways out of,\ncatastrophes, as well as the establishment of new institutions\nappropriate for the times.\n\nWith Hitler\u2019s coming to power in 1933, Rosenstock-Huessy, his wife and\nson left Germany. The \u00e9migr\u00e9 political scientist Carl\nFriedrich helped him get work at Harvard, but it was not a satisfying\nexperience for him or many of his colleagues. He was forced to leave\nHarvard because he insisted that \u2018God\u2019 was a living\npresence in history. Within \u2018speech thinking\u2019, a core\naxiom is that a name which generates reality (as \u2018God\u2019\ndoes through invocation, supplication, devotion and the like) is real\n(more real, he insisted, than abstractions such as mind or body). At\nHarvard there was the collision of two paradigms and their respective\nvocabularies: Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s \u2018speech or\ndialogical-thinking\u2019 with its anti-naturalism (ironically, in\nthat environment, a voice of one) versus the naturalistically based\nbehaviorism that then predominated. A good example of the differing\nperspectives can be seen in Crane Brinton\u2019s scathing comments on\nOut of Revolution (1938) and Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s withering\nretort in his review of Brinton\u2019s The Anatomy of Revolution\n(1939).\n\nRosenstock-Huessy then started teaching social philosophy at Dartmouth\nwhere he remained for the rest of his academic career. While the stars\nof former friends and associates, such as Buber and Tillich, waxed in\nthe United States, he was largely unknown and unlistened to, except\nfor some devoted undergraduates who taped his undergraduate lectures\nfor posterity. He had not been completely forgotten in Germany, where\nhis post-war lectures were well attended and his books reviewed in\nnewspapers. While his name still crops up from time to time in\nEuropean historical or sociological works (his Die Europaischen\nRevolutionen is something of a German minor classic in European\nStudies), Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s ideas have not received a large\naudience. In part, at least, this has to do with his failure to\nconform to conventional academic categories of classification and\nscholarly protocols and disciplinary requirements, in particular the\ntheological/secular divide. In addition, there was almost no\nprevailing mood into which Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s thought seemed to tap:\nneither the aesthetic/literary mood of modernism (in general\nRosenstock-Huessy thought art was play\u2014and the period which\nspanned two world wars was not a time in which play would help stave\noff the next catastrophe); nor the subsequent radical student mood\nwhich Marxian-based social theories attended to (Rosenstock-Huessy\nthought neo-Marxists of all kinds to be a hundred years out of date);\nnor the psychoanalytic movement that derived from Freud or Jung (he\ndeeply mistrusted psychiatry, believing it placed too much weight upon\nthe ego and did not adequately grasp the collective socio-historical\nformations which shape it); nor phenomenology (whose dependence upon\nlived experience was closer in spirit to his own thought, but,\nnevertheless, its purview remained insufficiently dialogical and\ninsufficiently institutional for him to see much value in it). He was\nalso unforgiving of Heidegger (as he was of Carl Schmitt whom, before\nHitler\u2019s rise to power, he had once been on cordial terms with) and in\nthe Soziologie, he recounts, with contempt, a story in which\nElfride Heidegger talks of her husband and her having to weigh up\nwhether they would back the Marxists or the Nazis (2009, 2, 57). The\nproliferation of work in linguistics, which might have seemed to have\nprovided him with natural allies, did not help his case because he was\ndeeply opposed to what he thought was the prevailing atomistic and\nunduly scientistic approach to the study of language. Mauthner and\nSaussure, for example, he thought were so wrong they barely warranted\nengaging with. And someone like C.S. Peirce, whose pragmaticism has\ncertain affinities with Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s understanding of truth,\nalso differs from Rosenstock-Huessy in his preoccupation with\n\u2018reasonable\u2019 and \u2018objective statements\u2019 as the\nroad to truth. He saw himself more in the organicist tradition of\nHumboldt and was glad to find in R.A. Wilson\u2019s The Miraculous\nBirth of Language a contemporary linguist who had reached some\nsimilar conclusions to his concerning language\u2019s role and character in\nour social evolution.\n\nThis lack of academic \u2018fit\u2019 was a fact not lost on him and\nin the final paragraph of his Out of Revolution he wrote,\nwith an eye as much to his Harvard experience as to his awareness of\nhow he was being read:\n\nI have survived decades of study and teaching in scholastic and\nacademic sciences. Every one of their venerable scholars mistook me\nfor their intellectual type which he most despised. The atheist wanted\nme to disappear into Divinity, the theologians into sociology, the\nsociologists into history, the historians into journalism, the\njournalists into metaphysics, the philosophers into law,\nand\u2014need I say it?\u2014the lawyers into hell, which as a\nmember of our present world I have never left. For nobody leaves hell\nall by himself without going mad (1938, 758).\n\n\nBy the time Rosenstock-Huessy died in 1973 he had left behind a huge\ncollection of written work including his two volume\nSoziologie (the second volume of which is an attempt at\nuniversal history), the works on revolution, a collection of essays\nand small books gathered in a two volume work on language, Die\nSprache des Menschengeschlechts, and a three volume work on\nchurch history (with Joseph Wittig), Das Alter der\n Kirche,[9]\n to various writings on grammar, biblical interpretation, Egyptology,\nMedieval history, industrial law and the organization of the work\nplace.\n\nA few years before he died, a former student, Clinton Gardner, had\nformed Argo Press, to keep his work alive. A Gesellschaft had\nbeen started in Germany which produced a journal/newsletter,\nStimmstein, devoted to his work, influence, and related\nissues. In 1972 four families in Holland set up\n\u2018Rosenstock-Huessy House\u2019 in Haarlem to put\nRosenstock-Huessy\u2019s ideas concerning adult education and voluntary\nservice into practice through providing accommodation for people in\ncrisis. A DVD edition of his collected works has been created, thanks\nto the labours of Lise van der Molen and the efforts and donations of\nthe Rosenstock-Huessy Fund. W.H. Auden first heard of\nRosenstock-Huessy in 1940 from a friend and wrote a preface to a\ncollection of his writings (published by Argo in 1970 under the\nsalient title I am an Impure Thinker). After\nRosenstock-Huessy\u2019s death, Auden wrote a valedictory poem,\n\u2018Aubade\u2019, which was published in The Atlantic\nMonthly.\n",
