    "main_text": "Expression, Language, and Art\n4. Expression, Language, and Art\n\nThe concepts of expression and style are central to\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s thought and already play a key role in his first\ntwo books, where they characterize the perceptual exchange between an\norganism and its milieu, the body\u2019s sensible dialogue with the\nworld, and even the act of philosophical reflection (see Landes 2013).\nIn both works, Merleau-Ponty draws on a range of literary and artistic\nexamples to describe the creative and expressive dimensions of\nperception and reflection, emphasizing in particular the parallels\nbetween the task of the artist and that of the thinker: as the\nconcluding lines of the Preface to Phenomenology of\nPerception note,\n\n\nPhenomenology is as painstaking as the works of Balzac, Proust,\nVal\u00e9ry, or C\u00e9zanne\u2014through the same kind of\nattention and wonder, the same demand for awareness, the same will to\ngrasp the sense of the world or of history in its nascent state. (PP:\n22/lxxxv)\n\n\nExpression, particularly in language and the arts, plays an\nincreasingly central role in Merleau-Ponty\u2019s thought in the\nyears following Phenomenology, when he aimed to formulate a\ngeneral theory of expression as the grounding for a philosophy of\nhistory and culture. This interest is first reflected in a series of\nessays addressing painting, literature, and film published in the\nyears immediately following Phenomenology (in Merleau-Ponty\n1996b/1964). These include Merleau-Ponty\u2019s first essay on\npainting, \u201cC\u00e9zanne\u2019s Doubt\u201d, which finds in\nC\u00e9zanne a proto-phenomenological effort to capture the birth of\nperception through painting. C\u00e9zanne epitomizes the paradoxical\nstruggle of creative expression, which necessarily relies on the\nidiosyncracies of the artist\u2019s individual history and\npsychology, as well as the resources of the tradition of painting, but\ncan succeed only by risking a creative appropriation of these\nacquisitions in the service of teaching its audience to see the world\nanew. Similarly, Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s artistic productivity is\nexplicable neither in terms of his intellectual freedom\n(Val\u00e9ry) nor his childhood (Freud) but as the dialectic of\nspontaneity and sedimentation by which Merleau-Ponty had formerly\ndefined history.\n\nIn 1951, Merleau-Ponty summarizes his research after\nPhenomenology as focused on a \u201ctheory of truth\u201d\nexploring how knowledge and communication with others are\n\u201coriginal formations with respect to perceptual life, but\n\u2026 also preserve and continue our perceptual life even while\ntransforming it\u201d (UMP: 41\u201342/287). Expression, language,\nand symbolism are the key to this theory of truth and provide the\nfoundation for a philosophy of history and of\n\u201ctranscendental\u201d humanity. Whereas the study of perception\ncould only provide a \u201cbad ambiguity\u201d that mixes\n\u201cfinitude and universality\u201d, Merleau-Ponty sees in the\nphenomenon of expression a \u201cgood ambiguity\u201d that\n\u201cgathers together the plurality of monads, the past and the\npresent, nature and culture, into a single whole\u201d (UMP: 48/290).\nMany of Merleau-Ponty\u2019s courses from 1947 through 1953 at the\nUniversity of Lyon, the Sorbonne, and the Coll\u00e8ge de France\nfocus on language, expression, and\n literature.[6]\n\nThe manuscript partially completed during these years and published\nposthumously as The Prose of the World (1969/1973) pursues\nthese themes through a phenomenological investigation of literary\nlanguage and its relationship with scientific language and painting.\nCritiquing our commonsense ideal of a pure language that would\ntransparently encode pre-existing thoughts, Merleau-Ponty argues that\ninstituted language\u2014the conventional system of language as an\nestablished set of meanings and rules\u2014is derivative from a more\nprimordial function of language as genuinely creative, expressive, and\ncommunicative. Here he draws two insights from Saussurian linguistics:\nFirst, signs function diacritically, through their lateral relations\nand differentiations, rather than through a one-to-one correspondence\nwith a conventionally established meaning. Ultimately, signification\nhappens through the differences between terms in a referential system\nthat lacks any fixed or positive terms. This insight into diacritical\ndifference will later prove important to Merleau-Ponty\u2019s\nunderstanding of perception and ontology as well (see Alloa 2013a).\nSecond, the ultimate context for the operation of language is\neffective communication with others, by which new thoughts can be\nexpressed and meanings shared. Expression accomplishes itself through\na coherent reorganization of the relationships between acquired signs\nthat must teach itself to the reader or listener, and which may\nafterwards again sediment into a taken-for-granted institutional\nstructure.\n\nIn a long extract from the manuscript that was revised and published\nin 1952 as \u201cIndirect Language and the Voices of Silence\u201d\n(in Merleau-Ponty 1960/1964), Merleau-Ponty brings this understanding\nof language into conversation with Sartre\u2019s What is\nLiterature? and Andr\u00e9 Malraux\u2019s The Voices of\nSilence. Sharing Malraux\u2019s criticisms of the museum\u2019s\nrole in framing the reception of painting, but rejecting his\ninterpretation of modern painting as subjectivist, Merleau-Ponty\noffers an alternative understanding of \u201cinstitution\u201d (from\nHusserl\u2019s Stiftung) as the creative establishment of a\nnew field of meaning that opens an historical development. The style\nof an artist is not merely subjective but lived as a historical\ntrajectory of expression that begins with perception itself and\neffects a \u201ccoherent deformation\u201d in inherited traditions.\nRather than opposed as silent and speaking, painting and language are\nboth continuations of the expressivity of a perceptual style into more\nmalleable mediums. The unfinished character of modern painting is\ntherefore not a turn from the objectivity of representation toward\nsubjective creation but rather a more authentic testament to the\nparadoxical logic of all expression.\n\nMerleau-Ponty returns to the analysis of painting in his final essay,\n\u201cEye and Mind\u201d (1964a OEE), where he accords it an\nontological priority\u2014between the linguistic arts and\nmusic\u2014for revealing the \u201cthere is\u201d of the world that\nthe operationalism of contemporary science has occluded. It is by\n\u201clending his body to the world that the artist changes the world\ninto paintings\u201d (OEE: 16/353), and this presupposes that the\nartist\u2019s body is immersed in and made of the same stuff as the\nworld: to touch, one must be tangible, and to see, visible.\nMerleau-Ponty describes this as an \u201cintertwining\u201d or\n\u201coverlapping\u201d, in which the artist\u2019s situated\nembodiment is the other side of its opening to the world. There is as\nyet no sharp division between the sensing and the sensed, between body\nand things as one common \u201cflesh\u201d, and painting arises as\nthe expression of this relation: it is a \u201cvisible to the second\npower, a carnal essence or icon\u201d of embodied vision (OEE:\n22/355). Descartes\u2019s efforts, in the Optics, to\nreconstruct vision from thought leads him to focus on the\n\u201cenvelope\u201d or form of the object, as presented in engraved\nlines, and to treat depth as a third dimension modeled after height\nand width. This idealization of space has its necessity, yet, once\nelevated to a metaphysical status by contemporary science, it\nculminates in an understanding of being as purely positive and\nabsolutely determinate. The ontological significance of modern\npainting and the plastic arts\u2014e.g., Klee, de Sta\u00ebl,\nC\u00e9zanne, Matisse, Rodin\u2014lies in the alternative\nphilosophy that they embody, as revealed through their treatment of\ndepth, color, line, and movement. Ultimately, such works teach us anew\nwhat it means to see:\n\n\nVision is not a certain mode of thought or presence to self; it is the\nmeans given me for being absent from myself, for being present from\nthe inside at the fission of Being only at the end of which do I close\nup into myself.
