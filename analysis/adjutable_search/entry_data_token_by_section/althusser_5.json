    "main_text": "Early Work (1946\u201360) || Historical Work: Montesquieu and Feuerbach\n2.4 Historical Work: Montesquieu and Feuerbach\n\nTwo essays that Althusser wrote in the mid 1950s were the first to\nfocus exclusively on Marxist philosophy and are interesting inasmuch\nas they evidence his rejection of Hegel and his embrace of the\nParty\u2019s Marxism-Leninism. In addition, these texts suggest the\nneed for a thorough study of Marx. This study, however, would wait\nuntil the beginning of the next decade. For the rest of the 1950s,\nmost of Althusser\u2019s published work involved the study of\nphilosophical figures who preceded Marx. These figures included\nMontesquieu, on whose political philosophy and theory of history he\nwrote a book-length study, and Feuerbach, whose writings he translated\nand commented upon. The dual thesis of Althusser\u2019s Montesquieu\nbook: that, insofar as Montesquieu studies the \u201cconcrete\nbehavior of men\u201d he resists idealism and inaugurates the study\nof history as a science and that, insofar as Montesquieu accepts past\nand present political formations as delimiting the possibilities for\npolitical life, he remains an idealist, is one that will find echoes\nin Althusser\u2019s study of Marx during the next decade. Similarly,\ninasmuch as he makes the argument in a commentary (1960) that part of\nhis intention in translating Feuerbach is to show just what Marx owes\nin his early writings to the author of The Essence of\nChristianity so that these may be better seen as absent from\nMarx\u2019s mature work, these studies of Feuerbach can also be seen\nas propaedeutic to the study of Marx which Althusser inaugurated in\n1961 with his article \u201cOn the Young Marx\u201d.\n",
