    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u2018proposition\u2019 has a broad use in contemporary\nphilosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the\nprimary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other\n\u201cpropositional attitudes\u201d (i.e., what is believed,\ndoubted,\n etc.[1]),\n the referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of\nsentences.\n\nOne might wonder whether a single class of entities can play all these\nroles. If David Lewis (1986, p. 54) is right in saying that \u201cthe\nconception we associate with the word \u2018proposition\u2019 may be\nsomething of a jumble of conflicting desiderata,\u201d then\nit will be impossible to capture our conception in a consistent\ndefinition.\n\nThe best way to proceed, when dealing with quasi-technical words like\n\u2018proposition\u2019, may be to stipulate a definition and\nproceed with caution, making sure not to close off any substantive\nissues by definitional fiat.\n\nPropositions, we shall say, are the sharable objects of the attitudes\nand the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This stipulation rules\nout certain candidates for propositions, including thought- and\nutterance-tokens, which presumably are not sharable, and concrete\nevents or facts, which presumably cannot be false. These consequences\nfit well with contemporary usage. Our definition leaves open many of\nthe questions dividing propositionalists: which additional roles are\npropositions fit to play? would propositions have to be\nmind-independent or abstract? what individuation conditions would they\nhave? how would they relate to facts? We examine these issues below,\nas well as the fundamental issue of whether there are propositions at\nall.\n",
