On a straightforward version of this\nview, a typical stream of consciousness consists of a close-packed\ncontinuum of momentary (or very brief) phases. Although the contents\nof these phases are themselves momentary\u2014they do not present\nmotion or change, they are akin to static snapshots. But their\noccurrence in rapid succession succeeds in generating all the change,\nsuccession and motion we find in our experience. Or so the cinematic\ntheorist maintains: on their view nothing more is required. The basic\nfeatures of the model are depicted in\n Figure 3.1.\n On the left we see a punctual beam of awareness, the smooth, steady\nadvance of which generates a sequence of momentary snapshot-like\ncontents (of a falling object, in this instance), only a small\nselection of which is shown on the right.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1 The Cinematic Model. [An\n extended description of Figure 3.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAs we saw earlier, this approach can be traced back as far as St.\nAugustine and was later advocated by Reid, and more recently by\nBachelard. Phillipe Chuard (2011, 2017, 2020) is a contemporary\ndefender of the view, calling it the \u201csnapshot\ntheory\u201d:\n\n\n\u2026 the snapshot theorist argues, the phenomenology we seem to\nintrospect while enjoying successive experiential states not only\nsupervenes upon, but reduces to, those features of\nsuccessions just listed: the experiential properties of snapshots,\ntheir temporal arrangement, the gradual transitions in their\nsuccessive contents, our memories of previous experiences, and\ninability to detect small gaps and jumps, all contribute to what\nit\u2019s like to enjoy the sort of phenomenology associated with\nputative temporal experiences. (Chuard 2017: 125)\n\n\nIn\n \u00a71.2\n a distinction was drawn between realists and anti-realists, with\nrealists holding that change and succession can be directly perceived\nand anti-realists maintaining that it cannot. Chuard denies that\nchange can be directly apprehended, putting him in the antirealist\ncamp. But he also accepts that we seem to directly experience\nchange\u2014so realism appears to be true, even if it\nisn\u2019t.\n\nTo be clear, the snapshot view isn\u2019t trying to explain how we\ndo, in fact, have temporal experience. We don\u2019t, the snapshot\ntheorist surmises. Rather, the view aims to explain what it is like to\ngo through successions of very short conscious experiential states, to\nthen point out how the phenomenology thus accounted for seems\nindiscriminable from the phenomenology associated with the temporal\nexperience we allegedly enjoy. Thus, the snapshot view doesn\u2019t\nreject the phenomenological appearances, quite the contrary. It aims\nto explain them without liberally assuming that such experiences must\nbe taken entirely at face value, as revealing the metaphysical\nstructure of our streams of consciousness. (Chuard 2017:\n 126)[13]\n\nCritics of the cinematic theory are generally of the view that James\nwas correct when he drew a sharp distinction between a mere succession\nof experiences and an experience of succession, and since the\ncinematic theorist is providing us with no more than the former it\ncannot deliver an adequate account of the latter. Dainton (2000:\n\u00a75.5; 2008b: 57) invites us to imagine a group of five people\nstanding in line with their eyes closed, but directed at a nearby\ntennis game. If each of these people opens their eyes momentarily\nbefore closing them again we have a succession of five experiences,\neach revealing the on-court action at a particular moment. It seems\nclear that in this case there is nothing resembling an experience of\nsuccession: all each person sees is a momentary still image, and these\nmomentary states are completely isolated from one another\nexperientially. There is, Dainton suggests, a huge difference between\nthis sequence of experiences and our own streams of consciousness, but\nsince the cinematic theory fragments consciousness in an analogous way\nit is deeply implausible\n phenomenologically.[14]\n\nAs for how sequences of momentary static snapshots can give rise to\nexperiences with seemingly dynamic contents Reid and Chuard\nboth hold that memory plays an important role. In Reid\u2019s\nwords:\n\n\nIt is by memory that we have an immediate knowledge of things past:\nThe senses give us information of things only as they exist in the\npresent moment; and this information, if it were not preserved by\nmemory, would vanish instantly, and leave us as ignorant as if it had\nnever been. (EIP: III.1, p. 303)\n\n\nBut is memory enough? Phenomenologically there is an obvious\ndifference between perceptual experience and experiential memories:\nthe latter are far less detailed and far less vibrant than the former.\nGiven this, it is not obvious that combinations of instantaneous\nperceptual experiences and memories could provide us with the sorts of\nexperiences of change we actually enjoy: successions of experiences,\nyes; experiences of succession, no. For further discussion of appeals\nto memory see Dainton (2000: \u00a75.4) and Phillips (2010:\n\u00a75).\n\nWhat of the cinematic analogy itself? It is well known that rapid\nsuccessions of static images can result in experiences of\nmotion. The images shown on a TV or cinema screen are static\nsnapshots, but evidently, they are perceived as dynamic: objects on a\ncinema screen are seen to move as smoothly and continuously as their\nreal-life counterparts. This phenomenon\u2014known as \u201cillusory\nmotion\u201d or \u201cthe phi phenomenon\u201d was first explored\nin the nineteenth century by Exner, and has been much-studied since\nthen (not surprisingly, since it underpins televisual industries). But\nwhile it is real enough, the phi phenomenon is of little assistance to\nthe cinematic theorist. What the latter needs is an account of how\nsuccessions of momentary conscious states, each possessing\nentirely static contents, can give rise to the experience of motion.\nStatic images are indeed being displayed on a cinema screen while we\nview a movie, but not only are these onscreen stills not themselves\nexperiences, they do not register in our visual experience as\nstatic images: what we actually seem to see onscreen are objects\nin motion.\n\nIn the scientific literature the hypothesis that perceptual experience\ncomes packaged in discrete sub-second \u201cframes\u201d possessing\nstatic contents has been defended on a number of occasions. White\n(2018) undertakes a detailed survey of the relevant work in psychology\nand neuroscience. White\u2019s verdict is that the discrete frames\nhypothesis has not yet been decisively refuted, but it is seriously\nproblematic on a number of fronts.\n\nThe available evidence does not provide consistent support for any\nspecific duration for frames, and perceptual processes display a\nflexibility that is not readily reconcilable with the frame\nhypothesis. There are also\n\n\nproblems concerning the definition of frames, the need for\ninformational connections between frames, the means by which\nboundaries between frames are established.
