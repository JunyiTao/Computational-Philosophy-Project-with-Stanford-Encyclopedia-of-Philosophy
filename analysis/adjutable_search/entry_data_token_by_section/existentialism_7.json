    "main_text": "Freedom\n4. Freedom\nRecognizing that there is no pre-given essence that determines\nexistence, the existentialist makes it clear that it is up to the\nindividual to make his, her, or their own identity through choices and\nactions. Sartre explains that the coward, for instance, is not the way\nhe is because of an unstable childhood or a particular genetic makeup.\nThe coward \u201cmakes himself a coward\u201d by means of his\ndecisions (1946 [2001, 301]). In this way, the existentialist generally\naffirms the view that the human being has free will, is able to make\ndecisions, and can be held responsible for their\n actions.[4]\nBut, as we will see,\nthis does not mean that we can do whatever we want. It means, rather,\nthat existence is structured by our capacity to give meaning to our\nsituation based on the actions and choices we make as our lives unfold.\nInsofar as we exist, we are envisioning a certain kind of life,\nassigning a value to our identity, and making ourselves into the kind\nof person we are.\nWhen we become aware of our freedom as an inescapable given of the\nhuman condition, the awareness is often accompanied by anxiety because\nwe realize that we alone are responsible for our choices and the\nprojects we undertake. There is no moral absolute, divine will, or\nnatural law that can provide guidance or justify our actions. We are,\nin this sense, condemned to be free because \u201cthere are no excuses\nbehind us nor justifications before us\u201d (Sartre 1946 [2001,\n296]).\n",
