    "main_text": "Foundations of Mathematics\n1. Foundations of Mathematics\n\nInconsistent Mathematics began historically with foundational\nconsiderations. Frege and Russell proposed to found their mathematics\non the naive principle of set theory: to every predicate is a set. But\nthe naive principle leads rapidly to a proof of the existence of the\nRussell set, the set of all sets not members of themselves, which both\nis and is not a member of itself. This and other set-theoretic\nparadoxes noted by Russell and others led to attempts to produce\nconsistent set theories as a foundation for mathematics. Perhaps the\nbest known of these was Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ZF. But ZF and\nothers such as NBG and the like were in various ways ad hoc, having to\ninclude multiple independent principles instead of a single simple\ncomprehension axiom. Hence, a number of people including da Costa\n(1974), Brady (1971, 1989), Priest, Routley, & Norman (1989, pp.\n152, 498), considered it preferable to retain the full power of the\nnatural comprehension principle, and tolerate a degree of\ninconsistency in set theory. Brady, in particular, has extended,\nstreamlined and simplified these results on naive set theory in his\nbook (2006). For a clear account see also Restall\u2019s review\n(2007).\n\nThese constructions require, of course, that one dispense at\nleast with that principle of Boolean logic ex contradictione\nquodlibet (ECQ) (from a contradiction every proposition may be\ndeduced, also called explosion). In passing, C.I.Lewis showed that ECQ\nfollows by a simple argument from the principle disjunctive syllogism\n(DS) (from A-or-B and not-A deduce\nB). So DS has to go too. Obviously, ECQ trivialises any\ninconsistent theory (triviality = every sentence is provable).\nNon-triviality should be regarded as a constraint on interesting\ntheories: a trivial theory is useless for mathematical calculation,\nsince a trivial theory does not distinguish principles in the theory\nfrom their negations. Similarly, considerable debate (Burgess 1981,\nMortensen 1983), made it clear that dispensing with DS was not so\ncounter-intuitive, especially when a plausible story emerged about the\nspecial conditions under which DS continues to hold.\n\nIt should also be noted that Brady\u2019s construction of\ninconsistent naive set theory opens the door to a revival of\nFrege-Russell logicism (briefly, that mathematics reduces to logic.)\nLogicism was widely held, even by Frege himself, to have been badly\ndamaged by the Russell Paradox. If the Russell Contradiction does not\nspread, then there is no obvious reason why one cannot hold that naive\nset theory provides an adequate foundation for mathematics, and that\nnaive set theory is deducible from logic via the naive comprehension\nschema. The only change needed is a move to an inconsistency-tolerant\nlogic. Even more radically, Weber, in related papers (2010), (2012),\n(2013), has taken the inconsistency to be a positive virtue, since it\nenables us to settle several questions that were left open by Cantor,\nnamely, that the well-ordering theorem and the axiom of choice are\nprovable, and that the Continuum Hypothesis is false (2012, 284). Some\nof these come out provably both true and false; wherein Weber is\nconcerned to advance proofs of the classical recapture, which\nis the project of showing that traditional results remain provable\n(2010, 72). This is invigorating new ground. Weber also showed\nsomething essential to this project, namely, that Cantor\u2019s\nTheorem continues to hold; that is, it does not depend on\noverly-strong logical principles which are contested by\nparaconsistentists. Retaining Cantor\u2019s Theorem is important in\nWeber\u2019s view, since different orders of infinity remain\navailable in inconsistent set theory.\n\nIn addition, mathematics contains machinery for a metalanguage, that\nis for talking about mathematics itself. This includes the concepts:\n(i) names for mathematical statements and other parts of syntax, (ii)\nself-reference, (iii) proof and (iv) truth. G\u00f6del\u2019s\ncontribution to the philosophy of mathematics was to show that the\nfirst three of these can be rigorously expressed in arithmetical\ntheories, albeit in theories which are either inconsistent or\nincomplete. The possibility of a well-structured example of the former\nof these two alternatives, namely inconsistency, was not taken\nseriously, again because of belief in ECQ. However, in addition\nnatural languages seem to have their own truth predicate. Combined\nwith self-reference this produces the Liar paradox, \u201cThis\nsentence is false\u201d, an inconsistency. Priest (1987) and Priest,\nRoutley and Norman (1989, p. 154) argued that the Liar had to be\nregarded as a statement both true and false, a true contradiction.\nThis represents another argument for studying inconsistent theories,\nnamely the claim that some contradictions are true, also known as\ndialetheism. Kripke (1975) proposed instead to model a truth\npredicate differently, in a consistent incomplete theory. We see below\nthat incompleteness and inconsistency are closely related.\n\nTo simplify the motivation, mathematics, like many another science,\nencounters anomalies, puzzles and paradoxes. Paradoxes typically\nappear in the form of contradictions where there are grounds for\naccepting incompatible sides of the contradiction. Mathematics\nprogresses at least in part by eliminating anomalies in favour of\nconsistent reconstructions. This has typically been the method of\naddressing anomalies, and it is facilitated by noticing that the\ncontradictions emerge in the foundations of mathematics. But it was\nnoticed in the later twentieth century that there is another way,\nnamely accept the contradiction and develop mathematical theories\ncontaining both sides of the contradiction. This would be impossible\nif the contradictory theory was erected on a logical foundation\ncontaining the Boolean principle Ex Contradictione Quodlibet ECQ, from\na contradiction everything follows. So ECQ has to be abandoned, but\nfortunetely that proves possible, indeed mathematically\nstraightforward. What remains is a rich field, of novel mathematical\napplications interesting in their own right, which sidestep the vexing\nquestions of which foundational principles to adopt, by developing\ncontradictions in areas of mathematics such as number theory or\nanalysis which are far from foundations. This is inconsistent\nmathematics.\n",
