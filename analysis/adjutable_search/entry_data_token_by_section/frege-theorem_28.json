    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions Surrounding Frege\u2019s Theorem || The Existence of Concepts\n6.3 The Existence of Concepts\n\nBoolos (1985) noted that the Rule of Substitution causes a problem of\nthis kind for Frege\u2019s program given that it is equivalent the\nComprehension Principle for Concepts. Boolos suggests a defense for\nFrege with respect to this particular aspect of his logic, namely, to\nreinterpret (by paraphrasing) the second-order quantifiers so as to\navoid commitment to concepts. (See Boolos (1985) for the details.)\nBoolos\u2019s suggestion, however, is one which would require Frege\nto abandon his realist theory of concepts. Moreover, although\nBoolos\u2019s suggestion might lead us to an epistemological\njustification of the Comprehension Principle for Concepts, it\ndoesn\u2019t do the same for the Comprehension Principle for\nRelations, for his reinterpretation of the quantifiers works only for\nthe \u2018monadic\u2019 quantifiers (i.e., those ranging over\nconcepts having one argument) and thus doesn\u2019t offer a\nparaphrase for quantification over relational concepts.\n\nAnother problem for a strategy of the type suggested by Boolos is that\nif the second-order quantifiers are interpreted so that they do not\nrange over a separate domain of entities, then there is nothing\nappropriate to serve as the denotations of \\(\\lambda\\)-expressions.\nAlthough Frege wouldn\u2019t quite put it this way, our\nreconstruction suggests that Frege treats open formulas with free\nobject variables as if they denoted concepts. Although Frege\ndoesn\u2019t use \\(\\lambda\\)-notation, the use of such notation seems\nto be the most logically perspicuous way of reconstructing his work.\nThe use of such notation faces the same epistemological puzzles that\nFrege\u2019s Rule of Substitution faces.\n\nTo see why, note that the Principle of \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion:\n\n\\(\\forall y([\\lambda x\\, \\phi ]y \\equiv \\phi^y_x)\\) \n\nseems to be an analytic truth of logic. It says this: \n\nAn object \\(y\\) exemplifies the complex property being such\nthat \\(\\phi\\) if and only if \\(y\\) is such that \\(\\phi\\). \n\nOne might argue that this is true in virtue of the very meaning of the\n\\(\\lambda\\)-expression, the meaning of \\(\\equiv\\), and the meaning of\nthe statement \\([\\lambda x\\, \\phi]y\\) (which has the form \\( Fx)\\).\nHowever, \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion also implies the Comprehension\nPrinciple for Concepts, for the latter follows from the former by\nexistential generalization: \n\n\\(\\exists F\\forall y(Fy \\equiv \\phi^y_x)\\) \n\nThe point here is that the fact that an existential claim is derivable\ncasts at least some doubt on the purely analytic status of\n\\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion. The question of how we obtain knowledge of\nsuch principles is still an open question in philosophy. It is an\nimportant question to address, since Frege\u2019s most insightful\ndefinitions are cast using quantifiers ranging over concepts and\nrelations (e.g., the ancestrals of a relation) and it would be useful\nto have a philosophical explanation of how such entities and the\nprinciples which govern them become known to us. In contemporary\nphilosophy, this question is still poignant, since many philosophers\ndo accept that properties and relations of various\nsorts exist. These entities are the contemporary analogues of\nFrege\u2019s concepts.\n",
