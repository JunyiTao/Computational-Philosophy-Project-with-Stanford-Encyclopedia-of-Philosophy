    "main_text": "Life and works\n1. Life and works\n\nEven though legendary accounts abound, very little can be said\nprecisely about N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s life. That\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna was a Buddhist monk who lived some time between\n150 and 250 CE, probably mainly in southern India is rarely disputed.\nIf we want to go beyond these bare facts, however, intricate\nhistorical detective work is required. Some interesting connections\nhave been discovered by this but they are of limited importance in the\npresent context which is primarily aimed at providing information\nabout N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s philosophical works. The interested\nreader is referred to Mabbett 1998 and Walser 2005 for further\ndiscussion.\n\nFortunately there is more information about\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works than there is about his life but the\nsituation is still far from ideal: it is not easy to come up with a\nprecise list of texts N\u0101g\u0101rjuna composed. This is partly due\nto the fact that different authors bearing the name\n\u201cN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u201d might have lived during different\nperiods of the development of Buddhist thought in India, and partly\ndue to the tendency of attributing newly composed works to the great\nauthorities of the past. For the present purposes, however, we can\ndivide N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works into three main groups\n(further discussion can be found in Ruegg 1981, Lindtner 1982). In the\nlist I give here the ascription of the works mentioned to\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna is largely uncontested. References to reliable\ntranslations into English are provided in the list of primary sources\nin the bibliography.\n\nThe argumentative works\n\n\n\n\nThe Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way (MMK)\n(M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101). This is the most\nimportant of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s works. In its 450 stanzas it\nexpounds the entire compass of his thought and constitutes the central\ntext of the \u201cphilosophy of the Middle Way\u201d. It has been\ncommented upon by a large number of later authors. (Ye 2011 provides a\nuseful edition of the Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese recensions of\nthis work). \n\n\nThe Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning\n(Yukti\u1e63a\u1e63\u1e6dik\u0101). A shorter treatise,\ndiscussing the notions of emptiness and dependent origination\n(prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da). \n\n\nThe Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness\n(\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101saptati). Another short treatise,\ndealing in addition with questions of agency and the two truths.\n\n\n\nThe Dispeller of Disputes (Vigrahavy\u0101vartan\u012b). In\nthis work of seventy verses with an autocommentary in prose\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna responds to a set of specific objections raised\nagainst his system. These objections come both from Buddhist and\nnon-Buddhist opponents and initiate discussions of topics which do not\nget much coverage in N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s other works (in\nparticular epistemology and the philosophy of language). \n\n\nThe Treatise on Pulverization (Vaidalyaprakara\u1e47a). A\nvery interesting and difficult work in which N\u0101g\u0101rjuna sets\nout to refute the logical categories of the non-Buddhist Ny\u0101ya\nschool. Like d. this text has never attracted the attention of\nclassical commentators. \n\n\nThe Precious Garland (Ratn\u0101val\u012b). A long text\naddressed to a king containing a comprehensive discussion of ethical\nquestions. Because discussion of the theory of emptiness plays a\ncomparatively minor role in this text it is sometimes subsumed under\nthe epistolary works (see below). \n \n\n\nThe hymns (Catu\u1e25stava). There is some discussion which\nof the various hymns ascribed to N\u0101g\u0101rjuna actually make up\nthe quartet of \u2018four hymns\u2019 often referred to in the\ncommentarial literature. They differ in interesting respects from the\nworks mentioned in the preceding section. Common to many of them is a\npositive conception of ultimate truth which ascribes specific\nqualities to it and gets close to the theory of Buddha-nature\n(tath\u0101gatagarbha) that became very important in the\nlater development of Buddhist thought. \n\n\nThe epistolary works. The Friendly Letter (Suh\u1e5bllekha),\nlike the Precious Garland (Ratn\u0101val\u012b), which is\nsometimes assigned to this group is a work addressed to a king. This\nfact may explain why the text is primarily concerned with ethical\nmatters. It devotes relatively little space to the kind of\nphilosophical discussion which is N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s most\ncharacteristic contribution to Buddhist thought. \n\n",
