Conclusion\n\nThe subject of reproducibility is associated with a turbulent period\nin contemporary science. This period has called for a re-evaluation of\nthe values, incentives, practices and structures which underpin\nscientific inquiry. While the meta-science has painted a bleak picture\nof reproducibility in some fields, it has also inspired a parallel\nmovement to strengthen the foundations of science. However, more\nprogress is to be made, especially in understanding the solutions to\nthe reproducibility crisis. In this regard, there are fruitful avenues\nfor future research, including a deeper exploration of the role that\nepistemic and non-epistemic values can or should play in scientific\ninquiry.\n",
