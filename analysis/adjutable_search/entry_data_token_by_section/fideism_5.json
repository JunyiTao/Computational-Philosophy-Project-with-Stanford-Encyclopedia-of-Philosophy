A Rational Fideism?\n\nIn recent years, a small number of philosophers of religion has\nembraced the term fideism (or variations thereof) and sought\nto (re-)claim its non-pejorative use. These thinkers are rare among\nphilosophers in their willingness to take up a gauntlet that is\nusually refused \u2013 even by those with views in many respects\nsimilar to their own.\n\nOne of the most carefully argued contemporary defenses of fideism is\nC. Stephen Evans\u2019s book Faith Beyond Reason. Evans\nattempts to rehabilitate \u2013 or perhaps habilitate \u2013 the term by\ndistinguishing \u201cresponsible\u201d forms of fideism from various\nirrationalistic alternatives. Whereas the latter pit faith directly\nagainst reason, the former contend that faith can\nappropriately take over where reason leaves matters of ultimate\nconcern unresolved. Drawing on Kierkegaard\u2019s thought, Evans\ncontends that while there are limits to reason, they are limits which\nit is reasonable for reason to acknowledge.\n\nLike the Protestant Reformers, Evans suggests that the customary\nexercise of human reason is limited not merely by finitude but also by\npride and self-centeredness. For this reason, faith and reason can\nfind themselves in tension. For Evans, however, \u201cfaith is\nagainst reason only in the sense that it runs into conflict with a\nconcrete form of reason that is damaged\u201d (153). Moreover, Evans\ninsists that the defects in reason \u2013 though substantial \u2013 are\nnevertheless not such as to render us completely oblivious to them.\nThus, he does not reject reason altogether. In his preferred\nterminology, faith is not so much against as beyond\nreason, since it is ultimately compatible, in his view, with a duly\nself-critical intellect.\n\nAnother recent defense of fideism can be found in John Bishop\u2019s\nbook Believing by Faith: An Essay in the Epistemology and Ethics\nof Religious Belief. Where Evans draws on Kierkegaard, Bishop\nbuilds on James\u2019s argument in \u201cThe Will to Believe\u201d\nto develop what he terms a \u201cmodest, moral coherentist,\n\u2018supra-evidential\u2019 fideism\u201d (3).\n\nA crucial premise in Bishop\u2019s argument is what he terms the\n\u201cthesis of evidential ambiguity,\u201d which holds that, under\n\u201crational empiricist evidential practice,\u201d our overall\nexperience of the world is equally plausibly interpreted on either a\ntheistic or an atheistic reading, thereby leaving open the question of\nGod\u2019s existence (70\u20131). He argues that under appropriate\nconditions \u2013 essentially those comprising what James called a\n\u201cgenuine option,\u201d together with evidential indeterminacy,\non the one hand, and the satisfaction of certain moral constraints on\none\u2019s passional motivations and the content of one\u2019s\nfaith-commitment, on the other \u2013 it is morally permissible to make\na \u201cdoxastic faith-venture\u201d \u2013 that is, to take belief\nin God to be true in one\u2019s practical reasoning, while\nrecognizing that it is not certified by one\u2019s total available\nevidence (147). The brand of fideism for which Bishop argues is thus\n\u2018supra-evidential\u2019 in the sense that it defends the\npermissibility of reasoning on the basis of commitments that outrun\nwhat is warranted on purely evidential grounds. Like Evans, and in\nkeeping with James and Pascal, however, Bishop is careful to\ndistinguish supra-evidential fideism from counter-evidential fideism:\nunlike the latter, the former, he argues, cannot be shown to violate\nany epistemic obligations. Although, unlike some putative fideists,\nBishop does not regard evidentialism as incoherent or epistemically\nirresponsible, he argues that fideism of the kind he defends is\npreferable on broadly moral grounds, suggesting, for instance, that\nfideism\u2019s tolerance for passional commitments conduces to a more\nbalanced acceptance of human nature as more than purely rational\n(216\u2013220).\n\nOne difference between these two contemporary versions of fideism is\nthat Evans focuses primarily on what is permissible in an epistemic\nsense, whereas Bishop begins with the ethics of fideistic\nbelief, by considering the justifiability in moral terms of taking\nreligious beliefs to be true in one\u2019s practical reasoning.\nUnlike holding beliefs to be true, taking them to be\ntrue in practical reasoning, Bishop argues, is subject to direct\nvoluntary control and an appropriate subject for moral evaluation.\nYet, insofar as such faith-ventures are not counter-evidential, he\nargues, they carry epistemic entitlement too.\n\nAnother difference is that Evans regards faith as justifiable in light\nof inherent limits to human rationality as such, whereas on\nBishop\u2019s account, evidential ambiguity is a feature of the world\nviewed relative to what he calls \u201cour rational empiricist\nevidential practice.\u201d The latter qualification seems to leave\nroom for other practices to which ambiguity about God\u2019s\nexistence might be foreign. Bishop raises this possibility in a\ndiscussion of \u201cisolationist\u201d epistemologies (such as\nWittgensteinian Fideism, if such a thing exists), which attempt to\nsegregate questions of evidential support for religious claims from\nthe standards of a \u201cwider, generally prevailing, evidential\npractice\u201d (79). From within what the isolationist regards as the\nappropriate practice, the \u201cevidence\u201d may seem to point\nincontrovertibly toward, e.g., theistic conclusions (or certain\npropositions about God may count as basic). However, Bishop contends\nthat insofar as questions may still arise for the reflective believer\nabout the justifiability of commitment to the framework\nprinciples of the theistic doxastic practice, isolationism cannot\navoid the need for doxastic ventures that outrun the available\nevidence. Some version of fideism thus seems unavoidable for the\nreflective believer. But granting, for the sake of the argument, that\nBishop is right about the options available to the contemporary\nreflective believer, it might nevertheless be argued that a very\ndifferent situation obtained prior to the development of rational\nempiricist evidential practice (and perhaps continues to obtain where\nthat practice has not taken root). Arguably for premodern thinkers\nthere was no question of \u201cisolating\u201d belief in God from\nany \u201cwider, generally prevailing, evidential practice,\u201d\nand thus no existential \u201cchoice\u201d to be made about which\nstandards to employ. If this is right, it provides additional support\nfor the claim that it is anachronistic to describe someone like\nTertullian as a fideist. Put differently, starting from the thesis of\nevidential ambiguity allows for the historicizing of fideism, in a way\nthat encourages us to view the possibility to which the descriptive\nuse of the term refers as contingent on particular historical\ndevelopments, rather than as perennially available \u2013 i.e., as a\ndistinctively modern response to a distinctively modern problem. (To\nwhat extent the \u201cChristian\u201d account of fideism articulated\nin Section 3 can be generalized across other traditions is\nunclear.)\n\nWhere Bishop and Evans agree is that some version of fideism\nis justifiable \u2013 on moral and/or rational grounds \u2013 even if\nwhat is believed by faith itself requires no external\nevidential support. Their quarrel is thus not with reason tout\ncourt, but with certain philosophical assumptions about belief\nentitlement.\n\nA third constructive proposal draws on a reading of Wittgenstein.\nUnlike Bishop and Evans, Duncan Pritchard rejects the term\n\u201cfideism,\u201d which he regards as implying that religious\nbeliefs are unlike other beliefs in not being capable of rational\nassessment or requiring rational support. On his account, all\nbeliefs depend for their assessment on commitments that are not\nthemselves rationally grounded. To the extent that religious beliefs\ndepend on a-rational commitments, they are thus not unique. Pritchard\ncalls his own position \u201cquasi-fideism,\u201d to distinguish it\nfrom both rationalistic conceptions and anti-rational ones. \u201cPut\nanother way, while the quasi-fideist grants that religious belief is,\nat root, a matter of faith rather than reason, she nonetheless holds\nthat this doesn\u2019t disqualify religious belief from being\nrational since all belief is, at root, a matter of faith rather than\nreason\u201d (104).\n\nIn developing this proposal, Pritchard draws on Wittgenstein\u2019s\nfinal writings collected in On Certainty. There, in a\ndiscussion of the possibility of skepticism, Wittgenstein observes\nthat \u201cthe questions that we raise and our\ndoubts depend on the fact that some propositions are exempt\nfrom doubt, are as it were like hinges on which those turn\u201d\n(1969, \u00a7341). On Pritchard\u2019s reading, these\n\u201cpropositions\u201d are not beliefs \u2013 which he\ntakes to be responsive to rational considerations \u2013 but\ncommitments of a more fundamental, practical kind.\nWittgenstein\u2019s point was a general one, but just for that\nreason, Pritchard contends, it illuminates philosophical debates about\nthe justification of \u201creligious\u201d beliefs. \u201cThe\nreligious believer\u2019s overall set of commitments \u2026 includes\nfundamental commitments which are more a matter of faith than of\nreason, but this fact alone doesn\u2019t mark any epistemically\nsignificant difference between the life of faith and a life lived\nwithout it. With the relationship between faith and reason and its\nrole in the production of rational belief understood along\nquasi-fideistic lines, religious commitment can be at its most\nfundamental level a matter of faith and yet there nonetheless be\nrational religious beliefs\u201d (118). If Pritchard is correct,\nsomething like faith is a feature of rationality, and\nso-called religious faith is epistemically on par with a-rational\ncommitments in other domains.\n\nOne question for this approach is whether the \u201chinge\ncommitments\u201d operative in religious or other contexts are\ncognitive or not. Some interpreters of Wittgenstein, like Rupert Read\nand Alice Crary, hold that the forms of words to which Wittgenstein\nrefers in On Certainty lack any application and so are\nnonsense. A different reading, advanced by, inter alia, Dani\u00e8le\nMoyal-Sharrock, holds that the hinges are not empty propositions\nbecause they are not propositions at all; rather, they are\nphenomenological descriptions of \u201cthe mindless, animal certainty\nwith which we move about in the world\u201d (67). On neither account\nis Wittgenstein taken to be advancing a form of \u201cersatz\nfoundationalism\u201d (Read, 312), according to which certain beliefs\nare properly basic. Nor does either reading entail that there is a set\nof substantive propositions available for being appropriately held\n\u201con faith\u201d \u2013 i.e., that there is something to be\nfideistic about. One way of holding together\nPritchard\u2019s quasi-fideism with Moyal Sharrock\u2019s\ninterpretation of Wittgenstein might be to regard so-called religious\nfaith as an orientation, rather than as propositional \u2013 i.e., as\nexpressing a practical understanding of reality within which the\n\u201cbeliever\u201d lives and moves and has her being.\n",
