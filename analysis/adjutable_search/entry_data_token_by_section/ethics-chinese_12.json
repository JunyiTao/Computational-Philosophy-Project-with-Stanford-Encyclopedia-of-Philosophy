Legalism (Fajia)\n\nThinkers grouped under what is known in China as the Fajia\n\u6cd5\u5bb6 or Fa tradition are usually known in\nthe West as \u201dLegalists.\u201c This is misleading in that while the term\nfa can mean law, it can also include standards, norms,\nmodels, and methods (see Goldin 2005c, and the entry on \n legalism in Chinese philosophy).\n The English term is also misleading if taken to refer to thinkers who\nshared in common a cohesive set of doctrines when in fact the thinkers\ngrouped under the name have a fairly diverse set of\nideas. Nevertheless, there are some themes that are reasonably\nassociated with some of the most prominent thinkers. One theme is\nperhaps best introduced as the opposite reaction to Analects\n2.3, in which Confucius says that guiding the people by edicts and\nkeeping them in line with punishments will keep them out of trouble\nbut will give them no sense of shame; guiding them by virtue and\nkeeping them in line with the rites will not only give them a sense of\nshame but enable them to reform themselves. In the most prominent\nFajia text, the Hanfeizi (Hanfei lived during the\n3rd century B.C.E. For a translation, see Watson 2003), the\npeople are characterized as far too swayed by their material interests\nto be guided by a sense of shame. People must be guided by clear\nedicts and strong punishments. Furthermore, rulers must be wary of\ntheir ambitious ministers and take care not to reveal their own likes\nand dislikes so as not to be manipulated by their scheming\nsubordinates. As to rulers themselves, it is a mistake to found\ngovernment on the presumption that they are or can become virtuous.\nWhile exceptionally good and exceptionally evil rulers have existed,\nthe vast majority of rulers have been mediocre. Governments must be\nstructured so that it can run satisfactorily, because that is what\nrulers will be like almost always.\n\nThe Confucians held that the remedy to China\u2019s turmoil and chaos\nlay in wise and morally excellent rulers\u2014that moral excellence\nwould ripple downwards from the top and create harmony and prosperity.\nThe Daodejing upholds a vision of an original harmony that\nhuman beings once had, a way that consisted in living in accord with\nthe natural grain of things, and that involves seeking only what one\ntruly needs, not in multiplying useless desires that only agitate and\nultimately make us unhappy. Many in\nthe Fa tradition reject moral and spiritual\ntransformation, of either the Confucian or Laoist kind, as the\nsolution to China\u2019s troubles. Most human beings will remain\nunlovely beings to the end, and governmental structures must be\ndesigned for such beings. Hanfei recommended a highly centralized\ngovernment in which the ruler retains firm control of the \u201dtwo\nhandles\u201c of government: punishment and favor (chapter 7). By\nmaking sure he always has his own hands on these handles, the ruler\nremains in firm control of his ministers. If a minister proposes a way\nto get something done, measure his performance on whether he gets it\ndone in the way he says he will. If not, punish him. The ruler is to\nhold his officials strictly to the definitions of their role\nresponsibilities, so that they are punished not only when they fail to\nperform some of those assigned responsibilities but also when they do\nmore than their assigned responsibilities.\n\nSome of the most interesting parts of the text consist of arguments\nsupporting the necessity of governmental structure and the folly of\ndepending on the character of rulers. It\u2019s not just that virtue\nis a rare thing. Even if it appears in a ruler, it is not by itself\nsufficient for achieving a good society. The \u201dFive Vermin\u201c\nchapter (49) does not dispute an assumption that is commonly held\nacross Chinese philosophical schools\u2014that the sage-kings of\nancient times were virtuous and ruled over a harmonious and prosperous\nsociety. It disputes, however, that their virtue was the primary cause\nof this golden age. What about those kings in more recent times who\nwere ren and yi, benevolent and righteous, and who\ngot wiped out for their trouble? Virtue by itself is not the\nexplanation of success or failure. The explanation has much more to do\nwith the scarcity of goods in relation to the number of people. It\nfurther has to do with whether the right sort of structure of roles\nwith attendant powers and privileges is put into place. This structure\ncan optimize the effectiveness of, and limit the damage done by,\npeople who are not especially virtuous or extraordinarily able.\n\nConfucians can give replies to such arguments. In answer to the\nargument that virtue is too rare a thing to depend upon, the most\nobvious reply is that they never promised virtue would be easy.\nIndeed, the canonical texts all stress the difficulty of achieving\nfull virtue. Mencius in particular conceives of moral development as\nextending the natural beginnings of virtue to situations where they\nought to extend but do not currently extend. Confucians might also\nobject that good results will follow from the kind of structure\ndescribed in the Hanfeizi only if persons of good-enough\ncharacter staff it. The Hanfeizi sometimes implicitly\nacknowledges this point and integrates it with a reasonable stress on\nstructure and impersonal administration. In chapter 6 there is\ndiscussion of what is necessary to compensate for a mediocre ruler:\ngetting able people with the right motives to serve that ruler.\nInstitute laws and regulations specifying how these people are\nselected: not on the basis of reputation alone, since that will give\npeople an incentive to curry favor with their associates and\nsubordinates and disregard the ruler; not on the basis of cliques,\nsince that will motivate people only to establish connections rather\nthan acquire the qualifications to perform in office. Specify the\nqualifications clearly in laws and regulations, appoint, promote, and\ndismiss strictly according to these specifications. The law, not the\nruler\u2019s personal views, must form the basis for these actions.\nIn chapter 43, consideration is given to the suggestion that those who\ntake heads in battle should be rewarded with desirable offices. This\nis rejected in cases where the office requires wisdom and ability\nrather than courage. In the end, one wonders whether a good number of\nsuch persons of right motive, competence, courage, wisdom and ability\nare enough, given the highly centralized nature of the government\nrecommended in the Hanfeizi. A lot depends on the ruler who\nwields the \u201dtwo handles\u201c of government. Taken in moderate\ndoses, Hanfeizi arguably provides a needed corrective to the\nConfucian emphasis on character. Structure can be designed with an eye\nto the realistic possibilities for mediocre and bad rulers. The\nConfucian emphasis on discretion in judgment is obviously subject to\nabuse that can be checked by structures that provide a degree of\nimpersonal administration and consistent application of relatively\nclear laws and regulations. The American legal experience seems to\nshow, however, that no set of laws can interpret itself with an eye to\ncomplex situations that are unforeseeable when laws are framed.\nUltimately, stable character and wise discretion are needed.\n\nThe strongest challenge that Legalism raises to virtue ethics is not\nthat stable virtues are impossible to achieve, but that they are not\nrealistic possibilities for most persons, and that therefore lofty\nvirtue ideals cannot provide the basis for a large-scale social ethic.\nEven if these ideals are directed only at an elite that is then\nexpected to lead the rest of the people, the question arises as to\nwhat influence this elite can have on the rest if the majority do not\nhave some attraction to virtue. It is dubious, however, that the\nsolution lies in seeking to make character irrelevant.
