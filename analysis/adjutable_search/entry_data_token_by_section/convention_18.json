    "main_text": "Alternative treatments of convention || Millikan: patterns sustained by weight of precedent\n6.3 Millikan: patterns sustained by weight of precedent\n\n\nRuth Millikan (2005) offers a radical alternative to the views surveyed\nso far. She draws inspiration not from economics or sociology but from\nbiology. On her view, a convention is a pattern of behavior\nreproduced within a population due largely to weight of\nprecedent. To say that an instance of some pattern\n\u201creproduces\u201d previous instances is to say that, if the\nprevious instance had been different, the current instance would be\ncorrespondingly different. Many patterns of behavior are\n\u201creproduced\u201d in this sense, such as the propensity to greet\none another by shaking hands in a certain way. However, not all\nreproduced patterns are conventions. For instance, we learn from our\nparents to open stuck jars by immersing them in hot water, but our\nreproduction of this pattern is not a convention. To count as a\nconvention, a reproduced pattern must be reproduced, in large part,\nsimply because it is a precedent, not because of its intrinsic merits.\nThus, a convention is unlikely to emerge independently in different\npopulations, in contrast with a pattern such as immersing stuck jars in\nhot water.\n\n\nThrough what mechanisms does convention spread \u201cby weight of\nprecedent\u201d? Millikan mentions several ideas: lack of imagination,\ndesire to conform, playing it safe by sticking with what has worked.\nThe use of chopsticks in the East and forks in the West illustrates how\nobeying precedent is often the most practical policy, since these\nrespective implements are more readily available in the respective\nlocations.\n\n\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of Millikan\u2019s discussion is\nthat it assigns no essential role to rationality in sustaining\nconventions. For instance, a society in which people maintain a\nconvention simply from unreflective conformism would satisfy\nMillikan\u2019s definition. The tradition established by Hume and\ncontinued by Lewis seeks to explain how social order emerges from the\nrational decisions of individual agents. Millikan rejects that\ntradition. To some extent, Burge also departs from the tradition,\nwriting that \u201cthe stability of conventions is safeguarded not\nonly by enlightened self-interest, but by inertia, superstition, and\nignorance\u201d (p. 253). However, Millikan\u2019s position is more\nextreme than Burge\u2019s, since she assigns reason no role in\nsustaining convention. In other words, whereas Burge apparently thinks\nthat convention rests upon both rational and irrational underpinnings,\nMillikan does not acknowledge any rational underpinnings.\n",
