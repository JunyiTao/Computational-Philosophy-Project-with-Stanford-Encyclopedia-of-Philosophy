    "main_text": "Recent History of Methodological Naturalism || Recent Background\n2.1 Recent Background\n\n\nContemporary interest in naturalism stems from Quine, whose naturalism\nis prominent in his later works. A representative quotation is that\nnaturalism is \u2018the recognition that it is within science itself,\nand not in some prior philosophy, that reality is to be identified and\ndescribed\u2019 (Quine 1981, 21). Another major influence is Hilary Putnam, who articulates his scientific naturalism as follows:\n\n\n\u2026it is silly to agree that a reason for believing that\np warrants accepting p in all scientific\ncircumstances, and then to add \u2018but even so it is not good\nenough.\u2019 Such a judgement could only be made if one\naccepted a trans-scientific method as superior to the scientific\nmethod; but this philosopher, at least, has no interest in\ndoing that. (Putnam 1971, 356)\n\n\nThus from this perspective mathematics is judged by scientific standards because\neverything is. Moreover, Quine and Putnam maintain that these\nstandards sanction platonist mathematics because mathematics and its\nplatonist construal are an indispensable part of our best scientific\ntheories.\n\n\nAlthough naturalism as a self-conscious position in the philosophy of\nmathematics emerges most fully with Quine there are, as always,\nprecursors. The empiricist tradition in its various guises (logical\npositivism, Mill, Hume, etc.) is the most obvious precursor, though\nthere are significant differences between pre-Quinean empiricists and\ncontemporary naturalists. The rise of scientific naturalism in the\nphilosophy of mathematics also coincides with a rise in a broader\nscientific naturalism, also in part attributable to Quine, which sees\nall philosophy\u2014not just philosophy of mathematics\u2014as\ntaking place within natural science. Naturalism also goes hand in hand\nwith a now generally prevalent pessimism about traditional\nphilosophical modes of argumentation.\n\n\nSome version of naturalism is attractive to virtually all\nphilosophers today. That the methodologies of mathematics and science are the\nbest we have seems a platitude, which philosophy should try to\nacknowledge and build on rather than ignore. The question is how\nexactly to do so.\n",
