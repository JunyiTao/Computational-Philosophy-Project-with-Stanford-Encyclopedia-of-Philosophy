    "main_text": "Life and Philosophical Development || Launching Out\n3.1 Launching Out\n\n\nIn 1932, at the age of 17, Prior left his home town, sleepy\nMasterton in the North Island of New Zealand, to become a student at\nthe University of Otago in the South Island city of Dunedin. He seemed\nto prefer the South Island, saying the North Island gave him \u2018the\nwillies\u2019. The son of a doctor, he initially planned a career as a\nbiologist, but was soon beckoned away by theology and philosophy,\ngraduating from Otago in 1935 with a B.A. in philosophy. At Otago he\nhad thoughts of entering the ministry of the Presbyterian Church, and\nhe was accepted into the required program of study. \u2018Who\u2019,\nhe had asked himself in a 1931 manuscript, \u2018are the greatest\nthinkers the world has known?\u2019\u2014answering \u2018I have no\nhesitation in placing JESUS OF NAZARETH at the top of this list\u2019\n(Prior 1931: 107). In 1936, he abandoned the idea of entering the\nministry, although he did subsequently work for a time as a locum\nminister in Birmingham, England, during his \u2018bohemian\nperiod\u2019 at the end of the 1930s.\n\n\nIt was John Findlay, Professor of Philosophy at Otago, who\nintroduced Prior to logic. Findlay, a contemporary of Gilbert Ryle and\nWilliam Kneale, had studied at Oxford and at Graz; his influential book\nMeinong\u2019s Theory of Objects and Values was published\nduring Prior\u2019s second year at Otago. Under Findlay\u2019s\ndirection, Prior studied the 18th century British moralists\nand cut his teeth on W.E. Johnson\u2019s classic text Logic.\nIt was Findlay who first aroused his interest in the history of logic.\nIn correspondence, Prior described Findlay\u2019s Otago lectures as\n\u2018thrilling\u2019, and remarked that his offprint of\nFindlay\u2019s 1936 article \u2018Relational Properties\u2019 was\none of his \u2018most valued literary possessions\u2019. In 1949 he\nwrote of Findlay, \u2018I owe to his teaching, directly or indirectly,\nalmost all that I know of either Logic or Ethics\u2019 (1949: xi), and\nhe was later generously to describe Findlay as \u2018the founding\nfather of modern tense-logic\u2019 (1967a: 1).\n\n\nIn 1936, the year following his graduation, Prior married. It was a\nwhirlwind romance. In a letter written at the beginning of June 1936,\nhe said he was \u2018taking an interest in a rather desperate & in\nsome ways rather dangerous little friend\u2019, adding that he had\nbeen solemnly advised \u2018not to fall in love\u2019 with her. The\nrather dangerous Clare Hunter, an up-and-coming freelance reporter for\nthe Otago Daily Times, was a feminist and free thinker. She\nencouraged Prior in what he called his \u2018innate\nBohemianism\u2019. Before July was out, the two were planning to\n\u2018get quietly married at the end of the year\u2019, wrote Prior.\nThis must soon have seemed too long a wait, for they wed the very next\nmonth. (There is a thumbnail biography of Hunter in Grimshaw\n(2018).)\n\n\nPrior gained his M.A. in philosophy in 1937. His thesis, criticizing\nvarious philosophical approaches to logic, involved him in reading\n\u2018a lot about Wittgenstein & certain kindred writers\u2019,\nincluding Karl Popper. But the thesis was awarded only a second by the\nexternal examiner. Fortunately, Findlay knew a budding logician when he\nsaw one, and secured Prior a one-year assistant lectureship at Otago.\nDuring the 1937 academic year Prior gave courses on logic, ethics, and\nprobability theory. Findlay pressed him to contribute to the\nAustralasian Journal of Psychology and Philosophy, and\nPrior\u2019s \u2018The Nation and the Individual\u2019 (influenced\nby John Wisdom) became his first published paper in philosophy, in\nDecember 1937. (Prior\u2019s earlier theological writings are\ndiscussed in Hasle (1999) and (2012), Grimshaw (2002), and Jakobsen\n(2012) and (2016).) Prior mentioned \u2018The Nation and the\nIndividual\u2019 and its origins in a 1937 letter:\n\n\n\nThe view of Philosophy as \u2018analysis\u2019 (to which\nWittgenstein & co. have made important contributions) has proved\nremarkably fruitful in the fields of Logic, Ethics, Physics, Psychology\n& Metaphysics; but I would like to see it applied\u2014& I\nthink it is capable of very fruitful application\u2014in Theology,\nSociology, Economics & Political Ethics. \u2026 I\u2019m\n\u2026 trying a little work along those lines at present\nmyself\u2014figuring out the consequences of treating a Nation as what\nthese champions of \u2018Analysis\u2019 call a \u2018logical\nconstruction\u2019.\n\n",
