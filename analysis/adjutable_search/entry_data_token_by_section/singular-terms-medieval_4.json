    "main_text": "Synonymy, Metaphor, and Equivocation\n5. Synonymy, Metaphor, and Equivocation \n\n\nProper names were allowed to exhibit the features of common nouns in\nvarious respects.  For instance, they could be used\nmetaphorically. Aquinas mentions the use of \u2018Achilles\u2019 to\nrefer to strong men, and others used \u2018Nero\u2019 as an example\nof cruel men. More importantly, \u2018Marcus\u2019 and\n\u2018Tullius\u2019, as two names of the Roman orator Marcus Tullius\nCicero, were favourite examples of synonymous terms.  As such they\nfeatured in discussions of the problem of intentional contexts.  The\nearly thirteenth century theologian Praepositinus of Cremona discussed\nthe relation between the speaker\u2019s understanding and the signification\nof a proposition in the situation where a man knows Marcus, but does\nnot know that he is also called Tullius, and hence believes that the\nsentence \u201cHe is Tullius\u201d (said by someone pointing to\nMarcus Tullius) is false. A century later Walter Burley asked whether\none could infer that a person knows that Tullius is running, given\nthat he knows that Marcus is running, and given that Marcus is\nTullius.\n\n\nThe most interesting issues arise in the context of equivocal\nterms. These were divided into two kinds, chance equivocals, and\ndeliberate equivocals. In the first case, the occurrences of the\nequivocal term were totally unconnected, but in the second case, some\nintention on the part of the speakers was involved, and the\noccurrences of the equivocal term could be related in various\nways. From classical times onward, proper names such as\n\u2018Ajax\u2019 and \u2018Alexander\u2019 provided standard\nexamples of equivocal terms. However, it was obvious that there were\nreasons for giving one proper name rather than another, and Aquinas,\nfor instance, gave an elaborate list of such reasons. This suggested\nto at least some authors that proper names need not be regarded as\nchance equivocals. In his commentary on the Categories, Paul of\nVenice claimed that some names were purely equivocal, and he instanced\n\u2018Aristotle\u2019 and \u2018Plato\u2019. However, if several\nmen were called John because they were born on the Feast of St. John,\nthe name \u2018John\u2019 should be regarded as a univocal term. He\noverlooked the distinction made by his contemporary, John Dorp,\nbetween a common reason for giving the same name to two children, and\nthe different singular concepts which that name signified. Dorp argued\nthat a common reason was not enough for univocity. In the sixteenth\ncentury, Domingo de Soto used the newly-rediscovered commentary on the\nCategories by Philoponus (attributed wrongly to Ammonius) to\nintroduce a new type of deliberate equivocal, \u2018from hope and\nmemory\u2019. One might call one\u2019s son Plato in the hope of his\nbecoming a philosopher, or Nicomachus in memory of one\u2019s father or\nCharles in honour of the Emperor.\n\n\nWhile almost everyone except Paul of Venice agreed that proper names\nmust always be equivocal when used of two different people, not\neveryone wanted to say that they were univocal when used of the same\nperson. Except for Roger Bacon, who thought of proper names as\nconstantly receiving new impositions (see \u00a77), the reason had to\ndo with the definition of a univocal term as involving a concept or a\nnature predicable, at least in principle, of several individuals.  The\nusual solution was simply to redefine \u2018univocal\u2019 so that\nproper names were included, but the Categories commentaries of\nAlbert of Saxony, Marsilius of Inghen and Paul of Venice contain\nfairly extensive discussions of the issue. Both Albert and Paul agreed\nin opposition to Marsilius that a proper name could be equivocal\nwithout being called univocal when used of one person.\n\n\nAn issue to do with the grammatical properties of proper names was\nwhether they could be pluralized or quantified. Most people said that\nno plural could be grammatically correct, and that such phrases as\n\u2018every Socrates\u2019 were ill-formed, but various logicians in\nlate fourteenth-century Oxford pointed out that such locutions as\n\u201cThere are several Roberts\u201d or \u2018every William\u2019\nhad their uses in ordinary speech, even if they were somewhat\ndeviant. The use of demonstratives with proper names could also pose a\nproblem. Domingo de Soto remarked that in the case where there are\nseveral people called Peter in the room, and we want to distinguish\nthis Peter from that Peter we may speak of this or that Peter, but in\nthe mind, where there are no equivocal concepts, the singular concept\ncorresponding to a proper name cannot properly be further\nsingularized, any more than it can be universalized.\n",
