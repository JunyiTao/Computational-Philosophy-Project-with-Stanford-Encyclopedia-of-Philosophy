    "main_text": "Challenges to the Replicator || Reproducers\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe idea that evolution by natural selection requires the existence of\nreplicators has been a very useful heuristic in evolutionary\nbiology, but also a way of motivating the application of an\nevolutionary thinking beyond the boundaries of evolutionary biology.\nWe started by showing how the notion of gene can be abstracted away\nfrom its physical basis and characterized in purely informational\nterms. We then showed how Dawkins and Hull pursued this abstraction\nand attempted to free the gene from its biological substrate. This\nmotivated responses both from proponents of the replicator concept,\nwho furthered the abstraction, and also critics. As successful and\ninspiring as such an abstraction has been, it should not be reified:\nevolution by natural selection and adaptation can occur even in the\nabsence of replicators. High fidelity certainly facilitates adaptive\nevolution, but this might be because replicators are themselves the\nproduct of evolution rather than necessary for it.\n",
