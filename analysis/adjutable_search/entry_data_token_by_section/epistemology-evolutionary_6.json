    "main_text": "Formal Models\n2. Formal Models\n\nEvery scientific enterprise requires formal and semi-formal models\nwhich allow the quantitative characterization of its objects of study.\nThe attempt to transform the philosophical study of knowledge into a\nscientific discipline which approaches knowledge as a biological\nphenomenon is no different. Much of the evolutionary epistemology\nliterature has been concerned with how to conceive of knowledge as a\nnatural phenomenon, what difference this would make to our\nunderstanding of our place in the world, and with answering objections\nto the project. There are, as well, a number of more technical\nprojects which attempt to provide the theoretical tools necessary for\na naturalistic epistemology. \n",
