    "main_text": "\n\nThe thermodynamic time asymmetry is one of the most salient and\nconsequential features of the physical universe. Heat flows from hot\nto cold, never the reverse. The smell of coffee spreads throughout its\navailable volume, never the reverse. Car engines convert fuel energy\ninto work and thermal energy, never the reverse. And so on. The\nscience of thermodynamics is able to capture these generalizations as\nconsequences of its claim that systems spontaneously evolve to future\nequilibrium states but do not spontaneously evolve away from\nequilibrium states. This generalization covers an amazing amount of\nmacroscopic physics and is rightly celebrated as one of the great laws\nof physics.\n\nDespite its familiarity, however, the thermodynamic arrow of time\nraises many deep questions relevant to both philosophy and the\nfoundations of physics. This entry concentrates on two of them. In\ncontemporary parlance, they are each questions about grounding. (1)\nWhat grounds the thermodynamic asymmetry in time? In a world possibly\ngoverned at bottom by time-symmetric laws, how do the time-asymmetric\nlaws of thermodynamics arise? (2) Does the thermodynamic time\nasymmetry ground any other temporal asymmetries? Does it account, for\ninstance, for the fact that we know more about the past than the\nfuture? The discussion thus divides between thermodynamics being an\nexplanandum or explanans. What grounds the thermodynamic asymmetry,\nand given the asymmetry, what does it ground?\n",
