    "main_text": "The Human Genome Project: From Genomics to Postgenomics || Map First, Sequence Later\n1.1 Map First, Sequence Later\n\nThe idea of sequencing the entire human genome arose in the U.S. in\nthe mid-1980s and is attributed to University of California at Santa\nCruz chancellor Robert Sinsheimer, Salk Institute researcher Renato\nDulbecco, and the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE\u2019s) Charles\nDeLisi. While the idea found supporters among prominent molecular\nbiologists and human geneticists such as Walter Bodmer, Walter\nGilbert, Leroy Hood, Victor McKusick, and James D. Watson, many of\ntheir colleagues expressed misgivings. There were concerns among\nmolecular biologists about the routine nature of sequencing and the\namount of \u201cjunk DNA\u201d that would be sequenced, that the\nexpense and big science approach would drain resources from smaller\nand more worthy projects, and that knowledge of gene sequence was\ninadequate to yield knowledge of gene function (Davis and Colleagues\n1990).\n\nCommittees established to study the feasibility of a publicly funded\nproject to sequence the human genome released reports in 1988 that\nresponded to these concerns. The Office for Technology Assessment\nreport, Mapping Our Genes: Genome Projects: How Big, How\nFast? downplayed the concerns of scientist critics by emphasizing\nthat there was not one but many genome projects, that these were not\non the scale of the Manhattan or Apollo projects, that no agency was\ncommitted to massive sequencing, and that the study of other organisms\nwas needed to understand human genes. The National Research Council\nreport, Mapping and Sequencing the Human Genome, sought to\naccommodate the scientists\u2019 concerns by formulating\nrecommendations that genetic and physical mapping and the development\nof cheaper, more efficient sequencing technologies precede large-scale\nsequencing, and that funding be provided for the mapping and\nsequencing of nonhuman (\u201cmodel\u201d) organisms as well. Genome\nprojects were underway even before the Office for Technology\nAssessment and National Research Council reports were released. The\nDOE made the first push toward a \u201cbig science\u201d genome\nproject, with DeLisi advancing a five-year plan in 1986. The DOE\nundertaking produced consternation among biomedical researchers who\nwere traditionally supported by the National Institutes of\nHealth\u2019s (NIH\u2019s) intramural and extramural programs, and\nJames Wyngaarden, head of the NIH, was persuaded to lend his\nagency\u2019s support to the project in 1987. Congressional funding\nfor both agencies was in place in time for fiscal year 1988. The\nNational Research Council report estimated the total cost of the HGP\nat $3 billion.\n\nThe DOE and NIH coordinated their efforts with a Memorandum of\nUnderstanding in 1988 that agreed on an official launch of the Human\nGenome Project on October 1, 1990 and an expected date of completion\nof 2005. The DOE established three genome centers in 1988\u201389: at\nLawrence Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore, and Los Alamos National\nLaboratories. David Smith led the DOE-HGP at the outset; he was\nfollowed by David Galas from 1990 to 1993, and Ari Patrinos for the\nremainder of the project. The NIH instituted a university grant-based\nprogram for human genome research and placed Watson, co-discoverer of\nthe structure of DNA and director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, in\ncharge in 1988. In October 1989, Watson assumed the helm of the newly\nestablished National Center for Human Genome Research (NCHGR) at the\nNIH. During 1990 and 1991, Watson expanded the grants-based program to\nfund seven genome centers for five-year periods to work on large-scale\nmapping projects: Washington University, St. Louis; University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco; Massachusetts Institute of Technology;\nUniversity of Michigan; University of Utah; Baylor College of\nMedicine; and Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Francis\nCollins succeeded Watson in 1993, establishing an intramural research\nprogram at the NCHGR to complement the extramural program of grants\nfor university-based research that already existed. In 1997, the NCHGR\nwas elevated to the status of a research institute and renamed the\nNational Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).\n\nAlthough the HGP\u2019s inceptions were in the U.S., it did not take\nlong for mapping and sequencing the human genome to become an\ninternational venture (see Cook-Deegan 1994). France began to fund\ngenome research in 1988 and had developed a more centralized, although\nnot very well-funded, program by 1990. More significant were the\ncontributions of Centre d\u2019Etudes du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)\nand G\u00e9n\u00e9thon. CEPH, founded in 1983 by Jean Dausset,\nmaintained a collection of DNA donated by intergenerational families\nto help in the study of hereditary disease; in 1991, with funding from\nthe French muscular dystrophy association, CEPH director Daniel Cohen\noversaw the launching of G\u00e9n\u00e9thon as an industrial-sized\nmapping and sequencing operation. The U.K.\u2019s genome project\nreceived its official start in 1989, though Sydney Brenner had\ncommenced genome research at the Medical Research Council laboratory\nseveral years before this. Medical Research Council funding was\nsupplemented with private monies from the Imperial Cancer Research\nFund and, later, the Wellcome Trust. The Sanger Centre, led by John\nSulston and funded by Wellcome and the Medical Research Council,\nopened in October 1993. Japan, ahead of the U.S. in having funded the\ndevelopment of automated sequencing technologies since the early\n1980s, was the major genome player outside the U.S. and Europe with\nseveral government agencies beginning small-scale genome projects in\nthe late-1980s and early-1990s (Swinbanks 1991). Germany and China\nsubsequently joined the U.S., France, U.K., and Japan in the publicly\nfunded international consortium that was ultimately responsible for\nsequencing the genome.\n\nThe NIH and DOE released a joint five-year plan in 1990 that set\nspecific benchmarks for mapping, sequencing, and technological\ndevelopment. The plan was updated in 1993 to accommodate progress that\nhad been made, with the new five-year plan in effect through 1998\n(Collins and Galas 1993). As the National Research Council report had\nrecommended, priority at the outset of the project was given to\nmapping rather than sequencing the human genome. HGP scientists sought\nto construct two kinds of maps: genetic maps and physical maps.\nGenetic maps order polymorphic markers linearly on chromosomes; the\naim is to have these markers densely enough situated that linkage\nrelations can be used to locate chromosomal regions containing genes\nof interest to researchers. Physical maps order collections (or\n\u201clibraries\u201d) of cloned DNA fragments that cover an\norganism\u2019s genome; these fragments can then be replicated in\nquantity for sequencing. Technological progress was needed to make\nsequencing more efficient and less costly for any significant progress\nto be made. For the meantime, efforts would focus on sequencing the\nsmaller genomes of less complex model organisms (Watson 1990). The\nmodel organisms selected for the project were the bacterium\nEscherichia coli, the yeast Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae, the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, the\nfruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, and the mouse Mus\nmusculans.\n\nAs 1998, the last year of the revised five-year plan and midpoint of\nthe project\u2019s projected 15-year span, approached, many mapping\ngoals had been met. In 1994, G\u00e9n\u00e9thon completed a\ngenetic map with more than 2,000 microsatellite markers at an average\nspacing of 2.9 centimorgans (cM) and only one gap larger than 20 cM\n(Gyapay et al. 1994); the goal was a resolution of 2 to 5 cM by 2005.\nThe genetic mapping phase of the project came to a final close in\nMarch 1996 with G\u00e9n\u00e9thon\u2019s completion of a genetic\nmap containing 5,264 microsatellite markers located to 2,335 positions\nwith an average spacing of 1.6 cM (Dib et al. 1996). In 1995, a\nphysical map with 94 percent coverage of the genome and 15,086\nsequence-tagged site (STS) markers at average intervals of 199\nkilobases (kb) was published (Hudson et al. 1995); the initial goal\nwas STS markers spaced approximately 100 kb apart by 1995, a deadline\nthe revised plan extended to 1998. In 1998, a physical map of 41,664\nSTS markers was published (Deloukas et al. 1998). Sequencing presented\nmore of a challenge, despite ramped-up sequencing efforts over the\nprevious several years at the U.K.\u2019s Wellcome Trust-funded\nSanger Centre in Cambridge and the NHGRI (previously NCHGR)-funded\ncenters at Houston\u2019s Baylor College of Medicine, Stanford\nUniversity, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), University of\nWashington-Seattle, Washington University School of Medicine in St.\nLouis, and Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research/MIT Genome\nCenter. The genomes of the smallest model organisms had been\nsequenced. In April 1996, an international consortium of mostly\nEuropean laboratories published the sequence for S.\ncerevisiae which was the first eukaryote completed, with 12\nmillion base pairs and 5,885 genes and at a cost of $40 million\n(Goffeau et al. 1996). In January 1997, University of Wisconsin\nresearchers completed the sequence of E. coli with 4,638,858\nbase pairs and 4,286 genes (Blattner et al. 1997). However, with only\nthree percent of the human genome sequenced, sequencing costs hovering\nat $.40/base, and the desired high output not yet achieved by the\nsequencing centers, and about $1.8 billion spent, doubts existed about\nwhether the HGP\u2019s target date of 2005 could be met.\n",
