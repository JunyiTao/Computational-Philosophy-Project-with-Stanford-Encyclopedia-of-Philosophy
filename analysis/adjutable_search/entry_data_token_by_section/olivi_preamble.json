    "main_text": "\n\nPeter John Olivi was one of the most original and interesting\nphilosophers and theologians of the thirteenth century. Although not\nas clear and systematic as Thomas Aquinas, and not as brilliantly\nanalytical as John Duns Scotus, Olivi\u2019s ideas are equally\noriginal and provocative, and their philosophical value is nowadays\nrecognized among the specialists in medieval philosophy. He is\nprobably best known for his psychological theories, especially his\nvoluntarist conception of the freedom of the will, but his influence\nextends also to other areas of philosophy, from metaphysics to\npractical philosophy.\n",
