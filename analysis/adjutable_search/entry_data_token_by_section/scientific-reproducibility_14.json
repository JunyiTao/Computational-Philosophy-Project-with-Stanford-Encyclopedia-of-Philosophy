Open Science Reforms: Values, Tone, and Scientific Norms\n\nThe aforementioned meta-science has unearthed a range of problems\nwhich give rise to the reproducibility crisis, and the open science\nmovement has proposed or promoted various solutions\u2014or\nreforms\u2014for these problems. These reforms can be grouped into\nfour categories: (a) methods and training, (b) reporting and\ndissemination, (c) peer review processes, and (d) evaluating new\nincentive structures (loosely following the categories used by\nMunaf\u00f2 et al. 2017 and Ioannidis et al. 2015). In subsections\n4.1\u20134.4 below, we present a non-exhaustive list of initiatives\nin each of the above categories. These initiatives are reflections of\nvarious values and norms that are at the heart of the open science\nmovement, and we discuss these values and norms in 4.5.\n",
