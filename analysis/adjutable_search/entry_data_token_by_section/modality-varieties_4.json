    "main_text": "Metaphysical and Nomic Modality\n2. Metaphysical and Nomic Modality\n\nIt often seems very natural to use modal terminology when talking\nabout the laws of nature. We are inclined to say that nothing\ncan move faster than light to express the fact that the laws\nrule out superluminal motion, and to state Newton\u2019s First Law by\nsaying that an object cannot depart from uniform rectilinear\nmotion unless acted on by an external force. This motivates the\nthought that there is a form of necessity associated with the natural\n laws.[8]\n It is controversial, however, whether that form of necessity is\nsimply metaphysical necessity, or another kind of necessity. The\nformer view is taken by necessitarians (Swoyer 1982;\nShoemaker 1980, 1998; Tweedale 1984; Fales 1993; Ellis 2001; Bird\n2005), who believe that the laws (or the laws conditionalized on the\nexistence of the properties mentioned in them) are metaphysically\nnecessary. Contingentists deny that, but many contingentists\nhold that there is a kind of necessity distinct from metaphysical\nnecessity that is characteristic of the laws (e.g., Fine 2002), and\nwhich may be called natural or nomic necessity. It\nis often assumed that nomic necessity is a weaker form of necessity\nthan metaphysical necessity: it attaches to the laws and to all truths\nthat are metaphysically necessitated by them, so that anything that is\nmetaphysically necessary is also nomically necessary, but not vice\nversa.\n\nNecessitarians have given several arguments for their position. Here\nare two.\n\nThe argument from causal essentialism (e.g., Shoemaker 1980,\n1998). Some philosophers believe that the causal powers that a\nproperty confers on its instances are essential to it. Assuming that\ncausal laws describe the causal powers associated with properties, it\nfollows that these laws (or versions of them that are conditionalized\non the existence of the relevant properties) are necessary truths.\nThis is, in the first instance, only an argument for the necessity of\ncausal laws, but perhaps it can be argued that all laws of\nnature are of this kind. Of course, even if this assumption is\ngranted, the argument is only as strong as the premise that properties\nhave their associated causal powers essentially. To support this view,\nSydney Shoemaker (1980) has given a battery of epistemological\narguments. He points out that our knowledge of the properties that an\nobject possesses can only rest on their effects on us, and must\ntherefore be grounded in the causal powers associated with these\nproperties. But, he goes on to argue that, without a necessary\nconnection between the properties and the associated causal powers, an\nobject\u2019s effects on us could not serve as a source of all the\nknowledge about an object\u2019s properties that we take ourselves to\npossess.\n\nThe argument from counterfactual robustness (Swoyer 1982;\nFales 1990, 1993; also see Lange 2004 for discussion). Natural laws\nare often believed to differ from accidental generalizations by their\ncounterfactual robustness (counterfactual-supporting power).\nSetting aside some minor complications (see Lewis 1979a), we can\ndescribe this feature as follows: if it is a law that all \\(F\\)s\nare \\(G\\), then this generalization would still have been true if\nthere had been more \\(F\\)s than there actually are, or if some \\(F\\)s\nhad found themselves in conditions different from the ones that\nactually obtain. For example, it would still have been true that\nnothing moves faster than light if there had been more objects than\nthere actually are, or if some bodies had been moving in a different\ndirection. Contrast this with No emerald has ever decorated a\nroyal crown. That may be true, but it is not very robust. It\nwould have been false if some rulers of the past had made different\nfashion choices. Some necessitarians have argued that contingentism\nabout the laws cannot provide a plausible explanation of the special\ncounterfactual robustness of the laws. Note that a counterfactual\n\u201cif it had been the case that \\(P\\), then it would have been the\ncase that \\(Q\\)\u201d is usually taken to be true if \\(Q\\) is true in\nthose metaphysically possible \\(P\\)-worlds that are closest to\nactuality. On this view, the special counterfactual robustness of the\nlaw All \\(F\\)s are \\(G\\) amounts, roughly speaking, to this:\nof all the metaphysically possible worlds that contain some additional\n\\(F\\)s, or where some actual \\(F\\)s are in somewhat different\ncircumstances, the ones where the actual law holds are closer than the\nrest. If the laws hold in some metaphysically possible worlds but not\nin others, then the reason why the former are closer than the latter\nmust be that the rules we are using for deciding which worlds count as\nthe closest say so. But which such rules we use is a matter of\nconvention. The counterfactual-supporting power of the laws does not\nseem to be a purely conventional matter, however. Necessitarianism,\nthe argument continues, offers a better explanation: the laws hold in\nthe closest possible worlds simply because they hold in all\nmetaphysically possible worlds. Conventions don\u2019t come into it.\nThe contingentist may reply that, even though the counterfactual\nrobustness of the laws is grounded in a convention, that convention is\nnot arbitrary. Instead, it may have its rationale in\ncertain features of the laws that make them different from accidental\ngeneralizations in an objectively important way (Sidelle 2002),\ne.g., the fact that laws relate to pervasive and conspicuous patterns\nin the history of the world, or the fact that the truth of a law\n(unlike the truth of an accidental generalization) is explanatorily\nindependent of matters of particular fact (Kment 2015b,\n11\u201312).\n\nContingentism has often been defended by pointing out that the laws of\nnature can be known only a posteriori, and that their\nnegations are conceivable (see Sidelle 2002). Necessitarians may reply\nto the first point that Kripke\u2019s work has given us reasons for\nthinking that a posteriori truths can be metaphysically\nnecessary (see\n section 1.1).\n In response to the second point, they may grant that the negation of\na law is conceivable, but deny that conceivability is a good guide to\npossibility (see the entry\n epistemology of modality).\n Alternatively, they may deny that we can really conceive of a\nsituation in which, say, bodies violate the law of gravitation. What\nwe can conceive of is a situation in which objects move in ways that\nappear to violate the law. But that situation cannot be\ncorrectly be described as involving objects with mass.\nRather, the objects in the imagined situation have a different\nproperty that is very similar to mass (call it \u2018schmass\u2019)\nbut which is governed by slightly different laws. Contingentists may\nreply that the non-existence of schmass (or the non-existence of\nobjects that move in the way imagined) is itself a law, so that we\nhave, after all, conceived of a situation where one of the actual laws\nfails (see Fine 2002).\n",
