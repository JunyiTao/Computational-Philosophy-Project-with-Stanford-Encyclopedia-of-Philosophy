    "main_text": "Simplicity, Stable Belief, and Ockham\u2019s Razor || Regressive Mind Changes and Simplicity: Another Ockham Theorem\n5.4 Regressive Mind Changes and Simplicity: Another Ockham Theorem\n\nThe previous subsection defines a complete simplicity ranking for\nevery hypothesis under investigation. This means that any hypothesis\ncan be compared to another as simpler or equally simple. A less\ndemanding concept is a partial order, which allows that some\nhypotheses may simply not be comparable, like apples and oranges.\nGenin and Kelly [2015] show that the following partial order leads to\nan Ockham principle for avoiding regressive mind changes (see\n Section 4.3).\n\nAn observation sequence separates hypothesis \\(H_1\\) from\nhypothesis \\(H_2\\) if the observations are consistent with \\(H_1\\) and\nfalsify \\(H_2\\) (given background knowledge). \nHypothesis \\(H_1\\) is inseparable from \\(H_2\\), written \\(H_1 \\lt\nH_2\\), if no observation sequence separates \\(H_1\\) from\n\\(H_2\\). Equivalently, \\(H_1 \\lt H_2\\) if and only if any evidence\nconsistent with \\(H_1\\) is also consistent with \\(H_2.\\)\n\n\nThe separation terminology is due to Smets et al., who relate it to\nseparation principles in point-set topology. In terms of the\nepistemological interpretation of point-set topology from\n Section 3.2,\n we have \\(H_1 \\lt H_2\\) if and only if every complete data sequence\nfor \\(H_1\\) is a boundary point for the data sequences of \\(H_2.\\) In\nan epistemologically resonant phrase, Genin and Kelly say that\nhypothesis \\(H_1\\) \u201cfaces the problem of induction\u201d with respect to\n\\(H_2\\) whenever \\(H_1 \\lt H_2\\). This is because whenever \\(H_1\\) is\ncorrect, a reliable learner will have to take an \u201cinductive leap\u201d and\nconjecture \\(H_1\\) although any finite amount of evidence is also\nconsistent with \\(H_2\\).\nExamples\n\nIn the raven problem, \\(H_1 =\\) \u201call ravens are black\u201d\n\\(\\lt H_2 =\\) \u201csome raven is not black\u201d. But it\nis not the case that \u201csome raven is not black\u201d\n\\(\\lt\\) \u201call ravens are black\u201d because the observation of a\nwhite raven separates \\(H_2\\) from \\(H_1.\\) \nIn\n causal graph learning,\nif graph \\(G_1\\) contains a subset of edges (direct causal links) of\nthose in alternative graph \\(G_2\\), then \\(G_1 \\lt G_2\\). This is\nbecause any correlations that can be explained by \\(G_1\\) can also be\nexplained by the larger graph \\(G_2\\). \nIn curve fitting, \\(L \\lt Q\\) where \\(L\\) is\nthe set of linear functions, and \\(Q\\) is the set of quadratic\nfunctions. This is because any set of points that can be fit by a\nlinear function can also be fit by a quadratic function.\n\n\nThese examples suggest that the \\(\\lt\\) partial order corresponds to\nour intuitive simplicity judgements about empirical hypotheses; Genin\nand Kelly [2019] provide an extensive defense of this claim. It can be\nshown that the \\(\\lt\\) ordering agrees with the simplicity ranks\ndefined in the previous subsection, in the sense that if \\(H_1 \\lt\nH_2\\) but not \\(H_2 \\lt H_1\\), then the simplicity rank of \\(H_1\\) is\nless than the rank of \\(H_2\\). These observations motivate an Ockham\nprinciple: An inductive method satisfies the Ockham principle with\nrespect to separability if it always conjectures a maximally\nsimple hypothesis \\(H\\) consistent with the evidence. In our notation,\nif an Ockham method adopts a hypothesis \\(H\\) given a finite\nobservation sequence, then there is no alternative simpler hypothesis\n\\(H'\\) such that \\(H' \\lt H\\). That is, every alternative hypothesis\n\\(H'\\) will eventually be separated from \\(H\\) by the evidence if\n\\(H'\\) is true. In the raven example, the generalizing method\nsatisfies the Ockham principle, but the contrary method does not,\nbecause it adopts \\(H_2 =\\) \u201csome raven is not black\u201d. The\nfollowing theorem shows that the connection between the Ockham\nprinciple and regressive mind changes is general. \n\nTheorem. If an inductive method avoids conjecture\ncycles (and hence regressive mind changes), it satisfies the Ockham\nprinciple with respect to separability. \n\nFor a proof see Genin and Kelly [2015; Theorem 10]. Genin and Kelly\nalso provide sufficient conditions for avoiding conjecture cycles.\n\n\nWhile the results in this section establish a fruitful connection\nbetween simplicity and mind-change optimality, a limitation of the\napproach is that it requires that some hypotheses must be conclusively\nentailed or falsified by some evidence sequence. This is typically not\nthe case for statistical models, where the probability of a hypothesis\nmay become arbitrarily small but usually not 0. For instance, consider\na coin flip problem and the hypothesis \u201cthe probability of heads\nis 90%\u201d. If we observe one million tails, the probability of the\nhypothesis is very small indeed, but it is not 0, because any number\nof tails is logically consistent with a high probability of heads. The\nnext section discusses how a reliabilist approach can be adapted to\nstatistical hypotheses.\n",
