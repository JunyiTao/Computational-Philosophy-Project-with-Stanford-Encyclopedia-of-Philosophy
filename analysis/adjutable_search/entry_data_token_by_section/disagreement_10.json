    "main_text": "Disagreement By the Numbers\n6. Disagreement By the Numbers\n\n\nMany disagreements are one-on-one: one person disagrees with another\nperson and as far as they know they are the only two who have any\nopinion on the matter. Lisa thinks that she and Marie should move in\ntogether; then Lisa discovers that Marie has the opposite opinion. Bob\nand his sister Teri disagree about whether their father had an affair\nwhen they were children. In this case they know that others have the\nanswer\u2014their father, for one\u2014but for various reasons the\nopinions of others are not accessible.\n\n\nMany other disagreements involve just a few people. Bob, Rob, Hob, and\nGob work in a small hotel and are wondering whether to ask for raises\nin their hourly pay rate. After discussion Bob thinks they should, Rob\nand Hob think they shouldn\u2019t, and Gob is undecided.  When Bob\nlearns all this about his three colleagues, what should his doxastic\nreaction be to this mixed bag of agreement and disagreement?\n\n\nHowever, when it comes to many of your beliefs, including some of the\nmost interesting ones, you are fully aware that millions of\npeople disagree with you and millions of other people agree\nwith you. Just consider a belief about religion\u2014just about any\nbelief at all, pro or con. You must have some views on\ncontroversial matters; virtually every human does. Moreover,\nyou\u2019re perfectly aware that they are controversial. For the most\npart, it\u2019s not as though you believe \\(B\\), \\(B\\) happens to be\ncontroversial, but you had no idea it was controversial.\n\n\nMoreover, when it comes to these controversial beliefs that large\nnumbers of people have taken positions on, it\u2019s often the case\nthat there are experts on the matter. In many cases the experts have a\ndefinite opinion: global warming is happening and the earth is many\nmillions of years old. Other times they don\u2019t: electrons and\nquarks come from \u201cstrings\u201d.\n\n\nIf the numbers matter, then disagreement poses a skeptical threat for\nnearly every view of the significance of peer disagreement. The\nskeptical threat for conciliatory views (the Equal Weight View, the\nJustificationist View, and the Total Evidence View) is pretty\nstraightforward. On the Equal Weight View, since for many\ncontroversial beliefs we are not justified in believing that the\nweighing of opinions favors our own opinion on the matter, the reasons\nfor thinking that we are mistaken outweigh our reasons for thinking we\nare correct. The added resources of the Justificationist View and the\nTotal Evidence View also do not seem to help in resisting the\nskeptical conclusion.  For many controversial views we lack the strong\nfirst-order evidence and high antecedent justification that these\nviews utilize to mitigate the call to conciliate. Further, while\nappeals to personal information may be good symmetry-breakers in cases\nof one-to-one disagreement, when the numbers of disagreeing parties\nare much larger, the effectiveness of such appeals radically\ndiminishes. Similar considerations apply to most Steadfast Views. Most\ndefenses of Steadfast Views attempt to find a symmetry-breaker in the\npeer-to-peer disagreement that allow for one to privilege one\u2019s\nown belief. For instance, even if self-trust or private evidence can\ngive one a reason to privilege their own belief, such a\nsymmetry-breaker is seemingly not up to the task when the belief in\nquestion is a minority view. Given that most controversial beliefs in\nscience, religion, politics, and philosophy are minority views, it\nappears that even if many Steadfast Views of peer disagreement are\ncorrect, they still face a skeptical challenge regarding disagreement\nmore generally. The notable exception here is the Right Reasons\nView. Since according to the Right Reasons View, what one is justified\nin believing is entirely determined by the first-order evidence, no\namount of discovered disagreement would change which controversial\nbeliefs are rational. While the Right Reasons View, may be safe from\nsuch skeptical concerns, such safety only comes by way of what many\nsee as the feature that makes it implausible. For instance, the Right\nReasons View has it that you can be justified in believing \\(p\\) even\nwhen you are aware that every other peer and superior to you believes\nnot-\\(p\\). While this avoids the more general skeptical threat, many\nsee this as too high a price.\n\n\nAnother issue concerning how the numbers matter regards the\nindependence of the relevant opinions. Our beliefs are shaped by a\nnumber of factors, and not all of them are epistemically\nrelevant. Certain religious beliefs, political beliefs, and even\nphilosophical beliefs are correlated with growing up in particular\nregions or going to certain schools. For this reason, it may be\nthought that the agreement of individuals who came to their opinions\non a matter independently count for more, epistemically speaking, then\nagreement of individuals with a greater shared background. For more on\nthis issue, see Carey & Matheson 2013, Goldman 2001, and Lackey 2013b.\n",
