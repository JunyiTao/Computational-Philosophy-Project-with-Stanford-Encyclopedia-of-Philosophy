    "main_text": "Arguments for Fictionalism || Analogies with uncontroversially non-literal discourse\n3.4 Analogies with uncontroversially non-literal discourse\n\nOne way to argue for fictionalism about a region of discourse is to\nshow that our use of declarative sentences within the discourse\nresembles our use of non-literal language in other areas. There are\nthree considerations that can be brought up under this heading.\n\n(1) Unobtrusive metaphors \u2014 metaphors that easily go unnoticed\n\u2014 are quite common. So we should not be surprised if some\nphilosophically interesting discourse should turn out to be permeated\nby such metaphors. Consider the following list from Yablo (2000a):\n\nThey put a lot of hurdles in your path, there\u2019s a lot that could\nbe said about that, there\u2019s no precedent for that, something\ntells me you\u2019re right, there are some things better left unsaid,\nthere is something I forgot to tell you, viz. how to operate the lock,\nnothing gets my goat as much as chewing gum in class, a lot you can do\nfor me, let\u2019s roll out the red carpet, the last thing I want is\nto\u2026, their people have risen in my esteem, I took her into my\nconfidence, my patience is nearly exhausted, I\u2019ll take my\nchances, there\u2019s a trace of sadness in your eyes, a growing\nnumber of these leaks can be traced to Starr\u2019s office,\nshe\u2019s got a lot of smarts, let\u2019s pull out all the stops,\nlet\u2019s proceed along the lines suggested above.\n\n\nThe idea is that there are many unobtrusive metaphors; and that if\nmetaphors can often be this unobtrusive, then maybe the\nnon-literalness of our actual utterances of sentences of D is\nalso unobtrusive. Of course, what Yablo says here is controversial.\nOne can insist that some of Yablo\u2019s examples are not metaphors\nbut idioms. And one can insist that for some of the examples, the only\nreason to regard them as non-literal would stem from a prior\nconviction that their literal truth would require metaphysical\nabsurdities. But so long as there are a fair number of unobtrusive\nmetaphors, Yablo has a point.\n\n(2) Relatedly, one way that fictionalists try to argue for their\ndoctrines is by appeal to cases where, supposedly, fictionalist theses\nare obviously true. Consider first motion discourse. Some\nfictionalists hold that we happily say things like \u201cthe sun\nrises\u201d despite knowing fully well that this sentence is not\nliterally true in the relevant contexts of utterance. The idea is that\nfor the literal truth of these sentences a Ptolemaic, absolutist\nworldview would have to be correct. But obviously, even though we use\nthese sentences to make assertions, we do not believe this sort of\nworldview to be true. We engage instead in a Ptolemaic and absolutist\nfiction. Next consider expressions of the form \u2018the average\nF\u2019. We routinely utter declarative sentences containing\nsuch expressions in subject position; it seems that for such a\nsentence to be literally true there would really have to be an average\nF. This seems absurd. It seems odd that we should cheerfully\ncommit ourselves to such an absurdity. Hence, it is sometimes\nsuggested, hermeneutic fictionalism is true of the use of these\nexpressions. \n\n(3) Both in his (2000a) and elsewhere, Yablo draws up a list of\nanalogies between on the one hand uncontroversially non-literal\ndiscourse and on the other hand discourse about \u201cplatonic\nobjects\u201d \u2014 for present purposes one can think of these\nsimply as would-be objects ripe for fictionalist\n treatment[2]\n \u2014. I will not here reproduce the whole list. But here are some\nrepresentative suggested analogies: \n\n\n\nParaphrasability: [Creatures of metaphorical make-believe] are often\nparaphrasable away with no felt loss of subject matter. \u2018That\nwas her first encounter with the green-eyed monster\u2019 goes to\n\u2018that was her first time feeling jealous\u2019. \u2018That\nreally gets my goat\u2019 goes to \u2018that really irritates\nme\u2019.\n\n[Platonic objects] are often paraphrasable away with no felt loss of\nsubject matter. \u2018There is a possible world with furry\ndonkeys\u2019 goes to \u2018furry donkeys are possible\u2019.\n\u2018She did it one way or another\u2019 goes to \u2018she did it\nsomehow\u2019. Etc.\n\n\nSilliness: [Creatures of metaphorical make-believe] invite\n\u2018silly questions\u2019 probing areas the make-believe does not\naddress, e.g. we know how big the average star is, but where is it\nlocated? You say you lost your nerve, has it been turned in? Do you\nplan to drop-forge the uncreated conscience of your race in\nthe smithy of your soul?\n\n[Platonic objects] invite questions which are similarly silly. What\nare the intrinsic properties of the empty set? Is the event of the\nwater\u2019s boiling itself hot? Are universals wholly present in\neach of their instances? Do relations lead a divided existence,\nparcelled out among their relata? \n\n\nIt is obviously debatable exactly how telling these analogies are. One\nmay for example reasonably suspect that the claim that the supposedly\nsilly questions about platonic objects really all are silly will have\nappeal only for philosophers of a certain bent of mind.\n",
