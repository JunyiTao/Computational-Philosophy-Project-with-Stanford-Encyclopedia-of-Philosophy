    "main_text": "Branching time temporal logics || Prior\u2019s theory of branching time\n5.1 Prior\u2019s theory of branching time\n\nThe picture that is at the core of Prior\u2019s theory of branching\ntime is reminiscent of the one evoked by Borges\u2019 The Garden\nof Forking Paths. The interrelation of time and modality is\nrepresented as a tree of alternative histories that is linear towards\nthe past and branches into multiple possible futures.\nBackward-linearity captures the idea that the past is fixed;\nforward-branching reflects the openness of the future. At each point\nin time, there may be more than one path leading towards the future,\nand each such path represents a future possibility.\n\nFormally, a tree (or branching time structure) is a\ntemporal frame \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\left\\langle T, \\prec \\right\\rangle\\)\nwhere the temporal precedence relation \\(\\prec\\) is a backward-linear\npartial ordering on the set of time instants \\(T\\) which is such that\nany two instants have a common \\(\\prec\\)-predecessor in \\(T\\). That\nis, every time instant in a tree has a linearly ordered set of\n\\(\\prec\\)-predecessors, and any two instants share some common past. The\nformer condition rules out backward-branching, while the latter\nensures \u2018historical connectedness\u2019. In the philosophical\nliterature, the temporal precedence relation \\(\\prec\\) is commonly\nassumed to be irreflexive, i.e. a strict partial order, whereas in\ncomputer science, usually reflexive structures are studied.\n\nA tree \\(\\mathcal{T} = \\left\\langle T, \\prec \\right\\rangle\\) depicts\nalternative, mutually incompatible possibilities for the future in a\nunified structure, and it can be carved up into multiple histories. A\nhistory in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is a maximal (i.e. non-extendable)\nset of time instants that is linearly ordered by \\(\\prec\\), that is,\nan entire path through the tree; and it represents a complete possible\ncourse of events. We denote the set of all histories in\n\\(\\mathcal{T}\\) by \\(\\mathcal{H}(\\mathcal{T})\\), and we use\n\\(\\mathcal{H}(t)\\) for the set of histories passing through a given\ntime instant \\(t\\) in \\(\\mathcal{T}\\). \n\nSome philosophers have criticized the label \u2018branching\ntime\u2019 as a misnomer, arguing that time does not branch but\nrather evolves linearly. Early criticism along these lines is found in\nRescher and Urquhart (1971), and a similar point is raised in Belnap\net al. (2001), who suggest the label \u2018branching histories\u2019\ninstead. This criticism also casts doubt on the appropriateness of the\nterminology \u2018time instants\u2019 used here to refer to the\nprimitive points of the tree. We stick to the terminology for reasons\nof uniformity. In the branching time literature, the more neutral\nexpression \u2018moments\u2019 is prevailing, and in Belnap et al.\n(2001) the distinction between instants of time and moments is\nformally worked out: branching time structures are associated with a\nlinearly ordered set of time instants, where an instant is defined as\nthe set of contemporaneous moments contained in different\nhistories.\n",
