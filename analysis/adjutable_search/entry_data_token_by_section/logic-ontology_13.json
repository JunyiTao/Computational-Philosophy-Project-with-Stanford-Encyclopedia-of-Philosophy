Conclusion\n\nWith the many conceptions of logic and the many different\nphilosophical projects under the heading of ontology, there are many\nproblems that are in the intersection of these areas. We have touched\non several above, but there are also others. Although there is no\nsingle problem about the relationship between logic and ontology,\nthere are many interesting connections between them, some closely\nconnected to central philosophical questions. The references and links\nbelow are intended to provide a more in depth discussions of these\ntopics.\n",
