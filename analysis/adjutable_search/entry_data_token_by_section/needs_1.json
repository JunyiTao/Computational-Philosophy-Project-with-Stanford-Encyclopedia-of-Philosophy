    "main_text": "The normativity of need || Are Need Claims always Elliptical?\n1.1 Are Need Claims always Elliptical?\n\n\nA good place to start is with the question whether claims of the form\n\u2018\\(A\\) needs \\(X\\)\u2019 are always elliptical, that is whether\nthey are always opaque unless filled out by supplying the end, \\(Y\\),\nfor which \\(X\\) is needed. Clearly many need statements have that\nproperty. If I say \u2018Mary needs a hat\u2019, then unless the\ncontext makes it clear already, it is apposite to ask \u2018What does\nshe need the hat for?\u2019 to which the answer might be \u2018To\navoid getting sunburnt\u2019. Yet other need claims seem not to be\nelliptical in that way. If I say \u2018the baby needs its diaper\nchanged\u2019, it would be more than a little bizarre to ask\n\u2018what for?\u2019. Although it would no doubt be possible\nformally to expand the sentence by specifying a goal, no fresh\ninformation would be supplied to anyone who already knew what a baby\nwas and what a diaper was, whereas in the case of Mary\u2019s hat,\nthe reference to sunburn does genuine explanatory work by displacing\nother reasons that Mary might have for needing suitable headgear.\n\n\nIt matters whether or not all need statements are elliptical because\nthis is connected to the further question whether need claims can have\nindependent justificatory force. For those who deny this, such as\nBarry, the fact that need claims always require spelling out in the\nform \u2018\\(A\\) needs \\(X\\) in order to \\(Y\\)\u2019 shows that what\nmatters normatively are always the \\(Y\\) items, the ends for which the\nthings needed are necessary. Barry concedes that there are\n\u2018core\u2019 cases of human need where the context makes it\nclear that the ends being invoked fall within a narrow range (health,\nfor instance), yet concludes that \u2018this modification does not\naffect my thesis that no special account has to be taken of\n\u201cneed\u201d, for it is still derivative and the only\ninteresting questions arise in connection with the ends\u2019 (Barry\n1965, 49).\n\n\nOthers, however, deny this. For Wiggins, the problem with the claim\nthat all need claims are elliptical is that it blurs the distinction\nbetween the instrumental sense of \u2018need\u2019, where the\npurpose for which the claimed item is needed might be almost anything,\nand the categorical sense where \u2018the purpose is already fixed,\nand fixed by virtue of the meaning of the word\u2019 (Wiggins 1998,\n9). In the case of categorical needs, needed items are things that\nhuman beings must have to avoid being harmed, but it is a mistake to\nsee \u2018avoidance of harm\u2019 as a further end that explains why\nthe need is a need; instead it is already present in the idea of need\nitself. A similar argument is made by Thomson (1987), though using a\ndifferent vocabulary of derivative and basic needs. Of course these\nanalyses of the concept of need do not yet tell us what our\ncategorical or basic needs are. It is uncontroversial to say that the\nresources without which a human being could not survive, such as food\nand water, count as needs. But how far beyond this does the concept\nstretch? Could needs that only some people have count as categorical,\nfor example? We return to this question in section 3 below when we\ndiscuss different substantive theories of need.\n",
