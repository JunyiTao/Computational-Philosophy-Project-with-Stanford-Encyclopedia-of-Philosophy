    "main_text": "The nature of Sextus\u2019 Pyrrhonism (PH I) || Modes\n3.5 Modes\n\n\nBy far the longest single discussion in PH I concerns the\nmodes of Skepticism (I 31\u2013186) (see Annas and Barnes 1985; Barnes\n1990a,b; Striker 1993; Hankinson 1995: chapters 9 and 10; Perin\n2006: 354\u20138; Woodruff 2010; Morison 2011, 2018; Bullock 2016). These are announced as\nbeing means by which the Skeptic comes to suspension of judgment (I\n35). Recall that the Skeptic achieves his characteristic state of\nsuspension of judgment (epoch\u00ea), with respect to some\nproposition or other, by assembling arguments or considerations on both\nsides (PH I 12). The Skeptic needs techniques or tools to\nbring this suspension about. The modes divide into four groups, the Ten\nModes, the Five Modes, the Two Modes, and the Eight Modes. (Presumably\nthe Skeptic can employ methods other than the modes for bringing about\nsuspension of judgment. For extended analysis of one such method, that\nof \u2018reversal\u2019, see Castagnoli 2010: ch. 14.)\n3.5.1  The Ten Modes (PH I 35\u2013163)\n\n\nThis charming group of modes, attributed by Sextus in PH I\n36 to unnamed \u2018older skeptics\u2019, but in M VII 345\nto Aenesidemus (fl. first century BCE; see Schofield 2007; Hankinson\n2010), gets the longest treatment of all the groups of modes:\n\nThe mode depending on the variations\namong animals (I 40\u201378);\nThe mode depending on the differences\namong humans (I 79\u201390);\nThe mode depending on the differing\nconstitutions of the sense-organs (I 91\u201399);\nThe mode depending on circumstance (I\n100\u2013117);\nThe mode depending on positions and\nintervals and places (I 118\u201323);\nThe mode depending on admixtures (I\n124\u201328);\nThe mode depending on the quantities and\npreparations of existing things (I 129\u201334);\nThe mode deriving from relativity (I\n135\u201340);\nThe mode depending on frequent or rare\nencounters (I 141\u201344);\nThe mode depending on persuasions and customs and laws and\nbelief in myths and dogmatic suppositions (I 145\u201362).\n\n\n\nThe point of the Ten Modes is to provide us with propositions to use\nagainst dogmatists who make their usual rash claims about the way the\nworld is. They exploit the relativity at the heart of appearances to\nundermine these claims. There is a pattern underlying them, since they\neach supply us with two propositions: x (a thing) appears\nF in (situation) S, and x appears\nF* (i.e., something incompatible with F) in another\nsituation S* (Annas and Barnes 1985: 24). Here are some\nrepresentative examples: \n\n\nperfume appears very pleasant to humans but intolerable to\ndung-beetles and bees (first mode, PH I 55);\n the same honey appears sweet to me, but bitter to people with\njaundice (fourth mode, PH I 101);\nthe same tower appears from a distance round, but from close at\nhand square (fifth mode, PH I 118);\n the poets represent the gods as committing adultery and indulging in homosexual\nacts, while with us the law forbids these things (tenth mode, PH I 159).\n\n\n\nWhat does the Skeptic do with the pair of propositions\ngenerated by an application of the Ten Modes? Annas and Barnes suggest\nthe Skeptic propounds to himself instances of the following schema\n(1985: 25):\n\nThere are oppositions:\n\n (1)\n\nx appears F in S\n (2)\nx appears F* in S*\n\nbut the appearances are equipollent, i.e.,\n\n(3)\n we cannot\nprefer S to S* or vice versa;\n\nHence we arrive at suspension of judgment, i.e.,\n\n(4)\n we can\nneither affirm nor deny that x is really F or really\nF*.\n\n\n\n\n(For similar stories, see Hankinson 1995: 156; Striker 1993: 120.)\nThis is an unattractive interpretation as it stands. The Skeptic surely\ncannot endorse premiss (3); this is a dogma of the forbidden\nkind. Also, the Skeptic\u2019s suspension of judgment is not a\nconclusion to any argument (in the logical sense of the term),\nbut something that happens to us when we are confronted by equal and\nopposing arguments (see e.g., Barnes 1982: 59). So an alternative\ninterpretation would be to suppose that the Ten Modes are devices for\ngenerating precisely such equal and opposing arguments, and\nnot merely a pair of propositions (Morison 2011: 287\u201393). What would\nthe two opposing arguments be? Schematically, they would be as\nfollows:\n\n\n\nx appears F in S \nx appears F* in S*\n\n\nTherefore, x is F Therefore, x is\n  F*\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of the application of the fourth mode that we saw above,\nit would generate these two arguments:\n\n(1) Honey is perceived to be\nsweet by healthy people\nTherefore, honey is sweet\n(2) Honey is perceived to be\nbitter by jaundiced people\nTherefore, honey is bitter\n\n\n\nArguments (1) and (2) are opposing arguments because their\nconclusions conflict, and they are equal because (2) matches\n(1) in argumentative strategy: \n\nThe second argument makes exactly\nthe same move as the first: where the first called upon a fact\nconcerning how honey is perceived, so did the second. (Morison\n2011: 292)\n\nSuspension of judgment will follow for the Skeptic, since\nhe is confronted by two equal and opposing arguments (and because the\narguments are equal, he doesn\u2019t need to say to himself any\npremiss such as premiss (3) of Annas and Barnes\u2019 argument given\nabove). Thus, the Ten Modes are devices for generating an equal and\nopposing argument in response to a dogmatist\u2019s attempt to show\nhow things are based on how they are perceived in some situation or\nother.\n3.5.2 The Five Modes (PH I 164\u201377)\n\n\nSextus\u2019 presentation of the Five Modes is brief and\nelliptical, which is much to be regretted, since philosophically they\nare the most interesting of all the modes. They are attributed here to\n\u2018the more recent Skeptics\u2019, but Diogenes La\u00ebrtius\ntells us that the modes were invented by Agrippa (DL IX 88), who\nprobably lived at the end of the first century BCE. Here is the\ncomplete text of Sextus\u2019 presentation (PH I 164\u20139):\n\n\n\n[164] The more recent Skeptics offer the following five modes of\nsuspension of judgment: first, the mode deriving from dispute; second,\nthe mode throwing one back ad infinitum; third, the mode\nderiving from relativity; fourth, the hypothetical mode; fifth, the\nreciprocal mode. [165] According to the mode deriving from dispute, we\nfind that undecidable dissension about the matter proposed has come\nabout both in ordinary life and among philosophers. Because of\nthis we are not able either to choose or to rule out anything, and we\nend up with suspension of judgment. [166] In the mode deriving from\ninfinite regress, we say that what is brought forward as a source of\nconviction for the matter proposed itself needs another such source,\nwhich itself needs another, and so ad infinitum, so that we\nhave no point from which to begin to establish anything, and suspension\nof judgment follows. [167] In the mode deriving from relativity as we\nsaid above, the existing object appears to be such-and-such relative to\nthe subject judging and to the things observed together with it, but we\nsuspend judgment on what it is like in its nature. [168] We have the\nmode from hypothesis when the Dogmatists, being thrown back ad\ninfinitum, begin from something which they do not establish but\nclaim to assume simply and without proof in virtue of a concession.\n[169] The reciprocal mode occurs when what ought to be confirmatory of\nthe object under investigation needs to be made convincing by the\nobject under investigation; then, being unable to take either in order\nto establish the other, we suspend judgment about both.\n\n\n\nThe reference in the discussion of the Mode of Relativity (\u0399 167)\nis a reference back to PH I 39 where Sextus tells us that all\nTen Modes of Aenesidemus can be put under the generic heading of\n\u2018relativity\u2019 (not to be confused with the eighth of the\nTen Modes, also known as the Mode of Relativity\u2014although it\nseems as though Sextus himself made precisely that confusion; Annas\nand Barnes 1985: 142\u20133; for more on this difficult mode, see\nBrennan and Lee 2014). So one of the Five Modes is an umbrella mode\nfor all of the Ten Modes, which, as we have seen, were best thought of\nas devices for generating equal and opposing arguments to arguments\nput forward by dogmatists which depend upon how things are perceived\nin this or that situation.\n\n\nThe Mode of Dispute is also a device for generating equal and\nopposing arguments, this time arguments which appeal to the authority\nof either ordinary life or some philosopher. For an example of this\nmode in operation, look at PH II 18: \n \nOf those who have\ndiscussed standards, some have asserted that there is one (e.g., the\nStoics and certain others), some that there is not (among them,\nXeniades of Corinth and Xenophanes of Colophon who says: \u2018but\nbelief is found over all\u2019); and we suspend judgment as to whether\nthere is one or not.\n \n Sextus imagines someone arguing for the\nphilosophical position that there is a \u2018standard\u2019 (more on\nthat below) on the basis of the fact that the Stoics say there is one;\nthe Skeptic would counter that one could equally well argue that there\nis no standard, since Xeniades and Xenophanes say there\nisn\u2019t one. The mode of dispute codifies a tactic in the\nSkeptic\u2019s ongoing fight with dogmatists: it is a weapon to be\ndeployed when the dogmatist employs an argument from authority. (For a\ndifferent view on what the mode of dispute is, see Barnes 1990a: ch.\n1.)\n\n\nIt is the three remaining modes which are the most interesting. To see\nhow they work, consider the following fact. When the dogmatist\nproduces an argument for a claim, P, either he produces (or\ngestures at) an argument which goes on forever\u2014an infinite\nregress\u2014or not. To produce an infinite regress would mean that\nin offering grounds for his claim P, he gives grounds,\nQ, and then for that he offers grounds, R, and so on,\nwithout ever repeating himself.  If he doesn\u2019t produce an\ninfinite regress, he produces an argument which stops somewhere. In\nother words, in offering grounds for his claim P, he gives\ngrounds, Q, and then for that he offers grounds, R,\netc. and this chain of grounds terminates somewhere. Now there are two\npossibilities, either this chain terminates in the same claim with\nwhich it started (P), or it doesn\u2019t. The first of those two\ncases is a case of a circular argument\u2014an argument for the\nconclusion P which eventually appeals to P as its own\nground. The second case is a case of an argument which starts from\nunsupported propositions (first principles, or axioms, perhaps), which\nfunction as the \u2018anchor\u2019 for the proposition P we\nare trying to prove.  Thus, there are exactly three possibilities for\nthe form an argument propounded by a dogmatist might take: an infinite\nregress, a reciprocal or circular argument, or one which terminates in\na hypothesis.\n\n\nThe usual interpretation of the modes of infinite regress,\nreciprocality, and hypothesis, is that they codify Sextus\u2019\ncondemnation of each of these three forms of argument. So, in\nby far the best and fullest treatment of the Five Modes to date, Barnes\n1990a, we are told that Sextus thinks that infinitely regressive\narguments are \u2018bad arguments\u2019 (1990a: 43). To be\nsure, \u2018Sextus usually leaves unspoken the thought that infinite\nregressions are Bad Things\u2019 (44), but, says Barnes (ibid), Sextus\ndoes offer us one reason for why they are bad: \u2018we have no point\nfrom which to begin to establish anything\u2019 (PH I 166).\nThe interesting philosophical question here is this: why should\nrecognition of a bad argument for the conclusion that P encourage us to\nsuspend judgment on whether P? If I argue that the world will\nend tomorrow on the grounds that Nostradamus says so, your recognition\nthat this is a terrible argument for its conclusion hardly makes you\nsuspend judgment on the question of whether the world will end\ntomorrow! Barnes\u2019 answer is this: \n\nIf the only consideration offered in support\nof a given claim leads to an unacceptable epistemological regression,\nthen we must suspend judgment on the claim. (1990a: 42; Barnes\u2019\nemphasis)\n \nBarnes points out that Sextus often lays out an argument and then says\nthat the skeptic will suspend judgment as far as that argument\ngoes (\u1f45\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\n\u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u1ff3); the idea\nis that Sextus uses that formula to capture the fact that if\nsuch-and-such an argument is all you had to go on, you suspend\njudgment. (See Frede 1979: 10\u201311; 1984: 133; and Brunschwig 1990\nfor more on this phrase.)\n\n\nThus Barnes thinks that the mode of Infinite Regress generates\nsuspension of judgment in the face of an infinitely regressive argument\nby dint of the Skeptic\u2019s condemnation of that type of argument as\ndefective. Barnes extends this analysis to the cases of reciprocality\nand hypothesis too, claiming that Sextus rejects reciprocal arguments\nas \u2018bad arguments\u2019 (1990a: 65; his emphasis) and\nhypothetical arguments as \u2018valueless\u2019 (99). On this\ninterpretation, then, \n \nreciprocal arguments are bad arguments;\nand if the only reason we have for accepting or rejecting P is a bad\nargument, then we should neither accept nor reject P but suspend\njudgement; (65\u20136)\n\nIf the only thing that can be said for\nor against P is that some Dogmatist has hypothesized it, and if\nhypothesizing that P does not establish or warrant belief in P, then we\nshould suspend judgement over P. (99)\n\n\nBarnes\u2019 interpretation of what these three modes accomplish is\nunsatisfactory for a couple of reasons. First, it seems very unlikely that\nSextus would allow himself to condemn these three types of\nargumentation as bad or valueless: isn\u2019t this just the type of\ndogma that everyone agrees the Skeptic can\u2019t have?\nSecond, condemning this or that argument that a Dogmatist gives for a\nconclusion P, and suspending judgment accordingly on whether P, seems\nto fall foul of the strictures that Barnes himself places on what\nSextan suspension of judgment consists in: after all, Sextus supposedly\n\n assembles arguments in favour of an affirmative\nanswer, and arguments in favour of a negative answer. The two sets of\narguments exactly balance one another.\n \u1f18\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae [suspension of\njudgment] supervenes\u2014\u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae directed towards\nthe proposition that P. (Barnes 1982: 59)\n \n Condemning a dogmatist\u2019s\nargument for P does not involve taking into account any\nconsiderations for not-P. (Put it another way, Sextus seems to think\nthat Pyrrhonists suspend judgment in the face of an argument for P and\nan opposing argument for not-P\u2014not when they face an\nargument for P and considerations which undercut that\nargument\u2014for this distinction in epistemology, see\nentries on Defeasible Reasoning\nand Evidence.) Third, Sextus never\ncomes out and says that reciprocal and hypothetical arguments are\nactually bad arguments. In fact, strictly speaking, he doesn\u2019t\neven say that infinitely regressive arguments are bad; he merely says\nthat in such an argument, \u2018we have no point from which to begin\nto establish anything\u2019 (PH I 166), which could be taken\nas a straightforward description of what an infinitely\nregressive argument is, rather than philosophical condemnation\nof it.\n\n\nThere are several responses possible to these objections. One could\nclaim that Sextus is simply confused; his employment of the Five Modes\nis incompatible with his brand of Pyrrhonian Skepticism (no doubt\nbecause they derived from Agrippa and weren\u2019t original to\nSextus). Or, in response to the first objection, one could deny that\nSextus is condemning these types of argument in propria\npersona, and that he instead is taking the criticisms levelled by\ncertain dogmatists against these three types of arguments and using\nthem against those dogmatists who persist in propounding arguments in\nthose forms: Sextus\u2019 Five Modes are \n\na way of showing his\ndogmatic opponents that they ought to suspend judgment, given\ntheir epistemological standards. (Striker 2004: 16)\n\nAnother\noption would be to take the second objection seriously, and seek an\ninterpretation according to which these three modes function like the\nother two members of the Five (and like the Ten Modes) as devices for\ngenerating equal and opposing arguments (an approach suggested by\nMorison 2011: 293\u20134, and worked out in detail in Morison 2018). This latter approach seems promising in the light\nof those texts where Sextus explicitly envisages the Skeptic responding\nto the Dogmatists\u2019 use of hypotheses by coming up with opposing\nhypotheses which would in turn generate opposing conclusions\n(PH I 173; M VIII 370; M III 8; M\nVII 315; etc.; see Barnes 1990a: 100\u2013109).\n\n\nSextus himself thought that the Five Modes had universal\napplication: \u2018That every object of investigation can be referred\nto these modes we shall briefly show as follows\u2019 (PH I\n169). Unfortunately, what follows (PH I 170\u201377) is far from\nclear, and doesn\u2019t take the form one expects, namely the\nobservation that any argument whatsoever must have one of the three\nforms of hypothesis, reciprocality, or infinite regression. That\nstretch of text remains mysterious.\n3.5.3 The Two Modes (PH I 178\u20139)\n\n\nThe Two Modes probably also come from Agrippa (Barnes 1990b: 213),\nand represent an attempt \u2018to have a neat sceptical system\ncompounded out of three of the Five [Modes]: dispute, reciprocity and\nregression\u2019 (Barnes 1990b: 215). But Barnes finds the omission of\nthe Mode of Hypothesis philosophically troubling, given that it\n\u2018is a mode of the first importance to the Pyrrhonists\u2019\n(1990a: 119), and most discussions of the Five Modes mention the system\nof the Two Modes only in passing, especially since Sextus never employs\nthem explicitly during his discussions of dogmatic philosophical\npositions.\n3.5.4 The Eight Modes (PH I 180\u201386)\n\n\nFor these, see Hankinson 1995: 213\u201317.\n\nThey are modes in accordance\nwith which we bring the Dogmatists to a halt by raising puzzles about\ntheir particular causal explanations\u2014we do this because they\npride themselves on these especially. (PH I 180)\n\nThese\nmodes suggest lines of attack that the Skeptic could adopt in response\nto those arguments of the Dogmatists which attempt to discern causes.\nFor instance, \n\naccording to the second [mode], some people often\ngive an explanation in only one way, although there is a rich abundance\nenabling them to explain the object of investigation in a variety of\nways. (PH I 181)\n\n The idea here is that the Skeptic can\napply pressure to the Dogmatist\u2019s attempted explanation by\npointing out that there is an equally good alternative explanation.\nSextus himself suggests that the Eight Modes are superseded by the Five\nModes (PH I 185), and like the Two Modes, Sextus does not\nemploy them explicitly during the course of his writings.\n3.6 The Skeptical Phrases (PH I 187\u2013209)\n\n\nAs a Skeptic, what do you say when suspension of judgment comes upon\nyou in the face of all the arguments and counterarguments you frame in\nthe course of your investigations? Sextus offers the following\noptions:\n\n\u2018No more\u2019 (PH I 188\u201391), which is an\nexpression intended to capture the Skeptic\u2019s state of mind when\n\u2018I do not know which of these things I should assent to and which\nnot assent to\u2019 (191) (for extended discussion, see Castagnoli\n2010: 256\u201377);\n\u2018Perhaps\u2019, \u2018Maybe\u2019, and\n\u2018Possibly\u2019 (194\u20135), short for \u2018perhaps it is and\nperhaps it isn\u2019t\u2019 (194);\n\u2018I suspend judgment\u2019 (196), capturing the\nSkeptic\u2019s state of mind when \u2018I cannot say which of the\nthings proposed I should find convincing and which I should not find\nconvincing\u2019 (ibid);\n\u2018I determine nothing\u2019 (197), capturing the fact that\n\u2018I now feel in such a way as neither to posit dogmatically nor to\nreject any of the things falling under this investigation\u2019\n(ibid);\n\u2018Everything is undetermined\u2019 (198\u20139), short for\n\u2018Those of the matter investigated by the Dogmatists which I have\nconsidered appear such to me that none of them seems to me to exceed in\nconvincingness or lack of convincingness what conflicts with it\u2019\n(199);\n\u2018Everything is inapprehensible\u2019 (200), short for\n\u2018I suppose that up to now I have not apprehended any of these\nthings because of the equipollence of their opposites\u2019\n(ibid);\n\u2018I have no apprehension\u2019 and \u2018I do not\napprehend\u2019 (201);\n\u2018Opposed to every account there is an equal account\u2019\n(202\u20135), short for \u2018To every account I have scrutinized which\npurports to establish something in dogmatic fashion, there appears to\nme to be opposed another account, purporting to establish something in\ndogmatic fashion, equal to it in convincingness or lack of\nconvincingness\u2019 (203).\n\n\n\nSextus makes clear that in uttering these phrases, the Skeptic is\nengaging in a particular form of \u2018non-assertion\u2019\n(PH I 192\u20133; see Stough 1984). The phrases all represent how\nthings appear to the Skeptic, so, for instance, Sextus insists that\nwhen the Skeptic says \u2018I suspend judgment\u2019, he reports only\nhow the arguments appear to him: \u2018we say what appears to us about\nthem, when they make an impression on us\u2019 (196). This might\nappear to settle the question of the beliefs of the Skeptic, since it\ndoes seem as though the Skeptic, in saying what appears to him, states\nthe content of these appearances, and not just that things\nappear thus-and-so (see above, 3.4). However, Sextus also tells us\nthat the Skeptic \u2018takes \u2018is\u2019 in the sense of\n\u2018appears to me\u2019\u2019 (I 198; cf. I 135), so the question\nis not so easily settled after all. One thing is worth noting: if Frede\nis right about the beliefs of the Skeptic, then one of the beliefs of\nthe Skeptic is that \u2018Everything is inapprehensible\u2019 (I\n200). If this is the kind of belief that the Skeptic can have, then it\ncan\u2019t be a belief held as a matter of assembling reasons on\neither side, but must instead be a belief that he has on the basis of\nhis multiple experiences of coming to suspension of judgment,\nrather than on the basis of having a philosophical argument to that\neffect (Frede 1984: 138\u20139). This opens up the possibility that the\nSkeptic can in fact have the belief that Myles Burnyeat says is\nnecessary for the Skeptic to attain tranquillity\n (see above, 3.3).\n3.7 Difference between Pyrrhonism and other schools (PH I 210\u201341)\n\n\nSextus differentiates Pyrrhonian Skepticism from the philosophy of\nHeraclitus (210\u201312), Democritus (213\u201314), the Cyrenaics (215) (see\nespecially Fine 2000, 2003), and Protagoras (216\u201319), from Academic\nSkepticism (220\u201335) (see Striker 1981, 2010; Ioppolo 2009), and Medical\nEmpiricism (see Allen 2010). As stated above, this last section is\nparticularly puzzling, since Sextus, who was part of the Empiricist\nSchool of Medicine (hence his name), seems rather to align Pyrrhonian\nSkepticism with the Methodist School of Medicine, since the form of\nEmpiricism associated with the Empirical school \u2018makes\naffirmations about the inapprehensibility of unclear matters\u2019\n(PH I 236)\u2014presumably the sorts of theory-laden\naffirmations which the Skeptic would not allow himself\n (see 3.6 above)\u2014whereas the Methodists adhere more to the fourfold observances\nof everyday life that Sextus discussed in I 21\u20134\n (see 3.4 above). To\nmitigate the tension, Allen suggests that \u2018Sextus\u2019 remarks\ncan be read as criticizing a certain tendency in Empiricism rather than\nan unqualified repudiation of the school\u2019 (2010: 246), stressing\nthat Sextus\u2019 endorsement of Methodism is not as wholehearted as\nit might seem: \n\n \nthe medical persuasion of the Methodics has some\naffinity with Scepticism\u2014not absolutely but more so than the\nother medical schools and in comparison with them. (PH I 241)\n\n4. PH II and III; M VII\u2013XI\n\nPH I is like a manifesto: it tells you what Pyrrhonism is\nand why it is preferable to other philosophical persuasions. By\ncontrast, PH II and III show Sextus putting into practice the\nskeptical skill: they are stuffed full of dogmatic arguments\naccompanied by skeptical counterarguments (and sometimes just skeptical\ncounterarguments on their own\u2014see below).\n\n\nThe contents of PH II and III closely shadow those of\nM VII\u2013XI. For a table comparing M VII and VIII with\nPH II (and relevant passages in M I\u2013VI), see Bett\n2005: 193\u20135; for a similar table comparing M IX and X to\nPH III (and relevant passages in M I\u2013VI), see Bett\n2012: 161\u201364; for discussion of the comparisons between M XI\nto PH III (and relevant passages in M I\u2013VI), see Bett\n1997. To get an idea of the scope of PH II and III, and\nthereby the corresponding parts of M, here is the list of\ncontents of PH II and III (based on Annas and Barnes 2000: 66\nand 142):\n\nPH II 1\u201312: Can Skeptics investigate what the Dogmatists\ntalk about?\nPH II 13: Where should the investigation of Dogmatism\nbegin?\nPH II 14\u201317: Standards (or criteria)\nPH II 18\u201321: Is there a standard of truth?\nPH II 22\u201347: That by which\nPH II 48\u201369: That through which\nPH II 70\u201379: That in virtue of which\nPH II 80\u201384: Truths and Truth\nPH II 85\u201396: Is anything true by nature?\nPH II 97\u2013103: Signs\nPH II 104\u2013133: Are there any indicative signs?\nPH II 134\u2013143: Proof\nPH II 144\u2013192: Are there any proofs?\nPH II 193\u2013203: Deductions\nPH II 204: Induction\nPH II 205\u201312: Definitions\nPH II 213: Division\nPH II 214: The division of a word into significations\nPH II 215\u201318: Whole and part\nPH II 219\u201327: Genera and species\n\nPH II 228: Common attributes\nPH II 229\u201359: Sophisms\nPH III 1: The part concerned with physics; Active\nprinciples\nPH III 2\u201312: God\nPH III 13\u201316: Causes\nPH III 17\u201329: Is anything a cause of anything?\nPH III 30\u201337: Material Principles\nPH III 38\u201355: Are bodies apprehensible?\nPH III 56\u201362: Blending\nPH III 63: Motion\nPH III 64\u201381: Local motion\nPH III 82\u20134: Increase and decrease\nPH III 85\u201396: Subtraction and addition\nPH III 97: Transposition\nPH III 98\u2013101: Whole and part\nPH III 102\u2013108: Natural change\nPH III 109\u2013114: Generation and destruction\nPH III 115\u201318: Rest\nPH III 119\u201335: Place\nPH III 136\u201350: Time\nPH III 151\u201367: Number\nPH III 168: The ethical part of philosophy\nPH III 169\u201378: Good, bad and indifferent things\nPH III 179\u2013238: Is anything by nature good, bad or\nindifferent?\nPH III 239\u2013249: Is there an expertise in living?\nPH III 250\u201351: Is expertise in living found among\npeople?\nPH III 252: Can expertise in living be taught?\nPH III 253\u201358: Is anything taught?\nPH III 259\u201365: Are there any teachers and learners?\nPH III 265\u201373: Is there a way of learning?\nPH III 273\u20139: Does expertise in living benefit its\npossessor?\nPH III 280\u201381: Why do Skeptics sometimes deliberately\npropound arguments of feeble plausibility?\n\n\n\nNotice the division of the discussions into the traditional Stoic\ndivision of philosophy (Ierodiakonou 1993) into Logic (PH II),\nPhysics (PH III 1\u2013167), and Ethics (PH III\n168\u2013279).\n4.1 The criterion of truth\n\n\nThe most important part of PH II is the long discussion\nof the \u2018criterion\u2019 (or \u2018standard\u2019, as Annas and\nBarnes translate it) of truth (see especially Striker 1974: 1990b;\nBrunschwig 1988). Not only is it philosophically extremely rich,\nbut it plays a crucial role in the dialectic of the contemporary scholarly debate as to\nwhether the Pyrrhonian skeptic can have beliefs. The notion of a\ncriterion of truth was central to the epistemologies of both the Stoics\nand Epicureans:\n \nThe problem of the criterion of truth\u2026 is\nthe problem of how we discover or ascertain the truth\u2014the truth\nthat we need to find in order to attain knowledge. (Striker\n1990b: 151)\n \n The Epicureans and the Stoics had slightly different\ncandidates for what the criteria of truth would be.\n \nEpicurus\u2019 criteria were taken to be primitive truths, that\nis, ones that had to be accepted without proof or further\nargument; (Striker 1990b: 152)\n \nthese are the truths delivered by\nsense-impressions, preconceptions, and feelings (DL X 31), which would\nthen be used to work out the truth of non-primitive propositions. The\nStoics thought that the criteria of truth were special kinds of\nimpressions, so-called \u2018cognitive impressions\u2019, which were\nof such a nature so as to guarantee their own truth (roughly speaking,\nthey \u2018come about from what is\u2019 (DL VII 46) and are clear\nand distinct (see Frede 1983: 164)); they could also be used to work\nout the truth of other, unclear, matters. These two conceptions of the\ncriterion, the Epicurean and the Stoic, were christened the\n\u2018adelic\u2019 and \u2018prodelic\u2019 conceptions by\nBrunschwig (1988: 230\u2013233). (The terms \u2018adelic\u2019 and\n\u2018prodelic\u2019 derive from the Greek words\nad\u00ealon and prod\u00ealon, meaning\n\u2018unclear\u2019 and \u2018clear\u2019 respectively; thus, the\n\u2018adelic\u2019 conception of the criterion of truth is the one\nwhich emphasizes the role of the criterion in the discovery of\nunclear things, whereas the \u2018prodelic\u2019 conception\nis the one which emphasizes that those truths delivered by the\ncriterion are clearly true.) Brunschwig shows in detail that\nSextus conflates the two in his arguments against the criterion,\nalthough he acknowledges that this conflation does not dent the force\nof the objections that Sextus brings.\n\n\nSome of the flavour of Sextus\u2019 objections to the criterion can\nbe gleaned from the following passage (PH II 74\u20135):\n\n\n[74] Nor can we say that the soul apprehends external\nexisting objects through its sensory feelings inasmuch as the feelings\nof the senses are similar to the external existing objects. For how\nwill the intellect know whether the feelings of the senses are like the\nsense-objects, given that it does not itself come into contact with the\nexternal objects and that the senses make clear to it not the nature of\nthese objects but their own feelings, as we deduced from the modes of\nsuspension? [75] Just as someone who does not know Socrates but has\nlooked at a picture of him does not know whether the picture is like\nSocrates, so the intellect, studying the feelings of the senses but not\nobserving the external objects, will not know whether the feelings of\nthe senses are like the external existing objects. Therefore it cannot\nrely on similarity to judge them.\n\n\n\nRoughly speaking, Sextus is pointing out to the Epicureans and the\nStoics, both of whom attach great weight to the deliverance of the\nsenses, that there is no way that one\u2019s intellect can distinguish\namongst impressions those ones which are faithful to the way the world\nis: one only has access to one\u2019s impressions, and not the\nexternal world, so one cannot discern which of one\u2019s impressions\nare faithful to the external world, and assent to them alone. The\nintellect is impotent when it comes to deciding whether perceptual\nimpressions are to be an adequate criterion. (Sextus might be\nmisunderstanding the Stoic position here; see Frede 1983.)\n\n\nAt the end of Sextus\u2019 discussion in PH II, he clearly\nsignals, as one would expect, that he suspends judgment on whether\nthere are criteria of truth:\n\nYou must realize that it is not our\nintention to assert that standards of truth are unreal (that would be\ndogmatic); rather, since the Dogmatists seem plausibly to have\nestablished that there is a standard of truth, we have set up\nplausible-seeming arguments in opposition to them, affirming neither\nthat they are true nor that they are more plausible than those on the\ncontrary side, but concluding to suspension of judgement because of the\napparently equal plausibility of these arguments and those produced by\nthe Dogmatists. (PH II 79; cf. M VII 444)\n\n\nHow does Sextus\u2019 treatment of the criterion contribute to the\ndebate between scholars over the question of whether the Skeptic has\nany beliefs? The answer is that both Jonathan Barnes and Myles Burnyeat\nhave used Sextus\u2019 discussion of the criterion as a means of\nsecuring the conclusion that the Skeptic has no beliefs at all. Recall\nthat in PH I 13, Sextus says there are two meanings of the\nword dogma, according to the first of which the Skeptic\ndoes have dogmata, and according to the second of\nwhich, the Skeptic does not have dogmata. All\ncommentators are in agreement that the second kind of dogma is\nroughly to be understood as a \u2018philosophico-scientific\u2019\nopinion or tenet (Barnes 1982: 67), even if the parties to the debate\nhave a slightly different understanding of what a\n\u2018philosophico-scientific tenet\u2019 is (Morison 2011: 265\u20137).\nThe question is what kind of belief (if any kind at all) the first kind\nof dogma is. According to Barnes and Burnyeat, this first kind\nof dogma is something like the Skeptic\u2019s acknowledgment\nof his occurrent state of being appeared to in a certain way. Clearly,\naccording to Barnes and Burnyeat, this leaves a gap in Sextus\u2019\npresentation: \n what attitude does he take to ordinary beliefs?  The\nsentences of breakfast-time, bath-time, and bed-time\u2014\u2018The\nbutter\u2019s hard\u2019, \u2018The water\u2019s cold\u2019, \u2018The\nsprings are protruding\u2019\u2014do not express scientific\n \u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, nor\nyet do they serve in avowals. If we are concerned to discover the\nscope of \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae in\nPH, it is precisely such humdrum sentences which will most\nexercise us; yet of them Sextus says nothing. (Barnes 1982:\n75\u20136)\n\n\nBoth Barnes and Burnyeat end up claiming that these ordinary\neveryday beliefs actually end up being discarded along with the\ndogmata in the second sense. They argue this by claiming that\nSextus does not have a criterion of truth: the Skeptic \n needs a criterion of truth, to determine which [of\nconflicting appearances] he should accept. But the sceptic then\nargues, often at some length, that there is no intellectually\nsatisfying criterion we can trust and use\u2014this is the real\nbackbone of the discussion. (Burnyeat 1980: 29)\n\nBarnes puts it as follows: \n\nwe cannot affirm\nthat the water is tepid unless we have a criterion of truth\u2014a\nway of judging that the \n\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 with which\nthe water affects us corresponds to the actual state of the\nwater; (1982: 77) \n\nBut the thesis that there is a\ncriterion of truth is itself a\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u2014indeed, it is a perfect specimen of those philosophico-scientific\ntenets which the Greeks called\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1; (78)\n\n\nOrdinary beliefs are not\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u2026 Nonetheless, in\nrejecting \u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 the Pyrrhonist\nmust reject ordinary beliefs; for the possession of ordinary beliefs\npresupposes the possession of at least one\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u2014the\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 that there is a criterion of\ntruth. (ibid) (Cf. Burnyeat 1984: 115n. 36)\n\n\nBarnes\u2019 argument, however, is fallacious (for more detailed\ndiscussion, see Schwab 2013, whose main points are summarised here).\nThere are two fundamental flaws. First, the Hellenistic theory of the\ncriterion of truth was never supposed to be a theory about how\nbeliefs in general are formed, only beliefs which meet the\ncondition of being suitable for conferring knowledge. But second, and\nmore importantly, one needs to distinguish between suspending\njudgment on whether there is a criterion of truth, and failing\nto have a criterion of truth. Since the deliverances of the\nnatural capacity of perception are criteria of truth according to the\nEpicureans, there is nothing one can do, short of putting one\u2019s\neyes out, to bring it about that one lacks this criterion of truth;\nmerely suspending judgment on whether there is such a thing as a\ncriterion of truth won\u2019t do the job. Similarly, since it is\ncognitive impressions, according to the Stoics, which are criteria of\ntruth, there is nothing one can do to bring it about that one lacks\nthese criteria of truth, short of damaging one\u2019s capacity for\nforming impressions (one\u2019s phantasia); merely suspending\njudgment on whether there is a criterion of truth won\u2019t do the\njob. Barnes actually acknowledges this flaw in his argument in a\nfootnote: \n\n\nThe Pyrrhonian may possess a criterion even\nif he himself does not believe that he does; and in that case\nhe is in a position to judge that p (1982: 78n. 76)\n\n\nIn short, Barnes\u2019 and Burnyeat\u2019s appeal to the\ndiscussion of the criterion of truth is unconvincing as an attempt to\nshow that for the Pyrrhonian Skeptic, ordinary beliefs are off limits.\nThe urbane interpretation is still standing.\n4.2 Negative dogmatism in M VII\u2013XI?\n\n\nAnother pressing philosophical issue raised by M VII\u2013IX\nis the alleged difference in the skepticism evident in M XI\n(\u2018Against the Ethicists\u2019) as compared to PH. \nThere can be no doubt that in M, Sextus is much more willing\nto give the counterargument to the Dogmatists\u2019 positions without\nlaying out the corresponding positive arguments that the Dogmatists\ngives. This lends an air of negative dogmatism to M. However,\nthis is merely stylistic: there is also no doubt that Sextus frequently\nemphasizes in M that we shouldn\u2019t take his arguments\ndogmatically, e.g., at M VII 444; VIII 159, 476 (Frede 1973:\n808), or that the upshot of his argumentation is that one should\nsuspend judgment e.g., M VII 443; VIII 298; IX 137: 191\u20132; X\n168 (Bett 1997: xxix). But there are some passages in \u2018Against\nthe Ethicists\u2019 which are harder, at least at first sight, to\nbring into line with the doctrine of suspension of judgment in\nPH. Sextus stresses in the ethical section of PH III\nthat one should suspend judgment as to whether anything is good or bad\nby nature (e.g., PH III 235), and so it is no surprise that\n\u2018M XI argues for the conclusion that nothing is\nby nature good or bad\u2019 (Bett 1997: xiv)\u2014so much one would\nexpect by way of counterarguments to the Dogmatists\u2019 positive\narguments. But Sextus gets perilously close to saying that the skeptic\nshould embrace the conclusions of these counterarguments (Bett\n1997: xiv): \n\nthe freedom \u2018from the trouble associated with the opinion\nthat something bad or good is present\u2019 will \u2018come to him\nfrom his thinking nothing good or bad by nature\u2019\n(M XI 118; my emphasis);\n\u2018when reason has established that none of these\nthings is by nature good or by nature bad, there will be a release\nfrom disturbance and a peaceful life will await us\u2019 (M\nXI 130; my emphasis);\n\u2018It will only be possible to avoid this [sc. trouble], then,\nif we show to the person who is disturbed on account of his\navoidance of the bad or his pursuit of the good, that there is not\nanything either good or bad by nature\u2019 (M XI 140; my\nemphasis). \n\n\n The way to avoid saddling Sextus with an inconsistency is to\nsee that Sextus is not suggesting that the Skeptic must\nbelieve that nothing is good or bad by nature, but rather that\nthe Skeptic must have equally convincing arguments up his sleeve\nthat conclude that nothing is by nature good or bad\u2014once\nwe have managed that, \u2018there will be a release from disturbance\nand a peaceful life will await us\u2019. (For pushback against this, see Bett 2018: 13n. 24.)\n5. M I\u2013VI\n\n\nThe six books of M I\u2013VI, taken together, constitute an\nattack on the liberal arts. For their general aim, see Barnes 1988. The\nmost important feature of M I\u2013VI, which can be misleading, is\nthat in them, there is often the appearance of negative dogmatism, i.e.,\nof claims that this or that art doesn\u2019t exist. Take for example\nM I 90: \u2018So let this stand to show the non-existence of\ngrammar, at least on the grammarians\u2019 conception of it\u2019. Bett 2018: 11\u201315 urges us to view such moments as traces of a previous stage of Pyrrhonism. Alternatively,\nrather than interpret this as occasional departures from Sextus\u2019\nover-arching plan to induce suspension of judgment (which is in any\ncase still present in texts such as M I 6), one could take\nthese apparent statements of negative dogmatism to be \u2018the\nequipollent counterpoise to the technicians\u2019 arguments\u2019\n(Blank 1998: l, summarising Barnes 1988: 72\u20137). (See above 4.2 for a\nsimilar story about M XI.)\n\nI.\n M I 1\u201340 is a highly general introduction to all six\nworks, and then Against the Grammarians starts properly at I\n41. For this work, see Blank 1998. Against the Grammarians is\nmuch the longest of the six books, standing at 320 sections. There is\ndiscussion of the question \u2018What is Grammar?\u2019 (57\u201389), an\nattack on the \u2018expert\u2019 part of grammar, i.e., the part\nconcerned with letters, parts of speech, etc. (99\u2013247), and an attack\non the part of grammar which concerns poets and prose-writers\n(270\u2013320), i.e., the part which deals with the interpretation of poetry,\nand which Sextus argues is useless because it makes no contribution to\nhuman flourishing.\nII.\n Against the Rhetoricians is shorter, at only 113\nsections. It considers various definitions of what rhetoric is, what\nbenefit rhetoric is to individuals or to cities, what the goal of\nrhetoric is, and what the parts of rhetoric are, all with a view to\nattacking its status as an art.\nIII.\n Against the Geometers stands at 116 sections. It takes\ngeometers to task for their employment of hypotheses in establishing\ntheorems, and then attacks the hypotheses themselves, such as the\ndefinitions of body, point, line (particularly the definition of the\nline as \u2018length without breadth\u2019), and angle. For this\nwork, see Dye and Vitrac 2009.\nIV.\n Against the Arithmeticians has a mere 34 sections. This\nwork outlines the extraordinary views of the Pythagoreans concerning\nthe power of numbers, and then seeks to undermine them by arguing that\nPlatonic notion of a monad or unit (\u2018the One\u2019) is\n\u2018inconceivable\u2019 (17), adding as an aside that the notion of\na dyad doesn\u2019t fare much better (21\u201322), and by attacking the\nprinciples of addition and subtraction (23\u201333). \u2018But if number is\nconceived as subsisting through addition, as I said, and subtraction,\nand we have shown that neither of these exists, one must declare that\nnumber is nothing\u2019 (34). The work thus has a clear structure:\npresentation of arguments in favour of the existence of numbers (from\nthe Pythagoreans), followed by presentation of arguments against the\nexistence of numbers.\nV.\n Against the Astrologers, in 106 sections. Sextus attacks\nnot astronomy (1), which is one thing the term \u2018astrology\u2019\nreferred to in classical times, but \u2018the casting of\nnativities\u2019 (Bury\u2019s translation of the term\n\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b8\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\nin section 2) and horoscopes. The first half of the work involves\nSextus laying out the basics of the Chaldean theory of prognostication,\nand the second half contains his counterarguments, including\nfascinating observations about the difficulty of establishing when\nsomeone is conceived, the difficulty of establishing when they are born\n(\u2018is it when the child begins to emerge into the cold air, or\nwhen it has emerged a little, or when it is deposited on the\nground?\u2019, M V 65), and the difficulty of using accurate\ntime-keeping devices to detect which astronomical phenomena are\noccurring at what time.\nVI.\n Against the Musicians is in 68 sections. For this work,\nsee Greaves 1986; Bett 2013. Sextus attacks the standing of music as a science, by\nquestioning whether it is useful for happiness (7\u201337) and by\nquestioning whether it is a science at all (38\u201368), just as he did in\nthe case of grammar (a comparison Sextus himself makes at section 4).\nIn the first part, Sextus assembles arguments in favour of music being\nuseful for happiness (7\u201318) and arguments against (19\u201337); the second\npart consists wholly of the arguments against the existence of music as\na suitable subject for theoretical discourse, with Sextus leaving\nunstated the arguments in favour.\n\n6.
