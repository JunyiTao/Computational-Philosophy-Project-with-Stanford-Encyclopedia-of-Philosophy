    "main_text": "Objections to Functionalism || Functionalism and Holism\n5.1 Functionalism and Holism\n\nOne difficulty for every version of the theory is that functional\ncharacterization is holistic. Functionalists hold that mental\nstates are to be characterized in terms of their roles in a\npsychological theory \u2013 be it common sense, scientific, or\nsomething in between \u2013 but all such theories incorporate\ninformation about a large number and variety of mental states. Thus if\npain is interdefined with certain highly articulated beliefs and\ndesires, then animals who don\u2019t have internal states that play\nthe roles of our articulated beliefs and desires can\u2019t share our\npains, and humans without the capacity to feel pain can\u2019t share\ncertain (or perhaps any) of our beliefs and desires. In addition,\ndifferences in the ways people reason, the ways their beliefs are\nfixed, or the ways their desires affect their beliefs \u2013 due\neither to cultural or individual idiosyncrasies \u2013 might make it\nimpossible for them to share the same mental states. These are\nregarded as serious worries for all versions of functionalism (see\nStich 1983, Putnam 1988).\n\nSome functionalists, however (e.g. Lewis, 1972; Shoemaker 1984c), have\nsuggested that if a creature has states that approximately\nrealize our functional theories, or realize some more specific\ndefining subset of the theory particularly relevant to the\nspecification of those states, then they can qualify as being mental\nstates of the same types as our own. The problem, of course, is to\nspecify more precisely what it is to be an approximate realization of\na theory, or what exactly a \u201cdefining\u201d subset of a theory\nis intended to include, and these are not easy questions. (They have\nparticular bite, moreover, for analytic functionalist\ntheories, since specifying what belongs inside and outside the\n\u201cdefining\u201d subset of a functional characterization raises\nthe question of what are the conceptually essential, and what the\nmerely collateral, features of a mental state, and thus raise serious\nquestions about the feasibility of (something like) an\nanalytic-synthetic distinction. (Quine 1953, Rey 1997)).\n",
