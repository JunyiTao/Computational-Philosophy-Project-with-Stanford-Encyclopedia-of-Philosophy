    "main_text": "Selves: Human and Divine || A Causal Argument for God\u2019s Existence\n4.1 A Causal Argument for God\u2019s Existence\n\nA properly formulated Ny\u0101ya argument has three components:\nthesis, reason (hetu) and example\n(d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101nta). The thesis, again, has two\ncomponents: the \u2018locus\u2019 (pak\u1e63a) or place of\nthe inference, and a property (s\u0101dhya) whose presence in\nthe locus is to be inferred. Thus every Ny\u0101ya argument exhibits\nthe same pattern: p has S, because it has\nH; e.g., d. (For example: \u201cThe mountain ( =\np) has fire (= S), because it has smoke ( =\nH); e.g. the kitchen ( = d)\u201d. See further \u00a78). A\nsound argument must fulfil at least three criteria: (i) the reason\nproperty must be uncontroversially present in the locus; (ii) the\nreason property and the inferred property must be appropriately\nrelated, roughly such that wherever the reason is present, so is the\ninferred property; (iii) the example must be an uncontroversial place\nwhere both the reason property and the inferred property are\npresent.\n\nWith this in mind, let us consider The Manual of\nReason\u2019s argument for the existence of God:\n\nA dyad of earth etc. has a maker, because it is an effect; e.g. a pot\n(TSD 17b).\n\n\nHere, the locus of the inference is a dyad, the smallest composite\nentity. The reason is \u201cbeing an effect\u201d\n(k\u0101ryatva), and the inferred property is \u201chaving a\nmaker\u201d (kart\u1e5b-janyatva). The Manual of\nReason carefully defines what it means by a \u2018maker\u2019:\na thing which is non-inferentially aware of the inherent or material\ncause of the thing to be made, has a desire to make it, and acts\naccordingly. In this sense, the potter, but not the potter\u2019s\nwheel or the clay or any other causally relevant feature, is the maker\nof the pot, for it is the potter who sees the clay (= material cause\nof the pot), desires to make a pot, and acts accordingly by using the\nwheel and stick.\n\nComments: (1) Why does The Manual of Reason take dyads to be\nthe locus of the inference? This is, in fact, a clever move.\nObviously, we cannot take God to be the locus (e.g. God exists,\nbecause\u2026), for then the first criterion on a sound inference\nwill not be met\u2014the reason property, whatever it is, cannot be\nuncontroversially present in a locus whose very existence is\ncontroversial. We can\u2019t take the locus to be \u201ceverything\nin the world\u201d, for many such things are not effects (e.g. atoms,\nspace) and so The Manual of Reason\u2019s desired reason\nwill again not be unequivocally present in the locus. Hence, we must\npick some particular thing. We had better not choose a human artefact,\nfor the inference, even if sound, would then establish nothing about\nGod. From the class of non-artefacts, the choice of dyads is a good\none here, for (a) they are the most basic things made out of the\natoms, and hence out of which everything else is made, and (b) if\nThe Manual of Reason can show that these have a maker, then\nit follows that the maker is aware of everything (from the definition\nof a maker and (a) above). Thus, God\u2019s omniscience will be a\ncorollary of the proof of his existence.\n\n(2) The argument takes the picture of causation used in the\n\u201cpotter-pot\u201d example and extends it to cover all natural\nphenomena. God\u2019s function is to make things out of the given and\nuncreated ingredients (the atoms, cf. the clay), which are the\nproducts\u2019 material cause. Matilal accordingly describes the\nNy\u0101ya as having a \u201cpotter model\u201d of God, in contrast\nwith a \u201cspider model\u201d, in which God spins the world out of\nhis own essence, or a \u201cmagician\u201d model, in which the world\nis an illusion conjured up by God. The argument, however, rests upon\nan anthropomorphic and agentive view of causation. The Buddhist\nDharmak\u012brti ridiculed the argument by likening the pot to an\nanti-hill (another thing made of clay): should we say that this\nadmittedly complex and intricate construction is the product of\nintelligent agents? And even if we do, why should not the world, like\nan ant-hill be a product of collective agency, rather than produced by\na single agent?\n\n(3) The argument might be thought of as an argument based on\ninduction, induction from the class of artefacts to the class of\nnatural products. What licenses the induction from things seen to have\na maker to things not so seen? Dharmak\u012brti (cf. Vattanky 1984:\n56\u20138) says that we are licensed to infer that an object has a\nmaker only if we have seen other objects of the same type being made.\nThus, we can infer that the Pyramids had a maker, not because we can\nsee that maker, but because the Pyramids belong to a type (buildings)\nother instances of which we have seen made. The Naiy\u0101yika makes a\nbolder inductive claim, that two object belong to the same\n\u2018type\u2019, in this sense, if they are both effects.\n",
