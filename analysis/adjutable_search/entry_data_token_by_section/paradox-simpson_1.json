    "main_text": "Definition and Mathematical Characterization\n2. Definition and Mathematical Characterization\n\nThis section shows how Simpson\u2019s Paradox can be characterized\nmathematically, under which conditions it occurs, and how it can be\navoided. We begin by further considering the concrete example from the\nintroduction in order to build intuitions that will guide us through\nthe more technical results.\n\nThe data in\n Table 1\n can be translated into success or recovery rates, showing that\ntreated men have a higher recovery rate than untreated men (roughly\n61% vs. 57%), and the same for women (44% vs. 40%). Two observations\nare key to understanding why this positive association vanishes in the\naggregate data. First, the recovery rate of untreated men is still\nhigher than the recovery rate of women who receive treatment (57% vs.\n44%), suggesting that not only treatment, but also gender is a\nrelevant predictor of recovery. Second, while the treatment group is\nmajority female (27 vs. 13), the control group is majority male (7 vs.\n5). Speaking informally, the lack of population-level correlation\nbetween treatment and recovery results from men being both (i) more\nlikely to recover from the treatment, and (ii) less likely to be in\nthe treatment group.\n\nThis becomes evident when we use conditional probabilities to\nrepresent recovery rates given treatment and/or subpopulation. The\noverall recovery rates given treatment and control can, by the Law of\nTotal Probability, be written as the weighted average of recovery\nrates in the subpopulations:  \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\np(\\r{S}\\mid \\r{T}) &= p(\\r{S}\\mid \\r{T},\\r{M}) p(\\r{M}\\mid \\r{T}) + p(\\r{S}\\mid \\r{T}, \\neg \\r{M}) p(\\neg \\r{M}\\mid \\r{T}) \\\\  \np(\\r{S}\\mid \\neg \\r{T}) &= p(\\r{S}\\mid \\neg \\r{T},\\r{M}) p(\\r{M}\\mid \\neg \\r{T}) + p(\\r{S}\\mid \\neg \\r{T}, \\neg \\r{M}) p(\\neg \\r{M}\\mid \\neg \\r{T})\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nPlugging in the numbers from\n Table 1\n to calculate the overall recovery rates via these equations, we see\nthat the first line is a weighted average of success rates for treated\nmen and women (61% and 44%) while the second line is a weighted\naverage of success rates of the two control groups (57% and 40%).\nThese averages are weighted by the percentage of males and females in\neach group, and in the present case the gender disparity between the\ngroups results in both averages being 50%. Since these weights can be\ndifferent, the treatment may raise the probability of success among males and females\nwithout doing so in the combined population.\n\nLater we will show that the positive association in the subpopulations\ncannot vanish if the correlation of treatment with gender is broken\n(e.g., by balancing gender rates in both conditions). The weights in\neach line are then identical\u2014\\(p(\\r{M}\\mid \\r{T}) =\np(\\r{M}\\mid \\neg \\r{T})\\)\u2014and associations in subpopulations\nare preserved for the aggregate data\n (Theorem 1 in Section 2.2).\n In fact, the absence of such a correlation rules out Simpson\u2019s\nParadox.\n",
