There are two distinct reasons for\nthis.\n\nFirst, the real reason many of us are unwilling to abandon\nthe notion of the actual infinite in mathematics is the prevalent\nconception of an irrational number as a necessarily infinite\nextension. \u201cThe confusion in the concept of the \u2018actual\ninfinite\u2019 arises\u201d (italics added), says\nWittgenstein (PG 471), \n\n\nfrom the unclear concept of irrational number, that is, from the fact\nthat logically very different things are called \u2018irrational\nnumbers\u2019 without any clear limit being given to the concept.\n\n\nSecond, and more fundamentally, the intermediate Wittgenstein wrestles\nwith irrationals in such detail because he opposes foundationalism and\nespecially its concept of a \u201cgapless mathematical\ncontinuum\u201d, its concept of a comprehensive theory of\nthe real numbers (Han 2010), and set theoretical conceptions and\n\u2018proofs\u2019 as a foundation for arithmetic, real number\ntheory, and mathematics as a whole. Indeed, Wittgenstein\u2019s\ndiscussion of irrationals is one with his critique of set theory, for,\nas he says, \u201c[m]athematics is ridden through and through with\nthe pernicious idioms of set theory\u201d, such as \u201cthe way\npeople speak of a line as composed of points\u201d, when, in fact,\n\u201c[a] line is a law and isn\u2019t composed of anything at\nall\u201d (PR \u00a7173; PR \u00a7\u00a7181, 183,\n& 191; PG 373, 460, 461, & 473).\n2.5.1 Wittgenstein\u2019s Anti-Foundationalism and Genuine Irrational Numbers\n\nSince, on Wittgenstein\u2019s terms, mathematics consists exclusively\nof extensions and intensions (i.e., \u2018rules\u2019 or\n\u2018laws\u2019), an irrational is only an extension insofar as it\nis a sign (i.e., a \u2018numeral\u2019, such as\n\u2018\\(\\sqrt{2}\\)\u2019 or \u2018\\(\\pi\\)\u2019). Given that there\nis no such thing as an infinite mathematical extension, it\nfollows that an irrational number is not a unique infinite\nexpansion, but rather a unique recursive rule or law\n(PR \u00a7181) that yields rational numbers (PR\n\u00a7186; PR \u00a7180).\n\n\nThe rule for working out places of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is itself the numeral\nfor the irrational number; and the reason I here speak of a\n\u2018number\u2019 is that I can calculate with these signs (certain\nrules for the construction of rational numbers) just as I can with\nrational numbers themselves. (PG 484)\n\n\nDue, however, to his anti-foundationalism, Wittgenstein takes the\nradical position that not all recursive real numbers (i.e., computable\nnumbers) are genuine real numbers\u2014a position that distinguishes\nhis view from even Brouwer\u2019s.\n\nThe problem, as Wittgenstein sees it, is that mathematicians,\nespecially foundationalists (e.g., set theorists), have sought to\naccommodate physical continuity by a theory that\n\u2018describes\u2019 the mathematical continuum (PR\n\u00a7171). When, for example, we think of continuous motion and the\n(mere) density of the rationals, we reason that if an object moves\ncontinuously from A to B, and it travels only the distances\nmarked by \u201crational points\u201d, then it must skip\nsome distances (intervals, or points) not marked by rational\nnumbers. But if an object in continuous motion travels distances that\ncannot be commensurately measured by rationals alone, there\nmust be \u2018gaps\u2019 between the rationals (PG 460),\nand so we must fill them, first, with recursive irrationals, and then,\nbecause \u201cthe set of all recursive irrationals\u201d\nstill leaves gaps, with \u201clawless irrationals\u201d.\n\n\n[T]he enigma of the continuum arises because language misleads us into\napplying to it a picture that doesn\u2019t fit. Set theory preserves\nthe inappropriate picture of something discontinuous, but makes\nstatements about it that contradict the picture, under the impression\nthat it is breaking with prejudices; whereas what should really have\nbeen done is to point out that the picture just doesn\u2019t\nfit\u2026 (PG 471)\n\n\nWe add nothing that is needed to the differential and integral calculi\nby \u2018completing\u2019 a theory of real numbers with\npseudo-irrationals and lawless irrationals, first because there are no\ngaps on the number line (PR \u00a7\u00a7181, 183, & 191;\nPG 373, 460, 461, & 473; WVC 35) and, second,\nbecause these alleged irrational numbers are not needed for a theory\nof the \u2018continuum\u2019 simply because there is no mathematical\ncontinuum. As the later Wittgenstein says (RFM V, \u00a732),\n\u201c[t]he picture of the number line is an absolutely natural one\nup to a certain point; that is to say so long as it is not used for a\ngeneral theory of real numbers\u201d. We have gone awry by\nmisconstruing the nature of the geometrical line as a continuous\ncollection of points, each with an associated real number, which has\ntaken us well beyond the \u2018natural\u2019 picture of the number\nline in search of a \u201cgeneral theory of real numbers\u201d (Han\n2010).\n\nThus, the principal reason Wittgenstein rejects certain constructive\n(computable) numbers is that they are unnecessary creations which\nengender conceptual confusions in mathematics (especially set theory).\nOne of Wittgenstein\u2019s main aims in his lengthy discussions of\nrational numbers and pseudo-irrationals is to show that\npseudo-irrationals, which are allegedly needed for the mathematical\ncontinuum, are not needed at all.\n\nTo this end, Wittgenstein demands (a) that a real number must be\n\u201ccompar[able] with any rational number taken at random\u201d\n(i.e., \u201cit can be established whether it is greater than, less\nthan, or equal to a rational number\u201d (PR \u00a7191))\nand (b) that \u201c[a] number must measure in and of itself\u201d\nand if a \u2018number\u2019 \u201cleaves it to the rationals, we\nhave no need of it\u201d (PR \u00a7191) (Frascolla 1980:\n242\u2013243; Shanker 1987: 186\u2013192; Da Silva 1993:\n93\u201394; Marion 1995a: 162, 164; Rodych 1999b, 281\u2013291;\nLampert 2009).\n\nTo demonstrate that some recursive (computable) reals are not genuine\nreal numbers because they fail to satisfy (a) and (b), Wittgenstein\ndefines the putative recursive real number \n\n\\[\n\\substack{5 \\rightarrow 3 \\\\ \\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\n\nas the rule \u201cConstruct the decimal expansion for \\(\\sqrt{2}\\),\nreplacing every occurrence of a \u20185\u2019 with a\n\u20183\u2019\u201d (PR \u00a7182); he similarly defines\n\\(\\pi '\\) as \n\n\\[\n\\substack{7 \\rightarrow 3\\\\ \\pi}\n\\]\n\n\n(PR \u00a7186) and, in a later work, redefines \\(\\pi '\\)\nas \n\n\\[\n\\substack{777 \\rightarrow 000 \\\\ \\pi}\n\\]\n\n\n(PG 475).\n\nAlthough a pseudo-irrational such as \\(\\pi '\\) (on either definition)\nis \u201cas unambiguous as \u2026 \\(\\pi\\) or \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)\u201d\n(PG 476), it is \u2018homeless\u2019 according to\nWittgenstein because, instead of using \u201cthe idioms of\narithmetic\u201d (PR \u00a7186), it is dependent upon the\nparticular \u2018incidental\u2019 notation of a particular system\n(i.e., in some particular base) (PR \u00a7188; PR\n\u00a7182; and PG 475). If we speak of various\nbase-notational systems, we might say that \\(\\pi\\) belongs to\nall systems, while \\(\\pi '\\) belongs only to one, which shows\nthat \\(\\pi '\\) is not a genuine irrational because \u201cthere\ncan\u2019t be irrational numbers of different types\u201d\n(PR \u00a7180). Furthermore, pseudo-irrationals do\nnot measure because they are homeless, artificial\nconstructions parasitic upon numbers which have a natural place in a\ncalculus that can be used to measure. We simply do not need these\naberrations, because they are not sufficiently comparable to rationals\nand genuine irrationals. They are not irrational numbers\naccording to Wittgenstein\u2019s criteria, which define, Wittgenstein\ninterestingly asserts, \u201cprecisely what has been meant or looked\nfor under the name \u2018irrational number\u2019\u201d (PR\n\u00a7191).\n\nFor exactly the same reason, if we define a \u201clawless\nirrational\u201d as either (a) a non-rule-governed,\nnon-periodic, infinite expansion in some base, or (b) a\n\u201cfree-choice sequence\u201d, Wittgenstein rejects\n\u201clawless irrationals\u201d because, insofar as they are not\nrule-governed, they are not comparable to rationals (or irrationals)\nand they are not needed. \n\n\n[W]e cannot say that the decimal fractions developed in accordance\nwith a law still need supplementing by an infinite set of irregular\ninfinite decimal fractions that would be \u2018brushed under the\ncarpet\u2019 if we were to restrict ourselves to those\ngenerated by a law, \n\n\nWittgenstein argues, for \u201c[w]here is there such an infinite\ndecimal that is generated by no law\u201d \u201c[a]nd how would we\nnotice that it was missing?\u201d (PR \u00a7181; cf.\nPG 473, 483\u201384). Similarly, a free-choice sequence,\nlike a recipe for \u201cendless bisection\u201d or \u201cendless\ndicing\u201d, is not an infinitely complicated mathematical\nlaw (or rule), but rather no law at all, for after each\nindividual throw of a coin, the point remains \u201cinfinitely\nindeterminate\u201d (PR \u00a7186). For closely related\nreasons, Wittgenstein ridicules the Multiplicative Axiom (Axiom of\nChoice) both in the middle period (PR \u00a7146) and in the\nlatter period (RFM V, \u00a725; VII, \u00a733).\n2.5.2 Wittgenstein\u2019s Real Number Essentialism and the Dangers of Set Theory\n\nSuperficially, at least, it seems as if Wittgenstein is offering an\nessentialist argument for the conclusion that real number arithmetic\nshould not be extended in such-and-such a way. Such an\nessentialist account of real and irrational numbers seems to\nconflict with the actual freedom mathematicians have to extend and\ninvent, with Wittgenstein\u2019s intermediate claim (PG 334)\nthat \u201c[f]or [him] one calculus is as good as another\u201d, and\nwith Wittgenstein\u2019s acceptance of complex and imaginary numbers.\nWittgenstein\u2019s foundationalist critic (e.g., set theorist) will\nundoubtedly say that we have extended the term \u201cirrational\nnumber\u201d to lawless and pseudo-irrationals because they are\nneeded for the mathematical continuum and because such\n\u201cconceivable numbers\u201d are much more like rule-governed\nirrationals than rationals.\n\nThough Wittgenstein stresses differences where others see similarities\n(LFM 15), in his intermediate attacks on pseudo-irrationals\nand foundationalism, he is not just emphasizing differences, he is\nattacking set theory\u2019s \u201cpernicious idioms\u201d\n(PR \u00a7173) and its \u201ccrudest imaginable\nmisinterpretation of its own calculus\u201d (PG\n469\u201370) in an attempt to dissolve \u201cmisunderstandings\nwithout which [set theory] would never have been invented\u201d,\nsince it is \u201cof no other use\u201d (LFM 16\u201317).\nComplex and imaginary numbers have grown organically within\nmathematics, and they have proved their mettle in scientific\napplications, but pseudo-irrationals are inorganic creations\ninvented solely for the sake of mistaken foundationalist aims.\nWittgenstein\u2019s main point is not that we cannot create\nfurther recursive real numbers\u2014indeed, we can create as many as\nwe want\u2014his point is that we can only really speak of different\nsystems (sets) of real numbers (RFM II, \u00a733)\nthat are enumerable by a rule, and any attempt to speak of \u201cthe\nset of all real numbers\u201d or any piecemeal attempt to add or\nconsider new recursive reals (e.g., diagonal numbers) is a useless\nand/or futile endeavour based on foundational misconceptions. Indeed,\nin 1930 manuscript and typescript (hereafter MS and TS, respectively)\npassages on irrationals and Cantor\u2019s diagonal, which were not\nincluded in PR or PG, Wittgenstein says: \u201cThe\nconcept \u2018irrational number\u2019 is a dangerous\npseudo-concept\u201d (MS 108, 176; 1930; TS 210, 29; 1930).  As we\nshall see in the next section, on Wittgenstein\u2019s account, if we\ndo not understand irrationals rightly, we cannot but engender\nthe mistakes that constitute set theory.\n2.6 Wittgenstein\u2019s Intermediate Critique of Set Theory\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s critique of set theory begins somewhat benignly\nin the Tractatus, where he denounces Logicism and says\n(6.031) that \u201c[t]he theory of classes is completely superfluous\nin mathematics\u201d because, at least in part, \u201cthe generality\nrequired in mathematics is not accidental generality\u201d. In his\nmiddle period, Wittgenstein begins a full-out assault on set theory\nthat never abates. Set theory, he says, is \u201cutter\nnonsense\u201d (PR \u00a7\u00a7145, 174; WVC 102;\nPG 464, 470), \u2018wrong\u2019 (PR \u00a7174),\nand \u2018laughable\u2019 (PG 464); its \u201cpernicious\nidioms\u201d (PR \u00a7173) mislead us and the crudest\npossible misinterpretation is the very impetus of its invention\n(Hintikka 1993: 24, 27).\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s intermediate critique of transfinite set theory\n(hereafter \u201cset theory\u201d) has two main components: (1) his\ndiscussion of the intension-extension distinction, and (2) his\ncriticism of non-denumerability as cardinality. Late in the\nmiddle period, Wittgenstein seems to become more aware of the\nunbearable conflict between his strong formalism (PG\n334) and his denigration of set theory as a purely formal,\nnon-mathematical calculus (Rodych 1997: 217\u2013219),\nwhich, as we shall see in\n Section 3.5,\n leads to the use of an extra-mathematical application criterion to\ndemarcate transfinite set theory (and other purely formal sign-games)\nfrom mathematical calculi.\n2.6.1 Intensions, Extensions, and the Fictitious Symbolism of Set Theory\n\nThe search for a comprehensive theory of the real numbers and\nmathematical continuity has led to a \u201cfictitious\nsymbolism\u201d (PR \u00a7174).\n\n\nSet theory attempts to grasp the infinite at a more general level than\nthe investigation of the laws of the real numbers. It says that you\ncan\u2019t grasp the actual infinite by means of mathematical\nsymbolism at all and therefore it can only be described and not\nrepresented. \u2026 One might say of this theory that it buys a pig\nin a poke. Let the infinite accommodate itself in this box as best it\ncan. (PG 468; cf. PR \u00a7170)\n\n\nAs Wittgenstein puts it at (PG 461), \n\n\nthe mistake in the set-theoretical approach consists time and again in\ntreating laws and enumerations (lists) as essentially the same kind of\nthing and arranging them in parallel series so that one fills in gaps\nleft by the other. \n\n\nThis is a mistake because it is \u2018nonsense\u2019 to say\n\u201cwe cannot enumerate all the numbers of a set, but we can give a\ndescription\u201d, for \u201c[t]he one is not a substitute for the\nother\u201d (WVC 102; June 19, 1930); \u201cthere\nisn\u2019t a dualism [of] the law and the infinite series obeying\nit\u201d (PR \u00a7180).\n\n\u201cSet theory is wrong\u201d and nonsensical (PR\n\u00a7174), says Wittgenstein, because it presupposes a fictitious\nsymbolism of infinite signs (PG 469) instead of an actual\nsymbolism with finite signs. The grand intimation of set theory, which\nbegins with \u201cDirichlet\u2019s concept of a function\u201d\n(WVC 102\u201303), is that we can in principle\nrepresent an infinite set by an enumeration, but because of human or\nphysical limitations, we will instead describe it\nintensionally. But, says Wittgenstein, \u201c[t]here can\u2019t be\npossibility and actuality in mathematics\u201d, for mathematics is an\nactual calculus, which \u201cis concerned only with the\nsigns with which it actually operates\u201d (PG\n469). As Wittgenstein puts it at (PR \u00a7159), the fact\nthat \u201cwe can\u2019t describe mathematics, we can only do\nit\u201d in and \u201cof itself abolishes every \u2018set\ntheory\u2019\u201d.\n\nPerhaps the best example of this phenomenon is Dedekind, who in giving\nhis \u2018definition\u2019 of an \u201cinfinite class\u201d as\n\u201ca class which is similar to a proper subclass of itself\u201d\n(PG 464), \u201ctried to describe an infinite\nclass\u201d (PG 463). If, however, we try to apply this\n\u2018definition\u2019 to a particular class in order to ascertain\nwhether it is finite or infinite, the attempt is\n\u2018laughable\u2019 if we apply it to a finite class,\nsuch as \u201ca certain row of trees\u201d, and it is\n\u2018nonsense\u2019 if we apply it to \u201can infinite\nclass\u201d, for we cannot even attempt \u201cto co-ordinate\nit\u201d (PG 464), because \u201cthe relation \\(m = 2n\\)\n[does not] correlate the class of all numbers with one of its\nsubclasses\u201d (PR \u00a7141), it is an \u201cinfinite\nprocess\u201d which \u201ccorrelates any arbitrary number with\nanother\u201d. So, although we can use \\(m = 2n\\) on the\nrule for generating the naturals (i.e., our domain) and\nthereby construct the pairs (2,1), (4,2), (6,3), (8,4), etc., in doing\nso we do not correlate two infinite sets or extensions\n(WVC 103). If we try to apply Dedekind\u2019s definition as\na criterion for determining whether a given set is infinite\nby establishing a 1\u20131 correspondence between two inductive rules\nfor generating \u201cinfinite extensions\u201d, one of which is an\n\u201cextensional subset\u201d of the other, we can\u2019t possibly\nlearn anything we didn\u2019t already know when we applied the\n\u2018criterion\u2019 to two inductive rules. If Dedekind or anyone\nelse insists on calling an inductive rule an \u201cinfinite\nset\u201d, he and we must still mark the categorical difference\nbetween such a set and a finite set with a determinate, finite\ncardinality.\n\nIndeed, on Wittgenstein\u2019s account, the failure to properly\ndistinguish mathematical extensions and intensions is the root cause\nof the mistaken interpretation of Cantor\u2019s diagonal proof as a\nproof of the existence of infinite sets of lesser and greater\ncardinality.\n2.6.2 Against Non-Denumerability\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s criticism of non-denumerability is primarily\nimplicit during the middle period. Only after 1937 does he provide\nconcrete arguments purporting to show, e.g., that Cantor\u2019s\ndiagonal cannot prove that some infinite sets have greater\n\u2018multiplicity\u2019 than others.\n\nNonetheless, the intermediate Wittgenstein clearly rejects the notion\nthat a non-denumerably infinite set is greater in cardinality than a\ndenumerably infinite set.\n\n\nWhen people say \u2018The set of all transcendental numbers is\ngreater than that of algebraic numbers\u2019, that\u2019s nonsense.\nThe set is of a different kind. It isn\u2019t \u2018no longer\u2019\ndenumerable, it\u2019s simply not denumerable! (PR\n\u00a7174)\n\n\nAs with his intermediate views on genuine irrationals and the\nMultiplicative Axiom, Wittgenstein here looks at the diagonal proof of\nthe non-denumerability of \u201cthe set of transcendental\nnumbers\u201d as one that shows only that transcendental numbers\ncannot be recursively enumerated. It is nonsense, he says, to go from\nthe warranted conclusion that these numbers are not, in principle,\nenumerable to the conclusion that the set of transcendental\nnumbers is greater in cardinality than the set of algebraic numbers,\nwhich is recursively enumerable. What we have here are two very\ndifferent conceptions of a number-type. In the case of algebraic\nnumbers, we have a decision procedure for determining of any given\nnumber whether or not it is algebraic, and we have a method\nof enumerating the algebraic numbers such that we can see\nthat \u2018each\u2019 algebraic number \u201cwill be\u201d\nenumerated. In the case of transcendental numbers, on the other hand,\nwe have proofs that some numbers are transcendental (i.e.,\nnon-algebraic), and we have a proof that we cannot\nrecursively enumerate each and every thing we would call a\n\u201ctranscendental number\u201d.\n\nAt (PG 461), Wittgenstein similarly speaks of set\ntheory\u2019s \u201cmathematical pseudo-concepts\u201d leading to a\nfundamental difficulty, which begins when we unconsciously presuppose\nthat there is sense to the idea of ordering the rationals by\nsize\u2014\u201cthat the attempt is\nthinkable\u201d\u2014and culminates in similarly thinking that it is\npossible to enumerate the real numbers, which we then\ndiscover is impossible.\n\nThough the intermediate Wittgenstein certainly seems highly critical\nof the alleged proof that some infinite sets (e.g., the reals) are\ngreater in cardinality than other infinite sets, and though he\ndiscusses the \u201cdiagonal procedure\u201d in February 1929 and in\nJune 1930 (MS 106, 266; MS 108, 180), along with a diagonal diagram,\nthese and other early-middle ruminations did not make it into the\ntypescripts for either PR or PG. As we shall see in\n Section 3.4,\n the later Wittgenstein analyzes Cantor\u2019s diagonal and claims of\nnon-denumerability in some detail.\n3. The Later Wittgenstein on Mathematics: Some Preliminaries\n\nThe first and most important thing to note about Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlater Philosophy of Mathematics is that RFM, first published\nin 1956, consists of selections taken from a number of\nmanuscripts (1937\u20131944), most of one large typescript (1938),\nand three short typescripts (1938), each of which constitutes an\nAppendix to (RFM I). For this reason and because some\nmanuscripts containing much material on mathematics (e.g., MS 123)\nwere not used at all for\nRFM, philosophers have not been able to read\nWittgenstein\u2019s later remarks on mathematics as they were written\nin the manscripts used for RFM and they have not had access\n(until the 2000\u20132001 release of the Nachlass on CD-ROM)\nto much of Wittgenstein\u2019s later work on mathematics. It must be\nemphasized, therefore, that this Encyclopedia article is\nbeing written during a transitional period. Until philosophers have\nused the Nachlass to build a comprehensive picture of\nWittgenstein\u2019s complete and evolving Philosophy of Mathematics,\nwe will not be able to say definitively which views the later\nWittgenstein retained, which he changed, and which he dropped. In the\ninterim, this article will outline Wittgenstein\u2019s later\nPhilosophy of Mathematics, drawing primarily on RFM, to a\nmuch lesser extent LFM (1939 Cambridge lectures), and, where\npossible, previously unpublished material in Wittgenstein\u2019s\nNachlass.\n\nIt should also be noted at the outset that commentators disagree about\nthe continuity of Wittgenstein\u2019s middle and later Philosophies\nof Mathematics. Some argue that the later views are significantly\ndifferent from the intermediate views (Frascolla 1994; Gerrard 1991:\n127, 131\u201332; Floyd 2005: 105\u2013106), while others argue\nthat, for the most part, Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophy of\nMathematics evolves from the middle to the later period without\nsignificant changes or renunciations (Wrigley 1993; Marion 1998). The remainder of this article adopts the\nsecond interpretation, explicating Wittgenstein\u2019s later\nPhilosophy of Mathematics as largely continuous with his intermediate\nviews, except for the important introduction of an extra-mathematical\napplication criterion.\n3.1 Mathematics as a Human Invention\n\nPerhaps the most important constant in Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophy\nof Mathematics, middle and late, is that he consistently maintains\nthat mathematics is our, human invention, and that, indeed, everything\nin mathematics is invented. Just as the middle Wittgenstein says that\n\u201c[w]e make mathematics\u201d, the later Wittgenstein\nsays that we \u2018invent\u2019 mathematics (RFM I,\n\u00a7168; II, \u00a738; V, \u00a7\u00a75, 9 and 11; PG\n469\u201370) and that \u201cthe mathematician is not a discoverer:\nhe is an inventor\u201d (RFM, Appendix II, \u00a72;\n(LFM 22, 82). Nothing exists mathematically unless\nand until we have invented it.\n\nIn arguing against mathematical discovery, Wittgenstein is not just\nrejecting Platonism, he is also rejecting a rather standard\nphilosophical view according to which human beings invent mathematical\ncalculi, but once a calculus has been invented, we thereafter discover\nfinitely many of its infinitely many provable and true theorems. As\nWittgenstein himself asks (RFM IV, \u00a748), \u201cmight it\nnot be said that the rules lead this way, even if no one went\nit?\u201d If \u201csomeone produced a proof [of\n\u2018Goldbach\u2019s theorem\u2019]\u201d,\n\u201c[c]ouldn\u2019t one say\u201d, Wittgenstein asks\n(LFM 144), \u201cthat the possibility of this proof\nwas a fact in the realms of mathematical reality\u201d\u2014that\n\u201c[i]n order [to] find it, it must in some sense be\nthere\u201d\u2014\u201c[i]t must be a possible\nstructure\u201d?\n\nUnlike many or most philosophers of mathematics, Wittgenstein resists\nthe \u2018Yes\u2019 answer that we discover truths about a\nmathematical calculus that come into existence the moment we\ninvent the calculus (PR \u00a7141; PG 283, 466;\nLFM 139). Wittgenstein rejects the modal reification of\npossibility as actuality\u2014that provability and constructibility\nare (actual) facts\u2014by arguing that it is at the very least\nwrong-headed to say with the Platonist that because \u201ca straight\nline can be drawn between any two points,\u2026 the line\nalready exists even if no one has drawn it\u201d\u2014to say\n\u201c[w]hat in the ordinary world we call a possibility is in the\ngeometrical world a reality\u201d (LFM 144; RFM I,\n\u00a721). One might as well say, Wittgenstein suggests (PG\n374), that \u201cchess only had to be discovered, it was\nalways there!\u201d\n\nAt MS 122 (3v; Oct. 18, 1939), Wittgenstein once again emphasizes the\ndifference between illusory mathematical discovery and genuine\nmathematical invention.\n\n\nI want to get away from the formulation: \u201cI now know more about\nthe calculus\u201d, and replace it with \u201cI now have a different\ncalculus\u201d. The sense of this is always to keep before\none\u2019s eyes the full scale of the gulf between a mathematical\nknowing and non-mathematical\n knowing.[3]\n\n\nAnd as with the middle period, the later Wittgenstein similarly says\n(MS 121, 27r; May 27, 1938) that \u201c[i]t helps if one says: the\nproof of the Fermat proposition is not to be discovered, but to be\ninvented\u201d.\n\n\nThe difference between the \u2018anthropological\u2019 and the\nmathematical account is that in the first we are not tempted to speak\nof \u2018mathematical facts\u2019, but rather that in this account\nthe facts are never mathematical ones, never make\nmathematical propositions true or false. (MS 117, 263; March\n15, 1940)\n\n\nThere are no mathematical facts just as there are no (genuine)\nmathematical propositions. Repeating his intermediate view, the later\nWittgenstein says (MS 121, 71v; 27 Dec., 1938): \u201cMathematics\nconsists of [calculi | calculations], not of propositions\u201d. This\nradical constructivist conception of mathematics prompts Wittgenstein\nto make notorious remarks\u2014remarks that virtually no one else\nwould make\u2014such as the infamous (RFM V, \u00a79):\n\u201cHowever queer it sounds, the further expansion of an irrational\nnumber is a further expansion of mathematics\u201d.\n3.1.1 Wittgenstein\u2019s Later Anti-Platonism: The Natural History of Numbers and the Vacuity of Platonism\n\nAs in the middle period, the later Wittgenstein maintains that\nmathematics is essentially syntactical and non-referential, which, in\nand of itself, makes Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy of mathematics\nanti-Platonist insofar as Platonism is the view that mathematical\nterms and propositions refer to objects and/or facts and that\nmathematical propositions are true by virtue of agreeing with\nmathematical facts.\n\nThe later Wittgenstein, however, wishes to \u2018warn\u2019 us that\nour thinking is saturated with the idea of \u201c[a]rithmetic as the\nnatural history (mineralogy) of numbers\u201d (RFM IV,\n\u00a711). When, for instance, Wittgenstein discusses the claim that\nfractions cannot be ordered by magnitude, he says that this sounds\n\u2018remarkable\u2019 in a way that a mundane proposition of the\ndifferential calculus does not, for the latter proposition is\nassociated with an application in physics, \n\n\nwhereas this proposition \u2026 seems to\n[solely] concern\u2026 the natural history of\nmathematical objects themselves. (RFM II, \u00a740) \n\n\nWittgenstein stresses that he is trying to \u2018warn\u2019 us\nagainst this \u2018aspect\u2019\u2014the idea that the foregoing\nproposition about fractions \u201cintroduces us to the mysteries of\nthe mathematical world\u201d, which exists somewhere as a completed\ntotality, awaiting our prodding and our discoveries. The fact that we\nregard mathematical propositions as being about mathematical objects\nand mathematical investigation \u201cas the exploration of these\nobjects\u201d is \u201calready mathematical alchemy\u201d, claims\nWittgenstein (RFM V, \u00a716), since \n\n\nit is not possible to appeal to the meaning\n[Bedeutung] of the signs in\nmathematics,\u2026 because it is only mathematics that gives them\ntheir meaning [Bedeutung]. \n\n\nPlatonism is dangerously misleading, according to\nWittgenstein, because it suggests a picture of pre-existence,\npredetermination and discovery that is completely at odds\nwith what we find if we actually examine and describe mathematics and\nmathematical activity. \u201cI should like to be able to\ndescribe\u201d, says Wittgenstein (RFM IV, \u00a713),\n\u201chow it comes about that mathematics appears to us now as the\nnatural history of the domain of numbers, now again as a collection of\nrules\u201d.\n\nWittgenstein, however, does not endeavour to refute\nPlatonism. His aim, instead, is to clarify what Platonism is and what\nit says, implicitly and explicitly (including variants of Platonism\nthat claim, e.g., that if a proposition is provable in an\naxiom system, then there already exists a path [i.e., a proof] from\nthe axioms to that proposition (RFM I, \u00a721; Marion 1998:\n13\u201314, 226; Steiner 2000:\n334). Platonism is either \u201ca mere truism\u201d (LFM\n239), Wittgenstein says, or it is a \u2018picture\u2019 consisting\nof \u201can infinity of shadowy worlds\u201d (LFM 145),\nwhich, as such, lacks \u2018utility\u2019 (cf. PI\n\u00a7254) because it explains nothing and it misleads at every\nturn.\n3.2 Wittgenstein\u2019s Later Finitistic Constructivism\n\nThough commentators and critics do not agree as to whether the later\nWittgenstein is still a finitist and whether, if he is, his finitism\nis as radical as his intermediate rejection of unbounded mathematical\nquantification (Maddy 1986: 300\u2013301, 310), the overwhelming\nevidence indicates that the later Wittgenstein still rejects the\nactual infinite (RFM V, \u00a721; Zettel \u00a7274,\n1947) and infinite mathematical extensions.\n\nThe first, and perhaps most definitive, indication that the later\nWittgenstein maintains his finitism is his continued and consistent\ninsistence that irrational numbers are rules for constructing finite\nexpansions, not infinite mathematical extensions. \u201cThe\nconcepts of infinite decimals in mathematical propositions are not\nconcepts of series\u201d, says Wittgenstein (RFM V,\n\u00a719), \u201cbut of the unlimited technique of expansion of\nseries\u201d. We are misled by \u201c[t]he extensional definitions\nof functions, of real numbers etc\u201d. (RFM V, \u00a735),\nbut once we recognize the Dedekind cut as \u201can extensional\nimage\u201d, we see that we are not \u201cled to\n\\(\\sqrt{2}\\) by way of the concept of a cut\u201d (RFM V,\n\u00a734). On the later Wittgenstein\u2019s account, there simply is\nno property, no rule, no systematic means\nof defining each and every irrational number intensionally,\nwhich means there is no criterion \u201cfor the irrational\nnumbers being complete\u201d (PR \u00a7181).\n\nAs in his intermediate position, the later Wittgenstein claims that\n\u2018\\(\\aleph_0\\)\u2019 and \u201cinfinite series\u201d get their\nmathematical uses from the use of \u2018infinity\u2019 in ordinary\nlanguage (RFM II, \u00a760). Although, in ordinary language,\nwe often use \u2018infinite\u2019 and \u201cinfinitely many\u201d\nas answers to the question \u201chow many?\u201d, and though we\nassociate infinity with the enormously large, the principal\nuse we make of \u2018infinite\u2019 and\n\u2018infinity\u2019 is to speak of the unlimited\n(RFM V, \u00a714) and unlimited techniques\n(RFM II, \u00a745; PI \u00a7218). This fact is\nbrought out by the fact \u201cthat the technique of learning\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) numerals is different from the technique of learning\n100,000 numerals\u201d (LFM 31). When we say, e.g., that\n\u201cthere are an infinite number of even numbers\u201d we mean\nthat we have a mathematical technique or rule for generating even\nnumbers which is limitless, which is markedly different from\na limited technique or rule for generating a finite number of numbers,\nsuch as 1\u2013100,000,000. \u201cWe learn an endless\ntechnique\u201d, says Wittgenstein (RFM V, \u00a719),\n\u201cbut what is in question here is not some gigantic\nextension\u201d.\n\nAn infinite sequence, for example, is not a gigantic extension because\nit is not an extension, and \u2018\\(\\aleph_0\\)\u2019 is not a\ncardinal number, for \u201chow is this picture connected with the\ncalculus\u201d, given that \u201cits connexion is not that\nof the picture | | | | with 4\u201d (i.e., given that\n\u2018\\(\\aleph_0\\)\u2019 is not connected to a (finite) extension)?\nThis shows, says Wittgenstein (RFM II, \u00a758), that we\nought to avoid the word \u2018infinite\u2019 in mathematics wherever\nit seems to give a meaning to the calculus, rather than acquiring its\nmeaning from the calculus and its use in the calculus. Once we see\nthat the calculus contains nothing infinite, we should not be\n\u2018disappointed\u2019 (RFM II, \u00a760), but simply\nnote (RFM II, \u00a759) that it is not \u201creally\nnecessary\u2026 to conjure up the picture of the infinite (of the\nenormously big)\u201d.\n\nA second strong indication that the later Wittgenstein maintains his\nfinitism is his continued and consistent treatment of\n\u2018propositions\u2019 of the type \u201cThere are three\nconsecutive 7s in the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\)\u201d (hereafter\n \u2018PIC\u2019).[4]\n In the middle period, PIC (and its putative negation, \\(\\neg\\)PIC,\nnamely, \u201cIt is not the case that there are three consecutive 7s\nin the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\)\u201d) is not a\nmeaningful mathematical \u201cstatement at all\u201d (WVC\n81\u201382: note 1). On Wittgenstein\u2019s intermediate view,\nPIC\u2014like FLT, GC, and the Fundamental Theorem of\nAlgebra\u2014is not a mathematical proposition because we do\nnot have in hand an applicable decision procedure by which we can\ndecide it in a particular calculus. For this reason, we can only\nmeaningfully state finitistic propositions regarding the\nexpansion of \\(\\pi\\), such as \u201cThere exist three consecutive 7s\nin the first 10,000 places of the expansion of \\(\\pi\\)\u201d\n(WVC 71; 81\u201382, note 1).\n\nThe later Wittgenstein maintains this position in various passages in\nRFM (Bernays 1959: 11\u201312). For example, to someone who says that since \u201cthe\nrule of expansion determine[\\(s\\)] the series\ncompletely\u201d, \u201cit must implicitly determine all\nquestions about the structure of the series\u201d, Wittgenstein\nreplies: \u201cHere you are thinking of finite series\u201d\n(RFM V, \u00a711). If PIC were a mathematical\nquestion (or problem)\u2014if it were finitistically\nrestricted\u2014it would be algorithmically decidable, which it is\nnot (RFM V, \u00a721; LFM 31\u201332, 111, 170;\nWVC 102\u201303). As Wittgenstein says at (RFM V,\n\u00a79): \u201cThe question\u2026 changes its status, when it\nbecomes decidable\u201d, \u201c[f]or a connexion is made then, which\nformerly was not there\u201d. And if, moreover, one invokes\nthe Law of the Excluded Middle to establish that PIC is a mathematical\nproposition\u2014i.e., by saying that one of these \u201ctwo\npictures\u2026 must correspond to the fact\u201d (RFM V,\n\u00a710)\u2014one simply begs the question (RFM V,\n\u00a712), for if we have doubts about the mathematical status of PIC,\nwe will not be swayed by a person who asserts \u201cPIC \\(\\vee\n\\neg\\)PIC\u201d (RFM VII, \u00a741; V, \u00a713).\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s finitism, constructivism, and conception of\nmathematical decidability are interestingly connected at (RFM\nVII, \u00a741, par. 2\u20135).\n\n\nWhat harm is done e.g. by saying that God knows all\nirrational numbers? Or: that they are already there, even though we\nonly know certain of them? Why are these pictures not harmless?\n\nFor one thing, they hide certain problems.\u2014 (MS 124: 139; March\n16, 1944)\n\nSuppose that people go on and on calculating the expansion of \\(\\pi\\).\nSo God, who knows everything, knows whether they will have reached\n\u2018777\u2019 by the end of the world. But can his\nomniscience decide whether they would have reached\nit after the end of the world? It cannot. I want to say: Even God can\ndetermine something mathematical only by mathematics. Even for him the\nmere rule of expansion cannot decide anything that it does not decide\nfor us.\n\nWe might put it like this: if the rule for the expansion has been\ngiven us, a calculation can tell us that there is a\n\u20182\u2019 at the fifth place. Could God have known this, without\nthe calculation, purely from the rule of expansion? I want to say: No.\n(MS 124, pp. 175\u2013176; March 23\u201324, 1944)\n\n\nWhat Wittgenstein means here is that God\u2019s omniscience\nmight, by calculation, find that \u2018777\u2019 occurs at\nthe interval [\\(n,n+2\\)], but, on the other hand, God might go on\ncalculating forever without \u2018777\u2019 ever turning up. Since\n\\(\\pi\\) is not a completed infinite extension that can be\ncompletely surveyed by an omniscient being (i.e., it is not a fact\nthat can be known by an omniscient mind), even God has only the rule,\nand so God\u2019s omniscience is no advantage in this case\n(LFM 103\u201304; cf. Weyl 1921 [1998: 97]). Like us, with\nour modest minds, an omniscient mind (i.e., God) can only calculate\nthe expansion of \\(\\pi\\) to some \\(n\\)th decimal\nplace\u2014where our \\(n\\) is minute and God\u2019s \\(n\\) is\n(relatively) enormous\u2014and at no \\(n\\)th decimal place\ncould any mind rightly conclude that because\n\u2018777\u2019 has not turned up, it, therefore, will never turn\nup.\n3.3 The Later Wittgenstein on Decidability and Algorithmic Decidability\n\nOn one fairly standard interpretation, the later Wittgenstein says\nthat \u201ctrue in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d is identical to\n\u201cprovable in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d and, therefore, that a\nmathematical proposition of calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) is a concatenation of\nsigns that is either provable (in principle) or refutable (in\nprinciple) in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) (Goodstein 1972: 279, 282; Anderson\n1958: 487; Klenk 1976: 13; Frascolla 1994: 59). On this\ninterpretation, the later Wittgenstein precludes undecidable\nmathematical propositions, but he allows that some undecided\nexpressions are propositions of a calculus because they are\ndecidable in principle (i.e., in the absence of a known, applicable\ndecision procedure).\n\nThere is considerable evidence, however, that the later Wittgenstein\nmaintains his intermediate position that an expression is a meaningful\nmathematical proposition only within a given calculus and\niff we knowingly have in hand an applicable and effective\ndecision procedure by means of which we can decide it. For example,\nthough Wittgenstein vacillates between \u201cprovable in PM\u201d\nand \u201cproved in PM\u201d at (RFM App. III, \u00a76,\n\u00a78), he does so in order to use the former to consider the\nalleged conclusion of G\u00f6del\u2019s proof (i.e., that there exist\ntrue but unprovable mathematical propositions), which he then rebuts\nwith his own identification of \u201ctrue in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d with \u201cproved in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d (i.e., not with \u201cprovable in\ncalculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d) (Wang 1991: 253; Rodych 1999a: 177). This\nconstrual is corroborated by numerous passages in which Wittgenstein\nrejects the received view that a provable but unproved\nproposition is true, as he does when he asserts that (RFM\nIII, \u00a731, 1939) a proof \u201cmakes new connexions\u201d,\n\u201c[i]t does not establish that they are there\u201d because\n\u201cthey do not exist until it makes them\u201d, and when he says\n(RFM VII, \u00a710, 1941) that \u201c[a] new proof gives the\nproposition a place in a new system\u201d. Furthermore, as we have\njust seen, Wittgenstein rejects PIC as a non-proposition on the\ngrounds that it is not algorithmically decidable, while admitting\nfinitistic versions of PIC because they are algorithmically\ndecidable.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling evidence that the later Wittgenstein\nmaintains algorithmic decidability as his criterion for a mathematical\nproposition lies in the fact that, at (RFM V, \u00a79, 1942),\nhe says in two distinct ways that a mathematical\n\u2018question\u2019 can become decidable and that when\nthis happens, a new connexion is \u2018made\u2019\nwhich previously did not exist. Indeed, Wittgenstein cautions us\nagainst appearances by saying that \u201cit looks as if a\nground for the decision were already there\u201d, when, in fact,\n\u201cit has yet to be invented\u201d. These passages strongly\nmilitate against the claim that the later Wittgenstein grants that\nproposition \\(\\phi\\) is decidable in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) iff it is\nprovable or refutable in principle. Moreover, if Wittgenstein\nheld this position, he would claim, contra (RFM V,\n\u00a79), that a question or proposition does not become\ndecidable since it simply (always) is decidable. If it is\nprovable, and we simply don\u2019t yet know this to be the case,\nthere already is a connection between, say, our axioms and\nrules and the proposition in question. What Wittgenstein says,\nhowever, is that the modalities provable and\nrefutable are shadowy forms of reality\u2014that possibility\nis not actuality in mathematics (PR \u00a7\u00a7141, 144,\n172; PG 281, 283, 299, 371, 466, 469; LFM 139).\nThus, the later Wittgenstein agrees with the intermediate Wittgenstein\nthat the only sense in which an undecided mathematical\nproposition (RFM VII, \u00a740, 1944) can be\ndecidable is in the sense that we know how to decide\nit by means of an applicable decision procedure.\n3.4 Wittgenstein\u2019s Later Critique of Set Theory: Non-Enumerability vs. Non-Denumerability\n\nLargely a product of his anti-foundationalism and his\ncriticism of the extension-intension conflation, Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlater critique of set theory is highly consonant with his intermediate\ncritique (PR \u00a7\u00a7109, 168; PG 334, 369, 469;\nLFM 172, 224, 229; and RFM III, \u00a743, 46, 85,\n90; VII, \u00a716). Given that mathematics is a \u201cMOTLEY of\ntechniques of proof\u201d (RFM III, \u00a746), it does not\nrequire a foundation (RFM VII, \u00a716) and it cannot be\ngiven a self-evident foundation (PR \u00a7160;\nWVC 34 & 62; RFM IV, \u00a73). Since set theory\nwas invented to provide mathematics with a foundation, it is,\nminimally, unnecessary.\n\nEven if set theory is unnecessary, it still might constitute a solid\nfoundation for mathematics. In his core criticism of set theory,\nhowever, the later Wittgenstein denies this, saying that the diagonal\nproof does not prove non-denumerability, for \u201c[i]t means nothing\nto say: \u2018Therefore the X numbers are not\ndenumerable\u2019\u201d (RFM II, \u00a710). When the diagonal is\nconstrued as a proof of greater and lesser infinite sets it\nis a \u201cpuffed-up proof\u201d, which, as Poincar\u00e9 argued\n(1913: 61\u201362), purports to prove or show more than \u201cits\nmeans allow it\u201d (RFM II, \u00a721).\n\n\nIf it were said: Consideration of the diagonal procedure shews you that the\nconcept \u2018real number\u2019 has much less analogy with\nthe concept \u2018cardinal number\u2019 than we, being misled by\ncertain analogies, are inclined to believe, that would have a good and honest sense. But just the\nopposite happens: one pretends to compare the\n\u2018set\u2019 of real numbers in magnitude with that of cardinal\nnumbers. The difference in kind between the two conceptions is\nrepresented, by a skew form of expression, as difference of extension.\nI believe, and hope, that a future generation will laugh at this hocus\npocus. (RFM II, \u00a722)\n\nThe sickness of a time is cured by an alteration in the mode of life\nof human beings\u2026 (RFM II, \u00a723)\n\n\nThe \u201chocus pocus\u201d of the diagonal proof rests, as always\nfor Wittgenstein, on a conflation of extension and intension, on the\nfailure to properly distinguish sets as rules for generating\nextensions and (finite) extensions. By way of this confusion \u201ca\ndifference in kind\u201d (i.e., unlimited rule vs. finite extension)\n\u201cis represented by a skew form of expression\u201d, namely as a\ndifference in the cardinality of two infinite\nextensions. Not only can the diagonal not prove that one\ninfinite set is greater in cardinality than another infinite set,\naccording to Wittgenstein, nothing could prove this, simply\nbecause \u201cinfinite sets\u201d are not extensions, and\nhence not infinite extensions. But instead of interpreting\nCantor\u2019s diagonal proof honestly, we take the proof to\n\u201cshow there are numbers bigger than the infinite\u201d, which\n\u201csets the whole mind in a whirl, and gives the pleasant feeling\nof paradox\u201d (LFM 16\u201317)\u2014a \u201cgiddiness\nattacks us when we think of certain theorems in set\ntheory\u201d\u2014\u201cwhen we are performing a piece of logical\nsleight-of-hand\u201d (PI \u00a7412; \u00a7426; 1945). This\ngiddiness and pleasant feeling of paradox, says Wittgenstein\n(LFM 16), \u201cmay be the chief reason [set theory] was\ninvented\u201d.\n\nThough Cantor\u2019s diagonal is not a proof of\nnon-denumerability, when it is expressed in a constructive\nmanner, as Wittgenstein himself expresses it at (RFM II,\n\u00a71), \u201cit gives sense to the mathematical proposition that\nthe number so-and-so is different from all those of the system\u201d\n(RFM II, \u00a729). That is, the proof proves\nnon-enumerability: it proves that for any given\ndefinite real number concept (e.g., recursive real), one\ncannot enumerate \u2018all\u2019 such numbers because one can always\nconstruct a diagonal number, which falls under the same concept and is\nnot in the enumeration. \u201cOne might say\u201d, Wittgenstein\nsays, \n\n\nI call number-concept X non-denumerable if it has been stipulated\nthat, whatever numbers falling under this concept you arrange in a\nseries, the diagonal number of this series is also to fall under that\nconcept. (RFM II, \u00a710; cf. II, \u00a7\u00a730, 31,\n13)\n\n\nOne lesson to be learned from this, according to Wittgenstein\n(RFM II, \u00a733), is that \u201cthere are diverse\nsystems of irrational points to be found in the number\nline\u201d, each of which can be given by a recursive rule, but\n\u201cno system of irrational numbers\u201d, and \u201calso no\nsuper-system, no \u2018set of irrational numbers\u2019 of\nhigher-order infinity\u201d. Cantor has shown that we can construct\n\u201cinfinitely many\u201d diverse systems of irrational numbers,\nbut we cannot construct an exhaustive system of all\nthe irrational numbers (RFM II, \u00a729). As Wittgenstein\nsays at (MS 121, 71r; Dec. 27, 1938), three pages after the passage\nused for (RFM II, \u00a757): \n\n\nIf you now call the Cantorian procedure one for producing a new real\nnumber, you will now no longer be inclined to speak of a system of\nall real numbers. (italics added) \n\n\nFrom Cantor\u2019s proof, however, set theorists erroneously conclude\nthat \u201cthe set of irrational numbers\u201d is greater in\nmultiplicity than any enumeration of irrationals (or the set of\nrationals), when the only conclusion to draw is that there is no such\nthing as the set of all the irrational numbers. The\ntruly dangerous aspect to \u2018propositions\u2019 such as\n\u201cThe real numbers cannot be arranged in a series\u201d and\n\u201cThe set\u2026 is not denumerable\u201d is that they make\nconcept formation [i.e., our invention] \u201clook like a\nfact of nature\u201d (i.e., something we discover)\n(RFM II \u00a7\u00a716, 37). At best, we have a vague idea of\nthe concept of \u201creal number\u201d, but only if we restrict this\nidea to \u201crecursive real number\u201d and only if we recognize\nthat having the concept does not mean having a set\nof all recursive real numbers.\n3.5 Extra-Mathematical Application as a Necessary Condition of Mathematical Meaningfulness\n\nThe principal and most significant change from the middle to later\nwritings on mathematics is Wittgenstein\u2019s (re-)introduction of\nan extra-mathematical application criterion, which is used to\ndistinguish mere \u201csign-games\u201d from mathematical\nlanguage-games. \u201c[I]t is essential to mathematics that its signs\nare also employed in mufti\u201d, Wittgenstein states, for\n\n\n\n[i]t is the use outside mathematics, and so the meaning\n[Bedeutung] of the signs, that makes the\nsign-game into mathematics. (i.e., a mathematical\n\u201clanguage-game\u201d; RFM V, \u00a72, 1942;\nLFM 140\u2013141, 169\u201370) \n\n\nAs Wittgenstein says at (RFM V, \u00a741, 1943), \n\n\n[c]oncepts which occur in \u2018necessary\u2019 propositions\nmust also occur and have a meaning\n[Bedeutung] in non-necessary ones. (italics\nadded) \n\n\nIf two proofs prove the same proposition, says Wittgenstein, this\nmeans that \u201cboth demonstrate it as a suitable instrument for the\nsame purpose\u201d, which \u201cis an allusion to something\noutside mathematics\u201d (RFM VII, \u00a710, 1941;\nitalics added).\n\nAs we have seen, this criterion was present in the Tractatus\n(6.211), but noticeably absent in the middle period. The reason for\nthis absence is probably that the intermediate Wittgenstein wanted to\nstress that in mathematics everything is syntax and nothing is\nmeaning. Hence, in his criticisms of Hilbert\u2019s\n\u2018contentual\u2019 mathematics (Hilbert 1925) and\nBrouwer\u2019s reliance upon intuition to determine the meaningful\ncontent of (especially undecidable) mathematical propositions,\nWittgenstein couched his finitistic constructivism in strong\nformalism, emphasizing that a mathematical calculus does not need an\nextra-mathematical application (PR \u00a7109; WVC\n105).\n\nThere seem to be two reasons why the later Wittgenstein reintroduces\nextra-mathematical application as a necessary condition of a\nmathematical language-game. First, the later Wittgenstein has\nan even greater interest in the use of natural and formal\nlanguages in diverse \u201cforms of life\u201d (PI\n\u00a723), which prompts him to emphasize that, in many cases, a\nmathematical \u2018proposition\u2019 functions as if it were an\nempirical proposition \u201chardened into a rule\u201d (RFM\nVI, \u00a723) and that mathematics plays diverse applied roles in many\nforms of human activity (e.g., science, technology, predictions).\nSecond, the extra-mathematical application criterion relieves the\ntension between Wittgenstein\u2019s intermediate critique of set\ntheory and his strong formalism according to which \u201cone calculus\nis as good as another\u201d (PG 334). By demarcating\nmathematical language-games from non-mathematical sign-games,\nWittgenstein can now claim that, \u201cfor the time being\u201d, set\ntheory is merely a formal sign-game. \n\n\nThese considerations may lead us to say that \\(2^{\\aleph_0} \\gt\n\\aleph_0\\).\n\nThat is to say: we can make the considerations lead us to\nthat.\n\nOr: we can say this and give this as our reason.\n\nBut if we do say it\u2014what are we to do next? In what practice is\nthis proposition anchored? It is for the time being a piece of\nmathematical architecture which hangs in the air, and looks as if it\nwere, let us say, an architrave, but not supported by anything and\nsupporting nothing. (RFM II, \u00a735)\n\n\nIt is not that Wittgenstein\u2019s later criticisms of set theory\nchange, it is, rather, that once we see that set theory has no\nextra-mathematical application, we will focus on its calculations,\nproofs, and prose and \u201csubject the interest of the\ncalculations to a test\u201d (RFM II, \u00a762). By\nmeans of Wittgenstein\u2019s \u201cimmensely\nimportant\u201d \u2018investigation\u2019 (LFM 103), we\nwill find, Wittgenstein expects, that set theory is uninteresting\n(e.g., that the non-enumerability of \u201cthe reals\u201d is\nuninteresting and useless) and that our entire interest in it lies in\nthe \u2018charm\u2019 of the mistaken prose interpretation of its\nproofs (LFM 16). More importantly, though there is \u201ca\nsolid core to all [its] glistening concept-formations\u201d\n(RFM V, \u00a716), once we see it as \u201cas a mistake of\nideas\u201d, we will see that propositions such as\n\u201c\\(2^{\\aleph_0} \\gt \\aleph_0\\)\u201d are not anchored in an\nextra-mathematical practice, that \u201cCantor\u2019s\nparadise\u201d \u201cis not a paradise\u201d, and we will\nthen leave \u201cof [our] own accord\u201d (LFM\n103).\n\nIt must be emphasized, however, that the later Wittgenstein still\nmaintains that the operations within a mathematical calculus are\npurely formal, syntactical operations governed by rules of syntax\n(i.e., the solid core of formalism).\n\n\nIt is of course clear that the mathematician, in so far as he really\nis \u2018playing a game\u2019\u2026[is] acting in\naccordance with certain rules. (RFM V, \u00a71)\n\nTo say mathematics is a game is supposed to mean: in proving, we need\nnever appeal to the meaning [Bedeutung] of the\nsigns, that is to their extra-mathematical application. (RFM\nV, \u00a74)\n\n\nWhere, during the middle period, Wittgenstein speaks of\n\u201carithmetic [as] a kind of geometry\u201d at (PR\n\u00a7109 & \u00a7111), the later Wittgenstein similarly speaks of\n\u201cthe geometry of proofs\u201d (RFM I, App. III,\n\u00a714), the \u201cgeometrical cogency\u201d of proofs\n(RFM III, \u00a743), and a \u201cgeometrical\napplication\u201d according to which the \u201ctransformation of\nsigns\u201d in accordance with \u201ctransformation-rules\u201d\n(RFM VI, \u00a72, 1941) shows that \u201cwhen mathematics is\ndivested of all content, it would remain that certain signs can be\nconstructed from others according to certain rules\u201d\n(RFM III, \u00a738). Hence, the question whether a\nconcatenation of signs is a proposition of a given\nmathematical calculus (i.e., a calculus with an\nextra-mathematical application) is still an internal, syntactical\nquestion, which we can answer with knowledge of the proofs and\ndecision procedures of the calculus.\n3.6 Wittgenstein on G\u00f6del and Undecidable Mathematical Propositions\n\nRFM is perhaps most (in)famous for Wittgenstein\u2019s\n(RFM App. III) treatment of \u201ctrue but unprovable\u201d\nmathematical propositions. Early reviewers said that \u201c[t]he\narguments are wild\u201d (Kreisel 1958: 153), that the passages\n\u201con G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem\u2026 are of poor quality or\ncontain definite errors\u201d (Dummett 1959: 324), and that\n(RFM App. III) \u201cthrows no light on G\u00f6del\u2019s\nwork\u201d (Goodstein 1957: 551). \u201cWittgenstein seems to want\nto legislate [[q]uestions about completeness] out of\nexistence\u201d, Anderson said, (1958: 486\u201387) when, in fact,\nhe certainly cannot dispose of G\u00f6del\u2019s demonstrations\n\u201cby confusing truth with provability\u201d. Additionally,\nBernays, Anderson (1958: 486), and Kreisel (1958: 153\u201354)\nclaimed that Wittgenstein failed to appreciate\n\u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s quite explicit premiss of the consistency of\nthe considered formal system\u201d (Bernays 1959: 15), thereby\nfailing to appreciate the conditional nature of G\u00f6del\u2019s\nFirst Incompleteness Theorem. On the reading of these four early\nexpert reviewers, Wittgenstein failed to understand G\u00f6del\u2019s\nTheorem because he failed to understand the mechanics of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s proof and he erroneously thought he could refute or\nundermine G\u00f6del\u2019s proof simply by identifying \u201ctrue\nin PM\u201d (i.e., Principia Mathematica) with\n\u201cproved/provable in PM\u201d.\n\nInterestingly, we now have two pieces of evidence (Kreisel 1998: 119;\nRodych 2003: 282, 307) that Wittgenstein wrote (RFM App. III)\nin 1937\u201338 after reading only the informal,\n\u2018casual\u2019 (MS 126, 126\u2013127; Dec. 13, 1942)\nintroduction of (G\u00f6del 1931) and that, therefore, his use of a\nself-referential proposition as the \u201ctrue but unprovable\nproposition\u201d may be based on G\u00f6del\u2019s introductory,\ninformal statements, namely that \u201cthe undecidable proposition\n[\\(R(q);q\\)] states\u2026 that [\\(R(q);q\\)] is not provable\u201d\n(1931: 598) and that \u201c[\\(R(q);q\\)] says about itself that it is\nnot provable\u201d (1931: 599). Perplexingly, only two of the four\nfamous reviewers even mentioned Wittgenstein\u2019s (RFM\nVII, \u00a7\u00a719, 21\u201322, 1941)) explicit remarks on\n\u2018G\u00f6del\u2019s\u2019 First Incompleteness Theorem (Bernays\n1959: 2; Anderson 1958: 487), which, though flawed, capture the\nnumber-theoretic nature of the G\u00f6delian proposition and\nthe functioning of G\u00f6del-numbering, probably because Wittgenstein\nhad by then read or skimmed the body of G\u00f6del\u2019s 1931 paper.\n\nThe first thing to note, therefore, about (RFM App. III) is\nthat Wittgenstein mistakenly thinks\u2014again, perhaps because\nWittgenstein had read only G\u00f6del\u2019s Introduction\u2014(a)\nthat G\u00f6del proves that there are true but unprovable propositions\nof PM (when, in fact, G\u00f6del syntactically proves that if\nPM is \\(\\omega\\)-consistent, the G\u00f6delian proposition is\nundecidable in PM) and (b) that G\u00f6del\u2019s proof uses\na self-referential proposition to semantically show that there are\ntrue but unprovable propositions of PM.\n\nFor this reason, Wittgenstein has two main aims in (RFM App.\nIII): (1) to refute or undermine, on its own terms, the\nalleged G\u00f6del proof of true but unprovable propositions of\nPM, and (2) to show that, on his own terms, where \u201ctrue\nin calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d is identified with\n\u201cproved in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d, the very idea of\na true but unprovable proposition of calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) is\nmeaningless.\n\nThus, at (RFM App. III, \u00a78) (hereafter simply\n\u2018\u00a78\u2019), Wittgenstein begins his presentation of what\nhe takes to be G\u00f6del\u2019s proof by having someone say: \n\n\nI have constructed a proposition (I will use \u2018P\u2019 to\ndesignate it) in Russell\u2019s symbolism, and by means of certain\ndefinitions and transformations it can be so interpreted that it says:\n\u2018P is not provable in Russell\u2019s system\u2019. \n\n\nThat is, Wittgenstein\u2019s G\u00f6delian constructs a proposition\nthat is semantically self-referential and which specifically\nsays of itself that it is not provable in PM. With this\nerroneous, self-referential proposition P [used also at\n(\u00a710), (\u00a711), (\u00a717), (\u00a718)], Wittgenstein presents\na proof-sketch very similar to G\u00f6del\u2019s own\ninformal semantic proof \u2018sketch\u2019 in the\nIntroduction of his famous paper (1931: 598).\n\n\nMust I not say that this proposition on the one hand is true, and on\nthe other hand is unprovable? For suppose it were false; then it is\ntrue that it is provable. And that surely cannot be! And if it is\nproved, then it is proved that it is not provable. Thus it can only be\ntrue, but unprovable. (\u00a78)\n\n\nThe reasoning here is a double reductio. Assume (a) that\nP must either be true or false in Russell\u2019s system, and (b)\nthat P must either be provable or unprovable in Russell\u2019s\nsystem. If (a), P must be true, for if we suppose that\nP is false, since P says of itself that it is unprovable,\n\u201cit is true that it is provable\u201d, and if it is provable,\nit must be true (which is a contradiction), and hence, given what\nP means or says, it is true that P is unprovable (which is a\ncontradiction). Second, if (b), P must be unprovable, for if P\n\u201cis proved, then it is proved that it is not provable\u201d,\nwhich is a contradiction (i.e., P is provable and not\nprovable in PM). It follows that P \u201ccan only be\ntrue, but unprovable\u201d.\n\nTo refute or undermine this \u2018proof\u2019, Wittgenstein says\nthat if you have proved \\(\\neg P\\), you have proved that P is\nprovable (i.e., since you have proved that it is not the case\nthat P is not provable in Russell\u2019s system), and \u201cyou\nwill now presumably give up the interpretation that it is\nunprovable\u201d (i.e., \u2018P is not provable in\nRussell\u2019s system\u2019), since the contradiction is only proved\nif we use or retain this self-referential interpretation (\u00a78). On\nthe other hand, Wittgenstein argues (\u00a78), \u2018[i]f you assume\nthat the proposition is provable in Russell\u2019s system, that means\nit is true in the Russell sense, and the interpretation\n\u201cP is not provable\u201d again has to be given up\u2019,\nbecause, once again, it is only the self-referential interpretation\nthat engenders a contradiction. Thus, Wittgenstein\u2019s\n\u2018refutation\u2019 of \u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s proof\u201d\nconsists in showing that no contradiction arises if we do not\ninterpret \u2018P\u2019 as \u2018P is not provable in\nRussell\u2019s system\u2019\u2014indeed, without this\ninterpretation, a proof of P does not yield a proof of \\(\\neg P\\)\nand a proof of \\(\\neg P\\) does not yield a proof of P. In other\nwords, the mistake in the proof is the mistaken assumption that a\nmathematical proposition \u2018P\u2019 \u201ccan be so\ninterpreted that it says: \u2018P is not provable in\nRussell\u2019s system\u2019\u201d. As Wittgenstein says at\n(\u00a711), \u201c[t]hat is what comes of making up such\nsentences\u201d.\n\nThis \u2018refutation\u2019 of \u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s\nproof\u201d is perfectly consistent with Wittgenstein\u2019s\nsyntactical conception of mathematics (i.e., wherein mathematical\npropositions have no meaning and hence cannot have the\n\u2018requisite\u2019 self-referential meaning) and with what he\nsays before and after (\u00a78), where his main aim is to show (2)\nthat, on his own terms, since \u201ctrue in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d is identical with \u201cproved in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d, the very idea of a true but unprovable proposition\nof calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) is a contradiction-in-terms.\n\nTo show (2), Wittgenstein begins by asking (\u00a75), what he takes to\nbe, the central question, namely, \u201cAre there true propositions\nin Russell\u2019s system, which cannot be proved in his\nsystem?\u201d. To address this question, he asks \u201cWhat is\ncalled a true proposition in Russell\u2019s system\u2026?\u201d,\nwhich he succinctly answers (\u00a76): \u201c\u2018p\u2019\nis true = p\u201d. Wittgenstein then clarifies this answer\nby reformulating the second question of (\u00a75) as \u201cUnder what\ncircumstances is a proposition asserted in Russell\u2019s game [i.e.,\nsystem]?\u201d, which he then answers by saying: \u201cthe answer\nis: at the end of one of his proofs, or as a \u2018fundamental\nlaw\u2019 (Pp.)\u201d (\u00a76). This, in a nutshell, is\nWittgenstein\u2019s conception of \u201cmathematical truth\u201d: a\ntrue proposition of PM is an axiom or a proved proposition,\nwhich means that \u201ctrue in PM\u201d is identical with,\nand therefore can be supplanted by, \u201cproved in\nPM\u201d.\n\nHaving explicated, to his satisfaction at least, the only real,\nnon-illusory notion of \u201ctrue in PM\u201d, Wittgenstein\nanswers the (\u00a78) question \u201cMust I not say that this\nproposition\u2026 is true, and\u2026 unprovable?\u201d\nnegatively by (re)stating his own (\u00a7\u00a75\u20136)\nconception of \u201ctrue in PM\u201d as\n\u201cproved/provable in PM\u201d: \n\n\n\u2018True in Russell\u2019s system\u2019 means, as was said:\nproved in Russell\u2019s system; and \u2018false in Russell\u2019s\nsystem\u2019 means: the opposite has been proved in Russell\u2019s\nsystem. \n\n\nThis answer is given in a slightly different way at (\u00a77) where\nWittgenstein asks \u201cmay there not be true propositions which are\nwritten in this [Russell\u2019s] symbolism, but are not provable in\nRussell\u2019s system?\u201d, and then answers \u201c\u2018True\npropositions\u2019, hence propositions which are true in\nanother system, i.e. can rightly be asserted in another\ngame\u201d. In light of what he says in (\u00a7\u00a75, 6, and 8),\nWittgenstein\u2019s (\u00a77) point is that if a proposition is\n\u2018written\u2019 in \u201cRussell\u2019s symbolism\u201d and\nit is true, it must be proved/provable in another system,\nsince that is what \u201cmathematical truth\u201d is. Analogously\n(\u00a78), \u201cif the proposition is supposed to be false in some\nother than the Russell sense, then it does not contradict this for it\nto be proved in Russell\u2019s sense\u201d, for \u201c[w]hat is\ncalled \u2018losing\u2019 in chess may constitute winning in another\ngame\u201d. This textual evidence certainly suggests, as Anderson\nalmost said, that Wittgenstein rejects a true but unprovable\nmathematical proposition as a contradiction-in-terms on the grounds\nthat \u201ctrue in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d means nothing more (and\nnothing less) than \u201cproved in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d.\n\nOn this (natural) interpretation of (RFM App. III), the early\nreviewers\u2019 conclusion that Wittgenstein fails to understand the\nmechanics of G\u00f6del\u2019s argument seems reasonable. First,\nWittgenstein erroneously thinks that G\u00f6del\u2019s proof is\nessentially semantical and that it uses and requires a\nself-referential proposition. Second, Wittgenstein says (\u00a714)\nthat \u201c[a] contradiction is unusable\u201d for \u201ca\nprediction\u201d that \u201cthat such-and-such construction is\nimpossible\u201d (i.e., that P is unprovable in PM),\nwhich, superficially at least, seems to\nindicate that Wittgenstein fails to appreciate the \u201cconsistency\nassumption\u201d of G\u00f6del\u2019s proof (Kreisel, Bernays,\nAnderson).\n\nIf, in fact, Wittgenstein did not read and/or failed to understand\nG\u00f6del\u2019s proof through at least 1941, how would he have\nresponded if and when he understood it as (at least) a proof of the\nundecidability of P in PM on the assumption of\nPM\u2019s consistency? Given his syntactical conception of\nmathematics, even with the extra-mathematical application criterion,\nhe would simply say that P, qua expression syntactically\nindependent of PM, is not a proposition of PM, and\nif it is syntactically independent of all existent mathematical\nlanguage-games, it is not a mathematical proposition. Moreover, there\nseem to be no compelling non-semantical reasons\u2014either\nintra-systemic or extra-mathematical\u2014for Wittgenstein to\naccommodate P by including it in PM or by adopting a\nnon-syntactical conception of mathematical truth (such as Tarski-truth\n(Steiner 2000)). Indeed, Wittgenstein questions the intra-systemic and\nextra-mathematical usability of P in various discussions\nof G\u00f6del in the Nachlass and, at\n(\u00a719), he emphatically says that one cannot \u201cmake the truth\nof the assertion [\u2018P\u2019 or \u2018Therefore\nP\u2019] plausible to me, since you can make no use of it except\nto do these bits of legerdemain\u201d.\n\nAfter the initial, scathing reviews of RFM, very little\nattention was paid to Wittgenstein\u2019s (RFM App. III and\nRFM VII, \u00a7\u00a721\u201322) discussions of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s First Incompleteness Theorem (Klenk 1976: 13) until\nShanker\u2019s sympathetic (1988b). In the last 22 years, however,\ncommentators and critics have offered various interpretations of\nWittgenstein\u2019s remarks on G\u00f6del, some being largely\nsympathetic (Floyd 1995, 2001) and others offering a more mixed\nappraisal (Rodych 1999a, 2002, 2003; Steiner 2001; Priest 2004; Berto\n2009a). Recently, and perhaps most interestingly, Floyd & Putnam\n(2000) and Steiner (2001) have evoked new and interesting discussions\nof Wittgenstein\u2019s ruminations on undecidability, mathematical\ntruth, and G\u00f6del\u2019s First Incompleteness Theorem (Rodych\n2003, 2006; Bays 2004; Sayward 2005; and Floyd & Putnam 2006).\n4. The Impact of Philosophy of Mathematics on Mathematics\n\nThough it is doubtful that all commentators will agree (Wrigley 1977:\n51; Baker & Hacker 1985: 345; Floyd 1991: 145, 143; 1995: 376;\n2005: 80; Maddy 1993: 55; Steiner 1996: 202\u2013204), the following\npassage seems to capture Wittgenstein\u2019s attitude to the\nPhilosophy of Mathematics and, in large part, the way in which he\nviewed his own work on mathematics.\n\n\nWhat will distinguish the mathematicians of the future from those of\ntoday will really be a greater sensitivity, and that\nwill\u2014as it were\u2014prune mathematics; since people will then\nbe more intent on absolute clarity than on the discovery of new\ngames.\n\nPhilosophical clarity will have the same effect on the growth of\nmathematics as sunlight has on the growth of potato shoots. (In a dark\ncellar they grow yards long.)\n\nA mathematician is bound to be horrified by my mathematical comments,\nsince he has always been trained to avoid indulging in thoughts and\ndoubts of the kind I develop. He has learned to regard them as\nsomething contemptible and\u2026 he has acquired a revulsion from\nthem as infantile. That is to say, I trot out all the problems that a\nchild learning arithmetic, etc., finds difficult, the problems that\neducation represses without solving. I say to those repressed doubts:\nyou are quite correct, go on asking, demand clarification!\n(PG 381, 1932)\n\n\nIn his middle and later periods, Wittgenstein believes he is providing\nphilosophical clarity on aspects and parts of mathematics, on\nmathematical conceptions, and on philosophical conceptions of\nmathematics. Lacking such clarity and not aiming for absolute clarity,\nmathematicians construct new games, sometimes because of a\nmisconception of the meaning of their mathematical\npropositions and mathematical terms. Education and especially advanced\neducation in mathematics does not encourage clarity but rather\nrepresses it\u2014questions that deserve answers are either not asked\nor are dismissed. Mathematicians of the future, however, will be more\nsensitive and this will (repeatedly) prune mathematical extensions and\ninventions, since mathematicians will come to recognize that new\nextensions and creations (e.g., propositions of transfinite cardinal\narithmetic) are not well-connected with the solid core of mathematics\nor with real-world applications. Philosophical clarity will,\neventually, enable mathematicians and philosophers to \u201cget down\nto brass tacks\u201d (PG 467).",
