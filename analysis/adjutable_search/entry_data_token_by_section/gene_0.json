    "main_text": "A History of the Gene Within the History of Genetics || From Mendel\u2019s methods to Mendelism\n1.1 From Mendel\u2019s methods to Mendelism\n\nThe question of biological heredity emerged in the nineteenth century\nin diverse fields of practice and gave rise to various theories, which\noften aimed to provide a unified view of heredity, development, and\nevolution (M\u00fcller-Wille & Rheinberger 2012: Chs. 2\u20135).\nGregor Mendel (1822\u20131884) did not aim at a unifying theory, nor\ndid he set out to discover laws governing heredity. Historians have\nargued, instead, that he was concerned with specific questions\nregarding the role of hybridization in evolution (Olby 1979; cf.\nM\u00fcller-Wille 2018). Other hybridists had crossed plants of\ndifferent species and varieties, studied their offspring, and asked\nwhether new species could emerge in this process. Issues regarding the\nclassification of hybrids emerged: how did hybrids resulting from\ncrosses between pure species differ from offspring of parent organisms\nthat were hybrids themselves; and how could their characteristics be\ninterpreted with respect to those of their parents when it came to\ndetermining their type? Mendel (1866 [2016]) aimed to address such\nquestions in his experiments with garden peas and in this respect was\nindeed indebted to his predecessors. Nonetheless, he introduced\nseveral changes in the experimental system employed by the hybridists\nthat allowed him to arrive at more specific results regarding the\ndistribution of types in several generations of offspring\n(M\u00fcller-Wille & Orel 2007). First, he concentrated on\nvarieties that differed only in one or a few characteristics. This\nenabled him to move from classifying the offspring according to type\nto a focus on the distribution of traits that characterized the types.\nSecond, he made sure that he obtained offspring in numbers that\nallowed for a statistical treatment of the distribution of characters.\nIn this way, he was able to observe regularities in the appearance of\ntypes in the third generation (plants resulting from crosses between\nhybrids) that previous hybridists where not able to detect. Finally,\nhe developed a notation system where letters represented types of germ\ncells, which he used to record his results and compare them with\ntheoretical predictions. These innovations enabled Mendel to arrive at\na set of regularities regarding\n\nthe uniform appearance of a \u201cdominant\u201d character in\nthe first generation,\nthe segregation of the dominant and alternative,\n\u201crecessive\u201d characters in a ratio 3:1 in the second\ngeneration, representing one pure dominant, two hybrids, showing the\ndominant character, and one pure recessive, and\nthe independent inheritance of separate character pairs.\n\n\nMendel\u2019s refined methodology was the basis for important\nconceptual innovations. Next to the shift from \u201cforms\u201d or\n\u201ctypes\u201d found in several generations in hybridization\nexperiments to the distribution of characters, Mendel could move from\nthe characterization of the contribution of gametes (also addressed as\n\u201cfactors\u201d) to the \u201celements\u201d by which the\ngametes differed (M\u00fcller-Wille & Orel 2007). Nonetheless,\nMendel did not think of the regularities as laws of heredity. Indeed,\nwhether they were valid for organisms other than the garden pea he\nconsidered subject to empirical investigation. Furthermore, Mendel\nthought of his results as illuminating the behavior of characters in\nhybrids, i.e., he did not generalize his results to heredity per\nse, as it would occur in the reproduction of all characters, also\nin pure varieties (Rheinberger & M\u00fcller-Wille 2018: Ch.\n3).\n\nIn 1900, several botanists independently arrived at similar results in\ntheir hybridization experiments and at the same time took notice of\nMendel\u2019s original work and stated its significance in their\nrespective publications (Olby 1966: Ch. 6). This brought the Mendelian\napproach and way of reasoning to the attention of those who worked\nwith experimental crosses in contexts of either theoretical questions\nregarding heredity and evolution or applied problems of horticulture\nand scientific breeding (Bowler 1989a: Ch. 6). Much had changed in\nbiology since Mendel\u2019s days: first, the idea that the hereditary\nmaterial is passed on independently of somatic development, codified\nin August Weismann\u2019s (1834\u20131914) germ-line theory, was\nwell established; second, several researchers had developed a\ncytological interpretation of hereditary phenomena; third, in the late\nnineteenth century various ideas on how to identify units transmitted\nthrough germ cells had emerged. Furthermore, on a broader social and\neconomic scale, processes of industrialization and rationalization of\nfood production, vaccines, and other applications had led to an\nincreased demand for standardized biological materials\n(M\u00fcller-Wille & Rheinberger 2012: Ch. 6). In this context,\nthe entities and regularities identified by hybridization experiments\nwere now taken to be the basis of heredity in general.\n\nThe early \u201cMendelians\u201d employed and expanded\nMendel\u2019s experimental system, notation, and terminology (Shan\n2020). They codified Mendel\u2019s regularities as \u201claws\u201d\nof heredity, while at the same time investigating exceptions to\nuniformity or dominance (e.g., \u201cblending\u201d characters), to\nthe ratios of segregation (e.g., due to \u201ccomposite\u201d\ncharacters, which came to be seen as influenced by several factors),\nand to independent assortment in crosses involving several characters\n(e.g., because characters appeared to be \u201ccoupled\u201d).\nMendel\u2019s experiments, perceived as exemplars for the study of\nvariation and heredity, named \u201cgenetics\u201d by William\nBateson (1861\u20131926; 1907), played an important role for the\nformation of both the field and its central concept, the gene. Bateson\nemphasized the idea that discrete \u201cunit-characters\u201d could\nbe identified in organisms, which occurred in alternative forms or\n\u201callelomorphs\u201d. In crosses these characters segregated in\nMendelian ratios. This indicated and was explained by assuming the\n\u201cpurity of gametes\u201d, i.e., the fact that reproductive\ncells can transmit only one form of a character. When two gametes that\nwere alike with respect to one character united, the resulting zygote\nwas \u201chomozygous\u201d for this character, otherwise it was\n\u201cheterozygous\u201d. While these observations were initially\ndiscussed mainly in terms of characters and types of gametes or the\ngametes\u2019 ability to transmit characters, Bateson came to think\nof the dominant allelomorph as being determined by some\n\u201cfactor\u201d present in the gamete, while the recessive\ncharacter resulted when the factor was absent in both gametes (Darden\n1991: Ch. 6; Schwartz 2002). \u201cFactor\u201d thus came to be\nused\u00a0by many Mendelians similarly to Mendel\u2019s\n\u201celements\u201d. The term referred to whatever made two gametes\ndifferent regarding the inheritance of characters, but it was not\nconnected to any specific theory regarding the physical nature of the\nhereditary material.\n\nThere were also alternatives to the Mendelian view of heredity. The\nbiometric approach, going back to the work of Francis Galton\n(1822\u20131911) and further developed by W.F.R. Weldon\n(1860\u20131906) and Karl Pearson (1857\u20131936), used advanced\nstatistical tools to investigate heredity in terms of correlations\nbetween characters in successive generations in limited populations\n(Porter 1986: Ch. 9). Weldon and Pearson adhered to an orthodox\ninterpretation of Charles Darwin\u2019s (1809\u20131882) view that\nevolution proceeded by natural selection acting on gradual variation.\nMendelians, instead, focused on discontinuous variation (Bowler 1992;\nGayon 1998). Wilhelm Johannsen (1857\u20131927) had conducted\nexperiments with \u201cpure lines\u201d, in which he selected the\nplus or minus variants of quantitative characters such as seed size in\nthe offspring of self-fertilized beans (Johannsen 1903). Based on his\nresults, Johannsen distinguished between fluctuating variation, which\nwas due to contingent influences of the environment, and variation\nbetween types, which remained stable unless changed in a discontinuous\nmanner through mutation (Roll-Hansen 2009). Around that time, Hugo de\nVries (1848\u20131935; 1901\u20131903) suggested the concept of\nmutation to account for the spontaneous emergence of new stable types.\nEven though many did not follow de Vries\u2019 idea of large-scale\nchanges affecting several characters at once, giving rise to a new\nspecies instantaneously, most Mendelians came to think that the\ncharacter variation they observed occurred spontaneously through\nchanges in factors as units of the hereditary material (Bowler 1992:\nCh. 8).\n\nInitially, some Mendelians doubted the purity of gametes and concluded\nthat the maternal and paternal gametes \u201ccontaminated\u201d each\nother regarding the factors by which they differed, thus allowing for\ncontinuous variation. However, various researchers were able to\nresolve the question by showing how several factors affected the same\nquantitatively characterized character in cumulative manner (Carlson\n1966: Chs. 4\u20135; Darden 1991: Chs. 6\u20137). Around 1910,\nmodels of \u201cmulti-factorial inheritance\u201d explained modes of\ninheritance of continuously varying characters based on discontinuous\ngenetic variation. These and other developments led to a convergence\nof biometric approaches and Mendelism and the emergence of\nmathematical population genetics in the 1920s and 30s, a field that\nlaid the foundations for genetic models of the effects of selection\nand other processes of evolution (Allen 1978: Ch. V, Part II; Bowler\n1989b: Ch. 11; Provine 1971; entries on\n population genetics\n and\n ecological genetics).\n",
