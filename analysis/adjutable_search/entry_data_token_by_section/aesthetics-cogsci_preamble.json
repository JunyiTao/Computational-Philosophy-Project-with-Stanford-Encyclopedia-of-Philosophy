    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry concerns the ways in which work in cognitive science,\nbroadly conceived, is or may be of importance for work in\nphilosophical aesthetics. Our focus is largely on analytic, primarily\nAnglophone, aesthetic writing and its ancestry in the empirical\ntradition. Aesthetic work occurs elsewhere, inside philosophy and\nbeyond, but it is within the analytic tradition that connections with\nthe sciences of mind have been most investigated, and it is that\ntradition which has been most receptive to empirical theories and\nresults (the work of Merleau-Ponty in the phenomenological tradition\nis an exception; for his influence see, e.g., Solli & Netland\n2021).\n\nCognitive science spans the disciplines of psychology, linguistics,\nneuroscience and philosophy, and its relatively brief history has been\ndominated by the idea that human information processing depends on\ninner representations which are subject to computation (Boden 2006).\nIt now encompasses approaches which challenge this idea, seeking to\nreplace or augment inner representation with dependence on the\nenvironment. This concern with human cognitive architecture is\nexemplified in such developments as Marr\u2019s theory of vision\n(1982), Brooks\u2019 subsumption architecture for robots (1986), and\npredictive processing theories of perception and cognition (Friston\n2010, see also below,\n Section 3).\n A survey of this large domain must be very selective and we have\ntried to identify, for each topic, a small number of key ideas on\nwhich to build our discussion. Throughout we have focused on sources\nthat highlight the issues that confront us when we try to decide when\nsome contribution from the empirical sciences of mind provides a\nrethink of some aesthetic doctrine, when the two disciplines offer\ncomplementary perspectives, and when the one is of no particular\nrelevance to the other.\n",
