Howson, for example, argues that\n\u201cInductive reasoning is justified to the extent that it is\nsound, given appropriate premises\u201d (Howson 2000: 239, his\nemphasis). According to this view, there is no getting away from an\nempirical premise for inductive inferences, but we might still think\nof Bayesian conditioning as functioning like a kind of logic or\n\u201cconsistency constraint\u201d which \u201cgenerates\npredictions from the assumptions and observations together\u201d\n(Romeijn 2004: 360). Once we have an empirical assumption,\ninstantiated in the prior probability, and the observations, Bayesian\nconditioning tells us what the resulting predictive probability\ndistribution should be.\n\nThe idea of a partial solution also arises in the context of the\nlearning theory that grounds contemporary machine learning. Machine\nlearning is a field in computer science concerned with algorithms that\nlearn from experience. Examples are algorithms which can be trained to\nrecognise or classify patterns in data. Learning theory concerns\nitself with finding mathematical theorems which guarantee the\nperformance of algorithms which are in practical use. In this domain,\nthere is a well-known finding that learning algorithms are only\neffective if they have \u2018inductive bias\u2019 \u2014 that is, if\nthey make some a priori assumptions about the domain they are employed\nupon (Mitchell 1997).\n\nThe idea is also given formal expression in the so-called\n\u2018No-Free-Lunch theorems\u2019 (Wolpert 1992, 1996, 1997). These\ncan be interpreted as versions of the argument in Hume\u2019s first\nfork since they establish that there can be no contradiction in the\nalgorithm not performing well, since there are a priori\npossible situations in which it does not (Sterkenburg and\nGr\u00fcnwald 2021:9992). Given Hume\u2019s premise\n P3,\n this rules out a demonstrative argument for its good performance.\n\nPremise\n P3\n can perhaps be challenged on the grounds that a priori\njustifications can also be given for contingent propositions. Even\nthough an inductive inference can fail in some possible situations, it\ncould still be reasonable to form an expectation of reliability if we\nspread our credence equally over all the possibilities and have reason\nto think (or at least no reason to doubt) that the cases where\ninductive inference is unreliable require a \u2018very specific\narrangement of things\u2019 and thus form a small fraction of the\ntotal space of possibilities (White 2015). The No-Free-Lunch theorems\nmake difficulties for this approach since they show that if we put a\nuniform distribution over all logically possible sequences of future\nevents, any learning algorithm is expected to have a generalisation\nerror of 1/2, and hence to do no better than guessing at random\n(Schurz 2021b).\n\nThe No-Free-Lunch theorems may be seen as fundamental limitations on\njustifying learning algorithms when these algorithms are seen as\n\u2018purely data-driven\u2019 \u2014 that is as mappings from possible\ndata to conclusions. However, learning algorithms may also be\nconceived as functions not only of input data, but also of a\nparticular model (Sterkenburg and Gr\u00fcnwald 2021). For example,\nthe Bayesian \u2018algorithm\u2019 gives a universal recipe for\ntaking a particular model and prior and updating on the data. A number\nof theorems in learning theory provide general guarantees for the\nperformance of such recipes. For instance, there are theorems which\nguarantee convergence of the Bayesian algorithm (Ghosal, Ghosh and van\nder Vaart 2000, Ghosal, Lember and van der Vaart 2008). In each\ninstantiation, this convergence is relative to a particular specific\nprior. Thus, although the considerations first raised by Hume, and\nlater instantiated in the No-Free-Lunch theorems, preclude any\nuniversal model-independent justification for learning algorithms, it\ndoes not rule out partial justifications in the form of such general a\npriori \u2018model-relative\u2019 learning guarantees (Sterkenburg\nand Gr\u00fcnwald 2021).\n",
