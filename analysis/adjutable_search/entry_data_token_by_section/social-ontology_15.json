    "main_text": "How Social Categories and Kinds Are Set Up || Theories of Practice\n4.4 Theories of Practice\n\nA different large class of theories hold that practical engagement\nwith the environment is the basis for the setup of social categories.\nMany of these theories are influenced by Heidegger 1927, Merleau-Ponty\n1945, and Wittgenstein 1953. And still other theories are pluralistic\nand heterogeneous: they hold that social categories are not just set\nup in one uniform way, but in a variety of distinct ways.\n\nTheories of practice were discussed in\n section 3.2.4,\n as theories of the constituents or parts of social phenomena. Dances,\nfor instance, involve physical and mental routines: among the\nconstituents of a cha-cha are people\u2019s thoughts and actions on\nthe dance floor. However, theories of practice are not so easily\ncategorized. Particular tokens of dance routines might be understood\nas playing a dual role: not only are they the constituents of\ncha-chas, but they also are among the sources of the category cha-cha.\nIn this respect, theories of practice share an insight with certain\n\u201cpattern\u201d theories (see sections\n 4.3.2\n and\n 4.3.3):\n the tokens of the practices themselves do some of the work in\nstructuring the social categories into which the practices fall.\nGiddens (1984) gives an account of what he calls\n\u201cstructuration\u201d, the process by which social structures\nare dynamically generated by practices and also condition them.\nSahlins (1981, 1985) describes the formation of cultural categories\nthrough collisions between cultures and the actions of individuals.\nOther theories as well, such as Foucault (1976, 1977a) and Geertz (1973) can also be\nunderstood as giving accounts of how practices set up social\ncategories.\n\nBecause practices are so general and play so many roles in these\ntheories, it is a challenge to interpret them from the perspective of\nsocial ontology. It is hard to tease apart different kinds of\nontological claims they make, and also hard even to know when these\ntheories are making an ontological claim, as opposed merely to telling\na narrative of causal influence. Some theories of practice insist on\nthe importance of material routines in the world, and yet return to\nmentalistic-sounding accounts of the conceptual creation of the social\nworld. The centerpiece of Bourdieu 1972 [1977], for instance, is the\nclaim that social practice is generated by a\n\u201chabitus\u201d\u2014a mentally internalized system of\ndiscrimination and perception, embodied as dispositions.
