    "main_text": "Diachronic Dutch Book Arguments || Conditionalization\n4.1 Conditionalization\n\nThe Rule of Conditionalization is commonly endorsed for updating\nprobabilities in response to new information.  It states\nthat an agent with the probability function \\(\\pr_1\\) at time \\(t_1\\)\nwho learns \\(E\\) and nothing stronger at time \\(t_2\\)\nshould obtain her new probability function \\(\\pr_2\\) from her old\nprobability function by conditionalizing on \\(E\\), i.e.\nfor each proposition \\(A\\), \\(\\pr_2(A) = \\pr_1(A\\mid\nE)\\), where the\nconditional probability\n\\(\\pr(A\\mid E)\\) is given in terms of the ratio formula: \\(\\pr(A\\mid E) = \\pr(A\n\\& E)/\\pr(E)\\).  There\nis a Dutch Book (strategy) argument purporting to show that an agent\nought to change beliefs by conditionalization, which was constructed\nby Lewis (1999), but was first reported by Teller (1973).  If an\nagent violates this rule by adjusting her probabilities such that\n\\(\\pr_2(A) \\lt \\pr_1(A\\mid E)\\), a bookie can inflict a sure loss by\nfirst selling the agent the following three bets:\n\n\n\n(Bet 1)\nfor \\(\\pr_1(A\\wedge E)\\): \n\n \n\\($1\\)\nif \\(A \\wedge E\\) \n\n\u00a0\n\\($0\\)\notherwise  \n\n\n\n\n(Bet 2)\nfor \\(\\pr_1(A\\mid E)\\pr_1(\\neg E)\\): \n\n\u00a0\n\\($\\pr_1(A\\mid E)\\)\nif \\(\\neg E\\) \n\n\u00a0\n\\($0\\)\notherwise  \n\n\n\n\n(Bet 3)\nfor \\([\\pr_1(A\\mid E) - \\pr_2(A)]\\cdot\n\\pr_1(E)\\): \n\n\u00a0\n\\($\\pr_1(A\\mid E) - \\pr_2(A)\\)\nif \\(E\\) \n\n\u00a0\n\\($0\\)\notherwise  \n\n\nIf \\(E\\) is false, the agent has a net loss of\n[\\(\\pr_{1}(A\\mid E) -\\) \\(\\pr_{2}(A)\\)] \\(\\pr_{1}(E)\\). If \\(E\\)\nis true, then the bookie buys back a fourth bet:\n\n\n\n(Bet 4)\nfor \\(\\pr_2(A)\\): \n\n\u00a0\n\\($1\\)\nif \\(A\\) \n\n\u00a0\n\\($0\\)\notherwise  \n\n\nBets 1 and 2 together amount to a conditional bet on \\(A\\),\nwhich is called off if \\(E\\) is\nfalse. In the event that \\(E\\) is true, this bet is\nbought back at the lower price of \\(\\pr_{2}(A)\\). Bet 3 spreads the\nexpected winnings of that exchange in order to assure a profit in the\ncase that \\(E\\) is false. Thus, if \\(E\\)\nis true the agent suffers a net loss of [ \\(\\pr_{1}(A\\mid E) -\n\\pr_{2}(A)\\)] \\(\\pr_{1}(E)\\). If \\(\\pr_{2}(A) \\gt \\pr_{1}(A\\mid E)\\),\nthen the strategy involves reversing the direction of the above bets.\nWhere dollars are taken as measures of utility, each bet is fair given\nthe agent\u2019s beliefs at the time offered.  There is also a\nconverse Dutch Book theorem that shows that adhering to\nconditionalization avoids Dutch Book vulnerability Skyrms\n(1987b).\n\nWhile\nthe argument has often been cited\nin support of the Rule of Conditionalization as characterized above,\nthere are significant assumptions and limitations to Lewis\u2019\nDutch Strategy argument in defense of the claim that rational updating\nrequires conditionalization on the evidence in accordance with the\nrule.  As\nvan Fraassen points out, the Dutch Strategy given above does\nnot yield an argument for the diachronic Principle of\nConditionalization as stated (van Fraassen 1989). There is no strategy\nfor the bookie that guarantees him a profit from an agent for whom\n\\(\\pr_{2}(A) \\ne \\pr_{1}(A\\mid E)\\) unless the agent makes a\ncommitment to violate the rule in a particular way in advance. The\nidea that the above bets constitute a betting strategy yielding a\nDutch Book tacitly assumes that the agent\u2019s alternative rule \\(D\\)\nis fixed at time \\(t_{1}\\), before it is known\nwhether or not \\(E\\) is true, and that the agent is\nsure to follow the rule if \\(E\\) is learned.\n\nHowever, the bookie can guarantee himself a profit in some cases even\nif it is not assumed that the agent will follow though by placing a\nside bet that he wins in the event that the agent does not change\nbeliefs as planned. The Dutch Strategy depends upon the fact that the\nagent initially has some definite probability that he will shift\nprobabilities in the event that \\(E\\), in some\nparticular way that is not the result of conditionalization on \\(E\\).\nThe Dutch Strategy argument in no way establishes\nthat one must have such a probability, and so at most shows that one\nshould not have a plan involving a fixed probability to update upon\nlearning \\(E\\) in a way that differs from\nconditionalizing on \\(E\\).\n\nEven where it is assumed that an agent is fully committed to following\nthrough on some alternative to the Rule of Condtionalization, there\nare questions about what the Dutch Strategy shows. As with the basic\nDBA for probabilism, it is possible to devise scenarios in which it\nwould be rational to leave oneself open to a Dutch Strategy by\nannouncing a deviant updating rule, and so the Dutch Strategy argument\nshould not be taken to show that it is strictly irrational to have an\nupdating rule other than Conditionalization. Rather, the existence of\nthe strategy points to a tension in adopting such a rule. Shifting\nfrom \\(\\pr_{1}\\) to \\(\\pr_{2}\\) by conditionalizing on \\(E\\)\nis equivalent to invariance, i.e. for each\nproposition \\(A\\), \\(\\pr_{1}(A\\mid E) =\\)\n\\(\\pr_{2}(A\\mid E)\\). Adopting a rule for updating other than\nConditionalization is thus tantamount to holding at time \\(t_{1}\\)\nthat for some \\(A\\), \\(\\pr_{1}(A\\mid E) \\ne\\)\n\\(\\pr_{2}(A\\mid E)\\). Note that the bookie simply takes advantage of\nthe difference between the agent\u2019s probability for A given \\(E\\)\nat \\(t_{1}\\) and at \\(t_{2}\\). Where the agent is\ncertain at \\(t_{1}\\) that he would update via some deviant rule \\(D\\),\nthe rule induces a conditional probability at that\ntime for \\(A\\) given \\(E\\) that differs\nfrom \\(\\pr_{1}(A\\mid E)\\). In such a case, \\(\\pr_{2}(A\\mid E)\\) is\nfixed at \\(t_{1}\\) by the agent\u2019s credal state, and so given\nthat \\(\\pr_{1}(A\\mid E) \\ne\\) \\(\\pr_{2}(A\\mid E)\\), the agent\u2019s\ncredences may be said to exhibit a kind of inconsistency. While this\nis problematic in a way that the sort of inconsistency involved\nin simply having different levels of confidence for a proposition at\ndifferent times is not, it appears less like inconsistency for full\nbelief than failing to obey the probability axioms, where the agent\nhas evaluations according to which each in a set of bets is fair at a\nsingle time. While \\(\\pr_{2}(A\\mid E)\\) may be fixed at \\(t_{1}\\),\nthis is not the agent\u2019s conditional probability at \\(t_{1}\\),\nbut rather the probability for \\(A\\) given \\(E\\)\nthat she will come to have at \\(t_{2}\\) upon learning\n\\(E\\). Such updating plans are part of the\nagent\u2019s credal system though, for which Dutch Book vulnerability\nmay plausibly be held to signal a defect.\n\nThe Dutch Strategy against the non-conditionalizer, as described\nabove, also depends upon the assumption that either E will be learned\nor the altenative not E will be learned.  Otherwise, there is no\nguarantee that a loss can be inflicted, even if, on the condition that\nE is learned, the agent plans to adjust her credences such that\n\\(\\pr_2(A) \u2260\\pr_1(A\\mid E)\\).  More generally, the existence of a\nDutch Strategy assumes a learning scenario in which the agent\u2019s\npossible total evidence is one of a set of propositions \\(\\{E_1, E_2,\n\\ldots, E_n\\}\\) that characterize what can be learned. \n\nGallow (2019) calls attention to the fact that the Rule of\nConditionalization as stated in the form above does not depend upon\nthe possible evidential propositions that may be learned, but only the\nprior credences and what is actually learned.  Constructing a Dutch\nStrategy against a non-conditionalizer requires having a rule that\nspecifies how they will update their credences given the alternative\npossible evidence that they might have learned.  So, at most the Dutch\nStrategy Argument defends the Rule of Conditionalization in an\nappropriate learning scenario that specifies the possible evidence\nthat may be obtained.  Gallow also emphasizes that the propositions in\nthe learning scenario must form a partition, as some presentations\nexplicitly assume.  If they do not, that is some of the \\(E_i\\)\noverlap, he shows that Dutch Strategies are possible against\nconditionalizers. For instance, where \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\)\nare the evidential propositions that may be learned and they overlap,\nlearning either will raise the conditionalizer's credence in their\nconjunction.  A Dutch Strategy can be constructed that takes advantage\nof the difference between the prior credence for the conjunction and\nthe foreseeable rise in the conjunction upon either learning\n\\(E_1\\) or learning \\(E_2\\). Gallow suggests that learning\nscenarios may exist in which the possible evidence fails to form a\npartition, and that evidence can be acquired outside of any learning\nscenario at all.\n\n\nThese\nobservations put significant pressure on the Dutch Strategy argument,\nespecially when the argument is read, as Gallow does, as drawing the\nconclusion that violating the Rule of Conditionalization is\nepistemically irrational on the grounds that doing so involves\nvulnerability to a Dutch Strategy. The Rule of Conditionalization, as\nstated above, says to conditionalize on the evidence E obtained,\nirrespective of the evidence that might have been obtained instead, so\nin particular it counsels conditionalizing both in learning scenarios\nthat form a partition and those that do not. But, as Gallow shows,\nconditionalizing in the latter case can involve vulnerability to a\ndiachronic Dutch Book, so Dutch Strategy vulnerability fails to\ndiscriminate between cases in which the rule, as characterized above,\nis adopted and cases in which it is violated.\n \n\nOne\noption for preserving the force to the Dutch Strategy argument for the\nRule of Conditionalization as given is to insist that ideally\nrational agents will always obtain evidence in a learning scenario\nthat forms a partition, which is a view that Gallow plausibly\nattributes to Lewis (1999). Even if this is right for highly idealized\nepistemic agents, it leaves the status of the Principle of\nConditionalization unclear in more ordinary circumstances and so fails\nto establish the principle as a general norm. Moreover, such a defense\nof conditionalization would depend upon more than just the claim\nthat vulnerability to a Dutch Strategy involves irrationality, but\nalso upon the claim that there are rationality constraints on possible\nlearning scenarios.   \n\nAn alternative is simply to amend the Rule of Conditionalization to\nbuild in that it only applies in learning scenarios that form a\npartition. This would allow for a Dutch Strategy argument for the\nnarrower claim that epistemic rationality requires conditionalizing in\nlearning scenarios that form a partition, provided that the notion of\nepistemic rationality here also makes sense of the Dutch Strategy\nvulnerability of conditionalizers in other learning scenarios. \n\nOne more limitation to observe about Lewis\u2019 Dutch Strategy\nargument for changing credences by Conditionalization stems from his\nformulation of the principle itself in terms of the ratio formula,\nwhich requires that the prior probability of the evidence\nconditionalized on is non-zero.  Rescorla (2019) addresses this by\ngiving a form of conditionalization, which he terms Kolmogorov\nConditionalization, that permits conditionalizing on evidence with\nnull priors. He then proves a Dutch Book theorem and converse for it,\nwhere the theorems involve generalized learning scenarios.  \n",
