    "main_text": "Justice for Bodin: Open and Closed Questions || Open Questions\n6.2 Open Questions\nSome recent studies of the Heptaplomeres have tended to\ncast some doubt on Bodin\u2019s authorship of this work. Even if the issue\nof his authorship has not been decisively resolved, one of the\nsecondary but beneficial consequences of these studies is that they\nhave increased our understanding of the on sources which the author of\nthis anonymous text drew \u2014 including not only\nthe Daemonomania as well as the other works by Bodin, but\nalso the writings of Johan Wier (1515\u20131588; Wier 1579).  The\nmost important studies questioninig Bodin\u2019s authorship of the treatise\nare those by Karl F. Faltenbacher (2002, 2009) and David Wootton\n(2002), Jean C\u00e9ard (2009) and Isabelle Pantin\n(2009). Refutations of this thesis, on the other hand, have been\npublished by Jean Letrouit (1995), Andrea Suggi (2005, 2006, 2007) and\nNoel Malcom (2006).\n",
