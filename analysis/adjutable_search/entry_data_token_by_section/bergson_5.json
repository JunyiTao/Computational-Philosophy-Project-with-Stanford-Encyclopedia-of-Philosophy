    "main_text": "The two sources of morality and religion\n6. The two sources of morality and religion\n\nBergson himself says that his final book, The Two Sources of\nMorality and Religion, develops ideas from Creative\nEvolution. It attempts to show that there are two sources from\nwhich two kinds of morality and religion evolve. As always with\nBergson, Kant is at issue, in this case his moral philosophy. And as\nusual, Bergson starts by differentiating within a mixture. Under the\nword \u201cmorality\u201d or under the phrase \u201cmoral\nobligation,\u201d there is a mixture of two kinds of morality.\n\nThere is the closed morality, whose religion is static, and there is\nthe open morality, whose religion is dynamic. Closed morality and\nstatic religion are concerned with social cohesion. Nature has made\ncertain species evolve in such a way that the individuals in these\nspecies cannot exist on their own. They are fragile and require the\nsupport of a community. One quickly thinks of bees, and Bergson, of\ncourse, refers to them. We can see again that there are bodily needs\nwhich must be satisfied. The force of these needs is the source of the\nclosed morality. Because of these needs, there is a rigidity to the\nrules of closed moralities. Kant\u2019s moral philosophy has its\nsource in such needs. The survival of the community requires that\nthere be strict obedience: the categorical imperative. Yet, although\nKant\u2019s categorical imperative is supposed to be universal, it is\nnot, according to Bergson. It is limited and particular. Closed\nmorality really concerns the survival of a society, my society.\nTherefore, it always excludes other societies. Indeed, for Bergson,\nclosed morality is always concerned with war. And static religion, the\nreligion of closed morality, is based on what Bergson calls the\n\u201cfabulation function.\u201d The fabulation function is a\nparticular function of the imagination that creates \u201cvoluntary\nhallucinations.\u201d The fabulation function takes our sense that\nthere is a presence watching over us and invents images of gods. These\nimages then insure strict obedience to the closed morality. In short,\nthey insure social cohesion.\n\nBut, there is another kind of morality and religion, according to\nBergson. The open morality and dynamic religion are concerned with\ncreativity and progress. They are not concerned with social cohesion,\nand thus Bergson calls this morality \u201copen\u201d because it\nincludes everyone. The open morality is genuinely universal and it\naims at peace. It aims at an \u201copen society.\u201d The source of\nthe open morality is what Bergson calls \u201ccreative\nemotions.\u201d The difference between creative emotions and normal\nemotions consists in this: in normal emotions, we first have a\nrepresentation which causes the feeling (I see my friend and then I\nfeel happy); in creative emotion, we first have the emotion which then\ncreates representations. So, Bergson gives us the example of the joy\nof a musician who, on the basis of emotion, creates a symphony, and\nwho then produces representations of the music in the score. We can\nsee here that Bergson has also finally explained how the leap of an\nintuition happens. The creative emotion makes one unstable and throws\none out of the habitual mode of intelligence, which is directed at\nneeds. Indeed, in The Two Sources, Bergson compares creative\nemotions to unstable mental states as those found in the mad. But what\nhe really has in mind is mystical experience. For Bergson, however,\nmystical experience is not simply a disequilibrium. Genuine mystical\nexperience must result in action; it cannot remain simple\ncontemplation of God. This association of creative emotions with\nmystical experience means that, for Bergson, dynamic religion is\nmystical. Indeed, dynamic religion, because it is always creative,\ncannot be associated with any particular organized set of doctrines. A\nreligion with organized \u2013 and rigid \u2014 doctrines is always\nstatic.\n\nThe phrase with which we began, \u201cmoral obligation,\u201d makes\none think of Kantian duty. We have alluded to Kant on several\noccasions, but, let us conclude by examining Bergson\u2019s explicit\ncriticism of Kant\u2019s moral philosophy. This criticism will\ndemonstrate the strength of Bergson\u2019s moral philosophy and of\nhis thought as a whole. According to Bergson, Kant\u2019s theory has\nmade a \u201cpsychological error.\u201d In any given society, there\nare many different, particular obligations. The individual in society\nmay at some time desire to deviate from one particular obligation.\nWhen this illicit desire arises, there will be resistance from society\nbut also from his habits. If the individual resists these resistances,\na psychological state of tension or contraction occurs. The\nindividual, in other words, experiences the rigidity of the\nobligation. Now, according to Bergson, when philosophers such as Kant\nattribute a severe aspect to duty, they have externalized this\nexperience of obligation\u2019s inflexibility. In fact, for Bergson,\nif we ignore the multiplicity of particular obligations in any given\nsociety, and if instead we look at what he calls \u201cthe whole of\nobligation\u201d (The Two Sources, p. 25), then we see that\nobedience to obligation is almost natural. According to Bergson,\nobligations, that is, customs, arise because of the natural need an\nindividual has for the stability that a society can give. As a result\nof this natural need, society inculcates habits of obedience in the\nindividual. Habituation means that obedience to the whole of\nobligation is, in fact, for the individual, effortless.\n\nThe psychological error then consists in externalizing an exceptional\nexperience \u2013 which Bergson calls \u201cresistance to the\nresistances\u201d \u2013 into a moral theory. Duty becomes severe\nand inflexible. But there is more to this error. Kant believes that he\ncan resolve obligation into rational elements. In the experience of\nresistance to the resistances, the individual has an illicit desire.\nAnd, since the individual is intelligent, the individual uses\nintelligence, a rational method, to act on itself. According to\nBergson, what is happening here is that the rational method is merely\nrestoring the force of the original tendency to obey the whole of\nobligation that society has inculcated in the individual. But as\nBergson notes, the tendency is one thing; the rational method is\nanother. The success of the rational method, however, gives us the\nillusion that the force with which an individual obeys any particular\nobligation comes from reason, that is, from the idea or\nrepresentation, or better still, from the formula of the\nobligation.\n\nBut, there is another force. The second force is what Bergson calls\n\u201cthe impetus of love\u201d (The Two Sources, p. 96).\nThe impetus of love, like joy but also like sympathy, is a creative\nemotion. The emotion must be explicated into actions and\nrepresentations. But, this process of explication can be extended. The\nrepresentations that the mystic explicates can be further explicated\ninto formulas, for example, the formula of each person being deserving\nof respect and dignity. These formulas, which are the expression of\ncreation and love, are now able to be mixed with the formulas that aim\nsolely to insure the stability of any given society. Since we are now\nspeaking only of formulas, creation and cohesion, the two forces, are\nmixed together in reason. As before, whereas the rational method used\nin the experience of resistance to the resistances comes to explain\nthe force of obedience, here in the mystical experience of the impetus\nof love the formulas come to explain the force of creation. A reversal\nhas taken place. The very forces that have generated the formulas are\ninstead now being explained by those very formulas. Indeed, this is\nthe problem. How could some representation of intelligence have the\npower to train the will?\u00a0 How could an idea categorically demand\nits own realization?\u00a0 As Bergson says, \u201cRe-establish the\nduality [of forces], the difficulties vanish\u201d (The Two\nSources, p. 96). The two forces are, however, but two\ncomplementary manifestations of life.\n",
