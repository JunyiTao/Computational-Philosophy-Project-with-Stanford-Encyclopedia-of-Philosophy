    "main_text": "Physical Substance || Vai\u015be\u1e63ika Atomism\n2.2 Vai\u015be\u1e63ika Atomism\n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 10\u201314) repeats the\nconventional Vai\u015be\u1e63ika theory that the first four\nsubstances (earth, water, air, fire) are each of two types, atomic and\ncomposite. An atom (param\u0101\u1e47u) is indestructible\n(anitya), indivisible (i.e. non-composite), and has a special\nkind of dimension, called \u201csmall\u201d (a\u1e47u).\nThe Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas\u2019 standard argument for atomism is as\nfollows. It is an empirically established truth that whatever is\nperceived is composite. Thus even the smallest perceptible thing,\nnamely, a fleck of dust in a sun-beam, has parts, which are therefore\ninvisible. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas call the smallest perceptible\nthing a \u201ctriad\u201d (trya\u1e47uka) and claim that\nit has three parts, each of which is called a \u201cdyad\u201d\n(dya\u1e47uka). Does each of these parts itself have parts?\nYes\u2014for it is another empirically established truth that the\nparts of a visible thing themselves have parts (e.g. a piece of cloth,\nwhose parts, the threads, are themselves composite). The\nVai\u015be\u1e63ikas say that a dyad has two parts, each of which is\nan atom.\n\nThis argument establishes that there are objects too small to be seen,\nbut it does not demonstrate that some of them are non-composite. Why\ncannot the process of sub-division be continued ad infinitum? The\nManual of Reason\u2019s intriguing answer is that if such were\nthe case then Mount Meru and a mustard seed would have the same size,\nas each would have the same (infinite) number of constituent parts! An\nimplicit premise here (articulated by other Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas) is\nthat the size of a whole is a function of the size, number and spatial\narrangement of its parts.\n\nThe argument seems to be question-begging, for the implicit premise is\nonly true if atomism is already accepted. A non-atomist will say that\nthe size of an object is determined, not by its constituents, but by\nthe spatial boundaries of the \u2018stuff\u2019 it is made of.\n",
