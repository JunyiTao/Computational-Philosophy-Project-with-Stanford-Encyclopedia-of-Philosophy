    "main_text": "The (Temporary) Triumph of Anti-Nativism\n6. The (Temporary) Triumph of Anti-Nativism\n\n\nIn terms of the historical contest, Empiricism emerged triumphant,\nand as inevitably happens in such victories, anti-Nativism triumphed\nover Nativism. The doctrine of innate ideas came to\nbe seen as backward and unscientific, as inextricably tied to\ndiscredited metaphysical and theological doctrines, and as therefore\nincompatible with a naturalistic approach to human nature.\nEmpiricism developed very much along Humean lines (and with\nAnaxagoras\u2019 anti-speculative hard-headedness). The\n20th century Logical Positivists and Logical Empiricists\nagreed with Hume that we have no a priori knowledge about the\nintelligible structure of the\n world.[15]\nA priori knowledge is only\npossible in the formal sciences, and this is so only because such\nknowledge is ultimately about the structure of our concepts and/or our\nlanguage. Others, following Quine, have gone a step further and\nfollowed John Stuart Mill\u2019s lead in rejecting all claims to\nknowledge of apriori necessary truths. For Quine, only\nour sensory evidence ultimately warrants the claim that\n 2+2=4.[16]\nOn both\nviews, once we get straight about the true nature and extent of our\nknowledge, Nativism turns out to be an unnecessary extravagance.\n\n\nEven without its 17th century metaphysical and theological\n\u2018baggage\u2019, the Nativist view, and the entire controversy\nsurrounding it, came to be seen as born in conceptual confusion about\nthe proper task of a theory of knowledge. Real philosophical questions\nare about the\nnature of our ideas and about the structure and\njustification of our knowledge. Nativism deflects attention\nfrom these issues, and distracts us with empirical claims about\nthe genesis of ideas and beliefs.  Kantianism, the main\n19th century alternative to the Empiricist project, presses\nmany of these ideas. The modern scientific temperament was influenced\nby both these approaches, and eventually to be identified with\nEmpiricism. We learn about the world only from our perceptual\nencounter with it; nothing is revealed to us beforehand. So innateness\nwas triply condemned: it was born of superstitious religious thinking,\nit is empirically false, and it is philosophically beside the\npoint.\n",
