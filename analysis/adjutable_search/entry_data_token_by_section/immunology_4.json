    "main_text": "Immune Ecology and Evolution\n3. Immune Ecology and Evolution\n\nImmunology\u2019s basic conceptual orientation is undergoing\nexpansion from an individuality-based biology to include communal\necological perspectives. Similar shifts in perspective have also taken\nplace in other fields of biology (Nathan 2014; van Baalen and Huneman\n2014), and thus immunology joins a proliferation of\n\u201csub-organismal\u201d environmental studies that would\nintegrate ecology with developmental biology, physiology, cancer\nbiology, molecular eco-systems, and eco-immunology (S. Gilbert and\nEpel 2015; Karasov, Mart\u00ednez del Rio, and Caviedes-Vidal 2011;\nMaley et al. 2017; Tauber 2017). This emerging perspective is\naccompanied by an increasing interest in somatic evolution occurring\nduring carcinogenesis, neurogenesis, microbiota development, and the\nadaptive immune responses. This shift has led to an abandonment of the\nclassical vision of the immune system directed at defense to now\ninclude tolerant mechanisms that permit assimilation and co-habitation\nthat reflect stabilized microbial-host relationships. In that\nre-orientation, concepts of pathogenicity and individuality have been\nre-defined.\n\nSo, although the concepts of immunity were developed primarily in the\ncontext of disease ecology, attention is shifting to symbiotic\necosystems. The exchanges the immune system mediates highlight context\nsensitivity of parasitism, commensalism and mutualism, and further\ndemonstrates the bidirectional dialogue between bacteria and the host\nin the mutual construction of their respective ecological niches. The\nproblem of immune evolution and clonal selection of lymphocytes is\nconsidered, in turn, to provide the most general account of natural\nselection. An important new issue concerns a set of problems\nassociated with the recently discovered adaptive immune system of\nbacteria, the CRISPR system, whose role in evolution poses novel\nchallenges to basic Darwinian principles (see section 3.2).\n",
