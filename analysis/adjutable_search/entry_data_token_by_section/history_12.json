What is involved in saying that \u201cThe American\nCivil War was caused by economic conflict between the North and the\nSouth\u201d? Does causal ascription require identifying an underlying\ncausal regularity\u2014for example, \u201cperiods of rapid inflation\ncause political instability\u201d? Is causation established by\ndiscovering a set of necessary and sufficient conditions? Can we\nidentify causal connections among historical events by tracing a\nseries of causal mechanisms linking one to the next? This topic raises\nthe related problem of determinism in history: are certain events\ninevitable in the circumstances? Was the fall of the Roman Empire\ninevitable, given the configuration of military and material\ncircumstances prior to the crucial events?\n\nAnalytic philosophers of history most commonly approached these issues\non the basis of a theory of causation drawn from positivist philosophy\nof science. This theory is ultimately grounded in Humean assumptions\nabout causation: that causation is nothing but constant conjunction.\nSo analytic philosophers were drawn to the covering-law model of\nexplanation, because it appeared to provide a basis for asserting\nhistorical causation. As noted above, this approach to causal\nexplanation is fatally flawed in the social sciences, because\nuniversal causal regularities among social phenomena are unavailable.\nSo it is necessary either to arrive at other interpretations of\ncausality or to abandon the language of causality. A second approach\nwas to define causes in terms of a set of causally relevant conditions\nfor the occurrence of the event\u2014for example, necessary and/or\nsufficient conditions, or a set of conditions that enhance or reduce\nthe likelihood of the event. This approach found support in\n\u201cordinary language\u201d philosophy and in analysis of the use\nof causal language in such contexts as the courtroom (Hart and\nHonor\u00e9 1959). Counterfactual reasoning is an important element\nof discovery of a set of necessary and/or sufficient conditions; to\nsay that \\(C\\) was necessary for the occurrence of \\(E\\) requires that\nwe provide evidence that \\(E\\) would not have occurred if \\(C\\) were\nnot present (Mackie 1965, 1974). And it is evident that there are\ncausal circumstances in which no single factor is necessary for the\noccurrence of the effect; the outcome may be overdetermined by\nmultiple independent factors.\n\nThe convergence of reasons and causes in historical processes is\nhelpful in this context, because historical causes are frequently the\neffect of deliberate human action (Davidson 1963). So specifying the\nreason for the action is simultaneously identifying a part of the\ncause of the consequences of the action. It is often justifiable to\nidentify a concrete action as the cause of a particular event (a\ncircumstance that was sufficient in the existing circumstances to\nbring about the outcome), and it is feasible to provide a convincing\ninterpretation of the reasons that led the actor to carry out the\naction.\n\nWhat analytic philosophers of the 1960s did not come to, but what is\ncrucial for current understanding of historical causality, is the\nfeasibility of tracing causal mechanisms through a complex series of\nevents (causal realism). Historical narratives often take the form of\nan account of a series of events, each of which was a causal condition\nor trigger for later events. Subsequent research in the philosophy of\nthe social sciences has provided substantial support for historical\nexplanations that depend on tracing a series of causal mechanisms\n(Little 2018; Hedstr\u00f6m and Swedberg 1998).\n",
