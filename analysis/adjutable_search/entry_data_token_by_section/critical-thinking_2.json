    "main_text": "Examples and Non-Examples || Dewey\u2019s Three Main Examples\n2.1 Dewey\u2019s Three Main Examples\n\nDewey (1910: 68\u201371; 1933: 91\u201394) takes as paradigms of\nreflective thinking three class papers of students in which they\ndescribe their thinking. The examples range from the everyday to the\nscientific.\n\nTransit: \u201cThe other day, when I was down town on 16th\nStreet, a clock caught my eye. I saw that the hands pointed to 12:20.\nThis suggested that I had an engagement at 124th Street, at one\no\u2019clock. I reasoned that as it had taken me an hour to come down on a\nsurface car, I should probably be twenty minutes late if I returned\nthe same way. I might save twenty minutes by a subway express. But was\nthere a station near? If not, I might lose more than twenty minutes in\nlooking for one. Then I thought of the elevated, and I saw there was\nsuch a line within two blocks. But where was the station? If it were\nseveral blocks above or below the street I was on, I should lose time\ninstead of gaining it. My mind went back to the subway express as\nquicker than the elevated; furthermore, I remembered that it went\nnearer than the elevated to the part of 124th Street I wished to\nreach, so that time would be saved at the end of the journey. I\nconcluded in favor of the subway, and reached my destination by one\no\u2019clock.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 68\u201369; 1933: 91\u201392)\n\nFerryboat: \u201cProjecting nearly horizontally from the\nupper deck of the ferryboat on which I daily cross the river is a long\nwhite pole, having a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a flagpole\nwhen I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with\nthis idea, and these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But\nsoon difficulties presented themselves. The pole was nearly\nhorizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the next place,\nthere was no pulley, ring, or cord by which to attach a flag; finally,\nthere were elsewhere on the boat two vertical staffs from which flags\nwere occasionally flown. It seemed probable that the pole was not\nthere for flag-flying.\n\n\u201cI then tried to imagine all possible purposes of the pole, and\nto consider for which of these it was best suited: (a) Possibly it was\nan ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even the tugboats carried\npoles, this hypothesis was rejected. (b) Possibly it was the terminal\nof a wireless telegraph. But the same considerations made this\nimprobable. Besides, the more natural place for such a terminal would\nbe the highest part of the boat, on top of the pilot house. (c) Its\npurpose might be to point out the direction in which the boat is\nmoving.\n\n\u201cIn support of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was\nlower than the pilot house, so that the steersman could easily see it.\nMoreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so that, from the\npilot\u2019s position, it must appear to project far out in front of the\nboat. Moreover, the pilot being near the front of the boat, he would\nneed some such guide as to its direction. Tugboats would also need\npoles for such a purpose. This hypothesis was so much more probable\nthan the others that I accepted it. I formed the conclusion that the\npole was set up for the purpose of showing the pilot the direction in\nwhich the boat pointed, to enable him to steer correctly.\u201d\n(Dewey 1910: 69\u201370; 1933: 92\u201393)\n\nBubbles: \u201cIn washing tumblers in hot soapsuds and\nplacing them mouth downward on a plate, bubbles appeared on the\noutside of the mouth of the tumblers and then went inside. Why? The\npresence of bubbles suggests air, which I note must come from inside\nthe tumbler. I see that the soapy water on the plate prevents escape\nof the air save as it may be caught in bubbles. But why should air\nleave the tumbler? There was no substance entering to force it out. It\nmust have expanded. It expands by increase of heat, or by decrease of\npressure, or both. Could the air have become heated after the tumbler\nwas taken from the hot suds? Clearly not the air that was already\nentangled in the water. If heated air was the cause, cold air must\nhave entered in transferring the tumblers from the suds to the plate.\nI test to see if this supposition is true by taking several more\ntumblers out. Some I shake so as to make sure of entrapping cold air\nin them. Some I take out holding mouth downward in order to prevent\ncold air from entering. Bubbles appear on the outside of every one of\nthe former and on none of the latter. I must be right in my inference.\nAir from the outside must have been expanded by the heat of the\ntumbler, which explains the appearance of the bubbles on the outside.\nBut why do they then go inside? Cold contracts. The tumbler cooled and\nalso the air inside it. Tension was removed, and hence bubbles\nappeared inside. To be sure of this, I test by placing a cup of ice on\nthe tumbler while the bubbles are still forming outside. They soon\nreverse\u201d (Dewey 1910: 70\u201371; 1933: 93\u201394).\n",
