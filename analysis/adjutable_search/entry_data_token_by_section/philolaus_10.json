    "main_text": "Psychology || Psychic Faculties\n5.1 Psychic Faculties\n\nFragment 13 presents Philolaus\u2019 account of psychic faculties:\n\nThe head [is the seat] of intellect, the heart of soul\n(psych\u00ea) and sensation, the navel of rooting and first\ngrowth, the genitals of the sowing of seed and generation. The brain\n[contains] the origin of man, the heart the origin of animals, the\nnavel the origin of plants, the genitals the origin of all (living\nthings). For all things both flourish and grow from seed.\n\n\nPhilolaus thus recognizes four distinct psychic faculties. He makes a\nclear distinction between intellect (nous), which is limited\nto human beings, and perception, which animals possess as well. He has\nno word for the soul as a whole and uses psych\u00ea, which\nserves this function in Plato and Aristotle, for the psychic functions\nshared by humans and animals. Some have argued that for Philolaus\npsych\u00ea only meant \u201clife,\u201d a common use in\nthe fifth century (Burkert 1972, 270). However, since plants are alive\nand psych\u00ea is not assigned to them, \u201clife\u201d\nis not a good translation. Parallels in Herodotus suggest that for\nPhilolaus psych\u00ea was the seat of emotions and desires,\nwhich was closely connected to perception (Huffman 2009). The third\npsychic faculty is responsible for nutrition and growth and the fourth\ngoverns generation and the sowing of seed. This hierarchy of four\nfaculties is strikingly associated with the hierarchy of living beings\n(human, animal, plant) as well as a hierarchy of parts of the body\n(head, heart, navel, genitals). In identifying the head as the seat of\nintellect, Philolaus is siding with his fellow townsman, Alcmaeon,\nagainst those like Empedocles who championed the heart. He goes beyond\nthis controversy to locate each faculty in a part of the body and thus\nanticipates a similar attempt by Plato to assign psychic faculties to\nregions of the body in the Timaeus. Philolaus makes a\nsignificant advance over earlier Presocratics by making a firm\ndistinction between thinking and perception. His systematization of\npsychic faculties goes beyond anything found in his predecessors and\nis the recognizable precursor of Aristotle\u2019s distinction between the\nfaculties for nutrition, appetite, sensation, movement and thought\n(de An. 414a31\u20132).\nRiedweg notes that three of the seats of the psychic faculties (brain,\nheart and genitals) in animals are forbidden to be eaten in the\nacousmata, so that it may be that a connection can be seen\nhere between scientific and religious strands in Pythagoreanism (2005,\n110).\n",
