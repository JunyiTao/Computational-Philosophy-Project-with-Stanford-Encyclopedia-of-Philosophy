    "main_text": "Negation and opposition in natural language || Privation, affixal negation, and the markedness asymmetry\n1.7 Privation, affixal negation, and the markedness asymmetry\n\nFor Aristotle, privation is an instance of opposition defined in terms\nof the absence or presence of a default property for a given\nsubject:\n\n\nWe say that that which is capable of some particular faculty or\npossession has suffered privation [ster\u00easis] when the\nfaculty or possession in question is in no way present in that in\nwhich, and at the time in which, it should be naturally present. We do\nnot call that toothless which has not teeth, or that blind which has\nnot sight, but rather that which has not teeth or sight at the time\nwhen by nature it should. (Categories 12a28\u201333)\n\n\nA newborn kitten, while lacking sight, is thus no more\n\u201cblind\u201d than is a chair, nor is a baby\n\u201ctoothless\u201d.\n\nPrivation as the absence of what would be expected by nature to be\npresent is revisited in the Metaphysics\n(1022b23\u20131023a8), where Aristotle\u2014noting that privation\ncan range over predictable absence, accidental removal, or deliberate\n\u201ctaking away by force\u201d of the relevant\nproperty\u2014distinguishes privation \u201cwith respect to\ngenus\u201d, as in the blindness of moles, from privation \u201cwith\nrespect to self\u201d, as in the blindness or toothlessness of an old\nman. In the end, Aristotle concedes, there may be as many senses of\nprivation as there are a- prefixed terms in Greek\n(Met. 1022b33). Indeed, privation may be reanalyzed as the\nprimary contrariety (1055a34).\n\nIn a wide range of languages, affixal negation on simplex bases\nreflects Aristotelian privation, whence the asymmetry between possible\nforms (unhappy, untrue, unkind) and impossible or unlikely\nones (unsad, unfalse, uncruel). We can describe a failed\ncomedy, but not a successful tragedy, as unfunny. As\nJespersen (1917, 144) observes, the tendency of semi-productive\nnegative affixation to be restricted to unmarked or positive bases\ncombines with that of the preference for contrariety reviewed\nabove:\n\n\nThe modification in sense brought about by the addition of the prefix\nis generally that of a simple negation: unworthy = \u201cnot\nworthy\u201d, etc\u2026 The two terms [X,\nunX] are thus contradictory terms. But very\noften the prefix produces a \u201ccontrary\u201d term or at any rate\nwhat approaches one: unjust generally implies the opposite of\njust; unwise means more than not wise and approaches foolish,\nunhappy is not far from miserable, etc.\n\n\nThe counter-expectation property of affixal negation extends even to\ncontradictory, middle-excluding adjectives like\nalive/dead; nothing can be both and nothing capable\nof being either can be \u201cin between\u201d. But undead\nhas been around since Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula (1897) as\nboth an adjective and a zero-derived occupational noun to describe\nzombies, vampires, and other creatures that are \u201cnot quite dead\nbut not fully alive, dead-and-alive\u201d (OED). Someone or something\nis undead\u2014e.g., a vampire\u2014if it fails to conform to\none\u2019s expectation that it should be dead. But\nif something appears to be alive but does not quite fulfill that\nexpectation, it is not undead but unalive, e.g.,\nartificial flowers. Both the undead (but not quite alive) vampire and\nthe unalive (but not dead) artificial flowers conform to\nAristotle\u2019s notion of a privative opposite in lacking a property\nassociated by default rules with the respective subject.\n\nThe marked status of negative utterances has also been invoked to\nmotivate an asymmetry in the geometry of lexicalization. Within the\nSquare of Opposition, the Aristotelian relations of contradiction,\ncontrariety, and subalternation are supplemented with an additional\nrelation of subcontrariety, so called because the subcontraries are\nlocated under the contraries. As the contradictories of the two\ncontraries, the subcontraries (e.g., Some pleasure is good,\nSome pleasure is not good) can both be true, but cannot both\nbe false. For Aristotle, this was therefore not a true opposition,\nsince subcontraries are \u201cmerely verbally opposed\u201d\n(Prior Analytics 63b21\u201330). In pragmatic terms, the\nassertion of one subcontrary (Some men are bald) is not only\ncompatible with, but actually conversationally implicates, the other\n(Some men are not bald), given Grice\u2019s Maxim of\nQuantity (\u201cMake your contribution as informative as is\nrequired\u201d; see the entries on\n Paul Grice,\n pragmatics, and\n implicature).\n The fact that the two members of a subcontrary pair tend to be\nequipollent or mutually derivable in a given context may explain the\nfact that only one of the two subcontraries will lexicalize in natural\nlanguage, and the markedness of negation explains why this is always\nthe positive (I vertex, e.g., some) rather\nthan the negative (O vertex, e.g., no) value\n(Horn 1989, 2012). Thus the E values none,\nnor, and never are possible but the corresponding\nO values *nall (\u201cnot all\u201d),\n*nand (\u201cor not\u201d), and *nalways\n(\u201cnot always\u201d) are never attested. Similar, if less\nabsolute, asymmetries obtain among non-quantificational and indeed\nnon-logical values (van der Auwera 1996, Horn 2012). Various competing\nexplanations to the pragmatic account of Horn (1989, 2012) have been\nproposed for motivating these asymmetries; see, inter alia, Jaspers\n2005, Seuren and Jaspers 2014, and references therein.\n",
