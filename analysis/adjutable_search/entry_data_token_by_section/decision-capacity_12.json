    "main_text": "Five Widely Accepted Assumptions (And a Sixth, More Controversial One) || All-or-Nothing Assessment (Relative to a Particular Decision)\n5.3 All-or-Nothing Assessment (Relative to a Particular Decision)\n\nA third assumption that pervades contemporary work on decisional\ncapacity is that for practical purposes, a ruling on capacity must be\nall-or-nothing: either the patient in question has decisional capacity\nor she lacks it. Of course, in many contexts there is an obvious sense\nin which we can speak meaningfully of \u201cdegrees\u201d of\ncapacity, for we are indeed measuring abilities that fall along a\nspectrum. However, in practice we need a judgment of a bivalent type.\nThis is because we need to know who has final decision-making\nauthority and there is no such thing as \u201csort of\u201d having\nauthority over a decision. If a patient has the capacity to make\ndecision X, then others must honor her choice even if they disagree\nwith it. But if she lacks capacity to make decision X, someone else, a\nguardian or surrogate will have to decide for her. To avoid\npotentially endless controversy and ensure the smooth operation of the\nhealthcare system, law and practice need a \u201cyes-or-no\u201d\nverdict about whether a person can make a particular decision for\nherself or not (Buchanan & Brock 1989: 27).\n",
