Motor imagery plays a crucial role in action planning and\naction execution, but motor imagery is not mental imagery. But how\nexactly this distinction is to be drawn is subject to debate.\n\nMotor imagery has been traditionally understood as the feeling of\nimagining doing something. It is sometimes taken to be necessarily\nconscious, not just by philosophers (Currie & Ravenscroft 1997),\nsometimes even by psychologists (Jeannerod 1997; see also Brozzo 2017:\nesp. 243\u2013244 for an overview). And as imagining tends to be a\nvoluntary act, motor imagery is also often taken to be voluntary. So\nthe paradigmatic example here is closing your eyes and imagining\nreaching for an apple.\n\nThere are debates, however, about what this traditional,\nphenomenological way of zeroing in on motor imagery as the feeling of\nimagining doing something entails. As it is acknowledged by all\ninvolved in this debate, not all imaginative episodes of doing\nsomething would count as motor imagery: you somehow need to imagine\ndoing something from a first person, and not a third person\nperspective. Marc Jeannerod, one of the most important psychologists\nworking on both motor imagery and mental imagery made a distinction\n(following the practice in sport psychology) between internal (first\nperson) and external (third person) imagery, and only the former would\ncount as motor imagery (the latter would be sensory imagery of me\ndoing something, see Jeannerod 1994, p. 189).\n\nGiven that motor imagery, just like mental imagery, can be conscious\nor unconscious (see, for example, Osuagwu & Vuckovic 2014) and it\ncan also be voluntary or involuntary, there has been a tendency to\nmove away from phenomenological characterization. A more inclusive way\nof understanding motor imagery is supported by the methodological\nadvice by Jeannerod, who writes: \u201cMotor imagery would be related\nto motor physiology in the same way visual imagery is related to\nvisual physiology\u201d (Jeannerod 1994, p. 189). And here a better\nunderstanding of mental imagery can help us with defining motor\nimagery.\n\nMental imagery is the representation that results from perceptual\nprocessing that is not triggered directly by sensory input. So we get\nmental imagery when the first stop of perceptual processing happens\nwithout direct sensory input. Motor imagery is to the output what\nmental imagery is to the input. So we get motor imagery when the last\nstop in action processing happens without directly triggering motor\noutput. In other words, motor imagery is the representation that\nresults from processing in the motor system (in the motor and premotor\ncortices) that does not trigger motor output directly.\n\nAnother open question about the relation between motor imagery and\nmental imagery is about whether the former necessarily involves the\nlatter. When we think of conscious examples of motor imagery, it seems\nthat imagining touching the camera of my laptop involves some form of\nsensory mental imagery (maybe visual imagery of my finger touching the\ncamera, or, maybe, more minimally, proprioceptive mental imagery of my\nfinger being at a different location from where it is now). And\nempirical studies also show that motor imagery necessarily entails\nrepresenting the sensory consequences of the imagined action (Kilteni\net al. 2018).\n",
