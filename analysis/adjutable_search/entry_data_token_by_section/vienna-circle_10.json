Much has been made of the\nvery status of the criterion itself (however it may be put in the\nend): was it empirically testable? It is common to claim that it is\nnot and therefore to consign it to insignificance in turn, following\nPutnam (1981a, 1981b). The question arises whether this is to overlook the fact \nthat the criterion of significance was put forward not as an empirical\nclaim but as a meta-theoretical proposal for how to delimit empiricist\nlanguages from non-empiricist ones. Again, pursuing this line of\ninquiry is not to deny that the meaning\ncriterion may have been understood by some members of the Circle in such a way that it became liable\nto charges of self-refutation. Even if that were the case, the reason\nfor this may be found not in the very idea of such a criterion, but\nin the contradictory status of the Tractarian \u201celucidations\u201d to which\nthe criterion was likened. (The legitimacy of these elucidations was\nat issue already in the debates that divided the Circle in the early\n1930s; see, e.g., Neurath 1932a.) What will be considered here is primarily the view of Carnap, who from 1932 onwards put his\nphilosophical theses in the form of \u201cproposals\u201d for\nalternative language forms, but how the pragmatist alternative fares\nwill also be considered. Finally, we will consider where this does\nleave neopositivist anti-metaphysics.\n\nFor Carnap, the empiricist criterion of significance was an analytic\nprinciple, but in a very special sense. As a convention, the criterion\nhad the standing of an analytic statement, but it was not a formally\nspecifiable framework principle of the language Ln\nto which it pertained. Properly formulated, it was a semantic\nprinciple concerning Ln that was statable only in\nits meta-language Ln+1. To argue that the\ncriterion itself is meaningless because it has no standing in\nLn is to commit a category mistake, for\nmeta-linguistic assertions need not have counterparts in their object\nlanguages (Goldfarb 1997, Creath 2004, Richardson 2004). Nor would it\nbe correct to claim that the criterion hides circular reasoning,\nallegedly because its rejection of the meaningless depends on an\nunquestioned notion of experiential fact as self-explanatory (when\nsuch fact is still to be constituted). Importantly, Carnap\u2019s\nlanguage constructor does not start with fixed notions of what is\nempirical (rather than formal) or what is given (rather than assumed\nor inferred), but from the beginning allows a plurality of\nperspectives on these distinctions (Ricketts 1994). Carnap\u2019s\nempiricist criterion of significance is precisely this: an\nexplication, a proposal for how empiricists may wish to speak. It is\nnot an explanation of how meaning arises from what is not meaningful\nin itself. Unlike theorists who wish to explain how meaning itself is\nconstituted, explicationists can remain untroubled by the regress of\nformal semantics with Tarskian strictures. For them, the lack of\nformal closure (the incompleteness of arithmetic and the\ninapplicability of the truth predicate to its own language) only\nbetokens the fact that our very own home languages cannot ever be\nfully explicated.\n\nIt may be wondered whether such considerations have not become\npointless, given the troubles that attempts to provide a criterion of\nsignificance ran into. However, as we saw, Carnap\u2019s 1956\ncriterion for constructed languages remains in play. Moreover, there\nalso remains the informal, pragmatic approach that can be applied even\nmore widely. Thus it is not without importance to see that pragmatic\nprinciples delineating empirical significance (like Mach\u2019s or\nQuine\u2019s Peircean insight) are not ruled out from the start\neither. The reason for this is different however. For pragmatists, the\nanti-metaphysical demarcation criterion is not strictly speaking a\nmeaning criterion. The pragmatic criterion of significance is\nexpressly epistemic, not semantic: it speaks of relevance with regard\nto an established cognitive practice, not in-principle\ntruth-evaluability. This criterion is most easily expressed as a\nconditional norm, alongside other methodological maxims. (If you want\nyour reasoning to be responsible to evidence, then avoid statements\nthat experience can neither confirm or disconfirm, however\nindirectly.) So the suggestion that the criterion of empirical\nsignificance can be regarded as a proposal for how to treat the\nlanguage of science cannot be brushed aside but for the persistent\nneglect of the philosophical projects of Carnap or the non-formalist\nleft Vienna Circle.\n\nStill, some readers may wonder whether in the course of responding to\nthe various counter-criticisms, the Vienna Circle\u2019s position has\nnot shifted considerably. This indeed is true: the attempt to show\nmetaphysics strictly meaningless once and for all did not succeed. For\neven if Carnap\u2019s 1956 criterion and the pragmatic approach work,\nthey do not achieve that: Carnap\u2019s criterion only works for\nconstructed languages and the pragmatic one does not address the\nsemantic issue and only works case by case. But it can be argued that\nwhile this debilitates the Vienna Circle\u2019s most notorious claim\n(if understood without qualifications), it does not debilitate their\nentire program. That was, we recall, to defend Enlightenment reason\nand to counter the abuse of possibly empty but certainly\nill-understood deep-sounding language in science and in public life.\nTheir program was, to put it somewhat anachronistically, to promote\nepistemic empowerment. This program would have been helped by an\nacross-the-board criterion to show metaphysics meaningless, but it can\nalso proceed in its absence.\n\nBut now the suspicion may be that if all that is meant to be excluded\nis speculative reason without due regard to empirical and\nlogico-linguistic evidence, the program\u2019s success appears too\neasy. Few contemporary philosophers would confess to such reckless\npractices. Still, even the rejection of speculative reason is by no\nmeans uncontroversial, as shown by the unresolved status of the appeal\nto intuitions that characterizes much of contemporary analytical\nmetaphysics and epistemology. Moreover, much depends on what\u2019s\nconsidered to be \u201cdue regard\u201d: is merely bad science\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d? Or only appeals to the supernatural? And\nwhat about de re necessities? Or the seeming commitments of\nexistential quantification? The promotion of anti-metaphysics may be\napplauded in principle as an exercise in intellectual hygiene, the\nobjection goes, but in practice it excludes either too much or too\nlittle: it either cripples our understanding of theoretical science or\nnormalizes away the Vienna Circle\u2019s most notorious claim.\n\nIn response it is helpful to consider the conception of metaphysics\nthat can be seen to be motivating much of the Circle\u2019s ethical\nnon-cognitivism. What did Carnap (1935) and Neurath (1932a) dismiss\nwhen they dismissed normative ethics as metaphysical and cognitively\nmeaningless? One may concede that due to the brusque way in which they\nput their broadly Humean point, they opened themselves up to\nsignificant criticism, but it is very important to see also what they\ndid not do. Most notably, they did not dismiss as meaningless all\nconcern with how to live. Conditional prescriptions remained\nstraight-forwardly truth-evaluable in instrumental terms and so\ncognitively meaningful. In addition, their own active engagement for\nEnlightenment values in public life showed that they took these\nmatters very seriously themselves. (In fact, their engagement as\npublic intellectuals compares strikingly with that of most\ncontemporary philosophers of science.) But neither did they fall\nvictim to the naturalistic fallacy nor were they simply inconsistent.\nIn the determination of basic values they rather saw acts of personal\nself-definition, but, characteristically, Carnap showed a more\nindividualistic and Neurath a more collectively oriented approach to the\nmatter. What needs to be borne in mind, then, is the meaning that they\nattached to the epithet \u201cmetaphysical\u201d in this and other\nareas: the arrogation of unique and fully determined objective insight\ninto matters beyond scientific reason. It was in the ambition of\nproviding such unconditional prescriptions that they saw philosophical\nethics being the heir of theology. (Compare Carnap 1935 and 1963b,\n\u00a732 and Neurath 1932a and 1944, \u00a719.) Needless to say, it\nremains contentious to claim those types of philosophical ethics to be\ncognitively meaningless that seek to derive determinate sets of codes\nfrom some indisputable principle or other. But the ongoing discussion\nof non-cognitivism and its persistent defense in analytical ethics as \u201cexpressivism\u201d\nsuggest that, understood as outlined, the Circle\u2019s\nnon-cognitivism was by no means absurd or contradictory.\n\nIt may be noted here that a newly discovered fragment of\nCarnap\u2019s writing (2017) has given fresh impetus to explorations\nof the model of ethical reasoning in terms of optatives that Carnap\noutlined (1963b, \u00a732) in response to A. Kaplan\u2019s criticism\n(1963) of his earlier position. What emerges is that Carnap was\nprepared to integrate ethical desiderata among non-ethical ones within\nthe network of means and ends that decision theory as a normative\ntheory of rational action seeks to systematize and regiment. Moral\nreasoning is assimilated to practical reasoning and no longer suffers\nfrom a deficit of significance\u2014albeit at the cost of not being\nable to exclude appeals to certain types of intrinsic value on the ground their being beyond the pale (see Carus 2017). Carnap\nmay reasonably respond here that as a theorist of science he is not\nrequired to account for normative ethics beyond providing a framework\nfor understanding its undeniable role in a generic theory of human\nbehavior. What was rightly objected against his earlier position was\nthat it made such understanding impossible.\n\nWhatever the details, their non-cognitivism supports the idea that the\nleft wing\u2019s anti-metaphysics was primarily deflationist. They opposed all claims to have a categorically deeper\ninsight into reality than either empirical or formal science, such\nthat philosophy would stand in judgement of these sciences as to their\nreality content or that mere science would stand in need of\nphilosophical interpretations. (Concerned with practical problems,\nthey likewise opposed philosophical claims to stand above the\ncontestations of mere mortals.) Importantly, such deflationism need\nnot remain general and vague, but can be given precise content. For\ninstance, it has been argued (Carus 1999) that Carnap was correct to understand Tarski\u2019s theory of truth not as a traditional\ncorrespondence theory such that truth consisted in some kind of\nagreement of statements or judgements and facts or the world where the\nlatter make true the former. In Carnap\u2019s unchanged opposition to\nthe classical correspondence theory of truth in turn lies not only the\ncontinuity between his own syntactic and semantic phases, but also the\nkey to his and the entire left Vienna Circle\u2019s understanding of\ntheir anti-metaphysical campaign. (On various occasions in the early\n30s, Hahn, Frank and Neurath opposed correspondence truth very\nexplicitly, while, in later years, Neurath resisted Tarskian semantics\nprecisely because he wrongly suspected it of resurrecting\ncorrespondentism and Frank continued to castigate correspondentism\nwhenever required. On this tangled issue, see Mormann 1999, Uebel\n2004, Mancosu 2008.)\n\nThis suggests that a hard core of Viennese anti-metaphysics survives\nthe criticism and subsequent qualifications of early claims made for\ntheir criteria of empirical significance, yet retains sufficient\nphilosophical teeth to remain of contemporary interest. The\nmetaphysics which the left wing attacked, besides everyday\nsupernaturalism and the supra-scientific essentialism of old, was the\ncorrespondence conception of truth and associated realist conceptions\nof knowledge. These notions were deemed attackable directly on\nepistemological grounds, without any diversion through the theory of\nmeaning: how could such correspondences or likenesses ever be\nestablished? As Neurath liked to put it (1930), we cannot step outside\nof our thinking to see whether a correspondence obtains between what\nwe think and how the world is. (Against defenses of the correspondence\ntheory by arguments from analogy it would be argued that the\nanalogy is overextended.) Against the counter that this is merely an\nepistemic argument that does not touch the ontological issue Neurath\nis likely to have argued that doing without an epistemic account is a\nrecipe for uncontrollable metaphysics.\n\nImportantly, the left wing\u2019s deflationary anti-metaphysics was\naccompanied by a distinctively constructivist attitude. Here one must\nhasten to add, of course, that what was constructed were not the\nobjects of first-order discourse (tables, chairs, electrons and black\nholes) but concepts, be they concepts associated with technical terms for observables, theoretical terms or terms needed for reflection\nabout the cognitive enterprise of science (ideas like evidence and its\ndegrees and presuppositions). As meta-theorists of science they\ndeveloped explications: different types of explications were\nenvisaged, ranging from analytic definitions giving necessary and\nsufficient conditions in formal languages all the way to pragmatic,\nexemplar-based criterial delimitations of the central applications of\ncontested concepts or practices. Two branches of the Circle\u2019s\nconstructivist tendency can thus be distinguished: Carnap\u2019s\nrational reconstructions and formalist explications and\nNeurath\u2019s and Frank\u2019s empirically informed and\npractice-oriented reconceptualizations. The difference between these\ntwo approaches can be understood as a division\nof labor between the tasks of exploring logico-linguistic\npossibilities of conceptual reconstruction and considering the\nefficacy of particular scientific practices. In principle, the\nconstructivist tendency in Vienna Circle philosophy was able to\nembrace both (compare Carnap 1934/37, \u00a772 and Neurath 1936b).\nHowever, in its own day, this two-track approach remained\nincompletely realized as philosophical relations between Carnap and\nNeurath soured over disputes stemming from mutual misunderstandings.\nFrank\u2019s final paper (1963) was a terse reminder that the logic\nof science was not the sole successor or replacement of traditional\nphilosophy and Carnap\u2019s response (1963b, \u00a73) again acknowledged the compatibility in principle of his logic of science and what Frank called the \u201cpragmatics of science\u201d (1957). \n\nConsidering the Vienna Circle as a whole in the light of this reading\nof its anti-metaphysical philosophy, we find the most striking\ndivision within it yet. Unlike Carnap and the left wing, Schlick had\nlittle problem with a correspondence theory of truth once it was\ncleansed of psychologistic and intuitive accretions and centered on\nthe idea of unique coordination of statement and fact. In this lay the\nstrongest sense of continuity between his pre-Vienna Circle\nGeneral Theory of Knowledge (1918/25) and his post-Tractarian\nepistemology (1935a, 1935b). (Schlick also showed little enthusiasm\nfor the constructivist tendencies which already the manifesto of 1929\nhad celebrated.) Allowing for some simplification, it must be noted\nthat Schlick\u2019s attack on metaphysics (which gradually weakened\nanyway) presupposed a non-constructivist reading of the criterion of\nsignificance. Whether his conception can escape the charge\nself-refutation must be left open here.\n",
