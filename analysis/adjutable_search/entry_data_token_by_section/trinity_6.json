Martin Pickup (2016) makes an analogy between these and\nthe idea of a triune God, inspiring his own \u201cLatin\u201d\naccount. Motivated by skepticism about any three-self theory, and\ntaking the \u201cAthanasian\u201d creed as a starting point, he\nunderstands the claims that each Person \u201cis God\u201d as\nasserting the numerical identity of God with that Person. While God is\nlike an extended simple, the relationships between the Persons is\n\u201canalogous to the relationships between the spatial regions that\nan extended simple occupies\u201d (418).\n\nTo expound the theory Pickup uses the terminology of a \u201cperson\nspace\u201d, an imagined realm of all possible persons, which is just\n\u201can abstraction of the facts about possible personhood\u201d\n(422). A point within person space is \u201ca representation of a\ngroup of properties that are jointly necessary and sufficient for\nbeing a certain possible person\u201d (423). This is supposed to help\nus \u201csee the conceptual space between being a certain person and\nbeing a certain entity\u201d (422, n. 18). Pickup gives some\nnon\u2013theological examples to motivate the idea that one thing may\noccupy multiple points of person space: the fictional example of Dr.\nJekyll and Mr. Hyde, and humans suffering from Dissociative Identity\nDisorders (420\u20131).\n\nThe prima facie trinitarian claims which generate a contradiction are\nas follows, where each \u201cis\u201d means numerical (absolute,\nnon-relative) identity.\n\nThe Father is God.\nThe Son is God.\nThe Holy Spirit is God.\nThe Father is not the Son.\nThe Father is not the Holy Spirit.\nThe Son is not the Holy Spirit.\n\n\nIf the three Persons are numerically distinct (4\u20136), then it\ncan\u2019t be that\u00a0all of them are numerically identical to some\none God. (1\u20133) Pickup proposes to understand these using person\nspace concepts. Using p1, p2, and p3 for different points in person\nspace, the points which correspond to being, respectively, the Father,\nSon, and Spirit, claims 1\u20133 are read as:\n\nThe occupant of p1 is God.\nThe occupant of p2 is God.\nThe occupant of p3 is God.\n\n\nThese claims entail the 1\u20133 we started with, understood as\nclaims of numerical identity. But this method of interpretation\ntransforms 4\u20136, which become:\n\np1 is not p2.\np1 is not p3.\np2 is not p3.\n\n\nIn other words, \u201c4. The Father is not the Son\u201d is not\nunderstood as asserting the numerical distinctness of the Father and\nthe Son, but rather, as asserting the distinction of the\nFather\u2019s person space from the Son\u2019s person space. (And\nsimilarly with 5, 6.) The point of all of this is that the six\ninterpreted claims seem to be coherent, such that possibly, all of\nthem are true. Notably, this account accepts what we can call\n\u201cPerson-collapse\u201d, the implication of 1-3 that the Father\njust is the Son, the Father just is the Spirit, and the Son just is\nthe Spirit. (In other words, those are numerically identical.) Thus,\nunlike many Trinity theories, this one is arguably compatible with a\ndoctrine of divine simplicity.\n\nPickup defends this account from several objections. Against the\nobjection that this is a heretical modalism, Pickup argues that it\ncan\u2019t be, since here God\u2019s being three Persons is a\nfundamental metaphysical fact, not a derivative fact. Further, each\nPerson is a real person, as real as any human person (426\u20137).\nStill, one may think the account denies the reality of the Persons.\nPickup clarifies that they are not so many distinct realities, but\nrather each just is God. Nor are they parts of God. When this theory\ncountenances the \u201cdistinctness of the Persons\u201d it is not\nimplying the numerical distinctness of the Persons, but only the\ndistinctness of the person spaces they occupy (p1, p2, and p3). But as\nexplained above, person spaces are not understood to be real entities\n(435).\n\nSecond, it can be objected that catholic tradition\u00a0demands the\nnumerical distinctness of the Persons. Pickup denies that it does,\nsince it aims to avoid tritheism and affirms that each just is God\n(427).\n\nThird, Person-collapse entails claims any trinitarian should deny,\nincluding that the Father just is the Son, and that the Spirit is\nthree Persons. (Being numerically the same with God, since God is\nthree Persons, the Holy Spirit will be three Persons.) Pickup concedes\nthat at first glance such claims \u201csound bad\u201d, but replies\nthat any \u201cLatin\u201d account of the Trinity will as such have\nto accept such claims (428).\n\nFourth, it is self-evident that if any x and any y are numerically\nidentical, it follows that x and y can\u2019t ever differ. But\narguably any account of the Trinity must allow that the Persons differ\nat least in respect of origin, so that only the Son is begotten, only\nthe Spirit proceeds, and only the Father begets the Son.\n\nIn reply, Pickup argues that metaphysicians who accept the possibility\nof extended simples also accept that such \u201ccan be heterogeneous:\nthat they can have different properties at the different locations at\nwhich they exist\u201d (429). Metaphysicians differ in how they try\nto show that this is possible (432\u20134). But according to Pickup,\nit is plausible that there are \u201cfundamental distributional\nproperties\u201d. An example of a distributional property is an\nobject being polka-dotted, which requires that it is one color some\nplaces and another color in other places. What is controversial is\nthat such properties can be fundamental, that they can belong to the\nbasic metaphysical structure of reality, rather than being explained\nas no more than various smaller items having non-distributional\nproperties (430). Thus, we should not think that an extended simple\nwhich is heterogeneous both has and lacks a property, being F and not\nbeing F. Rather, we should think that it has a single distributional\nproperty of being F at some of its locations and not being F at\nothers. If, for instance, an extended simple could be colored, it\nmight be polka-dotted, where this is understood as a fundamental\nproperty, rather than, for instance, black in some spots and not-black\nin others. Thus, we avoid saying that one and the same object at a\nsingle time is and is not black (429\u201331).\n\nApplied to the Trinity , Pickup suggests that what at first look like\ndifferent properties (generating the Son, being generated, and being\nspirated) really amount to a single distributional property of God,\nwhich he calls \u201cgeneration\u201d. This is the property of\ngenerating the Son at p1, being generated at p2, and being spirated at\np3. This is not a matter of God being different at different person\nspaces; rather, at each space God has the distributional property\ncalled \u201cgeneration\u201d (431). In this way, the theory does\nnot deny the indiscernibility of identicals, the principle that if any\nx and any y are numerically identical, then they can\u2019t ever\ndiffer. The persons of the Trinity, on this account, never do differ,\nalthough it may seem that way at first glance.\n\nAn objection to this is that the Father\u2019s generation of the Son\nimplies that the Father is logically or causally prior to the Son, and\na distributional property can\u2019t account for this. Pickup\nsuggests in reply that perhaps instead it is p1 which is prior to p2,\nor perhaps God\u2019s occupying p1 is prior to his occupying p2\n(432).\n\nFinally, it can be objected that necessarily, any person just is a\ncertain entity, and that even if this is false, still, it seems that\nnecessarily persons and entities can\u2019t be separated, so that if\nanything is one person it must be one entity as well (436). In reply,\nPickup denies that such claims are true, and suggests that\nconceptually, it seems that one may count persons and beings\ndifferently, even in merely human cases like the fictional Jekyll and\nHyde, which he takes to be an instance of one entity that is two\npersons (436, 420). Pickup also argues that it is a virtue of this\naccount that it doesn\u2019t specify what it takes to be a person\n(436).\n\nOne may object that the suggested paraphrase or interpretation of the\nstatements that no Person is either of the others seems to change the\nsubject from divine Persons to imaginary \u201cperson spaces\u201d.\nAgain, the cost of denying the numerical distinctness of the Persons\nmay be too high for many trinitarians to accept. And it would seem\nthat trinitarians are committed to many differences between the\nPersons other than the properties or relations relating to origin. The\nSon died, but the Father did not. The Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus\nat his baptism, but the Father and Son did not. The Father at\nJesus\u2019s baptism said \u201cThis is my beloved Son\u201d, but\nthe Son and Spirit did not. It is not clear that all of these seeming\ndifferences can be understood as really involving fundamental\ndistributional properties of God.\n",
