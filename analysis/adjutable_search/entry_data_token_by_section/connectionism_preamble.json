    "main_text": "\n\nConnectionism is a movement in cognitive science that hopes to explain\nintellectual abilities using artificial neural networks (also known as\n\u201cneural networks\u201d or \u201cneural nets\u201d). Neural\nnetworks are simplified models of the brain composed of large numbers\nof units (the analogs of neurons) together with weights that measure\nthe strength of connections between the units. These weights model the\neffects of the synapses that link one neuron to another. Experiments\non models of this kind have demonstrated an ability to learn such\nskills as face recognition, reading, and the detection of simple\ngrammatical structure.\n\nPhilosophers have become interested in connectionism because it\npromises to provide an alternative to the classical theory of the\nmind: the widely held view that the mind is something akin to a\ndigital computer processing a symbolic language. Exactly how and to\nwhat extent the connectionist paradigm constitutes a challenge to\nclassicism has been a matter of hot debate in recent years.\n",
