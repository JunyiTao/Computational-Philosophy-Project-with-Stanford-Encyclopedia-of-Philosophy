    "main_text": "\n\n\nTheists believe that reality\u2019s ultimate principle is God\u2014an\nomnipotent, omniscient, goodness that is the creative ground of\neverything other than itself. Monotheism is the view that there is\nonly one such God. After a brief discussion of monotheism\u2019s historical\norigins, this entry looks at the five most influential attempts to\nestablish God\u2019s uniqueness. We will consider arguments from God\u2019s\nsimplicity, from his perfection, from his sovereignty, from his\nomnipotence, and from his demand for total devotion. The entry\nconcludes by examining three major theistic traditions which contain\nstrands which might seem at odds with their commitment to\nmonotheism\u2014the Jewish Kabbalistic tradition, Christianity, and\nShri Vaishnavism.\n",
