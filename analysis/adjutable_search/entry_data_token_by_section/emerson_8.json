    "main_text": "Some Questions about Emerson || Consistency\n4.1 Consistency\n\nEmerson routinely invites charges of inconsistency. He says the world\nis fundamentally a process and fundamentally a unity; that it resists\nthe imposition of our will and that it flows with the power of our\nimagination; that travel is good for us, since it adds to our\nexperience, and that it does us no good, since we wake up in the new\nplace only to find the same \u201c sad self\u201d we thought we had\nleft behind (CW2: 46).\n\nEmerson\u2019s \u201cepistemology of moods\u201d is an attempt to\nconstruct a framework for encompassing what might otherwise seem\ncontradictory outlooks, viewpoints, or doctrines. Emerson really means\nto \u201caccept,\u201d as he puts it, \u201cthe clangor and jangle\nof contrary tendencies\u201d (CW3: 36). He means to be irresponsible\nto all that holds him back from his self-development. That is why, at\nthe end of \u201cCircles,\u201d he writes that he is \u201conly an\nexperimenter\u2026with no Past at my back\u201d (CW2: 188). In the\nworld of flux that he depicts in that essay, there is nothing stable\nto be responsible to: \u201cevery moment is new; the past is always\nswallowed and forgotten, the coming only is sacred\u201d (CW2:\n189).\n\nDespite this claim, there is considerable consistency in\nEmerson\u2019s essays and among his ideas. To take just one example,\nthe idea of the \u201cactive soul\u201d \u2013 mentioned as the\n\u201cone thing in the world, of value\u201d in \u2018The American\nScholar\u2019 \u2013 is a presupposition of Emerson\u2019s attack\non \u201cthe famine of the churches\u201d (for not feeding or\nactivating the souls of those who attend them); it is an element in\nhis understanding of a poem as \u201ca thought so passionate and\nalive, that, like the spirit of a plant or an animal, it has an\narchitecture of its own \u2026\u201d (CW3: 6); and, of course, it\nis at the center of Emerson\u2019s idea of self-reliance. There are\nin fact multiple paths of coherence through Emerson\u2019s\nphilosophy, guided by ideas discussed previously: process, education,\nself-reliance, and the present.\n",
