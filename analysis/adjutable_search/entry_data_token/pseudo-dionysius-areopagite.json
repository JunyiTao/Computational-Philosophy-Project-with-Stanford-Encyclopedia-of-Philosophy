Dionysius: Persona\n\nThough Pseudo-Dionysius lived in the late fifth and early sixth\ncentury C.E., his works were written as if they were composed by St.\nDionysius the Areopagite, who was a member of the Athenian judicial\ncouncil (known as \u2018the Areopagus\u2019) in the 1st century C.E.\nand who was converted by St. Paul. Thus, these works might be regarded\nas a successful \u2018forgery\u2019, providing Pseudo-Dionysius with\nimpeccable Christian credentials that conveniently antedated Plotinus\nby close to two hundred years. So successful was this stratagem that\nDionysius acquired almost apostolic authority, giving his writings\nenormous influence in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, though his\nviews on the Trinity and Christ (e.g., his emphasis upon the single\ntheandric activity of Christ (see Letter 4) as opposed to the\nlater orthodox view of two activities) were not always accepted as\northodox since they required repeated defenses, for example, by John\nof Scythopolis and by Maximus Confessor. Dionysius\u2019 fictitious\nidentity, doubted already in the sixth century by Hypatius of Ephesus\nand later by Nicholas of Cusa, was first seriously called into\nquestion by Lorenzo Valla in 1457 and John Grocyn in 1501, a critical\nviewpoint later accepted and publicized by Erasmus from 1504 onward.\nBut it has only become generally accepted in modern times that instead\nof being the disciple of St. Paul, Dionysius must have lived in the\ntime of Proclus, most probably being a pupil of Proclus, perhaps of\nSyrian origin, who knew enough of Platonism and the Christian\ntradition to transform them both. Since Proclus died in 485 CE, and\nsince the first clear citation of Dionysius\u2019 works is by Severus\nof Antioch between 518 and 528, then we can place Dionysius\u2019\nauthorship between 485 and 518\u201328 CE. These dates are confirmed\nby what we find in the Dionysian corpus: a knowledge of Athenian\nNeoplatonism of the time, an appeal to doctrinal formulas and parts of\nthe Christian liturgy (e.g., the Creed) current in the late fifth\ncentury, and an adaptation of late fifth-century Neoplatonic religious\nrites, particularly theurgy, as we shall see below.\n\nIt must also be recognized that \u201cforgery\u201d is a modern\nnotion. Like Plotinus and the Cappadocians before him, Dionysius does\nnot claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a\ntradition. Adopting the persona of an ancient figure was a long\nestablished rhetorical device (known as declamatio), and\nothers in Dionysius\u2019 circle also adopted pseudonymous names from\nthe New Testament. Dionysius\u2019 works, therefore, are much less a\nforgery in the modern sense than an acknowledgement of reception and\ntransmission, namely, a kind of coded recognition that the resonances\nof any sacred undertaking are intertextual, bringing the diachronic\nstructures of time and space together in a synchronic way, and that\nthis theological teaching, at least, is dialectically received from\nanother. Dionysius represents his own teaching as coming from a\ncertain Hierotheus and as being addressed to a certain Timotheus. He\nseems to conceive of himself, therefore, as an in-between figure, very\nlike a Dionysius the Areopagite, in fact. Finally, if Iamblichus and\nProclus can point to a primordial, pre-Platonic wisdom, namely, that\nof Pythagoras, and if Plotinus himself can claim not to be an\noriginator of a tradition (after all, the term Neoplatonism is just a\nconvenient modern tag), then why cannot Dionysius point to a\ndistinctly Christian theological and philosophical resonance in an\nearlier pre-Plotinian wisdom that instantaneously bridged the gap\nbetween Judaeo-Christianity (St. Paul) and Athenian paganism (the\nAreopagite)? [For a different view of Dionysius as crypto-pagan, see\nLankila, 2011, 14\u201340.] \n2. Reading Dionysius\u2019 Works\n\nReading Dionysius can be a difficult business for many reasons: partly\nbecause his frequent hyperbolic theological language is foreign to our\nown English-speaking practices; partly because almost every word he\nemploys resonates with the whole history of ancient thought, from the\nChristian Platonism of the Fathers, particularly, Gregory of Nyssa and\nthe Cappadocians, to the Neoplatonism of Plotinus, Iamblichus, and\nProclus, while his theology focuses predominantly upon the Jewish and\nChristian scriptures (which Dionysius calls \u201cdivine\noracles\u201d); partly, again, because the order in which we are to\nread his works is unclear and because Dionysius mentions at least\nseven works that have been lost. So we are unsure how to read him\nsince so much seems doubtful or potentially fictitious. This picture\nis further complicated by the titles subdividing portions of his\nworks, which appear, because of terminology peculiar to them, to have\nbeen inserted by a later hand or hands.\n\nThe surviving writings are four treatises and ten letters. The four\ntreatises are: 1) On the divine names (DN) (Peri\ntheion onomaton, in Greek; De Divinis Nominibus, in\nLatin), the longest work of thirteen chapters that deals with\naffirmative or kataphatic theology, namely, the names attributed to\nGod the creator in scripture and also in pagan texts, but also\nexploring the limits of language and therefore also involving negative\nor apophatic theology. 2) On the celestial hierarchy\n(CH) (Peri tes ouranias hierarchias, in Greek;\nDe coelesti hierarchia, in Latin), a work that examines how\nthe nine choirs of angels (in scripture) are to be understood in\nlifting us up to God. 3) On the ecclesiastical hierarchy\n(EH) (Peri tes ekklestiastikes hierarchias, in\nGreek; De ecclesiastica hierarchia, in Latin) that examines\nthe various orders and liturgy of the church as relating us to God\nthrough a divinely appointed but human hierarchy. And 4) On\nMystical theology (MT) (Peri mustikes\ntheologias, in Greek; De mystica theologia, in Latin), a\nbrief but powerful work that deals with negative or apophatic theology\nand in which theology becomes explicitly \u201cmystical\u201d for\nthe first time in history (By mystical here we do not mean an\nextraordinary or private experience of transcending one\u2019s self\nin the modern sense of the term, but simply \u201chidden\u201d. On\nthis see Bouyer, 1949; Vanneste, 1959; McGinn 1994). There follow ten\nletters that provide helpful comments upon topics in the above four\ntreatises, especially letter 9 on what Dionysius calls symbolic\ntheology of which works 2) and 3) above (CH; EH)\nform a substantial part. The ten letters appear to be arranged in a\nroughly hierarchical order, letters 1\u20134 being addressed to a\nmonk (a certain Gaius, also the name of one or more of St.\nPaul\u2019s companions), letter 5 to a deacon, letter 6 to a priest,\nand letters 7 and 9 to hierarchs or bishops. Letter 8 disrupts this\norder since it is addressed to a monk charged with disrupting the\nhierarchical order itself!\n\nWhat order of the works are we to adopt? In the French translation of\nM. de Gandillac and the English translation of C. Luibheid and P.\nRorem (see bibliography), the order is DN, MT,\nCH and EH. In the manuscripts of the Areopagitic\ncorpus, the order is CH, EH, DN,\nMT, followed by the Letters. Dionysius himself provides an\nexplanatory outline that favors the order of Luibheid and Rorem, and\nthat gives a systematic organization to his body of work, including\nboth the treatises we presently possess and also the treatises which\neither no longer exist or, more likely, were never written. His\noutline is especially valuable for two of these latter\ntreatises\u2014the Theological Representations and the\nSymbolic Theology\u2014since the order in which he claims to\nhave written them reveals both the relative worth of their contents\nand the sequence in which the reader should proceed. It thus helps the\nreader to divine the nature of their content, and to put them in their\nproper place with the remaining two works written by Dionysius on the\nforms of theology. The first three\u2014the Theological\nRepresentations, On the Divine Names, and the\nSymbolic Theology\u2014discuss ever more divided and\nsensuous forms of theology. The fourth theological work, the\nMystical Theology, reverses the sequence and restores the\nreader to the divine unity:\n\nIn the earlier books my argument traveled downward from the most\nexalted to the humblest categories, taking in on this downward path an\never-increasing number of ideas which multiplied with every stage of\nthe descent. But my argument now rises from what is below up to the\ntranscendent, and the more it climbs, the more language falters, and\nwhen it has passed up and beyond the ascent, it will turn silent\ncompletely, since it will finally be at one with him who is\nundescribable (MT 1033 C).\n\n\nIn this article we shall adopt a variant of this last order both\nbecause Dionysius himself seems to have favored it and because it\nclarifies the systematic structure of the theological works. \n3. Outline and Content of the Works\n3.1 Theological Representations\n\nAlthough the Theological Representations is not extant, we\nare able to glean its content from Dionysius\u2019 ample descriptions\nof it in his other works. It seems to have devoted itself to names for\nthe three persons within the godhead and their attributes. These names\nare the representations mentioned in the work\u2019s title. They\ndescribe two forms of differentiation within the godhead: the\ndistinction into persons, and into attributes of the persons. Names\nfor the persons include \u201cFather,\u201d \u201cSon,\u201d and\n\u201cHoly Spirit.\u201d Names for the attributes include\n\u201csource,\u201d \u201coffshoot,\u201d \u201cflower,\u201d\nand \u201clight.\u201d Dionysius does not explain why he uses the\nterm \u201crepresentation\u201d (hypotuposis) for these\nnames, but his fondness for puns may have led him to adopt it because\nof its similarity to \u201cperson\u201d (hypostasis).\n\nSome of these names describe more than a person within the godhead.\nThe name \u201cfather,\u201d for instance, may also be used of\nanimals, in which case it means the male parent. We seem to apply such\nnames literally to animals and only metaphorically to persons within\nthe godhead. But Dionysius uncovers a passage from Paul\u2019s letter\nto the Ephesians which leads him to claim otherwise. Paul says that\nGod the Father is the one \u201cfrom whom all fatherhood in the\nheavens and on earth is named.\u201d On the basis of this scriptural\nauthority, Dionysius explains that we are able to use the terms\n\u201cfather\u201d and \u201cson\u201d of animals only because the\ngodhead has already undergone the same relation. In other words, the\ninternal causality exercised within the godhead is the source of all\nother causality. This includes not only the causation of one animal by\nanother, but of one angel by another, since angels, too, receive the\nnames of \u201cfather\u201d and \u201cson.\u201d\n3.2 On the Divine Names\n\nStrictly speaking, all of the theological works except for the\nTheological Representations devote themselves to divine names\nor names for the godhead. But Dionysius devotes his second theological\ntreatise, entitled On the Divine Names only to a particular\nkind of divine name. This kind of name describes a third distinction\nwithin the godhead (in addition to the distinction of persons and of\npersonal attributes): the distinction into the multiple attributes of\nthe godhead as a whole. Though the names apply to the godhead as a\nwhole, and so refer to it as a unity, each name is different and so,\ntaken together, they differentiate the godhead. The implicit\ndistinction between the unity of the godhead and the multiplicity of\nthe names is reflected in the very structure of the names themselves.\nEach name includes the same prefix: \u201cover-\u201d, or\nhyper- in Greek, which indicates the unity of the godhead to\nwhom the names are applied. But each name is different, indicating the\nself-multiplication of the godhead. The result is a set of names like\n\u201cover-good,\u201d \u201cover-being,\u201d and\n\u201cover-life.\u201d Occasionally, Dionysius also makes use of a\nsecond, equivalent prefix: \u201cpre-\u201d or pro- in\nGreek. God is \u201cpre-good,\u201d and \u201cpre-being,\u201d\nmeaning that he has the attributes of creatures in a way that\ntranscends both creature and attribute. The \u201cover-\u201d and\n\u201cpre-\u201d prefixes must be applied strictly to the names when\nthey are used of God in himself. On the other hand, when the names are\nused only of God as cause, the prefixes may be left off, since the\ncausality of God is already a procession into the differentiation\nproperly signified by each of the different names.\n\nSome of Dionysius\u2019 later medieval interpreters suggest that God\npossesses the attributes of creatures in their most proper and ideal\nform, but Dionysius himself does not suggest this. Instead, the most\nproper object of the names is the highest creature. The exemplary\ninstances of \u201cgoodness,\u201d \u201cbeing,\u201d and\n\u201clife,\u201d for example, are the highest of the angels or\nintelligible minds, as Dionysius also calls them. For this reason,\nDionysius frequently refers to this type of name as an\n\u201cintelligible name.\u201d He incorporates into the number of\nintelligible names the traditional Neoplatonic intelligible\ncategories: being, identity, difference, rest, and motion, as well as\nthe Neoplatonic triad of being, life, and intellect. The fact that God\ntranscends the proper meaning of these names does not mean that he\nought to be called \u201cnon-being,\u201d \u201cnon-life,\u201d or\n\u201cnon-intellect.\u201d Dionysius prefers simply to say that God\nis \u201cover being,\u201d \u201cover life,\u201d and \u201cover\nintellect.\u201d\n\nThe intelligible names could form the ground of a theology independent\nof any specific religious tradition or sacred text. Many of them are\ncentral to Platonic sources outside the context of Christianity, and\nappear only incidentally and obscurely in the Hebrew and Christian\nscriptures. They also describe the intelligible structure of the\ncosmos, a structure that is accessible to all human inquiry, whether\nassisted by scriptural texts or not. But Dionysius explicitly denies\nthat the names may be acquired from any source other than the Hebrew\nand Christian scriptures. Even if the names could be derived from\ncontemplation of the world\u2019s intelligible structure, we apply\nthem in theology to the cause of that structure and not to the\nstructure itself. Since the cause of that structure is beyond the\ngrasp of human inquiry, we cannot rely on our own powers for our\ndescription. We depend instead on the revelation of the scriptures as\nour source for the intelligible names.\n\nFew human beings have the ability to contemplate the intelligible\nnames in their purity. Most of us require the names to be incarnated\nin visible things before we can understand them. Unable to see\n\u201cbeing,\u201d \u201clife,\u201d and \u201cwisdom\u201d in\nthemselves, we need a visible being who is living and wise. Such a\nperson can then become the means by which we contemplate the\nintelligible. Dionysius\u2019 possibly fictional teacher Hierotheus\nis one such visible incarnation of the names. But Hierotheus may do\nmore than incarnate the names. He can also unfold them in speech,\ntaking the unitary name of \u201cbeing\u201d and describing it at\nlength, as Dionysius does in the fifth chapter of On the Divine\nNames. As he describes it, the name unfolds itself into a form\nthat is more multiple, because of the many words used in his\ndescription. It thus approaches the multiple character of our ordinary\nhuman way of knowing, and becomes more easily understood.\n3.3 Symbolic Theology\n\nOther names directly refer to visible things, whose multiplicity and\naccessibility to sensation make them easy for us to understand. The\ndifficulty with these names, referred to by Dionysius and the\nNeoplatonic tradition generally as \u201csymbols,\u201d is that they\nhave no inherent relation to the godhead at all. Their literal\nsignification is restricted to the realm of the sensuous, and so they\nmust be turned into metaphors if they are to become useful for\ntheology. This is the task of Dionysius\u2019 Symbolic\nTheology. Though the work itself is not extant, we find him\nundertaking the same project in each of his extant works.\n\nOne of Dionysius\u2019 favorite sources of symbols is a verse from\nthe 78th psalm: \u201cthe Lord awoke, like a strong man,\npowerful but reeling with wine.\u201d Taken literally, the verse\nindicates that God sleeps and gets drunk on wine, two activities that\nproperly apply only to embodied, visible beings. Only an embodied\nbeing can manifest the activities to which the names\n\u201csleep\u201d and \u201cdrunkenness\u201d literally refer. If\nwe are to apply such terms to God, they must be attached to a foreign,\nintelligible content that will be able to lead the interpreter of the\nsymbolic name to the contemplation of an intelligible name. In\n\u201csleep,\u201d for example, Dionysius finds a meaning common to\nboth intelligible and visible things: withdrawal from the world. He\nconcludes that God\u2019s sleep is his \u201cremoval from and lack\nof communication with the objects of his providence.\u201d In\ndrunkenness, Dionysius sees a kind of over-filling, and so he explains\nthat God\u2019s drunkenness is \u201cthe overloaded measurelessness\nof all goods in the one who is their cause.\u201d From the easily\ncomprehended literal meaning of the term, the reader rises to the more\ndifficult intelligible terrain of imparticipability and\nmeasurelessness.\n\nDrunkenness and sleep are what Dionysius calls \u201cdissimilar\nsimilarities.\u201d They strike us as exceptionally unworthy of God,\nand so are \u201cdissimilar,\u201d yet they reveal an intelligible\ntruth capable of leading us to him, and so are \u201csimilar.\u201d\nDionysius privileges such names over more appropriate names like\n\u201cgolden\u201d and \u201cluminous.\u201d The more that the\nname seems appropriate, the more we are likely to be lulled into\nthinking that we have adequately comprehended the godhead in our use\nof the name. The very materiality and ignobility of the dissimilar\nsimilarities cry out that the names do not literally describe the\ngodhead, and compel the reader to seek the intelligible truth behind\nthe name.\n\nWe may wonder whether the symbolic names are a necessary part of\ntheology at all, since their content belongs to the intelligible\ntheology and not to a \u201csymbolic\u201d theology. Dionysius\nrepeatedly affirms their necessity, not because of the character of\ntheir content, but because of the nature of the human soul. The soul\nmay be divided into two parts: one passionate and the other\npassionless. Passionate here means set in motion by things exterior to\nthe soul. The senses, for example, are passionate because they can\nonly function when an outside object gives them something to sense.\nDionysius follows a longstanding Neoplatonic tradition when he says\nthat most of us are unable to engage our passionless part directly.\nInstead, our passionless part comes into play only indirectly, through\nthe activity of the passionate part. By sensing the world around us,\nwe are led to contemplate its intelligible structures through the\nsensations we receive. Even those few human beings who can engage\ntheir passionless part directly find it helpful to shore up their\ncontemplation with examples drawn from the senses. Dionysius may\nunderstand the causality of God directly, and yet still find it\nhelpful to compare God\u2019s causality to the emanation of light\nfrom the sun.\n\nSuch examples do not require the presence of a revealed scripture.\nSkilled teachers in any subject are characterized by their ability to\ncome up with helpful examples drawn from ordinary experience when\nexplaining a difficult intelligible truth. Dionysius himself\nfrequently resorts to examples \u201cat our level\u201d in order to\nexplain something intelligible. The scriptural symbol goes further,\nattempting to reveal the God who is before and beyond even the\nintelligible truth. The highest human intellect has little ability to\nattain this truth directly, and so we cannot rely on intellectual\nteachers as guides to that truth. We require the gift of symbols,\nwhich tie our ordinary comprehension to the godhead beyond being. And\nso Dionysius does not describe the symbolic names as pedagogical tools\ndeveloped by theologians. The names appear instead in the ecstatic\nvisions of the prophets. Though Dionysius explicitly asserts our\ndependence on the Hebrew and Christian scriptures as the source of\nthese symbols, he has no qualms about embellishing the list of names\nwith symbols drawn from other traditions. For instance, he discusses\nat length the name of \u201cmixing bowl,\u201d which has no real\nsource in the Christian or Hebrew scriptures, but occurs centrally in\nthe Platonic philosophy deriving from Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus.\n3.4 Mystical Theology\n\nWhen Dionysius praises \u201cdissimilar similarities\u201d over\nseemingly more appropriate symbolic names for God, he explains that at\nleast some dissimilar names are negations, and negations are more\nproper to God than affirmations. The Mystical Theology has\nthis last, most arcane form of theology as its subject. Negations are\nproperly applied not only to the names of the symbolic theology. Any\nand all of the divine names must be negated, beginning with those of\nthe symbolic theology, continuing with the intelligible names and\nconcluding with the theological representations. The godhead is no\nmore \u201cspirit,\u201d \u201csonship,\u201d and\n\u201cfatherhood\u201d than it is \u201cintellect\u201d or\n\u201casleep.\u201d These negations must be distinguished from\nprivations. A privation is simply the absence of a given predicate\nthat could just as easily be present. The absence of the predicate is\nopposed to its presence: \u201clifeless\u201d is opposed to\n\u201cliving.\u201d But when we say that the godhead is not\n\u201cliving,\u201d we do not mean that it is\n\u201clifeless.\u201d The godhead is beyond the lifeless as well as\nbeyond the living. For this reason, Dionysius says that our\naffirmations of the godhead are not opposed to our negations, but that\nboth must be transcended: even the negations must be negated.\n\nThe most controversial and arcane passages of the Mystical\nTheology revolve around the mystical as taken in itself and not\nas the act of negating the other forms of theology. Dionysius says\nthat after all speaking, reading, and comprehending of the names\nceases, there follows a divine silence, darkness, and unknowing. All\nthree of these characteristics seem privative, as though they were\nsimply being the absence of speech, sight, and knowledge respectively.\nBut Dionysius does not treat them as privative. Instead, he uses\ntemporal and spatial language to mark off a special place and time for\nthem. Using as his example the account of Moses\u2019 ascent up Mount\nSinai in the Hebrew scriptures, Dionysius says that after Moses\nascends through the sensible and intelligible contemplation of God, he\nthen enters the darkness above the mountain\u2019s peak. The darkness\nis located above the mountain, and Moses enters it after his\ncontemplation of God in the various forms of theology. Dionysius\nleaves the relation between Moses and the darkness highly obscure.\nSome commentators reduce it to a form of knowing, albeit an\nextraordinary form of knowing. Others reduce it to a form of affective\nexperience, in which Moses feels something that he can never know or\nexplain in words. Dionysius himself does not give decisive evidence in\nfavor of either interpretive move. He speaks only of Moses\u2019\n\u201cunion\u201d with the ineffable, invisible, unknowable\ngodhead.\n3.5 On the Celestial and Ecclesiastical Hierarchies\n\nPerhaps even more vexing than the nature of union in Dionysius is the\nquestion of how the theological treatises relate to Dionysius\u2019\ntwo treatises on hierarchy. The Mystical Theology suggests an\nascent from the lower sensuous realm of reality through the\nintelligible intermediate realm to the darkness of the godhead itself,\nall accomplished by a single person. The hierarchic treatises, on the\nother hand, suggest that the sensible and intelligible realms are not\nplaces reached by a single being, but different kinds of beings, and\nthat the vision of God is handed from being to being downward through\nthe levels of the hierarchy. On the Celestial Hierarchy\ndescribes the intelligible realm as divided into nine ranks of beings:\nthe seraphim, cherubim, thrones, dominions, powers, authorities,\nprincipalities, archangels, and angels. On the Ecclesiastical\nHierarchy describes the human beings within the church as divided\ninto eight ranks: the hierarchs or bishops, priests, deacons, monks,\nlaity, catechumens, penitents, and the demon-possessed. Dionysius does\nnot address human life outside the church, except for a few scattered\nreferences to the angels presiding over other religious traditions and\nthe earlier \u201clegal hierarchy\u201d of the Jewish rite, which\nprecedes the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Christian rite.\n\nThe hierarchs, highest within the human hierarchy, contemplate the\nintelligible realm directly, though presumably they contemplate only\nits lowest level: the angels. The visible result of the\nhierarchs\u2019 contemplation of the angels is the series of rites\nbelonging to the Christian church. Since the hierarchs are able to\ncontemplate the intelligible directly, they do not perform the rites\nfor their own sake, but for the sake of the monks and laity, who have\nno capacity for direct intelligible contemplation. The monks and laity\nare able to engage the passionless part of their souls only through\nthe passionate part, and so they require a visible trigger\u2014the\nsymbol\u2014to stimulate their intelligible contemplation. The ranks\nof hierarch, priest, and deacon are in charge of administering the\nrites, with a specific set of initiates in their care and a specific\naction to perform. The deacons purify the catechumens, penitents, and\npossessed, primarily by giving them ethical instruction. The priests\nilluminate the laity, who are able to receive the intelligible truth.\nThe hierarchs perfect, a task whose initiate seems ideally to be the\nmonk, since Dionysius identifies the monks as leading the more perfect\nlife of those who are not explicitly consecrated as clergy.\n\nThe very structure of the church reflects the different roles of the\nclergy and the laity. The hierarch stands still at the altar, facing\naway from the multiplicity of the church\u2019s interior. He enters\nthe nave of the church only to bring sacred objects like incense,\nbread and wine, and holy oil into the realm of multiplicity, the\nspatially extended nave. When he brings the censer into the nave, for\nexample, its fragrance is distributed to the laity there, just as the\nbread and wine are later distributed in the eucharistic rite. The\nhierarch then returns to the altar, and takes up again his own proper\nobject of contemplation, the intelligible source of the rites. The\nlaity, on the other hand, remain within the spatially extended nave,\nbut orient themselves toward the altar, where the sacred objects are\nraised for their contemplation. Before this contemplation can occur,\nthe catechumens, penitents, and the demon-possessed must be removed\nfrom the church. Their orientation toward the material prevents them\nfrom adequately contemplating the intelligible truth through its\nvisible manifestation in the sacred objects.\n\nAlthough the rites have intelligible contemplation as their goal, it\ndoes not appear that non-ritual forms of contemplation, like reading,\ncan substitute for participation in the rites. Dionysian contemplation\nis public, so that it may unite us to each other; it involves prayer,\nso that it may unite us explicitly with the godhead; it also requires\nbodies, since only the interaction of bodies allows the contemplative\nact to include both components of our nature: body and soul. The names\nused in Dionysius\u2019 theological treatises acquire their salvific\npower in this liturgical context. Although the rites involve the\nperformance of bodily actions, they clothe themselves in words: the\nHebrew and Christian scriptures, and the oral tradition of the\nliturgical prayers. Only the silence and unknowing of the Mystical\nTheology finds no clear place within the liturgical rites of the\nhierarchy, since it transcends both the visible rites of the laity and\nthe intelligible contemplation of the clergy. It may be that, just as\nsome points of the liturgy call for a literal silence, the\nintelligible contemplation of the hierarch at the altar must engage in\nits own form of silence, so as to allow the appearance of the godhead\nbeyond naming. On this question, however, Dionysius is as silent as\nthe mystical theology which crowns his vision of the human ascent to\nGod.\n4. Sources, Ideas, Character of Writing, Terms: Christianity and Neoplatonism\n\nHaving examined the plan and content of these works let us now take a\nbrief look at some of the sources of Dionysius\u2019 ideas (and\nassociated problems), and at the character of Dionysius\u2019 writing\nin order to determine what in practice he is actually doing and to see\nif there is anything genuinely philosophical in his writing.\n4.1 Sources, Ideas, and Terms\n\nThere is a major tension between Platonism and Christianity in\nDionysius\u2019 writing. Luther expressed the negative side of this\ntension: \u201cDionysius is most pernicious; he platonizes more than\nhe Christianizes\u201d (Babylonian Captivity of the Church\n(Weimarer Ausgabe 6, 562)). Von Balthasar has been more\npositive, seeing Dionysius\u2019 Christianization of Neoplatonism\n\u201cas a side-effect of his own properly theological\nendeavor\u201d, namely, \u201cthe clear realized synthesis of truth\nand beauty, of theology and aesthetics\u201d (The Glory of the\nLord, vol. 2, 148\u20139). Perhaps one may suggest that neither\nChristianity nor Platonism are side shows in Dionysius\u2019 thought;\nThey are rather mutually important whole perspectives that do not get\nlost in the mix, no matter how subordinate Neoplatonism nonetheless\nmay be to Christianity for Dionysius himself. Dionysius\u2019 central\nconcern is how a triune God, that he calls\u2014among other\nthings\u2014the thearchy (god-rule; god-beginning), who is utterly\nunknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond\neven goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of\ncreation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of\ntheir source. To this end Dionysius employs some major Neoplatonic\ninsights: (1) The abiding\u2014procession\u2014return or conversion\nof all things as the creative and receptive expression of what it\nmeans for anything created to be. In Proclus\u2019 terms in the\nElements of Theology, prop. 35: \u201cEvery effect remains\nin its cause, proceeds from it, and converts to it\u201d. This is a\nway of expressing the vertical connectedness of everything by\nidentity, difference, and the overcoming of difference by a return to\nidentity that constitutes the nature of anything that is caused. (2)\nThe hierarchical ordering of beings as an expression of both their\nnatural placements and their freedoms as well as the simultaneous\nimmediacy, without intermediary, of the unknown God\u2019s presence\n(on hierarchy see CH 3). Each thing and order bears relation\nto the whole or manifests the whole, but \u201caccording to its own\ncapacity\u201d, as the famous Neoplatonic saying puts it. A rock or a\nworm, for instance, is a window upon the entire universe if you only\nknow how to look.\n\nIn the case of (1), the contrast between Dionysius and Neoplatonism\nshould not be taken to be a contrast between free divine creation, on\nthe one hand, and supposed emanation or illumination by necessity, on\nthe other, for divine/ human freedom and creation out of\n\u201cnothing\u201d are conspicuous facets of Neoplatonic thought as\nwell. What we see in Dionysius is rather a new way of understanding\nthe abiding, outpouring, and return, not only concretely in relation\nto the various hierarchies, and structurally in relation to the\nvarious works (DN is more concerned with procession, for\ninstance, while EH, CH, and MT deal with\ndifferent levels of return), but also in relation to God\u2019s\nprovidential love that, while remaining supereminently identical to\nitself, and precontaining everything within itself, nonetheless is the\ncreative power overflowing into its effects (procession) in order to\nbring them back into identity (return): \u201c[The Cause of All] is\n\u2018all in all\u2018, as scripture affirms, and certainly he is to\nbe praised as being for all things the creator and originator, the One\nwho brings them to completion, their preserver, their protector, and\ntheir home, the power which returns them to itself, and all this in\nthe one single, irrepressible, and supreme act\u201d (DN 1,\n7, 596c\u2013597a).\n\nIn the case of (2) (hierarchy and divine presence), Dionysius\nemphasizes, much more so than the impression often suggested by\nNeoplatonism, the directness of creation. Every being, no\nmatter where it is placed in the scale of beings and no matter how\ndependent it might be on beings ontologically higher than it (e.g.,\nfor human beings, angels) is directly and immediately dependent upon\nGod in and for its existence. Again, the contrasts often drawn between\nNeoplatonism\u2019s \u201cflight of the alone to the alone\u201d\nand Dionysius\u2019 community of hierarchy or between the supposed\nNeoplatonic view that the One causes the existence of lower beings\nonly through the mediation of the higher, while Christianity sees\ncreation as immediate are simply false or too simplistic.\nPlotinus\u2019 mysticism is not \u201csolitary\u201d in the sense\noften supposed and, for Plotinus, Porphyry, and Proclus, the One\ncauses existence immediately and most profoundly, whatever other\ninfluences enter into the complexity of existence. What we see in\nDionysius, by contrast, is a retention of one\u2019s place in\nhierarchy and a very concrete return to identity\u2014in the case of\nhuman beings, for instance, through scripture, ritual, and practical\nperformance to a deeper union with God rather than a simple, spatially\nconceived movement \u201cup\u201d the hierarchy. More broadly still,\nwe see in Dionysius\u2019 thought new possibilities for thinking\nabout divine love, a love that combines beyond beingness and\nunrestricted being, transcendence and yet even a kind of\nhyperessential vulnerability in rather startling ways, new ways\nconsequently of thinking about both divine and human eros,\nabout affectivity (cf. Dionysius\u2019 famous dictum about learning\nfrom sacred writers, or discovering the truth oneself, or not only\nlearning but \u201cexperiencing the divine things\u201d (pathein\nta theia) (DN 2, 9); and compare Aristotle, fr. 15\n(Rose) and Hebrews 5:8), about the nature of signification\nand the limits of language (see section 4 below), about the theory of\nevil as privation and non-being, however dependent this is upon one of\nProclus\u2019 opuscula (cf. DN 4, 18\u201335),\nabout the aesthetic richness of this world in the light of theology\nand the life of the Church, and even about the soul\u2013body\nrelation, though anthropology is not a part of Dionysius\u2019\nprimary concern (but see his comments at EH 404B, 433c,\n437a\u2013440a, 441b, 553a ff, 565b\u2013c).\n\nTwo examples will have to suffice here: (a) Dionysius\u2019\nremarkable description of the ecstatic love of God and (b) his radical\ntransformation of the Neoplatonic intelligible and sensible\nworlds.\n\n(a) First, Dionysius evidently cannot accept in any single\nstraightforward sense the Neoplatonic notion of a One that excludes\nthe possibility of expressing trinity. He therefore links in a new way\nGod as unrestricted being with God as utterly beyond being or any\ndeterminate predications. At the same time in the DN he\nargues that the ecstasy of love, which moves as a unifying force\nthrough creation without departing from itself, is the divine nature.\nDionysius admits, in a note from Plato\u2019s Phaedrus, that\nit is characteristic of yearning not to allow \u201clovers to belong\nto themselves but only to their loved ones\u201d (DN 4, 13).\nThis is shown, he goes on to argue, by the providential care of the\ngreater for the lesser (a reference to Proclus\u2019 divine\nprovidential love (eros pronoetikos) from the Commentary\non the First Alcibiades, #56), by the love of equals, and by that\nof the lesser for those better than them (a reference both to\nAristotle\u2019s seminal treatment of friendship in the\nNicomachean Ethics and to Proclus\u2019 returning or\nconverting love (eros epistreptikos) in the same Commentary\nabove), as also in the case of St. Paul\u2019s famous dictum \u201cI\nlive now, not I, but Christ lives in me\u201d (Gal 2:20).\nMight then such a belonging to one\u2019s beloved be characteristic\nof God, if perhaps in a different sense?\n\nDionysius continues as follows:\n\nWe must dare to say even this on behalf of the truth that the cause of\nall things himself, by his beautiful and good love for all things,\nthrough an overflowing of loving goodness, becomes outside of himself\n(exo heautou ginetai) by his providential care for all beings\nand is as it were, charmed (thelgetai) by goodness,\naffection (agapesis), and love (eros), and is\nled down (katagetai) from his place above all and\ntranscendent of all to dwell in all things in accordance with his\necstatic superessential power which does not depart from itself\n(DN 4, 13).\n\n\nThe very notion is, of course, remarkable, the notion, that is, of a\nkind of conjunction of opposites that strives to express the\ninexpressible magnitude of divine love and even to suggest power and\nvulnerability (or \u201calmost\u201d vulnerability: \u201cas it\nwere, charmed (beguiled, enchanted)\u201d), as well as the\npossibility of a genuine two-way relation between Creator and\ncreatures more in tune with Biblical thought. Yet the expression\nremains Greek, for the word thelgetai that Dionysius chooses\nis one that echoes the conclusion of Agathon\u2019s speech in the\nSymposium where Agathon praises a Love that everyone\n\u201cshould hymn fairly, sharing in the song he sings that\nenchants/charms/beguiles (thelgon) the thought\n(phronema) of all gods and human beings\u201d (197c).\nDionysius changes the context but does not really reverse the\npolarity: it is God who still\u2014like human beings\u2014is\nbeguiled by love and affection for beings and \u201cled down\u201d\nto dwell in them. Is this small detail and transposition merely\naccidental? It may well be, but in this context, the use of such a\nverb and thought is not accidental. Dionysius does not write as a\nChristian walled off from pagan thought or as if he were a Neoplatonic\nthinker in Christian disguise. Instead he provokes and delights in\nintertextuality at every point.\n\n(b) A second example is the precise nature of Dionysius\u2019\ntransposition of Neoplatonic structure. Dionysius makes concrete and\naccessible the whole world of Neoplatonism in the human, but\nsacramental life of the Church, a world of ordinary people and things\nwhose significance can only be fully realized and perfected in the\ncelestial and supercelestial world.\n\nFor Classical Neoplatonism, especially in its Plotinian form, the real\ntruths that undergird or form the origins, beginnings\n(archai) of the world of ordinary experience are the three\nhypostases or realities of soul, intellect, and the One. The\nhypostases are necessary, above all, to account for our experience of\ndegrees of unity and organization. The life-world accessible to our\nsenses is an organized, animated world, and this needs a more\nintensive degree of unity to account for it, namely, the principle of\nlife, that is, soul and all souls. But even the world of soul is a\n\u201cone and many\u201d, organized from within yet also requiring a\nprinciple of unity and organization beyond itself. And the same is\ntrue even to a higher degree of intellect. Intellect is a\n\u201cone-many\u201d, an organized world of intellects, in each of\nwhich the whole of intellect is present. Each is a sort of holographic\nreality. And because intellect is still a world despite its more\nintensive unity than soul, it requires a unity beyond intellect and\nbeyond being to organize it and to form the groundless ground of its\nown being from which it has emerged.\n\nSo (1) in Neoplatonism, there are 3 hypostases, on the one hand,\nnamely, soul, intellect, and the One, and four cosmic or hypercosmic\ndimensions, on the other: (i) the sensible world as a world of things;\n(ii) the sensible world linked by the soul to the intelligible world;\n(iii) the intelligible world itself composed of all intellects; and\nfinally (iv) the One or the Good, from which everything has come. And\n(2) while everything has its appropriate \u201cplace\u201d in this\nhypostatic hierarchy, the presence of the Good is so immediate and so\naccessible, that the presence is closer to each thing even than\nintellect or soul. This is equally true in both Plotinus and Proclus.\nFurthermore, (3) in order to explicate the derivation of each entity\nfrom what comes before it, it is not sufficient as some scholars have\nsupposed that Neoplatonism should just have multiplied intermediaries\nand indulged in an absurd proclivity for triads, such as Life, Wisdom,\nMind; Neoplatonism should rather be seen as a form of thought that\nattempts to meditate upon, read the signs in, and represent how, as\nprecisely as possible, all beings are derived from and relate to the\nOne, to examine and explicate their dependence, open-endedness, and\nradical interconnectedness without losing sight of the\nmultidimensional ordering of the universe (sensible/intelligible) and\nof the fact that even the simplicity of things that have no intellect\nor life, but only bare existence, springs from the power of the\nOne.\n\nWhat Dionysius manages to do is both to capture this spirit\nprofoundly, and, therefore, transform it, as well as to make it\nconcrete and accessible in the scriptural, sacramental, and ordinary\nexperiences of Christian practitioners. Instead of the 4 dimensions of\nthe Neoplatonic universe, Dionysius has the following: (1) the\nsensible world or Legal hierarchy, i.e., the world considered under\nthe aspect either of objective \u201cthinginess\u201d or of law,\nnamely, in the case of law, a world in which we are dependent upon\nprescriptions rather than upon any deeper understanding, a world in\nwhich the \u201cmysteries\u201d or hidden things (such as Baptism\nand the Eucharist) are mere mechanical ceremonies and the Scriptures\nare given only a literal meaning. For Dionysius (as for Plato), law is\nnecessary, but still deficient. The law of Moses, for instance,\n\u201cgave only a veiled contemplation as to enlighten without harm\nweak capacities for sight\u201d (EH 501c). Then (2) there\nfollows the ecclesiastical hierarchy, namely, the sensible world as\nthe limbs of the mystical body of Christ led by soul into the\nsignificance of the intelligible or celestial hierarchy, where the\nsymbols can begin to be read. Its mysteries, both sensible and\nintelligible, are the Scriptures and the Sacraments, its initiators\nthe priests, and its initiated the ones who receive them. From this\nperspective, Dionysius transforms Neoplatonism radically but at the\nsame time provokes entirely new possibilities in the structures he\ntransforms.\n4.2 Character of Writing\n\nWhat is the general character of Dionysius\u2019 writing and is there\nanything philosophical in it? Dionysius presents us with complex\naffirmative (kataphatic) and negative (apophatic)\nforms of theology, exploring what we can say about God, what we mean\nby our statements, discovering the necessity for us to talk too much\nabout God and to push language forms to their breaking points, and\nthen to see what we cannot say about God. Negation is important here\nat both levels, in kataphatic theology as well as in\napophatic theology. This complex theory of signification and\nits subversion is often referred to as negative theology: affirming\nour affirmations, then negating them, and then negating the negations\nto ensure that we do not make an idol out of a God about whom we know\nnothing. But it is also much more than this.\n\nDionysius is practising forms of theological meditation in\nthe sense that the earlier Church Fathers had understood this, not as\na type of objectified, academic knowledge, but rather as a more\ncomplex, intersubjective form of address, communion and contemplation.\nDionysius adopts the word theurgy, \u201cgod-work\u201d, together\nwith theology, \u201cgod-word\u201d, to describe the inmost reality\nof this practice, adopting it from the later Neoplatonist\nunderstanding of a hidden sympathy or interconnectedness between\nmaterial things and the sacred, divine significances resident in them\nby virtue of divine power. Iamblichus, for instance, had denied that\npure thought or contemplation could bring about union with the divine.\nWhat was crucial was the performance of certain ritual actions or\ntheurgy, \u201cgod-work\u201d, in the belief that one could attain\nto the divine by the incarnation of divine forces in material objects,\nstatues, or human beings through the divine power mirrored everywhere\nin the universe and in the natural sympathy of all parts, and not just\nby talking about the gods (theo-logy) or by looking at them\n(theoria). For some modern critics, Dionysius\u2019\nadaptation of pagan theurgy is analogous to calling the Christian\nsacraments \u201cmagical\u201d, which also results in the\nsubsumption of everything (morality as well as contemplation) to a\nform of magical correspondence. But Dionysius does not understand\ntheurgy in this way. For him, \u201ctheurgy is the consummation\n(sygkephalaiosis) of theology\u201d (EH 432B),\nwhich is to say that God\u2019s activity within all the orders of\nnature does not abolish nature, morality, contemplation, or science\nbut rather completes them and makes possible the divinization of human\nnature.\n\nGod\u2019s work in all things, therefore, turns the world into a\nreservoir of possibilities: at its lowest and most fragmented, it is\napparently a world of only individual, discrete things without\nsignificance, but in reality it is a world vested with signs, symbols,\nand hidden meanings as the multidimensional creation of a Triadic God.\nEven the lowest things cannot simply be despised, for even in their\ndissimilarity from the divine, they bear the capacity to signify the\ndivine more appropriately than supposedly worthier images. If we say\nGod is good, we run the risk of thinking we know entirely what we mean\nand consequently of closing off a thought that has to be radically\nopen-ended, if not altogether subverted. If we liken God to a\n\u201cworm\u201d, we subvert our own comfortable tendencies by being\nshocked into filling the image with enquiry. So the Psalmist who uses\nthe worm image hides the sacred from those who would defile\nit with a lack of understanding and yet points to the sacred\nin a new way. This constant tension or dialectic between hiddenness\nand openness pervades the whole of Dionysius\u2019 meditative\npractice of theology; and from this perspective Dionysius\u2019\npractice of writing is a complex and necessarily deceptive or\nsubversive process of reading the encoded insight (or contemplation)\nin created things in such a way that neither the perceptual beauty of\nthe material thing nor the deeper hidden beauty of the sign becomes a\ntrap, an idol, or a vanishing point but, instead, an activity that\nopens up an irresistibly beautiful world in and to God.\n\nThere are several consequences of this. First, Dionysius\u2019\nwriting is a response, a preparing of the organs of reception for the\nlove of God in praise and worship. In theology, we are learning how to\npraise, to hymn\u2014not to catalogue\u2014God. Second,\nsuch writing is dialogic and intersubjective to its core in three\nways: a) As \u201cin between\u201d teacher and pupil, dialogical\nreceptivity and transmission, open-ended in both directions,\ncharacterize its essential form; b) Even in the\ncontent of Dionysius\u2019 various works, replete as they\nare with triads (which can so easily be relegated to a Neoplatonic\nobscure penchant for providing intermediate links), this open-ended\nin-betweenness, characteristic of conversation and cooperation, is\nfundamental to the ranks of the various hierarchies. In the\nEH, for instance, in the triad catechumen (the one undergoing\npurification), sponsor or confirmed Christian (the one being\nillumined), and hierarch (the one being perfected and enlightening)\n(according to the traditional triadic form:\npurification\u2014illumination\u2014perfection), the sponsor first\nintroduces the catechumen and both sponsor and catechumen are then\nmediated by the work of the hierarch. For Dionysius at least (if not\nin the actual operation of a \u201cchurch\u201d), hierarchy is here\nnot a question of domination, but rather of a genuine open-endedness,\ntestability through interlocutor and mediator, community and\nresponsibility. c) Finally, what completes both the form and the\ncontent above all is prayer, since, for Dionysius (as for\nAnselm much later), prayer is the primary form of reverential\nphilosophical thought and receptivity, \u201cstretching ourselves\nout\u201d, as in Gregory of Nyssa, so as to be \u201clifted\nup\u201d (cf. DN 3). The most famous example of such prayer\nis the very beginning of the MT, where in the address/request\n\u201cTriad, above substance, above god, above good\u201d to\n\u201cmake our way straight to the topmost peak, beyond knowing and\nlight, of the mystical scriptures\u2014there where the simple,\nabsolute and unchangeable, mysteries of God\u2019s speaking lie\nwrapped in the darkness beyond light of secret\u2014hidden\nsilence\u201d, Timotheus, the disciple is also included, together\nwith us the readers.\n4.3 Philosophy?\n\nAll of this looks so alien to the spirit of modern philosophy that we\nmay well ask if there is anything really philosophical in\nDionysius\u2019 practice? The answer has to be affirmative, for there\nis a perfectly reasonable pattern to the whole of Dionysius\u2019\nworks. In addition, Dionysius regards his own task as a kind of\ndemonstration (apodeixis) or showing (deixai). In\nthe Divine Names, such demonstration is given a Pauline\nresonance when Dionysius states that we should hold to the scriptural\nrevelation of divine names \u201cnot in the persuasive words of human\nwisdom, but in demonstration of the power granted by the Spirit\u201d\n(DN 585b; cf. Paul 1 Cor 2\u20134). In other words,\nDionysius here sees scripture as providing the basis for a deeper\nunderstanding of attribution or predication that will lead us beyond\nour own merely human capacities. That such a demonstration involves\nthe unpacking of the symbolic, contemplative, and mystical\nsignificances of ordinary things by the aid of scriptural testimony is\nclear in the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, which again starts\nfrom Dionysius\u2019 purpose of demonstrating what the hierarchy\ncomprises; and that this includes arguments, reasons, the possibility\nof debate and even improvement upon Dionysius\u2019 demonstrations by\nhis interlocutor becomes clear too at the end of the work, when the\nliterary humility that is characteristic of his writing (cf.\nEH 568a ff.; DN 981c\u2013984a; CH 340b)\nshows itself to be philosophically justified by Dionysius\u2019\nability to set out both sides of the case for and against infant\nbaptism in the understanding that he may not fully be in possession of\nthe most complete view of the situation and that his interlocutor\nshould \u201cuse\u201d what he has said \u201cas steps\n(epanabathmois) to a higher ray of light\u201d (EH\n568d\u2013569a). This is a thought couched in terms very reminiscent\nof Socrates\u2019 wish in the Republic to subvert or destroy\nhypotheses and use them as stepping stones to something better, and it\nis also a thought not unworthy of Wittgenstein\u2019s similar view at\nthe end of the Tractatus. The words immediately following\nmake clear the connection between charity of interpretation,\nopen-endedness and demonstration: \u201cBe generous with me then, my\ndear friend,\u2026 and show (deixon) to my eyes that more\nbeautiful and unified beauty which you may be able to see\u201d.\nDemonstration in this sense, then, includes much of what we might\nconsider to be properly philosophical, but at root it is also a form\nof \u201cdivine reading\u201d (lectio divina, or\nmeditative, prayerful reading) of nature and word, a receptive\nrecognition as a kind of method or making one\u2019s way \u201cto\nhear the sacred words as receptively as possible, to be open to the\ndivine workings of God, to clear an uplifting path\n(hodopoiesis) toward that inheritance that awaits us in\nheaven, and to accept our most divine and sacred regeneration\u201d\n(EH 392a).\n5. Afterlife: Significance and Influence\n\nIn sum, Dionysius represents the instantaneous resonances, possible in\nunusual circumstances, between forms of thought and practice that may\nat first sight appear entirely divergent. He is therefore in some\nrespects a dangerous thinker, yet at the same time a forger of new\npossibilities:\n\nPartly because as a Christian he cannot accept at face value the\nNeoplatonic view of the One as excluding trinity, Dionysius forges a\nnew way of thinking about God by linking beyond-beingness with\nunrestricted being and by combining in God\u2019s transcendent love\nboth power and a kind of hyperessential, erotic vulnerability. In the\nfirst instance, he provides a fruitful link between philosophies based\nupon a transcendent principle beyond being (for example, the Good) and\nphilosophies of being, and in the second instance he suggests a loving\nGod whom, in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, it makes sense to address\nin prayer. At the same time, however, this standpoint leaves room,\nfrom a modern viewpoint particularly, for interreligious dialogue\nsince, while it is certainly a Christian view, it also remains\nradically open-ended.\nHe also succeeds in transposing Pagan Neoplatonism into a complete\nChristian theology, from the Trinity and the angelic world through the\nincarnation and redemption to the sacramental life and orders of the\nChurch, and extending to the old Law, and provides not only a symbolic\nand mystical explanation, but a profound reconsideration of the\nimportance of liturgical practice as a response to both the hidden and\nthe more manifest divine workings of grace in scripture, ritual,\nmorality, law and even material things.\nTogether with scripture, the Fathers, and the entire ancient\ntradition, he provides a framework and a vocabulary for ordinary\nspirituality as well as mystical practice, especially for describing\nthe approach of the soul through inactivity of all knowledge to a\nstate of unification with God \u201cin the brilliant darkness of a\nhidden silence\u201d (MT 1); and his complex negative\ntheology transmits a theory of signification that in many ways is so\nself-subversive and necessarily deceptive at each level (both\nkataphatic and apophatic) that for future\ngenerations after his own time it will hardly be possible to translate\nhis works without also writing commentaries upon them.\nIn addition, Dionysius\u2019 view of the visible created universe\nwas to have a marked influence for two reasons, first, because his\nvivid sense of the aesthetic and imaginative beauty of the sensible\nuniverse, pervaded from the perspective of divine beauty by\ninterrelatedness and harmony (see esp. DN 7), came to inspire\nAbbot Suger\u2019s program for a new architecture, the Gothic\ncathedral, and, second, because Dionysius also took account of\nugliness, defect, resistance, and evil by his theory of evil as\nprivation and non-being, a theory adopted from Plotinus (with\nsignificant changes) and Proclus and destined to have further\ninfluence upon Aquinas in medieval times and Ficino in the\nRenaissance.\n\n\nFor the long commentary tradition, from John of Scythopolis to Aquinas\nand Ficino, see bibliography 2 below. St. Gregory the Great refers to\nDionysius in his own commentary on the angels and probably had the\ncomplete works at Rome. But the study of Dionysius did not take off in\nthe Latin West until the Byzantine emperor Michael the Stammerer sent\na copy of the Dionysian corpus as a gift to the Frankish king Louis\nthe Pious in 827. This copy served as the source of the first\ntranslations of Dionysius into Latin. The first translation, made\naround 838 by Hilduin, abbot of a monastery near Paris (who identified\nDionysius not only as St. Dionysius the Areopagite but also as the\nfirst bishop of Paris), was so unintelligible that Charles II asked\nthe great Irish philosopher, John Scottus Eriugena, to make a new\ntranslation that he completed in 862 and that was subsequently revised\nwith clarifications in 875. The influence of Dionysius is profound in\nEriugena\u2019s own thought as it would be later in the Franciscan\ntradition (especially Grosseteste and Bonaventure) and also to a\nlesser extent in the Dominican (both Albert and Aquinas wrote\ncommentaries). In fact, the abiding-procession-return triad may be\nsaid to form the essential structure of Aquinas\u2019 unfinished\nmasterpiece, the Summa Theologica. The influence of\nDionysius\u2019 ideas pervades not only the Italian and English\nRenaissance, but also the Rhineland mystical writers, such as Meister\nEckhart (d. 1327), Tauler (d. 1361), Ruysbroeck (d. 1381), Gerson (d.\n1429), and later Denis the Carthusian (d. 1471) and Nicholas of Cusa\n(d. 1464) (whose work On Learned Ignorance owes a debt to\nDionysius\u2019 agnosia or unknowingness, as does also the\nanonymous author of the Cloud of Unknowing) and the great\nSpanish mystics, for example, St. John of the Cross (d. 1591). In the\nGreek East, Dionysius\u2019 On the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy\ninspired a series of liturgical commentaries, beginning with the\nMystagogy of Maximus the Confessor (d. 662) and continuing\nwith works by Germanus of Constantinople (d. 733) and Nicholas\nCabasilas (d. 1390). Dionysius played a major role in the Palamite\ncontroversy of the 14th century, cited both by Gregory Palamas (d.\n1359) and by his opponents. In the modern world, Dionysius has\nreceived less attention, though he is of some importance for 19th\ncentury German Idealist thought and also to a lesser extent for\nEnglish and American Romanticism. In the so-called\n\u201cpostmodern\u201d world, however, two thinkers who have written\nabout Dionysius with great insight are Jean-Luc Marion and Jacques\nDerrida. Derrida, in particular, has been one of the few contemporary\nphilosophical thinkers, if not the only one, to realize the importance\nof Dionysius in relation to deconstruction (a term he does not use\nhimself) and to explore the complex nature of prayer, address, and\ndenial in the context of the necessarily deceptive and open-ended\npossibilities of negative theology.\n6.
