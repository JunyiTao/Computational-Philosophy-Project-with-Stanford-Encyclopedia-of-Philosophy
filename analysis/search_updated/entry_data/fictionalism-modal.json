    "preamble": "\n\nQuestions about necessity (or what has to be, or what cannot be\notherwise) and possibility (or what can be, or what could be\notherwise) are questions about modality.\nFictionalism is an approach to theoretical matters in a given\narea which treats the claims in that area as being in some sense\nanalogous to fictional claims: claims we do not literally accept at\nface value, but which we nevertheless think serve some useful\nfunction. However, despite its name, \u201cModal Fictionalism\u201d\nin its usual manifestations is not primarily fictionalism about claims\nof necessity and possibility, but rather a fictionalist approach to\nclaims about possible worlds. (For instance, modal fictionalism is not\nnormally fictionalist about the claim that \u201cit is possible that\nthere be a species of tail-less kangaroo\u201d, but rather about the\nclaim that \u201cthere is a possible world in which there is a\nspecies of tail-less kangaroo\u201d.) The practice of taking possible\nworlds to be merely convenient fictions, or of treating talk about\npossible worlds as being useful without being literally correct, is\nquite common in philosophical circles. It is only recently, however,\nthat philosophers have seriously examined the implications of taking\npossible worlds to be merely fictional objects, like Sherlock Holmes\nor a frictionless surface. \n\nTheories employing possible worlds terminology have been found to be\nvery useful in philosophy, e.g. when engaging in thought experiments;\ndistinguishing various claims in metaphysics, or in the philosophy of\nlanguage, mind, knowledge or ethics; and in areas other than\nphilosophy, like linguistics, modal logic, and probability theory.\nMany have found the status of these worlds and their contents to be\npuzzling, to say the least. What are they? Where, if anywhere, are\nthey supposed to be? How are we supposed to discover facts about them?\nIsn\u2019t it extravagant to believe that just because a situation is\npossible, it must in some sense exist? Modal fictionalists take\ntheories committed to the existence of possible worlds, merely\nhypothetical situations, non-actual but possible objects etc. to be\nstrictly and literally false, and so they avoid the problems of\nbelieving in possible worlds. Nevertheless, they claim, they can enjoy\nthe benefits of using these seemingly problematic theories.\n\nModal fictionalism should be of interest to those concerned with the\nmetaphysics of modality, since theories committed to the literal\nexistence of possible worlds (and, even more worryingly, the literal\nexistence of merely possible objects \u2018contained\u2019 in these\nworlds) come at a cost, both to economy and to many people\u2019s\nintuitions. But it is, or should be, of wider interest as well, since\nit is one of the most discussed applications of a fictionalist\ntreatment of abstract objects, along with mathematical fictionalism.\nLessons learned in the case of modal fictionalism can hopefully be\napplied to other areas in which we may wish to evade literal\ntheoretical commitments. Modal fictionalism continues to be an active\ntopic of research and debate, and as well as dozens of papers\nsupporting or criticising modal fictionalism, there is even a\npublished monograph on the topic (Warzoszczak\n 2014).\n\nI shall begin by discussing the motivation for modal fictionalism, and\ndistinguishing some of its varieties. Next, I shall discuss what\nconnection there might be between \u201cfictionalism\u201d and\ntreatments of paradigmatic fictions. I shall then discuss the debate\nabout the \u201cBrock/Rosen objection\u201d and a problem raised by\nBob Hale, both of which turn on technical problems concerning modal\nclaims about the status of the modal fiction. Finally, in section 4,\nother concerns about modal fictionalism will be discussed.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Types of Modal Fictionalism\n\nModal fictionalists often focus on the claim that possible worlds are\nmerely fictional entities, and apparent commitment to possible worlds\nis to be explained in the same sort of way that apparent commitment to\nideal gases or frictionless surfaces is to be explained. Rosen 1990\nand others have formulated modal fictionalism as a theory that takes\ntalk of possible worlds to be on a par with talk about\nparadigmatically fictional objects, e.g., Sherlock Holmes\n(\u201cThere is a (non-actual) possible world at which there are blue\nswans\u201d is to be understood on the model of \u201cThere is a\nbrilliant detective at 221b Baker Street\u201d, in Rosen\u2019s\nexample). This goes with an at least partial account of how we are to\ntreat paradigmatically fictional claims: that they are, literally and\nstrictly speaking, false. The literal truth, according to modal\nfictionalists, is that there are no merely possible worlds (or merely\npossible situations, or outcomes), and there are no merely possible\nobjects. Strictly and literally speaking, there is no sculpture that I\nspent this morning making, though there could have been. When the\nflipped coin comes down heads, there is strictly speaking no outcome\nof that very throw in which it comes down tails.\n\nWhat is literally true, however, is that according to the modal\nfiction, or according to the fiction of possible worlds\nthere is a (merely possible) sculpture I could have spent this morning\nmaking, and there is an (unactualised) outcome of the toss in which\nthe coin came down tails. What is said in talk about merely possible\nworlds and merely possible objects is generally literally false, but\nthe slightly more longwinded talk about what is true according to the\nfiction of possible worlds is literally true. One might think (as\nHinckfuss 1993 does) that talk about possible worlds is (or should be)\ngoverned by implicit presuppositions known to be false so that what is\nsaid in the language of possible worlds does not commit one\nto the existence of possible worlds, but only to some more economical\nproposition: something of the kind \u201cif there were possible\nworlds of such-and-such a sort, then \u2026\u201d, or \u201cgiven\nthe presupposition that there are possible worlds, \u2026\u201d. Or\nyou might have some other account of the functioning of talk about\npossible worlds: Nolt 1986 suggests we should take typical\n\u201cpossibilistic discourse\u201d to be a game of make-believe\n(Nolt 1986, p. 440), and while Nolt does not tell us specifically what\ntheory of make-believe he has in mind, there are many theories of\nmake-believe (most famously Walton 1990) that might be employed by a\nmodal fictionalist to explain the behaviour of our typical utterances\nabout possible worlds. \u00a0Stephen Yablo (Yablo 1996) is one person\nwho employs Walton\u2019s theory in his fictionalism (or, as he\nprefers in Yablo 2001, figuralism) about possible worlds.\n\nThe main benefit which a fictional approach to possible worlds offers\nis, of course, the advantage of using the language of possible worlds,\nwithout the stiff ontological cost of literal commitment to such\nworlds. It is an especially tempting account of merely possible\nobjects (like blue swans, or dragons, or the Holy New Zealand Empire):\neven those who accept some abstractionist account of possible worlds\n(see van Inwagen 1986) might well be reluctant to accept the literal\nexistence of their contents. After all, it is often thought that the\ndistinguishing mark of merely possible objects is that they\ndo not actually exist.\n\nCentral to fictionalist treatments of possible worlds are\nbiconditionals connecting truths about necessity and possibility, on\nthe one hand, and the contents of the modal fiction, on the other.\nCentral biconditionals will be all the instances of the following\nschemas (where P expresses a proposition):\n\nPossibly P iff according to the fiction of possible worlds,\nP is true at some possible world.\n\n\nNecessarily P iff according to the fiction of possible\nworlds, P is true at all possible worlds.\n\n\nEither schema will be adequate to yield the other, given the standard\ninter-definition of possibility and necessity, provided enough logical\nmachinery is available for reasoning within the scope of the\n\u201caccording to the fiction\u201d operator. As a matter of fact,\nthe above is a simplification, since, according to Rosen (1990, p.\n335), what is true according to the fiction of possible worlds may be\nonly a proposition connected with P: the paraphrase of\nP into the language of possible worlds. In general, for\nRosen, this will be the analysis of P in Lewis\u2019s theory\nof possible worlds. Rosen states the form of the fictionalist\nbiconditionals at its most general as:\n\nP iff according to PW, P*.\n\n\nwhere \u201cPW\u201d is the fiction of possible worlds, P\nis any proposition, and P* is its possible-worlds\n\u201cparaphrase\u201d (Rosen 1990, p. 335). In simple cases the\nabove biconditionals will do as they are: for example,\n\nPossibly, pigs fly iff according to the fiction of possible worlds (or\naccording to PW), at some possible world, pigs fly.\n\n\nIn less straightforward cases, however, the proposition expressed by\nP* may have to differ from that expressed by\n P.[1]\n Fictionalists may also employ other biconditionals when constructing\ntheir fiction \u2014 one example is a biconditional to ensure that\nevery proposition that is (really) true is according to the fiction\ntrue in the actual\n world.[2]\n A modal fiction may require more contents than those yielded by such\nbiconditionals: what other contents the fiction of possible worlds\nmight contain is an important question, and one unsurprisingly which\ndifferent modal fictionalists will answer differently.\n1.1 The Contents of The Fiction of Possible Worlds\n\nMany fictionalists are far from explicit about exactly what the\ncontent of the fiction of possible worlds is to be. (Often they are\nalso silent on the pressing issue of how one would justify one fiction\nrather than another: but more on this in section 4). Two explicit\nproposals were made in 1989 and 1990 about which fiction to use.\nGideon Rosen\u2019s 1990 proposed using a slightly modified version\nof David Lewis\u2019s 1986 theory of possible worlds as the modal\nfiction. The theory had been proposed by Lewis as the literal truth,\nbut by treating it as a mere fiction Rosen provided a ready-made story\nabout possible worlds, their extent and nature. The other proposal was\nthat of D.M. Armstrong\u2019s 1989. Armstrong proposed a\n\u201ctwo-step\u201d fiction, according to which there was a\n\u201cgreat fiction\u201d, which asserted the existence of a lot of\n\u201clittle fictions\u201d, each of which completely described a\npossible world. Armstrong resisted identifying these complete\ndescriptions of ways things could be with the possible worlds, as an\nabstractionist might, since Armstrong believed that worlds are\nsupposed to be objects like our cosmos, rather than descriptions,\nproperties, or other such abstract objects. Armstrong employed the two\nstage fiction, on the other hand, because he held that it is true at\neach world that it is the only world, and if the fiction were of a\nLewisian pluriverse each world would (according to the fiction) be\nsuch that it was one of many worlds. In this respect, though Armstrong\nspells out the concern in quite a different manner, it can be seen as\nan anticipation of the Brock/Rosen objection (see section 3, below).\nIn both the theories of Armstrong and Rosen the \u201cworlds\u201d\nin the story are thought to be \u2018concrete\u2019 cosmoi, like our\n own.[3]\n\n\nA third systematic attempt to specify something like a modal fiction\nis worth noting here. Theodore Sider defends an \u201cersatz\npluriverse\u201d view in Sider 2002, according to which possible\nworlds talk should be understood as talk about what is true according\nto what is true according to a pluriverse sentence that Sider\nspecifies. Sider constructs this sentence, that simultaneously\ndescribes all the possible worlds and their relationships, using a\nrange of constraints including the constraint that de dicto necessity\nclaims that are in fact true are true of all the worlds of the\ndescribed pluriverse. Sider distinguishes his view from Rosen-style\nmodal fictionalism, particularly because Sider thinks that the\n\u201caccording to\u201d he needs should not be understood as the\nsort of \u201caccording to the fiction\u201d operator he takes\nRosen\u2019s to be. So while Sider\u2019s view probably should not\nbe classed as a variety of modal fictionalism, it is a close cousin.\nBerit Brogaard argues that Sider\u2019s view is inferior to her\npreferred form of modal fictionalism in Brogaard 2006. \n\nFor any set of principles governing the fiction of possible worlds,\nthe question obviously arises as to why that set should be chosen.\nAlternatively, there are many stories we could tell about other worlds\n(whether they are cosmoi or fictional abstract objects), and the\nquestion arises as to why one rather than any other be chosen to be\nthe modal fiction. (One could of course be more pluralist\nthan this, and allow that different fictions are suitable for\ndifferent purposes. The relativised question may still be asked,\nhowever: why this fiction, rather than any other, for\nthis particular purpose?). This task of selecting and\njustifying one or more particular stories about worlds will be one of\nthe challenges discussed in section 4. However, the next distinction\nto be discussed makes a big difference to what sort of answer to this\nquestion will be acceptable.\n1.2 Strong vs. Timid\n\nThis next distinction concerns the role the modal fiction is to play\nin the theory. Is the fiction of possible worlds intended to provide\nan explanation of the applicability modal vocabulary, or not? The view\nthat the truth of modal claims depends on, or is to be explained by,\nthe contents of the fiction of possible worlds is often called\n\u201cstrong modal fictionalism\u201d, following Rosen\u2019s\ndescription of such a view (Rosen 1990, p. 354, Nolan 1997a). The view\nthat modal truth does not depend on the contents of the modal fiction\n(and usually, that what the contents of the modal fiction are depends\non the modal truth), on the other hand, is known as \u201ctimid modal\nfictionalism\u201d, again following Rosen (Rosen 1990, p. 354).\n\nBoth the view put forward by Armstrong 1989 and the primary view\ndiscussed (but not endorsed) by Rosen 1990 seem to have been\nfictionalisms of the \u2018strong\u2019 kind (see Nolan 1997a, p.\n263). \u2018Timid\u2019 fictionalism about possible worlds is also\nmentioned by Rosen 1990, and has been endorsed in passing by Field\n(1989, p. 41, 86). Sider 2002 is also on the \u2018timid\u2019 side,\nnot seeking an analysis at least of basic de dicto necessity. A modal\nfictionalist theory which sees the fiction of possible worlds as\nproviding the resources for an analysis of modal statements would of\ncourse do important theoretical work: since the analysis of claims\ninvolving modal operators is among the most controversial and\ndifficult issues in metaphysics. The downside is that strong modal\nfictionalism seems to face serious objections: see section 4. \n\nApart from any objections that might be leveled at strong modal\nfictionalism, the advocate of this variety of modal fictionalism faces\nthe challenge of stating the contents of the modal fiction without\nrelying on modal notions in a way that would make the explanation of\nthose modal notions circular. Since the fiction explains the truth of\nmodal claims, explaining the content of the modal fiction by reference\nto modal claims would be circular (e.g., by stipulating that all of\nthe propositions which are necessary hold in all worlds, or that\nobjects have in all worlds in which they exist the properties which\nthey in fact have essentially). Stating, in non-modal terms, general\nprinciples about possible worlds that would enable one to determine,\nwhen presented with a proposition, whether it holds at all worlds, at\nsome but not others, or none, is a difficult and controversial matter.\nPlausibly, a strong modal fictionalist will owe us such a non-modal\nspecification of the contents of the modal fiction, if our\nunderstanding of the contents of the modal fiction is to allow us a\nuseful method of assessing the truth of modal claims. Furthermore the\nstrong modal fictionalist seems committed to there being a\nfact of the matter about the content of the modal fiction which is not\nitself to be explained or analysed in terms of further modal facts of\nthe matter. \n\nOne particularly pressing instance of this difficulty (noted e.g., by\nRosen 1990, p. 344) is the problem of how to understand the\n\u201caccording to the fiction of possible worlds\u2026\u201d\noperator. Natural initial glosses, as Rosen points out, include: \n\nIf PW were true, then P would be true; If we suppose PW,\nP follows; It would be impossible for PW to be true without\nP being true as well. (Rosen 1990, p. 344)\n\n\nThe problem is that these seem modal. Rosen offers several possible\nresponses the fictionalist could make to this problem. He could admit\nthat his theory does indeed contain a modal primitive, but claim\nnevertheless that it is some sort of advance in analysis, reducing all\nmodal primitives to one. (Though as Rosen says, \u201cAccording to\nthe fiction of possible worlds\u201d seems like a very odd\nprimitive.) Or he could instead attempt to spell out the prefix in a\nnon-modal way. This has not to date been attempted by many avowed\nmodal fictionalists, but is one of the many tasks facing a modal\nfictionalist who sees the invocation of the fiction as the method for\nanalysing or explaining modality.\n\nIf the modal fictionalist were only timid, on the other hand, then the\nfictionalist biconditional could be used to generate a great deal of\nthe content of the modal fiction: whether or not the fiction claims\nthat a given proposition is true in all possible worlds (or all\naccessible worlds) depends on whether that proposition is indeed\nnecessarily true; whether or not a proposition is true at some world\n(or some accessible world) depends on whether it is possibly true; and\nso on. Furthermore, an analysis of truth in fiction in terms of some\nmodal notion (whether a counterfactual conditional, strict\nimplication, or whatever) would not make the account circular, since\nanalysing modal discourse would be no part of the purpose of the\nfictional machinery. One recent worked-out modal fictionalist approach\nwhich explicitly analyses the relevant \u201caccording to the modal\nfiction\u201d operator in terms of modal operators is Divers 1999b.\nAmong other benefits, Divers argues that this sort of definition\nenables one to prove a \u201cmodal safety result\u201d: that when we\nhave two modal claims A and B, and we have the\npossible-worlds-analogues of the two modal claims (call them\nA* and B* respectively), \u201cNecessarily, if\nB* is a consequence of A* then B is a\nconsequence of A\u201d (Divers 1999b, p. 330). Such a safety\nresult would be welcome, for it would provide the guarantee we needed\nthat \u201cdetouring\u201d in our reasoning through claims like\nA* and B* would not lead us astray when trying to\ndetermine whether B followed from A. \n\nA drawback of timid modal fictionalism is that it leaves the important\nissue of a theory of modality to one side. Without some other positive\nstory, even if it were primitivism about modality, it might seem that\nit would be difficult to motivate timid fictionalism over agnosticism\nabout the status of possible worlds. In this context, the agnostic\noption would be to accept that the story of possible worlds is at\nleast a useful fiction, but for all we know it may be that some theory\nthat explains possibility in terms of possible worlds is true as well.\nMany of the leading candidates for the analysis of modal claims are\nthose that explain the truth of modal claims in terms of the literal\nexistence and nature of possible worlds, so without a positive\nalternative story, it might seem premature to reject this style of\nexplanation of modality. However, the project of endorsing\nfictionalism about possible worlds and possible objects without\nendorsing the further claim that this fiction provides the material to\nexplain or analyse our modal notions, while in some ways less\nphilosophically interesting than its strong cousin, is proportionally\nless open to serious objections. \n1.3 Normative vs. Descriptive\n\nModal fictionalism can be interpreted as a descriptive theory of what\nour talk in fact amounts to, or as a normative proposal for how we\nshould use talk of possible worlds. (In the terminology of Burgess and\nRosen 1997, this is the distinction between a\n\u201chermeneutic\u201d construal of modal fictionalism and a\n\u201crevolutionary\u201d construal of modal fictionalism). If the\ntheory is that in fact we take possible worlds to be no more than\nconvenient fictions, and, in the case of strong modal fictionalism,\nthat facts about the content and nature of the fiction of possible\nworlds explain and/or provide the basis of the analysis of our modal\nlocutions, then the theory is descriptive. This sociological claim\nthat most philosophers who talk about possible worlds take this talk\nto be analogous to talk of e.g., ideal gases is a dubious one: my own\nimpression is that modal fictionalism is a minority view amongst those\nphilosophers who work extensively on the philosophy of possible worlds\nand its applications, though perhaps fictionalism might be the\nmajority view when all who have opinions on possible worlds are taken\ninto account.\n\nIn any case, fictionalism about possible worlds might be important\neven if the descriptive version is incorrect. A normative claim to the\neffect that talk of possible worlds ought to be interpreted\nas merely fictional discourse, or the corresponding strong\nfictionalist claim that modal statements ought to be\nreinterpreted so as to be explained or analysed as statements about\nthe content of the fiction of possible worlds, might be found\nattractive even if it were conceded that most people who employed the\ndiscourse were not talking fictively, or that the actual commitments\nof the folk and most philosophers who employ everyday modal idiom are\nto be cashed out in some other way (e.g., as implicit commitment to\nsome false theory, perhaps one which took modal statements to have\ntruth conditions in terms of an objective modal reality). \n\nThe two questions, of whether the fictionalist theory is supposed to\ndescribe our current practice, and whether it is supposed to describe\na practice we should adopt instead of realism, are independent. Two\npeople could agree that normal usage of possible-worlds talk is not\nintended literally, but disagree about whether we should accept the\nliteral existence of possible worlds (that is, they could be\ndescriptive fictionalists while disagreeing about the normative\nquestion), and likewise two people could be normative fictionalists,\nand claim that we should take ordinary possible worlds talk as being\nonly fictionally true or appropriate, while disagreeing about whether\nin fact current usage reflects this fictionalism or instead reveals\nnon-fictionalist commitments among the users of the vocabulary. (This\nindependence may be overlooked if we employ Burgess and Rosen\u2019s\nvocabulary, which suggests that fictionalists face a binary choice of\na \u201chermeneutic\u201d fictionalist approach or a\n\u201crevisionary\u201d approach.) \n\nUnfortunately, modal fictionalists have often not been explicit about\nwhether their theory is to be an analysis of the possible-worlds talk\nand perhaps modal discourse which is actually employed, or a normative\nsuggestion about how we might move to a superior theory. It is to be\nhoped that those seeking to provide a fully worked out modal\nfictionalist position would make more explicit the status of their\nproposal. \n1.4 Fictionalism about Modality and Modal Fictionalism\n\nSo far, it has been taken for granted that the modal fictionalist\ntreats ordinary modal claims as sometimes literally true, and it is\nonly claims about possible worlds and their contents which the modal\nfictionalist will wish to claim are literally false, but true\naccording to a story. A more radical modal fictionalism is possible:\none in which modal claims themselves (such as the claim that there\ncould have been blue swans, or that necessarily, everything is\nself-identical) are not literally true, but only true according to a\nfiction. (In Nolan 1997a I called a version of modal fictionalism\nwhich took both claims about possible worlds and modal claims to be\ntrue only according to fictions broad modal\nfictionalism.)\n\nSuch extended fictionalism about modality could, I think, come in two\nmain varieties. One would maintain that modal operators (and\nassociated pieces of language like essential predication,\ncounterfactual conditionals, and perhaps other things like assignments\nof probabilities) lacked literal application: that all statements\nprefixed with a modal operator were either uniformly literally\ntruthvalueless or uniformly literally false. This faces several\nimmediate formal difficulties, given the usual characterisation of the\nmodal\n operators.[4]\n\n\nA less blanket rejection of modality might only insist on the\nfalsehood of some modal claims: think of the analogy of a moral\nnihilist who rejects only \u201cpositive\u201d moral claims, such as\nthat taking property without permission is wrong, or that it is good\nto help the ill, but accepts that it is not wrong to take property\nwithout permission (since nothing is wrong) and that it is not good to\nhelp the ill (since nothing is good). This fictionalist about modality\nmight reject the literal truth of all claims about necessity, for\nexample (and, in virtue of the interdefinition, accept the literal\ntruth of all possibility claims). Or she might assert as little as is\nneeded to preserve the basic modal inferences from actuality: for\nexample, every true P is possibly true, and actually true,\nbut this is the limit of literal modal truth. This would be more\nanalogous to the fictionalist about possible worlds who nevertheless\nthinks that there is one possible world \u2014 the actual, and one\ncollection of possible objects \u2014 the actual objects. \n\nFictionalism of this sort extending to modal discourse as well should\nbe a position worthy of investigation by those attracted to\nfictionalist strategies and mistrustful of modality. Since it seems to\nlack contemporary advocates, however, it shall not be dwelled upon\n here.[5]\n\n1.5 Further Extensions\n\nModal fictionalism has traditionally been conceived as fictionalism\nabout possible worlds, and implicitly also about their contents. One\nnatural way to extend modal fictionalism so understood is to admit\nimpossible worlds as well. Use of a fiction of impossible worlds is\nunlikely to seem too extravagant for many modal fictionalists, but it\nmight also provide a mechanism for non-fictionalists about possible\nworlds to talk of impossible worlds without the extra theoretical\ncosts they fear. So there is a partially fictionalist option of being\na realist of some stripe about possible worlds but a fictionalist\nabout impossible worlds (and perhaps other situations, e.g.,\nincomplete or underdetermined ones). This partial fictionalism will\nface some of the same sorts of questions, and employ the same sorts of\nstrategies, as modal fictionalism about possible worlds.\n\nAnother mixed strategy is rarely explicitly endorsed, though it may be\nimplicit in many theorists\u2019 talk. By far the majority of\nrealists about possible worlds take them to be abstract objects of\nsome sort: sets of sentences or propositions, uninstantiated\nworld-properties, unactualised maximal facts, or perhaps even as\nsui generis simples. However, their approach to merely possible\nobjects is often less explicitly spelled out. As well as possible\nworlds, merely possible objects such as blue swans, my counterparts,\nNewtonian masses, XYZ, and many others are discussed and quantified\nover. Some abstractionists will wish to identify such merely possible\nobjects with actual abstract objects \u2014 perhaps uninstantiated\nproperties that are less than world-properties, descriptions of parts\nof worlds, set-theoretic representatives, or whatever. But many more\nwill not. This is for at least three reasons. The first is the\nintuition, never entirely quelled, that a merely possible blue swan\nshould be blue and a swan. Abstract objects are\nrarely, if ever, either. The second is that it is often thought that\nthe whole point about merely possible objects is that they do not\nexist, but might have. Admitting their literal existence by\nidentifying them with actual existing abstract objects will go against\nthe grain for many. Finally, many theories of possible worlds lack\nobvious candidates to play the roles of merely possible objects. This\nis most obvious for those theories that take possible worlds to be\nsimples, but it is also not straightforward to divide a set of\npropositions into \u201cobject shaped\u201d components, or to\ndistinguish one merely possible object from its duplicates if one\nidentifies worlds with world-properties, and furthermore seeks to\ndivide these up to yield merely possible less-than-world-sized\nobjects. Fictionalism about merely possible objects is an\nunderappreciated theory, and should perhaps recommend itself to more\nabstractionists about possible worlds than it in fact does.\n2. Fictionalism in Context\n2.1 Modal Fictionalism and Fiction\n\nA theory that holds that possible worlds are to be treated as having\nthe status of fictional objects immediately gives rise to questions\nabout the status of fictions and fictional objects more generally. The\nissue of how to understand the \u201caccording to the\nfiction\u2026\u201d operator has already been mentioned. Other\nissues in the treatment of fiction are the question of whether\n\u201ctheoretical\u201d fictions are to be seen in the same light as\nliterary fictions, and the question of what ontological status\nfictions possess.\n\nThere is room in principle to distinguish claims about\nparadigmatically fictional characters (like Sherlock Holmes or\nhobbits) from the treatment one wishes to apply to claims which serve\nuseful theoretical purposes but which are not to be taken literally,\nor at least not at face value: to distinguish \u201cfabulous\u201d\nand \u201cfictional\u201d entities, to use Bentham\u2019s not\nentirely perspicuous terminology (Bentham 1959). One might wish to do\nthis, for example, if one thought that paradigmatic story-telling\nconsisted of utterances that were not truth-apt (not anyway through\nthe same mechanism as ordinary utterances), while claims about, say,\nideal gases were better construed as standard sorts of assertions that\nwere literally false. In practice, however, recent modal fictionalism\ndiscussions have proceeded as if the theory holds that possible worlds\nare fictional in the fullest sense of the word.\n\nThe ontological status of fictions is an important issue to settle if\nwe are to determine whether modal fictionalism is any advance\nmetaphysically on rival realist theories of possible worlds. On pain\nof circularity, the ontology of fiction, as conceived by the\nfictionalist, had best not include possible worlds (as the ontology of\nfiction offered in Lewis 1978 does), but there are other sources of\nconcern. Rosen points out that fictionalists must believe in fictions,\nstories, theories, or somesuch, and that if these are construed as\nabstract objects, they will not be philosophically uncontroversial\n(Rosen 1990, p. 338). Rosen argues that belief in abstract objects\nlike stories and theories is less revisionary than belief in Lewisian\npossible worlds, at least. However, it is hardly clear that an\nontology of abstract representational entities is any more or less\nobjectionable than the ontology of abstractionist theories of possible\nworlds. (Lycan 1993, p. 16, Nolan 1997a, pp. 271\u2013273).\nAlternatively, fictionalists could commit themselves to more concrete,\n\u201cnominalistically respectable\u201d fictions only: the relevant\nfictions or theories of possible worlds might be conceived of only as\nink-marks on pieces of paper, or information states inside brains, or\nperhaps as some amalgam of these and other actual, concrete ontology.\nThis approach is not problem-free either (see section 4): it is far\nfrom clear that it will serve as a basis for paradigm fictions, let\nalone be enough to explain possible worlds.\n3. Technical Problems\n\nThere are a variety of technical objections to modal fictionalism, and\nif these objections succeeded they would derail specific proposals\nlike that of Rosen 1990 and perhaps cause difficulties for modal\nfictionalism in general. The most discussed of these objections is the\nBrock/Rosen objection, an objection to the theory of Rosen 1990,\npublished independently in Brock 1993 and Rosen 1993. (In the case of\nRosen 1993, a variety was also leveled at the fictionalism of\nArmstrong 1989).\n3.1 The Brock/Rosen Objection\n\nThe reader is advised to consult Brock 1993 and Rosen 1993 for an\nexact statement of their objections, but in essence the problem arises\nwhen we consider the modal status of certain claims about possible\nworlds themselves. One of the principal fictionalist biconditionals,\nas we have seen, is the biconditional connecting necessary truths and\nwhat the fiction asserts about all possible worlds:\n\nNecessarily P iff, according to the modal fiction, at all\nworlds, P*,\n\n\nwhere P* is the possible-worlds paraphrase of P.\nAccording to the fiction employed by Rosen 1990 (i.e. the theory which\nDavid Lewis offers as fact), there are many co-existing concrete\npossible worlds \u2014 each one its own cosmos. Furthermore, this\nclaim is true at any of these possible worlds. So, according to the\nmodal fiction, at all worlds it is true that there are many other\npossible worlds. However, it follows from the biconditional that\nsince, according to the modal fiction, at all worlds, there are many\npossible worlds, it follows that necessarily, there are many possible\nworlds. Since necessarily P implies P, it follows\nthat there are (literally!) many possible worlds. But the whole point\nof modal fictionalism was to deny (or at least avoid asserting) that\nthere were many possible worlds. So modal fictionalism, at least of\nthe variety described, is self-refuting.\n\nSo the objection goes. (The version presented above is Brock\u2019s\nfrom Brock 1993 \u2014 for some of the detail of Rosen\u2019s\nargument, see below or Rosen 1993.) Two direct responses have been\noffered to this problem in the literature. The first, by Peter Menzies\nand Philip Pettit (Menzies and Pettit 1994), conceded that the\nobjection \u201cis decisive against the letter of the Rosen\nproposal\u201d (p. 29), and sought to provide modified fictionalist\nbiconditionals to produce a modal fictionalist theory which would not\nbe susceptible to the Brock/Rosen objection. Nolan and\nO\u2019Leary-Hawthorne 1996 produced a version of the Brock/Rosen\nobjection which they believed circumvented the Menzies and Pettit\nsolution offered in section 3 of Menzies and Pettit\u2019s paper.\nSection 5 of Menzies and Pettit gave another translation scheme meant\nto avoid the Brock/Rosen objection; it is argued in the following\nsupplementary document that this scheme too is unsatisfactory.\n\n [A Persisting Problem For Fictionalism About Possible Worlds]\n \n\nI shall not dwell on the details of the Menzies/Pettit position, since\nthe other response to the Brock/Rosen objection has been more\ninfluential: the response of Noonan 1994. Noonan claims that the\nBrock/Rosen objection is not even successful against the letter of the\noriginal proposal in Rosen 1990 (Noonan 1994, p. 133). He argues that\ncareful attention to the procedures actually given by Lewis (Lewis\n1968) for paraphrasing modal claims into claims in the language of\npossible worlds will show that \u201caccording to the fiction of\npossible worlds, at any world, there are many worlds\u201d will not\nbe able to be derived, and so the move to \u201cnecessarily, there\nare many worlds\u201d cannot be carried through. Thus if\nfictionalists stick closely to the possible-worlds\n\u201ctranslations\u201d given in Lewis 1968, they will be able to\navoid the threatened collapse.\n\nThe way the Brock/Rosen objection is raised by Rosen begins with an\napparently harmless statement of contingency: (numbering of claims are\nRosen\u2019s, and while Brock and Rosen\u2019s presentations are\nreasonably informal, the formal translations are given by Noonan, and\nhis numberings for those are provided)\n\n(2) Necessarily, it is contingent whether kangaroos exist\n\n\nor to put it in formal modal logic (Kx = x is a\nkangaroo):\n\n\u25a1 (\u25ca\u2203xKx & \u25ca\u00ac\u2203xKx)\n\n\nFrom this, Rosen claims, the \u201cstandard analysis\u201d\ndelivers:\n\n(3) At all worlds, there are worlds where kangaroos exist and worlds\nwhere they don\u2019t.\n\n\nIgnoring for our purposes the complications which need to be\nintroduced if we are to add accessibility relations between worlds,\nthe Lewis 1968 equivalent of (2) is\n\n(3L) \u2200w(Ww\u2192\n\u2203w\u2032(Ww\u2032 &\n\u2203x(Ixw\u2032 & Kx)) &\n\u2203w\u2033(Ww\u2033 &\n\u00ac\u2203x(Ixw\u2033 & Kx))))\n\n\nNoonan points out that this formula does not imply\n\n(4L) \u2200w(Ww\u2192\n\u2203w\u2032(Ww\u2032 &\nIw\u2032w &\n\u2203w\u2033(Ww\u2033 &\nIw\u2033w &\n\u00acw\u2032=w\u2033)))\n\n\nwhich is the formula required in Lewis 1968 to be able to move back to\n\u201cnecessarily, there are two worlds\u201d, and which is the\nformula Brock and Rosen would need to derive if they were to show that\nRosen\u2019s (2) (or Brock\u2019s equivalent) led the modal\nfictionalist to have to say that there are literally several worlds.\nThe reason why (3L) does not imply (4L) is that it is not enough for\nthere to be two worlds at a given world (V, let us call it)\nthat there be existential quantification over two worlds within the\nscope of an existential quantifier committing us to V: the\ntwo worlds must also be \u201cin\u201d V, in the sense that\nthe two place predicate \u201cI\u201d must hold between\nV and each of the worlds. This is what happens in (4L), but\nit does not happen in (3L), where there are two existential\nquantifiers over worlds in the scope of the outside universal\nquantifier, but where the worlds existentially quantified over are not\nasserted to be \u201cin\u201d any of the worlds w.\n\nRosen 1995 has accepted Noonan\u2019s resolution of the problem\napparently posed by the Brock/Rosen objection. Rosen has thus changed\nhis preferred proposal, so that instead of a general endorsement of\nthe position outlined by Lewis 1986, Rosen\u2019s recommendation for\nmodal fictionalists now relies more heavily on Lewis 1968. Instead of\nthe simpler biconditionals discussed near the beginning of this entry\nand in Rosen 1990, the revised proposal is to take equivalences\nasserted by Lewis 1968 between modal claims and claims couched in\nterms of quantification over possible worlds, and treat those\nequivalences instead as specifying connections between modal\nstatements and claims about what is true according to the fiction. If\na modal claim is literally true, its associated world-claim is true\naccording to the fiction, and vice versa.\n\nSo the state of play seems to be this: while the Brock/Rosen style\nobjection remains something for a modal fictionalist to be wary of\nwhen constructing the fiction of possible worlds, it is possible to\navoid the objection by being suitably careful about what fictionalist\nbiconditionals to employ: and if Noonan is right, strict adherence to\nthe fictionalist modification of the equivalences offered by Lewis\n1968 provides one suitable way of being careful. It is not\nuncontroversial, of course, that Noonan\u2019s strategy is the one a\nmodal fictionalist should employ: Divers 1999a and 1999b, Kim 2002 and\nDivers and Hagen 2006 argue that it is not.\n\nHow best to respond to the Brock-Rosen objection continues to be a\nmatter for debate: both Liggins 2008 and Woodward 2008 offer\nalternatives for the modal fictionalist.\n3.2 Hale\u2019s Dilemma\n\nBob Hale (in Hale 1995b) posed a dilemma for modal fictionalism (more\nspecifically, Rosen\u2019s version of modal fictionalism, though\nother varieties face a similar dilemma). A modal fictionalist who\nmaintains the version outlined in Rosen 1990 believes that the fiction\nof possible worlds (PW) is not literally true. A question arises about\nthe modal status of the fiction: is it necessarily false, or\ncontingently false? In either case, Hale argues, the modal\nfictionalist is in trouble.\n\nShould modal fictionalists claim that the story of possible worlds is\nnecessarily false, then Hale argues that they cannot gloss their\n\u201caccording to the fiction of possible worlds \u2026.\u201d\nprefix as \u201cwere the fiction of possible worlds true, then\n\u2026 would be true\u201d. This is because, according to Hale,\nconditional claims with antecedents which are necessarily false are\nautomatically true, so if the fiction of possible worlds is taken to\nbe necessarily false, then all conditionals of the form \u201cwere\nthe fiction of possible worlds true then \u2026\u201d are true, and\nnot merely the ones that the modal fictionalist wishes to endorse. If\nthe modal fiction is to be useful, not everything should be true\naccording to it: examples of claims that had better not be true\naccording to it include the claim that 2+2=7, or the claim that there\nare no possible worlds.\n\nOn the other hand, if the fiction of possible worlds (PW) is only\ncontingently false, Hale claims this also lands the Rosen\u2019s\nfictionalism in trouble, since if its falsehood is only contingent,\nthen the fiction might have been literally true (or it is possible\nthat the fiction be true). But according to Hale the \u201cofficial\nfictionalist paraphrase\u201d of what this possibility would amount\nto \u201ccannot adequately capture the content of the claim that\npossibly PW is true\u201d. (p 65) Hale claims this is so because the\nclaim \u201cAccording to PW, there is a possible world at which PW is\ntrue\u201d is equivalent for Rosen\u2019s fictionalist to \u201cIf\nPW were true, there would be a world at which PW is true\u201d: and\nthis conditional is one which would be true whether or not PW was\ntrue.\n\nA modal fictionalist might try to resist either horn of the dilemma.\nOn the first horn, modal fictionalists might employ another gloss on\nwhat it is to be true according to PW, or they might endorse one of\nthe various theories of conditionals on which conditionals with\nnecessarily false antecedents are not automatically true. On the\nsecond horn, even fictionalists who accepted that they were committed\nto analysing their claim that PW could have been true as \u201cIf PW\nwere true, there would be a world at which PW is true\u201d could\ndispute Hale\u2019s claim that this is inadequate (see for example\nDivers 1999b, pp. 325\u2013326).\n\nA third option, explored by Rosen 1995, is not to take PW to be false,\nbut rather altogether lacking a truth-value \u2014 e.g., in virtue of\nemploying terms with no literal application, such as \u201c\u2026\nis a world-mate of\u2026\u201d. Hale\u2019s dilemma is directed\nprimarily against fictionalists who take the literal content of their\nfiction to be false, and those fictionalists prepared to ascribe some\nother status to their fictional claims avoid the dilemma as initially\nstated (though this route may encounter difficulties of its own,\nespecially if it retains some sort of conditional analysis of the\n\u201caccording to PW\u201d prefix).\n\nRosen 1995 and Divers 1999b are among the responses to Hale, and Hale\nhas in turn responded to Rosen 1995 in Hale 1995a, where Hale argues\nthat several of the responses suggested by Rosen in turn face serious\nproblems. Skiba 2019 points out some complications that arise from\naddressing this challenge in a way that does not compromise a\nDivers-style \u201csafety result\u201d of the sort discussed above,\nthough Skiba argues that modal fictionalists can handle these\ncomplications.\n4. Other Concerns\n\nIn addition to the technical challenges facing modal fictionalism\noutlined in the previous section, modal fictionalism has been\nchallenged on a number of less technical grounds. Not all of these\nchallenges are equally cogent against every variety of modal\nfictionalism, and some explicitly have as their targets only some\nversions of the doctrine.\n4.1 Artificiality\n\nFictions are human products: they have authors, and those authors have\na good deal of control over what is true according to them (though\nexactly how much control is controversial). Alternatively, if it is\nthought that fictions are timeless Platonic abstract entities (sets of\npropositions, perhaps), we should say that which fictions we consider\nand express is a matter of human activity: and the\n\u2018authors\u2019 of those eternal Platonic fictions actually\nexpressed have a good deal of control over which of a variety of such\nfictions they express. However, \u201ctheoretical fictions\u201d\nintroduced as an alternative to realist theories, and which are\nsupposed to play a serious role in inquiry, do not seem to be able to\nbe as arbitrary. Not any old story told about possible worlds will\nserve as the modal fiction, at least if it is to provide the heuristic\nand other advantages of talk about possible worlds. The suspicion is\nthat in some respects talk of possible worlds cannot be like paradigm\nfiction, since the \u2018choice\u2019 of which story about possible\nworlds should count as the modal fiction is not as up to us as what to\nsay about Sherlock Holmes was up to Conan\n Doyle.[6]\n\n\nModal fictionalists can certainly respond to the more general worry\nthat fictionalism makes it too arbitrary which particular story about\npossible worlds ought to be employed. After all, the purposes of the\nfiction constrain what sorts of fiction are suitable, just as not any\nold story about a gas will serve to provide an \u201cideal gas\u201d\nwhich has a behaviour approximated by real gases. Some story must be\ntold about what sorts of constraints are appropriate, and why: and\nthis can be difficult in its own right (see the \u201cwhich fiction\nshould be employed\u201d section, below). Even if there are\nsubstantial constraints on what story will be adequate, and these\nconstraints are not due merely to facts about us or our choices, there\nmay still be some scope for the story to be artificial to a small\ndegree, for some points of detail may be left underdetermined by the\nconstraints. This may also be considered a problem, but it is unlikely\nto be fatal.\n\nThere is a more specific worry that remains even if a suitable account\nof what constraints there are on the modal fiction can be given. This\nis that it is too contingent a matter whether there is a modal fiction\nat all. After all, if there had never been any sentient creatures, no\nstories would ever have been told, and even if the modal fiction is\nconstrued as a Platonic entity (a collection of propositions,\nperhaps), it may never have been a fiction if it was never expressed\nby story-tellers. (Of course if nothing hangs on whether or not it is\na fiction, then this will not worry the Platonist modal fictionalist).\nThis worry, again, is particularly pressing if modal truth is to\ndepend on the contents of the fiction, since it does not seem that\nwhether or not blue swans are possible, for example, depends on\nwhether or not anyone ever told stories. There are responses to this\nworry, and responses to these responses: see Nolan 1997a, Kim 2005 or\nDombrovszki 2017.\n\nSauchelli 2013 is a recent contribution to this debate that points out\nanother aspect of the problem about artificiality, especially for a\nfictionalist who intends an analysis of modal claims in terms of a\nfiction of possible worlds. Many people at different times and in\ndifferent places have made modal claims: Sauchelli mentions the\nexample of Caesar considering whether he could cross the Rubicon. Most\npeople have little or no contact with fictions of possible worlds, or\ntheories of possible worlds intended to be factual but useable as\nfictions. Those people lack access to the fictions that are\nsupposed to underpin the truth of their modal claims. Sauchelli claims\nthis makes for both an implausible modal epistemology for figures like\nCaesar and an implausible account of how people like Caesar can even\nunderstand modal claims. \n\nWoodward 2011 uses \u201cthe artificiality objection\u201d to refer\nto both the problem discussed in this section and the problem\ndiscussed in section 4.3. That paper contains a response to\nthis artificiality objection on pp. 537\u2013548.\n4.2 Incompleteness\n\nFictions are often incomplete: they are silent about some issues. The\nSherlock Holmes stories make no representation one way or the other\nabout the exact population of India, or whether the number of hairs on\nDr Watson\u2019s head is odd or even. Arguably, the modal fiction\nwill be incomplete too: there will be some propositions such that\nneither they nor their negations will be true according to the\nfiction. This prospect raises several worries.\n\nFirst, there is the \u201cincompleteness problem\u201d discussed by\nRosen in Rosen 1990, pp. 341\u2013345. There are some modal issues\n(and corresponding issues about the nature of possible worlds) that a\nrealist may well be silent on: not because they believe there is no\nanswer, but rather because they believe themselves ignorant of the\nanswer. A fictionalist who treats the realist\u2019s theory as a\nfiction, on the other hand, will be silent upon the same issues\n\u2014 but this can lead to a more serious problem. If the fiction is\nsilent on an issue (Rosen\u2019s example concerns the size of\nworlds), it is not that the issue is unknown \u2014 it is that the\nfiction does not represent a fact of the matter one way or the other.\nSo it might appear for the fictionalist there is not an unknown modal\nfact \u2014 either the claim is false because the corresponding\nworlds-claim is not true according to the fiction, or something\ninvolving a truth-value gap is going on. Rosen also discusses what\neffect this might have on modal claims corresponding to such silences.\nA detailed discussion and critique of Rosen on this issue can be found\nin the following supplementary document:\n\n [Rosen\u2019s Incompleteness Worry]\n \n\nWhat is uncontentious is that modal fictionalists operating with\nfictions which are incomplete in the way, e.g., that the fiction of\nRosen 1990 is, will face difficulties, or at least departures from\northodoxy which will be found unattractive by some. Woodward 2012\noffers an approach that ensures modal claims are indeterminate in\ntruth value when the fiction of possible worlds is apparently silent\nabout corresponding questions about possible worlds, through offering\na treatment of the fiction on which it is indeterminate what the\nfiction itself represents in these cases. Skiba 2017 criticises both\nthe approach taken in the note above and the approach Woodward offers,\nand suggests one way out for the modal fictionalist is to endorse\napparently contradictory sentences that threaten to follow, but to\ntreat these apparent contradictions as only apparent, since\nunder analysis the modal sentences that appear to contradict each\nother really express compatible propositions about the modal\nfiction.\n\nAnother \u201cincompleteness\u201d worry in the literature is that\nexpressed in Nolan 1997a. This is also a worry that the modal fiction\nwill not represent as much as is desirable, though the concern is not\nconfined to those areas in which realists might confess ignorance.\n(The concern resembles an objection Lewis brings against \u201csparse\nlinguistic ersatzism\u201d in Lewis 1986, pp. 142\u2013165.) A modal\nfiction, to be adequate, must represent a very great deal about\npossible worlds, since there are infinitely many claims about possible\nworlds that must be part of the content of the fiction, if there are\nto be enough possible-worlds claims to correspond to all the modal\nclaims we would accept. Only a tiny proportion of the propositions\nabout possible worlds needed will be able to be stated explicitly by\nthe modal fictionalist: constraints of time and space and publication\ncosts will mean that the fictionalist will need to describe the\nfictional worlds in only a few volumes, while an exhaustive explicit\ndescription of even a single possible world as complex as our actual\nworld is beyond our finite resources.\n\nWhat modal fictions will presumably have, however, are generalisations\nabout possible worlds: for instance, principles of recombination and\nplenitude, principles about what truths are respected by all worlds,\nand so on. The modal fictionalist might reasonably hope that these\ngeneralisations imply all of the specific claims needed by\nthe fiction. Implication is, however, a modal notion: not that this is\nautomatically a problem, but it will be a problem for the\n\u201cstrong\u201d modal fictionalist, who seeks to reductively\nanalyse modality in terms of what is true according to the fiction.\nThe strong modal fictionalist\u2019s analysis will be circular if he\nhas to appeal to something like implication (or related modal notions)\nto spell out what claims are represented as true by the fiction, as it\nseems he must if the bulk of the claims are to be represented only\nimplicitly. It seems that a strong modal fictionalist will be stuck\nwith a radically incomplete fiction, if he relies only on what his\nmodal fiction explicitly says, or he faces the task of specifying the\nimplicit content of the modal fiction without recourse to modal\nnotions like implication.\n\nA strong modal fictionalist could attempt to capture non-explicit\ncontent in ways that did not rely on modal resources: one way this\ncould be attempted would be to offer a syntactic account (or some\nother non-modal account) of some sort of consequence relation, and to\nstipulate that the fiction is to be considered closed under the\nrelation thus specified. However, this is not easy to do in such a way\nthat all of the necessary semantic consequences are indeed\n\u201cconsequences\u201d of the explicit generalisations given.\nFurthermore, success at this project threatens to undermine the strong\nmodal fictionalist\u2019s project in another way: for if it was\npossible to give a specification of a relation of\n\u201cconsequence\u201d without relying on primitive modal notions,\nand that did the work of semantic consequence, then this would offer\nan analysis of \u201cbroadly logical\u201d consequence (and\npresumably related notions, such as logical necessity and possibility)\ndirectly, rather than in terms of what was true according to a modal\nfiction, thus making the strong modal fictionalist\u2019s analysis of\nmodality in terms of the fiction redundant. So the strong modal\nfictionalist faces a serious challenge in providing a fiction capable\nof representing what is needed for his theory to be adequate.\n4.3 Which Fiction Should Be Employed?\n\nAn essential part of an adequate modal fictionalist theory is a\nspecification of the fiction of possible worlds which is to be\nemployed. As well as selecting one of the many potential candidate\nstories about worlds, it is also essential to provide an explanation\nand justification of the choice. This is very rarely done by modal\nfictionalists (Armstrong 1989 provides an exception). This is not to\nsay that it cannot be done, or cannot be done plausibly: but\njustifying the choice of fiction is not something that can be\nneglected if a modal fictionalist theory is to be convincing.\nChristopher Peacocke (Peacocke 1999, p. 154) charges Rosen\u2019s\nmodal fictionalist with \u201cfetishism\u201d unless the\nfictionalist can say what is so distinctive about the particular\nfiction chosen.\n\nAs with so many other challenges, timid modal fictionalism can\nimmediately provide the outlines of an answer to this question.\n(Though it is to be remembered that timid modal fictionalism is able\nto avoid so many theoretical difficulties only because the fiction is\nnot asked to do much theoretical work). If the truths of possibility\nand necessity (and conditionality, and other modal truths) obtain\nwithout dependence on the content of the modal fiction, it is surely\nreasonable to suppose that whichever fiction it is correct to employ,\nit must respect those independently obtaining modal truths. Strong\nmodal fictionalists must also ensure that the contents of the fiction\nare associated with the modal claims they wish to make in the\nappropriate way, of course, but this will be of less help to them in\nestablishing the content of the modal fiction. For if the content of\nthe modal fiction is to explain the truth of the modal claims, it must\nbe able to be fixed independently, on pain of circularity. This is\nespecially so if the strong modal fictionalist holds, as one well\nmight, that it is our understanding of the modal fiction that provides\n(perhaps implicitly) our epistemic access to which modal claims are\ntrue and which false. Giving a non-circular specification of the\ncontent of the modal fiction is one of the very difficult challenges\nfacing the strong modal fictionalist.\n\nWhile strong modal fictionalists cannot appeal to an independently\nconstituted body of modal truths, one thing they can do is insist that\nthe modal fiction respect our ordinary modal judgments: that\nis, that by and large if we accept a modal claim as true, the\nassociated claim involving possible worlds will be true according to\nthe modal fiction. (Rosen 1990, p. 337, speaks of the desideratum that\nmodal fictionalism \u201cratify a substantial body of prior\nmodal opinion\u201d.) This is presumably not to forbid any departures\nfrom our pre-theoretic modal judgements, should they be required, but\nit would provide a way even for the strong fictionalist to rule out\ngratuitous departures from our modal opinions.\n\nThe next obvious source of content for the modal fiction is the\nliteral truth about our actual world (Rosen 1990, p. 335). The\naddition of all literally true non-modal propositions (in a suitable\nsense of \u201cnon-modal\u201d) to the fiction as part of its\ndescription of the actual world is useful, since it provides a rich\nsource of content that can be extended by, for instance, a principle\nof recombination, to yield claims about non-actual worlds. It would\nalso seem to be required, for if the fiction fails to be committed to\nthe actual world verifying a certain non-modal truth q, the\ninference from q to Actually-q and back will be\njeopardised. Some particular non-modal truths may prove especially\nuseful: Armstrong 1989, pp. 138\u2013139 mentions analytic truths,\ntruths in virtue of the meanings of terms, in this connection. One can\neither add the actual-world non-modal content by including an\n\u201cencyclopedia\u201d in the fiction, as Rosen does, or one could\nallow it in by, for example, stipulating as extra bridge-laws\nbiconditionals of the form:\n\nP iff According to PW, at the actual world, P\n\n\nfor all non-modal propositions P.\n\nAs well as conformity with our pre-theoretic modal judgements and\ninclusion of an encyclopedia of actual non-modal truths, Rosen 1990\nmentions another source of information to apply in specifying the\nmodal fiction. We have practices of forming modal beliefs involving\nimagining situations in accord with principles of recombination,\nnon-arbitrariness, and so on (p. 339-40). Rosen points out that while\na realist has the challenge of explaining why this practice of\nimagining should be a guide to modal truth, the fictionalist need not\nface this challenge if those practices are part of the process of\nconstructing the fiction of possible worlds. If the constraints, or\nlimits, on our imaginative practices when considering hypothetical\nsituations are vital in our practice of making many of our modal\njudgements, it would make sense to similarly constrain the modal\nfiction.\n\nThere are no doubt many other sorts of constraints which a modal\nfictionalist may appeal to in order to narrow down the class of\nfictions about possible worlds which are acceptable for her purposes.\nEven after all of these constraints are in place, however, there may\nstill be the theoretical possibility that more than one fiction about\npossible worlds (complete or incomplete) satisfies them equally well.\nA fictionalist facing a choice between equally deserving fictions\nwould need to address the issue of what attitude to take to other\nmodal fictionalists who choose differently. (Should they be judged\nincorrect? Correct, because judgements about the content of the modal\nfiction are relative to which (acceptable) fiction is adopted? Or\nshould they be judged to be talking about something else?). Or perhaps\nthe fictionalist could find some way to avoid making the choice of one\nsingle fiction. Woodward 2011 explores one way to avoid making this\nchoice: he suggests modifying the fictionalist biconditional to relate\nmodal claims to a range of acceptable fictions, allowing for\nsome truth-value gaps when the acceptable fictions diverge from each\nother.\n\nIf the fictions disagreed sufficiently, there may even be fictions\nwhich meet the constraints but which differ on matters which are\nlinked through the fictionalist\u2019s biconditionals with literal\nmodal claims. (This is only possible if the modal truths themselves\nare not being appealed to as constraints on acceptable fictions, so is\nnot a problem which faces the timid modal fictionalist). If the\nconstraints are not enough to uniquely determine the truth-value of\nevery modal claim, then not only the determinacy of the content of the\nfiction but the determinacy of the truth-value of some modal claims is\nat stake. Are those modal claims true or false, or neither? Might they\nbe fiction-relative, so there are no-fault disagreements about\nthem?\n\nThis is not the place to attempt to settle the matter of whether\nconstraints are likely to uniquely determine a modal fiction, nor\nwhether it would be genuinely objectionable if they did not do so.\nRather, the issues are mentioned as ones to be kept in mind when\nformulating or defending a modal fictionalist theory.\n4.4 The Theoretical Primitives of Modal Fictionalism\n\nMetaphysical theories often rely on resources which are taken as\n\u201cprimitive\u201d: roughly, theoretical resources which are not\nto be further explained or analysed. Different theories of the same\nsubject matter will often take different resources to be primitive,\nand while it is a difficult question to decide whether one set of\nprimitives is better or worse than another, evaluation of the relative\nsimplicity, naturalness, or other merits of theoretical primitives is\npart of the evaluation of rival theories. This sort of comparison can\ncan be especially relevant in areas where disputes between rival\ntheories are not to be settled easily by experiment or observation.\nSuch disputes make up one of the battlegrounds between fictionalists\nand their rivals, with anti-fictionalists claiming that the unanalysed\ntheoretical resources which fictionalists rely on render fictionalist\ntheories unattractive, or at least relatively unattractive compared to\nsome rival or other.\n\nThe central piece of theoretical machinery the modal fictionalist\nemploys is the \u201cAccording to PW \u2026\u201d operator. When\nit is glossed in tempting ways, as \u201cif PW were true, then\n\u2026\u201d or \u201cit follows from PW that \u2026\u201d, it\nseems to be a modal notion: and if this is not to be further\nexplained, the modal fictionalist cannot use the fiction of possible\nworlds and its contents as the basis of an analysis of modality in\nterms of something else. (This sort of analysis is sometimes known as\na reductive analysis.) This will only be of concern to some\nmodal fictionalists, of course \u2014 timid fictionalists will not\nhave been looking for a reductive analysis of modality based on their\nfiction in the first place \u2014 and some timid fictionalists such\nas Divers 1999b explicitly endorse modal explanations of the\nfictionalist operator (Divers 1999b, p. 335). Such fictionalists may\nbe happy to take advantage of possible analyses of \u201caccording to\nthe fiction\u201d operators in modal terms, and in so doing provide\nan answer to the question of how to understand such expressions: but\non the other hand, their position may not be attractive to someone\nprimarily concerned to analyse modal operators. (Even timid\nfictionalism is compatible with a reductionist account of modality, of\ncourse, since the timid fictionalist may seek to explain modality in\nsome other terms. It is just that it is not hospitable to reductionist\naccounts of modality in terms of possible worlds).\n\nA fictionalist who wishes to provide an analysis of modality, on the\nother hand, had better not take their \u201caccording to PW\n\u2026\u201d operator to be analysed in terms of standard modal\ndevices, or alternatively in terms of possible worlds (see Rosen 1990,\npp. 344\u2013345). The canonical version of the theory that Rosen\npresents takes the \u201cAccording to PW \u2026\u201d operator to\nbe a primitive one: that is, one which is not to be further analysed,\nin modal or non-modal terms (Rosen 1995, p. 70). Rosen points out that\none might think that his favoured prefix is a modal locution, and if\nso even his position cannot be said to entirely reduce the modal in\nfavour of the non-modal (Rosen 1990, pp. 344-345). Nevertheless, as he\npoints out, it may still be thought to be some theoretical advance to\nbe able to explain all of the other modal notions using only this one.\nIt is hard to know how the issue of whether or not \u201caccording to\nPW\u2026\u201d should count as a modal operator is to be decided:\nin any case, it will not be further pursued here.\n\nRegardless of its status as a modal locution, Rosen recognizes that it\nis a very unsatisfying primitive: the notion of a proposition being\ntrue according to PW is an unlikely one to be considered basic and\nunanalysable. Whether or not this is a fatal flaw of Rosen\u2019s\nproposal is, he acknowledges, \u201ca matter of somewhat delicate\njudgement\u201d (Rosen 1990, p. 349). What he does have to say about\nit, however, is that arguably many realists about possible worlds have\nalso not provided a satisfactory analysis of the \u201caccording to\nthe fiction \u2026\u201d operator, and so face the same\n challenge.[7]\n\n\nThe issue of whether \u201cAccording to PW\u2026\u201d is a\nsatisfactory theoretical primitive is presumably partly to be settled\nby seeing what rival theories are possible, and what primitives they\nneed to rely on to account for modality and for fiction. Beyond that,\nhow to settle disputes about the relative attractiveness of primitives\nis a difficult issue in philosophical methodology. Taking such an\napparently complex operator to be unanalysable looks unattractive\n(Nolan 1997a, pp. 273\u2013274), but the position is perhaps not\nuntenable. A better option for the modal fictionalist interested in\nanalysing modality in terms of the modal fiction might be to attempt a\nnon-modal explanation of what is true according to fiction. In any\ncase, this problem, like many problems for modal fictionalism, does\nnot arise for the timid modal fictionalist. For those fictionalists\nfor which it is a problem, however, the unattractiveness and\nunintuitiveness of taking \u201cAccording to PW\u2026\u201d or a\nsimilar device to be primitive remain a largely unaddressed\nchallenge.\n4.5 Does Modal Fictionalism Deliver Possible Worlds Semantics?\n\nJohn Divers in Divers 1995 argues that modal fictionalism cannot\ndeliver the benefits of the standard possible worlds semantics for\nmodal discourse. There is a discussion of Divers\u2019s argument in\nthe following supplementary document: \n\n [Modal Fictionalism and Possible Worlds Semantics]\n \n4.6 Three More Concerns\n\nModal fictionalism has attracted a range of other objections and\nconcerns. Some of these can be generalised to other fictionalist\nprojects; some generalise to other approaches to possible worlds; and\nsome seem to rely on specific features of modal fictionalist\nproposals. Rather than trying to describe each controversy in detail,\nI will briefly outline three with some references for those who wish\nto track down the relevant\n literature.[8]\n\nThe Threat from Abstractionism: Fictionalists seem to\nneed fictions, in the sense of stories or story-like entities. Some\nrealists about possible worlds treat possible worlds themselves as\nrepresentational entities of the same general sort that fictions seem\nto be: these theorists are \u201cabstractionists\u201d in the\nterminology of van Inwagen 1986, or \u201cersatzers\u201d in the\nterminology of Lewis 1986. Abstractionists may take worlds to be\nconstructions out of sentences, or perhaps more commonly identify\nworlds with maximal propositions or with constructions out of\npropositions (e.g. sets of propositions). Once we have representations\nthat are rich enough to represent every possibility, fictionalists\nneed to explain why they prefer to be be fictionalists rather than\nidentifying possible worlds with the appropriate representations.\n\nAbstractionist realism seems more straightforward than fictionalism in\na number of ways, so fictionalists, particularly platonist\nfictionalists, risk being victims of their own success and collapsing\ninto a kind of realism. (Nolan 1997a p 272 mentions this worry.) Rosen\n1990, particulary on pp 328\u20139, mentions some motivations for a\nfictionalist to not be an abstractionist. Turp 2011 discusses a\nsimilar challenge: on many accounts of the ontology of fiction,\nfictional worlds would themselves be some sort of existing abstract\nobject, of the sort that a fictionalist who wishes to reject\nabstractionism seems committed to rejecting. Finally, Dombrovszki 2017\nendorses the existence of the possible worlds postulated by a modal\nfiction: in his \u201chybrid modal fiction\u201d possible worlds are\ncreatures of fiction but nevertheless exist (much as so-called\n\u201cfictional realists\u201d hold that Sherlock Holmes is a\nfictional object that exists). If Dombrovszki is right, this is not so\nmuch a threat from abstractionism as an opportunity to be a modal\nfictionalist and a realist about possible worlds at the same time.\n\nConcern About Concern: Rosen 1990 (pp 349\u2013354)\ndiscusses an \u201cargument for concern\u201d against modal\nfictionalism, analogous to an argument from concern famously offered\nby Saul Kripke against David Lewis\u2019s counterpart theory. (Kripke\n1980 p 45) Hubert Humphrey, upon losing an election, cares that he\ncould have won. On the face of it, he does not care that someone like\nhim elsewhere in reality does win. Yet according to David\nLewis\u2019s analysis of what it is for Humphrey to have possibly\nwon, his possibly winning amounts to a \u201ccounterpart\u201d of\nHumphrey winning a (counterpart) election in another possible\nworld.\n\nLikewise, Humphrey presumably does not care very much whether a\nspecial story about him claims that he wins in an alternative\nuniverse. Rosen, along with many other philosophers, thinks that this\nwould not directly show there was any problem with a theory that\naccounted for the possibility of Humphrey winning in terms of the\ngoings-on in another concrete universe, or the contents of a\ndistinctive fiction: Humphrey might care about a fact without\nrealising what the analysis of that fact involves (Rosen 1990 p 349).\nRosen instead suggests there may be a \u201cpragmatic\u201d cost to\nthe view: those who come to accept it may have to revise substantially\nwhat they care about, either by caring more about the goings-on of a\nstory, or less about what could have happened. There is also the\nquestion of why we should care about what happens in any of the\nplausible candidate fictions: this perhaps touches on the question of\nchoosing a fiction discussed in 4.3, above.\n\nLewis 1986 pp 195\u2013197 argues that a version of the argument from\nconcern can be at least raised about any realist possible worlds\ntheory account of possibility: and, he would likely add, any\nfictionalist account as well. If Humphrey is unfamiliar with\npossible-worlds-jargon, he may not take himself to have any concern\nwith possible worlds when it hurts that he could have won. Of course,\ntheorists may wish to offer reasons why some accounts do better in\nrespecting the facts about what we are concerned with than others. (Or\nindeed give general reasons why no argument from concern is a\nchallenge to theories of possibility.)\n\nAbout Aboutness: Armour-Garb (2015, 1212\u20131218)\nraises a concern for a modal fictionalist seeking an \u201celliptical\nrendering\u201d of modal claims in terms of a claim about what is true\naccording to a fiction of possible worlds. It is that the modal claims\nwe begin with are not about the same things as the paraphrases in\nterms of a fiction of possible worlds. For example, instead of the claim that possibly, there are blue swans, which seems to be about swans and their color, we in effect get a claim about a fiction (we get a claim that means \u201caccording to MF, there are blue swans in a possible world\u201d). \n This is a problem, according to\nArmour-Garb, because the point of modal claims involves them being\nabout the things they normally seem to be about, so the modal\nfictionalist\u2019s substitute is inadequate. A theorist could, of\ncourse, endorse the fictionalist biconditional without thinking that\nmodal claims are about a fiction of worlds at all. Rosen 1990 does\ntalk, in the case of strong modal fictionalism, of an\n\u201canalysis\u201d of modal claims in terms of claims about what\nis true according to the modal fiction, so modal fictionalists who\nwant to follow him in this need to be clear about whether they think\nthis analysis gives the meaning of the modal claims they use. And if\nthe analysis is intended to give the meaning of modal expressions, they should make clear why\nit does not change the subject from what we took ourselves to be\nsaying all along.\n",
