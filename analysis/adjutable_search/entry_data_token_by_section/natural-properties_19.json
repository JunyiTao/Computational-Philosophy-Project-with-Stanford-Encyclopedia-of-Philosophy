    "main_text": "Naturalness and other notions || 1 Grounding\n5. Doubts about naturalness\n\nThe question whether to admit distinctions of naturalness among\nproperties is often treated as a major choice point for theorising in\nmetaphysics. Lewis presents his various proposals involving\nnaturalness as part of an overarching argument for the good standing\nof the notion of naturalness, based on its theoretical utility.\nMeanwhile, the rejection of distinctions of naturalness is often (e.g.\nby Taylor\n 1993)\n thought of as bound up with the denial of \u201cmetaphysical\u201d\nor \u201cfull-blooded\u201d realism, and associated with\ncontroversial claims about mind-dependence or\nperspective-relativity.\n\nBut it is not obvious what is at issue in such disagreements. If\n\u201crejecting\u201d naturalness means holding that\n\u2018natural\u2019 is literally unintelligible (on the\nrelevant use), it seems misguided. So long as we take understanding a\nword to be a matter of induction into a practice rather than some\ndubious \u201cmagical grasp\u201d (Sider\n 2011,\n \u00a72.1), it is hard to imagine some plausibly attainable standard\nfor intelligibility that the practice of using \u2018natural\u2019\nin the relevant way fails to meet. A more promising idea is simply to\nequate \u201crejection\u201d of naturalness with the claim that no\nproperty is more natural than any other. (Similarly, atheists will do\nbetter claiming that nothing is more holy than anything else than\nclaiming that the word \u2018holy\u2019 is unintelligible.)\nUnfortunately, if we try to structure a debate around the question\n\u2018Are some properties more natural than others?\u2019, we will\nrun a serious risk of equivocation. One participant may treat it as\ndefinitional that if there are any distinctions of naturalness,\nnaturalness plays a certain wide array of the roles that Lewis and\nothers have claimed for it in the theories of similarity, lawhood,\nreference, epistemic value, etc.; such a philosopher will treat any\nargument that no single ranking of properties plays all of these roles\nas an argument that no property is more natural than any other.\nAnother participant might give pride of place to (say) the connection\nbetween naturalness and similarity, treating as obvious that some\nproperties are more natural than others (since some things are more\nsimilar to one another than others), while treating it as an open\nquestion whether naturalness has any interesting connection to\nlawhood, reference, etc. Such philosophers need not disagree over\nanything important.\n\nDorr and Hawthorne\n (2013)\n argue that \u2018Are some properties more natural than\nothers?\u2019 is too sensitive to unimportant disagreements about how\nphilosophical terms of art get their meanings to be a useful\n question.[69]\n Inspired by Lewis\u2019s work on theoretical terms (Lewis\n 1970b),\n they suggest that the central debates in this vicinity should focus,\ninstead, on the question which collections of the roles that\nnaturalness has been held to play in the literature are such that\nthere is some ranking of properties that plays all the roles\nin the collection. \u201cNaturalness enthusiasts\u201d will hold\nthat there is a single ranking of properties playing all or most of\nthe roles; \u201cnaturalness sceptics\u201d, meanwhile, will hold\nthat different roles impose incompatible constraints, so that no\nranking satisfies more than a few of them. (For example, one might\nthink that there is no family of properties on which all others\nsupervene and which are also such that properties with short, simple\ndefinitions terms of this family tend to be easier to refer to than\nproperties with only long, complex definitions.) Dorr and Hawthorne\ngive a long list of collections of roles whose co-satisfiability is\nnon-obvious. They also discuss one separate axis of disagreement: some\nwill think that \u2018natural\u2019, or at least \u2018perfectly\nnatural\u2019, is precise, or can readily be made so, while\nothers will regard it as vague, perhaps to a high\n degree.[70]\n\n\nOn this picture, the impression of a single choice point between\n\u201cadmitting\u201d and \u201crejecting\u201d naturalness is\nmisleading: the true theoretical landscape is quite intricate.\nMoreover, even the most \u201csceptical\u201d positions do not seem\nto have much of an anti-realist flavour. There is no obvious\nway to argue from the claim that there are extensive failures of\nco-satisfiability between the various alleged roles for naturalness,\nor from the claim that \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018perfectly\nnatural\u2019 are highly vague, to some controversial claim of\nmind-dependence or relativity. Theories about naturalness provide ways\nof sharpening and fleshing out what Lewis\n (1984, 228)\n calls \u201cthe traditional realism that recognises objective\nsameness and difference, joints in the world, discriminatory\nclassifications not of our own making\u201d. But the ideas discussed\nin this article do not seem particularly helpful for making any\nnontrivial sense of the competing vision, on which questions of\nsimilarity and classification are in some systematic way\n\u201csubjective\u201d or \u201cup to us\u201d.\n",
