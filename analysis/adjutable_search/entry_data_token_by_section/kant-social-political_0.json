The Place of Political Philosophy within Kant\u2019s Philosophical System\n\nKant\u2019s political philosophy is a branch of practical philosophy,\none-half of one of the broadest divisions in Kant\u2019s thought\nbetween practical and theoretical philosophy. Political philosophy is\nalso to be distinguished within practical philosophy from both\nempirically-based elements and from virtue proper. The separation from\nvirtue is treated later in this section. Regarding the empirical\nelements, it is worth mentioning that practical philosophy, as a set\nof rules governing free behavior of rational beings, covers all human\naction in both its pure and applied (empirical, or\n\u201cimpure\u201d) aspects. Pure practical philosophy, the rational\nelements of practical philosophy in abstraction from anything\nempirical, is called by Kant \u201cmetaphysics of morals\u201d\n(4:388). Kant so emphasized the priority of the pure aspect of\npolitical philosophy that he wrote part of his essay \u201cOn the\nCommon Saying: That May be Correct in Theory, but it is of No Use in\nPractice\u201d in opposition to the view he associates with Hobbes\nthat the politician need not be concerned with abstract right but only\nwith pragmatic governance (8:289\u2013306). Yet Kant also included\nthe more pragmatic, impure, empirical study of human behavior as part\nof practical philosophy. For ethics in general, Kant called the\nempirical study of human beings as agents within particular cultures\nand with particular natural capacities \u201canthropology\u201d.\nSome of Kant\u2019s social philosophy fits into this rubric (see\nsection 10). While Kant always based his claims about right on a\npriori principle, he was applying the a priori principles to actually\nexisting beings, so he did at times include empirical claims in his\nanalysis. Some of these empirical claims are quite general and\nuncontroversial (e.g. that there are a plurality of human beings\nliving on the limited surface of a sphere) while others are more\nspecific to Kant\u2019s own time, place, and individual biases (e.g. his\nviews on women).\n\nPolitical philosophy is not only a branch of Kant\u2019s practical\nphilosophy, it strongly depends upon Kant\u2019s core practical\nphilosophy for its basis. Kant\u2019s practical philosophy and the\ncategorical imperative that governs it were intended to form the\nground not only for what is thought today to be ethics proper but also\nfor everything that broadly speaking had to do with deliberative human\nbehavior. He defined practical philosophy as that concerned with\n\u201crules of behavior in regard to free choice\u201d, as opposed\nto theoretical philosophy that concerned \u201cthe rule of\nknowledge\u201d (Kant 27: 243). Practical philosophy provided rules\nto govern human deliberative action. The Groundwork for the\nMetaphysics of Morals provided Kant\u2019s main arguments that\nthe categorical imperative is the supreme rule for human deliberative\naction. In its Preface, he notes that the Groundwork is to be\na preparatory book for a future Metaphysics of Morals. Twelve\nyears later he published that Metaphysics of Morals in two\nparts, the \u201cDoctrine of Right\u201d and the \u201cDoctrine of\nVirtue\u201d. Both are equally parts of Kant\u2019s practical\nphilosophy, and both thus have the categorical imperative as their\nhighest principle.\n\nThe book Metaphysics of Morals has two distinct parts: the\n\u201cDoctrine of Right\u201d and the \u201cDoctrine of\nVirtue\u201d. Kant sought to separate political rights and duties\nfrom what we might call morals in the narrow sense. He limits right by\nstating three conditions (6:230) that have to be met for something to\nbe enforceable as right: first, right concerns only actions that have\ninfluence on other persons, directly or indirectly, meaning duties to\nthe self are excluded; second, right does not concern the wish but\nonly the choice of others, meaning that not mere desires but only\ndecisions which bring about actions are at stake; and third, right\ndoes not concern the matter of the other\u2019s act but only the\nform, meaning no particular desires or ends are assumed on the part of\nthe agents. As an example of the latter he considers trade, which for\nright must have the form of being freely agreed by both parties but\ncan have any matter or purpose the agents want. These criteria appear\nto be less rigid than Kant ultimately intends, for the term\n\u201cinfluence\u201d is vague enough that it might include\nfar-reaching minor effects. They would also include under right\nactions even those imperfect duties that \u201cinfluence\u201d\nothers by improving their lot, such as beneficent acts of charity.\nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s \u201charm principle\u201d does not face\nthis problem since it specifies that the influence to be subject to\nlaw is always negative. While Kant must include consideration of\nbeneficent action as part of right, he does not conclude that\nbeneficent actions are required by right but only that most are\npermitted by right and others violate right. His focus on free\nindividual choice entails that any beneficent action that interferes\nwith or usurps the recipient\u2019s free choice is wrong (for\nexample, improving the recipient\u2019s property without permission\nas opposed to merely donating money to a fund made available to the\nrecipient at the recipient\u2019s discretion). Kant summarizes these\nconditions with a definition of the concept of right as \u201cthe sum of\nthe conditions under which the choice of one can be united with the\nchoice of another in accordance with a universal law of freedom\u201d\n(6:230).\n\nIn addition to these three conditions for right, Kant also offers\ndirect contrasts between right and virtue. He thinks both relate to\nfreedom but in different ways: right concerns outer freedom and virtue\nconcerns inner freedom (being master of one\u2019s own passions)\n(6:406\u201307). Right concerns acts themselves independent of the\nmotive an agent may have for performing them, virtue concerns the\nproper motive for dutiful actions (6:218\u2013221). In another\nformulation (6:380\u201381) he says that right concerns universality\nas a formal condition of freedom while virtue concerns a necessary end\nbeyond the mere formality of universality, thus appearing to tie the\ndistinction to the first two formulas of the categorical imperative in\nthe Groundwork. In yet another he says that right concerns\nnarrow duties and virtue wide duties (6:390). In the Feyerabend\nlectures, Kant notes that right is the subset of morally correct\nactions that are also coercible (27:1327). These various alternative\nformulations of the distinction would exclude imperfect duties not\nbecause imperfect duties do not \u201cinfluence\u201d others (they\ndo) but because, as imperfect, they cannot be coerced in particular\ninstances, since imperfect duties always allow for the moderating role\nof an individual\u2019s inclinations. While these various\nformulations of the distinction appear to be quite different, they can\nin general be summarized by saying that right concerns outer action\ncorresponding to perfect duty that affects others regardless of the\nindividual\u2019s internal motivations or goals.\n",
