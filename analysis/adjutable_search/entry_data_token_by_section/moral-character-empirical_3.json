The CAPS Model\n\nOne thread left over from the previous section had to do with the\nso-called \u201ccognitive-affective personality system\u201d or\n\u201cCAPS\u201d model. It will take a bit of work to introduce the\nmodel. But it is worth doing, since CAPS is currently receiving a lot\nof attention in the situationist literature in philosophy (Miller\n2003; Adams 2006: 131\u2013138; Russell 2009: chapters 8\u201310;\nSnow 2010: chapter 1). Plus, regardless of its relevance to that\nliterature, the CAPS model might have some important resources of its\nown to offer as an empirical approach to thinking about character.\nThis section first provides the needed background before turning to\nsome of the philosophical implications.\n",
