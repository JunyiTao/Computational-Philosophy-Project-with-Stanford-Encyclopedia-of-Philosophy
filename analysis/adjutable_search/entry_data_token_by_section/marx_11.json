    "main_text": "Theory of History || 1859 Preface\n3.3 1859 Preface\n\nIn the sketch of The German Ideology, many of the key\nelements of historical materialism are present, even if the\nterminology is not yet that of Marx\u2019s more mature writings.\nMarx\u2019s statement in the \u201c1859 Preface\u201d renders\nsomething of the same view in sharper form. Cohen\u2019s\nreconstruction of Marx\u2019s view in the Preface begins from what\nCohen calls the Development Thesis, which is pre-supposed, rather than\nexplicitly stated in the Preface (Cohen 1978 [2001]: 134\u2013174).\nThis is the thesis that the productive forces tend to develop, in the\nsense of becoming more powerful, over time. The productive forces are\nthe means of production, together with productively applicable\nknowledge: technology, in other words. The development thesis states\nnot that the productive forces always do develop, but that there is a\ntendency for them to do so. The next thesis is the primacy thesis,\nwhich has two aspects. The first states that the nature of a\nsociety\u2019s economic structure is explained by the level of\ndevelopment of its productive forces, and the second that the nature\nof the superstructure\u2014the political and legal institutions of\nsociety\u2014is explained by the nature of the economic structure.\nThe nature of a society\u2019s ideology, which is to say certain\nreligious, artistic, moral and philosophical beliefs contained within\nsociety, is also explained in terms of its economic structure,\nalthough this receives less emphasis in Cohen\u2019s interpretation.\nIndeed, many activities may well combine aspects of both the\nsuperstructure and ideology: a religion is constituted by both\ninstitutions and a set of beliefs.\n\nRevolution and epoch change is understood as the consequence of an\neconomic structure no longer being able to continue to develop the\nforces of production. At this point the development of the productive\nforces is said to be fettered, and, according to the theory, once an\neconomic structure fetters development it will be\nrevolutionised\u2014\u201cburst asunder\u201d (MECW 6:\n489)\u2014and eventually replaced with an economic structure better\nsuited to preside over the continued development of the forces of\nproduction.\n\nIn outline, then, the theory has a pleasing simplicity and power. It\nseems plausible that human productive power develops over time, and\nplausible too that economic structures exist for as long as they\ndevelop the productive forces, but will be replaced when they are no\nlonger capable of doing this. Yet severe problems emerge when we\nattempt to put more flesh on these bones.\n",
