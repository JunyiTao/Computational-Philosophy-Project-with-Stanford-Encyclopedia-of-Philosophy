    "main_text": "Being and Having\n5. Being and Having\n\nMarcel discusses being in a variety of contexts; however, one of the\nmore illustrative points of entry into this issue is the distinction\nbetween being and\n having.[6]\n In some cases this distinction is one that is obvious and therefore\nnot particularly illuminating. For example, most people would readily\nacknowledge a difference between having a house and being hospitable.\nHowever, there are other cases where the distinction between having\nsomething and being something is much more significant. For example,\nwhen we hope, we do not have hope. We are hope.\nSimilarly, we do not have a belief. We are a belief.\n\nMarcel\u2019s hallmark illustration of being and having is one that\nactually straddles the distinction between them: \u201cmy\nbody.\u201d My body, insofar as it is my body, is both\nsomething that I have and something that I am, and cannot be\nadequately accounted for using either of these descriptions alone. I\ncan look at my body in a disassociated manner and see it\ninstrumentally. However, in doing so, in distancing myself from it in\norder to grasp it qua object, qua something I have,\nit ceases to be \u201cmy\u201d body. I can have \u201ca\u201d\nbody, but not \u201cmy\u201d body. As soon as I make the connection\nthat the body in question is my body, not a body, it can no longer be\nsomething that I have pure and simple\u2014this body also is me, it\nis what I am. On the other hand, it cannot be said that I simply am my\nbody either. I can dispose of my body in certain circumstances by\ntreating it instrumentally. A person who loses a limb in an accident\nis not less of a person and, therefore, there is a sense in which our\nbodies are objects that we have.\n\nThe ambiguous role played by my body not only points out the\ndistinction between being and having, but also shows that we relate to\nother things and persons differently in these two modes. Having\ncorresponds to things that are completely external to me. I have\nthings that I possess, that I can dispose of\u2014and this should\nmake it clear that I cannot \u201chave,\u201d for example, another\nperson. Having implies this possession because \u201chaving always\nimplies an obscure notion of assimilation\u201d (Marcel 1949, p. 83).\nWhile the encounter with otherness takes place in terms of\nassimilation when speaking of having, the encounter with otherness\n(e.g., other persons) can also take place on the level of being. In\nthis case Marcel maintains that the encounter is not one that is\npurely external and, as such, it is played out in terms of presence\nand participation rather than assimilation.\n\nBoth being and having are legitimate ways to encounter things in the\nworld; however, the misapplication of these two modes of comportment\ncan have disastrous consequences.\n",
