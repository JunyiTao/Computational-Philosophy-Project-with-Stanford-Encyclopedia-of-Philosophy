    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe 6th century witnesses at once the culmination and the demise of a\nlong tradition of philosophical commentaries on the works of Plato and\nespecially Aristotle. This tradition already began in the 1st century\nBCE, but it becomes first tangible for us with the commentaries on\nAristotle of Aspasius in the 2nd century CE and especially with\nAlexander of Aphrodisias in the early 3rd century. This exegetical\ntradition reached its pinnacle in the first half of the 6th century\nwith the great works of Ammonius Hermeiou and his pupils Simplicius\nand John Philoponus. The latter was a Christian who, after much\ncriticism and polemic, broke with (pagan) Neoplatonic school\nphilosophy and turned his energy to the exegesis of biblical texts as\nwell as the theological controversies of his day. However, because of\nthe survival of even later commentaries attributed to philosophers\nwith Christian names such as Elias and David, it is commonly supposed\nthat in the later 6th century pagan philosophy was indeed still being\ntaught in Alexandria, only by Christians. This would then be in marked\ncontrast to Athens, where pagan philosophy died out rapidly after the\nAthenian academy was closed by Emperor Justinian in 529.\n",
