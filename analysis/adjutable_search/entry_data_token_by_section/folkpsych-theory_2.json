    "main_text": "Varieties of Theory Theory || Scientific Theory Theory\n2.2 Scientific Theory Theory\n\nScientific TT, henceforth STT, holds that folk psychology is the\nresult of evidence-driven scientific theorizing on the part of young\nchildren (Gopnik & Wellman 1992; Gopnik 1996; Gopnik &\nMeltzoff 1997). It proposes that each normally developing child forges\nand revises their own theory of mind using the same rational\ntheory-construction methods that adults use when forging and revising\nmature scientific theories.\n\nAdvocates of STT acknowledge that children\u2019s theories have the\ncharacteristic static features of mature scientific\ntheories\u2014e.g., internal coherence, causal implication, and\nontological import. Yet, their proposal focuses on the possibility\nthat children, like adult scientists, engage in the dynamic activity\nof theorizing to produce their ToM through processes of collecting,\nevaluating, and responding to evidence in a rational, truth-seeking\nmanner (Gopnik & Meltzoff 1997). Ex hypothesi, ToMs are the\nhard-won products of sustained observation, statistical analyses,\nexperimental trial-and-error, and learning from others (Gopnik 2003,\n2004; Gopnik & Meltzoff 1997). For these reasons, this brand of TT\nhas sometimes been dubbed the \u201cchild as little scientist\nview\u201d, although Gopnik came to prefer the slogan\n\u201cscientist as big child view\u201d (Gopnik 1996).\n\nEmphasizing the dynamic character of theorizing, STT maintains that we\nstart life with a basic theory of mind which we actively develop\nthroughout our childhood and adolescence. In particular, the concept\nof belief is thought to be constructed by each child, individually,\nduring ontogeny (Gopink 1988, 1990). In most cases, children who\nfollow a typical developmental pattern succeed in adding the concept\nof a false belief to their ToMs by around the age of four and they\ncontinue to enhance their understanding of belief even beyond this\nstage\u2014making further, less radical, changes to their ToM as they\nbecome young adults (Gopnik 2004). Empirical findings arising from\nfalse belief studies and methodological questions about such protocols\nare extensively discussed in\n Section 3.2.\n\nSupporters of STT take the appearance of conceptual development in\nontogeny at face value; they claim that genuine conceptual change\noccurs as children fashion their ToMs. In particular, they\nhold that the conceptual change this theory development\nputatively involves is driven by their activities of theory\nconstruction. On this version of TT, our FP understanding of minds is\ntheoretical in the strongest possible sense\u2014both in its nature\nand its mode of acquisition.\n",
