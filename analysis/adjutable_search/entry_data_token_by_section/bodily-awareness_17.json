    "main_text": "The sense of body ownership || The affective conception\n4.5 The affective conception\n\nThese last 20 years have seen an explosion of experimental work on\ninteroception. Recent accounts of interoception have highlighted its\nrole for self- awareness, positing it at the core of what is sometimes\ncalled the \u201csentient self\u201d (Craig 2003), the \u201cproto-\nself\u201d (Damasio 1999), the \u201cembodied self\u201d (Seth\n2013), or the \u201cmaterial me\u201d (Tsakiris 2017). Even\nDescartes in his Meditations on First Philosophy take\ninteroceptive feelings to be the key for our unique relationship with\nour body: \n\n\nNature likewise teaches me by these sensations of pain, hunger,\nthirst, etc., that I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a\nvessel. (Descartes 1641 [2016] Meditation VI, p. 56) \n\n\nHowever, even if interoception can ground some notion of the self, it\nis not clear that it is specifically involved in the sense of bodily\nownership. Imagine a creature that only receives interoceptive\nsignals. It receives information about its body, and its body only.\nBut there is a difference between self-specificity (information\nexclusively about the body that happens to be one\u2019s own) and\nself-reference (awareness of the body qua one\u2019s own).\nThe problem is that on the basis of interoception only, there is no\nneed to discriminate the inside from the outside since the body is\nonly an inside. It is so fixated on its own body that it can dispense\nwith representing whose body is hungry or thirsty. The fact is that\none usually says \u201cI am thirsty\u201d, without any reference to\nbodily ownership, let alone to the body.\n\nThere is, however, another way to spell out the affective conception\nwithout appealing to interoception. Instead it appeals to the notion\nof affective significance (Vignemont 2018). On what is called the Bodyguard hypothesis, there is a\nspecific affective phenomenology that goes over and above the sensory\nphenomenology of bodily experiences. It expresses the unique value of\nthe body for the self, a value that is evolutionarily rooted. In\nbrief, survival involves preservation of one\u2019s body. The sense\nof ownership then individuates the one body that matters to the\nsubject for self-preservation more than anything else. In line with\nthis view, it has been found that participants who report ownership\nfor the rubber hand display an increase of arousal when the rubber\nhand is under threat (Ehrsson et al. 2007). Vice-versa, patients with\nsomatoparaphrenia show no increase in arousal when they see the hand\nthat they felt as alien under threat (Romano et al. 2014).\n\nOne may object that evolutionary significance is only a consequence of\nthe fact of bodily ownership: this body matters because it is mine.\nConsequently, affective phenomenology should be just the consequence\nof the sense of bodily ownership: I feel that this body matters\nbecause I am aware that it is mine. However, one may reply that what\nhappens to the body that has this significance happens to me. Why is\nit so? One possibility is that it is because I am my body or more\nsimply because we evolved in a world such that for the self to\nsurvive, its body must survive. Hence, for my body to have such\nsignificance is for it to be the body to protect for the\norganism\u2019s evolutionary needs. Biology here provides an\nindependent ground to the notion of significance. The impact on what\nhappens on this body for oneself gives immediate ground for labeling\nit as one\u2019s own. Hence, one is entitled to judge that this is\none\u2019s own body when one feels that this body matters in this\nspecial way, because under normal circumstances the body that matters\nin such a way is one\u2019s own body.\n",
