    "main_text": "Objections || Relativism\n3.2 Relativism\n\nSeveral critics object that there is no unique reflective\nequilibrium. There are two objections here, one interpersonal, one\nintrapersonal. The interpersonal objection is considered first.\n\nSome advocates of reflective equilibrium combine the view with moral\nrealism, maintaining that the method can provide evidence of objective\nmoral truth (Brink 1989 and more tentatively Daniels 1996:\n37\u201339). Rawls takes a less metaethically ambitious approach, his\nconstructivist theory providing \u201cobjectivity for its limited\npolitical purposes\u201d (Rawls 2005: 110; see also Nielsen 1993;\nBrandstedt & Br\u00e4nnmark 2020). On either view reflective\nequilibrium can offer objective support for moral principles.\n\nCritics disagree, claiming that reflective equilibrium falls victim to\nrelativism. The objection starts with the observation that\ndifferent people following the method may reach different, conflicting\nequilibria (Dworkin 1973 [1975: 34\u201336]; de Maagt 2017:\n450\u2013451). How can it be the case that each of two or more\nconflicting views are objectively justified? The justification rather\nlooks to be relative to the deliberator.\n\nBut reflective equilibrium is properly understood as a\npotential source of justification. There is no need to claim\nthat it always offers evidence of moral truth or practical guidance.\nHence, the mere existence of conflicting equilibria does not mark the\ndescent into relativism. As Scanlon notes,\n\n\naccepting that some person is well informed and has carried out the\nsearch for reflective equilibrium conscientiously does not even commit\none to the conclusion that this person is justified in accepting the\nprinciples that result, let alone the conclusion that those principles\nare justified. (Scanlon 2003: 152)\n\n\nHe asks us to enquire as to the reasons for divergences between our\nequilibrium and that of another. Did we start with different\nconsidered judgments? Did the divergence arise due to later\nadjustments in considered judgments? Is it due to consideration of\ndifferent moral principles? At each stage we are to ask whether we\nfeel we made the better decisions or whether we might now revise our\njudgments and principles (Scanlon 2003: 152\u2013153; Scanlon 2014:\n79\u201381).\n\nWhat if we are content with the decisions leading to both\nequilibria? Two conflicting views being equally justified is not\nreally suggestive of relativism, but rather supports a pluralistic\nposition (Scanlon 2014: 79). It seems no less objective to judge that\ntwo equilibria are equally justified than it is to judge that one is\nmore justified than the other.\n",
