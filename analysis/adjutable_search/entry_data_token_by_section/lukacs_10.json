While the critique\nof Fichteanism in his writings between 1923 and 1928\u2014for example\nin his review of an edition of Lasalle\u2019s letters (1925b) and in a\npiece on Moses Hess (1926)\u2014constituted a significant step\ntowards such a model, it was impossible for him to write anything\ncontroversial on contemporary Marxism after the hostile reception of\nhis 1928 \u201cBlum Theses.\u201d Instead, he tackled the\nphilosophical foundations of these problems in the context of a new\nreading of the philosophical tradition, especially of Hegel.\n\nIn the reification essay, Luk\u00e1cs describes Hegel\u2019s philosophy\nas the only \u201cbourgeois\u201d theory of history and freedom that\ncomes close to solving the problem of reification due to its insight\nthat the abyss between subject and object can only be overcome by\nseeing both as elements within a process that actively produces the\nvery distinction between them. Thus, Luk\u00e1cs remains committed\nto the claim that Marxist social theory must be read as a critical\ncompletion\u2014rather than a rejection\u2014of Hegel. This means,\nhowever, that he must show that the Hegelian idealist metaphysics that\nMarx rejects does not exhaust Hegel\u2019s philosophy. His writings on\nHegel, most prominently The Young Hegel (1948) and the\nrelevant sections of the Ontology of Social Being, can be\nread as a defense of this commitment. In the former work,\nLuk\u00e1cs argues that Hegel\u2019s development of dialectics was\ninformed by his reading of the British economists Steuart and Smith.\nAccording to Luk\u00e1cs, this empirical grounding enabled Hegel\u2019s\ndialectics to draw on the idea of objective, social-historical\nprogress and to understand modern society and economy as a processual\ntotality that is structured by contradictions. Hegel\u2019s view of an\nontological dialectics must therefore be read as reflecting the\nstructure of objective social reality. The resulting\n\u201cobjectivism\u201d allowed Hegel to avoid the subjectivist\nconception of dialectics to which (as Luk\u00e1cs alleges) Kant and\nFichte still subscribed. Hegel, however, subordinated this objectivist\nontology to logic in the course of the development of his system. It\nis this \u201clogicism,\u201d i.e., the primacy of categories over\nbeing, that led Hegel to postulate the idealist conception of the\n\u201csubject-object\u201d that is needed to explain the identity of\nlogical categories and ontological determinations. This split between\na \u201cgenuine\u201d dialectics that reflects the objective\ncontradictions of society (even if in an idealist manner) and a\n\u201clogicist\u201d system is the main argument in\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s discussion of Hegel in the Ontology (see\nGW 13: 489f., 506, 520\u2013523).\n\nA second, much more problematic set of commitments was made explicit\nin Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s writings between the 1930s and the 1950s. This\nconcerns his conviction that, after Hegel, modern thought had become\nsharply divided into two opposing tendencies: \u201cMarxist\ndialectics\u201d and \u201cbourgeois irrationalism.\u201d\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s view that virtually all non-Marxist theorists after\nHegel\u2014including Schelling, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and\nHeidegger\u2014can be subsumed under the label of irrationalism (a\nblanket term which, depending on the context, refers to everything\nfrom theories of \u201cintellectual intuition,\u201d ontological\nsubjectivism, and \u201caristocratic\u201d epistemological positions\nto the denial of progress in history) was perhaps motivated by an\nearnest desire to apply the method of immanent critique (see Aronowitz\n2005) to developments within philosophy that had facilitated the rise\nof National Socialism. Some of his arguments against Heidegger also\nresemble Adorno\u2019s critique (see also Adorno 1997). Overall, however,\nhis philosophical arguments for the simplistic distinction between\nprogressive materialism and irrationalism\u2014in particular those\nthat he presents in The Destruction of Reason (according to\nGeorge Lichtheim, \u201cthe worst book he ever wrote\u201d;\nLichtheim 1970: 68)\u2014are dogmatic and superficial. A number of\nparticularly problematic claims are made in the postscript to the\nDestruction, where Luk\u00e1cs not only defends the Soviet\nUnion under Stalin but also accuses Bertrand Russell of being secretly\nreligious (1954: 808) and Wittgenstein and the pragmatists of being\nproponents of a form of subjectivism that had facilitated the rise of\na new form of fascism (1954: 782ff.; for other examples, see the\nunpublished 1933a).\n",
