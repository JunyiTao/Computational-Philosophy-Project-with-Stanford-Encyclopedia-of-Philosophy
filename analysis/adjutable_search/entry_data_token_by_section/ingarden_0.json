    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\n\nRoman Witold Ingarden was born on February 5, 1893 in Krak\u00f3w.\nHe initially studied mathematics and philosophy in Lw\u00f3w (now\nknown as \u2018Lviv\u2019 and in Ukraine), and in 1912 went to\nG\u00f6ttingen where he studied philosophy under Edmund Husserl,\ntaking four semesters of seminars with Husserl, from 1912 to 1914, and\nagain during the summer of 1915. Husserl considered Ingarden one of\nhis best students, and the two remained in close touch until Husserl\u2019s\ndeath in 1938 (their philosophical correspondence was eventually\npublished as Husserl\u2019s Briefe an Roman Ingarden).  Ingarden\nalso studied philosophy in Lw\u00f3w with Kazimierz Twardowski (who,\nlike Husserl, was a student of Franz Brentano). When Husserl accepted\nthe chair at Freiburg, Ingarden followed him, submitting his\ndissertation \u201cIntuition und Intellekt bei Henri\nBergson\u201d in 1917, for which he received his Ph.D. in 1918,\nwith Husserl as director.\n\n\nAfter submitting his dissertation, Ingarden returned to Poland for\nthe remainder of his academic career, first teaching mathematics,\npsychology and philosophy in secondary schools while he worked on his\nHabilitationschrift. That work, published as Essentiale Fragen\nin 1925, attracted some attention in the English speaking philosophical\nworld, being reviewed twice in Mind (by A.C. Ewing in 1926 and\nby Gilbert Ryle in 1927). With the publication of his\nHabilitationschrift, Ingarden was appointed as Privatdozent at the Jan\nKazimierz University in Lw\u00f3w, where he was promoted to Professor\nin 1933. During this time his most well known work, The Literary\nWork of Art, was first published (1931, in German), followed by\nThe Cognition of the Literary Work (1936, in Polish). His\nacademic career was interrupted from 1941\u20131944, when (due to the war)\nthe university was closed, and he secretly taught philosophy at the\nuniversity, and mathematics to secondary school children in an\norphanage. At the same time (and despite the bombing of his house in\nLw\u00f3w), Ingarden was working intensively on his magnum opus\nThe Controversy over the Existence of the World (the first two\nvolumes of which were published in Polish in 1947 and 1948\nrespectively). In 1945 he moved to Jagiellonian University in\nKrak\u00f3w, where he was given a chair in 1946, however in 1949,\n(under Stalinization) he was banned from teaching because of his\nalleged \u201cidealism\u201d (ironically, a philosophical position against which\nIngarden fought for most of his life) and for being an \u201cenemy of\nmaterialism\u201d. The ban continued until 1957, at which point\nIngarden was reappointed to his post at Jagiellonian University, where\nhe taught until his retirement in 1963 and continued to write,\npublishing such works as The Ontology of the Work of Art\n(1962) and Experience, Artwork and Value (1969). Ingarden died\nsuddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage on June 14, 1970, while still fully\nengaged in his philosophical projects. A careful, detailed, and fully\ndocumented account of Ingarden\u2019s biography may be found in\n[Mitscherling, 1997], which also does much to settle the\ninconsistencies in earlier partial accounts of Ingarden\u2019s life.\n\n\nLike many of Husserl\u2019s students from the G\u00f6ttingen period,\nIngarden is a realist phenomenologist who ardently resisted Husserl\u2019s\napparent turn to transcendental idealism in the Ideas and\nthereafter. Although his training is phenomenological, his work on the\nwhole is directed not towards understanding the basic structures of\nconsciousness, but rather towards ontology. Indeed, Ingarden is one of\nthe foremost practitioners of phenomenological ontology, which attempts\nto determine what the ontological structure and status of objects of\nvarious types must be, based on examining essential features of any\nexperience that could present or provide knowledge of such\nobjects\u2014a method based in the assumption that there are essential\ncorrelations between kinds of objects and the modes of cognition by\nmeans of which they can be known.\n\n\nIngarden\u2019s best-known works, indeed the only ones known to most of\nhis readers in the English-speaking world, are his works on aesthetics,\nespecially literature\u2014works that offer unrivalledly sophisticated\nand subtle accounts both of the ontological status of works of art of\nvarious kinds, and of our means of cognizing them. His phenomenological\napproach to aesthetics strongly influenced the work of Michel\nDufrennes, and there are also strong resonances between his work on the\nontology of art and contemporary analytic work in aesthetics, e.g., by\nJoseph Margolis, Nelson Goodman and Jerrold Levinson. The Literary\nWork of Art has been particularly influential in literary studies,\nwhere its effects are visible in Wolfgang Kayser\u2019s work Das\nsprachliche Kunstwerk and in the development of the schools of New\nCriticism and Reader Response Theory in the work of such theorists as\nRen\u00e9 Wellek and Wolfgang Iser, respectively.\n\n\nNonetheless, the frequently exclusive focus on Ingarden\u2019s work in\naesthetics is somewhat unfortunate and can be misleading about his\noverall philosophical focus and goals. For Ingarden produced an\nenormous body of work on a wide variety of topics. He raised early and important criticisms of what he called \u201cmethodological Positivism\u201d in a paper delivered in 1934 to the 8th World Congress of Philosophy in Prague, where Rudolf Carnap and Otto Neurath were present as respondents. There Ingarden argues that, by the positivist\u2019s own lights, \u2018metalogical\u2019 sentences about sentences should be counted as meaningless, since sentences themselves are not mere physical objects (to be sentences they must have a certain sense), and yet the methodological Positivist accepts only sentences about the physical as intersubjectively verifiable. If on the other hand, we do consider sentences to be mere physical \u2018mounds of ink\u2019 or \u2018sound waves\u2019, then they would not be verifiable (this, he seems to be suggesting, would be something like a category mistake: how can one verify a heap of ink?). Moreover, he argues (in what Pelletier and Linsky (2018) identify as a version of the \u2018Hysteron Proteron Objection\u2019) that in order to decide whether a sentence is verifiable, one must first identify its meaning \u201cindependently of its verification\u201d. The paper is now translated into English as \u201cA Logical Attempt at a New Formulation of Philosophy: A Critical Remark\u201d, and reprinted alongside the brief responses by Rudolf Carnap and Otto Neurath, and interesting contemporary discussion and evaluation by Pelletier and Linsky (2018), who suggest that Carnap never adequately responded to these criticisms. \n\n\nIngarden also produced a large body of work in epistemology, ontology, metaphysics,\nphenomenology, and value theory. The relative obscurity of Ingarden\u2019s\nwork in these other areas is attributable in part to the relative\nisolation and interruption of academic philosophy in Poland in the\nperiod of World War Two and Soviet occupation, and in part to language\nbarriers. Before the second world war, Ingarden (being German trained)\npublished his works mainly in German, thus his early works such as\nThe Literary Work of Art appeared in German early in his\ncareer, and were to have a broad impact. But during the war, Ingarden\n(in a gesture of solidarity) switched to writing in Polish, a language\nspeakers of English and other Western European languages were unlikely\nto read, and so his major works on ontology went largely unnoticed by\nthe wider European and Anglo-American philosophical circles. His major\nwork in ontology, The Controversy, for example, was not\ntranslated into German until 1964, and only in 2013 did Part 1 become\nfully available in English translation (an earlier partial translation\nwas published in 1964 as Time and Modes of Being).\n\n\nSeen more as a whole, Ingarden\u2019s body of work revolves not around\naesthetics, but rather around the realism/idealism problem \u2014 an issue\nthat was to dominate his thinking ever since, as a young man, he\nrecoiled against Husserl\u2019s transcendental idealism. As I will discuss\nin \u00a73.1 below, Ingarden\u2019s work in aesthetics was actually\nmotivated by his interest in the realism/idealism problem. His studies\nin fiction and the ontology of art were intended to form part of a\nlarge-scale argument against transcendental idealism, based in\nemphasizing the difference between \u2018real\u2019 entities entirely\nindependent of our minds, and social and cultural entities that (as\n\u2018purely intentional objects\u2019) owe their existence, at least\nin part, to human consciousness \u2014 thus showing that, in virtue of the\nvery meanings of the ideas involved, the \u2018real world\u2019 as a\nwhole cannot be properly treated as a purely intentional object that owes\nits existence to consciousness.\n\n\nIn developing a positive position, Ingarden sought a middle path\nbetween the reductive physicalist realisms popular among analytic\nphilosophers, and the transcendental idealism adopted by Husserl,\nrejecting the simplistic bifurcation between entities that are\n\u2018mind-independent\u2019 and those that are \u2018merely\nsubjective\u2019. His most important and lasting contribution may lie\nin providing a richer ontological framework that could track the\ndifferent ways in which many objects of the \u2018life-world\u2019 of\ndaily experience depend on human intentionality and on mind-independent\nreality, and in developing a moderate realist position that offered\nroom not only for independent physical reality and for consciousness,\nbut also for the whole variety of life-world objects that owe their\nexistence, in part, to both.\n",
