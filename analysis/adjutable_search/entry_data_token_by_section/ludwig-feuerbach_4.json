    "main_text": "The \u201cNew\u201d Philosophy\n5. The \u201cNew\u201d Philosophy\n\nIn notes for lectures on the history of modern philosophy that he\ndelivered in 1835/36, Feuerbach wrote that idealism is the \u201cone\ntrue philosophy\u201d, and that \u201cwhat is not spirit is\nnothing\u201d (VGP 139). Around the same time, he\nvigorously defended the \u201cabsolute method\u201d employed by\nHegel in his Logic against its critics (GW 8:73).\nFeuerbach himself referred to his early philosophical\n\u201cstandpoint\u201d as \u201cthe standpoint of pantheistic\nidentity\u201d (GW 10:291). His efforts to extricate himself\nfrom this standpoint were ongoing over the course of two decades. The\nextent to which they ultimately succeeded is debatable. Whereas the\nyoung Marx saw Feuerbach as \u201cthe true conqueror of the\nold philosophy\u201d, the neo-Kantian historian of\nmaterialism, F.A. Lange, could find in his \u201cnew\u201d\nphilosophy only another iteration of the philosophy of spirit,\n\u201cwhich we encounter here in the form of a philosophy of\nsensuousness\u201d that lacks materialistic bona fides (Marx 1844:\n80; Lange [1866] 1974: v. 2,\n 522).[19]\n\n\nIn 1839, the same year that Feuerbach made his first public break with\nHegelianism in the essay, \u201cToward a Critique of the Hegelian\nPhilosophy\u201d, he was still able to write that he missed in\nspeculative philosophy \u201cthe element of the empirical, and in\nempiricism the element of speculation\u201d, and to describe his own\nmethod as an effort to conjoin both kinds of philosophical\n\u201cactivity\u201d into a form of \u201cskepticism or\ncritique just as much of the merely speculative as\nof the merely empirical\u201d (GW 9:12). It was\nonly in 1842, between the time of the publication of the first (1841)\nand second (1843) editions of The Essence of Christianity\n(which happens also to have been a time of draconian censorship and\npolice surveillance) that Feuerbach became convinced of the need to\nmake a \u201cradical break\u201d with the speculative philosophical\n tradition.[20]\n This prompted him to report in the preface to the second edition of\nhis famous book that \u201cthe Idea\u201d retained for him only a\npractical significance as \u201cfaith in the historical future\u201d\nand in the triumph of truth and virtue. In the realm of theoretical\nphilosophy proper, and \u201cin complete opposition to the Hegelian\nphilosophy,\u201d he now considered himself a realist and a\nmaterialist (WC 15).\n\nIn two brief philosophical manifestos published in 1842 and 1843,\nrespectively, Feuerbach sought to \u201cdeduce\u201d, through an\ninternal criticism of the \u201cold\u201d philosophy (culminating in\nthe Hegelian system), the \u201cprinciples\u201d\n(Grunds\u00e4tze) that would lay the foundation for a\n\u201cnew\u201d, naturalistic \u201cphilosophy of the\nfuture\u201d. After the publication of these two manifestos, however,\nhe turned his attention back to religion, claiming in the foreword to\nthe first volume of his collected works (1846) that it was only in his\nbook on The Essence of Faith According to Luther (1844) that\nhe came to appreciate the \u201ctruth and essentiality of\nsensuousness [Sinnlichkeit]\u201d (GW 10:187), and\nthereby to overcome the \u201ccontradiction\u201d between\nspeculation and empiricism in which his position in The Essence of\nChristianity had remained mired. It is certainly the case that a\nnumber of concepts that are central to the philosophical anthropology\nwith which Feuerbach sought to replace the \u201cold\u201d\nphilosophy, including the effort to \u201cnaturalize freedom\u201d\nundertaken in his final writings, were first introduced and developed\nin writings on religion published in the 1840s and 1850s. Because of\nthis, it\u2019s difficult to neatly separate a discussion of\nFeuerbach\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d philosophy from his later\ntheorizing about religion. Be that as it may, the first of these\ntopics will be explored in this section and the second in the\nsucceeding section. Feuerbach\u2019s preliminary efforts in his last\nactive years to develop a drive psychology and to naturalize ethics\nwill be considered briefly in the final section.\n\nOne thing that distinguishes Feuerbach\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d\nphilosophy from other versions of modern empiricism and materialism is\nhis claim to have derived the \u201cprinciples\u201d of this\nphilosophy through a dialectical inversion of the Hegelian system. In\nthe \u201cTheses\u201d Feuerbach argues that, by\n\u201cpositing\u201d the human essence \u201coutside of man\u201d\nin the ethereal realm of absolute spirit, the Hegelian philosophy\nperpetuates the theological alienation of human beings from their own\nessence, which he now explicitly equates with subjective spirit. The\nre-appropriation of this abstracted essence by finite, corporeal human\nsubjects cannot be achieved \u201cpositively\u201d [auf positive\nWeg], but only through a \u201ctotal negation\u201d of the\nHegelian philosophy that will reveal once and for all the\nincarnational telos of the history of philosophy and humanity\n(VT 247). In this way, Feuerbach thinks, the hidden\n\u201ctruth of Christianity\u201d (VT 263) will finally be\nrealized in the form of an atheistic humanism that renounces the\nfantastical consolations of religion in order to embrace the\nhistorical tasks of human self-realization and the creation of new\npolitical and cultural institutions that will be conducive to it.\n\nIn 1846, Feuerbach published a number of \u201cfragments\u201d from\nhis unpublished papers intended to document the course of his\nphilosophical development. One of these fragments, entitled\n\u201cDoubt\u201d, and dated 1827\u201328 (which is the time when\nFeuerbach was writing his doctoral dissertation) seems already to\nanticipate Feuerbach\u2019s later critique of Hegel. In this\nfragment, we find him questioning the transition from the first to the\nsecond part of Hegel\u2019s tripartite philosophical system, i.e.,\nthe transition from the Logic to the Philosophy of Nature. The\nconceptual process traced by Hegel in the Logic, whereby the\ncategories of thought are successively deduced from one another, is\ndriven by the negativity of the logical determinations of each of\nthese categories, until the process culminates in the absolute Idea.\nBut what negativity remains within the absolute Idea to propel the\ntransition from thought to being, Feuerbach wonders, unless it is that\nthe purportedly \u201cabsolute\u201d Idea remains unrealized, and\nhence incomplete, until it becomes incarnate in the realm of the\nsensuous, i.e., nature? In that case, however, nature itself (as the\nrealm of the sensuous) is the hidden truth of the Idea.\n\nThe speculative claim for the identity of thought and being was the\ncornerstone of the Hegelian philosophy in which Feuerbach finds the\n\u201cold\u201d philosophy perfected. One of the principal\n\u201ctheses\u201d of the new philosophy is its repudiation of this\nclaim. Feuerbach argues that, because the concept of pure being with\nwhich Hegel begins the Logic is an abstraction, in the end\nHegel succeeds only in reconciling thought with the thought of being,\nrather than with being itself, which is the \u201cother\u201d of\nthought. The new philosophy affirms that being is distinct from, and\nprior to, thought, and that it is as various as is the panoply of\nindividually existing beings, from which it cannot be intelligibly\ndistinguished.\n\n\nThought comes from being, but being does not come from thought.\n[\u2026] The essence of being as being [i.e., in contrast\nto the mere thought of being] is the essence of nature.\n(VT 258/168)\n\n\nTo say that something exists in actuality is to say that it exists not\nonly as a figment of someone\u2019s imagination, or as a mere\ndetermination of their consciousness, but for itself, independently of\nconsciousness. \u201cBeing is something in which not only I but also\nothers, above all also the object itself, participate\u201d\n(GPZ 304/40). In affirming the distinction between thought\nand being, repudiating Hegel\u2019s critique of sense certainty, and\naffirming the claim that nature exists through itself, independently\nof thought, the new philosophy also affirms the reality of time and\nspace, insisting that real existence is finite, determinate, corporeal\nexistence. Whereas, in his lectures on logic and metaphysics, and in\nhis writings from the mid-1830\u2019s, Feuerbach had defended the\nHegelian method of the logical Entwicklung or development of\nthe various moments of the absolute Idea, he now argues that the\nconcept of development entails or presupposes temporality, so that a\nnon-temporal developmental process is a contradiction in terms. If\nspeculative philosophy is the philosophy of the infinite, the new\nphilosophy aims to disclose the truth of finitude by reversing the\npath taken by speculation from the infinite to the finite, and from\nthe indeterminate to the determinate (VT 249).\n\nAlthough, in the \u201cTheses\u201d, Feuerbach refers to\n\u201cspeculative philosophy\u201d as having been inaugurated by\nSpinoza, revived by Schelling, and perfected by Hegel (VT\n243), in Principles he locates the origin of this tradition\nin the Cartesian philosophy, and specifically in \u201cthe\nabstraction from the sensuous [Sinnlichkeit], from\nmatter\u201d (GPZ 275/ 13) through which the conception of\nthe cogito first arose. Much of the content of Principles\nconsists of a truncated survey of the history of modern philosophy\nthat purports to trace, through several dialectical inversions, a\nnecessary development from the rationalistic theism of Descartes and\nLeibniz through the pantheism of Spinoza to the idealism of Kant and\nFichte, culminating in Hegel\u2019s philosophy of identity. What this\nsurvey is primarily intended to show is that the fundamental tendency\nof this development has been toward the actualization and humanization\nof God or, alternatively, toward\n\n\nthe divinization of the real, of the materially\nexistent\u2014of materialism, empiricism, realism,\nhumanism\u2014[and] the negation of theology. (GPZ 285/\n22)\n\n\nThis survey is followed by a short \u201cdemonstration\u201d of the\nhistorical necessity of the new philosophy, which takes the form of a\ncritique of Hegel, and by the enumeration of several doctrines that\ndistinguish the new philosophy from the old.\n\nWhereas earlier rationalists had conceived of God as existing prior\nto, and independently of, nature, and as possessing perfect knowledge\nuntainted by materiality; and had, further, \u201cplaced the effort\nand labor of abstraction and of self-liberation from the sensuous only\nin themselves\u201d, Feuerbach views Hegel as having been the first\nto transform \u201cthis subjective activity into the self-activity of\nthe divine being.\u201d Thus, for Hegel, like the heroes of pagan\nantiquity, God (or the Idea) must \u201cfight through virtue for his\ndivinity\u201d, and only comes to be for himself (or itself) at the\nend of a lengthy and laborious process (GPZ 296/32). This\nprocess, as it is described by Hegel at the end of the Science of\nLogic, involves the logical Idea\n\n\nfreely releas[ing] itself \u2026 [into] the\nexternality of space and time existing absolutely on its own\nwithout the moment of subjectivity. (Hegel [1812\u20131816] 1969:\n843)\n\n\nWhat Feuerbach refers to as \u201cthe liberation of the absolute from\nmatter\u201d is achieved as spirit gradually distinguishes itself\nfrom nature before attaining to the awareness of itself as absolute.\nHere, Feuerbach notes, \u201cmatter is indeed posited in God, that\nis, it is posited as God\u201d, and to posit matter as God is to\naffirm atheism and materialism, but insofar as the\nself-externalization of the Idea in nature is superseded in the course\nof the coming-to-be-for-itself of the Idea in the forms of subjective,\nobjective and absolute spirit, this negation of \u201ctheology\u201d\n(i.e., of God conceived as an immaterial being distinct from nature)\nis negated in turn. This is what Feuerbach seems to have in mind when\nhe refers to Hegel\u2019s philosophy as\n\n\nthe last magnificent attempt to restore Christianity, which was lost\nand wrecked, through philosophy \u2026 by identifying it with the\nnegation of Christianity. (GPZ 297/34)\n\n\nThe new philosophy categorically affirms the embodied nature of human\nsubjectivity and self-consciousness. Whereas the old philosophy\nconceived of the cogito as \u201can abstract and merely a thinking\nbeing to whose essence the body does not belong\u201d (GPZ\n319\u2013320/ 54), the new philosophy affirms that, as a thinking\nsubject, \u201cI am a real, sensuous being and, indeed, the body in\nits totality is my ego, my essence itself\u201d (ibid.). Although it\nis not entirely clear just what Feuerbach could mean in claiming that\n\u201cthe body in its totality is my ego\u201d, elsewhere he says\nthat to affirm that the ego is corporeal \u201chas no other meaning\nthan that the ego is not only active but also passive \u2026 [and\nthat] the passivity of the ego is the activity of the object\u201d in\nsuch a way that \u201cthe object belongs to the innermost being of\nthe ego\u201d (AP 150/142). Object and ego are thus, to use\na Heideggerian term, gleichursprunglich or\n\u201cequiprimordial\u201d.\n\n\nIt is through the body that the ego is not just an ego but also an\nobject. To be embodied is to be in the world; it means to have so many\nsenses, i.e., so many pores and naked surfaces. The body is nothing\nbut the porous ego. (AP 151/143)\n\n\nIf philosophical thought is to avoid remaining \u201ca prisoner of\nthe ego\u201d, Feuerbach insists, it \u201cmust begin with its\nantithesis, with its alter ego\u201d (AP\n146/138). The antithesis of thought is sensation. Whereas, in\nthinking, it is the object that is determined by the thinking activity\nof the subject, in sense experience, Feuerbach insists (without much\nargument and with apparently little concern for problems that\npreoccupied the British empiricists and Kant), the consciousness of\nthe subject is determined by the activity of the object. The object\ncan thus be said to function as a subject in its own right. What makes\nit possible for the ego to posit the object is only that, in positing\nthe object as something distinct from itself, the ego is at the same\ntime posited by the object. If, however, the\n\n\nthe object is not only something posited, but also (to continue in\nthis abstract language) something which itself posits, then it is\nclear that the presuppositionless ego, which excludes the object from\nitself and negates it, is only a presupposition of the subjective ego\nagainst which the object must protest. (AP 147/ 139)\n\n\nIt is not to the I, but to the not-I within the I, that real, sensuous\nobjects are given. Memory is what first enables us to transform\nobjects of sense experience into objects of thought, so that what is\nno longer present to the senses can nevertheless be recalled to\nconsciousness. In doing so, it allows us to transcend the limitations\nof time and space in thought, and to construct, from a multitude of\ndistinct sense experiences, a conception of the universe as a whole,\nand of our relations to the various other beings that exist in it.\nFeuerbach continues to affirm that, unlike the animals,\n\u201cman\u201d is a universal, cosmopolitan being. However, he now\nmaintains that we need not ascribe to human beings any unique\nsupersensible faculty in order to affirm this truth, since\n\n\nwherever a sense is elevated above the limits of particularity and its\nbondage to needs, it is elevated to an independent and theoretical\nsignificance and dignity; universal sense is intelligence\n[Verstand]; universal sensibility, mentality\n[Geistigkeit]. (GPZ 336/69)\n\n\nWhat distinguishes humans from non-human animals is thus not our\npossession of non-natural powers, either of reason or volition, but\nthe fact that human beings are \u201cabsolute sensualists\u201d\nwhose collective powers of observation and recollection extend, in\nprinciple, to the whole of nature.\n",
