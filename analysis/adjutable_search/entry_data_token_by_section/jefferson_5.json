    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || The \u201cMother Principle\u201d\n4.1 The \u201cMother Principle\u201d\n\nIn his First Inaugural Address (1801), Jefferson lists the\n\u201cessential principles of our Government\u201d in 15\ndoctrines\u2014perhaps his first attempt at a definition of\nrepublicanism ([I1]: 494\u201395).\n\nEqual and exact justice to all men, irrespective of political or\nreligious persuasion;\npeace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, without\nentangling alliances to any;\nFederal support in the rights of states\u2019 government;\npreservation of constitutional vigor of the Federal\ngovernment;\nelection by the people;\nabsolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority;\na well-disciplined militia;\nsupremacy of the civil over the military authority;\nlight taxation;\nready payment of debts;\nencouragement of agriculture and commerce;\nthe diffusion of information and arraignment of all abuses at the\nbar of the public reason;\nfreedom of the press;\nprotection by habeas corpus and trial by juries\nimpartially selected; and\nfreedom of religion.\n\n\nFifteen years later in a series of letters, Jefferson again grapples\nwith a definition of \u201crepublicanism.\u201d To P.S. Dupont de\nNemours (24 Apr. 1816), Jefferson lists nine \u201cmoral\nprinciples\u201d upon which republican government is grounded.\n\n\nI believe with you that morality, compassion, generosity, are innate\nelements of the human constitution; that there exists a right\nindependent of force; that a right to property is founded in our\nnatural wants, in the means with which we are endowed to satisfy these\nwants, and the right to what we acquire by those means without\nviolating the similar rights of other sensible beings; that no one has\na right to obstruct another, exercising his faculties innocently for\nthe relief of sensibilities made a part of his nature; that justice is\nthe fundamental law of society; that the majority, oppressing an\nindividual, is guilty of a crime, abuses its strength, and by acting\non the law of the strongest breaks up the foundations of society; that\naction by the citizens in person, in affairs within their reach and\ncompetence, and in all others by representatives, chosen immediately,\nand removable by themselves, constitutes the essence of a republic;\nthat all governments are more or less republican in proportion as this\nprinciple enters more or less into their composition; and that a\ngovernment by representation is capable of extension over a greater\nsurface of country than one of any other form.\n\n\nAmong the nine principles, the seventh\n\n\nAction by the citizens in person, in affairs within their reach and\ncompetence, and in all others by representatives, chosen immediately,\nand removable by themselves, constitutes the essence of a\nrepublic.\n\n\ncomes closest to the essence of republicanism. To John Taylor (28 May\n1816), Jefferson attempts a \u201cprecise and definite idea\u201d of\nrepublicanism:\n\n\nA government by its citizens in mass, acting directly and personally,\naccording to rules established by the majority.\n\n\nHe adds,\n\n\nEvery other government is more or less republican, in proportion as it\nhas in this composition more or less of this ingredient of the direct\naction of the citizens.\n\n\nTo Samuel Kercheval (12 July 1816), Jefferson gives his \u201cmother\nprinciple\u201d:\n\n\nGovernments are republican only in proportion as they embody the will\nof their people, and execute it. \n\n\nHe adds,\n\n\nA government is republican in proportion as every member composing it\nhas his equal voice in the direction of its concerns (not indeed in\nperson, which would be impracticable beyond the limits of a city, or\nsmall township, but) by representatives chosen by himself, and\nresponsible to him at short periods).\n\n\nSuch writings suggest the following \u201cbarebones\u201d definition\nof \u201crepublic\u201d for Jefferson, or a \u201cJeffersonian\nrepublic\u201d:\n\n\nA government is a Jeffersonian republic if and only if it allows all\ncitizens ample opportunity to participate politically in affairs\nwithin their reach and competency; it employs representatives, chosen\nand recallable by the citizenry and functioning for short periods, for\naffairs outside citizens\u2019 reach and competency; it functions\naccording to the rules (periodically revisable) established by the\nmajority of the citizens; and it guarantees the equal rights, in\nperson and property, of all citizens.\n\n\nThe definition is barebones for several reasons. First, it does not\nfully capture the normative essence of Jefferson\u2019s description\nof what is \u201cproper for all conditions of society\u201d in his\nletter to Dupont de Nemours. Yet it is not normatively neutral, as it\nspeaks of equality of opportunity for each citizen to participate in\ngovernment and it guarantees equal rights. Second, the definition\nignores the partnership of politics and science, which is part of\nJefferson\u2019s conception of a republic. Jefferson insisted on\nperiodic revisions of the Constitution at conventions to accommodate\nchanges in the peoples\u2019 will, when suitably informed. Such\nchanges were not arbitrary, but dictated mostly by advances in\n science.[21]\n Jefferson writes to Samuel Kercheval (12 July 1816), \u201cThe laws\nand constitutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human\nmind.\u201d Thus, a republic for Jefferson is essentially progressive\nand scientific, not static and conservative.\n\nThus, Jeffersonian republicanism is a schema for government\nby the people, not any particular system of\ngoverning. It is not wedded to any particular\nconstitution\u2014constitutions, Jefferson is clear, are merely\nprovisional representations of the will of the people at the time of\ntheir drafting (TJ to George Washington, 7 Nov. 1792)\u2014but to the\nprinciple of government representing the will of the people, suitably\ninformed. That is why Jefferson says in his First Inaugural Address\nthat for the will of the majority to be reasonable, it must be\nrightful ([I1]:\n 493).[22]\n Thus, Jeffersonian republicanism is essentially in partnership with\nscience.\n\nJefferson\u2019s attempts at defining \u201crepublic\u201d and his\nnine moral principles \u201cproper for all conditions of\nsociety\u201d shows that republicanism is a political philosophy. For\nJefferson, republican governing is essentially progressive, and being\ngovernment of and for the people, it aims at involving all citizens to\ntheir fullest capacity. Over the centuries, he recognized, human\npotentiality had been stifled by coercive governments. Instantiation\nof republican governing, thus, was an attempt to impose the minimal\npolitical structure needed to maximize human liberty, free human\npotentiality, and ensure the political ascendency of the\n\u201cnatural aristoi,\u201d the talented and virtuous, and\nnot the \u201cartificial aristoi,\u201d the wealthy and\nwellborn.\n",
