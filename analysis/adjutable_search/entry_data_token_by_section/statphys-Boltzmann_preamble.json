    "main_text": "\n\n\nLudwig Boltzmann (1844\u20131906) is generally acknowledged as one of\nthe most important physicists of the nineteenth century. Particularly\nfamous is his statistical explanation of the second law of\nthermodynamics. The celebrated formula \\(S = k \\log W\\), expressing a\nrelation between entropy \\(S\\) and probability \\(W\\) has been engraved\non his tombstone (even though he never actually wrote this formula\ndown). Boltzmann's views on statistical physics continue to play an\nimportant role in contemporary debates on the foundations of that\ntheory.\n\n\nHowever, Boltzmann's ideas on the precise relationship between the\nthermodynamical properties of macroscopic bodies and their microscopic\nconstitution, and the role of probability in this relationship are\ninvolved and differed quite remarkably in different periods of his\nlife. Indeed, in his first paper in statistical physics of 1866, he\nclaimed to obtain a completely general theorem from mechanics that\nwould prove the second law. However, thirty years later he stated that\nthe second law could never be proved by mechanical means alone, but\ndepended essentially on probability theory. In his lifelong struggle\nwith the problem he employed a varying arsenal of tools and\nassumptions. (To mention a few: the so-called Sto\u00dfzahlansatz,\nthe ergodic hypothesis, ensembles, the combinatorial argument, the\nhypothesis of molecular disorder.) However, the exact role of these\nassumptions, and the results he obtained from them, also shifted in\nthe course of time.  Particularly notorious are the role of the\nergodic hypothesis and the status of the so-called H-theorem.\nMoreover, he used \u2018probability\u2019 in four different\ntechnical meanings.  It is, therefore, not easy to speak of a\nconsistent, single \u201cBoltzmannian approach\u201d to statistical physics. It\nis the purpose of this essay to describe the evolution of a selection\nof these approaches and their conceptual problems.\n",
