    "main_text": "Conclusion || The Sublunary World: Matter and Evil\n6.2 The Sublunary World: Matter and Evil\n\nWithout Avicenna\u2019s attempting to provide a philosophical reason\nfor it (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 4, 407, 4\u20138;\nI\u0161\u0101r\u0101t, ed. Duny\u0101, III, 228\u2013230),\nthe last intelligence does not lead to a further intelligence but\ninstead looks after the sublunary world and human beings. Indeed, the\nlast intelligence provides forms for the sublunary world.\nCalled\u2014with an expression that was to be in great favor in the\nLatin medieval world (which came to know it also through\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b) \u201cbestower\u201d or \u201cgiver of\nforms\u201d (dator formarum; Arabic: w\u0101hib\nal-\u1e63uwar; but, for Avicenna, this name can be applied to\nall intelligences: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 5, 411; 413), the\nlast Intelligence or Agent Intellect (al-\u02bfaql\nal-fa\u02bf\u02bf\u0101l) represents the principle of the\nphysical constitution of the world as well as the founding principle\nof human intellection (which at least in some texts Avicenna explains\nthrough the idea of donation). In general terms, the sublunary world\nis explained by means of the metaphysical structures used by\nAristotle: matter and form, potentiality and act. These structures are\nnevertheless sustained by the emanative pattern which explains the\nworld not only as regards its origin, but also as regards its\n\u201clife\u201d: generations and natural transformations are\nconceived as the result of a process by which matter becomes\nspecifically prepared to receive the gift of forms from above. So to\nthe active donation of forms by the Agent Intellect, Avicenna adds the\ninfluence of the spheres, the mutual interactions of the sublunary\nelements as preparatory causes and the reception of matter. The\ndynamic ideas of potency and act are thus elaborated and complicated:\nthe idea of potency\u2014quwwa\u2014to which Avicenna adds\nthose of preparation (isti\u02bfd\u0101d) and specific or\nproper preparation (isti\u02bfd\u0101d\n\u1e2b\u0101\u1e63\u1e63)\u2014is interpreted in the light of\nemanation: the potency of matter is reception in time and is in fact\npossibility in time. In the temporal dimension of the sublunary\nworld\u2014where what becomes is something after not having been it,\npossibility requires a substratum (matter) and becomes material\npotency: it thus explains a non-eternal thing, which is brought into\nexistence \u201cafter being non-existent\u201d\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IV, 2, 181, 7\u201312).\n",
