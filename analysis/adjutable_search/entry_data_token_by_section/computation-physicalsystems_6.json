    "main_text": "Accounts of Concrete Computation || The Mechanistic Account\n2.5 The Mechanistic Account\n\nThe mechanistic account (Piccinini 2007, 2015; cf. Kaplan 2011,\nMilkowski 2013, Fresco 2014, Duwell 2017, Coelho Mollo 2018,\nCurtis-Trudel forthcoming-b) avoids appealing to both syntax and\nsemantics. Instead, it accounts for concrete computation in terms of\nthe mechanistic properties of a system. According to the mechanistic\naccount, concrete computing systems are functional mechanisms of a\nspecial kind\u2014mechanisms that perform concrete computations.\n\nA functional mechanism is a system of organized components, each of\nwhich has functions to perform (cf. Craver 2012, Garson 2013). When\nappropriate components and their functions are appropriately organized\nand functioning properly, their combined activities constitute the\ncapacities of the mechanism. Conversely, when we look for an\nexplanation of the capacities of a mechanism, we decompose the\nmechanism into its components and look for their functions and\norganization. The result is a mechanistic explanation of the\nmechanism\u2019s capacities.\n\nThis notion of mechanism is familiar to biologists and engineers. Both\nexplain capacities of the system in question (e.g., digestion or\nrespiration for the biologist, memory access or multiplication for the\ncomputer engineer) in terms of the functions performed by systems of\norganized components (e.g., the digestive system and the respiratory\nsystem, or the memory system and the processor).\n\nAccording to the mechanistic account, a computation in the generic\nsense is the processing of vehicles according to rules that are\nsensitive to certain vehicle properties and, specifically, to\ndifferences between different portions of the vehicles. The processing\nis performed by a functional mechanism, that is, a mechanism whose\ncomponents are functionally organized to perform the computation.\nThus, if the mechanism malfunctions, a miscomputation occurs.\n\nDigital computation, analog computation, etc. turn out to be species\nof generic computation. They are differentiated by more specific\nproperties of the vehicles being processed. If a computing system\nprocesses strings of discrete states, then it performs a digital\ncomputation. If a computing system processes variables that can be\ncontinuous, then it performs an analog computation (but see Maley,\nforthcoming, for an alternative account). If a computing system\nprocesses qubits, then it performs a quantum computation.\n\nWhen we define concrete computations and the vehicles that they\nmanipulate, we need not consider all of their specific physical\nproperties, but only those properties that are relevant to the\ncomputation, according to the rules that define the computation. A\nphysical system can be described more or less abstractly. According to\nthe mechanistic account, an abstract description of a physical system\nis not a description of an abstract object but rather a description of\na concrete system that omits certain details. Descriptions of concrete\ncomputations and their vehicles are sufficiently abstract as to be\ndefined independently of the physical media that implement them in\nparticular cases. Because of this, concrete computations and their\nvehicles are sometimes said to be \u2018medium-independent\u2019 or\n\u2018substrate neutral\u2019.\n\nIn other words, a vehicle is medium-independent just in case the rules\n(i.e., the input-output maps) that define the relevant computation are\nsensitive only to differences between portions of the vehicles along\nspecific dimensions of variation\u2014they are insensitive to any\nmore concrete physical properties of the vehicles. Put yet another\nway, the rules are functions of state variables associated with a set\nof functionally relevant degrees of freedom, which can be implemented\ndifferently in different physical media. Thus, a given computation can\nbe implemented in multiple physical media (e.g., mechanical,\nelectro-mechanical, electronic, magnetic, etc.), provided that the\nmedia possess a sufficient number of dimensions of variation (or\ndegrees of freedom) that can be appropriately accessed and manipulated\nand that the components of the mechanism are functionally organized in\nthe appropriate way.\n\nLike the semantic and syntactic accounts, the mechanistic account aims\nto avoid pancomputationalism. First, physical systems that are not\nfunctional mechanisms are ruled out. Functional mechanisms are complex\nsystems of components that are organized to perform functions. Any\nsystem whose components are not organized to perform functions is not\na computing system because it is not a functional mechanism. Second,\nmechanisms that lack the function of manipulating medium-independent\nvehicles are ruled out. Finally, medium-independent vehicle\nmanipulators whose manipulations fail to accord with appropriate rules\nare ruled out. The second and third constraints appeal to special\nfunctional properties\u2014manipulating medium-independent vehicles,\ndoing so in accordance with rules defined over the vehicles\u2014that\nare possessed only by relatively few physical systems. According to\nthe mechanistic account, those few systems are the genuine computing\nsystems.\n\nAnother feature of the mechanistic account is that it accounts for the\npossibility of miscomputation\u2014a possibility difficult to make\nsense of under other accounts. To illustrate the point, consider an\nordinary computer programmed to compute function f on input\ni. Suppose that the computer malfunctions and produces an\noutput different from f(i). According to the causal\n(semantic) account, the computer just underwent a causal process (a\nmanipulation of representations), which may be given a computational\ndescription and hence counts as computing some function\ng(i), where g \u2260 f. By contrast,\naccording to the mechanistic account, the computer simply failed to\ncompute, or at least it failed to complete its computation correctly.\nGiven the importance of avoiding miscomputations in the design and use\nof computers, the ability of the mechanistic account to make sense of\nmiscomputation may be an advantage over rival accounts (Dewhurst 2018,\nTucker 2018).\n\nA final feature of the mechanistic account is that it precisely\ndistinguishes and characterizes many different kinds of computing\nsystems based on the specific vehicles they manipulate and their\nspecific mechanistic properties. The mechanistic account has been used\nto explicate digital computation, analog computation, computation by\nneural networks, and other important distinctions such as hardwired\nvs. programmable and serial vs. parallel computation (Piccinini\n2015).\n",
