    "main_text": "Other Enrichments of SDL || Other Modalities\n5.3 Other Modalities\n\nAside from the preceding operators in this section, there are a number\nof other types of modal operators one could sensibly add to a given\ndeontic logic. Far from being exhaustive, let us just give a few\nexamples and mention well-known issues that arise from such\nenrichments.\n\nIn some normative systems (e.g., legal systems), explicit permissions,\nprohibitions and obligations are given. So it would seem to be\npossible for there to be normative systems with gaps: systems where\nsomething is neither explicitly obligatory, impermissible, nor\npermissible because, say, it is neither explicitly commanded,\nprohibited or permitted by the relevant authority. For instance, it\nmay well have been undecided, legally speaking, whether storing\nsomeone\u2019s search data on a website was permissible or not prior\nto any new law being cast to regulate this practice. Yet \\(\\OB p\n\\vee(\\PE p \\amp \\PE \\neg p) \\vee \\IM p\\) is a thesis\n(\u201cexhaustion\u201d) of SDL (given the Traditional Definitional\nScheme), which makes any such gaps impossible. There is no place for\nthis fourth category in SDL, as it does not allow for such\nnormative gaps (von Wright\n 1968).[75]\n SDL is not designed to represent a notion of explicitly stated\nobligations, permissions, etc.\n\nOne way to accommodate gaps, without revising the Traditional\nDefinitional Scheme or the underlying logic of the classical\nconnectives, is by enriching SDL with a modal operator \\(\\NS\\) that\nrefers explicitly to the normative system at hand: \\(\\NS\\OB p\\) then\nmeans something like \u201caccording to the normative system, \\(p\\)\nis obligatory\u201d. Normative gaps can be expressed by such\nsentences as \n\n\\[\\neg \\NS\\OB p \\amp \\neg \\NS (\\PE p \\amp \\PE \\neg p) \\amp \\neg \\NS\\IM p.\\]\n\n\nNote that this is perfectly consistent with the claim \n\n\\[\\NS (\\OB p \\vee(\\PE p \\amp \\PE \\neg p) \\vee \\IM p),\\]\n\n\nwhich just says that according to the normative system, the\nproposition \\(p\\) is either obligatory, optional, or\n impermissible.[76]\n\nOther types of modalities that display interesting interaction with\ndeontic notions are temporal modalities. For instance, it is plausible\nto think that one is obligated to do something only if that\nthing is in the future. This suggests that the deontic necessity\noperator quantifies over states that form a subset of the set of all\nfuture states; and hence a principle of the type\n\n(FO)\n If in all future states, \\(p\\) is the case, then \\(\\OB p\\)\n\n\nshould hold. Similar observations can be made in terms of the\nAndersonian-Kangerian reduction of SDL. If we read the deontic\nconstant \\(d\\) atemporally as \u201call obligations past, present,\nand future are met\u201d, then the only relevant worlds are those so\nideal that in them there has never been a single violation of a\nmandatory norm. But as a parent, I may be obligated to lock the front\ndoor at night even though this would not be a norm unless there had\nbeen past violations of other norms (e.g., against theft and murder).\nPeople also acquire obligations over time, create them for themselves\nand for others, discharge them,\n etc.[77]\n\nFinally, one may also combine deontic and epistemic or doxastic\nlogics. Such combinations may serve two distinct aims: to capture\ndistinctively epistemic obligations such as \u201cJane ought to know\nthat there is no cure to this illness (as she is a doctor)\u201d, or\nto study subjective, knowledge-dependent obligations as in\n\u201cGiven what you know about their production, you ought not to\nbuy these clothes\u201d. For a famous puzzle concerning the first\ntype of extension, see supplement F on\n the Paradox of Epistemic Obligation.\n\nFor the second type of extension, a recent puzzle that has received\nmuch attention is the so-called Miners Paradox (Kolodny &\nMacFarlane 2010; Parfit ms. [see\n Other Internet Resources]).\n A proposal for dealing with the latter in the context of deontic STIT\nlogic can be found in Horty 2019; earlier proposals for dealing with\nknowledge-based obligations are Pacuit, Parikh and Cogan 2006 and\nBroersen 2008. Clearly, however fundamental the monadic operators\nrepresented in SDL, they are but a fragment of those employed in\nnormative discourse.\n",
