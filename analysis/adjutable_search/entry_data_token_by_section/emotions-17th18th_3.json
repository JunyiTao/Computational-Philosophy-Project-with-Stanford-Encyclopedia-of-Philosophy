    "main_text": "The Context of Early Modern Theories of the Passions || Taxonomies\n2.2 Taxonomies\n\nSeventeenth-century accounts are rife with long inventories of\nemotions, although the list-making urge seems to have dampened a bit\nby the eighteenth century, with many fewer authors pretending to\nexhaustive catalogues. Compared to his contemporaries, Descartes looks\ntemperate with a docket of a mere six simple passions, although he\nalso constructed a host of complex ones out of these six. Hobbes\noffered a list of about thirty in the Leviathan (1651), and\nmore than twenty-five in The Elements of Law (ms. 1640). The\nhead count for Spinoza is a bit trickier to determine, but the third\nbook of his Ethics (ms. 1675) defines at least forty affects.\nLocke\u2019s short discussion in Book II, chap. XX of the Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding (1690) treats eleven; whereas\nHume\u2019s Treatise and \u201cDissertation on the Passions\u201d\n(1757) described about ten broad passions, as well as numerous\nsub-species and adjuncts, even before turning to the moral or\naesthetic sentiments. This tendency is not simply found among the\ngreat early modern systems-builders. In the seventeenth century in\nparticular, just about everybody (and their maiden aunt and bachelor\nuncle) seems to have joined in the hunt for new and distinctive lists\nof emotions. For instance, large portions of Thomas Wright\u2019s The\nPassions of the Mind In General (1604) and Nicholas Coeffeteau\u2019s\nTableau des passions humaines, de leurs causes et leurs\neffets (ms. 1621) are devoted to such lists. A short play of\n1630, Pathomachia; or the Battel of Affections, even makes\nproper taxonomy the motor of what little drama it possesses.\n\nThe proliferation of lists can be at least partly explained by the\nproliferation of schemes of classification. Again, the attention to\nprinciples of classification is most marked in the seventeenth-century\ntheorists, in part because of the taxonomic connections they saw\nbetween the treatment of the passions and their scientific ambitions\nin other areas, and in part because of the attacks launched against\nthe systems of previous, e.g., scholastic, thinkers. Descartes, for\ninstance, singled out Aquinas\u2019s division of the passions into the\nconcupiscible and irascible for express and explicit criticism. But\nmaking his case required constructing an alternative classification\nmore in accord with his reformist account of the soul and its\nfaculties. Despite the efforts of those on the cutting edge of passion\ntheory, however, the Aquinian distinction remained a commonplace bit\nof early modern folk psychology, as we can see in Wright, Burton, and\neven Henry More. Then too, many early modern authors borrowed, and\nborrowed heavily, from Stoic and Thomist classifications. Hobbes and\nLocke, for instance, both drew from Aquinas\u2019s enumeration of eleven\npassions, as did Jacques Bossuet in Trait\u00e9 de la\nconnaissance de Dieu et de soi-m\u00eame (ms. after 1670; see\nGardiner 1970, 205).\n\nMany time-honored principles of classification clearly decreased in\nimportance during the early modern period. In particular, the\npossibility of psychic conflict, especially that which could generate\ncompeting motives for action, had been a common device in ancient and\nmedieval theories for distinguishing among passions, kinds of\npassions, and faculties of the soul in general. This principle played\nsome role for Descartes in distinguishing between movements coming\nfrom the body and those originating in the soul, and it was deployed\nsporadically by other theorists. But the practice died out over the\ncourse of the two centuries, as theorists came to recognize the\npossibility that a single, or similar, emotional source might produce\nconflicting motions or tendencies, both in the individual and across\nsocieties. Indeed, some emotions were characterized exactly by such\nconflict or turbulence. Descartes\u2019s description of regret is one such\nexample. A somewhat happier case is the emotions generated by tragedy,\nas explained by philosophers from Malebranche to Hume.\n\nPerhaps the most basic division in play is evaluative, i.e., whether\nthe emotion is good or bad. This was hardly an innovation. But early\nmodern philosophers came to understand that division in two different\nways \u2013 either an emotion is directed at good or evil as an\nobject, or the emotion itself is affectively good or bad, pleasurable\nor painful. Many distinctively modern theories subsumed the former\nunder the latter: both the naturalistic theories of Hobbes and\nSpinoza, on the one hand, and the moral sense theories of Hutcheson\nand Hume, on the other, held that we project the value of the object\nfrom the affective quality of the emotion, although Hume allows for\ncomplications in how we experience the valences of a passion as\nbelonging to self or other, using such mechanisms as sympathy and\ncomparison. Some authors also identified neutral emotions:\n\u2018wonder\u2019 is a common example, deriving largely from\nDescartes, although anticipated in Sir Kenelme Digby\u2019s Two\nTreatises (1644).\n\nSome philosophers singled out a particular passion, or group of\npassions, to head off their taxonomies. In rather different ways, that\nwas the role of wonder for Descartes, and of glory for Hobbes (see\nSchmitter 2017). Malebranche took there to be an irreducible element\nof love in every passion. Mary Astell, in turn, called love of God\n\u201cthe leading and Master Passion\u201d (Letters Concerning\nthe Love of God, Letter VII). An even more common organizing\ndevice was to divide the passions into simple and complex. Not only\ndid this impose a manageable order on the many recognized passions, it\nallowed explanation to be focused on the simplest cases, with the\nexpectation that other emotions would fall into line, either as\ncompounds, offspring, or species of the simples. The simple passions\nthemselves were organized into contrasting groups, based on their\nevaluative character. Schemes of this kind can be found in Descartes,\nMalebranche, Spinoza, Thomas Wright, and to a lesser extent, Hume.\n\nMany other forms of classification were tied closely to the particular\ninterests of individual authors. This is particularly the case with\nthose eighteenth-century British authors who argued against Hobbes (as\nthey understood him) and Mandeville that the very possibility of\nmorality requires that we be capable of genuinely benevolent emotions.\nFor this reason, distinctions between self-directed and other-directed\nemotions and between anti-social and sociable emotions were a common\npoint of organization and contention. Similar concerns also generated\na distinction between idiosyncratic affects and emotions that could be\ncultivated to be broadly shared; in particular, emotions were often\ndivided into the raw and immediate and those that involve an element\nof reflection. This distinction lent itself also to those philosophers\nconcerned with the historical and social development of humans, as\nevident in many works of Rousseau. For instance, the Discourse on\nthe Origin of Inequality (1755) presents a kind of natural\nhistory tracing the genesis of many emotions through changes in social\nstructure; works such as Emile (1762), La Nouvelle\nHeloise (1761), and the Confessions (1782) treat the\naffective maturation and socialization of individuals, as well as the\nmanagement and effects of the emotions. But for all his genealogical\nconcerns, Rousseau, and indeed many other eighteenth-century authors,\nshowed a good deal less interest in taxonomizing the emotions\naccording to principled systems than did their predecessors.\n",
