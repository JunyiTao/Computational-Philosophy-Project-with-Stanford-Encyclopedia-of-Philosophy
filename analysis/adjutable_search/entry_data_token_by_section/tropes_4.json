    "main_text": "The Nature of Tropes || Trope Individuation\n2.3 Trope Individuation\n\nWhat makes two tropes, existing in the same world at the same time,\n distinct?[14]\n\nA natural suggestion is that we take the way we normally identify and\nrefer to tropes very literally and individuate tropes with reference\nto the objects that \u2018have\u2019 them:\n\nObject Individuation (OI):\nFor any tropes a and b such that a exactly\nresembles b, a \u2260 b iff a\nbelongs to an object that is distinct from the object to which\nb belongs.\n\n\nNo trope theorist endorses this natural suggestion, however. The\nreason why not is that, at least if objects are bundles of tropes, the\nindividuation of objects will depend on the individuation of the\ntropes that make them up, which means that, on OI, individuation\nbecomes circular (Lowe 1998: 206f.; Schaffer 2001: 249; Ehring 2011:\n77). Indeed, matters improve only marginally if objects are understood\nas substrates in which tropes are instantiated. For, although on this\nview, OI does not force one to accept a circular account of\nindividuation, this is because it is now the substrate which carries\nthe individuating burden. This leaves the individuation of the\nsubstrate still unaccounted for, and so we appear to have gotten\nnowhere (Mertz 2001). Any trope theorist who accepts the possible\nexistence of \u2018free-floating\u2019 tropes\u2014i.e., tropes\nthat exist unattached to any object\u2014must in any case\nreject this account of trope individuation (at least as long as she\naccepts the possibility of there being more than one\nfree-floating trope at any given time).\n\nThe main-contenders are instead spatiotemporal individuation\n(SI) and primitivist individuation (PI). According to SI,\nfirst, that two tropes belonging to the same world are distinct can be\nmetaphysically explained with reference to a difference in their\nrespective spatiotemporal position (Campbell 1990: 53f.; Lowe 1998:\n207; Schaffer 2001: 249; Giberman 2022: 18):\n\nSpatiotemporal Individuation (SI):\nFor any tropes a and b such that a\nexactly resemble b, a \u2260 b iff a\nis at non-zero distance from b.\n\n\nThis is an account of trope individuation that seems to respect the\nway tropes are normally picked out, yet which does\nnot\u2014circularly\u2014individuate tropes with reference to the\nobjects they make up and which does not rule out the existence of\n\u2018free-floaters\u2019. In spite of this, the majority of the\ntrope theorists (Schaffer 2001 being one important exception) have\nopted instead for primitivism (cf. e.g., Ehring 2011: 76;\nCampbell 1990: 69; Kein\u00e4nen & Hakkarainen 2014). Primitivism\nis best understood as the denial of the idea that there is any true\nand informative way of filling out the biconditional \u2018For any\nexactly resembling tropes a and b, a \u2260\nb iff \u2026\u2019. That a and b are\ndistinct\u2014if they are\u2014is hence primitive. It has no further\n(ontological) analysis or (metaphysical) explanation.\n\nAccording to what is probably the most influential argument in favor\nof PI over SI (an argument that changed Campbell\u2019s mind:\ncf. his 1990: 55f.; cf. also Moreland 1985: 65), SI\nshould be abandoned because it rules out the (non-empty) possibility\nthat (parts of) reality could be\n non-spatiotemporal.[15]\n Against this, proponents of SI have argued that the thesis that\nreality must be spatiotemporal can be independently justified\n(primarily because naturalism can be independently justified,\ncf. Schaffer 2001: 251). And even if it cannot, SI could\neasily be modified to accommodate the analogue of the\nlocational order of space (Campbell 1997 [1981]: 136; Schaffer\n ibid.).[16]\n\nA common argument in favor of SI is that it allows its\nproponents to rule out what most agree are empty\npossibilities: swapping and piling.\n\nSwapping: According to the so-called \u2018swapping\nargument\u2019 (first formulated in Armstrong 1989: 131\u2013132;\ncf. also Schaffer 2001: 250f; Ehring 2011:\n 78f.),[17], [18]\n if properties are tropes, and individuation is primitive, two\ndistinct yet exactly similar tropes might swap places (this redness\nhere might have been there, and vice versa). The\nresult, post-swap, is a situation that is ontologically distinct from\nthat pre-swap. However, empirically/causally the pre- and post-swap\nsituations are the same (cf. LaBossiere 1993: 262 and Denkel\n1996: 173f. for reasons to doubt that they are the same).\nThat is, given the natural laws as we know them, that this red-trope\nhere swaps places with that red-trope there makes no\ndifference to the future evolution of things. Which means that, not\nonly would the world look, feel and smell exactly the same to us pre-\nand post-swap, it would be in principle impossible to construct a\ndevice able to distinguish the two situations from one another. For\nany device able to detect the (primitive) difference between the two\nsituations would also have to be a device able to communicate this\ndifference (by making a sound, by turning a handle, etc\u2026) yet\nthis is precisely what the fact that swapping makes no difference to\nthe future evolution of things prevents (cf. Dasgupta 2009).\nThis makes admitting the possibility of swapping seem unnecessary. If\nwe also accept the (arguably reasonable) Eleatic principle according\nto which only changes that matter empirically/causally should count as\ngenuine, we can draw the even stronger conclusion that swapping is not\ngenuinely possible, and, hence, that any account of individuation from\nwhich it follows that it is, should be\n abandoned.[19]\n\nTo accept SI does not immediately block swapping (Schaffer 2001: 250).\nFor, SI (just like OI and PI) is a principle about trope individuation\nthat holds intra-worldly. In this case: within any given\nworld, no two exactly similar tropes are at zero distance from each\nother. Swapping, on the other hand, concerns what is possibly true (or\nnot) of exactly similar tropes considered inter-worldly. But\nthis means that, although SI does not declare swapping possible, it\ndoesn\u2019t rule it out either. According to the proponent of SI,\nthis is actually a good thing. For there is one possibility that it\nwould be unfortunate if one\u2019s principle of individuation\ndid block, namely the possibility\u2014called\nsliding\u2014that this red-trope here could have\nbeen there had the wind blown differently (Schaffer 2001:\n251). To get the desired result (i.e., to block swapping while\nallowing for sliding), Schaffer suggests we combine trope theory with\nSI and a Lewisian counterpart theory of transworld identity\n(Lewis 1986). The result is an account according to which exactly\nresembling tropes are intra-worldly identical if they inhabit\nthe same position in space-time. And according to which they are\ninter-worldly counterparts, if they are distinct, yet stand\nin sufficiently similar distance- and other types of relations to\ntheir respective (intra-worldly) neighbors. With this addition in\nplace, Schaffer claims, a trope theory which individuates its posits\nwith reference to their spatiotemporal position will make\nroom for the possibility of sliding, because (2001: 253):\n\n\nOn the counterfactual supposition of a shift in wind, what results is\na redness exactly like the actual one, which is in perfectly\nisomorphic resemblance relations to its worldmates as the actual one\nis to its worldmates, with just a slight difference in distance with\nrespect to, e.g., the roundness of the moon.\n\n\n\u2026yet it won\u2019t allow for the possibility of\nswapping, because:\n\n\n\u2026the nearest relative of the redness of the rose which is\nhere at our world would be the redness still here\n\u2018post-swap\u2019. The redness which would be here has exactly\nthe same inter- and intraworld resemblance relations as the redness\nwhich actually is here, and the same distance relations, and hence is\na better counterpart than the redness which would be\nthere.\n\n\nThis is not necessarily a reason to prefer SI over PI, however. For,\nPI, just like SI, is an inter-worldly principle of individuation,\nwhich means that it, just like SI, could be combined with a Lewisian\ncounterpart theory, thereby preventing swapping yet making room for\nsliding. It is, in other words, the counterpart theory, and not SI (or\nPI), which does all the work. In any case, it is not clear that\nintra-worldly swapping is an empty possibility. According to\nEhring, there are circumstances in which a series of slidings\nconstitute one case of swapping, something that he thinks would make\nswapping more a reason for than against PI (Ehring 2011:\n81\u201385).\n\nPiling: Even if swapping does not give us a reason to prefer\nSI over PI, perhaps its close cousin \u2018piling\u2019 does.\nConsider a particular red rose. Given trope theory, this rose is red\nbecause it is partly constituted by a redness-trope. But what is to\nprevent more than one\u2014even indefinitely\nmany\u2014exactly similar red-tropes from partly constituting this\nrose? Given PI: nothing. It is however far from clear how one could\nempirically detect that the rose has more than one redness trope, just\nlike it is not clear how one could empirically detect how many redness\ntropes it has, provided it has more than one. This is primarily\nbecause it is far from clear how having more than one redness trope\ncould make a causal difference in the world. But if piling makes no\nempirical/causal difference, then given a (plausible) Eleatic\nprinciple, the possibility of piling is empty, which means that PI\nought to be rejected (Armstrong 1978: 86; cf. also Simons\n1994: 558; Schaffer 2001: 254, fn. 11).\n\nIn defense of PI, its proponents now point to a special case of\npiling, called \u2018pyramiding\u2019 (an example being a 5 kg\nobject consisting of five 1 kg tropes). Pyramiding does seem\ngenuinely possible. Yet, if piling is ruled out, so is pyramiding\n(Ehring 2011: 87ff.; cf. also Armstrong 1997: 64f.; Daly\n1997: 155). According to Schaffer, this is fine. For, although\nadmittedly not quite as objectionable as other types of piling (which\nhe calls \u2018stacking\u2019), pyramiding faces a serious problem\nwith predication: if admitted, it will be true of the 5 kg object that\n\u201c[i]t has the property of weighing 1 kg\u201d (Schaffer 2001:\n254). Against this, Ehring has pointed out that to say of the 5 kg\nobject that \u201c[i]t has the property of weighing 1 kg\u201d is at\nmost pragmatically odd, and that, even if this oddness is regarded as\nunacceptable, to avoid it would not require the considerable\ncomplication of one\u2019s theory of predication imagined by Schaffer\n(Ehring 2011: 88\u201391).\n\nAccording to Schaffer, the best argument for the possibility of\npiling\u2014hence the best argument against SI\u2014is rather\nprovided by the existence of so-called bosons (photons being one\nexample). Bosons are entities which do not obey Pauli\u2019s\nExclusion Principle, and hence such that two or more bosons\ncan occupy the same quantum state. A \u2018one-high\u2019\nboson-pile is hence empirically distinguishable from a\n\u2018two-high\u2019 one, which means that the possibility of piling\nin general is not ruled out even if we accept an Eleatic principle.\nSchaffer (2001: 255) suggests we solve this problem for SI by\nconsidering the wave\u2014not the particle/boson\u2014as the way the\nobject \u2018really\u2019 is. But this solution comes with\ncomplications of its own for the proponent of SI. For, \u201c[t]he\nwave function lives in configuration space rather than physical space,\nand the ontology of the wave function, its relation to physical space,\nand its relation to the relativistic conception of spacetime which SI\nso naturally fits remain deeply mysterious\u201d (Schaffer 2001:\n 256).[20]\n",
