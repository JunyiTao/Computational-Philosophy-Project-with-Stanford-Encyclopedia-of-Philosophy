    "main_text": "Conceptions of Distributive Equality: Equality of What? || Utilitarianism\n3.3 Utilitarianism\n\nIt is possible to interpret utilitarianism as concretizing moral\nequality \u2013 and this in a way meant to offer the same\nconsideration to the interests of all human beings (Kymlicka 1990, pp.\n31f., Hare 1981, p. 26, Sen 1992, pp. 13f.). From the utilitarian\nperspective, since everyone counts as one and no one as more than one\n(Bentham), the interests of all should be treated equally without\nconsideration of contents of interest or an individual\u2019s material\nsituation. For utilitarianism, this means that all enlightened\npersonal interests have to be fairly aggregated. The morally proper\naction is the one that maximizes utility (Hare 1984). This conception\nof equal treatment has been criticized as inadequate by many opponents\nof utilitarianism. At least in utilitarianism\u2019s classical form \u2013\nso the critique reads \u2013 the hoped for moral equality is flawed,\nbecause all desires are taken up by the utilitarian calculation,\nincluding \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d preferences\n(Dworkin 1977, p. 234) that are meant to all have equal weight, even\nwhen they diminish the \u2018rights\u2019 and intentions of others.\nThis conflicts with our everyday understanding of equal treatment.\nWhat is here at play is an argument involving \u201coffensive\u201d\nand \u201cexpensive\u201d taste: a person cannot expect others to\nsustain his or her desires at the expense of their own (Kymlicka 1990,\np. 40 f.). Rather, according to generally shared conviction, equal\ntreatment consistently requires a basis of equal rights and resources\nthat cannot be taken away from one person, whatever the desire of\nothers. In line with Rawls (1971, pp. 31, 564, cf. 450), many hold\nthat justice entails according no value to interests insofar as they\nconflict with justice. According to this view, unjustified preferences\nwill not distort the mutual claims people have on each other. Equal\ntreatment has to consist of everyone being able to claim a fair\nportion, and not in all interests having the same weight in disposal\nover my portion. Utilitarians cannot admit any restrictions on\ninterests based on morals or justice. As long as utilitarian theory\nlacks a concept of justice and fair allocation, it must fail in its\ngoal of treating everyone as equals. As Rawls (1971, pp. 27) also\nfamously argues, utilitarianism that involves neglecting the\nseparateness of persons does not contain a proper interpretation of\nmoral equality as equal respect for each individual.\n",
