    "main_text": "The \u201cMan Measure\u201d Thesis || Objections and the practical interpretation\n2.2 Objections and the practical interpretation\n\nMM faces two serious objections: the charge that it is self-refuting\nand the charge of solipsism. The charge of being self-refuting (or\nperitrope, as the ancients called it: literally, the charge\nof turning oneself upside down) was apparently formulated for the\nfirst time by Democritus (80A15 DK) and then further developed by\nPlato (in Theaetetus and Euthydemus) and Aristotle\n(in the fourth book of Metaphysics). In brief, this\naccusation states that if all judgements are true (this being the\nimplicit meaning of MM), then the judgement that MM is false is also\ntrue; hence, MM is false. Protagoras had reportedly further claimed\nthat \u201cit is not possible to contradict\u201d (80A19 DK) and\nthis had led Plato and especially Aristotle (Met. IV 5,\n1009a6\u201316) to add that the sophist denied the principle of\nnon-contradiction, suggesting another version of the\nperitrope charge: Protagoras claims that all judgements are\ntrue (let us call this thesis P) and his opponent that\nProtagoras\u2019 claim is false (non-P); but according to Protagoras\ncontradiction is impossible and therefore non-P is compatible with P;\nbut in this case, non-P is true; hence, P is false (Barnes 1979:\n548).\n\nThe soundness of this criticism has been the object of a heated\nscholarly debate, yet no shared solution has been reached (see now\nCastagnoli 2010). An infallibilist interpretation, according to which\nall beliefs are true simpliciter (see Theaetetus\n161d6-7, 167a7-8; Aristotle, Metaphysics IV 5, 1009a7-8),\nclearly leads to Protagoras\u2019 confutation for the above reasons.\nBut Protagoras could nonetheless defend himself by endorsing some kind\nof relativism, according to which nothing is true\nsimpliciter, but always relative to some framework. As a\nmatter of fact, the criticism omits the qualifiers \u201cfor\nme\u201d and \u201cfor you\u201d, which are crucial to his thesis\n(Theaetetus 161d2-3; Aristotle, Met. IV 6,\n1011a19-20; Sextus Empiricus, M VII 60). By introducing these\nqualifiers, Protagoras could reformulate the peritrope charge\nin such a way as to neutralise it: if what I judge is true and I judge\nthat Protagoras\u2019 thesis is false, it does not follow from this\nthat Protagoras\u2019 thesis is false in an absolute sense, but only\nthat it is false \u201cfor me\u201d. And the fact that it is false\n\u201cfor me\u201d does not prevent it from being true for other\npeople: it remains true, for instance, for Protagoras, who can thus\navoid the charge that he is turning himself upside down (as well as\ndenying the principle of non-contradiction; it may be argued however\nthat this latter principle is denied when Protagoras\u2019 adversary\njudges that Protagoras\u2019 thesis is false: in this case she would\nbe relying on Protagoras\u2019 thesis and at the same time denying\nit).\n\nThis defensive strategy, however, is potentially open to the more\nserious charge of solipsism. This risk is clearly present in the\naforementioned thesis that it is \u201cimpossible to\ncontradict\u201d (80A19 DK). The thesis in question is fully\ncompatible with MM. If each individual is the measure of his or her\nown world of sensations and judgements, contradiction can only be\napparent: each individual entertains a relationship with things whose\ntruth-reality cannot be contradicted or disputed by others. But how\ncan we deal with these divergences and oppositions if everyone is\nright? If this is how things stand, what follows is a radical (and\nintolerable) form or solipsism, whereby the fact that each person is\nhis or her own judge makes it impossible to discuss things with others\n(and, in addition, makes also Protagoras\u2019 teaching useless). The\nprice that Protagoras must pay in order to defend the consistency of\nhis doctrines seems far too high (Woodruff 1999: 303).\n\nIn this case too Protagoras has some arguments on his side. Up until\nthis point, the discussion has centred on the problem of\n\u201ctruth\u201d, a concept the importance of which can hardly be\ndisputed. However, no matter how central it may be, truth is not the\nonly criterion that governs human thoughts and actions. Alongside\ntruth there are other, equally important criteria, as the sophist\nargues in the so-called \u201cProtagoras\u2019 Apology\u201d\n(166a\u2013168c = 80A21a DK; the Theaetetus takes place in 399 BCE,\nthe year of Socrates\u2019 trial, by which time Protagoras had\nalready passed away; this is the answer Protagoras would have given to\nSocrates, had he been present at the dialogue: it is not a fragment\nbut it probably conveys some of his views). In his fictional reply,\nProtagoras distinguishes between knowledge and wisdom\n(sophia). Unlike knowledge and truth, wisdom varies. From the\npoint of view of knowledge and truth, every individual is a measure,\nand the fact that each person is a measure depends on his relationship\nwith reality he or she is experiencing\u2014this is a fact. But from\nthe point of view of the value of the contents (of wisdom), it cannot\nbe ruled out that some people are capable of allowing the individual\nto establish a more expedient relationship with reality. \n\n\nAs for wisdom (sophia) and the wise man (sophos), I\nam very far from saying that they do not exist; but I also call the\nman clever who, by transforming things makes them appear to be good\nand be good for someone to whom they appeared to be bad and were bad.\n(Theaetetus 166d = 80A21a DK) \n\n\nProtagoras\u2019 aim is not merely to abolish the idea of truth which\nis shattered into an endless number of private truths; his aim is to\nreplace this criterion with another, more effective criterion, that of\nthe useful. It is by reflecting on the issue of the useful that the\nsophist, while respecting everybody\u2019s opinion, shows his wisdom.\nThe useful varies from one situation to the next, and the problem is\nto identify what is truly expedient in each case.\n\nAll in all, it is difficult to articulate a comprehensive and\nconsistent interpretation of MM. The testimonies are scarce, and they\nbasically depend on Plato, who, though considering Protagoras a worthy\ninterlocutor, is not so much interested in presenting his thought as\nto criticise it. Whereas in the first part of the dialogue Protagoras\nis presented as endorsing some sort of relativism, in the\n\u201cApology\u201d the emphasis is on some kind of pluralism, which\nis further confirmed by a passage from Protagoras, where it\nis argued that the variety of the useful does not so much depend on\nwhat one subjectively believes to be good or bad as on the fact that\nreality is manifold (Guthrie 1971: 164\u2013175; Apfel 2011). The\nproblem of relativism has stimulated a huge discussion among modern\nscholars (after the seminal Burnyeat 1976); but it has been correctly\nquestioned that the strict adoption of this category can really\ncontribute to a better understanding of the sophist (Bett 1989). A\npluralist interpretation, on the contrary, enables us to underline the\npractical dimension of Protagoras\u2019 teaching which was certainly\nimportant, and explains how MM can be combined with his activity of\nteacher. As already remarked, MM was the opening sentence of an\nepideixis: on the one side, it challenged traditional wisdom\nand epistemic authority by revaluating personal opinions and\nexperiences; on the other side it also argued for the importance of\npractical and concrete expertise. Indeed, it was an excellent\npresentation and advertisement for his activity.\n",
