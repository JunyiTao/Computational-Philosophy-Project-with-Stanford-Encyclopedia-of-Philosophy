For one\nthing, X-practitioners may not have given a particular\nquestion any thought. For another, X-practitioners might all\nbe mistaken. Moreover, X-practitioners might self-consciously\nmaintain the opposite of or at any rate something distinct from\nwhat X-standards sanction. For instance, a scientist may\nbelieve p, perhaps on the basis of a \u2018gut\nfeeling\u2019 or on account of some overriding religious convictions\nor for whatever non-scientific reason, whilst still recognising that\nscientific standards support not-p. Or a mathematician may\nbelieve that the number 7 has mystical properties but not believe\nit qua mathematician. A tighter connection between practitioners and standards, then, might\nbe this: what X-standards sanction is\nwhat X-practitioners are disposed to correctly\nbelieve qua X-practitioners. (This is not intended\nas a reductive analysis.)\n\n\nHaving said that, it takes special pleading to attribute widespread\nerror to the community of X-practitioners regarding\nwhat X-standards sanction. Thus what X-practitioners\nin fact believe usually serves as good, though defeasible, evidence\nfor what X-standards sanction.\n",
