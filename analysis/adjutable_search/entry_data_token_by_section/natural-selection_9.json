    "main_text": "Causation\n5. Causation\n\nGodfrey-Smith makes the point that some character could fit\nLewontin\u2019s conditions for evolution by natural selection by mere\nchance. Parents with a particular trait could have more offspring than\nparents without it, even though the trait does not causally influence\noffspring number (Godfrey-Smith 2007: 511). In such cases, Lewontin\nwould rule there is evolution by natural selection, provided that the\ntrait is heritable, since individuals with it have a de facto\nhigher rate of survival and reproduction, if only by chance. Equally,\na trait could spread by hitchhiking and meet Lewontin\u2019s\nrequirements for selection (or Okasha\u2019s for that matter). A\nhitchhiking trait is correlated with one that causes reproduction, and\nas a result, individuals with the trait exhibit increased\nreproduction, despite the trait not causing reproduction at all. But,\nfor Godfrey-Smith, there is no natural selection, at least in the\nfocused sense, on the trait in these sorts of cases because\ndifferences in the character had no causal role in producing variation\nin offspring number (Godfrey-Smith 2007: 513).\n\nAs noted earlier, theorists working on type recursions who defend the\nview that selection is a distinct quantity from drift typically defend\nthe view that it is also a distinct cause. Forber and Reisman\nexplicitly invoke the interventionist account of causation and argue\nthat natural selection (and drift) qualify as causes (Reisman &\nForber 2005). They do so on the basis of an examination of\nexperimental work in which selection (and drift) are manipulated to\nproduce changes in population-level behavior. \u201cCausalists\u201d\nworking with type recursions must confront the natural philosophical\nchallenge of stating, precisely, what cause or causes count as\nselection, that is, what exactly fitness coefficients quantify. The\nBeatty/Millstein interpretation of selection as discriminate sampling\nis explicitly causal. Equally, Otsuka\u2019s position that fitness\ncoefficients should be interpreted as linear path coefficients from\nphenotype to offspring number in causal graphs is clearly causal as\nwell.\n\nThe Price Equation may be deployed for some system without regard to\nwhat causal relationships hold within it. Okasha argues that variants\nof the equation may constitute causally adequate representations under\nspecial circumstances. It is important to distinguish this contention\nfrom the contention that the Price Equation is causally interpretable.\nThe right-hand side terms of the Price Equation are (algebraic\nfunctions of) statistical functions, while, in causally interpretable\nequations, causes are variables (Woodward 2003: 93). A causally\ninterpretable system of equations is one that one features causal\nvariables on its right-hand side and effects on the left: \\(a = b\\) is\ncausally interpretable if \\(b\\) causes \\(a\\) but not if the\nreverse. Okasha does not call any formulation of the Price Equation\ncausally interpretable. However, the notion of causal adequacy he does\ndeploy seems to have been developed solely in the context\nOkasha\u2019s discussion of the Price Equation and thus risks being\nabout causation in name only.\n\nOkasha\u2019s basic approach is to assess whether some formulation of\nthe Price Equation as a causally adequate representation in terms of\nwhether the statistical functions in the equation take positive values\nwhile their arguments are causally related (2016: 447). In a\nmulti-level, causally adequate version of the Price Equation,\n\n\\[\nW\\Delta P =\\textrm{Cov}(W_{k},P_{k}) + \\mathrm{E}_{k}[\\textrm{Cov}(w_{jk},p_{jk})]\n\\]\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\\(W\\) is average offspring number\n\\(\\Delta P\\) is change in average character value\n\\(W_{k}\\) is the average fitness of the individuals in the\n\\(k\\)th group\n\\(P_{k}\\) is the average character value of the individuals in the\n\\(k\\)th group\n\\(\\mathrm{E}_{k}\\) is the average across groups\n\\(w_{jk}\\) is the offspring number of the \\(j\\)th\nindividual in the \\(k\\)th group\n\\(p_{jk}\\) is the character value of the \\(j\\)th\nindividual in the \\(k\\)th group\n\n\n\nOkasha proposes a test for causal adequacy that works this way: if the\nfirst term takes a positive value, then \\(W_{k}\\) and \\(P_{k}\\) must\nbe causally related, or else the equation is not causally adequate.\nEqually, a version of the Price Equation is not causally adequate if\nits statistical functions take a positive value despite their\ncomponents failing to be causally related, or if its statistical\nfunctions take value zero when their components are causally related.\nWhether a version of the Price Equation is causally adequate is thus a\nfunction of the causal relationships among the variables in the\nsystem. On this approach, the concept of causal adequacy means\nsomething different than causal interpretability does for equations\nthat exhibit dependencies between variables that represent causes.\n",
