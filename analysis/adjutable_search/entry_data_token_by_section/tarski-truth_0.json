    "main_text": "The 1933 programme and the semantic conception\n1. The 1933 programme and the semantic conception\n\nIn the late 1920s Alfred Tarski embarked on a project to give rigorous\ndefinitions for notions useful in scientific methodology. In 1933 he\npublished (in Polish) his analysis of the notion of a true sentence.\nThis long paper undertook two tasks: first to say what should count as\na satisfactory definition of \u2018true sentence\u2019 for a given\nformal language, and second to show that there do exist satisfactory\ndefinitions of \u2018true sentence\u2019 for a range of formal\nlanguages. We begin with the first task; Section 2 will consider the\nsecond.\n\nWe say that a language is fully interpreted if all its\nsentences have meanings that make them either true or false. All the\nlanguages that Tarski considered in the 1933 paper were fully\ninterpreted, with one exception described in Section 2.2 below. This\nwas the main difference between the 1933 definition and the later\nmodel-theoretic definition of 1956, which we shall examine in Section\n3.\n\nTarski described several conditions that a satisfactory definition of\ntruth should meet.\n",
