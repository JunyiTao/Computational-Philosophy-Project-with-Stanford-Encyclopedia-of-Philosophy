    "main_text": "The Conditions of Self-Consciousness || Self-Consciousness and Rationality\n4.2 Self-Consciousness and Rationality\n\nIs self-consciousness a necessary condition of rationality? A number\nof philosophers have argued that rationality requires self-knowledge\nwhich itself implies self-consciousness (see Shoemaker 1988, 1994;\nBurge 1996; Moran 2001; Bilgrami 2006; Boyle 2009, 2011; for a general\ndiscussion of this approach to self-knowledge, see Gertler 2011: ch.\n6). In his case against perceptual theories of self-knowledge,\nShoemaker (1994) argues against the possibility of self-blindness;\nagainst, that it is, the possibility that a rational creature with all\nthe necessary concepts might be simply unaware of its own sensations,\nbeliefs, and so on. A rational creature that is in pain, Shoemaker\nargues, will typically desire to be rid of her pain, and this requires\nthat she believe that she is in pain. As Shoemaker puts it, to see\nrational responses to pain \n\n\nas pain behavior is to see them as motivated by such states\nof the creature as the belief that it is in pain, the desire to be rid\nof the pain, and the belief that such and such a course of behaviour\nwill achieve that result. (Shoemaker 1994: 228) \n\n\nThis belief, that she is in pain, is a self-conscious one; it is a\nbelief that she herself is in pain. This connection between rational\nbehaviour and first-person thought is, of course, the one highlighted\nby Perry\u2019s (1979) case of the messy shopper in his discussion of\nthe essential indexical (see\n \u00a72.1).\n\nThe connection between rationality and self-knowledge (and so\nself-consciousness), Shoemaker argues, is even more pronounced in the\ncase of our awareness of our own beliefs. Rational subjects should\nabide by certain strictures on the contents of their beliefs, updating\nthem in line with new evidence, removing inconsistencies, and so on.\nAnd this, Shoemaker argues, requires that they not be self-blind with\nrespect to their beliefs. It requires that they are self-conscious. As\nShoemaker writes, \n\n\nin an important class of cases the rational revision or adjustment of\nthe belief-desire system requires that we undertake investigations\naimed at determining what revisions or readjustments to make\n[\u2026] What rationalizes the investigation are one\u2019s\nhigher-order beliefs about what one believes and has reason to\nbelieve. (Shoemaker 1994: 240; also see Shoemaker\u2019s discussion\nof Moore\u2019s Paradox in Shoemaker 1988, 1994; for critical\ndiscussion of Shoemaker\u2019s arguments in the context of theories\nof self-knowledge see, for example, Macdonald 1999; Kind 2003; Siewert\n2003; Gertler 2011: ch. 5)\n\n\nThe connection that Shoemaker sees between the requirements of\nrationality, on the one hand, and self-awareness, on the other, is\nalso stressed in so-called \u201crationalist\u201d accounts of\nself-knowledge, most prominently in the work of Burge (1996) and Moran\n(2001; for critical discussion of the rationalist approach as an\naccount of self-knowledge see, for example, Peacocke 1996;\nO\u2019Brien 2003; Reed 2010; Gertler 2011: ch. 6). Burge focuses on\nthe notion of the critical reasoner. He writes, \n\n\n[t]o be capable of critical reasoning, and to be subject to certain\nrational norms necessarily associated with such reasoning, some mental\nacts and states must be knowledgeably reviewable. (Burge\n1996: 97; for a fuller argument for the same conclusion, see Burge\n1998) \n\n\nOn Burge\u2019s account, the critical reasoner must be in a position\nto recognise their reasons as reasons, and that requires \u201cthe\nsecond order ability to think about thought contents or propositions,\nand rational relations among them\u201d (1996: 97). This is for the\nreason that belief involves commitments and such commitments\ninvolve meeting certain standards\u2014providing reasons,\nreevaluating where necessary, and so on.\n\nA similar line of thought can be found in Moran\u2019s account of the\nrole of reflection on one\u2019s own state in practical deliberation\nabout what to do and how to feel (Moran 2001: ch. 2). Here the focus\nis not so much on critical reasoning but rather practical deliberation\nas that which requires self-consciousness. This is an idea that is\nalso central to much of Korsgaard\u2019s work (see, in particular,\nKorsgaard 1996, 2009). A central concern of hers is to distinguish\nbetween the sort of action of which all animals are capable and the\nsort of autonomous agency of which we self-conscious subjects are\ncapable. The difference lies, on her broadly Kantian view, in simply\nhaving one\u2019s most powerful desire result in action, on the one\nhand, and counting that desire as a reason for action, on the other.\nIt is the latter that is constitutive of autonomous, deliberative\naction understood from the perspective of practical reason. As she\nwrites, \n\n\n[w]hen you deliberate it is as if there were something over and above\nall your desires, something which is you, and which\nchooses which desire to act upon. (Korsgaard 1996: 100) \n\n\nSelf-consciousness, on this view, \n\n\nis the source of reason. When we become conscious of the workings of\nan incentive within us, the incentive is experienced not as a force or\na necessity but as a proposal, something we need to make a decision\nabout. (Korsgaard 2009: 119; for discussion of Korsgaard\u2019s\naccount of the relation between self-consciousness and the perspective\nof practical reason, see, for example, Nagel 1996; Fitzpatrick 2005;\nSoteriou 2013: ch. 12).\n\n\nSelf-awareness, on these views, is a necessary condition of\nrationality (conceived as the capacity for critical reasoning or\npractical deliberation). Burge also makes it clear that he regards the\ncapacity for critical reasoning to be a necessary condition of\n(conceptual) self-consciousness, since to master and self-ascribe\npsychological concepts such as belief, once must be able to recognise\ntheir role in reasoning, and so employ them (Burge 1996: 97, n.3). As\nhe puts it, \n\n\n[a]cknowledging, with the I concept, that an attitude or act\nis one\u2019s own is acknowledging that rational evaluations of it\nwhich one also acknowledges provide immediate [\u2026] reason and\nrationally immediate motivation to shape the attitude or act in\naccordance with the evaluation [\u2026] The first-person concept\nfixes the locus of responsibility. (Burge 1998: 253)\n\n\nThe claim that there is a constitutive connection between\nself-consciousness and rationality has been met with scepticism by\nKornblith (2011, 2012: ch. 2; for a related line of thought, see Doris\n2015: ch. 2). Regarding the sort of responsiveness to reason involved\nin updating one\u2019s beliefs in accordance with new\nevidence\u2014one of the capacities emphasised by both Shoemaker and\nBurge\u2014Kornblith argues that \u201c[w]hile such responsiveness\nmay be achieved, at times, by way of reflection on one\u2019s beliefs\nand desires, it does not require any such reflection\u201d (2012:\n49). Rationally revising beliefs in the face of evidence, Kornblith is\nkeen to point out, is a capacity enjoyed by non-reflective animals. He\nfurther presents the rationalist view with a challenge: if one thinks\nthat (first-order) beliefs are not themselves responsive to reason,\nhow does adding (second-order) beliefs help? One response to this\nchallenge is to point out that the connection between self-awareness\nand rationality that Shoemaker finds is intended to hold only for\n\u201can important class of cases\u201d (Shoemaker 1994: 240), that\nis it holds for those cases of belief revision that themselves qualify\nas exercises in rational investigation. On this view, whilst\nnon-reflective creatures may have some degree of rationality, their\nlack of self-consciousness means that they are not, as we are, capable\nof fully rational deliberation (for discussion of Kornblith\u2019s\nscepticism concerning the role of self-consciousness in rationality,\nsee Pust 2014; M. Williams 2015; Smithies 2016).\n",
