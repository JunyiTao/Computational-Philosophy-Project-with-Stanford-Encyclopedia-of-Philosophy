    "main_text": "\n\nDescriptive decision theory is concerned with characterising and\nexplaining regularities in the choices that people are disposed to\nmake. It is standardly distinguished from a parallel enterprise,\nnormative decision theory, which seeks to provide an account of the\nchoices that people ought to be disposed to make. Much of the\nwork in this area has been devoted to the building and testing of\nformal models that aim to improve on the descriptive adequacy of a\nframework known as \u201cSubjective Expected Utility\u201d (SEU).\nThis adequacy was first called into question in the middle of the last\ncentury and further challenged by a slew of experimental work in\npsychology and economics from the mid 1960s onwards.\n\nThis entry first sketches out the basic commitments of SEU, before\nmoving on to some of its best-known empirical shortcomings and a small\nselection of those models that have been proposed to supersede it. The\nrelation between descriptive decision theory and its normative\ncounterpart is then discussed, drawing some connections with a number\nof related topics in the philosophical\n literature.[1]\n\n",
