    "main_text": "\n\nJonathan Edwards (1703\u20131758) is widely acknowledged to be\nAmerica's most important and original philosophical theologian. His\nwork as a whole is an expression of two themes \u2014 the absolute\nsovereignty of God and the beauty of God's holiness. The first is\narticulated in Edwards' defense of theological determinism, in a\ndoctrine of occasionalism, and in his insistence that physical objects\nare only collections of sensible \u201cideas\u201d while finite\nminds are mere assemblages of \u201cthoughts\u201d or\n\u201cperceptions.\u201d As the only real cause or substance\nunderlying physical and mental phenomena, God is \u201cbeing in\ngeneral,\u201d the \u201csum of all being.\u201d\n\nEdwards' second theme is articulated in accounts of God's end in\ncreation, and of the nature of true virtue and true beauty. God\ncreates in order to manifest a holiness which consists in a\nbenevolence which alone is truly beautiful. Genuine human virtue is an\nimitation of divine benevolence and all finite beauty is an image of\ndivine loveliness. True virtue is needed to discern this beauty,\nhowever, and to reason rightly about \u201cdivine things.\u201d\n\nEdwards' projected History of Redemption would have drawn\nthese themes together, for it is in his redemptive work in history\nthat God's sovereignty, holiness, and beauty are most clearly\nexhibited.\n",
