    "main_text": "Conscience as self-knowledge and self-assessment\n2. Conscience as self-knowledge and self-assessment\n\nWhen we talk about conscience, we often refer to reflection about\nourselves as moral persons and about our moral conduct. Through\nconscience we examine ourselves, as if we were our own inner judge.\nThe image of an individual split into two persons, one who acts and\nthe other who observes the former\u2019s conduct, reflects the\noriginal conception of \u201cconscience\u201d in the Greek world, at\nleast from the 5th century BCE (Sorabji 2014: 12). But such\nself- knowledge may also be thought of as shared with others\ninside of us, such as God(s) or other imaginary witnesses (for\nexample an admired philosopher according to Epicurus (Sorabji 2014:\n24), or an impartial spectator according to Adam Smith (1759)). The\ngod(s) in question might be the god(s) of a particular religion, such\nas the God of Christianity, or a postulate of the practical reason,\nsuch as in Kant, according to whom reason, in order to be\n\u201cpractical\u201d in the sense of informing moral conduct, needs\nthe idea of a higher authority who sanctions individuals for their\nactions (Kant 1797).\n\nThe role of conscience in this sense is not that of merely gaining\nknowledge about our behavior or character. The knowledge in question\nis typically (though, as explained below, not always) the ground for a\nmoral assessment by conscience. When observing one\u2019s behavior,\nconscience is more like a judge (or sometimes it is identified with\nthe judgment itself) than like a disinterested observer. Thus, for\ninstance, the impartial spectator with which Adam Smith identified\nconscience, inspired by the Stoic\u2019s notion of conscience as an\nimagined admired philosopher judging one\u2019s conduct, is not a\nmorally and emotionally neutral observer, but generates a sentiment of\napproval or disapproval of oneself (Smith 1759 and discussion in\nRaphael 2007: 34). Even in the Catholic view, where the main\ncharacterization of conscience is that of a witness of God\u2019s law\nin our hearts (as described in\n section 3),\n conscience is also presented as \u201ca moral judgment about man and\nhis actions, a judgment either of acquittal or condemnation\u201d\n(John Paul II 1993: 59). Analogously, in the Kantian view, conscience\nis conceived of as an inner court (Wood 2008: 184): it is moral\nself-awareness that allows to apply the moral law suggested by\npractical reason to our moral conduct, and to judge whether we have\ncomplied with the moral law. As Kant defines it in the Metaphysics\nof Morals, conscience is \n\n\npractical reason holding the human being\u2019s duty before him for\nhis acquittal or condemnation in every case that comes under a law\n(Kant 1797 [1991]: 160) \n\n\nand \n\n\nconsciousness of an internal court in man. (Kant 1797 [1991]: 189)\n\n\nThis understanding of conscience as an inner court is well illustrated\nby the story of Huckleberry Finn in Mark Twain\u2019s famous novel\n(Twain 1884; Bennett 1974). In a well-known episode of the novel, Huck\nfeels guilty and blameworthy for having helped his slave friend Jim to\nescape from his owner Miss Watson. Blame does not come from some\nexternal moral authority, but it is a verdict issued by conscience\naccording to its moral laws. The bites of conscience in Huck\u2019s\ncase were caused by a tension between his feelings supporting what he\ndid and the principles he had inherited from his social environment.\nAt the time when the novel is set, slave-owning was considered a\nnatural type of possession and helping slaves run away meant depriving\nsomeone of her private property. This was the \u201claw\u201d\n(metaphorically speaking) against which Huck\u2019s conscience\nassessed his behavior.\n\nThis story illustrates another interesting feature of conscience as a\nfaculty for self-assessment, i.e., the asymmetry between our\nconfidence in the validity of the moral standards provided by our own\nconscience and our confidence in the validity of the standards\nprovided other people\u2019s conscience. Huck thinks that what he did\nwas wrong and that it rendered him blameworthy in spite of\nhis feelings, because he thinks that his own conscience provides a\ncorrect moral standard, i.e., a standard that he endorses even if some\nof his feelings or beliefs indicate otherwise. This seems to reflect\nour common way of relating to our own conscience: we try to adjust our\nfeelings and judgments to our conscience\u2019s standard, rather than\nvice versa. However, the same does not hold when we talk of\nother people\u2019s conscience, which is usually taken to indicate\ntheir subjective moral standard and does not imply that we are\nendorsing it. This asymmetry suggests that there is no conceptual\nrelation between the notion of conscience per se and the\nnotion of an objective or correct moral standard; rather, it stresses\nonce more the fact that conscience has merely to do with one\u2019s\nprivate morality and one\u2019s commitment to her own morality.\n\nConsistently with this understanding of conscience as self-knowledge\nand self-assessment, it has been suggested by some that\npsychopaths\u2014i.e., pathological subjects who display antisocial\nbehavior and systematically act without regard to what they consider\nto be right or wrong\u2014can be said to lack conscience (Hare 1999).\nFor instance, according to Vujo\u0161evi\u0107 (2015), in\npsychopaths the link between moral knowledge or beliefs and\nself-directed feelings of condemnation (e.g., guilt) is broken:\npsychopaths cannot feel the remorse that normal functioning agents\nfeel when they perceive the discrepancy between their moral beliefs\nand their behavior, and as a consequence psychopaths do not consider\nthemselves accountable for their actions (Gudjonsson and Roberts 1983;\nAharoni et al. 2012), although their moral beliefs are often\n\u201cnormal\u201d (Schaich and Sinnott-Armstrong 2013)\n\nAs mentioned above in this section, when expressing itself through\nself-evaluative feelings, conscience might be conceived of as either\nconstituted by such feelings (Fuss 1964) or as\noccasioning them (Broad 1940).\n\nIn the former sense (conscience as constituted by\nself-evaluative feelings), the feeling is an essential part of\nconscience. Conscience in this case is better conceived not as a judge\nwho issues sentences, but as a feeling with cognitive\ncontent\u2014where the cognitive content concerns the adherence of\none\u2019s behavior to a certain moral standard; in such cases, the\nnegative feeling informs me that what I am doing or am contemplating\ndoing is wrong (according to my own moral parameters). In the latter\nsense (conscience as occasioning self-evaluative feelings),\nthe inner judge, when in tension with one\u2019s conduct, generates\nnegative self-directed feelings (Mill 1861: ch 3). For instance, in\nFreud the \u201cSuper-Ego\u201d\u2014the part of our personality\nthat attends to prohibitions, inhibitions and moral\nconstraints\u2014takes \u201cthe form of conscience\u201d to\nexercise its control over one\u2019s impulses and instincts by\nproducing negative evaluative feelings towards the individual, such as\naggressiveness towards the Ego and guilt (Freud 1929 [2000]: 30). As\nwe shall see below in\n section 4,\n these self-directed negative feelings play an essential role in\nfulfilling the motivational function of conscience.\n\nAs the characterization of conscience as self-assessment here\npresented suggests, conscience has most often been associated with\nnegative feelings (Arendt 1971), such as shame, guilt, fear,\ncontrition. While these feelings are typical of the Christian\nunderstanding of conscience, they need not be tied to a religious\nview: for most of us, even in our common language, conscience is\nsomething that yields negative feelings more often than not\u2014for\nexample we often talk of the \u201cbites of conscience\u201d or of\nconscience as causing us \u201cremorse\u201d (which derives from the\nLatin \u201cremordere\u201d, i.e., \u201cto bite\nagain\u201d). However, a joyful conscience that praises and takes\npride of one\u2019s own moral merit can be conceived as well.\nExamples of joyful conscience can be found for instance in Cicero and\nsome Latin Stoics, most prominently Seneca (Sorabji 2014:\n25\u201330). Also in the Protestant tradition started by Luther we\nfind the idea of a joyful conscience, where joy springs not from pride\nor self-praise, but from awareness of God\u2019s future remission of\nsins (Luther 1535; Calvin 1536).\n\nThe contrast between the Protestant joyful conscience and the Catholic\nconscience burdened by negative feelings of guilt and fear was\nemphasized by Luther when he denounced the \u201cterrorization of\nconscience\u201d by the Roman Catholic Church. According to Luther,\nwith this terrorization the Roman Catholic Church aimed to reinforce\nits authority and control over people\u2019 conscience. In fact,\nconscience in the Catholic tradition can only be relieved from its\nburden of negative feelings through the confession of one\u2019s sins\nto a priest and the penitence decided by that priest.\n",
