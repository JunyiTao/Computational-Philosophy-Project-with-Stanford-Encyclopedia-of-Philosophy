In\nthe Letters Macaulay sets out her rather sensible\nprescriptions for raising robust children, who are neither rendered\ntoo timid nor too bold, and she argues that given the differences in\nindividual character, educators may have to take different approaches\ndepending on the temperament of the child. She suggests that, although\nshe has dreamed of schemes of public education, she has come to the\nconclusion that the government of her time could not be trusted to\nprovide appropriate care, and so she advises a private education in\nwhich boys and girls are educated together and taught exactly the same\ncurriculum, with some concessions to sexual difference in the choice\nof exercise and sports.\n\nThe educational advice that Macaulay offers is remarkably practical.\nShe recommends that those who can afford it should have their children\ntaught dancing from a young age, as a means of acquiring grace, but\nshe also observes that in order for the lessons to be effective they\nshould be a pastime, not a task. Similarly, if children are given the\nimpression that being allowed to read is a privilege and\nentertainment, they will be happy to acquire the skill. While dancing\nand music are excellent sources of amusement, they should not take up\ntoo much time, and there are other amusements that Macaulay considers\nbeneficial, such as needlework for girls and handicrafts for boys. She\ndisapproves of punishments and practices that are intended to\nterrorize children, such as \u201cshutting up in dark closets\u201d,\nor being told tales of ghosts and ghouls who are coming to get them.\nChildren should be encouraged to be as independent as possible, since\nself-sufficiency is a great source of confidence and peace of mind.\nHer prescriptions for the early education of children concentrate on\nmaking them physically and emotionally robust, and on avoiding both\nthe extremes of timidity and cruel insensitivity. Up to the age of\ntwelve formal learning should be made pleasant and involve writing,\narithmetic, Latin grammar, geography, French learnt by the simple\nmethod of hiring some French domestic servants, and as much physics as\ncan be easily understood by children.\n\nAs children mature, Macaulay recommends a more formidable curriculum.\nAmong her recommended reading there is Plutarch\u2019s Lives,\nRollin\u2019s Ancient History in French, and Livy, works which\nwere surely early influences on her own thought. She puts off learning\nGreek until fifteen, and moral philosophy in the form of works by\nCicero, Plutarch, Seneca and Epictetus until sixteen, but expects her\npupils, by the age of eighteen to be reading Plato, Demosthenes,\nSophocles, Euripides and Homer in Greek, as well as Caesar and Cicero\nin Latin. Among modern philosophical texts she recommends two by James\nHarris, his Philosophical Arrangements and Hermes an\ninquiry into universal grammar, Lord Monboddo on language and\nEpea pteroenta by John Horne Tooke, her and her brother\u2019s\nfriend. Political philosophy in the form of the works of James\nHarrington, Algernon Sidney, Locke, and Hobbes is left until the age of\nnineteen. There are two striking omissions from her curriculum; novels\nand the Scripture. The second she leaves until the student has reached\nthe age of twenty-one and after she or he has been introduced to\nmetaphysics through reading Ralph Cudworth, Plato and more Monboddo.\nShe argues that early reading of the Scripture is likely to lead to\nscepticism, and it is only after one has appreciated the morality of\nthe ancients that one can truly understand the moral advances of\nChristianity. To cap off this education she particularly recommends\nThe Light of Nature Pursued by Abraham Tucker.\n\nMacaulay does not approve of the popularity of novels, because of\ntheir concentration on the passion of love, and her suspicion that by\nreading them, young people, who are susceptible to this passion in any\ncase, will be encouraged to pursue it too early. Few novelists, she\nthinks, really accurately portray human sentiments, and she is\nparticularly critical of Samuel Richardson. But she by no means\nintends to deny the reading of novels for entertainment. Her position\nis simply that they do not in general provide a solid moral\nfoundation.\n\nThe whole of this educational program is grounded on her understanding\nof the foundations of morality and moral psychology. Education can\nteach the moral truths, but it also has to take account of unhelpful\nassociations, and those emotional characteristics which result in\nweakness of will, in order to form individuals who can act in\naccordance with the dictates of reason. Macaulay also comments on the\nneed for public education and the abolition of spectacles such as\npublic executions and animal slaughter, which brutalize and corrupt\npeople\u2019s emotional responses.\n",
