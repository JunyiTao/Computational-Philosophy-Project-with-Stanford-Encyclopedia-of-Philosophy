    "main_text": "Content-Based Theories of Inner Speech || The Semantic Content View\n3.2 The Semantic Content View\n\nIn contrast to the phonological content view, the semantic content\nview holds that inner speech episodes always and only have semantic\ncontents. By \u201csemantic contents\u201d, we mean the kinds of\ncontents had by ordinary words, phrases, and sentences of a natural\nlanguage. Such contents are typically equated with the\nmeaning of a word, phrase, or sentence.\n\nOne version of a semantic content view, defended by Christopher Gauker\n(2011, 2018), holds that inner speech episodes exclusively have\nsemantic contents and entirely lack both auditory contents and\nauditory phenomenology. Gauker allows that episodes of auditory verbal\nimagery often accompany inner speech. However, on his view, this\nauditory imagery is not to be identified with inner speech itself.\nRather, according to Gauker, inner speech is a non-sensory linguistic\nphenomenon occurring in the brain that is (often) represented\nby episodes of auditory verbal imagery. Just as we may use\nauditory representations to represent someone else\u2019s speech that\nwe are actually hearing, so too, for Gauker, our inner speech is often\nrepresented by verbal imagery\u2014imagery that is in fact distinct\nfrom the (inner) speech itself. (Here Gauker develops related remarks\nof Wilfrid Sellars (1956).) Notably, Gauker (2018) grants that, in the\ncase of inner speech, this auditory-verbal imagery\nmisrepresents our inner speech as having sonic features\n(i.e., as instantiating phones or phonemes), given that the neural\nevents that constitute inner speech episodes are themselves\nsilent.\n\nGauker\u2019s style of pure semantic content view is not widely\nendorsed. This may be because it clashes with the widespread view that\ninner speech has a sensory character similar to that of hearing\nspeech. On the other hand, Gauker\u2019s view can be said to have an\nadvantage in providing a literal sense in which, when we engage in\ninner speech, we are thinking in words of a natural language\nand not merely about them. On Gauker\u2019s (2011) view, the\nneural events that carry semantic content are themselves tokens of\nwords and phrases of a natural language, and the question of how\nauditory-verbal images can also be linguistic tokens does not arise.\nHis view is also motivated by an opposition to what he calls the\n\u201cLockean\u201d view that sees conceptual thought as something\nprior to and separate from the speech that expresses it. One can see\nGauker (2011) as trying to preserve the idea that abstract\n(conceptual) thought occurs in a language (and is often\nnon-conscious), while divorcing it from the thesis that there exists\nan innate, Fodorian \u201clanguage of thought\u201d (and one that\nmust be exploited in order to learn a natural language).\n\nBerm\u00fadez (2018) offers a different style of semantic content\nview that allows for inner speech to retain a characteristic auditory\nphenomenology. According to Berm\u00fadez, the auditory sensory\ncharacter of inner speech is a result of inner speech episodes having\nnon-representational auditory properties. For\nBerm\u00fadez, the only representational contents had by inner\nspeech episodes are those pertaining to the meanings of words. In\nresponse to the those who argue that inner speech episodes must also\nhave phonological contents (e.g., to explain why we can use inner\nspeech to judge whether two words rhyme), he argues that there is no\nentailment from the fact that inner speech episodes can be useful in\njudging rhyme relations to the conclusion that they represent phonemes\n(2018: 216\u20137).\n\nA third type of theory on which inner speech exclusively has semantic\ncontent proceeds by arguing that inner speech is a genuine form of\nspeech. This argument is typically made on either phenomenological or\nfunctional grounds. From there it is inferred that inner speech must\nhave the same kind of contents as external speech. If episodes of\nexternal speech\u2014i.e., the words we hear when someone\nspeaks\u2014have semantic content but no phonological content\n(because they do not represent phonemes), so too must\nepisodes of inner speech. This approach to theorizing about inner\nspeech is discussed in more detail in\n Section 1.\n Assuming that (unlike Gauker) proponents of such a view wish to\nmaintain that inner speech episodes constitutively have auditory\nsensory character, they may concur with Berm\u00fadez in his claim\nthat the auditory phenomenology of inner speech does not entail the\nrepresentation of auditory properties; or, alternatively, they may\nprovide some other account of why, in many instances, inner speech\nseems to represent phonemes even if it does not really do so.\n",
