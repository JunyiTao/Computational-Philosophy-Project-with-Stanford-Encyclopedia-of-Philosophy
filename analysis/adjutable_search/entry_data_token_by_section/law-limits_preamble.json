    "main_text": "\n\nA central\u2014perhaps the central\u2014question of the\nphilosophy of law concerns the relationship between law and morality.\nThe concern breaks down into many issues, both conceptual and\nevaluative. Among the evaluative issues is the question of obedience\nto law: does the fact that some norm is a legal norm provide any\nreason to obey it? (Green 2004 [2012]; Delmas & Brownlee 2021). By\ncontrast, conceptual or analytical issues include the identification\nof conditions necessary for the existence of a legal system,\nirrespective of the system\u2019s goodness or otherwise. Must some\nreference to morality enter into an adequate definition of law or\nlegal system? (Hart 1963 [1982]; Dickson 2012). And so on.\n\nThe present topic, the question of the limits of law, is\nwidely understood to be one of the important evaluative\nquestions, revolving around the legal enforcement of\nmorality. In the nineteenth century John Stuart Mill proposed\n\u201cthe harm principle\u201d as his answer; in the late twentieth\ncentury H.L.A Hart adopted a significantly modified version of\nMill\u2019s principle and further important versions of the harm\nprinciple followed in the hands of Joel Feinberg and Joseph Raz\n(Sections 4\u20136 below). The harm principle in all its\nmanifestations has encountered strong resistance, most notably from\n\u201clegal moralists\u201d (Sections 1\u20133) and remains in the\neyes of many the focus of debate, the view to adopt, supplement or\nmodify (as some would say), or to beat and replace (as others would\nsay).\n\nA more recent strand to the question of the legal enforcement of\nmorality is Rawlsian in origin, most notably the claim that\nconstitutional essentials and matters of basic justice should be\nsubject to a constraint of public reason (Section 7). An\nalternative perspective challenges the assumption that the limits of\nlaw is simply an evaluative question focussed on law as a\nneutral instrument put to good ends and bad. It takes the limits of\nlaw as in part a conceptual question. Law of its nature has\nan internal morality of its own, so it is claimed, with its own\nbuilt-in limits (Section 8). A further question relates to the\ndeployment by the law of techniques beyond coercion (Section 8).\n",
