    "main_text": "A More Detailed General Description || Two Negative Constitutive Non-cognitivist Claims\n1.1 Two Negative Constitutive Non-cognitivist Claims\n\nTwo negative theses comprise the central common non-cognitivist\nclaims, although current theories often endorse them only in qualified\nform. One thesis might be called semantic nonfactualism.\nSimply put this thesis denies that predicative moral sentences express\npropositions or have substantial truth conditions. Thus semantic\nnonfactualism suggests that their contents are not apt for robust\ntruth or falsity. (The terms \u2018substantial\u2019 and\n\u2018robust\u2019 are inserted here to make room for minimalist\ntheories which offer deflationary accounts of truth, truth-aptness and\npropositions. Such theories will be discussed in more detail in\nsection 4.1 below.) Moral predicates do not denote or express\nproperties and predicative moral sentences do not therefore predicate\nproperties of their subjects. The second negative thesis can be called\npsychological non-cognitivism. This thesis denies that the\nstates of mind conventionally expressed by moral utterances are\nbeliefs or mental states which fall on the cognitive side of the\ncognitive/non-cognitive divide. Typically non-cognitivists accept both\nnegative theses, though there are views which accept one and not the\nother.\n\nSome non-cognitivists have accepted these theses in their strongest\nform \u2013 moral sentences in no way predicate properties, are apt\nfor truth or falsity, or express beliefs. But most current\nnon-cognitivists accept these negative claims only in a somewhat\nweakened form. For example many non-cognitivists hold that moral\njudgments\u2019 primary function is not to express beliefs,\nthough they may express them in a secondary way. Others deny\nthat their contents are true or false in any robust sense but\nnot that they can be true or false in a deflationary sense\naccording to which there is no substantial property separating true\nand false sentences.\n\nNon-cognitivists deny neither that moral sentences are meaningful nor\nthat they are generally used by speakers in meaningful ways. Thus\ndifferent sorts of non-cognitivist couple their negative theses with\nvarious positive claims about the meanings of moral sentences and\nabout the states of mind that they express. It is the diversity of\npositive proposals that generates the different varieties of\nnon-cognitivism. Emotivists suggest that moral sentences express or\nevoke non-cognitive attitudes towards various objects without\nasserting that the speaker has those attitudes. Norm-expressivists\nsuggest (roughly) that the states of mind expressed by moral sentences\nare attitudes of acceptance of various norms or rules governing\nconduct and emotion, perhaps coupled with a judgment that the objects\nor action under discussion comports with those norms. Prescriptivists\nsuggest that these sentences are a species of prescription or command,\nand may or may not offer an account of the state of mind such\njudgments express.\n\nWhile non-cognitivism was first developed as a theory about moral\njudgments (Ogden & Richards 1923, 125. Barnes 1933) many of the\narguments for the position apply equally well to other sorts of\nevaluative language. Thus most non-cognitivists today extend the\ntreatment to normative or evaluative judgments generally, and the\ndiscussion below will often speak of normative or evaluative judgments\nand terms \u2013 a category which includes as paradigms moral\njudgments, judgments of rationality, and judgments of value.\n",
