    "preamble": "\n\nAlbert Camus (1913\u20131960) was a journalist, editor and\neditorialist, playwright and director, novelist and author of short\nstories, political essayist and activist\u2014and, although he more\nthan once denied it, a philosopher. He ignored or opposed systematic\nphilosophy, had little faith in rationalism, asserted rather than\nargued many of his main ideas, presented others in metaphors, was\npreoccupied with immediate and personal experience, and brooded over\nsuch questions as the meaning of life in the face of death. Although\nhe forcefully separated himself from existentialism, Camus posed one\nof the twentieth century\u2019s best-known existentialist questions,\nwhich launches The Myth of Sisyphus: \u201cThere is only one\nreally serious philosophical question, and that is suicide\u201d\n(MS, 3). And his philosophy of the absurd has left us with a\nstriking image of the human fate: Sisyphus endlessly pushing his rock\nup the mountain only to see it roll back down each time he gains the\ntop. Camus\u2019s philosophy found political expression in The\nRebel, which along with his newspaper editorials, political\nessays, plays, and fiction earned him a reputation as a great\nmoralist. It also embroiled him in conflict with his friend, Jean-Paul\nSartre, provoking the major political-intellectual divide of the\nCold-War era as Camus and Sartre became, respectively, the leading\nintellectual voices of the anti-Communist and pro-Communist left.\nFurthermore, in posing and answering urgent philosophical questions of\nthe day, Camus articulated a critique of religion and of the\nEnlightenment and all its projects, including Marxism. In 1957 he won\nthe Nobel Prize for literature. He died in a car accident in January,\n1960, at the age of 46.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Paradoxes of Camus\u2019s Absurdist Philosophy\n\nThere are various paradoxical elements in Camus\u2019s approach to\nphilosophy. In his book-length essay, The Myth of Sisyphus,\nCamus presents a philosophy that contests philosophy itself. This\nessay belongs squarely in the philosophical tradition of\nexistentialism but Camus denied being an existentialist. Both The\nMyth of Sisyphus and his other philosophical work, The\nRebel, are systematically skeptical of conclusions about the\nmeaning of life, yet both works assert objectively valid answers to\nkey questions about how to live. Though Camus seemed modest when\ndescribing his intellectual ambitions, he was confident enough as a\nphilosopher to articulate not only his own philosophy but also a\ncritique of religion and a fundamental critique of modernity. While\nrejecting the very idea of a philosophical system, Camus constructed\nhis own original edifice of ideas around the key terms of absurdity\nand rebellion, aiming to resolve the life-or-death issues that\nmotivated him.\n\nThe essential paradox arising in Camus\u2019s philosophy concerns his\ncentral notion of absurdity. Accepting the Aristotelian idea that\nphilosophy begins in wonder, Camus argues that human beings cannot\nescape asking the question, \u201cWhat is the meaning of\nexistence?\u201d Camus, however, denies that there is an answer to\nthis question, and rejects every scientific, teleological,\nmetaphysical, or human-created end that would provide an adequate\nanswer. Thus, while accepting that human beings inevitably seek to\nunderstand life\u2019s purpose, Camus takes the skeptical position\nthat the natural world, the universe, and the human enterprise remains\nsilent about any such purpose. Since existence itself has no meaning,\nwe must learn to bear an irresolvable emptiness. This paradoxical\nsituation, then, between our impulse to ask ultimate questions and the\nimpossibility of achieving any adequate answer, is what Camus calls\nthe absurd. Camus\u2019s philosophy of the absurd explores\nthe consequences arising from this basic paradox.\n\nCamus\u2019s understanding of absurdity is best captured in an image,\nnot an argument: of Sisyphus straining to push his rock up the\nmountain, watching it roll down, then descending after the rock to\nbegin all over, in an endless cycle. Like Sisyphus, humans cannot help\nbut continue to ask after the meaning of life, only to see our answers\ntumble back down. If we accept this thesis about life\u2019s\nessential absurdity, and Camus\u2019s anti-philosophical approach to\nphilosophical questions, we cannot help but ask: What role is left for\nrational analysis and argument? Doesn\u2019t Camus the philosopher\npreside over the death of philosophy in answering the question whether\nto commit suicide by abandoning the terrain of argument and analysis\nand turning to metaphor to answer it? If life has no fundamental\npurpose or meaning that reason can articulate, we cannot help asking\nabout why we continue to live and to reason. Might not Silenus be\nright in declaring that it would have been better not to have been\nborn, or to die as soon as\n possible?[1]\n And, as Francis Jeanson wrote long before his famous criticism of\nThe Rebel that precipitated the rupture between Camus and\nSartre, isn\u2019t absurdist philosophy a contradiction in terms,\nstrictly speaking no philosophy at all but an anti-rational posture\nthat ends in silence (Jeanson 1947)?\n\nWas Camus actually a philosopher? He himself said no, in a famous\ninterview with Jeanine Delpech in Les Nouvelles\nLitt\u00e9raires in November of 1945, insisting that he did\n\u201cnot believe sufficiently in reason to believe in a\nsystem\u201d (Camus 1965, 1427). This was not merely a public\nposture, since we find the same thought in his notebooks of this\nperiod: he describes himself as an artist and not a philosopher\nbecause \u201cI think according to words and not according to\nideas\u201d (Camus 1995, 113). Still, Jean-Paul Sartre saw\nimmediately that Camus was undertaking important philosophical work,\nand in his review of The Stranger in relation to\nSisyphus, had no trouble connecting Camus with Pascal,\nRousseau, and Nietzsche (Sartre 1962). After they became friends\nSartre spoke publicly of his friend\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of the\nabsurd,\u201d which he distinguished from his own thought for which\nhe accepted the \u201cexistentialist\u201d label that Camus\nrejected. In the years since, the apparent unsystematic, indeed,\nanti-systematic, character of his philosophy, has meant that\nrelatively few scholars have appreciated its full depth and\ncomplexity. They have more often praised his towering literary\nachievements and standing as a political moralist while pointing out\nhis dubious claims and problematic arguments (see Sherman 2008). A\nsignificant recent exception to this is Ronald Srigley\u2019s\nAlbert Camus\u2019 Critique of Modernity (Srigley 2011).\n\nThis entry will negotiate Camus\u2019s deliberate ambivalence as a\nphilosopher while discussing his philosophy. It is not just a matter\nof giving a philosophical reading of this playwright, journalist,\nessayist, and novelist but of taking his philosophical writings\nseriously\u2014exploring their premises, their evolution, their\nstructure, and their coherence. To do so is to see that his writing\ncontains more than a mood and more than images and sweeping,\nunsupported assertions, although it contains many of both. Camus takes\nhis skepticism as far as possible as a form of methodical\ndoubt\u2014that is, he begins from a presumption of\nskepticism\u2014until he finds the basis for a non-skeptical\nconclusion. And he builds a unique philosophical construction, whose\npremises are often left unstated and which is not always argued\nclearly, but which develops in distinct stages over the course of his\nbrief lifetime. Camus\u2019s philosophy can be thus read as a\nsustained effort to demonstrate and not just assert what is entailed\nby the absurdity of human existence. In the process Camus answers the\nquestions posed by The Myth of Sisyphus, \u201cWhy should I\nnot kill myself?\u201d, and by The Rebel, \u201cWhy should\nI not kill others?\u201d\n2. Nuptials and Camus\u2019s Starting Point\n\nCamus\u2019s graduate thesis at the University of Algiers\nsympathetically explored the relationship between Greek philosophy and\nChristianity, specifically the relationship of Plotinus to Augustine\n(Camus 1992). Nevertheless, his philosophy explicitly rejects religion\nas one of its foundations. Not always taking an openly hostile posture\ntowards religious belief\u2014though he certainly does in the novels\nThe Stranger and The Plague\u2014Camus centers his\nwork on choosing to live without God. Another way to understand\nCamus\u2019s philosophy is that it is an effort to explore the issues\nand pitfalls of a post-religious world.\n\nCamus\u2019s earliest published writing containing philosophical\nthinking, Nuptials, appeared in Algeria in 1938, and remain\nthe basis of his later work. These lyrical essays and sketches\ndescribe a consciousness reveling in the world, a body delighting in\nnature, and the individual\u2019s immersion in sheer physicality. Yet\nthese experiences are presented as the solution to a philosophical\nproblem, namely finding the meaning of life in the face of death. They\nappear alongside, and reveal themselves to be rooted in, his first\nextended meditation on ultimate questions.\n\nIn these essays, Camus sets two attitudes in opposition. The first is\nwhat he regards as religion-based fears. He cites religious warnings\nabout pride, concern for one\u2019s immortal soul, hope for an\nafterlife, resignation about the present and preoccupation with God.\nAgainst this conventional Christian perspective Camus asserts what he\nregards as self-evident facts: that we must die and there is nothing\nbeyond this life. Without mentioning it, Camus draws a conclusion from\nthese facts, namely that the soul is not immortal. Here, as elsewhere\nin his philosophical writing, he commends to his readers to face a\ndiscomforting reality squarely and without flinching, but he does not\nfeel compelled to present reasons or evidence. If not with religion,\nwhere then does wisdom lie? His answer is: with the \u201cconscious\ncertainty of a death without hope\u201d and in refusing to hide from\nthe fact that we are going to die. For Camus \u201cthere is no\nsuperhuman happiness, no eternity outside of the curve of the\ndays\u2026. I can see no point in the happiness of angels\u201d\n(N, 90). There is nothing but this world,\nthis life, the immediacy of the present.\n\nCamus is sometimes mistakenly called a \u201cpagan\u201d because he\nrejects Christianity as based on a hope for a life beyond this life.\nHope is the error Camus wishes to avoid. Rejecting \u201cthe\ndelusions of hope\u201d (N, 74), Nuptials contains\nan evocation of an alternative. Camus relies for this line of thought\non Nietzsche\u2019s discussion of Pandora\u2019s Box in Human,\nAll Too Human: all the evils of humankind, including plagues and\ndisease, have been let loose on the world by Zeus, but the remaining\nevil, hope, is kept hidden away in the box and treasured. But why, we\nmay ask, is hope an evil? Nietzsche explains that humans have come to\nsee hope as their greatest good, while Zeus, knowing better, has meant\nit as the greatest source of trouble. It is, after all, the reason why\nhumans let themselves be tormented\u2014because they anticipate an\nultimate reward (Nietzsche 1878/1996, 58). For Camus, following this\nreading of Nietzsche closely, the conventional solution is in fact the\nproblem: hope is disastrous for humans inasmuch as it leads them to\nminimize the value of this life except as preparation for a life\nbeyond.\n\nIf religious hope is based on the mistaken belief that death, in the\nsense of utter and total extinction body and soul, is not inevitable,\nit leads us down a blind alley. Worse, because it teaches us to look\naway from life toward something to come afterwards, such religious\nhope kills a part of us, for example, the realistic attitude we need\nto confront the vicissitudes of life. But what then is the appropriate\npath? The young Camus is neither a skeptic nor a relativist here. His\ndiscussion rests on the self-evidence of sensuous experience. He\nadvocates precisely what he takes Christianity to abjure: living a\nlife of the senses, intensely, here and now, in the present. This\nentails, first, abandoning all hope for an afterlife, indeed rejecting\nthinking about it. \u201cI do not want to believe that death is the\ngateway to another life. For me it is a closed door\u201d\n(N, 76).\n\nWe might think that facing our total annihilation would be bitter, but\nfor Camus this leads us in a positive direction: \u201cBetween this\nsky and the faces turned toward it there is nothing on which to hang a\nmythology, a literature, an ethic, or a religion\u2014only stones,\nflesh, stars, and those truths the hand can touch\u201d (N,\n90). This insight entails obstinately refusing \u201call the\n\u2018later on\u2019s of this world,\u201d in order to lay claim to\n\u201cmy present wealth\u201d (N, 103), namely the intense\nhere-and-now life of the senses. The \u201cwealth\u201d is precisely\nwhat hope cheats us out of by teaching us to look away from it and\ntowards an afterlife. Only by yielding to the fact that our\n\u201clonging to endure\u201d will be frustrated and accepting our\n\u201cawareness of death\u201d are we able to open ourselves to the\nriches of life, which are physical above all.\n\nCamus puts both sides of his argument into a single statement:\n\u201cThe world is beautiful, and outside there is no\nsalvation\u201d (N, 103). Only in accepting death and in\nbeing \u201cstripped of all hope\u201d does one most intensely\nappreciate not only the physical side of life, but also, he now\nsuggests, its affective and interpersonal side. Taken together, and\ncontrary to an unverifiable faith in God and afterlife, these are what\none has and one knows: \u201cTo feel one\u2019s\nties to a land, one\u2019s love for certain men, to know there is\nalways a place where the heart can find rest\u2014these are already\nmany certainties for one man\u2019s life\u201d (N, 90).\n\nOnly if we accept that Nietzsche is right, that God is dead and there\nis only nothingness after we die, will we then fully\nexperience\u2014feel, taste, touch, see, and smell\u2014the joys of\nour bodies and the physical world. Thus the sensuous and lyrical side\nof these essays, their evocative character, is central to the\nargument. Or rather, because Camus is promoting intense, joyous,\nphysical experience as opposed to a self-abnegating religious life,\nrather than developing an argument he asserts that these experiences\nthemselves are the right response. His writing aims to demonstrate\nwhat life means and feels like once we give up hope\nof an afterlife, so that in reading we will be led to\n\u201csee\u201d his point. These essays may be taken as containing\nhighly personal thoughts, a young man\u2019s musings about his\nMediterranean environment, and they scarcely seem to have any system.\nBut they suggest what philosophy is for Camus and how he conceives its\nrelationship to literary expression.\n\nHis early philosophy, then, may be conveyed, if not summed up, in this\npassage from \u201cNuptials at Tipasa\u201d:\n\nIn a moment, when I throw myself down among the absinthe plants to\nbring their scent into my body, I shall know, appearances to the\ncontrary, that I am fulfilling a truth which is the sun\u2019s and\nwhich will also be my death\u2019s. In a sense, it is indeed my life\nthat I am staking here, a life that tastes of warm stone, that is full\nof the signs of the sea and the rising song of the crickets. The\nbreeze is cool and the sky blue. I love this life with abandon and\nwish to speak of it boldly: it makes me proud of my human condition.\nYet people have often told me: there\u2019s nothing to be proud of.\nYes, there is: this sun, this sea, my heart leaping with youth, the\nsalt taste of my body and this vast landscape in which tenderness and\nglory merge in blue and yellow. It is to conquer this that I need my\nstrength and my resources. Everything here leaves me intact, I\nsurrender nothing of myself, and don no mask: learning patiently and\narduously how to live is enough for me, well worth all their arts of\nliving. (N, 69)\n\n\nThe intense and glistening present tells us that we can fully\nexperience and appreciate life only on the condition that we no longer\ntry to avoid our ultimate and absolute death.\n3. Suicide, Absurdity and Happiness: The Myth of Sisyphus\n\nAfter completing Nuptials, Camus began to work on a planned\ntriptych on the Absurd: a novel, which became The Stranger, a\nphilosophical essay, eventually titled The Myth of Sisyphus,\nand a play, Caligula. These were completed and sent off from\nAlgeria to the Paris publisher in September 1941. Although Camus would\nhave preferred to see them appear together, even in a single volume,\nthe publisher for both commercial reasons and because of the paper\nshortage caused by war and occupation, released The Stranger\nin June 1942 and The Myth of Sisyphus in October. Camus kept\nworking on the play, which finally appeared in book form two years\nlater (Lottman, 264\u201367).\n3.1 Suicide as a Response to Absurdity\n\n\u201cThere is only one really serious philosophical problem,\u201d\nCamus says, \u201cand that is suicide. Deciding whether or not life\nis worth living is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy.\nAll other questions follow from that\u201d (MS, 3). One\nmight object that suicide is neither a \u201cproblem\u201d nor a\n\u201cquestion,\u201d but an act. A proper, philosophical question\nmight rather be: \u201cUnder what conditions is suicide\nwarranted?\u201d And a philosophical answer might explore the\nquestion, \u201cWhat does it mean to ask whether life is worth\nliving?\u201d as William James did in The Will to Believe.\nFor the Camus of The Myth of Sisyphus, however, \u201cShould\nI kill myself?\u201d is the essential philosophical\nquestion. For him, it seems clear that the primary result of\nphilosophy is action, not comprehension. His concern about \u201cthe\nmost urgent of questions\u201d is less a theoretical one than it is\nthe life-and-death problem of whether and how to live.\n\nCamus sees this question of suicide as a natural response to an\nunderlying reality, namely, that life is absurd. It is absurd to\ncontinually seek meaning in life when there is none; and it is absurd\nto hope for some form of continued existence after death, which\nresults in our extinction. But Camus also thinks it absurd to try to\nknow, understand, or explain the world, since he regards the attempt\nto gain rational knowledge as futile. Here Camus pits himself against\nscience and philosophy, dismissing the claims of all forms of rational\nanalysis: \u201cThat universal reason, practical or ethical, that\ndeterminism, those categories that explain everything are enough to\nmake a decent man laugh\u201d (MS, 21).\n\nThese kinds of absurdity are driving Camus\u2019s question about\nsuicide, but his way of proceeding evokes another kind of absurdity,\none less well-defined, namely, the \u201cabsurd sensibility\u201d\n(MS, 2, tr. changed). This sensibility, vaguely described, seems to be\n\u201can intellectual malady\u201d (MS, 2) rather than a\nphilosophy. He regards thinking about it as \u201cprovisional\u201d\nand insists that the mood of absurdity, so \u201cwidespread in our\nage\u201d does not arise from, but lies prior to, philosophy.\nCamus\u2019s diagnosis of the essential human problem rests on a\nseries of \u201ctruisms\u201d (MS, 18) and \u201cobvious\nthemes\u201d (MS, 16). But he doesn\u2019t argue for\nlife\u2019s absurdity or attempt to explain it\u2014he is not\ninterested in either project, nor would such projects engage his\nstrength as a thinker. \u201cI am interested \u2026 not so much in\nabsurd discoveries as in their consequences\u201d (MS, 16).\nAccepting absurdity as the mood of the times, he asks above all\nwhether and how to live in the face of it. \u201cDoes the absurd\ndictate death\u201d (MS, 9)? But he does not argue this\nquestion either, and rather chooses to demonstrate the attitude\ntowards life that would deter suicide. In other words, the main\nconcern of the book is to sketch ways of living our lives so as to\nmake them worth living despite their being meaningless.\n\nAccording to Camus, people commit suicide \u201cbecause they judge\nlife is not worth living\u201d (MS, 4). But if this\ntemptation precedes what is usually considered philosophical\nreasoning, how to answer it? In order to get to the bottom of things\nwhile avoiding arguing for the truth of his statements, he\ndepicts, enumerates, and illustrates. As he says in The\nRebel, \u201cthe absurd is an experience that must be lived\nthrough, a point of departure, the equivalent, in existence, of\nDescartes\u2019s methodical doubt\u201d (R, 4). The\nMyth of Sisyphus seeks to describe \u201cthe elusive\nfeeling of absurdity\u201d in our lives, rapidly pointing out themes\nthat \u201crun through all literatures and all philosophies\u201d\n(MS, 12). Appealing to common experience, he tries to render\nthe flavor of the absurd with images, metaphors, and anecdotes that\ncapture the experiential level he regards as lying prior to\nphilosophy.\n\nHe begins doing so with an implicit reference to Sartre\u2019s novel,\nNausea, which echoes the protagonist Antoine\nRoquentin\u2019s discovery of absurdity. Camus had earlier written\nthat this novel\u2019s theories of absurdity and its images are not\nin balance. The descriptive and the philosophical aspects of the novel\n\u201cdon\u2019t add up to a work of art: the passage from one to\nthe other is too rapid, too unmotivated, to evoke in the reader the\ndeep conviction that makes art of the novel\u201d (Camus 1968, 200).\nBut in this 1938 review Camus praises Sartre\u2019s descriptions of\nabsurdity, the sense of anguish and nausea that arises as the ordinary\nstructures imposed on existence collapse in Antoine Roquentin\u2019s\nlife. As Camus now presents his own version of the experience,\n\u201cthe stage sets collapse. Rising, streetcar, four hours in the\noffice or the factory, meal, streetcar, four hours of work, meal,\nsleep, and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and\nSunday according to the same rhythm \u2026\u201d (MS,\n12\u20133). As this continues, one slowly becomes fully conscious and\nsenses the absurd.\n3.2 The Limits of Reason\n\nCamus goes on to sketch other experiences of absurdity, until he\narrives at death. But although Camus seeks to avoid arguing for the\ntruth of his claims, he nevertheless concludes this \u201cabsurd\nreasoning\u201d with a series of categorical assertions addressed to\n\u201cthe intelligence\u201d about the inevitable frustration of the\nhuman desire to know the world and to be at home in it. Despite his\nintentions, Camus cannot avoid asserting what he believes to be an\nobjective truth: \u201cWe must despair of ever reconstructing the\nfamiliar, calm surface which would give us peace of heart\u201d\n(MS, 18). Turning to experiences that are seemingly obvious\nto large numbers of people who share the absurd sensibility, he\ndeclares sweepingly: \u201cThis world in itself is not reasonable,\nthat is all that can be said\u201d (MS, 21). Our efforts to\nknow are driven by a nostalgia for unity, and there is an inescapable\n\u201chiatus between what we fancy we know and what we really\nknow\u201d (MS, 18).\n\n\u201cWith the exception of professional rationalists, people today\ndespair of true knowledge\u201d (MS, 18). Camus asserts that\nthe history of human thought is characterized by \u201cits successive\nregrets and its impotences\u201d (MS, 18), and that\n\u201cthe impossibility of knowledge is established\u201d\n(MS, 25). When writing more carefully, he claims only to be\ndescribing a certain \u201cclimate,\u201d but in any case his\nbedrock assumptions appear again and again: the world is unknowable\nand life is without meaning. Our efforts to understand them lead\nnowhere.\n\nAvi Sagi suggests that in claiming this Camus is not speaking as an\nirrationalist\u2014which is, after all, how he regards the\nexistentialists\u2014but as someone trying to rationally understand\nthe limits of reason (Sagi 2002, 59\u201365). For Camus the problem\nis that by demanding meaning, order, and unity, we seek to go beyond\nthose limits and pursue the impossible. We will never understand, and\nwe will die despite all our efforts. There are two obvious responses\nto our frustrations: suicide and hope. By hope Camus means just what\nhe described in Nuptials, the religion-inspired effort to\nimagine and live for a life beyond this life. Or, second, as taken up\nat length in The Rebel, bending one\u2019s energies to\nliving for a great cause beyond oneself: \u201cHope of another life\none must \u2018deserve\u2019 or trickery of those who live not for\nlife itself but for some great idea that will transcend it, refine it,\ngive it a meaning, and betray it\u201d (MS, 8).\n\nWhat is the Camusean alternative to suicide or hope? The answer is to\nlive without escape and with integrity, in \u201crevolt\u201d and\ndefiance, maintaining the tension intrinsic to human life. Since\n\u201cthe most obvious absurdity\u201d (MS, 59) is death,\nCamus urges us to \u201cdie unreconciled and not of one\u2019s own\nfree will\u201d (MS, 55). In short, he recommends a life\nwithout consolation, but instead one characterized by lucidity and by\nacute consciousness of and rebellion against its mortality and its\nlimits.\n3.3 Criticism of Existentialists\n\nIn his statement of the problem and its solution, Camus\u2019s tone,\nideas, and style are reminiscent of Nietzsche. \u201cGod is\ndead\u201d is of course their common starting point, as is the\ndetermination to confront unpleasant truths and write against received\nwisdom. At the same time Camus argues against the specific\nphilosophical current with which Nietzsche is often linked as a\nprecursor, and to which he himself is closest\u2014existentialism.\nThe Myth of Sisyphus is explicitly written against\nexistentialists such as Shestov, Kierkegaard, Jaspers, and Heidegger,\nas well as against the phenomenology of Husserl. Camus shares their\nstarting point, which he regards as the fact that they all somehow\ntestify to the absurdity of the human condition. But he rejects what\nhe sees as their ultimate escapism and irrationality, claiming that\n\u201cthey deify what crushes them and find reason to hope in what\nimpoverishes them. That forced hope is religious in all of them\u201d\n(MS, 24).\n\nSartre, too, is subject to Camus\u2019s criticisms\u2014and not just\npolitically as will be described in the following section. Although\nsome of the ideas in The Myth of Sisyphus drew on\nSartre\u2019s Nausea (as noted above), in 1942 Sartre was\nnot yet regarded as an \u201cexistentialist\u201d. But as\nSartre\u2019s philosophy developed, he went on to explore how human\nactivity constitutes a meaningful world from the brute, meaningless\nexistence unveiled in his\n novel[2]\n (Aronson 1980, 71\u201388). In the process, the absurdity of\nNausea becomes the contingency of Being and\nNothingness, the fact that humans and things are simply there\nwith no explanation or reason. As Sartre described it, the absurd is\n\u201cthe universal contingency of being which is, but which is not\nthe basis of its being; the absurd is the given, the unjustifiable,\nprimordial quality of existence\u201d (quoted in Sagi 2002, 57).\nHaving rooted human existence in such contingency, Sartre goes on to\ndescribe other fundamental structures of existence, core human\nprojects, and characteristic patterns of behavior, including freedom\nand bad faith, all of which arise on this basis. The original\ncontingency leads to our desire to undo it, to the futile project to\n\u201cfound being,\u201d in other words the \u201cuseless\npassion\u201d of the project to become God.\n\nFor Sartre absurdity is obviously a fundamental ontological property\nof existence itself, frustrating us but not restricting our\nunderstanding. For Camus, on the other hand, absurdity is not a\nproperty of existence as such, but is an essential feature of our\nrelationship with the world. It might be argued that Sartre\nand Camus are really quite similar, and that the core futility of\nSartre\u2019s philosophy parallels the \u201cdespair\u201d Camus\ndescribes. After all, if Sisyphus\u2019s labor is ultimately futile,\nso is the project to become God. But Sartre rejects the\n\u201cclassical pessimism\u201d and \u201cdisillusionment\u201d he\nfinds in Camus and instead possesses an unCamusean confidence in his\nability to understand and explain this project and the rest of the\nhuman world. Camus, on the contrary, builds an entire worldview on his\ncentral assumption that absurdity is an unsurpassable relationship\nbetween humans and their world (Aronson 2013). He postulates an\ninevitable divorce between human consciousness, with its \u201cwild\nlonging for clarity\u201d (MS, 21) and the\n\u201cunreasonable silence of the world\u201d (MS, 28). As\ndiscussed above, Camus views the world as irrational, which means that\nit is not understandable through reason.\n\nAccording to Camus, each existentialist writer betrayed his initial\ninsight by seeking to appeal to something beyond the limits of the\nhuman condition, by turning to the transcendent. And yet even if we\navoid what Camus describes as such escapist efforts and continue to\nlive without irrational appeals, the desire to do so is built into our\nconsciousness and thus our humanity. We are unable to free ourselves\nfrom \u201cthis desire for unity, this longing to solve, this need\nfor clarity and cohesion\u201d (MS, 51). But it is urgent to\nnot succumb to these impulses and to instead accept absurdity. In\ncontrast with existentialism, \u201cThe absurd is lucid reason noting\nits limits\u201d (MS, 49).\n\nCamus clearly believes that the existentialist philosophers are\nmistaken but does not argue against them, because he believes that\n\u201cthere is no truth but merely truths\u201d (MS, 43).\nHis disagreement rather takes the subtler and less assertive form of\nan immanent critique, pointing out that each thinker\u2019s\nexistentialist philosophy ends up being inconsistent with its own\nstarting point: \u201cstarting from a philosophy of the world\u2019s\nlack of meaning, it ends up by finding a meaning and depth in\nit\u201d (MS, 42). These philosophers, he insists, refuse to\naccept the conclusions that follow from their own premises.\nKierkegaard, for example, strongly senses the absurd. But rather than\nrespecting it as the inevitable human ailment, he seeks to be cured of\nit by making it an attribute of a God who he then embraces.\n\nCamus\u2019s most sustained analysis is of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology. Along with Sartre, Camus praises the early Husserlian\nnotion of intentionality. Sartre saw this notion as revealing a\ndynamic consciousness without contents\u2014the basis for his\nconception of freedom\u2014while Camus is pleased that intentionality\nfollows the absurd spirit in its \u201capparent modesty of thought\nthat limits itself to describing what it declines to explain\u201d\n(MS, 43). However, Camus criticizes Husserl\u2019s later\nsearch in Ideas for Platonic extra-temporal essences as a\nquasi-religious leap inconsistent with his original insight.\n3.4 Happiness in Facing One\u2019s Fate\n\nHow then to remain consistent with absurd reasoning and avoid falling\nvictim to the \u201cspirit of nostalgia\u201d? The Myth of\nSisyphus finds the answer by abandoning the terrain of philosophy\naltogether. Camus describes a number of absurdist fictional characters\nand activities, including Don Juan and Dostoevsky\u2019s Kirolov\n(The Possessed), theater, and literary creation. And then he\nconcludes with the story of Sisyphus, who fully incarnates a sense of\nlife\u2019s absurdity, its \u201cfutility and hopeless labor\u201d\n(MS, 119). Camus sees Sisyphus\u2019s endless effort and\nintense consciousness of futility as a triumph. \u201cHis\nscorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won\nhim that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted\ntoward accomplishing nothing\u201d (MS, 120). After the\ndense and highly self-conscious earlier chapters, these pages condense\nthe entire line of thought into a vivid image. Sisyphus demonstrates\nthat we can live with \u201cthe certainty of a crushing fate, without\nthe resignation that ought to accompany it\u201d (MS, 54).\nFor Camus, Sisyphus reminds us that we cannot help seeking to\nunderstand the reality that transcends our intelligence, striving to\ngrasp more than our limited and practical scientific understanding\nallows, and wishing to live without dying. Like Sisyphus, we are our\nfate, and our frustration is our very life: we can never escape\nit.\n\nBut there is more. After the rock comes tumbling down, confirming the\nultimate futility of his project, Sisyphus trudges after it once\nagain. This \u201cis the hour of consciousness. At each of those\nmoments when he leaves the heights and gradually sinks towards the\nlairs of the gods, he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his\nrock\u201d (MS, 121). Why use the words\n\u201csuperior\u201d and \u201cstronger\u201d when he has no hope\nof succeeding the next time? Paradoxically, it is because a sense of\ntragedy \u201ccrowns his victory.\u201d \u201cSisyphus, proletarian\nof the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his\nwretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his descent\u201d\n(MS, 121). Tragic consciousness is the conclusion of\n\u201cabsurd reasoning\u201d: living fully aware of the bitterness\nof our being and consciously facing our fate.\n\nWhat then is Camus\u2019s reply to his question about whether or not\nto commit suicide? Full consciousness, avoiding false solutions such\nas religion, refusing to submit, and carrying on with vitality and\nintensity: these are Camus\u2019s answers. This is how a life without\nultimate meaning can be made worth living. As he said in\nNuptials, life\u2019s pleasures are inseparable from a keen\nawareness of these limits. Sisyphus accepts and embraces living with\ndeath without the possibility of appealing to God. \u201cAll\nSisyphus\u2019s silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to\nhim. His rock is his thing\u201d (MS, 123).\n\nLucidly living the human condition, Sisyphus \u201cknows himself to\nbe the master of his days.\u201d By becoming conscious of it, Camus\nis saying, he takes ownership of it. In this sense Sisyphus reshapes\nhis fate into a condition of \u201cwholly human origin.\u201d\n\u201cWholly\u201d may be an exaggeration, because after all, death\nis \u201cinevitable and despicable,\u201d but it is the very\ncondition of living. In acknowledging this, Sisyphus consciously lives\nout what has been imposed on him, thus making it into his own end. In\nthe same way, Meursault, protagonist of The Stranger, comes\nto consciousness in that book\u2019s second part after committing the\ninexplicable murder that ends the book\u2019s first part. He has\nlived his existence from one moment to the next and without much\nawareness, but at his trial and while awaiting execution he becomes\nlike Sisyphus, fully conscious of himself and his terrible fate. He\nwill die triumphant as the absurd man.\n\nThe Myth of Sisyphus is far from having a skeptical\nconclusion. In response to the lure of suicide, Camus counsels an\nintensely conscious and active non-resolution. Rejecting any hope of\nresolving the strain is also to reject despair. Indeed, it is\npossible, within and against these limits, to speak of happiness.\n\u201cHappiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They\nare inseparable\u201d (MS, 122). It is not that discovering\nthe absurd leads necessarily to happiness, but rather that\nacknowledging the absurd means also accepting human frailty, an\nawareness of our limitations, and the fact that we cannot help wishing\nto go beyond what is possible. These are all tokens of being fully\nalive. \u201cThe struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill\na man\u2019s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy\u201d\n(MS, 123).\n3.5 Response to Skepticism\n\nWe can compare his conclusion with Pyrrho\u2019s skepticism and\nDescartes\u2019s methodical doubt. First of all, like Pyrrho, Camus\nhas solved his pressing existential issue, namely, avoiding despair,\nby a kind of resolution entailed in accepting our mortality and\nultimate ignorance. But there are two critical differences with\nPyrrho: for Camus we never can abandon the desire to know, and\nrealizing this leads to a quickening of our life-impulses. This last\npoint was already contained in Nuptials, but here is expanded\nto link consciousness with happiness. For Camus, happiness includes\nliving intensely and sensuously in the present coupled with\nSisyphus\u2019s tragic, lucid, and defiant consciousness, his sense\nof limits, his bitterness, his determination to keep on, and his\nrefusal of any form of consolation.\n\nObviously, Camus\u2019s sense of happiness is not a conventional one\nbut Sagi argues it may place him closer to Aristotle than to any other\nthinker insofar as he is championing the full realization of human\ncapacities (Sagi 2002, 79\u201380) Camus is also similar in this to\nNietzsche, who called upon his readers to \u201csay yes to\nlife,\u201d and live as completely as possible at every moment.\nNietzsche\u2019s point was that to be wholly alive means being as\naware of the negative as of the positive, feeling pain, not shunning\nany experience, and embracing life \u201ceven in its strangest and\nhardest problems\u201d (Nietzsche 1888/1954, 562). But how is it\npossible that, by the end of The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus has\nmoved from skepticism (about finding the truth) and nihilism (about\nwhether life has meaning) to advocating an approach to life that is\nclearly judged to be better than others? How does he justify embracing\na normative stance, affirming specific values? This contradiction\nreveals a certain sleight of hand, as the philosopher gives way to the\nartist. It is as an artist that Camus now makes his case for\nacceptance of tragedy, the consciousness of absurdity, and a life of\nsensuous vitality. He advocates this with the image of Sisyphus\nstraining, fully alive, and happy.\n4. Camus and the World of Violence: The Rebel\n\nThis meditation on absurdity and suicide follows closely on the\npublication of Camus\u2019s first novel, The Stranger, which\nalso centered on individual experience and revolves around its\nprotagonist\u2019s senseless murder of an Arab on a beach in Algiers\nand concludes with his execution by guillotine. And it is often\nforgotten that this absurdist novelist and philosopher was also a\npolitical activist\u2014he had been a member of the Algerian branch\nof the French Communist Party in the mid-1930s and was organizer of an\nAlgiers theater company that performed avant-garde and political\nplays\u2014as well as a crusading journalist. From October 1938 until\nJanuary 1940 he worked on Alger r\u00e9publicain and a\nsister newspaper. In June 1939 he wrote a series of reports on famine\nand poverty in the mountainous coastal region of Kabylie, among the\nfirst detailed articles ever written by a European Algerian describing\nthe wretched living conditions of the native population.\n\nAfter the start of World War II, Camus became editor of Le Soir\nr\u00e9publicain and as a pacifist opposed French entry into\nthe war. The spectacle of Camus and his mentor Pascal Pia running\ntheir left-wing daily into the ground because they rejected the\nurgency of fighting Nazism is one of the most striking but least\ncommented-on periods of his life. Misunderstanding Nazism at the\nbeginning of the war, he advocated negotiations with Hitler that would\nin part reverse the humiliations of the Treaty of Versailles. His\npacifism was in keeping with a time-honored French tradition, and\nCamus nevertheless reported for military service out of solidarity\nwith those young men, like his brother, who had become soldiers.\nIntending to serve loyally and to advocate a negotiated peace in the\nbarracks, he was angered that his tuberculosis disqualified him\n(Lottman, 201\u201331; Aronson 2004, 25\u201328).\n\nThese biographical facts are relevant to Camus\u2019s philosophical\ndevelopment after The Myth of Sisyphus. Moving to France and\neventually becoming engaged in the resistance to the German\noccupation, in two \u201cLetters to a German Friend\u201d published\nclandestinely in 1943 and 1944, Camus pondered the question whether\nviolence against the occupiers was justified. He spoke of the\n\u201cloathing we [French] had for all war,\u201d and the need\n\u201cto find out if we had the right to kill men, if we were allowed\nto add to the frightful misery of this world\u201d (RRD, 8).\nDespising war, suspicious of heroism, he claimed that the occupied\nFrench paid dearly for this detour \u201cwith prison sentences and\nexecutions at dawn, with desertions and separations, with daily pangs\nof hunger, with emaciated children, and above all, with humiliation of\nour human dignity\u201d (RRD, 8). Only when we were\n\u201cat death\u2019s door,\u201d and \u201cfar behind\u201d the\nGermans, did we understand the reasons for fighting, so that\nhenceforth we would struggle with a clear conscience and \u201cclean\nhands.\u201d In other words killing was morally permissible only\nwithin strict limits and after great provocation. Our moral strength\nwas rooted in the fact that we were fighting for justice and national\nsurvival. The subsequent letters continued to contrast the French with\nthe Germans on moral grounds drawn directly from Camus\u2019s\nevolving philosophy, and suggested the transition from The Myth of\nSisyphus to The Rebel: if both adversaries began with a\nsense of the world\u2019s absurdity, Camus claimed that the French\nacknowledged and lived within this awareness, while the Germans sought\nto overcome it by dominating the world.\n\nCamus\u2019s anti-Nazi commitment and newspaper experience led to him\nsucceeding Pia in March 1944 as editor of Combat, the main\nunderground newspaper of the non-Communist left. During this period\nCamus worked on The Plague which, as he later said,\n\u201chas as its obvious content the struggle of the European\nresistance movements against Nazism\u201d (LCE, 339). The\nnovel, begun during the war, describes an epidemic of the bubonic\nplague in the small Algerian city of Oran, which transforms every\naspect of daily life and shuts off the city from the surrounding\nworld. The only possible response besides quarantine is refusing to\npassively accept disease and death and to actively organize\n\u201csanitary squads\u201d to combat it. The Plague\nphilosophically anticipates The Rebel: despite\nindividuals\u2019 most ambitious goals, for example of Tarrou who\nseeks to end the death penalty and Father Paneloux, who demands that\nthe people of Oran embrace their guilt and God\u2019s love, the\nactual situation calls for a very limited and specific activity.\nIndividuals must act without fanfare or heroics and above all, in\nsolidarity with each other in seeking to limit the effects of the\nplague. Like Sisyphus, they act in full consciousness of their limits,\nexcept now as a we. The Plague depicts a collective and nonviolent\nresistance to an unexplained pestilence, and thus quite deliberately\ndoes not raise the tactical, strategic, and moral issues built into\nthe struggle of the Resistance against human occupiers (LCE,\n340\u20131). If readers did not see this as an issue in 1947, it\nbecame contentious as the political climate changed, and the novel was\nattacked by Roland Barthes and later by Sartre (Aronson 2004,\n228\u20139). In point of fact, after the Liberation the question of\nviolence continued to occupy Camus both politically and\nphilosophically. In 1945 his was one of the few voices raised in\nprotest against the American use of nuclear weapons to defeat Japan\n(Aronson 2004, 61\u201363). After the Liberation he opposed the death\npenalty for collaborators, then turned against Marxism and Communism\nfor embracing revolution, while rejecting the looming cold war and its\nthreatening violence. And then in The Rebel, Camus began to\nspell out his deeper understanding of violence.\n4.1 Absurdity, Rebellion, and Murder\n\nAt the beginning of The Rebel, Camus picks up where he left\noff in The Myth of Sisyphus. Writing as a philosopher again,\nhe returns to the terrain of argument by explaining what absurdist\nreasoning entails. Its \u201cfinal conclusion\u201d is \u201cthe\nrepudiation of suicide and the acceptance of the desperate encounter\nbetween human inquiry and the silence of the universe\u201d\n(R, 6). Since to conclude otherwise would negate its very\npremise, namely the existence of the questioner, absurdism must\nlogically accept life as the one necessary good. \u201cTo say that\nlife is absurd, consciousness must be alive\u201d (R, 6, tr.\nchanged). Living and eating \u201care themselves value\njudgments\u201d (LCE, 160). \u201cTo breathe is to\njudge\u201d (R, 8). As in his criticism of the\nexistentialists, Camus advocates a single standpoint from which to\nargue for objective validity, that of consistency.\n\nAt first blush, however, the book\u2019s subject seems to have more\nof a historical theme than a philosophical one. \u201cThe purpose of\nthis essay is \u2026 to face the reality of the present, which is\nlogical crime, and to examine meticulously the arguments by which it\nis justified; it is an attempt to understand the times in which we\nlive. One might think that a period which, in a space of fifty years,\nuproots, enslaves, or kills seventy million human beings should be\ncondemned out of hand. But its culpability must still be\nunderstood\u201d (R, 3).\n\nDo such questions represent an entirely new philosophy or are they\ncontinuous with The Myth of Sisyphus? The issue is not\nresolved by the explanations that Camus gives for his shift in the\nfirst pages of The Rebel\u2014by referring to the mass\nmurders of the middle third of the twentieth century. \u201cThe age\nof negation,\u201d he says, once fostered a concern for suicide, but\nnow in \u201cthe age of ideologies, we must examine our position in\nrelation to murder\u201d (R, 4). Have the \u201cages\u201d\nchanged in the less than ten years between the two books? He may be\nright to say that whether murder has rational foundations is\n\u201cthe question implicit in the blood and strife of this\ncentury,\u201d but in changing his focus from suicide to murder, it\nis also clear that Camus is shifting his philosophical optic from the\nindividual to our social belonging.\n\nIn so doing Camus applies the philosophy of the absurd in new, social\ndirections, and seeks to answer new, historical questions. But as we\nsee him setting this up at the beginning of The Rebel the\ncontinuity with a philosophical reading of The Stranger is\nalso strikingly clear. Novelist Kamel Daoud, retelling The\nStranger from the point of view of the victim, correctly\ncalls the murder of his Arab \u201ckinsman\u201d a\n\u201cphilosophical crime\u201d (Daoud 19). At the beginning of\nThe Rebel Camus explains:\n\nAwareness of the absurd, when we first claim to deduce a rule of\nbehavior from it, makes murder seem a matter of indifference, to say\nthe least, and hence possible. \u2026 There is no pro or con: the\nmurderer is neither right nor wrong. We are free to stoke the\ncrematory fires or to devote ourselves to the care of lepers. Evil and\nvirtue are mere chance or caprice. (R, 5)\n\n\nIf historically \u201cmurder is the problem today\u201d (R,\n5), the encounter with absurdity tells us that the same is true\nphilosophically. Having ruled out suicide, what is there to say about\nmurder?\n\nStarting from the absence of God, the key theme of Nuptials,\nand the inevitability of absurdity, the key theme of The Myth of\nSisyphus, Camus incorporates both of these into The\nRebel, but alongside them he now stresses revolt. The act of\nrebellion assumes the status of a primary datum of human experience,\nlike the Cartesian cogito taken by Sartre as his point of departure.\nCamus first expressed this directly under the inspiration of his\nencounter with Being and Nothingness. But in calling it\n\u201crevolt\u201d he takes it in a direction sharply different from\nSartre, who built from the cogito an \u201cessay in phenomenological\nontology.\u201d Ignoring completely the ontological dimension, Camus\nis now concerned with immediate issues of human social experience.\nRevolt, to be sure, still includes the rebellion against absurdity\nthat Camus described in The Myth of Sisyphus, and once again\nhe will speak of rebelling against our own mortality and the\nuniverse\u2019s meaninglessness and incoherence. But The\nRebel begins with the kind of revolt that rejects oppression and\nslavery, and protests against the world\u2019s injustice.\n\nIt is at first, like The Myth of Sisyphus, a single\nindividual\u2019s rebellion, but now Camus stresses that revolt\ncreates values, dignity, and solidarity. \u201cI revolt, therefore we\nare\u201d (R, 22) is his paradoxical statement. But how can\nan I lead to a we? How does \u201cwe are\u201d\nfollow from \u201cI revolt\u201d? How can the individual\u2019s\nexperience of absurdity, and the rebellion against it, stem from,\nproduce, imply, or entail the wider social sense of injustice and\nsolidarity? The we in fact is the subject of The\nRebel, although the title L\u2019Homme\nrevolt\u00e9 suggests that one\u2019s original\nmotivation may be individual. Acting against oppression entails having\nrecourse to social values, and at the same time joining with others in\nstruggle. On both levels solidarity is our common condition.\n\nIn The Rebel Camus takes the further step, which occupies\nmost of the book, of developing his notion of metaphysical and\nhistorical rebellion in opposition to the concept of revolution.\nApplying his philosophical themes directly to politics in the years\nimmediately after the Liberation of France in 1944, Camus had already\nconcluded that Marxists, and especially the Communists, were guilty of\nevading life\u2019s absurdity by aiming at a wholesale transformation\nof society, which must necessarily be violent. And now, in The\nRebel, he describes this as a major trend of modern history,\nusing similar terms to those he had used in The Myth of\nSisyphus to describe the religious and philosophical\nevasions.\n\nWhat sort of work is this? In a book so charged with political\nmeaning, Camus makes no explicitly political arguments or revelations,\nand presents little in the way of actual social analysis or concrete\nhistorical study. The Rebel is, rather, a historically framed\nphilosophical essay about underlying ideas and attitudes of\ncivilization. David Sprintzen suggests these taken-for-granted\nattitudes operate implicitly and in the background of human projects\nand very rarely become conscious (Sprintzen 1988, 123).\n\nCamus felt that it was urgent to critically examine these attitudes in\na world in which calculated murder had become common. Applying his\nabsurdist ideas and insights to politics, in The Rebel Camus\nexplains what he regards as the modern world\u2019s increasingly\norganized and catastrophic refusal to face, accept, and live with\nabsurdity. The book provides a unique perspective\u2014presenting a\ncoherent and original structure of premise, mood, description,\nphilosophy, history, and even prejudice.\n4.2 Against Communism\n\nCamus\u2019s hostility to Communism had its personal, political, and\nphilosophical reasons. These certainly reached back to his expulsion\nfrom the Communist Party in the mid-1930s for refusing to adhere to\nits Popular Front strategy of playing down French colonialism in\nAlgeria in order to win support from the white working class. Then,\nmaking no mention of Marxism, The Myth of Sisyphus is\neloquently silent on its claims to present a coherent understanding of\nhuman history and a meaningful path to the future. His mutually\nrespectful relations with Communists during the Resistance and the\nimmediate postwar period turned bitter after he was attacked in the\nCommunist press and repaid the attack in a series of newspaper\narticles in 1946 entitled \u201cNeither Victims nor\nExecutioners\u201d (Aronson, 2004, 66\u201393).\n\nIn The Rebel Camus insisted that both Communism\u2019s\nappeal and its negative features sprang from the same irrepressible\nhuman impulse: faced with absurdity and injustice, humans refuse to\naccept their existence and instead seek to remake the world.\nValidating revolt as a necessary starting point, Camus criticizes\npolitics aimed at building a utopian future, affirming once more that\nlife should be lived in the present and in the sensuous world. He\nexplores the history of post-religious and nihilistic intellectual and\nliterary movements; he attacks political violence with his views on\nlimits and solidarity; and he ends by articulating the metaphysical\nrole of art as well as a self-limiting radical politics. In place of\nstriving to transform the world, he speaks of\nm\u00e9sure\u2014\u201cmeasure\u201d, in the sense of\nproportion or balance\u2014and of living in the tension of the human\ncondition. He labels this outlook \u201cMediterranean\u201d in an\nattempt to anchor his views to the place he grew up and to evoke in\nhis readers its sense of harmony and appreciation of physical life.\nThere is no substantive argument for the label, nor is one possible\ngiven his method of simply selecting who and what counts as\nrepresentative of the \u201cMediterranean\u201d view while excluding\nothers\u2014e.g., some Greek writers, not many Romans. In place of\nargument, he paints a concluding vision of Mediterranean harmony that\nhe hopes will be stirring and lyrical, binding the reader to his\ninsights.\n\nAs a political tract The Rebel asserts that Communism leads\ninexorably to murder, and then explains how revolutions arise from\ncertain ideas and states of spirit. But he makes no close analysis of\nmovements or events, gives no role to material needs or oppression,\nand regards the quest for social justice as a metaphysically inspired\nattempt to replace \u201cthe reign of grace by the reign of\njustice\u201d (R, 56).\n\nFurthermore, Camus insists that these attitudes are built into\nMarxism. In \u201cNeither Victims nor Executioners\u201d he declared\nhimself a socialist but not a Marxist. He rejected the Marxist\nacceptance of violent revolution and the consequentialist maxim that\n\u201cthe end justifies the\n means.\u201d[3]\n \u201cIn the Marxian perspective,\u201d he wrote sweepingly,\n\u201ca hundred thousand deaths is a small price to pay for the\nhappiness of hundreds of millions\u201d (Camus 1991, 130). Marxists\nthink this, Camus asserted, because they believe that history has a\nnecessary logic leading to human happiness, and thus they accept\nviolence to bring it about.\n\nIn The Rebel Camus takes this assertion a further step:\nMarxism is not primarily about social change but is rather a revolt\nthat \u201cattempts to annex all creation.\u201d Revolution emerges\nwhen revolt seeks to ignore the limits built into human life. By an\n\u201cinevitable logic of nihilism\u201d Communism climaxes the\nmodern trend to deify man and to transform and unify the world.\nToday\u2019s revolutions yield to the blind impulse, originally\ndescribed in The Myth of Sisyphus, \u201cto demand order in\nthe midst of chaos, and unity in the very heart of the\nephemeral\u201d (MS, 10). As does the rebel who becomes a\nrevolutionary who kills and then justifies murder as legitimate.\n\nAccording to Camus, the execution of King Louis XVI during the French\nRevolution was the decisive step demonstrating the pursuit of justice\nwithout regard to limits. It contradicted the original life-affirming,\nself-affirming, and unifying purpose of revolt. This discussion\nbelongs to Camus\u2019s \u201chistory of European pride,\u201d\nwhich is prefaced by certain ideas from the Greeks and certain aspects\nof early Christianity, but begins in earnest with the advent of\nmodernity. Camus focuses on a variety of major figures, movements, and\nliterary works: the Marquis de Sade, romanticism, dandyism, The\nBrothers Karamazov, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, surrealism, the\nNazis, and above all the Bolsheviks. Camus describes revolt as\nincreasing its force over time and turning into an ever more desperate\nnihilism, overthrowing God and putting man in his place, wielding\npower more and more brutally. Historical revolt, rooted in\nmetaphysical revolt, leads to revolutions seeking to eliminate\nabsurdity by using murder as their central tool to take total control\nover the world. Communism is the contemporary expression of this\nWestern sickness.\n\nIn the twentieth century, Camus claims, murder has become\n\u201creasonable,\u201d \u201ctheoretically defensible,\u201d and\njustified by doctrine. People have grown accustomed to \u201clogical\ncrimes\u201d\u2014that is, mass death either planned or foreseen,\nand rationally justified. Thus Camus calls \u201clogical crime\u201d\nthe central issue of the time, seeks to \u201cexamine meticulously\nthe arguments by which it is justified\u201d (R, 3), and\nsets out to explore how the twentieth century became a century of\nslaughter.\n\nWe might justly expect an analysis of the arguments he speaks of, but\nThe Rebel changes focus. Human reason is confused by\n\u201cslave camps under the flag of freedom, massacres justified by\nphilanthropy or by a taste for the superhuman\u201d (R,\n4)\u2014the first two refer to Communism, the third to Nazism. In the\nbody of the text, Nazism virtually drops out (it was, he says, a\nsystem of \u201cirrational terror\u201d\u2014not at all what\ninterested Camus), sharply narrowing the inquiry. His shift is\nrevealed by his question: How can murder be committed with\npremeditation and be justified by philosophy? It turns out that the\n\u201crational murder\u201d Camus was concerned with is not\ncommitted by capitalists or democrats, colonialists or imperialists,\nor by Nazis\u2014but only by Communists.\n\nHe does not address the Holocaust, and although his had been a lone\nvoice of protest against Hiroshima in 1945, he does not now ask how it\nhappened. As a journalist he had been one of the few to indict French\ncolonialism, but he does not mention it, except in a footnote. How was\nit possible for Camus to focus solely on the violence of Communism,\ngiven the history he had lived, in the age of nuclear weapons, in the\nvery midst of the French colonial war in Vietnam, and when he knew\nthat a bitter struggle over Algeria lay ahead? It seems he became\nblinded by ideology, separating Communism from the other evils of the\ncentury and directing his animus there. Camus\u2019s ideas, of\ncourse, had developed and matured over the years since he first began\nwriting about revolt. But something else had happened: his agenda had\nchanged. Absurdity and revolt, his original themes, had been harnessed\nas an alternative to Communism, which had become the archenemy. Even\nas he rejected its violent confrontations, the philosophy of revolt\nbecame Cold-War ideology.\n\nBecause The Rebel claimed to describe the attitude that lay\nbehind the evil features of contemporary revolutionary politics, it\nbecame a major political event. Readers could hardly miss his\ndescription of how the impulse for emancipation turned into organized,\nrational murder as the rebel-become-revolutionary attempted to order\nan absurd universe. In presenting this message, Camus sought not so\nmuch to critique Stalinism as its apologists. His specific targets\nwere intellectuals attracted to Communism\u2014as he himself had been\nin the 1930s.\n\nOne of these targets was Jean-Paul Sartre, and toward the end of\nThe Rebel Camus now took aim at his friend\u2019s evolving\npolitics. Camus focuses on \u201cthe cult of history\u201d against\nwhich the entire book is directed and his belief that \u201cthe\nexistentialists,\u201d led by Sartre, had fallen victim to the idea\nthat revolt should lead to revolution. Within Camus\u2019s framework,\nSartre is challenged as trying, like the predecessors criticized in\nThe Myth of Sisyphus, to escape the absurdity with which his\nown thinking began by turning to \u201chistory,\u201d that is to\nMarxism. This is a bit of a stretch because Sartre was still several\nyears from declaring himself a Marxist, and it shows Camus\u2019s\ntendency towards sweeping generalization rather than close analysis.\nBut it also reflects his awareness that his friend was determined to\nfind a meaning in the world even as he himself foreswore doing so. And\nit shows his capacity for interpreting a specific disagreement in the\nbroadest possible terms\u2014as a fundamental conflict of\nphilosophies.\n4.3 Violence: Inevitable and Impossible\n\nThe concluding chapters of The Rebel are punctuated with\nemphatic words of conclusion (alors, donc,\nainsi, c\u2019est pourquoi), which are rarely\nfollowed by consequences of what comes before and often introduce\nfurther assertions, without any evidence or analysis. They are studded\nwith carefully composed topic sentences for major ideas\u2014which\none expects to be followed by paragraphs, pages, and chapters of\ndevelopment but, instead, merely follow one another and wait until the\nnext equally well-wrought topic sentence.\n\nAs often in the book, the reader must be prepared to follow an\nabstract dance of concepts, as \u201crebellion,\u201d\n\u201crevolution,\u201d \u201chistory,\u201d\n\u201cnihilism,\u201d and other substantives stand on their own,\nwithout reference to human agents. The going gets even muddier as we\nnear the end and the text verges on incoherence. How then is it\npossible that Foley judges The Rebel philosophically as\nCamus\u2019s \u201cmost important book\u201d (Foley 55)?\n\nIn these pages Camus is going back over familiar ground, contrasting\nthe implicit religiosity of a future-oriented outlook that claims to\nunderstand and promote the logic of history, and justifying violence\nto implement it, with his more tentative \u201cphilosophy of\nlimits,\u201d with its sense of risk, \u201ccalculated\nignorance,\u201d and living in the present. However the strain stems\nfrom the fact that he is doing so much more. As he tries to bring the\nbook to a conclusion he is wrestling with its most difficult\ntheme\u2014that the resort to violence is both inevitable and\n\u201cimpossible.\u201d The rebel lives in contradiction. He or she\ncannot abandon the possibility of lying, injustice, and violence, for\nthey are part of the rebel\u2019s condition, and will of necessity\nenter into the struggle against oppression. \u201cHe cannot,\ntherefore, absolutely claim not to kill or lie, without renouncing his\nrebellion and accepting, once and for all, evil and murder.\u201d In\nother words, to not rebel is to become an accomplice of oppression.\nRebellion, Camus has insisted, will entail murder. Yet rebellion,\n\u201cin principle,\u201d is a protest against death, just as it is\na source of the solidarity that binds the human community. He has said\nthat death is the most fundamental of absurdities, and that at root\nrebellion is a protest against absurdity. Thus to kill any other human\nbeing, even an oppressor, is to disrupt our solidarity, in a sense to\ncontradict our very being. It is impossible, then, to embrace\nrebellion while rejecting violence.\n\nThere are those, however, who ignore the dilemma: these are the\nbelievers in history, heirs of Hegel and Marx who imagine a time when\ninequality and oppression will cease and humans will finally be happy.\nFor Camus such a hope resembles the paradise beyond this life promised\nby religions. Living for, and sacrificing humans to, a supposedly\nbetter future is, very simply, another religion. Moreover, his\nsharpest hostility is reserved for intellectuals who theorize and\njustify such movements. Accepting the dilemma, Camus is unable to\nspell out how a successful revolution can remain committed to the\nsolidaristic and life-affirming principle of rebellion with which it\nbegan. He does however suggest two actions which, if implemented,\nwould be signs of a revolution\u2019s commitment to remain\nrebellious: it would abolish the death penalty and it would encourage\nrather than restrict freedom of speech.\n\nIn The Rebel Camus extends the ideas he asserted in\nNuptials, developed in The Myth of Sisyphus, and\nthen foreshadowed in The Plague: the human condition is\ninherently frustrating, indeed absurd, but we betray ourselves and\nsolicit catastrophe by seeking solutions beyond our capacity.\n\u201cThe rebel obstinately confronts a world condemned to death and\nthe impenetrable obscurity of the human condition with his demand for\nlife and absolute clarity. He is seeking, without knowing it, a moral\nphilosophy or a religion\u201d (R, 101). The book sets out\nthe alternative: to accept the fact that we are living in a Godless\nuniverse and rebel against this within limits as do most of the\nmembers of the \u201csanitary squads\u201d in The Plague\n\u2013 or to become a revolutionary, who, like the religious believer\ncommitted to the abstract and total triumph of justice, refuses to\naccept living in the present.\n\nHaving critiqued religion in Nuptials and The\nPlague, Camus is self-consciously exploring the starting points,\nprojects, weaknesses, illusions, and political temptations of a\npost-religious universe. He describes how traditional religion has\nlost its force, and how younger generations have been growing up amid\nan increasing emptiness and a sense that anything is possible. He\nfurther claims that modern secularism stumbles into a nihilistic state\nof mind because it does not really free itself from religion.\n\u201cThen the only kingdom that is opposed to the kingdom of grace\nmust be founded-namely, the kingdom of justice-and the human community\nmust be reunited among the debris of the fallen City of God. To kill\nGod and to build a church are the constant and contradictory purpose\nof rebellion\u201d (R, 103). If rebellion spills over its\nlimits and is given free rein, our modern need to create kingdoms and\nour continuing search for salvation is the path of catastrophe.\n\u201cWhen the throne of God is overturned, the rebel realizes that\nit is now his own responsibility to create the justice, the order, and\nthe unity that he sought in vain within his own condition, and in this\nway to justify the fall of God. Then begins the desperate effort to\ncreate, at the price of crime and murder if necessary, the dominion of\nman\u201d (R, 25). But to restrain oneself from this effort\nis to feel bereft of justice, order, and unity. Camus recognizes that\nhope and the revolutionary drive are essential directions of the\npost-classical Western spirit, stemming from its entire world of\nculture, thought, and feeling. This is the path of the metaphysical\nrebel, who does not see that \u201chuman insurrection, in its exalted\nand tragic forms, is only, and can only be, a prolonged protest\nagainst death\u201d (R, 100).\n5. The Fall\n\nWe have been exploring one of the most interesting and perplexing\naspects of Camus\u2019s thought: his determination to criticize\nattitudes that he finds to be natural and inevitable. For one, the\npossibility of suicide haunts humans, and so does the desire for an\nimpossible order and an unachievable permanence. Existentialist\nwriters had similar insights, but Camus criticizes their inability to\nremain consistent with their initial insight. Similarly, he insists\nthroughout The Rebel that the metaphysical need he sees\nleading to Communism\u2019s terror is universal: he describes it and\nits consequences so that we can better resist it in ourselves as well\nas others. His reflexive anti-Communism notwithstanding, an underlying\nsympathy unites Camus to those revolutionaries he opposes, because he\nfreely acknowledges that he and they share the same starting points,\noutlook, stresses, temptations, and pitfalls. Although in political\nargument he frequently took refuge in a tone of moral superiority,\nCamus makes clear through his skepticism that those he disagrees with\nare no less and no more than fellow creatures who give in to the same\nfundamental drive to escape the absurdity that we all share. This\nsense of moral complexity is most eloquent in his short novel The\nFall, whose single character, Clamence, has been variously\nidentified as everyman, a Camus-character, and a Sartre-character. He\nwas all of these. Clamence is clearly evil, guilty of standing by as a\nyoung woman commits suicide. In him Camus seeks to describe and indict\nhis generation, including both his enemies and himself.\nClamence\u2019s life is filled with good works, but he is a hypocrite\nand knows it. His monologue is filled with self-justification as well\nas the confession of someone torn apart by his guilt but unable to\nfully acknowledge it. Sitting at a bar in Amsterdam, he descends into\nhis own personal hell, inviting the reader to follow him. In telling\nClamence\u2019s story, Camus was clearly seeking to empathize as well\nas describe, to understand as well as condemn. Clamence is a monster,\nbut Clamence is also just another human being (Aronson 2004,\n192\u2013200). Beyond the character and actions of Clamence, The\nFall demonstrates a unique message at the heart of Camus\u2019s\nwriting. Life is no one single, simple thing, but a series of tensions\nand dilemmas. The most seemingly straightforward features of life are\nin fact ambiguous and even contradictory. Camus recommends that we\navoid trying to resolve them. We need to face the fact that we can\nnever successfully purge ourselves of the impulses that threaten to\nwreak havoc with our lives. Camus\u2019s philosophy, if it has a\nsingle meaning, is that we should learn to tolerate, indeed embrace\nthe frustration and ambivalence that humans cannot escape.\n6. Philosopher of the Present\n\nWell into the twenty-first century, the career of Camus\u2019s\nthought, like that of his onetime friend Jean-Paul Sartre, has been\nremarkable. Two generations after his death, his complex and profound\nphilosophical project, as discussed by Srigley, is very much with us\nbecause it seeks not only to critique modernity but reaches back to\nthe ancient world to lay the basis for alternative ways of thinking\nand living in the present. Thus, if in some respects he anticipated\nthe postmodernists, he retained a central metaphysical concern with\nsuch ideas as absurdity and revolt. Unlike postmodernism, Camus was,\nas Jeffrey C. Isaac says, a \u201cchastened humanist\u201d who\nremained deeply attached, as was Hannah Arendt, to \u201cthe language\nof right, freedom, and truth\u201d (Isaac 244).\n\nCamus\u2019s ideas and name have come up again and again during the\ntwenty-first century, not only among philosophers and literary\nscholars, among specialists in a wide variety of fields, in the press\nand among political writers, and in conversations among the general\npublic who read his books or have heard about his ideas. First, his\nexploration of living in a Godless universe has led to his name being\nmentioned often in discussions about religious nonbelief (Aronson\n2011). Yet unlike the \u201cnew atheists\u201d the great nonbeliever\nCamus was never assured enough to declare that God does not exist and\nwas not militantly opposed to religious belief and practice (Carlson\n2014). Even as Camus presents in The Plague a profoundly\ncritical picture of Father Paneloux\u2019s sermons describing the\nplague first as a punishment for human sin and then as a call to\nembrace the divine mystery, for a time the priest nevertheless humbly\njoins the collective project of the \u201csanitary squads.\u201d\n\nSecond, after the 9/11 attack and during the \u201cwar on\nterror,\u201d Camus\u2019s writings on violence became much\ndiscussed. For example The Rebel was explored anew for hints\nabout the motivations behind twenty-first century terrorism. Paul\nBerman deployed Camus in his justification for the \u201cwar on\nterror\u201d against Islamic \u201cpathological mass\nmovements\u201d (Berman 2003, 27\u201333). Foley, on the other hand,\ndevoted attention to the actual relevance of Camus\u2019s attempts to\nthink through the question of political violence on a small-group and\nindividual level. He shows how, both in The Rebel and in his\nplays Caligula and The Just Assassins, Camus brings\nhis philosophy to bear directly on the question of the exceptional\nconditions under which an act of political murder can considered\nlegitimate: (1) The target must be a tyrant; (2) the killing must not\ninvolve innocent civilians; (3) the killer must be in direct physical\nproximity to the victim; and (4) there must be no alternative to\nkilling (Foley 2008, 93). Furthermore, because the killer has violated\nthe moral order on which human society is based, Camus makes the\ndemand that he or she must be prepared to sacrifice his or her own\nlife in return. But if he accepts killing in certain circumstances,\nFoley stresses that Camus rules out mass killing, indirect murder,\nkilling civilians, and killing without an urgent need to remove\nmurderous and tyrannical individuals. These demands rest on the core\nidea of The Rebel, that to rebel is to assert and respect a\nmoral order, and this must be sustained both by clear limits and by\nthe murderer\u2019s willingness to\n die.[4]\n\nDuring the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, sales of\nThe Plague exploded and interest was so great that the\nNew York Times republished its original 1948 review by\nStephen Spender. Hundreds of articles were written about it in all\nlanguages \u2013 by bloggers, artists, cartoonists, journalists,\nCamus specialists, medical practitioners, scholars from every\nconceivable discipline \u2013 and philosophers. Camus\u2019s work\nwas being mined for what it had to teach about living in and coping\nwith the pandemic, including such topics as: functioning amidst the\nabsurdity of a disease that appeared for seemingly no reason at all\n(de Botton 2021); the similarities and differences between his plague\nand ours (Aronson, 2020); living and working within the paralyzing\nexistential fear imposed by the pandemic (Farr 2021); retaining hope\namidst catastrophe (Kabel & Phillipson 2020); and the solidarity\namong members of the \u201csanitary squads\u201d doing so (Illing\n2020). In the face of absurdity and mass death many writers extolled\nthe modest and self-limiting philosophy behind The Plague,\nrooted in The Myth of Sisyphus and further developed in\nThe Rebel: one must act, with others, wherever one happens to\nbe, by simply doing one\u2019s job. As Rieux says:\n\u201cthere\u2019s no question of heroism in all this. It\u2019s a\nmatter of common decency. That\u2019s an idea which may make some\npeople smile, but the only means of fighting a plague is \u2013\ncommon decency\u201d (P,\n 150).[5]\n",
