    "main_text": "Prophecy and Miracles || Miracles\n4.2 Miracles\n\nThe second issue again is distinguishing the true prophet from a\ncharlatan, trickster or even sorcerer. If it is reasonable that God\nappoints prophets, the question that immediately arises is how to\nrecognize them and to justify their claims to prophethood. In response\nto this challenge many thinkers in the Islamicate world, theologians\nand philosophers alike, identified performing miracles as a decisive\nsign of one\u2019s rightful claim to being a prophet (\u02bfAbd\nal-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 568\u20139; Juwayn\u012b Proofs,\n167\u20138; Ibn F\u016brak Mujarrad Maq\u0101l\u0101t,\n176\u201380; and B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b al-Tamh\u012bd,\n141\u201360).\n\nThe Arabic term for a prophet\u2019s miracle is\nmu\u02bfjiza, which means that which shows the\nimpotence of others. Specifically, a miracle is a challenge\nby the prophet to others to perform a similar act, which the others\nare presumably incapable of doing. In general, then, a miracle is any\nextraordinary event that confirms an individual\u2019s claims to\nprophethood (Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 168\u201372). Muslims\nrecognize two kinds of such extraordinary events. The first is any\nevent that follows upon the prophet\u2019s challenge and that is\nhighly unexpected albeit not strictly a violation of the natural\norder. For example, the occurrence of a plague, which ensues after the\nprophet predicts it. Also, the very inimitability of the Qur\u2019an\n(i\u02bfj\u0101z) seems to fall within this category and\noften is cited as the only, yet most convincing, proof of\nMuhammad\u2019s claim to prophethood.\n\n\nAnd if you are in any doubt about what we (God) have sent down to our\nservant, produce a s\u016bra of the like of [this\nQur\u2019an]. (Qur\u2019an 2:23; also see 11:13, 10:38, 17:88 and\n52: 34)\n\n\nThose who were so challenged apparently were impotent to rise to the\nchallenge. The second class of extraordinary events requires the\nactual suspension of natural laws. Examples include, the virgin birth\nand the raising of the dead back to life. (Peterson et al. 2013:\n208\u20139). To distinguish this class from the first, let us call\nthem \u2018supernatural\u2019 miracles or events, namely, something\nthat is both extra-ordinary and indeed outside of the natural order of\nthings.\n\nAlthough many, if not most, medieval Islamic scholars acknowledged\nprophetic miracles, the issue of whether there truly were both kinds\nof miracles remained an important topic of discussion. The theologians\nchampioned the position that there are both kinds. The philosophers,\nwhile not denying that extraordinary acts confirm one\u2019s\nprophethood, maintained that although miracles are exceptionally rare,\nthey remain part of the natural order, and so they held a position\nabout miracles much like the naturalized view of prophecy. Let us look\nat the philosophers\u2019 position and then turn to the\ntheologians\u2019 response to it.\n\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s position may be highlighted here (Avicenna\nDA: 198\u2013200 & ITN2: 105; also see Davidson 1992: 121\u20132\nand Al-Akiti 2004). For Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, performing miracles is one\nof three properties that identify a prophet. We have already seen the\nother two, namely, (1) to divine future and/or absent events and (2)\nto relate religious truths in symbolic form that all can grasp. Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 explains miracles in much the same way that he explains\nthese other two properties of the prophet. The intellect and\nimagination of prophets are of the highest degree possible for humans,\nand so the prophet fully grasps and understands the order of the good\nthat has its ultimate sources in the divine emanation. Additionally,\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 recognizes the well-established fact that\none\u2019s mind and emotions can produce psychosomatic responses even\nin people of limited intellectual power; however, while for the most\nparts these responses are limited to one\u2019s own body, in the case\nof the prophets their minds can affect other bodies, whether animate\nor inanimate. In so doing, they can cause winds to blow, or rains to\nfall and even earthquake as well as healing or bringing illness on\nothers. While for us to day the Avicennan account of miracles might\nappear to border on the occult, within the scientific framework in\nwhich he was working, his position provided a legitimate natural\nexplanation of what otherwise could only be called the miraculous. To\nbe sure, not all philosophers accepted Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\nsuggested naturalistic mechanism to explain the apparently miraculous.\nStill, few denied miracles outright. Thus, even Ibn Rushd apparently\nallowed that there are miracles\u2014as seen in the\nmiraculous practical value of the laws and religious claims embodied\nin Qur\u2019an\u2014while remaining virtually silent on how\nsuch a miracle as the Qur\u2019an could occur.\n\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b provides the theologians\u2019 response to the\nphilosophers in his Incoherence of the Philosophers\n(Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Incoherence, disc. 17; also see Fakhry\n1958: 56\u201378; Marmura 1989; L\u00f3pez-Farjeat 2016:\n131\u2013140). To begin, the Qur\u2019an contains accounts of\nmiracles, some of which clearly appear to be of the supernatural kind,\ne.g., the virgin birth and resurrection from the dead. A literal\nreading of these miracle-stories requires violations of essential or\nnatural causation, that is, regular, non-divine causal series that\npurportedly necessitate their effects. Ghaz\u0101l\u012b complains\nthat on the philosophers\u2019 account, the Quranic stories of\nsupernatural miracles cannot be taken literally.\n\n\nWhoever renders the habitual courses [of nature] a necessary constant,\nmakes all these [miracles] impossible. [The philosophers] have thus\ninterpreted what is said in the Qur\u2019an about the revivification\nof the dead metaphorically. (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Incoherence,\n163 [23])\n\n\nWhile again Ghaz\u0101l\u012b allows for limited metaphorical readings\nof the Qur\u2019an, he does so only in those cases where he believes\nthat the literal sense leads to a genuine absurdity or even\ncontradiction. For example, Quranic passage that when taken literally\nimply that God has a body, for Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, must be read\nmetaphorically, for to be embodied is to be limited and yet\nGod is unlimited. Miracles of the supernatural kind, that is,\nviolations of natural causation and necessitation, in contrast, do not\ninvolve absurdities or outright contradictions. They are admittedly\nrare, but seemingly possible. Moreover, as we have seen, the\ntheologians view natural causation as nothing more than presumption on\nthe part of the philosophers, preferring occasionalism instead. Thus,\nfor Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, absent a proof for the impossibility of\nsupernatural miracles, one should accept the Qur\u2019anic stories as\nliteral accounts of real events. Still, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b does not\nultimately believe that these supernatural miracles should be the\nonly, even the primary, basis for one\u2019s belief in the veracity\nof the Qur\u2019an and Muhammad\u2019s prophethood\n(Ghaz\u0101l\u012b al-Munqidh, 41\u20134\n[Deliverance, 83\u20137]). As for the true proof for the\ninspired nature of the Qur\u2019an, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, in a way that\nforeshadows and even may have influenced Ibn Rushd\u2019s views,\npoints to the effect of a careful study of the Qur\u2019an and the\ntraditions surrounding Muhammad, the effect of which is the\npurification of hearts (ta\u1e63fiyat al-qul\u016bb) Both\nthe miraculous and the practical confirm the divine sovereignty and\ngovernance of all events and testify to the prophetic and miraculous\nnature of the Qur\u2019an.\n",
