    "main_text": "Theory of Knowledge || Sensation and abstraction\n4.1 Sensation and abstraction\n\nScotus adopts the standard medieval Aristotelian view that human\nbeings, alone among the animals, have two different sorts of cognitive\npowers: senses and intellect. The senses differ from the intellect in\nthat they have physical organs; the intellect is immaterial. In order\nfor the intellect to make use of sensory information, therefore, it\nmust somehow take the raw material provided by the senses in the form\nof material images and make them into suitable objects for\nunderstanding. This process is known as abstraction, from the Latin\nabstrahere, which is literally \u201cto drag out.\u201d The\nintellect pulls out the universal, as it were, from the material\nsingular in which it is embedded. This activity is performed by the\nactive or agent intellect, which takes the \u201cphantasms\u201d\nderived from sense experience and turns them into \u201cintelligible\nspecies.\u201d Those species are actualized in the possible or\nreceptive intellect, whose function is to receive and then store the\nintelligible species provided by the active intellect. Scotus denies\nthat the active and passive intellect are really distinct. Rather,\nthere is one intellect that has these two distinct functions or\npowers.\n\nPhantasms do not, however, become irrelevant once the intelligible\nspecies has been abstracted. Scotus holds (just as Aquinas had held)\nthat the human intellect never understands anything without turning\ntowards phantasms (Lectura 2, d. 3, pars 2, q. 1, n. 255).\nThat is, in order to deploy a concept that has already been acquired,\none must make some use of sensory data\u2014although the phantasms\nemployed in using a concept already acquired need not be anything like\nthe phantasms from which that concept was abstracted in the first\nplace. I acquired the intelligible species of dog from phantasms of\ndogs, but I can make use of that concept now not only by calling up an\nimage of a dog but also by (say) imagining the sound of the Latin word\nfor dog. Scotus\u2019s point is simply that there must be some\nsensory context for any act of intellectual cognition.\n\nAnd even that point is not quite as general as my unqualified\nstatement suggests. For one thing, Scotus believes that our\nintellect\u2019s need for phantasms is a temporary state. It is only\nin this present life that the intellect must turn to phantasms; in the\nnext life we will be able to do without them. For another thing,\nScotus argues in his later works that even in this life we enjoy a\nkind of intellectual cognition that bypasses phantasms. He called it\n\u201cintuitive cognition.\u201d\n",
