    "main_text": "Confucianism || The Challenge of the New Trends of Thoughts\n3.3 The Challenge of the New Trends of Thoughts\n\nCh\u014fson Korea was completely devastated by the Japanese invasion during the Imjin War (1592\u20131598), the largest conflict of the sixteenth-century world, involving almost half a million combatants from Korea, Japan, and China, and also by the Manchu-Qing invasions (1627 & 1637). As a result, the classical Korean Neo-Confucianism in its original form began disintegrating. This was shown by a renewed, now more positive interest in the nature of the heart/mind from the perspective of the Yangming Learning, e.g., by Ch\u014fng Chedu \u912d\u9f4a\u6597 (1649\u20131736). We also see the activities of some Korean women Confucians philosophers, e.g., Im Yunjidang \u4efb\u5141\u646f\u5802 (1721\u20131793) and Kang Ch\u014fngildang \u59dc\u975c\u4e00\u5802 (1772\u20131832) (Ivanhoe & Wang forthcoming). But, more prominently, in the eighteenth century, a group of philosophers more perceptive about the socio-political reality in Korea began rejecting the metaphysically oriented framework which the Four-Seven Debate presupposed, and supplied instead highly naturalistic principles of cosmology and Sage Learning in what is called \u201cPractical Learning (\u5be6\u5b78)\u201d today. These philosophers include Yu Hy\u014fngwon \u67f3\u99a8\u9060 (1622\u20131673) and Yi Ik \u674e\u7037 (1681\u20131763) inter alia. Among them were also members of the school called \u201cNorthern Learning\u201d (Pukhakpa \u5317\u5b78\u6d3e) with an intense interest in the new ideas and technology from Qing China. These scholars included Hong Taeyong \u6d2a\u5927\u5bb9 (1731\u20131783: pen name: Tamh\u014fn \u6e5b\u8ed2), Pak Chiwon \u6734\u8dbe\u6e90 (1737\u20131805), and Pak Cheka \u6734\u9f4a\u5bb6 (1750\u20131850). All these were reformist thinkers who aspired to renovate what they viewed as outdated ideas and forms of life of the scholars and society of their times. In particular, Practical Learning scholars shared a general emphasis on utility and the enhancement of the well-being of the human experience.\n\nBut it was Ch\u014fng Yagyong \u4e01\u82e5\u93de (1762\u20131836, pen name: Tasan \u8336\u5c71) who offered the most extensive criticisms of the tradition and constructed a new system, sometimes even borrowing from the Jesuit writings to create a new form of Neo-Confucianism. Above all, he clearly de-constructed Neo-Confucian Principle-Vital Force paradigm and shifted it into a new paradigm by (partially) integrating Western theories (without denouncing the core elements of Confucianism). He rejects the Principle-Vital Force structure because there is no room for emotion in Principle and Vital Force and they do not incorporate the volitional activities of the agent (Baker 2010). As you recall, the Classical Neo-Confucianism holds that the heart/mind has transcendent nature as its Essence (ch\u2019e). In term of its endowment, i.e., Essence, the heart/mind is basically its Heaven-imparted nature. But in terms of its function, the human heart/mind consists in its variegated feelings. Tasan does not deny that the heart/mind has nature but he does deny that Principle (i) is the essence of the heart/mind in the way the traditional Neo-Confucianism suggests, i.e., in its transcendental character. What is most striking in Tasan\u2019s philosophy of the human person is the view that the human nature is the integral aspect of the heart/mind that exclusively lies in its inclination (\u55dc\u597d kiho), i.e., liking what is good and disliking what is evil. This inclination is thoroughly spontaneous and automatic without any addition or admixture from without, and is thus innate. Human nature is merely a moment or a character of the heart/mind. While readily acknowledging that the heart/mind and its inborn inclination \u201cform a unified human character\u201d, Tasan makes clear that the nature here, instead of expressing any transcendental value, must refer to the spontaneous liking inherent in the heart/mind. So we cannot be praised or for that matter blamed just for having it. Our nature is innately inclined to the moral good just as the bees are innately inclined to protect their queen. In this sense, this nature is fixed. The full characteristics and merits of the heart/mind then cannot be exhausted by its nature (Ivanhoe 2016).\n\nIs the nature of the human heart/mind then originally good? Tasan does not discuss this question directly, but we can infer that his answer must be two-fold. Understood as the inborn inclination in favor of what is good, it must be originally good. However, in terms of its actual execution, the heart/mind is a mere potentiality of good and evil. In other words, the heart/mind as the core of moral responsibility is widely open to options. This suggests that the heart/mind also has other components. For example, the human heart/mind has the power of autonomy (\u81ea\u4e3b\u4e4b\u6b0a) or balance (\u6b0a\u8861) (The Essential Teachings of the Mencius in The Complete Works of Y\u014fyudang Ch\u014fng Yagyong II, 5:33b). This is the ability by which one is able to do what is good or evil without being determined by anything external or its internal nature. It is clear that this power resides in the heart/mind. When the heart/mind with the power of autonomy finally issues an action, then it will be evaluated as praiseworthy or blameworthy. But in order to issue an action, the heart/mind must first engage in the exquisite power of intelligence (\uf9b3\u660e). This is the practical capacity for deliberating and valuing. It also holds the power of implementation, the ability to carry out what is determined to be valuable even against the stimulations of the exterior. With the doctrine of the power of autonomy, Tasan turns out to be the first philosopher in all of East Asia who explicitly advocated the philosophy of freedom at the foundation of human agency and morality. Thus we can see a sort of Catholic (Thomist)-Confucian synthesis working in his philosophy. Tasan cautiously and selectively embraces Thomistic philosophy transmitted to him by the Jesuit Matteo Ricci and makes a paradigm shift into a whole new unique system of Confucianism (Baker 2002).\n\nThere is no denying that, even for Tasan, Vital Force is what is responsible for individuality in the world. But he flatly rejects the view that this Vital Force is ultimately derived from Principle. In particular, he rejects the classical view of Supreme Ultimate (C. Taiji) according to which all is derived from the polarity of yin and yang. What then could be the ultimate source of being in the world? In order to answer this question, we now have to turn to Tasan\u2019s view of Heaven. For Tasan, \u201cHeaven\u201d typically means the absolute personal being. In this regard, he frequently calls it \u201cLord on High (sangje C. shangdi)\u201d. Supreme Ultimate surely is the beginning process of the world that is governed by Lord on High, but the former is not itself the dynamic principle and the origin of all things. Indeed, Lord on High is a personal God who is the governor of the universe and the source of its moral order (Lectures on Zhongyong in The Complete Works of Y\u014fyudang Ch\u014fng Yagyong I, 8:30; Self-Admonition on Zhongyong in The Complete Works of Y\u014fyudang Ch\u014fng Yagyong II, 3:5). Lord on High is also providential, i.e., he cares for his creatures. It is now clear that Tasan rejects the orthodox conception of Principle or Supreme Ultimate as the ultimate ground of morality because an impersonal principle cannot justify morality. Supreme Ultimate as the metaphysical principle cannot provide any mechanism for praise or blame. In other words, given the orthodox view of Principle, it is not clear how the morally depraved would be sanctioned while the morally virtuous would be rewarded in the mechanistic, impersonal scheme of orthodox Supreme Ultimate. In being the ruler and providential power of the world, Lord on High is clearly different from the myriad creatures. For this reason, Tasan regards Lord on High as the spiritual being par excellence, i.e., kwisin (C. guishen). For this reason spiritual beings are the invisible entities that ought to be the objects of worship in sacrificial rites (H. Kim 2019b).\n\nLet us now pause for a moment and reflect on the way the philosophical spirit developed in Chos\u014fn Korea; the Chos\u014fn thought started with a strong Principle-Vital Force dualism but, as it progressed further, many ended up embracing a Vital Force-inclined view. For example, S\u014f Ky\u014fngdok (1489\u20131546: pen name: Hwadam) was the first major philosopher who advocated the philosophy based on Vital Force.\n\nHwadam\u2019s philosophy of Vital Force is designed to promote a unified view of the world and life by way of overcoming divisive ways of thinking and living. With the notion of Vital Force, he presents an interpretation of reality that negates any essential separation among the diverse entities of this world. For him, we can promote the vitality of life by overcoming divisions when we harmonize among ourselves and with nature (J. Kim 2015: 95). As a Confucian, he thus offers the value of communal life integrated by Vital Force. Far from what he conceives to be the externally existing Buddhist emptiness, Hwadam advocates the internal vacuity (h\u014f \u865b) of dynamic energy which inheres in Vital Force (S\u014f 2004: 196). \n\nThis ki-oriented trend not only influenced the philosophy of Yulgok, as we observed above, but it also intensified after the two great wars and culminated in the philosophies of Hong Taeyong, Ch\u2019oe Hangi (1803\u20131879 pen name: Hyegang) as well as Ch\u2019oe Che-u (1824\u20131864). To begin with, Hong advocated a highly idiosyncratic Vital Force-oriented vision of the world that is neither absolutist nor relativist. Influenced by Zhang Zai, Daoism and Western ideas in his development of Vital Force, Hong argued that Vital Force is not only the metaphysical basis but also explanatory foundation of the nature of the myriad entities of the universe. Indeed, for him, there is nothing that is not permeated by Vital Force. As he puts it, Vital Force has no \u201cinside or outside or beginning or end\u201d (Hong Uisanmundap  [2011: 39\u201340]). Further, macroscopic objects in the world are generated by means of the \u201ctransformation of Vital Force (kihwa \u6c23\u5316)\u201d. For Hong, then, all entities, including humans, which are created naturally through the process of the transformation of Vital Force, arise from an ideal state, which he calls \u201ca vastly harmonious world (t\u2019aehwachisae \u592a\u548c\u4e4b\u4e16)\u201d. From this general starting point, Hong moves on to an axiological suggestion that all things are on an equal footing as they all possess the power of living together in their own respective ways (Uisanmundap [2011: 34\u201336]). Clearly opposing the anthropocentric view, he advocates the view that all things are equal in value. Thus, we may say that he holds a holistic view of the world in which various things are organically and harmoniously integrated (Hong Sims\u014fngmun  [2008: 148\u20139]).\n\nThis pattern of thought is further strengthened by Hyegang. In various works, he finally dispenses with Principle for good and promotes Vital Force alone as the ultimate source of reality of the world. He also emphasizes the pragmatic-experimental spirit in our investigation of nature. For Hyegang, Vital Force fills the heaven and earth, i.e., the whole universe. No matter whether it aggregates and disperses, there is nothing that is not Vital Force (Penetration of Spirit and Vital Force (singit\u2019ong \u795e\u6c23\u901a) Book 1, Sec. 1 in Ch\u2019oe Han\u2019gi Expanded Work, Volume 1). Thus, because of Vital Force that composes it, the whole world is alive and active. However, the most interesting aspect of his idea is that the concept of Principle (i \u7406) is entirely reduced to Vital Force. For him, Principle means the coherent logical principle (\u689d\u7406) of Vital Force. When Vital Force is invoked, Principle already resides in Vital Force. When Principle is mentioned, Vital Force follows Principle. For this reason, the statement that Principle is one and its manifestations are many (\u7406\u4e00\u5206\u6b8a), which is one of the common Neo-Confucian interpretations of Principle, is now replaced by the dictum that Vital Force is one and its manifestations are many (\u6c23\u4e00\u5206\u6b8a).\n\nIn his later work, Kihak (\u6c23\u5b78 Learning of Vital Force), he incorporates the concept of unhwa \u904b\u5316 (circling/movement and transformation/change) to describe the idea of Vital Force. Here he invokes two kinds of Vital Force of hy\u014fgjil (\u5f62\u8cea\u4e4b\u6c23 Vital Force of form and tangible quality) and Vital Force of unhwa (\u904b\u5316\u4e4b\u6c23). The earth, moon, sun, star, and all other substantial, thus, tangible, bodies are Vital Force of form and tangible quality, while the more basic phenomena such as rain, sunlight, wind, snow, coldness, hotness, dryness, humidity are Vital Force of circling/transformation. We can say that Vital Force of form and tangible quality supervenes on the aggregation of Vital Force of circling/transformation (Learning of Vital Force, \u6c23\u5b78, Book 1. Sec. 6, Ch\u2019oe Han\u2019gi Expanded Work, Volume 1).\n\nToward the end of the nineteenth century amid the onset of the foreign/Western influences, Ch\u2019oe Che-u invented the first indigenous system of philosophy/religion (called \u201cTonghak (Eastern Learning)\u201d with an emphasis on the internalized conception of Heaven in humans. As the creator of the revolutionary movement, Ch\u2019oe calls the ultimate reality \u201cSupreme Vital Force\u201d (chiki \u81f3\u6c23). Thus, Vital Force plays a decisive role in his Weltanschauung. However, it is not the same notion of Vital Force found in the traditional Neo-Confucian Principle-Vital Force scheme of things. For, in Tonghak, \u201cVital Force\u201d here means \u201cdynamic, creative energy\u201d instead of the material force that can be the cause of moral evil. Further, Ch\u2019oe does not think that Vital Force here is subject to regulation by the unifying and controlling norm of Principle. The Vital Force in Tonghak is the energy or spirit that permeates all things in the world. Human beings are no exception. This is the reason why humans can be united with Supreme Vital Force. In this sense Vital Force is a spiritual energy guarding the heart-mind (\u5b88\u5fc3\u6b63\u6c23) (Choe, \u201cnonhakmun,\u201d Tongky\u014fng Taech\u014fn). Human beings, like everything else in the universe, is an expression of the Supreme Vital Force (Ch\u2019oe Che-u, \u201cincantation,\u201d Tongky\u014fng Taech\u014fn).\nThus, Ch\u2019oe seems to hold a strong Vital Force monism (without any metaphysical transcendent Principle, forms, etc.) (\u6df7\u5143\u4e00\u6c23). The conception of Vital Force is rather heavily colored by the Korean native shamanism (musok or mugyo). Indeed Ch\u2019oe\u2019s Tonghak has a lot of shamanistic elements including the 21-syllable mantra. It also has a Daoist component such as the idea of transformation by doing nothing (\u7121\u7232\u800c\u5316). Also, Supreme Vital Force not only represents the ultimate reality but also describes the nature of the ultimate reality Ch\u014fnju or Hanullim (God). For this reason, Vital Force goes beyond a personal spiritual aspect and refers to the cosmological character of all things. It is also found in inanimate beings. In this respect, nature as a whole is one. The ultimate reality is found in all things. Ch\u2019oe\u2019s view is panentheism, we may say. The concept of God (hanullim) is certainly personal in that it has an infinite will and power (\u9020\u5316) but it is also a universal concept of the ultimate reality (Ch\u2019oe, Tongkyong Taejeon).\n",
