    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nNicole Oresme was born around 1320 in the diocese of Bayeux in\nNormandy, possibly in the village of Allemagne (now Fleury-sur-Orne)\non the outskirts of the Norman city of Caen (Burton 2007, 6). By\n1341/42 he had obtained his master of arts at the University of Paris\nand was probably teaching philosophy there (Courtenay 2000, 544;\nBurton 2007, 7). In 1348 his name appears on a list of graduate\nscholarship holders in theology at the College of Navarre at the\nUniversity of Paris. Oresme became Grand Master of the College in\n1356, so he must have completed his doctorate in theology before this\ndate. Oresme held this position till 1362 and was teaching master in\nthe faculty of theology during that time (Burton 2007, 10). A detailed\naccount of Oresme\u2019s career as a scholar has been provided by\nLejbowicz (2014).\n\nFrom 1362, when he left the university, until his death in 1382,\nOresme served Charles, the dauphin of France, who was regent during\nhis father\u2019s captivity (1356\u20131364) and was crowned King\nCharles V on his father\u2019s death (1364) (Burton 2007,\n11\u201313). Oresme was appointed canon (1362) and later dean (1364)\nof the Cathedral of Rouen and also canon at Sainte-Chapelle in Paris\n(1363) (Clagett 1974, 223). Oresme was elected bishop of Lisieux in\n1377 and was consecrated in 1378. He died on July 11, 1382.\n",
