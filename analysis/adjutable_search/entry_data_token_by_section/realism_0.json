    "main_text": "Preliminaries\n1. Preliminaries\n\nThree preliminary comments are needed. Firstly, there has been a great\ndeal of debate in recent philosophy about the relationship between\nrealism, construed as a metaphysical doctrine, and doctrines in the\ntheory of meaning and philosophy of language concerning the nature of\ntruth and its role in accounts of linguistic understanding (see\nDummett 1978 and Devitt 1991a for radically different views on the\nissue). Independent of the issue about the relationship between\nmetaphysics and the theory of meaning, the well-known disquotational\nproperties of the truth-predicate allow claims about objects,\nproperties, and facts to be framed as claims about the truth of\nsentences. Since:\n\n\u2018The moon is spherical\u2019 is true if and only if the moon is\nspherical,\n\n\nthe claim that the moon exists and is spherical independently of\nanyone\u2019s beliefs, linguistic practices and conceptual schemes,\ncan be framed as the claim that the sentences \u2018The moon\nexists\u2019 and \u2018The moon is spherical\u2019 are true\nindependently of anyone\u2019s beliefs, linguistic practices,\nconceptual schemes and so on. As Devitt points out (1991b: 46)\navailing oneself of this way of talking does not entail that one sees\nthe metaphysical issue of realism as \u2018really\u2019 a semantic\nissue about the nature of truth (if it did, any question about any\nsubject matter would turn out to be \u2018really\u2019 a semantic\nissue).\n\nSecondly, although in introducing the notion of realism above mention\nis made of objects, properties, and facts, no theoretical weight is\nattached to the notion of a \u2018fact\u2019, or the notions of\n\u2018object\u2019 and \u2018property\u2019. To say that it is a\nfact that the moon is spherical is just to say that the object, the\nmoon, instantiates the property of being spherical, which is just to\nsay that the moon is spherical. There are substantial metaphysical\nissues about the nature of facts, objects, and properties, and the\nrelationships between them (see Mellor and Oliver 1997 and Lowe 2002,\npart IV), but these are not of concern here.\n\nThirdly, as stated above, Generic Realism about the mental or the\nintentional would strictly speaking appear to be ruled out ab\ninitio, since clearly Jones\u2019 believing that Cardiff is in\nWales is not independent of facts about belief: trivially, it is\ndependent on the fact that Jones believes that Cardiff is in Wales.\nHowever, such trivial dependencies are not what are at issue in\ndebates between realists and non-realists about the mental and the\nintentional. A non-realist who objected to the independence dimension\nof realism about the mental would claim that Jones\u2019 believing\nthat Cardiff is in Wales depends in some non-trivial sense on\nfacts about beliefs, etc.\n",
