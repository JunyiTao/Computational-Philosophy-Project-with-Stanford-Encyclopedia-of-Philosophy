Political Authority as Grounded in Associative Obligations\n\n\nOne classical account of political authority has modeled political\nauthority and the attendant obligations on the obligations of family\nand the authority of the parents. Plato gives this account of authority\nand obligation among others in the Crito (Plato 1948). A recent attempt\nto ground the legitimacy of political authority in this way is Ronald\nDworkin's (Dworkin 1986). This view is meant to capture the idea that a\npolitical society can have legitimate authority even if it is not a\nvoluntary association and even if there is disagreement on many\npolitical principles.\n\n\nIf we take the family as a model here, we can see that children\nacquire obligations to obey their parents and to love and support their\nparents and siblings without having voluntarily entered into the\nrelationships. And there may be some relation of authority between\nparents and children at least till the latter reach the age of\nmaturity. Another model Dworkin invokes is that of friendship. He\nargues that though friendship does have an important voluntary\ncomponent, it is not the case that people voluntarily agree to the\nterms of a friendship. They find themselves acquiring obligations of\nfriendship as the friendship grows. Of course there is little in the\nway of authority in friendship and even in the family there is little\nauthority once the children reach maturity.\n\n\nThe analogy between obligations of family, friendship and political\nsociety is grounded in the idea that in all three of these, individuals\nare obligated to abide by the rules or norms of the community. Dworkin\nargues that legitimate political authority arises as a consequence of\nthe acquisition on the part of members of a political society of\nobligations to obey the rules of a genuine associative community. This\ngives the putative authority justification for coercing the members\ninto obedience of the rules, which is the key element of authority on\nDworkin's account.\n\n\nDworkin attempts to discern the basis of obligation in friendships\nand families by the process of interpretation of these social\npractices. His thesis is that communities that satisfy four conditions\nfor being genuine communities thereby generate obligations to go along\nwith the terms of the association. The four conditions are: one, each\nmember of the community sees herself as having special obligations to\nthe other members; two, they see the obligations as owed to each of the\nothers personally; three, these obligations are understood to flow from\na concern for the well being of each of the members; and four, the\nobligations are understood as flowing from a plausible version of equal\nconcern for all the members. Any community that satisfies these four\nconditions is a genuine community and thereby generates obligations in\neach of the members to comply with the terms of the association.\n\n\nDworkin thinks that families and friendships satisfy these\nconstraints in many cases and that only when they satisfy them do they\ngenerate obligations. He also thinks that a certain kind of political\nsociety can satisfy these conditions, which he calls a community of\nprinciple, i.e., a community wherein each member sees himself or\nherself as bound by common principles to all the others.\n\n\nOne might worry that a political society cannot be expected to\ngenerate the kinds of emotional bonds people have towards one another\nin families or friendships (Simmons 2001). And one might think that in\nthe absence of such bonds, the four conditions will not be satisfied.\nDworkin denies this. He agrees that political societies do not generate\nthese kinds of emotional bonds, but he asserts that emotional bonds are\nnot necessary either causally or conceptually to the satisfaction of\nthe four conditions.\n\n\nDworkin argues that the attribution of the four conditions to a\nrelationship occurs through an interpretation of that relationship so\nit need not be the case that each person is aware of satisfying any of\nthe four conditions when they do. Consider a person who appeals to his\nfellow citizens on the basis of a principle of freedom of speech on the\ngrounds that it is part of their constitution. This person is committed\nto legal principles that he shares with other citizens. He will be\ncommitted to the principles underlying the other elements of the\nconstitution and the legal history of his country. He will be committed\nto a principle of equality to the extent that it is part of the\nconstitution. We can interpret this person's behavior and the similar\nbehavior of others as committed to special obligations to their fellow\ncountrymen to the extent that it is the shared constitution they are\nappealing to. We can interpret this person as expressing a kind of\nequal concern for his fellow countrymen to the extent that he is\nappealing to legal principles that protect all. And we can interpret\nhim in this way even if he himself would not have asserted it. And to\nthe extent that people conform to this kind of practice more generally,\nwe can interpret their behavior generally as satisfying the four\nconditions of associative obligation.\n\n\nThe community of principle satisfies the four conditions. Dworkin\nattempts to show how a political community can generate special\nobligations of citizens to each other. A community of principle is\nregulated by principles that have been elaborated in a distinctive way\nin the particular community. Citizens see themselves as obligated to\nabide by those principles only in relation to the others who have\nparticipated in elaborating them. The principles do require that\neveryone be included and that everyone's well being counts and counts\nequally.\n\n\nThe idea of a community of principle is meant to accommodate\nsignificant disagreement in the society in two ways. First, people may\nnot think that the principles in the society are the best ones. They\nmay simply be the best interpretation of their shared legal culture and\nhistory. So people may try to advance their own conceptions of the best\nprinciples. Second, people will disagree about the best interpretations\nof the shared legal culture and thus may think that the society is\ngrounded in different principles.\n",
