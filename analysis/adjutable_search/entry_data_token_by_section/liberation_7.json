    "main_text": "Currents || The Problematicizing\n4. Themes and Debates\n\nPhilosophical currents have distinct profiles not only because of the\ntheses that define their methods and approaches, but also because of\nthe themes and problems that remain their preoccupations despite\nchanges and the incorporation of new methods and theses. The\nphilosophy of liberation has since its inception taken up the\nfollowing themes.\n\nThe question of populism. At the heart of the philosophy of\nliberation is the problem of the historical subject of liberation.\nThis problem has been addressed in terms of the idea of the\n\u201cpueblo\u201d or people. Yet, this has been defined in\na variety of ways: as an ethnocultural historical formation; as a\nsocio-economic entity; as a cultural entity that transcends both\nnations and classes; as what is to be forged through a democratic\npolitical project. The problem of what or who is the\n\u201cpeople\u201d has taken on a new urgency as new forms of\ndemocratic participation have emerged, and as Latin American nations\nfind themselves more integrated economically and politically due to\nhemispheric transformations. The political transformations of the last\ndecade throughout Latin America, away from revolutionary violence and\ntowards political participation, have been addressed in terms of the\nneed to rethink the issues of political representation and\nparticipation.\n\nThe question of the subject. This problem is the other side\nof the question about the historical subject of liberation. What is\nthe relationship between the individual subject, whether it be\nconceive as an epistemic or ethical agent, and their belonging to a\nmacro-historical subject, where this may be conceived as \u201cel\npueblo\u201d that is either a national-cultural unit, or a\ntransnational, cultural entity, such as the \u201cAmericas\u201d. As\na chapter in phenomenological-hermeneutical philosophy, the philosophy\nliberation has addressed the nature of the particular and distinct\nembodied, free, historically located, and dependent subject. The\nembodied and historical situatedness of the agent is continuously\naddressed from the standpoint of the most deprived and most vulnerable\nin the collective historical subject that is always under\nquestion.\n\n The Question of Gender/Race. As in the liberation of\ntheology, the philosophy of liberation was initially slow to address\nthe questions of both gender and race, although the later was always a\ncentral theme of Latin American philosophy in general. The issue of\nrace was addressed in terms of mestizaje, blanqueamiento\n(whitening, i.e. the idea that through racial mixing Blacks would\nbecome White and thus assimilate into the broader society),\nindigenity, negritude, and racial mixing in general. Mestizaje,\nhowever, has tended to cover up the distinct role that race has played\nin the formation of Latin American identity. The question of gender,\nnonetheless, was explicitly addressed by Enrique Dussel as early as\n1977 in the third volume of his Filosof\u00eda Etica\nLatinoamericana (Dussel 1977), in which he developed an erotics of\nLatin American liberation. In 1980 Dussel published\nLiberaci\u00f3n de la Mujer y Er\u00f3tica Latinoamericana,\nwhich is made up of re-edition of the seventh chapter of this third\nvolume, along with a new text titled \u201cToward a Metaphysics of\nFeminity,\u201d which as the title suggests aims to offer a\nmetaphysical understanding of gender, in which woman is the\n\u201cOther\u201d of man. Dussel\u2019s metaphysics was critiqued\nfor being an anachronistic and \u201cmachista\u201d ontologization\nof Catholic, in particular, and Christian, more generally,\nunderstandings of sex and gender that negated the historical\ncontingency of gender roles that resulted in a recalcitrant rejection\nof sexual difference other than man/woman (Schutte 1993). In the\nepilogue to the 1994 edition of Liberaci\u00f3n de la Mujer y\nEr\u00f3tica Latinoamericana, Dussel, however, rejected and\ncritiqued his earlier views, noting that the Latin American feminism\nof the sixties was primarily oriented towards a critique of North\nAmerican feminism, and that the category of \u201cgender\u201d had\nnot yet being thoroughly absorbed and appropriated within Latin\nAmerican thinking. He also rejected the unintended\n\u201chomophobic\u201d dimension of his earlier call for an\n\u201cErotics\u201d of Latin American liberation. Over the last\nthree decades, in dialogue with Linda Alcoff, Lynda Lange, Maria\nLugones, Ofelia Schutte, and Elina Vuola (Alcoff and Mendieta, eds.\n2000), as well as theologians such as Maria Clara Bingemer,\n\u00a0Ivone Gebara, and Elsa Tamez, philosophers of liberation have\nbegan to address what Lugones has called \u201cthe coloniality of\ngender\u201d (Lugones 2010). \n\nThe question of utopia. As a philosophical movement defined\nby the quest for liberation, the philosophy of liberation has had to\nalways address the question of the role of utopia in energizing\nindividual and social movements. The question of utopia, however, is\nthe problem of the collective imaginary that projects goals that will\nguide transformative movements. Yet, at the same time, such\ntransformative imaginaries are criticized because of their lack of\nfeasibility or operability.\n\nThe question of history. The significance of history is a\nproblematic that threads the entire current and tradition of the\nphilosophy of liberation, not only because \u201cdependency\u201d\nand \u201cliberation\u201d are understood as historical issues, but\nbecause the very project of liberation is to be undertaken from within\nhistory. Indeed, even in its most \u201contological\u201d and\n\u201canalectical\u201d versions, the philosophy of liberation is\nalways addressing the historical character of human existence.\nCollectively, philosophers of liberation affirm that historical\nindexicality of freedom, that is, that human freedom cannot be\nunderstood in the abstract, but only against a very specific\nhistorical conditions that are material because they take the form of\nsocio-political institutions. For philosophers liberation, human\nliberty must be embodied and material precisely because it is part of\na dynamic historical reality.\n\nThe question of democracy and social order. The philosophy of\nliberation was defined as much by its resistance to all forms of\nauthoritarianism as by the persecution that many of its philosophers\nsuffered at the hands of dictators and authoritarian political\nfigures. In its early years question of democracy, legitimacy and\nlegality were subordinate to the metaphysical and ontological\nquestions of the subject of historical emancipation. However, over the\nlast two decades, the political future of Latin American has become a\nmore pressing issue. The quest for national sovereignty and liberation\nfrom Euroamerican imperialism is now framed in terms of ethnoracial\ndemocracies and the greater participation of sectors of the Latin\nAmerican people that were either excluded or entirely ignored during\nthe processes of national independence and national-state formation.\nIn the first decades of the twenty-first century, philosophers of\nliberation think of themselves as contributing to the elaboration of\nwhat has been called \u201cmulticultural\u201d democracy, and in\nthis way, more historically inflected and less\n\u201contological\u201d notions of \u201cel pueblo\u201d\nare being embraced and developed.\n\nTo close, like most vibrant and still alive currents in world\nphilosophy, the philosophy of liberation has been contributing to\nthree key issues that are vital to all philosophy in general, namely:\nthe question of meaning, i.e., how we produce, reproduce and transmit\nhistorically produced meanings across a variety of semiological and\nhermeneutical practices. This is the general question of how humans\ncontinue to communicate across time, even when their basic conditions\nof the production of world-views has radically altered. In tandem, the\nphilosophy of liberation, which began partly as a challenge to a\ncertain historiography of ideas in Latin America, continues to raise\nthe question of how we write the history of philosophy, for whom and\nfor what purposes, in such a way that we surrender to neither\nideological distortions nor na\u00efve purisms, neither Eurocentrism\nnor thirdworldism. Finally, like all transformative and enduring\nphilosophical movements, the philosophy of liberation has since its\ninception articulated itself as a metaphilosophical reflection, i.e.,\nas a philosophy that reflects on its own practice and what merits the\ndignity of being called philosophy tout court (Vallega\n2014).\n",
