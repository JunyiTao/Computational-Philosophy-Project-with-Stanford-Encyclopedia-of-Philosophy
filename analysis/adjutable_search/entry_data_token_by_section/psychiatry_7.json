    "main_text": "Explanation || From Histories to Causes\n3.3 From Histories to Causes\n\n\nCooper distinguishes natural-history based explanations from case\nstudies. She presents them as distinct kinds of psychiatric\nexplanation, but she doesn\u2019t go into detail about what the other\ntypes might be, so her overall position is hard to grasp. But one idea\nis very clear; at least some mental illnesses are natural kinds, and\nnatural history explanations work by \u201cinvoking natural\nkinds\u201d (2007, 47). Once we know which kind an object belongs\nto, we can explain and predict its behaviour based on its kind\nmembership: we can say why a substance has expanded upon being heated\nby invoking the fact that it\u2019s a bit of metal, and metals expand\nwhen heated. Or we can predict that if Rex is in the kitchen then\nleaving the roast beef there unattended is a bad idea, since Rex is a\ndog and dog-meat interactions take a predictable form. And, it is\nhoped, we can explain why Laura hears voices by appealing to the fact\nthat she has schizophrenia. And our confidence that she is\nschizophrenic warrants (pessimistic) predictions about her future.\n\n\nCooper also talks about case histories and argues that they explain\nanother person\u2019s unique situation by drawing on our capacities\nfor simulation of other people\u2019s states of mind. This claim\ninvolves commitments in the explanation of theory of mind that would\ntake this essay too far astray. The relation of folk psychology to case\nhistories is unexplored, as is the nature of reasoning from cases more\ngenerally: we lack a good general account of what a case history\nexplains or is otherwise good for, in psychiatry or in any other field.\n(Forrester (1996) points out that reasoning with cases seems to be a\ndistinctive and ubiquitous style of thought in science and elsewhere,\nand we have no good account of it.) So for now, we must put case\nhistories aside.\n\n\nCooper argues that a natural history explanation needs to cite\nnatural kinds if it is to be helpful. But in order to work the\nexplanations do not need to cite the actual causal mechanisms\nresponsible for the behaviour of the members of the kind in question.\nWe know that Rex will devour the roast if we leave him in the kitchen\nwith it, and we can safely make this prediction despite total ignorance\nof canine physiology. The history of psychiatry offers a number of\ninstances in which pharmacology has led to the recognition of new kinds\neven in the absence of detailed causal knowledge. For example\nCade\u2019s (1949) discovery that lithium greatly inhibited the\nstartle reflex and other forms of anxiety in guinea pigs was useful\neven without good information about their underlying cognitive\nneurobiology, since it led him to predict that whatever was going on\nmight also apply in humans.\n\n\nInvoking kinds give us power over the world, by making it easier to\npredict, control or mitigate the outcomes we care about. One\nphilosophical question we can ask, of course, is whether science wants\nanything more. If you think science just aims for empirical adequacy,\nthen it may seem that sorting patients into kinds is enough, provided\nthat we can understand the course of the disease.\n\n\nIn particular, natural history explanations fit a conception of\ndiseases as syndromes unfolding over time that is enshrined in both\nDSM-IV-TR and the minimal construal of the medical model. It does not\ndeny that there are causal processes, but sees mental illnesses as\ncollections of signs and symptoms with characteristic histories. They\ndoubtless depend on physical processes but are not defined or\nclassified in physical terms. This picture of disease naturally goes\nalong with the employment of natural history explanations, since they\ntoo invoke natural kinds without worrying about the mechanisms that\nexplain the behaviour of members of the kind. It\u2019s enough to be\nable to identify kind membership, thereby giving us a degree of\nexplanatory and predictive control.\n\nNatural history explanations fit Thagard\u2019s disease network\nnicely; if a disease network provides a narrative account of why people\nget ill, and predicts some outcomes, we can see it as a graphical\nrepresentation of the historical pathway typical of a kind. Much\nepidemiological work in psychiatry fits the pattern here; we try to\nisolate the causal factors that define a disease history that is met\nwith regularly. These histories display relations between variables\nthat show how later phenomena, like the symptoms of depression or\nsubstance abuse, depend on earlier phenomena, like the genes you were\nborn with, or the parental abuse you endured.\n\n\nUnlike some of the more homespun examples, the natural histories\nuncovered by systematic longitudinal research can be quite surprising\nand genuinely explanatory. But (as Cooper and Thagard both suggest)\nthey leave us with a lot to do; whatever the philosophers of science\nmay say about how empirical adequacy is good enough, physicians have\nspent a century and a half looking for causal explanations of\npathological phenomena (Carter 2003).\n",
