    "main_text": "Spectrum Inversion in an Argument\u2026 || \u2026For the Ineffability of Qualia\n3.8 \u2026For the Ineffability of Qualia\n\n\nThe introduction of \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(Q_{G}\\)\u2019, and so forth, at the\nstart of this article might have occasioned some suspicion. Assume\nthat spectrum inversion does not occur, and consider a\ncounterfactual situation in which, as Block puts it,\n\u201cspectrum inversion is rife\u201d (1990, 55). Suppose\nthat philosophers in this counterfactual situation introduced qualia\nterminology in the way it was introduced in section 1. If their qualia\nterminology is meaningless, then it is hard to see why our terminology\nis better off\u2014we use\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019 just as it is used in\nthe counterfactual situation. If, on the other hand, their qualia\nterminology is meaningful, then presumably\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as they use it, refers\nto something other than a quale. (Since spectrum inversion is rife,\ntheir use of \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019 is not\nassociated with any particular quale.) Again, given the overlap in\nuse, why suppose that our word\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019 is any different? Either\nway: \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019 does not refer to a\nquale. There is a threat, then, that qualia cannot be named in a\npublic language\u2014that they are ineffable (cf. Dennett\n1988, 228\u20139). Indeed, that seems to be Block\u2019s opinion: \u201cif an\ninverted spectrum is possible, then experiential contents that can be\nexpressed in public language (for example, looking red) are\nnot qualitative contents, but rather intentional contents\u201d\n(1990, 55; see also Block 2007, 73\u20134). (\u201cQualitative\ncontents\u201d are qualia that are not representational properties:\nsee subsection 3.2.)\n\n\nFrege held a version of the ineffability view. One of his theses in\nThe Foundations of Arithmetic is that arithmetic is\n\u201cobjective\u201d, which he explains as follows:\nWhat is objective\u2026is what is subject to laws, what\ncan be conceived and judged, what is expressible in words. What is\npurely intuitable is not communicable. To make this clear, let us\nsuppose two rational beings such that projective properties and\nrelations are all they can intuit\u2014the lying of three points on\na line, of four points on a plane, and so on; and let what the one\nintuits as plane appear to the other as a point, and vice versa, so\nthat what for the one is the line joining two points for the other is\nthe line of intersection of two planes, and so on with the one\nintuition always dual to the other. In these circumstances they could\nunderstand one another quite well and would never realize the\ndifference between their intuitions, since in projective geometry every\nproposition has its dual counterpart; any disagreements over points of\naesthetic appreciation would not be conclusive evidence. Over all\ngeometrical theorems they would be in complete agreement, only\ninterpreting the words in terms of their respective intuitions. With\nthe word \u2018point\u2019, for example, one would connect one\nintuition and the other another. We can therefore still say that this\nword has for them an objective meaning, provided only that by this\nmeaning we do not understand any of the peculiarities of their\nrespective intuitions. (1884/1953, \u00a726)\n\n\nThis is an inverted spatial qualia scenario. According to Frege, the\ninversion would not show up in the semantics of words: both Nonvert and\nInvert use the word \u2018point\u2019 with the same meaning, despite\nassociating very different \u201cintuitions\u201d with it. In the\nnext paragraph, Frege makes a similar claim about color\nterminology.\nThe word \u2018white\u2019 ordinarily makes us think of a\ncertain sensation, which is, of course, entirely subjective; but even\nin ordinary everyday speech, it often bears, I think, an objective\nsense. When we call snow white, we mean to refer to an objective\nquality which we recognize, in ordinary daylight, by a certain\nsensation. If the snow is being seen in a coloured light, we take that\ninto account in our judgement and say, for instance, \u2018It\nappears red at present, but it \\(is\\) white.\u2019 Even\na colour-blind man can speak of red and green, in spite of the fact\nthat he does not distinguish between these colors in his sensations; he\nrecognizes the distinction by the fact that others make it, or perhaps\nby making a physical experiment. Often, therefore, a colour word does\nnot signify our subjective sensation, which we cannot know to agree\nwith anyone else\u2019s (for obviously calling things by the same name does\nnot guarantee as much), but rather an objective quality.\n(\u00a726)\n\n\nAlthough Frege seems to concede that sometimes a color word\n\u201csignifies our subjective sensation\u201d, the general drift of\nthe argument points to a much stronger conclusion, that our subjective\nsensations are simply not \u201cexpressible in words\u201d. A related\nexample is Wittgenstein\u2019s \u201cbeetle in the box\u201d:\nSuppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it\na \u2018beetle\u2019. No one can look into anyone else\u2019s box, and\neveryone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his\nbeetle.\u2014Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have\nsomething different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing\nconstantly changing.\u2014But suppose the word \u2018beetle\u2019\nhad a use in these people\u2019s language?\u2014If so it would not be\nused as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the\nlanguage game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even\nbe empty. No, one can \u2018divide through\u2019 by the thing in the\nbox; it cancels out, whatever it is. (1958, \u00a7293)\n\n\n(Notice that Wittgenstein imagines \u201cabsent beetles\u201d,\ncorresponding to an \u201cabsent qualia\u201d scenario.)\n\n\nHere is one argument suggested by these passages.\n\n\nSuppose that Humbert is semantically (and otherwise) competent, has\nnormal color vision, is a member of our linguistic community, and uses\nqualia terminology (\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(Q_{G}\\)\u2019, etc.), as introduced in\nsection 1 above. Further suppose that spectrum inversion does not in\nfact occur.\n\n\nNow consider a counterfactual spectrum inversion scenario in which\n\u201cspectrum inversion is rife\u201d. Invert has been spectrally\ninverted with respect to some other members of his community since\nbirth, all of whom use color terminology in much the same way. Nonvert\nis spectrally inverted with respect to his neighbor Invert, but\u2014comparing \nthis scenario with the actual scenario described in the\nprevious paragraph\u2014is not spectrally inverted with respect to\nHumbert. Further suppose that Nonvert and his neighbor Invert use\nqualia terminology as introduced in section 1 above. Assume as a\nsuppressed premise that this scenario is possible.\n\n\nLet \u2018\\(X\\)\u2019 abbreviate the definite description \u2018the quale\ndistinctive of Humbert\u2019s experiences of red things\u2019 (by hypothesis,\nthis definite description is coextensive with \u2018the quale\ndistinctive of Nonvert\u2019s experiences of red things in the\ncounterfactual inversion scenario\u2019).\n\nArgument E\n\nP1.\n\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Invert uses\nit, and \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Nonvert uses\nit, refer (if at all) to the same property.\nP2.\n\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Invert uses\nit, does not refer to \\(X\\).\nHence:\n\nC1.\n\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Nonvert uses\nit, does not refer to \\(X\\).\nP3.\n\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Humbert uses\nit, and \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Nonvert uses\nit, refer (if at all) to the same property.\n\nHence, from C1 and P3:\n\nC2.\n\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as Humbert uses\nit, does not refer to \\(X\\).\n\n\n\nSince the rest of us are in no better position than Humbert, C2\nleads inevitably to the conclusion that\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(Q_{G}\\)\u2019, etc., as introduced in\nthe manner of section 1, do not in fact refer to qualia. One might view\nArgument E as showing that certain salient aspects of our mental lives\nare linguistically elusive (as Frege apparently did); alternatively,\none might follow Wittgenstein and conclude that the very idea of qualia\nrests on a conceptual confusion.\n\n\nIn fact, C2 does not imply that qualia are completely\nunspeakable\u2014it does not, that is, imply that \\(no\\)\nexpression refers to \\(X\\) (i.e., the quale distinctive of\nHumbert\u2019s experiences of red things). Indeed, if the sentence to the\nright of \u2018C2\u2019 succeeds in expressing a truth, then\n\u2018\\(X\\)\u2019 (and so \u2018the quale distinctive of Humbert\u2019s\nexperiences of red things\u2019) refers to \\(X\\). If Argument E\nis as far as we can go, then the moral seems to be that particular\nqualia can only be picked out \u2018by description\u2019\u2014they\ncannot be referred to by semantically simple expressions, such as\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019 and\n \u2018\\(Q_{G}\\)\u2019.[45]\n But\u2014bearing\nin mind Wittgenstein\u2019s remark that \u201cthe box might even be\nempty\u201d\u2014one might attempt to extend the argument to show\nthat even the word \u2018qualia\u2019 itself is devoid of\nsignificance.\n\n\nHowever, Argument E is not obviously sound. The premise in need of\nmost defense is\n P3.[46]\n When qualia terminology was introduced in\nsection 1, it was tacitly presupposed that spectrum inversion was\nnot rife. In Invert\u2019s and Nonvert\u2019s community, that\npresupposition is false, and so it should not be surprising if the\nattempt to introduce \u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019 into\ntheir public language fails. But in Humbert\u2019s community the\npresupposition is true; so why wouldn\u2019t\n\u2018\\(Q_{R}\\)\u2019, as the members of this\ncommunity use it, successfully refer to the quale distinctive of\nHumbert\u2019s experiences of red\n things?[47]\n",
