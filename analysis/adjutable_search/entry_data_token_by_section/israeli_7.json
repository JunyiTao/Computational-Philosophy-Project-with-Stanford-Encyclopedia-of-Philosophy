    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The Sequence of Emanation\n3.6 The Sequence of Emanation\n\nWhereas for Plotinus, the second being in the emanative chain is\nNous (Intellect), Israeli concurs with the model in\n\u201cIbn Hasday\u2019s Neoplatonist\u201d, that First Matter and\nFirst Form are the first and only \u201ccreations\u201d of the\nCreator\u2014that is, produced by an act of Will\u2014and precede\nthe Intellect. First Matter and First Form conjoin to form the First\nIntellect. After God creates First Matter and First Form, God\u2019s\nactive role in creation ceases and all subsequent beings emanate in a\nchain of hypostases from Intellect, downward to the three kinds of\nsoul, and culminating in the material and corporeal Sphere/Nature.\nFurther, Israeli adds a second Intellect which is a distinct\nhypostasis from First Intellect. First Intellect contains the totality\nof forms and knows itself intuitively with perfect unchanging\nknowledge. Second Intellect exists within the domain of Soul, and\nknows the actualization of particular things via temporal\nknowledge.\n\nSoul is the next realm in the emanative sequence, and Israeli here\nreplicates Aristotle\u2019s threefold division. This universal soul\nis made up of the higher Rational Soul, the Animal Soul and the\nVegetative/Nutritive Soul and from these emanates the superlunary\nsphere of heaven\u2014the point where the material world emerges from\nSoul. Whereas most other Neoplatonists use the term\n\u201cNature\u201d for the corporeal world, Israeli uses the term\n\u201cthe sphere.\u201d The motions of the superlunary sphere of\nheaven, made up of a fifth unchanging element, govern the combinations\nand recombinations of the four elements in the material world below\nthe moon\u2014hence they govern the processes of generation and\ncorruption. Israeli\u2019s student Dunash Ibn Tamim calls this fourth\nsoul the soul of the sphere.\n",
