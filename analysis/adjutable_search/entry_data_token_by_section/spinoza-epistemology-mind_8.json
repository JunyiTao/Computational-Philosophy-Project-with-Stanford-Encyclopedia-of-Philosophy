    "main_text": "Epistemology || Truth and adequacy\n3.1 Truth and adequacy\n\nSpinoza is often taken to endorse the correspondence theory of truth,\nthat is, roughly, the view that truth consists in some sort of\nconformity of thought to reality. Spinoza himself puts the point in\nterms of \u201cagreement\u201d: \u201cA true idea must agree with\n[convenire] its object\u201d (E1ax6).\n\nHowever, this relational property of \u201cagreement\u201d is not\nthe only way Spinoza characterizes truth. True Spinozistic ideas also\nhave an intrinsic and, arguably, introspectable (cf. Garrett\n2018: ch.5) property which distinguishes them as true without\nrequiring us to look beyond the ideas themselves. An\n\u201cadequate\u201d idea is one with this intrinsic property:\n\nBy adequate idea I understand an idea which, insofar as it is\nconsidered in itself, without relation to an object, has all the\nproperties, or intrinsic denominations of a true idea. Exp.:\nsay intrinsic to exclude what is extrinsic, viz. the agreement of the\nidea with its object. (E2def4)\n\n\nConsequently, truth can be \u201cits own standard\u201d, such that\n\u201che who has a true idea at the same time knows that he has a\ntrue idea, and cannot doubt the truth of the thing\u201d (E2p43, cf.\nTIE \u00a736).\n\nThe view is surely puzzling: How is it that just by considering an\nidea on its own, we can be certain that it in fact conforms to what it\nrepresents? What might these intrinsic signs of truth be?\n\nOne plausible answer is that Spinoza has in mind here something like\nclarity and distinctness (cf. e.g. E2p38c), and so is in broad\nagreement with Descartes\u2019s \u201crule\u201d that true ideas\ncan appear to us as clear and distinct. Don Garrett has suggested\nthat, in addition to clarity and distinctness, we should understand\nadequacy as the \u201clogical consistency of the represented\nobject\u201d (2018: ch.6). On this reading, true ideas are\nself-evidently true insofar as we can clearly and distinctly perceive\nthe logical consistency of what they represent. This proposal has the\nvirtue of tying together Spinoza\u2019s two characterizations of\ntruth \u2013 the extrinsic and the intrinsic one \u2013 into one\nneat package: given Spinoza\u2019s commitment to necessitarianism\n(E1p33, E1p35), any logically consistent idea will represent not just\na possible object but a necessary and actual one; hence we can know\nfrom the logical consistency of an idea alone that it in fact\ncorresponds to its object.\n\nThe above definition of adequate idea in terms of a true idea\u2019s\nintrinsic or nonrelational properties is, however, not the only way\nSpinoza characterizes mental \u201cadequacy\u201d. He also gives\nwhat we could call a mind-relative account of adequacy. It is\nmade possible by his belief that finite minds are \u201cparts\u201d\nof the omniscient \u201cinfinite intellect\u201d (see 2.1.2). As he\nexplains, \u201cthere are no inadequate or confused ideas except\ninsofar as they are related to the singular mind of someone\u201d\n(E2p36d):\n\nwhen we say that God has this or that idea, not only insofar as he\nconstitutes the nature of the human Mind, but insofar as he also has\nthe idea of another thing together with the human Mind, then we say\nthat the human Mind perceives the thing only partially, or\ninadequately (E2p11c)\n\n\nIn other words, if ideas constituting a given finite mind suffice for\nrepresenting x in the same way that a perfect\nintellect would represent x, the mind in question represents\nx \u201cadequately\u201d. Eugene Marshall has usefully\nexpressed this point in terms of part-whole \u201ccontainment\u201d:\nideas are adequate iff they are entirely a part of, i.e., contained in,\nthe relevant finite mind (2013:26).\n\nHere is an example of how this might work. Consider once again\nSpinoza\u2019s claim that the idea of the body that essentially\nconstitutes a human mind is \u201ccompletely confused\u201d (see\n2.2.1). We can put this point in terms of inadequacy: a human\nmind knows its body as a particular in duration only by perceiving how\nit is \u201caffected\u201d or changed. This idea of the body is\n\u201cinadequate\u201d in Spinoza\u2019s technical sense because\nGod\u2019s conception of that body includes many components that are\nnot also part of the human mind\u2019s conception of it: God\nconceives of all the many bodies that go into composing, preserving,\nand \u201cregenerating\u201d the affected human body, as well as of\nall the affecting external bodies, and of the infinite series of\ncauses on which these bodies in turn depend (E2p19d).\n\nConfronted with Spinoza\u2019s account of mental adequacy, we might\nwonder how his two characterizations of this concept are supposed to\nhang together: why should an idea entirely contained in a mind also\nhave certain intrinsic markings of truth, such as clarity and\ndistinctness? One way to reconcile these two claims is to infer that\nfor Spinoza only ideas whose \u201cpremises\u201d, so to speak, are\nwholly contained in a given mind can also appear as manifestly or\nself-evidently true. (One might also wonder if finite minds like ours\ncan ever manage to think anything truly \u201cadequately\u201d, if\nthis requires that all of the \u201cpremises\u201d of a\ngiven idea be contained in our minds [cf. Della Rocca 1996]. We come\nback to this question in 3.2.1.)\n\nFinally, some commentators have concluded, further, that an\n\u201cadequate\u201d idea must be contained in a mind insofar as it\nmust also have been \u201cadequately caused\u201d \u2013 i.e.,\nself-sufficiently or autonomously caused \u2013 by the mind in\nquestion, and as such counts as a true \u201caction\u201d of that\nmind, in Spinoza\u2019s technical sense of these terms\n(E3def1\u20132). If that\u2019s right, then adequate ideas must all\nbe innate (LeBuffe 2010, E. Marshall 2013, J. Steinberg\n2018a: ch.8). For having a cause external to the mind \u2013 for\nexample, arising from experience \u2013 would be incompatible by\ndefinition with having been \u201cadequately caused\u201d. On such\nreadings, what we might experience as an acquisition of an\nadequate idea (say, in a philosophy class) is in fact only a matter of\nbecoming more conscious of it (J. Steinberg 2018a: ch.8; see\n2.3).\n\n(See also Kisner 2011.)\n",
