Historically, the two most common reasons\ngiven for women's default exclusion were their purportedly more\ncomplicated and variable hormonal patterns and the possibility that\nthey might be or become pregnant during the study, which could harm\nthe fetus (DeBruin 1994, Little 1996, Giacomini and Baylis 2003). The\nNational Institutes of Health solicited a report from the Institute of\nMedicine in 1992 on the effects upon women's health of these routine\nexclusions, and the report concluded that serious harms were being\ndone to women. Women were disproportionately denied the direct\nbenefits that might come from study participation. More importantly,\ntheir systematic exclusion from clinical trials meant that we did not\nknow how to design appropriate treatment plans for women, whose\ndifferent hormones and reproductive system, longer life span, and\nother medically relevant differences meant that treating them as\nsmallish men for the purposes of dosing drugs and other treatment\ndecisions was not a medically sound strategy. In 1993, the NIH changed\nits policies to make inclusion of women the default in all research,\nvariation from which requires explicit justification. Constance Holden\n(2008) reported that as of 2006, women comprised 68.9% of participants\nin clinical trials. However, some argue that women continue to be\nsignificantly outnumbered by male subjects in biomedical research and\nclinical trials generally; these commentators suggest that women's\ninclusion rates were artificially inflated by a small number of single\nsex studies (Kim, Tingen, and Woodruff 2010). Moreover, disclosure of\ninclusion practices and rates in clinical trials is unreliable, and\nrecent reviews fail to confirm reports of significant progress in\ndiverse inclusion (Woodruff et al. 2015, Geller et al. 2011). \n\nIn any case, pregnant women remain an official \u2018vulnerable\ngroup\u2019 under the federal policies governing human subjects\nresearch, and are exempt from the inclusion mandate. Indeed, virtually\nall clinical research excludes pregnant women out of purported concern\nfor teratogenic effects on fetuses, while even trials for\ninterventions not classified as potentially teratogenic routinely\nexclude pregnant women (Shields and Lyerly 2013). Ongoing exclusion\nstymies development of safe and effective medical interventions for\npregnant women, whose metabolism, blood volume, hormones, immune\nsystem, and other bodily systems are affected by pregnancy in ways\nthat impact their response to medication (Blehar et al. 2013). It also\nplaces fetuses at risk; out of the 468 medications approved in the\nUnited States in 2002, 91% pose an unknown risk to fetuses (Lyerly,\nLittle, and Faden 2008b). While the lacuna of reliable evidence\nregarding safe and effective medical interventions for pregnant women\nand their fetuses is widely acknowledged as a problem, it has not, in\ngeneral, shaken the consensus that it is unethical to put fetuses at\nunknown risk for the purposes of research. Often the thalidomide\ncrisis of the 1970s is cited as an example of the potential dangers of\nexposing fetuses to drugs, and hence as an object lesson in the need\nfor precautionary principle to govern our practices of including\npregnant women in research. But if the welfare of fetuses is our\nprimary concern, we ought to take the opposite lesson from the\nthalidomide disaster: it is precisely because thalidomide was\nnot systematically tested before being prescribed that so\nmany babies were affected (Ibid.).\n\nIn light of our lack of knowledge of the teratogenic effects of most\ndrugs, advice for pregnant women is generally conservative; women are\nadvised to avoid medical interventions and medications during\npregnancy if at all possible. For example, women with mental illnesses\nsuch as bipolar disorder and depression are often counseled to avoid\nmedication during pregnancy, both because psychotropic drugs tend to\ndiffuse readily across the placenta, and because typically, the mental\nstate of the mother does not directly impact the health of\nthe fetus (in contrast with, for instance, diabetes or\nlife-threatening cancer). However, mental illness in pregnant women\nmatters to fetal development: untreated depression, for example, is\nassociated with premature birth, low birthweight, and other\ncomplications (Gold and Marcus 2008). Moreover, some researchers argue\nthat evidence for negative health outcomes for children born from\nwomen taking anti-depressants is scant and unreliable, and provides\nlittle guidance for treatment (Byatt, Deligiannidis, and Freeman 2013,\nPearlstein 2015). Without improved evidence, it is difficult to give\nany rules of thumb for the ethics of treating mental illness during\npregnancy.\n\nMore generally, the conservative approach to doing research with and\ntreating women during pregnancy emphasizes the risks to fetuses from\nintervening, but not the risks from not intervening (Lyerly, Little,\nand Faden 2008b). When we exclude pregnant women from research or\ndiscourage treatment because of a lack of knowledge about the effects\nof a medication, we are not typically erring on the side of fetal\nsafety; rather, we generally have no idea whether it is\nriskier for the fetus to be exposed to a medication or to the effects\nof untreated maternal morbidity. As Lyerly, Little and Faden point\nout, \u201cIf research is important to tell us when medications are\nunsafe, it is also important to reassure us when drugs are\nsafe \u2026 In the absence of information about the safety and\nefficacy of medications, pregnant women and their providers are left\nwith two unsavory options\u2014take a drug, with unknown safety and\nefficacy; or fail to treat the conditions, thus leaving the woman and\nfetus vulnerable to the consequences of the underlying medical\nproblems\u201d (Lyerly, Little and Faden 2008b, 12, 19). Pregnant\nwomen who have medical needs during pregnancy are typically told to\nweigh the risks and benefits when deciding whether to proceed with a\ntreatment whose impact on fetuses is unknown. But this is an\nimpossible demand; no one can weigh unknown risks and benefits.\nExcluding pregnant women from research sustains the impossibility of\nthis calculation, and erring on the side of nontreatment may or may\nnot best protect fetal well-being.\n\nTo our knowledge, no bioethicist has defended the current policy of\nnear-universal exclusion of pregnant women from research. It is\nunclear, however, how best to craft appropriate standards for\ninclusion. Not only is the random exposure of fetuses to unknown\nteratogenic risks ethically problematic, but few pregnant women are\nlikely to enroll in such trials. Some bioethicists propose ethical\nguidelines for inclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials that\nattend to both the woman and her fetus as patients (Chevernak and\nMcCullough 2011). As others point out in response, however, the fetus\nas patient approach will likely entail continuing strict limitations\non clinical trial participation, including in cases where the\nintervention in question is potentially life-saving for the pregnant\nwoman but risky to the fetus. The approach does not resolve the\nproblem of pregnant women's exclusion from medical research\nparticipation and associated health impacts (Baylis and Kaposy 2011,\nLiaschenko, Debruin, and Marshall 2011, Perry 2011). We are in need of\nnew practices and policies that are sensitive to the difficulties and\ndangers of research on pregnant women, but are undistorted by\nassumptions that it is always more responsible and safer to protect\nfetuses from unknown interventions. Proposals for identifying and\nimplementing ethically and medically sound guidelines for including\npregnant women in clinical trials are currently under development\n(e.g. Brandon et al. 2014, White 2015).\n\nIn rare cases, such as some advanced cancers, treatment decisions for\na pregnant woman necessitate a choice between saving her life and that\nof the fetus, or other dramatic trade-offs. In such cases, there is\ngeneral consensus (especially in the wake of the Angela Carder case\ndiscussed above) that the primary consideration should be saving the\nlife of the mother (i.e. see Puls, Terry, and Hunter 1997). Charles\nWeijer (1998) points out, however, that in some cases a pregnant\nwoman's decision to refuse treatment and sacrifice herself for her\nchild should be counted as an autonomous decision worth respecting,\nand that we should not assume that only self-interested decisions can\nbe autonomous.\n",
