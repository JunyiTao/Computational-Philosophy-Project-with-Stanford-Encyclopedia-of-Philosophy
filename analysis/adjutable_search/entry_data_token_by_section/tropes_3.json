    "main_text": "The Nature of Tropes || Complex or Simple?\n2.2 Complex or Simple?\n\nAccording to most trope-theorists, tropes are ontologically simple.\nHere this should be taken to mean that tropes have no constituents, in\nthe sense that they are not \u2018made up\u2019 or\n\u2018built\u2019 from entities belonging to some other\ncategory. Simple tropes, thus understood, can still have\nparts\u2014even necessarily so\u2014as long as those parts are also\ntropes (cf. e.g., Giberman 2022; Robb 2005:\n 469).[8],[9]\n\nThat tropes are ontologically simple arguably provides the trope\ntheorist with a tie-breaker vis-\u00e0-vis states of affairs (if\nstates of affairs are understood as substrates instantiating\nuniversals). Prima facie a theory positing states of affairs\nhas the same explanatory power as a theory positing tropes. But a\ntheory of states of affairs posits\u2014apart from the state of\naffairs itself\u2014at least two (fundamental) sorts of things\n(universals and substrates), whereas a theory of tropes (at least a\ntheory of tropes according to which tropes are simple and objects are\nbundles of tropes) posits only one (tropes). From the point of view of\nontological parsimony, therefore, the trope view ought to be\n preferred.[10]\n\nCan the trope be simple? According to a number of the\ntheory\u2019s critics, it cannot. Here is Herbert Hochberg\u2019s\nargument to that effect (2004: 39; cf. also his 2001:\n178\u2013179; for versions of the argument cf. also\nBrownstein 1973: 47; Moreland 2001; Armstrong 2004; Ehring\n 2011):[11]\n\n\nLet a basic proposition be one that is either atomic or the negation\nof an atomic proposition. Then consider tropes t and\nt* where \u2018t is different from\nt*\u2019 and \u2018t is exactly similar to\nt*\u2019 are both true. Assume you take either\n\u2018diversity\u2019 or \u2018identity\u2019 as primitive. Then\nboth propositions are basic propositions. But they are logically\nindependent. Hence, they cannot have the same truth makers. Yet,\nfor\u2026trope theory /\u2026/ they do and must have the same\ntruth makers. Thus the theory fails.\n\n\nA number of different things can be said in response to this argument.\nIt assumes, first, that if tropes are simple, trope theory must\nviolate what appears to be a truly fundamental principle (call it HP,\nshort for \u2018Hochberg\u2019s principle\u2019): that\nlogically independent basic propositions must have distinct\ntruthmakers. Having to reject HP is hence a cost of having simple\ntropes. Perhaps this cost is acceptable. That it is, seems to be a\nview held by Mulligan et al. (a similar view is, according to\nArmstrong 2005: 310 also held by Robb). For, they claim (1984:\n296):\n\n\n\u2026[w]e conceive it as in principle possible that one and the\nsame truth-maker may make true sentences with different meanings: this\nhappens anyway if we take non-atomic sentences into account, and no\narguments occur to us which suggest that this cannot happen for atomic\nsentences as well.\n\n\nOne reason for rejecting HP has been put forward by Fraser MacBride\n(2004). HP, he notes, is formulated in terms of\n\u2018logically independent basic propositions\u2019.\nHowever, HP is only plausible if it takes more than logical (what\nMacBride calls \u2018formal\u2019) (in)dependence into account:\nmaterial independent also\n matters![12]\n Only if two propositions are logically and materially\nindependent does it follow that they must have distinct truthmakers.\nBut formal and material independence can\u2014and in this case most\nlikely will\u2014come apart. For (ibid: 190):\n\n\n\u2026[i]nsofar as truth-makers are conceived as inhabitants of the\nworld, as creatures that exist independently of language, it is far\nfrom evident that logically independent statements in the formal sense\nare compelled to correspond to distinct truth-makers.\n\n\nAnother argument against the simplicity of tropes comes from Ehring\nand was inspired by an argument first delivered by Moreland (2001:\n64). J. P. Moreland\u2019s argument concludes that trope theory is\nunintelligible. Ehring thinks this is much too strong. This is\ntherefore the formulation of the objection he prefers (2011: 180):\n\n\nThe nature and particularity of a trope are intrinsically grounded in\nthat trope. If tropes are simple, their nature and their particularity\nare hence identical. The natures of a red trope and an orange trope\nare inexactly similar. Hence their respective particularities should\nbe inexactly similar as well. However, these particularities are\nexactly similar. Hence, their particularities are not\nidentical to their natures, and tropes are not simple.\n\n\nHere the trope theorist could probably reply that the objection rests\non a kind of category mistake: that \u2018particularities\u2019 are\nquite simply not things amenable to standing in similarity relations.\nAlternatively, she might just concede that tropes are complex, yet\nargue that they are so in the innocent sense of having other tropes as\nparts (one particularity-trope and a distinct nature-trope). Against\nthis, Ehring (2011: 183f) has argued that if the trope has its\nparticularity reside in one of the tropes that make it up, we can\nalways ask about that trope what grounds its\nparticularity and nature respectively. Which would seem to lead us\ninto an infinite\u2014and most probably vicious\u2014regress.\n\nEhring\u2019s own solution to the problem is to adopt a version of\nthe trope view (what he calls Natural Class Trope Nominalism) on which\ntropes do not resemble each other in virtue of their nature, but\nrather in virtue of belonging to this or that natural class. On this\nview, what makes two tropes qualitatively the same (their belonging to\nthe same natural class of tropes) is different from what makes them\ndistinct (the tropes themselves, primitively being what they are).\nWhich means that, that tropes can be distinct yet exactly resemble\neach other is no longer a reason to think that tropes are complex.\n\nA different kind of solution has recently been proposed by Giberman\n(2022, cf. also his 2014). According to him, because\nat least some of the tropes there are, are spatiotemporally located\n(they are what he calls\n \u2018concrete\u2019)[13],\n they must have size, shape, and duration. That tropes have these\ndifferent features means that they are capable of multiple\nresemblances. Which, claims Giberman, means that they are\nqualitatively complex. Yet that they are does not threaten the trope\nview in any way. For, according to Giberman, tropes are (qualitatively\ncomplex) ostriches. What this means is that tropes are such\nthat they \u201cprimitively account for their own multiple\nresemblance capacities\u201d. Which means that \u201cno (further)\nontological machinery is required to explain that an ostrich trope has\nmultiple properties\u201d (even though we are admitting that it\ndoes!) (Giberman 2022: 18). In this sense, the trope is like the\nQuinean concrete particular (Giberman ibid.; cf. also Quine\n1948, Devitt 1980):\n\n\nWhen the Quinean is asked what it is about a given electron that\nmetaphysically explains its ability to resemble both massive things\nand charged things, he will likely answer \u2018nothing!\u2014it\njust is that way\u2019... Similarly, when asked what it is about the\nn charge trope that metaphysically explains its ability to\nresemble both charged things and things of a certain size, the ostrich\ntrope theorist answers: \u2018the trope itself\u2014no more\nstructure to it than that\u2019.\n\n\nBut then, on Giberman\u2019s view\u2014and pace\nEhring\u2014we are not allowed to ask of the properties of\nthe trope what grounds their particularity and nature\n(that\u2019s primitive!). And if asking this is not allowed, is the\nidea, no infinite regress can be generated (cf. also fn 20,\nthis entry).\n\nWhat about the advantage the trope view was supposed to have over the\nstate-of-affairs view? Primitive or not, if the complexity is there,\ndoesn\u2019t this mean that those views are now on a par\nparsimony-wise? Giberman doesn\u2019t think so, and gives two reasons\nwhy not: (1) although the ostrich trope is qualitatively complex, it\nis not\u2014unlike the state of affairs\u2014categorially\ncomplex (no trope has a constituent from outside the category\ntrope) (2022: 16); (2) (more contentiously) even states of\naffairs, in being spatiotemporal, need to have size and shape etc. But\nthen, apart from having to accept the existence of categorially\ndistinct substrates, the state of affairs theorist must also accept\nthat universals\u2014like tropes\u2014are primitively qualitatively\ncomplex (ibid: 18).\n",
