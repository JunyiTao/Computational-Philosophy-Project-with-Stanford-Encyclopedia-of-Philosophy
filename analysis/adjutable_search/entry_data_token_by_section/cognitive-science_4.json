    "main_text": "Theoretical Approaches || Formal logic\n4.1 Formal logic\n\nFormal logic\n provides some powerful tools for looking at the nature of\nrepresentation and computation. Propositional and predicate calculus\nserve to express many complex kinds of knowledge, and many inferences\ncan be understood in terms of logical deduction with inferences rules\nsuch as modus ponens. The explanation schema for the logical approach\nis:\n\nExplanation target:\n\nWhy do people make the inferences they do?\n Explanatory pattern:\n\nPeople have mental representations similar to sentences in\npredicate logic.\nPeople have deductive and inductive procedures that operate on\nthose sentences.\nThe deductive and inductive procedures, applied to the sentences,\nproduce the inferences.\n\n\n\nIt is not certain, however, that logic provides the core ideas about\nrepresentation and computation needed for cognitive science, since\nmore efficient and psychologically natural methods of computation may\nbe needed to explain human thinking. (See the entry on\n logic and artificial intelligence.)\n",
