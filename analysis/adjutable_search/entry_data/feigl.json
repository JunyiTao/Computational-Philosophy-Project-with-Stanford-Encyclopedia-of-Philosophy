    "main_text": "\n1. Biography\n\nHerbert Feigl was born on December 14, 1902, in the then Austrian town\nof Reichenberg (nowadays Liberec, Czech Republic). Feigl\u2019s\nparents were Jewish, but not religious. His father, a trained weaver,\nwas said to be an ardent atheist; he was a skillful and highly\ningenious textile designer and became later in his career one of the\nmost influential leaders in the Austrian textile industry.\nFeigl\u2019s mother, who had a lifelong interest in the arts, filled\nhim with enthusiasm for classical music, particularly for the\nsymphonies of Anton Bruckner and Gustav Mahler. In 1921, Feigl began\nto study mathematics, physics, and philosophy at the University of\nMunich. Because of the anti-Semitic climate in Germany (and in\nparticular in Munich) he moved, in 1922, to the University of Vienna\nwhere he studied under Moritz Schlick, Hans Hahn, Hans Thirring, and\nKarl B\u00fchler. In the very same year, he wrote an essay on the\nphilosophical significance of Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity\nfor which he obtained a prize in a competition (with Schlick, Ernst\nvon Aster and Max von Laue as referees). In 1924, Feigl became one of\nthe co-founders of the Vienna Circle. In 1927, he finished his\ndoctoral dissertation in philosophy on the relationship between chance\nand law in the natural sciences. Inspired by discussions with Karl\nPopper and Hans Reichenbach, Feigl, in 1929, published the monograph\nTheorie und Erfahrung in der Physik. In the same year, he\ngave a series of lectures at the Bauhaus in Dessau, between which and\nthe Vienna Circle there were interesting parallels in both\nintellectual outlook and political approach (see Galison 1990). In\n1930 Feigl married Maria Kasper, a fellow student at the University of\nVienna, and had a son (Eric Feigl).\n\nFor reasons of anti-Semitism and occupational hopelessness, Feigl, in\n1930, decided to emigrate to the United States. Funded by a\nRockefeller Research Fellowship, he first stayed for eight months at\nHarvard University. Together with Albert E. Blumberg he wrote the\nprogrammatic article \u201cLogical Positivism: A New Movement in\nEuropean Philosophy\u201d (published in the spring of 1931 in the\nJournal of Philosophy).\u00a0Feigl\u2019s emigration plans\nthen became manifest. \u00a0Retrospectively, he reports:\n\nDuring the spring of 1931 [\u2026] it became clear to me that my\nchances for a teaching position in an Austrian or German University\nwere extremely slim. True, the ever so optimistic and kindly Schlick\nwas convinced that I would obtain a Privatdozentur (position as a\nlecturer) at the University of Vienna. But though I was Austrian by\nbirth, I had become a Czechoslovakian citizen after the revolution in\n1918. My home was then Reichenberg (Liberec), in the Sudetenland,\nwhere I was born and grew up, and had attended primary and secondary\nschools. My parents, though thoroughly \u2018assimilated\u2019, were\nof Jewish decent. More realistic than Schlick, I abandoned the idea of\na teaching career in Europe, and began applying in a number of\nAmerican universities.\u00a0(Feigl 1981, pp. 73\u20134)\n\nIn advance of applying to American universities, Feigl received\nletters of recommendation from Albert Einstein, Percy W. Bridgman, C.\nI. Lewis, and Alfred North Whitehead. Lewis wrote in his letter of\nApril 14, 1931: \u201cDr. Feigl is one of the group \u2013 with\nCarnap, Reichenbach, and Schlick \u2013 who represents the newly\nformulated \u2018neo-positivism,\u2019 which represents what we in\nAmerica are sure to regard as the most promising of present movements\nin Continental philosophy.\u201d (Quoted in Limbeck-Lilienau 2010, p.\n102) Feigl himself looking back:\n\nThree universities, Rutgers, New York University, and the State\nUniversity of Iowa, were the only ones that wanted to \u2018look me\nover\u2019, and toward the end of May 1931 I visited all three\nplaces. The late Dean George Kay [of the University of Iowa]\ntelephoned Professor Lewis long distance. As Lewis related to me, Dean\nKay asked him in detail about my qualification, character, and\npersonality. At the end of that (about twenty minutes!) telephone\nconversation, Kay finally asked: \u2018Is he a Jew?\u2019 To this,\nLewis, the noble New Englander, gave the \u2013 to me unforgettable\n\u2013 reply: \u2018I am sure I don\u2019t know, but if he is,\nthere is nothing disturbing about it\u2019.\u00a0(Feigl 1981, p.\n74)\n\nFrom 1931 to 1937 Feigl taught as a lecturer and assistant professor\nat the University of Iowa. In 1937, he was granted US citizenship.\nFrom 1938 to 1940 he served as an associate professor at the\nUniversity of Iowa. Eventually, in 1940, Feigl received a full\nprofessorship at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. There he\nfounded in 1953 the Minnesota Center for the Philosophy of Science\nwhich was the first center of that kind in the United States and which\nis still one of the leading institutions for research in the history\nand philosophy of science (further details in Neuber 2018a).\n\nApart from guest professorships in Berkeley (1946 and 1953), at\nColumbia University (1950) and at the University of Hawai\u2019i\n(1958), Feigl had research stays in Mexico, Australia, and Austria. He\nwas president of the American Philosophical Association and vice\npresident of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\nAmong the major works during his time in the United States are\nwritings on methodology, on the scientific realism debate and a couple\nof contributions to the mind-body problem, the most well-known of\nwhich is the essay \u201cThe \u2018Mental\u2019 and the\n\u2018Physical\u2019\u201d (1958). After his retirement in 1971,\nFeigl was still active as an organizer of philosophical discussions at\nhis private home. He died of cancer on June 1, 1988, in\nMinneapolis.\n2. Feigl and the Vienna Circle\n\nAs already indicated, Feigl was a member of the Vienna Circle from its\nvery beginning. Together with Friedrich Waismann he had suggested to\nSchlick the formation of an evening discussion group (see Feigl 1981,\np. 60). Schlick took over the idea and installed a Thursday evening\ncolloquium in the Vienna Boltzmanngasse 5, the location of the\nUniversity\u2019s Department of Mathematics. Among the co-founders of\nthe Circle were, besides Waismann and Feigl himself, Hans Hahn, Otto\nNeurath, Olga Hahn-Neurath, Viktor Kraft, Felix Kaufmann, and the\nmathematician Kurt Reidemeister. It was the latter who proposed the\nreading and discussion of Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus\nlogico-philosophicus. As Feigl reported in an unpublished\ninterview,\n\n[t]he approximate date of the beginning of the [Vienna Circle] was\n1924, but I do not remember whether it was in the spring or in the\nfall of that year. It was professor Kurt Reidemeister, the\nmathematician, who proposed the first reading of the Tractatus, and\nwho (together with Hahn, Schlick and Neurath) was most active in that\nfirst exegesis. I myself had read the first publication of the\nTractatus in Ostwald\u2019s Annalen der Naturphilosophie (1922, I\nbelieve), but at that time I was a very young student and I dismissed\nWittgenstein as a most curios mixture of intuitive genius and\nschizophrenia. (Quoted from Stadler 1997, p. 233)\n\n\nHowever, the reading of Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus was\nonly one of a number of topics discussed within the Circle. According\nto Feigl, \u201cabout 60 % of our time was devoted to the problems of\nthe foundation of mathematics and the rest to philosophy of science\nand epistemology\u201d (ibid.). Between 1926 and 1928 it was the\nreading of (the typescript of) Rudolf Carnap\u2019s Der logische\nAufbau der Welt which dominated the discussion.\n\nAs for Feigl\u2019s own development, his doctoral dissertation under\nSchlick\u2019s supervision should be mentioned first. Submitted in\nJuly1927, the purpose of this study was to examine the problem of the\napplication of the probability calculus, hence its title \u201cChance\nand law: an epistemological analysis of the roles of probability and\ninduction in the natural sciences.\u201d Heavily inspired by Edgar\nZilsel\u2019s Das Anwendungsproblem (1916), Feigl argued\nalong pragmatic (Humean) lines. His central thesis was that the\nproblem of induction cannot be solved by making recourse to the\nprobability concept. Feigl, thereby criticizing especially the point\nof view defended by Hans Reichenbach, proposed instead a\n\u2018vindication\u2019 rather than a \u2018validation\u2019 of\ninductive reasoning. Relying on a frequency interpretation of\nprobability, he argued that the limiting value of an infinite sequence\ncan only be inferred inductively, which in turn implied that\nprobability is dependent on induction and not vice versa.\nConcerning the principle of induction itself, Feigl (like his teacher\nSchlick) saw no other possibility than to interpret it as a pragmatic\n(or operational) maxim. On the whole, however, the approach laid down\nin Feigl\u2019s dissertation was, as Feigl himself later conceded\n(see Feigl 1981, p. 6), severely limited by its neglect of the\nsimultaneous rise and development of quantum mechanics.\n\nIt was in the 1929 book Theorie und Erfahrung in der Physik\nthat Feigl reflected on the philosophical significance of quantum\nmechanics. In addition he elaborated on the more general issues of\nscientific explanation and the hypothetico-deductive method in theory\nconstruction, thereby informally anticipating ideas later developed in\nmore detail by Karl Popper and especially by Carl Gustav Hempel. On\nthe programmatic level, Feigl criticized both Kantianism and\nconventionalism and argued, positively, for a \u2018critical\nrealist\u2019 approach to the relationship of theory and experience\nin physics. The book, which received favorable reactions by practicing\nphysicists such as Albert Einstein and Wolfgang Pauli, was\nFeigl\u2019s only book in German language. Its exposed position with\nrespect to programmatic outlook Feigl retrospectively described as\nfollows:\n\nAlthough I had been in the \u2018loyal opposition\u2019 in regard to\nthe positivism of the Vienna Circle, I had a hard time maintaining\nagainst them the sort of critical realism that I had originally\nlearned to adopt from Schlick\u2019s own early work [\u2026]. Under\nthe influence of Carnap and the early Wittgenstein, Schlick and\nWaismann were converted to a sort of phenomenalistic positivism during\nthe middle twenties. Their brilliant and powerful arguments\noverwhelmed me temporarily. But encouraged and buttressed by the\nsupport of Popper, Reichenbach, and Zilsel, I regained confidence in\nmy earlier realism and developed it in my first book on Theorie\nund Erfahrung in der Physik [\u2026]. (Feigl 1981, pp.\n9\u201310)\n\n\nThat Schlick was converted to \u201cphenomenalistic positivism\u201d\nmight be contested (see Geymonat 1985); but, beyond the shadow of a\ndoubt, Feigl\u2019s realistic reconstruction of the theories of\nphysics had a minority status within the Vienna Circle. After his\nemigration to the United States, Feigl devoted much of his work to\ndeveloping a stable realist stance.\n3. Logical Empiricism and Scientific Realism\n\nIt is commonly supposed that logical empiricism and scientific realism\nare systematically at odds. However, Feigl\u2019s diverse\ncontributions to the scientific realism debate just suggest the\nopposite: Influenced by the early \u2018critical\u2019 realism of\nhis teacher Schlick, Feigl (like Reichenbach and Eino Kaila) argued in\nterms of a reconciliation of both positions, that is, he attempted to\ncombine logical empiricist methods with a scientific realist account\nof theoretically postulated entities (see, in this connection, also\nNeuber 2012, esp. pp. 45\u201351, and especially Neuber 2018b, ch.\n5).\n\nTo begin with, in their 1931 article \u201cLogical Positivism: A New\nMovement in European Philosophy,\u201d Feigl and Blumberg presented\nthe logical positivist approach as the synthesis of two\n\u201csignificant traditions\u201d (Feigl/Blumberg 1931, p. 281):\nthe classical \u201cpositivistic-empirical\u201d current in European\nphilosophy, and the development of modern (mathematical) logic. The\nmost characteristic feature of the emerging \u201cnew movement\u201d\nwas, according to Feigl and Blumberg, its conception of the\npropositions of metaphysics as \u201cmeaningless\u201d (ibid., p.\n282). This diagnosis also pertained to Kant\u2019s account of\nsynthetic a priori judgments, the existence of which was\nexplicitly contested. However, it must be seen that Feigl never went\nas far as to reject the analytic/synthetic distinction as such. As he\nlater argued against Quine, \u201c[t]he revolt against the dualism of\nthe analytic and the synthetic rests on a confusion of the logical\nanalysis of (artificially fixed) languages with the historical\ninvestigation of (growing, shifting natural) languages\u201d (Feigl\n1956, p. 7\u20138). Thus, in the logical positivist account, analytic\npropositions had to be sharply distinguished from synthetic\npropositions. Whereas the latter had their place in experience and\nexperiential science, the former belonged to logic and mathematics.\nMore precisely, Feigl and Blumberg agreed with Wittgenstein that\nlogic, by its very nature, is purely tautological. It has nothing to\ndo with experience, but only with the internal structure of language.\nHere, they saw the principle advantage over previous, traditional,\nempiricist accounts of logic and mathematics. Moreover, Feigl and\nBlumberg maintained that even the concepts of the empirical sciences\nare such as can be subject to a purely formal, logical,\nreconstruction. Relying on a principled distinction between\n\u201cknowledge proper\u201d (Erkenntnis) and objectivity,\non the one hand, and \u201cimmediate experience\u201d\n(Erlebnis) and subjectivity, on the other, they referred the\nreader to Carnap\u2019s Der logische Aufbau der Welt,\nthereby implying that a constitution of empirical concepts from a\nsingle primitive relation, namely that of\n\u201c\u00c4hnlichkeitserinnerung\u201d, by \u201cpurely\nlogical operations\u201d (Feigl/Blumberg 1931, p. 286) was at least\nin sight. The essential point in this connection was that the\npropositions of empirical science were supposed to be translatable\ninto a series of propositions which exclusively referred to structural\nfeatures of experience, but not to the experientially given itself\n(which was conceived of as completely subjective and thus\n\u2018private\u2019). It was therefore structure which stood in the\nfocus of the respective reconstruction of empirical knowledge.\nKnowledge, according to Feigl and Blumberg, is to be defined as\n\u201cthe communicable\u201d (ibid.) and \u201c[w]hat knowledge\ncommunicates is structure [\u2026].\u201d (ibid.)\n\nIt was just a few years later that Feigl\u2014rather\nsignificantly\u2014modified his point of view. Or, as he himself\nreports:\n\nHaving stereotyped myself (in the notorious fanfare article written in\ncollaboration with A. E. Blumberg [\u2026]), as a \u2018logical\npositivist,\u2019 the label has stuck to me ever since. As early as\n1935, however, I abandoned the label [\u2026] and availed myself of\nthe alias \u2018logical empiricist.\u2019 This was triggered by a\nremark of a French philosopher at the International Congress for the\nUnity of Science in Paris (1935). He burst out at me: \u2018Les\npositivists, ce sont des idiots!\u2019 (Feigl 1981, p. 38)\n\n\nThe programmatic impact of the distinction drawn here by Feigl between\n\u2018logical positivism\u2019 and \u2018logical empiricism\u2019\nmight be doubted (see Uebel 2013). However, in order to adequately\nunderstand the line of Feigl\u2019s philosophical development, the\ndistinction is quite apt. Thus, in the first instance, it was the\nliberalization of the logical positivist criterion of meaning which\ncaused a shift in Feigl\u2019s general philosophical outlook.\nAccording to the early, logical positivist, conceptions of language\nand science, the meaning of a proposition must be anchored in\nobservable facts. More precisely, the meaning of a given proposition\nis entirely exhausted by its verification on a purely observational\nbasis. Yet it turned out, as a major consequence of the Vienna\nCircle\u2019s protocol-sentence debate (see Uebel 2007), that this\ncriterion was far too strict. Direct verifiability was (by Carnap,\nHempel, and others) substituted through weaker criteria such as (at\nleast indirect) testability (see Carnap 1936/37) or confirmability and\ndisconfirmability (see Hempel 1935; 1945; 1950a). Nevertheless, the\nlogical positivists\u2019 rejection of metaphysics remained\nquintessentially intact. As Feigl points out in a paper titled\n\u201cScientific Method without Metaphysical Presuppositions\u201d\n(1954), there are two senses in which the term\n\u2018metaphysics\u2019 appears objectionable also from the\nliberalized, logical empiricist, perspective; namely a) the assertion\nof transcendent, i.e., in principle untestable statements, and b) the\nbelief in factual truths that could be validated a priori, i.e., in\ncomplete independence of the data of observation. In both cases, the\nrealm of the meaningful is distinguished from these two objectionable\nregions.\n\nAnother, systematically more far-reaching aspect of Feigl\u2019s\n(self-ascribed) shift from logical positivism to logical empiricism\nwas his increasingly explicit embrace of a \u2018realist\u2019\napproach to science and scientific theory construction. In\nFeigl\u2019s own words: \u201cPerhaps the most important and\nconstructive aspect in the transition to Logical Empiricism was the\nelement of empirical or scientific realism that became increasingly\nprominent in our views. Reichenbach and I had already opposed the\nphenomenalistic reduction during the twenties. In this regard we were\ncloser to the views of Zilsel and Popper. We regretted that Schlick\nhad abandoned his early critical realism, and we tried to reinstate it\nin a more defensible form.\u201d (Feigl 1981, p. 80) At another\nplace, Feigl indicates:\u00a0\u201cMy own emancipation began in the\nmiddle thirties and was stabilized in the forties. Studies and\nteaching in the field of the philosophy of science helped me regain,\nrefine, and buttress my earlier realistic position. I was also greatly\nencouraged by the scientific realism of Hans Reichenbach and the\nrealistic epistemologies of my steadfast dear friends Roy W. Sellars\nand Wilfrid Sellars.\u201d (Feigl1981, p. 39)\n\nIt was as early as 1935 that Feigl, at the above quoted International\nCongress for the Unity of Science in Paris, gave a talk on\n\u201cSense and Nonsense in Scientific Realism\u201d (see Feigl\n1936; further Neuber 2011, p. 169). In 1943, then, he published a\npaper titled \u201cLogical Empiricism.\u201d There, he argued that\nthe term \u2018real\u2019 is employed with good reason (both in\ndaily life and in science) to designate \u201cthat which is located\nin space-time and which is a link in the chains of causal\nrelations\u201d (Feigl 1949, p. 16). In this sense, the reality of\natoms (and other theoretically postulated entities) is equally capable\nof empirical test as the reality of rocks and trees. Accordingly,\nreality should be ascribed to whatever is confirmed as having a place\nin the spatiotemporal-causal system. After all,\nthis\u2014realistically inspired\u2014point of view directly emerged\nfrom the liberalization of the logical empiricists\u2019 criterion of\nmeaning. It was indeed the result of the insight that \u201cmost of\nour knowledge, and especially almost all of the more interesting and\nimportant part of it, is highly indirect. It is shot through with\ninterpretation, construction, and inference, and consequently is\ndependent on very general assumptions\u201d (ibid., p. 14).\n\nHowever, Feigl\u2019s mature conception of a synthesis of scientific\nrealism and logical empiricism is to be found in his 1950 article\n\u201cExistential Hypotheses\u201d (published in Philosophy of\nScience). There, it was semantics which served as the\nvehicle for Feigl\u2019s promotion of the realist project. By\n\u2018semantics,\u2019 Feigl meant (in a nutshell) the formal\nscrutiny of reference and truth (see Feigl 1950a, p. 36). As such, it\nhad nothing to do with the concrete methods of testing hypotheses.\nRather, \u201csemantic realism,\u201d as Feigl pointed out at\nanother place, \u201cis concerned only with the most abstract and\nformal features of the semiotic situation\u201d (1950b, p. 192). This\nimplied, in particular, that a) reference must be sharply\ndistinguished from evidence, and that b) truth must be sharply\ndistinguished from verification. It was on this basis that Feigl saw\nhimself in a position to avoid \u201cthe reductive fallacies of\nphenomenalism\u201d (1950a, p. 35). By the \u201creductive fallacies\nof phenomenalism,\u201d he meant the logical constructionist accounts\nof Bertrand Russell (1914) and the early Carnap (1928). In\nRussell\u2019s and Carnap\u2019s view, the theoretical statements of\nthe empirical sciences were, at least according to Feigl,\n\u201cconsidered as translatable into statements concerning the data\nof direct experience\u201d (1950a, p. 35). This conception was, in\nFeigl\u2019s eyes, \u201cfallacious\u201d because the assumption of\ncomplete translatability was, he thought, semantically misguided.\nTheoretical sentences should be invested with what Feigl called their\n(so to say \u2018untranslatable\u2019) \u201csurplus\nmeaning.\u201d This surplus meaning he considered to consist in the\n\u201cfactual reference\u201d of theoretical terms (ibid., p. 48).\nMore concretely, Feigl was convinced that terms like\n\u2018atom,\u2019 \u2018force,\u2019 or \u2018electromagnetic\nfield\u2019 cannot be reduced to purely observational terms\ndescribing our direct experiences. Rather, theoretical terms were\nsupposed to refer to unobservable, mind-independent entities, so that,\nfor example, the referent of the term \u2018atom\u2019 would be real\natoms and not samples of \u2018logical constructions\u2019 out of\nsense data (or other kinds of directly perceivable things). Therefore,\nFeigl urged that \u201cwe must distinguish between the radical\nempiricist\u2019s meaning of \u2018meaning\u2019 (i.e., epistemic\nreduction) and another, more common-sensical meaning of\n\u2018meaning\u2019 (factual reference)\u201d (ibid., p. 49).\n\nIt has (very aptly) been remarked that Feigl\u2019s \u201csemantic\nrealism is an anti-reductive position\u201d (Psillos 1999, p. 12). It\nis anti-reductive insofar as the theoretical language of science is\nclaimed to be autonomous in relation to the observational evidence\nbase. Consequently, the mind-independence of the \u2018factual\nreferents\u2019 of theoretical terms seems to be secured by the very\nreference relation itself: the existence of theoretical entities like\natoms is obviously implied by the independent reference of theoretical\nterms like \u2018atom.\u2019\n\nMoreover, Feigl\u2019s account of factual reference is intimately\nlinked with the concept of truth. In general, the meaning of a\nsentence consists, according to the theory proposed by Feigl, in its\ntruth conditions (see Feigl 1950b, p. 191 and Feigl 1981, p. 43).\nThese truth conditions, in turn, are treated compositionally: they\nobtain when the entities to which we refer stand in the relations to\nwhich we refer, that is, independently of the conditions of the\ncorresponding scenario of verification. Accordingly, relations between\nthe \u2018factual referents\u2019 of theoretical terms serve as\n\u2018truth makers\u2019 for theoretical statements. Feigl therefore\nconcludes that by adopting a \u201csemantic metalanguage\u201d (as\nhe could find it in the works of Tarski and the later Carnap) we are\nin a position to employ \u201ca conceptual model in which statements\nas well as the states of affairs that render these statements true,\ncan be represented\u201d (Feigl 1950a, p. 49).\n\nStill, there is an important qualification in Feigl\u2019s account of\nrealism. This qualification has to do with the fact that Feigl takes\npains to separate his own semantic-scientific realism from traditional\nmetaphysical realism. By metaphysical realism, Feigl means all\nattempts to systematically employ \u201ctranscendent, i.e., in\nprinciple untestable, assertions\u201d (Feigl 1956, p. 22). By his\nown account, however, the testability or confirmability of an\nassertion is the crucial criterion for its being meaningful. Feigl\nwrites:\n\nNo concrete existential hypothesis of ordinary life or of science is\nfactually meaningful unless it is confirmable. The essential\nrequirement of empiricism is thus safeguarded. But the very adoption\nof the confirmability criterion (in preference to the\nnarrower verifiability criterion) allows as much realism as\nwe are ever likely to warrant. (1950a, pp. 50\u201351)\n\n\nAnd at another place, he comments:\n\nSemantic realism as I should like to see it understood, is free from\nthe dangers of metaphysics precisely because it does not\nprescribe anything at all about the nature of the\ndesignata of our theoretical constructs. [\u2026] Things are and\nwill always be\u2014as far as we can meaningfully talk about\nthem\u2014what they are confirmably knowable as; and it is\nup to the advance of science, not to logical and semiotic analysis, to\ntell us what things are \u201creally\u201d like. But it is the task\nof logical analysis to tell us by means of what rules of our language\nwe describe the objects of our knowledge, and [\u2026] what we mean\nby the surplus of the knowable over the known.\n(1950b, p. 192)\n\n\nIt should be noted that this passage is quoted from Feigl\u2019s\nreply to criticisms brought forward by his logical empiricist\ncolleagues Philipp Frank, Carl Gustav Hempel, and Ernest Nagel (the\ncontext being a symposium on Feigl\u2019s \u201cExistential\nHypotheses\u201d). Hempel, for instance, had argued that the notion\nof the reference of theoretical terms is \u201cunnecessary\u201d\nbecause it \u201ccan be eliminated, by means of Feigl\u2019s own\ncriterion of factual reference\u201d (Hempel 1950b, p. 173), namely\nthe systematic interconnections between theoretical statements on the\none hand and observations sentences on the other. In a similar vein,\nFrank had objected that \u201cafter the introduction of the truth\nconditions a statement in the language of \u2018semantical\nrealism\u2019 can no longer be distinguished from a statement in the\nlanguage of \u2018syntactical positivism\u2019\u201d (Frank 1950,\np. 167). Quite the same was brought forward by Nagel who argued that\nby heavily relying on confirmability Feigl completely remains within\nthe \u2018received\u2019 logical positivist agenda, so that his talk\nof \u2018realism\u2019 should be regarded as devoid of any\ndistinctive character. According to Nagel, \u201cFeigl is pressing\nfor a distinction without a difference\u201d (Nagel 1950, p.\n179).\n\nIn order to counter these objections one would have to show how\nsemantics (i.e., Feigl\u2019s theory of reference and truth) and\nepistemology (i.e., Feigl\u2019s insistence on confirmability) are\nrelated to each other. There is some evidence that Feigl\u2019s\nadoption of Wilfrid Sellars\u2019s idea of a \u2018pure\npragmatics\u2019 (see Feigl 1950a, pp. 49\u201350; 1981, pp.\n254\u2013255) could play the essential role in this connection.\nHowever, Sellars\u2019s conception of a \u2018pure pragmatics\u2019\nis itself rather \u201ceccentric\u201d (Carus 2004, p. 320) and it\nis fairly hard to see how, according to Feigl, a realist approach to\nscience could be defended on the basis of an essentially pragmatic\njustification (for further details, see Neuber 2011, pp.\n175\u2013176, and especially Neuber 2017)\n4. Analysis of the Mind-Body Problem\n\nFeigl\u2019s treatment of the mind-body problem is his probably best\nwell-known\u2014and at the same time most\ncontroversial\u2014contribution to philosophy. It is often lumped\ntogether with the views of U.T. Place, J.J.C. Smart, D.M. Armstrong,\nand other Australian, \u2018materialist,\u2019 philosophers (see,\nfor example Kim 1998, pp. 1\u20132). Indeed, both Feigl\u2019s and\nthe Australians\u2019 approach toward the mind-body problem share a\nnumber of similarities. On the whole, they are both versions of a\nnon-dualistic (anti-Cartesian), physicalistically inspired\n\u2018identity theory.\u2019 However, there are significant\ndifferences between the Austrian (i.e. Feigl\u2019s) and the\nAustralian version of\u00a0the identity theory (see Stubenberg 1997).\nWhereas the Australians take the physical as unproblematic and attempt\nto reduce the mental to the physical, Feigl takes the mental as\nunproblematic and attempts to integrate it into a sophisticated\nphysicalistic conception of the world.\n\nIt is important to note that Feigl\u2019s version of the identity\ntheory is not without precursors. It has even been argued that\n\u201c[s]een against the backdrop of nineteenth-century German and\nAustrian philosophy, Feigl\u2019s approach was neither novel nor\naudacious; he merely revived a tradition that had once been a\nmainstream topic turned unfashionable; to be exact, he modified and\nspelled out one specific traditional position\u201d (Heidelberger\n2003, p. 234). This might be exaggerated, but it can hardly be\ncontested that Feigl, in his treatment of the mind-body problem, was\n(again) committed to the critical realist accounts of Alois Riehl (cf.\nRiehl 1879, 1881, 1887; further R\u00f6d 2001) and especially of the\nearly (pre-Viennese) Schlick (see the entry on\n Moritz Schlick).\n As Feigl himself frequently pointed out, it was the early\nSchlick\u2019s \u201cdouble-knowledge\u201d or\n\u201cdouble-language\u201d theory that exerted the greatest\ninfluence upon his own approach (see, for example, Feigl 1981, p.\n288). In a nutshell, Schlick, in his General Theory of\nKnowledge (1918; 1925), had argued that the difference of the\nmental and the physical is a difference between two conceptual systems\nand not a difference between two areas of reality. It was, in other\nwords, an epistemological rather than a metaphysical problem (cf.\nSchlick 1974, p. 300). According to Schlick, the \u201crelation\nbetween immediately experienced reality and the physical brain\nprocesses is [\u2026] no longer one of causal dependency but of\nsimple identity. What we have is one and the same reality,\nnot \u2018viewed from two different sides\u2019 or\n\u2018manifesting itself in two different forms\u2019, but\ndesignated by two different conceptual systems, the psychological and\nthe physical\u201d (ibid., p. 299). It was this very line of thought\nthat confirmed Feigl in his conviction that \u201cthe mind-body\nproblem is not a pseudoproblem\u201d (Feigl 1981, p. 349).\n\nThe essential question to be answered by an elaborated identity theory\nis, in Feigl\u2019s view, the following: \u201c[H]ow are the raw\nfeels related to behavioral (or neurophysiological) states?\u201d\n(1967, p. 5) By posing the question that way, Feigl excludes a\nreductive solution to the mind-body problem. More precisely, he\ndissociates himself from the \u201creductive fallacies\u201d (1981,\np. 16) of eliminative materialism and of radical behaviorism. On the\nother hand, however, Feigl is eager to demarcate his own position from\novertly\u2014metaphysically inspired\u2014dualistic conceptions,\nsuch as parallelism or epiphenomenalism. He explicitly opts for a\n\u201cmonistic solution\u201d (ibid., p. 298), arguing that the\ndualistic position would lead to an ungrounded \u201cduplication of\nrealities\u201d (1967, p. 94), whereas the\u2014scientifically\nwell-established\u2014principle of parsimony \u201cdoes oppose the\noperationistic predilection for speaking of two (or more) concepts if\nthe evidential facts, though completely correlated, are qualitatively\nheterogeneous\u201d (ibid.)\n\nOn the constructive side, Feigl\u2019s solution to the mind-body\nproblem might indeed be regarded as a direct continuation of the\nearlier \u2018double-language\u2019 conception presented by Schlick.\nLike in the case of the realism issue, Feigl attempts at a\nsemantically more sophisticated revision of the original Schlickian\npoint of view. One can even go further and say that it is the very\nsame terminology which is employed by Feigl in this connection. Thus,\njust like in the case of realism, Feigl categorically distinguishes\nthe evidential (or confirmatory) basis from the factual reference (or\ncontent) of the respective knowledge claims. Feigl writes:\n\nThe central core of the proposed solution rests upon the distinction\nbetween evidence and reference. No matter what indirect (behavioral)\nevidence we use for the ascription of mental states, the mental state\nascribed is not to be confused with the evidence which only leads\nsupport for the ascription. (Feigl 1967, p. 99)\n\n\nAccordingly, it is mental states which are to be regarded as the\nreferents of both psychological and physical terms. More precisely,\nFeigl assumes that, in the case of psychological terms, evidence is\nderived from (direct) knowledge by acquaintance, whereas in the case\nof physical (neurophysiological) terms evidence is derived from\n(indirect) knowledge by description (see Feigl 1967, p. 94). Yet, the\nreferent is in both cases the same, so that we have a relation of\n\u2018referential identity,\u2019 as in the context of Gottlob\nFrege\u2019s example of the terms \u2018morning star\u2019 and\n\u2018evening star\u2019 that differ in sense (Sinn), but\nnot in reference (Bedeutung), which in both cases is\nidentical, namely Venus (see, for this analogy, Feigl 1981, pp.\n346\u2013347). Consequently, we have two kinds of evidence for one\nand the same type of events. It is for this reason that Feigl\u2019s\nidentity theory is committed to a dualism at the evidential basis. Or,\nas Feigl puts it in \u201cThe \u2018Mental\u2019 and the\n\u2018Physical\u2019\u201d:\n\n[W]hat is had-in-experience, and (in the case of human\nbeings) knowable by acquaintance, is identical with the\nobject of knowledge by description provided first by molar\nbehavior theory and this in turn is identical with what the science of\nneurophysiology describes (or, rather, will describe when\nsufficient progress has been achieved) as processes in the central\nnervous system, perhaps especially in the cerebral cortex. In its\nbasic core this is the \u201cdouble knowledge\u201d theory held by\nmany modern monistic critical realists. (1967, p. 79)\n\n\nIn the footnote attached to this passage, Feigl refers the reader to\nthe views of Riehl, Schlick, Russell, and Roy Wood Sellars (among\nothers); and he then continues:\n\nThis view does not have the disadvantage of the Spinozistic doctrine\nof the unknown or unknowable third of which the mental and\nthe physical are aspects. The \u201cmental\u201d states or events\n(in the sense of raw feels) are the referents (denotata) of the\nphenomenal terms of the language of introspection, as well as of\ncertain terms of the neurophysiological language. For this reason I\nhave in previous publications called my view a \u201cdouble-language\ntheory.\u201d (ibid., pp. 79\u201380)\n\n\nThere are two peculiarities to be noticed in Feigl\u2019s version of\nthe double-language theory. First, it must be seen that qualia (raw\nfeels) are, for Feigl, the\u2014epistemologically\u2014basic\nreality. On his conception, we have privileged access to this\nbasic reality, so that (as Feigl points out in the postscript to\n\u201cThe \u2018Mental\u2019 and the \u2018Physical\u2019\u201d)\nthe \u201cegocentric account\u201d (ibid., p. 155) must be regarded\nas the most immediate mode of getting into contact with reality,\nwhereas \u201call scientific accounts [\u2026] deal with Being only\nindirectly and structurally\u201d (ibid.; see also Feigl 1981, pp. 17\nand 351). The privileged access to qualia (such as seeing red, feeling\npain, etc.) is, according to Feigl, accompanied by the use of\nindexical terms (such as \u201chere\u201d, \u201cnow\u201d,\n\u201cI\u201d, etc.) that in turn form part of a\n\u201cprivate\u201d (egocentric) language and which are\nsystematically analyzed in the context of the metalinguistic\ndiscipline of pure pragmatics (see Feigl 1967, p. 147). Thus, in\nFeigl\u2019s view, \u201cI must be able to know (by\n\u2018acquaintance\u2019) some phenomenal qualities and relations\n(redness, between-ness, etc.) in order to \u2018hook\u2019 (i.e.\nconnect) my private language to the intersubjective language of\nscience\u201d (ibid.). At the same time, he sees no problem in\ndescribing private mental states by intersubjective scientific\n(neurophysiological) terms. \u201cPrivacy,\u201d Feigl writes,\n\u201cis capable of public (intersubjective) description, and the\nobjects of intersubjective science can be evidenced by data of private\nexperience\u201d (ibid., p. 81). After all, Feigl is convinced of the\n\u201cindispensability of a subjectivistically understood conception\nof immediate (first person) experience\u201d (Feigl 1981, p. 353),\nwhich, on the one hand, entails a clear rejection of Ludwig\nWittgenstein\u2019s arguments against the possibility of a private\nlanguage (see Feigl 1981, p. 355), and, on the other hand, marks a\nsignificant contrast to the Australians\u2019 strategy of\n\u2018explaining away\u2019 the phenomenal properties of mental\nstates (see, in this connection, Stubenberg 1997, pp. 135\u2013136).\nThe possible objection that Feigl, by epistemologically privileging\nqualia, runs into the trap of panpsychism can be countered by the\nargument that all reality is, in fact, \u201cat bottom\nqualitative\u201d (Stubenberg 1997, p. 143). Thus, not only mental\nstates, but also the diverse physical magnitudes (like mass, pressure,\ngravitational field intensity, etc.) are distinguishable only by their\nqualitative peculiarities (see Feigl 1967, pp. 43\u201344; see\nfurther Schlick 1974, pp. 283\u2013285). But this does not imply that\nall reality is, like panpsychism would have it, intrinsically psychic.\nQualia form part of reality, but reality comprises more than only\nqualia. The point is that qualia (raw feels) are, for Feigl,\nepistemologically privileged as compared to ordinary objects and the\nentities posited by science. \u201cReference to one\u2019s own\nimmediate experience,\u201d Feigl (in an overtly Schlickian manner)\nwrites, \u201cis the (epistemological) prototype of all designations\nof objects, properties or relations by the words of our\nlanguage\u201d (1981, p. 355).\n\nThe second point to be noticed is that, according to Feigl\u2019s\nversion of the identity theory, the mode of ascertainment of\nthe identity of the mental (raw feels) and the physical (neural\nprocesses) is empirical in character. Had Feigl in his first\npublication on the mind-body problem in 1934 assumed that the\nrelationship between the mental and the physical is that of a\nlogical identity (thereby implying that the language of\npsychology can be fully translated into the language of physics,\nviz. neurophysiology), he, in his later writings, no longer\nconceived of that identity as a logically necessary, but as an\nempirical (contingent) kind of identity. This meant, in the first\nplace, that the corroboration of the philosophically outlined\nmonism had to be provided, not by philosophical analysis again, but by\nthe factual sciences themselves. \u201cOn the whole,\u201d Feigl\nconcluded:\n\nI should think, the available evidence points with remarkable\nconsistency in the direction of a system of psychology, psycho-physics\nand psychophysiology which provides for the monistic solution here\noutlined. But this is the empirical, the factual issue which\nphilosophical analysis cannot decide and should not prejudge. (Feigl\n1981, p. 298)\n\n\nThe sort of modesty displayed in passages like the above is very\ncharacteristic of Feigl\u2019s way of thinking. Just as in his\ndiscussion of the realism issue, he leaves it to the factual sciences\nto judge about the adequacy of his preferred philosophical position.\nHis methodological outlook can therefore be characterized as\n\u201cmetascientific\u201d (rather than metaphysical), in the sense\nthat \u201ca comprehensive reflection on the results of\nscience as well as on the logic and epistemology of scientific\nmethod\u201d (ibid., p. 349) is aspired to. However, the\ndecision between global philosophical stances, like realism and\nphenomenalism or, as concerns the mind-body problem, monism and\ndualism cannot be decided by empirical means, but only by a\n\u201cpragmatic justification\u201d (ibid., p. 294). In the case of\nthe identity theory, this pragmatic justification is, as has been\npointed out before, guided by the principle of parsimony.\n\nFeigl\u2019s approach to the mind-body problem became subject of\nextended controversy. While some authors directly contested the\nidentity thesis as such (see, for example, Abelson 1970 and Epstein\n1973; further the replies in Gr\u00fcnbaum 1972 and Nathanson 1972),\nothers urged that Feigl should clarify his conception of the relation\nof phenomenal predicates and \u201craw feels.\u201d Especially\nFeigl\u2019s Minnesota collaborator Paul Meehl argued along these\nlines, claiming that the main problem with Feigl\u2019s view stems\nfrom semantics (see Meehl 1966; further Aune 1966). On the whole, it\ncan be said that identity theory was discussed from various\nphilosophical perspectives. That Feigl left a considerable legacy can\nhardly be denied in this connection.\n5. Writings on Value Judgment, Humanism, and Religion\n\nFeigl\u2019s writings on practical issues like ethics, humanism, and\nreligion are rather less well known (but see, rather recently, the\nreconstruction in Siegetsleitner 2014, ch. 11). Still, they are worth\nconsidering, especially since they contain some interesting\napplications and extensions of the logical empiricist agenda. The\nall-embracing idea, though, came from the eighteenth century:\nAccording to Feigl, \u201ca new age of enlightenment, scientific as\nwell as ethical, is our most imperative need\u201d (1981, p. 406).\nTherefore, \u201c[t]he straightforward spirit of eighteenth-century\nEnlightenment (e.g. Hume, Kant) needs reviving and\n\u2018updating\u2019\u201d (1981, p. 399). The programmatic frame\nfor this \u2018updating\u2019 Feigl labeled \u201cscientific\nhumanism\u201d (ibid., pp. 368, 405, 408, 418)\u2014by which he\nunderstood the attempt at a \u201csynthesis of the scientific\nattitude with an active interest in the whole scale of human\nvalues\u201d (ibid., p. 368). It was this conception within which he\ntheorized about the relationships between ethics and logic and between\nreligion and empirical science.\n\nAs concerns the relationship between ethics and logic, Feigl draws a\nprincipled distinction between two kinds of justification:\n\u201cvindication\u201d and \u201cvalidation\u201d (see Feigl\n1981, pp. 14, 256\u2013260, 385). While validation \u201cinvolves\nreliance upon the principles of logic\u201d (ibid., p. 245),\nvindication has to do with the pragmatics of evaluating certain types\nof behavior with respect to certain ends. Thus the latter, pragmatic,\nform of justification may be called \u2018justificatio\nactionis,\u2019 whereas the former, logical, form of\njustification may be called \u2018justificatio\ncognitionis\u2019 (see ibid., p. 385). Feigl\u2019s point,\nthen, is to show that specific ethical norms are capable of being\nvalidated, but that general ethical principles (and the respective\nethical systems) are only capable of being vindicated. Feigl\nwrites:\n\nValidation terminates with the exhibition of the norms that govern the\nrealm of argument concerned. If any further question can be raised at\nall, it must be the question concerning the pragmatic justification\n(vindication) of the (act of) adoption of the validating principles.\nBut this is a question of an entirely different kind. (1981, p. 386)\n\n\nTwo things should be noted here. First, in contrast to other logical\nempiricist accounts of ethics (for example, in the fist place, A.J.\nAyer\u2019s), Feigl\u2019s conception is, as has been argued (see\nKellerwessel 2010), committed to a certain form of\ncognitivism. That means that \u201cmoral judgments are to be\nreconstructed as knowledge-claims and as subject to validation (or\ninvalidation) by virtue of their accordance (or non-accordance) with\nthe supreme norms of a given ethical system\u201d (Feigl 1981, p.\n388). Accordingly, within such a given ethical system, moral\nreasoning can be justified by the \u201crules of deductive and\ninductive inference\u201d (ibid., p. 385) and thus be reconstructed\nalong cognitive, i.e. rational, lines. However, secondly, the\nrespective ethical system (and its \u201csupreme norms\u201d) itself\ncan only be vindicated by pragmatic maxims. Thus, Feigl\nallows the possibility of a \u201cpragmatic justification of the\nadoption of an alternative frame\u201d (ibid., p. 386), thereby\nimplying that there exists a plurality of alternative ethical systems.\nIt is interesting to see that Feigl refers the reader here to\nCarnap\u2019s distinction between \u201cinternal\u201d and\n\u201cexternal\u201d questions in his 1950 \u201cEmpiricism,\nSemantics, and Ontology\u201d (see Feigl 1981, p. 391, Fn. 3; see\nfurther Feigl 1981, pp. 13\u201314). Indeed, there is a deep analogy\nbetween this distinction drawn by Carnap and Feigl\u2019s distinction\nbetween the validation within an ethical system and the\nvindication of the ethical system (and its supreme norms)\nitself. Furthermore, it can be stated that Feigl, in his pragmatic\nargument for scientific realism, was also inspired by\nCarnap\u2019s distinction and its relativization of the ontological\ndimension (see, for further details, Neuber 2011, p. 179).\n\nOn the whole, scientific humanism is designed to avoid the extremes.\nIt qualifies, according to Feigl, as \u201ca tenable middle ground\nbetween the relativists and the absolutists in morals\u201d (1981, p.\n417). In contrast to relativism, it is assumed that certain basic\nhuman values, such as justice, fairness or equality, are universally\napplicable. However, in contrast to (for instance, Kantian)\nabsolutism, it is at the same time assumed that those values are\nrelated to human interests and thus empirically variable. They\n\u201cmay have come out of the natural development of human beings in\nthe social context\u201d (ibid., p. 420), and they can only be\njustified pragmatically (by way of vindication). But, Feigl maintains,\nthat does not make them arbitrary: \u201cIf we dig deeper into human\nnature we find that in some social contexts certain moral ideals\ninevitably work themselves out\u201d (ibid., p. 418). In the\n\u201cage of scientific enlightenment\u201d (ibid., p. 420) an\nethically disinterested or even cynical view of the world is therefore\nout of place: \u201cPsychology points in the direction of human needs\nand interests that must be satisfied. And in the social context,\ncertain traffic rules simply have to be obeyed if we are to survive as\na society. Thus we have ideals of justice and equality.\u201d\n(ibid.)\n\nFeigl\u2019s broadly naturalistic view of human beings and the world,\ntogether with the (liberalized) logical empiricist criterion of\nmeaning, entails a constructive but at the same time critical approach\ntoward religion. To be sure, Feigl did not deny the existence of\nreligious experiences (see, for example, Feigl 1981, 399\u2013400).\nBut he did not \u201csee [\u2026] the slightest reason for\naccepting any sort of theology\u201d (ibid., p. 399).\nAlthough some of the dogmas of theology were seen by Feigl as\n\u201cperfectly meaningful\u201d (ibid., p. 13), he conceived of\nthem as being false (or as being extremely unlikely). The option of a\n\u201cdemythologized\u201d (or modernized) theology\u00a0(Tillich,\nBultmann, Bonhoeffer, and others) is, Feigl further maintained,\n\u201cno longer a theology at all; it reduces to a moral message,\nformulated by the use of allegorical, but essentially exhorting,\nconsoling, edifying, or fortifying language\u201d (ibid., p. 406). By\naccepting scientific humanism, on the other hand, we are, according to\nFeigl, in a position to \u201cadopt an ethics without supernatural\nfoundation or supernatural sanctions\u201d (ibid., p. 405). Religious\nexperiences, in turn, are then explainable in purely naturalistic\nterms. They do not serve as the basis of scientific or everyday\nexplanation of human behavior. Rather, they are themselves\nsubject of scientific explanation. Or, in Feigl\u2019s own\nwords: \u201c[W]e do not need the theistic kind of reasoning in order\nto account for the phenomenon of religious experience. The influence\nof the cultural and moral traditions as well as psychology can provide\na very plausible naturalistic explanation of religious experience. As\nVoltaire once put it, if God didn\u2019t exist, he would have to be\ninvented.\u201d (ibid., pp. 415\u2013416)\n\nThree further points concerning Feigl\u2019s scientific humanism call\nfor comment. First, Feigl\u2019s early affiliation with American\nUnitarianism; second, his involvement in the American Humanist\nAssociation; third, the background to his plea for scientific humanism\nin Roy Wood Sellars\u2019 contributions in that field.\n\nOn the first point, suffice it to mention that Feigl served as\npresident of the Men\u2019s Club of the First Unitarian Church in\nIowa City as early as 1937\u201338 and that he still gave talks at the\nFirst Unitarian Society of Minneapolis in the late 1950s. Unitarian\nideals were values such as individual freedom, democratic processes in\nhuman relations, and universal brotherhood, undivided by nations,\nrace, or creed.\n\nThese ideals came very close to those of the American Humanist\nAssociation, which was founded in 1941. In 1944 Feigl was elected\nassistant secretary of the\u00a0Association. In retrospect, he writes:\n\n\n[O]ur attitude toward theology and religion was that of the naturalist\nor scientific humanists. Indeed, several of us found in the general\nposition of the American Humanist Association an ideology that seemed\nvery similar to our basic philosophical attitude. If, as most\nhumanists prefer, \u2018religion\u2019 is not connected with any\ntheology whatever, then a deep commitment to such human values as\nbasic and equal rights, the civil liberties, the ideal of a peaceful\nand harmonious world community, may well be said to be the religion of\nthe humanists \u2013 and of the positivists. (Feigl 1981, pp.\n78\u201379)\n\nBy \u2018us,\u2019 Feigl meant the emigrated logical empiricists.\nPhilipp Frank, in particular, also championed the humanist idea (see\nFrank 2021). \n\nAs for the influence of Roy Wood Sellars, the first thing to note is\nthat Sellars as early as 1918 had published a book titled The Next\nStep in Religion. In the preface to that book, Sellars made it\nclear that \u201cthe deepest spiritual life has always concerned\nitself with the appreciation and maintenance of values. He who\nacknowledges, and wishes to further, human values cannot be said to be\nirreligious or unspiritual\u201d (Sellars 1918, Foreword). Moreover,\nSellars pointed out: \u201cSuch attitudes and expectations as prayer,\nritual, worship, immortality, providence, are expressions of the\npre-scientific view of the world. But as man partly outgrows, partly\nlearns to reject the primitive thought of the world, this perspective\nand these elements will drop from religion.\u201d (p. 6) On this\nbasis, religion is redefined as \u201cloyalty to the values of\nlife\u201d (p. 7). In fact, Sellars\u2019 approach is deeply\nrooted in an appreciation of the progress of science (see esp. Sellars\n1918, ch. XVI) and thus comes quite close to Feigl\u2019s\nunderstanding of what he called scientific humanism. Moreover, Feigl\nhad certainly read the Humanist Manifesto, which Sellars,\ntogether with Raymond B. Bragg, had co-edited in 1933 (see Kurtz\n1973). As late as 1980, Feigl (like Willard von Orman Quine, A. J.\nAyer, and Sidney Hook) signed the Secular Humanist\nDeclaration of the Council for Democratic and Secular\nHumanism (see Kurtz 1983).\n\nMore recently, a view very close to Feigl\u2019s scientific humanism\nhas been advocated by Ronald Dworkin, according to whom\n\u201creligion is deeper than God\u201d (Dworkin 2013:1) and the\nreligious attitude \u201caccepts the full, independent reality of\nvalues\u201d (10). Like Feigl and Sellars, Dworkin views science as a\nparadigm for promoting human values.\n6. Feigl and Twentieth-Century Analytical Philosophy\n\nFeigl\u2019s role in the development of twentieth-century analytical\nphilosophy is not to be underrated. His 1950 article on\n\u201cExistential Hypotheses\u201d can, as has been argued (cf.\nNeuber 2011), be regarded as a ground-breaking contribution to the\ndebate over scientific realism within the analytical tradition. In\nparticular his focusing on the semantic notions of reference and truth\nturned out as instructive for the following development, as it is\nrepresented in the (programmatically diverse) writings of Richard\nBoyd, Larry Laudan, and specifically Hilary Putnam. In recent times,\nthe attempt has been made to revive Feigl\u2019s point of view by\nsystematically exploiting the idea of \u201cchoosing the realist\nframework\u201d (see Psillos 2011). Similarly, Feigl\u2019s analysis\nof the mind-body problem exerted remarkable influence on the\nphilosophical discourse of the second half of the twentieth century.\nThus, according to Jaegwon Kim, \u201cit was the papers by Smart and\nFeigl that introduced the mind-body problem as mainstream metaphysical\nProblematik of analytical philosophy, and launched the debate that has\ncontinued to this day\u201d (Kim 1998, p. 1). To be sure, alternative\napproaches, such as Putnam\u2019s \u2018functionalism\u2019 or\nDonald Davidson\u2019s \u2018anomalous monism\u2019 came up quite\nearly in the discussion. Nevertheless, Feigl\u2019s (and\nSmart\u2019s) account \u201chelped set basic parameters and\nconstraints for the debates that were to come\u2014a set of broadly\nphysicalist assumptions and aspirations that still guide and constrain\nour thinking today\u201d (ibid., p. 2)\n\nBesides these contributions to the theoretical discourse, Feigl played\nan important role at the institutional level. He not only founded and\nheaded the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science, but he also, in\n1949, founded and co-edited the (still existing) journal\nPhilosophical Studies and, in 1956, the series Minnesota\nStudies in the Philosophy of Science. Moreover, he edited such\nstandard setting volumes as Readings in Philosophical\nAnalysis (1949, together with Wilfrid Sellars) and Readings\nin the Philosophy of Science (1953, together with May Brodbeck).\nFurthermore, it should be emphasized that Feigl, together with Paul\nMeehl, energetically promoted the revalorization of\npsychology as a serious academic discipline. The Minnesota\nCenter was an extremely influential forum in this connection (for\nfurther details, see Smith 1986).\n\nBeing a scientific philosopher par excellence, Feigl once\ndeclared:\n\n[T]here is no sharp line of demarcation between (good) science and\n(clearheaded) philosophy. Every major scientific advance involves\nrevisions of our conceptual frameworks; and doing philosophy in our\ndays and age without regard to the problems and results of the\nsciences is\u2014to put it mildly\u2014intellectually unprofitable,\nif not irresponsible. (1967, p. 137)\n\n\nThis diagnosis, though provocative, is still accurate today.\n",
