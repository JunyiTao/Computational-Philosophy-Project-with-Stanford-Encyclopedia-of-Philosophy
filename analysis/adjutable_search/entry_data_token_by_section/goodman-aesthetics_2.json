    "main_text": "The Theory of Symbol Systems in Languages of Art\n3. The Theory of Symbol Systems in Languages of Art\n\nMost of Goodman\u2019s aesthetics is contained in his Languages\nof Art (which he republished, with slight variations, in a second\nedition in 1976), although what is there presented is clarified,\nexpanded, and sometimes corrected in later essays. As its subtitle,\nAn Approach to a General Theory of Symbols, indicates, this\nis a book with bearings not only on art issues, but on a general\nunderstanding of symbols, linguistic and non-linguistic, in the\nsciences as well as in ordinary life. Indeed, Languages of\nArt has, amongst its merits, that of having broken, in a\nnon-superficial and fruitful way, the divide between art and science.\nGoodman\u2019s general view is that we use symbols in our perceiving,\nunderstanding, and constructing the worlds of our experience: the\ndifferent sciences and the different arts equally contribute to the\nenterprise of understanding the world. As in his works in\nepistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of language, Goodman\u2019s\napproach is often unorthodox and groundbreaking, and yet never in ways\nthat fail to be refreshing and suggestive of future developments (some\nof those developments were pursued by Goodman himself in later essays\nand, most notably, in his last book, co-authored with Catherine Elgin,\nReconceptions in Philosophy and Other Arts and Sciences\n[1988]).\n\nWith respect to art in particular and to symbolic activities in\ngeneral, Goodman advocates a form of cognitivism: by using\nsymbols we discover (indeed we build) the worlds we live in, and the\ninterest we have in symbols\u2014artworks amongst them\u2014is\ndistinctively cognitive. Indeed, to Goodman, aesthetics is but a\nbranch of epistemology. Paintings, sculptures, musical sonatas, dance\npieces, etc. are all made of symbols, which possess different\nfunctions and bear different relations with the worlds they refer to.\nHence, artworks require interpretation, and interpreting them amounts\nto understanding what they refer to, in which way, and within which\nsystems of rules.\n\nSymbolizing is for Goodman the same as referring. Hence, it is\nimportant here to emphasize, first, that reference has, in his view,\ndifferent modes, and, second, that something is a symbol, and\nis a symbol of a given kind, only within a symbol system of\nthat kind, a system governed by the syntactical and semantic rules\nthat are distinctive of symbols of that kind. Of course, natural\nlanguages are examples of symbol systems, but there are many other,\nnon-linguistic systems: pictorial, gestural, diagrammatic, etc.\n",
