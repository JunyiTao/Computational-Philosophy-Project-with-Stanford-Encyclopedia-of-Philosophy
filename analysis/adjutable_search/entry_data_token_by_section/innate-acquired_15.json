They are sensitive to both the\nallelic combinations that a researcher studies and also to range of\nenvironments that a researcher includes in her analysis. Quantitative\ngeneticists recognize that a given genetic variant (allele) will have\nvariable phenotypic effects across different environments. These\nresponses are often nonlinear, such that gradual increases in an\nenvironmental parameter do not have correspondingly gradual phenotypic\neffects. At the same time, different genetic variants (alleles)\ncompared against a single environment will often produce a range of\nphenotypic effects. Quantitative geneticists typically represent these\ninteractions with a graphical tool called the norm of reaction. These\ndiagrams were introduced at around the same time as the idea of the\ngene and the distinction between genotype and phenotype (Sarkar 1999)\nand have long been advocated as the clearest way to think about the\nrole of genes in development (Hogben 1933; Lewontin 1974; Gottlieb\n1995; Kitcher 2001). Suppose, for example, that with respect to some\nenvironmental variable (E) an organism with a given genotype (G1) will\ndevelop the same phenotype (P) way no matter what value the\nenvironmental variable takes (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. A norm of reaction in which\nthe phenotype P is \u2018genetically determined\u2019\n\n\nIf a norm of reaction has this shape, we can say that P is\n\u2018genetically determined\u2019 even though it has an\nenvironmental factor as one of its causes. Philip Kitcher suggests\nthat some norms of reaction may have this form, but only in some\nlimited, but perhaps contextually important, range of environments\n(Kitcher 2001). For example, a disease caused by the loss of one or\nboth normal copies of a gene might develop in every\nenvironment except those specifically structured as clinical\ninterventions to cure the disease.\n\nAnother norm of reaction is one in which genetic and environmental\nfactors interact \u2018additively\u2019 (Figure 2). Genotype makes a\nconstant difference across some range of environments. While\nthe genetic variable does not determine the actual value of the trait\nin each individual, it does determine the differences between\nindividuals. Moreover, when the norms of reaction have this form,\nheritability scores become relevant to the question of whether and how\nmuch a phenotype can be altered by environmental intervention, as\ndiscussed in the previous section. A famous diagram in the early days\nof behavior genetics depicted the relationship between IQ (P),\ngenotype (G) and the \u2018enrichment\u2019 of the environment (E)\nas having roughly this form (Gottesman 1963a). If correct, this would\nmean that educational enrichment would cause every individual to get a\nhigher test score, but would not change the ordering of their\nscores.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Purely additive interaction\nbetween genotype and environment\n\n\nIn perhaps the most famous paper on this topic the geneticist Richard\nLewontin (1974) argued that actual norms of reaction are likely to be\nnon-additive (Figure 3). In that case, it makes no sense to talk of a\nparticular genotype \u2018determining\u2019 a phenotypic difference.\nGenotype and environment jointly determine the outcome in the\nstraightforward sense that the effect of each factor on the outcome is\na function of the particular value taken by the other factor. Whether\nnorms of reaction are typically non-additive and exactly what this\nimplies is the subject of an extensive scientific and philosophical\nliterature on \u2018gene-environment interaction\u2019, as discussed\nin the previous section.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Non-additive interaction\nbetween genotype and environment\n\n\nKitcher (2001) argues that \u2018genetic determinism\u2019 should be\nunderstood as the claim that many norms of reaction have roughly the\n\u2018determinist\u2019 shapes depicted in Figures 1 and 2.\n\nIn recent philosophical literature on innateness, Sober (1998) is\noften credited with the proposal that innateness might be defined as a\nflat norm of reaction (but see Cassidy (1979) for an earlier\nexposition of this idea). According to Sober:\n\n\u2026it is a reasonable hypothesis that the most that can be\nsalvaged from the ancient concept of innateness is this: a\nphenotypic trait is innate for a given genotype if and only if that\nphenotype will emerge in all of a range of developmental\nenvironments. What counts as the appropriate range of\nenvironments is left open in this proposal. Perhaps there is a\nuniquely correct answer to this question; then again, maybe the range\nis determined pragmatically. It is difficult to see how the latter\nconclusion can be evaded. (1998, author\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nSo if the \u2018ancient\u2019 concept of innateness is to be\nsalvaged in this way, the problem of context sensitivity looms large.\nAny given trait is bound to develop in some environmental contexts and\nbe absent in others. Sober\u2019s hope is that this issue can be\nsolved \u201cpragmatically\u201d. This is reminiscent of\nSamuels\u2019 (2002) suggestion that the question of what counts as a\n\u201cnormal\u201d environment should be left to scientists and is\nnot something for philosophers to resolve. Of course, this agnostic\nattitude does not make the problem go away. The fact remains that\nanyone proposing to define innateness in terms of developmental\nstability will have to justify their choice of relevant environments.\nThe fact that scientists can and do manage to perform quantitative\ngenetic analyses does not allay the concern that their choice of which\nenvironmental conditions to consider may be arbitrary or\ninappropriate.\n\nIn his seminal paper \u2018The idea of innateness\u2019 (1975)\nStephen Stich made a similar suggestion, that an innate trait might be\ndefined as one which an organism will manifest in the\n\u201cnormal\u201d course of development. But Stich himself offered\na counterexample to this analysis: universally held beliefs, such as\nthe belief that water quenches thirst, will count as innate on this\nanalysis, which seems counterintuitive (Stich 1975, 9). Andr\u00e9\nAriew has offered another counterexample: humans acquire a typical gut\nflora during development, but these bacteria are intuitively an\nacquired trait rather than an innate trait (Ariew 1999, 133). Ariew\nsuggests that Stich\u2019s analysis confuses evidence for innateness\nwith innateness itself. Universality is evidence for the existence of\na particular kind of developmental mechanism which Ariew explicates in\nterms of Waddington\u2019s concept of environmental canalization\n(Ariew 2007, 10, and see Section 3.4 below).\n\nKhalidi (2002) identifies a further objection to the proposal that\ninnateness can be defined as invariance across some\n\u201cnormal\u201d range of environments. Sometimes, he notes, the\nstrongest evidenced that a trait is innate is its capacity to develop\nin highly abnormal conditions. Consider the deprivation\nexperiments deployed by early ethologists, where animals were raised\nin social isolation or other impoverished circumstances. The tendency\nfor a trait to develop even under these (abnormal) conditions was\nregarded as strong evidence of its innateness. From this perspective\nit seems utterly wrong-headed to define innateness in terms of some\nnormal range, so long as \u201cnormal\u201d is defined as the\nenvironments which a species typically encounters.\n\nCowie (1998) pushes on this idea from another direction. Drawing on\nSocrates\u2019 famous interaction with the slave boy in Plato\u2019s\nMeno, Cowie notes that the boy\u2019s knowledge of geometry is\nregarded as innate simply because it developed in an (arguably)\ninformationally impoverished environment. It makes no difference\nwhether the slave boy\u2019s interaction with Socrates qualifies as a\nnormal environment or not. Hence, environmental invariance is not\nconnected, she argues, to intuitive judgments of innateness (see\nKhalidi 2002 for a discussion of this argument).\n",
