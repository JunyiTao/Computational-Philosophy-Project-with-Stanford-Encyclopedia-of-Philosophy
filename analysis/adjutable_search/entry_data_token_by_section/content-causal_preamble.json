    "main_text": "\n\nCausal theories of mental content attempt to explain how thoughts can\nbe about things. They attempt to explain how one can think about, for\nexample, dogs. These theories begin with the idea that there are\nmental representations and that thoughts are meaningful in virtue of a\ncausal connection between a mental representation and some part of the\nworld that is represented. In other words, the point of departure for\nthese theories is that thoughts of dogs are about dogs because dogs\ncause the mental representations of dogs.\n",
