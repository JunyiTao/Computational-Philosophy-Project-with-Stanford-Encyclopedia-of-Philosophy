    "main_text": "Self-Love and Benevolence\n5. Self-Love and Benevolence\n\nAs previously noted, Butler discusses two other important constituents\nof human nature in addition to conscience and the particular passions:\nself-love and benevolence. Butler\u2019s extremely influential\ndismissal of psychological egoism was central to his analysis of\nself-love. C. D. Broad claimed that \u201che killed the theory so\nthoroughly that he sometimes seems to the modern reader to be flogging\ndead horses\u201d (Broad 1930, 55). For Butler the kind of egoism\nexemplified by Hobbes \u2014 \u201cthe selfish theory\u201d in\neighteenth-century parlance \u2014 rests on a failure to distinguish\nprinciples from passions (for context see Maurer 2019). There is a\ntrivial sense in which all of our passions are our own and the\npleasure we have in discharging or pursuing any passion is\n\u201cself\u201d love. But it is also uninteresting: we can\u2019t\nconclude much from the fact that every passion we take pleasure in is\nour passion. We certainly can\u2019t conclude that human beings are\nalways motivated by selfishness. That selfish theorists thought we\ncould was due in part to their confusing the \u201cownership of an\nimpulse with its object\u201d (Broad 1930, 65)\u2014the inference\nfrom that the passions are ours to that we are the objects of the\npassions. Although the passions belong to us it does not therefore\nfollow that our \u201cself,\u201d or our self-gratification, is the\nobject of the passion.\n\nOne of the most discussed passages from the Sermons, the so-called\n\u201cstone argument\u201d (Sober 1992) has often been taken as an\nargument against psychological hedonism. In the passage Butler\npurports to establish that \u201call particular appetites and\npassions are towards external things themselves, distinct from the\npleasure arising from them\u201d due to the fact \u201cthat there\ncould not be this pleasure, were it not for that prior suitableness\nbetween the object and the passion\u201d (Sermon XI \u00a76). Butler\nthen concludes were this not the case then \u201cthere could be no\nenjoyment or delight from one thing more than another, from eating\nfood more than from swallowing a stone, if there were not an affection\nor appetite to one thing more than another\u201d (Sermon XI \u00a76).\nThe upshot of the stone argument seems to be that appetites and\npassions must have something more than, or other than, pleasure as\ntheir object. That said not everyone has seen Butler\u2019s argument\nas valid (Penelhum 1985; Henson 1988; Sober 1992; Tilley 2018) and\nthere is disagreement on what exactly it is an argument against.\n\nThese mistakes are connected to another: confusing the principle of\nself-love, which has the happiness of the self as its object, with\nparticular passions and desires. Once we recognize that \u201cthe\npain of hunger and shame, and the delight from esteem, are no more\nself-love than they are any thing in the world\u201d (Sermon I, Note\n3) \u2014 they are particular passions and desires with particular\nobjects \u2014 we see that from the fact that we take pleasure in our\npassions and that they are our passions it does not follow that we are\nguided by selfish principles. Passions do make us happy or unhappy.\nBut that we have an interest in being happy or unhappy is distinct\nfrom the particular passions, their objects, or the happiness arising\nfrom the passions \u2014 although it may be a reason to prefer one\npassion over another. This was connected to Butler\u2019s belief that\npassions are not interested in themselves. They have particular ends\nwhereas self-love is our general interest in securing our\nhappiness.\n\nLike Shaftesbury and Francis Hutcheson, Butler thought it prima facie\nevident that human beings had benevolent motivations, and he thought\nit obvious that these benevolent motivations could make us happy and\nbe consistent with self-interest. The onus was on advocates of the\nselfish theory to provide a compelling case against. Butler placed\nmore stress on the exceptions than Shaftesbury had and stressed that\nthey are \u201cnaturally\u201d consistent, i.e. that they are\nconsistent in our nature and the natural course of things although the\nunnatural and intemperate actions of others might interfere locally\n(Analogy III \u00a75; \u00a727). He saw Hobbes\u2019\nreduction of all other-directed motivations -- such as compassion --\nto selfish motivations in disguise to deny an evident matter of fact\nfor theoretical reasons, i.e. in order to reconcile benevolence and\ncompassion with Hobbes\u2019 general hypothesis about human nature.\nBut once a compassionate motivation is recast as a selfish motivation,\nfor Hobbes as a type of fear, it conflicts with the sense of the term\nbeing explained to the point that it engenders contradiction. For\nexample: we feel compassion strongly towards our friends. If\ncompassion were a fear then we would fear our friends strongly, which\nseems to conflict with the agreed use of the word\n\u201ccompassion.\u201d\n\nWhich was not to deny of course that people act from selfishness,\nself-partiality, and confused self-interest. Selfishness and\nself-partiality often mix with benevolent motivations to give rise to\nbenevolent and even compassionate actions (Sermon V Note 1). Unlike\nShaftesbury and Hutcheson, Butler stressed that human beings often act\nfrom mixed and opaque motives (as will be discussed in Section 6). But\nthe existence of mixed motivations presumes non-interested motivations\nwith which selfishness is mixed, not the reducibility of all\nmotivations to selfishness or self-partiality. This also has the\nvirtue of being a simpler explanation than the more complicated\nselfish motivations offered by Hobbes\u2019 theory.\n\nAccording to Butler, once clarified self-love is properly understood\nas \u201cregard to our own Interest, Happiness, and private\nGood\u201d (Sermon IX \u00a78). Butler further suggests that\nself-love can be pursued better and worse, and that it is best\nreflected on via reason in a cool and impartial way. By\n\u201ccool\u201d Butler understood \u201cimpartial\u201d in the\nsense of not being swayed away from the truth by particular loves and\nhates or by self-partiality. And by \u201creason\u201d Butler\nunderstood the faculty of discerning truth (Sermon XIII \u00a75).\nSelf-love worked best and our interest was best served when we\nimpartially seek what is truly in our interest. When understood in\nthis way it can clearly suggest actions that conflict with\nselfishness. Conversely resolute selfishness and self-partiality are\nnot the best course for self-love. To satisfy a particular desire may\nor may not make us happy in either the short or long-term and may not\neduce to our private good. And although satisfying a desire may make\nus happy, and all of our happiness may be the result of particular\npassions, no particular passion has happiness in general as its\nobject.\n\nConversely we might fruitlessly seek our interest but have no\nparticular object in mind. Or we might obsess over our interest to\nsuch a degree that we would continually be exercising the principle of\nself-love but not actually satisfying our particular passions and\nconsequently not be happy. \u201cHappiness consists in the\nGratification of certain Affections, Appetites, Passions, with Objects\nwhich are by Nature adapted to them,\u201d (Sermon IX \u00a716).\nSelf-love is a principle governing actions leading to the satisfaction\nor avoidance of the particular passions. Both self-love and the\nparticular passions are necessary for the proper natural functioning\nof human beings.\n\nOnce self-love is distinguished from selfishness, self-partiality and\nthe particular passions it becomes clearer that the conflict between\nself-love and benevolence is mostly an illusion when considered in the\nlong term. Particular passions like compassion are perfectly\nconsistent with self-love, indeed Butler held that to take pleasure in\nbenevolent and virtuous acts and view them as part of one\u2019s\nhappiness is \u201citself the Temper of Satisfaction and\nEnjoyment.\u201d In the Analogy, Butler provided further\narguments that the natural tendency of virtue was the reward of\nhappiness, and the natural punishment for vice, misery. We often fail\nto see this natural tendency because we focus on accidents or a\nlimited range of examples to the detriment of the consistent long-term\ntendencies. Butler suggested a thought experiment of a monarchy run on\nvirtuous principles (Analogy III \u00a720) and argued that it\nwould tend to be happier and more powerful than other regimes if\nallowed to flourish, eventually becoming a universal monarchy. The\nnatural tendency of happiness, power, and virtue all coincide in its\nflourishing, growth, and moral governance. And happiness as coupled to\nvirtue in this life points to happiness as the consistent reward for\nvirtue in the next when accidents do not threaten to derail the\nnatural tendency.\n\nWhich is not to suggest that conscience, virtue, and self-love are\nidentical, although Butler connected them very deeply (Frey 1992 and\nn.p.). Although virtue tends to coincide with interest it tends to\ncoincide because a virtuous life is a life with the right balance of\nbenevolent passions and dispositions to make one happy and a life\nwhich responds to the unchanging and immediate moral authority of\nconscience \u2013 although they are approved of and motivated by\nself-love as well.\n\nButler uses benevolence mainly to refer to a particular passion or a\ncluster of passions (McNaughton 1992), although sometimes he also\nrefers to it and cognate terms (\u201clove of thy neighbor\u201d) as\nprinciples that might have particular passions as their objects. There\nis still a fair amount of scholarly disagreement as to which sense is\nmore central in Butler\u2019s arguments (nicely summarized in Irwin\n2008). Benevolence as a particular passion, like ambition or revenge,\nis never interested or disinterested in and of itself. It is only\ninterested or disinterested in so far as it is guided by or in\naccordance with our self-love. Acting in a benevolent manner might\nmake us happy. Indeed it seems to be the case that benevolent actions\nand affections often do make people happy. And we might initially\ndecide to gratify the passions of benevolence from self-love. But the\npassions themselves have no more or less connection to interest than\nany other passion does.\n\nNot being made happy by benevolent actions would point to a defect of\ntemper or a lack of balance in one\u2019s nature if the result was\ndiminished happiness and going against the dictates of conscience. As\nnoted, for both Butler and Shaftesbury, self-love and virtue converge\nwhen properly understood. But importantly according to Butler,\nShaftesbury erred in not recognizing that they could conflict in\nparticular cases, and if they did conflict the distinctive authority\nof conscience would trump our apparent prudential motivations. This\ndid not mean that our general interest conflicted with conscience, but\nrather that local prudential information could give reasons for\nparticular reasons for action that conflicted with conscience.\n\nThere is also some (more contested) evidence that Butler thought of\nbenevolence as a ruling principle (Rorty 1978). Butler referred to the\ngeneral principle of charity or \u201clove of our neighbor as\nthyself\u201d as a virtuous principle or as the reason-guided\nendeavor to promote the happiness of proximate others to the same\ndegree that one attempts to promote one\u2019s own good (although he\nalso identified \u201clove of neighbor\u201d with the particular\npassion of compassion). This was a regulating principle of action,\nperhaps distinct from benevolent passions. Butler suggested in Sermon\nIX that we have a fundamental obligation to the happiness of sensible\ncreatures other than ourselves insofar as they are capable of pleasure\nand pain, an obligation that can only be ignored in order to bring\nabout greater happiness (to be further discussed in Section 6).\nAlthough this appears to be a fundamental moral obligation to maximize\nwelfare a few years later Butler strongly criticized theories on which\nthe overall happiness is what makes an action good or evil and argued\nthat our conscience holds actions to be morally good or bad\nindependent of the expected or actual consequences for happiness\n(\u201cDissertation,\u201d \u00a75). Most of the secondary\nliterature takes Butler to generally be an anti-utilitarian (but see\nLouden 1995 and in a different way see Frey 1992, for a historical\noverview of interpretations see Garrett 2019), but there is\ndisagreement as to whether Butler held a consistent position or\nchanged his mind (see McPherson 1948\u20139). Some even argue that he\nmight be able to embrace a form of consequentialism (see McNaughton\n2017).\n\nFinally, Butler claimed that benevolence is the whole of virtue in\nSermon XII, although he qualified the claim later in Sermon XII and\nqualified it even more strongly in the \u201cDissertation on\nVirtue.\u201d Butler did not mean that to act benevolently in each\nand every action was the entirety of virtue, for example as we shall\nsee in the next section moral resentment was an appropriate attitude\nfor a virtuous agent. Rather he meant that to act according to and to\nbe motivated by the principle of loving one\u2019s neighbor generally\nleads to virtuous and morally approved actions. Although\nself-partiality tends in the opposite direction, benevolence offsets\nthis tendency and brings benevolent and self-partial affections in\nproper proportion. Conversely self-partiality brings benevolence in\nline with self-love such that it balances properly in our nature.\n\nAccording to Butler when we approve of virtue in an agent this gives\nrise to benevolence towards the agent. The ultimate object of this\nlove of benevolent moral agents is our love of God, the most\nbenevolent agent. In stressing the continuity between love of neighbor\nand love of God, Butler also stressed the continuity between our\napproval of moral agents and natural theology. Finally, to have a\ncharacter such that benevolent actions make one happy is normally to\nhave a character that encompasses all of the virtues.\n",
