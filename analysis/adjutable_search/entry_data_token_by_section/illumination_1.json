    "main_text": "The Ancient Background\n2. The Ancient Background\n\n\nWhat follows is by no means a comprehensive survey. Still, it seems\nuseful to begin near the beginning, with this remark by Socrates from\nthe Apology: \nI have a divine or spiritual sign which Meletus has\nridiculed in his deposition. This began when I was a child. It is a\nvoice, and whenever it speaks it turns me away from something I am\nabout to do, but it never encourages me to do anything (31d, tr.\nGrube).\n\n\nThis appears to be an entirely straightforward expression of a theory\nof divine illumination. It is not clear who is providing the\nillumination. Apuleius (fl. 150 CE) would later identify the source as\na certain kind of friendly demon, and argue that it was only fitting\nfor Socrates, the most perfect of all human beings, to receive such\nillumination (De deo Socratis, XVII\u2013XIX). (This idea that\nillumination comes to those who deserve it would be proposed by\nAugustine as well [e.g., De magistro 11.38], but abandoned in\nhis later writings as untenable.) As one might expect from Socrates,\nhis illumination seems restricted to the moral sphere. Its form is\nunclear: is it propositional? (see Phaedrus 242bc) Is it\nmerely the pang of conscience? (For discussion of these and other\nquestions, see e.g. the papers collected in Destr\u00e9e and Smith\n2005.) Whatever the details, Socrates is explicitly describing a kind\nof cognitive guidance that has a \u201cdivine or spiritual\u201d source. The\npassage may be an embarrassment to classicists, but it surely belongs\nin the same tradition as later medieval endorsements of\nillumination. \n\n\nNot all appeals to the divine involve this sort of direct\ncommunication. (Indeed, Socrates\u2019s reference to a \u201cvoice\u201d is quite\nextraordinary.) But the leading figures in ancient Greek philosophy\nwere equally committed to some kind of divine role in cognition.\nPlato\u2019s theory of recollection presupposes that the human mind somehow\nhas built into it a grasp of the Forms, suggesting that at some point\nthe soul must have received some kind of illumination. Indeed, Plato\u2019s\narguments for recollection anticipate the two lines along which\nmedieval views would later develop. The Meno focuses on a\npriori, rational insight, as illustrated by the slave\u2019s ability to see\nfor himself the validity of a geometrical proof. The Phaedo in\ncontrast focuses on universal properties \u2014 Equality, for instance, as\ncompared with two equal sticks (74a) \u2014 contrasting the changeable\nimperfection of the physical world with the exemplary perfection of the\nForms. Medieval philosophers from Augustine on, although largely\nlacking in firsthand knowledge of Plato, would argue for illumination\nalong both of these lines.\n\n\nAristotle too seems to invoke the divine. He describes the active\nintellect in this way:\nThis intellect is separate, unaffected, and unmixed, being\nin essence activity\u2026. It is not the case that it sometimes thinks and\nat other times not. In separation it is just what it is, and this alone\nis immortal and eternal (De anima III 5,\n430a17\u201323).\n\n\nThere is of course unending controversy over the meaning of this text.\nOne very common reading, in ancient times and our own, is that this\nactive intellect is something divine, not a human faculty at all. If\none then makes the further, natural assumption that the active\nintellect participates in ordinary human cognition, then Aristotle\nwould clearly be committed to a version of divine illumination. (One\nshould, however, be cautious in supposing that Aristotle\u2019s nous\npoietikos plays anything like the role played by the scholastic\nintellectus agens. See Haldane 1992.) Not everyone has been\npersuaded that this active intellect is something literally separate\nand divine. But even if one supposes that the active intellect is a\npart of the human soul, it is nevertheless difficult to avoid the\nsuspicion that some sort of special divine influence is at work.\nEverything in the passage cries out for some sort of supernatural\nelement in human cognition. \n\n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias (fl. 200 CE) was influential in pushing the\nseparate-and-divine reading of De anima III.5, and Islamic\nphilosophers (most notably Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 [980\u20131037] and Ibn Rushd\n[c.1126\u2013c.1198]) would later follow suit. Themistius (4th century CE),\nin contrast, championed the part-of-soul reading, and Thomas Aquinas\n(1225\u20131274) would second this interpretation. A full treatment of this\ntopic would cover the later Aristotelian and Platonic traditions, Greek\nand Islamic. But here I will focus exclusively on the Latin West, where\nit was Augustine who played the decisive role in formulating the\ndoctrine of illumination. (For a useful survey of ancient and medieval\nAristotelian accounts of agent intellect, see Brentano 1992. On the\nlater Platonic tradition, see Gersh 1978. The Islamic tradition\ndeserves a full essay in its own right, covering not just names well\nknown in the Latin West, but also figures like Suhrawardi and Mulla\nSadra, central figures in the Islamic illuminationist tradition [see\nWalbridge 2005].)\n",
