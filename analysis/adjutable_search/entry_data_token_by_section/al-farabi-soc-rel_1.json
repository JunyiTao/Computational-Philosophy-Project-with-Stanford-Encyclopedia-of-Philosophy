Occasionally, he distinguishes between\n\u201cearthly\u201d and \u201cultimate felicity\u201d\n(Attainment i, 1: 13), however, from the majority of his\nwritings it is clear that happiness in the strict sense of the word,\nthat is, as the concomitant of the highest human perfection, is\nultimate\n felicity.[3]\n Yet, in contrast to Aristotle\u2019s notion of eudaimonia,\nal-Farabi\u2019s ultimate happiness is a state associated with the\nafterlife, when, according to his theory of the soul, the soul has\nseparated from the body (see the entry on\n al-Farabi\u2019s psychology).\n The achievement of this state is contingent upon a number of\n preconditions.[4]\n However, before these preconditions can be broached (see\n section 2.2),\n further scrutiny of al-Farabi\u2019s concepts of human perfection\nand the afterlife is required.\n\nHuman perfection is defined by humanity\u2019s place within the\ncosmic order. Prior to death, human beings are hybrids\u2014corporeal\nentities, on the one hand, yet also immaterial, on the other, due to\ntheir intellects, that is, the rational faculty of their souls which\ncan survive death\u2014and as such exposed to two sets of powers.\nJust like every other inhabitant of the sublunary\n world,[5]\n human beings are subject to the natural laws determining corporeal\nsubstances. In contrast, however, to all the other species belonging\nto the sphere of generation and corruption, human beings moreover\nexperience a certain influence by the so-called \u2018active\nintellect\u2019, an immaterial, incorruptible, supralunary entity\nwhose existence is pure\n thinking.[6]\n This active intellect does not affect the body of a human being, but\nrather her intellect and imagination, i.e., those psychic faculties\ninvolved in thinking. The most fundamental influence which the active\nintellect exerts on the human soul consists in, first, the provision\nand, second, the basic \u2018formatting\u2019 of the rational\nfaculty:\n\n\n\u2026 [the active intellect] gives the human being a faculty and a\nprinciple by which to strive, or by which the human being is able to\nstrive on his own for the rest of the perfections that remain for him.\nThat principle is the primary sciences and the primary intelligibles\nattained in the rational part of the soul. (Political Regime\nB, 1, 68: 62)\n\n\nOnly due to these \u201cprimary sciences\u201d and \u201cprimary\nintelligibles\u201d can human beings think in an abstract and\nuniversal fashion and thus acquire knowledge about what there\n is.[7]\n And precisely in the realization of this activity, i.e., thinking,\nand its perfection\u2014ideally, the attainment of its most sublime\nlevel, i.e., science\u2014consists humanity\u2019s telos.\nHuman beings, hence, are born with the natural obligation to perfect\ntheir rational faculty. While they are equipped by the active\nintellect with this faculty and the principles of thought, their task\nconsists in actualizing this potential, i.e., their intellects,\n\u201cby which a human being is a human being\u201d (Political\nRegime A, 2, 8: 32). Becoming an intellect in actuality, just\nlike the active intellect and the other separate intelligences,\ntherefore, constitutes humanity\u2019s perfection. Once a human being\nreaches this level of perfection, she acquires the state of ultimate\nhappiness:\n\n\nWhen the rational faculty attains to being an intellect in actuality,\nthat intellect it now is in actuality also becomes similar to the\nseparate things and it intellects its essence that is [now] intellect\nin actuality. \u2026. Through this, it becomes such as to be in the\nrank of the active intellect. And when a human being obtains this\nrank, his happiness is perfected. (Political Regime A, 2, 8:\n33; square brackets thus in the\n translation)[8]\n\n\nAcross al-Farabi\u2019s various writings, it remains unclear whether\nthis stage of ultimate felicity can already be reached during\none\u2019s lifetime, when the soul is still linked with the human\nbody, or only in the hereafter, once the soul has separated from the\nbody due to this latter\u2019s\n death.[9]\n Still, in striking contrast to Islamic teachings, al-Farabi is\nconvinced that the afterlife is exclusively psychic or rather\nintellectual. In his thought there is no room for corporeal\nresurrection. Instead, the felicity of the hereafter, according to\nhim, means purely intellectual pleasures, a state, however, which\nrequires preparation during one\u2019s lifetime, a state, moreover,\nwhich allows for individual differences. In function of the excellence\nan individual has achieved during her life, the felicity of her\nafterlife will be greater or lesser. This excellence now, on\nal-Farabi\u2019s account, can be measured against a number of\n\u2018natural duties\u2019, prerequisite for the attainment of\nhappiness, but differentiated in accordance with the individual\ncitizens\u2019 natural endowments:\n\n\nThe people of the excellent city have things in common which they all\nperform and comprehend, and other things which each class knows and\ndoes on its own. Each of these people reaches the state of felicity by\nprecisely these two things \u2026. The same is true of the actions\nby which felicity is attained: the more they increase and are repeated\n\u2026, the stronger and more excellent and more perfect becomes the\nsoul \u2026, until it arrives at that stage of perfection in which\nit can dispense with matter so that it becomes independent of it\n \u2026.[10]\n |4: 265| When one generation passes away, their bodies cease to exist\nand their souls are released and become happy and when other people\nsucceed them in their ranks \u2026, they occupy in their turn the\nsame ranks in felicity as those who passed away before, and each joins\nthose who resemble him in species, quantity and quality. \u2026 |5:\n267| The kinds of felicity are unequal in excellence and differ in\nthree ways, in species, quantity and quality \u2026. (Perfect\nState V, 16, 2: 261\u20133; 4: 265; 5:\n 267)[11]\n\n\nTrue individual happiness, as al-Farabi sees it, thus turns out to be\na peculiar blend of Aristotelian, Platonic, and Neoplatonic elements.\nIt simultaneously embraces the idea of the individual felicity\nattained by the philosophers, the notion of a purification and,\nultimately, deification of the human soul, and a theory of intellect\nwhich largely intertwines cosmic and epistemic dimensions. While the\njust-quoted passage from the Perfect State shows that, beyond\nthe knowledge of certain things, particular actions must be performed\nas a precondition for the attainment of individual happiness,\nal-Farabi\u2019s emphasis on cognition cannot be overestimated. For,\nwhatever he has in mind regarding activities, from the above it is\nclear that the human telos is located at the level of\nrationality. Happiness, consequently, consists in the\nas-perfect-as-possible assimilation of the human soul to the active\nintellect, whose unique activity is thinking.\n\nThis being said, a number of questions remain open and must be\naddressed in what follows: first, the things every citizen of the\nmadina is expected to know; second, the role activities play\nin the attainment of individual felicity; and, third, how\nal-Farabi\u2019s just-discussed concept of happiness squares with his\ndistinction between different \u201cclasses\u201d of citizens as\nwell as various degrees of felicity.\n",
