    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Intellectual Background\n1. Mill\u2019s Intellectual Background\n\nOne cannot properly appreciate the development of Mill\u2019s moral\nand political philosophy without some understanding of his\nintellectual background. Mill was raised in the tradition of\nPhilosophical Radicalism, made famous by Jeremy Bentham\n(1748\u20131832), John Austin (1790\u20131859), and his father James\nMill (1773\u20131836), which applied utilitarian principles in a\nself-conscious and systematic way to issues of institutional design\nand social reform. Utilitarianism assesses actions and institutions in\nterms of their effects on human happiness and enjoins us to perform\nactions and design institutions so that they promote\u2014in one\nformulation, maximize\u2014human happiness. Utilitarianism was a\nprogressive doctrine historically, principally because of its\nuniversal scope\u2014its insistence that everyone\u2019s\nhappiness matters\u2014and its egalitarian conception of\nimpartiality\u2014its insistence that everyone\u2019s happiness\nmatters equally. Because of these general characteristics of\nutilitarianism, the Radicals\u2019 application of utilitarian\nprinciples to social institutions tended to challenge traditional\ninstitutions of class and privilege and support egalitarian\nreforms.\n\nAs documented in his Autobiography (1873), Mill was groomed\nfrom birth by his father to become the ultimate Victorian intellectual\nand utilitarian reformer. As part of this apprenticeship, Mill was\nexposed to an extremely demanding education, shaped by utilitarian\nprinciples. While Mill followed the strict intellectual regimen laid\ndown by his father for many years, he suffered a profound intellectual\nand emotional crisis in the period 1826\u20131830. Mill\u2019s\nrecovery was assisted by friendships he formed with Thomas Carlyle and\nSamuel Coleridge, who introduced him to ideas and texts from the\nRomantic and Conservative traditions. As Mill emerged from his\ndepression, he became more concerned with the development of\nwell-rounded individuals and with the role of feeling, culture, and\ncreativity in the happiness of individuals (see Capaldi 2004).\n\nThough Mill never renounced the liberal and utilitarian tradition and\nmission that he inherited from his father, his mental crisis and\nrecovery greatly influenced his interpretation of this tradition. He\nbecame critical of the moral psychology of Bentham and his father and\nof some of the social theory underlying their plans for reform. It is\narguable that Mill tends to downplay the significance of his\ninnovations and to underestimate the intellectual discontinuities\nbetween himself and his father. One measure of the extent of\nMill\u2019s departure from the views of Bentham and James Mill is\nthat Mill\u2019s father came to view him as a defector from the\nutilitarian cause (Autobiography 189). We need to try to\nunderstand the extent of the transformation Mill brings to the\nutilitarian and liberal principles of the Radicals.\n",
