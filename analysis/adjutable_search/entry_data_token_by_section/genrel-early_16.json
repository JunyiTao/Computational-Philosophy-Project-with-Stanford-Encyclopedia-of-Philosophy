Holding that\ndirect\u2014evident, in the sense of the\nWesensschau of Husserlian phenomenoloy\u2014comparisons of\nlength or duration could be made at near-by points of spacetime, but\nnot, as the Riemannian geometry of Einstein\u2019s theory allowed,\n\u201cat a distance\u201d, Weyl discovered an expanded geometry with\nadditional terms that, following Einstein\u2019s example, he simply\nformally identified with the potentials of the electromagnetic field.\nFrom these, the electromagnetic field strengths can be immediately\nderived. Choosing an action integral to obtain both the homogeneous\nand the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations as well as Einstein\u2019s\ngravitational theory, Weyl could express electromagnetism as well as\ngravitation solely within the confines of a spacetime geometry. As no\nother interactions were definitely known to occur, Weyl proudly\ndeclared that the concepts of geometry and physics were the same.\nHence, everything in the physical world was a manifestation of\nspacetime geometry.\n\n\n(The) distinction between geometry and physics is an error, physics\nextends not at all beyond geometry: the world is a \\((3+1)\\)\ndimensional metrical manifold, and all physical phenomena transpiring\nin it are only modes of expression of the metric field, \u2026.\n(M)atter itself is dissolved in \u201cmetric\u201d and is not\nsomething substantial that in addition exists \u201cin\u201d metric\nspace. (1919: 115\u2013116, translation by the author)\n\n\nBy the winter of 1919\u20131920, for both physical and philosophical\nreasons (the latter having to do with his largely positive reaction to\nBrouwer\u2019s intuitionist views about the mathematical continuum,\nin particular, the continuum of spacetime\u2014see Mancosu &\nRyckman 2005), Weyl (1920) surrendered the belief, expressed here,\nthat matter, with its corpuscular structure, might be derived within\nspacetime geometry. Thus he gave up the Holy Grail of the nascent\nunified field theory program almost before it had begun. Nonetheless,\nhe actively defended his theory well into the 1920s, essentially on\nthe grounds of Husserlian transcendental phenomenology, that his\ngeometry and its central principle, \u201cthe epistemological\nprinciple of relativity of magnitude\u201d comprised a superior\nepistemological framework for general relativity. Weyl\u2019s\npostulate of a \u201cpure infinitesimal\u201d non-Riemannian metric\nfor spacetime allowed the \u201cgauge\u201d (by which Weyl meant a\nscale of length; the term has a different meaning today) to vary at\neach spacetime point. But it met with intense criticism. No\nobservation spoke in favor of it; to the contrary, Einstein pointed\nout that according to Weyl\u2019s theory, the atomic spectra of the\nchemical elements should not be stable, as indeed they are observed to\nbe. Although Weyl responded to this objection forcefully, and with\nsome subtlety (Weyl 1923a), he was able to persuade neither Einstein,\nnor any other leading relativity physicist, with the exception of\nEddington. However, the idea of requiring gauge invariance of\nfundamental physical laws was revived and vindicated by Weyl himself\nin a different form later on (Weyl 1929; see Ryckman 2005: chs. 5\n& 6; O\u2019Raifeartaigh 1997; Scholz 2001, 2004; Afriat 2017,\nOther Internet Resources).\n",
