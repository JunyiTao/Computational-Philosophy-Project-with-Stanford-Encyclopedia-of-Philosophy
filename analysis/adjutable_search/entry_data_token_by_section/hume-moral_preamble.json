    "main_text": "\n\n\nHume\u2019s position in ethics, which is based on his\n empiricist theory of the mind,\n is best known for asserting four theses: (1) Reason alone\ncannot be a motive to the will, but rather is the\n \u201cslave of the passions\u201d (see\n Section 3)  \n (2) Moral distinctions are not derived from reason (see\n Section 4).\n (3) Moral distinctions are derived from the moral sentiments: feelings of\napproval (esteem, praise) and disapproval (blame) felt by spectators\nwho contemplate a character trait or action (see\n Section 7). \n (4) While some virtues and vices are natural (see\n Section 13),\n others, including justice, are artificial (see\n Section 9).\n There is heated debate about what Hume intends by each of these\ntheses and how he argues for them. He articulates and defends them within the broader \ncontext of his metaethics and his ethic of virtue and\nvice.\n\n\nHume\u2019s main ethical writings are Book 3 of his Treatise of Human\nNature, \u201cOf Morals\u201d (which builds on Book 2, \u201cOf\nthe Passions\u201d), his Enquiry concerning the Principles of\nMorals, and some of his Essays. In part the moral\nEnquiry simply recasts central ideas from the moral part of\nthe Treatise in a more accessible style; but there are\nimportant differences. The ethical positions and arguments of the\nTreatise are set out below, noting where the moral\nEnquiry agrees; differences between the Enquiry and\nthe Treatise are discussed afterwards.\n",
