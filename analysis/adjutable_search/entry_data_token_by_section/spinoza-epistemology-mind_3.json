For him knowledge is not\nmerely a theoretical achievement, as if we were solving\nconceptual puzzles for their own sake. For Spinoza, what is at stake\nin understanding anything, including thinking and knowledge, is a\nwhole slew of practical goods: freedom, virtue, blessedness.\nOf the infinity of knowable things, Spinoza writes, he wants to write\nonly about \u201cthose that can lead us, by the hand, as it were, to\nthe knowledge of the human Mind and its highest blessedness\u201d\n(E2pref).\n",
