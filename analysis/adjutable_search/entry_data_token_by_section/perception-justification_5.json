    "main_text": "Theories of Experience || Degreed Perception\n1.5 Degreed Perception\n\nWe have spoken so far about experiences justifying beliefs in an all\nor nothing way. As Munton 2016 reminds us, visual experiences can\njustify the same belief to differing degrees. For example, suppose you\nare looking outside at the park on a foggy and snowy morning, and\ngradually get a better view of a new snowman as the fog clears. Here\nyour successive visual experiences of the snowman justify your belief\nthat there is a snowman in the park more and more as the fog clears.\nPerceptual justification comes in degrees.\n\nA caution about how to set up the issue is in order. If you think that\nperceptual justification is only binary and does not come in degrees,\nyou should avoid the following common formulation of that sort of\nview: either your experience justifies a belief that there is a\nsnowman in the park or it does not. We can all agree that the law of\nexcluded middle applies to perceptual justification, that\ndoesn\u2019t yet rule out the possibility that perceptual\njustification comes in degrees. For example, perhaps your experience\njustifies a belief when the degree of justification it gives is\nsufficiently high, and otherwise not. This is a scenario in which your\nexperience either justifies a belief or it does not, as well as a\nscenario where perceptual justification comes in degrees.\n\nAccording to Munton, we can now draw a conclusion about the nature of\nvisual experiences, in effect using the template we have surveyed so\nfar (I focus on Munton\u2019s argument because she puts epistemology\nfront and center. A related argument by Morrison 2016 instead focuses\non variations in what happens when we form opinions by completely\ntrusting our experiences, but this argument departs from psychology\nrather than epistemology).\n\nAs a first pass we can try the following:\n\nEpistemology2 Our experiences justify beliefs about the external\nworld to varying degrees.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link6 If our experiences justify beliefs about the\nexternal world to varying degrees, then our experiences are themselves\ndegreed.\n\nSo,\n\nMind3 Our experiences are themselves degreed.\n\nThe conclusion that experiences are degreed is striking and important,\nbut it can be elaborated in quite different ways.\n\nOne choice point is where to locate potential variation in degrees.\nOne option would be in the contents of the experiences, another would\nbe in the mental relation we bear to contents or to the world in\nhaving an experience (variation in principle could be located in the\nvehicles of experiences as well or somewhere else). A further choice\npoint is about how to understand variations in degrees of experiences.\nA tempting option is to piggyback on probabilistic theorizing about\ncredences or degrees of belief (but bear in mind that in principle\nexperiences could be degreed without being degreed in a probabilistic\nway). The idea here is to cash out the idea that experiences are\ndegreed in a similar way to how philosophers cash out the idea that\ncredences are degreed (without necessarily saying that experiences\nsimply are credences). So just as you might have a higher credence\nthat the 4-sided die will land 4 than the 6-sided die might land 4,\nperhaps you also have a higher visual credence that there is a snowman\nout there when the fog is lighter, as opposed to when the fog is\nheavier. Now, how to understand credences themselves is open to\ndispute, where again dimensions of variation might be located in\ndiffering mental relations to the content that the die will land 4, or\npotentially instead in different contents concerning 1/6 probabilities\nas opposed to 1/6 probabilities. Also, even if credences are\nthemselves best understood in probabilistic terms, that is not yet to\nsay that credences are best understood specifically in Bayesian terms.\nSo degreed views of experience aren\u2019t forced to commit\nspecifically to Bayesian views of perception (for more on\nprobabilistic views of perception, often focusing more on the\nprocesses leading to perception rather than what is generated by those\nprocesses, see Hohwy 2013, Rescorla 2015, Siegel 2020, or Vance 2021).\nUnderstanding degreed experiences along the lines of credences opens a\nwide menu of options. \n\nFor a final complication, note that there is extensive debate about\nthe relation between traditionally conceived beliefs and credences.\nOne eliminativist option ultimately denies that there are beliefs,\nreplacing them with credences. Other approaches keep both beliefs and\ncredences in the picture, and understand beliefs in terms of\ncredences, or credences in terms of belief, or neither in terms of the\nother (see section 4 of SEP entry on formal representations of\nbelief). Likewise, once one has admitted experiences that are degreed\nsomehow in the manner of credences, one might at the same time still\nallow for other experiences more like traditionally understood\nbeliefs. So there is now room for the questions about the relation\nbetween beliefs and credences to play out in the case of experiences\nthat are structured along the lines of beliefs vs. degreed experiences\nstructured along the lines of credences. Perhaps there only are\ndegreed experiences structured like credences, or perhaps there are\nalso experiences structured like beliefs, where we can ask whether\neither of the two entities has explanatory priority in relation to the\nother. \n\nIn sum, understanding experiences as being degreed in the manner of\ncredences is a fascinating line of research, but also a multi-pronged\none given the extent range of questions about credences.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve seen some of the possibilities that arise if\nexperiences are degreed, the question remains of whether the epistemic\nargument above establishes that any of them is actual.\n\nIn order to make the needed link from epistemology to mind plausible,\nthe linking premise and the rest of the argument need to be refined\nright away. The strategy is to trace variation of degrees in\njustification to variations of degrees in experience, but rival\ncandidates for explaining the variation need to be blocked. For all we\nhave said so far, the variation in degrees of justification could be\ntraced not to experiences, but rather to differing degrees of\njustification to believe that your experiences are trustworthy\n(depending on the conditions of fog).\n\nTo block a role for differences in your background beliefs, Munton in\neffect focuses on immediate justification for your experiences (using\nthe terminology of \u201cdirect\u201d justification). This gives us\nthe following\n\nEpistemology3 Our experiences immediately justify beliefs about\nthe external world to varying degrees.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link6 If our experiences immediately justify\nbeliefs about the external world to varying degrees, then our\nexperiences are themselves degreed.\n\nSo,\n\nMind3 Our experiences are themselves degreed.\n\nEven given these refinements, rival explanations still need to be\nblocked. For example, perhaps the new version of Epistemology is\nfalse, and experiences only provide specifically immediate\njustification in optimal cases (for discussion see Munton 2016). Or\nperhaps the new version of Link is false, and the variations in\ndegrees of justification can be explained in line with a traditional\nnon-degreed picture of what experiences are. For example, consider\nthat your experience plausibly concerns not just the potential snowman\nin the park, but also the amount of fog in the park and other aspects\nof your viewing conditions. And consider the phenomenon of defeat,\nwhere information you receive can reduce or destroy the amount of\njustification given by your experience. Given that your experience in\neffect takes a stand on the quality of your viewing conditions,\nperhaps your experiences in higher conditions of fog undermine the\ndegree of justification they supply specifically to believe a snowman\nis there. Here we might explain the variation of degrees of\njustification through variation in the experience, but through garden\nvariety non-degreed perceptual content concerning viewing conditions,\nrather than any more striking degreed character of the experiences\n(this sort of objection is discussed further in Beck 2020).\n\nWe have now surveyed the epistemic implications of some central\ntheories of experience. We have by no means covered all theories of\nexperience. Here we will simply point to further important areas to\nconsider. For discussion of na\u00efve realist theories of experience,\nand of their interaction with issues about skepticism, see the entries\non\n epistemological problems of perception\n and\n the disjunctive theory of perception.\n For discussion of how dualist theories of experience might lead to\nepiphenomenalism, where epiphenomenalism might lead to skeptical\nproblems, see the entry on\n epiphenomenalism\n (section 2.3). For discussion of the theory that experience is\nactually a special case of belief, where that theory might affect our\nunderstanding of how we base beliefs on experiences, see the entry on\n the contents of perception\n (section 2.2).\n",
