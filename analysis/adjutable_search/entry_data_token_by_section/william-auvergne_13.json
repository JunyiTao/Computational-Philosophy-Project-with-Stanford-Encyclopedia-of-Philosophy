    "main_text": "The Soul || The Incorporeality of Souls\n7.2 The Incorporeality of Souls\n\nWilliam argues at length that a soul cannot be a body, a conclusion he\napplies not just to human or rational souls, but also to those of\nplants and animals. In the case of human souls, he uses, among others,\nAvicenna\u2019s \u201cflying-man\u201d argument to establish this\npoint, arguing that a human being flying in the air who lacks and\nnever had the use of his senses would know that he exists but deny\nthat he has a body. Therefore \u201cit is necessary that he have\nbeing that does not belong to the body and, for this reason, it is\nnecessary that the soul not be a body\u201d (OO II suppl., 83a; Teske\n2000, 91) (For details, see Hasse 2000).\n\nMore generally, William argues that no body could perform the\nsoul\u2019s function of giving life to the body. For example, if a\nbody were to give life, it would itself have to be a living body, and\nthus it would itself have to have a soul that rendered it alive. This\nsoul, in turn, would have to be a living body and thus have its own\nsoul, and so on ad infinitum. Thus, the doctrine that souls\nare bodies leads to an infinite regress.\n",
