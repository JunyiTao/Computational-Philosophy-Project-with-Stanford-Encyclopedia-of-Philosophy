Psychology and Theory of Knowledge\n\nThe sources of Sharpe\u2019s psychological and epistemological\ntheories are St. Thomas, Duns Scotus, and Ockham, although the latter\nis chiefly a polemical source, as Kennedy 1969 pointed out (pp. 253\nand 270). Like Aquinas, Sharpe\n\nmaintains that the intellectual soul is the immediate form of the\nhuman body, so that the whole being of the latter totally depends on\nthe former, although souls are individuated by bodies (In De\nanima, fols. 217v-218r), and\nclaims that each man has his own intellect, arguing against\nAverroes\u2019 thesis of the unicity and separate character of the\npassive intellect for the whole human species (ibid., fols.\n210r-212v).\n\n\nLike Duns Scotus, Sharpe thinks there is not a real distinction\nbetween the soul and its intellective faculties (i.e., the active\nintellect, the passive intellect, and the will) or among the\nintellective faculties themselves, but only a formal distinction. On\nthe other hand, the soul\u2019s corporeal powers (potentiae\nincorporatae), which depend on bodily organs for their\noperations, are really distinct from the soul and from each other\n(ibid., fol. 236v).\n\nLike Aquinas and Duns Scotus, and against Ockham, Sharpe affirms that\nintelligible species are required for intellection (ibid.,\nfol. 244r). The main arguments he uses in favor of this thesis are the\nfollowing:\n\nOur mind\u2019s objects of intellection are the universal\nessences or common natures. But they cannot be present themselves to\nthe mind. Therefore, some sign of them, that is, the intelligible\nspecies, has to be directly present in the intellect.\nA universal principle of intellection is necessary in order to\nunderstand a universal object, like a common nature. The phantasm is\nparticular, since it is the mental representation of a singular\nobject. Therefore a universal species, abstracted from the phantasm,\nis required.\nIf there were no species, nothing would be retained by the\nintellect after an act of intellection. Therefore we could not\nunderstand each other, or understand more easily the second time,\nsince there would be no objects for our memory (ibid., fols.\n239v-240v).\n\n\nFinally, like Duns Scotus and Ockham, and against St. Thomas, Sharpe\nstates that our intellect can know perfectly even individual material\nthings (ibid., fol. 253r). What is more, it can know\nimmaterial beings as well, since the most general and proper object of\nour intellect is being in all its amplitude (ibid., fol.\n253v). Sharpe here distinguishes perfect knowledge from complete\nknowledge. For a perfect knowledge of something it is sufficient that\nour intellect is able to single out the object in question against\nothers by means of a proper concept. For a complete knowledge of\nsomething it is necessary that our intellect is able to list all the\nproperties, both substantial and accidental, of the object at issue.\nIt is therefore evident that we can have a perfect knowledge of\nsomething without completely knowing it, as is the case with\nindividual material things and immaterial beings (ibid., fol.\n254r-v).\n",
