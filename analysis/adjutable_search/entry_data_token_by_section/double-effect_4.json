    "main_text": "Criticisms || The Problem of Closeness\n4.2 The Problem of Closeness\n\nOne important line of criticism is known as the \u201cproblem of\ncloseness\u201d: it is difficult to distinguish between grave harms\nthat are regretfully foreseen as side effects of the agent\u2019s\nmeans and grave harms that are so close to the agent\u2019s means\nthat it seems that they must be (regretfully) intended as part of the\nagent\u2019s means. In the Abortion vs Hysterectomy example,\nit is hard to see why the death of the fetus would not be a\nregretfully foreseen side effect of saving the mother\u2019s life in\nboth cases (Boyle 1991). Or, alternatively, it is hard to see why the\ndeath of the fetus would not be regretfully intended as part of the\nphysician\u2019s means of saving the mother\u2019s life in both\ncases (Davis 1984, 110). Those who wish to apply double effect to this\nexample must provide principled grounds for distinguishing between the\ncases in this way; no clear resolution of this problem has emerged (a\nsummary of proposals is discussed by Dana Nelkin and Samuel Rickless\n2015).\n",
