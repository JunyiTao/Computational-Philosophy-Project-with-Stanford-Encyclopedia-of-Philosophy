    "main_text": "Modal theories of ability\n4. Modal theories of ability\n\nThere is a surprising disconnect between the way abilities have been\ndiscussed in the philosophical literature in the tradition of Hume and\nthe way that they have been approached in more recent work in logic\nand linguistics. Here, ability claims are understood as categorical\npossibility claims: claims about what some agent does in some\nnon-actual state of affairs (or \u2018possible world\u2019). Let a\nmodal theory of ability be any theory on which claims about\nan agent\u2019s abilities are understood in terms of claims about\nwhat that agent in fact does at some possible world (or set of\nworlds). The idea that some such modal theory of ability must be true\nis a presumption of much formal work on ability and\nability-ascriptions. Yet there are serious challenges to the idea that\nability is in this sense a modality.\n",
