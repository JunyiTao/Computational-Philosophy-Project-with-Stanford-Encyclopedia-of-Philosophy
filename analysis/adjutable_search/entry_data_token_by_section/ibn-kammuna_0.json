    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n\nFew facts of Ibn Kammuna\u2019s biography are confirmed (Pourjavady &\nSchmidtke 2006, 8\u201322, for most biographical details and bibliography). He is\npresumed to have been born in Baghdad and to have spent most of his\nlife there. However, there is good evidence that he spent some time in\nAleppo; his presence in that important intellectual center explains\ncertain facets of his activity that are otherwise difficult to account\nfor (Langermann 2007). He may have been descended from a family of\ncourtiers; he certainly had connections to some high officials, some of\nwhom were his patrons. Ibn Kammuna also corresponded with some leading\nintellectuals, notably Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. Shortly before his death\nin 1284, Ibn Kammuna fled Baghdad for the nearby town of Hilla. This\nmove has long been thought to have been forced upon Ibn Kammuna by\nhostile reaction to one of his books. However, it has recently been\nsuggested that it is more likely to be connected to the execution of\none of his patrons.\n\n\nIbn Kammuna was certainly born into a Jewish family. Though his\nwritings as a rule do not betray his Judaism\u2014if anything, they\nread like the work of a devout, if philosophically inclined,\nMuslim\u2014his two forays into comparative religion exhibit a clear\nbias in favor of rabbinic Judaism. Some subtle polemics are detectable\nin glosses that he wrote to an important work of Islamic\ntheology. (This is discussed in the next section.) On the other hand,\nhis attraction to Sufi-style piety does not betray any influences of\nearlier Jewish ventures in the same direction, notably by the\ndescendants of Maimonides. But did he remain Jewish until his death?\nThe evidence from citations in later writers, who generally refer to\nhim as a Jew, would indicate so.  However, there are\ncounter-indications; one may also take note of numerous pious\nreferences to the Prophet in Ibn Kammuna\u2019s writings, not all of which\ncan easily be ascribed to later scribes. The great bibliographer\nMoritz Steinschneider opined that Ibn Kammuna in fact converted; his\narguments were countered by some of the great pioneers of\nJudaeo-Arabic studies, notably D.H. Baneth. Pourjavady &\nSchmidtke, in their recent book-length study (2006), doubt the story\nof Ibn Kammuna\u2019s conversion.\n",
