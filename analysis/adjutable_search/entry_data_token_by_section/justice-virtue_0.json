    "main_text": "History || Ancient\n1.1 Ancient\n\nPhilosophical discussion of justice begins with Plato, who treats the\ntopic in a variety of dialogues, most substantially in\nRepublic. There Plato offers the first sustained discussion\nof the nature of justice (dikaiosune) and its relation to\nhappiness, as a departure from three alternatives receiving varying\ndegrees of attention. First, there is a traditionalist conception of\njustice (speaking the truth and paying your debts). Second, Plato has\nSocrates rebut the Sophist conception of justice which built on a\ndistinction between nature (phusis) and convention\n(nomos) As Plato has this conception articulated by\nThrasymachus in Book I, justice is simply the \u201cadvantage of the\nstronger,\u201d not tracking anything like the sort of value\nattributed to it by traditionalists. Finally, Plato has Socrates\nconfront a conventionalist conception of justice that anticipates\nmodern contractarian views, in which justice \u2014 forbearing\npreying on others in exchange for not being preyed on by them \u2014\nis a \u201csecond-best alternative,\u201d not as good as being able\nto prey at will upon others, but better than being the prey of others.\nThese last two challenges give rise to the central question of the\nbook: to whose advantage is justice? Would we really be better off\nbeing unjust if we could get away with it? Plato\u2019s negative\nanswer to that question is the project of the balance of the work.\n\nPlato\u2019s method involves the provocative idea that justice in the\ncity (polis) is the same thing as justice in the individual,\njust \u201cwrit large.\u201d There are good reasons to worry about\nthat assumption (Williams 1973; Keyt 2006). But in Plato\u2019s\nsociology of the city, there are three classes engaged in a kind of\ndivision of labor. There is a guardian class which rules, a class of\n\u201cauxiliaries\u201d that provide the force behind the ruling,\nand the class of merchants that produce to satisfy the needs and\ndesires of the city. Similarly, the psyche of the individual has three\nparts: a reasoning part to rule, a \u201cspirited\u201d part to\nsupport the rule of reason, and an appetitive part. Plato finds\njustice in the city to consist in each part \u201chaving and doing\nits own,\u201d and since the smaller is just like the larger, justice\nin the individual consists in each part of the psyche doing its own\nwork. (This grounds the idea, later enshrined by Justinian, that\njustice is \u201cgiving every man his due;\u201d Justinian I.i).\nFurther, Plato argues, justice is a master virtue in a sense, because\nin both the city and the psyche, if each part is doing its own job,\nboth city and psyche will also have wisdom, courage, and moderation or\nself-discipline. This conception of justice sustains the contrast with\nthe conventionalist view advocated by the Sophists. On the other hand,\nat least initially it leaves it an open question whether the just\nindividual refrains from such socially proscribed actions as lying,\nkilling, and stealing. Plato eventually seeks to show that someone\nwith a healthy, harmonious soul wouldn\u2019t lie, kill, or steal,\nbut it is not clear that argument succeeds, nor, if it does, that that\nis the right understanding of why we ought not to lie, kill, or steal\n(Sachs 1963; LeBar 2013, ch. XII).\n\nPlato gives a somewhat different treatment of justice in\nCrito, in which Socrates\u2019 eponymous friend attempts to\npersuade Socrates to accept his (Crito\u2019s) offer to bribe a way\nout of the death sentence Socrates is waiting to have executed. Here\nPlato\u2019s arguments first associate the just life with the good\nlife, thus the life Socrates has most reason to live. And justice, he\nthen argues, requires not only not inflicting wrong or injury on\nothers, even in response to wrongs from them, but fulfilling\none\u2019s agreements, and \u2014 in particular \u2014 abiding by\none\u2019s (tacit or explicit) agreement to abide by the laws of the\ncity unless one can persuade it to change them. Of course, justice\ncannot require one to abide by laws that require one to act unjustly,\nas Socrates\u2019 own case (as characterized in Apology)\nshows (Kraut 1984).\n\nIt is worth noting (as Johnston 2011 observes) that even if Plato\u2019s\nis the first philosophical discussion of justice, a concern\nwith what an individual is due as a matter of justice is a driving\nissue in Homer\u2019s Iliad, though there is no counterpart\nconcern there with justice as a property of a society or tribe. So\neven Plato\u2019s philosophical concerns are building on well-established\nquestions about what justice requires of us in our treatment of one\nanother.\n\nAristotle does not see the virtue of justice in quite the\ncomprehensive sense Plato does; he treats it as a virtue of character\n(in the entirety of one of the ten books of the Nicomachean\nEthics, also common to the Eudemian Ethics), and as a\nvirtue of constitutions and political arrangements (in\nPolitics). The question naturally arises as to the relation\nbetween these forms of justice. Aristotle seems to think they are\nclosely related, without being synonymous applications of the same\nconcept. As the latter is a conception of political justice, we will\nfocus here on the former. Justice as a personal virtue follows\nAristotle\u2019s model for virtues of character, in which the virtue\nlies as an intermediate or mean between vices of excess and defect\n(Nicomachean Ethics V). While he grants that there is a\n\u201cgeneral\u201d sense of justice in which justice is coincident\nwith complete virtue, there is a \u201cparticular\u201d sense in\nwhich it is concerned with not overreaching (pleonexia). It\nis not clear, however, exactly how Aristotle understands this\narrangement, or the nature of the vices of excess and defect which\nthis \u201cparticular\u201d justice is to counteract. One very\nplausible reading has it that justice is opposed to a desire for\nmaldistribution of \u201cgoods of fortune\u201d such as money, fame,\nor honor (Williams 1980; Curzer 1995). On another it is opposed to an\ninsufficient attention to others\u2019 rights (Foot 1988, p. 9). On\nstill another it focuses on the goods of others, or common goods\n(O\u2019Connor 1988; Miller 1995).\n\nThese issues remain open in part because Aristotle seems most\ninterested in establishing a conception of the formal\nstructure of \u201cparticular\u201d justice, which seems to\nreflect a conception of desert. He distinguishes between justice in\ndistribution and justice in rectification. The former, he claims,\nadheres to a kind of proportionality, in which what each deserves is\nproportional to the relationship between the contributions. If A\ncontributes twice as much as B (of whatever the metric of merit is\nrelevant in some particular case), then A\u2019s return ought also to\nbe twice B\u2019s. This conception of distributive justice obviously\nlends itself to \u201cgoods of fortune\u201d \u2014 and to some\ngoods, like wealth, more obviously than others \u2014 but it need not\nin principle be confined to such goods, although the examples\nAristotle provides suggest such applications. Similarly, justice in\nrectification involves a sort of \u201carithmetical\nproportion.\u201d If C defrauds D by amount X, then justice requires\ndepriving C of X and restoring X to D, as a matter of reestablishing a\nkind of equality between them. These structural devices are elegant\nand attractive, but they leave open a number of questions (LeBar,\nforthcoming). First, as indicated, to what are we to suppose they\napply? Second, in what way do they figure into the nature of the\nperson who is just in the particular sense? (That is, how are they\nrelated to justice as a virtue?) Does a model of particular justice as\na virtue fit the general model of virtue as a mean, and if so, what\nsort of mean is it? Aristotle seems torn between a conception of\njustice as a virtue in his distinctive understanding of what a virtue\nis \u2014 with a requirement that one have all the virtues to have\nany (Nicomachean EthicsVI.13), and rooted in the doctrine of\nthe mean \u2014 and justice as having the form of a formal normative\nstructure, to which the virtue threatens to become subsidiary. All\nthis is to leave aside questions of the relation between this\n\u201cparticular\u201d sense of justice and political justice, and\nthe role of the virtue of justice in the individual as it contributes\nto justice in the polis.\n\nEpicurus\u2019 conception of the role of justice was more central to\nhis eudaimonism perhaps than its counterpart in Plato and Aristotle,\nbut that reflects in part his distinctive understanding of\neudaimonia, or happiness. For Epicurus this consisted in\nataraxia \u2014 tranquility, or freedom from disturbance.\nGiven that the good life is the life without disturbance, justice\nplays a key instrumental role. One might, Epicurus thinks, withdraw\nentirely from human society to avoid disturbance, but the alternative\nis to live socially under terms which secure the avoidance of\ndisturbance. This is the structure of the ideal Epicurean community,\nin which each forbears aggression (Armstrong 1997, Thrasher 2013).\nJustice is a matter of keeping agreements generally, and in particular\nthe agreement not to harm or transgress social norms.\n\nIn this way Epicurus offers a conception of the virtue of justice that\nharmonizes both its personal and its political dimensions. The\npersonal virtue consists in the motivation to abide by a contract not\nto aggress or harm others. The political virtue inheres in a polity in\nwhich such norms regulate the conduct of its citizens, and these two\ndimensions of justice as a virtue reinforce each other.\n\nThe other great ethical tradition of antiquity (Stoicism) had\nremarkably little to say about justice (Annas 1993, p. 311), so we\npass on to the medieval and modern periods.\n",
