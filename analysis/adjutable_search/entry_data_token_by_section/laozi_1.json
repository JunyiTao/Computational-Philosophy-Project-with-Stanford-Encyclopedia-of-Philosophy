    "main_text": "Date and Authorship of the Laozi\n2. Date and Authorship of the Laozi\n\n\nThe date of composition refers to the time when the Laozi\nreached more or less its final form; it does not rule out later\ninterpolations or corruptions. The traditional view, of course, is\nthat the Laozi was written by Lao Dan in the sixth or early\nfifth century B.C.E. This seems unlikely, however, if it is assumed\nthat the Laozi was written by a single author. As the\narchaeological evidence to be presented below will indicate, bodies of\nsayings attributed to Laozi were committed to writing probably from\nthe second half of the fifth century B.C.E., resulting in different\ncollections with overlapping contents. These collections grew,\ncompeted for attention, and gradually came to be consolidated during\nthe fourth century B.C.E. By the middle of the third century B.C.E.,\nthe Laozi probably reached a relatively stable form.\n\n\nIt is possible, as A. C. Graham suggests, that the Laozi was\nascribed to Lao Dan around 250 B.C.E. by the text\u2019s author or\n\u201cpubliciser,\u201d capitalizing on Lao Dan\u2019s reputation (1986,\n119; also see Graham 1989). It is also possible that\nthe Laozi has \u201cpreserved\u201d the ideas of Lao\nDan. W. T. Chan, for example, believes that the text\n\u201cembodied\u201d the teachings of Laozi, although it was not\nwritten until the fourth century (1963, 74).\n\n\nIt seems reasonable to suppose that Laozi, whether or not his real\nname was Li Er, attracted a following and that some of his sayings\nentered the world of Chinese philosophical discourse during the fifth\ncentury B.C.E. A process of oral transmission may have preceded the\nappearance of these sayings in written form.\n\n\nIt is conceivable that a succession of editors or compilers brought\ntogether diverse bodies of Laozi sayings, resulting in the\nmature Laozi. D. C. Lau, for example, is of the view that\nthe Laozi is an \u201canthology\u201d (1963, 14). According\nto Bruce Brooks and Taeko Brooks, the Laozi contains\ndifferent layers of material spanning the period between 340 and 249\nB.C.E.\u2014\u201cits long timespan precludes a single author\u201d\n(1998, 151). Indeed, Chad Hansen describes the \u201cdominant current\ntextual theory\u201d of the Daodejing as one which\n\u201ctreats the text as an edited accumulation of fragments and bits\ndrawn from a wide variety of sources \u2026 there was no single\nauthor, no Laozi\u201d (1992, 201).\n\n\nAlthough in this sense the Laozi may be regarded as a\ncomposite work, the product of many hands over a long period of time,\nit should not be assumed that the sayings that now inhabit\nthe Laozi were put together at random. More likely, the final\nproduct reflects a process of intellectual distillation on the part of\nthe compilers, who arranged and/or altered the material at their\ndisposal (see also LaFargue 1992 and Mair 1990 on the composition of\nthe Laozi).\n\n\nThe language of the Laozi does provide some clues to its date\nof composition. Much of the text is rhymed. Focusing on rhyme\npatterns, Liu Xiaogan (1994 and 1997) concludes that the poetic\nstructure of the Laozi is closer to that of\nthe Shijing (Classic of Poetry) than that of the\nlater Chuci (Songs of Chu).\n\n\nThe dating of the Shijing and the Chuci is by no\nmeans precise, although generally the poems collected in the former\nshould not be later than the early fifth century B.C.E., whereas those\ncollected in the latter can be traced to no earlier than the middle of\nthe Warring States period, around 300 B.C.E. For this reason, Liu\nXiaogan argues, the traditional view first articulated by Sima Qian\nshould be upheld. Examining a wider range of linguistic evidence,\nWilliam Baxter agrees that the Laozi should be dated earlier\nthan the Zhuangzi and the Chuci, but he traces\n\u201cthe bulk of the Lao-tzu to the mid or early fourth\ncentury\u201d (1998, 249). Both Liu and Baxter provide a concise\nanalysis of the different theories of the date of\nthe Laozi.\n\n\nWhy is all this important? It may be argued that date and authorship\nare immaterial to and may detract from interpretation. The\n\u201ctruth\u201d of the Laozi is \u201ctimeless,\u201d\naccording to this view, transcending historical and cultural\nspecificities. Issues of provenance are important, however, if context\nhas any role to play in the production of meaning.\n\n\nPolemics among different schools of thought, for example, were far\nmore pronounced during the Warring States period than in the earlier\n\u201cSpring and Autumn\u201d period (770\u2013481 B.C.E.). (There\nare different ways to date the Spring and Autumn and Warring States\nperiods, but they do not affect the discussion here.) The Zhou\ngovernment had been in decline; warfare among the \u201cfeudal\u201d\nstates intensified both in scale and frequency from the fourth century\nB.C.E. onward. As the political conditions deteriorated, philosophers\nand strategists, who grew both in number and popularity as a social\ngroup or profession during this time, vied to convince the rulers of\nthe various states of their program to bring order to the land. At the\nsame time, perhaps with the increased displacement and disillusionment\nof the privileged elite, a stronger eremitic tradition also\nemerged. If the bulk of the Laozi had originated from the\nfourth century, it might reflect some of these concerns. From this\nperspective, the origin of the Laozi is as much a\nhermeneutical issue as it is a historical one.\n",
