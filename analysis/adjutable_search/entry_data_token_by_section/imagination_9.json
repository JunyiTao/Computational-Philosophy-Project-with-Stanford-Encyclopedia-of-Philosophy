    "main_text": "Imagination in Cognitive Architecture || Imagination and Supposition\n2.5 Imagination and Supposition\n\nTo suppose is to form a hypothetical mental representation.\nThere exists a highly contentious debate on whether supposition is\ncontinuous with imagination, which is also a hypothetical attitude, or\nwhether there are enough differences to make them discontinuous. There\nare two main options for distinguishing imagination and supposition,\nby phenomenology and by function.\n\nThe phenomenological distinction standardly turns on the notion of\nvivacity: whereas imaginings are vivid, suppositions are not. Indeed,\none often finds in this literature the contrast between \u201cmerely\nsupposing\u201d and \u201cvividly imagining\u201d. Although\nvivacity has been frequently invoked in discussions of imagination,\nAmy Kind (2017) draws on empirical and theoretical considerations to\nargue that it is ultimately philosophically untenable. If that is\ncorrect, then the attempt to demarcate imagination and supposition by\ntheir vivacity is untenable too. More rarely, other phenomenological\ndifferences are invoked; for example, Brian Weatherson (2004) contends\nthat \u201csupposing can be coarse in a way that imagining\ncannot\u201d.\n\n\n\n \nImagination\nSupposition \n\nAffect \nVariable \nAtypical  \n\nMonitoring \nTypical \nTypical  \n\nInference \nTypical \nTypical  \n\nUpdater \nTypical \nAtypical  \n\nDomain-Specific Systems \nTypical \nVariable  \n\nScript Elaborator \nVariable \nAtypical  \n\nInputter (punctuate) \nTypical \nTypical  \n\nInputter (streaming) \nTypical \nAtypical  \n\n\nTable 1. Architectural similarities and\ndifferences between imagination and supposition (Weinberg & Meskin\n2006).\n\n\nThere have been diverse functional distinctions attributed to the\ndiscontinuity between imagination and supposition, but none has gained\nuniversal acceptance. Richard Moran (1994) contends that imagination\ntends to give rise to a wide range of further mental states, including\naffective responses, whereas supposition does not (see also Arcangeli\n2014, 2017). Tamar Szab\u00f3 Gendler (2000a) contends that while\nattempting to imagine something like that female infanticide is\nmorally right seems to generate imaginative resistance, supposing it\ndoes not (see the discussion on imaginative resistance in\n Supplement on Puzzles and Paradoxes of Imagination and the Arts).\n Gregory Currie and Ian Ravenscroft (2002) contend that supposition\ninvolves only cognitive imagination, but imagination involves both\ncognitive and conative imagination. Alvin Goldman contends that\nsuppositional imagination involves supposing that particular\ncontent obtains (for example, supposing that I am elated) but\nenactment imagination involves \u201cenacting, or trying to\nenact, elation itself.\u201d (2006: 47\u201348, italics omitted).\nTyler Doggett and Andy Egan (2007) contend that imagination tends to\nmotivate pretense actions, but supposition tends not to. On Jonathan\nWeinberg and Aaron Meskin (2006)\u2019s synthesis, while there are a\nfew functional similarities, there are many more functional\ndifferences between imagination and supposition (Table 1).\n\nThere remain ongoing debates about specific alleged functional\ndistinctions, and about whether the functional distinctions are\nnumerous or fundamental enough to warrant discontinuism or not.\nIndeed, it remains contentious which philosophers count as continuists\nand which philosophers count as discontinuists (for a few sample\ntaxonomies, see Arcangeli 2017; Balcerak Jackson 2016; Kind 2013).\n",
