    "main_text": "Six central methodological problems || Social scientific naturalism\n2.3 Social scientific naturalism\n\nOf all the social sciences, economics most closely resembles the\nnatural sciences. Economic theories have been axiomatized, and\narticles and books of economics are full of theorems. Of all the\nsocial sciences, only economics boasts an ersatz Nobel Prize.\nEconomics is thus a test case for those concerned with the extent of\nthe similarities between the natural and social sciences. Those who\nhave wondered whether social sciences must differ fundamentally from\nthe natural sciences seem to have been concerned mainly with three\nquestions:\n\n(i) Are there fundamental differences between the structure or\nconcepts of theories and\n explanations\n in the natural and social sciences? Some of these issues were already\nmentioned in the discussion above of reasons versus causes.\n\n(ii) Are there fundamental differences in goals? Philosophers and\neconomists have argued that in addition to or instead of the\npredictive and explanatory goals of the natural sciences, the social\nsciences should aim at providing us with understanding. Weber\nand others have argued that the social sciences should provide us with\nan understanding \u201cfrom the inside\u201d, that we should be able\nto empathize with the reactions of the agents and to find what happens\n\u201cunderstandable\u201d (Weber 1904, Knight 1935, Machlup 1969a).\nThis (and the closely related recognition that explanations cite\nreasons rather than just causes) seems to introduce an element of\nsubjectivity into the social sciences that is not found in the natural\nsciences.\n\n(iii) Owing to the importance of human choices (or perhaps free will),\nare social phenomena too irregular to be captured within a framework\nof laws and theories? Given human free will, perhaps human behavior is\nintrinsically unpredictable and not subject to any laws. But there\nare, in fact, many regularities in human action, and given the\nenormous causal complexity characterizing some natural systems, the\nnatural sciences must cope with many irregularities, too.\n",
