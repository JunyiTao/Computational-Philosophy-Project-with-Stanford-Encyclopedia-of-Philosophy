Methodological Commensurability\n\nThose arguing for radical incommensurability \u2013 the view that the\nquestions and answers in one tradition cannot sustain meaningful\nstatement in the other tradition \u2013 rely on the recognition of\nradical difference in basic concepts and modes of inquiry. Given such\nradical differences, they argue, there can be no cross-traditional\nreference to a common subject matter and to a truth about that subject\nmatter that is independent of the basic conceptual vocabulary and\ntheories and justificatory practices of a particular tradition (see\nRorty, 1989, and Shweder, 1989). Looking for a possible\nChinese-Western instance of radical incommensurability, one might go\nto Daoist texts such as the Daodejing and the\nZhuangzi. When it is said in chapter one (as traditionally\narranged and on one translation) of the Daodejing that\n\u201cThe Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Way,\u201d\nor in chapter two that the \u201csages abide in nonaction and\npractice the teaching that is without words,\u201d one is finding\nsomething different from the usual in Western texts infused with\nideals of discursive rationality and argumentation. Or consider the\nLunyu or Analects 1:2, where the importance of\nrightly ordered family relations is emphasized for right order in the\nstate (\u201cHe who has grown to be a filial son and respectful\nyounger brother will be unlikely to defy his superiors and there has\nnever been the case of someone inclined to defy his superiors and stir\nup a rebellion\u201d). The prominent and enduring place of this theme\nof state as family writ large sets that tradition apart from Western\ncontractual traditions that have come to emphasize right order in the\nstate as that which can be ratified by an uncoerced agreement among\nequals concerned to protect their private interests. Opponents of\nradical incommensurability will level the charge that it presupposes a\nhyperdramatic contrast between traditions. For example, the Western\ntradition has not lacked for skeptics on the power of discursive\nrationality, and some of these skeptics have nevertheless believed in\na mode of veridical access to something of supreme significance\n\u2013 to a powerful experience within themselves or to something\nmuch larger outside themselves. At the same time, it must be noted\nthat the positive theme is more recessive in the Western tradition and\nappears mainly in theistic versions, as it does in Plotinus\n(Enneads), Meister Eckhart (Von unsagbaren Dingen)\nand Hildegaard of Bingen (Scivias). Similarly, the Western\ntradition has certainly housed strains of thought that do view the\nstate as more of a natural outgrowth of small human groups such as\nfamily and community. Even a major modern figure such as David Hume\n(Treatise of Human Nature, 3.2.2) explicitly rejects the idea\nof contract as central to understanding the origin or justification of\nsocial and political bonds. There might still be a difference between\nChinese and Western traditions with respect to which strains of\nthought become dominant or at least prevalent, but that difference\ndoes not appear to come under the heading of radical\nincommensurability.\n\nSamuel Fleischacker (1992) proposes a more moderate version of\nincommensurability \u2013 sometimes we can understand others just\nwell enough to know that we don\u2019t understand them. His argument\nhas roots in Wittgenstein\u2019s view that knowledge depends on a\nbackground of shared assumptions and standards of evidence.\n\u201cWorld pictures\u201d are embedded within cultures. Our world\npicture involves not only a distinctive set of beliefs about the world\nbut also an ordering of interests that determines how we go about\ntrying to have reliable beliefs. This ordering differs from those\ndominant in other cultures. We in the West have given precedence to\nour interests in \u201cegalitarian knowledge\u201d(wanting and\nbelieving that people have roughly equal access to the truth) and in\nprediction and control of this-worldly objects. The world pictures of\nother cultures embody other interests, and we may not be able to prove\nthat they are wrong, or indeed, we may be unable to fully understand\nwhy it is that they value the interests they value so highly.\nNevertheless, we understand that they do value these interests highly\nand think they are wrong to do so. We make such judgments despite our\nmerely partial understanding because we tend to see a certain set of\ninterests as the proper guide for a minimally decent or sensible human\nlife.\n\nThe idea that the distinctive character of a \u201cworld\npicture\u201d lies partly in the interests they embody seems\nplausible. Daoism and Confucianism, at least after a certain stage in\nthe development of these schools, exemplify the way that a set of\ninterests intertwine with beliefs about the world. Both schools\nexemplify in different ways a conception of understanding the world\nthat is inseparable from the interest in coming into\n\u201cattunement\u201d with it, to use a felicitous word from\nCharles Taylor (1982). To become attuned to the world is to see its\ngoodness and to know one\u2019s place in the order of the world. To\nsay that Daoists exemplify this theme about seeing the goodness of the\nworld is in a way misleading, since there is in the Daodejing\nand Zhuangzi a profound mistrust of our conceptual\nseparations between opposites such as good and bad. The notion of\n\u201cnonaction\u201d or wuwei, most prominently featured\nin the Daodejing, does not denote literal inaction but\npresupposes something like the possibility of an unforced acting\nwith the grain of things, and that presupposes that it is\npossible to become attuned to that grain while in a state of awareness\nthat is not cluttered by distorting conceptual oppositions. The\nDaodejing straightforwardly recommends wuwei and in\nthis sense seems to presuppose the goodness of the world and the way\nits \u201cgrain\u201d goes. Confucian texts uphold the ideal of a\ndifferent kind of attunement, under which the world and its order can\nbe called good without the ambiguity that Daoist skepticism with\nconceptual opposition creates. For example, the Mencius (the\nname is actually a latinization given by Christian missionaries\nfor\u2018Mengzi\u2019) presents a theory that human nature\ncontains the germs or sprouts of goodness, tendencies to certain\nfeelings and judgments such as manifested by the feeling of compassion\nfor a child about to fall into a well. These sprouts are in human\nnature because they were sent by tian (literally meaning\n\u2018sky\u2019 but most often translated as \u2018Heaven\u2019\nand perhaps best conceived as an impersonal ordering force of the\nuniverse). Taylor thinks that modern science has severed the\nconnection between understanding and attunement. In\nFleischacker\u2019s terms, modern science is predicated on different\ninterests, prediction and control foremost among these interests.\nTaylor believes that the severance of understanding and attunement\nresulted in superior understanding at least of physical nature. But as\nhe is careful to point out, no single argument can prove global\nsuperiority. If we can take attunement as an ideal, we have failed\nmiserably, even as our technological control of nature has increased\nimmeasurably. Perhaps, then, the contrast between a Chinese world\npicture in which attunement figures prominently and a modern\nscientific view predicated on the interests of prediction and control\nserves as an example of the sort of moderate incommensurability\nFleischacker has in mind. One question to be raised about this kind of\nincommensurability, however, is whether it truly involves lack of\nunderstanding between traditions. Taylor himself draws examples of the\ntheme of attunement from Plato and the European cultural tradition. Do\nwe really fail to understand the appeal behind world pictures of\nattunement? Taylor\u2019s complex assessment suggests no inability on\nour part to understand the force behind both kinds of world pictures.\nEven to take the stance that attunement pictures are comforting\nillusions (an assessment less complex than the one Taylor adopts) is\nto suppose that one does understand the appeal behind them.\n\nSometimes the case for incommensurability is made by pointing to the\npervasive and central presence of a term in one tradition for which no\nequivalent term can be found in another tradition. Such a difference\nmay point to a degree of divergence of interests as suggested by\nFleischacker. However, it is better to explore the implications of\nthis kind of untranslatability case by case. Erin Cline (2013) has\nargued for the presence of a concept of justice in the\nAnalects despite the fact that it contains no word that is\nequivalent in meaning. Cline points to concerns expressed in the text\nthat relate to justice: about poverty and distribution of wealth;\nabout the need for trust in others in striving for a common good that\none shares with them; about how that sense of trust begins in the\nfamily; about the need for concern to expand to all people even if it\nstarts in the family; and about yi or rightness as a virtue\nas involving fair- mindedness. If there is a contrast between the\nancient Chinese tradition as represented by the Analects and\nmodern Western traditions, it may be more a matter of the latter being\nespecially focused on matters of distribution of goods by\ninstitutions, rather than that interest being entirely absent in the\nConfucian tradition. Often, the comparative situation is a complex one\nin which philosophers from different traditions diverge substantially\nin many ways, yet converge in interesting ways in some of their\ncentral concerns. Aaron Stalnaker (2006) proposes a comparative\nmethodology involving \u201cbridge concepts\u201d that facilitates\nexploration of such simultaneous divergence and convergence. Augustine\nand Xunzi, he suggests, are both centrally concerned with human nature\nand \u201cspiritual exercises\u201d intended to transform the self.\nBut such concepts as those of human nature and spiritual exercises are\nnot single concepts but a cluster of concepts, and in using them as\nfocal points of comparison, one should be aware of their complexity\nand the different as well as similar ways they might operate in the\nthought of Augustine and Xunzi.\n\nA different kind of incommensurability that may arise is not\nincomprehensibility between traditions but lack of common standards\nsufficient for settling significant conflicts between them. Alasdair\nMacIntyre (1988, 1989) has illustrated the difference between being\nable to understand a tradition and being able to translate all its\nclaims into the language of another tradition by pointing to the\npossibility of \u201cbilinguals\u201d \u2013 people who, for\nexample, might have been raised within one community and its\ntradition, and then through migration or conquest, become a member of\nanother community and its different tradition. Such bilinguals might\nvery well understand each tradition, and such understanding might\ninclude knowledge of those parts of each that cannot be translated\ninto the language of the other. Such bilinguals would not encounter\nthe sort of radical incommensurability constituted by\nincomprehensibility, but they may be unable to resolve conflicts\nof belief between the traditions, instead having to relativize\nthe claims of each in some such form as \u201cseems true to this\nparticular community\u201d or \u201cseems justified to this\nparticular community.\u201d This kind of \u201cevaluational\u201d\nincommensurability, rather than meaning incommensurability, might fit\nbetter the case of world pictures based on attunement versus world\npictures that sever the connection between understanding and\nattunement. MacIntyre himself presents a possibility for resolving\nsuch conflicts in case one tradition continually fails in its attempts\nto address certain key problems or issues. If another tradition has\nthe conceptual resources to explain why it is that the first tradition\ncontinues to fail, then advocates of that first tradition may have to\nacknowledge its limitations and even transfer their allegiances.\nWhether that is the case for conflicts over attunement is not obvious\n(See Wong, 1989).\n\nMoving to the end opposite from various forms of incommensurability,\nwe find views holding that there must be substantial agreement\nbetween traditions. The argument stems from a conception of the way\ninterpretation works. We proceed on the assumption that the others we\nare interpreting live in the same world as we do.We subvert this\nassumption, however, if we attribute to them beliefs that\nsubstantially differ from our own. As Donald Davidson (1980) has\nargued, a belief is identified by its location in a pattern of\nbeliefs, and it is this pattern that determines the subject matter of\nthe belief, what the belief is about. If we attribute to others a\npattern of beliefs that are different from our own, i.e., false\nbeliefs, this tends to undermine the identification of the subject\nmatter; to undermine, therefore, the validity of the belief as being\nabout that subject. David Cooper (1978) applies a Davidsonian\nprinciple of charity to the question of whether different cultures\nhave more or less the same morality. We can only identify\nothers\u2019 beliefs as moral beliefs about a given subject matter if\nthere is a massive degree of agreement between their and our beliefs\nabout that subject matter. For Cooper this implies that the moral\nbeliefs we attribute to others must be about something connected with\nwelfare, happiness, suffering, security, and the good life. Michele\nMoody-Adams (1997) gives a more recent version of the same argument,\nstarting with the premise that understanding others requires that\nthere be quite substantial agreement about many of the basic concepts\nthat are relevant to moral reflection. She concludes that\n\u201cultimate\u201d or \u201cfundamental\u201d moral disagreement\nis not possible.\n\nThe way that an earlier example of putative radical difference can be\nquestioned serves as some confirmation of this argument from charity\nfor strong agreement between traditions. Confucian conceptions of the\nstate as family writ large are not especially puzzling even when we do\nnot subscribe to them. We find similar themes that have arisen within\nthe Western tradition, and again, it is possible to conceive what the\nappeal would be. However, these points also raise certain doubts about\nthe use of charity to argue for strong agreement. The fact that we can\npoint to similar beliefs within our own tradition and that we can\nimagine what the appeal would lie behind such beliefs does not mean\nthat we share those beliefs with others even as we attribute to them.\nEven if we were to share with them a belief in certain values, that\nwould not necessarily mean that we place the same importance on those\nvalues relative to other values we (and perhaps they also) hold. It is\noften observed that a distinctive feature of the Chinese Confucian\ntradition is the very high value placed on filial piety. It is a\ncommon feature of many cultures that one should honor thy father and\nmother, of course, and it is not difficult to find analogies within\nAmerican society to Confucian filial piety. At the same time, the\nConfucian tradition is unusual in the stringency of its duties to\nparents. The scope of filial duties includes taking care of what\nparents alone could have given one \u2013 one\u2019s body. Cengzi, one\nof Confucius\u2019 students, is portrayed in 8.3 of the\nAnalects as gravely ill and near death. He bids his students\nto look at his hands and feet, and quotes lines from the Book of\nPoetry to convey the idea that all his life he has been keeping\nhis body intact as part of his duty to his parents. It is only now\nnear death, he says, that he can be sure of having been spared and\nthus fulfilling this duty to parents. This very idea, that one must\nkeep one\u2019s body intact as a duty of gratitude to one\u2019s\nparents, has remained a central idea in Chinese culture. While\nAmerican culture certainly contains similar themes of gratitude toward\nthose from whom one has received great benefits, such themes do not\nnecessitate agreement on the centrality and stringency of filial duties\nin the Confucian tradition. Important kinds of moral difference, then,\nmay consist in the differing emphases given to values that are shared\nacross cultural traditions (Wong, 1996b). Thomas Kasulis (2002) puts a\nsimilar point in a visual metaphor: what is foreground in one culture\nmay be background in another culture.\n\nTo accommodate this more subtle kind of difference, proponents of the\nprinciple of charity might point out that charity does not require\ncomplete agreement, but only \u201csubstantial\u201d agreement or\nagreement on \u201cultimate\u201d or \u201cfundamental\u201d\ndisagreement. A further question that will pressed against this\nposition is how much agreement is sufficient for identification of\nothers\u2019 beliefs as being about the same subject matter as ours.\nWe do attribute to others error and simple difference (without judging\nthat someone is in error) of belief about the same subject matter. We\ncan attribute error to others if we believe them to be in\ncircumstances that encourage error, and we identify such types of\ncircumstance from past experience of discovering ourselves to be in\nerror. Furthermore, we attribute simple difference of belief when we\nrecognize that there is a range of reasonable interpretations or\nweightings to be given to evidence.\n\nIn his later writings on charity (2001, p. 196), Davidson recognized\nits ambiguities, noting that he previously tended to construe it in\nterms of \u201cmaximizing\u201d agreement in belief and that a more\nperspicuous statement of what he had in mind all along is that\nagreement in beliefs should be \u201coptimized.\u201d Rather than\nthe \u201cmost\u201d agreement, we need the \u201cright sort\u201d\nof agreement that enables understanding of others. We should try to\nreach agreement \u201cas far as possible, subject to considerations\nof simplicity, hunches about the effects of social conditioning, and\nof course our common-sense, or scientific, knowledge of explicable\nerror.\u201d This very qualified formulation of charity amounts to\nthe admission that the principle of charity itself needs\ninterpretation and hence cannot be the ultimate standard for\ninterpretation. Henry Richardson (1997) points out that interpreting a\nphilosophical text requires taking account of the cognitive aims the\nauthors had in writing what they did. Is it more charitable,\nRichardson asks, for a translator of Machiavelli\u2019s The\nPrince to resolve ambiguities and seek to maximize agreement\nbetween Machiavelli and ourselves? Or is it more charitable to set him\nout as intentionally provocative and deliberately cryptic? It should\nbe unsurprising that charity cannot fulfill its promise as a firm and\nclear guide to interpretation. Charity bids us to render others like\n\u201cus,\u201d but \u201cwe\u201d are already a diverse group who\nbelieve and want and value somewhat different things. That is, the\nrange of the intelligibly human already embraces diversity (think of\nhow impoverished our models of understanding would be if we could only\nrely on our individual selves). See Mou (2006) for a range of articles\non the way that Davidson\u2019s interpretive principle and other\naspects of his philosophy relate to Chinese philosophy.\n\nAn alternative to both the radical incommensurability and strong\nagreement positions is that there is no general answer on how much\nagreement or disagreement is to be found between complex and\nheterogeneous traditions such as the Chinese and Western. As emerged\nabove, one must distinguish between meaning and evaluational\nincommensurabilities. Furthermore, how much disagreement we will find\nnot only depends on the particular subject matter but also on the\nanswers we find most plausible within a larger context of inquiry: the\nattempt to explain others, their actions, practices, institutions,\nand history. In such a larger context, attribution to others of\nbeliefs different from ours may be more or less reasonable depending\non how it fits into a reasonable explanation of them. And what counts\nas a reasonable explanation in particular cases will be set within the\ncontext of one\u2019s larger theories about persons and societies,\namong other things. One\u2019s explanation of people can reasonably\nattribute error or simple difference of belief on an indefinite number\nof important matters that might even deserve to be called\n\u2018fundamental\u2019 as long as it seems plausible to attribute\nerror or simple difference of belief to them in their epistemic\nsituation as we construe it (see also Grandy, 1973). Or one\u2019s\nexplanation can reasonably imply convergence or similarity of belief.\nAn intermediate possibility is that the difference or similarity\nbecomes more prominent as one defines the subject matter in a\n\u2018thicker\u2019 or \u2018thinner\u2019 way (Shun, 2004). Does\nthe Chinese tradition recognize individual rights? The answer, as\nshall emerge below, may depend on how specifically one defines the\nnotion of a right. If one defines a right rather thinly as what one\nhas whenever one has justifiable claims on others to assure\none\u2019s possession of things or one\u2019s exercise of certain\ncapacities, then one can plausibly argue that there is a common notion\nof rights between the Chinese and Western traditions (Wong, 2004a).\nIf, on the other hand, one \u2018thickens\u2019 one\u2019s\ndefinition of rights with the idea that they are justifiable\nindependently of what is a good and worthwhile life for human beings,\nthen one plausibly argue against a common notion of rights.\n",
