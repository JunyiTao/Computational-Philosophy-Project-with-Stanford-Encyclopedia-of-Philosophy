    "main_text": "Three-self Theories || 20th Century Theologians and \u201cSocial\u201d Theories\n2.2 20th Century Theologians and \u201cSocial\u201d Theories\n\nSome influential 20th-century theologians interpreted the Trinity as\ncontaining just one self. (See section\n 1.3\n above.) In the second half of the century, many theologians reacted\nagainst one-self theories, criticizing them as modalist or as somehow\nnear-modalist. This period also saw the wide and often uncritical\nadoption of a paradigm for classifying Trinity theories which derives\nfrom 19th c. French Catholic theologian Th\u00e9odore de\nR\u00e9gnon (Barnes 1995). On this paradigm, Western or Latin or\nAugustinian theories are contrasted with Eastern or Greek or\nCappadocian theories, and the difference between the camps is said to\nbe merely one of emphases or \u201cstarting points\u201d. The\nWestern theories, it is said, emphasize or \u201cstart with\u201d\nGod\u2019s oneness, and try to show how God is also three, whereas\nthe Eastern theories emphasize or \u201cstart with\u201d God\u2019s\nthreeness, and try to show how God is also one. The two are thought to\nemphasize, respectively, psychological or social analogies for\nunderstanding the Trinity, and so the latter is often called\n\u201csocial\u201d trinitarianism. But this paradigm has been\ncriticized as confused, unhelpful, and simply not accurate to the\nhistory of Trinitarian theology (Cross 2002, 2009; Holmes 2012; McCall\n2003).\n\nAlthough the language of Latin vs. \u201csocial\u201d Trinity\ntheories has been adopted by many analytic philosophers (e.g. Leftow\n1999; Hasker 2010c; Tuggy 2003a), these have interpreted the different\ntheories as logically inconsistent (i.e. such that\u00a0both\ncan\u2019t be true), and not merely as differing in style, emphasis,\nor sequence.\n\nSome 20th century theological sources, accepting the de R\u00e9gnon\nparadigm, proceed to blame the Western tradition for\n\u201coveremphasizing the oneness\u201d of God, and recommend that\nbalance may be restored by looking to the Eastern tradition. A number\nof concerns characterize theologians in this 20th and 21st century\nmovement of \u201csocial\u201d trinitarianism:\n\nPreserving genuinely interpersonal relationships between the\nPersons of the Trinity, particularly the Father and the Son.\nDoing justice to the New Testament idea of Christ as a personal\nmediator between God and humankind.\nSuspicion that the \u201cstatic\u201d categories of Greek\nphilosophy have in previous trinitarian theologies obscured the\ndynamic and personal nature of the triune God.\nConcern that traditional or Western trinitarian theology has made\nthe doctrine irrelevant to practical concerns such as politics, gender\nrelations, and family life.\nThe idea that to be Love itself, or for God to be perfectly\nloving, God must contain three subjects or persons (or at any rate,\nmore than one). (See sections\n 2.3,\n 2.5, and\n 2.6.)\n\n\n(For surveys of this literature see K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen 2007; Olson\nand Hall 2002, 95\u2013115; Peters 1993, 103\u201345.) These writers\nare often unclear about what Trinity theory they\u2019re endorsing.\nThe views seem to range from tritheism, to the idea that the Trinity\nis an event, to something that differs only slightly, or only in\nemphasis, from pro-Nicene or one-self theories (see section\n 1\n and section\n 3.3\n of the supplementary document on the history of trinitarian\ndoctrines). Merricks observes that some views advertised as\n\u201csocial trinitarianism\u201d make it \u201csound equivalent to\nthe thesis that the Doctrine of the Trinity is true but modalism is\nfalse\u201d (Merricks 2006, 306). However, a number of Christian\nphilosophers, and some theologians employing the methods of analytic\nphilosophy, have started with this literature and then proceeded to\ndevelop relatively clear three-self Trinity theories, which are\nsurveyed here. They differ in how they attempt to secure monotheism\n(Leftow 1999). There are many such Trinity theories, and it is not\nclear that all the options have yet been explored (Davidson 2016).\n",
