    "main_text": "Transmission\n1. Transmission\n\nArabic Philosophy was known in the Latin West through translations,\nand, to a small degree, through personal contacts between Christians\nand Muslims, as in the case of Frederick II Hohenstaufen, who was\ndirectly acquainted with a number of Muslim scholars. A small number\nof Christian scholars, such as Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ed and\nRam\u00f3n Llull, knew Arabic themselves and drew on Arabic sources\nwhen composing Latin works. Translations, however, were far more\ninfluential. The first Arabic-Latin translations to transport\nphilosophical material into Latin Europe were the translations of\ntexts on medicine and natural philosophy produced towards the end of\nthe eleventh century in Italy, most of them by the translator\nConstantine the African, who, in contrast to later translators, tried\nto disguise the Arabic origin of his texts (Burnett 2006,\n22\u201324). In Spain, in the first half of the twelfth century,\nseveral important astrological texts were translated, such as\nAlbumasar\u2019s Great Introduction to Astrology, which\nincorporated much material of the Aristotelian tradition (Lemay\n1962).\n\nThe translations of philosophical texts proper, such as by\nal-Kind\u012b, by the anonymous author of the Liber de\ncausis, by al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Isaac Israeli,\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b and Avicenna, but also of Greek works transmitted\nin Arabic, assumed full pace in Toledo in the second half of the\ntwelfth century, where two very prolific translators worked: Gerard of\nCremona and Dominicus Gundisalvi. It is likely that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s treatise Enumeration of the\nSciences, translated twice, by Gerard and Gundisalvi, served as a\nmodel for a coherent translation program. An indication of this is\nthat later Toledan translators such as Alfred of Shareshill, Michael\nScot and Hermannus Alemannus filled in gaps in\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s list of disciplines which the earlier\ntranslators had not covered (Burnett 2001). The translation movement\nwas also influenced by the philosophical preferences of Jewish\nscholars. Gundisalvi worked together with the Jewish scholar Avendauth\nwhen translating Avicenna\u2019s De anima, which Avendauth\nhad recommended for translation, and Gundisalvi\u2019s other\ntranslations may also go back to such recommendations. The impressive\nSpanish translation movement was motivated and fostered by several\nfactors: the personal interest of individual translators; the demand\nfor scientific texts by the French schools; the availability of Arabic\nmanuscripts in cities newly conquered by the Christians; the patronage\nof the archbishop of Toledo; and by clerical interests in promoting\nLatin scientific culture in an Arabic-speaking Christian environment\n(Hasse 2006, 79\u201384).\n\nThe next important phase of the transmission were the translations\nmade in Sicily and southern Italy by several translators associated\nwith the Hohenstaufen or the papal court, the most productive of which\nwere the Averroes translators Michael Scot and William of Luna. It was\nonly about thirty years after Averroes\u2019 death in 1198 that Latin\nAverroes translations became available in the newly developing\nuniversities (Gauthier 1982b). In 1255, the statutes of the Parisian\narts faculty declared all known works of Aristotle mandatory reading\nfor the students \u2013 a very influential move, which much\ncontributed to the rise of Averroes\u2019 commentaries as the\nprincipal secondary literature of Latin university culture.\n\nAfter about 1300, Arabic-Latin translation activities ceased almost\nentirely, to resume again after 1480. The Renaissance translations\nwere mostly produced by Italian Jews from Hebrew versions of Arabic\ntexts, an exception being Andrea Alpago\u2019s Avicenna translations\nfrom Arabic, which were produced in Damascus (Tamani 1992; Burnett\n1999; Hasse 2016, ch. 3). The social context of these translations was\nthe vibrant philosophical culture of Italian universities and\nespecially of Padua, and the patronage of Italian scholars belonging\nto the Italian nobility, who had been educated in these universities. The impact of these Renaissance translations, which is\nweaker than that of the medieval translations, remains largely\nunexplored. It has aleady been shown that the new translations\ninfluenced the logical and zoological discussions of the sixteenth\ncentury (Perfetti 2000, 106\u2013109; Perfetti 2004,\nXVII\u2013XVIII; Burnett 2013). In the second half of the sixteenth\ncentury, interest in Arabic philosophy and sciences declined, and with\nit the Arabic-(Hebrew-)Latin translation movement. At the same time,\nthe new academic study of Arabic culture developed, which was\nmotivated primarily by historical and philological, but not by\nphilosophical interests. From the seventeenth century onwards,\ntranslations into vernacular languages gradually replaced Latin\ntranslations from Arabic (Bobzin 1992).\n\nThe corpus of Arabic philosophical texts translated into Latin was\nsubstantial: A recent publication lists 131 textual items (Burnett\n2005; see Kischlat 2000, 53\u201354, 196\u2013198 for manuscript\ndistribution; on Avicenna translations see Bertolacci 2011 and 2013b;\non translator attribution see Hasse & B\u00fcttner 2018). The\nintroduction of Arabic philosophy into Latin Europe led to the\ntransformation of almost all philosophical disciplines. The influence\nis particularly dominant in natural philosophy, psychology and\nmetaphysics, but is also felt in logic and ethics. The Arabic impact\nis particularly strong in the thirteenth century, but some Arabic\ntraditions, such as Averroes\u2019 intellect theory, reach the high\npoint of their influence in Latin Europe as late as around 1500 (The\ninfluence of Jewish philosophers writing in Arabic, such as Ibn\nGabirol and Maimonides, is not covered in this article).\n",
