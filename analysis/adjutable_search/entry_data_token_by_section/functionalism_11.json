    "main_text": "Constructing Plausible Functional Theories\n4. Constructing Plausible Functional Theories\n\nSo far, the discussion of how to provide functional characterizations\nof individual mental states has been vague, and the examples avowedly\nsimplistic. Is it possible to do better, and, if so, which version of\nfunctionalism is likely to have the greatest success? These questions\nwill be the focus of this section, and separate treatment will be\ngiven to experiential (often called \u2018qualitative\u2019 or\n\u2018phenomenal\u2019) states, such as perceptual experiences and\nbodily sensations, which have a distinctive qualitative character or\n\u201cfeel\u201d, and intentional states, such as thoughts, beliefs,\nand desires, which purport to represent the world in various ways To\nbe sure, there is increasing consensus that experiential states have\nrepresentational contents and intentional states have qualitative\ncharacter and thus that these two groups may not be mutually exclusive\n(see Horgan and Tienson, 2002). Nonetheless I will discuss them\nseparately to focus on what all agree to be the distinctive features\nof each.\n",
