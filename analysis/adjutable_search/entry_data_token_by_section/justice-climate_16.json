    "main_text": "Justice and Climate Policies || Mitigation and Alternative Energy Sources\n7.1 Mitigation and Alternative Energy Sources\n\nThe first concerns other energy sources. In practice these can raise\nquestions of justice. For example, the construction of hydroelectric\nplants can lead to the displacement of peoples from their homes and\nindigenous peoples from their traditional homelands. The use of\nbiofuels can lead to increased food prices as crops are devoted to\nproducing fuel. The use of nuclear energy can lead to health risks.\nThe salient point here is that mitigation (and adaptation) policies\nmay raise ethical questions.\n\nHow should one address these? One suggestion would be that we should\ndraw on the same principles and values that one employs to evaluate climate\nimpacts. So, if, for example, one thinks that climate change is unjust\nin part because it undermines the. enjoyment of individual human\nrights then it would seem to follow that one should seek to implement\nmitigation (and adaptation) policies that honour these individual\nhuman rights. And, if one thinks climate change is unjust, in part,\nbecause it undermines the cultural rights of indigenous peoples then,\nagain, it would seem to follow one should seek to implement mitigation\n(and adaptation) policies that honour these. One\u2019s answer to the\nchallenges posed by the harmful side-effects of some mitigation\npolicies would then be part of one\u2019s overall theory.\n",
