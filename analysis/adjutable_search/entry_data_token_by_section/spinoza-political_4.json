    "main_text": "Basic Features of Spinoza\u2019s Political Philosophy || Hobbes and Spinoza on the Right of Nature\n2.1 Hobbes and Spinoza on the Right of Nature\n\n\nOne of the most notorious features of Spinoza\u2019s political\nthought is his account of natural right. He introduces this concept in\nTTP 16, where he boldly writes:\n\n\nBy the right and order of nature I merely mean the rules determining\nthe nature of each individual thing by which we conceive it is\ndetermined naturally to exist and to behave in a certain way. For\nexample fish are determined by nature to swim and big fish to eat\nlittle ones, and therefore it is by sovereign natural right that fish\nhave possession of the water and that big fish eat small fish. For it\nis certain that nature, considered wholly in itself, has a sovereign\nright to do everything that it can do, i.e., the right of nature\nextends as far as its power extends\u2026since the universal power\nof the whole of nature is nothing but the power of all individual\nthings together, it follows that each individual thing has the\nsovereign right to do everything that it can do, or the right of each\nthing extends so far as its determined power extends. (TTP 16, 195;\ncf. TP 2/4). \n\n\nIn claiming that the right of nature is coextensive with the power\nof nature and that this applies\nmutatis mutandis to the individuals in nature, Spinoza is\nsimply rejecting non-naturalism, rather than making a positive\nnormative claim. So although Spinoza is often seen as subscribing to\nthe view that \u201cmight makes right\u201d (see Barbone and Rice\n2000, 19; McShea 1968, 139), this is misleading if it is\ntaken as a normative claim. In fact, I take it that the coextensivity thesis is not to be\nunderstood as offering a new normative standard; rather, it is\nintended as a denial of any transcendental standard of justice (see\nCurley 1996, 322; Balibar 1998, 59). To say that something is done by\nright in Spinoza\u2019s sense is just to say that there is nothing in\nvirtue of which that action can be judged impermissible. So, even if\nSpinoza\u2019s account implies that Cort\u00e9s conquered the Aztecs by\nright, it does not follow that it was necessarily the right, or\nproper, thing to do (see TP 5/1; see section 2.3).\n\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s brazen denial of natural proscriptions on what one\ncan do roused the ire of early readers (e.g., Pufendorf 1934, 159). Of\ncourse, Thomas Hobbes, Spinoza\u2019s great predecessor, had made a\nsimilar claim. Indeed, Spinoza\u2019s account of natural right is\noften taken as evidence that he is a Hobbesian. Hobbes\u2019 account\nof natural right has been the subject of much interpretative dispute,\nin part because it seems to undergo a shift between his early political\nwritings and Leviathan. In De Cive Hobbes defines\nright as \u201cthe liberty each man has of using his natural faculties\nin accordance with right reason\u201d (1.7). In other words, natural\nright is the liberty to do anything consistent with the natural law\n(ibid. 2.1). This includes the right to do anything that one judges to\nbe necessary for one\u2019s preservation (1.8\u20131.9). Hobbes adds one\nproviso here, which might be called the \u201csincerity clause,\u201d\nnamely that one violates the law of nature, or acts without right, when\none acts in a way that one does not sincerely believe contributes to\none\u2019s preservation (1.10n). And later Hobbes suggests that\nbecause \u201cdrunkenness and cruelty\u201d cannot sincerely be\nthought to contribute to self-preservation, drunken and cruel actions\nare not performed by right, even in the state of nature (ibid., 3.27).\nIn short, as A. G. Wernham puts it, on Hobbes\u2019 view, man\u2019s\nnatural right \u201ccovers only some of his actions\u201d (Wernham\n1958, 14). Specifically, it covers those actions that are not contrary\nto the law of nature.\n\n\nIn Leviathan, however, Hobbes seems to advance an account\nof natural right that is apparently not bound by such normative\nconstraints (Ch. 14). But while it may seem that in the later work\nHobbes strips the concept of natural right of all normative content,\neven the view expressed in Leviathan may be seen to be at odds\nwith a thoroughgoing naturalism. To see this, consider Spinoza\u2019s\nreply to his friend to Jarig Jelles, when asked what sets his views\napart from Hobbes\u2019:\n\n\nWith regard to political theory, the difference between Hobbes and\nmyself, which is the subject of your inquiry, consists in this, that I\nalways preserve the natural right in its entirety [ego naturale jus\nsemper sartum tectum conservo], and I hold that the sovereign\npower in a State has right over a subject only in proportion to the\nexcess of its power over that of a subject (Epistle 50).\n\n\nWhat Spinoza is criticizing here is the Hobbesian view of contracts\n(covenants) or the transference of one\u2019s natural right. The\ntransferability or alienability of one\u2019s natural right to judge\nhow to defend oneself serves as the foundation of Hobbes\u2019\npolitical theory; it allows him to explain the formation of the\ncommonwealth and the legitimacy of the sovereign. In Spinoza\u2019s\nview, however, Hobbes violates naturalism here. By conceiving of\none\u2019s natural right as something like an entitlement that can be\ntransferred, which in turn leads him to drive a wedge between right and\npower in the commonwealth, Hobbes never fully rids his account of the\nvestiges of the juridical tradition that Spinoza sought to\noverturn.\n",
