    "main_text": "Introduction || Critical Legal Studies\n1.1 Critical Legal Studies\n\nThe influential field of Critical Legal Studies, or CLS, that\nemerged in the 1970s played an important role in developing new\napproaches to the study of how the law affects and is affected by\nsocial domination. Influenced by some strands in continental\nphilosophy, CLS scholars showed how legal arguments and concepts could\ncovertly support existing power relations (Douzinas 2000). Early CLS\nscholars such as Duncan Kennedy (2008) and Roberto Magabeira Unger\n(2015) argued that the pattern of social effects produced by legal\ndecisions indicates that the law is not an impartial arbiter but\nlargely an arm of existing hierarchies.\n\nTo see this required new methods of legal analysis that could\ndiscern patterns of implicit assumptions operating across the major\nparadigms of legal reasoning, whether intentionalist, textualist, or\noriginalist. One such assumption is the centrality and legitimacy of\nstare decisis or judicial precedent. CLS argued for setting\nprecedent aside in order to judge decisions in relation to their often\ndisparate impact on different groups. They argued that these\ndifferential impacts were often the result of unexamined assumptions\nstructuring legal argumentation, such as the assumption that\nresponsibility must track conscious intent, or that male power over\nwomen is natural, or that equality claims must be based on\nsameness.\n\nCLS scholars argued that conventions of legal analysis promulgated\nmystifying ideologies that obscured the law\u2019s social embeddedness\nand political function. They argued that we need to take a new look at\nthe concepts of liberalism such as rights, neutrality, and freedom to\nsee whether these concepts were as universally applicable as some\nclaimed. Laws and policies based on liberal ideas, such as meritocracy,\nexacerbated class and racial inequality and injustice. Liberal\napproaches led to these outcomes because they downplayed differences of\nhistory and embodiment and assumed the fungibility of roles such as\ncitizen or rights-holder (Mills 2017).\n\nThe emergence of classical liberalism coincided with the development\nof brutal forms of capitalism, a decrease in women\u2019s property\nrights, and race-based slavery, colonization, and genocide. Was\nliberalism simply negligent, or did its central concepts play a role in\nsanctioning social oppression? Progressives like John Stuart Mill tied\nthe right of self-determination to cultural advance, thus justifying\ncolonial administrations. John Locke\u2019s labor theory of value\nhelped to legitimate the expropriation of indigenous lands on the\ngrounds that many groups relied more on hunting than labor-intensive\nagriculture. Reading the central arguments of liberalism in light of\ntheir diverse impact on different groups raised new questions about\nliberalism\u2019s relationship to domination.\n\nThe work of legal theorist Derrick Bell was key in bringing a CLS\napproach to the topic of race. Bell developed a series of interpretive\narguments focused on the reforms won by civil rights cases to show that\nthe successes were generally contained to those that did not threaten\nwhite entitlement (Bell 1987). Corporate elites used the mandate for\ndiversity, for example, as a means to create a diverse managerial class\nmore effective at controlling the broad multi-racial low-paid\nworkforce. When establishing racism required evidence of intentional\nattitudes or conscious conspiracies, it was all but impossible to\nredress cross generational wealth disparities based on race or the\nstructural forms of anti-black racism so deeply embedded in such\ninstitutions as education, the justice system, health care, housing,\nand the local, state and national organizations intended to serve\ndemocratic representation. Thus, civil rights reforms left racism\n\u201cfirmly entrenched,\u201d as Bell put it (1987, 4). Forced to\nwork with liberal concepts, progressive civil rights legislation ended\nup providing cover for the continuation of racial divides in housing,\nwage scales, and education while the criminal justice system has become\neven more lethal to Black and Brown populations.\n",
