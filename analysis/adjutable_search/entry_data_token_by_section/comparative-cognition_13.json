For example, Alex Taylor and colleagues argue that\ncomparative cognition researchers are currently too focused on whether\nanimals succeed at a particular experimental task (Taylor, Bastos, et\nal. 2022). In their view, the problem with this approach is that it\nfails to adequately constrain the hypothesis space\u2014there are\nsimply too many plausible hypotheses that could account for such\nsuccess. Given this, researchers should instead seek to identify\n\n\nthe full range of information processing patterns including errors,\nlimits, and biases (whether neutral, adaptive, or maladaptive) shown\nby an agent, so as to constrain the cognitive hypothesis space\neffectively. (Taylor, Bastos, et al. 2022: 3)\n\n\nTaylor and colleagues refer to this as \u201csignature testing\u201d\n(in contrast to \u201csuccess testing\u201d). A\n\u201csignature\u201d is any pattern of evidence that constrains the\nhypothesis space with respect to a phenomenon of interest (it can be\nweakly or strongly diagnostic depending on how much it constrains the\nhypothesis space). A successful hypothesis should be able to account\nfor all signatures of a cognitive process, not just an animal\u2019s\nsuccessful performance on an experimental task.\n\nStarzak and Gray (2021) similarly urge researchers to develop more\nfine-grained accounts of how to conceptualize cognitive phenomena. For\nexample, with respect to the cognitive phenomenon of causal\nunderstanding, they write:\n\n\nin thinking about the nature of causal understanding we should think\nabout the extent to which organisms can differ with respect to the\nkind of information they can pick up; with respect to the different\nsources of causal information they can exploit; with respect to the\nway they can process this information and integrate different types of\ninformation or information stemming from different sources; and with\nrespect to the flexibility with which they can use this information to\nguide behavior. (2021: 9)\n\n\nLike signature testing, this multidimensional approach is more nuanced\nthan asking whether an animal \u201chas causal understanding\u201d\ntout court. It also helps address the issue that associative\nlearning and complex cognition are not necessarily mutually exclusive\n (section 2.2).\n Rather than asking whether an experimental result is best explained\nby appealing to associative learning or causal understanding, one can\nappeal to both accounts: associative learning might explain how causal\ninformation is acquired in some cases and cognitive models might\nexplain how causal information is integrated. Researchers have\nadvocated for a similar multidimensional approach in the context of\nwork on behavioral innovation (Brown 2022) and animal consciousness\n(Birch, Schnell, & Clayton 2020, see section on consciousness in\nentry on\n animal cognition).\n The upshot is that a more fine-grained approach to cognition and\nbehavior may help constrain the hypothesis space in such a way that\navoids major problems of underdetermination.\n",
