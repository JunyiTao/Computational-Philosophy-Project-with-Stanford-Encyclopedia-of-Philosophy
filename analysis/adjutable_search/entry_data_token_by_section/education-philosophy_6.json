Charges\nof being \u201ctoo ivory tower and theory-oriented\u201d are found\nalongside \u201ctoo focused on practice and too atheoretical\u201d;\nbut in light of the views of John Dewey and William James that the\nfunction of theory is to guide intelligent practice and\nproblem-solving, it is becoming more fashionable to hold that the\n\u201ctheory v. practice\u201d dichotomy is a false one. (For an\nilluminating account of the historical development of educational\nresearch and its tribulations, see Lagemann 2000.)\n\nA similar trend can be discerned with respect to the long warfare\nbetween two rival groups of research methods\u2014on one hand\nquantitative/statistical approaches to research, and on the other hand\nthe qualitative/ethnographic family. (The choice of labels here is not\nentirely risk-free, for they have been contested; furthermore the\nfirst approach is quite often associated with\n\u201cexperimental\u201d studies, and the latter with \u201ccase\nstudies\u201d, but this is an over-simplification.) For several\ndecades these two rival methodological camps were treated by\nresearchers and a few philosophers of education as being rival\nparadigms (Kuhn\u2019s ideas, albeit in a very loose form, have been\ninfluential in the field of educational research), and the dispute\nbetween them was commonly referred to as \u201cthe paradigm\nwars\u201d. In essence the issue at stake was epistemological:\nmembers of the quantitative/experimental camp believed that only their\nmethods could lead to well-warranted knowledge claims, especially\nabout the causal factors at play in educational phenomena, and on the\nwhole they regarded qualitative methods as lacking in rigor; on the\nother hand the adherents of qualitative/ethnographic approaches held\nthat the other camp was too \u201cpositivistic\u201d and was\noperating with an inadequate view of causation in human\naffairs\u2014one that ignored the role of motives and reasons,\npossession of relevant background knowledge, awareness of cultural\nnorms, and the like. Few if any commentators in the \u201cparadigm\nwars\u201d suggested that there was anything prohibiting the use of\nboth approaches in the one research program\u2014provided that if\nboth were used, they were used only sequentially or in parallel, for\nthey were underwritten by different epistemologies and hence could not\nbe blended together. But recently the trend has been towards\nrapprochement, towards the view that the two methodological families\nare, in fact, compatible and are not at all like paradigms in the\nKuhnian sense(s) of the term; the melding of the two approaches is\noften called \u201cmixed methods research\u201d, and it is growing\nin popularity. (For more detailed discussion of these\n\u201cwars\u201d see Howe 2003 and Phillips 2009.)\n\nThe most lively contemporary debates about education research,\nhowever, were set in motion around the turn of the millennium when the\nUS Federal Government moved in the direction of funding only\nrigorously scientific educational research\u2014the kind that could\nestablish causal factors which could then guide the development of\npractically effective policies. (It was held that such a causal\nknowledge base was available for medical decision-making.) The\ndefinition of \u201crigorously scientific\u201d, however, was\ndecided by politicians and not by the research community, and it was\ngiven in terms of the use of a specific research method\u2014the net\neffect being that the only research projects to receive Federal\nfunding were those that carried out randomized controlled experiments\nor field trials (RFTs). It has become common over the last decade to\nrefer to the RFT as the \u201cgold standard\u201d methodology.\n\nThe National Research Council (NRC)\u2014an arm of the US National\nAcademies of Science\u2014issued a report, influenced by\npostpostivistic philosophy of science (NRC 2002), that argued that\nthis criterion was far too narrow. Numerous essays have appeared\nsubsequently that point out how the \u201cgold standard\u201d\naccount of scientific rigor distorts the history of science, how the\ncomplex nature of the relation between evidence and policy-making has\nbeen distorted and made to appear overly simple (for instance the role\nof value-judgments in linking empirical findings to policy directives\nis often overlooked), and qualitative researchers have insisted upon\nthe scientific nature of their work. Nevertheless, and possibly\nbecause it tried to be balanced and supported the use of RFTs in some\nresearch contexts, the NRC report has been the subject of symposia in\nfour journals, where it has been supported by a few and attacked from\na variety of philosophical fronts: Its authors were positivists, they\nerroneously believed that educational inquiry could be value neutral\nand that it could ignore the ways in which the exercise of power\nconstrains the research process, they misunderstood the nature of\neducational phenomena, and so on. This cluster of issues continues to\nbe debated by educational researchers and by philosophers of education\nand of science, and often involves basic topics in philosophy of\nscience: the constitution of warranting evidence, the nature of\ntheories and of confirmation and explanation, etc. Nancy\nCartwright\u2019s important recent work on causation, evidence, and\nevidence-based policy adds layers of both philosophical sophistication\nand real world practical analysis to the central issues just discussed\n(Cartwright & Hardie 2012, Cartwright 2013; cf. Kvernbekk 2015 for\nan overview of the controversies regarding evidence in the education\nand philosophy of education literatures). \n",
