    "main_text": "Forms of Extended Discourse\n4. Forms of Extended Discourse\n\nRicoeur examined a number of different forms of extended discourse,\nbeginning with metaphorical discourse. Like the talk about symbols he\nhad explored earlier a live metaphor is a kind of discourse that says\nmore than one thing at the same time. Live metaphors are the product\nof sentences, not the result of substituting one word for another for\ndecorative or rhetorical effect. They presuppose a kind of odd\npredication, a \u201cmetaphorical twist\u201d. Unlike propositions\nwhich say something is or is not the case, a live metaphor says\n\u201cis\u201d and \u201cis not\u201d at the same time, leading\npossibly to a redescription of reality. As creative instances of the\nuse of language, live metaphors can die and be absorbed into the\ndictionary (a watch runs). Live metaphors can also extend beyond a\nsingle sentence as in the case of poetic discourse. Poetic discourse\nis thus a use of language that redescribes reality. Its truth is more\na matter of manifestation than of coherence or correspondence with\nwhat is assumed to be external reality. In an important sense, this\nexperienced truth is the basis for talk about coherence and\ncorrespondence, yet paradoxically metaphorical discourse always\npresupposes an already existing language that it can make use of. In\nthis sense, we are never at the origin of language. We can question\nback toward this origin but never reach it, since we always must begin\nby making use of existing language to question language. Philosophers\nof the fullness of language therefore always begin as having already\nbegun.\n\nNarrative discourse is another form of extended discourse investigated\nby Ricoeur. It is a use language that allows us to make practical\nsense of human action and time. Ordinary language already contains\nconcepts that apply to action\u2014those of intentions, motives,\ncauses, reasons, acts, consequences, agents and patients, for\nexample\u2014just as it contains concepts applicable to time: past,\npresent, future, now, then, when. Narrative discourse configures such\nheterogeneous concepts into a discourse that locates actions in a time\nwhere one thing happens not just after something else but because of\nsomething else in a followable story or history. It refigures physical\nevents as narrative events, events which make sense because they tell\nwhat happens in a story or history. But because narratives have\nendings or must end, they never fully exhaust time or the possible\nlong-term meaning of action. Through their plots they are always a\nsynthesis of heterogeneous concepts into a kind of discordant\nconcordance which configures the episodes of the story into a told\nstory. In so doing they resolve practically if not theoretically the\nconflict between time understood as a lived now\u2014this present\nwhich has a past and a future\u2014and cosmic time conceived of as a\nsequence of points, where any point can be a now point defined not in\nterms of its past and future but merely in terms of points that come\nbefore and after it. Narrative interweaves these two perspectives on\ntime into human time without ever fully resolving the aporias raised\nby thinking about time in time.\n\nReligious discourse, at least as found in the Hebrew and Christian\nbiblical tradition takes many forms: hymns, laws, narratives,\nparables, prophecy, wisdom sayings. What they have in common that\nspecifies them as religious discourse is that they are all forms of\npoetic discourse and they all in their own way \u201cname\u201d God.\nWithin their setting within the biblical canon they do so through\ntheir constituting a polyphony that enables the religious traditions\nthat use these texts both to identify and to legitimate themselves\nthrough a kind of hermeneutic circle. That is, such texts are sacred\nto traditions which take them as legitimating the tradition founded on\nthese texts, through their reading and interpreting of such texts.\n\nPolitical discourse is a particularly fragile form of extended\ndiscourse since the political dimension of human existence is one\nrealm among others like commerce or the arts and also the one that\ncontains all the others. It is an especially rhetorical form of\ndiscourse in the sense of being discourse that aims at persuasion.\nPersuasion is necessary because there is no final resolution of the\nconflicts that can arise over questions about the best form of\ngovernment or whether there should be, say, a law, what that law ought\nto be, or whether laws are required in this case at all. That politics\nalso is about power, the power to make decisions and command others\nadds to the fragility of such discourse in that politics is always\nbased on a revocable willingness to live together. This leads to a\ndialectic of ideology and utopia in Ricoeur\u2019s political\nphilosophy. Ideologies both claim to legitimate the positions of those\nin power or those seeking power and cover the gap between what they\nassert and the way things actually are. Utopian thinking, in return,\nimagines a world without or beyond ideology. It sometimes enables\npeople to overthrow particularly ruinous forms of ideology, only to\nfall back into a dependence on ideology since utopia exists\n\u201cnowhere\u201d. Yet politics is necessary because it makes\npossible life together. That it always takes place between these two\npoles of ideology and utopia is another example of a mediating term\nbetween opposed poles in Ricoeur\u2019s hermeneutics.\n",
