    "main_text": "Marriage and Morals\n3. Marriage and Morals\n\nThe idea that marriage has a special moral status and entails fixed\nmoral obligations is widespread\u2014and philosophically\ncontroversial. Marriage is a legal contract, although an anomalous one\n(see 4.1); as the idea of it as a contract has taken hold, questions\nhave arisen as to how far its obligations should be subject to\nindividual choice. The contractual view of marriage implies that\nspouses can choose marital obligations to suit their interests.\nHowever, to some, the value of marriage consists precisely in the\nlimitations it sets on individual choice in the service of a greater\ngood: thus, Hegel commented that arranged marriage is the most ethical\nform of marriage because it subordinates personal choice to the\ninstitution. The institutional view holds that the purpose of the\ninstitution defines its obligations, taking precedence over\nspouses\u2019 desires, either in the service of a procreative union\nor to protect spousal love, in the two most prominent forms of this\nview. These theories have implications for the moral status of\nextra-marital sex and divorce, as well as the purpose of marriage.\n",
