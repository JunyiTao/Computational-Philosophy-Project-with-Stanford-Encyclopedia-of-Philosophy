    "main_text": "The 19th Century: Liberals and Positivists\n7. The 19th Century: Liberals and Positivists\n\nThe 19th century was a time of upheaval in Mexico. In 1808\nNapoleon invaded Spain and King Ferdinand VII abdicated the throne,\nforcing the citizens of Spanish America to re-examine the concept of\nsovereignty. Specifically, they wondered whether, in the absence of a\nmonarch, the colonies possessed the right to govern themselves until\nthe monarch returned to the throne.\n\nAppealing to the philosophy of the Enlightenment\u2014though not\nalways explicitly\u2014several Mexican thinkers and political\nactivists argued that the colonies did possess the right to\nself-government. Such was the case of Miguel Hidalgo\n(1753\u20131811), one of the fathers of Mexican Independence. Hidalgo\nwas well known for his predilection for French ideas and for his\nopposition to Scholastic theology, as is demonstrated in his\nDisertaci\u00f3n sobre el verdadero m\u00e9todo de estudiar\nteolog\u00eda escol\u00e1stica (1784). Francisco Severo\nMaldonado (1775\u20131832) was another philosophically-minded priest\nwho wrote in favor of independence and about the philosophical\nfoundations of nationalism.\n\nAfter Mexico won its independence in 1821, and throughout the\n19th century, an intense debate took place regarding the\ntenets of liberal philosophy and its application to Mexican reality.\nLiberals wanted the Mexican Constitution to resemble the Constitution\nof the United States, which defended individual rights, freedom of\nspeech, and freedom of press. They also believed in the separation of\nchurch and state, and argued that the wealth and land owned by the\nMexican Church should be expropriated to promote economic development.\nLiberals believed that everyone is equal before the law and they tried\nto erase the racial and cultural inequality that prevailed in the\nnation, particularly the position of indigenous communities. Among the\nauthors who defended liberal ideas were Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luis\nMora (1794\u20131850), Melchor Ocampo (1814\u20131851), Ignacio\nRam\u00edrez (1818\u20131879), and Ignacio Manuel Altamirano\n(1834\u20131893). (See the related entry on\n liberalism in Latin America.)\n\nThere were also influential conservatives who believed that Mexico\nought to preserve its Spanish heritage, such as Lucas Alam\u00e1n\n(1792\u20131853). While conservatives also promoted legislation to\nprotect indigenous peoples and local industry, many argued that the\nCatholic tradition was needed to maintain national cohesion. So, while\nEnlightenment philosophy began to spread throughout the Americas in\nthe 19th century, some notable Scholastics remained, such\nas Clemente de Jes\u00fas Mungu\u00eda (1810\u20131868), author\nof Del pensamiento y su enunciaci\u00f3n (1852).\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the debate between\nliberals and conservatives had important political ramifications. On\nthe one hand, Mexican liberals had elected the first president of\nindigenous ancestry, Benito Juarez, who helped establish liberal\nreform throughout Mexico in the 1850s. On the other hand, from 1862 to\n1867, conservatives supported the pro-French Mexican monarchy, headed\nby Maximilian of Hapsburg, ousting Juarez for a time. After the\ncollapse of the Empire and the execution of Maximilian, the\nConservative Party lost most of its influence as it was associated\nwith supporting foreign powers.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, Mexican intellectuals\nentertained a wide variety of philosophical schools, including\nliberalism, utilitarianism, sensualism, materialism, and socialism.\nSome also developed anarchist and romantic ideas, such as Juan\nNepomuceno Adorno, a romantic whose La armon\u00eda del\nuniverso (1862) proposes a deistic philosophy and a utopian\nconception of human nature and society. But the main school of\nphilosophy that dominated the second half of the century was\npositivism, understood broadly to encompass authors as varied as\nAuguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, Hyppolite Taine, and John Stuart\nMill.\n\nThe main representative of positivism in Mexico was Gabino Barreda\n(1818\u20131881). In his \u201cOraci\u00f3n\nc\u00edvica\u201d(1867), Barreda offers an interpretation of\nMexican history inspired by Comte\u2019s philosophy of history,\naccording to which history develops in three stages\u2014the\nreligious, the metaphysical, and the scientific. Barreda believed that\nthe victory of the Liberal Party was ultimately grounded in positivist\ntheses. He also believed that national reform should not be founded on\nreligion or speculative metaphysics, but on the experimental methods\nof science. With this in mind, he promoted education reform that\neliminated theology and speculative philosophy from the curriculum in\npublic schools, thus initiating a long debate on the role of\nphilosophy in public education that continues today.\n\nFor Mexican positivists the challenge was to reconcile freedom and\norder, both moral and natural. In his essay \u201cDe la\neducaci\u00f3n moral\u201d (1863), Barreda sustained that freedom\ndoes not amount to the freedom to do whatever one wants (i.e., freedom\nfrom constraint). True freedom is always constrained by the law, just\nas a free falling object falls according to the laws of\nnature. Likewise, moral freedom and progress is constrained by\nthe moral law and must be consistent with the laws of science.\n\nIn addition to Comte\u2019s philosophy, Mexican intellectuals applied\nSpencer\u2019s social evolutionism to theories about Mexican history\nand society, as can be seen in the works of Justo Sierra\n(1848\u20131912) and Francisco Bulnes (1847\u20131924). According to\nsocial evolutionism, nations are like animal species: their organs\nhave evolved to fulfill specific purposes, primarily survival. In his\nbook El porvenir de las naciones hispanoamericanas (1899),\nBulnes claimed that Mexico would have to make major changes to survive\nin its struggle against the Anglo-Saxons. From a political point of\nview, Spencer\u2019s social evolutionism was the foundation of the\nview that progress in Mexico would result from a slow, deliberately\nplanned evolution, not another revolution. For instance, Justo\nSierra\u2019s Evoluci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica del pueblo\nmexicano (1902) was used by some to justify the ongoing\ndictatorship of General Porfirio D\u00edaz, who ruled Mexico for\nalmost three decades leading up to the Mexican Revolution of 1910.\n\nIn the fields of logic and epistemology, Mill\u2019s influence was\nwidely accepted. Perhaps most influential in these areas was Porfirio\nParra\u2019s (1845\u20131912) Nuevo sistema de l\u00f3gica\ninductiva y deductiva (1903), in which he defends an idealist\nversion of empiricism.\n",
