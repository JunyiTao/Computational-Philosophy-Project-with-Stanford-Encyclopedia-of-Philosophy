    "main_text": "Teleology or Deontology?\n15. Metaethics\n\nIt has seemed to a number of Kant\u2019s interpreters that it is\nimportant to determine whether Kant\u2019s moral philosophy was\nrealist, anti-realist or something else (e.g. a constructivist). The\nissue is tricky because terms such as \u201crealism,\u201d\n\u201canti-realism\u201d and \u201cconstructivism\u201d are terms\nof art, so it is all too easy for interlocutors to talk past one\nanother.\n\nOne relevant issue is whether Kant\u2019s views commit him to the\nthesis that moral judgments are beliefs, and so apt to be evaluated\nfor their truth or falsity (or are \u201ctruth apt\u201d).\n\nOne might have thought that this question is quite easy to settle. At\nthe basis of morality, Kant argued, is the Categorical Imperative, and\nimperatives are not truth apt. It makes little sense to ask whether\n\u201cLeave the gun, take the cannoli.\u201d is true. But, in fact,\nthe question is not at all easy. For one thing, moral judgments such\nas \u201cLying is wrong\u201d might well be best analyzed according\nto Kant\u2019s views as \u201cThe Categorical Imperative commands us\nnot to lie\u201d, and this judgment is not an imperative, but a\nreport about what an imperative commands. Thus while at the foundation\nof morality there would be an imperative which is not truth apt,\nparticular moral judgments themselves would describe what that\nimperative rules out and so would themselves be truth apt.\n\nPhilosophers such as R.M. Hare, however, have taken Kant\u2019s view\nto be that moral judgments are not truth apt. Although on the surface\nmoral judgments can look as if they describe a moral world, they are,\nas Hare reads Kant, \u201cprescriptions\u201d, not\n\u201cdescriptions\u201d. This is not, in his view, to say that\nKant\u2019s ethics portrays moral judgments as lacking objectivity.\nObjectivity, according to Hare, is to be understood as universality,\nand the Categorical Imperative prescribes universally.\n\nA second issue that has received considerable attention is whether\nKant is a metaethical constructivist or realist.\n\nConstructivism in metaethics is the view that moral truths are, or are\ndetermined by, the outcomes of actual or hypothetical procedures of\ndeliberation or choice. Many who interpret Kant as a constructivist\nclaim that his analysis of \u201cduty\u201d and \u201cgood\nwill\u201d reveals that if there are moral requirements then the\nagents who are bound to them have autonomy of the will (Rawls 1980;\nKorsgaard 1996; O\u2019Neil 1989; Reath 2006; Hill 1989a, 1989b,\n2001; Cureton 2013, 2014; Engstrom 2009). Autonomy, in this sense,\nmeans that such agents are both authors and subjects of the moral law\nand, as such, are not bound by any external requirements that may\nexist outside of our wills. Instead, we are only subject to moral\nrequirements that we impose on ourselves through the operation of our\nown reason independently of our natural desires and inclinations. The\ncommon error of previous ethical theories, including sentimentalism,\negoism and rationalism, is that they failed to recognize that morality\npresupposes that we have autonomy of the will. These theories\nmistakenly held that our only reasons to be moral derive from\nhypothetical imperatives about how to achieve given moral ends that\nexist independently of the activity of reason itself (for a discussion\nof Kant\u2019s more specific objections to previous ethical theories,\nsee Schneewind 2009). On these interpretations, Kant is a skeptic\nabout arbitrary authorities, such as God, natural feelings, intrinsic\nvalues or primitive reasons that exist independently of us. Only\nreason itself has genuine authority over us, so we must exercise our\nshared powers of reasoned deliberation, thought and judgment, guided\nby the Categorical Imperative as the most basic internal norm of\nreason, to construct more specific moral requirements. Kantians in\nthis camp, however, disagree about how this rational procedure should\nbe characterized.\n\nOther commentators interpret Kant as a robust moral realist (Ameriks\n2003; Wood 1999; Langton 2007; Kain 2004). According to these\nphilosophers, Kant\u2019s theory, properly presented, begins with the\nclaim that rational nature is an objective, agent-neutral and\nintrinsic value. The moral law then specifies how we should regard and\ntreat agents who have this special status. Autonomy of the will, on\nthis view, is a way of considering moral principles that are grounded\nin the objective value of rational nature and whose authority is thus\nindependent of the exercise of our wills or rational capacities.\n\nSome interpreters of Kant, most notably Korsgaard (1996), seem to\naffirm a kind of quietism about metaethics by rejecting many of the\nassumptions that contemporary metaethical debates rest on. For\nexample, some of these philosophers seem not to want to assert that\nmoral facts and properties just are the outcomes of deliberative\nprocedures. Rather, they seem more eager to reject talk of facts and\nproperties as unnecessary, once a wholly acceptable and defensible\nprocedure is in place for deliberation. That is, the whole framework\nof facts and properties suggests that there is something we need to\nmoor our moral conceptions to \u201cout there\u201d in reality, when\nin fact what we only need a route to a decision. Once we are more\nsensitive to the ethical concerns that really matter to us as rational\nagents, we will find that many of the questions that animate\nmetaethicists turn out to be non-questions or of only minor\nimportance. Others have raised doubts, however, about whether Kantians\ncan so easily avoid engaging in metaethical debates (Hussain &\nShaw 2013).\n",
