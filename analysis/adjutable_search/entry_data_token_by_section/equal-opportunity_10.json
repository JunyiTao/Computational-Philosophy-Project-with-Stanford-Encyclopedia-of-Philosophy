    "main_text": "The Scope of Equality of Opportunity || Goods Scope of Equality of Opportunity\n10.1 Goods Scope of Equality of Opportunity\n\nAs much of the preceding material indicates, it is familiar to think\nof the application of Equality in relation to socially advantageous\nroles and positions involving a competitive application process, the\nparadigm of such cases being jobs and competitive admissions processes\nin education. We could think about this in terms of persons enjoying\nEquality of Opportunity for particular roles (for example, for a given\nteaching job) or for a type of role (for example, for teaching jobs in\ngeneral), or for roles more generally (for example, jobs in general).\nEquality of Opportunity is also sometimes used to refer to\npersons\u2019 access to goods other than socially advantageous roles\nsuch as healthcare. One example of healthcare concerns that might be\nframed in terms of Equality of Opportunity is the matter of the\nso-called \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d in the UK. This refers to the\nfact that where one lives in the UK can sometimes determine how\nreadily available certain drugs and treatments are under the National\nHealth Service. If citizens in one county have access to drugs that\nare far less available through the service to citizens in another\ncounty, this might be framed as a failure of Equality of Opportunity\nfor healthcare. Similar claims might be made about the distribution of\nmany other goods like this, which do not take the form of competition\nfor roles and positions, but which involve the distribution of scarce\nresources according to a given eligibility criteria. When people claim\nthat there is a failure of Equality of Opportunity, they may not be\nclaiming that everyone should have equal amounts of the good, or even\nequal access to the good, but that the distribution ought to be\ndetermined by justified criteria of eligibility, rather than by other\nfactors which are deemed illegitimate. So, for instance, in the\npostcode lottery case, the claim might be that healthcare should be\ndistributed according to need, rather than according to the\narbitrary fact of which county one happens to live in. As such, even\nthough this application of the notion of Equality of Opportunity\npertains to goods other than competitive application practices, it\ninvolves the same idea\u2014that some factors are legitimate\ndeterminants of the distribution and others are not.\n\nWhilst Equality of Opportunity is very commonly understood to have a\nscope that encompasses socially advantageous positions that are part\nof formalized institutions\u2014such as jobs and other institutional\nroles, and places in education\u2014it might also be understood more\nbroadly, to encompass more informal \u201cpositions\u201d in society\nwhich have value or constitute social advantages, including, for\ninstance, to competitions for prizes and honours. Still more broadly,\nthe notion of Equality of Opportunity might be applied to much less\nformalized social relations that constitute, or lead to, advantages.\nIt might be applied, for instance, to one\u2019s opportunity to be a\nparent, or even one\u2019s opportunity for marriage. Again, the\nnotion of Equality of Opportunity here can be used in a way that ties\nit closely to the institutional or political measures that might be\ntaken to ensure fair access to certain goods or relationships, or it\nmight be applied more broadly to take account of the wider social\nexplanation for some persons enjoying a good where others do not. For\ninstance, some conceptions of Equality of Opportunity for parenthood\nor for marriage will hold that persons enjoy equal opportunities when\nthere are no state-instituted barriers against certain persons\nmarrying or, say, adopting children. Other conceptions will go\nfurther, and contend that Equality of Opportunity requires, for\ninstance, subsidizing IVF treatment and adoption processes, or\nwidening access to marriage procedures. And, indeed, there will be\nsome conceptions which go still further and hold that social norms and\nthe behaviour of one\u2019s fellow citizens can themselves prove\nbarriers to Equality of Opportunity. To illustrate, suppose we can\nclearly identify a level of bias against certain members of a\nparticular racialized group in dating apps, leading to those\npersons\u2019 faring less well at matching with others. It might be\nargued that this reflects a lack of Equality of Opportunity for such\nindividuals to form romantic relationships.\n",
