    "main_text": "Cosmogony and Cosmology || Astronomical System\n4.2 Astronomical System\n\nPhilolaus\u2019 astronomical system is famous as the first to move the\nearth from the center of the universe and make it an orbiting planet\ninstead. Copernicus referred to Philolaus as his precursor in the\npreface to his De Revolutionibus (see Kahn 2001, 26 for\nreferences). Unlike Copernicus, however, Philolaus did not replace the\ngeocentric with a heliocentric universe. The central fire rather than\nthe sun is at the center of Philolaus\u2019 cosmos. The heavenly bodies are\narranged in ten concentric circles around this central fire. Beginning\nfrom the outside, the fixed stars come first, then the five planets,\nthe sun, the moon, the earth and a mysterious counter-earth. The\nsystem can account for the basic phenomena with elegant simplicity.\nThe fixed stars serve as the backdrop against which the other heavenly\nbodies move. All of the bodies have only one circular motion around\nthe central fire, from west to east. The moon completes its orbit in\nabout a month, the sun in a year and each of the planets has its own\nperiod of revolution. Thus, bodies move more slowly, the farther\nremoved they are from the central fire,and the fixed stars probably\ndid not move at all. These motions account for the basic apparent\nmovement of the sun, moon and planets through the zodiac, although\nthere is no attempt to explain more sophisticated planetary phenomena\nsuch as retrograde motion, where the planet appears to stop and move\nbackward before continuing its progress through the zodiac. Retrograde\nmotion was only first addressed almost a century after Philolaus by\nEudoxus. The earth has by far the fastest motion, completing a circuit\nof the central fire in 24 hours. It is the motion of the earth that\naccounts for the apparent daily motion of the sun across the sky and\nhence for night and day. The much faster moving earth, which rotates\non its axis so as to keep our side always turned away from the central\nfire and counter-earth (see below), leaves the sun behind so that day\nlasts as long as the earth is facing the sun, and night occurs when\nthe earth turns away from the sun as it moves around the central\nfire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system is the result of a combination of a priori\nprinciples and reliance on observation. Philolaus is the first to\nincorporate all five planets commonly known in antiquity into an\nastronomical scheme in the correct order, which indicates that he was\naware of the most up-to-date astronomical data (Eudemus as cited in\nSimplicius, in De Caelo 471.4; Huffman 1993, 260; Zhmud 2012:\n336\u20137 thinks that Eudemus is referring to an earlier Pythagorean\nsystem). On the other hand, there are a number of features that appear\nto be explained by appeal to a priori principles of order.\nThus, moving the earth from the center of the universe did not serve\nto explain astronomical data better. There is no explicit reason given\nfor moving the earth; Aristotle reports that some others (Platonists?;\nsee Kingsley 1995, 175\u201380) thought it should be moved because\nfire was thought to be a \u201cbetter\u201d element than earth and\nhence to belong at the center of the cosmos, which is a position of\nhonor (Arist., De Caelo 293b2). We are explicitly told that\nthe Pythagoreans accepted one of the premises of this argument, that\nthe center is the most important part of the cosmos (Arist., De\nCaelo 293b2\u20133), and it is likely that the whole argument\nshould be assigned to Philolaus (Huffman 2007, 76\u201380). This is\nconsistent with the evidence of Frs. 7 and 17, which clearly indicate\nthat the cosmogony began in the center. Philolaus may have assigned\nfire the position of honor, because of the analogy with human birth,\nsince he argued that the human embryo develops from the hot (see 5.3\nbelow). The case of the counter-earth is more complicated. Aristotle\nsuggests that it was introduced for a priori reasons: to\nraise the number of heavenly bodies around the central fire from nine\nto ten, which the Pythagoreans regarded as the perfect number (Arist.,\nMetaph. 986a8\u201312; on the other hand Zhmud 2012:407\nargues that the number ten had no particular significance for the\nPythagoreans). Some scholars have objected that, if we count the\ncentral fire, the introduction of the counter earth makes eleven\nbodies in Philolaus\u2019 system (Burch 1954, 284; Kingsley 1995, 174); the\nancient evidence consistently talks in terms of bodies arranged or\nmoving around the central fire, however, and obviously the\ncentral fire cannot be counted as one of these (Aetius 2.7.7; Arist.,\nFr. 203 and Metaph. 986a10), so that Aristotle\u2019s explanation\nretains considerable plausibility (Burch 1954 suggests that the\ncounter-earth was introduced as a counter-weight to the earth, so that\nthe center of gravity of the cosmos would coincide with the spatial\ncenter, but there is no evidence that Philolaus had the concept of a\ncenter of gravity). On the other hand, Aristotle also comments that\nthe counter-earth was introduced to explain lunar eclipses (De\nCaelo 293b18\u201325). Graham has recently made a convincing case that\nthe counter-earth could in fact account for eclipses of the moon at\ndawn and dusk, which otherwise would be inexplicable on Philolaus\u2019\nmodel (Graham 2015, see also Graham 2014: 57\u201360). Graham speculates\nthat the term for counter-earth in Greek (antichthon), may\nrefer to the counter-earth\u2019s \u201ctaking the place\u201d\n(anti) of the earth in accounting for these lunar eclipses,\nwhich cannot be explained by the interposition of the earth (Graham\n2015: 229). Thus, one of the main features of Philolaus\u2019 system that\nhad been thought to show its non-scientific character, may, in fact,\nbe motivated by an attempt to make the system better explain the\nphenomena. The doxography also assigns the counter earth to the\nPythagorean Hicetas (DK 50A2; cf. Mansfeld 2010a: 90\u201393). The\nfixed stars do not literally move in Philolaus\u2019 system but they, like\nthe planets, sun and moon, have an apparent diurnal movement caused by\nthe motion of the earth. Even Philolaus\u2019 basic assumption that the\ncosmos is spherical (Frs. 7 and 17) may be based on Parmenides\u2019 a\npriori arguments that reality is similar to a sphere in\nperfection (Fr. 8.42\u201344).There is no explicit statement about\nthe shape of the earth in Philolaus\u2019 system and some have supposed it\nto be flat (Burch 1954: 272\u2013273). Analogy with the cosmos\nsuggests that it was spherical as well and several of Aristotle\u2019s\ndescriptions of the Philolaic system show that it was (Dicks 1970:\n72\u201373). Philolaus appears to have believed that there was also\nfire at the periphery of the cosmic sphere and that the sun was a\nglass-like body which transmitted the light and heat of this fire to\nthe earth, an account of the sun which shows connections to\nEmpedocles; Philolaus also posited a great year of 59 years in which\nthe lunar and solar cycles were reconciled (Huffman 1993, 266\u201370\nand 276\u2013279). Philolaus\u2019 great year may be connected to the\ndoctrine of the periodic return of all things, which Dicaearchus\nassigns to the Pythagoreans (Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras\n19), which may be in turn a generalization of reincarnation (Riedweg\n2005, 63). \n\nAs in the case of Philolaus\u2019 cosmogony, there is considerable\ncontroversy about the precise nature of Philolaus\u2019 astronomy. The\na priori features, as well as other testimonia stating that\nPhilolaus believed that the moon was inhabited by creatures fifteen\ntimes more powerful than those on the earth (Aetius 2.30.1 = DK 44\nA20), have suggested to some that Philolaus\u2019 system is largely a\nfantasy and has nothing to do with empirical astronomy (Furley 1987,\n58). Burkert argues, moreover, that the apparent coherence of the\nastronomical system is destroyed, because the fixed stars, which serve\nas the backdrop for the motions of the heavenly bodies described\nabove, were not in fact stationary but moved with the fastest motion\nso that, without a fixed backdrop, the whole system dissolves into\nchaos (1972a, 340); he argues that Philolaus\u2019 astronomy is primarily\nof mythological and religious significance (1972a, 348). However, more\nrecent assessments argue that Philolaus\u2019 astronomical system was a\nserious attempt to account for the phenomena and the most successful\nsuch attempt of his time (Huffman 1993: 231\u2013288; Graham 2015). The\ntext on which Burkert relied to conclude that the fixed stars have the\nfastest motion is, in fact, part of a speculative reconstruction of\nthe doctrine of the harmony of the spheres by a later Greek\ncommentator, Alexander of Aphrodisias, and not a description of\nPhilolaus\u2019 system. Nor need speculation\nabout the inhabitants of the moon indicate that the system is\nfantastical, since such staid Presocratic rationalists as Anaxagoras\nalso argued that the moon was inhabited (see D.L. II 8 and DK 59 A77).\nPerhaps the strongest reason for believing that Philolaus\u2019\nastronomical system was at least in part an attempt to explain the\nphenomena rather than just of religious and mythological significance\nis that other thinkers made objections to the system on empirical\ngrounds, and Philolaus responded to those criticisms in ways that\nattempted to show that his system could explain or \u201csave\u201d\nthe phenomena. Thus an obvious objection to the system is that we\nnever observe the central fire at the center of the universe.\nPhilolaus explained this by supposing that the earth rotates once on\nits axis as it orbits the central fire, so that our side of the earth\nis always turned away from the central fire and hence we never see it.\nThis is also why we never see the counter earth, which is evidently\nsupposed to move at the same speed as the earth. An objection to the\nmoving earth was raised on the grounds that the parallax produced by\nits movement from one side to the other of the central fire would\ncause the sun, moon and planets to appear to move in ways in which\nthey do not. Philolaus evidently argued that the diameter of the\nearth\u2019s orbit was so small relative to the distance to the other\nheavenly bodies that the parallax effects would be negligible (De\nCaelo 293b25\u201330). It is not clear that this solves the\nproblem, but if the system is solely of mythic or religious\nsignificance it is odd that other thinkers, including Aristotle,\ntreated the system as if it were supposed to be consistent with the\nphenomena, and even more surprising that Philolaus tried to defend the\nsystem by showing that it was consistent with those phenomena.\nMoreover, as mentioned above, Graham has recently shown that the\ncounter-earth is not introduced just for a priori reasons but\nserves to give the most sophisticated account of lunar eclipses of the\ntime (Graham 2015).\n\nComparison between the cosmology of the oral sayings ascribed to\nPythagoras (the acusmata) and Philolaus\u2019s cosmos shows that\nPhilolaus\u2019 system represents the transition from a cosmology that is\nprimarily mythical to one that is primarily rational and scientific\n(Huffman 2013a). It remains possible that, while the system is\nintended to save the phenomena, some of its features may retain\nreligious significance as well; some have argued that the\ncounter-earth might be connected to a realm common in folklore where\neverything is \u201ccounter\u201d to our world, a realm that often\nhas connections to the world of the dead, Hades (Burkert 1972a,\n347\u20138; Kingsley 1995, 186\u20137), but there are not good\nparallels for such a conception of Hades in the Greek tradition. Kingsley argues that the central fire is to be\nequated with Tartarus, a region even below Hades in Greek myth, and\nthat the introduction of the counter earth and central fire is largely\ninspired by interpretation of Homer\u2019s description of Hades and\nTartarus as below the earth; Aristotle attests that the Pythagorean\nname for the central fire was  Dios phylak\u00ea, which\nKingsley translates as \u201cprison of Zeus,\u201d which would\naccord with Tartarus\u2019 function as the prison in which the Titans as\nwell as humans damned to punishment were kept (1995, 183 ff.). The\ntext on which Kingsley relies (Anatolius, On the Decad 6.13\nHeiberg) does not mention Philolaus by name, however, and is not, in\nfact, likely to be referring to Philolaus.\nMoreover, Philolaus calls the central fire \u201cthe hearth,\u201d\nwhose positive connotations as the religious center of the house and\nstate are hard to reconcile with its being the place of punishment,\nTartarus. In addition, parallels show that, in the fifth and fourth\ncentury, the name  Dios phylak\u00ea refers to a garrison\nthat guards Zeus or his palace rather than to a prison (Plato,\nProtagoras 321d). In mythical terms it thus appears that\nPhilolaus conceived of the central fire as the fire that Zeus kept\nguarded in his palace and that Prometheus stole and gave to humanity.\nPhilolaus\u2019 cosmogony, in which the central fire draws in void and thus\nseparates off parts of fire and spreads them to the rest of the cosmos\nthus replicates Prometheus\u2019 theft in naturalistic terms. This\nconnection to myth is confirmed by Plato\u2019s description of Philolaus\u2019\nmetaphysical system as hurled down from the gods to men by some\nPrometheus (Philebus 16c), but it is hard to know what\nreligious significance Philolaus saw in the myth (see Huffman 2007 for a response to Kingsley\u2019s points). \n\nBetegh (2014: 162\u20136) has recently argued that while Philolaus\u2019 system\ndoes make sense as a contribution to the tradition of rational\nPresocratic cosmology it at the same time incorporates and\nreinterprets elements of the religious tradition concerning the\nhearth. Thus, the hearth was the center of the household and putting a\nhearth at the center of the cosmos suggested that it was analogous to\nthe household. The ritual by which the newborn child was carried\naround the hearth to introduce it into the household is now paralleled\nby the planets motion around the central fire. Moreover, Betegh argues\nthat the Orphic tradition represented by the Derveni papyrus shows a\nsimilar tendency to give a new religious relevance to concepts derived\nfrom natural philosophy. He also argues that there are striking\nsimilarities between the cosmological theories of the author of the\nDerveni papyrus and Philolaus, partcularly in the role of fire. At the\nsame time it is noteworthy that whereas the Derveni author presents a\ndemiurgic mind as ordering the cosmos, Philolaus never explains what\nbrought limiters and unlimiteds together to form the cosmos (on this\nlack of an efficient cause see also Graham 2014: 65\u20136). \n",
