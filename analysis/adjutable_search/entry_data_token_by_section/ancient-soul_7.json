    "main_text": "Hellenistic Theories of Soul || Epicurus' Theory of Soul\n5.1 Epicurus' Theory of Soul\n\n Epicurus is an atomist, and in accordance with his atomism he takes\nthe soul, like everything else that there is except for the void, to\nbe ultimately composed of atoms. Our sources are somewhat unclear as\nto exactly which kinds of materials he took to be involved in the\ncomposition of soul. It is very probable, though, that in addition to\nsome relatively familiar materials \u2014 such as fire-like and\nwind-like stuffs, or rather the atoms making up such stuffs \u2014\nthe soul, on Epicurus' view, also includes, in fact as a key\ningredient, atoms of a nameless kind of substance, which is\nresponsible for sense-perception. Thus it seems that while he thought\nhe could explain phenomena such as the heat or warmth of a living\norganism, as well as its movement and rest, by appealing to relatively\nfamiliar materials and their relatively familiar properties, he did\nfeel the need to introduce a mysterious additional kind of substance\nso as to be able to explain sense-perception, apparently on the\ngrounds that \u201csense-perception is found in none of the named\nelements\u201d (L&S 14C). It is worth noting that it is\nspecifically with regard to sense-perception that Epicurus thinks the\nintroduction of a further, nameless kind of substance is called for,\nrather than, for instance, with regard to intellectual cognition. What\nthis suggests, and what in fact we have independent reason to think,\nis that on Epicurus' view, once one is in a position adequately to\nexplain sense-perception, one will then also be in a position to work\nout an explanation of intellectual cognition, by appropriately\nextending the explanation of sense-perception. Let us consider briefly\nhow such extension might work. \n\n Perceptual beliefs, like the belief that \u2018there is a horse over\nthere\u2019, will be explained, in Epicurus' theory, in terms of\nsense-impressions and the application of concepts\n(\u2018preconceptions\u2019; for discussion cf.  Asmis 1999,\n276-83), and concept-formation is in turn explained in terms of\nsense-impression and memory. According to Diogenes Laertius' summary\n(L&S 17E1-2), the Epicureans say that \n\n preconception is, as it were, cognition or correct belief or\nconception or universal \u2018stored notion\u2019 (i.e. memory), of\nthat which has frequently become evident externally:\ne.g. \u2018such-and-such a kind of thing is a man\u2019. For as soon\nas the word \u2018man\u2019 is uttered, immediately its impression\nalso comes to mind by means of preconception, as a result of\nantecedent sense-perceptions. \n\n Moreover, sense-impressions, interpreted and articulated in terms of\nconcepts or preconceptions, yield experience concerning evident\nmatters, which in turn forms the basis for conclusions about\nnon-evident matters. For example, extensive experience can make clear\nto one not only that the human beings one has interacted with have a\ncertain feature (say, rationality), but also (later Epicureans will\nsay, probably somewhat developing Epicurus' position) that it is\ninconceivable that any human being could fail to have that feature\n(cf. L&S 18F4-5). And so, experience will not only make one\nexpect, with a very great deal of confidence, that any human being one\nwill ever encounter anywhere will be rational. Experience also,\naccording to the Epicureans, supports the inference to, and hence\njustifies one in accepting, the (non-evident) conclusion that all\nhuman beings, everywhere and at all times, are rational (for detailed\ndiscussion, cf. Allen 2001, 194-241). This obviously is an extremely\ngenerous view of what experience, and ultimately sense-perception, can\ndo! Once we recognize the enormously powerful and fundamental role\nEpicurus and his followers assign to sense-perception, we will not be\nsurprised to see that they feel the need to include in the composition\nof the soul a very special kind of material that accounts specifically\nfor sense-perception, but apparently do not think that, in addition to\nthat, some further special material is needed to enable intellectual\nor rational activity. \n\n In the Epicurean tradition the word \u2018soul\u2019 is sometimes\nused in the broad traditional way, as what animates living things\n(e.g., Diogenes of Oenoanda, fr. 37 Smith), but the focus of interest,\nso far as the soul is concerned, is very much on the mental functions\nof cognition, emotion and desire. A view that is common in the\ntradition and that very probably goes back to the founder is that the\nsoul is a composite of two parts, one rational, the other\nnonrational. The rational part, which Lucretius calls mind\n[animus], is the origin of emotion and impulse, and it is also\nwhere (no doubt among other operations) concepts are applied and\nbeliefs formed, and where evidence is assessed and inferences are\nmade. The nonrational part of the soul, which in Lucretius is somewhat\nconfusingly called soul [anima], is responsible for receiving\nsense-impressions, all of which are true according to Epicurus. Error\narises at a later stage, when sense-impressions are interpreted by the\nrational part of the soul, in a way that, as we have seen, crucially\ninvolves memory. Sense-perception, conceived of simply as the\nreception of sense-impressions by the nonrational soul, does not\ninvolve memory (cf. L&S 16B1). Since the formation and application\nof concepts requires memory, sense-perception, so conceived of, does\nnot involve conceptualization, either. The nonrational part is also\nresponsible for transmitting impulses originating from the rational\npart, as well as (presumably) for a wide variety of other vital\nfunctions. (When Epicurus distinguishes between pleasures and pains of\nthe soul and those of the body, incidentally, the distinction he has\nin mind must be between the rational part of the soul on the one hand\nand the body animated by nonrational soul, on the other.) \n",
