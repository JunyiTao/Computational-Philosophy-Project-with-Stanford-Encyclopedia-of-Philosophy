    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cEugenics\u201d is a term loaded with\nhistorical significance and a strong negative valence. Its literal\nmeaning \u2013 good birth \u2013 suggests a suitable goal for all\nprospective parents, yet its historical connotations tie it to\nappalling policies, including forced sterilizations, selective breeding\nprograms in North America and Asia, and horrifying concentration camps\nand mass exterminations in Nazi Germany. Undoubtedly, we have an\nobligation never to forget the Holocaust, or indeed, any of the\nhorrible policies and actions that have been justified in the name of\ncreating better people. Yet intuitively we have some moral obligation\nto promote good births \u2013 to have, in the most literal sense,\neugenic aims. Indeed, if parents are encouraged to provide the best\nenvironment for their children (good nutrition, education, health care,\na loving family situation, etc.), why not also encourage them to ensure\ntheir children have good genes? And if we\nhave some moral obligation to secure the well-being\nof our future children (a question explored extensively in the\nliterature on the non-identity problem; see the entry on\n the nonidentity problem), \n do these obligations entail the\nuse of reprogenetic technologies and practices?  This question is\nparticularly important given that current genomic science and\ntechnology permit significant control over reproductive choices. Can\nthese contemporary practices be distinguished, in their aims, forms,\njustifications, and likely consequences, from the clearly morally\nimpermissible eugenic programs of the past?\n\n\nSome philosophers think they can be distinguished,\nand they have explored the desirability of a \u201cliberal\u201d or\n\u201cnew\u201d as opposed to an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d or\n\u201cold\u201d eugenics (Agar 2004). Liberal eugenics would be based\nupon prospective parents\u2019 free choice, pluralist values, and\nup-to-date scientific understanding of genomic science and technology.\nFurthermore, advocates of liberal eugenics aim to be sensitive to the\neffects of some problematic but deeply entrenched social problems\n(e.g., racism, sexism, heterosexism) on individual choice.\nAuthoritarian eugenics programs, in contrast, were coercive state\nprograms designed to promote social goods, and were based on\nproblematic scientific assumptions about hereditability. Liberal\neugenicists point to significant developments in our understanding of\ngenomic science to help distinguish contemporary liberal eugenics from\nits problematic predecessors. Indeed, scientific advances of the last\nseveral decades \u2013 years that include the advent of in vitro\nfertilization (IVF), the funding and completion of the Human Genome\nProject, creation of the National Human Genome Research Institute\n(NHGRI), and expansions of pre-implantation screening, prenatal testing\npanels, as well as development of genome editing \u2013 provide not only\nmore precise understandings of genes and their role in shaping\nphenotypes and gene-environment interactions, but also a multitude of\npossibilities for intervention in the process of reproduction. How\nought we to use this new knowledge and capacities? This entry proceeds\nas follows. It first offers a short history of the eugenics movement.\nThe second section presents some of the main arguments that attempt to\ndefine and defend a new or liberal eugenics. The last section covers a\nvariety of critiques of those arguments.\n",
