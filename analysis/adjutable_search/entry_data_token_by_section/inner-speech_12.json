    "main_text": "Self-knowledge and Metacognition || Metacognitive Approaches\n5.1 Metacognitive Approaches\n\nOne approach sees inner speech as especially well suited to aid in\nmetacognition due to its linguistic structure, or its link to public\nlanguage more generally. According to Andy Clark (1998), the fact that\ninner speech occurs in a language\u2014where such language is seen as\nabstracting away from the particularities of perception\u2014allows\nit to play a special role in \u201csecond-order cognitive\ndynamics\u201d (see also Prinz 2011, 2012). This, he holds, is\nbecause the natural language sentences featured in inner speech are\n\u201ccontext resistant\u201d and \u201cmodality\ntranscending\u201d in ways that facilitate a more objective and\nreliable assessment of the soundness of one\u2019s own thought\nprocesses (Clark 1998: 178). Berm\u00fadez (2003, 2018) builds on\nClark\u2019s proposal, specifying that awareness of inner speech is\nessential for enabling humans to become conscious of their own\npropositional thought processes, which are otherwise amodal and\ninaccessible to introspection. According to Berm\u00fadez,\n\n\nall the propositional thoughts that we consciously introspect\n\u2026 take the form of sentences in a public language. (emphasis\noriginal, 2003: 159\u2013160)\n\n\nWhile he does not identify these public language sentences with our\ncore thought processes themselves\u2014these, he holds, occur in a\nsubconscious language of thought\u2014Berm\u00fadez argues that the\nlinguistic structure of inner speech is needed to adequately represent\nthe relationships of entailment and rational support that may (or may\nnot) exist among the subconscious thoughts the inner speech episodes\nserve to express. As he puts it,\n\n\nwe think about thoughts through thinking about the sentences through\nwhich those thoughts might be expressed. (2003: 164)\n\n\nJackendoff (1996, 2007, 2011, 2012) and Prinz (2011, 2012) likewise\nhold that there is a level of conceptual thought that is not directly\navailable to introspection and that inner speech is well suited for\nmaking us aware of such thoughts. Yet, for Jackendoff and Prinz, inner\nspeech is able to play this role primarily because, like other\nimagistic mental states, inner speech occurs at an\n\u201cintermediate\u201d level of representation, which, on their\ntheories, is the only level of representation at which mental states\nare consciously available to the subject. Thus Jackendoff\u2019s\ncomment that \u201cwe are aware of our thinking because we hear the\nassociated sounds in our heads\u201d (2011: 613). Echoing\nBerm\u00fadez and Clark, Prinz finds it\n\n\nlikely that we often come to know what we are thinking by hearing\ninner statements of the sentences that we would use to express our\nthoughts (2011:. 186)\n\n\nand judges inner speech to be \u201ca way of registering complex\nthoughts in consciousness\u201d (2011: 186).
