    "main_text": "\n\nThe English verb \u2018reduce\u2019, derives from the Latin\n\u2018reducere\u2019, whose literal meaning \u2018to bring\nback\u2019, informs its metaphorical use in philosophy. If one\nasserts that the mental reduces to the physical, that heat reduces to\nkinetic molecular energy, or that one theory reduces to another\ntheory, one implies that in some relevant sense the reduced theory can\nbe brought back to the reducing theory, the mental can be\nbrought back to the physical, or heat can be brought\nback to molecular kinetic energy. The term\n\u2018reduction\u2019 as used in philosophy expresses the idea that\nif an entity x reduces to an entity y then y is\nin a sense prior to x, is more basic than\nx, is such that x fully depends upon it or is\nconstituted by it. Saying that x reduces to y\ntypically implies that x is nothing more than y\nor nothing over and above y.\n\nThough the term \u2018reduction\u2019 in this use may not correspond\nto everyday use nor to scientific discourse, its technical meaning is\nnot fixed by mere stipulation. \u2018Reduction\u2019 is a term of\nnatural language, and, building upon its common metaphoric meaning\nphilosophers use it to designate relations of particular philosophical\nimportance in a number of closely related fields, especially in the\nphilosophy of science, the philosophy of mind, and metaphysics.\n\nThe notion of scientific reduction as used in contemporary\nanalytic philosophy differs from conceptions of reduction according to\nwhich we learn about the instantiation of reduction-relations on a\npurely a priori basis from basic religious, metaphysical or\nepistemological principles. \u2018Scientific reduction\u2019 applies\nto reductionist claims supposedly justified by scientific evidence and\nthe success of science.\n\nDifferent accounts of scientific reduction have shaped debates about\ndiverse topics including scientific unification, the relation between\n(folk-)psychology and neuroscience, the\nmetaphysics of the mind, the status of biology vis \u00e0\nvis chemistry, and the relation between allegedly teleological\nexplanations and causal explanations. Understanding the relevant\nnotions is thus a prerequisite for understanding key issues in\ncontemporary analytic philosophy. Moreover, the notion of reduction\nitself has become a target of recent philosophical discussion,\nespecially in the philosophy of science and in metaphysics.\n",
