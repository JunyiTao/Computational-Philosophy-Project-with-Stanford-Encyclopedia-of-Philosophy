    "main_text": "Beyond PAP || Compatibilism Re-energized?\n5.1 Compatibilism Re-energized?\n\n\u00a71.1\n noted that combining PAP with some universal block of\nalternatives\u2014such as causal determinism\u2014rules out moral\nresponsibility. Here is a sketch of this kind of argument:\n\nP1.\n If determinism is true, then Kurt could not have done otherwise\nthan steal John\u2019s lunch.\nP2. \n If Kurt could not have done otherwise than steal John\u2019s\nlunch, then Kurt was not morally responsible for doing so.\nC. \n Therefore, if determinism is true, then Kurt was not morally\nresponsible for stealing John\u2019s lunch.\n\n\nThe first premise is supported by the Consequence Argument (see entry\non\n arguments for incompatibilism \u00a75):\n Given determinism, Kurt\u2019s theft was a necessary consequence of\nthe distant past plus the laws of nature. Kurt has no power over\neither of these, so he couldn\u2019t avoid stealing John\u2019s\nlunch. The second premise is an instance of PAP. And the conclusion\ncan be generalized to apply to any action: if determinism is true, no\none is responsible for anything they do.\n\nCompatibilists about determinism and moral responsibility reject this\nconclusion, so they must reject at least one of the premises. One\ntraditional sort of compatibilist accepts PAP (and P2), and targets P1\nand with it the Consequence Argument. This entangles the compatibilist\nin questions about the ability to do otherwise\n (\u00a71.3\n and\n \u00a74.2.1).\n However, if PAP is false, the compatibilist can avoid these\ndifficulties and reject P2 as unsupported. Without PAP in the way,\ncompatibilism receives new energy (see entry on\n compatibilism \u00a74).\n\nBut this route to compatibilism isn\u2019t straightforward. Even\nwithout the help of PAP, determinism may still preclude responsibility\ndue to the way it blocks alternatives (Frankfurt 1969;\nBlumenfeld 1971; Fischer 1982; Speak 2007). In FSCs, what makes the\naction inevitable doesn\u2019t interfere with the agent\u2019s own\ndeliberative processes or actions: the \u201cintervention\u201d in\nthese examples is merely counterfactual. By contrast, if determinism\nis true, its intervention is actual. After all, determinism entails\nthat every detail of how we choose and act is fixed by factors in the\ndistant past. As one might put it: in a deterministic world, we act as\nwe do because determinism has put us on the single track,\nbecause we could not do otherwise. So even if FSCs show that the mere\nblocking of alternatives does not preclude moral responsibility,\ndeterminism\u2019s distinctive way of blocking alternatives is still\na threat. (In light of this point, one could reformulate the above\nincompatibilist argument explicitly in terms of the particular way\ndeterminism blocks alternatives. The modified P2 would not require\nPAP, though it would need a weaker principle.)\n\nThis move shifts the burden back to compatibilists, who need to\nexplain why determinism, in spite of the way it blocks alternatives,\ndoesn\u2019t undermine responsibility. A traditional compatibilist\nreply points out that determinism\u2014unlike compulsion and other\nthreats to responsibility\u2014does not disrupt the normal operation\nof our faculties; in that sense, its \u201cinvasiveness\u201d is\nbenign (cp.\n \u00a73.1).\n A more ambitious line defends this point by developing an\nindependently plausible compatibilist account of moral responsibility.\nHere, briefly, are two such attempts (see entry on\n compatibilism\n for a detailed treatment of these and other compatibilist\noptions).\n\nOne is from Frankfurt (1971) and others, who say the morally\nresponsible agent is one who identifies with the motives that cause\nhim to act. Consider volitional necessity\n (\u00a73.3):\n While Luther is compelled by his conscience, he identifies with these\nmoral motives. Similarly, even if the willing addict can\u2019t help\nbut take the drug, he endorses the addiction. Such cases appeared\nearlier as attempted counterexamples to PAP. Now they are treated as\ncases of benign necessitation, ways of blocking alternatives, that,\nwhile operating through an agent\u2019s own deliberative processes,\nare compatible with moral responsibility. As long as the agent\nendorses (or at least does not reject) these processes, they\nneedn\u2019t preclude responsibility. If an account along these lines\ncan be independently defended, a compatibilist can claim to have met\nthe above demand, as identification, and thus responsibility, is\ncompatible with determinism.\n\nAnother influential account is from Fischer and Ravizza (1998; see\nalso Fischer 1994). One lesson of FSCs is that the explanation of\nmoral responsibility should be found in the actual sequence leading up\nto an agent\u2019s choice and action. In the Black-Jones case, what\nhappens in the alternative sequence, in which Black intervenes, is not\nrelevant to Jones\u2019 responsibility. It\u2019s not even clear\nthat Jones does anything in the alternative sequence\n (\u00a74.2.2).\n His moral responsibility, then, must be grounded in what actually\nhappens when Jones chooses on his own to vote for the Republican.\nFischer and Ravizza argue that the relevant portion of the actual\nsequence includes a \u201creasons-responsive mechanism\u201d\nproducing Jones\u2019 choice. As Jones deliberates, his deliberative\nfaculties are sensitive to reasons to vote for the Democrat as well as\nreasons to vote for the Republican. As it turns out, the latter\noutweigh the former, but there is still a scenario in which the\nreasons to vote for the Democrat to outweigh those to vote for the\nRepublican, Jones\u2019 deliberative faculties are sensitive to this\nfact, and he votes accordingly. In this sense, his deliberative\nfaculties can respond to competing reasons. (This Democratic-friendly\nscenario needn\u2019t be accessible to Jones; we can thus preserve\nFrankfurt\u2019s constraints.) Supposing that, given the appropriate\nbackground conditions, reasons-responsiveness secures moral\nresponsibility, the compatibilist has met the earlier demand, for\nhaving a reasons-responsive mechanism looks compatible with\ndeterminism.\n\nFischer and Ravizza\u2019s account allows that control of a sort is\nrequired for moral responsibility. One kind of control over\none\u2019s choices and actions is a matter of having alternatives: in\nthis sense, the control condition is equivalent to the rejected PAP;\nFischer and Ravizza call this \u201cregulative control\u201d. But\nthere\u2019s another kind, \u201cguidance control,\u201d that\ndoesn\u2019t require that the agent has alternatives available, and\nit\u2019s this that the reasons-responsiveness account attempts to\ncapture. Jones guides his action in the relevant sense, and for this\nreason can be responsible for what he does, even if, due to Black and\nhis computer, Jones lacks regulative control.\n",
