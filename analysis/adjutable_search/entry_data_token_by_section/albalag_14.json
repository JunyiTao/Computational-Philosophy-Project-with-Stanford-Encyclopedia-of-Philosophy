    "main_text": "Political Thought\n10. Political Thought\n\nIn the context of medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy, political\nthought was largely concerned with investigating the connection\nbetween social good and human happiness, on the one hand, and\nphilosophy and religion on the other. In the last section of the\nMetaphysics of the Maq\u0101\u1e63id, al-Ghazali\nrecapitulates Avicenna\u2019s view of the relationship between social\nwelfare and religion. Proceeding from the Aristotelian dictum that\n\u201cman is political by nature\u201d (Aristotle  Politics\n1252b30\u20131253a1), al-Ghazali stresses that human beings cannot\ndispense with social interaction and cooperation for fulfilling their\nbasic needs and for the sake of attaining the highest good of man.\nThis, however, is not possible unless society is stable and justly\ngoverned. The realization of these conditions is tied to the existence\nof a lawgiver that enacts laws and promotes doctrines that are\nconducive to the social and spiritual well-being.\n\nRemarkably, Albalag starts the Tiqqun with the political\ntheme with which al-Ghazali concludes the Maq\u0101\u1e63id.\nThe preface to the Tiqqun offers a gloss on the political\nnature of human beings, emphasizing the essentiality of society to the\nindividual\u2019s well-being and human survival in general. But,\nagain, society can be conducive to well-being only under specific\ncircumstances. From the point of view of a Medievalist like Albalag,\npluralism stands as a major enemy to social stability. The more\ndiversified the society the less stable and more conflict-fraught it\nis. Pluralism may result in constant warring among people to such an\nextent as to threaten human existence. Thus comes the need for a\nlawgiver who promotes social harmony by unifying people in creed and\npraxis.\n\nAlbalag accommodates the Torah into this political theme, assigning it\na crucial role in establishing social and political order and\nmaintaining the divinely ordained perpetual existence of the human\nspecies. Nothing in this outlook deviates from the view of Medieval\nAristotelians regarding the socio-political benefit of Divine Law.\nMaimonides, for instances, deems the Torah a key factor in the\nestablishment and preservation of social well-being. Still Albalag\ndeparts from Maimonides, as well as prominent Muslim philosophers such\nas al-Farabi and Averroes, in that he confines the Torah to this\nspecific socio-political purpose. These philosophers define divine Law\nin terms of its goal: unlike man-made laws which care only for the\nwelfare of society, divine Law cares for both the welfare of society\nand welfare of the soul (Fraenkel 2012: 175; Z. Harvey 1980:\n199\u2013200). Maimonides particularly emphasizes that the\nTorah\u2019s goal does not exclusively focus on the practical domain\nand that it concerns itself with theoretical virtues. Even practical\nactions prescribed in the Torah are conducive to the fulfillment of\nthe commandment to \u201clove the Lord\u201d (Deuteronomy\n6:4\u20135), which in Maimonides\u2019 interpretation is an\ninjunction for the true worship of God: intellectual worship. The\nTorah, accordingly, calls upon people to seek knowledge of all\nexistents by virtue of which man attains intellectual perfection,\ntruly worshiping God (Eight Chapters: 78; cf. Guide\nIII:53).\n\nUnlike Maimonides, Albalag scarcely associates the Torah with any\nexplicit role in promoting theoretical virtues. Indeed, he\ndifferentiates between philosophy and the Torah in terms of their\nrespective final goals. While philosophy aims for the happiness of the\nselect few, the Torah aims for the happiness of the multitude, the\nformer type of happiness is intellectual whereas the latter is\nexclusively civic. In this connection, Albalag defines four basic\nprinciples of the Torah, which, as he states, are also foundational to\nphilosophy and religious systems. These principles are: \n\n reward and punishment, \n the survival of the soul after death, \n the existence of a deity that rewards and punishes, and \n the existence of a divine providence that watches over human\nbeings, each according to his deeds.\n\n\nAs many scholars noted, these four principles belong to the category\nof principles that are necessary for social well-being (Touati 1962:\n44\u201347; Schweid 2008: 320\u2013321; Guttmann 1945:\n90\u201391). Furthermore, Albalag explains that the Torah adopts a\nstrategy of concealment. Revealing or concealing doctrines is\ndetermined on the basis of their respective benefits to society and\nsocial well-being. All in all, the preface to the Tiqqun\nstresses the value of the Torah as a political treatise that is\nnecessary for the establishment of justice and social well-being.\n",
