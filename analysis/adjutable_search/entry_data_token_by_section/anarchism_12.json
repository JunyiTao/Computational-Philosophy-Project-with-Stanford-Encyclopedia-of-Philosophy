    "main_text": "Anarchism and Political Activity || Nonviolence, Violence, and Criminality\n3.1 Nonviolence, Violence, and Criminality\n\nOne significant philosophical and ethical problem for politically\nengaged anarchists is the question of how to avoid ongoing cycles of\npower and violence that are likely to erupt in the absence of\ncentralized political power. One suggestion, mentioned above, is that\nanarchists will often want to emphasize the unity of means and ends.\nThis idea shows why there is some substantial overlap and conjunction\nbetween anarchism and pacifism. Pacifist typically emphasize the unity\nof means and ends. But not all pacifists are anarchists. However, we\nmentioned above that there is a connection between anarchism and\nChristian pacifism, as found in Tolstoy, for example. Gandhi was\ninfluenced by Tolstoy and the anarchists. Although Gandhi is better\nknown as an anti-colonial activist, Marshall includes Gandhi among the\nanarchists (Marshall 2010: chapter 26). It is possible to reconstruct\nanti-colonial movements and arguments about self-determination and\nhome rule as a kind of anarchism (aimed at destroying colonial power\nand imperial states). Gandhi noted that there were many anarchists\nworking in India in his time. In saying this, Gandhi uses the term\nanarchism to characterize bomb-throwing advocates of violence. He\nsays: \u201cI myself am an anarchist, but of another type\u201d\n(Gandhi 1916 [1956: 134]). Gandhian anarchism, if there is such a\nthing, embraces nonviolence. In general nonviolent resistance as\ndeveloped in the Tolstoy-Gandhi-King tradition fits with an approach\nthat turns away from political power and views the state as a purveyor\nof war and an impediment to equality and human development.\n\nObjecting to this anarcho-pacifist approach are more militant\nactivists who advocate direct action that can include sabotage and\nother forms of political violence including terrorism. Emma Goldman\nexplains, for example, that anti-capitalist sabotage undermines the\nidea of private possession. While the legal system considers this to\nbe criminal, Goldman contends it is not. She explains,\n\n\nit is ethical in the best sense, since it helps society to get rid of\nits worst foe, the most detrimental factor of social life. Sabotage is\nmainly concerned with obstructing, by every possible method, the\nregular process of production, thereby demonstrating the determination\nof the workers to give according to what they receive, and no more.\n(Goldman 1913 [1998: 94])\n\n\nGoldman struggled with the question of violence through the course of\nher career. Early on she was a more vocal proponent of revolutionary\nviolence. She began to rethink this later. Nonetheless, like other\nanarchists of her generation, she attributed violence to the state,\nwhich she opposed. She writes:\n\n\nI believe that Anarchism is the only philosophy of peace, the only\ntheory of the social relationship that values human life above\neverything else. I know that some Anarchists have committed acts of\nviolence, but it is the terrible economic inequality and great\npolitical injustice that prompt such acts, not Anarchism. Every\ninstitution today rests on violence; our very atmosphere is saturated\nwith it. (Goldman 1913 [1998: 59])\n\n\nGoldman views anarchist violence as merely reactive. In response to\nstate violence, the anarchists often argued that they were merely\nusing violence in self-defense. Another defender of violence is\nMalatesta who wrote that the revolution against the violence of the\nruling class must be violent. He explained:\n\n\nI think that a regime which is born of violence and which continues to\nexist by violence cannot be overthrown except by a corresponding and\nproportionate violence. (Malatesta 1925 [2015: 48])\n\n\nLike Goldman, Malatesta warned against violence becoming an end in\nitself and giving way to brutality and ferocity for its own sake. He\nalso described anarchists as preachers of love and advocates of peace.\nHe said,\n\n\nwhat distinguishes the anarchists from all others is in fact their\nhorror of violence, their desire and intention to eliminate physical\nviolence from human relations. (Malatesta 1924 [2015: 46])\n\n\nBut despite this rejection of violence, Malatesta advocates violence\nas a necessary evil.\n\nAnarchist violence appears as the violence of an individual against\nthe state. It is easy to see why such violence would be characterized\nas terroristic and criminal. For an individual to declare war against\nthe state and take action to disrupt the state is criminal. And thus\nanarchists have also been interested in a critique of crime and\ncriminality\u2014arguing that it is the law and the legal system that\ncreates and produces crime and criminality. This critique was advanced\nby Kropotkin as early as the 1870s, when he called prisons\n\u201cschools for crime\u201d. Similar ideas are found in Foucault\nand in more recent criticisms of mass incarceration. Contemporary\nanarchists will argue that mass incarceration is an example of state\npower run amok.\n",
