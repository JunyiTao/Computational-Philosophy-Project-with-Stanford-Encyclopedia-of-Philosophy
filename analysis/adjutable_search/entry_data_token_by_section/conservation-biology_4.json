    "main_text": "What is Conservation Biology?\n2. What is Conservation Biology?\n\nWhether or not there is a single thing that conservation biology as a\ndiscipline purports to conserve, there are philosophical questions to\nbe raised regarding the discipline itself. Specifically, is it a\ncollection of theories or models or something else? To explore this\nquestion, we will consider central examples of conservation\nbiology\u2019s practice. We can then turn to how best to understand\nwhat conservation biology is. But first, it useful to consider what\ntheories and models are.\n\nTraditionally, philosophers of science have typically focused on\ntheories, which they assumed were sets of natural laws (Hempel 1966)\n(see entry on\n laws of nature).\n Examples of laws of nature include the following. Newton\u2019s\nuniversal law of gravitation is \\(F_{ab} = G(m_a m_b)/r^2\\) which\nstates that the gravitational force between two objects \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) is proportional to their masses and inversely proportional the\nsquare of their distance. Newton\u2019s second law of motion is\n\\(\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a}\\) where the vector sum of forces\n\\(\\mathbf{F}\\) equals mass \\(m\\) times acceleration vector\n\\(\\mathbf{a}\\). Finally, there is the Boyle-Charles ideal gas law\nwhich is \\(PV = nRT\\) which says that the pressure \\(P\\) and volume\n\\(V\\) of a gas is proportional to its temperature \\(T\\). Philosophers\nof science and metaphysicians debate what makes statements like those\nabove laws. The answers include generalizations concerning empirical\nregularities (Ayer 1956), relations between universals (Dretske 1977),\nthe best system that trades simplicity in primitives for explanatory\npower (Lewis 1983), encode various symmetries (Fraassen 1989), and so\non. One powerful worry with thinking that theories are sets of laws of\nnature is that if, at a minimum, laws are true universal\ngeneralizations, then there no such laws at least in the special\nsciences since those generalizations have exceptions (Beatty 1995;\nCartwright 1983). That is, they are false. As the result of this\nargument amongst others, philosophers of science have increasingly\nfocused on models (Giere 2010; Odenbaugh 2005; Weisberg 2012) (see\nentry on\n models in science).\n\nModels are a type of representation that involve abstractions and\nidealizations (Cartwright 1999; Chakravartty 2001; Weisberg 2012).\nAbstraction in a representation involves not including all of the\nproperties of the thing represented and idealization involves\ndistorting those features that are represented. That is, models delete\nand distort. Another important feature of models is that they\nindirectly represent the world. According to many philosophers of\nscience, models describe mathematical or abstract objects, and these\nobjects are more or less similar to particular objects in the world\n(Weisberg (2012), but see Hughes (1997; Odenbaugh 2014)). Theories as\nsets of laws represent the world directly because their propositional\ncontent is about natural systems. There are a number of different\ntypes of models used which include physical, scale, computational, and\nmathematical models.\n\nIn the biological sciences especially, one rarely hears talk of laws;\nrather, it is models that are discussed. We can begin by considering a\nsimple model used in conservation biology, a metapopulation model\n(Hanski & Gilpin 1997; Levins 1970). A metapopulation is a\npopulation of populations that are subdivided spatially, but are\ncausally connected through migration. Let \\(P\\) be the proportion of\npatches occupied by a species, \\(c\\) is the rate of patch\ncolonization, and \\(e\\) is the rate of patch extinction. Thus, the\ninstantaneous rate of change in the proportion of occupied patches is\nthe proportion of patches colonized minus those in which extinctions\noccur. Mathematically, we have, \n\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = cP(1 - P) - eP\n\\]\n\n\nWhen \\(dP/dt=0\\), the non-trivial equilibrium proportion is \\(P^{*}=\n(c-e)/c = 1 - e/c\\). Thus, if the equilibrium proportion is greater\nthan zero, then the rate of colonization must be greater than the rate\nof extinction; namely, \\(P^{*} > 0\\) just in case \\(c > e\\).\nGiven that this is a model, there are abstractions and idealizations\nincluding the assumptions that the local populations are identical in\ntheir chances of colonization and going extinct, rates of colonization\nand extinction are constants, and distance between patches does not\nmatter. Models can be characterized by three features\u2014their\nparameters, variables, and laws (Otto & Day 2007). Parameters\ndescribe properties that are constant in value, variables describe\nproperties that change, and laws simply describe relationships between\nparameters and variables. Thus, \\(P\\) is a variable, \\(c\\) and \\(e\\)\nare parameters, and the equation \\(dP/dt = cP(1- P) - eP\\) is law.\nNote that the term \u2018law\u2019 used by modelers is not\nnecessarily the same as that of a law of nature. For example, a\nmodeler might call the differential equation above a law even if it is\nnot true of any metapopulation.\n\nConservation biologists use models all the time in almost every facet\nof their work. So we now consider several case studies of conservation\nbiology.\n",
