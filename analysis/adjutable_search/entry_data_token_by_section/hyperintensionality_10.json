    "main_text": "General Approaches to Hyperintensionality || Extended Worlds Semantics\n4.3 Extended Worlds Semantics\n\nIf a theorist starts from a possible worlds framework, and comes under\npressure to recognize hyperintensional distinctions, one response is\nto add impossible worlds (Priest 1992; Zalta 1997; Kiourti 2010; Jago\n2015; Berto & Jago 2019) taken as ways things could not be, or\nworlds where some truth of logic, mathematics, or metaphysics fails.\nWe will be brief on this topic here, as one can consult the entry on\n impossible worlds\n for more details.\n\nIn impossible worlds semantics, different impossibilities can be\ndistinguished by being associated with different sets of worlds (only\nimpossible worlds), and different necessary truths can also be\ndistinguished by different sets of worlds (all possible worlds plus\nsome of the impossible worlds). Each distinct necessary truth will\ncorrespond to a distinct set containing all possible worlds and some\nimpossible worlds; and each distinct impossible proposition will\ncorrespond to a set of worlds that contains no possible worlds, but\nwhich may contain impossible worlds (Rantala 1982).\n\nKripke (1965) already introduced \u201cnon-normal worlds\u201d for\nthe semantics of modal systems such as C.I. Lewis\u2019 S2 and S3:\nsuch worlds were points where all formulas of the form \\(\\Diamond A\\)\nare true, and all those of the form \\(\\Box A\\) are false (intuitively:\neverything is possible, nothing is necessary). Cresswell (1970)\noffered a logic of belief in which beliefs were modelled with sets of\nboth possible and impossible worlds, so as to not treat every\nimpossible belief the same as every other, and to allow someone to\nbelieve some necessary truths without believing them all. (See also\nHintikka 1975). Since then, impossible worlds have been used to\ntheorize about many of the hyperintensional phenomena discussed in\nthis entry.\n\nA closely related way to extend possible worlds semantics is to\nintroduce incomplete and inconsistent partial specifications of how\nthings could be, and could not be. So-called situation\nsemantics (Barwise & Perry 1983) employs these more general\nobjects to handle hyperintensional constructions such as\nspecifications of beliefs or information contents, as well as\napplications to avoid paradoxes that can arise from employing possible\nworlds. A version of situation semantics known as \u201ctruthmaker\nsemantics\u201d has recently been defended as being superior to\nstandard world semantics (see Fine 2012, 2016, 2017; Hornischer 2020;\nMoltmann 2020, forthcoming).\n\nWith impossible worlds added to a theory, necessarily equivalent\nexpressions no longer have to have the same semantic values. Apart\nfrom their widespread use in the semantics for logical systems, work\nhas continued on using impossible worlds for giving theories of\npsychological attitude ascriptions and of claims about meaning: see\nJago (2014) for one recent treatment of a number of issues involving\nmental content and reasoning. Impossible worlds also help in theories\nof other kinds of representations: for use in theories of impossible\nfictions, see Priest (1997) and Badura and Berto (2019).\nEpistemologists are starting to find applications for impossible\nworlds in theories of knowledge: see, for example, Melchior\n(forthcoming). And logicians are using them to model non-omniscient\nhyperintensional agents by combining impossible worlds semantics with\ndynamic epistemic logic (Bjerring and Skipper (2019); Solaki, Berto,\n& Smets forthcoming).\n\nGiven the limitations of Lewis-Stalnaker theories of counterfactual\nconditionals when dealing with impossible antecedents (see\n \u00a71.1.2),\n it is natural to extend a theory of counterfactual conditionals with\nimpossible worlds: see Routley (1989), Mares (1997), Nolan (1997),\nBrogaard and Salerno (2013). Similar theories can be offered of\nindicative conditionals: see Nolan (2016b).\n\nImpossible worlds have also been employed to give theories of a range\nof hyperintensional phenomena in metaphysics. One early application\nwas in the theory of de re necessity, in offering a theory of\nhow it could be necessarily true that an artifact could be made of\nslightly different material, but not too different, without succumbing\nto Chisolm\u2019s paradox (Salmon 1984). Impossible worlds can be\nused to give a hyperintensional theory of properties as sets of\npossible and impossible instances (Nolan 2013: 8). They can be used to\noffer a theory of metaphysical explanation (Kment 2014), or in a\ntheory of essence (Brogaard & Salerno 2013: 646\u20138). They can\nplay a central role in a theory of omissions of impossibilities\n(Bernstein 2016).\n\nThe literature to date has only scratched the surface of potential\napplications of impossible words in metaphysical theorizing. A range\nof concerns about postulating impossible worlds are discussed in the\nentry on\n impossible worlds, section 6,\n Nolan (2013), and Berto and Jago (2019), as well as the concerns\ndiscussed in\n \u00a72\n and\n \u00a73\n above.\n",
