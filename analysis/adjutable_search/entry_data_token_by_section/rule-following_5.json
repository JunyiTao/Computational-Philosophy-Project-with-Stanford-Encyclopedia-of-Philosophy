    "main_text": "The Sceptical Solution || Error Theories\n3.1 Error Theories\n\nSuppose we adopt an error theory: the view that all atomic, positive\nstatements ascribing meaning, content, or the following of a rule, are\nfalse. While some error theories are eliminativist (e.g., Churchland\n1981 on propositional attitudes), the error theorist need not\nsubscribe to eliminativism. For instance, J.L. Mackie (1977) argues\nthat although moral judgements are uniformly false, eliminativism can\nbe avoided given that some moral judgements are such that their\nacceptance facilitates securing the benefits of social cooperation in\ncircumstances where \u201cthe limitation of men\u2019s\nsympathies\u201d (1977: 108) threaten their\n attainment.[5]\n On this view, even though our practice of making moral judgments\nresults in falsehoods, it meets a subsidiary norm (or norms) in terms\nof whose satisfaction its pragmatic utility can be\n secured.[6]\n Might an error theorist about meaning, content and rule-following\nattempt to avoid eliminativism by following a similar strategy?\n\nIt might seem that there is room for this approach. In the case of\nmeaning, the subsidiary norm might be something like the following:\none ought to assert \u201cJones means addition by\n\u2018+\u2019\u201d only when Jones\u2019s \n\n\nparticular responses to arithmetical queries agree with those of the\ncommunity in enough cases, especially the simple ones (and if his\n\u201cwrong\u201d answers are not often bizarrely wrong, as\nis \u20185\u2019 for \u2018\\(68 +\n57\\)\u2019, but seem to agree with ours in procedure,\neven when he makes a \u201ccomputational mistake\u201d). (Kripke\n1982: 92) \n\n\nThis norm would thus be cashed out in terms of agreement with\nrespect to inclinations \u201cto go on\u201d in certain ways, and\nthe utility of our complying with it would be that it enables us to\nmake helpful discriminations\u2014for example, when seeking to buy\nfive apples\u2014between grocers whose inclinations match ours and\ngrocers with \u201cbizarre\u201d quus-like\n inclinations.[7]\n\nWhile this strategy might seem to some to be promising in the moral\ncase, it faces special problems in the case of meaning, content and\nrules (Boghossian 1989, 1990; Miller 2015a). In order for the strategy\nto be able so much as to be pursued, there has to be such a\nthing as complying or failing to comply with a subsidiary\nnorm\u2014and so, a fortiori, such a thing as complying or\nfailing to comply with a norm as such. An error theorist about\nrule-following, however, denies precisely that there are\nfacts about norm-compliance and non-compliance. Having argued that all\nstatements about rule-compliance are false, the error theorist\napparently lacks the resources for telling a story about the pragmatic\nutility of our continuing to engage in the practice of making\njudgements about rule-following. The upshot seems to be that, if we\naccept that there are no facts about speakers in virtue of which\nexpressions have meaning, embracing an error theory will not prevent\nthe notion of meaning from \u201cvanishing into thin air\u201d.\n",
