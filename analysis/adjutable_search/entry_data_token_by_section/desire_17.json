    "main_text": "Controversies Surrounding Desire || Well-being and Desires\n3.6 Praiseworthiness and Desires\n\n\nWithin moral psychology, desire features prominently in a debate\nover the conditions for moral praiseworthiness and blameworthiness.\n\n\nAccording to a familiar Kantian doctrine, a person is only\npraiseworthy for doing the right thing if the person acts only from the\nmotive of duty, and not from an \u201cinclination\u201d (a desire) to\ndo the right thing (Kant 1964). Thus, if the right thing to do is to\nsupport microlending in Africa, and I do so, then I am praiseworthy\nonly if I have acted out of my intellectual grasp of the fact that\nsupporting microlending is my duty. If have acted out of a desire to\nfeel good about myself, or even a desire to be kind or to work for\njustice, then I am not praiseworthy for doing the right thing. The\nthesis has also been defended by contemporary Kantians (e.g., Herman\n1993, chapter 1).\n\n\nOpposing the familiar Kantian doctrine is work by Nomy Arpaly, who\nargues that praiseworthiness in fact requires acting on certain\ndesires\u2014namely, desires for what is in fact good (Arpaly 2002;\nsee also Arpaly and Schroeder 2014). In Arpaly's view, acting rightly\nfrom a sense of duty is compatible with acting rightly in a way that\nis not praiseworthy at all, if one's view of duty is sufficiently\nmistaken that one ends up doing the right thing only by\naccident. Thus, if the right thing to do is to support microlending in\nAfrica, and I do so, then I am praiseworthy according to Arpaly only\nif I have acted out of a desire to be kind (if that is the content of\nmorality) or a desire to do what is just (if that is the content of\nmorality).\n\n\nBetween the contrasting views of Kant and Arpaly are the views of a\nnumber of virtue ethicists, Aristotle (perhaps) among them, who hold\nthat a desire to do what is right and knowledge of the right are both\nrequired for an otherwise appropriate act to be praiseworthy (e.g.,\nAristotle 1999, Hursthouse 1999).\n",
