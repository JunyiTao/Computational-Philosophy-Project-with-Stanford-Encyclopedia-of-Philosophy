    "main_text": "Ethics, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion || Utopian Philosophy of Religion\n3.5 Utopian Philosophy of Religion\n\nPerhaps the most poignant formula characterizing Bloch\u2019s general\nattitude toward religion is \u201ctranscending without any heavenly\ntranscendence\u201d (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 1288])\u2014or\n\u201ctranscending into the this-worldly\u201d (Transzendieren\nins Diesseits, see Traub & Wieser 1975: 234). This\n\u201chorizontal\u201d transcending (Agar 2014) is predicated upon\nthe utopian anticipation, the premonition of the ideal state, of the\nfull adequacy of the subject and the object. God is thus expected as a\nfuture utopian human kingdom, while religion is a necessary bearer of\nemancipatory utopian drive.\n\nThe openness to the future is something associated with the messianic\nmoment of Bloch\u2019s philosophy. The coming of the radically new\nmust meet the humans who prepare it and practically work towards its\nrealization. The general sentiment visible in the prophetic style of\nBloch\u2019s first writings is that of a tense anticipation of a\nradical revolutionary upheaval and of \u201ccommunist-apostolic\nkingdom of Christ\u201d (1921 [GA 2: 53]) coming. In fact, in\nBloch\u2019s early thinking, shaped by the feelings of deep social\nand cultural crisis, eschatology is a binding force of the whole human\nhistory.\n\nSince the state as an hierarchical and violent institution, new forms\nof community, or \u201cfraternal inwardness\u201d (Bloch 1918\n[2000: 161]), are called for. The Spirit of Utopia ends with\nthe invocation of the utopian community (indeed, the\n\u201cinconstruable question\u201d is a question on\n\u201cus\u201d)\u2014the community, on which God\u2019s own\nrealization in history is dependent, while T\u00fcbingen\nIntroduction to Philosophy begins with the formula that stages\nthe becoming of community out of mere individual being and the feeling\nof subjective\n lack.[9]\n Note that Bloch was skeptical towards the aesthetization of the\npolitical and the synthesis of an ethical and aesthetic genius in a\nsingle political figure of violence and domination. The function of\nthe spiritual leaders, the agents of creativity, is not to impose\ntheir genius on others, but to open up an anticipatory space of\nredemption (die Sache selbst, GA 10: 209) and share with the\nutopian community the practices and possibilities of this\nincompleteness, a yet \u201chidden human face\u201d (GA 10: 210) of\nan individual.\n\nThe political media of utopia for Bloch were the anarchist religious\nmovements that tried to emancipate themselves from the authorities of\nthe state and the church, to revolutionize existing institutions, and\nto establish new forms of democratic solidarity. This refusal to take\nthe world as it is, the political energy of utopia, is opposed not\nonly to conformist tendencies in Catholicism, but also to Calvinism\nhelping establish \u201ccapitalism as religion\u201d (1921 [GA 2:\n123]) and to Luther\u2019s Protestantism that repressed any social\nengagement and, in the irrationalism and quietism of its pure passive\ninwardness, fetishized the given political order. The mystical hiatus\nbetween action and redemption, between human creatures and\ntranscendent grace, and the projection of all the real agency on God\nstifled the work of emancipation.\n\nIn Atheism in Christianity, Bloch (1968 [2009]) consistently\ndemonstrates the entanglement of the political dominance of the ruling\nclass and intellectual dominance of religious doctrines. He thus\nfollows Nietzsche in exposing the political dimension of theocracy.\nHowever, his key argument remains that all the religions contain an\nutopian heretic core\u2014something Bloch calls Exodus\u2014that\nreveals the true meaning of religion: the emancipatory drive to throw\ndown the political and intellectual hegemony of the ruling class.\nBloch\u2019s key insight is to demonstrate that this drive is\nessential for the philosophy that emphasizes anticipation of the\nfuture and hope and for that, a non-dogmatic religious myth is a\nlegitimate ally. The revolutionary figure of Jesus is treated in view\nof its human dimension: Christ is a prophet of this world,\n\u201cmessianic kingdom of God\u2014without God\u201d (Bloch\n1954\u201359 [1986a: 1200]). Just as the Marxist orthodoxy could not\nsee any potential in romanticism and avant-garde, and thus failed\npolitically, Enlightenment, with its sweeping critique of religion,\nwent too far and discarded its own emancipatory core with the bath\nwater. Bloch, inspired by Feuerbach, but also by the gnostic sentiment\nof his earlier work, focuses on the not-yet-revealed Judeo-Christian\nGod of Exodus as a liberating figure and on the heroes of the\nScripture (such as Job), who discover \u201cthe processual God\u201d\n(Bielik-Robson 2019).\n\n\nDespite his atheism, something he espoused from the very\n beginning,[10]\n Bloch stated explicitly the link between hope and religion (GA Erg.\nBd.: 347), and some theologians saw in his philosophy of hope a\ncommitment to liberated version of Christianity that would accept the\nGod as an immanent eschatological force (see especially Moltmann 1964\n[1967], who puts eschatology at the center of theological discourse\nand defines its major object in essentially Blochian terms: to capture\nthe future within the present) (see also Moylan 1997).\n",
