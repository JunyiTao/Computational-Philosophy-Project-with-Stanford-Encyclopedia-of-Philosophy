    "main_text": "Denying Contingency\n2. Denying Contingency\n\nPhilosophers have responded to this problem in several different ways.\nOne obvious way to respond is simply to claim that there are no future\ncontingent events, despite appearances to the contrary. Different\npeople have taken this approach for different reasons. Some are\nattracted to the idea that every event has a prior sufficient cause\n(see the entry on\n causal determinism).\n Others believe that the idea of free choice does not require anything\nlike real contingency or the possibility of doing or intending\notherwise (see the entries on\n compatibilism\n and\n free will).\n Still others believe that God\u2019s providential control over the\nworld is so thorough and detailed that nothing is left to chance, not\neven the apparently free choices of human beings (see Calvin 1536,\nCarson 1981, Feinberg 1986, Furlong 2019, and White 2019, along with\nthe entry on\n divine providence).\n So one possible response to the difficulty here is to give up one\nhalf of the problem by denying that there are any future contingent\nevents in the first place. To return to our example from the Christian\ntradition, when Jesus truly prophecies that Peter will deny him three\ntimes before the cock crows, there is no philosophical puzzle as long\nas we do not claim that Peter\u2019s denials are contingent\nevents.\n\nMany philosophers and theologians do not find this approach very\npromising, though, because they believe strongly in future contingent\nevents, especially human free choices. How else might one respond to\nthe problem posed by prophecies concerning future contingent\nevents?\n",
