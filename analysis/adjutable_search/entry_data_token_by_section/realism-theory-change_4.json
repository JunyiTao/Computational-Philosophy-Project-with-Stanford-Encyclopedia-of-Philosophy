    "main_text": "Scientific Realism and the Pessimistic Induction || The \u2018Disastrous Meta-Induction\u2019\n2.1 The \u2018Disastrous Meta-Induction\u2019\n\nCapitalizing on the work of Richard Boyd, the early Hilary Putnam took\nscientific realism to involve three theses:\n\nTheoretical terms refer to unobservable entities;\nTheories are (approximately) true; and\nThere is referential continuity in theory change.\n\n\nPutnam argued that the failure of the third thesis would lead to a\ndisastrous \u201cmeta-induction\u201d:\n\n\njust as no term used in the science of more than fifty (or\nwhatever) years ago referred, so it will turn out that no term\nused now (except maybe observation terms, if there are such)\nrefers (1978: 25) (emphasis in the original).\n\n\nAn answer to this \u2018disastrous\u2019 history-fed argument was\nthe development of a causal theory of reference, which allows for\nreferential continuity in theory-change. This theory was first\nsuggested by Saul Kripke (1972) as an alternative to the then dominant\ndescriptive theories of reference of proper names and was extended by\nPutnam (1973, 1975) to cover natural kind terms and theoretical terms.\nAccording to the causal theory, the reference of a theoretical term\nt is fixed during an introducing event in which an entity or\na physical magnitude is posited as the cause of various observable\nphenomena. The term t, then, refers to the posited entity.\nThough some kind of descriptions of the posited entity will be\nassociated with t, they do not play a role in reference\nfixing. The referent has been fixed existentially: it is the\nentity causally responsible for certain effects.\n\nThe causal theory of reference makes it possible that the same term\nfeaturing in different theories refers to the same worldly entity. If,\nfor instance, the referent of the term \u2018electricity\u2019 is\nfixed existentially, all different theories of electricity refer to,\nand dispute over, the same \u2018existentially given\u2019\nmagnitude, viz. electricity; better, the causal agent of\nsalient electrical effects. Hence, the causal theory makes available a\nway to compare past and present theories and to claim that the\nsuccessor theory is more truthlike than its predecessors since it says\ntruer things of the same entities. It turns out, however, that the\ncausal theory faces a number of conceptual problems, most notable of\nwhich is that it makes referential success inevitable insofar as the\nphenomena which lead to the introduction of a new theoretical term do\nhave a cause (see Psillos 1999: chapter 11 for a discussion).\nPhilosophers of science have tried to put forward a causal-descriptive\ntheory of reference which makes referential continuity possible whilst\nallowing room for causal descriptions in fixing the reference of a\ntheoretical\n term.[5]\n",
