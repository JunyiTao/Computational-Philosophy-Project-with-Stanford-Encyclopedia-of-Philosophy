    "main_text": "Lewisian metaphysics: an overview\n1. Lewisian metaphysics: an overview\n\nOn a traditional conception, metaphysics aims to answer, in a suitably\nabstract and fully general manner, two questions:\n\nWhat is there?\nWhat is it (that is, whatever it is that there is)\nlike?\n\n\nLewis fully endorses this conception: for him, metaphysicians are not\nin the business merely of analyzing our \u201cconceptual\nscheme\u201d (except insofar as doing so is an effective\nmethod for finding answers to metaphysical questions), nor\nneed they pay any heed to the perennial philosophical calls for the\nabolition of their subject. They are, rather, engaged in an\nunproblematically factual inquiry into the nature of reality\u2014one\nwhose recognizable epistemological pitfalls provide no grounds for\ndoubting its legitimacy:\n\nOnce the menu of well-worked-out theories is before us, philosophy is\na matter of opinion. Is that to say that there is no truth to be had?\nOr that the truth is of our own making, and different ones of us can\nmake it differently? Not at all! If you say flatly that there is no\ngod, and I say that there are countless gods but none of them are our\nworldmates, then it may be that neither of us is making any mistake of\nmethod. We may each be bringing our opinions to equilibrium in the\nmost careful possible way, taking account of all the arguments,\ndistinctions, and counterexamples. But one of us, at least, is making\na mistake of fact. Which one is wrong depends on what there is. (Lewis\n1983a, p. xi)\n\n\nWe can begin to get a handle on Lewis\u2019s audacious and\ncomprehensive answers to our two overarching questions by\ndistinguishing three components to his metaphysical program:\n\nFirst, he offers an account of what the fundamental ontological\nstructure of the world is. Is, and must\nbe\u2014although as we\u2019ll see, that qualification turns out to be\nin a certain sense trivial. This account of fundamental ontology of\ncourse presupposes that the word \u201cfundamental\u201d\nmeans something, and in particular manages to cleanly\ndistinguish a certain central core of one\u2019s ontological\ncommitments from the rest. Suppose these commitments take the form of\nviews about what entities (or \u201cparticulars\u201d) there are,\nand what properties and relations they stand in. Then we can\ndistinguish two questions. Are some entities more fundamental than\nothers\u2014with, perhaps, an elite group of entities being the most\nfundamental? Are some properties/relations more fundamental than\nothers\u2014again, with, perhaps, an elite group being the most\nfundamental? You might find a \u201cyes\u201d answer to both\nquestions attractive. (E.g., chairs exist, but they are not\nfundamental-level entities\u2014though perhaps quarks are. Likewise,\nsome chairs have the property of being made of oak; but this\nis not a fundamental-level property\u2014though perhaps the property\nof having such-and-such electric charge is.) As for Lewis\u2019s own\nviews, with respect to the second question they are fairly\nunambiguous: He is quite clear that a proper ontology must include not\njust particulars but also properties and relations (see especially\n1983b); he is equally clear that it is a perfectly objective and\ndeterminate matter which of these properties/relations are more\nfundamental (or, in his terminology, more \u201cnatural\u201d) than\nothers (ibid.); he is officially agnostic about whether some\nproperties/relations are most fundamental, or\nperfectly natural (1986f). His views on the first question\nare, to my eyes at least, more difficult to discern\u2014but for\nreasons that, in the final analysis, probably do not matter. See\nthe\n\nSupplement on\n Fundamental Entities\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, to a very great extent he takes it that the route to\na proper theory of fundamental ontology is by way of a priori\nphilosophical inquiry. (An important qualification will be noted\nshortly.)\n\nSecond, he offers an account of modality, his famous\n\u201crealism\u201d about possible worlds. Lewis, like many\nphilosophers, takes talk of possibility and necessity to be best\nexplicated as disguised quantification over possible worlds (and\npossible inhabitants thereof), and he was endlessly ingenious at\nshowing how to use the resources provided by a theory of\n\u201cpossibilia\u201d to produce analyses of a host of modal\nlocutions. But his realism about possible worlds consists in much more\nthan inclusion of such entities into his ontology; indeed, it would\nprobably be better to call Lewis a \u201creductionist\u201d about\nmodality\u2014reductionist in a way that distinguishes him from\nvirtually every other philosopher of modality. For a typical believer\nin possible worlds will, if asked to explain what they are, give an\naccount that uses modal notions at some crucial point.\nPerhaps she will say that possible worlds are maximal\nconsistent sets of sentences (in some appropriate language);\nor perhaps she will say that they are certain kinds of maximal\nproperties that reality as a whole could have instantiated.\nLewis says no such thing: he offers a characterization of possible\nworlds\u2014and thus of modality generally\u2014in explicitly\nnon-modal terms. This complete subordination of the modal to the\nnon-modal gives his philosophy of modality a quite radical character,\nand also sheds light on some of his seemingly independent views about\nthe modalities involved in such concepts as causation, law of nature,\nand chance. (For example, Lewis rejects philosophical accounts of laws\nof nature that rely on any primitive modal notions.)\n\nThird, Lewis offers an account of how facts about everything else\nreduce to the sorts of facts laid out in his accounts of\nfundamental ontology and modality. (Note that given the remarks in the\nlast paragraph, these reductions ultimately rest on facts about\nfundamental ontology alone; no unanalyzed modal notions are\ninvolved in them.) Better: he offers an assortment of distinctive\napproaches for constructing such reductions, of which there are many\nexamples but no single, canonical exposition. At this point I wish to\nmake just three observations about these strategies. First, they can\nbe seen to be directed at providing answers to a distinctively\nmetaphysical kind of question, of the form, \u201cWhat is it for\nsuch-and-such a fact to obtain?\u201d Examples will pin down the\nidea:\n\nQuestion: What is it for an object to persist through time?\nLewis\u2019s answer: It is for that object to be constituted by\nthree-dimensional, instantaneous time-slices that exist at different\ntimes. (Lewis 1988)\nQuestion: What is it for an object to have a certain property\nessentially? Lewis\u2019s answer: It is for every one of that\nobject\u2019s counterparts in other possible worlds to have that\nproperty. (Lewis 1968)\nQuestion: What is an event? Lewis\u2019s answer: It is a certain\nkind of property of spacetime regions. (Lewis 1986d)\nQuestion: What is it for one event to be a cause of another?\nLewis\u2019s (preliminary) answer: It is for the second event to\ncounterfactually depend on the first, in the sense that had the first\nnot occurred, the second would not\n have.[1]\n (Lewis 1973a, 1986b)\nQuestion: What is an explanation of some event? Lewis\u2019s\nanswer: It is a quantity of information about that event\u2019s causes.\n(Lewis 1986c)\n\n\nAnd so on. It is this kind of question\u2014albeit not always phrased\nin this way, and accompanied by definite views about what constitutes\na philosophically appropriate answer\u2014that animate what we might\ncall Lewis\u2019s \u201capplied metaphysics\u201d: the application of\nhis basic positions in ontology and modality to a range of perennial\nmetaphysical topics. Note that the reductionist character of\nhis approach comes out when we pursue the obvious follow-up questions:\nFor example, what is it for one event to counterfactually depend on\nanother? Roughly, it is for the closest possible world in which the\nsecond does not occur to be a world in which the first does not occur.\nWhat is it for one world to be closer to actuality than another?\nWe\u2019ll skip the answer for now\u2014but rest assured that it and\nthe answers to subsequent follow-up questions are designed to hang\ntogether in such a way as to collectively display how facts about what\ncauses what ultimately reduce to facts about fundamental ontology. And\nso it goes, for personal identity, free will, the mind, knowledge,\nethics, laws of nature, you name it.\n\nThe second observation is that it remains far from clear whether we\ncan dispense with the notion of \u201creduce to\u201d (or\n\u201cdetermined by\u201d, \u201cfixed by\u201d, etc.) in favor of\nsome philosophically more sanitized alternative; see the\n\nSupplement on\n Reduction\n\n\nThe third observation I wish to make at this point is that Lewis is\nstrongly motivated by a desire for theoretical economy\u2014both with\nrespect to ontology and with respect to ideology. His quest for\nontological economy shows up in the austerity of the kinds of\nfundamental entities he admits into his ontology (he neither shows,\nnor cares to show, any economy with respect to their number).\nHis quest for ideological economy shows up in several places, but\nperhaps most notably in his utter rejection of any unanalyzed\nmodal notions, and\u2014something that hasn\u2019t been mentioned\nyet\u2014in his attempted reduction of set theory to mereology and\nplural quantification.\n\nLet\u2019s take a somewhat closer look, now, at Lewis\u2019s account of\nfundamental ontology.\n",
