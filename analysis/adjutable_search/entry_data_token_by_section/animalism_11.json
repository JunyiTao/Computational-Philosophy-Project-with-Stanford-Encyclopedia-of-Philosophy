    "main_text": "Arguments for and Objections to Animalism || Animal Ancestors Argument\n3.4 Further Objections, Implications, and Questions\n\nThe rival candidates and thinking parts problems are instances of what\nwe might call \u201cmultiplication objections\u201d to animalism.\nThese objections try to demonstrate how advocates of animalism are\ncommitted to claiming (or incapable of denying) that one thing (you or\nme, say) is identical to each of two or more things. Yet another such\nobjection is inspired by a rare type of conjoined twinning called\ndicephalus, which occurs when a human zygote divides only partially\nbefore implanting in the uterine wall. The result is twins conjoined\nbelow the neck. These twins look like a two-headed person, with\ndistinct heads and necks sprouting from a single torso (Miller 1996).\nAccording to McMahan (2002: 35), because a pair of dicephalic twins is\ntwo people but only one animal, dicephalic twins appear to present a\nwalking, talking counterexample to animalism\u2019s hallmark claim,\n(1). (For further discussion, see Blatti 2007; T. Campbell and McMahan\n2016; Liao 2006; Olson 2014; Reid 2016.)\n\nOther objections aim to reveal animalism\u2019s counterintuitive\nverdicts concerning the seemingly endless litany of fantastical\nthought experiments (many of them updated versions of Locke\u2019s\nprince-cobbler case, see\n section 2.1)\n debated in the recent personal identity literature (S. Shoemaker\n1963; Lewis 1976; Wiggins 1980; Parfit 1984). In one scenario, we are\nto imagine removing all or part (e.g., cerebrum) of your brain and\ntransplanting it into a different (brain-less or cerebrum-less) human\nanimal, with the (ex hypothesi) result that your\npsychological life and characteristics are continued in a different\nanimal from the one you presently occupy. Another scenario envisions a\nsimilar feat via fanciful technology that can record all of your brain\nstates and transfer that information into a different animal\u2019s\nbrain (previously wiped clean). Still another thought experiment\nimagines transporting you \u00e0 la Star Trek by creating a\nblueprint of your physical and psychological states at one location,\ndestroying you, and then replicating you at some distant location by\ncreating a new object with all of the same physical and psychological\nstates.\n\nThe differences between the details of these thought experiments are\nnot insignificant. But for present purposes, let us collect them\ntogether under the label \u201ctransfer objections\u201d, since the\nintuition all of them aim to arouse is that you can be\nrelocated from one animal or location to another as a result of the\nprocesses described, so long as your memories, beliefs, desires,\ncharacter traits, etc. are preserved. If the transferability intuition\nis correct, then (1) cannot be true, since psychological continuity is\nnot sufficient for the persistence of a human animal. Indeed, for any\nof the procedures described in these cases\u2014brain-transplant,\nbrain-state transplant, teletransportation\u2014given the choice\nbetween undergoing this procedure and annihilation, animalism entails\nthat there is no self-interested reason to prefer the former.\n\nThe felt conviction of our prima facie beliefs about what\nwould happen in these scenarios seems undeniable. Moreover, there is\nevidence to suggest that intuitions supporting some version of the\npsychological criterion are not only firmly felt, but quite common\n(Nichols and Bruno 2010). So how do animalists respond? While many\nanimalists will concede the intuitions we have about these and other\ncases, they will also point out that we harbor many other\npre-philosophical commitments besides. We are, for instance, strongly\ninclined to believe that many animals (human and otherwise) are\ncapable of thinking (including remembering, believing, desiring,\netc.). Likewise, we believe that there is just one thinker located\nwhere each of us is. But if, say, the intuition in the\nbrain-transplant case is correct and you go with your brain when it\ngets transplanted into another body, then either the human animal left\nbehind was never capable of thinking (since the brain was thinking and\nthere was only one thinker in the vicinity) or there were multiple\nthinkers thinking your thoughts prior to the transplant (your animal\nand your brain). Surely these implications offend our\npre-philosophical beliefs about ourselves too. Consequently, if there\nare answers to be had to the fundamental nature and persistence\nquestions, then it is likely that those answers will reveal some of\nour pre-philosophical convictions to be correct, others not. (For\nfurther discussion, see Gendler 2002; Madden 2016b; Olson 1997;\nSnowdon 1991, 1995, 2014: chs. 10\u201311; and Wilkes 1988. And see\nSnowdon 2003 for a more thorough taxonomy of objections to\nanimalism.)\n\nFinally, beyond its contribution to the ancient debate over personal\nidentity, animalism raises practical questions of great contemporary\nsignificance. For example, animalists are committed to claiming that\neach of us was once or might someday become a non-person (e.g., a\nfetus in a mother\u2019s womb, a hospital patient in a persistent\nvegetative state). How are we to reconcile these implications of a\nmetaphysical view with our ethical commitments regarding abortion and\neuthanasia? More generally, if animalism is correct, then our\nfundamental nature is indistinguishable from that of blue whales, myna\nbirds, bonobo chimpanzees, and ring-tailed lemurs. How, in the light\nof this metaphysical view, are the ethical, legal, and policy debates\nthat assume a sharp human/animal (us/them) contrast to be\nrecalibrated? Such questions are only beginning to be explored (see,\ne.g., Johansson 2016; Sauchelli forthcoming, 2017a: ch. 5; D.\nShoemaker 2009, 2013, 2016).\n",
