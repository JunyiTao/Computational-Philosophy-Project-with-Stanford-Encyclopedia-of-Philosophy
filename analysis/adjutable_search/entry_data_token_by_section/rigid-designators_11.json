    "main_text": "Objections to Rigidity\n4. Objections to Rigidity\n\nVarious objections to the coherence or usefulness of rigidity have\nbeen put forward by specialists in the philosophy of language, though\nthe objections do not seem to have done much to damage the widespread\nappeal of rigidity, which is commonly taken for granted in mainstream\nliterature from various areas of philosophy. (Whether your typical\nphilosopher is entitled to embrace rigidity is another\nmatter: so there is a case for saying, on grounds independent from the\nforegoing objections, that rigidity and the necessity accompanying it\nstand or fall with a robust version of the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction (see \n note 4).\n If that case is solid, then either popular Quinean antagonism toward\nanalyticity should prompt the rejection of rigidity or else the appeal\nof rigidity should prompt the rejection of the familiar antagonism\ntoward analyticity.) What resistance to rigidity there is may be\naddressed in general terms first, in order to save for its own\nsubsection\n (\u00a74.2)\n treatment of objections specifically directed at the application of\nrigidity to terms for properties, which are especially contended.\n",
