    "main_text": "Justice: Mapping the Concept\n1. Justice: Mapping the Concept\n\n\u2018Justice\u2019 has sometimes been used in a way that makes it\nvirtually indistinguishable from rightness in general. Aristotle, for\nexample, distinguished between \u2018universal\u2019 justice that\ncorresponded to \u2018virtue as a whole\u2019 and\n\u2018particular\u2019 justice which had a narrower scope\n(Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, chs. 1\u20132). The\nwide sense may have been more evident in classical Greek than in\nmodern English. But Aristotle also noted that when justice was\nidentified with \u2018complete virtue\u2019, this was always\n\u2018in relation to another person\u2019. In other words, if\njustice is to be identified with morality as such, it must be morality\nin the sense of \u2018what we owe to each other\u2019 (see Scanlon\n1998). But it is anyway questionable whether justice should be\nunderstood so widely. At the level of individual ethics, justice is\noften contrasted with charity on the one hand, and mercy on the other,\nand these too are other-regarding virtues. At the level of public\npolicy, reasons of justice are distinct from, and often compete with,\nreasons of other kinds, for example economic efficiency or\nenvironmental value.\n\nAs this article will endeavour to show, justice takes on different\nmeanings in different practical contexts, and to understand it fully\nwe have to grapple with this diversity. But it is nevertheless worth\nasking whether we find a core concept that runs through all these\nvarious uses, or whether it is better regarded as a family resemblance\nidea according to which different combinations of features are\nexpected to appear on each occasion of use. The most plausible\ncandidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of\nJustinian, a codification of Roman Law from the sixth century AD,\nwhere justice is defined as \u2018the constant and perpetual will to\nrender to each his due\u2019. This is of course quite abstract until\nfurther specified, but it does throw light upon four important aspects\nof justice.\n",
