The Berlin School of Physics: 1878\u20131894\n\nBy the end of the 1870s, the experimental basis of electrodynamics had\nbeen established, but mathematics lagged behind. In memoirs of his\ntraining, Arnold Sommerfeld recalls that until the 1880s, the laws of\nelectromagnetic phenomena were constructed using unwieldy extensions\nof Coulomb\u2019s, Biot-Savart\u2019s, and Weber\u2019s\ngeneralizations of Newton\u2019s laws (Sommerfeld 1952, 1\u20132).\nFurther, although the relationship between electric and magnetic\nphenomena had been established, there was no direct empirical evidence\nfor the existence of electromagnetic waves.\n\nBetween 1870 and 1887, Helmholtz was Director of the Institute of\nPhysics at Berlin University. Between 1880 and 1933, the following\nscientists worked in Berlin: \u201cMax Planck [Helmholtz\u2019s\nstudent] and Albert Einstein above all, also Gustav Robert Kirchhoff,\nFriedrich Kohlrausch, Emil Warburg, Walther Nernst, Max von Laue,\nJames Franck, Gustav Hertz, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Peter Debye\u201d\nand others (Hoffmann 1998, 1).\n\nPerhaps the most significant relationship Helmholtz had with a student\nor colleague was with Heinrich Hertz. Beginning in 1878, Hertz did\nresearch as a graduate student in Helmholtz\u2019s and\nKirchhoff\u2019s laboratories. In 1879, Helmholtz set a prize problem\nfor the Prussian Academy of Science: \u201cTo establish\nexperimentally any relation between electromagnetic forces and the\ndielectric polarization of insulators\u201d (von Harnack 1900, 617,\ncited Hoffmann 1998, 6). While Hertz was very interested in the\nproblem, he put it aside in 1879 to pursue other work. In 1880, Hertz\ngraduated and took a position as Helmholtz\u2019s assistant. From\n1886 on in his own laboratory in Karlsruhe, Hertz performed his\nnow-famous experiments, which Hertz himself acknowledged were prompted\nby Helmholtz\u2019s prize question, demonstrating the existence of\nradio waves (which are a kind of electromagnetic wave). Hertz\n\u201cdiscussed his progress and results immediately and in great\ndetail with Helmholtz\u201d (Hoffmann 1998, 6).\n\nHertz\u2019s experiments and their consequences finally laid to rest\nthe disputes between Helmholtz and Wilhelm Weber. Among those\nconsequences was the death of Helmholtz\u2019s view that\nelectromagnetism is a kind of action at a distance, and the\nreplacement of the action at a distance view with a field theory,\n\u201cone of the major turning points in the history of\nphysics\u201d (Heidelberger 1998, 9). Since Hertz revealed empirical\nevidence for the existence of electromagnetic waves, \u201cthe\nsources of the electrodynamic effect are not anymore to be sought in\nagents that are hidden from our view but in the surrounding\nmedium\u201d (Heidelberger 1998, 17). While Helmholtz supported\nMaxwell\u2019s view that electromagnetism was a wave in the ether,\nHelmholtz explained wave propagation by means of action at a distance.\nHertz demonstrated that electromagnetic waves were perturbations in a\nmedium, which at the time was thought to be the ether, and which later\nwas re-conceived as a field. More importantly, Hertz explained the\npropagation of electromagnetic waves directly \u201cfrom the\ninteractions themselves,\u201d based on his empirical data, and thus\ndid not need to appeal to actions at a distance (Buchwald 1994,\n265ff).\n\nAlthough Hertz\u2019s results were in conflict with his own theory,\nHelmholtz supported Hertz\u2019s career with unflagging enthusiasm\nuntil Hertz\u2019s death at the age of 37. Recent scholarship by Jed\nBuchwald emphasizes the influence of Helmholtz\u2019s methods and\ntheory on Hertz\u2019s discoveries (Buchwald 1994).\n\nIn 1888 Helmholtz assumed the founding directorship of the\nPhysikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, an institute for the study of\nphysics and industrial technology in Berlin founded in part by\nHelmholtz\u2019s lifelong associate Werner von Siemens. For a\ncomprehensive history of the institute that illuminates the history of\nHelmholtz\u2019s later career, see Cahan 1989. Helmholtz retained the\npost until the end of his life.\n\nFor philosophical treatments of the shift from action at a distance to\nfield theory, and from Helmholtz to Hertz, see Heidelberger 1998 and\nLeroux 2001.
