When this is so, is it\nrational for us to continue to hold onto our beliefs with the same\ndegree of confidence as before? Or does rationality require us to\nreduce our confidence? This would appear to depend on our evidence\nregarding who is better-placed to reach a correct verdict on the\nmatter at hand. But consider the case in which, prior to the\ndisagreement, one has excellent evidence that one\u2019s interlocutor\nis an \u201cepistemic peer,\u201d someone who is roughly as likely\nas oneself to get it right on the matter at hand. What, if anything,\ndoes rationality require in this (\u201cpeer disagreement\u201d)\ncase?\n\n\u201cConciliationism\u201d is the view that in peer disagreement\n(some degree of) modification in one\u2019s confidence is rationally\nrequired. Two related considerations seem to support conciliationism:\nfailure to conciliate appears to be objectionably dogmatic, and the\ndisagreement itself seems to constitute some (higher-order) evidence\nthat one has erred. The most demanding version of Conciliationism is\nthe Equal Weight View, according to which one ought to assign equal\nweight to a peer\u2019s opinion as to one\u2019s own (Christensen\n2007, Elga 2007, Feldman 2006, 2007, and Matheson 2015).\n\nCritics of conciliationism offer a number of objections. One presents\na charge of self-refutation: since conciliationism itself is a\nwidely-disputed claim, it follows (given conciliation) that if\nconciliationism is true, we are not in a position to rationally\nbelieve it. (For further discussion, see Christensen 2013.) A second\ncriticism derives from the \u201cright reasons\u201d view of Kelly\n(2005). Suppose that after all evidence has been disclosed two peers\ncontinue to disagree over whether interests rates will rise. Since the\nfact of disagreement itself is not evidence bearing on whether\ninterest rates will rise, it is irrelevant to what one should believe\nregarding whether interest rates will rise. For this very reason,\nlearning of a peer disagreement should not affect one\u2019s\nconfidence on this topic at all. Rather, what rationality requires\nhere is what rationality requires everywhere: belief in accordance\nwith the relevant evidence. (Titelbaum (2015) offers a version of this\nargument restricted to the domain of beliefs regarding the norms of\nrationality themselves.)\n\nIn a more recent paper, Kelly has developed a third criticism of\nconciliationism, which calls into question whether rationality\nrequires the same thing in every peer disagreement. Developing what he\ncalls the \u201cTotal Evidence View,\u201d Kelly (2010) puts the\npoint this way:\n\n\n[If] you and I have arrived at our opinions in response to a\nsubstantial body of evidence, and your opinion is a reasonable\nresponse to the evidence while mine is not, then you are not required\nto give equal weight to my opinion and to your own. Indeed, one might\nwonder whether you are required to give any weight to my\nopinion in such circumstances. (2010: 135)\n\n\nLackey (2010) develops a similar \u201cjustificationist\u201d\nposition about peer disagreement. According to her view, what\nrationality requires in a case of peer disagreement is determined by\nwhat one\u2019s total evidence supports after one adds the\nevidence one acquires in the disagreement itself. In some cases, she\nargues, one\u2019s (post-disagreement) total evidence will require a\nsignificant change in one\u2019s degree of confidence, in other cases\nit will require no change at all, and in still other cases it will\nrequire something in between. As we will see, these positions are\nroughly consistent with more formal, Bayesian approaches to updating\nbeliefs on the credences of others.\n\nDebates over peer disagreement have branched out in interesting ways.\nOne branch concerns the epistemic significance of disagreement that is\n(not actual but) reasonably anticipated. (See Ballantyne (2015) for an\nargument for skeptical results.) A second branch concerns the\nepistemic significance of what Fogelin (1985) called\n\u201cdeep\u201d disagreements, long-standing controversies in which\nthere is no consensus about how to resolve the disagreement. While\ndeep disagreement has long been the basis for skeptical worries about\nthe possibility of ethical or religious knowledge, social\nepistemologists have turned their eyes more recently towards\nphilosophy itself (Frances 2010, Goldberg 2013, Kornblith 2013) and\nbeyond (Frances 2005).\n",
