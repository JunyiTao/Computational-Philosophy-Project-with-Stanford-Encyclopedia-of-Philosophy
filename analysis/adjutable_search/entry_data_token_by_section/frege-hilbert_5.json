    "main_text": "Lingering Issues\n6. Conclusion\n\nBecause claims of consistency and of independence are fundamentally\nclaims of non-entailment or of unprovability, it is\nnot obvious, even once we are in possession of strong techniques for\nproving mathematical results, how one might go about proving\nconsistency and independence. What Hilbert offers us, in 1899, is a\nsystematic and powerful technique that can be used across all\nformalized disciplines to do just this: to prove consistency and\nindependence. In doing so, he lays the groundwork, in concert with\nvarious of his contemporaries, for the emergence of contemporary\nmodel-theoretic techniques. (For further discussion, see Mancosu,\nZach, & Badesa 2009; also see entry on\n nineteenth-century geometry.)\n \n\nWhat we find through Frege\u2019s rejection and Hilbert\u2019s\ndefense of that technique is a clarification of the assumptions that\nare essential for its success. As we have seen, the crucial feature of\nproof that must be assumed, in order for a Hilbert-style\nreinterpretation to demonstrate an unprovability result, is\nthat provability is insensitive to the contents of those terms that\nHilbert takes to be reinterpretable\u2014in this case, the geometric\nterms. The alternative view of consistency and independence, on which\nentailment and provability are sensitive to the contents of geometric\nterms, is one with respect to which Hilbert-style reinterpretations\ncannot demonstrate consistency and independence so understood. As\noutlined above, the reading of Frege on which he holds such a view of\nconsistency and independence provides a rationale for his objections\nto Hilbert, and an alternative account of what is at stake in claims\nof geometric consistency and independence. \n\nDespite the clear failure of communication between Hilbert and Frege,\ntheir debate brings to light a number of important issues, not least\nof which are (i) the role of schematically-understood sentences in\nproviding implicit definitions, which Frege articulates more clearly\non Hilbert\u2019s behalf than Hilbert had yet done, and (ii) the\nextent to which the logical relations are to be treated as\n\u201cformal\u201d. On this last issue, the difference between Frege\nand Hilbert is instructive. Long before the debate with Hilbert, Frege\nalready held that logical rigor requires the use of formal systems of\ndeduction, \u201cformal\u201d in the sense that all thoughts are\nexpressed via precisely-determined sentences, and that all\ninference-rules and axioms are presented syntactically (see, e.g.,\nFrege 1879). Most important for our purposes is the fact that\nFrege\u2019s formal systems are entirely modern in the sense that the\nderivability in such a system of a sentence from a set of sentences\nturns just on the syntactic form of those sentences. The famous\nconceptual analyses on which much of Frege\u2019s work turns are all\nprovided prior to proof; it is on the basis of conceptual analyses\nthat one arrives at the appropriate sentences to treat within the\nformal system, but the analyses themselves play no role within the\nproofs proper. Hence when it comes to the positive work of\ndemonstrating that a given sentence is derivable from a set of\nsentences, Frege is just like Hilbert: meanings don\u2019t matter.\nIndeed, at the time of their correspondence, Frege\u2019s work was\nconsiderably more \u201cformal\u201d than Hilbert\u2019s, since\nHilbert at this time was not using an explicit syntactically-defined\nsystem of deduction.\n\nNevertheless, Frege\u2019s conception of logic has the result that\nthere is only a one-way connection between logical implication as this\nholds between thoughts and formal derivability as this holds between\nsentences. Given a good formal system, a sentence \u03c3 is deducible\nfrom a set \u03a3 only if the thought expressed by \u03c3 is in fact\nlogically entailed by the thoughts expressed by the members of\n\u03a3. (This simply requires that one\u2019s axioms and rules of\ninference are well-chosen.) But the converse is false: that \u03c3 is\nnot deducible in such a system from \u03a3 is no guarantee\nthat the thought expressed by \u03c3 is independent of the set of\nthoughts expressed by the members of \u03a3. For it may well be, as\nin the cases treated explicitly by Frege\u2019s own analyses, that\nfurther analysis of the thoughts and their components will yield a\nmore-complex structure. When this happens, the analysis may return\nyet-more complex (sets of) sentences \u03c3\u2032 and \u03a3\u2032\nsuch that \u03c3\u2032 is, after all, deducible from \u03a3\u2032.\nAccording to the more-charitable of the two interpretive options\noutlined above, this is the explanation of Frege\u2019s rejection of\nHilbert\u2019s treatment of consistency and independence in geometry.\nAs we might put it, because considerable logical complexity can lie\nundiscovered in the thoughts expressed by relatively-simple sentences,\nnon-derivability is no guarantee of independence, in the Fregean\nscheme of things. There is a significant gap, as one might put it,\nbetween the logical and the formal.\n\nFor Hilbert on the other hand, at least in the context of axiomatized\ngeometry, the logical relations simply are the formally-describable\nrelations, since they have entirely to do with the structure exhibited\nby the sentences in question, or equivalently with the\n\u201cscaffolding\u201d of concepts defined by these sentences. It\nis because consistency in Hilbert\u2019s sense turns just on this\nabstract structure, and not on the contents of the terms instantiating\nthe structure, that the reinterpretation strategy is effective.\n\nHilbert is clearly the winner in this debate, in the sense that\nroughly his conception of consistency is what one means today by\n\u201cconsistency\u201d in the context of formal theories, and a\nnear relative of his methodology for consistency-proofs is now\nstandard. We now routinely take consistency and independence, as\nHilbert does, to hold independently of the meanings of the so-called\n\u201cnon-logical\u201d terms, and hence to be straightforwardly\ndemonstrable in essentially Hilbert\u2019s way. This is not to say\nthat Frege\u2019s objections have been met, but rather that they have\nessentially been sidestepped via the enshrinement of the formal notion\nof consistency, and a lack of concern, at least under that title, with\nwhat Frege called \u201cconsistency\u201d. \n",
