    "main_text": "What is Digital Art? || The Digital Art World\n1.1 The Digital Art World\n\nIn its broadest extant sense, \u201cdigital art\u201d refers to art\nthat relies on computer-based digital encoding, or on the electronic\nstorage and processing of information in different formats\u2014text,\nnumbers, images, sounds\u2014in a common binary code. The ways in\nwhich art-making can incorporate computer-based digital encoding are\nextremely diverse. A digital photograph may be the product of a\nmanipulated sample of visual information captured with a digital\ncamera from a \u201clive\u201d scene or captured with a scanner from\na traditional celluloid photograph. Music can be recorded and then\nmanipulated digitally or created digitally with specialized computer\nsoftware. And a film is now the product of an extremely complex\nsequence of choices between analog and digital processes at the stages\nof image and sound capture or composition, image and sound editing,\ncolor correction or sound mastering, special effects production, and\ndisplay or projection.\n\nThe complexity of the digital cinema workflow draws attention to a\nfurther difference concerning whether reliance on the digital is\nrestricted to the way an artwork is made or extends to the display of\nthe work. A work may be made on a computer\u2014say, a musical work\ncomposed with Sibelius or a play written in Microsoft Word\u2014and\nyet meant for apprehension in a non-digital format\u2014say,\nperformance on traditional musical instruments or enactment on stage.\nSimilarly, a film could be captured and edited digitally before being\nprinted on traditional 35mm photochemical film for projection in\ntheaters. By contrast, works that are purely digital include a film\nmade and projected digitally\u2014for example, Dune (2021),\na piece of music composed and played back electronically\u2014for\nexample, the electroacoustic works of Gottfried Michael Koenig (see\n Other Internet Resources),\n and a work of ASCII art\u2014an image made up from the 95 printable\ncharacters defined by the ASCII standard of 1963 and displayed on a\ncomputer monitor.\n\nAn example of ASCII art:\n\n\n  (\\_/)\n (='.'=)\n (\u201c)^(\u201d) \n\n\n\nMore recent kinds of purely digital art include Instagram art and\nChatbot fiction. An example of the former is Land of Arca\n(2023), which is made up of narrative images created by AI and then\ncurated by the Instagram account\u2019s owner, IRK. An example of the\nlatter is any of the myriad science fiction short stories with which\nseveral literary magazines were recently deluged.\n\nEach of the examples above incorporates a computational process, to\nsome degree, in the presentation of the work. In many ways, works\nbelonging to digital media stand in stark contrast to those made by\ncompletely analog means.\n",
