    "main_text": "Four-self, No-self, and Indeterminate Self Theories || Temporal Parts Monotheism\n3.2 Temporal Parts Monotheism\n\nH. E. Baber (2002) argues that a Trinity theory may posit the\nPersons\u00a0as \u201csuccessive, non-overlapping temporal parts of\none God\u201d (11). This one God is neither simple nor timeless, but\nis a temporally extended self with shorter-lived temporally extended\nselves as his parts. This does not violate the requirement of\nmonotheism, because we should count gods by \u201ctensed\nidentity\u201d, which is \u201cnot identity but rather the relation\nthat obtains between individuals at a time, t, when they\nshare a stage [i.e. a temporal part] at t\u201d (5). At any\ngiven time, only one self bears this relation of temporal-stage\nsharing with God.\n\nHow can any of these selves be divine given that they are neither\ntimeless nor everlasting? Following Parfit, she argues that a self may\nlast through time without being identical to any later self at the\nlater times; that is, \u201cidentity is not what matters for\nsurvival\u201d (6).\u00a0Each of these non-eternal selves, then,\ncounts as the continuation of the previous one, and is everlasting in\nthe sense that it is a temporal part of an everlasting whole, God. The\nobscure traditional generation and procession relations are\nre-interpreted as non-causal relations between God and two of his\ntemporal parts, the Son and Spirit (13\u20134). In a later paper, she\nargues that any trinitarian may and should accept this\nre-interpretation (Baber 2008).\n\nAlthough Baber argues that this\u00a0is a \u201cminimally\ndecent\u201d Trinity theory, she admits that it is heretical, and\nnames it a \u201cNeo-Sabellian\u201d theory, because on it, the\nPersons of the Trinity are non-overlapping, temporary modes of the one\nGod (15; on Sabellianism see section\n 1.3).\n But the Persons\u00a0in this theory are not mere modes; they are\ntruly substances and selves, and there are (at least) three of them,\nthough each is counted as the continuation of the one(s) preceding\nhim. It is unclear whether the theory posits only three\nselves (10\u20131). But she argues that the theory is preferable to\nmany of its rivals \u201csince it does not commit us to relative\nidentity or require any ad hoc philosophical\ncommitments\u201d (15), and even though its divine selves don\u2019t\noverlap, sense can be made of, e.g. Jesus\u2019s interaction with his\nFather (meaning not the prior divine Person, but God, the temporal\nwhole of whom Jesus is a temporal part) (11\u20134).\n\nThis theory is notable in being a case not of rational reconstruction,\nbut of doctrinal revision (Tuggy 2011a). Many of its features are\ncontroversial, such as its unorthodoxy, its metaphysical commitments\nto temporal parts and the lasting of selves without diachronic\nidentity, its denials of divine simplicity and divine timelessness,\nand its redefinitions of \u201cmonotheism\u201d,\n\u201cgeneration\u201d, and \u201cprocession\u201d.\n\nIn a later discussion Baber argues that some form or other of\nSabellianism about the Trinity is theoretically straightforward and\nfits well with popular Christian piety. Further, such theories can\nsurvive the common objections that they imply that God is only\ncontingently trinitarian, and that they characterize God only in\nrelation to the cosmos. While some Sabellian theories do have those\nimplications, Baber argues that a trinitarian may just accept them\n(2019, 134\u20138).\n\nAlternately, Baber (2019) develops a structuralist approach to the\nTrinity which doesn't imply anything about how many selves it\ninvolves.\n",
