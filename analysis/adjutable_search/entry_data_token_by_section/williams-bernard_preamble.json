    "main_text": "\n\nBernard Williams (1929\u20132003) was a leading influence in\nphilosophical ethics in the latter half of the twentieth century. He\nrejected the codification of ethics into moral theories that views\nsuch as Kantianism and (above all) utilitarianism see as essential to\nphilosophical thinking about ethics, arguing that our ethical life is\ntoo untidy to be captured by any systematic moral theory. He was also\nan important contributor to debates on moral psychology, personal\nidentity, equality, morality and the emotions, and the interpretation\nof philosophers including Wittgenstein, Nietzsche, Descartes,\nAristotle, and Plato.\n\nWilliams\u2019 contributions were grounded in two overriding\ncommitments. First, he was deeply impressed by the importance of\nsubjective integrity or authenticity, and much of his work is\nessentially a sustained attempt to make sense of how moral theorizing\ncan avoid alienating individuals from their deepest values, cares and\nlife-projects. Second, this sustained attempt was made under the\numbrella of a variety of philosophical naturalism which was both\nanti-Platonic and anti-reductionist. He expressed these twin\ncommitments late in his life when he dreamed, wistfully, of \u201ca\nphilosophy that would be thoroughly truthful and honestly\nhelpful\u201d (2005: 212).\n\nIn what follows, we trace Williams\u2019 personal and philosophical\ndevelopment, beginning with a biographical summary and proceeding to a\ndiscussion of his most important ideas.\n",
