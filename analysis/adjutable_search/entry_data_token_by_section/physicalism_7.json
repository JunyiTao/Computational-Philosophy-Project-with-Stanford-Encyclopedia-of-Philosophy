    "main_text": "The Completeness Question || Grounding Physicalism\n2.4 Grounding Physicalism\n\nAn influential recent approach to the completeness question that is\ndifferent from any we have considered so far focuses on the idea of\ngrounding, something that has been extensively discussed recently in\nthe metaphysics literature (see, e.g., Fine 2001, Schaffer 2009, Rosen\n2010, Wilson 2014, Bennett 2017 and the essays in Correia and\nSchneider 2012). Intuitively, a property F is grounded in a\nproperty G just in case F holds in virtue of\nG, or the instantiation of G explains the\ninstantiation of F. This suggests: \n\n(7)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff every\nproperty instantiated at w is either a physical property or\nis grounded in a physical property.\n\n\nSuppose we call physicalism so defined grounding physicalism;\nwhat is the relation between it and supervenience physicalism?\nSupervenience physicalism does not entail grounding physicalism, since\nthe fact that a property F supervenes on a property\nG does not entail that F is grounded by G.\n\n\nDoes grounding physicalism entail supervenience physicalism? Some\nphilosophers suppose it does (e.g. Rosen 2010) and so for them\ngrounding physicalism would entail supervenience physicalism. But\nothers suppose it does not (e.g. Schaffer 2009) which raises the\nquestion of whether a thesis such as (7) by itself provides an account\nof physicalism, or whether some compromise between it and (1) would\nhave to be reached.\n\nEven if grounding physicalism entails supervenience physicalism, there\nare further issues about it that have been raised. One problem\nconcerns abstract objects, i.e., entities apparently not located in\nspace and time, such as numbers, properties and relations, or\npropositions. However, since this problem seems a general problem for\nall kinds of physicalism, we will discuss it below.\n\nA second problem for grounding physicalism is that the notion of\ngrounding is itself controversial in some quarters. Wilson (2014), for\nexample, points out that grounding per se is similar to supervenience\nin that it leaves open many of the questions philosophers of mind are\ninterested in, viz., whether the mental exists, whether it is reduced\nto the physical, and whether it is causally efficacious. She concludes\nthat grounding \u201ccannot do the work\u201d that its proponents\nwant it to do (2014, 542). One might respond that this depends on what\nwork grounding physicalism is supposed to do; indeed, it may be a\nfeature rather than a bug that grounding leaves these things open. But\nwhatever is the truth about this, there is no doubt that the precise\ncontours of the grounding relation are yet to be made out. Hence, the\nproper assessment of grounding physicalism is at this point a bit\nunclear (for some further discussion, see, e.g., Berker 2018 and\nSchaffer 2016). \n",
