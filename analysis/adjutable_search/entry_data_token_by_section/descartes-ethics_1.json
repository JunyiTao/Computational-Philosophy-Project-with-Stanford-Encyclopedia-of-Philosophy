The Provisional Moral Code of the Discourse\n\nThe best-known expression of Descartes\u2019 ethical views is the\n\u201cprovisional moral code\u201d (une morale par\nprovision) that appears in Part Three of Discourse on the\nMethod. Some have read this as a reliable statement of\nDescartes\u2019 considered position, but this is consistent neither\nwith the content of the Discourse itself nor with that of his\nlater writings. (For detailed discussions of the \u201cprovisional\nmorality,\u201d see Carraud 1997; Cimakasky and Polansky 2012;\nMarshall 1998, 2003.)\n\nDescartes frames the rules of his provisional morality as part of the\nepistemological project\u2014the search for certainty\u2014announced\nin Part Two of the Discourse. In order that he may act\ndecisively and live as happily as possible while avoiding\n\u201cprecipitate conclusions and assumptions,\u201d Descartes\nproposes \u201ca provisional moral code consisting of just three or\nfour maxims\u201d:\n\nThe first was to obey the laws and customs of my country, holding\nconstantly to the religion in which by God\u2019s grace I had been\ninstructed from my childhood\u2026. The second maxim was to be as\nfirm and decisive in my actions as I could, and to follow even the\nmost doubtful opinions, once I had adopted them, with no less\nconstancy than if they had been quite certain\u2026. My third maxim\nwas to try always to master myself rather than fortune, and to change\nmy desires rather than the order of the world\u2026. Finally, to\nconclude this moral code\u2026 I thought I could do no better than\nto continue with the [occupation] I was engaged in, and to devote my\nwhole life to cultivating my reason and advancing as far as I could in\nthe knowledge of the truth, following the method I had prescribed for\nmyself (AT VI 22\u20137/CSM I 122\u20134).\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 apparent uncertainty about the number of rules in his\nprovisional code (\u201cthree or four\u201d) is noteworthy and may\nbe explained by the different status he assigns to the rules. While\nthe first three prescribe how to act in the absence of any certain\nknowledge of good and evil (including the much-criticized deference to\nthe laws and customs of his country), the fourth rule holds out the\npossibility of cultivating his reason so as to arrive at knowledge of\nthe truth. Echoing his remarks in the Rules, he says that in\nthe discovery of such truths he has experienced \u201csuch extreme\ncontentment that I did not think one could enjoy any sweeter or purer\none in this life\u201d (AT VI 27/CSM I 124). This might be read as\nlimiting our happiness to the contemplation of intellectual truths of\nthe sort announced in Part Four of the Discourse; however,\nDescartes makes it clear that he sees the search for truth as having a\npractical import as well. By following the method he has prescribed\nfor himself and exercising his capacity for judgment, he is confident\nof acquiring all the true knowledge of which he is capable, and\n\u201cin this way all the true goods within my reach\u201d (AT VI\n28/CSM I 125).\n\nIt is evident, then, that the first three maxims of the\n\u201cprovisional moral code\u201d are just that\u2014provisional\nrules that Descartes will follow while he carries out his search for\ncertain knowledge\u2014and that he is confident that this search will\nterminate in knowledge of \u201ctrue goods\u201d that will supply\nreliable directives for action. Descartes hints at the range of these\ngoods in Part Five of the Discourse. They include the\nmaintenance of health, \u201cwhich is undoubtedly the first good\n[le premier bien] and the foundation of all the other goods\nin this life.\u201d Because \u201cthe mind depends so much on the\ntemperament and disposition of the bodily organs,\u201d Descartes\nadds, we must look to medicine if we are \u201cto find some means of\nmaking men in general wiser and more skilful than they have been up\ntill now\u201d (AT VI 62/CSM I 143). The extent of Descartes\u2019\ncommitment to the integration of physical and psychological health\nwill become apparent in the Passions of the Soul. It would be\na mistake, however, to conclude from this that he proposes a reduction\nof ethics to medicine. As presented already in the Discourse,\nhis ethics is founded on an ideal of virtue as a perfected power of\njudgment, together with the assumption that virtue by itself is\nsufficient for happiness:\n\n[S]ince our will tends to pursue or avoid only what our intellect\nrepresents as good or bad, we need only to judge well in order to act\nwell, and to judge as well as we can in order to do our\nbest\u2014that is to say, in order to acquire all the virtues and in\ngeneral all the other goods we can acquire. And when we are certain of\nthis, we cannot fail to be happy. (AT VI 28/CSM I 125)\n\n\nAnticipated in this passage are the core ideas of Descartes\u2019\nethics: the notion of virtue, as a disposition of the will to\njudge in accordance with reason\u2019s representations of the good,\nand the notion of happiness, as a state of mental well-being\nthat is achieved through the practice of virtue. In his correspondence\nwith Princess Elisabeth, Descartes will elaborate on the relationship\nbetween these two ideas. Here is it worth noting that while it is\nvirtue that links ethics to the broader goal of the cultivation of\nreason, Descartes gives no less weight to the importance of happiness,\nin the form of tranquility. This is made clear near the end of the\nDiscourse, when he explains why, in spite of his\nreservations, he has published the book under his own name: \u201cI\nam not excessively fond of glory\u2014indeed if I dare to say so, I\ndislike it in so far as I regard it as opposed to that tranquility\nwhich I value above everything else\u2026. [I]f I had done this [sc.\nconcealed his identity] I thought I would do myself an injustice, and\nmoreover that would have given me a certain sort of disquiet, which\nagain would have been opposed to the perfect peace of mind I am\nseeking\u201d (AT VI 74/CSM I 149).\n",
