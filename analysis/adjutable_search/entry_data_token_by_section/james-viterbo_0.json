    "main_text": "Life and Writings\n1. Life and Writings\n\nJames was born in Viterbo around 1255. Nothing is known about the\nearly years of his life. It is presumed that he joined the order of\nthe Hermits of St. Augustine somewhere around 1272. He is first\nmentioned in 1283 in the capitular acts of the Roman province of his\norder as a recently appointed lecturer (lector) in the\nAugustinian Convent of Viterbo. This means that he must have spent the\nprevious five years (i.e., 1278\u201383) in Paris, as the Augustinian\norder required its lecturers to be trained in theology in that city\nfor a period not exceeding five years. James returned to Paris not\nlong after his appointment in Viterbo, for he is mentioned again in\nthe capitular acts in 1288, this time as baccalaureus\nparisiensis, i.e., as holding a bachelor of theology degree from\nthe University of Paris. After completing his course of studies, James\nwas appointed Master of Theology in 1292 (Wippel 1974) or 1293 (Ypma\n1974), teaching in Paris for the next seven years. His output during\nthat time was considerable. All of his works in speculative theology\nand metaphysics date from the Parisian period. In 1299\u20131300, he\nwas named definitor (i.e., member of the governing council)\nof the Roman province by the general chapter of his order, and in May\nof 1300 he became regent master of the order\u2019s studium\ngenerale in Naples. \u00a0These would be the last two years of\nhis academic career, however, for in September 1302 he was named\nArchbishop of Benevento by Pope Boniface VIII, possibly in gratitude\nfor the support James had shown for the papal cause in his great\ntreatise, De regimine christiano (On Christian\nRulership). In December of the same year, at the request of the\nAngevin King, Charles II, he was transferred to the Archbishopric of\nNaples. He remained in Naples until his death, in 1307 or 1308.\n\nJames wrote the bulk of his philosophically relevant work while in\nParis. Nothing remains of his early production in that city. His\ncommentary on Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences has been lost,\nalthough still extant is a so-called Abbreviatio in I Sententiarum\nAegidii Romani (Summary of the First Book of the Sentences of\nGiles of Rome), which recent scholarship suggests might be\nJames\u2019 preparatory notes for lectures on the Sentences rather\nthan a summary of Giles\u2019 commentary to the same (Tavolaro 2018),\nalthough it is unclear whether these notes were prepared during\nJames\u2019 student years in Paris or whether they date from his\nlater teaching in Naples. Also lost are a treatise on the animation of\nthe heavens (De animatione caelorum), as well as a commentary\non Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics (Expositio primae\nphilosophiae), two works to which James refers explicitly in his\nQuodlibets and which Ypma surmises must have been written during\nJames\u2019 four-year residency as a \u201cformed bachelor\u201d,\ni.e., between 1288 and 1292 (Ypma 1975).\n\nJames\u2019 most significant works written while in Paris are his\nfour quodlibetal questions and thirty-four disputed questions on the\ncategories as they pertain to divine matters (Quaestiones de\npraedicamentis in divinis), although five of them have actually\nnothing to do with theology or the categories, as they deal with the\nhuman will and the habits (see Ypma 1975 for a possible explanation\nregarding their inclusion in the Quaestiones). These two\nworks constitute the most important sources for our knowledge of\nJames\u2019 philosophical thought.\n\nIn Naples, James wrote the work for which he is arguably best known\n(Guti\u00e9rrez 1939: 61\u20132), the De regimine\nchristiano, an important work in the history of late medieval\npolitical thought, and the only philosophical work he wrote in the\nlast eight or so years of his life.\n\nJames is not the author of two works that have been regularly\nattributed to him by scholars, the De perfectione specierum\n(Ypma 1974, Tavolaro 2014), and the Quaestiones septem de\nverbo (Seven Disputed Questions on the Divine Word)\n(Gutti\u00e9rez 1939, Scanzillo 1972, Ypma 1975). The author of the\nDe perfectione specierum is James of Saint Martin (Maier\n1943), or James of Naples, as he is referred to in the manuscripts, an\nAugustinian Hermit who was active in the late fourteenth century; and\nthe author of the Quaestiones septem de verbo, as Stephen\nDumont has recently shown (Dumont 2018b), was James\u2019\nconfr\u00e8re and near-successor at the head of the Augustinian\nschool in Paris, Henry of Friemar. \n\nThe following table provides the list of James\u2019 authentic works\nwith approximate dates of composition. Single asterisks mark those\nwhich have been fully edited; double asterisks indicate those for\nwhich there exist only partial editions:\n\nLectura super IV libros Sententiarum (1286\u20131288)\n Quaestiones Parisius disputatae De praedicamentis in\ndivinis** (1293\u20131295)\n Quaestio de animatione caelorum (1293\u20131296)\n Expositio primae philosophiae (1293\u20131295)\n Quodlibeta quattuor* (1293\u20131298)\n Abbreviatio In Sententiarum Aegidii Romani** (1286\u20131288\nor 1300\u20131302)\n De regimine christiano* (1302)\n Summa de peccatorum distinctione** (1300\u20131308)\n Sermones diversarum rerum** (1303\u20131308)\n Concordantia psalmorum David (1302\u20131308)\n De confessione (1302\u20131308)\n De episcopali officio* (1302\u20131308)\n\n",
