    "main_text": "\n\nThere are roughly two philosophical literatures on\n\u201chappiness,\u201d each corresponding to a different sense of\nthe term. One uses \u2018happiness\u2019 as a value term, roughly\nsynonymous with well-being or flourishing. The other body of work uses\nthe word as a purely descriptive psychological term, akin to\n\u2018depression\u2019 or \u2018tranquility\u2019. An important\nproject in the philosophy of happiness is simply getting clear on what\nvarious writers are talking about: what are the important meanings of\nthe term and how do they connect? While the \u201cwell-being\u201d\nsense of happiness receives significant attention in the contemporary\nliterature on well-being, the psychological notion is undergoing a\nrevival as a major focus of philosophical inquiry, following on recent\ndevelopments in the science of happiness. This entry focuses on the\npsychological sense of happiness (for the well-being notion, see the\nentry on\n well-being).\n The main accounts of happiness in this sense are hedonism, the life\nsatisfaction theory, and the emotional state theory. Leaving verbal\nquestions behind, we find that happiness in the psychological sense\nhas always been an important concern of philosophers. Yet the\nsignificance of happiness for a good life has been hotly disputed in\nrecent decades. Further questions of contemporary interest concern the\nrelation between the philosophy and science of happiness, as well as\nthe role of happiness in social and political decision-making.\n",
