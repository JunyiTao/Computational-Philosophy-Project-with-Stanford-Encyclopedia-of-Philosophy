However, other\ntheorists have regarded the search for this theory as having more\ngloomy prospects. This pessimism has been given a more formal content.\nIt has been held that it can be proven that there is no population\nethics that satisfies a set of apparently plausible adequacy\nconditions on such a theory. In fact, several such proofs have been\nsuggested (Arrhenius 2000b, 2011). What such a theorem would show\nabout ethics is not quite clear. Arrhenius has suggested that an\nimpossibility theorem leaves us with three options: (1) to abandon\nsome of the conditions on which the theorem is based; (2) to become\nmoral sceptics; or (3) to try to explain away the significance of the\nproofs\u2014alternatives which do not invite an easy choice (cf.\nTemkin 2012).\n",
