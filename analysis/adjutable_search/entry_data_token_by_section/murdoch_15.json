    "main_text": "Murdoch on Attention\n10. Murdoch on Attention\n\nFor Murdoch, attention involves activity on our part (more so than in\nWeil), directing the \u201cjust and loving gaze upon an individual\nreality\u201d, as M\u2019s attempt to see D is meant\nto illustrate. Sometimes Murdoch suggests that seeing someone justly\nand lovingly is precisely what is involved in seeing them as they\nreally are [IP: 28/321; OGG: 67/354].\n\nBut Murdoch does not regard mere accuracy as constituting this just\nand loving gaze (IP: 23/317). Learning more details about someone\n(that they like chocolate or are afraid of snakes) is not what\nattention as loving and just provides (Cordner 2016). Moreover, as\nillustrated by the character of Julius King in her novel Fairly\nHonorable Defeat, someone can be very perceptive, very tuned into\naspects of other people\u2019s reality, such as their vanity, and can\nuse this knowledge to manipulate and harm those persons. Julius indeed\nis incapable of loving others at all, and his perceptiveness might\ninvolve accurate, but not just or loving, attention (FHD 1970).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Murdoch thinks that fully recognizing and\nacknowledging that a given other person is as real as oneself does not\ncome naturally to us. Our fantasies and self-absorption get in the\nway; getting past these obstacles is difficult and uncertain and\nconstitutes a genuine moral achievement. Attention is the process by\nwhich we are potentially enabled to do so.\n\nThe \u201cas real as oneself\u201d formulation may be meant to\ncapture two somewhat distinct strands in Murdoch\u2019s view. One is\nthe recognition of the other in her distinct otherness and difference\nfrom oneself, rather than in light of one\u2019s projections onto the\nother that assimilate her to oneself. The second is that the other is\nseen as like oneself, for example as a human being, a person, a\npossessor of dignity. (Murdoch implies but does not articulate this second\nstrand.) Murdoch wants both these strands in what constitutes a moral\ntake on the other, and \u201cjust and loving attention\u201d, even\nif it does not seem equivalent to \u201cappreciating that others are\nas real as oneself\u201d, should probably be understood as\nencompassing both. (Chappell adds a third strand, what it is like to\nbe that other person [Chappell 2018: 103].)\n\nAttention is thus a process by which human persons are enabled to\naccess moral reality. The process is both cognitive and perceptual\n(Murdoch does not attempt to work out their relationship to one\nanother) but for Murdoch those capacities are also moral in character.\nOur moral capacities are part of our cognitive capacities,\nenabling, and required for us to see, the moral and evaluative aspects\nof\n reality.[6]\n",
