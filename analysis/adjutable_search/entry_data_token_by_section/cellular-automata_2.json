    "main_text": "Introduction || A Brief History\n1.3 A Brief History\n\nThe father of CA is John von Neumann (von Neumann 1951). Working on\nself-replication and attempting to provide a reductionist theory of\nbiological development, von Neumann was trying to conceive a system\ncapable of producing exact copies of itself. Now biology prima\nfacie appears to be the realm of fluidity and continuous\ndynamics. But following a suggestion of his colleague Stanislaw Ulam,\nvon Neumann decided to focus on a discrete, two-dimensional system.\nInstead of just black-or-white cells, von\nNeumann\u2019s automaton used 29 different states and rather\ncomplicated dynamics, and was capable of self-reproduction. Von\nNeumann\u2019s CA was also the first discrete parallel computational\nmodel in history formally shown to be a universal computer, i.e.,\ncapable of emulating a universal Turing machine and computing all\n recursive functions (see entry).\n \n\nIn the early Sixties, E.F. Moore (1962) and Myhill (1963) proved the\nGarden-of-Eden theorems stating conditions for the existence of\nso-called Gardens of Eden, i.e., patterns that cannot appear on the\nlattice of a CA except as initial conditions. Gustav Hedlund (1969)\ninvestigated cellular automata within the framework of symbolic\ndynamics. In 1970 the mathematician John Conway introduced his\naforementioned Life game (Berkelamp, Conway, & Guy 1982),\narguably the most popular automaton ever, and one of the simplest\ncomputational models ever proved to be a universal computer. In 1977,\nTommaso Toffoli used cellular automata to directly model physical\nlaws, laying the foundations for the study of reversible CA (Toffoli\n1977).\n\nStephen Wolfram\u2019s works in the 1980s contributed to putting the\ngrowing community of CA followers on the scientific map. In a series\nof papers, Wolfram extensively explored one-dimensional CA, providing\nthe first qualitative taxonomy of their behavior and laying the\ngroundwork for further research. A particular transition rule for\none-dimensional CA, known as Rule 110, was conjectured to be\nuniversal by Wolfram. Some twenty years after the conjecture, Matthew\nCook proved that Rule 110 is capable of universal computation\n(Cook 2004; Wolfram 2002 also contains a sketch of the proof). \n",
