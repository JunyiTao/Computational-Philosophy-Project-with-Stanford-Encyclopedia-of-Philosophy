Interpretability is a good criterion for\nfixing a comparison between theories \\(T\\) and \\(T^{\\prime }\\), for it\nis characterized either in terms of \u201cuniform definability of\nmodels\u201d or of \u201cthe existence of an interpretation map\nwhich preserves logical form and provability\u201d (Mceldowney 2020:\n15). It is also helpful for proving consistency, as \\(T^{\\prime }\\) is\nproved to be consistent when interpreted in a consistent \\(T\\).\nHowever, interpretability between theories of a many-sorted signature\ndoes not guarantee interpretability between their (one-sorted)\ntranslations.\n\nMceldowney (2020) argues that the concept of bi-interpretability is\nthe best measure of theoretical equivalence in MSL. The oldest\ncriterion for theoretical equivalence between first-order theories\nwith the same signature is the notion of definitional\nequivalence (see Eilenberg & Mac Lane 1942, 1945 and Glymour\n1971). Therefore, the necessity of a many-sorted counterpart was\napparent. As a result, a debate on the nature of equivalence in MSL\nhas taken place since 2016. Barrett and Halvorson (2016) generalizes\nthe idea of definitional extension to the concept of Morita\nextension: intuitively, \\(T^+\\) is a Morita extension of \\(T\\)\niff both \\(T\\) and \\(T^+\\) are MSL theories and \\(T^+\\) \u201csays no\nmore\u201d than the original theory (see 2016: 565 for formal\ndetails).\n\nThus, they claim that theoretical equivalence in MSL is to have a\ncommon Morita extension (this is called \u201cMorita\nequivalence\u201d). It is worth recalling at this point that the\nMorita extension \\(T^{+}\\) of \\(T\\) might be constructed by adding new\nsort symbols to the signature of \\(T\\) together with the corresponding\nexplicit\n definitions[33]\n to the axioms. There are several ways to carry out this extension:\nthe new sort \\(\\tau\\) can be introduced as a subsort,\nproduct, coproduct and quotient sort (see\nBarrett & Halvorson 2016: 563\u201364). Morita equivalence has\nalso been used to try to clarify what is known in the literature as\nQuine\u2019s conjecture on many-sorted logic (see Barrett &\nHalvorson 2017).\n\nNevertheless, according to Mceldowney (2020), a nuanced concept of\nMorita equivalence is just a special case of bi-interpretability. For\nthis reason, he opted for a notion of equivalence in MSL based on\ninterpretability rather than Morita extensions (see pp. 404-407 in\nMceldowney 2020). In fact, as pointed out in Friedman and Visser\n(2014), bi-interpretability preserves finite axiomatizability,\ndecidability, and \u03ba-categoricity.\n",
