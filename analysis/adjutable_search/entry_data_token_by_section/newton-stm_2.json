    "main_text": "The Legacy from Antiquity || Aristotle's Doctrines\n2.2 Aristotle's Doctrines\n\n According to Aristotle, the universe is a material plenum, finite in\nextent, bounded by the outermost sphere of the fixed stars. Beyond\nthat there is no void, i.e., empty places, since, as Aristotle defines\n\u2018place\u2019, the place of something is the outermost of \u201cthe\ninnermost motionless boundary of what contains it.\u201d Hence, since there\nare no boundaries outside the outermost celestial sphere, there are no\nplaces or space outside of it.  \n\n Time, according to Aristotle, is just the measure of motion, where by\n\u2018motion\u2019 he means change of any sort, including\nqualitative change. In order to define the uniformity of time, that\nis, the notion of equal intervals of time, Aristotle was guided by\nastronomical practice, which in antiquity provided the most practical and accurate measures of time. He identified uniform motion with the rate of motion of\nthe fixed stars, a choice for which he found a dynamical justification\nin his celestial physics.  \n\n \u201cLocal\u201d motion is but one species of motion, viz., change of\nplace. Motion, in general, he defined as the actualization of\npotentiality, a notion commonly held in the 17th century to be so\nobscure as to be either useless or meaningless. However, as far as\nlocal motion is concerned, there is no difficulty as to what\nconstitutes the true or absolute motion of a body in a finite\ngeocentric universe. Indeed, elementary substances in the sub-lunar\nrealm (earth, air, fire, and water) move of their own accord either up\nor down, i.e., toward the center or away from the center by their very\nnature. The celestial realm, beginning with the orbit of the moon,\nconsists of an interlocking network of celestial spheres composed of a\nfifth element (aether), which by its nature is disposed to circular\nmotion about the center of the of universe (i.e., the center of the\nearth). If the motion of this substance is taken to be the measure of\ntime, the celestial spheres necessarily rotate uniformly. Since the\nnet motion of an embedded sphere is the sum of its natural motion\nsuperimposed on the natural motions of the spheres in which it is\nembedded, and since the axes of rotation are in general set at\nslightly different angles in order to account for why the sun does not\nmove on the celestial equator and the planets and the moon do not move\nstrictly on the ecliptic (i.e., the path of the sun against the fixed\nstars), the motions of the moon, planets, and even the sun are not\nnecessarily uniform. However, since the sphere of the fixed stars is\nembedded in no other celestial sphere in motion, the motion of the\nfixed stars is de facto the measure of all motion.  \n\n The motions spoken of so far are all natural motions of the\nsubstances in questions, motions induced by the body being the very\nsubstance that it is. In contrast, other motions, in which the cause\nof the motion is external rather that internal to the body, Aristotle\nsubsumed under the concept of violent motion. Violent motion\nrequired for its continuation the constant application of an external\ncause.  \n",
