    "main_text": "Interdisciplinary Approaches || Crip Theory\n2.1 Crip Theory\n\nQueer theory and critical disability theory productively collude under\nthe umbrella of \u201ccrip theory\u201d, pushing understanding\nforward in both arenas and along new lines (McRuer 2003, 2004, and\n2006a; Mollow 2017; Schalk 2013). Queer theory and disability theory\nhave shared interests, including challenging medicalization, and some\nargue that the AIDS crisis catalyzed the connection between the two\n(e.g., Mollow 2017, 342). Further, crip theory derives from disability\nstudies but uses queer theory to develop new analyses (Schalk 2013).\nConsider, for example, questions of passing and coming out, fruitfully\nanalyzed at the nexus of queer theory and disability theory (see\nGarland Thomson 2002: 21). Crip theorist Robert McRuer argues that\ncrip theory \n\n\nshould be understood as having a similar contestatory relationship to\ndisability studies and identity that queer theory has to LGBT studies\nand identity. (2006b: 35) \n\n\nExpanding on this, Alison Kafer describes McRuer\u2019s work (e.g.,\n2006b) as placing \u201ccrip theory in a contestatory relationship to\nliberal notions of acceptance, tolerance, and assimilation\u201d\n(2009: 292). For example, McRuer \u201cbuilds on queer critiques of\nneoliberalism\u201d, by adding, for instance, to existing queer\nanalyses of the World Bank as a site of heteronormativity by\ndescribing its ableism or \u201cantidisability\u201d logic (Kafer\n2009: 291). Crip theorists insist on the idea that full analysis of\nthis and other sites of interest require both \u201cqueer\nand disability theory\u201d (ibid., cf. McRuer\n2003, 2005, 2006a). These sites include the cultural imperatives of\nheterosexuality and able-bodiedness, which are significantly tied\ntogether (Kafer 2003).\n\nWith this in mind, the study of sexuality is one obvious site for crip\ntheory (McRuer 2011; McRuer & Mollow 2012). Literature taking a\ncrip theory approach to sexuality is varied, and much of it intersects\nwith race. Here noted are a few prominent examples. Eli Clare has\nwritten extensively, in both personal and political registers, at the\nintersection of queer experience and disability (e.g., 1999, 2001,\n2013). Ann Mollow theorizes the ambiguity of disabled sexuality in\nterms of both lack and excess, connecting her insights to\npsychoanalysis (2012). Lydia X. Z. Brown writes about relationships\nand sexuality from and for an autistic perspective (2013). Kenny\nFries, the author of several significant memoirs linking disability\nand sexuality (2003, 2007, 2017), writes about beauty and body image\n(1995 [1998]). Michael Gill, whose work focuses on sexual agency and\nintellectual disability, including sexual abuse and consent (2010,\n2015), analyzed an online reality show entitled The Specials\n(2012). The article interrogates an episode in which an encounter\namong five white intellectually disabled adults and sex workers from\nBangkok raises questions of consent and sex and gender transgression\n(ibid.). In response to the history of racism and\nableism\u2019s explosive and continued violence in the U.S., Michelle\nJarman theorizes the \u201ceugenic castration of cognitively disabled\nmen\u201d in order to claim that \u201creading race and disability\nas interrelated, dynamic processes can inform our understanding of\nboth past and present violence\u201d (2012: 89\u201390). Ellen\nSamuels theorizes the limits of the language of coming out of the\ncloset in crip terms (2003). Meanwhile, Alexandre Baril uses a crip\nframework to engage a variety of questions connected to trans identity\nand disability, including anglonormativity, cisnormativity, debility,\nand transability (2015a, 2015b, 2015c, 2016; Baril & Trevenen\n2014).\n\nThese questions related to sexuality do not exhaust the possibilities\nof crip theory; as McRuer\u2019s work makes clear, crip theory\nextends to a variety of concepts using the springboard of queer and\ndisability theory. Indeed, crip theory is highly inclusive and invites\ncoalitions among pathologized persons, in the tradition of critical\ndisability theory more generally. Sami Schalk notes that \n\n\nAlison Kafer has argued that crip theory allows for the inclusion of\n\u201cthose who lack a \u2018proper\u2019 (read: medically\nacceptable, doctor provided, and insurer-approved) diagnosis for their\nsymptoms\u201d and \u201cpeople identifying with disability and\nlacking not only a diagnosis but any \u2018symptoms\u2019 of\nimpairment\u201d. (Kafer 2013: 12, 13, as quoted in Schalk 2017) \n\n\nFor instance, Schalk\u2019s productive\n\u201cdisidentification\u201d with crip theory has led her to take\non, as a queer black non-disabled woman, the language of crip theory\nin new academic and political engagements (2013).\n\nFinally, and significantly, crip theory has taken up the question of\nfuturity; that is, access to the future and dreams about the future.\nThis includes the complex politics of reproduction (e.g., Jarman 2015)\nbut stands in contrast to what some describe as queer theory\u2019s\nanti-futurity emphasis (e.g., K. Hall 2014). This thread of crip\ntheory is explicitly set up against neoliberalism and the assumption\nthat disability marks a \u201clife not worth living\u201d and a\n\u201cfuture no one wants\u201d (Fritsch 2016: 11, cf. Kafer 2013:\n1\u20133). As Kafer describes it, if disability is understood as\ntragedy, futures without disability become the only desirable futures\n(2013: 1). Yet, disability is not a fact about the body with static\nmeanings; instead, our orientation toward the future, especially\ndesires about a future without disability, have material impacts and\ncan be politically leveraged to reshape the meanings and impacts of\ndisability (M. Hall 2016). Indeed, these desires and orientations are\nfactors upon which some persons flourish and some do not. Kelly\nFritsch writes, \n\n\nThe withering of some disabled lives and the capacitation of others\nresult from neoliberal material and discursive processes that orient\nand imagine disability as a life without a future unless capacitated\nthrough such biocapitalist practices as cures or body/mind enhancement\ntechnologies and procedures. (2016: 11\u201312) \n\n\nResistance comes from insisting on a crip future and an accessible\nfuture (Kafer 2013: 153). Of the dream of disability to come, McRuer\nwrites, \n\n\nThe disability to come\u2026will and should always belong to the\ntime of the promise\u2026It\u2019s a crip promise that we will\nalways comprehend disability otherwise and that we will, collectively,\nsomehow access other worlds and futures. (2006b: 207\u2013208, as\nquoted in Kafer 2009: 293) \n\n\nSimilarly, Kim Q. Hall supports radical hope for just access to the\nfuture and argues that such hope has wide-ranging impacts, for not\nonly queer, crip, and feminist movements, but also mitigating climate\nchange (2014). Rayna Rapp and Faye Ginsburg, along the same lines,\nseek the collaborative creation of inhabitable worlds, focusing on the\nfuturity of disability and leveraging demographic studies to\n\u201cmake disability count\u201d for the future rather than\n\u201ccounting disability\u201d in the future (Ginsburg & Rapp\n2015, see also Ginsburg & Rapp 2017).\n\nThis focus on futurity links tightly with the tradition of critical\ntheory. For instance, Fritsch, using Theodor Adorno\u2019s conception\nof negative dialectics, argues that disability is a central part of\nthe \u201csensuous critical thought\u201d that is required for\ncritique and living otherwise (2013, cf. Adorno 1966 [1973: 11]).\nAdorno describes a world dominated by homogenizing \u201cidentity\nthinking\u201d that \u201cerases contradiction, antagonism, and\ndifference\u201d and \u201caids and abets capitalism\u201d. Yet,\nthe queer/disabled figure, the \u201ctransfigured crip\u201d, is a\nmisfit that can \u201chaunt the able-bodied world\u201d of\ndifference-refusing identity thinking (2013). Fritsch is thus hopeful\nthat the transfigured crip can break open identity thinking. She\nwrites, \n\n\nthe transfigured crip, through the assertion that there is always a\nremainder that exposes contradictions and haunts the limits of\nthought, will pose the greatest challenge to, and undo, both\nneoliberal capitalism and the category of disability itself. In taking\nthe differences and similarities of our sufferings seriously,\ncritically, and reflectively, we open up spaces, cracks, and\npossibilities for the difference of uncomfortable crip communities to\ncome.
