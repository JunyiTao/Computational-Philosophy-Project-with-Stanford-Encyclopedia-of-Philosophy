    "main_text": "Life and Works || Scotus\u2019s works\n1.2 Scotus\u2019s works\n\nIt is generally agreed that Scotus\u2019s earliest works were his\ncommentaries on the Old Logic: questions on Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge and Aristotle\u2019s Categories, two sets\nof questions on Peri hermeneias, and De sophisticis\nelenchis. These probably date to around 1295; the Quaestiones\nsuper De anima is also very likely an early work (the editors\ndate it to the late 1280s or early 1290s). Scotus\u2019s other\nAristotelian commentary, the Quaestiones super libros\nMetaphysicorum Aristotelis, seems to have been started early; but\nBooks VI through IX are all late or were at least revised later in\nScotus\u2019s career. Scotus also wrote an Expositio on\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics. It had been unidentified for\ncenturies but was recently identified and edited by Giorgio Pini.\n\nThings really get complicated when we come to Scotus\u2019s\ncommentaries on the four books of Sentences of Peter Lombard,\nsince he commented on the Sentences more than once and\nrevised his lectures over a long period; the relations among the\nvarious versions that have come down to us are not always clear.\nCertainly the Lectura presents us with Scotus\u2019s Oxford\nlectures on Books I and II of the Sentences in 1298\u201399.\nThere is an Ordinatio (i.e., a version prepared for\npublication by the author himself) of lectures at Oxford, based in\npart on the Lectura and on material from his lectures in\nParis. The Ordinatio, which Scotus seems to have been\nrevising up to his death, is generally taken to be Scotus\u2019s\npremier work; the critical edition was at last completed in 2013.\nFinally, Scotus lectured on the Sentences at Paris, and there\nare various Reportationes of these lectures. A critical\nedition is in progress; at present we have a transcription of a\nreasonably reliable manuscript of Book I. Although the Paris lectures\nthemselves were later than the Oxford lectures, it seems probable that\nparts of the Ordinatio\u2014Book IV and perhaps also Book\nIII\u2014are later than the corresponding parts of the\nReportatio.\n\nIn addition to these works, we have 46 short disputations called\nCollationes dating from 1300\u20131305, a late work in\nnatural theology called De primo principio, and\nQuaestiones Quodlibetales from Scotus\u2019s days as regent\nmaster (either Advent 1306 or Lent 1307). Finally, there is a work\ncalled Theoremata. Though doubts have been raised about its\nauthenticity, the recent critical edition accepts it as a genuine work\nof Scotus.\n",
