    "main_text": "The Case for Definable Determinacy || Large Cardinals\n4.3  Large Cardinals\n\nLarge cardinal axioms are taken (by those who study them) to have\ncertain degrees of intrinsic plausibility. As we noted above, large\ncardinal axioms imply forms of definable determinacy and so the latter\ninherit the considerations in favour of the former. \n\n Theorem 4.3 (Martin, Steel, and Woodin). Assume ZFC and that there are \u03c9 many Woodin cardinals with a measurable above them all. Then ADL(\u211d).  \n\n\n In fact, it turns out that the existence of certain inner\nmodels of large cardinal axioms is sufficient to prove definable\ndeterminacy. Since it is (arguably) even more plausible that there are\nsuch inner models, this (arguably) strengthens the case. So definable\ndeterminacy is a fruitful consequence of the existence of such inner\nmodels. \n\n However, just as in the previous subsection, one would like some\nassurance that there are not incompatible axioms that share this\nfruitful consequence. Remarkably, this turns out to be the\ncase\u2014axioms of definable determinacy are\nactually equivalent to axioms asserting the existence of\ninner models of large cardinals. We discuss what is known about this\nconnection, starting with a low level of boldface definable\ndeterminacy and proceeding upward. It should be emphasized that our\nconcern here is not merely with consistency strength but rather with\noutright equivalence (over \n ZFC).[12] \n\n Theorem 4.4 (Woodin). The following are equivalent:\n \u0394\u033012-determinacy. \nFor all x \u2208 \u03c9\u03c9, there is an inner model M such that x \u2208 M and M \u22a7 \u201cThere is a Woodin cardinal\u201d. \n\n\n Theorem 4.5 (Woodin). The following are equivalent:\n PD (Schematic). \nFor every n < \u03c9, there is a fine-structural, countably iterable inner model M such that M \u22a7 \u201cThere are n Woodin cardinals\u201d.\n\n\n Theorem 4.6 (Woodin). The following are equivalent:\n ADL(\u211d).\nIn L(\u211d), for every set S of ordinals, there is an inner model M and an \u03b1 < \u03c9L(\u211d)1 such that S \u2208 M and M \u22a7 \u201c\u03b1 is a Woodin cardinal\u201d.\n\n\n Theorem 4.7 (Woodin). The following are equivalent:\n ADL(\u211d) and \u211d\u266f exists. \nM\u266f\u03c9 exists and is countably iterable. \n\n\n Theorem 4.8 (Woodin). The following are equivalent:\n For all B,  VB \u22a7 ADL(\u211d).  \nM\u266f\u03c9 exists and is fully iterable. \n\n\n\n\n Summary: Large cardinal axioms are sufficient to prove definable\ndeterminacy and inner models of large cardinal axioms are necessary to\nprove definable determinacy. In fact, through a series of deep\nresults, these two conceptually distinct approaches to new axioms are\nultimately seen to be at root equivalent. \n",
