One of the central themes addressed\nin Mexico in this kind of history is evolutionary biology, in\nparticular the history of the reception and development of Darwinism\nin Mexico and its connection with positivism. This has been analyzed\nby biologists, historians, and philosophers of biology Rosaura Ruiz\nand Ana Barahona, two of the most influential and best-known promoters\nnot only of the conceptual history of biology but also of the history\nof biology in general, including its institutional history, as well as\nthe philosophy of biology in Mexico.\n\nFollowing Ivette Conry\u2019s (1974) argument that the introduction\nof Darwinism in a country implies that it becomes operative within\nbiology and is applied to the interpretation of biological facts, and\nnot only to their mention or discussion, Ruiz (1987, 1996) analyzes\nDarwinism in Mexico. She points out that the first known discussion of\nDarwinism in Mexico, starting with the lecture given in February 1877\nby Pedro Noriega at the Gabino Barreda Methodofile Society,\nwas mainly concerned with philosophical issues, such that the\nintroduction of evolutionism to biology did not occur in Mexico at the\nend of the nineteenth century, when biology was still in its\nbeginnings.\n\nAmong Ana Barahona\u2019s numerous publications on the history of\nbiology, especially on the history of genetics in Mexico (Barahona\n& Gaona 2001; Barahona, Pinar & Ayala 2003, 2005; Barahona\n& Ayala 2005; Barahona 2008, 2009, 2010, 2013; Barahona &\nRichmond 2020; Alonso-Pav\u00f3n et al. 2021), are those in which\nshe takes up Ruiz\u2019s analysis and complements it by pointing out\nthat it was Justo Sierra who first made Darwin\u2019s ideas known in\nMexico in 1875, triggering the debate that took place both in\nscientific societies and the press (Barahona & Ledesma 2002;\nLedesma & Barahona 2003; Barahona 2009). The analysis of visual\nrepresentations in the history of biology constitutes another\nBarahona\u2019s lines of research (Barahona 2007), which is followed\nby Mexican biologist and historian of science Erica Torrens in\nrelation to representation through diagrams, such as those used in\nnatural history and evolutionary biology (Torrens & Barahona 2012,\n2013, 2014), or through images and pictures to represent Homo\nsapiens and racial hierarchies (Torrens 2019).\n\nIn\n Section 4.1,\n we mentioned one of Brazil\u2019s most prominent Darwin specialists,\nAnna Carolina K. P. Regner, in connection with her critique of the\nconception of Darwin\u2019s theory in terms of the classical view,\nparticularly her critique of the hypothetico-deductive reconstructions\nof Darwin\u2019s short argument and her analysis of his\none long argument. Expanding on the latter, Regner makes a\nvery detailed analysis of the structure and the functioning of\nDarwinian argumentation. As an analytical too, she adopts\nDascal\u2019s typology of polemic interactions, in particular his\nanalyses of controversies and their role in scientific argumentation,\nand his concept of soft rationality (Regner 2014): one that\nweighs reasons for and against, whose logic is non-monotonic and\ncannot be reduced to standard deductive logic, and that unlike\ndeduction, in Leibniz\u2019s words, \u201cinclines without\nnecessitating\u201d (Dascal 1998, 2005). Regner also adopts\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric as a tool of analysis. She then\nsystematically reconstructs Darwin\u2019s argumentative strategies in\nOrigin, showing a juxtaposition between the rhetorical\nprocedures recommended by Aristotle and those adopted by Darwin, which\n\u201cpersuade without demonstrating\u201d. She describes the\nparticular whole-part movement, Darwin\u2019s appeal to the\nexplanatory power as a whole, the comparison of his view with those of\nhis opponents, the treatment of difficulties/objections, the interplay\nof the actual and the possible, and the weight of reasons (Regner\n2007, 2014) and also explores the interactions that took place in the\nscientific controversy between Darwin and Mivart, in particular the\nargumentative strategies employed by them (Regner 2008).\n\nAnother detailed analysis of Darwin\u2019s argumentation,\nparticularly of the one he developed in relation to the origin of\ndomestic pigeons (Darwin 1859: Chap. 1; 1868: Vol. I, Chaps.\n5\u20136), is carried out by Brazilian physicist, historian, and\nphilosopher of science Roberto de Andrade Martins (2012). Andrade\nMartins is mainly a historian and philosopher of physics but has also\nmade contributions in the field of the history of biology, where he\nstresses methodological, foundational and dynamical aspects of\nscientific work (L. Martins & R. Martins 1996; R. Martins 2005)\nand contributes to the education of new generations of philosophers\nand historians of science in Brazil, including in the field of\nbiology. In his analysis of Darwin\u2019s study of pigeons, Martins\nhighlights the relevance of Darwin\u2019s claim that all known breeds\nwere produced from a single species, Columba livia or the\nrock pigeon, since the differences between the several domestic breeds\nis so large that, if they were found in the wild, they could be\nclassified as different species or genera, as well as the relevance of\nan experiment crossing widely different breeds, which led Darwin to\nobtain pigeons similar to wild species. Andrade Martins\u2019s\nanalysis shows the extreme care Darwin took in his attempt to provide\nstrong arguments for his theory.\n\nHowever, not all conceptual analyses of history of biology are limited\nto evolutionary biology. There are also analyses of theories of\nheredity and genetics, both in their relation to evolutionary biology\nand in their independent treatment. To the analyses on heredity and\ngenetics already mentioned in\n Sections 5.1\u20135.3,\n we would like to add those by Brazilians Luzia Casta\u00f1eda and\nLilian Al-Chueyr Pereira Martins, both of whom trained with Roberto de\nAndrade Martins. Whereas biologist and historian of science Luzia\nCasta\u00f1eda analyzes Buffon\u2019s and Bonnet\u2019s ideas on\nreproduction and heredity (Casta\u00f1eda 1995) and the idea of\nacquired characters in Lamarck, Darwin, and Weismann (Casta\u00f1eda\n1997), biologist, historian, and philosopher of science Lilian\nAl-Chueyr Pereira Martins carries out numerous and very careful\nanalyses linked to conceptual and methodological aspects, in addition\nto the history of evolution, particularly of Lamarck\u2019s work (L.\nMartins 2007) and early genetics, mainly Bateson\u2019s work and the\nchromosomal theory of inheritance (L. Martins 1998, 1999a, b, 2006,\n2010, 2013, 2020; L. Martins & Prestes 2013).\n",
