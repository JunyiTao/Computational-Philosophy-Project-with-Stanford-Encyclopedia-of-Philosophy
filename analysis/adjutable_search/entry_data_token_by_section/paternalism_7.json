    "main_text": "Normative Issues\n3. Normative Issues\n\nIs there a burden of proof attached to paternalism? Does the\npaternalist or anti-paternalist have to give a reason for their\naction? As we have seen the analysis of paternalism seems to cut both\nways. It is an interference with liberty which might be thought to\nplace the burden of proof on the paternalist. It is an act intended to\nproduce good for the agent which might be thought to place the burden\nof proof on those who object to paternalism. It might be thought, as\nMill did, that the burden of proof is different depending on who is\nbeing treated paternalistically. If it is a child then the assumption\nis that, other things being equal, the burden of proof is on those who\nresist paternalism. If it is an adult of sound mind the presumption is\nreversed.\n\nSuppose we start from the presumption that paternalism is wrong. The\nquestion becomes under what, if any, circumstances, can the\npresumption be overcome? The possible answers are \u201cunder no\ncircumstances\u201d, \u201cunder some circumstances\u201d, and\n\u201cunder any circumstances\u201d\n\nThe last seems very implausible. Essentially it is the view that the\nfact that an act is (intended to be) beneficial for a person, and does\nnot affect or violate the interests of others, settles the question of\nwhether it may be done. Only a view which ignores the means by which\ngood is promoted, and the ethical status of such means, can hold this.\nAny sensible view has to distinguish between good done to agents at\ntheir request or with their consent, and good thrust upon them against\ntheir will.\n\nSo the normative options seem to be just two. Either we are never\npermitted to aim at doing good for others against their wishes, and in\nways which limit their liberty, or we are permitted to do so.\n\nWhy might one think that at least the state may never do so? One might\nthink so because of various beliefs about the impossibility of in fact\ndoing good for people against their will or because one thinks that\nalthough possible to do good it is in fact inconsistent with some\nnormative standard which ought to prevail.\n\nWith respect to the impossibility question one might believe either\nthat it is not possible to do any good by acting paternalistically or\nthat although it is possible to do some good the process will (almost)\nalways produce bads which outweigh the good.\n\nIf one thought that (almost) always more harm than good is done by the\nstate when it acts paternalistically this raises the question of\nwhether we can distinguish the conditions in which (rarely) more good\nthan harm is done and build that into our guidelines. If this is\npossible, and allowing paternalism in these exceptional cases does not\ncreate further harms which outweigh the good produced, then we should\nsometimes be paternalists. If it is impossible to distinguish the\n\u201cgood\u201d from the \u201cbad\u201d cases then, at least if\nwe are rule consequentialists, we ought not to have such a rule; and\nwe ought not to try and make the distinctions on a case by case\nbasis.\n\nBut one might believe that the question of whether more good than harm\nis produced is not simply an empirical one. It depends on our\nunderstanding of the good of persons. If the good simply included\nitems such as longer life, greater health, more income, or less\ndepression, then it makes it look like an empirical issue. But if we\nconceive of the good of individuals as including items such as being\nrespected as an independent agent, having a right to make decisions\nfor oneself, or having one\u2019s autonomy not infringed, then the\nissue of whether the agent is better off after being paternalised is\npartly a normative matter. One might believe that one cannot make\npeople better off by infringing their autonomy in the same way that\nsome people believe one cannot make a person better off by putting\nthem in a Nozickian experience machine (one in which they are floating\nin a tank but seem to be having all kinds of wonderful experiences).\nCompare Mill\u2019s statement that \u201c\u2026a man\u2019s mode\nof laying out his own existence is best not because it is the best in\nitself, but because it is his own mode\u2026\u201d (1859: Chapter\nIII).\n\nKantian views are frequently absolutistic in their objections to\npaternalism. On these views we must always respect the rational agency\nof other persons. To deny an adult the right to make their own\ndecisions, however mistaken from some standpoint they are, is to treat\nthem as simply means to their own good, rather than as ends in\nthemselves. In a way anti-paternalism is already incorporated into\nKantian theories by their prohibition against lying and\nforce\u2014the main instruments of paternalistic interference. Since\nthese instrumentalities are already denied even to prevent individuals\nfrom harming others, they will certainly be forbidden to prevent them\nfrom harming themselves. Of course, one may object to the former\nabsolutism while accepting the latter.\n\nIf one believes that sometimes paternalism is justifiable one may do\nso for various kinds of theoretical reasons. The broadest is simply\nconsequentialist, i.e., more good than harm is produced. A narrower\njustification is that sometimes the individual\u2019s (long-run)\nautonomy is advanced by restricting his autonomy (short-run). So one\nmight prevent people from taking mind-destroying drugs on the grounds\nthat allowing them to do so destroys their autonomy and preventing\nthem from doing so preserves it. This is essentially Mill\u2019s\nargument against allowing people to contract into slavery. Note that\nif the theory of the good associated with a particular\nconsequentialism is broad enough, i.e., includes autonomy as one of\nthe goods, it can be equivalent to the autonomy theory (assuming that\nthe structure of the autonomy view is a maximizing one).\n\nA different theoretical basis is (moral) contractualism. On this view\nif there are cases of justified paternalism they are justified on the\nbasis that we (all of us) would agree to such interference, given\nsuitable knowledge and suitable motivation. So, for instance, it might\nbe argued that since we know we are subject to depression we all would\nagree, at least, to short-term anti-suicide interventions, to\ndetermine whether we are suffering from such a condition, and to\nattempt to cure it. More generally, we might accept what Feinberg\ncalled \u201csoft paternalism.\u201d This is the view that when we\nare not acting fully voluntarily it is permissible to intervene to\nprovide information, or to point out defects in our rationality, but\nthat if we then do make a voluntary choice it must be respected. Or we\nmight agree to being forced to wear seat-belts knowing our disposition\nto discount future benefits for present ones. The justification here\nis neither consequentialist nor based simply on the preservation of\nautonomy. Rather either kind of consideration may be taken into\naccount, as well as others, in determining what we would reasonably\nagree to.\n",
