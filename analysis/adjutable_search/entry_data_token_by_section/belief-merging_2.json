    "main_text": "Belief Merging || The distance-based approach\n2.2 The distance-based approach\n\nAn IC model-based fusion operator selects, among the models\nof the integrity constraints IC, those that are preferred,\nwhere the preference relation depends on the operator that is used.\nThus, the collective belief set \\(\\Delta_{\\IC}(E)\\) is guaranteed to\nbe a set of formulas that are true in all of the selected models and\nto satisfy the IC. In the example of the city council seen\nearlier, this means that building a playground and a parking lot will\nnever be selected as a decision outcome. The preference information\nusually takes the form of a total pre-order (to recall, a pre-order is\na reflexive and transitive relation) \\(\\le\\) on the interpretations\ninduced by a notion of distance d between an interpretation\n\\(\\omega\\) and the profile E, denoted by \\(d(\\omega,E)\\).\nIntuitively, this is to select a collective outcome that is the\nclosest (with respect to some notion of distance to be specified) to\nall individual belief bases while satisfying the integrity\nconstraints. It should be noted that a distance-based fusion operator\ndoes not always guarantee a unique result. We will come back to this\npoint when we look at the application of belief merging to judgment\naggregation.\n\nWe have seen that majority operators are characterized by trying to\nminimize the total dissatisfaction, whereas the arbitration operators\naim at minimizing the local dissatisfaction. We can thus see the\ndistance as a way to capture the notion of dissatisfaction. Inspired\nby the economy principle employed in belief revision, the\noutcome in merging should keep as much as information as possible from\neach individual belief base \\(K_i\\). In other words, since\nthe sources of information are assumed to be equally reliable, the\nmerge should delete as little as possible from the sources. The idea\nthen is to select the interpretations that minimize the distance\nbetween the models of IC and the models of the belief profile\nE. Formally, this can be expressed as follows: \n\n\\[\n\\mymod(\\Delta_{\\IC}(E)) = \\mymin (\\mymod (\\IC), \\le_{d})\n\\]\n\n\nA distance d between interpretations is a total function \\(d: W\n\\times W \\rightarrow R^{+}\\) such that for all \\(\\omega, \\omega'\\in\nW\\):\n\n \\(d(\\omega ,\\omega') = d(\\omega',\\omega )\\)\n\\(d(\\omega ,\\omega') = 0 \\textrm{ iff } \\omega =\\omega'\\).\n\n\nThe first point states that the distance is symmetric. Suppose there\nare three belief bases: \\(K_1 = K_3 = \\{a, b, \\neg c, d\\}\\) and \\(K_2\n= \\{\\neg a, b, c, d\\}\\). If we denote by \\(\\omega_i\\) the\ninterpretation of \\(K_i\\), we have \\(\\omega_1 = \\omega_3 = (1,1,0,1)\\)\nand \\(\\omega_2 = (0,1,1,1)\\). The first point requires that\n\\(d(\\omega_1 ,\\omega_2) = d(\\omega_2 ,\\omega_1)\\). The second point\nstates that if two interpretations are identical, the distance is 0,\nso \\(d(\\omega_1 ,\\omega_3) =\n 0\\).[2]\n\nTwo steps are needed to find the models of IC that minimize\nthe distances to the belief profile. In the first step, we calculate\nthe distance between each interpretation satisfying IC (that\nis, each candidate merged base) and each individual belief base. The\nintuition here is to quantify how far each individual opinion is from\neach possible collective outcome (recall that the outcomes will be\nselected among the interpretations satisfying IC). In the\nsecond step, we need to aggregate all those individual distances to\ndefine the collective distance, that is, the distance of the belief\nprofile to each model of IC. This amounts to quantify how far\nthe group is from each possible outcome. Finally, the (possibly more\nthan one) base that minimizes such distance is selected as an\noutcome.\n\nFor the first step, we need to define the distance between an\ninterpretation \\(\\omega\\) and a belief base K. This is the\nminimal distance between \\(\\omega\\) and the models of K.\nFormally: \\(d(\\omega, K) = \\mymin_{\\omega'\\in \\mymod(K)} d(\\omega,\n\\omega')\\). If K has more than one model (e.g., \\(K_i = \\{a\n\\vee b\\}\\) has three models: \\(\\{(0,1) (1,0), (1,1)\\}\\)), \\(\\omega'\\)\nwill be the closest to \\(\\omega\\).\n\nWe can now define the distance between an interpretation \\(\\omega\\)\nand a belief profile E, which is needed for the second step. We\nneed an aggregation function \\(D: R^{+n} \\rightarrow R^{+}\\) that\ntakes the distances between the models of IC and the belief\nbases \\(K_i\\) calculated in the first step, and aggregate them into a\ncollective distance. This is: \\(D(\\omega, E) = D(d(\\omega, K_1)\\),\n\\(d(\\omega, K_2)\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(d(\\omega, K_n))\\). A total pre-order\nover the set W of all interpretations is thus obtained. The\nmerging operator can now select all interpretations that minimize the\ndistance to the profile E.\n\nTechnically, an aggregation function \\(D: R^{+n} \\rightarrow R^{+}\\)\nassigns a nonnegative real number to every n-ary tuple of nonnegative\nreal numbers. For any \\(x_1,\\ldots, x_{n}, x, y \\in R^{+}, D\\)\nsatisfies the following properties:\n\nif \\(x\\ge y\\), then \\(D(x_1,\\ldots , x,\\ldots , x_{n})\\ge\nD(x_1,\\ldots , y,\\ldots , x_{n})\\)\n\\(D(x_1,\\ldots , x,\\ldots , x_{n})=0\\) if and only if \\(x_1=\\ldots\n=x_{n}=0\\) \n\\(D(x)=x\\)\n\n\nThe outcome of the merging operator clearly depends on the chosen\ndistance functions d and D. Among the first proposals\n(Lin and Mendelzon 1999; Revesz 1993) it was to adopt the Hamming\ndistance (defined below) for d and the sum or the\nmax for D (denoted respectively \\(D_{\\Sigma}\\) and\n \\(D_{\\mymax}\\)).[3]\n When D is the sum, the global distance is obtained by summing\nthe individual ones. The corresponding merging operator is a majority\noperator and is called minisum as it will select those\ninterpretations that minimize the sum. The merging operator that uses\n\\(D_{\\mymax}\\) is known as minimax and outputs the judgment\nset that minimizes the maximal distance to the individual bases (Brams\net al. 2007b). Intuitively, minimax aims at minimizing the\ndisagreement with the most dissatisfied individual. Two opposite\noutcomes may be selected when \\(D_{\\Sigma}\\) or \\(D_{\\mymax}\\) is used\n(Brams et al. 2007b; Eckert and Klamler 2007).\n\nThe Hamming distance was a commonly used distance in belief revision.\nThe idea is simple. The Hamming distance counts the number of\npropositional letters on which two interpretations differ. So, for\nexample, if \\(\\omega = (1, 0, 0)\\) and \\(\\omega' = (0, 1, 0)\\), we\nhave that \\(d(\\omega, \\omega') = 2\\) as the two interpretations differ\non the assignment to the first and the second propositions. Also well\nknown is the drastic distance, which assigns distance 0 if\ntwo interpretations are the same and 1 otherwise. But the choice of\nthe distance is not restricted to those options. Other distances can\nbe used, that still satisfy the postulates given above (Konieczny and\nPino P\u00e9rez 1999, 2002). The minimization of the sum of the\nindividual distances is an example of an IC majority merging\noperator. In the next section, we will see this operator applied to\nthe discursive dilemma.\n\nThe distance-based approach can clarify the distinction between\narbitration and majority operators. Leximax is an example of\narbitration operator. A leximax operator may take d as\nthe Hamming distance and, for each interpretation, the distances\nbetween that interpretation and the n bases \\(K_i\\) form a\nlist. A pre-order over interpretations is defined by taking the\nlexicographical order between sequences of distances, fixing an order\nover the set of agents. Finally, \\(D_{\\textit{leximax}}\\) selects the\nminimum. The intuition is that, unlike a majority operator that\nselects the option that minimizes the total disagreement (by\nminimizing the sum of the individual distances, for example), an\narbitration operator looks at the distribution of such\ndisagreement and selects the option that is fairer to all individuals,\nthat is, it aims at equally distributing the individual\ndissatisfaction with the chosen outcome (recall the birthday gift\nexample above). This follows from the definition of the Hamming\ndistance: the larger the Hamming distance, the more disagreement there\nis between two interpretations (here disagreement simply means that\nthe interpretations assign different truth values to the same\nformula). Suppose that a belief profile E has three bases.\nSuppose as well that the distances from the two models of IC\n(\\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega'\\)) are \\(D_{\\Sigma} (\\omega, E) = D_{\\Sigma}\n(\\omega', E) = 6\\) when we take the sum of the Hamming distances, and\n\\(D_{\\textit{leximax}}(\\omega, E)= (2,2,2)\\) and\n\\(D_{\\textit{leximax}}(\\omega', E)= (5,1,0)\\) when we take the\nlexicographic order on the distances. In this example, the majority\noperator cannot distinguish between \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega'\\)\n(because in both cases the sum is 6), while the arbitration operator\nwill prefer \\(\\omega\\) to \\(\\omega'\\) as \\(\\omega\\) distributes the\nindividual disagreement in a fairer way than \\(\\omega'\\).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Liberatore and Schaerf were among the first to\npropose arbitration operators. However, their approach was limited to\nonly two bases, and the result of the merge was one of the two bases.\nSuch operator would give questionable results in some situations, like\nthe one in (Konieczny and Pino P\u00e9rez 2002). Suppose that two\nfinancial experts give you advice regarding four shares a, b,\nc and d. According to the first expert, all four shares\nare going to rise (denoted by \\(\\varphi_1= \\{(1, 1, 1, 1)\\}\\), whereas\nthe second expert deems that all four shares will fall \\((\\varphi_{2}=\n\\{(0, 0, 0, 0)\\})\\). According to Liberatore and Schaerf\u2019s\narbitration operator, the result will be \\(\\{(1, 1, 1, 1), (0, 0, 0,\n0)\\},\\) which means that either the first or the second expert is\ntotally right. If, on the other hand, we apply an arbitration operator\n\u00e0 la Konieczny and Pino P\u00e9rez, we obtain\n\\(\\{(0, 0, 1, 1)\\), \\((0, 1, 0, 1)\\), \\((0, 1, 1, 0)\\), \\((1, 0, 0,\n1)\\), \\((1, 0, 1, 0)\\), \\((1, 1, 0, 0)\\}\\). This result can be\ninterpreted as that\u2014if we assume that all sources are equally\nreliable\u2014we do not have any reason to prefer one or another and,\nso a reasonable position is to conclude that both can be equally\nright. Still, Liberatore and Schaerf\u2019s operator may be used in\nall situations where the result can be only one of the bases submitted\nby the individuals. For example, if two doctors meet in order to\ndecide a patient\u2019s therapy, they likely have to decide in favour\nof one of the two proposals as mixing therapies may not be a feasible\nnor a safe option.\n\nA representation theorem (Konieczny and Pino P\u00e9rez 1999, 2002)\nensures that to each sub-class of IC merging operators\n(majority and arbitration operators) corresponds a family of\npre-orders on interpretations (mirroring a similar representation\ntheorem that Katsuno and Mendelzon (1991) proved for belief revision\n operators).[4]\n\nLet us now illustrate how belief merging can be applied to judgment\naggregation problems.\n3. Belief merging applied to the discursive dilemma\n\nThe merging of individual belief bases into a collective one shares\nsimilarities to the judgment aggregation problem. In both cases, we\nwish to aggregate individual inputs into a group outcome, and both\ndisciplines employ logic to formalize the bases\u2019 contents. As we\nhave seen in\n Section 1,\n no aggregation procedure can ensure a consistent and complete group\njudgment. However, the merging operators introduced in computer\nscience ensure a consistent outcome because such operators do not\nsatisfy independence. The collective judgment on a proposition is not\nonly determined by the individual judgments on that proposition but\nalso by considerations of all other agenda\u2019s items. It\nis natural to apply the results about merging methods to the\naggregation of individual judgments (Pigozzi 2006).\n\nHow do impossibility results in judgment aggregation conciliate with\nthe fact that IC merging operators can ensure a consistent\ncollective outcome? The reason is that merging operators violate the\nindependence conditions, one of the requirements imposed on\naggregation functions in the impossibility theorems. Independence\nturned out to be an instrumentally attractive condition because it\nprotects an aggregation function from strategic manipulation (Dietrich\n2006; Dietrich and List 2007b). This means that an individual has no\ninterest in submitting an insincere judgment set in order to get a\nbetter outcome for her. However, independence has been criticized in\nthe literature as a not suitable desideratum to aggregate\npropositions that are logically interconnected (Chapman 2002; Mongin\n2008). Clearly, paradoxical results are avoided by resorting to\nIC, which blocks unacceptable outcome. However, it is worth\nnoting that in judgment aggregation the collective rationality\ncondition (that requires logically consistent outputs) plays an\nanalogous role as IC in belief merging, that is, blocks\nunacceptable outcomes like inconsistent majority judgments. Moreover,\njudgment aggregation impossibility results persist even if we\nexplicitly import additional integrity constraints into the judgment\naggregation framework (see Dietrich and List 2008b; Grandi 2012).\n\nIt has been observed (Brams et al. 2007a) that majority voting\nminimizes the sum of Hamming distances. This means that, whenever\nproposition-wise majority voting selects a consistent judgment set,\nthe same outcome is selected by the minisum rule. Majority\nvoting has credentials for being democratic. Another reason to focus\non majority distance-based procedures is that the aim of the\naggregation of individual judgments should be the right decision\nrather than a fair distribution of individual dissatisfactions. The\nepistemic link between majority voting and right decisions has been\npointed out in the Condorcet Jury Theorem. The theorem shows\nthat, when the voters are independent and have an equal probability of\nbeing right better than random, then majority rule ensures to select\nthe right decision and the probability for doing so approaches 1 as\nthe voters\u2019 group size increases (see List 2013 for this and\nsome more formal arguments for majority rule).\n\nLet us consider the three judges example and see what we obtain when\napplying the minisum rule. The legal doctrine corresponds to\n\\(\\IC= \\{(p\\land q) \\leftrightarrow r\\}\\). The court is represented by\nthe profile \\(E=\\{K_1 , K_{2} , K_{3}\\}\\), which is the multi-set\ncontaining the judgment sets \\(K_1 , K_{2} , K_3\\) of the three\njudges. The three judgment sets and their corresponding models\nare: \\begin{align} K_1 &= \\{p, q, r\\} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\\n\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mymod(K_1) &= \\{(1, 1, 1)\\};\\\\ K_{2} &= \\{p, \\neg\nq, \\neg r\\} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mymod(K_{2}) &= \\{(1, 0,\n0)\\};\\\\ K_{3} &= \\{\\neg p, q, \\neg r\\} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\\n\\mymod(K_{3}) &= \\{(0, 1, 0)\\}.\\\\ \\end{align}\n\n\nTable 2\n shows the result for the majority operator that minimizes the sum of\nthe Hamming distances. In the first column are all the interpretations\nfor the propositional variables p, q, and r. The\ninterpretations that are not models of the IC have a shaded\nbackground. So, for example, \\((1,0,1)\\) cannot be selected as the\ncollective outcome because it violates the legal doctrine. The numbers\nin the \\(d_H (\\cdot,K_1)\\), \\(d_H(\\cdot,K_{2})\\), and\n\\(d_H(\\cdot,K_{3})\\) columns are the Hamming distances of each \\(K_i\\)\nfrom the corresponding interpretation. In the last column are the sums\nof the Hamming distances.\n\n\n\n\n \\(d_{H}(\\cdot,K_{1})\\) \n \\(d_{H}(\\cdot,K_{2})\\) \n \\(d_{H}(\\cdot,K_{3})\\) \n \\(\\Sigma(d_{H} (\\cdot,E))\\)  \n\n \\((1,1,1)\\) \n 0 \n 2 \n 2 \n 4  \n\n \\((1,1,0)\\) \n 1 \n 1 \n 1 \n 3  \n\n \\((1,0,1)\\) \n 1 \n 3 \n 1 \n 5  \n\n \\((1,0,0)\\) \n 2 \n 2 \n 0 \n 4  \n\n \\((0,1,1)\\) \n 1 \n 1 \n 3 \n 5  \n\n \\((0,1,0)\\) \n 2 \n 0 \n 2 \n 4  \n\n \\((0,0,1)\\) \n 2 \n 2 \n 2 \n 6  \n\n \\((0,0,0)\\) \n 3 \n 1 \n 1 \n 5  \n\n\nTable 2\n\n\nWe see that, without IC, the distance-based majority operator\nwould select the same (inconsistent) outcome as proposition-wise\nmajority voting, that is, \\((1,1,0)\\). This is the outcome that is at\nthe minimum distance from E. However, the merging operator\ncannot select \\((1,1,0)\\) as that outcome violates the IC. Neglecting\nthe shaded rows, only four interpretations are candidates to be\nselected as collective judgment sets, that is, \\((1,1,1)\\),\n\\((1,0,0)\\), \\((0,1,0)\\), and \\((0,0,0)\\). Of those, three are the\nones that minimize the distances. Thus, collective inconsistency is\navoided when a distance-based aggregation is used. However, this\nmethod does not always guarantee a unique outcome. In the court\nexample, this aggregation selects the three models \\((1,1,1)\\),\n\\((1,0,0)\\) and \\((0,1,0)\\) as group positions. Technically, this is\nsaid to be an irresolute procedure, and a tie-breaking rule\nneeds to be combined if we wish to ensure a unique result (as common\nin social choice theory).\n\nThe applicability of merging techniques developed in computer science\nto judgment aggregation problems does not mean that the two\ndisciplines have the same objectives. As we have seen, the original\nmotivation of belief merging was to define ways to aggregate\ninformation coming from different sources. Since the sources can have\ndifferent access to the information, no externally given agenda is\nassumed. This is a difference with the judgment aggregation framework,\nwhere individuals are required to submit their opinion on a given set\nof items. Belief merging and judgment aggregation do not only differ\nin the type of inputs they aggregate. They also output different\nresults: a collective base satisfying some given integrity constraints\nfor belief merging, and a collective judgment on the given agenda for\njudgment aggregation.\n\nAnother difference resides in the fact that judgment aggregation\nassumes that all members are rational, and so they all submit\nconsistent judgment sets. In belief merging, this is not required.\nAgents can submit belief bases that are inconsistent with the\nIC (Gr\u00e9goire 2004). If an individual submits a\njudgment that violates an integrity constraint, that judgment set will\nnot figure among the candidates to represent the group position.\nHowever, his input will not be disregarded and will be taken into\naccount in the merging process. The possibility to abstain from\nexpressing an opinion on a certain item is also easily taken into\naccount in a belief merging setting. If individuals need to have their\nsay on p, q and r and one agent believes q\nand r to be true but does not have a clear opinion on p,\nthis will be represented as \\(\\mymod(K_1)= \\{(1, 1, 1),\\) \\((0, 1,\n1)\\}\\) and the distances calculated accordingly. The completeness\nrequirement on judgment sets has also been weakened in the judgment\naggregation framework. List and Pettit (2002) first discussed the\nweakening of completeness in the context of supermajority and\nunanimity rules. Later, it was shown (G\u00e4rdenfors 2006; Dokow and\nHolzman 2010) that, when judgment sets are not assumed to be complete,\nany independent and unanimous aggregation function turns out to be\nweakly oligarchic, that is, a subset of the individuals will decide\nthe collective outcome. Intuitively, this is a less negative result\nthan dictatorship, though it reduces to dictatorship in the case in\nwhich only one individual belongs to that subset. Dietrich and List\n(2008a) independently obtained equivalent results on oligarchic rules\nto those in (Dokow and Holzman 2010).\n\nFinally, if model-based merging approach is syntax-dependent, judgment\naggregation explicitly permits syntax-dependence. This can give rise\nto decision framing problems (Cariani et al. 2008) or logical agenda\nmanipulation (Dietrich 2006) when a judgment problem can be presented\nusing two logically equivalent but syntactically different\nagendas.\n\nA formal investigation of the relationships between belief merging and\njudgment aggregation can be found in (Everaere et al. 2015, 2017). As\nwe have seen, belief merging takes a profile of propositional belief\nbases as input, where such bases represent the beliefs of a certain\nindividual, not restraint to a given agenda. Judgment aggregation, on\nthe other hand, asks people to submit their judgments on a specific\nset of issues. The analysis rests on the assumption that an\nindividual\u2019s beliefs allow deriving her opinion on the\nagenda\u2019s items. Thus, in (Everaere et al. 2015) a projection\nfunction p (assumed to be identical for all the individuals) is\ndefined. The role of such projection function is precisely to\ndetermine the judgments of an agent (input of judgment aggregation\noperators) starting from her beliefs (input of belief merging). So,\nfor example, if an individual only believes \\(a\\land b\\) and one of\nthe agenda items is a, then the projection function can derive\nthat the person submits a \u201cyes\u201d as judgment on a.\nHowever, if she believes only a and one of the agenda item is\n\\(a\\land b\\), she will probably be not able to submit a judgment on\nthat item. For this reason, individual judgment sets in (Everaere et\nal. 2015) are not necessarily complete (individuals can abstain on\nsome agenda\u2019s issues). Using the projection p, two paths\nalong which a collective judgment can be derived from a profile of\nbelief bases are considered. Along one path (merge-then-project), the\nindividual belief bases are first merged using a merging operator and\nthen the collective judgment is computed by the projection p.\nAlong the other path (project-then-aggregate), starting from the\nindividual bases, the individual judgment sets are first computed by\np and then aggregated using a judgment aggregation procedure to\ndetermine the collective judgment on the given agenda. Thus, the\nquestion addressed is whether the two collective judgments obtained by\nfollowing the two paths coincide. Two cases are considered: the\ngeneral case (incomplete agendas) and the case in which the agenda is\ncomplete (i.e. it contains all possible interpretations). For example,\nthe agenda \\(A= \\{\\neg a \\land \\neg b, \\neg a \\land b, a \\land \\neg b,\na \\land b\\}\\) is complete whereas the agenda \\(A= \\{\\neg a \\land \\neg\nb, \\neg a \\land b, a \\land \\neg b\\}\\) is not. Hence, if an individual\nbelieves \\(a\\land b\\), her judgment set will be \\((0,0,0,1)\\) in the\nfirst agenda and \\((0,0,0)\\) in the second one, which may lead to\ndifferent collective outcomes depending on whether the\nmerge-then-project or the project-then-merge path is used. The fact\nthat by properly choosing the agenda one may manipulate the result has\nbeen investigated in the judgment aggregation literature (Dietrich\n2016, Lang et al. 2016). In the general case, IC merging methods can\ngive results that are inconsistent with those obtained by using\njudgment aggregation operators satisfying unanimity or majority\n preservation[5].\n On a more positive side, when the agenda is complete, the collective\njudgments obtained by following the two paths coincide for some\njudgment aggregation operators satisfying properties closed to some IC\nmerging postulates. \n3.1 Extensions and criticisms\n\nThe minisum rule applied to merge the judgment sets of the\nthree judges in the previous section is based on the same principles\nas the Kemeny rule, a well-known preference aggregation rule\n(Kemeny 1959). Unlike what happened in social choice, at the beginning\nthe literature of judgment aggregation focused on the axiomatic method\nand only few concrete aggregation rules were proposed and studied.\nArguably, the interest of researchers from computer science and\nmulti-agent systems for judgment aggregation lead to the definition of\nmore concrete aggregation rules and to the investigation of their\nrelations. The same idea of minimization that plays such a crucial\nrole in belief merging can be found as a principle in the definition\nof several voting rules in social choice theory. For instance, the\nminisum rule turned out to be equivalent to several other\nrules recently introduced in the judgment aggregation literature (Lang\net al. 2017).\n\nThe interest of computer scientists for aggregation methods is\nwitnessed by the fact that judgment aggregation is now among the\ntopics of computational social choice, an interdisciplinary discipline\nthat promotes exchanges and interactions between computer science and\nsocial choice theory. Computational issues of aggregation rules are\namong the interests of computational social choice. The intuition\nbehind the application of complexity theory to aggregation rules is to\nassess the acceptability of an aggregation rule on the basis of\npragmatic considerations, that is, the algorithmic feasibility of\napplying that rule. So, an aggregation rule is acceptable when its\noutcome is \u2018easy\u2019 to compute, that is, it can be solved by\nan algorithm in time which grows \u2013 at worst \u2013 polynomially with the\nsize of the input (only in some pathological cases we can imagine\ndesiring a rule that will not be able to return an outcome in a\nforeseeable future). On the other hand, if an aggregation rule is\nmanipulable, then it is acceptable when it is \u2018hard\u2019 for\nan individual to manipulate it. Thus, the study of the computational\ncomplexity of aggregation rules may reveal that, even though a rule is\nmanipulable, it is actually hard for an individual to act on that. The\ncomputational complexity of the distance-based procedures has been\nstudied (Endriss et al. 2012; Endriss and de Haan 2015). The high\ncomputational complexity of Hamming rule in judgment aggregation\nmirrors a parallel result that the Kemeny rule in preference\naggregation is also highly computational complex, as first shown in\nBartholdi et al. (1989) and Hudry (1989). A new rule has been proposed\nto overcome the high computational complexity of distance-based\nprocedures. The average-voter rule (Grandi 2012) selects the judgment\nset submitted by the individuals that minimizes the sum of the\ndistances. Hence, the outcome has to be one of the submitted judgment\nsets. This allows reducing the computational complexity and, at the\nsame time, selects the most representative individual.\n\nA generalization of distance-based methods for judgment aggregation\nhas been given in (Miller and Osherson 2009). Besides generalizing (by\ntaking a general metric) the merging operator we have applied to the\ndoctrinal paradox, they proposed three other distance-based procedures\nfor judgment aggregation. In case proposition-wise majority collapses\ninto an inconsistent collective judgment set, one method\n(Endpoint) selects as group outcome the closest (according to\nsome distance metric) consistent collective judgment set. The other\ntwo methods (Full and Output) look at minimal ways\nto change the profile in order to output a consistent proposition-wise\nmajority collective judgment set. The difference is that\nOutput allows the individual judgment sets in the modified\nprofile to be inconsistent.\n\nDuddy and Piggins (2012) questioned the use of Hamming distance\nbetween judgment sets. The problem is that, when the agenda contains\npropositions that are logically connected, the Hamming distance may be\nresponsible of double counting because it ignores such\ninterdependencies. Suppose, for example, that two individuals accept\npropositions q but disagree on \\(p\\land q\\) (so, one individual\naccepts the conjunction, while the other rejects it). This can happen\nonly if they disagree on p. The Hamming distance between the\ntwo judgment sets \\(K_1 = \\{\\neg p, q, \\neg(p\\land q)\\}\\) and \\(K_{2}\n= \\{p, q, (p\\land q)\\}\\) is 2. It is the disagreement on p that\nimplies the disagreement over \\(p\\land q\\), so the distance should be\njust 1. The alternative distance proposed in order to address this\nproblem is a distance that takes the smallest number of logically\ncoherent changes needed to convert one judgment set into the\nother.\n4. Other topics\n\nBelief merging is an abstract theory that addresses the problem of\naggregating symbolic inputs, without specifying whether such items are\nbeliefs, knowledge, desires, norms etc. It is the choice of the\nmerging operator that should best suit the type of inputs. The\nframework of judgment aggregation has also been extended to include\nthe aggregation of other types of attitudes, as in (Dietrich and List\n2010).\n\nThe literature on belief merging includes the study of the strategic\nmanipulation problem (Evaraere et al. 2007). When an aggregation\nprocedure is not strategy-proof, an individual who has a preference\nover the possible outcomes can manipulate the result by lying on her\ntrue beliefs and thus obtain an outcome closer to her true\npreferences. In general, merging operators are not strategy-proof when\nHamming distance is used, whereas they are strategy-proof when the\ndrastic distance is employed. For a recent survey of results on\nstrategic behaviour in judgment aggregation, see (Baumeister et al.\n2017).\n\nIn those situations in which we can assume that there is a fact of the\nmatter (for example, a defendant has\u2014or has not\u2014committed\na murder), which each agent has a (noisy) opinion about, the\ntruth-tracking properties of belief merging operators can be\ninvestigated (Hartmann et al. 2010; Hartmann and Sprenger 2012;\nCevolani 2014). The question is then whether a certain aggregation\nmethod selects the right decision. Williamson (2009) argues that\naggregating the evidence on which the judgments are based is\nbest for judgment aggregation, as it would yield to the right\ndecision. The three-step proposal he advocates distinguishes between\nthree types of propositions: evidence, beliefs and judgments. Evidence\nis the support for an agent\u2019s beliefs and judgments, and it is\nthe right candidate for merging techniques. Judgments, on the other\nhand, are best dealt with decision theory that maps degrees of beliefs\nand utilities to judgments.",
