Klein's Erlangen program\n\n\nIn a booklet issued when he joined the faculty at Erlangen (1872),\nFelix Klein (b.\u00a01849, d.\u00a01925) took stock of the enormous\ngrowth and diversification of geometry and proposed a standpoint from\nwhich its many branches could be organized into a system. From this\nstandpoint, the task of a branch of geometry can be stated thus: \nGiven a manifold and a group of transformations of the\nmanifold, to study the manifold configurations with respect to those\nfeatures which are not altered by the transformations of the group.\n(Klein 1893, p. 67)\n\n\nIn nineteenth-century mathematics, \u2018manifold\u2019 often\ndesignated what we now call a set, but Klein apparently had something\nmore specific in mind: \nIf n variables x1, \u2026 ,\nxn are given, the \u2026 value systems\nwe obtain if we let the variables x independently take the\nreal values from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e constitute what we shall\ncall \u2026 a manifold of n dimensions. Each\nparticular value system (x1, \u2026\n,xn) is called an element of the\nmanifold. (Klein 1873, p. 116)\n\n\nIf S is a manifold in either sense, by a transformation\nof S we mean a one-one mapping of S onto itself. It is\nclear that\n\nIf T1 and T2 are transformations of\nS, the composite mapping \n T2\u2009\u25cb\u2009T1, \n which consists\nof T1 followed by T2, is also a transformation of S;\nthe composition of transformations is associative, so that, if\nT1, T2 and T3 are transformations of\nS,\n (T3\u2009\u25cb\u2009T2)\u2009\u25cb\u2009T1\n = T3\u2009\u25cb\u2009(T2\u2009\u25cb\u2009T1);\nthe identity mapping I that sends each point of S to\nitself is a transformation of S such that, for any\ntransformation T,\n T\u2009\u25cb\u2009I =\n I\u2009\u25cb\u2009T = T;\nfor every transformation T there is a transformation\n T\u22121, the inverse of T, such that\n T\u22121\u2009\u25cb\u2009T\n = I (T\u22121 sends each point of S\nback to where it was brought from by T).\n\n\n\nBy virtue of conditions (i)-(iv), the transformations of S\nform a group GS\u00a0 in\nthe precise sense that this term has in algebra.\nGS\u00a0 includes subgroups, i.e.,\nsubsets which contain I and satisfy conditions (i) and (iv). If H is a\nsubgroup of GS\u00a0 and \u03a6 is a\nfeature of S, or of its elements or parts, which is not\naffected by the transformations of \u03a6, we say that \u03a6 is\nH-invariant. The only GS-invariant\nis the cardinality of S (i.e., the number of elements in the\nmanifold). On the other hand, the group {I}, consisting of the identity\nalone, trivially preserves every conceivable feature. Between these two\nextremes there can be many different subgroups with all sorts of\ninteresting invariants, depending on the respective group structure. If\nS is not an arbitrary (structureless) set, but a numerical\nmanifold as described by Klein, it inherits structure from the real\nnumber field, which contributes to characterize the different subgroups\nof GS\u00a0 and their invariants.\nThus, the group of continuous transformations preserves the topological\nproperties (neighborhood relations), and the group of linear\ntransformations preserves the projective properties. \n\n\nCan metric properties be fixed in this way? Traditionally one\ndefines the distance between two points (x1, \u2026\n,xn) and (y1, \u2026 ,yn) of a\nnumerical manifold as the positive square root of\n(x1\u2009\u2212\u2009y1)\n2 + \u2026 +\n(xn\u2009\u2212\u2009y\nn)2. The group of isometries consists of the\ntransformations that preserve this function. However, this is just a\nconvention, adopted to ensure that the geometry is Euclidean. Using\nprojective geometry, Klein thought of something better. No real-valued\nfunction of point pairs, defined on all projective space, is an\ninvariant of the projective group, but there is a function of collinear\npoint quadruples, called the cross-ratio, which is such an\ninvariant. Drawing on work by Arthur Cayley (b.\u00a01821,\nd.\u00a01895), Klein (1871, 1873) considered the cross-ratio of point\nquadruples\n<P1,P2,P3,P4>. such\nthat P3 and P4 belong to a given conic \u03ba on\na projective plane, while P1 and P2 range over a\nregion\n R\n that is bounded by or\notherwise fixed by \u03ba. Since P3 and P4 must\nbe the points where the straight line through P1 and\nP2 meets \u03ba, the said cross-ratio may be regarded as a\nfunction of the point pair <P1,P2>. The\ncollineations that map a given conic onto itself form a group, and the\nsaid function is clearly an invariant of this group. Klein showed that\na certain function of this function behaves like an ordinary distance\nfunction on\n R.\n According to the nature\nof the conic \u03ba, the structure determined by this function\nsatisfies either (i) all the theorems of Euclidian plane geometry, or\n(ii) all those of Lobachevskian plane geometry, or (iii) those of a\nthird geometry which Klein himself discovered and dubbed\n\u2018elliptic\u2019. (In elliptic geometry every straight line meets\nevery other, and the three internal angles of a triangle always add up\nto more than two right angles. Klein's names for the geometries of\nEuclid and Lobachevsky were \u2018parabolic\u2019 and\n\u2018hyperbolic\u2019, respectively.)\n\n\nThis is how Klein's approach works for Lobachevskian geometry on the\nplane. Let \u03ba be a real conic\u2014a conic comprising only real\npoints\u2014on the projective plane. Let G\u03ba be the\nset of all collineations that map \u03ba onto itself.\nG\u03ba is a subgroup of the projective group. Consider now\nthe cross-ratio of point quadruples\n<P1,P2,P3,P4> such\nthat P3 and P4 belong to \u03ba, while\nP1 and P2 range over the interior Int(\u03ba) of\nthe region of the real plane bounded by \u03ba.\n (P\u00a0\u2208\u00a0Int(\u03ba) if and only if P is a real point\nand no real tangent to \u03ba passes through P.) As noted above, the\nchoice of points P1 and P2 fixes P3\nand P4, so the said cross-ratio may be regarded as a\nfunction of the first pair of points only, say,\nf\u03ba(P1,P2). The function\nf\u03ba is clearly G\u03ba-invariant. Put\nd\u03ba(P1,P2) =\nc\u00a0log\u00a0f\u03ba(P1,P2),\nwhere c is an arbitrary real-valued constant, different from\n0, and log x denotes the principal value of the natural logarithm of x.\nKlein was able to show that d\u03ba behaves precisely like\na Lobachevskian distance function on Int(\u03ba). In other words,\nevery theorem of Lobachevskian geometry holds for suitable figures\nformed from points of Int(\u03ba), if the distance between any two of\nthese points is given by the function d\u03ba. Consider,\nfor instance, four points P1,P2,P3,\nand P4 in Int(\u03ba), such that\nd\u03ba(P1,P2) =\nd\u03ba(P2,P3) =\nd\u03ba(P3,P4) =\nd\u03ba(P4,P1). They are the vertices\nof a Lobachevskian equilateral quadrilateral Q, which can have at most\nthree right angles, in which case the fourth interior angle of Q must\nbe acute. (Where \u2018right angle\u2019 means, as usual, an angle\nequal to its adjacent angle, and two angles in Int(\u03ba) are said to\nbe equal if one is the image of the other by a transformation of group\nG\u03ba).\n\n\nIf \u03ba stands for a different sort of conic, not an ordinary\nreal one, the function d\u03ba obtained by the above\nprocedure behaves on suitably defined regions of the projective plane\nlike a Euclidian distance function or like the distance function of\nelliptic geometry (this depends on the nature of the conic \u03ba).\nThus, depending on whether \u03ba belongs to one or the other of three\nkinds of conic, the group of collineations that map \u03ba onto itself\nis structurally identical with one of the three groups of\nLobachevskian, Euclidean, or elliptic isometries. Similar results hold\nfor the three-dimensional case, with \u03ba a quadric surface.\n\n\nKlein's result led Bertrand Russell (b.\u00a01873, d.\u00a01970) to\nassert, in his neo-Kantian book on the foundations of geometry (1897),\nthat the general \u201cform of externality\u201d is disclosed to\nus a priori in projective geometry, but its metric\nstructure\u2014which can only be Lobachevskian, Euclidean or\nelliptic\u2014must be determined a posteriori by experiment. Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 (b.\u00a01854, d.\u00a01912) took a more radical\nstance: If geometry is nothing but the study of a group,\none may say that the truth of the geometry of Euclid is not\nincompatible with the truth of the geometry of Lobachevsky, for the\nexistence of a group is not incompatible with that of another group.\n(Poincar\u00e9 1887, p. 290)\n\n\nThe application to physics is immediate: \u201cAmong all possible groups\nwe have chosen one in particular, in order to refer to it all physical\nphenomena, just as we choose three coordinate axes in order to refer to\nthem a geometrical figure\u201d (ibid., p. 291). The choice of this\nparticular group is motivated by its mathematical simplicity, but also\nby the fact that \u201cthere exist in nature some remarkable bodies which\nare called solids, and experience tells us that the different\npossible movements of these bodies are related to one another much in\nthe same way as the different operations of the chosen group\u201d (ibid.).\nThese remarks of Poincar\u00e9 signalled the beginning of\nconventionalism in the philosophy of science and provided its initial\nmotivation.\n Klein's group-theoretical view of geometry enjoyed much favor\namong mathematicians and philosophers. It achieved a major success\nwhen Minkowski (1909) showed that the gist of Einstein's special\ntheory of relativity was the (spacetime) geometry of the Lorentz\ngroup, an essential result that Klein (1911) lived to enjoy. It\nimplies that the recent debate on the priority of Minkowski\nchronogeometry over Lorentz invariance or vice-versa is utterly idle,\nfor these are logically equivalent and thus, in effect, two sides of\nthe same coin (as explained by Acu\u00f1a (2016)). However, Klein's\nErlangen program failed to cover the differential geometry of Riemann\n(\u00a75), which Einstein (1915, 1916) placed at the core of his\ngeneral theory of relativity.\n",
