    "main_text": "The Equality of the Sexes || The demand for equality\n4.4 The demand for equality\n\nDesmond Clarke and Jacqueline Broad both emphasize that\nPoulain\u2019s concept of equality is normative in the sense that it\nincludes a demand for equal opportunity. According to Clarke\nwe find in Poulain (and other seventeenth-century feminist authors) a\n\u201cclaim to the effect that all persons should enjoy equal access\nto certain human goods\u201d (2013: 49). This demand is in itself\ndependent on the idea that people are in some relevant respect equal\nand in the case of Poulain we can see that his demand for equal\nopportunity is rooted in his discussions of ability\n (section 4.2)\n as well as his notion of natural equality\n (section 4.3).\n\nBroad points at a passage in De l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9\nwhere Poulain\u2019s demand for equal right is clearly put:\n\u201call of us, men or women, have an equal right to truth since the\nminds of both are equally able to apprehend it\u201d (TTen 91; TTfr\n111). Here the connection between equal right and equal ability is\nexplicit and we can see why it is so urgent for Poulain to show that\nwomen and men have equal minds. The claim that there are no relevant\ndifferences between the minds of women and men is not in itself\nnormative, but provides a basis for demanding the equal right to\nexercise ones mind. As Broad shows, Poulain\u2019s demand for an\nequal right to truth is closely connected to the pursuit of virtue and\nultimately of true happiness, that can be achieved only through virtue\n(Broad 2017: 79; 2019: 32). Poulain writes that \u201c[s]ince the two\nsexes are capable of the same happiness, they have the same right to\neverything that may be used to acquire it\u201d (T1en 169; TTfr\n111).\n\nIt is important to note, as Broad does, that Poulain, following\nDescartes almost word by word, defines virtue as \u201ca firm and\nstable resolve to do what one thinks is best in various\ncircumstances\u201d (T1en 187; TTfr 131; also Descartes\u2019 letter\nto Elisabeth of 4 August 1645, Shapiro [ed.] 2007: 98; AT IV, 265).\nFrom this emphasis on resolve follows that we do not need to assume\nthat the will is always actually able to yoke itself to or dissociate\nitself from the passions (see\n section 4.2):\n it is sufficient to make a resolute attempt in order to be virtuous.\nPoulain\u2019s claim that women and men have an equal ability of\nresolution, an ability he explicitly claims belongs to the mind and\ndepends on the body only as its instrument (T1en 187; TTfr 131), is\nthus valid regardless of whether the sexes are actually able to\nsimilarly govern their passions (even if he holds that the second\nclaim is also true). An equal ability of resolution is in itself\nenough as a basis for the demand that women and men have an equal\nright to knowledge and all other additional means of achieving full\nvirtue and thereby, according to Poulain, happiness. (There is an\nextensive scholarly discussion of exactly how Descartes connects\nvirtue and happiness; for a recent account see Svensson 2019.)\n\nPoulain\u2019s demand for an equal right to knowledge is in effect a\ndemand for an equal right to proper education. When Poulain refers to\neducation, it is most often in order to lament \u201cthe minimal\neducation that women are given\u201d (T1en 196; TTfr 141). In De\nl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 he argues that if we conceive a\nlack of cognitive ability in women, that \u201cshould be attributed\nuniquely to the conditions in which they live and the education they\nare given, which include the ignorance in which they are left\u201d\n(T1en 188; TTfr 132\u2013133; see also G-EMW 59\u201360; G-OC\n971\u2013972). But Poulain\u2019s criticism of the current state of\naffairs includes a demand for change and right at the beginning of the\nfirst conversation in De l\u2019\u00e9ducation,\nStasimachus points out: \u201cas I think it absolutely essential to\nhave an education, I would organize things in such a way that women\ncould get one as easily as men\u201d (TTen 144; TTfr 163). Following\nfrom Poulain\u2019s Cartesian criticism of the Scholastic\ninstitutions of learning, articulated in detail by Stasimachus,\neducation is pictured as a private enterprise and the outline of\nDe l\u2019\u00e9ducation, five conversations set in\nSophia\u2019s private home, can be read as Poulain\u2019s example of\nthe ideal form of education. In this setting equality is emphasized by\nthe fact that we have one learned person of each sex, Stasimachus and\nSophia, and one eager pupil of each sex, Eulalia and Timander (on the roles of the four characters, see Schmitter 2018, 7\u20139).\n\nThe topic of education is also the topic that Poulain most evidently\nshares with many of his predecessors as well as successors. The\nquestion was forcefully raised by Christine de Pizan in Le Livre\nde la Cit\u00e9 des Dames (part I, chap. 27), where she argues\nthat \n\n\nif it were the custom to send little girls to school and to teach them\nall sorts of different subjects there, as one does with little boys,\nthey would grasp and learn the difficulties of all the arts and\nsciences just as easily as the boys do, (Christine 1405 [1999: 57])\n\n\n\nand is still an essential theme in Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s A\nVindication of the Rights of Woman (1792).\n",
