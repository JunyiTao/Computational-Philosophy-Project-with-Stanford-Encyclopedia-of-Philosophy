    "main_text": "Medical Theories || Embryology\n6.1 Embryology\n\nWe would never have known that Philolaus had contributed to medical\ntheory if not for the papyrus known as the Anonymus\nLondinensis, which is in part based on the history of medicine\nwritten in the late fourth century BC by Aristotle\u2019s pupil Meno (DK 44\nA27\u20138; Huffman 1993, 289\u2013306). Philolaus is one of twenty\nthinkers whose views on the causes of disease are presented in the\npapyrus, and the relatively detailed presentation of Philolaus\u2019 views\nsuggests that Meno had access to his book. Philolaus is included among\nthose thinkers who argue that diseases arise from the elements which\nconstitute the body, so that the section on Philolaus begins with his\naccount of the constitution of the human body, which is in effect his\naccount of the nature of the embryo and newborn infant. Philolaus is\nunusual in arguing that the embryo is composed of just one element,\nthe hot, and has no cold in it. The embryo must be hot because both\nsperm and the womb, in which the sperm is deposited, are hot.\nImmediately upon birth, our bodies, which were too hot before, draw in\ncooling breath, which is then sent out again \u201clike a\ndebt.\u201d Thus, respiration suggests that the cool air which is\ndrawn in was originally something foreign to the body, which must be\npaid back to the source from which it is drawn. The limitation of the\nbody\u2019s innate heat by cooling breath may be the process by which the\nbody becomes ensouled (see 5.2 above). There is a clear analogy\nbetween the embryo, constituted solely of the hot, breathing in\ncooling air and the central fire drawing in breath from the unlimited\nin the early stages of Philolaus\u2019 cosmogony (see 4.1).\n\nThe evidence for Philolaus\u2019 embryology discussed above (DK 44\nA27\u201328) does suggest that he, like Anaxagoras, believed that\nonly the male contributed seed and that the female was simply the\nplace in which the seed was sown. Some scholars have gone further and\nargued that Philolaus subscribed to the view that the seed arose from\nthe brain and the spinal marrow and had hot breath in it, which\nconveyed soul to the child (Leitao 2012: 29\u201330). However, this\ninterpretation is based on Diogenes Laertius 8.28, which does not\nmention Philolaus by name and in fact derives from the Pythagorean\nMemoirs excerpted by Alexander Polyhistor. This treatise is\nbelieved by most scholars to belong to the later pseudo-Pythagorean\ntradition and hence is not good evidence for Philolaus\u2019 beliefs\n(Burkert 1972: 53). Moreover, the report contradicts the genuine\nfragments of Philolaus in a number of ways. Fragment 13 of Philolaus\nasserts that semen comes from the genitals not the brain and A27\nclearly suggests that seed is composed just of the hot, says nothing\nof its origin in the brain, and indicates that breath does not enter\nthe child through the male seed but only when it is drawn in upon\nbirth. \n",
