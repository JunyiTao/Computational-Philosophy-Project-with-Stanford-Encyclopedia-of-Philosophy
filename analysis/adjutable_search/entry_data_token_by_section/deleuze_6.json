    "main_text": "Collaboration with Guattari || A Thousand Plateaus\n4.2 A Thousand Plateaus\n\nThree differences between this work and its predecessor are\nimmediately apparent. First, A Thousand Plateaus has a much\nwider range of registers than Anti-Oedipus: cosmic, geologic,\nevolutionary, developmental, ethological, anthropological,\nmythological, historical, economic, political, literary, musical, and\neven more. Second, the results of the paralogisms of\nAnti-Oedipus become \u201cstrata\u201d in A Thousand\nPlateaus: the organism (the unification and totalization of the\nconnective synthesis of production, or the physiological register),\nthe signifying totality or signifiance, which we can perhaps\nrender as \u201csignifier-ness\u201d (the flattening or\n\u201cbi-univocalizing\u201d of the disjunctive synthesis of\nrecording, the semiotic register), and the subject (the reification of\nthe conjunctive synthesis of consummation, the psychological\nregister). Finally, while Anti-Oedipus has a classical\nconceptual architecture, that is, chapters that develop a single\nargument, A Thousand Plateaus is written as a\n\u201crhizome,\u201d that is, as allowing immediate connections\nbetween any of its points. Because of this rhizomatic structure, a\ntraditional summary of the \u201ctheses\u201d and arguments of A\nThousand Plateaus is either downright impossible, or at best,\nwould be much too complex to attempt in an encyclopedia article. We\nwill therefore have to limit ourselves to the following remarks.\n\nIn fourteen plateaus, or planes of intensity\u2014productive\nconnections between immanently arrayed material systems without\nreference to an external governing source\u2014Deleuze and Guattari\ndevelop a new materialism in which a politicized philosophy of\ndifference joins forces with the sciences explored in Difference\nand Repetition. A Thousand Plateaus is a book of strange\nnew questions: \u201cWho Does the Earth Think It Is?,\u201d\n\u201cHow Do You make Yourself a Body Without Organs?,\u201d\n\u201cHow does the war-machine ward off the apparatus of capture of\nthe State?\u201d and so on. To over-simplify, Deleuze and Guattari\ntake up the insights of dynamical systems theory, which explores the\nvarious thresholds at which material systems self-organize (that is,\nreduce their degrees of freedom, as in our previous example of\nconvection currents). Deleuze and Guattari then extend the notion of\nself-organizing material systems\u2014those with no need of\ntranscendent organizing agents such as gods, leaders, capital, or\nsubjects\u2014to the social, linguistic, political-economic, and\npsychological realms. The resultant \u201crhizome\u201d or\nde-centered network that is A Thousand Plateaus provides\nhints for experimentation with the more and more de-regulated flows of\nenergy and matter, ideas and actions\u2014and the attendant attempts\nat binding them\u2014that make up the contemporary world.\n\nA Thousand Plateaus maintains the tripartite ontological\nscheme of all of Deleuze\u2019s work, but, as the title indicates,\nwith geological terms of reference. Deleuze and Guattari call the\nvirtual \u201cthe Earth,\u201d the intensive is called\n\u201cconsistency,\u201d and the actual is called \u201cthe system\nof the strata.\u201d As the latter term indicates, one of the foci of\ntheir investigations is the tendency of some systems to head toward\ncongealment or stratification. More precisely put, any concrete system\nis composed of intensive processes tending toward the (virtual) plane\nof consistency and/or toward (actual) stratification. We can say that\nall that exists is the intensive, tending towards the limits of\nvirtuality and actuality; these last two ontological registers do not\n\u201cexist,\u201d but they do \u201cinsist,\u201d to use one of\nDeleuze\u2019s terms.\n\nNothing ever instantiates the sheer frozen stasis of the actual nor\nthe sheer differential dispersion of the virtual; rather, natural or\nworldly processes are always and only actualizations, that is, they\nare processes of actualization structured by virtual multiplicities\nand heading toward an actual state they never quite attain. More\nprecisely, systems also contain tendencies moving in the other\ndirection, toward virtuality; systems are more or less stable sets of\nprocesses moving in different directions, toward actuality and toward\nvirtuality. In still other words, Deleuze and Guattari are process\nphilosophers; neither the structures of such processes nor their\ncompleted products merit the same ontological status as processes\nthemselves. With this perspective, Deleuze and Guattari offer a\ndetailed and complex \u201copen system\u201d which is\nextraordinarily rich and complex. A useful way into it is to follow\nthe concepts of coding, stratification and territorialization. They\nare related in the following manner. Coding is the process of ordering\nmatter as it is drawn into a body; by contrast, stratification is the\nprocess of creating hierarchal bodies, while territorialization is the\nordering of those bodies in \u201cassemblages,\u201d that is to say,\nan emergent unity joining together heterogeneous bodies in a\n\u201cconsistency.\u201d\n\nThese concepts, and several other networks of concepts considerations\nof space preclude us from considering, are put to work in addressing\nthe following topics. After a discussion of the notion of\n\u201crhizome\u201d in the first chapter (or \u201cplateau\u201d\nas they call it), Deleuze and Guattari quickly dismiss psychoanalysis\nin the second. In the third chapter they discuss the process of\nstratification in physical, organic, and social strata, with special\nattention to questions in population genetics, where speciation can be\nthought to stratify or channel the flow of genes. In chapters 4 and 5\nthey intervene in debates in linguistics in favor of pragmatics, that\nis to say, highlighting the \u201cincorporeal transformations\u201d\n(labels that prompt a different form of action to be applied to a\nbody: \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife\u201d) that socially\nsanctioned \u201corder words\u201d bring about (Deleuze and Guattari\nalso refer to speech act theory in this regard).\n\nThey also lay out the theory of \u201cterritories\u201d or sets of\nenvironmentally embedded triggers of self-organizing processes, and\nthe concomitant processes of deterritorialization (breaking of habits)\nand reterritorialization (formation of habits). Chapters 6 and 7\ndiscuss methods of experimenting with the strata in which we found\nourselves. Chapter 6 deals with the organic stratum or the\n\u201corganism\u201d; the notorious term of art \u201cBody without\nOrgans\u201d can be at least partially glossed as the reservoir of\npotentials for different patterns of bodily affect. Chapter 7 deals\nwith the intersection of signifiance\n(\u201csignifier-ness\u201d) and subjectification in\n\u201cfaciality\u201d; the face arrests the drift of signification\nby tying meaning to the expressive gestures of a subject. Chapters 8\nand 9 deal with the social organizing practices they name\n\u201clines\u201d and \u201csegments\u201d; of particular interest\nhere is their treatment of fascism.\n\nChapter 10 returns to the question of intensive experimentation, now\ndiscussed in terms of \u201cbecoming,\u201d in which (at least) two\nsystems come together to form an emergent system or\n\u201cassemblage.\u201d Chapter 11 discusses the\n\u201crefrain\u201d or rhythm as a means of escaping from and\nforming new territories, or even existing in a process of continual\ndeterritorialization, what they call \u201cconsistency.\u201d\nChapters 12 and 13 discuss the relation of the \u201cwar\nmachine\u201d and the State; the former is a form of social\norganization that fosters creativity (it \u201creterritorializes on\ndeterritorialization itself\u201d), while the latter is an\n\u201capparatus of capture\u201d living vampirically off of labor\n(here Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s basically Marxist perspective is\napparent). Finally, Chapter 14 discusses types of social constitution\nof space, primarily the \u201csmooth\u201d space of war machines and\nthe \u201cstriated\u201d space of States.\n",
