    "main_text": "Psychology\n7. Psychology\n\nKant\u2019s views on psychology are intimately bound up with his more\ngeneral position in the philosophy of mind (see the separate entry on\nthis topic.) He distinguishes between rational and empirical\npsychology and, in the Critique of Pure Reason\u2019s\nParalogisms, denies that rational psychology contains arguments that\ncould justify any substantive principles (especially concerning our\nimmortality). Thus, only empirical psychology, it seems, could be\npossible as a science. However, if Kant continues to maintain that\nscience requires a pure part, and denies that rational psychology\ncontains any substantive knowledge that might constitute the pure part\nof psychology, then it follows that empirical psychology cannot\nqualify as science proper either.\n\nAnd yet, he did not count it as a proper science either. If we ask\nwhy, we can discern two broad answers in the secondary literature.\nOlder interpretations thought it was because mathematization (a mark\nof \u2018proper\u2019 science) is not feasible in psychology.\nSupposedly, it is because psychic phenomena are in time\u2014it is\ntheir ordering structure, or a priori form\u2014and time qua form\nlacks enough features to support strong mathematization. (It is a\n1-dimensional manifold representable as a line: too narrow to support\nconstructions in pure intuition, which mathematization would require.)\nA more recent construal has it that empirical psychology lacks genuine\nlaws. Kant leaves open the prospect for it coming to have \u2018laws\nof association,\u2019 viz. knowledge of patterns of constant\nconjunction between some of our inner representations. Such patterns,\ndiscoverable by introspection, may resemble laws properly so-called.\nBut, as some have argued recently, that is not enough. Genuine laws\nrequire stronger warrant\u2014primarily, evidence from successful\nprediction confirmed by experiment or from precise observations. That\nsort of evidence, interpreters believe, is not available in empirical\npsychology. Which makes it an improper science by Kant\u2019s lights:\neven more improper than chemistry, which arguably does avail itself of\ngenuine laws explicated as above. A scholar who endorses the first\nreading above is Hatfield 1992; for the second, see especially McNulty\n2014.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Kant influenced empirical theory in early 19th-century\nGermany. (However, it was his transcendental psychology in the\nCritique of Pure Reason, not his views on empirical\npsychology, that proved to be most influential.) In particular, his\ndoctrine of space and time as forms of sensibility was given a\nnaturalistic construal in the physiology and psychology of perception.\nSince for Kant an a priori form of intuition need not be innate, it\ncould unfold in the course of sensory experience. This led J.G.\nSteinbuch (1811) and C. Th. Tourtual (1827) to investigate empirically\nhow spatial representation arises\u2014specifically, how particular\nsubjects become able to see things as arrayed in space, perceive\nobjects as three-dimensional, and represent spatial structures more\ngenerally.\n\nHatfield (1990, Chapter 4) surveys these post-Kantian developments in\nmore detail. Kitcher (1990) presents a detailed argument for the role\nof transcendental psychology within Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure\nReason. Sturm (2001) argues that Kant\u2019s critical comments\nabout psychology are primarily directed against introspection-based\nconceptions of psychology.\n",
