    "main_text": "Omnipotence and Unrestricted Repeatability\n3. Omnipotence and Unrestricted Repeatability\n\nOne attempt to analyze omnipotence in terms of unrestricted\nrepeatability is the account of Hoffman and Rosenkrantz. According to\ntheir approach, by identifying certain features of (a)\u2013(f), we\ncan find a feature that none of them possesses, and in terms of which\nan analysis of omnipotence can be stated. To begin, unless it is\npossible for some agent to bring about a given state of\naffairs, an omnipotent agent ought not to be required to be able to\nbring about that state of affairs. But (a) is not possibly brought\nabout by any agent.\n\nNext, while (b) and (c) are possibly brought about by some agent, they\nare not repeatable: it is not possible for either one of them\nto obtain, subsequently fail to obtain, and then obtain again. Note\nthat if, because (a) is not possibly brought about by someone, an\nomnipotent agent is not required to be able to bring about (a), then\nfor the same reason, that agent is also not required to be able to\nbring about impossible or necessary states of affairs. Moreover, if,\nbecause (b) and (c) are not repeatable, an omnipotent agent is not\nrequired to bring about (b) or (c), then for the same reason, that\nagent is also not required to be able to bring about impossible or\nnecessary states of affairs. These reasons for not requiring an\nomnipotent agent to have the power to bring about impossible or\nnecessary states of affairs cohere with our earlier independent\narguments for these restrictions.\n\nThird, while (d) is repeatable, it is not\nunrestrictedly repeatable, that is, it cannot obtain, then\nfail to obtain, then obtain again, and so on, eternally.\n\nFourth, while (e) is unrestrictedly repeatable, it is a\ncomplex state of affairs, namely, a conjunctive\nstate of affairs whose second conjunct is not repeatable.\nThese examples suggest a hypothesis about repeatability and its\nrelation to power, namely, that an omnipotent agent should\nnot be required to have the power to bring about\neither a state of affairs that is not unrestrictedly\nrepeatable, or a conjunctive state of affairs one of whose\nconjuncts is not unrestrictedly repeatable.\n\nLastly, although (f) is unrestrictedly repeatable, (f) is\nanother type of complex state of affairs. In particular, it is\nidentifiable with or analyzable as a conjunctive state of affairs.\nThis state of affairs has three conjuncts, the second of which is not\npossibly brought about by anyone. The conjunctive state of affairs in\nquestion can be informally expressed as follows: Plato decides to\nwrite a dialogue; and there is no antecedent sufficient\ncausal condition of Plato\u2019s deciding to write a dialogue; and\nthere is no concurrent sufficient causal condition of Plato\u2019s\ndeciding to write a dialogue. Because it is impossible for an agent to\nhave power over what is past, the second conjunct of this\nstate of affairs is not possibly brought about by anyone. Thus, an\nomnipotent agent ought not to be required to have the power to bring\nabout a state of affairs that is identifiable with or analyzable as a\nconjunctive state of affairs one of whose conjuncts is not possibly\nbrought about by anyone.\n\nAccording to the account of Hoffman and Rosenkrantz, incoporating\nthese ideas, omnipotence can be analyzed in terms of the following\nthree definitions.\n\n(D1)\n\nThe period of\ntime \\(t\\) is a sufficient interval for \\(s =_{df} s\\)\nis a state of affairs such that: it is possible that \\(s\\)\nobtains at a time-period which has the duration of\n\\(t\\).\n\n\nFor example, any period of time with a duration of 7 seconds is a\nsufficient interval for the state of affairs that a ball rolls for\n7 seconds.\n\n(D2)\nA state of\naffairs, \\(s\\), is unrestrictedly repeatable \\(=_{df}\\)\n\\(s\\) is possibly such that: \\(\\forall n\\exists\nt_1\\exists t_2\\exists t_3 \\ldots \\exists t_n [(t_1 \\lt t_2 \\lt t_3 \\lt\n\\ldots \\lt t_n\\) are periods of time which are sufficient intervals\nfor \\(s \\amp s\\) obtains at \\(t_1 \\amp s\\) doesn\u2019t obtain at\n\\(t_2 \\amp s\\) obtains at \\(t_3 \\amp \\ldots \\amp s\\) obtains at\n\\(t_n)\\) if and only if \\(n\\) is\n odd].[2]\n\n\n\nFor instance, the state of affairs that a ball rolls for 7\nseconds is unrestrictedly repeatable.\n\n(D3)\n\n\\(x\\) is omnipotent at \\(t =_{df} \\forall s\\)(if it is possible for\nsome agent to bring about \\(s\\) then at \\(t\\) \\(x\\) has it within his\npower to bring about \\(s)\\). \n\n\nIn (D3), \\(x\\) ranges over agents, and \\(s\\)\nover states of affairs that satisfy the following\ncondition:\n\n(C)\n(i) \\(s\\)\nis unrestrictedly repeatable, and of the form\n\u2018in \\(n\\) minutes, \\(p\\)\u2019,\n& \\((p\\) is a complex state of affairs \\(\\rightarrow\\) (each of\nthe parts of \\(p\\) is unrestrictedly repeatable &\npossibly brought about by someone)), or (ii) \\(s\\) is\nof the form \u2018\\(q\\) forever after\u2019, where\n\\(q\\) is a state of affairs which satisfies\n (i).[3]\n\n\n\nIn applying (D3) to states of affairs like (e) and (f) it should be\nobserved that a conjunct of a conjunctive state of affairs is\na part of such a complex state of\n affairs.[4]\n (C) (ii) refers to a state of affairs of the form \u2018\\(q\\)\nforever after\u2019, where \\(q\\) is a\nstate of affairs satisfying (i). An example of a state of affairs of\nthis kind is in two minutes, a ball rolls forever after. Two\nsituations in which this state of affairs may obtain are, first, that\nthe ball will start rolling in two minutes, and then continue to roll\nforever after, and second, that the ball will start rolling earlier\nthan that, for instance, two minutes earlier, will be rolling in two\nminutes, and will continue to roll forever after.\n\n\nAs intended, (D3) does not require an omnipotent agent to have the\npower to bring about either impossible or necessary states of affairs,\nor states of affairs such as (a)\u2013(f). Furthermore, (D3) does not\nunduly limit the power of an omnipotent agent, since an agent\u2019s\nbringing about a state of affairs can always be \u201ccashed\nout\u201d in terms of that agent\u2019s bringing about an\nunrestrictedly repeatable state of affairs that it is possible for\nsome agent to bring about. That is, necessarily, for any state of\naffairs, \\(s\\), if an agent, \\(a\\),\nbrings about \\(s\\), then either \\(s\\) is\nan unrestrictedly repeatable state of affairs which it is possible for\nsome agent to bring about, or else \\(a\\) brings about\ns by bringing about \\(q\\), where \\(q\\)\nis an unrestrictedly repeatable state of affairs\nwhich it is possible for some agent to bring about. For instance, an\nomnipotent agent can bring about the state of affairs, that in one\nhour, Parmenides lectures for the first time, by bringing about\nthe state of affairs, that in one hour, Parmenides lectures,\nwhen this lecture is Parmenides\u2019s first. And although the former\nstate of affairs is a nonrepeatable one that (D3) does not\nrequire an omnipotent agent to be able to bring about, the latter\nstate of affairs is an unrestrictedly repeatable state of\naffairs that (D3) does require an omnipotent agent to be able\nto bring about.\n",
