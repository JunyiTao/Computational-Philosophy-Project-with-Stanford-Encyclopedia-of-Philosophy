    "main_text": "Currents || The Ontologicist\n3.1 The Ontologicist\n\nThis current is generally associated with Mario Casalla, Carlos\nCullen, Gunther Rodolfo Kush, and Amelia Podetti. According to these\nthinkers, a Latin American philosophy of liberation has to begin from\nthe ontological situation of the American people, which has a distinct\nrelationship to being. This distinct relationship to being is\nexpressed in the two forms of the verb \u201cto be\u201d in Spanish:\nser (to be) and estar (to be in). Authentic Latin\nAmerican philosophy begins from the estar of the American\npeople in its own being. At the same time, everything that is either\nEuropean or North American has to be rejected as manifestations of a\nphilosophy of oppression and philosophical hegemony. This new\nphilosophy that breaks with the past and everything that is allegedly\nforeign must break with the \u201contological dependence\u201d that\nhas been suffered by Latin American in different ways. This current\nrejects as much European liberalism, as a form of abstract\nindividualism, and Marxism, as a form of economic and inorganic\ncollectivism. It calls for a form of populism that is neither\nnationalistic nor class oriented. Instead, \u201cel\npueblo\u201d is considered as an ontological entity, a community\nof fate, and organic unity that is a pure manifestation of a being-in\nthat assumes distinct cultural characteristics. This\n\u201cpueblo\u201d is not the nation, but the American\nmestizo and Amerindian. It is for this reason that Cerutti\nGuldberg also refers to this current as a manifestation of\n\u201canti-historicist populism\u201d (Cerutti Guldberg\n1988\u20139: 46).\n3.2 The Analectical\n\nThis current is associated with Enrique Dussel and Juan Carlos\nScannone. Like the ontologicist, the analectical also presents itself\nas a critique of both Eurocentrism and North American neo-colonialism.\nIt presents itself as a critique of modernity, conceived as a colonial\nand imperial ideology that has \u201cencubierto\u201d or\nconcealed what is distinctly Latin American. More generally, however,\nthe analectical current articulates itself as a metaphysical critique\nof the thinking of the totality, of all that is thought in terms of\nbeing, the whole that is postulated as the true. At the same time, it\nalso argues that philosophy must \u201cdepart\u201d or\n\u201clocate\u201d itself with reference to both a subject and\nobject of philosophizing. This subject and object is also\n\u201cel pueblo\u201d, or the people.\n\nIn contrast to the ontologicist position, however, the people is not\nunderstood ontologically, but metaphysically, or more precisely\nanalectically, (derived from \u201cana\u201d or beyond, in\ncontrast to \u201cdia\u201d or through and between). This\nstrand of the philosophy of liberation aims to overhaul all of\nphilosophy by subsuming all Western philosophy under the logic of the\nthinking of ontology and the dialectical totality that is always\nself-referential, from Aristotle and Plato, to Hegel, Marx and\nHabermas.\n\nFor philosophers in the analectical current, the authentic people is\nwhat is always outside the totality. Its form of being cannot be\ndetermined once and for all. It is at a given time, as it gives\nexpression to its quest for justice that has left its own legacy and\nmemory of struggle. However, its continuing quest for justice and the\nredress of past sufferings remain undetermined and unaccounted for. If\nfor the ontologicist current the role of the philosopher is to guide\nthe people to recognize its own deep and unsuspected wisdom, for the\nanalectical philosopher the role of philosopher is one that is focused\non being attentive to the clamoring, or \u201cinterpellations\u201d,\nof the people, so that he or she can give voice to their cry for\njustice. That said, it must also be noted that both Dussel and\nScannone have moved beyond many of these ideas, as they were first\nformulated in the early seventies (Dussel 1998, 2007; Scannone 1990).\nTo this extent the analectical denomination may be already\nanachronistic. While Scannone, remaining faithful to his Levinasian\nphilosophical commitments, has turned towards the development of\n\u201cinter-cultural philosophy\u201d, Dussel\u2019s critical\nengagement with Karl-Otto Apel and J\u00fcrgen Habermas has led him to\ndevelop a more dialectical philosophy of liberation, one which has\nmade the linguistic and pragmatic turn (Vallega 2014). Furthermore, in\ndialogue with Walter Mignolo and Santiago Castro-G\u00f3mez, Dussel\nhas been arguing that the philosophy of liberation contributed and is\npart of the \u201cdecolonial turn\u201d in Latin American philosophy\n(see Castro-G\u00f3mez, 2011; Dussel 2015; Mignolo, 2011; Mignol and\nWalsh 2018; Mora\u00f1a, Dussel, J\u00e1uregi, eds. 2008; Allen\nand Mendieta, forthcoming).\n3.3 The Historicist\n\nThis current is associated with the work of Horacio Cerutti Guldberg,\nArturo Roig, Arturo Ardao, and Leopoldo Zea. Like the\n\u201cproblematizing\u201d current (see below), it presents itself\nas a critique of the two prior tendencies. These thinkers argue that\nit is neither possible nor desirable to set out from some absolute\nunsoiled and authentic point of departure. Instead, they argue that we\nare always already immersed in a history of ideas, and the task is\nthus to think the experience of Latin America from out its distinct\nhistory as it has been already thought. Indeed, a lot of the work the\nthinkers in this current have done is to engage in a rigorous\nreconstruction of the history of ideas in Latin America, to see their\nemergence out of unique process of social transformation, and their\ncontinued dialogue and confrontation across the decades and centuries.\nThis history of ideas in Latin America has also been presented as part\nof the project of political emancipation. It is for this reason that\nthe historical antecedents of Latin American philosophy cannot be\ndismissed, for they are also part of a history of the forging of\npolitical freedom in the subcontinent (Zea 1991).\n3.4 The Problematicizing\n\nThis current is associated with the work of Horacio Cerutti Guldberg,\nJos\u00e9 Severino Croatto, Manuel Ignacio Santos, and Gustavo\nOrtiz. Cerutti Guldberg has also argued that Salazar Body and Hugo\nAssmann ought to be considered as contributing to this current. For\nthis group of thinkers, the criteria of philosophy\u2019s efficacy or\nrelevance cannot be authenticity, or how it relates or departs from\nsome \u201cnull\u201d point of enunciation that either responds to\nor is an interpellation of some \u201cmacro\u201d subject. For this\ncurrent, the question is what could constitute a critical reflection,\nwithout fetishes or mystifications, on the demanding crises and\nchallenges of Latin American social reality. Unlike the ontologizing\nand the analectical currents, both the historicizing and the\nproblematicizing reject all ontological or metaphysical attempts to\nfix \u201cel pueblo\u201d or what is properly \u201cLo\nAmericano\u201d, (that is, what properly belong to the\n\u201cAmericas\u201d). Philosophy is caught in the river of history,\nit cannot jump out of, or pretend that a \u201crupture\u201d with\nthe past can be executed or proclaimed. For this group of thinkers,\nthe critical issues were twofold. First, how does philosophy respond\nto a specific set of historical challenges, without falling pray to\nthe ideological prejudices that condition that presentation of that\nvery historical? Second, what is the language that will allow that\nphilosophical reflection to remain ever vigilant?\n\nNotwithstanding these substantive and often time irreconcilable\ndifferences, the philosophy of liberation has been recognized as an\nextremely important and representative philosophical movement that\nsynthesized and responded to distinctly Latin American intellectual\ntraditions and historical challenges. In nearly half a century, other\nfigures have aligned themselves with the movement, even if they were\nnot part of the founding cohort.\n\nThis is the case with Franz Hinkelammert, who was born in Germany in\n1931, and was educated in the Free University in Berlin. In 1963, he\nemigrated to Latin America, first to Chile and then to Costa Rica,\nwhere along with Hugo Assmann, he funded the Departamento\nEcum\u00e9nico de Investigaciones (DEI). His original training was\nin economics, but over the last four decades he has produced a series\nof influential books dealing with the relationship between theology,\neconomics, and philosophy. His work takes up liberation theology, but\nfrom the perspective of political economy and aims to show that the\ntheology of liberation\u2019s critique of religious idolatry are\nmatched by Marxism\u2019s critique of the fetish of the commodity\nform and exploitation. Hinkelammert has also produced a series of\nmonographs aimed at the critique of neoliberalism. Still, what he has\ncontributed is what he calls the Cr\u00edtica de la raz\u00f3n\nut\u00f3pica (Critique of Utopian Reason) (1984), which is\noperative as much in Marxism as it is in liberalism. To counter\nunrealizable utopian projects, Hinkelammert introduced the principle\nof \u201cfactibilidad\u201d or feasibility, as criteria for\nthe evaluation of the ethicalness or morality of any transformative\nmoral-political project.\n\nAnother figure that has contributed to the further refinement of the\nphilosophy of philosophy, mostly through his students, is the Jesuit\ntheologian Ignacio Ellacur\u00eda, born in 1930 in Viscaya, Spain.\nHe was a student of Karl Rahner and Xavier Zubiri. He moved to El\nSalvador, to teach at the Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), where he\nbecame rector in 1969, a position he led until 1989 when he was\nassassinated by paramilitary forces trained by the United States\nmilitary.\n\nEllacur\u00eda worked closely with the Spanish philosopher Zubiri,\nwhose work aimed to overcome the separation between epistemology and\nontology, knower and known, through the notion of what he called\n\u201csentient intelligence\u201d, or \u201cfeeling\nlogos\u201d. Ellacur\u00eda took up Zubiri\u2019s\nontological work and transformed it into a philosophy of history.\nReality is historical and thus it is dynamic. Dynamic historical\nreality is where subjects are formed, but they are also the ones that\nmake historical reality transformative because of their\npraxis, their practical engagement with the world. The\npraxis of human, however, is also always the expansion of the\nhorizon of action. Praxis gives rise to more possibilities\nfor engagement historical reality. The telos of\npraxis is thus greater liberty. His incomplete magnum\nopus Filosof\u00eda de la realidad hist\u00f3rica\n(1991) aimed to develop a philosophy of history that celebrated the\n\u201chistorical intelligence\u201d that is the sediment of praxical\nbeings taking charge of their historical reality that aims at greater\nliberty. It is to be noted that Ellacur\u00eda\u2019s philosophy of\nhistory and \u201cfeeling logos\u201d have been most\neffectively taken up in Dussel\u2019s most recent work on the ethics\nand politics of liberation, which is one reason that, as was noted\nabove, the \u201canalectical\u201d designator may no longer be a\nuseful denomination for a current that has been influenced so\nprofoundly by recent developments in Latin American philosophy (Dussel\n1998, 2007, 2009, 2017, 2018; Bautista 2014; Grant 2020; Mills\n2018).\n4. Themes and Debates\n\nPhilosophical currents have distinct profiles not only because of the\ntheses that define their methods and approaches, but also because of\nthe themes and problems that remain their preoccupations despite\nchanges and the incorporation of new methods and theses. The\nphilosophy of liberation has since its inception taken up the\nfollowing themes.\n\nThe question of populism. At the heart of the philosophy of\nliberation is the problem of the historical subject of liberation.\nThis problem has been addressed in terms of the idea of the\n\u201cpueblo\u201d or people. Yet, this has been defined in\na variety of ways: as an ethnocultural historical formation; as a\nsocio-economic entity; as a cultural entity that transcends both\nnations and classes; as what is to be forged through a democratic\npolitical project. The problem of what or who is the\n\u201cpeople\u201d has taken on a new urgency as new forms of\ndemocratic participation have emerged, and as Latin American nations\nfind themselves more integrated economically and politically due to\nhemispheric transformations. The political transformations of the last\ndecade throughout Latin America, away from revolutionary violence and\ntowards political participation, have been addressed in terms of the\nneed to rethink the issues of political representation and\nparticipation.\n\nThe question of the subject. This problem is the other side\nof the question about the historical subject of liberation. What is\nthe relationship between the individual subject, whether it be\nconceive as an epistemic or ethical agent, and their belonging to a\nmacro-historical subject, where this may be conceived as \u201cel\npueblo\u201d that is either a national-cultural unit, or a\ntransnational, cultural entity, such as the \u201cAmericas\u201d. As\na chapter in phenomenological-hermeneutical philosophy, the philosophy\nliberation has addressed the nature of the particular and distinct\nembodied, free, historically located, and dependent subject. The\nembodied and historical situatedness of the agent is continuously\naddressed from the standpoint of the most deprived and most vulnerable\nin the collective historical subject that is always under\nquestion.\n\n The Question of Gender/Race. As in the liberation of\ntheology, the philosophy of liberation was initially slow to address\nthe questions of both gender and race, although the later was always a\ncentral theme of Latin American philosophy in general. The issue of\nrace was addressed in terms of mestizaje, blanqueamiento\n(whitening, i.e. the idea that through racial mixing Blacks would\nbecome White and thus assimilate into the broader society),\nindigenity, negritude, and racial mixing in general. Mestizaje,\nhowever, has tended to cover up the distinct role that race has played\nin the formation of Latin American identity. The question of gender,\nnonetheless, was explicitly addressed by Enrique Dussel as early as\n1977 in the third volume of his Filosof\u00eda Etica\nLatinoamericana (Dussel 1977), in which he developed an erotics of\nLatin American liberation. In 1980 Dussel published\nLiberaci\u00f3n de la Mujer y Er\u00f3tica Latinoamericana,\nwhich is made up of re-edition of the seventh chapter of this third\nvolume, along with a new text titled \u201cToward a Metaphysics of\nFeminity,\u201d which as the title suggests aims to offer a\nmetaphysical understanding of gender, in which woman is the\n\u201cOther\u201d of man. Dussel\u2019s metaphysics was critiqued\nfor being an anachronistic and \u201cmachista\u201d ontologization\nof Catholic, in particular, and Christian, more generally,\nunderstandings of sex and gender that negated the historical\ncontingency of gender roles that resulted in a recalcitrant rejection\nof sexual difference other than man/woman (Schutte 1993). In the\nepilogue to the 1994 edition of Liberaci\u00f3n de la Mujer y\nEr\u00f3tica Latinoamericana, Dussel, however, rejected and\ncritiqued his earlier views, noting that the Latin American feminism\nof the sixties was primarily oriented towards a critique of North\nAmerican feminism, and that the category of \u201cgender\u201d had\nnot yet being thoroughly absorbed and appropriated within Latin\nAmerican thinking. He also rejected the unintended\n\u201chomophobic\u201d dimension of his earlier call for an\n\u201cErotics\u201d of Latin American liberation. Over the last\nthree decades, in dialogue with Linda Alcoff, Lynda Lange, Maria\nLugones, Ofelia Schutte, and Elina Vuola (Alcoff and Mendieta, eds.\n2000), as well as theologians such as Maria Clara Bingemer,\n\u00a0Ivone Gebara, and Elsa Tamez, philosophers of liberation have\nbegan to address what Lugones has called \u201cthe coloniality of\ngender\u201d (Lugones 2010). \n\nThe question of utopia. As a philosophical movement defined\nby the quest for liberation, the philosophy of liberation has had to\nalways address the question of the role of utopia in energizing\nindividual and social movements. The question of utopia, however, is\nthe problem of the collective imaginary that projects goals that will\nguide transformative movements. Yet, at the same time, such\ntransformative imaginaries are criticized because of their lack of\nfeasibility or operability.\n\nThe question of history. The significance of history is a\nproblematic that threads the entire current and tradition of the\nphilosophy of liberation, not only because \u201cdependency\u201d\nand \u201cliberation\u201d are understood as historical issues, but\nbecause the very project of liberation is to be undertaken from within\nhistory. Indeed, even in its most \u201contological\u201d and\n\u201canalectical\u201d versions, the philosophy of liberation is\nalways addressing the historical character of human existence.\nCollectively, philosophers of liberation affirm that historical\nindexicality of freedom, that is, that human freedom cannot be\nunderstood in the abstract, but only against a very specific\nhistorical conditions that are material because they take the form of\nsocio-political institutions. For philosophers liberation, human\nliberty must be embodied and material precisely because it is part of\na dynamic historical reality.\n\nThe question of democracy and social order. The philosophy of\nliberation was defined as much by its resistance to all forms of\nauthoritarianism as by the persecution that many of its philosophers\nsuffered at the hands of dictators and authoritarian political\nfigures. In its early years question of democracy, legitimacy and\nlegality were subordinate to the metaphysical and ontological\nquestions of the subject of historical emancipation. However, over the\nlast two decades, the political future of Latin American has become a\nmore pressing issue. The quest for national sovereignty and liberation\nfrom Euroamerican imperialism is now framed in terms of ethnoracial\ndemocracies and the greater participation of sectors of the Latin\nAmerican people that were either excluded or entirely ignored during\nthe processes of national independence and national-state formation.\nIn the first decades of the twenty-first century, philosophers of\nliberation think of themselves as contributing to the elaboration of\nwhat has been called \u201cmulticultural\u201d democracy, and in\nthis way, more historically inflected and less\n\u201contological\u201d notions of \u201cel pueblo\u201d\nare being embraced and developed.\n\nTo close, like most vibrant and still alive currents in world\nphilosophy, the philosophy of liberation has been contributing to\nthree key issues that are vital to all philosophy in general, namely:\nthe question of meaning, i.e., how we produce, reproduce and transmit\nhistorically produced meanings across a variety of semiological and\nhermeneutical practices. This is the general question of how humans\ncontinue to communicate across time, even when their basic conditions\nof the production of world-views has radically altered. In tandem, the\nphilosophy of liberation, which began partly as a challenge to a\ncertain historiography of ideas in Latin America, continues to raise\nthe question of how we write the history of philosophy, for whom and\nfor what purposes, in such a way that we surrender to neither\nideological distortions nor na\u00efve purisms, neither Eurocentrism\nnor thirdworldism. Finally, like all transformative and enduring\nphilosophical movements, the philosophy of liberation has since its\ninception articulated itself as a metaphilosophical reflection, i.e.,\nas a philosophy that reflects on its own practice and what merits the\ndignity of being called philosophy tout court (Vallega\n2014).",
