    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n\nJohn Buridan was born sometime before 1300 at or near the town of\nB\u00e9thune in Picardy, France. He was educated in Paris, first at\nthe Coll\u00e8ge Lemoine, where he was awarded a benefice or stipend\nfor needy students, and then at the University of Paris, where he\nreceived his Master of Arts degree and formal license to teach by the\nmid-1320s. He enjoyed a long and illustrious career as an arts master\nat Paris, serving twice (in 1328 and 1340) as university rector and\nsupporting himself with numerous benefices. He last appears alive and\nwell in a document of 1358, which mentions him adjudicating a\nterritorial dispute between the English and Picard nations (the\nParisian student body at the time was organized according to one's\nplace of origin). He must have died shortly thereafter because in 1361,\none of his benefices was awarded to another\n person.[1]\n\n\nSuch is the historical record\u2014a handful of relatively minor\n details.[2]\n Buridan's fame as a teacher and philosopher,\nhowever, quickly turned his life into the stuff of legend. There are\nstories that he met his end when the King of France had him thrown into\nthe Seine River in a sack because of a scandalous affair with the\nQueen, that he went on to found the University of Vienna after being\nexpelled from Paris for his nominalist teachings, and that he even hit\nthe future Pope Clement VI over the head with a shoe while competing\nfor the affections of the wife of a German shoemaker (the blow\napparently created the prodigious memory for which Clement was widely\nknown). But none of these stories can be independently verified, and\nmost are inconsistent with what we do know about\n him.[3]\n Nevertheless, they illustrate what the French scholar Edmond Faral\ncalled the \u201cbruits de ville\u201d or \u2018buzz\u2019\nsurrounding Buridan's name in Parisian circles, which continued for\nsome time after his death (Faral 1950, 16).\n\n\nBuridan's academic career was unusual in two respects, both of which\nhelp to explain his philosophical outlook. First, he appears to have\nspent his entire career in the faculty of arts, without moving on to\nstudy for a doctoral degree in one of the more prestigious faculties\nof law, medicine, or theology, which was the more typical career path of a\nmedieval academic. Most of the figures we think of today as medieval\nphilosophers were in fact trained as theologians, including Thomas\nAquinas, Duns Scotus, and even William of Ockham (though he did not\nfinish his degree). Since university statutes forbade arts masters\nfrom teaching or writing about theology, Buridan produced no\ntheological works and no commentary on the Sentences of Peter\nLombard, the principal genre of philosophical writing in the\nfourteenth century.\n Why did Buridan remain in the faculty of arts? It is unlikely that\nsomeone of his obvious philosophical ability would have gone\nunnoticed. Nor does the reason appear to have been a lack of means,\nfor despite his impoverished background he did receive a number of\nbursaries and stipends, and is even listed in a document of 1349 as\nbeing among those masters capable of supporting themselves without\nfinancial assistance from the University. One possible\nanswer\u2014though in the absence of concrete evidence that he never\nstudied theology, it must remain speculative\u2014is that he\ndeliberately chose to remain among the \u2018artists\n[artistae]\u2019. What little he does say about philosophy\nvery clearly ties the philosophical enterprise to his office as an\narts master, not to whatever it was theologians took themselves to be\ndoing.  Rejecting the traditional picture of theological learning as\nthe perfection or completion of philosophical wisdom, Buridan seems to\narticulate, sometimes in spite of himself, a new vision of philosophy\nas a secular enterprise based on what is evident to the senses and\nintellect, in contrast to theology, which begins from non-evident\ntruths revealed in scripture and\ndoctrine.[4]\nPerhaps most tellingly, Buridan never refers to theology as\nconstituting a \u2018scientia\u2019, or body of\nknowledge\u2014an assumption almost all theologians took great pains\nto defend in their commentaries on the \nSentences.[5]\n\n\nBuridan is also different in that he remained for his entire life a\nsecular cleric rather than joining a religious order such as the\nDominicans or Franciscans. A papal letter of 1329 refers to him as\nsimply, \u201cclericus Atrebatensis diocoesis, magister in\nartibus [a cleric from the Diocese of Arras and Master of\n Arts]\u201d (Faral 1950, 11).\n By contrast, the best-known names of the period all had religious\nand intellectual affiliations beyond the university: Thomas Aquinas\n(Dominican), Duns Scotus (Franciscan), William of Ockham (Franciscan),\nGregory of Rimini (Augustinian), to name a few. The benefit for\nBuridan was that it freed him from the obligation to enter into the\ndoctrinal disputes that had begun to arise, with alarming frequency\nand intensity, between religious orders, or between an order and the\nchurch hierarchy\u2014e.g., the dispute between the papacy and the\nFranciscans over apostolic poverty. Thus, whereas Ockham spent his\nentire later career on political crusades, away from philosophy, and\nwas finally excommunicated for his troubles, Buridan was bound only by\nthe intellectual and pedagogical traditions of his university. His\nconfessional independence also meant that he could help himself to\nphilosophical insights from a variety of sources. This occasionally emerges in the\neclectic character of his work, as we shall see below.\n",
