Philosophy of Developmental Biology\n\nThe debates over adaptationism in the 1980\u2019s made philosophers\nfamiliar with the complex interactions between explanations of traits\nin evolutionary biology and explanations of the same traits in\ndevelopmental biology. Developmental biology throws light on the kinds\nof variation that are likely to be available for selection, posing the\nquestion of how far the results of evolution can be understood in\nterms of the options that were available (\u201cdevelopmental\nconstraints\u201d) rather than the natural selection of those options\n(Maynard Smith, Burian et al. 1985). The debate over\ndevelopmental constraints looked at developmental biology solely from\nthe perspective of whether it could provide answers to evolutionary\nquestions. However, as Ron Amundson pointed out, developmental\nbiologists are addressing questions of their own, and, he argued, a\ndifferent concept of constraint is needed to address those questions\n(Amundson 1994). The emergence in the 1990\u2019s of a new field\npromising to unite both kinds of explanation, evolutionary\ndevelopmental biology, has given rise to a substantial philosophical\nliterature aimed at characterizing this field from a methodological\nviewpoint (Gray 1992; Griffiths and Gray 1994; Oyama 2000a, 2000b;\nOyama, Griffiths, and Gray 2001; Maienschein and Laubichler 2004;\nRobert 2004; Amundson 2005; Brandon and Sansom 2007). For example,\ndevelopmental systems theorists (Gray 1992; Griffiths and Gray 1994;\nOyama 2000a, 2000b; Oyama, Griffiths, and Gray 2001) argue for\n\u201cparity\u201d between genes and non-genetic factors. First,\norganisms inherit a \u201cdevelopmental matrix\u201d and not just\ngenes (e.g. \u201cepigenetic inheritance\u201d). Second, the role of\ngenes is in the development of traits is not causally unique \u2013\ninsofar as genes \u201ccarry information\u201d or are\n\u201ccopied\u201d the same can be said of other factors. That is,\ngenes and developmental factors causally covary with phenotypic\ntraits. However, defenders of \u201cextended replicators\u201d argue\nthat genes uniquely carry information in a teleosemantic sense\n(Sterelny et. al. 1996). Another source of philosophical controversy\nin developmental biology concerns whether any traits are innate and\nwhat innateness might be (Ariew 1999; Griffiths 2002; Mameli and\nBateson 2006). Philosophers have contributed to clarifying the\ndifference concepts at issue. \n",
