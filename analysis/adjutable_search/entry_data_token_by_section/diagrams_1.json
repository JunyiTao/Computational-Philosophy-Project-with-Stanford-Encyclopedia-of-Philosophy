Diagrams as Representational Systems\n\nThe dominance of sentential representation systems in the history of\nmodern logic has obscured several important facts about diagrammatic\nsystems. One of them is that several well-known diagrammatic systems\nwere available as a heuristic tool before the era of modern logic.\nEuler circles, Venn diagrams, and Lewis Carroll\u2019s squares have\nbeen widely used for certain types of syllogistic reasoning (Euler\n 1768;\n Venn\n 1881;\n Carroll\n 1896).\n Another interesting, but neglected, story is that a founder of modern\nsymbolic logic, Charles Peirce, not only revised Venn diagrams but\nalso invented a graphical system, Existential Graphs, which has been\nproven to be equivalent to a predicate language (Peirce\n 1933;\n Roberts\n 1973;\n Zeman\n 1964).\n\nThese existing diagrams have inspired those researchers who have\nrecently drawn our attention to multi-modal representation. Logicians\nwho participate in the project have explored the subject in two\ndistinct ways. First, their interest has focused exclusively on\nexternally-drawn representation systems, as opposed to internal mental\nrepresentations. Second, their aim has been to establish the logical\nstatus of a system, rather than to explain its heuristic power, by\ntesting the correctness and the expressive power of selective\nrepresentation systems. If a system fails to justify its soundness or\nif its expressive power is too limited, a logician\u2019s interest in\nthat language will fade (Sowa\n 1984;\n Shin\n 1994).\n\nIn this section, we examine the historical development of Euler and\nVenn diagrams as a case study to illustrate the following aspects:\nFirst, this process will show us how one mathematician\u2019s simple\nintuition about diagramming syllogistic reasoning has gradually been\ndeveloped into a formal representation system. Second, we will observe\ndifferent emphases given to different stages of extension and\nmodification of a diagrammatic system. Thirdly and relatedly, this\nhistorical development illustrates an interesting tension and\ntrade-off between the expressive power and visual clarity of\ndiagrammatic systems. Most importantly, the reader will witness\nlogicians tackle the issue of whether there is any intrinsic reason\nthat sentential systems, but not diagrammatic systems, could provide\nus with rigorous proofs, and their success in answering this question\nin the negative.\n\nHence, the reader will not be surprised by the following conclusion\ndrawn by Barwise and Etchemendy, the first logicians to launch an\ninquiry into diagrammatic proofs in logic,\n\nthere is no principled distinction between inference formalisms that\nuse text and those that use diagrams. One can have rigorous, logically\nsound (and complete) formal systems based on diagrams. (Barwise &\nEtchemendy\n 1995:\n 214)\n\n\nThis conviction was necessary for the birth of their innovative\ncomputer program Hyperproof, which adopts both first-order\nlanguages and diagrams (in a multi-modal system) to teach\nelementary logic courses (Barwise & Etchemendy\n 1993\n and Barwise & Etchemendy\n 1994).\n",
