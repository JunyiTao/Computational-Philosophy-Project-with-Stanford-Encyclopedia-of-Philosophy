    "main_text": "Interpretive Issues || Relativized Real Essences\n4.1 Relativized Real Essences\n\nThere are two main interpretations of real essences in the literature:\nthe relativized real essence thesis, according to which a real essence\njust is whatever microstructure causes the nominally essential\nqualities of the object; and (for lack of a better name) the\nunrelativized real essence thesis, whereby the real essences consist\nof the total microstructure of the substance, not just the features\ncausally responsible for the nominal essence. Textual evidence for the\nrelativized real essence thesis comes from III.vi.6:\n\n\nBy this real Essence, I mean, that real constitution of any\nThing, which is the foundation of all those Properties, that are\ncombined in, and are constantly found to co-exist with the nominal\nEssence; that particular constitution, which every Thing has\nwithin it self, without any relation to any thing without it. But\nEssence, even in this sense, relates to a Sort, and\nsupposes a Species: For being that real Constitution, on\nwhich the Properties depend, it necessarily supposes a sort of Things,\nProperties belonging only to Species, and not to\nIndividuals\u2026Here are Essences and Properties,\nbut all upon supposition of a Sort, or general abstract Idea,\nwhich is considered as immutable: but there is no individual parcel of\nMatter, to which any of these Qualities are so annexed, as to be\nessential to it, or inseparable from it. That which is\nessential, belongs to it as a Condition, whereby it is of\nthis or that Sort: But take away the consideration of its being ranked\nunder the name of some abstract Idea, and then there is\nnothing necessary to it, nothing inseparable from it.\n [4]\n\n\nSome Locke scholars take this to imply that the real essence is always\nrelativized to the nominal essence for Locke. If properties belong\nonly to species\u2014not to individuals\u2014and real essences are\ndefined as the real constitution of a thing that is the foundation of\nits properties, then it seems to follow that the real essence of a\nthing is defined in relation to the species to which the thing\nbelongs; essences relate to a sort (III.vi.4).\n\nCritics of the relativized real essence interpretation of the\nEssay will point out that if real essences are only for\nsorted substances, then Locke ought to consistently use the term\n\u2018real essence\u2019 whenever referring to the submicroscopic\nstructure of sorted individuals. However, in II.xxiii.37 Locke uses\n\u2018internal constitution,\u2019 not \u2018real essence\u2019 to\nrefer to the causal ground of the nominally essential qualities of\ngold:\n\n\n\u2026the greatest part of the Ideas, that make our complex\nIdea of Gold, are Yellowness, great Weight,\nDuctility, Fusibility, and Solubility, in Aqua Regia,\netc. all united together in an unknown Substratum;\nall which Ideas, are nothing else, but so many relations to\nother Substances; and are not really in the Gold, considered barely in\nit self, though they depend on those real, and primary Qualities of\nits internal constitution, whereby it has a fitness, differently to\noperate, and be operated on by several other Substances.\n\n\nThese powers he lists are nominally essential properties of gold, but\nsince Locke refers to their causal ground as an \u2018internal\nconstitution\u2019 and not as a \u2018real essence,\u2019 one might\nargue, it seems that \u2018real essence\u2019 is not uniquely\nemployed to designate the submicroscopic foundation of the powers\nincluded within the nominal essence.\n\nMoreover, critics of the relativized real essence interpretation will\nlikely focus on the part of (III.vi.6) that seems to bracket off all\nnominally essential qualities from a real essence: \u201cBy this\nreal Essence, I mean, that real constitution of any\nThing\u2026which every Thing has within it self, without any\nrelation to any thing without it.\u201d That is, one might argue that\nif we can consider a real essence all by itself, independently of any\nrelations to other objects or observers, then real essences are not\nrelativized to nominal essences because we can consider a real essence\nwithout reference to \u201cany relation to anything without it\u201d\nand nominally essential qualities require relations to observers.\n\nThere are important issues here that a consistent and plausible\ninterpretation of Locke on real essences must take into account. How\none does so will impact what one may say with respect to the\npossibility of real essences for individual objects in Locke.\n",
