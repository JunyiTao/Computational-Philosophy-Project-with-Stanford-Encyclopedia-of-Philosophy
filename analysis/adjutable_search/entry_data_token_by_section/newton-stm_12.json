    "main_text": "Common Impediments to Understanding the Scholium || Why They Are Indeed Impediments\n6.2 Why They Are Indeed Impediments\n\n It will be more illuminating to respond to these in reverse order.\n\n\n (Ad 4) It is an artifact of Motte's translation that the Latin verb\ndefiniri (passive infinitive) is rendered occasionally as\n\u2018be determined\u2019 rather than as \u2018be\ndefined\u2019. According to seventeenth-century English usage, either\nchoice is acceptable. In appropriate contexts, the two function as\nsynonyms, as in the Euclidean axiom, \u201cTwo points determine a line.\u201d\nMotte's practice conforms with this. The conclusion of the argument\nfrom effects, \u2018definiri\u2019 is translated as \u2018be\ndefined\u2019:\n And therefore this endeavor does not\ndepend upon any translation of the water in respect of the ambient\nbodies, nor can true circular motion be defined by such\ntranslation.\n [Paragraph XII]\n \n\n If one now goes back and substitutes \u2018be defined\u2019 for\n\u2018be determined\u2019 into the conclusions from the arguments\nfrom properties quoted above, they take on, to the modern ear, a\ndifferent meaning. They make claims as to what constitutes an adequate\ndefinition of the concepts of true, or absolute, motion and rest.\n\n\n (Ad 3) We have already seen how\n paragraph XIII\n signals the conclusion,\nnot just of the arguments from properties, causes, and effects, but\nthe direct arguments for absolute time and absolute space as well,\nwhich, altogether, Newton takes establish the ontological distinction\nbetween the absolute and the relative quantities. That the next\nparagraph, in which the globes are introduced, concerns a different,\nepistemological issue would be apparent were it not for another\nartifact of the Motte translation, this time involving the Latin verb\n\u2018distinguere\u2019. Newton uses the word again and again,\nalmost thematically, in characterizing and arguing for the ontological\ndistinction between the absolute and the relative quantities; and\nMotte renders it in English as \u2018to\ndistinguish\u2019. Unfortunately, the English verb appears in the\nMotte translation one more time at the start of the final paragraph:\n It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover,\nand effectually to distinguish, the true motions of particular bodies\nfrom the apparent; \n\n But in the Latin, the word \u2018distinguere\u2019 is nowhere to be\nfound. Rather, the sentence reads:\n Motus quidem veros corporum singulorum cognoscere, &\nab apparentibus actu discriminare, difficillimum est;\n\n\n Thus, to the Latin reader, it is clear that Newton is moving on to a\ndifferent consideration.  \n\n (Ad 2) What has been said in connection with (4) suffices against the\nfalse expectations developed in (2). However, there may remain some\nsense that, even on a proper reading, Newton tried to bluff his way\npast the principle of Galilean relativity. Newton indeed acknowledges\nthe principle, though not by name, in Corollary V to the laws of\nmotion:\n The motions of bodies in a given [relative] space\nare the same among themselves whether that space is at rest or moves\nuniformly in a straight line without uniform motion.  \n\n And there is no reason to think that he did not appreciate the\nlimitation it poses for experimentally differentiating between\nabsolute rest and uniform motion in a straight line. A particular\ninstance of Corollary V is the solar system as a whole. Assuming the\nabsence of external forces, it follows (from Corollary IV to the laws)\nthat the center of gravity of the solar system is either at rest or\nmoves uniformly in a straight line. But which? Because of Corollary V,\nwhen Newton wishes to attribute a definite state of motion to the\ncenter of mass of the solar system in Book III, he must introduce the\n hypothesis that \u201cThe center of the system of the world is at\nrest.\u201d Should this not be some source of embarrassment?  \n\n Apparently not. Immediately following the hypothesis, he writes:\n This is conceded by everyone, although some contend it is\nthe earth, others the sun, that is at rest in the center. Let us see\nwhat follows from this.  \n\n According to Newton, the attribution of a state of absolute rest to\none or the other of these bodies is universally taken for\ngranted. What does confound all conventional wisdom in what follows is\nthat neither the earth nor the sun is at rest, but rather the\ncenter of gravity of the solar system.  \n\n (Ad 1) Although arguing that absolute space and absolute time are\ndistinct from any relative spaces and relative times involves, in each\ncase, arguing for the existence of an additional entity, it does not\nfollow that, in arguing that absolute motion is distinct from relative\nmotion, Newton is obliged to argue yet another existence\nclaim. Unfortunately, the term \u2018absolute motion\u2019 is prone\nto be read in two distinct ways. On one reading, it means, as a matter\nof stipulative definition, \u2018change of absolute place\u2019. In\nthis sense of \u2018absolute motion\u2019, the existence of absolute\nmotion (or more precisely, the possibility of the existence of\nabsolute motion) follows immediately from the existence of absolute\nspace and absolute time.  As indicated before, nothing further needs\nto be said.  On the other reading, \u2018absolute motion\u2019 is\nsynonymous with \u2018true motion\u2019. And as we have just seen,\nNewton finds no reason to doubt that his audience does not grant that\na body is either truly at rest or truly in motion. The venerable\ntradition that takes motion and rest to be contraries has yet to be\nquestioned. So it is not incumbent on Newton make a case for the\nreality of absolute motion in the sense of true motion. What is\nincumbent is for him to argue that true motion just is change of\nabsolute place.  And that is the purpose of the arguments from\nproperties, causes, and effects.  \n",
