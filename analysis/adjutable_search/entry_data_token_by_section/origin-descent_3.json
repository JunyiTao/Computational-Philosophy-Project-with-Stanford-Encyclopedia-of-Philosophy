    "main_text": "The Reception of the Origin || The Popular Reception of Darwin\u2019s Theory\n3.1 The Popular Reception of Darwin\u2019s Theory\n\nThe broad sweep of Darwin\u2019s claims, the brevity of the empirical\nevidence actually supplied in the text, and the implications of his\ntheory for several more general philosophical and theological issues,\nimmediately opened up a controversy over Darwinian evolution that has\nwaxed and waned over more than 150 years. As is well-known, Darwin\ndeveloped his argument rhetorically with the claims of its explanatory\nsuperiority over the doctrine of \u201cspecial creation\u201d, which\nhe posed as the main alternative to his account. This stylized\nopposition to \u201ccreationism\u201d, rather than to the arguments\nraised by the traditions of Cuvier, Buffon, and Lyell that\ndemonstratively formed the basis of the scientific opposition to\ntransformism before Darwin (see the entry on\n evolutionary thought before Darwin),\n was a point of considerable criticism by contemporaries such as\nRichard Owen, who held no such theory of special creationism (Bowler\n2013a). But the rhetorical strategy of opposing his theory to theistic\ncreationism served to define much of the popular debate over\nDarwin\u2019s theory in the succeeding period, and continues to\ndefine it in the present.\n\nOn the level of popular culture, Darwin\u2019s theory fell into a\ncomplex social situation that took on different features in different\nnational traditions. In the anglophone world, the great popularity of\nthe anonymous Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation of\n1844, which had reached 11 editions and sold 23,350 copies by December\nof 1860 (Secord \u201cIntroduction\u201d to Chambers 1844 reprint\n[1994: xxvii]), with several more editions to appear by the end of the\ncentury, certainly prepared the groundwork for the general notion of\nthe evolutionary origins of species by natural law. The\nVestiges\u2019s grand schema of a teleological development\nof life from the earliest beginnings of the solar system in a gaseous\nnebula to the emergence of humanity under the action of a great\n\u201claw of development\u201d, had also been popularized for\nVictorian readers by Alfred Lord Tennyson\u2019s epic poem In\nMemoriam (1850). This provided a context in which some could read\nDarwin as supplying additional support for the belief in an optimistic\nhistorical development of life under teleological guidance with the\npromise of ultimate historical redemption. Such readings also rendered\nthe Origin seemingly compatible with the progressive\nevolutionism of Herbert Spencer (1820\u20131903; see the entry on\n Herbert Spencer).\n Spencer\u2019s writings have been shown to be an important vehicle\nby which Darwin\u2019s views, modified to fit the progressivist views\nexpounded by Spencer, were first introduced in non-Western contexts\n(Jin 2019a,b; Yang 2013; Lightman [ed.] 2015; Pusey 1983; Elshakry\n2013) Most of this popular reception ignored or revised Darwin\u2019s\nconcept of evolution by natural selection to fit these progressivist\nalternatives (Bowler 1983). The popular image often depicted of a\ngreat public outcry against Darwin\u2019s work has been shown by\ncareful historical analysis to be generally mythical, or at least in\nneed of careful discrimination by social group, national tradition,\nand religious affiliation (Bowler 2013a; Elleg\u00e5rd 1958).\n\nAnalysis of the various European receptions of Darwin\u2019s work\ncurrently forms a scholarly industry in its own right (Bowler 2013a;\nGayon 2013; Glick 1974 [1988], 2013; Glick & Shaffer 2014; Engels\n& Glick 2008; Gliboff 2008; Numbers 1998; Pancaldi, 1983 [1991];\nTodes 1989; Kelly 1981; Hull 1973). Studies of non-Western receptions\nis a newer area in Darwin studies. These display similar patterns, but\nalso important differences, from the reception in European contexts\n(Jin 2019a,b; Yang 2013; Shen 2016; Elshakry 2013; Glick 1988\n\u201cPreface\u201d; Pusey 1983). These studies continue to display\na common pattern in which the general reception of Darwin\u2019s\ntheories was conditioned, if not determined, by the pre-existing\nintellectual, scientific, social, and political contexts into which\nDarwin\u2019s theories were inserted.\n\nThree examples\u2014France, Germany, and China\u2014can be\nelaborated upon. In France, Darwin\u2019s theory was received against\nthe background of the prior debates over transformism of the 1830s\nthat pitted the theories of Lamarck and Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire\nagainst Cuvier (Gayon 2013; entry on\n evolutionary thought before Darwin,\n 4.1). At least within official Parisian science, these debates had\nbeen resolved in favor of Cuvier\u2019s anti-transformism. Darwin\nwas, as a consequence, viewed as endorsing rejected science by leading\nfigures of French science. As the leading physiologist and\nmethodologist of French Science, Claude Bernard (1813\u201378) put\nthis in 1865, Darwin\u2019s theory was to be regarded with those of\n\u201ca Goethe, an Oken, a Carus, a Geoffroy Saint Hilaire\u201d,\nlocating it within speculative philosophy of nature rather than\ngranting it the status of \u201cpositive\u201d science (Bernard\n1865: 158\u2013159 [1957: 91\u201392]). The intellectual framework\nprovided by the \u201cpositive philosophy\u201d of Auguste Comte\n(1798\u20131857) also worked both for and against Darwin. On one\nhand, Comte\u2019s emphasis on the historical progress of science\nover superstition and metaphysics allowed Darwin to be summoned in\nsupport of a theory of the progress of science. The Origin\nwas so interpreted in the preface to the first French translation of\nthe Origin made by Cl\u00e9mence Royer (Harvey 2008). On\nthe other hand, the Comtean three stages view of history, with its\nclaim about the historical transcendence of speculative and\nmetaphysical periods of science by a final period of experimental\nscience governed by determinate laws, placed Darwinism in a\nmetaphysical phase of speculative nature philosophy, as captured in\nthe above quotation from Claude Bernard.\n\nIn the Germanies, Darwin\u2019s work entered a complex social,\nintellectual and political situation in the wake of the failed efforts\nto establish liberal democracy in 1848. It also entered an\nintellectual culture strongly influenced by the pre-existent\nphilosophical traditions of Kant, of Schelling\u2019s\nNaturphilosophie, German Romanticism, and the Idealism of\nFichte and Hegel (R.J. Richards 2002, 2008, 2013; Gliboff 2008, 2007;\nMullen 1964). These factors formed a complex political and\nphilosophical environment into which Darwin\u2019s developmental view\nof nature and theory of the transformation of species was quickly\nassimilated, if also altered. Many readings of Darwin consequently\ninterpreted his arguments against a background of Schelling\u2019s\nphilosophy of nature. Darwin\u2019s role in debates over scientific\nmaterialism were also brought to the fore by the enthusiastic advocacy\nof Darwinism in Germany by University of Jena professor of zoology\nErnst Heinrich Haeckel (1834\u20131919). More than any other\nindividual, Haeckel made Darwinismus a major player in the\npolarized political and religious disputes of Bismarckian Germany\n(R.J. Richards 2008). Through his polemical writings, such as the\nNatural History of Creation (1868), Anthropogeny\n(1874), and Riddle of the Universe (1895\u201399), Haeckel\nadvocated a materialist monism in the name of Darwin, and used this as\na stick with which to beat traditional religion. Much of the\nhistorical conflict between religious communities and evolutionary\nbiology can be traced back to Haeckel\u2019s polemical writings,\nwhich went through numerous editions and translations, including\nseveral English and American editions that appeared into the early\ndecades of the twentieth century.\n\nTo turn to a very different context, that of China, Darwin\u2019s\nworks entered Chinese discussions by a curious route. The initial\ndiscussions of Darwinian theory were generated by the translation of\nThomas Henry Huxley\u2019s 1893 Romanes Lecture \u201cEvolution and\nEthics\u201d by\nthe naval science scholar Yan Fu (1854\u20131921) who had encountered Darwinism while  being educated at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich from 1877 to 1899.  This translation was  accompanied by Huxley\u2019s\n\u201cProlegomena\u201d, and was accompanied  with an extensive\ncommentary by Yan Fu drawing heavily upon the writings of Herbert\nSpencer. This translation, published under the name of Tianyan\nLun in 1898, has been shown to have been the main vehicle by\nwhich the Chinese learned of Darwin\u2019s work (Jin 2019a,b; Yang\n2013; Pusey 1983). Beginning in 1902 with a partial translation by Ma\nJunwu (1881\u20131940), a Chinese scientist, trained in chemistry and metallurgy in\nJapan and Germany, the early chapters of the Origin itself\nwere made available to a Chinese audience. This initial translation of the first five chapters between 1902 and 1906  by\nMa Junwu modified the text to agree with the progressive evolutionism\nof Spencer and with Yan Fu\u2019s popular Tianyan Lun. Only\nin September of 1920 did the Chinese have Ma Junwu\u2019s full\ntranslation of Darwin\u2019s sixth edition. This gave a more faithful\nrendering of Darwin\u2019s text, including an accurate translation of\nDarwin\u2019s final views on natural selection (Jin 2019a,b). As a\npolitical reformer and close associate of democratic reformer Sun\nYat-Sen (1866\u20131925), Junwu\u2019s concern with Darwin also was\ninvolved in revolutionary Chinese politics (Jin 2019a).\n",
