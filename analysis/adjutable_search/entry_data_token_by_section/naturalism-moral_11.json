Cornell Realism\n\nIf moral naturalism is the view that moral facts are the kinds of\nfacts that can be investigated in a broadly scientific way, then no\nview captures the spirit of naturalism better than Cornell realism.\nCornell realism was developed in the 1980s by Richard Boyd (1988),\nDavid Brink (1986), Nicholas Sturgeon (1985), and Peter Railton\n(1986a; 1986b); the view gets its name from the fact that Boyd, Brink,\nand Sturgeon were working or studying at Cornell University at the\ntime. It is a comprehensive metaethical system, with interrelated\nlinguistic, metaphysical, and epistemological commitments, that\ndeliberately mirrors scientific methodology in ethics as closely as\npossible.\n\nIt might seem odd to suggest that we can know things about morality by\nusing scientific methodology. Scientific methods are all, ultimately,\ngrounded in an epistemology of observation. And as Gilbert Harman\n(1977, Ch. 1) famously argued, it does not seem that we can observe\nmoral facts in anything like the same way that we can observe other\nkinds of natural facts. It\u2019s rather obvious how we can have\nempirical knowledge of natural properties such as redness or\nroundness; they are directly observable. But goodness doesn\u2019t\nseem to be directly observable, and that looks like an important\ndisanalogy between moral properties and natural properties.\n\nBut not all natural properties are directly observable. Some kinds of\nnatural properties are complex, and knowable only through the\nfunctional role they occupy. Consider, for instance, the property of\nbeing healthy. Being healthy isn\u2019t like being red; there\u2019s\nno one way that healthy people look. Of course, there may be some\ncharacteristic visual signs of healthiness \u2013 rosy cheeks, a\nspring in one\u2019s step \u2013 but these visual signs are neither\nnecessary nor sufficient for healthiness. These directly observable\nproperties are only indications of healthiness. Healthiness is a\ncomplex natural property, wholly constituted by an organism\u2019s\nbody being in the \u201cproper\u201d configuration, with a robust\ncausal profile. There are many things that can cause or impede health\nby their presence or absence: food, water, disease, etc. And there are\nmany things that will result from health in typical circumstances:\nenergy, long life, etc. Rosy cheeks and a spring in one\u2019s step\nare indications of healthiness because these are properties that are\n\u2013 typically \u2013 caused by health. Our awareness of the\ncausal profile of healthiness thus gives us a way of figuring out\nwhich things have or do not have the complex property of\nhealthiness.\n\nCornell realists hold that goodness is exactly like healthiness in all\nof these ways (Boyd 1988). Like healthiness, goodness is a complex\nnatural property that is not directly observable, but nonetheless has\na robust causal profile. Like \u201chealthiness,\u201d\n\u201cgoodness\u201d is not synonymous with any simpler empirical\ndescription. Instead, \u201cgoodness\u201d describes the\nfunctionally complex natural property that is the effect of certain\ncharacteristic causes, and the cause of certain characteristic\neffects. Many different things contribute to or detract from goodness\n\u2013 things like pleasure or pain, honesty or untruthfulness\n\u2013 and there are many things that will result from goodness in\ntypical circumstances \u2013 things like human flourishing, or\npolitical peace. Because goodness is a natural property with a complex\ncausal profile, the property of goodness can enter into explanatory\nrelations. Thus, contra Harman, it is possible for goodness to explain\nour observations (Sturgeon 1985). We can, accordingly, observe whether\nsomething is good by looking for indications of goodness. This is\nexactly the same way that we observe whether something is healthy.\n\nAnother way that goodness is like healthiness is that both are\nmultiply realizable. We could, perhaps, give a more or less complete\ndescription of what it takes for a human body to be healthy, although\nsuch a description might be quite long and complicated. But it\u2019s\nalso possible that aliens with a very different biology exist, and for\nthose aliens to be healthy, even though a healthy alien body is\nnothing like a healthy human body. But despite their radical physical\ndifferences, both a healthy alien and a healthy human are healthy. The\nsame might be true of goodness, or other moral properties. As a\nnatural property, any particular instance of goodness is fully\nconstituted by a complex of more fundamental physical properties. But\ngoodness might be constituted by an indefinitely large number of\nradically distinct physical configurations: the goodness of a promise\nkept is quite different from the goodness of a delicious and\nnutritious meal. This motivates the Cornell realists to call\nthemselves non-reductive naturalists (by which they mean that they are\none-term naturalists rather than descriptivists). Goodness is\nrealizable in too many physical structures to give a usable definition\nof morality in descriptive terms.\n\nThe great asset of Cornell realism is that it directly adopts widely\naccepted views about the nature of natural properties and scientific\nknowledge in order to answer the foundational questions of moral\nmetaphysics and moral epistemology. What are moral properties? Highly\ncomplex natural properties, multiply realizable in more fundamental\nstructures, and individuated by their causal profiles. Are there,\ngenerally, properties like this? Yes; these are known as\n\u201chomeostatic cluster properties.\u201d Healthiness is one;\nmoral properties are properties like that. How do we know about moral\nproperties? By looking for directly observable properties that are\ncharacteristically functionally upstream or downstream from the moral\nproperty that we are interested in (provided that we have justified\nbackground beliefs about the functional roles of moral properties). Do\nwe, generally, have knowledge like this? Yes: this is how we have\nscientific knowledge; moral knowledge is knowledge like that. In this\nway, the theoretical resources of scientific realism also turn out to\nsupport moral realism (Boyd 1988).\n\nA skeptic might object that it\u2019s impossible to have justified\nbackground beliefs about the functional profile of moral properties.\nBut this objection would prove too much. We are entitled to rely on\nbackground beliefs in moral theory development because we\u2019re\nentitled to do so in science, generally (Boyd 1988, 189\u2013191).\nOur theories and background beliefs are justified together, by their\noverall coherence and empirical adequacy, in both science and\nethics.\n\nIt is not essential to Cornell realism that goodness be identified\nwith any particular complex natural property \u2013 different Cornell\nrealists have different first-order normative commitments. The most\ninfluential of these accounts is due to Railton (1986a; 1986b).\nRailton, like Thomson, holds that moral goodness is defined in terms\nof what is non-morally good for agents. Whereas Thomson, as a\nneo-Aristotelian, defines what is good for a human in terms of human\nbiology, Railton defines non-moral goodness for an agent as what a\nfully-informed counterpart would advise us to desire, or, (perhaps)\nequivalently, what a fully-informed counterpart of ourselves would\ndesire if they were in our actual position (see also Brandt 1979;\nSmith 1994). To illustrate, Railton asks us to imagine a traveler,\nLonnie, who feels terrible because he is badly dehydrated. Lonnie does\nnot know that he is dehydrated, and so is not taking appropriate steps\nto make himself feel better. But imagine a fully-informed version of\nLonnie \u2013 \u201cLonnie-Plus\u201d \u2013 who knows about his\ndehydration and knows that drinking clear liquids will make him feel\nbetter. Lonnie-Plus, who (like Lonnie) desires to feel better but who\n(unlike Lonnie) knows the best means to that end, would recommend that\nLonnie drink clear fluids, and would drink clear fluids himself if he\nwere in Lonnie\u2019s position. The fact that Lonnie-Plus would\nadvise Lonnie to want to to drink clear fluids means that drinking\nclear fluids is good for Lonnie. This is not a relativist view of\ngoodness, because the fact that Lonnie-Plus would choose to drink\nclear liquids is determined by Lonnie\u2019s circumstances and\nconstitution, and facts about Lonnie\u2019s circumstances and\nconstitution are objective facts. In general: the complex natural\nproperty of being good for an agent is identical to the complex\nnatural property that agent\u2019s fully-informed counterpart would\nchoose. This makes goodness \u201cobjective, though relational\u201d\n(Railton 1986b, 167).\n\nThis account is highly controversial. Railton\u2019s case of\nLonnie-Plus presents a counterpart who knows just a few more salient\nbits of information than Lonnie. But a counterpart who is truly\nfully-informed will know vastly more than we\nourselves do, and would, accordingly, be quite different from us. A\nfully-informed counterpart might be suicidally depressed, or made\nneurotic by their full awareness of all the oddities and dangers in\nthe world, or might in some other way have been driven quite mad by\nthe process of becoming omniscient. It\u2019s far from clear what a\nfully informed person would desire, and, given that fully-informed\nindividuals are so radically different from ourselves, it\u2019s not\nclear why we should think that the advice of such an agent would have\nanything to do with our own personal well-being (Loeb 1995). It might\nalso be impossible to be fully-informed in this way. It\u2019s\nplausible that our knowledge affects the nature of our experiences,\nand so a \u201cfully-informed\u201d agent would be incapable of\nknowing what it is like to have experiences in a condition of\nignorance, and thus could not be truly fully informed (Sobel 1994;\nRosati 1995). We might also worry that full information accounts get\nthings backwards; advice attends to our interests, our interests\ndon\u2019t attend to advice, even ideal advice (see Risberg 2018 and\ncitations therein). Railton heads off this objection by denying that\npersonal good depends on an ideal advisor\u2019s advice:\n\u201cthe existence of an individual\u2019s objective interest can\nexplain why his ideally informed self would pick out for his\nless-informed self a given objectified subjective interest, but not\nvice versa\u201d (Railton 1986b, fn 17). This answers the\nworry, but leaves us somewhat adrift. If the advice of a\nfully-informed counterpart doesn\u2019t make a certain complex of\nnatural properties count as good for an agent, what does?\n\nWith this account of personal, non-moral goodness in hand, Railton\nthen defines a moral standard as a standard that takes all\nagents\u2019 interests equally into account. To act rightly is to act\nin accordance with this standard. Railton\u2019s moral standard is\n\u201cconsequentialist, aggregative, and maximizing, [but it] is not\nequivalent to classical utilitarianism,\u201d since Railton does not\nassume that personal, non-moral goodness consists in happiness\n(Railton 1986, fn. 31). This moral standard has explanatory power; for\ninstance, if a society does not take the interests of all into\naccount, it might be more prone to revolution, and so a revolution in\nan immoral society might be explained by that immorality. Because the\nmoral standard is one that takes the interests of all into account,\nthe right thing for an agent to do may fail to serve her interests.\nAssuming that practical reasons are grounded solely in self-interest\n(as Railton does), people who don\u2019t care about the moral\nstandard might have no reason to act morally. As we saw in Section\n4.2, Railton accepts a \u201creforming definition\u201d of morality\nthat sacrifices the intrinsic normativity of moral standards. As we\nalso saw in Section 4.2, many consider this to be an unacceptable\nconsequence of the view.\n\nThere may, in practice, be substantial overlap between the\nmetaphysical commitments of neo-Aristotelianism and Cornell realism.\nCornell realists say that the good is a certain higher-order natural\nproperty. Neo-Aristotelians say that goodness has something to do with\nhuman flourishing, which is also a higher-order natural property. Both\nCornell realists (Boyd) and neo-Aristotelians (Thomson) have found the\nanalogy with healthiness illuminating when explaining the nature of\nmoral properties (see also Bloomfield 2001). So Cornell realists and\nneo-Aristotelians do tend to be similar in the way that they conceive\nof normative properties. But they differ with respect to what they say\nabout language.\n\nWhile neo-Aristotelians favor an attributive semantics for\n\u2018good,\u2019 Cornell realists accept causal regulation\nsemantics for moral terms, which is the view that moral terms refer to\nwhatever property causally regulates their use. Adopting causal\nregulation semantics is a sensible thing for the Cornell realists to\ndo, for two reasons. First, it continues their foundational commitment\nto treating moral properties as natural properties that we know and\ntalk about in the same way that we know and talk about other natural\nproperties. Causal regulation semantics are the standard semantic\naccount for natural kind terms. And second, it helps them evade the\nOpen Question Argument (Brink 2001). According to causal regulation\nsemantics, moral terms cannot be defined in any verbal way. They\nsimply refer to the (complex higher-order natural) property that\ncausally regulates their use. This makes Cornell realism a form of\nsynthetic naturalism. As we saw in 1.2, Moore\u2019s Open Question\nArgument shows, at most, that analytic descriptivism is false.\n\nBut the Cornell realist\u2019s semantics is also the source of the\nmost influential objection to Cornell realism. According to this\nobjection \u2013 Horgan and Timmons\u2019s Moral Twin Earth\nObjection (Horgan and Timmons 1991) \u2013 we do not use moral terms\nin the way that the Cornell realist predicts. To understand the Moral\nTwin Earth Objection, we need to first understand how causal\nregulation semantics are supposed to work. The following thought\nexperiment, from Putnam (1975), has been highly influential: Imagine a\nworld \u2013 Twin Earth \u2013 where there is no H2O, but\nthere is another substance called XYZ. This substance XYZ, while\ndistinct from H2O, fills the rivers and lakes, is clear and\ntasteless, etc. XYZ even has the property of being called\n\u2018water\u2019 \u2013 when residents of Twin Earth fill up a\nglass with XYZ from the tap, they will say \u201cI have a cup of\nwater.\u201d Yet for all this, we would not say that Twin Earth is a\nplanet where water is XYZ. We would say that this is a planet where\nthere is no water. There is, instead, another substance \u2013 XYZ\n\u2013 that plays the same functional role. Yet when the person on\nTwin Earth fills a cup from the tap and declares \u201cI have a cup\nof water\u201d, we shouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re mistaken. What\ncould account for that? Putnam argues that the word\n\u2018water\u2019 just means something different on Twin Earth than\nit does in the actual world. In the actual world, \u2018water\u2019\nmeans H2O because, in the actual world, H2O is\nthe stuff that causally regulates our use of the term\n\u2018water.\u2019 But on Twin Earth, \u2018water\u2019 means XYZ\nbecause, on Twin Earth, it is XYZ that causally regulates Twin\nEarthlings use of the term \u2018water.\u2019 That is why the word\n\u2018water\u2019 literally means something different on Twin Earth\nthan it does on Earth.\n\nAccording to the Moral Twin Earth Objection, things don\u2019t work\nthis way for moral terms. Imagine a world \u2013 Moral Twin Earth\n\u2013 that is exactly like the actual world, except on Moral Twin\nEarth, people\u2019s use of moral terminology is causally regulated\nby different properties from those in the actual world. People use\nmoral terminology to praise and blame and to guide action, but they\ntake different kinds of actions to be worthy of praise or blame and\nthey guide their actions in different ways. Thus, if causal regulation\nsemantics is true for moral terms, the word \u2018right\u2019\nliterally means something different on Moral Twin Earth than it does\nin the real world \u2013 this is the intuition that drives\nPutnam\u2019s original Twin Earth case. But we do not have the same\njudgment about how people use moral language on Moral Twin Earth! If\npeople on Moral Twin Earth take different actions to be worthy of\npraise or blame, we don\u2019t conclude that our words\n\u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019 mean different things. We\nconclude that there is a substantive moral disagreement between the\ndenizens of Moral Twin Earth and the people in our world, and that\nsuch disagreement is possible only because we and the Twin Earthers\nmean the same thing by our moral terms. Horgan and Timmons argue that\nthis proves that moral terms like \u2018right\u2019 and\n\u2018wrong\u2019 do not refer to whatever it is that causally\nregulates their use. So much the worse for Cornell realism. See Copp\n(2000), Dowell (2016), Dunaway and McPherson (2016), and V\u00e4yrynen\n(2018) for recent criticisms of this argument. Wisdom (2021)\ncriticizes the whole debate on the grounds that our intuitions about\nTwin Earth and Moral Twin Earth are not stable enough to draw any\nmeaningful conclusions one way or the other.\n\nThe deep problem here is that causal regulation semantics implies a\nkind of relativism. Indeed, some relativists, like Prinz (2007) and\nWong (2006), have argued that their view follows from the Cornell\nrealists\u2019 empirical methodology and moral semantics. If words\nrefer to whatever causally regulates their use, and the same word is\nregulated by different things in different communities, then that word\nrefers to different things in different communities. So if\n\u2018wrong\u2019 refers to whatever causally regulates its use, and\nif two communities have a word \u2018wrong\u2019 that is causally\nregulated by different things, then \u2018wrong\u2019 means\ndifferent things in those communities. This saddles Cornell realists\nwith a classical problem for relativism. If \u2018wrong\u2019 just\nmeans something like \u2018whatever my community disapproves\nof,\u2019 as the relativist says, then \u201cMy community\ndisapproves of this act, but they shouldn\u2019t, because\nthere\u2019s nothing wrong with it at all\u201d is\nself-contradictory. But that\u2019s not self-contradictory; so much\nthe worse for relativism (see, e.g., Schroeder 2010, Ch 1). Similarly,\nif words refer to whatever causally regulates their use within a\ncommunity, then \u201cThis action regulates the use of the term\n\u2018wrong\u2019 in my community, but it shouldn\u2019t, since\nthere\u2019s nothing wrong about that action\u201d would be\nself-contradictory. But that\u2019s not self-contradictory; so much\nthe worse for Cornell realism (Sinhababu 2019).\n\nOne might think that Cornell realists can respond by offering a new\naccount of moral language. But this response faces difficulties on two\nfronts. First, causal regulation semantics is the Cornell\nrealists\u2019 way of avoiding a commitment to analytic naturalism\nand the accompanying Open Question Argument. If the causal reference\ntheory is false for moral terms, the naturalist may be forced to\naccept a theory of moral semantics that would re-introduce the Open\nQuestion Argument. Second, the causal reference theory for moral\nlanguage is essential to the Cornell realists\u2019 methodological\nand epistemological commitments. If moral goodness is the thing that\nregulates our use of moral terminology, then the terms of our\nempirical investigation are simple: we just investigate what regulates\nthe use of our moral language. But if the moral facts are not\n(necessarily) the facts that regulate the use of our moral language,\nthen we need a new methodology for moral investigation.\n\nBecause of this, the Moral Twin Earth objection is often presented as\na kind of extension of Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument. The Open\nQuestion Argument is, in Moore\u2019s formulation, an attack on the\nidea that there can be analytic natural-normative property identity\nclaims. But in a larger sense, the Open Question Argument picks out a\nkind of epistemic shortcoming for moral naturalists. Moral naturalists\nare committed to the idea that moral facts are a kind of natural fact\n\u2013 but which natural facts are the moral facts? More simply, how\ndo we know good from bad? If moral claims are synonymous with certain\nnatural claims, we can know by conceptual analysis which things are\ngood. And if moral facts are the facts that causally regulate our use\nof moral terminology, that provides us with another way of\ninvestigating which facts are the moral facts. But if neither of those\nstories is available, it seems that we have no way of identifying\nwhich natural facts are the moral ones (Huemer 2005, chapter 4; Bedke\n2012). This would be a serious methodological problem for moral\nnaturalists, and would also mark a critical disanalogy between moral\nepistemology and scientific epistemology. This disanalogy would be\ncrippling to Cornell realists, who hold that there is no such\ndisanalogy.\n",
