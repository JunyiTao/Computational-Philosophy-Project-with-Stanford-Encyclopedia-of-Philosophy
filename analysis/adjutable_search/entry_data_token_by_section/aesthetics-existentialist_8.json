    "main_text": "The audience\n9. The audience\n\n\nAn essential ambiguity characterises\nalso the experience of the audience. On the one hand, the genuine\nartist creates a new virtual world that expresses a coherent,\nidiosyncratic perspective on the world shared by all. When the audience\nmeets the artwork successfully, the spectators suddenly change their\nown mode of perception and have to adopt a new perspective. To use a\nlinguistic metaphor, the tired, instituted language of everyday\ncommunication (\u2018spoken\u2019 or sedimented language) is\nrejuvenated by a \u2018speaking\u2019 language, a true expression\nthat imposes itself on the audience (be it the reader or the\nspectator). Therefore, the artwork, in a sense, creates its own\naudience (Merleau-Ponty 1964b, 86, and also 12-13; see also Dufrenne,\n1973, 63\u201371).\n\n\nNevertheless there is also an active side to artistic enjoyment, as\nin reading, for example. Without the spectator\u2019s contemplation,\nor the reader\u2019s reading, the artwork\u2019s expression remains\npurely subjective. It becomes objective, manifesting its sense in\nactuality, only through the symbolic consumption of the audience. This\nact, however, is not passive: it mobilises the audience\u2019s own\npower of expression and imagination. Reading, watching, or listening\nare, as Sartre puts it, \u201cdirected creations\u201d: \u201cTo\nwrite is to make an appeal to the readers that they lead into objective\nexistence the revelation which I (the artist) have undertaken by means\nof language\u201d (Sartre 1948a, 32; Dufrenne 1973, 47\u201360).\nMarcel\u2019s conception of the theatre as an experience of\n\u2018communion\u2019 also implies this active participation of the\naudience.\n\n\nThe ambiguity of aesthetic experience is linked directly to the\nabove mentioned theory of the negativity of the expressive means. The\nwork of art functions when it is able to define a coherent perspective\nonto the world, yet this perspective is mainly defined in the negative,\nas the trace of iterable and consistent attitudes in the world.\nTherefore, the spectator is required to translate the traces, caesuras\nand elisions that negatively defined the new world of expression into\npositive traits: \u201c\u2026 the imagination of the\nspectator has not only a regulative function but a constitutive one. It\ndoes not play: it is called upon to recompose the beautiful object\nbeyond the traces left by the artist\u201d (Sartre 1948a, 33).\n\n\nA metaphor Sartre and Merleau-Ponty employ frequently is that of the\ntwo sides of the artwork, comparable to the two sides of a mirror. The\nartist only sees his or her own work from the inside; he or she\nlives the artwork in a sense, since the expressive power is\nrooted in an idiosyncratic form of being-in-the-world. For the work to\nbecome an objective entity with a manifest meaning, the understanding\nand imagination of the audience needs to reconstruct the meaningful\nsilence in between the traces. And this understanding cannot be\npassive, since the truly expressive meaning involves a new form of\nbeing-in-the-world. The spectator or reader is called upon to\neffectuate the same original mode of being-in-the-world: \u201cIf he\nis a writer, that is, if he knows how to find the ellipses, elisions\nand caesuras of conduct, the reader will respond to his appeal and meet\nhim at the centre of the imaginary world he animates and rules\u201d\n(Merleau-Ponty 1964b, 89). Once again, a key feature of aesthetic\nexperience is communication, the \u2018echo\u2019 that a subjective\nattitude to the world finds in others.\n",
