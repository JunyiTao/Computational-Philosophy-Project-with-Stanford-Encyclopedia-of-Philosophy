    "main_text": "Paradigmatic Relational Situations || Reductive Realism without Polyadic Properties\n4.1 Reductive Realism without Polyadic Properties\n\n\nAs mentioned above, on the simplest or most ontologically\nparsimonious form of realism without polyadic properties, what we are\ncalling \u2018reductive realism\u2019, paradigmatic relations are\nidentified with ordinary, non-relational monadic properties or\naccidents. Now we might expect this form of realism to appeal to\nanyone committed to realism without polyadic properties. After all,\nfailure to reduce such relations to such accidents threatens to make\nthem mysterious. If paradigmatic relations are monadic properties, but\nnot ordinary, non-relational accidents, then how are we to understand\nthem?\n\n\nConsiderations of intelligibility certainly play a role in the debate\nbetween medieval reductive and non-reductive realists. As we shall\nsee, non-reductive realists typically recognize that the chief\ndifficulty for their view lies in specifying the precise nature of the\nsui generis monadic properties to which they appeal. More often\nthan not, however, reductive realists object to non-reductivists on\ngrounds of theoretical parsimony. This is certainly true in the case\nof Abelard and Ockham, whom we earlier identified as reductive\nrealists. In the case of Abelard, such considerations are not\nexplicitly formulated, though they are part-and-parcel of his general\napproach to metaphysics and philosophy of\n language.[18]\n In the case of Ockham, by contrast, the appeal to parsimony is much\nmore explicit, often taking the form of what has come to be known as\nOckham\u2019s razor: \u201cPlurality should not be assumed without\n necessity\u201d (Ordinatio I, d. 30, q. 2 in Opera\nTheologica iv, 322).\n\n\nAnother consideration that plays an important role in the debate\nbetween reductive and non-reductive realists has to do with the proper\ninterpretation of authoritative texts. Since medieval philosophers\ndevelop their theories of relations in the course of reflecting on\nAristotle\u2019s Categories, they often present their views as the\none actually suggested (or even required) by the text itself. Abelard,\nfor example, suggests that his reductive theory is a direct\nconsequence of Aristotle\u2019s second definition of relations. Thus, when\nAristotle characterizes relations in Categories 7 as\n\u201cthose things for which this is their very being: being toward\nsomething in a certain way,\u201d Abelard argues that this should be\ninterpreted to mean that relations are items that make other\nthings to be relatives. Just as certain attributes (say, being\nred, juicy, and sweet) make their subjects good, so too, he suggests,\ncertain accidents (such as being-six-feet-tall and five-feet-ten)\nrelate their subjects (See Logica\n\u2018ingredientibus\u2019, 216\u201317. For further discussion, see\nBrower 1998).\n\n\nTextual considerations and direct appeals to Aristotle\u2019s\nauthority play a much bigger role in early medieval debates than they\ndo in the high and later Middle Ages, when literal commentary was no\nlonger the dominant form of philosophical literature. Nonetheless,\nthese sorts of considerations continue to be important throughout the\nMiddle Ages. Even Ockham, in his Summa logicae, addresses the\nissue of whether Aristotle should be interpreted as holding some form\nof non-reductive realism:\n\n\nThere are many theologians of this opinion, and at one time even I\nbelieved it to have been Aristotle\u2019s opinion. Now, however, it seems\nto me that the contrary opinion follows from his principles. (Summa\nlogicae I, c. 49 in Opera Philosophica i, 154. Cf.\nHenninger 1989, 120.)\n\n\n\n\nOne final argument used by reductive realists to motivate their\nposition is worth mentioning here. This argument has to do with the\nnature of relational change. Almost all medievals accept the\nintuitively plausible view that things can acquire (and lose)\nrelations without undergoing any real (as opposed to merely Cambridge)\nchange.  Thus, Socrates can come to be shorter than Simmias solely in\nvirtue of a change in Simmias\u2019s\n height.[19]\n As reductive realists such as Ockham often point out, this fact about\nrelational change admits of a ready explanation on their position,\nsince Socrates\u2019s relation is nothing over and above\nSimmias\u2019s and Socrates\u2019s heights, the latter of which\nnever changes. By contrast, the same fact appears to pose a serious\nchallenge for the non-reductive realist. For if Socrates\u2019s\nrelation is something distinct from Simmias\u2019s and\nSocrates\u2019s heights, then apparently Socrates must acquire\nsomething new when Simmias\u2019s height increases. But then,\ncontrary to the original intuition, the non-reductive realist must say\nthat Socrates undergoes a real change after all.\n\n\nThese considerations are not the only ones that reductive realists\nappeal to, but they are among the most important for understanding\ntheir position, and we shall rely on them in what follows to motivate\nand clarify the alternative position of the non-reductive\n realists.[20]\n\n\nBefore leaving the topic of reductive realism, we need to take account\nof a slight complication. In our discussion to this point, we have been\nspeaking as if reductive realists always intend to identify individual\nparadigmatic relations such as tallness or shortness with pairs of\nmonadic properties taken jointly. We have done this because,\nat least initially, this seems to be the most natural way to\nunderstand their position. After all, it is not Simmias\u2019s height\ntaken by itself that necessitates his being taller than anyone; it is\nonly his height taken together with that of another, say,\nSocrates. And yet, despite the naturalness of this way of construing\nreductive realism, it is not the way its proponents typically\nunderstand\n it.[21]\n On the contrary, instead of identifying relations such as tallness or\nshortness with pairs of monadic properties taken jointly, reductive\nrealists typically identify them with the individual members of such\npairs. Thus, if Simmias is taller than Socrates, it is only Simmias\u2019s\nheight that is identified with Simmias\u2019s tallness (and hence said to\ncorrespond to the concept \u2018taller than\u2019), whereas\nSocrates\u2019s height is identified with Socrates\u2019s shortness (and hence\nsaid to correspond to the concept \u2018shorter than\u2019). But how\nis this possible, especially if the properties in question are\nsupposed to be just ordinary heights?\n\n\nReductive realists recognize the worry here, as well as the initial\nattraction of identifying relations with pairs of accidents taken\njointly. As evidence, consider the following passage from one of Henry\nHarclay\u2019s later works.  Here Henry not only entertains the suggestion\nthat relations could be identified with pairs of monadic properties,\nbut draws on a common medieval view about number to make it\nplausible:\n\n\nA relation is clearly a reality distinct from one foundation, but\nnot a reality distinct from both foundations. For when one white thing\n[such as Simmias] is posited and then another white thing [such as\nSocrates] is posited, there is a relation beginning at that point.\nThus, the similarity is not a [single] whiteness, but two whitenesses\nexisting at once. Indeed, the two whitenesses can be sufficient to\nconstitute a single species in the genus of relation. Just as two\ndiscrete unities of whatever magnitude are sufficient for producing a\nsingle species of number, so too the same thing holds for the case at\nhand. Again, just as plurality or multitude is not a reality different\nfrom the constituents of the plurality or multitude, neither is the\nsimilarity [of the white things] different [from their\nwhitenesses]. (\u201cUtrum Dei,\u201d n.\n 46)[22]\n\n\n\nDespite Henry\u2019s attraction to this sort of view, he\nfeels compelled to reject it on the grounds that it leads\nto certain absurdities. Drawing on Avicenna for support, he says:\n\n\nAvicenna argues against this on the basis of relations involving\ninferiority and superiority, for it is clearer in those cases than it\nis for other relations, such as those involving equals. For fatherhood\nis in the father alone and not in the son \u2026 and the same thing\nholds of sonship. Therefore one must hold that there are two relations\n[here]. And in this case it is clear that the relation is not the same\nreality as [the two] foundations because the relation is not in\neverything in which the foundation of the relatum is. This is\nthe case, too, for relations involving equals, even if it is not\n as\n clear. (\u201cUtrum Dei,\u201d n. 46)\n\n\n\n\nHenry\u2019s worry here can be expressed as follows. If a relation such as\nfatherhood is identified with a pair of accidents, then it will follow\nthat fatherhood is partly in the son (since the pair is such that one\nof its members is in the son). But this is absurd. Fatherhood is an\nasymmetrical relation (or as Harclay prefers to put it, a relation\ninvolving superiority and inferiority). That is to say, fatherhood is\nsuch that if an individual a has it in respect of another\nindividual, b, then b cannot have fatherhood in\nrespect of a. But according to Harclay, this is tantamount to\nsaying that \u201cfatherhood is in the father alone and not in the\nson\u201d. And of course he doesn\u2019t think the point is restricted to\nfatherhood. On the contrary, it also holds true of all relations,\nincluding symmetrical relations or \u201cthose involving equals, even\nif it is not as clear\u201d (\u201cUtrum Dei,\u201d n. 47).\n\n\nBut if relations are not to be identified with pairs of accidents, how\ncan reductive realists think of them in terms of ordinary,\nnon-relational accidents? After all, the only other option seems to be\nidentifying them with ordinary accidents taken\nindividually\u2014which as we have seen is problematic. An ordinary\naccident such as Simmias\u2019s height cannot necessitate Simmias\u2019s being\ntaller than anyone.  Indeed, it was precisely this point that led us\nto conclude that \u2018relative-making\u2019 is a description best\nreserved for pairs of accidents taken jointly.\n\n\nNote, however, that it is open to the reductive realist to respond by\nsaying that, although Simmias\u2019s height is not by itself\nrelative-making, it is nonetheless potentially\nrelative-making. In that case, however, the reductive realist can insist\nthat in the presence of another height, such as Socrates\u2019s, it\nbecomes actually relative-making\u2014that is to say, it\ncomes actually to relate Simmias to Socrates. This suggests a third\noption for reductive realists: to maintain that relations are to be\nidentified with ordinary, non-relational accidents in certain\ncircumstances.\n\n\nIn fact, it is this last sort of view that most reductive realists\nduring the medieval period actually hold. Indeed, as we are\ninterpreting Harclay, this is precisely the view he goes on to develop\nin the discussion we have been\n following.[23] \n Simmias\u2019s being taller than Socrates is to be identified, on his\nview, not with Simmias\u2019s height tout court, but with\nSimmias\u2019s height in certain circumstances\u2014including the\ncircumstance that Socrates is\n five-feet-ten.[24]\n To put Harclay\u2019s view in a slightly different way, which will\nhelp to bring out its semantic consequences, we might say that in a\nworld in which Simmias exists by himself a predication of the form\n\u2018Simmias is taller than Socrates\u2019 will be false, and hence\nnothing will correspond to the relational term \u2018taller\nthan\u2019. But in a world in which Simmias is six-feet-tall while\nSocrates is five-feet-ten, a predication of the same form will be\ntrue, and in this world there will be something corresponding to\n\u2018taller\u2019, namely, Simmias\u2019s height. In such a world,\nmedieval philosophers would say that \u2018taller\u2019 primarily\nsignifies Simmias\u2019s height, but indirectly signifies or connotes the\nheight of\n Socrates.[25]\n\n\nAs it turns out, it is not only reductive realists, but non-reductive\nrealists as well that speak of relations as accidents of single\nsubjects\u2014that is, of Simmias\u2019s tallness as something belonging\nonly to him, of Socrates\u2019s shortness as something belonging only to\nhim, and so on for all other particular relations. In light of what\nhas just been said, therefore, we can clarify our understanding of the\nparadigmatic analysis of relational situations. As indicated earlier,\nthis analysis requires that when a predication of the form\n\u2018aRb\u2019 is true, what makes it true is a pair of\nindividuals, a and b, and a pair of monadic\nproperties or accidents, F and G. Reductive\nrealists, as we have just seen, identify F and G\nwith ordinary categorial accidents, whereas non-reductive realists\nidentify them with accidents of sui generis type. But however\nwe construe the nature of these accidents, both reductive and\nnon-reductive realists deny that it is the pair of\naccidents\u2014that is, F and G taken\njointly\u2014that corresponds to our relational concepts. On the\ncontrary, they say, F directly corresponds to one of our\nrelational concepts, whereas G directly corresponds to its\nconverse. Thus, when Simmias is taller than Socrates, reductivists and\nnon-reductivists are agreed that it is an accident of Simmias that\ndirectly corresponds to (or as they would prefer to say, is primarily\nsignified by) the concept \u2018taller than\u2019, and an accident\nof Socrates that is primarily signified by the concept \u2018shorter\nthan\u2019. To the extent they disagree, therefore, their\ndisagreement concerns only whether the accidents primarily signified\nby relational concepts can also be signified by ordinary\nnon-relational concepts (and if so, precisely how and under what\ncircumstances).\n\n\nWith these clarifications in mind, let us turn now to the\nconsiderations that led some medieval philosophers to reject reductive\nrealism in favor of some form of non-reductivism.\n",
