    "main_text": "Replicating, Repeating, and Reproducing Scientific Results || An Interdisciplinary Account\n1.2 An Interdisciplinary Account\n\nG\u00f3mez, Juristo, and Vega\u2019s (2010) survey of the\nliterature in 18 disciplines identified 79 types of replication, not\nall of which they considered entirely distinct. They identify five\nmain ways in which a replication study may diverge from an initial\nstudy. With some similarities to Schimdt\u2019s four classes\nabove:\n\nThe site or spatial location of the\nreplication experiment: replication experiments may be conducted in a\nlocation that is or is not the same as the site of the initial\nstudy.\nThe experimenters conducting a replication may\nbe exclusively the same as the original, exclusively different, or a\ncombination of new and original experimenters\nThe apparatus, including the design,\nmaterials, instruments and other important experimental objects and/or\nprocedures may vary between original and replication studies.\nThe operationalisations employed may differ,\nwhere operationalisation refers to measurement of variables. For\nexample, in psychology this might include using two different scales\nmeasuring for depression (as a dependent variable).\nFinally, studies may vary on population\nproperties.\n\n\nA change in any one or combination of these elements in a replication\nstudy corresponds to different purposes underlying the study, and\nthereby establishes a different kind of validity. Like Schmidt et al.\nthen systematically work through how changes to each of the above work\nto fulfil different epistemic functions.\n\nFunction 1. Conclusion Validity and\nControlling for Sampling Error: If each of the five elements\nabove are unchanged in a replication study, then the purpose of the\nreplication is to control for sampling error, that is, to\nverify that previous results in a sample were not obtained purely by\nchance outcomes which make the sample misleading or unrepresentative.\nThis provides a safeguard against what is known as a type I\nerror: incorrectly failing to reject the null hypothesis\n(that is, the hypothesis that there is no relationship between two\nphenomena under investigation). These studies establish conclusion\nvalidity, that is, the credibility or believability of an\nobserved relationship or phenomenon.\nFunction 2. Internal Validity and Controlling\nfor Artefactual Results: If a replication study differs with\nrespect to the site, experimenters or apparatus, then its purpose is\nto establish that previously observed results are not an artefact of a\nparticular apparatus, lab or so on. These studies establish\ninternal validity, that is, the extent to which results can\nbe attributed to the experimental manipulation itself rather than to\nextraneous variables.\nFunction 3. Construct Validity and Determining\nLimits for Operationalizations: If a replication study differs\nwith respect to operationalisations, then its purpose is to determine\nthe extent to which the effect generalizes across measures of\nmanipulated or dependent variables (e.g., the extent to which the\neffect does not depend on the particular psychometric test one uses to\nevaluate depression or IQ). Such studies fulfil the function of\nestablishing construct validity in that they provide evidence\nthat the effect holds across different ways of measuring the\nconstructs.\nFunction 4. External Validity and Determining\nLimits in the Population Properties: If a replication study\ndiffers with respect to its population properties, then its purpose is\nto ascertain the extent to which the results are generalizable to\ndifferent populations, populations which, in G\u00f3mez, Juristo,\nand Vegas\u2019s view, concern subjects and experimental objects such\nas programs. Such studies reinforce external\nvalidity\u2014the extent to which the results are generalizable\nto different populations.\n\n",
