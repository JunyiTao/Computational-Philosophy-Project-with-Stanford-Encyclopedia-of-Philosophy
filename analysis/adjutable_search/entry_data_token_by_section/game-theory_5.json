    "main_text": "Basic Elements and Assumptions of Game Theory || Solution Concepts and Equilibria\n2.5 Solution Concepts and Equilibria\n\nIn the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, the outcome we\u2019ve represented\nas (2,2), indicating mutual defection, was said to be the\n\u2018solution\u2019 to the game. Following the general practice in\neconomics, game theorists refer to the solutions of games as\nequilibria. Philosophically minded readers will want to pose\na conceptual question right here: What is \u2018equilibrated\u2019\nabout some game outcomes such that we are motivated to call them\n\u2018solutions\u2019? When we say that a physical system is in\nequilibrium, we mean that it is in a stable state, one in\nwhich all the causal forces internal to the system balance each other\nout and so leave it \u2018at rest\u2019 until and unless it is\nperturbed by the intervention of some exogenous (that is,\n\u2018external\u2019) force. This is what economists have\ntraditionally meant in talking about \u2018equilibria\u2019; they\nread economic systems as being networks of mutually constraining\n(often causal) relations, just like physical systems, and the\nequilibria of such systems are then their endogenously stable states.\n(Note that, in both physical and economic systems, endogenously stable\nstates might never be directly observed because the systems in\nquestion are never isolated from exogenous influences that move and\ndestabilize them. In both classical mechanics and in economics,\nequilibrium concepts are tools for analysis, not predictions\nof what we expect to observe.) As we will see in later sections, it is\npossible to maintain this understanding of equilibria in the case of\ngame theory. However, as we noted in Section 2.1, some people\ninterpret game theory as being an explanatory theory of strategic\nreasoning. For them, a solution to a game must be an outcome that a\nrational agent would predict using the mechanisms of rational\ncomputation alone. Such theorists face some puzzles about\nsolution concepts that are less important to the theorist who\nisn\u2019t trying to use game theory to under-write a general\nanalysis of rationality. The interest of philosophers in game theory\nis more often motivated by this ambition than is that of the economist\nor other scientist. \n\nIt\u2019s useful to start the discussion here from the case of the\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma because it\u2019s unusually simple from the\nperspective of the puzzles about solution concepts. What we referred\nto as its \u2018solution\u2019 is the unique Nash\nequilibrium of the game. (The \u2018Nash\u2019 here refers to\nJohn Nash, the Nobel Laureate mathematician who in\n Nash (1950)\n did most to extend and generalize von Neumann &\nMorgenstern\u2019s pioneering work.) Nash equilibrium (henceforth\n\u2018NE\u2019) applies (or fails to apply, as the case may be) to\nwhole sets of strategies, one for each player in a game. A\nset of strategies is a NE just in case no player could improve her\npayoff, given the strategies of all other players in the game, by\nchanging her strategy. Notice how closely this idea is related to the\nidea of strict dominance: no strategy could be a NE strategy if it is\nstrictly dominated. Therefore, if iterative elimination of strictly\ndominated strategies takes us to a unique outcome, we know that the\nvector of strategies that leads to it is the game\u2019s unique NE.\nNow, almost all theorists agree that avoidance of strictly dominated\nstrategies is a minimum requirement of economic rationality.\nA player who knowingly chooses a strictly dominated strategy directly\nviolates clause (iii) of the definition of economic agency as given in\n Section 2.2.\n This implies that if a game has an outcome that is a unique\nNE, as in the case of joint confession in the PD, that must be its\nunique solution. This is one of the most important respects in which\nthe PD is an \u2018easy\u2019 (and atypical) game.\n\nWe can specify one class of games in which NE is always not only\nnecessary but sufficient as a solution concept. These are\nfinite perfect-information games that are also zero-sum. A\nzero-sum game (in the case of a game involving just two players) is\none in which one player can only be made better off by making the\nother player worse off. (Tic-tac-toe is a simple example of such a\ngame: any move that brings one player closer to winning brings her\nopponent closer to losing, and vice-versa.) We can determine whether a\ngame is zero-sum by examining players\u2019 utility functions: in\nzero-sum games these will be mirror-images of each other, with one\nplayer\u2019s highly ranked outcomes being low-ranked for the other\nand vice-versa. In such a game, if I am playing a strategy such that,\ngiven your strategy, I can\u2019t do any better, and if you are\nalso playing such a strategy, then, since any change of\nstrategy by me would have to make you worse off and vice-versa, it\nfollows that our game can have no solution compatible with our mutual\neconomic rationality other than its unique NE. We can put this another\nway: in a zero-sum game, my playing a strategy that maximizes my\nminimum payoff if you play the best you can, and your simultaneously\ndoing the same thing, is just equivalent to our both playing\nour best strategies, so this pair of so-called \u2018maximin\u2019\nprocedures is guaranteed to find the unique solution to the game,\nwhich is its unique NE. (In tic-tac-toe, this is a draw. You\ncan\u2019t do any better than drawing, and neither can I, if both of\nus are trying to win and trying not to lose.)\n\nHowever, most games do not have this property. It won\u2019t be\npossible, in this one article, to enumerate all of the ways\nin which games can be problematic from the perspective of their\npossible solutions. (For one thing, it is highly unlikely that\ntheorists have yet discovered all of the possible problems.) However,\nwe can try to generalize the issues a bit.\n\nFirst, there is the problem that in most non-zero-sum games, there is\nmore than one NE, but not all NE look equally plausible as the\nsolutions upon which strategically alert players would hit. Consider\nthe strategic-form game below (taken from\n (Kreps 1990, p. 403)\n (and which we\u2019ll encounter again later under the name\n\u2018Hi-lo\u2019):\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\\(t_1\\)\n\\(t_2\\)\n\nI\n\\(s_1\\)\n10,10\n0,0\n\n\\(s_2\\)\n0,0\n1,1 \n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\nThis game has two NE: \\(s_1\\)-\\(t_1\\) and \\(s_2\\)-\\(t_2\\). (Note that\nno rows or columns are strictly dominated here. But if Player I is\nplaying \\(s_1\\) then Player II can do no better than \\(t_1,\\) and\nvice-versa; and similarly for the \\(s_2\\)-\\(t_2\\) pair.) If NE is our\nonly solution concept, then we shall be forced to say that either of\nthese outcomes is equally persuasive as a solution. However, if game\ntheory is regarded as an explanatory and/or normative theory of\nstrategic reasoning, this seems to be leaving something out: surely\nsensible players with perfect information would converge on\n\\(s_1\\)-\\(t_1\\)? (Note that this is not like the situation in\nthe PD, where the socially superior situation is unachievable because\nit is not a NE. In the case of the game above, both players have every\nreason to try to converge on the NE in which they are better off.)\n\nThis illustrates the fact that NE is a relatively (logically)\nweak solution concept, often failing to predict intuitively\nsensible solutions because, if applied alone, it refuses to allow\nplayers to use principles of equilibrium selection that, if not\ndemanded by economic rationality\u2014or a more ambitious\nphilosopher\u2019s concept of rationality\u2014at least seem both\nsensible and computationally accessible. Consider another example from\n Kreps (1990),\n p. 397:\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\\(t_1\\)\n\\(t_2\\)\n\nI\n\\(s_1\\)\n10,0\n5,2\n\n\\(s_2\\)\n10,1\n2,0 \n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\nHere, no strategy strictly dominates another. However, Player\nI\u2019s top row, \\(s_1,\\) weakly dominates \\(s_2,\\) since I\ndoes at least as well using \\(s_1\\) as \\(s_2\\) for any reply\nby Player II, and on one reply by II (\\(t_2\\)), I does better. So\nshould not the players (and the analyst) delete the weakly dominated\nrow \\(s_2\\)? When they do so, column \\(t_1\\) is then strictly\ndominated, and the NE \\(s_1\\)-\\(t_2\\) is selected as the unique\nsolution. However, as Kreps goes on to show using this example, the\nidea that weakly dominated strategies should be deleted just like\nstrict ones has odd consequences.\n Suppose\n we change the payoffs of the game just a bit, as follows:\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\\(t_1\\)\n\\(t_2\\)\n\nI\n\\(s_1\\)\n10,10\n5,2\n\n\\(s_2\\)\n10,11\n2,0 \n\n\nFigure 8\n\n\n\\(s_2\\) is still weakly dominated as before; but of our two NE,\n\\(s_2\\)-\\(t_1\\) is now the most attractive for both players; so why\nshould the analyst eliminate its possibility? (Note that this game,\nagain, does not replicate the logic of the PD. There, it\nmakes sense to eliminate the most attractive outcome, joint refusal to\nconfess, because both players have incentives to unilaterally deviate\nfrom it, so it is not an NE. This is not true of \\(s_2\\)-\\(t_1\\) in\nthe present game. You should be starting to clearly see why we called\nthe PD game \u2018atypical\u2019.) The argument for\neliminating weakly dominated strategies is that Player 1 may be\nnervous, fearing that Player II is not completely sure to be\neconomically rational (or that Player II fears that Player I\nisn\u2019t completely reliably economically rational, or that Player\nII fears that Player I fears that Player II isn\u2019t completely\nreliably economically rational, and so on ad infinitum) and so might\nplay \\(t_2\\) with some positive probability. If the possibility of\ndepartures from reliable economic rationality is taken seriously, then\nwe have an argument for eliminating weakly dominated strategies:\nPlayer I thereby insures herself against her worst outcome,\n\\(s_2\\)-\\(t_2\\). Of course, she pays a cost for this insurance,\nreducing her expected payoff from 10 to 5. On the other hand, we might\nimagine that the players could communicate before playing the game and\nagree to coordinate on \\(s_2\\)-\\(t_1\\), thereby removing\nsome, most or all of the uncertainty that encourages elimination of\nthe weakly dominated row \\(s_1\\), and eliminating \\(s_1\\)-\\(t_2\\) as a\nviable solution instead!\n\nAny proposed principle for solving games that may have the effect of\neliminating one or more NE from consideration as solutions is referred\nto as a refinement of NE. In the case just discussed,\nelimination of weakly dominated strategies is one possible refinement,\nsince it refines away the NE \\(s_2\\)-\\(t_1\\), and correlation is\nanother, since it refines away the other NE, \\(s_1\\)-\\(t_2\\), instead.\nSo which refinement is more appropriate as a solution concept? People\nwho think of game theory as an explanatory and/or normative theory of\nstrategic rationality have generated a substantial literature in which\nthe merits and drawbacks of a large number of refinements are debated.\nIn principle, there seems to be no limit on the number of refinements\nthat could be considered, since there may also be no limits on the set\nof philosophical intuitions about what principles a rational agent\nmight or might not see fit to follow or to fear or hope that other\nplayers are following.\n\nWe now digress briefly to make a point about terminology. Theorists\nwho adopt the revealed preference interpretation of the utility\nfunctions in game theory are sometimes referred to in the philosophy\nof economics literature as \u2018behaviorists\u2019. This reflects\nthe fact the revealed preference approaches equate choices with\neconomically consistent actions, rather than being intended to refer\nto mental constructs. Historically, there was a relationship of\ncomfortable alignment, though not direct theoretical co-construction,\nbetween revealed preference in economics and the methodological and\nontological behaviorism that dominated scientific psychology during\nthe middle decades of the twentieth century. However, this usage is\nincreasingly likely to cause confusion due to the more recent rise of\nbehavioral game theory\n (Camerer 2003).\n This program of research aims to directly incorporate into\ngame-theoretic models generalizations, derived mainly from experiments\nwith people, about ways in which people differ from purer economic\nagents in the inferences they draw from information\n(\u2018framing\u2019). Applications also typically incorporate\nspecial assumptions about utility functions, also derived from\nexperiments. For example, players may be taken to be willing to make\ntrade-offs between the magnitudes of their own payoffs and\ninequalities in the distribution of payoffs among the players. We will\nturn to some discussion of behavioral game theory in\n Section 8.1,\n Section 8.2 and\n Section 8.3.\n For the moment, note that this use of game theory crucially rests on\nassumptions about psychological representations of value thought to be\ncommon among people. Thus it would be misleading to refer to\nbehavioral game theory as \u2018behaviorist\u2019. But then it just\nwould invite confusion to continue referring to conventional economic\ngame theory that relies on revealed preference as\n\u2018behaviorist\u2019 game theory. We will therefore refer to it\nas \u2018non-psychological\u2019 game theory. We mean by this the\nkind of game theory used by most economists who are not\nrevisionist behavioral economists. (We use the qualifier\n\u2018revisionist\u2019 to reflect the further complication that\nincreasingly many economists who apply revealed preference concepts\nconduct experiments, and some of them call themselves\n\u2018behavioral economists\u2019! For a proposed new set of\nconventions to reduce this labeling chaos, see\n Ross (2014),\n pp. 200\u2013201.) These \u2018establishment\u2019 economists\ntreat game theory as the abstract mathematics of strategic\ninteraction, rather than as an attempt to directly characterize\nspecial psychological dispositions that might be typical in\nhumans.\n\nNon-psychological game theorists tend to take a dim view of much of\nthe refinement program. This is for the obvious reason that it relies\non intuitions about which kinds of inferences people should\nfind sensible. Like most scientists, non-psychological game theorists\nare suspicious of the force and basis of philosophical assumptions as\nguides to empirical and mathematical modeling.\n\nBehavioral game theory, by contrast, can be understood as a refinement\nof game theory, though not necessarily of its solution concepts, in a\ndifferent sense. It restricts the theory\u2019s underlying axioms for\napplication to a special class of agents, individual, psychologically\ntypical humans. It motivates this restriction by reference to\ninferences, along with preferences, that people do find\nnatural, regardless of whether these seem rational,\nwhich they frequently do not. Non-psychological and behavioral game\ntheory have in common that neither is intended to be\nnormative\u2014though both are often used to try to describe\nnorms that prevail in groups of players, as well to explain\nwhy norms might persist in groups of players even when they appear to\nbe less than fully rational to philosophical intuitions. Both see the\njob of applied game theory as being to predict outcomes of\nempirical games given some distribution of strategic\ndispositions, and some distribution of expectations about the\nstrategic dispositions of others, that are shaped by dynamics in\nplayers\u2019 environments, including institutional pressures and\nstructures and evolutionary selection. Let us therefore group\nnon-psychological and behavioral game theorists together, just for\npurposes of contrast with normative game theorists, as\ndescriptive game theorists.\n\nDescriptive game theorists are often inclined to doubt that the goal\nof seeking a general theory of rationality makes sense as a\nproject. Institutions and evolutionary processes build many\nenvironments, and what counts as rational procedure in one environment\nmay not be favoured in another. On the other hand, an entity that does\nnot at least stochastically (i.e., perhaps noisily but statistically\nmore often than not) satisfy the minimal restrictions of economic\nrationality cannot, except by accident, be accurately characterized as\naiming to maximize a utility function. To such entities game theory\nhas no application in the first place. \n\nThis does not imply that non-psychological game theorists abjure all\nprincipled ways of restricting sets of NE to subsets based on their\nrelative probabilities of arising. In particular, non-psychological\ngame theorists tend to be sympathetic to approaches that shift\nemphasis from rationality onto considerations of the informational\ndynamics of games. We should perhaps not be surprised that NE analysis\nalone often fails to tell us much of applied, empirical interest about\nstrategic-form games (e.g., Figure 6 above), in which informational\nstructure is suppressed. Equilibrium selection issues are often more\nfruitfully addressed in the context of extensive-form games.\n",
