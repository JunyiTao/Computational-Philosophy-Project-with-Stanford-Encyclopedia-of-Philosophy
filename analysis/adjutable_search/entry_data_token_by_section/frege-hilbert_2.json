    "main_text": "Frege\u2014Background And Initial Differences\n3. Frege\u2014Background And Initial Differences\n\nFor Frege, things are radically different. Frege takes it that the\nsentences we use in mathematics are important only because of\nthe nonlinguistic propositions (or, as he puts it, the\n\u201cthoughts\u201d) they express. Mathematicians working in French\nand in German are working on the same subject because, as Frege sees\nit, their sentences express the same thoughts. Each thought is about a\ndeterminate subject-matter, and says something true or false about\nthat\n subject-matter.[7]\n Thoughts are also on this view the things that logically imply or\ncontradict one another, the things that are true or false, and the\nthings that together constitute mathematical theories. Hence, in\nFrege\u2019s view, thoughts, rather than sentences, are the items\nabout which the questions of consistency and independence arise. \n\nBecause each thought has a determinate subject-matter, it makes no\nsense to talk about the \u201creinterpretation\u201d of thoughts.\nThe kind of reinterpretation that Hilbert engages in, i.e., of\nassigning different meanings to specific words, is something that can\napply only to sentences, from the Fregean point of view. Accordingly,\nthe first difficulty Frege notes with Hilbert\u2019s approach is that\nit is not clear what Hilbert means by \u201caxioms:\u201d if he\nmeans the kinds of things for which issues of consistency and\nindependence can arise, then he must be talking about thoughts, while\nif he means the kinds of things that are susceptible of multiple\ninterpretations, then he must be talking about sentences.\n\nThe difficulties multiply from here. When Hilbert provides a specific\nreinterpretation of the geometric terms en route to proving\nthe relative consistency of a set AX of sentences, Frege notes\nthat we now have two different sets of thoughts in play: the set we\nmight call \u201c\\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\)\u201d of thoughts expressed\nwhen AX\u2019s terms take their ordinary geometric meanings\n(e.g., on which \u201cpoint\u201d means point) and the set\nwe might call \u201c\\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\)\u201d of thoughts expressed\nwhen AX\u2019s terms take the meanings assigned by\nHilbert\u2019s re-interpretation (on which, e.g., \u201cpoint\u201d\nmeans pair of real numbers). Hilbert\u2019s reinterpretation\nstrategy involves, from Frege\u2019s point of view, simply shifting\nour attention from the set \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\) of thoughts ordinarily\nexpressed by the sentences AX (and in whose consistency we are\ninterested) to the new set \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) of thoughts expressed\nby AX under the reinterpretation. And the fact that the\nreinterpreted sentences express truths about real numbers has little\nto do, from Frege\u2019s perspective, with the consistency and\nindependence questions that arise for the original thoughts about\npoints, lines, and planes.\n\nIn addition to the confusing (as Frege sees it) practice of shifting\nback and forth between different sets of thoughts while discussing a\ngiven set of sentences, Hilbert\u2019s procedure also involves, as\nFrege sees it, two further questionable aspects.\n\nThe first concerns the need for consistency proofs. On Frege\u2019s\nview, the axioms of a theory always form a collection of true\nthoughts; and since truth implies consistency, the consistency of a\ncollection of axioms is never in need of demonstration. For Hilbert on\nthe other hand, the fact that a collection of sentences is taken as\naxiomatic is no guarantee of truth (or of truth under a given\ninterpretation), and a demonstration of consistency is often a crucial\nstep in establishing the mathematical respectability of that\ncollection of axioms.\n\nSecondly, Hilbert and Frege differ importantly over the connection\nbetween truth and consistency. Taking a theory to be axiomatized by a\nset of multiply-interpretable sentences, Hilbert\u2019s view is that the\nconsistency of such a set suffices for the existence of the (or a)\ncollection of mathematical entities mentioned in the theory. The\nconsistency, for example, of a theory of complex numbers is all\nthat\u2019s needed to justify the mathematical practice of reasoning in\nterms of such numbers. For Frege on the other hand, consistency can\nnever guarantee existence. His preferred example to make this point is\nthat the consistency (in Hilbert\u2019s sense) of the trio of\nsentences \n\nA is an intelligent being\nA is omnipresent\nA is omnipotent\n\n\nis insufficient to guarantee their instantiation. (See, e.g.,\nFrege\u2019s letter to Hilbert of 6 January 1900; Frege 1980: 47.)\n\n\nThe central difference between Frege and Hilbert over the nature of\naxioms, i.e., over the question whether axioms are determinately true\nclaims about a fixed subject-matter or reinterpretable sentences\nexpressing multiply-instantiable conditions, lies at the heart of the\ndifference between an older way of thinking of theories, exemplified\nby Frege, and a new way that gathered strength at the end of the\nnineteenth century. Perhaps most clearly illustrated in Dedekind 1888,\nthe central idea of the new approach is to understand mathematical\ntheories as characterizing general \u201cstructural\u201d conditions that\nmight be had in common by any number of different ordered domains.\nJust as, in algebra, the axioms for a group give general\nconditions that can be satisfied by any manner of object whatsoever\nunder appropriate relations, so too on the new view the axioms of\ngeometry specify multiply-instantiable conditions. Viewing theories\nfrom this modern perspective, it is entirely appropriate to take\naxioms as Hilbert does, since reinterpretable sentences are the right\nvehicles to express the multiply-instantiable conditions in\n question.[8]\n From the point of view of the earlier fixed-domain conception of\ntheories, on the other hand, such reinterpretable sentences are\nentirely inappropriate as axioms, since they fail to fix a determinate\nsubject-matter. On this question, i.e., the issue of the fixed-domain\n(Fregean) vs. multiply-instantiable structure (Hilbertian) conception\nof mathematical theories, the jury is still out: this debate continues\nto animate contemporary philosophy of mathematics (see entry on\n philosophy of mathematics).\n \n\nThe second issue that divides Frege and Hilbert, regarding the\njustifiability of the inference from consistency to existence, is also\nstill alive. While everybody (including presumably Hilbert) would\nagree with Frege that outside of the mathematical domain we cannot\nsafely infer existence from consistency, the question remains whether\nwe can (or must) do so within mathematics. The Fregean point of view\nis that the existence of mathematical objects can only be proven (if\nat all) by appeal to more fundamental principles, while the Hilbertian\npoint of view is that in appropriate purely-mathematical cases, there\nis nothing more to be demonstrated, in order to establish existence,\nthan the consistency of a theory (see entries on\n philosophy of mathematics\n and\n Platonism in the philosophy of mathematics).\n \n\nDespite these differences, Frege and Hilbert agree that there are\nimportant mathematical questions to be asked regarding consistency and\nindependence, and they agree that, e.g., the classic question of the\nindependence of the parallels axiom from the remainder of Euclidean\ngeometry is a significant one. But they disagree, as noted above,\nabout whether Hilbert\u2019s procedure suffices to settle these\nquestions. We turn next to the issue of Frege\u2019s rationale for\nrejecting Hilbert\u2019s method for proving consistency and\nindependence. \n",
