    "main_text": "Embedded (or indirect) questions || Question-relativity\n4.5 Question-relativity\n\nWhere Bo\u00ebr and Lycan view knowing-wh as context-relative,\nSchaffer (2007) views it as question-relative. The problem, according\nto Schaffer, is that if knowledge-wh is reduced to knowledge-that and\nis not question-relative, then cases of knowledge-wh that should be\ndistinguished will not be distinguished. Schaffer calls this the\nProblem of Convergent Knowledge. For example, suppose that (47) is\ntrue:\n\n (47) John knows that\nthe cat is on the mat. \n\n\nOn a non-question-relative account of knowledge-wh that reduces\nknowledge-wh to knowledge-that, all three of the following will be\nequivalent because all three can be reduced to (47): \n\n (48)  a.\nJohn knows whether the\ncat is on the mat or in the garage.  \n   b.\nJohn knows where the cat\nis.  \n   c.\nJohn knows what is on\nthe mat.  \n\n\nSchaffer argues that sentences like (48a\u2013c) are not equivalent.\nAccording to Schaffer\u2019s account, assuming the cat is indeed on\nthe mat, to know where the cat is is to know that the cat is on the\nmat relative to the question \u2018Where is the cat?\u2019, whereas\nto know what is on the mat is to know that the cat is on the mat\nrelative to the question \u2018What is on the mat?\u2019. Schaffer\nargues, in the end, that all knowledge, including knowledge-that, is\nquestion-relative. Aloni and \u00c9gr\u00e9 (2010) offer a\ndifferent take on Schaffer\u2019s Problem of Convergent Knowledge,\narguing that it reveals a pragmatic ambiguity concerning what it means\nto know the answer to a wh-question. \n",
