    "main_text": "Criteria\n3. Criteria\n\nConsider the following:\n\nMalory has promised to take Chris grocery shopping.  Unfortunately, as\nMalory is leaving the apartment, Sam calls with an urgent request:\nplease come over to my house right now, my pipes have broken and I\nneed help! Torn, Malory decides to help Sam, and thus breaks a promise\nto Chris.\n\nHas Malory done the right thing? The virtuous thing? \nMalory has broken a promise, which is pro tanto wrong, but Sam\nis in an emergency and needs help right away. Even if it is clear\nthat what Malory did was right in the circumstances, it is an\ninteresting question as to why it is right. What can we appeal to in\nmaking these sorts of judgments? This brings to light the issue\nof how one morally justifies one\u2019s actions. This\nis the task of understanding what the justifying reasons are for our\nactions. What makes an action the thing to do in the\ncircumstances? This is the criterion of rightness (or\nwrongness). We will focus on the criterion of rightness, though\nthe criterion issue comes up with other modes of moral evaluation, such\nas judging an action to be virtuous, or judging it to be good in some\nrespect, even if not right. Indeed, some writers have argued that\n\u2018morally right\u2019 should be jettisoned from modern secular\nethics, as it presupposes a conceptual framework left over from\nreligiously based accounts which assume there is a God (Anscombe\n1958). We will leave these worries aside for now, however, and\nfocus on standard accounts of criteria.\n\nThe following are some toy examples that exhibit differing\nstructural features for moral theories and set out different\ncriteria: \n\n\nConsequentialism. The right action is the action that\nproduces good amongst the options open to the agent at the\ntime of action (Singer). The most well-known version of this\ntheory is Classical Utilitarianism, which holds that the right action\npromotes pleasure (Mill).\n\nKantian Deontology. The morally worthy action is in\naccordance with the Categorical Imperative, which requires an agent\nrefrain from acting in a way that fails to respect the rational nature\nof other persons (Kant).\n\nRossian Deontology. The right action is the action that best\naccords with the fulfillment and/or non-violation of one\u2019s\nprima facie duties (Ross).\n\nContractualism.An action is morally wrong if it is an act that\nwould be forbidden by principles that rational persons could not\nreasonably reject (Scanlon).\n\nVirtue Ethics.The right action is the action that a virtuous\nperson would characteristically perform in the circumstances\n(Hursthouse 1999).\n\n\nThese principles set out the criterion or standard\nfor evaluation of actions. They do not necessarily tell us\nhow to perform right actions, and are not, in themselves,\ndecision-procedures, though they can easily be turned into decision\nprocedures, such as: you ought to try to perform the action that\nmaximizes the good amongst the options available to you at the time of\naction. This might not be, and in ordinary circumstance probably\nisn\u2019t, a very good decision-procedure, and would itself need to\nbe evaluated according to the criterion set out by the theory.\n\nThese theories can be divided, roughly, into the deontological,\nconsequentialist, and virtue ethical categories. There has been a\nlively debate about how, exactly, to delineate these categories. \nSome have held that deontological theories were just those theories\nthat were not consequentialist. A popular conception of\nconsequentialist theories is that they are reductionist in a particular\nway \u2013 that is, in virtue of reducing deontic features of actions\n(e.g. rightness, obligatoriness) to facts about an agent\u2019s\noptions and the consequences of those options (Smith 2009). If\nthat is the case, then it seems that deontological approaches are just\nthe ones that are not reductive in this manner. However, this\nfails to capture the distinctive features of many forms of virtue\nethics, which are neither consequentialist nor necessarily concerned\nwith what we ought to do, our duties as opposed to\nwhat sorts of persons we should be.\n\nOne way to distinguish consequentialist from deontological theories\nis in terms of how each approaches value. Philip Pettit has\nsuggested that while consequentialist theories required\npromotion of value, deontological theories recommend that\nvalue be honored or respected.  On each of\nthese views, value is an important component of the theory, and\ntheories will be partially delineated according to their theory of\nvalue. A utilitarian such as Jeremey Bentham believes that hedonism is\nthe correct theory of value, whereas someone such as G. E. Moore, a\nutilitarian but a pluralist regarding value, believes that hedonism is\nmuch too narrow an account. A Kantian, on the other hand, views\nvalue as grounded in rational nature, in a will conforming to the\nCategorical Imperative.\n\nBecause of the systematizing function of moral theory discussed\nearlier, the simplest account is to be preferred and thus there is a\nmove away from endorsing value pluralism. Of course, as intuitive\npressure is put on each of the simpler alternatives, a pluralistic\naccount of criteria for rightness and wrongness has the advantage of\naccording best with moral intuitions.\n\nReasons-first philosophers will delineate the theories somewhat\ndifferently. For example, one might understand goodness as a\nmatter of what we have reason to desire, in which case what we have\nreason to desire is prior to goodness rather than the other way\naround. Value is still an important component of the theories, it\nis simply that the value is grounded in reasons.\n\nAnother distinction between normative theories is that between\nsubjective and objective versions of a type of theory. This\ndistinction cuts across other categories. For example, there are\nsubjective forms of all the major moral theories, and objective\nversions of many. An objective standard of right holds that the agent\nmust actually meet the standard \u2013 and meeting the standard is\nsomething \u2018objective\u2019, not dependent on the agent\u2019s\npsychological states \u2013 in order to count as right or\nvirtuous. Subjective standards come in two broad forms:\n\nPsychology sensitive: are the justifying reasons part of\nthe agent\u2019s deliberative processes? Or, more weakly, are they\n\u201crecoverable\u201d from the agent\u2019s psychology [perhaps,\nfor example, the agent has a commitment to the values that provide the\nreasons].\nEvidence sensitive: the right action isn\u2019t the one\nthat actually meets the standard, but instead, is the action that the\nagent could foresee would meet that standard. [there are many\ndifferent ways to spell this out, depending on the degree of evidence\nthat is relevant: in terms of what the agent actually foresees, what\nis foreseeable by the agent given what the agent knows, is foreseeable\nby someone in possession of a reasonable amount of evidence, etc.]\n\n\nOf course, these two can overlap. For theorists who are\nevaluational internalists, evidence-sensitivity doesn\u2019t\nseem like a plausible way of spelling out the standard, except,\nperhaps, indirectly. The distinction frequently comes up in\nConsequentialism, where the Objective standard is taken to be something\nlike: the right action is the action that actually promotes the\ngood and the Subjective standard is something like: the right\naction is the action that promotes the good by the agent\u2019s own\nlights (psychology sensitive) or the right action is the action that\npromotes the foreseeable good, given evidence available at the time of\naction (evidence sensitive standard). It is certainly possible\nfor other moral standards to be objective. For example, the right\naction is the action that the virtuous person would perform, even\nthough the agent does not realize it is what the virtuous agent would\ndo in the circumstances, and even if the person with the best available\nevidence couldn\u2019t realize it is what the virtuous person would do\nin the circumstances.\n\nWe certainly utter locutions that support both subjective and\nobjective uses of what we \u2018ought\u2019 to do, or what is\n\u2018right\u2019. Frank Jackson notes this when he writes:\n\n\u2026we have no alternative but to recognize a whole range of\noughts \u2013 what she ought to do by the light of her beliefs at the\ntime of action, \u2026what she ought to do by the lights of one or\nanother onlooker who has different information on the subject, and,\nwhat is more, what she ought to do by God\u2019s lights\u2026that\nis, by the lights of one who knows what will and would happen\nfor each and every course of action. (Jackson 1991, 471).\n\nFor Jackson, the primary ought, the primary sense of\n\u2018rightness\u2019 for an action, is the one that is \u201cmost\nimmediately relevant to action\u201d since, otherwise, we have a\nproblem of understanding how the action is the agent\u2019s. \nThus, the subjective \u2018ought\u2019 is primary in the sense that\nthis is the one that ethical theory should be concerned with (Jackson\n1991). Each type of theorist makes use of our ordinary language\nintuitions to make their case. But one desideratum of a theory is that\nit not simply reflect those intuitions, but also provides the tools to\ncritically analyze them. Given that our language allows for\nboth sorts of \u2018ought,\u2019 the interesting issue becomes which,\nif either, has primacy in terms of actually providing the standard by\nwhich other things are evaluated? Moral theory needn\u2019t only\nbe concerned with what the right action is from the agent\u2019s point\nof view.\n\nThere are three possibilities:\n\nneither has primacy\nthe subjective has primacy\nthe objective has primacy\n\n\nFirst off we need to understand what we mean by\n\u201cprimacy\u201d. Again, for Frank Jackson, the primary\nsense of \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018ought\u2019 is subjective,\nsince what we care about is the \u2018right\u2019 that refers to an\ninward story, the story of our agency, so to speak. On this view,\nthe objective and subjective senses may have no relationship to each\nother at all, and which counts as primary simply depends upon our\ninterests. However, the issue that concerns us here is whether or\nnot one sense can be accounted for in terms of the\nother. Option 1 holds that there is no explanatory\nconnection. That is not as theoretically satisfying. Option 2\nholds either there really is no meaningful objective sense, just the\nsubjective sense, or the objective sense is understood in terms of the\nsubjective. \n\nLet\u2019s look at the objective locution again \u201cHe did the\nright thing, but he didn\u2019t know it at the time (or he had no way\nof knowing it at the time)\u201d. Perhaps all this means is \u201cHe\ndid what someone with all the facts and correct set of values would\nhave judged right by their own lights\u201d \u2013 this would be\nextensionally the same as \u201cHe performed the action with the best\nactual consequences\u201d. This is certainly a possible account of\nwhat objective right means which makes use of a subjective\nstandard. But it violates the spirit of the subjective standard, since\nit ties rightness neither to the psychology of the agent, or the\nevidence that is actually available to the agent. For that reason, it\nseems more natural to opt for 3. An advantage of this option is that\ngives us a nice, unified account regarding the connection between the\nobjective and the subjective. Subjective standards, then, are\nstandards of praise and blame, which are themselves evaluable\naccording to the objective standard. Over time, people are in a\nposition to tell whether or not a standard actually works in a given\ntype of context. Or, perhaps it turns out that there are several\nstandards of blame that differ in terms of severity. For example,\nif someone acts negligently a sensible case can be made that the person\nis blameworthy but not as blameworthy as if they had acted\nintentionally.\n\nAs to the worry that the objective standard doesn\u2019t provide\naction guidance, the objective theorist can hold that action guidance\nis provided by the subjective standards of\npraise/blameworthiness. Further, the standard itself can provide\nwhat we need for action guidance through normative review (Driver\n2012). Normative review is a retrospective look at what does in fact\nmeet the standard, and under what circumstances.\n\nNow, consider a virtue ethical example. The right action is\nthe action that is the actual action that a virtuous person would\nperform characteristically, in the circumstances, rather than the\naction that the agent believes is the one the virtuous person would\nperform. Then we evaluate an agent\u2019s \u201cv-rules\u201d\nin terms of how close they meet the virtuous ideal.\n",
