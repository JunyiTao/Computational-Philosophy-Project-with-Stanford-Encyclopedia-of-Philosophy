How to Comment on Aristotle as a Neoplatonist?\n\nThe Neoplatonic commentaries of late Antiquity represent rather\nsophisticated readings of Plato and Aristotle, integrating a rich\nprehistory of exegesis and philosophical debate, but also structured\naccording to certain well-defined rules and methods. Since Simplicius\ncomes almost at the end of this tradition, his commentaries are also a\nrepository from which such constituent parts of Platonic exegetical\npractices can be reconstructed. Generally speaking, both ancient and\nmedieval commentators share a nondevelopmentalist approach to their\nauthors and treat single works as part of a greater philosophical\nwhole or system. Simplicius\u2019 main aim is to clarify the\nAristotelian text, explain Aristotle by means of his own writings, and\ndemonstrate the harmony of Plato, Aristotle and older pre-Socratic\ntraditions.\n\nSeveral elements are characteristic of Simplicius\u2019 commentaries.\nAll are lemmatised, that is, Aristotle\u2019s (or Epictetus\u2019)\ntext is divided into smaller sections of text which are then commented\nupon, and the commentaries are introduced with prologues of varying\nlengths (see below for more details). The comments on a single lemma\nare sometimes subdivided into two sections, one which mainly comments\non the philosophical content (the\u00f4ria) and one which\ncomments on single expressions or words (lexis). Such a\ndistinction goes back to Proclus (Festugi\u00e8re 1963 [1971]).\nSince the commentaries are probably not written for teaching purposes\n(see\n \u00a71),\n they are not structured according to \u201clessons\u201d\n(praxeis), as was the usual practice in the Alexandrian\nschool after Ammonius. Digressions or autonomous essays that interrupt\nthe running commentary are also characteristic of Simplicius (see\nGolitsis 2008a and\n \u00a72.3 in the supplement \u201cThe Commentaries of Simplicius\u201d).\n Like Aristotle, Simplicius frequently integrates longer doxographies.\nAt times, he approaches philosophical issues through the method of\n\u201cdifficulties and solutions\u201d (aporiai kai\nluseis), which can frequently be found in Damascius,\nSimplicius\u2019 teacher, and ultimately goes back to Aristotle (cf.\nMetaphysics Beta, with its long list of aporiai).\nFrom Iamblichus, Simplicius borrows the policy that each of\nPlato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s works should be explained by first\nestablishing its main, overarching topics (skopos) which hold\nall the parts together:\n\n\nFor the goal (skopos), once correctly identified, defines and\nrectifies our thought (dianoia), so that we are not vainly\ntransported about in every direction, but refer everything to it.\n(Simplicius, In Cat. 8.13\u201315, translated by Michael\nChase)\n\n\nA common practice among later Neoplatonists was to preface their\ncommentaries with a series of questions or preliminary points\n(kephalaia) that should be settled before embarking on the\nexegesis proper (Hadot & Hoffmann 1990: 21\u2013160; Hoffmann\n1998; Mansfeld 1994; for an excellent (English) summary see Hoffmann\n2006: 607\u2013613). The form that these prolegomena, as\nthey were called, take in Simplicius was introduced by the\nNeoplatonist Proclus (Elias/David, In Cat. 107.24\u201326).\nIn the case of Aristotle\u2019s Categories, for instance, we\nfind not only prolegomena suited for this very text (in seven points),\nbut also a general introduction to Aristotle\u2019s philosophy (in\nten points; for a useful overview see Hoffmann 2006: 607\u2013613).\nThis is because the Categories was the first of\nAristotle\u2019s texts to be read in the Neoplatonic school:\n\n\nSince the Categories is the first book of Aristotle\u2019s which we\nencounter, and Aristotle\u2019s school\u2014the so-called\nPeripatetic\u2014is one of the schools of philosophy, we ought first\nto say how and in how many ways the philosophical schools received\ntheir appellations. Secondly, what is the division of the Aristotelian\nwritings, so that the class to which we shall assign the present work\nshall be clear. Third, whence should one begin [the study of]\nAristotle\u2019s writings? Fourth, what is the goal of\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy? Fifth, which things lead us towards this\ngoal? Sixth, what is the form of the Aristotelian writings? Seventh,\nwhy did the Philosopher practise obscurity? Eighth, what must the\nexegete of accounts (logoi) such as these be like? Ninth,\nwhat kind of student should be accepted? Tenth, in the case of each\nAristotelian treatise, how many main points (kephalaia)\nshould be taken up, which are they, and for what reason? (Simplicius,\nIn Cat. 3.18\u201329, translated by M. Chase)\n\nFinally, the tenth of the matters set forth was: how many, and of what\nkind, are the preliminary points (kephalaia) we must\narticulate prior to the study of each Aristotelian treatise. They are\nthe following: the goal (skopos), the usefulness (to\nchr\u00easimon), the reason for the title (aitia\nepigraph\u00eas), its place in the order of reading (taxis\nanagn\u00f4se\u00f4s), whether the book is a genuine work of\nthe Philosopher (gn\u00easion), its division into chapters\n(eis kephalaia dihairesis). It may also not be inappropriate\nto inquire under what part of his philosophy (meros t\u00eas\nphilosophias) the work is placed. (Simplicius, In Cat.\n8.9\u201313, translated by M. Chase)\n\n\nSuch an introductory scheme could be modified according to the\nspecific needs and exigencies of a text, so that there is not always a\ndiscussion of all preliminary points:\n\n\nIt is to be noted, however, that all these things do not always\nrequire articulation, for often, the usefulness becomes clear at the\nsame time as the goal, while the title is obvious to everyone, as [in\nthe case of] the On the Soul. Authenticity, for its part,\ndoes not need to be established in every case, but in general only\nwhen there is some starting-point for controversy. (Simplicius, In\nCat. 8.31\u20139.3, translated by M. Chase)\n\n",
