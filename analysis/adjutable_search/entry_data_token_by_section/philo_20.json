    "main_text": "Transcendental Ethics || The sage, the divine man\n6. Conclusion\n\nAnother long article would be necessary to address the Christian\nreception of Philo. Many books and articles provide precious\ninformation on this point (Van den Hoek 1988; Runia 1993, 2009;\nSterling 1998). Philo\u2019s thought was used by the Christian\nfathers in many different ways. Their attitude towards him ranged from\nthe passionate interest of Origen to the accurate attention of Clemens\nto the somewhat stubborn and hostile attitude of Ambrose, who in many\nplaces plagiarizes Philo. Today, Philo is included in the modern\ncategories of \u201cMiddle Platonism\u201d and, still more recent,\n\u201cMiddle Judaism\u201d. In his case these expressions are\nmeaningful. He spent his life \u201cin the middle of\u201d\nantagonistic cultures, violent conflicts, and contrasting\nphilosophical and religious theories. His main legacy in philosophy\nwas the idea that in the face of many harsh human attitudes, there\nwere two complementary ways of remaining free and lucid. The main\nmodel was for him, as it was constantly asserted by Nikiprowetzky, the\nflight, not exactly the Platonic flight of the Theaetetus,\nbut that of Exodus, both a spatial, historical, and vertical flight,\nthe most perfect example of the presence of Transcendence in the\nworld. While the cause of Abraham\u2019s flight was his rejection of\nidolatry, Moses\u2019 project was far more ambitious: not only to\nescape from Egypt, but to build a nation by giving it the Word of God\nas a constitution. But it must be added that there was for Philo also\na kind of Exodus of words. He gathers concepts and themes of\nphilosophy to free them, i.e., to bring them into the light of the God\nof the Torah. Like Moses who knew all the foreign sciences, Philo\nlearned almost everything of philosophy, not in order to be a\nprofessional philosopher, but to demonstrate that the truth the Greeks\nlooked for was where they did not imagine it to be. Philo\u2019s\nconception of oudeneia, the human nothingness, had nothing to\ndo with nihilism. It was the affirmation of the centrality of God\ninstead of the centrality of the self. One could say that this was\ntheology much more than philosophy. But, at the same time, it would be\nan error to say that philosophy remained the same before and after\nPhilo. \nSupplementary Documents\n\nThe Meanings of Philosophy in Philo of Alexandria\nAbout the De aeternitate and the De providentia\nAbbreviations of the Philonian treatises (Studia Philonica Annual)\n\n",
