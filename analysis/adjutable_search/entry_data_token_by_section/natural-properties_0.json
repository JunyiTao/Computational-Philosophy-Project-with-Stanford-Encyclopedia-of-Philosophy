    "main_text": "Perfect naturalness and degrees of naturalness\n1. Perfect naturalness and degrees of naturalness\n\nNaturalness comes in degrees. But an important part of Lewis\u2019s\npicture, also dominant in the subsequent literature, is that it has a\nmaximal degree. Some properties are perfectly\nnatural. They are all equally natural, and no properties are more\nnatural than them. Lewis also calls these \u201cfundamental\u201d\nproperties. And the connotations of the word \u2018fundamental\u2019\nare apt. According to Lewis, there is a good sense in which one would\nhave exhaustively described the world if one said which\nthings (or \\(n\\)-tuples of things) instantiate each perfectly natural\nproperty, and in which one would have failed to exhaustively\ndescribe the world if one merely provided this information for some\nbut not all of the perfectly natural properties. As we will see in\n \u00a74.4,\n Lewis cashes out these thoughts in modal terms: all truths are\nnecessitated by the truths about the distribution of all\nperfectly natural properties, but not by the truths about the\ndistribution of only some of the perfectly natural properties. Others,\nlike Sider\n (2011),\n have explored quite different ways of cashing them out.\n\nGiving examples of perfectly natural properties is not supposed to be\neasy. Views that identify certain properties as perfectly natural are\nbold hypotheses about the fundamental structure of reality, and thus\nbound up with many central debates in metaphysics. According to Lewis,\nthe methods of physics have a central role to play in the project of\nidentifying the perfectly natural properties. Until we have the kind\nof final theory that many physicists are aiming for, we should not\nhope to be able to list the actually-instantiated perfectly natural\n properties.[2]\n But looking to physics in this way is already taking a stand on many\ncontroversial questions in philosophy. Those inclined towards dualism\nin the philosophy of mind (see the entries on\n dualism\n and\n physicalism)\n may hold that some mental properties\u2014for example,\nconsciousness, or specific phenomenal states, or relations like\nacquaintance, judgment or knowledge\u2014are perfectly natural;\nindeed, this might with some plausibility be regarded as definitive of\ndualism. Similarly, those inclined towards \u201cnon-naturalist\nrealism\u201d in metaethics (see the entry on\n moral non-naturalism)\n may hold that some normative or evaluative\nproperties, such as goodness, betterness, or moral permissibility, are\nperfectly natural.\n\nPerfect naturalness is generally understood to be definable in terms\nof relative naturalness: a property is perfectly natural just in case\nno property is more natural than it. But Lewis also held that relative\nnaturalness could be defined in terms of perfect naturalness: \\(F\\) is\nmore natural than \\(G\\) just in case \\(F\\) has a shorter and less\ncomplex definition in terms of perfectly natural properties than \\(G\\)\n(Lewis\n 1986b,\n 61). Here, a \u201cdefinition\u201d of a property can be understood\nas an expression referring to that property in a formal language which\nonly has simple predicates expressing perfectly natural properties (in\naddition to certain logical resources which allow complex predicates\nto be constructed out of these simple\n ones).[3]\n This claim has been controversial even among naturalness enthusiasts.\nOne influential worry (raised in Sider\n 1995)\n is that many of the properties we are interested in, and between\nwhich we need to draw distinctions of naturalness (e.g.\u00a0greenness\nand grueness), will only have infinite definitions in terms\nof the perfectly natural properties, so that they will all come out\nequally\n natural.[4]\n Nevertheless, length and complexity of definitions has been broadly\naccepted at least as a heuristic guide. For example, someone who held\nthat adjacency and chargedness were perfectly\nnatural would be expected to hold that being adjacent to something\ncharged is more natural than being adjacent to an uncharged\nthing that is adjacent to something charged.\n",
