What would be involved in providing a rock-bottom explanation\nfor this phenomenon, one that satisfied the precepts of methodological\nindividualism? How informative would this be? It does not take much\neffort to imagine what people are thinking, when they shake a baby or\nhit a toddler. The motives are all-too familiar \u2013 almost\neveryone experiences episodes of intense frustration or anger when\ndealing with children. But that clearly does not explain the\nphenomenon. The question is why one group systematically fails to\nexercise control over these violent impulses, relative to some other\ngroup. Since very few people do it as part of a well-conceived plan,\nit is not clear that there is going to be an explanation available at\nthe level of intentional states, or even that a complementary account\nof what is going on at this level will be in the least bit\ninformative. The problem is that the behavior is generated by biases\nthat function almost entirely at a subintentional level (Sperber,\n1997). This suggests that an explanation in terms of intentional\nstates is not really \u201crock bottom,\u201d but that there are\ndeeper layers to be explored.\n\n\nIt is not difficult to imagine how such an explanation might\nrun. People experience a reaction to juvenile (or neotenous)\ncharacteristics of the young that is largely involuntary. This\nreaction is very complex, but one of its central characteristics is\nthe inhibition of aggression. People are also quite poor at\narticulating the basis of this reaction, other than by repeated\nreferences to the fact that the child is \u201ccute.\u201d Of\ncourse, the overall strength of this reaction varies from individual\nto individual, and the particular strength varies with different\nchildren. Thus it is possible that biological parents simply find\ntheir own children \u201ccuter\u201d than stepparents do, and that\nthis translates into a slightly lower average propensity to commit\nacts of aggression against them. Because they are unable to articulate\nthe basis of this judgment, any analysis at the intentional level will\nsimply fail to provide much in the way of an explanation for their\nactions.\n\n\nFurthermore, it would seem that much \u201cdeeper\u201d explanations\nof these behavioral tendencies are available. Most obviously, there is\nan evolutionary account available, which explains parental investment\nin terms of inclusive fitness (and also explains \u201cnew mate\ninfanticide\u201d in terms of sexual selection).  Because of this,\nproponents of methodological individualism are open to the charge that\nthey are promoting half-way explanations, and that the evolutionary\nperspective offers rock-bottom ones. More generally, any theory that\npurports to explain the origin of our intentional states in terms of\ndeeper underlying causes, or that claims to explain much of human\nbehavior without reference to intentional states (such as Freudianism,\nwhich treats many of our beliefs as rationalizations, our desires as\nsublimations), will be unmoved by the methodological individualist\u2019s\ndemand that pride of place be assigned to explanations formulated at\nthe action-theoretic level.\n",
