    "main_text": "Criminal Responsibility\n5. Criminal Responsibility\n\n\nImagine that \\(D\\) takes \\(V\\)\u2019s property without \\(V\\)\u2019s consent.\nIs \\(D\\) criminally responsible for the taking? Not necessarily. In English\nlaw, \\(D\\) commits the offence of theft only if \\(D\\) acts dishonestly, and\nintends for \\(V\\) to be deprived of her property permanently. Theft\nis one of many offences commission of which depends on one\u2019s\nstate of mind. Elements of offences that require particular mental\nstates are known as mens rea elements. Other elements are\nknown as actus reus elements.\n\n\nSome claim that if \\(D\\) satisfies all elements of an offence\u2014if D\ncommits the actus reus with mens rea\u2014this\nsuffices to make \\(D\\) criminally responsible, but not to make D\ncriminally liable. Responsibility is understood here as\nanswerability (Duff 2007, 19\u201336). While we are answerable to the courts\nfor committing offences, we may avoid liability by offering\nsatisfactory answers in the form of defences. This account of criminal\nresponsibility\u2014call it the answerability\naccount\u2014relies on a distinction between offence and defence\nto which we will return. One argument for the answerability account\ninvokes rules of criminal procedure and evidence. To obtain a\nconviction, the prosecution must prove that \\(D\\) committed the offence\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. \\(D\\) can safely remain silent in the absence of\nsuch proof. If the prosecution makes its case, \\(D\\) has strong prudential\nreasons to prove a defence: without one, \\(D\\) will be convicted and\npunished. The best explanation of these rules, so the argument goes, is\nthat offending acts generate a duty to answer that is otherwise absent.\nThis duty explains why, when we have strong reason to believe \\(D\\) to be\nan offender, we put \\(D\\) under extra rational pressure to explain herself\nin court.\n\n\nSome think that, on closer inspection, our rules of procedure and\nevidence fail to support the answerability account, and help to\nundermine it. Those rules tell prosecutors to consider evidence\nboth that \\(D\\) committed an offence and that \\(D\\) lacks a\ndefence. If there is strong evidence that \\(D\\) killed in self-defence, D\nshould not be prosecuted. This matters here for the following reason.\nWhen prosecutors decide whether to prosecute, they are deciding whether\nD should be called to answer for what \\(D\\) did. The fact that prosecutors\nshould not prosecute if \\(D\\) clearly killed in self-defence,\nsuggests that those who have defences are not answerable in court. It\nsuggests that we owe the criminal courts answers not for acts that are\noffences but for acts that are crimes\u2014for\noffending acts which do not satisfy an available defence. Obviously\nenough, it is for crimes that we are criminally liable. If\nresponsibility is answerability, and we are answerable for crimes, the\nconditions of criminal responsibility and the conditions of criminal\nliability are one and the same. The answerability account, as described\nabove, then fails (Duarte d\u2019Almeida 2015, 239\u2013267).\n5.1 Mens Rea\n\n\nOn any view, the conditions under which \\(D\\) commits an offence are\nconditions of criminal responsibility. What should these conditions\nbe?  There has been much discussion of the mens rea principle\n(MR):\n\n(MR)\n\\(D\\) should be criminally responsible for\n  \\(\\phi\\)ing only if \\(\\phi\\)ing is partly constituted by an element\n  of mens rea.\n\n\n\nStandard mens rea requirements include intention and\nrecklessness. Paradigmatically, we intend \\(X\\) if, and only if, \\(X\\)\nis one of our reasons for acting: if, and only if, we act in order to\nbring \\(X\\) about. We are reckless about \\(X\\) if, and only if, (i) we\nare aware there is a risk of \\(X\\), and (ii) running the risk of which\nwe are aware is unjustified.\n\n\nWhether criminal responsibility should require mens rea, and\nwhat mens rea it should require, both depend on the reasons\nwe have to accept (MR). Perhaps the most familiar defence appeals\nto the culpability principle (C):\n\n(C)\n\\(D\\) should be criminally liable for \\(\\phi\\)ing only if \\(D\\)\n    is culpable for having \\(\\phi\\)ed.\n\n\n\nCulpability, as that term is used here, is a moral notion. It is\nsynonymous with moral fault or moral blameworthiness. Mens rea\nis not sufficient for culpability\u2014even intentional killings are\nsometimes excused. But it may well be necessary\u2014culpability may\npresuppose at least some element of mens rea (Simester 2013;\ncf. Gardner 2007, 227\u2013232). If this is so, the debate shifts to whether\nwe should accept (C). One worry about this principle is its generality.\nThe consequences of criminal liability are not always especially\nburdensome. And the benefits of liability without culpability may be\nespecially significant. To take but one example, think of regulations\nthat govern the activities of corporations, and which protect the\nhealth and safety of the public at large. Making it a criminal offence\nto violate these regulations, and imposing hefty fines, need have none\nof the destructive effects of imprisoning individuals. Dispensing with\nculpability requirements may increase the deterrent effects of the law,\nby making it harder for violators to escape conviction. Whether (C) is\nsound depends on whether effects like these\u2014which, ex\nhypothesi, protect the health and safety of many\u2014can justify\nimposing criminal liability without culpability.\n\n\nThat (C) may admit of exceptions does not, of course, show that (C)\nis not generally sound. I suggested above that, where (C) does apply,\nit entails (MR). How much mens rea (C) requires is a further\nquestion. Take the offence of causing death by dangerous driving. The\nactus reus of the crime requires two things: \\(D\\)\u2019s driving\nmust exhibit deficiencies that we reasonably expect a qualified driver\nto avoid, and those deficiencies must cause the death of another\nperson. Some think that (C) calls for two mens rea\nrequirements: \\(D\\) must have been aware of the deficiencies that made her\ndriving dangerous, and she must have been aware of a risk that they\nwould cause death. The idea that each actus reus element\nshould have a corresponding mens rea element is known as the\ncorrespondence principle (Ashworth 2008). Whether (C) in fact\nsupports that principle is a matter of debate. It is sometimes the case\nthat the risk of causing some harmful outcome (like death) helps make\nit the case that an act (like dangerous driving) is wrongful. There is\nan internal connection, in these cases, between our assessment of the\nact and the risk of the outcome. Some claim that where this internal\nconnection exists, \\(D\\)\u2019s awareness that she was engaged in the\nwrongful act establishes that she is culpable for the harmful\noutcome. If this is right, \\(D\\) need not have any mens rea as to\nthat outcome in order to be culpable for it when it occurs: the\ncorrespondence principle cannot be derived from (C) (Simester 2005,\n44\u201346; Duff 2005, 143\u2013147).\n\n\nA second defence of (MR) appeals to the rule of law (RL):\n\n(RL)\nthe law should be such that those to whom it applies can use its\n    norms to guide their conduct.\n\n\n\nConformity to (RL) is a matter of degree. But an especially high\ndegree of conformity is expected of the criminal law. One reason for\nthis is the special powers criminal law confers on \\(D\\)\u2019s accusers.\nAnother is the damage a guilty verdict does to the life of the accused.\nThe connection between (RL) and (MR) is clearly stated by Gardner:\n\n\nAccording to the ideal known as the rule of law, those of us about\nto commit a criminal wrong should be put on stark notice that that is\nwhat we are about to do. The criminal law should not ambush us\nunexpectedly. Of course, to avoid unexpected ambushes we all need to\nknow what the law requires of us. For that reason, criminal laws should\nbe clear, open, consistent, stable, and prospective. \u2026 Even all\nthis, however, is not enough to ensure that those of us about to\nviolate the criminal law are put on stark notice that we are about to\nviolate it. For we may know the law and yet have no grasp that what we\nare about to do might constitute a violation of it. That is because\noften we have no idea which actions we are about to perform. I make a\nlight-hearted remark and (surprise!) I offend one of my guests. I turn\non my oven and (surprise!) I blow all the fuses. The mens rea principle\nis the principle according to which such actions \u2013 the\nself-surprising ones \u2013 should not be criminal wrongs (Gardner\n2005, 69\u201370). \n\n\nIf \\(D\\) must be aware of those aspects of her actions that make them of\ninterest to the criminal law, she is less likely to be ambushed by\ncriminal offences that prohibit those actions. In this way, mens\nrea requirements contribute to personal autonomy by increasing our\nability to steer our lives away from criminal conviction and\npunishment. So (RL) supports (MR). Does it also support the\ncorrespondence principle? This is less clear. One view has it that\n\\(D\\)\u2019s awareness of the facts that made her driving dangerous\ndisqualifies \\(D\\) from complaining that she was ambushed by liability for\n\\(V\\)\u2019s death (at least as long as said liability was adequately\npublicized). On another view, \\(D\\)\u2019s autonomy not only counts in\nfavour of helping \\(D\\) to anticipate criminal liability, it also\ncounts in favour of helping \\(D\\) to anticipate its legal consequences,\nsuch that \\(D\\) can decide if the price of those consequences is worth\npaying (Hart 1968, 47; Ashworth 2008). If it does not occur to \\(D\\) that\n\\(\\phi\\)ing might cause death, it also does not occur to \\(D\\) that \\(\\phi\\)ing\nmight result in her suffering the additional punishment prescribed for\ncausing it. \\(D\\) is more likely to factor this information into her\ndecision-making if the criminal law insists that \\(D\\) is aware of the\nrisk\u2014if it insists on correspondence between actus reus\nand mens rea.\n\n\nA third argument for (MR) appeals to liberty (Simester and Chan\n2011, 393\u2013395). Consider an offence that prohibits damaging other\npeople\u2019s property. If the mens rea requirement is one of\nintent, \\(D\\) is free to knowingly take risks with \\(V\\)\u2019s possessions.\nIf the mens rea requires awareness, \\(D\\) is free to put \\(V\\)\u2019s\npossessions in harm\u2019s way without giving thought to the risks. If\nthere is no mens rea at all, no amount of care will help \\(D\\) if\nshe causes property to be damaged. These examples help show that\nmens rea requirements affect the range of options legally\navailable to \\(D\\). Obviously enough, the degree to which we should care\nabout taking options off the table depends on how much value they have.\nThis makes the liberty-protecting role of mens rea especially\nimportant where criminal responsibility extends beyond paradigmatic\ncases of wrongdoing. Consider the law of complicity. Under what\nconditions should S be criminally responsible for participating in\nwrongs committed by P? Imagine it is sufficient that S realises P might\nact wrongly. Anyone who sells goods that are liable to misuse is then\nin danger of being turned into a criminal by their customers.\nShopkeepers must run the gauntlet or close their doors. Narrower\nmens rea requirements enable them to both stay in business and\nensure they remain on the right side of the law (Simester 2006,\n591\u2013592).\n\n\nIt is worth concluding this section by returning to two questions\ndistinguished at its outset: (i) should criminal responsibility require\nmens rea? (ii) what mens rea should it require?\nQuestion (i) is often discussed under the heading of strict liability.\nThe literature distinguishes between various senses in which liability\ncan be strict (Duff 2005; Gardner 2005, 68\u201369; Simester 2005, 22\u201323).\nCriminal liability for \\(\\phi\\)ing is substantively strict if we\ncan \\(\\phi\\) without being culpable for \\(\\phi\\)ing. It is formally\nstrict if \\(\\phi\\)ing lacks elements of mens rea. This second category can\nitself be subdivided. Liability is formally strict in the strong\nsense when there is no mens rea element at all. Liability\nis formally strict in the weak sense when at least one\nactus reus element has no corresponding element of mens\nrea. If (C) is a sound principle, criminal liability should not be\nsubstantively strict. If (MR) is sound, there should be no criminal\nliability that is formally strict in the strong sense. If the\ncorrespondence principle is sound, liability that is formally strict in\nthe weak sense also should not exist.\n\n\nSo much for question (i). What about question (ii)? The above\ndiscussion assumed that mens rea at the very least requires\nawareness. But criminal liability sometimes turns not on what D\nnoticed, but on what \\(D\\) failed to notice\u2014on circumstances that\nwould have caused a reasonable person to refrain from doing what \\(D\\) did.\nIt is where such circumstances exist that \\(D\\)\u2019s actions are\nnegligent. Some writers claim that negligence has no place in criminal\nlaw. If (C) is sound, and culpability requires awareness, then criminal\nliability should require recklessness at the very least. Others take a\ndifferent view. They claim that when we are unaware of risks because of\nvices like arrogance or indifference, this makes us culpable\nfor running those risks. So (C) is compatible with at least some\ninstances of negligence liability in criminal law (Hart 1968, 136\u2013157;\nSimester 2000, Alexander and Ferzan 2009, 69\u201385; Moore and Hurd\n2011).\n5.2 Actus Reus\n\n\nWhether or not mens rea should be necessary for criminal\nresponsibility, it is rarely claimed that it should be sufficient. The\nwidespread belief that we should not countenance thought crimes, leads\nmost writers to claim that there should be an actus reus\nelement to each criminal offence. Paradigmatically, this element is\nsatisfied only if \\(D\\) acts in a way that causes some outcome, such\nas death, or property damage, or fear of violence. This paradigm does,\nof course, admit of a number of exceptions. As well as inchoate\noffences\u2014like attempts or conspiracies\u2014most systems of\ncriminal law include liability for some omissions. Imagine \\(D\\) sees\n\\(V\\) drowning in a shallow pond and chooses to do nothing. There is\nno prior connection between \\(D\\) and \\(V\\). If the pond is in London,\n\\(D\\) commits no offence. Move the drama to Paris and we have\nourselves a crime. As this example suggests, both academics and legal\nsystems remain divided over the positive obligations that should be\nimposed by criminal law (Alexander 2002; Ashworth 2015).\n\n\nExceptions aside, the building blocks of our paradigm are each open\nto interpretation. Consider, for instance, the need for causation. Is\nthe conclusion that \\(D\\) caused \\(V\\)\u2019s death a matter of physical\nfact\u2014something that is, in Hume\u2019s well-known phrase, part\nof the cement of the universe? Or do the rules of causation\u2014at\nleast in criminal law\u2014lie downstream of moral judgments about the\nfair attribution of responsibility? Does the truth, perhaps, lie\nsomewhere in between? (Hart and Honor\u00e9 1959; Moore 2009b;\nSimester 2017). The criminal liability of many\u2014as well as the\npunishments they face\u2014turns on the answer we give to such\nquestions.\n\n\nAcademic debate about causation and omissions largely takes our\nparadigm for granted. Some writers, however, take a more radical view:\nthey favour a paradigm shift in our thinking about criminal\nresponsibility. One group of radicals focuses on outcomes. Imagine D\nshoots at \\(V\\), intending to cause death. In any system of criminal law\nthis is an attempt. The radicals claim that what happens next should\nmake no difference: \\(D\\) should be convicted of the same crime whether or\nnot \\(V\\) is killed. Criminal responsibility, in short, should be\ninsensitive to the outcomes of what we do (Ashworth 1993; Alexander and\nFerzan 2009, 171\u2013196). Consider again what I earlier called (C):\n\n(C)\n\\(D\\) should be criminally liable for \\(\\phi\\)ing only if \\(D\\) is\n    culpable for having \\(\\phi\\)ed.\n\n\n\nIf this principle is sound, we can offer the following argument:\n\n(1)\nWe are culpable only for what is within our control;\n(2)\nThere are always factors that bear on the outcomes of our\n                      actions that we do not control;\n                      \n\u2234(3)\nWe should not be criminally responsible\n    for outcomes.\n\n\n\nThis argument relies on the following suppressed premise:\n\n(2\\('\\))\nWe only control\n    \\(X\\) if there is no factor that bears on \\(X\\) that we do not\n    control.\n\n\n\nIt is only if (2\\('\\)) is true that we never control outcomes.\nAlas, (2\\('\\)) has unpalatable implications. Uncontrolled factors do\nnot only bear on whether we succeed. They also bear on whether we try,\non the choices we make, and on the character traits that influence our\nchoices. (2\\('\\)) implies that we are never culpable for any of these\nthings\u2014for our successes, our endeavours, our choices or our\ncharacter. Pursued to its logical conclusion, it implies that we are\nnever culpable for anything (Nagel 1979; Moore 1997, 233\u2013246). If, as\nmost people believe, we sometimes are culpable for what we do,\n(2\\('\\)) must be false. We can add that (3) radically understates the\nconclusion of the argument offered above. When combined with (C), that\nargument does not imply that we should not be criminally responsible\nfor outcomes. It implies that no one should ever be criminally\nresponsible.\n\n\nWe might try to salvage the argument from (1)\u2013(3) by revising our\naccount of control:\n\n(2\\(''\\))\nWe control\n    \\(X\\) if we have a reasonable chance of preventing \\(X\\) or\n    bringing \\(X\\) about.\n\n\n\nThis revision avoids the unpalatable implications of (2\\('\\)). But\nit also renders the argument from (1)\u2013(3) invalid. If (2\\(''\\))\nstates the correct account of control, we do sometimes have\ncontrol over outcomes. Imagine \\(D\\) holds a loaded gun to \\(V\\)\u2019s head\nand pulls the trigger. \\(D\\) has a reasonable chance\u2014indeed, an\nextremely high chance\u2014of killing \\(V\\). On this account of control,\n(1) and (2) do not support (3): they give us no reason to accept that\nwe are never criminally responsible for outcomes (Moore 2009,\n24\u201326).\n5.3 Defences\n\n\nWe have already seen that, for some, we are criminally responsible\nfor committing offences and criminally liable for committing\ncrimes. This distinction relies on a further distinction\nbetween offences and defences: crimes are committed by those who\nsatisfy all the elements of an offence, without satisfying all the\nelements of any available defence.\n\n\nOne account of the offence/defence distinction is\nprocedural. Offence elements must be proved if conviction is\nto be the legally correct verdict of the court. So if absence of\nconsent is an offence-element\u2014as it is in the offences created,\nin England and Wales, by the Sexual Offences Act 2003\u2014it must be\nproved that consent was absent or \\(D\\) must be acquitted. The same is not\ntrue of defence elements, like those that make up the defence of\nduress. For a conviction to be correctly entered, it need not be proved\nthat \\(D\\) did not act under duress. It is enough that there is no evidence\nthat \\(D\\) acted under duress. The same is true where consent is a\ndefence-element\u2014as it is in the offences created, in England and\nWales, by the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. If \\(D\\) punches \\(V\\) and\nis charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the court need\nnot be convinced that \\(V\\) did not consent. If the issue of consent never\ncomes up, a conviction may still be the legally correct verdict of the\ncourt. Simply put, that \\(D\\) satisfied each offence element is something\nthat must be proved. Whether \\(D\\) satisfied each defence element can\nremain uncertain. It is in this procedural distinction, on the view\nunder consideration, that the offence/defence distinction consists\n(Duarte d\u2019Almeida 2015).\n\n\nThis last claim is denied by those who believe that the\noffence/defence distinction is substantive. These writers\naccept that offences and defences are governed by different procedural\nrules. Their claim is that the distinction between offences and\ndefences explains why those rules differ. Perhaps the most\nwell-known version of this view runs as follows. Offence elements are\nindividually necessary, and jointly sufficient, to describe an act\nthat there is general reason not to perform. Defence elements block\nthe transition from the existence of that reason to the conclusion\nthat \\(D\\) ought to be convicted of a crime. On this view, whether we\nshould think of the absence of consent as an element of the offence of\nsexual assault, depends on whether we think that there is a general\nreason not to have consensual sex with others. If there is no such\nreason, the absence of consent is necessary to give us an act we have\ngeneral reason not to perform. So it is an element of the offence of\nsexual assault. If, on the other hand, there is a general\nreason not to have consensual sex, consent is properly thought of as a\ndefence to sexual assault (Campbell 1987; Gardner 2007,\n144\u2013149).\n\n\nIn addition to distinguishing between offences and defences, many\nwriters distinguish between types of criminal defence. The most\nfamiliar distinction is between justifications and excuses. The most\nfamiliar account of the distinction has it that while justified actors\ndeny wrongdoing, excused actors deny either responsibility or\nculpability (Austin 1956; Fletcher 1978; Greenawalt 1984; Baron 2005).\nTwo questions are worth asking here. Is the familiar distinction worth\ndrawing? If so, is the familiar account of the distinction the right\nway to draw it?\n\n\nThere are two reasons to answer the first question in the\naffirmative. One invokes (C). If courts are to develop criminal\ndefences so that their contours track culpability, they need to know\nwhy each defence makes it the case that those who plead it are\nnot culpable. Is there a defence of necessity because we sometimes do\nthe right thing by choosing the lesser of two evils? Or does the\ndefence exist because actors sometimes make wrongful choices under\nenormous pressure, and because there is sometimes nothing culpable\nabout giving into the pressure? How courts should develop the defence\ndepends on how they answer these questions. It depends on whether they\nconceive of the defence as a justification or an excuse.\n\n\nA second reason to make the familiar distinction invokes the idea\nthat criminal trials call defendants to account. On this view, trials\nare in one way continuous with life outside the law\u2014they\ninstitutionalize our ordinary moral practice of making and replying to\naccusations (Gardner 2007, 177\u2013200; Duff, 2010c; 2011; 2013a). When\naccused of wrongdoing in our everyday lives, most of us do not only\ncare about whether we end up being blamed. Where we did nothing wrong,\nwe try to convince our accusers that this is the case: it matters to us\nthat others not add wrongs to the story of our lives, even if we know\nthat they will otherwise conclude that we acted blamelessly. There is\nno reason to think that things are different in criminal courts: that\nthose accused of crime should, or do, care only about getting off the\nhook. By retaining distinct justificatory and excusatory defences, the\ncriminal law gives effect to our interests in presenting\nourselves\u2014to our accusers and to others\u2014in the best\navailable rational light (Gardner 2007, 133).\n\n\nLet us turn, then, to the second of our questions. Is it true that\njustifications deny wrongdoing? Is it true that excuses deny\nresponsibility? Some think both questions should at least sometimes be\nanswered in the negative. True, those who act in self-defence\nplausibly benefit from an exception to the duty not to harm\nothers. Having placed \\(D\\) under attack, many think, \\(V\\) has no\nright that \\(D\\) not use necessary and proportionate force against\n\\(V\\) (McMahan 2005). But the same is not true when \\(D\\) harms an\ninnocent bystander, even if this is the only way to prevent even\ngreater harm to others. \\(V\\)\u2019s right remains, it is often\nthought, but is sometimes overridden. So \\(D\\) still wrongs\n\\(V\\). That wrong is justified when and because \\(D\\) has undefeated\nreasons to commit it\u2014reasons given by the greater harm prevented\nby \\(D\\). If this is right, those who plead a justification do not\nalways deny, but sometimes concede, wrongdoing. It is the wrong that\nthey then try to justify (Gardner 2007, 77\u201382).\n\n\nThe familiar account might be thought to be on firmer ground when it\ncomes to excuses. Grant that to plead an excuse is indeed to deny\nculpability. The same is true of a justification. So there is nothing\nhere to distinguish the two. Do excuses, then, deny responsibility? At\nleast sometimes, they do not. True, those who plead insanity deny that\nthey were capable of responding to reasons when they acted. But this\nis not true of other excusatory pleas. Imagine \\(T\\) bursts into\n\\(D\\)\u2019s house and threatens to shoot \\(D\\) unless \\(D\\) shoots\n\\(V\\). If \\(D\\) pleads duress, \\(D\\) relies on the fact that her capacity\nto respond to reasons remained intact: her plea is that she\noffended in order to avoid the harm threatened by \\(T\\), and in\ndoing so lived up to our reasonable expectations. \\(D\\) thereby\nasserts rather than denies responsibility for an offending act\n(Gardner 2007, 82\u201387). This does not mean that duress is a\njustification. \\(V\\)\u2019s right to life defeats the reasons \\(D\\)\nhas to save her own. \\(D\\) has a defence because we do not expect any\nmore from someone in \\(D\\)\u2019s predicament\u2014because we can\nunderstand why saving her own life seemed a good enough reason to\n\\(D\\) (Simester 2012, 105).\n\n\nTwo points emerge from these remarks. One is that the familiar account\nof the justification/excuse distinction should be rejected. The second\nis that a bipartite classification of criminal defences obscures\ndistinctions we have reason to make. Some respond by distinguishing\ndenials of responsibility (like insanity) from excuses (like duress),\nand distinguishing both from justifications (like self-defence and\nnecessity). Excuses and justifications, so understood, are\nboth assertions of responsibility and denials of\nculpability. Justified actors have undefeated reasons for their\nactions. Excused actors live up to reasonable expectations despite\nlacking such reasons (Gardner 2007, 91\u2013139; Simester 2012, 99\u2013108).\nThough this tripartite classification is an improvement, some maintain\nthat further distinctions should be drawn (Duff 2007, 263\u2013298; Simester\n2012). Just how numerous the categories of criminal defence are (or\nought to be) is a topic for future work.\n",
