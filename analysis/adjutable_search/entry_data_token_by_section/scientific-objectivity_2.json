    "main_text": "Objectivity as Faithfulness to Facts || The View From Nowhere\n2.1 The View From Nowhere\n\nHumans experience the world from a perspective. The contents of an\nindividual\u2019s experiences vary greatly with his perspective,\nwhich is affected by his personal situation, and the details of his\nperceptual apparatus, language and culture. While the experiences\nvary, there seems to be something that remains constant. The\nappearance of a tree will change as one approaches it\nbut\u2014according to common sense and most philosophers\u2014the\ntree itself doesn\u2019t. A room may feel hot or cold for different\npersons, but its temperature is independent of their experiences. The\nobject in front of me does not disappear just because the lights are\nturned off.\n\nThese examples motivate a distinction between qualities that vary with\none\u2019s perspective, and qualities that remain constant through\nchanges of perspective. The latter are the objective qualities. Thomas\nNagel explains that we arrive at the idea of objective qualities in\nthree steps (Nagel 1986: 14). The first step is to realize (or\npostulate) that our perceptions are caused by the actions of things\naround us, through their effects on our bodies. The second step is to\nrealize (or postulate) that since the same qualities that cause\nperceptions in us also have effects on other things and can exist\nwithout causing any perceptions at all, their true nature must be\ndetachable from their perspectival appearance and need not resemble\nit. The final step is to form a conception of that \u201ctrue\nnature\u201d independently of any perspective. Nagel calls that\nconception the \u201cview from nowhere\u201d, Bernard Williams the\n\u201cabsolute conception\u201d (Williams 1985 [2011]). It\nrepresents the world as it is, unmediated by human minds and other\n\u201cdistortions\u201d.\n\nThis absolute conception lies at the basis of scientific realism (for\na detailed discussion, see the entry on\n scientific realism)\n and it is attractive in so far as it provides a basis for arbitrating\nbetween conflicting viewpoints (e.g., two different observations).\nMoreover, the absolute conception provides a simple and unified\naccount of the world. Theories of trees will be very hard to come by\nif they use predicates such as \u201cheight as seen by an\nobserver\u201d and a hodgepodge if their predicates track the habits\nof ordinary language users rather than the properties of the world. To\nthe extent, then, that science aims to provide explanations for\nnatural phenomena, casting them in terms of the absolute conception\nwould help to realize this aim. A scientific account cast in the\nlanguage of the absolute conception may not only be able to explain\nwhy a tree is as tall as it is but also why we see it in one way when\nviewed from one standpoint and in a different way when viewed from\nanother. As Williams (1985 [2011: 139]) puts it,\n\n\n[the absolute conception] nonvacuously explain[s] how it itself, and\nthe various perspectival views of the world, are possible.\n\n\nA third reason to find the view from nowhere attractive is that if the\nworld came in structures as characterized by it and we did have access\nto it, we could use our knowledge of it to ground predictions (which,\nto the extent that our theories do track the absolute structures, will\nbe borne out). A fourth and related reason is that attempts to\nmanipulate and control phenomena can similarly be grounded in our\nknowledge of these structures. To attain any of the four\npurposes\u2014settling disagreements, explaining the world,\npredicting phenomena, and manipulation and control\u2014the absolute\nconception is at best sufficient but not necessary. We can, for\ninstance, settle disagreements by imposing the rule that the person\nwith higher social rank or greater experience is always right. We can\nexplain the world and our image of it by means of theories that do not\nrepresent absolute structures and properties, and there is no need to\nget things (absolutely) right in order to predict successfully.\nNevertheless, there is something appealing in the idea that factual\ndisagreements can be settled by the very facts themselves, that\nexplanations and predictions grounded in what\u2019s really there\nrather than in a distorted image of it.\n\nNo matter how desirable, our ability to use scientific claims to\nrepresent facts about the world depends on whether these claims can\nunambiguously be established on the basis of evidence, and of evidence\nalone. Alas, the relation between evidence and scientific hypothesis\nis not straightforward.\n Subsection 2.2\n and\n subsection 2.3\n will look at two challenges of the idea that even the best scientific\nmethod will yield claims that describe an aperspectival view from\nnowhere.\n Section 5.2\n will deal with socially motivated criticisms of the view from\nnowhere.\n",
