We\ndenote it by \\(\\bPML\\). This logic has some interest in Computer\nScience.\n\nThe logic \\(\\bPML\\) is not protoalgebraic, it is not truth-equational,\nit is selfextensional and it is not Fregean. Its algebraic counterpart\n\\(\\bAlg \\bPML\\) is the class of positive modal algebras introduced by\nDunn in Dunn 1995. The logic is studied in Jansana 2002 from the\nperspective of abstract algebraic logic. The class of algebras\n\\(\\bAlg\\bPML\\) is different from \\(\\bAlg^*\\bPML\\).\n",
