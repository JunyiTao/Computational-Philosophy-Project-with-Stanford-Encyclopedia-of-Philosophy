    "main_text": "Modern Aesthetics and the Problem of Erotic Art\n2. Modern Aesthetics and the Problem of Erotic Art \n\nAre there \u00fcberhaupt any works of erotic art? This may\nseem a silly question, especially to anyone who is familiar with art\nhistory and with the well-established tradition of erotic art in\nparticular. But to students of modern aesthetics, that is, the\nphilosophy of art and beauty from roughly the beginning of the\n18th century to the end of the 19th century,\nthat question will not appear absurd at all.\n",
