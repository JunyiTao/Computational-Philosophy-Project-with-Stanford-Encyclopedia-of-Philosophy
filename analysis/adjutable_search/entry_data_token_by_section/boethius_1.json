    "main_text": "The Logical Project and the Logical Commentaries\n2. The Logical Project and the Logical Commentaries\n\nBoethius\u2019s work as a translator and commentator of Aristotelian\nlogic might appear to be just the beginning of a wider project,\nannounced in the second commentary on On Interpretation (c.\n516), and cut short by his execution, to translate and comment on all\nthe writings of Plato and Aristotle. Yet Boethius seems to have become\nso engrossed in his role as an expositor of logic, not limiting\nhimself to a single commentary on each work, and writing extra\ntextbooks, that it is hard not to see it as having diverted him, in\nany case, from his more grandiose scheme. Indeed, Boethius seems to\nhave pursued a rather special logical project.\n\nThe particular, deliberate nature of this project is not cast into\ndoubt by the fact that Boethius\u2019s logical commentaries, although\nalmost certainly not merely servile translations of marginalia from a\nGreek manuscript (as James Shiel (1990) has argued), are not at all\noriginal in their logical doctrines. For what is important is\nBoethius\u2019s choice of Porphyry as his main authority in logic. It\nwas Porphyry who, two centuries or so earlier, had been responsible\nfor making Aristotelian logic an important subject within the\nNeoplatonic curriculum. He held that it did not conflict with Platonic\ndoctrine, as his teacher Plotinus had believed, because its area of\napplication was limited to the sensible world, to which everyday\nlanguage refers. Later Neoplatonists accepted the importance of\nAristotelian logic, and the harmony between Platonic and Aristotelian\nteaching, but they tended to try and discover Neoplatonic doctrines\neven in the Aristotelian logical texts. In the case of the\nCategories, they even imagined that Aristotle had taken his\ndoctrine from a Pythagorean writer, Archytas, and that there was an\nunderlying and wildly metaphysical strand to the text which it was the\ncommentator\u2019s duty to uncover. Boethius, however, although\nmaking occasional use of later commentaries, usually followed\nPorphyry: on the Categories he stayed close to\nPorphyry\u2019s surviving (and quite simple) question-and-answer\ncommentary, whilst the long, second commentary on On\nInterpretation is commonly accepted as the best guide to\nPorphyry\u2019s exegesis, since his own commentary does not survive.\nBoethius\u2019s commentaries were, therefore, because more\nPorphyrian, so more Aristotelian than what was being written in Greek\nin his period.\n\nBoethius\u2019s Porphyrian approach is evident even in the two\ncommentaries on Porphyry\u2019s own Isagoge (an introduction\nto the Categories which had become accepted as a standard\npart of the logical curriculum)\u2014one text on which, obviously,\nPorphyry himself had never commented. Near the beginning of the\nIsagoge, Porphyry mentions three questions about universals,\nbut declines to discuss them in an introductory work. Do they exist or\nare they mere concepts? If they exist are they bodily or not, and, if\nthey are not, are they separated from sensible things or do they exist\nin them? By Boethius\u2019s time, the Greek commentators had\ndeveloped a standard way of glossing this passage. They explained that\nuniversals could be considered as concepts (universals post\nrem\u2014\u2018following the thing\u2019), as intrinsic to\nbodily things (universals in re\u2014\u2018in the\nthing\u2019) and as really existing and separate from bodies\n(universals ante rem\u2014\u2018before the thing\u2019).\nIn most of his work, Boethius follows this way of thinking about\nuniversals (cf. Cross 2012). But here he takes a different approach,\nturning to a train of thought (1906, 161:14 ff.) which goes back in\npart to Porphyry himself and, through him, to the great Aristotelian,\nAlexander of Aphrodisias.\n\nBoethius begins with an argument against universals as an object of\nenquiry. Everything that really exists is one in number, but nothing\nthat is common to many at the same time can be one in number. But\nuniversals are common to many at the same time. And so\nuniversals do not exist in reality, but in thought alone. Thoughts,\nBoethius continues, are of two sorts: those which derive from their\nobject in the way it is (call them \u2018corresponding\nthoughts\u2019) and those which do not. If the thoughts that are\nuniversals were corresponding thoughts, then universals would also\nexist in reality. Since they do not, universals are non-corresponding\nthoughts, and non-corresponding thoughts are empty. Enquiry into\nuniversals (and therefore into the five predicables studied in the\nIsagoge) should therefore be abandoned. Boethius\u2019s way\nof tackling this objection is to challenge just the very final stage.\nNon-corresponding thoughts, he argues, are not empty if they are\nabstractions. Consider a mathematical object such as a line or a\npoint, which the mathematician contemplates by abstracting from the\nmaterial body of which it is part. No such thing exists in reality as\nan immaterial line or point, and yet the mathematician\u2019s thought\nis not empty or misleading. The case is similar if we disregard the\naccidental features of some particular thing (John Marenbon, for\ninstance) and are left just with his nature of man. This line of\nreply, as Alain de Libera (1999, 159\u2013280) has shown, goes back\nto Alexander of Aphrodisias or his followers. Boethius, however, goes\non to give it his own particular twist, by suggesting that the\nuniversals produced by abstraction are not merely the constructions of\nthe mind, but do grasp reality as it is. Although this line fits oddly\nwith the argument from which Boethius set out, he may already be\nanticipating the Principle of Modes of Cognition, which he proposes in\nthe Consolation (see\n Section 6\n below).\n\nThe long, second commentary on On Interpretation is very\nprobably based, as explained above, on Porphyry\u2019s lost\ncommentary. It thus provides a full account of Porphyry\u2019s\nsemantics\u2014a semantics based on Aristotle, because he takes\nordinary language to be concerned with material things rather than\nwith the intelligible world. There is also an extended discussion of\nthe sea-battle passage in Chapter 9. According to the principle of\nbivalence, \u2018There will be a sea-battle tomorrow\u2019 is either\ntrue or false. But, if it is true, then there will be a\nsea-battle tomorrow; if false, there will not be one. Either\nway, is it not therefore a matter of necessity? Boethius\u2019s\nstrategy is to say that \u2018There will be a sea-battle\ntomorrow\u2019 is indeed either true or false, but, because the\nsea-battle is a contingent event, its truth or falsehood is only\nindefinite. What does this position amount to? There are various\ninterpretations of how it should be understood. Perhaps the most\nplausible is that Boethius holds that, if an event e is\ncontingent, then the sentence \u2018e will take place\u2019\nis false, even if it turns out that e does in fact happen,\nbecause \u2018e will take place\u2019 implies that\ne will take place necessarily. But a qualified sentence such\nas \u2018e will take place contingently\u2019 is true just\nin case it is not necessary that e happens, and e\nactually happens.\n",
