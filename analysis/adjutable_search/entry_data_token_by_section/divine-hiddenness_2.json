    "main_text": "Attempts to explain nonresistant nonbelief theistically\n3. Attempts to explain nonresistant nonbelief theistically\n\nIt follows from Schellenberg\u2019s premises\n (4)\u2013(6)\n that, necessarily, if God exists, then, for any capable finite person\nS and time t, it is not the case that S is\nat t nonresistantly in a state of nonbelief in relation to\nthe proposition that God exists. In short, God\u2019s existence\nentails there\u2019s never any nonresistant nonbelief. To assess this\nimplication we must assess the premises from which it follows. In this\nsection, we focus on premise\n (5)\n and a particular kind of assessment, something analogous to theodicy\nin the literature on the problem of evil. To help us keep our focus,\nsuppose we grant premises\n (4)\n and\n (6).\n Moreover, since we want to assess premise\n (5)\n from as sympathetic a position as we can, suppose we grant\nSchellenberg\u2019s claim that one is open to a positively\nmeaningful, reciprocal, and conscious relationship with another, in a\nmanner consistent with perfect love, only if one never does anything\n(by commission or omission) that would result in the other being\nprevented from participating in that relationship, just by trying.\nGiven these suppositions, we might wonder whether it is possible that\nGod perfectly loves such finite persons as there may be and yet, for\nat least some of them, God does something (by commission or omission)\nthat results in them lacking belief in God\u2019s\nexistence\u2014even though they have the capacity for a positively\nmeaningful and reciprocal conscious relationship with God and they are\nnot in a state of resistance to God. In particular, we might wonder\nwhether there are any reasons for a perfectly loving God to\ndo something (by commission or omission) that would result in\nnonresistant nonbelief in persons who are capable of relating\npersonally with God in this way.\n\nThere are many cases of this type to wonder about. Here are two.\nFirst, imagine someone who has always lacked belief and who has always\nlacked the capacity to relate personally with God but who is,\nnonetheless, nonresistant to God. Such a person might be a child who\nis at the dawn of her capacity to relate personally with God. Might\nthere be good enough reason, consistent with perfect love, for God to\ndo something (by commission or omission) that results in her being\nprevented from belief, even as she transitions to being capable of\nrelating personally with God while remaining nonresistant? Second,\nimagine a man who has had the capacity to relate personally with God\nfor some time, and who was once a fulfilled nonresistant believer but\nwho, for one reason or another, is now in a state of resistant\nnonbelief. Many a university student might satisfy this description,\namong others. Might there be good enough reason, consistent with\nperfect love, for God to do something (by commission or omission) that\nresults in that man being prevented from belief in God\u2019s\nexistence even as, later in life, he transitions back to being\nnonresistant?\n\nAffirmative answers to these questions involve reasons for thinking it\nwould be better if they remained nonbelievers, at least for a time,\ndespite their transitions. For example, what if the child never ever\nexercised any influence over whether she was nonresistant to God?\nPerhaps, in that case, it would be better\u2014for her, and for God,\nand for their forthcoming relationship\u2014if she were first to own\nher good disposition toward God through choices in the face of\ncontrary inclinations, so that, among other things, her loving and\nobeying God was of her own accord when she came to believe. Or perhaps\nher non-resistance to God is grounded in improper motives, e.g., fear\nof punishment, a desire for parental approval or social acceptance,\nand the like, and so God gives her the opportunity to change her\nmotives so that, upon coming to believe, her love and obedience are\nmore properly motivated (Howard-Snyder 1996a, 2015; cf. Schellenberg\n2017a). Or perhaps her moral autonomy, freedom, or moral development\nwould be objectionably thwarted or reduced if God were to bring her to\nbelief at this time (Hick 1966; Murray 2002; Paytas 2017, 2019;\nSwinburne 1979). Or perhaps, despite her non-resistance, if she came\nto belief now instead of later, the passion and intensity of her\ndesire for God would be significantly less than it otherwise would be.\nOr perhaps she is disposed, upon coming to believe now, to think she\nhas arrived at a proper understanding of God, and she would become\ncomplacent or relate to God at a superficial level. (Kierkegaard 1844:\n28\u201329, 33\u201335; cf. Schellenberg 1993: 160ff). Or perhaps\ncertain intellectual temptations would be lost on her if she were to\nbelieve now, and so she would not have the opportunity to respond to\nthem virtuously (Butler 1736: part 2, chapter 6; cf. Schellenberg\n1993: 168ff). Or perhaps upon coming to believe now, she would be\nresentful or envious of God\u2019s glory and greatness (Dumsday\n2012a). Or what if the university student, despite his forthcoming\nreturn to non-resistance, was disposed to relate to God in\npresumptuous or arrogant ways upon regaining belief, and not with due\ncontrition and humility, both of which are essential to a proper\nrelationship with God? Or what if he was disposed to be significantly\nless apt to recognize the wretchedness of living life on his own,\nwithout God, if he were to regain belief now instead of later? (Pascal\n1670, Fragments 234, 378, 427, 446, 449; cf. Schellenberg 1993:\n136ff). Or what if God does not bring him to belief because he is\nill-disposed to the sort of moral transformation God intends for him,\nor he\u2019s into having a relationship with God just for the\npleasure and titillation of it? (Dumsday 2014b; Moser 2002, 2008b) Or\nwhat if God does not bring him to belief because, as a general policy,\nGod permits some people in positions like his to continue in nonbelief\nin order to increase diverse expressions of religious imagination,\ncreativity, and devotion, or in order to increase opportunities for\npeople to pursue knowledge of important matters together, even\nknowledge as important as knowledge of God, or in order to promote\nassisting each other in starting personal relationships with God\n(Dumsday 2010b; Schellenberg 1993: 181ff; Swinburne 1998); or because,\nunder present circumstances, bringing all non-resistant believers to\nbelief would force the truth of theism on the resistant (Dumsday\n2016a)? And there are other explanations offered as well.\n\nSeveral points have emerged in the literature with respect to\nassessing these reasons or explanations.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s doubtful that any single one of them offers a total\nexplanation of nonresistant nonbelief. Different kinds of nonresistant\nnonbelievers, given the rest of their psychology, might call for\ndifferent explanations. Moreover, each of these explanations, taken\nalone, might fail to provide a total explanation of any particular\nkind or instance of nonresistant nonbelief, and yet each of them might\nprovide a partial explanation and, taken together with others, add up\nto a total explanation. At least this is a possibility that must not\nbe overlooked. Thus, if we are to reject these explanations, and\nothers that might be proffered, we must claim that they fail,\ncollectively as well as individually, to account for why God might\npermit nonresistant nonbelief.\n\nSecond, in light of the foregoing point, even if there are some\nnonresistant nonbelievers, it may well be quite difficult to discern\nwhether they possess or fail to possess those motivations, attitudes,\nand dispositions that allegedly explain their nonbelief in a\ntheistically friendly fashion. If the difficulty is severe enough,\nthen it might be that no one\u2014whether theists, atheists,\nagnostics, or what-have-you\u2014is well-positioned to say that there\nare some nonresistant nonbelievers.\n\nOf course\u2014and this is the third point\u2014we might well argue\nthat these explanations provide no good reason, individually or\ncollectively, for God to permit nonresistant nonbelief. That\u2019s\nbecause the good states of affairs to which they appeal can be\naccommodated within a developing, positively meaningful, reciprocal,\nand conscious relationship with God, or because the benefits of such a\nrelationship with God exceed the goods to which these explanations\nappeal, or because, more generally, this sort of relationship with God\nis the greatest good and so God wouldn\u2019t pursue lesser goods at\nits expense (Bozzo 2019; Howard-Snyder and Moser 2002a; Schellenberg\n1993, 1996, 2005a, 2005b, 2007a, 2015a, 2017a; McBrayer and Swenson\n2012; Teeninga 2017, 2019, 2020; Trakakis 2007a).\n\nFourth, one might worry that the whole enterprise of providing a\ntheistically friendly explanation of nonresistant nonbelief is\nmisguided. After all, if God exists, why didn\u2019t God create a\nworld in which there never was or ever will be any nonresistant\nnonbelief? Why would God create or permit resisters and nonbelievers\nin the first place? Surely he could have created persons who never\nresisted and always believed.\n",
