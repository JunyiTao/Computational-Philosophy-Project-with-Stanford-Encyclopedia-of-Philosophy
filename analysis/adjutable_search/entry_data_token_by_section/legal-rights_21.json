Plausible examples are the legal rights\nto life, bodily integrity, autonomy, and freedom, which are arguably\ngrounded in those values to right-holders (Raz 1994: 48\u201349). The\nsame seems true of certain social rights, such as the right to\nadequate healthcare or to minimum wage. In fact, often the moral value\nof a right vis-\u00e0-vis the right-holder justifies the\nright, even when in conflict with the interests of others or with the\ncommon good. \n\nYet, this is not always the case. First, as intimated above\n (Section 5.2),\n even if rights always in some sense entitle or are in some way for\nright-holders, it does not necessarily follow that this value to\nright-holders has any intrinsic justificatory force in favor of the\nright (even if it often does). For instance, groups, corporations, or\nindividuals in their capacity as public officials have a will and\ninterests, as well as hold-rights protective of them. Yet, such will\nor interests are not of intrinsic moral value and, therefore, do not\nhave intrinsic justificatory force in favor of their protection.\nMoreover, arguably legal rights can protect right-holders\u2019\nimmoral interests. Such as, for example, the self-serving interests of\npredatory slumlords, sometimes protected by legal property rights.\nTherefore, if justified, the moral justification of such legal rights\nmust derive from reasons other than the (amoral or immoral) interests\nthat those rights protect (Raz 1995: 31\u201332). \n\nSecond, even in the common case wherein the function of a legal right\nvis-\u00e0-vis the right-holder does indeed morally count\nin favor of the law adopting that right, at times there is a\njustificatory gap between the value of that function and the\nright\u2019s justification. Here the contribution of the\nright\u2019s function to the right\u2019s justification is, on its\nown, insufficient, suggesting that if morally justified, it is by\nreasons not exclusive to the value of the right\u2019s function (Raz\n1994: 48\u201349). Surprisingly, a common misstep in the discourse on\nthe justification of rights is confusing interest with right. As if\nthe mere demonstration that X has a weighty interest in \u03c6\ndirectly entails X morally ought to have a legal right to\n\u03c6. Yet, the fact is that X\u2019s interest in \u03c6\nperhaps counts in favor of X holding a legal right protective\nof that interest, but it does not necessarily justify it and it is\ncertainly not its equivalent. \n\nSuch justificatory gaps are often bridged by reasons of the common\ngood (or public interest) or the interests of other individuals\ncounting in favor of X holding a certain legal right (Raz 1994:\n49\u201355; 1995: 33\u201334; Harel 1994: 704\u2013714). Examples\nare plentiful. For instance, arguably parents\u2019 rights for tax\nbreaks and welfare benefits are predicated not only on the interests\nof the parents\u2019 themselves (the right-holders) in the means to\ncare for their children, but also on the interests of the children and\non the public\u2019s interest in the fulfillment of these parental\ninterests. The same is true of patent law, wherein intellectual\nproperty is granted not only on the grounds of innovators\u2019\ninterests in controlling their inventions and in enjoying their\nproceeds, but perhaps more so to incentivize future innovators and\ninvestors by the means of satisfying those interests, thereby serving\nthe overall social interest in innovation. The same form of argument\nis likely applicable, for example, to other types of property rights\n(Raz 1995: 33\u201334) as well as to corporate rights (Raz 1986: 179;\n1994: 275). Even the right to free speech finds much of its\njustification in its contribution to the common good (e.g., promoting\ncritical thought, bolstering democracy, enriching public discourse,\npromoting innovation) or to the interest of third parties (such as\n\u201clisteners\u201d), the moral significance of which often\ngreatly exceeds any benefits that most individual right-holders derive\n(at least directly) from the protections their free-speech rights\nafford them (Raz 1986: 178\u2013179; 1994: 54\u201355; Harel 1994:\n704\u2013714; 1998; 2005: 196).\n",
