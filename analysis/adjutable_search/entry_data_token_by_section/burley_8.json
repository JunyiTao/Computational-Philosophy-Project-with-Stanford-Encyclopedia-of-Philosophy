    "main_text": "The \u201cPlatonic\u201d turn (after 1324): the \u2018regional\u2019 ontologies\n8. The theories of knowledge\n\nDuring his long career, Walter Burley worked out two different\naccounts of the standard realist theory of knowledge, both of which\nare critical of the most common theories of his time. Burley himself\nplaces much more stress on the question of the proper object of human\nknowledge and the intellective cognition of individuals. The first\naccount is developed in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De\nanima (before 1316), and the second in the prologue of his last\ncommentary on the Physics (around 1324).\n\nIn the commentary on De anima, Burley deals with the problems\nof the object of knowledge and the possibility of direct intellective\ncognition of singulars, especially in questions 5 and 6 of Book III:\n\u201cutrum intellectus intelligat singulare [Does the\nintellect understand what is singular]?\u201d and \u201cutrum\nuniversale sit obiectum intellectus [Is what is universal an\nobject of the intellect]?\u201d (fols. 69rb\u201370va). In order to answer\nthese two questions, Burley, like Averroes, begins by distinguishing\nthree different aspects and one state of the soul which can be\ndesignated by the term \u2018intellect\u2019: the elementary thought\n(virtus cogitativa\u2014which, for Burley, as for Thomas\nAquinas and Giles of Rome, is a purely sensory faculty); the active\nintellect; the possible intellect (which, following Averroes\u2019s\nterminology, Burley calls \u201cmaterialis\u201d); and the\nintellect in habitu, i.e., that state of the intellect in\nwhich, thanks to the union of the active intellect with the material\nintellect, an intelligible species comes into being in the material\nintellect, generating an effective act of cognition. Since, in\nBurley\u2019s view, both the active intellect and the intellect in\nhabitu are not strictly speaking faculties of the soul, but the\nprimary cause of understanding and a state of the soul, respectively,\nit is necessary for him to offer two distinct accounts depending on\nwhether it is the elementary thought or the material intellect which\nis in question. In the first case, the material singular is the direct\nand sufficient object of the intellect, insofar as elementary thought,\nlike common sense and imagination, is directed exclusively towards\nindividuals, both substantial and accidental. But in the second case,\nit is the universal that is the direct and appropriate object of the\nintellect, because the intentional representation (species or\nintentio) produced by the singular in the soul is not formed\nor \u2018taken in\u2019 by the material intellect, as the only\nspecies present in the material intellect is the universal.\nNevertheless, Burley acknowledges that the material intellect also has\nknowledge of the singular in an indirect and derivative way\n(indirecte et ex consequenti). Accordingly, he disagrees with\nthose authors who, on the basis of the Aristotelian assertion that\n\u201csensation is of singulars; but understanding is of\nuniversals\u201d, affirm that the singular cannot in any way be the\nobject of intellective knowledge. According to Burley, what the\nAristotle means is that the senses can grasp directly and\nappropriately only the singular, whereas the universal can be known in\na direct and proper manner only by the material intellect (cf. also\nIn De an., I, q.5: \u201cutrum intelligere sit propria\noperatio animae vel totius coniuncti [Is understanding the proper\nactivity of the soul or of the entire conjunct <of body and\nsoul>?\u201d, fol. 13va; and De potentiis animae, p.\n111). What is more, were the material intellect unable to know the\nsingular, it would be impossible for us to distinguish what is\nindividual from what is universal. As a matter of fact, even though\nthe species present in the material intellect is universal, and cannot\nby itself point to any particular individual, the material intellect\ncan know the singular by means of intentional representations\n(phantasma) present in the elementary thought, since the\nphantasm is nothing but the intentional representation of a single\nindividual substance obtained through the accidental properties it\nexhibits. Thanks to such a representation the (material) intellect can\nassimilate itself in the act of knowing to singular things attested to\nby the senses.\n\nBut Burley\u2019s explanation, however interesting, has a weak point, since\nit does not clarify how it is possible for the material intellect to\nknow an individual existing outside our mind by means of a singular\nintentional representation that is not present in it, but in\nelementary thought. The solution to this problem lies in what he says\nin the aformentioned q.5 of Book I, as well as in q.10 of Book III\n(\u201cutrum intellectus materialis copuletur nobis solum per\nphantasma [Is the material intellect joined to us only through an\nimage]?\u201d, fol. 76va\u2013b), concerning the problem of the union\n(copulatio) of singular human beings with the material\nintellect, which is assumed to be separate and unique for the whole\nhuman species. In his view, the material intellect is by nature united\nwith human individuals from birth, as the perfection of their being.\nBut a further kind of union takes place when the material intellect\nperforms an act of understanding (in operando), i.e., when\nthe active intellect illumines both the phantasm and the material\nintellect, thereby impressing on the latter the species\nintelligibilis abstracted from the former\u2014intelligible\nspecies by means of which the material intellect can grasp the common\nnature of the singular substance which began the process of knowing.\nThis close connection between the phantasm and the intelligible\nspecies (which originates from it) is why (1) the material intellect\ncan know singulars through a representation that is not properly\npresent in it; and conversely, (2) the elementary thought can know,\nindirectly and derivatively, common natures (or universals)\n(\u201chomo per virtutem cogitativam potest cognoscere\nuniversalia et quidditates rerum\u201d, fol. 13va), even though\nits proper and adequate object is the singular.\n\nThis account of the knowing process provides a twofold origin of human\nknowledge: the first empirical, from the senses; the other\ntranscendental, from the active intellect. On the one hand, the\nexternal and internal senses collect, decode, and elaborate\ninformation that comes from a singular material thing present to the\nsenses. The result is the formation of a phantasm of a thing. On the\nother hand, the active intellect impresses on the material intellect\nthe intelligible species, when the phantasm inhering in the elementary\nthought is presented to the material intellect itself. Intellection\nseems thus to consist in the matching, so to speak, of a phantasm with\nan intelligible species, a sort of classification of world items, in\nvirtue of which any given singular item is referred back to its type.\nThis entails that for Burley, the cognitive process is aimed at the\nsecond operation of the intellect, namely judgment (e.g.,\n\u201cSortes est homo\u201d), and not simply to\nabstraction, since it is by means of judgment that the intellect\nsubsumes a given token (the material thing) under its type (the\nnatural species). This fact also explains why the answer to the\nquestion concerning the proper object of the intellect is\ncomplicated.\n\nAs far as the problem of the primary object of knowledge is concerned,\nin the commentary on the De anima, Burley distinguishes (1) a\ntriple mode in which something can be the primary object of the\nintellect: by origin (via generationis), by intrinsic\nperfection (via perfectionis), and by proportion (via\nadaequationis); and (2) two different kinds of knowledge:\nanalytic (distincta) and vague (confusa). From the\npoint of view of analytic knowledge, i.e., adequately articulated and\ndeveloped knowledge, being is the first object of the intellect by\norigin. But from the point of view of vague knowledge, i.e., knowledge\nwhich is not yet articulated and developed, the first objects of the\nintellect by origin are the universals corresponding to those\nindividuals perceived by our senses. The first object of the intellect\nby intrinsic perfection is the first cause from the perspective of\nabsolute perfection; but in terms of relative perfection, it is the\nuniversal which corresponds to the individual present to our senses.\nFinally, the object by proportion of a given faculty is that item\nunder which all things known by that faculty fall. In the case of the\nintellect, being in its widest generality is such, as only that which\nis can be known. \n\nMoreover, Burley also distinguishes between the object which gives\nrise to the process of knowledge (obiectum motivum) and the\nobject that contains within itself all known things (obiectum\ncontentivum). The first is always singular, whereas the second is\nalways universal. In other words, what we come to know is a common\nnature, but this is possible just because there are particular things\nthat strike our senses (fol. 70ra\u2013b). \n\nAlthough Burley seems to accept the existence of a separate material\nintellect, unique to the whole human species, he emphasizes the fact\nthat without the contribution of elementary thought, which provides us\nwith the phantasm, the material intellect cannot be united to the\nactive intellect in knowing. It is true that individual men could not\nreach an intellective knowledge of anything without the material\nintellect; but it is also true that the material intellect on its own,\nor with the mere contribution of the active intellect, would not be\ncapable of elaborating any form of knowledge.\n\nThis particular reconstruction of the process of knowledge is\njustified at the ontological level too. Burley\u2019s earlier view about\nthe metaphysical composition of corporeal beings accounts for the way\nhe approaches questions concerning knowledge. He claims that corporeal\nbeings are constituted by an individual substance and a host of\naccidental forms inhering in it. Individual substance is then the\nresult of the union of particular matter and form (cf. Quaestiones\nin librum Perihermeneias, q.4, p. 272). Particular form is itself\nconstituted by a specific form (that is, the essence of the singular\nthing at issue) and by all of its metaphysical constituents. As we\nhave already seen, it is precisely in the commentary on the De\nanima (Book I, q.3) that Burley affirms that universals in the\ncategory of substance are constitutive parts in the essence of their\nindividuals, and have being in their individuals. All of this enables\nus to understand better why in his De anima commentary,\nBurley grants some level of intelligibility to singulars as such,\nthough indirectly and derivatively, and also why he describes\nelementary knowledge in terms of a classification of things according\nto which a given singular object is referred back to its ideal\ntype.\n\nNonetheless, about ten years later, in the prologue to his last\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics, Burley completely reversed\nhis position on knowledge. In partial agreement with Thomas Wilton,\nwho had been his socius in Paris, he maintained that our\nintellect is capable of knowing singulars qua singulars (sub\npropria ratione singularis) primarily and directly (primo et\ndirecte), and not simply as items belonging to a certain species\nor type. Indeed, he now argued that the universal can be grasped by\nthe intellect indirectly and by reflection (In Phys. I, fol.\n10va), an openly anti-Avverroistic statement which would steer him\ncloser to Ockhamist nominalism, were it not for his denial of any form\nof intuitionism. \n\nIn his discussion of the question, \u201cutrum magis universalia\nsint nobis prius nota quam minus universalia vel quam singularia\n[Is what is more universal more known to us than what is less\nuniversal, or than singulars]?\u201d (fol. 9va\u2013b), Burley deals once\nagain with the problems of the intelligibility of singulars and the\nobject of our knowledge. The question arises from the passage in the\nPhysics (I.1, 184a23\u201324), where Aristotle affirms that\nour knowledge must proceed from what is universal to what is\nparticular (or singular). According to Burley, it is false that what\nis more universal is known by us before (prius nota) what is\nless universal, as Thomas Aquinas had taught. Anyone who holds this,\nhe argues, implicitly assumes that the passage from ignorance to\nperfect cognition (notitia perfecta) is mediated by the\nknowledge of all the substantial forms of the object in question, from\nthe more general to the more particular. But this assumes that in\norder to know something, it is necessary to know everything that can\nbe predicated of it. This seems false to Burley, since it is openly\ncontradicted by experience: e.g., a person can know that the animal\nstanding in front of him is a horse, and what a horse is, without\nknowing all the other universal forms that are predicated of it (fol.\n9vb). A cognition of the latter kind is almost impossible, for it\nwould be necessary to acquire systematic knowledge of all animal\nspecies and of any possible grouping they could form\u2014something\nthat no human being can achieve (fols. 9vb\u201310ra). Nor is Burley\nconvinced by Ockham\u2019s interpretation of this passage in the latter\u2019s\ncommentary on the Physics (cf. Expositio in libros\nPhysicorum Aristotelis I, c.1, \u00a72, O.Ph. IV,\n24\u201325), according to which the Aristotelian principle applies\nonly to complex knowledge and referring to humanity as a whole,\nalthough for each of us taken singularly the contrary is true, because\nthe object of our simple and exhaustive knowledge (notita\nincomplexa perfecta) is the singular. Burley contends that what\nis true for individual human beings must also be true for humanity as\na whole, and therefore that at the level of human species as well, the\nknowledge of what is less universal comes before the knowledge of what\nis more universal (cf. fol. 10rb). \n\nBurley concludes this first part of his discussion, devoted to the\nanalysis and refutation of the opinions of Aquinas and Ockham, with a\nremark concerning the way in which general concepts are structured and\nrelated one to another. He presents a categorization of the different\ntypes of knowledge and reappraises to some extent the role of\ndefinition in knowledge. Burley affirms that the more universal\nconcepts are not closely connected with less universal concepts; they\ndo not form a logically or essentially ordered (essentialiter\nordinata) series. Definition provides us with better knowledge of\na thing than the knowledge we acquire from the mere apprehension of\nits name; nevertheless, the simple cognition which derives from the\nconfused and indistinct knowledge of the nominal notion of a given\nthing is sufficient for all practical purposes, and prior by origin to\nthe knowledge which results from its definition, as what is more\nsimple is prior to what is less simple. Thus, for Burley, we first\ngrasp the meaning of simple terms and then that of composite\nexpressions such as definitions. However, from the point of view of\nquantity of information or exhaustiveness, the most perfect definition\n(perfectissima definitio), i.e., the definition enumerating\nall four causes of the definiendum and not just its proximate genus\n(material cause) and specific difference (formal cause), is superior\nto any other form of knowledge (fol. 6rb). \n\nIn this (new) discussion of the nature of human knowledge, Burley\ndistinguishes between complex cognition (notitia complexa)\nand simple cognition (notitia incomplexa) (cf. fols. 5va\u2013b),\nas well as between two different types of exhaustive complex cognition\n(notitia perfecta complexa): (i) absolute\n(simpliciter) and (ii) relative to the general kind of thing\nin question (in genere) (see fols. 5vb\u20136ra). He also\ndistinguishes between appropriate (distincta) (or perfectly\nappropriate\u2014distinctissima) cognition and discrete or\ndiscriminative cognition (distinctive seu discretiva) (cf.\nfols. 10vb\u201311ra). A complex cognition of a thing is contained in and\nmanifested by one or more statements about it, both affirmative and\nnegative (fol. 5va). A simple cognition, on the other hand, is\ncontained in and manifested by simple concepts and expressions, namely\nterms (fol. 5vb). Complex exhaustive cognition simpliciter is\nwhat enables us to know all the intrinsic constitutive principles of a\nthing along with all the essential predicates and characteristic\nfeatures (propria) associated with these principles\nthemselves. Relative exhaustive complex cognition is what makes\npossible for us to know all the essential predicates and all the\ncharacteristic features associated with them in relation only to the\nnatural species (or type) of a thing (fol. 6ra). We have an\nappropriate cognition of a thing when we are able to list most of its\nconstitutive elements, and a perfectly appropriate knowledge when we\ncan specify all of its constituent elements (fol. 10vb). Finally, we\nhave discriminative knowledge of a thing when we are able to\ndistinguish the thing at issue from other similar things by virtue of\none or more peculiar aspects which make it different from all others\nof the same kind (fol. 11ra).\n\nKeeping these distinctions in mind, we can now move on to examine how\nBurley articulates his solution to the problem of the object of human\nknowledge. According to him, determining whether what is more\nuniversal is known by us before what is less universal is equivalent\nto establishing what is the primary and direct object by origin of\nconfused and appropriate cognitions. He thinks that from the point of\nview of the origin of our confused knowledge, the intellect grasps\nfirst what is singular. The argumentation he develops to support this\nclaim is articulated in two stages: (1) he demonstrates that the\nintellect is able to know what is singular, since it can easily\ndistinguish universals from singulars. If the intellect were unable to\nknow singulars, it would be impossible for it to distinguish what is\nuniversal from what is singular. This was the most important proof\nthat he had utilized in his De anima commentary to\ndemonstrate that the material intellect has some kind of singular\nknowledge, however indirect and derivative. Next, (2) he proves that\nthe primary object by way of generation (via generationis) of\nconfused knowledge is the singular, as it would be otherwise\nimpossible to explain how the intellect can obtain some kind of\nsingular knowledge on the basis of previous universal knowledge. If we\nknew what is universal before what is singular, we could never acquire\nknowledge of any singular, given that the universal species cannot\ndirect our intellect toward any particular individual, since it is\ntied to each individual by the same relation of similarity (fol.\n11rb). \n\nIn the De anima commentary, this remark did not prevent\nBurley from stating the exact opposite of what he intends to prove\nhere. He had held that the (material) intellect does not know\nsingulars through universal species, but through the intentional\nrepresentation of a given singular present in the elementary thought\nand accessible to the intellect only at the moment of the active union\nof a single individual man with the material and active intellects in\nthe soul. This means that the complex explanation of the process and\nnature of human knowledge developed in the De anima\ncommentary is completely rejected here, and replaced by a new theory\nmodelled not on Averroes\u2019s commentary but on Burley\u2019s own semantic and\nontological program. What is more, in Burley\u2019s new way of thinking,\nthe intellect does know the universal only by abstraction from\nsingulars; but abstraction always proceeds from what is already known\nto what is not yet known; therefore, singulars are known by us before\nuniversals (cf. fol. 11va). It is thus not surprising that Burley\nconcludes this first part of his answer, devoted to confused\nknowledge, by supporting a thesis diametrically opposed to what was\nproposed in his De anima commentary, namely that universals\nare known by the intellect indirectly and derivatively, through\nreflection. According to Burley, our intellect grasps what is\nuniversal only after having known at least one of the corresponding\nsingulars, even though it knows the lowest species of each singular\nalmost immediately, from the singular itself, whereas all the other\nuniversals contained in the lowest species (from the proximate genus\nup to the highest genus in the category to which the singular thing\nbelongs) are known only through reflection on the lowest species\nitself. The most immediate consequences of the adoption of this view\nare (1) a new theory concerning the object of intellective knowledge,\ndifferent from that presented in Book III of his De anima\ncommentary; and (2) a new definition of the function of the active\nintellect in the process of knowledge.\n\nBurley now distinguishes a four-fold way in which something can be\nconsidered the first object of the intellect: by origin, by\nproportion, by intrinsic perfection, and by exclusion (primitate\nexclusionis)\u2014the latter being the way a determinate\nobject can be known by a certain faculty and by that faculty alone,\nexcluding all others. The singular, and not the universal, is now\nconsidered the first object of the intellect by origin\u2014which\nwas obvious from what had been stated in the previous passages. Being,\ntaken in its broadest generality, is the first object of the intellect\nby proportion, but now Burley explains that being, understood in this\nway, is equivalent to intelligible being. The first object of the\nintellect by intrinsic perfection is God. In this case as well, there\nis a rather marked difference from the De anima commentary in\nthat Burley abandons the distinction between absolute and relative\nperfection (which had enabled him, once more, to introduce the\nuniversal as primary object of the intellect), and replaces the more\nimpersonal and abstract Aristotelian first cause with God (presumably\nthe Christian God). Finally, the universal is the object of the\nintellect by exclusion insofar as the intellect is the only faculty\ncapable of knowing it. \n\nFurthermore, as far as the role of the active intellect is concerned,\nthe claim that the singular is now intelligible in principle requires\nthat the job of the active intellect should no longer be the one\ntraditionally attributed to it of removing the individuating\nconditions from the phantasm; rather, it must now act on the possible\nintellect (intellectus possibilis). The active intellect\nmakes the possible intellect move from a state of purely potential\nintellection to a state of actual intellection (given by the presence\nin it of the intelligible species)\u2014a state which the phantasm\nwould not, on its own, be able to bring about in the possible\nintellect (cf. fol. 11vb). It is worth noting Burley\u2019s change in\nterminology, from the orthodox Averroistic expression\n\u201cintellectus materialis\u201d, as it appears in the\nDe anima commentary, to the expression more commonly used by\nopponents of the Averroists: \u201cintellectus\npossibilis\u201d.\n\nThe analysis of the question of the primary and direct object by\norigin of appropriate cognition is far shorter and less problematic.\nAppropriate cognition is the knowledge we obtain once we are capable\nof enumerating in an orderly way all the elementary metaphysical\ncomponents of a thing. Consequently, the starting points of this kind\nof knowledge cannot but be the most general universals, as their\nnotions constitute the basis from which the notions of less general\nuniversals and of singulars themselves will have to be\n\u201cbuilt\u201d and understood. The reason is that what is\nsubordinated to something else cannot be known in an appropriate\nmanner if those things which are above it in the categorial hierarchy\nand which constitute its essence are not known (fols. 10vb\u201311ra).\n\nIn this way, Burley points towards a double movement in the process of\nknowing: a first movement, connected with the activity of abstraction\nor generalization of the intellect (namely, the kind of knowledge he\ncalls \u2018confused\u2019), which goes from the bottom to the top\nof the categorial hierarchy, i.e., from what is singular to the\nhighest genus. Then there is a second movement, tied to the\ndefinitional activity of the intellect (namely the knowledge that he\ncalls appropriate\u2019), which goes from top to bottom of the categorial\nhierarchy, proceeding from what is more universal and therefore\nintensionally more simple and primitive to that which is less so,\nfinally reaching singulars, which are intentionally richer and\nontologically more complex than any universal.\n\nAs we have seen, within Burley\u2019s new theory of understanding the\nsingular can be placed either at the beginning of the chain of\nknowledge, as its origin, or at its end, as its result. In both cases,\nwhat remains unchanged is that intellective knowledge is at stake and\nnot simply sense knowledge. This means that for Burley, the singular\nis one of the primary objects of the cognitive activity of the human\nintellect. This result is historically significant because it brings\nBurley\u2019s later theory of knowledge into line with the other great\nepistemological doctrines of the fourteenth century, almost all of\nwhich were aimed at re-evaluating the singular as a possible object of\nknowledge. The way for this was prepared by the ontological turn in\nBurley\u2019s last commentary on the Physics: the move from an\nontology developed according to the canons of moderate realism to the\nradically realist ontology of macro-objects, based on a real\ndistinction between universals and singulars and among the ten\nAristotelian categories. Such a conception derives from the assumption\nof a hermeneutical principle which is clearly formulated by Burley for\nthe first time in the latter work, where he observes that the causes\nof a particular effect must be particular as well, and those of a\nuniversal effect must be universal. Accordingly, he denies that a\nuniversal cause can have a particular effect and vice-versa, and\ntherefore that what is singular can be directly constituted by those\nuniversal forms placed above it in the hierarchy of categorial\npredication (cf. fol. 9rb\u2013va).\n\nAt the cognitive level, negating any real identity between universals\nand singulars (which, on the contrary, had been assumed to hold in the\nDe anima commentary) brought with it a unification of the\nlevels of knowledge (sense cognition and abstractive cognition)\nthrough the intellectualization of the knowledge of singulars and a\ndoubling of the object of knowledge (the singular and the universal).\nThis was necessary so that the real distinction between universal and\nindividual at the ontological level did not make it impossible to\nexplain how sense knowledge (fully centered on singulars) and\nintellective knowledge (centred on universals) could\n\u201cmeet\u201d in judgments concerning individuals, as in\n\u201cSocrates is a man\u201d. This was possible in the De\nanima commentary precisely because of their real identity in the\nextra-mental world of universals and individuals; once this identity\nfailed, however, there was the risk of making the passage from the\nintentional representation of singulars to the intelligible species of\nthe common nature (or universal) into a sort of arbitrary distortion\nof the data coming from reality. The relation, now more slippery and\nfragile, between the (substantial) universal and the singular required\nthat singulars be moved from the sphere of imperfect and piecemeal\nsense knowledge and made available to the cognitive faculty that is\nconcerned with universals. Indeed, in the ontology of the later\nBurley, universal substantial forms are distinguished from accidental\nforms not because their being is somehow identified with the being of\nthose singular substances which are their substrates, but because they\nalone are capable of manifesting the deep metaphysical structure of\nthe singular substances themselves. The type, which in Burley\u2019s\nearlier writings was only something exhibited by singular substances,\nis now a reality distinct from them, though not totally separated or\nexistentially independent of them. Consequently, Burley\u2019s theory ends\nup putting substantial and accidental forms on the same level, and\ncancelling every qualitative difference in predication. This makes his\nlogical system considerably different from the\nAristotelian/Neo-Platonic systems of the Middle Ages, since for the\nlatter the predicative relation of any sentence of the\nsubject/copula/predicate form had to be understood as modally\ndetermined by the particular nature of the predicable corresponding to\nthe predicate (i.e., its species, genus, difference,\nproprium, accident). On the other hand, this makes Burley\u2019s\nlogical system the medieval system that is the most similar to modern\nones.\n",
