    "main_text": "The Politics of Marriage || Same-Sex Marriage\n4.3 Same-Sex Marriage\n\nMany arguments for same-sex marriage invoke liberal principles of\njustice such as equal treatment, equal opportunity, and neutrality.\nWhere same-sex marriage is not recognized in law, marriage provides\nbenefits which are denied to same-sex couples on the basis of their\norientation; if the function of marriage is the legal recognition of\nloving, or \u201cvoluntary intimate,\u201d relationships, the\nexclusion of same-sex relationships appears arbitrary and unjustly\ndiscriminatory (Wellington 1995, 13). Same-sex relationships are\nrelevantly similar to different-sex relationships recognized as\nmarriages, yet the state denies gays and lesbians access to the\nbenefits of marriage, hence treating them unequally (Mohr 2005, Rajczi\n2008, Williams 2011). Further, arguments in support of such\ndiscrimination seem to depend on controversial moral claims regarding\nhomosexuality of the sort excluded by neutrality (Wellington 1995,\nSchaff 2004, Wedgwood 1999, Arroyo 2018).\n\nA political compromise (sometimes proposed in same-sex marriage\ndebates) of restricting marriage to different-sex couples and offering\ncivil unions or domestic partnerships to same-sex couples does not\nfully answer the arguments for same-sex marriage. To see why such a\ntwo-tier solution fails to address the arguments grounded in equal\ntreatment, we must consider what benefits marriage provides. There are\ntangible benefits such as eligibility for health insurance and\npensions, privacy rights, immigration eligibility, and hospital\nvisiting rights (see Mohr 2005, Chapter 3), which could be provided\nthrough an alternate status. Crucially, however, there is also the\nimportant benefit of legal, and indirectly social, recognition of a\nrelationship as marriage. The status of marriage itself confers\nlegitimacy and invokes social support. A two-tier system would not\nprovide equal treatment because it does not confer on same-sex\nrelationships the status associated with marriage.\n\nIn addition, some philosophers have argued that excluding gays and\nlesbians from marriage is central to gay and lesbian oppression,\nmaking them \u2018second-class citizens\u2019 and underlying social\ndiscrimination against them. Marriage is central to concepts of good\ncitizenship, and so exclusion from it displaces gays and lesbians from\nfull and equal citizenship: \u201cbeing fit for marriage is\nintimately bound up with our cultural conception of what it means to\nbe a citizen \u2026 because marriage is culturally conceived as\nplaying a uniquely foundational role in sustaining civil\nsociety\u201d (Calhoun 2000, 108). From this perspective, the\n\u2018separate-but-equal\u2019 category of civil unions retains the\nharmful legal symbol of inferiority (Card 2007, Mohr 2005, 89, Calhoun\n2000, Chapter 5; cf. Stivers and Valls 2007; for a comprehensive\nsurvey of these issues, see Macedo 2015).\n\nHowever, if marriage is essentially different-sex, excluding same-sex\ncouples is not unequal treatment; same-sex relationships simply do not\nqualify as marriages. One case that marriage is essentially\ndifferent-sex invokes linguistic definition: marriage is by definition\ndifferent-sex, just as a bachelor is by definition an unmarried man\n(Stainton, cited in Mercier 2001). But this confuses meaning and\nreference. Past applications of a term need not yield necessary and\nsufficient criteria for applying it: \u2018marriage\u2019, like\n\u2018citizen\u2019, may be extended to new cases without thereby\nchanging its meaning (Mercier 2001). As noted above, appeal to past\ndefinition begs the question of what the legal definition should be\n(Stivers and Valls 2007).\n\nA normative argument for that marriage is essentially different-sex\nappeals to its purpose: reproduction in a naturally procreative unit\n(see 3.2.a). But marriage does not require that spouses be able to\nprocreate naturally, or that they intend to do so at all. Further,\nmarried couples adopt and reproduce using donated gametes, rather than\nprocreating \u2018naturally\u2019. Nor do proponents of this\nobjection to same-sex marriage generally suggest that entry to\nmarriage should be restricted by excluding those unable to procreate\nwithout third-party assistance, or not intending to do so.\n\nIndeed, as the existence of intentionally childless married couples\nsuggests, marriage has purposes other than\nchild-rearing\u2014notably, fostering a committed relationship (Mohr\n2005, Wellington 1995, Wedgwood 1999). This point suggests a second\ndefense of same-sex marriage: exclusive marital commitments are goods\nwhich the state should promote amongst same-sex as well as\nopposite-sex couples (Macedo 1995). As noted above, such rationales\ncome into tension with liberal neutrality; further controversy\nregarding them will be discussed below (5.2).\n\nSome arguments against same-sex marriage invoke a precautionary\nprinciple urging that changes which might affect child welfare be made\nwith extreme caution. But in light of the data available, Murphy\nargues that the precautionary principle has been met with regard to\nharm to children. On his view, parenting is a basic civil right, the\nrestriction of which requires the threat of a certain amount of harm.\nBut social science literature shows that children are neither\ntypically nor seriously harmed by same-sex parenting (see Manning\net al., 2014). Even if two biological parents statistically\nprovide the optimal parenting situation, optimality is too high a\nstandard for permitting parenting. This can be seen if an optimality\ncondition is imagined for other factors, such as education or wealth\n(Murphy 2011).\n\nA third objection made to same-sex marriage is that its proponents\nhave no principled reason to oppose legally recognizing polygamy (e.g.\nFinnis 1997; see Corvino 2005). One response differentiates the two by\nciting harmful effects and unequal status for women found in\nmale-headed polygyny, but not in same-sex marriage (e.g. Wedgwood\n1999, Crookston 2014, de Marneffe 2016, Macedo 2015). Another response\nis to bite the bullet: a liberal state should not choose amongst the\nvarious ways (compatible with justice) individuals wish to organize\nsex and intimacy. Thus, the state should recognize a diversity of\nmarital relationships\u2014including polygamy (Calhoun 2005, Mahoney\n2008) or else privatize marriage, relegating it to private contract\nwithout special legal recognition or definition (Baltzly 2012).\n\nFinally, some arguments against same-sex marriage rely on judgments\nthat same-sex sexual activity is impermissible. As noted above, the\nsoundness of these arguments aside, neutrality and political\nliberalism exclude appeal to such contested moral views in justifying\nlaw in important matters (Rawls 1997, 779, Schaff 2004, Wedgwood 1999,\nArroyo 2018). However, some arguments against same-sex\nmarriage have invoked neutrality, on the grounds that legalizing\nsame-sex marriage would force some citizens to tolerate what they find\nmorally abhorrent (Jordan 1995, and see Beckwith 2013). But this\nreasoning seems to imply, absurdly, that mixed-race marriage, where\nthat is the subject of controversy, should not be legalized. A rights\nclaim to equal treatment (if such a claim can support same-sex\nmarriage) trumps offense caused to those who disagree; the state is\nnot required to be neutral in matters of justice (Beyer 2002; Boonin\n1999; Schaff 2004; see also Barry 2011, Walker 2015).\n",
