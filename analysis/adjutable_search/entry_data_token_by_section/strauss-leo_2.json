    "main_text": "Esotericism\n3. Esotericism\n\nStrauss\u2019s claims about esotericism ought to be understood within\nthe broader trajectory of his life\u2019s work. Such an approach is\nin fact in keeping with Strauss\u2019s own recommendation for how to\nread philosophical texts, esoteric or otherwise. According to Strauss,\nan interpretation of a given text must begin \u201cfrom an exact\nconsideration of the explicit statements of an author.\u201d However,\n\u201cThe context in which a statement occurs\u2026must be\nperfectly understood before an interpretation of the statement can\nreasonably claim to be adequate or even correct\u201d (PAW, p. 130).\nTurning to the context of Strauss\u2019s claims about esotericism\nhelps to unravel a number of other important themes in his work,\nincluding what he calls the \u201ctheologico-political predicament of\nmodernity,\u201d the quarrel between the ancients and the moderns,\nand the relation between revelation and philosophy (what Strauss also\ncalls \u201cJerusalem and Athens\u201d).\n\nIn his first published contention that Maimonides is an esoteric\nwriter, Strauss self-consciously examines what it means to write\nabout an esoteric text. Clearly referring to himself, Strauss\nwrites:\n\nNo historian who has a sense of decency and therefore a sense of\nrespect for a superior man such as Maimonides will disregard\nlight-heartedly the latter\u2019s emphatic entreaty not to explain\nthe secret teaching of the Guide. It may fairly be said that\nan interpreter who does not feel pangs of conscience when attempting\nto explain that secret teaching and perhaps when perceiving for the\nfirst time its existence and bearing lacks that closeness to the\nsubject which is indispensable for the true understanding of any book.\nThus the question of adequate interpretation of the Guide is\nprimarily a moral one. (PAW, p. 55)\n\n\nStrauss maintains that before attempting to answer the question of\nwhether a secret teaching, only hinted at in the text, can be grasped\nwith confidence and precision, it is necessary to consider the moral\nimplications as well as the moral impetus of a writer willing to write\nabout such a secret. In making this claim, Strauss aligns his own\ndilemma with Maimonides\u2019 dilemma and by so doing he points to\nthe basic motivation that directs his own claims about esotericism.\nThe question is thus twofold: why did Maimonides write the\nGuide in the first place and why does Strauss write about\nesoteric writing? In answering the first question, Strauss notes that\nthe literary form of the Guide is a letter to\nMaimonides\u2019 gifted student Joseph, who, like many Jews of\nMaimonides\u2019 time, was traveling in far and distant lands:\n\u201cJoseph\u2019s departure was a consequence of his being a Jew\nin the Diaspora. Not a private need but only an urgent necessity of\nnation-wide bearing can have driven Maimonides to transgress an\nexplicit prohibition [to write about esoteric matters]. Only the\nnecessity of saving the law can have caused him to break the\nlaw\u201d (PAW, p. 49).\n\nIf this is Maimonides\u2019 reason, what is Strauss\u2019s? Strauss\nis willing to make the seemingly immoral and indecent move of\nrevealing the secrets of an esoteric text in order to save those\nsecrets. The secret that Strauss seeks to save is insight into the\npolitical, philosophical, and theological meaning of what he calls\n\u201ca forgotten type of writing.\u201d But why does Strauss care\nabout this forgotten type of writing? We can only answer this question\nby looking to Strauss\u2019s published work as a whole and to the\nplace of Persecution and the Art of Writing within this whole\nand to do so it is necessary to understand Strauss\u2019s most basic\nquestion, which concerns what he calls the \u201ctheologico-political\npredicament of modernity.\u201d\n\n",
