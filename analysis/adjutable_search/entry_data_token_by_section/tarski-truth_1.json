    "main_text": "The 1933 programme and the semantic conception || Object language and metalanguage\n1.1 Object language and metalanguage\n\nIf the language under discussion (the object language) is\n\\(L\\), then the definition should be given in another language known\nas the metalanguage, call it \\(M\\). The metalanguage should\ncontain a copy of the object language (so that anything one can say in\n\\(L\\) can be said in \\(M\\) too), and \\(M\\) should also be able to talk\nabout the sentences of \\(L\\) and their syntax. Finally Tarski allowed\n\\(M\\) to contain notions from set theory, and a 1-ary predicate symbol\nTrue with the intended reading \u2018is a true sentence of\n\\(L\\)\u2019. The main purpose of the metalanguage was to formalise\nwhat was being said about the object language, and so Tarski also\nrequired that the metalanguage should carry with it a set of axioms\nexpressing everything that one needs to assume for purposes of\ndefining and justifying the truth definition. The truth definition\nitself was to be a definition of True in terms of the other\nexpressions of the metalanguage. So the definition was to be in terms\nof syntax, set theory and the notions expressible in \\(L\\), but not\nsemantic notions like \u2018denote\u2019 or \u2018mean\u2019\n(unless the object language happened to contain these notions).\n\nTarski assumed, in the manner of his time, that the object language\n\\(L\\) and the metalanguage \\(M\\) would be languages of some kind of\nhigher order logic. Today it is more usual to take some kind of\ninformal set theory as one\u2019s metalanguage; this would affect a\nfew details of Tarski\u2019s paper but not its main thrust. Also\ntoday it is usual to define syntax in set-theoretic terms, so that for\nexample a string of letters becomes a sequence. In fact one must use a\nset-theoretic syntax if one wants to work with an object language that\nhas uncountably many symbols, as model theorists have done freely for\nover half a century now.\n",
