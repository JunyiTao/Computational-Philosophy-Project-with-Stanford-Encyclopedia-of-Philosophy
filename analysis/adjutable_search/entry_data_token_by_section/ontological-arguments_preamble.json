    "main_text": "\n\nOntological arguments are arguments, for the conclusion that God\nexists, from premises which are supposed to derive from some source\nother than observation of the world\u2014e.g., from reason alone. In\nother words, ontological arguments are arguments from what are\ntypically alleged to be none but analytic, a priori and\nnecessary premises to the conclusion that God exists. \n\nThe first, and best-known, ontological argument was proposed by St.\nAnselm of Canterbury in the 11th century C.E. In his\nProslogion, St. Anselm claims to derive the existence of God\nfrom the concept of a being than which no greater can be\nconceived. St. Anselm reasoned that, if such a being fails to\nexist, then a greater being\u2014namely, a being than which no\ngreater can be conceived, and which exists\u2014can be\nconceived. But this would be absurd: nothing can be greater than a\nbeing than which no greater can be conceived. So a being than which no\ngreater can be conceived\u2014i.e., God\u2014exists.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, Ren\u00e9 Descartes defended a family of\nsimilar arguments. For instance, in the Fifth Meditation,\nDescartes claims to provide a proof demonstrating the existence of God\nfrom the idea of a supremely perfect being. Descartes argues that\nthere is no less contradiction in conceiving a supremely perfect being\nwho lacks existence than there is in conceiving a triangle whose\ninterior angles do not sum to 180 degrees. Hence, he supposes, since\nwe do conceive a supremely perfect being\u2014we do have the idea of\na supremely perfect being\u2014we must conclude that a supremely\nperfect being exists.\n\nIn the early eighteenth century, Gottfried Leibniz attempted to fill\nwhat he took to be a shortcoming in Descartes\u2019 view. According\nto Leibniz, Descartes\u2019 arguments fail unless one first shows\nthat the idea of a supremely perfect being is coherent, or that it is\npossible for there to be a supremely perfect being. Leibniz argued\nthat, since perfections are unanalysable, it is impossible to\ndemonstrate that perfections are incompatible\u2014and he concluded\nfrom this that all perfections can co-exist together in a single\nentity.\n\nIn more recent times, Kurt G\u00f6del, Charles Hartshorne, Norman\nMalcolm and Alvin Plantinga have all presented much-discussed\nontological arguments which bear interesting connections to the\nearlier arguments of St. Anselm, Descartes and Leibniz. Of these, the\nmost interesting are those of G\u00f6del and Plantinga; in these\ncases, however, it is unclear whether we should really say that these\nauthors claim that the arguments are proofs of the existence\nof God.\n\nCritiques of ontological arguments begin with Gaunilo, a contemporary\nof St. Anselm. Perhaps the best known criticisms of ontological\narguments are due to Immanuel Kant, in his Critique of Pure\nReason. Most famously, Kant claims that ontological arguments are\nvitiated by their reliance upon the implicit assumption that\n\u201cexistence\u201d is a real predicate. However, as Bertrand Russell\nobserved, it is much easier to be persuaded that ontological arguments\nare no good than it is to say exactly what is wrong with them. This\nhelps to explain why ontological arguments have fascinated\nphilosophers for almost a thousand years.\n\nIn various ways, the account provided to this point is rough, and\nsusceptible of improvement. Sections 1\u20136 in what follows provide\nsome of the requisite embellishments, though\u2014as is usually the\ncase in philosophy\u2014there are many issues taken up here which\ncould be pursued at much greater length. Sections 7\u20139 take up\nsome of the central questions at a slightly more sophisticated level\nof discussion. Section 10 is a quick overview of very recent work on\nontological arguments:\n",
