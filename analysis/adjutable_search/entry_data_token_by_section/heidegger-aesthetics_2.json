    "main_text": "Heidegger\u2019s Philosophical Critique of Aesthetics: Introduction\n2. Heidegger\u2019s Philosophical Critique of Aesthetics: Introduction\n\n\nHeidegger believes that the aestheticization of art has gotten us\nlate moderns stuck in the rarefied and abstract view according to which\n\u201cthe enjoyment of art serves [primarily] to satisfy the refined\ntaste of connoisseurs and aesthetes.\u201d Hence his amusing but\nharsh judgment that: \u201cFor us today, \u2026art belongs in\nthe domain of the pastry chef\u201d (IM 140/GA40 140). That our\nculture blithely celebrates caf\u00e9 baristas who compete over the\n\u201cart\u201d of pouring foamed milk into our cappuccinos suggests\nthat we have lost sight of the role art can play in shaping history at\nthe deepest level, an ontologically revolutionary role compared to\nwhich Heidegger finds the \u201cartful\u201d gestures of culinary\nexpertise rather empty.\n\n\nFor the same reason, Heidegger is no more impressed by Kant\u2019s highbrow\nview that the disinterested contemplation of art should \u201cserve\nthe moral elevation of the mind\u201d (IM 140/GA40\n 140).[10]\nInstead, Heidegger is clearly sympathetic to the\n\u201ccomplaint\u201d that, as he puts it:\n\n\ninnumerable aesthetic considerations of and investigations into art\nand the beautiful have achieved nothing, they have not helped anyone\ngain access to art, and they have contributed virtually nothing to\nartistic creativity or to a sound appreciation of art. (N1\n79/GA43 92)\n\n\nHeidegger would thus agree with the sentiment behind Barnet\nNewman\u2019s famous quip: \u201cAesthetics is for the artist\nas ornithology is for the\n birds.\u201d[11]\nStill, for Heidegger such complaints,\nwhile \u201ccertainly right,\u201d are really only symptomatic of a\nmuch deeper philosophical problem, a problem which stems from the way\nmodern aesthetics is rooted in the subject/object divide lying at the\nvery heart of the modern worldview. In order to get to the heart\nof the problem, then, we need to take a step back and ask: How\n exactly does Heidegger understand\n aesthetics?[12]\n",
