    "main_text": "Antecedents of Functionalism || Behaviorism\n2.3 Behaviorism\n\nOther important recent antecedents of functionalism are the\nbehaviorist theories that emerged in the early-to-mid twentieth\ncentury. These include both the \u201clogical\u201d or\n\u201canalytical\u201d behaviorism of philosophers such as Malcolm\n(1968) and Ryle (1949) (and, arguably, Wittgenstein 1953) and the\nempirical psychological theories associated primarily with Watson and\nSkinner. \n\nLogical behaviorism is a thesis about the meanings of our mental state\nterms or concepts \u2013 in particular, that all statements about\nmental states and processes are equivalent in meaning to statements\nabout behavioral dispositions. So, for (again, an overly simplified)\nexample, \u201cHenry has a toothache\u201d would be equivalent in\nmeaning to a statement such as \u201cHenry is disposed (all things\nbeing equal) to cry out or moan and to rub his jaw\u201d. And\n\u201cAmelia is thirsty\u201d would be equivalent to a statement\nsuch as \u201cIf Amelia is offered some water, she will be disposed\n(all things being equal) to drink it.\u201d These candidate\ntranslations, like all behavioristic statements, eschew reference to\nany internal states of the organism, and thus do not threaten to\ndenote, or otherwise induce commitment to, properties or processes\n(directly) observable only by introspection. In addition, logical\nbehaviorists argued that if statements about mental states were\nequivalent in meaning to statements about behavioral dispositions,\nthere could be an unproblematic account of how mental state terms\ncould be applied both to oneself and others, and how they could be\ntaught and learned. \n\nIn contrast, scientific behaviorism is an empirical theory that\nattempts to explain the behavior of humans (and other animals) by\nappealing solely to behavioral dispositions, that is, to the lawlike\ntendencies of organisms to behave in certain ways, given certain\nenvironmental stimulations. Stimulations and behavior, unlike\nthoughts, feelings, and other internal states that can be directly\nobserved only by introspection, are objectively observable, and are\nindisputably part of the natural world. Thus behavioral dispositions\nseemed to be fit entities to figure centrally in the emerging science\nof psychology, allowing for a science of human behavior as objective\nand explanatory as other \u201chigher-level\u201d sciences such as\nchemistry and biology. Also, behaviorist theories promised to avoid a\npotential regress that appeared to threaten psychological explanations\ninvoking internal representations, namely, that to specify how such\nrepresentations produce the behaviors in question, one must appeal to\nan internal intelligent agent (a \u201chomunculus\u201d) who\ninterprets the representations, and whose skills would themselves have\nto be explained.\n\nBoth varieties of behaviorism, however, faced a common problem.\n\nAs many philosophers have pointed out (e.g. Chisholm 1957; Geach\n1957), logical behaviorism provides an implausible account of the\nmeanings of our mental state terms, since, intuitively, a subject can\nhave the mental states in question without the relevant behavioral\ndispositions \u2013 and vice versa. For example, Gene may believe\nthat it\u2019s going to rain even if he\u2019s not disposed to wear\na raincoat and take an umbrella when leaving the house (or to perform\nany other cluster of rain-avoiding behaviors), if Gene doesn\u2019t\nmind, or actively enjoys, singing in the rain. And subjects with the\nrequisite motivation can suppress their tendencies to pain behavior\neven in the presence of excruciating pain, while skilled actors can\nperfect the lawlike disposition to produce pain behavior under certain\nconditions, even if they don\u2019t actually feel pain. (See e.g.\nPutnam 1965) The problem, these philosophers argued, is that no mental\nstate, by itself, can plausibly be assumed to give rise to any\nparticular behavior unless one also assumes that the subject possesses\nadditional mental states of various types. And so, it seemed, it is\nnot in fact possible to give meaning-preserving translations of\nstatements invoking pains, beliefs, and desires in purely\nbehavioristic terms; one needs to include reference to the\nsubject\u2019s other mental states as well. Nonetheless, the idea\nthat our common sense concepts of mental states reveal an essential\ntie between mental states and their typical behavioral expressions is\nretained, and elaborated, in contemporary \u201canalytic\u201d\nfunctionalist theories.\n\nScientific behaviorism faced similar challenges. The theories of\nWatson, Skinner, et al had some early successes, especially in the\ndomain of animal learning, and its principles are still used, at least\nfor heuristic purposes, in various areas of psychology. But as many\npsychologists (and others, e.g. Chomsky 1959) have argued, the\nsuccesses of behaviorism seem to depend upon the experimenters\u2019\nimplicit control of certain variables which, when made explicit,\ninvolve ineliminable reference to organisms\u2019 other mental\nstates. For example, rats are typically placed into an experimental\nsituation at a certain fraction of their normal body weight \u2013\nand thus can be assumed to feel hunger and to\nwant the food rewards contingent upon behaving in certain\nways. Similarly, it is assumed that humans, in analogous experimental\nsituations, want to cooperate with the experimenters, and\nunderstand and know how to follow the instructions. It seemed\nto the critics of behaviorism, therefore, that theories that\nexplicitly appeal to an organism\u2019s beliefs, desires, and other\nmental states, as well as to stimulations and behavior, would provide\na fuller and more accurate account of why organisms behave as they do.\nThey could do so, moreover, without compromising the objectivity of\npsychology as long as the mental states to which these theories appeal\nare introduced as states that together play a role in the\nproduction of behavior, rather than states identifiable solely by\nintrospection. Thus work was begun on a range of\n\u201ccognitive\u201d psychological theories which reflected these\npresumptions, and an important strain of contemporary functionalism,\n\u201cpsychofunctionalism\u201d (Fodor 1968, Block and Fodor 1972)\ncan be seen a philosophical endorsement of these new cognitive\ntheories of mind.\n",
