    "main_text": "Introduction || What are jury theorems?\n1.1 What are jury theorems?\n\nHow many individuals should be entrusted with a given decision?\nEpistemically speaking, what matters is how the correctness or quality\nof decisions depends on the number of participants, for instance, how\nthe correctness of jury verdicts (\u201cinnocent\u201d or\n\u201cguilty\u201d) depends on jury size, how the quality of\nparliamentary decisions depends on parliament size, how the quality of\nelection outcomes depends on the size of the electorate, or how the\nquality of expert advice depends on the size of the advisory body.\nJury theorems address this problem. Their perspective is epistemic\nrather than procedural: the sole aim is to reach \u201cgood\u201d or\n\u201ccorrect\u201d decisions by an external standard rather than to\nrespect individual participation rights or ensure democratically\nlegitimate decisions. The reliance on correctness facts is the central\nphilosophical commitment of jury theorems (see\n Section 4.1).\n\nThis entry refers to the set of individuals participating in the\ndecision as the group or (decision) body, and to the\nlarger set from which this group is selected as the\npopulation. Examples are electoral bodies selected from the\npopulation of citizens, and scientific advisory bodies selected from\nthe population of scientists. In real life, some decision bodies are\nvery large: electoral bodies often contain millions of citizens. Other\nbodies have medium size: juries in court often involve 12 members. Yet\nother bodies have few or just one member: authoritarian states are\nruled by small cliques or just one person.\n\nJury theorems are mathematical theorems of the following general\nstructure:\n\nGeneric Jury Theorem: Given a choice problem of type\nX, a voting procedure of type Y, and premises about\nindividuals Z, the epistemic performance of group decisions\ndepends on group size in ways W.\n\nThis schematic statement contains several parameters, filled in\ndifferently by different jury theorems. The first and simplest jury\ntheorem goes back to French enlightenment philosopher and\nmathematician Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de\nCondorcet. In Condorcet\u2019s (1785) theorem,\n\nthe choice problem is binary, like the guilty-or-innocent problem\nof juries;\nthe voting procedure is majority voting;\nthe premises on individuals are competence and independence\nassumptions of particularly simple kinds;\nthe conclusion is that \u201ccrowds are wise\u201d in the\ntwofold sense that the probability of a correct group decision (i)\nincreases in group size and (ii) converges to one as group size\napproaches infinity.\n\n\nThese two Condorcetian \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d conclusions have\nconsiderably shaped the field, because they reappear (partly or fully)\nin many other jury theorems, whilst being controversial. The research\nprogramme of the jury theorem literature is partly an attempt to place\none or both Condorcetian conclusions on improved premises, and partly\nan attempt to derive jury theorems reaching rival conclusions, such as\nthe optimality of some finite and possibly small group size (against\nCondorcet\u2019s first conclusion) or the fallibility of\nasymptotically large bodies (against Condorcet\u2019s second\nconclusion).\n\nTaken in themselves, the Condorcetian conclusions represent two\ncontroversial wisdom-of-crowds hypotheses, which can be stated more\ngenerally (Dietrich & Spiekermann 2020):\n\nThe Increasing-Reliability Hypothesis: Larger bodies\nare better truth-trackers. They make epistemically better decisions\nthan smaller bodies or single individuals.\n\nThe Infallibility Hypothesis: Huge bodies are\ninfallible truth-trackers. They make epistemically optimal decisions\nin the limit as group size tends to infinity.\n\nUpon deeper analysis, the infallibility hypothesis is untenable, and\ncannot even serve as an approximation, idealisation or paradigm of how\nlarge-scale democracy performs (see\n Section 2).\n The fact that many jury theorems reach this over-optimistic\nconclusion has not always been helpful, by threatening the credibility\nof the jury theorem literature as a whole. The right response is to\nrevise the premises of jury theorems such that they become justifiable\nand imply plausible conclusions, like increasing reliability. Jury\ntheorems with more plausible premises and conclusions are indeed\nachievable (see\n Section 2).\n\nThe increasing-reliability hypothesis thus appears to be the more\nappropriate rendition of the wisdom of crowds. The infallibility\nhypothesis should arguably give way, as will emerge in\n Section 2\n and\n Section 4.2\n (see\n Section 4.3\n for a potential exception). Jury theorems reaching the infallibility\nconclusion can be mathematically interesting; philosophically, they\nmight be seen as arguments against their own premises.\n",
