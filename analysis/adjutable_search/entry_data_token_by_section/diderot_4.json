    "main_text": "Diderot\u2019s Life and Major Writings || Twilight Years (1773\u20131784)\n1.4 Twilight Years (1773\u20131784)\n\nFurther helping Diderot after 1765 was the generosity of Catherine the\nGreat of Russia, and his trip to her court in St. Petersburg in 1773\nmarks the passage of Diderot into the final stages of his career.\n\nCatherine watched the development of the Encyclop\u00e9die\nproject with great interest and expressed affection for French\nEnlightenment philosophie overall. Fate provided her with an\noccasion to express her appreciation directly to Diderot when a\nfinancial burden forced him to sell his library. Catherine made the\npurchase, giving Diderot an annual pension in addition. This made him\na wealthy man for the rest of his life. Diderot traveled to St.\nPetersburg to meet with Catherine in 1773\u201374, and this trip\nmarks his entrance into a leisured retirement in Paris where he\ncontinued to write.\n\nDiderot\u2019s last writings continued themes pursued throughout his\nlife, but one new interest was history. His Essai sur les\nr\u00e8gnes de Claude et de N\u00e9ron, which turned interest\nin ethics and morality toward questions of politics, justice, and\nhistory, was one result, as were his contributions to the final\nedition of the abb\u00e9 Raynal\u2019s massive, nineteen-volume\nglobal history entitled Histoire philosophique et politique des\n\u00e9tablissements et du commerce des Europ\u00e9ens dans les\ndeux Indes.\n\nThe latter was produced by Raynal in a manner similar to the\nEncyclop\u00e9die, with numerous authors contributing. The\nresulting work was a pioneering world history defined by its argument\nthat the transformations triggered by the Colombian Encounter were the\ndecisive agent of world historical development. Diderot\u2019s\ncontributions included explorations of the role of commerce, conceived\nas an autonomous natural-historical force, in the shaping of political\nand social change, a theme that connects Diderot\u2019s writing with\nthe new sciences of Enlightenment political economy. The Atlantic\nslave trade also attracted his attention, and some of his most\npassionate contributions involve imagined dialogues about the horrors\nof the European imperial slave system spoken by oppressed Africans.\nRaynal\u2019s Histoire was a massive bestseller, translated\ninto many languages, and it was a direct influence on Hegel, Marx, and\nthrough both on modern world history more generally. Diderot\u2019s\ncontribution to this influence was as important as any.\n\nDiderot\u2019s contributions to Raynal\u2019s Histoire have\nbeen described as proto-anthropological, and another provocative work\nfrom these years, his Suppl\u00e9ment au voyage de\nBougainville, was similarly conceived and influential. The text\noffers an imagined dialogue between Tahitians and Europeans about the\ndifferent sexual, marital and familial mores of the two cultures, and\nDiderot anticipates through fiction the figure of the native\nethnographer who asks comparative questions about the foundations of\nmorality and civilization so as to generate universal cultural\nunderstandings through comparison.\n\nIn these texts, and others from these years such as his\nObservations sur le \u201cNakaz\u201d, a commentary on\nCatherine\u2019s Enlightened reform program for Russia, Diderot\nappears in a newly radical political guise as an aggressive\negalitarian and democrat who has little patience with traditional\njustifications for hierarchy and top-down distributions of power. He\nis also a passionate abolitionist with no tolerance for the crimes of\nthe Atlantic slave trade. Nature does not work through hierarchy,\nDiderot insists in these texts, and connecting politics with his\nnatural philosophy he argues for a radical decentralization of\npolitical authority, and a fully bottom-up, egalitarian understanding\nof social order. These convictions are also manifest in his thinking\nabout race and slavery. He rejected altogether the new anthropology\npromulgated by Kant and others that spoke of biologically and\ncivilizationally distinct races, offering instead a monogenetic\nunderstanding of humanity where difference was a matter of degree\nrather than kind. Diderot was by nature a writer and thinker, not a\npolitical activist, and his political philosophy, while suggestive of\nemerging radical political trends, appears as the least developed\naspect of his thought.\n\nWhen revolution erupted in France in 1789, the memory of Voltaire and\nRousseau led to their inclusion in the pantheon of revolutionary\nheroes worthy of immortal commemoration. Diderot, by contrast, was at\nbest forgotten and at worst treated as a figure hostile to the new\npolitical movements afoot.\n\nThis combination of neglect and outright hostility pushed Diderot to\nthe margins of French culture in the nineteenth century, and it would\ntake another century before retrospective interest in his work would\nbe renewed. Too systematically committed to his materialism, too\nvigorous in his irreligion, and too passionate and principled in his\nembrace of egalitarianism and universal democracy to be acceptable to\nanyone with the slightest worry about the rising tides of radical\nsocialism and materialist freethought, Diderot became a pariah for\nmany in nineteenth-century France and Europe. Only after 1870 was\ninterest in his work revived, thanks in part to the new editions of\nhis writings, which made him newly available to scholars and readers,\nand to the changing cultural and political climate. Soviet Marxists,\nfor example, played a key role in reviving Diderot scholarship after\n1900, and contemporary Diderot studies, which is thriving today, is\nlargely a twentieth-century creation. Literary scholars led the way in\nestablishing the contemporary scholarship, but recently scholars\nattuned to the very different character of philosophy and science in\nthe eighteenth century have begun to return to Diderot\u2019s work,\nfinding in it the complex and sophisticated thinking that was his\nhallmark.\n\nDiderot is now actively studied by both literary scholars and\nintellectual historians alike, and there was even a movement afoot as\nrecently as 2013 to enshrine Diderot alongside Rousseau, Voltaire, and\nCondorcet in the Panth\u00e9on of French national heroes. Headlines\nworrying about \u201cun homme dangereux au\nPanth\u00e9on?\u201d revealed the continuing influence of his\nalleged infamy, yet the twenty-first century may be the moment when\nDiderot is finally recognized as the important eighteenth-century\nphilosopher that he was.\n\nFor a more complete biography of Diderot, see the\n Biographical Supplement.\n",
