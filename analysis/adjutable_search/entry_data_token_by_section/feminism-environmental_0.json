    "main_text": "Key Terms and Distinctions || Nature Is A Feminist Issue\n1.1 Nature Is A Feminist Issue\n\nA feminist issue provides ways of understanding, eliminating, and\ncreating alternatives to the oppression of women. Minimally, nature\n(used interchangeably in this essay with \u201cthe\nenvironment\u201d) is a feminist issue because an understanding of\nnature and environmental problems often helps one understand how and\nwhy women's oppression is linked with the unjustified domination or\nexploitation of nature. (The distinction between\n\u201coppression\u201d and \u201cdomination\u201d is discussed\nin Section 3.2.) For example, data show that\nwomen\u2014especially poor, rural women in less developed countries\n(LDCs) who are heads of households\u2014suffer disproportionate harms\ncaused by such environmental problems as deforestation, water\npollution, and environmental toxins. Knowing this helps one understand\nhow the lives and status of women are connected to contemporary\nenvironmental problems. (Greta Gaard and Lori Gruen 2005).  Such data\nmake deforestation, water pollution, and environmental toxins a\nfeminist issue. In fact, some have claimed that \u201cnature is a\nfeminist issue\u201d might be the informal slogan of feminist\nenvironmental philosophy (Warren 2000).\n",
