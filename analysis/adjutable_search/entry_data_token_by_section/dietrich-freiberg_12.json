    "main_text": "The Agent Intellect and the Soul\n13. The Agent Intellect and the Soul\n\n\nDietrich\u2019s account of the relationship of consciousness to the agent\nintellect in terms of causation raises another question for his theory\nof intellect, namely, what kind of causal relationship exists between\nthe agent intellect and the soul? Dietrich gives a very precise answer\nto this question based no doubt on his acceptance of Proclus\u2019\nexposition of the principles of generation within the hierarchy of\nbeing. The agent intellect, according to this explanation, is the\nintrinsic efficient cause of the soul. That it cannot be the material\ncause Dietrich thinks is self-evident. It cannot be the final cause\nsince a final cause perfects a thing, but does not establish it in\nbeing, which is what the agent intellect does for the soul. But it is\nmore important to understand, Dietrich insists, that the agent\nintellect cannot be the formal cause of the soul\u2014at least not in the\nnatural order of things. He argues that if it was the formal cause of\nthe soul, given that the soul by definition is the formal cause of the\nhuman person, then it would follow that there would be a form of a\nform in the same genus, man. But this is contrary to the natural order\nof things because whatever is the form of something in the genus of\nsubstance is by the whole of itself the act of its subject. Thus the\nsame thing cannot be in potency to more than one form in its genus.\nPerhaps we can understand Dietrich\u2019s remarks about the vision of St.\nBenedict mentioned above in terms of this analysis. Man is not\n\u201cfully joined\u201d to his intellect in the sense that the\nintellect is not his form. If it were his form, he, like Benedict,\nwould understand the entire universe of beings in a single mental\nact. But such a vision belongs to the order of grace, not to the order\nof natural providence.\n\n\nThe soul of man, then, living in time, only participates in its agent\nintellect. It acquires the universe of beings only piecemeal as it\nwere. More and more with each act of understanding it approaches the\nunderstanding of the universe of beings, a universe that is its\nuniverse, which it possesses as a capacity of its own nature.\n",
