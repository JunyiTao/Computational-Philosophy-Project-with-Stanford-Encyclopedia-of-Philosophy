    "main_text": "Liberal Democracy || The Scope of the Franchise and Weighted Voting\n4.2 The Scope of the Franchise and Weighted Voting\n\nIn his philosophical writings and in his service as a Liberal member\nof Parliament for Westminster from 1865 to 1868, Mill was a vigorous\nadvocate for extending the franchise. Though he recognized some limits\nin the scope of the franchise, he was a consistent, though not always\nsuccessful, advocate for its extension beyond its then\ncurrent scope. He supported extending the franchise to previously\ndisenfranchised members of the working class, and he was a staunch\nadvocate for female suffrage (479\u201381). To many, such views about\nthe appropriate scope of the franchise seemed quite radical. Though\nMill did support weighted voting, he may have seen this, at least in\npart, as a necessary concession to succeed in securing his primary\nobjective of (near) universal suffrage (476). It is worth bearing this\ncontext in mind when evaluating Mill\u2019s proposals for the scope\nand weight of the franchise.\n\nAs we noted earlier, Mill does not defend representative democracy as\nideal under all historical and social circumstances. There are some\nsocial circumstances, he thinks, in which democracy will not promote\nthe common good. These are backward states of society in which most\ncitizens are unfit to rule, because they lack necessary ingredients of\nthe culture of autonomy to exercise decision-making authority\nresponsibly. They lack discipline, or education, or an active and\nindependent character. Different forms of government are appropriate\nfor such backward states of advancement. In particular, Mill thinks\nthat benevolent rule by an enlightened one or few, which aimed at the\ncommon good, would be better suited for such societies (415\u201318).\nHere, Mill is introducing a scope limitation on the defense of\npolitical rights that he recognized explicitly in his defense of basic\nliberties in On Liberty (I 10). There are important practical\nquestions, which Mill does not address very clearly, about which\nsocieties cross this threshold of capacity for improvement by free\ninquiry and political rights. We might reasonably disagree with\nMill about what the competence threshold is and which societies\nsatisfy \n it.[2] \n But he does make clear that political participation, like free\ninquiry, is important as a necessary condition for the exercise of our\nhigher capacities and has value only when a threshold level of\nnormative competence is met.\n\nWhat is true of some societies in relation to others is also true of\nsome individuals in relation to others within societies that cross\nthis threshold of normative competence. This explains limitations on\nthe scope of the franchise that Mill recognizes within such advanced\ncivilizations. He confines the scope of the franchise to mature\nadults, excluding minors who would not have crossed the threshold of\nnormative competence. He is also prepared to exclude those adults who\nare not literate (CRG 470\u201371). This is a failure of\nnormative competence for which society is to blame and which it is\nsociety\u2019s duty to correct (470). Mill also excludes from the\nfranchise those adults who do not pay taxes and are on public\nassistance (472). Here he expresses the concern that voting gives one\na say not only over one\u2019s own life but also over the lives of\nothers and that without contributing to the production of an economic\nsurplus one has no right to help determine how this surplus is\ndistributed. Mill is also committed to doubts about the normative\ncompetence of those on public assistance. Elsewhere, Mill insists that\ncharities make beneficiaries dependent on benefactors in ways that\ncompromise their autonomy and independence (PPE V.xi.13;\nSW 330). Insofar as this is true, it provides an additional\nrationale for excluding dependents from the franchise.\n\nThe main limitations on the scope of the franchise that Mill\nrecognizes track this threshold of normative competence. Mill thinks\nthat the reasons for favoring democracy apply to all those above this\nnormative threshold. Literate manual laborers have the same claim to\nthe franchise, Mill thinks, as anyone else. They need to stand up for\ntheir own interests and make sure they are properly reckoned in\npolitical decision-making. Moreover, they stand to benefit from\npolitical participation, because of the way it develops their\ndeliberative capacities.\n\nOf course, there are differences in normative competence among those\nabove this threshold. But Mill\u2019s account of representative\ndemocracy tracks these further differences in terms of the\nweight, rather than the scope, of the franchise\n(CRG 473). Differences in normative competence above this\nthreshold should affect the comparative weight of one\u2019s vote.\nThis scheme of weighted voting takes the form of a system of plural\nvotes (CRG 467\u201381; also see \u201cParliamentary\nReform\u201d 322\u201328). Mill emphatically rejects property\nqualifications as suitable proxies for normative competence\n(CRG 474; \u201cParliamentary Reform\u201d 325) and insists\non educational qualifications.\n\n\nThe most direct mode of effecting this, would be to establish the\nplurality of votes, in favour of those who could afford a reasonable\npresumption of superior knowledge and cultivation. \u2026 The\nperfection, then, of an electoral system would be, that every person\nshould have one vote, but that every well-educated person in the\ncommunity should have more than one, on a scale corresponding as far\nas practicable to their amount of education. (\u201cParliamentary\nReform\u201d 324\u201325)\n\n\nThere is an upper limit on the system of plural votes such that the\nweighted votes of the educational elite will not give them a majority\ncoalition that could advance its class interests at the expense of the\nuneducated (CRG 476).\n\nMill\u2019s commitment to weighted voting reflects his views about\nthe backward state of the working classes.\n\n\nThe opinions and wishes of the poorest and rudest class of labourers\nmay be very useful as one influence among others on the minds of the\nvoters, as well as on those of the Legislature; and yet it may be\nhighly mischievous to give them the preponderant influence, but\nadmitting them, in their present state of morals and intelligence, to\nthe full exercise of the suffrage. (\u201cParliamentary Reform\u201d\n334)\n\n\nDespite these doubts about the working classes, Mill regarded himself\nas their friend (Autobiography 274; see Ten 1998). Mill did\nnot blame the working classes for what he saw as their lesser\ncompetence, and he did not regard their backwardness as a natural\nor permanent condition. He thought that improved access to quality\nprimary and secondary education and greater scope for civic\nparticipation would gradually improve normative competence in the\nworking classes (PPE IV.vii.2). Insofar as this is true, the\nqualification to Mill\u2019s commitment to political equality,\nrepresented by his scheme of weighted voting, is temporary and\ntransitional. In this sense, weighted voting is not part of ideal\npolitical theory in the way that (near) universal suffrage and\nproportional representation are.\n\nEven if weighted voting tracks the epistemic reasons for democracy and\ndifferences in underlying normative competence, it violates norms of\npolitical equality. Mill seems not to recognize the potentially\ncorrosive effects of weighted voting in terms of the message it sends\nof second-class citizenship to the working classes. He thinks that\nself-respect requires only that one have the vote, not that one have\nan equal vote, regardless of normative competence.\n\n\nThere is not, in this arrangement [weighted voting], anything\nnecessarily invidious to those to whom it assigns the lower degrees of\ninfluence. Entire exclusion from a voice in the common concerns is one\nthing; the concession to others of a more potential voice, on the\nground of greater capacity for the management of the joint interests,\nis another. The two things are not merely different, they are\nincommensurable. Everyone has a right to feel insulted by being made a\nnobody, and stamped as of no account at all. No one but a fool\n\u2026 feels offended by the acknowledgment that there are others\nwhose opinion \u2026 is entitled to a greater amount of\nconsideration than his. (CRG 474)\n\n\nBut why should I care so much about being branded a nobody and not at\nall about being branded a lesser somebody? One might well want to\nharness the resources and expertise of an educated elite, perhaps, as\nMill already imagines, by giving them special roles in the drafting of\nlegislation or in setting the agenda for public deliberations. But\nthis does not require giving the educated elite plural votes. Doing\nthat seems to have significant symbolic value, saying that working\nclasses should have less political standing and say. From this\nperspective, Mill displays something of a tin ear for\negalitarian concerns about weighted voting. Interestingly, while\nhe does not seem especially sensitive to concerns about the bad\neffects of second-class citizenship in Considerations on\nRepresentative Government, he seems much more sensitive to such\nconcerns in The Subjection of Women. As we will see, Mill is\nacutely aware of the variety of ways in which women\u2019s\ncontributions can be discouraged and undervalued and of the individual\nand social costs of women\u2019s second-class status. Had Mill been\nas mindful of the costs of according workers second-class citizenship\nas he would later be of the costs of according women second-class\nstatus, he might have been more skeptical of weighted voting than he\nin fact was.\n",
