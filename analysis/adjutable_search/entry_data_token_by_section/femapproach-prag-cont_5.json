Recent Scholarship and Future Directions\n\nCompared to continental feminism, pragmatist feminism is a small\n field.[5]\n It is growing, however, and as it does so, the chances that more work\non the intersections of feminism, pragmatism, and continental\nphilosophy will be produced also increase. To date, one common thread\nthat loosely unites feminist cross-fertilizations of continental and\npragmatist philosophy is its criticism of oppositional, exclusionary\nbinaries; another is a commitment to philosophical work that engages\nwith lived experience and everyday life. In this closing section, we\noutline possible avenues for future work in pragmatist and continental\nfeminism, and highlight recent developments in the field.\n6.1 Bodies and Embodiment\n\nFor over two decades, understanding the relationship between\nembodiment and gender, race, and sexuality has been an important topic\nfor continental feminists, especially Susan Bordo (1993), Judith\nButler (1990 and 1994), Elizabeth Grosz (1994), and Gail Weiss (1999).\nIn Living Across and Through Skins: Transactional Bodies,\nPragmatism and Feminism (2001), Shannon Sullivan engages Butler\u2019s\nand (to a lesser degree) Bordo\u2019s work, along with that of\nMerleau-Ponty, Nietzsche, and Dewey, to argue for a feminist\nconception of bodily life as transactional. Sullivan presents bodies\nas dynamically constituted in and through relationships with their\npolitical, social, material, and other environments, and she does so\nfor the purpose of exploring which bodies transactional processes\nbenefit and harm and thus whether those processes should be embraced\nor transformed by feminists and others.\n\nLadelle McWhorter\u2019s Bodies and Pleasures: Foucault and the\nPolitics of Sexual Normalization (1999) does not explicitly\nappeal to pragmatist philosophy, but its affinities with pragmatist\nmethods and concerns can be drawn out. McWhorter argues that the value\nof Foucault\u2019s philosophy should not be judged by the truth (or\nfalsity) of what it says, a method of evaluation that relies upon what\nRorty (1979) calls \u201cthe mirror of nature.\u201d In its place,\nMcWhorter asks feminist and other readers of Foucault to pragmatically\njudge his work on what it does, that is, on the transformative impact\nthat it has on their lives. Using her own life as a text, McWhorter\n\u201ctakes an experience of reading Foucault\u2019s works as [her] point\nof analysis\u201d (1999, xix) and demonstrates the feminist-friendly\neffects of Foucault\u2019s particular account of bodies, pleasures, and the\nformation of sexual subjects.\n\nFoucault also is the focal point of Cressida J. Heyes\u2019s\nSelf-Transformations: Foucault, Ethics, and Normalized Bodies\n(2007). As Heyes asks with Foucault how growth in a\nperson\u2019s capacities can be separated from increased docility\nwithin power relations, she draws on Richard Shusterman\u2019s\npragmatist somaesthetics. A bodily discipline that both critically\nstudies and uses sensory-aesthetic appreciation to improve lived\nexperience, somaesthetics can be a point of\n\u201ccounterattack\u201d (2007, 123) that helps a person care for\nher embodied self in ways that increase her freedom. It does this by\nteaching non-normative ways of experiencing and evaluating one\u2019s\nbodily experiences, increasing the capacity of what one can think and\ndo. Through her concrete examples of yoga and other bodily practices,\nHeyes draws on continental and pragmatist philosophy to take \u201ca\nfirst step toward creating grander feminist projects from existing\nsomaesthetic practices\u201d (2007, 136).\n\nMarjorie Jolles, in contrast, doubts that Shusterman\u2019s\npragmatism can provide the critical counterpoint to bodily\nnormalization that both Foucault and feminist philosophy need. This is\nbecause bodily experience is shaped by the very normalizing forces\nthat it is supposed to challenge. Responding to Heyes in \u201cBetween\nEmbodied Subjects and Objects: Narrative Somaesthetics\u201d (2012), Jolles\nargues that \u201cShusterman does not go far enough in establishing\nsomaesthetics\u2019 suitability of Foucauldian feminist efforts to\nshape one\u2019s life\u201d in anti- and non-normative ways (2012,\n307). Proposing an alternative to Shusterman\u2019s somaesthetics,\nJolles develops what she calls narrative somaesthetics. Modeled on\nfeminist consciousness-raising, narrative somaesthetics incorporates\ninto somatic practices narrative work that helps disrupt\nnormalization. On Jolles\u2019s view, by combining discursive and bodily\npractices, feminist philosophy will have a better shot at countering\nthe harmful somatic effects of sexist oppression.\n\nPragmatist resources for thinking about embodiment also is the subject\nof Maurice Hamington\u2019s (2004) Embodied Care: Jane Addams, Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty, and Feminist Ethics. In that book, Hamington\nargues that human bodies are built for care and that care can only be\nunderstood properly in conjunction with its embodied dimensions.\nDistinguishing care\u2014a contextual, corporeal, interdependent way\nof being in the world\u2014from the theory of care ethics, Hamington\nintersects Merleau-Ponty\u2019s phenomenology of bodily habits with\nAmerican pragmatist Jane Addams\u2019 embodied practices of democracy and\ncitizenship to demonstrate the body\u2019s centrality to feminist ethics.\nDeveloping the concepts of caring habits, caring knowledge, and caring\nimagination, Hamington affirms Jane Addams\u2019 \u201csimple yet powerful\nmandate that we boldly experience one another\u201d through our\nembodied practices of care (2004, 145).\n\nFinally, some feminists emphasize the practical value of\nphenomenological and pragmatic accounts of embodiment and the self for\nsolving specific problems in the real world. Jennifer Hansen, for\nexample, in her contributions to the philosophy of psychiatry, has\nemphasized the therapeutic value of a conception of the habitual body\nand the narrative self for the treatment of individuals with bipolar\ndisorder. Though such individuals may experience self-distrust as a\nresult of difficulty with seeing themselves \u201cas consistent\nagents\u201d (2013, 69) brought on by challenges with identifying with\ntheir past actions in either manic or depressive states, Hansen argues\nthat clinicians can assist patients build a coherent sense of self by\nincorporating insights about habitual embodiment. Drawing on Grosz and\nIris M. Young\u2019s (2005) feminist phenomenology, as well as James\u2019s\naccount of habit as central to embodied selfhood, Hansen suggests that\nthe habitual body\u2019s capacity to engage with the world in consistent,\ngoal-directed ways, despite doing so unconsciously, provides an\ninroad to a self-concept that is coherent. Although such habitual\nmoments (of, for example, opening familiar doors or performing special\nlearned skills like CPR) are often performed unconsciously, we can\nbegin to notice and appreciate them \u201cif others, such as a clinician,\npoints them out to us\u201d (2013, 72.) Although such recognition may seem\na small step, they could be useful as patients begin to cultivate\nself-trust. Clinicians, moreover, may assist patients in recognizing\nthat even seemingly rudimentary habits have significance in creating a\nsense of self: \u201cAlthough the habitual body of a bipolar patient may\nnot have a habitual moral character, she may, for example, have a\nhabit of recycling\u201d (72). The recognition of such habits could be\nbeneficial in beginning to build self-trust. Traditional views of\npsychiatry may view individuals with bipolar disorder as incapable of\n\u201ccoherent\u201d selfhood in the ordinary sense of the word, but Hansen\nshows that feminist phenomenological and pragmatic \u201caccounts of\nembodiment show another way in which bipolar selves can be coherent:\nthey cohere in habitual bodies\u201d (73).\n 6.2 The Concept of the Other  \n\nThe concept of the Other offers a potential site for productive\ndiscussion and disagreement between feminist, pragmatist, and\ncontinental philosophers. As Charlene Haddock Seigfried notes,\n\u201c[p]ragmatists tend to celebrate otherness by seeking out and\nwelcoming difference as an expression of creative subjectivity\u201d\n(1996, 267). The optimistic tone that pragmatism often takes toward\nalterity is markedly different from that of Julia Kristeva\u2019s claim\nthat one is always other to oneself: \u201cForeigner: a choked up\nrage deep down in my throat. By recognizing him within ourselves, we\nare spared detesting him in himself\u201d (1991, 1). Contemporary\npragmatist feminists have tended to be more skeptical than most\ncanonical pragmatists of the category of the Other because they\nrecognize it as a means of domination. Yet, influenced by pragmatism,\nthose feminists tend not to construe the Other in as alienating and\nforeboding way as Kristeva does. Pragmatist and continental philosophy\nthus presents feminists with a variety of resources for thinking\nthrough the benefits and dangers of different conceptions of the\nOther, including the role of the Other in the constitution of both\nself and community.\n\nCynthia Gayman (2011) and Erin C. Tarver (2013), for example, have\nargued that women\u2019s constitution as subjects in a social milieu of\noppressive gender relations ironically opens the possibility for\nchange and subversion. Tarver\u2019s argument proceeds by bringing a\nDeweyan account of habit to bear on Judith Butler\u2019s theory of gender\nas performative, whereas Gayman puts Dewey in dialog with Foucault.\nSpecifically, Gayman combines a Foucaultian account of the gendered\nsubject with a Deweyan insistence that critical investigation happens\n\u201cby recognition of a problem, which in turn provokes the kind of\nreflexive activity leading to recognition that what is, does not have\nto be\u201d (2011, 67). Because the individual is constituted through her\ninteractions and transactions with others in the world, the\nrecognition of problems necessarily occurs through everyday\nexperiences and interactions. It is not that others are themselves\nproblems; rather, the encounters in our world that cause us to stumble\nprovoke us to ask questions about how to proceed. They, as Gayman puts\nit following Foucault and Colin Koopman (2011), provoke a\n\u201cproblematization\u201d (67). Thus, for Gayman, although patterns of gender\nsubordination that women encounter as they become subjects in and\nthrough interaction with others in the social world must be resisted,\n\u201cto be resisted they must be seen, that is, recognized in the first\nplace, which means they must be  experienced , as well as \nproblematized\u201d (75). Encounter with the other, which happens\nnecessarily through experience, is therefore necessary for the\ndevelopment of feminist consciousness. \n 6.3 Refiguring the Future: The Unconscious Imaginary \n\nIn psychoanalytic terms, the imaginary is the collection of (largely)\nunconscious fantasies and images that shapes both individual subjects\nand their worlds. In different ways, the work of both Donna Haraway\nand Luce Irigaray seeks to reveal the male privilege and domination\ncontained within the current imaginary so that a space for a different\nsort of imaginary might be opened for the future. Although Irigaray is\nthe better known for it, both she and Haraway appropriate the image of\nthe speculum in this process, appealing to the gynecological mirror as\nan \u201cinstrument for rendering a part accessible to\nobservation\u201d (Haraway 1997, 197) and revealing how the feminine\ninstrument is not itself reflected in its work of mirroring others\n(Irigaray 1985). While Haraway \u201cexcavate[s] something like a\ntechnoscientific unconscious\u201d (1997, 151), Irigaray investigates\nthe psychoanalytic \u201cscience that still cannot make up its\nmind\u201d about \u201cwoman, science\u2019s unknown\u201d (1985, 15,\n13). Their work thus offers interesting resources for uncovering a\npatriarchal culture\u2019s blind spots and transforming its unconscious\nimaginary, as well as raises important questions about the role that\nscience can or should play in feminist theorizing of the\n future.[6]\n\nNo\u00eblle McAfee also draws on psychoanalytic theory to analyze the\nunconscious operations of democratic societies. In Democracy and\nthe Political Unconscious (2008), McAfee blends poststructural\npsychoanalysis, feminist philosophy, and semiotics with Deweyan,\nRawlsian, and Habermasian democratic theories. The result is a\nsophisticated argument that when some members of a society are denied\nthe ability to participate in the public sphere, that society will\ntend to develop a political unconscious. As McAfee explains, the\npolitical unconscious is not a thing or a place, but rather \u201can\neffect of processes: failures to sublimate well, desires\nunarticulated, voices kept silent, repressions reenacted without\nacknowledgement of their origins\u201d (2008, 12). Understanding with Dewey that the public is called into\nbeing by particular problems and that it can have difficulty finding\nitself when those problems are immense, McAfee develops democratic\nstrategies for public processes of mourning so that age-old traumas of\nrepression and exclusion no longer are compulsively repeated.\n 6.4 The Epistemology of Resistance \n\nLike McAfee, Jos\u00e9 Medina draws on several thinkers in both the\ncontinental and pragmatist traditions to argue for a feminist response\nto oppressive socio-political conditions. Unlike McAfee, however,\nMedina conceives the project of resistance to oppression as\nfundamentally epistemological in nature. The reason for this is that,\nas he argues in The Epistemology of Resistance (2013), while\ndemocratic practice requires collective engagement, \u201cin contexts of\nsexual and racial oppression there are cognitive-affective deficits\nthat amount to specific forms of epistemic insensitivity: the\ninability to listen to and learn from others, the inability to call\ninto question one\u2019s perspective and to process epistemic friction\nexerted from significantly different perspectives\u201d (2013, 17\u201318). Such\ndeficits undermine the possibility of genuine democratic engagement\nand prevent the privileged in particular of recognizing the\nsocio-political injustices in which they are complicit. However,\nMedina\u2019s epistemological project is both critical and constructive.\nDrawing especially on the work of Foucault and James, he articulates a\nvision of the epistemological practices we must take up in order to\nresist oppression, for \u201cepistemic and sociopolitical melioration\ngo hand in hand\u201d (301). \n\nMedina argues that knowers have a \u201cshared responsibility with respect\nto epistemic justice for the correction of blind spots and social\ninsensitivities associated with racism and (hetero)sexism\u201d (2013, 25),\nsuggesting that those subjects whose privilege prevents them from\ndeveloping knowledge of or sensitivity to experiences beyond their own\nhave an obligation to unsettle their epistemic ease by seeking out\n\u201cepistemic friction\u201d and \u201ccultivat[ing] a resistant imagination\u201d (26) that\nwould sensitize them to the experiences of marginalized and\nstigmatized subjects. The prescription that Medina offers for\naccomplishing such cultivation, which he terms \u201cguerilla pluralism\u201d\n(284), is inspired by a combination of insights from Foucault and\nJames. Both Foucault and James conceive truth and knowledge as plural\nand as the product of particular interests and purposes. One of the\nkey ways in which they differ, however, is in the implications of this\nview of knowledge that they emphasize: whereas James offers a\n\u201cmelioristic pluralism,\u201d in which epistemic contestations and\nnegotiations are directed toward improving the objectivity of the\ndifferent standpoints available, toward correcting their biases and\nmistakes, and toward \u201cmaintain[ing] their truth alive\u201d (283),\nFoucault\u2019s genealogical approach offers a less rosy view of the\npossibilities of epistemic melioration, and aims less at learning than\nunlearning received ways of viewing the world. Foucault, then, would\nhave us \u201cresurrect counter-memories, not just for the sake of joint\ncooperation, but for the sake of reactivating struggles and energizing\nforms of resistance\u201d (284). Drawing from Foucault the importance of\nspecific mechanisms to break down settled regimes of power/knowledge\nand from James the imperative to find a way to move forward in\nimproving the social conditions in which we live, Medina advocates the\nformation of a resistant social imagination through genealogical\ninvestigations: \u201cgenealogical investigations constitute critical\ninterventions in the social imagination that can help us make our\nsense of a shared past more pluralistic and open to diversity\u201d (292).\nThis is not to say, however, that the end point of such investigations\nwill be the total overcoming of oppression or even of culpable shared\nignorance. Rather, in a pragmatic vein, Medina emphasizes a\nfallibilist approach to investigation that remains open to correction\nand critique through \u201cradical solidarity: the cultivation of an\never-expanding accountability and responsiveness to indefinitely many\nothers, which is required by a resistant epistemic agency\u201d (302). Such\nfallibilism, unlike radical relativism in which \u201cany way of framing\nand interpreting is as good as any other,\u201d is committed to producing a\nresistant imagination characterized by its exertion of \u201cbeneficial\nepistemic friction\u201d (303) that is aimed at continual self-correction\nand resistance to oppression and the ignorance that necessarily\naccompanies it.\n\nCelia T. Bardwell-Jones (2018) makes use of Medina\u2019s epistemology of\nresistance to theorize the conflict between hospital administrators\nand Native Hawaiian mothers in policies regarding the treatment of the\nplacenta after hospital births in Hawai\u2019i. Before 2006, as\nBardwell-Jones explains, hospitals regarded the placenta as hazardous\nhuman waste, which needed to be disposed of as a threat to public\nhealth. This put hospital policy in direct conflict with Native\nHawaiian practice, which required burying the placenta in a ceremony\nafter birth, as a means of affirming the connection of the infant with\nthe environment and community from which they came. Because of the\nlasting legacy of colonialism in Hawai\u2019i, this conflict was\nunhelpfully framed as a conflict between \u201cmodern\u201d and\n\u201ctraditional\u201d views of health (which, as Bardwell points\nout, ignores the fact that many Native Hawaiian mothers do in fact\nvalue modern hospitals and choose to give birth in them). The dominant\nbiomedical view that barred taking home the placenta, moreover, relied\n\u201con an assumption of epistemological superiority\u201d\n(106). Following Medina, Bardwell-Jones argues that this biomedical\napproach\u2019s privileged position left it epistemically insensitive to\nNative Hawaiian knowledges about the moral value of a sense of place\nand community. To overcome such insensitivities, she suggests,\nhospital administrators should do as Medina says and aim to cultivate\nepistemic friction\u2014or, as she puts its, \u201cperplexity\u201d\n(107)\u2014by seeking out genuine engagement with differentially\nsituated others. Doing so is useful not only for the purpose of\nadequately serving the community in which the hospital is located, but\nalso for beginning to recognize when existing health care policy is in\nfact \u201cinformed by a state of moral panic\u201d (110) that can\nsurround public health discussions, but of which the medical\nestablishment may very well be unaware.\n6.5 Expanding the Canon\n\nThe expansion of the canon of \u201cclassical\u201d American\nphilosophy to include more than white men opens up new possibilities\nfor feminist intersections of continental and pragmatist philosophy.\nCynthia Willett\u2019s The Soul of Justice: Social Bonds and Racial\nHubris (2001) is a good example of one such possibility. In this\nbook, Willett critically intersects G.W.F. Hegel and Luce Irigaray\n(among others) with the \u201cvisionary pragmatism\u201d (2001, 175)\nof African-American thinkers such as Toni Morrison and Patricia Hill\nCollins to present an account of freedom based in social bonds.\nRejecting modernity\u2019s and psychoanalysis\u2019s account of separation as\ncrucial to the formation of subjectivity, Willet draws on accounts of\nslavery to show how the destruction of erotic connections through the\nviolence of separation results in social death. With this account,\nWillett suggests how an expanded understanding of American pragmatism\nthat includes black women can combine with continental philosophy to\nproduce a feminist and anti-racist liberatory theory that appreciates\nthe constitutive role that desire plays in social relationships. In\nrecent years, additionally, Collins (2012; 2019) herself has written\non the value of an explicit dialogue between intersectionality theory\nfounded by women of color and classical pragmatist conceptions of\ncommunity, writing that \u201ceach discourse speaks to gaps in the other\u201d\n(2012, 444). Collins specifically argues that pragmatism offers\nintersectionality a means of forming a robust conceptualization of the\nrelation between individuals and broader social structures, as well as\na potential site of political action, whereas intersectionality offers\npragmatists a framework for conceptualizing actually existing power\nrelations, an explicit analytic of which pragmatism has historically\nlacked. The insights that emerge from this dialogue are of crucial\nsignificance to the anti-oppressive project: \u201cto grow,\nintersectionality must become an intellectual leader. It is compelled\nto build something anew, drawing from knowledge projects such as Black\nfeminist thought and American pragmatism without defining itself in\nopposition to them\u2026commit[ting] to an open-ended process of creative\nsocial action, incorporating the ideas and actions of these and other\nknowledge projects into its own praxis\u201d (2019, 188). \n\nWillett continues to intersect continental, pragmatist, and feminist\nwork in Irony in the Age of Empire: Comic Perspectives on\nDemocracy and Freedom (2008). Willett\u2019s ongoing interest in\nquestions of freedom lead her to examine how it can be supported and\nencouraged by comedy, including social ridicule, satire, and\ncarnivalesque laughter. As Willett ranges widely from philosophy to\nfilm and television to political tragedies, she draws on the\ntragicomic philosophy of Cornel West to develop an \u201caugmented\npragmatism, inflected fully by the comic spirit,\u201d in order to\n\u201cprovid[e] the philosophical basis for reconceptualizing\nfreedom\u201d (2008, 16). Willett also puts Jean-Paul Sartre and\nHenri Bergson in conversation with Ralph Ellison and filmmaker Spike\nLee to explore how satire can help nurture an emancipatory political\nethics.  The result is a feminist-infused account of democracy and\nfreedom that appreciates the politically transformative possibilities\nof comedy.\n\nIn \u201cHow is This Paper Philosophy?\u201d Kristie Dotson (2012) takes this\nexpansion further. Dotson considers professional philosophy and its\npersistent failure to recruit women of color and other \u201cdiverse\npractitioners\u201d (5), arguing that this failure is symptomatic of a\n\u201cculture of justification\u201d (6) in the discipline, which\nemphasizes legitimation and presumes the norms of that legitimation\nare univocal amongst all subjects. Dotson considers the testimony of\nblack feminists and phenomenologists, including Donna-Dale Marcano\n(2010) and Gayle Salamon (2009) to highlight the feelings of\n\u201cincongruence\u201d (Dotson 2012, 13) that many diverse practitioners\nexperience when confronted with these supposedly univocal norms, which\noften conflict with their lived experiences. In response, Dotson\nargues for the cultivation of \u201ca culture of praxis,\u201d in the discipline\nof philosophy, in which we value investigation of \u201cissues and\ncircumstances pertinent to our living,\u201d recognizing that this will\nvary considerably depending on populations, as well as \u201crecognition\nand encouragement of multiple canons and multiple ways of\nunderstanding disciplinary validation\u201d (17). In so doing, Dotson\nargues, philosophy would thereby admit a diversity of concerns,\nmethods, and canons, not for the sake of rendering all contributions\nequal, but for the sake of investigating which contributions might be\n\u201cuseful for some projects and irrelevant for others.\u201d The upshot of\nsuch a cultivation would not only be to allow philosophy as a\ndiscipline to benefit from the ideas of diverse practitioners, but to\nmake philosophy itself better able to present \u201clivable options\u201d (26)\nto those practitioners, and to black women in particular. \n 6.6 The Limits of Feminist Intersections of Pragmatist and Continental Philosophy\n\nOne of the effects of Nancy Fraser\u2019s work in social and political\nphilosophy and critical theory has been to raise questions about the\nbenefit to feminists of drawing upon certain strands of continental\nphilosophy. For example, Fraser finds value in the theories of\nthinkers such as Foucault, Bourdieu, and Habermas (among others)\nbecause their notions of discourse include a rich array of\nhistorically embedded social practices (1997, 151\u2013152). By\ncontrast, Fraser claims that \u201cfeminists should have no truck\nwith the versions of discourse theory that they attribute to [Jacques]\nLacan [and] only the most minimal truck with related theories\nattributed to Julia Kristeva\u201d (1997, 151). This is because\nFraser views Lacan and Kristeva as reducing the variety of forms of\nhuman communication to language narrowly understood as a symbolic\nsystem. Given the variety of continental theories that feminists might\nengage, Fraser argues that what is needed is a \u201cpragmatics\nmodel\u201d (1997, 155). Also called \u201cneo-pragmatism\u201d by\nFraser (in Benhabib, et al. 1995, 167), such a model would allow\nfeminists to separate the wheat from the chaff in continental\nphilosophy and incorporate the best it has to offer into feminist\ntheory (1997, 208). Fraser thus uses pragmatism as a method by which\nto discriminate between different continental theories, and in so\ndoing, raises the broader question of the relative advantages and\ndisadvantages for feminism of intersecting pragmatist and continental\nphilosophy.\n\nSimilarly, Erin C. Tarver has argued that pragmatists should be wary\nof importing James\u2019s views wholesale, and on the contrary, that\nelements of James\u2019s philosophy that presuppose a masculine subject or\na too-robust vision of individual autonomy must be \u201crecognized and\nrejected\u201d (2015, 99). The reason for this is that such presuppositions\nare often not merely sexist, but have profound ontological and ethical\nimplications that would further entrench anti-feminist social\nhierarchies. Yet, Tarver frames this willingness to revise or\nselectively draw from certain elements of James\u2019s thought as\nconsistent with pragmatic fallibilism. She writes, \u201cWe must be willing\nto take James\u2019s fallibilism and deference to new evidence seriously\nenough to apply it to his own works\u201d (100) rather than dismissing\nmasculine language and assumptions as regrettable instances of sexism\nthat can be overlooked as the product of another time. Thus, according\nto Tarver, feminist philosophical engagement with pragmatism must be\nwilling to critique and reject, even when engaging with thinkers whose\nideas can be useful for feminist aims. \n\nThis list of possible topics in the area of feminist intersections of\npragmatist and continental philosophy certainly is not comprehensive,\nnor are the possibilities contained within it fully fleshed out. That\nwork awaits others interested in this new field. The forms that it\nwill take remain to be seen and are eagerly awaited.",
