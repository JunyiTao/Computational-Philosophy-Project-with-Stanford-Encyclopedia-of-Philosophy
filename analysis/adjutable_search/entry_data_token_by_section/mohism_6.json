    "main_text": "Ethical Theory\n7. Ethical Theory\n\n\nEarly Mohist writings have a practical, not theoretical orientation.\nThe Mohists wrote political tracts aimed at persuading rulers,\nofficials, and gentlemen to adopt their ethical and political\ndoctrines, not abstract inquiries into ethical theory. In the course of\narguing for their doctrines, however, they present a loose yet\nsophisticated form of consequentialism, an updated version of which\nwould merit critical attention today. The leading principle \u2014 or as\nthey think of it, fa (model, standard) \u2014 of their ethics is\nthat people should have an attitude of \u201cinclusive care\u201d (jian\nai) toward others and in their interactions seek to benefit\n(l\u00ec) each other. In this way, we promote \u201cthe benefit\nof all under\n heaven.\u201d[13]\n\n\nThe Mohists do not attempt to ground all ethical values or judgments\non a single, fundamental good or principle, such as happiness or the\nmoral law. Instead, plausibly, their theory is based on a loose notion\nof human welfare comprising a plurality of basic goods. Nor do they\nsuggest that the ethical standards they propose will automatically\nresolve all moral problems, without the need for practical wisdom or\ntrade-offs between goods. But they do hold, again plausibly, that a\nreflective, self-aware moral life demands that we develop some form of\nnormative theory, some account of what practices are right and wrong\nand the reasons why.\n\n\nThe Mohist ethical theory bears a similarity to rule utilitarianism,\nbut is probably better characterized as \u201cpractice consequentialism\u201d or,\neven more appropriately, \u201cdao (way) consequentialism.\u201d For the\nMohists, as for other classical Chinese thinkers, the salient unit of\nhuman activity and the focus of ethical reflection is not individual\nacts but dao (way), a general notion referring to a way,\nstyle, or pattern of life or of performing some kind of activity.\nDao may be very broad in scope, including practices,\ninstitutions, and traditions, along with the rules, techniques, styles,\nattitudes, and dispositions associated with them. Since, as a way of\nlife, a dao includes dispositions, and thus virtues, Mohist\nconsequentialism incorporates some of the characteristics of motive\nconsequentialism.\n\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 primary concern, then, is not to provide a theory by\nwhich to judge whether particular acts are right or wrong, but to\nidentify \u201cthe dao (way) of the benevolent (ren) and right\n(yi).\u201d To the Mohists, the defining feature of this\ndao is that it promotes the welfare or \u201cbenefit\u201d\n(l\u00ec) of and eliminates harm to everyone in society.\n\u201cBenefit\u201d is the general standard of moral permissibility.\nThe task of the benevolent is surely to diligently seek to\npromote the benefit of the world and eliminate harm to the world and\nto take this as a model (fa) throughout the world. Does it\nbenefit people? Then do it. Does it not benefit people? Then\nstop. (Book 32, \u201cCondemning Music\u201d)\n\n\nSome passages in the texts go beyond the simple distinction between\nwhat does and does not benefit people to recognize differences in\ndegree. The extent to which an act is right or wrong is determined by\nthe degree to which it benefits or harms others: \u201cThe more one injures\nanother, the greater his unbenevolence, and the more severe the crime\u201d\n(Book 17, \u201cCondemning Aggression\u201d). Typically, however, the moral\nproblems the Mohists discuss concern general practices, such as funeral\ncustoms and warfare, not specific acts. The early texts are vague as to\nhow the standard of benefit (l\u00ec) is to be applied in\nspecific cases that do not fall neatly under one practice or\nanother.\n\n\nUnlike the classical utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill, Mohist\nconsequentialism seeks to promote not individual happiness, but a range\nof goods, many of them public or collective. The general notion of\n\u201cbenefit\u201d refers to an objective list of three sorts of goods: material wealth, a\nlarge population or family, and social order. These goods provide\nrelatively concrete moral criteria. Practices and institutions that\ntend to advance them are benevolent and righteous; those that do not are\nmalicious and wrong.\nMight it be that, supposing we model ourselves on their\nstatements, use their plans, and have rich burials with prolonged\nmourning, this can really enrich the poor, increase the few, secure\nthe endangered, and bring order to the disordered? Then this is\nbenevolent, righteous, and the task of a filial son. In planning for\nothers, it is unacceptable not to encourage it. The benevolent will\npromote it throughout the world, establish it and make the people\npraise it, and never abandon it.\nOn the other hand, suppose that, modeling ourselves on their\nstatements, using their plans, and having rich burials and prolonged\nmourning, this really cannot enrich the poor, increase the few, secure\nthe endangered, and bring order to the disordered. Then this is not\nbenevolent, not righteous, and not the task of a filially devoted\nson. In planning for others, it is unacceptable not to discourage\nit. The benevolent will seek to eliminate it from the world, abandon\nit and make people deem it wrong, and never do it. (Book 25,\n\u201cModeration in Burial\u201d)\n\n\n\nConsequentialist arguments based on one or more of these goods are\nused to justify nine of the ten core Mohist doctrines, including the\nfundamental moral principles of inclusive care and rejecting\naggression. The tenth doctrine, \u201cHeaven\u2019s intent,\u201d elucidates the\njustification for the consequentialist theory itself. (We will consider\nthis doctrine below.)\n\n\nOf the three goods, the Mohists\u2019 concept of \u201corder\u201d (zhi)\ncalls for special attention. This is a complex good comprising a\nvariety of conditions the Mohists probably regard as constitutive of\nthe good social life. From passages in which the Mohists characterize\nzhi (order) and its opposite, luan (disorder,\nturmoil), the elements of \u201corder\u201d seem to include at least four\nsorts of conditions.\n\nAll levels of society conform to unified moral standards, and\nincentives and disincentives based on these standards are administered\nfairly by virtuous leaders, as described in Mohist\n political theory.\nPeace, security, and social harmony prevail, characterized negatively as the\nabsence of crime, deceit, harassment, injury, conflict, and military\naggression.\nMembers of society manifest virtues constitutive of the proper\nperformance of their relational social roles as ruler or subject,\nfather or son, and elder or younger brother. Order obtains only when\nthe ruler is benevolent, his subjects are loyal, fathers are kind, sons\nare filial, and elder and younger brothers display brotherly love and\nrespect. (Like much ancient thought, Mohism has a sexist bias, and with\nfew exceptions the texts disregard the social roles of women.)\nCommunity members habitually engage in reciprocal assistance and\ncharity, sharing information, labor, education, and surplus goods and\naiding the destitute and unfortunate.\n\n\n\nIn summary, \u201cbenefit to the world\u201d is a general conception of\nwelfare comprising social harmony and public security; economic\nprosperity and a thriving population and family; reciprocal cooperation\namong neighbors and charity for the needy; and good social relations,\nmanifested in the exercise of virtues corresponding to the fundamental\nsocial roles.\n\n\nThis list of goods calls for several observations. First, though\nMohist texts frequently state that the duty of the benevolent person is to\npromote benefit for all of society, the characterizations of \u201cbenefit\u201d\nand \u201corder\u201d the texts give suggest that in itself the Mohist ethical\ntheory does not call for selfless altruism. Rather, what is envisioned\namounts to respect for others\u2019 lives, property, families, and political\nsovereignty and reciprocal assistance and cooperation among community\nmembers. Altruistic charity is required only in cases of special\nhardship.\n\n\nSecond, the prominence of virtues associated with fundamental social\nroles indicates that the Mohists, like the Confucians, attach great\nimportance to certain paradigmatic social relationships, probably\nseeing them as forming the basic framework of society. A flourishing\nsociety will be one in which these social roles are performed properly\nand wholeheartedly. Hence the Mohists view flourishing instances of\nthese relationships as partly constitutive of social order\n(zhi) and thus of benefit (l\u00ec). Intriguingly,\nhowever, what the texts identify as goods are not the flourishing\nrelationships themselves, but the role-specific virtues manifested by\nthe persons bound together in them. This is probably because the\nMohists see sincere, proper, fulfilling relationships as constituted by\nthe practice of these role-specific virtues. The virtues are not simply\na means to good relationships; their exercise is part of what it is to\nhave a flourishing relationship of the relevant type. A morally\nadmirable ruler-subject, father-son, or elder-younger brother bond is\njust one in which both parties exercise the relevant virtues \u2014 in\nwhich the ruler manifests benevolence and the subject loyalty, for\nexample. For the Mohists, then, social order is partly constituted by\nthe exercise of these virtues by persons in the relevant social roles.\nAccordingly, since these virtues are among the intrinsic goods of their\nethical theory, the Mohists think it is intrinsically morally admirable\nand right to be a good brother, son, father, subject, or ruler.\n\n\nIf correct, this interpretation has interesting consequences.\nDespite their commitment to the principle of \u201cinclusive care,\u201d or moral\nconcern for all, the Mohists evidently agree with the commonsense view\nthat we have a greater ethical responsibility toward those with whom we\nhave close personal relationships, and in practice we should care for\nthem first. For in order to be a kind father or filial son, for\nexample, we must give our children or parents preferential treatment\nover others. \u201cBenefit to the world\u201d includes good family relationships,\nand such relationships require special loving emotions toward and\ntreatment for family members. Contrary to a common misperception,\nMohist ethics does not advocate that we treat everyone alike, but only\nthat we have similar moral concern for everyone. (We will explore this\npoint further in the next subsection.)\n\n\nFinally, the role of virtues in Mohist ethics suggests that a suitably\nrevised version of their theory might be immune to an important\ncriticism of modern moral theories such as utilitarianism.  The\ncriticism is that in focusing on abstract principles of justification,\nmodern theories have tended to overlook the crucial role of motivation\nin the ethical life. Indeed, a theory that fails to adequately account\nfor moral motivation may be self-defeating. For example, if my motive\nin giving a friend a birthday present is not friendship and affection,\nbut a general desire to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest\nnumber, I may only succeed in disappointing and offending her, and\nthus actually reducing the amount of happiness in the world. To\nsucceed in making others happy, we typically need to be motivated not\nby the greatest happiness principle, but by attitudes such as love,\nconcern, or respect for them as individuals standing in particular\nrelationships to us. To have such attitudes, of course, is just part\nof what it is to be benevolent, loyal, kind, filial, and brotherly. So\nby including these virtues among the goods that provide its\nfundamental ethical justifications, the Mohist theory may have the\nresources to avoid an untenable split between justification and\nmotivation. It is possible that Mohist ethics may help to provide\ninsights \u2014 whether positive or negative remains to be seen\n\u2014 into how to incorporate virtues into an adequate normative\n theory.[14]\nInclusive Care\n\n\nThe ethical guideline for which the Mohists are most well known is\njian ai, sometimes translated as \u201cuniversal love\u201d but probably\nbetter rendered as \u201cinclusive care.\u201d Jian (together, jointly)\nin this context has the connotation of including everyone in society\ntogether within a whole. Like the English \u2018care\u2019,\nai (love, care) is ambiguous, since it may refer to a range of\nattitudes from strong affection to detached concern. In Mohist texts\nthe word typically seems to refer to a dispassionate concern about the\nwelfare of its object.\n\n\nInclusive care was generally not the doctrine that attracted\ncriticism from the Mohists\u2019 contemporaries. Ancient critics objected\nmostly to their frugal, austere lifestyle, opposition to music, and\nplain burial practices, which recognized no differences in social rank.\nLittle was said about their core ethical doctrines. The exception was\nMencius, who is reported to have equated inclusive care with renouncing\none\u2019s father (for this reason, he dismissed Mozi as a \u201cbeast\u201d). Many\nlater Confucian critics have followed Mencius in focusing on inclusive\ncare, maintaining that it runs counter to human nature. The doctrine\ndeserves careful attention, partly to evaluate this criticism and\npartly to draw philosophical lessons from how the Mohists apply the\nnotion of impartiality that stands at the heart of their ethics.\n\n\nIn its complete form, the Mohist doctrine is that people are to\nfollow the fa (standard, model) of \u201cinclusively caring for\neach other, and in interaction benefiting each other.\u201d As the full\nphrase suggests, the Mohists see the psychological attitude of care and\nthe beneficial behavior that results from this attitude as two sides of\na coin. They may hold that the presence of one is a sufficient\ncondition for the other. Yet an important difference between the two is\nindicated by the adverbs in the two parts of the slogan. The attitude\nof care is all-inclusive, encompassing everyone. Beneficial behavior is\nnot all-inclusive, but directed only at those with whom we actually\n interact.[15]\n In practice, then, the slogan does not\ncall for self-sacrificing altruism, but mainly for us to interact with\nothers in a reciprocally beneficial way.\n\n\nThe Mohists offer two sorts of arguments to justify inclusive care.\nOne, which we will treat shortly, is that inclusive care is\n Heaven\u2019s intention.\n The other, applied in all three of the \u201cInclusive Care\u201d texts, is by\nappeal to its good consequences.  Social harm arises from excluding\nother people, families, cities, and states from the scope of moral\nconcern. This exclusion leads to injury, crime, violence, and failure\nto practice the virtues associated with the fundamental social\nrelations. By contrast, were we to practice inclusive care, we would\neliminate these harms and promote \u201cbenefit to the world.\u201d Or so argues\nthe following passage, which interprets inclusive care as the attitude\nof being \u201cfor\u201d \u2014 that is, concerned for the sake of \u2014\nothers\u2019 interests just as we are \u201cfor\u201d our own.\n\nThat being so, then what is the reason that inclusion can replace\nexclusion? He said, \u201cSuppose people were for others\u2019 states as\nfor their state. Then who alone would deploy his state to attack\nothers\u2019 states? One would be for others as for oneself. Were people\nfor others\u2019 cities as for their city, then who alone would deploy his\ncity to assault others\u2019 cities? One would be for others as for\noneself. Were people for others\u2019 clans for their clan, then who alone\nwould deploy his clan to disorder others\u2019 clans? One would be for\nothers as for oneself. That being so, then states and cities not\nattacking and assaulting each other, people and clans not disordering\nand injuring each other, is this harm to the world? Or is it benefit\nto the world? Then we must say, It is benefit to the world.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf we try to fundamentally investigate what these many benefits\nare produced from, what are they produced from? Are they produced from\ndetesting others and injuring others? Then we must say, It\u2019s not\nso. We must say, They are produced from caring about others and\nbenefiting others. If we demarcate and name caring about others and\nbenefiting others in the world, is it \u2018exclusion\u2019? Or is it\n\u2018inclusion\u2019? Then we must say it is \u2018inclusion.\u2019 That being so, then\ndoesn\u2019t this interacting by inclusion turn out to produce great\nbenefit to the world?\u201d Thus our Master Mozi said,\n\u201cInclusion is right (shi).\u201d (Book 16,\n\u201cInclusive Care\u201d)\n\n\n\nThe Mohists contrast inclusive concern with an attitude they call\n\u201cexclusion\u201d (bie, distinguishing or separating off as\n\u201cother\u201d). This attitude is not, as sometimes thought, one of\ndistinguishing differences of degree in our concern for others,\naccording to the closeness of their relation to us. Indeed, the Mohists\nnever seriously consider that\n alternative.[16]\n Rather, bie\nrefers to \u201cdespising and hurting others,\u201d excluding them from moral\nconsideration altogether. So the Mohists\u2019 case is for inclusive care as\nagainst complete disregard for others. We can grant that their\narguments establish that bie, or excluding others from all\nconcern, is morally wrong, and that inclusive care has good\nconsequences and is thus benevolent and permissible. But if their aim is to\nshow that inclusive care is obligatory, then the Mohists are posing a\nfalse dilemma. A different ethical guideline might promote \u201cbenefit to\nthe world\u201d equally or more effectively, without the stringent demand\nthat everyone be as concerned for others\u2019 interests as for their own.\nAlternatively, instead of criticizing the Mohists for trading on a\nfalse dilemma, we could say that their arguments justify inclusive\ncare, but only in the weak sense that we are obliged to be morally\nconcerned for everyone to at least some degree. The question then is,\nto what\n degree?[17]\n\n\nWhen we look to the texts for specifics of what inclusive care\ndemands, the answer is not obvious. What we find is a disparity\nbetween statements describing the attitude of inclusive care and\nconcrete examples of its practice. In theory, inclusive care is\napparently equal concern for all. The passage quoted above, for\nexample, describes it as being concerned \u201cfor others as though\nfor oneself.\u201d Another text tells us that \u201cthe fa\n(model) of inclusively caring for each other and in interaction\nbenefiting each other\u201d is \u201cto regard others\u2019 states as\nthough regarding one\u2019s state, regard others\u2019 families as though\nregarding one\u2019s family, and regard other persons as though regarding\none\u2019s person\u201d (Book 15). Adopting this as a moral fa\n(model, standard) probably involves doing two things: striving toward\nthe ideal of caring about others\u2019 lives, families, and communities to\nexactly the same degree as we care about our own, and in the meantime,\nacting as if we in fact already cared about them equally.\n\n\nIf this interpretation is correct, the doctrine is probably\nuntenable. Most human beings are naturally inclined to feel sympathy\nfor others, including strangers, and thus to care to some degree about\ntheir welfare. But it would take a heroic feat of social engineering to\nget us all to care about strangers exactly as much as we care about\nourselves and those close to us. And even with the proviso that we need\nbenefit only those with whom we actually interact, the standard of\nequal care for others would seem to carry with it impossibly high\npractical demands.\n\n\nOddly, then, the consequences and examples of inclusive care\ndescribed elsewhere in the texts suggest that the practical\nrequirements of the doctrine are not especially burdensome. Indeed, the\nspecific examples given largely conform to what many citizens of\ncontemporary Western liberal democracies would consider commonsense\nmoral decency. The actual practice of inclusive care seems to demand no more\nthan the absence of harm or hostility to others;\nvirtuous performance of our social roles as ruler, subject, father,\nson, or brother, thus contributing to the welfare of our family and\ncommunity; helping friends and neighbors in need; and assisting the\nelderly, solitary, and orphaned, who have no family to care for them.\nSince lacking a family is identified as the main reason people are\nlikely to need assistance, we can infer that the Mohists take the\nfamily to be the primary institution for meeting people\u2019s needs, and\nthat in practice inclusive care normally involves caring chiefly for\nour own family. The only individuals expected to work equally on behalf\nof everyone are government leaders, who are responsible for benefiting\nall of their subjects. So we find a gap between the description of\ninclusive care as the attitude of caring equally for everyone and the\npractical examples in the texts. The latter suggest that inclusive care\ndoes not require extensive self-sacrifice or altruism, but is mainly a\nmatter of looking after our family, neighbors, and community and not\ninterfering with others as they attempt to do the same.\n\n\nThe later Mohist texts provide an explanation of this disparity,\nthough one might dispute whether we are justified in reading the later\ndoctrine into the earlier essays. Fragments preserved in the Da\nQu, Book 44 of the Mozi, maintain that we are to care\nequally for everyone, but to benefit some people more and others less,\ndepending on the nature of their relation to us. Equal care does not\nentail equal treatment. How we treat people is determined by the notion\nof righteousness (yi), which is based on intrinsic goods such as\nsocial order (zhi), the Mohists\u2019 conception of which, as we\nsaw above, entails that we do more for those standing in close\nrelationships to us. The later Mohist view is roughly that attributed\nto a Mohist named Yi Zhi in a dialogue in the Mencius (3A:5):\n\u201cIn care, no degrees; in practice, begin from what is close.\u201d\nPractical Objections\n\n\nAs political and moral reformers, the Mohists were concerned not\nonly to justify the doctrine of inclusive care, but to persuade\neveryone in society to adopt and practice it. This aim induces a number\nof practical problems concerning moral reform and motivation, some of\nwhich are raised in a series of objections discussed in the \u201cInclusive\nCare\u201d texts. The main point of the Mohists\u2019 response to these\nobjections is that inclusive care is consistent with most people\u2019s\nexisting motives and values, so we already have the motivation needed\nto practice it.\n\n\nThe first and most obvious objection is that inclusive care is too\ndifficult. In response, the Mohists claim that in fact it is far less\ndifficult than other deeds rulers have led their people to perform in\nthe past, such as sacrificing their lives, limiting their diets, and\nwearing rough clothing. Inclusive care seems difficult only because\npeople don\u2019t recognize that it is to their long-term benefit. If, as\nMohist political theory proposes, institutions are set up to encourage\ncooperation and prevent abuse, then \u201cwithin a generation\u201d people can be\nled to practice it, because several existing lines of motivation will\nconverge to support it. First, people naturally tend to emulate admired\nand respected leaders, so if rulers encourage inclusive care, people\nwill tend to practice it. Second, rulers can institute rewards and\npunishments so that practicing inclusive care is in everyone\u2019s\nshort-term self-interest. Third, people naturally tend to reciprocate\ngood treatment, so caring for and benefiting others is in our long-term\nself-interest. The Mohists\u2019 case here is reasonably persuasive,\nprovided we keep in mind that they are focusing on the practice of\nreciprocal benefit, not the psychological attitude of equal concern,\nand that the practical demands of inclusive care are not especially\ntaxing.\n\n\nThe second objection is that inclusive care is practically\nimpossible. The reply is that it is possible, because the sage-kings\nactually practiced it. The texts cite purportedly historical examples\nto show that the sage-kings ruled fairly and impartially, performed\npublic works projects that benefited everyone, brought peace to\nsociety, and ensured that the needy were provided for. Again, these\nexamples tend to suggest that the crux of, and perhaps a sufficient\ncondition for, the practice of inclusive care is beneficial actions,\nnot the psychological attitude of equal care for everyone.\n\n\nA third challenge is that inclusive care cannot be \u201cused,\u201d\nreferring most likely to implementing it as a policy people can\nfollow. (Generating benefits when put into use as a social policy\nis the third of the three models the Mohists\npropose to evaluate statements or teachings.) The Mohists present a\npair of hypothetical scenarios intended to show that people committed\nto caring for their own and their family\u2019s welfare would prefer\ninclusive care as a policy to be followed by those around them, since\nwe would all prefer to live under the rule of or entrust the care of\nour family to someone who practices it. That is, acting from an\nexisting motive that nearly all people share\u2014protecting one\u2019s\nown and one\u2019s family\u2019s welfare\u2014people select inclusive care as a\ndao to be followed by those around them, and therefore it\nindeed \u201ccan be used.\u201d The Mohists criticize opponents who\nraise this objection for a practical contradiction: In their\nstatements, they reject inclusive care, but in practice, they would\nselect it as a social dao, just as the people in the\nhypothetical scenarios do. Interestingly, this criticism works only\nbecause the writers assume that the issue at hand is the choice of a\ndao (way), a universal, social system of norms of conduct. They seem to\nassume that all of our choices and actions issue from such norms. Thus they hold that in preferring inclusive care in others, we\ncommit ourselves to it as a code to be observed by all, including\nourselves. To them, the stance of a rational egoist who prefers that\neveryone else, but not he, practice the dao is\nincoherent.\n\n\nThe last objection considered is that inclusive care may fail to\nbenefit one\u2019s parents and thus interfere with filial piety. The\nMohists\u2019 response is that a filial son would desire that others care\nabout and benefit his parents. An effective way to achieve this end,\nthey contend, is by caring for and benefiting others\u2019 parents, leading\nothers to reciprocate in kind. (Here, as in their reply to the first\nobjection, the Mohists make the plausible assumption that humans have a\nnatural tendency toward reciprocity.) Psychologically, then, inclusive\ncare is consistent with our existing motivation to care for our\nparents, while morally it is justified as an indirect means of\nbenefiting them.\n\n\nBecause these arguments are directed at opponents who resist the\nmore optimistic aspects of Mohist moral psychology, they appeal mainly\nto self-interest and the interest of one\u2019s in-group, motives the\nwriters assume are reliably shared by everyone. Other Mohist texts\npresent a fuller picture of moral motivation. Its central premises are\nthat people tend to be strongly committed to doing what they think is\nright, they tend to desire the basic goods that follow from the\npractice of inclusive care, they tend to follow political leadership\nand seek peer approval, and with the exception of miscreants\nresponsible for social disorder, they tend to seek not only their own\nself-interest but the interest of their family and community. Hence\nmost people already possess strong moral motivation and some degree of\nempathy for others. Moreover, because they desire to be good, or\nren (benevolent), they are prepared to accept the force of\nthe better normative reason (gu, also \u201ccause,\u201d\n\u201cbasis\u201d) in discussion.\nBenevolent people inform each other of the patterns by\nwhich they select or reject, deem right or deem wrong. Those who lack\na reason follow those who have a reason. Those who don\u2019t know\nsomething follow those who have knowledge. Lacking remarks to offer in\ntheir defense, they surely submit; seeing good, they surely reform.\n(Book 39, \u201cCondemning Confucianism\u201d)\n\n\nWhat is needed to get most people to act morally, then, is mainly\neducation and normative arguments, which will help them to correctly\nidentify what is right. Such arguments will convince them to guide\ntheir actions by the fa (model) of \u201cregarding others as though\nregarding oneself,\u201d and this fa will in turn strengthen the\nhabit of acting out of sympathy for others\u2019 interests.\nJustification and the Role of Heaven\n\n\nThe Mohists justify their consequentialist ethics by appeal to the\nintention of Heaven (Tian), which they believe provides an\nobjective criterion of morality. Among their reasons for obeying\nHeaven\u2019s intention are gratitude for its gifts, fear of punishment,\nand their belief that it is the noblest, wisest moral agent in the\ncosmos.  Here we will examine this third, philosophically more\ninteresting rationale, setting aside for the moment Heaven\u2019s role as\nan object of\n religious worship\n and enforcer of moral\norder.\n\n\nThe crux of the Mohists\u2019 appeal to Heaven is that as the highest,\nwisest moral agent, Heaven conducts itself in a way (a dao)\nthat unfailingly sets an example of correct ethical norms. Its\nintentions are consistently or reliably benevolent and righteous. To obtain an\nobjective criterion of moral right and wrong, then, we can observe\nHeaven\u2019s conduct and notice the norms it is committed to and\nenforces. Heaven\u2019s intention can serve as a fundamental\nethical fa (model, standard), one that is clear and easy for\nanyone to apply, just as a craftsman\u2019s measuring tools are.\n\n \n\nThus our Master Mozi\u2019s having Heaven\u2019s intention, to give an analogy,\nis no different from the wheelwright\u2019s having a compass or the\ncarpenter\u2019s having a set square.... Above, he uses it to measure how\nthe kings, dukes, and great men of the world administer the penal\ncodes and government; below, he uses it to gauge how the myriad people\nof the world engage in writings and studies and present statements and\ndiscussions. Observe their conduct; if it follows Heaven\u2019s intention,\ncall it good intentions and conduct; if it opposes Heaven\u2019s intention,\ncall it bad intentions and conduct.  Observe their statements and\ndiscussions; if they follow Heaven\u2019s intention, call them good\nstatements and discussions; if they oppose Heaven\u2019s intention, call\nthem bad statements and discussions. Observe their penal codes and\ngovernment; if they follow Heaven\u2019s intention, call them good penal\ncodes and government; if they oppose Heaven\u2019s intention, call them bad\npenal codes and government. So he sets this up as a fa\n(model), establishes this as a standard, and uses it to measure the\nbenevolence (ren) and unbenevolence of the kings, dukes,\ngreat men, secretaries, and ministers in the world, and, to give an\nanalogy, it is like dividing black from white.\n\n\nThus our Master Mozi said, \u201cNow the kings, dukes, great men, officers,\nand gentlemen of the world, if, within, they really desire to follow the\ndao (way), benefit the people, and fundamentally examine the\nroot of benevolence (ren) and righteousness (yi), then\nit\u2019s unacceptable not to follow Heaven\u2019s intention. Following Heaven\u2019s\nintention is the fa (model) of righteousness (yi).\u201d (Book 27,\n\u201cHeaven\u2019s Intent\u201d)\n\n\n\nThough the Mohists themselves do not draw the distinction, we can\nidentify two interrelated roles that Heaven\u2019s intention plays. On the\none hand, it serves as a criterion of what is morally righteous and thus a\nbasis for ethical justification. In the passage above, for example, it\nis used to evaluate whether actions, statements, and practices are\nmorally right. On the other hand, it also serves as a practical moral\nguideline. In practice, we can test particular actions or types of\nconduct against it to determine how to proceed. \u201cHaving taken Heaven as\nfa, we must measure our movements and conduct against Heaven.\nWhat Heaven desires, do it; what Heaven does not desire, stop\u201d (Book 4,\n\u201cModels and Standards\u201d).\n\n\nWhy is Heaven\u2019s intention a reliable ethical standard? The Mohists\ngive a number of moral reasons. As we saw\n earlier,\n they argue that unlike any particular human role model or cultural or\nhistorical standard, Heaven is reliably ren (benevolent), because\nit is impartial, benevolent, and enduring. They further claim that if\nwe examine \u201cthat from which righteousness (yi) issues,\u201d we find\nthat \u201crighteousness issues from Heaven\u201d (Book 27, \u201cHeaven\u2019s\nIntent\u201d). They support this conclusion by running through a quick\ncircle of extensional\nequivalences. Righteousness is good government, because a necessary and\nsufficient condition for social order is that righteousness obtain in the\nworld. In good government, the noble and knowledgeable govern the ignorant and\ncommon. Moral righteousness thus \u201cissues from\u201d the noble and knowledgeable, in\nthat it obtains only in circumstances in which they rule. Heaven is\nthe noblest and most knowledgeable, so righteousness issues from it.\n\n\nTo follow the right dao, then, we can emulate Heaven and\nlearn to conform to the norms it follows. Of course, we are not\ndeities and so cannot imitate Heaven\u2019s actions directly. But we can\nobserve its actions, deduce its desires and intentions, and then\nconform to those.  And what we find is that Heaven desires that people\ncare for and benefit each other (Book 4). It desires that righteousness\n(yi) prevail, and thus desires life, wealth, and social order\nfor people (Book 26). Indeed, it desires all of the goods posited by\nMohist ethical theory, including peace and security, social harmony and\ncooperation, economic sufficiency, and the practice of the virtues\nassociated with the key social roles (Book 27). We know Heaven desires\nthese things because its actions show that it cares for and benefits\neveryone without discrimination. It is benevolent, providing all\npeople with life, sustenance, and natural resources. It enforces\nmorality by avenging crimes against the innocent. It rewarded the six\nancient sage-kings, who cared for and benefited the people, and\npunished the four tyrants, who despised and hurt the people. It\npossesses all the people of the world as a ruler possesses his\nsubjects, and thus it cares about everyone, just as a ruler cares\nabout his subjects.\n In short, Heaven itself desires the goods the Mohist ethical\ntheory adopts as criteria of what is morally right. That theory is\nthus correct, the Mohists think, because it captures the ethical norms\nfollowed by Heaven, the wise, impartial, and benevolent agent at the\napex of the cosmic political hierarchy, to whom all people should\n\u201cidentifying upward\u201d.\n\n\nThis appeal to a conjunction religious beliefs about Heaven and the political\ndoctrine of \u201cidentifying upward\u201d has led some scholars to suggest that\nMohist ethics might ultimately be a form of divine command theory.\nDrawing mainly on the claim that Heaven is \u201cthat from which righteousness\nissues,\u201d for instance, Soles (1999) contends that for the Mohists,\n\u201cWhat makes Heaven\u2019s commands right is the mere fact that Heaven\ncommands them\u201d (p. 46). Without question, a few passages in the texts\nurge people to conform to moral norms specifically because doing so is\nHeaven\u2019s intention, and the doctrine that obedience to Heaven brings\nreward and disobedience punishment is redolent of a divine command theory.\nMoreover, these religious beliefs are crucial to the Mohist worldview,\nand an inaccurate, distorted picture of their thought results if we\nneglect them.\n\n\nStill, there are strong grounds for denying that the Mohists hold a\ndivine command theory. First, the texts never analyze, define, or\nexplain the notion of righteousness (yi) in terms of Heaven\u2019s\nintention. To the contrary, all four of the texts about Heaven\u2019s\nintention assign it an epistemic role, as a test or criterion by which\nto distinguish right from wrong. They argue that Heaven\u2019s intention\ncan be taken as a model (fa) or canon (jing) of\nrighteousness (yi). This claim asserts an extensional\nequivalence, not an analysis, definition, or exposition. The point is\nthat Heaven\u2019s intention and \u2018righteousness\u2019 distinguish\nthe same things, not that what is righteous is so because it is\nHeaven\u2019s intention. Even the claim that righteousness \u201cissues\nfrom\u201d Heaven need not be read as implying anything stronger than\nthat a righteous society can exist only when people all follow the\nmodel or example set by Heaven\u2019s intentions and conduct.\n\n\nSecond, and more important, the Mohists give independent moral reasons\nto support their claim that Heaven\u2019s intention is a reliable moral\nguide. Their grounds are not simply the religious belief that Heaven\nmust be obeyed because it is a deity or because it punishes\ndisobedience. Rather, they argue that Heaven is a guide to what is\nbenevolent and righteous because it is a supremely noble, wise,\nimpartial, benevolent, and reliable agent. Their reasons apply\nevaluative concepts of benevolence, righteousness, good government,\nand social order (zhi) that are independent of Heaven\u2019s\nintention. To support their contention that Heaven desires what is\nrighteous (yi), for example, they characterize righteousness\nas comprising life, wealth, and order and claim that Heaven desires\nthese. Phrased in terms of the Euthyphro dilemma, their\nstance is fairly clear: What is righteous is not righteous\nbecause Heaven intends it.  Rather, Heaven intends it because\nit is righteous. Heaven\u2019s conduct and intentions exemplify moral norms\nthat hold independently of its intent.\n\n\nGiven how the Mohists\u2019 conception of Heaven fits into the framework of\ntheir ethics, the appeal to Heaven to justify and explicate their\nnormative stance risks circularity. Their conception of Heaven is in\neffect that of a morally ideal sovereign, whom they characterize as\nwise or all-knowing, all-embracing, benevolent, generous, and\nimpartial. The Mohists imply that the correct moral norms are those\nthat such an agent would follow or intend that human beings\nfollow. The problem is that the characteristics they build into this\nconception of an ideal agent are just those they already hold should\nbe articulated by a satisfactory ethical theory, such as impartial,\nbenevolent concern for the welfare of all. Arguably, then, the appeal\nto Heaven does not justify Mohist ethics so much as simply illustrate\nor articulate it.  \n\n\nA potential problem with the appeal to Heaven arises from the way the\nMohists\u2019 concept of a fa (model) runs together the notions of\na criterion of righteousness, a practical guideline, and a role\nmodel. The idea of objectively justifying our practices and standards\nof conduct by appeal to the abstract, decontextualized stance of an\nideally impartial and benevolent agent is at least prima\nfacie plausible. But the Mohist theory risks confusing this with\nthe much less plausible idea that in practice we should guide our\nconduct by emulating a benevolent deity who cares impartially for\nall. In effect, they conflate the idea of seeking an impartial\njustification for our actions, which are taken from within a\nparticular, and thus necessarily partial, context, with that of\nadopting an impartial point of view, but one that, impossibly, is\nabstracted from any particular context. In some contexts, Mohist\narguments are careful to avoid conflating these points, but in others\nthey verge on identifying the attitudes of the benevolent person with\nthose of Heaven itself. \nCritical Assessment\n\n\nThe basic structure of the Mohist ethical theory is simple yet\nprofound. At its base stands the notion of impartial concern for the\nbenefit of all, as epitomized by the point of view of Heaven, an\nideally benevolent, impartial agent who cares equally about everyone\u2019s\nwelfare. From this foundation, the Mohists develop a consequentialist\naccount of the benevolent (ren) and the righteous (yi) in\nterms of a set of goods that constitute benefit or welfare. Community\npractices are justified by their instrumental value in promoting the\nwelfare of all. The theory recognizes that individuals exist within a\nweb of social relations, which partly define their identities and\nduties, and that strong social relationships are a crucial part of\nhuman welfare. It assigns virtues a role in guiding action and in\nconstituting good social relations. The theory is loosely formulated,\ninelegantly expressed, and supported by arguments that to modern\nreaders may in places seem rudimentary or simplistic. Still, coming at\nthe beginning of the philosophical discourse of ancient China, it\nrepresents a quantum leap in theory construction and argumentation in\ncomparison to earlier Confucian discourse. Moreover, the general type\nof consequentialist approach it lays out remains a well-regarded\noption in ethical theory today.\n\n\nThe strong point of the Mohist theory is that it grounds moral\nrighteousness (yi) on two key notions, impartiality and human\nwelfare. Yet the major defects of Mohist ethical thought lie precisely\nin how these ideas are handled. The locus of impartiality is\nmisplaced, and the conception of human welfare is too narrow. \n\n\nThe problem with the Mohists\u2019 treatment of impartiality is that they\nlocate it in the attitude of moral concern, instead of in the\njustification for our actions or practices. Their approach to finding\nobjective, impartial ethical norms is to advocate that each individual\nbe impartially motivated by equal concern for all. We are to conform\nto the standard of \u201cregarding others as though regarding oneself\u201d or\nto model ourselves on the God\u2019s-eye stance of Heaven. But in practice\nwe cannot possibly act for all others as though acting for ourselves,\nand unlike Heaven, we are rarely in a position to act on behalf of\neveryone. So the Mohists fail to articulate a conception of impartiality that\nis viable in practice. Impartial, equal concern cannot defensibly be\nadvocated as the ideal ethical motivation of individual agents.\n\n\nOne plausible response to this problem would be to develop a form of\nrule or practice consequentialism. The Mohists could apply their basic\nstandard of righteousness \u2014 what \u201cpromotes benefit to and eliminates harm from\nthe world\u201d \u2014 as a criterion by which to justify a social dao\n(way), or set of practices and norms, that best promotes everyone\u2019s\nwelfare. These impartially justified practices and norms could then\nguide action in particular situations. In practice, of course, the\nMohists adopt roughly just this approach. They advocate equal care for all,\nbut allow that how we actually treat others will vary depending on our\nrelation to them. According to the later Mohist texts, where this\ndoctrine of equal care but different treatment is presented explicitly,\nour treatment of others will be guided by standards of yi\n(righteousness), which probably articulate practices the Mohists think\nbest promote the welfare of everyone in society.\n\n\nThe hitch is that such a practice-consequentialist approach is\nunlikely to support the Mohist doctrine of equal care for all.\nPresumably, in line with the compelling points in the Mohists\u2019\narguments, the norms and practices justified by this approach would\nlead individuals to adopt the attitude of inclusive care, and\nso to include everyone within the scope of their moral concern. But the\nconsequentialist standard of promoting everyone\u2019s welfare probably\nwould not demand that each of us realize the attitude of equal\ncare, or equal and impartial concern for everyone. Rather, both\ntreatment and care would probably be allowed to vary with relationship\nand context, provided that a basic minimum standard of concern \u2014\nperhaps only non-interference, basic courtesy, and help in emergencies\n\u2014 were met for strangers to whom we have no special relation.\n\n\nTo this, the Mohists might respond that we should still practice\nequal care, because it is the way of the sage-kings and the intention\nof Heaven, the highest moral exemplar, and its practice produces great\nbenefit for the world. The Mohists recognize no distinction between\nobligation and supererogation, and perhaps their religious beliefs\nconvince them that the best life is one that most fully complies with\nHeaven\u2019s desire that we care for and benefit others. Also, as the\nZhuangzi passage\n quoted earlier\n attests,\nmany Mohists particularly revered and emulated Yu, the most\nself-sacrificing and altruistic of the sage-kings.\n\n\nBut it is probably false that the general practice of equal care\nwould yield the most benefit for the world. Setting aside emergencies\nand the special duties of highly demanding jobs such as sage-king, it is likely that the\nMohists\u2019 own basic goods are best promoted not only by treating those\nclosest to us differently from others, but by caring about them more,\ntoo. The idea of disconnecting care from treatment is counterintuitive.\nIn particular, it seems unlikely that we could genuinely exercise the\nvirtues associated with the key social relations without also caring\nmore about the people to whom we are related. It is hard to envision\nsomeone really being a loyal minister or kind father without also\ncaring more about his ruler or children than a stranger\u2019s. Moreover,\ntremendous practical problems would be involved in training everyone to\ncare equally for all, requiring a vast expenditure of effort and wealth\non ends that could be achieved just as well by the practice of\ninclusive, but unequal care.\n\n\nThe second major defect of Mohist ethical thought is its excessively\nnarrow, material conception of human welfare or benefit\n(l\u00ec), which comprises little more than material\nwell-being and peaceful, harmonious social relations. With a handful\nof exceptions, Mohist ethics dismisses aesthetic value and overlooks\nthe psychophysical fulfillment achieved through the exercise of\nacquired skills\u2014goods that are central to the Confucian and\nDaoist ways of life. Little attention is devoted to individual\nhappiness or fulfillment or to articulating a conception of\nwell-rounded human excellence. Moreover, the Mohist conception of\nmorality can at times seem aggressively one-sided and burdensome. One\npassage in the Mozi presents a conception of ideal human\nflourishing as a life of complete devotion to moral duty:\nWhen silent, ponder; when speaking, instruct; when acting,\nwork. Make these three alternate and surely you will be a sage. You\nmust eliminate happiness and eliminate anger, eliminate joy and\neliminate sorrow, eliminate fondness and eliminate dislike, and use\nbenevolence and righteousness. Your hands, feet, mouth, nose, and ears\nundertaking righteousness, surely you will be a sage. (Book 47,\n\u201cValuing Righteousness\u201d)\n\n\nTheir thin conception of human welfare may be one reason some\nMohists saw a life of altruistic self-sacrifice as the way of the\nsages. If satisfying basic material needs is sufficient to secure our\nwelfare, then once those needs are met, we have little\nworthwhile to do but help others.\n\n\nTo be fair, however, the Mohists\u2019 minimalist conception of welfare may\nhave been a reasonable response to the difficult social and economic\ncircumstances in which they lived, particularly as representatives of\nsub-elite social classes. Their texts imply an environment in which\nhardship due to poverty, poor harvests, cold, hunger, or war is never\nfar off. So naturally they focus on the basic goods needed for\nphysical and economic security: a stable government, material wealth,\nstrong family bonds, and charity to neighbors in need. Mohism is in\neffect a refugee ethic, born from hard times, that values material\nwelfare and parsimony above all else. Their doctrine of \u201cModeration in\nUse\u201d advocates eliminating all luxuries\u2014particularly\nthose of the aristocracy\u2014and reducing consumption of food,\nclothing, and housing to the minimum level needed for basic\ncomfort. If conditions are really as harsh as the Mohists imply\n\u2014 a premise that Xunzi, a friend of the aristocracy, will deny\n\u2014 then their narrow focus is defensible, and in arguing that\nelaborate musical shows and burial practices are wasteful and immoral,\nfor instance, they are on firm ground. The problem is that the Mohists\nnever reflect on the possibility that in more prosperous and\negalitarian conditions, music and other cultural activities could be\nvaluable contributions to human well-being.\n\n\nIf Mohist ethics faces a problem of moral motivation, it is probably\nbecause their impoverished conception of human welfare excludes too\nmuch that people genuinely value. When the Zhuangzi criticizes\nthe Mohists for \u201cgoing against the heart of all under heaven,\u201d it is\nnot referring to inclusive care, but to their severe, frugal lifestyle.\nAs Xunzi said, \u201cMozi was blinkered by utility and did not recognize adornment\u201d\n(Xunzi, Book 21, \u201cDispelling Blindness\u201d).\n",
