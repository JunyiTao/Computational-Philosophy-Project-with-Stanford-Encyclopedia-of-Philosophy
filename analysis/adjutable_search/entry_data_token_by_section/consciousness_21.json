    "main_text": "The functional question: Why does consciousness exist? || Causal status of consciousness\n6.1 Causal status of consciousness\n\n\nPerhaps the most basic issue posed by any version of the Why\nquestion is whether or not consciousness of the relevant sort has any\ncausal impact at all. If it has no effects and makes no causal\ndifference whatsoever, then it would seem unable to play any\nsignificant role in the systems or organisms in which it is present,\nthus undercutting at the outset most inquiries about its possible\nvalue. Nor can the threat of epiphenomenal irrelevance be simply\ndismissed as an obvious non-option, since at least some forms of\nconsciousness have been seriously alleged in the recent literature to\nlack causal status. (See the entry on\n epiphenomenalism.)\n Such worries have been raised especially with regard to qualia and\nqualitative consciousness (Huxley 1874, Jackson 1982, Chalmers 1996),\nbut challenges have also been leveled against the causal status of\nother sorts including meta-mental consciousness (Velmans 1991).\n\n\nBoth metaphysical and empirical arguments have been given in support\nof such claims. Among the former are those that appeal to intuitions\nabout the conceivability and logical possibility of zombies, i.e., of\nbeings whose behavior, functional organization, and physical structure\ndown to the molecular level are identical to those of normal human\nagents but who lack any qualia or qualitative consciousness. Some (Kirk\n1970, Chalmers 1996) assert such beings are possible in worlds that\nshare all our physical laws, but others deny it (Dennett 1991, Levine\n2001). If they are possible in such worlds, then it would seem to\nfollow that even in our world, qualia do not affect the course of\nphysical events including those that constitute our human behaviors. If\nthose events unfold in the same way whether or not qualia are present,\nthen qualia appear to be inert or epiphenomenal at least with respect\nto events in the physical world. However, such arguments and the zombie\nintuitions on which they rely are controversial and their soundness\nremains in dispute (Searle 1992, Yablo 1998, Balog 1999).\n\n\nArguments of a far more empirical sort have challenged the causal\nstatus of meta-mental consciousness, at least in so far as its presence\ncan be measured by the ability to report on one's mental state.\nScientific evidence is claimed to show that consciousness of that sort\nis neither necessary for any type of mental ability nor does it occur\nearly enough to act as a cause of the acts or processes typically\nthought to be its effects (Velmans 1991). According to those who make\nsuch arguments, the sorts of mental abilities that are typically\nthought to require consciousness can all be realized unconsciously in\nthe absence of the supposedly required self-awareness.\n\n\nMoreover, even when conscious self-awareness is present, it\nallegedly occurs too late to be the cause of the relevant actions\nrather than their result or at best a joint effect of some shared prior\ncause (Libet 1985). Self-awareness or meta-mental consciousness\naccording to these arguments turns out to be a psychological\nafter-effect rather than an initiating cause, more like a post\nfacto printout or the result displayed on one's computer screen\nthan like the actual processor operations that produce both the\ncomputer's response and its display.\n\n\nOnce again the arguments are controversial, and both the supposed\ndata and their interpretation are subjects of lively disagreement (see\nFlanagan 1992, and commentaries accompanying Velmans 1991). Though the\nempirical arguments, like the zombie claims, require one to consider\nseriously whether some forms of consciousness may be less causally\npotent than is typically assumed, many theorists regard the empirical\ndata as no real threat to the causal status of consciousness.\n\n\nIf the epiphenomenalists are wrong and consciousness, in its various\nforms, is indeed causal, what sorts of effects does it have and what\ndifferences does it make? How do mental processes that involve the\nrelevant sort of consciousness differ form those that lack it? What\nfunction(s) might consciousness play? The following six sections\n(6.2\u20136.7) discuss some of the more commonly given\nanswers. Though the various functions overlap to some degree, each is\ndistinct, and they differ as well in the sorts of consciousness with\nwhich each is most aptly linked.\n",
