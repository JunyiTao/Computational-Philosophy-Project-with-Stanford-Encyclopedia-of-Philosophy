    "main_text": "Feigl and the Vienna Circle\n2. Feigl and the Vienna Circle\n\nAs already indicated, Feigl was a member of the Vienna Circle from its\nvery beginning. Together with Friedrich Waismann he had suggested to\nSchlick the formation of an evening discussion group (see Feigl 1981,\np. 60). Schlick took over the idea and installed a Thursday evening\ncolloquium in the Vienna Boltzmanngasse 5, the location of the\nUniversity\u2019s Department of Mathematics. Among the co-founders of\nthe Circle were, besides Waismann and Feigl himself, Hans Hahn, Otto\nNeurath, Olga Hahn-Neurath, Viktor Kraft, Felix Kaufmann, and the\nmathematician Kurt Reidemeister. It was the latter who proposed the\nreading and discussion of Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus\nlogico-philosophicus. As Feigl reported in an unpublished\ninterview,\n\n[t]he approximate date of the beginning of the [Vienna Circle] was\n1924, but I do not remember whether it was in the spring or in the\nfall of that year. It was professor Kurt Reidemeister, the\nmathematician, who proposed the first reading of the Tractatus, and\nwho (together with Hahn, Schlick and Neurath) was most active in that\nfirst exegesis. I myself had read the first publication of the\nTractatus in Ostwald\u2019s Annalen der Naturphilosophie (1922, I\nbelieve), but at that time I was a very young student and I dismissed\nWittgenstein as a most curios mixture of intuitive genius and\nschizophrenia. (Quoted from Stadler 1997, p. 233)\n\n\nHowever, the reading of Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus was\nonly one of a number of topics discussed within the Circle. According\nto Feigl, \u201cabout 60 % of our time was devoted to the problems of\nthe foundation of mathematics and the rest to philosophy of science\nand epistemology\u201d (ibid.). Between 1926 and 1928 it was the\nreading of (the typescript of) Rudolf Carnap\u2019s Der logische\nAufbau der Welt which dominated the discussion.\n\nAs for Feigl\u2019s own development, his doctoral dissertation under\nSchlick\u2019s supervision should be mentioned first. Submitted in\nJuly1927, the purpose of this study was to examine the problem of the\napplication of the probability calculus, hence its title \u201cChance\nand law: an epistemological analysis of the roles of probability and\ninduction in the natural sciences.\u201d Heavily inspired by Edgar\nZilsel\u2019s Das Anwendungsproblem (1916), Feigl argued\nalong pragmatic (Humean) lines. His central thesis was that the\nproblem of induction cannot be solved by making recourse to the\nprobability concept. Feigl, thereby criticizing especially the point\nof view defended by Hans Reichenbach, proposed instead a\n\u2018vindication\u2019 rather than a \u2018validation\u2019 of\ninductive reasoning. Relying on a frequency interpretation of\nprobability, he argued that the limiting value of an infinite sequence\ncan only be inferred inductively, which in turn implied that\nprobability is dependent on induction and not vice versa.\nConcerning the principle of induction itself, Feigl (like his teacher\nSchlick) saw no other possibility than to interpret it as a pragmatic\n(or operational) maxim. On the whole, however, the approach laid down\nin Feigl\u2019s dissertation was, as Feigl himself later conceded\n(see Feigl 1981, p. 6), severely limited by its neglect of the\nsimultaneous rise and development of quantum mechanics.\n\nIt was in the 1929 book Theorie und Erfahrung in der Physik\nthat Feigl reflected on the philosophical significance of quantum\nmechanics. In addition he elaborated on the more general issues of\nscientific explanation and the hypothetico-deductive method in theory\nconstruction, thereby informally anticipating ideas later developed in\nmore detail by Karl Popper and especially by Carl Gustav Hempel. On\nthe programmatic level, Feigl criticized both Kantianism and\nconventionalism and argued, positively, for a \u2018critical\nrealist\u2019 approach to the relationship of theory and experience\nin physics. The book, which received favorable reactions by practicing\nphysicists such as Albert Einstein and Wolfgang Pauli, was\nFeigl\u2019s only book in German language. Its exposed position with\nrespect to programmatic outlook Feigl retrospectively described as\nfollows:\n\nAlthough I had been in the \u2018loyal opposition\u2019 in regard to\nthe positivism of the Vienna Circle, I had a hard time maintaining\nagainst them the sort of critical realism that I had originally\nlearned to adopt from Schlick\u2019s own early work [\u2026]. Under\nthe influence of Carnap and the early Wittgenstein, Schlick and\nWaismann were converted to a sort of phenomenalistic positivism during\nthe middle twenties. Their brilliant and powerful arguments\noverwhelmed me temporarily. But encouraged and buttressed by the\nsupport of Popper, Reichenbach, and Zilsel, I regained confidence in\nmy earlier realism and developed it in my first book on Theorie\nund Erfahrung in der Physik [\u2026]. (Feigl 1981, pp.\n9\u201310)\n\n\nThat Schlick was converted to \u201cphenomenalistic positivism\u201d\nmight be contested (see Geymonat 1985); but, beyond the shadow of a\ndoubt, Feigl\u2019s realistic reconstruction of the theories of\nphysics had a minority status within the Vienna Circle. After his\nemigration to the United States, Feigl devoted much of his work to\ndeveloping a stable realist stance.\n",
