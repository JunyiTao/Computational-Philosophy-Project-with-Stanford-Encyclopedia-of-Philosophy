Clarity\nand distinctness of intellectual perception is the mark of truth.\n\nIn the fifth set of Objections to the Meditations, Gassendi\nsuggests that there is difficulty concerning\n\nwhat possible skill or method will permit us to discover that our\nunderstanding is so clear and distinct as to be true and to make it\nimpossible that we should be mistaken. As I objected at the beginning,\nwe are often deceived even though we think we know something as\nclearly and distinctly as anything can possibly be known. (7:318)\n\n\nGassendi has in effect asked how it is that we should recognize clear\nand distinct perceptions. If clarity and distinctness is the mark of\ntruth, what is the method for recognizing clarity and\ndistinctness?\n\nIn reply, Descartes claims that he has already supplied such a method\n(7:379). What could he have in mind? It cannot be the simple belief\nthat one has attained clarity and distinctness, for Descartes\nacknowledges that individuals can be wrong in that belief (7:35, 361).\nHe offers this criterion: we have a clear and distinct perception of\nsomething if, when we consider it, we cannot doubt it (7:145). That\nis, in the face of genuine clear and distinct perception, our\naffirmation of it is so firm that it cannot be shaken, even by a\nconcerted effort to call the things thus affirmed into doubt.\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.1, Descartes held that any act of judgment,\nsuch as the affirmation \u201cI think, therefore I am,\u201d\ninvolves both the intellect and will. The intellect perceives or\nrepresents the content of the judgment; the will affirms or denies\nthat content. In the face of genuine clarity and distinctness,\n\u201ca great light in the intellect\u201d is followed by \u201ca\ngreat inclination of the will\u201d (7:59). The inclination of the\nwill is so strong that it amounts to compulsion; we cannot help but so\naffirm. Descartes maintains that unshakable conviction provides the\ncriterion of genuinely clear and distinct perception. Can\u2019t\nsomeone be unshakable in their conviction merely because they are\nstubborn? Assuredly. But Descartes is talking about a conviction that\nremains unshakable in face of serious and well-thought out challenges\n(7:22). To be immune from doubt does not mean simply that you do not\ndoubt a proposition, or even that it resists a momentary attempt to\ndoubt; the real criterion for truth is that the content of a\nproposition is so clearly perceived that the will is drawn to it in\nsuch a way that the will\u2019s affirmation cannot be shaken even by\nthe systematic and sustained doubts of the Meditations.\nPerhaps because the process for achieving knowledge of fundamental\ntruths requires sustained, systematic doubt, Descartes indicates that\nsuch doubt should be undertaken only once in the course of a life\n(7:18; 3:695).\n\nEven so, problems remain. Having extracted clarity and distinctness as\nthe criterion of truth at the beginning of the Third Meditation,\nDescartes immediately calls it into question. He re-introduces an\nelement of the radical doubt from the First Meditation: that a\npowerful God might have created him with \u201ca nature such that I\nwas deceived even in matters which seemed most evident\u201d (7:36).\nDescartes therefore launches an investigation of \u201cwhether there\nis a God, and, if there is, whether he can be a deceiver\u201d\n(7:36).\n\nIn the course of the Third Meditation, Descartes constructs an\nargument for the existence of God that starts from the idea of an\ninfinite being. The argument is intricate. It invokes the metaphysical\nprinciple that \u201cthere must be at least as much reality in the\nefficient and total cause as in the effect of that cause\u201d\n(7:40). This principle is put forward as something that is\n\u201cmanifest by the natural light\u201d (7:40), which itself is\ndescribed as a cognitive power whose results are indubitable (7:38),\nlike clear and distinct perception (7:144). Descartes then applies\nthat principle not to the mere existence of the idea of God as a state\nof mind, but to the content of that idea. Descartes characterizes that\ncontent as infinite, and he then argues that a content that represents\ninfinity requires an infinite being as its cause. He concludes,\ntherefore, that an infinite being, or God, must exist. He then equates\nan infinite being with a perfect being and asks whether a perfect\nbeing could be a deceiver. He concludes: \u201cIt is clear enough\nfrom this that he cannot be a deceiver, since it is manifest by the\nnatural light that all fraud and deception depend on some\ndefect\u201d (7:52). (If you are concerned by the move from infinity\nto perfection, consider that in Descartes\u2019 philosophical\nlandscape perfect meant complete, and infinitude is the highest degree\nof completeness.)\n\nThe second and fourth sets of objections drew attention to a\nproblematic characteristic of this argument. In the words of\nArnauld:\n\nI have one further worry, namely how the author avoids reasoning in a\ncircle when he says that we are sure that what we clearly and\ndistinctly perceive is true only because God exists. But we can be\nsure that God exists only because we clearly and distinctly perceive\nthis. Hence, before we can be sure that God exists, we ought to be\nable to be sure that whatever we perceive clearly and evidently is\ntrue. (7:214).\n\n\nArnauld here raises the well-known problem of the Cartesian circle,\nmuch discussed in recent years.\n\nIn reply to Arnauld, Descartes claims that he avoided this problem by\ndistinguishing between present clear and distinct perceptions and\nthose that are merely remembered (7:246). He is not here challenging\nthe reliability of memory (Frankfurt 1962). Rather, his strategy is to\nsuggest that the hypothesis of a deceiving God can only present itself\nwhen we are not clearly and distinctly perceiving the infinity and\nperfection of God, because when we are doing that we cannot help but\nbelieve that God is no deceiver. It is as if this very evident\nperception is to be balanced against the uncertain opinion that God\nmight be a deceiver (7:144). The evident perception wins out and the\ndoubt is removed.\n\nScholars have debated whether the above response is adequate. Some\nhave constructed other responses on Descartes\u2019 behalf or have\nfound them embedded in his writings. One type of response appeals to a\ndistinction between the natural light and clear and distinct\nperception, and seeks to vindicate the natural light without appeal to\nGod (Jacquette 1996). Another response suggests that, in the end,\nDescartes was not aiming at metaphysical certainty concerning a\nmind-independent world but was merely seeking an internally coherent\nset of beliefs (Frankfurt 1965). A related response suggests that\nDescartes was after mere psychological certainty (Loeb 1992). The\ninterested reader can follow up this question by turning to the\nliterature just cited (as also to Carriero 2008, Doney 1987, Hatfield\n2006, and Newman 2019).\n\nBuilding on his claim that clear and distinct perceptions are true,\nDescartes seeks to establish various results concerning the nature of\nreality, including the existence of a perfect God as well as the\nnatures of mind and matter (discussed more fully in Sec. 3.3). Here we\nmust ask: What is the human mind that it can perceive the nature of\nreality? Descartes has a specific answer to this question: the human\nmind comes supplied with innate ideas that allow it to perceive the\nmain properties of God (infinity and perfection), the essence of\nmatter, and the essence of mind. For readers in Descartes\u2019 day,\nthis claim would naturally raise a further question: assuming that\nthese innate ideas concern \u201ceternal truths\u201d about God,\nmatter, and mind, do these truths hold independently of God, or do\nthey instead derive from the original contents of God\u2019s own\nintellect?\n\nDescartes rejected both alternatives. He denied, along with many of\nhis contemporaries, that there are eternal truths independent of the\nexistence of God. But he departed from many of his contemporaries in\nalso denying that the eternal truths are fixed in God\u2019s\nintellect. Some Neoplatonist philosophers held that the eternal truths\nin the human mind are copies, or ectypes, of the archetypes in the\nmind of God. Some Aristotelian philosophers just prior to Descartes,\nincluding Francisco Su\u00e1rez (1548\u20131617), held that the\neternal truths reflect God\u2019s own understanding of his creative\npower; God\u2019s power includes that, if he creates a rabbit, it\nmust be an animal. Eternal truths are latent in God\u2019s creative\npower, and he understands this, so that if human beings understand the\neternal truths as eternal, they do so by understanding the creative\npower of God, which may be something beyond human capacity (Hatfield\n1993).\n\nDescartes had a different account. He held that the eternal truths are\nthe free creations of God (Corr. 1:145, 149, 151;\nMed. 7:380, 432), originating from him in a way that does not\ndistinguish among his power, will, and intellect. God decides what the\nessence of a circle is, or to make 2 + 3 = 5. He might have created\nother essences, but we can\u2019t conceive what they might have been.\nOur conceptual capacity is limited to the innate ideas that God has\nimplanted in us, and these reflect the actual truths that he created.\nGod creates the eternal truths (concerning logic, mathematics, the\nnature of the good, the essences of mind and matter), and he creates\nthe human mind and provisions it with innate ideas that correspond to\nthose truths. Even in this scheme there must be some eternal truths\nnot created by God: those that pertain to the essence of God himself,\nincluding his existence and perfection (see Wells 1982).\n",
