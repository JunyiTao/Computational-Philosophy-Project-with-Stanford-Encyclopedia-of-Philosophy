As a Master of Arts he is one of the\nfirst to comment on the newly available Aristotelian logical works,\ncommentaries whose influence is generally recognized. His is also a\nwidely read introduction to the sciences, the De ortu\nscientiarum. He is however mostly associated with Augustinian\nthought, especially on the plurality of substantial forms and the\nactive nature of perception, and through his involvement in the\ncontroversy surrounding the Prohibitions in 1277 of thirty articles on\nlogic, grammar, and natural philosophy. He was promoted to Cardinal\nand died soon after arriving at the Papal Court of Viterbo, in\n1279.\n",
