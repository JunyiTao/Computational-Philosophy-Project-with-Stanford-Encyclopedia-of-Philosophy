    "main_text": "The Dynamical Approach || The Dynamical Approach and General Relativity\n4.3 The Dynamical Approach and General Relativity\n\nAs we have already seen in section 2, spacetime in GTR is dynamical.\nThis leads Brown to maintain that there is no substantial conceptual\ndistinction between the metric field of GTR and matter fields:\n\u201cGravity is different from the other interactions, but this\ndoesn\u2019t mean that it is categorically distinct from,\nsay, the electromagnetic field\u201d (Brown 2005, p. 159). In this\nsense, Brown is a relationist about GTR, and counts authors such as\n(Rovelli, 1997) as allies. However, much caution is needed concerning\nthis use of the term \u2018relationism\u2019. In particular, in the\ncontext of GTR \u2013 and in significant contrast with his approach\nto theories such as STR \u2013 Brown makes no claim that the metric\nfield should be ontologically reduced to properties of (the laws\ngoverning) matter fields; rather, in light of its dynamical status,\nthe metric field of GTR \u201ccries out for reification\u201d\n(Brown, personal communication). Indeed, even if Brown did not\nmaintain this, we have already registered above that there are\ntechnical problems with attempting to apply the dynamical approach,\nunderstood as a version of regularity relationism, to theories such as\nGTR.\n\nIn light of these issues, when considering GTR, Brown (2005, ch. 9)\nfocuses entirely on thesis (2), presented in the introduction to this\nsection: no piece of geometrical structure has its\n\u2018chronogeometric significance\u2019 of necessity \u2013 that\nis, no piece of geometrical structure is necessarily surveyed by\nphysical bodies; rather, in order to ascertain whether such is the\ncase, one must pay detailed attention to the dynamics of the matter\nfields constituting those physical bodies. This, indeed, should\nalready be evident in light of the examples discussed in the previous\nsubsection, such as the Jacobson-Mattingly theory, in which matter\ndoes not \u2018advert\u2019 to the designated piece of spacetime\nstructure.\n\nThis thesis (2) should be uncontroversial. There are, however,\nconcerns that the thesis is so uncontroversial that any\ndistinction between the dynamical approach and its opponents in the\ncontext of theories such as GTR (and, in particular, without the\nregularity relationist approach to ontological reduction applied in\nthe case of theories with fixed spacetime structure) has been effaced\n(Pooley 2013; Read 2020a). Even setting this aside, there are also\ndisagreements regarding how exactly a piece of structure in a given\ntheory is to acquire its \u2018chronogeometric\nsignificance\u2019 \u2013 that is, for the intervals which it\ndetermines to be accessible operationally to physical bodies and\nmeasuring devices. Brown\u2019s preferred answer to this question\n(Brown 2005, ch. 9) makes appeal to the \u2018strong equivalence\nprinciple\u2019. There are a great many subtleties and technical\ndifficulties which need to be overcome in order to attain a clear\nunderstanding of this principle (Read, Brown & Lehmkuhl 2018;\nWeatherall 2020), but, roughly speaking, it states that, in local\nregions in GTR, matter fields can be understood to obey Lorentz\ncovariant dynamical equations, just as in STR (we have already seen\nsomething of this in section 2 above). Absent further details,\npace Brown, it is not clear why this is sufficient to secure\nthe \u2018chronogeometric significance\u2019 of the metric field in\nGTR. Even setting this aside, there are questions regarding whether\nthe strong equivalence principle is necessary for\nchronogeometric significance. For example, an alternative approach\nmight make appeal to the results of (Ehlers, Pirani & Schild,\n1972), in which the authors demonstrate that the trajectories of\nmassive and massless bodies are sufficient to reconstruct the metric\nfield in GTR (cf. (Malament 2012, \u00a72.1)). These issues are raised\nin (Read 2020a), but much work remains to be done in uncovering the\nfull range of ways in which a given piece of structure might come to\nhave chronogeometric significance.\n",
