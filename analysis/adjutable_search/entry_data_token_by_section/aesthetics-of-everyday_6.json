    "main_text": "Action-Oriented Aesthetics\n7. Action-Oriented Aesthetics\n\nSocial aesthetics also sheds light on another new avenue of inquiry\nushered in by everyday aesthetics: the aesthetic dimension of\ndoing things instead of, or in addition to, the experience\ngained as a spectator or beholder. The traditional mode of aesthetic\ninquiry is primarily concerned with analyzing the aesthetic experience\nof a spectator who derives aesthetic pleasure from contemplating an\nobject (or a phenomenon or an event). Even in such an experience, as\nDewey\u2019s characterization of \u2018undergoing\u2019 and\n\u2018doing\u2019 and Berleant\u2019s engagement model indicate,\nthe person is never passive; she is actively engaged with the object\nthrough exercising imagination and interacts with it perceptually,\nintellectually, and emotionally. However, in the most literal sense,\nshe is still an onlooker of the object: a painting, a symphony, a tea\nbowl, a figure skating performance, a flower garden, a piece of\nfurniture, an automobile, a house, and a freshly laundered shirt.\n\nWhile everyday aesthetics includes such spectator-oriented aesthetics,\na major part constituting the flow of everyday life is our active\nengagement with doing things by handling an object, executing an act,\nand producing certain results, all motivated by aesthetic\nconsiderations. Until recently, very little had been explored of the\naesthetic dimensions of active involvement in painting a canvas,\nplaying a violin, skating, gardening, repairing a garment, hanging\nlaundry outdoors, and giving birth (Rautio 2009; Brook 2012; Lintott\n2012). Perhaps food aesthetics illustrates this contrast most clearly.\nFood aesthetics generally focuses on the taste of the food rather than\nthe experience of eating itself or the activity of cooking (except for\nCurtin and Heldke 1992; Visser 1997; Giard 1998; Korsmeyer 1999;\nShusterman 2013; Perullo 2016).\n\nThe difficulty of accounting for the aesthetics involved in these\nactivities from the participants\u2019 perspective is the same\ndifficulty facing ambient aesthetics: the lack of clear delineation of\nobject-hood of aesthetic experience. The constituents of an aesthetic\nobject are more or less clear in the case of a painting or a flower\ngarden appreciated from the spectator\u2019s point of view.\nFurthermore, there is an object one can point to for\nintersubjectivity. However, there is no equivalent\n\u2018object\u2019 of aesthetic experience when it comes to an\nactivity one undertakes. This lack, according to some thinkers,\nsignals the demise of any reasonable discussion as the subject matter\nbecomes hopelessly private with little possibility of intersubjective\ndiscourse. While we can meaningfully debate the aesthetic merit of a\npainting or a flower garden by giving reasons to justify our judgment,\nit is difficult to imagine an equivalent discussion of my experience\nof bodily engagement when executing brush ink painting or digging the\nground and planting flowers for the flower garden.\n\nIf one accepts John Dewey\u2019s notion of having \u201can\nexperience\u201d which gives an aesthetic character to whatever\nexperience one is undergoing, it becomes a challenge to facilitate a\ncritical discourse to determine whether or not one is truly having\n\u201can experience.\u201d The act of planting flowers involves a\nmulti-sensory experience and bodily engagement, as well as designing\nthe garden\u2019s layout. These ingredients may come together in a\nunified manner to give rise to a sense of joy felt by the gardener at\nthe arrival of spring and the anticipation of fully-blossomed flowers.\nIt is difficult to imagine how this gardener\u2019s experience can be\nsubjected to a critical discourse in the same way the flower bed gets\nevaluated aesthetically for its design. Can we have a debate about\nwhether the gardener\u2019s experience was truly aesthetic or whether\nit provided a rich or only mediocre aesthetic experience? If not, is\nthis aspect of our life forever closed to any mode of aesthetic\ninquiry?\n\nThe difficulty felt here regarding the aesthetics of ambiance and\nactions could be attributed to the mode of contemporary Western\naesthetic inquiry which is predominantly judgment-oriented (B\u00f6hme\n1993). Much of mainstream aesthetic debate surrounds the objectivity\nand justifiability of aesthetic judgment. A judgment presupposes the\ndeterminability of an object and its intersubjectively sharable\nexperience. Anything falling outside of it is considered hopelessly\nsubjective and relativistic. However, phenomenological accounts of\nbodily engagement in cooking, sports, and other mundane activities are\nplentiful not only in some aestheticians\u2019 writings but also,\nperhaps more commonly, in writings by practitioners and literary\nauthors (Curtin and Heldke 1992; Giard 1998; Rautio 2009; Tainio\n2015). Body aesthetics is also garnering more attention in recent\nphilosophy and a large part of its concern is the bodily engagement in\naesthetic experience (Bhatt 2013; Irvin 2016).\n\nFurthermore, some agree that the practice of mundane activities,\ndomestic chores in particular, provides an opportunity for one to\nexercise imagination and creativity to inspire an aesthetic experience\n(McCracken 2001; Lee 2010; Highmore 2011a). For example, the activity\nof outdoor laundry hanging can be a chance for the person to arrange\nand hang the items in an aesthetically pleasing way to express her\nrespect and thoughtfulness toward her neighbors and passersby who are\ninevitably exposed to the visual parade of laundered items. At the\nsame time, this activity will occasion her appreciation of the arrival\nof spring after a long winter, as well as anticipation of the sweet\nsmell and crisp texture of dried items thanks to the sunshine and\nfresh air carried by the breeze (Rautio 2009; Saito 2017a). Dismissing\nthese experiences from aesthetic discourse because they do not fit the\nexpected format of analysis and cannot be subjected to a\nverdict-oriented discourse unduly impoverishes the rich content of our\naesthetic life. In addition, these experiences are not hopelessly\nprivate and it is possible that they are generated and shared\ncommunally. Gardening, cooking, and participation in sporting\nactivities can be a group activity and the participants can share and\nhelp with each other to mutually enrich and enhance aesthetic\nexperiences by pointing out the aesthetic contribution of some aspects\nthat others may have missed.\n\nIndeed, it is crucial for everyday aesthetics that these private\nexperiences to be intersubjectively communicable. If the aesthetic\ndimensions of our everyday life are important (and this conviction is\nwhat gave rise to everyday aesthetics in the fist place), then one of\nits tasks is to justify the value of seemingly monadistic experiences\nby facilitating what aesthetic experience in general does best:\nencouraging openness by sharing others\u2019 experiences, viewing the\nworld from perspectives different from one\u2019s own, and enlarging\none\u2019s horizon and vision (Ratiu 2017a). Aesthetic experience\nunderstood in this way supports its educability, educational value,\nand contribution to enhancing life (Potgieter 2017).\n",
