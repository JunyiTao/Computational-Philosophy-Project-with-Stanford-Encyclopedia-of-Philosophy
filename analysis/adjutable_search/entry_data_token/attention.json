The nature of this selectivity is one of the principal points\nof disagreement between the extant theories of attention. Some of the\nmost influential theories treat the selectivity of attention as\nresulting from limitations in the brain\u2019s capacity to process\nthe complex properties of multiple perceivable stimuli. Other theories\ntake the selectivity of attention to be the result of limitations in\nthe thinking subject\u2019s capacity to consciously entertain\nmultiple trains of thought. A third group attempt to account for\nattention\u2019s selectivity in ways that need not make any reference\nto limitations in capacity. These latter theories relate the\nselectivity of attention to the selectivity required to maintain a\nsingle coherent course of action, to the weighting of sensory\ninformation in accordance with its expected precision, or to\ncompetition between mutually inhibitory streams of processing.\n\nThe instances of attention differ along several dimensions of\nvariation. In some of its instances attention is a perceptual\nphenomenon. In other instances it is a phenomenon related to\naction. In some instances the selectivity of attention is\nvoluntary. In other instances it is driven, quite\nindependently of the subject\u2019s volition, by the high salience of\nattention-grabbing items in the perceptual field. The difficulty of\ngiving a unified theory of attention that applies to attention\u2019s\nvoluntary and involuntary instances, and to its perceptual and\nenactive instances, makes attention a topic of philosophical interest\nin its own right.\n\nAttention is also a topic of philosophical interest because of its\napparent relations to a number of other philosophically puzzling\nphenomena. There are empirical and theoretical considerations\nsuggesting that attention is closely related to\nconsciousness, and there are controversies over whether this\nrelationship is one of necessity, or sufficiency (or both or neither).\nThere are also controversies \u2013 thought to be important to the\nviability of representationism about consciousness \u2013 over the\nways in which the phenomenal character of a conscious experience can\nbe modulated by attention. Different considerations link attention to\ndemonstrative reference, to the development of an\nunderstanding of other minds, and to the exercise of the\nwill. Some work in the tradition of virtue ethics takes\nattention to be morally important, since there are at least\nsome virtues that require one to attend appropriately. Attention has\nalso been given a prominent role in some theories about the epistemic\nsignificance of emotion, and in some discussions of the\nepistemic peculiarities of self-attributed mental states.\n\nThe controversies concerning attention\u2019s relation to these other\nphenomena often include debates about the philosophical significance\nof theories that have been developed through the empirical study of\nattention at the neuropsychological and cognitive levels.\nAttention\u2019s cultural and economic aspects have also become a\npoint of philosophical interest, with some theorists suggesting that\nthe social significance of new media is primarily a consequence of the\nnovel ways in which those media engage and compete for our\nattention.\n", "toc": [{"#HisOve": "1.

Historical Overview\n1.1 Descartes: Attention and Epistemology\n\nIn the early modern period a variety of explanatory roles were\nassigned to attention by a number of different writers.\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations provides one prominent example.\nThe result of Descartes\u2019 First Meditation\u2014that everything\ncan be doubted\u2014is in apparent tension with his Third\nMeditation\u2019s claim that clear and distinct ideas are beyond\ndoubt. Descartes introduces a claim about attention to resolve this\napparent conflict. He says, in reply to the seventh set of objections,\nthat it is only when we pay attention to them that clear and distinct\nideas provide a place where doubt does not take hold:\n\nSo long as we attend to a truth which we perceive very clearly, we\ncannot doubt it. But when, as often happens, we are not attending to\nany truth in this way, then even though we remember that we have\npreviously perceived many things clearly, nevertheless there will be\nnothing which we may not justly doubt so long as we do not know that\nwhatever we clearly perceive is true. (\u2018Replies to\nObjections\u2019, 309)\n\n\nThis passage is usually cited for the point that it makes about\nmemory, but the picture that Descartes is here outlining is also one\nin which attention has an important epistemic role to play: clarity\nand distinctness realize their epistemic potential only when attention\nis being paid to the ideas that have them. Those ideas can be doubted,\nas, in accordance with the policy of the First Meditation they must\nbe, but that doubt cannot be maintained by a properly attentive\nthinker. The crucial first move in Descartes\u2019\nepistemology\u2014the move from radical doubt to certainty about the\ntruth of particular clear and distinct ideas\u2014is, therefore, a\ntransition that is mediated by attention.\n1.2 Berkeley: Attention and Abstraction\n\nA quite different explanatory role is assigned to attention in Bishop\nBerkeley\u2019s Principles of Human Knowledge, although here\nagain we find that it is in order to remove an epistemological glitch\nthat the notion of attention is brought in. In the Introduction to\nPrinciples of Human Knowledge Berkeley rejects Locke\u2019s\nclaim that there exist such things as Abstract Ideas. But Berkeley\nretains Locke\u2019s commitment to the core empiricist claim that the\nthinking of thoughts is always a matter of handling ideas received\nfrom experience. This would seem to lead to the conclusion that it is\nnot possible to think about abstractia, but Berkeley realizes that\nthat conclusion is unacceptable. It is, as he says, perfectly possible\nto think about the properties of triangles in general.\n\nIn the second edition of the Principles Berkeley added a\ncouple of sentences to the Introduction that make it clear that it is\nattention and, in particular, the withholding of attention, that is\nsupposed to explain the possibility of thinking about abstractia\nwithout the need to postulate Abstract Ideas. These added sentences\ntell us that:\n\n[It] must be acknowledged that a man may consider a figure merely\nas triangular, without attending to the particular qualities of the\nangles or relations of the sides. So far he may abstract, but\nthis will never prove that he can frame an abstract general,\ninconsistent idea of a triangle. (1710, Introduction to 2nd edn.\n\u00a716. emphasis added)\n\n\nIn these sentences Berkeley is not attempting to elaborate a theory of\nattention. He says nothing more about the idea that attention might\nenable thought about abstractia. It is nonetheless clear that he\nrequires attention to play an important role in his picture of the\nmind.\n\nBerkeley\u2019s idea that attention and abstraction are linked was\ntaken up in the second half of the nineteenth century by William\nHamilton. Hamilton did not, however, think that the link between\nattention and abstraction provided the starting point for an\nexplanation of attention, nor of abstraction. That is because he took\nit that the relationship between the two phenomena was too intimate to\nbe explanatory. He writes that:\n\nAttention and Abstraction are only the same process viewed in\ndifferent relations. They are, as it were, the positive and negative\npoles of the same act. (1876, 88)\n\n1.3 Locke: Attention as a Mode of Thought\n\nDescartes and Berkeley treat attention very briefly, but each assigns\nattention to a particular explanatory role. Locke\u2019s treatment of\nattention is also brief, but he has his own theory of the explanatory\nrole that attention plays, and goes further than either Descartes or\nBerkeley in giving us a positive account of what attention is. His\naccount is given as part of the catalogue of \u2018Modes of\nThinking\u2019, which Locke sets out towards the beginning of Chapter\nNineteen of Book Two of the Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding:\n\n[W]hen ideas float in our mind without any reflection or regard of the\nunderstanding, it is that which the French call reverie; our language\nhas scarce a name for it: when the ideas that offer themselves\n(for, as I have observed in another place, whilst we are awake, there\nwill always be a train of ideas succeeding one another in our minds)\nare taken notice of, and, as it were, registered in the memory, it is\nattention: when the mind with great earnestness, and of choice,\nfixes its view on any idea, considers it on all sides, and will not be\ncalled off by the ordinary solicitation of other ideas, it is that we\ncall \u201cintention,\u201d or \u201cstudy.\u201d (1689, II, 19\n\u00a71 emphasis added)\n\n\nIn addition to providing these quick theories of\n\u2018reverie\u2019, \u2018attention\u2019 and \u2018intention or\nstudy\u2019, the very same sentence of Locke\u2019s Essay\nprovides theories of \u2018remembrance\u2019,\n\u2018recollection\u2019, \u2018contemplation\u2019,\n\u2018sleep\u2019, \u2018dreaming\u2019, and\n\u2018ecstasy\u2019. It is significant that Locke\u2019s account of\nattention is given so briefly, and that it goes by as part of a crowd\nof theories of these various other mental phenomena. Locke is not here\nengaging in an uncharacteristically slapdash piece of rapid-fire\ntheorizing. His intention in going through this catalogue is to\nestablish that these are topics for which no new substantive theory is\nneeded. These are, in Locke\u2019s theory, simply \u2018modes of\nthinking\u2019: \u2018reverie\u2019, \u2018study\u2019 etc. are\nnot names for independent phenomena, existing in their own right.\nInstead they are the various names that thinking is given when it\ntakes place in various ways.\n\nOne consequence of Locke\u2019s treatment of attention as a mode of\nthinking is that, once we have a theory of thinking before us, we need\nno further theory to account for the possibility of attention,\ncontemplation, study, etc. (Just as, to use the classic example of\n\u2018modes\u2019, we need no substantive independent theory, once\nwe have a theory of walking, to explain the possibility of limping,\npacing or ambling.) We need to say something in giving an\nanalysis of the nature of modes, but\u2014once the\nthing-to-be-modified has been accounted for\u2014our analysis can\nsimply say something brief, along the lines indicated by Locke. We do\nnot need to give a theory that postulates any substances or processes\nspecific to the explanation of attention.\n\nLocke\u2019s modal view of attention has the consequence that no very\nsubstantive theory of attention is needed once our theory of thinking\nis in place. It also entails, and for the same reason, that attention\ncannot figure in the explanation of how thinking itself is possible\n(for any explanation in which it did figure would be analogous to an\nexplanation of walking that takes strolling to already be possible; it\nwould get its explanatory priorities backwards).\n1.4 The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries: Attention in Perception, in Action and in Reflective Thought\n\nLocke viewed attention as an explanatorily slight phenomenon\u2014a\nmode of thought that is not in need of much explanation, nor capable\nof providing much. Theories of attention moved away from that view\nover the course of the eighteenth century. Attention was increasingly\ntreated as a phenomenon with explanatory work to do, and so as a\nphenomenon for which a substantive independent theory needed to be\ngiven. The attempt to provide such a theory got properly underway in\n1738, when Christian Wolff\u2019s textbook on psychology was the\nfirst to devote a whole chapter to the topic of attention (see\nHatfield, 1995, for an excellent discussion).\n\nDuring this period the explanatory remit for theories of attention\nbroadened in two directions. The first move was away from the idea\nthat attention acts on already-received ideas and towards the idea\nthat attention is involved in the initial reception of those ideas.\nLocke had characterized attention as the registration of\nalready-received ideas into memory. But by 1769, when Henry Home Kames\nadded the appendix of \u2018Terms Defined or Explained\u2019 to his\nElements of Criticism, attention\u2019s role as a regulator\nof cognitive input was regarded as definitive of it:\n\nAttention is that state of mind which prepares one to receive\nimpressions. According to the degree of attention objects make a\nstrong or weak impression. Attention is requisite even to the simple\nact of seeing. (1769, 18)\n\n\nAs well as beginning to assign to attention a role in the explanation\nof the reception of ideas, eighteenth century theories also moved\ntowards including a role for attention in the production of\nbehaviour. This is particularly clear in Dugald\nStewart\u2019s 1792 Elements of the Philosophy of the Human\nMind. Stewart retains Locke\u2019s view that attention has an\nessential role to play in determining which things get stored in\nmemory. He adds to that view the claim that attention has a role in\ndetermining which particular memories get recalled, writing that\n\u201cSome attention [is] necessary for any act of memory\nwhatever.\u201d (1792, 53). Stewart also claims that attention has a\nrole in the explanation of the development and deployment of at least\nsome skilled behaviours. The example that Stewart gives here is that\nof \u201cthe dexterity of jugglers\u201d which, he says,\n\u201cmerits a greater degree of attention from philosophers than it\nhas yet attracted\u201d (62).\n\nIn the century between Locke\u2019s Essay and\nStewart\u2019s Elements, then, attention ceases to be seen\nmerely as a certain mode of idea-handling, and comes to be seen as a\nphenomenon in need of its own explanation, and with a role to play in\nthe explanation of perception, in the explanation of skilled action,\nand in the explanation of memory (both in its storage and in its\nrecall).\n\nIn the century after Stewart\u2019s Elements the diversity\namong the phenomena that attention was expected to explain continued\nto grow, and it continued to include phenomena from across the\npsychological spectrum from perception, to thought, to action. By the\nend of the nineteenth century, in what was a crucial period in the\ndevelopment of scientific psychology, there were some psychologists,\nsuch as E.B. Titchener, who took the role of attention in perception\nand in \u2018sensory clearness\u2019 to be its most essential\nfeature (see Titchener, 1908, 1910); others, such as Alexander Bain,\nwho thought that the essential feature of attention was its role in\naction, (Bain, 1888); and a third group, of whom G.F. Stout was the\nmost prominent example, who argued that the primary job for a theory\nof attention was to explain attention\u2019s role in reflective\nthought (see Stout, 1891).\n\nAs a result of this diversity in their conceptions of\nattention\u2019s explanatory remit (and as a result of the lack of\nany established methodology for empirical psychology) the debates\nbetween exponents of these various psychological theories of attention\ngot themselves into what was acknowledged to be a \u2018chaotic\nstate\u2019 (Pillsbury, 1906).\n1.5 William James and His Contemporaries: Deflationary Theories\n\nThe diversity of explanatory roles assigned to attention in the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries meant that theorizing about\nattention at the end of the nineteenth century was in a chaotic state.\nThe ambition for theorists of attention writing at the end of the\nnineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries was to get\nthis chaos into order. The theories of attention proposed in this\nperiod therefore tended to take the form of attempts to reveal\nattention as something less mysterious and less complex than earlier\nwriters had supposed. This ambition to give a \u2018nothing\nbut\u2026\u2019 reduction of attention can be seen in the most\ninfluential work from this period: William James\u2019 The\nPrinciples of Psychology (1890).\n\nOne aspect of James\u2019 approach is to play down the more complex\nperceptual aspects of attention. His chapter on attention includes a\ndiscussion of experiments into what we now call\n\u2018subitizing\u2019\u2014that is, into the ability to perceive\nthe cardinality of small stimulus sets without needing to count their\nmembers\u2014but James writes of these experiments that it \u201cis\nobvious that such observations decide nothing at all about our\nattention, properly so called\u201d (407).\n\nAlthough James plays down attention\u2019s role in complex perceptual\nphenomena, he does assign attention to an important explanatory role\nin the production of behaviour. He claims, for example, that\n\u2018Volition is nothing but attention\u2019 (424). But when James\nmakes such claims it is as part of a general project that seeks always\nto be deflationary where possible. When James associates attention\nwith volition it is as a way of suggesting how volition could be given\na deflationary treatment, not as a way of inflating attention\u2019s\nexplanatory role.\n\nThis deflationary approach to attention\u2019s explanatory remit\nmeans that, when it comes to giving an account of the \u2018intimate\nnature of the attention process\u2019, James can identify two fairly\nsimple processes which, he claims, \u2018probably coexist in all our\nconcrete attentive acts\u2019. and which \u2018possibly form in\ncombination a complete reply\u2019 to the question of\nattention\u2019s \u2018intimate nature\u2019 (1890, 411). The\nprocesses that James identifies are:\n\nThe accommodation or adjustment of the sensory organs, and\nThe anticipatory preparation from within of the ideational centres\nconcerned with the object to which attention is paid. (411)\n\n\nThe first of these processes is reasonably familiar. By \u2018the\naccommodation or adjustment of the sensory organs\u2019 James means\nsuch processes as pointing one\u2019s ears in the right direction,\nbringing one\u2019s eyes into focus, taking a sniff, and so on.\n\nJames\u2019s talk of \u2018anticipatory preparation\u2019 of\n\u2018ideation centres\u2019 is a little less clear, but the point\nis again a quite straightforward one. What James has in mind here is\nsimply imagination. His claim is that when attention does not\ninvolve adjusting one\u2019s sense organs it consists in imagining\nthe things or actions that one is attending to, or looking for.\n\nJames illustrates his claim about attention\u2019s link to\nimagination with an example from Hermann von Helmholtz. This example\nis an important one for James, and it illustrates some important\nfeatures of attention that subsequent theorists have tended to\nneglect. The example involves the variety of attention that needs to\nbe paid when trying to discern the overtones in a note played on the\npiano. Helmholtz asks us to sit at the piano and to play a G, then,\nimagining the sound that we have just heard, to play a low C. Doing\nthis, it is claimed, enables one to hear that G is discernibly there\n(as the third overtone) within the sound produced when C is played.\nHelmholtz\u2019s claim, which James endorses, is that the kind of\nattention that is paid when listening for an overtone is constituted\nby the imagining of what that overtone would sound like. James goes\nonto claim that there is a wide range of cases in which paying\nattention to what one is doing consists in this same sort of\npreparatory imaginative engagement.\n\nHere, as in his more frequently discussed treatment of emotion, it is\ndistinctive of James\u2019s approach that he tries to account for a\nlarge-scale personal-level psychological phenomenon in a realist but\nsomewhat revisionary way, so as to be able to give his account using\nrelatively simple and unmysterious explanatory resources. An\nalternative deflationary approach\u2014one which James explicitly\ncontrasted with his own\u2014is the approach taken in 1886 by F.H.\nBradley.\n\nBradley advocated a view according to which attention is not the sort\nof phenomenon for which an independent and substantive theory can or\nneeds to be given. Bradley does not develop this point in much detail,\nand it is a point on which he would later change his mind, but in his\n1886 article, \u2018Is there a special activity of attention?\u2019,\nBradley was concerned with arguing that a project such as\nJames\u2019s one of identifying particular processes as the\nattention-constituting ones was wrongheaded. He claims that no\nparticular attention-processes can be identified since:\n\nAny function whatever of the body or the mind will be active attention\nif it is prompted by an interest and brings about the result of our\nengrossment with its product. There is no primary act of attention,\nthere is no specific act of attention, there is no one kind of act of\nattention at all. (1886, 316)\n\n\nAlthough Bradley does not use the Lockean vocabulary (and although\nJames himself does not seem to have taken Bradley in this way),\nBradley\u2019s position here has much in common with Locke\u2019s\nclaim that attention is a mode. Bradley\u2019s position,\nlike Locke\u2019s, is that what is essential to an instance of\nattention is not the matter of which processes are taking\nplace, but the facts about how the things that happen happen.\nHe therefore takes the ennumeration of processes to be the wrong form\nfor a theory of attention to take.\n\nOther writers who were contemporary with Bradley and James took\ndifferent approaches to the project of giving a deflationary\nexplanation of attention. In Th\u00e9odule Ribot\u2019s 1888 book\nLa Psychologie De L\u2019Attention the attempt to explain\nattention took an approach that we would now classify as behaviourist.\nIn 1888 behaviourism had not yet been established as a general\napproach in philosophical or psychological theories of the mind, but\nRibot\u2019s suggestion that attention\u2019s behavioural\nmanifestations are essential to it is nonetheless recognizable as an\nearly articulation of behaviourism in a strong form:\n\nAre the movements of the face, the body, and the limbs and the\nrespiratory modifications that accompany attention, simple effects,\noutward marks, as is usually supposed? Or are they, on the contrary,\nthe necessary conditions, the constituent elements, the\nindispensable factors of attention? Without hesitation we accept\nthe second thesis. (1888, 19)\n\n\nA somewhat more moderate version of this behaviour-centred approach\nwas taken by Alexander Bain, who identified attention, not with its\nbehavioural manifestations themselves, but with truncated versions of\nthe motor-control processes that typically bring about those\nbehavioural manifestations: processes \u2018stopping short of the\nactual movement performed by the organ\u2019 (Bain, 1888, 371). Much\nas Ribot\u2019s view can be seen as an early version of behaviourism,\nBain\u2019s view can be seen as an early version of the motor-based\napproaches to attention that can be found in the literature of the\npresent century (see\n Section 2.8\n below).\n1.6 The Twentieth Century: Locating Attention at a Bottleneck in Information Processing\n\nThe variety among the deflationary explanatory approaches that\ncharacterized the theories of attention offered in the nineteenth\ncentury gave way in the early twentieth century to a period in which\none such explanatory tactic was dominant: the tactic of behaviourism.\nBehaviourists tended to neglect attention, but did not ignore it\nentirely. John Dashiell\u2019s 1928 Fundamentals of Objective\nPsychology, for example, is a behaviourist work that attempts to\naccount for attention \u201cas a form of posturing\u201d (Ch. 10,\n\u00a73). The project of identifying a behaviour with which to explain\nattention was, nonetheless, an understandably unpopular one. As\nGilbert Ryle notes, it is not only attention, but also \u2018heed\nconcepts\u2019 more generally, that resist simple behaviourist\nanalysis:\n\n[W]hen a man is described as driving carefully, whistling with\nconcentration or eating absent-mindedly the special character of his\nactivity seem to elude the observer, the camera and the Dictaphone.\nPerhaps knitted brows, taciturnity and fixed gaze may be evidence of\nintentness; but these can be simulated, or they can be purely\nhabitual. (1949, 133)\n\n\nIn the middle of the twentieth century behaviourism\u2019s dominance\nwaned, cognitive psychology established itself, and a new theoretical\napproach to the explanation of attention was developed. These three\ndevelopments were intimately related to one another. Instrumental to\nall three was the publication in 1958 of Donald Broadbent\u2019s\nPerception and Communication.\n\nThe year prior to Perception and Communication\u2019s\npublication had seen B.F. Skinner\u2019s attempt, in Verbal\nBehaviour (1957), to apply a behaviourist explanatory approach to\ndistinctively human aspects of cognition. Skinner\u2019s project in\nthat book failed, and Noam Chomsky\u2019s famous 1959 review of the\nbook made its failure conspicuous. Chomsky\u2019s own work in\nSyntactic Structures (1957) went some way towards\nestablishing the new cognitive paradigm for psychology by showing how\ninternal processing could be theorized by describing transformations\non representations in abstraction from the question of how those\nrepresentations were realized. Donald Broadbent\u2019s distinctive\ncontribution to the overthrow of behaviourism was to show how the move\nfrom behavioural data to the postulation of a particular cognitive\narchitecture could be disciplined by the then-new strategy of\nimporting into psychology the intellectual resources used in thinking\nabout information technology. The year in which Broadbent\u2019s book\nwas published was an important year for the development of such\ntechnologies, being the year in which (inter alia) the integrated\ncircuit chip was invented (see Mole, 2012). It was also the year in\nwhich Subscriber Trunk Dialling was introduced to UK telephone\nexchanges. The technology of the telephone exchange was what most\nnaturally suggested itself as a metaphor for attention at the time\nwhen Broadbent was writing.\n\nTowards the end of Perception and Communication Broadbent\nexplicitly sets out the claim that the theoretical resources developed\nin thinking about the transmission of information through telephone\nexchanges provide the basis for an alternative to behaviourism. He\nalso attacks the positivistic methodological principles that had given\nmany behaviourists their motivation. But the central lesson from\nBroadbent\u2019s work, so far as the theory of attention goes, is a\nlesson that he takes to be independent of this attack on behaviourism\nand its positivist foundations. At an early stage in Perception\nand Communication he remarks that:\n\nPerhaps the point of permanent value which will remain in psychology\nif the fashion for communication theory wanes, will be the emphasis on\nproblems of capacity. [\u2026] The fact that any given channel has a\nlimit is a matter of central importance to communication engineers,\nand it is correspondingly forced on the attention of psychologists who\nuse their terms. (1958, 5)\n\n\nThis introduction of the notion of capacity limitations into\ndiscussions of perception and attention was, as Broadbent here\npredicted, hugely and permanently influential.\n\nBroadbent claimed not only that the human brain is subject to capacity\nlimitations of the sort that communications engineers had learnt to\ntheorize, he claimed also that these limitations are clustered so that\nthere is a single bottleneck in capacity that is especially critical\nto the brain\u2019s handling of perceptual information. This\nbottleneck was said to occur at the junction of two systems operating\nin series, with the first system having a large capacity for\ninformation processing, and operating automatically on all of the\nstimuli with which the perceiving subject is presented, while the\nsecond has a much smaller capacity, and therefore needs to be deployed\nselectively.\n\nThose who followed Broadbent took it that the bottleneck that results\nfrom the connection of these two systems corresponds to attention in\nthe sense that, when a representation of a stimulus passes through\nthat bottleneck, the stimulus ipso facto counts as one to\nwhich attention has been paid.\n\nBroadbent himself was cautious about presenting his claims about\ncapacity-bottlenecks as a theory of attention. The word\n\u2018attention\u2019 occurs rarely in Perception and\nCommunication. Broadbent\u2019s later book, Decision and\nStress (1971), does describe his earlier experiments as\n\u2018studies of attention\u2019, but here too Broadbent prefers to\ntalk about \u2018selective perception\u2019 (chapter V) or\n\u2018vigilance\u2019 (chapters II and III). In an article from\n1982, entitled, \u2018Task Combination and Selective Intake of\nInformation\u2019, he admits that: \u201cThe topic of this paper is\none that is often termed \u2018attention\u2019, and it may seem\nunduly artificial to have given it a more cumbrous title.\u201d But\nhe goes on to reassert his qualms:\n\n\u2018Attention\u2019 is a word in ordinary language, that can\nreasonably be used as a label for experiments in a particular area.\nYet it has also been used as a theoretical concept, a mysterious asset\nor energy which is sometimes attached to human functions and sometimes\nnot. This use of attention [\u2026] is not very helpful, and\navoiding the word in the title is a step towards clarity. (1982, 253)\n\n\nWhen Broadbent does use the word \u2018attention\u2019 it is mostly\nin discussions of attention shifting. His view, at least in\nhis early work, seems to have been that where there is a bottleneck in\nour information processing capacity there need to be additional\nmechanisms that control how our limited capacity resources will be\ndeployed. These additional mechanisms of bottleneck-control\nseem to have been what Broadbent thought of as the attention\nmechanisms. He never took himself to have given a theory of them, only\nto have given a theory of where they would be needed. Nor were these\nmechanisms the topic that was at issue in the debates about attention\nthat Broadbent prompted. Those debates were concerned with questions\nabout the nature and location of the bottleneck itself, not about the\nfactors that determine what, on any particular occasion, gets to pass\nthrough it.\n\nIn the decades following Broadbent a great many psychologists devoted\nthemselves to the task of locating the attentional bottleneck that he\nhad postulated. Almost all psychologists writing at this time were\nguided to some degree by Broadbent\u2019s\ntwo-serial-systems-and-a-bottleneck picture of perceptual processing.\nThe question of whether a given task is attention demanding was\ntherefore understood to depend on the question of whether the\nperformance of that task requires the engagement of the small-capacity\nsystem that comes after the bottleneck of attention.\u00a0 Research\ninto the attention-related demands of particular tasks therefore\nbecame another route by which to approach the issue of where the\nattentional bottleneck is located. Broadbent\u2019s\ntwo-systems-and-a-bottleneck model was frequently questioned, but for\nmost research into attention in the second half of the twentieth\ncentury it was very much the orthodox view. This has now changed. In\npsychology\u2019s current paradigm, only a few aspects of\nBroadbent\u2019s picture remain orthodox.\n2. Theories of Attention\n2.1 Capacity-Limitation Theories\n\nPsychologists attempting to produce a theory of attention in the\nnineteen sixties and seventies were highly influenced by Donald\nBroadbent\u2019s picture of attention as corresponding to a\nbottleneck in information processing capacity resulting from the\nconnection of two separate perceptual processing systems. The first\npiece of business for these psychologists was to locate this\nattentional bottleneck, by determining which sorts of processing are\ndone by the large capacity, pre-bottleneck system, and which by the\nsmall capacity, post-bottleneck system. Debates between these\npsychologists gave rise to various theories in which the selectivity\nof attention was characterized with a claim about the location of this\nbottleneck.\n2.1.1 Early Selection Theory\n\nBroadbent\u2019s own account of the distribution of processing\nbetween the pre-attentional system and the post-attentional system\ndefines the \u2018early selection\u2019 theory of attention. He\nclaimed that only very simple properties are detected by the large\ncapacity system, and that any semantic properties, or any properties\nrelating to the particular identity of a stimulus, are\ndetected only after representations of the stimulus have passed\nthrough the attentional-bottleneck and into the smaller capacity\nsystem.\n\nThe personal-level consequences of this early selection theory are\nthat we can recognize what things are and what they mean only if we\nare paying attention to them, but can detect the simple physical\nproperties of things even when paying no attention to them. The theory\ncan be thought of as a communication-theoretic rendering of two\nintuitive ideas, which Broadbent\u2019s own research had put on an\nempirically sound footing. The first is that one has no immediate\ncontrol over one\u2019s awareness of simple features of one\u2019s\nenvironment, such as the fact that there are people talking in the\nnext room. Whatever one is paying attention to, one will continue to\nhear some chatter to be going on, if any is. The second idea is that\nthe details of things\u2014such as the semantic content of that\nchatter\u2014can be detected only for the one or two things to which\none is paying attention: If one wants to know what the chatter is\nabout, one has to listen, and this involves disengaging one\u2019s\nattention from other things that might be happening.\n\nThe early selection theory also entails, more problematically, that\nthe semantic properties of an unattended item must remain\nunrepresented in the nervous system, and so entails that those\nproperties can have no psychological effects. According to this view\nthe semantic features of unattended items cannot explain why those\nitems attract attention to themselves, on the occasions when they do.\nIt was to this aspect of the theory that its opponents most frequently\nobjected.\n2.1.2 Late Selection Theory\n\nThe chief rivals of Broadbent\u2019s early selection theory were the\n\u2018late selectionists\u2019, who claimed that all (or almost all)\nperceivable properties are detected automatically, by a large capacity\nsystem that operates on all of the stimuli with which the perceiving\nsubject is presented. According to this late selection theory of\nattention the consequences of passing through the bottleneck of\nattention into the post-attentive small capacity system are only (1)\nthat the subject comes to be conscious of the contents that the large\ncapacity system has already succeeded in encoding and (2) that those\ncontents come to be stored in working memory (Deutsch and Deutsch,\n1963).\n\nAlthough it was originally proposed against the background of\nBroadbent\u2019s now superseded theoretical framework, it would be\ntoo quick to dismiss the late selection theory as an obsolete one. The\ntheory has much in common with some plausible and empirically\nwell-supported views found in the more recent literature. Jesse Prinz,\nfor example, shares the late selectionists\u2019 view that\nattention\u2019s primary role is not in managing limited perceptual\nprocessing resources, but in projecting already-processed\nrepresentations to working memory. Prinz\u2019s view, varying a theme\nfrom the work of Stanislas Dehaene, is that this projection to working\nmemory is what makes it the case that the content represented comes to\nconscious awareness. (Prinz, 2005, 2012, Dehaene et al.,\n2006).\n\nIt should be noted that Prinz\u2019s main philosophical business is\nwith the explanation of consciousness. Objections have been\nraised as to whether the process of projection to working\nmemory\u2014which Prinz refers to as\n\u2018attention\u2019\u2014can adequately account for the various\nthings that attention does (Wu, 2014, \u00a76.3.2). If it cannot then\nPrinz is willing to allow that this process is not the sole referent\nof the English word \u2018attention\u2019, writing that \u2018other\nresearchers may choose to define attention differently\u2019, and\nthat \u2018those who disagree with my analysis of attention could\nsimply drop the term \u201cattention\u201d\u2019 (Prinz, 2012, p.\n95).\n\nThe central component of the late-selection theory, as it was\noriginally understood, was that the effect of withdrawing attention\nfrom a stimulus is to make it the case that that stimulus is processed\nwithout the subject\u2019s awareness, rather than not being processed\nat all. This component of the view has, to some extent, been\nvindicated. The claim that unattended stimuli are subjected to some\nprocessing of which the subject lacks awareness, including some\nprocessing of those stimuli\u2019s semantic properties, is now\nuncontroversial. Since we know that the semantic properties of\nunattended stimuli can, for example, produce negative priming effects\n(Tipper and Driver, 1988), we know that unattended stimuli are\nprocessed in a way that allows at least some of their semantic\nproperties to be encoded. The semantic properties of unattended items\nhave such effects despite the fact that experimental participants are\ntypically unaware of what those properties are.\n\nThe traditional late selection theory is right in taking it that\ninattention can lead to properties being encoded without our\nawareness, rather than not being encoded at all, but that theory is\nalso committed to the claim that attention\u2019s only\neffects are in determining what gets remembered and experienced, so\nthat the direction of attention has no effects on the initial\nperceptual processing to which stimuli are subjected. These latter\nclaims we now know to be false. An important experiment by\nO\u2019Connor et al. used fMRI to compare neural activity in\nparticipants who, in various task conditions, were presented with high\nand low contrast checkerboard patterns in one or other half of their\nvisual field (O\u2019Connor et al. 2002). In some conditions\nthese participants had to perform a task involving these checkerboard\npatterns. In other conditions the patterns were irrelevant to the task\nthat the participants were performing (and in a third condition no\npattern was presented, but the participants were attending to the\nscreen in anticipation of a pattern that was about to be presented).\nThe results of these comparisons reveal that even in the first parts\nof the neural circuitry through which information from the retina\npasses, on its way to the visual cortex\u2014even, that is, in the\nLateral Geniculate Nuclei\u2014there is a difference in the baserate\nof neural activity, and a difference in the response that stimuli\nelicit, depending on what the participant is attending to. These\nfindings indicate that attention\u2019s effects are not limited to\ncortical loci that are upstream from a late process of attentional\nselection. They therefore refute any version of the late-selection\ntheory according to which the selectivity of attention is entirely a\n\u2018late process\u2019, occurring only after initial perceptual\nencoding is complete.\n\nThe findings of O\u2019Connor et al. create fewer problems\nfor some recent theories in which elements of the late selection view\nare retained. Nilli Lavie and her collaborators have proposed one such\ntheory, which attempts to combine some aspects of the late selection\ntheory with some aspects of its early selectionist rival. According to\nLavie\u2019s \u2018load theory\u2019, attention does\ncorrespond to a capacity bottleneck\u2014much as Broadbent\nthought\u2014but the differing demands of the task that is at hand\nlead to differences as to where that bottleneck restricts the\nprocessing of a stimulus: in conditions where the processing demands\nof perception are high the available resources will soon be exhausted,\nand the bottleneck will operate at an early stage, with the result\nthat unattended stimuli will be processed rather little; in conditions\nwhere the processing load of perception is lower the bottleneck will\noperate at a later stage, with the result that unattended stimuli will\nbe processed rather more (Lavie & Tsal, 1994, Lavie et\nal. 2004). This load theory predicts that peripheral stimuli will\nelicit less neural activation, and will be less distracting, when the\nsubject\u2019s task is a perceptually demanding one. These\npredictions have been borne out by behavioural and neurological\nobservations (Lavie, 2005).\u00a0 The theory\u2019s theoretical apparatus\nhas also provided a useful framework for the philosophical treatment\nof attention\u2019s relationship to consciousness (Hine, 2010). Many\npsychologists nonetheless continue to be wary of Lavie\u2019s\nrehabilitation of elements from the Broadbentian framework.\n\nOther theories have been proposed that also retain the Broadbentian\nidea that attentional selectivity is the result of capacity\nlimitations, while retreating further than Lavie from the picture of\nattention that Broadbent introduced. These theories reject the terms\nof the debate between early and late selectionists because they reject\nthe idea that the capacity limitations responsible for attention are\nclustered into a single bottleneck. In some cases this is because the\nselectivity of attention is taken to be the result of\nmultiple bottlenecks in processing capacity (see, e.g.,\nJohnston and McCann, 2006). In other cases it is because these\ntheorists see capacity limitations as occurring throughout the\nprocessing stream, and not as clustered into bottlenecks at all (see\nDriver, 2001, for a suggestion along these lines, and Allport, Antonis\n& Reynolds, 1972, for an earlier indication of it).\n2.1.3 Other Capacity-Limitation Theories\n\nThe early and late selection theories dominated discussions of\nattention in the decades following Broadbent\u2019s seminal work, but\nby the beginning of the nineteen nineties it had become clear that the\ndebate between advocates of the early selection theory and advocates\nof the late selection theory had become fruitless. Those debates were\ntherefore thought to have been predicated on some sort of mistaken\nassumption. Several different diagnoses have been proposed as to what\nthat mistaken assumption might have been. Little consensus has been\nreached as to which of these diagnoses is correct, with the result\nthat some theorists\u2014such as those discussed at the end of the\npreceding section\u2014retain ideas from the early and late selection\ntheories, while others regard this as a wrong-headedly retrograde\nstep.\n\nOne diagnosis is that the early/late debate was fruitless because the\nterms \u2018early\u2019 and \u2018late\u2019 are themselves\nproblematic. If perceptual processing occurs in a parallel processing\narchitecture without any prevailing direction of information flow then\nthere can be no sense in labeling one part of that architecture as\nearlier or later than any other. If the attentional bottleneck is\nlocated in a system that has such an architecture then it may be this\nthat explains why there was no satisfactory answer to the question of\nwhether attentional selection is early or late. It seems to have been\nwith this thought in mind that some writers have suggested that the\nfailure of the debate between early and late selection theories was\nowing to the fact that that debate requires us to make an assumption\nabout the linearity of the processing stream in which\nselection occurs (see, e.g., Prinz and Hommel, 2002, 3). This is a\nthought that needs to be treated with care.\n\nThe claim that it was a problematic assumption about linearity that\nled the early/late selection debate into fruitlessness received its\nmost influential treatment in an important paper by Alan Allport\n(Allport, 1992). Allport identifies several problematic assumptions\nthat the early/late selection debate requires. His characterization of\nwhat he takes to be the problematic assumption about linearity is as\nthe claim that:\n\n[T]he processing of nonsemantic attributes (i.e. the processing of\nattributes other than symbolic or categorical identity) occurs earlier\nin a logical/causal sequence of operations than does any semantic or\ncategorical processing. (1992, 187)\n\n\nDespite Allport\u2019s qualms, this assumption about linearity does not\nseem, on the face of it, to be a problematic one. There is nothing to\nbe objected to in the claim that the situations in which we encounter\na written word and come to be in a position to know what that word\nmeans are typically situations in which our sensory transducers\nrespond firstly to simple nonsemantic properties of the word. In order\nfor creatures like us to detect the semantic properties of written\nwords, it is necessary for our information processing systems\nto first encode some information about the simple spatial properties\nof the lines on the page. This information does then get passed on to\nsubsequent processing stages in which more complex properties,\nconcerned with semantics and stimulus identity, get processed. If this\nsort of linearity is what Allport was taking issue with then it seems\nhe must have been mistaken, since there is nothing problematic about\nthe idea that there is this much linearity in the processing to which\nstimuli are subjected.\n\nNor is there anything unscientific about that idea. It continues to be\nentirely normal for neuroscientists to refer to the processing that\ntakes place in occipital brain areas as \u2018early\u2019 and the\nprocessing in frontal areas as \u2018late\u2019. Such thinking can\nbe seen in a much-cited review of neuroimaging work on attention, in\nwhich Sabine Kastner and Leslie Ungerleider speak of:\n\n\u2026 an increase in the complexity of processing as activity\nproceeds anteriorly through the ventral stream into the temporal lobe.\nWhereas posterior regions in cortex are preferentially activated\nduring the processing of object attributes, such as colors or\nscrambled objects and faces, more anterior regions are activated\nselectively during the processing of intact objects and faces. (2000,\n319)\n\n\nThe orthodox view, expressed here by Kastner and Ungerleider, is\nsubject to differing interpretations. Those who believe that\nperception and cognition are best thought of as arising from a\nhierarchical Bayesian process might reject the idea that information\nprogresses through the nervous system in a bottom-up fashion, with the\ndetection of simple properties happening at an early stage, and the\ndetection of more complex properties happening at a later one. Current\nadvocates of such hierarchical Bayesian theories place great emphasis\non the idea that the prior hypotheses required by a Bayesian inference\ncan be generated in a top-down fashion, and can then be tested against\nincoming signals which contain information only about the ways in\nwhich the predictions generated by those hypotheses are in error\n(Hohwy, 2013). Such theories break from the tradition of thinking\nabout the information flow in the brain as being largely one-way, but\nthey retain the idea that information is organized into a structure\nwith earlier and later stages, with these stages now being understood\nas corresponding to the more or less abstract layers in an\nhierarchically organized Bayesian inference. They therefore retain the\nidea that there are earlier and later stages in the processing of any\ngiven stimulus, while rejecting the idea that there is one predominant\ndirection of information flow in the brain. Since this much linearity\nremains in our current thinking about the architecture of perceptual\nprocessing, we cannot coherently blame an assumption about this much\nlinearity for the troubles that led to the fruitlessness of the debate\nbetween early and late selectionists.\n\nThat is not to say that the early/late selection debate was entirely\nfree of problematic assumptions relating to linearity\u2014only that\npsychology has not yet settled upon a satisfactory account of the way\nin which assumptions about linearity led the early/late debate into\ntrouble.\n\nA reason why assumptions about linearity may have been problematic is\nthat when, following Broadbent, we think about hierarchical perceptual\nprocessing while bearing in mind the communications\nengineer\u2019s concerns about capacity limitations, it then\nbecomes natural to make some additional assumptions about the way in\nwhich this hierarchically organized architecture supports\npersonal-level cognition. The early/late debate\u2019s problems are\nmore plausibly blamed on these additional assumptions, rather than on\nany assumptions about linear or hierarchical organization per\nse. Given that some physical properties of a thing must first be\nrepresented in order for a person to become aware of that thing\u2019s\nsemantic properties, it is natural for the communications engineer to\nsuppose that no further representation of these physical properties\nneeds to be generated in order for that person to also be aware of\nthose properties, so that a person who is experiencing the semantic\nproperties of a stimulus must have been through a process that already\ngives them an experience of that stimulus\u2019s simple spatial\nproperties. This additional supposition would be a mistake, since the\nbrain represents the physical properties of stimuli in multiple,\nparallel, somewhat overlapping systems, only some of which put the\nsubject in a position to think about the properties that they\nrepresent. In order to get to a representation of the meaning of the\nword on a page, the subject\u2019s brain must represent that\nword\u2019s physical properties, but it turns out that the\nbrain\u2019s representation of these physical properties need not put\nthis perceiver in a position to form thoughts about them. Their access\nto these properties might require that the properties be represented\nall over again, in some parallel system. From the point of view\nintroduced by Broadbent \u2013 that of a communications engineer who\nis concerned with the management of limited capacity channels \u2013\nthis seems strangely profligate. At least some of the problems with\nthe early/late debate can be attributed to this: not an assumption\nabout linearity per se, but an assumption about the linearity\nof the processes that support personal level thinking.\n\nOnce the problematic assumption about linearity has been made precise,\nhowever, we see that it cannot be satisfactory to credit the entire\ncollapse of the early/late debate to this assumption. The falsity of\nthe assumption about the linearity of the processes supporting\npersonal-level awareness does not undermine the very idea that the\nearly/late debate is a meaningful one. The problems that it creates\nare largely methodological. The falsity of that assumption means that\none cannot make an inference from a lack of personal-level awareness\nof some content to the absence of representations encoding that\ncontent. It also means that Broadbent was wrong to suppose that the\npsychological effects of unattended stimuli can only depend on those\nproperties of which the inattentive perceiver can be aware. But these\nare methodological problems. They do not, by themselves, imply that\nthe debate between the early selection theory and the late selection\ntheory must have been misconceived.\n\nThe situation that we find ourselves in is, then, a somewhat unhappy\none. Everybody agrees that there was something misconceived about the\ndebate between the two theories of attention that dominated the\ndecades following Broadbent\u2019s reintroduction of attention to the\npsychological agenda. The ongoing influence of Broadbent\u2019s\nselection theory, and of the early/late debate, has often been noted,\nand sometimes lamented (Driver, 2001, 56). But nobody is clear about\nwhether the elements of those theories that are retained in current\ntheorizing are problematic ones.\n2.2 Feature Integration Theory\n\nIn the early nineteen eighties, Anne Treisman and her collaborators\nidentified the existence of \u2018the binding problem\u2019, and\ndescribed a process that could solve that problem. Treisman proposed\nthat attention be identified with this process. This proposal is known\nas the Feature Integration Theory of attention. It has been hugely\ninfluential, not only as a theory of attention, but also as the\nframework that introduced and regimented research into the\nindependently interesting question of the binding problem (for more on\nwhich, see\n \u2018The Unity of Consciousness\u2019\n esp.\n \u00a72.2).\n\nTreisman describes the way in which the binding problem arises like\nthis:\n\nSensory information arrives in parallel as a variety of heterogeneous\nhints, (shapes, colors, motions, smells and sounds) encoded in partly\nmodular systems. Typically many objects are present at once. The\nresult is an urgent case of what has been labelled the binding\nproblem. We must collect the hints, bind them into the right spatial\nand temporal bundles, and then interpret them to specify their real\nworld origins. (2003, 97)\n\n\nWe can illustrate this problem with an example. Suppose we have a\nsubject who is presented, at one time, with a red tomato and a green\napple. This visual input is, Treisman says, initially broken up for\nspecialized distributed processing\u2014so that, for example, one\npart of the brain is responsible for detecting the shapes of things, a\ndifferent part is responsible for detecting their colours. The\nshape-detecting centres represent the fact that a tomato-shaped thing\nis present, and they represent the fact that an apple-shaped thing is\npresent. The colour-detecting centres represent the fact that a red\nthing is present, and the fact that a green thing is present. But the\nsubject, if he is a normal human, knows more than is implied by these\nfour facts: He knows that the red thing is the tomato-shaped thing and\nthe green thing the apple-shaped thing. To know this he must have a\nway of \u2018binding\u2019 the representation of red in the colour\ncentre with the representation of the tomato shape in the shape\ncentre. The binding problem is the problem of knowing how to put\ntogether the properties that have been detected in separate\nspecialized detection centres.\n\nTreisman\u2019s proposed solution exploits the fact that\nspatial representations are ubiquitous, and the idea that\nthere is only one thing to be seen in any one place at any one time.\nIf the centre for detecting colours detects red at place one\nand green at place two, and if the centre for detecting shape\ndetects a tomato shape at place one and an apple shape at\nplace two, then, given the principle that there is a maximum of\none visible object per place per time, the binding problem can be\nsolved. Treisman therefore proposes that we achieve a correctly bound\nrepresentation by moving a variously sized \u2018window\u2019 from\none location in the perceptual scene to another. This window blocks\nout the information from all but a single location, and all the\nfeatures found at that location can then be \u2018bound\u2019 as\nbeing features of the same object. The area covered by the window\nwithin which features are bound is taken to correspond to the region\nto which attention is being paid.\n\nThere is more than one way to understand the explanatory import of\nTreisman\u2019s claim that the window of attention corresponds to the\nwindow within which features are bound. Treisman\u2019s early work\npresents that claim as an attempt to identify the processes of\nattention (by telling us that they are the processes of feature\nintegration). In her later work the explanation being offered is no\nlonger simply one in which it is attention that occupies the role of\nexplanandum and binding processes that occupy the role of explanans.\nHer later claim is that solving the binding problem is one role for\nthe kind of selectivity that attention enables.\n\nThere is some work in which the Feature Integration Theory has been\npressed into the service of more ambitious explanatory goals. That\ntheory plays an important role in John Campbell\u2019s 2002 attempt,\nin Reference and Consciousness, to use attention to explain\nhow the reference of demonstrative expressions gets fixed by their\nproducers, and understood by their consumers (see section\n 3.2).\n Treisman herself suggests, albeit tentatively, that descendants of\nthe Feature Integration Theory may provide part of the explanation for\n\u201cthe bound, unitary, interpreted, personal view of the world of\nsubjective experience\u201d (Treisman, 2003, 111). She goes on to\nsuggest, again tentatively, that the sort of explanation that such a\ntheory provides \u201cshould give us all the information there is\nabout the conditions that create consciousness\u201d (op\ncit).\n\nOpposed to those who think that a theory of feature binding will be a\nlarge component in our theory of attention, of the unity of\nconsciousness, or of anything else, are a number of philosophers (and\na smaller number of psychologists) who deny that feature binding\ncreates a problem that needs any serious cognitive apparatus for its\nsolution. Such claims have been made for a variety of reasons. They\nare generally made as part of large-scale revisionary proposals for\nthe conceptual framework of cognitive neuroscience. Kevin\nO\u2019Regan and Alva No\u00eb\u2019s rejection of the binding\nproblem \u2018as, in essence, a pseudo-problem\u2019 (O\u2019Regan\nand No\u00eb, 2001, 967) comes as part of their general attack on the\nidea that perception requires the representation of the thing\nperceived. Vincent Di Lollo has suggested that the assumptions about\nneural coding that generate the binding problem have been superseded,\nwith the result that the binding problem is an ill-defined one (Di\nLollo, 2012). And M.R. Bennett and P.M.S. Hacker, in their book-length\ncritique of the philosophical foundations of neuroscience, claim that\nthe notions of representation and information that enjoy currency in\nneuroscience are subject to various confusions, and that these\nconfusions lead to it being \u2018widespread\u2019 for\nneuroscientists to make \u201cconfused statements of the so-called\nbinding problem\u201d (Bennett and Hacker, 2003, 14). These debates\nabout the status of the binding problem (reviewed by Plate, 2007) turn\non foundational issues for the cognitive sciences generally. They have\nceased to be specifically concerned with the explanation of\nattention.\n\nEven if these philosophical critics of the binding problem are right\nto suggest that a perceiver can typically experience several\nproperties as belonging to a single object without the need for any\nspecial binding process to integrate the representations of those\nproperties, it may nonetheless be true that, in some particular cases,\nattention does play a role in determining the way in which different\nstreams of sensory information come to be combined. Even in these\ncircumscribed cases, the question of how this binding-like role for\nattention should be characterized may raise its own philosophical\ndifficulties. Several psychologists studying the integration of\ninformation from across different sensory modalities have found\nthemselves running into such difficulties, claiming that the role of\nattention in integrated multisensory perception is\n\u2018curious\u2019, and \u2018a paradox\u2019, especially in\ncases that involve the perception of speech (Tiippana, Andersen and\nSams, 2004; Macaluso et al., 2016). Philosophers who have\ninterrogated the assumptions leading to the idea there is a general\nbinding problem have not yet extended their critique to these more\nspecific cases. A preliminary philosophical examination suggests that\nthese may be cases in which the appearance of paradox derives from\ncertain questionable assumptions about the predominantly bottom-up\nnature of perceptual processing, or from assumptions of a more\nmetaphysical sort, concerning the localizable way in which\nattention\u2019s causal influence is exerted (Mole, 2020).\n2.3 Coherence Theories\n\nThe view that the function of attention is the management of\nlimitations in the brain\u2019s information processing capacity has\nbeen an orthodox one among psychologists since Donald Broadbent\nintroduced it in the nineteen fifties, but it has sometimes been\ncalled into question. The theories of attention proposed by\nphilosophers have tended not to endorse any straightforward version of\nthe capacity-limitation view, and there are empirical reasons to think\nthat the simplest versions of such a view are mistaken. In the\nnineteen seventies Ulric Neisser and his collaborators carried out a\nseries of experiments showing that, when appropriately trained, a\nsubject can perform two attention-involving tasks concurrently,\nwithout much interference between them (Hirst et al., 1980,\nNeisser, 1976). Neisser interpreted these experiments as suggesting\nthat, insofar as there is a bottleneck that attention is needed to\nmanage, it must often be a bottleneck in behavioural coordination,\nrather than in information processing capacity. Simple bodily\nlimitations are what prevent us from looking in two directions at one\ntime, or from throwing a ball and writing with the same hand.\nNeisser\u2019s suggestion was that in many cases cognitive processing\nwas selective, not as a result of limitations in processing capacity,\nbut only in so far as such bodily limitations required it to be.\n\nIn two papers from 1987, authored individually but published in the\nsame volume, Odmar Neumann and Alan Allport developed a similar idea.\nWhereas Neisser emphasized the constraints that are imposed on\ncognition by the need to manage a single body, Neumann and Allport\nboth emphasized the constraints that are placed on cognition by the\nneed to maintain a coherent course of goal-directed action. They\ndescribe their position as a \u2018selection-for-action\u2019\ntheory.\n\nIf we think of \u2018action\u2019 as here referring to bodily\nbehaviour then the selection-for-action theory is very similar to\nNeisser\u2019s view. But Neumann and Allport\u2019s point retains\nits force if we extend the notion of action to include deliberate\nmental activities, such as puzzle-solving, for which no bodily\nlimitations are in play. There is here an \u201canalogy between\npractical and theoretical and activity\u201d, which was noted in an\n1891 paper by G. F. Stout:\n\nThinking is action directed towards intellectual ends. Intellectual\nends are attained by an appropriate combination of movements of\nattention just as practical ends are attained by an appropriate\ncombination of movements of the body. If, therefore, we desire to\nexplain the process of Thinking, we must clearly determine the nature\nof active Attention. (Stout, 1891, p. 23)\n\n\nAs Stout and the later generations of action-oriented theorists\nindicate, the need to select among several possible sources of\ninformation, and to select among several possible things that might be\ndone with the information that has then been selected, is a\ncharacteristic of almost all deliberately executed thoughts and\nactions, whether those actions are bodily or intellectual. This\nubiquitous need for selectivity has been emphasized in a series of\nworks by Wayne Wu, where it is referred to as the \u201cmany many\nproblem\u201d(Wu, 2011a, 2014, 2019).\n\nIn Wu\u2019s handling of it, the idea that Neumann and Allport\nemphasized becomes part of a larger attempt to understand the\nessential connections between attention and agency (Wu, 2011b). For\nWu, attention\u2019s role in action is more fundamental than its role\nin perception. Stout is not the only precedent for this idea. The same\nconnection was noted by William James when he claimed that\n\u201cVolition is nothing but attention\u201d, (see Section\n 1.5,\n above). As with these earlier authors, Wu\u2019s point is not just\nthat, by treating attention as a purely perceptual phenomenon, we\nignore many of its other instances. Instead Wu wants to suggest that\nany division we might attempt to draw between perceptual attention and\nthe attentional selectivity required by agency would be an artificial\none. Even the involuntary capture of attention by perceptually salient\nstimuli should, Wu thinks, be understood as involving a kind of\nreadiness to act on the things to which we involuntarily attend\n(op cit, \u00a73). Wu\u2019s selection-for-action theory of\nattention is therefore intended as a step towards a unification of our\nphilosophical account of ourselves as agents and our philosophical\naccount of ourselves as perceivers.\n\nAccording to selection-for-action type views, the function of\nattention is not the management of capacity limitations. It is,\ninstead, the management of capacity excess. It is because we\ncan process multiple stimuli that we can be distracted by them, and\nbecause we can be distracted by them, not because we cannot process\nthem, that we need mechanisms of attention to provide selectivity and\nfocus. Attention, on this view, serves to lend coherence to, and to\nprevent interference between, the activity of several components in a\nsystem that has the capacity to handle far more stimuli than those\npertaining to the subject\u2019s current task. Such a view contrasts\nsharply with Broadbent\u2019s conception of attentional selectivity\nas capacity-bottleneck management.\n2.4 General-Purpose Prioritization\n\nIn the tradition perpetuated by Wu, the selectivity of attention is\nunderstood as providing a solution to one particular problem, created\nby the fact that there are multiple courses of action that might be\ntaken at any time, with the taking of any one requiring the others to\nbe suppressed. The solving of this particular problem is not the only\ncognitive need that could be served by an operation of selectivity,\neven in a mind without bottlenecks of processing capacity. The\nselection-for-action theory is therefore not the only alternative to\nBroadbent\u2019s bottleneck theory. Other functions for attentional\nselectivity might also be proposed. Alternatively\u2014rather than\nelecting any one of these functions of cognitive selectivity as being\nthe function that is essentially served by attention\u2014we might\ninstead characterize attention as a quite general process of\nselectivity, recruitable on any of the various occasions when one\nthing needs to prioritized over another, whether this prioritization\nis required by the presence of a processing bottleneck, required in\norder for a coherent action-plan to be executed, or required for some\nquite different reason. The work of Sebastian Watzl develops the idea\nthat attention might be such a non-specific process of prioritization\n(Watzl, 2017).\n\nIn Watzl\u2019s treatment of it, this idea places particular emphasis\non the fact that, just as a binary \u2018is greater than\u2019\nrelation can introduce a partial ordering on a set, so a number of\nthese binary prioritizations can be considered in sum, as introducing\na prioritization structure on the several items that together\nconstitute one\u2019s mental life. For Watzl, attention is the\nprocess by which one\u2019s life comes to have such a structure.\n\nWatzl also claims that any mind which lacked such a structure would\ntherefore be lacking a particular perspective on the world, and so\nwould not be the mind of a creature with the subjective point of view\nthat is characteristic of conscious experiences. From this he derives\nthe claim that every conscious creature is attentive. Carolyn Jennings\nhas suggested that certain kinds of highly engaged expert performance\nmay be a counterexample to this (Jennings, 2015).\n2.5 Precision Optimization Theories and Prediction Error Coding\n\nThe idea that there might be reasons for attentional selection that\nhave nothing to do with processing bottlenecks has also been a theme\nin the work of psychologists hoping to understand perception as a\nprocess of Bayesian inference (Friston et al. 2006,\nSummerfield & Egner, 2013), and in the work of those philosophers\nwho have been influenced by them (Hohwy, 2013; Clark, 2013, 2017).\n\nIn what has come to be the most philosophically developed version of\nthis Bayesian approach to the mind (Hohwy, 2013, Clark, 2013),\ncognition as a whole is understood to be a process of Bayesian\nupdating, in which a hierarchically-organized series of hypotheses is\nconstantly being tested, with each hypothesis being updated in the\nlight of evidence coming from the level below. Advocates of this\ntheory attempt to find room within this hierarchical framework for all\naspects of cognition, including perception, thought, and action. A\ncentral claim of their theory is that the information that gets passed\nup through this hierarchy is encoded in the form of signals\nrepresenting the errors in the predictions that have been\nmade by hypotheses at the hierarchy\u2019s next level up, with the\ncontent of one\u2019s experience at any time being given by whichever\nhypothesis makes the least erroneous predictions. (Different versions\nof the theory use different techniques to calculate the relative size\nof these prediction errors.) Given their commitment to\nprediction-error coding, a central claim of these theories is that the\nrole of our sensory encounter with the world is to provide information\nabout the way in which our prior hypotheses get things wrong: instead\nof providing us with the information that it has started to rain, our\nsenses provide only the information that it is more rainy than we had\nexpected.\n\nAdvocates of this theory claim that it \u201callows us to see\nattention in a new light and to provide alternative conceptualizations\nof its functional role in our overall mental economy\u201d (Hohwy,\n2014, p. 191). According to these \u2018alternative\nconceptions\u2019, attention adjusts the weighting of incoming\nprediction error signals, in accordance with their expected\nprecision (Hohwy, 2012). \u2018Precision\u2019 is to be\nunderstood here in the sense that contrasts precision with accuracy.\n\u2018Accuracy\u2019, in the intended sense, is a measure of the\ndifference between the value indicated by a signal and the actual\nvalue, whereas \u2018precision\u2019 is a measure of the random\nfluctuation in that signal, even when the actual input is held\nconstant. A miscalibrated instrument might, in this sense, be highly\nprecise, without being especially accurate.\n\nVarious empirical results make it plausible that the brain takes\naccount of expected precisions when it is processing perceptual\nsignals. In the ventriloquist illusion, for example, it is plausible\nthat expectations of precision have a role to play: It is because\nvision is expected to give a more precise indication of location than\naudition that sounds are heard to come from the location where their\nsource is apparently seen. Other considerations make it equally\nplausible that attention plays a role in accommodating the variations\nin these expected precisions, as we move from one context to another.\nIf we expect that the signal from vision is likely to be a noisy\none\u2014perhaps because a thick fog has started to\ndescend\u2014then we may place more weight than usual on the\ninformation that is present in the signal coming from audition. It\nseems likely that there is a role for attention in bringing about this\nchange of weighting. It is more controversial to claim, as the\nadvocates of this theory do, that \u201cattention is nothing but\nprecision optimization in hierarchical inference.\u201d (Hohwy, 1014,\np.244, citing Feldman & Friston, 2010). Ransom et al.\nhave suggested that, by taking attention always to be\nprecision optimization, this theory struggles to account for certain\nforms of voluntary attention (Ransom et al. 2017). Clark has\nsuggested that this challenge can be met if the sources of voluntary\nattention are identified with beliefs, rather than desires (Clark,\n2017).\n2.6 Competition Theories and Cognitive Unison\n\nLike the precision-optimization theories that have been advocated by\nHohwy and Clark, from within the framework of the prediction-error\ncoding theory, the Coherence theories advocated by Neisser, Neumann,\nAllport, and Wu have also suggested functions for attention other than\nthe management of limitations in processing capacity. Despite the\navailability of these non-Broadbentian conceptions of\nattention\u2019s function, the Broadbentian idea that\nattention\u2019s selectivity serves to manage limitations in\nprocessing capacity continues to be regarded by many psychologists as\nincontrovertible. The claim that \u201cBecause the visual system does\nnot have the capacity to process all inputs simultaneously, there must\nexist attentional processes that help the visual system select some\ninputs\u201d continues to be treated as a platitude of the sort that\ncan be used as an uncontroversial opening sentence when introducing\none\u2019s research. (The example just given comes from the beginning\nof Vecera (2000), but many more examples of the same claim can easily\nbe found.)\n\nFor those who reject this platitude, and think that the\nfunction of attention is something other than the management\nof limitations in processing capacity, it is natural to think that the\nmechanisms of attentional selection may be something other\nthan capacity bottlenecks.\n\nThe clearest non-bottleneck mechanisms for achieving selectivity are\ncompetitions. Since well-organized competitions can always\nselect one winner, however good and however numerous the competitors,\nthe selectivity of a competitive mechanism need not have anything to\ndo with bottlenecks, or with any other limitations of processing\ncapacity.\n\nCompetition-based mechanisms for achieving selectivity come in at\nleast two varieties: In a simple race mechanism each of the\ncompetitors independently completes a process that is comparable,\nalong some dimension of variation, with the processes that are\ncompleted by each of the other competitors. The competitor that\nachieves the highest value on the relevant dimension of variation is\nselected as the winner. In a struggle the competitors do not\njust get on with their own processing in the hope that they will do it\nbetter than each of the other competitors. Instead the active\nsuppression of other competitors is a part of the process that each\ncompetitor carries out. Simple race models of attention have been\nproposed (Shibuya and Bundesen, 1988, Bundesen, 1987), but our best\ncurrent theories supplement the simple race mechanism with some\ncomponents of mutual struggle, or with additional processes of\ntop-down control (see, for example, Bundesen and Habekost, 2008).\n\nOne suggestion for a supplemented-competition mechanism for\nattentional selectivity is the biased-competition model, elaborated in\nseveral works by Robert Desimone, John Duncan and John Reynolds. The\nbiased-competition model accounts for various attention-involving\neffects, at the personal and at the sub-personal level, as being\neffects that arise from numerous struggles between the different\nstimuli that fall within the variously sized receptive fields of\nneurons throughout the perceptual processing hierarchy. It is\nhypothesized that each one of these struggles is biased, although not\nsettled outright, by a top-down attention-specific signal (Desimone\nand Duncan, 1995, Reynolds and Desimone, 2001).\n\nWe have said that competitions are selective in ways that do not\ninvolve limitations in capacity, and that competition-based theories\nof attention\u2019s underlying mechanisms are therefore natural\naccompaniments to selection-for-action type views of attention\u2019s\nfunction (Section\n 2.3),\n and perhaps to other views that involve a break from the Broadbentian\nview according to which attention\u2019s function is the management of\ncapacity limitations. Competition views of attention\u2019s\nmechanisms do not, however, require us to take a non-Broadbentian view\nof attention\u2019s function. Although the biased competition view\nsits naturally with a non-Broadbentian view of that function, Reynolds\nand Desimone continue to introduce the biased competition theory as an\nattempt to understand attention in recognizably Broadbentian terms,\nwriting that:\n\nThe visual system is limited in its capacity to process information.\nHowever, it is equipped to overcome this constraint because it can\ndirect this limited capacity channel to locations or objects of\ninterest. (2001, 233)\n\n\nSome advocates of the biased competition view emphasize the particular\nimportance of the top-down biasing signals that the theory postulates\n(e.g., Beck and Kastner, 2009, p. 1156), taking the source of\nthese signals to be the true locus of attentional selection. Others\nsuggest that the biased competition theory is better understood as a\ntheory that refuses to identify any such locus, and that it should\ninstead be read (as suggested in Duncan\u2019s original presentation\nof the theory, (Duncan 1996)) as attributing the selectivity of\nattention to the totality of an integrated competition, involving\nprocesses of various sorts at various levels, any part of which can\nbias any other (Mole, 2011, \u00a76.7, 2015).\n\nWhen it is understood in this second way the biased-competition theory\naccords with the proposal that attention should be taken to have a\nmetaphysical status analogous to that of unison in an orchestra.\nAccording to this view it is always a mistake to identify any one\nprocess as the attention process (or any set of processes as the\nattention processes); attention requires the unified activity of\nwhichever processes happen to be relevant to a person\u2019s current\ntask, but, since these vary from one task to the next, it does not\nrequire any particular processes to be taking place. Such a\nview has been developed in work by Christopher Mole, who dubs it the\n\u2018Cognitive Unison Theory\u2019. Metaphysically speaking, such a\ntheory can be understood as a revival of John Locke and F.H.\nBradley\u2019s view that attention is a mode of thinking (see\n Section 1.3\n above). Phenomenologically the view has a precedent in Ribot\u2019s\nsuggestion that attention be identified with \u2018monoideism\u2019\n(Ribot, 1889, p. 10). It also draws on some ideas about the\n\u2018polymorphousness\u2019 of attention, which were advocated in a\n1964 monograph by Alan White, on the basis of considerations drawn\nfrom the examination of various \u2018heed concepts\u2019 in natural\nlanguage.\n\nBecause operating in unison requires an absence of task-irrelevant\nprocessing, the most straightforward version of the unison theory\nentails that full attention is a rare achievement, with most cases of\nattentiveness involving what is, strictly speaking, only partial or\ndivided attention. Mole (like Ribot) accepts this implication. Yair\nLevy has suggested that doing so prevents him from giving an adequate\naccount of phenomena such a listening, or observing, which always\nrequire some attention to be paid, but which can nonetheless be done\nmore or less attentively (Levy, 2019). Work by Philipp Koralus has\nsuggested that a more satisfactory treatment of divided attention can\nbe given if the attentive pursuit of a task is understood to share\ncertain formal properties with the answering of a question (Koralus,\n2014). This characterization of attention as \u201cthe means by which\nwe answer questions about the environment\u201d has been argued for\non phenomenological and epistemological grounds by Naomi Eilan (Eilan,\n1998). (Eilan credits the thought to Rowland Stout, whose treatment of\nit can be found in Chapter 9 \u00a75 of Stout 2006.) Koralus draws on\nHamblin\u2019s 1958 semantics of questions to provide a formal model\nof such questioning (Hamblin, 1958).\n\nThere are philosophical issues, independent of the cognitive unison\ntheory, about the way in which partial or divided attention relates to\nfull attention, and about whether a distinction should be drawn\nbetween the attention that is given to things by which we are merely\ndistracted and the attention that is given to things on which we\nremain concertedly focused. Aaron Henry considers these questions as\npart of a more general enquiry into attention and control, using the\nnotion of constitutive norms to provide an account in which\ndistraction always does involve a certain sort of shortcoming, while\nnonetheless qualifying as a case of genuine attention, rather than\nmerely being a defective approximation of it (Henry, 2019). Zachary\nIrving has suggested that the wandering of a distracted mind presents\nphilosophical puzzles of its own, and has worked towards giving an\nempirically-informed account of mind-wandering that avoids these\npuzzles. His account takes such wandering to be attentive but unguided\n(Irving, 2016). Theories such as the Cognitive Unison Theory, in which\nattention essentially depends on the performance of an\nunderstanding-guided task, will need to find some alternative account\nof the phenomena that Irving identifies.\n2.7 Spotlight Theories\n\nWhereas bottleneck metaphors have traditionally guided the\ntheories that attempt to locate the cognitive resources that operate\nonly on attended stimuli, it has been spotlight metaphors\nthat have guided the theories that attempt to say which features of a\nstimulus determine whether attention is being paid to that stimulus at\nany given moment (e.g., Watchel, 1967; Woodman and Luck, 1999; see\nFernandez-Duque and Johnson, 2002, for discussion). The idea suggested\nby the spotlight metaphor is that a stimulus\u2019s location\nultimately determines whether or not that stimulus receives attention:\nthe point here is not to deny that one can pay attention to something\non account of it being brightly coloured, or on account of it being\ninteresting. The point is, instead, that one pays attention to\nbrightly coloured or interesting things only by directing one\u2019s\nattention to the location of those things.\n\nOne can easily see why the spotlight metaphor has been appealing. If\nwe are presented with an array of differently coloured shapes,\nappearing and disappearing in various places, then there will be any\nnumber of attention-demanding tasks that we might perform regarding\nthat array. Some tasks might require us to attend to whatever is going\non at the top of the screen, others might require us to attend to all\nthe red shapes, or to all the triangles, or to something else. Some of\nthese ways of attending seem to be more basic than others. It seems,\nfor example, that attending to things in the top part of the screen\nmight be a primitive task, whereas attending to the triangles could\nnot be primitive in the same way: we cannot simply attend to\nthe triangles. If we want to attend to the triangles, we need first to\nwork out where the triangles are. If, on the other hand, we\nwant to attend to the things in the top part of the screen we do not\nneed to work out whether they are triangles. It is therefore plausible\nthat when we attend to the triangles we do so by attending to\ntheir locations. In this sense attending on the basis of location\nseems to be more basic than attending on the basis of shape.\n\nThe idea that attending to a location is more basic than attending to\na shape might tempt one to think that attending on the basis of\nlocation is absolutely basic, so that attention is always and only\nallocated on the basis of location. If that were right then a theory\nof the spatial allocation of attention\u2014a theory about the moving\nand focusing of an \u2018attentional spotlight\u2019\u2014would be\na large and central component in an account of how attention works.\nThis would be good news for those who want to give a single unified\ntheory of attention, and it would be good news for the scientific\nproject of explaining attention more generally, since\nattention\u2019s spotlight-like behaviours are some of its best\nunderstood aspects (see Logan, 1996).\n\nThere are reasons to think that location does play a special role in\nthe allocation of attention, as the spotlight metaphor suggests. But\nthe role of location in the allocation of attention is probably not as\nstraightforward as would be required by the most parsimonious of\nspotlight-based theories. Location does have a special role to play\nhere, but (1) location is not the only property to have such a role,\nand (2) the role of location is more complicated than a simple\nspotlight metaphor suggests.\n\nEmpirical debates about the direction of the spotlight of attention\nhave focussed mostly on the second of these points. An important\nsource of data here is case studies contrasting the different patterns\nof attention failure that are shown by different unilateral neglect\npatients. Such studies suggest that various frames of reference are\ninvolved in the spatial allocation of attention (Behrmann and Tipper,\n1999). This indicates that there is no single map of\nlocations determining which items get attention: attention is\nsometimes allocated on the basis of location in egocentric space,\nsometimes on the basis of location in more complex frames of reference\n(a point that was among those raised by Allport, in his influential\ncritique of the Broadbentian debates (see Allport, 1992, p. 197)).\n\nThere are also some well-known experimental effects suggesting that\nattention is allocated, not on the basis of straightforward spatial\ncoordinates, but in ways that are constrained by the distribution of\nobjects in space. The classic work in this area is John\nDuncan\u2019s demonstration that attention shifts more readily\nbetween two locations that fall within the bounds of a single object\nthan between equidistant locations that are separated by an object\nboundary (Duncan, 1984). Equally important here are findings from\nexperiments using three-dimensional stimuli, and using virtual\nthree-dimensional displays. These studies suggest that experimental\nparticipants are unable to differentially attend to depths in an empty\nspace, but that these participants start to be able to shift their\nattention forwards and backward (to a place in front of or behind the\npoint that their eyes are fixating) when the relevant locations are\nones in which there are objects (see Yantis, 1998).\n\nThese converging sources of data indicate that the spotlight of\nattention is not allocated simply on the basis of coordinates in any\nsingle spatial frame of reference. That is an important finding for\nthose attempting to localize mechanisms for the allocation of\nattention within the brain (since different brain areas differ in\ntheir mapping of space, and in their representation of spatial\ninformation about the objects within it). It has been influential in\nleading psychologists to turn away from simple spotlight metaphors. It\nshould be noted, however, that these findings do not threaten the core\nof the idea that was suggested by the spotlight metaphor: the facts\nabout what a person is attending to might still supervene on the facts\nabout where that person is attending, even if quite numerous\nand sometimes complex factors are responsible for determining which\nlocation that is.\n\nOther effects are somewhat more damaging for a pure spotlight view,\nalthough they also stop short of refuting it entirely. The\nmore-than-merely-spatial complexity of the way in which attention is\nallocated has been nicely demonstrated in a series of experiments by\nDwight Kravitz and Marlene Behrmann (Kravitz and Behrmann, 2011). The\nparticipants in these experiments have their attention cued by a brief\nstimulus that is presented at one end of a shape that is shown on a\ncomputer screen. This shape might be a simple rectangle, a rectangle\nwith bulbous ends, or a more complex \u2018H\u2019 or\n\u2018h\u2019 shape. It is presented alongside another shape, which\nin some cases has the same shape and colour, and in other cases is\ndifferent. The resulting allocation of attention is then probed by\nmeasuring the reaction times to stimuli that are presented on and near\nthese objects. Kravitz and Behrmann find that all the different\nproperties of their stimuli interact to determine the way in\nwhich attention is allocated to the screen on which those stimuli\nappear. Most strikingly of all, they find a difference in the\nallocation of attention between trials in which the shapes on the\nscreen are an upper and a lower case \u2018H\u2019, and trials in\nwhich the shapes are an upper case H and number 4, even though this\nnumber 4 shape is exactly the same as the lower case h, but presented\nupside down. Such findings suggest that attention, even when triggered\nby a simple spatial cue, is not allocated merely on the basis of\nlocation, but also on the basis of shape, colour, and arbitrary\nlearned meaning.\n\nThe discovery that attention can preferentially modulate the\nprocessing of stimuli on account of their colours, shapes, and\nmeanings does not prevent us from maintaining that the location of a\nstimulus has a special role to play in the process by which attention\nis allocated to it. More than one line of research in psychology has\nsought to identify some one representation in the brain in which items\nare encoded in a way that determines the extent to which attention\nwill be allocated to them. In the longest established of these lines\nof research\u2014beginning with the work of Koch and Ullman\n(1985)\u2014this representation has been taken to be a map,\nin some quite literal sense of \u2018map\u2019: the representation\nis taken to be one in which every location in some region is\nrepresented, and the representation of these locations is taken to be\nin some format that immediately encodes the spatial relations between\nthem. Every object that is represented is taken to be represented as\nbeing at some location, and the properties assigned to these located\nobjects are taken to determine the likelihood that attention will be\npaid to the location that the objects occupy. According to the theory\nthat postulates these \u2018salience maps\u2019, location does play\na unique role in determining the way in which attention is allocated,\ndespite the fact that other properties also contribute to that\nallocation.\n\nIn more recent treatments of this idea (Pessoa, 2013) such maps are\ntaken to include representations, not merely of the objective\nproperties that give an item salience, but also of subjective\nproperties, such as emotional-valence and\ncurrent-motivational-relevance. The more we think of these maps as\nbeing augmented with additional, non-spatial information, the less\nspotlight-like the allocation of attention represented in them will\nseem to be, but, provided the representation in question is still\nunderstood to be map-like, location can still be understood to have an\nimportant role, and perhaps even a uniquely important one.\n\nDebates about the role of such maps, and about the variety of\nsubjective and objective properties that are represented within them,\nmay have some wide-ranging philosophical consequences, concerning more\nthan just the aptness of the spotlight metaphor. Aaron Henry has\nsuggested that the viability of some recent philosophical theories\ndepends on the outcome of these debates. Since the recent\nphilosophical theories of attention have tended to emphasize the role\nof agency in attention, they face potential counterexamples from\ninstances of involuntary attention. Henry suggests that the threat of\nsuch counterexamples can be defused if the mechanisms of involuntary\nattention capture are understood to involve attention being allocated\non the basis of a map in which the agent\u2019s own priorities for\naction are represented (Henry, 2017).\n\nAlthough the psychological debates about salience maps are ongoing, an\nargument against pure spotlight views can also be made on more\ntraditional, phenomenological grounds. A pure spotlight theory,\naccording to which attention is always allocated on the basis of\nlocation, seems unable to account for the sort of case that Hermann\nvon Helmholtz and William James were concerned with (see section\n 1.5).\n There is, as their example suggests, a difference between attending\nto the pitch of a note and attending to its timbre, or to its\novertones. This difference in attention does not seem to correspond to\nany difference in the location attended. Nor does any purely\nlocation-based theory of attention allocation seem able to account for\nthe sort attention that one must pay in order to perform a time-based\ntask, such as finding out which of a group of shapes appears on screen\nfor longest. Such temporal aspects of attention have been a relatively\nlate addition to the psychological research agenda (see the papers\ncollected in Nobre and Coull, 2010). The research concerning them is\nbeginning to reveal a diverse range of effects, with a range of\nsimilarly diverse neural underpinnings (Nobre and van Ede, 2018). Some\nphilosophical work has been devoted to the exploration of these\ntemporal aspects of attention (see Phillips, 2011), but it is work\nthat has tended to address questions that further our understanding of\nthe experience and perception of time, without attempting to\ncontribute directly to our philosophical understanding of attention\nitself (see the entry on\n The Experience and Perception of Time).\n\nSince some shifts of attention are not shifts in the location\nattended, a theory of the factors that determine which locations a\nsubject is attending to cannot tell us the whole story about the\nallocation of attention. It might nonetheless be a central component\nin a theory of some of attention\u2019s forms (see Wright and Ward,\n2008).\n2.8 Motor Theories\n\nWork in which electrodes are used in vivo to stimulate areas\nof the macaque brain known to be associated with eye-movement\ncoordination has provided strong evidence for the existence of an\nanatomical overlap between brain areas involved in eye-movement\ncontrol and those involved in determining which stimuli elicit the\nstrongest responses in visual cortex. There is also evidence that this\nanatomical fact has some functional significance. One suggestive\nfinding is that the links between frontal eye-movement-control areas\nand attention-like effects in occipital visual areas are spatially\nspecific: an electrode that is placed so that it elicits an eye\nmovement to a particular part of the visual field when activated at\none level will, if activated at a lower level, elicit changes in\nneural responsiveness that are exactly similar to the changes that are\nseen when attention is shifted to that same location (Moore and\nArmstrong, 2003, Armstrong and Moore, 2007).\n\nThese facts have been taken to be suggestive of a \u2018motor\ntheory\u2019 of attention, according to which the processes\nunderpinning attention are, in at least some cases, truncated versions\nof the processes underpinning the coordination of movements of sensory\norientation.\n\nThe central idea of such a theory is that \u201cthe program for\norienting attention either overtly or covertly is the same, but in the\nlatter case the eyes are blocked at a certain peripheral stage\u201d\n(Rizzolatti et al, 1987, 37). Advocates of motor theories\n(such as Moore, Armstrong and Fallah, 2003) have characterised their\nwork as a revival of the picture that Alexander Bain proposed at the\nend of the nineteenth century. Bain (as we saw in Section\n 1.5,\n above) identified attention with truncated versions of the\nmotor-control processes that typically bring about attention\u2019s\nbehavioural manifestations \u2014 processes \u201cstopping short of\nthe actual movement performed by the organ\u201d (Bain, 1888,\n371).\n\nThese versions of the motor theory should be distinguished from\ntheories that regard attention and motor control as intimately linked,\nbut that place no emphasis on the fact that the motor control\nprocesses that have been implicated in attention are processes that\ncontrol the movement of sensory organs. In these theories\n(which are natural but not obligatory concomitants of the\n\u2018selection-for-action\u2019 views discussed in\n section 2.5)\n attention stands in an intimate relation to motor control more\ngenerally. One line of experimental evidence in support of such a\ngeneral connection comes from work by Heiner Deubel and his\ncollaborators, in which various changes to the way in which an object\nfigures in action are shown to have an attention-indicating influence\non the perceptual discrimination of stimuli that are presented on or\nnear that object. In one striking example of this, Deubel and\nSchneider found that the way in which attention is allocated to the\nspace around a 6.5cm wooden X shape depended on whether the subject\nwas reaching with her left hand to grasp the shape by the top-left and\nbottom right arms, or reaching with her right hand to grasp the shape\nby the arms at its top-right and bottom left (Deubel & Schneider,\n2004). In each case attention was allocated not only to the shape, but\nto the to-be-gripped parts of it. (For other evidence of interactions\nbetween attention and action-targeting, see Tipper, Howard, and\nHoughton, 1998.)\n\nMotor theories and other action-based theories give a plausible\naccount of some of attention\u2019s instances, but they have\nlimitations that prevent them from applying with full generality:\nSince movement of the eyes, or of the limbs, is always movement to\na location motor theories will struggle to account for the\nallocation of attention on the basis of anything other than location.\nThey therefore face the limitations that we saw when considering pure\nspotlight theories, of being unable to account for shifts in attention\nthat do not correspond to differences in the location attended. Nor is\nit clear how motor theories should be applied to spatial attention in\nthose sensory modalities where the orientation of the sense organs is\nless straightforward than it is in the visual case. The motor theory\ndoes, nonetheless, provide a plausible and well-supported account of\nthe location-based variety of visual attention that is displayed in\ntypical attention-lab experiments.\n\nThe success of motor theories in accounting for the sorts of attention\nthat are found in some typical attention-lab experiments can be given\neither an optimistic or a pessimistic interpretation. The optimistic\ninterpretation sees the motor theory as providing a successful account\nof the processing underpinning some of attention\u2019s simpler and\nmore central varieties. The pessimistic interpretation sees the motor\ntheory as revealing a problem with our usual experimental\nparadigms.\u00a0 The participants in typical laboratory tasks direct\ntheir attention to different parts of their visual field, while\nkeeping their eyes fixated on a central spot. The behavioural\nsignatures of attention in such tasks are usually reductions in\nreaction time to the attended stimuli. The neural correlates of these\nbehavioural signatures are certain biases as to which stimuli most\nstrongly drive the neural circuitry that processes them. The central\nfinding of the motor-theorists is that these neural and behavioural\neffects can result from attenuated versions of the activity\nresponsible for directing eye movements. The pessimistic\ninterpretation of this finding is as revealing that signs that have\ntraditionally been taken to indicate the direction of attention are\nactually no more than consequences of the truncated eye-movements that\nour experimental paradigms induce, by imposing the restriction that\nexperimental participants fixate their gaze on a single location. If\nthat is right then the phenomenon studied in attention labs may not be\nthe psychologically important one that it has been taken for.\n\nMotor theorists are not the only ones who might be accused of\nelevating a theory of some circumscribed subset of attention-related\nphenomena into a spuriously general theory of attention in its\nentirety. Henry Taylor has shown that, although the ambition to give a\ngeneral theory of attention is widespread among the philosophers who\nhave recently written on this subject, it is seldom found in the\nrecent psychological literature, where it has proven fruitful to\nfollow the influential example of Michael Posner by giving somewhat\nseparate treatments of attention\u2019s roles in vigilance, in\nperceptual orientation, and in the focalized deployment of processing\nresources (Taylor, 2015, 2018; Posner and Boies, 1971). Taylor\nsuggests that the psychologists\u2019 tolerance for pluralism here\nshould be reflected in our philosophical theories.\n3. Explanatory Roles for Attention\n3.1 Attention and Consciousness\n3.1.1 Is Attention Necessary for Consciousness?\n\nThe question of whether attention is necessary for consciousness has\nbeen answered in various ways. One answer is given by those who think\nthat lots of unattended items appear in consciousness. A different\nanswer is given by those who think that only some unattended items\nfigure in consciousness. A third answer is given if we think that\nunattended items figure in consciousness only in special\ncircumstances. There is some evidence that, independently of any\nphilosophical commitments, people differ as to which of these views\nthey find plausible (Schwitzgebel, 2007). There are also some theories\n(e.g., Watzl, 2017) in which attention is necessary for\n\u2018creature consciousness\u2019 in the sense that every conscious\ncreature must be an attentive one. Such views need not entail that\nattention to an object is necessary for the conscious perception of\nthat object.\n\nAt one extreme end of this spectrum is the view according to which\nattention to a thing is strictly necessary for consciousness of it, so\nthat the things to which we are not paying attention do not figure in\nour consciousness at all. A number of psychologists endorse this view\n(e.g., Cohen et al. 2012), as do some philosophers (e.g.,\nPrinz, 2012, Carruthers, 2015, Montemayor & Haladjian, 2015). It\nhas historical precedent in James\u2019s remark, at the beginning of\nhis chapter on attention, that \u201cmy experience is what I agree to\nattend to\u201d(James, 1890, ch. 11), and in Kames\u2019 remark that\n\u201cAttention is requisite even to the simple act of seeing\u201d\n(Kames, 1769, see Sect\n 1.4,\n above).\n\nThe evidence that is proffered in support of the view that attention\nis strictly necessary for consciousness comes from a range of\nexperiments showing the surprising extent to which experimental\nparticipants are ignorant of the items to which they have paid no\nattention. In Arien Mack and Irvin Rock\u2019s \u2018inattentional\nblindness\u2019 paradigm, for example, participants who are given an\nattention-demanding task pertaining to a stimulus in one part of their\nvisual field frequently fail to notice shapes or words that are\nflashed up elsewhere (Mack & Rock, 1998). In Rensink et\nal.\u2019s \u2018change blindness\u2019 paradigm the\nparticipants need to see an alternating pair of pictures between ten\nand twenty times before they can identify a large but narratively\ninconsequential difference between them (Rensink et al.,\n1997, Rensink, 2002). In the most memorable of these experiments a\nlarge number of participants fail to notice the central appearance of\na man in a gorilla suit when their attention is taken up with the\nbusiness of counting the number of passes made by one of two teams in\na concurrent basketball-type game (Simons & Chabdris, 1999).\n\nNo single one of these experiments can establish the claim that\nattention is always necessary for consciousness. That claim is a\nuniversally quantified one, and is not entailed by any one of its\ninstances. Nor is it clear that what we see in these experiments\nreally are instances in which unattended objects drop out of\nconsciousness altogether. The participants\u2019 ignorance of the\ngorilla\u2019s appearance, for example, is compatible with it being\nthe case that the presence of the gorilla does make a\nphenomenal difference to their inattentive experience. To explain\nthose participants\u2019 ignorance we need only say that any\nphenomenal difference that the unattended gorilla makes is a\ndifference that the participants are unable to use in answering the\nexperimenter\u2019s question about whether anything strange happened\nin the scene. It may be a phenomenal difference that is epistemically\nunusable because it is immediately forgotten (see Wolfe, 1998) or it\nmay, alternatively, be a difference that is unusable because it is too\nunstructured and inchoate to be epistemically mobilizable. In that\ncase the effect of inattention would be inattentional\nagnosia, rather than inattentional blindness (see\nSimons, 2000).\n\nAbsolute amnesia for unattended items, or thoroughgoing agnosia for\nthem, may be indistinguishable from inattentional blindness, both\nbehaviourally and from the point of view of retrospective\nintrospection. For that reason it is not a straightforward matter for\nthe advocates of any of these interpretations of the inattentional\nblindness and change blindness effects to rule out the alternative\ninterpretations. Subpersonal sources of data (such as experiments\nusing neuroimaging) may be the only sources of data that we have to go\non. (See Rees, et al. 1999, for an example in which fMRI data\nis used to argue against the amnesia interpretation of inattentional\nblindness effects involving written words).\n\nIt is only narratively insignificant differences that go unnoticed in\nthe change-blindness paradigm. Change blindness effects might\ntherefore be taken as showing, not that there is no consciousness in\nthe absence of attention, but that there is consciousness in\nthe absence of attention, the contents of which are restricted to the\nscene\u2019s overall gist. There are difficulties in adjudicating\nbetween these two interpretations experimentally. When features of\ngist do seem to be perceived, in the apparent absence of attention,\nthe defender of the claim that attention is necessary for\nconsciousness may reply by claiming that attention has been paid to\nthese items, either in a dispersed, non-focal way (Prettyman, 2013),\nor because these features are briefly and involuntarily\nattention-catching (Prinz, 2012, p. 119). Without an experimental\noperationalization of complete inattention, these rival\ninterpretations cannot be ruled out, with the result that empirical\ndebates about the extent of consciousness beyond attention are\ncurrently in something of deadlock, with experimenters being able to\nclaim only to have demonstrated perception in the \u2018near\nabsence\u2019 of attention (Li et al., 2002, Reddy et\nal., 2004, Reddy et al., 2006), and so providing only\ninconclusive support to the hypothesis that attention and\nconsciousness are dissociable (Koch & Tsuchiya, 2007).\n\nThe methodological puzzle that we face when trying to settle the\ndispute between different interpretations of the inattentional and\nchange blindness effects raises the question of whether our\ncommonsense beliefs about the conscious status of unattended items are\nwell founded. Such beliefs seem to vary from person to person\n(Schwitzgebel, 2007), and to vary with certain features of the context\nin which they are probed (De Brigard, 2010). To the extent that we\nfind it natural to suppose that unattended items do figure in\nconsciousness, this may simply be owing to a version of the\n\u2018refrigerator-light illusion\u2019: If our reason for believing\nthat we are conscious of the things to which we pay no attention is a\nreason that depends on our finding that we are conscious of those\nthings whenever we check on them then that belief is on shaky ground.\nA checking procedure cannot provide us with good evidence about the\nstatus of unattended items since the act of checking is itself an act\nthat involves a shift in attention to the things checked\n(O\u2019Regan & No\u00eb, 2001).\n\nSince a direct checking procedure is ruled out we need a more\ntheory-driven way of assessing the dispute between those who claim\nthat the consequence of not attending to an item is that the item\ndrops out of conscious experience and those who claim that inattention\nsimply puts the subject in a poor epistemic position vis-\u00e0-vis\nthese unattended items. The current state of our theories is such that\nit would be premature to try to settle this dispute by an inference to\nthe best explanation, since neither side of the dispute has a theory\nof the attention/consciousness relation that has been worked out to a\ndegree that would allow the different explanations to be compared. We\ncan, however, see some of the considerations that the two sides in\nthis debate might invoke. Those who endorse the idea that attention is\nnecessary for consciousness can point to the fact that this view\naccords well with theories in which attention features prominently in\nthe explanation of consciousness (e.g., Prinz, 2005, 2012). They may\nalso be able to develop arguments based on theories of the way in\nwhich consciousness and attention evolved (Montemayor & Haladjian,\n2015). Those who prefer the epistemic-deficit interpretation of the\ninattentional blindness effects (Mole, 2011, \u00a77.3.7) can point to\nthe fact that that interpretation flows naturally from the view\naccording to which attention to an item provides the sort of\nacquaintance that is needed for the use of a demonstrative concept\nthat refers to that item (a view advocated by Campbell, 2002, and\ndiscussed in section\n 3.2\n below): If attention to the gorilla is necessary for the forming of a\ndemonstrative-involving thought (such as \u2018That\u2019s a\ngorilla\u2019) then there is an immediate explanation, consistent\nwith the idea that unattended items nonetheless feature in\nconsciousness, for the fact that inattentive people are unable to\nanswer questions such as \u2018Was there a gorilla?\u2019.\n\nThe difficulty in the case of the unnoticed gorilla is to discern\nwhether unattended items are present to consciousness but present only\nas unindividuated items to which no demonstrative reference has yet\nbeen directed, or whether those unattended items are instead absent\nfrom consciousness altogether. Part of this difficulty originates in\nthe fact that, although most people give no attention to the gorilla,\nthey could attend to him, and would have done so if anything\nhad prompted them to do so. More data may be available, both to\nintrospection and to laboratory measurement, in cases where our\nfailure to attend has some more systemic explanation. Ned Block has\nsuggested that one such case is found in our perception of peripheral\nstimuli, when these are subject to the phenomenon of \u2018identity\ncrowding\u2019 (Block, 2013a). An individual \u2018T\u2019 or\n\u2018F\u2019 can be seen reasonably clearly, even when presented in\na peripheral part of the visual field. But if additional characters\nare presented alongside this individual character, then the properties\nof those characters become prone to perceptual confusion. Attention\nseems to bind together properties from all of the characters in the\nvicinity of the one individual that we are trying to pick out. It\ntherefore seems that, in the perceptual periphery, attention cannot be\ndirected onto a region that fits an individual character tightly. Due\nto this \u2018crowding\u2019 effect, individual letters or shapes\nbecome impossible to individuate from the others with which they are\nclustered, when they fall into parts of the visual field that are\noutside of the high-definition centre. The properties of objects that\nare crowded in this way can nonetheless be seen, and the fact that\nseveral items are present can be reliably reported. On the basis of\nempirical and introspective considerations, Block claims that, even in\ncases where the crowded characters share all of their features with\nthe others by which they are crowded, these crowded characters are\nconsciously discriminated from their surroundings. He claims that\nthese characters figure as objects in consciousness. Since attention\ncannot be allocated to anything more fine-grained than the crowd of\nwhich these characters are a part, the characters are not themselves\nobjects to which attention is paid. Block therefore takes\n\u2018identity crowding\u2019 to give counterexamples to the claim\nthat we are conscious of objects only when paying attention to\nthem.\n\nBlock\u2019s claim that the crowded characters figure in\nconsciousness as individuated objects, rather than as parts of some\nfeature-rich texture, has been contested (Taylor, 2013, Richards,\n2013). In response, Block has suggested that an inference the best\nexplanation of several related phenomena favours his interpretation of\nthe effect (Block, 2013b).\n\nInference to the best explanation is always a hazardous business,\nespecially in the vicinity of an explanatory gap. In the\ninterpretation of identity crowding, as in the interpretation of\ninattentional blindness, the inescapability of abductive\nconsiderations suggests that our answer to the question of whether\nattention is necessary for consciousness may have to wait until we\nhave a better understanding of the relation of attention to\ndemonstrative reference (of the sort that is involved in thinking\n\u2018That\u2019s a gorilla\u2019), and perhaps until we have a\nbetter understanding of attention\u2019s role in epistemology more\ngenerally. (See\n sections 3.3 & 3.4 ,\n below.)\n3.1.2 Is Attention Sufficient for Consciousness?\n\nIn addition to disputes about whether we are conscious of\nonly those things to which we attend, there are also disputes\nabout whether we are conscious of everything to which we\nattend. If we were then a complete theory of attention might be given\nby giving an account of the way in which attention modulates\nconsciousness.\n\nDeclan Smithies has argued in favour of a position according to which\neverything that is attended to is consciously attended to. He claims\nthat all instances of attention must be consciousness-involving, on\nthe grounds that (1) all such instances must have a connection with\ntheir subject\u2019s \u2018rational-access\u2019 to the contents of\nher experience, and (2) there is no connection to rationality in the\ncase of processing that is wholly unconscious. Smithies\u2019 view\nis, therefore, that attention is essentially involved in the\n\u2018rational-access\u2019 of consciously experienced contents\n(Smithies, 2011). The nature of any such connection between attention\nto an experience and the justificatory force of that experience is\nitself a source of ongoing controversy: Johannes Roesller has argued\nthat John McDowell\u2019s theory of perceptual experience\u2019s\nreason-giving force cannot account for the role played by attention in\nexperience (Roessler, 2011); Susanna Siegel and Nicholas Silins have\nclaimed that the doxastic influence of an experience can be an\ninstance of rational access even when that experience receives no\nattention (Siegel & Silins, 2014); Terry Horgan and Matja\u017e\nPotr\u010d have argued that the justification of beliefs by experience\nmust outrun both the contents of attention and the contents of\nconsciousness (Horgan and Potr\u010d 2011). Here, as above,\none\u2019s understanding of attention and one\u2019s understanding\nof epistemology constrain one another, and may provide a theory-driven\nroute by which to settle questions about the possibility of\nunconscious attentiveness.\n\nThe claim that all attention is conscious attention sits uneasily with\ncertain empirical results indicating that consciousness is not\nrequired for the operation of those psychological processes that are\nresponsible for certain effects that are usually taken to be\nsignatures of attention. In an experiment by Yi Jiang et al.,\n(2006), for example, participants are presented with\nattention-attracting stimuli in such a way that, thanks to an\narrangement of mirrors, these stimuli are given to just one eye.\nBecause a more vivid stimulus is presented to the other eye, and\nbecause this more vivid stimulus wins the competition for\nconsciousness that occurs in such cases of binocular rivalry, these\nexperimental participants do not consciously experience the less vivid\nstimulus. Those unconsciously processed stimuli include erotic\nphotographs. And those photographs do seem to elicit shifts of\nattention, despite being unseen, as is evidenced by the fact that\nconsciously experienced stimuli that are presented in the same\nlocation as these unseen attention-grabbers are more accurately\nresponded to in an attention demanding task (involving detecting the\norientation of gabor-patches). One striking finding from Jiang et\nal.\u2019s experiments is that the way in which these unseen\nphotographs attract and repel attention depends on the sexual\norientation of the experimental participants.\n\nA natural interpretation of these experiments is as showing that the\nerotic pictures capture the participants\u2019 attention, despite the\nfact that those participants have no conscious experience of them.\nThis suggests\u2014although it does not conclusively\ndemonstrate\u2014that one may be attending to a thing without being\nconscious of it. The same conclusion is suggested by a quite different\nset of experiments involving a patient with blindsight.\u00a0 These\nexperiments show that, even though the blindsighted patient has no\nexperience of cues presented in his scotoma, those cues can elicit the\nfacilitation of processing and reduction of reaction times that are\nusually taken to be the signatures of attention (Kentridge &\nHeywood, 2001, Kentridge et al., 2004).\n\nOne complaint against both these lines of evidence is that they do not\nenable us to distinguish between attention to a thing and attention\nthat is directed to a part of space (in which that thing happens to\nbe), with the result that they cannot demonstrate attention to a\nthing in the absence of consciousness of that same thing (Mole,\n2008a). Research by Liam Norman, Charles Heywood and Robert Kentridge\ngoes some way towards addressing this complaint. Norman, Heywood and\nKentridge present normal participants with a screen showing an array\nof small, rapidly flickering Gabor patches. Objects the boundaries of\nwhich are defined by changes in the orientations of these patches are\nnot consciously experienced: Participants merely see the whole screen\nas a flickering array of patches. Cues that direct the attention of\nthose participants do nonetheless seem to draw attention to these\nunseen objects, as indicated by differences in the response times to\nitems that are subsequently presented in and outside of their\nboundaries (Norman, Heywood & Kentridge, 2013).\n\nSuch experiments show that there is an influence operating between\nunconscious processing and the direction of attention, and perhaps\nindicate that attention can be paid to objects that make no showing in\nconscious experience (Mole, 2014a). They therefore place a limit on\nthe closeness of the relationship that can be claimed to exist between\nattention and consciousness.\n\nThe disputes about whether attention is sufficient for consciousness,\nnecessary for consciousness, or both, are related to questions about\nattention\u2019s metaphysics. The claim that attention is not\nsufficient for consciousness is typically made as part of a defence of\nthe idea that attention and consciousness are underpinned by two\ndistinct brain processes, which can occur independently (see, e.g.,\nKoch and Tsuchiya, 2007). The claim that the things to which we attend\nare a proper subset of the things that appear in our consciousness is\nrequired by those who, like Locke (see Section\n 1.3),\n think that there is a process of conscious thinking, and that this\nconstitutes attention when it happens in a certain way.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd the claim that attention is both necessary and sufficient for\nconsciousness is required by those who think that the process by which\nthings come to consciousness is identical to the process by which\nattention is allocated (Prinz, 2005, 2011). Some scientific theories\nof consciousness also carry strong commitments concerning its\nrelationship to attention: Taylor Webb and Michael Graziano emphasize\nthese commitments in making the empirical case for their\n\u2018Attention-Schema\u2019 theory, according to which\nconsciousness emerges from processes in which the control of attention\nrequires a schematic representation of the way in which attention is\nbeing allocated (Graziano and Webb, 2014; Webb and Graziano,\n2015).\n3.1.3 How Does Attention Modulate Phenomenology?\n\nWhether or not one thinks that attention is always responsible for\nbringing things into our consciousness, there are good reasons to\nthink that changes in the direction of our attention can make some\ndifference to the character of conscious experience. Phenomenologists\nand Gestalt psychologists have characterized this difference in\nvarious ways, with Maurice Merleau-Ponty emphasizing the way in which\nattention can configure the figure/ground structure of perceived space\n(Merleau-Ponty, 1962, Chp.3\u20134), and Aron Gurwitsch (Gurwitsch,\n1964) elaborating a theory in which the configuration given by\nattention has a more complex, three-part structure (explained in\nArvidson, 2006). In the second half of his 2017 book, Sebastian Watzl\ndevelops a similar suggestion, on the basis of his claim that the role\nof attention is to impose a priority structure on our mental lives\n(see above\n \u00a72.4),\n (Watzl, 2011, 2017).\n\nThere is currently some dispute about whether the differences made by\nshifts of attention can be adequately characterized as differences in\nthe content of the attended experience. If, as Watzl\ncontends, they cannot, then phenomena of attention create a serious\ndifficulty for any fully general attempts to explain the character of\nconscious experience by reference to the contents represented in it\n(Chalmers, 2004).\u00a0 Such explanations might still be viable in\ncircumscribed domains (Speaks, 2010).\n\nA series of studies by Marisa Carrasco and her collaborators have\nexamined the influence of attention on the character of conscious\nexperience. These have revealed that the phenomenal differences\nproduced by shifts of attention include differences of perceived\nbrightness, contrast, and saturation of colours, but do not include\ndifferences of hue (Carrasco, Ling & Read, 2004, Fuller &\nCarrasco, 2006). Ned Block has suggested that these perceived\ndifferences should not be thought of as differences in the\ncontent of experience, since to characterize them in that way\nwould be to take it that attending to an item creates an illusion as\nto its brightness, contrast, etc.; a result which he takes to be\nimplausible. Block therefore interprets Carrasco\u2019s findings as\nindicating an aspect of experience that cannot be accounted for with a\ntheory in which the phenomenal character of an experience is a\nfunction of that experience\u2019s content (Block 2010).\n\nThere have been similar disputes, transacted on the basis of more\nintrospective considerations, concerning the effects of attention on\nthe perception of ambiguous figures (such as the Necker Cube). In\nresponse to some considerations that were first raised by Fiona\nMacpherson (Macpherson, 2006), Bence Nanay has suggested that the\neffects of attention on the perception of such figures can be\nexplained by those who maintain that every difference in consciousness\nis a difference of content (Nanay, 2010, 2011). His contention is that\nthe effects of attention on the character of conscious experience\nshould be understood as including a modulation of the specificity of\nan experience\u2019s content, in which the representations of\ndeterminable properties are made more or less determinate. The issues\nhere are similar to those concerning the way in which blurriness\nshould be thought to enter into visual experience (see Section 4.4 of\nthe entry on\n representational theories of consciousness).\n\nMattia Riccardi casts attention in a rather different phenomenological\nrole, suggesting (in opposition to the proposal of Matthen, 2010) that\nattention explains the presentness that differentiates\none\u2019s perceptual experiences of real objects in one\u2019s\nimmediate environment from one\u2019s experiences of objects that are seen\nin photographs, or that are pictured by the mind\u2019s eye during\nepisodes of vivid imagination (Riccardi, 2019).\n3.2 Attention and Demonstrative Reference\n\nConsciousness is only one of the philosophically puzzling mental\nphenomena that have been thought to be related to attention in ways\nthat may prove to be explanatorily revealing. Demonstrative\nreference is another. One advocate of the idea that attention\ncontributes to the explanation of demonstrative reference is John\nCampbell, who writes that:\n\n\u2026 the notion of conscious attention to an object has an\nexplanatory role to play: it has to explain how it is that we have\nknowledge of the reference of a demonstrative. (2002, 45)\n\n\nA similar idea was explored in the manuscript on Theory of Knowledge\nthat Bertrand Russell abandoned (under the influence of Wittgenstein)\nin the summer in 1913. In that work Russell gives the following\nstatement of the idea that reference to particulars requires attention\nto them:\n\nAt any moment of my conscious life, there is one object (or at most\nsome very small number of objects) to which I am attending. All\nknowledge of particulars radiates out from this object. (1913, 40)\n\n\nIn support of the Russellian claim that there is an explanatory\nrelation between attention and demonstrative reference, Campbell\ndevelops two lines of thought.\n\nHis first line of thought comes from reflection on examples concerning\nthe requirements that have to be met in order to understand\ndemonstrative expressions in conversational contexts where one of the\nparticipants in the conversation uses expressions such as \u2018that\nwoman\u2019, but where various women are present, all of whom are\npossible referents for this demonstrative. Knowing which women is\nmeant, according to Campbell, requires attending to the woman in\nquestion and knowing that it is to her that the speaker was attending.\nThis is intended to show more than just that the direction of the\nspeaker\u2019s attention is a possible source of evidence for what\nthat speaker means. It is intended as showing that attention and\nreference stand in a particularly intimate relationship\u2014a\nrelationship that Campbell characterizes by saying that\n\u2018knowledge of the reference of a demonstrative is provided by\nconscious attention to the object\u2019 (p. 22).\n\nThe second line of thought that Campbell develops in support of the\nview that attention explains demonstrative reference is one pertaining\nto deductive arguments in which the premises refer to items that are\npicked out by demonstratives: Arguments such as \u2018(1) That is F.\n(2) That is G. Therefore (3) That is F and G\u2019. Campbell\u2019s\nthought here is that such arguments depend for their validity on there\nbeing no possibility of equivocating on the meaning of\n\u2018that\u2019, as it occurs in the two separate premises. Such\narguments can only figure in rationally-entitling reasoning so long as\nthere is a single fixing of the referent of \u2018that\u2019 in both\npremises. This reference fixing, Campbell thinks, is achieved if and\nonly if there is no redirection of attention between the premises.\nAgain this is intended to show more than just that there is some\ncausal or evidential relation between attending and referring. It is\nintended to show that the role played by attention in fixing the\nreference of a demonstrative is analogous to the role played by a\nFregean Sense in fixing the reference of a proper name (Campbell,\n2002, Chapter 5).\n\nThe explanatory approach that Campbell advocates, and that Russell\nconsidered, has traditionally been thought to suffer from a problem of\ncircularity. This problem was urged by Peter Geach in Mental\nActs (1957). Geach considers the suggestion that we can use\nattention to explain our ability to make reference to the things that\nwe perceive, but thinks that no such suggestion can provide a genuine\nexplanation of reference because:\n\n\u2026 it is quite useless to say the relevant sense-perceptions\nmust be attended to, either this does not give a sufficient condition,\nor else \u201cattended to\u201d is a mere word for the very relation\nof judgment to sense perception that requires analysis. (1957, 64)\n\n\nGeach\u2019s threat of circularity can be avoided if an independently\ngiven theory of how attention is constituted can be shown to\nilluminate the way in which reference is fixed by it. Imogen Dickie\nhas attempted to show just this. In a 2011 paper Dickie shows that\ncognitive psychology provides us with a theory of the role played by\nattention in tracking objects over time. She suggests that such a\ntheory can be used to account for the way in which attending to an\nobject removes any knowledge-defeating component of luck from our\ninferences involving it, thereby establishing the attended object as a\npossible topic of demonstrative thoughts (Dickie, 2011, 2015). This\ntreatment of attention exemplifies some of the central themes in\nDickie\u2019s more general attempt to explain how thoughts come to be\nabout ordinary objects (and so how singular terms come to refer to\nthose objects). The explanation that she offers is one in which a\nthought comes to be about a thing when the justificatory practices in\nwhich that thought figures are anchored to the object in question (in\na sense of \u2018anchoring\u2019 that Dickie spells out in detail\n(Dickie, 2015)).\n\nWhether or not a theory of attention can be turned into a non-circular\nexplanation of demonstrative reference, the idea that attention and\nreference are related does seem to cast light on what goes on when we\nunderstand referring expressions. Campbell\u2019s examples succeed in\nsuggesting that what we attend to and what we refer to are often the\nsame. There is also some empirical evidence, coming from developmental\npsychology, indicating that attention-related abilities play a crucial\nrole in the infant\u2019s development of an understanding of its\ncaregiver\u2019s demonstrative use (see\n Section 3.3).\n Lessons have been drawn from this that are not only about the\ncomprehension of linguistic expressions. This developmental work has\nalso been taken to imply something about our grasp on directly\nreferring thoughts. The idea here \u2013 as in the work of\nDickie and Campbell \u2013 is not only that attention contributes to\nour production and comprehension of linguistic expressions that have\nparticular referents, but that it also contributes to the\nestablishment of those referents as the contents of our thoughts. In\naddition to these developmental considerations, Michael Barkasi has\nsuggested that the nature of attention\u2019s contribution to fixing\nthe reference of thoughts can be illuminated by considering the\npattern of neural projections to the frontal eye fields. Whereas\nCampbell characterizes attention in epistemic terms, Barkasi\nfavours a sub-doxastic characterization, in which attention\n\u2018sets targets\u2019 and thereby regulates the flow of visual\ninformation (Barkasi, 2019).\n3.3 Attention and Other Minds\n\nThere are empirical results, coming from developmental psychology,\nwhich are suggestive of an intimate link between the development of\nvarious abilities related to attention and the development of various\ncapacities that are involved in understanding the mental states that\nare expressed in interactions between the infant and its\ncaregiver.\n\nAn ability to appreciate what others are attending to appears to be a\ncrucial stage in a normal infant\u2019s development towards\nunderstanding the fact that its caregivers\u2019 utterances have\nreferential intentions behind them. More generally, capacities for\nattention develop at important milestones on the route to the\nacquisition of some distinctively human cognitive capacities (Moore\nand Dunham, 1995). There is a distinctive developmental pathway in\nwhich normal human infants develop an ability and a willingness to\nattend to their mother, an ability and willingness to attend to the\nthing that she is attending to, and then, most importantly, an ability\nand willingness to enter into episodes in which there is a third\nobject that mother and child are attending to jointly, with\nmutual understanding of the fact that their attention is shared\n(Reddy, 2010, Trevarthen, 2011). In these episodes infants and\ncaregivers employ complex cues, involving speech, gaze-following, and\npointing.\n\nThere is good evidence that the child\u2019s progression along this\npathway is related to its development of abilities to respond\nappropriately to the mental states of others, and to the development\nof its ability to acquire new vocabulary on the basis of an\nunderstanding of what the words used by its mother refer to. A\nlongitudinal study suggests that the earlier stages in this pathway\nare predictive of the age at which infants reach the later ones\n\u2013 thereby providing some evidence for the hypothesis that this\nsequence is a causal one \u2013 with the mastery at twelve months of\npointing as a means to direct the attention of others being predictive\nof false belief understanding at the age of fifty months, even when\nfactors relating to temperament and language are factored out (Sodian\n& Kristen-Antonow, 2015). Another source of evidence comes from\nthe fact that the arrested development of these attention-involving\nabilities is a revealing marker of the impairments suffered by\nautistic children (Kanner, 1943, Hobson and Hobson, 2011).\u00a0\nFurther evidence may also come from the fact that a lack of such\nabilities is related to limitations in the mental-state attribution\nabilities of non-human primates, although this last claim is more\ncontroversial (Call & Tomasello, 2005).\n\nSome progress has been made towards extracting philosophical lessons\nfrom the empirical work indicating that joint attention has a role to\nplay here, in the explanation of distinctively human aspects of\ncognitive and social development, and also \u2013 once that\ndevelopment is complete \u2013 in the explanation of the way in which\nsome elementary social phenomena are transacted. (For several\ndevelopmental examples, see the papers collected in Eilan, et\nal. 2005, and Seemann 2011; for a discussion of joint attention\nin adult cases of shared intention, see Fiebich and Gallagher, 2012,\nwho argue that jointly attending has a basic, elementary status, as\nthe most minimal instance of a joint action.)\n\nOne of the points at which philosophical difficulties arise is in\ncharacterizing the sharedness of the attention that is\nimplicated in this developmental trajectory. Christopher Peacocke has\nargued that the way in which joint attention episodes are shared\ninvolves a kind of reciprocal recognition of the other\u2019s\nrecognition of one\u2019s own attention, and that it therefore\ninvolves a kind of mutual openness that is analogous to the openness\nof \u2018common knowledge\u2019, as that notion figures in\nphilosophical analyses of communication and convention (see the entry\non\n convention).\n Since joint attention is achieved by young children, its achievement\ncannot plausibly be thought to make any sophisticated intellectual\ndemands. Peacocke therefore argues that awareness of reciprocated\nopenness must be more fundamental than the intellectual achievement of\ncommon knowledge.\u00a0 He suggests that it should instead be\nunderstood as a variety of perceptual awareness that makes\nsuch common knowledge possible (Peacocke, 2005). John Campbell shares\nPeacocke\u2019s view of joint attention as being a perceptual\nphenomenon, as opposed to a phenomenon that is achieved when\none\u2019s perception is reflected on in a certain way, but Campbell\ndiffers from Peacocke in taking the person with whom attention is\nshared to be fellow subject of the joint experience, not an\nobject who figures in the content of the experience that each\njoint-attender individually has (Campbell, 2002, Ch. 8).\nCampbell\u2019s attempt to shift the explanation of sharedness from\nthe cognitive to the perceptual domain is rejected by Lucas Battich\nand Bart Geurts (Battich and Guerts, 2020), who suggest that\nCampbell\u2019s view suffers from problems that originate in his\nrelational conception of perception. They therefore claim that the\nissues here cast light on the long-running debates between\nrepresentation-based and relation-based theories of perception (see\nthe entry on\n the problem of perception).\n3.4 Attention and Knowledge\n\nThe apparent links between attention and demonstrative reference (see\nsection\n 3.2)\n and attention and knowledge of other minds (see section\n 3.3)\n might be special instances of a more general connection between\nattention and the making of epistemic moves. A general connection of\nthat sort may have been what Descartes had in mind when he suggested\nthat attention to clear and distinct ideas is a necessary condition\nfor those ideas to realize their special epistemic potential (see\nSection\n 1.1).\n It might also be what Stewart had in mind when he suggested that\n\u201cSome attention [is] necessary for any act of memory\nwhatever\u201d (see Section\n 1.4).\n Kant\u2019s anthropological writings also cast attention in a\ncrucial epistemic role, as explaining the control that one can exert\nover representations in thought and in imagination, where this perhaps\nincludes the kind of imagination that Kant takes to be involved in\nmaking one\u2019s experiences into experiences of an objective\nspatiotemporal world (Merritt & Valaris, 2017).\n\nAlthough each of these philosophers have tended to frame it in a way\nthat reflects their other theoretical commitments, some version of the\nidea that attention is always involved in the making of epistemic\nmoves can be made pre-theoretically plausible. The inattentional\nblindness experiments, in which participants are visually presented\nwith large changes while attending to something else, show that\ninattentive people can fail to notice all sorts of perceivable things\nthat attentive people would find obvious. Something exactly similar\nseems to be true in the case of a priori reasoning: just as no item is\nso large, so central, and so well-lit that no conscious and sighted\nobserver could miss it, so there is no step in reasoning that is so\nsimple, so compelling, and so obvious, that every thinker, whether\nattentive or inattentive, can be expected to recognise it. Just as the\ninattentional blindness effects might seem to show that there are\nattentional demands that a thinker has to meet before his perceptual\nencounter with things can provide him with knowledge of them, so it is\nplausible that there are similar attentional demands that have to be\nmet before the thinker\u2019s grasp of a thought gives her a\njustified belief in that thought\u2019s consequences. This\ninterpretation of the inattentional blindness effects is, however,\ncontroversial. Nicholas Silins and Susanna Siegel have suggested that\n\u2013 even if inattention does sometimes explain a perceiving\nperson\u2019s failure to form a belief about the things happening in\ntheir visual field \u2013 unattended aspects of experience are\nnonetheless capable of providing justification for such beliefs\n(Silins and Sigel, 2019). \u00c9mile Thalbard argues to the contrary\n(Thalabard, 2020).\n\nIn both the a priori case and the perceptual case, the acquisition of\nknowledge seems to require attention on at least some occasions, and\nin both of these cases that requirement seems to be a\npractical one. It may be that knowledge of some propositions\nis required if one\u2019s experience with a gorilla is to provide one\nwith knowledge of the gorilla\u2019s presence (with the propositions\nhere being of a sort that could serve as a major premise in an\ninference by which one\u2019s perceptual experience was interpreted),\nbut the requirement on gaining knowledge from experience cannot be\nthat one must be bearing such propositions in mind. The same is true\nin the a priori domain. What is required before an a priori\nentitlement can be recognized cannot be that one has to entertain some\nprior knowledge of a proposition from which that entitlement can be\ndeduced. To suppose that occurrent propositional knowledge is what is\nnecessary for such moves would be to embark on the regress set by\nLewis Carroll\u2019s tortoise to Achilles (Carroll, 1895). What\nepistemic move-making requires is not occurrent knowledge of a\nproposition. The thing that it requires is the right sort of active\nattention.\n\nThe attentional requirements that have to be met before one can\nacquire knowledge from experience or recognize an a priori entitlement\nare not requirements merely for alertness. They are not captured\nmerely by saying that, in order to gain knowledge, the thinker has to\npay some attention to the relevant ideas. A thinker may be attending\nto a syllogism, but, if he is attending to its rhythm, he may still be\nunable to see that the conclusion follows. A non-question begging\ncharacterisation of the attentional requirements of knowledge\nacquisition in general would be an important contribution to\nepistemology. Current work on attention, focussing as it does on\nattention as a perceptual phenomenon, may give us only part of the\ngeneral theory that we need. Work on the purely intellectual forms of\nattention continues to be scarce. This shortcoming has been emphasized\nby Mark Fortney, who argues that the neglect of intellectual attention\nhas led philosophers to misinterpret some of the claims made in the\nempirical literature on attention and consciousness (Fortney, 2019).\nFortney also claims that considerations pertaining to intellectual\nattention should have a central role in debates about the transparency\nof phenomenology, and about the consequences of this transparency for\nthe epistemology of self-attributed thoughts (debates that are\nexemplified, in Fortney\u2019s discussion, by Byrne, 2018). Fortney\nsuggests that, when attention is given this role, certain results from\ncognitive psychology cast light on these debates. He thinks, when seen\nin this light, some of the claims that have been made about the\ntransparency of occurrent thought start to seem dubious (Fortney,\n2020).\n3.5 Attention and Voluntary Action\n\nAttention\u2019s involvement in voluntary action is a lot\nharder to study in a controlled experiment than its involvement in\nperception. The theories of attention emerging from experimental\npsychology have, as a result, focused almost exclusively on\nattention\u2019s perceptual instances. In this respect they contrast\nwith theories that were developed in the period before psychology and\nphilosophy split, in which the action-involving aspects of attention\nwere much more prominent. William James, for example, suggests in the\nPrinciples of Psychology that \u2018volition is nothing but\nattention\u2019 (James, 1890 p. 424), and at one time (in what might\nbe read as an anticipation of the competition-based theories discussed\nabove, in\n \u00a72.6)\n he proposed that \u201cAttention, belief, affirmation, and motor\nvolition, are [\u2026] four names for an identical process,\nincidental to the conflict of ideas alone, the survival of one in\nspite of the opposition of the others.\u201d (1880).\n\nThe issues surrounding attention\u2019s relationship to the\nvoluntariness of action are parallel to some of the issues surrounding\nattention\u2019s relationship to the consciousness of perception. It\nseems natural to think that attention is necessary for the voluntary\nperformance of finely tuned behaviours, much as it seems necessary for\nthe conscious perception of fine detail. But it does not seem natural\nto think that we must be paying attention to the execution of every\nact that we voluntarily perform, any more than it seem natural to\nsuppose that we must pay attention in order to be consciously\nperceiving anything at all. A case could therefore be made, on\ncommonsense grounds, for claiming that attention figures in the\nproduction of some but not all voluntary behaviours. One can imagine\nthis view being challenged by a theorist who claimed that attention is\nnecessary for any action to be voluntary, arguing that there is an\nillusion (analogous to the refrigerator light illusion) that gives us\nthe mistaken impression that our inattentive acts are voluntary too.\nAs in the case of attention and consciousness, there is a\nmethodological puzzle (with epistemologically deep roots) about the\nsort of evidence that could settle this issue. This may be a topic for\nfuture research. While resisting the idea that attention is either\nnecessary or sufficient for an act to be voluntary, Denis Buehler has\nargued that there is a central role for attention in the explanation\nof flexible goal-directed behaviour (Buehler, 2019). In cases where\nthat behaviour involves the exercise of a skill, Alex Dayer and\nCarolyn Jennings have argued against the idea that any simple account\nof attention\u2019s role in it can be given, claiming that a theory\nof attention\u2019s role in skilled performance must instead be\n\u2018pluralist\u2019 (Dayer & Jennings, 2021).\n\nThe separation of attention\u2019s role in action from\nattention\u2019s role in perception is somewhat artificial,\nespecially when the perception in question is perception of\none\u2019s own moving body. Psychological research into that\nparticular form of perception has been largely independent of research\ninto the role of attention in vision and audition. A 2016 paper by\nGregor Hochstetter reviews the research into this bodily case, and\nargues, following Marcel Kinsbourne (1995, 2002) that internal\nrepresentation of a \u2018body image\u2019 must play some role in\nguiding attention during normal bodily awareness (Hochstetter,\n2016).\n4 Attention and Value\n\nAttention\u2019s contribution to our understanding of values has been\nrelatively underexplored in the recent literature. The range of\nvalue-theoretic contexts in which attention makes an explanatorily\nsignificant appearance is nonetheless broad.\n4.1 Attention in Aesthetics\n\nThe subject matter of aesthetics can be demarcated in various ways,\neach of which is somewhat controversial (see Lopes, 2014). A natural\nthought here is that aesthetics might be identified as the branch of\nphilosophy that is concerned with one particular sort of experience.\nIf this proposal is to be informative then it obviously needs to be\nsupplemented with some specification of which sort of experience that\nis. It is clear that this specification cannot be given via an\nextensional specification of the objects that are experienced: the\nsame wine might be experienced by the connoisseur and the thirsty man,\nwith only one of their experiences being aesthetic; the same painting\nmight be seen aesthetically by the art lover, and from a purely\nfinancial point of view by its dealer.\n\nOne response to this would be individuate experiences more finely than\ntheir objects, by instead identifying some particular set of\nproperties that are experienced as belonging to those objects\nin the aesthetic case (see the section on aesthetic objects in the\nentry on\n the concept of the aesthetic).\n An alternative response would be to consider not only the contents\nthat are experienced, but also the way in which the subject\nexperiences them, perhaps by identifying some particular\nattitude that characterises the subject in the aesthetic\ncase, or perhaps by identifying some mode of attention that that\nsubject instantiates (see the section on the aesthetic attitude in the\nentry on\n the concept of the aesthetic).\n\nAttempts to identify such an aesthetic mode of attention are\nwell-represented in the philosophical tradition. Kant\u2019s famous\nclaims about judgements of beauty having a first moment of\ndisinterested pleasure are usually read as a paradigm of the\nattitude-identifying approach (see the entry on\n Kant\u2019s aesthetics and teleology),\n but Jessica Williams has argued that Kant must also be operating with\na notion of aesthetic attention, as being a mode of attention\ninvolving a distinctive combination of imagination and understanding\n(Williams, 2021).\n\nSome such notion of attention also plays a central role in R.G.\nCollingwood\u2019s account of the way in which art (and, in\nparticular, literature) contributes positively to a society\u2019s\nculture. Collingwood describes attention as \u201cthe assertion of\nourselves as the owners of our feelings\u201d, and takes this\nself-assertion to be crucial in enabling us to exercise volition over\nthose feelings, so that \u201cTheir brute power over us is thus\nreplaced by our power over them\u201d (Collingwood, 1938, p. 222).\nCollingwood therefore takes the diminution of a society\u2019s\nartistic culture to make it vulnerable to emotive influences (while\nhimself suggesting that this might best read, not as a broad\nphilosophical claim, but as a point about Europe in the nineteen\nthirties).\n\nAttempts to demarcate the aesthetic via the identification of an\naesthetic attitude, or of an aesthetic mode of attention, have been\nattacked \u2014 for their details, and for their more general\norientation (most famously by George Dickie, in his 1964 paper). Those\nlines of attack have led to a widespread acceptance of the idea that\nthere is something wrongheaded about specifying necessary and\nsufficient conditions for qualifying as aesthetic via the\nidentification of some particular aesthetic attitude. Many\nphilosophers nonetheless retain the idea that there are informative\nthings that can be said, in the service of less strictly defined\ntheoretical ends, about the sorts of attitudes that are often found to\nbe exemplified in aesthetic cases. It is in this spirit that some\nideas about distinctive forms of aesthetic attention have recently\nbeen revived.\n\nServaas van der Berg suggests that a distinctive mode of attention can\nbe seen in cases of aesthetic appreciation (van der Berg, 2019). He\nclaims that this mode of attention is distinguished by its\nmotivational structure, which has a form that is similar to the\nmotivational structure of game playing, as theorised by Bernard Suits\n(Suits, 1978) and Thi Nguyen (Nguyen, 2020). This structure is one\nthat inverts the normal order of priorities between means and ends: in\nnormal actions one\u2019s means are typically taken in order to bring\nabout one\u2019s ends, but the game-playing golfer (for example)\ninstead adopts the end of getting his ball into a hole in order that\nhe can take the means to reaching that end. Van der Berg argues that a\nsimilar inversion is seen in aesthetic appreciation, where the\ncognitive means that are required in order to reach understanding\nprovide the reasons for adopting the end of understanding an item that\nis being appreciated aesthetically.\n\nBence Nanay has set out a position with similar aims \u2014 not\naspiring to give necessary or sufficient conditions for the aesthetic,\nbut aiming to cast some light on the way in which certain central\ncases of aesthetic experience operate. He does this by giving a theory\nof the distinctive way in which our attention is engaged in the course\nof these experiences. Nanay emphasizes the psychological distinction\nbetween focused and distributed attention, and uses examples from a\nrange of arts to suggest that aesthetic experiences often require\nattention of both sorts.\u00a0 He also suggests this contributes to\nthe value that we place on such experiences (Nanay, 2015, 2016).\n4.2 Attention in Ethics\n\nSimone Weil suggests that attention has an absolutely central role in\nethics, and in value theory more broadly, writing that:\n\nThe authentic and pure values \u2013 truth, beauty and goodness\n\u2013 in the activity of a human being are the result of one and the\nsame act, a certain application of the full attention to the object.\n(Weil, 1986, p. 214)\n\n\nThis apotheosizing of attention provides the basis for Weil\u2019s\nclaims about priorities for education. On these points, her position\nis shared by a number of other figures whose work sits at the\ninterface of philosophy and literature (see Mole, 2017). Christopher\nThomas has suggested that the role played by attention in Weil\u2019s\n\u2018ethics of affliction\u2019 can be interpreted as an attempt to\nput some central notions from Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory to ethical\nwork (Thomas, 2020).\n\nThe influence of Kant was in the foreground, together with the\ninteractions between ethics and aesthetics, when Weil\u2019s claims\nabout attention\u2019s import were developed in the work of Iris\nMurdoch. Murdoch suggests that there are certain forms of attention\nthat play an essential role in the exercise of the virtues (Murdoch,\n1970, see Bagnoli, 2003, Mole, 2006). She implies that a capacity for\nthese forms of attention can be cultivated through experiences of\nbeauty. These themes have been taken up by Dorothea Debus, who places\nparticular emphasis on Weil\u2019s claim that it is full\nattention to which cardinal value is attributed (Debus, 2015). Antony\nFredriksson and Silvia Panizza suggest that the aspects of attention\nthat Murdoch takes to be important are seen with particular clarity if\none adopts the perspective of Maurice Merleau-Ponty\u2019s account of\nattention, in which the openness of the attentive mind is\nemphasized (Fredriksson & Panizza, 2020). Nicolas Bommarito has\ndeveloped an account of modesty along broadly Murdochian lines, as\nbeing a \u2018virtue of attention\u2019. He argues that this avoids\nepistemic difficulties that other accounts of modesty face, if they\ninstead characterize modesty as requiring false beliefs about the\nextent of one\u2019s strengths (Bommarito, 2013).\n\nSimilar issues are approached from a somewhat different direction by\nPeter Goldie (Goldie, 2004), and Michael Brady (Brady, 2010), both of\nwho relate attention and virtue to the epistemic significance of a\nperson\u2019s emotional life. Both Goldie and Brady suggest that the\nattention-modulating profile of an emotion is essential to it, and\nboth claim that this modulation of attention by emotion plays an\nineliminable role in our having a full appreciation of the evaluative\nproperties that we encounter in the world around us. Goldie and Brady\ndisagree as to how this epistemic role should be characterized, with\nGoldie taking the experience of one\u2019s own emotion to itself be a\nreason-giving experience, with an epistemic authority analogous to\none\u2019s experiences of the things in one\u2019s visual field,\nwhereas Brady takes the emotional subject\u2019s experience of items\nin the world to have an epistemic authority that is not shared by the\nsubject\u2019s experience of their own emotional state, so that that\nstate\u2019s epistemic significance must instead be exhausted by its\ninfluence on our outwardly-directed attention (Brady, 2013).\n4.3 Attention in Social and Political Theory\n\nMany theorists and commentators have noted that some of the largest\nbusinesses are, like Google and Facebook, ones that receive very\nlittle money from the end-users of their best known products, but that\ndo receive an enormous amount of attention from those users. Writers\nwho have noted this have often taken it to be symptomatic of a\ncondition that contributes centrally to the current zeitgeist\n(Williams, 2018, Odell, 2019). This contribution is typically taken to\nbe a deleterious one. Michael Goldhaber seems to have been among the\nfirst to describe this condition as a shift from an \u2018information\neconomy\u2019 to an \u2018attention economy\u2019 (Goldhaber,\n1997), following Herbert Simon\u2019s suggestion one might give an\neconomic construal of the fact that attention becomes scarce when\ninformation is abundant (Simon, 1971).\n\nThe suggestion that the present century has seen a distinctive\ncommodification of attention has become widespread. This shift has\nbeen theorized using the conceptual resources of various social and\npolitical philosophies. Jonathan Beller exemplifies a broadly Marxist\napproach, by offering an \u2018attention theory of value\u2019\n(Beller 2006). Clinton Castro and Adam Pham draw on Debra Satz\u2019s\nnotion of \u2018noxious markets\u2019 to argue that technologies\ndesigned to maximize attentive engagement should be regulated in ways\nanalogous to the regulation of the tobacco industry (Castro &\nPham, 2020, drawing on Satz, 2010). Georg Franck uses concepts drawn\nfrom the work of Levinas and Heidegger to give an account of the\nattention economy\u2019s role in mediating our transactions of mutual\nrecognition and respect (Franck, 1998).\n\nThe technologies that have driven this social change do indeed have\neffects on attention. Empirical studies that have measured these\neffects have tended to frame them with reference to their downstream\nsocial consequences, rather than their immediate cognitive basis.\nRosen, Carrier and Cheever, for example, observe the effects of social\nmedia use on the study habits of students at school and university,\nand relate these effects to educational performance, in order to\nsuggest some pedagogical strategies by which these effects might be\nameliorated (Rosen et al, 2013). Such theorists have made relatively\nlittle theoretical contact with the accounts of attention offered by\nphilosophers or cognitive psychologists, although there are some (such\nas Atchley and Lane, 2014) who refer to a bottleneck theory of\nattention, in order to explain the way in which attention-demanding\ntechnologies reduce the attention that is available for other purposes\n(see\n \u00a72.1,\n above). Rather than referring to theories of the cognitive basis of\nattention, claims about the psychological effects of the attention\neconomy have often been framed with reference to theories of the\npsychological basis of addiction (e.g., Bharvaga and Velsquez,\n2020).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Allport, A., 1987, \u201cSelection for action: Some behavioural\nand neurophysiological considerations of attention and action\u201d,\nin <em>Perspectives on perception and action</em>, A.
