    "main_text": "The Second Quarter of the Fourteenth Century\n3. The Second Quarter of the Fourteenth Century\n\nThe preceding theories represent the earliest stage of the\ninsolubilia-literature. Although these theories are sometimes\nmentioned in the later literature, and in the case of\n\u201crestriction\u201d often accepted in the later\nliterature, much more sophisticated treatments began to emerge in the\nsecond quarter of the fourteenth century. The turning point is Thomas\nBradwardine, whose own theory was enormously influential on later\nauthors. Shortly after Bradwardine, two other English authors from\nthis middle period are also important: Roger Swyneshed\n (Section 3.3),\n and William Heytesbury\n (Section 3.4).\n A little later, important contributions were made by Parisian\nauthors, Gregory of Rimini\n (Section 3.7),\n John Buridan\n (Section 3.8)\n and Albert of Saxony\n (Section 3.9).\n",
