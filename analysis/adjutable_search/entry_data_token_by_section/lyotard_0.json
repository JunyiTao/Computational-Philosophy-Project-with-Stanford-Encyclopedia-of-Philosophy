    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nBorn in Vincennes, France on August 10, 1924, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois\nLyotard was the son of Jean-Pierre Lyotard, a salesman. As he reports\nin an autobiographical essay that opens Peregrinations: Law, Form,\nEvent (1988), while schooling in Paris lyc\u00e9es, he had\ndreams of becoming a Dominican monk, a novelist, a painter, or even a\nhistorian. During the second world war, he acted as a medic during the\nliberation of Paris and he became a father soon after studying\nliterature and philosophy at the Sorbonne University in Paris (he\nfailed entrance twice into the more prestigious \u00c9cole Normale\nSup\u00e9riour), which certainly cut off any dreams of becoming a\nmonk. As for being a novelist or artist, he says he had an\n\u201cunfortunate lack of talent\u201d, and an \u201cobvious\nweakness of memory\u201d meant he could never be a good historian\n(Peregrinations, 1\u20132). He met Gilles Deleuze\n(1925\u20131995) while studying at the Sorbonne and his work would\nlater influence Lyotard\u2019s Libidinal Economy (1974). Lyotard\nproduced an M.A. dissertation, \u201cIndifference as an Ethical\nNotion\u201d, whose central belief in indifference he would spend his\ncareer repudiating. In 1954, he would publish a study on phenomenology\n(a textbook treatment that would go through some ten editions) and\nbecame a philosophy professor at a lyc\u00e9e in Constantine, the\ncapital of the French department of East Algeria, having passed the\nagr\u00e9gation that enabled him to do so\n(Peregrinations, 2). Lyotard came to Algeria at a propitious\ntime: near start of the Algerian revolution that would ultimately\nliberate the country from France in 1962, the colony had a\nrevolutionary air that he inhaled in full. After his arrival, Lyotard\nimmersed himself in the works of Marx while updating himself on the\nAlgerian situation. As the revolution began in 1954, Lyotard joined\nSocialisme ou Barbarie (Socialism or Barbarism), which also\nincluded Claude Lefort (1924\u20132010) and Cornelius Castoriadis\n(1922\u20131997), important political thinkers in their own right.\nLyotard became an astute and strident political militant over the next\nfifteen years, writing works that would later be collected in\nPolitical Writings (1993). He edited and wrote for\nSocialisme ou Barbarie\u2019s journal as well as leaflets\ngiven to protesters and union workers, and this work left him little\ntime for academic philosophy (\u201cResisting a Discourse of\nMastery\u201d, 174). He returned to Paris in 1959, becoming until\n1966 a ma\u00eetre-assistant at the Sorbonne, when he\nfinally gained a position in the philosophy department at the\nUniversity of Paris X, Nanterre. In 1964, he broke with Socialisme\nou Barbarie, joining Pouvoir Ouvrier (Worker\u2019s\nPower), quitting that splinter group two years later and, as often\nhappens on the French left, losing many of his closest friends along\nthe way as his distance from Marxism became clear. Around the same\ntime, he began to attend the seminars of the French psychoanalyst\nJacques Lacan (1901\u20131981). This was an important moment as\nLyotard lost faith in the all-encompassing philosophy of Marxism,\nwhich offered, especially in the variant of the French Communist\nParty, a single key to history and its end. This loss of faith in\nMarxism\u2019s \u201cmetanarrative\u201d would expand to encompass\nall those available in modernity, a fact that would come to mark all\nhis remaining writings. This didn\u2019t keep him from participating\nin the events of May 1968, helping to organize the March 22 movement\nin Nanterre. Three years later he would publish Discourse,\nFigure (1971), earning him the degree of doctorat\nd\u2019\u00e9tat. In light of the revolts of 1968, the French\ngovernment set up a radical university in Vincennes, which Lyotard\nwould join, becoming ma\u00eetre de conferences. Two years\nlater, he published a work he later dubbed \u201cmy evil book\u201d,\nLibidinal Economy (Peregrinations, 13). This work\nremains an important thinking of immanence and what a body politic\nwould be like if reduced only to its libidinal pleasures and the\nblockages that make institutions possible. That Lyotard would later\nrepudiate this difficult and complex work should say much to those who\nwould reduce him to advocating a postmodern pastiche where any\npleasure is good as long as it provides some intensity of feeling. In\n1979, he would publish The Postmodern Condition, which was\ninstantly taken as emblematic of what was underway in the West, right\nor wrong. Many would take up his call, as he put it in the book, to\n\u201cwage a war on totality; let us be witnesses to the\nunpresentable; let us activate the differences and save the honor of\nthe name\u201d (Postmodern Condition, 82). The work was both\ndescriptive of what we today would dub neoliberalism\u2019s\nfunctionalization of knowledge\u2014what can be known has value only\ninsofar as it can increase the future economic productivity of the\nresearcher or student\u2014and prescriptive that the loss of\nmetanarratives should be underway. With the fame gained from\nthis book, Lyotard would go on to lecture all over the world, while\nacting as a major contributor to the Coll\u00e8ge International de\nPhilosophie in Paris. In 1979 and 1983, he published Au juste\n(translated as Just Gaming) and The Differend,\nrespectively, two works that remain important to anyone thinking a\npostmodern politics. His later works, such as The Inhuman\n(1988) and Soundproof Room: Malraux\u2019s Anti-aesthetics\n(1998), concentrated on aesthetics, an enduring theme as early as the\n1970s, but always while extending conclusions he reached in The\nDifferend. In April 1998, Lyotard died of leukemia in Paris.\n",
