    "main_text": "Applications of Evolutionary Game Theory || A sense of fairness\n5.1 A sense of fairness\n\nOne natural game to use for investigating the evolution of fairness is\ndivide-the-cake (this is the simplest version of the Nash\nbargaining game). In chapter 1 of Evolution of the Social\nContract, Skyrms presents the problem as follows:\n\nHere we start with a very simple problem; we are to divide a chocolate\ncake between us. Neither of us has any special claim as against the\nother. Out positions are entirely symmetric. The cake is a windfall\nfor us, and it is up to us to divide it. But if we cannot agree how to\nshare it, the cake will spoil and we will get nothing. (Skyrms, 1996,\npp. 3\u20134)\n\n\nMore formally, suppose that two individuals are presented with a\nresource of size \\(C\\) by a third party. A strategy for a\nplayer, in this game, consists of an amount of cake that he would\nlike. The set of possible strategies for a player is thus any amount\nbetween 0 and \\(C\\). If the sum of strategies for each player is less\nthan or equal to \\(C\\), each player receives the amount he asked for.\nHowever, if the sum of strategies exceeds \\(C\\), no player receives\nanything. Figure 13 illustrates the feasible set for this game.\n\n\n\nFigure 13: The feasible set for the game\nof Divide-the-Cake. In this figure, the cake is of size \\(C=10\\) but\nall strategies between 0 and 10 inclusive are permitted for either\nplayer (including fractional demands).\n\n\nWe have a clear intuition that the \u201cobvious\u201d strategy for\neach player to select is C/2; the philosophical problem lies\nin explaining why agents would choose that strategy rather\nthan some other one. Even in the perfectly symmetric situation,\nanswering this question is more difficult than it first appears. To\nsee this, first notice that there are an infinite number of Nash\nequilibria for this game. If player 1 asks for \\(p\\) of the cake,\nwhere \\(0 \\le p \\le C\\), and player 2 asks for \\(C - p\\), then this\nstrategy profile is a Nash equilibrium for any value of \\(p \\in\n[0,C]\\). (Each player\u2019s strategy is a best response given what\nthe other has chosen, in the sense that neither player can increase\nher payoff by changing her strategy.) Thus the equal split is only one\nof infinitely many Nash equilibria.\n\nOne might propose that both players should choose that strategy which\nmaximizes their expected payoff on the assumption they are uncertain\nas to whether they will be assigned the role of Player 1 or Player 2.\nThis proposal, Skyrms notes, is essentially that of Harsanyi (1953).\nThe problem with this is that if players only care about their\nexpected payoff, and they think that it is equally likely that they\nwill be assigned the role of Player 1 or Player 2, then this, too,\nfails to select uniquely the equal split. Consider the strategy\nprofile \\(\\langle p, C - p\\rangle\\) which assigns Player 1 \\(p\\)\nslices and Player 2 \\(C - p\\) slices. If a player thinks it is equally\nlikely that he will be assigned the role of Player 1 or Player 2, then\nhis expected utility is \\(\\frac{1}{2} p + \\frac{1}{2}(C - p) =\n\\frac{C}{2}\\), for all values \\(p \\in[0, C]\\).\n\nNow consider the following evolutionary model: suppose we have a\npopulation of individuals who pair up and repeatedly play the game of\ndivide-the-cake, modifying their strategies over time in a way which\nis described by the replicator dynamics. For convenience, let us\nassume that the cake is divided into 10 equally sized slices and that\neach player\u2019s strategy conforms to one of the following 11\npossible types: Demand 0 slices, Demand 1 slice, \u2026 , Demand 10\nslices. For the replicator dynamics, the state of the population is\nrepresented by a vector \\(\\langle p_0, p_1 , \\ldots ,p_{10}\\rangle\\)\nwhere each \\(p_i\\) denotes the frequency of the strategy \u201cDemand\n\\(i\\) slices\u201d in the population.\n\nThe replicator dynamics allows us to model how the distribution of\nstrategies in the population changes over time, beginning from a\nparticular initial condition. Figure 14 below shows two evolutionary\noutcomes under the continuous replicator dynamics. Notice that\nalthough fair division can evolve, as in Figure 14(a), it is not the\nonly evolutionary stable outcome, as Figure 14(b) illustrates.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n(a) The evolution of fair division. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n(b) The evolution of an unequal division rule. \n\n\nFigure 14: Two evolutionary outcomes\nunder the continuous replicator dynamics for the game of\ndivide-the-cake. Of the eleven strategies present, only three are\ncolour-coded so as to be identifiable in the plot, as noted in the\nlegend.  \n\n\n\nRecall that the task at hand was to explain why we think the\n\u201cobvious\u201d strategy choice in a perfectly symmetric\nresource allocation problem is for both players to ask for half of the\nresource. What the above shows is that, in a population of boundedly\nrational agents who modify their behaviours in a manner described by\nthe replicator dynamics, fair division is one, although not the only,\nevolutionary outcome. The tendency of fair division to emerge,\nassuming that any initial condition is equally likely, can be measured\nby determining the size of the\n basin of attraction\n of the state where everyone in the population uses the strategy\nDemand 5 slices. Skyrms (1996) measures the size of the basin of\nattraction of fair division using\n Monte Carlo methods,\n finding that fair division evolves roughly 62% of the time.\n\nHowever, it is important to realise that the replicator dynamics\nassumes any pairwise interaction between individuals is equally\nlikely. In reality, quite often interactions between individuals are\ncorrelated to some extent. Correlated interaction can occur\nas a result of spatial location (as shown above for the case of the\nspatial prisoner\u2019s dilemma), the structuring effect of social\nrelations, or ingroup/outgroup membership effects, to list a few\ncauses.\n\nWhen correlation is introduced, the frequency with which fair division\nemerges changes drastically. The amount of correlation in the model is\nrepresented by the correlation coefficient \\(\\varepsilon\\),\nwhich can range between 0 and 1. When \\(\\varepsilon=0\\), there is no\ncorrelation at all and the likelihood of pairwise interactions is\ndetermined simply by the proportion of agents in the population\nfollowing a particular strategy. When \\(\\varepsilon=1\\), correlation\nis perfect and agents following a particular strategy only interact\nwith their own kind. Intermediate levels of correlation introduce some\ntendency for agents to interact with their own kind, where the\ntendency increases with the value of \\(\\varepsilon\\). Figure 15\nillustrates how the basin of attraction of All Demand 5 changes as the\ncorrelation coefficient \\(\\varepsilon\\) increases from 0 to\n 0.2.[9]\n Once the amount of correlation present in the interactions reaches\n\\(\\varepsilon = 0.2\\), fair division is virtually an evolutionary\ncertainty. Note that this does not depend on there only being three\nstrategies present: allowing for some correlation between interactions\nincreases the probability of fair division evolving even if the\ninitial conditions contain individuals using any of the eleven\npossible strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n(a) \\(\\varepsilon = 0\\)\n(b) \\(\\varepsilon = 0\\).1 \n\n\n\n \n (c) \\(\\varepsilon = 0.2\\)\n\n\nFigure 15: Three diagrams showing how,\nas the amount of correlation among interactions increases, fair\ndivision is more likely to evolve. In figures 15(a) and 15(b), there\nis an unstable fixed point in the interior of space where all three\nstrategies are present in the population. (This is the point where the\nevolutionary trajectories appear to intersect.) This fixed point is\nwhat is known as a saddle point in dynamical systems theory:\nthe smallest perturbation will cause the population to evolve away\nfrom that point to one of the other two attractors.\n\n\nWhat, then, can we conclude from this model regarding the evolution of\nfair division? It all depends, of course, on how accurately the\nreplicator dynamics models the primary evolutionary forces (cultural\nor biological) acting on human populations. Although the replicator\ndynamics are a \u201csimple\u201d mathematical model, it does\nsuffice for modelling both a type of biological evolution (see Taylor\nand Jonker, 1978) and a type of cultural evolution (see B\u00f6rgers\nand Sarin, 1996; Weibull, 1995). As Skyrms (1996) notes:\n\nIn a finite population, in a finite time, where there is some random\nelement in evolution, some reasonable amount of divisibility of the\ngood and some correlation, we can say that it is likely that something\nclose to share and share alike should evolve in dividing-the-cake\nsituations. This is, perhaps, a beginning of an explanation of the\norigin of our concept of justice.\n\n\nThis claim, of course, has not gone without comment.
