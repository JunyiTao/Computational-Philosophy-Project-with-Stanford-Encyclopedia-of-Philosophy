    "main_text": "\n\nA hyperintensional concept draws a distinction between\nnecessarily equivalent contents. If the concept is expressed by an\noperator, \\(H\\), then \\(H\\) is hyperintensional insofar as \\(HA\\) and\n\\(HB\\) can differ in truth value in spite of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\u2019s\nbeing necessarily equivalent. Necessary equivalence of claims is\nstandardly understood in terms of possible worlds (ways things could\nhave been): \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are necessarily equivalent when they are\ntrue at the same worlds. This is sometimes put in terms of sentences\nsharing an intension. An extensional operator (e.g.,\nBoolean negation) allows substitution salva veritate of\nsentences with the same extension, that is, truth value: if \\(A\\) has\nthe same truth value as \\(B\\), then also \\({\\sim}A\\) has the same\ntruth value as \\({\\sim}B\\). An intensional operator (e.g.,\nthe box of necessity) allows substitution salva veritate of\nsentences that express necessary equivalents: if \\(A\\) is necessarily\nequivalent to \\(B\\), then \\(\\Box A\\) has the same truth value as\n\\(\\Box B\\). The expression \u201chyperintensional\u201d is thus for\nan \\(H\\) that defies substitution salva veritate even of\nexpressions with the same intension.\n\nCresswell (1975) introduced the expression\n\u201chyperintensional\u201d to pick out a position in a sentence\nwhere substitution fails for logical equivalents. Nowadays the term is\nused more broadly, with unrestrictedly necessary equivalence replacing\nlogical equivalence. Candidates for unrestricted necessity often\ninclude, besides the logical, mathematical and metaphysical necessity.\nWe don\u2019t discuss whether one of these is reducible to the\nothers\u2014e.g., the mathematical to the logical, as claimed by\nlogicists.\n\nHyperintensionality is pervasive. Take two claims on your prospects of\ngetting a job you may apply for:\n\n(1)\nYou have 40% chances of succeeding.\n(2)\nYou have 60% chances of failing.\n\n\nThese are necessarily equivalent. However, psychological studies on\nframing effects (Tversky & Kahneman 1981; Kahneman 2011) show that\npeople are more prone to believe in a positive outcome when presented\nwith (1) than with (2), thus more likely to apply. Belief\nseems sensitive to hyperintensional distinctions: we can come to\nbelieve different things depending on how necessarily equivalent\noptions are presented to us (Berto 2019). Framing has vast societal\nimpacts (Thaler & Sunstein 2008).\n\nOn to your neighbor Mike:\n\n(3)\nMike is Mike.\n(4)\nMike is Jack the Ripper.\n\n\n(3) is necessarily true. Suppose (4) is true. If \u201cJack the\nRipper\u201d works as a proper name, (4) is necessarily true, too\n(Barcan Marcus 1947; Kripke 1980). Thus, (3) and (4) are necessarily\nequivalent. But (3) is uninformative (you already knew things are\nself-identical), whereas learning (4) could save your life.\nInformation, this fundamental concept of our age, also seems\nto display hyperintensional features. The difference between (3) and\n(4) is marked by saying that you can know (3), not (4), a\npriori. The concept of a priori, then, has\nhyperintensional features too.\n\nQuine and Davidson\u2019s idea that serious philosophy should use\nonly extensional notions faded in the latter half of the twentieth\ncentury, which witnessed an intensional revolution: a collective\neffort to analyze notions which are fundamental for our understanding\nof the world and of ourselves, like belief, information,\nknowledge, meaning, content, essence, explanation, via a single\ntheoretical system: employing possible worlds and constructions out of\nthem. Standard possible worlds semantics (SPWS) found applications in\nlogic, linguistics, game theory, artificial intelligence: a success\nstory of philosophy. However, many of these phenomena (and, more: a\nsurvey in\n Section 1)\n are, arguably, hyperintensional, requiring hyperintensional language\nto do them justice. And SPWS tends to collapse any distinctions more\nfine-grained than necessary equivalence. The issue of how best to\naddress hyperintensionality has emerged in piecemeal fashion, via a\nseries of difficulties of SPWS (in\n Section 1,\n we list a few). Some have denied that hyperintensionality marks a set\nof real phenomena and have tried to explain away hyperintensional\nintuitions. Some of these general attempts are discussed in\n Section 2.\n\nEven if genuinely hyperintensional language is accepted into our\nphilosophical theorizing, this leaves many further issues open. One\npressing one is the question of \u201cjust \u2018how hyper\u2019\nhyperintensions are\u201d (Jespersen & Du\u017e\u00ed 2015:\n527): what new distinctions should our theorizing recognize beyond\nnecessary equivalence? The mathematical structure of the realm of\nhyperintensionality is not well understood yet. We come to this in\n Section 3.\n However, the early twenty-first century is seeing a hyperintensional\nrevolution (Nolan 2014), with different general approaches currently\nbeing developed, which qualify as hyperintensional in some sense. We\nprovide a critical survey in\n Section 4,\n where we also assess the approaches in terms of how they fare with\nrespect to hyperintensional phenomena singled out in previous\nSections.\n",
