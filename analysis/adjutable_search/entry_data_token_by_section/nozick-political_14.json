    "main_text": "Utopia\n5. Utopia\n\nThe official purpose of Part III of ASU,\n\u201cUtopia\u201d, is to show that the minimal state is not merely\nlegitimate and just; it is also inspiring. This purpose is advanced by\nsketching a framework for utopia that is inspiring and noting that\nthis framework is highly akin to\u2014Nozick actually says\n\u201cequivalent to\u201d (333)\u2014the minimal state. Yet Nozick\nalso says that the framework might not have any \u201ccentral\nauthority\u201d (329). Still, the framework is akin to the minimal\nstate because it is an institutional structure that enforces peaceful\nco-existence among voluntarily formed communities. It protects the\nindependence of such communities and their freedom to recruit members\nand also protects the liberty of individuals to enter and exit\ncommunities as they respectively choose. Although Nozick is not\nexplicit about this, we have to presume that the framework enforces\nthe same norms of personal freedom, property, and contractual\ncompliance that the minimal state enforces except insofar as\nindividuals voluntarily relinquish such rights within the communities\nthey enter.\n\nThe framework is inspiring because of the way it contributes to\npersons\u2019 identification of and participation in communities (and\nother networks of relationships) through which they will find meaning\nand well-being. It is inspiring to anyone who appreciates how little\neach of us knows about what sorts of communities best suit human\nbeings in all their depth and diversity and how much the operation of\nthe framework assists individuals in their discovery of and engagement\nin communities that enhance their respective well-being. Moreover,\nmany persons may value the framework not merely for the way it\nenhances their own good but, also, for the ways in which it allows\nthem to participate vicariously in others\u2019 achievement of their\ndifferent modes of flourishing (Lomasky 2002).\n",
