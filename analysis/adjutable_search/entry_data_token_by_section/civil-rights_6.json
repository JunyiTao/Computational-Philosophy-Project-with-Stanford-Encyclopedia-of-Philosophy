The Right to Vote\n\nConflict over who should have the right to vote has been a part of the\nhistory of modern representative government ever since its emergence\nin England during the 17th century. Because elections are\ncentral to such systems of governance and the different groups that\nmake up society have competing political interests, the issue of which\nsegments of the population should have the franchise has long been\ncontested. Property and sex qualifications drastically limited the\nfranchise into the 20th century. Opposition to universal\nmanhood suffrage came from those claiming that men without sufficient\nproperty lacked the independence of mind and the stake in the good of\nthe community needed for the responsible exercise of the franchise\n(Keyssar 2000: 8\u201310). After industrialization produced a large class\nof wage-workers, a common argument against universal suffrage was that\ngiving workers the right to vote would result in the establishment of\na disastrous socialist or communist regime. Opposition to\nwomen\u2019s suffrage came from those who embraced the traditional\npatriarchal idea that the inherent capacities of women suited them,\nnot for the public world of politics, but for the restricted private\ndomain of family life and the household (Keyssar 2000: 141). \n\nIn the U.S., the right to vote for black men was achieved de\njure shortly after the Civil War, but throughout the South the\nright was de facto denied until the Civil Rights Movement led\nto the Voting Rights Act of 1965. However, efforts to deny blacks the\nvote and to dilute their voting power survived the act (secs. 4.1\n\u2013 4.3 below).\n",
