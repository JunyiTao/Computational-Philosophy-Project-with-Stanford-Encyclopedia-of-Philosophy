Prior to the 1980s, computational modeling of NLP and\ncognition more broadly were pursued almost exclusively within a\nrepresentationalist paradigm, i.e.,\none that regarded all intelligent\nbehavior as reducible to symbol manipulation (Newell and Simon's\nphysical symbol systems hypothesis). In the 1980s, connectionist (or\nneural) models enjoyed a resurgence, and came to be seen by many as\nrivalling representationalist approaches. We briefly summarize these\ndevelopments under two subheadings below. \nRepresentationalist approaches\n\n\u201cA physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means\nfor general intelligent action.\u201d\n\u2013Allen Newell and Herbert Simon\n(1976: 116)\n\n\nSome of the cognitively motivated researchers working within a\nrepresentationalist paradigm have been particularly concerned with\ncognitive architecture, including the associative linkages\nbetween concepts, distinctions between types of memories and types of\nrepresentations (e.g., episodic vs. semantic memory,\nshort-term vs.  long-term memory, declarative vs. procedural\nknowledge), and the observable processing consequences of such\narchitectures, such as sense disambiguation, similarity judgments,\nand cognitive load as reflected in processing delays. Others have been\nmore concerned with uncovering the actual internal conceptual\nvocabulary and inference rules that seem to underlie language and\nthought. M. Ross Quillian's semantic memory model, and models\ndeveloped by Rumelhart, Norman and Lindsay (Rumelhart et al. 1972;\nNorman et al.  1975) and by Anderson and Bower (1973) are\nrepresentative of the former perspective, while Schank and his\ncollaborators (Schank and Colby 1973; Schank and Abelson 1977; Schank\nand Riesbeck 1981; Dyer 1983) are representative of the latter. A\ncommon thread in cognitively motivated theorizing about semantic\nrepresentation has been the use of graphical semantic memory\nmodels,  intended to capture direct relations as well as more\nindirect associations between concepts, as illustrated in Figure 3:\n\n \nFigure 3\n\nThis particular example is loosely based on Quillian\n(1968). Quillian suggested that one of the functions of semantic\nmemory, conceived in this graphical way, was to enable word sense\ndisambiguation through spreading activation. For example, processing\nof the sentence, \n\u201cHe watered the plants\u201d, would involve\nactivation of the terms water and\nplant, and this activation would spread to concepts\nimmediately associated with (i.e., directly linked to) those terms,\nand in turn to the neighbors of those concepts, and so on. The\npreferred senses of the initially activated terms would be those that\nled to early \u201cintersection\u201d of activation signals originating from\ndifferent terms.  In particular, the activation signals propagating\nfrom sense 1 (the living-plant sense) of plant  would\nreach the concept for the stuff, water, in four steps (along\nthe pathways corresponding to the information that plants may get food\nfrom water), and the same concept would be reached in two steps from\nthe term water, used as a verb, whose semantic representation\nwould express the idea of supplying water to some target\nobject. Though the sense of plant  as a manufacturing\napparatus would probably lead eventually to the water concept\nas well, the corresponding activation path would be longer, and so the\nliving-plant sense of plant would \u201cwin\u201d.\nSuch conceptual representations have tended to differ from logical ones\nin several respects. One, as already discussed, has been the emphasis\nby Schank and various other researchers (e.g.,\nWilks 1978; Jackendoff\n1990) on \u201cdeep\u201d (canonical) representations and primitives. An often\ncited psychological argument for primitives is the fact that people\nrather quickly forget the exact wording of what they read or are told,\nrecalling only the \u201cgist\u201d; it is this gist that primitive decomposition\nis intended to derive. However, this involves a questionable assumption\nthat subtle distinctions between, say, walking to the park,\nambling to the park, or\ntraipsing to the park are simply ignored\nin the interpretive process, and as noted earlier it neglects the\npossibility that seemingly insignificant semantic details are\npruned from memory after a short time, while major entailments are\nretained for a longer time.\n\nAnother common strain in much of the theorizing about conceptual\nrepresentation has been a certain diffidence concerning logical\nrepresentations and denotational semantics. The relevant semantics of\nlanguage is said to be the transduction from linguistic utterances to\ninternal representations, and the relevant semantics of the internal\nrepresentations is said to be the way they are deployed in\nunderstanding and thought. For both the external language and the\ninternal (mentalese) representation, it is said to be irrelevant\nwhether or not the semantic framework provides formal truth conditions\nfor them. The rejection of logical semantics has sometimes been\nsummarized in the dictum that one cannot compute with possible worlds.\nHowever, it seems that any perceived conflict between conceptual\nsemantics and logical semantics can be resolved by noting that these\ntwo brands of semantics are quite different enterprises with quite\ndifferent purposes. Certainly it is entirely appropriate for conceptual\nsemantics to focus on the mapping from language to symbolic structures\n(in the head, realized ultimately in terms of neural assemblies or\ncircuits of some sort), and on the functioning of these structures in\nunderstanding and thought. But logical semantics, as well, has a\nlegitimate role to play, both in considering how words (and larger\nlinguistic expressions) relate to the world and how the symbols and\nexpressions of the internal semantic representation relate to the\nworld. This role is metatheoretic\nin that the goal is not to\nposit cognitive entities that can be computationally manipulated, but\nrather to provide a framework for theorizing about the relationship\nbetween the symbols people use, externally in language and internally\nin their thinking, and the world in which they live. It is surely\nundeniable that utterances are at least sometimes intended to be\nunderstood as claims about  things, properties, and relationships\nin the world, and as such are at least sometimes true or false. It would be hard\nto understand how language and thought could have evolved as useful\nmeans for coping with the world, if they were incapable of capturing\ntruths about  it.\n\nMoreover, logical semantics shows how certain syntactic manipulations\nlead from truths to truths regardless of the specific meanings of the\nsymbols involved in these manipulations (and these notions can be\nextended to uncertain inference, though this remains only very\npartially understood). Thus, logical semantics provides a basis for\nassessing the soundness (or otherwise) of inference rules. While human\nreasoning as well as reasoning in practical AI systems often needs to\nresort to unsound methods (abduction, default reasoning, Bayesian\ninference, analogy, etc.), logical semantics nevertheless provides an\nessential perspective from which to classify and study the properties\nof such methods. A strong indication that cognitively motivated\nconceptual representations of language are reconcilable with logically\nmotivated ones is the fact that all proposed conceptual representations\nhave either borrowed deliberately from logic in the first place (in\ntheir use of predication, connectives, set-theoretic notions, and\nsometimes quantifiers) or can be transformed to logical representations\nwithout much difficulty, despite being cognitively motivated.\nConnectionist approaches\nAs noted earlier, the 1980s saw the re-emergence of connectionist\ncomputational models within mainstream cognitive science theory (e.g.,\nFeldman and Ballard 1982; Rumelhart and McClelland 1986; Gluck and\nRumelhart 1990). We have already briefly characterized connectionist\nmodels in our discussion of connectionist parsing. But the\nconnectionist paradigm was viewed as applicable not only to specialized\nfunctions, but to a broad range of cognitive tasks including\nrecognizing objects in an image,  recognizing speech,\nunderstanding language, making inferences, and guiding physical\nbehavior. The emphasis was on learning, realized by adjusting the\nweights of the unit-to-unit connections in a layered neural network,\ntypically by a back-propagation\nprocess that distributes credit or\nblame for a successful or unsuccessful output to the units involved in\nproducing the output (Rumelhart and McClelland 1986).\nFrom one perspective, the renewal of interest in connectionism and\nneural modeling was a natural step in the endeavor to elaborate\nabstract notions of cognitive content and functioning to the point\nwhere they can make testable contact with brain theory and\nneuroscience. But it can also be seen as a paradigm shift, to the\nextent that the focus on subsymbolic processing began to be linked to a\ngrowing skepticism concerning higher-level symbolic processing as\nmodels of mind, of the sort associated with earlier semantic\nnetwork-based and rule-based architectures. For example, Ramsay et al.\n(1991)  argued that the demonstrated capacity of connectionist\nmodels to perform cognitively interesting tasks undermined the\nthen-prevailing view of the mind as a physical symbol system. But\nothers have continued to defend the essential role of symbolic\nprocessing. For example, Anderson (1983, 1993) contended that while\ntheories of symbolic thought need to be grounded in neurally plausible\nprocessing, and while subsymbolic processes are well-suited for\nexploiting the statistical structure of the environment, nevertheless\nunderstanding the interaction of these subsymbolic processes required a\ntheory of representation and behavior at the symbolic level.\nWhat would it mean for the semantic content of an utterance to be\nrepresented in a neural network, enabling, for example, inferential\nquestion-answering? The anti-representationalist (or \u201celiminativist\u201d)\nview would be that no particular structures can be or need to be\nidentified as encoding semantic content. The input modifies the\nactivity of the network and the strengths of various connections in a\ndistributed way, such that the subsequent behavior of the network\neffectively implements inferential question-answering. However, this\nleaves entirely open how a network would learn this sort of behavior.\nThe most successful neural net experiments have been aimed at mapping\ninput patterns to class labels or to other very restricted sets of\noutputs, and they have required numerous labeled examples (e.g.,\nthousands of images labeled with the class of the objects depicted) to\nlearn their task. By contrast, humans excel at \u201cone-shot\u201d\nlearning, and can perform complex tasks based on such learning. \nA less radical alternative to the eliminativist position, termed the\nsubsymbolic hypothesis, was\nproposed by Smolensky (1988), to the effect\nthat mental processing cannot be fully and accurately described in\nterms of symbol manipulation, requiring instead a description at the\nlevel of subsymbolic features, where these features are represented in\na distributed way in the network. Such a view does not preclude the\npossibility that\nassemblies of units in a connectionist system do in fact encode symbols\nand more complex entities built out of symbols, such as predications\nand rules. It merely denies that the behavior engendered by these\nassemblies can be adequately modelled as symbol manipulation.\nIn fact, much of the neural net research over the past two or three\ndecades has sought to understand how neural nets can encode symbolic\ninformation (e.g., see Smolensky et al.\n1992; Browne and Sun 2001). \nDistributed schemes associate a set of units and their activation\nstates with particular symbols or values. For example, Feldman (2006)\nproposes that concepts are represented by the activity of a cluster of\nneurons; triples of such clusters representing a concept, a role, and a\nfiller (value) are linked together by triangle\nnodes to represent\nsimple attributes of objects. Language understanding is treated as a\nkind of simulation that maps language onto a more concrete domain of\nphysical action or experience, guided by background knowledge in the\nform of a temporal Bayesian network.\nGlobal schemes encode symbols in overlapping fashion over all units.\nOne possible global scheme is to view the activation states of the\nunits, with each unit generating a real value between \u22121 and 1, as\npropositions:  State p\nentails state q\n(equivalently, p is at\nleast as specific as q) if\nthe activation qi of each unit i\nin state q satisfies pi\n\u2264 qi \u2264 0, or\nqi = 0, or 0 \u2264 qi \u2264\npi depending on whether the\nactivation pi of that unit in state\np is negative, zero, or positive respectively. Propositional\nsymbols can then be interpreted in terms of such states, and truth\nfunctions in terms of simple max-min operations and sign inversions\nperformed on network states. (See Blutner, 2004; however, Blutner\nultimately focuses on a localist scheme in which units represent\natomic propositions and connections represent biconditionals.)\nHolographic neural network schemes (e.g., Manger et al. 1994;\nPlate 2003) can also be viewed as global; in the simplest cases these\nuse one \u201cgiant neuron\u201d that multiplies an input vector whose\ncomponents are complex numbers by a complex-valued matrix; a component\nof the resultant complex-valued output vector, written in polar\ncoordinates as rei\u03b8,\nsupplies a classification through the value of \u03b8 and a\nconfidence level through the value of r. A distinctive\ncharacteristic of such networks is their ability to classify or\nreconstruct patterns from partial or noisy inputs.\nThe status of the subsymbolic hypothesis remains an issue for debate\nand further research. Certainly it is unclear how symbolic approaches\ncould match certain characteristics of neural network approaches, such\nas their ability to cope with novel instances and their graceful\ndegradation in the face of errors or omissions. On the other hand, some\nneural network architectures for storing knowledge and performing\ninference have been shown (or designed) to be closely related to \u201csoft\nlogics\u201d such as fuzzy logic (e.g.,\nKasabov 1996; Kecman 2001) or\n\u201cweight-annotated Poole systems\u201d (Blutner 2004), suggesting the\npossibility that neural network models of cognition may ultimately be\ncharacterizable as implementations of such soft logics. Researchers\nmore concerned with practical advances than biologically plausible\nmodeling have also explored the possibility of hybridizing the\nsymbolic and subsymbolic approaches, in order to gain the advantages of\nboth (e.g., Sun 2001). A quite\nformal example of this, drawing on ideas\nby Dov Gabbay, is d'Avila Garcez (2004).\nFinally, we should comment on the view expressed in some of the\ncognitive science literature that mental representations of language\nare primarily imagistic (e.g., Damasio 1994; Humphrey 1992). Certainly\nthere is ample evidence for the reality and significance of mental\nimagery (Johnson-Laird 1983; Kosslyn 1994). Also creative thought\noften seems to rely on visualization, as observed early in the 20th\ncentury by Poincar\u00e9 (1913) and Hadamard (1945).  But as was\npreviously noted, symbolic and imagistic representations may well\ncoexist and interact synergistically. Moreover, cognitive scientists\nwho explore the human language faculty in detail, such as Steven\nPinker (1994, 2007) or any of the representationalist or connectionist\nresearchers cited above, all seem to reach the conclusion that the\ncontent derived from language (and the stuff of thought itself) is in\nlarge part symbolic\u2014except in the case of the eliminativists\nwho deny representations altogether. It is not hard to see, however,\nhow raw intuition might lead to the meanings-as-images hypothesis. It\nappears that vivid consciousness is associated mainly with\nthe visual cortex, especially area V1, which is also crucially\ninvolved in mental imagery (e.g., Baars 1997: chapter 6). Consequently\nit is entirely possible that vast amounts of non-imagistic encoding\nand processing of language go unnoticed, while any evoked imagistic\nartifacts become part of our conscious experience. Further, the very\nact of introspecting on what sort of imagery, if any, is evoked by a\ngiven sentence may promote construction of imagery and awareness\nthereof.\n",
