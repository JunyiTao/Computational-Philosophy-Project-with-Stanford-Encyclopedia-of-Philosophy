    "main_text": "\n\n\nThis entry is intended as a brief and general introduction to the\ndevelopment of category theory from the beginning of the Middle Ages,\nin the sixth century, to the Silver Age of Scholasticism, in the\nsixteenth. This development is fascinating but extraordinarily\ncomplex.  Scholars are just beginning to take note of the major\ndifferences in the understanding of categories and of how these\ndifferences are related to the discussion of other major philosophical\ntopics in the Middle Ages. Much work remains to be done, even\nregarding the views of towering figures, so necessarily we have had to\nrestrict our discussion to only a few major figures and topics. Still,\nwe hope that the discussion will serve as a good starting point for\nanyone interested in category theory and its history.\n",
