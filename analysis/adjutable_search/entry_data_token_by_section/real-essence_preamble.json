    "main_text": "\n\nThe technical term \u2018real essence\u2019 is introduced into the\nphilosophical lexicon by the English philosopher John Locke\n(1632\u20131704) in his An Essay Concerning Human\n Understanding[1]\n (hereafter \u201cEssay\u201d) that was first published in\nLondon, in December of 1689. In order to understand a great many of\nLocke\u2019s arguments in Books III and IV of the Essay, it\nis important to understand what a real essence is. Thus, the purpose\nof this entry is to explain the various interpretations of \u2018real\nessence\u2019 that are in the current literature. Another reason why\nthis matters is that the concept of \u2018real essence\u2019 (or\nvariations of it) has been at the center of much of the philosophical\ndebate over natural kind realism since the time of Locke, so some of\nthis entry can serve as an historical introduction to that debate as\nwell.\n\nVery simply stated, a real essence, for Locke, is what makes something\nwhat it is, and in the case of physical substances, it is the\nunderlying cause of the object\u2019s observable qualities (unless\notherwise noted, we shall confine our discussion in this article to\nthe real essences of material substances). A nominal essence, on the\nother hand, is an abstract idea that we make when we identify similar\nqualities shared by objects; the nominal essence is the idea of those\nshared similarities. The distinction between real and nominal essences\nplays an important semantic role in Book III and an important\nepistemological role in Book IV of the Essay. The semantic\nrole will be discussed more below, but in a nutshell, Locke argues in\nBook III that words have meaning only insofar as we can attach ideas\nto them. Since nominal essences are the abstract ideas we use to name\nand distinguish the species or genera of things, the meanings of our\nspecies or genera terms just are abstract ideas. For example, a common\nidea of penguins is of short, black and white flightless waterfowl.\nThat abstract idea is the meaning of the word \u2018penguin\u2019.\nBy contrast, Locke goes on to argue, we have no ideas of real essences\nand so our species or genus terms refer to the nominal essences, not\nto the real essences (II.xxxi.6; citations to Locke\u2019s\nEssay are given as book, chapter, section; so Book II,\nchapter xxxi, section 6 is given as \u201cII.xxxi.6\u201d).\n\nRegarding knowledge, in Book IV Locke argues that knowledge is real\nonly if our ideas correspond to their archetypes in the appropriate\nway. Scientific knowledge occurs when our nominal essence ideas match\nthe real essences. According to Locke, in mathematics and morality the\nnominal and real essences are the same. That is, the definitions of\nmathematical or moral concepts constitute both the nominal and real\nessences of those concepts. For that reason it is possible to have a\nhuman science of mathematics and morality. In the case of substances,\nhowever, the real and nominal essences are always different, and so\nthere is no possible human science of substances\n(IV.vi.12\u201316).\n",
