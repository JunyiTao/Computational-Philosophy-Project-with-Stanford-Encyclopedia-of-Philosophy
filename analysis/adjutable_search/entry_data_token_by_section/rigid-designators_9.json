    "main_text": "Philosophical Work for Rigidity || Theoretical Identities\n3.3 Theoretical Identities\n\nThe statements of necessity associated with rigid designation are\ninteresting from an epistemological standpoint, as just indicated.\nThey are also interesting from a metaphysical standpoint.\n\nRigid designation seems needed on the part of both designators if\nthere are to be true \u201ctheoretical identity statements\u201d:\nstatements in which a designator designates by way of expressing\nexplicitly in some manner one of the designatum\u2019s theoretically\ninteresting essences. The argument is not often put explicitly. It is\nhelpful to outline explicitly the line of reasoning in order to bring\nout more clearly what stands or falls with rigidity.\n\nNot all identity statements widely accepted as necessary specify a\ntheoretically interesting essence in the relevant respect.\n\u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019 or \u2018Cicero = Tully\u2019 do\nnot; each sentence contains only names for an object. But take, on the\nother hand, \u2018Cicero = the organism descended from sperm\ns and egg e\u2019, where \u2018s\u2019\nand \u2018e\u2019 are names for the right sperm and egg.\nMany regard this sentence as necessarily true and revealing of a\ntheoretical essence of Cicero: roughly, a theoretically interesting\nproperty possessed by Cicero in all possible worlds and never\npossessed by anyone else (bear in mind, for this example, limited demands of weak necessity).\n In order for any identity statement to be true of necessity, both\ndesignators must be rigid if either is. And if \u2018the organism\ndescended from sperm s and egg e\u2019 indeed\nexpresses an essence of Cicero, it must designate just Cicero in all\npossible worlds, and hence rigidly: so, given that the statement at\nissue is necessarily true, \u2018Cicero\u2019 must be rigid, too.\nAlternatively, if \u2018Cicero\u2019 is rigid, as is widely\nacknowledged, then in order for the statement at issue to be\nnecessarily true, \u2018the organism descended from sperm s\nand egg e\u2019 must be rigid and so express an essence of\nCicero.\n\nThe foregoing paragraphs address a line of reasoning according to\nwhich rigid designation is needed for certain statements to come out\nnecessarily true. Usually, rigidity is discussed with a view not to\nits being necessary for the completion of a job but rather\nwith a view to its being sufficient for the completion of a\njob. The rigid designation of both designators flanking an identity\nsign in a true theoretical identity statement is sufficient to\nestablish the necessity of the statement. If we acknowledge that\n\u2018the organism descended from sperm s and egg\ne\u2019 is rigid, and we acknowledge that\n\u2018Cicero\u2019 is rigid, then we are committed to the necessity,\nin case of truth, of \u2018Cicero = the organism descended from sperm\ns and egg e\u2019. The reasoning is parallel to\nthat given for the case of \u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019\nabove.\n\n\u2018Cicero = the organism descended from sperm s and egg\ne\u2019 shows that statements about individuals can, in\neffect, be theoretical identity statements. The most commonly\ndiscussed theoretical identity statements concern kinds. They include\n\u2018Gold = the element with atomic number 79\u2019 and\n\u2018Water = H2O\u2019 (Kripke 1980, pp. 138\u201340,\n148). Similar reasoning might apply. Here the reasoning is again\nnearly always left implicit; one must fill in gaps to present a\ngeneral line of thought that seems to accord with a widely held, if\nnot widely articulated, tradition. For that tradition, in order for it\nto be the case that \u2018Water = H2O\u2019 is\nnecessarily true, both designators must be rigid if either is. So if\nthe statement is necessarily true and either \u2018water\u2019 is\nrigid by virtue of being a name for a substance or else\n\u2018H2O\u2019 is rigid by virtue of expressing an\nessence, both designators need to be rigid. And again, the\nrigidity of designators in a true theoretical identity statement is\nsufficient for the statement\u2019s necessity. If\n\u2018H2O\u2019 is a rigid designator of a substance, and\n\u2018water\u2019 is a rigid designator of a substance, and\n\u2018Water = H2O\u2019 is true, then that statement is\nnecessarily true.\n\nTheoretical identity statements are of interest across the gamut of\nphilosophy. Various writers appeal to rigid designation to support\nviews about the essences not only of kinds from chemistry or biology\nbut also kinds from philosophical subdisciplines apparently far\nremoved from empirical science: ethics and aesthetics, for example\n(see, e.g., Carney 1982; Funkhouser 2014, pp. 4, 164; Gampel 1997;\nLeddy 1987; Noonan 2020). The reader interested in pursuing any of these traditions\nshould beware that attempts to apply rigidity in the foregoing\nsubdisciplines, especially early attempts, sometimes confuse rigidity\nwith other phenomena recognized by popular theories of reference: see\nclarifications in section 2.2. \n\nBy far, the most attention concerning theoretical identity statements\nhas focused on the area of philosophy of mind. That is next on the\nagenda.\n",
