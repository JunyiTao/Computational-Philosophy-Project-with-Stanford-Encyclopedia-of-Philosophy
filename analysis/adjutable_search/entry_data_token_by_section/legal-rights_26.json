    "main_text": "Features Salient to Legal Rights || Imperfect Rights\n10.3 Imperfect Rights\n\nEchoing Grotius\u2019s classic distinction regarding moral rights\n(see Darwall 2012: 306\u2013307), law distinguishes between\n\u201cperfect\u201d legal rights, which are enforceable, and\nimperfect legal rights, which are not (Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966:\n233). Although there are imperfect legal rights (e.g., unenforceable\ncontracts, certain immunities, and claims barred by lapse of time),\nthese are not the norm (Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966: 233; Raz 1994:\n256). Law is primarily oriented towards practical application, and\nprobably for good reason. As such, typically legal rights are rights\nthat the law is willing and able to adjudicate and, if violated, to\nimpose remedies or sanctions for their violation. Thus, imperfect\nlegal rights seem to cut against the practical grain of law,\nexplaining why they are atypical. Imperfect moral rights are not\nsimilarly scarce.\n",
