    "main_text": "Second Kind of Position in Feminist Environmental Philosophy: Ecofeminist Philosophy || Ethical Perspectives\n3.8 Ethical Perspectives\n\u201cEcofeminist philosophical ethics\u201d (henceforth,\n\u201cecofeminist ethics\u201d) is the sub-field of ecofeminist\nphilosophy that has received the most scholarly attention. (It has\nalready been discussed in connection with animal ethics, Leopold's\nland ethics, and deep ecology.) Ecofeminist ethics is a kind of\nfeminist ethics. As such, it involves a twofold commitment to critique\nmale bias in ethics wherever it occurs and to develop ethics that are\nnot male-biased. As a feminist ethic, it also involves articulation of\nvalues (e.g., values of care, empathy, and friendship) often lost or\nunderplayed in mainstream Western ethics. What makes its critiques of\ntraditional ethical theories \u201cecofeminist\u201d is that they\nfocus on women-nature connections.\nThere is not one definition of ecofeminist ethics. However, there\nare some themes that run through ecofeminist ethics. These themes are\nabout the nature of ecofeminist ethics generally, not about any particular\necofeminist ethic.\nOne theme is that ecofeminist ethics is a critique and elimination\nof time-honored, mutually exclusive value dualisms, especially the\nculture versus nature dualism. As Plumwood argues\n(Section 2.4), a rejection of the\nculture-nature dualism has implications for an ecofeminist conception\nof the self: humans are both individual selves that are distinct from\nnature and ecological selves that are continuous with nature (see also\nMathews 1994b; Cuomo 2005).\nA related second theme is that ecofeminist ontologies take selves\nto be\n\n fundamentally relational, and therefore deeply social,\nhistorical, and ecological, without losing sight of the great ethical\nand political significance of individual experience, intentions and\nvolitions. (Cuomo 2005: 203)\n\n\nAs Chris Cuomo argues, if one begins with the awareness that\nrelational selves are interdependent selves, then \u201cthe stage is\nset to discuss the relationships between selves and others, and\nbetween community and individuality, without replicating inaccurate\nideas about humans \u201d (2005: 203). Inaccurate views include those\nbased only on positing human identity in terms of individual\ninterests, autonomy, and separation from nature. Caring for oneself,\nfor example, will involve more than protection of individual rights\nand liberties; it will also involve protection of the ecological\nwell-being of others (including nature) with whom we are in\nrelationship. For ecofeminist ethicists, relationships\nthemselves, and not just the moral status of\nthe relators in those relationships, have moral value and are\nsubject to moral critique. This means that how humans are in\nrelationship to others (including nature) matters morally.\nA third theme is that ecofeminist ethics is (or at least aims to\nbe) both inclusive and contextual: it views ethical discourse and\npractice as emerging from a diversity of \u201cnarratives\u201d or\n\u201cvoices\u201d (especially women's voices) of beings located in\ndifferent historical and cultural circumstances. This contrasts with a\nview of ethical theory and discourse as imposed on situations as a\nderivation from some predetermined abstract rule or principle. The\ncontextual inclusivity of ecofeminist ethics involves a shift in\nethics from a monist focus on absolute ethical rules, principles,\nrights, and duties to a pluralist focus on a variety of values, rules,\nand principles in ethics, ethical decision-making, and ethical\nconduct.\nA fourth theme is that ecofeminist ethics makes no attempt to\nprovide an \u201cobjective\u201d moral point of view, since it\nassumes that, in contemporary culture, there really is no such point\nof view. As such, it does not claim to be \u201cunbiased\u201d in\nthe sense of gender-neutral. But it does assume that the gender bias\nit has is a better bias than those of other environmental ethics that\ndo not recognize or include in their ethical theories anything about\nthe varieties of women-nature connections that have been described in\nthis essay.\nThese themes provide a general characterization of ecofeminist\nethics. Consider now three kinds of positions in ecofeminist ethics\nthat have not yet been addressed: care-focused ethics, environmental\nvirtue ethics, and environmental justice ethics. Of these, the most\nwidely defended positions in ecofeminist ethics are care-focused ethics\n(see, for example, Adams and Donovan 2008; Gruen\n2011; Kheel 2007; Warren\n2000).\nEcofeminist care-focused ethics hails back to the work of Carol\nGilligan (1982); it often\nrevolves around \u201cthe justice versus care debate\u201d (see\nthe section on care-focused approaches in the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n That debate was about two\ndifferent perspectives: the \u201cjustice perspective\u201d of\ncanonical ethics, which emphasized individual rights and duties and\nappealed to universalizable rules (or principles), ascertainable through\nreason, for a morally assessment of human conduct; and the \u201ccare\nperspective\u201d, which emphasizes such values as care and empathy\nthat are neither reducible to individual rights or duties nor\nascertained through appeal to ahistorical rules or principles.\nAs ecofeminist care-focused ethics matured, it included a defense\nof care and empathy as \u201cmoral emotions\u201d that are necessary\nto ethics, ethical-decision making, and ethical conduct. It drew on\nthe emerging body of research on \u201cemotional\nintelligence\u201d\u2014a form of intelligence that is different\nfrom but connected to reason or \u201crational\nintelligence\u201d\u2014by cognitive psychologists, neuroscientists,\nand neurosurgeons (e.g., Daniel Goleman 1995). According to this\nresearch, \u201cThe intellect (rational mind) simply cannot work\neffectively without emotional intelligence\u201d (Goleman 1995:\n28). What we do and ought to do in life is determined by both. This\nresearch provides scientific evidence that those who are unable to\nempathize or care (e.g., because of damage to the part of the\nbrain\u2014the amygdala\u2014where care and empathy reside) do not\nsimply engage in bad ethical reasoning; they do not engage in ethical\nreasoning at all.\nThis research on emotional intelligence validated the care-focused\nnature of ecofeminist ethics (see Warren 2000). It affirmed, on\nscientific grounds, that the ability to care and empathize is\nnecessary for ethical reasoning or practice; a failure to care about\nothers (for example, to care about animal suffering or destruction of\nthe planet) is a moral wrong. Humans are beings who can and must learn\nto care about the health or well being of others, including animals\nand nature.\nA second kind of ecofeminist ethic is a version of environmental\nvirtue ethics. Ecofeminist virtue ethics asks what a morally good or\nvirtuous person would do, and which character traits, attitudes or\ndispositions a virtuous person would exhibit, in order to predispose\nthe nonhuman natural environment to survive and \u201cflourish\u201d\nin a healthy way. Chris Cuomo (1998) defends a virtue-based\n\u201cethic of flourishing\u201d. She argues that humans ought to\nact in ways that nurture and enhance the health and well being (or\n\u201cflourishing\u201d) of individuals, species, and communities,\nincluding ecological communities.\nA third kind of ecofeminist ethic is environmental justice-focused\nethics. This kind of ethic appeals to (mainly) distributive models of\nsocial justice to show why, for example, the disproportionate\ndistribution of environmental harms to women and children\n(particularly poor women of color who are single heads of households\nwith children under the age of eighteen) constitutes a social and\nenvironmental injustice. They focus on ways these harms are caused by\nsuch environmental problems as unsanitary water, the location of\nhazard waste sites, and environmental toxins (Gaard and Gruen 2005;\nWarren 2000).\n\n",
