    "main_text": "\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, the \u201cGreat Professor\u201d\n(mah\u00f4p\u0101dhy\u0101ya), lived in the fourteenth\ncentury in northeastern India. In Sanskrit, he wrote a philosophic\nmasterpiece called the \u201cJewel\u201d solidifying\nseveral centuries of advances in epistemology and logic within the\nclassical school of \u201cLogic,\u201d Ny\u0101ya. By all counts,\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba is one of the major figures not only in\nNy\u0101ya but in the whole long and complex history of classical\nphilosophy. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba is traditionally taken to inaugurate\n\u201cNew\u201d Logic, Navya Ny\u0101ya. However, the\ndistinction between \u201cOld\u201d and \u201cNew\u201d Ny\u0101ya\nis problematic, since over the tradition\u2019s almost\ntwo-thousand-year history there are both numerous developments and\nsolid lines of continuity. At no time is there a decisive revolution,\nnot with Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, and also not with Udayana, the\neleventh-century Naiy\u0101yika whom Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba follows more\nclosely than any other thinker and whom scholars sometimes identify as\nthe originator of Navya Ny\u0101ya. However, Ny\u0101ya\u2019s\nmethods of investigation and argumentation on a wide range of topic,\nand against opponents\u2019 views\u2014Buddhists in the early years,\nothers later\u2014do indeed become increasingly refined, and\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s work can in several ways be counted\npivotal.\n\nNy\u0101ya is a multi-dimensional system of interlocking views that\nbelies the stereotype of Indian philosophy as idealist and mystical in\norientation. The school\u2019s founding text is the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra (c. 100 CE), which had elicited tomes\nof commentary long before Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba. Ny\u0101ya is broadly\nrealist about objects talked about and experienced everyday.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba advances what may be called a reliabilist theory of\nknowledge and justification, indeed a super-reliabilism, an\ninfallibilism for externalists in the sense that sources of\nknowledge\u2014perception, inference, analogy, and testimony, his\nmain focus\u2014are conceived factively. Among his most major\naccomplishments are definitions of knowledge in general and of natural\n\u201cpervasions\u201d as underpinning inference as well as analyses\nof conditions governing meaning in knowledge-transfers through\ntestimony. He is also known for crisp treatments of the major types of\nfallacy and epistemic defeater. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba presents, defending\nin long passages, (a) an argument for a self as a special type of\nsubstance, (b) a theistic argument that illustrates his theory of\ndebate and reasoning in great detail, and (c) a defense of the\npossibility of \u201cliberation,\u201d mukti, that both\nenlivens the views of very early Ny\u0101ya\u2014in particular\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana (c. 400 CE)\u2014and becomes influential in\nseveral other traditions and schools. Ny\u0101ya itself has a lively\nliterature that extends to the modern period and, among the\ntraditionally learned, to our own day.\n",
