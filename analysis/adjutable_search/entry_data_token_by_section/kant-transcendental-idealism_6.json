    "main_text": "The Feder-Garve Review and Kant\u2019s Replies || Kant Strikes Back\n2.3 Kant Strikes Back\n\nKant\u2019s was apoplectic that Feder and Garve had, apparently, not\nmade any serious attempt to even understand the Critique, or\nto present its contents accurately to their readers. He penned a\nresponse to the review, published as an appendix to the\nProlegomena. In the appendix, and in the text of the\nProlegomena itself, Kant explains what he sees as clear\ndifferences between his own view and Berkeley\u2019s. First, Kant\nidentifies idealism as the doctrine that\n\n\nall cognition through the senses and experience is nothing but sheer\nillusion, and there is truth only in the ideas of pure understanding\nand reason (Ak. 4:374)\n\n\nand points out that, in this sense, his view is not idealism at all\nbecause the Critique consistently maintains that bodies exist\nin space and that we have immediate (non-inferential) knowledge of\n them.[11]\nSecondly, Kant points out that his idealism is merely\nformal: he has argued only that the form of objects\nis due to our minds, not their matter (cf. Kant\u2019s Dec.\n4 1792 letter to J.S. Beck (Ak. 11:395)). While the form-matter\ndistinction in Kant\u2019s philosophy is a complex matter in its own\nright, Kant\u2019s point seems to be that the matter of\nexperience, the sensory content that is perceptually and conceptually\nstructured by space and time, and the categories, respectively, is not\ngenerated by the mind itself, but is produced in our minds through\naffection by mind-independent objects, things in themselves (see,\nhowever,\n section 3.4\n for some reasons to be suspicious of the doctrine of \u201cnoumenal\naffection\u201d). As he would write several years later in response\nto Eberhard, the Critique \n\n\nposits this ground of the matter of sensory representations not once\nagain in things, as objects of the senses, but in something\nsuper-sensible, which grounds the latter, and of which we can\nhave no cognition. (Discovery, Ak. 8:205) \n\n\nThus, Kant can claim that only the form of experience is\nmind-dependent, not its matter; the matter of experience depends upon\na source outside of the\n mind.[12]\n\nHowever, Kant\u2019s attempts to distance himself from Berkeley may\nnot cut as deep as he seems to think. Regarding the first point,\nKant\u2019s definition of idealism in the Appendix (quoted above)\ndoes not apply to Berkeley. Nor is it clear that his definition in the\nbody of the Prolegomena does either:\n\n\nthe claim that there are none other than thinking beings; the other\nthings that we believe we perceive in intuition are only\nrepresentations in thinking beings, to which in fact no object\nexisting outside these beings corresponds. (Ak. 4:289)\n\n\nOne of the main points of Berkeley\u2019s philosophical project is to\ndefend the existence of bodies in space, while denying what he takes\nto be a philosophical misinterpretation of what this existence amounts\nto: the existence of non-thinking substances. Berkeley does not deny\nthat bodies exist; he claims that bodies cannot exist without minds to\nperceive them, something that Kant himself also seems to accept (see\nthe texts quoted in the previous section). In fact, Berkeley\nconstantly contends that his theory is the only way to avoid what Kant\ncalls \u201cproblematic\u201d idealism: we do not know whether\nbodies exist (Treatise on the Principles of Human Knowledge,\nPart I, \u00a7 1, 6, 18, 20, 22\u201324, 34\u201338). That Kant\nwould describe Berkeley as an idealist in this sense (what he\nelsewhere designates a \u201cdogmatic idealist\u201d) raises the\nsuspicion that has misread\n Berkeley.[13]\n Since the misinterpretation of Berkeley as holding that sense\nperception is illusory and that bodies do not exist was widespread in\nGermany in the eighteenth-century (again, see Beiser 2002), it is\nquite possible that Kant shares it. It may be that Kant is more\nsimilar to Berkeley than he realizes because he is not familiar with\nBerkeley\u2019s actual theory.\n\nNor does another point Kant makes\u2014that Kant\u2019s idealism\nconcerns merely the form and not the matter of\nexperience\u2014constitute a clear difference from Berkeley. Berkeley\ndoes not claim that human spirits are the causes of their own ideas;\nhe claims that God acts on human spirits, causing us to perceive an\ninternally and inter-subjectively consistent world of ideas. Since\nKant\u2019s official doctrine in the Critique seems to\nrequire agnosticism about the ultimate nature of the things in\nthemselves that causally affect us in experience, it is compatible\nwith what he says that the noumenal cause of experience is God\nhimself.\n\nKant\u2019s argument might be that the matter of experience (its\nsensory content) depends upon how our sensibility is affected by\nmind-independent objects, things in themselves, while the form of\nexperience is determined by our minds alone. Consequently, experience\nitself requires the existence of objects \u201coutside\u201d (in the\ntranscendental sense) the mind. But this would show, at most, that\nKant is not a strong phenomenalist. It does not undercut the\ninterpretation of him as a qualified phenomenalist. Nor does it\nsucceed in clearly differentiating him from Berkeley. (See the\nsupplementary article:\n Kant\u2019s Attempts to Distance Himself from Berkeley.)\n This, of course, does not settle the issue; it may be that Kantian\nappearances are quite different than bodies, as Berkeley, or even the\nqualified phenomenalist, conceive them (for important discussions of\ntranscendental idealism in the Prolegomena see Ak.\n4:283\u20134, 286, 289\u2013294, 314\u2013315, 320).\n",
