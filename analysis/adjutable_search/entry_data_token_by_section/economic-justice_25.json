The\nfindings are well summarized in many surveys (see in particular Diener\n(1994, 2000), Diener et al. (1999), Frey and Stutzer (2002), Graham\n(2009), Kahneman et al. (1999), Kahneman and Krueger (2006), Layard\n(2005), Oswald (1997), Van Praag and Ferrer-i-Carbonell 2008), and\nreveal the main factors of happiness: personal temperament, health,\nsocial connections (in particular being married and employed). The\nimpact of material wealth is debated, some arguing that it is more a\nmatter of relative position than of absolute comfort, at least above a\nminimal level of affluence (Easterlin 1995, Clark et al. 2008), others\narguing that there is a positive (but logarithmic: doubling income\ninduces a constant increment on happiness) impact over the whole range\nof observed living standards (Deaton 2008, Sacks et al. 2010) .\n\nA hotly debated question is what to make of this approach in welfare\neconomics. There is a wide variety of positions, from those who\npropose to measure and maximize national happiness (Diener 2000,\nKahneman et al. 2004, Layard 2005) to those who firmly oppose this\nidea on various grounds (Burchardt 2006, Nussbaum 2008, among others).\nThere seems to be a consensus on the idea that happiness studies\nsuggest a welcome shift of focus, in social evaluation, from purely\nmaterialistic performances to a broader set of values. Above all, one\ncan consider that the traditional suspicion among economists about the\npossibility to measure subjective well-being is being assuaged by the\nrecent progress.\n\nHowever, the fact that subjective well-being can be measured does not\nimply that it ought to be taken as the metric of social evaluation.\nSurprisingly, the literature on happiness refers very little to the\nlively philosophical debates of the previous decades about welfarism,\nand in particular the criticisms raised by Rawls (1982) and Sen (1985)\nagainst utilitarianism. (Two exceptions are Burchardt (2006) and\nSchokkaert (2007). Layard (2005) also mentions and quickly rebuts some\nof the arguments against welfarism.) Nonetheless, one of the key\nelements of that earlier debate, namely, the fact that subjective\nadaptation is likely to hide objective inequalities, shows up in the\ndata, challenging happiness specialists. Subjective well-being seems\nrelatively immune in the long run to many aspects of objective\ncircumstances, individuals displaying a remarkable ability to adapt.\nAfter most important life events, satisfaction returns to its usual\nlevel and the various affects return to their usual frequency. If\nsubjective well-being is not so sensitive to objective circumstances,\nshould we stop caring about inequalities, safety, and\nproductivity?\n\nThese issues and the possible uses of subjective well-being data for\nwelfare analysis are discussed in detail in several chapters of Adler\nand Fleurbaey (2016), in particular the chapters by Fujiwara and\nDolan, Bykvist, Haybron, Lucas, Graham, Clark, Decancq and\nNeumann.\n",
