    "main_text": "Questions about Realism and Explanation || The Nature of Chaos Explanations\n5.2 The Nature of Chaos Explanations\n\nChaos has been invoked as an explanation for, or as contributing\nsubstantially to explanations of, actual-world behaviors. Some examples\nare epileptic seizures, heart fibrillation, neural processes, chemical\nreactions, weather, industrial control processes and even forms of\nmessage encryption. Aside from irregular behavior of actual-world\nsystems, chaos is also invoked to explain features such as the actual\ntrajectories exhibited in a given state space or the sojourn times of\ntrajectories in particular regions of state space. But what, exactly,\nis the role chaos plays in these various explanations? More succinctly,\nwhat are chaos explanations?\n\n\nThe nature of scientific explanation (see the entry on \n scientific explanation)\n in the literature on chaos is thoroughly under-discussed to put\nit mildly. Traditional accounts for scientific explanation such as\ncovering-law, causal mechanical and unification models all present\nvarious kinds of drawbacks when applied to chaotic phenomena. For\ninstance, if there are no universal laws lying at the heart of chaos\nexplanations\u2014and it does not seem credible that such laws could\nreally play a role in chaos explanations\u2014covering-law models do\nnot look promising as candidates for chaos explanations.\n\n\nRoughly speaking, the causal-mechanical model of explanation\nmaintains that science provides understanding of diverse facts and\nevents by showing how these fit into the causal structure of the world.\nIf chaos is a behavior exhibited by nonlinear systems (mathematical and\nphysical), then it seems reasonable to think that there might be some\nmechanisms or processes standing behind this behavior. After all, chaos\nis typically understood to be a property of the dynamics of such\nsystems, and dynamics often reflects the processes at work\nand their interactions. The links between causal mechanisms and\nbehaviors in the causal-mechanical model are supposed to be reliable\nlinks along the following lines: If mechanism \\(C\\) is present, behavior\n\\(B\\) typically follows. In this sense, chaos explanations,\nunderstood on the causal-mechanical model, are envisioned as providing\nreliable connections between mechanisms and the chaotic behavior\nexhibited by systems containing such mechanisms.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the basic idea of unification accounts of\nexplanation is that science provides understanding of diverse facts and\nevents by showing how these may be unified by a much smaller set of\nfactors (e.g., laws or causes). Perhaps one can argue\nthat chaos is a domain or set of a limited number of patterns and tools\nfor explaining/understanding a set of characteristic behaviors found in\ndiverse phenomena spread across physics, chemistry, biology, economics,\nsocial psychology, and so forth. In this sense the set of patterns or\nstructures (e.g., \u201cstretching and folding\u201d) might make up\nthe explanatory store unifying our understanding of all the diverse\nphenomena behaving chaotically.\n\n5.2.1 Explanation, Faithful Models and Chaos\n\nBoth causal and unification accounts, as typically conceived, assume\nthat theories are in place and that the models of those theories play\nsome role in explanation. In causal accounts, causal processes are key\ncomponents of the models. In unification accounts, laws might be the\nultimate explanatory factors, but we often connect laws with physical\nsystems via models. To be explanatory, however, such accounts must make\nthe faithful model assumption; namely, that our models (and their state\nspaces) are faithful in what they say about actual systems.\n\n\nRecall that SD\u2014exponential divergence of neighboring\ntrajectories\u2014is taken by many to be a necessary condition for\nchaos. As we saw in\n \u00a73,\n it is not straightforward to confirm when we have a\nmodel serving as a good explanation because, for instance, the\nslightest refinement of initial conditions can lead to wildly\ndiffering behavior. So on many standard approaches to confirmation and\nmodels, it would be difficult to say when we had a good\nexplanation. Even if we push the faithful model assumption to its\nextreme limit\u2014i.e., assuming the model is perfect\u2014we run\ninto tricky questions regarding confirmation since there are too many\nstates indistinguishable from the actual state of the system yielding\nempirically indistinguishable trajectories in the model state space\n(Judd and Smith 2001). \n\nPerhaps with chaos explanation we should either search for a process\nyielding the \u201cstretching and folding\u201d in the dynamics\n(causal form of explanation) or we should search for the common\nproperties such behavior exhibits (unification form of explanation)\nunderlying the behavior of the nonlinear systems of interest. In other\nwords, we want to be able to understand why systems exhibit SDIC,\naperiodicity, randomness, and so forth. But these are the properties\ncharacterizing chaotic behavior, so the unification account of\nexplanation sounds like it may ultimately involve appealing to the\nproperties in need of explanation.\n\n\nThe explanatory picture becomes more complicated by shifting away\nfrom SD as characterized by a positive global Lyapunov exponent and\nsettling for what may be more realistic, namely the effects of\ndivergence/contraction characterized by finite-time Lyapunov exponents.\nHowever, even in this case, it appears that the properties to which one\nappeals on a unification account pick out the patterns of chaos that we\nwant to understand: How do these properties arise? It seems that\nunification accounts are still at a disadvantage in characterizing\nchaos explanations.\n\n\nSuppose we appealed to strange attractors in our models or in state\nspace reconstruction techniques. Would this be evidence that there is\na strange attractor in the target system\u2019s behavior? Modulo\nworries raised in\n \u00a75.1,\n even if the presence of a strange attractor in the state space was\nboth a necessary and sufficient condition for the model being chaotic,\nthis would not amount to an explanation of chaotic behavior in the\ntarget system. First, the strange attractor is an object in state\nspace, which is not the same as saying that the actual system behaves\nas if there is a strange attractor in the physical space of its\nactivity. A trajectory in a state space is a way of gaining useful\ninformation about the target system (via the faithful model\nassumption), but it is different from trajectories developed by\nlooking at how an actual system\u2019s properties change with respect to time. Just\nbecause a trajectory of a system in state space is spiraling ever\ncloser to the strange attractor does not imply that the target\nsystem\u2019s behavior in physical space is somehow approaching that\nattractor (except possibly under the perfect model scenario). Second,\nbut related, the presence of a strange attractor would only be a mark\nof chaos, not an explanation for why chaotic properties are being\nexhibited by a system. It seems we still need to appeal to processes\nand interactions causing the dynamics to have the characteristic\nproperties we associate with chaos. \n\nAt this point, a question implied at the end of the previous\nsubsection arises, namely what is effecting the unification in chaos\nexplanations? Unification models of explanation typically posit an\nexplanatory store of a relatively small number of laws or mechanisms\nthat serve to explain or unify a diverse set of phenomena. A standard\nexample is that of Newtonian mechanics providing a small set of\nprinciples that could serve to explain phenomena as diverse as projectile\nmotions, falling bodies, tides, planetary orbits and pendula. In this\nway, we say that Newtonian mechanics unified a diverse set of phenomena\nby showing that they all were governed by a small set of physical\nprinciples. Now, if a unification construal of chaos explanations only\nfocuses on the mathematical similarities in behaviors of diverse\nphenomena (e.g., period doubling route to chaos or SDIC), then one can\nlegitimately question whether the relevant sense of unification is in\nplay in chaos explanations. The \u201cexplanatory store\u201d of\nchaos explanations is indeed a small set of mathematical and\ngeometrical features, but is this the wrong store (compare with the\nphysical principles of Newtonian mechanics)? However, if unification is\nsupposed to be achieved through underlying mechanisms producing these\nmathematical and geometrical features, then the explanatory store\nappears to be very large and heterogeneous\u2014the mechanisms in\nphysics are different from those in biology, are different from those\nin ecology, are different from those in economics are different from\nthose in social psychology\u2026Once again, the causal-mechanical model\nappears to make more sense for characterizing the nature of chaos\nexplanations.\n\n5.2.2 Chaos and Understanding\n\nIf this were all there was to the story of chaos explanations, then\na causal account of explanation looks more promising. But it would also\nbe the case that there is nothing special about such explanations:\nThere are processes and interactions that cause the dynamics to have\nchaotic properties. But Stephen Kellert (1993, ch.\u00a04) maintains that\nthere is something new about chaotic dynamics, forcing us to rethink\nexplanation when it comes to chaos models. His proposal for chaos\nexplanations as yielding qualitative understanding of system behavior\nsuggests that causal accounts, at least, do not fit well with what is\ngoing on in chaos research.\n\n\nKellert first focuses on one of the key intuitions driving many\nviews in debates on scientific explanation: Namely, that the sciences\nprovide understanding or insight into phenomena. Chaos explanations,\naccording to Kellert, achieve understanding by constructing,\nelaborating and applying simple dynamical models. He gives three points\nof contrast between this approach to understanding and what he takes to\nbe the standard approach to understanding in the sciences. The first is\nthat chaos explanations involve models that are holistic\nrather than microreductionist. Models of the latter type seek to break\nsystems down into their constituent parts and look for law-like\nrelations among the parts. In contrast, many of the mathematical tools\nof chaotic dynamics are holistic in that they extract or reveal\ninformation about the behavior of the model system as a whole not\nreadily apparent from the nonlinear equations of the model themselves.\nMethods such as state space reconstruction and sections-of-surface can\nreveal information implicit in the nonlinear equations. Developing one-\nand two-dimensional maps from the model equations can also provide this\nkind of information directly, and are much simpler than the full model\nequations.\n\n\nWhereas the first point of contrast is drawn from the practice of\nphysics, the second is logical. After reducing the system to its\nparts, the next step in the standard approach to understanding,\naccording to Kellert, is to construct a \u201cdeductive scheme, which\nyields a rigorous proof of the necessity (or expectability) of the\nsituation at hand\u201d (1993, p.\u00a091). What Kellert is\nreferring to, here, is the deductive-nomological account of\nexplanation (see Section 2 of the entry on\n scientific explanation,\non the DN model). The approach in chaotic dynamics makes\nno use of deductive inferences. Specifically, instead of looking at\nbasic principles, propositions, and so on, and making deductive\ninferences, chaos explanations appeal to computer simulations because\nof the difficulty or even impossibility of deducing the chaotic\nbehavior of the system from the model equations (e.g., no proof of SD\nfor the Lorenz model based on the governing equations).\n\n\nThe third point of contrast is historical. In contexts where linear\nsuperposition holds, a full specification of the instantaneous state\nplus the equations of motion yield all the information about the\nsystem there is to know (e.g., pendulum and projectile\nmotion). Although a full specification of such states is impossible,\nvery small errors in specifying such states lead to very small\ndeviations between model and target system behaviors, at least for\nshort times and good models. By contrast, in nonlinear contexts, where\nlinear superposition fails, a full specification of an instantaneous\nstate of the system plus the equations of motion does not yield all\nthe information there is about the system, for example, if there are\nmemory effects (hysteresis), or the act of measurements introducing\ndisturbances that SDIC can amplify. In the former case, we also need to know the\nhistory of the system as well (whether it started out below the\ncritical point or above the critical point, say). So chaos\nexplanations must also take model histories into account.\n\n\nWhat kind of understanding is achieved in chaos explanations?\nKellert argues we get (1) predictions of qualitative behavior rather\nthan quantitative detail, (2) geometric mechanisms rather than causal\nprocesses, and (3) patterns rather than law-like necessity.\n\n\nRegarding (1), detailed predictions regarding individual\ntrajectories fail rather rapidly for chaotic models when there is any\nerror in specification of the initial state. So, says Kellert, instead\nwe predict global behaviors of models and have an account of limited\npredictability in chaotic models. But many of these behaviors can be\nprecisely predicted (e.g., control parameter\n values[9]\n at which various bifurcations occur, the onset of chaos, the return\nof n-periodic orbits). (1) amounts to important, but limited\ninsight. On this view we are able to predict when to expect\nqualitative features of the nonlinear dynamics to undergo a sudden\nchange, but chaos models do not yield precise values of system\nvariables. We get the latter values by running full-blow computer\nsimulations on the full nonlinear model equations, provided the\ndegrees of freedom are reasonable. In this sense, chaos explanations\nare complimentary to the full model simulation because the former can\ntell us when/where to expect dynamical changes such as the onset of\ncomplicated dynamics in the latter. \n\nRegarding (2), chaos explanation is not a species of causal\nexplanation. That is to say, chaos explanations do not focus on or\nreveal processes and interactions giving rise to the dynamics; rather,\nthey reveal large-scale geometric features of the dynamics. Kellert\nargues the kinds of mechanisms on which chaos explanations focus are\nnot causal, but geometric. Part of the reason why he puts things this\nway is that he views typical causal accounts of explanation as\noperating in a reductive mode: trace the individual causal processes\nand their interactions to understand the behavior of the system. But\nchaos explanations, according to Kellert, eschew this approach,\nfocusing instead on the behavior of systems as wholes. Indeed, chaos\nexplanations tend to group models and systems together as exhibiting\nsimilar patterns of behavior without regard for their underlying causal\ndifferences. Causal processes are ignored; instead, universal patterns\nof behavior are the focus. And it is the qualitative information about\nthe geometric features of the model that are key to chaos explanations\nfor Kellert.\n\n\nRegarding (3), if scientific understanding is only to be achieved\nvia appeal to universal laws expressing nomic necessity\u2014still a\nstrong intuition among many philosophers\u2014then chaos explanations\ndefinitely do not measure up. Chaos explanations do not rely on nomic\nconsiderations at all; rather, they rely on patterns of behavior and\nvarious properties characterizing this behavior. In brief, chaos\nstudies search for patterns rather than laws.\n\n\nBut suppose we change the notion of laws from universal statements of\nnomic necessity to phenomenological regularities (e.g., Cartwright\n1999; Dupr\u00e9 1993)? Could chaos explanations then be understood\nas a search for such phenomenological laws at the level of wholes?\nAfter all, chaos as a field is not proposing any revisions to physical\nlaws the way relativity and quantum mechanics did. Rather, if it is\nproposing anything, it is new levels of analysis and techniques for\nthis analysis. Perhaps it is at the level of wholes that interesting\nphenomenological regularities exist that cannot be probed by\nmicroreductionist approaches. But this feature, at least on first\nblush, may not count against the microreductionist in anything other\nthan an epistemological sense, that is, holistic methodologies are\nmore effective for answering some questions chaos raises.\n\n\nThis dynamical understanding, as Kellert denotes it,\nachieved by chaos models would suggest that typical causal accounts of\nexplanation are aimed at a different level of understanding. In other\nwords, causal accounts look much more consonant with studying the full\nnonlinear model. Chaos explanation, by contrast, pursues understanding\nby using reduced equations derived through various techniques, though\nstill based on the full nonlinear equations. This way of\nviewing things suggests that there is a kind of unification going on in\nchaos explanation after all. A set of behavior patterns serves as the\nexplanatory or unificatory features bringing together the appearance of\nsimilar features across a very diverse set of phenomena and disciplines\n(note: Kellert does not discuss unification accounts). This, in turn,\nsuggests a further possibility: A causal account of explanation is more\nappropriate at the level of the full model, while a unification account\nperhaps is more appropriate at the level of the chaotic model. The\napproaches would be complementary rather than competing.\n\n\nFurthermore, the claim is that study of such chaotic models can give\nus understanding of the behavior in corresponding actual-world systems.\nNot because the model trajectories are isomorphic to the system\ntrajectories; rather, because there is a topological or geometric\nsimilarity or correspondence between the models and the systems being\nmodeled. This is a different version of the faithful model assumption\nin that now the topological/geometric features of target systems are\ntaken to be faithfully represented by our chaotic models.\n\n5.2.3 Nothing New under the Sun?\n\nIn contrast to Kellert, Peter Smith makes it clear that he thinks\nthere is nothing particularly special about chaos explanations in\ncomparison with explanation in mathematical physics in general (1998,\nch.\u00a07). Perhaps it simply is the case that mathematical physics\nexplanations are not well captured by philosophical accounts of\nexplanation and this mismatch\u2014peculiarly highlighted in a catchy\nfield such as chaos\u2014could provide some of the reason for why\npeople have taken chaos explanations to pose radical challenges to\ntraditional philosophical accounts of explanation.\n\n\nIn particular, Smith takes issue with Kellert\u2019s view that\nchaos explanations are, in the main, qualitative rather than\nquantitative. He points out that we can calculate Lyapunov exponents,\nbifurcation points as control parameters change, and even use chaos\nmodels be predict the values of evolving dynamical\nvariables\u2014\u201cindividual trajectory picture\u201d\u2014at\nleast for some short time horizon. So perhaps there is more\nquantitative information to be gleaned from chaos models than Kellert\nlets on (this is particularly true if we turn to statistical methods of\nprediction). Furthermore, Smith argues that standard physics\nexplanations, along with quantitative results, always emphasize the\nqualitative features of models as well.\n\n\nWe might agree, then, that there is nothing particularly special or\nchallenging about chaos explanations relative to other kinds of\nexplanation in physics regarding qualitative/quantitative\nunderstanding. What does seem to be the case is that chaos\nmodels\u2014and nonlinear dynamics models generally\u2014make the\nextraction of usefulness quantitative information more difficult. What\nis exhibited by methodological approaches in chaos is not that\ndifferent from what happens in other areas of mathematical physics,\nwhere the mathematics is intractable and the physical insight comes with a struggle.\nMoreover, there is no guarantee that in the future we will not make\nsome kind of breakthrough placing chaos models on a much sounder first\nprinciples footing, so there does not seem to be much substance to\nthe claim that chaos explanations are different in kind from other\nmodes of explanation in mathematical physics.\n\n5.3 Taking Stock\n\nKellert\u2019s discussion of \u201cdynamic understanding\u201d\nand Peter Smith\u2019s critical remarks both overlap in their agreement that\nvarious robust or universal features of chaos are important for chaos\nstudies The idea of focusing on universal features such as patterns,\ncritical numbers, and so forth suggests that some form of unification\naccount of explanation is what is at work in chaos explanations: group\ntogether all examples of chaotic behavior via universal patterns and\nother features (e.g., period doubling sequences). There is disagreement\non the extent to which the methodologies of current chaos research\npresent any radically new challenges to the project of scientific\nexplanation.\n\n\nEven if there is not something radically new here regarding\nscientific explanation, the kind of understanding provided by chaos\nmodels is challenging to clarify. One problem is that this\n\u201cdynamic understanding\u201d appears to be descriptive only.\nThat is, Kellert seems to be saying we understand how chaos arises when\nwe can point to a period doubling sequence or to the presence of a\nstrange attractor, for instance. But this appears to be only providing\ndistinguishing marks for chaos rather than yielding genuine insight\ninto what lies behind the behavior, i.e., the cause of the\nbehavior. Kellert eschews causes regarding chaos explanations and there\nis a fairly straightforward reason for this: The simplified models of\nchaos appear to be just mathematics (e.g., one dimensional maps)\nbased on the original nonlinear equations. In other words, it\nlooks as if the causes have been squeezed out! So the question of\nwhether causal, unificationist or some other approach to scientific\nexplanation best captures chaos research remains open.\n\n\nMoreover, since all these simplified models use roughly the same\nmathematics, why should we think it is surprising that we see the same\npatterns arise over and over again in disparate models? After all, if\nall the traces of processes and interactions\u2014the\ncauses\u2014have been removed from chaos models, as Kellert suggests,\nwhy should it be surprising that chaos models in physics, biology,\neconomics and social psychology exhibit similar behavior? If it really\nboils down to the same mathematics in all the models, then what is it\nwe are actually coming to understand by using these models? On the\nother hand, perhaps chaos studies are uncovering universal patterns\nthat exist in the actual world, not just in mathematics. Identifying\nthese universal patterns is one thing, explaining them is another.\n\n6. Quantum Chaos\n\nQuantum chaos, or quantum chaology as it is better called, is the\nstudy of the relationship between chaos in the macroscopic or\nclassical domain and the quantum domain. The implications of chaos in\nclassical physics for quantum systems have received some intensely\nfocused study, with questions raised about the actual existence of\nchaos in the quantum domain and the viability of the correspondence\nprinciple between classical and quantum mechanics to name the most\nprovocative.\n\n\nBefore looking at these questions, there is the thorny problem of\ndefining quantum chaos. The difficulties in establishing an agreed\ndefinition of quantum chaos are actually more challenging than for\nclassical chaos (\u00a71). Recall that there\nwere several subtleties involved in attempting to arrive at a\nconsensus definition of classical chaos. One important proposal for a\nnecessary condition is the presence of some form of stretching and\nfolding mechanism associated with a nonlinearity in the\nsystem. However, since Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation is linear, quantum\nmechanics is a linear theory. This means that quantum states starting\nout initially close remain just as close (in Hilbert space norm)\nthroughout their evolution. So in contrast to chaos in classical\nphysics, there is no separation (exponential or otherwise) between\nquantum states under Schr\u00f6dinger evolution. The best candidates\nfor a necessary condition for chaos appear to be missing from the\nquantum domain.\n\n\nInstead researchers study the quantization of classical chaotic\nsystems and these studies are known as quantum chaology: \u201cthe\nstudy of semiclassical, but nonclassical, phenomena characteristic of\nsystems whose classical counterparts exhibit chaos\u201d (Berry 1989,\np. 335). It turns out that there are a number of remarkable behaviors\nexhibited by such quantized systems that are interesting in their own\nright. It is these behaviors that raise questions about what form\nchaotic dynamics might take in the quantum domain (if any) and the\nvalidity of the correspondence principle. Moreover, these studies\nreveal further evidence that the relationship between the quantum and\nclassical domains are subtle indeed.\n\n\nResearchers in quantum chaology have focused on universal\nstatistical properties that are independent of the quantum systems\nunder investigation. Furthermore, studies focus on so-called simple\nquantum systems (i.e., those that can be described by a finite number\nof parameters or finite amount of information). The kinds of\nstatistical properties studied in such systems include the statistics\nof energy levels and semi-classical structures of wave\nfunctions. These statistical properties are relevant for quantum state\ntransitions, ionization and other quantum phenomena found in atomic\nand nuclear physics, solid state physics of mesoscopic systems and even\nquantum information. Some typical systems studied are quantum\nbilliards (particles restricted to two-dimensional motions), the\nquantum kicked rotor, a single periodically driven spin and coupled\nspins. Often, iterated maps are used in investigating quantum chaos\njust as in classical chaos (\u00a71.2.5\nabove).\n\n\nBilliards are a particularly well-studied family of models. Think of a\nperfectly flat billiard table and assume that the billiard balls\nbounce off the edges of the table elastically. Such a model table at\nthe macroscopic scale of our experience where the balls and edges are\ncharacterized by classical mechanics is called a classical\nbilliard. Lots of analytic results have been worked out for\nclassical billiards so this is makes billiards a very attractive model\nto study. A chaotic billiard is a classical billiard where the\nconditions lead to chaotic behavior of the balls. There is a wealth of\nresults for chaotic billiards, too. Such analytical and computational\nriches have made quantum versions of billiards workhorses for studying\nquantum chaology as will be seen below. One can produce quantum\nbilliards by using Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation to describe\nparticles reflecting off the boundaries (where one specifies that the\nwave function for the particles is zero at a boundary), or one can\nstart with the equations describe a classical billiard and quantize\nthe observables (e.g., position and momentum) yielding quantized\nbilliards.\n\n\nTo organize the discussion, isolated systems, where the energy spectra\nare discrete, will be treated first followed by interacting systems,\nwhere energy spectra are continuous. Although whether the energy\nspectra are discrete or not is not crucial to quantum chaology,\nwhether a quantum system is isolated or not has been argued to be\npotentially important to whether chaos exists in the quantum realm.\n\n6.1 Does Quantum Chaos Exist? Isolated Systems\n\nOne difference between classical chaotic dynamics and quantum dynamics\nis that the state space of the former supports fractal structure while\nthe state space of the latter does not. A second difference is that\nclassical chaotic dynamics has a continuous energy spectrum associated\nwith its motion. As previously noted, classical chaos is considered to\nbe a property of bounded macroscopic systems. In comparison, the\nquantum dynamics in bounded, isolated systems has a discrete energy\nspectrum associated with its motion. Moreover, phenomena such as SDIC\ncould only be possible in quantum systems that appropriately mirror\nclassical system behaviors. From semi-classical considerations, Berry\net al. (1979) showed that semi-classical quantum systems (see below\nfor how such systems are constructed) could be expected to mirror the\nbehavior of their corresponding classical systems only up to the\nEhrenfest time \\(t_{E}\\), of the order \\(\\ln(2\\pi/h)\\) secs, \nan estimate also known as the log time\nreflecting the exponential instability of classical chaotic\ntrajectories. In these semi-classical studies, \\(h/2\\pi\\) often is\ntreated as a parameter that is reduced in magnitude as the classical\ndomain is approached. On this view, the smaller \\(h/2\\pi\\), the\nmore \u201cclassical\u201d the system\u2019s behavior becomes. For\ninstance, assuming the value of Planck\u2019s constant in KMS\nunits, \\(t_{E} \\sim 80\\) secs. As Planck\u2019s constant\ndecreases, \\(t_{E}\\) grows. In nonchaotic\nclassical systems the orbits in state space are well isolated and\neverything well behaved for very long times. In contrast for bound\nchaotic systems the orbits start coalescing in increasing numbers on\nthe scale of\n\\(t_{E}\\), implying that the semi-classical\napproximation fails by \\(t_{E}\\). On the other\nhand, a Gaussian wave packet centered on a classical trajectory is\nthought to be able to shadow that trajectory up\nto \\(t_{E}\\) before becoming too spread out over\nthe energy surface since \\(t_{E}\\) is a measure\nof when quantum wave packets have spread too much to mimic classical\ntrajectories and the Ehrenfest theorem breaks down. So there are two\neffects at work in semi-classical systems over time: (1) the\ncoalescing of classical chaotic trajectories and (2) the spreading of\nquantum wave packets. Between the lack of nonlinearity in quantum\nmechanics and the latter two effects, things look rather bleak for\nfinding close quantum analogs of classical chaos.\n\n\nWhile \\(t_{E}\\) represents an important limit\nfor how long quantum state vectors can be expected to shadow classical\ntrajectories, there are interesting behaviors in the semi-classical\nquantum models corresponding to classical chaotic systems on longer\ntime scales. By performing some more detailed analysis, Tomsovic and\nHeller (1993) showed that comparing the full quantum solutions with\nsuitably chosen semi-classical solutions for some billiards problems\nprovided excellent agreement well\nafter \\(t_{E}\\) including fine details of the\nenergy spectra. For their techniques semi-classical mechanics remains\naccurate for modeling quantum systems up to a time that scales with\n\\((h/2\\pi)^{-1/2}\\).\n\n\nThe vast majority of these quantum chaology studies focus on three questions:\n\nCan classically chaotic systems be quantized?\nAre there any quantum mechanical manifestations, \n\u201cprecursors,\u201d of classical chaos?\nIs there a rigorous distinction between chaotic and non-chaotic \nquantum systems?[10]\n\n\nThe first two questions focus on different directions of research,\nboth related to what is known as semi-classical mechanics. In the\nfirst, investigation starts with a classical chaotic system and seeks\nto quantize it to study its quantum behavior. To quantize a classical\nmodel, one replaces functions in the equations of motion with their\ncorresponding quantum operators. Here, there are various results\ndemonstrating that strongly ergodic classical billiards, when\nquantized, exhibit quantum ergodicity. But this is not the same as\nshowing that a classical chaotic system, when quantized, exhibits\nchaotic behavior. There are no examples of the latter due to the\nreasons listed at the beginning of this subsection.\n\nFurthermore, there are interesting numerical results on quantum\ninterference in quantized classical billiards (Casati 2005). Consider\na double slit with the source enclosed in a two-dimensional wave\nresonator with the shape of a classical billiard. Adjust the Gaussian\nwave packet\u2019s initial average energy to be one 1600th of an excited\nstate of the quantized billiard and send it toward the double slit\nopening of the resonator. Let the slit width be three De Broglie\nwavelengths, and suppose that the wave packet is sharply peaked in\nmomentum so that its spatial spread, by the Heisenberg relations, is\nthe width of the resonator. If the shape of the resonator corresponds\nto a classical chaotic billiard, then there is almost no\nquantum interference. In the classical case, the multiply reflected\nwaves would become randomized in phase. On the other hand, if the\nshape of the resonator corresponds to a classical regular\nbilliard, then the well-known interference patterns emerge. So\ndepending on whether the classical billiard is chaotic or not\ndetermines whether the quantized quantum analogue exhibits\ninterference.\n\n\nThe second question starts with a quantum system that has some\nrelationship with a classical chaotic system via an appropriate\nsemi-classical limit. The classical-to-quantum direction often follows\nthe pioneering work of Martin Gutzweiller (1971) in quantizing the\nclassical chaotic system. The quantum-to-classical direction is much\nmore difficult and fraught with conceptual problems. Standard\napproaches, here, are to start with a quantum analogue to a classical\nchaotic system and then derive a semi-classical system that represents\nthe quantum system in some kind of classical limit (Berry 1987 and\n2001; Bokulich 2008). This work results in statistics of suitably\nnormalized energy levels for the semi-classical systems with universal\nfeatures. For classical systems that behave non-chaotically, the\nenergy levels of the semi-classical system approximate a Poisson\ndistribution, where small spacings dominate. In contrast when the\nclassical system behaves chaotically, the energy levels of the\nsemi-classical system take on a distribution originally derived by\nEugene Wigner (1951) to describe nuclear energy spectra (for\ndiscussion see Guhr et al. 1998). These latter distributions depend\nonly on some symmetry properties (e.g., the presence or absence of\ntime-reversal symmetry in the\n system).[11]\n Moreover, the presence of periodic orbits\nin the analog classical systems largely determine the properties of\nsemi-classical systems (Berry 1977).\n\n\nInterestingly, many classically chaotic models systems also display\nuniversal energy level fluctuations that are well described by\nWigner\u2019s methods (Casati, Guarneri and Valz-Gris 1980; Bohigas,\nGiannoni and Schmit 1984). This has led to the quantum chaos\nconjecture:\n\n(Quantum Chaos Conjecture)  The short-range\n correlations in the energy spectra of semi-classical quantum systems which are\n strongly chaotic in the classical limit obey universal fluctuation\n laws based on ensembles of random matrices without free parameters.\n\nThis conjecture is motivated by the accumulated evidence over the\ndecades that the energy spectra of very simple non-integrable\nclassically chaotic systems contain universal level fluctuations\ndescribed by random matrix theory. Given random matrix theory\u2019s\nsuccessful application to nuclear spectra and these classical results,\nthe question of whether there were analog results for quantum systems\nwith chaotic systems as an appropriate limit seems reasonable. The\nconjecture basically means that the energy spectra for the semi-classical analogues of classical chaotic systems are structurally the same as those classical systems. This\nconjecture remains unproven, though it appears to hold for the case of\nclassical chaotic billiards and their semi-classical counterparts. Since this is a conjecture about semi-classical systems, this means that the structure of the energy spectra of semi-classical systems is strictly dependent on chaos in the corresponding classical systems  not on any chaotic behavior in quantum or semi-classical systems.\n\nOne can raise serious questions about these quantum-to-classical\nstudies, however. The semi-classical systems are derived using various\nasymptotic procedures (Berry 1987 and 2001), but these procedures do\nnot yield the actual classical systems that are supposed to be the\nlimiting cases of the quantum systems. More importantly, the actual\nkinds of limiting relations between the quantum and classical domains\nare different than are typically considered in semi-classical\napproaches (\u00a76.3 below). The actual\nrelationship between the mathematical results and actual quantum and\nclassical physical systems is tenuous at best leaving us, again, with\nthe worry that chaos is an artifact of the mathematics\n(\u00a75). One of the reasons the quantum\nchaos conjecture remains unproven likely is that inappropriate notions\nof \u201cthe classical limit\u201d are being used. Even though the\nenergy level statistics for quantum billiards in the semi-classical\ncounterparts to classical billiard systems share universal properties,\nthe actual behavior of the trajectories in the two systems is\nsubstantially different (under Schr\u00f6dinger evolution Hilbert \nspace vectors never diverge from one another).\n\n\nAnother fundamental problem is that classical chaos is a function of\nnonlinearities whereas Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation describing quantum\nsystems is linear. Empirical investigation of quantum chaology, hence,\nusually focuses on externally driven quantum systems (see next\nsection) and scattering processes (e.g., quantum billiards). The focus\nin these studies is on the unpredictability of the time evolution of\nsuch systems and processes. Although unpredictability is a feature of\nclassical chaotic systems, there are many reasons why the time\nevolution of quantum systems may be as unpredictable (e.g., if\ncommuting observables undergo complicated dynamics). It is not clear\nthat unpredictability in externally driven quantum systems and\nscattering processes is due to any form of chaos.\n\n\nQuantum systems do sometimes exhibit bifurcations. For instance, rotating\nmolecules under some circumstances will undergo several consecutive\nqualitative changes that are interpreted as bifurcations\n(Zhilinski\u00ed 2001). Whether there is a series of bifurcations in\nsuch systems that could eventually lead to a transition to some form\nof quantum chaotic behavior is currently unknown.\n\n\nAt best, quantum chaology in isolated systems has produced results\nthat have interesting relationships with integrable and non-integrable\nclassical systems and some important experimental results (e.g.,\nBayfield and Koch 1974; Casati, Chirikov, Izrailev and Ford 1979;\nFishman, Grempel and Prange 1982; Casati, Chirikov and Shepelyanski\n1984; Berry 2001). These relationships are all statistical as\nindicated. One issue with studying isolated, closed quantum systems is\nthat the state spaces of these systems do not allow the formation of\nthe state-space structures typically associated with classical chaotic\nsystems. There are some exceptions discussed in the literature, but it\nis actually ambiguous if these are genuine cases of chaos. One example\ndiscussed in the literature is a quantum Hamiltonian operator for\nan \\(N\\)-dimensional torus:\n\\(\\bfrac{1}{2}(g_{k} n_{k} + n_{k} g_{k})\\),\nwhere \\(n_{k} = -i\\partial / \\partial \\theta_{k}, \\theta_{k}\\) \nis an angle variable, and \\(d\\theta_{i} /dt = g_{i}(\\theta_{k})\\)\nfor \\(i, k = 1, 2,3,..., N\\) (Chirikov,\nIzrailev and Shepelyanski 1988, p. 79). The probability density for\nmomentum grows exponentially fast, which seems to parallel SDIC for\ntrajectories in the classical case. Again, it is far from clear that\nthis is chaos; there is no principled reason for considering the\nexponential growth in some quantity as a mark of chaos (recall the\nexample in the first paragraph\nof \u00a71.2.6 above).\n\n\nBuilding on the numerical results of the double-slit/billiard wave\nresonator described above, it may be possible to apply quantum\nchaology to the quantum measurement problem. Typically, models for\nquantum measurement describe the destruction of coherent quantum\nstates as an effect of external noise or the environment. These\nquantum chaology results could allow the development of a dynamical\ntheory of quantum decoherence due to the interaction between a\nclassical chaotic (or at least non-integrable) system and coherent\nquantum states producing the incoherent mixtures observed in\nmeasurement devices. These considerations lead us to interacting systems.\n\n6.2 Does Quantum Chaos Exist? Interacting Systems\n\nThe failure to find the features of classical chaos in quantum systems\nis usually diagnosed as being due to the linear nature of\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation (classical chaos appears to require\nnonlinearity as a necessary condition). And the evidence from isolated\nquantum systems substantiates this diagnosis as just discussed. What\nabout interacting quantum systems (which sometimes get called open\nquantum systems)? At first glance, one can argue that the linearity of\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation implies that nearby quantum states\nwill always remain nearby as they evolve in time. However, some\nalternative possibilities for possible chaotic behavior have been\nproposed for interacting quantum systems.\n\n\nFred Kronz (1998, 2000) has argued that focusing on the\nseparable/nonseparable Hamiltonian distinction is more appropriate\nthan nonlinearity for the question of quantum chaos\n(1.2.7 Taking Stock above). Although\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation is linear, there are many examples\nof nonseparable Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics. A prime example\nwould be the Hamiltonian describing an interaction between a\nmeasurement device and a quantum system. In such situations, the\nquantum system-measurement apparatus compound system can evolve from a\ntensor product state to a nonseparable entangled state represented by\nan irreducible superposition of tensor product states. A second\nubiquitous example would be the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\ncorrelations. Although many, such as Robert Hilborn (1994, 549\u2013569),\nhave argued that the unitary evolution of quantum systems makes SDIC\nimpossible for quantum mechanics, these arguments do not take into\naccount that interacting quantum systems typically have nonseparable\nHamiltonians.\n\n\nFor interacting quantum systems, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation is no\nlonger valid and one typically turns to so-called master equations to\ndescribe evolution (Davies 1976). Such equations typically have\nnonseparable Hamiltonians. In general, the time evolution of the\ncomponents of such interacting systems is not unitary meaning that there is\nno formal prohibition against SDIC. Moreover, an important contrast between\nisolated and interacting quantum systems is that while the former have discrete\nenergy spectra, the latter have continuous spectra. A continuous\nenergy spectrum is characteristic of classical systems. Nevertheless,\nwork in interacting quantum systems largely has only uncovered the same kinds of\nuniversal statistical characteristics of energy spectra and\nfluctuations as found in isolated systems (e.g., Guhr,\nM\u00fcller-Groeling and Weidenm\u00fcller 1998; Ponomarenko, et\nal. 2008; Filikhin, Matinyan and Vlahovic 2011).\n\n\nIt is often the case that the quantum chaology literature uses a\nbroader notion of chaos as behavior that \u201ccannot be described as\na superposition of independent one-dimensional motions\u201d\n(Ponomarenko, et al. 2008, p. 357); in other words, a form of\ninseparability. Still, the chaology in interacting quantum systems looks to\nbe the same as in isolated systems: \u201cQuantum mechanically, chaotic\nsystems are characterized by distinctive statistics of their energy\nlevels, which must comply with one of the Gaussian random ensembles,\nin contrast to the level statistics for the nonchaotic systems\ndescribed by the Poisson distribution\u201d (Ponomarenko, et al.\n2008, p. 357). This is largely due to the fact that quantum chaology\nis closely tied to universal statistical patterns in quantum systems\nthat share some relationship with classical chaotic counterpart\nsystems.\n\n\nOne of the measures used to detect chaotic behavior in classical\nsystems is a positive Kolmogorov entropy, which can be related to\nLyapunov exponents (e.g., Atmanspacher and Scheingraber\n1987). Unfortunately, there are no appropriate analogous for Lyapunov\nexponents in quantum systems. There are alternative entropy measures\nthat could be used, for instance, the von Neumann or\nConnes-Narnhofer-Thirring entropies. However, there are currently many\nopen questions about which, if any, of these entropy measures is the\nappropriate quantum analog (likely they are each appropriate for\nparticular research purposes). Moreover, while these measures have a\nrelationship to the statistics of energy levels and states\ncharacteristic of quantum chaology, there currently are no other known\nfeatures of quantum systems that these measures could relate to\nchaotic behavior observed in classical trajectories.\n\n\nThere is an interesting physical model of a charged particle in a unit\nsquare with periodic boundary conditions with an external\nelectromagnetic field that occasionally gives it a kick (turns on and\noff). Mathematically this model is a generalization of the quantized\nArnold cat map (Arnold and Avez 1968; Weigert 1990; Weigert\n1993). Physically it represents a charged particle confined to an\nenergy surface shaped like a torus that receives kicks from an\nexternal field. The classical model has trajectories that exhibit the\nstretching and folding process that seems to be a necessary condition\nfor chaos, has positive Lyapunov exponents, and is algorithmically\ncomplex[12], one\nof the measures used to detect classical chaos. Its trajectories have\nmany of the marks of chaos. For the quantum model, the kick of the\nelectromagnetic field has the effect of mapping the quantum labels of\nstate vectors that are initially close together to labels which do not\nnecessarily ever come close again. This is somewhat reminiscent of the\ndivergence of classical chaotic trajectories except that it is the\nchange in the state labels that plays the role of the classical\ntrajectories. This leads to an absolutely continuous quasi-energy\nspectrum (the quasi-energy is defined as the set of numbers\nrepresenting the \u201cenergy\u201d in the evolution operator acting on state\nvector labels). The expectation value of the particle position becomes\nunpredictable with respect to the initial state label after long times\nand one can show that the sequence of shifts of the quantum state\nlabels is algorithmically complex. Moreover, a \u201cdistance\u201d\nbetween the labels can be defined that increases exponentially with\ntime.\n\n\nThis is the most convincing example in quantum chaology of behavior\nanalogous to classical chaos. However, there are issues that raise\nquestions about whether the behavior of the sequences of quantum state\nlabels is enough to qualify the system as chaotic. For one thing, the\nquantum chaos conjecture is inapplicable to this system due to the\ncontinuous spectrum of the quasi-energy. More importantly, as pointed\nabout above, exponential divergence is neither necessary nor\nsufficient to characterize a system as chaotic, and neither is\nalgorithmic complexity. There are many examples of systems that are\nalgorithmically complex but are not chaotic. Long randomly generated\nbit strings, no matter how they were obtained, are algorithmically\ncomplex but need not have any relationship to chaos. The behavior of\nthe quantum labels for the kicked particle is irregular to be sure,\nbut the actual temporal evolution of the state vectors is\nalgorithmically compressible, so not irregular in any way.\n\n6.3 The Validity of the Correspondence Principle\n\nThe kind of behavior observed in quantum chaology involves the\nstatistics of energy states in quantum systems that have some kind of\nrelationship to classical chaotic systems (e.g., by quantizing the\nlatter systems). Important features of classical chaos, such as SDIC\nand the period doubling route to chaos, appear to be absent from\nquantum systems. This situation has led to arguments that the\ncorrespondence principle between quantum and classical mechanics fails\nand that the former may be incomplete (Ford 1992).\n\n\nThe correspondence principle can be understood broadly to mean that as\na quantum system system is scaled up to macroscopic size, its behavior should become more like a classical system. Alternatively, the behavior of a quantum model should reproduce the behavior of macroscopic classical models in the limit of large quantum numbers. The correspondence principle is sometimes conceived as letting Planck\u2019s constant\ngo to zero. Nevertheless,\nall these conceptions are terribly inadequate. Since \\(h\\) is a\nconstant of nature, it can never change value, much less go to\nzero. One always has to speak of relevant limits of ratios of the classical to\nquantum actions, for example, which always involve Planck\u2019s\nconstant. Moreover, these limits are singular, meaning\nthat the smooth behavior of a quantity or pattern is disrupted, often\nby becoming infinite (Friedrichs 1955; Dingle 1973; Primas 1998). So\nthere is no straightforward sense in which quantum models become\nincreasingly similar to macroscopic systems as quantum numbers get\nlarge.\n\n\nJoseph Ford offers a different construal of the correspondence\nprinciple: \u201cany two valid physical theories which have an\noverlap in their domains of validity must, to relevant accuracy, yield\nthe same predictions for physical observations.\u201d In the case of\nquantum and Newtonian mechanics, this means that \u201cquantum\nmechanics must, in general agree with the predictions of Newtonian\nmechanics when the systems under study are macroscopic\u201d (1992,\np. 1087). Unfortunately, he gives no discussion of what \u201cdomains\nof validity\u201d mean or in what sense quantum and Newtonian\nmechanics have some overlap in their domains of validity. What he\nclaims in his American Journal of Physics article is that\n\u201cThe very essence of correspondence lies in the notion that\nquantum mechanics can describe events in the macroscopic world without\nany limit taking. Were this not the case, then there would be no\noverlap in the quantal and classical regions of validity\u201d (1992,\np. 1088). Sir Michael Berry is even more direct: \u201call\nsystems,\u201d even our orbiting moon, \u201cobey the laws of\nquantum mechanics\u201d (Berry 2001, p. 42). The upshot for chaos is\nthat \u201cif there is chaos (however defined) in the macroscopic\nworld, quantum mechanics must also exhibit precisely the same chaos,\nelse quantum mechanics is not as general a theory as popularly\nsupposed\u201d (Ford 1992, p. 1088).\n\n\nAs seen above, classical chaotic behavior is not recovered in quantum\nchaology, and this leads to a dilemma: Either the correspondence\nprinciple is false or quantum mechanics is incomplete. Ford, as would\nmost physicists, rejects the first horn of the dilemma. Therefore, the\nproblem must lie with quantum mechanics: Its lack of chaos reveals\nsome incompleteness in the theory. Something is missing.\n\n\nThis dilemma is false, however. The way Ford (and to some degree Berry\namong others) describes things bespeaks a common misconception of the\nrelationship between the quantum and classical domains. Much as he\nmakes of the subtlety of limiting relations\u2014and they are much\nmore subtle than he realizes\u2014his discussion of the\ncorrespondence principle actually turns on an overly simple\nrelationship between the quantum and classical domains. That overly\nsimple relationship presupposes that quantum mechanics fully explains\nclassical phenomena, or, alternatively, that quantum mechanics reduces\nthe classical domain in an appropriate limit. Under such a\npresupposition, if classical chaos either does not exist in quantum\nmechanics or if the latter cannot explain or reproduce classical\nchaos, then it appears that there is some inadequacy with quantum\nmechanics.\n\n\nThe relationship between the quantum and classical domains is\nnontrivial. First, it does not involve a \u201cclassical\nlimit,\u201d but a series of limits of the ratio of quantum\nobservables involving Planck\u2019s constant and other physical\nobservables going to zero (e.g., relevant classical and quantum actions),\nor limits involving the separation of nuclear and electronic frames of\nmotion (in the case of chemistry) among others. All of these limits\ninvolve singular asymptotic series; hence, the relationship between\nquantum phenomena and classical phenomena is not one involving\nanything like bridge laws relating the two domains as Nagelian and\nother forms of reduction would require. There is a change in the\ncharacter of the states and observables going from the quantum to the\nclassical domains (Bishop, 2010b). The classical states and\nobservables are neither a function of nor straightforwardly\nrelated to intrinsic states and observables in quantum mechanics.\n\n\nSecond, even starting with the quantum domain, there are different\nclassical worlds that result from taking these various limits in\ndifferent orders. Since these limits correspond to different physical\ntransitions, changing the order of the limits changes the order of\nphysical transitions yielding physically inequivalent macroscopic\ndomains. Given the physical incompatibility among these different\nmacroscopic worlds, the actual physical transitions between the quantum\nand classical must occur in a particular order to recover the\nclassical domain of our experience.\n\n\nOf course, there is much discussion of the \u201capproximately\nclassical\u201d or \u201cquasi-classical\u201d trajectories for\nquantum systems that can be derived from semi-classical considerations\n(Berry 1987 and 2001). But such quasi-classical behavior is exhibited\nonly for limited times (except for overly idealized models) and under\nvery special initial conditions (Pauli 1933, p. 166) for ground\nstates only (excited energy eigenstates never show classical\nbehavior). Appeal to Ehrenfest\u2019s theorem is of no help, here,\nbecause all this theorem guarantees for such very special, short-lived\ndynamics is that the usual physics practice of averaging the values of\nthe quantum-mechanical observables tends to wash out the errors or\ndifferences between the classical and quantum calculations for\ncontextually relevant situations and times. Moreover, the theorem is\nneither necessary nor sufficient for classical behavior. For instance,\napplying Ehrenfest\u2019s theorem to a quantum harmonic oscillator\nyields average quantities for the position and momentum that track\nwith the classical quantities for some brief time. Yet, the quantum\noscillator\u2019s discrete states yield thermodynamic properties very\ndifferent from a classical oscillator. So satisfying the theorem is\ninsufficient to guarantee classical behavior.\n\n\nThird, the emergence of our classical world is not merely a matter of\nenvironmental decoherence (e.g., Omn\u00e9s 1994; Berry 2001;\nWallace 2012). For one thing, there is no context-free limit of\ninfinitely many degrees of freedom because this limit always has\nuncountably infinitely many physically inequivalent\nrepresentations. Moreover, it is simply false that an improper mixture\nof quantum states \u201callows one to interpret the state of the\n[quantum] system in terms of a classical probability\ndistribution,\u201d such that \u201cit is useful to regard\n\u2018mixed states\u2019 as effectively classical,\u201d so that\n\u201cone can interpret the system described by [a nonpure density\noperator] in terms of a classical \u2018mixture\u2019 with the exact\nstate of the system unknown to the observer\u201d (Zurek 1991,\n46\u201347). Impure quantum states can be interpreted as classical\nmixtures if and only if their components are described by\ndisjoint states. For a classical mixture of two pure states (e.g.,\nwater and oil), the pure states are disjoint if and only if there\nexists a classical observable such that the expectation values with\nrespect to these states are different. It is this disjointness that\nmakes it possible to distinguish states in a classical manner.\n\n\nIn summary, there is nothing in the quantum domain by itself that\ndetermines the character of the classical domain (though the former\nprovides some necessary conditions for the latter). Hence, classical\nchaos, along with many other classical features, is emergent in a more\ncomplex, subtle sense than Ford and others allow. The correspondence\nprinciple must reflect emergent classicality if it is to be a viable\nprinciple, which means that the implicit assumption of reductionism in\nFord\u2019s discussions of quantum chaology should be abandoned. Once the\nreductionist assumption is removed, the disparity between quantum\nchaology and classical chaos no longer calls an appropriately\nformulated correspondence principle into question. This resolves the\nfirst horn of the dilemma.\n\n\nThe second horn of the dilemma likewise is resolved. There is no\nreason to suspect that there is some kind of inadequacy in quantum\nmechanics if features such as chaos are emergent in the classical\ndomain. Neither the generality nor the validity of quantum mechanics\nis in question. Nor does the complex, subtle emergent relationship\nbetween the quantum and classical domains imply that the two domains\nare nonoverlapping or disjoint. Rather, the overlap between the\nquantum and classical is partial and nontrivial. Quantum mechanics is\nuniversally applicable, but this in no way implies that it alone\nuniversally governs classical behavior. It contributes some of the\nnecessary conditions for classical properties and behaviors, but no\nsufficient conditions. One indicator of this is that\nclassical mechanics is formulated in terms of continuous trajectories\nof individual particles through spacetime, while quantum mechanics is\nformulated in terms of probabilities and wave functions. There are\ndeep conceptual differences between the classical and the\nquantum.[13]\nThis suggests that we should not expect individual continuous\ntrajectories to result from quantum mechanics in contextually\ninappropriate limits nor that quantum mechanics should exhibit the full\nrange of classical behaviors, contrary to Ford and others. Instead, we\nshould expect that quantum probabilities recover the classical\nprobabilities in the contextually appropriate situations and that\nthere should be some interesting relationships between quantum and\nclassical properties and behaviors. The interesting statistical\nregularities discovered in quantum chaology fit with this emergent,\nnontrival overlapping relationship nicely.\n\n7. Some Broader Implications of Chaos\n\nThere have been some discussions regarding the wider implications of\nchaos for other domains of philosophical inquiry. Three of the more\nthought-provoking ones will be surveyed here.\n\n7.1 Chaos and Determinism\n\nRecall that mathematically, chaos is a property of dynamical systems\nwhich are deterministic (\u00a71.2.1). Since\nthe 18th century, the best models of and support for metaphysical\ndeterminism were thought to be the determinism of theories and models\nin physics. But this strategy is more problematic and subtle than has\nbeen typically realized (e.g., due to the difficulties with faithful\n models, \u00a73.). So perhaps it is not so\nsurprising that some have argued that chaos reflects some form of\nindeterminism; hence, the world is not metaphysically\ndeterministic. Of course, chaotic systems are notorious for their\nunpredictability, and some such as Karl Popper (1950) have argued that\nunpredictability implies indeterminism. Yet this is to identify\ndeterminism (an ontological property) with predictability (an\nepistemic property).\n\n\nAn example of someone who has pushed the claim that chaotic behavior\nimplies that determinism fails for our word is physicist turned\nAnglican priest, John Polkinghorne: \u201cThe apparently\ndeterministic proves to be intrinsically unpredictable. It is\nsuggested that the natural interpretation of this exquisite\nsensitivity is to treat it, not merely as an epistemological barrier,\nbut as an indication of the ontological openness of the world of\ncomplex dynamical systems\u201d (1989, p. 43). Giving a critical\nrealist reading of epistemology and ontology, Polkinghorne seeks to\nlink the epistemological barrier with an ontological failure of\ndeterminism because of ontological openness to influences not fully\naccounted for in our physics descriptions. Nevertheless, the\nmathematical properties of dynamical systems (e.g., their\ndeterministic character) present a serious problem with this line of\nreasoning. Determinism as unique evolution appears to be preserved in\nour mathematical models of chaos, which serve as our ontic\ndescriptions of chaotic\n systems.[14]\n\n\nWhat would it take to raise questions about the determinism of\nactual-world systems? For nonlinear dynamical systems, their presumed\nconnection with target systems is one place to start. Mathematical\nmodeling of actual-world systems requires distinctions between\nvariables and parameters as well as between systems and their\nboundaries. However, where linear superposition is lost such\ndistinctions become problematic (Bishop 2010a). This situation raises\nquestions about our epistemic access to systems and models in the\ninvestigation of complex systems, but also raises questions about\ninferring the supposed determinism of target systems based on these\nmodels. Moreover, if the system in question is nonlinear, then the\nfaithful model assumption (\u00a71.2.3)\nraises difficulties for inferring the determinism of the target system\nfrom the deterministic character of the model.\n\n\nConsider the problem of the mapping between the model and the target\nsystem. There is no guarantee that this mapping is one-to-one even for\nthe most faithful model. The mapping may actually be a many-to-one\nrelation or a many-to-many relationship. A one-to-one relationship\nbetween a deterministic model and target system would make the\ninference from the deterministic character of our mathematical model\nto the deterministic character of the target system more\nsecure. However, a many-to-one mapping raises problems. One might\nthink this can be resolved by requiring the entire model class in a\nmany-to-one relation be deterministic. Such a requirement is\nnontrivial, though. For instance, it\u2019s not uncommon for different\nmodeling groups to submit proposals for the same project, where some\npropose deterministic models and others propose nondeterministic\nmodels. Nonlinear models render any inferences from physics to\nmetaphysical determinism shaky at best.\n\n7.2 Free Will and Consciousness\n\nA number of authors have looked to quantum mechanics to help explain\nconsciousness and free will (e.g., Compton 1935; Eccles 1970; Penrose\n1991, 1994 and 1997; Beck and Eccles 1992; Stapp 1993; Kane 1996;\n quantum consciousness).\nStill it has been less clear to many that quantum mechanics is relevant\nto consciousness and free will. For example, an early objection to\nquantum effects influencing human volitions was offered by philosopher\nJ. J. C. Smart (1963, \n pp.\u00a0123\u20134).[15]\n Even if indeterminism was true at the quantum level, Smart argued\nthat the brain remains deterministic in its operations because quantum\nevents are insignificant by comparison. After all a single neuron is\nknown to be excited by on the order of a thousand molecules, each\nmolecule consisting of ten to twenty atoms. Quantum effects though\nsubstantial when focusing on single atoms are presumed negligible when\nfocusing on systems involving large numbers of molecules. So it looks\nlike quantum effects would be too insignificant in comparison to the\neffects of thousands of molecules to play any possible role in\nconsciousness or deliberation. \n\nArguments such as Smart\u2019s do not take into consideration the\npossibility for amplifying quantum effects through the interplay\nbetween SDIC at the level of the macroscopic world on the one hand\nand quantum effects on the other (see\n \u00a74).\n SD arguments purport to demonstrate that chaos in classical systems\ncan amplify quantum fluctuations due to sensitivity to the smallest\nchanges in initial conditions. Along these lines suppose (somewhat\nsimplistically) the patterns of neural firings in the brain correspond\nto decision states. The idea is that chaos could amplify quantum\nevents causing a single neuron to fire that would not have fired\notherwise. If the brain (a macroscopic object) is also in a chaotic\ndynamical state, making it sensitive to small disturbances, this\nadditional neural firing, small as it is, would then be further\namplified to the point where the brain states would evolve differently\nthan if the neuron had not fired. In turn these altered neural firings\nand brain states would carry forward such quantum effects affecting\nthe outcomes of human choices. \n\nThere are several objections to this line of argument. First, the\npresence of chaos in the brain and its operations is an empirical\nmatter that is hotly debated (Freeman and Skarda 1987; Freeman 1991,\n2000; Kaneko, Tsuda and Ikegami 1994 pp.\u00a0103\u2013189;\nVandervert 1997; Diesmann, Gewaltig and Aertsen 1999; Lehnertz 2000;\nVan Orden, Holden and Turvey 2003 and 2005; Aihara 2008; Rajan, Abbott\nand Sompolinsky 2010). It should be pointed out, however, that these\ndiscussions typically assume SD or Chaos\\(_{\\lambda}\\) as the\ndefinition of chaos. All that is really needed for sensitivity to and\namplification of quantum effects in the brain is the loss of principle\nof superposition found in nonlinear systems. Second, these kinds of\nsensitivity arguments depend crucially on how quantum mechanics itself\nand measurements are interpreted as well as the status of\nindeterminism (\u00a74). Third, although\nin the abstract sensitivity arguments seem to lead to the conclusion\nthat the smallest of effects can be amplified, applying such arguments\nto concrete physical systems shows that the amplification process may\nbe severely constrained. In the case of the brain, we\ncurrently do no know what constraints on amplification exist. \n\nAn alternative possibility avoiding many of the difficulties exhibited\nin the chaos+quantum mechanics approach is suggested by the research\non far-from-equilibrium systems by Ilya Prigogine and his\nBrussels-Austin Group (Bishop 2004). Their work purports to offer\nreasons to search for a different type of indeterminism in both micro\nand macrophysical domains.\n\n\nConsider a system of particles. If the particles are distributed\nuniformly in position in a region of space, the system is\nsaid to be in thermodynamic equilibrium (e.g., cream uniformly\ndistributed throughout a cup of coffee). In contrast, if the system is\nfar-from-equilibrium (nonequilibrium) the particles are arranged so\nthat highly ordered structures might appear (e.g., a cube of ice floating in\ntea). The following properties characterize nonequilibrium statistical\nsystems: large number of particles, high degree of structure and order,\ncollective behavior, irreversibility, and emergent properties. The\nbrain possesses all these properties, so that the brain can be\nconsidered a nonequilibrium system (an equilibrium brain is a dead\nbrain!).\n\n\nLet me quickly sketch a simplified version of the approach to point\nout why the developments of the Brussels-Austin Group offer an\nalternative for investigating the connections between physics,\nconsciousness and free will. Conventional approaches in physics\ndescribe systems using particle trajectories as a fundamental\nexplanatory element of their models, meaning that the behavior of a\nmodel is derivable from the trajectories of the particles composing the\nmodel. The equations governing the motion of these particles are\nreversible with respect to time (they can be run backwards and forwards\nlike a film). When there are too many particles involved to make these\ntypes of calculations feasible (as in gases or liquids), coarse-grained\naveraging procedures are used to develop a statistical picture of how\nthe system behaves rather than focusing on the behavior of individual\nparticles.\n\n\nIn contrast the Brussels-Austin approach views nonequilibrium\nsystems in terms of nonlinear models whose fundamental explanatory\nelements are distributions; that is to say, the arrangements of the\nparticles are the fundamental explanatory elements and not the\nindividual particles and\n trajectories.[16]\n The equations governing the behavior of these distributions are\ngenerally irreversible with respect to time. In addition focusing\nexclusively on distribution functions opens the possibility that\nmacroscopic nonequilibrium models are irreducibly indeterministic, an\nindeterminism that has nothing to do with ignorance about the\nsystem. If so, this would mean probabilities are as much an\nontologically fundamental element of the macroscopic world as they are\nof the microscopic and are free of the interpretive difficulties found\nin conventional quantum mechanics. \n\nOne important insight of the Brussels-Austin Group\u2019s shift away from\ntrajectories to distributions as fundamental elements is that\nexplanation also shifts from a local context (set of particle\ntrajectories) to a global context (distribution of the entire set of\nparticles). Systems acting as a whole may produce collective effects\nthat are not reducible to a summation of the trajectories and\nsubelements composing the system (Bishop 2004 and 2012). The brain\nexhibits this type of collective behavior in many circumstances (Engel,\net al. 1997) and the work of Prigogine and his colleagues\ngives us another tool for trying to understand that\nbehavior. Moreover, nonlinear nonequilibrium models also exhibit SDIC,\nso there are a number of possibilities in such approaches for very\nrich dynamical description of brain operations and cognitive phenomena\n(e.g., Juarrero 1999; Chemero and Silberstein 2008). Though the\nBrussels-Austin approach to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is\nstill speculative and contains some open technical questions, it\n offers an alternative for exploring the relationship between\nphysics, consciousness and free will as well as pointing to a new\npossible source for indeterminism to be explored in free will\ntheories.\n\n\nWhether approaches applying chaotic dynamics to understanding the\nnature of consciousness and free will represent genuine advances\nremains an open question. For example, if the world is deterministic,\nthen the invocation of SDIC in cognitive dynamics (e.g., Kane 1996)\nmay provide a sophisticated framework for exploring deliberative\nprocesses, but would not be sufficient for incompatibilist\nnotions of freedom. On the other hand, if indeterminism (quantum\nmechanical or otherwise) is operative in the brain, the challenge\nstill remains for indeterminists such Robert Kane (1996) to\ndemonstrate that agents can effectively harness such indeterminism by\nutilizing the exquisite sensitivity provided by nonlinear dynamics to\nground and explain free will. Questions about realism and explanation\nin chaotic dynamics\n (\u00a75)\n are relevant here as well as the faithful model assumption. \n7.3 Human and Divine Action in a Nonlinear World\n\nThere has also been much recent work applying the perspective of\ndynamical systems to cognition and action, drawing explicitly on such\nproperties as attractors, bifurcations, SDIC and other denizens of the\nnonlinear zoo (e.g., van Gelder 1995; Kelso 1995; Port and van Gelder\n1995; Juarrero 1999; Tsuda 2001). The basic idea is to deploy the\nframework of nonlinear dynamics for interpreting neural and cognitive\nactivity as well as complex behavior. It is then hoped that patterns\nof neural, cognitive and human activity can be explained as the\nresults of nonlinear dynamical processes involving causal interactions\nand constraints at multiple levels (e.g., neurons, brains, bodies,\nphysical environments). Such approaches are highly suggestive, but\nalso face challenges. For instance, as mentioned in the previous\nsection, the nature of neural and cognitive dynamics is still much\ndisputed. Ultimately, it is an empirical matter whether these\ndynamics are largely nonlinear or not. Moreover, the explanatory power\nof dynamical systems approaches relative to rival computational\napproaches has been challenged (e.g., Clark 1998). Again, questions\nabout realism and explanation in chaotic dynamics\n (\u00a75)\n are relevant here as well as the faithful model assumption. \n\n Furthermore, Polkinghorne (among others), as previously noted, has\nproposed interpreting the randomness in macroscopic chaotic models and\nsystems as representing a genuine indeterminism rather than merely a\nmeasure of our ignorance (1991, pp.\u00a034\u201348). The idea is\nthat such openness or indeterminism is not only important to the free\nwill and action that we experience (pp.\u00a040\u20131), but also for\ndivine action in the world (e.g., Polkinghorne\n1989; \u00a77.1). In essence the sensitivity to\nsmall changes exhibited by the systems and models studied in chaotic\ndynamics, complexity theory and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics\nis taken to represent an ontological opening in the physical order for\ndivine activity. However the sensitivity upon which Polkinghorne\nrelies would also be open to quantum influences whether deterministic\nor indeterministic. Furthermore, as mentioned previously in\nconnection with the Brussels-Austin program, much rides on whether a\nsource for indeterminism in chaotic behavior can be found. If\nPolkinghorne\u2019s suggestion amounts to simply viewing the world as\nif chaos harbors indeterminism, then it seems that this\nsuggestion doesn\u2019t yield the kind of divine action he\nseeks. \n7. Conclusion\n\nChaos and nonlinear dynamics are not only rich areas for scientific\ninvestigation, but also raise a number of interesting philosophical\nquestions. The majority of these questions, however, remain thoroughly\nunder studied by philosophers.\n\nAppendix: Global Lyapunov Exponents",
