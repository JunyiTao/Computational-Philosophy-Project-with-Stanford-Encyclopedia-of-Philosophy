They are included\nhere for those who wish to have a more complete understanding of what\nFrege in fact attempted to do. They presuppose the material in\n\u00a72. Readers interested in just the positive aspects of\nFrege\u2019s accomplishments should skip directly to \u00a74.]\n\nBefore we examine the powerful consequences that Frege derived from\nHume\u2019s Principle, it is worth digressing to describe his attempt\nto define \u2018\\(\\#F\\)\u2019 explicitly and to derive Hume\u2019s\nPrinciple from Basic Law V. The idea behind this attempt was the\nrealization that if given any concept \\(F\\), the notion of\nequinumerosity can be used to define the second-level concept\nbeing a concept G that is equinumerous to F. Frege found a\nway to collect all of the concepts equinumerous to a given concept\n\\(F\\) into a single extension. In Gl \u00a768, he\ninformally took this to be an extension consisting of first-order\nconcepts by stipulating that the number of \\(F\\)s is the extension of\nthe second-level concept: being a first-level concept equinumerous\nto F.\n\nIn terms of the example used at the end of the previous subsection,\nthis informal definition identifies the number of the concept\nauthor of Principia Mathematica as the extension consisting\nof all and only those first-level concepts that are equinumerous to\nthis concept; this extension has both \\([\\lambda x \\, Axp]\\) and\n\\([\\lambda x \\, 1\\lt x\\lt 4]\\) as members. Frege in fact identifies\nthe cardinal number 2 with this extension, for it contains all and\nonly those concepts under which two objects fall. Similarly, Frege\nidentifies the cardinal number 0 with the extension consisting of all\nthose first-level concepts under which no object falls; this extension\nwould include such concepts as unicorn, centaur,\nprime number between 3 and 5, etc. Frege\u2019s\ninsight here inspired Russell to develop a somewhat similar definition\nin his work, and it is now common to see references to the so-called\n\u201cFrege-Russell definition of the cardinal numbers\u201d as\nclasses of equinumerous concepts or\n sets.[8]\n Of course, this explicit definition of \u2018the number of \\(\nF\\)s\u2019 stands or falls with a coherent conception of\n\u2018extension\u2019. We know that Basic Law V does not offer such\na coherent conception. \n",
