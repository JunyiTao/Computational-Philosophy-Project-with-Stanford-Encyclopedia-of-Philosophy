    "main_text": "Content\n3. Content\n\nIn the normativity debate the main focus has been on meaning: This is\ntrue of the Kripke discussion as well as of earlier discussions\nconcerning the rulishness of language. However, parallel claims have\nalso been made about mental content and recently the thesis that\ncontent is essentially normative has come into focus (McDowell &\nPettit 1986, Brandom 1994, Engel 2000, Boghossian 2003, Gibbard 2003,\nMillar 2004, Jarvis 2012, Hlobil 2015, Miller 2015, Tracy 2020, Green\n 2021).[42]\n\nContent normativism claims that the following is both necessary, and\nessential to, a mental state \\(M\\)\u2018s having a content \\(p\\):\n\n(C)\n\\(M\\) has content \\(p\\) only if there is a rule, or system of\nrules, \\(R\\) in force for\n \\(M.\\)[43]\n\n\nThe relevant notion of content is that of propositional content,\nsomething that can be judged, and the norms in question govern the\n\u201cuse\u201d of concepts. We intend the talk of propositions and\nconcepts in this context to be uncontentious, and not depend on any\nspecific construals of these notions. A proposition, simply, is\nanything that has truth conditions essentially; it is whatever the\npropositional attitudes are attitudes towards. And talking of\n\u201cconcepts\u201d should not be understood as implying a\ncommitment to either structured contents or to a language-like,\nsyntactically structured medium of representation. In this sense, a\nconcept is \u201cused\u201d whenever a subject has an intentional\nmental\n state.[44]\n\nAs in the case of meaning, we distinguish between CE normativity,\nwhich is neutral on the question how content is determined, and CD\nnormativity which takes the norms to be metaphysically primary. We\nshall begin by discussing CE normativity.\n",
