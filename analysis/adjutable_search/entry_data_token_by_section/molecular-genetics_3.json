(Even this modest answer needs to be qualified because RNA\nmolecules are often spliced and edited in ways that affect the linear\nsequence of amino acids in the eventual polypeptide product.) But\nbiologists have offered a far less modest answer as well. The bolder\nanswer is part of a sweeping, fundamental theory. According to this\ntheory, genes are \u201cfundamental\u201d entities that\n\u201cdirect\u201d the development and functioning of organisms by\n\u201cproducing\u201d proteins that in turn regulate all the\nimportant cellular processes. It is often claimed that genes provide\n\u201cthe information\u201d, \u201cthe blueprint\u201d, or\n\u201cthe program\u201d for an organism. It is useful to distinguish\nthis sweeping, fundamental theory about the\nallegedly fundamental role of genes from the modest, basic\ntheory about what genes do with respect to the synthesis of RNA\nand polypeptides.\n",
