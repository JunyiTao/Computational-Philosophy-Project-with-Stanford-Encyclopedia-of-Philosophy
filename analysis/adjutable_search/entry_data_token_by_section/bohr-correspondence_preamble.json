    "main_text": "\n\nRegarding Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle, the historian of\nphysics Max Jammer writes, \u201c[T]here was rarely in the history of\nphysics a comprehensive theory which owed so much to one principle as\nquantum mechanics owed to Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle\u201d\n(Jammer 1966, p. 118). The correspondence principle not only played a\npivotal role in the discovery of quantum mechanics but was also the\ncornerstone of Bohr\u2019s philosophical interpretation of quantum\nmechanics, being closely tied to his better known thesis of\ncomplementarity and to the Copenhagen interpretation.\n\nAlthough the importance of Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle is\nlargely undisputed, there is far less agreement concerning how the\ncorrespondence principle should be defined. It is important to\ndistinguish between Bohr\u2019s own understanding of this principle\nand what it came to mean for the larger physics community. Even if one\nrestricts oneself to Bohr\u2019s writings, however, there is still a\ndisagreement among Bohr scholars regarding precisely which of the\nseveral relations between classical and quantum mechanics that Bohr\ndiscovered should be designated as the correspondence principle. There\nare three primary candidate-definitions in the literature. First,\nthere is the frequency interpretation, according to which the\ncorrespondence principle is a statistical asymptotic agreement between\none component in the Fourier decomposition of the classical frequency\nand the quantum frequency in the limit of large quantum numbers.\nSecond, there is the intensity interpretation according to\nwhich it is a statistical agreement in the limit of large quantum\nnumbers between the quantum intensity, understood in terms of the\nprobability of a quantum transition, and the classical intensity,\nunderstood as the square of the amplitude of one component of the\nclassical motion. Finally, there is the selection rule\ninterpretation, according to which the correspondence principle\nis the statement that each allowed quantum transition between\nstationary states corresponds to one harmonic component of the\nclassical motion.\n\nThe correspondence principle was first articulated in 1913 in the\ncontext of the old quantum theory. Nonetheless, Bohr argued that this\nprinciple survived the replacement of the old quantum theory by modern\nquantum mechanics. The correspondence principle is still referred to\ntoday in the physics literature as a subject of current research,\nthough arguably with a meaning that is somewhat different from\nBohr\u2019s own understanding of this principle. A version of the\ncorrespondence principle also lives on in the philosophical literature\nwhere it has been generalized into a broad methodological principle\n(the generalized correspondence principle) constraining the\ndevelopment of new scientific theories.\n",
