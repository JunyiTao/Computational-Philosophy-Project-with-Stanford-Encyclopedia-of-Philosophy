    "main_text": "\n\nThe relationship between Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) and David\nHume (1711\u20131776) is a source of longstanding fascination. Kant\ncredited Hume with waking him from his \u201cdogmatic slumber\u201d,\nand he describes the Critique of Pure Reason, arguably the\nmost important work of modern philosophy, as the solution to the\n\u201cHumean problem in its greatest possible amplification\u201d\n(Prol 4:260\u201361). Much of the focus has been on their respective\nviews in metaphysics and epistemology. Yet, as Thomas Nagel remarks,\ncontemporary moral philosophy also \u201ccontinues to be dominated by\nthe disagreement between these two giants\u201d (Nagel 2012).\nComparing Hume and Kant therefore provides opportunity to clarify and\nassess two of the modern era\u2019s most influential approaches\nto moral philosophy. Comparing their views also illuminates the\nlandscape of eighteenth-century ethical thought. There are fundamental\ndisagreements between them, but Kant and Hume share some central\nassumptions about morality, and Kant was directly influenced by the\nsentimentalist tradition to which Hume belongs (especially Francis\nHutcheson\u2019s version). The influence was most positive and pronounced\nearly in Kant\u2019s career, but it lingered long after he made a decisive\nbreak with this tradition.\n\nFor the sake of brevity, this article assumes familiarity with\nHume\u2019s and Kant\u2019s main contributions to moral philosophy.\nThe aim here is not to summarize their views or provide an exhaustive\ncomparison. Instead, the task is to examine several key areas where we\ncan reasonably see Kant as responding to or influenced by Hume, or\nwhere comparisons between their views are particularly fruitful.\n",
