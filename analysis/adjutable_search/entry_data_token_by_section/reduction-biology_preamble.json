    "main_text": "\n\nReductionism encompasses a set of ontological, epistemological, and\nmethodological claims about the relations between different scientific\ndomains. The basic question of reduction is whether the properties,\nconcepts, explanations, or methods from one scientific domain\n(typically at higher levels of organization) can be deduced from or\nexplained by the properties, concepts, explanations, or methods from\nanother domain of science (typically at lower levels of organization).\nReduction is germane to a variety of issues in philosophy of science,\nincluding the structure of scientific theories, the relations between\nscientific disciplines, the nature of explanation, the diversity of\nmethodology, and notions of theoretical progress, as well as to\nnumerous topics in metaphysics and philosophy of mind, such as\nemergence, mereology, and supervenience.\n\nQuestions about reduction in biology are pervasive throughout the\nhistory of philosophy and science. Many contemporary debates have\nhistorical analogues that reflect long-standing controversies about\nthe legitimacy of reductionist research strategies and modes of\nexplanation used by different life science subdisciplines. In\nphilosophy of biology, debates about reduction in the second half of\nthe 20th century focused traditionally on the question of whether and\nin what sense classical genetics can be reduced to molecular biology\n(although other strands of discussion were present, such as whether\nevolutionary theory is inherently anti-reductionist because of the\nprinciple of natural selection). Philosophical debates now address a\nwider array of domains beyond genetics (e.g., development, ecology,\nevolution, cell biology, and neuroscience), and include additional\nquestions about the nature and status of interdisciplinarity, such as\nthe integration of data or standards across biological fields.\n\nSection 1 gives an overview of the idea of reduction and how it\nconnects to biological domains and other philosophical issues. Since\ndebates about reductionism have been going on long before recent\ndiscussions in philosophy of biology, Section 2 offers some historical\nbackground. Section 3 reviews the main philosophical accounts of\nreduction in light of their respective motivations and limitations.\nMore general objections to the feasibility or scientific relevance of\nreduction are discussed in Section 4. Because most philosophical\ndiscussions during the past two decades have largely focused on other\nmodels of the structure of scientific knowledge than reduction (e.g.,\nintegration), Sections 5 and 6 concentrate on these recent issues and\ntrends.\n",
