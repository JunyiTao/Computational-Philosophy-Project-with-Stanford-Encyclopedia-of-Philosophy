In particular, there are\ntopological and geometrical (let us lump them together as\n\u201cspatial\u201d) properties of diagrammatic objects and\nrelations which limit the expressive power of diagrammatic systems.\nFor instance, in graph theory it is known that some simple structures\ncannot be drawn in the plane. For example, the graph\nK5 is the graph consisting of 5 nodes, each joined\nto the other by an arc. This graph is non-planar, meaning that it\ncannot be drawn without at least two of the arcs crossing. This is\njust the sort of constraint on possible diagrams that limits the\nexpressive power of diagrammatic systems. Now, since diagrammatic\nreasoning can occur by enumeration of all possible models of a\nsituation, this representational inadequacy (a type of incompleteness)\nrenders many diagrammatic systems incorrect if they are used for\nlogical reasoning (e.g., see the critique of Englebretsen\n 1992\n in Lemon & Pratt\n 1998).\n\nPerhaps the most simple example of this is due to Lemon and\n Pratt[6]\n (see e.g.,\n 1997).\n Consider Euler Circles\u2014where convex regions of the plane\nrepresent sets, and overlap of the regions represents non-empty\nintersection of the corresponding sets. A result of convex topology\nknown as Helly\u2019s Theorem states (for the 2 dimensional case)\nthat if every triple of 4 convex regions has a non-empty intersection\nthen all four regions must have a non-empty intersection.\n\nTo understand the ramifications of this, consider the following\nproblem:\n\nExample 4. Using Euler Circles, represent the\nfollowing premises:\n\n\nA \u2229 B \u2229 C \u2260 \u2205 \n B \u2229 C \u2229 D \u2260 \u2205\n C \u2229 D \u2229 A \u2260 \u2205\n\n\n\nNote that, in terms of set-theory, only trivial consequences follow\nfrom these premises. However, an Euler diagram of the premises, such\nas Figure 5, leads to the incorrect conclusion that\nA\u00a0\u2229\u00a0B\u00a0\n\u2229\u00a0C\u00a0 \u2229\u00a0D\u00a0\n\u2260\u00a0\u2205 (due to the quadruple overlap region in the centre\nof the diagram): \n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: An Euler\u2019s Circles representation exhibiting\nHelly\u2019s Theorem\n\n\nIn other words, a user of Euler Circles is\n forced[7]\n to represent a relationship between the sets which is not logically\nnecessary. This means both that there are logically possible\nsituations which the system cannot represent, and that a user would\nmake incorrect inferences if they relied on the system for reasoning.\nMore generally, this type of result can be generated for many\ndifferent types of diagrammatic system, depending on the particular\nspatial relations and objects which they use in representation\u2014a\nresearch programme which is ongoing.\n\nFor example, using non-convex regions (e.g., \u201cblobs\u201d\ninstead of circles) leads to a similar problem, only that non-planar\ngraphs are involved instead of Helly\u2019s Theorem. A similar result\nconcerns linear diagrams for syllogisms Englebretsen\n 1992,\n where lines are used to represent sets, points represent individuals,\npoint-line intersection represents set-membership, and intersection of\nlines represents set-intersection. Again, planarity constraints\nrestrict the expressive power of the system and lead to incorrect\ninferences.\n\nAtsushi Shimojima\u2019s \u201cconstraint hypothesis\u201d perhaps\nbest sums all this up:\n\nRepresentations are objects in the world, and as such they obey\ncertain structural constraints that govern their possible formation.\nThe variance in inferential potential of different modes of\nrepresentation is largely attributable to different ways in which\nthese structural constraints on representations match with the\nconstraints on targets of representation (Shimojima\n 1996a,\n 1999).\n\n",
