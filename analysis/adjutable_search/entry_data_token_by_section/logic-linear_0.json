    "main_text": "Introduction || A bit of history\n1.1 A bit of history\n\nLinear logic was introduced by Jean-Yves Girard in his seminal work\n (Girard 1987).\n While the origin of the discovery of this new logic comes from a\nsemantical analysis of the models of System F (or polymorphic\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus), one can see the whole system of linear logic as\na bold attempt to reconcile the beauty and symmetry of classical logic\nafforded by De Morgan's dualities with the quest for constructive proofs\nthat had led to intuitionistic logic.\n\nIndeed, one could present a fragment of linear logic, known as\nmultiplicative additive linear logic (MALL), as the outcome\nof two simple observations.\n\nIn the sequent calculus presentation of classical logic, the rules\nfor the connectives \u201cand\u201d and\n\u201cor\u201d, as well as the Cut rule and the rule for\nimplication may be presented equivalently in an additive form (the\ncontext of the premises are the same) or a multiplicative form (the\ncontext of the premises are different). These two presentations are\nequivalent, in classical logic, because of the availability of a few\nso-called \u201cstructural\u201d rules, namely, contraction and\nweakening.\nGentzen's use of the sequent calculus to capture proofs for both\nclassical and intuitionistic logics demonstrated that non-constructive\nproofs made use of one or the other of these structural rules in the\nconclusion (succedent) of sequents.\n\n\nSo, if we want to eliminate the non-constructive proofs without\ndestroying the symmetry of the sequent calculus, as is done in\nintuitionistic logic, we can try to eliminate the contraction and\nweakening rules instead. In doing so, we are left with two different\nversions of each connective: an additive version and a multiplicative\nversion of conjunction and of disjunction. These different versions of\nthe same connecitve are now no longer equivalent. These new\nconnectives are & (\u201cwith\u201d, additive and),\n\\(\\oplus\\) (\u201cplus\u201d, additive or), \\(\\otimes\\)\n(\u201ctensor\u201d, multiplicative and) and \\(\\lpar\\)\n(\u201cpar\u201d, multiplicative or).\n\nThis duplication of the connectives actually leads to a much clearer\nunderstanding of the conflict between classical and intuitionistic\nlogic. For example, the law of excluded middle (\\(A\\) or\nnot-\\(A\\)) is considered valid in the classical world and absurd in\nthe intuitionistic one. But in linear logic, this law has two\nreadings: the additive version \\((A \\oplus \\neg A)\\) is not provable\nand corresponds to the intuitionistic reading of disjunction; the\nmultiplicative version \\((A \\lpar \\neg A)\\) is trivially provable and\nsimply corresponds to the tautology \\((A\\) implies \\(A)\\)\nthat is perfectly acceptable in intuitionistic logic too.\n\nAlso, the disjunction property, essential in constructivism, is easily\nestablished for the additive disjunction.\n\nWe find then inside this richer logic a way to represent both the\nneeds of intuitionism and the elegance of classical logic: negation is\ninvolutive, sequents are symmetric, and connectives are\ninter-definable. Contrast these properties with those of\nintuitionistic logic, where negation is not involutive, sequents are\nnot symmetric, and connectives \\(\\neg, \\wedge, \\vee, \\Rightarrow\\) \nare all not inter-definable.\n\nNotice that once one has eliminated the contraction and\nweakening rules, formulas no longer behave as truth values.  Indeed, if\nwe compose a proof of \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) and a proof of \\(A\\) without\nthese structural rules, we consume them to get a proof of \\(B\\): that\nis, \\(A \\Rightarrow B\\) and \\(A\\) are no longer available after the\ncomposition.  Linear logic formulas behave more like\nresources that can only be used in restricted ways.\n\nTo recover the full expressive power of intuitionistic and classical\nlogic, it is then necessary to add to the MALL fragment two dual\nmodalities, which are usually called exponentials in the\nlinear logic literature. In particular, the \u201cof-course\u201d\nexponential \\(\\bang\\) permits contraction and weakening to be applied\nto the formula \\(\\bang B\\) in the left-hand sequent context while the\n\u201cwhy-not\u201d exponential \\(\\quest\\) permits contraction and\nweakening to be applied to the formula \\(\\quest B\\) on the right-hand\nsequent context. This leads to the full propositional linear logic and\nto a very nice connection with computer science.\n\nNotice that besides MALL, there are two other widely used fragments of\nLinear Logic: Multiplicative Linear Logic (MLL), which is MALL without\nthe additive connectives; and Multiplicative Exponential Linear Logic\n(MELL), which is Linear Logic without the additive connectives. \n\nGentzen's sequent calculus proof system for intuitionistic logic was\nthe result of restricting his sequent calculus for classical logic so\nthat all sequents contained at most one formula on the right-hand side\nof sequents\n (Gentzen 1935).\n Such a single-conclusion restriction can also be explored in the\ncontext of linear logic. Various researchers have considered\nintuitionistic variants of MLL, MALL, and MELL: for example, IMLL\n (Lamarche 1996),\n IMALL\n (Lincoln et al. 1993),\n and IMELL\n (Dal Lago and Laurent 2008).\n Schellinx\n (1991)\n provided some general conservativity results of classical linear\n logic over the corresponding intuitionistic variants: see also\n(Troelstra 1992).\n\nPrior to the introduction of linear logic in 1987, various researchers\nhad been working on various kinds of substructural logic in which not\nall of Gentzen\u2019s structural rules (contraction, weakening, and\nexchange) are accepted. Lambek studied a sequent calculus proof\nsystems in which none of these structural rules were permitted\n (Lambek 1958).\n Other examples of such logics are relevant logic (in which weakening\nis not accepted)\n (Anderson & Belnap 1975, \n  Anderson et al. 1992, \n  Avron 1988,\n  Read 1988). and affine logic (in which contraction is not accepted)\n (Grishin 1981).\n \n",
