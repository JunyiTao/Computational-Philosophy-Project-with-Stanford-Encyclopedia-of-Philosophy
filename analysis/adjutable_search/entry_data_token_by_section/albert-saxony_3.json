    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n4. Impact and Influence\n\nAlbert of Saxony is not a compiler. Even if he shares many ideas with\nthe contemporary masters of arts, he is often original. His teachings\non logic and metaphysics were extremely influential. Although Buridan\nremained the predominant figure in logic, Albert\u2019s\nLogica was destined to serve as a popular text because of its\nsystematic nature and also because it takes up and develops essential\naspects of the Ockhamist position. But it was his commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics that was especially widely read.\nMany manuscripts of it can be found in France and Italy, but also in\nErfurt, Vienna and Prague. Thanks to Albert of Saxony, many new ideas\nraised in Parisian physics and cosmology in the later Middle Ages\nbecame widespread in Central Europe. Albert\u2019s Physics,\nmuch more than Oresme\u2019s and even Buridan\u2019s, basically\nguaranteed the transmission of the Parisian tradition also in Italy,\nwhere it was authoritative along with the works of Heytesbury and John\nDumbleton. His commentary on Aristotle\u2019s De caelo was\nalso influential, eclipsing Buridan\u2019s commentary on this text.\nBlasius of Parma read it in Bologna between 1379 and 1382. A little\nlater, it enjoyed a wide audience at Vienna. His Treatise on\nProportions was often quoted in Italy where, in addition to the\ntexts of Bradwardine and Oresme, it influenced the application of the\ntheory of proportions to motion.\n\nAlbert played an essential role in the diffusion throughout Italy and\ncentral Europe of new ideas discussed in the Mid-Fourteenth century by\nParisian masters, but which were also clearly shaped by Albert\u2019s\nown grasp of English innovations. He manifests an undeniable\noriginality on many topics in logic and physics.\n",
