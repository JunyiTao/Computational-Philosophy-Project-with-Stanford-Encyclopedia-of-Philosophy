    "main_text": "Nonidentity Cases || Historic injustices\n2.5 Historic injustices\n\nThe nonidentity problem raises the issue of whether historic\ninjustices can properly be said to harm, or make things worse for,\npeople who exist today (Sher 2005; Herstein 2008; Cohen 2009;\nSmilansky 2013). According to the nonidentity problem, historic\ninjustices \u2013 including, e.g., U.S. slavery and the Holocaust\n\u2013 lead to the very existence of many of the people whom\nthey have also caused to suffer in various ways. People conceived well\nafter the events themselves take place are thus not, according to the\nnonidentity problem, victims of those events at all, but rather, if\nanything, their beneficiaries. \u201c[H]ow can any person have a\nclaim to compensation for a wrong that was a condition of her\nexistence?\u201d (Cohen 2009, 81) If we think that the taking of\nfunds from presumptively innocent existing and future people so that\nthose funds can be paid in compensation for historic injustices to\nstill other existing or future people can be justified only to the\nextent that those other people really are victims \u2013\nreally have been harmed or damaged or made worse off \u2013 then we\nseem forced to conclude that such takings cannot themselves be\njustified.
