    "main_text": "Post-Fodorian modularity\n3. Post-Fodorian modularity\n\nAccording to the massive modularity hypothesis, the mind is modular\nthrough and through, including the parts responsible for high-level\ncognition functions like belief fixation, problem-solving, planning,\nand the like. Originally articulated and advocated by proponents of\nevolutionary psychology (Sperber, 1994, 2002; Cosmides & Tooby,\n1992; Pinker, 1997; Barrett, 2005; Barrett & Kurzban, 2006), the\nhypothesis has received its most comprehensive and sophisticated\ndefense at the hands of Carruthers (2006). Before proceeding to the\ndetails of that defense, however, we need to consider briefly what\nconcept of modularity is in play. \n\nThe main thing to note here is that the operative notion of modularity\ndiffers significantly from the traditional Fodorian one. Carruthers is\nexplicit on this point:\n\n[If] a thesis of massive mental modularity is to be remotely\nplausible, then by \u2018module\u2019 we cannot mean\n\u2018Fodor-module\u2019. In particular, the properties of having\nproprietary transducers, shallow outputs, fast processing, significant\ninnateness or innate channeling, and encapsulation will very likely\nhave to be struck out. That leaves us with the idea that modules might\nbe isolable function-specific processing systems, all or almost all of\nwhich are domain specific (in the content sense), whose operations\naren\u2019t subject to the will, which are associated with specific\nneural structures (albeit sometimes spatially dispersed ones), and\nwhose internal operations may be inaccessible to the remainder of\ncognition. (Carruthers, 2006, p. 12)\n\n\nOf the original set of nine features associated with Fodor-modules,\nthen, Carruthers-modules retain at most only five: dissociability,\ndomain specificity, automaticity, neural localizability, and central\ninaccessibility. Conspicuously absent from the list is informational\nencapsulation, the feature most central to modularity in Fodor\u2019s\naccount. What\u2019s more, Carruthers goes on to drop domain\nspecificity, automaticity, and strong localizability (which rules out\nthe sharing of parts between modules) from his initial list of five\nfeatures, making his conception of modularity even more sparse\n(Carruthers, 2006, p. 62). Other proposals in the literature are\nsimilarly permissive in terms of the requirements a system must meet\nin order to count as modular (Coltheart, 1999; Barrett & Kurzban,\n2006). \n\nA second point, related to the first, is that defenders of massive\nmodularity have chiefly been concerned to defend the modularity of\ncentral cognition, taking for granted that the mind is modular at the\nlevel of input systems. Thus, the hypothesis at issue for theorists\nlike Carruthers might be best understood as the conjunction of two\nclaims: first, that input systems are modular in a way that requires\nnarrow-scope encapsulation; second, that central systems are modular,\nbut only in a way that does not require this feature. In defending\nmassive modularity, Carruthers focuses on the second of these claims,\nand so will we.\n3.1. The case for massive modularity\n\nThe centerpiece of Carruthers (2006) consists of three arguments for\nmassive modularity: the Argument from Design, the Argument from\nAnimals, and the Argument from Computational Tractability. Let\u2019s\nbriefly consider each of them in turn.\n\nThe Argument from Design is as follows:\n\nBiological systems are designed systems, constructed\nincrementally.\nSuch systems, when complex, need to be organized in a pervasively\nmodular way, that is, as a hierarchical assembly of separately\nmodifiable, functionally autonomous components.\nThe human mind is a biological system, and is complex.\nTherefore, the human mind is (probably) massively modular in its\norganization. (Carruthers, 2006, p. 25)\n\n\nThe crux of this argument is the idea that complex biological systems\ncannot evolve unless they are organized in a modular way, where\nmodular organization entails that each component of the system (that\nis, each module) can be selected for change independently of the\nothers. In other words, the evolvability of the system as a whole\nrequires the independent evolvability of its parts. The problem with\nthis assumption is twofold (Woodward & Cowie, 2004). First, not\nall biological traits are independently modifiable. Having two lungs,\nfor example, is a trait that cannot be changed without changing other\ntraits of an organism, because the genetic and developmental\nmechanisms underlying lung numerosity causally depend on the genetic\nand developmental mechanisms underlying bilateral symmetry. Second,\nthere appear to be developmental constraints on neurogenesis which\nrule out changing the size of one brain area independently of the\nothers. This in turn suggests that natural selection cannot modify\ncognitive traits in isolation from one another, given that evolving\nthe neural circuitry for one cognitive trait is likely to result in\nchanges to the neural circuitry for other traits. \n\nA further worry about the Argument from Design concerns the gap\nbetween its conclusion (the claim that the mind is massively modular\nin organization) and the hypothesis at issue (the claim that\nthe mind is massively modular simpliciter). The worry is this.\nAccording to Carruthers, the modularity of a system implies the\npossession of just two properties: functional dissociability and\ninaccessibility of processing to external monitoring. Suppose that a\nsystem is massively modular in organization. It follows from the\ndefinition of modular organization that the components of the system\nare functionally autonomous and separately modifiable. Though\nfunctional autonomy guarantees dissociability, it\u2019s not clear\nwhy separate modifiability guarantees inaccessibility to external\nmonitoring. According to Carruthers, the reason is that \u201cif the\ninternal operations of a system (e.g., the details of the algorithm\nbeing executed) were available elsewhere, then they couldn\u2019t be\naltered without some corresponding alteration being made in the system\nto which they are accessible\u201d (Carruthers, 2006, p. 61). But\nthis is a questionable assumption. On the contrary, it seems plausible\nthat the internal operations of one system could be accessible to a\nsecond system in virtue of a monitoring mechanism that functions the\nsame way regardless of the details of the processing being monitored.\nAt a minimum, the claim that separate modifiability entails\ninaccessibility to external monitoring calls for more justification than\nCarruthers offers. \n\nIn short, the Argument from Design is susceptible to a number of\nobjections. Fortunately, there\u2019s a slightly stronger argument in\nthe vicinity of this one, due to Cosmides and Tooby (1992). It goes\nlike this: \n\nThe human mind is a product of natural selection.\nIn order to survive and reproduce, our human ancestors had to\nsolve a number of recurrent adaptive problems (finding food, shelter,\nmates, etc.).\nSince adaptive problems are solved more quickly, efficiently, and\nreliably by modular systems than by non-modular ones, natural\nselection would have favored the evolution of a massively modular\narchitecture.\nTherefore, the human mind is (probably) massively modular.\n\n\nThe force of this argument depends chiefly on the strength of the\nthird premise. Not everyone is convinced, to put it mildly (Fodor,\n2000; Samuels, 2000; Woodward & Cowie, 2004). First, the premise\nexemplifies adaptationist reasoning, and adaptationism in the\nphilosophy of biology has more than its share of critics. Second, it\nis doubtful whether adaptive problem-solving in general is easier to\naccomplish with a large collection of specialized problem-solving\ndevices than with a smaller collection of general problem-solving\ndevices with access to a library of specialized programs (Samuels,\n2000). Hence, insofar as the massive modularity hypothesis postulates\nan architecture of the first sort\u2014as evolutionary\npsychologists\u2019 \u2018Swiss Army knife\u2019 metaphor of the\nmind implies (Cosmides & Tooby, 1992)\u2014the premise seems\nshaky. \n\nA related argument is the Argument from Animals. Unlike the Argument\nfrom Design, this argument is never explicitly stated in Carruthers\n(2006). But here is a plausible reconstruction of it, due to Wilson\n(2008):\n\nAnimal minds are massively modular.\nHuman minds are incremental extensions of animal minds.\nTherefore, the human mind is (probably) massively modular.\n\n\nUnfortunately for friends of massive modularity, this argument, like\nthe argument from design, is vulnerable to a number of objections\n(Wilson, 2008). We\u2019ll mention two of them here. First,\nit\u2019s not easy to motivate the claim that animal minds are\nmassively modular in the operative sense. Though\nCarruthers (2006) goes to heroic lengths to do so, the evidence he\ncites\u2014e.g., for the domain specificity of animal learning\nmechanisms, \u00e0 la Gallistel, 1990\u2014adds up to less than\nwhat\u2019s needed. The problem is that domain specificity is not sufficient for Carruthers-style modularity; indeed, it is not even one of the central characteristics of modularity in Carruthers\u2019 account. So the argument falters at the first step. Second, even if animal minds are\nmassively modular, and even if single incremental extensions of the\nanimal mind preserve that feature, it\u2019s quite possible that a\nseries of such extensions of animal minds might have led to its loss.\nIn other words, as Wilson (2008) puts it, it can\u2019t be assumed\nthat the conservation of massive modularity is transitive. And without\nthis assumption, the argument from animals can\u2019t go through.\n\nFinally, we have the Argument from Computational Tractability\n(Carruthers, 2006, pp. 44\u201359). For the purposes of this\nargument, we assume that a mental process is computationally tractable\nif it can be specified at the algorithmic level in such a way that the\nexecution of the process is feasible given time, energy, and other\nresource constraints on human cognition (Samuels, 2005). We also\nassume that a system is encapsulated if in the course of its\noperations the system lacks access to at least some information\nexogenous to it.\n\nThe mind is computationally realized.\nAll computational mental processes must be tractable.\nTractable processing is possible only in encapsulated systems.\n\nHence, the mind must consist entirely of encapsulated\nsystems.\nHence, the mind is (probably) massively modular.\n\n\nThere are two problems with this argument, however. The first problem\nhas to do with the third premise, which states that tractability\nrequires encapsulation, that is, the inaccessibility of at least some\nexogenous information to processing. What tractability actually\nrequires is something weaker, namely, that not all information is\naccessed by the mechanism in the course of its operations (Samuels,\n2005). In other words, it is possible for a system to have unlimited\naccess to a database without actually accessing all of its contents.\nThough tractable computation rules out exhaustive search, for example,\nunencapsulated mechanisms need not engage in exhaustive search, so\ntractability does not require encapsulation. The second problem with\nthe argument concerns the last step. Though one might reasonably\nsuppose that modular systems must be encapsulated, the converse\ndoesn\u2019t follow. Indeed, Carruthers (2006) makes no mention of\nencapsulation in his characterization of modularity, so it\u2019s\nunclear how one is supposed to get from a claim about pervasive\nencapsulation to a claim about pervasive modularity. \n\nAll in all, then, compelling general arguments for massive modularity\nare hard to come by. This is not yet to dismiss the possibility of\nmodularity in high-level cognition, but it invites skepticism,\nespecially given the paucity of empirical evidence directly supporting\nthe hypothesis (Robbins, 2013). For example, it has been suggested\nthat the capacity to think about social exchanges is subserved by a\ndomain-specific, functionally dissociable, and innate mechanism (Stone\net al., 2002; Sugiyama et al., 2002). However, it appears that\ndeficits in social exchange reasoning do not occur in isolation, but\nare accompanied by other social-cognitive impairments (Prinz, 2006).\nSkepticism about modularity in other areas of central cognition, such\nas high-level mindreading, also seems to be the order of the day\n(Currie & Sterelny, 2000). The type of mindreading impairments\ncharacteristic of Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism, for\nexample, co-occur with sensory processing and executive function\ndeficits (Frith, 2003). In general, there is little in the way of\nneuropsychological evidence to support the idea of high-level\nmodularity. \n3.2. Doubts about massive modularity\n\nJust as there are general theoretical arguments for massive\nmodularity, there are general theoretical arguments against it. One\nargument takes the form of what Fodor (2000) calls the \u2018Input\nProblem\u2019. The problem is this. Suppose that the architecture of\nthe mind is modular from top to bottom, and the mind consists entirely\nof domain-specific mechanisms. In that case, the outputs of each\nlow-level (input) system will need to be routed to the appropriately\nspecialized high-level (central) system for processing. But that\nrouting can only be accomplished by a domain-general, non-modular\nmechanism\u2014contradicting the initial supposition. In response to\nthis problem, Barrett (2005) argues that processing in a massively\nmodular architecture does not require a domain-general routing device\nof the sort envisaged by Fodor. An alternative solution, Barrett\nsuggests, involves what he calls \u2018enzymatic computation\u2019.\nIn this model, low-level systems pool their outputs together in a\ncentrally accessible workspace where each central system is\nselectively activated by outputs that match its domain, in much the\nsame way that enzymes selectively bind with substrates that match\ntheir specific templates. Like enzymes, specialized computational\ndevices at the central level of the architecture accept a restricted\nrange of inputs (analogous to biochemical substrates), perform\nspecialized operations on that input (analogous to biochemical\nreactions), and produce outputs in a format useable by other\ncomputational devices (analogous to biochemical products). This\nobviates the need for a domain-general (hence,\nnon-modular) mechanism to mediate between low-level and high-level\nsystems. \n\nA second challenge to massive modularity is posed by the \u2018Domain\nIntegration Problem\u2019 (Carruthers, 2006). The problem here is\nthat reasoning, planning, decision making, and other types of\nhigh-level cognition routinely involve the production of conceptually\nstructured representations whose content crosses domains. This means\nthat there must be some mechanism for integrating representations from\nmultiple domains. But such a mechanism would be domain general rather\nthan domain specific, and hence, non-modular. Like the Input Problem,\nhowever, the Domain Integration Problem is not insurmountable. One\npossible solution is that the language system has the capacity to play\nthe role of content integrator in virtue of its capacity to transform\nconceptual representations that have been linguistically encoded\n(Hermer & Spelke, 1996; Carruthers, 2002, 2006). On this view,\nlanguage is the vehicle of domain-general thought. \n\nEmpirical objections to massive modularity take a variety of forms. To\nstart with, there is neurobiological evidence of developmental\nplasticity, a phenomenon that tells against the idea that brain\nstructure is innately specified (Buller, 2005; Buller and Hardcastle,\n2000). However, not all proponents of massive modularity insist that\nmodules are innately specified (Carruthers, 2006; Kurzban, Tooby, and\nCosmides, 2001). Furthermore, it\u2019s unclear to what extent the\nneurobiological record is at odds with nativism, given the evidence\nthat specific genes are linked to the normal development of cortical\nstructures in both humans and animals (Machery & Barrett, 2008;\nRamus, 2006). \n\nAnother source of evidence against massive modularity comes from\nresearch on individual differences in high-level cognition (Rabaglia,\nMarcus, & Lane, 2011). Such differences tend to be strongly\npositively correlated across domains\u2014a phenomenon known as the\n\u2018positive manifold\u2019\u2014suggesting that high-level\ncognitive abilities are subserved by a domain-general mechanism,\nrather than by a suite of specialized modules. There is, however, an\nalternative explanation of the positive manifold. Since post-Fodorian\nmodules are allowed to share parts (Carruthers, 2006), the\ncorrelations observed may stem from individual differences in the\nfunctioning of components spanning multiple domain-specific\nmechanisms. \n4. Modularity and philosophy\n\nInterest in modularity is not confined to cognitive science and the\nphilosophy of mind; it extends well into a number of allied fields. In\nepistemology, modularity has been invoked to defend the legitimacy of\na theory-neutral type of observation, and hence the possibility of\nsome degree of consensus among scientists with divergent theoretical\ncommitments (Fodor, 1984). The ensuing debate on this issue\n(Churchland, 1988; Fodor, 1988; McCauley & Henrich, 2006) holds\nlasting significance for the general philosophy of science,\nparticularly for controversies regarding the status of scientific\nrealism. Relatedly, evidence of the cognitive penetrability of\nperception has given rise to worries about the justification of\nperceptual beliefs (Siegel, 2012; Stokes, 2012). In ethics, evidence\nof this sort has been used to cast doubt on ethical intuitionism as an\naccount of moral epistemology (Cowan, 2014). In philosophy of\nlanguage, modularity has figured in theorizing about linguistic\ncommunication, for example, in relevance theorists\u2019 suggestion\nthat speech interpretation, pragmatic warts and all, is a modular\nprocess (Sperber & Wilson, 2002). It has also been used demarcate\nthe boundary between semantics and pragmatics, and to defend a notably\naustere version of semantic minimalism (Borg, 2004). Though the\nsuccess of these deployments of modularity theory is subject to\ndispute (e.g., see Robbins, 2007, for doubts about the modularity of\nsemantics), their existence testifies to the relevance of the concept\nof modularity to philosophical inquiry in a variety of domains.",
