    "main_text": "The Existence and Grounds of Human Rights || How Can Human Rights Exist?\n2.1 How Can Human Rights Exist?\n\nA philosophical question about human rights that occurs to many people\nis how it is possible for such rights to exist. Several possible ways\nare explored in this section.\n\nThe most obvious way in which human rights come into existence is as\nnorms of national and international law that are created by enactment,\ncustom, and judicial decisions. At the international level, human\nrights norms exist because of treaties that have turned them into\ninternational law. For example, the human right not to be held in\nslavery or servitude in Article 4 of the\n European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n (Council of Europe, 1950) and in Article 8 of the\n International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n (UN 1966) exists because these treaties establish it. At the national\nlevel, human rights norms exist because they have through legislative\nenactment, judicial decision, or custom become part of a\ncountry\u2019s law. For example, the right against slavery exists in\nthe United States because the\n 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n prohibits slavery and servitude. When rights are embedded in\ninternational law we speak of them as human rights; but when they are\nenacted in national law we more frequently describe them as civil or\nconstitutional rights. \n\nEnactment in national and international law is clearly one of the ways\nin which human rights exist. But many have suggested that this cannot\nbe the only way. If human rights exist only because of enactment,\ntheir availability is contingent on domestic and international\npolitical developments. Many people have looked for a way to support\nthe idea that human rights have roots that are deeper and less subject\nto human decisions than legal enactment. One version of this idea is\nthat people are born with rights, that human rights are somehow innate\nor inherent in human beings (see Morsink 2009). One way that a\nnormative status could be inherent in humans is by being God-given.\nThe\n U.S. Declaration of Independence\n (1776) claims that people are \u201cendowed by their Creator\u201d\nwith natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. On\nthis view, God, the supreme lawmaker, enacted some basic human\nrights.\n\nRights plausibly attributed to divine decree must be very general and\nabstract (life, liberty, etc.) so that they can apply to thousands of\nyears of human history, not just to recent centuries. But contemporary\nhuman rights are specific and many of them presuppose contemporary\ninstitutions (e.g., the right to a fair trial and the right to\neducation). Even if people are born with God-given natural rights, we\nneed to explain how to get from those general and abstract rights to\nthe specific rights found in contemporary declarations and\ntreaties.\n\nAttributing human rights to God\u2019s commands may give them a\nsecure status at the metaphysical level, but in a very diverse world\nit does not make them practically secure. Billions of people do not\nbelieve in the God of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. If people do\nnot believe in God, or in the sort of god that prescribes rights, and\nif you want to base human rights on theological beliefs you must\npersuade these people of a rights-supporting theological view. This is\nlikely to be even harder than persuading them of human rights. Legal\nenactment at the national and international levels provides a far more\nsecure status for practical purposes.\n\nHuman rights could also exist independently of legal enactment by\nbeing part of actual human moralities. All human groups seem to have\nmoralities in the sense of imperative norms of interpersonal behavior\nbacked by reasons and values. These moralities contain specific norms\n(for example, a prohibition of the intentional murder of an innocent\nperson) and specific values (for example, valuing human life.) If\nalmost all human groups have moralities containing norms prohibiting\nmurder, these norms could partially constitute the human right to\nlife.\n\nThe view that human rights are norms found in all human moralities is\nattractive but has serious difficulties. Although worldwide acceptance\nof human rights has been increasing rapidly in recent decades (see\n 4. Universal Human Rights in a World of Diverse Beliefs and Practices),\n worldwide moral unanimity about human rights does not exist. Human\nrights declarations and treaties are intended to change existing\nnorms, not just describe the existing moral consensus. \n\nYet another way of explaining the existence of human rights is to say\nthat they exist most basically in true or justified ethical outlooks.\nOn this account, to say that there is a human right against torture is\nmainly to assert that there are strong reasons for believing that it\nis always morally wrong to engage in torture and that protections\nshould be provided against it. This approach would view the Universal\nDeclaration as attempting to formulate a justified political morality\nfor the whole planet. It was not merely trying to identify a\npreexisting moral consensus; it was rather trying to create a\nconsensus that could be supported by very plausible moral and\npractical reasons. This approach requires commitment to the\nobjectivity of such reasons. It holds that just as there are reliable\nways of finding out how the physical world works, or what makes\nbuildings sturdy and durable, there are ways of finding out what\nindividuals may justifiably demand of each other and of governments.\nEven if unanimity about human rights is currently lacking, rational\nagreement is available to humans if they will commit themselves to\nopen-minded and serious moral and political inquiry. If moral reasons\nexist independently of human construction, they can\u2014when\ncombined with true premises about current institutions, problems, and\nresources\u2014generate moral norms different from those currently\naccepted or enacted. The Universal Declaration seems to proceed on\nexactly this assumption (see Morsink 2009). One problem with this view\nis that existence as good reasons seems a rather thin form of\nexistence for human rights. But perhaps we can view this thinness as a\npractical rather than a theoretical problem, as something to be\nremedied by the formulation and enactment of legal norms. The best\nform of existence for human rights would combine robust legal\nexistence with the sort of moral existence that comes from widespread\nacceptance based on strong moral and practical reasons.\n",
