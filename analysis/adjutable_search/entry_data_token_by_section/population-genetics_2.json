    "main_text": "Population-Genetic Models of Evolution\n3. Population-Genetic Models of Evolution\n\nEvolutionary biologists often define \u2018evolution\u2019 as any\nchange in a population\u2019s genetic composition over time. The\nrationale for this definition is the idea that all other aspects of\nevolution, e.g., the spread of novel phenotypic traits and the\nformation of new species, stem ultimately from changes in gene\nfrequencies within populations. The four factors that can bring about\nsuch a change are: natural selection, mutation, random genetic drift,\nand migration into or out of the population. (A fifth\nfactor\u2014changes to the mating pattern\u2014can change the\ngenotype but not the gene frequencies; many\ntheorists would not count this as an evolutionary change.) A brief\nintroduction to the standard population-genetic treatment of each of\nthese factors is given below.\n",
