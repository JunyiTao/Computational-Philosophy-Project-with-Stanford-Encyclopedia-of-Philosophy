    "main_text": "Local contexts and the dynamic turn\n4. Local contexts and the dynamic turn\n\nIn static theories of meaning, such as the trivalent accounts of\npresupposition discussed above, when a sentence is interpreted in a\ngiven context, every expression in that sentence is interpreted\nrelative to that same context. In dynamic theories of meaning, the\ncontext is allowed to change as a sentence is interpreted. The\nearliest and perhaps still clearest motivation for this dynamism is\nwhat might be termed the anaphoric asymmetry. The anaphoric\nasymmetry consists in pronouns across languages being usually resolved\nto expressions that have already occurred, and only being resolved\ncataphorically to expressions that occur later in the sentence in\nquite special configurations. The dynamic explanation for this is that\npronouns are resolved to referents via the context, and that the\ncontext is updated during processing so that it typically only\ncontains information about things that have already been mentioned.\nThe question might then be asked: how does the processing of anaphora\nrelate to the processing of presuppositions? It turns out that there\nare remarkably strong parallels between phenomena involving anaphora\nand presupposition, and this in turn provides a motivation for\nconsidering not only anaphora but also presupposition to be an\nintrinsically dynamic phenomenon. In this section, we will first study\nthe parallels between presupposition and anaphora, seen as a possible\nmotivation for considering context change in analyzing presupposition,\nand then describe in largely historical terms the sequence of\ndevelopments that led to contemporary dynamic theories.\n",
