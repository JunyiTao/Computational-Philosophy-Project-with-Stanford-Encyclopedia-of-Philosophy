    "main_text": "Educational method\n5. Educational method\n\nEpictetus draws a sharp distinction between book learning, i.e.\nmastering the content of particular treatises, and what may be called\neducation for living, in which one acquires the attitudes and habits\nthat enable correct behavior. The latter is of paramount importance;\nthe former may be of instrumental value but if overemphasized may\nprove a hindrance to ethical development.\n\nThe program of study offered in the school at Nicopolis included the\nreading of philosophical treatises by Stoic authors of the Hellenistic\nperiod, for instance the work On Impulse by Chrysippus\n(1.4.14) and the logical writings of Archedemus (1.10.8). Frequent\nreferences to formal logical schemata suggest that these, too, were\ntaught, as they had been in the curriculum of Musonius Rufus,\nEpictetus\u2019s own teacher at Rome (1.7.32; cf. 1.7.5\u201312).\nFinally, there is some evidence for instruction in what the ancients\ncalled physics (philosophy of nature); for this, see 1.6.19\u201322\nwith Magrin (2012).\n\nEducation for living is primarily self-education, a function of that\ncapacity for self-correction which is inherent in our rational nature.\nEpictetus rejects the way of thinking that says moral improvement is\nachievable only by divine assistance.\n\nHave you not hands, fool? Has not god made them for you? Sit down now\nand pray your nose may not run! Wipe it, rather, and do not blame god.\n(2.16.11)\n\n\nThe example of Socrates serves to remind the hearer that intellectual\nindependence remains the primary objective. For while Socrates teaches\nothers, he is himself untaught or rather self-taught; his unshakeable\ncomprehension of ethical issues has been attained through rigorous\napplication of methods anyone might use. Admittedly, Socrates was\nexceptionally gifted, and yet his achievement is what all are born for\nand can at least hope to match (1.2.33\u201337).\n\nDirect coaching by a philosophical teacher may nonetheless be of\nassistance to persons seeking to correct their own dispositions.\nEpictetus explains the process in Discourses 3.2. Above all,\none must attend to \u201cdesire and aversion\u201d: one must correct\none\u2019s emotional responses by pondering questions of value and\nindifference, for desire or fear of objects outside one\u2019s own\ncontrol results in a host of strong emotions that make one\n\u201cincapable of listening to reason\u201d while experiencing\nthem. Further, one must study \u201cthe impulse to act and not to\nact,\u201d for vigorous action may be part of proper relations to the\ngods, to family members, and to the state, and those actions should be\norderly and well-considered. Finally, one must attend to one\u2019s\nown reasoning processes, to \u201cfreedom from deception and hasty\njudgment and in general whatever is concerned with assent.\u201d This\nlast entails some study of logic, to prevent the conclusions reached\nin the two principal areas of study from being dislodged \u201ceven\nin dreams or drunkenness or melancholy.\u201d\n\nThese three topics have rightly been regarded as the foundation of\nEpictetus\u2019s educational system, although (pace Hadot (1978)),\nthey are not to be identified with the three divisions of\nphilosophical discourse discussed by the early Stoics (viz. physics,\nethics, and logic; Diogenes Laertius 7.39\u201340). As presented in\n3.2, the schema seems intended primarily to deemphasize the role of\nlogic; that is, of the sterile conundrums and oversubtle analyses\nenjoyed by some of Epictetus\u2019s contemporaries. As Barnes (1997)\nhas shown, however, Epictetus is not at all averse to the study of\nlogic provided it is given its proper supporting role. Learning of\nthis kind may be instrumental in developing one\u2019s intellectual\nacumen, just as the weights used by athletes in their training serve\nto develop the muscles (1.4.13; 1.17).\n\nThe actual process of self-improvement is initially a matter of\nconsciously slowing down one\u2019s thought processes to allow for\nreflection prior to assent. \u201cImpression, wait for me a little.\nLet me see what you are, and what you represent\u201d (2.18.24). As\nthe habit of screening impressions becomes established, correct\nresponses will begin to come automatically. Yet constant vigilance is\nstill required, to guard against backsliding (4.3). One can never rely\nsolely on habituation.\n\nMore specific therapeutic techniques may also be of use to the one\nmaking ethical progress. Epictetus recommends that pupils refrain from\nusing the terms \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad,\u201d not because\nthose terms have no application in human life, but because they are\ntoo easily misapplied. Thus one should \u201csuppress\u201d desire\nand aversion, and use only plain, emotionally unadorned impulse and\ncounter-impulse (Encheiridion 2). To combat some individual\nbad habit, one should practice the opposite behavior: for instance, if\none is quick tempered, one should accustom oneself to bearing insults\nwith patience (3.12.6\u201312). Regular self-examination at\nbedtime\u2014a practice borrowed from the Pythagorean\ntradition\u2014will enable one to correct errors before they become\ningrained (3.10.1).\n\nOccasionally Epictetus offers pre-professional advice to pupils who\nintend to pursue a teaching career of their own. He chastises the\nteacher who assigns a technical treatise in logic without providing\nany preliminary training or assessing the pupil\u2019s capabilities\n(1.23.13). In Discourses 3.23.33 he distinguishes three\n\u201cmodes\u201d or \u201ccharacters\u201d of philosophical\ndiscourse. The \u201cprotreptic\u201d mode is that which convinces\nhearers, singly or in groups, to care about philosophical study as a\nmeans toward personal ethical development. The \u201celenctic\u201d\nmode, named from the Socratic elenchos, is more\nconfrontational and is aimed at removing false convictions, while the\n\u201cinstructional\u201d mode imparts sound doctrines. As Long\n(2002) has noted, the three modes are associated respectively with\nDiogenes the Cynic, with Socrates, and with Zeno of Citium, the\nfounder of the Stoic school (3.21.19; cf. 2.12.5).\n",
