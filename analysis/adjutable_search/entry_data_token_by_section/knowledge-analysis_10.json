    "main_text": "Doing Without Justification?\n6. Doing Without Justification?\n\nAs we have seen, one motivation for including a justification\ncondition in an analysis of knowledge was to prevent lucky guesses\nfrom counting as knowledge. However, the Gettier problem shows that\nincluding a justification condition does not rule out all\nepistemically problematic instances of luck. Consequently, some\nepistemologists have suggested that positing a justification condition\non knowledge was a false move; perhaps it is some other condition that\nought to be included along with truth and belief as components of\nknowledge. This kind of strategy was advanced by a number of authors\nfrom the late 1960s to the early 1980s, although there has been\nrelatively little discussion of it\n since.[22]\n Kornblith 2008 provides a notable exception.\n",
