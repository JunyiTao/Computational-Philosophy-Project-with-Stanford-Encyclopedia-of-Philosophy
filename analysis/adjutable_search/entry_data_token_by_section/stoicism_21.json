    "main_text": "Ethics\n4. Ethics\n\nStoic ethics is eudaimonist in structure, in the sense that it posits\nhappiness (eudaimonia) \u2013 a well-lived, flourishing life\n\u2013 as the rational agent\u2019s ultimate practical goal or end\n(telos). Thus the Stoics characterize happiness as \u201cthe\nend, for the sake of which everything is done, but which is not itself\ndone for the sake of anything\u201d else (Stobaeus, 63A). This core\neudaimonist thesis is shared by the Epicureans, Peripatetics, and\nother philosophical schools contemporary with the Stoics, and is\nregarded as an uncontroversial starting-point for further ethical\nreflection and theorizing (Annas 1993). Every human agent, it is\nassumed, wants nothing more than to live a flourishing, happy life and\ntherefore arranges their own projects and efforts according to what\nthey think will accomplish this goal. Unfortunately, however, most\nhuman beings are mistaken about what will in fact make them happy.\nRegardless of what they themselves might say about the value and\nsuccess of their lives, most humans, according to the Stoics, hold\nfalse opinions about what their happiness consists in, i.e. false\nopinions about what is good. In the eudaimonist framework in which\nStoic ethics is articulated, to claim that x is good (or a\ngood) is to claim that x is a constituent or causal source of\nhappiness. Stoic ethical theory therefore aims to provide an account\nof what really is good and what really brings\nhappiness to a human being, so that we can guide our lives\naccordingly. In this respect, the Stoics\u2019 aims are continuous\nwith those of the Epicureans, Peripatetics, and other rival ethical\nschools, but the eudaimonist philosophers of the Hellenistic and Roman\nperiods put forward different accounts of what human happiness\ngenuinely consists in, so that it became standard practice among\nancient writers to distinguish each school by its view of \u201cthe\nhighest good\u201d (summum bonum) and \u201cthe end\u201d\n(telos / finis) (cf. the title of Cicero\u2019s\ntreatise, De Finibus).\n",
