    "main_text": "Life and Writings || Date, City of Origin and Connections to Other Philosophers\n1.1 Date, City of Origin and Connections to Other Philosophers\n\nWe know very little about Philolaus\u2019 life. Only one brief and not very\nreliable ancient life of Philolaus survives, that of Diogenes Laertius\n(VIII 84\u20135). Diogenes includes Philolaus among the Pythagoreans;\nindeed he is, in fact, one of the three most important figures in the\nancient Pythagorean tradition, along with Pythagoras himself and\nArchytas. The central evidence for Philolaus\u2019 date is Plato\u2019s\nreference to him in the Phaedo (61d\u2013e). Socrates\u2019\ninterlocutors, Simmias and Cebes, indicate that they had heard\nPhilolaus in Thebes at some time before the dramatic date of the\ndialogue (399 BC). The passage suggests that Philolaus was no longer\nin Thebes in 399, but there is no indication that he has died. In\norder for Philolaus to have been a prominent teacher by the later\nfifth century he must have been born no later than 440. There are\nother indications that he was born even earlier. Both Philolaus and\nEurytus are identified by Aristoxenus as teachers of the last\ngeneration of Pythagoreans (D. L. VIII 46), who were in their twenties\nin 400 and active in the first half of the fourth century. Philolaus\nis also said to be the teacher of Eurytus (Iamblichus, VP\n139), however, so that the tradition makes most sense if Eurytus is\nborn ca. 440, and Philolaus belongs to the preceding generation and is\nthus born ca. 470. Such a dating would also fit with the tradition\nthat Philolaus was the teacher of and thus somewhat older than\nDemocritus (D. L. IX 38), who was born ca. 460. It is even less clear\nwhen he died, but one report suggests that he may still have been\nalive in the early 380s, when Plato first visited southern Italy (D.L.\nIII 6). If he lived from ca. 470 to ca. 385, Philolaus is an\napproximate contemporary of Socrates. Plutarch\u2019s story that as a young\nman Philolaus was one of two to escape the burning of the Pythagorean\nmeeting place in Metapontum in 454 (On the Sign of Socrates\n583a) would be consistent with this dating, but earlier versions of\nthe story do not mention Philolaus (Aristoxenus in Iamblichus,\nVP 249\u201350) so that it is far from certain that he was\ninvolved in the incident.\n\nDiogenes Laertius says that Philolaus was from the Greek city of\nCroton in southern Italy, but our earliest sources are divided as to\nhis city or origin. In his history of medicine, Aristotle\u2019s pupil\nMeno, who had access to Philolaus\u2019 book, also says that Philolaus was\nfrom Croton (DK 44 A27), but another of Aristotle\u2019s pupils,\nAristoxenus, who had close connections to the Pythagoreans, presents\nPhilolaus as from another Greek city in southern Italy, Tarentum (D.\nL. VIII 46, see also Iamblichus, VP 267, which probably\nderives from Aristoxenus). Perhaps the best way to solve the conflict\nis to suppose that Philolaus originally came from Croton and that,\nfollowing attacks on the Pythagoreans in other southern Italian cities\nca. 450 and his trip to Thebes in the late 400s, he may have settled\nin Tarentum late in his life. He is reported to have been the teacher\nof Archytas of Tarentum in one source (Cicero, de Orat. III\n34.139).\n\nThe ancient tradition gives no indication of who Philolaus\u2019 teacher(s)\nmight have been. Pythagoras died some twenty years before Philolaus\nwas born. He might have had some contact with the Pythagorean Hippasus\n(ca. 530\u2013450?), who was associated with the mathematics of music\ntheory, which is also a prominent theme in Philolaus. Philolaus should\nnot be understood as simply a Pythagorean, however. He was an\nimportant philosopher in his own right, and neither Plato nor Meno\nbothers to apply the label Pythagorean to him. He was influenced not\njust by the Pythagorean tradition but also as much or more by the\nbroader tradition of Presocratic philosophy. He was undoubtedly aware\nof the work of the medical writer/philosopher Alcmaeon, who also came\nfrom Croton. Anaxagoras and Empedocles were the most prominent\nphilosophers in the generation before Philolaus, and there is some\nevidence that he was in part responding to Anaxagoras (see 2.1).\nPhilolaus was the contemporary of the mathematicians Hippocrates of\nChios, who was the first to write an Elements of geometry,\nand Theodorus of Cyrene, and, although Philolaus was not a\nmathematician himself, his philosophy appears to have been influenced\nby the important new developments in Greek mathematics that they\nbrought about. Like most philosophers of the fifth century his work is\nin part a response to Parmenides (see 2.1 and 3).\u00a0\n",
