    "main_text": "The Condition Question || The Theory and Object Conceptions of the Physical\n4.1 The Theory and Object Conceptions of the Physical\n\nSo what is the answer to the condition question? If we concentrate for\nsimplicity on the notion of a physical property, we can discern two\nkinds of answers to this question (see Stoljar 2001, Stoljar 2010,\nTiehen 2018). The first ties the notion of a physical property to a\nnotion of a physical theory, for this reason we can call it the\ntheory-based conception of a physical property:\n\nThe theory-based conception:\n\nA property is physical iff it is the sort of property that physical\ntheory tells us about.\n\nAccording to the theory-based conception, for example, if physical\ntheory tells us about the property of having mass, then having mass is\na physical property. (The theory-based conception bears some relation\nto the notion of physical1 discussed in Feigl 1967; more explicit\ndefense is found in Smart 1978, Lewis 1994, Braddon-Mitchell and\nJackson 1996, and Chalmers 1996.)\n\nThe second kind of answer ties the notion of a physical property to\nthe notion of a physical object, for this reason we can call it the\nobject-based conception of a physical property:\n\nThe object-based conception:\n\nA property is physical iff it is the sort of property had by\nparadigmatic physical objects and their constituents.\n\nAccording to the object-based conception, for example if paradigmatic\nphysical objects such as rocks or planets are solid or are located in\nspace or have mass, then the property of being solid or located in\nspace or having mass is a physical property. (The best examples of\nphilosophers who operate with the object-conception of the physical\nare Meehl and Sellars 1956 and Feigl 1967; more recent defense is to\nbe found in Jackson 1998.)\n\nDo these conceptions characterize the same class of properties? There\nare a number of different possibilities here, but one that has\nreceived some attention in the literature is that physical theory only\ntells us about the dispositional properties of physical objects, and\nso does not tell us about the categorical properties, if any, that\nthey have \u2014 a thesis of this sort has been defended by a number\nof philosophers, among them Russell (1927), Armstrong (1968),\nBlackburn (1992) and Chalmers (1996). Hence, if physical objects do\nhave categorical properties, those properties will not count as\nphysical by the standards of the theory conception. On the other hand,\nthere seems no reason not to count them as physical in some sense or\nother. If that is right, however, then the possibility emerges that\nthe theory- and the object-conceptions characterize distinct classes\nof properties. \n\nA further distinction that can be made here, and which cross-cuts the\ntheory/object distinction, is between a more narrow and a more broad\nconception of a physical property (see Chalmers 2015). A narrow\nconception counts as a physical property only those within a\nrestricted range. On the theory conception, for example, these might\nthe properties expressed by fundamental physics. A broader conception\ncounts as physical property any property which is either a property in\nthe narrow sense (a narrow physical property, as we might call it) or\nelse bears the right kind of relation to narrow physical properties,\nfor example, is definable in terms of them, or is grounded in them.\nThere are lots of complications here, partly because there are\ndifferent ways of restricting the narrow class, and different ways of\nextending such a class. Here we will understand the theory and object\nconceptions in a narrower rather than a broad way.\n",
