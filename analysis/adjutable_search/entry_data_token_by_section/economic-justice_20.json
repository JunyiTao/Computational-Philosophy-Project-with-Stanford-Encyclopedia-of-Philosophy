    "main_text": "Related topics || Freedom and Rights\n7.1 Freedom and Rights\n\nSen (1970b) and Gibbard (1974) propose, within the framework of social\nchoice, paradoxes showing that it may not be easy to rank alternatives\nwhen some individuals have a special right to rank some alternatives\nthat differ only in matters belonging to their private sphere, and\nwhen their preferences are sensitive to what happens in other\nindividuals\u2019 private spheres. For instance, as an illustration\nof Gibbard\u2019s paradox, individuals have the right to choose the\ncolor of their shirt, but, in terms of social ranking, should A and B\nwear the same color or different colors, when A wants to imitate B and\nB wants to have a different color? There is a huge literature on this\ntopic, and after Gaertner, Pattanaik and Suzumura (1992), who argue\nthat no matter what choice A and B make, their rights to choose their\nown shirt is respected, a good part of it examines how to describe\nrights properly. The framework of game forms is an interesting\nalternative to the social choice model. Recent surveys can be found in\nArrow, Sen and Suzumura (1997, vol. 2).\n\nA related but different literature has focused on measuring the\nfreedom contained in a given menu from which a person may choose.\nInspired by Sen\u2019s (1985) remarks on how to value capabilities\n(see section 7.2 below), this literature has offered characterizations\nof various measures, starting from simple counting methods (Pattanaik\nand Xu 1990) and later on including additional considerations such as\nquality and diversity (e.g., Arlegi & Nieto 2001, Barbera et al.\n2004). Surveys of this literature can be found in Dowding and van Hees\n(2009) and Foster (2011).\n\nApart from this formal analysis of rights and measures of freedom,\neconomic theory is not very well connected to libertarian philosophy,\nsince economic models show that, apart from the very specific context\nof perfect competition with complete markets, perfect information, no\nexternalities and no public goods, the laissez-faire allocation is\ntypically inefficient and arbitrarily unequal. Therefore libertarian\nphilosophers do not find much help or inspiration in economic theory,\nand there is little cross-fertilization in this area.\n",
