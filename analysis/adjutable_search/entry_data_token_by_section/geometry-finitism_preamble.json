    "main_text": "\n\nIn our representations of the world, especially in physics,\n(mathematical) infinities play a crucial role. The continuum of the\nreal numbers, \\(\\Re\\), as a representation of time or of\none-dimensional space is surely the best known example and, by\nextension, the \\(n\\)-fold cartesian product, \\(\\Re^{n}\\), for\n\\(n\\)-dimensional space. However, these same infinities also cause\nproblems. One just has to think about Zeno\u2019s paradoxes or the\npresent-day continuation of that discussion, namely the discussion\nabout supertasks, to see the difficulties (see the entry on\n supertasks\n in this encyclopedia for a full treatment). Hence, it is a very\ntempting idea to investigate whether it is possible to eliminate these\ninfinities and still be able to do physics. The first step towards an\nanswer to that question is to examine whether or not a discrete\ngeometry is possible that can approximate classical continuous\ngeometry as closely as possible. For, if such is the case, the latter\ngeometry can easily be replaced by a discrete version in any physical\ntheory that makes use of this particular mathematical background.\n\nStraightforward as the task may seem, there are however at least two\nways in which the concept of approximation can be understood. Suppose\nthat \\(T\\) is a physical theory that is based on classical geometry.\nThen an approximation to \\(T\\) can mean two different things:\n\nFor all concepts in \\(T\\), including the geometrical concepts, a\ndiscrete analog is proposed (if such a thing exists), or\nAn underlying theory \\(T^\\prime\\) is formulated using possibly\ndifferent concepts in such a way that the classical concepts can be\nderived from \\(T^\\prime\\).\n\n\nIn the sections that follow an overview will be presented of (some of)\nthe various attempts that fall under (a) or (b). However, before\nembarking on this journey, several caveats have to be\nmentioned.\n",
