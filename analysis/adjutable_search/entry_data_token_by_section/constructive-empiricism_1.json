What makes for a literal understanding of a theory? While\nvan Fraassen does not offer a full-fledged account of literalness in\nThe Scientific Image, he does offer the following two\nnecessary conditions for a theory\u2019s being understood\nliterally:\n\nThe theory\u2019s claims are genuine statements capable of truth\nor falsity.\nAny literal construal of a theory cannot change the logical\nrelationships among the entities claimed by the\ntheory\u2014\u201cmost specifically, if a theory says that something\nexists, then a literal construal may elaborate on what that something\nis, but will not remove the implication of existence\u201d (1980,\n11).\n\n\nIn insisting on an understanding of scientific theories as literally\ntrue, the constructive empiricist sides with the scientific realist\nagainst conventionalists, logical positivists, and instrumentalists.\nWhile advocates of these latter positions may take scientific theories\nto be true, they do so only by interpreting those theories in\nnon-standard ways\u2014in ways that, for instance, violate (1) or (2)\nabove.\n",
