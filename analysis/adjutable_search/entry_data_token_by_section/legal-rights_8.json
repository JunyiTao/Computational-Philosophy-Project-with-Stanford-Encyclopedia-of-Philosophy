    "main_text": "What Rights Are: Function and Value || The Interest Theory\n4.2 The Interest Theory\n\nAccording to the Interest Theory, speaking broadly, rights protect or\nfurther right-holders\u2019 interests. Accordingly, unlike Will\nTheorists, Interest Theorists tend to emphasis claim-rights more than\npowers (Kramer 2013: 246; 2017: 49). Still fitting the Interest\nTheory, holding liberties, powers, and immunities is often also in the\nservice of one\u2019s interests (MacCormick 1977: 205). Prominent\nproponents of the Interest Theory include Bentham, Austin, Mill, Lyons,\nMacCormick, Raz, and Kramer. \n\nA canonical version of the Interest Theory is Joseph Raz\u2019s,\npositing that rights are protected interests and that X has a\nright if and only if \n\n\nan aspect of X\u2019s well-being (his interest) is a\nsufficient reason for holding some other person(s) to be under a duty.\n(1986: 166; 1994: 266\u2013269) \n\n\nUnder this view, X holds a legal right if the law\nholds X\u2019s interest \u201cto be sufficient ground to hold\nanother to be subject to a duty\u201d (1994: 268). \n\nPrescriptively, in demonstrating that rights are protective of\nright-holders\u2019 interests, the Interest Theory fleshes out how\nrights are attractive to political moralities prizing individual\nwell-being and welfare. \n\nIt is not obvious, however, that all legal norms identified as\n\u201crights\u201d under the Interest Theory indeed exhibit these\nappealing features. First, it is not uncommon for legal rights to be\nheld by entities other than people. For instance, legal rights have\nbeen extended to animals, plants, corporations, and even natural\nphenomena (e.g., rivers or nature preserves). Depending on one\u2019s\nconception of \u201cinterest\u201d, the interest-theory can\ncomfortably capture at least some such rights (Kramer 2001:\n29\u201346). For example, it seems obvious that certain animals,\ngroups, corporations, and even plants have interests and, as such, can\nbe made better or worse off and, therefore, can in that sense hold\nrights. \n\nYet, an account of such rights as inherently morally favorable in\nterms of benefiting right-holders would have to rely on values other\nthan individuals\u2019 well-being or welfare. Which in certain\ninstances seems unproblematic, such as in the case of animal rights.\nYet, in other cases, such as in the case of corporate entities, the\ninterests of which do not seem of inherent moral value, the notion\nthat in protecting interests all rights\u2014qua\nrights\u2014share something morally appealing comes under\npressure.\n\nSecond, arguably even in the case of individuals not all\nrights-protected interests are of any moral value. For instance, the\nIraqi Penal Code of 1969 provides husbands the \u201clegal\nright\u201d to \u201cpunish\u201d their wives, to the exclusion of\ncrimes such as battery (such laws are, regretfully, not atypical;\nsimilar laws existed in the West for centuries). Even if such legal\nrights in some sense serve certain prudential or subjective interests\nof husbands, and assuming the Interest Theory were to incorporate such\ninterests and identify norms protective of such interests as\n\u201crights\u201d, it is not clear in what sense protecting such\ninterests makes rights\u2014qua rights\u2014morally\nattractive. And remember, a primary motivation for developing theories\nof the function of rights is ideally not to find just any uniting\nfeature of all \u201crights\u201d, but to identify one that is of\nvalue. For a related discussion on how the Interest Theory may\narguably incorporate odd and seemingly valueless interests, and even\nsubjective interests that are objectively bad for one, see Kramer\n(2001: 81\u201389). \n",
