    "main_text": "Eastern Han (25\u2013220CE) || The Development of Late Han Naturalism: Huan Tan\n3.1 The Development of Late Han Naturalism: Huan Tan\n\nAlthough Huan Tan (43 BCE\u201328 CE) was a contemporary of Yang\nXiong (with whom he interacted), he can be considered the first of the\nphilosophers of the Eastern Han. Like Yang Xiong, Huan was associated\nwith the Xin court of Wang Mang, and was for this reason criticized by\na number of later figures, but unlike Yang, Huan\u2019s life and work\nstretched a few years into the Eastern Han, and Huan\u2019s\nreputation was salvaged to some extent by his continued service as an\nofficial in the second Han Dynasty.\n\nHuan Tan receives a special section here, unlike other of his\ncontemporaries such as Liu Xin, because of his influence on the\nphilosophy of the rest of the Eastern Han, both in argumentative style\nand in content. In Huan\u2019s major philosophical work,\nXinlun (\u201cNew Discourses\u201d), which only exists\ntoday in fragmentary form, he offered a naturalistic and physicalistic\nview of mind/spirit (jingshen \u7cbe\u795e), arguing that\nthe spirit is dependent on and linked to the body, and that it thus\ndies with the death of the body. In this way, Huan criticizes what he\ntakes to be superstitious views accepting the existence of ghosts or\ndisembodied spirits. He also objected to the popular practices of the\ntime of seeking of immortality through alchemy, physical techniques,\nor intellectual cultivation. We cannot, Huan argued, forestall the\nnatural decline and ultimate death of the human organism. This\ncritical spirit taking aim at earlier non-physicalistic views comes to\nmark a number of thinkers in the Eastern Han, most prominently Wang\nChong. Huan describes the connection between the conscious spirit\n(jingshen) and the body (xing) thus, in discussing\nwhat he takes to be the wrongheadedness of the life-extension\ntechniques of esoteric Daoists:\n\n\nThe conscious spirit inhabits the body as a flame does a candle. If\nthe candle is properly tended and turned so that it follows the flame\nneed not be extinguished until the candle is all used up. Of course,\nif the candle has no flame, it cannot become active in the void, nor\ncan its ashes be lighted later. (fragment from Hongming Ji\n5.18, Pokora [trans.] 1975: 76\u201377).\n\n\nWhile the literature of criticism had long been a part of Chinese\nintellectual culture, in Huan\u2019s work we begin to see more direct\nand incisive criticism, rather than the carefully expressed, indirect,\nand suggestive criticism we see earlier in the Western Han, when\nfu poetry was a dominant form of presentation of critique and\nliterary subtlety and indirectness were prized. Such indirect\ncriticism through fu poetry was still practiced in the\nEastern Han, by masters of the art such as Cai Yong, but the more\ndirect critical literature of scholars like Huan Tan came to play a\nlarger role in this period. Huan\u2019s critical stance undermined\nmany earlier traditional practices, such as divination, and he does\nnot, unlike many previous thinkers, rely on historical precedent and\nappeals to the figures of the past. This aligns him to some extent\nwith the realist pragmatism of the Legalists, although it is incorrect\nto see Huan in terms of this older school designation that had no\ncache in the Han. His thought is representative of the critical,\nrationalist, and more insistently naturalist mode of thinking that\nbecame more prominent in the Eastern Han. Huan and others criticized\nwhat they saw as the excesses of the metaphysics of correlative\ncosmology of the Western Han, and its tendency to proliferate entities\nin its ontology, many of which Huan thought were imaginary.\nHuan\u2019s critical style is clearly echoed in later thinkers of the\nEastern Han such as Wang Fu and Wang Chong. Particularly in his\napproach to the classical texts, we find influence on later thinkers\nsuch as Wang Chong. Huan advocated a piecemeal approach rather than\nacceptance or rejection of a text as a whole. We should accept what is\ntrue and reject what is false in the writings of the past.\n\n\nAlthough there are unfounded and outrageous passages in\u2026those\nother books, we must use what is best in them. How dare we talk of\nrejecting them completely? (Xinlun, Pokora [trans.] 1975:\nxvi, 2)\n\n\nHuan\u2019s political and ethical program followed this critical and\npiecemeal approach. While he did not, as early Legalists such as Han\nFeizi, completely reject the way of the sages of the past as a guide\nfor current political practice, he did follow the Legalists in holding\nthat the features of current situations should ultimately determine\npractice, and that at least some of the models of the past should be\nrejected.\n",
