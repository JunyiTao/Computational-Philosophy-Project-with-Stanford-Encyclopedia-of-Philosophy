    "main_text": "Philosophical questions for IP || Decision making\n3.3 Decision making\nOne important use that models of belief can be put to is as part of\na theory of rational decision. IP is no different. Decision making\nwith imprecise probabilities has some problems, however.\nThe problem for IP decision making, in short, is that your credal\ncommittee can disagree on what the best course of action is, and when\nthey do, it is unclear how you should act (recall the definitions\nin section 1.1). Imagine betting on a coin of\nunknown bias. Consider the indicator gambles on heads and tails. Both\nbets have imprecise expectation \\([0,1]\\). How\nare you supposed to compare these expectations? The bets are\nincomparable. (If the coin case appears to have too much exploitable\nsymmetry, consider unit bets on Elga pulling toothpaste or jellyfish\nfrom his bag.) This incomparability, argues Williamson, leads to\ndecision making paralysis, and this highlights a flaw in the\nepistemology (2010: 70). This argument\nseems to be missing the point, however, if one of our motivations for\nIP is precisely to be able to represent such incompatibility of\nprospects (see section 2.2)! The\nincommensurability of options entailed by IP is not a bug, it\u2019s a\nfeature. Decision making with imprecise probabilities is discussed\nby Seidenfeld\n(2004), Troffaes\n(2007), Seidenfeld, Schervish, and\nKadane (2010), Bradley\n(2015), Williams\n(2014), Huntley, Hable, and Troffaes\n(2014).\nA more serious worry confronts IP when you have to make sequences\nof decisions. There is a rich literature in economics on sequences of\ndecisions for agents who fail to be orthodox expected utility\nmaximisers (Seidenfeld 1988; 1994; Machina\n1989; Al-Najjar and Weinstein 2009, and the references\ntherein). This topic was brought to the attention\nof philosophers again after the publication of\nElga\u2019s (2010) paper Subjective\nProbabilities Should Be Sharp which highlights the problem with a\nsimple decision example, although a very similar example appears\nin Hammond (1988) in relation to\nSeidenfeld\u2019s discussion of Levi\u2019s decision rule\n\u201cE-admissibility\u201d (Seidenfeld\n1988).\nA version of the problem is as follows. You are about to be offered\ntwo bets on a coin of unknown bias, \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\), one after the other. The bets pay\nout as follows:\n\n\\(A\\) loses 10 if the coin lands heads and wins 15 otherwise\n\\(B\\) wins 15 if the coin lands heads and loses 10 otherwise\n\nIf we assume you have beliefs represented\nby \\(P(H)=[0,1]\\), these bets have\nexpectations of \\([-10,15]\\). Refusing each\nbet has expectation of 0. So accepting and\nrefusing \\(A\\) are incomparable with respect\nto your beliefs. Likewise for \\(B\\). The\nproblem is that refusing both bets seems to be irrational,\nsince accepting both bets gets you a guaranteed payoff of 5. Elga\nargues that no decision rule for imprecise probabilities can rule out\nrefusing both bets. He then argues that this shows that imprecise\nprobabilities are bad epistemology. Neither argument\nworks. Chandler (2014)\nand Sahlin and Weirich (2014) both point\nout that a certain kind of imprecise decision rule does make refusing\nboth bets impermissible and Elga has acknowledged this in an erratum\nto his paper. Bradley and Steele (2014a)\nargue that decision rules that make refusing both bets merely\npermissible are legitimate ways to make imprecise decisions. They also\npoint out that the rule that Chandler, and Sahlin and Weirich advocate\nhas counterintuitive consequences in other decision problems. \n\n\nMoss (2015) relates\nElga-style IP decision problems to moral dilemmas and uses the analogy\nto explain the conflicting intuitions in Elga\u2019s problem.\nSud (2014) and Rinard (2015)\nboth also offer alternative decision theories for imprecise probabilities.\nBradley (2019) argues that all three struggle to accommodate a version of the Ellsberg decisions discussed above.\n\n\nEven if\nElga\u2019s argument worked and there were no good imprecise decision\nrules, that wouldn\u2019t show that IP was a faulty model of belief. We\nwant to be able to represent the suspension of judgement on various\nthings, including on the relative goodness of a number of\noptions. Such incommensurability inevitably brings with it some\nproblems for sequential decisions (see, for\nexample, Broome 2000), but this is not an argument against the\nepistemology. As Bradley and Steele note, Elga\u2019s argument\u2014if it\nwere valid\u2014could mutatis mutandis be used as an\nargument that there are no incommensurable goods and this seems too\nstrong. \n",
