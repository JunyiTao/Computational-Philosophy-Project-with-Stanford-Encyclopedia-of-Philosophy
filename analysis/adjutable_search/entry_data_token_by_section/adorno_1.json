    "main_text": "Dialectic of Enlightenment\n2. Dialectic of Enlightenment\n\n\nLong before \u201cpostmodernism\u201d became fashionable, Adorno and Horkheimer\nwrote one of the most searching critiques of modernity to have emerged\namong progressive European intellectuals. Dialectic of\nEnlightenment is a product of their wartime exile. It first\nappeared as a mimeograph titled Philosophical Fragments in\n1944. This title became the subtitle when the book was published in\n1947. Their book opens with a grim assessment of the modern West:\n\u201cEnlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of\nthought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and\ninstalling them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth radiates\nunder the sign of disaster triumphant\u201d (DE 1, translation\nmodified). How can this be, the authors ask. How can the progress of\nmodern science and medicine and industry promise to liberate people\nfrom ignorance, disease, and brutal, mind-numbing work, yet help\ncreate a world where people willingly swallow fascist ideology,\nknowingly practice deliberate genocide, and energetically develop\nlethal weapons of mass destruction? Reason, they answer, has become\nirrational.\n\n\nAlthough they cite Francis Bacon as a leading spokesman for an\ninstrumentalized reason that becomes irrational, Horkheimer and Adorno\ndo not think that modern science and scientism are the sole culprits.\nThe tendency of rational progress to become irrational regress arises\nmuch earlier. Indeed, they cite both the Hebrew scriptures and Greek\nphilosophers as contributing to regressive tendencies. If Horkheimer\nand Adorno are right, then a critique of modernity must also be a\ncritique of premodernity, and a turn toward the postmodern cannot\nsimply be a return to the premodern. Otherwise the failures of\nmodernity will continue in a new guise under contemporary conditions.\nSociety as a whole needs to be transformed.\n\n\nHorkheimer and Adorno believe that society and culture form a\nhistorical totality, such that the pursuit of freedom in society is\ninseparable from the pursuit of enlightenment in culture (DE xvi).\nThere is a flip side to this: a lack or loss of freedom in\nsociety\u2014in the political, economic, and legal structures within\nwhich we live\u2014signals a concomitant failure in cultural\nenlightenment\u2014in philosophy, the arts, religion, and the\nlike. The Nazi death camps are not an aberration, nor are mindless\nstudio movies innocent entertainment. Both indicate that something\nfundamental has gone wrong in the modern West.\n\n\nAccording to Horkheimer and Adorno, the source of today's disaster is\na pattern of blind domination, domination in a triple sense: the\ndomination of nature by human beings, the domination of nature within\nhuman beings, and, in both of these forms of domination, the\ndomination of some human beings by others. What motivates such triple\ndomination is an irrational fear of the unknown: \u201cHumans believe\nthemselves free of fear when there is no longer anything unknown. This\nhas determined the path of\ndemythologization\u00a0\u2026\u00a0. Enlightenment is mythical fear\nradicalized\u201d (DE 11). In an unfree society whose culture pursues\nso-called progress no matter what the cost, that which is \u201cother,\u201d\nwhether human or nonhuman, gets shoved aside, exploited, or destroyed.\nThe means of destruction may be more sophisticated in the modern West,\nand the exploitation may be less direct than outright slavery, but\nblind, fear-driven domination continues, with ever greater global\nconsequences. The all-consuming engine driving this process is an\never-expanding capitalist economy, fed by scientific research and the\nlatest technologies.\n\n\nContrary to some interpretations, Horkheimer and Adorno do not\nreject the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. Nor do they provide a\nnegative \u201cmetanarrative\u201d of universal historical decline. Rather,\nthrough a highly unusual combination of philosophical argument,\nsociological reflection, and literary and cultural commentary, they\nconstruct a \u201cdouble perspective\u201d on the modern West as a historical\nformation (Jarvis 1998, 23). They summarize this double perspective in\ntwo interlinked theses: \u201cMyth is already enlightenment, and\nenlightenment reverts to mythology\u201d (DE xviii). The first thesis allows\nthem to suggest that, despite being declared mythical and outmoded by\nthe forces of secularization, older rituals,\nreligions, and philosophies may have contributed to the process of\nenlightenment and may still have something worthwhile to contribute.\nThe second thesis allows them to expose ideological and destructive\ntendencies within modern forces of secularization,\nbut without denying either that these forces are progressive and\nenlightening or that the older conceptions they displace were\nthemselves ideological and destructive.\n\n\nA fundamental mistake in many interpretations of Dialectic of\nEnlightenment occurs when readers take such theses to be\ntheoretical definitions of unchanging categories rather than critical\njudgments about historical tendencies. The authors are not saying that\nmyth is \u201cby nature\u201d a force of enlightenment. Nor are they claiming\nthat enlightenment \u201cinevitably\u201d reverts to mythology. In fact, what\nthey find really mythical in both myth and enlightenment is the thought\nthat fundamental change is impossible. Such resistance to change\ncharacterizes both ancient myths of fate and modern devotion to the\nfacts.\n\n\nAccordingly, in constructing a \u201cdialectic of enlightenment\u201d the\nauthors simultaneously aim to carry out a dialectical enlightenment of\nenlightenment not unlike Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. Two\nHegelian concepts anchor this project, namely, determinate negation\nand conceptual self-reflection. \u201cDeterminate negation\u201d (bestimmte\nNegation) indicates that immanent criticism is the way to wrest\ntruth from ideology. A dialectical enlightenment of enlightenment\n\u201cdiscloses each image as script. It teaches us to read from [the\nimage's] features the admission of falseness which cancels its power\nand hands it over to truth\u201d (DE 18). Beyond and through such\ndeterminate negation, a dialectical enlightenment of enlightenment\nalso recalls the origin and goal of thought itself. Such recollection\nis the work of the concept as the self-reflection of thought (der\nBegriff als Selbstbesinnung des Denkens, DE 32). Conceptual\nself-reflection reveals that thought arises from the very corporeal\nneeds and desires that get forgotten when thought becomes a mere\ninstrument of human self-preservation. It also reveals that the goal\nof thought is not to continue the blind domination of nature and\nhumans but to point toward reconciliation. Adorno works out the\ndetails of this conception in his subsequent lectures on Kant (KC),\nethics (PMP), and metaphysics (MCP) and in his books on Husserl (AE),\nHegel (H), and Heidegger (JA). His most comprehensive statement occurs\nin Negative Dialectics, which is discussed later.\n",
