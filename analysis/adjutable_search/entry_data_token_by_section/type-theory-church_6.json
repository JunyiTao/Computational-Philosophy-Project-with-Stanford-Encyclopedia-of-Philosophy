    "main_text": "Metatheory || Higher-Order Unification\n3.2 Higher-Order Unification\n\nThe challenges in higher-order unification are outlined very briefly.\nMore details on the topic are given in Dowek 2001; its utilization in\nhigher-order theorem provers is also discussed in Benzm\u00fcller\n& Miller 2014.\n\nDefinition. A higher-order unifier for a\npair \\(\\langle \\bA,\\bB\\rangle\\) of wffs is a substitution \\(\\theta\\)\nfor free occurrences of variables such that \\(\\theta \\bA\\) and\n\\(\\theta \\bB\\) have the same \u03b2-normal form. A higher-order\nunifier for a set of pairs of wffs is a unifier for each of the pairs\nin the set.\n\nHigher-order unification differs from first-order unification (Baader\n& Snyder 2001) in a number of important respects. In\nparticular:\n\nEven when a unifier for a pair of wffs exists, there may be no\nmost general unifier (Gould 1966).\nHigher-order unification is undecidable (Huet 1973b), even in the\n\u201csecond-order\u201d case (Goldfarb 1981).\n\n\nHowever, an algorithm has been devised (Huet 1975, Jensen &\nPietrzykowski 1976), called pre-unification, which will find\na unifier for a set of pairs of wffs if one exists. The pre-unifiers\ncomputed by Huet\u2019s procedure are substitutions that can reduce\nthe original unification problem to one involving only so called\nflex-flex unification pairs. Flex-flex pairs have variable\nhead symbols in both terms to be unified and they are known to always\nhave a solution. The concrete computation of these solutions can thus\nbe postponed or omitted. Pre-unification is utilized in all the\nresolution based theorem provers mentioned in\n Section 4.\n \n\nPattern unification refers a small subset of unification\nproblems, first studied by Miller 1991, whose identification has been\nimportant for the construction of practical systems. In a pattern\nunification problem every occurrence of an existentially quantified\nvariable is applied to a list of arguments that are all distinct\nvariables bound by either a \u03bb-binder or a universal quantifier\nin the scope of the existential quantifier. Thus, existentially\nquantified variables cannot be applied to general terms but a very\nrestricted set of bound variables. Pattern unification, like\nfirst-order unification, is decidable and most general unifiers exist\nfor solvable problems. This is why pattern unification is preferably\nemployed (when applicable) in some state-of-the-art theorem provers\nfor Church\u2019s type theory. \n",
