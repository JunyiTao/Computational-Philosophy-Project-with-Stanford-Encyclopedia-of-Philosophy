    "main_text": "Religious Minimalism || Wittgenstein\n4.2 Wittgenstein\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s work on religion has served as a sourcebook for\nmodern opposition to the face value theory. His remarks have been seen\nas lending support to many of the positions considered in this\narticle. Non-cognitivists can find support in Wittgenstein\u2019s\ncharacterisation of religion as \u201ca passionate commitment to a\nsystem of reference\u201d (1970 [1994, 64]; see also Tilghman 1991);\nfictionalists in his proposal that religious believers live their\nlives according to certain \u201cpictures\u201d; non-assertoric\nspeech act theorists in his comparison of religious utterances to\ncommands (1970 [1994, 61]). Wittgenstein was even attracted (if only\nbriefly) to a subjectivist interpretation of God-talk ([PO]:\n42). Given Wittgenstein writings on religion are only infrequent and\nrelatively brief, it is perhaps not surprising that, beyond his clear\nresistance to the face value theory, he would not have settled views\non the topic. For accounts profoundly influenced by or interpretative\nof Wittgenstein, see Winch (1987), N. Malcom (1997), Rhees (1970).\n\nThe minimalist reading of Wittgenstein is supported by his apparent\nendorsements of a deflationary account of truth (1953: 136), although\nhe does not explicitly endorse the idealised justification theory that\nPutnam proposes. However, the best evidence for minimalism comes from\nhis emphasis on the differences between the use of religious\nsentences, and historical or scientific (and in general empirical and\ndescriptive) sentences. Specifically, he points up differences between\nthe standards of warrant employed in religious and other\ndiscourses\u2014the kinds of circumstance in which a religious\nbeliever judges something to be true, grounds for disagreements\nbetween religious believers and non-believers, and so on. This\npervades his work on religion. For example, Wittgenstein compares the\nreligious belief in the Last Judgement with scientifically based\nbeliefs, or ordinary beliefs about observable states of affairs (he\ngives the example \u201cThere is a German aeroplane overhead\u201d).\nWhile religious believers may speak of \u201cevidence\u201d and\n\u201chistorical events\u201d, Wittgenstein argues that the evidence\nand events cited in connection with religious judgements do not\nconstitutes reasons to believe them in the way that evidence given in\nsupport of a hypothesis gives a reason to believe that the hypothesis\nis true. In religious discourse \u201creasons look entirely different\nfrom normal reasons\u201d (1966: 56), religious belief is not\n\u201ca matter of reasonability\u201d (1966: 58), religious beliefs\nare not hypotheses or opinions, they are not properly spoken of as\nobjects of knowledge or as having a high probability, and when\nhistorical facts are introduced in support of religious belief\n\u201cthey are not treated as historical, empirical,\npropositions\u201d (1966: 57). Here Wittgenstein seems at pains to\nemphasise the contrast between religious discourse and empirical\ndiscourses. Indeed, he implies that when taken (or where offered) as\nreporting scientific facts or scientific theories, religious sentences\nare in error. Wittgenstein is not, according to the minimalist\ninterpretation, seeking to find any disadvantageous comparison between\nreligion and science; to show, for example, that religion is merely\nexpressive of attitudes, while science is properly descriptive.\nRather, he is describing the different standards that make for truth\nand descriptiveness in these fields of discourse and, in so doing,\nelucidating the distinctive characteristics of religious\ntruth as well as other realism-relevant concepts.\n\nNotably, if Wittgenstein was a minimalist about religious discourse\nthen one standard line of objection to his account is misplaced.\nWittgenstein is sometimes criticised as proposing that religious\ndiscourse should be quarantined from other areas of discourse, in\nparticular science and history. This is seen as leading to a variety\nof fideism, where religious beliefs are compartmentalised and\nunsusceptible to non-religious intellectual evaluation. The objection\nis forcefully prosecuted by Kai Nielsen. According to Wittgenstein,\nNielsen argues, \n\n\nno philosophical or other kind of reasonable criticism, or for that\nmatter defence, is possible for forms of life or, indeed, of any form\nof life, including Hinduism, Christianity and the like. (2000: 147)\n\n\n\nHowever, contrasting the different standards exhibited by religious\nand scientific discourses is consistent with scientifically or\nhistorically well-founded evidence informing religious judgement.\nIndeed, minimalists would be remiss in not taking account of the fact\nthat historical evidence clearly is seriously weighed in a\nvariety of religious beliefs including belief in Christ\u2019s\nresurrection, or the creation of the world, and beliefs about miracle\nworkers and what they have done. Insofar as this happens, the verdicts\nof historical or scientific investigation can modify religious\njudgements. In a similar way, many religious judgements are dependent\non historically or scientifically assessable evidence. For example,\ncompelling evidence that the documentary and eyewitness testimony for\na miracle was a hoax would be a good reason not to believe that the\nmiracle in question occurred and this evidence comes from\n\u201coutside\u201d the religious language game. However,\nminimalists can allow that empirical evidence is part of the\njustification for many religious beliefs while maintaining the theory\nthat religious discourse employs distinct standards of justification\nto science.\n",
