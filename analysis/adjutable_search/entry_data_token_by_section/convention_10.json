    "main_text": "Critical reactions to Lewis || Which equilibrium concept?\n4.3 Which equilibrium concept?\n\n\nThe game-theoretic literature contains numerous solution concepts that\neither generalize or refine Nash equilibrium. Various commentators\nsuggest that a proper analysis of convention requires one of these\nalternate solution concepts. For instance, Robert Sugden (1986/2004)\nanalyzes convention as a system of evolutionarily stable\nstrategies. On this approach, not only are conventions self-enforcing,\nbut they have an additional stability property: once established, they\ncan resist invasion by deviant agents trying to establish a new\nconvention. Sugden argues that this approach illuminates a wide range\nof social phenomena, including familiar examples such as money and\nproperty.\n\n\nAnother widely discussed solution concept is correlated\nequilibrium, introduced by Robert Aumann (1974, 1987). To\nillustrate this generalized concept, consider a modified version of\nRestaurant Rendezvous. In the new version (sometimes called\n\u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d), each agent prefers a different\nrestaurant, although both agents prefer meeting to not meeting. We\nrepresent this situation with the following payoff matrix:\n\n\n\n\nLuigi\u2019s\nFabio\u2019s\n\n\nLuigi\u2019s\n2, 1\n0, 0\n\n\nFabio\u2019s\n0, 0\n1, 2\n\n\nBattle of the Sexes Payoff Matrix\n\n\n\nThis game has two \u201cpure\u201d Nash equilibria: one in which\nboth players go to Luigi\u2019s, the other in which both go to\nFabio\u2019s. Intuitively, neither equilibrium is fair, since one\nplayer achieves a higher payoff than the other. The game also has a\n\u201cmixed-strategy\u201d Nash equilibrium: that is, an equilibrium\nin which each agent chooses his strategy based upon the outcome of a\nrandomizing device. Specifically, the game has a mixed-strategy\nequilibrium in which \\(A\\) goes to Luigi\u2019s with probability\n\\(\\bfrac{2}{3}\\) and \\(B\\) goes to Luigi\u2019s with probability \\(\\bfrac{1}{3}\\).\n\\(A\\)\u2019s expected payoff from this equilibrium is given as\nfollows, where \u201c\\(Prob(x, y)\\)\u201d\ndenotes the probability that \\(A\\) goes to \\(x\\) and\n\\(B\\) goes to \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nA\\text{\u2019s expected payoff} &= Prob(\\text{Luigi\u2019s, Luigi\u2019s})\\times 2 \\\\\n  &\\quad + Prob(\\text{Luigi\u2019s, Fabio\u2019s})\\times 0 \\\\ \n  &\\quad + Prob(\\text{Fabio\u2019s, Luigi\u2019s})\\times 0 \\\\ \n  &\\quad + Prob(\\text{Fabio\u2019s, Fabio\u2019s})\\times 1 \\\\ \n  &= \\bfrac{2}{9}\\times 2 + \\bfrac{2}{9} \\times 0 + \\bfrac{2}{9} \\times 0 + \\bfrac{2}{9} \\times 1 \\\\\n  &= \\bfrac{2}{3}.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nSimilarly, \\(B\\)\u2019s expected payoff\nis \\(\\bfrac{2}{3}\\). Neither player can improve upon this\npayoff by deviating from the mixed-strategy equilibrium, given that\nthe other player is playing her end of the equilibrium. This\nequilibrium is fair, in that it yields the same expected payoff for\nboth players. But it also yields a lower expected payoff for each\nplayer than either pure equilibrium, since there is a decent chance\nthat the players\u2019 separate randomizing devices will lead to them to\ndifferent restaurants.\n\n\nIf the players can contrive to correlate their actions with a\ncommon randomizing device, they can achieve a new equilibrium\nthat is fair and that Pareto dominates the old mixed-strategy\nequilibrium. More specifically, suppose that there is a\nsingle coin toss: each player goes to Luigi\u2019s if the toss is\nheads, Fabio\u2019s if the toss is tails. The resulting strategy\ncombination yields an expected payoff of \\(\\bfrac{3}{2}\\) for\neach player. Intuitively, this strategy combination is an\nequilibrium, since no player has reason to deviate unilaterally from\nit. But the strategy combination does not count as a Nash\nequilibrium of the original game, since in mixed Nash equilibria\nplayers\u2019 actions must be probabilistically independent. Aumann calls\nthis strategy combination a correlated equilibrium, since\nplayers\u2019 actions are probabilistically correlated. He develops this\nintuitive idea in great formal detail, without reliance upon explicit\npre-game communication between players.\n\n\nBuilding upon Aumann\u2019s formal treatment, Brian Skyrms (1996) and\nPeter Vanderschraaf (1998b, 2001) argue that we should treat convention\nas a kind of correlated equilibrium. For example, consider the\nconvention that drivers at traffic intersections correlate their\nactions with the color of the traffic signal. As the restaurant and\ntraffic examples illustrate, correlated equilibria often provide far\nmore satisfactory solutions to coordination problems than one could\notherwise achieve.\n",
