    "main_text": "International Rule of Law || UN Security Council Resolutions\n5.5 International Criminal Law\n\nAs a newly emergent area of international law, one main concern about\ninternational criminal law\u2019s respect for the rule of law has\ntraditionally focused on whether it complies with the demand that\nindividuals should have fair warning that certain kinds of behaviour\nare criminally prohibited and attract liability to punishment. A\ndramatic illustration of this problem is the Nuremburg Trials, where\nit was questionable whether all of the grievous wrongs for which Nazi\ndefendants were tried were in fact criminally prohibited by\ninternational law at the time they were committed (Kelsen 1947: 171).\nOne response to these concerns is to argue that the wrongs in question\nwere so obviously evil, and the subjection of their perpetrators to\ncriminal trial and punishment so clearly justified and predictable,\nthat the obligation to give due notice did not have great weight\n(Luban 2010: 583\u2013587). To a significant degree, this problem has\nnow been addressed, both as a result of the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court, which defines the crimes of genocide,\ncrimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, and\nassigns jurisdiction to the International Criminal Court, and as a\nresult of the evolution of counterpart norms in customary\ninternational law.\n\nYet a serious problem remains with another component of the rule of\nlaw, which is the congruence between official conduct and legal norms,\nensuring that like cases are treated alike and therefore that all\nprospective defendants are equal before the law. This is the scandal\nthat the defendants who stand trial for international crimes\noverwhelmingly come from the Global South rather than from the\npowerful North Atlantic democracies. This is deeply troubling, given\nthe great importance that the rule of law is typically thought to\npossess in the criminal law context, and has led even one expert to\nspeak of the \u201cdemise of international criminal law\u201d (Osiel\n2014\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n One can imagine various responses to this concern. One is that the\nabsence of a centralized global state whose arbitrary exercise of\nmassive power urgently needs to be reined in by law greatly diminishes\nthis rule of law blemish in the international case (Luban 2010:\n583\u2013587). Another is a more pragmatic response, according to\nwhich the edifice of international criminal justice must be patiently\nbuilt up, brick by brick, and that geographically skewed prosecutions\nhave their value, despite the cost incurred in transgressing the rule\nof law, as they are part of an ongoing effort to make international\ncriminal law more generally effective over time.\n",
