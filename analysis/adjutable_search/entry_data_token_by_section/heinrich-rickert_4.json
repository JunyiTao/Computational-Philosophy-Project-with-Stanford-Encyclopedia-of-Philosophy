Metaphilosophy\n\nPhilosophy has to be characterized as the scientific activity,\nwhich, in the stream of restlessly forward-moving development,\nendeavors to make a stop and find a resting point. It stands still in\norder to bring to light the significance for the meaning of life of\nwhat has been hitherto achieved.\n(Rickert 1921b, 410)\n\n\n\nRickert\u2019s conception of philosophy is tightly connected to his\nnotion of worldview. Worldview (Weltanschauung) was a buzzword\nin early twentieth century German culture. Life-philosophers and\nanti-rationalists used the phrase \u2018Weltanschauung\u2019\nto designate the inherently elusive and obscure source of all cultural\nlife and thinking (see Dilthey 1960, 80; Simmel 1996, 29; Mannheim\n1952, 38). On this reading philosophy is nothing but the conceptual\narticulation of pre-theoretical worldviews that are inextricably\nrelated to the historical, psychological, and cultural conditions of\nindividual philosophers. Worldview philosophy was extremely critical of\nall attempts to describe the discipline as a science, that is, as a\npurely theoretical enterprise. Rooted in existentially grounded\nworldviews, philosophy is an expression of the whole human\nbeing and not merely an impersonal conceptual construction of the\none-sided \u2018theoretical man\u2019 (see Staiti 2013b, 795\u2013799).\n\n\nRickert agrees that philosophy, unlike the specialized empirical\nsciences, must be oriented toward the world as a whole\n(Weltganze), and not merely toward this or that specific part\nof the world (Rickert 1910, 1; Rickert 1934, 1). However, he firmly\nrejects the view that, in order to grasp the world as a whole,\nphilosophers ought to shun the ideal of scientificity and work as\nwhole human beings merely expressing what their existential\nintuition of the world-whole suggests. In this regard, for Rickert,\nthe phrase \u2018worldview\u2019 should designate the goal\nof philosophical work and not philosophy\u2019s obscure existential\norigin. Furthermore, the goal of a comprehensive theory of\nworldview can only be achieved with the aid of concepts and logical\nthinking, that is, adopting a scientific standpoint. Contra\nDilthey, Simmel, and the antirationalist life-philosophers Rickert\npoints out that \u201conly the one-sided, theoretically oriented man\nis able to reflect upon the world in its totality\u201d (Rickert\n1933, 50). On the contrary, \u201c[t]he whole human being, precisely\nas \u2018whole\u2019 or \u2018existing\u2019 human being, will\nnever transcend his \u2018small\u2019 world and this small world\ninevitably takes on different shapes for different people. For the\npre-scientific man only that which stands in an essential connection\nwith his own life can become \u2018world\u2019\u201d (Rickert 1933,\n49\u201350; see Staiti 2013b: 799\u2013804). Rickert contends that the historical beginnings of\nphilosophy in ancient Greece coincide with the birth of a purely\n\u2018theoretical man\u2019, that is, of a subject who pursues\nknowledge for knowledge\u2019s sake and in so doing discloses a dimension\nof totality unknown to natural, practically oriented human subjects\n(Rickert 1923b).\n\n\nIn order to produce knowledge about the world as a whole, philosophy\ncannot rely on empirical methods like the specialized sciences do, nor\ncan it simplistically project one concept or set of concepts describing\none of the world\u2019s parts onto the world-whole. For Rickert\nphilosophy has to rely on what he calls \u201cthe heterological\nprinciple\u201d (Rickert 1921b, 57; Rickert 1934b, 39). Scholars agree\nthat the notion of heterology is the most distinctive element of\nRickert\u2019s philosophy (Glockner 1937, 11; Flach 1958, 564; Orth\n1998, 81) and even his \u201cprinciple of all principles\u201d\n(Krijnen 2001, 256). Heterology is a relational mode of thinking, which\nRickert considers paramount to the theoretical determination of objects\nin general (Rickert 1921b, 57) and utterly unavoidable for a conceptual\ngrasp of totalities. It consists in using a pair of mutually\nexclusive concepts, that is, concepts that negate each other, and take\nthem together as complementary. To think heterologically means to posit\na given initial concept (thesis) and then proceed to posit a\nsecond concept that can be seen as its \u2018other\u2019\n(hetero-thesis), so that the two concepts taken together cover\nthe entirety of the totality to be theoretically determined.\n\u201cWherever we can construct concepts that, through their\ndeterminations (i.e., their limitations), do not merely negate, but\nthey simultaneously determine positively the negated component that is\nmissing from the whole, we can think in terms of alternatives. In so\ndoing we are able to grasp conceptually, through a kind of detour, a\nwhole that cannot be grasped through concepts in a direct fashion. This\nis because we can construct two concepts, under which every element\nbelonging to the whole necessarily falls\u201d (Rickert 1934b, 34). We\nalready encountered heterological pairs of concepts in the previous\nsections, for instance, the transcendental-psychological and the\ntranscendental-logical paths in the theory of knowledge and\ngeneralizing and individualizing concept formation in the theory of\nscience (see above.) In both cases the two opposite concepts, if taken\ntogether, circumscribe a totality: in the first case, the totality of\nepistemology, and, in the second case, the totality of scientific\nmethods in empirical research. The \u2018test\u2019 for successful\nheterological reasoning is that the negation of one of the two related\nconcepts results positively into the other concept, so that one can be\na priori certain that any item not falling under the first\nconcept necessarily falls under the second concept. As an\nexample Rickert illustrates how to determine heterologically the\ntotality of bodies (Rickert 1934b, 42). We can start with the thesis\n\u2018organic living bodies\u2019 and if we proceed to negate it we\nsee that the merely negative concept \u2018~ organic living\nbodies\u2019 immediately results in the positive concept \u2018dead\nmechanical bodies\u2019. Taken together the two concepts amount to a\nsuccessful theoretical grasp of the whole \u2018bodies\u2019. We can\nsee with evidence that within the totality \u2018bodies\u2019,\nwhatever body does not fall under the category \u2018organic living\nbody\u2019 necessarily falls under the category \u2018dead mechanical\nbody\u2019. Using heterology philosophy can reflect upon the world as\na whole in terms of \u201cworld-alternatives\u201d (Rickert 1934b,\n42) and set out to determine what pair of concepts is best suited to\nencompass the totality of what is. As we know from previous sections,\nRickert contends that the pair of concepts nature/psyche does not\nwithstand the heterological test, in that what is not nature can be\neither psyche or timelessly valid value. Ultimately\nfor Rickert the correct heterology in terms of which we can approach\nphilosophically the world as a whole is reality/value (Rickert 1913,\n11). This is because whatever is not an empirical reality (be\nit physical or psychic) lies necessarily in the sphere of value and\nvice versa. Once this broad categorization of the world as whole is\nestablished, philosophy can set out to determine more specifically the\nsubordinated wholes out of which the world as a whole is constituted\nand to articulate meaningfully their mutual relations.\n",
