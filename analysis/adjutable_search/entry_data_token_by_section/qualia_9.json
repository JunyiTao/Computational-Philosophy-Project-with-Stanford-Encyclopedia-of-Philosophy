    "main_text": "Illusionism about Qualia\n10. Illusionism about Qualia\n\nAccording to illusionists (Dennett 2019, 2020; Frankish 2016; Kammerer\n2021), conscious experience is an illusion. It certainly seems to us\nthat conscious experiences, and thus qualia (at least in sense (1) of\nthe four senses distinguished at the beginning of this entry) exist,\nbut in reality there are no such things. Qualia are like Santa Claus\nand the Easter Bunny (Dennett 2020). It is not being denied here that\nthrough the use of our senses, we genuinely encounter a wide range of\nqualities, for example, in perception, colors, auditory qualities such\nas pitch and loudness, various textures and aromas. But the qualities\nso encountered are not properties of experiences; for we do not\ngenuinely undergo any experiences. To be sure, when we introspect, it\ncertainly seems to us that we are the subjects of experiences with\nwidely varying phenomenal character. But we are wrong. \n\nThere is a possible weaker version of this view under which it is only\nqualia in senses (2)\u2013(4) that are being repudiated. And in some\npassages, some adherents of illusionism seem inclined to endorse this\nalternative. Frankish, for example, holds that we are under an\nillusion in thinking that when we introspect, we come across special,\nprivate qualities. But he also says that consciousness is a matter of\nbeing related to the world in various informational and reactive ways.\nThis suggests that he holds that consciousness really does exist and\nthus also qualia in sense (1). Still, there are other passages in\nFrankish that endorse the unqualified line, and overall he seems to\naccept the strong illusionist view. \n\nThis position is not easy to take seriously; for what could be more\nobvious than the existence of conscious experience? Adherents of the\nview may respond that introspection simply leads us astray. On the\nbasis of introspection, we believe that we undergo experiences (states\nwith qualia in sense (1)), but the beliefs so formed are false. What\nwould help strong illusionism here is a theory of introspection which\ncan explain the apparent absurdity of the view. Such a theory is\nproposed in Kammerer 2021. \n",
