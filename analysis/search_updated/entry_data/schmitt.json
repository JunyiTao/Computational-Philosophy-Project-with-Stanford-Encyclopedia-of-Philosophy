    "main_text": "\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\n\nCarl Schmitt\u2019s early career as an academic lawyer falls into the last\nyears of the Wilhelmine Empire. (See for Schmitt\u2019s life and career:\nBendersky 1983; Balakrishnan 2000; Mehring 2009.) But Schmitt wrote\nhis most influential works, as a young professor of\nconstitutional law in Bonn and later in Berlin, during the\nWeimar-period: Political Theology, presenting Schmitt\u2019s\ntheory of sovereignty, appeared in 1922, to be followed in 1923 by The\nCrisis of Parliamentary Democracy, which attacked the\nlegitimacy of parliamentary government. In 1927, Schmitt published the\nfirst version of his most famous work, The Concept of the\nPolitical, defending the view that all true politics is based on\nthe distinction between friend and enemy. The culmination of Schmitt\u2019s\nwork in the Weimar period, and arguably his greatest achievement, is\nthe 1928 Constitutional Theory, which systematically applied\nSchmitt\u2019s political theory to the interpretation of the Weimar\nconstitution. During the political and constitutional crisis of the\nlater Weimar Republic Schmitt published Legality and\nLegitimacy, a clear-sighted analysis of the breakdown of\nparliamentary government in Germany, as well as The Guardian of the\nConstitution, which argued that the president as the head of the\nexecutive, and not a constitutional court, ought to be recognized as\nthe guardian of the constitution. In these works from the later Weimar\nperiod, Schmitt\u2019s declared aim to defend the Weimar constitution is at\ntimes barely distinguishable from a call for constitutional revision\ntowards a more authoritarian political framework (Dyzenhaus 1997,\n70\u201385; Berthold 1999; Kennedy 2004, 154\u201378; Breuer 2012).\n\n\nThough Schmitt had not been a supporter of National Socialism before\nHitler came to power, he sided with the Nazis after 1933. Schmitt\nquickly obtained an influential position in the legal profession and\ncame to be perceived as the \u2018Crown Jurist\u2019 of National\nSocialism.  (R\u00fcthers 1990; Mehring 2009, 304\u2013436) He\ndevoted himself, with undue enthusiasm, to such tasks as the defence\nof Hitler\u2019s extra-judicial killings of political opponents (PB\n227\u201332) and the purging of German jurisprudence of Jewish\ninfluence (Gross 2007; Mehring 2009, 358\u201380). But Schmitt was\nousted from his position of power within legal academia in 1936, after\ninfighting with academic competitors who viewed Schmitt as a turncoat\nwho had converted to Nazism only to advance his career. There is\nconsiderable debate about the causes of Schmitt\u2019s willingness to\nassociate himself with the Nazis. Some authors point to Schmitt\u2019s\nstrong ambition and his opportunistic character but deny ideological\naffinity (Bendersky 1983, 195\u2013242; Schwab 1989). But a strong\ncase has been made that Schmitt\u2019s anti-liberal jurisprudence, as well\nas his fervent anti-semitism, disposed him to support the Nazi regime\n(Dyzenhaus 1997, 85\u2013101; Scheuerman 1999). Throughout the later\nNazi period, Schmitt\u2019s work focused on questions of international law.\nThe immediate motivation for this turn seems to have been the aim to\njustify Nazi-expansionism. But Schmitt was interested in the wider\nquestion of the foundations of international law, and he was convinced\nthat the turn towards liberal cosmopolitanism in 20th century\ninternational law would undermine the conditions of stable and\nlegitimate international legal order. Schmitt\u2019s theoretical work on\nthe foundations of international law culminated in The Nomos of\nthe Earth, written in the early 1940\u2019s, but not published before\n1950. Due to his support for and involvement with the Nazi\ndictatorship, Schmitt was briefly detained and interrogated at the end\nof the war as a potential defendant in the Nuremberg trials (ECS; AN),\nthe legitimacy of which he impugned in a legal brief prepared for the\ndefense of the German industrialist Friedrich Flick (IC). The\nobstinately unrepentant Schmitt was not allowed to return to an\nacademic job after 1945 (Mehring 2009, 438\u201363). But he\nnevertheless remained an important figure in West Germany\u2019s\nconservative intellectual scene to his death in 1985 (van Laak 2002)\nand enjoyed a considerable degree of clandestine influence elsewhere\n(Scheuerman 1999, 183\u2013251; M\u00fcller 2003).\n Unsurprisingly, the significance and value of Schmitt\u2019s works is\nsubject to heated controversy (Caldwell 2005). A group of authors\nsympathetic to Schmitt argue that Schmitt\u2019s analysis of liberal\nconstitutionalism during the Weimar period is separable from his\nsupport for National Socialism and that it constitutes an insightful\nand important analysis of the political presuppositions of a\nwell-functioning liberal constitutional system (Bendersky 1983; Schwab\n1989; Gottfried 1990; Kennedy 2004; Schupmann 2017). From the left, Schmitt\u2019s work is\nsometimes taken to illustrate the affinities between a purely economic\nliberalism and political authoritarianism (Mauss 1980; Cristi 1998).\nThe view that the Schmitt of the Weimar period can be read as a\ndefender of liberal order has been questioned by authors who stress\nthe continuity between Schmitt\u2019s conceptions of law, sovereignty, and\ndemocracy and fascist ideology (Wolin 1992; Dyzenhaus 1997; Scheuerman\n1999). However, engagement with Schmitt is nevertheless considered to\nbe important. It has been argued that Rawlsian political liberalism is\nvulnerable to Schmitt\u2019s critique of liberalism due to its\nunwillingness to base itself explicitly on a liberal conception of the\ngood (Dyzenhaus 1997, 218\u201358) or due to its refusal to recognize\nthe antagonistic nature of politics (Mouffe 1999b). Moreover,\nSchmitt\u2019s views on sovereignty and emergency powers are often seen as\nthe intellectual basis of contemporary calls for a strong executive\npower unhampered by constraints of legality (Dyzenhaus 2006,\n35\u201354; Scheuerman 2006; Posner and Vermeule 2010,\n3\u201324). Finally, there are an increasing number of authors who\nconcentrate on particular arguments of Schmitt\u2019s that are seen as\nworth developing in a systematic context. Two focal points of recent\ninterest are Schmitt\u2019s theory of popular sovereignty (Arato 1995;\nLindahl 2007; Kalyvas 2008, 79\u2013186; Loughlin 2010, 209\u201337;\nKahn 2011; Colon-Rios 2012, 79\u2013101; Minkkinen 2013; Vinx 2013a)\nand his conception of international order (Odysseos and Petito 2007;\nSlomp 2009; Legg 2011; Benhabib, 2012; Vinx 2013b; Hathaway and Shapiro 2017, chapter 10).\n2. Sovereignty and Dictatorship\n\n\nModern liberal constitutions do not acknowledge a bearer of sovereign\nauthority, and modern legal and constitutional theory has often tried\nto dispense with the concept. But Schmitt argues, in Political\nTheology, that such attempts to get rid of sovereignty cannot be\nsuccessful. In Schmitt\u2019s view, there can be no functioning legal order\nwithout a sovereign authority (PT 5\u201335; Dyzenhaus 1997,\n42\u201351; McCormick 1997, 121\u201356; Hofmann 2002, 49\u201364;\nKennedy 2004, 54\u201391; Kahn 2011, 31\u201361; Croce and Salvatore\n2013, 13\u201329; Vinx 2015). According to Schmitt, liberal constitutionalists\ntypically hold that all legitimate particular acts of state must apply\ngeneral legal norms, so that people are subject only to the\ndeterminate and predictable demands of the law, not to the potentially\narbitrary authority of persons (PT 18\u201326; see also CT\n169\u201396, CPD 33\u201350). This view overlooks, Schmitt argues,\nthat general legal norms often fail to provide determinate guidance\nwithout considerable interpretation and interstitial legislation (PT\n29\u201335; GU 21\u201343). In order for the law to become\neffective, there needs to be an authority that decides how to apply\ngeneral legal rules to concrete cases and how to deal with problems of\ncontested interpretation or under-determination. However, the material\ncontent of the law does not itself determine who is to interpret and\nto apply it. Hence, a sovereign authority prior to the law is needed\nto decide how to apply general legal norms to particular cases (PT\n29\u201335).\n This argument appears to assume that all legal norms are material\nnorms providing substantive grounds of legal decision. But modern\nlegal systems typically contain norms of competence in addition to\nmaterial norms. Hence, it seems that the view that all legitimate\npolitical authority depends on legal authorization is not as\nindefensible as Schmitt suggests (Kaufmann 1988, 337\u201345). The\nlaw can determine, for any material legal norm, which person or\ninstitution has the competence to interpret and apply it. Subjects of\nthe law may admittedly have to accept that a final decision might turn\nout to be binding even though wrong. And in this limited sense,\nSchmitt is right to appeal to Hobbes\u2019s dictum that it is authority and\nnot truth that makes the law.  (PT 33\u20134) But that a legal\nsystem, through its norms of competence, provides for the\nauthoritative interpretation of its material legal norms hardly\nentails that it must contain a sovereign in the traditional\nunderstanding of that term. Schmitt\u2019s implicit reply to this objection\nclaims that the applicability of legal norms presupposes a general\ncondition of social normality. Legal norms, Schmitt argues, cannot be\napplied to a chaos. They require a \u201chomogeneous medium.\u201d\n(PT 13) No legal norm, in Schmitt\u2019s view, can govern an extreme case\nof emergency or an absolute state of exception. In a completely\nabnormal situation, the continued application of the law through the\nnormal administrative and judiciary channels is going to lead to\nhaphazard and unpredictable results, while preventing effective action\nto end the emergency (PT 13; GU 44\u2013114; Scheuerman 1996; Hofmann\n2002, 17\u201333). If the applicability of material legal norms\npresupposes a condition of normality, Schmitt assumes, a polity must\nbe entitled to decide whether to suspend the application of its law on\nthe ground that the situation is abnormal. Hence Schmitt\u2019s famous\ndefinition of sovereignty, according to which the sovereign is he who\ndecides on the state of exception: If there is some person or\ninstitution, in a given polity, capable of bringing about a total\nsuspension of the law and then to use extra-legal force to normalize\nthe situation, then that person or institution is the sovereign in\nthat polity (PT 5). Any legal order, Schmitt bluntly concludes, is\nbased on a sovereign decision and not on a legal norm (PT 10,\n12\u20133).\n\n\nOne might reply to this line of thought that it is perfectly\npossible to establish legal conditions for the declaration of a state\nof emergency as well as legal constraints on the permissible means of\ndealing with an emergency. Schmitt argues, though, that attempts to\nlegalize the exceptional situation are doomed to failure. It is\nimpossible to anticipate the nature of future emergencies and to\ndetermine in advance what means might be necessary to deal with them.\nAs a result, the positive law can at best determine who is to decide\nwhether there is an emergency that requires a wholesale suspension of\nthe law. But the sovereign decision cannot be guided by existing\nmaterial law (PT 11\u20132). In Schmitt\u2019s view, it is not even necessary for\nthe law to determine who can take a decision on the exception. There\ncan be a sovereign authority, in a jurisprudentially relevant sense,\neven where such an authority is not recognized by positive\nconstitutional law. All that matters is whether there is a person or\ninstitution that possesses the ability, as a matter of fact, to take a\ndecision on the exception. If a sovereign, so understood, exists, its\nauthority to suspend the law does not stand in need of positive legal\nrecognition, since the law\u2019s applicability itself depends on a\nsituation of normality secured by the sovereign (PT 12\u20133). What about\ncases, though, where sovereignty is not just unrecognized in positive\nlaw but where there is no one, as a matter of fact, who could\nsuccessfully take a decision to suspend the law altogether? This\ncondition seems to apply in many contemporary western democracies.\nPerhaps such polities are ill-prepared to deal with radical\nemergencies. But it would be implausible to conclude that they do not\npossess a legal order. Schmitt\u2019s full response to this objection will\nonly become clear from his discussion of \u2018the political.\u2019 The objection\nsuggests, however, that Schmitt\u2019s claims about sovereignty cannot\nplausibly be understood as claims about the presuppositions of the mere\nfactual existence of a legal system. Schmitt must be arguing that\nwherever the situation of normality or homogeneity that makes the\nresults of the application of law determinate and predictable is no\nlonger guaranteed by a sovereign, the positive legal system, consisting\nof material norms and of positive norms of competence, can no longer be\nlegitimate (Mauss 1980, 81\u2013121; Scheuerman 1999, 15\u201337; Hofmann\n2002).\n If the sovereign\u2019s decision on the exception is not subject to any\nmaterial legal constraint, the power to decide on the state of\nexception is tantamount to the power to decide what should count as a\nstate of exception (PT 13; Norris 2007). A sovereign\u2019s view on this\nissue, however, must be responsive to prevailing social attitudes. If\nit were not, a sovereign could hardly possess the factual capability\nto suspend the law and to act successfully against the perceived\nemergency. To do so, his decision will need to be supported by a\nsufficiently large and powerful constituency. Nevertheless, the need\nfor sovereign decision will be greatest in a society torn by serious\nideological or social conflict. And if there is no unanimity among\nsocial groups as to what situation to perceive as normal or\nexceptional, the sovereign decision will inevitably have to side with\none group\u2019s conception of normality against that of another. The\nsovereign creation of a condition of normality, in other words,\nconstitutes a community\u2019s political identity and it is likely to do so\nthrough the forcible suppression of those whose conception of\nnormality differs from the sovereign\u2019s (D 132\u201347). The question\nof the legitimacy of law thus turns on the question of the legitimacy\nof an identity-constituting sovereign exercise of foundational\nviolence.\n\n\nSchmitt admits that the principle of democracy is the only principle\nof legitimacy that is available as an ideological basis for a\ncontemporary constitution (PT 50\u20132; CPD 22\u201332). If\nSchmitt\u2019s conception of sovereignty is to be defensible, it must\ntherefore be given a democratic interpretation. But it is difficult to\nsee how this could be possible. The only candidate for sovereignty in\na democratic polity is the popular sovereign, composed of politically\nequal citizens. A popular sovereign, it seems, cannot be a Schmittian\nsovereign, as it will only be able to decide under existing\nconstitutional rules that determine how the people as a collective are\nto form a unified will.  Schmitt prepared the groundwork for a\nsolution to this problem in Dictatorship, his historical\nstudy of the development of the institution of dictatorship (McCormick\n1997, 121\u201356; Cristi 1998 108\u201325; Kalyvas 2008,\n88\u2013126; Kelly 2016).\n Dictatorial power in its original, Roman form is a formally\ndelegated and time-limited power to defend an already existing\nrepublican constitution through the use of extra-legal force (D\nxlii\u2013xliv, 1\u201319). A Roman dictator, then, was clearly not a sovereign\nin Schmitt\u2019s sense of the term. In the course of modern constitutional\nhistory, however, the institution of dictatorship, Schmitt claims,\nfused with sovereignty, and this fusion related sovereignty to\ndemocracy. The first step towards this fusion, in Schmitt\u2019s account,\nwas the use of commissarial dictatorship in the early modern\nabsolutist state. The absolutist sovereign did possess the sovereign\npower to decide on the exception, and was thus capable of authorizing\ncommissars to use dictatorial methods in his name. But the notions of\ndictatorship and sovereignty were not yet fused. The commissarial\ndictators of the absolutist sovereign were mere agents of the\nsovereign and did not themselves possess the power to decide on the\nexception. The absolutist sovereign, in turn, though he had the power\nto decide on the exception, was not himself a dictator; first of all\nsince he did not decide under someone else\u2019s but by his own authority,\nand secondly because he was of course expected to rely on legal\ngovernance as his normal mode of operation (D 20\u201333). But the\nrelation between sovereignty and dictatorship changed in the French\nrevolution. The revolutionary governments relied heavily on\ndictatorial action to create a new situation of normality that would\nallow a new constitution to come into force. The revolutionary\ngovernments, like the absolutist sovereign, claimed the power to\ndecide on the exception, but they did not claim to be\nsovereign. Rather, they claimed to exercise the authority to decide on\nthe exception in the name of the French people, even while they were\nruling the French people by the use of dictatorial methods (D\n132\u201347). Sovereignty and dictatorship had become fused in the\nnovel institution of sovereign dictatorship: A sovereign dictator is a\ndictator who does not defend an already existing constitution but\nattempts to create a new one and who does so not by his own authority\nbut in the name of the people (D 112\u201331).\n\n\nSovereign dictatorship, in Schmitt\u2019s view, is an eminently\ndemocratic institution. It can exist only where it has become possible\nto take a sovereign decision on the exception in the name of the\npeople. Sovereignty, Schmitt concludes, is not just compatible with\ndemocracy but central to it, as it is exercised whenever and wherever a\ndemocratic constitution is founded (CT 109\u201310, 265\u20136; CPD 32). The fact\nthat a democratic constitution cannot endow a particular person with\npermanent sovereign authority does not entail that the possibility of a\ngenuine sovereign decision on the exception has disappeared. It merely\nimplies that a decision on the exception in the democratic state must\ntake the form of an exercise of the people\u2019s constituent power.\n3. The Concept of the Political and the Critique of Liberalism\n\n\nThe sovereign dictator has the power, in taking the decision on the\nexception, to set aside the positive legal and constitutional order in\nits entirety and to create a novel positive legal and constitutional\norder, together with a situation of social normality that fits it. It\nfollows that the sovereign dictator cannot base his claim to be acting\nin the name of the people on any kind of formal authorization. If the\nold constitution no longer exists and the new one is not yet in force,\nthere is no formal procedure for generating a public will. And yet, the\nsovereign dictator claims to exercise the constituent power of the\npeople. What is more, the constitutional order he is to create is to be\nconsidered as legitimate since it rests on the people\u2019s right to give\nitself a constitution (CT 136\u20139). Schmitt\u2019s view assumes that it is\npossible to speak of the existence of a people in advance of the\ncreation of any positive constitutional framework. Schmitt therefore\nhas to explain what it means for a people to exist prior to any\nconstitutional framework, and he has to give an account of how the\npeople\u2019s political existence prior to any constitutional framework can\nground a sovereign dictatorship.\n\n\nSchmitt\u2019s The Concept of the Political phrases the answer to this\nquestion as an account of the nature of \u2018the political.\u2019\n(Sartori 1989; Gottfried 1990, 57\u201382; Meier 1998; Hofmann 2002,\n94\u2013116; Mehring 2003; Kennedy 2004, 92\u2013118; Slomp 2009, 21\u201337; Schupmann 2017, 69\u2013105)\nSchmitt famously claims that \u201cthe specific political distinction\n\u2026 is that between friend and enemy.\u201d (CP 26) The\ndistinction between friend and enemy, Schmitt elaborates, is\nessentially public and not private. Individuals may have personal\nenemies, but personal enmity is not a political phenomenon.  Politics\ninvolves groups that face off as mutual enemies (CP 28\u20139). Two\ngroups will find themselves in a situation of mutual enmity if and\nonly if there is a possibility of war and mutual killing between\nthem. The distinction between friend and enemy thus refers to the\n\u201cutmost degree of intensity \u2026 of an association or\ndissociation.\u201d (CP 26, 38) The utmost degree of association is\nthe willingness to fight and die for and together with other members\nof one\u2019s group, and the ultimate degree of dissociation is the\nwillingness to kill others for the simple reason that they are members\nof a hostile group (CP 32\u20133).\n\n\nSchmitt believes that political enmity can have many different\norigins. The political differs from other spheres of value in that it\nis not based on a substantive distinction of its own. The ethical, for\nexample, is based on a distinction between the morally good and the\nmorally bad, the aesthetic on a distinction between the beautiful and\nthe ugly, and the economical on a distinction between the profitable\nand the unprofitable. The political distinction between friend and\nenemy is not reducible to these other distinctions or, for that matter,\nto any particular distinction \u2014 be it linguistic, ethnic,\ncultural, religious, etc. \u2014 that may become a marker of\ncollective identity and difference (CP 25\u20137). It is possible, for\ninstance, to be enemies with members of a hostile group whom one judges\nto be morally good. And it is equally possible not to be engaged in a\nrelationship of mutual enmity with a group whose individual members one\njudges to be bad. The same holds, Schmitt thinks, for all other\nsubstantive distinctions that may become markers of identity and\ndifference.\n\n\nThis is not to say, however, that one\u2019s conception of moral goodness\nor badness, for instance, will never play a role in a relationship of\npolitical enmity. Any distinction that can serve as a marker of\ncollective identity and difference will acquire political quality if it\nhas the power, in a concrete situation, to sort people into two\nopposing groups that are willing, if necessary, to fight against each\nother (CP 37\u20138). Whether a particular distinction will come to play\nthis role is not determined by its own intrinsic significance but by\nwhether a group of people relies on it to define its own collective\nidentity and comes to think of that identity, as based on that\ndistinction, as something that might have to be defended against other\ngroups by going to war. Since the political is not tied to any\nparticular substantive distinction, Schmitt argues, it is na\u00efve to\nassume that the political will disappear once conflicts arising from a\nparticular distinction no longer motivate opposing groups to fight.\nPolitical identification is likely to latch on to another distinction\nthat will inherit the lethal intensity of political conflict (See ND).\nBut wherever a distinction has political quality, it will be the\ndecisive distinction and the community constituted by it will be the\ndecisive social unit. Since the political community is the social unit\nthat can dispose of people\u2019s lives, it will be able, where it exists,\nto assert its superiority over all other social groups within its\nconfines and to rule out violent conflict among its members (CP\n37\u201345).\n\n\nSchmitt claims that one cannot judge, from an external perspective,\nthat a group is morally unjustified in defining its own identity in a\ncertain way and to introduce political enmity, with the attendant\npossibility of killing, to preserve that identity. Only members of a\ngroup are in a position to decide, from the perspective of an\nexistentially affected participant, whether the otherness of another\ngroup amounts to a threat to their own form of life and thus\npotentially requires to be fought (CP 27; See also CT 76\u20137, 136).\nSchmitt\u2019s reasoning implicitly relies on a collectivist version of the\nlogic of self-defence. The decision whether someone else\u2019s behaviour\nconstitutes a threat to one\u2019s own life, in some concrete situation, and\nthe decision whether it is necessary to use reactive or even\npre-emptive violence to remove or to escape that threat, cannot be\ndelegated to a third person. A group that perceives its own existence\nto be threatened by some other group, Schmitt argues, finds itself in\nan analogous position. The possibility of third-party mediation is\ntherefore ruled out in a truly political conflict (CP 45\u201353).\n\n\nA political community exists, then, wherever a group of people are\nwilling to engage in political life by distinguishing themselves from\noutsiders through the drawing of a friend-enemy distinction (CP 38,\n43\u20134). A group\u2019s capability to draw the distinction between friend and\nenemy does not require, Schmitt holds, that the group already possess a\nformal organization allowing for rule-governed collective\ndecision-taking. A people, thus, will have an existence prior to all\nlegal form as long as there is a sense of shared identity strong enough\nto motivate its members to fight and die for the preservation of the\ngroup. And as long as a people exists in this way it is capable,\nthrough its support, to sustain a sovereign dictatorship exercised in\nits name (CT 126\u201335).\n\n\nOf course, Schmitt\u2019s analogy between the collective and the\nindividual interest in self-preservation papers over an important\ndifference between the two cases. A political community does not enjoy\nsimple biological existence. It might die though all of its individual\nmembers continue to live. The drawing of a friend-enemy distinction,\ntherefore, is never a mere reaction to a threat to a form of existence\nthat is already given (but see Mouffe 1999, 49\u201350). Rather, it actively\nconstitutes the political identity or existence of the people and\ndetermines who belongs to the people. To belong one must identify with\nthe substantive characteristic, whatever it may be, that marks the\nidentity of the people, and one must agree that this characteristic\ndefines a form of life for the preservation of which one ought to be\nwilling to sacrifice one\u2019s own life, in the fight against those who\ndon\u2019t belong (CP 46).\n\n\nSchmitt realizes, of course, that it is possible for people who are\nnot willing to identify in this way to be legally recognized as\ncitizens, and to live law-abidingly, under the norms authorized by\nsome positive constitution. Liberal states, in Schmitt\u2019s view, have a\ntendency to fail to distinguish properly between friends and enemies,\nand thus to extend rights of membership to those who do not truly\nbelong to the political nation. In a liberal state, Schmitt fears, the\npolitical nation will slowly whither and die as a result of spreading\nde-politicization, it will succumb to internal strife, or it will be\noverwhelmed by external enemies who are more politically united (CP\n69\u201379; L 31\u201377). To avert these dangers, Schmitt suggests,\nit is necessary to make sure that the boundaries of the political\nnation and the boundaries of citizenship coincide. This demand\nexplains Schmitt\u2019s claim, in the first sentence of The Concept of\nthe Political, that the concept of the state presupposes the\nconcept of the political (CP 19).  The point of this remark is that a\nstate can only be legitimate if its legal boundaries embody a clear\nfriend-enemy distinction.\n\n\nIn order to achieve this aim, Schmitt clearly implies, a sovereign\ndictator, acting in the interstices between two periods of positive\nconstitutional order, must homogenize the community by appeal to a\nclear friend-enemy distinction, as well as through the suppression,\nelimination, or expulsion of internal enemies who do not endorse that\ndistinction (CP 46\u20138). In so doing, the sovereign dictator expresses\nthe community\u2019s understanding of what is normal or exceptional and of\nwho belongs, and he creates the homogeneous medium that Schmitt\nconsiders to be a precondition of the legitimate applicability of law.\nSchmitt observes that his concept of the political is not belligerent.\nIt does not glorify war, but merely claims that a community that is\ninterested in living politically needs to be willing to go to war if it\nperceives its political existence to be threatened (CP 32\u20135). But the\nintended analogy with self-defence seems to make little moral sense,\ngiven that Schmitt\u2019s conception of political existence demands the\nactive elimination of those whom a majority perceives as internal\nenemies, and even celebrates that elimination as the essential activity\nof the popular sovereign.\n Schmitt\u2019s understanding of the political provides the basis for\nhis critique of liberalism (Holmes 1993, 37\u201360; McCormick 1997;\nDyzenhaus 1997, 58\u201370; Kahn 2011). On a descriptive level,\nSchmitt claims that liberalism has a tendency to deny the need for\ngenuine political decision, to suggest that it is neither necessary\nnor desirable for individuals to form groups that are constituted by\nthe drawing of friend-enemy distinctions. Liberals believe that there\nare no conflicts among human beings that cannot be solved to\neveryone\u2019s advantage through an improvement of civilization,\ntechnology, and social organization or be settled, after peaceful\ndeliberation, by way of amicable compromise. As a result, liberalism\nis unable to provide substantive markers of identity that can ground a\ntrue political decision. Liberal politics, consequently, boils down to\nthe attempt to domesticate the polity, in the name of the protection\nof individual freedom, but it is unable to constitute political\ncommunity in the first place (CP 69\u201379; CPD 33\u201350).\n If this is a correct account of the character of liberal ideology\nand of the aims of liberal politics, Schmitt is right to conclude that\nliberalism has a tendency to undermine a community\u2019s political\nexistence, as he understands it. But in order for this observation to\namount to a critique of liberalism, Schmitt needs to explain why a\nliberal subversion of the political would be undesirable. Schmitt\u2019s\npolitical works contain a number of rather different answers to this\nquestion. A first line of thought emphasizes, with appeal to Hobbes,\nthat a state can only be legitimate as long as it retains the capacity\nto offer protection to its members (for Schmitt\u2019s engagement with\nHobbes see McCormick 1994; Tralau 2011; and Schmitt\u2019s L; SM; VR). And\na state that has suffered a subversion of the political, induced by\nliberal ideology, Schmitt argues, will be unable to offer protection\nto its members, because it will fail to protect them from the indirect\nrule of pluralist interest-groups that have successfully colonized the\nstate (LL 17\u201336, L 65\u201377) and, more importantly, because\nit will lack the power to protect them from external enemies (CP\n51\u20133). If a people is no longer willing to decide between friend\nand enemy the most likely result will not be eternal peace but anarchy\nor subjection to another group that is still willing to assume the\nburdens of the political.  This first answer, however, is not\nSchmitt\u2019s last word on why liberal de-politicization is\nundesirable. Schmitt seems to admit that a global hegemon might one\nday be able to enforce a global de-politicization, by depriving all\nother communities of the capacity to draw their own friend-enemy\ndistinctions, or that liberalism might one day attain global cultural\nhegemony, such that people will no longer be interested in drawing\nfriend-enemy distinctions (CP 35, 57\u20138). Schmitt, then, cannot rest\nhis case against liberal de-politicization on the claim that it is an\nunrealistic goal. He needs to argue that it is undesirable even if it\ncould be achieved (Strauss 2007).\n\n\nSchmitt replies to this challenge that a life that does not involve\nthe friend-enemy distinction would be shallow, insignificant, and\nmeaningless. A completely de-politicized world would offer human\nbeings no higher purpose than to increase their consumption and to\nenjoy the frolics of modern entertainment. It would reduce politics to\na value-neutral technique for the provision of material amenities. As\na result, there would no longer be any project or value that\nindividuals are called upon to serve, whether they want to or not, and\nthat can give their life a meaning that transcends the satisfaction of\nprivate desires (CP 35, 57\u20138; RK 21\u20137; PR\n109\u201362; WS 85\u2013108). But that a world in which one does not have the\nopportunity to transcend one\u2019s interest in individual contentment in\nthe service of a higher value would be shallow and meaningless does\nnot suffice to establish that a willingness to kill or to die for a\npolitical community will confer meaning on a life, much less that it\nis the only thing that can do so.  When Schmitt claims that the\ndefence of the political is the only goal that could possibly justify\nthe killing of others and the sacrifice of one\u2019s own life (CP 35;\n48\u20139) he assumes without argument that the life of political\ncommunity, as he understands it, is uniquely and supremely\nvaluable.\n\n\nSome interpreters have explained Schmitt\u2019s hostility towards liberal\nde-politicization as being grounded in the view that a willingness to\ndistinguish between friend and enemy is a theological duty (Mehring\n1989; Meier 1998; Groh, 1991; Herrero 2015, 143\u2013177; Vatter 2016). Schmitt argues in Political\nTheology that all key concepts of the modern doctrine of the\nstate are secularized theological concepts, which suggests that a\npolitical theory that continues to use these concepts needs a\ntheological foundation (PT 36\u201352). In The Concept of the\nPolitical, Schmitt claims that all true political theorists base\ntheir views on a negative anthropology which holds that man is by\nnature evil and licentious, and thus needs to be kept in check by a\nstrong state capable of drawing a friend-enemy distinction if there is\nto be social order (CP 58\u201368). This latter thesis, Schmitt\nadmits, can take a secular form, as in Hobbes or Machiavelli, as the\npurely descriptive claim that man is inherently dangerous to man. But\nSchmitt suggests that this secular version of a negative political\nanthropology is open to be transformed into the view that man, though\nby nature dangerous, is perfectible or into the view that man\u2019s\ndangerous behavior is a mere contingent consequence of a mistaken form\nof social organization (PT 53\u201366; L 31\u20139). In order to\nestablish a permanent need for political authority, negative political\nanthropology must be given a theological reading that portrays the\ndangerous nature of man as an irrevocable result of original sin.\nLiberal de-politicization, from this perspective, is to be rejected as\na sign of human pride that rebels against God, who alone, but only at\nthe end of history, can deliver humanity from political enmity.\n\n\nSchmitt himself admits that the theological grounding of politics is\nbased on an anthropological confession of faith (CP 58). And one is\ntempted to say that Schmitt\u2019s theory turns out to be philosophically\nirrelevant if this is really the last word. Schmitt would likely have\nreplied that the liberal assumption that man is perfectible, that\nhumanity can overcome political enmity, and that to do so is desirable,\nis also an article of faith. The theological partisan of the political,\nin Schmitt\u2019s view, is as justified in practicing his creed as the\nliberal cosmopolitan and to engage in a deliberate cultivation of\npolitical enmity (CPD 65\u201376). As long as the political theologian can\nmake sure that the friend-enemy distinction survives, liberals will be\nforced to enter the arena of the political and to go to war against the\npartisans of the political. And this fight, Schmitt hopes, is going to\nsecure the continuing existence of political enmity and prevent the\nvictory of liberal de-politicization (CP 36\u20137).\n4. Theory of Democracy and Constitutional Theory\n\n\nSchmitt\u2019s conception of politics tends to radically dissociate\ndemocracy from liberalism and, more controversially, from the\nconstituted, rule-bound practices of popular election and parliamentary\nlegislation that characterize the ordinary workings of modern\ndemocracy. How, then, did Schmitt apply his radical perspective to the\nsphere of constituted democratic politics in the Weimar Republic? (Valuable overviews in Dyzenhaus 1997; Kennedy 2004; Neumann 2015, 77\u2013304; Preuss 2016.)\n\n\nIn The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy, Schmitt understands\ndemocracy as the self-rule of the people. In a democratic polity, the\ndecisions taken by the rulers express the will of the people (CPD\n25\u20136). However, the principle of democracy, taken in the\nabstract, is open to different and competing interpretations. In\npolitical practice, the identity of the ruling will with the will of\nthe people is never a simple given. Rather, it is always the result of\nan act of identification. When political decisions are taken through\nmajority vote, the will of the majority is identified with the will of\nthe people, and every citizen is expected to obey regardless of\nwhether he voted with the majority (CPD 26\u201330). But what,\nSchmitt asks, is the basis of this identification? If a majority can\noverrule a minority, and identify its will with the will of the\npeople, why should it not be possible for the will of a minority to\nexpress the will of the people?  What if a group of democratic\nrevolutionaries want to establish a democracy in a society where most\npeople are opposed to the principle of democracy? Would they not be\njustified, from a democratic point of view, to abandon majority rule,\nto identify their own will with the true will of the people, and to\nsubject their compatriots to a re-educative dictatorship? Schmitt\nsuggests that such a dictatorship would still have to be considered\ndemocratic, since it still appeals to the idea that political rule\nought to be based on the will of the people (CPD 28\u201330). Once\none accepts this claim, the conclusion that Schmitt aims to establish\nin The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy will follow: The electoral\ninstitutions that we usually take to be paradigmatically democratic\nare not, in truth, any more intimately connected with the principle of\ndemocracy than a dictatorship in the name of the people. The latter was to be legitimated by plebiscites, initiated by a charismatic leader, in which the people, Schmitt argued, should be allowed to give or withhold approval, but never to initiate the question (CPD 32; VV). But this conclusion must surely be an overstatement. Even democratic\ndictatorship, however crucial to the establishment of democracy, is\nexceptional and limited in time. Hence, there must be a\ncharacteristically democratic condition of legal normality, and a\ntheory of democracy should tell us what it is.  Schmitt\u2019s apparent\nattempt to dissociate the idea of democracy from any particular method\nof will-formation fails to explain why the democratic tradition has\nconsidered institutional provisions like the election of officials or\nthe extension of the franchise to be characteristically\ndemocratic.\n\n\nSchmitt acknowledges this problem in his Constitutional\nTheory. The idea that legitimate political rule must make appeal\nto the will of the people, Schmitt now claims, is grounded in the\nvalue of political equality (CT 255\u201367). Political equality\ncommits us to the denial of natural differences in status among\ncitizens. Per se, no citizen has more of a right than any other\ncitizen else to hold political power.  Every citizen, therefore,\nshould participate on equal terms, as far as practically feasible, in\nthe exercise of political rule. What is more, where it is necessary to\nappoint public officials with special powers not shared by all\ncitizens, these officials must be appointed through periodical\nelections. The value of political equality, then, explains why certain\nforms of will formation are considered to be more intimately\nassociated with the idea of democracy than others (CT\n280\u20135). However, Schmitt\u2019s concession to the value of equality\ncomes with a twist. The political equality that constitutes a\npolitical community, Schmitt argues, cannot be based on the\nnon-exclusive equality of all human beings as moral persons. Every\npolitical community is based on a constitutive distinction between\ninsiders and outsiders or friends and enemies. A democratic political\ncommunity, as much as any other, must therefore rest on some marker of\nidentity and difference that can ground an exclusive form of political\nequality which will only apply to insiders (CT 257\u201364). Schmitt\ngoes on to define democracy as a political system characterized by the\nidentity of ruler and ruled. Ruler and ruled are identical if and only\nif the rulers and all the ruled share the substantive identity that\nthe community as a whole, in deciding who its enemies are, has chosen\nto turn into the basis of its political identity (CT 264\u20137; See\nalso CPD 8\u201317).\n\n\nIf all those who live together as legally recognized citizens of a\nconstituted democratic state happen to distinguish between friend and\nenemy in exactly the same way, the equal participation of all citizens\nin the political process and the electoral appointment of officials\nwould indeed be a requirement of democratic political justice. It\nwould be possible, moreover, to identify the outcomes of the political\nprocess with the will of the people, and to consider them\ndemocratically legitimate, even if some citizens find themselves in a\ntemporary minority. But the reason why it has become possible to\nidentify the outcomes of democratic procedure with the will of the\npeople is not to be sought in inherent virtues of democratic procedure\nitself. Rather, the identification is possible only in virtue of the\nprior identity of all citizens as members of a group constituted by a\nshared friend-enemy distinction (CPD 10\u201314; LL 27\u201328). If, contrary to\nour initial assumption, those who live together as legally recognized\ncitizens of a constituted democratic state do not share a political\nidentity in Schmitt\u2019s sense, the identity of the rulers with all the\nruled will no longer obtain, and the constituted democratic state will\nno longer be truly democratic. The rule of the majority will\ndegenerate into an illegitimate form of indirect rule of one social\nfaction over another (HV 73\u201391; LL 17\u201336; L\n65\u201377). Sovereign dictatorship, then, is still necessary to\ncreate the substantive equality that grounds the legitimate operation\nof constituted, rule-governed democratic politics.\n\n\nThe understanding of democracy so far outlined informs Schmitt\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Weimar constitution (Dyzenhaus 1997,\n38\u2013101; Caldwell 1997, 85\u2013119; Scheuerman 1999,\n61\u201384; Hofmann 2002, 117\u201352; Kennedy 2004,\n119\u201353; Neumann 2015, 77\u2013304; Preuss 2016; Schupmann 2017). A democratic constitution, Schmitt argues in his\nConstitutional Theory, is the product of an exercise of\nconstituent power on the part of a politically united people (CT\n75\u201377, 125\u201330, 140\u20136). The creation of a democratic\nconstitution must not be thought of along the lines of a social\ncontract, since it presupposes the prior existence of a people as a\npolitical unity, as explicated in the Concept of the\nPolitical (CT 112\u20133; B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde 1998). If the\npeople did not already exist, Schmitt reasons, it would not be able to\ngive itself a constitution, and a constitution not given by the people\nitself to itself would not be a democratic constitution. In giving\nitself a constitution a politically united people determines the\nconcrete form of its political existence, but it does not bring itself\ninto existence. Since a democratic constitution is a unilateral\ndetermination, on the part of an already existing people, of the\nconcrete form of its political existence, the people\u2019s constituent\npower must be inalienable. As long as a people exists it can always\ndecide to give itself a new constitution (CT 140\u20131). Schmitt\u2019s\ntheory of constituent power has recently received a lot of attention\nfrom authors who believe it might help to reinvigorate constituted\ndemocracy (Kalyvas 2008, 79\u2013186; Colon-Rios 2012).\n\n\nSchmitt recognizes that it would be implausible to assume that a\nwritten constitution represents a conscious choice of the popular\nsovereign down to its last detail. The revolution of the German people\nin 1918 that led to the creation of the Weimar constitution, for\nexample, expressed the German people\u2019s conscious decision for a\ndemocratic, republican, and federal state, committed to the principles\nof the rule of law, and endowed with a parliamentary system of\nlegislation and government (CT 77\u20138). But in addition to these\ngeneral principles of political and social order, the Weimar\nconstitution came to contain a large number of specific provisions\nthat do not reflect conscious decisions of the popular sovereign (CT\n82\u20138). Schmitt argues that it would be wrong to treat such\nparticular constitutional norms as possessing the same normative force\nas the people\u2019s decision for a concrete form of political existence,\nwhich is expressed in the basic principles implicit in the\nconstitution. It is wrong, therefore, to regard a constitution as\nnothing more than the set of all particular constitutional norms, and\nto assume that all these norms are equally subject to constitutional\namendment. Even where, as in Weimar, the positive constitution\nprovides a procedure that seems to allow for the amendment of any\nparticular constitutional norm, it is to be understood, Schmitt\nargues, that the core constitutional principles chosen by the\nconstituent power are not open to formal abrogation. To claim that\nthey are is to advocate a usurpation of the constituent power of the\npeople by a mere party or faction (CT 77\u201382, 147\u201358).\n\n\nSchmitt thinks that this argument will hold even where an initiative\nto amend the constitution requires a supermajority. Political\ndecision-taking on the basis of the simple majority rule is legitimate\nonly if citizens share a political identity, in which case they will\nalso agree on a set of constitutional fundamentals. Where they don\u2019t,\nthe identity of ruler and all ruled no longer obtains, and majority\nrule will consequently become a mere license for the oppression of\nthose who happen to be in the minority. Such oppression, Schmitt\nargues, does not become any more legitimate where a super-majoritarian\nrequirement is raised and met. That a numerical majority is relatively\nlarge and a numerical minority is relatively small does not entail,\nonce there is no longer a shared political identity, that we are any\ncloser to an identity between the ruler and all the ruled than in the\ncase of a simple majority (LL 39\u201358). Schmitt concludes that it\nwould be absurd to take the view that the formal procedures of\namendment provided by a democratic constitution can legitimately be\nused to overturn its constitutional fundamentals (LL\n85\u201394). Before 1933, Schmitt employed this argument to oppose a\nNazi seizure of power (Machtergreifung) in legal form\n(Bendersky 1983, 107\u201391). It should also be noted that his claim\nthat there must be limits to constitutional amendment in a democratic\nconstitution based on the principle of popular sovereignty, and that\nthese limits legitimate the notion of a \u2018militant democracy\u2019 that is\nwilling to curb individual rights to defend itself, has been very\ninfluential in postwar constitutional thought, in Germany and\nelsewhere (see Ehmke 1953, 33\u201353; Fox and Nolte 1995,\n18\u201320; Conrad 1999; Colon-Rios 2012, 126\u201351). However,\nSchmitt\u2019s constitutional theory did not amount to an unqualified\ndefence of liberal democracy. While Schmitt denies the possibility of\nchanging the fundamental nature of an established constitution from\nwithin, and decries the dangers of the tyranny of a mere numerical\nmajority, he nevertheless affirms the possibility of fundamental\nconstitutional change through sovereign dictatorship, and he makes it\nclear that the German people, in a renewed exercise of their\nconstituent power, might legitimately choose a non-liberal and\nnon-parliamentarian form of democracy (CT 75\u20137). The exclusionary\nnature of the friend-enemy distinction that is to be enforced through\nextra-legal sovereign dictatorship, to provide a basis for the normal\nfunctioning of the constitutional order, throws further doubt on the\ndemocratic nature of Schmitt\u2019s constitutional theory (see\nKraft\u2013Fuchs 1930; Vinx 2013a).\n\n\nSchmitt\u2019s ambiguous position towards the Weimar system was equally on\ndisplay in his interpretation of the dictatorial powers of the\npresident of the Weimar Republic under art. 48 of the Weimar\nconstitution (Dyzenhaus 1997, 70\u201385; Vinx 2016). By partially assimilating\nthe president to a sovereign dictator, Schmitt defended an unusually\nextensive interpretation of the president\u2019s authority that in effect\nsubjected all constitutional rights to the discretionary interference\nof the executive headed by the president (See DP). Liberal rights were\nto be respected, as the German people had chosen to create a liberal\nconstitution, but only on the condition that public order and security\nhad been secured. For Schmitt, individual freedoms, even where\nconstitutionally guaranteed, are to be regarded as concessions of the\nstate to the individual since they are subject, in the last instance,\nto suspension through a sovereign decision on the exception (CT\n80\u20131, 156\u20138, 235\u201352). Schmitt, moreover, vehemently\nfought against the idea that the protection of the constitution ought\nto be assigned to a constitutional court. A constitutional court,\nSchmitt argued, would either have to limit itself to uncontroversial\ncases in which constitutional law provides determinate guidance or\ntake upon itself the responsibility to determine the political\nidentity of the people.  But for a court to assume that responsibility\nwould, in Schmitt\u2019s view, have amounted to an illegitimate usurpation\nof the constituent power of the people, as much as an attempt to bring\nabout fundamental constitutional change through formal constitutional\namendment (HV 12\u201348; TV 26\u201341).\n\n\nSchmitt apparently hoped, throughout the Weimar Republic\u2019s years of\nrelative stability, that presidential dictatorship in defence of the\nexisting constitution might be sufficient to create a condition of\nnormality that would allow the Weimar Republic to function. But this\nhope was disappointed in the final crisis of the Weimar Republic.\nSchmitt\u2019s writings during that crisis started to toy with the view\nthat the president should attempt to assume a role much closer to full\nsovereign dictatorship than even Schmitt\u2019s own interpretation of art.\n48 would have permitted and to engineer an authoritarian\ntransformation of the positive constitution (LL 85\u201394). This\nproject failed when the Nazis managed to take power through the kind\nof abuse of constitutional procedure that Schmitt had warned against\n(Kennedy 2004, 154\u201383). After a very brief period of hesitation\nSchmitt nevertheless offered his services as a legal advisor to the\nNazis. He was careful to emphasize that the Machtergreifung amounted\nto a true revolution, despite its seemingly legal form, to maintain\nconsistency with his view that a constitution cannot undergo\nfundamental change through formal amendment (SBV 5\u20139), but he\nwas quick to translate his identitarian theory of democracy into the\nracialist idiom preferred by the Nazis (SBV 32\u201346) and started\nto advocate an institutionalist theory of law that was supposed to\ntake its bearings from the authentic form of life of the German people\n(TJT 47\u201357, 89\u201395). Schmitt himself presented this shift\nas a fundamental reorientation of his legal-theoretical approach from\na \u2018decisionist\u2019 perspective to \u2018concrete order thought\u2019. It is\ndoubtful, however, whether the term \u2018concrete order\u2019 designates more\nthan the situation of normality that Schmitt had always taken to be\nthe basis of determinate legality. His claim (or hope) was simply that\nthe Nazis have successfully restored normality (but see Croce and\nSalvatore 2013, 11\u201376).  The national socialist movement, in\nSchmitt\u2019s view, had managed to orchestrate an exercise of constituent\npower and to create a new constitution; one that was willing to draw\nuncompromising distinctions between the German people and its internal\nand external enemies. Given this description of the\nMachtergreifung, Schmitt\u2019s political and constitutional\ntheory seems to imply that Hitler\u2019s rule was perfectly legitimate. It\ntherefore seems unnecessary to postulate a radical discontinuity\nbetween Schmitt\u2019s views before and after 1933 (Dyzenhaus 1997,\n82\u2013101; Mauss 1998; Scheuerman 1999, 113\u201339; Hofmann 2002,\n152\u201388).\n5. Liberal Cosmopolitanism and the Foundations of International Order\n Schmitt\u2019s conception of the political grounds a distinctive\ninterpretation of democracy and constitutionalism in the domestic\nsphere. It led Schmitt to an equally distinctive account of the\nfoundations of international legality that has received increasing\nscholarly attention in recent years (Scheuerman 1999, 141\u201373;\nScheuerman 2006; Odysseos and Petito 2007; Axtmann 2007; Hooker 2009;\nSlomp 2009; Legg 2011; Benhabib 2012; Neumann 2015, 419\u2013492; Koskenniemi 2016; Hathaway and Shapiro 2017; Kalyvas 2018). Schmitt is a staunch defender\nof sovereignty, but he does not embrace a flat rejection of\ninternational legality. Rather, Schmitt appears concerned to outline\nthe conditions under which sovereign political communities, with\ndiffering political identities, can co-exist in a shared international\nlegal order.\n\n\nTwo important consequences for international theory of Schmitt\u2019s\nconception of politics are immediately obvious. First, it implies that\nevery true political community must claim a legally unrestricted ius\nad bellum. If the distinction between friend and enemy that\nconstitutes a group\u2019s political existence is not drawn by the group\nitself but by someone else, or if the decision whether to go to war in\na concrete situation is no longer taken by the group but by some third\nparty \u2014 be it a hegemonic state, an international organization,\nor an international court \u2014 the group no longer exists as an\nindependent political community (CP 45\u201353). The second key\nconsequence of Schmitt\u2019s conception of politics for international\ntheory follows from the claim that the political existence of a group\nmust be based on a particular identity that serves as the substance of\na friend-enemy distinction. Such an identity, of course, must differ\nfrom the identity of any other political community for the group in\nquestion to achieve a political identity of its own. It would be\nimpossible for there to be a plurality of political communities\n\u2014 and hence, since political community is only possible where a\ngroup has enemies, for there to be any political community \u2014 if\nthere were only one legitimate form of social organization or communal\nlife (CP 53\u20138). These two consequences of Schmitt\u2019s conception\nof politics imply two conditions of the legitimacy of international\norder, at least if one makes the assumption, with Schmitt, that\npolitical communities have an unconditional right to preserve their\nexistence (CP 48\u20139; CT 75\u20137).  Given this assumption, a\nlegitimate international order must be able to accommodate a plurality\nof political communities with different, self-determined political\nidentities. What is more, it must recognize as legitimate the ius ad\nbellum claimed by all groups that have successfully constituted\nthemselves as political communities. A conception of international\norder that violates any of these two conditions would be incompatible\nwith political existence and therefore illegitimate.\n\n\nThese demands on legitimate international order seem to be a recipe\nfor anarchy. Would it not have been better for Schmitt to admit that\nhis view implies a denial of international legal order? Schmitt\u2019s reply\nto this objection is twofold. On the one hand, he argues that there is\nat least one historical instance of a functioning international order\nthat lived up to his criteria of legitimacy. On the other hand, Schmitt\nclaims that the attempt to subject the use of force on the part of\npolitical communities to external legal constraint and control, apart\nfrom constituting an assault on the possibility of political existence,\nwill only lead to greater disorder and violence than we can expect to\nexperience in a system that recognizes the political.\n\n\nSchmitt\u2019s first reply is based on an interpretation of the nature of\nEuropean political order in the period from the establishment of the\nmodern sovereign state to the beginning of WWI. In Schmitt\u2019s account,\nthis period was not a period of mere anarchy. Rather, it was\ncharacterized by the existence of a public law governing the relations\nbetween European states, the ius publicum Europaeum (NE 140\u2013212). The\nmain pillar of the ius publicum Europaeum, according to Schmitt, was a\nstrict separation between the ius ad bellum and the ius in bello. On\nthe level of ius ad bellum, all independent states were recognized to\npossess the right to go to war on the basis of their own judgment of\njustice and necessity. The legal order of ius publicum Europaeum, in\neffect, did not distinguish between just and unjust war. Rather, both\nsides in a conflict between sovereign states were by default recognized\nas legitimate belligerents (NE 140\u201371). Moreover, since both states in\nany conflict were held to be legitimate belligerents, states not\ndirectly involved in a conflict were taken to possess the right to\nchoose to back either side or to remain neutral (DCW 53\u201374). This\nframework, Schmitt argues, allowed European states to bring about a\nhighly effective containment of the negative consequences of war, and\nthus of the dangers of political existence. The abstraction from the\njustice of war allowed states to make peace without being hampered by\nthe need to apportion moral blame. The freedom to side with either\nparty in a conflict, or else to remain neutral, allowed states to\ncontain conflicts by balancing or simply by staying out of the fight.\nMost importantly, however, the mutual recognition of legitimate\nbelligerency allowed for the effective enforcement of stringent\nconstraints on the permissible means of warfare on the level of ius in\nbello. Inter-statal warfare during the period of the jus publicum\nEuropaeum, according to Schmitt, distinguished carefully between\ncombatants and civilians and abstained from using methods of warfare\nthat might endanger the lives or the property of civilians (NE 142\u201343,\n165\u20138).\n\n\nThis containment of war, Schmitt claims, was premised on the\nwillingness to bracket the question of justice on the level of ius ad\nbellum. Once one takes the view that a war can be legitimate on one\nside, while being illegitimate on the other, one is forced to\nconclude, Schmitt argues, that it is morally wrong to grant the status\nof legitimate belligerency to those who are judged to fight without a\njust cause, and equally wrong to assume that they ought to enjoy the\nsame in bello-rights as those who fight justly (NE 320\u20132; CP\n54\u20137). Moreover, once one separates between legitimate and\nillegitimate belligerency, it will no longer be possible to argue that\nother states have the right to side with either belligerent or to\nremain neutral. Rather, third parties will be seen to have a duty to\nside with those who fight justly (DK 26\u201353). The abandonment of\nthe idea that all participants in a war among states are equally\nlegitimate belligerents, Schmitt concludes, inevitably undercuts the\ncontainment of war achieved in ius publicum Europaeum (PB\n286\u201390). Unsurprisingly, Schmitt rejected the project of\ncreating an international legal order based on a \u2018discriminating\nconcept of war\u2019 that would subject the use of force on the part\nof sovereign states to substantive criteria of moral legitimacy and\nexternal legal control. He regarded such developments as little more\nthan attempts on the part of the victorious western allies to brand\nany violent German effort to revise the outcomes of WWI as illegal and\nthus as unjust, and to give themselves license for the application of\nmeans of coercion and for the use of methods of warfare that would\nhave been considered as illegitimate in the context of mutually\nlegitimate belligerency (PB 184\u2013203; NE 259\u201380). Schmitt\nargued that international legalization on the model of just war theory\nwould not prevent coming wars. It would merely make them more total,\nas it would encourage opponents to regard each other as absolute\nenemies worthy of elimination (NE 309\u201322; Brown 2007; Slomp\n2009, 95\u2013111).\n\n\nHowever, Schmitt acknowledged that the era of ius publicum Europaeum\nhad come to an end after WWI, together with the global hegemony of the\nclassical European concert of sovereign states (GO\n101\u201311). Schmitt therefore aimed to assess the chances for the\nemergence of a new global order analogous in structure to ius publicum\nEuropaeum and he made an attempt, in The Nomos of the Earth,\nto explicate the presuppositions of the kind of international order\nexemplified by ius publicum Europaeum.  For it to be possible for\ngroups that are related by enmity nevertheless to co-exist in a shared\nframework which limits the consequences of war mutual enmity must be\nprevented from reaching the level of absolute enmity. Enmity, even\nwhile it may require one to defend one\u2019s own political existence\nagainst the enemy, must not require the complete destruction of the\nenemy\u2019s political and perhaps of his physical existence. Ius publicum\nEuropaeum, in Schmitt\u2019s view, had been capable of preventing absolute\nenmity through an alignment of friend-enemy distinctions with\nterritorial boundaries (Zarmanian 2006).  If the forms of life of two\nopposed political communities are each tied to and expressed in a\nparticular territory, then the two groups will be able, Schmitt\nargues, to spatialize the friend-enemy distinction between them (NE\n42\u20139). From the point of view of any one of the two groups, the\nprotection of its political existence will require it to repel any\nattempt on the part of the other group to dispossess it of its\nterritory. But it will not require the one group to interfere with or\nto destroy the political existence of the other group if to do so is\nunnecessary for the protection of its own territory. All political\nconflicts, under such circumstances, can be reduced to territorial\nconflicts, and this entails that all conflicts can in principle be\ncontained as long as it is possible to divide territory in a way that\nwill allow both groups to maintain their form of life (NE\n143\u20138).\n\n\nFor political conflicts to be reducible to territorial conflicts,\nopposing political communities must of course accept the principle of\nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of other political\ncommunities. The reduction of political conflict to territorial\nconflict would be impossible if political allegiances were spread out\nacross borders. If some of those who share the identity that we have\nmade into the basis of our political life live in a territory\ncontrolled by another political community we will have to concern\nourselves with their fate. If we perceive them to be oppressed by that\nother community, we may feel compelled to go to war for them, even if\nthe other community has not aggressed against our own territory. To\nterritorialize the friend-enemy distinction, hence, one must ensure\nthat all and only the people who share the same political identity live\nin the same territory (GO 86\u20138, 96\u2013101). Some political identities,\nhowever, do not lend themselves to a spatialization of the political. A\ncommunity whose political identity is premised on the promotion of\nliberal-humanitarian values which it takes to be universal, for\ninstance, must concern itself with the question whether other political\ncommunities respect those values and be willing to interfere if they\ndon\u2019t. It cannot accept a reduction of political conflict to\nterritorial conflict, as its political identity purports to be\nnon-exclusive. A global order on the model of ius publicum Europaeum\nwill therefore remain unattainable, and a global civil war\ncharacterized by absolute enmity will be unavoidable, Schmitt\nconcludes, as long as the world\u2019s foremost powers are committed to\nuniversalist ideologies that imply a rejection of the spatialization of\npolitical conflict (GO 90\u20135; VA 375\u201385).\n\n\nAs Schmitt would later point out in Theory of the Partisan,\nthe distinction between absolute and contained enmity gives rise to a\ndistinction between absolute, real, and conventional enemies (TP\n85\u201395; see also CP 36\u20137; Slomp 2009, 112\u201326). A\nconventional enemy is an enemy within an established system of\ncontainment, whereas a real enemy is an enemy that can be made, though\nperhaps only after conflict, to settle for a territorial\ndivision. Absolute enmity, by contrast, exists wherever there is a\nconflict that is not amenable to territorial settlement. In Schmitt\u2019s\nview, it is the powers who, for ideological reasons, refuse to accept\na spatialization of conflict that are to blame for absolute enmity and\nthe unbridled violence it entails. Those who are real enemies, but who\nneed not be each other\u2019s absolute enemies, then, have to find a way to\nrecognize each other, to divide the world among themselves, and to\nhold down political forces that must reject the territorialization of\npolitical conflict. Schmitt\u2019s The Nomos of the Earth,\naccordingly, portrayed the mutually recognized appropriation of the\nglobe by mutually non-intervening, territorially-based political\ncommunities as the true foundation of all legitimate international (and thus of national)\nlegal order (NE 42\u20139, 67\u201383; GO 77\u20139; see also Herrero 2015, 21\u201349). During the\nNazi-period, Schmitt applied this view to a justification of\nNazi-aggression, by portraying Nazi-Germany as a local hegemon willing\nto support a global territorial division based on a principle of\nnon-intervention. Schmitt hoped, for a while at least, that America\nwould reveal itself to be Germany\u2019s \u2018real enemy\u2019 and that\nit would be willing to engage in a mutual division of spheres of\ninfluence. In this vein, Schmitt interpreted the Monroe-doctrine as\nthe first act of hegemonic appropriation of a sphere of interest that\nmight come to form part of a new global order, if only America were\nwilling let Germany impose its own Monroe-doctrine on continental\nEurope (GO 83\u201390). For as long as they were militarily successful,\nSchmitt celebrated the Nazi wars as the birth pangs of a new\n\u2018nomos of the earth.\u2019 (LS section 20)\n\n\nOf course, Schmitt\u2019s hopes were disappointed when the war, after\ncatastrophic bloodshed, ended in a stalemate between two hegemonic\npowers that were both unwilling to repudiate universalist ideology,\nbut nevertheless quite successful in preventing their own conflict\nfrom escalating into open war. Schmitt, though, did not question his\nclaim that international order ought to be based on territorial\ndivision. It became fashionable in circles around Schmitt to refer to\nthe cold war as a \u2018global civil war\u2019 (M\u00fcller 2003,\n104\u201315) while Schmitt, in Theory of the Partisan,\nexpressed his admiration of Mao\u2019s and Ho Chi-minh\u2019s partisans for\nexhibiting a \u201ctelluric\u201d character and a \u201ctie to the\nsoil\u201d while rejecting \u201cworld revolutionary or technicistic\nideology.\u201d (TP 20\u20132) The new order was still supposed to\nemerge from a distribution of the globe among internally homogenous\npeoples tied to a certain land.\n\n\nIt should be obvious that Schmitt\u2019s theory of the presuppositions of\ninternational order is closely related to his account of the conditions\nof well-functioning domestic legality (Vinx 2013b). The spatialization of conflict\nrequires political communities strong enough to enforce internal\npolitical homogeneity. But political communities are unlikely to be\nable to enforce internal homogeneity if they have to live in an\ninternational environment that lacks a clear spatial order because it\nis controlled by powers that are ideologically hostile to the\nspatialization of conflict. Legitimate domestic order and legitimate\ninternational order, for Schmitt, are thus two sides of the same coin.\nBoth require a defense of the political, as Schmitt understands it.\n(Axtmann 2007) Schmitt\u2019s suggestion, however, that the preservation of\nthe political as he understands it is a necessary condition of\nlegitimate domestic and international legality seems rather hard to\nswallow in light of the catastrophic experiences of the 20th century.\nSchmitt was an acute observer and analyst of the weaknesses of liberal\nconstitutionalism and liberal cosmopolitanism. But there can be little\ndoubt that his preferred cure turned out to be infinitely worse than\nthe disease.\n",
