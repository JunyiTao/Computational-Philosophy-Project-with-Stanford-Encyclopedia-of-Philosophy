    "main_text": "Standards of Proof || Probability thresholds\n5.2 Probability thresholds\n\nLegal probabilists have proposed to interpret proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt as the requirement that the defendant\u2019s\nprobability of guilt, given the evidence presented at trial, meet a\nthreshold, say, \\(>\\).95. Variations of this view are common (see,\nfor example, Bernoulli 1713; DeKay 1996; Kaplan 1968; Kaye 1979b;\nLaplace 1814; Laudan 2006). This interpretation is, in some respects,\nplausible. From a legal standpoint, the requirement that guilt be\nestablished with high probability, still short of 1, accords with the\nprinciple that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the most stringent\nstandard of all but \u201cdoes not involve proof to an absolute\ncertainty\u201d and thus \u201cit is not proof beyond any\ndoubt\u201d (R. v. Lifchus, 1997, 3 SCR 320,\n335).\n\nReliance on probabilistic ideas is even more explicit in the standard\n\u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d\u2014also called\n\u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d\u2014which governs decisions\nin civil disputes. This standard can be interpreted as the requirement\nthat the plaintiff\u2014the party making the complaint against the\ndefendant\u2014establish its version of the facts with greater than\nprobability of .5. The .5 threshold, as opposed to a more stringent\nthreshold of .95 for criminal cases, reflects the fact that\npreponderance is less demanding than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe intermediate standard \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d\nis more stringent than the preponderance standard but not as stringent\nas the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. Since it lies in between\nthe other two, it can be interpreted as the requirement that the\nplaintiff establish its versions of the facts with, say, probability\nat the level of .75-.8.\n\nSome worry that a mechanical application of numerical thresholds would\nundermine the humanizing function of trial decision-making. As Tribe\nput it, \n\n\ninduced by the persuasive force of formulas and the precision of\ndecimal points to perceive themselves as performing a largely\nmechanical and automatic role, few jurors \u2026could be relied upon\nto recall, let alone to perform, [their] humanizing function. (1971:\n1376) \n\n\nThresholds, however, can vary depending on the costs and benefits at\nstake in each case (see later discussion). So they need not be applied\nmechanically without considering the individual circumstances (Hedden\nand Colyvan 2019). Furthermore, if jurors are numerically literate,\nthey should not lose sight of their humanizing function as they would\nno longer be intimated by numbers. So the worry suggests the need to\nensure that jurors are numerically literate, not dispensing with\nprobabilistic thresholds altogether.\n\nEven if numerical thresholds cannot be used in the daily business of\ntrial proceedings, they can still serve as theoretical concepts for\nunderstanding the role of proof standards in the justice system, such\nas regulating the relative frequency of false positive and false\nnegative decisions or minimizing expected costs. A more stringent\nthreshold will decrease the number of false positives (say false\nconvictions) at the cost of increasing the number of false negatives\n(say false acquittals), and a less stringent threshold will increase\nthe number of false positives while decreasing the number of false\nnegatives. This trade-off has been described, among others, by Justice\nHarlan in his concurring opinion in re Winship,\n397 U.S. 358, 397 (1970). As shown below, the formal apparatus\nof probability theory, in combination with expected utility theory,\ncan make this point more precise.\n",
