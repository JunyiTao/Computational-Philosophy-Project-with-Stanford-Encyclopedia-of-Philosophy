    "main_text": "Philosophical Views || Religion\n3.1 Religion\n\nIn the Platonic tradition before Porphyry, Plutarch and Plotinus\nalready interpreted classical Greek mythology as philosophical\nallegories (the Stoics were first to establish this practice).\nPorphyry, however, takes this much further than his Platonic\npredecessors and does it more systematically. This is revealed, e.g.,\nin his attitude towards Homer, whose texts he takes to have a hidden,\nphilosophical meaning behind the literal one (see The Cave of the\nNymphs). He wrote a work entitled Philosophy from\nOracles, which survives only in a few fragments (F343\u2013F350\n[Smith 1993]). We have only a vague idea about its contents but\npresumably it presented some kind of synthesis of pagan oracles and\ncults with Platonic philosophy. It is a characteristic of\npost-Iamblichean Neoplatonism (330 AD onwards) that religion,\nreligious rites and even magic (theurgy) were taken to be an\nalternative way to the soul\u2019s salvation, beside philosophy.\nPorphyry did not share this view and was scolded for his skeptical\nattitude towards theurgy by Iamblichus, his presumably former student,\nin the latter\u2019s Reply to Porphyry. Iamblichus\u2019\ncensure was actually not limited to Porphyry\u2019s attitude towards\ntheurgy, it concerned fundamental ontological issues as well (see\narticle on\n Iamblichus\n 5.3.). Porphyry did not reject magic outright, however, but he seems\nto have restricted its efficacy to the sphere of nature and not to\nhave regarded it as a means to establish contact with the intelligible\nrealm as philosophy could do (see Smith 2011b). His interpretation and\nconcerns with religious matters, however, opened for the developments\nundertaken by Iamblichus and the subsequent tradition of pagan\nNeoplatonism. Somewhat disappointingly, perhaps, the fragments from\nAgainst the Christians do not exhibit deep metaphysical\ndisagreements; they are mostly concerned with particular,\nnon-philosophical claims made in the Bible and by Christians that\nPorphyry finds incredible and objectionable.\n",
