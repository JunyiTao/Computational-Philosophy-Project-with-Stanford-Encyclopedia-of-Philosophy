    "main_text": "The Moral Weight and Force of Exploitation\n3. The Moral Weight and Force of Exploitation\n\nThe primary task of a theory of exploitation is to set forward the\ntruth conditions for the claim, \u201c\\(A\\) exploits \\(B\\)\u201d.\nBeyond this purely conceptual project, however, there remain two more\nstraightforwardly normative tasks. Adopting terminology from Alan\nWertheimer, we can describe the first of these tasks as providing an\naccount of the moral weight of exploitation, where moral\nweight refers to the intensity of exploitation\u2019s wrongness. The\nsecond task is to provide an account of the moral force of\nexploitation, where moral force is understood to refer to \u201cthe\nvarious moral upshots of reasons for action that exploitation might or\nmight not involve for parties to the transaction or for society\u201d\n(Wertheimer 1996: 28).\n\nWhen exploitation is harmful and nonconsensual, issues of both moral\nweight and force are relatively unproblematic. Whatever the added\nmoral importance of the gain to \\(A\\) from the harm to \\(B\\), it is\ncertainly at least prima facie wrong for \\(A\\) to harm \\(B\\)\nand it seems that the state is at least prima facie justified\nin prohibiting or refusing to enforce such transactions. But\nexploitation that takes place in the context of mutually advantageous\nand consensual transactions presents a more difficult set of problems.\nFirst, regarding the issue of moral weight, it might be thought that\neven if a transaction between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is unfair, there can be\nnothing seriously wrong about an agreement from which both\nparties benefit, particularly if \\(A\\) has no obligation to enter into\nany transaction with \\(B\\). At the very least, it seems difficult to\nshow how a mutually advantageous (but unfair) interaction can be\nmorally worse than no-interaction at all since, ex\nhypothesi, there is no party to the transaction for whom it is\nworse. In the recent literature on exploitation, this thought has been\nformulated more precisely as the \u201cnon-worseness\nclaim\u201d:\n\nNWC: Interaction between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) cannot be worse than\nnon-interaction when \\(A\\) has a right not to interact with \\(B\\) at\nall, and when the interaction is mutually advantageous, consensual,\nand free from negative externalities (Wertheimer 1996, 2011; Zwolinski\n2009; Powell and Zwolinski 2012).\n\nMost exploitation theorists are skeptical that the NWC is correct\n(Wertheimer 1996; Bailey 2010; Arneson 2013; Barnes 2013; Malmqvist\n2016). For if it were, then it would seem to be a mistake to blame\nindividuals who engage in certain forms of mutually beneficial\nexploitation\u2014for example, those who engage in \u201cprice\ngouging\u201d by selling electrical generators to victims of natural\ndisasters at inflated prices. (Zwolinski 2008). After all, we usually\nwould not blame those individuals if they stayed home and did nothing.\nBut, so long as people are willing to pay the high prices (and no\ncoercion or fraud is involved), both parties are better off with the\ntransaction than without it. So how could it be morally worse to\nprovide those customers with some benefit than it is to\nprovide them with no benefit at all?\n\nOf course, the NWC need not lead to a deflationary account of the\nwrongness of exploitation. It could, instead, lead to an\ninflationary account of the wrongness of non-interaction. In\nother words, we can account for the NWC\u2019s claim that mutually\nbeneficial exploitation is not worse than non-interaction\neither by saying that mutually beneficial exploitation is\nless wrong than we thought it was, or by saying that\nnon-interaction is worse than we thought it was: by saying that price\ngougers are less blameworthy than we thought, or by saying that those\nwho stay home and do nothing to help victims of disaster are\nmore blameworthy than we thought.\n\nEven if mutually beneficial exploitation really is a serious moral\nwrong, however, it might not be a kind of wrong that can justify state\nintervention (Wertheimer 1996: Ch. 9). In other words, the question of\nthe moral force of exploitation cannot be settled entirely by\nreference to its moral weight. Suppose \\(A\\) is a price gouger who\nsells bottles of water to disaster victims for $12 each. Even if \\(A\\)\nacts wrongly or fails to act virtuously, it is arguable that \\(A\\)\ndoes not harm anyone or violate anyone\u2019s rights, and only harm\nor rights violations justify state intervention. If the state cannot\nforce \\(A\\) to sell the water to \\(B\\), it might be thought completely\nirrational for the state to prohibit \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) from\nentering into a consensual and mutually advantageous transaction.\n\nMoreover, there is a real danger that preventing mutually beneficial\nbut exploitative transactions will wind up \u201cconsigning the\nvulnerable person to an even worse fate than being exploited\u201d\n(Wood 1995: 156). After all, persons who are exploited are taken\nadvantage of because of some antecedent vulnerability\u2014a lack of\naccess to clean drinking water, in the example above. Preventing\nexploitative transactions by itself does nothing to alleviate\nthis vulnerability. Indeed, by depriving vulnerable parties of one\npossibility for improving their situation by engaging in a\nmutually beneficial transaction, such interference might actually\nexacerbate it.\n\nPerhaps this view is correct. Bracketing arguments based on\nexternalities, it seems perfectly plausible to maintain that the state\nis justified in interfering with transactions only if one party is\nviolating the other\u2019s rights. That said, those who invoke the\nconcept of exploitation frequently maintain that such exploitation\nprovides a reason for state intervention. For example, when it is\nclaimed that commercial surrogacy exploits the birth mothers, the\ncritics typically argue that surrogacy contracts should be\nunenforceable or entirely prohibited. Similar things are said about\nthe sale of bodily organs. Those who make such arguments do frequently\nclaim that the transactions are nonconsensual or harmful, but they\nseem prepared to make such arguments even if the transactions are\nconsensual and mutually advantageous.\n\nOn what grounds might we justify interfering with consensual and\nmutually advantageous exploitative transactions? It might be thought\nthat we could interfere on paternalistic grounds. A paternalistic\nargument could not justify interfering with exploitative transactions\nif the exploitative transaction is advantageous to \\(B\\) and if\ninterference is not likely to result in a transaction that is more\nbeneficial to \\(B\\). For paternalism justifies interfering for\nsomeone\u2019s good, and this interference would not be to the\ntarget\u2019s benefit. But there might be situations in which \\(B\\)\nknows enough to agree only to those exploitative transactions that are\nbeneficial (as compared with no transaction), but does not know that\nless exploitative transactions are available. And so there may be a\n\u201csoft paternalist\u201d justification for interference with\nsome mutually advantageous exploitative transactions.\n\nWe might also justify interfering with exploitative transactions on\nstrategic grounds. Suppose that \\(A\\) enjoys a monopoly position, say,\nas a potential rescuer of \\(B\\). If we prohibit \\(A\\) from charging an\nexorbitant price for his services, then \\(A\\) might offer his services\nfor a reasonable price. This argument would not justify interfering in\na highly competitive market, for, under such conditions, \\(A\\) would\nnot and could not offer his services for a better price. But there may\nbe numerous situations in which such strategic arguments can work\n(Wertheimer 1996).\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that prohibiting exploitative\ntransactions is not the only way in which the state or other moral\nagents might attempt to respond to its wrongful nature. Prohibition is\nan example of what Allen Wood describes as \u201cinterference\u201d.\nBut in addition to interference, Wood suggests that we can think of\nredistribution as a way in which third parties such as the\nstate might attempt to prevent exploitation (Wood 1995: 154). After\nall, exploitation is only possible because \\(B\\) is in a position of\nvulnerability relative to \\(A\\) . One way to prevent exploitation,\nthen, is to address this vulnerability directly\u2014to channel\nresources to \\(B\\) so as to remove the hardship that makes him\nvulnerable to exploitation in the first place. If workers in the\ndeveloping world had an adequate social safety net to fall back on,\nfor instance, they would be less inclined to accept a job with the\nharsh conditions of a sweatshop, and therefore less vulnerable to\nexploitation by their employers.\n",
