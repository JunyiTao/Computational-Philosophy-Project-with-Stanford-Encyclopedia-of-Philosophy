    "main_text": "Theory of History || Sources\n3.1 Sources\n\nMarx did not set out his theory of history in great detail.\nAccordingly, it has to be constructed from a variety of texts, both\nthose where he attempts to apply a theoretical analysis to past and\nfuture historical events, and those of a more purely theoretical\nnature. Of the latter, the \u201c1859 Preface\u201d to A\nCritique of Political Economy has achieved canonical status.\nHowever, the manuscripts collected together as The German\nIdeology, co-written with Engels in 1845-46, are also a much used\nearly source. We shall briefly outline both texts, and then look at\nthe reconstruction of Marx\u2019s theory of history in the hands of\nhis philosophically most influential recent exponent, G.A. Cohen\n(Cohen 1978 [2001], 1988), who builds on the interpretation of the\nearly Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov (1856\u20131918)\n(Plekhanov 1895 [1947]).\n\nWe should, however, be aware that Cohen\u2019s interpretation is far\nfrom universally accepted. Cohen provided his reconstruction of Marx\npartly because he was frustrated with existing Hegelian-inspired\n\u201cdialectical\u201d interpretations of Marx, and what he\nconsidered to be the vagueness of the influential works of Louis\nAlthusser (1918\u20131990), neither of which, he felt, provided a\nrigorous account of Marx\u2019s views. However, some scholars believe\nthat the interpretation that we shall focus on is faulty precisely for\nits insistence on a mechanical model and its lack of attention to the\ndialectic. One aspect of this criticism is that Cohen\u2019s\nunderstanding has a surprisingly small role for the concept of class\nstruggle, which is often felt to be central to Marx\u2019s theory of\nhistory. Cohen\u2019s explanation for this is that the \u201c1859\nPreface\u201d, on which his interpretation is based, does not give a\nprominent role to class struggle, and indeed it is not explicitly\nmentioned. Yet this reasoning is problematic for it is possible that\nMarx did not want to write in a manner that would engage the concerns\nof the police censor, and, indeed, a reader aware of the context may\nbe able to detect an implicit reference to class struggle through the\ninclusion of such phrases as \u201cthen begins an era of social\nrevolution,\u201d and \u201cthe ideological forms in which men\nbecome conscious of this conflict and fight it out\u201d. Hence it\ndoes not follow that Marx himself thought that the concept of class\nstruggle was relatively unimportant. Furthermore, when A Critique\nof Political Economy was replaced by Capital, Marx made\nno attempt to keep the 1859 Preface in print, and its content\nis reproduced just as a very much abridged footnote in\nCapital. Nevertheless, we shall concentrate here on\nCohen\u2019s interpretation as no other account has been set out with\ncomparable rigour, precision and detail.\n",
