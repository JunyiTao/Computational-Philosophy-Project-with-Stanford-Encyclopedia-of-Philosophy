    "main_text": "Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence || The G\u00f6delian Argument Against \u201cStrong AI\u201d\n8.3 The G\u00f6delian Argument Against \u201cStrong AI\u201d\n\nFour decades ago, J.R. Lucas (1964) argued that G\u00f6del\u2019s\nfirst incompleteness theorem entails that no machine can ever reach\nhuman-level intelligence. His argument has not proved to be\ncompelling, but Lucas initiated a debate that has produced more\nformidable arguments. One of Lucas\u2019 indefatigable defenders is\nthe physicist Roger Penrose, whose first attempt to vindicate Lucas\nwas a G\u00f6delian attack on \u201cStrong\u201d AI articulated in\nhis The Emperor\u2019s New Mind (1989). This first attempt\nfell short, and Penrose published a more elaborate and more fastidious\nG\u00f6delian case, expressed in Chapters 2 and 3 of his Shadows of\nthe Mind (1994). \n\nIn light of the fact that readers can turn to the\n entry on the G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorems,\n a full review here is not needed. Instead, readers will be given a\ndecent sense of the argument by turning to an online paper in which\nPenrose, writing in response to critics (e.g., the philosopher David\nChalmers, the logician Solomon Feferman, and the computer scientist\nDrew McDermott) of his Shadows of the Mind, distills the\nargument to a couple of\n paragraphs.[40]\n Indeed, in this paper Penrose gives what he takes to be the perfected\nversion of the core G\u00f6delian case given in SOTM. Here is\nthis version, verbatim: \n\nWe try to suppose that the totality of methods of (unassailable)\nmathematical reasoning that are in principle humanly accessible can be\nencapsulated in some (not necessarily computational) sound formal\nsystem \\(F\\). A human mathematician, if presented with \\(F\\), could\nargue as follows (bearing in mind that the phrase \u201cI am\n\\(F\\)\u201d is merely a shorthand for \u201c\\(F\\) encapsulates all\nthe humanly accessible methods of mathematical proof\u201d):\n\n\n(A) \u201cThough I don\u2019t know that I necessarily am \\(F\\), I\nconclude that if I were, then the system \\(F\\) would have to be sound\nand, more to the point, \\(F'\\) would have to be sound, where \\(F'\\) is\n\\(F\\) supplemented by the further assertion \u201cI am \\(F\\).\u201d\nI perceive that it follows from the assumption that I am \\(F\\) that\nthe G\u00f6del statement \\(G(F')\\) would have to be true and,\nfurthermore, that it would not be a consequence of \\(F'\\). But I have\njust perceived that \u201cIf I happened to be \\(F\\), then \\(G(F')\\)\nwould have to be true,\u201d and perceptions of this nature would be\nprecisely what \\(F'\\) is supposed to achieve. Since I am therefore\ncapable of perceiving something beyond the powers of \\(F'\\), I deduce\nthat I cannot be \\(F\\) after all. Moreover, this applies to any other\n(G\u00f6delizable) system, in place of \\(F\\).\u201d (Penrose 1996,\n3.2)\n\n\n\nDoes this argument succeed? A firm answer to this question is not\nappropriate to seek in the present entry. Interested readers are\nencouraged to consult four full-scale treatments of the argument\n(LaForte et. al 1998; Bringsjord and Xiao 2000; Shapiro 2003; Bowie\n1982).\n",
