    "main_text": "The Syntactic Tradition\n1. The Syntactic Tradition\n\nIn a 1912 pioneering article in Mind \u201cImplication and\nthe Algebra of Logic\u201d C.I. Lewis started to voice his concerns\non the so-called \u201cparadoxes of material implication\u201d.\nLewis points out that in Russell and Whitehead\u2019s Principia\nMathematica we find two \u201cstartling theorems: (1) a false\nproposition implies any proposition, and (2) a true proposition is\nimplied by any proposition\u201d (1912: 522). In symbols:\n\n\\[\\tag{1}\n\\neg p \\rightarrow(p \\rightarrow q)\n\\]\n\n\nand \n\n\\[\\tag{2}\np \\rightarrow(q \\rightarrow p)\n\\]\n\n\nLewis has no objection to these theorems in and of themselves: \n\n\nIn themselves, they are neither mysterious sayings, nor great\ndiscoveries, nor gross absurdities. They exhibit only, in sharp\noutline, the meaning of \u201cimplies\u201d which has been\nincorporated into the algebra. (1912: 522) \n\n\nHowever, the theorems are inadequate vis-\u00e0-vis the\nintended meaning of \u201cimplication\u201d and our actual modes of\ninference that the intended meaning tries to capture. So Lewis has in\nmind an intended meaning for the conditional connective\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) or \\(\\supset\\), and that is the meaning of the English\nword \u201cimplies\u201d. The meaning of \u201cimplies\u201d is\nthat \u201cof ordinary inference and proof\u201d (1912: 531)\naccording to which a proposition implies another proposition if the\nsecond can be logically deduced from the first. Given such an\ninterpretation, (1) and (2) ought not to be theorems, thus\npropositional logic may be regarded as unsound\nvis-\u00e0-vis the reading of \\(\\rightarrow\\) as logical\nimplication. Consider (2) for example: from the sheer truth of a\nproposition \\(p\\) it does not (logically) follow that \\(p\\) follows\nlogically from any proposition whatsoever. Additionally, given the\nintended, strict reading of \\(\\rightarrow\\) as logical implication and\nthe equivalence of \\((\\neg p\\rightarrow q)\\) and \\((p\\vee q)\\), Lewis\ninfers that disjunction too must be given a new intensional sense,\naccording to which \\((p\\vee q)\\) holds just in case if \\(p\\) were not\nthe case it would have to be the case that \\(q\\).\n\nConsiderations of this sort, based on the distinction between\nextensional and intensional readings of the connectives, were not\noriginal to Lewis. Already in 1880 Hugh MacColl in the first of a\nseries of eight papers on Symbolical Reasoning published in\nMind claimed that \\((p\\rightarrow q)\\) and \\((\\neg p\\vee q)\\)\nare not equivalent: \\((\\neg p\\vee q)\\) follows from \\((p\\rightarrow\nq)\\), but not vice versa (MacColl 1880: 54). This is the case because\nMacColl interprets \\(\\vee\\) as regular extensional disjunction, and\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) as intensional implication, but then from the falsity\nof \\(p\\) or the truth of \\(q\\) it does not follow that \\(p\\) without\n\\(q\\) is logically impossible. In the second paper of the series,\nMacColl distinguishes between certainties, possibilities and variable\nstatements, and introduces Greek letters as indices to classify\npropositions. So \\(\\alpha^{\\varepsilon}\\) expresses that \\(\\alpha\\) is\na certainty, \\(\\alpha^{\\eta}\\) that \\(\\alpha\\) is an impossibility,\nand \\(\\alpha^{\\theta}\\) that \\(\\alpha\\) is a variable, i.e., neither a\ncertainty nor an impossibility (MacColl 1897: 496\u20137). Using this\nthreefold classification of statements, MacColl proceeds to\ndistinguish between causal and general implication. A causal\nimplication holds between statements \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) if\nwhenever \\(\\alpha\\) is true \\(\\beta\\) is true, and \\(\\beta\\) is not a\ncertainty. A general implication holds between \\(\\alpha\\) and\n\\(\\beta\\) whenever \\(\\alpha\\) and not\\(-\\beta\\) is impossible, thus in\nparticular whenever \\(\\alpha\\) is an impossibility or \\(\\beta\\) a\ncertainty (1897: 498). The use of indices opened the door to the\niteration of modalities, and the beginning of the third paper of the\nseries (MacColl 1900: 75\u20136) is devoted to clarifying the meaning\nof statements with iterated indices, including \\(\\tau\\) for truth and\n\\(\\iota\\) for negation. So for example \\(A^{\\eta \\iota \\varepsilon}\\)\nis read as \u201cIt is certain that it is false that A is\nimpossible\u201d (note that the indices are read from right to left).\nInterestingly, Bertrand Russell\u2019s 1906 review of MacColl\u2019s\nbook Symbolic Logic and its Applications (1906) reveals that\nRussell did not understand the modal idea of the variability of a\nproposition, hence wrongly attributed to MacColl a confusion between\nsentences and propositions, as Russell conferred variability only to\nsentences whose meaning, hence truth value, was not\nfixed. Similarly, certainty and impossibility are for Russell material\nproperties of propositional functions (true of everything or of\nnothing) and not modal properties of propositions. It might be said\nthat MacColl\u2019s work came too early and fell on deaf ears. In\nfact, Rescher reports on Russell\u2019s declared difficulty in\nunderstanding MacColl\u2019s symbolism and, more importantly, argues\nthat Russell\u2019s view of logic had a negative impact on the\ndevelopment of modal logic (\u201cBertrand Russell and Modal\nLogic\u201d in Rescher 1974: 85\u201396). Despite MacColl\u2019s\nearlier work, Lewis can be regarded as the father of the syntactic\ntradition, not only because of his greater influence on later\nlogicians, but especially for his development of various systems\ncontaining the new intensional connectives.\n",
