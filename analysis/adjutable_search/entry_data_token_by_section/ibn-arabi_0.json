    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee referred to himself with fuller versions of his\nname, such as Ab\u00fb \u2018Abdall\u00e2h Muhammad ibn\n\u2018Al\u00ee ibn al-\u2018Arab\u00ee al-T\u00e2\u2019\u00ee\nal-H\u00e2tim\u00ee (the last three names indicating his noble Arab\nlineage). He was born in Murcia in 1165 to the family of a minor\nofficial and received the standard education of a literatus, without\nany special attention to religious topics. In his early teens he\nunderwent a visionary conversion \u201cat the hands of Jesus\u201d\n(albeit the Jesus of the Koran), and this resulted in an\n\u201copening\u201d (fut\u00fbh) of his soul toward the\ndivine realm. Shortly thereafter, in about 1180, his father took him\nto meet his friend Averroes. Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee recounts an\nelliptical conversation in which he explained to the philosopher the\nlimits of rational perception. Corbin has taken this event as a\nsymbolic parting of ways between Islam and the West: with the help of\nLatin Averroism, Western thinkers were soon to pursue an exclusively\nrationalistic path leading \u201cto the conflict between theology and\nphilosophy, between faith and knowledge, between symbol and\nhistory\u201d (Corbin 1969, 13). In contrast, Muslim intellectuals\ntended rather to ignore Averroes, though Avicenna, Suhraward\u00ee,\nand other philosophers continued to be read, annotated, and improved\nupon. At the same time, no one could fail to notice Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s challenge to merely rational understanding,\nand many Muslim philosophers followed paths that undertook the\nharmonization of reason, mystical intuition, and revelation.\n\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee studied the Islamic sciences with numerous\nteachers in Andalus and North Africa. In 1201 he left the Muslim West\nto perform the pilgrimage to Mecca and did not return. He traveled\nextensively in Iraq and Anatolia, finally settling down in Damascus in\n1223, where he trained disciples and wrote prolifically until his\ndeath in November 1240.\n\nAmong his several hundred books and treatises, Ringstones\nand Openings are the most famous. Ringstones became\nthe standard text to transmit his teachings and, during the next six\ncenturies, was the object of more than a hundred commentaries. Among\nhis many talented disciples, the most influential was his stepson Sadr\nal-D\u00een Q\u00fbnaw\u00ee (1210\u201374), who began the process\nof systematizing his teachings and elucidating his perspective in\nconversation with contemporary philosophy, even initiating a\ncorrespondence with Nas\u00eer al-D\u00een al-T\u00fbs\u00ee, the\nimportant reviver of Avicenna (Q\u00fbnaw\u00ee,\nal-Mur\u00e2sal\u00e2t).\n",
