    "main_text": "Epistemology and Metaphysics || Early Views\n3.1 Early Views\n\nReichenbach began his philosophical career as a neo-Kantian, a\nperspective that is evident in his thesis and in his first book-length\neffort (1920f) after his doctoral thesis, and that at least echoes in\nhis later work. The aim of The Theory of Relativity and A Priori\nKnowledge is to reconcile Kantian theory in a limited way with\nthe theory of relativity by distinguishing two senses of synthetic a\npriori: Principles governing the content of experience can be\nsynthetic a priori because they are necessary, transcendental truths,\nor because they are non-empirical principles that form part of how we\nconstruct our representation of reality, and are thus revisable.\nReichenbach endorses the latter constitutive sense of the synthetic a\npriori, and sees his task as scrutinizing Kant\u2019s principles in\nlight of the \u201cnew\u201d reality described in the theory of\nrelativity. Reichenbach\u2019s\u2014never clearly\nspecified\u2014process of a construction of a representation is\nhidden behind the idea of \u201ccoordination\u201d. Particular\nprinciples, such as those of causality or probability, are supposed to\nestablish a correspondence between something in experience\nand our representation of it in the form of a mathematically\naxiomatized scientific theory (\u00e0 la Hilbert). What that\nsomething is, Reichenbach never clearly describes. He\nexplicitly rejects the proposal that it is just sensation, and he\nadmits that what he is describing is a curious case of \u201cthe\ncoordination of two sets, of which one [...set\u2019s] elements are\nfirst defined through the coordination\u201d (p. 40, 1965a). While a\npriori in the constitutive sense, the coordination principles are\ncontingent, they could be changed if experience makes others more\nconvenient. The picture is very much like that C.I. Lewis offers at\nabout the same time in Mind and the World Order (1929). \n\nReichenbach\u2019s account of the ascension from sense data to\nindividual things to scientific theories is via an account of testing,\nin spirit close to ideas that Hermann Weyl (1927) and Rudolf Carnap\n(1936) were later to advance, in which various hypotheses support one\nanother, each functioning as an auxiliary in tests of others, an idea\nGlymour (1980) later unsuccessfully tried to formalize as\n\u201cbootstrapping.\u201d The foundational character of sense data\nand the view that objects and their properties and relations are\nconstructions endures for some years in Reichenbach\u2019s thought,\nfor example in his 1929 essay on \u201cThe Aims and Methods of\nPhysical Knowledge\u201d (1929g), where, however, the example and\nauthority is no longer Kant\u2019s first Critique but rather\nRussell\u2019s Our Knowledge of the External World (1914)\nand Carnap\u2019s The Logical Structure of the World (1928).\n\n\nBy the late 1920s Reichenbach was moving away from neo-Kantian\npositions and towards logical positivist views, allying himself with\nthe Vienna Circle philosophers, although he always maintained and\nemphasized in retrospect that the \u201cempiricist philosophy\u201d\nhe pursued in the Berlin Group was much more focused and engaged with\nscience and did not fall prey to the positivist problems that came out\nof attempts to ground knowledge on sense data alone. He did not view\nhis contemporaries uniformly. For Moritz Schlick, Reichenbach seems to\nhave had a somewhat condescending respect, for Ludwig Wittgenstein,\nwho is one of the few philosophers whom he later criticizes by name in\nExperience and Prediction (1938c), and for Karl Popper, none\nwhatsoever. Aside from Einstein, his deepest respect and closest\nintellectual alliances seem to have been with Kurt Lewin, Kurt\nGrelling, Rudolf Carnap, Richard von Mises (although they do not seem\nto have got along personally) and Bertrand Russell, although\nReichenbach was not pleased with Russell\u2019s criticism of his\nviews in Russell\u2019s last philosophical book, Human Knowledge,\nIts Scope and Limits (Russell, 1948; see Reichenbach 1978, vol.\nII, p. 405). \n\nFurther Reading. Chapter 2 of Ryckman (2005) provides a very\nclear attempt at reconstructing Reichenbach\u2019s struggle with\nKantian principles in the 1920s. Padovani (2008) provides a wealth of\ntextual detail and references for the same period, with a more focused\nnotion of Reichenbach\u2019s notion of \u201ccoordination\u201d in\nPadovani (2011, 2015, 2017). Chapter 6 of Milmed (1961) traces the\nKantian elements in Reichenbach\u2019s epistemology and discusses the\nconflicts that arise, though the analysis concerns primarily\nReichenbach\u2019s mature views.\n",
