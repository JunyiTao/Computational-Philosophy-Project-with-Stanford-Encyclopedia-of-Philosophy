    "main_text": "Strength of Evidence\n3. Strength of Evidence\n\nThe decision whether to allow a party to adduce a particular item of\nevidence is one that the judge has to make and arises in the course of\na trial.\n Section 2\n above dealt with the conditions that must be satisfied for a\nwitness\u2019s testimony, a document or an object to be received as\nevidence. At the end of the trial, the fact-finder must consider all\nthe evidence that has been presented and reach a verdict. Although\nverdict deliberation is sometimes subjected to various forms of\ncontrol through legal devices such as presumptions and corroboration\nrules, such control is limited and the fact-finder is expected to\nexercise personal judgment in the evaluation of evidence\n(Dama\u0161ka 2019). Having heard or seen the evidence, the\nfact-finder now has to evaluate or \u2018weigh\u2019 it in reaching\nthe verdict. Weight can refer to any of the following three properties\nof evidence: (a) the probative value of individual items of evidence,\n(b) the sufficiency of the whole body of evidence adduced at the trial\nin meeting the standard of proof, or (c) the relative completeness of\nthis body of evidence. The first two aspects of weight are familiar to\nlegal practitioners but the third has been confined to academic\ndiscussions. These three ideas are discussed in the same order\nbelow.\n",
