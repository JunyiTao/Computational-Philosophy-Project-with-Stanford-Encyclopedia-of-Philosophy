    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nBorn in Mantua, Pomponazzi studied at Padua, obtaining his degree in\narts in 1487. He then taught there, first as extraordinary and then\nordinary professor from 1488\u20131496 (Nardi 1965: 54\u201355). His\nteacher and fellow professor at Padua Nicoletto Vernia as well as his\ncolleague Alessandro Achillini openly endorsed Averroes\u2019 view of\nthe unicity of the material intellect, a view that Bishop Pietro\nBarrozzi condemned with the threat of excommunication in 1489, leading\nthem to revise or hide their teachings (Hasse 2016: 184\u2013214).\nPomponazzi questioned and ultimately rejected Averroes\u2019 unicity\nposition. Perhaps influenced by his other teachers Pietro Trapolino\nand Francesco Securo da Nard\u00f2, he respected Thomas\nAquinas\u2019s views even if he found them to use theological\npremises that he believed were unwelcome in natural philosophy\nand contrary to Aristotle\u2019s philosophy. Despite rejecting\nAverroes\u2019 view on the material intellect, throughout his career,\nPomponazzi\u2019s lectures relied on Averroes\u2019 commentaries.\nFor example, among Pomponazzi\u2019s writings are\nquaestiones based on Averroes\u2019 De substantia\norbis (On the Substance of the Orbs). Around 1496, he\nobtained a doctorate in medicine (Oliva 1926: 179), a common step for\nthose who wished to rise in the universities of northern Italy, where\nphilosophy was often taught as preparation to the study of medicine\n(see Kristeller 1993: vol. 3, 436\u201338; Kraye 2010: 93). Although\nPomponazzi never taught medicine he was consulted for his medical\nexpertise (see Park 2006: 175\u201376) and frequently considered\nmedical teachings in his writings on wondrous phenomena,\nAristotle\u2019s zoological writings, and Meteorologica IV\n(see Perfetti 2004: xliii\u2013xlv; Martin 2002). During this first\nstint at Padua, he wrote Quaestio de maximo et minimo\n(Question on the Maximum and the Minimum), which\nattacked William Heytesbury and the calculatory tradition (see\nBiard 2009). Beginning in the 1330s, Heytesbury and others at Merton\nCollege at Oxford applied mathematical and logical analysis on a range\nof topics, including natural philosophical questions regarding\nkinematics. Pomponazzi remained hostile to the calculatory and\nterminist traditions throughout his life because he considered their\ninterpretations of Aristotle\u2019s texts as veering too far from a\nstrict exegesis of Aristotle. In 1496, Pomponazzi left Padua, after\ndisputing with Agostino Nifo, and tutored Prince Alberto Pio da Carpi,\nwho was in exile at Ferrara. Alberto Pio remained for years a\nsupporter of Aristotelian thought, commissioning translations of\nAverroes and Aristotle, and Pomponazzi dedicated his 1514 De\nintensione et remissione formarum (On the Intension and\nRemission of Forms) to him (see Schmitt 1984).\n\nAfter returning to Padua in 1499, he taught natural philosophy there\nuntil 1509, when the university closed due to the War of the League of\nCambrai. He stayed briefly in Ferrara, where he taught at\nthe university for a year, and then returned to his native\nMantua, before moving to the university of Bologna in\n1511. He remained there for the rest of his life, teaching\nnatural and moral philosophy (Oliva 1926: 265). His years at Bologna\nwere both productive and filled with controversy, including being\nunsuccessfully accused of heresy in 1514 and in 1518 (Nardi 1965: 70;\nBianchi 2008: 132). All his works printed during the sixteenth century\nstem from his tenure at Bologna (Lohr 1988: 347\u201362). In\n1514 he completed a disputation on the intension and remission of\nforms; and in 1515 he published the question De reactione\n(On Reaction). A year later he published Tractatus de\nimmortalitate animae (Treatise on the Immortality of the\nSoul). The work defends a materialist reading of Aristotle in\nwhich the human soul depends on and perishes with the body. The\ntreatise came out three years after the Fifth Lateran Council issued\nthe bull Apostolici regiminis. The bull demanded that\nphilosophers refrain from teaching that the soul is one in number or\nmortal and that the universe eternal. It also demanded that\nphilosophers defend Christian doctrine to the best of their ability.\nAs Pomponazzi\u2019s teaching appeared to many to run against the\nbull, he was attacked, but also defended, by a number of scholars and\necclesiastical authorities. Although he was denounced as a heretic, he\nwas not tried and never abjured, protected by the powerful\nVenetian Cardinal Pietro Bembo (see Bianchi 2008: 130\u201334; Pine 1986:\n124\u201328).\n\nDespite these controversies, Pomponazzi maintained his position at\nBologna and continued to teach and write, pursuing many of the themes\nfound in his psychological writings. In 1520, he completed De\nnaturalium effectuum admirandorum causis sive de incantationibus\n(On the Causes of Marvelous Natural Effects or On\nIncantations). The work circulated in manuscript widely before\nbeing printed first in 1556 and again in 1567 (Regnicoli 2010). In the\nsame year he finished De fato, de libero arbitrio, de\npraedestinatione (On Fate, Free Will, On\nPredestination), which was not printed until 1567. In 1521, he\npublished De nutritione et augmentatione (On Nutrition\nand Growth). Given greater freedom to choose the subject of his\nlectures as the result of contract negotiations, Pomponazzi lectured\non a number of Aristotle\u2019s writings that were not part of the\ntypical duties of an ordinary professor. These topics include\nAristotle\u2019s De generatione et corruptione and his\nzoological and meteorological writings. His Dubitationes in\nquartum Meteorologicorum librum (Doubts on Meteorologica\nIV) were printed in 1563. Pomponazzi, after several years of illness,\ndied from kidney disease in 1525 (Nardi 1965: 205\u20136).\n2. Writings, Methods, and Interpretative Challenges\n\nThere are numerous challenges to interpreting the writings of\nPomponazzi. In addition to his writings printed during the sixteenth\ncentury, many reportationes (transcripts) made by listeners\nof his lectures are extant. Due to the nature of their creation, they\npotentially contain errors or are incomplete. At times, they appear to\npresent conflicting views. Filled with witticisms and ironic\nstatements, they reveal insights into Pomponazzi\u2019s popularity as\na lecturer. Adding to the difficulty of interpretation, are\nPomponazzi\u2019s repeated statements of not having solutions to\nphilosophical questions and his promotion of the idea that\nphilosophy teaches the practice of doubting (Perfetti 1999).\nAccordingly, he questioned at times both ecclesiastical authority and\nthe prevailing philosophical environment of Padua and Bologna that was\ncharacterized by Averroism (Hasse 2016: 196).\n\nAn additional impediment in interpreting Pomponazzi stems from his\narguments that he characterized as in naturalibus (based\non nature). Similarly, he at times described himself as following the\nvia peripatetica (the Peripatetic path), which meant\ninvestigating according to Aristotelian principles without influence\nfrom other fields, most prominently theology. Restricting arguments to\nthose that are in naturalibus or following the via\nperipatetica required determining Aristotle\u2019s\nview, regardless of its truth. Pomponazzi justified this approach on\nthe grounds that natural philosophy possesses different principles\nthan theology and therefore those fields should not use the principles\nof other fields. Consequently, at times he maintained that as a lay\nperson he was unable to pronounce on theological questions.\nFurthermore, his duties as professor of philosophy, as in essence a\nprofessional Aristotelian, required him to expound the views of\nAristotle, regardless of their conformity to theological truth.\nThus, he included provisos in On the Immortality of the\nSoul, On Incantations,\nand Apology that stated that his conclusions were\nmerely according to philosophy and that he accepted the determinations\nof the Catholic Church as having a greater degree of authority than\nphilosophy. Some of his contemporaries and later scholars have seen\nthe inclusion of these provisos as being disingenuous, a means to\nprotect himself from prosecution (Renan 1852: 286; Pine 1986: 123).\nBut other scholars have argued for the philosophical coherence of\nhis employment of probable arguments and deference to faith (see\nPerrone Compagni 1999: lxxxv\u2013xcvi). In the thirteenth\ncentury Albertus Magnus had distinguished between investigations\nof nature and the divine, contending that the fields have distinct\nmethods and that revelation disagrees at times with arguments based on\nreason and experience (Martin 2014: 16\u201318). Although at times\nAlbertus\u2019s position was controversial, a number of medieval\nphilosophers endorsed his view. Thus even if Pomponazzi included these\nprovisos as a protective measure, he nevertheless simultaneously\nendorsed a long medieval tradition that held that natural philosophy\nwas separate from theology and that theological truths prevailed over\nphilosophical ones (Bianchi 2008).\n\nPomponazzi used the methods and language typical of the medieval\nscholastic tradition (Kraye 2010), primarily relying on reason and\nexperience as the key tools for investigation. The former refers to\nthe logical and philosophical principles of Aristotelianism, the\nlatter refers to both quotidian experience and the experiences found\nin the writings of authorities, witnessed in testimonies of\ncontemporaries, and taken from his own personal history. He had a\ncritical attitude toward some humanist writers, for example, judging\nGiovanni Pico della Mirandola\u2019s attack on astrology to be\nignorant of the workings of the field. And while his Latin prose did\nnot match the polished elegance of Renaissance humanists, in\nother ways his writings, through their extensive consideration of\nancient philosophical and literary sources,\nreflect developments of humanism. Despite never learning\nGreek as many of his fellow philosophers did, including his rival\nAgostino Nifo, Pomponazzi relied on new translations of Greek\ncommentators on Aristotle, most significantly those of Alexander of\nAphrodisias (Kessler 2011). Furthermore, his later writings,\nespecially On Incantations, take evidence from a broad range\nof Greek, Roman, and Renaissance poets and historians, interspersed\namong citations of the typical authorities of the scholastic\ntraditions. In that work, he also discussed the possible natural\ncauses of the Delphic oracle (see Ossa-Richardson 2010).\n3. Psychology\n\nPomponazzi\u2019s most complete discussion of the human soul was\npublished in his 1516 On the Immortality of the Soul. The\nwork builds on earlier discussions found in quaestiones\ndelivered in 1503 and 1504 (Pomponazzi 2018; Poppi 1970: 27\u201392;\nKristeller 1944) and in lectures on De anima given in\n1514\u201315 (Bakker 2007). In On the Immortality of the\nSoul, he sought to establish whether the human intellect is\nseparable and immortal using a methodology that did not exceed\n\u201cnatural limits\u201d, that is, without supposing\n\u201csomething from faith or revelation\u201d and to determine what\nis \u201cin conformity with the words of Aristotle\u201d (ch. 8). He\ncautioned that he did not affirm anything contrary to Thomas\nAquinas\u2019s views but his critiques advance \u201cin the way of\ndoubt and not of assertion\u201d (ch. 8). Moreover, he tempered his\nconsiderations by declaring his preference for scripture over\n\u201chuman reasoning and experience\u201d (ch. 8).\n\nIn what manner the human intellect is separable was a frequently\ndebated question in Renaissance discussions of the soul. Many of\nPomponazzi\u2019s contemporaries adopted Averroes\u2019 solution\nthat the possible or material intellect must be one in number and thus\nshared by all humans. Pomponazzi rejected Averroes\u2019 view,\ndeeming it \u201cmost false, unintelligible, monstrous, and quite\nforeign to Aristotle\u201d (ch. 4). After rejecting Averroes\u2019\nunicity thesis, Pomponazzi maintained that the most probable arguments\naccording to natural philosophy and Aristotle\u2019s view are\ncontrary to Thomas\u2019s position that the individual human\nintellect is immortal, separable, and unqualifiedly immaterial.\n\nA central premise for Pomponazzi\u2019s psychology is that the entire\nhuman soul falls under the study of natural philosophy. The human soul\nhas three powers\u2014vegetative, sensitive, rational\u2014but is\nunified; these powers do not have distinct substantial forms (see\nCasini 2007). Pomponazzi generally referred not to the intellect but\nrather to the intellective soul, meaning the rational power of the\nhuman soul (Sellars 2016). This intellective soul, or rational soul,\nrests midway between the eternal and perishable (ch. 1; see Bakker\n2007: 165\u201367). Accordingly, he emphasized the relation between\nthe intellectual soul and the sensitive soul, citing Aristotle\u2019s\nstatement that \u201cthe soul does not know at all without some\nphantasm (phantasma)\u201d (De anima 3.7\n431a16\u201317). The intellectual soul\u2019s dependence on these\nphantasms\u2014images that the imagination creates based on what has\nbeen sensed\u2014is confirmed for Pomponazzi not just by\nAristotle\u2019s authority but also by our own experience and by\nexperiences with those who have suffered injuries to the relevant\norgans. Since the sensitive soul resides within a material organ and\nsensation occurs in time, it is dependent on matter both with respect\nto subject (i.e., the sense organ) and object (i.e., the sensible).\nThe human intellectual or rational soul, however, is dependent on\nmatter for its object (i.e., the phantasms) but is only immaterial\nwith respect to its subject (i.e., cognition) (see Brenet 2009).\n\nBecause the human intellectual soul depends on the operations of the\nsensitive soul, which are part of a material and perishable body, it\ncannot function after the body has been destroyed. Accordingly, in\nPomponazzi\u2019s view, the human intellectual soul is immortal only\nin a relative or qualified sense. Because the act of understanding\ndoes not require a material organ as subject, the human intellectual\nsoul is more immortal than the sensitive soul or the souls of animals.\nThe human soul partakes in the immortal through its limited knowledge\nof the forms of species, without being immortal in itself. Yet because\nit cannot function without the sensitive soul, it is lower than\nGod\u2019s intelligence and than the intelligences that move the\ncelestial spheres, which are separated substances. Moreover, the human\nsoul differs from these separated intelligences in that it is the\nactualization of a body while the intelligences merely actuate, that\nis, set in motion, the celestial spheres without receiving anything\nfrom the matter of the orb. The human\u2019s soul dependency on\nmatter means that human cognition is less abstracted than that of the\nintelligences, which know through intuition not sensation.\nAccordingly, the human soul cannot know universals unqualifiedly but\nonly in relation to singulars. Thereby, the human rational soul, with\nits functioning tied to material objects, sits midway between the\nmaterial and the immaterial and between the eternal and the\nperishable; and human knowledge, while partaking in the knowledge of\nuniversals, possesses it in limited manner (ch. 8).\n\nWhile most scholarship has emphasized Pomponazzi\u2019s argument\nrelated to the connection between the intellectual and sensitive soul,\nhe put forth several other arguments based on Aristotelian principles\nagainst the immortality of individual human souls. He argued that if\nthe human soul survives the death of the body at that point it must be\nan individual indivisible substance that is either in some place or\nnowhere. If it is somewhere, it must have arrived there through\nlocomotion, yet Aristotle denies that indivisibles can move in space.\nIf it is nowhere, then Aristotle could have posited intelligences that\ndo not move the spheres and potentially there could exist an infinite\nnumber of intelligences, which in turn is prohibited by\nAristotle\u2019s arguments against the realization of an infinite\nmultitude. Similarly, he argued that if human souls are immortal and\nindividual, given that the world and its species are eternal according\nto Aristotle, the number of human souls must be infinite or souls must\ntransmigrate, both propositions that Aristotle rejected. Additionally,\nPomponazzi dismissed Thomas Aquinas\u2019s view that God creates each\nhuman soul placed within the body as being an explanation unacceptable\nto natural philosophy because Aristotle held that according to natural\nphilosophy the soul is not created but rather generated \u201cby the\nsun and man\u201d (Physics 2.2. 194b13) and everything that\nis generated perishes (ch. 8).\n\nGiven the importance of the immortality of the soul to Catholic\ndoctrine, Pomponazzi considered the ramifications of the soul\u2019s\nmortality to ethics and the possibility of human happiness and\nblessedness (see Cuttini 2012). He countered the argument that\nimmortality of the soul is necessary for a happy end achieved by\nperfecting the intellect by contending that achieving such\nintellectual perfection is only possible for someone with superior\nintellectual ability and of sound health, who has withdrawn from\nworldly affairs. Yet, such individuals are extremely\nrare\u2014\u201ceven in long centuries, barely one is\nfound\u201d\u2014and the human race and its societies do not permit\nall humans to devote themselves to philosophy (ch. 13). To the\npotential objection that belief in the mortality of the soul\nencourages immoral acts since some persons would choose to commit\ncrimes because there would be no punishment or rewards after death,\nPomponazzi responded that there are sufficient motivations for\nvirtue without considerations of the afterlife. In his view, the\nessential reward of virtue is virtue itself, which is\nhumankind\u2019s greatest good and brings security and peace of mind.\nAccordingly, the religious teachings of immortality are not true\naccording to the principles of natural philosophy but were introduced\nin order to persuade those incapable of understanding philosophy to\nbehave in a moral fashion, thereby allowing society to function (ch.\n14).\n\nKeeping with his earlier statements that his arguments were probable\nand according to natural principles, Pomponazzi concluded that the\nquestion of the immortality of the soul is a neutral problem, meaning\nthat there are no arguments based only on nature that prove either\nimmortality or mortality. His application of the term \u201cneutral\nproblem\u201d was not novel. John Duns Scotus had come to the same\nconclusion about the immortality of the soul, and Thomas Aquinas\nregarded the question of the eternity of the world as a neutral\nproblem. Consequently, faith is the ultimate arbiter of the question,\nand Pomponazzi maintained that Christians must follow the doctrine of\nimmortality that has been established by the Church fathers and Pope\nGregory I, who were the greatest experts in divine matters (ch.\n15).\n\nOn the Immortality of the Soul provoked numerous polemics, in\nwhich Pomponazzi defended his views. In 1518, he published\nApologia (Apology). The first book\nof Apology responds to the objections made by his former\nstudent Gaspare Contarini, and the second book answers critiques made\nby other philosophers and theologians. These books address questions\nabout free-will and wondrous phenomena, which were later discussed in\ngreater depth in On Incantations. The third and final book\nrecounts Pomponazzi\u2019s reactions to Ambrogio Flandino\u2019s\nhostile preaching and to public uproar in Venice. Pomponazzi asserted\nhis innocence from these charges, while proclaiming his belief in the\nimmortality of the soul, emphasizing that his book only concluded that\nAristotle held the soul to be mortal (3.1.3). He argued that\ntheologians from Augustine to Duns Scotus maintained that the soul is\nmortal according to Aristotle and therefore sustaining such a position\nshould not be considered heretical (3.3.4).  In fact, Tommaso de Vio\n(Gaetano), a former general of the Domincan order, who at the time was\na cardinal and close to Leo X, had recently cast doubt over whether\nthe immortality of the soul is demonstrable according to Aristotle\n(Gilson 1963: 173\u201383). Furthermore, Pomponazzi maintained that\nhe could not be considered a heretic because the definition of heresy\nentails adhering firmly to one\u2019s own opinion, but he had never\nreceived warnings from ecclesiastical authorities and therefore could\nnot have adhered firmly to anything contrary to the Catholic\nChurch\u2019s teachings (3.3.1\u20132). In 1519, Pomponazzi\npublished Defensorium (Defense) in reply to Agostino\nNifo\u2019s lengthy attack that argued that intellection is possible\nwithout phantasms (de Boer 2018: 19\u201325). The Defense\nwas printed together with Giovanni Crisostomo Javelli\u2019s response\nthat offered theological and Platonic counterpoints to\nPomponazzi\u2019s views. The theologians Ambrogio Flandino and\nBartolomeo Spina also published attacks on Pomponazzi\u2019s\ntreatment of the soul (see Blum 2007: 223\u201327).\n4. Wondrous Nature, the Preternatural, and Miracles\n\nIn 1520, Pomponazzi finished On Incantations, a work that\nexpanded many themes of his psychological writings. The book\nundermines the use of demonic and supernatural explanations for\nsublunary phenomena. The work is presented as a response to the\nquestion: How would Aristotelians explain what \u201cseems to be\nbeyond the order of nature\u201d (praeter naturae\nordinem) or, in other words, what seems preternatural? The\ncategory of preternatual, which included diseases and\nstrange, seemingly irregular phenomena, formed the subject matter\nof numerous early modern philosophical inquiries (see Daston 2000).\nWith respect to On Incantations, Pomponazzi\u2019s friend,\nLudovico Panizza, asked him to explain the extraordinary recoveries of\nthree boys from a skin disease, burns, and a sword that physicians\ncould not remove (Praefatio.1). The actions of demons\ncould explain these recoveries; Pomponazzi stated that these\ndemonic acts are justified in accordance with ecclesiastical law\n(ex decreto Ecclesiae) and are capable of \u201csaving many\nexperiences\u201d. Yet, Pomponazzi contended that Aristotelians\nshould not use demons to explain these wondrous events. In\nPomponazzi\u2019s view even if demons exist, a premise that Aristotle\ndid not admit according to Pomponazzi\u2019s interpretation of\nMetaphysics Lambda, they would not be able to affect the\nsublunary world because they would not have adequate knowledge of its\nparticulars. Demons\u2019 knowledge of sublunary particulars must\nderive either through essences or from sensation and\nphantasmata (i.e., mental images). Knowledge through\nessences, however, does not provide knowledge of singulars but only\nuniversals and species. Moreover, knowledge from sensation and\nphantasmata entails generation, corruption, and corporeality,\nproperties which cannot belong to demons (1.1).\n\nDemons\u2019 lack of knowledge of natural particulars is merely one\nreason they cannot be the cause of wondrous sublunary events. Citing\nAugustine, Pomponazzi contended that all theologians hold that while\ndemons can directly move bodies from one place to another they cannot\nalter them directly but must do so through natural bodies. Yet,\nPomponazzi rejected the likelihood that demons affect change by\napplying active powers to passives, just like humans imperfectly do\nwhen they apply medicines. For Pomponazzi, this understanding of\ndemonic action is untenable because it requires that demons use\nsensible material substances, which would be detectable. Presumably\ndemons must carry these substances in pillboxes and bags, all of which\nis contrary to experience (1.2). Finally, he concluded that it is\nsuperfluous to suppose demonic influence \u201cbecause we can save\nthese kinds of experiences through natural causes\u201d (1.3).\nAccordingly, the first half of On Incantations posits\nhypothetical natural causes of preternatural experiences in an attempt\nto show the inadequacy and superfluity of demonic explanation.\nPomponazzi presented his conclusions as part of a process that leads\ncloser to the truth, arguing that \u201csciences develop through steps\u201d\n(scientiae enim fiunt per additamenta) (9.1). He likened\nthis process to changes in legal codes, whereby better laws replace\nolder inferior ones, admitting that his solutions should be\naccepted only while there are no\npreferable alternatives (Peroratio.1).\n\nEmploying doctrines key to natural magic, Pomponazzi put forth three\npotential ways that natural causes could explain wondrous effects:\ndirectly through manifest causes, such as heat and cold; through\noccult qualities or powers; or indirectly through vapors and spirits\nthat had been altered by such powers (3.1\u20133; Copenhaver 2015:\n272\u201384). In support of these explanations, citing Albertus\nMagnus, Marsilio Ficino, Pliny, and unnamed botanists, he maintained\nthat herbs, stones, minerals, and animal extracts possess nearly\ncountless occult powers and that if we knew them it would be possible\nto reduce those effects that the unlearned attribute to demons and\nangels to the actions of these occult powers. In support of the\nexistence of these occult powers Pomponazzi described experiences with\nherbal medicines, magnets, electric rays (torpedines), and\nremoras\u2014fish that allegedly could halt ships with the power of\ntheir mouths\u2014experiences, all verified as true by respected\nauthorities (3.2\u20133).\n\nPomponazzi contended that similar powers reside in humans, either\nthrough the temperament, the sensitive soul, or the intellectual soul.\nHe based this contention on the fact that human temperaments were\nwidely recognized to affect and determine human habits, inclinations,\nand physiognomy (3.4). Following Aristotle\u2019s De motu\nanimalium and Ficino\u2019s Platonic Theology, he\nargued that the actions of the soul are not only spiritual but also\nreal and cause alterations in the body, as is manifest in the physical\neffects of emotions, such as tremors and blushing (3.6). Finally, he\nmaintained that it is possible that the human mind can produce what it\nthinks through real bodily means, such as spirit and blood, in an\nanalogous way to the intelligences\u2019 production\nof changes in the sublunary world through corporal\nintermediaries, namely celestial bodies (3.6).\n\nApplying these causes, Pomponazzi explained that many of those accused\nof necromancy, like the medieval physicians and astrologers Pietro\nd\u2019Abano and Cecco d\u2019Ascoli, were merely very knowledgeable\nand capable of applying actives to passives (4.1). Moreover, it is\npossible that some humans possess extraordinary occult powers\nthat allow them to affect cures through touch, like the kings of\nFrance, or to perform other marvelous feats such as charming snakes\nand opening doors without touching them (4.2). Pomponazzi argued that\nthe powers of imagination can produce real effects. For example, he\ncited the widespread belief that women\u2019s thoughts at the time of\nconception will produce a fetus that is similar to those thoughts.\nTherefore, the power of fascination and imaginative powers transmitted\nthrough vapors might explain unexpected cures and diseases just as\nthey are supposedly responsible for the spread of leprosy and plague\n(4.3). While Pomponazzi admitted that some supposedly magical works\nare acts of deception\u2014such as fraudulent magicians\nconjuring through sieves\u2014he allowed that it might be possible\nthat some men possess natural occult powers that allow them\nto move a sieve or transmit vapors through prayers so that they form\nimages on mirrors (4.4). Pomponazzi used this analysis to respond to\nthe possible objection that these three kinds of natural causes\neliminate the acceptance of miracles. He maintained that many the\ndeeds reported in the Bible can be \u201csuperficially reduced\nto natural causes\u201d, but that some cannot, such as the\nresurrection of Lazarus, the eclipse during the crucifixion of Jesus,\nand the satisfaction of the hunger of a thousand people with five\nloaves of bread and two fish (6.7). Furthermore, while he conceded\nthat there is a remote possibility that the cross found in Saint\nCatherine\u2019s heart and Saint Francis\u2019s stigmata arose from\nnatural causes, he nonetheless stated it is more likely and more pious\nto understand them as miracles (6.8).\n\nPerhaps the most controversial portions of On Incantations\nsurround his explanation of why both pagan and monotheistic societies\ngive credence to the works of demons. His answer derives from his\nlargely Aristotelian and Averroistic conception of the ordering of the\nuniverse (see Perrone Compagni 2011: xxxiii\u2013lxxi). For\nPomponazzi, God is both the final and efficient cause of the universe,\na view he put forth in his earlier quaestiones on\nAverroes\u2019 De substantia orbis (Pomponazzi Corsi\ninediti: 1:299\u2013304). God, possessing knowledge of the\nessences of all species of beings, arranges the universe through the\ncelestial intelligences (10.2). In turn, the celestial intelligences\nthrough the powers of the stars cause the eternal cycles of change in\nthe universe. Accordingly, the entire arrangement of the world,\nincluding human society and religion, reflects and derives from\nGod\u2019s power. Thus, pronouncements in favor of the existence\nof demonic works from serious and important authorities, both\nreligious lawmakers and philosophers including Plato, are the result\nnot of their truth but of their usefulness for creating a virtuous\npopulace. Since a large portion of humanity is incapable of\nunderstanding philosophical truths, lawmakers have created and\nemployed myths or fables to inculcate virtue. The\nlegislator, like the physician who deceives a patient for the\npatient\u2019s own good, composes such fables because they\ncontribute to the larger purpose. These fables should not be\njudged as philosophical doctrines\u2014they contain neither falsity\nor truthfulness per se but have an allegorical or poetic\nmeaning. For Pomponazzi, these myths are not cynically\nused merely to gain political power but are harmonious with the\nuniverse\u2019s nature and order, as arranged by God and the\ncelestial intelligences. Political authority and obedience are\nnecessary for ensuring the persistence of political structures that\nare ordained for humanity, for which nature has given leaders and\norganization just as it has for flock animals, like bees and quail\n(10.2). Consequently, the growth and decline of religions are in\naccordance with the cyclical workings of nature.\n\nPomponazzi\u2019s judgment that the bulk of humanity is incapable of\nunderstanding philosophical truths corresponds to his statements in\nOn the Immortality of the Soul about the differences between\ndivine and human souls and the scarcity of humans who develop\ninto philosophers with comprehensive and accurate knowledge of nature\nand the universe. The inability of nearly all of humanity to\nunderstand true causes has led to further misunderstandings of\nprodigies, omens, divination, and oracles. Pomponazzi held that,\ninstead of being direct messages from God, they are reflections of a\npurposeful and well-ordered universe.\n\nPomponazzi contended that fields such as astrology and physiognomy\nread signs that are causally connected through celestial\ninfluences or physiological links. Celestial prodigies, omens, and\napparitions in the sky both signal and cause future events by\naffecting vapors and spirits that in turn influence the outcomes of\nhuman activity. Some apparitions, such as the recent image of Saint\nCelestine that appeared in the sky above Aquila while its residents\nprayed for protection from excessive rain, result from the collective\nimagination affecting vapors, exhalations, and clouds (see Giglioni\n2010). Moreover, Pomponazzi argued that the\nprodigies\u2019 indicative character explains their purpose and\nfinal cause that is linked to nature, which is interdependent, well\nordered, and under God\u2019s providence. The possibility of using\nprodigies to predict the future is analogous to physicians\u2019\nability to give prognoses for diseases using symptoms that seemingly\nare not directly connected to the maladies. Similarly ignorant people\nhave mistakenly understood the prognostications of sibyls and other\nseers as being caused by demons when in fact they possess either\nextraordinary occult natural powers or are caused by astral\npowers.\n\nInvoking celestial powers, occult virtues, the force of the\nimagination, and the intermediary actions of vapors and spirits,\nPomponazzi contended that by using only Aristotelian natural\nprinciples it was possible to save or explain seemingly miraculous,\nprodigious, and preternatural phenomena. Pomponazzi accepted the\nveracity of many of these phenomena, trusting for the most part\nin the accounts of contemporaries and ancient histories (12.7). At\ntimes, however, he rejected accounts from history as implausible, such\nas tales of Vespasian curing with his saliva and his foot (8.1).\nNevertheless, in his view, the numerous historical\nnarratives of presages, oracles, and divination confirmed\ntheir reality (10.2). \n\nIn the closing of On Incantations, Pomponazzi stated that\nwhile he believed that what the Peripatetics would have probably\n(verisimiliter) believed is in agreement with Christianity,\nhe would nevertheless revoke the entire work and submit himself to the\nCatholic Church in the event that this writing were judged to\noppose Catholic doctrine (Peroratio.1). A number of\ninterpreters have found this conclusion to be disingenuous,\nand the Holy Office placed the work on the Index of Prohibited\nBooks by the 1570s. A censor wrote that while Pomponazzi put\nforth arguments that seem to undermine the existence of miracles he\ndid make strong ones in their favor (Baldini & Spruit 2009: vol.\n1, tome 3, 2279).\n5. Fate and Providence\n\nSeveral months after Pomponazzi completed On Incantations in\n1520, he finished De fato, de libero arbitrio, et de\npraedestinatione (On Fate, Free Will, and\nPredestination), a work that addressed Alexander of\nAphrodisias\u2019s De fato (On Fate), which\nhad been printed in Girolamo Bagolino\u2019s Latin translation in\n1516. Alexander criticized Stoic deterministic understandings of\ncausation because they deny the possibility of chance, contingency,\nand human choice. In On Fate, Pomponazzi largely sided not\nwith Alexander but in favor of his Stoic opposition.\n\nThe premise of Pomponazzi\u2019s arguments coincides with his\nunderstanding of causation presented in On Incantations. The\nwork also reaffirms the limitations placed on the human intellect in\nOn the Immortality of the Soul. In On Fate,\nPomponazzi argued that God, as efficient cause of the world, acts on\nthe sublunary world using the celestial bodies. God is the principal\ncause, and the celestial bodies are the instrumental cause of\naccidental effects in the sublunary world, which Alexander and Thomas\nAquinas viewed as contingent and without a cause (1.7.II/15). The\ncelestial bodies\u2019 motion, contiguous to the lower world, drives\nand determines alterations on earth. Therefore, accidental effects,\nultimately resulting from God acting as an efficient cause, occur by\nnecessity (1.7.II/16). Pomponazzi maintained that they are mistakenly\ncalled contingent as a result of human ignorance of causes and future\nevents but not from any irregularity in matter, natural powers, or\ncelestial influences. Rather, all accidental effects and what appears\nto result from luck or chance can be traced back to fixed causes\n(1.7.II/23\u201326).\n\nApplying this deterministic framework, Pomponazzi rejected\nAlexander\u2019s understanding of free will as the ability to choose\nbetween alternatives. Pomponazzi maintained that human will functions\njust like the rest of nature. It depends on an eternal, external\nmover, namely God\u2019s will and the celestial\nmotions (1.9.2.10). Just as for other natural beings, if there is\na potentiality and no impediment, by necessity the potentiality will\nbe realized. Thus, the human will reacts to external factors according\nto its powers and the absence of impediments (1.9.2.12). Consequently,\nthe human will depends on higher, universal causes. The apparent\nability of humans to deliberate between choices using reason, however,\nis an illusion because every actor is in fact directed toward one of\nthe choices by external causes (1.9.3.2\u20134).\n\nThe rejection of the existence of free will presented difficult\nramifications for Christian ethics and theology, which depend on the\nfreedom to choose a virtuous life. In resolving these difficulties,\nPomponazzi chose fate over freedom because he thought that it better\npreserved God\u2019s complete power and providence. If God had\ngranted freedom to humans, the lack, or extreme rarity, of truly\nvirtuous humans on earth demonstrates the absence of a truly\nprovidential plan in which humans\u2019 freedom to choose a completely\nmoral good life is realized. Similarly, if humans have the ability of\nfree choice, God must not know these future decisions and humans are\nthereby limited with respect to his knowledge and power. As a\nconsequence, Pomponazzi opted for fate and determinism, rejecting what\nhe considered to be a denial of God\u2019s providence, omnipotence,\nand omniscience. The world\u2019s order and the cosmic laws that\ngovern the eternal motions of the universe include the existence of\ngood and evil as part of the necessary cycles of change.\n\nAt the beginning of the third book, Pomponazzi maintained that his\nnaturalistic arguments (argumentationes naturales) of the\nfirst two books were by no means certain and were to be rejected if\nthey contradicted the teachings of the Catholic Church (3.1.1). He\nthen proposed to find solutions to the questions of fate and divine\nprovidence that preserve free will. Accordingly, Pomponazzi, seemingly\nin opposition to the arguments outlined in the first two books, opened\nthe door for the possibility of freedom of choice that potentially\ncould be in line with Christian theology by identifying the human will\nwith the intellect. He argued that God limited his omnipotence and\nforeknowledge, thereby allowing for the possibility of future\ncontingents. This divine self-limitation allows for the possibility\nthat the human intellect, through the power of deliberation, is\ncapable of suspending predetermined acts of volition that go against\nthe moral interests of the actor, thereby being able to choose to sin\nor not sin. Human liberty is defined in negative terms, a privation\nand a suspension, since the will does not produce action in these\ninstances but only impedes it (3.8). While some commentators have seen\nthis line of argumentation as a potential \u201cline of defense for\nthe opinio christiana\u201d (Poppi 1988: 659), it was\nspecifically condemned in 1576 by a censor who placed the work on the\nIndex of Prohibited Books (Baldini & Spruit 2009: vol. 1,\ntome 3: 2279\u201380).\n\nThe fifth and final book of On Fate continues the theological\ndiscussions of the previous two books, turning to an examination of\npredestination, a concept that according to Pomponazzi is not\nmentioned by philosophers but is key to Christian theology, being tied\nto doctrines on fate and God\u2019s providence. In this book, he put\nforward two distinct, incompatible accounts of predestination. The\nfirst account argues that God does not act in an indeterminate or\ncontingent manner and, therefore, has determined everything for\neternity, eliminating the importance or even the possibility of human\nchoice (5.2). The second account argues that God has created the\nuniverse perfect with respect to all its parts, including humans who\nhave the capacity to choose or refrain from sin. God,\nhowever, has not made all humans equal with respect to their ability\nto obtain perfection, and only some have been granted grace or are\n\u201celected\u201d. This election, or grace is not certain, as\nthose that have been chosen still have the possibility to choose to\nsin and thereby forfeit the grace that had been conceded to them. The\nchosen, however, who follow God\u2019s will can be certain to obtain\nthe glory that God has conditionally promised (5.7). The epilogue\nreiterates his conviction that the Stoic conception of the universe is\npreferable. He maintained that if the universe is like an animal, the\nsublunary world represents excrements, while the heavenly spheres are\nperfect and free of evil. Finally, he confessed that he has never\nunderstood how Christian theologians preserve divine providence and\nhuman free will, describing it as an illusion and a trick\n(5.epilogus.7\u201310).\n\nThat the first two books of On Fate at times seem to be in\ndisagreement with the latter three presents difficulties for\ninterpreting it, having led some scholars to assume Pomponazzi\u2019s\ntrue position corresponds to arguments in On Incantations\nand is found in the first books (see Poppi 1988). Others\nhave seen the last three books as an attempt to undermine Christianity\nby demonstrating the weakness or incompatibility of the Christian\ndoctrines of predestination and God\u2019s omnipotence and\nomniscience (see Di Napoli 1970). Alternatively, scholars have seen\nthe latter books to be a genuine attempt to critique and reform\nThomistic theology (see Perrone Compagni 2004: cix\u2013clviii) that\noffers innovative solutions to outstanding theological problems (see\nRamberti 2007: 109\u201350).\n6. Later Works\n\nPomponazzi elaborated on many themes found in On Fate, On\nIncantations, and On the Immortality of the Soul in the\nfinal years of his life while he lectured on Aristotle\u2019s\nParva naturalia, De generatione et corruptione,\nDe partibus animalium, and Meteorologica. The\nonly new work printed during these years was On Growth and\nNutrition (1521), which discussed a central topic of De\ngeneratione et corruptione. The work is explicitly naturalistic\nin outlook and provides potential natural explanations for what some\nconsidered miracles\u2014that St. Paul\u2019s tongue spoke after his\nhead was severed from his body\u2014in addition to asserting that the\nhuman intellect requires a bodily organ (1.11, 1.23; see Ramberti\n2010).\n\nPomponazzi reaffirmed his views about the mortality of the soul in his\nlectures on De generatione et corruptione given in 1522\n(Nardi 1965: 251\u201368). His lectures on De partibus\nanimalium display his skepticism toward complete human knowledge\nof the natural world (see Perfetti 1999). This skepticism expressed in\nthe biological works also appears in his lectures on Aristotle\u2019s\nMeteorologica, in which he puts forward doubts about\nknowledge of the final causes of disasters and the certainty of a\nnumber of meteorological explanations (see Martin 2011: 30\u201333,\n44\u201350). In these lectures he followed several teachings of\nOn Incantations, affirming the place of prodigies in the\nordering of the universe and the stars\u2019 role in causing sublunary\nchange (see Graiff 1976).\n7. Influence and Legacy\n\nGiven the controversial nature of many of his writings and the\ndifficulty in interpreting his works, Pomponazzi\u2019s influence was\nvaried. Opponents accused him of undermining organized religion,\nabetting Lutheranism, and contributing to the development of atheism.\nAlternatively, he has been praised for promoting intellectual freedom,\nimproving methods for interpreting Aristotle, and preparing the way\nfor the materialism and positivism of modern science.\n\nAlthough his writings do not appear to follow the demand of\nApostolici regiminis that philosophers defend Catholic dogma\nto the best of their ability, ecclesiastical authorities did little to\nenforce the Fifth Lateran Council. While never convicted of\nheresy, or even tried for it, nevertheless after the\npublication of On the Immortality of the Soul he\nfaced significant turmoil, including accusations of heterodoxy\nand the burning of copies of his books at Venice. Some\nadversaries, such as Ambrogio Flandino, associated On Fate\nwith Martin Luther\u2019s and Jan Hus\u2019s denials of free will,\nan association that continued throughout the sixteenth century (Del\nSoldato 2010). That Guglielmo Gratarolo, a Calvinist exiled from\nBergamo living in Basel, printed On Incantations and On\nFate potentially confirmed perceived links to heterodoxy\n(Maclean 2005). As the Counter Reformation more clearly defined\nCatholic orthodoxy in the second half of the sixteenth century, many\nCatholic theologians and philosophers, especially Jesuits, saw his\nteachings as noxious and a potential source of heresy. During the\nseventeenth century, concerns over Pomponazzi grew in part due to the\nconvicted and executed heretic Giulio Cesare Vanini (d. 1619), who\nappropriated a number of Pomponazzi\u2019s arguments. Subsequently,\nmany scholars, including Fran\u00e7ois Garasse, Marin Mersenne, and\nTommaso Campanella, linked him to atheism and to Niccol\u00f2\nMachiavelli\u2019s promotion of religious imposture as a political\ntool. Yet he still had his defenders. The erudite Frenchman Gabriel\nNaud\u00e9 praised Pomponazzi both for his wit and for his\nhistorically accurate interpretation of Aristotle. As a result,\nPomponazzi became linked to seventeenth-century libertinism (Martin\n2014: 94\u201395, 124\u201344).\n\nDespite numerous negative assessments, some sixteenth-century\nphilosophers pursued Pomponazzi\u2019s approach. For example, Simone\nPorzio, a professor of philosophy at Pisa, followed his mortalist and\nAlexandrian take on the human intellect (Del Soldato 2010). Even\nthough many throughout the seventeenth century condemned his\nview that the soul dies with the body, Pierre Bayle absolved\nPomponazzi of impiety, found him to be an example of freedom of\nthought, and praised him for his ethical teachings that spurned the\ninducements of the afterlife (Bayle 1740: vol. 3, 777\u201383). In\nthe nineteenth century, he was championed by positivists, such as\nErnest Renan and Roberto Ardig\u00f2, who upheld Pomponazzi as a\nmodel for the scientific spirit that opposed religious oppression\n(Ardig\u00f2 1869; Renan 1852: 284\u201388). During the twentieth\ncentury, a number of scholars endorsed the views of\nseventeenth-century libertines, interpreting Pomponazzi as insincere,\na promoter of religious imposture, or as a determined enemy of\nChristianity (see Busson 1957: 44\u201369; Charbonnel 1919:\n220\u201374, 389\u2013438). Accordingly, he gained among some the\nepithet \u201cRadical Philosopher\u201d (see Pine 1986). Other\nscholars, following the leads of Bruno Nardi and Paul Oskar\nKristeller, placed him in the context of the secular tradition of\nmedieval philosophy that separated theology from philosophy (Bianchi\n2008). Under that interpretation, Pomponazzi was not necessarily an\ninstigator or harbinger of the conflicts between church and\nscience of the modern period but rather better understood as\ncontinuing scholastic philosophical practices, which\nincluded open inquiry, that took root in the thirteenth\ncentury.\n",
