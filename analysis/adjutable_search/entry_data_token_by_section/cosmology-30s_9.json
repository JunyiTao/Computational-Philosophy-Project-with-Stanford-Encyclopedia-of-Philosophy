    "main_text": "The Great Cosmological Debate Begins: 1933\u20131934 || Dingle\u2019s First Attacks\n4.1 Dingle\u2019s First Attacks\n\nFew others would ever go so far as Eddington\u2019s ontological\nheroism; yet epistemological and methodological heroism in the fight\nagainst Milne was not rare. Chief hero in this aspect of the attack on\nMilne was Herbert Dingle, a highly respected astrophysicist, and\nthen-secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society. Dingle\u2019s\ninitial foray appeared as a response to Milne\u2019s first detailed\npresentation of kinematic relativity (Milne 1933). After claiming that\nwhile kinematic relativity did not differ appreciably from\nrelativistic cosmology in its mathematical formalism or observable\nconsequences, Dingle asserted that, on the other hand, it invited\nspecial criticism because it renounced \u201cthe fundamental\nprinciples of scientific method\u201d, namely, \u201cNewton\u2019s\nprinciple of induction from phenomena\u201d (Dingle 1933, p. 178).\nDingle was never to relent in his attacks upon Milne\u2019s\nhypothetico-deductivism, at all times rejecting the methodology as\neven a possible candidate for acceptance by genuine science.\n\nDingle\u2019s article appeared back-to-back with an appraisal of\nkinematic relativity by the important American cosmologist H. P.\nRobertson (Robertson 1933a). Robertson focussed upon Milne\u2019s\nhypothetico-deducivism as well, noting that the cosmological principle\nin kinematic relativity functions as an a priori rule, rather\nthan as an empirical generalization, its status in relativistic\ncosmology. Robertson otherwise is not especially taken with\nMilne\u2019s theory, limiting himself to remarks suggesting that,\nwhere they can be compared, kinematic relativity and relativistic\ncosmology apparently are similar in physical content. As we shall\nshortly see, Robertson\u2019s later work strongly belied this earlier\napparent indifference to Milne\u2019s theory.\n",
