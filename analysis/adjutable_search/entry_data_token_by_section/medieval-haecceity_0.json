    "main_text": "Individuation and the identity of indiscernibles\n1. Individuation and the identity of indiscernibles\n\nThe possible existence of such non-qualitative properties as\nexplanations of numerical distinction between substances can perhaps\nbe made plausible by considering a modern equivalent to the medieval\nthought-experiment about angels, namely, the famous counterexample to\nthe identity of indiscernibles suggested by Max Black. A\nwants to defend the principle, and B attack it, and\nB does so by proposing the following case:\n\nIsn\u2019t it logically possible that the universe should have contained\nnothing but two exactly similar spheres? We might suppose that each\nwas made of chemically pure iron, had a diameter of one mile, that\nthey had the same temperature, colour, and so on, and that nothing\nelse existed. Then every quality and relational characteristic of the\none would also be a property of the other. Now if what I am describing\nis logically possible, it is not impossible for two things to have all\ntheir properties in common. This seems to me to refute the\nprinciple. (Black [1952], 156)\n\n\nClearly, if the identity of indiscernibles is understood \u2013 as\nLeibniz intended \u2013 to assert that any two individuals must\ndiffer in some qualitative or relational way, B\u2019s\ncounterexample seems sufficient to refute it. But it seems that there\nis an easy answer available to A. For A could assert\nthat the two spheres differ in some property or constituent that is\nneither qualitative nor relational: they could differ by\nhaecceity. This leaves intact a trivial reading of Leibniz\n(that if individual x is distinct from individual y,\nthen there must be some property had by x and not by\ny, or vice versa), and thus an apparently true version of the\nprinciple secure. Haecceities may not be the only way to preserve the\nprinciple against B\u2019s counterexample. But the solution gives\nsome prima facie plausibility to the possibility of\nhaecceities. After all, if haecceities are required at least in cases\nof exact replicas, then it seems hard to resist the conclusion that\nthey are responsible for individuation, period.\n\nHere I assume, with Scotus, that a haecceity is a constituent of the\nitem it individuates. I will return later on to theories that make the\nindividuation of particulars primitive. Scotus believes that the\nhaecceity must be a constituent, and the reason is that he grants some\nkind of reality to universals too (common natures, in the technical\nmedieval parlance) \u2013 and that the reality of a common nature\nrequires the reality of the haecceity, and that both be constituents\nof the particular. So, haecceities are bare particulars, but they are\nnot supposed to underlie properties. Some medieval Aristotelians hold\nthat matter, construed as a substrate for forms and properties,\nindividuates; and it would be possible to hold that the individuation\nof a substance is explained by some bare particular that underlies\nproperties. Scotus rejects the view that matter could be responsible\nfor individuation, on the grounds that we require too an explanation\nfor the individuation of (chunks of) matter (Scotus,\nOrdinatio II, d. 3, p. 1, qq. 5\u20136, n. 187 (Scotus [OO],\n7:483; Spade (1994), 106\u2013107)). Neither would Scotus have been\nable to make any sense of a bare particular in the sense of a bare\npossessor of qualities, a view that would doubtless have struck him as\ninconsistent with essentialism (on this, see Park [1990]). Given that\nthe argument for the reality of haecceities (as constituents of\nparticulars) rests on the reality of common natures, we have first to\nprovide an explanation of Scotus\u2019s theory of common natures, followed,\nin a third section, by a description of the theory of haecceity and\nthe relation of these two theories to each other.\n",
