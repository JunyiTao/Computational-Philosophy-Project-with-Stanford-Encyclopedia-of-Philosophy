    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n3. Metaphysics\n\nThe divisions between metaphysics, natural philosophy, psychology, and\ntheology are permeable for Ibn Rushd, and the systematic character of\nhis thought makes it difficult to treat any part in isolation. (See\nthe start of EpiMeta for his division of the sciences.) Here\nour method of proceeding is to begin with the most general principles\nof being, and then to turn, in the next section, to their causal\nrelationships.\n\nOf the various kinds of being, substances are what exist in the most\nproper sense (EpiMeta 4.138 {125}). Among substances, the\nmost familiar are concrete individuals like dogs and stones\n(EpiMeta 2.58 {43}). But these are composite entities, and\nsince the principles of a substance are themselves even more properly\nconsidered to be substances (EpiMeta 1.31 {15\u201316};\nLongAnima II.8), the most fundamental substances in the\nsensible realm are the metaphysical ingredients of composite\nsubstances, matter and form (LongMeta VII.44 {960}).\n\nUnderlying all change, and enduring through it, is homogeneous matter,\ndefined simply by its potentiality\u2014that is, its potential to\nserve as subject for any earthly form (SubstOrb 1.50).\nConceived of without form, it is perpetually enduring and numerically\none everywhere: \u201call transient bodies share this body that is\nnumerically one\u201d (SubstOrb 2.87), because it is\n\u201cdeprived of the divisions of individual forms\u201d\n(LongMeta XII.14 {1473}). Ibn Rushd worries in predictable\nways about the reality of this so-called prime matter (m\u0101dda\n\u02be\u016bl\u0101). On the one hand, he consistently counts it\nas a substance (e.g., ParaAnima 2.115). On the other hand,\nmatter so-conceived is a \u201cpure privation\u201d and \u201cdoes\nnot exist outside of the soul\u201d (LongMeta XII.14\n{1473\u20134}). He offers the less-than-perspicuous compromise\nformula that prime matter lies \u201chalfway, as it were, between\nabsolute non-being and actual being\u201d (quasi medium inter\nnon-esse simpliciter et esse in actu) (LongPhys I.70;\nParaPhys I.3.3.276).\n\nMatter exists only when actualized by form, but the first form it\nreceives is not the nature of the composite substance (dog, stone,\netc.) but instead the \u201cindeterminate dimensions\u201d\n(al-ab\u02bf\u0101d ghayr al-ma\u1e25d\u016bdat) that give\nmatter its corporeal character: \u201cthe three dimensions that\nconstitute the nature of body are the first state in matter, and\nmatter cannot be devoid of them in any instance of generation: not\nthat they exist in matter in actuality, but rather in some kind of\npotentiality different from the potentiality in which matter is\nconstituted\u201d (ParaGC I.4.26 {32}; SubstOrb\n1.55). In postulating a persisting extended substratum beneath all\nphysical change, Ibn Rushd has been said to take a step toward the\nres extensa of seventeenth-century mechanical philosophy\n(Hyman 1965). But his conception of matter, far from making further\nforms unnecessary, explains how multiple forms can be instantiated in\nthe same material stuff: \u201cthe presence of dimension in prime\nmatter is a prerequisite for the existence of contraries\u201d\n(EpiMeta 3.126 {112}). Since forms, by their nature, are\nalways individuals\u2014universals, Ibn Rushd insists, do not exist\noutside the soul (EpiMeta 2.73\u20135\n{57\u20139})\u2014the theory does not require a \u201cprinciple of\nindividuation\u201d for form. Extended matter does, however, serve as\nwhat might be called a principle of multiplication. If the material\nrealm were not extended, \u201cthere would exist in it only one form\nat a given time\u201d (SubstOrb 1.60; Di Giovanni 2007).\n\nAlongside matter, the other internal principle of composite substances\nis form, and so form too counts as a substance (LongAnima\nII.2), and indeed is substance in the most proper sense of the term\n(Amerini 2008; Di Giovanni 2012). Substantial forms can be\ndistinguished from accidents in that a subject (a dog, a stone)\nendures through the gain and loss of its accidents, whereas when the\nsubstantial form of the subject departs, the subject ceases to exist\nor exists only homonymously (ParaAnima 2.120)\u2014as one\nmight speak of cremating one\u2019s grandfather. Interpreters have\ndisagreed on whether Ibn Rushd allows a single substance to have\nmultiple substantial forms. But at least sometimes he seems to suppose\nthat one substance has just one form, as when he holds that \u201cif\nprime matter were to have its own form, it would receive no other\nform, while enduring, but would immediately be corrupted as soon as\nthat other form were generated\u201d (LongPhys I.69; see\nSubstOrb 1.50). If elsewhere he seems to suggest that any\nnecessary feature of a thing will count as a substantial form of it,\nthis may mean merely that a substantial form is a composite of\nmultiple discrete, incomplete constituents (Di Giovanni 2011; Cerami\n2015, 521\u20134). Ibn Rushd is clear, at any rate, that the essence\n(dh\u0101t) or quiddity (m\u0101hiyya) of a thing is\naccounted for entirely by its form, rather than by its form and matter\n(LongMeta VII.34 {896}). Thus, \u201cform is the primary\nsubstance only because it is the cause of the determinate substance\nand the determinate substances come to be substance only by it\u201d\n(LongMeta VII.5 {761k}).\n\nAccidents, which can come and go from a substance, are inseparable\nfrom that substance, and are caused by it (EpiMeta 2.56 {42};\nLongMeta XII.25 {1532\u20133}), but are not themselves a\npart of the substance (LongAnima II.4; Tah\u0101fut\nI.6.216 {359}). They do not have existence in an absolute sense, but\nonly relationally (LongMeta XII.3 {1415}; EpiMeta\n1.28 {12}), and indeed Ibn Rushd generally does not refer to them as a\nform (\u1e63\u016bra), preferring to reserve that term for\nthe substantial form.\n\nThe earthly realm we have been describing is just one small and\nrelatively insignificant part of what there is. Much more exalted, and\na much worthier subject of intellectual contemplation, is the eternal\nheavenly domain. Here Ibn Rushd broadly follows standard premodern\ncosmology in describing the eight celestial spheres of the moon, the\nsun, the five planets, and the fixed stars. These spheres are solid,\ntransparent bodies, spinning around the earth, luminous only at those\npoints where the sphere thickens (SubstOrb 2.92). Celestial\nbodies are composites of matter and form, but of an utterly different\nkind. Their matter is actually existent, incorruptible and\nindivisible, with a determinate size and shape (SubstOrb\n2.82; LongMeta XII.10 {1447}). Celestial matter is in\npotentiality only with regard to motion, and that motion, although\ngenerally circular, is extremely complex, with as many as 55 distinct\nmotions identifiable among the eight spheres (LongMeta XII.48\n{1679}). Each of these distinct motions requires a distinct\nactualizing form (EpiMeta 4.147 {135}; LongMeta\nXII.43 {1645}), but these are not material forms, inhering in the\ncelestial matter (since that matter is already actualized). Instead,\nthese celestial forms are separate and, like all forms not inhering in\nmatter, they are therefore intellectual: \u201cif there are these\nforms that have existence inasmuch as they are not in matter, then\nthese are necessarily separate intellects, since there is no third\nkind of existence for forms qua forms\u201d\n(EpiMeta 4.150 {139}; Incoherence I.6 {338}). In\naddition to intellects, these forms have desires, and indeed are aptly\nreferred to as souls (LongMeta XII.36 {1593};\nSubstOrb 1.71, 2.81). It is this desire, rather than any sort\nof physical contact, that moves the spheres, with the beauty of its\ncelestial intelligence serving as a final cause, and its desire\nefficiently moving the sphere. Far from being cold bodies in empty\nspace, these spheres are \u201calive, full of pleasure, and delighted\nin themselves\u201d (EpiMeta 4.162 {152}). Adding to their\ndelight is their partial understanding of and desire for the first and\nunmoved mover, which moves all of the spheres through their desire for\nthis highest cause (LongMeta XII.44 {1649\u201350};\nEpiMeta 4.154 {142}). (For this cosmology in its historical\ncontext, see Wolfson 1962 and Endress 1995.)\n",
