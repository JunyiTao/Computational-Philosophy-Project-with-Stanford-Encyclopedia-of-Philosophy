Andy Egan et al. (2005) argue that Relativism, rather than EC, gets the semantics of epistemic modals right. According to Relativism (see Section 6), the truth values of knowledge sentences depend upon the standards in play in the contexts in which they are assessed, as opposed to the standards operative in either the subject\u2019s or the attributor\u2019s context. Bach (2005, 66) and Feldman (2004, 27) question whether the contextualist model might apply to one\u2019s thoughts about whether various \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentences express truths. Timothy Williamson (2005a, 100\u2013101) and John Hawthorne (2004, 109\u2013110) raise related concerns about the preservation of information in memory and testimony: storing or conveying the information that \u2018S knows that p [plus some date index]\u2019 may lead to problems, since subsequent uses of that information may occur in contexts in which different standards are in effect. In addition, Williamson (ibid., 102ff.) argues that EC, because it privileges attributor over subject factors, does not respect the autonomy of the subject, qua agent, in settling the contents of questions involved in practical decision making. And Hawthorne (ibid., 98ff.) contends that EC has implausible consequences for reports of propositional attitudes in which \u2018know\u2019 occurs.\nWhether such criticisms are effective against EC is controversial. (See DeRose 1995, 6\u20137 and Rieber 1998, 197, e.g., on the extension of EC to one\u2019s thoughts; DeRose 2006, Section 4; 2009, 161\u2013166; and Cohen 2005, 201\u2013206 reply to Hawthorne\u2019s arguments concerning belief reports.) However, whatever we make of these issues, not to mention the ones earlier raised, they could give us reason to reject EC only if there were some viable alternative explanation of the relevant data\u2014in particular, of the apparently inconsistent \u201cknowledge\u201d claims described in Section 3. Whereas, if we could explain those data without introducing a novel view of the semantics of \u2018know\u2019, that would considerably weaken the case for EC.\n",
