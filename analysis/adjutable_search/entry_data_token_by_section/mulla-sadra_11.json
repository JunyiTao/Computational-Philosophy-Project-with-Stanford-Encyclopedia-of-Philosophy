    "main_text": "Noetics \u2014 Epistemology and Psychology || The Nature of Knowledge\n4.4 The Nature of Knowledge\n\nMulla Sadra inherited a variety of theories ranging from Platonic\nrecollection (anamnesis) and division to Peripatetic\nsyllogistics, definitions and axiomatic science. Broadly speaking, our\nauthor recognises three different epistemological methods. The first\nis a co-relational model of knowledge (Mulla Sadra 2001-5, III: 317).\nIn this model, knowledge is a relation between a subject and an object\nthat is devoid of cognitive content in itself and is not intrinsically\nintelligible. It is a property of the knower and devoid of actual\nprocess. Knowledge is dispositional. As such, this theory is marked by\nradical internalism. This is a view associated with later mediaeval\ntheologians (especially Fakhr al-Din Razi) and rejected. It is\nunacceptable to Mulla Sadra precisely because it is predicated upon a\ndenial of mental being. According to this model, knowledge is negative\ninsofar as it is solipsistic (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, III: 318).\n\nThe second model is the correspondence or representation theory of\nknowledge by apprehension (al-\u2018ilm al-husuli\nal-irtisami). \u2018I know that P\u2019 means that\nthere is an external object P that corresponds to an internal\nconcept P. The mind is thus the \u2018mirror of\nnature\u2019. It judges a relationship between the extra-mental\nobject and the mental picture of it as described in\nWittgenstein\u2019s picture theory. The inadequacies of this model\nare clear. It fails to account for conceivables that do not exist.\nKnowledge is the correspondence between the object and the subject,\nand mediated. It presupposes the existence of independent extra-mental\nentities \u2018out there\u2019 and is strongly dualistic. The mind\nabstracts the form from the matter of the thing and represents it. As\nsuch it is a negative fact. One can only grasp the form in the mind\nsince the essences of things are not available to us. But Mulla Sadra\nargues that the consequent is clearly false, so the antecedent is as\nwell (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, III: 316). They are available to us\ninsofar as they exist and are present to us. Knowledge is not an\nabstraction. The accidental material forms of intelligibles thus\ngrasped are not the true objects of knowledge; those are the pure\nintelligibles experienced directly (Ha\u2019iri Yazdi 1992: 35). This\nPeripatetic doctrine is rejected. It is quite wrong to assume in this\nmodel that perception is so mediated that it requires an interface\nbetween the mind and external objects (often called qualia).\nThis model does not actually yield the reality of the thing, though it\ndoes seek the essence of things. Mulla Sadra quotes Avicenna (from\nal-Ta\u2018liqat, Avicenna 1973: 34).\n\nThe realities of things are not available to the human; we only know\nthe specific attributes, the concomitant attributes and the accidents\nof things, and we do not know the differentiae that are constituents\nof everything, one of which indicates its reality. Rather, we know\nthat there are things that have specific attributes and accidents\n(Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, I: 461).\n\n\nIt remains the case that Mulla Sadra accepts a correspondence theory\nof knowledge though it is not his preferred option for arriving at\nindubitable knowledge.\n\nHowever, these models are insufficient and do not yield certainty,\nwhich is only available through the third model of knowledge by\npresence.\n\nBeing can only be known by visionary presential knowledge\n(al-\u2018ilm al-huduri al-shuhudi), and the inner-reality\nof light can only be perceived by an immediate illuminative\ncorrelation (al-idafa al-ishraqiyya) and actual presence\n(al-hudur al-\u2018ayni). If something is known by formal\nknowledge, it changes the reality of it (Mulla Sadra 2001\u20135, I:\n489).\n\n\nThis formulation draws heavily upon Suhrawardi\u2019s earlier\nexposition of presential knowledge (e.g. Suhrawardi 1998: 79\u201381)\nbut with the distinction that Mulla Sadra explicitly refers to reality\nin terms of existence whereas for Suhrawardi existence is an empty\nconcept. Knowledge by presence extends the identity thesis posited in\nthe ancient tradition to entities beyond the divine and the pure\nintellects and in effect reverses the process of making sense of human\nknowledge that one finds in knowledge by representation. That latter\nprojects this model of human knowledge onto the divine and hence\ncannot fathom how God might know particulars in their particularity.\nWhereas knowledge by presence extends the nature of divine knowledge\nto the human and resolves the problem of God\u2019s knowledge of\nparticulars by insisting upon the unitive nature of that\nknowledge.\n",
