    "main_text": "Homo Economicus and Expected Utility Theory || Limits to Logical Omniscience\n1.3 Limits to Logical Omniscience\n\nMost formal models of judgment and decision making entail logical\nomniscience\u2014complete knowledge of all that logically\nfollows from one\u2019s current commitments combined with any set of\noptions considered for choice\u2014which is as psychologically\nunrealistic as it is difficult, technically, to avoid (Stalnaker\n1991). A descriptive theory that presumes or a prescriptive theory\nthat recommends to disbelieve a claim when the evidence is logically\ninconsistent, for example, will be unworkable when the belief in\nquestion is sufficiently complicated for all but logically omniscient\nagents, even for non-omniscient agents that nevertheless have access\nto unlimited computational resources (Kelly & Schulte 1995).\n\nThe problem of logical omniscience is particularly acute for expected\nutility theory in general, and the theory of subjective probability in\nparticular. For the postulates of subjective probability imply that an\nagent knows all the logical consequences of her commitments, thereby\nmandating logical omniscience. This limits the applicability of the\ntheory, however. For example, it prohibits having uncertain judgments\nabout mathematical and logical statements. In an article from 1967,\n\u201cDifficulties in the theory of personal probability\u201d,\nreported in Hacking 1967 and Seidenfeld, Schervish, & Kadane 2012\nbut misprinted in Savage 1967, Savage raises the problem of logical\nomniscience for the subjective theory of probability:\n\n\nThe analysis should be careful not to prove too much; for some\ndepartures from theory are inevitable, and some even laudable. For\nexample, a person required to risk money on a remote digit of \\(\\pi\\)\nwould, in order to comply fully with the theory, have to compute that\ndigit, though this would really be wasteful if the cost of computation\nwere more than the prize involved. For the postulates of the theory\nimply that you should behave in accordance with the logical\nimplication of all that you know. Is it possible to improve the theory\nin this respect, making allowances within it for the cost of thinking,\nor would that entail paradox, as I am inclined to believe but unable\nto demonstrate? (Savage 1967 excerpted from Savage\u2019s\nprepublished draft; see notes in Seidenfeld et al. 2012)\n\n\nResponses to Savage\u2019s problem include a game-theoretic treatment\nproposed by I.J. Good (1983), which swaps the extensional variable\nthat is necessarily true for an intensional variable representing an\naccomplice who knows the necessary truth but withholds enough\ninformation from you for you to be (coherently) uncertain about what\nhe knows. This trick changes the subject of your uncertainty, from a\nnecessarily true proposition that you cannot coherently doubt to a\ncoherent guessing game about that truth facilitated by your\naccomplice\u2019s incomplete description. Another response sticks to\nthe classical line that failures of logical omniscience are deviations\nfrom the normative standard of perfect rationality but introduces an\nindex for incoherence to accommodate reasoning with incoherent\nprobability assessments (Schervish, Seidenfeld, & Kadane 2012). A\nthird approach, suggested by de Finetti (1970), is to restrict\npossible states of affairs to observable states with a finite\nverifiable procedure\u2014which may rule out theoretical states or\nany other that does not admit a verification protocol. Originally,\nwhat de Finetti was after was a principled way to construct a\npartition over possible outcomes to distinguish serious possible\noutcomes of an experiment from wildly implausible but logically\npossible outcomes, yielding a method for distinguishing between\ngenuine doubt and mere \u201cpaper doubts\u201d (Peirce 1955). Other\nproposals follow de Finetti\u2019s line by tightening the\nadmissibility criteria and include epistemically possible\nevents, which are events that are logically consistent with the\nagent\u2019s available information; apparently possible\nevents, which include any event by default unless the agent has\ndetermined that it is inconsistent with his information; and\npragmatically possible events, which only includes events\nthat are judged sufficiently important (Walley 1991: 2.1).\n\nThe notion of apparently possible refers to a procedure for\ndetermining inconsistency, which is a form of bounded procedural\nrationality\n (section 2).\n The challenges of avoiding paradox, which Savage alludes to, are\nformidable. However, work on bounded fragments of Peano arithmetic\n(Parikh 1971) provide coherent foundations for exploring these ideas,\nwhich have been taken up specifically to formulate bounded-extensions\nof default logic for apparent possibility (Wheeler 2004) and\nmore generally in models of computational rationality (Lewis,\nHowes, & Singh 2014).\n",
