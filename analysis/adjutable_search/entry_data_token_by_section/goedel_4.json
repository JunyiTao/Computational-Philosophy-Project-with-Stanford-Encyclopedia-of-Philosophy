More exactly:\n\n\nTheorem 5.\n\nGiven any recursive function f there are provable sentences\n\u03c6 of arithmetic such that the shortest proof is greater than\nf(\u2308\u03c6\u2309) in length.\n\n\nThe proof we will outline is sensitive to the particular concept we\nuse for the length of a proof. Another possibility, and the one that\nG\u00f6del has in mind, is the number of formulas in the proof. Buss\n(see below) proves the theorem in either case, so both cases are\nresolved.\n\nProof: Let f be total recursive function. By\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Fixed Point theorem there is a formula\n\u03c6(n) stating \u2018\u03c6(n) has no proof in PA\nshorter than f(n)\u2019. This is tenable if the\nlength is measured by number of symbols, because we only need to\nsearch through finitely many proofs shorter than\nf(n). Note that \u03c6(n) is true for all\nn, for if \u03c6(n) were false, then there would be a\nshort proof of \u03c6(n), and hence by soundness\n\u03c6(n) would be true, a contradiction: \u03c6(n)\nwould both true and false. This can be formalized in PA and thus we\nget the result that for each n the sentence \u03c6(n)\nis provable in PA. Since \u03c6(n) is true for all n,\nit cannot have a proof in PA which is shorter than\nf(n).\n\n\nThe Speed-up Theorem is the result of contemplating and elaborating\nthe proof of the incompleteness theorem. It applies the fixed-point\ntechnique to the concept of unprovability by a short proof, as opposed\nto the original idea of applying the fixed-point theorem to mere\nunprovability. The proof has very much the same flavor as the proof of\nthe incompleteness theorem. Interestingly, it dates from the same year\nas the construction, due to Rosser, that eliminates the use of\n\u03c9-consistency in the first Incompleteness Theorem; like the\nSpeed-up Theorem of G\u00f6del, Rosser\u2019s construction exploits\nthe issue of short and long proofs. G\u00f6del never submitted a proof\nfor the Speed-up Theorem. Over the years several related proofs were\npublished, but the first full proof of G\u00f6del\u2019s original\nresult was given only in 1994 by Sam Buss in his \u2018On\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorems on lengths of proofs I: Number of lines\nand speedups for arithmetic.\u2019 (Buss 1994). Buss also gives a\nsecond proof of the theorem which avoids self-reference, following a\ntechnique due to Statman. G\u00f6del measures the length of proofs by\nthe number of formulas; but there are also other possibilities, such\nas the number of symbols in the proof. The case of the Speed-up\nTheorem where the length of proof is measured by the number of symbols\nwas proved by Mostowski in 1952 (Mostowski 1982). For proofs of\nsimilar results see Ehrenfeucht and Mycieleski 1971, and Parikh 1971.\nThough both measures may be equally natural candidates for measuring\nthe length of a proof, proving the theorem for length measured by the\nnumber of symbols avoids a technical complication introduced by the\nother measure: there are only finitely many proofs with a given number\nof symbols, whereas there are infinitely many proofs with a given\nnumber of formulas.\n\nG\u00f6del states the Speed-up Theorem differently from the above. Let\nSn be the system of logic of the n-th\norder, the variables of the first level being thought of as ranging\nover natural numbers. In this setting, variables of the second level\nrange over sets of natural numbers and so on. G\u00f6del\u2019s\nformulation is:\n\n\nTheorem 6.\n\nLet n be a natural number > 0. If f is a\ncomputable function, then there are infinitely many formulas\nA, provable in Sn, such that if\nk is the length of the shortest proof of A in\nSn and l is the length of the\nshortest proof of A in Sn+1,\nthen k > f(l).\n\nProof sketch: The idea is the following: Let\n\u03c6(x) be a formula, like above, for which\n\u03c6(m) does not have a short proof in\nSn for any m. Suppose we have a\nhigher type system Sn+1 in which we can\nprove \u2200x\u03c6(x). This proof is of constant\nlength. Thus each \u03c6(m) is derivable from this universal\nstatement by one application of the logical rule\n\u2200x\u03c6(x) \u2192 \u03c6(t). Thus\n\u03c6(m) has in that system for all m a short\nproof.\n\n\nWhat kind of stronger system can we have in which\n\u2200x\u03c6(x) is provable? We may consider\nsecond order logic in which we can define a predicate\nN(x) for the set of natural numbers and furthermore\ncan prove of a new predicate symbol Tr(x) that it\nsatisfies the inductive clauses of the truth definition of first order\nformulas of arithmetic, relativized to N. Then the stronger\nsystem can prove that provable first order sentences of arithmetic\nsatisfy the predicate Tr . By the above argument, we can\nprove in the stronger system that \u2200x\u03c6(x)\nsatisfies Tr. Then by adding a few lines we can prove each\n\u03c6(n) satisfies Tr. Because of the nature of\n\u03c6(n), this implies the stronger system has a (short)\nproof of \u03c6(n). An alternative system is Peano\u2019s\naxioms PA in an extended language where we have a new predicate symbol\nTr and axioms stating that the predicate Tr codes\nthe satisfaction relation for all sentences of the vocabulary not\ncontaining Tr.\n",
