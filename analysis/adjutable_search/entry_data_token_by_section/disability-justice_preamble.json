    "main_text": "\n\nAmong the topics in philosophy and disability, the relationship\nbetween disability and justice has received the lion\u2019s share of\nattention. No doubt this is in part because justice, often regarded as\nthe \u201cfirst virtue of social institutions\u201d (Rawls 1971: 3),\nis central to the evaluation of social policies and public\ninstitutions. But it is also because disability has played at least\ntwo distinct roles in recent discussions of social justice. First,\ndisability has been seen by many as a paradigm example of unchosen\ndisadvantage. Hence, disability has played a central role in internal\ndiscussions of luck egalitarianism, in particular with respect to the\n\u201ccurrency\u201d question\u2014equality of what?\u2014and\nexternal discussions, in particular with respect to the question of\nwhether luck egalitarianism is disrespectful or stigmatizing. Second,\npeople with disabilities, particularly intellectual or cognitive\ndisabilities, have been seen by many as a \u201climit case\u201d for\ncontractarian or contractualist theories of justice. Hence, disability\nhas played a central role in discussions about the eligibility\nconditions for being party to the contractual procedures by which\nprinciples of justice are chosen and for being subject to the\nprinciples of justice so chosen.\n\nDisability also presents difficult issues as a social or group\nidentity: roughly, a central part of the way an individual\nunderstands, presents, or values herself. This aspect of disability\nhas been made salient by the civil rights movement that established\ndisability as an important category in antidiscrimination law.\nTheories that assess justice in terms of the distribution of resources\nor opportunities have sometimes been criticized for failing to take\nadequate account of such identities. But the embrace of social\nidentity as a component of justice can be equally problematic.\n\nDisability is of special interest for justice because of the way in\nwhich it juxtaposes two basic and powerful senses of\ninjustice. These two senses of injustice are sometimes\nexpressed in terms of a distinction between the justice of\ndistributions and the justice of recognition, or\nmore recently, between distributive justice and\nrelational injustice. Very roughly, we can think of these\nlabels as denoting a distinction between the injustice of certain\noutcomes\u2014in particular, outcomes in which there is an\ninequality of income, wealth, health, or other aspects of well-being\nresulting from morally irrelevant factors\u2014and the injustice of\ncertain forms of treatment\u2014in particular, the treatment\nof some people as moral, social, or political inferiors on\nthe basis of morally irrelevant characteristics. Correcting the first\nform of injustice is thought to require, fundamentally, a change in\nthe distribution of resources, broadly construed, that affect\nwell-being. Correcting the first form of injustice is thought to\nrequire, fundamentally, a change in the structure and character of\ninterpersonal relationships, which may in turn require changes to\nsocial and institutional norms and practices. Needless to say, the\nrelationship and comparative importance of these two forms of\ninjustice have been the subject of considerable discussion, and there\nis no canonical statement of the distinction (Fourie et al. 2015;\nAnderson 1999; Fraser 2001, 1996; Honneth 1992).\n\nThis entry is organized as follows: Section 1 will discuss disability\nin terms of these two broad types of injustice. Sections 2 and 3 will\nexamine the implications of different models of disability for the\ndistinction between redistribution and recognition. Section 4 will\nthen examine the treatment of disability in contemporary theories of\ndistributive justice. It will explain how the environmental and social\ncharacter of disability has been largely overlooked by contractarian\nand egalitarian theories, not so much because of their distributive\nfocus, but because of their narrow focus on one aspect of\ndisability\u2014functional limitation\u2014to the neglect of\nexclusionary attitudes and practices. Section 4 will conclude by\ndiscussing recent efforts to rectify this neglect, describing several\nways in which distributive justice theorists have sought to take\naccount of environmental and social barriers and to address claims for\nrecognition. These efforts include broadening the metric for just\ndistributions to encompass respectful relationships and social\npractices; arguing that a just distribution on such broader metrics\ncan be attained more effectively and appropriately by modifying the\nphysical and social environment than by redistributing resources among\nindividuals; and adopting outcome standards that do not require strict\nequality on any metric but rather the reduction or elimination of\ndisrespectful inequalities. Section 5 will discuss a major issue in\nthe recognition of disability: the relationship of disability identity\nto various approaches to justice, where \u201cidentity\u201d is\nunderstood as a part of an individual\u2019s self-understanding or\nself-presentation.\n",
