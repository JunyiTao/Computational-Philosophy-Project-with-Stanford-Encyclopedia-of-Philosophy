    "main_text": "Representations of Partial Belief || Ranking Theory\n3.4 Ranking Theory\n\nRanking theory (Spohn 1988, 1990 and especially 2012) assigns\nnumerical degrees of disbelief directly to possibilities in\n\\(W\\). A pointwise ranking function \\(\\kappa : W \\rightarrow\n\\bN\\cup \\{\\infty \\}\\) assigns a natural number (or \\(\\infty\\)) to each\npossible world in \\(W\\). These numbers represent the degree of\ndisbelief you assign to each possibility. Equipped with a pointwise\nranking function, we can generate a numbered partition of\n\\(W\\): \n\n\\[\n\\kappa^{-1}(0), \\kappa^{-1}(1),\n\\kappa^{-1}(2), \\ldots ,\\kappa^{-1}(\\infty).\n\\]\n\n\nThe cell \\(\\kappa^{-1}(\\infty)\\) is the set of possibilities which are\nmaximally disbelieved. The cell \\(\\kappa^{-1}(n)\\) is the set of\npossibilities which are disbelieved to degree \\(n\\). Finally,\n\\(\\kappa^{-1}(0)\\) contains the possibilities which are not\ndisbelieved (although this does not mean that they are believed).\nExcept for \\(\\kappa^{-1}(0)\\), the cells \\(\\kappa^{-1}(n)\\) may be\nempty. Since one cannot consistently disbelieve everything, the first\ncell must not be empty. \n\nA pointwise ranking function \\(\\kappa\\) induces a ranking\nfunction \\(\\varrho : \\mathbf{A} \\rightarrow \\bN\\cup \\{\\infty \\}\\)\non the field \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) by setting, \n\n\\[\n\\varrho(A) = \\min\\{\\kappa(w): w \\in A\\}, \n\\]\n\n\nfor each \\(A \\in \\mathbf{A}\\). In other words: a set of worlds is only\nas disbelieved as its most plausible member. By convention, we set\n\\(\\varrho(\\varnothing)=\\infty\\). This entails that ranking functions\nare (finitely) minimitive and hence super-additive. In other\nwords, for all \\(A, B\\) in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), \n\n\\[\n\\varrho(A\\cup B) = \\min\\{\\varrho(A), \\varrho(B)\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nAlternatively, we can characterize ranking functions as those\nfunctions \\(\\varrho: \\mathbf{A}\\rightarrow \\mathbf{N}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}\\)\nsatisfying  \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\varrho(W) &= 0;  \\\\\n\\varrho(\\varnothing) &= \\infty; \\\\\n\\varrho(A\\cup B) &= \\min \\{\\varrho(A), \\varrho(B)\\},\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nfor all \\(A,B\\in \\mathbf{A}.\\) The first axiom says that no agent\nshould disbelieve the tautological proposition \\(W\\). The second says\nthat every agent should maximally disbelieve the contradictory\nprosition. Intuitively, the final axiom says that a disjunction \\(A\n\\cup B\\) should be disbelieved just in case both disjuncts are\ndisbelieved. However, the meaning of the final axiom is not exhausted\nby this gloss (see Section 4.1 in Huber, 2020).\n\nAs stated above, the third axiom is called finite\nminimitivity. Just as in probability theory, it can be\nstrengthened to countable unions, resulting in countably\nminimitive ranking functions. Unlike probability theory, finite\nminimitivity can also be strenghtened to arbitrary unions, resulting\nin completely minimitive ranking functions. See Huber (2006)\nfor conditions under which a ranking function defined on a field of\npropositions induces a pointwise ranking functions on the underlying\nset of possibilities.\n\nThe number \\(\\varrho(A)\\) represents the agent\u2019s degree of\ndisbelief in the proposition \\(A\\). If \\(\\varrho(A) \\gt 0\\), the agent\ndisbelieves \\(A\\) to a positive degree. Therefore, on pain of\ninconsistency, she cannot also disbelieve \\(\\neg A\\) to a positive\ndegree. In other words, for every proposition \\(A\\) in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\),\nat least one of \\(A, \\neg A\\) has to be assigned rank 0. If\n\\(\\varrho(A) = 0\\), the agent does not disbelieve \\(A\\) to a positive\ndegree. However, this does not mean that she believes \\(A\\) to a\npositive degree \\(-\\) the agent may suspend judgment and assign rank 0\nto both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\). So belief in a proposition is\ncharacterized by disbelief in its negation.\n\nFor each ranking function \\(\\varrho\\) we can define a corresponding\nbelief function \\(\\beta : \\mathbf{A} \\rightarrow\n\\mathbf{Z}\\cup \\{\\pm \\infty \\}\\) by setting \\( \\beta(A) = \\varrho(\\neg\nA) - \\varrho(A) \\) for all \\(A\\) in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). The belief\nfunction assigns positive numbers to those propositions that are\nbelieved, negative numbers to those propositions that are disbelieved,\nand 0 to those propositions with respect to which the agent suspends\njudgment. Each ranking function \\(\\varrho\\) induces a belief\nset \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\bB &= \\{A \\in \\mathbf{A}: \\beta(A) \\gt 0\\} \\\\\n &= \\{A \\in \\mathbf{A}: \\varrho(\\neg A) \\gt \\varrho(A)\\} \\\\\n &=\\{A \\in \\mathbf{A}: \\varrho(\\neg A) \\gt 0\\}.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\\(\\bB\\) is the set of all propositions the agent believes to some\npositive degree, or equivalently, whose complements she disbelieves to\na positive degree. The belief set \\(\\bB\\) induced by a\n(finitely/countable/completely minimitive) ranking function\n\\(\\varrho\\) is consistent and deductively closed (in the\nfinite/countably/complete sense). Since any proposition with\n\\(\\beta(A)>0\\) is believed, ranking theory can be seen as satisfying\nthe Lockean thesis (see\n Section 4.2.2)\n without sacrificing deductive closure. Note, however, that we could\nhave defined \\(\\bB\\) to include all those propositions \\(A\\) with\n\\(\\beta(A) \\gt t\\) for some threshold \\(t\\) greater than zero. See\nRaidl (2019) for an exploration of these possibilities. \n\nSo far we have discussed the synchronic structure ranking theory\nimposes on belief. How should ranks be updated when new information is\nreceived? The conditional ranking function\n\\(\\varrho(\\cdot\\mid \\cdot):\\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{A} \\rightarrow\n\\bN\\cup \\{\\infty \\} \\) based on the non-conditional ranking function\n\\(\\varrho\\) is defined by setting  \n\n\\[\n\\varrho(A\\mid B) = \\varrho(A \\cap B) - \\varrho(B),\n\\]\n\n\nfor all \\(A, B\\) in \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) where \\(A \\neq \\varnothing\\). We\nadopt the convention that \\(\\infty - \\infty = 0\\) and \\(\\infty - n =\n\\infty\\) for all finite \\(n\\). Note that this entails that\n\\(\\varrho(\\neg A\\mid A) = \\infty\\). Requiring that\n\\(\\varrho(\\varnothing \\mid B) = \\infty\\) for all \\(B\\) in\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\) guarantees that \\(\\varrho(\\cdot\\mid B)\\) is a\n(non-conditional) ranking function. Conditional ranking functions give\nrise to a ranking-theoretic counterpart of strict\nconditionalization:\n\nPlain Conditionalization.\n\nSuppose that \\(\\varrho(\\cdot)\\) is your ranking function at time \\(t\\)\nand that \\(\\varrho(A),\\varrho(\\neg A) \\lt \\infty\\). Furthermore,\nsuppose that between \\(t\\) and \\(t^\\prime\\) you become certain of\n\\(A\\) and no logically stronger proposition. Then, your ranking\nfunction at time \\(t^\\prime\\) should be \\(\\varrho(\\cdot\\mid A)\\). \n\nNote that all the considerations relevant to the interpretation of\nBayesian conditionalization (discussed in\n Section 3.1.4)\n apply equally to ranking-theoretic conditioning. It is clear from the\ndefinition of conditioning that, as in the Bayesian case, the rank of\nthe material conditional is a lower bound for the conditional rank:\n\\(\\beta(A\\rightarrow B)\\leq \\beta(B|A)\\). That ensures that\nranking-theoretic update satisfies Conditionalization ( see\n Section 2.1.1).\n It also satisfies a version of Rational Monotony: if \\(\\beta(\\neg\nA)=0\\) and \\(\\beta(B)>0,\\) then \\(\\beta(B|A)>0.\\) Therefore,\nranking-theoretic update satisfies the \u201cspirit\u201d of AGM\nupdate. Note, however, that ranking theory has no trouble with\niterated belief revision: a revision takes as input a ranking function\nand an evidential proposition and outputs a new ranking function.\nMoreveover, the situation changes if the threshold for belief is\nraised to some positive number greater than zero: in that case,\nRational Monotony may no longer be satisfied (see Raidl, 2019). \n\nPlain conditionalization only covers the case when new evidence\nacquires the maximum degree of certainty. Spohn (1988) also defines a\nranking-theoretic analogue to Jeffrey conditionalization. In this\ncase, new evidence does not acquire maximum certainty, but merely\nchanges your ranks for various propositions. For more on\nranking-theoretic notions of belief update see Huber (2014, 2019). For\na comparison of probability theory and ranking theory see Spohn (2009,\nSection 3) \n\nWhy should grades of disbelief obey the ranking calculus? And why\nshould ranking functions be updated according to ranking-theoretic\nconditionalization? Recall that in the case of subjective probability\ntheory, analogous questions were answered by appeal either to the\nDutch book arguments or considerations of epistemic accuracy. Is it\npossible to make similar arguments in favor of ranking theory?\n\nThe short answer is yes: Huber (2007 and 2020, Chapter 5) proves that\nobeying the normative constraints of the ranking calculus is a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for maintaining consistency and\ndeductive closure, both synchronically and in the face of new\nevidence. The latter end is, in turn, a necessary, but insufficient\nmeans to attaining the end of always having only true beliefs, and as\nmany thereof as possible. Unlike the Dutch book arguments, this result\nrequires no appeal to pragmatic considerations about betting behavior.\nBr\u00f6ssel, Eder & Huber (2013) discuss the importance of this\nresult as well as its Bayesian role-model, Joyce\u2019s (1998, 2009)\n\u201cnon-pragmatic\u201d vindication of probabilism.\n\nIt is fairly straightforward to see that any agent that obeys the\nsynchronic requirements of the ranking calculus (and updates according\nto one of the sactioned update rules) will maintain beliefs that are\nmutually consistent and deductively closed, no matter what new\nevidence arrives. What is slightly more puzzling is why any agent who\ndoes not validate the ranking calculus must either have\ninconsistent beliefs, or fail to believe a logical consequence of some\nof her beliefs. In other words: it is clear that the ranking calculus\nis sufficient for deductive cogency, but why is it\nnecessary?\n\nTo sketch the necessity argument, we must introduce a bit of\nterminology. An agent\u2019s degree of entrenchment for a\nproposition \\(A\\) is the number of \u201cindependent and minimally\npositively reliable\u201d (mp-reliable) information sources saying\n\\(A\\) that it would take for the agent to give up her disbelief that\n\\(A\\). If the agent does not disbelieve \\(A\\) to begin with, her\ndegree of entrenchment for \\(A\\) is 0. If no finite number of\ninformation sources is able to make the agent give up her disbelief\nthat \\(A\\), her degree of entrenchment for \\(A\\) is \\(\\infty\\). Of\ncourse, information sources we typically encounter are rarely\nindependent or mp-reliable. However, this is not crucial. Independent,\nmp-reliable sources are a theoretical construct \u2013 the connection\nbetween entrenchment and update is stated as a counterfactual because\nthe agent need never actually encounter such information sources.\n\nThe necessity argument proceeds by stipulating that entrenchment is\nreflected in degrees of disbelief. This connects an agent\u2019s\nupdating behavior with her ranks for various propositions.\nRecall that Bayesians stipulate a similar connection between degrees\nof belief and acceptable betting ratios. Equipped with this\nconnection, Huber (2007, 2020) proves that if an agent fails to\nvalidate the ranking calculus then, were she to encounter independent,\nmp-reliable information sources of various kinds, her beliefs would\nfail to be deductively cogent. That completes the necessity\nargument.\n\nWith the possible exception of decision making (see however Giang and\nShenoy, 2000 as well as Spohn 2017a, 2020), it seems that we can do\neverything with ranking functions that we can do with probability\nmeasures. Ranking theory also naturally gives rise to a notion of\nqualitative belief that incurs no Lottery-style paradoxes (see\n Section 4.2.2).\n This may be vital if we want to stay in tune with traditional\nepistemology. The treatment of ranking theory in this article has\nbeen, of necessity, rather compressed. For an excellent article-length\nintroduction see Huber (2019). For an accessible book, see Huber\n(2020). For an extensive book-length treatment, with applications to\nmany subjects in epistemology and philosophy of science, see Spohn\n(2012).\n",
