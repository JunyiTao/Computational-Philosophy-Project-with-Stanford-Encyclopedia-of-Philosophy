    "main_text": "Varieties of Pacifism || Universal vs. Particular Pacifism\n2.3 Universal vs. Particular Pacifism\n\nThis distinction has to do with the issue of whether everyone is\nrequired to be a pacifist or whether pacifism can be a moral choice of\nsome particular individuals. This is related to the question of\nwhether pacifism is a duty for all or whether it supererogatory. While\nthe distinction between universal and particular pacifism is related\nto the distinction between absolute and contingent pacifism, it is\nprimarily focused on the question of who is obligated by\npacifism. Universalism in thinking about pacifism will hold that if\nwar is wrong, it is wrong for everyone and thus that soldiers who\nfight are wrong, as are those who support the war system that\nencourages them to fight. Particular pacifists articulate their\nposition as merely personal and do not condemn the war system or\nsoldiers who choose to fight. Universal pacifism is closely connected\nwith absolute and maximal versions of pacifism; particular pacifism is\nrelated to contingent and minimal pacifisms.\n\nOne way that this distinction between universal and particular\npacifism has been enacted in history is through the idea of vocational\npacifism discussed above Vocational pacifism holds that pacifism is a\nspecial obligation of a particular vocational service; but that it is\nnot required of all. In this sense, pacifism is a supererogatory\nobligation. Religious clerics may thus be required to renounce\nviolence, while ordinary members of their congregations may not be so\nobliged. Particular pacifism is thus connected to contingent pacifism:\nthe moral demand of pacifism may be contingent upon one\u2019s social\nposition.\n\nThis distinction can be understood by considering whether pacifism is\nmorally necessary or whether it is merely morally permitted. The\nuniversalist answer to this question is: if war and violence are\nwrong, then pacifism is morally necessary and those who fight are\nwrong. But some pacifist appear to hold that it is not wrong\nto fight (or that some persons are permitted to fight), even\nthough the pacifists herself may choose (or is obliged by some\nvocational commitment) not to fight. A conscientious objector may thus\nchoose not to fight while not condemning those who do. Conscientious\nrefusal may be articulated as a personal belief about pacifism that\ndoes not apply to others. This is one way pacifists who refuse to\nfight may avoid the charge that they are traitors who are opposed to\ntheir compatriots who fight: they may deny that their refusal has any\nuniversal moral significance or application. Eric Reitan has argued\nthat one may adopt a sort of \u201cpersonal pacifism\u201d that need\nnot be universally applied. One way of understanding this is to\nconnect it with the idea of tolerance. A personal pacifist may believe\nthat pacifism is the right choice; but she may choose to tolerate\nothers who do not make the same choice. A personal pacifist may also\nespouse a sort of relativism that holds that a commitment to pacifism\nis merely a personal commitment that cannot be used to condemn others\nwho make different commitments.\n\nThis idea of particular pacifism is a subtle one. And critics will\nargue that it is incoherent, especially if it is understood as a sort\nof relativism. Those who claim that conscientious objectors are\ntraitors may argue that pacifism cannot be a particular or personal\nchoice. Critics of pacifism will argue that pacifism is morally wrong\nbecause they think that patriotism or justice requires fighting or at\nleast supporting the war effort. This objection would hold that if a\nwar is justified, then conscientious objectors are wrong to reject it.\nParticularists may reply by claiming that their rejection of war is a\npersonal choice without universal significance.\n",
