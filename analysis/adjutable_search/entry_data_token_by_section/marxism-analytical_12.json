John Roemer has developed,\nand serially refined, a particular variant referred to here as\n\u201ccoupon socialism\u201d (1994a, 1994b, 1996). Coupon socialism\nis an example of a kind of market socialism sometimes called\n\u201cshareholder socialism\u201d; that is, a type of economic model\nwhich combines a stock market with public ownership of firms (Corneo\n2017: 184\u2013197). Sceptics might characterise the result as\n\u201ccapitalism without capitalists\u201d, but Roemer defends it as\na feasible and desirable attempt to combine: efficient market\nmechanisms; some state planning over broad investment priorities; an\negalitarian distribution of property rights; and an egalitarian\ndistribution of profits.\n\nRoemer is keen not to rerun earlier battles between socialism and the\nmarket. Socialists, he insists, cannot afford to neglect the\nimportance of efficiency and innovation in generating sustainable\nprosperity. He variously: allows that Soviet-style command economies\nfailed; presents Friedrich Hayek as winning the \u201csocialist\ncalculation debate\u201d; and recommends learning from the real-world\ninstitutional \u201cexperiments\u201d of contemporary capitalisms\n(where ownership and control are already differentiated, and diverse\nmechanisms\u2014involving figurative \u201ccarrots\u201d and\n\u201csticks\u201d\u2014have been developed to tackle\nprincipal-agent problems). A strong public sector is likely to be a\ncentral ingredient of a socialist society, but socialists are\nadmonished to stop \u201cfetishizing\u201d public ownership, and to\nbe open-minded about possible ownership relations, judging them only\nby their effects on equality and efficiency (Roemer 1994b:\n454\u2013457). Roemer\u2019s own earlier work on exploitation had\nconvinced him that property relations and asset inequalities\u2014not\nmarkets as such\u2014are the real problems.\n\nCoupon socialism aims to distribute the profits of firms equally\namongst citizens without unacceptable losses in efficiency compared to\ncontemporary capitalism. The model eliminates capitalist class\nrelations whilst retaining market mechanisms. Ownership is distributed\nequally through arrangements which involve a stock market and\ndecentralised decision making. Its most striking institutional feature\nis perhaps the creation of two kinds of money\u2014call them\n\u201cdollars\u201d and \u201ccoupons\u201d\u2014which are not\nconvertible by individuals (who cannot legally exchange coupons for\ndollars or transfer coupons as gifts or bequests). Dollars are used to\nbuy all the commodities that you might currently purchase (including\nlabour power and consumption goods) except that they cannot be used to\nbuy ownership rights in listed companies. The latter can only be\npurchased by individuals with coupons, and coupons are distributed to\nindividuals in an egalitarian manner. The shares are priced in coupons\nbut any subsequent dividend would be in dollars. At the legal age of\nmaturity, individuals receive their per capita share of the\ntotal coupon value of the economy. It is assumed that most individuals\nwill invest their coupons in shares through mutual funds rather than\ndirectly. A share of a firm entitles the mutual fund to a share of the\nrelevant firm\u2019s profits, and a share of a mutual fund entitles\nthe individual to a share in the fund\u2019s revenues (Roemer 1996:\n20). The model effectively endows citizens at adulthood with a modest\nincome stream during their lives, generated from the profits of public\ncompanies that are not directly owned by the state. The various\nrestrictions on the relevant property rights ensure that the scope for\naccumulating wealth in means of production is limited. Differentials\nin coupon wealth would exist, but the main causes of inequality would\nbe differential wages and savings behaviour.\n\nSuch a brief sketch of coupon socialism raises many questions (see\nWright 1995, and Veneziani 2021, for further discussion). These\ninclude questions about its feasibility and desirability.\n\nFeasibility worries often concern the economic details of the model.\nCritics wonder variously about: the place of small private capitalist\nfirms (shops, restaurants, small manufacturers); the modesty of the\ncoupon-driven income stream; and the structures needed for raising\ninvestment funds (through credit markets and other mechanisms which\nallow companies to convert coupons into dollars subject to regulation)\n(Corneo 2017: 184\u2013197).\n\nDesirability worries often concern the socialist credentials of the\nmodel. Critics wonder variously about: the extent to which these\ninstitutional arrangements might embody and promote an individualism\ncorrosive of community; or how far these arrangements might fail to\nembody and promote the kind of control over work arrangements that\nsocialists have historically endorsed and sought to realise (Wright\n1995).\n\nMore generally, much seems to depends on the intended aim of the\nmodel. Should we think of coupon socialism as: an imaginative\ntheoretical demonstration that economic efficiency can be\nconceptualised outside of capitalist private ownership; a deliberately\nmodest and accessible first step away from capitalist society towards\na more egalitarian future; or as the very best socialist arrangements\nthat are feasible? (These alternatives are not intended to be\nexhaustive.)\n\nRoemer has continued to work on issues of socialist design, focussing\nmore recently on the modelling of individual economic behaviour\n(Roemer 2019a). Any coherent socio-economic system, he suggests,\nrequires \u201cthree pillars\u201d: a set of property relations and\ninstitutions that organise the allocation of resources; a distributive\nethic that identifies a fair or just pattern of income and resources;\nand a behavioural ethos that specifies how economic actors make\ndecisions. These three should work together, in that if economic\nagents act according to the relevant ethos, then the relevant\ninstitutional arrangements should implement the relevant just\ndistribution. Roemer now insists that the behavioural ethos is as\nimportant as the other two pillars, and criticises earlier models of\nmarket socialism\u2014including coupon socialism\u2014for having\nchanged the institutional arrangements of capitalism but kept its\nbehavioural ethos (Roemer 2019a: 179; see Carens 1981 for a possible\nexception).\n\nIn capitalism, the behavioural ethos is said to be\n\u201cindividualism\u201d (the individual \u201cgoes it\nalone\u201d), where each actor is conceived as \u201cbeing in\ncompetition with all other actors, and the actions of all are\nconstrained by nature\u201d. In socialism, in contrast, the\nbehavioural ethos is cooperation, where citizens of a socialist\nsociety are engaged in a cooperative enterprise to transform nature in\norder to improve the lives of everyone (Roemer 2020a:\n10\u201311).\n\nMore precisely, Roemer recommends a socialist model of cooperation\nthat he calls \u201cKantian optimisation\u201d. Kantian optimisation\nchallenges both the standard economic picture of individuals as\nutility maximisers, and in the standard ways in which that standard\npicture is adjusted for other-regarding motivations (Roemer rejects\nthe idea that Nash optimisation is the uniquely rational way to\noptimise). In Kantian optimisation, individuals choose the action that\nmaximises their payoff, assuming that all other agents take the same\naction. Very roughly, cooperation depends, not on altruism (which is\nimplausibly demanding), but on solidarity (the idea that we are\n\u201call in the same boat\u201d) and trust (the idea that if we\ntake the cooperative action, enough others will do so as well). This\nsocialist model of cooperation is said to be realistic, in that it\nrespects certain behavioural results in both the laboratory and real\nlife (recycling and tipping, for instance (Roemer 2019a:\n14\u201316)).\n\nRoemer uses formal models\u2014general competitive equilibrium and\ngame theory\u2014to demonstrate some surprising payoffs for socialist\ndesign once this model of cooperation is integrated into it. Not\nleast, he demonstrates that, under some fairly uncontroversial\nassumptions, market socialist economies can rectify the unequal income\ndistribution of capitalism without paying a price in efficiency or\nmarket failures (Roemer 2019a: 206\u2013207, and Veneziani 2021). In\nshort, given Kantian optimisation, certain familiar problems in\nsocialist design may be less serious than were once thought (Roemer\n2015: 107).\n",
