    "main_text": "Faith, Reason, and Myth\n2. Faith, Reason, and Myth\n\n\nTwo features that are new in Judah\u2019s work and, thus, serve to\ndifferentiate his thought from that of his Jewish and Islamic\npredecessors are: (1) his almost complete lack of concern with the\nvenerable antagonism between faith and reason, and (2) his interest in\nelucidating the concomitant intersection between Greek myth and\nJudaism.\n\n\nThe tension between faith and reason had been at the heart of\nmedieval Jewish philosophy. This became especially pronounced in\npost-Maimonidean philosophy, which witnessed the radicalization of a\nnumber of principles (e.g., eternality of the universe, denial of\nbodily resurrection), and which threatened to undermine traditional\nreligious belief. This led to a Kulturkampf between\nthose who thought that non-Jewish learning (i.e., philosophy) had a\nvalid role to play in the Jewish curriculum versus those who claimed\nthat such \u201cforeign\u201d works led to apostasy. The\nreverberations of these conflicts, known collectively as the\n\u201cMaimonidean controversies,\u201d were severe.\n\n\nThe antagonism between faith and reason is immediately palpable in\nthe thought of Judah\u2019s father, who constantly tried to uphold\ntraditional Jewish belief against what he considered to be the\nonslaught of philosophical radicalism. Yet, in the thought of\nJudah this \u201cconflict\u201d between the hitherto venerable\nantagonists virtually disappears. The question we have to ask,\nthen, is why?  The most likely reason is to be located in the\nnotion of sophia perennis, which played an important role in\nthe thought of Florentine humanists. According to this doctrine,\nthere exists a unity to all knowledge irrespective of its source. \nAs a result, the rationalism of philosophy could quite easily be\nreconciled with that of revelation because both were regarded as\narticulating the same truth. Evidence of this may be seen in\nJudah\u2019s frequent citation of biblical passages to support\nphilosophical principles and vice versa. Furthermore, because\nJudah is primarily unconcerned with the antagonism between faith and\nreason, he becomes one of the first Jewish philosophers to ignore\nesotericism (viz., that philosophical truths must be kept from\nthe unenlightened) as a philosophical principle. For him,\ntraditional esoteric topics, such as metaphysics, now become part and\nparcel of the beautiful and dramatic unfolding of God\u2019s beauty in\nthe universe, and such topics are open to all (including women, as the\ncharacter of Sophia demonstrates).\n\n\nFurther evidence of Judah\u2019s use of the concept of sophia\nperennis may be witnessed in his orientation towards ancient Greek\nmyth. The \u201crediscovery\u201d of ancient Greek and Roman\nliterature was one of the hallmarks of the Renaissance, and in the\nthought of Judah we certainly see this, only now with a distinctly\nJewish \u201ctwist.\u201d On one level, he wants to show that there\nexists a fundamental identity between Greek myth and the teachings of\nthe Torah. Yet, on a deeper level he wants to argue that the\nGreeks ultimately derived their teachings from the ancient Israelites\nand subsequently corrupted\n them.[15]\n For instance, Judah argues that Plato studied among\nthe ancient Israelites in\n Egypt,[16]\n and that Plato\u2019s myth of the Androgyne, found\nin the Symposium, is actually a Greek plagiarism of a Jewish\nsource:\n\n\n\nSophia: The story is beautiful and ornate (la favola \u00e8\nbella e ornata), and it is impossible not to believe that it\nsignifies some philosophical beauty (bella filosofia), more\nespecially since it was composed by Plato himself, in the\nSymposium, in the name of Aristophanes. Tell me,\ntherefore, Philo what is the allegory?\n\n\nPhilo: The myth was handed down by earlier writers than the\nGreeks\u2014in the sacred writings of Moses, concerning the creation\nof the first human parents, Adam and Eve\u2026it was from [Moses]\nthat Plato took his myth, amplifying and polishing it after Greek\noratory, thus giving a confused account of Hebrew matters (facendo\nin questo una mescolanza inordinate de le cose\nebraiche).[17]\n\n\n\nJudah seeks to accomplish at least two things with passages such as\nthis. First, he claims, polemically, that the Jewish tradition,\nespecially its mythopoeic tradition, is the source of all subsequent\nliterary and philosophical streams of western civilization.  Secondly\n(and this is less evident in the above passage than in other ones), he\ntries to wrest Christian-centric interpretations of biblical passages\n(e.g., the Garden of Eden and the concept of original sin), including\nthose offered by thinkers such as Ficino and Pico della\n Mirandola,[18]\n away \nfrom what he considers to be the original intentionality of the\ntext. Rather, he claims that the Jewish version or interpretation of\nsuch texts is actually more in keeping with the spirit of the\nRenaissance than those offered by Christians. The corollary of this is\nthat any individual, Jewish or Gentile, should quite easily be able to\naccept equally the truths of Judaism and those of\n philosophy.[19]\n",
