    "main_text": "Key Domains Addressed by Social Ontology || The Law\n5.8 Language and Linguistic Objects\n\nMuch work in linguistics and the philosophy of language involves\nclaims and assumptions about the nature of linguistic entities, such\nas linguistic rules, components of the language faculty, and semantic\ncontent. Theories of the nature of language and meaning are also\ninfluential models for the metaphysics of other social entities (such\nas artifacts, institutions, and laws).\n\nThe most conspicuous debate about the \u201cnature of\nlanguage\u201d\u2014namely, the debate over innateness\u2014does\nnot have much to do with the metaphysics of language. Like most\nphenomena involving the human mind, language is causally affected by\nsocial factors. A person\u2019s vocabulary and grammar, for instance,\nare affected by interactions with parents, peers, and other community\nmembers. Just how significant these causal effects are is widely\ndebated in linguistics, with many in the Chomskian tradition favoring\ninnate constraints on the mental structures of language and others\nrejecting innatism (see Chomsky 1986, 2000; Tomasello 1992, 1995;\nElman, Bates et al. 1996; Kirby 1999). The question of the nature of\nlanguage, however, is to a large extent independent of innatism versus\nanti-innatism. Interactions with other people may contribute only a\nbit to an individual\u2019s mental structures, or they may\nfundamentally shape them\u2014but in either case a person\u2019s\nlanguage may or may not ontologically depend only on that\nperson\u2019s brain states.\n\nChomsky (1986) does take an explicit position on the nature of\nlanguage and its ontological building blocks. He argues that\nlinguistics is the science of \u201cI-languages\u201d\u2014i.e.,\ninternalized languages, the mental rules of grammar, phonology, and so\non, that individuals use in expressing themselves or understanding the\nutterances of others. He rejects\n\u201cE-languages\u201d\u2014externalized or public languages like\nEnglish, Chinese, and Khosa\u2014as unscientific fictions. Others\ndisagree on various grounds. Katz and Postal (1991) share\nChomsky\u2019s view that each person has his or her own language, but\nargue that languages are abstract or mathematical entities rather than\npsychological ones (see also Higginbotham 1991). Wittgenstein (1953)\nand his successors have a more substantive disagreement: Wittgenstein\ndenies the possibility of a \u201cprivate language\u201d altogether,\narguing that language is a matter of engagement of people with one\nanother and with the world. Other philosophers have argued for the\npublicity and externality of language on a variety of grounds,\nincluding the communicative basis of language, the nature of rules,\nand theories of semantic content (see Kripke 1972, 1982; Schiffer\n1972; Lewis 1975; Putnam 1975; Burge 1979; Brandom 1994; Dummett 1989;\nand entries on\n theories of meaning,\n externalism about mental content,\n names,\n and\n the normativity of meaning and content).\n\nTheories of words, phonemes, and other linguistic entities are tied to\nthe metaphysics of language more generally, but also are subjects of\nseparate inquiries. The extent to which these are questions for social\nontology, rather than, say, the metaphysics of psychological states,\ndepends in part on whether and how language is public. Kaplan (1990),\nfor instance, argues that words are entities extended over time and\nacross a population: \u201cutterances and inscriptions are\nstages of words, which are the continuants made up\nof these interpersonal stages\u201d. This approach is in contrast to\ntype-token theories, some of which regard word-types to be socially\nindividuated, and others individualistically individuated (see Hugly\n& Sayward 1981, Bromberger 1989, McCulloch 1991, Cappelen 1999,\nWetzel 2009, Hawthorne & Lepore 2011). The nature of words is also\ntied to the question of whether a word\u2019s meaning is essential to\nit (Kaplan 1990, Alward 2005, Simchen 2012), and to the distinctions\nbetween various types of words in linguistics, such as phonological\nwords, syntactic atoms, morphological words, and lexical words (see\nSelkirk 1984, Di Sciullo & Williams 1987, Hall 1999, Raffelsiefen\n1999, Julien 2007). Similar issues arise in connection with sentences,\nutterances, and quotation (Davidson 1979, J. Bennett 1988, Washington\n1992, Cappelen & Lepore 1997, Recanati 2001,\nGarc\u00eda-Carpintero 2004b, Predelli 2008, Saka 2013).\n\nSpeech acts make up another domain in which social factors are\nplausibly constitutive. Austin (1962) and Searle (1969) argue that the\nforce of any speech act is a product of a social convention pertaining\nto speech acts of that type. Others use an\n\u201cintentionalist\u201d approach, in which the force of a speech\nact is a product only of the intentions of the speaker. Yet others\nargue that this force is a product of the uptake by hearers in\naddition to speaker intentions (see Strawson 1964, Bach & Harnish\n1979, Clark & Carlson 1982, Garc\u00eda-Carpintero 2004a, and entries on\n speech acts,\n assertion).\n",
