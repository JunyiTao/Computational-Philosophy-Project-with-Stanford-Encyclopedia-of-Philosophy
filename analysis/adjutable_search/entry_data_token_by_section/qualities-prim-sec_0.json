    "main_text": "Ancient Antecedents\n1. Ancient Antecedents\n\nIt is not uncommon for historians to say seventeenth century advocates\nof the distinction of P/SQs take it from the ancient Greek atomists,\nLeucippus and Democritus. Evidence of this comes from fragments of\nDemocritus\u2019 works, such as:\n\n\nBy convention sweet and by convention bitter, by convention hot, by\nconvention cold, by convention colours; but in reality atoms and void.\n(Taylor 1999: 9)\n\n\nC. C. W. Taylor (1999: 175\u20139) is among scholars who hold that\nthis corresponds to the modern distinction of P/SQs, but the\nattribution is problematic. It is true, that the properties of atoms\nare sharply divided from things that are by convention, including some\nSQs, but the problem is that the range of things by convention is\nunspecified in the fragments. Other scholars cite ancient testimony to\nthe effect that it is meant to include everything apprehended by sense\nperception (Lee 2011: 21\u20138; Pasnau 2007). If so, the ancient\ndistinction does not map onto a division between SQs and PQs that are\nsensible. Because the textual context of the fragments is now unknown\nand ancient testimony about it is conflicting, a definitive\ninterpretation is unlikely (Pasnau 2007).\n\nThe Atomists\u2019 theory is, however, in the spirit of an important\nstrain of the seventeenth century division of qualities. The ancients\nhold that reality is grasped solely by intellect. They accept two of\nParmenides\u2019 intelligibility constraints on change\u2014that one\nthing cannot come from many things and many cannot come from one; they\naim to construct a metaphysical system in which change under these\nconstraints is possible and the experience of non-conforming change is\nexplained (Taylor 1999: 160\u20134). Anaxagoras and Empedocles share\na strategy for explaining a sort of change under these constraints:\nbasic things, conceived either as the four elements or as stuffs and\nqualities, do not begin or cease to exist strictly speaking; but\nstates or relations of substances, conceived as either mixtures or\nseparations, have a qualified, or relative, being. Leucippus and\nDemocritus take a somewhat similar line: atoms moving in the void\nalways exist; they are indivisible, and never fuse along a common\nboundary, but bitter, sweet and the like are aggregates of atoms that\ncome to be by convention, or relatively (Taylor 1999: 160\u2013175).\nAtoms and the void are an a priori solution to a problem of\nintelligibility. Some later advocates of the P/SQ distinction, e.g.,\nGalileo and Descartes, hold that intellect provides a priori\nknowledge of the essences of things. But although variants of the\nlater distinction offer to explain the potentiality inherent in matter\nand the means by which change is regulated, the issues are not\npresented as a Parmenidian challenge to intelligibility. The target is\nrather the Aristotelian view that matter is potentiality and the\nbifurcated theory of accidental and substantial change. The influence\nof Parmenides on metaphysics in the modern era is complex, but\nadvocates of the doctrine of P/SQs as a group show little of it beyond\nadherence to ex nihilo nihil fit. Although atomism is\nprevalent in the early seventeenth century, it is often coupled with\nthe Aristotelian theory of elements (Kargon 1964). LoLordo (2011)\nargues that Gassendi\u2019s adaptation of Epicurean atomism makes no\ndistinction between PQs and SQs.\n",
