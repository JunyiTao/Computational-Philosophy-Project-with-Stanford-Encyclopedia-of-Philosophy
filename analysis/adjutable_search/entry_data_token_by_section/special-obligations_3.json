Special Obligations and Voluntarism\n\nNow we can consider how the consequentialist, or anyone who claims\nthat special obligations are not genuinely special but only\nderivatively so, can turn the burden of proof back upon the defender\nof special obligations. The following discussion borrows from Samuel\nScheffler\u2019s (1994) exposition of what he calls the voluntarist\nand the distributive objections to any claim that persons have\nnon-derivative special obligations. First, the voluntarist objection\narises when we consider the perspective of the person supposed to have\nspecial obligations over and above natural duties. Why suppose that I\nacquire additional moral obligations simply by, for example, being a\nmember of some group or standing in some relationship to another? Why\nsuppose that I am obliged to sacrifice more for another person simply\nbecause that person is my intimate or colleague or fellow citizen?\n\nUnlike natural duties, special obligations are grounded on something\nother than (or, in addition to) the intrinsic nature of the obligee.\nThe voluntarist worries support the view that special obligations can\nonly be acquired through the voluntary actions of the agent whose\nobligations they\n are.[3]\n (It is important to recognize that voluntarism is a thesis about\nspecial obligations alone. The question being pressed by the\nvoluntarist concerns obligations over and above those owed to all\npersons in virtue of their intrinsic nature or those that we have to\npromote intrinsically valuable states of affairs.) Thus, the\nvoluntarist will grant that special obligations are acquired through\npromises and contracts, because, in making a promise or contract, the\nagent voluntarily agrees to bear a certain burden for the person to\nwhom she makes the promise or contract. But other sorts of purported\nspecial obligations, in particular those owed to family members or to\nfellow citizens, would not be acquired through the voluntary actions\nof the obligor: one does not choose to be born into a certain family\nor as a citizen of a given country, so why suppose that, simply as a\nresult of luck, either good or bad, I have obligations, over and above\nmy natural duties or my consequentialist duties, to my family members\nand to my fellow citizens?\n\nThose who accept the voluntarist thesis concerning special obligations\ntake one of several approaches, including the following: (i) they\nlimit special obligations to the straightforwardly contractual or\npromissory, (ii) they attempt to show that all of the special\nobligations that they defend really are contractual or promissory in\nnature, or (iii) they show that while not all special obligations are\ncontractual, they nevertheless are similar in a relevant respect.\n\nLet us begin with option (i). According to this option, in addition to\nwhatever natural duties we have, we have only those further\nobligations that we have acquired through explicit promises or\ncontracts. The difficulty with this option is that it does little to\naccommodate the range of special obligations acknowledged by\ncommonsense morality. For example, most of us do not make the sorts of\npromises that we make to spouses to all of our friends. I have never\nexplicitly promised my best friend to love and care for her. This\ndifficulty is even more apparent in the case of familial\nrelationships. We do not enter into contracts with our parents of the\nform: take care of me as a child and I will reciprocate when you are\nolder and need care. Nonetheless, it does seem that parents and\nchildren owe one another a special degree of concern and commitment.\nIf the defender of special obligations is attempting to accommodate\ncommonsense morality, then she will have done so to a very limited\nextent if she allows only those special obligations that are acquired\nthrough explicit contracts or promises.\n\nSo consider (ii), i.e., claiming that while some special obligations\nmay initially appear to be non-contractual in nature, they are really\ncontractual. We can see, for example, Locke\u2019s famous appeal to\nthe notion of tacit consent in the political context as an instance of\nthis second strategy. In the Second Treatise of Government,\nLocke claims that we have special political obligations, i.e.,\nobligations to our own government that we do not have to all\ngovernments. He himself, however, imagines someone responding, when he\nproposes that these special political obligations are contractual in\nnature, \u201c[t]hat all men being born under government, some or\nother, it is impossible any of them should ever be free, and at\nliberty to unite together, and begin a new one, or ever be able to\nerect a lawful government\u201d (61). In other words, given our\nsituations as being born into particular governments, it certainly\ndoesn\u2019t appear that our special obligations to our governments\nare contractual in nature. Thus, if we accept voluntarism (as Locke\nclearly did), then it seems that we cannot have special political\nobligations.\n\nLocke famously appeals to the notion of tacit consent in\norder to accommodate special political obligations given his\nvoluntarist commitment: \u201cevery man, that hath any possessions,\nor enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of any government, doth\nthereby give his tacit consent, and is as far forth\nobliged to obedience to the laws of that government, during such\nenjoyment, as any one under it\u201d (64). A person gives tacit or\nimplicit, as opposed to express or explicit, consent, when her consent\nis expressed via refraining from some action or type of action. As A.\nJohn Simmons (1979) has argued, either refraining from or performing\nsome action can only be taken as indicative of consent when certain\nconditions are met: the person must be aware that she is in a\nsituation in which consent is appropriate and/or expected, it must be\nmade clear in some way what must be done or not done in order to give\nconsent, it must be clear when action is to be taken or avoided, and\nthe consent-giving action or failure to act must be possible and not\nextraordinarily costly. It has been argued that the political context,\nat least as it is in the modern nation-state, fails to meet any of the\nabove conditions, and so it is implausible, if one accepts voluntarism\nand the claim that all voluntarily assumed obligations are contractual\nin nature, to suppose that persons in modern nation-states have\nspecial political obligations.\n\nWhile appeal to tacit consent is most familiar in the context of\nattempting to ground special political obligations, one could also use\nthis notion in order to ground, for example, special obligations to\nfriends. Again, however, one would have to show that friendship is a\ncontext that meets the conditions as described by Simmons, and it\nseems implausible to suppose that it is. Further, however, some would\nhave a further objection to construing obligations of friendship as\ncontractual: such a model seems to misconstrue the nature of\nfriendship as involving, as Aristotle claimed, concern for the other\nfor the other\u2019s own sake. Whether or not one can accommodate\nobligations of friendship (or obligations of parents to care for their\nchildren) as grounded on tacit consent, it seems quite clear that, for\nexample, familial obligations, such as those of children to parents,\ndo not involve anything like a promise or contract, either express or\ntacit. Again, as with option (i), option (ii) does not go far toward\naccommodating the range of special obligations recognized by\ncommonsense morality.\n\nThe third strategy available to a voluntarist defender of special\nobligations is to argue that while it is not the case that all special\nobligations are reducible to contractual obligations, nonetheless, all\nspecial obligations share the feature of voluntary assumption with\ncontractual obligations. All special obligations, according to this\naccount, are forms of voluntary commitments undertaken by the\nindividual moral agent. While not all actions that constitute the\nundertaking of a commitment mimic those involved in the making of a\npromise or contract, they are all such that the agent can choose\nwhether or not to perform them. Also, while promises and contracts are\ntemporally discrete events, a commitment may be undertaken via a\ntemporally extended series of events, each of which, in and of itself,\nhas no moral significance: it is only the series taken as a whole that\ngenerates or grounds special obligations. While this strategy has the\nvirtue of being able to accommodate obligations of friendship without\ndistorting the nature of friendship, it, like the previous voluntarist\noptions, holds out little hope of accommodating political or familial\nspecial obligations. At this point, the voluntarist is faced with a\nchoice: either reject her initial commitment to voluntarism regarding\nspecial obligations or reject the commonsense claim about the\nextensive range of special obligations that we have.\n\nSome have been dissatisfied with the seeming limitations placed on the\nextent of our special obligations by the voluntarist thesis. (Again,\nonly voluntarism with respect to special obligations is under\ndiscussion here. Voluntarism with respect to all of our duties would\nseriously delimit our moral responsibilities, and so, for that reason,\nis held by virtually no one.) Common sense morality, after all, seems\nto endorse a host of obligations derived from persons\u2019s roles or\npositions, even when these roles or positions are not occupied as the\nresult of any voluntary choice on the part of the moral agent. Each of\nus occupies various roles; for example, I am my mother\u2019s\ndaughter, my brother\u2019s sister, a university professor, a U.S.\ncitizen, a resident of Iowa, etc. Some people occupy positions in\nreligious communities as, e.g., Jews or Catholics or Hindus, some are\nmembers of armed forces, some belong to clubs, sports teams, etc. Our\nunderstandings of what it is to occupy a certain role often involves\ncertain normative assumptions about the person\u2019s obligations in\nvirtue of occupying that role. So, for example, in virtue of being an\nOrthodox Jew, Joe Schmoe is obligated not to eat pork, in virtue of\nbeing a philosophy professor, I am obligated to provide assistance to\nmy students, and in virtue of being my mother\u2019s daughter, I am\nobligated to care for her when she is elderly. So role obligations,\ni.e., obligations that we have in virtue of occupying some role\n(whether or not voluntarily assumed), appear to be special\nobligations: they are usually owed to some limited class of persons\nand one acquires them through some actions of one\u2019s own or in\nvirtue of one\u2019s status, not as a result of intrinsic features of\nthe obligee or of the state of affairs to be promoted.\n\nBut, of course, we always need to distinguish between moral and\nnon-moral (or reason-giving and non-reason-giving) obligations of role\n(or position). It is true that our very understanding of certain roles\nseems to involve the having of certain obligations, duties, or\nresponsibilities. To be a daughter, for example, involves certain\ncare-taking responsibilities toward parents, just as being a professor\nof philosophy involves obligations to students, colleagues, and the\nprofession more generally. But, analogously, being the commandant of a\nconcentration camp in Nazi Germany seemed to involve certain\nobligations of role, including using slave labor as productively as\npossible and killing as many Jews as possible on a daily basis. Also,\nOrthodox Jewish women have certain role obligations to be submissive\nto their husbands and to refrain from certain forms of work, study,\nand participation in religious observance. However, the sense in which\na commandant of a camp has obligations of role does not seem to be a\nmoral or reason-giving sense, and it is at least an open question as\nto whether Orthodox Jewish women have obligations to be submissive to\nthe male members of their community. Such language of obligations of\nroles seems to involve merely others\u2019 expectations of persons\nholding such positions. Why, a voluntarist (or anyone else, for that\nmatter) will ask, should we suppose that such expectations are\nsufficient for the having of obligations in the reason-giving or moral\nsense?\n\nAnti-voluntarists have taken at least five different routes to\nresponding to this voluntarist worry about the normative status of\nobligations of role or position (the names used here are not\nnecessarily used by those who take one or the other of these options):\n(i) the \u2018true community\u2019 view, (ii) the \u2018reflective\nacceptance\u2019 view, (iii) the \u2018justice view\u2019, (iv) the\nappeal to value, and (v) the \u2018constitutive commitment\u2019\nview. In assessing these various options, we need to keep in mind the\nrange of roles that people can occupy, ranging from being the parent\nof or being a university professor to being the commandant of a\nconcentration camp or the member of a terrorist organization. If roles\nor positions generate moral or reason-giving obligations, we need some\nconception of roles that does not yield the implausible implication\nthat Nazis had moral obligations to herd Jews into gas chambers.\nFurther, we need some conception of a role or position that does not\nreduce all obligations to obligations of role or position. If natural\nduties are not to be rendered obligations of role or position, we need\nto be told why being a moral agent is not a role, but being an\nAmerican is. In other words, what descriptions of a person constitute\nstatements of that person\u2019s obligation-generating roles and\nwhich do not? Why is the fact that I am my mother\u2019s daughter\nconstitutive of a role that I occupy whereas being a human being or\nbeing a person born in the latter half of May on the cusp of Taurus\nand Gemini is not?\n\nLet us begin with (i) as advocated by Ronald Dworkin. Dworkin uses the\nterm \u2018associative [or, communal] obligations\u2019 to refer to\nwhat have been called obligations of role. By \u2018associative\nobligations\u2019 Dworkin means \u201cthe special responsibilities\nsocial practice attaches to membership in some biological or social\ngroup, like the responsibilities of family or friends or\nneighbors\u201d (196). Because his understanding of these obligations\nis not such as to require \u2018choice or consent,\u2019 Dworkin\nthinks that we can construe special political obligations as\nassociative obligations.\n\nHowever, according to Dworkin, only in a true community do members\nhave associative obligations toward one another. Whereas a bare\ncommunity is one that \u201cmeets the genetic or geographical or\nother historical conditions identified by social practice as capable\nof constituting a fraternal community,\u201d the members of a true\ncommunity meet the following four conditions (201):\n\nFirst, they must regard the group\u2019s obligations as\nspecial, holding distinctly within the group, rather than as\ngeneral duties its members owe equally to persons outside it. Second,\nthey must accept that these responsibilities are personal:\nthat they run directly from each member to each other member, not just\nto the group as a whole in some collective sense. \u2026 Third,\nmembers must see these responsibilities as flowing from a more general\nresponsibility each has of concern for the well-being of\nothers in the group \u2026 Fourth, members must suppose that the\ngroup\u2019s practices show not only concern but an equal\nconcern for all members. (199\u2013200)\n\n\nThus, on Dworkin\u2019s account, mere social expectation is not\nsufficient to create associative obligations: persons must meet\ncertain psychological requirements in order for their group, be it a\nfriendship, a family, or a nation-state, to be the sort of community\nsuch that membership in that community, independent of choice or\nconsent, grounds associative obligations.\n\nReturning to the issues raised about role positions, we can notice\nthat a community could satisfy Dworkin\u2019s requirements for being\na true community and yet be such that we might not want to regard its\nmembers as having special moral obligations to one another. Consider a\nwhite supremacist organization: it might very well meet all of the\ncriteria that Dworkin lays out as both necessary and sufficient for a\ncommunity\u2019s being a true community. But is it really the case\nthat members of white supremacist organizations have special moral\nobligations in virtue of being a member of, e.g., Aryan Nation? One\nresponse is that in fact they do have prima facie special obligations\nof role to one another, but that, given the hideous nature of the aims\nof Aryan Nation, those obligations are never their\nall-things-considered duties, i.e., their obligations of role are\nalways outweighed by their natural duties or duties of justice. But\nthe question then remains: why do white supremacists have special,\nadditional moral obligations toward one another simply in virtue of\ntheir having a joint commitment to the immoral treatment of blacks and\nJews?\n\nSo let us consider approach (ii), the reflective acceptance view, as\nadvocated by Michael Hardimon in his \u201cRole Obligations.\u201d\nHardimon aims to offer an account of obligations attached to certain\ninstitutionally defined roles, namely \u201cpolitical, familial, and\noccupational roles\u201d (334), where a role is a\n\u201c[constellation] of institutionally specified rights and duties\norganized around an institutionally specified social function\u201d\n(334). A role obligation, according to Hardimon, is \u201ca moral\nrequirement, which attaches to an institutional role, whose content is\nfixed by the function of the role, and whose normative force flows\nfrom the role\u201d (334). Some role obligations attach to unchosen\nsocial roles, but only to social roles that are reflectively\nacceptable:\n\nTo say that a social role is reflectively acceptable is to\nsay that one would accept it upon reflection. Determining whether a\ngiven social role is reflectively acceptable involves stepping back\nfrom that role in thought and asking whether it is a role people ought\nto occupy and play. Determining that a given social role is\nreflectively acceptable involves judging that it is (in some sense)\nmeaningful, rational, or good. (348)\n\n\nThus, on Hardimon\u2019s account, it is hypothetical rather than\nactual consent that grounds unchosen special obligations. (Some have\ninterpreted Locke as in fact appealing to hypothetical rather than to\nactual consent. It is important to see that hypothetical consent is\nnot really consent, and so a view such as Hardimon\u2019s is not a\nvoluntarist view, as Hardimon himself readily acknowledges.)\n\nThe obvious question for Hardimon\u2019s view is why we need to\nappeal to the notion of reflective acceptance at all. It seems that\nwhat Hardimon is really appealing to as a necessary condition of a\nrole\u2019s generating obligations is that\u2019s role being\n\u2018meaningful, rational, or good\u2019. As we saw, a difficulty\nwith (i), the true community view, is that it leaves open the\npossibility that occupying a role in an unjust community still\ngenerates obligations. Hardimon is clearly worried about this issue\nand so makes appeal to what one would judge good or just if one were\nto make such a judgment (and, let\u2019s assume, judge correctly).\nBut then the hypothetical judgment is really epiphenomenal with\nrespect to the justification and we are left with (iii), the justice\nview: one has obligations in virtue of occupying a role if and only if\none\u2019s filling that role and the institution in which one would\nbe filling that role meet certain conditions of morality or\njustice.\n\nIs this justice or morality condition, however, sufficient? Suppose\nthat all of my neighbors organize the \u201cWest Side Reading\nGroup,\u201d which will meet once a month at the local coffee house\nto discuss edifying books, articles, etc. Members of the group are\nobligated to attend a certain number of meetings a year, participate\nin discussions, and recommend books or articles to other members of\nthe group. Everyone who lives in a certain sector of the west side of\ntown is a member of the group. Given that I live in that part of the\nwest side of town, I am thereby a member of the group. Do I have\nobligations to attend meetings, etc.? The group appears to be just and\nto have good ends. Given that I am well-read, it would be good if I\nwere to contribute to the group, and my participating would certainly\nnot be unjust or immoral. But why suppose that I have special\nobligations to other members of the reading group simply because those\nothers have decided to describe me in a certain way, even if their\ngroup is a good group with just and worthy goals in which I could\nparticipate without violating any requirements of justice or\nmorality?\n\nA similar difficulty plagues (iv), the appeal to value, as defended by\nSamuel Scheffler in his \u201cRelationships and\nResponsibilities.\u201d Scheffler argues that relationships give rise\nto special obligations only when persons have reason to value the\nrelationships. Scheffler\u2019s argument has the following form:\n\n(1) We have good reason to value (noninstrumentally) certain\nrelationships with other persons.\n\n\n(2) To value (noninstrumentally) relationships with others is, in\npart, to see those relationships as a source of reasons, that is, as a\nsource of special obligations.\n\n(3) Therefore, we have good reason to see ourselves as having special\nobligations.\n\n\nScheffler\u2019s claim is that the very act of valuing certain types\nof relationships involves seeing ourselves as having special\nobligations. If we have reason to value the relationship, then we have\nreason to understand ourselves as having special obligations,\nregardless of whether we have chosen to enter or to maintain the\nrelationship. The plausibility of Scheffler\u2019s view depends, to a\nlarge extent, upon what counts as a relationship in this context. Do I\nstand in the relevant sort of relationship to other members of the\nWest Side Reading Group? As stated above, it seems that I have reason\nto value being a member of the group in so far as my being in the\ngroup would promote my well-being and the well-being of the other\nmembers. So, according to Scheffler, I have reason to see myself as\nhaving special obligations to other members of the group. But it\nhardly seems that I am not fulfilling obligations when I fail to go to\nmeetings.\n\nThe final view that I will consider, Michael Sandel\u2019s\nantivoluntarism, is motivated by dissatisfaction with Western liberal\npolitical theory as exemplified by, for example, Locke and John Rawls.\nSandel claims that adherence to voluntarism is inconsistent with the\nnature of the person. Sandel advocates (v), the claim that certain\nroles that we find ourselves in, understood as involving special\nobligations, are \u2018constitutive commitments.\u2019 The person is\nnot free to make all of her own commitments, because the self cannot\nbe understood separately from certain commitments, such as those\narising from family or political community. Sandel is objecting to\nwhat he takes to be the standard, liberal picture of the self: free to\nchoose her own ends and only having those special obligations that\nresult from her voluntary choices.\n\nThe plausibility of Sandel\u2019s version of anti-voluntarism\ndepends, of course, upon the plausibility of the claim that persons\nare partially constituted by their relationships to other persons or\ngroups of persons. In order to assess the plausibility of that claim,\nwe need to disambiguate two possible readings of it, a causal reading\nand a metaphysical reading. The first, causal reading of the claim is\nobviously true: persons are the sort of persons that they are as a\nresult of their causal interactions with other persons and groups of\npersons. Nobody would deny this causal reading of Sandel\u2019s\nclaim, but it is not at all clear how it would support any normative\nconclusions. After all, other persons can have negative as well as\npositive effects on my character and personality. Why suppose that I\nhave special obligations as a result of interactions over which I\nmight have no control?\n\nThe second, metaphysical reading of Sandel\u2019s claim needs more\ndefense. According to Sandel, certain of my relationships to other\npersons are partly constitutive of the person that I am. According to\nthe metaphysical reading of that claim, I would not be the same person\nthat I now am if, for example, I had not been born in the U.S. In\nother words, I am necessarily an American. At best, such a claim is\ncontroversial, at worst, obviously false. After all, I certainly seem\nto be able to conceive of myself as having been born in France, having\nbeen born an Orthodox Jew, or being born an only child instead of\nhaving a brother as I do. So before we can even ask whether a\n\u2018constitutive commitment\u2019 would have normative\nimplications, we need to be told quite a bit more as to why we should\nview ourselves as being partly constituted by the relationships in\nwhich we happen to stand to other people. On either reading of\nSandel\u2019s claim, the constitutive commitments view faces all of\nthe difficulties inherent in any form of relativism: if I am born in a\nsexist culture, for example, why suppose that I thereby have\nobligations to obey the men in my life? A view such as Sandel\u2019s\nseems to make it the case that I am morally obligated as a result of\nthe social structures into which I am born, no matter how morally\nrepugnant those social structures might be. It is this sort of worry\nthat gives even greater credence to the voluntarist thesis with\nrespect to special obligations.\n",
