    "main_text": "Comparative confidence\n7. Imprecise credences\n\nIn the imprecise credence model, we typically represent an\nindividual\u2019s epistemic state not as a single credence function,\nbut as a set of credence functions, and we assume those credence\nfunctions are probabilistic. There are various related\nrepresentations, some of which are more powerful, some less, such as\nupper and lower previsions, sets of desirable gambles, and probability\nfilters. I\u2019ll focus here on sets of probability functions.\n\nThe central result in this area is that there are no measures of\nepistemic utility for imprecise credences that have the property\nanalogous to the property of strict propriety in the precise case.\nThere are three versions of these results, starting with a theorem due\nto Seidenfeld, Schervish, and Kadane (2012), and including adaptations\nby Miriam Schoenfield (2017) and Conor Mayo-Wilson and Gregory Wheeler\n(2016). I'll present Schoenfield\u2019s, since it\u2019s the most\nstraightforward.\n\nSchoenfield considers the simplest sort of case, where our individual\nonly has opinions about a proposition and its negation. And she\nassumes that any measure of epistemic utility for imprecise credences\nhas the following properties:\n\n\nExtension When restricted to precise probabilities\nover those two propositions, the measure of epistemic utility is\nmaximized at the omniscient credence function and it is\ncontinuous.\n\nBoundedness Epistemic utilities are measured by real\nnumbers. \n\nProbabilistic Admissibility For any precise credal\nstate, there is no imprecise credal state that is at least as good as\nthat precise state at all worlds. \n\n\nThen Schoenfield shows that, if Extension, Boundedness, and\nProbabilistic Admissibility hold, then for any imprecise set, there is\na precise probabilistic credence function that has equal epistemic\nutility at every world. This seems problematic, because it suggests\nthat it can never be rationally required to have imprecise credences,\nand their proponents typically think it can be.\n\nJason Konek (2019) has proposed a way to avoid this concern. He argues\nthat, in fact, we should not expect a single measure of epistemic\nutility to work for every situation. The idea is that our measure of\nepistemic utility for imprecise credences encodes not only our\nattitude to accuracy, but also our attitude to epistemic risk, and for\neach legitimate way of measuring epistemic utility, there is a family\nof imprecise credences that are endorsed by it. So all that is really\nrequired is that, for any coherent imprecise credences, there is a\nlegitimate way of measuring epistemic utility that endorses them: that\nis, where they consider themselves best from that point of view.\n8. Future directions\n\nWe have seen that epistemic utility arguments provide a fruitful\napproach to epistemic norms. We conclude in this section by\nhighlighting some possible avenues for future research, though this\nlist is by no means exhaustive:\n\nOne attraction of the epistemic utility approach is that it does\nnot only provide us with a means by which to establish norms that we\nhave already formulated; it also allows provides a process by which to\nformulate new norms governing different situations that we can then\nuse it justify. The recipe is straightforward: specify the situation;\nspecify your measure of epistemic utility; ask what properties an\nepistemic state must have if it is to optimize that measure of\nepistemic utility in that situation. For instance, it is this approach\nthat lead from Joyce\u2019s argument for Probabilism, to Greaves\n& Wallace\u2019s argument for Conditionalization, to\nMyrvold\u2019s approach to the value of learning new evidence.\nIncreasingly, epistemologists are considering less and less idealized\nepistemic situations: situations in which you have evidence, but you\ndon\u2019t know what that evidence is (Williamson 2000); situations\nin which you have higher-order evidence that casts doubt on your\nfirst-order reasoning (Feldman 2005); and so on. The epistemic utility\napproach is ideally situated to help formulate norms to govern these\nnon-ideal situations.\nWhile there is some work on how to choose between different ways\nof measuring epistemic utility, more could be done (Pettigrew 2016,\nLevinstein 2017). What reason do we have for using one strictly proper\nscoring rule rather than another?\nWhile much work on epistemic utility assumes, along with the\nveritist, that the sole fundamental source of epistemic value is truth\nor gradational accuracy, other parts of epistemology talk of further\nor alternative sources, such as explanatory power or being formed by\nan epistemically virtuous process. How would we measure epistemic\nutility if these are among its sources?\nA final, rather obvious suggestion is that there are substantial\nobjections to the approach that must still be addressed. We have met\nmany of them over the course of this survey, from Levinstein\u2019s\nVarying Importance Objection in\n Section 5.1.1\n to the Act-State Dependence worry in\n Section 5.2.3\n to Jennifer Carr\u2019s epistemic expansions concern in\n Section 5.2.4.\n These three, as well as others detailed above, still lack truly\ncompelling responses.\n\n\nThere is still much to be done.\n",
