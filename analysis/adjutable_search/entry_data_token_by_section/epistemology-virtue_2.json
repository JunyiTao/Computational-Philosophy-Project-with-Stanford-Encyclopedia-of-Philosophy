    "main_text": "The Nature of Intellectual Virtues\n3. The Nature of Intellectual Virtues\n\nStart with an uncontroversial, but still informative, characterization\nof intellectual virtues: intellectual virtues are characteristics that\npromote intellectual flourishing, or which make for an excellent\ncognizer.\n\nVE is standardly divided up into virtue responsibilists and virtue\nreliabilists (e.g., Axtell 1997). According to this taxonomy, the two\ncamps differ over how to characterize intellectual virtue. Virtue\nreliabilists (e.g., Goldman, Greco, and Sosa) understand intellectual\nvirtues to include faculties such as perception, intuition, and\nmemory; call these \u2018faculty-virtues\u2019. Their view is best\nunderstood as a descendant from earlier externalist epistemologies\nsuch as simple process reliabilism. Virtue responsibilists (e.g.,\nBattaly, Code, Hookway, Montmarquet, and Zagzebski) understand\nintellectual virtues to include cultivated character traits such as\nconscientiousness and open-mindedness; call these\n\u2018trait-virtues\u2019. Their approach is broadly aligned with\ninternalist sympathies in epistemology and deeply concerned with\ncognition\u2019s ethical dimensions and implications.\n\nThis reliabilist/responsibilist taxonomy has attracted criticism\n(Fleisher 2017). First, it is not clear why practitioners need to\nchoose between faculty-virtues and trait-virtues. At first glance,\nexcellent perception, good memory, open-mindedness, and intellectual\nhumility all seem equally good candidates to manifest excellence or\npromote flourishing. Arguments over which are the\n\u201creal\u201d virtues can seem pointless and counterproductive,\nsince many are the ways of excelling and flourishing intellectually\n(Battaly 2015). Second, and closely related, it is plausible that a\ncomplete epistemology must feature both faculty-virtues and\ntrait-virtues. Faculty-virtues seem indispensable in accounting for\nknowledge of the past and the world around us. Trait-virtues could be\nrequired to account for the full range of richer intellectual\nachievements, such as understanding and wisdom, which might presuppose\nknowledge but which arguably also exceed it (compare Zagzebski 2001:\n248\u20139). Baehr (2006b) argues that virtue reliabilists should not\nneglect trait-virtues, because these are necessary to explain some\ncases of knowledge. For instance, intellectual courage and\nperseverance, not just good memory and perception, might figure\ncentrally in an explanation of how a knower arrived at the truth.\n\nBattaly (2008: 7) provides a helpful list of questions to guide\ninquiry into the nature of intellectual virtue:\n\n\nThere are five primary questions that analyses of the intellectual\nvirtues should address. First, are the virtues natural or acquired?\nSecond, does virtue possession require the agent to possess acquired\nintellectually virtuous motivations or dispositions to perform\nintellectually virtuous actions? Third, are the virtues distinct from\nskills? Fourth, are the virtues reliable? Finally, fifth, what makes\nthe virtues valuable? Are they instrumentally, constitutively, or\nintrinsically valuable?\n\n\nJason Kawall (2002) calls attention to a set of virtues neglected by\nvirtue epistemologists of all stripes. Virtue ethicists have long\nrecognized a difference between self-regarding moral virtues, such as\nprudence and courage, and other-regarding virtues, such as benevolence\nand compassion. And they have recognized the importance of both sorts.\nBut virtue epistemologists have overlooked a similar distinction among\nintellectual virtues. They focus on self-regarding intellectual\nvirtues, such as perceptual acuity or intellectual courage, which\npromote the individual\u2019s own intellectual flourishing. They\nneglect other-regarding intellectual virtues, such as honesty and\nintegrity, which promote other people\u2019s acquisition of knowledge\nand intellectual flourishing. More complex other-regarding virtues\nwould involve a willingness and ability to articulately communicate\none\u2019s reasons to others, or the creativity to discover knowledge\nnew to a community. \u201cAn epistemic agent who focuses exclusively\non self-regarding epistemic virtues\u201d, Kawall (2002: 260) writes,\n\u201ccould be a deficient epistemic agent to the extent that she is\na member of a community\u201d. Such attention to the cognitive\nagent\u2019s epistemic community also informs research on epistemic\njustice and injustice (Fricker 2007, Sherman 2016) and recent\nexplorations of embedded, scaffolded, and extended intellectual\ncharacter (Alfano 2013b; Alfano & Skorburg 2017, 2018), topics to\nwhich we return in section 9.\n",
