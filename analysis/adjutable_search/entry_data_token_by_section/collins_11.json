    "main_text": "Collins, Deism and Freethinking || A Discourse of Free Thinking, 1713\n4.3 A Discourse of Free Thinking, 1713\n\nLike Locke, Collins is an advocate of the use of reason to determine\nreligious truths. One necessary condition for being able to think\nfreely is not to be persecuted for considering views that are\ndifferent from the accepted ones. Only in such an environment can one\ngenuinely consider alternatives. It must be possible to adopt\nwhichever of the possibilities turns out to be the most reasonable.\nCollins, like Locke, is committed to the view that one should\nproportion assent to a proposition on the basis of the evidence for\nit. Religious persecution aims to limit the possibilities and the\nevidence that one can consider. Though Collins was strongly\nanti-clerical, he does distinguish between good priests and bad\npriests. The good priests are the ones who advocate freedom of\nthought; the bad priests, on the other hand, are persecutors who want\nto prevent people from thinking through the truths of religion for\nthemselves. In his own time, Collins\u2019 most controversial work\nwas his A Discourse of Freethinking (1714).\n\nConcerning the Discourse, J.M. Robertson writes that it \n\n\n\u2026may be said to sum up and unify the drift not only of previous\nEnglish freethinking, but of the great contribution of Bayle, whose\nlearning and temper influence all English deism from Shaftesbury\nonward. (Robertson 1915: 123) \n\n\nPerhaps the motto of A Discourse of Free-Thinking ought to be\n\u201cWhere experts disagree, any person is free to reason for\nthemselves\u201d. Collins is chiefly concerned with religion, so the\nvast bulk of the disagreements he cites have to do with religious\nissues, from whether one religion is better than another, down to the\ndetails of Anglicanism. Looking at conflicting claims often leads to\nskepticism. Where exactly this approach leads Collins is a question\nthat we will have to consider.\n\nIn A Discourse of Free-thinking Collins defines free-thinking\nas \n\n\nThe Use of the Understanding, in endeavouring to find out the Meaning\nof any Proposition whatsoever, in considering the nature and Evidence\nfor or against it, and in judging of it according to the seeming Force\nor Weakness of the Evidence. (Collins 1713 [1984: 5) \n\n\nCollins claims that we have a right to think freely. Richard Bently in\nhis Remarks about a Late Discourse of Free-Thinking charges\nthat this definition is too broad\u2014that it amounts to a\ndefinition of thinking. James O\u2019Higgins in his study of Collins\nagrees with Bently. This, however, is not a good evaluation.\nCollins\u2019 account is surely intended to rule out believing\nwithout evidence, or against the evidence, or without carefully\nconsidering conflicting evidence. Either these are not going to be\nadmitted as thinking at all, or Collins\u2019 definition is not too\nbroad.\n\nThe Discourse is divided into three sections. In the first\ntwo Collins gives a series of arguments in favor of free-thinking and\nin the third he answers objections to free-thinking and gives a list\nof historical figures who he views as free-thinkers. The arguments\ntreat thinking effectively as like a craft or art and a number of the\nearly arguments work on this analogy. He claims that just as putting\nrestrictions on painting would reduce the proficiency of the painter,\nso putting restrictions on thinking can only reduce the proficiency of\nthe thinker. To fail to think freely leads to the holding of absurd\nbeliefs and superstition. Collins gives a brief history of the efforts\nof priests to control what people believe by fraud from the ancient\nworld to the Reformation. Collins then claims that free-thinking is\nresponsible for the decline in the belief in witchcraft.\n\nSection 2 begins with Collins arguing that right opinion in matters of\nreligion is supposed to be essential to salvation and errors to lead\nto damnation. But if one is not to think freely oneself about such\nsubjects, then one must simply take up the opinions of those among\nwhom one happens to live. But this means that they will only be right\nby accident. On the other hand, if people think freely, they will have\n\u201cthe evidence of things to determine them to the side of\ntruth\u201d (Collins 1713 [1984: 33). There are in all ages an\ninfinite number of pretenders to revelations from Heaven, supported by\nmiracles. These pretenders offer new notions of the Deity, new\ndoctrines, commands, ceremonies and modes of worship. To decide which\nof these are genuine and which spurious requires that one think freely\nabout the competing evidence that would show that one is genuine while\nthe other an imposter. Collins remarks that since the Anglican Church\nhas an organization to support foreign missionaries (The Society for\nPropagating the Gospel in Foreign Lands) this really requires\nsupporting free-thinking throughout the world and therefore at home as\nwell. Indeed: \n\n\nAs there can be no reasonable change of opinions among men, no\nquitting of any old religion, no reception of any new religion, nor\nbelieving any religion at all, but by means of free-thinking; so the\nHoly Scriptures agreeably to reason, and to the design of our blessed\nSavior of establishing his religion throughout the whole universe,\nimply everywhere and press in many places the duty of free thinking.\n(Collins 1713 [1984: 43\u201346]) \n\n\nFinally Collins claims that the conduct of the priests \n\n\nwho are the chief Pretenders to be the Guides to others in matters of\nReligion, makes free-thinking on the nature and attributes of the\neternal being of God, on the authority of the scriptures, and on the\nsense of scriptures, unavoidable. (Collins 1713 [1984: 46]) \n\n\nHe goes on to list disagreements and differences of opinion among\npriests on all these topics.\n\nIn section 3 Collins takes up various objections to free-thinking. To\nsuppose that all men have a right to think freely on all subjects is\nto suppose that they have the capacity to do so. But they do not. So\nit is absurd to think that they have a duty to think freely. Collins\nreplies that to suppose a right to a thing \u201calso implies a Right\nin him to let it alone, if he thinks fit\u201d (Collins 1713 [1984:\n100). As for free-thinking being a duty, Collins responds that it is\nso only in cases where those who contend \u201cfor the Necessity of\nall Men\u2019s assenting to certain Propositions, must allow that men\nare qualify\u2019d to do so\u201d (ibid.). If it were the case that\nthe great bulk of mankind lacked the capacity to think freely on\nmatters of speculation, then the priests should conclude that men\nshould in no way be concerned about truth and falsehood in speculative\nmatters. In short, they should hold no opinion. Even in this case,\nhowever, the right to think freely would remain untouched in those\ndisposed to think freely. The second objection is that to encourage\nfree-thinking \u201cwill produce endless Divisions of Opinion and by\nconsequence Disorders in Society\u201d. Collins suggests that the\nconsequence is false and that any remedy is worse than the disease.\nThird, free-thinking may lead to atheism. Collins points out that many\ndivines hold that there never was a real atheist in the world while\nBacon holds that contemplative atheists are rare. Still, even if\nfree-thinking were to produce many atheists, the number of those who\nare superstitious or enthusiastic that will be produced in the absence\nof free-thinking is even greater. And these are worse evils for\nsociety than atheism. Fourthly, priests are the experts who are to be\nrelied upon in their subject as doctors and lawyers are to be relied\nupon in theirs. Collins argues that the analogy between doctors and\nlawyers and priests does not hold. First, while doctors and lawyers\nact for us, we need not believe the principles or opinions on which\none prescribes and the other acts. But in matters of religion,\n\u201cI am obliged to believe certain opinions myself. No man\u2019s\nbelief will save me except my own\u201d (Collins 1713: 109). Finally,\nfree-thinkers are \u201cthe most infamous, wicked and senseless of\nall mankind\u201d (Collins 1713: 118). Collins answers this objection\nin various ways\u2014arguing that in fact free-thinking makes one\nvirtuous. He ends by listing a variety of men he considers\nfree-thinkers whose moral character was impeccable\u2014Socrates,\nPlato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Plutarch, Cicero, Varo and others among\nthe ancients. Among the moderns he includes, Bacon, Hobbes and\nArchbishop Tillotson.\n",
