    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nPico was born on February 24, 1463, to a noble Italian family, the\ncounts of Mirandola and Concordia near Modena in the Emilia-Romagna\nnorth of Tuscany. Around the age of fourteen he left for Bologna,\nintending briefly to study canon law, but within two years he moved to\nFerrara and shortly afterward to Padua, where he met one of his most\nimportant teachers, Elia del Medigo, a Jew and an Averroist\nAristotelian. By the time he left Padua in 1482, he had also felt the\nattraction of the Platonism being revived by Marsilio Ficino, and by\n1484 he was corresponding with Angelo Poliziano and Lorenzo\nde\u2019Medici about poetry.\n\nIn 1485 he traveled from Florence to Paris, the citadel of\nAristotelian scholasticism. Before he left, at the age of twenty-two,\nhe had made his first important contribution to philosophy\u2014a\ndefense of the technical terminology which since Petrarch\u2019s time\nhad incited humanist critics of philosophy to attack scholastic Latin\nas a barbaric violation of classical norms. Having refined his\nliterary talent while developing his philosophical skills, Pico issued\nhis manifesto in the form of a letter to the renowned Ermolao Barbaro,\nusing the occasion and the genre to show, like Plato in the\nPhaedrus, how rhetoric could equip a philosopher to defend\nhis calling against rhetorical assault.\n\nAfter a short stay in Paris, Pico returned to Florence, and then\nArezzo, where he caused a scandal by abducting a young woman named\nMargherita, already married to Giuliano Mariotto de\u2019 Medici.\nDespite the support that came from Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, the\ncommotion that followed and then a plague kept Pico on the move, just\nat the time he was writing a Commento on a love poem by\nGirolamo Benivieni and planning his larger scheme of philosophical\nconcord. At its core this project aimed to secure human happiness by\nway of a philosophical harmony between Platonists and Aristotelians.\nBut in keeping with Pico\u2019s immense ambition, the scope of the\neffort became global, striving to join all schools of thought in a\nsingle symphony of philosophies. Pico planned to underwrite a\nmagnificent conference on this theme in Rome early in 1487, and in\npreparation he assembled 900 theses from numerous\nauthorities\u2014ancient and medieval, pagan and Christian, Moslem\nand Jewish. He had these Conclusions printed in Rome at the\nend of 1486, and to introduce them he composed a work of eventually\nimmense fame, the Oration on the Dignity of Man\u2014as it\ncame to be called.\n\nIntervention by the Holy See derailed Pico\u2019s plans and blocked\nthe conference. Innocent VIII appointed a commission that first\ndeclared six of the theses suspect and condemned seven others, then\nrejected Pico\u2019s clarifications and repudiated all thirteen. When\nthe Apology that Pico hastily published provoked Innocent to\ndenounce all nine hundred Conclusions, the audacious young\nCount left for Paris, but at the pope\u2019s request he was detained\nby French authorities and briefly jailed. By the summer of 1488 he was\nback in Fiesole as the guest of Lorenzo, to whom in 1489 he dedicated\na short work called Heptaplus, on the Sevenfold Account of the Six\nDays of Genesis.\n\nSince 1483 Pico had a third of the income produced by his\nfamily\u2019s estates, which along with his Mirandola property he\ntransferred in 1491 to his nephew Gianfrancesco, who was to become an\nimportant philosopher in his own right and an early voice for the\nrevival of scepticism as an instrument of Christian faith. At this\ntime, however, even after the dust had settled on the provocative\nConclusions, contemporaries were unsure of the elder\nPico\u2019s orthodoxy, and the Kabbalist exegesis of Genesis in the\nHeptaplus\u2014tame though it is by Pico\u2019s earlier\nstandards\u2014could scarcely restore their confidence. Meanwhile,\nPico pursued safer philological inquiries with Poliziano, who received\nthe dedication of a fragment On Being and the One in 1492.\nEven though De ente et uno was meant as the first installment\nof the great work that would prove Plato\u2019s thought in concord\nwith Aristotle\u2019s, not everyone accepted Pico\u2019s position\nharmoniously\u2014least of all Antonio Cittadini, a Pisan professor\nwho was still fighting about it with Gianfrancesco Pico two years\nafter his uncle\u2019s death.\n\nIn 1493 Pico achieved reconciliation with a higher authority when\nAlexander VI pardoned him for his earlier misadventures. By this time\nhe had already grown close to Girolamo Savonarola, the fearsome\nmillenarian preacher who had recently become Prior of the Dominican\nConvent of San Marco in Florence. Pico had known the prophetic friar\nfor some time, but now Savonarola was on his way to establishing a\ntheocratic tyranny in Florence. Growing ever more saintly, Pico\ndisposed of more of his property, giving some to the Church and some\nto his family, as his habits became less and less worldly. He was\nworking hard on another huge project, the unfinished Disputations\nAgainst Divinatory Astrology, when death (hastened by poison,\nsome said) came to him on November 17, 1494. Florence fell to the\nFrench armies of Charles VIII on the same day, ending the dazzling age\nof Florentine culture that Pico\u2019s blazing genius made all the\nbrighter, though only briefly. Ficino, a steadier spirit, survived him\nby five years.\n",
