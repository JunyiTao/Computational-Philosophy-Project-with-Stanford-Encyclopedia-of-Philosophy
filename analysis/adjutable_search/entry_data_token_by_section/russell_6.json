Russell\u2019s Social and Political Philosophy\n\nRussell\u2019s significant social influence stems from three main\nsources: his long-standing social activism, his many writings on the\nsocial and political issues of his day as well as on more theoretical\nconcerns, and his popularizations of numerous technical writings in\nphilosophy and the natural sciences. \n\nAmong Russell\u2019s many popularizations are his two best-selling\nworks, The Problems of Philosophy (1912) and A History of\nWestern Philosophy (1945). Both of these books, as well as his\nnumerous books popularizing science, have done much to educate and\ninform generations of general readers. His History is still\nwidely read and did much to initiate twentieth-century research on a\nwide range of historical figures from the\n presocratics\n to\n Leibniz.\n His Problems is still used as an introductory textbook over\na century after it was first published. Both books can be read by the\nlayman with satisfaction. Other popular books, particularly those\nrelating to developments in modern science such as The ABC of\nAtoms (1923a) and The ABC of Relativity (1925), are now\nof more historical interest. Even so, they continue to convey\nsomething of the intellectual excitement associated with advances in\ntwentieth-century science and philosophy. \n\nNaturally enough, Russell saw a link between education in this broad\nsense and social progress. As he put it, \u201cEducation is the key\nto the new world\u201d (1926, 83). Partly this is due to our need to\nunderstand nature, but equally important is our need to understand\neach other:\n\n\nThe thing, above all, that a teacher should endeavor to produce in his\npupils, if democracy is to survive, is the kind of tolerance that\nsprings from an endeavor to understand those who are different from\nourselves. It is perhaps a natural human impulse to view with horror\nand disgust all manners and customs different from those to which we\nare used. Ants and savages put strangers to death. And those who have\nnever traveled either physically or mentally find it difficult to\ntolerate the queer ways and outlandish beliefs of other nations and\nother times, other sects and other political parties. This kind of\nignorant intolerance is the antithesis of a civilized outlook, and is\none of the gravest dangers to which our overcrowded world is exposed.\n(1950, 121)\n\n\nIt is in this same context that Russell is famous for suggesting that\na widespread reliance upon evidence, rather than superstition, would\nhave enormous social consequences: \u201cI wish to propose for the\nreader\u2019s favourable consideration,\u201d says Russell, \u201ca\ndoctrine which may, I fear, appear wildly paradoxical and subversive.\nThe doctrine in question is this: that it is undesirable to believe a\nproposition when there is no ground whatever for supposing it\ntrue\u201d (A1928, 11). \n\nUnlike Russell\u2019s views about the importance of education, the\nprecise connection between Russell\u2019s political activism and his\nmore theoretical work has been more controversial. In part, this has\nbeen because Russell himself repeatedly maintained that he saw no\nsignificant connection between his philosophical work and his\npolitical activism. Others have seen things differently. One of the\nbest summaries is given by Alan Wood: \n\nRussell sometimes maintained, partly I think out of perverseness, that\nthere was no connection between his philosophical and political\nopinions. \u2026 But in fact I think there are perfectly obvious\nconnections between Russell\u2019s philosophical and other views.\n\u2026 To begin with, it is natural enough to find an analytic\nanti-monist philosopher like Russell upholding the individual against\nthe state, whereas Hegel did the reverse \u2026 [In addition, the]\nwhole bent of Russell\u2019s mind in philosophy was an attempt to\neliminate the a priori and to accentuate the empirical; and\nthere was exactly the same trend in his political thinking \u2026\nUnless it is realized that Russell\u2019s approach to political\nquestions was usually empirical and practical, based on the evidence\nof the moment and not on a priori principles and\npreconceptions, it is quite impossible to understand why his views\nappeared to vary so much. This was perfectly legitimate, and even\npraiseworthy, in a world which never stays the same, and where\nchanging circumstances continually change the balance of arguments on\ndifferent sides. (Wood 1957, 73\u20134)\n\n\nThus, in addition to Russell\u2019s numerous contributions to the\npolitics of his day, he also contributed significantly to our\nunderstanding of the social world around us. Among Russell\u2019s\nmore theoretical contributions were his anticipation of John\nMackie\u2019s error theory in ethics, the view that moral judgments\nare cognitive (that is, they are either true or false), but because of\ntheir content they in fact are invariably false. (Mackie\u2019s paper\n\u201cThe Refutation of Morals\u201d appeared in 1946;\nRussell\u2019s paper \u201cIs There an Absolute Good?\u201d,\nalthough not published until 1988 was first delivered in 1922.)\n\nRussell also anticipated the modern theory of emotivism (as introduced\nby\n A.J. Ayer\n in his 1936 Language, Truth and Logic), arguing that\n\u201cPrimarily, we call something \u2018good\u2019 when we desire\nit, and \u2018bad\u2019 when we have an aversion from it\u201d\n(1927b, 242), a view that \u201che had been flirting with since\n1913\u201d (see the entry on\n Russell\u2019s Moral Philosophy\n in this encyclopedia; see too Schilpp 1944, 719f). Even so, Russell\nremained less than satisfied with his views on meta-ethics for most of\nhis life (CP, Vol. 11, 310). \n\nThis dissatisfaction appears not to have extended to his work in\npolitical theory. There Russell focused primarily on the notion of\npower, or what he called \u201cthe production of intended\neffects\u201d (1938, 35). As V.J. McGill writes, \u201cThe concept\nof power overshadows all of Russell\u2019s political and economic\nwritings\u201d (Schilpp 1944, 581). Russell himself summarizes his\npoint of view with the observation that \u201cThe laws of social\ndynamics are \u2013 so I shall contend \u2013 only capable of being\nstated in terms of power in its various forms\u201d (1938, 15). As a\nresult, it is only by understanding power in all its human\ninstantiations that we understand the social world around us. \n\nRussell\u2019s cataloging of the perceived evils of his age are well\nknown. (As Popper neatly sums up Russell\u2019s general outlook, \u201cwe\nare clever, perhaps too clever, but we are also wicked; and this\nmixture of cleverness and wickedness lies at the root of our\ntroubles\u201d [1956, 365].) Even so, underlying Russell\u2019s criticism\nof both the political left and the political right lies a common\nworry: the unequal distribution of power. As McGill sums up,\n\u201cEvidently he has become convinced that the thirst for Power is\nthe primary danger of mankind, that possessiveness is evil mainly\nbecause it promotes the power of man over man\u201d (Schilpp 1944,\n581). The problem with this analysis and of Russell\u2019s desire for\na more equitable distribution of power is that any proposed solution\nappears to lead to paradox: \n\nSuppose certain men join a movement to disestablish Power, or to\ndistribute it more equally among the people! If they are successful,\nthey carry out the behest of Power, becoming themselves as powerful,\nin terms of Mr. Russell\u2019s definition, as any tyrant. Even though\nthey spread the good life to millions, the more successful they are,\nthe more usurpatious and dangerous. (Schilpp 1944, 586)\n\n\nLike his writings about religion, Russell\u2019s writings in ethics\nand politics brought him to the attention of large numbers of\nnon-academic readers. His most influential books on these topics\ninclude his Principles of Social Reconstruction (1916),\nOn Education (1926), Marriage and Morals (1929),\nThe Conquest of Happiness (1930), The Scientific\nOutlook (1931), and Power: A New Social Analysis\n(1938).\n",
