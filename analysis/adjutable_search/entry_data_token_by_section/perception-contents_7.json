    "main_text": "Varieties of Content || Possible-Worlds Content\n3.2 Possible-Worlds Content\n\nAnother simple theory says that the contents of experiences are sets\nof possible worlds in which things are as they appear to be in the\nexperience. For instance, if one has a visual experience representing\na red cube, the contents of experience on this view would be a set of\npossible worlds in which there really is a red cube in front of you.\nOr perhaps they might be a set of possible worlds in which the very\ncube C that is actually in front of you is red. The central\nidea behind this view is that to represent a situation\u2014whether\nin language, in thought, or in experience\u2014is to distinguish\nbetween two ways the world might be: first, ways the world might be if\nthe situation does obtain, where these include the actual world;\nsecond, ways the world might be if the situation does not obtain. For\ninstance, if a subject\u2019s experience represents that there is a\nred cube in front of her, she thereby (on this general view of\nrepresentation) represents the actual world as being among the worlds\nin which there is a red cube in front of her. Stalnaker (1984) and\nLewis (1986) think this view best reflects the nature of\nrepresentation. \n\nOne potential problem with possible-worlds contents concerns\nexperiences that represent impossible scenes. Consider the staircase\ndepicted in the Escher drawing, on which one seems to be able to make\nfour consecutive left turns, ending where one begins, yet walking\ndownstairs (or upstairs) the whole time. Another example of\ncontradictory contents comes from the waterfall illusion, when one\nlooks at a stationary object after looking at a waterfall, the object\nappears to move, yet appears to stay still relative to its background.\nSimilar illusions of movement can be achieved by looking at spirals on\npaper. These experiences differ phenomenally from one another.\nMoreover, although all seem to represent both that something is moving\nand that the very same thing is not moving, they represent much more\nspecific scenes as well, and these specifics clearly differ. It seems\nthat possible-worlds contents could not reflect these differences.\nSince the set of possible of worlds in which things are as the\nexperience represents them to be is the null set, the view that says\nthat the only contents of experience are possible worlds would posit\nthe same content (i.e., the null set) for all of them.\n",
