She writes\n\n\nthe Master-Slave dialectic seems to capture the relation between\npeople in pornographic eroticism. In much pornography, people, usually\nwomen, become objects for another \u2026 In the case of pornography,\nwhat happens is that the one person becomes a body desired by the\nother, but this is not reciprocated. (Assiter 1988: 65)\n\n\nTo treat someone as merely a body for another\u2019s use, without\nrecognizing that she too is a subject with desires, is to treat\nsomeone as a slave, as a subhuman creature or object, and therefore\nviolates her dignity as a human being. Assiter explains that, for\nHegel\n\n\n\u201cthe Master-Slave dialectic\u201d is a phase in the development\nof world history\u2014in the progression towards freedom of the\n\u201cSpirit\u201d that controls historical change. In fact, the\nrelation is disadvantageous both for the slave and for the master,\n(Assiter 1988: 65)\n\n\nfor neither gains the forms of recognition necessary for\nself-conscious awareness and emotional fulfillment.\n\nHarry Brod argues that pornography harms men individually even while\nit augments men\u2019s collective power (Brod 1992: 158). Brod\napplies Kantian, Hegelian, and Marxist moral concepts and writes\n\n\nThe female is primarily there as a sex object, not sexual subject. Or,\nif she is not completely objectified, since men do want to be desired\nthemselves, hers is at least a subjugated subjectivity. But one needs\nanother independent subject, not an object or a captured subjectivity,\nif one either wants one\u2019s own prowess validated, or if one\nsimply desires human interaction. Men functioning in the pornographic\nmode of male sexuality, in which men dominate women, are denied\nsatisfaction of these human desires. (Brod 1992: 154)\n\n\nOn Brod\u2019s account, pornography enhances men\u2019s political\npower over women, while diminishing the quality of men\u2019s\nintersubjective relationships with women, and thereby contributes to\nthe loss of positive human interaction and self-realization. Brod also\nargues that pornography contributes to the commodification of\nsexuality, which enhances men\u2019s powers as consumers, although\nnot necessarily their genuine autonomy and freedom.\n\nCatharine MacKinnon also utilizes Kant\u2019s moral philosophy to\narticulate the problem with pornography:\n\n\nA person, in one Kantian view, is a free and rational agent whose\nexistence is an end in itself, as opposed to instrumental. In\npornography women exist to the end of male pleasure.\n(MacKinnon 1987: 158)\n\n\nFor MacKinnon, pornography involves men treating women as mere\ninstruments in order to satisfy their sexual desires. Such treatment,\nat best, fails to recognize women as free and equal persons and, at\nworst, dehumanizes women and encourages their victimization. In\nresponse to MacKinnon, Martha Nussbaum questions whether sexual\nobjectification always involves treating someone as a mere means to\nanother\u2019s ends, or whether it only does so in certain contexts\n(Nussbaum 1999: 214).\n\nNussbaum identifies seven distinct kinds of actions that may or may\nnot be part of objectification in any given instance: instrumentality,\ndenial of autonomy, inertness, fungibility, violability, ownership,\nand denial of subjectivity (Nussbaum 1999: 218). Some of these actions\nare always morally problematic, but some of them are acceptable when\nthey are part of a larger relationship involving mutual respect.\nNussbaum writes\n\n\nDenial of autonomy and denial of subjectivity are objectionable if\nthey persist throughout an adult relationship, but as phases in a\nrelationship characterized by mutual regard they can be all right, or\neven quite wonderful \u2026 In a closely related way, it may at\ntimes be splendid to treat the other person as passive, or even inert.\nEmotional penetration of boundaries seems potentially a very valuable\npart of sexual life, and some forms of physical boundary penetration\nalso, though it is less clear which ones these are. Treating as\nfungible is suspect when the person so treated is from a group that\nhas frequently been commodified and used as a tool, or a prize;\nbetween social equals these problems disappear \u2026. (Nussbaum\n1999: 238\u201339)\n\n\nIn other words, some actions in which we enjoy another\u2019s body\nsexually are consistent with recognizing the person so used as an end\nin herself, and do not involve treating her as a mere object in the\nKantian sense. But Nussbaum concludes that most conventional\npornography, such as Playboy, fails to meet the Kantian moral\nstandard, and\n\n\ndepicts a thoroughgoing fungibility and commodification of sex\npartners and, in the process, severs sex from any deep connection with\nself-expression or emotion. (Nussbaum 1999: 234)\n\n\nNussbaum therefore concurs with MacKinnon that mainstream pornography\ntreats women as mere objects or trophies\u2014things that enhance\nmen\u2019s status or are exchangeable on demand for the next\nattractive body.\n\nAlthough Nussbaum is sympathetic to MacKinnon and Dworkin\u2019s\nanalysis of pornography, she offers four reservations in regard to\nordinances aimed at making pornographers legally liable for the\nalleged harms caused by their materials. First, the justification for\nthe ordinance fails to distinguish between moral wrongs that are\nlegally actionable and those that are not. Second, violence against\nwomen has a variety of causes and it is difficult to isolate the\ndistinct contribution of pornography. Third, making authors\nresponsible for the criminal actions that their work may inspire is\nlikely to have a chilling effect on valuable expression. And fourth,\nofficials and courts are likely to misapply such ordinances to\ncontroversial but not harmful speech (Nussbaum 1999: 248\u2013249).\nNussbaum\u2019s critique avoids invoking an unlimited or overly broad\nright to free speech, as she notes that not all speech is protected by\nthe First Amendment (Nussbaum 1999: 247). She also notes that makers\nof other vice-type products, such as tobacco, can be held liable for\nthe damaging effects of their products, and that other Western\ndemocratic countries permit restrictions on hate speech. Nevertheless,\nNussbaum suggests that the harms of pornography can be addressed\nthrough moral dialogue and cultural analysis. Similarly, Langton, who\nis highly sympathetic to MacKinnon\u2019s analysis of pornography,\nsees it as primarily a moral issue and a philosophical problem\nregarding what it means to live a good life (Langton 2009: 24).\n\nLinda LeMoncheck challenges the view that pornography involves\nunacceptable forms of sexual objectification by arguing that the\nsexual fantasies depicted in pornography imply that women\u2019s\nsubjectivities are recognized by the consumers of this material\n(LeMoncheck 1997: 133). The fantasy of overcoming a woman\u2019s will\nassumes that she has a will to overcome (LeMoncheck 1997: 131), and\nthe fantasy that women enjoy being sexually exploited assumes that\nthey have desires that men\u2019s sexual use fulfills (LeMoncheck\n1997: 133). LeMoncheck writes\n\n\nsex work is not merely about treating a woman as an object nor merely\nabout dehumanizing her. Sex work is a complex dialectic between\nsubject and object in which a woman\u2019s dehumanization is\nsuccessful precisely because she is perceived as a person whose will,\nseductiveness, and power is properly subordinate to men. (LeMoncheck\n1997: 134)\n\n\nOn this view, pornographic materials and porn consumers recognize\nwomen\u2019s agency while imagining subduing it. Women are thus\nrecognized as subjects with ends of their own and are not depicted as\nmere subhuman objects. Susan Bordo similarly recognizes that women are\nconstructed as subjects in pornography, but she argues that they are\nsubjects whose agency expresses itself only as a desire to please the\nprojected male viewer. She writes\n\n\nan essential ingredient in porn \u2026 is the depiction of a\nsubjectivity (or personality) that willingly contracts its\npossibilities and pleasure to one\u2014the acceptance and\ngratification of the male \u2026 The woman in porn abdicates her\nwill, her sexual discrimination, her independence, but not to become a\nmute body for the man. (Bordo 1994: 276)\n\n\nFor Bordo, there is a mind inside the pornographic female body, but it\ncommunicates only a limited range of nonthreatening desires, and\ntherefore it exists as a truncated self.\n\nShrage contests the Kantian notion that sex is morally problematic\nbecause it inevitably involves using another as a mere instrument. The\nagency of sexual actors does not have a greater potential to immorally\nobjectify others than the agency of employers, consumers, and numerous\nagents who exploit human capacities to achieve their own ends. Shrage\nargues that the use of others involved in pornography is not immorally\nobjectifying as long as consumers and producers respect the ends of\nthe actors and models employed. These ends include the desire to\neconomically benefit from their sexual attractiveness within the\nconventional boundaries set by various genres of sexual representation\nand entertainment. The relationship between porn stars and consumers\nof their work are market relationships and should be held to the norms\nof those relationships, not the norms of friendships and romance\n(Shrage 2005). Similarly, Patricia Marino argues that respect for\nanother\u2019s autonomy and consent are what is crucial for avoiding\nimmoral sexual objectification, and not whether the sexual use is\nmutual or whether it takes place within an ongoing adult relationship.\nA person avoids treating another as a mere object or instrument if he\nis attentive to whether his partner is giving, tacitly or overtly,\nongoing consent to the type of use and the particular instance of it.\nMoreover, the background conditions must be such that the person who\nis used as a means to another\u2019s ends can be judged to be\nvoluntarily and genuinely consenting. When these criteria are met in a\none-sided commercial or casual exchange, then the instrumental use is\nnot immoral (Marino 2008).\n\nJennifer Saul explores the possible connection between\nobjectification\u2014treating people as things\u2014and\npersonification\u2014treating things as people. Saul critiques\nearlier feminist claims that men\u2019s use of pornographic images\ninvolves treating pieces of paper like women, and therefore involves\nconflating women with inanimate instruments (Saul 2006a, 49\u201350).\nMelinda Vadas, for example, argues that the production of objects that\ncan be used, like women, to satisfy sexual appetites places women and\ntheir pornographic substitutes in a single ontological\ncategory\u2014e.g., the category of entities that can arouse and\nsatisfy sexual desire. This reinforces the sexist idea that all that\nfemale and alluring things, whether persons or not, are sexually\nconsumable without consent, or that is, rapeable (Vadas 2005). Saul\nargues that personification and objectification are only linked in\ntroubling ways if some conditions for morally problematic\nobjectification are already met. Saul draws on Rachel Maines\u2019s\nhistorical work on the development of a device now known as the\npersonal vibrator and contends that women\u2019s use of vibrators to\nachieve sexual pleasure and orgasm represents a form of\npersonification. For some women, vibrators eventually replaced a\nservice that had been provided by doctors (and midwives and spas). Yet\nthis is not a troubling form of personification\u2014one linked to\ntroubling forms of objectification\u2014because doctors are not\nlikely to be confused with sex toys as a result of women\u2019s\nmasturbatory use of vibrating technology. Doctors have other\nacknowledged medical uses, as well as ends of their own. Therefore,\nthe transformation of their historical role in treating sexually\nfrustrated (or \u201chysteric\u201d) women, by both new\nunderstandings of women\u2019s reproductive and sexual health and\nadvancements in vibrator technology, does not contribute to the\noppression of doctors. Saul\u2019s discussion of the possible\nequation of people and things, and the background circumstances that\nmay permit this, is useful for considering some new technological\ndevelopments in pornography. New digital imaging and personal computer\ntechnologies enable users to interact and \u201chave sex\u201d with\nplaymate animations on one\u2019s computer screen. Computer-mediated\ninteractions with digitally-simulated but fictional people can\nsometimes be difficult to distinguish from computer-mediated online\ninteractions with real people. Yet such pornographic possibilities do\nnot necessarily involve morally troubling objectification or\npersonification, as long as the social background conditions require\nus to differentiate flesh and blood, non-virtual humans from passive\nobjects and treat the former as subjects, or as active and autonomous\nagents.\n\nNancy Bauer appeals to Beauvoir\u2019s ideas regarding the social\nconstruction of femininity, and suggests that women are to some degree\nresponsible for self-objectification, and are not mere passive agents\nacted upon by men. Bauer critiques contemporary feminist philosophers,\nsuch as Langton, for failing to illuminate contemporary sexual\ncultures and practices in ways that might lead to genuine\nself-criticism and self-awareness. Philosophical speech, like\npornographic speech, is a form of social action, and Bauer\u2019s\nbook urges feminist philosophers to consider what kinds of social\naction they engage in when they offer technical linguistic analyses of\npornography\u2019s influence (Bauer 2015). Do their communicative\nacts serve as action-guiding social commentary, or as theoretical\nexegeses within the insular world of academic philosophy? Can an\nanalysis of pornography\u2019s causal properties tell us what to do\nwith it, or about it?\n\nAnn Cahill argues that the notion of \u2018objectification\u2019 is\nthe wrong tool for analyzing different forms of sex work. Accounts\nthat rely on this concept construe respect for the subjectivity and\nautonomy of persons as a moral duty, while treating a person as a\nphysical thing or a body is morally impermissible. In this way, such\naccounts privilege the mind over the body, and treat the bodily\ncomponents of the self as less important or dignified. Feminists and\nother moral theorists whose critiques of sex work build on the alleged\nwrongs of objectifying persons cannot \u201cexplain how the\nexperience of being treated as a sexually appealing body can actually\nenhance rather than undermine one\u2019s sense of self\u201d (Cahill\n2014: 842). Cahill proposes that we degrade others when we recognize\nin another subject only those aspects of their subjectivity important\nto ourselves. \u201cDerivatized subjects\u201d are often reduced to\nthe roles they fulfill for another subject (e.g., waiter, mother,\netc.), and are only valued for the traits suitable to these roles.\nDerivatization degrades people not by treating them as a mere body,\nbut by treating people such that their subjective qualities and\nidentities are determined by the needs of others. Cahill contends that\nsex work is problematic when it involves derivatizing sex workers\n(defining them in terms of the demands of their clients), but that sex\nwork does not inherently involve this kind of degradation. She\nsuggests that derivatization is especially morally problematic when it\nreflects and reproduces unjust social privileges.\n",
