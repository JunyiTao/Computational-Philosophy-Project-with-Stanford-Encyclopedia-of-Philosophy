    "main_text": "Creatures\n4. Creatures\n\nAll creatures, humans, animals, plants and minerals, consist of\ncomposites of spirit and body (in Conway\u2019s sense), each of which\ncontains infinite numbers of other creatures, compounded, in their\nturn of infinite creatures. All creatures interact and\ninter-communicate by means of the emanation of spirits (even the most\ndense bodies, produce and emit other, finer, or more subtle spirits).\nCreatures are, furthermore subject to change. These changes can be\nradical\u2014body can become spirit and vice versa, while creatures\ncan metamorphose into other creatures, up or down the scale of nature.\nCreaturely change takes the form of reconfigurations or as it were\nre-balancing of the constituent corporeal and spiritual elements that\nmake-up a particular creature. This reflects the relative goodness of\nthe creature, such that the more good, and therefore more godlike a\ncreature becomes, the more spiritual its make-up. This is manifest in\nterms of its increase or loss of capacity for action\u2014the more\nspiritual a creature, the more volatile and more able to act\n(\u201cactive and operative\u201d) and vice versa.\n\nThe mutable state of creatures raises the question of how far a\ncreature can change and still be the same individual thing?\nConway\u2019s answer is that outwardly every creature may change\nradically, though not to such an extent that it exceeds the\nontological boundaries of the third species/created nature (e.g., by\nacquiring the attributes of a higher species, God or Christ, or losing\nthe attribute of life). Creaturely change occurs across successive\nlife-times, rather than in the course of a single life span. The\nidentity of a creature is not co-terminous with its natural life span,\nbut persists throughout its existence in time. Thus a horse (to use\nthe example she gives) may transform into a human being through\nincremental changes across in successive life spans. But its identity\nas a living being persists through these changes. Conway explains\nexplains the continuous identity of an individual creature from one\nstate to another and across time, partly through her conception of the\ncomposition of living creatures, which are structured as organized\norderly composites, the unity of which is sustained by a dominant\nspirit: \n\n\nthe unity of the spirits composing this spirit is\u2026so great that\nnothing can dissolve it\u2026thus it happens that the soul of every\nhuman being will remain a whole soul for eternity.\n(Principles, VII.4; see Thomas 2017, Hutton 2004). \n\n\nThis \u201ccaptain spirit\u201d, determines the moral constitution\nof the creature, and its continuous identity across time, throughout\nthe metamorphoses which the creature undergoes. Another limit on\ncreaturely change is that an individual creature cannot transform into\nanother individual (Peter cannot become Paul, or Judas). The reason\nfor this rests with divine justice: it would be unjust for Peter to be\nrewarded for Paul\u2019s righteousness, or for Peter to be punished\nfor the sins of Judas.\n",
