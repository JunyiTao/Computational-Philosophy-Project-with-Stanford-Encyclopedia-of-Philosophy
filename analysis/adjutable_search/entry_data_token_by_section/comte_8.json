The System of Positive Polity and the Complete Positivism\n\nSoon after finishing the Course, Comte returned to his\ninitial project and began outlining the System of Positive\nPolity. The Discourse on the Positive Spirit, which had\nserved as the preface to the Philosophical Treatise on Popular\nAstronomy (1844), had already emphasized the social purpose of\npositivism and its aptitude to replace theology in politics and\nmorality. But his encounter with Clotilde de Vaux would turn his life\nupside down and give Comte\u2019s second career an unexpected twist\n(1845\u20131846).\n",
