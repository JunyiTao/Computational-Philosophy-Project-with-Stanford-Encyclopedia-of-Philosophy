    "main_text": "Physics: The Critical Period (Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science) || Phoronomy\n2.2 Phoronomy\n\nThe first chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations, the\nPhoronomy, considers the quantity of motion of matter and how it is to\nbe constructed in intuition a priori (so as to produce the kind of\nrules that are necessary for our experience of matter in motion).\nSince extension and impenetrability are not directly relevant to how\ndifferent magnitudes (or degrees) of motion can be represented, Kant\nrestricts his discussion in this chapter to matter considered as a\npoint. Since the motion of a point in space can be represented\nstraightforwardly, the main issue is how to represent the composition\nof two different motions. Kant\u2019s primary claim in this chapter\nis that due to the relativity of space (i.e., the fact that every\nmotion can be viewed arbitrarily as either the motion of a body in a\nspace at rest, or as a body in a state of rest in a space which is in\nmotion in the opposite direction with the same velocity) \u201cthe\ncomposition of two motions of one and the same point can only be\nthought in such a way that one of them is represented in absolute\nspace, and, instead of the other, a motion of the relative space with\nthe same speed occurring in the opposite direction is represented as\nthe same as the latter\u201d (4:490). The proof of this Theorem\nconsiders the three possible cases for the composition of two motions:\n(i) The two motions are in the same direction; (ii) the two motions\nare in opposite directions; (iii) the two motions enclose an angle.\nKant then shows how one can construct a priori in intuition a single\nmotion out of the two motions described in cases (i)-(iii). The\nsynthetic a priori outcome of this constructive procedure is a\ncomposition theorem that covers two fundamental results of classical\nphysics: the parallelogram rule for velocity addition, and the\nGalilean kinematic transformations. The theorem is needed for\narchitectonic reasons too, not just as a foundation for science. Kant\nuses the composition theorem as a premise in his Dynamics, so as to\ninfer a priori to forces from the composite motions they cause (e.g.,\n4:497). And, he invokes the theorem explicitly in his Mechanics, in\nthe course of \u201cconstructing the communication of motion,\u201d\ni.e. deriving the laws of impact (4:546).\n\nUntil recently, very little has been written directly on Kant\u2019s\nPhoronomy. Pollok (2001) is a historically rich commentary. Friedman\n(2013) untangles the complex strands of thought in Kant\u2019s\nchapter. His leading idea is that Kant\u2019s categories of quantity\n(of the First Critique) guarantee that motion is a magnitude, hence\nmathematics is applicable to the motions of bodies\u2014as\nkinematics. Two chapters (by Dunlop and Stan, respectively) in McNulty\n2022 add to our understanding of this aspect in Kant\u2019s\nthought.\n",
