    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy\n6. Moral Philosophy\n\n\nWhereas Reid wrote an entire book about perception, Inquiry into\nthe Human Mind, his moral theory arrives to us piecemeal in\nthe Active Powers, the Intellectual Powers and\npapers collected as Reid's Practical Ethics, alongside a\nnumber of other concerns about free will, agency, causation, etc. As a\nresult, Reid's readers must do more work to structure his moral\nphilosophy than other components of his system.\n\n\nReid's moral philosophy is composed of several core theses. These\ninclude: (i) that human beings have an active power that is not\ncausally determined by prior causes, laws of nature, or the\nconjunction of the two, making Reid a libertarian about free will;\n(ii) that moral statements are to be interpreted as propositions with\nsubject/object content, making Reid a cognitivist; (iii) that\ntruth-makers for moral statements are non-natural and independent of\nthe mental states of human beings, meaning that truths in ethics do\nnot generally depend upon the beliefs of humans; and (iv) that moral\nknowledge is produced in a way structurally similar to knowledge of\nthe external world through perception, making Reid a moral sense\ntheorist. Reid's moral philosophy is influenced by his belief in a\nbenevolent, just, Christian God, but Reid doesn't endorse divine\ncommand theory. Reid summarizes his ethics in the familiar terms of\nhis philosophical method by saying that\nby an original power of the mind, which we call\nconscience, or the moral faculty, we have the conceptions of right and\nwrong in human conduct, of merit and demerit, of duty and moral\nobligation, ...; and that by the same faculty, we perceive some things\nin human conduct to be right, and others to be wrong; that the first\nprinciples of morals are the dictates of this faculty; and that we\nhave the same reason to rely upon those dictates, as upon the\ndeterminations of our senses, or of our other natural faculties. (EAP\n3.3.6, 180)\n\n\nReid's theory faces common criticisms about the plausibility of moral\nsense theory. The internal structure of Reid's moral philosophy has\nled to criticisms about, for example, the relation between the moral\nsense and moral first principles. It is unclear how the moral faculty\njudges either the truth of universalized moral first principles or the\ntruth of contingent and fallible statements about particular action\ntokens. Reid appears to use the term \u2018axiom\u2019 equivocally by referring\nboth to general and particular moral principles (Haakonssen\n1990). However, promising steps to a full understanding of the\ninterpretive problems posed by the logical scope and status of\nparticular and general forms of Reid's first principles have been\nmade, even though they await application to Reid's moral theory.\n",
