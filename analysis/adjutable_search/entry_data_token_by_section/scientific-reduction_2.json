Kemeny and Oppenheim (1956) regard the idea that\nreductions somehow relate to scientific progress as being crucial for\nunderstanding reduction:\n\n\nThe label \u2018reduction\u2019 has been applied to a certain type\nof progress in science. As this process has been the subject of much\nphilosophical controversy, it is the task of the philosophers of\nscience to give a rational reconstruction of the essential features of\nreduction. [\u2026] Scientific progress may broadly be divided into\ntwo types: (1) an increase in factual knowledge, by the addition to\nthe total amount of scientific observations; (2) an improvement in the\nbody of theories, which is designed to explain the known facts and to\npredict the outcome of future observations. An especially important\ncase of the second type is the replacement of an accepted theory (or\nbody of theories) by a new theory (or body of theories) which is in\nsome sense superior to it. Reduction is an improvement in this sense.\n(Kemeny & Oppenheim 1956: 6f.)\n\n\nAccording to this use of the term, reduction is a relation of actual\ntheory-succession, such that reductions happen at a certain time,\nnamely, when scientists did bring it about. Often, philosophers employ\nthe term \u2018reduction\u2019 in this sense, thereby designating an\nactivity of scientists, or the outcome of such an activity. Whether or\nnot a theory actually becomes the successor of another theory will\ndepend not only on logical and metaphysical features of the respective\ntheories, but also on pragmatic and epistemic aspects. The most\nrelevant of these aspects are to be captured in a rational\nreconstruction, which plays a major role in some models of\nreduction.\n\nWhen discussing the status of bridge-principles (intuitively,\nstatements that connect the vocabulary of the reducing theory to the\nreduced theory), Ernest Nagel suggested that they might play different\nroles in the discovery of reductions than in after the fact\nanalyses. They may function as hypotheses to be tested, or they may\nrely on empirical evidence already gathered. Similarly, Kenneth\nSchaffner suggests that an appropriate model of reduction should take\ninto account not only logical or metaphysical aspects regarding the\nreduced and the reducing theory. Rather, it should also be sensitive\nto pragmatic and epistemic aspects underlying the actions of\nscientists who carry out reductions (Schaffner 1993: 515f.)\u2014an\nidea he labels \u2018logical pragmatism\u2019. New Wave\nreductionists criticized other models, especially Nagel\u2019s, for\nnot being adequately sensitive to how reductions are actually carried\nout, a point also made by Ager, Aronson, and Weingard (1974).\n\nThe distinction between reduction as an activity and reduction as a\nrelation that is independent of what scientists actually do is\ntentatively captured by the distinction between diachronic\nand synchronic reduction.\n\nThe main idea of diachronic reduction is not merely that reduction is\na temporal affair but that they consist in the replacement of\none theory by another theory, such that one theory (the reducing one)\nbecomes the successor of the reduced theory (Dupr\u00e9 1993;\nRosenberg 2006). It is also often described as a sort of\ntheory-improvement or scientific progress: particularly one in which\nthe laws of the prior theory apply to a proper subset of the cases\ncovered by the laws of the succeeding theory (Dizadji Bahmani et al.\n2010).\n\nThe notion of reduction as a scientific activity, or as an event of\nscientific change, is discussed in the entries\n scientific revolutions\n and\n scientific progress.\n The remainder of this entry will deal with \u201csynchronic\u201d\naspects of reduction.\n",
