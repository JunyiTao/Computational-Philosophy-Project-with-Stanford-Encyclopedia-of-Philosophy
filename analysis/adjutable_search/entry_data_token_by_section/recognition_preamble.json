    "main_text": "\n\n\nRecognition has both a normative and a psychological\ndimension. Arguably, if you recognize another person with regard to a\ncertain feature, as an autonomous agent, for example, you do not only\nadmit that she has this feature but you embrace a positive attitude\ntowards her for having this feature. Such recognition implies that you\nbear obligations to treat her in a certain way, that is, you recognize\na specific normative status of the other person, e.g., as a free and\nequal person.  But recognition does not only matter normatively. It is\nalso of psychological importance. Most theories of recognition assume\nthat in order to develop a practical identity, persons fundamentally\ndepend on the feedback of other subjects (and of society as a\nwhole). According to this view, those who fail to experience adequate\nrecognition, i.e., those who are depicted by the surrounding others or\nthe societal norms and values in a one-sided or negative way, will\nfind it much harder to embrace themselves and their projects as\nvaluable. Misrecognition thereby hinders or destroys persons\u2019\nsuccessful relationship to their selves. It has been poignantly\ndescribed how the victims of racism and colonialism have suffered\nsevere psychological harm by being demeaned as inferior humans (Fanon\n1952). Thus, recognition constitutes a \u201cvital human need\u201d\n(Taylor 1992, 26).\n\n\nRecognition theory is thought to be especially well-equipped to\nilluminate the psychological mechanisms of social and political\nresistance. As experiences of misrecognition violate the identity of\nsubjects, the affected are supposed to be particularly motivated to\nresist, that is, to engage in a \u201cstruggle for recognition.\u201d\nTherefore, at least since the 1990s, theories of recognition have\nenjoyed a lively academic as well as public interest. They promise to\nilluminate a variety of new social movements\u2014be it the\nstruggles of ethnic or religious minorities, of gays and lesbians or of\npeople with disabilities. None of these groups primarily fight for a\nmore favorable distribution of goods. Rather, they struggle for an\naffirmation of their particular identity and are thus thought\nto be engaged in a new form of politics, sometimes labeled\n\u201cpolitics of difference\u201d or \u201cidentity\npolitics.\u201d However, many accounts want to ascribe a much more\nfundamental role to the concept of recognition\u2014covering the\nmorality of human relationships in its entirety. From this more general\nperspective, also earlier campaigns for equal rights\u2014be it by\nworkers, women or African Americans\u2014should be understood as\n\u201cstruggles for recognition.\u201d To frame these political\nmovements in terms of recognition highlights the relational character\nof morality\u2014and justice: Justice is not primarily concerned\nwith how many goods a person should have but rather with what kind of\nstanding vis-\u00e0-vis other persons she deserves (Young 1990).\n\n\nThis entry will first discuss some controversies surrounding the\nvery concept of recognition (1) before reviewing four dimensions of\nwhat is recognized (by whom and on what\ngrounds) that have been highlighted by different theories of\nrecognition (2). However, even in light of these differentiations some\nauthors have expressed the fear that concentrating on the issue of\nrecognition might supplant the central problem of (re)distribution on\nthe political agenda (3). Finally, the often rather sanguine\ndescriptions of recognition and its potential for emancipation (4)\nhave been fundamentally challenged: The concern is that because the\nneed for recognition renders persons utterly dependent on the\ndominating societal norms it may undermine the identity of any critic. Thus, some worry that struggles for recognition may lead to\nconformism and a strengthening of ideological formations (5).\n",
