    "main_text": "Game Theory and Behavioral Evidence || Neuroeconomics and Game Theory\n8.2 Neuroeconomics and Game Theory\n\nThe idea that game theory can find novel application to the internal\ndynamics of brains, as suggested in the previous section, has been\ndeveloped from independent motivations by the research program known\nas neuroeconomics\n (Montague and Berns 2002,\n Glimcher 2003,\n Ross 2005a,\n pp. 320\u2013334,\n Camerer, Loewenstein and Prelec 2005).\n Thanks to new non-invasive scanning technologies, especially\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it has recently become\npossible to study synaptic activity in working brains while they\nrespond to controlled cues. This has allowed a new path of\naccess\u2014though still a highly indirect one\n (Harrison and Ross 2010)\u2014\n to the brain\u2019s computation of expected values of rewards, which\nare (naturally) taken to play a crucial role in determining behavior.\nEconomic theory is used to frame the derivation of the functions\nmaximized by synaptic-level computation of these expected values;\nhence the name \u2018neuroeconomics\u2019.\n\nGame theory plays a leading role in neuroeconomics at two levels.\nFirst, game theory has been used to predict the computations that\nindividual neurons and groups of neurons serving the reward system\nmust perform. In the best publicized example,\n Glimcher (2003)\n and colleagues have fMRI-scanned monkeys they had trained to play\nso-called \u2018inspection games\u2019 against computers. In an\ninspection game, one player faces a series of choices either to work\nfor a reward, in which case he is sure to receive it, or to perform\nanother, easier action (\u201cshirking\u201d), in which case he will\nreceive the reward only if the other player (the\n\u201cinspector\u201d) is not monitoring him. Assume that the first\nplayer\u2019s (the \u201cworker\u2019s\u201d) behavior reveals a\nutility function bounded on each end as follows: he will work on every\noccasion if the inspector always monitors and he will shirk on every\noccasion if the inspector never monitors. The inspector prefers to\nobtain the highest possible amount of work for the lowest possible\nmonitoring rate. In this game, the only NE for both players are in\nmixed strategies, since any pattern in one player\u2019s strategy\nthat can be detected by the other can be exploited. For any given pair\nof specific utility functions for the two players meeting the\nconstraints described above, any pair of strategies in which, on each\ntrial, either the worker is indifferent between working and shirking\nor the inspector is indifferent between monitoring and not monitoring,\nis a NE.\n\nApplying inspection game analyses to pairs or groups of agents\nrequires us to have either independently justified their\nutility functions over all variables relevant to their play, in which\ncase we can define NE and then test to see whether they successfully\nmaximize expected utility; or to assume that they maximize\nexpected utility, or obey some other rule such as a matching function,\nand then infer their utility functions from their behavior. Either\nsuch procedure can be sensible in different empirical contexts. But\nepistemological leverage increases greatly if the utility function of\nthe inspector is exogenously determined, as it often is. (Police\nimplementing random roadside inspections to catch drunk drivers, for\nexample, typically have a maximum incidence of drunk driving assigned\nto them as a target by policy, and an exogenously set budget. These\ndetermine their utility function, given a distribution of preferences\nand attitudes to risk among the population of drivers.) In the case of\nGlimcher\u2019s experiments the inspector is a computer, so its\nprogram is under experimental control and its side of the payoff\nmatrix is known. Proxies for the subjects\u2019 expected utility, in\nthis case squirts of fruit juice for the monkeys, can be antecedently\ndetermined in parametric test settings. The computer is then\nprogrammed with the economic model of the monkeys, and can search the\ndata in their behavior in game conditions for exploitable patterns,\nvarying its strategy accordingly. With these variables fixed,\nexpected-utility-maximizing NE behavior by the monkeys can be\ncalculated and tested by manipulating the computer\u2019s utility\nfunction in various runs of the game.\n\nMonkey behavior after training tracks NE very robustly (as does the\nbehavior of people playing similar games for monetary prizes;\n Glimcher 2003,\n pp. 307\u2013308). Working with trained monkeys, Glimcher and\ncolleagues could then perform the experiments of significance here.\nWorking and shirking behaviors for the monkeys had been associated by\ntheir training with staring either to the right or to the left on a\nvisual display. In earlier experiments,\n Platt and Glimcher (1999)\n had established that, in parametric settings, as juice rewards varied\nfrom one block of trials to another, firing rates of each parietal\nneuron that controls eye movements could be trained to encode the\nexpected utility to the monkey of each possible movement relative to\nthe expected utility of the alternative movement. Thus\n\u201cmovements that were worth 0.4 ml of juice were represented\ntwice as strongly [in neural firing probabilities] as movements worth\n0.2 ml of juice\u201d (p. 314). Unsurprisingly, when amounts of juice\nrewarded for each movement were varied from one block of trials to\nanother, firing rates also varied.\n\nAgainst this background, Glimcher and colleagues could investigate the\nway in which monkeys\u2019 brains implemented the tracking of NE.\nWhen the monkeys played the inspection game against the computer, the\ntarget associated with shirking could be set at the optimal location,\ngiven the prior training, for a specific neuron under study, while the\nwork target would appear at a null location. This permitted Glimcher\nto test the answer to the following question: did the monkeys maintain\nNE in the game by keeping the firing rate of the neuron constant while\nthe actual and optimal behavior of the monkey as a whole varied? The\ndata robustly gave the answer \u2018yes\u2019. Glimcher reasonably\ninterprets these data as suggesting that neural firing rates, at least\nin this cortical region for this task, encode expected utility in both\nparametric and nonparametric settings. Here we have an apparent\nvindication of the empirical applicability of classical game theory in\na context independent of institutions or social conventions.\n\nFurther analysis pushed the hypothesis deeper. The computer playing\nInspector was presented with the same sequence of outcomes as its\nmonkey opponent had received on the previous day\u2019s play, and for\neach move was asked to assess the relative expected values of the\nshirking and working actions available on the next move. Glimcher\nreports a positive correlation between small fluctuations around the\nstable NE firing rates in the individual neuron and the expected\nvalues estimated by the computer trying to track the same NE. Glimcher\ncomments on this finding as follows:\n\nThe neurons seemed to be reflecting, on a play-by-play basis, a\ncomputation close to the one performed by our computer \u2026 [A]t a\n\u2026 [relatively] \u2026 microscopic scale, we were able to use\ngame theory to begin to describe the decision-by-decision computations\nthat the neurons in area LIP were performing.\n (Glimcher 2003,\n p. 317)\n\n\nThus we find game theory reaching beyond its traditional role as a\ntechnology for framing high-level constraints on evolutionary dynamics\nor on behavior by well-informed agents operating in institutional\nstraitjackets. In Glimcher\u2019s hands, it is used to directly model\nactivity in a monkey\u2019s brain.\n Ross (2005a)\n argues that groups of neurons thus modeled should not be identified\nwith the sub-personal game-playing units found in Ainslie\u2019s\ntheory of intra-personal bargaining described earlier; that would\ninvolve a kind of straightforward reduction that experience in the\nbehavioral and life sciences has taught us not to expect. This issue\nhas since arisen in a direct dispute between neuroeconomists over\nrival interpretations of fMRI observations of intertemporal choice and\ndiscounting\n (McClure et al. 2004),\n Glimcher et al. 2007). The weight of evidence so far favors the view that if\nit is sometimes useful to analyze people\u2019s choices as equilibria\nin games amongst sub-personal agents, the sub-personal agents in\nquestion should not be identified with separate brain areas. The\nopposite interpretation is unfortunately still most common in less\nspecialized literature. \n\nWe have now seen the first level at which neuroeconomics applies game\ntheory. A second level involves seeking conditioning variables in\nneural activity that might impact people\u2019s choices of strategies\nwhen they play games. This has typically involved repeating protocols\nfrom the behavioral game theory literature with research subjects who\nare lying in fMRI scanners during play.\n Harrison (2008)\n and\n Ross (2008b)\n have argued for skepticism about the value of work of this kind,\nwhich involves various uncomfortably large leaps of inference in\nassociating the observed behavior with specific imputed neural\nresponses. It can also be questioned whether much generalizable new\nknowledge is gained to the extent that such associations can\nbe successfully identified.\n\nLet us provide an example of this kind of \u201cgame in a\nscanner\u201d\u2014that directly involves strategic interaction.\n King-Casas et al. (2005)\n took a standard protocol from behavioral game theory, the so-called\n\u2018trust\u2019 game, and implemented it with subjects whose\nbrains were jointly scanned using a technology for linking the\nfunctional maps of their respective brains, known as\n\u2018hyperscanning\u2019). This game involves two players. In its\nrepeated format as used in the King-Casas et al. experiment,\nthe first player is designated the \u2018investor\u2019 and the\nsecond the \u2018trustee\u2019. The investor begins with $20, of\nwhich she can keep any portion of her choice while investing the\nremainder with the trustee. In the trustee\u2019s hands the invested\namount is tripled by the experimenter. The trustee may then return as\nmuch or as little of this profit to the investor as he deems fit. The\nprocedure is run for ten rounds, with players\u2019 identities kept\nanonymous from one another.\n\nThis game has an infinite number of NE. Previous data from behavioral\neconomics are consistent with the claim that the modal NE in human\nplay approximates both players using\n\u2018Tit-for-tat\u2019 strategies (see\n Section 4)\n modified by occasional defections to probe for information, and some\npost-defection cooperation that manifests (limited) toleration of such\nprobes. This is a very weak result, since it is compatible with a wide\nrange of hypotheses on exactly which variations of Tit-for-tat are\nused and sustained, and thus licenses no inferences about potential\ndynamics under different learning conditions, institutions, or\ncross-cultural transfers.\n\nWhen they ran this game under hyperscanning, the researchers\ninterpreted their observations as follows. Neurons in the\ntrustee\u2019s caudate nucleus (generally thought to implement\ncomputations or outputs of midbrain dopaminergic systems) were thought\nto show strong response when investors benevolently reciprocated\ntrust\u2014that is, responded to defection with increased generosity.\nAs the game progressed, these responses were believed to have shifted\nfrom being reactionary to being anticipatory. Thus reputational\nprofiles as predicted by classical game-theoretic models were inferred\nto have been constructed directly by the brain. A further aspect of\nthe findings not predictable by theoretical modeling alone, and which\npurely behavioral observation had not been sufficient to discriminate,\nwas taken to be that responses by the caudate neurons to malevolent\nreciprocity\u2014that is, reduced generosity in response to\ncooperation\u2014were significantly smaller in amplitude. This was\nhypothesized to be a mechanism by which the brain implements\nmodification of Tit-for-tat so as to prevent occasional defections for\ninformational probing from unraveling cooperation permanently. \n\nThe advance in understanding for which practitioners of this style of\nneuroeconomics hope consists not in what it tells us about particular\ntypes of games, but rather in comparative inferences it facilitates\nabout the ways in which contextual framing influences people\u2019s\nconjectures about which games they\u2019re playing. fMRI or other\nkinds of probes of working brains might, it is conjectured, enable us\nto quantitatively estimate degrees of strategic surprise.\nReciprocally interacting expectations about surprise may themselves be\nsubject to strategic manipulation, but this is an idea that has barely\nbegun to be theoretically explored by game theorists (see\n Ross and Dumouchel 2004).\n The view of some neuroeconomists that we now have the prospect of\nempirically testing such new theories, as opposed to just\nhypothetically modeling them, has stimulated growth in this line of\nresearch.\n",
