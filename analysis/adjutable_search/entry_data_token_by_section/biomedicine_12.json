Alternative Frameworks\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this entry, critiques of biomedicine tend\nto focus on elements of biomedicine rather than the whole. There are\nexceptions to this. This section will review some of the frameworks\nthat have been offered in place of biomedicine, though they vary in\nhow similar they remain to the biomedical framework. Before delving\ninto the alternative frameworks, it is important to discuss two\nprominent critiques of biomedicine that are influential primarily as\nholistic criticisms and not so much as sources of alternative visions\nof what ought to be offered in place of biomedicine.\n\nMichel Foucault\u2019s\n work, and use of the concepts biopower and biopolitics, remain\ntouchstones for much of the critical discourse surrounding\nbiomedicine. Foucault\u2019s critique of modern medicine is part of a\ncareer critiquing other aspects of modernity, including the related\ntopic of psychiatry. His famous work The Birth of the Clinic\nis written as a history, though in the process it highlighted aspects\nof biomedicine that other scholars went on to critique as well, either\nbased on his critique or in parallel to it: dehumanization,\nreductionism, measurement and observation methods of dubious value,\nand the problem of the biomedicine\u2019s institutional power\n(Foucault 1963 [2002]).\n\nIvan Illich\u2019s Medical Nemesis is perhaps the most\ninfluential critique of biomedicine (Illich 1976). It combines\ncritiques of (bio)medicine for failing at its own goals (iatrogenic\ndisease\u2014harms caused by medical treatment\u2014are a large\ncomponent) and for having the wrong goals in the first place (he\nvalorizes death, disease, and pain as proper components of the human\nexperience rather than enemies to be automatically and constantly\nopposed).\n",
