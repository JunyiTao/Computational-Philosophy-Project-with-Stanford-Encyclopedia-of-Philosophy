    "main_text": "Are zombies conceivable? || Arguments for the conceivability of zombies\n4.1 Arguments for the conceivability of zombies\n\nChalmers (1996) set out five arguments against the view that there is\nan a priori entailment from physical facts to mental facts\n\u2014 and so for the view that zombies are conceivable.\nEach argument would directly or indirectly reinforce the intuitive\nappeal of the zombie idea. The first will be considered shortly; the\nother four appeal respectively to the alleged possibility of\n\u2018inverted spectrum\u2019 without physical difference; the\nalleged impossibility of learning about conscious experience on the\nbasis of purely physical information; Jackson\u2019s (1982)\n\u2018knowledge argument\u2019 (related to the last); and what\nChalmers calls \u2018the absence of analysis\u2019: the point being\nthat his opponents \u2018will have to give us some idea of\nhow the existence of consciousness might be entailed by the\nphysical facts\u2019, when (assuming the other arguments work)\n\u2018any attempt to demonstrate such an entailment is doomed to\nfailure\u2019 (1996, p. 104). \n\nHis first argument goes roughly as follows. Suppose a population of\ntiny people disable your brain and replicate its functions themselves,\nwhile keeping the rest of your body in working order (see Block\n1980a); each homunculus uses a cell phone to perform the\nsignal-receiving and -transmitting functions of an individual neuron.\nWould such a system be conscious? Intuitively one may be inclined to\nsay not. Some, notably functionalists, bite the bullet and answer yes.\nHowever, the argument does not depend on assuming that the\nhomunculus-head would not be conscious. It depends only on the\nassumption that its not being conscious is conceivable\n\u2014 which many people find reasonable. In Chalmers\u2019s words,\nall that matters here is that when we say the system might lack\nconsciousness, \u2018a meaningful possibility is being expressed, and\nit is an open question whether consciousness arises or not\u2019\n(1996, p. 97). If he is right, then conceivably the system is not\nconscious. In that case it is already very much like a zombie, the\nonly difference being that it has little people where a zombie has\nneurons. And why should that make a difference to whether the\nsituation is conceivable? Why should switching from homunculi to\nneurons necessarily switch on the light of consciousness? (For doubts\nabout the assumption that it is conceivable that the homunculus-head\nlacks consciousness, see e.g. Loar 1990/1997, pp. 613f.)\n\nOther considerations favoring the conceivability of zombies can be\nfound in Block 1995, 2002; Levine 2001; Searle 1992. Chalmers 2010\ndevelops his defense further. Brian Cutter 2020 offers an\nanti-materialist modal argument which does not rely on the assumption\nthat the physical truths are compatible with the absence of\nconsciousness.\n",
