    "main_text": "Tsongkhapa's Life || Detailed account\n1.2 Detailed account\n\nThe name Tsongkhapa derives from Tsong kha, an ancient name for a part\nof the A mdo region of Greater Tibet (Bod chen) now included\nin Qinghai Province of the People's Republic of China, and the Tibetan\nsuffix pa that works as an agentive nominalizing particle.\nHis given name is Losang (sometimes written Lozang) Drakpa (bLo\nbzang grags pa). He is also known by the honorific title Je\nRinpoche (rJe rin po che) (\u201cPrecious Lord\u201d). He\nwas born, probably to semi-nomadic farmers, in a settlement now\nincorporated into the outskirts of the Chinese city of Xi ning. His\nbirthplace is marked by the popular Kumbum (sKu 'bum)\nmonastery,\n\nIn his teens (1372\u201373), Tsongkhapa travelled from Tsong kha to\nCentral (dBus) Tibet (Bod) where he remained until\nhis death in 1419. He arrived as a young man in Central Tibet at the\nend of a long flowering of intellectual activity called \u201cthe\nlater diffusion [of Buddhism]\u201d (Tib. spyi dar) that\nbegan with translator Rin chen bzang po (958\u20131055) and the\nscholar-saint D\u012bpa\u1e43k\u0101ra-\u015br\u012bj\u00f1\u0101na\nAti\u015ba (980\u20131054), and ended with the most important editor\nof the Kanjur, But\u00f6n (Bu ston Rin chen grub),\n(1290\u20131364).\n\nAccording to Kedrup, on his arrival in Central Tibet Tsongkhapa first\nstudied Tibetan medicine, then a traditional Buddhist curriculum of\nabhidharma, tenet systems (Tib. grub mtha') focusing\non the Middle Way and Mind Only (Sk. cittam\u0101tra also\ncalled yog\u0101c\u0101ra) philosophy, Buddhist ethics (Tib.\nsdom gsum), and epistemology (Sk.\npram\u0101\u1e47a). His early studies were pursued mainly in\ninstitutions affiliated with the two dominant scholarly traditions\n(Tib. lugs) of the time: the Sangphu (gSang phu ne'u\ntog) tradition founded by Ngok (rNgog bLo ldan shes rab)\n(1059\u20131109), and the Sakya (Sa skya) epistemological\ntradition based primarily on the works of the Sa skya\npa\u1e47\u1e0di ta (1182\u20131251). He also studied and practiced\ntantric Buddhism.\n\nIn his early years he wrote a number of essays on topics in\nabhidharma (Apple 2008), a detailed investigation of the\n\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na (Sk.) (\u201cfoundation,\nstorehouse, basis-of all consciousness\u201d) (Sparham 1993), and an\nimportant treatise, Golden Garland (Legs bshad gser\nphreng), on the Perfection of Wisdom (Sk.\npraj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101) literature based on\nthe codification of its topics in the Ornament for the Clear\nRealizations (Abhisamay\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra)\n(Sparham 2007\u20132013).\n\nAfter completing his Golden Garland in 1388\u201389,\nTsongkhapa spent a period of some ten years removed from the hub of\nintellectual activity. He engaged in meditation and ritual religious\nexercises in Southern Tibet (Lho kha) where, as evidenced in\nhis short autobiographical writing from this transitional period\n(Thurman 1982), and corroborated by traditional sources (Kaschewsky\n1971, Vostrikov 1970), he resorted to a communion or dialogue with\nMa\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b\u2013\u2013the iconographic representation\nof perfect knowledge in the Buddhist pantheon. Through the voice of\nMa\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b he articulated a hierarchical system of\nphilosophies culminating in what he characterized as a pristine,\nMiddle Way, *Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika-madhyamaka (Tib. dBu ma thal\n'gyur pa) that avoided over-reification (of the absolute) and\nover-negation (of the conventional).\n\nTsongkhapa framed his insights not as original contributions, but as a\nrediscovery of meanings already revealed by the Buddha. In all his\nworks he characterizes his philosophy as identical to the Buddha's.\nFurther, he says his philosophy is based on N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's and\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna's follower \u0100ryadeva's (third-fourth century)\nexplanation of what the Buddha said. His philosophy gets its name\n*Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika (\u201cthose who reveal the unwelcome\nconsequences [inherent in other's assertions]\u201d) from the\nimportance it gives to Buddhap\u0101lita's (late fifth century)\nexplication of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's work, and to Candrak\u012brti's\ndefense of Buddhap\u0101lita's explanation, in the face of criticism\nby Bh\u0101viveka.\n\nTsongkhapa presented his mature philosophy in a series of volumes\nduring the later period of his life, beginning with the publication of\nhis most famous work, the Great Exposition of the Stages of the\nPath (Lam rim chen mo) in 1402, at the age of 46. This\nwas followed by Essence of Eloquence (Legs bshad snying\npo) and Ocean of Reasoning (Rigs pa'i rgya\nmtsho) (1407\u20131408), the Medium-Length Exposition of the\nStages of the Path (Lam rim 'bring) in 1415, and, in the\nlast years of his life, his Elucidation of the Intention\n(dGongs pa rab gsal).\n\nTogether, in this series of works written over a seventeen year\nperiod, he succeeded in setting the agenda for the following\ncenturies, to a great extent, with later writers taking positions pro\nand con his arguments. As is so often the case, his stature pushed\nmuch of earlier Tibetan intellectual history into the shadows, until\nits rediscovery by the Eclectic Movement (Tib. Ris med) in\nDerge (sDe dge) in the late 18th century.\n\nTsongkhapa wrote his major works on tantra and ethics at the same time\nas his major philosophical works. Volumes 3\u201312 of his collected\nworks in 18 or 19 volumes deal exclusively with topics based on\ntantric sources. In 1405 he completed his Great Exposition of\nTantra (sNgags rim chen mo) (Hopkins 1980, Yarnall 2013)\na companion volume to his Great Exposition, where, in harmony\nwith his philosophy, he argued that tantra is defined neither by\nspecial insight (Sk. vipa\u015byana) or Mah\u0101y\u0101na\naltruism (Sk. bodhicitta), but solely by deity yoga (Tib.\nlha'i rnal 'byor) (Hopkins 1980).\n\nIn 1402, Tsongkhapa, with his teacher Rendawa (Red mda' ba gzhon\nnu blo gros), (1349\u20131412) (Roloff 2009) and others, at the\ntemple of Namstedeng (rNam rtsed ldeng/lding)\nconvened a gathering of monks with the intention of reinvigorating the\nBuddhist order. From this came Tsongkhapa's short, but influential\nworks on basic Buddhist morality (Sk. pr\u0101timok\u1e63a)\nthat in turn laid the foundation for the importance some Gelukpa\nmonasteries would place on a stricter adherence to the monastic code.\nIn 1403 his influential works on ethical codes for bodhisattvas\n(Byang chub gzhung lam) (Tatz 1987) and for tantric\npractitioners (rTsa ltung rnam bshad) (Sparham 2005)\nappeared. His separate explanations of the three ethical codes (Tib.\nsdom gsum) are distinguished by the centrality they give to\nbasic morality, the importance the bodhisattva's code retains in\ntantra, and in the antinomian tantras the presence of a separate\npr\u0101timok\u1e63a-like ordination ritual built around a\ncodification of of ethical conduct specific to tantric\npractitioners.\n\nBy 1409, at the age of 52, his place in Tibetan society was\nsufficiently established that he could garner the support and\nsponsorship necessary for a successful rejuvenation of the central\ntemple in Lhasa, for establishing a new-year prayer festival (smon\nlam chen mo), and for completion of a large new monastery, Ganden\n(dGa' ldan), where he lived for much of his subsequent life\nuntil his death there in 1419. He inspired two of his students Tashi\nPalden (bKra shis dpal ldan) (1379\u20131449) and Shakya\nYeshey (Ye shes) (1354\u20131435) to found Drepung ('Bras\nspungs) monastery in 1416, and Sera Monastery in 1419, respectively.\nThese, with Ganden, would later become the three largest and most\npowerful Gelukpa monasteries, and indeed, the biggest monasteries in\nthe world. In 1407 and 1413 the Ming dynasty Yongle Emperor recognized\nTsongkhapa's growing fame and importance by inviting him to the\nChinese court, as was the custom.\n",
