    "main_text": "Truthmaker Accounts of Ontological Commitment || The Problem of Sufficiency: Implicit Commitment Revisited\n3.4 The Problem of Sufficiency: Implicit Commitment Revisited\nThe truthmaker account of ontological commitment\u2014like the\nquantifier account, but for an entirely different reason\u2014has a\nproblem with capturing implicit commitment. The problem arises\nbecause the truthmakers for a theory, but not the ontological\ncommitments of a theory, are entities whose existence\nis sufficient for the truth of the theory. The problem\nafflicts both the truthmaker criterion for particulars, and for\nkinds. Indeed, assuming truthmaker necessitarianism, it follows from\nthe former criterion that a theory is ontologically committed to a\nparticular only if the existence of the particular is both\nnecessary and sufficient for the truth of the theory; it follows from\nthe latter criterion that a theory is ontologically committed to a\nkind only if the existence of some members (or other) of the kind\nis both necessary and sufficient for the truth of the\ntheory. But the examples of implicit commitment considered\nin \u00a71.7.4\nand \u00a71.7.5 suggest that sufficiency\nis not required for ontological commitment. The truthmaker account,\nlike the quantifier account, undergenerates\ncommitments.[34]\nTo illustrate the problem of sufficiency, consider the following\nexamples. Suppose, as is standard, that the existence of a set\nnecessitates the existence of any of its members. Then, intuitively,\nthe sentence \u2018{a, b} exists\u2019 is\nimplicitly committed to a, a result that is captured by\nentailment accounts of ontological commitment. But since the existence\nof a is not sufficient for the existence of\n{a, b}, a is not a truthmaker for\n\u2018{a, b} exists\u2019, and the truthmaker\ncriterion for particulars fails to capture this commitment. For a\nsecond example, suppose that, necessarily, elephants have trunks, but\nthat any trunk could exist without there existing any elephants.\nThen, intuitively, the sentence \u2018elephants exist\u2019 is\nontologically committed, not only to elephants, but to elephants'\ntrunks, a result that is captured by entailment accounts. But since\ntrunks are not among the truthmakers for \u2018elephants\nexist\u2019, the truthmaker criterion for kinds fails to capture this\ncommitment. For a final example, consider the sentence\n\u2018bachelors exist\u2019. Since it is analytic (suppose) that\nmales exist if bachelors exist, this sentence, intuitively, is\nontologically committed to males, a result that is captured by both\nquantifier and entailment accounts. But no male is a truthmaker for\n\u2018bachelors exist\u2019, since any male could exist without\nthere existing any bachelors. So, again, the truthmaker criterion for\nkinds fails to capture an implicit commitment.\nHow might a defender of the truthmaker account\nrespond?[35] It\nwon't do to claim that the notion of ontological commitment targeted\nby the truthmaker account doesn't include the missing implicit\ncommitments.  For one thing, the truthmaker criterion will let in\nthose implicit commitments that pass the sufficiency test, and there\nseems to be no principled reason for admitting these implicit\ncommitments, but not the others. More importantly, excluding implicit\ncommitments does not sit well with the chief motivation for a\ntruthmaker account, viz., that ontological commitments should reflect\nfundamental ontology; for commitments are no less fundamental for\nbeing implicit. The mismatch between the notions of ontological\ncommitment and truthmaking\u2014that the ontological commitments of\na theory are entities whose existence is necessary, given the truth\nof the theory, whereas the truthmakers of a theory are entities whose\nexistence is sufficient for the truth of the theory\u2014seems to be\na serious problem for a truthmaker account of ontological commitment,\nat least as presented above.\nPerhaps the best response to the problem of sufficiency for a\ntruthmaker theorist who wants to capture a deep notion of ontological\ncommitment is to omit the requirement that the ontological commitments\nof a theory be truthmakers for that theory. It is enough that\nthey are truthmakers for some theory or other, that is, that they are\nentities that really exist. This leads to the following criteria:\n\nWeakened Truthmaker Criterion for Particulars: A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to a\nparticular a iff T entails that a really\nexists.\nWeakened Truthmaker Criterion for Kinds: A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to Ks\niff T entails that Ks are among the entities that\nreally exist.[36]\n\nBut it is doubtful that this is properly called a truthmaker\naccount of ontological commitment. The (deep) ontological\ncommitments of a theory are no longer being analyzed in terms of the\ntruthmaker commitments of the theory, but instead in terms of its\nfundamental commitments, its commitments to entities that really\nexist. And these, we have seen, are not the same.\n",
