    "main_text": "GQ Theory and Linguistics\n18. Quantification and Cognition\n\nIn recent years there has been an explosion of work connecting\nsemantics, reasoning, and cognition, much of it related to how\nspeakers understand and learn and reason with quantified expressions.\nA major strand of research concerns monotonicity (section\n13). Already Barwise and Cooper (1981)\nnoted the ubiquity of monotone quantifiers in natural languages, and\nsuggested a way of showing that monotone quantifiers are easier to\nprocess than non-monotone ones, and that increasing quantifiers are\neasier than decreasing ones. They also suggested that psychological\nexperiments might be used to test their hypothesis. Their technical\nproposal was developed further in van Benthem\n(1986), which introduced a notion of count complexity\nand showed that, under some assumptions, the quantifiers with minimal\ncount complexity are precisely the ones with a certain strong\nmonotonicity\n property.[39]\n\nMonotonicity is also involved in what van Benthem has called\n\u201cone-step\u201d reasoning, which appears to be easily available\nto speakers. The monotonicity behavior of basic determiners already\nshows how such reasoning is licensed. Marking right increasing\n(decreasing) type \\({\\langle}1,1{\\rangle}\\) quantifiers with a + (a\n\\(-\\)) to the right, and similarly for left monotonicity, we have, for\nexample:\n\n\\(-\\textit{every}+\\) \\(+\\textit{some}+\\)\n\\(-\\textit{no}-\\)\n\\(\\cdot\\,\\textit{most}+\\)\n\\(\\cdot\\,\\textit{exactly three}\\,\\cdot\\)\n\n\nwhere \\(\\cdot\\) marks that the position is neither decreasing nor\nincreasing. A nice example is the following inference (from Icard\nand Moss (2014), adapting an example in\nGeurts and Slik (2005)):\n\n\n\n(43)\n\n\nMost Americans who know a foreign\nlanguage speak it at home \n\nMost Americans who know a foreign\nlanguage speak it at home or at work\n\n\n\n\nThe premise is a \u201cdonkey sentence\u201d with most,\nand it is notoriously hard to pin down the exact\ntruth conditions of these. In fact, several readings are\n possible.[40]\n In spite of this, speakers seem to have no problem making this\ninference, apparently since most is right increasing (the VP\nargument speak it at home is extended to speak it at home\nor at work), regardless of what the subject noun phrase (the same\nin both sentences) exactly means.\n\nMany other expressions and phrases besides determiners show fixed\nmonotonicity patterns. Beginning with van\nBenthem (1986) this has led to algorithms for how polarity\nmarkers are assigned to the nodes of analysis trees of sentences\n(relative to a given grammar), or how to incorporate such markers\ndirectly in the type notation; see Icard and\nMoss (2014) for an overview and further references. Besides\ntheir role in inference, such marking can also explain, and sometimes\neven predict, the distribution of negative polarity items in languages\n(end of\n section 13).\n Moreover, in many cases no syntactic analysis is necessary:\ninferences can be made directly on surface form, and would in this\nsense be available \u201con the fly\u201d to speakers; compare\n (43).\n The paper just mentioned also presents a complete axiomatization of a\nformal Monotonicity Calculus, in which many varieties of\nreasoning with monotonicity can be\n expressed.[41]\n\nA somewhat parallel development has been the formal study of various\nsyllogistic fragments; we noted in\n section 2\n that many syllogisms express monotonicity properties. These\nfragments, most of which were studied by Ian Pratt-Hartmann and above\nall Larry Moss, range from those containing only simple sentences like\nallXY or someXY to ones allowing complements,\nrelative clauses, transitive verbs, non-first-order quantifiers like\nmost, and other features. Here is an example (Moss p.c.) of\nan inference in such a fragment:\n\n\nEveryone likes everyone who likes Pat\n Pat likes every clarinetist\n\n\nEveryone likes everyone who likes\neveryone who likes every clarinetist\n\n\n\nThis illustrates how quite involved reasoning can be expressed in a\nsimple syllogistic-like language. The inference is valid, but one has\nto think a bit to see\n that.[42]\n A main feature of most of these fragments is that, in addition to\nhaving explicit complete axiomatizations, validity in them is\ndecidable, in contrast with first-order logic. This also\nholds for some fragments with quantifiers that are not\nFO-definable. Like the monotonicity calculus, the study of\nsyllogistic fragments is part of the enterprise somewhat loosely\ncalled natural logic, resulting in well-behaved subsystems of\nmore familiar logics, in the sense of being both closer to natural\nlanguage and computationally more tractable; see Moss\n(2015) for a\n survey.[43]\n\nOn the cognitive side, questions of understanding and learning related\nto quantification and monotonicity have been studied both in\npsychology and neuroscience. Geurts and Slik\n(2005) asked subjects whether certain inferences involving\nmonotonicity were valid or not; the results largely corroborated\nBarwise and Cooper\u2019s earlier hypotheses. The meaning of\nindividual determiners has also been studied empirically; Pietroski\net al. (2009) investigated most,\nwhere the method was to show subjects\na picture with yellow and blue dots for a very short time (to\neliminate counting) and ask, say, if it is true or false that most of\nthe dots are yellow. Variations of this kind of experiment are common\nin the literature; a recent instance is Odic et\nal. (2018), which studies the mass/count distinction in\ncognition and semantics. Both studies involve the human number\nsense and its relation to understanding quantificational\nlanguage. One might entertain a \u201cWhorfian\u201d hypothesis that\nthe latter is a prerequisite for the former. This was tested with\nneurobiological methods (brain-scan methods combined with\npsychological tests with patients suffering from various brain\ndisorders) in Clark and Grossman (2007).\nThey did not find any empirical support for that hypothesis; see also\nClark (2011a) for a description of the\nexperiment and more on research on quantification and number\nsense.\n\nThere are by now a fair number of empirical studies of how various\nclasses of quantifiers identified by logical or computational means\nare reflected in terms of learning, understanding, cognitive load,\netc. Conversely, linguistic and cognitive facts suggest new\ntheoretical questions. For example, as regards computational\ncomplexity, Sevenster (2006) showed that the branching of\nmost as in\n (40)\n in\n section 9\n is\n intractable.[44]\n Subsequently, Szymanik observed that if the operations of\nresumption and iteration (as in\n (38)\n and\n (36),\n respectively) are applied to PTIME quantifiers, the result is again\nin PTIME, in contrast with branching. Similarly, some forms of\nreciprocal constructions preserve PTIME computability whereas other\ndon\u2019t: \u201clifting\u201d exactly five with\nRECIP as in\n (39a)\n does, but similarly lifting most as in\n (39b)\n does not.\n\nIn van Benthem\u2019s semantic automata setting\n (section 9),\n Steinert-Threlkeld and Icard (2013)\nproved that the Frege boundary\n (section 16)\n is robust in the sense that if two Conserv\nand Ext type \\({\\langle}1,1{\\rangle}\\)\nquantifiers are recognizable by finite (or push-down) automata, then\nso is their iteration. Moreover, Steinert-Threlkeld\n(2016) showed that for\nlarge classes of type \\({\\langle}1,1,2{\\rangle}\\) quantifiers, it is\ndecidable whether they are iterations of type\n\\({\\langle}1,1{\\rangle}\\) quantifiers or not. A recent presentation of\nboth theoretical and empirical results around the cognitive aspects of\nquantifier recognition is Szymanik\n(2016).\n\nComputational models of learning the meaning of quantifiers\nhave been given; for example by Clark (2011a) in the semantic automata\nsetting. In a recent development, Steinert-Threlkeld\nand Szymanik (forthcoming)\nstudies learnability with the technology of neural networks, testing\nwhether certain quantifiers satisfying three commonly proposed\nuniversals\u2014that simple determiner denotations are\nmonotone, Isom, and Conserv,\nrespectively\u2014are easier to learn than quantifiers that do not\nhave these properties. For each universal, the time it takes the\nnetwork to learn a quantifier satisfying it is compared to the time it\ntakes to learn a quantifier that doesn\u2019t. It turns out that\nmonotone and Isom are easier than non-monotone\nand non-Isom ones, whereas there is no\ndetectable difference for Conserv.[45]\n\nThese are just glimpses of ongoing research. The investigation of how\nspeakers process quantified expressions, combining the basic\nmodel-theoretic analysis with methods from psychology, neuroscience,\nand computer science, is by now a rich area in the study of\ngeneralized quantifiers.\n",
