    "main_text": "Thinking about Mind Prior to the Twentieth Century || Before Descartes\n4.2 Before Descartes\n\nPhilosophers are inclined to trace the problem of other minds back to\nthe writing of Descartes. If it is true that there is something in\nDescartes\u2019 philosophy that gives rise to this problem, then one\nmay expect to find the \u2018problem of other minds\u2019 less\npressing in the work of pre-Cartesian philosophy. With the possible\nexception of Augustine (whose work is taken by some to be a pre-cursor\nto Descartes\u2019), this is arguably the case.\n\nWhile philosophers in ancient Greece raise sceptical questions\nconcerning others, it is has been suggested that the problems they\nraise tend to be \u2018thin\u2019 rather than \u2018thick\u2019\nones (see\n \u00a71\n and Avramides 2001). Plato and Aristotle, for example, discuss the\nvalue of friendship, but do not ask why we should think others exist\nto be friends. Sorabji claims that \u201cit never occurs to Aristotle\nto raise doubts about other minds\u201d (1974: 88). According to\nSextus Empiricus, sceptics of the Cyrenaic school raise problems about\nthe minds of others, but it is not clear that the problem they raise\ngoes beyond the \u2018thin\u2019 one, How can I know what\nanother thinks and feels? (Tsouna\n 1998a).[19]\n",
