Unification with the Liar Paradox\n\nThe sorites paradox has traditionally been seen as unrelated in any\nsubstantially interesting way to the semantic and set-theoretic\nparadoxes of self-reference. However, McGee (1991) and Tappenden\n(1993) proposed a unified treatment of the liar and sorites paradoxes\nbased on similarities between vague predicates and the truth\npredicate. More recently, Field (2003: 262) speaks of \n\n\nsome temptation to connect up the [semantic paradoxes and the\nparadoxes of vagueness] by viewing the semantic paradoxes as due to\nsomething akin to vagueness or indeterminacy in semantic concepts like\n\u2018true\u2019. \n\n\nField 2008 further develops this theme, though it is devoted primarily\nto a resolution of the liar, Curry\u2019s and other paradoxes. Field\u2019s\napproach is by way of a logic that abandons the law of excluded\nmiddle.\n\nSome see unification as much more clearly indicated by the supposed\nfact that the semantic and sorites paradoxes themselves are \u201cof\na kind\u201d. Thus Colyvan (2009) points to a number of ways in which\nparadoxes might be thought to be of a kind per se, concluding\nthat the liar and the sorites are examples and thus deserving of a\nsimilar solution. Priest (2010) adds weight to this claim, arguing\nthat both the paradoxes of self-reference and the sorites paradox have\na common underlying structure, satisfaction of what Priest calls\n\u201cthe inclosure schema\u201d. On the assumption that this common\nstructure is sufficient to warrant a similar treatment, Priest\nadvocates a paraconsistent response to the sorites having elsewhere\ndefended a paraconsistent response to the paradoxes of self-reference.\nIn fact, as with paradoxical sentences, some vague sentences involving\nborderline cases will furnish examples of true contradictions,\ndialethias.\n",
