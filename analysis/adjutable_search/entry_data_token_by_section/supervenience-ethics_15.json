    "main_text": "Metaphysical Supervenience and Ethical Realism || Grounding explanations of ethical supervenience\n4.3 Grounding explanations of ethical supervenience\n\nThe strategies for explaining ethical supervenience discussed in the\npreceding two sections are useful to reductionist and\nfunctionalist ethical realists. However, many contemporary\nethical realists reject both functionalism and reductionism about\nethical properties. Most strikingly, several contemporary ethical\nrealists are non-naturalists, claiming that the ethical\nproperties are a distinct and irreducible class of properties (see the\nentry on\n moral non-naturalism\n for discussion). Several philosophers have argued that ethical\nsupervenience poses a distinctive problem for the non-naturalist\n(Dreier 1992, 2019 ; Ridge 2007; McPherson 2012; V\u00e4yrynen 2017).\nSo it is worth asking what metaphysical resources non-naturalists\nmight have for explaining the supervenience of the ethical.\n\nA salient place to begin is with the grounding relation. As\nwas noted in\n Section 1,\n grounding has recently been theorized as an asymmetrical explanatory\nmetaphysical relationship (For an introduction to grounding, see the\nentry on\n metaphysical grounding;\n for a useful discussion of relevant issues in the context of ethics,\nsee V\u00e4yrynen 2013a). It is thus natural to ask whether the\nnon-naturalist could explain the supervenience of the ethical on the\nbase properties by appealing to the fact that: certain facts about the\ninstantiation of the base properties fully ground all facts\nabout the instantiation of the ethical properties.\n\nA natural question at this point concerns why such a\ngrounding relationship holds. An influential answer is that all\ngrounding facts are themselves explained in essentialist terms (Fine\n1994, Rosen 2010). As\n Section 4.1\n suggested, these essentialist explanations can appear to have\nreductionist implications. If so, essentialist explanations are no\nhelp to the non-naturalist.\n\nStephanie Leary has offered an ingenious proposal within the\nessentialist framework: she posits a class of \u201chybrid\u201d\nproperties, whose essences entail (i) that they are instantiated just\nin case certain base properties are instantiated, and (ii) that\nethical properties are instantiated whenever they are instantiated,\nand argues that these relations do not suffice for essentialist\nreduction of the ethical (Leary 2017; for critical discussion see\nFaraci 2017 and Toppinen 2018).\n\nA recently influential alternative to the essentialist account of\ngrounding proposes that we can explain the grounding of the ethical in\nterms of metaphysical laws. Here is the basic idea. One class\nof ethical facts are facts which state the instantiation of some\nethical property. An example of such an ethical instantiation fact\nwould be: Alice\u2019s current state is intrinsically bad.\nOne explanation of why the ethical supervenes is that such facts are\nalways grounded in certain base facts, such as: Alice is currently\nin pain. The proponent of law-mediated ethical grounding denies\nthat the latter base fact provides a complete grounding explanation\nfor the former ethical fact. Rather, a complete grounding explanation\nwill take this form:\n\n\nIt requires a base fact (e.g. Alice is currently in pain) and\nan ethical law (e.g. Pain grounds badness), in order to fully\nground any ethical instantiation fact (e.g. Alice\u2019s current\nstate is intrinsically bad).\n\n\nSuppose that, necessarily, every possible ethical instantiation fact\nis grounded by the combination of a base fact and an ethical law, as\nin this example. Then, (i) this would provide a complete explanation\nfor supervenience: this grounding structure would explain why the\ninstantiation of ethical properties must covary with thew\ninstantiation of base properties. And (ii) this might look like a\npromising explanation on behalf of the non-naturalist, since the\nethical laws could be metaphysically fundamental ethical entities. If\nethical laws such as the one mentioned here are metaphysically\nfundamental, then one might think that this would secure\nnon-naturalism (For this reason, Gideon Rosen calls such\nmetaphysically fundamental laws \u2018Moorean connections\u2019\n(2010, \u00a713).\n\nThe appeal to fundamental laws may seem to raise the same concerns\nthat a brute supervenience relation did, however: Why is there a\nmetaphysical law linking these distinct properties? The contrast with\nessentialist explanations is striking: in the latter case, facts about\nthe natures of the related properties explain the links between them.\nHowever, some have argued that metaphysical grounding relations are\neither commonly, or even universally, law-mediated (e.g. Kment 2014,\n\u00a76.2.3; Wilsch 2015). For a taste of the currently flowering\nliterature on the explanatory role of ethical laws or principles, see\n(Eliot 2014; Scanlon 2014, Ch. 2; Schroeder 2014; Skarsaune 2015;\n\u00a77; Rosen 2017a; 2017c; Berker forthcoming; and Morton\nforthcoming).\n\nThis brief sketch of possible types of metaphysical explanations of\nsupervenience barely scratches the surface. Among the many other\noptions, replies grounded in appeals to tropes or universals have\ngarnered explicit attention (Ridge 2007, Suikkanen 2010). As with the\nappeal to grounding, a central question about such strategies is\nwhether they constitute genuine explanatory progress, or whether they\nsimply explain one necessity by appealing to some further brute\nnecessity.\n",
