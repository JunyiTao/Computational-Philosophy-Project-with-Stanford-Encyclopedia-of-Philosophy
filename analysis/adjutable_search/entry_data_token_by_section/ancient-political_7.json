    "main_text": "Socrates and Plato || The Defense of Justice in the Republic\n3.3 The Defense of Justice in the Republic\n\nThe Crito depends upon a notion of justice and injustice\nwhich it never defines. In the Republic, by contrast, a\ndialogue in which Socrates is also the main character (and\nfirst-person narrator) but in which the views he advances go beyond\nthe tight-knit pattern of debates in the dialogues discussed in\nsection 3.1, Plato (424/3\u2013348/7\n BCE)[7]\n offers an account of justice linking the political to the\npsychological and justice to a higher understanding of true goodness.\n(See the entry on\n Plato.)\n The Republic is, with the Laws, an order of\nmagnitude longer than any other Platonic dialogue. Readers today are\nlikely to think of the Republic as the home par excellence of\npolitical philosophy. But that view has also been challenged by\nscholars who see it as primarily an ethical dialogue, driven by the\nquestion of why the individual should be just (Annas 1999). This\nsection argues that the ethical and political concerns, and purposes,\nof the dialogue are inextricably intertwined.\n\nNear the beginning of the dialogue, a challenge is launched by the\ncharacter Thrasymachus, mentioned above, asserting that all actual\ncities define justice so as to serve the advantage of the rulers. He\ntakes this to mean that the laws which their subjects are bound to\nobey and the associated ethical virtue of justice which they are\nenjoined to cultivate (traditionally seen as the necessary bond among\ncitizens and the justification for political rule), in fact amount to\na distorted sham. (See the entry on\n Callicles and Thrasymachus.)\n The question which Thrasymachus poses and which Plato\u2019s\nbrothers Glaucon and Adeimantus reformulate\u2014why should the\nindividual be just if he or she can get away with not being just, when\nelevated above the demands of ordinary justice either by special power\nor good fortune?\u2014thus already has a political valence from the\noutset.\n\nSocrates then launches a speculation as to the origins of cities: the\ncity is held to have an existence independently of ethical concerns,\ncoming into being for economic reasons and immediately needing to\ndefend itself in war (and also to be able to make offensive war for\neconomic gain). However, this origin already gives rise to a\nproto-ethical dimension, first insofar as the members of the primitive\ncity each do their own work (the structure of what will emerge as the\nvirtue of justice), which is fleshed out when political rulers are\nestablished who are able to use their wisdom to help their subjects\nmaintain a psychological balance in their souls that approximates, if\nit does not fully embody, the virtues of moderation and justice and so\nenables them to enjoy a unified rather than a divided soul. The\nquestion of why the individual should be just, figured at the outset\nby the contrast with the putatively happy tyrant, is resolved\neventually by demonstrating that the tyrant will necessarily, in\nvirtue of the disorder of his soul, be at once maximally unjust and\nmaximally unhappy.\n\nThat resolution rests on the division of the soul into three parts by\nwhich the Republic places moral psychology at the heart of\npolitical philosophy. Both soul and city are posited by Socrates in\narguments in Books II\u2013IV and VIII\u2013IX, in particular, to\nhave a tripartite structure when the soul is embodied in a living\nperson. In the soul and city respectively, the rational part or class\nshould rule; the spirited part or class should act to support the rule\nof that rational part; and the appetitive part of the soul and\nproducing class in the city should accept being governed by it. Both\nsoul and city are therefore in need of, and capable of exhibiting,\nfour virtues (427e\u2013444a). Two of these pertain to individual\nparts: the rational part being capable of wisdom, the spirited part of\ncourage. Two however are defined by relations between the parts:\nmoderation as the agreement of all three parts that reason should\nrule, justice as each part doing its own (this echoes, in a radically\nnew context, a conservative Athenian suspicion of excessive democratic\npolupragmosun\u00ea or busybody interference).\n\nThe result is that justice is defined as primarily a condition of\none\u2019s soul or city as a whole, not as any specific just action;\nyet if the soul or city is so ordered, the individual will have no\ncause to engage in the paradigmatically unjust action of\npleonexia or grasping for more than one\u2019s fair share. A\njust soul will indeed reliably issue in traditionally just actions,\nsuch as refraining from theft, murder, and sacrilege (contra Sachs\n1963, who argues that Plato has simply abandoned the usual domain of\njustice). But what makes its \u2018justice\u2019 count as such goes\nbeyond these particular actions and omissions, lying in the health and\norderliness of such a soul contrasted with the chaotic or even\ntyrannical character of an unjust soul (Burnyeat 2013). To be a truly\neffective, because wholly unified, agent, one must be just, moderate,\ncourageous and wise. The just person enjoys psychic health, which is\nadvantageous no matter how he is treated (fairly or unfairly) by gods\nand men; correspondingly, the just society enjoys civic unity, which\nis advantageous in being the fundamental way to avoid the assumed\nsupreme evil of civil war. In contrast, all other cities are\ncharacterized as riven by civil war between the rich and the poor;\nnone of them counts as a single, unified city at all (see Rep.\n422e\u2013423a, and more generally, Book VIII of that dialogue).\n\nBy treating these ethical and political questions as interrelated, and\nthen going on to depict both an ideal political regime (\u201ca\nkallipolis\u201d, the fine or beautiful city) in which they could be\nsolved, and the imperfect regimes into which such an ideal regime will\ndecay, the Republic lays out a novel and ambitious template\nfor political philosophy: not only to interrogate the meaning of\nvirtue and citizenship, but also to develop an ideal regime and an\naccount of how and why such regimes may fail. That template will be\nfollowed by Aristotle\u2019s Politics, by Cicero\u2019s\nDe re publica, and by Thomas More\u2019s Utopia,\namong other successors. In Plato\u2019s hands, however, this template\nincluded some specific political prescriptions to maintain the unity\nof the ideal city which most of his successors abhorred. In\nparticular, Book V of the Republic suggests that a\nsufficiently unified regime can be achieved only by depriving its\nguardian-rulers of private property and of private families, instead\nmaking them live in austere communal conditions in which they are\nfinancially supported by their money-making subjects and allowed to\nprocreate only when and with whom will best serve the city. In Book II\nof his Politics, Aristotle would read this prescription as\napplying to all the citizens in the city envisaged in the\nRepublic, and both he and, later on, Cicero would deplore\nwhat they construed as this abolition of private property. Even those\nfollowing and radicalizing Plato precisely by advocating the abolition\nof property for all the citizens, rather than only deprivation of it\nfor the rulers, as would the sixteenth-century Sir Thomas More, were\ngenerally opposed to if not also scandalized by the suggestion of\nprocreative communism.\n\nThe Republic initiates a further tradition in political\nphilosophy by laying out a template for the integration of ethics and\npolitical philosophy into a comprehensive account of epistemology and\nmetaphysics. By making the claim of the philosophers to rule depend on\ntheir knowledge of the good and of the other Platonic Forms (in\nconjunction with their moral character and tested practical\nexperience), the dialogue vindicates the Socratic and Platonic thought\nthat ruling well\u2014what we might call \u201crule\u201d proper\n\u2013 requires a rare form of expertise rather than lay judgment,\nrhetorical advice, or common knowledge. In the Republic, the\nknowledge required for rule is not specialized, but comprehensive: the\nknowledge of the good and the Forms is somehow to translate into an\nability to make laws as well as the everyday decisions of rule. The\nrulers are philosophers who take turns over their lifetime in\nexercising political authority. They define their vocation as that of\nphilosophizing, engaging in rule out of some sort of compulsion or\nnecessity (see the entry on\n Plato\u2019s ethics and politics in the Republic).\n To that extent the Republic presents a paradox: if it is\nwidely considered the first major work of political\n philosophy,[8]\n it envisages a constitution in which philosophers rule but do so\nseparately from their role of philosophizing. \n",
