    "main_text": "Arguments for Disjunctivism || A Phenomenological Argument\n3.3 A Phenomenological Argument\n\n\nMartin argues for a na\u00efve realist account of the kind of\nexperience one has when one genuinely perceives the world. According to\nthis na\u00efve realist account, when one genuinely perceives the world\none is directly aware of mind-independent objects and their features.\nFurthermore, according to this view, when one perceives the world, the\nactual objects of perception, the external things such as trees, and\ntables, which one can perceive, and the properties they manifest to one\nwhen perceived, partly constitute one\u2019s conscious experience, and\nhence determine its phenomenal character. (See Martin\u2019s\ndiscussion of na\u00efve realism in his 1997, 1998, 2002, 2004, and\n2006.) Since one is not aware of mind-independent objects and their\nfeatures when one hallucinates, the na\u00efve realist cannot offer the\nsame account of the phenomenal character of hallucinations. The\nna\u00efve realist is committed, then, to the claim that the kind of\nphenomenally conscious episode that occurs when one perceives the world\nis not one that could be occurring were one hallucinating. So in order\nto preserve his na\u00efve realist account of the phenomenal character\nof genuine perceptions, Martin advocates a disjunctive account of\nperceptual experience. According to Martin, genuine perceptions and\nintrospectively indiscriminible hallucinations are not mental events of\nthe same fundamental kind.\n\n\nMartin\u2019s na\u00efve realist account of genuine perception is\nmotivated by phenomenological considerations. He argues that\nna\u00efve realism best articulates how sensory experience seems to us\nto be through introspective reflection. If introspective reflection\nsupports a na\u00efve realist account of the phenomenal character of\ngenuine perceptions, then presumably introspective reflection should\nlend the same support to a na\u00efve realist account of the\nphenomenal character of hallucinations that are introspectively\nindiscriminible from genuine perceptions. Since the na\u00efve realist\naccount of phenomenal character cannot be applied to hallucinations,\nthe na\u00efve realist must then say that hallucinations that are\nintrospectively indiscriminible from genuine perceptions do not have\nthe phenomenal character that introspective reflection\nsuggests\u2014they do not have the phenomenal character that they\nintrospectively seem to us to have. However, if Martin is right in his\nclaim that introspective reflection supports na\u00efve realism, then\nif we reject na\u00efve realism, we will have to accept\nthat all perceptual experiences, whether genuine perceptions\nor hallucinations, fail to have the phenomenal character that\nintrospective reflection suggests. (For a similar proposal, see also\nLangsam 2017).\n\n\nAs Martin sees it, then, the dialectical position is this: the\ndisjunctivist na\u00efve realist allows that at least some of our\nperceptual experiences really do have the phenomenal character that\nthey introspectively seem to have\u2014namely the genuine\nperceptions\u2014whereas the opponent of na\u00efve realism needs to\ndeny that any of our perceptual experiences really do have the\nphenomenal character that they introspectively seem to have. So Martin\nadvocates the disjunctivist na\u00efve realist view as the best error\ntheory concerning perceptual experience and the introspection of\nexperience.\n The claim that when one genuinely perceives the world one is\ndirectly aware of mind-independent objects and their features is not\ndistinctive of the na\u00efve realist account. For example, someone\nwho holds an intentionalist account of experience can also accept this\nclaim. According to this view our perceptual experiences are mental\nstates with intentional contents that represent the world as being a\ncertain way, and when one has an experience with a veridical content,\nin the right circumstances, one is directly aware of mind-independent\nobjects in one\u2019s environment. (Advocates of such intentionalist\naccounts of experience include Searle (1983), Harman (1990), Tye\n(1992, 1995, and 2000), Burge (1993 and 2010), Dretske (1995), Byrne\n(2001), and Pautz (2010)). Many have argued that this sort of theory\ncan adequately accommodate the phenomenological aspects of experience\nthat a na\u00efve realist might point to\u2014e.g., the apparent\npresence to mind of mind-independent objects and their\nfeatures\u2014without being committed to the idea that hallucinations\nfail to have the phenomenal character that they introspectively seem\nto have.\n\n\nMartin (2002) compares and contrasts the intentionalist and na\u00efve\nrealist accounts of these phenomenological aspects of perceptual\nexperience and argues that introspective reflection on the nature of\nsensory imagination\u2014in particular, visualising\u2014 gives us\nreason to support the na\u00efve realist account over the\nintentionalist one. Martin\u2019s argument for this claim has the following\nstructure: (i) He compares and contrasts the na\u00efve realist and\nintentionalist accounts of certain aspects of the phenomenology of\nperceptual experience\u2014their transparency and immediacy. (ii) He\nargues for a thesis about visualising\u2014the \u2018dependency\nthesis\u2019, which states that to visualise an F is to\nimagine a visual experience of an F. (For an influential\ndiscussion of this idea, see Williams 1973. For an endorsement of the\nview, see Peacocke 1985 and Vendler 1984.) (iii) He argues that the\ntruth of the dependency thesis should lead the intentionalist and the\nna\u00efve realist to make different predictions about the\nphenomenology of visualising, given their different accounts of the\ntransparency and immediacy of perceptual experience. So, he claims,\nthe phenomenology of visualising can be regarded as a test of these\ncompeting views. (iv) He argues that the phenomenology of our episodes\nof visualising favours the na\u00efve realist account.\n\n\nThe particular phenomenological aspects of perceptual\nexperience\u2014transparency and immediacy\u2014that the na\u00efve\nrealist and the intentionalist try to accommodate in different ways,\nare the following. Transparency: When one attends to what it\nis like for one to have a visual experience it seems to one as though\none does so through attending to mind-independent objects in one\u2019s\nenvironment and their features. Immediacy:\nFurthermore, our perceptual experiences are non-neutral about the\nactual presence of the mind-independent objects and features in our\nenvironment they are directed upon. They appear to have a coercive\npower and authority over our beliefs. Even if one believes that one is\nhallucinating, the phenomenal immediacy of the experience\u2014its\nnon-neutrality about the actual presence of mind-independent objects\nand features in our environment\u2014is not thereby extinguished.\nIntentionalists can explain the transparency and immediacy of\nperceptual experience in terms of the idea that (a) perceptual\nexperiences are mental states with intentional contents that represent\nthe mind-independent world as being a certain way (hence\ntransparency); and in terms of the idea that (b) such states play a\ndistinctive kind of functional role in our mental economy (hence\nimmediacy). This is not the account offered by the na\u00efve\nrealist. For the na\u00efve realist, one\u2019s experience relates to the\nworld in a non-representational manner. According to the na\u00efve\nrealist, the transparency and immediacy of genuine perceptions are\nexplained in terms of the idea that mind-independent objects and their\nfeatures are constituents of one\u2019s perceptual experience that\ndetermine, at least in part, the phenomenal character of that\nexperience. The phenomenal transparency and immediacy of a\nhallucination is explained derivatively\u2014in terms of its being\nintrospectively indiscriminible from something it is not\u2014a\nmental event with the phenomenal character of a genuine\nperception.\n\n\nOn the face of it, the intentionalist appears to be able to\naccommodate adequately the transparency and immediacy of experience\nwithout committing to the idea that hallucinations fail to have the\nphenomenal character that introspective reflection suggests. This might\nlead one to favour the intentionalist view. However, Martin argues that\nreflecting on the phenomenology of visualising gives us reason to think\notherwise.\n\n\nMartin argues that in order to capture adequately the respect in which\nthe phenomenology of visualising an F has some correspondence\nwith the phenomenology of having a visual experience of an F,\nwe should accept the dependency thesis\u2014the thesis that to\nvisualise an F is to imagine a visual experience of\nan F. He then argues that the truth of the dependency thesis\nshould lead the intentionalist and the na\u00efve realist to make\ndifferent predictions about the phenomenology of visualising. Martin\nargues that if the dependency thesis is correct, then the\nintentionalist should hold that when we visualise, we imagine a mental\nstate (i.e., a visual experience) that represents the world to be a\ncertain way and that has a distinctive kind of functional role. We\nmay, as part of our imaginative project, suppose that the imagined\nsituation contains the objects and features represented by the\nimagined visual experience, but, argues Martin, the intentionalist\nshould predict that (a) when one visualises something, e.g., an apple,\nthe imagistic character of one\u2019s visualising should itself be neutral\nwith respect to whether or not one is imagining a scene that contains\nan apple, and (b) something other than the putative object of\nexperience (i.e., the apple) should be available to introspection. The\nrepresentational properties of the experience one is imagining should\nbe revealed to one as such.\n\n\nAccording to Martin, as the na\u00efve realist offers a rather\ndifferent account of the phenomenal transparency and immediacy of\nvisual experience, the na\u00efve realist should make rather different\npredictions about the phenomenology of visualising. According to the\nna\u00efve realist, a visual experience of an apple seems to its\nsubject to be constitutively dependent on the presence of the\napple. So given the truth of the dependency thesis, the na\u00efve\nrealist should predict that when one visualises an apple, the\nimagistic character of one\u2019s visualising won\u2019t be neutral\nwith respect to whether or not one is imagining a scene that contains\nan apple. It should be committal on the presence of an apple in the\nimagined scene. Martin claims that the actual phenomenology of\nvisualising is more in keeping with what the na\u00efve realist\npredicts. He argues that as introspective reflection best supports the\nna\u00efve realist prediction, we can either deny na\u00efve realism\nand hold that none of our perceptual experiences have the phenomenal\ncharacter that introspective reflections suggests, or we can accept a\nna\u00efve realist account of genuine perceptions and hold that only\nsome of our perceptual experiences fail to have the phenomenal\ncharacter that introspective reflection suggests. This latter\nposition, according to Martin, is the least revisionary option.\n\n\nOne line of objection against Martin\u2019s argument targets the\ndependency thesis. For example, Noordhof (2002) and Burge (2005)\nquestion the plausibility of a claim that appears to be a commitment of\nthe dependency thesis: that in visualising an object one must be\nimagining a perceptual experience of the object, despite the fact that\nimagining the experience may have been no part of your imaginative\nproject. Some opponents of the dependency thesis have argued that the\ncorrespondences between visual experience and visualising are to be\naccounted for by the fact that there are similarities in the\nrepresentational contents of these episodes. (See Noordhof 2002 and\nCurrie and Ravenscroft 2002.)\n\n\nAn alternative response to the argument may be to accept the\ndependency thesis, but to question whether introspective reflection\nreally does support the claim that the imagistic character of\nvisualising an apple is itself non-neutral with respect to whether the\nimagined scene contains an apple. It might be held instead that the\nphenomenology of an episode of visualising does not speak to such\nmatters independently of the question of what suppositions the subject\nis making in engaging in his imaginative project (see Burge 2005).\nAlternatively, one might raise a more general scepticism about the\nreliability of appeals to introspection in supporting claims about the\nreal nature of perceptual experiences (see Spener 2003). Some may hold\nthat since we must allow that hallucinations do not have the sort of\nphenomenal character that introspective reflection suggests, there is\nlittle additional cost in allowing that veridical perceptions also\nfail to have the phenomenal character that introspective reflection\nsuggests.
