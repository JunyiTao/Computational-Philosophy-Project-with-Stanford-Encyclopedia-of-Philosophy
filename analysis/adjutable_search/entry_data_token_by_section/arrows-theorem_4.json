    "main_text": "Arrow\u2019s Framework || Social Welfare Functions\n2.3 Social Welfare Functions\nSometimes a certain amount is known about everybody\u2019s preferences\nbefore these have been elicited. Profiles that are compatible with\nwhat is known represent preferences that the people could have, and\nmight turn out actually to have, and it is from these\n\u201cadmissible\u201d profiles that we may hope to derive social\norderings. Technically, a domain, in Arrow\u2019s framework, is a\nset of admissible profiles, each concerning the same alternatives \\(X\\)\nand people \\(1, \\ldots, n\\). A social welfare function \\(f\\)\nassigns to each profile \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) in some domain a binary\nrelation \\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) on \\(X\\). Intuitively, \\(f\\) is an\naggregation procedure and \\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) represents the\nsocial preferences that it derives from \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\).\nArrow\u2019s social welfare functions are sometimes called\n\u201cconstitutions\u201d.\nArrow incorporated into the notion of a social welfare function the\nfurther requirement that \\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) is always a weak\nordering of the set \\(X\\) of alternatives.  Informally speaking, this\nmeans that the output of the social welfare function must always be a\nranking of the alternatives from better to worse, perhaps with\nties. It may never be a cycle. This requirement will appear here, as\nit does in other contemporary presentations of Arrow\u2019s theorem, as a\nseparate condition of Social Ordering that social welfare\nfunctions might be required to meet.  See\n Section 3.1. This way, we can consider the\n consequences of dropping this\ncondition without changing any basic parts of the framework.\nSee Section 4.2.\nArrow established a convention that is still widely observed of\nusing \u2018\\(R\\)\u2019 to denote the social preference derived from\n\u201c\\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\)\u201d. The social welfare function used to derive it\nis, in his notation, left implicit. One advantage of writing\n\u2018\\(f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\)\u2019 instead of \u2018\\(R\\)\u2019 is\nthat when we state the conditions of the impossibility theorem, in the\nnext section, the social welfare function will figure explicitly in\nthem. This makes it quite clear that what these conditions constrain\nis the functional relationship between individual and social\npreferences. Focusing attention on this was an important innovation of\nArrow\u2019s approach.\n",
