Moral Intuitions and Conceptual Analysis\n\nOne role for experiments in moral philosophy, as indicated above, is\nto investigate our moral intuitions about cases, and to use the\nresults gleaned from such investigations to guide or constrain our\nmoral metaphysics, semantics, or epistemology. Philosophers often rely\non such judgments\u2014in the form of claims to the effect that\n\u201cwe would judge x\u201d or, \u201cintuitively,\nx\u201d\u2014as data or evidence for a theory (though see Cappelen\n2012, Deutsch 2016, and Machery 2017 for critical discussion of this\npoint). Claims about what we would judge or about the intuitive\nresponse to a case are empirically testable, and one project in\nexperimental moral philosophy (perhaps the dominant original project)\nhas been to test such claims via an investigation of our intuitions\nand related moral judgments. In doing so, experimental moral\nphilosophers can accomplish one of two things: first, they can test\nthe claims of traditional philosophers about what is or is not\nintuitive; second, they can investigate the sources of our intuitions\nand judgments. These tasks can be undertaken as part of a positive\nprogram, which uses our intuitions and judgments as inputs and\nconstructs theories that accommodate and explain them. Alternatively,\nthese tasks can figure in a negative program, which uses experimental\nresearch to undermine traditional appeals to intuition as evidence in\nmoral philosophy and conceptual analysis more broadly. The negative\nprogram can proceed directly or indirectly: either via testing and\nrefuting claims about intuitions themselves, or by discrediting the\nsources of those intuitions by discovering that they are influenced by\nfactors widely regarded as not evidential or unreliable. We discuss\nboth the negative program and the positive program below.\n",
