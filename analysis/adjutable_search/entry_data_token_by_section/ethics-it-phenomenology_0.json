Views on the Nature of Information Technology\n\nIt seems obvious that a world with information technology is somehow\ndifferent from a world without information technology. But what is the\ndifference? Is it a difference of degree (faster, closer, clearer,\netc.) or is it a difference of kind? Does technology shape society or\nsociety shape technology, or both shape each other? What is the nature\nof this shaping? Is it in practices, in ways of thinking, or is it\nmore fundamental? The answers to these questions will obviously\ninfluence the judgements we make about the social and ethical\nimplications of information technology when we consider the policy and\npractical concerns of using information technology in a particular\ndomain (such as commerce, education or government).\n\nThe answers to these questions are also grounded to a large extent in\none\u2019s particular, implicit or explicit, ontology of information\ntechnology itself; what is the nature\u2014way of being\u2014of\ninformation technology as such? Obviously many different ontological\npositions are possible and have emerged. Nevertheless, it may be\nuseful for the purposes of this entry to discern at least two\ncontrasting and prevailing views against which the contribution of\nphenomenology can be rendered visible. The purpose of this section is\nsolely to make the distinctive contribution of phenomenology visible\nrather than being a complete presentation of all possible approaches.\nFor example, obvious omissions from the approaches suggested here are\nthe Marxist or Critical Theory perspective as reflected in the work of\nAndrew Feenberg (1991, 1999), and a poststructuralist perspective as\nreflected in the work of Jean Baudrillard (1983) and Paul Virilio\n(1994). This said, the approaches that are included here are\nreasonably widely held and would as such function as a helpful\ncontrast to the contribution of phenomenology.\n",
