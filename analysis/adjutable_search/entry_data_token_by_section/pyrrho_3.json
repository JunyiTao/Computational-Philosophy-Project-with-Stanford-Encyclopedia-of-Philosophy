Other Reports on Pyrrho\u2019s General Approach\n\nThe other evidence bearing upon Pyrrho\u2019s central philosophical\nattitudes does nothing to settle the dispute between these various\npossible interpretations of the Aristocles passage. A number of texts\nexplicitly or implicitly represent Pyrrho\u2019s outlook as\nessentially identical to the sceptical outlook of the later\nPyrrhonists. However, all of these texts postdate the rise of later\nPyrrhonism itself, and none of them contains anything like the level\nof detail of the Aristocles passage; there is no particular reason to\nsuppose that any of them represents a genuine understanding of Pyrrho\nas distinct from the later Pyrrhonists. There are also a few texts\nthat appear to offer a picture of Pyrrho\u2019s thought that is\ncongenial to the metaphysical interpretation. The most significant of\nthese is a passage from near the beginning of Diogenes Laertius\u2019\nlife of Pyrrho (9.61); Pyrrho, we are told, \u201csaid that nothing\nis either fine or ignoble or just or unjust; and similarly in all\ncases that nothing is the case in reality (m\u00eaden einai\nt\u00eai al\u00eatheiai), but that human beings do everything\nby convention and habit; for each thing is no more this than\nthat\u201d. This looks as if it is attributing to Pyrrho a\nmetaphysical thesis, and a thesis according to which things have no\ndefinite features; it does not seem to be portraying Pyrrho as an\nadvocate of suspension of judgement. However, the passage is\nundoubtedly in some way confused. For immediately beforehand we are\ntold that Pyrrho was the one who initiated the type of philosophy\nconsisting of \u201cinapprehensibility and suspension of\njudgement\u201d, which sounds epistemic; and the previously quoted\npassage is then cited as confirmation of this. In addition, while\n\u201cnothing is the case in reality\u201d and \u201ceach thing is\nno more this than that\u201d sound wholly general, Diogenes\u2019\nexamples are all in the domain of values, which ties in with the\npossibility that Pyrrho\u2019s statement about the nature of things,\nin the Aristocles passage, was only about values and that most of that\npassage represents Timon\u2019s views rather than\nPyrrho\u2019s. This passage of Diogenes, then, cannot be used as\nsupport for any particular understanding of Pyrrho.\n",
