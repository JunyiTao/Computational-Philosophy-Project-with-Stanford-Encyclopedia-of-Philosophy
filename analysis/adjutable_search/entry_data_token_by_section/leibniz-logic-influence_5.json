Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg on Leibniz\u2019s General Characteristic\nThe most important figure in this second period of reception was\nFriedrich Adolf Trendelenburg (1802\u20131872). He had studied\nphilology, history and philosophy at the universities of Kiel, Leipzig\nand Berlin (cf. Bratuschek 1872; Vilkko 2002, 56\u201381; Vilkko 2009,\n211\u2013217; Peckhaus 2007). Among his teachers were Karl Leonhard\nReinhold and Johann Erich von Berger. He became professor in 1833; in\n1837 he was promoted to full professor of practical philosophy and\neducation at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-University Berlin where he grew\ninto one of the main leaders of Prussian education and German\nphilosophy. An ordinary member of the Royal Prussian Academy of Science\nat Berlin since 1846, he became the secretary of the\nPhilosophical-Historical Section of this Academy in 1847. Trendelenburg\nwas an anti-Hegelian who started from Hegelian philosophy. His fame as\na neo-Aristotelian goes back to his Elementa logices\nAristotelicae, first published in 1836 with five further editions\n(Trendelenburg 1836). In his systematic work on logic he pleaded for a\nunity of logic and metaphysics as found in the Aristotelian organon.\nThis systematic attitude is developed in a comprehensive work\ncontaining heavy criticism of logical systems of his time, his\nLogische Untersuchungen, published in two volumes in 1840\n(Trendelenburg 1840).\nAs a secretary of the Academy, Trendelenburg was charged with\nhonoring Leibniz\u2019s memory. Leibniz had been the first president of the\n\u201cSociet\u00e4t der Wissenschaften\u201d at Berlin, the\npredecessor institution of the Royal Prussian Academy of Science,\nfounded on his initiative in 1700. In 1856, Trendelenburg delivered a\nseminal lecture entitled \u201c\u00dcber Leibnizens Entwurf einer\nallgemeinen Charakteristik\u201d at the Leibniz ceremony of the\nAcademy at Berlin (Trendelenburg 1857). This paper was reprinted in\nthe third volume of his Historische Beitr\u00e4ge zur\nPhilosophie (1867). In this discussion of Leibniz, Trendelenburg\nstressed the essential role of signs in communication and\nreasoning. There is no logical relation between sign and intuition,\nbut science has provided the opportunity to \u201cbring the\ncomposition of the signs into immediate contact with contents of the\nconcept\u201d (Trendelenburg 1857, 3). The composition of the sign\npresents the characteristic marks distinguished and comprehended in\nthe concept (ibid.). Trendelenburg called such a script\n\u201cBegriffsschrift\u201d. Maybe he took over this term from\nWilhelm von Humboldt who had introduced it in 1824 (v. Humboldt 1826,\nquoted 1848, 532; cf. Thiel 1995, 20). According to Trendelenburg the\nbeginnings of a Begriffsschrift were made, e.g., in the\ndecimal number system. Trendelenburg saw the objectives of Leibniz\u2019s\nprogram as widening such an approach to the complete domain of\nobjects, thereby aiming at a \u201ccharacteristic language of\nconcepts\u201d and a \u201cgeneral language of matter.\u201d He\nmentioned the different names used by Leibniz: lingua characterica\nuniversalis (in fact Trendelenburg\u2019s term; Leibniz\nused characteristica universalis), alphabet of human\nthoughts, calculus philosophicus, calculus\nratiocinator,\nsp\u00e9cieuse g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. These names underline\nthe significance Leibniz ascribed to this program for his philosophy.\nAccording to Trendelenburg, Leibniz aimed at \u201can adequate and\ntherefore general signification of the essence [of conceptual content],\nnamely by such analysis into the elements of concepts, that it becomes\npossible to treat it by calculation\u201d (ibid., 6). He mentioned as\nhistorical precursors the ars magna of Raymundus Lullus and\nother conceptions of universal languages. Because of its generality,\nLeibniz\u2019s characteristica universalis stands out\ncompared with competing proposals by George Dalgarno (1661) and John\nWilkins (1668), which were obtained from \u201cchoice, nature and\nchance,\u201d and relied upon existing languages (ibid.,\n14\u201315).\n\n\nTrendelenburg, however, did not welcome all the elements of\nLeibniz\u2019s program. He heavily criticized its practical side, in\nparticular, calculation in logic. The connection of properties in a\nconcept is much more complicated than can be expressed with\nLeibniz\u2019s operations (ibid., 24). He recommended abstaining from\ncalculation (Trendelenburg 1857, 55):\n\n\nIf the side of calculus, invention and discovery is excluded from\ngeneral characteristic, there still remains an attractive logical task: [the\ntask of finding] a sign that distinguishes the elements and which is\ntherefore clear and avoids contradictions; [the task of] leading back\nthe intricate [intuition] to the simple contained in it. There remains the\ntask of finding a sign which is determined by the concept of the matter\nitself, like our number script. But such adequate sign presupposes an\nanalysis brought to an end and deepened down to the ground to become\npossible.\n\n\nTrendelenburg stresses that such analysis cannot be done given the\nstate of science of that time. If the characteristica\nuniversalis is not given up the still pending analytical formula\nhas to be replaced by arbitrary conjectures, a procedure which,\naccording to Trendelenburg, contradicts the idea and even the\npossibility of the intended calculation.\n\n\nErdmann\u2019s edition induced a second wave of reception. This\nreception is characterized by an interest in Leibniz\u2019s ideas on\nlogic. Its context was the reorganization of the philosophical scene\nafter Hegel\u2019s death (1831). This process was connected with a\ndiscussion of the so-called \u201cLogical Question\u201d, a term\ncreated by Adolf Trendelenburg (Trendelenburg 1842) who initiated these\ndebates. The discussions concerned the role of formal logic in the\nsystem of philosophy (cf. Peckhaus 1997, 130\u2013163; Peckhaus 1999;\nVilkko 2002, 56\u201381; Vilkko 2009). The authors aimed at overcoming\nHegel\u2019s identification of logic and metaphysics without\nre-establishing the old system of Aristotelian logic. The philosophical\ndominance of metaphysics was subsequently replaced by that of\nepistemology.\n\n\nTrendelenburg\u2019s comprehensive discussion was most significant,\nand his results are typical: He was interested in the\ncharacteristica universalis as a tool for knowledge\nrepresentation, although he stressed its utopian character. He had no\ninterest in the logical calculus due to a philosophical skepticism\ntowards mechanical tools. They cannot explain creativity and have no\nrelations to the predominant interest of philosophy in that time, namely\nthe fields of dynamical (temporal) logics which should help to model\nthe movement of thought (Denkbewegung).\n\n\nGiven the nature of Trendelenburg\u2019s presentation of the\nLeibnizian system, his significance for the mathematical reception of\nLeibniz\u2019s ideas in the context of the emergence of formal\nmathematics and mathematical logic in the second half of the 19th\ncentury is astonishing. Trendelenburg\u2019s paper on Leibniz\u2019s\nprogram of a general characteristic became a point of reference for\nlogical pioneers such as Gottlob Frege and Ernst Schr\u00f6der (on\ntheir controversy cf. Peckhaus 1997, 287\u2013296).\n\n",
