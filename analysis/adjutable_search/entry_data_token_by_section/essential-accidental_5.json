    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Essentialist Claims\n6. The Epistemology of Essentialist Claims\n\nAssuming that we have knowledge of some essentialist claims, how might\nwe account for that knowledge? For the purposes of the present\ndiscussion, let us assume that we know that being such that there are\ninfinitely many primes, being human, and originating from sperm\n\\(s\\) and egg \\(e\\) are essential properties of Socrates.\nThe first example is different from the last two in that it seems that\nwe can know a priori that being such that there are\ninfinitely many primes is essential to Socrates whereas it seems that\nwe can know only a posteriori that being human and\noriginating from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\) are also essential to\nhim.\n\nWhile it is a vexed philosophical issue just how to account for a\npriori knowledge of necessary truths such as logical truths,\nmathematical truths, and the homelier necessary truths like the truth\nthat nothing can be red all over and green all over at the same time,\naccounting for our knowledge of the necessary truth that Socrates is\nsuch that there are infinitely many primes, does not seem to be\nproblematic in some extra special way. If we had a good account of our\na priori knowledge of the necessary truth that there are\ninfinitely many primes, then it would take little more to account for\nour knowledge of the necessary truth about Socrates that he is such\nthat there are infinitely many primes.\n\nKripke (1972/1980) suggests that our knowledge of some other\nessentialist claims is based in part on a bit of a priori\nknowledge and in part on a bit of empirical knowledge. For example,\nour knowledge that originating from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\) is\nessential to Socrates is based in part on our a priori\nknowledge that every organism has its origin essentially and in part\non our empirical knowledge that Socrates (is an organism that)\noriginated from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\). (Similarly our knowledge\nthat Socrates is essentially human appears to be based in part on our\na priori knowledge that everything has its kind essentially\nand in part on our empirical knowledge that Socrates is (of the kind)\nhuman.) Thus, our knowledge of the claim that originating from\n\\(s\\) and \\(e\\) is essential to Socrates should be no more\nproblematic epistemologically than our knowledge of the two claims on\nwhich it is based and our knowledge of the validity of the argument\nfrom those two claims. As we have already mentioned, although there\nare difficult philosophical issues concerning our knowledge of logical\ntruths, our knowledge of the validity of the argument in question does\nnot seem to add any special problems of its own. Similarly, although\nthere are philosophical issues concerning empirical knowledge, our\nknowledge that Socrates originated from \\(s\\) and \\(e\\) does\nnot appear to add any special problems. However our a priori\nknowledge that every organism has its origin essentially does seem to\nhave special problems over and above the problems associated with\naccounting for our a priori knowledge of logic, mathematics,\nand the homelier necessary truths. The latter claims are generally\nsupported by universally held intuitions or by arguments that are\nuniversally accepted whereas the former, like most philosophical\nclaims, is supported by a less robust intuition and by a more\ncontroversial argument. To see in some detail how philosophers have\ngone about defending origin essentialism, see the\n\nSupplement on Arguments for Origin Essentialism.\n \n\nFor more about arguments for sortal essentialism, see Wiggins (1980)\nand Mackie (2006, chapters 7 and 8). The entry on\n the epistemology of modality\n is useful on general issues in modal epistemology.\n",
