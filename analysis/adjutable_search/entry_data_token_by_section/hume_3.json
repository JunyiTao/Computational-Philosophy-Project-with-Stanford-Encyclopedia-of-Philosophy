    "main_text": "Account of the Mind\n4. Account of the Mind\n\nTo explain the workings of our minds with the economy Newton displayed\nin his physics, Hume introduces the minimal amount of machinery he\nthinks is necessary to account for the mind\u2019s operations. Each\npiece is warranted by experience.\n\nThe early modern period was the heyday of the investigation of the\nideas of causation, moral good and evil, and many other\nphilosophically contested ideas. Every modern philosopher accepted\nsome version of the theory of ideas\u2014the view that we\nimmediately perceive certain mental entities called ideas,\nbut don\u2019t have direct access to physical objects. Hume holds an\nempiricist version of the theory, because he thinks that\neverything we believe is ultimately traceable to experience.\n\nHe begins with an account of perceptions, because he believes\nthat any intelligible philosophical question must be asked and\nanswered in those terms. He uses perception to designate any\nmental content whatsoever, and divides perceptions into two\ncategories, impressions and ideas.\n\nImpressions include sensations as well as\ndesires, passions, and emotions.\nIdeas are \u201cthe faint images of these in thinking and\nreasoning\u201d (T 1.1.1.1/1). He thinks everyone will recognize his\ndistinction, since everyone is aware of the difference between\nfeeling and thinking. It is the difference between\nfeeling the pain of your present sunburn and\nrecalling last year\u2019s sunburn.\n\nHume distinguishes two kinds of impressions: impressions of\nsensation, or original impressions, and impressions\nof reflection, or secondary impressions. Impressions of\nsensation include the feelings we get from our five senses as well as\npains and pleasures, all of which arise in us \u201coriginally, from\nunknown causes\u201d (T 1.1.2.1/7). He calls them original\nbecause trying to determine their ultimate causes would take us beyond\nanything we can experience. Any intelligible investigation must stop\nwith them.\n\nImpressions of reflection include desires, emotions, passions, and\nsentiments. They are essentially reactions or responses to ideas,\nwhich is why he calls them secondary. Your memories of last\nyear\u2019s sunburn are ideas, copies of the original impressions you\nhad when the sunburn occurred. Recalling those ideas causes you to\nfear that you\u2019ll get another sunburn this year, to\nhope that you won\u2019t, and to want to take\nproper precautions to avoid overexposure to the sun.\n\nPerceptions\u2014both impressions and ideas\u2014may be either\nsimple or complex. Complex impressions are made up\nof a group of simple impressions. My impression of the violet I just\npicked is complex. Among the ways it affects my senses are its\nbrilliant purple color and its sweet smell. I can separate and\ndistinguish its color and smell from the rest of my impressions of the\nviolet. Its color and smell are simple impressions, which can\u2019t\nbe broken down further because they have no component parts.\n\nHume initially distinguishes impressions and ideas in terms of their\ndegree of force and vivacity. Impressions are more\nforceful and vivacious than ideas. My impression of this ripe\ntomato\u2019s bright red color is as vivid as anything could be. Last\nyear\u2019s tomatoes were just as vivid when I was looking at them,\nbut now my idea of them is much less vivid than my impressions of the\ntomato in front of me. Since last year\u2019s tomatoes were the same\ncolor, the difference can\u2019t be that they are different shades of\nred; the difference must lie in the sharpness, clarity, and brightness\nof my impressions\u2014their force and vivacity. At\nvarious times, Hume tries other ways of characterizing the difference\nbetween impressions and ideas, but he was never completely satisfied\nwith them. Still, what he says works well enough to give us a handle\non the felt differences between impressions and ideas.\n\nWhen Hume distinguishes impressions and ideas in terms of their\nrelative force and vivacity, he is pointing out something that is\ngenerally true of them as a matter of fact. On occasion, in dreams or\na high fever, ideas may approach the force and vivacity of\nimpressions, but these are exceptions that prove\nthe\u2014empirical\u2014rule. In general, impressions and ideas are\nso different that no one can deny the distinction.\n\nAlthough nothing seems freer than the power of thought, which\nisn\u2019t \u201crestrained within the limits of nature and\nreality\u201d (EHU 2.4/18), Hume insists that our imagination is in\nfact \u201cconfined within very narrow limits\u201d. We can separate\nand combine our ideas in new and even bizarre ways, imagining\ncreatures we\u2019ve never seen or faraway galaxies, but all the\nmaterials of thinking are ultimately derived from our impressions.\nSince \u201call our ideas or more feeble perceptions are copies of\nour impressions or more lively ones\u201d; we are restricted to\n\u201ccompounding, transporting, augmenting, or diminishing the\nmaterials afforded us by the senses and experience\u201d (EHU\n2.5/19).\n",
