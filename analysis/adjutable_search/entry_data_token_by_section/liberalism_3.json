    "main_text": "The Debate About Liberty || Republican Liberty\n1.4 Republican Liberty\n\nAn older notion of liberty that has recently resurfaced is the\nrepublican, or neo-Roman, conception of liberty, which has roots in\nthe writings of Cicero and Niccolo Machiavelli (1950 [1513]).\nAccording to Philip Pettit,\n\nThe contrary of the liber, or free, person in Roman,\nrepublican usage was the servus, or slave, and up to at least\nthe beginning of the last century, the dominant connotation of\nfreedom, emphasized in the long republican tradition, was not having\nto live in servitude to another: not being subject to the arbitrary\npower of another (Pettit, 1996: 576).\n\n\nOn this view, the opposite of freedom is domination. To be unfree is\nto be \u201csubject to the potentially capricious will or the\npotentially idiosyncratic judgement of another\u201d (Pettit, 1997:\n5). The ideal liberty-protecting government, then, ensures that no\nagent, including the government, has arbitrary power over any citizen.\nThis is accomplished through an equal disbursement of power. Each\nperson has power that offsets the power of another to arbitrarily\ninterfere with her activities (Pettit, 1997: 67).\n\nThe republican conception of liberty is distinct from both Greenian\npositive and negative conceptions. Unlike Greenian positive liberty,\nrepublican liberty is not primarily concerned with rational autonomy,\nrealizing one\u2019s true nature, or becoming one\u2019s higher\nself. When all dominating power has been dispersed, republican\ntheorists are generally silent about these goals (Larmore 2001).\nUnlike negative liberty, republican liberty is primarily focused upon\n\u201cdefenseless susceptibility to interference, rather than actual\ninterference\u201d (Pettit, 1996: 577). Thus, in contrast to the\nordinary negative conception, on the republican conception the mere\npossibility of arbitrary interference is a limitation of\nliberty. Republican liberty thus seems to involve a modal claim about\nthe possibility of interference, and this is often cashed out in terms\nof complex counterfactual claims. It is not clear whether these claims\ncan be adequately explicated (Gaus, 2003; cf. Larmore, 2004).\n\nSome republican theorists, such as Quentin Skinner (1998: 113),\nMaurizio Viroli (2002: 6) and Pettit (1997: 8\u201311), view\nrepublicanism as an alternative to liberalism. When republican liberty\nis seen as a basis for criticizing market liberty and market society,\nthis is plausible (Gaus, 2003b). However, when liberalism is\nunderstood more expansively, and not so closely tied to either\nnegative liberty or market society, republicanism becomes\nindistinguishable from liberalism (Ghosh, 2008; Rogers, 2008; Larmore,\n2001; Dagger, 1997).\n",
