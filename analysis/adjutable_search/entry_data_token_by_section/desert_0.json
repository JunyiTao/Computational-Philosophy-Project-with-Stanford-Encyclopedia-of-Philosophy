    "main_text": "Desert and Entitlement\n1. Desert and Entitlement\n\nIt is important here at the outset that we draw attention to a\ndistinction between desert and another concept with which it\nmight be confused. We will speak of this latter concept as the concept\nof entitlement, though different philosophers use different\nterminology to mark this distinction. \n\nA typical desert claim is a claim to the effect that someone \u2013\nthe \u201cdeserver\u201d \u2013 deserves something \u2013 the\n\u201cdesert\u201d \u2013 in virtue of his or her possession of\nsome feature \u2013 the \u201cdesert\n base\u201d.[1]\n For example, consider the claim that a certain student deserves a\nhigh grade from her teacher in virtue of the fact that she did\nexcellent work in the course. A typical entitlement claim is a claim\nto the effect that someone is entitled to something from someone on\nsome basis. For example, consider the claim that a customer is\nentitled to a refund from a merchant in virtue of the fact that the\nmerchandise he purchased from that merchant had been sold with a\nguarantee and turned out to be defective. \n\nThere are obvious structural similarities between desert claims and\nclaims about entitlement. In typical examples of each sort, someone is\nsaid to deserve (or be entitled to) something from someone on some\nbasis. However, there is an important difference between the concepts\nof desert and entitlement. As the terminology is used here, desert is\na more purely normative concept, while entitlement is a sociological\nor empirical concept. If some social or legal institution is in place\nin your social group, and that institution has a rule that specifies\nsome treatment for those who have some feature, and you have the\nfeature, then you are entitled to that treatment. Thus, for example,\nsuppose that when the customer purchased a certain item, he received a\nlegally binding written guarantee from the seller. The guarantee\nspecified that if the item should turn out to be defective, the seller\nwould either replace the item or refund the money that the buyer had\nspent for the defective item. In such a case, if the buyer satisfies\nthe conditions stated in the guarantee, and the purchased item is\nindeed defective, the buyer is entitled to the refund or replacement.\n\n\nTypical desert claims have a similar structure, but do not always\ndepend in this way on the existence of laws or contracts or other\nsimilar social institutions. A person may deserve some sort of\ntreatment even though there are no rules in place in his society that\ncodify the conditions under which someone deserves that sort of\ntreatment. In such a case, a person may deserve something even though\nhe is not entitled to it. Similarly, a person may be entitled to\nsomething by some rules that are in place in his society even though\nhe does not deserve it. Some examples may help to make this\ndistinction clearer. \n\nConsider an example involving a wealthy grandfather and two\ngrandchildren. One grandchild is vicious and rich; the other is\nvirtuous and poor. The vicious grandchild never treated his\ngrandfather with respect. The virtuous grandchild was always\nrespectful and caring. Suppose the grandfather leaves his entire\nfortune to the vicious grandchild. As the terminology is used here, we\nmay want to describe the situation by saying that the vicious\ngrandchild is entitled to the fortune (the rules of the legal\nsystem are unambiguous on this point), but at the same time we may\nwant to say that he does not deserve it (he already has too\nmuch money; he is a rotten person who never treated his grandfather\nrespectfully). The virtuous grandchild may deserve at least\nsome of the inheritance, but he is not entitled to any of it.\n\n\nAnother example illustrates the same point. Suppose that an athlete\nhas her heart set on doing well in a competition. Suppose she has a\nlot of natural talent and trains diligently for a long time until she\nhas developed championship-level abilities in her sport. Suppose that\nthe training involves quite a bit of sacrifice on her part. Suppose\nthat at the last minute the competition is cancelled, and the athlete\nhas no opportunity to compete. Then we might say that this was a great\nmisfortune for her; she deserved to have a chance to\nparticipate. Unfortunately, there is no rule in the rulebook of the\nathlete\u2019s sport that says that those who have trained diligently\nare to get a chance to participate. Let us assume that there is no\ninstitution in place in the athlete\u2019s society that specifies\nthat those who train hard shall be given a chance to compete. In this\ncase, it would be wrong to say (using the terminology in the way that\nhas been specified) that the athlete is entitled to a chance\nto participate, yet we may still feel that she deserved the\nchance. This seems to be an example of a case in which someone has\ncompletely \u201cnon-institutional\u201d desert of something. \n\nSome philosophers use the expression \u2018pre-institutional\ndesert\u2019 where we use \u2018desert\u2019, and\n\u2018institutional desert\u2019 where we use\n\u2018entitlement\u2019. To avoid confusion, we will use\n\u2018desert\u2019 to refer to the relation that does not\nessentially involve the existence of social or legal institutions, and\n\u2018entitlement\u2019 to refer to the relation that does\nessentially involve the existence of such institutions. Our focus in\nthis article is on desert; we mention entitlement only as it bears on\ndesert. \n",
