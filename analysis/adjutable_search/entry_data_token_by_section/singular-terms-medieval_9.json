    "main_text": "Buridan\u2019s Theory of Singular Terms\n10. Proper Names and Identity through Time\n\n\nFurther issues to do with proper names arose from Buridan\u2019s discussion\nof identity through time in the last redaction of his commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics where he posed the question \u201cIs\nSocrates the same today that he was yesterday?\u201d In his answer,\nBuridan makes a careful distinction between three kinds of numerical\nidentity through time. In the strictest sense, being totally the same\nin number, no change of any kind is allowed, and so there are very few\nreal individuals, perhaps only God. In the less strict sense, being\npartially the same in number, the continuity of one part is\nsufficient. Socrates is the same Socrates despite bodily changes,\nbecause he has the same soul, but the human body will not retain its\nidentity through time, and neither will a horse. In the least strict\nsense of identity, being the same according to the continuity of\ndiverse parts succeeding one another, we find that animals, bodies,\nand rivers can be regarded as minimally the same through time. The\nSeine is the same river now as it was ten years ago because of the\ncontinuous succession of water-parts. This allows us to use the word\n\u2018Seine\u2019 as if it were a singular term in accordance with\nthe customary modes of speech.  It is important to note that we are\nallowed to retain singular concepts through memory, so I can keep the\nsame concept through time provided I have had the requisite original\nexperience of the individual in question.\n\n\nOne consequence of Buridan\u2019s account is that the names\n\u2018Socrates\u2019 and \u2018Aristotle\u2019 on the one hand and\n\u2018Seine\u2019 and \u2018Brownie\u2019 (the donkey) on the\nother have a different status. The former are more properly singular\nterms than the latter even for those who are acquainted with all of\nthese individuals through time. Domingo de Soto was strongly opposed\nto this consequence. He appealed to Aristotle\u2019s doctrines in order to\nargue that the continuity of soul is not the only condition for\nidentity of the second type, and that horses, trees and even rivers\ncould enjoy a strong enough identity, by virtue of the continuity of\ntheir forms and functions, to give a basis for the application of one\nsingular concept through time.\n\n\nAnother consequence of Buridan\u2019s account is found in some early\nsixteenth-century logicians whose reflection on the problem of\nidentity through time led them to adopt an even more restrictive\naccount of proper names than Buridan himself had countenanced, and one\nwhich has much in common with Roger Bacon\u2019s theory (see\n\u00a77). These logicians argued that a sequence of different concepts\nof Socrates will be formed through time, even by one acquainted with\nhim, and hence that the name \u2018Socrates\u2019 is no more a\nproper singular term than is the name \u2018Seine\u2019. It is\nradically equivocal, since at every moment it is subordinated to a\ndifferent concept. Nor is this incompatible with the intentions of the\nperson who originally gave Socrates his name. Strictly speaking, only\nthe baby was called Socrates, but the name was imposed equivalently or\nas a consequence to signify every successor to the boy by means of\ndifferent concepts. \n\n\n Once more, Domingo de Soto was strongly opposed. He said that to\nregard the name \u2018Socrates\u2019 as an equivocal term which\nrefers to a succession of individuals is a denial of common speech and\nof the common sense of the wise men who originally gave terms their\nsignification. Identity of the second type is sufficiently strong to\nbe the basis for one singular concept to be predicated non-ambiguously\nthrough time.\n",
