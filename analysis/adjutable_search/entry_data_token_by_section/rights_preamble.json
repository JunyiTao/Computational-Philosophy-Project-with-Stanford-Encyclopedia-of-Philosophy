    "main_text": "\n\nRights are entitlements (not) to perform certain actions, or (not) to\nbe in certain states; or entitlements that others (not) perform\ncertain actions or (not) be in certain states.\n\nRights dominate modern understandings of what actions are permissible\nand which institutions are just. Rights structure the form of\ngovernments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as many\nnow see it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of\nfreedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may,\nmust, and must not be done.\n\nThis entry begins by describing the nature of rights: their\nclassification, their composition, and their function. It then reviews\nthe history of the language of rights, and various relationships\nbetween rights and reasons. The major contemporary philosophical\napproaches to the justification of rights are compared, and the entry\nconcludes by surveying criticisms of rights and \u201crights\ntalk.\u201d The focus throughout is on general theoretical issues\n(what rights are) and not on arguments over specific rights (what\nrights there are). Those looking for fuller introductions to rights\nmay consider Jones (1994), Harel (2005), Campbell (2006), Ivison\n(2007) and Edmundson (2012).\n",
