    "main_text": "Measurement and Preparation\n7. Measurement and Preparation\nThe principles discussed above provide a resolution of\nthe measurement problem of quantum foundations: that is, how\nto discuss the measurement process itself in fully quantum mechanical\nterms. It is convenient to think of this as made up of two\nproblems:\n\n(M1)\n\nHow can the macroscopic outcome of the measurement,\ntraditionally thought of as a pointer position, be described in\nquantum terms?\n(M2)\n\nHow is this outcome related to the earlier microscopic property the\napparatus was designed to measure?\n\nThe reliable preparation of a microscopic system in a\nparticular quantum state raises similar conceptual issues; indeed,\nwhat in textbooks are often called \u201cmeasurements\u201d would be\nbetter thought of as \u201cpreparations\u201d. Both are discussed\nbelow.\n",
