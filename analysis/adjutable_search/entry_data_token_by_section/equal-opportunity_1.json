    "main_text": "Conceptions of Equality of Opportunity\n2. Conceptions of Equality of Opportunity\n\nEquality of Opportunity is contested (Joseph 1980; Gross 1987), and\ndifferent conceptions of Equality of Opportunity can be distinguished\nfrom one another according to the factors which are seen as\ninappropriate influences on persons\u2019 prospects for success. Take\na committee tasked with selecting between university admissions\napplications trying to determine the appropriate selection criteria\nwhilst honouring the requirement to ensure Equality of Opportunity for\nall candidates. One view amongst the committee could be that Equality\nof Opportunity is satisfied when there is no explicit race or sex\ndiscrimination in the selection process. A further view might be that\nthis is necessary but insufficient, and Equality of Opportunity is\nonly satisfied when legacy admissions, giving preferential treatment\nto family of alumni, are also disallowed. Others on the committee\nmight argue that although it is right that race, sex, and legacy\ndiscrimination should be ruled out in order to ensure Equality of\nOpportunity, the selection criteria should also take into account the\nsocial disadvantages which result in some candidates being better\nqualified than others. Their view is that selection criteria based on\nwhich candidates are best qualified means that socially disadvantaged\ncandidates do not enjoy relevantly equal opportunities to gain\nadmission. The different views voiced within the committee represent\ndifferent views about the factors which are inappropriate to consider\nwhen deciding who is selected and, in that way, they reflect different\nconclusions about what Equality of Opportunity requires. The broader\npoint, then, is that different conceptions of Equality of Opportunity\ndiffer regarding which factors render the \u201copportunity\u201d an\nunequal one.\n\nThe fact that conceptions of Equality of Opportunity differ in this\nway helps explain why the notion of Equality of Opportunity\nis contested. People take different views about which factors are\nmorally significant, and, in turn, which factors should or should not\naffect persons\u2019 prospects for a position or good. In that way,\nEquality of Opportunity can be seen as an essentially contested\nconcept (Gallie 1955). The widespread agreement that Equality of\nOpportunity is a good thing in fact conceals importantly different\nviews about what Equality of Opportunity actually consists in. The\nterm \u201copportunity\u201d in Equality of Opportunity indicates\nthat a good is in some sense available but not necessarily\nguaranteed. (Westen [1985: 839], for instance, suggests an\n\u201copportunity\u201d is less than a guarantee but more than a\nmere possibility.) Depending on one\u2019s conception of Equality of\nOpportunity, possessing an \u201copportunity\u201d may not, however,\nmean that one has any realistic prospect of attaining the position or\ngood in question (Mason 2006: 22\u201326). For instance, it might be\nclaimed of a given society that everyone enjoys the Equal Opportunity\nto become a professional athlete, given that there are no formal\nconstraints on eligibility, however there will be many for whom their\nphysical limitations make this wholly unrealistic (for discussion of\n\u201copportunity\u201d in relation to \u201cfreedom\u201d, see\nCampbell 1974\u201375). Cases such as this lead G. A. Cohen (1989:\n916\u2013917) to draw a distinction between Equality of Opportunity\nand Equality of Access. The thought here is that although we\ndon\u2019t normally say that someone lacks an opportunity\nsimply because their physical or mental capacities limit their ability\nto achieve something, we still need a\nterm\u2014\u201caccess\u201d\u2014with which to articulate\ninequalities that derive from those sources. On this view, although\nthere may be Equal Opportunity to become a professional athlete,\nphysical inequalities mean that there is unequal access to\nbecoming one. Cohen\u2019s recommendation notwithstanding, there are\nconceptions of Equality of Opportunity that do use the language of\n\u201copportunity\u201d to refer to such sources of inability. For\ninstance, it might be argued that demarcating separate categories for\nwomen\u2019s sports is a way of providing Equality of Opportunity for\nwomen in sport because an unsegregated category would deprive women of\nthe chance to compete on fair terms, given the physical differences\nbetween men and women (for a critique of this view, see Tannsjo 2007).\nOr it might be argued that the structure of sporting competition as a\nwhole (for instance, the range of available sports) should be\norganized so as to provide for a wider range of physical advantages so\nas to offer Equal Opportunity in sport (English 1978).\n\nThere is also disagreement over whether or not\n\u201copportunity\u201d ought to be understood as a subject\ndependent concept in the sense that an individual\u2019s values bear\non whether something qualifies as relevantly open. For instance,\nParekh (2000: 241) argues that something fails to qualify as an\nopportunity in the relevant sense if taking that path involves\ntransgressing a person\u2019s deeply held commitments\u2014such as\nan orthodox Jew being required to take off their yarmulke as a\nprecondition for doing a certain job. On the other hand, Brian Barry\n(2001: 36\u201338) contends that the range of opportunities a person\nfaces is a matter of the \u201cobjective state of affairs\u201d and\nnot dependent on the values of the person facing those opportunities\nand the choices they make between them. What this indicates, then, is\nthat \u201copportunity\u201d is really a placeholder for the idea\nthat certain factors should not obstruct the availability of a good or\na person\u2019s prospects for success (even if other factors, deemed\nlegitimate, render the good unavailable).\n\nThis way of thinking about different conceptions of Equality of\nOpportunity suggests that the range of different conceptions of\nEquality of Opportunity is very broad indeed. Each conception will be\ndistinctive depending on which constellation of factors is deemed to\nobstruct the prospects of success in a way that renders the\nopportunities unequal. One way of roughly ordering different\nconceptions of Equality of Opportunity on a continuum of sorts is,\ntherefore, to situate them according to the breadth of factors which\nobstruct Equality of Opportunity. Conceptions which identify\nrelatively few factors which obstruct Equality of Opportunity will be\nat one end of the continuum, with conceptions identifying a larger\nnumber of factors towards the other end (for this broad approach to\norganizing conceptions of Equality of Opportunity, see Cohen 2009:\n4\u20136; Miller 2013: 118\u2013119; Segall 2013: 3\u20134; Swift\n2014: 102\u2013109). Although imprecise, this is a useful way of\ndistinguishing thinner, formal conceptions of Equality of Opportunity\nfrom thicker, more substantial ones.\n",
