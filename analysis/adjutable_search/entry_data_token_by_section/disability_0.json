    "main_text": "Models of Disability\n1. Models of Disability\n\nMany different characteristics have been considered disabilities.\nParaplegia, deafness, blindness, diabetes, autism, epilepsy,\ndepression, and HIV have all been classified as\n\u201cdisabilities\u201d. The term covers such diverse conditions as\nthe congenital absence or adventitious loss of a limb or a sensory\nfunction; progressive neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis;\nchronic diseases like arteriosclerosis; the inability or limited\nability to perform such cognitive functions as remembering faces or\ncalculating sums; and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and\nbipolar disorder.\n\nDisabilities like these have been objects of study in sociology,\nmedicine, and policy debates for much longer than they have been\nsubjects of sustained interest in philosophy. These discourses do not\ntend to define \u201cdisability\u201d by way of the sort of rigorous\nnecessary and sufficient conditions philosophers often prefer. But\nthey have been centrally concerned with broadly definitional issues,\noften discussed under the heading of \u201cmodels\u201d of\ndisability\u2014that is, general theoretical perspectives concerned\nto say what in the world social scientists are investigating when they\ninvestigate disability. These models generally pick out, both (1) a\nset of phenomenon as what needs explaining, when we explain\ndisability, phenomenon typically but not necessarily characterized as\ndisadvantages; and (2) an explanation of these\nphenomenon\u2014again, typically, but not solely, an explanation of\nwhy disabled people experience the disadvantages they do.\n",
