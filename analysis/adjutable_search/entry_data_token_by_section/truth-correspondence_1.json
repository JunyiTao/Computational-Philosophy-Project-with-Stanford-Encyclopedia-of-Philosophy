    "main_text": "History of the Correspondence Theory || Metaphysical and Semantic Versions\n1.1 Metaphysical and Semantic Versions\n\n\nIn medieval authors we find a division between\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d and \u201csemantic\u201d versions of the\ncorrespondence theory. The former are indebted to the\ntruth-as-likeness theme suggested by Aristotle\u2019s overall views,\nthe latter are modeled on Aristotle\u2019s more austere definition\nfrom Metaphysics 1011b25.\n\n\nThe metaphysical version presented by Thomas Aquinas is the\nbest known: \u201cVeritas est adaequatio rei et\nintellectus\u201d (Truth is the equation of thing and\nintellect), which he restates as: \u201cA judgment is said to be true\nwhen it conforms to the external reality\u201d. He tends to use\n\u201cconformitas\u201d and\n\u201cadaequatio\u201d, but also uses\n\u201ccorrespondentia\u201d, giving the latter a more\ngeneric sense (De Veritate, Q.1, A.1-3; cf. Summa\nTheologiae, Q.16). Aquinas credits the Neoplatonist Isaac Israeli\nwith this definition, but there is no such definition in\nIsaac. Correspondence formulations can be traced back to the Academic\nskeptic Carneades, 2nd century B.C., whom Sextus Empiricus\n(Adversos Mathematicos, vii, 168) reports as having taught\nthat a presentation \u201cis true when it is in accord\n(symphonos) with the object presented, and false when it is\nin discord with it\u201d. Similar accounts can be found in various\nearly commentators on Plato and Aristotle (cf. K\u00fcnne 2003,\nchap. 3.1), including some Neoplatonists: Proklos (In Tim.,\nII 287, 1) speaks of truth as the agreement or adjustment\n(epharmoge) between knower and the known. Philoponus (In\nCat., 81, 25-34) emphasizes that truth is neither in the things\nor states of affairs (pragmata) themselves, nor in the\nstatement itself, but lies in the agreement between the two. He gives\nthe simile of the fitting shoe, the fit consisting in a relation\nbetween shoe and foot, not to be found in either one by itself. Note\nthat his emphasis on the relation as opposed to its relata is laudable\nbut potentially misleading, because x\u2019s truth (its being\ntrue) is not to be identified with a relation, R, between x\nand y, but with a general relational property of x,\ntaking the form (\u2203y)(xRy &\nFy). Further early correspondence formulations can be found in\nAvicenna (Metaphysica, 1.8-9) and Averroes (Tahafut,\n103, 302). They were introduced to the scholastics by William of\nAuxerre, who may have been the intended recipient of Aquinas\u2019\nmistaken attribution (cf. Boehner 1958; Wolenski 1994).\n\n\nAquinas\u2019 balanced formula \u201cequation of thing and\nintellect\u201d is intended to leave room for the idea that\n\u201ctrue\u201d can be applied not only to thoughts and judgments\nbut also to things or persons (e.g. a true friend). Aquinas explains\nthat a thought is said to be true because it conforms to\nreality, whereas a thing or person is said to be true because\nit conforms to a thought (a friend is true insofar as, and because,\nshe conforms to our, or God\u2019s, conception of what a friend ought\nto be). Medieval theologians regarded both, judgment-truth as well as\nthing/person-truth, as somehow flowing from, or grounded in, the\ndeepest truth which, according to the Bible, is God: \u201cI am the\nway and the truth and the life\u201d (John 14, 6). Their attempts to\nintegrate this Biblical passage with more ordinary thinking involving\ntruth gave rise to deep metaphysico-theological reflections. The\nnotion of thing/person-truth, which thus played a very important role\nin medieval thinking, is disregarded by modern and contemporary\nanalytic philosophers but survives to some extent in existentialist\nand continental philosophy.\n\n\nMedieval authors who prefer a semantic version of the\ncorrespondence theory often use a peculiarly truncated formula to\nrender Aristotle\u2019s definition: A (mental) sentence is true if\nand only if, as it signifies, so it is (sicut significat, ita\nest). This emphasizes the semantic relation\nof signification while remaining maximally elusive about what\nthe \u201cit\u201d is that is signified by a true sentence and\nde-emphasizing the correspondence relation (putting it into the little\nwords \u201cas\u201d and \u201cso\u201d). Foreshadowing a favorite\napproach of the 20th century, medieval semanticists like Ockham\n(Summa Logicae, II) and Buridan (Sophismata, II)\ngive exhaustive lists of different truth-conditional clauses for\nsentences of different grammatical categories. They refrain from\nassociating true sentences in general with items from a single\nontological category. (Cf. Moody 1953; Adams McCord 1987; Perler\n2006.)\n\n\nAuthors of the modern period generally convey the impression that the\ncorrespondence theory of truth is far too obvious to merit much, or\nany, discussion. Brief statements of some version or other can be\nfound in almost all major writers; see e.g.: Descartes 1639, ATII 597;\nSpinoza, Ethics, axiom vi; Locke, Essay, 4.5.1;\nLeibniz, New Essays, 4.5.2; Hume, Treatise, 3.1.1;\nand Kant 1787, B82. Berkeley, who does not seem to offer any account\nof truth, is a potentially significant exception. Due to the influence\nof Thomism, metaphysical versions of the theory are much more popular\nwith the moderns than semantic versions. But since the moderns\ngenerally subscribe to a representational theory of the mind (the\ntheory of ideas), they would seem to be ultimately committed to\nspelling out relations like correspondence or conformity in terms of a\npsycho-semantic representation relation holding between ideas, or\nsentential sequences of ideas (Locke\u2019s \u201cmental\npropositions\u201d), and appropriate portions of reality, thereby\neffecting a merger between metaphysical and semantic versions of the\ncorrespondence theory.\n",
