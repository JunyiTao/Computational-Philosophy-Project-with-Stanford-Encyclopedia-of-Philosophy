Following\nthe cessation of the Napoleonic Wars in 1814\u201315, extensive new\ncontacts developed between French and British scientists, particularly\nthrough Edinburgh (Corsi 2021, Jenkins 2011). In addition to French\nconnections, there were also important personal contacts between\nGerman and British scientists that also included the introduction of\nGerman progressive developmentalism and transcendental anatomy in the\nearly decades of the nineteenth century both through Edinburgh, and\nalso directly into London scientific circles. The recognition of these\nnew introductions of French and German science and intellectual\ntraditions into the British Isles, particularly moving through medical\ncontexts, has supplied a new framework for understanding the\nreflections on species change in Britain in the period before the\nadvent of Darwin\u2019s work (Rupke 2009; R. J. Richards 2002; Sloan,\n2003, 1992b; Desmond 1989).\n\nThe Edinburgh comparative anatomist, Robert Edmond Grant (1793\u2013\n1874), played an important role in introducing the French discussions\ninto the British Isles. He would also serve as Charles Darwin\u2019s\nfirst mentor in science when Darwin was a young medical student at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh (1825\u201327). Grant was directly engaged\nwith the issues being debated at the time between Geoffroy St.\nHilaire, Cuvier and Lamarck, and he advocated a variant of a\nLamarckian-Geoffroyean transformism in his writings, themes expounded\nin his lectures on comparative anatomy at the new University College,\nLondon where he became the first professor of comparative anatomy in\n1827 (Desmond 1989). In addition to Grant, several other naturalists\nin Edinburgh brought French discussions into the British context\n(Corsi 2021, Jenkins 2011).\n4.3.1 The Lyellian Critique of Lamarckism\n\nThese French-inspired discussions of transformism entering mainly\nthrough Edinburgh were subjected to a powerful critique by the Scots\nlawyer turned geologist, Charles Lyell (1797\u20131875). In a\ndiscussion that occupied seventeen of eighteen chapters (282 pages) of\nthe second volume (1832) of his landmark three-volume Principles\nof Geology (1830\u201333), Lyell subjected Lamarckian theory to\na multi-level critique that was to influence much of the subsequent\nopposition to transformism in British circles, and posed a wide range\nof issues that Charles Darwin had to overcome subsequently. \n\nOpening with five chapters that analyzed Lamarck\u2019s assumptions\nabout species instability and summarizing his causal explanations of\nboth the serial ascent of life and the plasticity of form and function\nunder the influence of internal causes, Lyell developed a withering\nattack on Lamarckism. In this discussion he questioned the empirical\nevidence for species transformism, both in terms of evidence from\nnatural species, and also the warrant that could be drawn from changes\nthat have been produced in domestic animals and plants by human\nactivity. Moving beyond this, he then questioned the evidence for\nconnections of living forms across biogeographical regions, and the\nevidence for substantial change in historical migrations between zones\nof habitation. \n\nA second level of critique concerned the evidence assumed by Lamarck\n(and Geoffroy) for historical progressionism in the forms of life,\nwith oldest rocks showing simplest forms, and subsequent geological\nformations (Secondary, Tertiary) showing the appearance of higher and\nmore complex forms eventually resulting in the mammals. This theme of\ngeological progress, embraced not only by transformists, but also by\nBritish disciples of Cuvier, was attacked by Lyell with an argument\nthat would later be used by Darwin to different ends\u2014the\nimperfection of the geological record. In Lyell\u2019s view, the\naccidents of fossilization undercut any inference from the fossil\nrecord concerning an assumption of the historical development of life.\nAgainst speculations of Lamarck and others concerning evidence for a\nprogression from simpler forms to those now existing, Lyell replies\nwith reference to plant evidence that,\n\n\nThose naturalists, therefore, who infer that the ancient flora of the\nglobe was, at certain periods, less varied than now, merely because\nthey have as yet discovered only a few hundred fossil species of a\nparticular epoch, while they can enumerate more than fifty thousand\nliving ones, are reasoning on a false basis\u2026: (Lyell 1832\n[1991], 245; see also p. 20).\n\n\nIn examining these issues, Lyell concludes that empirical evidence\nonly supports a claim of limited transformations of a varietal level\nthat remains within natural species boundaries. In Lyell\u2019s\nconclusion, there was no empirical support for the transfomism of\nspecies.\n4.3.2: German Philosophy of Nature and British Developmentalism\n\nIn addition to French-inspired developments of transformism that Lyell\nfocused on in his critique of Lamarck, a lesser-studied introduction\nof German philosophy of nature and German reflections on anatomical\nresemblance formed a different current of reflection with significant\nconsequences for the mid-nineteenth century discussions of the\ntransformist question in the British Isles. The cessation of the\nNapoleonic hostilities was accompanied by the introduction into\nBritish discussions of German scientific thought along with\nexpositions of the systematic philosophies of Kant, Fichte, Hegel and\nSchelling (Sloan 2003). With relevance to species transformism,\nSchelling-inspired themes in the philosophy of nature were expounded\nin the Hunterian Lectures in Comparative Anatomy at the Royal College\nof Surgeons in London, delivered by the British surgeon Joseph Henry\nGreen (1791\u20131863). Green utilized dimensions of\nSchelling\u2019s Naturphilosophie to develop in his lectures\nbetween 1820\u201327 a dynamic theory of group relations which\nsynthesized the work of Lamarck, Cuvier, and the University of\nG\u00f6ttingen medical theorist Johann Blumenbach (1752\u20131840\n(Sloan, 1992b, 2007), relations which he even depicted in tree-like\nbranchings of relationship that went beyond those of Lamarck.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Joseph Henry Green\u2019s\ndiagram of the relations of the invertebrate and vertebrate groups in\n1827 as represented in the notes of Richard Owen. [An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\nThese themes would be continued in the major series of lectures\ndelivered by Green\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at the College of\nSurgeons, the comparative anatomist, Richard Owen (1804\u201392), who\nwas named to the prestigious Hunterian Chair in Comparative Anatomy\n1837 and remained in that position until 1856 (Rupke 1994, 1993; Sloan\n1992b) \n\nOwen\u2019s widely-attended London lectures delivered between 1837\nand 1856 brought many of the issues of comparative anatomy,\nclassication, fossil evidence, and embryology to bear on the questions\nof species relationship and change. In these lectures, presented\nagainst the backdrop of the massive anatomical collections of the\nHunterian Museum in London, Owen developed a reinterpretation of the\nsignificance of the Cuvier-Geoffroy dispute and developed its\nimplications for issues surrounding the historical development of the\nvertebrates as represented in this diagram he made in 1837. \n\n\n\nFigure 3: Richard Owen\u2019s\nrepresentation of the relation of the main animal groups in February,\n1837. [An\n extended description of figure 3\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\nAs a solution to the Cuvier-Geoffroy issues, Owen subsequently\ndeveloped in his Hunterian lectures in 1845 the theory of the\narchetypal vertebrate that connected the anatomical relations of all\nthe vertebrates, a theme he then elaborated in an important set of\npublications in 1847 and 1849 (Owen, 1847, 1849 [2007]). Employing\naspects of William Whewell\u2019s philosophy of science to develop\nthese arguments, Owen expounded the theory of the unity of type in\nrelation to the Cuvierian analysis of the relation of form and\nfunction. In his argument, the archetype, functioning both as a\ntranscendental ideal form and also as an immanent law working in the\nmaterial history of life, explained the progression and\ndifferentiation of the vertebrates in historical time ((Sloan 2003; R.\nJ. Richards 2002: chp. 14; Rupke 1993). \n\n\n\nFigure 4: Richard Owen\u2019s depiction\nof the Archetypal Vertebrate, composed of a series of ideal vertebrae\nas in his On the Nature of the Limbs (1849),\n\u201cAppendix\u201d. [An\n extended description of figure 4\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\nBy means of this theory, Owen claimed he could coherently explain both\nthe deep resemblance of forms in their internal anatomy\u2014the\ntheme emphasized by Geoffroy St. Hilaire\u2014, and also the close\nfitting of structure and function to the organism\u2019s\n\u201cconditions of existence\u201d, the insight emphasized by\nCuvier.\n\nTo distinguish these two meanings of relationship, Owen introduced\ninto the literature in 1843 a crucial distinction between resemblances\nof \u201chomology\u201d, meaning the presence of the\n\u201csame\u201d parts in every variety of form and\nfunction\u2014Geoffroyean relationships\u2014and those of\n\u201canalogy\u201d, denoting solely the similarity of parts in\ntheir functional adaptations\u2014Cuvierian relationships. Developing\nthis concept of homology in relation to his theory of the archetype,\nOwen claimed he could at last give a coherent meaning to the concept\nof \u201csameness\u201d in anatomical relationships\u2014the\nwarrant for speaking, for example, of a \u201cfemur\u201d in a bird\nand a mammal as the \u201csame\u201d bone in different forms and\nfunctions. Furthermore, as Owen developed this theory in relation to\nhis work on the fossil record, the theory of the archetype, conceived\nalso as an immanent law working in history, led Owen to embrace a\nconcept of branching and diversifying relations of forms in history as\ndivergences from this ideal archetypal form over time\n (fig. 3\n above). Owen thus broke with the linear historical progressionism\nfrom simple to complex assumed in several transformist theories. \n\nOn the other hand, Owen\u2019s model cannot be considered to\nrepresent genuine species transformism\u2014species do not change\nhistorically one into another and the archetype exists as a\nquasi-Newtonian ideal \u201claw\u201d governing development in time\nrather than designating an actual historical form that materially has\ngiven rise to successive forms displaying homologous relationships.\nNonetheless, his integration of comparative anatomy, paleontology, and\neven embryology into this framework, set out a sophisticated model of\nrelationship that was later reinterpreted by Darwin from the viewpoint\nof his theory of material derivation from common historical\nancestors.\n4.3.3 Popular Transformism in Britain, 1844\u20131859\n\nOn a more popular level, species transformism was broadly popularized\nin pre-Darwinian Anglophone discussions by the appearance in 1844 of\nthe grand evolutionary cosmology put forth anonymously by the Scottish\npublisher Robert Chambers (1802\u201371) in his immensely popular\nVestiges of the Natural History of Creation (Chambers\n1844[1994]), a work which in many respects prepared Victorian society\nin England, as well as pre-Civil War America, for Darwin\u2019s more\nrestricted theory of 1859 (Secord 2000; MacPherson, 2015). More\nsimilar to Buffon\u2019s Epochs of Nature than to the\nwritings of Lamarck, Chambers proposed an evolutionary schema that\nbegan with the nebular beginnings of the cosmos, the geological\nhistory of the earth interpreted as a progression of ages, accompanied\nby a historical progression of life from simple to complex, the cosmos\nmoved in a teleological direction up to humanity, with a broad\nevolution of species up the chain of being. In this grand schema he\nincorporated insights from French zoology and geological\nprogressionism, ignoring the refutations of this by Lyell, with all of\nthis working under the actions of one great unifying natural law that\ndemonstrated a great divine design of nature. This vision was further\npopularized by its incorporation into Alfred Lord Tennyson\u2019s\nepic poem In Memoriam (1850). In spite of the popularity of\nChamber\u2019s work, which went through eleven editions by the end of\nthe nineteenth century and sold more copies than Darwin\u2019s\nOrigin of Species, the British scientific community was\nessentially unanimous in its rejection of Chamber\u2019s\nspeculations, with Lyellian and Cuvierian critiques forming a solid\nscientific basis for these arguments. In many ways this opposition to\nthe Vestiges by leading members of the Victorian scientific\nestablishment formed one primary source of professional resistance to\nthe later Darwinian theory (see entry on Darwin: From the Origin\nof Species to the Descent of Man, Section 3).\n\nA more philosophically influential developmental evolutionism was also\nadvocated in pre-Darwinian England by the British railway engineer and\npublic intellectual, Herbert Spencer (1820\u20131903)\n (Herbert Spencer).\n Inspired both by the expositions of Lamarckianism by Charles Lyell in\nthe second volume of his Principles of Geology\n(1830\u201333), by the writings of Karl Ernst von Baer on\nembryological development, and also by Richard Owen\u2019s Hunterian\nLectures on the osteology of the vertebrate skeleton, which Spencer\nattended in 1851 (Rupke 1994: 206), Spencer entered the British\ndiscussions of transformism in 1852 with his endorsement of the\n\u201cdevelopment hypothesis\u201d (Spencer 1852). This initiated\nhis broad reflections on the law-governed evolution of society and\nhumanity, developed in detail in such works as First\nPrinciples, published in 1862 (Haines 1988). Prior to the use of\nthe term by Darwin, Spencer spoke of the \u201cevolution\u201d of\nlife and the cosmos from material beginnings, with species changing as\na result of the operation of natural forces. It was also from Spencer\nthat Darwin borrowed the designator \u201csurvival of the\nfittest\u201d as a synonym for his own \u201cnatural\nselection\u201d in the fifth edition of the Origin of\nSpecies in 1869. Although Spencer\u2019s First\nPrinciples appeared after the publication of Darwin\u2019s\nOrigin, Spencer\u2019s transformism was developed generally\nindependently of Darwin\u2019s work and shows closest affinity with\nthe reflections of Lamarck, Chambers, and the historical\ndevelopmentalism of Owen.\n\nSpencer, rather than Darwin, has often been seen as the primary\ntheoretician of \u201csocial\u201d Darwinism in the late nineteenth\nand early twentieth centuries (Hofstadter 1944 [1955]; see also the\nentry on Herbert Spencer). Spencer\u2019s world-wide influence even\nmade his works a vehicle by which Darwinism was first introduced into\nnon-Western discussions (Jin 2019, 2020; Lightman (ed.) 2016; Elshakry\n2013; Pusey 1983). This unusual juxtapositioning of Spencer and Darwin\nis explored in the entry\n Darwin: From the Origin of Species to the Descent of Man\n (Section 3.1).\n",
