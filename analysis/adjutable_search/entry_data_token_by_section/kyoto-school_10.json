    "main_text": "Absolute Nothingness: Giving Philosophical Form to the Formless || Ueda\u2019s Two-layered World: Linguistic Horizons within the Empty-Expanse\n3.6 Ueda\u2019s Two-layered World: Linguistic Horizons within the Empty-Expanse\n\nUeda Shizuteru was a student of Nishitani\u2019s who became a\nrenowned Eckhart scholar as well as a scholar and lay master of Zen\n(see M\u00fcller et al. 2022). For decades he was also at the center\nof the revival of Nishida studies that began in the 1980s. Like\nNishitani, Ueda explicitly orients himself to and from the standpoint\nof Zen and takes a topological, phenomenological, and existential\napproach to the idea of absolute nothingness (Ueda 2011c). Following\nin the tradition of the Kyoto School\u2019s dialogue with Western\nphilosophers, in one of his influential works Ueda engages the work of\nHusserl, Heidegger and other phenomenologists to articulate a\nreligiously charged philosophy of what he calls \u201ctwofold\nbeing-in-the-world\u201d (nij\u016bsekainaisonzai) (USS IX;\nsee also D\u00f6ll 2011, 2020; Krummel 2022).\n\nWhile the first layer in which the self is located is the historical\nhorizon of the everyday life-world, this horizon itself is ultimately\nfound to rest in an absolutely \u201cempty-expanse,\u201d a place of\nabsolute nothingness that both enfolds the everyday world as well as\ngrounds the radical freedom of the individual \u201cself-negating\nself\u201d (see USS IX, 22\u201324 and 324ff.). Ueda finds this idea\nof returning, by way of absolute self-negation, to a primordial\nwellspring of existence that is \u201cempty and free\u201d\n(ledig und frei) in Meister Eckhart, and, in an even more\nrarified form, in Zen Buddhism (see Davis 2008a). It is from the\nlatter that he borrows the term \u201cempty-expanse\u201d\n(kok\u016b) as a topological expression for\n\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101.\n\nFor Ueda, then, the two-layered-world is inhabited by a\ntwo-layered-self. This is how Ueda understands what Nishitani referred\nto as a \u201cself that is not a self.\u201d The self, as\nbeing-in-the-world, ultimately realizes itself in a moment of absolute\nself-negation where it dies to itself and stands as a\n\u201cnon-ego\u201d or \u201chollow-being\u201d in the\n\u201chollow-expanse\u201d which envelops the horizonal life-world.\nThe true self, as a self that becomes itself by passing through the\nabsolute negation of its ego, is thus a two-layered\nbeing-in-and-beyond-the-world; it stands in the horizon of the world\nwhich, in turn, rests in the empty-expanse of absolute\nnothingness.\n\nThis empty- or hollow-expanse is, to be sure, beyond conceptual\nunderstanding, insofar as concepts have as their medium the world of\nlanguage and its determinations of meaning. Nevertheless, what lies\nbeyond the reach of language is not to be understood as an ineffable\nmystical realm to which one ascends and remains, but rather is to be\nexperienced in extreme moments from the limits of language as that\nwhich at once tears through and mends, exceeds and encompasses,\ntranscends and transforms our linguistic horizons of intelligibility.\nInsofar as we do not close in on ourselves and rigidify our linguistic\ndelimitations of the world, we can open ourselves up to the silence of\nthis surrounding expanse of unlimited openness, which in turn allows\nus to speak and act more freely and responsibly in our worlds of\nlinguistic significance (see Ueda 2011b).\n",
