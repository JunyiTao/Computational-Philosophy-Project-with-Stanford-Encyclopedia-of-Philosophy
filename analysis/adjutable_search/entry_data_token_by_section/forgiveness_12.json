    "main_text": "Theories of Forgiveness || Performative Accounts\n5.5 Performative Accounts\n\nThe views of forgiveness canvassed thus far have, by and large,\nfocused on forgiveness as a private phenomenon, involving, for\nexample, a change in emotion. But another strand of thinking attends\nto our social and linguistic practices related to forgiveness, most\nnotably, our practice of saying \u201cI forgive you\u201d or some\ncognate expression. Joram Haber argued that the question \u201cWhat\nis forgiveness?\u201d is best answered, \u201cin the context of what\nspeakers mean when they employ the term\u201d (1991: 53), even if\nthere are other ways to forgive besides uttering \u201c\u2018I\nforgive you\u2019\u201d (1991: 40). According to Haber,\nunderstanding forgiveness requires discovering what one does when one\nperforms the linguistic act of expressing forgiveness, typically by\nway of the utterance, \u201cI forgive you\u201d (1991: 29).\n\nTo see what Haber and his followers have in mind, we need a bit of\nbackground. J.L. Austin (1975) called attention to two ways to\nunderstand what we do when we speak. In the first instance, we can\nthink of an utterance simply as a locutionary act, which is\nsimply the act of uttering a sentence with a certain sense and\nreference. But we do not typically utter sentences simply for the sake\nof uttering sentences. We also ask questions, make demands, warn of\nthreats, persuade detractors, express our preferences, inter\nalia. Austin suggested that in addition to the performance of the\nact of uttering a sentence, we may also perform an act\nin uttering a sentence, what he called illocutionary\nacts. Consider the sentence \u201cI would like a ham\nsandwich\u201d. The locutionary act is the utterance of the sentence\nitself. The illocutionary act might be one of simply communicating a\ndesire, or it might be one of (in a different context) ordering a\nsandwich at the deli counter.\n\nOne way to examine what a speaker does when one says \u201cI forgive\nyou\u201d is therefore to ask what illocutionary acts one performs\nwhen one does so. Haber focuses on a class of illocutionary acts that\nAustin called behabitives, \n\n\nwhich include the notion of reaction to other people\u2019s behavior\nand fortunes and of attitudes and expressions of attitudes to someone\nelse\u2019s past conduct or imminent conduct. (Austin 1975: 160) \n\n\nExamples of locutions with behabitive force include statements like,\n\u201cI applaud you\u201d and \u201cI commend you\u201d, which\nserve to express or exhibit the speaker\u2019s attitude about the\nconduct of the intended audience. Understood as a behabitive, \u201cI\nforgive you\u201d functions as an illocutionary act that communicates\nto the audience that the speaker possesses certain attitudes about\nher. Haber suggests that for S to say \u201cI forgive\nyou\u201d to X regarding some act A of\nX\u2019s, S represents (among other things) that\n(S) has overcome his resentment for X\u2019s doing\nA, or is at least willing to try to overcome it (1991: 40).\nBuilding on Haber\u2019s account, Glen Pettigrove argues that when a\nspeaker says \u201cI forgive you\u201d, she reveals three facts\nabout herself: (1) that the speaker believes that she has been wronged\nby the one to whom she speaks; (2) that the speaker has an absence of\nhostile reactive attitudes that might have arisen in response to the\nwrongdoing; and (3) that the speaker has some degree of positive\nregard for the one she addresses (2004a: 379).\n\nSpeech acts may also function as commissives, which have the\nillocutionary force of committing the speaker to an action or a course\nof conduct. One might say, \u201cI promise to buy you a tangerine\ntomorrow\u201d, or \u201cI will never lie to you again\u201d. In\ndoing so, the speaker places herself under an obligation to do (or not\ndo) what she says she will do (or not do). Pettigrove claims that in\naddition to functioning as a behabitive, \u201cI forgive you\u201d\ncan also function as a commissive by committing the speaking to\nforswear hostile reactive attitudes and retaliation toward the\nwrongdoer and to treat her with an appropriate level of benevolence\n(2004a: 385).\n\nUsed as a declarative, utterances or expressions may have the\neffect of (to put it crudely) changing reality in various ways. An\nappropriate authority might, for example, say, \u201cI christen this\nship\u201d, or \u201cI hereby find you guilty\u201d. By making such\nan utterance, one is actually able to make it so that a ship\nis christened or that one is found guilty. Understood as a\ndeclarative, the utterance \u201cI forgive you\u201d (or one of its\ncognates) makes it the case that one has been forgiven, thereby\naltering the operative norms governing the interaction between victim\nand wrongdoer (Warmke 2016a, 2016b). Much like one can declare a debt\nforgiven (or a criminal pardoned), one can declare that one has been\nforgiven by sincerely saying something like \u201cI forgive\nyou\u201d (Swinburne 1989). Such a declaration could release a\nwrongdoer from certain kinds of personal obligations to the victim\n(such as further apology or restitution, remorse or penance) (Nelkin\n2013). It might also function as a way for the victim to relinquish\ncertain rights or permissions to continue blaming the wrongdoer\n(Warmke 2016b).\n\nThree clarifications about performative accounts are in order. First,\none need not think that performative forgiveness possesses only one\nkind of illocutionary force. Pettigrove (2004a, 2012), for example,\nargues that \u201cI forgive you\u201d can function as both a\nbehabitive and commissive. Some hold that it can function as a\nbehabitive, commissive, and declarative (Warmke 2016b). Second,\ndefenders of performative accounts need not hold that acts of\nforgiveness qua performative, must always function in the\nsame way, for it might be that even if \u201cthe language of\nforgiveness is quite often put to a performatory use, and it is not\nalways put to the same performatory use\u201d (Neblett 1974: 269; cf.\nPettigrove 2012: 17\u20138). It may be that sometimes \u201cI\nforgive you\u201d functions only as a behabitive, and other times\nalso as a commissive. Third, defenders of performative accounts need\nnot think that only speech acts (e.g., utterances of \u201cI\nforgive you\u201d) can fulfill the performative functions of\nforgiving. Cognate communicative acts, gestures, and facial\nexpressions may achieve the same result (Swinburne 1989: 85).\n",
