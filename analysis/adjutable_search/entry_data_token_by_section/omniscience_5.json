    "main_text": "Further Difficulties for Omniscience || Omniscience and Knowledge de se\n4.2 Omniscience and Knowledge de se\nKretzmann (1966) raised a second problem for omniscience. He held that each of us possesses special \u201cfirst-person\u201d knowledge, knowledge not available to anyone else. He illustrates this with the example of what Jones knows when he knows that he himself is in the hospital. What Jones knows is not simply the proposition that Jones is in the hospital, for he might fail to believe this proposition if his hospitalization is for amnesia. Conversely, Jones could know that Jones is in the hospital by reading an account in a newspaper but fail to know that \\(he\\) is in the hospital, if he is mistaken about not only who he is but where he is. Thus, what Jones knows is supposed to be something other than the proposition that Jones is in the hospital and something that no one other than Jones can know. Accordingly, if omniscience requires knowing everything that anyone knows, God cannot be omniscient without being identical to Jones. Kretzmann took this to show the incompatibility of divine omniscience with \u201cthe doctrine of a personal God distinct from other persons\u201d (1966: 420). Put more carefully, the objection purports to show the incompatibility of divine omniscience with the existence of persons distinct from God who have self-knowledge. In the version advocated by Grim (1985), given that we do have first-person or de se knowledge, there is no omniscient God. Nagasawa (2003, see also 2008) gives an objection to Grim that appeals, in part, to the claim that omniscience is a \u201cepistemic power\u201d (which he takes to be included in divine omnipotence).\nGiven the structural similarity between the objection from present-time knowledge and the objection from first-person knowledge it is not surprising that philosophers have given parallel replies. (See Sosa 1983a,b on the analogy between first-person and present-time knowledge.) What is perhaps more surprising is that it has, for the most part, been opponents of the argument who have attempted to supply the details of exactly what the objects of knowledge and belief are in the case of knowledge of the present and of oneself. On the one hand, perhaps the propositions we know when we know what day it is are eternally true. In this case, what changes is our access to the propositions in question, rather than the propositions themselves. Kvanvig (1986) holds that such knowledge involves a special access to or a \u201cdirect grasp\u201d of a proposition, which leaves it open that God could believe the same propositions without thereby ending up with present-time knowledge or first-person knowledge of someone else. Wierenga (1989: 48\u201353) has proposed an account of the objects of present-time and first-person belief according to which these propositions involve haecceities or individual essences of persons and times. On this view, one gets a first-person belief by believing a proposition including his or her own haecceity, and one gets a present-time belief by believing a proposition involving the haecceity of a moment of time at the time in question. This leaves it open that God believes the same propositions we do. He does not get a first-person belief about someone else, because the relevant propositions do not include his own haecceity. And whether he gets a present-time belief depends on whether he believes these propositions involving the haecceities of moments of time at their times or at his eternal perspective. It is not knowing the propositions that makes him temporal; it is whether he believes in time or out of time. For criticism of this proposal, see Craig (2000) and Torre (2006). But for a recent positive presentation, see Swinburne (2016: 175\u2013182).\nA second kind of reply is available, one that does not appeal to a special kind of grasping or an exotic type of proposition. Rather, it takes its cue from recent work on indexicals, according to which some propositions are perspectival, that is, true at some perspectives or indices and false at others. On this view, the proposition, I am in the hospital, which Jones believed at t when he was then in the hospital is true at the index of \\(\\langle\\textrm{Jones}, t\\rangle\\) but false at many other indices, such as \\(\\langle\\textrm{Smith}, t\\rangle\\) or \\(\\langle\\textrm{Jones}, t + \\textrm{one month}\\rangle\\). Anyone can believe the eternal truth that this perspectival proposition is true at \\(\\langle\\)Jones, \\(t\\rangle\\), but only Jones is able to believe the perspectival proposition at \\(\\langle\\textrm{Jones}, t\\rangle\\). More generally, one can believe perspectival propositions only at the perspectives or indices one is at. Wierenga (2002: 155) suggests that if something like this is the correct account of first-person and present-time beliefs, then the definition of omniscience, (D1) above, should be replaced with\n\n(D4) S is omniscient \\(=_{\\textit{df}}\\) for every proposition p and perspective \\(\\langle x, t\\rangle\\), (i) if p is true at \\(\\langle x, t\\rangle\\) then S knows that p is true at \\(\\langle x, t\\rangle\\), and (ii) if S is at \\(\\langle x, t\\rangle\\) and p is true at \\(\\langle x, t\\rangle\\), then at \\(\\langle x, t\\rangle\\) S knows p.\n\nAccording to this definition, God can be omniscient without having the de se beliefs of others, and whether his knowledge changes over time depends, not on the mere fact of his omniscience, but on the further question of whether he has his beliefs at temporal indices.\n",
