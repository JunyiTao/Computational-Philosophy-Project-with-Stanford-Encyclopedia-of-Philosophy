    "main_text": "Historical Context\n1. Historical Context\n\nScientific pluralism, as an explicit program in philosophy of science,\nis of relatively recent origin. Motivated by cases for both historical\nand contemporary diversity of scientific methods and theories (Kuhn\n1962; Feyerabend 1965), post-war philosophers of science increasingly\nargued that plurality is not a problem but rather a productive feature\nof successful science. Contrasting this case for plurality with the\nideal of unified science, pluralism emerged as a core concept in the\nnegotiation of the post-positivist identity of philosophy of science.\nPluralist philosophers of science share a methodological commitment to\nstudying scientific practices in their diachronic and synchronic\ncomplexity rather than aiming for characterizations of the structure\nof science in singular and for unification as an idealized goal.\nSometimes formulated in polemic opposition to earlier positivist\nphases of philosophy of science, pluralism has become an umbrella\nconcept for philosophical engagement with conceptual, methodological,\ntheoretical, and social diversity in science.\n\nWhile frameworks of scientific pluralism were largely formulated in\nthe second half of the twentieth century, the linguistic fragmentation\nof post-war philosophy led to relatively isolated national discourses\nabout scientific pluralism. For example, scientific pluralism in West\nGermany emerged as a core topic in philosophy of science (Diemer 1971;\nLandgrebe [ed.] 1972; Str\u00f6ker 1971) in the wake of the positivism\ndispute of the 1960s (Adorno et al. 1972) and became widely embraced\nby critical rationalists in the tradition of Popper who positioned\npluralism as a crucial component of non-dogmatic fallibilism and of\nscience in an open society (Spinner 1968; Albert 1970). In contrast,\ncritical theorists challenged the pluralism of critical rationalists\nas propagating a free market of ideas that actually excludes\nemancipatory conceptions of science (von Bretano 1971) and falsely\nassumes neutrality while failing to reflect on its own normative\nassumptions (Habermas 1970 [1990]). In the United States, the\narticulation of scientific pluralism as an explicit program for\nphilosophy of science has often been related to Patrick Suppes\u2019\npresidential address \u201cThe Plurality of Science\u201d at the\n1977 Philosophy of Science Association (Suppes 1978; see also\nGalison & Stump [eds.] 1996; Kellert et al. [eds.] 2006a).\nSuppes\u2019 address indeed marks an important point in the\ndevelopment of pluralist philosophy of science, both because it\nsynthesized a growing discomfort with unificationist agendas in North\nAmerica and because it articulated a pluralist program that later grew\ninto the Stanford School of Philosophy which included the\nworks of Nancy Cartwright, John Dupr\u00e9, Peter Galison, and Ian\nHacking, among others.\n\nThe early phase of scientific pluralism in the United States differed\nfrom its European counterparts in being less engaged with the social\nand political organization of science and more focused on questions of\ntheory reduction and physicalism that were promoted both by\n\u00e9migr\u00e9 logical positivists and a new generation of\nAmerican philosophers like Nagel (1961), Suppes\u2019 doctoral\nadvisor. In the United States, scientific pluralism thereby became\nframed as a counter-program to unity of science (see Galison &\nStump [eds.] 1996) and Alan Richardson (2006: 3) has aptly described\npluralism as a continuing key topic\n\n\nbecause current philosophy of science is still working out the ways in\nwhich it is not logical empiricism anymore.\n\n\nPresenting scientific pluralism as a new philosophical paradigm in\ndirect opposition to the unity of science movement, however, runs the\nrisk of an oversimplified historical narrative both because of rich\ntraditions of pluralist thinking in the first half of the twentieth\ncentury and because of their multifarious connections with the unity\nof science movement.\n\nAmerican pragmatism constitutes a philosophical tradition with rich\npluralist resources, ranging from James\u2019 (1909) commitment to\npluralism as a metaphysical claim about the fundamental structure of\nreality to Dewey\u2019s pluralist case for the epistemic and social\nbenefits of disciplinary diversity and coordination. Dewey\u2019s\n\u201cUnity of Science as a Social Problem\u201d (1938 [1988]),\npublished in the International Encyclopedia of Unified\nScience, illustrates the complex relations between pragmatism,\nunity of science movement, and scientific pluralism (Reisch 2005).\nDewey emphasized that \u201cin the house which science might build\nthere are many mansions\u201d and understood unity of science as a\ncoordination challenge of a plurality of scientific fields \u201cin\ncommon attack upon practical social problems\u201d (1938/1955: 34\n[1988: 276]). While North American philosophers of science\nincreasingly embraced analytic philosophy in opposition to earlier\nphilosophical traditions (Schliesser 2013), the pragmatist roots of\nphilosophers like Nagel challenge a simple divide between monist and\npluralist phases of philosophy of science (Pincock 2017; Schliesser\n2020).\n\nOn the European side, Neo-Kantianism constitutes an influential\nintellectual tradition that developed pluralist interpretations of\nscientific and non-scientific knowledge through emphasis on human\nperspectivity rather than one absolute account of reality as it is in\nitself (Cassirer 1929 [2020]; Rickert 1896; see also Flach 1994). Kant\ncontinues to be an important point of reference for scientific\npluralists especially in Europe and Latin America in the sense that\n\u201cKant\u2019s rediscovery of the human vantage point\u201d is\nmobilized to argue for \u201cthe situated nature of our scientific\nknowledge\u201d (Massimi 2017: 165; see also Abel 1993; Lombardi\n& Ransanz 2011; Torretti 2016). Furthermore, Neo-Kantianism also\nconstitutes an important historical link between pluralist\nintellectual traditions and the Vienna Circle as reflected already in\nMoritz Schlick\u2019s General Theory of Knowledge according\nto which\n\n\nevery sensible and philosophically honest worldview must be\npluralistic. For the universe is variegated and manifold, a fabric\nwoven of many qualities no two of which are exactly alike. A formal\nmetaphysical monism, with its principle that all being is in truth\none, does not give an adequate account; it must be supplemented with\nsome sort of pluralistic principle. (Schlick 1918: 305 [1974:\n333])\n\n\nIn the early development of positivism, Auguste Comte (1830 [1998])\ndistinguished himself by rejecting the search for universal\nexplanations or methods in science and defended, in contrast with many\nlater positivists of the Vienna Circle, the existence of a variety of\nresearch methods specific to each fundamental scientific domain. Other\nmajor figures of the French tradition of historical epistemology, such\nas Gaston Bachelard (1949) and Georges Canguilhem (1965), also\ndefended a lack of methodological unity of the sciences, emphasizing\n\u201cregionalist\u201d modes of rationalism.\n\nAmerican pragmatism, Neo-Kantianism, and early positivism not only\nillustrate the diverse historical roots of scientific pluralism but\nalso its complex historical connections with logical positivism and\nthe unity of science movement. A simple contrast between positivist\nunity and post-positivist disunity has also been challenged in other\nareas of the history of philosophy of science. For example, Neurath\nhas become widely recognized (Cartwright et al. 1996) as a core\norganizer of the unity of science movement who embraced a pluralist\nmosaic view of science rather than a reductionist physicalism (e.g.,\nNeurath 1935). Furthermore, Carnap\u2019s (1950) pluralism of\nconceptual frameworks has seen a new wave of popularity debates about\nboth ontology and conceptual engineering (Blatti & Lapointe [eds.]\n2016; Dutilh Novaes 2020).\n\nRather than thinking of scientific pluralism as an entirely new\nparadigm that displaced the unity of science in a linear historical\ndevelopment, the historical context therefore suggests a more complex\nprocess of negotiating the identity of post-positivist philosophy of\nscience in metaphysical, epistemological, and social terms. First,\nmetaphysical negotiation is exemplified in the work of the\nStanford School such as Cartwright\u2019s (1999) account of\na \u201cdappled world\u201d and Dupr\u00e9\u2019s (1993) case for\nthe \u201cdisorder of things\u201d. This metaphysical case for\nplurality focused less on logical empiricism but rather challenged\npost-positivist reformulations of the unity of science thesis that\nheavily relied on assumptions about intertheoretic reduction\n(Oppenheim & Putnam 1958; E. Nagel 1961) and increasingly\ninterpreted physicalism as a metaphysical thesis about what\nfundamentally exists (Hellman & Thompson 1975; Smart 1978).\n\nSecond, scientific pluralism has been embraced as a framework for\nnegotiating the epistemology rather than the metaphysics of science\n(Kellert et al. [eds.] 2006a). Many epistemological debates reflect\nthe increased integration of philosophy with history and social\nstudies of science. Challenging a sharp divide between an abstract\n\u201ccontext of justification\u201d and a historically contingent\n\u201ccontext of discovery\u201d (Schickore & Steinle [eds.]\n2006), scientific pluralism can often be understood as an attempt to\nreconcile systematic philosophy of science with the historization of\nscientific knowledge production from Bachelard\u2019s (1934 [1986])\nand Fleck\u2019s (1935) historical epistemologies to Kuhn\u2019s\n(1962) historical challenges of a unified scientific method. The\ninstitutionalization of both \u201cintegrated history and philosophy\nof science\u201d (Arabatzis and Schickore [eds.] 2012) and\n\u201cphilosophy of science in practice\u201d (Ankeny et al. 2011)\nreflects how much of this integration of historically contingent\nplurality and systematic philosophical analysis has become\nmainstreamed in philosophy of science.\n\nThe relation between science and society constitutes a third area of\npluralist negotiation of the post-positivist identity of philosophy of\nscience. While early pluralist frameworks such as Suppes (1978)\nremained in a depolitized frame of epistemological and metaphysical\nissues that characterized analytic philosophy of science in post-war\nAmerica (Reisch 2005), scientific pluralism has become a fertile\nmeeting ground for debates about the interaction between epistemic and\nsocial diversity. Although European debates about scientific pluralism\nwere intimately connected to politics both by critical rationalists\n(Albert 1970) and critical theorists (von Bretano 1971), feminist\nphilosophy of science (Harding 1988; Longino 1987) played a crucial\nrole in establishing questions of social and political diversity as\ncore topics for pluralist philosophy of science in North America. More\nrecently, debates about scientific pluralism have become deeply\nintertwined with wider debates about \u201cscience and values\u201d\n(Douglas 2009) and \u201cscience and democracy\u201d (Kitcher 2011).\nThrough this expansion towards questions about the social and\npolitical organization of science, pluralist philosophy of science has\nbecome increasingly engaged with interdisciplinary science and\ntechnology studies (STS) as well as science governance (Jasanoff [ed.]\n2004; Gorman [ed.] 2010; Latour 1999 [2004]).\n\nScientific pluralism would be misunderstood as a new paradigm that\nreplaced the unity of science movement. Instead, pluralist challenges\nof unification have emerged in different contexts and led to a\n\u201cplurality of pluralisms\u201d (Wylie 2015) that reimagines\npost-positivist philosophy of science along different metaphysical,\nepistemological, and social dimensions. Generic commitments to\n\u201cplurality\u201d by philosophers of science are therefore not\nmuch more informative than generic commitments to\n\u201cdiversity\u201d by science administrators. The interesting\nquestion is not whether to endorse plurality or diversity in general\nterms but how to specify plurality and diversity in scientific\npractice. The following sections outline four areas in which pluralist\nphilosophy of science has made substantial contributions to rethinking\nscientific practice.\n",
