    "preamble": "\n\nBertrand Arthur William Russell (1872\u20131970) was a British\nphilosopher, logician, essayist and social critic best known for his\nwork in mathematical logic and analytic philosophy. His most\ninfluential contributions include his championing of logicism (the\nview that mathematics is in some important sense reducible to logic),\nhis refining of\n Gottlob Frege\u2019s\n predicate calculus (which still forms the basis of most contemporary\nsystems of logic), his defense of\n neutral monism\n (the view that the world consists of just one type of substance which\nis neither exclusively mental nor exclusively physical), and his\ntheories of\n definite descriptions,\n logical atomism and\n logical types.\n \n\nTogether with\n G.E. Moore,\n Russell is generally recognized as one of the founders of modern\nanalytic philosophy. His famous\n paradox,\n theory of types and work with\n A.N. Whitehead\n on\n Principia Mathematica\n invigorated the study of logic throughout the twentieth century\n(Schilpp 1944, xiii; Wilczek 2010, 74). In the public mind, he was \nfamous as much for his evangelical atheism as for his contributions to\ntechnical philosophy.\n\nOver the course of a long career, Russell also made important\ncontributions to a broad range of other subjects, including\n ethics,\n politics, educational theory and religious\nstudies, cheerfully ignoring Hooke\u2019s admonition to the Royal\nSociety against \u201cmeddling with Divinity, Metaphysics, Moralls,\nPoliticks, Grammar, Rhetorick, or Logick\u201d (Kreisel 1973, 24). Generations of general readers have also benefited from his \npopular writings on a wide variety of topics in both the humanities\nand the natural sciences. Like\n Voltaire,\n to whom he has been compared (Times of London 1970, 12), he wrote\nwith style and wit and had enormous influence.\n\nAfter a life marked by controversy \u2013 including dismissals from\nboth Trinity College, Cambridge, and City College, New York \u2013\nRussell was awarded the Order of Merit in 1949 and the Nobel Prize for\nLiterature in 1950. Noted also for his many spirited anti-nuclear\nprotests and for his campaign against western involvement in the\nVietnam War, Russell remained a prominent public figure until his\ndeath at the age of 97.\n\nInterested readers may listen to\n two sound clips of Russell speaking. \n",

Russell\u2019s Chronology\n\nA short chronology of the major events in Russell\u2019s life is as\nfollows: \n\n(1872) Born May 18 at Ravenscroft in Trelleck, Monmouthshire,\nUK.\n(1874) Death of mother and sister.\n(1876) Death of father; Russell\u2019s grandfather, Lord John\nRussell (the former Prime Minister), and grandmother succeed in\noverturning Russell\u2019s father\u2019s will to win custody of\nRussell and his brother, rather than have them raised as\nfree-thinkers.\n(1878) Death of grandfather; Russell\u2019s grandmother, Lady\nRussell, supervises Russell\u2019s upbringing at Pembroke Lodge,\nLondon.\n(1883) Receives his first lessons in geometry from his brother\nFrank.\n(1890) Enters Trinity College, Cambridge; meets\n Whitehead.\n(1893) Awarded first-class BA in Mathematics.\n(1894) Completes the Moral Sciences Tripos (Part II); appointed\nHonorary British Attach\u00e9 in Paris; marries Alys Pearsall\nSmith.\n(1895) Studies at the University of Berlin.\n(1896) Appointed lecturer at the London School of Economics;\nlectures in the US at Johns Hopkins and Bryn Mawr.\n(1899) Appointed lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge.\n(1900) Meets Peano at the First International Congress of\nPhilosophy in Paris.\n(1901) Reappointed lecturer at Cambridge; discovers\n Russell\u2019s paradox.\n(1902) Corresponds with\n Frege.\n(1905) Develops his theory of\n descriptions.\n(1907) Runs for parliament and is defeated.\n(1908) Elected Fellow of the Royal Society.\n(1910) Fails to receive Liberal Party nomination for parliament\nbecause of his atheism; reappointed lecturer at Trinity College,\nCambridge.\n(1911) Meets\n Wittgenstein;\n elected President of the Aristotelian Society; separates from\nAlys.\n(1913) Lectures at the \u00c9cole des Hautes Sociales in\nParis.\n(1914) Visits Harvard and teaches courses in logic and the theory\nof knowledge; meets T.S.

One of the\nmore famous comes from the Oxford philosopher\n A.J. Ayer.\n As Ayer writes, \u201cThe popular conception of a philosopher as one\nwho combines universal learning with the direction of human conduct\nwas more nearly satisfied by Bertrand Russell than by any other\nphilosopher of our time\u201d (1972a, 127). Another telling comment\ncomes from the Harvard philosopher\n W.V. Quine:\n \u201cI think many of us were drawn to our profession by\nRussell\u2019s books. He wrote a spectrum of books for a graduated\npublic, layman to specialist. We were beguiled by the wit and a sense\nof new-found clarity with respect to central traits of reality\u201d\n(1966c, 657). \n\nDespite such comments, perhaps the most memorable encapsulation of\nRussell\u2019s life and work comes from Russell himself. As Russell\ntells us, \n\n\nThree passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my\nlife: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable\npity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds,\nhave blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great\nocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.\n\nI have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy \u2013 ecstasy\nso great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a\nfew hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves\nloneliness \u2013 that terrible loneliness in which one shivering\nconsciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold\nunfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it finally, because in the\nunion of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring\nvision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what\nI sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is\nwhat \u2013 at last \u2013 I have found.\n\nWith equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to\nunderstand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars\nshine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which\nnumber holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I\nhave achieved. \n\nLove and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward\nthe heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries\nof pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured\nby oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and\nthe whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of\nwhat human life should be. I long to alleviate this evil, but I\ncannot, and I too suffer.\n\nThis has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly\nlive it again if the chance were offered me. (1967, 3\u20134)\n\n\nBy any standard, Russell led an enormously full life. In addition to\nhis ground-breaking intellectual work in logic and analytic\nphilosophy, he involved himself for much of his life in politics. As\nearly as 1904 he spoke out frequently in favour of internationalism\nand in 1907 he ran unsuccessfully for Parliament. Although he stood as\nan independent, he endorsed the full 1907 Liberal platform. He also\nadvocated extending the franchise to women, provided that such a\nradical political change could be introduced through constitutionally\nrecognized means (Wood 1957, 71). Three years later he published his\nAnti-Suffragist Anxieties (1910).\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I, Russell became involved in anti-war\nactivities and in 1916 he was fined 100 pounds for authoring an\nanti-war pamphlet. Because of his conviction, he was dismissed from\nhis post at Trinity College, Cambridge (Hardy 1942). Two years later,\nhe was convicted a second time, this time for suggesting that American\ntroops might be used to intimidate strikers in Britain (Clark 1975,\n337\u2013339). The result was five months in Brixton Prison as\nprisoner No. 2917. In 1922 and 1923 Russell ran twice more for\nParliament, again unsuccessfully, and together with his second wife,\nDora, he founded an experimental school that they operated during the\nlate 1920s and early 1930s (Russell 1926 and Park 1963). Perhaps not\nsurprisingly, some of Russell\u2019s more radical activities \u2013\nincluding his advocacy of post-Victorian sexual practices \u2013 were\nlinked in many people\u2019s minds to his atheism, made famous in\npart by his 1948 BBC debate with the Jesuit philosopher Frederick\nCopleston over the existence of God. \n\nAlthough Russell became the third Earl Russell upon the death of his\nbrother in 1931, Russell\u2019s radicalism continued to make him a\ncontroversial figure well through middle-age. While teaching at UCLA\nin the United States in the late 1930s, he was offered a teaching\nappointment at City College, New York. The appointment was revoked\nfollowing a series of protests and a 1940 judicial decision which\nfound him morally unfit to teach at the College (Dewey and Kallen\n1941, Irvine 1996, Weidlich 2000). The legal decision had been based\npartly on Russell\u2019s atheism and partly on his fame as an\nadvocate of free love and open marriages.\n\nIn 1954, Russell delivered his famous \u201cMan\u2019s Peril\u201d\nbroadcast on the BBC, condemning the Bikini H-bomb tests. A year\nlater, together with Albert Einstein, he released the Russell-Einstein\nManifesto calling for the curtailment of nuclear weapons. In 1957, he\nbecame a prime organizer of the first Pugwash Conference, which\nbrought together a large number of scientists concerned about the\nnuclear issue. He became founding president of the Campaign for\nNuclear Disarmament in 1958 and Honorary President of the Committee of\n100 in 1960. \n\nIn 1961, Russell was once again imprisoned, this time for a week in\nconnection with anti-nuclear protests. The media coverage surrounding\nhis conviction only served to enhance Russell\u2019s reputation and\nto further inspire the many idealistic youth who were sympathetic to\nhis anti-war and anti-nuclear message. Beginning in 1963, he began\nwork on a variety of additional issues, including lobbying on behalf\nof political prisoners under the auspices of the Bertrand Russell\nPeace Foundation.\n\nThroughout much of his life, Russell saw himself primarily as a writer\nrather than as a philosopher, listing \u201cAuthor\u201d as his\nprofession on his passport. As he says in his Autobiography,\n\u201cI resolved not to adopt a profession, but to devote myself to\nwriting\u201d (1967, 125). Upon being awarded the Nobel Prize for\nLiterature in 1950, Russell used his acceptance speech once again to emphasize \nthemes relating to his social activism. \n\nOver the years, Russell has served as the subject of numerous creative\nworks, including T.S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cMr Apollinax\u201d (1917),\nD.H. Lawrence\u2019s \u201cThe Blind Man\u201d (1920), Aldous\nHuxley\u2019s Chrome Yellow (1921), Bruce Duffy\u2019s\nThe World as I Found It (1987) and the graphic novel by\nApostolos Doxiadis and Christos Papadimitriou, Logicomix: An Epic\nSearch for Truth (2009).\n\nReaders wanting additional information about Russell\u2019s life are\nencouraged to consult Russell\u2019s five autobiographical volumes:\nPortraits from Memory and other Essays (A1956b), My\nPhilosophical Development (1959) and The Autobiography of\nBertrand Russell (3 volumes, 1967, 1968, 1969). In addition, John\nSlater\u2019s accessible Bertrand Russell (1994) gives a\nshort but informative introduction to Russell\u2019s life, work and\ninfluence. Other sources of biographical information include Ronald\nClark\u2019s authoritative The Life of Bertrand Russell\n(1975), Ray Monk\u2019s two volumes, Bertrand Russell: The Spirit\nof Solitude (1996) and Bertrand Russell: The Ghost of\nMadness (2000), and the first volume of Andrew Irvine\u2019s\nBertrand Russell: Critical Assessments (1999).\n\nFor a chronology of Russell\u2019s major publications, readers are\nencouraged to consult the\n Primary Literature\n section of the Bibliography below.

Russell\u2019s Work in Logic\n\nRussell\u2019s main contributions to logic and the foundations of\nmathematics include his discovery of\n Russell\u2019s paradox,\n also known as the Russell-Zermelo paradox (Linsky 2013), his development (together with Whitehead) of the\n theory of types,\n his championing of logicism (the view that mathematics is, in some\nsignificant sense, reducible to formal logic), his impressively\ngeneral theory of logical relations, his formalization of the\nmathematics of quantity and of the real numbers, and his refining of\nthe first-order predicate calculus. \n\nRussell discovered the paradox that bears his name in 1901, while\nworking on his Principles of Mathematics (1903). The paradox\narises in connection with the set of all sets that are not members of\nthemselves. Such a set, if it exists, will be a member of itself if\nand only if it is not a member of itself. In his 1901 draft of the\nPrinciples of Mathematics, Russell summarizes the problem as\nfollows:\n\nThe axiom that all referents with respect to a given relation form a\nclass seems, however, to require some limitation, and that for the\nfollowing reason. We saw that some predicates can be predicated of\nthemselves. Consider now those \u2026 of which this is not the case.\n\u2026 [T]here is no predicate which attaches to all of them and to\nno other terms. For this predicate will either be predicable or not\npredicable of itself. If it is predicable of itself, it is one of\nthose referents by relation to which it was defined, and therefore, in\nvirtue of their definition, it is not predicable of itself.\nConversely, if it is not predicable of itself, then again it is one of\nthe said referents, of all of which (by hypothesis) it is predicable,\nand therefore again it is predicable of itself. This is a\ncontradiction. (CP, Vol. 3, 195)\n\n\nThe paradox is significant since, using classical logic, all sentences\nare entailed by a contradiction. Russell\u2019s discovery thus\nprompted a large amount of work in logic, set theory, and the\n philosophy and foundations of mathematics.\n\nRussell\u2019s response to the\n paradox\n came between 1903 and 1908 with the development of his\n theory of types.\n It was clear to Russell that some form of restriction needed to be\nplaced on the original comprehension (or abstraction) axiom of\nna\u00efve set theory, the axiom that formalizes the intuition that\nany coherent condition (or property) may be used to determine a set.\nRussell\u2019s basic idea was that reference to sets such as the\nso-called Russell set (the set of all sets that are not members of\nthemselves) could be avoided by arranging all sentences into a\nhierarchy, beginning with sentences about individuals at the lowest\nlevel, sentences about sets of individuals at the next lowest level,\nsentences about sets of sets of individuals at the next lowest level,\nand so on. Using a vicious circle principle similar to that adopted by\nthe mathematician Henri Poincar\u00e9, together with his so-called\n\u201cno class\u201d theory of classes (in which class terms gain\nmeaning only when placed in the appropriate context), Russell was able\nto explain why the unrestricted comprehension axiom fails:\n propositional functions,\n such as the function \u201cx is a set,\u201d may not be\napplied to themselves since self-application would involve a vicious\ncircle. As a result, all objects for which a given condition (or\npredicate) holds must be at the same level or of the same\n\u201ctype.\u201d Sentences about these objects will then always be\nhigher in the hierarchy than the objects themselves.\n\nAlthough first introduced in 1903, the theory of types was further\ndeveloped by Russell in his 1908 article \u201cMathematical Logic as\nBased on the Theory of Types\u201d and in the three-volume work he\nco-authored with\n Alfred North Whitehead,\n Principia Mathematica (1910, 1912, 1913). The theory thus admits of two\nversions, the \u201csimple theory\u201d of 1903 and the\n\u201cramified theory\u201d of 1908. Both versions of the theory\ncame under attack: the simple theory for being too weak, the ramified\ntheory for being too strong. For some, it was important that any\nproposed solution be comprehensive enough to resolve all known\nparadoxes at once. For others, it was important that any proposed\nsolution not disallow those parts of classical mathematics that\nremained consistent, even though they appeared to violate the vicious\ncircle principle. (For discussion of related paradoxes, see Chapter 2\nof the Introduction to Whitehead and Russell (1910), as well as the\nentry on\n paradoxes and contemporary logic\n in this encyclopedia.)\n\nRussell himself had recognized several of these same concerns as early\nas 1903, noting that it was unlikely that any single solution would\nresolve all the known paradoxes. Together with Whitehead, he was also\nable to introduce a new axiom, the axiom of reducibility, which\nlessened the vicious circle principle\u2019s scope of application and\nso resolved many of the most worrisome aspects of type theory. Even\nso, critics claimed that the axiom was simply too ad hoc to be\njustified philosophically. (For additional discussion see Linsky\n(1990), Linsky (2002) and Wahl (2011).)\n\nOf equal significance during this period was Russell\u2019s defense\nof logicism, the theory that mathematics is in some important sense\nreducible to logic. First defended in his 1901 article \u201cRecent\nWork on the Principles of Mathematics,\u201d and later in greater\ndetail in his Principles of Mathematics and in Principia\nMathematica, Russell\u2019s logicism consisted of two main\ntheses. The first was that all mathematical truths can be translated\ninto logical truths or, in other words, that the vocabulary of\nmathematics constitutes a proper subset of the vocabulary of logic.\nThe second was that all mathematical proofs can be recast as logical\nproofs or, in other words, that the theorems of mathematics constitute\na proper subset of the theorems of logic. As Russell summarizes,\n\u201cThe fact that all Mathematics is Symbolic Logic is one of the\ngreatest discoveries of our age; and when this fact has been\nestablished, the remainder of the principles of mathematics consists\nin the analysis of Symbolic Logic itself\u201d (1903, 5).\n\nLike\n Gottlob Frege,\n Russell\u2019s basic idea for defending logicism was that numbers\nmay be identified with classes of classes and that number-theoretic\nstatements may be explained in terms of quantifiers and identity. Thus\nthe number 1 is to be identified with the class of all unit classes,\nthe number 2 with the class of all two-membered classes, and so on.\nStatements such as \u201cThere are at least two books\u201d would be\nrecast as statements such as \u201cThere is a book, x, and\nthere is a book, y, and x is not identical to\ny.\u201d Statements such as \u201cThere are exactly two\nbooks\u201d would be recast as \u201cThere is a book, x,\nand there is a book, y, and x is not identical to\ny, and if there is a book, z, then z is\nidentical to either x or y.\u201d It follows that\nnumber-theoretic operations may then be explained in terms of\nset-theoretic operations such as intersection, union, and difference.\nIn Principia Mathematica, Whitehead and Russell were able to\nprovide many detailed derivations of major theorems in set theory,\nfinite and transfinite arithmetic, and elementary measure theory. They\nwere also able to develop a sophisticated theory of logical relations\nand a unique method of founding the real numbers. Even so, the issue\nof whether set theory itself can be said to have been successfully\nreduced to logic remained controversial. A fourth volume on geometry\nwas planned but never completed.\n\nRussell\u2019s most important writings relating to these topics\ninclude not only his Principles of Mathematics (1903),\n\u201cMathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types\u201d\n(1908), and Principia Mathematica (1910, 1912, 1913), but\nalso his earlier Essay on the Foundations of Geometry (1897)\nand his Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy (1919a), the\nlast of which was written while Russell was serving time in Brixton\nPrison as a result of his anti-war activities. Coincidentally, it was\nat roughly this same time that\n Ludwig Wittgenstein,\n Russell\u2019s most famous pupil, was completing his Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus (1921) while being detained as a prisoner of\nwar at Monte Cassino in Italy during World War I. \n\nAnyone needing assistance in deciphering the symbolism found in the\nmore technical of Russell\u2019s writings is encouraged to consult\nthe\n Notation in Principia Mathematica\n entry in this encyclopedia.\n3. Russell\u2019s Work in Analytic Philosophy\n\nIn much the same way that Russell used logic in an attempt to clarify\nissues in the foundations of mathematics, he also used logic in an\nattempt to clarify issues in philosophy. As one of the founders of\nanalytic philosophy, Russell made significant contributions to a wide\nvariety of areas, including\n metaphysics,\n epistemology,\n ethics\n and political theory. His advances in logic and metaphysics also had\nsignificant influence on Rudolf Carnap and the\n Vienna Circle.\n \n\nAccording to Russell, it is the philosopher\u2019s job to discover a\nlogically ideal language \u2013 a language capable of describing the\nworld in such a way that we will not be misled by the accidental,\nimprecise surface structure of natural language. As Russell writes,\n\u201cOrdinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what\nphysics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not\nsufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say\nas little as the physicist means to say\u201d (1931, 82). Just as\natomic facts (the association of properties and relations with\nindividuals) combine to form molecular facts in the world itself, such\na language will allow for the description of such combinations using\nlogical connectives such as \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor.\u201d In\naddition to the existence of atomic and molecular facts, Russell also\nheld that general facts (facts about \u201call\u201d of something)\nare needed to complete our picture of the world. Famously, he\nvacillated on whether negative facts are also required (1918, 1919).\n\n\nThe reason Russell believes many ordinarily accepted statements are\nopen to doubt is that they appear to refer to entities that may be\nknown only through inference. Thus, underlying Russell\u2019s various\nprojects was not only his use of logical analysis, but also his\nlong-standing aim of discovering whether, and to what extent,\nknowledge is possible. \u201cThere is one great question,\u201d he\nwrites in 1911. \u201cCan human beings know anything, and if\nso, what and how? This question is really the most essentially\nphilosophical of all questions\u201d (quoted in Slater 1994, 67).\n\nMotivating this question was the traditional problem of the external\nworld. If our knowledge of the external world comes through inferences\nto the best explanation, and if such inferences are always fallible,\nwhat guarantee do we have that our beliefs are true?\nRussell\u2019s response to this question was partly metaphysical and\npartly epistemological. On the metaphysical side, Russell developed\nhis famous theory of\n logical atomism,\n in which the world is said to consist of a complex of logical atoms\n(such as \u201clittle patches of colour\u201d) and their properties\nand relations. (The theory was crucial for influencing\n Wittgenstein\u2019s theory\n of the same name.) Together these atoms and their properties form the\nfacts which, in turn, combine to form logically complex objects. What\nwe normally take to be inferred entities (for example, enduring\nphysical objects) are then understood as\n logical constructions\n formed from the immediately given entities of sensation, viz.,\n\u201csensibilia.\u201d\n\nOn the epistemological side, Russell argues that it is also important\nto show how each questionable entity may be reduced to, or defined in\nterms of, another entity (or entities) whose existence is more\ncertain. For example, on this view, an ordinary physical object that\nnormally might be thought to be known only through inference may be\ndefined instead \n\nas a certain series of appearances, connected with each other by\ncontinuity and by certain causal laws. \u2026 More generally, a\n\u2018thing\u2019 will be defined as a certain series of aspects,\nnamely those which would commonly be said to be of the thing.\nTo say that a certain aspect is an aspect of a certain thing\nwill merely mean that it is one of those which, taken serially,\nare the thing. (1914a, 106\u2013107)\n\n\nThe reason we are able to do this, says Russell, is that \n\nour world is not wholly a matter of inference. There are things that\nwe know without asking the opinion of men of science. If you are too\nhot or too cold, you can be perfectly aware of this fact without\nasking the physicist what heat and cold consist of. \u2026 We may\ngive the name \u2018data\u2019 to all the things of which we are\naware without inference. (1959, 23)\n\n\nWe can then use these data (or \u201csensibilia\u201d or\n \u201csense data\u201d)\n with which we are directly acquainted to construct the relevant\nobjects of knowledge. Similarly, numbers may be reduced to collections\nof classes; points and instants may be reduced to ordered classes of\nvolumes and events; and classes themselves may be reduced to\npropositional functions. \n\nIt is with these kinds of examples in mind that Russell suggests we\nadopt what he calls \u201cthe supreme maxim in scientific\nphilosophizing,\u201d namely the principle that \u201cWhenever\npossible, logical constructions,\u201d or as he also sometimes puts\nit, \u201clogical fictions,\u201d are \u201cto be substituted for\ninferred entities\u201d (1914c, 155; cf. 1914a, 107, and 1924, 326).\nAnything that resists construction in this sense may be said to be an\nontological atom. Such objects are atomic, both in the sense that they\nfail to be composed of individual, substantial parts, and in the sense\nthat they exist independently of one another. Their corresponding\npropositions are also atomic, both in the sense that they contain no\nother propositions as parts, and in the sense that the members of any\npair of true atomic propositions will be logically independent of one\nanother. Russell believes that formal logic, if carefully developed,\nwill mirror precisely, not only the various relations between all such\npropositions, but their various internal structures as well. \n\nIt is in this context that Russell also introduces his famous\ndistinction between two kinds of knowledge of truths: that which is\ndirect, intuitive, certain and infallible, and that which is indirect,\nderivative, uncertain and open to error (1905, 41f; 1911, 1912, and\n1914b). To be justified, every indirect knowledge claim must be\ncapable of being derived from more fundamental, direct or intuitive\nknowledge claims. The kinds of truths that are capable of being known\ndirectly include truths about immediate facts of sensation and truths\nof logic. Examples are discussed in The Problems of\nPhilosophy (1912a) where Russell states that propositions with\nthe highest degree of self-evidence (what he here calls\n\u201cintuitive knowledge\u201d) include \u201cthose which merely\nstate what is given in sense, and also certain abstract logical and\narithmetical principles, and (though with less certainty) some ethical\npropositions\u201d (1912a, 109).\n\nEventually, Russell supplemented this distinction between direct and\nindirect knowledge of truths with his equally famous distinction\nbetween knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. As\nRussell explains, \u201cI say that I am acquainted with an object\nwhen I have a direct cognitive relation to that object, i.e. when I am\ndirectly aware of the object itself. When I speak of a cognitive\nrelation here, I do not mean the sort of relation which constitutes\njudgment, but the sort which constitutes presentation\u201d (1911,\n209). Later, he clarifies this point by adding that acquaintance\ninvolves, not knowledge of truths, but knowledge of things (1912a,\n44). Thus, while intuitive knowledge and derivative knowledge both\ninvolve knowledge of propositions (or truths), knowledge by\nacquaintance and knowledge by description both involve knowledge of\nthings (or objects). This distinction is slightly complicated by the\nfact that, even though knowledge by description is in part based upon\nknowledge of truths, it is still knowledge of things, and not of\ntruths. (I am grateful to Russell Wahl for reminding me of this\npoint.) Since it is things with which we have direct acquaintance that\nare the least questionable members of our ontology, it is these\nobjects upon which Russell ultimately bases his epistemology.\n\nAlso relevant was Russell\u2019s reliance upon his so-called\nregressive method (Irvine 1989, Mayo-Wilson 2011) and his eventual\nabandoning of foundationalism in favour of a more recognizably\ncoherentist approach to knowledge (Irvine 2004). As Russell puts it,\neven in logic and mathematics\n\nWe tend to believe the premises because we can see that their\nconsequences are true, instead of believing the consequences because\nwe know the premises to be true. But the inferring of premises from\nconsequences is the essence of induction; thus the method in\ninvestigating the principles of mathematics is really an inductive\nmethod, and is substantially the same as the method of discovering\ngeneral laws in any other science. (1907, 273\u2013274)\n\n\nRussell\u2019s contributions to metaphysics and epistemology are also\nunified by his views concerning the centrality of scientific\nknowledge and the importance of there being an underlying methodology\ncommon to philosophy and science. In the case of philosophy, this\nmethodology expresses itself through Russell\u2019s use of logical\nanalysis (Hager 1994, Irvine 2004). In fact, Russell often claims that\nhe has more confidence in his methodology than in any particular\nphilosophical conclusion.\n\nThis broad conception of philosophy arose in part from Russell\u2019s\nidealist origins (Hylton 1990a, Griffin 1991). This is so, even though\nRussell tells us that his one, true revolution in philosophy came as a\nresult of his break from idealism. Russell saw that the idealist\ndoctrine of internal relations led to a series of contradictions\nregarding asymmetrical (and other) relations necessary for\nmathematics. As he reports, \n\nIt was towards the end of 1898 that Moore and I rebelled against both\nKant and Hegel. Moore led the way, but I followed closely in his\nfootsteps. \u2026 [Our rebellion centred upon] the doctrine that\nfact is in general independent of experience. Although we were in\nagreement, I think that we differed as to what most interested us in\nour new philosophy. I think that Moore was most concerned with the\nrejection of idealism, while I was most interested in the rejection of\nmonism. (1959, 54)\n\n\nThe two ideas were closely connected through the so-called doctrine of\ninternal relations. In contrast to this doctrine, Russell proposed his\nown new doctrine of external relations: \n\nThe doctrine of internal relations held that every relation between\ntwo terms expresses, primarily, intrinsic properties of the two terms\nand, in ultimate analysis, a property of the whole which the two\ncompose. With some relations this view is plausible. Take, for\nexample, love or hate. If A loves B, this relation exemplifies itself\nand may be said to consist in certain states of mind of A. Even an\natheist must admit that a man can love God. It follows that love of\nGod is a state of the man who feels it, and not properly a relational\nfact. But the relations that interested me were of a more abstract\nsort. Suppose that A and B are events, and A is earlier than B. I do\nnot think that this implies anything in A in virtue of which,\nindependently of B, it must have a character which we inaccurately\nexpress by mentioning B. Leibniz gives an extreme example. He says\nthat, if a man living in Europe has a wife in India and the wife dies\nwithout his knowing it, the man undergoes an intrinsic change at the\nmoment of her death. (1959, 54)\n\n\nThis is the type of doctrine Russell opposed, especially with respect\nto the asymmetrical relations necessary for mathematics. For example,\nconsider two numbers, one of which is found earlier than the other in\na given series: \n\nIf A is earlier than B, then B is not earlier than A. If you try to\nexpress the relation of A to B by means of adjectives of A and B, you\nwill have to make the attempt by means of dates. You may say that the\ndate of A is a property of A and the date of B is a property of B, but\nthat will not help you because you will have to go on to say that the\ndate of A is earlier than the date of B, so that you will have found\nno escape from the relation. If you adopt the plan of regarding the\nrelation as a property of the whole composed of A and B, you are in a\nstill worse predicament, for in that whole A and B have no order and\ntherefore you cannot distinguish between \u201cA is earlier than\nB\u201d and \u201cB is earlier than A.\u201d As asymmetrical\nrelations are essential in most parts of mathematics, this doctrine\nwas important. (1959, 54\u201355)\n\n\nThus, by the end of 1898 Russell had abandoned the idealism that he\nhad been encouraged to adopt as a student at Cambridge, along with his\noriginal Kantian methodology. In its place he adopted a new,\npluralistic\n realism.\n As a result, he soon became famous as an advocate of \u201cthe new\nrealism\u201d and of his \u201cnew philosophy of logic,\u201d\nemphasizing as he did the importance of modern logic for philosophical\nanalysis. The underlying themes of this revolution included\nRussell\u2019s belief in pluralism, his emphasis on anti-psychologism\nand his belief in the importance of science. Each of these themes\nremained central to his philosophy for the remainder of his life\n(Hager 1994, Weitz 1944).\n\nRussell\u2019s most important writings relating to these topics\ninclude Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by\nDescription (1911), The Problems of Philosophy (1912a),\n\u201cOur Knowledge of the External World\u201d (1914a), On the\nNature of Acquaintance (1914b, published more completely in\nCollected Papers, Vol. 7), \u201cThe Philosophy of Logical\nAtomism\u201d (1918, 1919), \u201cLogical Atomism\u201d (1924),\nThe Analysis of Mind (1921), The Analysis of Matter\n(1927a), Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits (1948), and\nTheory of Knowledge (CP, Vol. 7).\n4. Russell\u2019s Theory of Definite Descriptions\n\nRussell\u2019s philosophical method has at its core the making and\ntesting of hypotheses through the weighing of evidence. Hence\nRussell\u2019s comment that he wished to emphasize the\n\u201cscientific method\u201d in philosophy. His method also\nrequires the rigorous analysis of problematic propositions using the\nmachinery of first-order logic. It was Russell\u2019s belief that by\nusing the new logic of his day, philosophers would be able to exhibit\nthe underlying \u201clogical form\u201d of natural-language\nstatements. A statement\u2019s logical form, in turn, would help\nresolve various problems of reference associated with the ambiguity\nand vagueness of natural language. \n\nSince the introduction of the modern predicate calculus, it has been\ncommon to use three separate logical notations\n(\u201cPx\u201d, \u201cx = y\u201d, and\n\u201c\u2203x\u201d) to represent three separate senses of\nthe natural-language word \u201cis\u201d: the is of\npredication, e.g. \u201cCicero is wise\u201d; the is of\nidentity, e.g. \u201cCicero is Tully\u201d; and the is of\nexistence, e.g. \u201cCicero is\u201d. It was Russell\u2019s\nsuggestion that, just as we use logic to make clear these\ndistinctions, we can also use logic to discover other ontologically\nsignificant distinctions, distinctions that should be reflected in the\nanalysis we give of each sentence\u2019s correct logical form. \n\nOn Russell\u2019s view, the subject matter of philosophy is then\ndistinguished from that of the sciences only by the generality and\na prioricity of philosophical statements, not by the\nunderlying methodology of the discipline. In philosophy, just as in\nmathematics, Russell believed that it was by applying logical\nmachinery and insights that advances in analysis would be made.\n\nRussell\u2019s most famous example of his new \u201canalytic\nmethod\u201d concerns so-called denoting phrases, phrases that\ninclude both\n definite descriptions\n and proper names. Like\n Alexius Meinong,\n Russell had initially adopted the view that every denoting phrase\n(for example, \u201cScott,\u201d \u201cthe author of\nWaverley,\u201d \u201cthe number two,\u201d \u201cthe\ngolden mountain\u201d) denoted, or referred to, an existing entity.\nOn this view, even fictional and imaginary entities had to be real in\norder to serve as truth-makers for true sentences such as\n\u201cUnicorns have exactly one horn.\u201d By the time his landmark\narticle, \u201cOn Denoting,\u201d appeared in 1905, Russell had\nmodified his extreme realism, substituting in its place the view that\ndenoting phrases need not possess a theoretical unity. As Russell puts\nit, the assumption that every denoting phrase must refer to an\nexisting entity was the type of assumption that exhibited \u201ca\nfailure of that feeling for reality which ought to be preserved even\nin the most abstract studies\u201d (1919a, 165).\n\nWhile logically proper names (words such as \u201cthis\u201d or\n\u201cthat\u201d which refer to sensations of which an agent is\nimmediately aware) do have referents associated with them, descriptive\nphrases (such as \u201cthe smallest number less than pi\u201d)\nshould be viewed merely as collections of quantifiers (such as\n\u201call\u201d and \u201csome\u201d) and\n propositional functions\n (such as \u201cx is a number\u201d). As such, they are not\nto be viewed as referring terms but, rather, as \u201cincomplete\nsymbols.\u201d In other words, they are to be viewed as symbols that\ntake on meaning within appropriate contexts, but that remain\nmeaningless in isolation.\n\nPut another way, it was Russell\u2019s insight that some phrases may\ncontribute to the meaning (or reference) of a sentence without\nthemselves being meaningful. As he explains, \n\nIf \u201cthe author of Waverley\u201d meant anything other\nthan \u201cScott\u201d, \u201cScott is the author of\nWaverley\u201d would be false, which it is not. If\n\u201cthe author of Waverley\u201d meant\n\u201cScott\u201d, \u201cScott is the author of\nWaverley\u201d would be a tautology, which it is not.\nTherefore, \u201cthe author of Waverley\u201d means neither\n\u201cScott\u201d nor anything else \u2013 i.e. \u201cthe author\nof Waverley\u201d means nothing, Q.E.D. (1959, 85)\n\n\nIf Russell is correct, it follows that in a sentence such as\n\n(1) The present King of France is bald,\n\n\nthe definite description \u201cThe present King of France\u201d\nplays a role quite different from the role a proper name such as\n\u201cScott\u201d plays in the sentence \n\n(2) Scott is bald.\n\n\nLetting K abbreviate the predicate \u201cis a present King\nof France\u201d and B abbreviate the predicate \u201cis\nbald,\u201d Russell assigns sentence (1) the logical form \n\n(1\u2032) There is an x such that\n\n\nKx,\nfor any y, if Ky then y=x, and \nBx.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, in the notation of the predicate calculus, we write\n\n\n(1\u2033) \u2203x[(Kx &\n\u2200y(Ky \u2192 y=x)) &\nBx].\n\n\nIn contrast, by allowing s to abbreviate the name\n\u201cScott,\u201d Russell assigns sentence (2) the very different\nlogical form \n\n(2\u2032) Bs.\n\n\nThis distinction between logical forms allows Russell to explain three\nimportant puzzles. \n\nThe first concerns the operation of the Law of Excluded Middle and how\nthis law relates to denoting terms. According to one reading of the\nLaw of Excluded Middle, it must be the case that either \u201cThe\npresent King of France is bald\u201d is true or \u201cThe present\nKing of France is not bald\u201d is true. But if so, both sentences\nappear to entail the existence of a present King of France, clearly an\nundesirable result, given that France is a republic and so has no\nking. Russell\u2019s analysis shows how this conclusion can be\navoided. By appealing to analysis (1\u2032\u2032), it follows that\nthere is a way to deny (1) without being committed to the existence of\na present King of France, namely by changing the scope of the negation\noperator and thereby accepting that \u201cIt is not the case that\nthere exists a present King of France who is bald\u201d is true.\n\nThe second puzzle concerns the Law of Identity as it operates in\n(so-called) opaque contexts. Even though \u201cScott is the author of\nWaverley\u201d is true, it does not follow that the two\nreferring terms \u201cScott\u201d and \u201cthe author of\nWaverley\u201d need be interchangeable in every situation.\nThus, although \u201cGeorge IV wanted to know whether Scott was the\nauthor of Waverley\u201d is true, \u201cGeorge IV wanted to\nknow whether Scott was Scott\u201d is, presumably, false. \n\nRussell\u2019s distinction between the logical forms associated with\nthe use of proper names and definite descriptions again shows why this\nis so. To see this, we once again let s abbreviate the name\n\u201cScott.\u201d We also let w abbreviate\n\u201cWaverley\u201d and A abbreviate the\ntwo-place predicate \u201cis the author of.\u201d It then follows\nthat the sentence\n\n(3) s=s\n\n\nis not at all equivalent to the sentence \n\n(4) \u2203x[(Axw &\n\u2200y(Ayw \u2192 y=x)) &\nx=s].\n\n\nSentence (3), for example, is a necessary truth, while sentence (4) is\nnot. \n\nThe third puzzle relates to true negative existential claims, such as\nthe claim \u201cThe golden mountain does not exist.\u201d Here, once\nagain, by treating definite descriptions as having a logical form\ndistinct from that of proper names, Russell is able to give an account\nof how a speaker may be committed to the truth of a negative\nexistential without also being committed to the belief that the\nsubject term has reference. That is, the claim that Scott does not\nexist is false since \n\n(5) ~\u2203x(x=s)\n\n\nis self-contradictory. (After all, there must exist at least one thing\nthat is identical to s since it is a logical truth that\ns is identical to itself!) In contrast, the claim that a\ngolden mountain does not exist may be true since, assuming that\nG abbreviates the predicate \u201cis golden\u201d and\nM abbreviates the predicate \u201cis a mountain,\u201d\nthere is nothing contradictory about\n\n(6) ~\u2203x(Gx & Mx).\n\n\nRussell\u2019s most important writings relating to his theory of\ndescriptions include not only \u201cOn Denoting\u201d (1905), but\nalso The Principles of Mathematics (1903), Principia\nMathematica (1910) and Introduction to Mathematical\nPhilosophy (1919). (See too Kaplan 1970, Kroon 2009 and Stevens\n2011.) \n5. Russell\u2019s Theory of Neutral Monism\n\nYet another of Russell\u2019s contributions is his defence of\n neutral monism,\n the view that the world consists of just one type of substance which\nis neither exclusively mental nor exclusively physical. Like idealism\n(the view that nothing exists but the mental) and physicalism (the\nview that nothing exists but the physical), neutral monism rejects\ndualism (the view that there exist distinct mental and physical\nsubstances). However, unlike both idealism and physicalism, neutral\nmonism holds that this single existing substance may be viewed in some\ncontexts as being mental and in others as being physical. As Russell\nputs it, \n\n\u201cNeutral monism\u201d \u2013 as opposed to idealistic monism\nand materialistic monism \u2013 is the theory that the things\ncommonly regarded as mental and the things commonly regarded as\nphysical do not differ in respect of any intrinsic property possessed\nby the one set and not by the other, but differ only in respect of\narrangement and context. (CP, Vol. 7, 15)\n\n\nTo help understand this general suggestion, Russell introduces his\nanalogy of a postal directory:\n\nThe theory may be illustrated by comparison with a postal directory,\nin which the same names come twice over, once in alphabetical and once\nin geographical order; we may compare the alphabetical order to the\nmental, and the geographical order to the physical. The affinities of\na given thing are quite different in the two orders, and its causes\nand effects obey different laws. Two objects may be connected in the\nmental world by the association of ideas, and in the physical world by\nthe law of gravitation. \u2026 Just as every man in the directory\nhas two kinds of neighbours, namely alphabetical neighbours and\ngeographical neighbours, so every object will lie at the intersection\nof two causal series with different laws, namely the mental series and\nthe physical series. \u2018Thoughts\u2019 are not different in\nsubstance from \u2018things\u2019; the stream of my thoughts is a\nstream of things, namely of the things which I should commonly be said\nto be thinking of; what leads to its being called a stream of thoughts\nis merely that the laws of succession are different from the physical\nlaws. (CP, Vol. 7, 15)\n\n\nIn other words, when viewed as being mental, a thought or idea may\nhave associated with it other thoughts or ideas that seem related even\nthough, when viewed as being physical, they have very little in\ncommon. As Russell explains, \u201cIn my mind, Caesar may call up\nCharlemagne, whereas in the physical world the two were widely\nsundered\u201d (CP, Vol. 7, 15). Even so, it is a mistake, on this\nview, to postulate two distinct types of thing (the idea of Caesar and\nthe man Caesar) that are composed of two distinct substances (the\nmental and the physical). Instead, \u201cThe whole duality of mind\nand matter, according to this theory, is a mistake; there is only one\nkind of stuff out of which the world is made, and this stuff is called\nmental in one arrangement, physical in the other\u201d (CP, Vol. 7,\n15).\n\nRussell appears to have developed this theory around 1913, while\nworking on his Theory of Knowledge manuscript and on his 1914\nMonist article, \u201cOn the Nature of Acquaintance.\u201d\nDecades later, in 1964, he remarked that \u201cI am not conscious of\nany serious change in my philosophy since I adopted neutral\nmonism\u201d (Eames 1967, 511). Even so, over the next several\ndecades Russell continued to do a large amount of original work,\nauthoring such important books as The Analysis of Mind\n(1921), The Analysis of Matter (1927a), An Inquiry into\nMeaning and Truth (1940) and Human Knowledge: Its Scope and\nLimits (1948).\n\nToday several authors, including David Chalmers (1996, 155), Thomas\nNagel (2002, 209) and Erik Banks (2014, 114), have shown renewed\ninterest in considering Russell\u2019s general approach to the mind.\n\n\nIn addition to the above titles by Russell, Russell\u2019s most\ninfluential writings relating to his theories of metaphysics and\nepistemology include Our Knowledge of the External World\n(1914a), \u201cThe Relation of Sense-Data to Physics\u201d (1914c),\n\u201cThe Philosophy of Logical Atomism\u201d (1918, 1919),\n\u201cOn Propositions: What They Are and How They Mean\u201d (1919b)\nand An Outline of Philosophy (1927b).\n6. Russell\u2019s Atheism\n\nRussell sums up his views about religion quite plainly: \u201cMy own\nview on religion is that of Lucretius. I regard it as a disease born\nof fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race\u201d\n(A1957, 18). According to Russell, not only are most religious beliefs\nintellectually and morally pernicious, the religious point of view\nitself \u201cis a conception quite unworthy of free men\u201d\n(A1957, 17). Throughout his life, Russell thus put significant effort\ninto opposing religious ideas and institutions of all kinds. As he\nreports in his Autobiography, upon arriving at Brixton Prison\nin 1918, \u201cI was much cheered on my arrival by the warder at the\ngate, who had to take particulars about me. He asked my religion, and\nI replied \u2018agnostic.\u2019 He asked how to spell it, and remarked with\na sigh: \u2018Well, there are many religions, but I suppose they all\nworship the same God.\u2019 This remark kept me cheerful for about a\nweek\u201d (1968, 34). \n\nRussell\u2019s discussions about religion fall largely into four\ncategories: his criticisms of arguments favouring the existence of\nGod; his observation that religion has historically served to impede\nthe advancement of knowledge; his observation that religion has\nregularly advanced theories of morality that are more harmful than\ngood; and his analysis of religion, not simply as a body of belief but\nas a mode of feeling.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Russell opened the door to the\ndemystification of religion, writing in plain language at a time when\npeople had been told that serious discussions about religion required\na detailed knowledge of Latin and church history. The result was\ntwofold: first, that many people came to understand religion as a\nsubject about which they were entitled to develop their own beliefs\nand views; second, that arguments from ecclesiastical authority\nsuddenly became less formidable and less influential than they had\nbeen for centuries. In this respect, it is not too much to say that\nRussell did as much to usher in the twentieth century\u2019s age of\nsecularism as Luther did to usher in the sixteenth century\u2019s age of\nProtestantism. As the Nobel Prize committee noted, the 1950 award went\nto Russell \u201cin recognition of his varied and significant\nwritings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of\nthought\u201d (Nobel Media 2020). Russell himself reports that he\nreceived the award primarily for his anti-religious book, Marriage\nand Morals (1969, 30). \n\nRussell\u2019s analysis of traditional arguments in favour of the\nexistence of God appears in both his popular and his philosophical\nwritings. In his book on Leibniz, he discusses Leibniz\u2019s treatment\nof several such arguments, noting that they are \u201cthe weakest\npart in Leibniz\u2019s philosophy, the part most full of\ninconsistencies\u201d (1900, sec. 106, p. 172). In his more popular\nwritings, he repeatedly emphasizes his views about religion, noting\nthat \u201cThe fact that an opinion has been widely held is no\nevidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd\u201d (1929, 58). In his 1922 booklet Free Thought and Official\nPropaganda, he tells his readers that \u201cI am myself a dissenter from all known\nreligions, and I hope that every kind of religious belief will die\nout\u201d (1922a, 1). Later, in his 1941 collection of essays\nLet the People Think, he adds that \u201cmodern science gives us no\nindication whatever of the existence of the soul\u201d (A1941, 113),\nand in the preface to his 1957 book Why I Am Not a\nChristian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects, he notes that \n\u201cI am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that\nthey are untrue\u201d (1957, xi).\n\nRussell\u2019s criticism of arguments traditionally offered in favour of\nthe existence of God includes his discussion of the First Cause\nArgument, the Problem of Evil, the Ontological Argument, the\nTeleological Argument, the Argument from Pre-established Harmony, the\nNatural Law Argument, the Argument from Morality, the Remediation of\nInjustice Argument and the Argument from Religious Experience.\nUnderlying all of these discussions is Hume\u2019s suggestion that\nbelief needs to be proportioned to the available evidence, an idea\nneatly summed up in Russell\u2019s teapot analogy:\n\nIf I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china\nteapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be\nable to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the\nteapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful\ntelescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion\ncannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of\nhuman reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking\nnonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in\nancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled\ninto the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its\nexistence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter\nto the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the\nInquisitor in an earlier time. It is customary to suppose that, if a\nbelief is widespread, there must be something reasonable about it. I\ndo not think this view can be held by anyone who has studied\nhistory. (1952, 547\u20138)\n\n\nThe First Cause (or Cosmological) Argument\nis the argument that since everything has a cause, there must have\nbeen a first cause, and it is to this first cause that we give the\nname God. In response to this argument, Russell notes the obvious: If\neverything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If\neverything must have a creator, then God must have a creator.\nAlternatively, if God can exist without a cause, then it is just as likely\nthat the world can exist without a cause. In fact, this is even more\nlikely than the existence of an uncaused, hypothetical, supernatural\ncreator who manufactures and then intervenes in the world, since there\n\u201cis no reason to suppose that the world had a beginning at\nall\u201d (A1957, 4). To those who suggest that unlike God, since\nevery part of the world has a cause, it follows that the world itself\nmust have a cause, Russell notes that just because every man has a\nmother it does not follow that the human race must have a mother\n(A1957, 152). Put in more formal language, although causation connects\neach contingent stage of the world to the next, it need not follow\nthat there is an \u201cextramundane\u201d creator of the world as a\nwhole (1900, sec. 109, p. 176). To those who claim that without such a\ncreator, there can never be sufficient reason for \u201cwhy there are\nany states at all,\u201d Russell points out that the traditional view\nof God as being uncaused because he exists necessarily is simply\ninconsistent with God's creation of a contingent universe. No series of\ncontingent states may have come about by the necessity that\naccompanies God\u2019s actions, since the contingency of existential\npropositions rests on the assertion that God acts, not from necessity\nbut contingently (1900, sec. 110, p. 177). Thus, either the world\nitself has no supernatural cause or the supernatural cause itself will\nact and exist contingently, and so it, too, cannot be necessary and must require a\ncreator.\n\nRelated to this argument is the Problem of Evil. As Russell\nnotes, the creation of a contingent world could never eliminate\nGod\u2019s responsibility for the existence of evil: \n\nThe world, we are told, was created by a God who is both good and\nomnipotent. Before He created the world He foresaw all the pain and\nmisery that it would contain; He is therefore responsible for all of\nit. It is useless to argue that the pain in the world is due to sin.\nIn the first place, this is not true; it is not sin that causes rivers\nto overflow their banks or volcanoes to erupt. But even if it were\ntrue, it would make no difference. If I were going to beget a child\nknowing that the child was going to be a homicidal maniac, I should be\nresponsible for his crimes. If God knew in advance the sins of which\nman would be guilty, He was clearly responsible for all the\nconsequences of those sins when He decided to create man. (A1957, 22)\n\n\nIn response to the Ontological Argument, the argument that\nsince perfection implies existence, the idea of a non-existent,\nperfect God is self-contradictory, Russell points out that the\nargument rests ultimately on the mistaken claim that existence is a\nproperty or, in Russell\u2019s terminology, a predicate. His reasoning is\nas follows: If existence were a predicate then, like all other\npredicates, it would (or would not) be part of the nature of any given\nsubstance. But upon being created, each such substance would acquire a\nnew predicate. \u201cHence the special position of existence, as a\ncontingent and synthetic predicate, falls to the ground. If all\nsubstances always contain all their predicates, then all substances\nalways contain or do not contain the predicate existence, and God must\nbe as powerless over this predicate as over any other. To add the\npredicate existence must be metaphysically impossible. Thus, either\ncreation is self-contradictory, or, if existence is not a predicate,\nthe ontological argument is unsound\u201d (1900, sec. 115, p.\n185).\n\nIn response to the Teleological Argument (or Argument\nfrom Design), the argument that the complexity and purpose we\nfind in the world shows that there must have been a creator, Russell\npoints out that \u201csince the time of Darwin we understand much\nbetter why living creatures are adapted to their environment. It is\nnot that their environment was made to be suitable to them, but that\nthey grew to be suitable to it, and that is the basis of adaption.\nThere is no evidence of design about it\u201d (A1957, 6). Russell\nalso reminds his readers about the pre-Darwin observation made famous\nby David Hume, that \u201cit is a most astonishing thing that people\ncan believe that this world, with all the things that are in it, with\nall its defects,\u201d is the best that an omnipotent, omniscient\ncreator could have been able to create in millions of years. (A1957,\n6).\n\nIn response to the Argument from Pre-established Harmony, the\nargument that \u201cThe world is so well constructed, we are told,\nthat it must have had a highly skillful Architect\u201d or, as\nLeibniz preferred to say, that \u201cthe harmony of all the monads\ncan only have arisen from a common cause\u201d (1900, sec. 114, p.\n183), Russell notes that this is simply a version of the Argument from\nDesign and that \u201cBeing more palpably inadequate than any of the\nothers, it has acquired a popularity which they have never\nenjoyed\u201d (1900, sec. 114, p. 183).\n\nIn response to the Natural Law Argument, the argument that\nthe existence of laws of nature shows that there must have been a\nlawgiver, Russell points out that the argument arises simply as a result\nof a confusion between natural and human laws (A1957, 5). Human laws\nare commands that we choose to follow or ignore. In contrast, laws of\nnature are simply descriptions of how things in fact are. There is\nthus no need to assume a lawmaker unless the Argument from Design is\nsound, which it is not. Aternatively, if we assume there must\nhave been a lawmaker who brought about these laws, this raises the\nquestion of why the lawmaker chose to make these laws and not others:\n\u201cIf you say that He did it simply from His own good pleasure,\nand without any reason, you then find that there is something which is\nnot subject to law, and so your train of natural law is interrupted.\nIf you say, as more orthodox theologians do, that in all the laws\nwhich God issues He had a reason for giving those laws rather than\nothers \u2013 the reason, of course, being to create the best\nuniverse, although you would never think it to look at it \u2013 if\nthere was a reason for the laws which God gave, then God himself was\nsubject to law, and therefore you do not get any advantage by\nintroducing God as an intermediary\u201d (A1957, 5\u20136). In\neither case, there is no need to postulate a supernatural\nlawmaker.\n\nIn response to the Argument from Morality (or the Divine\nCommand Theory Argument), the argument that there could be no\nright or wrong unless God existed, Russell adapts the reply given by Socrates to Euthyphro 2,300 years earlier (Plato, Euthyphro,\n5d-15e). Assuming there is a difference between right and wrong, is\nthis difference due to God\u2019s commands or not? If it is, then for God\nthere must have originally been \u201cno difference between right and\nwrong, and it is no longer a significant statement to say that God is\ngood\u201d (A1957, 8). Alternatively, if we take a more traditional\ntheological line and insist that God is good, and it is for this\nreason that God commands some actions and not others, then we will\nalso have to say \u201cthat right and wrong have some meaning which\nis independent of God\u2019s fiat, because God\u2019s fiats are good and not\nbad independently of the mere fact that He made them. If you are going\nto say that, you will then have to say that it is not only through God\nthat right and wrong came into being, but that they are in their\nessence logically anterior to God\u201d (A1957, 8). Of course, we\nmight then feel compelled to suggest the existence of a superior\ndeity, one who ordered the God who created world to act as he did, but\nthis option will be of no value to the traditional theist. There is\nalso \u201cthe line that some of the gnostics took up \u2013 a line\nwhich I often thought was a very plausible one \u2013 that as a\nmatter of fact this world that we know was made by the devil at a\nmoment when God was not looking,\u201d but again, this is not the\nkind of option that would give comfort to the traditional theist\n(A1957, 8).\n\nIn response to the Remediation of Injustice Argument, the\nargument that God is needed to bring justice to the world, to ensure\nthat at the end of time the scales of justice have been balanced,\nRussell asks what evidence we have that such remediation is ever going\nto occur. \u201cIn the part of this universe that we know there is\ngreat injustice, and often the good suffer, and often the wicked\nprosper, and one hardly knows which of those is the more annoying; but\nif you are going to have justice in the universe as a whole you have\nto suppose a future life to redress the balance of life here on earth.\nSo they say that there must be a God, and there must be heaven and\nhell in order that in the long run there may be justice\u201d (A1957,\n9). Despite such wishful thinking, we have no concrete evidence that\nsuch remediation is ever going to occur: \u201cSupposing you got a crate of\noranges that you opened, and you found all the top layer of oranges\nbad, you would not argue: \u2018The underneath ones must be good, so as\nto redress the balance.\u2019 You would say: \u2018Probably the whole lot is\na bad consignment,\u2019 and that is really what a scientific person\nwould argue about the universe\u201d (A1957, 9).\n\nFinally, in response to the Argument from Religious\nExperience, the argument that people report having had direct\nexperience of the supernatural or the divine, Russell simply notes\nthat we are just as likely to make mistakes when reporting such\nexperiences as we are to make mistakes in other areas of our lives:\n\u201cIf you have jaundice you see things yellow that are not yellow.\nYou\u2019re making a mistake\u201d (A1957, 161). Thus, it is our total\nbody of evidence that needs to be considered when making such\njudgments, a body of evidence that leans heavily against the existence\nof anything divine or supernatural.\n\nOn the question of whether religion has impeded the advancement of\nknowledge and introduced harmful theories of morality, Russell writes\nequally plainly: \u201cThe objections to religion are of two sorts\n\u2013 intellectual and moral. The intellectual objection is that\nthere is no reason to suppose any religion true; the moral objection\nis that religious precepts date from a time when men were more cruel\nthan they are, and therefore tend to perpetuate inhumanities which the\nmoral conscience of the age would otherwise outgrow\u201d (A1957,\n23). The conclusion to be drawn, says Russell, is that religious faith\nhas served as a shield against the advancement of knowledge, both in\nethics and in the sciences: \u201cWhen two men of science disagree,\nthey do not invoke the secular arm; they wait for further evidence to\ndecide the issue, because, as men of science, they know that neither\nis infallible. But when two theologians differ, since there are no\ncriteria to which either can appeal, there is nothing for it but\nmutual hatred and an open or covert appeal to force\u201d (A1957,\n173). Today, no one \n\nbelieves that the world was created in 4004 BC; but not so very long\nago skepticism on this point was thought an abominable crime \u2026 It is\nno credit to the orthodox that they do not now believe all the\nabsurdities that were believed 150 years ago. The gradual emasculation\nof the Christian doctrine has been effected in spite of the most\nvigorous resistance, and solely as the result of the onslaughts of\nFreethinkers (A1957, 28).\n\n\nThe tortures of the Inquisition, the condoning of slavery in the Bible\nand the Koran, the burning of women and men for witchcraft, the coming together to\npray for deliverance at times of plague (which only led to the further\nspread of disease), all resulted from religious beliefs and practices.\nThe conclusion, says Russell, is obvious: \u201cthe more intense has\nbeen the religion of any period and the more profound has been the\ndogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has\nbeen the state of affairs\u201d (A1957, 15).\n\nIn his own time, Russell was criticized severely for his view that the\nchurch\u2019s attempt to keep sexual knowledge away from the young was\n\u201cextremely dangerous to mental and physical heath\u201d (A1957,\n21). Against the practice of his time, he advocated sex education for\nthe young. He also recommended temporary, childless marriages for\nthose not ready to begin a family and held that \u201cChristian\nethics inevitably, through the emphasis laid upon sexual virtue, did a\ngreat deal to degrade the position of women\u201d (1929,\n60\u201361). In support of his view that the writings handed down by\nthe church fathers were \u201cfull of invectives against\nWoman,\u201d he quotes the historian, W.E.H. Lecky: \u201cWoman was\nrepresented as the door to hell, as the mother of all human ills. She\nshould be ashamed at the very thought that she is a woman. She should\nlive in continual penance, on account of the curses she has brought\nupon the world\u201d (1929, 61). Russell concludes that \u201cIt is\nonly in quite modern times that women have regained the degree of\nfreedom which they enjoyed in the Roman Empire\u201d (1929,\n60\u201361).\n\nAmong Russell\u2019s critics, it was argued that in this case and others\nlike it, Russell had simply got his facts wrong:\n\nIt is incredible that a philosopher of note could be so unreliable, so\nunfamiliar with the fact that early Christianity has exalted the\nconception of women in the adoration given to Mary and the saints, and\nthat by treating marriage as a sacrament it emancipated women of all\nclasses from the old traditions of the absolute authority of parents\nand the seignorial power of feudal lords. It is intellectual blindness\nnot to recognize the revolutionary import of early Christianity,\nwhatever the contemporary feeling concerning the sacrament of marriage\nmay be, when it set itself like a wall against the tides of boundless\nsensuality and impressed upon the Roman world the sanctity of human\nlife. (Kayden 1930, 88)\n\n\nContrary to what was often said about his personal life, it is also\nworth noting that Russell did not practice or defend a libertine\nethic. He thought that sex was a natural need, like food and drink,\nbut that it should not be trivialized by disassociating it \u201cfrom\nserious emotion and from feelings of affection\u201d (1929, 127). As\nAlan Wood notes, the result was that \u201cMore than anyone else, he\nchanged the outlook on sex morality of a whole new generation; and\nduring his lifetime he saw the cause of Women\u2019s Rights, once\nregarded as a crank\u2019s crusade, end up as an established part of the\nlaws and customs of the land\u201d (Wood, 1957, 166). As Wood also\nnotes,\n\nPerhaps the finest tribute to his success is that few people now even\nrealize the nature of the old ideas. Russell, it must be repeated, was\nfighting a cruel and indefensible state of affairs where sexual\nignorance was deliberately fostered, so a boy might think the changes\nof puberty were signs of some dreadful disease, and a girl might marry\nwithout knowing anything of what lay ahead of her on her bridal night;\nwere women were taught to look on sex, not as a source of joy, but of\npainful matrimonial duty; where prudery went to the extent of covering\nthe legs of pianos in draperies; where artificial mystery evoked\nmorbid curiosity, and where humbug went hand in hand with unhappiness\n\u2026 . (Wood, 1957, 174)\n\n\nUnderlying Russell\u2019s writings on religion was also his observation\nthat religion is not simply a body of doctrine but also a vehicle for\nthe expression of emotion. This explains why arguments against the\nexistence of the supernatural, although influential among\nintellectuals, are not the main driving force behind most religious\nbelief (A1957, 9). Instead, religion is based largely on fear and ignorance: our fear of the mysterious, our lack\nof knowledge of natural causes, our fear of death (A1957, 16).\n\nWith regard to the propositional content of religion, or what Russell\ncalls theology, Russell notes that central to the idea of Christianity\nare belief in God, belief in immortality and, at the very least,\n\u201cbelief that Christ was, if not divine, at least the best and\nwisest of men. If you are not going to believe that much about Christ,\nI do not think you have any right to call yourself a Christian\u201d\n(A1957, 2). Since it is this propositional content that varies from\nreligion to religion, it turns out, as a matter of logic, that at most\none religion can be true (A1957, xi).\n\nEven so, as Jack Pitt writes, Russell is more than just a\n\u201cheroic heretic hounding the sacred cows of a sterile tradition\nwhile spreading a new gospel of human freedom and secular\nenlightenment\u201d (Pitt 1975, 152). Instead, \u201cRussell sees\nreligion (as distinct from theology) as essentially a mode of feeling,\nperhaps as a set of attitudes which inevitably have practical consequences\nfor the ethical tone and style of a person\u2019s life\u201d (Pitt 1975,\n160). Russell says much the same thing when he notes that \n\nReligion has three main aspects. In the first place, there are a\nman\u2019s serious personal beliefs, insofar as they have to do with the\nnature of the world and the conduct of life. In the second place there\nis theology. In the third place there is institutionalized religion,\ni.e., the churches. The first of these aspects is somewhat vague, the\nbut word \u201creligion\u201d is coming more and more to be used in\nthis sense. \u2026 What makes my attitude towards religion complex is\nthat, although I consider some form of personal religion highly\ndesirable, and feel many people unsatisfactory through the lack of it,\nI cannot accept the theology of any well-known religion, and I incline\nto think that most churches at most times have done more harm than\ngood. (Schilpp 1944, 725\u20136).\n\n\nOne suggestion about the source of this three-fold division is connected to Russell\u2019s love of Ottoline Morrell. Separating religious feelings from religious belief would have allowed Russell to find some common ground with Morrell\u2019s spiritually, without having to accept any particular theology. (See Swanson, 2019, 93\u20134 for a helpful discussion of this suggestion). An alternative view is that the complexity of Russell\u2019s view was generated by the fact that even our most serious\nemotions and most important feelings need not result solely from the\npropositional content of our beliefs. Among Russell\u2019s most\nfamous suggestions about the nature of the good life is his\nobservation that \u201cThe good life is one inspired by love and\nguided by knowledge\u201d (A1957, 44). For Russell, this is a view so\nbasic that it is more like a goal than a description. As a result, it\nbecomes impossible to think of it as a claim purely connected to propositional content. As\nRussell explains, \n\nSuppose, for instance, your child is ill. Love makes you wish to cure\nit, and science tells you how to do so. There is not an intermediate\nstage of ethical theory, where it is demonstrated that your child had\nbetter be cured. Your act springs directly from desire for an end,\ntogether with knowledge of means. This is equally true of all acts,\nwhether good or bad. (A1957, 48)\n\n\nThe result is that in many cases, emotion drives belief: \u201cI\ncannot, therefore, prove that my view of the good life is right; I can\nonly state my view, and hope that as many as possible will\nagree\u201d (A1957, 44).\n\nThese observations should not be interpreted as giving unfettered licence\nto religious belief. As Russell points out \u201csome very important\nvirtues are more likely to be found among those who reject religious\ndogmas than among those who accept them. I think this applies\nespecially to the virtue of truthfulness or intellectual integrity. I\nmean by intellectual integrity the habit of deciding vexed questions\nin accordance with the evidence, or of leaving them undecided where\nthe evidence is inconclusive\u201d (A1957, 169). In the case of\nreligion, it is not simply that such virtues are ignored. Instead,\nthey are positively frustrated: \n\nIf theology is thought necessary to virtue and if candid inquirers see\nno reason to think the theology true, the authorities will set to work\nto discourage candid inquiry. In former centuries, they did so by\nburning the inquirers at the stake. In Russia they still have methods\nwhich are little better; but in Western countries the authorities have\nperfected somewhat milder forms of persuasion. Of these, schools are\nperhaps the most important: the young must be preserved from hearing\nthe arguments in favour of the opinions which the authorities dislike,\nand those who nevertheless persist in showing an inquiring disposition\nwill incur social displeasure and, if possible, be made to feel\nmorally reprehensible. (A1957, 171)\n\n\nSocieties as well as individuals, says Russell, need to choose whether the good life is one that is guided by honest inquiry\nand the weighing of evidence, or by the familiarity of superstition\nand the comforts of religion.\n\nRussell\u2019s writings on religion and related topics include\nChapter 15 of his A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of\nLeibniz (1900), as well as A Free Man\u2019s Worship (1923b), \nWhy I Am Not a Christian (1927c), reprinted in\nWhy I am Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related\nSubjects (A1957), \u201cThe Existence and Nature of God\u201d (1939), \u201cIs There a God?\u201d (1952) and What I Believe (A2013). \n7. Russell\u2019s Social and Political Philosophy\n\nRussell\u2019s significant social influence stems from three main\nsources: his long-standing social activism, his many writings on the\nsocial and political issues of his day as well as on more theoretical\nconcerns, and his popularizations of numerous technical writings in\nphilosophy and the natural sciences. \n\nAmong Russell\u2019s many popularizations are his two best-selling\nworks, The Problems of Philosophy (1912) and A History of\nWestern Philosophy (1945). Both of these books, as well as his\nnumerous books popularizing science, have done much to educate and\ninform generations of general readers. His History is still\nwidely read and did much to initiate twentieth-century research on a\nwide range of historical figures from the\n presocratics\n to\n Leibniz.\n His Problems is still used as an introductory textbook over\na century after it was first published. Both books can be read by the\nlayman with satisfaction. Other popular books, particularly those\nrelating to developments in modern science such as The ABC of\nAtoms (1923a) and The ABC of Relativity (1925), are now\nof more historical interest. Even so, they continue to convey\nsomething of the intellectual excitement associated with advances in\ntwentieth-century science and philosophy. \n\nNaturally enough, Russell saw a link between education in this broad\nsense and social progress. As he put it, \u201cEducation is the key\nto the new world\u201d (1926, 83). Partly this is due to our need to\nunderstand nature, but equally important is our need to understand\neach other:\n\n\nThe thing, above all, that a teacher should endeavor to produce in his\npupils, if democracy is to survive, is the kind of tolerance that\nsprings from an endeavor to understand those who are different from\nourselves. It is perhaps a natural human impulse to view with horror\nand disgust all manners and customs different from those to which we\nare used. Ants and savages put strangers to death. And those who have\nnever traveled either physically or mentally find it difficult to\ntolerate the queer ways and outlandish beliefs of other nations and\nother times, other sects and other political parties. This kind of\nignorant intolerance is the antithesis of a civilized outlook, and is\none of the gravest dangers to which our overcrowded world is exposed.\n(1950, 121)\n\n\nIt is in this same context that Russell is famous for suggesting that\na widespread reliance upon evidence, rather than superstition, would\nhave enormous social consequences: \u201cI wish to propose for the\nreader\u2019s favourable consideration,\u201d says Russell, \u201ca\ndoctrine which may, I fear, appear wildly paradoxical and subversive.\nThe doctrine in question is this: that it is undesirable to believe a\nproposition when there is no ground whatever for supposing it\ntrue\u201d (A1928, 11). \n\nUnlike Russell\u2019s views about the importance of education, the\nprecise connection between Russell\u2019s political activism and his\nmore theoretical work has been more controversial. In part, this has\nbeen because Russell himself repeatedly maintained that he saw no\nsignificant connection between his philosophical work and his\npolitical activism. Others have seen things differently. One of the\nbest summaries is given by Alan Wood: \n\nRussell sometimes maintained, partly I think out of perverseness, that\nthere was no connection between his philosophical and political\nopinions. \u2026 But in fact I think there are perfectly obvious\nconnections between Russell\u2019s philosophical and other views.\n\u2026 To begin with, it is natural enough to find an analytic\nanti-monist philosopher like Russell upholding the individual against\nthe state, whereas Hegel did the reverse \u2026 [In addition, the]\nwhole bent of Russell\u2019s mind in philosophy was an attempt to\neliminate the a priori and to accentuate the empirical; and\nthere was exactly the same trend in his political thinking \u2026\nUnless it is realized that Russell\u2019s approach to political\nquestions was usually empirical and practical, based on the evidence\nof the moment and not on a priori principles and\npreconceptions, it is quite impossible to understand why his views\nappeared to vary so much. This was perfectly legitimate, and even\npraiseworthy, in a world which never stays the same, and where\nchanging circumstances continually change the balance of arguments on\ndifferent sides. (Wood 1957, 73\u20134)\n\n\nThus, in addition to Russell\u2019s numerous contributions to the\npolitics of his day, he also contributed significantly to our\nunderstanding of the social world around us. Among Russell\u2019s\nmore theoretical contributions were his anticipation of John\nMackie\u2019s error theory in ethics, the view that moral judgments\nare cognitive (that is, they are either true or false), but because of\ntheir content they in fact are invariably false. (Mackie\u2019s paper\n\u201cThe Refutation of Morals\u201d appeared in 1946;\nRussell\u2019s paper \u201cIs There an Absolute Good?\u201d,\nalthough not published until 1988 was first delivered in 1922.)\n\nRussell also anticipated the modern theory of emotivism (as introduced\nby\n A.J. Ayer\n in his 1936 Language, Truth and Logic), arguing that\n\u201cPrimarily, we call something \u2018good\u2019 when we desire\nit, and \u2018bad\u2019 when we have an aversion from it\u201d\n(1927b, 242), a view that \u201che had been flirting with since\n1913\u201d (see the entry on\n Russell\u2019s Moral Philosophy\n in this encyclopedia; see too Schilpp 1944, 719f). Even so, Russell\nremained less than satisfied with his views on meta-ethics for most of\nhis life (CP, Vol. 11, 310). \n\nThis dissatisfaction appears not to have extended to his work in\npolitical theory. There Russell focused primarily on the notion of\npower, or what he called \u201cthe production of intended\neffects\u201d (1938, 35). As V.J. McGill writes, \u201cThe concept\nof power overshadows all of Russell\u2019s political and economic\nwritings\u201d (Schilpp 1944, 581). Russell himself summarizes his\npoint of view with the observation that \u201cThe laws of social\ndynamics are \u2013 so I shall contend \u2013 only capable of being\nstated in terms of power in its various forms\u201d (1938, 15). As a\nresult, it is only by understanding power in all its human\ninstantiations that we understand the social world around us. \n\nRussell\u2019s cataloging of the perceived evils of his age are well\nknown. (As Popper neatly sums up Russell\u2019s general outlook, \u201cwe\nare clever, perhaps too clever, but we are also wicked; and this\nmixture of cleverness and wickedness lies at the root of our\ntroubles\u201d [1956, 365].) Even so, underlying Russell\u2019s criticism\nof both the political left and the political right lies a common\nworry: the unequal distribution of power. As McGill sums up,\n\u201cEvidently he has become convinced that the thirst for Power is\nthe primary danger of mankind, that possessiveness is evil mainly\nbecause it promotes the power of man over man\u201d (Schilpp 1944,\n581). The problem with this analysis and of Russell\u2019s desire for\na more equitable distribution of power is that any proposed solution\nappears to lead to paradox: \n\nSuppose certain men join a movement to disestablish Power, or to\ndistribute it more equally among the people! If they are successful,\nthey carry out the behest of Power, becoming themselves as powerful,\nin terms of Mr. Russell\u2019s definition, as any tyrant. Even though\nthey spread the good life to millions, the more successful they are,\nthe more usurpatious and dangerous. (Schilpp 1944, 586)\n\n\nLike his writings about religion, Russell\u2019s writings in ethics\nand politics brought him to the attention of large numbers of\nnon-academic readers. His most influential books on these topics\ninclude his Principles of Social Reconstruction (1916),\nOn Education (1926), Marriage and Morals (1929),\nThe Conquest of Happiness (1930), The Scientific\nOutlook (1931), and Power: A New Social Analysis\n(1938).\n8. Contemporary Russell Scholarship\n\nSince his death in 1970, Russell\u2019s reputation as a philosopher\nhas continued to grow. This increase in reputation has been\naccompanied by a corresponding increase in scholarship. Older\nfirst-hand accounts of Russell\u2019s life, such as Dora\nRussell\u2019s The Tamarisk Tree (1975, 1981, 1985),\nKatharine Tait\u2019s My Father Bertrand Russell (1975) and\nRonald Clark\u2019s The Life of Bertrand Russell (1975),\nhave been supplemented by more recent accounts, including Caroline\nMoorehead\u2019s Bertrand Russell (1992), John\nSlater\u2019s Bertrand Russell (1994), and Ray Monk\u2019s\nBertrand Russell: The Spirit of Solitude (1996) and\nBertrand Russell: The Ghost of Madness (2000). \n\nThis increase in scholarship has benefited greatly from the existence\nof the\n Bertrand Russell Archives\n at McMaster University, where the bulk of Russell\u2019s library and\nliterary estate are housed, and from the\n Bertrand Russell Research Centre,\n also housed at McMaster. Books such as Nicholas Griffin\u2019s\nSelected Letters of Bertrand Russell (1992, 2001), Gregory\nLandini\u2019s Russell\u2019s Hidden Substitutional Theory\n(1998) and Bernard Linsky\u2019s The Evolution of Principia\nMathematica (2011) have helped make public archival material\nthat, in the past, has been available only to specialists. Since 1983\nthe\n Bertrand Russell Editorial Project,\n initiated by John Slater and Kenneth Blackwell, has also begun to\nrelease authoritative, annotated editions of Russell\u2019s\n Collected Papers.\n When complete, this collection will run to over 35 volumes and will\nbring together all of Russell\u2019s writings, other than his\ncorrespondence and previously published monographs. \n\nRecent scholarship has also helped remind readers of the influence\nRussell\u2019s students had on Russell\u2019s philosophy.\n Ludwig Wittgenstein\n and Frank Ramsey especially presented Russell with helpful criticisms\nof his work and new problems to solve. Both men pushed Russell to\ndevelop new theories in logic and epistemology. Despite the fact that\nWittgenstein was less than satisfied with Russell\u2019s Introduction\nto his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921), Michael\nPotter\u2019s Wittgenstein\u2019s Notes on Logic (2009) and\nthe introductory materials published in Russell\u2019s Theory of\nKnowledge: The 1913 Manuscript (CP, Vol. 7) show the extent and\nfruitfulness of the interaction between teacher and student. \n\nSince Russell\u2019s death, debate has also taken place over the\nultimate importance of Russell\u2019s contributions, not just to\nphilosophy, but to other disciplines as well. Advocates of\nRussell\u2019s inclusion in the canon remind readers that few have\ndone more to advance both formal logic and analytic philosophy. As P.F. Strawson concludes, Russell\u2019s influence \u201con the philosophy of his and our time has perhaps been greater than that of any other single individual\u201d (Strawson 1984, 104). \n Critics of Russell\u2019s inclusion in the canon, or at least of his canonization, remind\nreaders of Russell\u2019s early enthusiasm for British imperialism\n(1967, 134) and of his controversial comments about eugenics and race\n(1929, 259, 266). Others have noted his apparent early antisemitism\nand his advocacy of a preemptive nuclear war against the Soviet Union\nfollowing World War II (Hook 1976, Stone 1981, Perkins 1994, Blitz\n2002). On the issue of a preemptive war, Russell himself later denied\nhe had ever advocated such a course of action. However, after carefully \nreviewing the historical record, biographer Ronald Clark\ncomes to a different conclusion. Clark is also unequivocal about\nRussell\u2019s lack of sincerity on the issue: \u201cIf the\nsuggestion that he deliberately tried to conceal his earlier views is\nrepugnant, the record does not really allow any other conclusion to be\ndrawn\u201d (Clark 1975, 530). Perhaps as a result of such\nobservations, many readers remain undecided when attempting to\nevaluate Russell\u2019s overall contribution to the intellectual life\nof the twentieth century. \n\nMonk\u2019s two volumes are a significant case in point. In addition\nto his ground-breaking biographical work, Monk relates\nWittgenstein\u2019s humorous suggestion that all of Russell\u2019s\nbooks should be bound in two colours, \u201cthose dealing with\nmathematical logic in red \u2013 and all students of philosophy\nshould read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue\n\u2013 and no one should be allowed to read them\u201d (Monk 2000,\n278). Others, such as Peter Stone, have argued that such caricatures\nare based on \u201ca misunderstanding of the nature of Russell as a\npolitical figure\u201d (2003, 89) and that \u201cWhatever one thinks\nof Russell\u2019s politics, he was one of the few public figures in\nthe west to stand against capitalism without succumbing to illusions\nabout Stalinist Russia. If for no other reason than this, Russell\ndeserves some credit for his political instincts\u201d (2003, 85).\n(See, for example, Russell 1920 and 1922c, and Russell et al. 1951.)\n\nHow is the ordinary reader to decide between such conflicting\nevaluations? Unlike the many logical advances Russell introduced, in\npolitics he is still usually understood to be more of an advocate than\na theoretician. As a result, his reputation as a political thinker has\nnot been as high as his reputation in logic, metaphysics and\nepistemology. \n\nEven so, regardless of his many particular contributions,\nRussell\u2019s lasting reputation has also benefited significantly\nfrom his constant willingness to abandon unsupported theories and\noutdated beliefs. To his great credit, when new evidence presented\nitself, Russell was always among the first to take it into account:\n\u201cAgainst my will, in the course of my travels, the belief that\neverything worth knowing was known at Cambridge gradually wore off. In\nthis respect,\u201d says Russell, \u201cmy travels were very useful\nto me\u201d (1967, 133). \n\nA short anecdote recounted in Russell\u2019s Autobiography\nis also typical. As a young man, he says, he spent part of each day\nfor many weeks \n\nreading Georg Cantor, and copying out the gist of him into a notebook.\nAt that time I falsely supposed all his arguments to be fallacious,\nbut I nevertheless went through them all in the minutest detail. This\nstood me in good stead when later on I discovered that all the\nfallacies were mine. (1967, 127)\n\n",
