In a more popular view,\nthis is the thesis that, roughly, there is no mind-body interaction\nstrictly speaking, for there is only a non-causal relationship of\nharmony, parallelism, or correspondence between mind and body.\nCertainly, the pre-established harmony is important for a proper\nunderstanding of Leibniz\u2019s philosophy of mind. But there is much\nmore to be considered, and even when it comes to the pre-established\nharmony, this more popular view needs to be refined, particularly\ninsofar as it suggests that Leibniz accepts a roughly Cartesian,\nalbeit non-interactionist dualism. He does not accept such a dualism,\nand in fact, Leibniz is justly famous for his critiques not only of\nmaterialism but also of any dualism of this sort. In short, he made\nimportant contributions to a number of classical topics in the\nphilosophy of mind, including materialism, dualism, and mind-body\ninteraction.\n\nBut Leibniz had much to say about the philosophy of mind that goes\nwell beyond these traditionally important topics. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, his system sometimes contains ideas of relevance even to\ncontemporary discussions in the cognitive sciences. More generally, he\ndiscusses in depth the nature of perception and thought (conscious and\nunconscious) and the nature of human motivation and striving (or, as\nhe would say, appetition).

Matter and Thought\n\nFor present purposes, we may think of materialism as the view that\neverything that exists is material (or physical) with this view\nclosely allied to another, namely, that mental states and processes\nare either identical to, or realized by, physical states and\nprocesses. Leibniz remained opposed to materialism throughout his\ncareer, particularly as it figured in the writings of Epicurus and\nHobbes. The realms of the mental and the physical, for Leibniz, form\ntwo distinct realms\u2014but not in a way conducive to dualism or the\nview that there exists both thinking substance and extended substance.\nBy opposing both materialism and dualism, Leibniz carved himself an\ninteresting place in the history of views concerning the relationship\nbetween thought and matter.\n\nMost of Leibniz\u2019s arguments against materialism are directly\naimed at the thesis that perception and consciousness can be given\nmechanical (i.e. physical) explanations. His position is that\nperception and consciousness cannot possibly be explained\nmechanically, and, hence, could not be physical processes. His most\nfamous argument against the possibility of materialism is found in\nsection 17 of the Monadology (1714):\n\nOne is obliged to admit that perception and what depends upon\nit is inexplicable on mechanical principles, that is, by\nfigures and motions. In imagining that there is a machine whose\nconstruction would enable it to think, to sense, and to have\nperception, one could conceive it enlarged while retaining the same\nproportions, so that one could enter into it, just like into a\nwindmill. Supposing this, one should, when visiting within it, find\nonly parts pushing one another, and never anything by which to explain\na perception. Thus it is in the simple substance, and not in the\ncomposite or in the machine, that one must look for perception. (G VI,\n609/A&G 215)\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s argument seems to be this: the visitor of the machine,\nupon entering it, would observe nothing but the properties of the\nparts and the relations they bear to one another. But no explanation\nof perception or consciousness can possibly be deduced from this\nconglomerate. No matter how complex the inner workings of this\nmachine, nothing about them reveals that what is being observed are\nthe inner workings of a conscious being. Hence, materialism must be\nfalse, for there is no possible way that the purely mechanical\nprinciples of materialism can account for the phenomena of\nconsciousness. (For detailed discussion of this argument, see Lodge\nand Bobro 1998; Lodge 2014.)\n\nIn other writings, Leibniz suggests exactly what characteristic it is\nof perception and consciousness for which the mechanical principles of\nmaterialism cannot account. The following passages, the first from the\nNew System of Nature (1695), the second from the Reply to\nBayle (1702), are revealing in this regard:\n\nFurthermore, by means of the soul or form, there is a true unity which\ncorresponds to what is called the I in us; such a thing could\nnot occur in artificial machines, nor in the simple mass of matter,\nhowever organized it may be. (G IV, 482/W&F 16)\n\n\nBut in addition to the general principles which establish the monads\nof which compound things are merely the results, internal experience\nrefutes the Epicurean [i.e. materialist] doctrine. This experience is\nthe consciousness which is in us of this I which apperceives\nthings which occur in the body. This perception cannot be explained by\nfigures and movements. (G IV, 559f./W&F 113)\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s point is that whatever is the subject of perception\nand consciousness must be truly one, a single \u201cI\u201d properly\nregarded as one conscious being. An aggregate of matter is\nnot truly one and so cannot be regarded as a single I capable\nof being the subject of a unified mental life. This interpretation\nfits nicely with Lebniz\u2019s oft-repeated definition of perception\nas \u201cthe representation in the simple of the compound, or of that\nwhich is outside\u201d (Principles of Nature and Grace,\nsec.2 (1714)). More explicitly, in a letter to Antoine Arnauld of 9\nOctober 1687, Leibniz wrote that \u201cin natural perception and\nsensation, it is enough for what is divisible and material and\ndispersed into many entities to be expressed or represented in a\nsingle indivisible entity or in a substance which is endowed with\ngenuine unity.\u201d If perception (and hence, consciousness)\nessentially involves a representation of a variety of content in a\nsimple, indivisible \u201cI,\u201d then we may construct\nLeibniz\u2019s argument against materialism as follows: Materialism\nholds that matter can explain (is identical with, can give rise to)\nperception. A perception is a state whereby a variety of content is\nrepresented in a true unity. Thus, whatever is not a true unity cannot\ngive rise to perception. Whatever is divisible is not a true unity.\nMatter is infinitely divisible. Hence, matter cannot form a true\nunity. Hence, matter cannot explain (be identical with, give rise to)\nperception. If matter cannot explain (be identical to, give rise to)\nperception, then materialism is false. Hence, materialism is\nfalse.\n\nLeibniz rejected materialism on the grounds that it could not, in\nprinciple, ever capture the \u201ctrue unity\u201d of perceptual\nconsciousness, that characteristic of the self which can\nsimultaneously unify a manifoldness of perceptual content. If this is\nLeibniz\u2019s argument, it is of some historical interest that it\nbears striking resemblances to contemporary objections to certain\nmaterialist theories of mind. Many contemporary philosophers have\nobjected to some versions of materialism on the basis of thought\nexperiments similar to Leibniz\u2019s, experiments designed to show\nthat qualia and consciousness are bound to elude certain materialist\nconceptions of the mind (cf. Searle 1980; Nagel 1974; McGinn 1989;\nJackson 1982). It is also of historical interest that Leibniz coupled\nhis rejection of materialism with a version of naturalism (or what\nhe would have regarded as naturalism - see Jorgensen 2019).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s rejection of materialist conceptions of the mind was\ncoupled with a strong opposition to dualistic views concerning the\nrelationship between mind and body, particularly the substance dualism\nthat figured in the philosophy of Descartes and his followers.\nAccording to this dualism, the world fundamentally consists of two\ndisparate substances: extended material substance (body) and\nunextended thinking substance (mind). This bifurcation, of course,\ncarries no burden of holding that the operations of the mental are\nrealized by the operations of the physical. But despite his claim that\nconsciousness and perception cannot be realized by, nor reduced to,\nthe mechanical operations of matter, Leibniz found the alternative of\npostulating two distinct kinds of substance equally implausible.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s opposition to Cartesian dualism stems not from a\nrejection of unextended substance, but from his denial of the\nexistence of genuine extended material substance. To begin with,\nLeibniz held the Scholastic thesis that \u201cbeing\u201d and\n\u201cone\u201d are equivalent. He writes to Arnauld: \u201cTo be\nbrief, I hold as axiomatic the identical proposition which varies only\nin emphasis: that what is not truly one being is not truly\none being either\u201d (30 April 1687; G II, 97/LA 121). For\nLeibniz, in order for something to count as a real being\u2014a\nsubstance\u2014it must be \u201ctruly one,\u201d an entity endowed\nwith genuine unity. And, as we saw above, in order for something to be\na genuine unity, it must be a simple, indivisible entity.\n\u201cSubstantial unity,\u201d he writes, \u201crequires a\ncomplete, indivisible and naturally indestructible entity\u201d (to\nArnauld, 28 November 1686; G II, 76/LA 94). But matter is extended,\nand thus, Leibniz believes, infinitely divisible. Hence, there is no\nsuch thing, for Leibniz, as material substance.\n\nThere is a positive thesis which goes hand-in-hand with\nLeibniz\u2019s negative thesis against material substance and which\nhelps to explain further his rejection of material substance. It is\nsummarized in the following passage from a letter to Arnauld of 30\nApril 1687:\n\nI believe that where there are only beings through aggregation,\nthere will not even be real beings. For every being through\naggregation presupposes beings endowed with a true unity, because it\nobtains its reality from nowhere but that of its constituents, so that\nit will have no reality at all if each constituent being is still an\nentity through aggregation; or else, one must yet seek another basis\nto its reality, which in this way, if one must constantly go on\nsearching, can never be found\u2026. If there are aggregates of\nsubstances, there must also be genuine substances from which all the\naggregates result. One must therefore necessarily arrive either at\nmathematical points from which certain authors make up extension, or\nat Epicurus\u2019 and M. Cordemoy\u2019s atoms (which you, like me,\ndismiss), or else one must acknowledge that no reality can be found in\nbodies, or finally one must recognize certain substances in them that\npossess a true unity. (G II, 96/LA 120)\n\n\nAccording to Leibniz, bodies (qua material) are aggregates, and an\naggregate, of course, is not a substance on account of its lack of\nunity. The claim in the above passage is that whatever being or\nreality an aggregate has derives from the being and reality of its\nconstituents. Thus, Leibniz thinks that if a body is to have any\nreality at all, if it is to be more than a mere \u201cphenomenon,\nlacking all reality as would a coherent dream,\u201d then it must\nultimately be composed of things which are real beings. Atoms, he\nclaims, are unfit for this role, because they are themselves extended\nbeings, and for Leibniz, divisibility is of the essence of extension.\nThat is, those who believe in indivisible atoms make matter\n\u201cdivisible in one place, indivisible in another\u201d (On\nNature Itself (1698); G IV, 513/A&G 165), but \u201cwe\ncannot explain why bodies of a definite smallness [i.e. atoms] should\nnot be further divisible\u201d (Primary Truths (1686); C\n522/A&G 34). Every extended mass, for Leibniz, is composed of\nextended parts, and so even if we could conceive of an atom as\ncomposed of parts which cannot be physically divided, \u201can\ninvincible attachment of one part to another would not at all destroy\nthe diversity of these parts\u201d (New System of Nature,\n(1695); G IV, 482/W&F 16), or it would not at all overcome the\nfact that it is an aggregate composed of parts and not truly one\nbeing. Likewise, mathematical points, \u201ceven an infinity of\npoints gathered into one, will not make extension,\u201d (to Des\nBosses, 30 April 1709; G II, 370/L 597) and so cannot be understood as\nthe constituents of extended bodies. Hence, Leibniz opts for the last\nof the above quoted alternatives: the constituents of bodies are\n\u201ccertain substances \u2026 that possess a true unity.\u201d\nThese substances are partless, unextended, and indivisible, and\ntherefore real beings in Leibniz\u2019s sense. Indeed, in several\nwritings, Leibniz invites us to conceive of these substances on the\nmodel of our notion of souls. These simple substances are the only\nthings which suffice for grounding the reality of bodies. To be sure,\nsubstances, Leibniz tells us, do not constitute a body as parts of the\nbody, but as the \u201cfirst elements,\u201d or \u201cprimitive\nunities,\u201d of the body. As he sometimes puts it, bodies\n\u201cresult from\u201d these constitutive unities. That is, bodies\njust are aggregates of substances which appear to us as\nextended corporeal phenomena, though they are\n\u201cwell-founded\u201d phenomena; they have their foundation in\nreal beings.\n\nIn short, Leibniz stands in a special position with respect to the\nhistory of views concerning thought and its relationship to matter. He\nrejects the materialist position that thought and consciousness can be\ncaptured by purely mechanical principles. But he also rejects the\ndualist position that the universe must therefore be bifurcated into\ntwo different kinds of substance, thinking substance and material\nsubstance. Rather, it is his view that the world consists solely of\none type of substance, though there are infinitely many\nsubstances of that type. These substances are partless, unextended\nentities, some of which are endowed with thought and consciousness,\nand others of which found the phenomenality of the corporeal world.\nThe sum of these views secures Leibniz a distinctive position in the\nhistory of the philosophy of mind.\n2. Denial of Mind-Body Interaction, Assertion of Pre-established Harmony\n\nA central philosophical issue of the seventeenth century concerned the\napparent causal relations which hold between the mind and the body. In\nmost seventeenth-century settings, this issue was discussed within the\ncontext of substance dualism, the view that mind and body are\ndifferent kinds of substance. As noted above, Leibniz remained\nfundamentally opposed to dualism. But although Leibniz held that there\nis only one type of substance in the world, and thus that mind and\nbody are ultimately composed of the same kind of substance (a version\nof monism), he also held that mind and body are metaphysically\ndistinct. There are a variety of interpretations of what this\nmetaphysical distinctness consists in for Leibniz, but on any\nplausible interpretation it is safe to assume (as Leibniz seems to\nhave done) that for any person P, P\u2019s mind is\na distinct substance (a soul) from P\u2019s body. With this\nassumption in hand, we may formulate the central issue in the form of\na question: how is it that certain mental states and events are\ncoordinated with certain bodily states and events, and vice-versa?\nThere were various attempts to answer this question in Leibniz\u2019s\ntime period. For Descartes, the answer was mind-body interactionism:\nthe mind can causally influence the body and (most commentators have\nheld) vice-versa. For Malebranche, the answer was that neither created\nminds nor bodies can enter into causal relations because God is the\nonly causally efficient being in the universe. God causes certain\nbodily states and events on the occasion of certain mental states and\nevents, and vice-versa. Leibniz found Descartes\u2019 answer\nunintelligible (cf. Theodicy, sec. 60; G VI, 135f.) and\nMalebranche\u2019s excessive because miraculous (cf. Letter to\nArnauld, 14 July 1686; G II, 57/LA 65).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s account of mind-body causation was in terms of his\nfamous doctrine of the pre-established harmony. According to\nthe latter, (1) no state of a created substance has as a real cause\nsome state of another created substance (i.e. a denial of\ninter-substantial causality); (2) every non-initial, non-miraculous,\nstate of a created substance has as a real cause some previous state\nof that very substance (i.e. an affirmation of intra-substantial\ncausality); and (3) each created substance is programmed at creation\nsuch that all its natural states and actions are carried out in\nconformity with all the natural states and actions of every other\ncreated substance.\n\nFormulating (1) through (3) in the language of minds and bodies,\nLeibniz held that no mental state has as a real cause some state of\nanother created mind or body, and no bodily state has as a real cause\nsome state of another created mind or body. Further, every\nnon-initial, non-miraculous, mental state of a substance has as a real\ncause some previous state of that mind, and every non-initial,\nnon-miraculous, bodily state has as a real cause some previous state\nof that body. Finally, created minds and bodies are programmed at\ncreation such that all their natural states and actions are carried\nout in mutual coordination.\n\nAccording to Leibniz, what appear to be real causal relations\nbetween mind and body are, in metaphysical reality, the mutual\nconformity or coordination of mind and body\u2014in accordance with\n(3)\u2014with no interaction or divine intervention involved. For\nexample, suppose that Smith is pricked with a pin (call this bodily\nstate Sb) and pain ensues (call this mental state\nSm), a case of apparent body to mind causation. Leibniz would\nsay that in such a case some state of Smith\u2019s mind (soul) prior\nto Sm was the real cause of Sm and Sb was\nnot a causal factor in the obtaining of Sm. Suppose now that\nSmith has a desire to raise his arm (call this mental state\nSm), and the raising of his arm ensues (call this bodily\nstate Sb), a case of apparent mind to body causation. Leibniz\nwould say that in such a case some state of Smith\u2019s body prior\nto Sb was the real cause of Sb and Sm was\nnot a causal factor in the obtaining of Sb. So although\nsubstances do not causally interact, their states accommodate one\nanother as if there were causal interaction among\nsubstances.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that Leibniz did think that there was a\nsense in which one could say that mental events influence bodily\nevents and vice-versa. He wrote to Antoine Arnauld that although\n\u201cone particular substance has no physical influence on another\n\u2026 nevertheless, one is quite right to say that my will is the\ncause of this movement of my arm \u2026; for the one expresses\ndistinctly what the other expresses more confusedly, and one must\nascribe the action to the substance whose expression is more\ndistinct\u201d (28 November 1686 (draft); G II, 71/LA 87). In this\npassage, Leibniz sets forth what he takes the metaphysical reality of\napparent inter-substantial causation to amount to. We begin with the\nthesis that every created substance perceives the entire universe,\nthough only a portion of it is perceived distinctly, most of it being\nperceived unconsciously, and, hence, confusedly. Now consider two\ncreated substances, x and y (x not\nidentical to y), where some state of x is said to be\nthe cause of some state of y. Leibniz\u2019s analysis is\nthis: when the causal state of affairs occurred, the relevant\nperceptions of substance x became more distinct, while the\nrelevant perceptions of substance y became more confused.\nInsofar as the relevant perceptions of x become increasingly\ndistinct, it is \u201ccausally\u201d active; insofar as the relevant\nperceptions of substance y become increasingly confused, it\nis passive. In general, causation is to be understood as an increase\nin distinctness on the part of the causally active substance and an\nincrease in confusedness on the part of the passively affected\nsubstance. Again, each substance is programmed at creation to be\nactive/passive at the relevant moment with no occurrence of real\nsubstantial interaction.\n\nIt is difficult to say exactly why Leibniz denied inter-substantial\ncausation. Some of the things he tells us, in both private and public\nwritings, seem unsatisfactory. For example, in Primary Truths\n(1686?), we are given this:\n\nStrictly speaking, one can say that no created substance exerts a\nmetaphysical action or influx on any other thing. For, not to\nmention the fact that one cannot explain how something can pass from\none thing into the substance of another, we have already shown that\nfrom the notion of each and every thing follows all of its future\nstates. What we call causes are only concurrent requisites, in\nmetaphysical rigor. (C 521/A&G 33)\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s first reason for denying inter-substantial causation,\nthat \u201cone cannot explain how something can pass from one thing\ninto the substance of another,\u201d is a clear reference to the\ninflux theory of causation. Leibniz found this theory\ninconsistent with his conception of substance. Influx theory could\nonly explain causal relations between entities with parts, according\nto Leibniz. It is through these parts that \u201csomething can pass\nfrom one thing into \u2026 another.\u201d But Leibnizian substances\ndo not have parts in the requisite sense. (For more on influx theory,\nsee O\u2019Neil 1993.) Leibniz also gives a reason tied to his\ncomplete concept theory of substance, according to which \u201cthe\nnature of an individual substance or of a complete being is to have a\nnotion so complete that it is sufficient to contain and to allow us to\ndeduce from it all the predicates of the subject to which this notion\nis attributed\u201d (Discourse on Metaphysics, sec. 8; (G\nIV, 433/A&G 41)). But there are, it seems, at least two problems\nwith this explanation. First, Leibniz moves rather quickly from a\nconceptual explanation of substance in terms of the complete concept\ntheory to the conclusion that this consideration is sufficient to\nexplain the activity of concrete substances. Second, even if\nconceptual considerations about substances were sufficient to explain\ntheir apparent causal activity, it does not seem to follow that\nsubstances do not interact\u2014unless one is assuming that causal\noverdetermination is not a genuine possibility. Leibniz seems to be\nassuming just that but without argument. \n\nSometimes Leibniz gives a more familiar line of reasoning. At\nMonadology 7, we read this:\n\nThere is no way of explaining how a monad can be altered or changed\ninternally by some other creature, since one cannot transpose anything\nin it, nor can one conceive of any internal motion that can be\nexcited, directed, augmented, or diminished within it, as can be done\nin composites, where there can be change among the parts. The monads\nhave no windows through which something can enter or leave. Accidents\ncannot be detached, nor can they go about outside of substances, as\nthe sensible species of the Scholastics once did. Thus, neither\nsubstance nor accident can enter a monad from without. (G VI,\n607/A&G 213f.)\n\n\nHe seems to think that causal interaction between two beings requires\nthe transmission or transposition of the parts of those beings. But\nsubstances are simple unextended entities which contain no parts.\nThus, there is no way to explain how one substance could influence\nanother. Unfortunately, however, this line of reasoning would seem to\nalso rule out one case of inter-substantial causation which Leibniz\nallows, viz., God\u2019s concurrent causal action on finite simple\nsubstances.\n3. Language and Mind\n\nSome scholars have suggested that Leibniz should be regarded as one of\nthe first thinkers to envision something like the idea of artificial\nintelligence (cf. Churchland 1984; Pratt 1987). Whether or not he\nshould be regarded as such, it is clear that Leibniz, like\ncontemporary cognitive scientists, saw an intimate connection between\nthe form and content of language, and the operations of the mind.\nIndeed, according to his own testimony in the New Essays, he\n\u201creally believe[s] that languages are the best mirror of the\nhuman mind, and that a precise analysis of the signification of words\nwould tell us more than anything else about the operations of the\nunderstanding\u201d (bk.III, ch.7, sec.6 (RB, 333)). This view of\nLeibniz\u2019s led him to formulate a plan for a \u201cuniversal\nlanguage,\u201d an artificial language composed of symbols, which\nwould stand for concepts or ideas, and logical rules for their valid\nmanipulation. He believed that such a language would perfectly mirror\nthe processes of intelligible human reasoning. It is this plan that\nhas led some to believe that Leibniz came close to anticipating\nartificial intelligence. At any rate, Leibniz\u2019s writings about\nthis project (which, it should be noted, he never got the chance to\nactualize) reveal significant insights into his understanding of the\nnature of human reasoning. This understanding, it turns out, is not\nthat different from contemporary conceptions of the mind, as many of\nhis discussions bear considerable relevance to discussions in the\ncognitive sciences.\n\nAccording to Leibniz, natural language, despite its powerful resources\nfor communication, often makes reasoning obscure since it is an\nimperfect mirror of intelligible thoughts. As a result, it is often\ndifficult to reason with the apparatus of natural language,\n\u201csince it is full of innumerable equivocations\u201d (On\nthe Universal Science: Characteristic (undated); G VII, 205/S\n18). Perhaps this is because of his view that the terms of natural\nlanguage stand for complex, or derivative, concepts\u2014concepts\nwhich are composed of, and reducible to, simpler concepts. With this\n\u201ccombinatorial\u201d view of concepts in hand, Leibniz notices\n\u201cthat all human ideas can be resolved into a few as their\nprimitives\u201d (On the Universal Science: Characteristic;\nG VII, 205/S 18). We could then assign symbols, or\n\u201ccharacters,\u201d to these primitive concepts from which we\ncould form characters for derivative concepts by means of combinations\nof the symbols. As a result, Leibniz tells us, \u201cit would be\npossible to find correct definitions and values and, hence, also the\nproperties which are demonstrably implied in the definitions\u201d\n(On the Universal Science: Characteristic; G VII, 205/S 19).\nThe totality of these symbols would form a \u201cuniversal\ncharacteristic,\u201d an ideal language in which all human concepts\nwould be perfectly represented, and their constitutive nature\nperfectly transparent. Now it is true that Leibniz eventually came to\ndoubt \u201cwhether any concept of this [primitive] kind appears\ndistinctly to men, namely, in such a way that they know they have\nit\u201d (An Introduction to a Secret Encyclopedia (1679?);\nC 513/MP 7). But it is also clear that he did not see this skepticism\nconcerning our ability to reach the primitive concepts as much of a\nbarrier to the project of a universal language. He writes in The\nArt of Discovery (1685) that \u201cthere are certain primitive\nterms which can be posited, if not absolutely, at least relatively to\nus\u201d (C 176/W 51). The suggestion seems to be that even if we\ncannot provide a catalog of absolutely primitive concepts, we can\nnevertheless construct a characteristic based on concepts which cannot\nbe further resolved by humans.\n\nIn addition to the resolution of concepts, and their symbolic\nassignments, Leibniz envisages the formulation of logical rules for\nthe universal characteristic. He claims that \u201cit is plain that\nmen make use in reasoning of several axioms which are not yet quite\ncertain\u201d (The Method of Certitude and the Art of\nDiscovery (undated); G VII, 183/W 49). Yet with the explicit\nformulation of these rules for the logical manipulation of the\nsymbols\u2014rules which humans use in reasoning\u2014we would be in\npossession of a universal language which would mirror the relations\nbetween the concepts used in human reasoning. Indeed, the universal\ncharacteristic was intended by Leibniz as an instrument for the\neffective calculation of truths. Like formal logic systems, it would\nbe a language capable of representing valid reasoning patterns by\nmeans of the use of symbols. Unlike formal logic systems, however, the\nuniversal language would also express the content of human reasoning\nin addition to its formal structure. In Leibniz\u2019s mind,\n\u201cthis language will be the greatest instrument of reason,\u201d\nfor \u201cwhen there are disputes among persons, we can simply say:\nLet us calculate, without further ado, and see who is right\u201d\n(The Art of Discovery (1685); C 176/W 51).\n\nJudging from Leibniz\u2019s plans for a universal language, it is\nclear that Leibniz had a specific view about the nature of human\ncognitive processes, particularly about the nature of human reasoning.\nAccording to this view, cognition is essentially symbolic: it takes\nplace in a system of representations which possesses language-like\nstructure. Indeed, it was Leibniz\u2019s view that \u201call human\nreasoning uses certain signs or characters,\u201d (On the\nUniversal Science: Characteristic; G VII, 204/S 17) and \u201cif\nthere were no characters, we could neither think of anything\ndistinctly nor reason about it\u201d (Dialogue (1677); G\nVII, 191/A&G 271)). Add to this conception Leibniz\u2019s view\nthat human cognitive processes follow determinable axioms of logic,\nand the picture that emerges is one according to which the mind\noperates, at least when it comes to intelligible reasoning, by\nfollowing implicit algorithmic procedures. Regardless of whether or\nnot Leibniz should be seen as the grandfather of artificial\nintelligence, he did conceive of human cognition in essentially\ncomputational terms. In fact, as early as 1666, remarking favorably on\nHobbes\u2019 writings, Leibniz wrote: \u201cThomas Hobbes,\neverywhere a profound examiner of principles, rightly stated that\neverything done by our mind is a computation\u201d (On\nthe Art of Combinations (1666); G IV, 64/P 3).\n4. Perception and Appetition\n\nWhat do we find in the human mind? Representations on the one hand,\nand tendencies, inclinations, or strivings on the other, according to\nLeibniz. Or, to put this in Leibniz\u2019s more customary\nterminology, what is found within us is perception and appetition.\nHuman minds count for Leibniz as simple substances, and, as he says in\na letter to De Volder of 30 June 1704, \u201cit may be said that\nthere is nothing in the world except simple substances, and, in them,\nperception and appetite\u201d (G II, 270/A&G 181).\n\nPerception has already been discussed briefly above. But it will be\nadvisable to consider also a definition from a letter to Des Bosses\n(and echoed in many other passages) in which Leibniz discusses\nperception as the representation or \u201cexpression\u201d of\n\u201cthe many in the one\u201d (letter to Des Bosses, 11 July 1706;\nG II, 311). We shall return to this definition below. Appetitions are\nexplained as \u201ctendencies from one perception to another\u201d\n(Principles of Nature and Grace, sec.2 (1714); G VI,\n598/A&G 207). Thus, we represent the world in our perceptions, and\nthese representations are linked with an internal principle of\nactivity and change (Monadology, sec.15 (1714); G VI,\n609/A&G 215) which, in its expression in appetitions, urges us\never onward in the constantly changing flow of mental life. More\ntechnically explained, the principle of action, that is, the primitive\nforce which is our essence, expresses itself in momentary derivative\nforces involving two aspects: on the one hand, there is a\nrepresentative aspect (perception), by which the many without are\nexpressed within the one, the simple substance; on the other, there is\na dynamical aspect, a tendency or striving towards new perceptions,\nwhich inclines us to change our representative state, to move towards\nnew perceptions. (For more details, see Carlin 2004 and Jorati\n2017.)\n\nIt should not be inferred that this appetitive tendency to change is\nentirely governed by efficient causation only. For in Leibniz\u2019s\nview, value and final causes are not excluded from the action of the\nmind, the change of mental states. As he says in section 13 of the\nDiscourse on Metaphysics (1686), just as \u201cGod will\nalways do the best, \u2026 a man shall always do \u2026 that which\nappears to him to be the best\u201d (G IV, 438/A&G 46).\nAppearance, of course, has to do with perception; doing, with\nappetition. So this principle of human action applies directly, as one\nwould expect, to the two key factors of monadic interior life, only\nwith the role of value, or an end in view, now more clearly in focus.\nThis is why Leibniz says that, at the level of bodies (that is, for\nLeibniz, at the level of well-founded phenomena), all occurs according\nto the laws of efficient causes; whereas with respect to perceptions\nand appetites (or at least with some of these\u2014interpretations\ndiffer here) all occurs according to the laws of final causes. And\nalthough both types of causation can be found at both levels (cf.\nCarlin 2006), there is no clash here given the harmony of final and\nefficient causes in Leibniz\u2019s system.\n\nTo be sure, at an ultimate level, the only actions of substances\nare changes of perceptions. Thus, at the ultimate level, the\nappetitions are not so much the tendencies impelling a person towards\nvoluntary motions of the human body (although at the level of\nwell-founded phenomena this may indeed be the case) but rather\ntendencies arising out of present perceptions (present appearances)\ntowards new perceptions. This explains why Leibniz defines appetitions\nin the initially surprising way noted above, as \u201ctendencies from\none perception to another\u201d\u2014another\nperception, that is.\n\nThe last two paragraphs have helped to clarify appetition. It is time\nto return to perception. In Leibniz\u2019s definition (the expression\nof the many in the one) the two key terms are \u201cexpression\u201d\nand \u201cone.\u201d Both of them bear considerable weight in\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphysics. Representation or expression (Leibniz\nuses the two terms interchangeably) has its own definition: \u201cOne\nthing expresses another \u2026 when there is a constant and\nregulated relation between what can be said of the one and of the\nother\u201d (letter to Arnauld, 9 October 1687; G II, 112/LA 144).\nExamples, in addition to perception, include a map expressing or\nrepresenting a geographical region and an algebraic equation\nrepresenting or expressing a geometric figure, such as a circle or an\nellipse.\n\nAs we saw in the first section, with respect to oneness, Leibniz\nfamously claims that only something with true unity is truly real. For\nLeibniz, what truly is is substance, so it is not surprising\nthat at one point he clarifies his definition of perception by saying\nthat perception is \u201cthe expression of many things in one, or\nin simple substance\u201d (A New Method of Learning and\nTeaching Jurisprudence, revision notes of 1697\u20131700; A VI,\ni, 272/L 91).\n\nFinally, it should be recalled that for Leibniz there are quite\ndistinct levels of perception among created substances. Some of these\nwill be taken up in more detail in the following section, but the\nbasic point for now is that the three major levels, from the lowest to\nthe highest, are bare perception (without special distinctness or\nmemory), sensation (with heightened distinctness and memory), and\nthought (with distinctness, memory, and reflection). These are\ndistinctive of the three levels of monads, respectively, the bare\nmonads, souls, and spirits. Only the last of these may properly be\nsaid to have reason. Only the last of these is strictly a mind in the\nLeibnizian classification.\n5. Apperception, Desire and the Unconscious\n\nOne of the better-known terms of Leibniz\u2019s philosophy, and of\nhis philosophy of mind, is \u201capperception.\u201d A famous\ndefinition is presented in section 4 of the Principles of Nature\nand of Grace (1714), where Leibniz says that apperception is\n\u201cconsciousness, or the reflective knowledge of this\ninternal state.\u201d He adds that this is \u201csomething not given\nto all souls, nor at all times to a given soul\u201d (G VI,\n600/A&G 208).\n\nDespite being well known, Leibniz\u2019s concept of apperception is\nnot necessarily well understood. In particular, the place of\napperception in the three-fold classifications given at the end of the\nprevious section\u2014of three kinds of perceptions and of simple\nsubstances\u2014is not agreed upon, despite the fact that this would\nseem to be of considerable importance. (See Kulstad 1991a for\ndiscussion.) A common understanding is that for Leibniz apperception\nis distinctive of spirits and is not present in even the highest of\nanimals beneath humans. While there is evidence that Leibniz at least\nsometimes adopts this position, there is also evidence that he\nsometimes endorses the view that (at least some) beasts also\napperceive. Since we may assume that at a minimum apperception\ninvolves consciousness (though not necessarily certain higher forms of\nconsciousness, e.g., self-consciousness, or reflective consciousness,\nin one sense or another), this leads to some uncertainty as to whether\nLeibniz assigns consciousness to beasts, that is, whether he does or\ndoes not agree with the famous Cartesian principle that beasts are not\nconscious but only material automata.\n\nThere are at least three specific lines of evidence for apperception\nin beasts. The first is that Leibniz sometimes uses very similar\ndefinitions and examples when talking about the contrast between, on\nthe one hand, apperceptions and petites perceptions\n(perceptions which are not apperceived), and, on the other, sensation\nand bare perceptions. This suggests, though it does not demonstrate,\nthat Leibniz is identifying apperception and sensation, not\napperception and rational thought. The second line of evidence is that\nhe often appears to take the side of the common man against\nDescartes\u2019 position on beasts, for example, when he says,\n\nIt will be difficult to rid mankind of this opinion which has been\nheld always and everywhere and which is universal if any opinion\ndeserves that term, namely, that beasts have feelings (letter to\nArnauld, 9 October 1687; G II, 117/LA 150).\n\n\nFinally, there are passages, notably in the New Essays concerning\nHuman Understanding (1704), in which Leibniz quite simply\nascribes apperception, directly or indirectly, to beasts, as, for\nexample, when he discusses the case of a wild boar that has only a\nbare perception of a human until the human shouts at it, at which\npoint the boar apperceives the person\n(\u201cs\u2019apper\u00e7oit d\u2019une personne\u201d)\nand begins a charge (Bk.II ch.21, sec.5; A vi VI 173). \n\nWithout trying to proceed further with this issue here, we can see\nthat whichever of these views is ultimately adopted, it remains the\ncase that Leibniz\u2019s theory of perception involves something very\ndistinctive in an age dominated by Descartes\u2019 theory of ideas,\nthe thesis that there are some perceptions of which we are not\nconscious, the much-discussed petites perceptions. Although\nLeibniz may not have been the first to propose such an idea (Aquinas,\nfor example, might have had a similar view; see his Summa\nTheologiae, I-II, q.1, art.3), and although the view in his hands\ndid not have the explosive quality that it did in the hands of Freud,\nthe thesis remains an intriguing and important part of his philosophy\nof mind. Indeed, the Preface of the New Essays concerning Human\nUnderstanding contains as strong a statement as one is likely to\nfind about the centrality of this view in a particular metaphysical\nsystem. Among other things, Leibniz makes it very clear that it is not\njust lower simple substances that have such unconscious perceptions\nbut also human minds.\n\nHaving raised the issue of unconscious perceptions, we should consider\nalso the question of unconscious appetitions. This is infrequently\ndiscussed, but the question should not be overlooked. Since\nappetitions are tendencies or strivings, ones which profoundly\ninfluence human actions, it is relevant whether or not an individual\nhuman is conscious of all of these strivings. Certainly, some have\ntaken the possibility of urges of which we are not conscious as highly\nimportant for the proper understanding of individual humans and,\nindeed, of the human condition generally.\n\nThere is evidence, notably from the New Essays, that Leibniz\ndid indeed draw a parallel between perceptions and appetitions with\nrespect to consciousness. Although he did not always explain the\ndistinction between conscious and unconscious appetitions with care\nand uniformity, it seems clear that he committed himself to\nappetitions of which we are not conscious, or which we do not\napperceive, just as he had committed himself to perceptions which are\nnot apperceived. Consider the following two statements in combination:\n\u201cdesires and tendencies which are apperceived are often called\nvolitions\u201d (New Essays, Bk.II, ch.21, sec.39; RB 192);\nand, \u201cThere are also efforts that result from insensible\nperceptions which one does not apperceive, and these I prefer to call\nappetitions rather than volitions (although there are also\napperceptible appetitions)\u201d (New Essays, Bk.2, ch.21,\nsec.5; RB 173).\n\nIn short, and perhaps oversimplifying to a certain extent, we can say\nthat in the Leibnizian realm of mind there are indeed only perceptions\nand appetitions, but in these there is a fundamental divide between\nthe realm of consciousness and unconsciousness. In the former, there\nare apperceptions and desires, the perceptions and appetitions of\nwhich we are conscious. In the latter, there are perceptions and\nappetitions of which we are not conscious. That does not mean,\nhowever, that this latter realm is unimportant in our mental lives. As\nLeibniz says, \u201cinsensible perceptions are as important to [the\nscience of minds, souls, and soul-like substances] as insensible\ncorpuscles are to natural science, and it is just as unreasonable to\nreject the one as the other on the pretext that they are beyond the\nreach of our senses\u201d (New Essays, Preface; RB 56). He\nwould have said the same, no doubt, about inapperceptible\nappetitions.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"WorLei\">Works of Leibniz</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"WorLei\">Works of Leibniz</a>": "</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<table cellpadding=\"+3\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"><strong>A</strong></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><em>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: S\u00e4mtliche\nSchriften und Briefe</em>.
