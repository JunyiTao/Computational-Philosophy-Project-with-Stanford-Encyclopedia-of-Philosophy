    "main_text": "\n\n\nPerfectionism has acquired a number of meanings in contemporary\nmoral and political philosophy. The term is used to refer to an\naccount of a good human life, an account of human well-being, a moral\ntheory, and an approach to politics. Historically, perfectionism\nis associated with ethical theories that characterize the human good in\nterms of the development of human nature. Writers as diverse as\nAristotle, Aquinas, Spinoza, Marx, and T.H. Green are perfectionists in\nthis sense.\n\n\nSpeaking generally, perfectionist writers advance an objective\naccount of the good and then develop an account of ethics and/or\npolitics that is informed by this account of the good. Different\nperfectionist writers propose different accounts of the good and arrive\nat different ethical and political conclusions. But all\nperfectionists defend an account of the good that is objective in the\nsense that it identifies states of affairs, activities, and/or\nrelationships as good in themselves and not good in virtue of the fact\nthat they are desired or enjoyed by human beings.\n",
