    "main_text": "Compatibilism in Transition\n3. Compatibilism in Transition\n\nIn the 1960s, three major contributions to the free will debate\nradically altered it. One was an incompatibilist argument that put\ncrisply the intuition that a determined agent lacks control over\nalternatives. This argument, first developed by Carl Ginet, came to be\nknown as the Consequence Argument (Ginet 1966). Another\ncontribution was Harry Frankfurt\u2019s argument against the\nPrinciple of Alternative Possibilities (PAP), a principle\nstating that an agent is morally responsible for what she does only if\nshe can do otherwise (Frankfurt 1969). Finally, P.F. Strawson\ndefended compatibilism by inviting both compatibilists and\nincompatibilists to attend more carefully to the central role of\ninterpersonal relationships and the reactive attitudes in\nunderstanding the concept of moral responsibility (Strawson 1962).\nEach of these contributions changed dramatically the way that the free\nwill problem is addressed in contemporary discussions. No account of\nfree will, compatibilist or incompatibilist, is advanced today without\ntaking into account at least one (if not more) of these three\npieces.\n",
