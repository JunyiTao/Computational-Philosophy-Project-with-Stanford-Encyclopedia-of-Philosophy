    "main_text": "The Fregean Argument for Existence || From Existence to Mathematical Platonism?\n2.5 From Existence to Mathematical Platonism?\n\nSuppose we accept Existence, perhaps based on the\nFregean argument. As we have seen, this is not yet to accept\nmathematical platonism, which is the result of adding to\nExistence the two further claims\nAbstractness and Independence. Are\nthese two further claims defensible?\n\nBy the standards of philosophy, Abstractness has\nremained relatively uncontroversial. Among the few philosophers to\nhave challenged it are Maddy (1990) (concerning impure sets) and\nBigelow (1988) (concerning sets and various kinds of numbers). This\nrelative lack of controversy means that few explicit defenses of\nAbstractness have been developed. But it is not hard\nto see how such a defense might go. Here is one idea. It is a\nplausible prima facie constraint on any philosophical\ninterpretation of mathematical practice that it should avoid ascribing\nto mathematics any features that would render actual mathematical\npractice misguided or inadequate. This constraint makes it hard to\ndeny that the objects of pure mathematics are abstract. For if these\nobjects had spatiotemporal locations, then actual mathematical\npractice would be misguided and inadequate, since pure mathematicians\nought then to take an interest in the locations of their objects, just\nas zoologists take an interest in the locations of animals. The fact\nthat pure mathematicians take no interest in this question suggests\nthat their objects are abstract.\n\nIndependence says that mathematical objects, if there\nare any, are independent of intelligent agents and their language,\nthought, and practices. We will discuss what this thesis might amount\nto, and how it might be defended, in Section\n 4.\n",
