    "main_text": "Notions of Intrinsicality || Relational vs. Non-Relational Properties\n2.1 Relational vs. Non-Relational Properties\n\nMany writers, especially in the literature on intrinsic value, use\n\u2018relational\u2019 for the opposite of intrinsic. This seems to\nbe a mistake since many properties seem to be both be relational and\nintrinsic. For example, most people have the property having\nlonger legs than arms, and indeed seem to have this property in\nan intrinsic fashion, even though the property consists in a certain\nrelation being satisfied. Maybe the property is not intrinsic if\nwhether or not something is an arm or a leg is extrinsic, so perhaps\nthis isn\u2019t a conclusive example, but it seems troubling. And, in\nany case, there are other examples that can\u2019t be responded to in\nthis way. For example, the property of having a proper part is surely\nintrinsic, but it also appears to be a relational property.\n\nAs Humberstone 1996 notes, some might respond by suggesting that a\nrelational property is one such that if an object has it, then it\nbears some relation to a non-part of it. But this won\u2019t do\neither. Not being within a mile of a rhododendron is clearly\nrelational, but does not consist in bearing a relation to any\nnon-part, as we can see by the fact that a non-rhododendron all alone\nin a world can satisfy it.\n\nA further response might be to say that a relational property should\nbe a property that involves a relation that can only relate wholly\ndistinct things, and that, given this construal of a relational\nproperty, non-intrinsic properties are relational properties. However,\nthis response faces difficulties also. For example, this account would\npresumably classify the property of being such that there is a cube as\nbeing intrinsic. This property, however, is not intrinsic.\n\nWhile the notion of a relational property should be distinguished from\nthe notion of a non-intrinsic property, it might be that the notion of\nintrinsic properties can be given an account in terms of\nrelationality. One such account due to Francesscotti is discussed in\nthe supplement:\n\nThe Relational Account of Intrinsicality.\n \n",
