The University of Salamanca\n\nIn order to understand the theoretical aspects of the School of\nSalamanca, it is necessary to give a short introduction to the history\nof the University of Salamanca. The focus will then turn mostly to two\nDominicans, Francisco de Vitoria and Domingo de Soto, and two Jesuits,\nLuis de Molina and Francisco Su\u00e1rez, though there were, of\ncourse, many other extremely important participants in the various\nfields of discourse in which the School engaged.\n\nThe University of Salamanca is the oldest institution of higher\neducation on the Iberian Peninsula. A cathedral school, located in\nSalamanca by 1130, received a charter from King Alfonso IX of\nLe\u00f3n in 1218 as a \u201cgeneral school\u201d for his realm.\nThe regulations for this school were promulgated by King Alfonso X\n\u201cel Sabio\u201d in 1254. Pope Alexander IV, in 1255, confirmed\nthe foundation of the studium generale and conferred on it\nthe licentia ubique docendi, a universally valid license to\nteach. Thereafter, Salamanca was recognized as a university. Courses\nin theology and law were offered, with many graduates receiving\nemployment by the Iberian kingdoms. Lectures on authoritative texts\nwere the most common means of teaching. Starting in the fifteenth\ncentury, professors also offered relectiones, treating in\ngreater depth a particular topic previously covered during lectures.\nDisputations were also held. Christopher Columbus made his case for a\nsea route to Asia to the university before his voyage in 1492.\n\nTwo notable learned men, Juan de Segovia and Alfonso Tostado de\nMadrigal, were affiliated with the University of Salamanca in the\nfifteenth century. A short account of their careers will highlight the\nrange of views that characterized Spanish theology at the university\nin those years. Juan, a professor of theology (1422\u20131435),\nparticipated in the Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), beginning in\n1432. He defended conciliar supremacy and supported the doctrine of\nMary\u2019s Immaculate Conception. His writings include polemics on\nbehalf of the council against Pope Eugenius IV (1431\u20131447) and a\nHistory of the General Council of Basel. Juan was made a\ncardinal by the antipope Felix V (1439\u20131449); but he retired\nafter Felix yielded to Eugenius\u2019s successor, Nicholas V\n(1447\u20131455). In retirement, Juan wrote on the need for dialogue\nwith Islam. Aware of his impending death (c. 1458), Juan bequeathed\nhis library to the university.\n\nAlfonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Madrigal, \u201cel Tostado\u201d, taught\ntheology before becoming a bishop in 1454. He, too, supported the\nCouncil of Basel, and he displayed his knowledge in extensive writings\non Scripture and ecclesiastical history. His tract on the polity\ndefended popular regimes in a realm whose intellectuals usually\nembraced monarchy. Alfonso also wrote against clerical concubinage.\nCertain controversial opinions of his were denounced to both pope and\ncouncil. The Castilian Dominican Juan de Torquemada wrote a critique\nof Alfonso\u2019s views, to which he replied. Alfonso later defended\nhis teachings in Rome before Pope Eugenius. \u201cEl Tostado\u201d,\non his death, left behind a reputation for great learning. (Torquemada\nalso set a precedent for ranking theological errors, most of them less\nthan heresy. The rankings given by the Spanish Scholastics set the\nstage for inquisitorial inquiries into lesser errors [Vega 2022:\n92]).\n\nThe Dominican order had established itself in Salamanca by 1244, when\na provincial chapter was held in that city. The convent of San\nEsteban, chosen as the site of a studium generale of the\norder in 1299, offered courses in grammar, logic and theology. During\nthe fourteenth century, the Dominican convent gained control of two of\nthe university\u2019s four chairs of theology. In 1489,\nSalamanca\u2019s Dominican studium received from the papacy\nthe right to award academic degrees. The building now associated with\nVitoria and his school was begun in 1524 but not finished until 1610,\nwhen the university was falling into decline. By that date, other\nIberian universities, especially Alcal\u00e1 and Coimbra, had become\ncompetitors of Salamanca for intellectual leadership. (Alcal\u00e0\nexcelled in the study of biblical texts [Bentley 1983].) In addition,\nthe Jesuits became competitors of the Dominicans as leading\nphilosophers and theologians. In Vitoria\u2019s century,\ndistinguished scholars at Salamanca included the jurist Mart\u00edn\nde Azpilcueta, who is known for developing a monetarist theory, and\nthe Scripture professor Gregorio Gallo, who considered the possibility\nthat the Apostle Thomas had preached in the New World. The role of the\nFranciscans in the same period, including their advocacy of the\ndoctrine of the Immaculate Conception, requires further research (Lynn\n2022; Izbicki 2022; Broggio 2002; all in Tubau ed. 2022).\n2. Francisco de Vitoria and His Disciples\n\nFrancisco de Vitoria (1486\u20131546) is usually regarded as a late\nScholastic, who employed Aristotelian thought in his philosophy and\ntheology. Although Spanish Scholastics like Vitoria were primarily\ntheologians, the topics they discussed went far beyond the limits of\ntheology and even of the traditional philosophical companions of\ntheology, such as metaphysics and logic. This is partly because\nDominican theologians had to comment on the Summa theologiae\nof Thomas Aquinas, with all the different topics it covered. The\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries saw a revival of Thomism in Paris,\nRome and Salamanca. In Rome, Thomas de Vio (Cajetan) wrote the most\ninfluential commentary on the Summa theologiae. In Paris,\nPeter Crockaert, a pupil of John Mair, joined the Dominican order and\nbecame a zealous Thomist. Francisco de Vitoria, who studied in Paris,\nembraced this Thomist revival. When he began teaching in Salamanca in\n1524, he supplemented Peter Lombard\u2019s Sentences with\nthe Summa theologiae as a textbook for the study of theology.\nAlthough the University of Salamanca was not a new foundation, Vitoria\nand his disciples, especially Domingo de Soto (1494\u20131560) and\nMelchor Cano (1509\u20131560), transformed it into a center for a\nrevived Scholasticism, applying Thomism to such practical problems as\nthe evangelization of the indigenous populations of the New World and\nthe legality of slavery. In addition, the Dominicans of Castile\ninfluenced the intellectual development of the fledgling Jesuit order,\nwhich produced such luminaries as Luis de Molina (1535\u20131600) and\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez (1548\u20131617).\n\nSome works of these theologians can be seen as vast, overflowing\ncommentaries on a number of questions from the Summa\ntheologiae, especially on topics such as law and justice. Since\nthey were confronted by a rapidly changing universe\u2014a so-called\nNew World, populated by inhabitants who belonged to none of the\ntraditionally known religions, and a globalizing economy (including\nthe slave trade)\u2014they had to deal with new opportunities and new\nproblems, while still considering long-standing questions such as the\nlegitimacy of charging interest. Because they were understood, or\nunderstood themselves, as confessors or as advisors of\nconfessors\u2014Domingo de Soto was Emperor Charles V\u2019s\nconfessor, Luis de Molina declared that he wrote for the confessors of\nthose who hold power\u2014they had to cope with political, economic\nand legal reality, often in a quite detailed manner.\n\nThe authors of the School of Salamanca used traditional tools to deal\nwith the new situations they faced. Besides the overarching influence\nof Thomas Aquinas\u2014who became a Doctor of the Church in 1567 and\nwhose works Ignatius of Loyola had obliged the members of his newly\nfounded Jesuit order to study diligently\u2014they engaged with other\nmedieval traditions, including the glosses to the Decretum\nGratiani (Gratian), Franciscan authors (especially John Duns\nScotus and William of Ockham), Jean Gerson and even Marsilius of\nPadua, a banned author who was not even allowed to be cited, but\nnevertheless had a considerable impact on the conciliarist debate.\nScholastic authors made a creative, instead of philologically correct,\nuse of their authorities, interpreting and explaining them in their\nown sense. Molina and Su\u00e1rez even overtly criticized Thomas\nAquinas and his understanding of law.\n\nVitoria\u2019s thought inevitably depended\u2014but not\nslavishly\u2014on Thomas Aquinas, not only in his commentary on the\nSumma theologiae, but also in his relectiones and\nother writings on law and society. His admiration for \u201cDivus\nThomas\u201d had already begun when he studied and later taught\ntheology at Paris and Valladolid. At Paris, he had assisted in the\npreparation of Crockaert\u2019s edition of the Summa\ntheologiae, published in 1515. His lectures commenting on the\nPrima and the Prima secundae of the Summa\nare lost, but must have been quite successful. His most famous works\nwere published after he was elected to the first chair of theology,\nthe most important professorship in the Spanish kingdom, at the\nUniversity of Salamanca in 1526; and, contrary to the statutes of the\nuniversity, he took the Summa theologiae as the basis for his\nteachings (Vitoria, Vorlesungen 1995, 36). His reflections on\npolitical topics, such as the political status of the Church and the\nConquista in Mexico and South America, were followed\nattentively in the highest circles, even if not always approved, as\nEmperor Charles V\u2019s harsh reaction to Vitoria\u2019s lecture\nDe Indis showed.\n\nVitoria\u2019s health became precarious in the 1540s, and the\ndominant role at Salamanca passed to his disciples. The most important\nof these was Domingo de Soto, who was born in Segovia 1494 of humble\norigins, studied in Alcal\u00e1 and Paris, entered the Dominican\norder before he was thirty and was appointed to the second chair of\ntheology, the Catedra de visperas, at the University of\nSalamanca in 1532. Later he became the prior of the Convent of San\nEsteban in Salamanca and was from 1548\u20131550 confessor to Charles\nV. After this, he returned to the university, where he held the first\nchair of theology. He died at San Esteban in 1560. Together with\nMelchor Cano, another important disciple of Vitoria, who later became\nbishop of the Canary Islands, he participated in the Council of Trent\n(1545\u20131563) by order of Spain\u2019s privy council. Soto,\nalthough without a vote in the council, urged bishops to attend to the\nwork of preaching; and he defended Scholastic theology against\nproposals to suppress it. Before returning to Spain, Soto helped with\nthe preparations for Charles V\u2019s Augsburg Interim (1548), which\nmade concessions to the Protestants. One result of Soto\u2019s\npresence at Trent was his tract De natura et gratia, which\nfocused on the errors of Martin Luther, whose writings he called\n\u201cdiabolic\u201d (Soto, De iustitia et iure VII, qu. 5\nad. 4; Grimm 2017: 64). In addition, he wrote an Apologia\nagainst a fellow Dominican, Ambrosius Catharinus Politus, concerning\nthe certitude of grace.\n\nMelchor Cano was less involved in controversy at Trent, concentrating\ninstead on issues of preaching and sacramental theology; however,\nanother Dominican present at the council, Bartolom\u00e9 Carranza\n(1503\u20131576), the future archbishop of Toledo, participated in\nthe discussion of justification, arguing for \u201ctwofold\njustification\u201d. Carranza was reported to be reading\nLuther\u2019s works, a sign of future troubles in which his\nCommentary on the Christian Catechism was criticized by both\nCano and Soto. Eventually, Carranza was condemned by the Inquisition\nfor his views on nature and grace and underwent a long imprisonment,\ndespite Soto\u2019s efforts to defend him with a more balanced\nopinion, which Carranza cited in his own defense (Tellechea\n1962\u20132012).\n\nVitoria and his disciples engaged in arguments over Spain\u2019s\nrights in the New World. The debate began when the Dominicans in the\nAntilles criticized the conquerors\u2019 treatment of indigenous\npeoples. In a sermon given by the Dominican friar Antonio de\nMontesinos on December 21, the fourth Sunday of Advent 1511, in\nHispaniola (today\u2019s Haiti and Dominican Republic), the Spaniards\nwho attended were told that they lived and died in mortal sin because\nof the cruelties they had inflicted upon the Amerindians. One of his\nlisteners was Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas (1474\u20131566), who\njoined the Dominican order and was converted by Montesinos into the\nmost severe critic of the Conquista (Las Casas, Historia\nde las Indias).\n\nA Junta of Burgos (1513) declared that Charles V had a sound title to\nthe Indies. One argument in that context, grounded in\nAristotle\u2019s thought, was that the Amerindians were slaves by\nnature. This view did not remain uncontested; and, eventually, on 2\nJune 1537, Pope Paul III, influenced by Las Casas, issued the bull\nSublimis Deus, declaring the indigenous peoples to be fully\nhuman with souls and just title to their possessions. The ongoing\ndebate climaxed in the disputation between Las Casas, defending the\nliberty of the indigenous populations, and the humanist Aristotelian\nJuan Gin\u00e9s de Sep\u00falveda (1494\u20131573), who defended\nthe Spanish title to the Indies because of the Amerindian\u2019s sins\nand because they were slaves by nature. This took place in the Junta\nof Valladolid (1550/51), which Charles V had assembled with a number\nof other leading scholars on both sides.\n3. The Role of the Jesuits\n\nAfter the deaths of Domingo de Soto and Melchor Cano, the reputation\nof Salamanca\u2019s Dominicans declined. Domingo Ba\u00f1ez\n(1528\u20131604), a pupil of Cano, is the best known of their\nsuccessors. When his commentary on Thomas\u2019s Summa\nappeared (1584), admitting of no dissent from its doctrines, it\nprovoked a controversy over the theology of grace and free will.\nBa\u00f1ez\u2014also the confessor of St. Theresa of\nAvila\u2014was opposed by the Jesuit Luis de Molina, who accused him\nof being overly deterministic.\n\nMolina was born in Cuenca (Spain) in 1535, entered the Jesuit order at\nthe age of 18, studied in Salamanca and Coimbra, taught theology in\n\u00c9vora (Portugal) from 1568 to 1583 and later in Lisbon. In 1591\nhe was sent to the Jesuit college of his home town of Cuenca and was\nelected in 1600 to the chair of moral theology at the Jesuit College\nin Madrid, where he died in the same year. In 1588 Molina published a\nvolume entitled Liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina\npraescientia, providentia, praedestinatione et reprobatione\nconcordia, usually abbreviated as Concordia, in which he\ntried to reconcile free will with grace, God\u2019s pre-knowledge,\nprovidence, etc. It produced a devastating effect (see below and\nMacGregor 2015), a passionate debate between Dominicans and Jesuits,\nraising accusations of both Pelagian and Calvinist heresy, both of\nwhich were extremely dangerous for Catholic theologians. This\ncontroversy continued until a congregation De auxiliis\nmeeting in Rome under Paul V decreed (1607) that Dominicans and\nJesuits could hold their own opinions on efficacious grace. The\nconflict did not end, however, and in 1611 the Roman Inquisition\nforbade the publication of any further books on the topic\u2014the\nmost drastic case of ecclesiastical censorship of theologians in the\nseventeenth century (Knebel 2000: 170).\n\nIn general, the Jesuits felt less bound than Dominicans to the\nopinions of Thomas Aquinas, which meant that Molina and Su\u00e1rez\nwere allowed a greater degree of originality in their teachings. For\nthis reason, some modern scholars emphasize the differences between\nthe Dominican School of Salamanca and the Jesuit School of Coimbra,\nwhich came after it, though both belong to the broad tradition of\nSpanish Scholasticism.\n\nSu\u00e1rez was a student at Salamanca in 1561, when he joined the\nSociety of Jesus. He was an educator, settling eventually in Coimbra,\nwhere he produced a tract De legibus ac Deo legislatore\n(1612). As a polemicist, he intervened in the quarrel over the oath of\nallegiance imposed by James I on English Catholics after the Gunpowder\nPlot (1605). Su\u00e1rez and his Jesuit contemporary Robert\nBellarmine were the most important Catholic writers on political and\necclesiological issues following the Council of Trent.\n\nWith the death of Su\u00e1rez, the School of Salamanca and its\noffshoots lost their creative edge. Instead, there was an urge to\nrecapitulation. The Discalced Carmelites produced an enormous\ncompilation of past thought, the Cursus Theologiae Moralis;\nand the publication of its third volume in 1670 is often treated as\nmarking the end of the School of Salamanca.\n4. Theology and Church Law\n\nA common theological topic for the authors of the School of Salamanca\nwas the need to resist what they considered to be Lutheran heresies\n(Skinner 1978: 135\u2013173). They suspected, for instance, that\nconnecting legal authority to the virtue of princes could\n\u201cinveigle away the hearts of simple men from due obedience to\ntheir princes and their priests\u201d, as Vitoria put it (De\npotestate ecclesiastica I qu. 1, art. 2; transl. Vitoria 1991b:\n55); and they regarded as heretical the view that grace is not\nincreased directly by the sacraments ex opere operato but\nrequires the faith of the recipient (Vitoria, De potestate\necclesiastica I qu. 2, art. 2). Other points at issue were\nwhether all Christians could be seen as priests (ibid., II qu. 2, art.\n1), the role of papacy, the veneration of the Virgin Mary and the\ncentral problem of free will, which was denied by Luther. As we shall\nsee, the problem of free will and grace also gave rise to an extremely\nbitter and long-lasting controversy between Dominicans and Jesuits\ninside Catholicism after the Council of Trent, which had avoided the\nissue except to reject Protestant theologies.\n\nVitoria\u2019s awareness of the challenge of Luther to Catholicism\naffected his teaching and that of his successors. In his\nRelectiones de potestate ecclesiastica (1532\u20131533) and\nRelectio de potestate papae et concilii (1534), he was\ncritical of the Roman curia, especially on account of its free-handed\ndistribution of dispensations; but he was careful not to open the way\nfor any assault on the papacy and Catholic orthodoxy.\n\nVitoria\u2019s basic ecclesiology was traditional, identifying the\necclesia as the \u201ccongregation of the faithful\u201d.\nWhen heretics left this community, they did so like deserters from an\narmy. The Church received its power from Christ, which was distinct\nfrom that of lay regimes, in order to promote good and resist evil.\nThe priesthood of the New Law superseded that of the Old Law. The\nChurch\u2019s power had two aspects: orders and jurisdiction. Orders\ninvolved the sacraments, especially the eucharist and penance.\nJurisdiction included spiritual censures inflicted on erring\nbelievers. By divine command, the Church was a \u201cperfect\u201d\ncommunity, that is, one which was able to defend itself and punish\niniquity.\n\nChrist established the papacy to look after the Church\u2019s\nwelfare. Priests administered the sacraments under the supervision of\nthe pope and the bishops. Orders came via the apostles but\njurisdiction via Peter, Christ\u2019s vicar. It was the\nresponsibility of his successors, the popes, to build up the Church.\nBishops legislated for their diocese or province, but the pope acted\nfor the whole Church. Vitoria expressed great respect for general\ncouncils as gatherings of bishops, but he maintained that a council\ndid not have power superior to that of the pope. Moreover, after\nconsidering the councils of the fifteenth century, which had resolved\nthe Great Western Schism (1378\u20131417), he denied conciliarism in\nits dogmatic form. The most ancient councils had not claimed that\nsupreme power was invested in the Church (Izbicki 2019).\n\nSpiritual power was superior to temporal, but that did not make the\npope lord of the world. Papal power could have an impact on Christian\nregimes, making and unmaking rulers, but only for spiritual ends. The\npontiff could authorize just wars against the Saracens and other\nenemies of the faith. The ecclesiastical commonwealth had its powers\nfrom grace, but grace did not cancel nature. To the contrary:\nAccording to Aquinas \u201cgrace presupposes nature and perfects\nit\u201d (Gratia praesupponit naturam et perficit eam, ST I\nqu. I art. 8 ad 2).\n\nThe topic of grace and free will was the main ingredient of the\ncontroversy over Molinism. It began with the work of Molina mentioned\nabove, Liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina praescientia,\nprovidentia, praedestinatione et reprobatione concordia (Molina\nConcordia). In it he explains how God can preserve his\nomnipotence, providence and pre-knowledge, while conceding free will\nto humans, by means of his scientia media, or \u201cmiddle\nknowledge\u201d, which gives him the ability to know what human\nbeings will decide\u2014but no control over their decisions.\nScientia media is placed between scientia naturalis,\nby which God knows everything that can be, and scientia\nlibera, by which he knows what will be. Molina places God\u2019s\ncounterfactual knowledge before the creation\u2014contrary to Luther\nand Calvin. God\u2019s omnipotence consists in the possibility that\nhe could have created beings without the capacity to accept or reject\nthe offer of grace by their will (Concordia pars IV, disp.\n52). Furthermore, humans are able by their free will, without the\nspecial help of God (sine auxilio speciali Dei;\nConcordia pars I, disp. 5 [1953: 29]), but only with his\nconcursus generale, to act morally in a temporal sense.\nHowever, they need grace within temporal life and God\u2019s special\nhelp for the effort to receive eternal grace, i.e., the visio\nbeatifica, the vision of God of the blessed after their death. In\nthe ensuing controversy, known as De auxiliis, fierce\ncriticisms came from the Dominican Domingo Ba\u00f1ez, who had the\nfirst chair of theology at Salamanca, and his pupils; they held a\nspecial Thomist theory of grace, which referred to the\npraedeterminatio physica, mankind\u2019s inability to resist\nGod\u2019s grace.\n\nIt is easy to forget that Su\u00e1rez was concerned not only with\nmetaphysics and law; but he has also been described as the founder of\nMariology on account of his treatment of the Immaculate Conception and\nMary\u2019s bodily assumption. Su\u00e1rez took a balanced view of\nthe issues of divine foreknowledge, free will and predestination in\nthe De auxiliis controversy; and, building on Molina, he\ndeveloped the doctrine of Congruism, which argued that God had\narranged matters to allow free will to assent to grace. He also\ndiscussed how God rewards the good and punishes sinners.\n\nSu\u00e1rez was a confirmed papalist, who regarded the Holy See as\nnecessary to the Church\u2019s unity. Canon law existed as a distinct\naspect of human law, supporting humanity\u2019s higher ends and\nunifying all peoples. The pope was divinely guided in pronouncements\non doctrine, and he had a universal responsibility to spread the\ngospel. Su\u00e1rez, however, refused to accept evangelization as an\nexcuse for war. Not even unnatural acts justified the use of violence.\nConsequently, Su\u00e1rez, like Vitoria and Soto, upheld the\nlegitimacy of non-Christian regimes operating within the bounds of\nnatural law.\n5. Natural Law, Political Theory and the Rise of International Law\n5.1 Natural Law\n\nOne of the generally acknowledged merits of the School of Salamanca\nwas the revival of natural law or at least its Thomist version. This\nwas more or less closely connected to commentaries on the second part\nof Thomas Aquinas\u2019s Summa theologiae. Vitoria\u2019s\nlectures on the quaestiones 90\u2013105 of the Prima\nsecundae, entitled De lege, dealing with the different\nkinds of law, and his voluminous commentary on the Secunda\nsecundae are now available in critical editions by Vicente\nBeltr\u00e1n de Heredia. Molina described his monumental De\niustitia et iure, which in current forms of printing would take\nup around 6,000 pages, as a commentary on quaestiones\n57\u201379 in the Secunda secundae, but he admitted that he\nwas not following Thomas precisely and that his theory covered a wider\nrange compared to what had been discussed by \u201cDivus\nThomas\u201d. Whether the ten volumes of Su\u00e1rez\u2019s De\nlegibus ac Deo legislatore are primarily to be seen as a\ncommentary on quaestiones 90\u2013108 of the Prima\nsecundae is still debated by modern scholars. Soto, who is\nmentioned by Su\u00e1rez as one of his main sources besides Thomas\nAquinas, commented on questions from both the Prima secundae\nand Secunda secundae in the ten books of his extremely\ninfluential treatise De iustitia et iure. The common\nbackground for all the authors of the School of Salamanca, as well as\ntheir Jesuit successors, who dealt with law, natural law and justice\nwas, therefore, Thomas Aquinas\u2019s division of the different kinds\nof law in the Prima secundae and his reflections on the\ndifferent meanings of justice, law and right from the Secunda\nsecundae, whether they followed him or not.\n\nThe classification of laws in the Summa (Ia IIae, qu.\n91\u20134) begins with God\u2019s regulation of the universe via the\neternal law, manifest to humans through revealed divine law and\nthrough natural law, which was accessible by reason. Humans, even\nthose lacking revelation, could derive from natural law the principles\nfor enacting human law. Human law, inevitably, had to be adapted to\ntime, place and climate and was, therefore, limited. Nor was reason\nable to craft laws covering all contingencies. They had to be useful\nto the commonwealth and also mutable if circumstances changed.\nDispensations were required where a law did not apply in a particular\ncase. Disobeying laws was a vice, while obeying them was a virtue.\nDivine law, embodied in the Old Law or the New Law, which regulated\ncontingent elements of religious cult, but also the punishment of\nthose who had escaped human justice, was in accordance with natural\nlaw and eternal law. Human laws were invalid if they contradicted\neither divine or natural law. In the quaestiones 57\u201379\nof the Secunda secundae, Thomas addressed questions such as\n\u201cWhether right is the object of justice\u201d, and \u201cWhat\nis justice?\u201d; he also discussed judgment, kinds of justice,\nrestitution, injustice, kinds of injustice and so on.\n\nVitoria followed this schema in his lectures on the Summa\ntheologiae, especially in his 1533\u20131534 lectures and in his\ncommentary. He treated law as made by \u201creason and\nenlightenment\u201d, not just the will. Natural law, derived from\neternal law by reason, was binding on all humanity; its principles\napplied to mutable situations and different peoples. God was the\nindirect cause of human laws, which were binding on the consciences of\nindividuals. There was a human urge to obey natural law, for example,\nby honoring one\u2019s parents, preferably out of love. Failure to\nheed these precepts was a moral fault.\n\nThe gospel was valid when promulgated by Christ, but barbarians\nignorant of the gospel might violate its commands in a pardonable way.\nThe Church had general laws which were applicable anywhere, and\nfailure to obey them was sinful. Human legislators could enact laws\nfavoring religion, but they must not confuse their role with that of\nthe clergy under divine law.\n\nHuman laws were intended to serve the common good, not the interests\nof the legislator, who was \u201cthe servant of the\ncommonwealth\u201d. Any \u201cperfect\u201d community, sacred or\nsecular, had the power to make and enforce laws. Human laws were\nbinding once publicly promulgated; but the Church had its laws from\nGod. The Church had one ruler on earth, the pope, the vicar of Christ,\njust as the universe was ruled by God; but, like other rulers, the\nRoman pontiff delegated power for its effective exercise.\n\nDespite the preeminent place that Thomas Aquinas occupied for these\nauthors, there are significant deviations from the Thomist concept of\nnatural law that are shared by some of them, who at times also\ndirectly criticized the \u201cDoctor Angelicus\u201d. Su\u00e1rez,\nfor instance, says that law has to be seen as something that rules the\nbehavior of beings capable of free decisions (De legibus I\niii 2); therefore, Thomas\u2019s concept of an eternal law that rules\nthe whole universe can be understood as a law only in a metaphorical\nsense. There are still ongoing debates as to whether eternal law can\nbe seen as the theological basis of all other kinds of law\n(Schweigh\u00f6fer 2018: 234\u2013256). Natural law, for Thomas, on\nthe one hand, is known to humans because of their participation as\nrational beings in eternal law, but, on the other, it is at least\npartially shared with animals (Summa theologiae Ia IIae qu.\n95 art. 4 ad 1; IIa IIae quaestio 57 art. 3 co) in parallel\nto Roman Law (Digest 1.1.1.4). Its role for Thomas was labeled as\nsomething like a \u201cstyle\u201d, i.e., a universal principle\n(Westerman 1998: 81) governing animate nature. For Su\u00e1rez it\nbecomes a device to rule the behavior of humans as rational beings who\nare responsible for their activities. It not only contains the most\ngeneral principles of law, leaving the more detailed regulations to\nhuman law, but also everything that follows logically from these\nprinciples; otherwise not even the ten commandments would belong to\nnatural law. According to Su\u00e1rez, natural law is the voice of\nright reason which effects human behavior via man\u2019s conscience,\nand \n\n\na man who is led by this law is said to be his own law, because he has\nthe law written within himself\n\ndicitur homo, qui illo ducitur, sibi lex, quia habet in se\nscriptam legem. (De legibus II v 9\u201310) \n\n\nThis conceptual shift was initiated at least implicitly by Vitoria in\nhis commentary on quaestio 57. Thomas gives as an example of\nwhat is just by nature in an absolute sense the natural inclination of\nthe male to the female for the sake of procreation and the efforts of\nparents to nurture their children. Vitoria replaces these examples by\nthe obligation to return deposits and the Golden Rule. This\nmoralization of natural law is not found in all the authors under\nconsideration. Molina, for example, argues that someone who uses the\nextreme poverty of another to make that person his slave, instead of\nproviding help without imposing conditions, commits a sin against\ncharity; but the contract is valid according to natural law (De\niustitia et iure II, disp. 34).\n\nThe Salamancan theologians and their successors not only discussed and\nmodified Thomist natural law but also referred to other sources with\nslightly different categorizations, such as the distinction between\nius humanum and ius naturale vel divinum made by\nIsidore of Seville (Liber etymologiarum, lib. 5 c.\n2\u201318), cited in Decretum Gratiani (Gratian [1879: vol.\n1, 1\u20135]) and discussed by Soto (De iustitia et iure I,\nqu. V, art. iii and iv). There were many further differences among\nthem on natural law, as on law in general. For instance, with regard\nto whether law was an act of will or an act of intellect, some, like\nSoto, favored the intellect despite his early education in\nNominalist-dominated Paris, where voluntarism, an emphasis on the will\nover the intellect, prevailed; others, like Su\u00e1rez, gave some\nrelevance to the will. Nevertheless, they were in agreement that the\nprinciples of natural law were inscribed in the hearts of humans, so\nthat \u201cno human being can plead ignorance as an excuse\u201d, as\nSoto put it (De iustitia et iure, I qu. I art. iv; transl.\nHamilton 1963: 15). Su\u00e1rez\u2019s concept of law has been\ndescribed as voluntarist, but reason still played a significant role\nin his thought. Reason diagnosed situations, identifying possible\nremedies; but the will implemented these measures. These deliberations\nhappened within the context of immutable natural law, which\nSu\u00e1rez believed was known through specific precepts. In\naddition, he held that individual virtue lay in following right\nreason. Reason\u2019s dictates were unique to human beings, not\nimpulses shared with animals. The laws common to many peoples, though\nnot universal, made up the ius gentium. What may seem at\nfirst glance an acknowledgement of the moral competence of all human\nbeings was also used to justify punishment, including war and\nenslavement, against peoples from other continents.\n\nIt is the ius gentium, not natural law, that regulates the\ndistribution of property and the enslavement of human beings. The\nimmutable natural law, however, gives permission for these activities,\nbecause, after the Fall, the circumstances of its application changed\ndramatically, making an enforced regulation of possession necessary\n(see, e.g., Su\u00e1rez, De legibus L I xvi 7). Although\nproperty\u2014or dominium as it was called\u2014is not part\nof human nature, according to the majority of Salamancan thinkers and\ntheir followers, there are many reflections by different authors\narguing for the advantages of private property. Soto and Molina make\ndirect use of Aristotelian and Thomist arguments, saying that common\nownership would prevent men from working and from taking care of their\nthings to the disadvantage of the common good (Soto, De iustitia\net iure, IV art. 3; Molina, De iustitia et iure, II 19;\nsee Chafuen 2003: 3\u201338). There are differences concerning the\nway in which dominium in this sense is bound by regulations\nfrom positive and natural law. Most authors, such as Vitoria, in his\ncommentary on quaestio 66 in the Secunda secundae of\nthe Summa theologiae, accepted the Thomist view that those in\nextreme need are entitled to take what is necessary for their\nsurvival. Martin de Azpilcueta (1491\u20131586), known as\n\u201cDoctor Navarrus\u201d or \u201cNavarro\u201d, however, held\nthat there is no obligation to donate to those who are in extreme need\nand that anyone who receives such a donation must see it as a loan,\nnot as something of his own (Chafuen 2003: 44).\n\nSome of these theologians adopted an understanding of the word\nius in the sense of right, even subjective right. This is not\na Salamancan invention but seems to have been initiated in the glosses\nto the Decretum Gratiani and enforced by authors like Ockham\nand Gerson (Tierney 1997). But it plays an important role in arguments\non dominium\u2014a term that oscillates between domination\nand property\u2014and in reflections on the ius gentium. The\nfirst lecture of Vitoria\u2019s De Indis deals with the\nquestion of whether the Indians may be called veri domini,\nthat is, real masters or real possessors, of their goods, and the\nthird lecture claims that they violated the rights of the Spaniards.\nMolina takes this subjective meaning of ius as the\nparadigmatic understanding of the term throughout his voluminous\ntreatise De iustitia et iure. He defines ius as \n\n\na faculty to do or have something or to maintain it or to behave in\nany way such that if it is hindered without legitimate reason an\ninjury is done to the person who has it. This way, that right, in this\nmeaning, becomes something like a measure of injury: because as much\nas it is opposed and damaged without legitimate reason, injury is done\nto the one who has it. (De iustitia et iure II 1) \n\n\nThough it may be exaggerated to call the School of Salamanca the\ncradle of human rights, individual rights are pivotal for a number of\ntheir arguments. Molina states that a slave may have a ius qua\nhomo, even in the special case of a right to things he has won\nfrom his master in gambling and suchlike. Furthermore, he declares\nthat an injustice toward someone is a violation of that person\u2019s\nrights, and he gives a number of examples where injustice is done\ntoward a slave and must be corrected or punished. We may, therefore,\nconclude that slaves also have rights in his system (De iustitia\net iure II 38).\n\nThe issue of slavery in the New World cannot be divorced from racial\nconcerns. African slaves were imported. Also, Spaniards and indigenous\npeoples intermarried with each other and with black slaves.\nClassifications were developed to designate various mixtures. It is\nnotable that these mixed populations received marital privileges the\npapacy issued for converts in the New World. However, ideas of infamy\narose, describing mixed populations with language indicating\ninferiority. Also, this language indicated levels of mixture with\nindigenous populations by proportions as small as one sixteenth. (R.\nHill 2022: 585\u2013611). The discrimination of Africans as a\n\u201cjustification\u201d of enslavement began even before the\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d of America, using, among others, the biblical\nreference to Noah\u2019s curse Genesis 9:20\u201327. However, the\nconcept of race in the modern sense was developed from eighteenth\ncentury onwards, while earlier writers used the term\n\u201cnations\u201d to speak about Africans and Amerindigenous\npeoples who were allegedly \u201clike beasts\u201d and determined to\nserve (Haar & Kaufmann 2023: Kap. 4 and below).\n5.2 Political Theory\n\nThe central topics in the political theory of authors from the School\nof Salamanca are the aim of political community, the legitimacy of its\npower and the relationship between the commonwealth and its ruler.\n\nIn his lecture On Civil Power (De potestate civili),\nVitoria holds that every power, public or private, comes from God and\ncannot be abolished by human beings, not even if they are in full\nconsensus. Vitoria\u2019s ideas about society depended partly on his\nAristotelian belief that human beings are social by nature, needing\nothers to survive and achieve a good life. Thus, a natural good,\nsurvival, not moral goodness, was its original purpose. Nature,\nfollowing God\u2019s purpose, had implanted in early peoples the urge\nto establish households, cities and regimes. Society eventually came\nto promote virtues, especially justice and amity, which supported the\ncommon good. He followed in a certain sense an Aristotelian line,\nusing the theory of the four causes for his analysis, first of public,\nthen of private power, and starting with the final cause, which was\nregarded in the Aristotelian and Thomist tradition as the necessary\ncause. According to Vitoria, \n\n\nthe origin of human cities and commonwealths was not a human invention\n\u2026 but a device implanted by nature in man for his own survival\n\n\n\nand for the sake of this it also needs an \u201cordering force\u201d\n(ibid., qu. 1, art. 2, p. 9). The efficient cause of public power is\nGod, and its material cause is the commonwealth itself. Royal power is\nnot from the commonwealth, even if the king is elected, but from God\nhimself (ibid., qu. 1 art. 5). Non-Christians have legitimate rulers,\nand a legitimately constituted power cannot be abolished by the\nconsent of the people (ibid., qu.1. art 6\u20137).\n\nAll peoples created regimes: since a multitude could not govern itself\nwell, power was entrusted to a group or individual acting for the\ncommon good. The best regime, in Vitoria\u2019s opinion, was rule by\none person, who was both above the community and within it.\nIndividuals might even sacrifice their lives in defense of the common\ngood. Society\u2019s natural purpose, the preservation of temporal\nlife of its members, was not in contradiction of the Church\u2019s\nend: the salvation of souls. In a Christian commonwealth, salvation\nwas the primary purpose, with human felicity as the secondary end. The\ncommonwealth transferred its power to the ruler, but his power\nultimately derived from God; and after its transfer of power to the\nruler, the commonwealth ceased to be able to legislate. Since the\nruler was within the commonwealth, he was bound by its laws. Vitoria\nstates that monarchy is the best form of government, but insists that\na commonwealth may be punished for the sins of its king, if he, for\nexample, wages an unjust war against another prince (ibid., qu. 1 art.\n8\u20139). This commonplace among the theorists of the ius\ngentium was important for some of the justifications of slavery\nand the slave trade, because captives in a just war traditionally\nbecame slaves and because the punishment of a commonwealth decided the\nfate of all its members, regardless of their individual guilt or\ninnocence. \n\nOnce different temporal regimes were created, each ruler was situated\nwithin a commonwealth. The ruler of France could not legislate for\nSpain. A ruler with multiple realms, like Emperor Charles V, had to\npromulgate laws in each region. Within a realm, custom was supposed to\nreinforce law or to be enforced itself. A ruler was best advised to\nsupport good customs. Vitoria faced the possibility that some laws\nmight be obeyed only by a few citizens, in which case they could be\nrevoked by the ruler. Revoking laws arbitrarily, however, might be\nsinful. Even a tyrant\u2019s laws had to be obeyed if they served the\ncommon good. Vitoria claimed that legislators are bound by civil laws\n(ibid., qu. 3 art. 4), but that the laws of tyrant are valid (ibid.,\nqu. 3 art. 6), a view which conflicts with positions later held by\nJesuits. The community, according to Vitoria, retained the right to\ndefend itself against a tyrant threatening its survival, but it could\nnot abolish a licit regime. The regime did not have to be Christian,\nbut a non-Christian regime could not be overthrown solely on the\ngrounds of injustice.\n\nSoto never denied that God is the ultimate origin of the Christian\ncommonwealth, but he distinguished between the natural and\nsupernatural order and held that, in the natural, temporal order,\npeace and tranquility have to be guaranteed by the commonwealth and\ncan be identified with the bonum commune (Grimm 2017:\n74\u201377; Soto, De iustitia et iure I qu. I art. ii). This\ninternal peace, the bonum commune, is the aim of any\nlegitimate law; on the other hand, it is stabilized by just laws,\nwhich are more easily followed in a peaceful society. In this way, the\ntheologians of the School of Salamanca implicitly paved the way for a\nsecular understanding of the state as a human institution that\npreserves peace and prosperity within a society. There are differences\nbetween some of the authors concerning the anthropological question of\nwhether human organizations and the distribution of property were\nalready to be found in statu innocentiae or only later, after\nthe Fall, when domination and property became necessary because of\nhuman weakness. \n\nMolina explained why and how domination was introduced after the Fall,\ncoining the term dominium iurisdictionis for temporal power,\nin contrast to dominium proprietatis (De iustitia et\niure II 20, II 22, II 23; Brett 2014), in order to avoid the\nequivocal use of the term dominium that had confused\ndiscussions since the debate on Franciscan poverty in thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries (Brett 1997). The political authority of the\ncommonwealth\u2014res publica\u2014is directly given by\nGod, as it was difficult to imagine that there was a new contract in\nevery generation. Nevertheless, the power (potestas) of the\ngovernment comes only indirectly from God and directly from the\nrepublic (De iustitia et iure II 26.4). Molina accepted the\ncommon Salamancan view that communities had transferred power to\nrulers.\n\nAll dominion was founded on natural reason, shared even by\nnon-Christians. \u201cGovernment is the channel through which the\nnatural power of the commonwealth is exercised\u201d (Costello 1983:\n49). Therefore, if a government misuses its power by trying to\nexercise a dominium proprietatis over its citizen, that is,\ntreating them like slaves, there is a right to resist. This also holds\nfor a king, notwithstanding that, for Molina, monarchy was the best\nform of government (De iustitia et iure II 23.10). While this\nresistance has to be supported by the common will of the citizens in\nthe case of abuse of power by a legitimate ruler, every citizen has\nthe right to kill an illegitimate usurper of power (ibid., III\n6.2).\n\nSu\u00e1rez believed that individual peoples reached agreement on\nthe need for government. God then granted rulers power to direct\nhumanity toward its proper ends. Critics of his thought, like Robert\nFilmer, objected to bringing in God at this late stage, in order to\nexplain the formation of regimes, rather than emphasizing his role in\nthe creation of commonwealths since Adam (Filmer 1680, chap. II [2]).\nSu\u00e1rez thought that it was the responsibility of the ruler to\npromote harmony between subjects, to exercise power well and to enact\nlaws to perfect the community. He also treated the relationship of law\nto conscience and that of ecclesiastical to lay powers. Like many\nrepresentatives of Spanish Scholasticism, Su\u00e1rez favored\nmonarchy, within limits, as the best regime. Individuals had the right\nto self-defense, as did the society as a whole, and they might resist\na ruler who acted badly. Su\u00e1rez even contemplated the\npossibility that tyrants could be killed for threatening the survival\nof the commonwealth. In his polemics against King James I of England,\nhe argued for the immunity of the Church from control by lay regimes.\nThe English oath, the so-called oath of allegiance that King James had\nrequired his subjects to take in 1606, the year after the Gunpowder\nPlot, he said, violated this immunity and undermined obedience to the\nRoman pontiff in spiritual matters. Su\u00e1rez was willing to\nbelieve that the pope could exhort the people to rise up against a\ntyrant or to invoke the aid of outsiders against one. Except in such\ncases, however, Christians were to obey their lay rulers in conformity\nwith natural law. This right to resistance was widely taken for\ngranted by the Jesuits and considerably expanded by Juan de Mariana\n(1536\u20131624). Although recent scholarship has cast doubt on the\ntraditional labeling of Mariana as an exponent of popular sovereignty\nand tyrannicide (Braun 2007), the Catholic zealot who assassinated\nHenry IV of France in 1610 is known to have referred to his\nwritings.\n5.3 Ethics and Casuistry\n\nSpanish Scholasticism reflects a long-standing tradition of teleology,\nwhich looked to the final cause of human conduct. Humans bore the\nimage of God, including the rationality Su\u00e1rez saw in all\nmortals. These beings could be moved by reason to right conduct,\nindividually and in politics. (Pink 2022: 279\u2013305). Spanish\nScholastics like Bartolom\u00e9 de Medina and Azpilcueta were deeply\nconcerned with casuistry, the means of guiding human conduct. Others,\nincluding some Protestants, used similar approaches. Casuistry can be\nfound in the discussion of such issues as lying through \u201cmental\nreservation\u201d. Cases of conscience were compiled to help in the\nguidance of souls, especially in avoidance of sin.\n\nThe uncertainties of life led to the development of the idea of\n\u201cprobabilism,\u201d looking to what was most likely when\ncertainty could not be obtained. Medina was a pioneer in this,\nclaiming that, when in doubt, one might discern the more probable\nopinion. This, in turn, permitted choosing the \u201cmore probable\noption\u201d\u2014or even a less probable choice\u2014in moral\ndecision making. It looks as if the first traces can already be found\nin writings of Vitoria and Alonso de la Vera Cruz (Eg\u00edo\nGarc\u00eda 2022). Probabilism was also used by some of the Jesuits\nwho were active in South America and Nueva Espa\u00f1a when they had\nto cope with problems of the treatment of Indigenous peoples and with\nAfrican slavery, e.g., Diego de Avenda\u00f1o (1594\u20131688)\n(Avenda\u00f1o 1668; Haar & Kaufmann 2023: Kap. 2.4.2.,\n4.2.).\n\nMore strictly, some theologians said to adopt only the safest course\nof action. Critics of such approaches, including Blaise Pascal,\ndenounced them for laxity, leading to use of \u201ccasuistry\u201d\nas a negative term (Sch\u00fcssler 2022). \n6. Ius gentium, ius ad bellum and the Enslavement of Amerindians, Africans, and Others\n\nAmong the most influential elements in the works from the School of\nSalamanca are those connected to what was called the ius\ngentium until the late eighteenth century but is nowadays\nreferred to as international law. Firstly, they separated the ius\ngentium from natural law, with which it had more or less been\nidentified with since the formulation of Roman Law; secondly, they\ndeveloped a martial law on the basis of quaestio 40 in the\nSecunda secundae of Thomas Aquinas\u2019s Summa\ntheologiae; and thirdly, they treated the alleged right to\nenslave non-European human beings.\n\nWhen James Brown Scott (1934: 3, 160) called Vitoria the father of\nmodern international law, it was mainly in reference to his lectures\non the problems associated with the Indies. Vitoria\u2019s opinions\non this matter loomed large in this debate. He addressed the Indies in\nthree relectiones: De temperantia (1537), De\nIndis (1539) and De iure belli (1539). In the first of\nthese he discussed cannibalism, while in the others he considered\nwhether a just war could be waged against indigenous peoples and\nwhether Spain\u2019s title to the Indies was valid. In addition,\nVitoria, lecturing on the Summa theologiae (1534), discussed\nevangelization. His account of the right to rule also extended to the\nrole of the clergy in evangelizing peoples who, before 1492, had never\nheard of Christ.\n\nAs mentioned above, in the first of his three lectures De\nIndis, delivered in the summer of 1539, he shows that the\nAmerindians were veri domini of their goods, even if they\nwere unbelievers, sinners and irrational (Vitoria 1991b:\n239\u2013250). He discussed the argument from Aristotle that\n\u201cbarbarians\u201d were little better than animals, madmen or\nthose lacking sense, then he turned to an argument of apologists for\nthe Conquista, claiming that Amerindians were infidels,\nliving in a perpetual state of mortal sin, requiring Christian\nintervention. He dismissed the argument from sin, on the grounds that\nsin did not cancel natural dominium. Brute beasts lacked such\nrights, but even children and the mad, although they had guardians,\nnevertheless had property rights. Aristotle wrote about those who\nneeded direction from others, but this did not negate ownership.\nVitoria extended rightful ownership even to Saracens. He blamed the\npoor education of indigenous peoples, which he compared to that of\nmany European peasants, for their depraved condition. Slavery, he\nadded, was a legal or civil construct. No one was a slave by\nnature.\n\nThe second lecture lists seven \u201cunjust titles\u201d for the war\nagainst the Amerindians. Vitoria rejected the idea that either the\nemperor or the pope is master of the world. He denied that Emperor\nCharles V could take away the domains of others. He cited Juan de\nTorquemada\u2019s Summa de ecclesia to prove that the\npope\u2019s supremacy was spiritual, not temporal; and he maintained\nthat the pope could not force unbelievers to convert. According to\nVitoria, discovery was not a justification for conquest; and he\nrefuted the view that sins against nature like cannibalism and incest,\nwhich were exceptions to the natural immunity that canon law allowed\nto non-believers, justified conquest. There were sinners in every\nnation, but the pope was not entitled to wage war against Christians\nwho were guilty of sin. Furthermore, neither the alleged voluntary\nchoice of the Amerindians nor the idea of a gift from God could\njustify the conquest of their territory (ibid., 252\u2013276).\n\nThe third lecture, finally, lists eight \u201cjust titles\u201d for\nthe war against Amerindians, among them the violation of the right of\nSpaniards to travel in the Indies and to conduct missions, the\nprotection of innocents, etc. (ibid., 278\u2013291). Vitoria argued\nfor free intercourse between all peoples: indigenous rulers could not\nexclude Christians from their lands, and Christian travelers attacked\nby the local inhabitants had the right of self-defense. Spanish\nchildren born in the New World were able to choose, under natural law\nand the ius gentium, to become citizens of the country where\nthey resided. Vitoria also argued for the right to evangelize.\nChristians could intervene to protect converts, allies and friends. He\nwarned, however, that waging war on indigenous peoples might obstruct\nconversion. Vitoria weakened his defense of the Indians by saying that\nSpain might govern them for their own benefit. The indigenous peoples\nmight even be treated \u201cpartly as slaves\u201d. Moreover, once\nlarge-scale conversions had taken place, Spain could not abandon the\nNew World.\n\nIn De temperantia Vitoria stated that all nations regarded\ncannibalism as an abomination. A prince might convert and suppress\nevil customs like human sacrifice on the grounds of justice; but\nforeign princes could not intervene. Vitoria also dismissed arguments\nfrom sins against nature as calumnies intended to excuse warfare and\nplunder.\n\nVitoria and the other authors of the School of Salamanca dealt with\nmartial law and developed a theory of just wars that was, on the one\nhand, based on Thomas Aquinas\u2019s arguments and, on the other\nhand, built on the foundation of the \u201cclassical doctrine of just\nwar\u201d (Orend 2006). Vitoria dealt with just war in his lecture\nDe Indis relectio posterior sive De iure belli. He discusses\nwho can wage war\u2014private persons only for self-defense, the\ncommonwealth and the prince also for other reasons (Vitoria 1991b,\n299\u2013302); what cannot be considered just reasons for waging war,\nsuch as difference in religion and enlargement of empire (ibid.,\n302\u2013304); what can be done in a just war (ibid., 304\u2013306,\n314\u2013317); and the view that it may not be enough if a prince\nbelieves that his war is just (ibid., 306\u2013307).\n\nVitoria regarded a \u201cperfect\u201d commonwealths as able to\ndefend themselves from internal and external threats. The right of\nself-defense permitted the use of force to repel force. A society,\npagan or Christian, could wage a just war in self-defense and execute\nmalefactors. Vitoria accepted repelling invaders and avenging injury\nas justifications for war, but not the invasion of realms in order to\nacquire land, slaves or plunder. Religious difference and the\nvainglory of princes were also not sufficient reasons. Those in\nauthority could declare and wage war, but they should take counsel\nabout this. Subjects could not refuse service in a just war. All\nnecessary means were acceptable in a just conflict, even entering an\nenemy\u2019s territory. Vitoria, however, applied a criterion of\nproportional harm to wars, so that a war was unjust if it caused more\nharm than good. Moreover, a ruler who had waged an unjust war was\nobliged to make restitution. Booty could recompense property unjustly\nseized by an enemy, but only if taken on a superior\u2019s orders.\nVitoria permitted enslaving Saracens defeated in a just conflict, but\nhe denied that Christians could enslave other Christians. Moreover, he\ndenounced devices used in capturing slaves for export. Overall,\nChristians were expected to abide by the rules of war, showing\nmoderation and humility when victorious.\n\nSimilar ideas\u2014legitimate authority; just cause, which only one\nside can have; trying all other ways of conflict resolution;\netc.\u2014can be found in Su\u00e1rez\u2019s De bello,\nthe thirteenth disputation of his De caritate. Molina,\nhowever, seems to have believed that, at least from a subjective point\nof view, both sides may believe that their cause is just (Fernandes\n2014).\n\nAccording to Molina, moreover, the ius gentium was not\nentirely a part of natural law, since it affirmed natural principles\nbut also embodied positive laws, including private property and\nslavery. Generally, it was in the period between Vitoria and\nSu\u00e1rez that natural law was separated from the ius\ngentium, further divided by Su\u00e1rez into the ius supra\ngentes (the law above nations) and the ius inter gentes\n(the law among nations), which eventually became international law in\nthe strict sense. Natural law and ius gentium were quite\nclose to each other in Roman law and in Thomas Aquinas; but Vitoria,\nin his commentary on quaestio 57 in the Secunda\nsecundae of the Summa theologiae, already maintained\nthat, for Thomas, the ius gentium was part of positive law.\nSu\u00e1rez makes it clear that, in contrast to natural law, which\nis inscribed in the heart of human beings and is immutably valid for\nall of them, the ius gentium is a positive convention among\npeoples or nations, which is valid for all or nearly for all of them;\nit includes the right to punish those who are defeated in a just war\nand, therefore, also the right of enslavement (De legibus II\nxviii 8).\n\nIt was furthermore the consensus among a majority of authors in the\nSchool of Salamanca that no wars could be waged against non-Christians\nby reason of their infidelity and that hostile actions could be\nresisted in self-defense. As we have seen, however, this natural\nimmunity did not extend to permitting cannibalism or human sacrifice.\nMolina, who favored the right to evangelize and permitted armed\nprotection for missionaries, was more wary than Vitoria of making free\ncommerce a right enforceable by war, using arguments which are\nsomewhat similar to those of Immanuel Kant, limiting\n\u201ccosmopolitan right \u2026 to conditions of universal\nhospitality\u201d in his treatise Toward Perpetual Peace\n(Kant 1795 [1996: 328\u2013331; Ak. 8:357\u2013360]). For Molina as\nfor Kant, the locals have merely charitable obligations towards those\nwho are arriving in their territories, if they are in need. They have\nno obligation to open them their ports. Countries might refuse to\ntrade if they feared that commerce was an excuse for conquest (Molina,\nDe iustitia et iure II 105). Just wars could be waged by\nrulers, but hating the enemy was prohibited. Subjects were obliged to\ninquire about a ruler\u2019s decision to wage a just war if there was\n\u201chonest doubt\u201d about it. Molina was willing to concede to\nthe pope a role mediating between Christian rulers, but he warned\nagainst intervening directly in their squabbles.\n\nOne of the recurring questions with respect to the treatment of\nindigenous peoples was whether their enslavement as slaves by nature\nin the traditional Aristotelian sense was justified. As mentioned\nabove, a famous discussion of this issue took place at the Junta of\nValladolid, when the Aristotelian Juan Gin\u00e9s Sep\u00falveda\ndebated with the Dominican Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, an ardent\ndefender of the Amerindians and their rights. Sep\u00falveda argued\nthat the Amerindians, as barbarians, were slaves by nature, more or\nless on the level of beasts. Las Casas maintained that although there\nwere humans so simple-minded that they could be considered slaves by\nnature, such people existed in Spain as well as in the Americas (Hanke\n1959: 28\u201374).\n\nSoto, who also participated in the debate in Valladolid, said that the\nius gentium was a universally applicable form of positive\nhuman law, which was created by applying reason to natural principles.\nThis law governed trade, exchange of envoys and even slavery, if it\nspared lives during war. It also included respect for property, even\nof non-Christians, to avoid squabbles over possessions. Nor was\nconversion a just reason for going to war and enslaving conquered\npeoples.\n\nSoto once considered going to the New World to resolve the\ncontroversies there. Unable to go himself, he advocated sending good\nmissionaries. In addition, his writings were employed by the Third\nMexican Council (1585) in preparation of a confessors\u2019 manual\ngeared to a world of both Hispanic and Amerindian residents (Salcedo,\nDirectorio para Confesores). Soto\u2019s relectio\non dominion concluded that Spain\u2019s title to the Indies was hard\nto justify. He rejected the opinion of Sep\u00falveda on the justice\nof waging war on infidels, also Pope Alexander VI\u2019s division of\noverseas domains between Spain and Portugal. Soto was trusted by all\nparticipants in the Junta of Valladolid to summarize the conflicting\nopinions of Las Casas and Sep\u00falveda, though he, or perhaps Cano\n(Cano 1605), another critic of conquest, may have been the one person\nwho, according to Sep\u00falveda, opposed him. The Dominicans of\nSalamanca continued to argue for just conduct by Spaniards in their\noverseas dominions; and also Jesuits like Molina, even in their\ndefense of slavery and slave trade, did not refer to the concept of\nslaves by nature. Soto, though accepting slavery, rejected the idea of\nnatural slavery: in his view, human beings who were incapable of\nleading their own lives clearly had to be guided by wiser men, but for\nreasons of their own well-being, not as living tools in the\nAristotelian sense. So, slavery for him was merely conventional.\n\nMolina, who wrote the first treatise on the Portuguese transatlantic\nslave trade, followed Soto on this point, accepting only conventional\nslavery. He justified slavery and mentioned the four just titles for\nenslavement: committing certain crimes; being captured in a just war;\nselling oneself because of urgent need; and the principle of\npartus sequitur ventrem, that is, the children of enslaved\nmothers also are slaves (De iustitia et iure II disp. 33).\nThen he described the history of the Portuguese slave trade and gave a\ncritical evaluation of it (ibid., disp. 34\u201335). Interestingly,\nalthough he dealt intensively with the transatlantic slave trade,\nespecially from Africa, he never put forward a justification for\nenslavement based on race such as Noah\u2019s curse on the children\nof Ham (Genesis 9:20\u201327) for mocking his drunken nakedness.\n\nIt may be, at first glance, astonishing that the impact of what we\ntoday call race\u2014as stated above, the term mostly used until the\nsecond half of the eighteenth century was\n\u201cnation\u201d\u2014was increasingly used among the Jesuit\nauthors following Molina, although they were referring to his relevant\ndisputations (De iustitia et iure II disp. 33\u201340).\nAlonso de Sandoval (1577\u20131652), e.g., who spent most of his life\nin Cartagena (Columbia) and was named defensor de los negros,\nwrote very doleful and touching passages about the terrible situation\nof the black slaves in South America. But he had no doubt that their\nenslavement was just, using Noah\u2019s curse as one of the reasons\nfor this (Sandoval 1627, I 2, I 3, I 17, II 2), Haar & Kaufmann\n2023: Kap. 2.4.1.). Diego de Avenda\u00f1o (1594\u20131688) was\nraised by the Jesuits in Lima, where he became professor of theology\nand rector of the Col\u00e9gio Maximo de San Pablo de Lima,\npositions he held until his death. In his Thesaurus Indicus\nin a section entitled \u201cDe contractibus Aethiopum\u201d, he\nholds, on the one hand, that contracts with Africans on enslavement\nbear an enormous risk for a Christian conscience because they hardly\never fulfill the criteria of justice (Avenda\u00f1o 1668: Lib. I\nTitulus IX, cap. XII. n. 180 [2001: 324]). On the other hand, he\ndeclares that those contracts are \u201csomehow\u201d\n(aliqualiter) justifiable for a number of reasons, one of\nwhich is that Africans are born to serve and are the \u201cleast\namong men\u201d (vilissimi inter homines) (ib. n. 204, p.\n330, Haar & Kaufmann 2023: Kap. 2.4.2.). Obviously, the\n\u201cnecessity\u201d of justifying the discriminatory treatment of\nAfrican people via their alleged shortcomings became more and more\nurgent the longer the cruel exploitation, which contradicted all\nhumanitarian and Christian principles, lasted.\n7. Economic Theory\n\nAlongside the debates on just war, colonization and the slave trade,\neconomics is perhaps the most striking example of how the theologians\nfrom the School of Salamanca used and transformed traditional medieval\ntheories in order to deal with new situations, creating innovative\nsolutions that had long-lasting influence. They have often been\nmentioned as the ancestors of the Austrian School of Economics, which\nin the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries emphasized the role of\nthe consumer\u2019s estimation in the development of prices and the\nimportance of the market against any attempt of rationally planning\neconomic processes, while Molina has been described as a \u201csolid\neconomic liberal\u201d (Rothbard 1995 [2006: 113]). This may be a\nrestrictive interpretation, because there is an undeniable relevance\nof the medieval heritage with its rigid condemnation of usury to be\nfound in the authors from the School of Salamanca. Their views on\neconomy are founded in natural law, implying therefore a normative\nview of economic processes instead of the purely strategic rationality\nof a homo oeconomicus. Nonetheless, the general consensus is\nthat there are liberal elements in late Scholastic economics\n(Sch\u00fcssler 2014). Among the topics they dealt with were public\nfinance, the danger of exhausting public treasuries and of excessive\ntaxes (Chafuen 2003: 53\u201360), the just price for different goods\nand the problem of charging interest for lending money, which was\nconnected to the traditional condemnation of usury. The exchange of\nmoney was another major issue, because there were a large number of\nmonetary systems simultaneously in use within the Spanish and\nPortuguese kingdoms. According to Marjory Grice-Hutchinson, who\npublished an early and still important volume on their monetary\ntheory, the original contribution of the School of Salamanca in this\nfield consists \n\n\nin its formulation of a psychological theory of value applied to both\ngoods and money, of the quantity theory, and of a theory of foreign\nexchange that closely resembles the modern purchasing-power parity\ntheory. (Grice-Hutchinson 1952: 47\u201348)\n\n\nA more or less common view of Spanish Scholastics on just price is\nthat the value of goods\u2014and money\u2014depends on estimation,\nnot primarily on the costs of production, nor on the needs of buyers\n(Grice-Hutchinson 1952: 48\u201351). It is not the communis\naestimatio of theologians that determines the natural price, but\nrather that of businessmen, as Molina says (De iustitia et\niure II 407); and it is not a fixed margin, but moves within a\ncertain range, depending also on the quantity of goods and money\navailable. Monopolies are criticized by Molina because they make such\na determination of just price impossible (ibid., II 345). Some authors\nargued for a public limitation on the price of foodstuffs. Molina\nfavored support of the poor but hesitated to make only corn dealers\npay for it, because a fixed price would prevent merchants from\nimporting corn, thus damaging the common good (ibid., II 365).\n\nThe first formulation of the quantity theory of money is often\nattributed to the jurist Martin de Azpilcueta, perhaps the best known\nSalamancan writer on economic issues. In an appendix to his manual for\nconfessors, now published as On Exchange (2014), he discussed\nexchange, supply and demand, and money. Azpilcueta attempted to\nexplain the rampant inflation of the sixteenth century as connected to\nthe large-scale importation of specie from the New World. Goods, he\nargued, were more costly when money was abundant. This quantity theory\nof money was widely accepted throughout Europe.\n\nAzpilcueta, moreover, maintained that the exchange of money is not\nunnatural, contradicting Aristotle and many Scholastics. He treated\nmoney like other merchandise, positing that the morality of exchanges\nwhich were not dependent on money as their object was equitable. There\nwere different questions connected to exchange. One of these was\nwhether, in the case of petty exchange, it was licit to take more than\nthe legally fixed commission; this view was rejected, and the legal\ncommission was seen as binding in conscience (Alonso-Lasheras 2011:\n172\u2013173.). Another problem arose in relation to exchange bills\nbecause the value of money varied considerably between different\nplaces within the Spanish Empire, offering new possibilities of making\nand losing money. Spanish writers such as Azpilcueta and Molina\ncountered the suspicion of usury associated with this kind of business\nby means of an early version of purchasing power theory according to\nwhich the exchange rates between currencies are in equilibrium when\ntheir purchasing power, i.e., what can be bought with a certain amount\nof money, remains the same (Grice-Hutchinson 1952: 52\u201353;\nAlonso-Lasheras 2011: 179). Concerning the topic of lending money,\nauthors like Molina justified taking interest, first, by the\nlucrum cessans, the amount of money that the lender could\nhave made during the time it was on loan as a credit and, then, by the\npericulum sortis, the risk that he might lose his capital\n(Molina, De iustitia et iure II 315).\n\nDespite the liberal elements which can be found in the works of\nauthors from the School of Salamanca, they nevertheless had a\ncompletely different understanding of the market from that of modern\nneoliberals. \n\n\nThe market was first of all a physical place in which real people came\ntogether. These people possessed a moral conscience that was also part\nof the economic process. (Alonso-Lasheras 2011: 169)\n\n8. Metaphysics and Logic\n\nSpanish theologians were also involved in traditional discussions of\nlogic and metaphysics. Two representative examples will be discussed:\nSoto\u2019s Summulae, a compendium on logic which is little\nknown today but which at the time was the compendium on logic\nin the Thomist tradition, ordered and paid for by the University of\nSalamanca in order to resist the influence of Nominalism; and\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s famous and much studied treatise,\nDisputationes metaphysicae.\n8.1 Soto on Logic\n\nSoto is regarded as responsible for the revival of Spanish-Thomist\nlogic, as distinct from both Renaissance-oriented logic, which used\nonly ancient sources, and the extremely technical\n\u201csophistic\u201d logic of Nominalism. His main sources were\nAristotle, Thomas Aquinas and Petrus Hispanus\u2019s Summulae\nlogicales, from all of which, however, he deviated in many areas.\nIn his Summulae, especially starting with the second edition\nof 1547, which became one of the most influential textbooks of this\ngenre, he gives an introduction to traditional logic, including a\ntheory of terms, propositions and conclusions (Soto 1980). Whereas\nPetrus Hispanus had been criticized for serious inconsistencies, Soto\ngives his own interpretation, in an effort to build up a coherent\ndoctrine. In the presentation of the different kinds of terms, he did\nnot follow the Aristotelian categories, but instead presented the\nmedieval distinctions between mental, written and spoken terms,\nbetween categorematic and syncategorematic terms (that is, terms that\nhave a meaning because they refer to things, concepts or other terms\nand those which only make sense within propositions as connections,\nbut cannot be a subject or predicate, such as \u201cif\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, etc.), between absolute and connotative terms, and\nso on. He continued by presenting different kinds of proposition,\nincluding a version of supposition theory\u2014the doctrine of the\nentities that the terms in a proposition, subject and predicate stand\nfor (ibid., 31\u201336). Here Soto also discussed Nominalist and\nrealist objections; but, in the end, he mostly defended the positions\nof Petrus Hispanus, largely omitting, however, complicated types of\nsupposition such as distributive, confused, merely confused, etc.,\nwhich had long puzzled medieval authors. The third book explains the\ndifferent kinds of relation between propositions, including an\nextended version of the square of oppositions (ibid., 72), as well as\ntruth conditions for modal propositions, conjunctions and\ndisjunctions. In his discussion of the different kinds of valid and\ninvalid conclusion, Soto not only referred to syllogisms (book 5) and\nthe so-called insolubilia, or reflections on paradoxes (book\n6), but also elements of the theory of consequentiae, a\nmedieval type of logical conclusion that may go back to the Stoic\nlogic of propositions (Read 1993; D\u2019Ors 1983).\n\nWhile the Summulae provide something like a basic\nintroduction to the logical topics discussed at the time, Soto\u2019s\nIn dialecticam Aristotelis commentarii (Salamanca, 1543)\ncontains philosophical reflections on questions such as whether logic\nis a science and if so, what kind of logic, the logica docens\nin contrast to logica utens, which is a \u201cmode of\nknowing\u201d, and whether the subject of dialectics is an ens\nrationis (Di Liso 2000: 221\u2013250). These reflections are\npresented within the context of a selective commentary on the\nAristotelian Organon, omitting De interpretatione and the\nAnalytica Priora, which were treated in the Summulae\n(ibid.). He also wrote Super octo libros Physicorum\ncommentarii and Super octo libros Physicorum quaestiones\nas part of the Artes liberales course.\n8.2 Su\u00e1rez\u2019s Metaphysics\n\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s Disputationes metaphysicae (1597) was\npublished in eighteen editions over a few decades in printing centers\nthroughout Europe\u2014not only in Catholic, but also in Protestant\nregions\u2014and had an enormous influence on philosophy teaching in\nEuropean universities. It is still considered to be the most complete\nand comprehensive presentation of prima philosophia; and it\nwas the most important link between Scholastic metaphysics and\nseventeenth-century school philosophy, influencing Descartes, Leibniz\nand Wolff. Although modern scholars debate the roots of the extremely\ncomplicated system of metaphysics which Su\u00e1rez presents in the\ntreatise, they seem to agree that he created a kind of synthesis of\nThomist and Scotist theories. Only a very general survey of the topics\ndiscussed in Su\u00e1rez\u2019s 54 metaphysical disputations can be\nprovided here, along with a brief mention of some of the most\nimportant approaches to their interpretation.\n\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s Disputationes do not follow the\nstructure of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics. Instead, he\nstarts with an extensive introduction to the Aristotelian treatise,\naccording to a slightly different order than in modern editions, and\nindicates the precise places where the topics discussed there can be\nfound in his disputations. His first disputation reflects on the\nnature metaphysics as prima philosophia. It is followed by\ndisputations on the concept of being (ens), its passions,\ndifferent understandings of unity, on the true and the false, and the\ngood and the bad. The pivotal role that these\n\u201ctranscendentals\u201d of medieval metaphysics play in\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s metaphysics was the basis for the interpretation\nof his theoretical philosophy as transcendental (Honnefelder 1990).\nNext come sixteen disputations dedicated to the four Aristotelian\ncauses (material, formal, efficient and final), followed by the\nvarious divisions of being (infinite and finite, uncreated and\ncreated\u2014including some kind of rational theology which discusses\nquestions such as whether God can be recognized with natural reason\n(Disp. XXIX), whether there are physical proofs for God\u2019s\nexistence (Disp. XXX) etc.\u2014and the division of created being\ninto substance and accidents). Then there are about twenty\ndisputations dealing with the Aristotelian categories, concluding with\none on the special theoretical problems associated with the concept of\nens rationis, which does not belong to any of the previously\ndiscussed categories.\n\nInterpretations of the Disputationes metaphysicae over the\nlast decades have all attempted to fit Su\u00e1rez into a kind of\ntheoretical history (Darge 2004: 7\u201326). Gilson (1949) identified\nan essentialism (according to the Thomist distinction between\nens and essentia) that neglects the act of being in\nfavor of a purely abstract conceptualization and that can be traced in\na line of thinkers from Avicenna through Duns Scotus and Su\u00e1rez\nto Wolff and Kant. Honnefelder (1990) sees Su\u00e1rez as dependent\non the same earlier philosophers, but he does not present it as a\nhistory of decadence from a Thomist perspective, as Gilson did, but\nrather as a success story for the transcendental Scotist approach.\nScotus uses a univocal instead of an analogous concept of being for\ncreated and uncreated substance (i.e., God) and individuates the realm\nof what may be meant by \u201cbeing\u201d, based on the most general\nunderstanding of being as \u201cid cui non repugnat\nesse\u201d, i.e., the existence of which does not imply logical\ncontradictions. Furthermore, he gives a modal explication of the\ndifferent grades of finite and infinite being including the existence\nof finite and infinite substance. Courtine (1990) and Boulnois (1999)\nshare this \u201cScotist perspective\u201d, but they see it more as\na move from the science of what is to the science of what can be\nthought, that is, an onto-logic. Precisely in the years when the term\n\u201contology\u201d was coined by Rudolf Goclenius (Lamanna 2014),\nit no longer referred to the \u201cfurniture of the universe\u201d,\nas Putnam (1985: 28) called it, but instead to ways of thinking and\nspeaking about the things in the world\u2014a process that ends with\nthe determination of what is through our speaking about it. Darge,\nfinally, tries to free Su\u00e1rez from this purely logicistic\ninterpretation and from the Scotist perspective, in order to emphasize\nhis innovative merits against his classification as an intermediate\nfigure between Duns Scotus and Thomas, on the one hand, and Wolff and\nKant, on the other. There is no doubt, however, that\n\u201cRenaissance and Baroque Scholastic culture\u201d, to which\nSu\u00e1rez doubtlessly belongs, has finally become an object of\nserious research (Nov\u00e1k 2014: 2). This research is not only\nproviding a general systematization and historical integration of\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s metaphysics, but also investigating particular\naspects of his extremely rich theory (B. Hill 2012; Nov\u00e1k\n2014).\n9. The Influence of the School of Salamanca\n\nIt is difficult to give a precise evaluation of the influence of the\nSchool of Salamanca in the many fields to which it contributed. There\nare various ideological motives, apart from the general tendency to\nconceal one\u2019s sources, why later authors did not mention these\ntheologians. This was especially the case for philosophers,\ntheologians and legal theorists from the Protestant North with their\naversion to Catholic thinkers, and especially Jesuits. Quarrels arose,\nfor instance, as to whether the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius\n(1583\u20131645) was the father of modern natural law and\ninternational law or whether he only copied and slightly altered the\nworks of Su\u00e1rez and other Spanish authors. Another pertinent\nissue is that Su\u00e1rez was regarded as the\nrepresentative of \u201cthe schools\u201d, to which the founders of\nmodern philosophy opposed their new philosophical systems, often\ndenying their heritage. Some works by Spanish Scholastics therefore\nfell into oblivion. In recent years, however, the ideological barriers\nhave vanished, and there is a growing interest in an open-minded\ndiscussion of the School\u2019s achievements and impact.\n\nAs has been indicated, the School of Salamanca is credited with a role\nin the development of international law. The gradual detachment of the\nius gentium from natural law, particularly as it pertained to\nissues such as slavery and the slave trade, was another notable\naccomplishment; so too, was its consistent defense of the full\nhumanity of the Amerindians. That argument could be applied to other\nnon-European peoples who had also never heard of Jesus; their regimes\nand property rights were closely tied to reason and natural law.\n\nThe School, in addition, made important contributions to areas such as\ntrade and finance. Azpilcueta\u2019s approach to inflation and his\ndefense of the morality of exchange was a step toward a culture of\naccepted risk and profit. Vitoria\u2019s argument that commerce fell\nwithin the ius gentium was not embraced by everyone in the\nSchool; but this argument had a direct influence on Grotius. Moreover,\nalthough a Protestant and an opponent of papal claims to temporal\npower, Grotius drew on Thomas Aquinas, Cajetan, and Vitoria to argue\nfor the freedom of the seas and to develop a framework for\ninternational law. Because of the School\u2019s role in the\ndevelopment of economic theory, some economists, including those\nbelonging to the Austrian School of National Economy, refer to them as\ntheir ancestors.\n\nSu\u00e1rez and Mariana formulated theories of resistance to\nunacceptable rulers, which Roman Catholic thinkers engaged in opposing\nProtestantism and Protestant rulers like James I found attractive. In\nthe heated atmosphere of the times, it is possible that these theories\nmay have inspired the Catholic fanatics who assassinated Henry III\n(Valois), Henry IV (Bourbon), and William the Silent (Nassau). Similar\ntheories were also developed by Protestant writers, including French\nHuguenots and Calvinists in the Low Countries.\n\nMembers of the School of Salamanca departed from Aristotle and Thomas\nAquinas as they saw fit. This is apparent in Soto\u2019s logic and\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s widely read metaphysics. Less noted until\nrecently is the influence of Soto on Galileo. Diverging from\nAristotle, Soto advanced theories that have been described (Duhem\n1913: 193) as forerunners of the modern idea of mechanics. His theory\nof falling bodies was well known to Jesuit scholars, who circulated it\nthrough their writings. As a young student, Galileo was probably\nexposed to these ideas, which influenced his approach to the physical\nlaws governing the universe (Wallace 1981 and 2004). Galileo\u2019s\ntheories about falling bodies eclipsed Soto\u2019s, while his\nastronomical observations helped to create a heliocentric and\nun-Aristotelian intellectual milieu, in which many ideas of the School\nof Salamanca were regarded as obsolete. Even in Spain,\nthe novatores thought the Scholastics were no longer\nrelevant, not even having read Descartes (G\u00f3mez Par\u00eds\n2022: 563, 570).\n\nStarting in the 1930s, with the work of James Brown Scott and others,\nthe School of Salamanca gained renewed attention for its contribution\nto ideas of international law, including respect for non-Christian\npeoples.
