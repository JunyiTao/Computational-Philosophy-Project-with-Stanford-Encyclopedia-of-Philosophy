    "main_text": "Philosophical diagnoses of the scientific debates || Special-purpose faculties and the limits of empiricist science\n2.2 Special-purpose faculties and the limits of empiricist science\n\nThe question, \u201cwhat are nativism debates about?\u201d has been\ncarefully analyzed by Fiona Cowie (1998), who distinguishes two\narguments historically deployed in defense of nativism. Poverty of\nthe stimulus arguments claim that the environment lacks\nsufficient information for an organism to learn some belief, cognitive\ndisposition, or behavior. If an individual nonetheless acquires that\ncognitive trait, then the process must have involved some amount of\n\u201cinnate\u201d information. A second type of argument, which\nCowie (1998) calls impossibility arguments, claim that\ncertain traits must be innate not because the environment is\nimpoverished, but rather because scientific accounts of the\nacquisition process are doomed to failure. This distinction leads\nCowie (1998) to propose two fundamental disagreements underlying\ndebates over nativism. The \u201cspecial faculties\u201d debate\nconcerns the basic architecture of the mind. Nativists posit\nspecial-purpose learning faculties to explain acquisition, whereas\nanti-nativists explain acquisition in terms of domain general\nlearning. The \u201cmystery\u201d debate, however, turns on a\nskeptical claim about the limits of scientific explanation. As Cowie\nexplains:\n\nImpossibility arguments\u2026 work to undermine the empiricist\nassumption that the processes underpinning our acquisition of ideas\nand beliefs are simply a species of natural phenomena, amenable at\nleast in principle to natural scientific explanation. (1998, 50)\n\n\nCowie is describing an extremely strong form of anti-empiricist\nskepticism. When directed at the explanatory prospects of science in\ngeneral it is unlikely that this brand of nativism will be appealing\nto naturalistic philosophers or scientists. However, skepticism of\nthis kind may be directed at specific scientific theories or\nexplanatory frameworks. Cowie (1998) discusses Jerry Fodor\u2019s\n(1975; 1981) peculiar-sounding hypothesis that most concepts \u2013\ne.g. our concept of a doorknob \u2013 are innate. On Cowie\u2019s\nreading, Fodor is offering an impossibility argument: concept\nacquisition cannot in principle be explained by an empiricist\nmodel of associative learning. The following section (2.3) looks more\nclosely at psychological primitivism, a more developed version of\nCowie\u2019s mystery hypothesis. The remainder of this section\nfocuses on the special-faculties hypothesis.\n\nCowie (1998; 2009) acknowledges a limitation of the special-faculties\nhypothesis. It applies only to debates in psychology over the\nkinds of learning process underlying the acquisition of beliefs or\nbehaviors. This is a problem because disputes about nativism are not\nconfined to psychology. For instance, we saw in the previous section\nthat Weismann (1891 (1888)) drew a sharp distinction between\nhereditary versus acquired traits generally. The special faculties\nhypothesis apparently cannot explain such non-psychological\ndisputes.\n\nOne potential way of rescuing the special-faculties hypothesis is to\nunderscore the difference between nativism in psychology compared to\ninnateness hypotheses in other disciplines, such as biology. Richard\nSamuels (2002), who does not defend the special-faculties hypothesis,\nnonetheless maintains that innateness is a distinctively psychological\nconcept. According to Samuels, to identify some trait as innate means\nabove all that it is unlearned, and to identify some trait as learned\nimplies that it is not innate. Samuels (2002) calls this the\nfundamental conceptual constraint on any analysis of\ninnateness. If Samuels is correct on this point, such that questions\nabout nativism are ultimately about the presence/absence of learning,\nthen it is no shortcoming of the special-faculties hypothesis that it\nfocuses on psychological traits. One noteworthy difference between\nCowie\u2019s special-faculties hypothesis and Samuels\u2019\nfundamental constraint is that the former distinguishes among learning\n\u201cmechanisms\u201d (general vs special purpose), whereas the\nlatter distinguishes more broadly between learned versus unlearned\ntraits.\n",
