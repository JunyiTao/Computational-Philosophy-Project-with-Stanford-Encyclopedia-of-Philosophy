    "main_text": "\n\nAnalytic feminists are philosophers who believe that both philosophy\nand feminism are well served by using some of the concepts, theories,\nand methods of analytic philosophy modified by feminist values and\ninsights. By using \u201canalytic feminist\u201d to characterize\ntheir style of feminist philosophizing, these philosophers acknowledge\ntheir dual feminist and analytic roots and their intention to\nparticipate in the ongoing conversations within both traditions. In\naddition, the use of \u201canalytic feminist\u201d attempts to rebut\ntwo frequently made presumptions: that feminist philosophy rejects all\nthe assumptions of modernism and that analytic philosophy is\nirredeemably\n male-biased.[1]\n Thus by naming themselves analytic feminists, these philosophers\naffirm the existence and political value of their work.\n\nReaders with a strong desire to \u201ccut to the chase\u201d may\njump to the fourth section, on\n characteristics of analytic feminism.\n The first three sections set the context for analytic feminism by\nexplaining the relationships between analytic feminists and the\nvarious traditions they share.\n",
