    "main_text": "Metaphysical Preliminaries || Causality\n2.1 Causality\n\nThere is a tradition that stretches back at least as far as Russell\n(1913) that denies that there is any place for causal notions in the\nfundamental sciences, including physics: the notion serves no purpose,\nand simply does not appear, in the fundamental sciences. The argument\ngoes that, since at least the nineteenth century, the laws that govern\nphysical behavior in fundamental sciences such as physics are almost\nalways differential equations. Such equations are notable for\nspecifying, given some initial conditions, exact properties of systems\nfor all time. And thus if everything is specified for all time, there\nis no place left for causality. Thus Russell advocates that\n\u201ccausality\u201d should be eliminated from the philosophers\nlexicon, because it is certainly not a part of the scientific\nlexicon.\n\nIn contrast to Russell\u2019s position, Cartwright (1979: 420) claims\nthat we do have a need and use for a causal vocabulary in science:\n\u201ccausal laws cannot be done away with, for they are needed to\nground the distinction between effective strategies and ineffective\nones\u201d. One of the main contemporary accounts of causation, the\ninterventionist account of causation (Woodward 2003; see also the\nentry on\n causation and manipulability),\n is an embodiment of Cartwright\u2019s dictum. In a nutshell, the\ninterventionist account claims that A is a cause of B if\nand only if manipulating A is an effective means of\n(indirectly) manipulating B. Causality in the present entry,\nunless specified otherwise, should be understood along broadly\ninterventionist lines. According to accounts of quantum theory that\nhypothesize retrocausality, manipulating the setting of a measurement\napparatus can be an effective means of manipulating aspects of the\npast. A broadly interventionist view of causality indeed underlies\nmost contemporary attempts to harness the tool kit of causal modeling\n(see the entry on\n causal models;\n Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 2000; Pearl 2009) in the foundations\nof quantum theory (Leifer & Spekkens 2013; Cavalcanti & Lal\n2014; Costa & Shrapnel 2016; Allen et al. 2017).\n\nUsing the notion of causality along broadly interventionist lines in\nthe foundations of quantum theory does not commit one to realism (or\nanti-realism) about the causal relations at issue. Woodward combines\ninterventionism with realism about causality while acknowledging \n\n\nimportant differences between, on the one hand, the way in which\ncausal notions figure in common sense and the special sciences and the\nempirical assumptions that underlie their application and, on the\nother hand, the ways in which these notions figure in physics.\n(Woodward 2007: 67; although see Frisch 2014: chs. 4 and 5 for a\nresponse) \n\n\nAnother suggested strategy to take into account Russell\u2019s worry\nwhile continuing to apply causal notions in physics in a consistent\nmanner is to understand interventionism in \u201cperspectival\u201d\nterms (Price 2007; Price & Corry 2007; Price & Weslake 2010;\nIsmael 2016). Perspectivalism is usually staged, as seems natural in\nthe setting of modern physics (although more will be said on this\nbelow), in the framework of a block universe view where the past,\npresent, and future are equally real. In this framework, causality\ncannot have anything to do with changing the future or the\npast because both are\u2014from an \u201cexternal\u201d\nperspective\u2014completely \u201cfixed\u201d. But one can\nunderstand causation in the block universe from an\n\u201cinternal\u201d perspective, according to which causal\ncorrelations are precisely those that are stable under interventions\non those variables that we refer to as the \u201ccauses\u201d.\n\nThe important difference between the two viewpoints\u2014internal and\nexternal to the block\u2014is that there is a discrepancy between the\nparts of the spacetime block that are epistemically accessible from\neach perspective. The spatiotemporally constrained perspective by\nwhich we are bound permits us only limited epistemic accessibility to\nother spatiotemporal regions. This is the perspective in which,\naccording to causal perspectivalism, causal notions are perfectly\nserviceable. Once, on the other hand, we imagine ourselves to be\nomniscient beings that have epistemic access to the whole\nspatiotemporal block, it should not come as a surprise that our causal\nintuitions get confused when we attempt to consider how a\nspatiotemporally bound agent can deliberate about whether or not to\naffect a particular event that is already determined from our imagined\nomniscient perspective. It is because we do not know which\nevents are determined to occur and are ignorant about many others that\nwe can be deliberative agents at all. Again, these considerations are\nrelevant just as much to ordinary forward-in-time causation as they\nare to backward-in-time causation.\n\nMany of the retrocausal approaches to quantum theory considered in\n \u00a76\n are best understood with some type of perspectival interventionist\naccount of causality in mind. A notable exception is the transactional\ninterpretation\n (\u00a75),\n in which causality might be best understood in terms of processes\nunderscored by conserved quantities. The possibilist extension of the\ntransactional interpretation, defended by Kastner (2006, 2013),\nmoreover eschews the block universe picture.\n",
