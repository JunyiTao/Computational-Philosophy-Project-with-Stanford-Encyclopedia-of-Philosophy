For\npatients who lack the relevant decision-making capacity at the time the\ndecision is to be made, a need arises for surrogate decision-making:\nsomeone else must be entrusted to decide on their behalf. Patients who\nformerly possessed the relevant decision-making capacity might have\nanticipated the loss of capacity and left instructions for how future\nmedical decisions ought to be made. Such instructions are called an\nadvance directive. One type of advance directive simply designates who\nthe surrogate decision-maker should be. A more substantive advance\ndirective, often called a living will, specifies particular principles\nor considerations meant to guide the surrogate's decisions in various\ncircumstances, for example, \u201cDo not prolong my life if I enter\npersistent vegetative state,\u201d or \u201cI am a fighter: do not\ndiscontinue life-sustaining treatment no matter what happens to\nme.\u201d\n\nThis general framework opens up a number of ethical issues. I shall set\naside here a foundational issue that is a subject of its own\nencyclopedia article: What are the criteria for\n decision-making capacity?\n These must be specified before we can establish, on any\ngiven occasion, whether there would be any need at all for\ndecision-making by a third party (with the aid of an advance directive\nor not). Assuming we have settled, using the appropriate criteria, that\nsurrogate decision-making is indeed called for, the following main\nissues arise:\n\n\nQ1.

The orthodox legal view\n\n\nIn legal contexts, two general standards or approaches to question\nQ2 have been developed:\n\n\nThe Substituted Judgment standard: The surrogate's task is to\nreconstruct what the patient himself would have wanted, in the\ncircumstances at hand, if the patient had decision-making capacity.\nSubstantive advance directives are here thought of as a helpful\nmechanism for aiding the application of Substituted Judgment. The\nmoral principle underlying this legal standard is the principle of\n respect\n for \n autonomy,\n supplemented by the idea that when a patient is not currently capable\nof making a decision for himself, we can nonetheless respect his\nautonomy by following or reconstructing, as best we can, the\nautonomous decision he would have made if he were able. In a subset\nof cases, a substituted judgment can implement an actual earlier\ndecision of the patient, made in anticipation of the current\ncircumstances; this is known as precedent autonomy.\n\nThe Best Interests standard: The surrogate is to decide based\non what, in general, would be good for the\npatient. The moral principle underlying this standard is the principle of\n beneficence.\nThis legal standard has traditionally assumed a quite generic view of\ninterests, asking what a \"reasonable\" person would want under the\ncircumstances and focusing on general goods such as freedom from pain,\ncomfort, restoration and/or development of the patient's physical and\nmental capacities. This is because the Best Interests standard has\nmainly been employed when there is little or no information about the\npatient's specific values and preferences. However, the concept of\nbest interests is simply the concept of what is best for the\nperson. There is no reason why, in principle, the Best Interests\njudgment could not be as nuanced and individual as the best theory of\n well-being\n dictates.\n\n\n\nIn practice, the main difference between the two standards is often\nthought to be this. Substituted Judgment endeavors to reconstruct the\nsubjective point of view of the patient \u2014 i.e., the patient's\nown view of his interests \u2014 whenever such reconstruction is a\nviable possibility. By contrast, the Best Interests standard allows\nfor a more generic view of interests, without having to rely on the\nidiosyncratic values and preferences of the patient in question.\n\nThe applicability of these standards depends on the context in which\nthe lack of decision-making capacity occurs. Let us distinguish two\ngroups of patients:\n\n\nFormerly Competent: Patients who used to have the relevant\n decision-making capacity,\n but lost it, for example, due to Alzheimer's disease or\nother medical problems (or procedures such as surgical anesthesia)\nundermining normal brain functioning.\n\nNever-been Competent: Patients who have never had the\nrelevant decision-making capacity, either because the capacity has not\nyet developed (as in children), or because of a permanent brain\ndeficiency such as severe congenital mental retardation.\n\n\n\nThe Substituted Judgment standard seems well-suited to the\ncircumstances of the formerly competent patients since, in their case,\nthere are past values or patterns of decision-making that could\npotentially serve as a basis for the reconstructed decision on the\npatient's behalf. Furthermore, according to the current orthodoxy,\nprevalent especially in the law, Substituted Judgment is the preferred\nsolution for formerly competent patients because it promises to preserve respect for\n autonomy\n as an overriding moral consideration trumping concerns with\n beneficence.\nThe picture is this. If, ordinarily, we ought to respect patient\nautonomy rather than impose our own judgments on patients, we ought to\nrespect autonomy even after the patient has lost decision-making\ncapacity; and we can do so by following or reconstructing, as best we\ncan, the autonomous decision the patient would have made himself when\nfaced with the current circumstances. In short, in dealing with\nsomeone who used to be competent, the widely accepted primacy of\nrespect for autonomy over beneficence calls for Substituted\nJudgment. And this means that we should use the Substituted Judgment\nstandard whenever possible and fall back on the Best Interests\nstandard only when we lack sufficient information about the patient's\nprior wishes and values to make Substituted Judgment practicable.\n\n\nBy contrast, for the \u201cnever-been competent\u201d patients, the\nSubstituted Judgment standard does not seem applicable (e.g., Cantor 2005):\nif the patient has never been able to make autonomous decisions in\ncircumstances such as the current one, it seems impossible to\nreconstruct what the patient's decision would have been. For these\npatients, the Best Interests standard is the only option.\n\n\nWhen combined, these orthodox views generate one unified simple\nordering of priority among the several standards and mechanisms for\nsurrogate decision-making, an ordering found in answers to Q2 and Q2a\nprevailing in the literature (e.g., Brock 1995):\n\nHonor a substantive advance directive, as an aid to Substituted\nJudgment, whenever such directive is available.\nAbsent\nan advance directive, apply the Substituted Judgment standard based on\navailable information about the patient's past decisions and\nvalues.\nIf you cannot apply the Substituted Judgment standard \u2014 either because\nthe patient has never been competent or because information about the\npatient's former wishes and values is unavailable \u2014 use the Best\nInterests standard.\n\n\n\nIs this orthodox view correct?\n2. Challenges to the orthodox view regarding the never competent\n\n\nConcerning patients who have never been competent, the orthodox view,\nas it is typically interpreted, may be misleading in certain cases. By\nrecommending the Best Interests standard as opposed to the Substituted\nJudgment standard, the orthodox view may help create the impression\nthat, for those who have never had decision-making capacity, only a\none-size-fits-all objective assessment of their interests, based on\ngeneric goals such as prolonging life or avoiding pain, is\navailable. However, a person may lack decision-making capacity but\nnonetheless possess the proper starting points of decision-making, so\nthat a surrogate could still reconstruct deeply personal and\nidiosyncratic choices on the person's behalf. Consider a child or a\nmildly retarded patient who lacks the capacity to make a sophisticated\nmedical decision because she cannot fully grasp the complex\nconsequences of the available options, or because, if left to her own\ndevices, she would merely choose impulsively. Yet, very meaningful and\npersonally distinctive issues may be at stake for this individual: for\ninstance, alternative treatments may differently impact her\nrelationships with loved ones or differently affect her ability to\ncontinue participating in deeply valued activities such as painting or\ndancing. In such cases, to best serve the interests of the patient,\nsurrogates arguably need to reconstruct the subjective point of view\nof the patient, and not just fall back on generic choices that\n\u201ca reasonable person\u201d would make under the\ncircumstances. In short, sometimes \u2014 especially in dealing with\npatients with rich inner lives whose decision-making is nevertheless\nimpaired \u2014 the application of the Best Interests standard may\nlook an awful lot like an exercise of Substituted Judgment.\n\n\nIt is only with regards to patients who do not even possess the\nstarting points of decisions \u2014 for example, infants or more severely\nbrain damaged individuals \u2014 that the idea of reconstructing the\nindividual's own point of view as a basis for a decision does not even\ncoherently apply, and the more generic application of the Best\nInterests standard is called for.\n\n\nNonetheless, this is only a challenge to the narrow way in which the\nBest Interests standard has typically been employed: a more nuanced\ninterpretation of the orthodox view can handle the cases of the\nnever-competent appropriately. The application of Best Interests can,\nin many instances, procedurally resemble the application of\nSubstituted Judgment because, on any reasonable theory of\n well-being,\na large part of what counts as good for a person is attaining what she\nvalues or succeeding in what she cares about. It is thus not\nsurprising that reconstructing the individual's viewpoint is an\nimportant part of a nuanced interpretation of Best Interests. Yet,\neven though in employing the Best Interests standard one usually must\ntake very seriously the subject's own viewpoint, one is not thereby\nrecreating the autonomous choice the person would have made. This is\nparticularly clear for those who have never been competent: one cannot\nbe respecting their autonomy (at least not on the usual understanding\nof autonomous choice), since they have never had autonomy. Moreover,\neven in undertaking to respect their \"starting points of\ndecision-making,\" one would not treat these starting points as\nentirely decisive. An individual who has never been competent may\nvalue something that would be terribly destructive to her other values\n(and be incapable of realizing this), and so, to protect her, the Best\nInterests standard would have to focus on those other values. So here\nagain the application of the Best Interests standard diverges from\nwhat would most plausibly count as a reconstruction of the subject's\nown autonomous choice. Given that Substituted Judgment is grounded in\nrespect for autonomy, it is thus clear why, according to the orthodox\nview, Substituted Judgment makes no sense for the never-competent, and\nwhy the orthodox view prescribes for them the Best Interests standard,\nalbeit interpreted in a suitably broad way.\n\n \nAs already noted, different views on how to apply the Best Interests\nstandard roughly correspond to different theories of\n well-being.  \nHowever, theories of well-being are normally developed with an\nordinary fully-capacitated human being in mind, so, when applied to\nthose whose incompetence is due, in part, to substantial deviations\nfrom this paradigm, some theories need to be adjusted to accommodate\nhuman beings who do not at the time, or ever, possess the paradigm\ncapacities these theories presume (for example, the capacity to\nexperience the pleasures of the intellect, or the capacity to\ndesire). The understanding of well-being and the specifics of applying\nthe Best Interests standard in such cases must be tailored to the\ndetails of each particular real-life condition \u2014 and to the\ncorresponding levels of mental functioning.  Interests of children,\nincluding infants, have received some attention in the literature\n(Buchanan and Brock 1990, ch.5, Schapiro 1999); similar tailor-made\nanalyses are needed for individual mental illnesses and brain\ndeficits.\n3. Conflicts across time in the formerly competent\n\nThe orthodox view regarding the formerly competent faces deeper\nchallenges. In giving priority to Advance Directives and Substituted\nJudgment, the orthodox view overlooks the possibility that the earlier\ncompetent self and the current incompetent self may have conflicting\ninterests. Advance Directives and Substituted Judgment are best suited\nfor the contexts for which they were first developed in the law\n\u2014 conditions involving loss of consciousness such as persistent\nvegetative state \u2014 where the patient in the current incompetent\nstate cannot have interests potentially different from the interests\nof the person he used to be. However, loss of decision-making capacity\noften comes about in less drastic, yet permanent conditions, which can\nleave the current incompetent patient with what seem to be powerful\nnew interests in his new phase of life. Classic cases of this sort\noccur in Alzheimer's disease, other forms of dementia, and\nstroke. Before the loss of capacity, typically, the patient had\nnumerous interests associated with his rich mental life and with a\ncorrespondingly complex set of values. Once mental deterioration\nprogresses, the patient's universe of interests shrinks and new\ninterests may become dominant. Sometimes the two sets of interests can\ncome into conflict. Imagine, for example, a fully competent patient\nwho, in anticipation of developing Alzheimer's disease, espouses a\nstrong conviction, perhaps documented in an advance directive, that\nshe does not wish to have her life prolonged in a demented state. She\ndeeply identifies with her intellect, and thus views life with\ndementia as terribly degrading. But once she develops dementia, her\nidentification with her intellect drops out as a concern, so she loses\nthe corresponding desire not to prolong her life. In the meantime, she\nis still capable of simple enjoyments \u2014 she likes gardening or\nlistening to music \u2014 and perhaps can even carry on meaningful\nhuman attachments. Her current, truncated set of interests does seem\nto favor continued life. Such scenarios raise difficult questions of\nhow the interests of the earlier and current self ought to be balanced\nin surrogate decision-making. Privileging advance directives and\nrecreating the judgment of the earlier self via substituted judgment\nare no longer the obvious solutions, given this conflict.\n\nMuch of the philosophical literature on surrogate decision-making has\nfocused on conflicts of this kind. There are subtle differences,\nthough, in how this conflict is conceptualized \u2014 more\nspecifically, in how the interests of the earlier self are viewed\n\u2014 sometimes stemming from differences in what is taken as a\nparadigm example of the conflict. On one view, the relevant interests\nof the earlier self are autonomy interests: what matters is that the\nchoices of the earlier self be heeded. With this emphasis, the\nconflict is between the autonomy of the earlier self and the\nwell-being of the current self. On an alternative conception, the\ninterests of the earlier self are well-being interests: what matters\nis that the earlier self fares well overall. The conflict, then, is\nbetween the well-being of the earlier self and the well-being of the\ncurrent self. One may also consider both aspects of the conflict as\nrelevant. The arguments below apply to all three interpretations of\nthe conflict.\n3.1 Threshold of authority approach\n\n\nOne way to rescue the idea that the former self and its interests\nought to have priority is to appeal to the special authority\nof the former self over the current self. The grounds of this authority\nare cashed out differently in different views, but the basic thought is\nthat the former self's superior capacities give her standing to govern\nthe current self. Once the current self falls below a certain threshold\nof capacity, her interests in her current state are so marginal as to\nno longer be authoritative for how she ought to be cared for, and the\ninterests of the earlier self trump.\n\nSeveral lines of argument have been used to establish the authority of\nthe earlier self over the current self. One is to deny altogether the\nindependence of the current self's interests. On this interpretation,\nthe conflict described above is merely apparent. Once the current self\nfalls below the relevant threshold of capacity, she is incapable of\ngenerating her own independent interests, and, despite superficial\nappearances to the contrary, her fundamental interests are really\ndefined by the earlier self. The interests of the current self are\nstraightforwardly not authoritative since they are merely apparent\ninterests. Further, even were we to accept that the current self has\nher own independent interests, there are other reasons to see those\ninterests as lacking authority. If one insists on the priority of\nrespect for autonomy over beneficence, or if one views the capacity\nfor autonomy as the essential core of a person, the interests of the\nearlier self will be seen as having authority over the current self\nbecause only the earlier self is capable of autonomy. Ronald Dworkin's\nanalysis combines all of these lines of argument (Dworkin 1993).\n\nDifferent versions of the threshold approach propose somewhat\ndifferent thresholds for when the current interests of a formerly\ncompetent individual cease to be authoritative. It is usually accepted\nthat the mere loss of decision-making capacity is insufficient\n(Dworkin 1993, 222-29).  Decision-making capacity is context-specific\nand depends on the complexity of the pertinent information that the\ndecision-maker needs to process. A person may lose the ability to make\nvery complex medical decisions, while still being able to decide\nperfectly well about simpler everyday matters. Lapses of this nature\nwould not give the surrogate a license to discount the current\nwell-being of the individual in favor of what mattered to him\nearlier. By contrast, transformations that could leave authority with\nthe past self must involve a more global loss of capacity such that\none can no longer generate, in any context, interests of a special,\nmorally weighty type.  In crossing this threshold, one ceases to be a\nbeing of a certain morally privileged kind: for instance, one ceases\nto be an autonomous individual, or one turns from a person into a\nnonperson. If an autonomous individual loses his capacity for autonomy\naltogether \u2014 the thought then goes \u2014 he may have some\nlocal (possibly merely illusory) interests associated with the\nnon-autonomous self, but his affairs ought to be conducted in\naccordance with his earlier wishes expressive of his autonomy. Or, in\nthe parallel version, if a person turns into a nonperson, he may have\nsome local (possibly illusory) interests as a nonperson, but his\naffairs ought to be conducted so as to advance the interests of the\nperson he used to be.\n\nWithin this basic framework, several variants are possible, depending\non what one takes to be the essential characteristics of a person, or,\nif one accepts the capacity for autonomy as the essence of personhood,\ndepending on what one takes to be the core aspects of autonomy.\nRonald Dworkin's influential work defends the capacity for autonomy as\nthe relevant threshold, with autonomy interpreted as \u201cthe\nability to act out of genuine preference or character or conviction or\na sense of self\u201d (Dworkin 1993, 225). If an individual has lost\nthe capacity for autonomy so understood, this view dictates that her\ncurrent interests (illusory or not) have no authority over decisions\non her behalf, and surrogates ought to cater to her former interests,\nfrom before the loss.\n\n\nIt is, however, important to notice that the capacity for autonomy, as\ninterpreted by Dworkin, comprises two distinct abilities: (1) the\nability to espouse a \u201cgenuine preference or character or\nconviction or a sense of self\u201d \u2014 what may be called, for\nshort, the ability to value \u2014 and (2) the ability to act out of\none's sense of conviction, that is, the ability to enact one's values\nin the complex circumstances of the real world. In many brain\ndisorders these two abilities come apart. For example, a patient in\nthe middle stages of Alzheimer's disease may retain genuine values\n\u2014 she may hold on to family ties or to the conviction that\nhelping others is good\u00ad \u2014 and yet, due to a rapid\ndeterioration of short-term memory, she may be perpetually confused\nand unable to figure out how to enact these values in the concrete\ncircumstances of her life. The set of values such a patient retains\nwould typically be a curtailment of the original set, introducing the\npotential for conflict between the interests of the earlier and\ncurrent self. For example, earlier, the person may have valued\nindependence above all else, and so was adamantly against having her\nlife prolonged if she developed Alzheimer's disease. Now, in moderate\nstages of Alzheimer's, she has lost her commitment to independence,\nbut still values emotional connections to family members, and thus has\na strong interest in continuing to live. On Dworkin's approach to\ndecisions on this individual's behalf, her current interests are not\nallowed to override her earlier interests because she has lost her\nstanding as an autonomous agent: due to her confusion, she is unable\nto act on her commitment to the family ties or on any other values\n\u2014 she is unable to run her life by her own lights, that is, to\ngovern herself. However, on an alternative view (Jaworska 1999), what\nmatters most for autonomy and personhood are the starting points of\nautonomous decision-making: the genuine values that the person still\nholds. So long as an individual is capable of valuing, she remains a\nbeing of a morally privileged type, and interests stemming from her\nvalues have the authority to dictate how the individual ought to be\ntreated. The person need not be able to enact her values on her own\n\u2014 it is part of the surrogate's role to assist with this\ntask. In short, on this alternative view, the capacity to value marks\nthe morally crucial threshold above which the current interests of a\nformerly competent individual remain authoritative for the surrogate's\ndecisions and the conflicting interests of the earlier self can be set\naside.\n\n\nThe two views I have just discussed share the underlying idea of a\nthreshold of capacity beyond which an individual's current interests\nlose authority. This idea has been challenged in several ways.\n3.2 Challenge I: Appeal to the forward-looking perspective of decision-making\n\n\nThe most straightforward challenge emphasizes that decision-making\ninherently involves a present- and future-oriented perspective: the\nsurrogate must make the best decision for the patient in front of him\nabout how to manage this patient's life from now on. The patient may\nhave had different interests in the past, but how can these be\nrelevant to current decisions, which can only affect the present and\nfuture but not the past? This approach may accept it as unfortunate\nthat the patient's past interests were left unfulfilled, but insists\nthat this unfortunate fact cannot be remedied, and that there is no\nuse in catering to bygone interests in current decision-making\n(Dresser 1986).\n\n\nAn advocate of the threshold view, such as Dworkin, would emphasize\ntwo points in response:\n\n\nFirst, past interests can often be satisfied in the present. Dworkin\ndistinguishes between what he calls \u201cexperiential\u201d and\n\u201ccritical\u201d interests (Dworkin 1993, 201-08). Experiential\ninterests are, roughly, interests in having desirable felt\nexperiences, such as enjoyment (and in avoiding undesirable\nexperiences, such as boredom). These interests are indeed tied to the\npresent: there is no point in trying to satisfy one's past\nexperiential interest in a specific enjoyment (for instance, in\nplaying with dolls), if one at present has no hope of still deriving\nenjoyment from what one used to enjoy in the past. By contrast,\ncritical interests are not tied to the experience of their\nsatisfaction; these are interests in having what one values or cares\nabout become a reality, such as a parent's interest in the success and\nprosperity of his child or a sailor's interest in preserving his\nbeautiful wooden boat. According to Dworkin, such interests can be\nmeaningfully satisfied even if they belong in the past: for example,\neven after the sailor dies, it makes sense to preserve the boat he\ncared about and do so for his sake. Similarly, according to Dworkin,\nit makes sense to satisfy a formerly competent person's critical\ninterests, such as the interest in avoiding the indignity of dementia,\nfor her sake, even if she has ceased to understand those critical\ninterests now.\n\n\nSecond, on a view like Dworkin's, the past critical interests of an\nindividual who formerly possessed the capacity for autonomy are, in a\ncrucial sense, still her interests in the present, even if she can no\nlonger take an interest in them. This is an essential element of the\nclaim that the patient's earlier autonomous self has authority over\nher current non-autonomous self. The thought is this. For any person,\nthe interests she has autonomously defined for herself are her most\nimportant interests. And this is so even for an individual who has\nlost her capacity for autonomy or her personhood: so long as the\nindividual survives the loss as numerically the same entity, her\ninterests stemming from autonomy (or the subset of them that can still\nbe satisfied) remain her most important interests, even if she can't\nespouse them now, and they are, in this sense, \u201cpast.\u201d\nThus, Dworkin offers a powerful rationale for why satisfying\n\u201cpast\u201d interests can still matter, and matter very deeply,\nin the present.\n3.3 Challenge II: Exercise of will as the point of autonomy\n\n\nThe versions of the threshold view that see the capacity for autonomy\nas the relevant threshold can be challenged by approaches that cast\nthe requirements of the capacity for autonomy as being so minimal\nthat any individual capable of generating independent\ninterests in his deteriorated state counts as autonomous. On such\napproaches, conflicts between earlier interests grounded in autonomy\nand later interests no longer so grounded become impossible, and the\nclaim of authority of the earlier autonomous self over the current\nnon-autonomous self loses its bite: the threshold of autonomy is so\nlow as to cease to mark any contestable difference in authority. Seana\nShiffrin's response to Dworkin can be interpreted as a view of this\nsort (Shiffrin 2004). Shiffrin sees a key point of autonomy in the\nability to exercise one's own will: the ability to control one's\nexperiences through the enactment of one's own choice. Shiffrin\nemphasizes that so long as an individual has this ability, its\nexercise calls for protection, and this is a crucial part of what we\nprotect when we respect autonomy. On this picture, so long as an\nindividual is able to make choices, have preferences, exhibit a will,\netc., there is a rationale for catering to his current interests, and\nso his current interests have authority to override interests espoused\nin the past.\n\n\nThe proponent of the threshold view may, in response, acknowledge\nthe importance of the ability to control one's experience through acts\nof will, but still insist that a more robust capacity for autonomy \u2014\nfor example, a capacity that involves expression of values and not just\nmere preferences \u2014 has moral importance of an altogether different\norder. This difference can then support the position that, in cases of\nconflicts between an earlier self capable of such robust autonomy and a\ncurrent self merely capable of exercises of will, the earlier self\nretains authority and her interests ought to be heeded.\n3.4 Challenge III: Loss of personal identity\n\n\nAccording to the threshold views, the earlier self has authority to\ndetermine the overall interests of the patient because the current\nself has lost crucial abilities that would allow it to ground these\noverall interests anew. This picture assumes that the earlier and\ncurrent self are stages in the life of one entity, so that, despite\nthe talk of local interests associated with each life-stage, there is\nan underlying continuity of interests between the two. But this is a\nvery substantial assumption, and it has been contested by appeal to an\ninfluencial account of the metaphysics of\n personal identity\n over time, the psychological continuity account. Roughly,\nthe idea is that, in the wake of a drastic transformation of one's\npsychology such as Alzheimer's disease, one does not survive as\nnumerically the same individual, so whatever interests one's\npredecessor in one's body may have had are not a suitable basis for\ndecisions on behalf of the new individual who has emerged after the\ntransformation (Dresser 1986). The lack of identity between the earlier\nand current self undercuts the authority of the former over the\nlatter.\n\n\nThis approach works best in cases in which we can assume that the\nnew entity emerging after the psychological transformation is still a\nperson: the interests of the earlier self cannot dictate how the\ncurrent self ought to be treated because it would be a clear violation\nof the rights of persons to allow one person to usurp the affairs of\nanother. (Some may doubt whether loss of numerical identity without\nloss of personhood is even possible in any real-life cases of dementia\nor brain damage, but the theoretical point still holds.) What, though,\nif the psychological deterioration is indeed severe enough to strip the\nresulting entity of the capacities of a person?\n\n\nSome might see the loss of personhood as a particularly clear-cut\nsign of a change in numerical identity: if the current self is not even\na person, surely the current self cannot be the same person as the\nearlier self. However, as David DeGrazia has emphasized, this line of\nreasoning rests on an undefended (and controversial) assumption that we\nare essentially persons (DeGrazia 1999). For if we are not essentially\npersons \u2014 but, rather, for example, conscious minds of some other,\nless complex kind \u2014 an individual may very well lose the properties of\na person without any threat to his numerical survival.\n\n\nNonetheless, even if we are not essentially persons, on the\npsychological view of our identity, we are essentially defined by our\npsychological properties. If these properties change drastically\nenough, the old individual ceases to exist and a new individual comes\ninto existence. And the transformation of a person into a nonperson\ndoes seem to be a drastic psychological transformation. Thus, even if\nDeGrazia is right that loss of numerical identity does not\nautomatically follow from loss of personhood, it is certainly\npossible, and perhaps even likely, on the psychological view of our\nidentity, that a transformation of a person into a nonperson would\ninvolve such a profound psychological alteration as to result in a\nnumerically new being. How should we adjudicate conflicts between the\nearlier and the current individual in such cases?\n\n\nOn one view, if a person turns into a new individual in the later\nstages of dementia, this by itself undercuts the authority of the\nearlier person over her successor, regardless of whether the successor\nis a person or not. After all, why should an altogether different\nindividual dictate how the current self is to be treated? However, more\nnuanced positions can also be found in the literature. Buchanan and\nBrock (1990) see the authority of the earlier self in cases of loss of\nnumerical identity as crucially dependent on whether the current self\nis still a person. They accept that if the current self is a person, it\nwould be a violation of her rights as a person to allow another\nindividual to commandeer her affairs. However, if the current self is\nno longer a person, he lacks the same rights. And, as Buchanan and\nBrock see it, the earlier self has \u201csomething like a property\nright\u2026 to determine what happens to [his] nonperson successor\u201d\n(166). That is, if one ceases to exist by turning into a nonperson, one\nretains a quasi-property right to control the resulting nonperson,\npresumably in much the same way that, when one ceases to exist by\nturning into a corpse, one has a quasi-property right to control the\nresulting corpse. Hence, on this approach, even if the earlier and\ncurrent self are distinct individuals, the earlier self has the\nauthority to determine what happens to the current self, so long as the\ncurrent self has been stripped of personhood. In this way, the idea of\na threshold of capacity beyond which the earlier self gains authority\nto dictate the current self's affairs is resurrected, despite the\nassumption that the earlier and current self are not the same\nindividual. But, this time, the basis of the authority is different: it\nis not grounded in the continuity of overall interests between the two\nselves, but rather in the earlier self's quasi-property right. Note,\nthough, that the claim that quasi-property rights could extend to\nrights over successors who are nonetheless conscious beings is\ncontroversial and requires further defense.\n3.5 Challenge IV: Severance of prudential concern\n\n\nIt is possible to retain the intuitive idea that the weakness of\npsychological connections between the two selves undermines the\nauthority of the earlier self over the current self without accepting\nthe metaphysical view that the earlier and current self are numerically\ndistinct entities. Suppose we maintain that even the most drastic\nmental deterioration is not equivalent to death \u2014 that the same\nindividual persists through the ravages of Alzheimer's disease. We can\nstill question the continuity of interest between the earlier and\ncurrent self by examining the concern the earlier and current self\nwould appropriately have for one another (McMahan 2002).\n\n\nOrdinarily, each of us has a very unique type of concern for our own\npast and future selves: it matters to you, in a very special way, what\nhappens to you, what experiences you undergo, how\nyou act, etc., now, in the future, and in the past. Call this\nspecial species of concern prudential concern. We normally\nassume that prudential concern strictly tracks personal identity: one\nhas prudential concern only for oneself and one is always concerned\nwith oneself in this way. By contrast, Jeff McMahan has argued that (at\nleast within the bounds of numerical identity) prudential concern also\nought to track the degree of psychological ties: prudential concern of\ntwo selves at different stages of life for one another ought to weaken\nin proportion to the weakness of the psychological connection between\nthem (McMahan 2002, 69-82). In the context of the severe psychological\ntransformations caused by a disease like Alzheimer's, this means that\nthe appropriate level of prudential concern of the earlier and current\nself for one another would be rather slight. The two selves are not\nbound by a sufficiently strong common prudential interest, and so the\nperson's earlier interests, no matter how important, do not transfer as\nparticularly important interests of her current psychologically\ndisconnected self. Any potential conflicts between the interests of the\ntwo selves are now akin to conflicts between two entities with\naltogether independent interests.\n\n\nDavid DeGrazia has tried to counter this picture by suggesting that,\nin addition to the factors discussed by McMahan, the earlier self's\nappropriate degree of prudential concern for the current self can be\nboosted by the earlier self's autonomously formed self-narrative: if\nthe earlier self identified with the current self, in the sense of\nseeing the current self as a true stage in the unfolding complex\nnarrative of her life, strong prudential concern is warranted (DeGrazia\n2005, 196). Oddly, this view makes the rational level of prudential\nconcern for the future partly a matter of choice of the earlier self.\nYet, unlike our ordinary concerns for specific plans, projects, other\npeople, etc., which are up to us, prudential concern is a requirement\nof rationality and should not be a matter of choice. Just as we cannot\nrationally have prudential concern for someone else simply because we\nhappen to incorporate (perhaps delusionally) their life into our\nself-narrative, similarly, if we are not otherwise warranted to have\nprudential concern for our own future self, we cannot change this\nsimply by virtue of how we happen to construct our self-narrative.\n\n\nReturn, then, to McMahan's picture. If the interests of the earlier\nand current self are genuinely prudentially estranged and independent,\nhow should we resolve conflicts between them?\n\n\nWhen the current self is still a person, her rights as a person call\nfor allowing her interests to control her treatment and against letting\nthe interests of the earlier self interfere; any weakness in the\ncurrent self's prudential connection to the earlier self merely\nreinforces this stance. But how should we balance the interests of the\ntwo prudentially estranged selves when the current self is not a\nperson?\n\n\nMcMahan himself suggests that, in a conflict between an earlier person\nand a current nonperson, the interests of the earlier person ought to\ntrump (McMahan 2002, 502-03). He emphasizes that the earlier self is a\n\u201chigher self,\u201d \u201crational and autonomous,\u201d and\nthat her interests are associated with the dominant, more substantial\nand lengthy part of life, integrated \u2014 through strong prudential\nconnections among its various stages \u2014 into one unified life-segment.\nBut part of McMahan's reasoning is also that the interests of the\ncurrent nonperson are, as types of interests, not very substantial.\nHere McMahan relies on the specifics of the example of conflict he\nhappens to analyze (a version of the \u201cpreference to die\u201d\nexample we saw earlier), together with a controversial claim that a\nseverely demented patient would not have a strong interest in\ncontinuing to live.\n\n\nWhile McMahan may be right that strong interests of an earlier\nperson trump comparatively trivial interests of a current nonperson,\nhis answer covers only a subset of possible conflicts between the\nearlier and current self. It is much more difficult to arbitrate\nbetween the two selves when the interests of the current nonperson are\nalso substantial. I have argued (Jaworska unpublished) that when the\ninterests of the earlier person are relatively minor, substantial\ninterests of the current nonperson ought to trump. Thus, for example,\nif the earlier self had only a relatively weak preference to die \u2014\nlet's say she simply didn't want to further complicate relationships\nwith family members for whom she happened not to care all that much \u2014\nthe current self's substantial interest in continuing to live ought to\nprevail. More controversially, I also argued that highly vital\ninterests of the current nonperson ought to trump even some\nnon-trivial, rather serious interests of the earlier person. Thus, in\nthe standard version of the \u201cpreference to die\u201d scenario, what is\nat stake for the earlier self is a rather serious interest in\nmaintaining the integrity of her life narrative. However, this interest\ndoes not reach the level of high vitality, because there is only so\nmuch damage that a period of senility at the end of a life can do to an\notherwise successful life-narrative. By contrast, the current self's\ninterest in her very survival is more highly vital. It is also, unlike\nthe earlier self's interest, an active interest \u2014 an ongoing subject\nof interests has reason to be strongly prudentially invested in it.\nThese factors combined lend, in this scenario, priority to the interest\nof the current self.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Brock, D., 1995, \u201cDeath and Dying: Euthanasia and Sustaining\nLife: Ethical Issues,\u201d in <em>Encyclopedia of Bioethics</em> (Volume\n1), W.
