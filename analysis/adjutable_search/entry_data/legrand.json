    "preamble": "\n\nAntoine Le Grand (1629\u20131699) was a philosopher and catholic\ntheologian who played an important role in propagating the Cartesian\nphilosophy in England and beyond during the latter half of the\nseventeenth century. He was born in Douai, (at the time under rule by\nthe Spanish Hapsburgs), and early in life was associated with an\nEnglish community of Franciscans who had a college there. Le Grand\nbecame a Franciscan Recollect friar prior to leaving for England as a\nmissionary in 1656. In England, he taught philosophy and theology,\nadvocating Catholicism and eventually Cartesianism, the latter being\nas unpopular as the former was perilous. It is not clear how Le Grand\ncame to Cartesianism, but the first evidence of his adoption of the\nnew philosophy was in his Institutio Philosophiae, published\nin London in 1672. His early works show affinities to the philosophies\nof Seneca and Epicurus. He is noted for his polemical exchanges with\nSamuel Parker and John Sergeant, and for having given\nDescartes\u2019s work a Scholastic form to further its acceptance in\nthe schools.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Writings\n\nLe Grand lived in London for many years before retiring to Oxfordshire\ntowards the close of his life in 1695. His philosophy was generally\nwell-received at the University of Cambridge, perhaps owing to the\ninfluence of some leading Neo-Platonists there such as John Smith,\nHenry More, and Ralph Cudworth, who were at least initially\nsympathetic to Descartes\u2019s ideas. John Smith, author of\nSelect Discourses (1660), and the earliest recorded partisan\nof the Cartesian philosophy in England, was the first to introduce the\nstudy of Descartes to Cambridge. Henry More corresponded with\nDescartes, and was sympathetic until about 1665, when he launched the\nmost vigorous attack on Cartesianism in the age, in his\nEnchiridion Metaphysicum (1671). Cudworth, like More although\nwith less venom, objected to Descartes\u2019s mechanistic account of\nthe material world in his The True Intellectual System of the\nUniverse (1678). It was Le Grand who debated and defended\nDescartes\u2019s philosophy to these and other English critics.\n\nAccording to Anthony Wood, a contemporary of Le Grand\u2019s and an\nhistorian at Oxford, Le Grand\u2019s Institutio Philosophiae,\nsecundum principia Domini Renati Descartes (1672), was a\n\u201cmust read\u201d at Cambridge. (Wood, 1691, p. 620) Further\nattesting to the attention it attracted, Jean Robert Armogathe has\ndetailed how the 1678 edition of this work came to be placed on the\nIndex in 1709 because of its anti-scholastic arguments. (Armogathe,\n2003) Le Grand also published a Latin edition of Jacques\nRohault\u2019s Trait\u00e9 de physique (1671), at the time\nan enormously popular physics text, using Bonet\u2019s 1674 Latin\ntranslation with added commentary, Jacobi Rohaulti tractatus\nphysicus (1682). In 1697, Samuel Clarke published a new Latin\nedition with annotations, and this along with subsequent annotated\neditions were largely responsible for the work\u2019s continued\npopularity as a textbook in universities in England. (Dobre,\nBabe\u0219, Bujor, and Vida, 2021) According to Benjamin Hoadly, the\neditor of Clarke\u2019s The Works (1738), at the time of\nClarke\u2019s entrance to Cambridge in 1691, Rohault\u2019s\nTrait\u00e9 was the standard modern scientific text, and\nNewton\u2019s Principia (1687), had not yet been accepted:\n\u201cThe philosophy of Des Cartes was then the established\nphilosophy of that university, and the system of nature hardly allowed\nto be explained any otherwise than his principles \u2026 . The Great\nSir Isaac Newton had indeed then published his Principia. But\nthis book was but for the few.\u201d Clarke\u2019s Latin translation\nof the Trait\u00e9 underwent four editions and became the\nnew preferred Cambridge textbook, as the Cartesian physics gave way to\nthat of Newton early in the eighteenth century.\n\nAntoine Le Grand\u2019s most substantial work, An Entire Body of\nPhilosophy According to the Principles Of the Famous Renate des\nCartes (1694), is a Cartesian tract from beginning to end. The\nwork is a translation and compilation by Richard Bloom of three of Le\nGrand\u2019s Latin works, which includes alterations and additions by\nLe Grand himself. It is based on Le Grand\u2019s Institutio\n(1672), Historia naturae (1673), and Dissertatio de\ncarentia sensus et cogitationis in brutis (1675). The first book,\nThe Institution, is divided into ten parts and provides a\ntreatment of the general nature of things according to\nDescartes\u2019s principles; book two, The History of\nNature, illustrates the operation of these first principles in\nnature, by means of a great variety of reported experiments and\nexamples. In this book, Le Grand applied the general Cartesian\nprinciples to the study of particular bodies and their qualities,\nshowing how such principles can explain all natural phenomena. His\nextensive discussion includes bodies as various as the loadstone,\nplants, and insects. And finally, in the third book, A\nDissertation of the Want of Sense and Knowledge in Brute Animals,\nhe argued against the supposed link of life and sense from Plato\nonwards. Following a brief survey of various hypotheses on the nature\nof soul by Aristotle, Gassendi, Fabri, and Descartes, he argues along\nwith Descartes that bodies are soulless and animals are mere machines.\nIn the Preface, Le Grand states, \u201c \u2026 this whole work\ncontains nothing else, but his [Descartes\u2019s] opinions, or what\nmay clearly and distinctly be deduced from them.\u201d (Le Grand,\n1694, Preface, end of section iii, unpaginated)\n\nAt Oxford, Le Grand\u2019s ideas were not well received. Samuel\nParker aligned Hobbes\u2019s mechanism with that of Descartes,\ncharging both with atheism. Parker\u2019s condemnations led to the\nbanning of Descartes\u2019s philosophy at Oxford, quashing its public\nentrance at the university. Le Grand responded to Parker\u2019s\ncharges of atheism in his Apologia de Descartes (1679),\nchallenging Parker\u2019s criticisms by offering various proofs of\nGod\u2019s existence. Another long-time, Oxford critic of Le Grand\nwas the English secular priest and Aristotelian, John Sergeant.\nSergeant, best known for his criticisms of Locke\u2019s philosophy,\nwas also highly critical of the Cartesian philosophy. Le Grand\nresponded to Sergeant\u2019s criticisms of the Cartesian criterion of\ntruth in his Dissertatio de ratione cognoscendi (1679). A\nsecond major controversy occurred between the two authors late in Le\nGrand\u2019s life, this time over the nature of ideas. This dispute\nled Le Grand to write a series of short pieces, published later as\nSeveral Smaller Pieces Against M. J. Sergeant (1698), no\nlonger extant. (Bouillier, 1854, vol. 2, p. 495, fn.1) In response,\nSergeant attacked the Cartesian idea of extension, to which the aging\nLe Grand never publicly responded. Le Grand died at the home of a\nwealthy farmer in Oxfordshire, where he had served as a tutor until\nhis death in 1699.\n2. Metaphysics and Natural Philosophy\n\nLe Grand defended the first principles of Descartes\u2019s philosophy\nwith great fidelity. He held to Descartes\u2019s dualism of mind and\nbody and that the essence of mind is thought and the essence of matter\nis extension. Like Descartes, he also asserted that in the human being\nthe mind and body are united and interact, and that while humans have\nsouls, brutes and other living things are mere machines. In natural\nphilosophy, Le Grand defended the Cartesian physics that material\nthings operate in a plenum and move by means of vortical motions\naccording to the laws of motion. Le Grand did not make any substantial\nrevisions to Cartesian metaphysics or physics. However, he did make\ntwo important contributions: first, he provided clarifications and\nelaborations of Descartes\u2019s account of motion which had direct\nconsequences for the Cartesian account of matter, causation, and\nmind-body interaction; secondly, he extended the application of\nCartesian physics, treating in detail such subjects as metals, plants,\ninsects, animals, and the human body. Both contributions represented\nimportant developments of the Cartesian science, against the\nprevailing Scholastic-Aristotelian science.\n\nLe Grand\u2019s contribution to the Cartesian account of motion may\neither be seen as an extension or a revision of Descartes\u2019s,\nsomewhat ambiguous, treatment. Le Grand took seriously the claim that\nGod is the total and efficient cause of motion in the universe, and\nthat matter is entirely passive, and hence bodies are incapable of\nself-movement, or of moving other bodies. In his Entire Body of\nPhilosophy, he argued that since a body may be in motion or at\nrest and yet still remain a body, motion must be a mode non-essential\nto matter. Moreover, given that matter itself is inert, it cannot be\nthe source of the order and direction of moving bodies. Accordingly,\nGod infused motion into the universe and laid down the laws of motion\nto govern it. Thus, motion itself as well as the orderly movement of\nbodies derive from God who acts as the effective principle. While the\nspecific position, constitution, and configuration of the parts of a\nparticular body determine how certain local motions are communicated,\nthe source and ultimate direction of the motion itself is God. What\nthis means for body-body interaction is that bodies function as\nsecondary causes, directing local motions in virtue of the specific\nconfigurations of their parts. (1694, Book I, part iv, p. 116) Kenneth\nClatterbaugh argues that Le Grand\u2019s position on body-body\ncausation amounts to occasionalism. Clatterbaugh identifies four\npositions that he claims commit Le Grand to the occasionalist doctrine\narticulated by Malebranche: 1) that there are no accidents; 2) that\nmotion is identical to the will of God; 3) that conservation and\ncreation are the same such that God creates bodies and their motions\ncontinuously; and 4) that the Divine Will and Intellect are one.\n(Clatterbaugh, 1999) However, Le Grand\u2019s references to universal\nand secondary causes, and his commitment to the created nature of laws\nand eternal truths make the occasionalist ascription a complicated\none. (See discussion of the Creation Doctrine below in section 3.)\n\nLe Grand\u2019s account of body-body interaction clears the way to\nexplain mind-body interaction and union. In the same way as with\nfinite bodies, God functions as the effective principle of finite\nminds, providing the ultimate source of change: \u201c\u2026 there\nis nothing, besides motion, which can strike the organs of the senses,\nor affect the mind itself.\u201d (1694, book I, part viii, p. 284)\nAlthough mind and matter are substances sharing no common properties,\nit is in virtue of God acting as the effective principle that mind and\nbody are capable of interaction. This kind of interaction is no more\nor no less problematic than the interaction of two physical bodies.\nAccording to Le Grand, the causal interaction between bodies and\nbetween minds and bodies are facts dependent upon God\u2019s will and\nknown only by experience. The real question is not about whether there\ncan be interaction, but rather, how particular interactions in fact\noccur: \u201cThe union of the soul and body consists in an actual\ndependency of all the cogitations of the soul, upon certain motions of\nthe body; and of some certain motions of the body upon some\ncogitations of the soul.\u201d (1694, book I, part xi, p. 325) As\nthere is no mode of union of mind and body (for modes belong only to\nsubstances), what is required is the actual \u201cmutual commerce of\nactions and passions.\u201d (Ibid., p. 325)\n\nAs with interaction, Le Grand described the mind-body union in terms\ndirectly borrowed from Descartes. However, Le Grand explicated in more\ndetailed terms than did Descartes the nature of the mind-body union.\nAccording to Le Grand, there are three kinds of union, each possessing\ntheir own principle that brings about that union: the first is that of\ntwo minds whose principle of union is love; the second is that of two\nphysical bodies whose principle of union is local presence; and the\nthird is that of the mind and body whose principle of union is actual\nmutual dependence. Just as two physical bodies are joined by physical\ncontact, and as two minds are joined by love, the mind and body are\njoined by a mutually dependent activity. So long as the body actually\nreceives its specific motions dependently on the soul, and the soul\nactually receives its local motions (passions) dependently on the\nbody, then the spirit and the body are joined. Although there can be\nno mode common to mind and matter, there is this mutual action and\nhence a similitude and relation: \u201cThis similitude and relation\nwe have formerly affirmed to consist in action and passion.\u201d\n(Ibid., p. 325) In other words, just as the body is capable\nof receiving and transmitting local motions since motion is a mode of\nmatter, the mind is capable of varying passions since passions are a\nmode of the mind. It is by the mutual commerce of such motions and\npassions that the mind and body are said to be united. The mutual\nactivity said to occur between the mind and the body is a property\nwhich follows only from the union of mind and body and cannot proceed\nfrom either alone, \u201cAnd the truth is, since neither body can\nthink, nor mind be capable of dimension, there can be no mode common\nto mind and body, except a mutual acting of each upon each, from which\nalone the properties of both can follow.\u201d (1694, p. 325).\n\nIn natural philosophy, Le Grand extended Descartes\u2019s physics to\ninclude phenomena that would now be classified as metallurgy,\nentomology, botany, biology, physiology, medicine, psychology, and\npsychiatry. Book II of the Entire Body of Philosophy,\nentitled The History of Nature, catalogues and critically\ndiscusses the latest experiments of his time, as well as the theories\nof the ancients and moderns. Prominent in his discussions is the\nimportance of secondary causes in nature (both exemplary and secondary\nefficient causes), and the need for experiments, not just as tools of\nconfirmation, but also as a means of discovering the true nature of\nthings. This was due to his application of mechanism to explain not\nonly the behavior of material bodies but also the entire institution\nof nature. Le Grand believed that God laid down the laws of nature and\nthe principles of being by acting as the primary efficient cause, and\nthat the operation of these laws and principles manifested themselves\nin nature in the form of secondary causes and effects. Although the\nlaws and their specific mechanisms of operation are not visible,\nsecondary causes and their effects are. These causes and effects then\nare known by experience and are the starting point of all science,\nwhich is characterized by reasoning from effects (observed in nature)\nto causes (first principles discerned by reason). Book III of the\nEntire Body of Philosophy, entitled A Dissertation of the\nWant of Sense and Knowledge in Brute Animals, extends\nDescartes\u2019s treatment of the mechanization of the sensitive soul\nto explain sensory, motor, and appetitive functions. In addition to\ndefending Descartes\u2019s controversial theses that life functions\nare reducible to material motions and that animals are mere machines,\nhe provides an account of how cartesian organic bodies have identity\nover time. (Adriaenssen, 2018) As Hatfield shows, Le Grand\u2019s\ncompendium of nature demonstrates the magnitude of the Cartesian\nproject to mechanize life and the soul. Its detailed observations and\nrich descriptions lay the groundwork for Cartesian physiology and\npsychology. (Hatfield, 2013)\n3. Epistemology\n\nLe Grand\u2019s account of sensations and ideas is orthodox in its\nCartesianism, although ampliative in interesting ways. Sensory\nimpressions are what mediate the external object and our mind\u2019s\nidea of it, and they consist in nothing more than the immediate\nmotions of the sensory organs in the body. Such motions are produced\nby a natural necessity and they share no similarity or affinity with\nthe particular objects that cause them. Like Descartes, Le Grand used\nthe example of a sword wounding the body to illustrate the\nnon-resemblance or dissimilitude of the relations between external\nobjects and sensations, and sensations and ideas. (1694, book I, part\nix, p. 327) A sword that produces pain in us is nothing like our\nsensation or idea of pain, nor is our idea of pain anything like our\nsensation of pain. Yet, we maintain that there is a causal and\nrepresentational relation between the sword and the idea it produces.\nIn addition, Le Grand like Descartes made a clear distinction between\nsensory impressions and ideas. Sensory impressions are particular,\nquantifiable motions, whereas ideas are representational and\npropositional in character. Given that sensations are non-resembling\nand non-representational it follows that ideas, which are essentially\nrepresentational, could not be derived from sensations. Due to the\nlack of any form of similitude or affinity between object/sensation,\nand sensation/idea, it follows that there is no such relation that\nholds between an idea and an external (material) object. From this\nlack of similitude, Le Grand concluded that adventitious ideas (coming\nfrom material objects outside us) must be innate or inbred in the\nmind. For, if the external object is not like the idea we form of it,\nthen the only explanation remaining is that the mind is responsible\nfor it. Likewise, fictitious ideas, such as sirens and chimeras, have\nno exemplar outside the mind and so must be formed according to forms\nnatural to the human mind. And finally, common notions such as\nsubstance, truth, goodness, equity, and God, as well as axioms such as\n\u2018the same thing cannot be and not be,\u2019 must also be\ninnate, that is, they must proceed from the mind alone, since all\ncorporeal motions are particular but these notions are universal.\nAccording to Le Grand, innate ideas do not proceed from the senses or\nthe imagination but \u201care congenite and inbred with the said\nmind, from their original\u201d (1694, book I, part ix, p. 328). By\nthis Le Grand meant that the mind or thought itself, not any of its\nfaculties such as sense, imagination, or intellection, is the\nprinciple or original of such ideas. These ideas are formed in the\nmind by the mind and from the mind.\n\nThus, as Descartes held, there are three kinds of ideas, adventitious,\nfictitious, and innate, which are distinguished by their differing\nsources as well as the way in which they are inbred in the mind.\nAdventitious ideas proceed from the senses, fictitious ideas proceed\nfrom the imagination and the intellect, and innate ideas proceed from\nthought itself, which acts as their ground or original. Nonetheless,\nall ideas, regardless of their source or origin, depend on the mind in\nsome essential way for their form. But this gives rise to the problem\nof explaining how ideas can be said to represent, if they in no way\nresemble their objects. (Watson, 1966, chapter 6) This problem is\nespecially acute for Cartesians who held that there is a modal\ndifference between what is found at the level of sensory perception\nand intellection, such that impressions cannot contain any of the\nproperties found at the level of ideas. What arrives at our faculty of\nthinking from the senses is not ideas such as we form them in our\nthought, as the scholastic empiricists held, but rather only various\nparticular motions emitted by external objects. (1694, book I, part\nix, p. 328)\n\nLe Grand\u2019s solution to the problem of how ideas represent their\nobjects absent similitude was to employ the notion of substitution or\n\u2018supplying a stead\u2019\u2014wherein the cause (the object)\ncontains all the properties found in the effect (the idea) not\nactually but in virtue of its ability to supply the substitute\nproperties or proxies. According to Le Grand, \u201c[the] relation of\nsubstitution is that which intervenes betwixt the sign, and that which\nis signified by it.\u201d (1694, book I, part I, p. 17) Such a\nrelation, \u201c\u2026is nothing else but a mode of our\nunderstanding, comparing one thing with others, because of some\nproperties or acts that are found in them.\u201d (Ibid., p.\n17). By virtue of a kind of causal concomitance of the\nsigned-signified pairs there arises a signifying relation. Descartes\nhimself never develops the notion of representation in terms of\nsubstitution, although he came close to suggesting it in the French\nversion of the Third Meditation, in which he claimed that such things\nas extension, shape, position and movement may be contained in him\neminently, \u201c\u2026and as it were the garments under which\ncorporeal substance appears to us.\u201d (1985\u201391, II, fn.1, p.\n31). One could conceivably interpret this to mean that the garments of\ncorporeal substance, namely extension, shape, position and movement\nare the garments supplied by the mind as the forms or the conceptions\nunder which the mind grasps material things. Although the mind itself\nis not extended, shaped, locally positioned or moved, it dresses\nmaterial substance in these properties in order to perceive particular\nmaterial things. But there is no suggestion in Descartes regarding how\nthe dressing is related to the material object grasped. Le\nGrand\u2019s notion of substitution provided an explication of this\nrelation, and constitutes his contribution to the Cartesian dialectic\non ideas.\n\nLe Grand was one of the few Cartesians to see the connection Descartes\ndrew between the doctrine of the creation of essences and eternal\ntruths (Creation Doctrine) and establishing the proper foundation of\nhuman knowledge and certainty. The thesis is that God is the efficient\ncause of all things equally in their existence and essence, including\nthe truths we call eternal. Given the immutability and indivisibility\nof God\u2019s will, once God chose to create the world in its being\nand essence, it could not be changed. In 1630, Descartes introduced\nthe Creation Doctrine in his correspondence with Mersenne to explain\nthe sense in which the truths of mathematics, such as 2+2=4, are\nnecessarily true but could have been otherwise. According to\nDescartes, such truths are created, \u201cThe mathematical truths\nwhich you call eternal have been laid down by God and depend on him\nentirely no less than the rest of his creatures.\u201d\n(1985\u201391, III, p. 23) The sense in which God could have\nmade a universe in which 2+2 did not equal 4, or not willed a\nworld at all, is beyond our grasp. What we know is that once the\neternal truths are established in their being according to God\u2019s\nwill, they become necessary and knowable to the human intellect,\n\u201cIn general we can assert that God can do everything that is\nwithin our grasp but not that he cannot do what is beyond our grasp.\nIt would be rash to think that our imagination reaches as far as his\npower.\u201d (1985\u201391, III, p. 23)\n\nAlthough Descartes promised to expand on this idea in his physics, and\npleads with Mersenne to test the idea out on others (without\nmentioning his name), he seems instead to have abandoned it or decided\nnot to publish on it further. (Ibid., p. 23) Le Grand was\namong a minority of Descartes\u2019s successors to take up a defense\nof the Creation Doctrine. Le Grand draws on Descartes\u2019s analogy\nof God laying down the eternal truths in the manner that a king lays\ndown the laws of his kingdom: \u201cThe case of God and a king are\nvery different. A king can change his laws because his will is\nchangeable, but God\u2019s will is unchangeable; for it is his\nperfection that he acts in a most constant and invariable manner ...\nWherefore tho\u2019 I cannot comprehend how it should not be true,\nthat one and five are six; yet I understand clearly enough that it is\nimpossible there should be anything in the whole universe of things\nwhich does not depend on him.\u201d (1694, book I, part ii, p. 63)\nThe main worry that critics such as Malebranche had of this doctrine\nwas that it would remove any necessary foundation for the propositions\nof science and theology, making them contingent and uncertain. Le\nGrand\u2019s answer is that whereas the creation of true and\nimmutable natures was the work of God\u2019s free will (not dictated\naccording to his Wisdom, as Malebranche and other critics held), once\ncreated, they are necessary. In order to tie this necessity to the\nimmutability of God\u2019s will without limiting God in any way, Le\nGrand drew on a Scholastic distinction between antecedent and\nconsequent necessity. He argued that true and immutable natures, such\nas mathematical truths, only possessed a consequent necessity. God did\nnot will that 5+1=6 because he saw it could not be otherwise, but in\nvirtue of his free will, 5+1 [necessarily] = 6; therefore it could not\nbe otherwise. As Descartes put this same point, \u201cAnd even if God\nhas willed that some truths should be necessary, this does not mean\nthat he willed them necessarily; for it is one thing to will that they\nbe necessary, and quite another to will this necessarily, or to be\nnecessitated to will it.\u201d (1985\u201391, III, p. 235). For\nnothing outside of God, not even the eternal truths or immutable\nessences, necessitate that God act in one way or another, but rather,\nthey are themselves eternal and immutable in virtue of the fact that\nGod, whose existence is necessary and immutable, willed them in their\nessence and existence. Eternal truths and immutable essences are\nnecessary only in that they presuppose and are consequent to the act\nof God who caused them. (Easton, 2009)\n\nEchoing Descartes in part VI of the Discourse on Method, Le\nGrand held that God implanted certain simple, true, and immutable\nideas in our minds so that we could have a science of nature. God also\ncreated nature with powers so ample and vast that observation becomes\nmore and more necessary to advance our knowledge. Like Descartes,\nwhile Le Grand retains the essential role of reason in knowing\nimmutable essences, laws, and truths it is tempered by the realization\nthat the effects in nature are so numerous that observation is needed\nto connect our understanding to them. This dependence means that\ntruths of natural philosophy must be sought after in the effects of\nnature, and not in something independent of those effects. In other\nwords, our search for the truths of nature is in the specific\noperations of things, and even though our understanding of these\ntruths is importantly independent of these specific operations, our\ndiscovery of them is not. (see also, Hatfield, 2013)\n4. Ethics\n\nLe Grand\u2019s early ethical and political writings are not\nCartesian. In Le Sage des Sto\u00efques, ou l\u2019Homme sans\nPassions, Selon les Sentiments de S\u00e9n\u00e8que (1662),\nlater translated and published as Man Without Passions\n(1675), he expounds the Stoical doctrines of Seneca, for which the\ngoal of the moral person is to expunge the passions. He later rejected\nthis view of the passions and argued the Cartesian view that the\npassions ought to be trained (not expunged) in the moral life. Le\nGrand also wrote a curious political treatise, Scydromedia\n(1669), which is a semi-fictional, utopian work describing his vision\nof the ideal state.\n\nThere is nothing innovative in Le Grand\u2019s moral theory, yet his\ndiscussions are rich with references to ancient and contemporary\ntheories. He borrows from the ancient Atomists, the Stoics, the\nScholastics, and the \u201cMoralists\u201d of his time, and frames\nit, where possible, in Cartesian terms. Le Grand acknowledges that\nDescartes himself wrote little on ethics, but he argues that\nDescartes\u2019s treatment of the soul and the passions provides a\nsolid foundation for the treatment of moral matters. According to Le\nGrand, the object of ethics is right reason, its end is the perfection\nof man, and it is an active not a speculative science. An example of\nhis reconciling project can be seen in Book I, Part X of his\nEntire Body of Philosophy (1694), where Le Grand attempted to\nreconcile the doctrines of Seneca and Epicurus on the role of pleasure\nin the virtuous life, by drawing on Descartes\u2019s theory of the\npassions. (1694, p. 347) He argues that pleasure has a role to play in\nthe moral life, since virtue depends on free will (as the Stoics held)\nand pleasure derives from the satisfaction of the mind in possessing\nthe good (as Epicurus held). What Descartes\u2019s theory provided\nwas an explanation of how pleasure (a passion) could aid the will in\nchoosing the right course of action, while maintaining the voluntary\nnature of the will and virtue.\n\nIn summary, Le Grand is worthy of study for his contribution to the\nreception and development of Cartesianism in the latter half of the\nseventeenth century. He expanded the application of Descartes\u2019s\nnatural philosophy to a variety of observations and experiments of his\nday, and advanced Descartes\u2019s ideas regarding the mechanization\nof nature, the causal interaction and union of minds and bodies, the\nnature of representation and truth, and in the realm of morals, how\nDescartes\u2019s theory of the passions provides an important account\nof virtue. No less important is the fact that he spent most of his\nlife in England, where his contact with members of the Royal Society\nand the universities of Cambridge and Oxford had a lasting impact on\nthe reception of Descartes\u2019s ideas in England, Germany, and\nFrance.\n",
