    "main_text": "Challenges to the Replicator || Evolution by Natural Selection without Replication\n5.2 Evolution by Natural Selection without Replication\n\nGodfrey-Smith (2009; see also Godfrey-Smith 2000b; Griesemer 2005)\ncontrasts the replicator/interactor approach to natural selection with\na more classical approach. This latter approach is usually given as a\n\u201crecipe\u201d for evolution by natural selection, to use\nGodfrey-Smith\u2019s terminology (see also Brandon 1990: 3.1). Ever\nsince Darwin, a number of authors have proposed that for evolution by\nnatural selection to occur, three conditions or ingredients are\nnecessary. A population should exhibit (1) variation that (2)\nleads to differences in fitness between the entities forming the\npopulation [see the entry on\n fitness],\n (3) which are heritable (reviewed in Godfrey-Smith 2007). The most\nfamous version of these recipes is that provided by Lewontin\n(1970).\n\nThere is a difference in emphasis between the two approaches in that\nthe replicator/interactor approach focuses on the entities\nforming the population, while the classical approach provides a\npopulation description of evolutionary change. Another difference\nbetween the two approaches is that under the classical approach,\nreplication is not required for evolution by natural selection to\noccur. In fact, as long as heritability is positive, and the two other\nconditions are satisfied, evolution by natural selection can occur\n(but will not necessarily do so, cf. Godfrey-Smith 2009: 25). An\nabstract definition of heritability (\\(h^2\\))\u2014although by no\nmeans fully general (see Bourrat 2015a, 2022)\u2014is that it\nrepresents the slope of the regression of average offspring character\non parent or mid-parent (in case of sexual species) character [see the\nentry on\n heritability].\n Given that a positive heritability does not entail replication of\ncharacter between parent and offspring, but is rather a special\ncase in which heritability would be exactly 1 in the absence of\nenvironmental variation, the replicator/interactor perspective is\nsubsumed by the classical approach. Godfrey-Smith concurs:\n\n\nFrom this point of view, we can see the replicator analysis as picking\nout a special case of what is covered (or supposed to be covered) by\nthe classical view. (2009: 36; see also Godfrey-Smith 2000b)\n\n\nTo see why a lack of replication does not prevent evolution by natural\nselection from occurring, suppose a population of entities exists with\ndifferent sizes, as presented in\n Figure 3(a),\n in which there is selection for larger entities. We assume that the\nentities reproduce asexually in discrete generations and that there is\nno environmental variation. At the parental generation, there are two\ntypes of individuals, with respective sizes of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and 1.\nDue to the selection for size, entities of size \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\nproduce 3 offspring while entities of size 1 produce 4 offspring.\nSuppose now that there is a positive heritability, as defined above,\nso that, on average, offspring resemble more their parent than they\nresemble other entities of the parental generation, as displayed on\n Figure 3(a),\n but only slightly so (\\(h^2 = 0.2\\)). After one generation, although\nthere is no high-fidelity replication, the average size of the\npopulation has changed due to the effect of natural selection.\nThis simple example demonstrates quite straightforwardly that\nreplication is not required for evolution by natural selection to\noccur.\n\nWe said earlier that replication would imply a heritability of exactly\n1 in the absence of environmental variation. Although this is correct,\nthe reverse is not true. In fact, take again a similar population as\nin\n Figure 3(a),\n but this time assume a different pattern of inheritance for the two\ntypes of entities, as displayed in\n Figure 3(b).\n With this pattern of inheritance, although there is no replication,\nentities on average have the exact same character\nvalue as their parent. In the case of the entities of size\n\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), some offspring have the exact same character\nas their parent, but that is not required either, as is the case with\nthe entities of size 1, of which none of the offspring has the same\ncharacter as their parent.\n\nOne possible response against regarding the classical approach to\nevolution by natural selection as unconditionally superior to the\nreplicator/interactor approach is to argue that although\nevolution by natural selection can occur without replication, when\nthis happens, the evolutionary change resulting is not a pure\ncase of evolution by natural selection. Rather, it is evolution by\nnatural selection mixed with some other evolutionary processes. A\nrationale for this claim is that the fact that offspring do not\nresemble their parent introduces some variation into the population of\nwhich the origin is not natural selection. In abstract terms, the\nintroduction of variation can be regarded as a form of mutation\n(Bourrat 2019). Under this interpretation, the classical\napproach, on the one hand, and the replicator/interactor approach, on\nthe other hand, simply emphasize different aspects of evolutionary\nexplanations. The classical approach gives us evolutionary\nexplanations in the context of other evolutionary processes\noccurring, while the replicator/interactor approach gives us\nevolutionary explanations of what the effect of natural selection\nwould be in the absence of any other evolutionary process acting in\nthe population\u2014that is, in its pure form. Understood that\nway, the two approaches do not necessarily need to be opposed.\n\nAnother problem with the idea of replication is that it is description\ndependent. Described finely, two objects can never be identical. The\nsame applies to parents and offspring. This, in itself, does not\nrepresent a challenge to the replicator/interactor view. However,\nand more problematically, a coarser grain of description might\nlead parents and offspring to be regarded as copies of one another\nwhen a finer-grained description would show that they are not. Such a\ncoarse-grained way of viewing evolutionary processes has been endorsed\nby some memeticists (see Boudry 2018; Dennett 2017 for explicit\ndefences). However, without a principled way to choose which\ngrain(s) of description ought to be used for the study of a particular\nevolutionary setting, the claim that replication is fundamental to\nevolution by natural selection in the context of other evolutionary\nprocesses occurring becomes arbitrary. This problem is a general one\nin evolutionary theory (see Bourrat, 2020), but is even more\nproblematic in the context of cultural evolution where the\nline between genotype and phenotype is difficult to draw\nand multiple channels of transmission exist (Charbonneau\n& Bourrat 2021; Bourrat & Charbonneau\n2022). \n",
