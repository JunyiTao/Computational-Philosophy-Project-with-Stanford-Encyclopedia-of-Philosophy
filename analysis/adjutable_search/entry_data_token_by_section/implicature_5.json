Gricean Theory\n\nIn addition to identifying the phenomenon of implicature, and\nclassifying its types, Grice developed a theory designed to explain\nand predict conversational implicatures and to describe how they are\nunderstood. Grice (1975: 26\u201330) postulated a general\nCooperative Principle and four maxims specifying how\nto be cooperative. It is common knowledge, he asserted, that people\ngenerally follow these rules for efficient communication.\n\n\nCooperative Principle. Contribute what is required by\nthe accepted purpose of the conversation.\n\nMaxim of Quality. Make your contribution true; so do not\nconvey what you believe false or\n unjustified.[30]\n\nMaxim of Quantity. Be as informative as required.\nMaxim of Relation. Be relevant.\nMaxim of Manner. Be perspicuous; so avoid obscurity and\nambiguity, and strive for brevity and order.\n\n\n\nGrice viewed these not as arbitrary conventions, but as instances of\ngeneral rules governing rational, cooperative behavior. For example,\nif Jane is helping Kelly build a house, she will hand Kelly a hammer\nrather than a tennis racket (relevance), more than one nail when\nseveral are needed (quantity), and straight nails rather than bent\nones (quality); she will do all this quickly and efficiently\n(manner).\n\nRelevance implicatures like\n (1)\n are thought to arise from the maxim of Relation. Barb would have\ninfringed this maxim unless her contribution were relevant to the\npurpose of the conversation. If Barb was being cooperative, then she\nwas trying to answer Alan\u2019s question. Given that working is\nincompatible with partying, it is inferred that Barb must have\nintended to communicate that she is not going to the party. Grice\n(1975: 34) thought other implicatures arise by flouting\nmaxims. This happens when what a cooperative speaker says so patently\nviolates a maxim that the hearer must infer that the speaker means\nsomething different. Irony is thought to arise from flouting the maxim\nof Quality\n (\u00a79).\n\nGeneralizing from such examples, Grice provided a theoretical account\nof conversational implicature that has been widely\n adopted.[31]\n A representative formulation goes as follows, with S the\nspeaker and H the hearer.\n\n\nTheoretical Definition: S conversationally\nimplicates p iff S implicates p when:\n\nS is presumed to be observing the Cooperative Principle\n(Cooperative Presumption);\nThe supposition that S believes p is required to\nmake S\u2019s utterance consistent with the Cooperative\nPrinciple (Determinacy); and\nS believes (or knows), and expects H to believe\nthat S believes, that H is able to determine that\n(ii) is true (Mutual Knowledge).\n\n\n\nThis says that an implicature is conversational provided conditions\n(i)\u2013(iii) are satisfied, where (ii) is the condition that\nS\u2019s believing p is required for\nS to be in conformity with the Cooperative Principle. The\nTheoretical Definition does not entail that S implicated p is\ninferable from (i)\u2013(iii). Calculability does that.\n\n\nCalculability: Conversational implicatures must be\ncapable of being worked\n out.[32]\n\n\nGrice\u2019s calculability principle says more than that hearers are\ngenerally able to infer what speakers implicate on the basis of the\nlinguistic meaning of what they utter. That would not be distinctive\nof implicature given that the same is true of what people\n say.[33]\n To work out an implicature is to infer it in a specific way\nfrom the Cooperative Principle using particular facts about the\nmeaning of the sentence uttered and the context of utterance.\n\n\nTo work out that a particular conversational implicature is present,\nthe hearer will rely on the following data: (1) the conventional\nmeaning of the words used, together with the identity of any\nreferences that may be involved; (2) the Cooperative Principle and its\nmaxims; (3) the context, linguistic or otherwise, of the utterance;\n(4) other items of background knowledge; and (5) the fact (or supposed\nfact) that all relevant items falling under the previous headings are\navailable to both participants and both participants know or assume\nthis to be the case. A general pattern for the working-out of a\nconversational implicature might be given as follows: He has said\nthat q; there is no reason to suppose that he is not observing the\nmaxims, or at least the Cooperative Principle [Cooperative\nPresumption]; he could not be doing this unless he thought that\np [Determinacy]; he knows (and knows that I know that he\nknows) that I can see that the supposition that he thinks that\np is required [Mutual Knowledge]; he has done nothing to stop\nme thinking that p; he intends me to think, or is at least\nwilling to allow me to think, that p; and so he has\nimplicated that p. (Grice 1975: 31; my emphasis\nand insertions)\n\n\nKey steps of the working out schema have been named in brackets,\ncorresponding to (i)\u2013(iii) in the Theoretical\n Definition.[34]\n\nIn addition to postulating that the conversationality of an\nimplicature depends on the Cooperative Presumption, Determinacy, and\nMutual Knowledge conditions, and that the implicature can be inferred\nin part from their satisfaction, Grice claimed that the conditions\ngive rise to or generate the implicatures.\nThe implicatures exist because conditions\n(i)\u2013(iii) are\n satisfied.[35]\n From his assumption that conversational implicatures can be explained\nand predicted on the basis of the Cooperative Principle, Grice drew a\nmethodological conclusion:\n\n\nGrice\u2019s Razor: Other things equal, it is\npreferable to postulate conversational implicatures rather than\nsenses, semantic implicatures, or semantic presuppositions because\nconversational implicatures can be derived from independently\nmotivated psycho-social\n principles.[36]\n\n\nThe pithy formulation is \u201cSenses are not to be multiplied beyond\nnecessity\u201d, alluding to Ockham. If a phenomenon can be explained\nand predicted in terms of psycho-social principles, then it is\ntheoretically more economical to do so than to posit senses and the\nlike, which cannot be so explained. Grice\u2019s Razor is often\ninvoked to support classifying the exclusive interpretation of\n\u201cp or q\u201d as an implicature rather than\nas a second sense\n (\u00a75).\n\nFollowing Grice, \u201cconversational implicature\u201d was defined\nin\n \u00a72\n to mean an implicature that depends on features of the\nconversational context and is not determined by the conventional\nmeaning of the sentence uttered. On this definition,\nGrice\u2019s Theoretical Definition and Calculability are empirical\nhypotheses that may turn out to be false. Indeed, we will review\nevidence against these hypotheses below. Many linguists and\nphilosophers, however, take Calculability to be true by definition.\nThey take \u201cconversational implicature\u201d to mean an\nimplicature that can be worked out from what is said and the\nCooperative Principle or its\n maxims.[37]\n If this definition is adopted, then what the evidence would show is\nthat the implicatures illustrated in\n \u00a7\u00a71\u20134\n are not conversational, even those that are not conventional in\nGrice\u2019s sense (cf. Lepore & Stone 2015: 6, 83, 148).\n",
