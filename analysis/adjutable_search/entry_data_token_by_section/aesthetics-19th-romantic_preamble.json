    "main_text": "\n\nUnderstanding romantic aesthetics is not a simple undertaking for\nreasons that are internal to the nature of the subject. Distinguished\nscholars, such as Arthur Lovejoy, Northrop Frye and Isaiah Berlin,\nhave remarked on the notorious challenges facing any attempt to define\nromanticism. Lovejoy, for example, claimed that romanticism is\n\u201cthe scandal of literary history and criticism\u201d (1960:\n234). The main difficulty in studying the romantics, according to him,\nis the lack of any \u201csingle real entity, or type of entity\u201d\nthat the concept \u201cromanticism\u201d designates. Lovejoy\nconcluded, \u201cthe word \u2018romantic\u2019 has come to mean so\nmany things that, by itself, it means nothing\u201d (1960: 235).\n\nThe more specific task of characterizing romantic aesthetics\nadds to these difficulties an air of paradox. Conventionally,\n\u201caesthetics\u201d refers to a theory concerning beauty and art\nor the branch of philosophy that studies these topics. However, many\nof the romantics rejected the identification of aesthetics with a\ncircumscribed domain of human life that is separated from the\npractical and theoretical domains of life. The most characteristic\nromantic commitment is to the idea that the character of art and\nbeauty and of our engagement with them should shape all aspects of\nhuman life. Being fundamental to human existence, beauty and art\nshould be a central ingredient not only in a philosophical or artistic\nlife, but also in the lives of ordinary men and women. Another\nchallenge for any attempt to characterize romantic aesthetics lies in\nthe fact that most of the romantics were poets and artists whose views\nof art and beauty are, for the most part, to be found not in developed\ntheoretical accounts, but in fragments, aphorisms and poems, which are\noften more elusive and suggestive than conclusive.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of these challenges the task of characterizing\nromantic aesthetics is neither impossible nor undesirable, as numerous\nthinkers responding to Lovejoy\u2019s radical skepticism have noted.\nWhile warning against a reductive definition of romanticism, Berlin,\nfor example, still heralded the need for a general\ncharacterization:\n\n\n[Although] one does\u2026have a certain sympathy with\nLovejoy\u2019s despair\u2026[he is] in this instance mistaken.\nThere was a romantic movement; it did have something which\nwas central to it; it did create a great revolution in consciousness,\nand it is important to discover what it is. (1999: 20) \n\n\nRecent attempts to characterize romanticism and to stress its\ncontemporary relevance follow this path. Instead of overlooking the\nundeniable differences between the variety of romanticisms of\ndifferent nations that Lovejoy had stressed, such studies attempt to\ncharacterize romanticism, not in terms of a single definition, a\nspecific time, or a specific place, but in terms of \u201cparticular\nphilosophical questions and concerns\u201d (Nassar 2014b: 10,\nn.9).\n\nThis entry approaches the topic along similar lines in order to\nidentify a cluster of related questions, concerns, themes, and\napproaches that are characteristics of the aesthetics of various\nromanticisms, and in order to bring out what is \u201cromantic\u201d\nin them. In lieu of a chronological, geographical, national, or\nfigure-based organization, the following is structured\nthematically\u2014it focuses on the central romantic commitment to\nthe primacy of aesthetics (introduced in\n \u00a71),\n and offers different philosophical explanations of this primacy (in\nthe remaining sections).\n\nWhile the German, British and French romantics are all considered, the\ncentral protagonists in the following are the German romantics. Two\nreasons explain this focus: first, because it has paved the way for\nthe other romanticisms, German romanticism has a pride of place among\nthe different national romanticisms (cf. Lovejoy 1960 and Berlin\n1999). Second, the aesthetic outlook that was developed in Germany\nroughly between 1796 and 1801\u201302\u2014the period that\ncorresponds to the heyday of what is known as \u201cEarly\nRomanticism\u201d\n [Fr\u00fchromantik][1]\u2014offers\n the most philosophical expression of romanticism since it is\ngrounded primarily in the epistemological, metaphysical, ethical, and\npolitical concerns that the German romantics discerned in the\naftermath of Kant\u2019s\n philosophy.[2]\n The entry elaborates on these concerns and explains how they shed\nlight on the romantic understanding of beauty and art as fundamental\nin human life.\n",
