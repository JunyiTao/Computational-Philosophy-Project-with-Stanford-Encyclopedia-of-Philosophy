    "main_text": "Indexical Belief and Indexical Semantics || Direct-Reference Responses to Arguments against Their Views\n4.3 Direct-Reference Responses to Arguments against Their Views\n\n\nWe will soon consider other theories of indexical belief, and\nalternative semantic theories for indexicals, that are motivated by the\nabove examples of indexical belief. But before doing so, let us\nconsider how direct-reference theorists have responded to the earlier\nobjections to their views.\n\n\nPerry (1977, 1979) and Kaplan (1989a), claim that belief is a\nbinary relation that agents can bear to propositions. But they\nsay that this relation is mediated by a third entity. (Compare\nwith assertion: assertion is a binary relation between agents and\npropositions, but it is mediated by sentences, or their characters.)\nThus Perry and Kaplan claim that agents can believe a singular\nproposition in different ways. (Compare again with assertion:\nJohn can assert the singular proposition that he is shopping in at\nleast two ways, by uttering either \u2018John is shopping\u2019 or\n\u2018I am shopping\u2019.) Moreover, a rational agent can rationally\nbelieve both a proposition and its negation, as long as he does so in\nsuitably different ways.\n\n\nPerry (1977) and Kaplan (1989a) take the relevant mediators of belief to be\ncharacters (Perry calls them \u2018roles\u2019). An agent can believe\na proposition under one character, but fail to believe it\nunder another character. This is John\u2019s state when he first sees\nthe messy shopper at \\(t_0\\), and he is willing to utter\n\u2018He is making a mess\u2019 but is not willing to utter \u2018I\nam making a mess\u2019. Perry and Kaplan also hold that a rational\nagent can believe a proposition under one character and also believe\nthe negation of that proposition under a suitably different character.\nThis is what happens when John utters \u2018He is making a mess\u2019\nand \u2018I am not making a mess\u2019 in the slightly modified\nexample: John believes the singular proposition that John is making\nmess under the character of \u2018He is making a mess\u2019 but\nbelieves the negation of that proposition under the character of\n\u2018I am not making mess\u2019. He is rational because the second\ncharacter is not the negation of the first character (roughly speaking).\n\n\nThe claim that agents believe propositions under characters\nis reasonably clear when agents utter sentences to express their\nindexical beliefs. But agents believe many propositions that they do\nnot express with sentences. Perhaps for this reason, Perry (1979)\nmodifies the ways-of-believing theory by distinguishing between (i) the\nproposition that an agent believes and (ii) the belief state\nin virtue of which the agent believes that proposition. Perry holds\nthat for any one proposition, there are many belief states that would\nenable an agent to believe that proposition. An agent can be in one of\nthese belief states while failing to be in another. Belief states can\nbe classified into types by the characters of the sentences that they\ndispose agents to utter. For instance, a belief state that would cause\nJohn to utter \u2018He is making a mess\u2019 can be classified with\nthe character of that sentence, whereas a belief state that disposes\nJohn to utter \u2018I am making mess\u2019 can be classified with the\ncharacter of that sentence. John can rationally be in a belief state of\nthe first sort while failing to be in a belief state of the second\nsort. He can, in addition, be in a belief state of the first sort while\nalso being in a belief state that disposes him to utter the negation of\nthe second. For further discussion and criticisms, see Wettstein\n(1986), Taschek (1987), and Crimmins (1992, chapter 1).\n\n\nPerry\u2019s subsequent theories replace belief states with more\nelaborate systems of mental representation, and replace classification\nof belief states by characters with classifications of mental\nrepresentations by cognitive roles and various types of semantic\nvalues. For details, see the papers that appear in Perry (1997,\n2001).\n",
