    "main_text": "The Scope of Ancient Political Philosophy\n1. The Scope of Ancient Political Philosophy\n\nWe find the etymological origins of two key terms in the title of this\narticle, \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201cphilosophy\u201d, in\nancient Greek: the former originally pertaining to the polis\nor city-state; the latter being the practice of a particular kind of\ninquiry conceived literally as the \u201clove of wisdom\u201d\n(philosophia). These ideas were transmitted beyond the\nconfines of the classical polis as the Greek city-states came\nunder the suzerainty of larger kingdoms after an initial Macedonian\nconquest at the end of the fourth century B.C; those kingdoms in turn\nwere eventually conquered and significantly assimilated by the Roman\nrepublic, later transmuted into an empire. Philosophers writing in\nLatin engaged self-consciously with the earlier and continuing\ntraditions of writing about philosophy in Greek. Already from its\norigins, Greek political philosophy put the question of the forms of\nregimes or \u201cconstitutions\u201d (politeia, singular)\nat the center of its concerns. The classification of types of\nconstitutions already found in Herodotus, fleshed out by Plato, and\nfurther adapted by Aristotle\u2014in Aristotle\u2019s version,\nthere were three \u201cgood\u201d regimes, namely, monarchy,\naristocracy, and a moderate form of democracy, as well as their three\n\u201cperversions,\u201d namely tyranny, oligarchy, and a bad form of\ndemocracy\u2014would continue to inform the discussion of politics\ninto the context of the \u201cmixed regime\u201d of the Roman\nrepublic, held to combine elements of all three of the good regimes.\nThese discussions were indexed to the particular historical setting\nunder consideration while also offering general principles that remain\nrelevant in many ways, even as the questions and contexts for\npolitical philosophy have changed.\n\nBecause the field of political philosophy so delineated has had a long\nhistory since then, long past the time when the ancient models were\naccepted as defining the field and determining the\n\u201cproblems\u201d to be considered, it is a mistake to approach\ntheir thought with a modern menu of expectations of what the subject\nwill contain. At the same time, because the Greeks also developed\nother genres widely recognized today\u2014among them, history,\ntragedy, comedy, and rhetoric\u2014no understanding of their thought\nabout politics can restrict itself to the genre of political\nphilosophy alone. Some argue, for example, that Thucydides\u2019\nelaboration of the nature of the political through his\nHistory of the fifth-century Peloponnesian War between\nleagues led by Athens and Sparta is more important and instructive\nthan that issuing from Plato\u2019s philosophical dialogues (Geuss\n2005). While that argument is contentious, it rests on an important\nbroader point. \u201cPolitics\u201d and what is\n\u201cpolitical\u201d emerged as part of a widespread set of\nsociolinguistic practices, most notably and best documented in Athens,\nwhile \u201cphilosophy\u201d was invented by a relatively small\nnumber of self-professed \u201cphilosophical\u201d thinkers. Thus\nthe invention of \u201cpolitical philosophy\u201d as a genre can be\nunderstood as a deliberate challenge to existing practices, and\nconceptions, of \u201cthe political.\u201d The challenge was\ndirected in particular, though not exclusively, to democratic\npractices in mid to late fifth century Athens, which was the\npolis both intellectually dominant and in many ways\npolitically exemplary at the time, as well as bequeathing the\nlion\u2019s share of our surviving evidence from ancient Greece\n(Meier 1990, Ober 2008; on the surviving evidence for ancient Greek\nphilosophy in general, see the entry on\n doxography for ancient philosophy).\n\nThis article therefore begins by surveying political practices and the\nreflective accounts to which they gave rise in the classical Greek\nperiod of the independent polis. It then turns to the\nthinkers who invented \u201cpolitical philosophy\u201d par\nexcellence: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. It continues to Hellenistic\nGreek thinkers before considering the main currents and roles of\npolitical philosophy in the Roman republic. While offering a survey of\ncertain developments in the Roman empire, it leaves aside the\ndistinctive contributions made by Jewish and Christian thinkers in\nthat period, and in particular the great upheaval of thought effected\nby Augustine, who was deeply engaged with classical authors such as\nPlato and Cicero, who became in turn a crucial starting point for\n medieval political philosophy.\n The article concludes with some reflections on how the nature of\n\u201cancient political philosophy\u201d should, and should not, be\nunderstood.\n",
