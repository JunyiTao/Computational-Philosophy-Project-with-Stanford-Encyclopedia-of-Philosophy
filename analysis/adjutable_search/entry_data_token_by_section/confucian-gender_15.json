By going beyond the western sphere, feminists\nintended to provide an empirical proof of the urgency and the ubiquity\nof gender oppression, while expanding their sphere of concern to\ninclude their less fortunate sisters in the \u201cthird-world\u201d.\nIn cross-cultural studies, the status of \u201cthird-world\u201d\nwomen is usually measured on a sliding scale of universal victimhood\nwith western women being the most liberated, the most\ngender-conscious, and the most self-determined (Mohanty 1984, 2003;\nMohanty, Russo, & Torres 1991; Narayan 1997). Western feminists\nsee gender-based oppression faced by non-western women as\n\u201csimilar but much worse\u201d, treating non-western\ncultures/traditions as the worsening factors aggravating the suffering\nof \u201cthird-world\u201d women.\n\nA multicultural approach to gender studies is said to be bad for\n\u201cthird-world\u201d women, since, unlike the west, non-western\ncultures/traditions are said to be deeply entrenched in their\npatriarchal past, and unlike western feminists,\n\u201cthird-world\u201d women with their \u201cfalse\nconsciousness\u201d have no agency of their own (Okin 1994: 5 &\n11; 1999: 22). The only solution to universal patriarchy then seems to\nbe a whole-sale importation of western thought and way of life to the\nrest of the world. For \u201cthird-world\u201d women are said to be\nbetter off, if their indigenous cultures are preferably changed by\nmodeling after the western liberal culture or simply \u201cto become\nextinct\u201d (Okin 1999: 22).\n\nIn the western imagination, footbinding remains as the favorite\nexample of Chinese patriarchy and moral depravity focusing on the\nexotic, highly sexualized nature of the practice (Levy 1966; Jackson\n1997; Dworkin 1974; Greenhalgh 1977; Daly 1978\n [1990]).[12]\n The familiar exoticization of footbinding is a clear case of\n\u201corientalism\u201d seeing non-western cultures as barbaric and\noppressive to the so-called \u201cthird-world\u201d women (Said\n1978). Even though there is no textual basis connecting Confucian\nphilosophy to the practice of footbinding that has persisted for a\nthousand years, the prolonged co-existence of the practice and\nConfucian teaching to some makes Confucian philosophy suspect by\nassociation.\n",
