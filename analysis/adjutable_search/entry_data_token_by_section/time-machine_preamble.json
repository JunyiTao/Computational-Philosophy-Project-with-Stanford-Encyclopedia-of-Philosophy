    "main_text": "\n\n\nRecent years have seen a growing consensus in the philosophical \ncommunity that the grandfather paradox and similar logical puzzles do\nnot preclude the possibility of time travel scenarios that utilize \nspacetimes containing closed timelike curves. At the same time, \nphysicists, who for half a century acknowledged that the general \ntheory of relativity is compatible with such spacetimes, have \nintensely studied the question whether the operation of a time \nmachine would be admissible in the context of the same theory and of \nits quantum cousins. A time machine is a device which brings about \nclosed timelike curves\u2014and thus enables time travel\u2014where\nnone would have existed otherwise. The physics literature contains \nvarious no-go theorems for time machines, i.e., theorems which \npurport to establish that, under physically plausible assumptions, \nthe operation of a time machine is impossible. We conclude that for \nthe time being there exists no conclusive no-go theorem against time \nmachines. The character of the material covered in this article makes\nit inevitable that its content is of a rather technical nature. We \ncontend, however, that philosophers should nevertheless be interested\nin this literature for at least two reasons. First, the topic of time\nmachines leads to a number of interesting foundations issues in \nclassical and quantum theories of gravity; and second, philosophers \ncan contribute to the topic by clarifying what it means for a device \nto count as a time machine, by relating the debate to other concerns \nsuch as Penrose\u2019s cosmic censorship conjecture and the fate of \ndeterminism in general relativity theory, and by eliminating a number\nof confusions regarding the status of the paradoxes of time travel. \nThe present article addresses these ambitions in as non-technical a \nmanner as possible, and the reader is referred to the relevant \nphysics literature for details.\n",
