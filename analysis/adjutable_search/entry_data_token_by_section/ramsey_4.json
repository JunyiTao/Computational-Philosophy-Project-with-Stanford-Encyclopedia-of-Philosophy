    "main_text": "Belief and Truth || Truth\n4.2 Truth\n\nThe posthumously-published paper \u2018The Nature of Truth\u2019\n(1929c) is specifically devoted to the analysis of truth, and there\nRamsey develops the few lines about truth included in \u2018Facts and\nPropositions\u2019 (1927a). Even if that earlier paper mostly deals\nwith belief, the brief remarks it contains on truth are among\nRamsey\u2019s most influential contributions to philosophy. What he\nhas to say in there about truth is stated almost as \u2018an obvious\nfact\u2019 (Sahlin 1990, 56), hence his famous remark that\n\u2018there is really no separate problem of truth but merely a\nlinguistic muddle\u2019 (1927a, [PP] 38).\n\nIn \u2018The Nature of Truth\u2019 Ramsey explains that beliefs, in\nthe sense that is relevant here, are necessarily beliefs that\n\u2018something or other is so-and-so\u2019 (1929c, 7ff). He calls\nthis \u2018so-and-so\u2019 the \u2018propositional reference\u2019\n(loc. cit.) and uses it as the criterion of propositional\nindividuation, in the sense that if \u2018two men both believe that\nthe earth is flat we say they have the same belief\u2019 (loc. cit.).\nIndividuating beliefs by their propositional references might seem at\nodds with the pragmatist method given in terms of causes and effects\nthat Ramsey used in \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019. But this\nsuperficial tension is defused if propositional references, which are\nnot linguistic but conceptual, are individuated by their consequences\n(which include actions). Other mental states \u2013 doubts, desires,\nfears, regrets, etc. \u2013 have propositional references too, but\nonly beliefs have \u2018affirmative or assertive character\u2019\n(1929c, 8). Ramsey proposes to extend the ordinary meaning of the term\n\u2018belief\u2019 to cover mental states with any degree of\nassertive force \u2013 from mere conjecture to full certainty \u2013\nand propositional content. The contents of beliefs, in this extended\nsense, are the bearers of truth: \u2018Truth and falsity are ascribed\nprimarily to propositions\u2019, he says (1927a, [PP] 38). Later, he\nsubstitutes \u2018proposition\u2019 with \u2018propositional\nreference\u2019 (1929c, 7), but this rewording owes more to\nphilosophical precaution than any substantial change in view.\n\nTruth adds nothing substantive to the content of beliefs, according to\nRamsey. He claims that the meaning of truth is \u2018perfectly\nobvious, that anyone can see what it is and that difficulty\nonly arises when we try to say what it is, because it is\nsomething which ordinary language is rather ill-adapted to\nexpress\u2019 (1929c, 9). Because of this, Ramsey\u2019s view is\ngenerally interpreted as a redundancy theory of truth (Sahlin 1990,\n56\u201359; Dokic and Engel 2002, 18; Hookway 2005, 56\u201358), a\nkind of minimalism or deflationism about truth similar to the views\nput forward by Aristotle and Frege (cf. Sahlin 1990, 56), and later on\nby Tarski, Wittgenstein, Quine (cf. Hookway 2005, 57), Field and\nHorwich (cf. Koslow 2005, 106).\n\nNevertheless, there is more to Ramsey\u2019s view than what the label\n\u2018redundancy\u2019 suggests. The bearers of truth, i.e.\npropositions, can be referred to directly, as in \u2018that Caesar\nwas murdered\u2019, or identified by description, as in \u2018what\nshe said\u2019. Correspondingly, truth can be attached to the direct\nexpression of a proposition, as in \u2018It is true that Caesar was\nmurdered\u2019, or to a description, as in \u2018what she says is\ntrue\u2019. When truth applies to expressions of the first kind,\nRamsey characterizes its role as eliminable: \u2018it is evident that\n\u201cIt is true that Caesar was murdered\u201d means no more than\nthat Caesar was murdered, and \u201cIt is false that Caesar was\nmurdered\u201d means that Caesar was not murdered\u2019 (1927a,\n[PP], 38\u20139). But when the truth predicate applies to expressions\nof the second kind, Ramsey explicitly claims that it cannot be\ndispensed with: \u2018In the second case in which the proposition is\ndescribed and not given explicitly we have perhaps more of a problem,\nfor we get statements from which we cannot in ordinary language\neliminate the words \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d\u2019\n(loc. cit.).\n\nLet us consider the following three examples of truth ascriptions in\nEnglish:\n\n(4.1)  All Joan\u2019s\nthoughts are true.\n(4.2)  What follows\nfrom a true premise is true.\n(4.3)  Evolutionism is\ntrue.\n\n\nTo say what truth consists in, and deal with any kind of\ntruth ascription, Ramsey enriches ordinary English into English* by\nthe addition of single propositional variables \u2013\n\u2018p\u2019, \u2018q\u2019, etc., ranging over\nthe set of declarative sentences \u2013 and propositional\nquantifiers. In English* the truth predicate vanishes and its role is\ntaken over by propositional variables and quantifiers. The semi-formal\nsentences (4.1*)\u2013(4.3*) are translations of (4.1)\u2013(4.3)\ninto English*:\n\n(4.1*)  For all\np, if Joan thinks that p, p. \n(4.2*)  For all\np and q, if q follows from p, and\np, then q. \n(4.3*)  For all\np, if p follows from the theory of evolution, then\np. \n\n\nNote that the translation shows that the truth apparatus is redundant\nin English*, but not that it is redundant in English.\n\nThe definition of truth Ramsey provides in \u2018The Nature of\nTruth\u2019 is: \u2018A belief is true if it is a belief that\np, and p\u2019 (1929c, [OT] 9), where the first\ninstance of the propositional variable \u2018p\u2019\nrepresents the propositional reference that individuates the belief at\nissue (1929c, [OT] 7), and the second instance represents the\nobjective factor. This definition is expressed in English*, since\nordinary English does not have the necessary resources:\n\nAs we claim to have defined truth we ought to be able to substitute\nour definition for the word \u201ctrue\u201d wherever it occurs. But\nthe difficulty we have mentioned renders this impossible in ordinary\nlanguage which treats what should really be called\npro-sentences as if they were pro-nouns. [\u2026]\n\u201cthat\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d even when functioning as\nshort for sentences always require to be supplied with a verb: this\nverb is often \u201cis true\u201d and this peculiarity of language\ngives rise to artificial problems as to the nature of truth, which\ndisappear at once when they are expressed in logical symbolism, in\nwhich we can render \u201cwhat he believed is true\u201d by\n\u201cif p was what he believed, p\u201d (1929c,\n[OT] 10, his emphasis).\n\nThis text is possibly the first unequivocal expression of a\nprosentential theory of truth (Dokic and Engel 2002, 19;\nFr\u00e1polli 2005a, 113\u2013138; 2013, 61ff).\n\nRamsey (1929c, [OT] 9) anticipated a possible reaction to his use of\npropositional variables and to the translation of (4.1)\u2013(4.3) as\n(4.1*)\u2013(4.3*). The objection is the following:\n(4.1*)\u2013(4.3*) cannot be English* counterparts of English\nsentences because they are not well-formed. Free-standing instances,\nthe objection goes, of the variables \u2018p\u2019 and\n\u2018q\u2019 cannot fill the argument-slots of\ntruth-functions, such as conjunction and material implication, which\nneed complete sentences as arguments. Free-standing uses of the\nvariables in \u2018and p\u2019 and \u2018then\nq\u2019 would lack a verb to complete these clauses into\ngenuine instances of the grammatical category of sentences.\nRamsey\u2019s reply insists on the sentential status of the variables\n\u2018p\u2019 and \u2018q\u2019, which stand for\nitems that already contain a verb and express a truth-bearer (loc.\ncit.).\n\nWhat Ramsey did not anticipate was the classification of his view\neither as a redundancy or as a pro-sentential theory. On the contrary,\nhe thought that it would be interpreted as a correspondence theory of\ntruth, and although he did not accept the metaphysical commitments of\nthe many versions of correspondentism, he did not reject the label\neither. In fact, he acknowledges that truth is objective\ncorrespondence to the facts (see for instance 1929c, [OT] 11; 1929d,\n36). Dokic and Engel (2002, 25) point out that Ramsey was a realist\nabout truth conditions and also about truth, but this realism was\nmodulated by his pragmatism: \u2018his kind of realism is distinct\nfrom the kind of realism which underlies a full-blown correspondence\ntheory of truth. It is a form of pragmatic realism, which associates\ntruth to beliefs-habits and to actions.\u2019 Thus, Ramsey\u2019s\ntake on truth has a pragmatist background, but it is not a pragmatist\nview of truth. It is a kind of sophisticated redundancy theory that is\nrealist about truth conditions, and also includes some of the\ntechnical apparatus that prosentential theories developed later on\n(see Williams 1976, Grover 1992, Brandom 1994, Fr\u00e1polli\n2013).\n5. Conditionals\n\nIn \u201cGeneral Propositions and Causality\u201d (1929b) Ramsey\nmade some remarks about conditional judgements, which have influenced\nthinking about conditionals since the 1960s. Most famous is this\nfootnote:\n\nIf two people are arguing \u2018If \\(p\\), will \\(q\\)?\u2019 and are\nboth in doubt about \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically to\ntheir stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\);\n\u2026 they are fixing their degrees of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\).\n(1929b, [FM] 247)\n\n\nTo understand what Ramsey means by \u201cdegree of belief in \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\)\u201d we need to turn to his earlier essay \u201cTruth\nand Probability\u201d (1926a), where he develops an interpretation of\nprobability as the logic of partial belief ([FM] 157). (Note, Ramsey\ndid not take this to be the only notion of probability: \u201cThe\nconclusions we shall come to as to the meaning of probability in Logic\nmust not \u2026 be taken as prejudging its meaning in physics\u201d\n(ibid.). The editor adds that a final chapter, on probability in\nscience, was designed but not written.) Here he introduces a\n\u201cvery useful new idea \u2013 \u2018the degree of belief in\n\\(q\\) given \\(p\\)\u2019\u201d (1926a, [FM] 180). One of his basic\nlaws is:\n\nDegree of belief in (\\(p\\) and \\(q\\)) = degree of belief in \\(p\\)\n\u00d7 degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) (1926a, [FM] 181)\n\n\nAs a law of probability, this was not new. It was in use since the\neighteenth century. It is needed to answer a compulsory question: how\nlikely is it that two events will happen? Answer: it is the\nprobability of the first, multiplied by the probability of the second\non the supposition that the first happens. What was novel in\nRamsey\u2019s essay was the interpretation of probability as degree\nof belief; and what was novel in the 1929 paper (1929b) was the\nlinking of \u201cdegree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)\u201d with\nour ordinary, typically uncertain, conditional judgements.\n\nExplaining \u201cdegree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)\u201d, Ramsey\nsays \u201cIt roughly expresses the odds at which [the subject] would\nnow bet on \\(q\\), the bet only to be valid if \\(p\\) is true\u201d\n(1926a, [FM] 180). Ramsey was aware that the link between degrees of\nbelief and betting behaviour is imperfect (1926a, [FM] 170). Here the\nmessage is that a conditional degree of belief is to a\nconditional bet, as an unconditional degree of belief is to\nan unconditional bet. For a bet on \\(q\\), you ask yourself, which is\nmore likely and by how much, \\(q\\) or \\(\\neg q\\)? For a bet on \\(q\\)\ngiven \\(p\\), you ask yourself, which is more likely, and by how much,\n\\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), or \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\)? If you judge \\(p\n\\:\\&\\: q\\) much more likely than \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), you have\na high degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\). Equivalently, under the\nhypothesis or supposition that \\(p\\), you judge it to be likely that\n\\(q\\).\n\nRamsey then warns against some possible misunderstandings of\n\u201cdegree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\)\u201d, which will be\ndiscussed below.\n\nThe main business of \u201cGeneral Propositions and Causality\u201d\nis to discuss the nature of causal generalisations, also called\nvariable hypotheticals \u2013 and naturally this leads him to discuss\ntheir singular conditional instances. He argues that \u201cvariable\nhypotheticals are not judgements but rules for judging \u2018If I\nmeet a \\(\\phi\\) I shall treat it as a \\(\\psi\\)\u2019. This cannot be\nnegated, but it can be disagreed with by one who\ndoes not adopt it\u201d (1929b, [FM] 241, italics original). There is\nemphasis throughout on the idea that these conditional judgements are\nnot propositions. After an example in which \\(A\\) says \u201cIf I eat\nthe pie I will get a stomach-ache\u201d and \\(B\\) disagrees, Ramsey\nwrites:\n\nMany sentences express cognitive attitudes without being propositions;\nand the difference between saying yes and no to them is not the\ndifference between saying yes or no to a proposition. This is even\ntrue of the ordinary hypothetical (as can be seen from the last\nexample, it asserts something for the case in which the [antecedent]\nis true: we apply the Law of Excluded Middle not to the whole thing\nbut to the [consequent] only). (1929b, [FM] 239\u2013240)\n\n\nLater, with the same example, \u201cit is not that he believes [a\nproposition] \\(p\\), we \\(\\overline{p}\\); but he has a different degree\nof belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) from ours; and we can obviously try to\nconvert him to our view\u201d (1929b, [FM] 247, followed by the\nfamous footnote). Here is another passage:\n\n\nWhen we deliberate about a possible action, we ask ourselves what will\nhappen if we do this or that. If we give a definite answer of the form\n\u2018If I do \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result\u2019, this can be properly\nregarded as a material implication or disjunction \u2018Either not\n\\(p\\), or \\(q\\)\u2019. But it differs, of course from any ordinary\ndisjunction in that one of its members is not something of which we\nare trying to discover the truth, but something within our power to\nmake true or false. \u2026\n\nBesides definite answers \u2018If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) will result\u2019, we\noften get ones \u2018If \\(p\\), \\(q\\) might result\u2019 or\n\u2018\\(q\\) would probably result\u2019. Here the degree of\nprobability is not a degree of belief in \u2018Not-\\(p\\) or\n\\(q\\)\u2019, but a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\), which it is\nevidently possible to have without a definite degree of belief in\n\\(p\\), \\(p\\) not being an intellectual problem. And our conduct is\nlargely determined by these degrees of hypothetical belief. (1929b,\n[FM] 246)\n\n\nTwo observations are in order: first, in the case of certainty that if\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), provided that \\(A\\) does not have probability 0, degree\nof belief in the material conditional and the conditional degree of\nbelief in \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) coincide. Writing \u201c\\(\\bel\\)\u201d\nfor degree of belief: if \\(\\bel(A \\amp \\neg B\\)) = 0 but \\(\\bel(A)\n\\neq 0\\), both \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) = 1\\) and \\(\\bel(B \\given A) = 1.\\)\nThe only other case in which they coincide is if \\(\\bel(A) = 1.\\)\nOtherwise, \\(\\bel(A \\supset B) \\gt \\bel(B \\given A),\\) radically so\nwhen \\(\\bel(B \\given A)\\) is low but \\(\\bel(\\neg A)\\) is high. Second,\nit is clear that Ramsey does not reductively define conditional degree\nof belief in terms of the ratio: \\(\\bel(A \\amp B)/\\bel(A),\\) for the\nconditional degree of belief can be assessed even without any specific\nvalue for \\(\\bel(A).\\) Indeed, in the fundamental law stated above,\nthe right-hand side is much more use as a route to the probability of\na conjunction, rather than the other way round.\n\nRamsey does not treat counterfactual conditionals in terms of\nconditional degrees of belief. The famous footnote continues:\n\nIf \\(p\\) turns out false, these degrees of belief are rendered\nvoid. If either party believes \u00ac\\(p\\) for certain, the\nquestion ceases to mean anything to him except as a question about\nwhat follows from certain laws or hypotheses.\n\n\nThat is, a degree of belief in \\(q\\) given \\(p\\) exists only when the\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) is non-zero. Ramsey does make a few remarks\nabout counterfactuals, noticing the \u2018subtle syntactic\nvariations\u2019. For instance, \u201cIf he was there, he must have\nvoted for it (for it was passed unanimously), but if he had been\nthere, he would have voted against it (such being his nature)\u201d\n(1929b, [FM] 249). (Here we have an early precursor of the\nOswald-Kennedy pair: if Oswald didn\u2019t do it, someone else did;\nbut if Oswald hadn\u2019t done it, no one else would have; see Adams\n1970.) There are a few remarks about counterfactuals in Ramsey\u2019s\npaper but no settled view of them is presented.\n\nBruno de Finetti (1937, based on lectures of 1935), shortly after\nRamsey and independently, also developed an account of probability as\ndegree of belief. (Unlike Ramsey, de Finetti argued that this was the\nonly kind of probability.) In a separate lecture (1936) he gave a\ntheory of \u201cconditional events\u201d or \u201ctri-events\u201d\nas he called them. Like Ramsey, he provided an account of conditional\njudgements in terms of conditional probabilities, and gave a\nthree-valued account of such a conditional \u201cif \\(p\\),\n\\(q\\)\u201d: true if \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), false if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg\nq\\), void if \\(\\neg p\\). He also connects this with conditional bets:\nwon if \\(p \\:\\&\\: q\\), lost if \\(p \\:\\&\\: \\neg q\\), called off\nif \\(\\neg p\\). He gives three-valued truth tables for the other\nconnectives when applied to conditionals, and claims that the\nprobability of a \u201ctri-event\u201d is the probability of its\ntruth given that it has a truth value \u2013 which, in the case of\n\u201cif \\(p\\), \\(q\\)\u201d is just the probability of \\(q\\) given\n\\(p\\). The results for more complex sentences are controversial, but\nthere has been a fair amount of work in this tradition, much of it\nsummarised by Peter Milne (1997). It is interesting that this second\nexposition of probability as degree of belief also connected\nconditional degree of belief to ordinary conditional judgements, and\nalso recognised that the latter could not then be treated as ordinary\npropositions.\n\nErnest Adams wrote two papers (1965, 1966), and later a book (1975)\ndeveloping a logic for conditionals assessed as conditional\nprobabilities. Like Ramsey, he was sceptical of the idea of\nconditionals as propositions with truth conditions, and developed a\nlogic based on probability. He showed that valid arguments have an\ninteresting probability-preserving property: the uncertainty (i.e. 1\n\u2212 the probability) of the conclusion cannot exceed the sum of\nthe uncertainties of the premises. He applied this criterion to\narguments with conditionals, and an interesting logic emerged. The\nparadoxes of material implication are invalid. Specifically, with\nmaterial implication, \\(\\neg A\\) guarantees the truth of \\(A \\to B\\).\nBut here, the probability of \\(\\neg A\\) can be high while the\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is low. (\\(B\\) given \\(A\\) is the\nanalog of \\(A \\to B\\).) More surprisingly, there are counterexamples\nto transitivity, contraposition, and strengthening of the antecedent\n(see Section 3.2 of the entry on\n indicative conditionals,\n for examples and more details).\n\nRobert Stalnaker\u2019s first paper on the subject, \u201cA Theory\nof Conditionals\u201d, appeared in 1968. Stalnaker refers to Ramsey.\nHe also mentions Adams (1966) in a footnote, and indicates that he\nwill devote another paper to the probabilistic aspects of the theory.\nThis is his \u201cProbability and Conditionals\u201d (1970), and its\nabstract announces that \u201cconditional propositions are introduced\nas propositions whose absolute probability is equal to the conditional\nprobability of the consequent given the antecedent\u201d. Then David\nLewis (1976) proved that there is no proposition the probability of\nwhose truth can be systematically equated with the conditional\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\) \u2013 a result which Ramsey and de\nFinetti appear to have foreseen.\n\nProbability is not discussed in the 1968 paper, but Adams\u2019s\nlogic is in the background as a guide: it turns out that\nStalnaker\u2019s logic coincides with Adams over their common domain\n(Adams puts aside sentences in which conditionals are embedded in\nother connectives). Thus, for example, Stalnaker also has the\ncounterexamples to transitivity, contraposition and strengthening of\nthe antecedent (1968, 48\u20139).\n\nStalnaker puts Ramsey\u2019s suggestion thus: \u201cadd the\nantecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of knowledge (or beliefs),\nand then consider whether the consequent is true. Your belief about\nthe conditional should be the same as your hypothetical belief, under\nthis condition, in the consequent\u201d (1968, 43).\n\nStalnaker was interested in a theory which covered both indicative\nconditionals and counterfactual conditionals. He held that something\nsimilar happened with the latter:\n\n\nFirst, add the antecedent (hypothetically) to your stock of beliefs;\nsecond, make whatever adjustments are required to maintain consistency\n(without modifying the hypothetical belief in the antecedent);\nfinally, consider whether the consequent is then true.\n\n\u2026 Now we have found an answer to the question, \u201cHow do we\ndecide whether or not to believe a conditional statement?\u201d the\nproblem is to make the transition from belief conditions to truth\nconditions; that is, to find a set of truth conditions for statements\nhaving conditional form which explains why we use the method we do use\nto evaluate them. The concept of a possible world is just\nwhat we need to make this transition, since a possible world is the\nanalogue of a stock of hypothetical beliefs. The following set of\ntruth conditions, using this notion, is a first approximation to the\naccount that I shall propose:\n\nConsider a possible world in which \\(A\\) is true, and which otherwise\ndiffers minimally from the actual world. \u201cIf A, then\nB\u201d is true (false) just in case B is\ntrue (false) in that possible world.\n(44\u201345, italics original)\n\n\nAnd close-possible-world semantics for conditionals was born.\n\nA consequence of Stalnaker\u2019s setting the probabilistic\nconsiderations aside in his influential 1968 paper is that\nRamsey\u2019s idea came to be taken differently: it was applied in\nthe context of full, all-or-nothing belief; it was applied to\ncounterfactuals as well as indicatives; and consequently, there was\nmuch emphasis on belief revision. The phrase \u201cthe\nRamsey Test\u201d was coined by William Harper (1975, 1976), and it\ncaught on. He explains it thus: \u201cAccept \u2018if \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)\u2019 if and only if the minimum revision of your system of\nbeliefs needed to accept \\(A\\) also requires accepting \\(B\\)\u201d\n(1975, 245; 1976, 118). Peter G\u00e4rdenfors (1986, 81) says the\nsame. Sven Ove Hansson (1992) says \u201cIn modern studies of belief\ndynamics, the Ramsey test is taken to \u2018presume \u2026 some\nmethod of revising states of belief\u2019 [quoting G\u00e4rdenfors].\nThus \u2018If \\(p\\) then \\(q\\)\u2019 is taken to be believed if and\nonly if \\(q\\) would be believed in the belief state that would result\nfrom revising the present belief state by \\(p\\)\u201d (1992, 522).\nStephen Read says \u201cRamsey\u2019s idea was simple, but\nappealing. One should believe a conditional \u2018If \\(A\\),\n\\(B\\)\u2019 if one would come to believe \\(B\\) if one were to add\n\\(A\\) to one\u2019s stock of beliefs\u201d (1995, 47).\n\nThis emphasis on belief revision is not found in\nRamsey\u2019s work. Indeed, he distances himself from that idea. On\nthe page where he introduces \u201cdegree of belief in \\(q\\) given\n\\(p\\)\u201d, Ramsey writes:\n\nThis does not mean the degree of belief which the subject would have\nin \\(q\\) is he knew \\(p\\), or that which he ought to have. \u2026\n[And again] This is not the same as the degree he would believe \\(q\\),\nif he believed \\(p\\) for certain; for knowledge of \\(p\\) might for\npsychological reasons profoundly alter his whole system of beliefs.\n(1926a, [FM] 180)\n\n\nThus, for Ramsey conditional degree of belief is a synchronic notion,\nnot a diachronic one. It is a feature of one\u2019s present\nbelief-state, not to be defined in terms of how one\u2019s\nbelief-state would change on acquiring more information.\n\nWhy did Ramsey issue these warnings? Here is one example which may be\nwhat he had in mind. Mary is an atheist. However, if she were to learn\nthat she had a fatal disease, she would acquire a belief in God. But\nshe doesn\u2019t now believe \u201cIf I get a fatal disease, there\nis a God\u201d! Another example: I am about to pick a card and look\nat it. I know there are three kings in the pile, two red and one\nblack. My conditional degree of belief that I pick a red card, given\nthat I pick a king, is 2/3. That determines the odds on which I would\nbet on Red given King. But if I do pick a king, I won\u2019t have a\ndegree of belief 2/3 that it is red. I am not colour blind. Then there\nexamples like Lewis\u2019s \u201cIf Reagan was in the pay of the\nKGB, we\u2019ll never find out\u201d. This is something he believes.\nBut if he were to learn the antecedent, he would not then believe the\nconsequent! As Lewis says, \u201cIt might be no easy thing to judge\nwhat would be learned if [\\(A\\)] were learned, in view of the variety\nof ways that something might be learned\u201d (1986, 156). He\nconcludes that a conditional degree of belief is a good but fallible\nguide to the degree of belief you would have in \\(B\\) if you learned\n\\(A\\). Edgington\u2019s (1995) reply to Read, \u00a71, discusses the\ndisparity between what Ramsey himself said, and much that goes under\nthe name \u201cthe Ramsey Test\u201d. In the famous footnote, Ramsey\nspeaks of people \u201cadding \\(p\\) hypothetically to their\nstock of knowledge\u201d \u2013 that is, supposing that \\(p\\). The\nconsequences of doing so for one\u2019s conditional beliefs, is not\ninvariably equivalent to the consequences of coming to believe \\(p\\),\nfor one\u2019s unconditional beliefs.\n\nMany philosophers have followed the path along which Ramsey took the\nfirst steps, and Adams developed \u2013 of understanding our\ntypically uncertain conditional judgements in terms of conditional\ndegrees of belief (see Edgington 2014 for more details and\nreferences).\n6. Partial Belief and Subjective Probability\n\nIn \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 (1926a), Ramsey sets out an\ninfluential account of the nature, measurement, and norms of partial\nbelief. The essay is a pioneering work on subjectivist\ninterpretations of probability (also known as personalist\ninterpretations; see the entry on\n interpretations of probability).\n According to subjectivism, probabilities can be interpreted as\nnumerical representations of an individual\u2019s subjective degrees\nof confidence. First written in 1926 and still incomplete at the time\nof its publication in 1931 (a year after Ramsey\u2019s death),\n\u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 was not very widely discussed\nuntil after the publication of Savage\u2019s The Foundations of\nStatistics (1954), at which time subjectivism came to prominence.\nMany of the key ideas and arguments original to the essay have\nreappeared in later foundational works in the subjectivist tradition\n(e.g., de Finetti 1937, Savage 1954, Jeffrey 1965). This section\noutlines some of Ramsey\u2019s major contributions to this tradition,\nfocusing primarily on the procedure he suggests for measuring\nsubjective probability.\n\nRamsey\u2019s central goal in \u2018Truth and Probability\u2019 is\nto show that the laws of probability provide us with a \u2018logic of\npartial belief\u2019. That is, the laws specify necessary conditions\non any consistent set of partial beliefs, in a manner analogous to how\nthe laws of classical logic might be taken to generate necessary\nconditions on any consistent set of full beliefs. The argument for\nthis claim is grounded in Ramsey\u2019s subjectivist approach to\nprobability. The essay begins, however, with a discussion of the two\nmajor approaches to understanding probabilities at the time in\nCambridge: frequentism, and a version of the logical interpretation\nput forward by the economist John Maynard Keynes in A Treatise on\nProbability (1921).\n\nRegarding frequentism \u2013 according to which the probability of an\nevent is the relative frequency with which that type of event occurs,\nor would occur, over repeated trials \u2013 Ramsey adopts a\nconciliatory tone. For many cases (e.g., coin flips and rolls of a\ndie), frequencies provide a natural interpretation of the probability\ncalculus, but they are insufficiently general for Ramsey\u2019s\npurposes and relate not to the consistency of partial beliefs but to\ntheir reasonableness. (We\u2019ll return to the role of frequencies\nin Ramsey\u2019s theory below.) On the other hand, Ramsey presents a\ndetailed critique of Keynes\u2019 theory. According to Keynes,\nprobabilities are an objective and quantifiable relation between\npropositions \u2013 roughly, the probability of an hypothesis \\(h\\),\ngiven evidence \\(e\\), is the degree to which \\(h\\) is logically\nimplied by \\(e\\). Importantly, Keynes\u2019 assumed that this\nrelation could be perceived through intuition \u2013 to which Ramsey\nobjects:\n\n\n[T]here really do not seem to be any such things as the probability\nrelations [Keynes] describes. He supposes that, at any rate in certain\ncases, they can be perceived; but speaking for myself I feel confident\nthat this is not true. I do not perceive them\u2026 moreover I\nshrewdly suspect that others do not perceive them either, because they\nare able to come to so very little agreement as to which of them\nrelates any two given propositions. (1926a, [FM] 161)\n\n\nFor example, for even very simple pairs of propositions (such as\n\u2018This is red\u2019 and \u2018That is blue\u2019), where one\nmight have expected objective relations to be more readily accessible,\nthere is very little agreement as to what probability relation might\nconnect them. Ramsey also notes that, while most people will agree\nthat the probability of a fair coin landing heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n\u2018we can none of us say exactly what is the evidence which forms\nthe other term for the probability relation about which we are then\njudging\u2019 (1926a, [FM] 162).\n\nHaving dismissed Keynes\u2019 theory, Ramsey moves on to his\nalternative, subjectivist view. The guiding idea throughout is\nthat:\n\n\n[T]he degree of a belief is a causal property of it, which we can\nexpress vaguely as the extent to which we are prepared to act on it.\n(1926a, [FM] 169)\n\n\nThat is, partial beliefs are connected to choice and action, in that\nthe more confidence one has in a proposition \\(p\\), the more willing\none will be to choose those options that lead to favourable outcomes\nunder the assumption that \\(p\\) is true. Although he does not say much\nabout the nature of this connection in \u2018Truth and\nProbability,\u2019 in \u2018Facts and Propositions\u2019 (1927a,\n170) Ramsey expresses sympathy for the pragmatist view according to\nwhich a full belief that \\(p\\) just is a set of actions that\ntends to lead to favourable outcomes at worlds where \\(p\\) is\ntrue:\n\n\nIt is, for instance, possible to say that a chicken believes a certain\nsort of caterpillar to be poisonous, and mean by that merely that it\nabstains from eating such caterpillars on account of unpleasant\nexperiences connected with them. The mental factors in such a belief\nwould be parts of the chicken\u2019s behaviour\u2026 Thus any set\nof actions for whose utility \\(p\\) is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition might be called a belief that \\(p\\)\u2026 (1927a, [FM]\n144)\n\n\nIt is plausible that Ramsey intended a similar account for partial\nbeliefs \u2013 that partial beliefs either are patterns of\nbehaviour, or perhaps behavioural dispositions, or that they\u2019re\notherwise definable primarily in terms of such things. In any case,\nRamsey recognised that, if this vague connection between belief and\nchoice could be suitably precisified, then it could be used to build a\ndefinition of degrees of belief in terms of choices.\n\nLike other quantities throughout the sciences, Ramsey argues,\n\u2018the degree of a belief\u2026 has no precise meaning unless we\nspecify more exactly how it is to be measured\u2019 (1926a, [FM]\n167). To precisify his account, therefore, Ramsey sketches a procedure\nfor the measurement of partial belief, which includes as an initial\npart also the measurement of desires (or \u2018utilities\u2019). The\nprocedure takes as input the subject\u2019s preferences over\n\nworlds, or more accurately propositions that are\nmaximally specific with respect to matters the subject cares about,\nand\ngambles, including especially binary gambles of the form\n\u2018world \\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\), and world \\(\\omega_2\\)\notherwise\u2019, and ternary gambles of the form \u2018\\(\\omega_1\\)\nif \\(p \\amp q\\), \\(\\omega_2\\) if \\(p \\amp \\neg{q}\\), and \\(\\omega_3\\)\notherwise\u2019.\n\n\nWith those as inputs, the procedure supplies precise numerical\nrepresentations of her partial beliefs and utilities provided the\nagents\u2019 preferences satisfy a number of \u2018coherence\u2019\nrequirements. The procedure can be roughly summarised as follows.\nFirst, we elicit the subject\u2019s preferences by offering her a\nsequence of choices between pairs of worlds and/or gambles. Then, on\nthe assumption that the subject is an expected utility maximiser, we\ncan use her preferences to determine her numerical utilities. Given\nher utilities, we can finally define the subject\u2019s degree of\nbelief towards the proposition \\(p\\) in terms of her utilities for\ngambles conditional on \\(p\\). The following paragraphs will briefly\ndiscuss these three steps in turn. More thorough treatments of\nRamsey\u2019s procedure can be found in Sahlin 1990, Bradley 2001,\nand Elliott 2017; see also Neth 2019 for an extension of the Ramseyan\nprocedure beyond expected utility theory.\n\nRegarding the first step, which requires us to elicit the\nsubject\u2019s preferences, Ramsey says:\n\n\n[Suppose] that our subject has certain beliefs about everything; then\nhe will act so that what he believes to be the total consequences of\nhis action will be the best possible. If then we had the power of the\nAlmighty, and could persuade our subject of our power, we could, by\noffering him options, discover how he placed in order of merit all\npossible courses of the world\u2026 Suppose next that the subject is\ncapable of doubt; then we could test his degree of belief in different\npropositions by making him offers of the following kind. Would you\nrather have world [\\(\\omega_1\\)] in any event; or world [\\(\\omega_2\\)]\nif \\(p\\) is true, and world [\\(\\omega_3\\)] if \\(p\\) is false? (1926a,\n[FM] 177)\n\n\nA common objection to this early stage of the procedure is that if the\nexperimenter were to convince their subject that they \u2018had the\npower of the Almighty\u2019, then this would radically alter the\nbeliefs supposedly being measured (e.g., Jeffrey 1983, 158\u201360;\ncf. Sobel 1998, 255\u20136; Bradley 2001, \u00a73.2; Eriksson &\nRabinowicz 2013). A measurement procedure can be considered accurate\nonly if it doesn\u2019t itself significantly alter the measurand.\nMeasurement procedures usually involve some unavoidable\nchange to the quantity being measured \u2013 placing a cold\nthermometer into a hot liquid will slightly cool the liquid, for\nexample, but for most purposes this effect is negligible. The\nobjection at hand is therefore that merely having the subject come\nto believe that they have some choice over these worlds and\ngambles will generally involve a substantial change to their\nbeliefs \u2013 enough to undermine the accuracy of Ramsey\u2019s\nprocedure. For example, the process might alter the subject\u2019s\nbeliefs regarding the claim \u2018Experimenters have the capacity to\nmake it the case that \\(\\omega_1\\) obtains if \\(p\\) is true, and\n\\(\\omega_2\\) obtains otherwise\u2019, with potentially many ripple on\neffects through to her other beliefs. Interestingly, Ramsey makes note\nof a similar problem for an alternative procedure (1926a, [FM] 170),\nthough does not discuss the worry as it arises for his own\nproposal.\n\nThe second step of Ramsey\u2019s procedure takes us from preferences\nto utilities. This step is the most complicated, and it requires a\nsuite of background assumptions about the partial beliefs, utilities,\nand preferences of the subject. In his words,\n\n\nI propose to take as a basis a general psychological theory, which is\nnow universally discarded, but nevertheless comes, I think, fairly\nclose to the truth in the sort of cases with which we are most\nconcerned. I mean the theory that we act in the way we think most\nlikely to realize the objects of our desires, so that a person\u2019s\nactions are completely determined by his desires and opinions. (1926a,\n[FM] 174)\n\n\nRamsey\u2019s point here is that, given some background psychological\nassumptions, it will be possible \u2013 at least sometimes \u2013 to\nspecify exactly what a subject\u2019s degrees of belief and\nutilities are once we have enough information about her preferences.\nHowever, Ramsey leaves the details of this \u2018general\npsychological theory\u2019 almost entirely implicit. We can clarify\nmatters on his behalf by breaking the theory into three parts:\n\nFirst, there exists a function \\(\\varphi\\) that associates gambles\nwith real numbers, such that the subject weakly prefers a gamble\n\\(\\gamma_1\\) to another gamble \\(\\gamma_2\\) just in case\n\\(\\varphi(\\gamma_1)\\geq\\varphi(\\gamma_2)\\)\nSecond, this function \\(\\varphi\\) \u2018decomposes\u2019 into\ntwo further real-valued functions \\(\\bel\\) and \\(des,\\) in the sense\nthat if \\(\\gamma\\) is the binary gamble \n\u2018\\(\\omega_1\\) if\n\\(p\\), \\(\\omega_2\\)\nif \\(\\neg{p}\\)\u2019 then\n\\(\\varphi(\\gamma) =\nbel(p){\\cdot}des(\\omega_1\\&{}p) +\n(1-bel(p)){\\cdot}des(\\omega_2\\&\\neg{}p)\\)\n(and likewise for ternary gambles, mutatis\n  mutandis)\nThird, \\(bel\\) and \\(des\\) represent the subject\u2019s\npartial beliefs and utilities respectively; for instance,\n\\(bel(p)\\geq\\bel(q)\\) just in case the subject\u2019s degree of\nbelief towards \\(p\\) is at least as great as their degree of belief\ntowards \\(q\\), and likewise \\(des(p)\\geq{}des(q)\\) just in case the\nsubject desires that \\(p\\) at least as much as they desire that\n\\(q\\)\n\n\nIn other words, Ramsey assumes that our preferences conform to the\nrule of expected utility maximisation, where the expected\nutility of a gamble is given by the weighted average of the utilities\nof its outcomes, the weights being provided by the subject\u2019s\ndegrees of belief. While Ramsey recognised that these assumptions\ninvolve some idealisation, he justifies them by noting that the\ndevelopment of any measurement process \u2018cannot be accomplished\nwithout introducing a certain amount of hypothesis or fiction\u2019\n(1926a, [FM] 168), and that the assumptions come close enough to the\ntruth to render them still useful (1926a, [FM] 173).\n\nThe reasoning by which we go from preferences to a numerical\nrepresentation of utilities is complicated, and in Ramsey\u2019s\npaper mostly left unstated. It begins with the notion of an\nethically neutral proposition, which can here be defined\nas:\n\nEthical Neutrality: \\(p\\) is ethically\nneutral for a subject iff, for all worlds \\(\\omega\\) consistent\nwith \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg{p}\\), the subject is indifferent between\n\\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega \\amp p\\), and \\(\\omega \\amp \\neg{p}\\).\n\nThat is, a proposition \\(p\\) is ethically neutral if the truth or\nfalsity of \\(p\\) is a matter of indifference to the subject,\nregardless of the wider context in which its truth or falsity obtains.\nHaving characterised ethical neutrality in terms of preferences,\nRamsey uses it to construct a definition (in terms of preferences over\ngambles) for when the difference in utility between two\nworlds \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is equal to the\ndifference in utility between \\(\\omega_3\\) and\n \\(\\omega_4\\).[2]\n This equal differences in utility definition provides Ramsey\nwith the resources needed to sketch a representation theorem,\nwhich constitutes the centrepiece of his paper. According to this\ntheorem, the subject\u2019s preferences over worlds and gambles will\nsatisfy eight relatively simple conditions (or \u2018axioms\u2019)\nonly if there exists at least one function, \\(des\\), which represents\nthe subject\u2019s preferences over worlds in the sense that\n\\(\\omega_1\\) is weakly preferred to \\(\\omega_2\\) if and only if\n\\(des(\\omega_1) \\geq des(\\omega_2)\\). Moreover, this function will be \nunique up to positive linear transformations \u2013 that is, for any\nother function \\(des^*\\) with the same property, \\(des^*(x) =\ndes(x)r+c \\) (for some positive real number \\(r\\) and constant \\(c\\)).\nAs such, \\(des\\) is an interval scale representation:\na numerical scale in which intervals of differences are\nmeaningful. For instance, the difference in utility between\n\\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is at least as great as that between\n\\(\\omega_3\\) and \\(\\omega_4\\) just in case \\(des(\\omega_1) -\ndes(\\omega_2) \\geq des(\\omega_3) - des(\\omega_4) \\). (Other examples\nof interval scales include temperatures as measured in degrees Celsius\nor Fahrenheit, and yearly dates as measured in the A.D. and Buddhist\nor Hindu systems.) Given Ramsey\u2019s background \u2018general\npsychological theory\u2019, the implication is that the\nsubject\u2019s preferences will satisfy Ramsey\u2019s eight axioms\nonly if this function \\(des\\) represents her utilities on an interval\nscale.\n\nIncluded among Ramsey\u2019s eight axioms are some obvious coherence\nconditions, such as that preferences ought to be transitive. But the\naxioms also include some less obvious conditions, for instance that\nfor any pair of worlds \\(\\omega_1\\), \\(\\omega_2\\), there\u2019s a\nfurther world \\(\\omega_3\\) whose utility is exactly halfway between\nthat of \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\). There has been very little\nempirical investigation into Ramsey\u2019s axioms, primarily due to\nthe widespread opinion that his representation result has been\nsuperseded by the results of Savage (1954) and later decision\ntheorists (see, e.g., Fishburn 1981). However, Ramsey\u2019s\nassumption that there exists an ethically neutral proposition (needed\nfor the definition of equal differences in utility to make sense) has\nattracted substantial critical discussion. Ramsey does not discuss any\nreasons to believe that even one ethically neutral proposition exists,\nstill less that their existence is a precondition for the\nconsistency of partial beliefs. For more discussion,\nincluding on why ethically neutral propositions are problematic for\nRamsey\u2019s proposal and whether they\u2019re necessary for it,\nsee Sobel 1998, Bradley 2001, Eriksson & H\u00e1jek 2007, and\nElliott 2017. A further question concerns whether this stage of\nRamsey\u2019s procedure presupposes the controversial\n\u2018deliberation crowds out prediction\u2019 thesis, according to\nwhich an agent deliberating about an action cannot have meaningful\ndegrees of belief regarding whether she will perform that action; see\nLiu & Price (2020) for discussion and Rabinowicz (2002) for a\ncritique of the thesis.\n\nThe third and final stage of Ramsey\u2019s measurement procedure\ntakes us from the subject\u2019s utilities to a definition of her\ndegrees of belief:\n\n\nHaving thus defined a way of measuring value we can now derive a way\nof measuring belief in general. If the option of [\\(\\omega_2\\)] for\ncertain is indifferent with that of [\u2018\\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\),\n\\(\\omega_3\\) otherwise\u2019], we can define the subject\u2019s\ndegree of belief in \\(p\\) as the ratio of the difference between\n[\\(\\omega_2\\)] and [\\(\\omega_3\\)] to that between [\\(\\omega_1\\)] and\n[\\(\\omega_3\\)]. (1926a, [FM] 179)\n\n\nIn a footnote, Ramsey adds that \\(\\omega_1\\) must imply \\(p\\), and\n\\(\\omega_3\\) must imply \\(\\neg{p}\\). The definition follows from the\nbackground assumption of the \u2018general psychological\ntheory\u2019 mentioned above: the world \\(\\omega_2\\) has the same\nutility as the gamble \u2018\\(\\omega_1\\) if \\(p\\), \\(\\omega_3\\)\notherwise\u2019 just in case \n\\[des(\\omega_2) = bel(p)des(\\omega_1) + (1 - bel(p))des(\\omega_3)\\]\n\n\nWhere \\(des(\\omega_1) \\neq des(\\omega_3)\\), this equality can be\nrearranged to give a definition of \\(bel(p)\\)as follows:\n\n\\[bel(p) = \\frac{des(\\omega_2) - des(\\omega_3)}{des(\\omega_1) - des(\\omega_3)}\\]\n\n\nAs Ramsey notes,\n\n\nThis amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief in \\(p\\) by the\nodds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet being conducted\nin terms of differences of value as defined. (1926a, [FM]\n179\u201380)\n\n\nRamsey\u2019s definition of conditional probability (1926a, [FM] 180)\nfollows an essentially similar strategy. Having thus outlined his\nstrategy for defining degrees of belief, Ramsey proves that from his\npreference conditions and subsequent definitions, the following\n\u2018laws of probability\u2019 follow: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n&bel(p) + bel(\\neg p) = 1\\\\\n &bel(p \\,|\\, q) + \\bel(\\neg p \\,|\\, q) = 1\\\\\n &bel(p \\amp q) = bel(p)bel(q \\,|\\, p)\\\\\n &bel(p \\amp q) + bel(p \\amp \\neg q) = bel(p)\\\\\n &bel(p \\,\\vee\\, q) = bel(p) + bel(q), \\text{where }p\\amp q\\text{ is impossible} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nRamsey goes on to say:\n\n\nThese are the laws of probability, which we have proved to be\nnecessarily true of any consistent set of degrees of belief. Any\ndefinite set of degrees of belief which broke them would be\ninconsistent in the sense that it violated the laws of preference\nbetween options\u2026 (1926a, [FM] 182)\n\n\nIn this passage we find an early version of what has come to be known\nas a representation theorem argument for probabilistic norms\non partial belief and for expected utility theory, of the kind later\nmade popular by Savage. (See also Skyrms 1987, Hajek 2008, and the\nentry on\n normative theories of rational choice: expected utility,\n \u00a72.2, for discussion). It is dubious, however, that Ramsey\n\u2018proved\u2019 that the stated laws must be true of any\nconsistent set of partial beliefs, even where\n\u2018consistency\u2019 is understood as being tied to the\n\u2018laws of preference\u2019 in the manner that Ramsey suggests.\nAmong the axioms of his representation theorem are some (like those\nregarding the ethically neutral proposition) which are not plausible\nas conditions of the consistency on those preferences.\nFurthermore, Ramsey\u2019s \u2018proof\u2019 requires substantive\npsychological assumptions about the connection between partial beliefs\nand preferences, which Ramsey admits are idealizations. Even if those\nassumptions happen to be true as a matter of fact, though, or close to\nthe truth, they are presupposed in the derivation and require\nindependent justification.\n\nImmediately following, Ramsey also states that:\n\n\nIf anyone\u2019s mental condition violated these laws, his choice\nwould depend on the precise form in which the options were offered\nhim, which would be absurd. He could have a book made against him by a\ncunning better and would then stand to lose in any event. (1926a, [FM]\n182)\n\n\nThe reasoning behind this claim is never made explicit, though it is\nevident that Ramsey was putting forward what has come to be known as a\nDutch Book Argument, later made more precise by de Finetti (1937; see\nthe entry on\n Dutch book arguments\n for details).\n\nHaving established what he takes to be the conditions of\nconsistency for partial beliefs, Ramsey concludes his paper\nwith a lengthy discussion on what (in addition) might make a set of\npartial beliefs reasonable (as opposed to just\nconsistent). He proposes a condition of calibration,\nor fit with known frequencies:\n\n\nLet us take a habit of forming opinion in a certain way; e.g. the\nhabit of proceeding from the opinion that a toadstool is yellow to the\nopinion that it is unwholesome. Then we can accept the fact that the\nperson has a habit of this sort, and ask merely what degree of opinion\nthat the toadstool is unwholesome it would be best for him to\nentertain when he sees it\u2026 And the answer is that it will in\ngeneral be best for his degree of belief that a yellow toadstool is\nunwholesome to be equal to the proportion of yellow toadstools which\nare in fact unwholesome. (This follows from the meaning of degree of\nbelief.) (1926a, [FM] 195)\n\n\nSo, for example, if 1 in 100 yellow toadstools is unwholesome, then\nceteris paribus one should believe that this\ntoadstool is unwholesome, given that it is yellow, to degree\n\\(0.01\\).Something like this condition has reappeared in a number of\nlater works (e.g., Shimony 1988; Lewis 1980); see the entry on\n Interpretations of Probability,\n \u00a73.3.4, for more discussion.\n\nIt would be hard to understate the importance of the above ideas to\nthe subjectivist tradition. It is a major testament to the originality\nof Ramsey\u2019s essay that it contains not only the first\nappearances of two of the main contemporary arguments for\nprobabilistic norms on partial belief, but also an influential case\nfor a normative link between partial beliefs and known frequencies.\nFurthermore, most attempts to characterise degrees of belief in the\nsubjectivist tradition have made central appeal to their connection\nwith preferences. (See de Finetti 1937, Savage 1954, Anscombe &\nAumann 1963, Maher 1993, Elliott 2021; for criticisms of the approach,\nsee Joyce 1999, \u00a71.3; Eriksson & H\u00e1jek 2007; Meacham\n& Weisberg 2011; Stef\u00e1nsson 2017.) Indeed, in much of\nphilosophy, economics and psychology still today, the default or\northodox way to operationalise degrees of belief is in terms of\nchoices, along essentially the same lines that Ramsey put forward.\n7. Laws and Theories\n\nRamsey\u2019s main contributions to the philosophy of science stem\nfrom three posthumously published papers written in 1928 and 1929, one\non theoretical terms in theories and two on the distinction between\n(in modern terminology) laws of nature and accidental\ngeneralizations.\n7.1 Laws\n\nIn both papers on laws, Ramsey (1928b, \u00a72; 1929b, [FM]\n237\u201338) considers accidental generalization to be conjunctions\n([NP], n. 40; cf. Ramsey 1927a, [FM] 152\u201353) and thus normal\npropositions (for the relation to Wittgenstein, see\n \u00a72).\n In \u201cUniversals of Law and Fact\u201d, Ramsey (1928b, \u00a712)\nconsiders laws of nature to be propositions with a special status:\n\n[E]ven if we knew everything, we should still want to systematize our\nknowledge as a deductive system, and the general axioms in that system\nwould be the fundamental laws of nature. The choice of axioms is bound\nto some extent to be arbitrary, but what is less likely to be\narbitrary if any simplicity is to be preserved is a body of\nfundamental generalizations, some to be taken as axioms and others\ndeduced.\n\n\nThus laws of nature are the axioms and theorems in the simplest\naxiomatization of all of our knowledge. And while we currently do not\nknow everything, we can still find the simplest axiomatization for\nwhat we do know and what we expect to come to know (\u00a716).\nFollowing Lewis (1973 [1986], \u00a73.3), a similar view of laws has\nbeen developed and discussed as the \u201cBest System\u201d account\nof laws, which, however, does not demand that we find the simplest\naxiomatization of all our knowledge, but rather of as much of\nour knowledge as is possible while retaining a high enough level of\nsimplicity (see also Carroll 2016, \u00a72).\n\n\u201cGeneral Propositions and Causality\u201d, written in the\nsummer of 1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii) and with additional notes from\nSeptember 1929 ([NP] note 74), explicitly retracts the view that laws\n(here called \u2018variable hypotheticals\u2019) are propositions\n(1929b, [FM] 238; for the relation to Weyl, see\n \u00a72).\n Rather (1929b, [FM] 241):\n\nVariable hypotheticals are not judgments but rules for judging\n\u2018If I meet a \\(\\phi\\), I shall regard it as a \\(\\psi\\)\u2019.\nThis cannot be negated but it can be disagreed with\nby one who does not adopt it.\n\n\nThus variable hypotheticals \u201cform the system with which the\nspeaker meets the future\u201d in that \u201cwe trust [a conjunction\nof their instances] to guide us in a new instance\u201d exactly\nbecause the conjunction is evidence for the variable hypothetical.\nSimplicity may still play a role, but not as constitutive of laws (as\nin the earlier, Best System account), rather only as epistemic\njustification for adopting a rule of judgment (1929b, [FM] 242). This\nallows again for the non-arbitrariness if not uniqueness of laws.\nUnknown laws are those rules of judgment whose adoption is justified\nby unknown facts (1929b, [FM] 243\u201345).\n\nIn both papers, \u2018if \u2026 then \u2026\u2019 statements,\ncalled \u2018conditionals\u2019, are taken to differ from material\nimplications in that they can be inferred from the system of laws\n(1928b, \u00a715; 1929b, [FM] 248). Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 249) takes\nconditionals to encompass both the indicative and subjunctive mood\n(see \u00a75 on Conditionals) and he identifies causal laws with\nconditionals in which the event described in the antecedent takes\nplace before the event described in the consequent.\n\nRamsey\u2019s earlier, Best System account of laws fits well with\nHumean constraints of metaphysics (Carroll 2016, \u00a72), and Ramsey\n(1929b, [FM] 252\u201353; 254\u201355, n. 4) is explicit that his\nlater, non-propositional account of laws avoids \u201creal\nconnections of universals\u201d and is in the spirit of Hume. At\nfirst Ramsey (1928b, \u00a715) even states that the material\nimplication is all we practically need, while later acknowledging that\nconditionals are necessary for assigning praise and blame (1929b, [FM]\n245\u201346).\n7.2 Theories\n\nHis non-propositional account of laws, Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 254, n. 2)\nnotes, renders theoretical laws twice removed from propositions:\n\n[Laws] are used in the same way in a theoretical system as in a\nprimary system; cause, too, if the theoretical system is temporal. Of\ncourse the theoretical system is all like a variable hypothetical in\nbeing there just to be deduced from; and a law in the theoretical\nsystem is at two removes of deduction.\n\n\nIn his paper \u201cTheories\u201d (1929a), written in the summer of\n1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii), Ramsey calls the observational language\n\u2018primary system\u2019. The non-observational (theoretical)\nlanguage is called \u2018secondary system\u2019 (see also\n \u00a72).\n The paper is thoroughly instrumentalistic, since the factual content\nof theories consists only of their primary implications. This is made\nclear in a comment on the paper, written in August 1929 ([NP] 229,\nfootnote removed; see also Ramsey (1931, [FM] 260):\n\n\nThe essence of a theory is that we make our assertions in a form\ncontaining a lot of parameters, which have to be eliminated in order\nto get our real meaning.\n\nWe mean to assert everything that can be deduced and does not contain\na parameter.\n\n\nThe \u201cparameters\u201d here are the secondary terms. And Ramsey\n([NP] 236) stresses in a note on the infinite in mathematics that\ntheir use does not entail any ontological commitment:\n\nIt is obvious that mathematics does not require the existence of an\ninfinite number of things. We say at once that imaginary things will\ndo, i.e. theoretical secondary terms. But there are no imaginary\nthings, they are just words, and mathematicians and physicists who use\nthe infinite are just manipulating symbols with some analogy to\npropositions.\n\n\nTo investigate the relation of the primary and the secondary system,\nRamsey (1929a, [FM] 215\u201319) provides a primary system for an\nagent who, in discrete time intervals, can move forwards and\nbackwards, open and close their eyes, and see blue, red, or nothing.\nIn the secondary system, Ramsey formulates a toy theory that describes\nthe movement of the agent among three locations and the sometimes\nchanging color of the locations. A dictionary defines the primary\nterms in the secondary system so that, for instance, the agent sees\nblue if and only if situated at a blue location with open eyes.\n\nRamsey (1929a, [FM] 217\u201319) shows that all the theory\u2019s\nimplications in the primary system can be listed without the use of\nthe secondary system and, contrary to \u201cRussell, Whitehead, Nicod\nand Carnap\u201d (220), that it is virtually impossible to define the\nsecondary terms in the primary system:\n\n[T]here is neither in this case nor in general any simple way of\ninverting the dictionary so as to get either a unique or an obviously\npreeminent solution which will also satisfy the axioms, the reason for\nthis lying partly in difficulties of detail in the solution of the\nequations, partly in the fact that the secondary system has a higher\nmultiplicity, i.e. more degrees of freedom, than the primary. (222)\n\n\nCarnap (1923, 100) had already noted the additional degrees of freedom\nin the secondary system, but without appreciating the implication\n(obvious for Ramsey) regarding the inversion of the dictionary.\nRamsey\u2019s qualification that there is no simple\ninversion is needed to exclude the following case: Assume that all the\nmodels of the theory and the dictionary are finite and all objects\nhave names in the primary system. Then in each model \\(M_i\\), each\nterm \\(T_j\\) of the secondary system is co-extensional with a formula\n\\(\\phi_{i,j}\\) in the primary system. If furthermore each model is\nnamed by a sentential constant \\(C_i\\) of the primary system, one can\ndefine each term \\(T_jx_1\\ldots x_n\\) as the conjunction of the\nmaterial implications \\(C_i \\to \\phi_{i,j}(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) for all\nmodels \\(M_i\\) (220\u201321). However, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 230)\nargues, apart from being cumbersome, definitions for secondary terms\nactually hinder scientific development because they require conceptual\ndecisions based on fiat rather than further empirical discoveries (cf.\nBraithwaite 1953, 52\u201376). This criticism was later rediscovered\nby Carnap (1936, 449).\n\nTo avoid these problems, Ramsey (1929a, [FM] 231) suggests a way of\napplying a theory without defining the secondary terms:\n\nThe best way to write our theory seems to be this:\n\n\\((\\exists \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)\\): dictionary \\(\\cdot\\)\naxioms.\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are variables for the terms of\nthe secondary system and are interpreted purely extensionally, so that\nthe theory states \u201cThere are extensions \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\),\nand \\(\\gamma\\) that satisfy the sentences of the dictionary and the\naxioms\u201d. In contemporary presentations, the axioms are usually\ndenoted \\(T\\) (for \u2018theory\u2019), the dictionary is denoted\n\\(C\\) (for \u2018correspondence rules\u2019), and the secondary\nterms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are treated as parameters in \\(T\\) and\n\\(C\\), so that the conjunction of axioms and dictionary is written as\n\\(TC(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n)\\). What is now called the \u2018Ramsey\nsentence\u2019 \\({TC}^R\\) is then written as \n\\[ {TC}^R = \\exists X_1,\\ldots ,X_nTC(X_1,\\ldots ,X_n), \\]\n\n\nthat is, in the conjunction of all axioms and sentences of the\ndictionary, the theoretical terms \\(T_1,\\ldots ,T_n\\) are replaced by\nvariables \\(X_1,\\ldots ,X_n\\) and bound by existential quantifiers.\nThis procedure is now known as \u2018Ramseyfication\u2019 or\n\u2018Ramsification\u2019. If some of the theoretical terms are of\nthe highest order (predicates or functions of \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\)\norder in \\(n^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) order logic), then Ramseyfication\nincreases the order of the theory by one. While higher-order\nexistential quantification was commonly used to express consistency\nwhen Ramsey wrote \u201cTheories\u201d, he was the first to quantify\non only some of the terms (Demopoulos 2003, 256). Crucially, the\nRamsey sentence contains no theoretical terms while still entailing\nthe same primary statements as \\(TC\\) (for a simple proof, see Bohnert\n1967, 342\u201343). Since all of \\(TC\\)\u2019s sentences are in the\nscope of the existential quantifiers introduced during Ramseyfication,\n\\({TC}^R\\) does not assign meaning to individual secondary sentences\nor terms. However, we can still reason with them by deriving primary\npropositions from them within the scope of the quantifiers, just as we\ncan derive propositions from variable hypotheses (1929a, [FM] 232;\nBohnert 1967, 344\u201347). Hence secondary universal sentences are\n\u201cat two removes\u201d from propositions, and secondary\nsentences and terms are only meaningful in the context of the theory\nto which they belong (1931, 260).\n\nAs an example, consider a simplification of Ramsey\u2019s toy theory\nthat states that being at a blue location with open eyes is followed\nby being at a red location with open eyes: \\(\\forall x(Bx \\wedge Ox\n\\to Rx' \\wedge Ox')\\), where \\(x'\\) is the successor of \\(x\\).\n\u2018Blue\u2019 (\\(B\\)), \u2018red\u2019 (\\(R\\)), and \u2018open\neyes\u2019 (\\(O\\)) are theoretical terms. The correspondence rules\ndefine the observational terms \u2018perceiving blue\u2019 as\n\u2018being at a blue location with open eyes\u2019, \\(\\forall x(Px\n\\leftrightarrow Bx \\wedge Ox)\\), and correspondingly \u2018perceiving\nred\u2019 \\(\\forall x(Qx \\leftrightarrow Rx \\wedge Ox)\\). The Ramsey\nsentence of \\(TC\\) is then: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\exists X_1,X_2,X_3[& \\forall x(Px \\leftrightarrow X_1x \\wedge X_2x) \\;\\wedge \\\\\n & \\forall x(Qx \\leftrightarrow X_3x \\wedge X_2x) \\;\\wedge \\\\\n & \\forall x(X_1x \\wedge X_2x \\to X_3x' \\wedge X_2x')] \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis is equivalent to the observational sentence \\(\\forall x(Px \\to\nQx')\\), which states that perceiving blue is followed by perceiving\nred. For any specific location \\(a\\), this variable hypothetical then\nbecomes the proposition \\(Pa \\to Qa'\\).\n\nWhile sentences of any order can be Ramseyfied, many technical\ndiscussions (e.g., the overview by van Benthem 1978) treat the special\ncase in which axioms and dictionary are of first order and the Ramsey\nsentence is of second order. In this case, the class of models of the\nobservational first-order implications of \\(TC\\) can be a proper\nsuperset of the class of models of \\({TC}^R\\). This has been known at\nleast since 1941 as the difference between elementary and\npseudoelementary classes (Hodges 1993, 207, 260) and is regularly\nrediscovered in philosophy (see Demopoulos 2011, 179). It entails that\n\\({TC}^R\\) can be false in a structure even though all the first order\nimplications of \\(TC\\) are true. Specifically, \\(TC\\) may only have\ntautological observational implications even though the Ramsey\nsentence is not logically true; this situation is one version of the\ndistinction between syntactic and semantic conservativeness known from\ndefinition theory (Gupta 2015, \u00a72.3; Prze\u0142\u0119cki 1969,\n52\u201353).\n\nCarnap (1963, \u00a724.D) used the Ramsey sentence for distinguishing\nbetween the analytic and synthetic components of higher-order theories\n(Uebel 2016, \u00a73.5), and Lewis (1970) significantly modified the\nRamsey sentence to arrive at explicit definitions of secondary terms\n(Andreas 2017, \u00a74.4). This Ramsey-Lewis sentence has become\ncentral in the philosophy of mind (Levin 2017, \u00a74.1) and\nphilosophical methodology (Papineau 2016, \u00a72.3).\n\nIn current terminology, the semantics of the Ramsey sentence is the\nfollowing: \\({TC}^R\\) is true in a structure \\(S\\) for the primary\nterms if and only if it is possible to add interpretations for the\nsecondary terms to \\(S\\) such that \\(TC\\) is true (Prze\u0142\u0119cki\n1969, ch. 6; Andreas 2017, \u00a74.2). Sneed (1971, 106) modified the\nsemantics of the Ramsey sentence for the use in structuralism (Schmidt\n2014, \u00a72.2.1; Stegm\u00fcller 1976, 88\u201389). Maxwell (1970,\n186\u201388) identified the Ramsey sentence with its semantics to\nargue that the Ramsey sentence expresses structural realism (see also\nLadyman 2016, \u00a73.2). Dewar (2019) argues that this is\nmisguided.\n8. Contributions to Mathematics\n\nDespite being employed as a mathematician at Cambridge Ramsey only\npublished one paper (1930) firmly in that subject, though two ideas he\nintroduced in his more philosophical papers (1926a, 1929b), also led\neventually to new lines of mathematical research. Each of these three\ncontributions has proved seminal and they are now rightly associated\nwith his name.\n\nOf these three Ramsey is best known within philosophy for his somewhat\nsketchy description of what later became known as the Dutch Book\nargument or theorem, see Vineberg 2016. In his unpublished paper\n\u201cTruth and Probability\u201d (1926a), Ramsey proposed a set of\naxioms and assumptions, his Laws of Preference, which enable\na subject to correlate the value of options \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\)\nand the preference relation between them with real numbers under the\nstandard ordering. Using \\(\\alpha\\) etc. as Ramsey does to denote both\nthe option and its correlated real number allows a subject in turn to\nequate their degree of belief in a proposition \\(p\\) with the\nratio \n\\[\\bel(p)= \\frac{\\alpha- \\gamma}{\\beta - \\gamma}\\]\n\n\nwhen, as far as the subject is concerned, the option \n\\[ \\alpha \\text{ (for certain)} \\]\n\n\nand the option \n\\[ \\beta \\text{ if } p \\text{ is true, } \\gamma \\text{ if } p \\text{ is false} \\]\n\n\nare equally preferable.\n\nRamsey then asserted that for partial belief (i.e. not certain belief)\n\u201cThis amounts roughly to defining the degree of belief in \\(p\\)\nby the odds at which the subject would bet on \\(p\\), the bet being\nconducted in terms of differences of value as defined\u201d. In\nmaking this rough identification then Ramsey draws on the already\n\u201cold-established\u201d idea of measuring one\u2019s degree of\nbelief in a proposition \\(p\\) in terms of ones willingness to bet on\nits being true (1926a, [FM] 172). While he does not elaborate further\non this connection it is implicit in the derivations that follow that\nRamsey concludes that there is a number \\(x\\) such that for any option\n\\(\\xi\\) and any stake \\(t\\) (positive or negative), \\(\\xi\\) for\ncertain is equivalent to: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\xi + \\text{receive } (1-x)t, &\\text{ if } p \\text{ is true} \\\\\n \\xi + \\text{receive } -xt, &\\text{ if } p \\text{ is false} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nAs above this gives \\(\\bel(p)=x\\), from which we might surmise that\nRamsey intends \\(\\bel(p)\\) to be that number for which the\noptions: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{receive } (1-\\bel(p))t, &\\text{ if } p \\text{ is true} \\\\\n \\text{receive } {-}\\bel(p)t, &\\text{ if } p \\text{ is false} \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nare all equally acceptable to the subject. (There is an assumption\nhere that the stake \\(t\\) is not so great as to incur\n\u201cdiminishing marginal utility\u201d.)\n\nWith this definition of the function \\(\\bel(p)\\) and its further\nextension \\(\\bel(p\\mid q)\\) to conditional belief in \\(p\\) given\n\\(q\\), for which Ramsey claims credit, he argues that if a\nsubject\u2019s degrees of belief are consistent in the sense of\nobeying these Laws of Preference (alternatively, as Ramsey simply\nstates, do not allow a [Dutch] book to be made against him by which he\nwould lose in any event) then \\(Bel\\) must satisfy the\n\u201cfundamental laws of probable belief (degrees of belief between\n0 and 1)\u201d, which he gives as: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\bel(p) + \\bel(\\neg p) = 1, \\\\\n &\\bel(p\\mid q) + \\bel(\\neg p\\mid q) = 1, \\\\\n &\\bel(p \\wedge q) = \\bel(q\\mid p) \\cdot \\bel(p), \\\\\n &\\bel(p \\wedge q) + \\bel(p \\wedge \\neg q) = \\bel(p). \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nRamsey also states, again without proof, the converse (1926a, [FM],\n183):\n\n\nHaving degrees of belief obeying the laws of probability implies a\nfurther measure of consistency, namely such a consistency between the\nodds acceptable on different propositions as shall prevent a book\nbeing made against you.\n\n\nNowadays, this result is commonly attributed to John Kemeny (1955) and\nindependently Sherman Lehman (1955).\n\nSuch casual allusions to important new mathematical results without\nfurther explanation seems to have been a feature of Ramsey\u2019s\nwriting.\n\nUnaware of Ramsey\u2019s result, Bruno de Finetti published (1931) a\ndetailed direct proof that if a subject\u2019s (unconditional)\ndegrees of belief \\(\\bel(p)\\) do not allow such a book, he calls such\na subject coherent, then \\(\\bel\\) must satisfy what would\nlater become know as Kolmogorov\u2019s Axioms (1933) for a finitely\nadditive probability function and conversely. In consequence of this\nfuller explication the forward direction of the Dutch Book argument\nfor belief as probability is commonly attributed to de Finetti\nalone.\n\nIn recent times Dutch Book arguments have become an established topic\nin philosophy and mathematics in terms of analysing and extending the\noriginal argument to other logics, see Vineberg 2016.\n\nA second important mathematical contribution of Ramsey is based on the\nfollowing brief footnote in his otherwise philosophical paper\nGeneral Propositions and Causality (1929b, [FM] 247):\n\n\nIf two people are arguing \u2018If \\(p\\) will \\(q\\)?\u2019 and are\nboth in doubt as to \\(p\\), they are adding \\(p\\) hypothetically to\ntheir stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about \\(q\\); so\nthat in a sense \u2018If \\(p\\), \\(q\\)\u2019 and \u2018If \\(p\\), not\n\\(q\\)\u2018 are contradictories.\n\n\nStarting with Robert Stalnaker (1968) this has been (mis)interpreted\n(see the section on Conditionals) as a bridge between logics of\n(indicative) conditionals (Edgington 2014, Arlo-Costa 2016) and logics\nof belief revision (Hansson 2017). In the former the interest is in\nformalising the properties of conditional assertions such as\nif \\(p\\) then \\(q\\), denoted \\(p>q\\), their\nsemantics and the rules and constraints that, arguably, they should\nobey. For the latter the focus is on capturing the rules and\nconstraints that, again arguably, should apply when an agent\u2019s\nset of beliefs \\(K\\), is to be revised, to \\(K*p\\) say, on receipt of\nnew information \\(p\\) which, in particular, may not even be consistent\nwith the original \\(K\\).\n\nThe above footnote has been formalised within this notation as the so\ncalled Ramsey\u2019s Test:\n\nAn agent with belief set \\(K\\) should accept \\(p \\gt q\\) iff \\(q \\in\nK*p\\)\n\nThrough this recipe then any logic of conditionals generates a logic\nof belief revision, and conversely. In this way it can act as a\ntest of the appropriateness of a logic of conditionals by\nopening up the corresponding logic of belief revision to scrutiny, and\nagain conversely.\n\nNot surprisingly then Ramsey\u2019s Test, in this or in its many\namended forms, has been hugely influential in the formal development\nof the logics of conditionals and belief revision in recent years, in\nphilosophy and equally in artificial intelligence.\n\nDespite its important contribution however Ramsey\u2019s Test has in\ncertain guises fallen foul of so called Triviality Theorems,\nstarting with G\u00e4rdenfors (1986), which show that under certain\nconditions and apparently reasonable constraints on the belief\nrevision Ramsey\u2019s Test can only apply to a very limited family\nof belief sets \\(K\\). That is, agents who satisfied Ramsey\u2019s\nTest could only consistently subscribe to very limited and trivial\nbelief sets. In particular this can happen if we allow \\(>\\) to\nfreely appear in the logical language from which the sentences \\(p,q\\)\netc. are formed since then it would seem that the Ramsey Test would\nequally amount to:\n\nRamsey Test (RT):\n\nFor an agent with belief set \\(K\\), \\((p>q) \\in K\\) iff \\(q\\in K *\np\\)\n\nFrom this it follows that \\(*\\) must be monotonic in the sense that if\n\\(K \\subseteq K'\\) then \\(K*p \\subseteq K'*p\\), since if \\(q \\in K*p\\)\nthen \\((p>q) \\in K\\) by (RT) so \\(K \\subseteq K'\\) gives \\((p>q)\n\\in K'\\) and hence by (RT) again \\(q \\in K'*p\\). But this is a\nconclusion which goes against intuition, and unless the allowed belief\nsets \\(K\\) are severely limited, contradicts ostensibly reasonable\nassumptions about \\(*\\), including in particular that if \\(p\\) is\nconsistent with \\(K\\) then \\(K*p\\) should be simply the logical\nconsequences of \\(K \\cup\\{p\\}\\).\n\nRamsey\u2019s third contribution, and the one most directly important\nfor mathematics, consists of two closely related theorems proved in\nthe paper On a Problem of Formal Logic (1930) which was read\nto the London Mathematical Society on the 13th December 1928. This\nmaterial is uncompromisingly aimed at mathematicians and with\napologies its explication herein requires some necessary\ntechnicalities.\n\nThe first of these theorems says that if \\(n,r\\) are finite positive\nnumbers and \\(X\\) is an infinite set and we partition the set of\nsubsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts then there is an\ninfinite subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) such that every subset of \\(Y\\) of size\n\\(n\\) is in the same part. The second theorem gives a version of the\nfirst, but for finite sets of sufficiently large size. It says that,\nfor any finite positive numbers \\(m,n,r\\) there is a finite positive\n\\(k\\) such that if \\(X\\) has at least \\(k\\) elements, and we partition\nthe sets of subsets of \\(X\\) of size \\(n\\) into \\(r\\) parts, then\nthere is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) with at least \\(m\\) elements such\nthat every subset of \\(Y\\) of size \\(n\\) is in the same part of the\npartition. Ramsey gave an upper bound on such a \\(k\\) in terms of\n\\(m,n,r\\) but even today the actual value of the least such \\(k\\),\nknown as the Ramsey Number \\(R_n(m,r)\\), is unknown in all\nbut a handful of cases for small \\(n,m,r\\). These two results are now\nreferred to as the Infinite and Finite Ramsey Theorems, respectively.\nThey can be viewed as generalizing Dirichlet\u2019s much earlier\nSchubfachprinzip or Pigeon Hole Principle\n(1832).\n\nRamsey then uses the finite theorem in this paper to show that for\neach sentence, from a relational language with equality, of the\nform \n\\[\\exists z_1, \\ldots, z_m \\forall x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\, \\theta(z_1, \\ldots, z_m,x_1, \\ldots, x_n),\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is quantifier free, one could effectively decide if\nit was satisfiable in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\). Ramsey\nachieved this by showing that one can write down a natural number\n\\(k\\) such that for any cardinal \\(\\kappa \\geq k\\) this sentence can\nbe satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) just if it\ncan be satisfied in some structure of cardinality \\(k\\), and to\ndetermine this latter just requires checking its satisfiability in one\nof the finitely many such structures. An important innovation in his\nproof was the notion of indiscernibles which was to reappear,\napparently independently, three decades later in Model Theory. It was\nsubsequently employed in the proof of Michael Morley\u2019s seminal\nCategoricity Theorem (1965) and later in the proof of the\nParis-Harrington Theorem (Paris & Harrington 1977).\n\nThis result of Ramsey\u2019s improved on earlier joint work of Paul\nBernays and Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel (1928) and solves the prospective\nSpectrum Problem (Scholz 1952), for sentences of the above\nform, now referred to as the Bernays-Sch\u00f6nfinkel-Ramsey Class.\nThat is, for such sentences it enables us to determine the class of\ncardinalities of structures in which that sentence can be satisfied.\nAs a corollary it gives that one can effectively decide if a sentence\nin this class is satisfiable in some structure. However it\nseems clear from the accompanying discussion that Ramsey was aware\nthat there was also a direct and simple proof of this fact.\n\nThis corollary would seem to justify Ramsey\u2019s stated aim in this\npaper to provide a step towards a positive solution to Hilbert\u2019s\nEntscheidungsproblem though it is possible that the aim he\nactually had in mind was the related Spectrum Problem. Hilbert\u2019s\ngoal was later shown to be not achievable by the undecidability\nresults of Alonzo Church (1936) and independently Alan Turing (1937).\nIn fact Ramsey\u2019s positive contribution turned out to be the best\npossible in the sense that decidability fails once the order of the\nblocks of existential and universal quantifiers is reversed, see\nKalm\u00e1r & Sur\u00e1nyi 1950, and Mortimer 1975.\n\nRamsey\u2019s Theorems were later popularised in an influential paper\nof Paul Erd\u0151s and George Szekeres (1935) and initiated in the\nearly 1970s the establishment of Ramsey Theory as a major\nsubdiscipline of Combinatorics. The basic aim in this subdiscipline is\nto show that mathematical structures of a certain type and size (and\ngenerally non-uniform) must have within them uniform substructures of\na certain type and size, see Katz & Reimann 2018,\nNe\u0161et\u0159il & R\u00f6dl 1990, and Spencer & Graham\n1990.\n\nRamsey\u2019s Theorems themselves have yielded numerous important\napplications, generalizations and concepts in other branches of\nmathematics. For example the notion of a Ramsey Cardinal,\n\\(\\kappa\\), where we require that for a set \\(X\\) of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\) and any partition of the finite subsets of \\(\\kappa\\) into\ntwo sets there is a subset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\), also of cardinality\n\\(\\kappa\\), such that any two finite subsets of \\(Y\\) of the same size\nare in the same part of the partition. Ramsey Cardinals were one of\nthe first examples of large cardinals, a central area of\nresearch in Set Theory. One feature of such cardinals is that they are\nso large that their existence cannot be proved within ZFC.\n\nIn addition to these contributions to mathematics Frank Ramsey (1925a)\ndevoted much effort to addressing what were by then seen as problems\nin Whitehead & Russell\u2019s attempt in their Principia\nMathematica (1910\u20131913), to base mathematics on formal\nlogic, an enterprise which Ramsey initially strongly supported though\nhe ultimately became disappointed with his efforts to correct its\nshortcomings, see Paul 2012 (232). Since then this approach to the\nfoundations of mathematics has been very largely overshadowed amongst\nmathematicians by the practically simpler device of assuming as a\nfoundation Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory.",
