The two truths\nare not only the primary means by which M\u0101dhyamika philosophers\npresent their positions on ontology, but form the ground upon which\nissues of epistemology and logic are often discussed as well. The\nneither-one-nor-many argument is most succinctly presented in the\nfirst stanza of MA when he writes:\n\nThese entities, as asserted by our own [Buddhist schools] and other\n[non-Buddhist schools], have no inherent nature at all because in\nreality they have neither a singular nor manifold nature, like a\nreflection\n (pratibimbavat).[6]\n\n\nThe point that \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is attempting to make here\nis that no phenomena, including those which his philosophical rivals\nhave claimed to have an inherently existent essence or nature, in fact\ndo have such a nature. The reason they cannot have such a nature,\naccording to the argument, is that they have neither a truly singular\nnature (ekasvabh\u0101va), nor a truly manifold nature\n(anekasvabh\u0101va), the two being exhaustive of all\npossibilities for entities that have a real nature.\n\nOver the course of the next sixty stanzas in his ninety-seven stanza\ntext, MA, and accompanying auto-commentary, MAV,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita puts all those phenomena asserted by his\nBuddhist and non-Buddhist philosophical opponents to the test of the\nneither-one-nor-many reasoning. He begins by examining each instance\nin which some phenomena is asserted to be of a truly singular nature.\nThrough an analysis that reveals that such phenomena must have parts\nand thus could not be truly singular, he makes his way through all\nsuch cases current in late eighth century Indian philosophical\ndiscourse. For example, he begins his application of the argument with\nan analysis of the claim made by the non-Buddhist S\u0101\u1e43khya\nschool that there is a Fundamental Nature (Prak\u1e5bti) or\ncreator god which is the permanent, uncaused, unobstructed absolute\ncause of all phenomena and which is of a truly singular nature. He\nargues in the second stanza of MA:\n\nPermanent, efficacious entities are not themselves singular because\nthey contribute to the production of successive effects. If each\nsuccessive effect is distinct, then [the argument in favor of]\npermanent efficacious entities [that are truly singular]\n degenerates.[7]\n\n\nAccording to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, true singularity would be\nan absurd quality to claim for something which is permanent and has\nthe ability to contribute to the periodic production of successive\neffects. If that were the case, there must be a part of the causal\nentity in moment #1 which contributes to the production of a seed, for\nexample, a part in moment #2 which contributes to the production of\nthe sprout, and a part in moment #3 which contributes to the\nproduction of a flower. Since the Fundamental Nature is described as\nthe sole cause of the periodic arising of all effects, it must have\nall these parts, and more. It must have parts related with every\nentity for which it is a cause. The Fundamental Nature must include\nparts that cause entities to exist in one moment and parts that cause\nthem to cease to exist or transform into something else in another.\nThat which causes a seed to exist in moment #1 must have at least some\nquality or qualities that distinguish it from that which causes a\nsprout to exist in moment #2. At a bare minimum, his opponent must be\nforced to admit parts to such a Fundamental Nature. Something with\nmanifold parts cannot, by definition, be truly singular.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita thus considers that the application of\nthis sort of reasoning undermines the existence of such a truly\nsingular Fundamental Nature, as described in the S\u0101\u1e43khya\nsystem since it is illogical for there to be a permanent, truly\nsingular, unobstructed cause of the successive effects of the manifold\nworld. Arguments regarding the irrationality of asserting its\npermanence and those regarding its contradictions with our experience\nof causality in the world, are supplied in his own MAV on the above\nverse to strengthen his rejection of the notion of such a Fundamental\nNature.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita is not only critical of his non-Buddhist\nphilosophical opponents however. The bulk of the argument is addressed\ntoward the views of philosophical opponents within in his own larger\nBuddhist camp that he feels have made errors in interpretation and\nlogic. For example, he dedicates a lengthy portion of the\nneither-one-nor-many argument to criticisms of a variety of Buddhist\nclaims about the true singularity of consciousness made by both\nBuddhists associated with the Sautr\u0101ntika schools and those\nassociated with the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra/Cittam\u0101tra schools. In a\nvariety of ways, proponents of these schools claim that consciousness\nis truly singular and yet can be a knower of a multiplicity of\nobjects. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, such claims are fraught\nwith errors in logic. If consciousness knows a multiplicity of\nobjects, then it must not be singular by definition. There must be a\npart of the consciousness that knows object A and another than knows\nobject B. Various Buddhists who want to hold consciousness to be truly\nsingular, have attempted to avoid these faults in a variety of ways.\nSome have attempted to claim they avoid the faults because they assert\nthat there are an equal number of consciousnesses as objects. Others\nclaim that they avoid these problems because they claim consciousness\nexists in a non-dual relationship with its objects. Each of these\ninterpretive turns was met by \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita with\nlogical analysis demonstrating what he considered to be the inevitable\ncontradictions that ensue by the various attempts at claiming that\nconsciousness is truly singular. In this manner,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita analyzes a host of current claims of true\nsingularity over the course of the first sixty stanzas of the MA.\n\nHaving examined all those phenomena which his philosophical opponents\nclaim have or are of a truly singular nature and\ndetermined through reasoned analysis that they in fact, could not\npossibly have or be of a truly singular nature,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita proceeds to consider the possibility of\nthere being a truly manifold nature in phenomena. Because a manifold\nnature would depend upon the aggregation of true singularities, he\nconcludes that just as there can be no inherently singular nature,\nthere also can be no inherently manifold nature. And since there is no\nthird alternative for entities with an inherent nature, there must be\nno phenomena that have an inherently existent nature at all. While\nelaborated upon in greater detail in his auto-commentary, MAV, his\nterse summary of the neither-one-nor many argument is found in the\nsixty-first and sixty-second stanzas of MA as follows:\n\nWe have found with analysis that no entity, whatsoever, has an\n[inherently] single nature. Those that have no single nature must also\nnot have a manifold nature (vs. 61). The existence of an entity\nbelonging to a class other than that which has a single or manifold\n[nature] does not make sense because the two are exhaustive of all\npossible alternatives (vs.\n 62).[8]\n\n\nThus, an object\u2019s lack of, or emptiness of having an inherently\nexistent nature is an ultimate truth for \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita.\nHe considers that this position has been logically established by way\nof the neither-one-nor-many argument.\n",
