    "main_text": "\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) was a German philosopher of the\nlate 19th century who challenged the foundations of Christianity and\ntraditional morality. He was interested in the enhancement of\nindividual and cultural health, and believed in life, creativity,\npower, and down-to-earth realities, rather than those situated in a\nworld beyond. Central to his philosophy is the idea of\n\u201clife-affirmation,\u201d which involves an honest questioning\nof all doctrines that drain life\u2019s expansive energies, however\nsocially prevalent and morally entrenched those views might be. Often\nreferred to as one of the first existentialist philosophers along with\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u20131855), Nietzsche\u2019s\nrevitalizing philosophy has inspired leading figures in all walks of\ncultural life, including dancers, poets, novelists, painters,\npsychologists, philosophers, sociologists and social\nrevolutionaries.\n",
