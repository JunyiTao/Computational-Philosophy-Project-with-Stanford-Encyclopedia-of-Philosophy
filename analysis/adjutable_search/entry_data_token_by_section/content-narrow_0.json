Mental content simply means\nthe content of a mental state such as a thought, a belief, a desire, a\nfear, an intention, or a wish. Content is a deliberately\nvague term; it is a rough synonym of another vague term,\n\u2018meaning\u2019. A state with content is a state that\nrepresents some part or aspect of the world; its content is\nthe way it represents the world as being. For example, consider my\nbelief that water is a liquid at room temperature. The content of this\nbelief is what it says about the world, namely that a certain\nsubstance, water, has a certain property, being a liquid, under\nspecified conditions, namely being at room temperature. Whether a\nbelief is true or false depends on its content: it is true if the\nworld really is the way the belief represents it as being; otherwise\nit is false.\n\nA narrow content of a particular state is a content of that\nstate that is completely determined by the individual\u2019s\nintrinsic properties. An intrinsic property of an individual\nis a property that does not depend at all on the individual\u2019s\nenvironment. For example, having a certain shape is, arguably, an\nintrinsic property of a particular penny; being in my pocket is not an\nintrinsic property of the penny. This is because the penny\u2019s\nshape depends only on internal properties of the penny, whereas the\nfact that it is in my pocket depends on where it happens to be, which\nis an extrinsic property. The shape of the penny could not be\ndifferent unless the penny itself were different in some way, but the\npenny could be exactly the way it is even if it were not in my pocket.\nAgain, there could not be an exact duplicate of the penny that did not\nshare its shape, but there could be an exact duplicate that was not in\nmy pocket. Similarly, a narrow content of a belief or other mental\nstate is a content that could not be different unless the subject who\nhas the state were different in some intrinsic respect: no matter how\ndifferent the individual\u2019s environment were, the belief would\nhave the same content it actually does. Again, a narrow content of an\nindividual\u2019s belief is a content that must be shared by any\nexact duplicate of the individual. (If some form of dualism is true,\nthen the intrinsic properties of an individual may include properties\nthat are not completely determined by the individual\u2019s physical\nproperties. In that case an \u201cexact duplicate\u201d must be\nunderstood to be an individual who shares all intrinsic nonphysical\nproperties as well as physical ones.)\n\n(The notion of an intrinsic property turns out to be surprisingly\ndifficult to define precisely. A good guide to the various approaches\nthat have been taken, and their difficulties and refinements, is the\nentry on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties.)\n\nOn first encounter, it may seem strange that the idea of narrow\ncontent should be controversial, or even that we should need a special\nterm for it. Most people, if they were ever to explicitly consider the\nissue of whether mental content is narrow or broad, would probably\nhold that all mental content is narrow, i.e. that all of the contents\nof our mental states are entirely determined by our intrinsic\nproperties. It seems conceivable, for example, as Descartes argued in\nhis First Meditation, that our perceptual states and beliefs could be\nexactly as they are even if the world were nothing like we think it\nis. This seems to presuppose that no difference in our environment,\nhowever radical, could make a difference to the contents of our\nbeliefs so long as our intrinsic properties remained the same.\n\nWhy, then, have philosophers believed they need to define narrow\ncontent and argue for its existence? The reason is that many\nphilosophers have been convinced by some influential arguments that,\nin the most ordinary or typical sense of \u2018content\u2019, most\nor even all of the contents of our mental states are broad rather than\nnarrow. If this conclusion is correct, if ordinary content is broad,\nthen it requires some work to define an alternative, narrow conception\nof content, and it requires arguments to show that there is any such\nthing. To understand the issues about narrow content, then, it is\nessential to first understand the arguments that most ordinary content\nis broad.\n",
