    "main_text": "Voting Paradoxes || Variable Population Paradoxes\n3.3 Variable Population Paradoxes\n\nIn this section, I discuss two related paradoxes that involve changes\nto the population of voters. \n\nNo-Show Paradox: One way that a candidate may receive\n\u201cmore support\u201d is to have more voters show up to an\nelection that support them. Voting methods that do not satisfy this\nversion of monotonicity are said to be susceptible to the no-show\nparadox (Fishburn and Brams 1983). Suppose that there are 3\ncandidates and 11 voters with the following rankings: \n\n\n\n# VotersRanking\n4\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n3\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n1\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n3\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\nCandidate \\(C\\) is the Plurality with Runoff winner\n\n\n\nIn the first round, candidates \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are both ranked first\nby 4 voters while \\(B\\) is ranked first by only 3 voters. So, \\(A\\)\nand \\(C\\) move to the runoff round. In this round, the voters in the\nsecond column transfer their votes to candidate \\(C\\), so candidate\n\\(C\\) is the winner beating \\(A\\) 7-4. Suppose that 2 voters in the\nfirst group do not show up to the election: \n\n\n# VotersRanking\n\\(\\mathbf{2}\\)\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n3\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n1\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n3\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\nCandidate \\(B\\) is the Plurality with Runoff winner\n\n\n\nIn this election, candidate \\(A\\) has the lowest plurality score in\nthe first round, so candidates \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) move to the runoff\nround. The first group\u2019s votes are transferred to \\(B\\), so \\(B\\) is\nthe winner beating \\(C\\) 5-4. Since the 2 voters that did not show up\nto this election rank \\(B\\) above \\(C\\), they prefer the outcome of\nthe second election in which they did not participate! \n\nPlurality with Runoff is not the only voting method that is\nsusceptible to the no-show paradox. The Coombs Rule, Hare Rule and\nMajority Judgement (using the tie-breaking mechanism from Balinski and Laraki 2010)\nare all susceptible to the no-show paradox. It turns out that always\nelecting a Condorcet winner, if one exists, makes a voting method\nsusceptible to the above failure of monotonicity.\n\nTheorem (Moulin 1988).\n\nIf there are four or more candidates, then every Condorcet consistent\nvoting method is susceptible to the no-show paradox.\n\n\nSee Perez 2001, Campbell and Kelly 2002, Jimeno et al.\n2009, Duddy 2014, Brandt et al. 2017, 2019, and Nunez and Sanver 2017\nfor further discussions and generalizations of this result. \n\nMultiple Districts Paradox: Suppose that a population is\ndivided into districts. If a candidate wins each of the districts, one\nwould expect that candidate to win the election over the entire\npopulation of voters (assuming that the two districts divide the set of voters \ninto disjoint sets). This is certainly true for Plurality Rule: If a\ncandidate is ranked first by  the most  voters in  each of\nthe districts, then that candidate will also be ranked first by a\nthe most voters over the entire population. Interestingly, this is\nnot true for all voting methods (Fishburn and Brams 1983). The example\nbelow illustrates the paradox for Coombs Rule. \n\n# VotersRanking\nDistrict 13\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n3\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n3\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n1\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\nDistrict 22\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n3\\(B\\s A\\s C\\)\nDistrict 1: Candidate \\(B\\) is the Coombs winner\nDistrict 2: Candidate \\(B\\) is the Coombs winner\n\n\n\nCandidate \\(B\\) wins both districts: \n\n\nDistrict 1: There are a total of 10 voters in this district.\nNone of the candidates are ranked first by 6 or more voters, so\ncandidate \\(A\\), who is ranked last by 4 voters (compared to 3 voters\nranking each of \\(C\\) and \\(B\\) last), is eliminated.\nIn the second round, candidate \\(B\\) wins the election since 6 voters rank \\(B\\) above \\(C\\) and 4 voters rank \\(C\\) above \\(B\\). \n\n\nDistrict 2: There are a total of 5 voters in this district.\nCandidate \\(B\\) is ranked first by a strict majority of voters, so\n\\(B\\) wins the election. \n\n\nCombining the two districts gives the following table:\n\n# VotersRanking\nDistricts 1 + 2\u00a05\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n3\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n3\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\n1\\(C\\s B\\s A\\)\n3\\(B\\s A\\s C\\)\n Candidate \\(A\\) is the Coombs winner\n\n\n\nThere are 15 total voters in the combined districts. None of the\ncandidates are ranked first by 8 or more of the voters. Candidate\n\\(C\\) receives the most last-place votes, so is eliminated in the\nfirst round. In the second round, candidate \\(A\\) is beats candidate\n\\(B\\) by 1 vote (8 voters rank \\(A\\) above \\(B\\) and 7 voters rank\n\\(B\\) above \\(A\\)), and so is declared the winner. Thus, even though\n\\(B\\) wins both districts, candidate \\(A\\) wins the election when the\ndistricts are combined. \n\nThe other voting methods that are susceptible to the\nmultiple-districts paradox include Plurality with Runoff, The Hare\nRule, and Majority Judgement. Note that these methods are also\nsusceptible to the no-show paradox. As is the case with the no-show\nparadox, every Condorcet consistent voting method is susceptible to\nthe multiple districts paradox (see Zwicker, 2016, Proposition 2.5). I\nsketch the proof of this from Zwicker 2016 (pg. 40) since it adds to\nthe discussion at the end of Section 3.1 about whether the Condorcet\nwinner should be elected. \n\nSuppose that \\(V\\) is a voting method that always selects the\nCondorcet winner (if one exists) and that \\(V\\) is not susceptible to\nthe multiple-districts paradox. This means that if a candidate \\(X\\)\nis among the winners according to \\(V\\) in each of two districts, then\n\\(X\\) must be among the winners according to \\(V\\) in the combined\ndistricts. Consider the following two districts.\n\n# VotersRanking\nDistrict 12\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n2\\(B\\s C\\s A\\)\n2\\(C\\s A\\s B\\)\nDistrict 21\\(A\\s B\\s C\\)\n\n2\\(B\\s A\\s C\\)\n\n\n\nNote that in district 2 candidate \\(B\\) is the Condorcet winner, so\nmust be the only winner according to \\(V\\). In district 1, there are\nno Condorcet winners. If candidate \\(B\\) is among the winners\naccording to \\(V\\), then, in order to not be susceptible to the\nmultiple districts paradox, \\(B\\) must be among the winners in the\ncombined districts. In fact, since \\(B\\) is the only winner in\ndistrict 2, \\(B\\) must be the only winner in the combined districts.\nHowever, in the combined districts, candidate \\(A\\) is the Condorcet\nwinner, so must be the (unique) winner according to \\(V\\). This is a\ncontradiction, so \\(B\\) cannot be among the winners according to \\(V\\)\nin district 1. A similar argument shows that neither \\(A\\) nor \\(C\\)\ncan be among the winners according to \\(V\\) in district 1 by swapping\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in the first case and \\(B\\) with \\(C\\) in the second\ncase in the rankings of the voters in district 2. Since \\(V\\) must\nassign at least one winner to every profile, this is a contradiction;\nand so, \\(V\\) is susceptible to the multiple districts paradox. \n\nOne last comment about this paradox: It is an example of a more\ngeneral phenomenon known as Simpson\u2019s Paradox (Malinas and Bigelow\n2009). See Saari (2001, Section 4.2) for a discussion of Simpson\u2019s\nParadox in the context of voting theory. \n",
