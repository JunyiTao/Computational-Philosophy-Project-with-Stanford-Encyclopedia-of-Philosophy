    "main_text": "\n\nThe theory of properties of terms (proprietates terminorum)\nwas the basis of the medievals\u2019 semantic theory. It embraced\nthose properties of linguistic expressions necessary to explain truth,\nfallacy and inference, the three central concepts of logical analysis.\nThe theory evolved out of the work of Anselm and Abelard at the turn\nof the twelfth century, developed steadily through the thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries and was still undergoing changes in the fifteenth\nand sixteenth centuries. It is generally agreed that its early stages\nwere closely bound up with the theory of fallacies, but as a general\nsemantic theory, it developed in response to a variety of needs, and\none mistake of modern attempts at interpretation is to seek a unique\nrationale of one notion or another. Each notion evolved continually,\nsatisfying one need at one time and another at a later date, and often\nseveral conflicting needs at the same time. Another mistake is to try\nto map each notion seriatim onto corresponding notions in\ncontemporary semantic theory, but although one can see analogies and\nsimilarities, none of the medieval \u201cproperties\u201d matches\nexactly any modern notion.\n",
