    "main_text": "Common Interests (i): Joint Activity\n5. Common Interests (i): Joint Activity\n\nLet\u2019s turn now to some of the ways that conceptions of the\ncommon good differ from each other. One way has to do with how they\ndefine the privileged class of common interests that are the object of\nthe political relationship. We can divide the important views in the\nliterature into two main categories: (a) joint activity\nconceptions and (b) private individuality conceptions.\n\n\nA joint activity\nconception defines the privileged class of common interests as\ninterests that members have in taking part in a complex activity that\ninvolves all or most members of the community. Among those who endorse\nthis kind of view are ancient philosophers, such as Plato\n(Republic) and Aristotle (Politics), secular natural\nlaw theorists such as John Finnis (1980), and most natural law\ntheorists in the Catholic tradition. Aspects of the joint activity\nview are also important in the work of communitarian thinkers such as\nCharles Taylor (1984) and, to a lesser extent, Michael Sandel (2009).\nThe most important and influential view is Aristotle\u2019s.\n\nAristotle holds that members of a political community are not just\ninvolved in a military alliance or an especially dense network of\ncontractual agreements (Pol. 1280b29\u201333). Members are\nalso involved in a relationship that he describes as a form of\nfriendship (NE 1159b25\u201335). This friendship consists in\ncitizens wishing one another well, their being aware of the fact that\ntheir fellow citizens wish them well, and their taking part in a\nshared life that answers to this mutual concern (Pol.\n1280b29\u20131281a3). In caring about one another and wishing one\nanother well, what citizens care about in particular is that they and\ntheir fellow citizens live well, that is, live the most choiceworthy\nlife.[13]\n\nThe most choiceworthy life, on Aristotle\u2019s view, is a pattern of\nactivity that fully engages and expresses the rational parts of human\nnature. This pattern of activity is a pattern of joint\nactivity because, like a play, it has various interdependent\nparts that can only be realized by the members of a group together.\nThe pattern is centered on an array of leisured activities that are\nvaluable in themselves, including philosophy, mathematics, art and\nmusic. But the pattern also includes the activity of coordinating the\nsocial effort to engage in leisured activities (i.e., statesmanship)\nand various supporting activities, such as the education of citizens\nand the management of resources.\n\nOn Aristotle\u2019s view, a properly ordered society will have an\narray of material, cultural and institutional facilities that answer\nto the common interest of citizens in living the most choiceworthy\nlife. These facilities form an environment in which citizens can\nengage in leisured activities and in which they can perform the\nvarious coordinating and supporting activities. Some facilities that\nfigure into Aristotle\u2019s account include: common mess halls and\ncommunal meals, which provide occasions for leisured activities\n(Pol. 1330a1\u201310; 1331a19\u201325); a communal system\nof education (Pol. 1337a20\u201330); common land\n(Pol. 1330a9\u201314); commonly owned slaves to work the\nland (Pol. 1330a30\u20133); a shared set of political\noffices (Pol. 1276a40\u20133; 1321b12\u2013a10) and\nadministrative buildings (Pol. 1331b5\u201311); shared\nweapons and fortifications (Pol. 1328b6\u201311;\n1331a9\u201318); and an official system priests, temples and public\nsacrifices (Pol. 1322b17\u201328).\n\nAristotle\u2019s account may seem distant from modern sensibilities,\nbut a good analogy for what he has in mind is the form of community\nthat we associate today with certain universities. Think of a college\nlike Princeton or Harvard. Members of the university community are\nbound together in a social relationship marked by a certain form of\nmutual concern: members care that they and their fellow members live\nwell, where living well is understood in terms of taking part in a\nflourishing university life. This way of life is organized around\nintellectual, cultural and athletic activities, such as physics, art\nhistory, lacrosse, and so on. Members work together to maintain an\narray of facilities that serve their common interest in taking part in\nthis joint activity (e.g., libraries, computer labs, dorm rooms,\nfootball fields, etc.). And we can think of public life in the\nuniversity community in terms of a form of shared practical reasoning\nthat most members engage in, which focuses on maintaining common\nfacilities for the sake of their common\ninterest.[14]\n",
