    "main_text": "Porphyry\u2019s Classification of Singular Terms\n2. Porphyry\u2019s Classification of Singular Terms\n\n\nDiscussions of singular terms were frequently related to a passage\nfrom Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge. In the version used by medieval\nlogicians, Porphyry writes: \u201cIndividual is said of one\nparticular alone. Socrates is said to be individual, and this white\n<thing>, and this approaching <person>, and son of\nSophroniscus, if Socrates be his only son. Such things are said to be\nindividuals, since each of them consists of properties whose\ncollection will never be the same in another.\u201d \n\n\nThe last sentence of Porphyry\u2019s text ties the ontological notion of an\nindividual to a collection of properties, and as a corollary, it can\nbe taken to tie the notion of an individual term to a descriptive\nphrase. However, there was fairly general agreement that a collection\nof properties could not constitute an individual, and there seems to\nhave been no attempt to make the description of these properties into\na definition of the individual, or to see them as providing the\nprimary signification of singular terms. In the twelfth century,\nAbelard pointed out at some length in his Dialectica that\nSocrates is the name of an individual substance and that the accidents\nassociated with him by some description cannot enter into the\nimposition of the signification of the name, else the name would be\nequivocal through time. Socrates was called Socrates before he became\na poet (or musician) and after he ceased to be the son of Sophroniscus\n(presumably by the latter\u2019s death).  The notion that one could define\nan individual by giving a list of common properties was also ruled out\nby Priscian\u2019s account of names (see \u00a74), and the resulting\ndistinction between primary and secondary signification.\n\n\nThe main part of Porphyry\u2019s text offered medieval logicians the basis\nfor a classification of three types of singular term. First, there is\nthe determinate individual, represented by the proper name\n\u2018Socrates\u2019. Everyone realized that different people could\nhave the same name, but it is important to note that\n\u2018Socrates\u2019 said of two different people was a standard\nexample of an equivocal term, a word with two unrelated significations\n(see \u00a75). For each individual named \u2018Socrates\u2019, there\nhad to be a specific semantic convention associating that individual\nwith that name-type. John Buridan remarked that even if there were a\nthousand other people called John, all entirely similar to him, the\nname \u2018John\u2019 as bestowed on Buridan would signify only\nBuridan and no one else. \n\n\nThe second type of singular term is the vague individual\n(individuum vagum), represented by the phrases \u2018this\nwhite <thing>\u2019 and \u2018this approaching\n<person>\u2019. In other contexts, especially commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s Categories 2a11\u201313, the vague individual was\nrepresented by such phrases as \u2018some man\u2019, but in all the\ntexts we are concerned with, the presence of the demonstrative pronoun\nis crucial. The word \u2018vague\u2019 is used partly because the\nsame phrase will have a different reference when uttered in different\ncontexts, but mainly because the identification of the individual in\nquestion is indeterminate, though to a varying extent. \u2018This\nbeing\u2019 and \u2018this body\u2019 are highly indeterminate,\n\u2018this animal\u2019 is less indeterminate, and \u2018this\nman\u2019 is even less indeterminate, but it still lacks the\nprecision of \u2018Socrates\u2019. I can recognize someone as a man\nwithout being able to distinguish him from other men in any reliable\nmanner. As we shall see below (\u00a79), Buridan took the vague\nsingular to be the most proper type of singular term.\n\n\nFinally, we have the individual by supposition (ex\nsuppositione) or by circumlocution (circumlocutione),\nrepresented by the phrase \u2018son of Sophroniscus\u2019 . Some\npeople distinguished two cases here. For John Versor, a\nfifteenth-century thinker, \u2018son of Sophroniscus\u2019 is\ndeterminate by virtue of supposition, but \u2018man with a fat head,\na long nose and so on\u2019 is determinate by virtue of\ncircumlocution. In works which did not comment on Porphyry directly,\nthe third type was often omitted, and there was agreement that\nalthough the phrases involved are referring expressions and may in\nfact refer to just one thing, they are not properly speaking singular\nterms. Just as some common terms, such as \u2018sun\u2019 and\n\u2018moon\u2019, in fact have only one referent, so there are\nreferring phrases which in fact have only one referent, but do not\ncount as singular terms because by the mode of their signification\nthey could supposit for more than one thing. \n\n\nWe should note that in the context of Porphyry\u2019s discussion, we are\ndealing with indefinite descriptions, given that the stipulation that\nSophroniscus has only one son is not part of the phrase but merely\nbackground information.  This fact is enough to ensure that the phrase\nin fact refers to only one individual, but it does not alter the\nlinguistic generality of the phrase.  There was little specific\ndiscussion of definite descriptions, but it seems that they would have\nbeen treated in the same way. John Buridan has the most direct\ndiscussion of the issue. In one place he considers the phrase,\n\u2018first Christian king of France\u2019 (primus rex Francie\nchristianus).  This he took to be general, insofar as it is made\nup of common concepts.  In another place he considers the phrase\n\u2018largest and brightest heavenly body\u2019 (planeta maximus\net lucidissimus) used to refer to the sun, and he remarks that the\nvery same phrase, without any new imposition, could supposit for a\nsecond sun if God were to create another, either similar or greater in\nsize and brightness.  He could be interpreted as saying that the very\nsame phrase, without being given any new signification, could refer to\ndifferent individuals in different possible worlds.\n",
