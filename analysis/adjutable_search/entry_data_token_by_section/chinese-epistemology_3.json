    "main_text": "Specific Features || Relational Epistemology\n2.1 Relational Epistemology\n\nThe naturalistic epistemologies that prevailed in Western discourses\nwere dealing with the external world (or objective reality), which was\nto a great extent independent from the subject of comprehension.\nChinese approaches to knowledge can be called relational\nepistemologies, because they refer to relations. This applies not only\nto radical holistic epistemologies, which denied the notion of\nsubstance, but also to a number of contemporary theories which\nadvocate a strict division between the subject and object of\ncomprehension (see Xia 2000: 4)\n\nChinese relational epistemology was based upon viewing the world as a\ncomplex structure composed of relations, intersections and interacting\nfeedback loops. Specific Chinese models for investigating questions\nrelated to knowledge were thus premised upon a structurally ordered\nexternal reality; since natural (or cosmic) order is organic, it\nnaturally follows the \u201cflow\u201d of structural patterns and\noperates in accordance with structural principles that regulate every\nexistence and are manifested in the concept of li \u7406.\nIn this worldview, the human mind is also structured in accordance\nwith this all-embracing but open organic system. The axioms of our\nrecognition and thought are therefore not coincidental or arbitrary,\nbut follow this dynamic structure. In this view, the compatibility or\ncorrespondence of both the cosmic and mental structures is the basic\nprecondition that enables human beings to perceive and recognize\nexternal reality (Ro\u0161ker 2010: 79\u201382).\n\nIn most traditional discourses (with the exception of the Mohist\nschool, The School of Names and certain representatives of the\nNeo-Confucianism), the focus upon relations was linked to the unity of\nthe subject and object of comprehension. If we posit that the relation\nrepresents the object of comprehension, we must also specify that this\nobject is not automatically to be seen as a counter-pole to the\nsubject of comprehension. Relational epistemologies are not based upon\na strict division between these entities, nor upon a strict (or\nnecessary) demarcation of what, with respect to the subject of\ncomprehension, we are accustomed to see as the external or internal\nworld. Therefore, the methods used by certain philosophers in various\ncurrents of the Chinese tradition, are by no means decisive for\ndefining the positions of the subject and the object of comprehension,\nor the nature of their mutual relations. The methods for exploring\n(external) reality (gewu \u683c\u7269) and in\u00adtro\u00adspec\u00adtive\nrecognition (fanxing \u53cd\u7701) were both important as\nperceptive tools that primarily served to understand relations.\nHowever, these relations can be either continuous or discontinuous.\nThis means that the relation between A and B can be\nchanged into a relation between A and C. In Chinese\nepistemologies, such de-composition and changing of positions is in\nthe nature of comprehension (Zhang 2002: 78). In this context,\nknowledge (zhi) was primarily understood as recognition\n(shi \u8b58) of the structural principles (li) of\nthe all-embracing Way (dao), which, among all other entities\nof being, was also expressed in linguistic terms.\n\nThe relation as a basis or a central object and goal of any\nrecognition manifests itself on all levels of comprehension and\ntransmission of being. Hence, the relational aspect as a core of\ncomprehension was already apparent in the specific structure of\nChinese cosmology, which was based upon the holistic unity of humanity\nand nature (tian ren heyi). The complexity and integrity of\nrelations in nature and society therefore represent a basic aspect of\nChinese epistemology. This aspect was expressed in all classical\ndebates, which were based upon the elementary traditional\nepistemological categories of name (ming) and actualities\n(shi). Relations also formed the basic postulate of\ntraditional thought which defined the nature of the central\nepistemological relation between knowledge (zhi) and action\n(xing). Primarily due to the impact of the Buddhist thought,\nthe ancient holistic approach to perception and understanding reality\nthrough substance (ti \u9ad4) and functions (yong\n\u7528) was later replaced by the subject (neng \u80fd)\nand object (suo \u6240) of com\u00adpre\u00adhen\u00adsion. This kind of\ncategorical demarcation that derived from the Indian tradition of\nthought would subsequently, in the 19th and especially the\n20th centuries, help Chinese philosophers gain a better\nunderstanding of theories of knowledge in western philosophy, which\nwere based on the ontology of dividing substance from phenomena.\n",
