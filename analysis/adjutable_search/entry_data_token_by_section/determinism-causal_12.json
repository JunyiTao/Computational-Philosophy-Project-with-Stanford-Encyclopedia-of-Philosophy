    "main_text": "The Status of Determinism in Physical Theories\n4. The Status of Determinism in Physical Theories\n\nJohn Earman\u2019s Primer on Determinism (1986) remains the\nrichest storehouse of information on the truth or falsity of\ndeterminism in various physical theories, from classical mechanics to\nquantum mechanics and general relativity. (See also his update on the\nsubject, \u201cAspects of Determinism in Modern Physics\u201d\n(2007)). Here I will give only a brief discussion of some key issues,\nreferring the reader to Earman (1986) and other resources for more\ndetail. Figuring out whether well-established theories are\ndeterministic or not (or to what extent, if they fall only a bit\nshort) does not do much to help us know whether our world is\nreally governed by deterministic laws; all our current best\ntheories, including General Relativity and the Standard Model of\nparticle physics, are too flawed and ill-understood to be mistaken for\nanything close to a Final Theory. Nevertheless, as Earman stressed,\nthe exploration is very valuable because of the way it deepens our\nunderstanding of the richness and complexity of determinism.\n",
