    "main_text": "\n\nZombies in philosophy are imaginary creatures designed to illuminate\nproblems about consciousness and its relation to the physical world.\nUnlike the ones in films or witchcraft, they are exactly like us in\nall physical respects but without conscious experiences: by definition\nthere is \u2018nothing it is like\u2019 to be a zombie. Yet zombies\nbehave just like us, and some even spend a lot of time discussing\nconsciousness.\n\nFew people, if any, think zombies actually exist. But many hold they\nare at least conceivable, and some that they are possible. It seems\nthat if zombies really are possible, then physicalism is false and\nsome kind of dualism is true. For many philosophers that is the chief\nimportance of the zombie idea. But it is also valuable for the\nstimulus and focus it gives to wider philosophical theorizing about\nconsciousness and other aspects of the mind. It also figures in more\ngeneral metaphysical and epistemological investigations, for example\nby raising questions about the relations between imaginability,\nconceivability, and possibility, and by reactivating the \u2018other\nminds\u2019 problem.\n",
