Unlike advocating a code, accepting a code is a\nfirst-personal matter. It might include intending to conform\none\u2019s own behavior to that code, feeling guilty when one does\nnot, and so on. One cannot hypocritically accept a code. Indeed,\nhypocrisy is simply a matter of advocating a code one does not accept.\nSo this notion of endorsement is available to someone who is trying to\nprovide a definition of morality in the descriptive sense, even when\nconsidering a single person\u2019s morality.\n\nParadigmatic views in the natural law tradition starting with Aquinas\nhold both that the laws of morality have their source in God, and that\nthese laws constitute the principles of human practical rationality\n(Finnis 1980; MacIntyre 1999). Views in this tradition may be seen as\nusing the basic schema for definitions of morality in the normative\nsense, understanding endorsement as acceptance. Members of this\ntradition typically hold that all rational persons know what kinds of\nactions morality prohibits, requires, discourages, encourages, and\nallows. It is central to Aquinas\u2019s view that morality is known\nto all those whose behavior is subject to moral judgment, even if they\ndo not know of the revelations of Christianity. This is why Aquinas\nholds that knowing what morality prohibits and requires does not\ninvolve knowing why morality prohibits and requires what it does.\n\nThose who belong to the natural law tradition also hold that reason\nendorses acting morally. This sort of endorsement of course has a\ncognitive component. But it is also motivational. Aquinas does not\nhold that knowledge of morality is always effective: it can be blotted\nout by evil persuasions or corrupt habits. But if reason is not\nopposed by such forces, any rational person would not only know what\nwas prohibited and required by morality, but would follow those\nprohibitions and requirements. So, for natural law theorists,\nendorsement amounts to acceptance.\n",
