Hope in Political Philosophy\n\nHope can play three distinct roles in politics (see Stahl 2020): It\ncan be instrumentally valuable insofar as its motivating influence\nmakes it more likely that people achieve politically desirable goals.\nIt can also be constitutive of politics, in that it is necessary for\ncertain hopes to be present for the space of the political to emerge\nat all. For example, Spinoza argues that citizens can only act\ntogether politically if they have civic hope, through which they see\neach other as sources of potential benefits (Steinberg 2018: 90).\nLastly, hope can also play a justificatory role, insofar it is\npossible that certain policies can only be publicly justified by\nreference to hopes that those promoting them reasonably entertain.\n\nThe potential for hope to both motivate and mislead is widely\ndiscussed in ancient and modern philosophy, but systematic accounts of\nthe political relevance of hope stem only from the 20th century (for\nan overview, see Bl\u00f6ser, Huber and Moellendorf 2020). Many of these\ncontributions can be understood as raising questions about the\npossible justifications of being guided in one\u2019s political\nagency by hope, on the one hand, and about the benefits and risks of\nhope for politics on the other.\n\nRegarding the first question about the justification of hope, one of\nthe earliest and most ambitious accounts can be found in Ernst\nBloch\u2019s The Principle of Hope. Bloch advances his\nargument in the context of a debate in early 20th-century Marxism,\ndistinguishing between what he calls the \u201ccold\u201d and the\n\u201cwarm stream\u201d: The first designates the materialist\ninsight that all historical developments are conditioned and\nconstrained by concrete, existing material conditions, \u201cstrict\ndeterminations that cannot be skipped over\u201d (Bloch\n[1954\u201359] 1986: I:208), whereas the second acknowledges a\nprocessual constitution of reality which is captured by hope. Hope, in\nother words, is justified by its correctly grasping facts about the\nworld. In particular, Bloch describes hope as always related to the\n\u201cnot-yet-conscious\u201d that in turn reflects \u201cobjective\npossibilities\u201d. This idea is related to Bloch\u2019s processual\nmetaphysics, according to which objective tendencies and possibilities\ninteract with \u201cclosed\u201d matters of fact, such that the\nmoment of potentiality surpassing into actuality always opens up\nopportunities for the interventions of active decision-making. The\nright way to relate to these opportunities is, according to Bloch,\n\u201cmilitant optimism\u201d, i.e., not a mere assumption that\nthings will develop in a desirable direction, but an active attitude\ntowards real tendencies with the goal to realize them (Bloch\n[1954\u201359] 1986: I:201). Arguing from these premises, Bloch\ndevelops an integrated theory in which hope is not merely a subjective\ncombination of desires and beliefs about probabilities or facts, but\nrather a reflection of metaphysical possibilities in the world and\npart of a range of human capacities that make it possible to relate to\nthat which is not yet, but which is already prefigured in the\nobjective potentials of reality.\n\nWhile most contemporary political philosophers acknowledge that many\nof our political hopes are grounded in reality, few go as far as Bloch\nto also see a general attitude of hopefulness as justified by\nmetaphysical considerations. In Law of Peoples, Rawls, for\nexample, holds that political theories need to develop a\n\u201crealistic utopia\u201d of justice to reliably guide our\npolitical agency and to \u201csupport and strengthen\u201d our\npolitical hopes (Rawls 2003: 23). Howard (2019: 300) argues that such\na utopia refers to an outcome that is possible and reachable under\nfavorable conditions, but which may be extremely improbable\nnevertheless. Following Kant, Rawls seems to assume that the main\njustification for our political hopes for justice seems to come from\nthe fact that we need such hopes to be able to continue to be moved by\nconsiderations of justice, and that it would be unreasonable to give\nup political hope for that reason. Bourke (forthcoming) takes a\ncloser look at the similarities and differences between Kant and Rawls\nregarding their justifications of belief and hope.\n\nIn similar terms, some contemporary authors think of a disposition to\nhave certain hopes as a democratic virtue that can be fostered or\nundermined by states. Moellendorf (2006) makes an argument to this\neffect that is restricted to societies transitioning from severe\ninjustice towards justice: Because citizens need hopes to be\nmotivationally capable to engage in the risky activities necessary to\npursue societal change, and because hopes for a more just future can\nsupport their self-respect under unjust circumstances, institutions of\ntransitional societies must supply the \u201cinstitutional bases of\nhope\u201d, such as possibilities for free political campaigning and\nopen debate. Snow (2018: 414) argues that societies that do not offer\ncitizens \u201csecure attachment\u201d create \u201cworrier\u201d\ncitizens that are more likely to succumb to paranoid nationalism,\nwhereas \u201ccarers\u201d who are hopeful citizens are more likely\nto embrace a more inclusive national identity. More narrowly, Snow\ndefines \u201ccivic hope\u201d as an \u201centrenched disposition\nof openness to the political possibilities a democratic government can\nprovide. Hope must include the belief that the ends of democracy are\npossible\u201d (2018: 419) and argues\u2014drawing on the pragmatist\ntradition (see section 2.6 above)\u2014that this disposition is a\nvirtue that contributes to the flourishing of their lives as citizens\nas well as of the state they live in.\n\nWhile most contemporary liberal views follow these arguments in\nreplacing Bloch\u2019s metaphysical foundations of hope with moral\njustifications, defenders of \u201cunjustifiable\u201d political\nhope, such as Richard Rorty, argue for the more radical claim that we\ncannot, as a matter of principle, provide any fundamental\njustification for the desirability of the outcomes that we hope for.\nAs Rorty famously rejects the idea of a political philosophy that is\nbased on privileged knowledge or insight, he argues that\n\u201cliberal hope\u201d (i.e., hope for the emergence and\nsustenance of liberal societies) similarly cannot be based on any\nfoundations\u2014such as knowledge about probabilities. Rather, it is\nan attitude by which those who have it express their commitment to\ncertain forms of future interaction and their belief in their\npossibility. In Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, Rorty\ncorrespondingly contrasts two forms of liberalism: The \u201cliberal\nmetaphysician\u201d expects social cooperation to be based on\nscientific or philosophical insight that penetrates individual\nidiosyncrasy and aims at the adoption of a universal, final vocabulary\nthat then leads to solidarity. By contrast, the \u201cliberal\nironist\u201d renounces the idea of a final vocabulary and instead\nassumes that only the contingent overlap between \u201cselfish\nhopes\u201d can be a source of the solidarity that grounds the\ncommitment to liberal principles (Rorty 1989: 93). As Smith (2005)\nnotes, Rorty does not intend to argue for unjustified hope (hope for\nwhich there is no adequate justification, although such justification\nis possible). Rather, he must refer to a form of hope for which the\nquestion of an ultimate justification does not arise, since it does\nnot incorporate the idea that it is based on any such\njustification.\n\nWhile the authors surveyed so far all agree on a positive role of hope\nin politics, there is also a more skeptical tradition in political\nthought that either questions whether hope in the standard sense is\nalways available to political agents or argues that, at least\nsometimes, hope ought to be abandoned for political reasons.\n\nOne set of arguments revolves around whether the positive aspects of\npolitical hope are accessible to everyone as classic liberal accounts\nof hope seem to assume. Stockdale (2021) argues that many hopes of\nmembers of oppressed groups are not forms of pleasurable anticipation,\nbut \u201cfearful hope\u201d, that is, hope for avoiding the worst\neffects of their oppression. In this sense, hope is not always\nsomething that ought to be preserved. Of course, this does not exclude\nmore positive hopes, such as hoping for a less oppressive future. A\nmore radical challenge to the idea that specific, objectual hopes are\nalways available as a response to injustice is to be found in\nLear\u2019s (2006) reflections on \u201cradical hope\u201d. Lear\nconsiders a situation\u2014such as that which members of the Crow\nnation may have faced after they were forced to live on reservations\nand, as a consequence, their traditional form of life became\nimpossible\u2014where, as a result of historical catastrophe, the\nvocabulary with which a group makes sense of the good collapses, and\nthe only thing they can hope for is that a new version of a good life\nwill become possible\u2014a version they currently lack the words to\nconceptualize.\n\nA second, skeptical argument is concerned with the objection that hope\nin politics might serve to encourage wishful thinking or undermine a\nrealistic, critical evaluation of social reality (see Bl\u00f6ser, Huber\nand Moellendorf 2020 for an overview): It is often equated with\noptimism (see Eagleton 2015 for an argument that does not do so) and\nthus a naive approach to politics. It is said to disempower since hope\ninvolves seeing the outcome as dependent on factors beyond one\u2019s\ncontrol, and to misdirect our agency towards Utopian goals. As\nMoellendorf (2019: 154) argues, all hope imposes opportunity costs,\nsince it precludes alternative attitudes which may be more\ninstrumentally valuable. Political realists (such as Sleat 2013) argue\nthat hope may be a necessary element of politics, but will by\nnecessity go beyond that which is actually possible and thus mislead\nour political agency. Although these arguments draw attention to the\ndangers of hope in politics that have to be taken seriously, a\nbalanced judgment must also take into account the dimensions of value\ndiscussed above. Indeed, philosophers working in the field of climate\nchange often emphasize the instrumental value of hope in sustaining\naction where the attainment of the ultimate goal\u2014managing\nclimate change\u2014is uncertain (McKinnon 2014, Roser 2019).\nMoellendorf highlights the need to develop hopeful politics when\ndiscussing climate issues (Moellendorf 2022).\n\nA third argument finally confronts the fundamental issue of whether\nhope and hopefulness are always as desirable in politics as much of\nthe preceding arguments have assumed. Warren (2015), for example,\nargues that the discourse and the valuation of political hope in Black\nAmerican politics, serves to appropriate a theological notion of hope\nand uses it to enforce a \u201ccompulsory investment\u201d of Black\npeople\u2019s hope in the political\u2014although the resulting\npolitics only prolongs and reinforces the racist structures towards\nthe ending of which their political hope is ostensibly directed.\nInstead, Warren advocates for \u201cBlack nihilism\u201d, that is,\nthe rejection of the metaphysical and political framework in which\npolitical hope operates (see Lloyd 2018, Winters 2019 for discussion).\nBut even Warren leaves space for \u201cspiritual hope\u201d as a\nhope for the end of political hope.\n",
