For example, Marie Curie isn\u2019t a present\nthing, but she has existed. This appears to be a counterexample to\nP2.\n\nOne might reply here that P2 isn\u2019t\nfalse (for the reason just given) because there are no\nnon-present entities\u2014presentists don\u2019t think that there\nis something, Curie, that exists and isn\u2019t present. To\nwork through the details here, it\u2019s important to start talking\nabout what presentists accept in the domain of their most unrestricted\nquantifiers. That is, P2 isn\u2019t false\nbecause there are no non-present entities in the relevant domain of\nquantification. Suppose that we read P2 in\nthe following way: \u201cfor any x, if x has\nexisted, exists now, or will exist, then x is present\u201d.\nAnd, following Thomas Crisp (2004), presentists may read the\nquantifier \u201cfor any\u2026\u201d as \u201cfor any\u2026\nwithin time\u201d (depending on views about the existence of timeless\nentities). If we shift to this reading, it\u2019s no longer obvious\nthat P2 is false. It\u2019s true that\nthere once was an entity, Marie Curie, who doesn\u2019t exist at all\nanymore. But it\u2019s not clear that Curie must be within the\nrelevant domain of quantification simply in virtue of having once\nexisted. So, if we read P2 as \u201cfor\nany x (within time), if x has existed, exists now,\nor will exist, then x is present\u201d\u2014and we deny\nthat there are any non-present entities\u2014then\nP2 isn\u2019t false (Crisp 2004:\n18\u201320). And, if P2 isn\u2019t\nfalse, then premise (3) is false, and the argument is\nunsound.\n\nOf course, whether one thinks that this kind of strategy is successful\nwill likely depend upon how one understands the locution \u201cfor\nany x\u201d. Not everyone will be persuaded. For instance,\nUlrich Meyer (2005: 214, 2013: 68\u201369), when advancing his own\n\u201csceptical\u201d challenge to presentism, considers a statement\nof presentism that\u2019s very similar to the reading of\nP2 offered by Crisp (2004), in which the\nstatement of presentism is equivalent to the claim that \u201conly\npresent entities exist temporally\u201d. (On the assumption that\n\u201cx exists within time\u201d and \u201cx\nexists temporally\u201d are the very same notion, the two statements\nare equivalent.) However, Meyer argues that it\u2019s clear enough\nthat Curie exists temporally. After all, she has existed! And what can\n\u201cx exists temporally\u201d (or \u201cx\nexists\u201d) mean if not, simply, \u201cx has existed,\nexists now, or will exist\u201d?\n",
