    "main_text": "Direct, Extensional Arguments || For Externalism\n3.1 For Externalism\n3.1.1 Undergeneration Arguments\n\n\nWe have already encountered one of the most powerful sources of\nextensional opposition to nontrivial versions of reasons internalism\nin the form of the Central Problem. The Central Problem is that it\nseems that some actions are wrong for everyone no matter what they are\nlike, and that their wrongness for someone requires that that person\nhave a reason not to do them. But many kinds of internalism\u2014in\nparticular Actual State views\u2014say that an agent has a reason\nonly if she satisfies a certain condition, and hence that her reason\ndepends on what she is like. We can even frame the Central Problem by\ndivorcing it from Moral Rationalism and Moral Absolutism, and simply\ninsisting that for at least some actions (perhaps paradigmatic wrong\nactions among them), there is a reason for anyone not to do those\nactions, no matter what she is like. This leads to a direct argument\nagainst many forms of internalism: that they\nundergenerate reasons, by providing negative verdicts in cases\nin which intuitively there really are reasons.\n\n\nBecause this sort of argument has not always gotten a grip on those\nskeptical about the objective authority of morality, one important\ndevelopment since the 1970s is the observation that a similar sort of\nproblem arises for prudential reasons (e.g. Nagel\n1970). If I am going to travel to Israel in six months\u2019 time and\nwill regret not knowing any Hebrew once I get there, then I have a\nreason to study Hebrew now, even if I don\u2019t now care about my\nfuture regrets or about whether I will know Hebrew while I am in\nIsrael. Yet internalist theses place constraints on what I\nnow have a reason to do, on the basis of what my actual\npsychology is like now, or on the basis of what\ncounterfactuals are true of me now. So they appear to\nhave a problem in getting these intuitive judgments about reasons\nright. This argument is thought to produce extra dialectical\nleverage, because these intuitions about prudential reasons are thought\nto be harder to give up than corresponding intuitions about moral\nreasons.\n3.1.2 Defenses Against Undergeneration Arguments\n\n\nTwo lines of response are open to the internalist here. One, proposed\nby Mark Schroeder (2007b) in defense of the Humean Theory of Reasons,\ndenies that internalism is genuinely incompatible with the\ninescapability of some moral or prudential reasons. If there are some\nactions that would serve any possible desire (or, on an alternative\ninternalist account, that any agent would be motivated towards under\nthe relevant counterfactual conditions), then the internalist can\naccommodate reasons that any agent has no matter what they are like:\nsuch reasons are massively overdetermined. In this way the\ninternalist can seek to reconcile Moral Rationalism with Moral\nAbsolutism (see section 1.2). The idea is that even if internalism is\ntrue, it might still be the case that we all have reasons to avoid\nmoral wrongdoing, no matter what we are like\u2014because reasons to\navoid moral wrongdoing are generated from any set of desires or\ndispositions.  While this solution is formally available, it remains\nto be seen whether it can plausibly generate the robust set of moral\nand prudential reasons posited by ordinary intuitions, and it appears\nreasonable to be pessimistic on this count; plausibly there are actual\nor possible sets of desires and dispositions that would not support\nany reasons to avoid breaking promises made to those powerless to\nretaliate, or to confess to one\u2019s crime for which somebody else has\nalready been convicted, for example.\n\n\nGenerally, however, internalists bite the bullet and reject the data\nof these \u2018intuitions\u2019. They might simply challenge whether\nthose intuitions really exist or, more audaciously, maintain that they\nare all false. It is not denied that speakers ascribe\nexternal reasons to agents, and so internalists are compelled to offer\ndiagnoses of this practice. The bluntest is to adopt an error\ntheory, and suggest that these practices manifest a mistaken\nunderstanding of the kinds of reasons that there are. This forces\na confrontation between internalism and ordinary practice; most\ninternalists dislike the odds in this matchup and seek to explain away\nthe evidence.\n\n\nA provocative diagnosis of external reasons claims is as a\nbluff or a rhetorical device designed to influence the\nbehavior and attitudes of others (Williams 1979). On this view\nexternal reasons claims are all false but stem from an attempt to apply\nnonrational persuasion on others rather than from error; recently some\nphilosophers have argued that we either do (Kalderon 2005) or should\n(Joyce 2001) use moral claims as convenient fictions for this\npurpose. In later work (1989), Williams proposes, more\ntemperately, that they may be \u2018optimistic internal reasons\nclaims\u2019: likely false statements made in the hope that they\nmay become true through the intended audience\u2019s contemplation of\nthem.\n\n\nA more conciliatory strategy is to claim ambiguity in the notion of\na \u2018reason\u2019. In one sense there are external reasons;\nwe might call them \u2018institutional\u2019 or\n\u2018pseudo\u2019-reasons (Mackie 1977; Joyce 2001). But the\nspirit of internalism is preserved in the claim that these are not\ngenuine practical reasons, about which an internalist thesis is\ncorrect. Recognizing the legitimacy of ascribing these other\nkinds of reasons may suggest softening the distinction between internal\nand external reasons even further; it has been proposed that what\ncounts as a \u2018genuine reason\u2019 is determined by the concerns\ncharacterizing the context of discourse (Finlay 2006). So, for\nexample, we may appropriately judge that the pain a certain action\nwould cause is a reason for a sadist not to perform the\naction, because the salient concern in the context is our\ncompassion for others. This view would prompt us to abandon\nexistence internalism about practical \u2018reasons\u2019 (reasons claims\nare made relative to the concerns salient in the conversation, and not\nnecessarily to the motivations of the agent). On this view of\nreasons, however, an agent can have reasons that count as genuine in a\ngiven context, but that he can ignore without irrationality. Such\na view can preserve the spirit of internalism by claiming that the\nrational force of these reasons for any agent depends upon his desires\nor motivations.\n\n\nThese strategies aim to reconcile internalism, as much as possible,\nwith the apparently externalist tendencies in ordinary practices of\nascribing reasons. Externalists claim they are unsuccessful;\nordinary practice is committed to genuine (and genuinely authoritative)\nexternal reasons, and rightly so. But internalists remain\noptimistic. The issue is very much unresolved.\n3.1.3 Overgeneration Arguments\n\n\nThe literature is also full of extensional arguments against\ntheories which resemble internalism, but on the grounds that they\novergenerate, rather than undergenerate, reasons. Many famous\nand colorful examples\u2014about people who want to eat saucers of\nmud, or count blades of grass, or who have a disposition to turn on\nradios\u2014are offered to show that not every desire or motivation\nis of the right kind to generate practical reasons (Anscombe 1959,\nQuinn 1993). Strictly speaking, however, such cases only create\nobjections to views which postulate a\nsufficient condition for the existence of reasons, and\ninternalism itself postulates only necessary conditions, and\nno such sufficient condition, as Bernard Williams makes clear (1989),\nfor example.\n\n\nThere may, of course, be philosophical reasons why many theorists\nwho accept some version of internalism as a necessary condition on\nreasons are also inclined to accept a sufficient condition of this\nkind, and we will consider one such philosophical reason in the next\nsection. So these may end up being good indirect\narguments against internalism. But no sufficient condition is\npart of internalism by itself, so there are no direct overgeneration\narguments against internalism.\n3.2 For Internalism\n3.2.1 The Significance of Apparent Internal Reasons\n\n\nSo far we have considered extensional arguments against\ninternalism. But there are also extensional arguments in\nfavor of internalist theses. Setting aside peculiarly\nmoral reasons, common sense suggests that ordinary practical\nreasons exhibit a high degree of agent-relativity. It is also\nnatural to think that in at least many cases, different agents have\ndifferent reasons because they want different things. If\nA desires chocolate ice cream, and B desires\nstrawberry ice cream, then intuitively A has a reason to\npurchase the chocolate, and B has a reason to purchase the\nstrawberry. Many have thought that the Humean Theory of Reasons is\nmore than suggested by this sort of extensional data.\n\n\nThe idea behind this reasoning is that if we have to agree that\nsome reasons depend on desires, then we should give serious\nconsideration to the theory according to which all reasons do,\nas being simpler and more explanatory than the theory according to\nwhich some reasons derive from our desires but others do not.\nThis may even provide a promising analytical hypothesis about what\nclaims about reasons mean, or reductive hypothesis about what reasons\nare. This kind of argument is anticipated by Williams\u2019 claim that\nthe issue is whether there are both internal and external reasons, or\ninternal reasons only (1979; see also Schroeder 2007b). We now\ndiscuss three kinds of externalist objection to this argument.\n3.2.2 Three Objections\n\n\nOne line of objection holds that no reasons derive from our\ndesires. It seems plausible that they do only because desire is\nclosely connected to something else, which often is a source\nof reasons: something like pleasure or\nenjoyment (Bond 1983, Millgram 1997, Scanlon 1998).\nReasons that seem to derive from desires can arguably be more plausibly\nexplained by pleasure, which can also serve to explain reasons that\ndesire cannot explain: reasons deriving from pleasures that the\nagent does not actually desire. It may therefore be a better and\nmore explanatory hypothesis that something like pleasure\ngrounds our agent-relative reasons. However proponents of this\nkind of objection often take hedonic states like pleasure to be merely\none instance of something possessing intrinsic value, and\noffer as rivals to HTR theories of reasons as based on intrinsic value\n(see the entry on \n intrinsic vs. extrinsic value).\n\n\n\nIn response, Humeans can observe that in ordinary cases agents\nwant pleasure, and that thereby HTR can accommodate such\nreasons. This line of objection needs a case in which an agent\nhas a reason to do not just something that she does not already desire\nto do, but something that would not serve any desire whatsoever that\nshe already has. Since any given action may serve many different\npossible desires, and agents who do not desire (e.g.) pleasure are rare\nand peculiar, it is difficult to control for these kinds of\nfactors. Externalists can claim that an agent would have a reason\nto do what is pleasurable even in the absence of any such general\ndesire, but this is something that an internalist may be able to deny\nwithout absurdity\u2014although here intuitions seem to differ\nradically.\n\n\nA related objection consists in the complaint that agents can have\ndesires that clearly do not generate any practical reasons because they\nare for worthless objects. Prominent examples in the literature\ninclude a desire to drink a saucer of mud or a can of paint, and a\ndisposition to turn on radios whenever they are off. As noted in\nsection 3.1.3, these examples can\u2019t provide direct counterexamples to\nany sort of reasons internalism, because reasons internalism itself\nplaces only a necessary condition on reasons and not a sufficient\ncondition, and these examples are proposed counterexamples to a\nsufficient condition. But they are highly relevant to the\ntheoretical argument for internalism that is our concern in this\nsection. If we advance as our case for internalism the\nexplanatory power of the thesis that reasons depend on desire or\nmotivation, then it is a significant problem if this relation isn\u2019t\nconsistent and desire or motivation don\u2019t always generate\nreasons. Some explanation of this inconsistency is needed, and\nwhen we find it we may find that it reveals that something other than\ndesire or motivation is the genuine source of our reasons.\n\n\nThese cases are taken to show that desires are only connected with\nreasons if they are also connected with something else, for example\nintrinsic value, and they do not yield reasons otherwise. Against\nthis the internalist can again challenge intuitions and defend the\nconsistency of the connection, by insisting (e.g.) that a desire to\ndrink a saucer of mud is sufficient for having a reason to do so.\nSuch a reason need not be a good or strong one, after all, and the\npeculiarity of claiming that there is such a reason may be explained\naway as being merely pragmatic. In cases in which the reasons for\nan action are dwarfed by the considerations against it, it is usual to\nreport that there is no reason for the action at all; \u2018there is a\nreason to do A\u2019 typically communicates that there is a\nrelatively weighty reason to do A. Whether or not agents\nhave desire-based reasons in these circumstances remains a contested\nissue.\n\n\nA different version of this same sort of objection works by granting\na special connection between reasons and desire but suggesting that\nthis exists because desires involve judgments or perceptions that\nsomething is a reason (e.g. Anscombe 1963, Stampe 1987, Quinn\n1993, Millgram 1997, Scanlon 1998). Scanlon labels these\n\u2018desires in the directed-attention sense\u2019; on this view,\n(apparent) reasons are explanatory of desires, and not the\nreverse. This hypothesis would explain why agents tend to have\nrelevant desires whenever they believe themselves to have\nreasons, but it does not seem well-placed to explain why agents would\nhave these desires whenever they actually have reasons.\nIf we are disposed to ascribe reasons to others in\ncorrespondence with their desires, the Humean hypothesis is better.\n\n\nA third kind of objection (Hampton 1998) insists that though it is\ntrue that some reasons derive from our desires, this is only because of\nmore fundamental reasons which themselves do not derive from our\ndesires. Proponents of this view hold that there is a fundamental\nreason to do what you desire and that changes in what you desire simply\naffect what you need to do in order to go about doing so. This\nview admits that our desires can sometimes affect our reasons but\ninsists that they only do so because there is a further reason, which\ndoes not depend on any desire. Philosophers who accept this view\nare unmoved by the argument that Actual State forms of reason\ninternalism can provide a more unified explanation of reasons.\nThey don\u2019t deny the existence of \u2018internal\u2019 reasons (which\ndo derive from desires), but do hold that internal reasons are simply\nderivative from and hence are explained by a special case of external\nreasons (which do not derive from or depend on desires at all). A\nsimilar dialectic goes for Actual State views which appeal to a more\ngeneral kind of state than \u2018desire\u2019.\n3.3 Relative Explanatory Power\n\n\nAny evaluation of whether Actual State reasons internalism is\nsimpler, more elegant, or explanatorily more powerful than any possible\nexternalist view will have to turn on an evaluation of this kind of\nexternalist explanatory strategy. If internal reasons could be\nsimply derivative from external reasons, and external reasons could be\nindependently explained, then Actual State reasons internalism will\nhave very little traction on these grounds. If the derivation of\ninternal reasons from external reasons turns out to be unsuccessful,\nhowever, or external reasons themselves are difficult to explain, then\nActual State reasons internalism will gain traction as an explanatory\nhypothesis. Schroeder (2007b) attacks the derivation of internal\nreasons from external reasons; here we can go on to consider whether\nexternal reasons are themselves harder to explain than internal\nones.\n\n\nMany philosophers have held that external reasons are, in fact,\nharder to explain than internal ones; even some who were no skeptics\nabout external reasons, like Immanuel Kant (see the entry on\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy.)  \n So what makes external reasons so puzzling? One\nidea is that they are puzzling because they leave so little on the\nbasis of which to explain why they are reasons for the people for whom\nthey are reasons. Internal reasons are shared only by certain\npeople\u2014people with the requisite desires. So Max\u2019s desires\ncan be used to explain why he has the internal reasons that he\nhas. But categorical external reasons like those Kant was\nconcerned about (and which are required in order to reconcile Moral\nRationalism with Moral Absolutism) are supposed to be reasons for any\nagent, no matter what she is like. So the only thing to which we\ncan appeal in order to explain why Max has these reasons is the fact\nthat Max is an agent. Some philosophers have accordingly\ninvested great energy in developing robust enough accounts of agency to\nbe able to explain moral reasons. For example, Christine\nKorsgaard (1996) maintains that reasons derive from the demands of\nautonomy, or being regulated by stable principles that define\nones\u2019 self, which she identifies as a necessary condition for\nacting at all.\n\n\nHowever, even accounts that derive reasons from the nature of agency\nmay ultimately vindicate some form of internalism. David Velleman\n(1996), for example, argues that agency is characterized by a\nparticular higher-order inclination\u2014to \u2018behave in, and out\nof, a knowledge of what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 Although this is a\nkind of desire, it is distinct from the contingent desires that might\nbe satisfied by particular actions and which internalists usually\nidentify as the source of our reasons. Velleman accordingly\ndescribes his view as a \u2018fainthearted externalism\u2019, but it\nremains a form of internalism according to the scheme presented\nhere.\n\n\nSome advocates of various forms of internalism have complained that\nadvocacy of external reasons amounts to nothing more than\n\u2018bluff\u2019 (Williams 1979). A natural way to understand\nthis idea is as the complaint that external reasons theorists leave us\nwith too few constraints on what reasons could be, and hence are able\nto make whatever claims about reasons they want (so long as they\nendorse them in a serious enough tone of voice, perhaps), with no\nindependent way of checking their plausibility. This complaint\ncould be a fair one against externalists who are willing to offer no\ngeneral theory about or constraints on reasons, but it is unfair in\ngeneral. Externalists may simply look for discipline and unity in\ntheir views about reasons from a source distinct from facts about\nmotivation or motivational psychology. Value-based theorists, for\nexample, tie their claims about reasons to commitments about what is\nvaluable. So their claims about what we have reasons to do are\nchecked by the plausibility of the corresponding theses about what is\nvaluable.\n4. The Debate Today\n\n\nThe debate over internal and external reasons is very much alive\ntoday, open on nearly all of the fronts that we have considered in this\narticle. Or more accurately, we should say that the\ndebates over internal and external reasons are very much alive\ntoday. As we saw, there are important differences between State\nand Motivation forms of internalism, between Counterfactual and Actual\nforms of internalism, and between versions that give rise to the\nCentral Problem and those that do not. There are also important\nfurther differences in precisely how to formulate any given version of\nreasons internalism, and we have not precisely formulated any single\nversion in this article.\n\n\nWhat is clear is that there are two main varieties of internalist\nview, each of which faces its own class of problems. Most\ninternalist views encounter the Central Problem, and hence have\ndifficulty in allowing for some of the important reasons that we\npre-theoretically are inclined to think that there are. Though\nother arguments have been offered against them, this challenge is at\nthe heart of their difficulties. We saw that some Counterfactual\nversions of internalism avoid the Central Problem, by claiming that the\nrelevant counterfactuals are not grounded in any features of agents\u2019\nactual psychologies, but rather are explained in some other way.\nThe challenge facing these views is to provide such an explanation\nwithout collapsing into triviality, as with the view that the relevant\ncounterfactual condition is \u2018that the agent is motivated by all\nof her reasons\u2019.\n\n\nExternalist views, on the other hand, avoid the Central Problem and\nhence do well with moral reasons, but critics worry that external\nreasons are more mysterious, and that such theories cannot provide as\nattractive an explanation of why some reasons do\nappear to be internal. An attractive way forward may have to show\nentrenched parties how to achieve some of the important advantages of\neach side of the debate.",
