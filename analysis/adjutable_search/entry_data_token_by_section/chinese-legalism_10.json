Ordering the Bureaucracy\n\nTo rule and control the people effectively, the government should rely\non an extensive bureaucracy; but this bureaucracy in turn should be\nproperly staffed and tightly monitored. It is with this regard that\nthe fa thinkers made a lasting contribution to China\u2019s\nadministrative thought and administrative practices. Their strongly\npronounced suspicion of scheming ministers and selfish officials was\nconducive to the promulgation of impersonal means of recruitment,\npromotion, demotion, and performance control. These means became\nindispensable for China\u2019s bureaucratic apparatus for millennia\nto come (Creel 1974).\n",
