    "main_text": "Gottlob Frege\n3. Gottlob Frege\n\nFrege\u2019s logical contributions grew out of a different soil, and\nwere made (as far as can be determined) entirely independently of the\nAnglo-American algebraic tradition of Boole, De Morgan, and Peirce.\nInstead they have their root in the work on the foundations of real\nanalysis by such German mathematicians as Dirichlet, Riemann,\nWeierstrass, and Heine. From this tradition Frege took, first, the\nidea of providing a rigorous foundation for mathematics (a project\nthat, in his hands, became the project of showing that arithmetic can\nbe grounded in the laws of logic); and, secondly, the central\nmathematical concepts of function and variable,\nwhich he employed in place of the Aristotelian concepts of\npredicate and subject. This latter step led him\nnaturally to a logic of relations (since the functions considered in\nmathematics were multivariate); and his analysis of mathematical\ninference also led him to introduce a notation for quantificational\nlogic. (Mathematicians such as Weierstrass, in his analysis of the\nlimit concept, was already sensitive to the \u201cnesting\u201d of\nquantifiers, and the importance of their ordering: to the difference,\nfor example, between saying \u201cfor every \\(\\varepsilon\\) there\nexists a \\(\\delta\\)\u201d, and \u201cthere exists a \\(\\delta\\) such\nthat for every \\(\\varepsilon\\)\u201d. What was required now, and what\nFrege supplied, was a formal language to express and make explicit the\nquantificational inferences already present in the work of the German\nanalysts.) So, at a single stroke, in the Begriffsschrift of\n1879, Frege took the two major steps beyond traditional\nlogic\u2014relations and quantifiers\u2014that the algebraic\ntradition had taken separately and decades apart. \n\nFrege\u2019s logical system had several advantages over Peirce. His\naxiomatic presentation of a purely syntactic calculus was considerably\nmore precise, and his analysis of the number concept went deeper. His\nsystem permitted both variables and functions to be quantified. This\nwas a central component of his program for providing a logical\nfoundation for arithmetic, since, in his logical system, identity,\ncardinal number, and mathematical induction were all defined\nvia higher-order quantifications. In his Grundlagen\n(1884) he distinguishes between concepts of different order, so that\nif concept A falls under concept B, then B is of\n\u201csecond-order\u201d (\u00a753). In the more technical treatment\nin his Grundgesetze (1893) he considered third-order\nquantifications, though his actual derivation of arithmetic proceeded\nentirely within second-order logic.\n\nFrege was thus one of the first logicians to recognize the importance\nof a hierarchy of logical levels. His discovery was virtually\nsimultaneous with Peirce\u2019s, and arrived at entirely\nindependently, in pursuit of different goals. Frege\u2019s discovery\nwas to have the greater impact. It formed the basis for\nRussell\u2019s theory of types (and also, decades later, influenced\nCarnap, who studied logic with Frege).\n\nBut although Frege distinguished between logical levels, he did not\nisolate the portion of his quantificational system that ranges only\nover variables of the first order as a distinct system of logic: nor\nwould it have been natural for him to have done so. In this respect,\nthere is a significant contrast with Peirce. Frege\u2019s project was\nto show that arithmetic could be grounded in the laws of logic: for\nhim, there was only one logic, and logic necessarily included the\nlogic of higher-order concepts. Peirce, in contrast, rejected the\nnotion of a single, over-arching logic, instead thinking in terms of\nlogics that vary according to the \u201cuniverse of discourse\u201d.\nLargely for this reason he came closer in his 1885 paper to isolating\nthe propositional calculus, the \u201clogic of first\nintention\u201d, and the \u201clogic of second intention\u201d as\ndistinct systems, each worthy of study in its own right: in that\nregard, he was closer to modern conceptions than was Frege. There is a\nfurther and subtler difference. Peirce\u2019s \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\Pi\\)\nnotation for the quantifiers was explicitly conceived of in terms of\n(possibly infinite) conjunctions and disjunctions of propositions\nabout individuals. This is a highly suggestive conception that is hard\nto represent in Frege\u2019s system of notation. L\u00f6wenheim was\nto exploit it in his early work in model theory, leading to technical\ndiscoveries that were ultimately to call attention to first-order\nlogic. But all this work lay decades in the future, and neither Frege\nnor Peirce can be credited with a modern understanding of the\ndifference between first-order and higher-order logics.\n",
