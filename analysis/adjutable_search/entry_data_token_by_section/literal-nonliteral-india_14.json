    "main_text": "Criticizing the Distinction || Jainism\n4.2 Jainism\nOriginating with Mah\u0101v\u012bra, who lives around the same time as Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism (sixth century BCE), Jainism is known for its emphasis on language\u2019s representational limitations. This is because of its view that reality is multi-faceted (anek\u0101ntav\u0101da) and any single description will necessarily involve some apparent contradiction, due to the fact that it is incomplete (Balcerowicz 2001). Without relativization to a standpoint (naya), the sentences \u201co is P\u201d and \u201co is not-P\u201d are contradictory. To address this, Jainas propose that there are seven ways to characterize any purported fact, each one preceded by a marker of uncertainty, sy\u0101t. Any object o and its property P can be described as:\n\no is P.\no is not-P.\no is both P and not-P.\no is beyond words.\no is beyond words and P.\no is beyond words and not-P.\no is beyond words and both P and not-P.\n\nThis seven-fold schema is found in many Jaina texts, from the early works of Kundakunda (3rd to 6th centuries) up to the to the important Flower Garland of Conditional Predication (Sy\u0101dv\u0101dama\u00f1jar\u012b) of Malli\u1e63e\u1e47a (13th century CE). While some, like Priest (2008), have argued that this seven-fold classification scheme lends itself to a paraconsistent (and perhaps also dialethic) formalization, it need not be, as within the scheme, each of the seven standpoints follows the law of non-contradiction, though within a many-valued truth-system (Ganeri 2002; Schang 2013). On this interpretation, the truth of an utterance is relativized to a particular context, in the sense that each standpoint restricts the context, as Balcerowicz argues, through indices such as space, time, convention, and so on (Balcerowicz 2001). (Balcerowicz also questions whether modern formalization is an eisegetical enterprise, reading into the text conceptions of axiomatization which were not present; see Balcerowicz 2015.) Minimally, according to Siddhar\u1e63iga\u1e47i (ca tenth century CE), one must include in one\u2019s analysis of any given utterance the speaker\u2019s intention and the relevant linguistic connections (Clerbout, Gorisse, & Rahman 2018). The schema, further, is hierarchically ordered, so that each standpoint includes more indices than the prior, according to Malli\u1e63e\u1e47a (Balcerowicz 2001).\nEmphasis on speaker\u2019s intention is crucial for Jainas, especially insofar as they hold to a division between two standpoints: the ordinary standpoint (vyavah\u0101ranaya) and the transcendent or ultimate standpoint (ni\u015bcayanaya, p\u0101ram\u0101rthikanaya). Ultimately speaking, language cannot be said to have any inherent communicative power, but rather it functions due to the speaker\u2019s authority and position as having unmediated access to the truth. In fact, the Jainas hold that scriptures containing the words of Mah\u0101v\u012bra are not efficacious due to the words themselves\u2014a stark contrast to the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 view of an unauthored Veda\u2014but due to a unique suggestive power as well as the religious purity of the listener. As a result of these principles, any single utterance is susceptible to a number of different analyses. Fl\u00fcgel (2010) distinguishes between four kinds of analysis in Jaina thinking about language:\n\nPrinciples and criteria for religious speech\nGeneral rules and clauses for language usage\nContext-sensitive rules for proper ways of speaking\nExamples considering social implications\n\nThe existence of normative criteria governing language use, aiming at the avoidance of harm (ahi\u1e41s\u0101) and the preservation of truth (satya) can be compared to Gricean conversational maxims, although the intentional flouting of these principles does not lead to conversational implicatures. In fact, Jaina doctrines discourage ambiguity and emphasize precise speech (Fl\u00fcgel 2010).\n",
