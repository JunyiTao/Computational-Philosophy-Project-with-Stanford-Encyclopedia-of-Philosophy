    "main_text": "Inductive Arguments\n1. Inductive Arguments\n\nLet us begin by considering some common kinds of examples of inductive arguments. Consider the following two arguments:\n\n\nExample 1. Every raven in a random sample of 3200\nravens is black. This strongly supports the following conclusion: All\nravens are black.\n\nExample 2. 62 percent of voters in a random sample of\n400 registered voters (polled on February 20, 2004) said that they\nfavor John Kerry over George W. Bush for President in the 2004\nPresidential election. This supports with a probability of at least\n.95 the following conclusion: Between 57 percent and 67 percent of all\nregistered voters favor Kerry over Bush for President (at or around\nthe time the poll was taken).\n\n\nThis kind of argument is often called an induction by\nenumeration. It is closely related to the technique of statistical\nestimation. We may represent the logical form of such arguments\nsemi-formally as follows:\n\n\nPremise: In random sample S consisting of n members of\npopulation B, the proportion of members that have attribute\nA is r.\n\nTherefore, with degree of support p,\n\nConclusion: The proportion of all members of B that have\nattribute A is between \\(r-q\\) and \\(r+q\\) (i.e., lies within\nmargin of error q of r).\n\n\nLet\u2019s lay out this argument more formally. The premise breaks\ndown into three separate\n statements:[1]\n\n\n\n\n\nSemi-formalization\nFormalization \n\nPremise 1\nThe frequency (or proportion) of members with attribute A\namong the members of S is r.\n\\(F[A,S] = r\\) \n\nPremise 2\nS is a random sample of B with respect to whether\nor not its members have A\n Rnd[\\(S,B,A\\)] \n\nPremise 3\nSample S has exactly n members\nSize[\\(S] = n\\) \n\nTherefore\nwith degree of support p\n\\(========\\{p\\}\\) \n\nConclusion\nThe proportion of members of B that have attribute\nA lies between \\(r-q\\) and \\(r+q\\) (i.e., lies within\nmargin of error q of r)\n\\(F[A,B] = r \\pm q\\) \n\n\n\nAny inductive logic that treats such arguments should address two\nchallenges. (1) It should tell us which enumerative inductive\narguments should count as good inductive arguments. In\nparticular, it should tell us how to determine the appropriate\ndegree p to which such premises inductively\nsupport the conclusion, for a given margin of error q. (2)\nIt should demonstrably satisfy the\n CoA.\n That is, it should be provable (as a metatheorem) that if a\nconclusion expressing the approximate proportion for an attribute in a\npopulation is true, then it is very likely that sufficiently\nnumerous random samples of the population will provide true premises\nfor good inductive arguments that confer degrees of\nsupport p approaching 1 for that true\nconclusion\u2014where, on pain of triviality, these sufficiently\nnumerous samples are only a tiny fraction of a large population.\nThe supplement on\n Enumerative Inductions: Bayesian Estimation and Convergence,\n shows precisely how a a Bayesian account of enumerative induction may\nmeet these two challenges.\n\nEnumerative induction is, however, rather limited in scope. This form\nof induction is only applicable to the support of claims involving\nsimple universal conditionals (i.e., claims of form \u2018All\nBs are As\u2019) and claims about the proportion of an\nattribute in a population (i.e., claims of form \u2018the frequency\nof As among the Bs is r\u2019). But, many\nimportant empirical hypotheses are not reducible to this simple form,\nand the evidence for these hypotheses is not composed of an\nenumeration of such instances. Consider, for example, the Newtonian\nTheory of Mechanics:\n\n\nAll objects remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by\nsome external force. An object\u2019s acceleration (i.e., the rate at\nwhich its motion changes from rest or from uniform motion) is in the\nsame direction as the force exerted on it; and the rate at which the\nobject accelerates due to a force is equal to the magnitude of the\nforce divided by the object\u2019s mass. If an object exerts a force\non another object, the second object exerts an equal amount of force\non the first object, but in the opposite direction to the force\nexerted by the first object.\n\n\nThe evidence for (and against) this theory is not gotten by examining\na randomly selected subset of objects and the forces acting upon them.\nRather, the theory is tested by calculating what this theory\nsays (or implies) about observable phenomena in a wide\nvariety of specific situations\u2014e.g., ranging from simple\ncollisions between small bodies to the trajectories of planets and\ncomets\u2014and then seeing whether those phenomena occur in the way\nthat the theory says they will. This approach to testing\nhypotheses and theories is ubiquitous, and should be captured by an adequate inductive logic.\n\nMore generally, for a wide range of cases where inductive\nreasoning is important, enumerative induction is inadequate. Rather,\nthe kind of evidential reasoning that judges the likely truth of hypotheses \non the basis of what\nthey say (or imply) about the evidence is more appropriate.\nConsider the kinds of inferences jury members are supposed to make,\nbased on the evidence presented at a murder trial. The inference to\nprobable guilt or innocence is based on a patchwork of evidence of\nvarious kinds. It almost never involves consideration of a randomly\nselected sequences of past situations when people like the accused\ncommitted similar murders. Or, consider how a doctor diagnoses her\npatient on the basis of his symptoms. Although the frequency of\noccurrence of various diseases when similar symptoms have been present may\nplay a role, this is clearly not the whole story. Diagnosticians\ncommonly employ a form of hypothesis evaluation\u2014e.g.,\nwould the hypothesis that the patient has a brain tumor account for his symptoms?; or are these symptoms more likely the result of\na minor stroke?; or may some other hypothesis better account for the\npatient\u2019s symptoms? Thus, a fully adequate account of inductive\nlogic should explicate the logic of hypothesis evaluation,\nthrough which a hypothesis or theory may be tested on the basis of\nwhat it says (or \"predicts\") about observable phenomena. In\n Section 3\n we will see how a kind of probabilistic inductive logic called \"Bayesian Inference\" or\n\"Bayesian Confirmation Theory\" captures such reasoning. The full logical\nstructure of such arguments will be spelled out in that section.\n",
