    "main_text": "The Evolutionary Becoming of Spatiality and Materiality\n2. The Evolutionary Becoming of Spatiality and Materiality\n\nSpace is often thought of as relatively static in comparison with the\ndynamism of time. Time moves forward, we often say, while space is\ncommonly conceived as merely an empty gap that passively rests\nbetween, for example, the walls of a house or the beams of a bridge.\nWhat would it mean, however, to question this dualistic opposition of\nspace and time? What if space were also thought of as dynamic and\nmoving? And what impact would this revised conception of space have on\nphilosophical ideas about the bodies that inhabit space? As some\nfeminists have argued, rethinking spatiality as becoming, rather than\nas static being, can help philosophy rethink bodily life and\nmateriality in dynamic ways as well. Given the long-association of\nwomen with bodies and materiality, moreover, the reconceptualization\nof the latter has important implications for women and feminism.\n\nIn Architecture from the Outside: Essays on Virtual and Real\nSpace (2001), Elizabeth Grosz explores these conceptual questions\nabout space, time, and materiality by working in the intersections of\narchitecture and philosophy. Engaging in \u201cconceptual or\nphilosophical [rather than concretely architectural]\nexperiments,\u201d she forces architecture to examine the importance\nof temporality and sexuality for practices of building and making and\nattempts to render both architecture\u2019s and philosophy\u2019s concepts of\nspace more dynamic and fluid (2001, xviii). Grosz argues that\narchitecture is problematic from a feminist perspective because it\nlargely has ignored questions of sexual and racial differences. Not\nputting enough women\u2019s bathrooms, relative to men\u2019s, in concert halls,\nauditoriums, and other public buildings that draw large numbers of\npeople is one simple example of this neglect. Yet it also can be seen\nin the more complex ways that spaces are gendered and raced. How, for\nexample, does architecture contribute to raced and racist urban spaces\nby aiding the gentrified rebuilding of inner cities, a process that\ntends to displace poor, non-white populations for the benefit of\nmiddle class white people? Architecture\u2019s neglect of questions such as\nthese is a serious matter for Grosz. Nonetheless, she argues that as a\nkind of liminal point between culture and nature, the field of\narchitecture also presents an ideal opportunity for feminists to\ntrouble many of the absolutized binary categories that often plague\nphilosophy: inside and outside, self and other, and subject and\nobject, to name just a few. It might also help philosophy \u201cthink\nof itself more humbly as a mode of producing rather than as a mode of\nknowing or intellectually grasping or mastering concepts, moving\n[philosophy] closer to everyday life and its concerns, which would be\ngood for [it]\u201d (2001, 6). As a self-proclaimed\n\u201coutsider\u201d to architecture\u2014a term used playfully\ngiven that she will smudge the lines between inside and\noutside\u2014Grosz thus traverses the boundaries between architecture\nand philosophy to address questions of materiality and becoming that\nmight produce changes in the lived experience of spatiality.\n\nGrosz is interested in a philosophy that would integrate dynamic and\nproductive notions of change and time into that of space. On her view,\nsuch integration would help both architects and philosophers think of\nspace in dynamic and creative, rather than static and worn-out ways.\nAccording to Grosz, such a philosophy requires above all\n\u201cpragmatic models\u201d (2001, 120). With the term\n\u201cpragmatic,\u201d Grosz includes thinkers in both the\ntraditions of American and continental philosophy who operate with a\n\u201cself-consciously evolutionary orientation\u201d (2001, 169).\nThis \u201cphilosophical pragmatism meanders from Darwin, through\nNietzsche, to the work of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, Henri\nBergson, and eventually through various lines of descent, into the\ndiverging positions of Richard Rorty, on the one hand, and Gilles\nDeleuze on the other\u201d (2001, 169). Positioning herself within\nthis lineage, Grosz affirms \u201cpragmatist philosophers who put the\nquestions of action, practice, and movement at the center of\nontology\u201d (2001, 169). Doing so allows them, for example, to\n\u201cunderstand[d] the [inorganic] thing as question, as\nprovocation\u201d for organic life (2001, 169).\nThis would be to take becoming and an evolutionary openness to the\nfuture various seriously for it would dare to think of the so-called\ninanimate, static thing as continuous with animate, dynamic,\norganic\u2014including human\u2014life. Doing so would operate with\nthe distinction between animate and inanimate in order to show their\ninteractions. It would acknowledge that the animate and the inanimate\nexist as poles on a continuum, where differences shade into one\nanother rather than stand starkly apart.\n\nIn questioning conventional boundaries between thing and non-thing,\nGrosz\u2019s goal is not to completely collapse all distinctions between\nbinary categories, but rather to complicate their relationships so\nthat new possibilities might open up. Likewise, the purpose of her\nwork is not to urge the attempt to live in a world of total\nflux\u2014as if such a thing were possible. Following James, Grosz\ninstead insists that the \u201cteeming flux of the real\u201d must\nbe rendered into discrete objects and that human beings are not able\nto choose not to do so (2001, 179). What she adds, however, is that\nphilosophy and architecture need to recognize that categories for\nobjectifying the world do not fully capture it in all its complex\nmultiplicity and that there is a residue that remains. This residual\nexcess is not in rigid opposition to objects and categories; rather it\nand the world of flux are continuous with the world of discrete\nobjects, in dialogue and movement with them. To think the relationship\nbetween flux and object as Grosz would have philosophers do is to\nthink the thing as she has described it: as a fluid \u201cpoint of\ncrossing\u201d rather than as a static fixity (2001, 171).\n\nGrosz does not often provide explicit details about how such a\n\u201cphilosophical pragmatism\u201d might benefit feminism. Indeed,\nas she says of herself in an interview that composes chapter one of\nthe book, \u201cI feel sure that in order to keep my feminist work\nalive I have to keep it at bay, at a bit of a distance\u201d (2001,\n26). In the context of the entire book, however, one can understand\nher distanced feminism as another functional \u201coutsider\u201d to\nboth philosophy and architecture that, like all outsides, forces those\npositioned within the inside to really \u201cthink\u201d\n(2001, 64). In the example of her own work,\nGrosz claims that she had to move away from her earlier work on the\nbody (Grosz 1994) because she had \u201cworked to death\u201d the\ntopic. Moving to the field of architecture has allowed her to approach\nthe question of materiality in a fresh way (2001, 26). Making that\nmove, Grosz offers feminists an example of how to get some distance\nfrom and thus gain a new perspective on familiar feminist concepts so\nthat fresh insight into them is possible. Grosz thus provisionally\npreserves the distinctions between continental and pragmatist\nphilosophy, architecture, and feminism in order to enable the\n\u201cinfection by one side of the border of the other [and] a\nbecoming otherwise of each of the terms thus bounded\u201d (2001,\n65).\n",
