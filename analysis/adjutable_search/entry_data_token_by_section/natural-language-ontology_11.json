    "main_text": "Distinctive Features of the Ontology of Natural Language || The Mass-Count Distinction\n3.3 The Mass-Count Distinction\n\nThe mass-count distinction displays, in a particularly striking way, a\ndiscrepancy between the ontology displayed by natural language and the\nontology tied to cognition or what is generally taken to be the\nontology of the real. Various criteria distinguish count nouns from\nmass nouns in English. Most important is the availability of the\nplural and the applicability of cardinal and ordinal numerals with\ncount nouns, but not mass nouns (Pelletier & Schubert 1989/ 2003;\nDoetjes 2012). The mass-count distinction, it is generally agreed, has\nsemantic content, but there is much less agreement as to what that\ncontent amounts to (see entry on\n metaphysics of mass expressions).\n The mass-count distinction has often been taken to reflect the\nontological distinction between individuals (chair, door) and\nmatter or stuff (metal, wood), a distinction that has been\ncast either in terms of the notion of having a boundary or integrity\nor being an atom (with respect to some concept). However, more\nrecently linguists have drawn attention to a number of generalizations\nthat indicate that the distinction between singular count, mass, and\nplural nouns does not strictly go along with an ontological\ndistinction between different types of beings (Pelletier &\nSchubert 1989/2003; Chierchia 1998; Moltmann 1997; Rothstein 2017).\nFirst, singular count NPs seem to be able to stand for the very same\nthings as definite plural or mass NPs (the (loose) collection of\nstuff on this desk\u2014the stuff on this desk, the quantity of\nliquid in the container\u2014the liquid in the container).\nSecond, languages may make a choice of mass as opposed to count\nwithout apparent perceptual differences (rice\u2014oats,\ncorn\u2014peas, cattle\u2014cows). Also\ncross-linguistically, the choice of mass versus count for particular\nentities appears to an extent arbitrary (English\nhair\u2014Italian capelli, English\npasta\u2014French p\u00e2tes). Third, there is an\nimportant class of so-called object mass nouns, mass nouns that appear\nto stand for pluralities of well-individuated objects, such as\nhardware, jewelry, luggage, staff,\npolice force, often competing with apparent co-extensional\nplural nouns in the same language (clothes\u2014clothing,\npolicemen\u2014police force, cows\u2014cattle,\ncarpets\u2014carpeting). Yet like other mass nouns, object mass\nnouns resist numerals (* the three police force) as well as a\nrange of other predicates applicable to plurals (John listed the\nclothes / ??? the clothing, The policemen / ??\nthe police force are / is numerous). Whether a language\nchooses a singular count, plural, or mass noun appears to an extent\narbitrary; yet the choice between mass and count plays a role for the\napplicability of number-related predicates and quantifiers. The\nmass-count distinction thus displays a form of \u201cgrammaticized\nindividuation\u201d (Rothstein 2017), involving a language-driven\nnotion of unity that may diverge from the notion of unity that\npertains to cognition or what is taken to be the real structure of\nthings.\n",
