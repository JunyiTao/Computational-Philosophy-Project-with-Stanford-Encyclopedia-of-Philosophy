    "main_text": "Accommodation || Accommodating Presuppositions in Satisfaction Framework\n5.2 Accommodating Presuppositions in Satisfaction Framework\n\nLocal satisfaction is at the heart of dynamic theories of\npresupposition, but we\u2019ve already seen that it faces some empirical\nchallenges in accounting for conditionalized presuppositions.\nSpecifically, sometimes satisfaction theories generate weaker\nconditional presuppositions when intuitively the speaker is\npresupposing a stronger, unconditionalized presupposition. Geurts\n(1996,1999a) deems this \"The Proviso Problem,\" and the data\nsurrounding this problem has left quite a mess for proponents of\nsatisfaction theories to clean\n up.[22]\n\nAccording to satisfaction theories, only weak conditional\npresuppositions should follow from embedding presuppositions in\ncertain constructions, notably conditionals themselves. For example,\nimagine that you are about to go surfing for the first time in the\ncold waters of Northern California, and you and your interlocutor\nsuspect that a common acquaintance, Theo, is a scuba diver, and that\nhe may be able to help. In this context, the use of his in\n(38a) intuitively leads to the conditional inference in (38c):\n\n(38a)\nIf Theo is a scuba diver, then he will bring his wet suit.\n(38b)\nTheo has a wet suit.\n(38c)\nIf Theo is a scuba diver, then he has a wet suit.\n\n\nContrast this with (39a), which strongly suggests that the speaker\nbelieves that Theo has a wet suit (39b), and not the weaker\nconditional in (39c):\n\n(39a)\nIf Theo is in a generous mood, then he will bring his wet suit.\n(39b)\nTheo has a wet suit\n(39c)\nIf Theo is in a generous mood, then he has a wet suit.\n\n\nWhatever mechanism is used to determine what is accommodated, it must\nensure that sometimes conditional presuppositions are strengthened (to\nbecome unconditionalized), and sometimes they aren\u2019t. What examples\nlike (38) and (39) suggest is that this might be explained in terms of\nplausibility: it could be that the conditional in (39c) is\nstrengthened because it seems implausible that a speaker would be\nassuming that Theo\u2019s generosity was linked to his ownership of aquatic\nparaphernalia, whereas it seems more plausible that a speaker would\nsimply be assuming that Theo owned such equipment.\n\nSeveral proposals (e.g. Beaver 2001, Singh 2007, 2009; Schlenker 2011)\ntry to motivate this kind of strengthening mechanism to explain\nwhen\u00a0exactly a conditionalized presupposition should be\nstrengthened. For example, Beaver\u2019s model of accommodation, first\npublished in Beaver (1992) treats accommodation as a type of filtering\noperation. Beaver suggests that due to uncertainty about what the\nspeaker takes the common ground to be, the hearer has to entertain\nmultiple alternative context sets, with some ranking of which is the\nmost plausible. All these alternative contexts are updated\nsimultaneously. Accommodation is then what happens when the update is\nnot defined on what was previously considered to be the most plausible\ncontext, in which case the hearer drops that context from contention.\nWhat remains is a new set of contexts in which the most plausible one\nis a context that has been successfully updated.\n\nUnfortunately for this style of explanation of presupposition\nstrengthening, plausibility appears to have its limits. Consider the\ntwo examples in (40a,b). If we assume that a cleft \"it is X\nthat Y-ed\" presupposes an existential, roughly\n\"someone/something Y-ed\" then in a dynamic theory of\npresupposition (40b) will generate the same conditionalized\npresupposition as results from (40a), which involves the factive\n\"knows\", namely the conditional in (40c). However, there is a clear\ndifference in the inferences we would tend to draw from utterances of\n(40a) and (40b). Whereas (40a) licenses an inference only to the\nconditional presupposition in (40c), example (40b) leads to the\nstronger, unconditionalized presupposition in (40d). Under the\nassumptions we have made, namely that (40a) and (40b) generate exactly\nthe same underlying conditionalized presupposition, the plausibility\napproach used in Beaver\u2019s framework fails to predict a difference in\nwhat is accommodated in these cases.\n\n(40a)\nPeter knows that if the problem was easy, someone solved it.\n(40b)\nIf the problem was easy then it was Kristie who solved it.\n(40c)\nIf the problem was easy, someone solved it.\n    [Conditional presupposition for (40a,b), accommodated for (40a)]\n(40d)\nSomeone solved the problem.\n    [Unconditionalized presupposition, accommodated for (40b) but not\n    (40a)]\n\n\nOne relevant factor here that might influence accomodation is\ninformation structure. In (40b), the cleft structure might be said to\nreflect the presence of a Question Under Discussion (QUD), in\nthe sense of Roberts (2012), concerning who solved the problem. To the\nextent that such a question is under discussion, the interlocutors\nwill presumably know that this is so. And if \"Who solved the problem?\"\nis indeed the question the interlocutors are trying to answer, then\nthey are likely to mutually accept that someone solved the problem,\nthus explaining projection. Crucially, this line of reasoning depends\non the cleft in (40b) having a particular information structural\nfunction, and a similar argument could not be made in a case like\n(39a), where there is no constructional marking of information\nstructure, and in particular no indicator that \"Who solved the\nproblem?\" is the QUD.\n\n(41a)\nIf the problem was easy then Peter knows that someone solved it.\n(41b)\nIf the problem was easy then Peter KNOWS that someone solved it.\n(41c)\nIf the problem was easy then even PETER knows that someone solved it.\n\n\nWe may have reasonable motivations for when we might expect a\nconditional presupposition to be strengthened. But even with such\nmechanisms, satisfaction theories still fall short when confronting\ncertain data. For example, consider (42) below.\n\n(42)\nIf when Sam gets back from vacation he finds moldy fruit in the\nkitchen, he\u2019ll be annoyed that he had food in the house.\n\n\nHere, the consequent presupposes that Sam had food in the house, which\nis also entailed by the antecedent. Since satisfaction theories assume\nthat presuppositions in a complex sentence will be satisfied locally,\nwe\u2019re left with a tautology. So, the local satisfaction constraint\ngenerates presuppositions which are redundant.\n\nThe proviso problem is still a relevant hurdle for proponents of\nmodern satisfaction theories. Mandelkern (2016) presents a version of\nsatisfaction theory designed to avoid the proviso problem entirely.\nRomoli et al (2011) explore this issue experimentally by asking which\npresupposition -the conditional or unconditional option- is more\nbasic. But, ultimately the proviso problem is less problematic for\nother accounts of presupposition, which don\u2019t rely on local context\nupdates.\n",
