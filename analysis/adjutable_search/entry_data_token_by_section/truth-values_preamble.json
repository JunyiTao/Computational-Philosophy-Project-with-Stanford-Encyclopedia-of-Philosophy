    "main_text": "\n\nTruth values have been put to quite different uses in philosophy and\nlogic, being characterized, for example, as:\n\nprimitive abstract objects denoted by sentences in natural and\nformal languages, \nabstract entities hypostatized as the equivalence classes of\nsentences, \nwhat is aimed at in judgements, \nvalues indicating the degree of truth of sentences, \nentities that can be used to explain the vagueness of concepts,\n\nvalues that are preserved in valid inferences, \nvalues that convey information concerning a given\nproposition.\n\n\nDepending on their particular use, truth values have been treated as\nunanalyzed, as defined, as unstructured, or as structured\nentities.\n\nThe notion of a truth value has been explicitly introduced into logic\nand philosophy by Gottlob Frege\u2014for the first time in Frege\n1891, and most notably in his seminal paper (Frege 1892). Although it\nwas Frege who made the notion of a truth value to one of the central\nconcepts of semantics, the idea of special semantical values, however,\nwas anticipated by Boole and Peirce already, see the survey article on\na \u201chistory of truth values\u201d by B\u00e9ziau (2012).\nAccording to Kneale and Kneale (1962: 413), Boole\u2019s system\ncontains all that is needed for its interpretation \u201cin terms of\ntruth values of propositions\u201d, and as Church (1956: 17) remarks,\nthe \u201cexplicit use of two truth-values appears for the first time\nin a paper by C.S. Peirce in the American Journal of\nMathematics, vol. 7 (1885), pp. 180\u2013202\u201d. Frege\nconceived this notion as a natural component of his language analysis\nwhere sentences, being saturated expressions, are interpreted as a\nspecial kind of names, which refer to (denote, designate, signify) a\nspecial kind of objects: truth values. Moreover, there are, according\nto Frege, only two such objects: the True (das\nWahre) and the False (das Falsche):\n\nEvery assertoric sentence \u2026 is to be regarded as a proper name,\nand its Bedeutung, if it has one, is either the True or the\nFalse. (Frege 1892, trans. Beaney 1997: 158)\n\n\nThis new and revolutionary idea has had a far reaching and manifold\nimpact on the development of modern logic. It provides the means to\nuniformly complete the formal apparatus of a functional analysis of\nlanguage by generalizing the concept of a function and introducing a\nspecial kind of functions, namely propositional functions, or truth\nvalue functions, whose range of values consists of the set of truth\nvalues. Among the most typical representatives of propositional\nfunctions one finds predicate expressions and logical connectives. As\na result, one obtains a powerful tool for a conclusive implementation\nof the extensionality principle (also called the principle of\ncompositionality), according to which the meaning of a complex\nexpression is uniquely determined by the meanings of its components.\nOn this basis one can also discriminate between extensional and\nintensional contexts and advance further to the conception of\nintensional logics. Moreover, the idea of truth values has induced a\nradical rethinking of some central issues in the philosophy of logic,\nincluding: the categorial status of truth, the theory of abstract\nobjects, the subject-matter of logic and its ontological foundations,\nthe concept of a logical system, the nature of logical notions,\netc.\n\nIn the following, several important philosophical problems directly\nconnected to the notion of a truth value are considered and various\nuses of this notion are explained.\n",
