Science aims at the construction of true models of our\nreality. It is in this sense a semantical venture. In the 21-st\ncentury the process of theory formation and testing will for the\nlargest part be done automatically by computers working on large\ndatabases with observations. Turing award winner Jim Grey framed the\nemerging discipline of e-science as the fourth data-driven paradigm of\nscience. The others are empirical, theoretical and computational. As\nsuch the process of automatic theory construction on the basis of data\nis part of the methodology of science and consequently of philosophy\nof information (Adriaans & Zantinge 1996; Bell, Hey, & Szalay\n2009; Hey, Tansley, and Tolle 2009). Many well-known learning\nalgorithms, like decision tree induction, support vector machines,\nnormalized information distance and neural networks, use entropy based\ninformation measures to extract meaningful and useful models out of\nlarge data bases. The very name of the discipline Knowledge Discovery\nin Databases (KDD) is witness to the ambition of the Big Data research\nprogram. We quote:\n\n\nAt an abstract level, the KDD field is concerned with the development\nof methods and techniques for making sense of data. The basic problem\naddressed by the KDD process is one of mapping low-level data (which\nare typically too voluminous to understand and digest easily) into\nother forms that might be more compact (for example, a short report),\nmore abstract (for example, a descriptive approximation or model of\nthe process that generated the data), or more useful (for example, a\npredictive model for estimating the value of future cases). At the\ncore of the process is the application of specific data-mining methods\nfor pattern discovery and extraction. (Fayyad, Piatetsky-Shapiro,\n& Smyth 1996: 37)\n\n\nMuch of the current research focuses on the issue of selecting an\noptimal computational model for a data set. The theory of Kolmogorov\ncomplexity is an interesting methodological foundation to study\nlearning and theory construction as a form of data compression. The\nintuition is that the shortest theory that still explains the data is\nalso the best model for generalization of the observations. A crucial\ndistinction in this context is the one between one- and two-part\ncode optimization: \n\n\n\nOne-part Code Optimization: The methodological\naspects of the theory of Kolmogorov complexity become clear if we\nfollow its definition. We begin with a well-formed dataset y\nand select an appropriate universal machine \\(U_j\\). The expression\n\\(U_j(\\overline{T_i}x)= y\\) is a true sentence that gives us\ninformation about y. The first move in the development of a\ntheory of measurement is to force all expressiveness to the\ninstructional or procedural part of the sentence by a restriction to\nsentences that describe computations on empty input:  \n\\[U_j(\\overline{T_i}\\emptyset)= y\\]\n\n\nThis restriction is vital for the proof of invariance. From this, in\nprinciple infinite, class of sentences we can measure the length when\nrepresented as a program. We select the ones (there might be more than\none) of the form \\(\\overline{T_i}\\) that are shortest. The length\n\\(\\mathit{l}(\\overline{T_i})\\) of such a shortest description is a\nmeasure for the information content of y. It is asymptotic in\nthe sense that, when the data set y grows to an infinite\nlength, the information content assigned by the choice of another\nTuring machine will never vary by more than a constant in the limit.\nKolmogorov complexity measures the information content of a data set\nin terms of the shortest description of the set of instructions that\nproduces the data set on a universal computing device.\n\n\nTwo-part Code Optimization: Note that by restricting\nourselves to programs with empty input and the focus on the length\n of programs instead of their content we gain the\nquality of invariance for our measure, but we also lose a lot of\nexpressiveness. The information in the actual program that produces\nthe data set is neglected. Subsequent research therefore has focused\non techniques to make the explanatory power, hidden in the Kolmogorov\ncomplexity measure, explicit. \n\n\nA possible approach is suggested by an interpretation of Bayes\u2019\nlaw. If we combine Shannon\u2019s notion of an optimal code with\nBayes\u2019 law, we get a rough theory about optimal model selection.\nLet \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) be a set of hypotheses and let x be a data\nset. Using Bayes\u2019 law, the optimal computational model under\nthis distribution would be:  \n\\[\\begin{equation}\nM_{\\textit{map}}(x) = \\textit{argmax}_{M \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\frac{P(M) P(x\\mid M)}{P(x)} \n\\end{equation} \\]\n\n\nThis is equivalent to optimizing:  \n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\\label{OptimalIbE} \\textit{argmin}_{M \\in \\mathcal{H}} - \\log P(M) - \\log P(x\\mid M) \\end{equation}\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(-\\log P(M)\\) can be interpreted as the length of the optimal\nmodel code in Shannon\u2019s sense and \\(- \\log P(x\\mid M)\\)\nas the length of the optimal data-to-model code; i.e., the\ndata interpreted with help of the model. This insight is canonized in\nthe so-called:\n\nMinimum Description Length (MDL) Principle: The best\ntheory to explain a data set is the one that minimizes the sum in bits\nof a description of the theory (model code) and of the data set\nencoded with the theory (the data to model code). \n\nThe MDL principle is often referred to as a modern version of\nOckham\u2019s razor (see entry on\n William of Ockham),\n although in its original form Ockham\u2019s razor is an ontological\nprinciple and has little to do with data compression (Long 2019). In\nmany cases MDL is a valid heuristic tool and the mathematical\nproperties of the theory have been studied extensively (Gr\u00fcnwald\n2007). Still MDL, Ockham\u2019s razor and two-part code optimization\nhave been the subject of considerable debate in the past decennia\n(e.g., Domingos 1998; McAllister 2003). \n\nThe philosophical implications of the work initiated by Solomonoff,\nKolmogorov and Chaitin in the sixties of the 20-th century are\nfundamental and diverse. The universal distribution m proposed\nby Solomonoff, for instance, codifies all possible mathematical\nknowledge and when updated on the basis of empirical observations\nwould in principle converge to an optimal scientific model of our\nworld. In this sense the choice of a universal Turing machine as basis\nfor our theory of information measurement has philosophical\nimportance, specifically for methodology of science. A choice for a\nuniversal Turing machine can be seen as a choice of a set of\nbias for our methodology. There are roughly two schools:\n\nPoor machine: choose a small universal Turing\nmachine. If the machine is small it is also general and universal,\nsince there is no room to encode any bias in to the machine. Moreover\na restriction to small machines gives small overhead when emulating\none machine on the other so the version of Kolmogorov complexity you\nget gives a measurement with a smaller asymptotic margin. Hutter\nexplicitly defends the choice of \u201cnatural\u201d small machines\n(Hutter 2005; Rathmanner & Hutter 2011), but also Li and\nVit\u00e1nyi (2019) seem to suggest the use of small models. \nRich machine: choose a big machine that\nexplicitly reflects what you already know about the world. For\nSolomonoff, the inventor of algorithmic complexity, the choice of a\nuniversal Turing machine is the choice for a universal prior. He\ndefends an evolutionary approach to learning in which an agent\nconstantly adapts the prior to what he already has discovered. The\nselection of your reference Turing machine uniquely characterizes your\na priori information (Solomonoff 1997). \n\n\nBoth approaches have their value. For rigid mathematical proofs the\npoor machine approach is often best. For practical applications on\nfinite data sets the rich model strategy often gets much better\nresults, since a poor machine would have to \u201cre-invent the\nwheel\u201d every time it compresses a data set. This leads to the\nconclusion that Kolmogorov complexity inherently contains a theory\nabout scientific bias and as such implies a methodology in which the\nclass of admissible universal models should be explicitly formulated\nand motivated a priori. In the past decennia there have been\na number of proposals to define a formal unit of measurement of the\namount of structural (or model-) information in a data set.\n\nAesthetic measure (Birkhoff 1950)\nSophistication (Koppel 1987; Antunes et al. 2006; Antunes &\nFortnow 2003)\nLogical Depth (Bennet 1988)\nEffective complexity (Gell-Mann, Lloyd 2003)\nMeaningful Information (Vit\u00e1nyi 2006)\nSelf-dissimilarity (Wolpert & Macready 2007)\nComputational Depth (Antunes et al. 2006)\nFacticity (Adriaans 2008)\n\n\nThree intuitions dominate the research. A string is\n\u201cinteresting\u201d when \u2026 \n\na certain amount of computation is involved in its creation\n(Sophistication, Computational Depth);\nthere is a balance between the model-code and the data-code under\ntwo-part code optimization (effective complexity, facticity);\nit has internal phase transitions (self-dissimilarity).\n\n\nSuch models penalize both maximal entropy and low information content.\nThe exact relationship between these intuitions is unclear. The\nproblem of meaningful information has been researched extensively in\nthe past years, but the ambition to formulate a universal method for\nmodel selection based on compression techniques seems to be misguided:\n\n\nObservation: A measure of meaningful information based on\ntwo-part code optimization can never be invariant in the\nsense of Kolmogorov complexity (Bloem et al. 2015, Adriaans 2020).\n\n\nThis appears to be the case even if we restrict ourselves to weaker\ncomputational models like total functions, but more research is\nnecessary. There seems to be no a priori mathematical\njustification for the approach, although two-part code optimization\ncontinues to be a valid approach in an empirical setting of data sets\nthat have been created on the basis of repeated observations.\nPhenomena that might be related to a theory of structural information\nand that currently are ill-understood are: phase transitions in the\nhardness of satisfiability problems related to their complexity (Simon\n& Dubois 1989; Crawford & Auton 1993) and phase transitions in\nthe expressiveness of Turing machines related to their complexity\n(Crutchfield & Young 1989, 1990; Langton 1990; Dufort &\nLumsden 1994). \n",
