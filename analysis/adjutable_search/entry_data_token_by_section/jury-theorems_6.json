    "main_text": "Three Jury Theorems || The fundamental tension between independence and competence\n2.4 The fundamental tension between independence and competence\n\nOne might have hoped that the \u201cconditional\u201d premises CI\nand CC are jointly justified for at least some\nconditionalisation, i.e., some suitably designed facts\nvariable \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Then the Conditional Jury Theorem would rest\non justified premises, and we could trust its conclusions. But a\ndilemma arises:\n\nConditional Independence is only plausible if one packs many facts\ninto \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (ideally all common causes).\nConditional Competence is only plausible if one packs few facts\ninto \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (ideally no facts, so that CC reduces to\nUC, the maximally plausible instance of CC).\n\n\nTherefore, CI and CC require different conditionalisations. They are\nalmost never justified jointly, but only justified\nindividually, for different facts variables \\(\\mathbf{x}\\)\n(Dietrich 2008). This is the fundamental tension between independence\nand competence. This tension lies not in a logical contradiction\nbetween both, but in the nature of realistic decision problems (for a\npotential exception, see\n Section 4.3).\n\nWhy does this tension exist? Formal theorizing aside, it is obvious\nthat whether someone is competent\u2014i.e., more often right than\nwrong\u2014depends on the type (reference class) of judgment tasks\nconsidered. Plausibly, people are more often right among all\nconceivable judgment tasks (the maximal reference class), and\npresumably also among many large reference classes, such as all\nguilty-or-innocent judgment tasks. But someone is presumably\nincompetent\u2014more often wrong\u2014among some very specific\ntypes of judgment tasks, such as all confusing tasks, and all\nguilty-or-innocent judgment tasks with seemingly honest but lying\nwitnesses.\n\nEach instance \\(x\\) of the facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) defines a type\n(reference class) of tasks: those tasks in which the facts are \\(x\\).\nSome instances of the facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) make it easy to form\ncorrect judgments: instances \\(x\\) where the evidence is transparent,\nwitnesses are honest, laboratory tests are correct, etc. Here\nindividuals \\(i\\) are competent: \\(P(R_{i}|x)>\\frac{1}{2}\\).\nPerhaps some other instances of the facts \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) make it hard\nto form correct judgments: instances \\(x\\) with misleading evidence,\netc. Here voters are not competent: \\(P(R_{i}|x)\\leq\\frac{1}{2}\\).\nWhether misleading instances exist\u2014i.e., whether CC\nfails\u2014depends on the facts variable \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) used. If all\ncommon causes are packed into \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (presumably to ensure\nConditional Independence CI), then almost inevitably certain instances\n\\(x\\) of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) represent misleading circumstances, in which\nvoters \\(i\\) have low competence \\(P(R_{i}|x)<\\frac{1}{2}\\).\nIronically, if one packs much less information into the facts\n\\(\\mathbf{x}\\), possibly even reducing \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) to the state\n(often a variable with just two instances), then one may well\nrehabilitate Conditional Competence, whilst sacrificing Conditional\nIndependence. This is the dilemma.\n",
