    "main_text": "The Star of Redemption || Part I\n3.2 Part I\n\n\nRosenzweig begins the Star with a reflection on human\nmortality, and his consideration of the irreducible uniqueness of the\nindividual revealed in death precipitates the break-up of the\n\u201cAll\u201d, which philosophy has long claimed to know, into what\nRosenzweig takes to be the three fundamental\u2014and fundamentally\nindependent\u2014kinds of beings: God, world, and self. Moreover,\nthe insights Rosenzweig draws from the human fear of death in the\nopening pages of the Star serve to direct him in his own quest\nfor knowledge of the \u201ctrue All\u201d that has eluded the\n\u201cold thinking\u201d of the philosophical tradition. The most\nimportant of these insights are the following:\n\n\nRosenzweig locates in the fear of death the source of the\nawareness of the basic split between selfhood and worldliness which\nhad perplexed him at least since his university years. In the fear of\ndeath, Rosenzweig claims, in the opening paragraphs of\nthe Star, the human being experiences her own \u201ctornness\nfrom the whole world\u201d. She is confronted with the fact that her\n\u201cI would be an \u2018it\u2019\u201d if she died. As\nthe Star proceeds along its course, Rosenzweig will both\noffer an account of this split the human being experiences, and show\nhow the reconciliation of selfhood and worldliness will only come with\nthe completion of the \u201cAll\u201d in redemption.\n\nIn serious contemplation of death, Rosenzweig suggests, one\nexperiences nothingness in a particular, and particularly\nimmediate fashion. The human being is set \u201cface-to-face with the\nNothing\u201d in the fear of death. Death shows the human being the\n\u201cunthinkable annihilation\n[Vernichtung\u2014i.e., the\nmaking-into-Nothing, or nothing-ing]\u201d of her\n\u201cI\u201d. The fear of death thus compels the human being to\nrecognize the extent to which her self or \u201cI\u201d is not at\nall securely self-grounded or absolute, but rather is ever suspended\nin nothingness. Moreover, Rosenzweig devotes considerable attention to\nthe particular quality of the nothingness experienced in the\nfear of death. I do not experience nothingness as a universal or\nabsolute state in the fear of death, Rosenzweig suggests, but rather I\nexperience my nothingness\u2014I experience nothingness as\na particular \u201csomething\u201d that threatens me and me\nalone.\n\n\n\nThe particularity of nothingness over which the human being hovers\nin the fear of death leads Rosenzweig to critique the starting points\nof the systems of German Idealism and to suggest his own alternative to\nthem. German Idealist systems\u2014and here Rosenzweig alludes to\nvarious sources in the writings of Schelling and Hegel\u2014conceive\nof the absolute ground of \u201cthe All\u201d as an undifferentiated,\n\u201corphic unity,\u201d out of which the differentiated reality we\nexperience unfolds dialectically. Armed with the particular character\nof nothingness drawn from the experience of the fear of death,\nRosenzweig suggests that the German Idealists \u201cpresuppose\u201d\nthe undifferentiated, universal character of the Absolute, as the\norigin of the \u201cAll,\u201d and they thereby mistakenly root the\nmyriad particular beings we experience in actuality in an original\nunity (i.e., an absolute or universal \u201cnothing\u201d). However,\nRosenzweig reasons, particulars that are ultimately the dialectical\nproduct of absolute unity cannot be said to be particulars at\nall. And thus the systems of German Idealism do not in fact attain or\narticulate knowledge of the identity and difference of\n\u201cAll\u201d that is; rather, they reduce the unique\ndifference inherent to the different kinds of particular beings to a\ncommon unity.\n\n\nThe particularity of nothingness experienced in the fear of death thus\nleads Rosenzweig to take up a starting point in difference. Every\nparticular kind of being must be taken up as derived from its own\nparticular nothing, rather than as rooted ultimately in a common\nunity.  Censuring the tendency of the philosophical tradition, once\nagain, to reduce the three domains of special metaphysics one to the\nother\u2014to reduce selfhood and world to manifestations of the\ndivine, or the divine and the self to aspects of the cosmos, or the\ndivine and the external world to products of the human\nmind\u2014Rosenzweig takes up each of these three different kinds of\nbeings as having generated itself out of its own particular\nnothing.\n\n\nTaking its lead from the particularity of nothing revealed in the\nfear of death, the first part of the Star thus begins by\nconstructing the particular respective being of God, world, and self\neach out of its own particular nothing. While Rosenzweig insists on the\nfundamentally independent natures of these kinds of being, the method\nby which he traces each\u2019s self-generation out of its particular\nnothing is the same. God, world, and self each emerges as an\nelement in Rosenzweig\u2019s system through a process in\nwhich Rosenzweig depicts two paths leading out of each particular\nnothing and arriving at a point of unity. The two paths that Rosenzweig\ntraces out of each particular nothing are as follows: 1) the path from\nout of the particular nothing driven by the affirmation of\nwhat is \u201cnot-nothing.\u201d Rosenzweig identifies this path as\nthe path of the \u201cYes.\u201d 2) the path from out of the\nparticular nothing driven by the negation of that very\nnothing. Rosenzweig identifies this path as that of the\n\u201cNo.\u201d These two paths then come to a unity in what\nRosenzweig refers to as the \u201cAnd\u201d of \u201cYes\u201d and\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\nRosenzweig claims that he models his method for constructing the\nelements of the Star on the mathematical notion of a\ndifferential. (The differential models for Rosenzweig the possibility\nof generating something from nothing\u2014when that nothing is a\ndeterminate nothing, rather than a nothing conceived as absolute.) But\nin order to make sense of what Rosenzweig aims to achieve through his\nconstructions of the elemental God, world, and self in the first part\nof the Star, it is helpful to consider the kinds of qualities\nRosenzweig identifies with the affirmative and negative paths,\nrespectively, which emerge out of each particular nothing and merge\ntogether in each respective element. In Rosenzweig\u2019s\nconstruction, the affirmation of what is not-nothing within each\nelement (\u201cYes\u201d) always corresponds to a certain quality of\n\u201csubstantiality\u201d or \u201cbeing\u201d attributed to that\nelement, while the negation of nothing within each element\n(\u201cNo\u201d) always corresponds to an \u201cactive\u201d\nquality attributed to the element. Thus it is infinite being (Yes) and\nfreedom (No) which fuse together in the self-generation of the\nelemental God; the presence of logos (Yes) and the vital plenitude of\nparticulars (No) that fuse together to form the elemental world;\nenduring character (Yes) and free will (No) that unite within the\nelemental self.\n\n\nIf thus Hegel famously insisted that truth be grasped \u201cnot only\nas substance, but equally as subject,\u201d Rosenzweig asserts that\nthe realization of this same kind of identity of substantiality and\nactivity is necessary to allow each of the elements to generate itself\nout of its nothing. Rosenzweig in fact devotes considerable time over\nthe course of the first part of the Star to demonstrating\nthat only those beings which construct themselves out of the\nunification of the dual paths of substantiality and activity, of\n\u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo,\u201d can hold themselves out of\ntheir respective nothings. Rosenzweig sees in this two-poled structure\nof each being its inherent \u201cfactuality.\u201d Indeed, he\nhighlights the way the German word for fact\nitself\u2014Tatsache\u2014brings together \u201cact\u201d\n(Tat) and \u201csubstantiality\u201d or\n\u201cmatter\u201d (Sache). Rosenzweig writes, \u201cNot\nthe substance [Sache], not the act [Tat], only the\nfact [Tatsache] is secure from falling back into the\nnothing,\u201d thereby indicating that only by emerging as the fusion\nof an active and substantial pole, can God, world, and the self gain a\nstanding in being each over against its respective nothing.\n\n\nThus eschewing the tendency of the philosophical tradition to root\nall beings in a single, unconditioned ground, Rosenzweig begins the\nStar by showing how all particular beings\u2014divine,\nworldly, personal\u2014can be understood as generating themselves\neach out of its own particular nothing. But throughout the first part\nof the Star, these constructions of the elemental God, world,\nand self remain \u201chypothetical.\u201d Rosenzweig suggests that\none only attains \u201ccertainty\u201d regarding these constructions\nwhen they are shown to be the necessary conditions for the actuality we\nexperience. As Rosenzweig proceeds to argue, in the second part of the\nStar, the actuality we experience is born of the\nrelations between God, world, and selves. That is to\nsay, the actuality we experience is not to be understood as rooted in\nan original metaphysical unity, but rather in the relations between\nparticulars each of which generates itself out of its own nothing.\nMoreover, Rosenzweig proceeds to show that in entering into the\nreciprocal relations with one another which ground our experience,\nelemental beings take steps towards the ultimate systematic unification\nof the \u201cAll\u201d.\n",
