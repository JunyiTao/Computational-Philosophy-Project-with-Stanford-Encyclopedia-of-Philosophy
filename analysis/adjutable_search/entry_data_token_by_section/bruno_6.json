    "main_text": "Religion\n7. Religion\n\nMarsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (in one phase of his\ncareer) and other Renaissance authors had held similarly\n\u201cPelagian\u201d views that philosophy led to self-perfection\nand \u201cdeification\u201d. Yet they had stopped well short of\ndenying the integrity of Christianity. Philosophy and religion were,\nso to speak, two parallel paths, suited to different audiences. Bruno\nhad no such scruples. Philosophy\u2014Bruno\u2019s philosophy of God\nas immanent in an infinite universe as announced in The Ash\nWednesday Supper\u2014was the true bread of life. It\n\u201cilluminated the blind\u201d, \u201cloosed the tongue of the\ndumb\u201d, \u201ccured the lame\u201d, so that the human spirit\ncould once again \u201cprogress\u201d (BOI I, 454). Its powers, that\nis, were miraculous, Christ-like, salvific. By contrast, Christianity\nwas fraudulent. Under a thin veil of irony, all the while denying the\nirony, Bruno praised the various guises under which Christianity\ntaught that ignorance of the natural world led the soul to God. Among\nits many deceits were: scriptural injunctions to acknowledge our\nignorance, notably, the Pauline theme of folly; the ascetic mysticism\nof Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and mystics generally; claims that\nthe light of faith and revelation were superior to human knowledge;\nAugustine\u2019s emphasis on the fallen nature of mankind,\nparticularly the corruption of knowledge innate to it; injunctions to\nbe childlike and meek; and the humility and obedience that the\nChristian clergy sought to instill among its flock (BOI II,\n381\u2013384, 415, 418, 422\u2013430, 443\u2013448; BOL I.2,\n316). The philosopher should ignore these \u201cfoolish dreams\u201d\n(BOL I.3, 200)\u2014in practical as well as in intellectual\nendeavor. To be virtuous was to strive against adversity, to embody a\ncoincidence of opposites. \u201cWhere opposites meet, there is order,\nthere resides virtue\u201d (BOI II, 549). Who deserved praise the\nmore: someone who healed a worthless cripple, or a man who liberated\nhis homeland or who reformed, not a mere body, but a mind (BOI II,\n264\u2013267)? In other words, who was the true savior: Christ or\nBruno?\n\nSimultaneously, with the same indignation that Spinoza and Nietzsche\nwould later voice, Bruno impugned the clerical caste. Living\nparasitically off the labors of others and affecting \u201ca\nfoul-smelling melancholy\u201d, i.e., accidia (BOL\nII.2,189\u2013190; BOI II, 238\u2013239), they advocated the\nsolitary life and renunciation of this world for the next. Such men\nhad extinguished the divine light that had made the souls of the\nancients \u201cheroic and divine\u201d, those very men whom they\ncondemned for their pride (BOI I, 453). If we followed the counsel of\nthese clerics, we would have no temples, no chapels, no hospices, no\nhospitals, no colleges, no universities (BOI II, 238, 267). Of all\npeoples, the ancient Romans had best understood the value of\n\u201cglory\u201d for establishing and maintaining civilization. A\ntrue religion, like that of the ancients, extolled men of action,\nstrength of body and mind and worldly glory (BOI II,\n267\u2013268). Similar comments on clerical duplicity, glory and\nreligion occur in Machiavelli, whose works Bruno probably read.\n\nNevertheless, religion had a role to play. The \u201cuneducated\npopulace\u201d (BOI I, 525; II, 514\u2013515) could not aspire to philosophical\nperfection. They needed laws and sanctions to keep their conduct in\ncheck. Religion, with its promises of reward and punishment in an\nafterlife, served this purpose. When Moses had led the Israelites from\ncaptivity, they were no more than an uneducated rabble. To govern\nthem, he established laws and enforced them with terrifying accounts\nof an almighty, wrathful God who administered retribution in an\nafterlife. Scripture, whether Jewish, Islamic or Christian, had been\ncomposed with this practical goal in mind (BOI I, 522\u2013528). Admittedly, Bruno conceded,\nScripture did sometimes record philosophical truths. Genesis and the\nBook of Job were conspicuous repositories. This was only to be\nexpected, given that Scripture was a tributary of \u201cthe ancient\nphilosophy\u201d (see\n Section 2).\nFor the most part, however, it simplified. Several passages of\nScripture (e.g., Ecclesiastes, 1:5\u20136; Joshua 10:12\u201313)\nimplied that the sun circled the motionless earth. This was a\nsimplification made for the benefit of the uneducated. Disquisitions\nbased on a true, heliocentric, interpretation of celestial motion\nwould have, at best, confused them and, at worst, led them,\ncounterproductively, to dismiss Scripture\u2019s tales of divine\nretribution (BOI I, 522\u2013525).\n\nTo claim that Scripture made allowances for the weak understanding of\nmost men and women was conventional. Patristic, Catholic and\nProtestant theologians acknowledged that Moses had addressed an\nignorant, slavish people and that Scripture spoke in a way that the\nuneducated could understand. All agreed, too, that it focused on moral\nand spiritual issues and refrained from intricate philosophical\narguments. Bruno\u2019s appeal to these positions disguised his\nheterodoxy. The crucial deviation was his denial of miracles, the most\nimportant of all testimonies to the Christian faith. Given that the\nlaws of nature were, essentially, \u201cGod in things\u201d, they\nwere inviolable (BOL I.2, 316). Repeatedly Bruno mocked, allusively,\nthe miracles reported in the Old and New Testament, including those\nperformed by Moses and Christ. Christ\u2019s were bagatelle,\n\u201csleights of hand\u201d (BOI II, 383). They were no\nmore than natural magic, effects produced by manipulating\n\u201coccult\u201d, that is, natural, though imperceptible, forces (BOL III, 427).\nOr, indeed, they may have been the fruits of demonic magic, a comment\nwhich implied that Christ had commerce with demons. Christ began to\nperform miracles, Bruno noted, only \u201cafter his struggle with the\ndevil in the desert\u201d (BOL II.2, 181). The allusive style in\nwhich Bruno disguised his views only served to accentuate his\nblasphemies, mixing as they did ridicule and contempt with heresy.\nHandwritten annotations in copies of his works show that\ncontemporaries or near contemporaries recognized his intentions easily\nenough.\n\nPhilosophers, \u201cheroes\u201d, did not need Scripture\u2019s\nbogus threats of retribution and promises of future rewards to cajole\nthem into behaving morally. They understood the \u201cpattern\u201d\n(istoria) of Nature inscribed within [them]\u2019 (BOI II,\n24\u201325), that God, in other words, was with and within them (BOI\nI, 455\u2013456; II, 658), and governed their actions\naccordingly. Those who considered the matter carefully, \u201ctruly\nreligious men\u201d, \u201cmen who were good by nature\u201d, would\nsee that Bruno\u2019s philosophy, more than any other, \u201cnot\nonly contained the truth but also favoured religion\u201d (BOI I,\n528). They did not need rituals involving some \u201cfood and\ndrink\u201d to revere the divine (BOL I.1, 205). On diverse\noccasions, he covertly mocked the eucharist, despising as he did the\n\u201csubtleties\u201d of scholastic accounts of transubstantiation\n(Spampanato 1933, 40). Instead, it was the majesty of Nature, the\ninfinite animate universe, that inspired the wonder and reverence of\ntruly divine men and led them to search for its cause (see\n Section 5).  In so doing they became\nthemselves \u201cgreater than those gods whom blind commoners\nworship\u201d (BOI II, 24). Stripped, in short, of its false claims,\nChristianity could be seen for what it was, a \u201cfoolish faith and\nblind credulity\u201d (BOI II, 386, 398), \u201ca wretched\nstory\u201d (BOL I.2, 172), \u201ca worthless, pernicious\nfable\u201d (BOI II, 400), a continuation of Judaism, a religion\ninvented by that \u201cpestilent, leprous and wholly\npernicious\u201d race, the Jews (BOI II, 314\u2013315; for similar\nstereotypical anti-Jewish comments, see Section\n2 and the caveat there regarding the extent to which they reflect\nBruno\u2019s views). With its threats that the world would end and\nits stories of a God who wrought miracles at whim, it had cowed a\n\u201cstupefied\u201d world into despising Nature\u2014\u201cGod\nin things\u201d\u2014and, \u201chaving smashed the tables of\nNature\u201d (cf. Exodus, 32:19), looked forward joyfully to the ruin\nof all things (BOL I.2 123).\n\nBruno\u2019s several clashes with ecclesiastical authorities testify\nto his impatience with Christianity of whatever shade. The sectarian\nviolence that plagued the sixteenth century plainly showed that it had\ndone the very opposite of what religion should do, \u201cbind\u201d\nmen and women together, an allusion to an etymological derivation of\nthe Latin word religio from religo, \u201cI\nbind\u201d, commonly invoked by Latin authors of all periods (BOL\nII.2, 181). There are, however, many indications that Bruno found\nProtestantism the more irksome variant. Above all Protestants\u2019\ndenial of the efficacy of \u201cgood works\u201d and free will and,\nconversely, their emphasis on the inner spirit, predestination and\njustification through \u201cfaith alone\u201d, were unconducive to\ncivil order, political stability and material prosperity. At several\npoints Bruno\u2019s turn of phrase suggests that his attack on\nProtestant theology was directed in the first instance against\nLuther\u2019s On the Bondage of the Will (1525) and that, in\nformulating his riposte, he drew on Erasmus\u2019s On Free\nWill (1524), the work that had prompted Luther to write his\ntreatise in the first place.\n",
