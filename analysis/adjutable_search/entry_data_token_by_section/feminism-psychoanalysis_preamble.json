    "main_text": "\n\nThis article will discuss psychoanalytic feminism, not feminist\npsychoanalysis (i.e., except indirectly, it will not address ideas\nabout developing feminist principles in clinical practice, although\nmost of the authors discussed below are trained analysts).\nPsychoanalysis develops a theory of the unconscious that links\nsexuality and subjectivity ineluctably together. In doing so, it\ndiscloses the ways in which our sense of self, and our political\nloyalties and attachments, are influenced by unconscious drives and\nordered by symbolic structures that are beyond the purview of\nindividual agency. It might appear at the outset that any alliance\nbetween feminism and psychoanalysis would have to be coordinated on\ntreacherous ground: in Sigmund Freud\u2019s lecture on\n\u201cFemininity,\u201d for instance, while discussing the\n\u201criddle of femininity\u201d (Freud 1933 [1968: 116]) or of\nsexual differentiation, Freud\u2019s rhetoric impeaches women as\n\u201cthe problem\u201d (1933 [1968: 113]) and excuses members of\nhis audience from this indictment by offering the hope that they are\n\u201cmore masculine than feminine\u201d (1933 [1968: 117]). Many\nfeminists have outlined biases toward women contained in\nFreud\u2019s oratory and of the overt content of his claims. This\narticle will explain how and why feminist theory has, nonetheless,\nundertaken a serious reading of Freud and developed careful analyses\nof his fundamental concepts, working out their limits, impasses, and\npossibilities.\n\nIn \u201cFemininity,\u201d Freud writes that \u201cpsychoanalysis\ndoes not try to describe what a woman is\u2014that would be a task it\ncould scarcely perform\u2014but sets about enquiring how she comes\ninto being, how a woman develops out of a child with a bisexual\ndisposition\u201d (Freud 1933 [1968: 116]). In using the term\n\u2018bisexual,\u2019 Freud refers to a quality of the sexual\ninstinct, not a relation to a sexual object (which would be denoted by\nthe term \u2018inversion\u2019); the bisexual child is one who\npsychically is not yet either a man or a woman, whose instinctual life\nfunctions prior to sexual difference. Freud here portrays\nfemininity as one trajectory of the Oedipal Complex and indicates that\nsexed identity is a fragile achievement rather than a natural given or\nessence. By circumscribing the terrain on which the psychoanalytic\naccount of sexual difference moves, and by seeing unresolved, even\nunresolvable, riddles where others might see the work of nature or\nculture, Freud problematizes any causal, seamless, or direct tie\nbetween sex, sexuality, and sexual difference. Psychoanalytic inquiry\ndoes not fit comfortably with, and even unsettles, biological theories\nof sex and sociological theories of gender, thus also complicating the\nsex/gender distinction as it has often been formulated in feminist\ndebates. While sex and gender are sometimes construed in feminist\ntheory in terms of the contrast between biology and culture, or nature\nand nurture, Freud\u2019s theory, as discussed below, challenges\nthese dualisms, developing an account of the sexual drive that\ntraverses the mental and the physical, and undergoes idiosyncratic\nvicissitudes rather than assuming a uniform anatomical or social\nshape. Whatever the hazards of Freud\u2019s writings on women, then,\nhis work explores in new ways the meaning and possibilities of sexed\nidentity. Likewise, as I will argue below, psychoanalytic feminism\ninterrupts many assumptions about what feminism is and the conceptual\nand material objects it theorizes, including especially the very\nconcept of woman. In unsettling our understanding of this\nconcept, psychoanalysis also poses questions to feminism about the\nvalue of difference and the quest for equality, and the unresolved\ntensions between these divergent pursuits.\n\nWhile there is no doubt a vast ouvre of disparate positions\nthat might fall within the framework of psychoanalytic feminism, what\nis shared in common is a descent from, respect for, and some minimal\nborrowing of Freudian accounts of the unconscious, even while\ncriticizing and/or revising his theoretical apparatus. Any properly\npsychoanalytic theory must at the least offer an account of the\nunconscious and its relation to libido (the sex drive) and the death\ndrive. Precisely this descent, however, has also provided a\nbarrier to feminist deployment since Freud is sometimes read, at least\nsuperficially, as proffering misogynist, and perhaps Procrustean,\nelaborations of psychic structuration, curtailing and diminishing the\ndiversity of individual women\u2019s experiences into a restricted\nand unvarying formula that will fit within its own theoretical\nparameters. Nevertheless, Freud\u2019s reflections and hypotheses\nconcerning hysteria, the Oedipal Complex, female sexuality and\nfemininity, and women\u2019s role in civilization, among other ideas,\nhave provided the volatile grounds, the sites of contention, for\nfeminist re-articulation. Before any of the multiple and divergent\narticulations of psychoanalytic feminism can be discussed in more\ndetail, we must thus first establish their historical roots and the\nconceptual terrain on which they arise. Since a great deal of\npsychoanalytic feminist theory is specifically concerned with revising\nthe Oedipal narrative of Freud, this article will devote particular\nattention to Freud\u2019s theories of the unconscious as they pertain\nto the Oedipal Complex.\n",
