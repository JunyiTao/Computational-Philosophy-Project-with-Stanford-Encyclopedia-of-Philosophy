    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nKurt G\u00f6del was born on April 28, 1906 in what was then the\nAustro-Hungarian city of Br\u00fcnn, and what is now Brno in the Czech\nRepublic.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s father Rudolf August was a businessman, and his\nmother Marianne was a well-educated and cultured woman to whom\nG\u00f6del remained close throughout his life, as witnessed by the\nlong and wide-ranging correspondence between them. The family was well\noff, and G\u00f6del\u2019s childhood was an uneventful one, with one\nimportant exception; namely, from about the age of four G\u00f6del\nsuffered frequent episodes of poor health, and the health problems he\nsuffered then as well as others of various kinds were to plague him\nhis entire life.\n\nHealth problems notwithstanding, G\u00f6del proved to be an exemplary\nstudent at primary school and later the Gymnasium, excelling\nespecially in mathematics, languages and religion. Upon his graduation\nfrom the Gymnasium in Brno in 1924 G\u00f6del enrolled in the\nUniversity of Vienna, attending lectures on physics, his initial field\nof interest, lectures on philosophy given by Heinrich Gomperz, and\nlectures on mathematics. G\u00f6del took a number of physics courses\nduring his undergraduate years, as witnessed by his university\ntranscript; this is notable in view of G\u00f6del\u2019s subsequent\ncontributions to relativity in 1947. Philipp Furtw\u00e4ngler, cousin\nof the great German conductor Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, was one of his\nmathematics professors, and indeed Furtw\u00e4ngler\u2019s course on\nclass field theory almost tempted G\u00f6del to pursue his studies in\nthat area. G\u00f6del learned his logic from Rudolph Carnap and from\nHans Hahn, eventually graduating under Hahn with a Dr.phil. in\nmathematics in 1929. The main theorem of his dissertation was the\ncompleteness theorem for first order logic (G\u00f6del\n 1929).[2]\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s university years also marked the beginning of his\nattendance at meetings of the Vienna Circle, a group around Moritz\nSchlick that quickly became known as \u201clogical\npositivists,\u201d a term coined by Feigl and Blumberg in their 1931\n\u201cLogical positivism: A new movement in European\nphilosophy\u201d (Feigl and Blumberg 1931). Though G\u00f6del was not\nhimself a logical positivist, those discussions were a crucial\nformative influence.\n\nThe 1930s were a prodigious decade for G\u00f6del. After publishing\nhis 1929 dissertation in 1930, he published his groundbreaking\nincompleteness theorems in 1931, on the basis of which he was granted\nhis Habilitation in 1932 and a Privatdozentur at the University of\nVienna in 1933.\n\nAmong his mathematical achievements at the decade\u2019s close is the\nproof of the consistency of both the Axiom of Choice and\nCantor\u2019s Continuum Hypothesis with the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms\nfor set theory, obtained in 1935 and 1937, respectively. G\u00f6del\nalso published a number of significant papers on modal and\nintuitionistic logic and arithmetic during this period, principal\namong which is his \u201cOn intuitionistic arithmetic and number\ntheory,\u201d (G\u00f6del 1933e), in which he showed that classical\nfirst order arithmetic is interpretable in Heyting arithmetic by a\nsimple translation. Other publications of the 1930s include those on\nthe decision problem for the predicate calculus, on the length of\nproofs, and on differential and projective geometry.\n\nBy the end of the decade both G\u00f6del\u2019s advisor Hans Hahn and\nMoritz Schlick had died (the latter was assassinated by an\nex-student), two events which led to a personal crisis for G\u00f6del.\nAlso, his appointment at the University, that of Privatdozentur, was\ncancelled, being replaced by the position \u201cDozentur neuer\nOrdnung,\u201d granted to candidates only after they had passed a\nracial\n test.[3]\n G\u00f6del\u2019s three trips the United States during that decade\ntriggered an investigation. (See Sigmund 2006.) Finally, G\u00f6del\nwas found fit for military service by the Nazi government in 1939.\n\nAll of these events were decisive in influencing his decision to leave\nAustria in 1940, when he and his wife Adele emigrated to the United\nStates. This long and difficult episode in their life is recounted by\nJohn Dawson in his biography of G\u00f6del called \u201cLogical\nDilemmas,\u201d (Dawson 1997) as well as by Solomon Feferman in\n\u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s Life and Work,\u201d (Feferman 1986) to\nboth of which the reader is referred.\n\nUpon arrival G\u00f6del took up an appointment as an ordinary member\nat the Institute for Advanced Study; he would become a permanent\nmember of the Institute in 1946 and would be granted his professorship\nin 1953. (G\u00f6del and his wife were granted American citizenship in\nApril 1948.) He would remain at the Institute until his retirement in\n1976. The G\u00f6dels never returned to Europe.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s early years at the Institute were notable for his\nclose friendship with his daily walking partner Albert Einstein, as\nwell as for his turn to philosophy of mathematics, a field on which\nG\u00f6del began to concentrate almost exclusively from about 1943.\nThe initial period of his subsequent lifelong involvement with\nphilosophy was a fruitful one (in terms of publications): in 1944 he\npublished his first philosophical paper, entitled \u201cOn\nRussell\u2019s Mathematical Logic\u201d (G\u00f6del 1944), and in\n1947 he published his second, entitled \u201cWhat is Cantor\u2019s\nContinuum Hypothesis?\u201d (G\u00f6del 1947). In 1949 he published\nhis third, entitled \u201cA Remark on the Relationship between\nRelativity Theory and Idealistic Philosophy.\u201d (G\u00f6del\n1949a). The latter paper coincided with results on rotating universes\nin relativity he had obtained in 1949, which were first published in\nan article entitled: \u201cAn Example of a New Type of Cosmological\nSolutions of Einstein\u2019s Field Equations of Gravitation.\u201d\n(G\u00f6del 1949).\n\nAmong G\u00f6del\u2019s other significant philosophical works of the\n1940s must be counted his 1941 lecture entitled \u201cIn What Sense\nis Intuitionistic Logic Constructive?\u201d (G\u00f6del *1941) in\nwhich the notion: \u201ccomputable function of finite type\u201d is\nintroduced. A paper based on the ideas in the lecture entitled\n\u201c\u00dcber eine bisher noch nicht ben\u00fctzte Erweiterung des\nfiniten Standpunktes,\u201d was published only in 1958, and the\ninterpretation of Heyting arithmetic into the quantifier free calculus\nT in it became known as the \u201cDialectica\nInterpretation,\u201d after the journal in which the article was\npublished (G\u00f6del 1958). (For the revision of it from 1972, see\nG\u00f6del 1995.) Finally the decade saw the beginning of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s intensive study of Leibniz, which, G\u00f6del\nreports, occupied the period from 1943 to\n 1946.[4]\n\nThe 1950s saw a deepening of G\u00f6del\u2019s involvement with\nphilosophy: In 1951 G\u00f6del delivered a philosophical lecture at\nBrown University, usually referred to as the Gibbs Lecture, entitled\n\u201cSome Basic Theorems on the Foundations of Mathematics and Their\nPhilosophical Implications\u201d (G\u00f6del *1951). From 1953 to\n1959 G\u00f6del worked on a submission to the Schilpp volume on Rudolf\nCarnap entitled \u201cIs Mathematics a Syntax of Language?\u201d\n(G\u00f6del *1953/9-III, G\u00f6del *1953/9-V). G\u00f6del published\nneither of these two important manuscripts in his lifetime, although\nboth would appear on two lists which were found in the G\u00f6del\nNachlass, entitled \u201cWas ich publizieren k\u00f6nnte.\u201d (In\nEnglish: \u201cWhat I could publish.\u201d Both manuscripts\neventually appeared in G\u00f6del 1995.) By the decade\u2019s close\nG\u00f6del developed a serious interest in\n phenomenology.[5]\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s final years are notable for his circulation of two\nmanuscripts: \u201cSome considerations leading to the probable\nconclusion that the true power of the continuum is\n\u21352,\u201d (G\u00f6del *1970a, *1970b) his attempt\nto derive the value of the continuum from the so-called scale axioms\nof Hausdorff, and his \u201cOntologischer Beweis,\u201d (G\u00f6del\n*1970) which he entrusted to Dana Scott in 1970 (though it appears to\nhave been written earlier). Taken together, the two manuscripts are\nthe fitting last words of someone who, in a fifty year involvement\nwith mathematics and philosophy, pursued, or more precisely,\nsought the grounds for pursuing those two subjects under the\nsingle heading: \u201cstrenge Wissenschaft\u201d\u2014a turn of\nmind that had been in place from G\u00f6del\u2019s start in 1929,\nwhen at the age of twenty-three he opened his doctoral thesis with\nsome philosophical remarks.\n\nG\u00f6del died in Princeton on January 14, 1978 at the age of 71. His\ndeath certificate records the cause of death as \u201cstarvation and\ninanition, due to personality disorder.\u201d His wife Adele survived\nhim by three years.\n\nFor further biographical material, see G\u00f6del 1987, Kleene 1987,\nKreisel 1980, Taussky-Todd 1987 and Yourgrau 2005.\n",
