The conception of time\nmirrors that of space: it is that in virtue of which statements of the\nform \u201cA is earlier than B\u201d are objectively true of false.\nTime is said to differ from space, and thus not be identical with it,\nin the following respect: whereas what is spatially near or far varies\nfrom person to person, what is temporally near or far is the same for\nall persons (cf. Bhaduri 1947, Mohanty 1992). But why should we\nrestrict our attention only to presently existing persons?\n\nIn the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra, Gautama mentions an argument\nagainst the possibility of present time remarkably similar to (and\nperhaps even derived from) N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s arguments\nagainst motion. NS 2.1.39 (paraphrased): There is no such thing as the\npresent time, because, when an object is falling to the ground, each\npoint on its descent belongs either to the already-traversed sector or\nto the yet-to-be-traversed sector. There is therefore, no point on the\ntrajectory to which the present time can be attributed. The present\ntime is an imaginary point of demarcation between the past and the\nfuture. Gautama replies (NS 2.1.40\u201342) to this by saying (i)\nthat the concepts of \u2018past\u2019 and \u2018future\u2019 are\nrelative to that of the \u2018present\u2019, and not to each other,\nand (ii) that the denial of the present has an absurd consequence,\nthat nothing can be known perceptually, as perception functions in the\npresent. The point of (i), perhaps, is that even if the present is\njust a boundary, it is not thereby imaginary.\n",
