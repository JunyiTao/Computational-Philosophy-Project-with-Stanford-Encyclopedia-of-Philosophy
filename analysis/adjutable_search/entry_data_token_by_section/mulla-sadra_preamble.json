    "main_text": "\n\nSadr al-Din Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. Yahya Qawami Shirazi (ca.\n1571\u20131636) is arguably the most significant Islamic philosopher\nafter Avicenna. Best known as Mulla Sadra, he was later given the\ntitle of Sadr al-Muta\u2019allihin (Master of the theosists) for his\napproach to philosophy that combined an interest in theology and drew\nupon insights from mystical intuition. He considered philosophy to be\na set of spiritual exercises and a process of theosis, a pursuit of\nwisdom whose goal was to acquire wisdom and become a sage, and hence\nbecome godlike. He championed a radical philosophical method that\nattempted to transcend the simple dichotomy between a discursive,\nratiocinative mode of reasoning and knowing, and a more intuitive,\npoetic and non-propositional mode of knowledge. He became famous as\nthe thinker who revolutionized the doctrine of existence in Islamic\nmetaphysics. By critiquing an Aristotelian metaphysics which assumed\nthat the basic stuff of reality was constituted by substances, he\ninitiated a (Neoplatonic) process metaphysics of change, founded upon\nand moved by acts of being. A keen thinker who wrote works in\nphilosophy, theology, mysticism, and scriptural exegesis, he attempted\na wide-ranging synthesis of approaches to Islamic thought and argued\nfor the necessity of the method of understanding reality through a\nmixture of logical reasoning, spiritual inspiration, and a deep\nmeditation upon the key scriptural sources of the Twelver Shi\u2018i\ntradition in Islam. Having a holistic approach to philosophical\ninquiry, his understanding of the pursuit of wisdom included\nscriptural hermeneutics and exegesis as well as theological reasoning.\nA key figure of a group of thinkers whom Nasr and Corbin referred to\nas the \u201cSchool of Isfahan\u201d, he played a major role in\nintellectual life during the revitalization of philosophy under the\nSafavid Shah \u2018Abbas I (r. 996\u20131038 AH/1588\u20131629 CE)\nand later on in life was the most important teacher at the\nphilosophical seminary known as Madrasa-yi Khan in his hometown of\nShiraz. Since the early 19th century, the thought of Mulla Sadra has\nbecome the dominant philosophical paradigm in the Shi\u2018i seminary\nin the Islamic East and was also widely influential in South Asia.\n",
