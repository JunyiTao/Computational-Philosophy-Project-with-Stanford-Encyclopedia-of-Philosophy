    "main_text": "Feminist Contributions to Bioethics Theory || Relationality and relational autonomy\n4.2 Relationality and relational autonomy\n\nFeminist bioethics\u2019 approach to care is grounded in its\nrelational ontology, that is the claim that the self is constituted\nthrough relationships, as discussed earlier. As Annette Baier\nwrote,\n\n\nA person, perhaps, is best seen as one who was long enough dependent\nupon other persons to acquire the essential arts of personhood.\nPersons essentially are second persons, who grow up with\nother persons. (Baier 1985: 84)\n\n\nThis theoretical basis in turn underpins the moral significance of\nrelationality, and the responsibilities and obligations of\nrelationships, particularly in the context of healthcare. These\nrelationships arise between patient and healthcare providers, patients\nand families, and include more novel forms such as those between a\ngamete or embryo donor, and the children that result (Sherwin &\nStockdale 2017).\n\nA relational model of the self sees individuals as inextricably\nconnected in an enduring network of familial, community, and wider\nconnections that create and sustain them as persons. Feminism\u2019s\nrelational view of the self provides the basis for a distinctive view\nof the autonomous self, called relational autonomy, in which autonomy\nis not a property of a person but is effected through the networks of\ninteraction that make up social life (Donchin 2000; Mackenzie &\nStoljar 2000). Relational autonomy considers a person\u2019s capacity\nfor self-determination to be dependent on the\nconnections\u2014personal and institutional\u2014that come into\nplay, and whether these foster or constrain autonomous action depends\non the detail of precisely how they operate in the given situation.\nThis view is in stark contrast to moral philosophy\u2019s traditional\nformulation of personal autonomy as the individual\u2019s capacity to\nact as an independent decision-maker, uncontaminated by any influence\nfrom or concerns about other agents. Ethical analyses based on this\nideal generally omit as irrelevant the particularities of\nintrafamilial relationships, as well as the wider context of\ninstitutional power relationships and social dynamics that influence\npatient options, and the medical research priorities that shape\nthem.\n\nRelational autonomy is not simply a statement about practicalities\n(that we need others in order to realize our choices), but a claim\nthat the internal capacity to be self-determining is itself a result\nof early experiences in family and community that provide us with the\ntools to reflect on how we want our lives to go and how to make that\nhappen. According to relational autonomy theorists, autonomy is not a\nproperty possessed by all competent adults, but a developmental\nachievement that requires social cooperation and supportive\ninstitutions. The crucial point is that feminism\u2019s critique is\nnot that the traditional concept of autonomy is unachievable because\npeople are constrained from exercising authentic autonomy due to their\nsocial entanglements. Rather, it is that this model is just\nfundamentally wrong, because it is exactly that network of\nrelationships that provides the conditions of possibility for\nself-determination and self-actualization in the first place. Autonomy\nis inherently produced through relationships, not compromised by\nthem.\n\nRespect for the autonomy of the individual patient or research subject\nis a core principle of bioethics, underpinning informed consent and\npatient choice. Indeed, mainstream bioethics and medical ethics have\nsometimes been accused of effectively reducing autonomy to informed\nconsent and the ability of a patient to select between a limited set\nof clinical options. From a feminist point of view, a more adequate\nconceptualization of autonomy must take into account the entirety of\nthe relational context. Combined with feminist theory\u2019s focus on\nthe power structures of systems and institutions, relational autonomy\npushes beyond the analysis of interpersonal constraints on patient\nautonomy (e.g., the authority differential between patient and\nhealthcare provider) to consider the effects of larger scale\nstructures and environments, and of social norms and pressures. For\nexample, Carolyn Ells uses a Foucauldian analysis to argue that the\nstandard depiction of patient choice relies on a false model that\ntreats them as if they existed outside the relations of power that in\nfact are diffused throughout society, and to consider the implications\nof a relational model of autonomy for the practice of patient-centered\ncare (Ells 2003; Ells et al. 2011).\n\nWhile accepting that the principle of respect for autonomy has been\nessential to the protection of individual liberty, including the\nliberty of women, feminist bioethics has considerable reservations\nabout its relevance to socially disempowered groups for whom the\npossibilities of self-determination are always constrained by\nmaterial, social, and political factors (Gibson 2019). Serene Khader\n(2020) has expressed concern that relational autonomy theorists\nimplicitly hold that autonomy can only be achieved in ideal\nconditions, which in reality means never. Other feminists have\nexamined how autonomy can be constrained by features that are less\nobviously a product of power relationships or oppressive social\nenvironments. McLeod (2002) has used examples from reproductive\nmedicine to show that encounters with healthcare providers can\nundermine a woman\u2019s self-trust, thereby threatening her\nautonomy. Meanwhile, feminist attention to the moral relevance of\nembodied experience has identified trauma, abuse, inexperience,\nimpairment or illness, and relational responses to these states, as\npotentially compromising autonomy (Donchin 2000; Brison 2001; Goering\n2009; Scully 2010; McDonald 2018).\n",
