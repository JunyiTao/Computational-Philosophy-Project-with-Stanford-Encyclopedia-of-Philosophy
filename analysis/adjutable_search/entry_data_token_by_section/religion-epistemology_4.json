The Relevance of Newman\n\n\nAlthough pre-dating the current debate, John Henry Newman\u2019s\nrejection of Locke\u2019s and Paley\u2019s evidentialism is relevant\nto the problematic of contemporary epistemology of religion. First he\nquite clearly rejected the hegemony of epistemology. His procedure was\nto examine how in fact people made up their minds on non-religious\nissues and argue that by the same standards religious beliefs were\njustified. As a result he qualified evidentialism by insisting that\nan implicit and\ncumulative argument could lead to justified certainty. (See\nMitchell 1990.) \n\n\nNewman\u2019s position has two interpretations. One, which differs little\nfrom Swinburne\u2019s probabilistic approach to natural theology, asserts\nthat the consilience of a number of independent pieces of probable\nreasoning can result in a probability so high as to be negligibly\ndifferent from certainty. If, to use an example Newman would not have\nliked, Aquinas\u2019s five ways were independent and each had probability\n75% then taken together their probability is about 99.9%. One\ndifficulty with this interpretation is that even a highly probable\nargument differs from a demonstration in that the former is vulnerable\nto probabilistic counter-arguments. Thus a probabilistic version of\nthe Argument from Evil might subsequently reduce the probability from\n99.9% down to 75% again.\n\n\nThe other interpretation of Newman\u2019s position is to say that\nevidentialism falsely presupposes that there are fine gradations on a\nscale from full belief through partial belief to partial disbelief to\nfull disbelief. Newman claims that human beings are not like that when\nit comes to those beliefs which form part of religious faith. In such\ncases the only available states are those of full belief and full\ndisbelief or, perhaps, full belief, and lack of full belief. Of course\nsomeone can believe that theism has a probability between 90% and 60%,\nsay, but that could be interpreted as believing that relative to the\nevidence theism has a probability between 90% and 60%, which, in turn,\nis a comment on the strength of the case for theism not the expression\nof a merely partial belief.\n\n\nIf Newman is right then evidentialism is slightly wrong. Instead of\nrequiring belief to be proportioned to the evidence, full belief is\njustified if the case for it holds \u201con the balance of\nprobabilities\u201d.  Hence a natural theology consisting of merely\nprobable arguments, such as Swinburne\u2019s, can still show full\nreligious belief to be justified.\n",
