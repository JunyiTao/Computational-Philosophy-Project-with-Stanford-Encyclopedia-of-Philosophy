    "main_text": "Logic || Rhetoric and Dialectic\n3.1 Rhetoric and Dialectic\n\nThe branch of logic is subdivided into rhetoric and dialectic\n(Diogenes Laertius, 31A). The former is described as \u201cthe\nscience [or knowledge, epist\u00eam\u00ea] of speaking\nwell\u201d, though it also included, for example, extensive study of\netymology (for more on rhetoric, and in particular how narrow its\nscope might have been, see Atherton 1988). Dialectic is \u201cthe\nscience [or knowledge, epist\u00eam\u00ea] of what is true,\nfalse, and neither\u201d or \u201cthe science [or knowledge,\nepist\u00eam\u00ea] of what signifies and what is\nsignified\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, 32C), mastery of which is\nrequired for wisdom, since \u201cthe Sage is always a\ndialectician\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, 31C; the \u201cSage\u201d\nbeing the Stoic label for the ideal human being, i.e. the wise and\nvirtuous person). Dialectic as a field of study first sprung from the\npractice of dialectic in the form of questions and answers but became,\nlargely under the influence of Chrysippus, increasingly systematized\nand more technical to include the in-depth study of language, meaning,\narguments, and epistemology (cf. Gourinat 2000; Castagnoli 2010). It\nis in fact in dialectic that we find most of the material that\ninfluences the later so-called technical grammarians (on which see\nmore below,\n 5.1,\n cf. Atherton and Blank 2003). This goes hand in hand with the\nsystematicity of Stoic philosophy. The Stoics believed language to be\ninherently natural and to be such as to match the natural, rational\norder of things, so that language has a natural propensity to capture\nobjects in the world and its structure. The study of language in\ndialectic is thus an integral part of Stoic philosophy as a whole.\n",
