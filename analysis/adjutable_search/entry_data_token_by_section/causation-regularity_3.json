    "main_text": "Regularity Theories of Causation || INUS Conditions\n1.3 INUS Conditions\n\nOn the Millian Regularity Theory, a cause is nomologically sufficient\nfor its effect: there is a law of nature such that the occurrence of a\ncause suffices for the occurrence of its effect. A cause is taken to\nbe a totality of positive and negative factors which is sufficient and\nnecessary for the effect. However, one and the same effect can have\nmany causes understood as sufficient and necessary totalities\n(as has already been observed by Venn 1889). Each of these distinct\ntotalities, or clusters of factors, is sufficient to bring about the\neffect, but no single one is necessary if another cluster is\nactual.\n\nMackie (1974: 63) conceives of each cluster of factors as a\nconjunction, for example \\(C \\land \\neg A\\), where \\(C\\) is a type of\nevent and \\(\\neg A\\) is the absence of any event of type \\(A\\).\nConsider, for instance, a house which burns to the ground. There is a\nvariety of distinct clusters which can cause the burning of the house.\nOne cluster includes a short-circuit, the presence of oxygen, the\nabsence of a sprinkler system, and so on. Another cluster includes an\narsonist, the use of petrol, again the presence of oxygen, and so on.\nYet another cluster includes a burning tree falling on the house, and\nso on. Each cluster is a conjunction of single factors. The\ndisjunction of all clusters represents then the plurality of causes\n(see Mackie 1965: 245 and 1974: 37\u201338 for details).\n\nThe disjunction of all clusters for an effect is relative to a\ncausal field. A causal field is \u201ca background against\nwhich the causing goes on\u201d (1974: 63). Roughly, a causal field\ncaptures the circumstances which are kept fixed and so cannot even be\nconsidered as (part of) a cause. Or, as Mackie puts it, what is caused\nis\n\n\nnot just an event, but an event-in-a-certain-field, and some\nconditions can be set aside as not causing this-event-in-this-field\nsimply because they are part of the chosen field. (1974: 35)\n\n\nSuppose a causal field includes that a certain person was born and\nalive for a while. Being born thus cannot be a cause of the\nperson\u2019s death relative to this causal field. However, with\nenough ingenuity, the person being born is a cause of the\nperson\u2019s death relative to a causal field which does not include\nthat the person was born and alive for a while as a part of the fixed\nbackground (see 1974: 37).\n\nThis suggests that the regularity for an effect is a disjunction of\nconjunctions which is necessary and sufficient for the effect relative\nto a causal field. Relative to this field, each cluster is sufficient\nfor the burning of the house, but no single one is necessary; for\nanother cluster can be sufficient for the burning. (\\(C\\) is\nsufficient for \\(E\\) means that, whenever an event of type \\(C\\)\noccurs, so does an event of type \\(E\\). \\(C\\) is necessary for \\(E\\)\nmeans that an event of type \\(E\\) only occurs if an event of type\n\\(C\\) occurs.) For simplicity, suppose the complex regularity\n(relative to a particular causal field) has the form: \n\n\\[(C_1 \\land C_2) \\lor D_1 \\leftrightarrow E.\\]\n\n\nOn the one hand, any cluster, for example \\(C_1 \\land C_2\\), is\nminimally sufficient for \\(E\\) (and so is the\n\u201ccluster\u201d \\(D_1\\)). \\(C_1 \\land C_2\\) is minimally\nsufficient for \\(E\\) means that the cluster is sufficient for \\(E\\)\nand each conjunct of the cluster is necessary for its sufficiency. So\nno conjunct of any cluster is redundant for bringing about the effect.\nOn the other hand, neither cluster is necessary for the effect \\(E\\).\n\\(C_1 \\land C_2\\) is minimally sufficient but not necessary for \\(E\\).\n\\(E\\) occurs if \\(D_1\\) does. Now, focus on \\(C_1\\) which is on its\nown insufficient to bring about \\(E\\). \\(C_1\\) is a single factor of\nthe cluster \\(C_1 \\land C_2\\) which is a sufficient but unnecessary\ncondition for \\(E\\). Hence, \\(C_1\\) is an insufficient but\nnon-redundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient condition for\n\\(E\\) (relative to a causal field). Or simply, \\(C_1\\) is an INUS\ncondition for \\(E\\).\n\nIn general, a complex regularity has the form: \n\n\\[(C_{1,1} \\land \\ldots \\land C_{1, n}) \\lor \\ldots \\lor (C_{k, 1} \\land \\ldots \\land C_{k, m}) \\leftrightarrow E.\\]\n\n\nEach single factor \\(C_{i, j}\\) of a cluster is a potential cause.\nHence, a cause is at least an INUS condition (relative to a particular\ncausal field). \u201cAt least\u201d because there are limiting\ncases:\n\n(i)\nif the regularity has the form \\[C_{1} \\lor C_{2} \\leftrightarrow E,\\] the cause \\(C_1\\) is a sufficient condition for \\(E\\);\n(ii)\nif the regularity has the form \\[C_{1} \\land C_{2} \\leftrightarrow E,\\] the cause \\(C_1\\) is a necessary condition for \\(E\\); and\n(iii)\nif the regularity has the form \\[C_{1} \\leftrightarrow E,\\] the cause \\(C_1\\) is a necessary and sufficient condition for \\(E\\).\n\n\nOn Mackie\u2019s theory, a factor \\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E\\) iff \\(C\\)\nis at least an INUS condition of \\(E\\), and each factor of the cluster\nthat contains \\(C\\) and is sufficient for \\(E\\) is instantiated.\n\nHow does Mackie\u2019s theory of causation go beyond the regularity\ntheories by Hume and Mill? Unlike HRT, Mackie\u2019s theory captures\ncausal scenarios where several different events are necessary to bring\nabout a certain effect, and so qualify as a cause of the latter. Take\nthe regularity \n\n\\[(C_1 \\land C_2) \\lor D_1 \\leftrightarrow E.\\]\n\n\nSuppose \\(C_1, C_2,\\) and \\(D_1\\) occur independently of one another.\nThere is neither a strict positive nor a strict negative correlation\namong these events. There are cases where \\(C_1\\) does not occur but\n\\(D_1\\) does, and so \\(E\\) will occur. There are also cases where\n\\(C_1\\) occurs but \\(C_2\\) and \\(D_1\\) do not, and so \\(E\\) will not\noccur. And there will be cases where \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) occur\ntogether so that an instance of \\(C_1\\) qualifies as a cause of an\ninstance of \\(E\\). An event of type \\(C_1\\) may therefore be a cause\nof an event of type \\(E\\), without there being a strict regular\nsuccession between \\(C_1\\)-events and \\(E\\)-events. This being said,\nHume (1739: book I, part III, section XV) considers causation without\nstrict regular succession. There, he seems to propose a regularity\ntheory that goes beyond HRT and may cover causation based on\nnon-strict succession.\n\nThe advantages of Mackie\u2019s theory over Mill\u2019s are less\nobvious. Recall that for Mill, a cause is a totality of positive and\nnegative factors such that, in the respective causal scenario, this\ntotality is sufficient for \\(E\\). On this theory, events of type \\(C\\)\nmay be members of a cause for an effect of type \\(E\\), without there\nbeing a strict regular succession between \\(C\\)-events and\n\\(E\\)-events. Moreover, the notion of a totality of factors is\nconsistent with there being several totalities that are sufficient to\nbring about an event of type \\(E\\). In other words, several totalities\nmay serve as instances of some cluster in one and the same\nMackie-style regularity. These totalities may be represented by\nconjunctions and joined by disjunctions. If we amend the Millian\nregularity theory by a requirement of minimal sufficiency, it seems as\nif we can go back and forth between a Mill-style and a Mackie-style\nrepresentation of causes, with the qualification that causes in the\nsense of Mackie are mere factors of a cause in the sense of Mill. In\nthis sense, the two theories seem to be intertranslatable. It should\nbe pointed out, however, that Mackie\u2019s theory gives us a more\nexplicit and concise representation of the several totalities, or\nclusters, which are minimally sufficient to bring about a certain type\nof effect. The complex regularities and their elegant logical\nrepresentation have not been in the conceptual repertoire of Mill.\n\nAnother merit of Mackie\u2019s theory is that it provides an\nexplanation for causal inference. If we know that an effect of type\n\\(E\\) occurred, and that \\(D_1\\) was not present, we may infer that\nthe cluster \\((C_1 \\land C_2)\\) occurred. In particular, we may infer\nthat \\(C_1\\) caused \\(E\\).\n\nMackie\u2019s regularity theory of causation still fails to\ndistinguish between genuine causes and mere joint effects of a common\ncause. To see this, consider an example adapted from Russell (1921\n[1961: 289]): the sounding of factory hooters in Manchester is\nregularly followed by London workers leaving their work. And yet the\nformer is not a cause of the latter. However, as Mackie (1974:\n81\u201384) himself points out, the sounding of the hooters in\nManchester counts as a cause for the workers going home in London:\n\n\nIn more concrete terms, the sounding of the Manchester factory\nhooters, plus the absence of whatever conditions would make them sound\nwhen it wasn\u2019t five o\u2019clock, plus the presence of whatever\nconditions are, along with its being five o\u2019clock, jointly\nsufficient for the Londoners to stop work a moment\nlater\u2014including, say, automatic devices for setting off the\nLondon hooters at five o\u2019clock, is a conjunction of features\nwhich is unconditionally followed by the Londoners stopping work.\n(1974: 84)\n\n\nThe structure of the example can be given as follows. There are two\ninstantiated effects \\(E_1\\) (the sounding of the hooters in\nManchester) and \\(E_2\\) (the workers going home in London) such that\n\\(C_1\\) (knocking-off time at five o\u2019clock) is an instantiated\ncommon INUS condition: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} (C_1 \\land C_2) & \\lor D \\leftrightarrow E_1, \\text{ and}\\\\ (C_1 \\land C_3) & \\lor B \\leftrightarrow E_2. \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nFurthermore, let\u2019s say that \\(C_2\\) and \\(C_3\\) are instantiated\non this particular occasion. Well then, \\(C_1\\) counts as a common\ncause of \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) on Mackie\u2019s theory.\n\nIn the presence of the complex regularities, the cluster\n\n\\[E_1 \\land \\neg D \\land C_3\\]\n\n\nis sufficient for \\(E_2\\). Indeed, the cluster of the sounding of the\nhooters in Manchester (\\(E_1\\)), the absence of any conditions that\nwould make the Manchester hooters sound when it was not five\no\u2019clock (\\(\\neg D\\)), and the presence of all conditions\n(\\(C_3\\)) that are together with it being five o\u2019clock (\\(C_1\\))\njointly sufficient for the workers going home in London\n(\\(E_2\\))\u2014this cluster is sufficient for the workers going home\nin London. Hence, \\(E_1\\) is at least an INUS condition of \\(E_2\\). If\n\\(D\\) is not instantiated, but \\(C_2,\\) \\(C_3,\\) \\(E_1,\\) and \\(E_2\\)\nare, then the instantiation of \\(E_1\\) counts as a cause of the one of\n\\(E_2\\). More generally, an effect of a cause \\(C_1\\) may be part of\nan instantiated cluster sufficient for another effect of \\(C_1\\). This\nshows that, on Mackie\u2019s theory, an effect of a common cause may\nfalsely count as a cause for another effect of said common cause.\n\nFor Mackie (1974: 85\u201386), this type of problem indicates that\nhis regularity theory is at best incomplete. And he tells us what is\nmissing: a genuine cause-effect relation is marked by causal priority.\nAs an approximation, a token event \\(c\\) was causally prior to another\ntoken event \\(e\\) if an agent could have\u2014in\nprinciple\u2014prevented \\(e\\) by \u201c(directly or indirectly)\npreventing, or failing to bring about or to do \\(c\\)\u201d (1974:\n190). To prevent the sounding of the Manchester hooters does not\nprevent the workers from going home in London. Hence, the instance of\n\\(E_1\\) was not causally prior to the associated instance of \\(E_2\\)\n(though it is temporally prior). By contrast, preventing the sounding\nof the London hooters does prevent the workers from going home in\nLondon.\n\nThe approximate relation of causal priority is interventionist. Causes\nare seen as devices for an (ideal) agent to manipulate an effect.\nHowever, Mackie did not propose an interventionist theory of\ncausation. His final notion of causal priority is independent of a\nnotion of agency. \\(c\\) was causally prior to \\(e\\) if there was a\ntime at which \\(c\\) was fixed while \\(e\\) was unfixed (see 1974:\n180-183 and 189-192). It should be noted, however, that Mackie himself\ndoes not think that his analysis of causal priority succeeds (1974:\nxiv).\n\nAnother problem for Mackie\u2019s regularity theory is that the\ncomplex regularities seem to be symmetric. This symmetry blurs the\nasymmetry between cause and effect, and leads to the problem of the\ndirection of causation. Like Hume, one could stipulate that causes\nprecede their effects in time. The direction of causation is thus\nsimply the direction of time. However, this stipulation excludes both\nthe possibility of (a) backwards causation and (b) an analysis of\n\u201ctime\u2019s arrow\u201d in terms of causation. Since\u2014to\nthe best of our knowledge\u2014there is no account of causation which\nhas fully solved the problem of the causal direction, the objections\n(a) and (b) do not speak decisively against the regularity theory.\n",
