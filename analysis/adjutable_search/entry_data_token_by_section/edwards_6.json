    "main_text": "Value Theory || Aesthetics\n3.2 Aesthetics\n\nIn Edwards' view, beauty or \u201cexcellency\u201d \u201cconsists\nin the similarness of one being to another \u2014 not merely equality\nand proportion, but any kind of similarness\u2026.This is an\nuniversal definition of excellency: The consent of being to\nbeing\u2026\u201d (\u201cThe Mind,\u201d no. 1; Edwards\n1957\u2013, vol. 6, 336). One who loves others, for instance, or\nactively desires their welfare, \u201cagrees\u201d with them or\n\u201cconsents\u201d to them. Love's scope can be narrower or wider,\nhowever. Agreement or consent is \u201ccomprehensive\u201d or\n\u201cuniversal\u201d only when directed towards being in general.\nOnly true benevolence, therefore, is truly beautiful.\n\n\u201cSecondary\u201d beauty is a mere \u201cimage\u201d or\n\u201cresemblance\u201d of true beauty. It consists in\n\u201csymmetry,\u201d \u201charmony,\u201d or\n\u201cproportion,\u201d or \u201cas Mr. Hutcheson\u201d says, in\n\u201cagreement of different things in form, manner, quantity, and\nvisible end or design,\u201d i.e., in \u201cregularity.\u201d The\nbeauty of well-ordered societies, of \u201cwisdom\u2026consisting\nin the united tendency of thoughts, ideas, and particular volitions to\none general purpose,\u201d of the natural fitness of actions and\ncircumstances (having made a promise, for example, and keeping it),\n\u201cof a building, of a flower, or of the rainbow\u201d are\nexamples (True Virtue, 1765; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 8,\n561\u201362).\n\nSince God's benevolence alone is perfect, he is the only thing that is\n(truly) beautiful without qualification. The fitness of God's\ndispensations, the harmony of his providential design, and so on, also\nexhibit the highest degree of secondary beauty. God is thus\n\u201cinfinitely the most beautiful and excellent,\u201d the measure\nof both primary and secondary beauty. Moreover, he is the\n\u201cfoundation and fountain of all beauty.\u201d \u201cAll the\nbeauty to be found throughout the whole creation is\u2026the\nreflection of the diffused beams of that being who hath an infinite\nfullness of brightness and glory\u201d (True Virtue, 1765;\nEdwards 1957\u2013, vol. 8, 550\u201351). And God's world is indeed\nsaturated with beauty \u2014 not only the \u201charmony of\nsounds, and the beauties of nature\u201d (which bear the greatest\nresemblance to true or primary beauty, and to which Edwards was\nespecially sensitive) but also (and primarily) the beauty of the\nGospel, of God's providential work in history, and of the saints (the\nelect). The saints alone, however, can discern true beauty.\n",
