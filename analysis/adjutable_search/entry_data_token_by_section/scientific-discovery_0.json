    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nPhilosophical reflection on scientific discovery occurred in different\nphases. Prior to the 1930s, philosophers were mostly concerned with\ndiscoveries in the broad sense of the term, that is, with the analysis\nof successful scientific inquiry as a whole. Philosophical discussions\nfocused on the question of whether there were any discernible patterns\nin the production of new knowledge. Because the concept of discovery\ndid not have a specified meaning and was used in a very wide sense,\nalmost all discussions of scientific method and practice could\npotentially be considered as early contributions to reflections on\nscientific discovery. In the course of the 18th century, as\nphilosophy of science and science gradually became two distinct\nendeavors with different audiences, the term \u201cdiscovery\u201d\nbecame a technical term in philosophical discussions. Different\nelements of scientific inquiry were specified. Most importantly,\nduring the 19th century, the generation of new knowledge\ncame to be clearly and explicitly distinguished from its assessment,\nand thus the conditions for the narrower notion of discovery as the\nact or process of conceiving new ideas emerged. This distinction was\nencapsulated in the so-called \u201ccontext distinction,\u201d\nbetween the \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d and the \u201ccontext\nof justification\u201d.\n\nMuch of the discussion about scientific discovery in the\n20th century revolved around this distinction It was argued\nthat conceiving a new idea is a non-rational process, a leap of\ninsight that cannot be captured in specific instructions.\nJustification, by contrast, is a systematic process of applying\nevaluative criteria to knowledge claims. Advocates of the context\ndistinction argued that philosophy of science is exclusively concerned\nwith the context of justification. The assumption underlying this\nargument is that philosophy is a normative project; it determines\nnorms for scientific practice. Given this assumption, only the\njustification of ideas, not their generation, can be the subject of\nphilosophical (normative) analysis. Discovery, by contrast, can only\nbe a topic for empirical study. By definition, the study of discovery\nis outside the scope of philosophy of science proper.\n\nThe introduction of the context distinction and the disciplinary\ndistinction between empirical science studies and normative philosophy\nof science that was tied to it spawned meta-philosophical disputes.\nFor a long time, philosophical debates about discovery were shaped by\nthe notion that philosophical and empirical analyses are mutually\nexclusive. Some philosophers insisted, like their predecessors prior\nto the 1930s, that the philosopher\u2019s tasks include the analysis\nof actual scientific practices and that scientific resources be used\nto address philosophical problems. They maintained that it is a\nlegitimate task for philosophy of science to develop a theory of\nheuristics or problem solving. But this position was the minority view\nin philosophy of science until the last decades of the 20th\ncentury. Philosophers of discovery were thus compelled to demonstrate\nthat scientific discovery was in fact a legitimate part of philosophy\nof science. Philosophical reflections about the nature of scientific\ndiscovery had to be bolstered by meta-philosophical arguments about\nthe nature and scope of philosophy of science.\n\nToday, however, there is wide agreement that philosophy and empirical\nresearch are not mutually exclusive. Not only do empirical studies of\nactual scientific discoveries in past and present inform philosophical\nthought about the structure and cognitive mechanisms of discovery, but\nworks in psychology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and\nrelated fields have become integral parts of philosophical analyses of\nthe processes and conditions of the generation of new knowledge.\nSocial epistemology has opened up another perspective on scientific\ndiscovery, reconceptualizing knowledge generation as group\nprocess.\n",
