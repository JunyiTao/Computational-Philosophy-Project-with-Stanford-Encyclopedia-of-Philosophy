    "main_text": "Special Topics || Mathematical Proof\n5.4 Mathematical Proof\n\nWe know much about the concepts of formal proof and\nformal provability, their connection with algorithmic\ncomputability, and the principles by which these concepts are\ngoverned. We know, for instance, that the proofs of a formal system\nare computably enumerable, and that provability in a sound (strong\nenough) formal system is subject to G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness\ntheorems. But a mathematical proof as you find it in a mathematical\njournal is not a formal proof in the sense of the logicians: it is a\n(rigorous) informal proof (Myhill 1960, Detlefsen 1992,\nAntonutti 2010).\n\nFirst, whereas the collection of sentences provable in a formal system\nis always computably enumerable, we know much less about the\nextension of the concept of informal provability. Lucas\n(Lucas 1961), and later Penrose (Penrose 1989, 1994), have argued that\ninformal mathematical provability outstrips provability in any given\nformal system. But their arguments are widely regarded as\nunpersuasive. Benacerraf has argued against Lucas and Penrose that it\ncannot be excluded that there is a formal system \\(T\\) such that in fact\nmathematical provability extensionally coincides with provability in\n\\(T\\), even though we cannot know that it does (Benacerraf 1967). Others\nhave argued that the concept of informal mathematical provability is\nnot even clear enough for the question whether its extension is\ncomputably enumerable to have a definite answer (Horsten & Welch\n2016).\n\nSecond, there is no agreement about what the standard is for\nan argument to qualify as a mathematical proof. According to what may\nbe called the received view, a mathematical argument for a statement \\(p\\)\nconstitutes an informal mathematical proof if the argument allows a\ncompetent mathematician to transform it into a formal\ndeduction of \\(p\\) from generally accepted mathematical axioms\n(Avigad 2021). An informal mathematical proof can then be taken to be\na derivation-indicator for \\(p\\) (Azzouni 2004). But the received\nview of the standard of mathematical proof has come under attack in\nrecent years. It has been argued, for instance, that the\ninterpolations of reasons in an informal mathematical proof until a\nlogically correct and non-elliptical first-order derivation is\nreached, can be an infinite process (Rav 1999, p.14-15).\nOthers are mounting a defence of the received view, so that there is a\nlively debate about these issues at the moment (Tatton-Brown forthcoming,\nDi Toffoli 2021).\n\nThe past decades have witnessed the first occurrences of mathematical\nproofs in which computers appear to play an essential role. The\nfour-colour theorem is one example. It says that for every map, only\nfour colours are needed to colour countries in such a way that no two\ncountries that have a common border receive the same color. This\ntheorem was proved in 1976 (Appel et al. 1977). But the proof\ndistinguishes many cases which were verified by a computer. These\ncomputer verifications are too long to be double-checked by humans.\nThe proof of the four colour theorem gave rise to a debate about the\nquestion to what extent computer-assisted proofs count as proofs in\nthe true sense of the word.\n\nThe received view has it that mathematical proofs yield a priori\nknowledge. Yet when we rely on a computer to generate part of a proof,\nwe appear to rely on the proper functioning of computer hardware and\non the correctness of a computer program. These appear to be empirical\nfactors. Thus one is tempted to conclude that computer proofs yield\nquasi-empirical knowledge (Tymoczko 1979). In other words,\nthrough the advent of computer proofs the notion of proof has lost its\npurely a priori character. Burge, in contrast, held the view that\nbecause the empirical factors on which we rely when we accept computer\nproofs do not appear as premises in the argument, computer proofs can\nyield a priori knowledge after all (Burge 1998). (Burge later\nretracted this claim: see (Burge 2013, p.31).)\n",
