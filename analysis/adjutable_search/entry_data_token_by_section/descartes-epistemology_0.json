    "main_text": "Conception of Knowledge || Analysis of Perfect Knowledge\n1.1 Analysis of Perfect Knowledge\n\nI shall refer to the brand of knowledge Descartes seeks in the\nMeditations, as \u2018perfect knowledge\u2019 \u2013\na brand he sometimes discusses in connection with the Latin term scientia. Famously, he defines perfect knowledge in terms of doubt. While distinguishing perfect knowledge from lesser grades of conviction, he writes:\n\nI distinguish the two as follows: there is conviction\n[persuasio] when there remains some reason which might lead\nus to doubt, but knowledge [scientia] is conviction based on\na reason so strong that it can never be shaken by any stronger reason.\n(24 May 1640 letter to Regius, AT 3:65, CSMK 147)\n\n\nIn the Second Replies, he adds:\n\n\u2026 I shall now expound for a second time the basis on which\nit seems to me that all human certainty can be founded.\nFirst of all, as soon as we think that we\ncorrectly perceive something, we are spontaneously convinced that it\nis true. Now if this conviction is so firm that it is impossible for\nus ever to have any reason for doubting what we are convinced of, then\nthere are no further questions for us to ask: we have everything that\nwe could reasonably want. \u2026 For the supposition which we are\nmaking here is of a conviction so firm that it is quite incapable of\nbeing destroyed; and such a conviction is clearly the same as the most\nperfect certainty. (AT 7:144f, CSM 2:103)\n\n\nThese passages (and others) suggest an account wherein doubt is the\ncontrast of certainty. As my certainty increases, my doubt decreases;\nconversely, as my doubt increases, my certainty decreases. The\nrequirement that knowledge is to be based in complete, or perfect\ncertainty, thus amounts to requiring a complete inability to doubt\none\u2019s convictions \u2013 an utter indubitability. This\nconception of the relationship between certainty and doubt helps\nunderwrite Descartes\u2019 methodical emphasis on doubt, the\nso-called \u2018method of doubt\u2019 (discussed in\n Section 2).\n\nThat perfect knowledge requires that it be \u201cimpossible for\nus ever to have any reason for doubting what we are convinced\nof\u201d marks an extraordinarily high standard of justification.\nDoes Descartes view this as the only standard deserving of \nknowledge-talk? Arguably, no; yet this is a\ndifficult question, because he didn\u2019t write in English. He\nseems to be an epistemic contextualist, at least in the\nsense of invoking some notion of cognition, or \nknowledge, in divergent contexts presupposing different \nepistemic standards. We\u2019ll see, for example, that he holds\nthat even the deductive demonstrations of expert geometers may\nfall short of the standards needed for perfect knowledge; yet,\nthe kind of terminology he uses to characterize their epistemic \nachievements is routinely rendered in terms of knowledge-talk, in \nstandard English translations of his work.\n\nThe certainty/indubitability of interest to Descartes is psychological\nin character, though not merely psychological \u2013 not\nsimply an inexplicable feeling. It has also a distinctively epistemic\ncharacter involving a kind of rational insight. During moments of\ncertainty, it is as if my perception is guided by \u201ca great\nlight in the intellect\u201d (Med. 4, AT 7:59, CSM 2:41). This \nrational illumination empowers me to \u201csee utterly clearly\nwith my mind\u2019s eye\u201d; my feelings of certainty are\ngrounded \u2013 indeed, \u201cI see a manifest\ncontradiction\u201d in denying the proposition of which I\u2019m\nconvinced (Med. 3, AT 7:36, CSM 2:25).\n\nDescartes characterizes these epistemically impressive cognitions\nin terms of their being perceived clearly and\ndistinctly. The Meditations never defines these\nterms; indeed, it sometimes uses them in confusing ways (e.g.,\nsometimes using clarity-talk as a shorthand for the\nconjunction of clarity and distinctness). However, in the \nPrinciples Descartes offers the following definitions:\n\nI call a perception \u201cclear\u201d when it is present and\naccessible to the attentive mind \u2026 I call a perception\n\u201cdistinct\u201d if, as well as being clear, it is so sharply\nseparated from all other perceptions that it contains within itself\nonly what is clear. (Prin. 1:45, AT 8a:21f, CSM 1:207f)\n\n\nOther texts indicate that clarity contrasts with obscurity,\nand distinctness with confusedness. Though having clear and\ndistinct apprehension is epistemically impressive, we\u2019ll see\nclear texts indicating that this marks a merely necessary condition\nof perfect knowledge, not a sufficient condition.\n\nShould we regard Descartes\u2019 account of perfect knowledge as a\nversion of the justified true belief analysis of knowledge\ntracing back to Plato? The above texts are among Descartes\u2019\nclearest statements concerning perfect knowledge. Yet they raise\nquestions about the extent to which his account is continuous with\nother analyses of knowledge. Prima facie, his characterizations imply\na justified belief analysis \u2013 or, using language closer\nto his own (and where justification is construed in terms of\nunshakability), an unshakable conviction analysis.\nThere\u2019s no stated requirement that the would-be knower\u2019s\nconviction is to be true, as opposed to being unshakably\ncertain. Is truth, therefore, not a requirement of perfect\nknowledge? We\u2019ll return to the issue in\n Section 6.4.\n",
