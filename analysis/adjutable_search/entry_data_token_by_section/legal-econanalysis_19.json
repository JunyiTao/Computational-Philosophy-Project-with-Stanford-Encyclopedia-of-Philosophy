Consider a society of n\nindividuals, each of whom has a well-defined preference over all\npossible states of the world. The Pareto criterion states that a state\nof the world x is socially better than a state of the world\ny if and only if each individual considers state x at\nleast as preferred as state y and at least one person strictly\nprefers x to y. It follows from this definition, of\ncourse, that, if each individual prefers x to y, then\nx is socially better than y. \n\nThe Pareto criterion has a strong intuitive appeal. If everyone agrees\nthat a state x is preferred to a state y, certainly the\ncollective assessment must rank x more highly than y.\nThe Pareto criterion moreover appears to be weak, i.e., to impose few\nconstraints on social choice. After all, each member of the society\nwill only rarely rank two alternatives as every other member of the\nsociety. Nevertheless, the Pareto criterion has strong implications\nfor the aggregation of individual judgments. Indeed, as summarized\nbelow, the Pareto criterion is inconsistent with a large number of\nother principles, each of which also has strong intuitive appeal. \n\nPerhaps the inconsistency that would most disconcert an economist\narises between the Pareto criterion and the demand for aggregate\nrationality under uncertainty. Consider again our society of n\nindividuals. Assume now, though, that society must choose among a\nnumber of policies, the consequences of which will depend on the\nunderlying but unknown state of the world. Each individual has\npreferences over these policies that satisfy the axioms of subjective\nexpected utility theory. Consequently, one may represent each\nindividual\u2019s preference over actions by a set of preferences\nover consequences and a set of beliefs (that satisfy the probability\naxioms) over states of the world; moreover, the individual prefers\npolicy p to policy q if and only if the expected utility\nfrom policy p exceeds the expected utility from policy\nq. \n\nAggregate rationality imposes two constraints on the construction of\ncollective preference over policies. First, it demands the\nconstruction of a collective preference over policies that also\nsatisfies the axioms of subjective expected utility theory. Second,it\ndemands that each the collective preference be responsive to the\npreferences of the members of the collective. This demand implies,\nwhen individual preferences satisfy the axioms of subjective expected\nutility theory, that each component of the representation of\ncollective preference be responsive to the corresponding component of\nthe representations. Both the collective utility function and the\ncollective beliefs must be responsive to the individual utilities (or\npreferences over outcomes) and the individual beliefs about the\nlikelihood of states of the world. \n\nSuppose, in addition, that we demand that the collective preference\nsatisfy the Pareto criterion. That is, if each individual in society\nprefers policy p to policy q, then society collectively\nmust prefer p to q. Unfortunately, Seidenfeld, Kadane,\nand Schervish [1989] have proven that, if at least two individuals\nboth rank two consequences differently and assess the likelihoods of\ntwo states of the world differently, then society cannot\nsimultaneously satisfy the Pareto criterion and the demands of\naggregate rationality.\n\nThe Pareto criterion also conflicts with substantive moral claims.\nLarry Temkin [1993], for example, has argued that the Pareto criterion\nis inconsistent with the existence of communal goods. A communal good\nis one that provides social value but does not improve the well-being\nof any individual. A communal good, that is, is good for us\neven though it is good for no individual. He offers equality\nas an example. A society with equality of well-being, for instance,\nmight be better than a society in which individuals have highly\nunequal levels of well-being even if each person in the unequal\nsociety has higher well-being than she has in the more equal society.\n\n\nCommunal goods often seem scarce or improbable; how could something\nthat is good for us together be good for none of us in particular?\nMany people, for example, reject either the claim that equality is a\ncommunal good or that it is valuable at all. Our prior discussion in\nsection 6.1, however, suggests a host of potential other communal\n\u201cgoods\u201d. There is a sense in which each of the\ndeterminants of the structure of the social welfare function is good\nfor us without necessarily being good for anyone. At least for a\nwelfarist, the structure of the social welfare function is\nconstitutive of the good. Everyone might be \u201cbetter off\u201d\nunder a regime of slavery but that regime would nevertheless remain\nworse than a free society.\n\nThe Pareto criterion is also inconsistent with three different aspects\nof the value of autonomy: liberty, responsibility, and\nself-governance. A formal argument underlies each of these claims.\nAmartya Sen [1971] first articulated the conflict between the Pareto\ncriterion and liberty. He began from the standard social choice\nframework developed by Arrow [1963] in which each agent has\npreferences over final states of the world. He imposed two of the\nArrovian conditions, universal domain and the Pareto criterion, but\nsubstituted the condition of minimal liberty for the other two\n(non-dictatorship and independence of irrelevant alternatives).\nMinimal liberty is indeed minimal; Sen required only that each member\nin society was decisive over two alternatives. He then proved that one\ncould not construct a social preference that satisfied all three\naxioms; the Pareto criterion and minimal liberty conflict.\n\nThe Arrovian framework, however, does not present the ideal\nenvironment in which to study minimal liberty. An agent may have the\nright (or in Hohfeldian terms a privilege) to determine a social\ndecision. Typically, though, he need not exercise his right. Or the\nagent may be willing to trade or waive his right in exchange for some\nbenefit. Gibbard [1974] argued that the power to waive one\u2019s\nrights undermined Sen\u2019s claim. Subsequent authors then\nreformulated Sen\u2019s argument within a more suitable, game\ntheoretic framework. See, e.g., Deb, Pattanaik and Razzolini [1997].\nThe conflict thus persists in a more plausible and appealing formal\nframework. \n\nIn Hohfeld\u2019s taxonomy of legal rights, a legal duty is the jural\ncorrelate of a legal right. We might similarly consider responsibility\nthe ethical correlate of liberty within the conceptual framework of\nautonomy. Recent formal work has shown that this aspect of autonomy\nalso conflicts with the Pareto criterion. \n\nSen defined autonomy as liberty understood as freedom to choose.\nAutonomy as responsibility for one\u2019s choices and actions\nrepresents the obverse side of this freedom to choose. Political\nphilosophers have examined this issue in their study of distributive\njustice. Rawls [1971] famously argued that individuals were not\nresponsible for their innate talents. Dworkin [1981] extended this\nargument through his distinction between \u201cbrute luck\u201d and\n\u201coption luck\u201d. Distributive justice in both arguments\nrequired insurance against bad realization of risks of \u201cbrute\nluck\u201d but responsibility for the bad realizations of option\nluck.\n\nWithin economics, the study of responsibility has emerged from the\nliterature initiated by Duncan Foley [1967] and Hal Varian [1974] on\nfairness. An allocation is fair if and only if it is Pareto efficient\nand envy-free. An allocation is envy-free if no individual would\nprefer the outcome assigned to another individual to the outcome\nassigned to her. In an exchange economy, a competitive equilibrium\nthat results from an initial, equal allocation of resources is both\nPareto efficient and envy-free because each individual has the same\nset of options available to her. The competitive equilibrium is thus\nfair. \n\nIn a production economy, however, a similar argument will fail if\nindividuals have different talents. The argument fails for two\nreasons. First, talents are not transferable though, of course, we may\ntransfer money between agents. Second, when two individuals have\nunequal talents, they face different sets of feasible options. The\nmore talented have better options and hence do better. The less\ntalented may envy them. As a consequence, no efficient and envy-free\nequilibrium exists. \n\nThese arguments apply to the more abstract concerns of distributive\njustice and responsibility. The no-envy test outlined above combines\ntwo distinct ideas. First, individuals with identical attributes for\nwhich they are responsible should have identical well-being. Second,\nindividuals with identical characteristics for which they are not\nresponsible should receive identical compensation for their losses.\nThe first condition addresses option luck; the second brute luck. \n\nFleurbaey [2008] comprehensively explores the tensions between these\ntwo aspects of the no-envy test and between the no-envy test and the\nPareto criterion. The compatibility of these two conditions depends on\nthe nature of the correlation of these effects of brute and option\nluck on the agent\u2019s well-being. If the well-being of agents with\nbad luck is unusually responsive to their bad luck, no fair allocation\nexists. The requirements of no-envy and the Pareto criterion again\nconflict. \n\nWe now turn to a third aspect of autonomy, self-governance. In the\ncontext of collective action, self-governance refers to democratic\ngovernance. The vast literature on social choice theory investigates\nthe relation of self-governance to the Pareto criterion in this\ncontext. \n\nVarious assumptions reflect the value of democratic governance in this\nliterature. The most minimal assumption is non-dictatorship. We may\ninterpret Arrow\u2019s initial result as demonstrating, for direct\ndemocracy, a complex incompatibility between the Pareto criterion and\nseveral other axioms including non-dictatorship, the axiom of minimal\nself-governance. The complexity arises because we cannot easily\ndetermine which of the several axioms is most fundamental. The\nliterature, for example, has investigated the importance of the axiom\nof independence of irrelevant alternatives more thoroughly than the\nPareto criterion. This emphasis perhaps reflects the strong appeal of\nthe Pareto criterion. \n\nRepresentative democracy, however, presents the conflict more starkly.\nIn modern society, communal self-governance generally operates through\nrepresentative institutions. Individuals do not directly enact\nsubstantive legislative programs. Rather, they elect representatives\nto legislatures that then enact substantive legislative programs.\nPhrased differently, election procedures are candidate-based rather\nthan assembly-based or program-based. Notice that this distinction\npersists even in those states that have adopted party-list\nproportional representation schemes. In these schemes, an individual\nvotes for a party rather than an individual candidate that has\nendorsed a specific program. The election determines the party\ncomposition of the legislature. Each contesting party then constitutes\na candidate. \n\nThese candidate-based procedures, however, are inconsistent with the\nminimal demands of communal self-governance. Benoit and Kornhauser\n[2010] have proven that the only Pareto efficient, candidate-based\nprocedure is a dictatorship. Again the Pareto criterion conflicts with\na (minimal) requirement of communal self-governance or autonomy.\n",
