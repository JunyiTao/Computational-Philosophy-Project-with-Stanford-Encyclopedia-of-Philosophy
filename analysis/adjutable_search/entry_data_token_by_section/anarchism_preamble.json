    "main_text": "\n\nAnarchism is a political theory that is skeptical of the justification\nof authority and power. Anarchism is usually grounded in moral claims\nabout the importance of individual liberty, often conceived as freedom\nfrom domination. Anarchists also offer a positive theory of human\nflourishing, based upon an ideal of equality, community, and\nnon-coercive consensus building. Anarchism has inspired practical\nefforts at establishing utopian communities, radical and revolutionary\npolitical agendas, and various forms of direct action. This entry\nprimarily describes \u201cphilosophical anarchism\u201d: it focuses\non anarchism as a theoretical idea and not as a form of political\nactivism. While philosophical anarchism describes a skeptical theory\nof political legitimation, anarchism is also a concept that has been\nemployed in philosophical and literary theory to describe a sort of\nanti-foundationalism. Philosophical anarchism can mean either a theory\nof political life that is skeptical of attempts to justify state\nauthority or a philosophical theory that is skeptical of the attempt\nto assert firm foundations for knowledge.\n",
