    "main_text": "Modality and the causal relation || Avicenna\u2019s necessitation thesis\n3.1 Avicenna\u2019s necessitation thesis\n\nOne striking feature of Arabic and Islamic accounts of causation is\nthe use of the modal terms \u201cnecessary\u201d and\n\u201cpossible\u201d to analyze the causal relation. This practice\nis especially prominent in Avicenna\u2019s discussions of causality,\nwhich emphasize his necessitation thesis: \u201cwith the existence of\nits cause, the existence an effect is necessary\u201d. Although\nAvicenna does not employ this thesis to restrict the scope of causal\npower to God, his necessitation thesis appears to have played a role\nin the history of occasionalism insofar as it is a target of\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s \u201cno necessary connection\u201d\nargument, which is discussed below (in\n \u00a73.2).\n\nIn the Metaphysics of the Book of Healing, Avicenna\ndefends the necessitation thesis in order to support his coexistence\nthesis, which states that cause and effect coexist in time. In other\nwords, Avicenna considers the necessitation thesis to entail that the\npriority of cause to effect is ontological, not temporal (Marmura\n1981a).\n\nIn the central part of the argument for the necessitation thesis,\nAvicenna attempts to show that the causal relation cannot be fully\nunderstood in terms of possibility:\n\n\n[What happens] has the possibility of happening and the possibility of\nnot happening. It is not insofar as its happening is possible that it\nexists. And it is not only insofar as something else has the\npossibility of making it happen that it exists from another. Having\nthe possibility of making a thing happen is not sufficient for making\nit happen. Given the mere possibility of making a thing happen, which\nis not sufficient, the thing would sometimes exist when it exists and\nsometimes not exist when it exists. [\u2026] But something that has\nthe very same relationship to a thing\u2019s existing from it as to\nits not existing from it has no greater claim to be the thing\u2019s\ncause than not to be its cause. Indeed, sound reason demands that\nthere be a state that differentiates between the thing\u2019s\nexisting from it and its not existing from it. (Avicenna MH:\n126\u20137, trans. modified)\n\n\nIn this argument, Avicenna analyzes an event as follows: considered in\nitself, the event may exist or not exist; and, considered in relation\nto what has the mere possibility of making it happen, the event may\nexist or not exist. So, considered in either of these ways, the event\nmay or may not exist: its existence or nonexistence hangs in the\nbalance. He then asserts that the existence or nonexistence of one\nthing from another requires a difference-maker, which destroys this\nequilibrium. To support this conclusion, he appeals to a version of\nthe Principle of Sufficient Reason, which states that, for everything\nthat exists from another, there is a sufficient reason why it exists\nfrom that other rather than does not exist from that other. He then\nlinks the Principle of Sufficient Reason to the notion of\n\u201ccause\u201d: by \u201ccause\u201d we mean not what has the\nmere possibility of making something happen, but rather what is\nsufficient to make it happen (Richardson 2014). On the basis of this\nargument, Avicenna ultimately concludes that, with the existence of\nits cause, the existence of the effect is not merely possible, it is\nnecessary.\n\nAvicenna considers this account of \u201ccause\u201d to apply to all\ninstances of the causal relation. Still, he recognizes important\ndifferences across the various things which function as causes. Most\nimportant are the differences between God and sublunary substance.\nAccording to Avicenna, with God\u2019s existence, the existence of\nhis sole immediate effect, the first intelligence, is necessary. His\nreasoning involves the following ideas. First, God needs nothing\noutside himself to produce the first intelligence. Second, God is\nimmutable. Avicenna considers God\u2019s immutability to entail that\nhis knowledge and volition are also immutable. God\u2019s knowledge\nand volition are the principles by which he acts. So, whenever God\nexists, he possesses the knowledge and volition by which he produces\nthe first intelligence. So, with God\u2019s existence, the existence\nof the first intelligence is necessary.\n\nBy contrast, with the existence of a sublunary substance, the\nexistence of its effect is typically not necessary, but merely\npossible. A sublunary substance is a subject of causality\n(maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bf al-\u02bfill\u012byah). Whenever a\nsubject of causality is in a state that differentiates between a\nthing\u2019s existing from it and its not existing from it,\n\n\n[t]he effect would then proceed from it necessarily, regardless of\nwhether [the differentiating state] is an act of will, appetite, or\nanger, or something originated, natural or otherwise, or some external\nthing. (Avicenna MH: 127, trans. modified)\n\n\nThus, a subject of causality is a substance that functions as a cause\nwhen it is in a certain state. For example, fire functions as a cause\nfor the burning of cotton when its power to burn is actualized in the\ncotton. This state occurs only when contact between agent (fire) and\npatient (cotton) is unimpeded and when the patient (cotton) is itself\nin a suitable state, e.g., the cotton is not wet.\n",
