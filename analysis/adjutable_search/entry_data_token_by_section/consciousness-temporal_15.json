Given this it is not surprising\nto find a number of writers proposing hybrid models\nwhich\u2014in differing ways\u2014contain elements of both.\n\nIn his Scientific Thought (1923) C.D. Broad writes:\n\n\nThere is no doubt that sensible motion and rest are genuine\nunanalysable properties of visual sensa. I am aware of them as\ndirectly as I am aware of the redness of a red patch (1923: 287)\n\n\na clear commitment to realism. Later in the same work, in a much-cited\npassage he elaborates thus:\n\n\n\u2026 it is a notorious fact that we do not merely notice that\nsomething has moved or otherwise changed; we also often see\nsomething moving or changing. This happens if we\nlook at the second-hand of a watch or look at a flickering flame.\nThese are experiences of a quite unique kind; we could no more\ndescribe what we sense in them to a man who had never had such\nexperiences than we could describe a red colour to a man born blind.\n(1923: 351)\n\n\nThe account of the structure of temporal consciousness Broad went on\nto develop in Scientific Thought is of a distinctive kind. It\nis built on acts of awareness that are themselves momentary but which\napprehend contents distributed over a short interval of time. For\nBroad a stream of consciousness consists of dense sequences of\nmomentary acts and extended contents, with the consequence that the\ncontents apprehended by neighbouring acts largely overlap. For anyone\nwho holds that consciousness has an awareness-content structure\nBroad\u2019s basic approach may well look quite promising\u2014and\nmany direct realists as well as sense-datum theorists fall into this\ncategory. The sort of overlap Broad envisages is shown in\n Figure 6.1,\n where three momentary acts A1, A2, and A3 apprehend a succession of\nauditory tones C-D-E-F, with each act able to apprehend two adjoining\ntones.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1 C.D. Broad's Theory. [An\n extended description of Figure 6.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nBroad\u2019s theory has its merits, but it also gives rise to some\nproblems and puzzles. Let\u2019s suppose that during the experiencing\nof the D-tone a brief flash of light is also experienced\u2014in\n Figure 6.2\n below the flash is represented by the asterisk shape. This flash\nfalls under A1, and so is experienced by that awareness; it also falls\nunder A2, and so is experienced by that awareness. Hence the problem:\nit looks as though the flash is experienced twice, when in reality it\nwould be experienced only once. In fact the situation is far worse,\nbecause in Broad\u2019s model there are many additional momentary\napprehensions occurring between A1 and A2, each creating a different\nexperience. As Mabbott puts it:\n\n\nNothing in my direct experience confirms this repetition. If it\noccurred it would obviously make listening to music or to continuous\nsentences a matter of the greatest complexity and difficulty. (Mabbott\n1951: 161)\n\n\nDainton (2000 [2006: 141]) also suggests that Broad\u2019s account is\nafflicted by a problem of \u201crepeated contents\u201d.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2 Repetitions and Divergences.\n[An\n extended description of Figure 6.2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nA further problem stems from the fact that on Broad\u2019s account\nthe periods during which we are continuously aware of contents can\nhave a greater temporal extension than the contents themselves.\nReturning to\n Figure 6.2\n the experience of the flash unfold over the very brief interval\ne shown in the diagram. The duration d stretches\nfrom A1 to A2 and corresponds to the entire period of time the subject\nwas aware of the flash. As can be seen the interval d is\nconsiderably longer than e. Since contents that are\napprehended by acts of awareness appear to be present, this means\nthat\u2014if Broad\u2019s account is correct\u2014brief events are\nexperienced as present for considerably longer periods than they\nactually are present. By allowing us to experience an interval in an\ninstant (or something close to it) Broad renders temporal experience\nincapable of accurately reflecting the temporal properties of the\nevents we perceive. If our experience were misleading in this\nsort of way it is difficult to believe we would not notice. For\nfurther discussion of these aspects of Broad\u2019s model see Dainton\n(2000 [2006: 6.2]), Tye (2003), Phillips (2010) and Rashbrook (2012,\n2017).\n",
