    "main_text": "A Particular Intensional Logic || Problems With Rigidity\n3.6 Problems With Rigidity\nIt was noted that for rigid terms the de re/de dicto distinction\ncollapses. Indeed, if \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are rigid, \\([\\lambda xy\\\nx=y](f, g)\\), \\({\\square}[\\lambda xy\\ x=y](f, g)\\) and \\([\\lambda xy\\\n{\\square}x=y](f, g)\\) are all equivalent. This is a problem that sets\na limit on what can be handled by the Carnap-style logic as presented\nso far. Two well-known areas of difficulty are mathematics and proper\nnames, especially in an epistemic setting.\n3.6.1 Mathematical Problems\nHow could someone not know that \\(1 + 4 = 2 + 3\\)? Yet it happens\nfor small children, and for us bigger children similar, but more\ncomplex, examples of mathematical truths we don\u2019t know can be\nfound. Obviously the designations of \u201c\\(1 + 4\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(2 + 3\\)\u201d are the same, so their senses must be\ndifferent. But if we model sense by a function from states to\ndesignations, the functions would be the same, mapping each state to\n5. If it is necessary truth that is at issue, there is no problem; we\ncertainly want that \\(1 + 4 = 2 + 3\\) is a necessary truth. But if\nepistemic issues are under consideration, since we cannot have a\npossible world in which \u201c\\(1 + 4\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(2 +\n3\\)\u201d designate different things, \u201c\\(1 + 4 = 2 + 3\\)\u201d\nmust be a known truth. So again, how could one not know this, or any\nother mathematical truth?\nOne possible solution is to say that for mathematical terms,\nintension is a different thing than it is for definite descriptions\nlike \u201cthe King of France.\u201d The expression \u201c\\(1 +\n4\\)\u201d is a kind of miniature computing program. Exactly what\nprogram depends on how we were taught to add, but let us standardize\non: \\(x + y\\) instructs us to start at the number \\(x\\) and count off\nthe next \\(y\\) numbers. Then obviously, \u201c\\(1 + 4\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(2 + 3\\)\u201d correspond to different programs with the same\noutput. We might identify the program with the sense, and the output\nwith the denotation. Then we might account for not knowing that \\(1 +\n4 = 2 + 3\\) by saying we have not executed the two programs, and so\ncan\u2019t conclude anything about the output.\nIdentifying the intension of a mathematical term with its\ncomputational content is a plausible thing to do. It does, however,\nclash with what came earlier in this article. Expressions like\n\u201cthe King of France\u201d get treated one way, expressions like\n\u201c\\(1 + 4\\)\u201d another. For any given expression, how do we\ndecide which way to treat it? It is possible to unify all this. Here\nis one somewhat simple-minded way. If we think of the sense of\n\u201c\\(1 + 4\\)\u201d as a small program, there are certainly\nstates, possible worlds, in which we have not executed the program,\nand others in which we have. We might, then, think of the intension of\n\u201c\\(1 + 4\\)\u201d as a partial function on states, whose domain\nis the set of states in which the instructions inherent in \u201c\\(1\n+ 4\\)\u201d have been executed, and mapping those states to 5. Then,\nclearly, we can have states of an epistemic possible world model in\nwhich we do not know that \u201c\\(1 + 4\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(2 +\n3\\)\u201d have the same outputs.\nThis can be pushed only so far. We might be convinced by some\ngeneral argument that addition is a total function always\ndefined. Then it is conceivable that we might know \u201c\\(1 +\n4\\)\u201d designates some number, but not know what it is. But this\ncannot be captured using the semantics outlined thus far, assuming\narithmetic terms behave correctly. If at some state we know \\(\\exists\nx([\\lambda y\\ x = y](1 + 4))\\), that is, we know \u201c\\(1 +\n4\\)\u201d designates, then at all compatible states, \u201c\\(1 +\n4\\)\u201d designates, and since arithmetic terms behave correctly, at\nall compatible states \u201c\\(1 + 4\\)\u201d must designate 5, and\nhence we must know \\([\\lambda y\\ 5 = y](1 + 4)\\) at the original\nstate. We cannot know \u201c\\(1 + 4\\)\u201d designates without\nknowing what.\nIt is also possible to address the problem from quite a different\ndirection. One does not question the necessity of mathematical\ntruths\u2014the issue is an epistemic one. And for this, it has long\nbeen noted that a Hintikka-style treatment of knowledge does not deal\nwith actual knowledge, but with potential knowledge\u2014not what we\nknow, but what we are entitled to know. Then familiar logical\nomniscience problems arise, and we have just seen yet another\ninstance of them. A way out of this was introduced in Fagin and\nHalpern 1988, called awareness logic. The idea was to enrich\nHintikka\u2019s epistemic models with an awareness function, mapping\neach state to the set of formulas we are aware of at that state. The\nidea was that an awareness function reflects some bound on the\nresources we can bring to bear. With such semantical machinery, we\nmight know simple mathematical truths but not more complex ones,\nsimply because they are too complex for us.\nAwareness, in this technical sense, is a blunt instrument. A\nrefinement was suggested in van Benthem 1991: use explicit\nknowledge terms. As part of a project to provide a constructive\nsemantics for intuitionistic logic, a formal logic of explicit proof\nterms was presented in Artemov 2001. Later a possible world semantics\nfor it was created in Fitting 2006. In this logic truths are known for\nexplicit reasons, and these explicit reasons provide a measure of\ncomplexity. The work was subsequently extended to a more general family\nof justification logics, which are logics of knowledge in\nwhich reasons are made explicit.\nIn justification logics, instead of the familiar \\(KX\\) of\nepistemic logic we have \\(t{:}X\\), where \\(t\\) is an explicit\njustification term. The formula \\(t{:}X\\) is read,\n\u201c\\(X\\) is known for reason \\(t\\).\u201d Justification terms\nhave structure which varies depending on the particular justification\nlogic being investigated. Common to all justification logics is the\nfollowing minimal machinery. First there are justification constants,\nintended to be unanalyzed justifications of accepted logical\ntruths. Second, there are justification variables, standing for\narbitrary justifications. And finally there are binary operations,\nminimally \\(\\cdot\\) and \\(+\\). The intention is that if \\(s\\)\njustifies \\(X \\supset Y\\) and \\(t\\) justifies \\(X\\), then \\(s\\cdot\nt\\) justifies \\(Y\\), and also \\(s+t\\) justifies anything that \\(s\\)\njustifies and also anything that \\(t\\) justifies. There are very close\nconnections between justification logics and epistemic logics,\nembodied in Realization Theorems. This is not the appropriate\nplace to go into details; a thorough discussion of justification\nlogics can be found in this encyclopedia's entry on justification logic.\nIf one follows the justification logic approach one might say, of\n\\(1 + 4 = 2 + 3\\) or some more complicated mathematical truth, that it\nis knowable but too hard for us to actually know. That is, the\njustification terms embodying our reasons for this knowledge are too\ncomplex for us. This follows the general idea of awareness logic, but\nwith a specific and mathematically useful measure of the complexity of\nour awareness.\n3.6.2 Proper Names\nProper names are even more of a problem than mathematical\nexpressions. These days proper names are generally understood to be\nrigid designators but, unlike mathematical terms, they have no\nstructure that we can make use of. Here is a very standard\nexample. Suppose \u201cHesperus\u201d is used as a name for the\nevening star, and \u201cPhosphorus\u201d for the morning star. It\nshould be understood that \u201cthe evening star\u201d is\nconventional shorthand for a definite description, \u201cthe first\nheavenly body seen after sunset\u201d and similarly for \u201cthe\nmorning star\u201d. Definite descriptions have structure, they pick\nout objects and in different possible worlds they may pick out\ndifferent objects. But proper names are not like that. Once the\ndesignations of \u201cHesperus\u201d and \u201cPhosphorus\u201d are\nfixed\u2014as it happens they both name the planet Venus\u2014that\ndesignation is fixed across possible worlds and so they are rigid\ndesignators. It follows that while the morning star is the evening\nstar, that identity is not necessary because definite descriptions are\nnot rigid, but Hesperus is Phosphorus and that identity is a necessary\none. How, then, could the identity of Hesperus and Phosphorus not be a\nknown truth, known without doing any astronomical research?\nThere is more than one solution of the dilemma just mentioned. One\nway is very simple indeed. Possible world models can be used to\nrepresent various kinds of modalities. They provide mathematical\nmachinery, but they do not say what the machinery is for. That is up\nto the user. So, we might want to have such a model to represent\nnecessary truth, or we might want to have such a model to represent\nepistemic issues. The argument that proper names are rigid designators\napplies to models representing necessary truth. It does not follow\nthat this is the case for epistemic models too. Here is a quote from\n(Kripke 1980) that sheds some light on the issue.\n\nBut being put in a situation where we have exactly the same\nevidence, qualitatively speaking, it could have turned out that\nHesperus was not Phosphorus; that is, in a counterfactual world in\nwhich \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 were not\nused in the way that we use them, as names of this planet, but as\nnames of some other objects, one could have had qualitatively\nidentical evidence and concluded that \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 named two different objects. But we, using\nthe names as we do right now, can say in advance, that if Hesperus and\nPhosphorus are one and the same, then in no other possible world can\nthey be different. We use \u2018Hesperus\u2019 as the name of a\ncertain body and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 as the name of a certain\nbody. We use them as names of these bodies in all possible worlds. If,\nin fact, they are the same body, then in any other possible\nworld we have to use them as a name of that object. And so in any\nother possible world it will be true that Hesperus is Phosphorus. So\ntwo things are true: first, that we do not know a priori that\nHesperus is Phosphorus, and are in no position to find out the answer\nexcept empirically. Second, this is so because we could have evidence\nqualitatively indistinguishable from the evidence we have and\ndetermine the reference of the two names by the positions of two\nplanets in the sky, without the planets being the same.\n\nIn short, proper names are rigid designators in models where the\npossible worlds represent logically alternative states. They need not\nbe rigid designators in models where the possible worlds represent\nepistemically alternative states. Hesperus and Phosphorus are the\nsame, necessarily so, but we could have used the names\n\u201cHesperus\u201d and \u201cPhosphorus\u201d differently\nwithout being able to tell we were doing so\u2014a state in which we\ndid this might be epistemically indistinguishable from the actual\none. There can be necessary identities that we do not know because\nnecessary truth and known truth do not follow the same rules.\n3.6.3 Non-Carnapian Approaches\nThe formal machinery behind the discussion above traces back to\nideas of Carnap. In this tradition possible worlds are central, and\nsense or intension is a function from possible worlds to\ndenotations. Senses determine denotations, but detailed machinery\naccounting for how this happens is not made concrete (except for\ndefinite descriptions). One need not do things this way. If the Church\napproach is followed, one can simply say that \u201cHesperus\u201d\nand \u201cPhosphorus\u201d have the same designation rigidly, hence\nnecessarily, but even so they do not have the same sense. This is\npossible because senses are, in effect, independent and not derived\nthings. Senses can determine the same extension across possible worlds\nwithout being identical.\nA logic breaking the Carnapian mold, that is thorough and fully\ndeveloped, can be found in Zalta 1988. In this a class of abstract\nobjects is postulated, some among them being ordinary. A distinction\nis made between an object exemplifying a property\nand encoding it. For instance, an abstract object might\nperfectly well encode the property of being a round square, but could\nnot exemplify it. A general comprehension principle is assumed, in the\nform that conditions determine abstract individuals that encode (not\nexemplify) the condition. Identity is taken to hold between objects if\nthey are both abstract and encode the same properties, or they are\nboth ordinary and exemplify the same properties. In effect, this deals\nwith problems of substitutivity. The formal theory (more properly,\ntheories) is quite general and includes both logical necessity and\ntemporal operators. It is assumed that encoding is not contingent,\nthough exemplifying may be, and thus properties have both an\nexemplification extension that can vary across worlds, and an encoding\nextension that is rigid. With all this machinery available, a detailed\ntreatment of proper names can be developed, along with much else.\n",
