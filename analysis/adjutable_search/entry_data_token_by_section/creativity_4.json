    "main_text": "What is Creativity? || Is creativity a virtue?\n2.3 Is creativity a virtue?\n\nHaving considered what is required for something to count as a\ncreative product, and whether it must be produced by a\ncertain kind of process, we now turn to analysis of the\ncreative person.\n\nSome theorists suggest that creativity, as an attribute of persons, is\nan ability to perform creative acts or produce creative things (Boden\n2004). Others argue, however, that creativity isn\u2019t merely an\nability. An ability is something you can possess without ever putting\nit to use. You might have the ability to learn Swahili, for example,\nwithout ever making the effort to learn that language, despite having\nample opportunities to do so. Creativity is different in this regard.\nIf someone has the ability to be creative but never uses that ability\nwhen given numerous chances to do so, we would not call that person\ncreative. Creative people are not merely able to act creatively. They\nare, moreover, disposed to exercise that ability, such that they do\nact creatively, at least some of the time, when the occasion arises.\nOn this view creativity is a disposition, also referred to as\na trait (Grant 2012; cf. B. Gaut 2014b, 2018).\n\nPhilosophers have long distinguished virtues as a special\nsubclass of dispositions or traits. In Western philosophy, the\ntradition of theorizing about virtues goes back to the ancient Greeks,\nand over the last half-century it has enjoyed a renaissance in ethics\n(see entry on\n virtue ethics)\n and, more recently, in epistemology (see entry on\n virtue epistemology)\n and aesthetics (Lopes 2008; Roberts 2018; Hills 2018). Traditional\nexamples of virtues include wisdom, justice, temperance, and courage.\nShould creativity be added to the list?\n\nThe answer depends, of course, on what it means for a trait to be a\nvirtue. At the very least, a virtue is a trait that is good or\nvaluable. So whether creativity counts as a virtue in this minimal\nsense depends on whether creativity is necessarily valuable, a point\nwhich is contested, as we saw in the previous section. In fact, those\nwho contend that creativity isn\u2019t necessarily valuable often do\nso in order to prove that it isn\u2019t a virtue.\n\nBut let\u2019s suppose for the sake of argument that creativity is\nindeed a valuable trait. Is it also a virtue in some more robust\nsense? Virtue theorists commonly take their cue from Aristotle\u2019s\nclassic discussion in the Nichomachean Ethics. Citing justice\nand temperance as paradigm virtues, Aristotle asserts that a trait\nmust meet at least three conditions to count as a virtue:\n\n\nFor actions in accord with the virtues to be done temperately or\njustly it does not suffice that they themselves have the right\nqualities. Rather, the agent must also be in the right state when he\ndoes them. First, he must know [that he is doing virtuous actions];\nsecond he must decide on them, and decide on them for themselves; and\nthrid, he must also do them from a firm and unchanging state.\n(EN II.4, 1105a28\u20131105a33)\n\n\nSo, for example, if you return something you\u2019ve borrowed, that\nact exhibits the virtue of justice if and only if (1) you know that\nyou\u2019re returning what you borrowed, (2) you choose to do so\nbecause it is the just thing to do, and for no other reason, and (3)\nyou are disposed to do the just thing across the range of\ncircumstances when the opportunity arises. In addition to justice and\ntemperance, Aristotle enumerates other ethical virtues like prudence,\ngenerosity, and courage, as well as the intellectual virtue of\ntheoretical wisdom. In his view, each of these traits requires one to\nmeet the three conditions above. While he does not consider whether\ncreativity is a virtue, we may ask whether creativity also has these\nthree criteria. Does one have to meet these three requirements in\norder to count as creative?\n\nWe\u2019ll begin with the third requirement to set it to one side.\nDoes a person\u2019s act count as creative only \u201cif he does it\nfrom a fixed and permanent disposition of character\u201d? Examples\nsuggest otherwise. Consider the poet Arthur Rimbaud, who abandoned\npoetry at the age of 21 to pursue a life of adventure. The fact that\nhe never produced another poem after that does not count against the\nfact that he was a creative poet in his youth (B. Gaut 2014b). Unlike\nthe Aristotelian virtues, then, creativity does not have to be a\npermanent disposition.\n\nEven so, it would still be significant if creativity turned out to be\nlike an Aristotelian virtue in meeting the first two requirements. And\narguably, creativity does meet the first requirement. A person\ndoesn\u2019t count as doing something creative unless \u201che knows\nwhat he is doing\u201d. This was already implied by the agency\ncondition for creativity discussed earlier.\n\nWhere things get interesting is with Aristotle\u2019s second\ncriterion for virtue. In order for your action to count as virtuous,\nhe says, you have to do it \u201cfor its own sake\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nyou have to do it because you value virtue as an end itself, and not\nas a means to some external reward like praise, money, status, fame,\nor winning a competition. Consider the virtue of generosity, for\ninstance. If you give money to someone in need merely because it will\nmake you look good in the eyes of your friends, then you aren\u2019t\nreally being generous. Your act may outwardly look like generosity,\nbut it\u2019s not the real thing. To exhibit real generosity, you\nhave to pursue generosity as an end in itself; you have to help others\njust for the sake of helping others. Now contrast being generous with\nbeing polite. If you compliment your colleague on the good work\nshe\u2019s done, then even if you\u2019re doing this in order to\nmanipulate her, you are being polite to her. You can have an ulterior\nmotive for being polite. So politeness is not a virtue the way\ngenerosity is.\n\nIs creativity a virtue in this respect? That is, does being creative\nrequire acting creatively for its own sake? Matthew Kieran\u2019s\n(2014a, 2014b, 2018) answer is a qualified yes. While he grants that\nyou can be motivated by external rewards to exhibit \u201cminimal\ncreativity\u201d in producing valuable new things, he maintains that\n\u201cexemplary creativity\u201d requires you to be motivated by the\nvalue of creativity itself. Thus, in his view, exemplary creativity is\na virtue.\n\nTo support this claim, Kieran points to a research program in\npsychology which purports to show that creativity is driven by\n\u201cintrinsic motivation\u201d rather than \u201cextrinsic\nmotivation\u201d. A classic experiment in this program is \u201cthe\nmagic markers study\u201d, in which kids end up producing less\ncreative drawings when they are offered a prize (Lepper et al. 1973).\nMany other studies have reported similar results, which lead Teresa\nAmabile to conclude, at first without qualification, that creativity\nis enhances by intrinsic motivation and hampered by extrinsic\nmotivation (Amabile 1983: 107).\n\nFurther research introduced complications. In some studies, subjects\nwere given \u201cimmunization techniques\u201d whereby they were\nfirst primed or trained to focus on intrinsically motivating factors\nlike the pleasure or aesthetical value of engaging in artistic\nactivities, and it was found that when they engaged in those\nactivities afterward, external rewards actually enhanced\ntheir creativity.\n\nAs researchers interpreted these findings, offering reward can support\none\u2019s intrinsic motivation, provided that the reward works\neither to boost one\u2019s sense of agency or to provide useful\nfeedback about what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t. Intrinsic\nmotivation is still what fuels creativity, on this interpretation;\nrewards help only indirectly, when they reinforce intrinsic\nmotivation. This lead Amabile to revise her hypothesis as the\nIntrinsic Motivation Principle (IMP):\n\n\nIntrinsic motivation is conducive to creativity; controlling extrinsic\nmotivation is detrimental to creativity, but informational or enabling\nextrinsic motivation can be conducive, particularly if initial levels\nof intrinsic motivation are high. (1996: 107)\n\n\nKieran takes this as evidence for his claim that creativity, or at\nleast what he calls exemplary creativity, requires intrinsic\nmotivation and is therefore a virtue in that respect.\n\nObjecting to this proposal, Gaut cites evidence that extrinsic\nmotivation is not always detrimental to creativity. In one study,\nstudents in an introductory psychology class came up with more\ncreative short story titles if they were offered a financial reward\n(Eisenberger & Rhodes 2001). In the studies where immunization\ntechniques were used, proponents of IMP argue that rewards enhance\ncreativity only indirectly, by buttressing intrinsic motivation. But\nin this case no such techniques were used, and so it seems the\nprospect of a reward enhanced creativity directly.\n\nFurther, Gaut argues that this point coheres with the role that\nrewards seem to play in so many real-world cases of creative\nachievement. In their quest to discover the structure of the DNA\nmolecule, Watson and Crick were driven \u201cto imitate Linus Pauling\nand beat him at his own game\u201d (Watson 1968 [1999: 46]). Picasso\nand Matisse were both spurred on by their rivalry with each other\n(Flam 2003: 37). Paul McCready says he was driven to invent his\naward-winning human-powered glider in 1977 because he needed the\nprize-money to pay off his debts:\n\n\nI felt that I didn\u2019t have the time to mess with such things, but\nI had this strong economic motivation to take an interest in\nman-powered flight, so I charged around trying to figure out a way to\nsolve it. (quoted in Sternberg & Lubart 1995: 242)\n\n\nOne historian argues that in World War II the Poles beat the French in\ncracking the Germans\u2019 Enigma Code because they were more\nterrified of German invasion (Singh 1999: ch. 4). Gaut quips:\n\u201cFear of death is a more powerful motivator than the intrinsic\nsatisfactions of code breaking\u201d (Gaut 2014b: 196).\n\nFinally, Gaut points out that even if IMP is true, it is only a\ncausal, probabilistic claim: intrinsic motivation is\n\u201cconducive\u201d to creativity; extrinsic motivation is\n\u201cdetrimental\u201d. But for a trait to be a virtue, intrinsic\nmotivation must be conceptually necessary for the exercise of\nthat trait. If we learn that someone gave to charity just to enhance\nhis reputation, we conclude that he wasn\u2019t really being\ngenerous. By contrast, if we discover that someone created gorgeous\nartwork just for the fame and glory, we may then lose some of our\nadmiration for her creativity, but we do not deny that she was being\ncreative.\n\nKieran could remind us that, in his view, intrinsic motivation is not\nrequired for all creativity, but only for the special form of it that\nhe calls exemplary creativity. Anticipating this reply, Gaut says that\nto distinguish between two forms of creativity is just to concede his\npoint. There are not two forms of generosity, one that requires\nintrinsic motivation and another that does not. If your act of giving\nisn\u2019t motivated by the right kind of reason, then it\ndoesn\u2019t count as an act of generosity at all. Thus, Gaut argues,\nto grant the possibility of non-exemplary creativity is to grant that,\nunlike generosity, creativity isn\u2019t a virtue in the traditional\nAristotelian sense.\n\nAnother way to examine relations between creativity and virtue is\nthrough the lens of virtue epistemology. Linda Zagzebksi defines a\nvirtue\n\n\nas a deep and enduring acquired excellence of a person, involving a\ncharacteristic motivation to produce a certain desired end and\nreliable success in bringing about that end. (1997: 137,\nitalics added)\n\n\nWhile there is a lot packed into this definition, what we\u2019ll\npinpoint here is the idea that virtue involves reliable success in\nachieving a desired end, and that the agent who is epistemically\nvirtuous, in particular, is one who is reliably successful in\nachieving knowledge. Knowledge requires truth, of course, so an\nepistemic virtue is a trait that is \u201ctruth-conducive\u201d.\nEpistemologists typically regard a process as truth-conducive to the\nextent that the beliefs it produces are more often true than false.\nBut Zagzebksi proposes that a process or trait may be truth-conducive\nin a different sense, insofar as it is necessary for advancing\nknowledge in some area, even if it produces a very small proportion of\ntrue beliefs. Creativity, she claims, is truth-conducive in this\nsense, and thus it qualifies as an epistemic virtue (1997: 182). Also\nnote the emphasis on agency. In contrast to contemporary western\nepistemology, virtue epistemology identifies the agent (rather than,\nsay her beliefs) as the essential locus of epistemic valence; it is\nthe agent who is epistemically good (or not). This emphasis comports\nwell with the proposal, discussed above, that the creator\u2019s\nagency is necessary for genuine creative achievement. A\nvirtue-theoretic approach thus illuminates what may (as we will\ndiscuss again later) be essential to creativity, namely, a process\nthat non-trivially involves a responsible agent.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that even after we fix a specific referent for the\nterm \u201ccreative\u201d\u2014whether it be a person, process, or\nproduct\u2014there are lively disagreements about what it means.\nThese debates often seem to presuppose that the term always expresses\nthe same concept, for which we can seek necessary and sufficient\nconditions. But we\u2019ve also seen that some theorists distinguish\nbetween different concepts of creativity, corresponding to different\nsenses of the term \u201ccreative\u201d. In future work we may see\ntheorists develop such pluralistic approaches in more detail. The\ntrick, though, will be to give principled reasons for multiplying\ndifferent concepts of creativity so that the analyses do not simply\nreduce to saying that anything goes.\n",
