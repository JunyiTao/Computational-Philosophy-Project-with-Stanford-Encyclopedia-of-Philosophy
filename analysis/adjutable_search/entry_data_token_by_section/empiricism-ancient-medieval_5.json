    "main_text": "Ancient Empiricism\n3. Ancient Empiricism\n\nThe discussion that follows will employ these categories in order to\nanalyse the thought of ancient and medieval philosophers. Once again,\nthis may be thought to run the risk of anachronism, insofar as such\ncategories are not themselves ancient. Although one school of ancient\nthinkers did identify themselves as empiricists, no ancient or\nmedieval philosophers distinguished the three forms of empiricism I\nhave described. But this is not a fatal objection. We must be careful\nnot to distort the thinking of ancient or medieval philosophers by\nforcing it into modern categories, as into a Procrustean bed. Nor\nshould we write intellectual history in a \u201cWhiggish\u201d\nfashion, interested only in those features of ancient thought that\nanticipate our own. But as Allen Wood once remarked (a little too\nparadoxically), \u201cpeople can mean things they can\u2019t think,\nand therefore \u2026 must be able to express thoughts they\ncan\u2019t have\u201d (A. Wood 2002: 227). When it comes to ancient\nand medieval philosophers, our modern categories can help highlight\naspects of their thought they themselves may never have made\nexplicit.\n",
