Textual Traditions\n\n\nThe discovery of two Laozi silk manuscripts at Mawangdui,\nnear Changsha, Hunan province in 1973 marks an important milestone in\nmodern Laozi research. The manuscripts, identified simply as\n\u201cA\u201d (jia) and \u201cB\u201d (yi), were\nfound in a tomb that was sealed in 168 B.C.E. The texts themselves can\nbe dated earlier, the \u201cA\u201d manuscript being the older of\nthe two, copied in all likelihood before 195 B.C.E. (see Lau 1982,\nBoltz 1984, and Henricks 1989). A documentary on the Mawangdui find\nwas aired on Chinese CCTV-10 in June 2010, which can be viewed from\nits website. The Hunan Provincial Museum website also provides useful\ninformation.\n\n\nBefore this find, access to the Laozi was mainly through the\nreceived text of Wang Bi (226\u2013249 C.E.) and Heshanggong, a\nlegendary figure depicted as a teacher to Emperor Wen\n(r. 179\u2013157 B.C.E.) of the Han dynasty. There are other\nmanuscript versions, but by and large they play a secondary role in\nthe history of the classic.\n\n\nA more recent archaeological find in Guodian, the so-called\n\u201cBamboo-slip Laozi,\u201d which predates the Mawangdui\nmanuscripts, has rekindled debates on the origin and composition of\nthe Laozi. But first, a note on the title and structure of\nthe Daodejing.\n\n\nThe Laozi did not acquire its \u201cclassic\u201d status\nuntil the Han dynasty. According to the Shiji (49.5b), the\nEmpress Dowager Dou\u2014wife of Emperor Wen and mother of Emperor\nJing (r. 156\u2013141 B.C.E.)\u2014was a dedicated student of\nthe Laozi. Later sources added that it was Emperor Jing who\nestablished the text officially as a classic. However, the\ntitle Daodejing appears not to have been widely used until\nlater, toward the close of the Han era.\n\n\nThe Daodejing is also referred to as the Daode\nzhenjing (True Classic of the Way and Virtue), the Taishang\nxuanyuan daodejing (Classic of the Way and Virtue of the Highest\nProfound Origins), and less formally the \u201cfive-thousand\ncharacter\u201d text, on account of its approximate length. Most\nversions exceed five thousand characters by about five to ten percent,\nbut it is interesting to note that numerological considerations later\nbecame an integral part of the history of the work. According to the\nseventh-century Daoist master Cheng Xuanying, it was Ge Xuan (fl. 200\nC.E.), a revered Daoist adept, who shortened the Laozi text\nthat accompanied the Heshanggong commentary to fit the magical number\nof five thousand. This claim cannot be verified, but a number\nof Laozi manuscripts discovered at Dunhuang contain 4,999\ncharacters.\n\n\nThe current Daodejing is divided into two parts\n(pian) and 81 chapters or sections (zhang). Part\none, comprising chapters 1\u201337, has come to be known as\nthe Daojing (Classic of Dao), while chapters 38\u201381 make\nup the Dejing (Classic of Virtue).\n\n \nThis is understood to be a thematic division\u2014chapter 1 begins\nwith the word Dao, while chapter 38 begins with the phrase\n\u201csuperior virtue\u201d\u2014although the concepts of Dao and\nvirtue (de) feature in both parts. As a rough heuristic\nguide, some commentators have suggested that the Daojing is\nmore \u201cmetaphysical,\u201d whereas the Dejing focuses\nmore on sociopolitical issues.\n\n\nIn this context, it is easy to appreciate the tremendous interest\noccasioned by the discovery of the Mawangdui Laozi\nmanuscripts. The two manuscripts contain all the chapters that are\nfound in the current Laozi, although the chapters follow a\ndifferent order in a few places. For example, in both manuscripts, the\nsections that appear as chapters 80 and 81 in the\ncurrent Laozi come immediately after a section that\ncorresponds to chapter 66 of the present text.\n\n\nBoth the Mawangdui \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d manuscripts are\nsimilarly divided into two parts, but in contrast with the current\nversion, in reverse order; i.e., both manuscripts begin with\nthe Dejing, corresponding to chapter 38 of the received\ntext. \u201cPart one\u201d of the \u201cB\u201d manuscript ends\nwith the editorial notation, \u201cVirtue, 3,041 [characters],\u201d\nwhile the last line of \u201cPart two\u201d reads: \u201cDao,\n2,426.\u201d Does this mean that the classic should be renamed,\nfrom Daodejing to \u201cDedaojing\u201d (Classic\nof Virtue and the Way)? One scholar, in fact, has adopted the\ntitle Dedaojing (Te-Tao ching) for his translation\nof the Mawangdui Laozi (Henricks 1989).\n\n\nIt seems unlikely that the Mawangdui arrangement stems simply from\nscribal idiosyncrasy or happenstance\u2014e.g., that the copyist, in\nwriting out the Laozi on silk, had made use of an original\ntext in bamboo slips and just happened to start with a bundle of slips\ncontaining the Dejing (Yan 1976, 12, explains how this is\npossible). If the order is deliberate, does it imply that the\n\u201coriginal\u201d Laozi gives priority to sociopolitical\nissues? This raises important questions for interpretation.\n\n\nThe division into 81 chapters reflects numerological interest and is\nassociated particularly with the Heshanggong version, which also\ncarries chapter titles. It was not universally accepted until much\nlater, perhaps the Tang period, when the text was standardized under\nthe patronage of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712\u2013756). Traditional\nsources report that some versions were divided into 64, 68, or 72\nchapters; and some did not have chapter divisions (Henricks 1982).\n\n\nThe Mawangdui \u201cA\u201d manuscript contains in some places a dot\nor \u201cperiod\u201d that appears to signal the beginning of a\nchapter. The earlier Guodian texts (see below) are not divided into\ntwo parts, but in many places they employ a black square mark to\nindicate the end of a section. The sections or chapters so marked\ngenerally agree with the division in the present Laozi. Thus,\nalthough the 81-chapter formation may be relatively late, some attempt\nat chapter division seems evident from an early stage of the textual\nhistory of the Daodejing.\n\n\nUntil about two decades ago, the Mawangdui manuscripts held the pride\nof place as the oldest extant manuscripts of the Laozi. In\nlate 1993, the excavation of a tomb (identified as M1) in Guodian,\nJingmen city, Hubei province, yielded among other things some 800\nbamboo slips, of which 730 are inscribed, containing over 13,000\nChinese characters. Some of these, amounting to about 2,000\ncharacters, match the Laozi (see Allan and Williams 2000, and\nHenricks 2000). The tomb is located near the old capital of the state\nof Chu and is dated around 300 B.C.E. Robbers entered the tomb before\nit was excavated, although the extent of the damage is uncertain.\n\n\nThe bamboo texts, written in a Chu script, have been transcribed into\nstandard Chinese and published under the title Guodian Chumu\nzhujian (Beijing: Wenwu, 1998), which on the basis of the size\nand shape of the slips, calligraphy, and other factors divides\nthe Laozi material into three groups. Group A contains\nthirty-nine bamboo slips, which correspond in whole or in part to the\nfollowing chapters of the present text: 19, 66, 46, 30, 15, 64, 37,\n63, 2, 32, 25, 5, 16, 64, 56, 57, 55, 44, 40 and 9. Groups B and C are\nsmaller, with eighteen (chs. 59, 48, 20, 13, 41, 52, 45, 54) and\nfourteen slips (chs. 17, 18, 35, 31, 64), respectively.\n\n\nOn the whole, the Guodian \u201cbamboo-slip Laozi\u201d is\nconsistent with the received text, although the placement or sequence\nof the chapters is different and there are numerous variant and/or\narchaic characters. Particularly, whereas chapter 19 of the\ncurrent Laozi contains what appears to be a strong attack on\nConfucian ideals\u2014\u201cCut off benevolence (ren),\ndiscard rightness (yi)\u201d\u2014the Guodian\n\u201cA\u201d text directs its readers to \u201ccut off\nartificiality, discard deceit.\u201d This has been taken to suggest\nthat in the course of its transmission, the Laozi has taken\non a more \u201cpolemical\u201d outlook. However, the Guodian\n\u201cC\u201d text indicates that ren and yi arose\nonly after the \u201cGreat Dao\u201d had gone into decline, which\nagrees with chapter 18 of the current Laozi. In other words,\nit would be a hasty assumption that the Guodian texts do not engage in\na critique of some of the key ideas central to the \u201cRu\u201d or\nConfucian tradition.\n\n\nIt is not clear whether the Guodian bamboo manuscripts were copied\nfrom one source and meant to be read as one text divided into three\nparts, whether they were \u201cselections\u201d from a longer\noriginal, or whether they were three different texts copied from\ndifferent sources at different times (for a nuanced discussion, see\nBoltz 1999). There is one important clue, however. The \u201cA\u201d\nand \u201cC\u201d texts give two different versions of what is now\npart of chapter 64 of the Laozi, which suggests that they\ncame from different sources. One scholar at least has suggested a\nchronology to the making of the Guodian Laozi bamboo slips,\nwith the \u201cA\u201d group being the oldest of the three, copied\naround 400 B.C.E. (Ding 2000, 7\u20139).\n\n\nTaking into account all the available evidence, it seems likely that\ndifferent collections of sayings attributed to Laozi expanded and\ngained currency during the fourth century B.C.E. They would have been\nderived from earlier, oral or written sources. During the third\ncentury B.C.E., the Laozi settled more or less into its final\nform. It was then quoted extensively in such works as\nthe Hanfeizi and the \u201couter\u201d and\n\u201cmiscellaneous\u201d chapters of the Zhuangzi, and\nbegan to attract commentarial attention.\n\n\nEven more recently, the growing family of Laozi texts\nwelcomed another new arrival.  In January 2009, Peking University\naccepted a gift of a sizeable collection of inscribed bamboo slips,\nsaid to have been retrieved from overseas. Among them, we find a\nnearly complete version of the Laozi.\n\n\nAlthough the published material to date did not mention any carbon\ndating of the slips, the consensus among the scholars who have worked\nwith them is that they date to the Western Han dynasty. More\nprecisely, based especially on the calligraphic form of the\nwriting\u2014a relatively mature form of the \u201cclerical\u201d\nscript established during the Han period\u2014they have been dated to\nthe second half of the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han (141\u201387\nB.C.E.).\n\n\nLike the Mawangdui silk manuscripts, the Peking University text, now\nreferred to as the \u201cBeida Laozi,\u201d is divided into\ntwo parts. They are titled \u201cLaozi Classic, Part 1\u201d\n(Laozi shang jing) and \u201cLaozi Classic, Part 2\u201d\n(Laozi xia jing). This indicates that not only\nthe Laozi was divided into two parts during the Western Han\nperiod, but also it was accorded the status of a \u201cclassic\u201d\n(jing), which may give some credence to the traditional claim\nthat the Laozi achieved canonical status during the preceding\nreign of Emperor Jing (156\u2013141 B.C.E.).\n\n\nThe Beida Laozi agrees with the Mawangdui manuscripts in\nanother important respect; that is, Part 1 also corresponds to\nchapters 38\u201381 of the current 81-chapter version, or\nthe Dejing, and Part 2, chapters 1\u201337,\nor Daojing. Although this cannot be taken to mean that\nthe Laozi was \u201coriginally\u201d written in that order,\nit may be the case that this was the dominant textual tradition during\nthe Han period. Like the Mawangdui manuscripts, the\nBeida Laozi also records the number of characters at the end\nof each part.\n\n\nIn terms of wording, the Beida Laozi agrees with the\nMawangdui manuscripts in many instances, although in some places it\nagrees rather with that of the received text. For example, whereas\nChapter 22 of the received text describes the sage as a\n\u201cmodel\u201d (shi) for the world, the\nBeida Laozi agrees with the Mawangdui versions in likening\nthe sage more concretely to a \u201cshepherd\u201d\n(mu). However, the Beida text agrees with the standard version\nat the beginning of Chapter 2, as opposed to the shorter formulation\nfound in the Guodian and Mawangdui versions.\n\n\nWhat is equally significant is that the sequence or order of the\nchapters is exactly the same as that in the received Laozi.\nThe difference lies in the division of some of the chapters.  Chapters\n17\u201319 of the received text form one chapter in the\nBeida Laozi. The same is true for chapters 6\u20137, 32\u201333 and\n78\u201379. However, the current chapter 64 appears as two chapters in the\nBeida slips.  Altogether there are 77 chapters.  Each chapter is\nclearly marked, with a round dot at the start, and each chapter starts\non a separate bamboo slip.\n\n\nThe Beida Laozi is almost intact in its entirety, missing\nonly some 60 characters when compared with the received text. While it\noffers fresh glimpses into the development of the text, it does not\nprovide any significant new insight into the meaning of\nthe Laozi. A series of articles on the Peking University\nbamboo slips were published in the journal Wenwu (2011,\nno. 6).  The Beida Laozi was published in December 2012 and\nlaunched in February 2013. Although the majority of scholars accept\nthe authenticity of the find, a notable critic is Xing Wen, who argues\nstrongly that it is a forgery (Xing 2016; for a critical discussion in\nEnglish, see Foster 2017).\n\n\nIn summary, two approaches to the making of the Laozi warrant\nconsideration, for they bear directly on interpretation.\n\n\nA linear \u201cevolutionary\u201d model of textual formation would\nsuggest that the earliest sayings attributed to Laozi address\nprincipally issues of governance, reflecting a deep concern with the\ndecline of Zhou rule. Some of these sayings were preserved in the\nGuodian bamboo texts.\n\n\nOn this view, the Laozi underwent substantial change and grew\ninto a longer and more complex work during the third century B.C.E.,\nbecoming in this process more polemical against the Confucian and\nother schools of thought, and acquiring new material of stronger\nmetaphysical or cosmological interest. The Mawangdui manuscripts were\nbased on this mature version of the Laozi; the original\nemphasis on politics, however, can still be detected in the placement\nof the Dejing before the Daojing. Later versions\nreversed this order and in so doing subsumed politics under a broader\nphilosophical vision of Dao as the beginning and end of all\nbeings.\n\n\nAs distinguished from a linear evolutionary model, what is suggested\nhere is that there were different collections of sayings attributed to\nLaozi, overlapping to some extent but each with its own emphases and\npredilections, inhabiting a particular interpretive context.\n\n\nAlthough some key chapters in the current Laozi that deal\nwith the nature of Dao (e.g., chs. 1, 14) are not found in the Guodian\ncorpus, the idea that the Dao is \u201cborn before heaven and\nearth,\u201d for example, which is found in chapter 25 of the\nreceived text is already present. The critical claim that \u201cbeing\n[you] is born of nonbeing [wu]\u201d in chapter 40\nalso figures in the Guodian \u201cA\u201d text. This seems to argue\nagainst the suggestion that the Laozi, and for that matter\nancient Chinese philosophical works in general, were not interested or\nlacked the ability to engage in abstract philosophic thinking, an\nassumption that sometimes appears to underlie evolutionary approaches\nto the development of Chinese philosophy.\n\n\nAnother Guodian document, given the title \u201cTaiyi\nshengshui\u201d (\u201cThe Great One Gives Birth to the\nWaters,\u201d translated in Ames and Hall 2003; also see Boltz 1999\nand Allan 2003) and which may have formed an integral part of the\nGuodian Laozi \u201cC\u201d text, certainly reflects strong\ninterest in cosmogony and cosmology. The text known as \u201cHeng\nXian,\u201d one of the documents found in the corpus of bamboo slips\nrecovered by the Shanghai Museum in 1994 and which I interpret in the\nsense of that which comes before and determines the created order,\ntestifies further to the active engagement with cosmological and\nmetaphysical questions in early China (Ma Chengyuan 2003; a special\nissue of the journal Dao 12.2, 2013 is devoted to this\nwork).\n\n\nThe Guodian and Mawangdui finds are extremely valuable. They are\nsyntactically clearer than the received text in some instances, thanks\nto the larger number of grammatical particles they\nemploy. Nevertheless, they cannot resolve all the controversies and\nuncertainties surrounding the Laozi. In my view, the nature\nof Dao and the application of Daoist insight to ethics and governance\nprobably formed the twin foci in collections of Laozi sayings from the\nstart. They were then developed in several ways\u2014e.g., some\ncollections were combined; new sayings were added; and explanatory\ncomments, illustrations, and elaboration on individual sayings were\nintegrated into the text. The demand for textual uniformity rose when\nthe Laozi gained recognition, and consequently the different\ntextual traditions eventually gave way to the received text of\nthe Laozi.\n\n\nAs mentioned, the current Laozi on which most reprints,\nstudies and translations are based is the version that comes down to\nus along with the commentaries by Wang Bi and Heshanggong. Three\npoints need to be made in this regard.\n\n\nFirst, technically there are multiple versions of the Wang Bi and\nHeshanggong Laozi\u2014over thirty Heshanggong versions are\nextant\u2014but the differences are on the whole minor. Second, the\nWang Bi and Heshanggong versions are not the same, but they are\nsufficiently similar to be classified as belonging to the same line of\ntextual transmission. Third, the Wang Bi and Heshanggong versions that\nwe see today have suffered change. Prior to the invention of printing,\nwhen each manuscript had to be copied by hand, editorial changes and\nscribal errors are to be expected. In particular, the Laozi\ntext that now accompanies Wang Bi\u2019s commentary bears the imprint of\nlater alteration, mainly under the influence of the Heshanggong\nversion, and cannot be regarded as the Laozi that Wang Bi\nhimself had seen and commented on. Boltz (1985) and Wagner (1989) have\nexamined this question in some detail.\n\n\nThe \u201ccurrent\u201d version refers to the Sibu beiyao\nand the Sibu congkan editions of\nthe Daodejing. (The Sibu beiyao and Sibu\ncongkan are large-scale reproductions of traditional Chinese\ntexts published in the early twentieth century.) The former contains\nthe Wang Bi version and commentary, together with a colophon by the\nSong scholar Chao Yuezhi (1059\u20131129), a second note by Xiong Ke\n(ca. 1111\u20131184), and the Tang scholar Lu Deming\u2019s\n(556\u2013627) Laozi yinyi (Glosses on the Meaning and\nPronunciation of the Laozi). It is a reproduction of the Qing\ndynasty \u201cWuying Palace\u201d edition, which in turn is based on\na Ming edition (see especially Hatano 1979).\n\n\nThe Heshanggong version preserved in the Sibu congkan series\nis taken from the library of the famous bibliophile Qu Yong\n(fl. 1850). According to Qu\u2019s own catalogue, this is a Song dynasty\nversion, published probably after the reign of the emperor Xiaozong\n(r. 1163\u20131189). Older extant Heshanggong versions include two\nincomplete Tang versions and fragments found in Dunhuang.\n\n\nBesides the Guodian bamboo texts, the Mawangdui silk manuscripts, the\nBeida Laozi and the received text of Wang Bi and Heshanggong,\nthere is an \u201cancient version\u201d (guben) edited by\nthe early Tang scholar Fu Yi (fl. 600). Reportedly, this version was\nrecovered from a tomb in 574 C.E., whose occupant was a consort of the\nChu general Xiang Yu (d. 202 B.C.E.), the rival of Liu Bang before the\nlatter emerged victorious and founded the Han dynasty. A later\nredaction of the \u201cancient version\u201d was made by Fan\nYingyuan in the Song dynasty. There are some differences, but these\ntwo can be regarded as having stemmed from the same textual\ntradition.\n\n\nManuscript fragments discovered in the Dunhuang caves form another\nimportant source in Laozi research. Among them are several\nHeshanggong fragments (especially S. 477 and S. 3926 in the Stein\ncollection, and P. 2639 in the Pelliot collection) and the\nimportant Xiang\u2019er Laozi with commentary. Another Dunhuang\nmanuscript that merits attention is the \u201cSuo Dan\u201d\nfragment, now at the University Art Museum, Princeton University,\nwhich contains the last thirty-one chapters of the Daodejing\nbeginning with chapter 51 of the modern text. It is signed and dated\nat the end, bearing the name of the third-century scholar and diviner\nSuo Dan, who is said to have made the copy, written in ink on paper,\nin 270 C.E. According to Rao Zongyi (1955), the Suo Dan version\nbelongs to the Heshanggong line of the Laozi text. William\nBoltz (1996), however, questions its third-century date and argues\nthat the fragment in many instances also agrees with the Fu Yi\n\u201cancient version.\u201d\n\n\nWhile manuscript versions inform textual criticism of\nthe Laozi, stone inscriptions provide further collaborating\nsupport. Over twenty steles, mainly of Tang and Song origins, are\navailable to textual critics, although some are in poor condition (Yan\n1957). Students of the Laozi today can work with several\nChinese and Japanese studies that make use of a large number of\nmanuscript versions and stone inscriptions (notably Ma 1965, Jiang\n1980, Zhu 1980, and Shima 1973). Boltz (1993) offers an excellent\nintroduction to the manuscript traditions of\nthe Laozi. Wagner (2003) attempts to reconstruct the original\nface of Wang Bi\u2019s Laozi (cf. Lou 1980 and Lynn 1999). A major\ncontribution to Laozi studies in Chinese is Liu Xiaogan 2006,\nwhich compares the Guodian, Mawangdui, Fu Yi, Wang Bi, and Heshanggong\nversions of the Laozi and provides detailed textual and\ninterpretive analysis for each chapter. In an article in English, Liu\n(2003) sets out some of his main findings.\n",
