    "main_text": "\n\n\nIn many contexts, all of the individual members of a group can\nbenefit from the efforts of each member and all can benefit\nsubstantially from collective action. For example, if each of us\npollutes less by paying a bit extra for our cars, we all benefit from\nthe reduction of harmful gases in the air we breathe and even in the\nreduced harm to the ozone layer that protects us against exposure to\ncarcinogenic ultraviolet radiation (although those with fair skin\nbenefit far more from the latter than do those with dark skin). If all\nof us or some subgroup of us prefer the state of affairs in which we\neach pay this bit over the state of affairs in which we do not, then\nthe provision of cleaner air is a collective good for us. (If it costs\nmore than it is worth to us, then its provision is not a collective\ngood for us.)\n\n\nUnfortunately, my polluting less does not matter enough for anyone\u2014especially me\u2014to notice. Therefore, I may not contribute my share toward not fouling the atmosphere. I may be a free\nrider (or free rider) on the beneficial actions of\nothers. A free rider, most broadly speaking, is someone who receives a benefit without contributing towards the cost of its production. The free rider problem is that the efficient production of important collective goods by free agents is jeopardized by the incentive each agent has not to pay for it: if the supply of the good is inadequate, one\u2019s own action of paying will not make it adequate; if the supply is adequate, one can receive it without paying. This is a compelling application of the logic of collective action, an application of such grave import that we pass laws to regulate the behavior of individuals to force them\nto pollute less.\n\n\nThe free rider problem gives rise to large explanatory and normative questions in six main disciplines. Social psychology asks: To what extent and in what circumstances are people motivated to free ride? and What sorts of negative incentives are effective in motivating cooperation when free riding is possible? Game theory asks: Under what strategic circumstances does the rational promotion of individual self-interest recommend free riding? Informed by those two areas of enquiry, mainstream economics then asks: What real-world mechanisms are the most efficient ways of producing public goods, given the incentives to free ride? Political science asks: What explains the existence of large-scale political participation, despite the incentives that favor free riding? Moral philosophy asks: Under exactly which circumstances is free riding morally wrong? and What explains why it is wrong (when it is)? And relatedly, normative political philosophy asks: Do the moral reasons against free riding supply a satisfactory grounding for political obligation?\n",
