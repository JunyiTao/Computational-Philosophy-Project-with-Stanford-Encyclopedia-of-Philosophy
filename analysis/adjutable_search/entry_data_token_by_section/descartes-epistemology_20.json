    "main_text": "Self-Knowledge || That Mind is Better-Known than Body\n9.1 That Mind is Better-Known than Body\n\nDescartes holds that our judgments about our own minds are\nepistemically better-off than our judgments about bodies. In our\nnatural, pre-reflective condition, however, we\u2019re apt to confuse\nthe sensory images of bodies with the external things themselves, a\nconfusion leading us to think our judgments about bodies are\nepistemically impressive. The confusion is clearly expressed\n(Descartes would say) in G. E. Moore\u2019s famous claim to knowledge\n\u2013 \u201cHere is a hand\u201d \u2013 along with his more\ngeneral defense of common sense:\n\nI begin, then, with my list of truisms, every one of which (in my own\nopinion) I know, with certainty, to be true. \u2026 There\nexists at present a living human body, which is my body. This\nbody was born at a certain time in the past, and has existed\ncontinuously ever since \u2026 But the earth had existed also for\nmany years before my body was born \u2026 (1962, 32f)\n\n\nIn contrast, Descartes writes:\n\n[I]f I judge that the earth exists from the fact that I touch it or\nsee it, this very fact undoubtedly gives even greater support for the\njudgement that my mind exists. For it may perhaps be the case that I\njudge that I am touching the earth even though the earth does not\nexist at all; but it cannot be that, when I make this judgement, my\nmind which is making the judgement does not exist. (Prin.\n1:11, AT 8a:8f, CSM 1:196)\n\n\nMethodical doubt is intended to help us appreciate the folly of the\ncommonsensical position \u2013 helping us recognize that perception\nof our own minds is \u201cnot simply prior to and more certain\n\u2026 but also more evident\u201d than perception of our own\nbodies (Prin. 1:11, AT 8a:8, CSM 1:196). \u201cDisagreement\non this point,\u201d writes Descartes, comes from \u201cthose who\nhave not done their philosophizing in an orderly way\u201d; from\nthose who, while properly acknowledging the \u201ccertainty of their\nown existence,\u201d mistakenly \u201ctake \u2018themselves\u2019\nto mean only their bodies\u201d \u2013 failing to \u201crealize\nthat they should have taken \u2018themselves\u2019 in this context\nto mean their minds alone\u201d (Prin. 1:12, AT 8a:9, CSM\n1:196).\n\nIn epistemological contexts, Descartes purports to establish the\nmind-better-known-than-body doctrine with methodical doubt. For\nexample, while reflecting on his epistemic position in regard both to\nhimself, and to the wax, the Second Meditation meditator says: \n\nSurely my awareness of my own self is not merely much truer and more\ncertain than my awareness of the wax, but also much more distinct and\nevident. For if I judge that the wax exists from the fact that I see\nit, clearly this same fact entails much more evidently that I myself\nalso exist. It is possible that what I see is not really the wax; it\nis possible that I do not even have eyes with which to see anything.\nBut when I see, or think I see (I am not here distinguishing the two),\nit is simply not possible that I who am now thinking am not something.\n(AT 7:33, CSM 2:22)\n\n\nFurther reasons might be helping to motivate Descartes\u2019 view.\nOn the kind of representational theory of perception that is widely \nattributed to him, our sense organs and nerves serve as literal mediating links in the causal chains generating sense perception:\nthey stand between (both spatially and causally) external things themselves, and the brain events occasioning our perceptual\nawareness (cf. Prin. 4:196). In veridical sensation, the \nobjects of immediate sensory awareness are not external bodies \nthemselves, nor are we immediately aware of the states of our sense \norgans or nerves. Rather, the objects of immediate awareness are \n\u2013 whether in veridical sensation, or in dreams \u2013 the \nmind\u2019s own ideas. Descartes indeed holds that the\nfact of physiological mediation helps explain delusional ideas,\nbecause roughly the same kinds of physiological processes that\nproduce waking ideas are employed in producing delusional ideas:\n\n[I]t is the soul which sees, and not the eye; and it does not see\ndirectly, but only by means of the brain. That is why madmen and those\nwho are asleep often see, or think they see, various objects which are\nnevertheless not before their eyes: namely, certain vapours disturb\ntheir brain and arrange those of its parts normally engaged in vision\nexactly as they would be if these objects were present.\n(Optics, AT 6:141, CSM 1:172; cf. AT 7:85ff and AT 11:248f)\n\n\nVarious passages of the Meditations lay important groundwork\nfor this theory of perception. For instance, one of the messages of\nthe wax passage is that sensory awareness does not reach to external\nthings themselves: \n\nWe say that we see the wax itself, if it is there before us, not that\nwe judge it to be there from its colour or shape; and this might lead\nme to conclude without more ado that knowledge of the wax comes from\nwhat the eye sees, and not from the scrutiny of the mind alone. But\nthen if I look out of the window and see men crossing the square, as I\njust happen to have done, I normally say that I see the men\nthemselves, just as I say that I see the wax. Yet do I see any more\nthan hats and coats which could conceal automatons? I judge\nthat they are men. (Med. 2, AT 7:32, CSM 2:21)\n\n\nDescartes thinks we\u2019re apt to be \u201ctricked by ordinary\nways of talking\u201d (ibid.). In ordinary contexts we \ndon\u2019t say that it seems there are men outside the \nwindow; we say that we see them. Nor, in such contexts,\nare our beliefs about those men apt to result from conscious, \ninferentially complex judgments, say, like this one: \u201cWell,\nI appear to be awake, and the window pane looks clean, and \nthere\u2019s plenty of light outside, and so on, and I thus\nconclude that I am seeing men outside the window.\u201d Even\nso, our ordinary ways of speaking and thinking often mislead. \nDescartes\u2019 view is that the mind\u2019s immediate perception \ndoes not, strictly speaking, extend beyond itself, to external\nbodies. This is an important basis of the mind-better-known-than-body \ndoctrine. In the concluding paragraph of the Second Meditation, \nDescartes writes:\n\nI see that without any effort I have now finally got back to\nwhere I wanted. I now know that even bodies are not strictly\n[proprie] perceived by the senses or the faculty of\nimagination but by the intellect alone, and that this perception\nderives not from their being touched or seen but from their being\nunderstood; and in view of this I know plainly that I can achieve an\neasier and more evident perception of my own mind than of anything\nelse. (AT 7:34, CSM 2:22f)\n\n\nThe understanding of ideas as the only immediate objects of\nawareness arises in a number of texts. In the Sixth Meditation,\nwhile discussing sense perception and our ideas of external things, \nDescartes writes that the mind\u2019s sensation extends strictly\nand immediately only to the ideas: \u201cthe ideas were, strictly \nspeaking, the only immediate objects of my sensory awareness\n[solas proprie et immediate sentiebam]\u201d (AT 7:75,\nCSM 2:52). The Second Replies defines thought \u201cto \ninclude everything that is within us in such a way that we are \nimmediately aware of it\u201d; it defines idea in\nterms of the \u201cimmediate perception\u201d that makes us \n\u201caware of the thought\u201d (AT 7:160, CSM 2:113). And\nin the Third Replies Descartes writes: \u201cI make it quite\nclear in several places \u2026 that I am taking the word \n\u2018idea\u2019 to refer to whatever is immediately perceived\nby the mind\u201d (AT 7:181, CSM 2:127).\n\nComplicating an understanding of such passages is that Descartes\nscholarship is divided on whether to attribute to him some version of\nan indirect theory of perception, or instead some version of a direct\ntheory. According to indirect perception accounts, in normal sensation\nthe mind\u2019s perception of bodies is mediated by an awareness of\nits ideas of those bodies. By contrast, direct perception\ninterpretations allow that in normal sensation the mind\u2019s ideas\nplay a mediating role, though this role doesn\u2019t have ideas\nfunctioning as items of awareness; rather, the objects of direct\nawareness are the external things, themselves. On both accounts, ideas\nmediate our perception of external objects. On direct theory accounts,\nthe mediating role is only a process role. By analogy, various brain\nprocesses mediate our perception of external objects, but in the\nnormal course of perception we are not consciously aware of\nthose processes; and likewise for the mind\u2019s ideas,\naccording to direct perception accounts. On one recent version of an\nindirect perception interpretation, sensory ideas mediate our\nperception of the external bodies they\u2019re of, in much the same\nway that pictures (or other representational media) mediate our\nperception of what they portray (Newman 2009). More generally,\nDescartes seems to view all ideas as mental pictures, of a sort. As he\nwrites: \u201cthe term \u2018idea\u2019 is strictly\nappropriate\u201d only for thoughts that \u201care as it were the\nimages of things\u201d (Med. 3, AT 7:37, CSM 2:25); he adds that\n\u201cthe ideas in me are like {pictures, or} images\u201d (Med. 3,\nAT 7:42, CSM 2:29). \n\nIndirect perception interpretations have figured prominently in the\nhistory of Descartes scholarship. A number of recent commentators,\nhowever, have challenged this traditional view. For example,\nCarriero defends a direct perception interpretation: \u201cI don\u2019t read Descartes as holding that I am (immediately)\naware only of my sensory ideas and only subsequently (and perhaps \nindirectly) aware of bodies or their qualities\u201d (2009, 25).\nThus on Carriero\u2019s reading, Descartes\u2019 broader argument \nrebutting our doubts about the external world is not to be understood \nas an effort to get on the other side (as it were) of our ideas:\n\nThe argument (as I understand it) is not intended to get us from a\nrealm of inner mental objects (\u201csensory ideas\u201d) to some\nother realm of outer, physical objects (\u201cbodies\u201d); rather,\nit is to confirm our instinctive feeling that we have been receiving\ninformation (\u201cdirectly\u201d) from outer objects, bodies, all\nalong. (2009, 26)\n\n\n(For further discussion of Descartes\u2019 theory of ideas and\nperception, see Carriero 2009, Chappell 1986, Cunning 2010,\nHoffman 1996 and 2009, Jolley 1990, Nadler 2006, Nelson 1997, \nNewman 2009, 2011, and Smith 2014.)\n",
