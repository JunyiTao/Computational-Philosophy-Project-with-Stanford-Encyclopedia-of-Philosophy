    "main_text": "The Moral Confusion Argument\n3. The Moral Confusion Argument\n\n\nIn the first journal article focusing on the ethics of chimeras,\nJason Scott Robert and Fran\u00e7oise Baylis (2003) puzzle over\nthe negative reaction exhibited by the public to human/non-human chimeras.\nSome people think that the public\u2019s reaction is explained by a widely\nheld belief in fixed and well-defined boundaries between species, or at\nleast between the human species and non-human species, but in fact \u201cno\nextant species concept justifies the erection of the fixed boundaries\nbetween human beings and nonhumans that are required to make breaching\nthose boundaries morally problematic\u201d (ibid., 6). Others think\nthat what people find objectionable is that crossing species boundaries\nconstitutes playing God, but many people do not believe in God and\nothers believe that God not only licenses, but enjoins the kind of\ncreative research involved in chimeras. Others think that people react\nto the prospect of chimeras with repugnance, but such reactions are not\nthemselves sufficient grounds for concluding that an activity is\nimmoral. Nor do people\u2019s beliefs in its being taboo to blur sharp and\nsignificant conceptual boundaries explain their negative reaction,\nbecause the conceptual boundary between humans and non-humans is not\nsharp.\n\n\nSo what does explain the public\u2019s negative reaction? Baylis and\nRobert speculate that people object to chimeras because\nthey accept the Moral Confusion Argument, according to which it is\nwrong to create chimeras because of the moral confusion that would be\ngenerated by the existence of individuals that cannot be definitively\nclassified as human or as non-human (ibid., 9). This moral\nconfusion would arise because people employ two distinct frameworks for\nunderstanding moral status: if an individual is a human being, then it\nhas full moral status, and it has that status independently of anyone\nelse\u2019s attitudes or intentions regarding it, but if an individual is a\nnon-human animal, then it does not have full moral status, and,\nfurther, the moral status it does have and the nature of the\nobligations we have towards it are contingent upon the attitudes and\nintentions of their human creators or overseers. For a borderline\nhuman/non-human chimera, it would not be clear which framework to employ\nand, consequently, it would not be clear what our moral obligations to\nthis entity would be. Would it be appropriate to kill it for\nfood, or would that be murder? Which set of biomedical research\nprotections would apply, the relatively weak constraints on animal\nresearch or the comparatively strong constraints on human subjects\nresearch?\n\n\nA real-life example that illustrates the possibility that chimera\nresearch might disrupt a useful social practice is the attempt in 1998\nby Stuart Newman (a professor of cell biology and anatomy) and Jeremy\nRifkin (an anti-biotechnology activist) to patent a broad range of\nchimeras resulting from the mixing of human and nonhuman embryonic\ncells (Heathcotte and Robert 2006; Rabin 2006). In 1987, then-United\nStates Commissioner of Patent and Trademarks, Donald Quigg had\nannounced that although human beings were not patentable,\nmulticellular living organisms, including animals, were. Newman and\nRifkin submitted their patent application in the hopes that either (a)\nthe patent would be issued, thus giving them the legal right to\nprevent people from creating such chimeras, or (b) the patent would\nnot be issued, forcing the United States Patent Office to clarify the\ndividing line between human beings and nonhuman animals. In the end,\nthe patent application was rejected, both on technical grounds as well\nas the grounds that it encompassed human beings, which were not\npatentable (Weiss 2005). The Patent Office, however, declined to offer any precise\ndetails as to how to evaluate whether a chimera counted as a human\nbeing or not. But what if, a proponent of the Moral Confusion Argument\nmight ask, the Patent Office had instead decided to revise their view\nand allow patents on human beings or to reject all patents on\nanimals. Either decision would have entailed significant changes in\nthe social practice of patenting with, arguably, significant\ncosts.\nMoreover, the existence of a borderline human/non-human chimera\nwould generate confusion regarding our existing relationships as we\nwere forced to revisit the general question of whether being a human\nbeing really is necessary and sufficient for full moral status. Such\nconfusion, Robert and Baylis say, \u201cthreatens the social fabric in\nuntold ways; countless social institutions, structures, and practices\ndepend upon the moral distinction drawn between human and nonhuman\nanimals\u201d (2003, 10). In these ways, then, \u201cthe creation of\nnovel beings that are part human and part nonhuman is sufficiently\nthreatening to the social order that for many this is sufficient reason\nto prohibit any crossing of species boundaries involving human beings\u201d\n(ibid., 10).\n\n\nThere appears to be no empirical evidence to support the\nsociological claim that the Moral Confusion Argument explains the\npublic\u2019s negative reaction. Among the voluminous social science\nresearch on public attitudes towards biotechnology, the U.S. Office of\nTechnology Assessment\u2019s (OTA) report on public perceptions of\nbiotechnology remains the most comprehensive study of its kind in many\nways. It found that consequentialist concerns were cited by only a\nmeager 1% (for environmental concerns) to 8% (for \u201cunforeseen\nconsequences\u201d) of the respondents who believed that creating\ncross-species plants or animals was morally wrong (Office of Technology\nAssessment 1987). Concerns about playing God and tampering with nature\nwere much more prevalent. And even if these concerns are unfounded, as\nBaylis and Robert contend, it is surely fallacious to conclude that\nthey are not motivating the public\u2019s negative reaction. Conversely,\neven if the threat of moral confusion is a serious one, that does not\nalter the fact that it apparently did not even merit explicit mention by\nthe OTA.\n\n\nSetting aside the sociological claim that the public\u2019s acceptance of\nthe Moral Confusion Argument explains its reaction to chimeras, what\nabout the Moral Confusion Argument itself? (Robert and Baylis\nexplicitly refuse to endorse or reject the argument, but they do invite\nbioethicists to begin assessing its moral weight.)\n\n\nClaims that the social fabric will be threatened by the latest\nscientific research are usually vague and ill-defined enough so as to\nresist conclusive refutation, but two things seem clear about\nthe Moral Confusion Argument. First, it seems highly unlikely that\nchimera research would cause significant confusion along the lines\ndescribed. Second, even if chimeras were to cause confusion, that would\nnot provide much, if any, moral reason against creating them.\n\n\nAs to the first point, chimeras that are truly difficult to\ndefinitively classify as human or non-human are purely hypothetical.\nEven the chimeras involving the most extensive mixing to date\n(Goldstein et al. 2002; Muotri et al. 2005; James et al. 2006) resulted\nonly in individuals easily classified as non-human animals. Such easily\ncategorized individuals pose no more threat to our views about moral status\nthan does a human being with a pig heart valve, that is, no threat\nwhatsoever. Hence, the idea that such confusion is threatened by\n\u201cany crossing of species boundaries involving human beings\u201d\n(Robert and Baylis 2003, 10; emphasis added) is surely mistaken. And\neven if researchers were to create chimeras that were truly on the\nborder between human and non-human, it still would not follow that\nthere would be significant confusion as to the proper moral framework\nfor their treatment. If the chimeras were clearly persons (by\nexhibiting a high degree of autonomy, rationality, self-awareness,\netc.), then it would be clear to most people that they have full moral\nstatus, even if it would not be clear what species they were. As Andrew\nSiegel (2003, 33) notes, most people hold the belief that \u201cspecies\ndoesn\u2019t matter where one possesses other traits that confer moral\nstanding.\u201d Those who do mistakenly believe that being a human being is\nnecessary for full moral status might simply correct their mistaken\nbelief when confronted with an actual example of a non-human or\nborderline-human that was clearly a person. Only the remaining people\nwho retain that belief would be confused.\n\n\nPotentially more confusing would be an individual that was clearly a\nnon-person but who had just enough human material that they could not\nbe definitively classified as human or as non-human; for example, a\nblastocyst-stage chimpanzee embryo which has had half of its inner\ncell mass replaced with hESCs. But even in this extreme case, those\nwho believe that a fully-human conceptus has no moral status prior to\nthe onset of consciousness will simply conclude that a\nblastocyst-stage chimeric conceptus has no moral status either. Those\nwho believe that a fully human conceptus has full moral status from\nconception would need to decide how to classify such a chimera and may\nbe confused by the situation. But it is unclear why Robert and Baylis\nthink that someone\u2019s being confused about the specific case of the\nchimera would also make them revisit their general belief that being a\nhuman being is sufficient for full moral status. If the clear lack of\npersonhood of a human embryo or fetus does not cause such people to\nrevisit the general issue, why would the clear lack of personhood of a\nchimeric embryo, which would seem to have even less going for it from\nthis perspective, cause them to revisit it? Indeed, it is not clear\nwhy borderline cases pose any challenge to a general belief about\nnecessary and sufficient conditions. Someone who believes that being a\nmale sibling is necessary and sufficient for being a brother will not\nbe led to doubt that biconditional by the existence of an intersex\nperson who is on the border between being male and being female. To\nthe extent that it is vague whether the individual is male, it is also\nvague whether the individual is a brother.\n\n\nSo confusion would really only arise for certain subgroups of people\nwith specific beliefs and with respect to chimeras that are, at the\npresent time, purely hypothetical.\n\n\nAs to the second point, even supposing that chimeric research did\ncause society to revisit its views about the comparative moral worth\nof humans and nonhumans, it still remains that this would provide\nlittle reason not to create chimeras. Indeed, it seems more plausible\nthat this would provide, on balance, a reason to create\nthem. Returning to the example of Stuart and Rifkin\u2019s patent\napplication for chimeras, although the United States Patent Office\ndeclined to offer guidance on distinguishing humans from nonhumans for\nthe purpose of patent law, legal scholars have begun to address this\nissue (Stankovi\u0107 2005; Zylstra 2012). Of course, it is logically\npossible that their scholarly efforts will result in changes to patent\nlaw that will be for the worse, but that bare possibility is clearly\ninsufficient to justify an ethical condemnation of the scientists who\ncreated chimeras that led to Newman and Rifkin\u2019s patent application\nwhich in turn led to scholarly efforts that might in turn lead to\nnegative changes in patent law. As another, more urgent example,\nconsider that our willingness to place the gustatory interests of\nhumans ahead of the interests of non-human animals in avoiding pain,\nsuffering, and death has been one of the greatest causes of\nunnecessary suffering in history (Scully 2002). In the United States\nalone, there are approximately 9.5 billion agricultural animals\nslaughtered each year, even though a vegetarian diet could easily\nsatisfy most Americans\u2019 nutritional needs (Humane Society of the\nUnited States 2009). (This count excludes marine animals, which could\neasily triple the total, and for whom death almost inevitably comes\nfrom either suffocation or being crushed.) Revisiting the moral views\nthat are invoked to support this situation is probably essential to\nimproving this social institution. Thus, to prevent scientific\nresearch on the grounds that it would force people to reexamine our\nviews about moral status would be to prevent not only scientific\nprogress but urgently needed moral progress as well.\n",
