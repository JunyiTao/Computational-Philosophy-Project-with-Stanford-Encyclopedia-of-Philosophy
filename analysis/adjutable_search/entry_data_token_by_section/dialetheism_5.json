    "main_text": "Dialetheism in the History of Philosophy || Modern Dialetheism\n2.4 Modern Dialetheism\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, with the rapid\ndevelopment of paraconsistent logics, came the modern form of\ndialetheism. In 1966, Asenjo published a short note, \u201cA Calculus\nof Antinomies\u201d, based on his 1954 PhD dissertation; the opening\nline reads\n\nLet us assume that atomic propositions have either one or two truth\nvalues (Asenjo 1966, p.103).\n\n\nHere, having two truth values would mean being both true and\nfalse, a glut, or what Asenjo calls (following Kant) an antinomy.\nAsenjo simply seems to assume without further ado that there are\nantinomies, and in Asenjo and Tamburino 1975 asserts that they are\n\u201cuseful logical entities\u201d, especially for dealing with\nparadoxes in mathematical contexts. Born in Buenos Aires, Asenjo came\nto the University of Pittsburg in 1963 as a professor in the\nmathematics faculty, where he was in contact with logicians such as\nBelnap, Anderson, their student Dunn (who thanks Asenjo in his 1966\nPhD thesis, that also toys with true contradictions), and nearby,\nMeyer. By the mid-1970s, Richard Routley (Sylvan), in collaboration\nwith Meyer, was developing a \u2018dialectical\u2019 position that\nrebukes what they call \u201cthe consistency hypothesis\u201d and\naccepts some statements as both true and false (Routley and Meyer\n1976; Routley 1977, 1979). In 1979, Priest\u2019s paper \u201cThe\nLogic of Paradox\u201d, developed eventually into the book In\nContradiction (1987/2006), presented what are now the most famous\narguments for dialetheism. In the collaboration between Priest and\nRoutley, the contemporary dialetheic program was launched. Much of\nPriest and Routley\u2019s early joint work is summarised in Priest et\nal 1989 (also available as Priest and Routley 1983). More recent\ndevelopments are canvassed below. \n",
