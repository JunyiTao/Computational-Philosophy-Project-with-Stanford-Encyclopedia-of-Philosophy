    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Providence\n4.2 Providence\n\nThe exposition of Lambda is followed by three chapters which\ndiscuss the theme of Providence\n(\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1) of the First Principle.\n\u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s main source is Alexander of\nAphrodisias\u2019 De Providentia (Ruland 1976, 1979;\nZimmermann 1986; Thillet 2003; Martini Bonadeo 2017a). \u2018Abd\nal-Latif therefore mutually harmonizes two solutions which are in\nreality quite different from one another, not to say alternative: that\nput forward by Alexander regarding the problem of divine\nprovidence\u2014the First Principle thinks and knows primarily only\nitself, but it eternally knows the events of the world too, subject to\nbecoming, in so far as it exercises its own direction over them\nthrough the celestial order\u2014and that of Themistius, which\n\u2018Abd al-Latif had already made his own in the course of his\nparaphrase of Lambda, whereby God knows that which is\ndifferent from him without for this reason coming out of himself,\nsince he contains in him all the ideas of all things, and is the norm\nand the condition of the intelligibility of the world.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif maintains that the action of God\u2019s\nprovidence expresses itself both in the superior and in the inferior\nworld; but if in the first case the relationship between divine\nprovidence and the superior world is immediate, in the second case it\nis mediated by the superior world. The relationship between divine\nprovidence and those who receive it, however, cannot be thought of as\na causal relationship, since in this case \u201cthe noble would come\ninto being because of the ignoble and the earlier because of the\nlater\u201d (Rosenthal 1975: 156), which is shameful, nor can this\nrelationship be thought as purely accidental. Both situations are\nunsuitable for the First Principle, which cannot therefore exercise\nprovidence as its primary action, but cannot either be considered as\nthat from which providence derives accidentally. \u2018Abd al-Latif\nthen affirms that the existence and the order of things derive from\nthe existence of God, who is absolute good and returns to the image of\nfire which warms everything: God concedes to all existing things as\nmuch good as they, for their proximity to him, are able to receive.\nThe bodies of the sublunary world are able to enjoy the potency which\nemanates from God and so they tend to move towards him. Among the\nexisting things of the sublunary world, man has been given the\ncapacity for reason, due to which he can carry out those actions that\nlead him to acquire the happiness appropriate to him. The same\nrational capacity allows him to know divine things and, in virtue of\nthis knowledge, man is superior to all other things that come to being\nand pass away. At times, however, he uses this rational capacity to\nobtain, not the good and virtues, but vices. This can happen because\nprovidence allows man the capacity to be able to acquire virtues, but\nthe success of this enterprise lies in the will and in the choice made\nby man himself.\n\nFollowing the lead of Alexander\u2019s treatise On\nProvidence, \u2018Abd al-Latif introduces the problem of evil\nand places his examination of those aspects of the doctrine of\nprovidence that regard man and his actions within the framework of a\ndiscussion more of a cosmological nature. For this reason, though he\nfavours Themistius\u2019 solution whereby God knows all things in\nthat he contains within him the ideas of all things, which he holds to\nbe closest to the dogma of the Koran, \u2018Abd al-Latif has recourse\nto Alexander concerning the problems of evil, man\u2019s free will,\nand divine justice.\n",
