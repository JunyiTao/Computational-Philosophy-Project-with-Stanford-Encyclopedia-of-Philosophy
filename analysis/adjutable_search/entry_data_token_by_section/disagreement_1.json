    "main_text": "Belief-Disagreement vs. Action-Disagreement\n2. Belief-Disagreement vs. Action-Disagreement\n\n\nSuppose Jop and Dop are college students who are dating. They disagree\nabout two matters: whether it\u2019s harder to get top grades in\neconomics classes or philosophy classes, and whether they should move\nin together this summer. The first disagreement is over the truth\nof a claim: is the claim (or belief) \u2018It is harder to get\ntop grades in economics classes compared to philosophy classes\u2019\ntrue or not? The second disagreement is over an action:\nshould we move in together or not (the action = moving in together)?\nCall the first kind of disagreement belief-disagreement; call\nthe second kind action-disagreement.\n\n\nThe latter is very different from the former. Laksha is a doctor faced\nwith a tough decision regarding one of her patients. She needs to\nfigure out whether it\u2019s best, all things considered, to just\ncontinue with the medications she has been prescribing or stop them\nand go with surgery. She confers closely with some of her\ncolleagues. Some of them say surgery is the way to go, others say she\nshould continue with medications and see what happens, but no one has\na firm opinion: all the doctors agree that it\u2019s a close call,\nall things considered. Laksha realizes that as far as anyone can tell\nit really is a tie.\n\n\nIn this situation Laksha should probably suspend judgment on each of\nthe two claims \u2018Surgery is the best overall option for this\npatient\u2019 and \u2018Medication is the best overall option for\nthis patient\u2019. When asked \u2018Which option is best?\u2019\nshe should suspend judgment.\n\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good, but she still has to do\nsomething. She can\u2019t just refuse to treat the patient. Even if\nshe continues to investigate the case for days and days, in effect she\nhas made the decision to not do surgery. She has made a choice even if\nshe dithers.\n\n\nThe point is this: when it comes to belief-disagreements,\nthere are three broad options with respect to a specific claim:\nbelieve it, disbelieve it, and suspend judgment on it. (And of course\nthere are a great many levels of confidence to take as well.) But when\nit comes to action-disagreements, there are just two options\nwith respect to an action \\(X\\): do \\(X\\), don\u2019t do\n\\(X\\). Suspending judgment just doesn\u2019t exist when it comes to\nan action. Or, to put it a different way, suspending judgment on\nwhether to do \\(X\\) does exist but is pretty much the same thing as\nnot doing \\(X\\), since in both cases you don\u2019t do \\(X\\) (Feldman\n2006c).\n\n\nThus, there are disagreements over what to believe and\nwhat to do. Despite this distinction, we can achieve some\nsimplicity and uniformity by construing disagreements over what to do\nas disagreements over what to believe. We do it this way: if we\ndisagree over whether to do action \\(X\\), we are disagreeing over the\ntruth of the claim \u2018We should do \\(X\\)\u2019 (or \u2018I\nshould do \\(X\\)\u2019 or \u2018\\(X\\) is the best thing for us to\ndo\u2019; no, these aren\u2019t all equivalent). This translation of\naction-disagreements into claim-disagreements makes it easy for us to\nconstrue all disagreements as disagreements about what to\nbelieve, where the belief may or may not concern an action. Keep in\nmind, though, that this \u201ctranslation\u201d doesn\u2019t mean\nthat action-disagreements are just like belief-disagreements that\ndon\u2019t involve actions: the former still requires a choice on\nwhat one is actually going to do.\n\n\nWith those points in mind, we can formulate the primary questions\nabout the epistemology of disagreement.\n\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that agreement also has\nepistemological implications. If learning that a large number and\npercentage of your epistemic peers or superiors disagree with you\nshould probably make you lower your confidence in your belief, then\nlearning that those same individuals agree with you should probably\nmake you raise your confidence in your belief\u2014provided they have\ngreater confidence in it than you did before you found out about their\nagreement.\n\n\nIn posing the questions we start with a single individual who realizes\nthat one or more other people disagree/agree with her regarding one of\nher beliefs. We can formulate the questions with regard to just\ndisagreement or to agreement and disagreement; we also have the choice\nof focusing on just agreement/disagreement or going with levels of\nconfidence.\n\n\nHere are the primary epistemological questions for just disagreement\nand no levels of confidence:\n\nResponse Question: Suppose you realize that some people\ndisagree with your belief \\(B\\). How must you respond to the\nrealization in order for that response to be epistemically\nrational (or perhaps wise)?\n\nBelief Question: Suppose you realize that some people disagree with\nyour belief \\(B\\). How must you respond to the realization in order\nfor your subsequent position on \\(B\\) to be epistemically\nrational?\n\n\n\nHere are the questions for agreement/disagreement plus levels of\nconviction:\n\nResponse Question*: Suppose you realize that some people have a\nconfidence level in \\(B\\) that is different from yours. How must you\nrespond to the realization in order for that response to be\nepistemically rational (or perhaps wise)?\n\nBelief Question*: Suppose you realize that some people have a\nconfidence level in \\(B\\) that is different from yours. How must you\nrespond to the realization in order for your subsequent\nposition on \\(B\\) to be epistemically rational?\n\n",
