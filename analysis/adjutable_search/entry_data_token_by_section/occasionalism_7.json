    "main_text": "Occasionalism in Context || Mere Conservationism, Divine Concurrentism, and Occasionalism\n2.2 Mere Conservationism, Divine Concurrentism, and Occasionalism\n\nThe other issue that occasionalism addresses is one that concerns how\ndivine causality relates to natural causality, or as Alfred Freddoso\nhas put it, \u201cthe general problem of divine action in\nnature\u201d (Freddoso 1994, 131\u20135). The problem, as Freddoso\nnotes, consists of the following questions: if God ultimately is the\nfirst and direct cause of everything, including whatever occurs and\nexists in nature, can there be any causal activity on the part of\ncreatures?; and if there is secondary causation, how does this causal\nactivity fit in with God\u2019s causal activity? In response to these\nquestions, historically, three positions have appeared:\n\u201cconservationism,\u201d \u201cconcurrentism,\u201d and\n\u201coccasionalism.\u201d\n\nWe might distinguish the three positions by the degree of causal\nactivity assigned to God and the creature respectively, when a natural\nevent takes place. At one end is conservationism, which keeps divine\ncausal involvement to a minimum. According to conservationism, while\nGod conserves substances with their powers in existence, when\ncreatures are causally active in bringing about their natural effects,\nGod\u2019s contribution is remote or indirect. In other words,\nGod\u2019s causal contribution consists in merely conserving the\nbeing or esse of the creature in question along with its\npower, and the causal activity of the creature is in some\nstraightforward sense the creature\u2019s own and not God\u2019s\n(Freddoso 1991, 554). At the other end is occasionalism, where divine\ncausal activity is maximal and creaturely causal activity is\nnon-existent. For the occasionalist, divine causal activity is the\nonly type of genuine causality. Creatures provide at most an occasion\nfor God\u2019s activity, which is uniquely direct and immediate in\nbringing about all effects in nature. Concurrentism (or \u201cdivine\nconcurrentism\u201d) can then be seen as occupying the middle ground.\nConcurrentists hold that when a natural effect is produced, it is\nimmediately caused by both God and the creature. God\nand the creature are both directly involved and \u201cconcur\u201d\nin bringing about the natural effects typically attributed to the\n creature.[13]\n",
