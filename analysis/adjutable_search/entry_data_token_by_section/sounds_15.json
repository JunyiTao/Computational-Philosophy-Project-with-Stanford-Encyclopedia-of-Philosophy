    "main_text": "Aspatial Theories || Sounds as Pure Events\n5. Conclusion\n\nWe have suggested that a fruitful way to classify the various accounts\nof sounds that have been given in the literature is in terms of their\nspatial locations. If the sounds we hear have spatial locations, they\ncan be thought to be located either where the material sources are\n(distal theories), or where the hearers are (proximal theories), or\nsomewhere in between (medial theories). It has also been denied that\nsounds have any spatial locations, which gives rise to a fourth class\nof theories, aspatial theories. All these theories have interestingly\ndifferent phenomenological, epistemological and metaphysical\nimplications.\n",
