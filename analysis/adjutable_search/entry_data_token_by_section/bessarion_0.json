    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nBessarion was born in Trebizond between 1399 and 1408, and baptized\nBasil. At a young age, he went to Byzantium, where he studied with\nJohn Cortasmenos (d. 1431/7). He changed his name to Bessarion when he\nbecame a monk in 1423. Pursuing his ecclesiastical career, Bessarion\nengaged in diplomatic activity in the service of the emperor John VIII\nPalaiologos. This put him in contact with the court of the Despot of\nMistra, a city where he had the opportunity to deepen his\nphilosophical and mathematical training under the guidance of Gemistos\nPletho (d. 1454). The decisive year in the life of Bessarion was\nprobably 1437, when he was made metropolitan of Nicea (hence the\ncommon epithet of Cardinal Nicenus) and left for Italy as\nmember of the Greek delegation to the Council of Ferrara-Florence.\nThe Council was mainly devoted to an attempt at unifying the Latin\nand Greek Churches, which the Western European powers had made a\ncondition for providing military support to Palaiologos as he\nattempted to fend off the Ottoman Turks. As a member of the Greek\ndelegation, the young Bessarion was not eager to concede the main\ndogmatic point of disagreement between the two churches, which had led\nto their separation in the eleventh century: the problem of the place\nof the Holy Spirit in the Creed. According to the Greeks the Spirit\nproceeded only from the Father, while in the Roman formulation it also\nproceeded from the Son (Filioque). And yet, driven by his\nconcern for the unstable political situation in Greece and finally\nconvinced by the texts of the Church Fathers, Bessarion changed his\nmind and in April 1439 pronounced an oration (the Oratio dogmatica\nde unione), in which he advocated for agreement between Greek and\nLatin authors. In July 1439 Bessarion read the act of union between\nthe Roman and the Greek Church in Florence. The same year, while he\nwas in Greece for the last time, Bessarion was made Cardinal.\n\nBessarion would spend the rest of his life as one of the most\nimportant and influential members of the Roman Curia. He was selected\nfor important diplomatic missions; for example, in 1450 Niccol\u00f2\nV sent him to Bologna as legato a latere. He took particular\ncare of Greek rites abbeys, like those in Calabria, Messina, and\nGrottaferrata. He obtained a number of benefices, and in 1458 he was\nselected as protector of the Franciscan Order. In 1463 he also became\nPatriarch of Constantinople. He even came close to being elevated to\nthe papacy at least twice, but apparently his beard\u2014which for\nmany symbolized his Greek origins\u2014prevented him from garnering\nthe necessary support. His activities as a cardinal were coupled with\nscholarly enterprises, which he undertook personally, and also\nsponsored as the patron of a circle of intellectuals who were in many\ncases Greek emigr\u00e9s like him. Men like Theodore Gaza (d. 1476)\nand Niccol\u00f2 Perotti (d. 1480)\u2014and for a short period even\nhis nemesis-to-be George of Trebizond (d. 1473)\u2014were all part of\nthe Cardinal\u2019s entourage. \n\nAfter the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Bessarion\u2019s main\ninterest was in rescuing the cultural heritage of his homeland,\nGreece, and he pursued this goal on both intellectual and political\nplanes. From an intellectual point of view, Bessarion\u2019s plan\ninvolved salvaging Greek texts which were until then unknown in\nWestern Christendom and were generally rare (to the extent that in\nsome cases they survive today only in the exemplars collected by the\nCardinal). An avid lifelong book collector, Bessarion assembled a\nlibrary in order to prevent the loss of these treasures:\n\u201cwithout books, the tomb would cover the names of men, just as\nit covers their bodies\u201d.  Bessarion feared\u2014indeed he was\nconsumed with terror\u2014\u201clest all those wonderful books, the\nproduct of so much toil and study by the greatest human minds, those\nvery beacons of the earth, should be brought to danger and destruction\nin an instant\u201d. Bessarion felt that Venice\u2014a city with\nwhich he had entertained a long relationship and where he served as\npapal legate in 1463\u2014could be a safe haven for his library and\nthe books he donated around 1468 formed the first nucleus of the\nBiblioteca Marciana.\n\nIn addition to saving books from destruction,\nBessarion had also a more practical political agenda for his homeland;\nhe was among the most vocal advocates for the call for a new crusade to\nfree Greece from Ottoman control. He was therefore engaged in\nseveral diplomatic missions, in Germany and then in Vienna, which\naimed to convince Western rulers to fight the Turks. After an attempt\nin 1464 failed because of the death of Pope Pius II in Ancona, Bessarion\nworked until the end of his days to build support \nfor a project that appeared more and more illusory with every passing\nyear. It was on the way back from one of these diplomatic missions in\n1472, this time to France, that Bessarion fell ill and died in\nRavenna. He was interred in his titular Church, SS. Apostoli in Rome,\nwhere Antoniazzo Romano and Melozzo da Forl\u00ec had decorated a\nchapel in his name between 1464 and 1467.\n",
