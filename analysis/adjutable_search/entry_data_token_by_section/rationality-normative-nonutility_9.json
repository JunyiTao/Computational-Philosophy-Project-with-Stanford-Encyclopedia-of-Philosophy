    "main_text": "Imprecise Probabilities or Ambiguity || Proposals: Decision Rules\n4.3 Proposals: Decision Rules\n\nWe will examine rules for decision-making with imprecise probabilities\nin terms of how they evaluate the Ellsberg choices; for ease of\nexposition we will assume \\(u(\\$0) = 0\\) and \\(u(\\$100) = 1.\\) All\nproposals here are equivalent to EU maximization when there is a\nsingle probability distribution in the set, so all will assign utility\n\\(\\lfrac{1}{3}\\) to \\(f_1\\) and \\(\\lfrac{2}{3}\\) to \\(f_4\\) in the\nEllsberg gamble; they differ in how they value the other acts.\n4.3.1 Aggregative Decision Rules using Sets of Probabilities\n\nThe first type of decision rule associates to each act a single value,\nand yields a complete ranking of acts; call these aggregative\nrules. The rules in this section use sets of probabilities.\n\nBefore we discuss these rules, it will be helpful to keep in mind\nthree aggregative rules that operate under complete ignorance, i.e.,\nwhen we have no information whatsoever about the state of the world.\nThe first is maximin, which says to pick the option with the highest\nminimum utility. The second is maximax, which says to pick the option\nwith the highest maximum utility. The third, known as the Hurwicz\ncriterion, says to take a weighted average, for each option, of the\nminimum and maximum utility, where the weight \\(\\alpha \\in [0, 1]\\)\nrepresents a decision-maker\u2019s level of optimism/pessimism\n(Hurwicz 1951a): \n\n\\[\nH(f) = (1 - \\alpha)(\\text{min}_u(f)) + \\alpha(\\text{max}_u(f))\\]\n\n\nUsing the set-probability representation, we can associate to each\nprobability distribution an expected utility value, to yield a set of\nexpected utility values. Let \\(\\EU_p(f)\\) be the expected utility of\n\\(f\\) given probability distribution \\(p.\\)\n\nOne proposal is that the value of an act is its minimum expected\nutility value; thus, a decision-maker should maximize her minimum\nexpected utility (Wald 1950; Hurwicz 1951b; Good 1952; Gilboa\n& Schmeidler 1989): \n\n\\[\\text{\u0393-maximin}(f) = \\text{min}_p (\\EU_p(f))\\]\n\n\nThis rule is also sometimes known as MMEU. For the Ellsberg choices,\nthe minimum expected utilities are, for \\(f_1\\), \\(f_2\\), \\(f_3\\), and \\(f_4\\), respectively: \\(\\lfrac{1}{3},\\) \\(0,\\) \\(\\lfrac{1}{3},\\) and \\(\\lfrac{2}{3},\\). These values rationalize the common preference for \\(f_1 \\gt f_2\\) and \\(f_4 \\gt\nf_3.\\) Conversely, an individual who maximizes her maximum\nexpected utility\u2014who uses \u0393-maximax\u2014would have\nthe reverse preferences.\n\n\u0393-maximin appears too pessimistic. We might instead use an\nEU-analogue of Hurwicz criterion: take a weighted average of the\nminimum expected utility and the maximum expected utility, with\nweight \\(\\alpha \\in[0, 1]\\) corresponding to a decision-maker\u2019s\nlevel of pessimism (Hurwicz 1951b; Shackle 1952; Luce & Raiffa\n1957; Ellsberg 2001; Ghirardato et al. 2003): \n\n\\[\\alpha\\text{-maximin}(f) = (1 - \\alpha)(\\text{min}_p (\\EU_p (f))) + \\alpha(\\text{max}_p (\\EU_p(f)))\\]\n\n\nIn the Ellsberg choice, this model will assign\n\\(\\alpha(\\lfrac{2}{3})\\) to \\(f_2\\) and \\((1 - \\alpha)(\\lfrac{1}{3}) +\n\\alpha(1)\\) to \\(f_3,\\) making these acts disprefered to \\(f_1\\) and\n\\(f_4,\\) respectively, if \\(\\alpha \\lt \\lfrac{1}{2}\\); preferred to\n\\(f_1\\) and \\(f_4\\) if \\(\\alpha \\gt \\lfrac{1}{2}\\); and indifferent to\n\\(f_1\\) and \\(f_4\\) if \\(\\alpha = \\lfrac{1}{2}.\\)\n\nInstead, we can assume the decision-maker considers two quantities\nwhen evaluating an act: the EU of the act, according to her\n\u201cbest estimate\u201d at the probabilities (\\(\\text{est}_p),\\)\nand the minimum EU of the act as the probability ranges over \\(\\cQ\\);\nshe also assigns a degree of confidence \\(\\varrho \\in[0, 1]\\) to her\nestimated probability distribution. The value of an act will then be a\nweighted average of her best estimate EU and the minimum EU, with her\nbest estimate weighed by her degree of confidence (Hodges &\nLehmann 1952; Ellsberg 1961): \n\n\\[E(f) = \\varrho(\\text{est}_p (\\EU_p(f))) + (1 - \\varrho)(\\text{min}_p (\\EU_p(f)))\\]\n\n\nIn the Ellsberg pairs, assuming the \u201cbest estimate\u201d is\nthat yellow and black\neach have probability \\(\\lfrac{1}{3}\\), this will assign\n\\(\\varrho(\\lfrac{1}{3})\\) to \\(f_2\\) and \\(\\varrho(\\lfrac{2}{3}) + (1\n- \\varrho)(\\lfrac{1}{3})\\) to \\(f_3,\\) making these acts disprefered\nto \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_4,\\) respectively, as long as \\(\\varrho \\lt\n1.\\)\n\nWe can also combine these two proposals (Ellsberg 2001): \n\n\\[\nE(f) = \\varrho(\\text{est}_p \\EU_p(f)) + (1 - \\varrho)\n[(1 - \\alpha)(\\text{min}_p \\EU_p(f)) + \\alpha(\\text{max}_p \\EU_p(f))]\\]\n\n\nThis model will rationalize the common preferences for many choices of\n\\(\\varrho\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) (setting \\(\\varrho = 0\\) or \\(\\alpha = 0\\)\nyields previously-mentioned models).\n\nWe might add additional structure to the representation: to each\nprobability function, the decision-maker assigns a degree of\n\u201creliability\u201d, which tracks how much relevant information\nthe decision-maker has about the states of nature (Good 1952;\nG\u00e4rdenfors & Sahlin 1982). A decision-maker selects a desired\nthreshold level of epistemic reliability. She then considers all\nprobability functions above this threshold, and maximizes the minimum\nexpected utility (\u0393-maximin) with respect to these probability\nfunctions. (In principle, a different decision rule could be used in\nthis step.) For the decision-maker deciding whether to bet on tennis\nmatches, the above-threshold probability functions for the first match\nmay include only \\(p(P1 \\text{WINS}) \\approx 0.5,\\) but for the second\nand third match may also include \\(p(P1 \\text{WINS}) \\approx 0\\); thus\nbetting on P1 in the first match will have a higher value than betting\non P1 in the other matches.\n4.3.2 Aggregative Decision Rules: Choquet Expected Utility\n\nA different kind of rule is Choquet expected utility, also\nknown as cumulative utility (Schmeidler 1989; Gilboa 1987).\nThis rule starts with a function \\(v\\) which, like a probability\nfunction, obeys \\(v(E)\\in[0, 1],\\) \\(v(0) = 0,\\) \\(v(1) = 1,\\) and \\(A\n\\subseteq B\\) implies \\(v(A) \\le v(A).\\) Unlike a probability\nfunction, however, \\(v\\) is non-additive; and \\(v\\) is not\nstraightforwardly used to calculate an expectation. (Many economists\nrefer to this function as a \u201cnon-additive subjective probability\nfunction\u201d.). Choquet expected utility is a member of the\nrank-dependent family (Quiggin 1982, Yaari 1987, Kahneman\n& Tversky 1979, Tversky & Kahneman 1992, Wakker 2010).\nFunctions in this family let the weight of an event in an act\u2019s\noverall value depend on both the probability-like element and the\nevent\u2019s position in the ordering of an act, e.g., whether it is\nthe worst or best event for that act. Formally, let \\(g' = \\{E_1,\nx_1;\\ldots; E_n, x_n\\}\\) be a re-ordering of act \\(g\\) from worst\nevent to best event, so that \\(u(x_1) \\le \\ldots \\le u(x_n).\\) The\nChoquet expected utility of \\(g'\\) (and therefore of \\(g\\))\nis: \n\n\\[\n\\CEU(g') = u(x_{1}) + \\sum_{i = 2}^{n} v\\left(\\bigcup_{j = i}^{n} E_{j}\\right) \\left(u(x_{i}) - u(x_{i - 1})\\right)\\]\n\n\nIf \\(v\\) is additive, then \\(v\\) is an (additive) probability function\nand CEU reduces to EU. If \\(v\\) is convex \\((v(E) + v(F) \\le v(EF) +\nv(E v F)),\\) then the individual is uncertainty-averse.\n\nIn the Ellsberg example, we are given \\(p(\\RED) = \\lfrac{1}{3}\\) and\n\\(p(\\BLACK \\lor \\YELLOW) = \\lfrac{2}{3},\\) and so we can assume\n\\(v(\\RED) = \\lfrac{1}{3}\\) and \\(v(\\BLACK \\lor \\YELLOW) =\n\\lfrac{2}{3}.\\) A person who is \u201cambiguity averse\u201d will\nassign \\(v(\\BLACK) + v(\\YELLOW) \\le v(\\BLACK \\lor \\YELLOW)\\); let us\nassume \\(v(\\BLACK) = v(\\YELLOW) = \\lfrac{1}{9}.\\) Similarly, she will\nassign \\(v(\\RED \\lor \\YELLOW) + v(\\BLACK) \\le 1\\); let us assume\n\\(v(\\RED \\lor \\YELLOW) = \\lfrac{4}{9}.\\)\n\nThen the values of the acts will be: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\CEU(f_1) & = 0 + v(\\RED)(1 - 0) & = \\lfrac{1}{3}\\\\\n\\CEU(f_2) & = 0 + v(\\BLACK)(1 - 0) & = \\lfrac{1}{9}\\\\\n\\CEU(f_3) & = 0 + v(\\RED \\lor  \\YELLOW)(1 - 0) &= \\lfrac{4}{9}\\\\\n\\CEU(f_4) & = 0 + v(\\BLACK \\lor  \\YELLOW)(1 - 0) &= \\lfrac{2}{3}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThis assignment recovers the Ellsberg preferences.\n\nAxiomatizations of CEU use a restricted version of the separability\ncondition (the \u201cComonotonic\u201d Sure-thing Principle or\n\u201cComonotonic\u201d Tradeoff Consistency): namely, the condition\nonly holds when all of the acts in its domain are\ncomonotonic, i.e., when the worst-to-best ranking of the\nevents coincides for all the acts (Gilboa 1987, Schmeidler 1989,\nWakker 1989, Chew & Wakker 1996, K\u00f6bberling & Wakker\n2003; see also Wakker 2010, who also notes the relationship between\nCEU and \\(\\alpha\\)-maximin.)\n4.3.3 Decision Rules that Select from a Menu\n\nAnother different type of proposal focuses on selection of\npermissible options from a set of alternatives \\(\\cS,\\)\nrather than a complete ranking of options. As in\n section 3.3,\n we can imaginatively think of each possible probability distribution\nin a set \\(\\cQ\\) as a \u201ccommittee member\u201d, and posit a rule\nfor choice based on facts about the opinions of the committee. (The\nfirst three rules are versions of the rules for sets of utility\nfunctions in 3.3, and can be combined to cover sets of\nprobability/utility pairs.)\n\nThe first possibility is that a decision-maker is permitted to pick an\nact just in case some committee member is permitted to pick\nit over all the alternatives: just in case it maximizes expected\nutility relative to some probability function in the set.\nThis is known as E-admissibility (Levi 1974, 1983, 1986;\nSeidenfeld, Schervish, & Kadane 2010): \n\n\\[\n\\text{Permissible choice set } = \\{A \\mid (\\exists p\\in\\cQ )(\\forall B \\in \\cS)(\\EU_p(A) \\ge \\EU_p(B))\\}\\]\n\n\nLevi in fact tells a more complicated story about what a\ndecision-maker is permitted to choose, in terms of a procedure that\nrules out successively more and more options. First, the procedure\nselects from all the options just the ones that are E-admissible.\nNext, the procedure selects from the E-admissible options just the\nones that are P-admissible: options that \u201cdo\nbest\u201d at preserving the E-admissible options (the idea being\nthat a rational agent should keep her options open). Finally, the\nprocedure selects from the P-admissible options just the ones that are\nS-admissible: options that maximize the minimum utility.\n(Note that this last step involves maximin, not \u0393-maximin.)\n\nA more permissive rule than E-admissibility permits a choice as long\nthere is no particular alternative that the committee members\nunanimously (strictly) prefer. As in the case of\nutility-sets, this rule is known as maximality (Walley\n1991): \n\n\\[\n\\text{Permissible choice set } = \\{A \\mid (\\forall B\\in\\cS)(\\exists p \\in\\cQ )(\\EU_p(A) \\ge \\EU_p (B))\\}\\]\n\n\n(See\n section 3.3\n for an example of the difference between E-admissibility and\nmaximality.)\n\nMore permissive still is the rule that a choice is permissible as long\nas it is not interval dominated (Schick 1979, Kyburg 1983):\nits maximum value isn\u2019t lower than the minimum value of some\nother act. \n\n\\[\\text{Permissible choice set } = \\{A \\mid (\\forall B\\in \\cS)(\\text{max}_p \\EU_p(A) \\ge \\text{min}_p \\EU_p(B))\\}\\]\n\n\nFor a proof showing that \u0393-maximax implies E-admissibility;\n\u0393-maximin implies maximality; E-admissibility implies\nmaximality; and maximality implies interval dominance, see Troffaes\n(2007).\n\nA final approach is to interpret ambiguity as indeterminacy: one\ncommittee member has the \u201ctrue\u201d probability function, but\nit is indeterminate which one. If all probability functions agree that\nan option is permissible to choose, then it is determinately\npermissible to choose; if all agree that it is impermissible to\nchoose, it is determinately impermissible to choose; and if some hold\nthat it is permissible and others hold that it is impermissible, it is\nindeterminate whether it is permissible (Rinard 2015).\n\nThese rules in this section allow but do not obviously\nexplain the Ellsberg choices unless supplemented by an\nadditional rule (e.g., Levi\u2019s more complicated story or one of\nthe rules from\n section 4.3.1),\n since any choice between \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) and between \\(f_3\\) and\n\\(f_4\\) appears to be E-admissible, maximal, and\nnon-interval-dominated.\n4.4 Normative Questions\n\nFor those who favor non-sharp probabilities, two sets of normative\nquestions arise. The first set is epistemic: whether it is epistemically rational not\nto have sharp probabilities (White 2009; Elga 2010; Joyce 2011;\nH\u00e1jek & Smithson 2012; Seidenfeld et al. 2012; Mayo-Wilson\n& Wheeler 2016; Schoenfield 2017; Vallinder 2018; Builes et al 2022; Konek\nms. \u2013 see Other Internet Resources).\n\nThe second set of questions question is practical. Some hold that ambiguity aversion is not well-motivated by practical reasons and so we have no reason to account for it (Schoenfield 2020). Others hold that some particular decision rule associated with non-sharp probabilities leads to bad consequences, e.g., in virtue of running afoul of the principles mentioned in\n section 1.2.3. Of particular interest is how\nthese decision rules can be extended to sequential choice (Seidenfeld\n1988a,b; Seidenfeld et al. 1990;\nElga 2010; Bradley and Steele 2014; Chandler 2014; Moss 2015; Sud 2014; Rinard 2015).\n5. Risk Aversion\n5.1 The Challenge from Risk Aversion\n\nA final challenge to expected utility maximization is to the norm\nitself\u2014to the idea that a gamble should be valued at its\nexpectation. In particular, some claim that it is rationally\npermissible for individuals to be risk-averse (or risk-seeking) in a\nsense that conflicts with EU maximization.\n\nSay that an individual is risk-averse in money (or any\nnumerical good) if she prefers the consequences of a gamble to be less\n\u201cspread out\u201d; this concept is made precise by Rothschild\nand Stiglitz\u2019s idea of dispreferring mean-preserving\nspreads (1972). As a special case of this, a person who is\nrisk-averse in money will prefer \\(\\$x\\) to any gamble whose mean\nmonetary value is \\(\\$x.\\) If an EU maximizer is risk-averse in money,\nthen her utility function will be concave (it diminishes marginally,\ni.e., each additional dollar adds less utility than the previous\ndollar); if an EU maximizer is risk-seeking in money, then her utility\nfunction will be convex (Rothschild & Stiglitz 1972). Therefore,\nEU theory equates risk-aversion with having a diminishing marginal\nutility function.\n\nHowever, there are intuitively at least two different reasons that\nsomeone might have for being risk-averse. Consider a person who loves\ncoffee but cannot tolerate more than one cup. Consider another person\nwhose tolerance is very high, such that the first several cups are\neach as pleasurable as the last, but who has a particular attitude\ntowards risk: it would take a very valuable upside in order for her to\ngive up a guaranteed minimum number of cups. Both will prefer 1 cup of\ncoffee to a coin-flip between 0 and 2, but intuitively they value cups\nof coffee very differently, and have very different reasons for their\npreference. This example generalizes: we might consider a person who\nis easily saturated with respect to money (once she has a bit of\nmoney, each additional bit matters less and less to her); and another\nperson who is a miser\u2014he likes each dollar just as much as the\nlast\u2014but nonetheless has the same attitude towards gambling as\nour coffee drinker. Both will disprefer mean-preserving spreads, but\nintuitively have different attitudes towards money and different\nreasons for this preference. Call the attitude of the second person in\neach pair global sensitivity (Allais 1953, Watkins 1977,\nYaari 1987, Hansson 1988, Buchak 2013).\n\nThis kind of example gives rise to several problems. First, if EU\nmaximization is supposed to explain why someone made a\nparticular choice, it ought to be able to distinguish these two\nreasons for preference; but if global sensitivity can be captured at\nall, it will have to be captured by a diminishing marginal utility\nfunction, identical to that of the first person in each pair. Second,\nif one adopts a view of the utility function according to which the\ndecision-maker has introspective access to it, a decision-maker might\nreport that she has preferences like the tolerant coffee drinker or\nthe miser\u2014her utility function is linear\u2014but nonetheless\nif she maximizes EU her utility function will have to be concave; so\nEU maximization will get her utility function wrong. Finally, even if\none holds that a decision-maker does not have introspective access to\nher utility function, if a decision-maker displays global sensitivity,\nthen she will have some preferences that cannot be captured by an\nexpectational utility function (Allais 1953, Hansson 1988, Buchak\n2013).\n\nA related worry displays a troubling implication of EU\nmaximization\u2019s equating risk-aversion with diminishing marginal\nutility. Rabin\u2019s (2000) Calibration Theorem shows that\nif an EU-maximizer is mildly risk-averse in modest-stakes gambles, she\nwill have to be absurdly risk-averse in high-stakes gambles. For\nexample, if an individual would reject the gamble {\u2212$100, 0.5;\n$110, 0.5} at any wealth level, then she must also reject the gamble\n{\u2212$1000, 0.5; $n, 0.5} for any \\(n\\) whatsoever.\n\nFinally, the Allais Paradox identifies a set of preferences\nthat are intuitive but cannot be captured by any expectational utility\nfunction (Allais 1953). Consider the choice between the following two\nlotteries:\n\n\\(L_1 : \\{\\$5,000,000, 0.1; $0, 0.9\\}\\)\n\\(L_2 : \\{\\$1,000,000, 0.11; \\$0, 0.89\\}\\)\n\n\nSeparately, consider the choice between the following two\nlotteries:\n\n\\(L_3 : \\{\\$1,000,000, 0.89; \\$5,000,000, 0.1; \\$0, 0.01\\}\\)\n\\(L_4 : \\{\\$1,000,000, 1\\}\\)\n\n\nMost people (strictly) prefer \\(L_1\\) to \\(L_2,\\) and (strictly)\nprefer \\(L_4\\) to \\(L_3,\\) but there are no values \\(u(\\$0),\\)\n\\(u(\\$1\\rM),\\) and \\(u(\\$5\\rM)\\) such that \\(\\EU(L_1) \\gt \\EU(L_2)\\)\nand \\(\\EU(L_4) \\gt \\EU(L_3).\\) The Allais preferences violate the\nIndependence Axiom; when the lotteries are suitably reframed as acts\n(e.g., defined over events such as the drawing of a 100-ticket\nlottery), they violate the Sure-thing Principle or related\nseparability principles.\n5.2 Proposals\n\nThere have been a number of descriptive attempts to explain global\nsensitivity, by those who are either uninterested in normative\nquestions or assume that EU is the correct normative theory. The most\nwell-known of these are prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky 1979;\nTversky & Kahneman 1992) and generalized utility theory (Machina\n1982, 1983, 1987); others are mentioned in the discussion below. See\nStarmer (2000) for an overview.\n\nSome normative proposals seek to accommodate global sensitivity\nwithin expected utility theory, by making the inputs of the\nutility function more fine-grained. Proponents of this\n\u201crefinement strategy\u201d hold that decision-makers prefer\n\\(L_4\\) to \\(L_3\\) because the $0 outcome in \\(L_3\\) would induce\nregret that one forewent a sure $1M (alternatively, because \\(L_4\\)\nincludes psychological certainty) and therefore that the\nconsequence-descriptions should include these facts. Thus, the correct\ndescription of \\(L_3\\) is: \n\n\\[L_3 : \\{\\$1,000,000, 0.89; \\$5,000,000, 0.1; \\$0 \\textit{ and regret, } 0.01\\}\\]\n\n\nOnce these gambles are correctly described, there is no direct\nconflict with EU maximization (Raiffa 1986, Weirich 1986, Schick 1991,\nBroome 1991, Berm\u00fadez 2009, Pettigrew 2015, Buchak 2015). The\nproblem of when two outcomes that appear the same should be\ndistinguished is taken up by Broome (1991), Pettit (1991), and Dreier\n(1996).\n\nThe thought that the value of a consequence depends on what might have\nbeen is systematized by Bradley and Stef\u00e1nsson (2017). Their\nproposal uses a version of expected utility theory developed by\nJeffrey (1965) and axiomatized by Bolker (1966). Jeffrey replaces the\nutility function by a more general \u201cdesirability\u201d function\nDes, which applies not just to consequences but also to prospects;\nindeed, it doesn\u2019t distinguish between \u201cultimate\u201d\nconsequences and prospects, since its inputs are propositions. Bradley\nand Stef\u00e1nsson propose to widen the domain of Des to include\ncounterfactual propositions, thus allowing that preferences for\npropositions can depend on counterfacts. For example, a decision-maker\ncan prefer \u201cI choose the risky options and get nothing, and I\nwouldn\u201dt have been guaranteed anything if I had chosen\ndifferently\u2019 to \u201cI choose the risky option and get\nnothing, and I would have been guaranteed something if I had chosen\ndifferently\u201d, which will rationalize the Allais preferences.\n(Incidentally, their proposal can also rationalize preferences that\nseemingly violate EU because of fairness considerations, as in an\nexample from Diamond (1967).)\n\nIn a different series of articles (Stef\u00e1nsson & Bradley\n2015, 2019), these authors again employ Jeffrey\u2019s framework, but\nthis time widen the domain of Des to include chance\npropositions (in addition to factual prospects), propositions\nlike \u201cthe chance that I get $100 is 0.5\u201d. They hold that a\nrational decision-maker can have a preference between various chances\nof \\(X,\\) even on the supposition that \\(X\\) obtains (she need not\nobey \u201cChance Neutrality\u201d). They capture the idea of\ndisliking risk as such by holding that even though a rational agent\nmust maximize expected desirability, she need not have a \\(\\Des\\)\nfunction of \\(X\\) that is expectational with respect to the Des\nfunction of chance propositions about \\(X\\) (she need not obey\n\u201cLinearity\u201d). For example, \\(\\Des(\\text{\u201cI get\n\\$100\u201d})\\) need not be equal to \\(2(\\Des(\\text{\u201cthe chance\nthat I get \\$100 is 0.5\u201d})).\\) (This does not conflict with\nmaximizing expected desirability, because it concerns only the\nrelationship between particular inputs to the \\(\\Des\\) function, and\ndoes not concern the decision-maker\u2019s subjective\nprobabilities.). This proposal can also rationalize the Ellsberg\npreferences\n (section 4.1),\n because it allows the decision-maker to assign different\nprobabilities to the various chance propositions (see also Bradley\n2015).\n\nOther proposals hold that we should reject the aggregation norm of\nexpected utility. The earliest of these came from Allais himself, who\nheld that decision-makers care not just about the mean utility of a\ngamble, but also about the dispersion of values. He proposes that\nindividuals maximize expected utility plus a measure of the riskiness\nof a gamble, which consists in a multiple of the standard deviation of\nthe gamble and a multiple of its skewness. Formally, if \\(s\\) stands\nfor the standard deviation of \\(L\\) and \\(m\\) stands for the skewness\nof \\(L,\\) then the utility value of \\(L\\) will be (Allais 1953, Hagen\n1979): \n\n\\[\\text{AH}(L) = \\EU(L) + F(s, m/s^2) + \\varepsilon\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\varepsilon\\) is an error term. He thus proposes that\nriskiness is an independently valuable property of a gamble, to be\ncombined with (and traded off against) its expected utility. This\nproposal essentially treats the riskiness of a gamble as a property\nthat is (dis)valuable in itself (see also Nozick 1993 on symbolic\nutility).\n\nA final approach treats global sensitivity as a feature of the\ndecision-maker\u2019s way of aggregating utility values. It might be\nthat a decision-maker\u2019s utility and probability function are not\nyet enough to tell us what he should prefer; he must also decide how\nmuch weight to give to what happens in worse states versus what\nhappens in better states. In risk-weighted expected utility\n(Buchak 2013), a generalization of Quiggin\u2019s (1982)\nanticipated utility and a member of the rank-dependent family\n(see\n section 4.3.2),\n this decision is represented by his risk function.\n\nFormally, let \\(g' = \\{E_1, x_1;\\ldots; E_n, x_n\\}\\) be a re-ordering\nof act \\(g\\) from worst event to best event, so that \\(u(x_1) \\le\n\\ldots \\le u(x_n).\\) Then the risk-weighted expected utility\nof \\(g\\) is: \n\n\\[\n\\REU (g') = u(x_{1}) + \\sum_{i = 2}^{n} r\n\\left(\\sum_{j = i}^{n} p(E_{j})\\right) \\left(u(x_{i}) - u( x_{i - 1})\\right)\\]\n\n\nwith \\(0 \\le r(p) \\le 1,\\) \\(r(0) = 0\\) and \\(r(1) = 1,\\) and \\(r(p)\\)\nnon-decreasing.\n\nThe risk function measures the weight of the top \\(p\\)-portion of\nconsequences in the evaluation of an act\u2014how much the\ndecision-maker cares about benefits that obtain only in the top\n\\(p\\)-portion of states. (One could also think of the risk function as\ndescribing the solution to a distributive justice problem among\none\u2019s future possible selves\u2014it says how much weight a\ndecision-maker gives to the interests of the top \\(p\\)-portion of his\nfuture possible selves.) A risk-avoidant person is someone\nwith a convex risk function: as benefits obtain in a smaller and\nsmaller portion of states, he gives proportionally less and less\nweight to them. A risk-inclined person is someone with a\nconcave risk function. And a globally neutral person is\nsomeone with a linear risk function, i.e., an EU maximizer.\n\nDiminishing marginal value and global sensitivity are captured,\nrespectively, by the utility function and the risk function.\nFurthermore, the Allais preferences can be accommodated by a convex\nrisk function (Segal 1987, Prelec 1998, Buchak 2013; but see Thoma\n& Weisberg 2017). Thus, REU maximization holds that\ndecision-makers have the Allais preferences because they care more\nabout what happens in worse scenarios than better scenarios, or are\nmore concerned with the minimum value than potential gains above the\nminimum.\n\nThe representation theorem for REU combines conditions from two\nexisting theorems (Machina & Schmeidler 1992, K\u00f6bberling and\nWakker 2003), replacing the separability condition with two weaker\nconditions. One of these conditions fixes a unique probability\nfunction of events (Machina & Schmeidler\u2019s \u201cStrong\nComparative Probability\u201d, 1992) and the other fixes a unique\nrisk function of probabilities; the latter is a restricted version of\nthe separability condition (K\u00f6bberling & Wakker\u2019s\n[2003] \u201cComonotonic\u201d Tradeoff Consistency; see\n section 4.3.2).\n Since the representation theorem derives a unique probability\nfunction, a unique risk function, and a unique (up to positive affine\ntransformation) utility function, it separates the contribution of\ndiminishing marginal value and global sensitivity to a given\npreference ordering. One can disprefer mean-preserving spreads as a\nresult of either type of risk-aversion, or a combination of both.\n5.3 Normative Issues\n\nProposals that seek to retain EU but refine the outcome space face two\nparticular worries. One of these is that the constraints of decision\ntheory end up trivial (Dreier 1996); the other is that they saddle the\ndecision-maker with preferences over impossible objects (Broome\n1991).\n\nFor theories that reject the Sure-thing Principle or the Independence\nAxiom, several potential worries arise, including the worry that these\naxioms are intuitively correct (Harsanyi 1977, Savage 1954, Samuelson\n1952; see discussion in McClennen 1983, 1990); that decision-makers\nwill evaluate consequences inconsistently (Samuelson 1952, Broome\n1991); and that decision-makers will reject cost-free information\n(Good 1967, Wakker 1988, Buchak 2013, Ahmed & Salow 2019,\nCampbell-Moore & Salow 2020). The most widely discussed worry is\nthat these theories will leave decision-makers open to diachronic\ninconsistency (Raiffa 1968; Machina 1989; Hammond 1988; McClennen\n1988, 1990; Seidenfeld 1988a,b; Maher 1993; Rabinowicz 1995, 1997;\nBuchak 2013, 2015, 2017; Briggs 2015; Joyce 2017; Thoma 2019).",
