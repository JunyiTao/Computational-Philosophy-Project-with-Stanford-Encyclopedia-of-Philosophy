    "main_text": "What is a social minimum? || An ecumenical-capabilities conception of the social minimum?\n1.2 An ecumenical-capabilities conception of the social minimum?\n\nTo adopt the capability approach, however, we do need to address the\nobjection that it is potentially sectarian: to avoid the\nproblem of resource-\u201cfetishism\u201d, it asks us to consider\nwhether or not people have certain specific capabilities that are\nallegedly central to the good life, but there is then a danger of\nspecifying a list that some regard as too biased towards one ethical\ndoctrine or societal culture than another \u2013 an issue which is perhaps\neven more pressing if we are considering a social minimum at a\ntransnational or global level. One response to this apparent dilemma\nis to try to develop a self-consciously \u201cecumenical\u201d\nversion of the approach. Aware of the danger of sectarianism, the\ncapabilities theorist seeks to identify capabilities that are\ngenuinely important to people across a wide range of reasonable\nethical doctrines and societal cultures; and they seek to find ways to\nmake the application of the approach sensitive to ethical and cultural\ndiversity. Such an approach offers one way of elaborating what we mean\nby a social minimum: the resources necessary for a person to lead a\n\u201cminimally decent life in their society\u201d can be understood\nas the resources necessary to hold a specified range of\necumenically significant capabilities, taking due account of\nthe society\u2019s understanding of how these capabilities are typically\nrealized.\n\nAn approach of this kind has been developed by Martha Nussbaum (see\nespecially Nussbaum 1990, 1992, 1999, 2000, 2007). Nussbaum believes\nwe can identify a set of vitally important capabilities by posing the\nquestion:\n\n\nWhat activities characteristically performed by human beings are so\ncentral that they seem constitutive of a life that is truly human?\n(Nussbaum 1999: 39)\n\n\nMore concretely: What activities and related capabilities seem\nimportant to us when we consider whether someone who has undergone a\nmajor change in their capacities is still capable of a human life?\nWhat activities and related capabilities are important to people when\nthey differentiate between the human and the non-human (sub-human or\nsuperhuman) in, say, constructing stories? Proceeding inductively\nthrough reflection on these questions, Nussbaum claims to identify a\nrange of \u201ccentral human functional capabilities\u201d,\ncapabilities people must have if they are to be able to live a truly\nhuman life. These include (for more details, see Nussbaum 1999:\n40\u201341):\n\nthe capability for physical survival;\nthe capability for bodily health;\nthe capability for bodily integrity;\nthe capability for the exercise of imagination;\nthe capability for emotional response and exploration;\nthe capability for practical reason;\nthe capability for love and friendship;\nthe capability for connection with nature and other species;\nthe capability for play;\nthe capability for the exercise of control over environment,\nincluding political control.\n\n\nAdopting this approach, then, we would elaborate the concept of the\nsocial minimum by agreeing on a specific list of capabilities, such as\nthat above, as necessary to a \u201cminimally decent life\u201d, and\nby working out the kinds and levels of resources that people need to\nhave these capabilities to an adequate extent. The above list is\nclearly pitched at a high level of generality, and so it will make\nsense in applying this approach to consider how the various\ncapabilities are typically manifested in particular national\nsocieties. At the same time, such a list arguably provides a safeguard\nagainst excessive cultural relativism in thinking about the social\nminimum. If we can see no way in which a given capability on the list\nis adequately satisfied for a given group, then we must conclude that\nthe society is denying these people the opportunity to lead a\n\u201cminimally decent life\u201d. The idea of the social minimum\ncan in this way have some critical bite in evaluating existing social\narrangements.\n\nOne important complicating factor must be noted here. Consider item\n(2) on Nussbaum\u2019s list, the capability for bodily health. What does it\nmean for people to have this capability to an adequate\nextent? There is, after all, probably no limit to how far a\nsociety could go in increasing this capability for its members by\ndevoting more and more of its resources to this end. At what point can\nwe say that it is doing enough? This is the problem of\nlimit-setting: the problem of determining in a fair way, and\nin a way that has legitimacy for those concerned, just what level of\ncoverage for a given capability is satisfactory, given the commitment\nto ensure that everyone has reasonable access to the resources\nnecessary for a minimally decent life. We shall not consider this\nproblem further here, but we will return to it in section\n 3.3\n below.\n\nWe should note that Nussbaum\u2019s attempt to define a determinate list of\nkey or basic capabilities like the above is controversial. Critics\nobject that the approach is too rooted in a theorist\u2019s specific vision\nof what is valuable in a human life, and that it may therefore be not\nsensitive enough to reasonable differences of view (for discussion,\nsee Robeyns 2005, 2006). Similar approaches to Nussbaum\u2019s, which\nemploy the notion of \u201chuman needs\u201d, have similarly\ncontroversial elements (see especially Doyal and Gough\n 1991).[1]\n But some disagreement of this kind seems unavoidable when we try to\nspecify a standard for judging whether people enjoy a \u201cminimally\ndecent life\u201d. Along with the problem of limit-setting, this\ncreates a potential problem of political legitimacy in the\nspecification and enactment of the social minimum to which we shall\nreturn below (see section\n 3.3).\n An important challenge in practice is to steer a course between an\noverly prescriptive listing of desirable capabilities by, say,\nacademic philosophers and an overly subjective listing that might be\nprone to problems such as adaptive preferences (for helpful\ndiscussions, see Robeyns 2005, 2006, Wolff and De-Shalit 2007, and\nClaassen 2020).\n",
