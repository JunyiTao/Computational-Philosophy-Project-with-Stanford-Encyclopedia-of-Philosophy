    "main_text": "Historical background\n1. Historical background\n\nKant had held that both arithmetic and (Euclidean) geometry were\nsynthetic a priori, just as\u2014for him\u2014metaphysics\nwas. Indeed, this was to explain the special status of both\nmathematics and metaphysics, so that the latter could enjoy the\nexalted status of the former. For Kant, both mathematics and\nmetaphysics afforded informative insights into the nature of reality\n(they were synthetic); yet, for all that, the rational intellect\nneeded no sensory experience in order to attain such insights (they\nwere a priori). On Kant\u2019s account, even a simple\ncomputational statement of arithmetic\u2014let alone a statement\ninvolving quantification over the natural numbers\u2014is synthetic.\nHere is how he put the matter in his Critique of Pure Reason,\nat B16:\n\n\nWe might, indeed, at first suppose that the proposition \\(7 + 5 = 12\\)\nis a merely analytical proposition, and follows by the principle of\ncontradiction from the concept of a sum of \\(7\\) and \\(5\\). But if we\nlook more closely we find that the concept of the sum of \\(7\\) and\n\\(5\\) contains nothing save the union of the two numbers into one, and\nin this no thought is being taken as to what that single number may be\nwhich combines both. The concept of \\(12\\) is by no means already\nthought in merely thinking this union of \\(7\\) and \\(5\\); and I may\nanalyze my concept of such a possible sum as long as I please, still I\nshall never find the \\(12\\) in it. (Translation by Norman Kemp\nSmith)\n\n\nKant\u2019s search for conceptual containments is confined to those\nthat he might be able to find among just the explicit constituents of\nthe proposition concerned, unmediated by any connections with related\nconcepts that do not themselves occur within the proposition. (We note\nthis in anticipation of a contrast to be made in due course with\nFrege\u2019s modification of Kant\u2019s conception of analytic\n truth.)[3]\n For Kant, the a priori character of arithmetical truth\nderives not from conceptual containments (within the proposition in\nquestion), but from the pure form of our intuition of time,\nas affording an unbounded series of successive moments. According to\nMichael Friedman, Kant held that\n\n\nonly the general features of succession and iteration in time can\nguarantee the existence and uniqueness of the sum of \\(7\\) and \\(5\\)\n\u2026; only the unboundedness of temporal succession can guarantee\nthe infinity of the number series, and so on\n \u2026.[4]\n\n\nLikewise, on Kant\u2019s account, the a priori character of\nEuclidean geometry derives from the pure form of our intuition of\nspace, which enables the thinker, correctly one may presume, to\nintuit straight lines in space as continuous.\n\nThese two pure forms of intuition\u2014time and\nspace\u2014delivered, for Kant, the theories of arithmetic and\nEuclidean geometry respectively, and endowed them both with their\na priori character. And they made possible the\nspatio-temporal manifold of intuitions (Anschauungen) which\nwould then in turn, upon structuring by the exercise of concepts of\nthe understanding (especially the concepts of substance and\ncause) make possible objective knowledge of things and events\nin the external world.\n\nThe logicists, then, could be seen as adopting Kant\u2019s\ndistinction, but applying it to radically different effect. Their\nfirst move was to argue that arithmetic, at least, is\nanalytic, not synthetic.\n\nThe doctrine of logicism had its first glimmerings in the writings of\nDedekind, but it really only came to full flowering in the work of\nFrege. In Dedekind\u2019s work, the ideas were presented in a form\naccessible to his contemporaries in the mathematical community.\nPrecise and rigorous though those ideas were, they nevertheless\nenjoyed a relatively informal presentation. No one had yet come up\nwith the idea of formal deductive systems of logic adequate for\nformalizing the mathematical reasoning of their day; so no logicist\nthesis in Dedekind\u2019s day could be formulated in the way that is\nnow familiar to us. Matters were different, of course, with Frege, for\nhis crowning achievement was a formal deductive system of logic by\nreference to which a logicist thesis could at last be expressed.\n\nNow, when crediting Frege also with the pioneering of a detailed\nexecution of a logicist program, one cannot ignore his continuing\ninsistence that the truths of Euclidean geometry were synthetic a\npriori, and founded in a completely different way from the truths\nof\n arithmetic.[5]\n Hence they were not subject to his doctrine of logicism. This is why\nwe have exercised care in our introductory characterization of the\ndoctrine of logicism, as concerned first and foremost with the truths\nof arithmetic and of real analysis.\n\nThe combined contributions of Dedekind and Frege represented a\nculmination of the trend, by their time well under way among leading\nmathematicians, towards the arithmetization of real (and\ncomplex) analysis. This trend had its beginnings in the even earlier\nworks of Gauss and Bolzano. It came to maturity in the works of Cauchy\nand Weierstra\u00df, and became the dominant paradigm in Western\nthought about the nature of mathematics. The leading idea of the\narithmetizers was that the concepts and first principles of arithmetic\nand analysis are to be found in the concepts of the understanding (as\na Kantian might put it), independently of one\u2019s geometric\nintuitions concerning any spatial or temporal continua. Arithmetic and\nanalysis are completely conceptual and logical in\ntheir axiomatic sources and in their deductive development.\n\nWe proceed now to consider Dedekind and Frege in turn.\n",
