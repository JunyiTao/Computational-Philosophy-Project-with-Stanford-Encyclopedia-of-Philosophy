    "main_text": "Modeling the Parties || Homogeneity vs. Heterogeneity\n2.3 Homogeneity vs. Heterogeneity \n\nSocial contract theories model representative choosers (N) so\nas to render the choice situation determinate. This goal of\ndeterminacy, however, can have the effect of eliminating the pluralism\nof the parties that was the original impetus for contracting in the\nfirst place. In his Lectures on the History of Political\nPhilosophy Rawls tells us that \u201ca normalization of\ninterests attributed to the parties\u201d is \u201ccommon to social\ncontract doctrines\u201d and it is necessary to unify the\nperspectives of the different parties so as to construct a\n\u201cshared point of view\u201d (2007, 226). Here Rawls seems to be\nsuggesting that to achieve determinacy in the contract procedure it is\nnecessary to \u201cnormalize\u201d the perspectives of the\nparties.\n\nThe problem is this. Suppose that the parties to the contract closely\nmodel real agents, and so they have diverse bases for their\ndeliberations\u2014religious, secular, perfectionist, and so on. In\nthis case, it is hard to see how the contract theorist can get a\ndeterminate result. Just as you and I disagree, so will the parties.\nRawls (1999, 121) acknowledges that his restrictions on particular\ninformation in the original position are necessary to achieve a\ndeterminate result. If we exclude \u201cknowledge of those\ncontingencies which set men at odds \u2026. \u201d then since\n\u201ceveryone is equally rational and similarly situated, each is\nconvinced by the same arguments\u201d(Rawls 1999, 17, 120). Gaus\n(2011a, 36\u201347) has argued that a determinative result can only\nbe generated by an implausibly high degree of abstraction, in which\nthe basic pluralism of evaluative standards\u2014the core of our\njustificatory problem\u2014is abstracted away. Thus, on Gaus\u2019s\nview, modelings of the parties that make them anything approaching\nrepresentations of real people will only be able to generate a\nnon-singleton set of eligible social contracts. The parties might\nagree that some social contracts are better than none, but they will\ndisagree on their ordering of possible social contracts. This\nconclusion, refined and developed in (Gaus 2011a, Part Two) connects\nthe traditional problem of indeterminacy in the contract procedure\n(see also Hardin 2003) with the contemporary, technical problem of\nequilibrium selection in games (see Vanderschraaf 2005). A topic we\nwill explore more in \u00a73 below.\n\nIt is possible, however, that determinacy may actually require\ndiversity in the perspective of the deliberative parties in a way that\nRawls and others like Harsanyi didn\u2019t expect. The reason for\nthis is simple, though the proof is somewhat complex. Normalizing the\nperspectives of the parties assumes that there is one stable point of\nview that has all of the relevant information necessary for generating\na stable and determinate set of social rules. There is no reason,\nantecedently, to think that such a perspective can be found, however.\nInstead, if we recognize that there are epistemic gains to be had from\na \u201cdivision of cognitive labor\u201d there is good reason to\nprefer a diverse rather than normalized idealization of the parties to\nthe contract (see: Weisberg and Muldoon 2009, Gaus 2016, Muldoon 2017,\nMuldoon 2017a, Muldoon 2018). There is reason to conclude that if we\nwish to discover social contracts that best achieve a set of\ninterrelated normative desiderata (e.g., liberty, equality, welfare,\netc.), a deliberative process that draws on a diversity of\nperspectives will outperform one based on a strict normalization of\nperspectives (Gaus 2011b, 2016; Thrasher 2020).\n",
