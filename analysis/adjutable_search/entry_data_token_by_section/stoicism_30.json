    "main_text": "Influence || On Christian Writers\n5.2 On Christian Writers\n\nChristian writers were receptive to some elements of Stoicism. There\nexists an inauthentic correspondence between St Paul and Seneca\nincluded in the Apocrypha. This forgery is a very ancient one, since\nit was referred to in both Jerome (De Viris Illustribus 12)\nand Augustine (Epistle 153.4). But the fact that the letters\nwere not written by Paul or by Seneca does not mean that Paul was\nunaware of Stoic philosophy, nor that his own thought may not be\nunderstood in relation to Stoic theory, cf. Engberg-Pedersen 2000. The\ntradition of theories of natural law in ethics seems to stem directly\nfrom Stoicism. (Compare Cicero, De Legibus 1.18 with later\nwriters like Aquinas in Summa Theologica II, 2, q. 94.)\nAugustine chose to follow the Stoics rather than the Platonists (his\nusual allies among the philosophers) on a number of points, including\non the question of animals\u2019 membership in the moral community\n(City of God 1.20) and in his philosophy of language. Sorabji\n2000, part IV, argues that the Stoic idea of freedom from the passions\nwas adapted and transmuted into the idea of seven deadly sins by\nEvagrius. In general, see Colish 1985 for the presence of Stoicism in\nLatin writers through the sixth century.\n\nThe influence of Stoicism on Medieval thought has been considered by\nVerbeke 1983. In general, the handling of Stoic ideas in the context\nof Christian orthodoxy required a certain delicacy. While it was\nagreed by nearly all that God was not a material being, the state of\nthe human soul was a more controversial matter. In general, ancient\nChristian orthodoxy evolved away from materialist anthropology of the\nsort found in Tertullian to the immaterialist notion of the soul that\npresent-day Christians take for granted. Medieval Christians felt it\nnecessary to reject what they called Stoic fatalism, but notions of\nconscience and natural law had clear connections with Stoic\nthought.\n",
