    "main_text": "Objections || The Integrity Objection\n6.4 The Integrity Objection\n\nSome say public justification imposes excessive burdens on people of\nfaith. By barring unshared reasons, it excludes religious reasons from\npublic discourse. Critics say people of faith have no reason to accept\nthose constraints. (Eberle 2002, Wolterstorff 1997, Vallier 2014). The\nconstraints, if followed, would divide the identity of religious\npeople, and the person of faith\u2019s identity may disintegrate.\n\nThe integrity objection relates to a fairness objection. This\nobjection claims that public justification prioritizes secular over\nreligious reasons, arbitrarily preferring secular citizens. (Perry\n1993, Wolterstorff 1997). Note that convergence undermines these\nobjections as it allows appeals to religious reasons. (Eberle 2012).\nThe integrity objection also relates to the Denial of Truth objection\n(Neal 2009). Neal thinks citizens who abide by public justification\ncannot appeal to the truth as they see it. Andrew March (2013)\nprovides a taxonomy of religion-based criticisms of public reason. He\nargues that some restrictions can burden us too much. But other\nconditions are justified.\n6.4.1 The Antidiscourse Objection\n\nPublic justification might also support unrealistic views of\ndemocratic politics because real politics uses personal reasons to\nbuild coalitions and forge compromises (Shapiro 1999). This objection\nfocuses on the burdensomeness of public reason, but it also concerns\nwhether public reason is realistic. Note that the antidiscourse\nobjection threatens discursive views of public justification.\n6.4.2 The Marginalization Objection\n\nSome critics argue that public justification privileges logical, calm,\ndispassionate forms of discourse. There may be minority groups that do\nnot find such speech rules satisfactory. (It is a matter of\ncontroversy who these minority groups are.) The objection mirrors the\nintegrity objection, but they apply to different social groups.\n(Sanders 1997, Young 2000). These critics oppose Rawlsian\ninterpretations of the PJP.\n",
