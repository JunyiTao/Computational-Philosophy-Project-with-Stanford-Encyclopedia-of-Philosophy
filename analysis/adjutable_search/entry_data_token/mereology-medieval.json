Forums for medieval mereology\n\nOne can find discussions of parts and wholes throughout the medieval\nphilosophical and theological literature. But there are two places\nwhere the student of medieval mereology can reliably look to find\nsustained reflections on parts and wholes as such, namely, treatments\nof division and the Topics. The main authority on division and the\nTopics is the Roman philosopher\n Boethius\n (c. 480\u2013524 C.E.). Boethius is now most famous for his\nConsolation of Philosophy, but his influence on medieval\nphilosophy is as much due to his commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories and On Interpretation, his theological\ntreatises, and his handbooks on logic (see Chadwick 1981 and Marenbon\n2003). Boethius\u2019 treatment of division is found in his handbook\nOn Division (De divisione). His treatment of the\nTopics is found in his handbook On the Topical Differences\n(De differentiis topicis) and in his commentary on\nCicero\u2019s treatment of the Topics (In Ciceronis\nTopica).\n1.1 Division\n\nThe methods of \u201cdivision\u201d (Greek: diairesis,\nLatin: divisio) and \u201ccollection\u201d (Greek:\nsunagoge, Latin: collectio) have their roots in\nPlato\u2019s later dialogues, and they are common in Ancient\nNeoplatonic and Aristotelian treatises on logic. Plato tells us that\ncollection and division provide us with a way to understand the\nrelationships between some unity and some plurality (Phaedrus\n265d\u2013266b, and Philebus 16c\u201317a). Division is a process\nwhereby any sort of unity is resolved into a plurality. Collection is\nthe process whereby a plurality is collected into a unity.\n\nFor the Neoplatonists, division and collection are first and foremost\napplied to genera and species (such as Animal and Human), and\ninstances of these universals (such as Brownie the donkey and\nSocrates). This primary mode of division is often interpreted as a\nlogical exercise. In particular, it is a method for developing\ndefinitions of things, which can then be used in demonstrations.\nCollection is construed as a method for classification.\n\nThe primary purpose of division for Late Ancient philosophers is to\ndetermine the hierarchical relations between a universal and that\nwhich falls under it. But divisions are applied to a variety of other\nitems. There is no single, canonical list of divisions (for an\noverview, see Magee 1998, xxxvii\u2013xlix). The list presented by\nBoethius is the one bequeathed to the Latin West (On Division\n877c\u2013d).  Boethius distinguishes between two broad categories:\nsubstantial divisions and accidental divisions. These divisions are\ndivided further. Of the substantial divisions there are:\n\nThe division of the genus into its species.\nThe division of the whole into parts.\nThe division of a word into its meanings.\n\n\nOf the accidental divisions there are:\n\nThe division of a subject into accidents.\nThe division of accidents into subjects.\nThe division of accidents into accidents.\n\n\nThe most important material for our purposes is Boethius\u2019\ntreatment of the first and second substantial modes of division.\n1.2 The Topics\n\n\u201cTopic\u201d is the standard translation for the Latin term\nlocus. (Note that the translators of Peter of Spain (2014)\nhave chosen to render it as \u201cplace\u201d, which is the basic\nmeaning of the Latin term.) As Stump (1978, Part 2, and 1982) and\nGreen-Pedersen (1984) have pointed out, the notion of the Topic\nevolves over the course of its use in ancient and medieval logic, but\nroughly put, medieval logicians think that the study of the Topics\nhelps one to discover a number of self-evidently true propositions, or\n\u201cmaximal propositions\u201d, that can serve as warrants for\narguments. (See Peter of Spain, Tractatus V.3\u20134 (2014,\n198\u2013205).) For example, suppose that someone makes this\ninference:\n\nIf Socrates is human, Socrates is animal.\n\n\nStudents of the Topics claim that this inference is warranted by the\nfollowing maximal proposition:\n\nIf a species is predicated of something, that species\u2019 genus is\nalso predicable of that thing.\n\n\nThe student of medieval mereology will be extremely interested in the\nmaximal propositions presented in treatments of the Topic from the\nwhole and the Topic from the part.\n\nFollowing a well-established Ancient tradition, the Topic from the\nwhole is usually divided into two sub-Topics:\n\nThe Topic from the universal whole.\nThe Topic from the integral whole.\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the best medieval philosophers are aware of the\nsubtleties of ordinary language. In particular, they are mindful of\nthe distributive function of the adjectival term \u201cwhole\u201d\n(totus/tota/totum). That is, the term\n\u201ctotus\u201d can act like a universal quantifier and,\nhence, the phrase \u201ctotus x\u201d can mean\n\u201call the parts of x taken together\u201d or \u201cthe\nentire x\u201d (see\n Section 2\n below). This sensitivity to the distributive sense of\n\u201ctotus\u201d might be what motivates medieval\nlogicians to add further refinements to the theory of the Topics.\nSpecifically, the Topic from the whole is routinely divided in a\nsix-fold manner (see, e.g., Peter of Spain Tractatus\nV.11\u201318 (2014, 210\u201319); following Boethius\u2019 terse\nremarks in De topicis differentiis II, 1189A\u2013C; trans.\nStump 1978, 52\u201353). In addition to the Topic from the universal\nwhole and the Topic from the integral whole, there are these\nadditional Topics:\n\nThe Topic from the whole in quantity.\nThe Topic from the whole in a respect (in modo).\nThe Topic from the whole in place.\nThe Topic from the whole in time.\n\n\nThe Topic from the whole in quantity classifies and considers\npropositions where the term is taken universally, such as \u201cEvery\nx is a y\u201d, or \u201cNo x is a\ny\u201d. The Topic from the whole in a respect considers a\nterm in respect to some limiting qualification. So, for example, if\nx is white on its surface, then every part of\nx\u2019s surface is white. The Topic from the whole\nin place classifies propositions bounded by the term\n\u201ceverywhere\u201d or its cognates. So, if water is\neverywhere, then water is here (where\n\u201chere\u201d designates a \u201cpart in place\u201d). And,\nfinally, the Topic from the whole in time considers inferences that\none can make from propositions bounded by the term\n\u201calways\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d.\n\nA full account of medieval mereology would consider carefully the\ndetails of all six sub-Topics. But of special interest to us are the\ntreatments of the Topic from the integral whole and of the Topic from\nthe integral part. In these discussions, medieval philosophers often\nconsider whether the traditional maximal propositions associated with\nthese Topics in fact describe the logical and metaphysical relations\nthat hold between an integral whole and an integral part.\nSpecifically, the maximal proposition that applies to integral wholes\nis:\n\nIf the whole is, then the part is.\n\n\nThe maximal proposition said to apply to the integral part in relation\nto its whole is:\n\nIf the part is not, the whole is not.\n\n\nThese maximal propositions are quite startling. They seem to entail,\nfor example, that if Socrates exists, then his hand must exist, and if\nSocrates\u2019 hand ceases to exist, then Socrates ceases to exist.\nAs we will see in\n Section 4.2,\n such consequences do not escape the notice of medieval philosophers,\nand much of interest regarding the metaphysical implications of the\nTopics and their maximal propositions ensues.\n2. Wholes\n\nSometimes the phrase \u201ctotus x (est)\u201d can mean\n\u201cx is whole\u201d, in the sense that x is\ncomplete or not lacking anything. This is a sense of\n\u201cwhole\u201d that Aristotle identifies in his\nMetaphysics and that he contrasts with the notion of being\n\u201cmutilated\u201d (kolobon) (Metaphysics 5.26\nand 5.27, respectively).\n\nClosely related to the sense of being complete, \u201cwhole\u201d\ncan have a distributive function and the phrase \u201ctotus x est\ny\u201d (\u201cwhole x is y\u201d) can mean\nall of x is y\u2014that is, all the parts of\nx taken together is y. This is called the\nterm\u2019s \u201ccategorematic\u201d sense. Medieval logicians\nalso distinguish a second distributive sense of \u201cwhole\u201d,\nwhich they call the \u201csyncategorematic\u201d sense of the term\n(see, e.g., William of Sherwood Syncategoremata [1941, 54];\nOckham Summa Logicae II, ch. 6 [Opera Philosophica\nI, 267\u201369]; John Buridan Summulae de Dialectica\n4.3.7\u20131; Albert of Saxony Sophismata 45). When\n\u201ctotus x est y\u201d is interpreted\nsyncategorematically, it means each and every part (quaelibet\npars) of x is\n y.[1]\n\nFinally, \u201cwhole\u201d can signify a thing that is either\ncomposed of some things or divisible into some things. This usually is\nthe sense of \u201cwhole\u201d at work in discussions of collection\nand division.\n\nThe ancient practice of collection and division, and especially the\nproclivity to call both the products of collection and the things to\nbe divided wholes, has a lasting influence on medieval mereology. For\nmedieval philosophers a variety of items can be wholes. Universals,\nconcepts, material objects, masses (such as water or gold), souls, and\ntime can all be wholes\u2014and this is only to mention some of the\nmore common items studied by medieval philosophers. Thus, in general,\nanything that is composed out of other items or that can be divided\ninto other items is a whole. But there are two important\nqualifications.\n\nFirst, one should not assume that all wholes are mind-independent\nfeatures of the world. Peter Abelard, for instance, argues that\ntemporal wholes (such as days, weeks, or hours) and universal wholes\nare not things (res). Yet, provided that we do not reify\nthese items, Abelard will allow us to treat items like days and hours\nas wholes consisting of parts, and he will allow us to talk about\nuniversals and their parts. (On temporal wholes, see\nDialectica 554.14\u201323 and Logica Ingredientibus\n2, 187.9\u201314. On universals, see Logica Ingredientibus\n1, 10.8\u201316.18 and Logica Nostrorum 515.10\u2013522.9.\nFor a helpful overview of Abelard\u2019s anti-realist metaphysics,\nconsult King 2004.)\n\nSecond, some medieval philosophers, again motivated by their\nmetaphysical commitments as well as their understanding of what wholes\nmust be, will prefer to distinguish between \u201ctrue\u201d, or\n\u201cproper\u201d, wholes and quasi-wholes. Ockham, for example,\ninsists that individuals are not actually parts of species and species\nare not actually parts of genera. These items are merely\n\u201cparts\u201d, and accordingly their corresponding species and\ngenera are only \u201cwholes\u201d, in a figurative sense. Once this\nfact is appreciated, however, Ockham is willing to allow us to speak\nof a genus or a species as a \u201cwhole of a sort\u201d\n(quoddam totum), since there is a legitimate sense in which a\nspecies \u201ccontains\u201d individuals and a genus\n\u201ccontains\u201d its species (Ockham Expositio in librum\nPorphyrii de praedicabilibus ch. 2, [Opera Philosophica\nII, 54]).\n\nWith these caveats in place, we can begin to explore the basic\nmereological categories that one finds in medieval treatments of\nmereology. As was noted, all manner of items can be wholes, but\ngenerally speaking medieval philosophers believe that this motley\ngroup can be organized under three broad categories: integral wholes,\nuniversal wholes, and potential wholes. It will soon become apparent\nthat the category of integral wholes is quite broad. Indeed, it is so\ninclusive that some philosophers will feel pressure to introduce a\nfourth basic category, substantial wholes. But others will suggest\nthat an integral whole is divisible into two distinct kinds of parts,\nquantitative parts and substantial parts. For this reason, I will\nconsider the issue of substantial wholes and substantial parts in\n Section 3.1.\n2.1 Integral wholes\n\nMuch of what we encounter in the material world is, or can be\nconsidered to be, a whole. Cars, houses, plants, and human beings are\ncomposed out of bits of metal, plastic, cellulose, or flesh and bone.\nThese items are not only divisible into the components just mentioned;\nthey are divisible into other parts such as carburetors, doors,\nleaves, and hands.\n\nMedieval philosophers consider the wholes mentioned above to be either\n\u201ccontinuous\u201d or \u201ccontiguous\u201d integral wholes,\nwhere a contiguous whole is a type of \u201cdiscrete\u201d whole.\nContinuous wholes are wholes whose parts share a common boundary.\nDiscrete wholes are wholes whose parts do not share a common boundary.\nThe parts of discrete integral wholes can be either close to one\nanother, or relatively scattered. Contiguous wholes consist of parts\nthat are discrete, but spatially close together. Discrete wholes whose\nparts are relatively diffuse are \u201cdisaggregated\u201d integral\nwholes. (For a fairly comprehensive catalog of the kinds of integral\nwholes, see Anonymous Compendium Logicae Porretanum\nIII.12.)\n\nWhether an item is a continuous or contiguous whole will depend upon\nother metaphysical commitments. Some early medieval philosophers only\nhave simple artifacts like fences and walls in mind when they talk\nabout contiguous wholes. But others think that even more complicated\nman-made objects, such as wagons, houses, and clocks are contiguous,\nand not continuous wholes, because only substances are continuous\nwholes. Abelard and Aquinas both hold the latter position, and thus,\nthat only individual donkeys, palm trees, human beings, and the like,\nare continuous wholes. Abelard thinks that this is true because only\nGod can fuse parts together into a continuous unity. Human\nmanipulations, no matter how skilled, are only capable of placing\nparts in close proximity to one another (Dialectica\n417.4\u201337; 419.35\u2013420.6). Drawing upon Aristotle\u2019s\nreflections on form and matter (especially in his De Anima,\nPhysics and Metaphysics), Aquinas thinks that only\nsubstances possess the kind of form that can inhere in each and every\npart of the whole and thereby make it truly one (Summa\nTheologiae I, q. 76, art. 8; Quaestiones de Anima q. 10;\nsee also Pasnau 2002, 79\u201388). An artifact possesses a form that\nmerely orders and arranges the parts of the whole. We can tell whether\na form imbues its parts in the manner required of a substantial form\nby attending to the effect of the form\u2019s existence on the\nfunctionality of the parts. The human soul inheres in the hands of a\nhuman being as a substantial form because if the soul were removed,\nthat part would cease to function as a hand \u2013 indeed, Aquinas\ninsists that this thing would cease to be a hand. By contrast, when\nthe form of a car is removed from the items that make up the car, many\nof these items can still be car-parts. For example, a carburetor can\nstill be a carburetor; it can be placed in another car and continue\nfunctioning as a\n carburetor.[2]\n\nIn addition to artifacts, plants, and animals, some medieval\nphilosophers expand the class of continuous integral wholes to cover\nhomogeneous masses, such as some gold or some water, and the class of\ndisaggregated integral wholes to include scattered mereological sums,\nsuch as the sum of this mountain and this dog. However, one will not\nfind any medieval philosopher who assents to the modern mereological\nthesis of universalism, or what David Lewis calls \u201cunrestricted\nfusion\u201d (1991, 74; cf. Simons 1987, 108\u201312 and the\nsubsection on unrestricted fusions in the Encyclopedia entry on\n mereology).\n Peter Abelard comes close when he asserts that any two items, even\nones belonging to different categories of being, can constitute a\nplurality (Dialectica 548.19\u201322; see also the anonymous\ntwelfth-century Introductiones Montanae maiores, 69rb, where\nAbelard\u2019s thesis is mocked). But one suspects that even Abelard,\nif pressed, might step back from assenting to a full-blown version of\nuniversalism for theological reasons. For in discussions of\nGod\u2019s simplicity, it is routinely noted that God is not\nintrinsically composite and that He cannot be combined with\nanything else and that nothing can be combined with Him (see,\ne.g., Aquinas Summa Theologiae I, q. 3, arts. 7\u20138).\nThis strong thesis about the lack of composition in God is maintained\nbecause being a part of something implies a certain sort of\npotentiality and incompleteness. If anything could be a part of a\nwhole that also has God as a part, then there is something that God\ncould be\u2013namely, a part of this composite\u2013that He\ncurrently is not. And even if He currently is a part of the sum of all\nthings (for instance), given that some of the other parts are\ncontingent beings, the sum of all things is contingent. Accordingly,\nGod\u2019s parthood is contingent, or has a potentiality. But God is\nfully actual and necessary. Hence, God cannot be a part of some\ngreater\n composite.[3]\n\nAs a more general point, it must be remembered that medieval\nphilosophers are for the most part working within an Aristotelian\nframework, and like Aristotle, their paradigmatic examples of unified\ncomposite things are substances. If a thing is not unified by a\nsubstantial form, then that thing has a lesser kind of unity. Humans\nand dogs are more unified than houses and wagons. Houses and wagons,\nnonetheless, are unified by a form\u2014 namely, an accidental\nform\u2014and so they have a unity of a sort. Moreover, this kind\nunity will be greater than the unity of a mere collection of things.\nHence, as a general rule, the more gerrymandered a collection of parts\nis, the more likely it is that this composite\u2019s status as a\nwhole will be called into question (see, e.g., Aquinas In\nMetaphysica expositio, Book V, lectio XXI \u00a7\u00a7\n1102\u20134; Jean Buridan Summulae de Dialectica 8.1.4).\n\nIn addition to material beings, some medieval philosophers allow\nnon-material items to be integral wholes. For example, Ockham thinks\nthat complex mental acts can be wholes, and Aquinas insists that\nactions such as penance are integral wholes (Ockham Quaestiones in\nphysicam q. 6 [Opera VI, 407\u201310]; In De\nInt. I, prooemium, 6 [Opera II, 354\u20138]; Aquinas\nSumma Theologiae III, q. 90, art. 3). Abelard insists that\ntemporal items are not integral wholes, but he seems to be in the\nminority. Non-material integral wholes do not sit easily under either\nthe continuous or the discrete category, since their parts cannot be\nrelated to one another with respect to location. If asked to pick,\nmedieval philosophers tend to label temporal wholes and events as\ncontinuous wholes, but they are not continuous in the way that a\nbronze rod is continuous. Their parts to not share some spatial\nboundary; they come one after another in continuous succession. For\nthis reason, these wholes are sometimes called\n\u201csuccessive\u201d wholes (Anonymous Compendium Logiae\nPorretanum III.12). In addition to aggregates of time, processes\n(that is, things that take time to unfold) are also sometimes\nconsidered to be successive wholes (see, e.g., Aquinas Summa\nTheologiae III, q. 90, art. 3, ad 3).\n\nIn short, an astounding variety of items can be integral wholes. Yet,\nno matter how large this category becomes, most medieval philosophers\ninsist that the class of integral wholes does not exhaust the domain\nof items that can be wholes. In particular, there are two types of\nitem that require their own category: universals and the so-called\n\u201cpotential wholes\u201d.\n2.2 Universal wholes\n\nMany non-material items are considered to be integral wholes. But most\nmedieval philosophers mark off one special sort of non-material\nobject, the universal, and treat it as a separate type of whole.\n\nIt was noted in\n Section 1.1\n that universals, and especially species and their genera, are related\nto one another hierarchically. For instance, the species Human Being\nand the species Horse both fall under the genus Animal. Additionally,\nindividuals are related hierarchically to their species and genera.\nHence, Socrates and Cicero fall under the species Human Being and the\ngenus Animal. These relations between universals and individuals are\noften described in the terms of collection and division. Cicero and\nSocrates and all other humans are collected into the species Human\nBeing, and the species Human Being and Horse and all other species are\ncollected in the genus Animal. Correlatively, Animal is divided into\nits species, and Human Being is divided into individual humans.\n\nThis language of collection and division invites medieval philosophers\nto call the divisible items wholes, and the products of these\ndivisions parts, but most medieval philosophers are not tempted to\nthink that universals are literally composed out of\nindividuals or lesser species. There are noteworthy exceptions. For\nexample, an anonymous twelfth-century philosopher carefully\narticulates and spiritedly defends a version of what is often called\nthe collection (collectio) theory of universals\n(Pseudo-Joscelin De generibus et speciebus \u00a7\u00a7\n84\u2013153 (2014, 158\u201385)). But, in general, universal wholes\nare clearly marked off from other kinds of whole, and their behavior\nis thought to be distinct from the behavior of potential and integral\nwholes.\n\nThere is one significant complication. In his On Division,\nBoethius distinguishes between the division of a genus and the\ndivision of a whole (877c\u2013d, see also In Cic. top.\n331.18\u201319). But then under his treatment of the ways to divide\nwholes, he notes that one way to divide a true whole is to divide a\nuniversal into its subordinate individuals (887d). That a universal\ncan be a true whole will matter below when we try to uncover the\nproperties that differentiate one kind of part-whole relation from\nothers (Section\n 3.3).\n2.3 Potential wholes\n\nIn addition to integral wholes and universal wholes, Boethius\nintroduces a third basic type of whole to medieval philosophers: the\nwhole consisting of \u201cpowers\u201d (potentiae) or\n\u201cvirtues\u201d (virtutes) (On Division 888a).\nThese wholes are often called \u201cvirtual wholes\u201d or\n\u201cpotential wholes\u201d. This article will follow that\npractice, but it should be understood that in medieval contexts\n\u201cpotential\u201d usually signifies something that is in some\nrespect not fully actualized, and, hence, in some contexts\n\u201cpotential whole\u201d and \u201cpotential part\u201d refer\nto things that are possibly, but not actually divided, as when a\ncontinuum with a certain magnitude is potentially divisible but not\nactually divided into halves or fourths, or when a substance is said\nto be potentially divisible into its elemental constituents (see\nPasnau 2011, 606\u2013629). This standard sense of\n\u201cpotency\u201d is even at work in the potential wholes that\nBoethius is talking about, since the soul\u2019s powers are typically\nrelated to the soul\u2019s \u201coperations\u201d, or activities,\nand these activities are clearly not always occurring. A soul might\nhave the power to see or the power to think, even though it is not\npresently seeing or thinking. Nonetheless, these Boethian potential\nwholes are actual and actually possess these potential parts; they are\nnot \u201cpotential\u201d in the sense that they are possible things\nor things that are merely capable of being divided.\n\nPotential wholes are curious items. They are particulars, not\nuniversals. Yet potential wholes are not composed out of their parts\nin the way that, for example, a house is composed out of bricks and\nwood. Indeed, the most commonly discussed kind of potential whole is a\nsoul. But for Aristotelians souls are forms and it is generally held\nthat forms are mereologically simple. Thus, souls ought to be\nmereologically simple. That Boethius, or for that matter, Aristotle\nasserts that souls have parts is therefore initially quite puzzling.\n(For a list of the places where Aristotle talks about the parts of the\nsoul as well as a defense of the claim that we should take\nAristotle\u2019s use of the term \u201cparts\u201d seriously, see\nJohansen 2014.)\n\nFurther reflection, however, shows us that a soul (and especially a\nhuman soul) is a complicated thing. It has a variety of capacities,\nwhich seem to be really distinct from one another and possibly from\nthe soul itself. Some of these capacities even seem to be contrary to\none another. For example, a soul seems to be capable of psychic\nconflict. There is a lot of pressure then put on this putatively\nsimple, yet obviously complicated thing, and therefore it is hardly\nsurprising that there is a robust medieval debate over the nature of\nthe parts or powers of the soul (see Perler 2015). Some think that the\npressure is too great to sustain and that one substantially simple\nthing cannot be the subject of all these capacities. Two common\nreasons are given for the soul\u2019s being really divided in a\nsubstantial manner. First, it seems that really distinct operations\nmust stem from really distinct sources, and since operations are\naccidents of substances, this would seem to imply that the operations\nof a soul must stem from distinct substantial sources. Second,\naccording to Aristotle, the rational capacities do not require a\nbodily instrument to operate, where the other capacities do. This\nleads some medieval Aristotelians to conclude that whereas the\nnon-rational capacities arise from the matter of the thing, the\nrational capacities must come from some external source. This, in\nturn, suggests that a human being has at least one substantial form\nthat is rooted in and arises from the matter, and another substantial\nform that comes from an external source. If all of this is right, then\nhumans at least either have several souls, or one substantially\ncomposite soul, where the parts are viewed as\n\u201cincomplete\u201d substances that combine to form one\n\u201cperfected\u201d soul (see Pasnau 1997; Perler 2014). Others,\nand most famously Aquinas and his followers, hold that a living thing\ncan only have one substantial form and therefore only one soul (Pasnau\n2002, 126\u201330). These \u201cunitarians\u201d must come up with\nan answer to how the powers do not in fact divide the soul into souls,\nespecially those unitarians like Aquinas who hold that the powers of\nthe soul are really distinct from the soul itself. (In fact, according\nto King (2008), the dominant view in the medieval period is that the\nsoul\u2019s powers are really distinct from the soul\u2019s\nsubstance.) A commonly proposed solution is that the powers\n\u201cflow out\u201d from the soul\u2019s essence and that the\nsubordinate powers of the soul are \u201cvirtually present\u201d in\nthe soul (see Shields 2014 for an analysis of Su\u00e1rez\u2019s\nversion of this solution; also Perler 2015).\n\nIn keeping with the introductory nature of his treatise, Boethius\nremains silent about many of these issues and instead focuses on the\nlogical nature of the soul considered as a whole consisting of powers.\nUnfortunately, what he says actually makes matters all the more\nobscure since he notes that the division of a potential whole\nresembles both the division of a genus and the division of a\nwhole:\n\nFor in that each and every part of it entails the predicate\n\u201csoul\u201d it is brought into connection with the division of\nthe genus, each and every species of which necessarily entails the\ngenus itself. On the other hand, in that not every soul is composed of\nall parts but each one is composed differently, in this it is\nnecessarily brought into connection with the nature of a whole.\n(On Division 888c\u2013d [trans. Magee 1998, 41])\n\n\nSome earlier medieval philosophers take Boethius\u2019 statement as\nan invitation to reduce the soul, and the potential whole in general,\nto either a genus or an integral whole. (One of the first attempts to\nplace the division of soul under the division of the genus is found in\na short letter from a mysterious ninth-century thinker identified only\nas \u201cMaster L\u201d. The letter is preserved in the manuscripts\nof St. Gall, and is transcribed by De Rijk (1963, 75\u201378).)\nHowever, the attempt to reduce soul to either a genus or an integral\nwhole appears doomed, for potential wholes do not fit well under\neither category. Souls are particular, and hence, they cannot be\nuniversals of any kind, let alone genera. On the other hand, by\nintroducing the potential whole as an additional kind of\nwhole, Boethius appears to be signalling that potential wholes do not\nhave parts in the same way that other true wholes have parts: Socrates\ncan be separated into his hands, feet, and so forth; a chemical\nmixture can be reduced back into its ingredients. Even a universal\nwhole can be separated into independently existing parts, namely, the\nindividuals that are its parts. But a soul is neither constructed out\nof its powers, nor does it appear to be separable into freestanding\nparts: the powers must be powers of a soul.\n\nWe begin to see some progress in the twelfth century. For example, in\na treatise that has been attributed to the young Peter Abelard we\nlearn that there are two definitions of soul, a \u201csuperior\u201d\none in virtue of which the soul \u201chas an affinity with a\nuniversal whole\u201d, and an \u201cinferior\u201d definition in\nvirtue of which soul has an affinity with an integral whole:\n\nThis is the superior definition of \u201csoul\u201d: soul is a\nquality with respect to which a body is made to be alive. It is in\naccord with this definition that \u201csoul\u201d is predicated of\nits parts individually, and thus the power of knowing is a quality\nwith respect to which a body is made to be alive, and the power of\nsensing is a quality with respect to which a body is made to be alive.\nThis is the inferior definition of \u201csoul\u201d: soul is a\nquality constituted out of rationality, out of sensibility, and out of\nvegetability (vegetabilitate). And it is with respect to this\ndefinition that [soul] cannot be predicated of its parts taken\nsingularly, since one cannot say that the power of thinking is that\nwhich is constituted out of rationality, sensibility, and\nvegetability. ((ps?) Abelard, De divisionibus\n194.12\u201322)\n\n\nThis solution helps to explain the strange predicative behavior of\nsoul and its powers. It also, interestingly, provides us with a\nsolution to what a potential part is: The soul turns out to be a\nquality composed in a fairly familiar sense of\n\u201ccomposition\u201d out of other qualities. The commentator thus\nattempts to explain the tricky notion of potential-parthood in terms\nof more understandable relations, namely, the predication relation and\nthe relation of an integral part to its whole.\n\nIn his commentary on Boethius\u2019s text, Albert the Great takes a\ndifferent approach (In de Div. tract. 4, ch. 1; Loe ed.,\n75\u20139). He refers to the view that a potential whole is some sort\nof intermediary between a universal and an integral whole, but then he\nproceeds to give a different explanation why a potential whole is a\nwhole: It is a whole because the full and complete list of the\ncapacities will produce the full and complete account of the soul in\nso far as it is the principle of life and self-motion. But it does not\nfollow from this that any given particular soul will have all of the\npowers and capacities on the list. Albert also hastens to add that\nwhile a full list of the capacities of soul gives us the substance of\nthe principle of life and motion, under this description we are not\nattending to a substance in the absolute sense. We, thus, should not\nconclude that a soul is divisible in the way that an integral whole is\ndivisible. That is, these capacities need not answer to little\nsubstances or parts of substances that constitute the soul. To help us\nto see his point, Albert offers an example of another potential\nwhole:\n\nAnd again a regime (regnum) is a whole of this kind, given\nthat it consists of its powers, namely, the king, the prefect, the\nsuperintendent, and others of this sort. (In de Div. tract.\n4, ch. 1; Loe ed., 75)\n\n\nAlbert is thinking of the regime in terms of an act or role, which is\nanalyzable and hence consists in smaller roles and their associated\npowers. The complete list of the roles in regimes would give the whole\nof what it is to be a regime. But like individual souls, a particular\nregime will require some of these roles and their attendant powers,\nbut it need not possess all of them. Moreover, a difference in role\ndoes not imply a difference in subject. The same person could perform\nsome or even all of these distinct roles.\n3. Parts\n\nMany kinds of item can be wholes, and many kinds of item can be parts\nof these wholes. In general, any item that composes a whole is a part,\nand any item that is a product of a division of some whole is a part\nof that whole. The only clear restriction on what can be a part is\nthat no part is identical to its whole. In other words, no medieval\nphilosopher countenances what contemporary mereologists call improper\nparts. (On the contemporary notions of part, or improper\npart, and proper part consult the entry on contemporary\n mereology,\n and also Simons 1987, 9\u201311.)\n\nWe will first consider the kinds of things that can be parts of\nintegral wholes\n (Section 3.1).\n We will then turn to the parts of universals\n (Section 3.2).\n As it will turn out, some of the things that can be parts of\nuniversals can also be parts of integral wholes. This will prompt us\nto consider several criteria that medieval philosophers use to\ndistinguish universal wholes from integral wholes\n (Section 3.3).\n Finally, we will return to consider potential wholes in light of\nthese criteria for distinguishing universals from integral wholes\n (Section 3.4).\n3.1 Parts of integral wholes\n\nConsider the paradigmatic integral whole Socrates. Socrates is\ncomposed out of a soul and a body. His body is composed out of flesh,\nbone, and blood. And the flesh, bone, and blood in turn are ultimately\ncreated by combining the four basic elements, Earth, Air, Fire, and\nWater. All these components of Socrates can be considered integral\nparts of Socrates.\n\nSocrates is divisible into a number of other parts. We can cut\nSocrates in half, and thereby create the top half of Socrates and the\nbottom half of Socrates. We can also divide Socrates into his hands,\nfeet, torso, heart, and so forth. All these products of the divisions\nof Socrates can be considered integral parts of Socrates as well.\n\nMedieval philosophers separate this plethora of integral parts into a\nnumber of distinct categories. The top and bottom halves of Socrates\nare often called quantitative parts, since they divide Socrates solely\nwith respect to a quantity, or measure. Flesh, bone, and blood, as\nwell as the elements that compose these components also are often\ncalled quantitative parts, for they comprise Socrates\u2019 matter,\nand matter is often associated with quantity.\n\nNot all medieval philosophers think that the elements are parts of\nSocrates. Abelard, for example, believes that the elements are\ningredients, but not every ingredient is a part. Strictly speaking,\nonly those items that compose some whole and remain in that whole\nafter composition are parts of the whole (Dialectica\n575.18\u201336). Hence, even though the flour is an ingredient of the\nbread, the flour is not a part of the bread. The flour has been\naltered by a chemical change, and so it does not remain once the bread\nis baked. Likewise, while the elements combine into a chemical mixture\nthat becomes flesh, the earth and water that make up flesh are no\nlonger present. Only the crumbs and flesh are properly parts of the\nbread and Socrates respectively.\n\nMany later medieval thinkers effectively agree with Abelard on this\npoint. The elements that compose my body only exist in actuality when\nmy body has been dissolved back into elemental matter (see Ward 2014,\n125\u201344). While I am alive, these elements only exist\n\u201cvirtually\u201d or \u201cpotentially\u201d in me. Some\nmedieval philosophers went so far as to suggest that most or even all\nthe parts of a substance exist only in potency when the substance is\nactual (see Pasnau 2011, 606\u201329).\n\nMedieval philosophers also like to draw a distinction between the\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous parts of Socrates\u2019 body.\nHeterogeneous parts are such that, if they are themselves divided,\ntheir constituents are not of the same type as the original. For\nexample, a hand is composed out of fingers, knuckles, and a palm. It\nis also, from another viewpoint, composed out of muscles, skin, and\nsinews. No part of the hand is a hand. However, some of the\nhand\u2019s parts are homogeneous. Muscle, skin, and blood are each\nhomogeneous, since every bit of muscle is muscle, every bit of blood\nis itself blood, and every bit of skin is also skin.\n\nThe distinction between heterogeneous and homogeneous parts is\nbequeathed to medieval philosophers by Aristotle and Boethius.\nAristotle imposes a loose hierarchy on these types of parts, claiming\nthat the heterogeneous parts are composed out of homogeneous parts\n(History of Animals 486a13\u201314). This in turn suggests\nthat the division of a whole into its parts is best initiated by\ndividing it into its heterogeneous parts, and only then into its\nhomogeneous parts. Boethius is less explicit, suggesting that there\nmay be many equally acceptable ways to begin to divide up a thing into\nits parts (On Division 888a\u2013b).\n\nMany of the heterogeneous parts of Socrates are best defined in terms\nof their function, not their measure. For example, hands are\ndiscriminated from feet based on what functions they perform for an\nanimal. Many medieval philosophers believe that these functions are\nprovided either by the form or the soul of the animal. For this\nreason, many medieval philosophers call functionally defined parts\n\u201cformal parts\u201d, or parts secundum formam, but in\norder to avoid any confusion, I will refer to parts of this sort as\nfunctional parts. The fourteenth-century philosopher Walter\nBurley tells us that the functional parts \u201cremain the same so\nlong as the whole remains the same and complete\u201d (De toto et\nparte, 301). In other words, so long as Socrates\u2019 soul\noccupies his body, and provided the hand is not cut off,\nSocrates\u2019 hand remains a hand. Burley contrasts functional parts\nwith material parts, and he places homogeneous parts such as flesh,\nbone, and blood under this category. Socrates\u2019 material parts\nare in constant flux; Socrates is constantly losing and replacing bits\nof flesh and blood.\n\nIn addition to the functional parts, Socrates\u2019 substantial form\n(or forms) and his matter (either his prime matter or his proximate\nmatter en masse) can be considered parts of Socrates. But\nhere there is some question as to whether form and matter are\nintegral parts of Socrates. What Boethius says is\nambiguous.\n\nThere is also a division of the whole into matter and form. For in one\nmanner the statue is constructed out of its parts, and in another\nmanner out of matter and form\u2014i.e. out of bronze and its shape\n(species). (On Division 888b [Magee 1998, 40])\n\n\nIt is striking to learn that the form and the matter of the statue are\nnot \u201cparts\u201d, especially since they are products of a\ndivision. Moreover, if a core meaning of \u201cpart of\nx\u201d is \u201cthat out of which x comes to\nbe\u201d (cf. Boethius\u2019 On the Trinity 2), then the\nform and the matter of a thing ought to be the primary parts of that\nthing. Bronze without its form is merely bronze, not a statue;\nSocrates\u2019 matter without Socrates\u2019 substantial form is not\na human. Clearly, then, Boethius cannot mean that form and matter are\nnot parts in any sense.\n\nThe task, then, is to determine what kind of parts form and matter\nare, and especially what kind of parts substantial form and matter\nare. Aquinas routinely distinguishes between the\n\u201cquantitative\u201d parts of a thing and the form and the\nmatter, which he calls \u201cparts of the essence\u201d (Summa\nTheologiae I, q. 8, a. 2, ad 3; I, q. 76, art. 8; III, q. 90, a.\n2). However, he does not provide a clear answer to the question\nwhether the part of an essence is a type of integral part, or whether\nit is a distinct kind of part. Other philosophers present a less\nambiguous line: only parts that make up some quantity can be integral\nparts (see, e.g., Lambert of Auxerre Logica 126; Peter of\nSpain Tractatus V.14 (2014, 212\u20134); Albert of Saxony\nSophismata 45). Accordingly, many medieval thinkers will\npropose that in addition to potential, subjective, and integral parts,\nthere is a fourth kind of part, which I will call a\nsubstantial\n part.[4]\n\nThere are other good reasons why medieval philosophers might be\nmotivated to distinguish the integral parts of a thing from the\nsubstantial parts of the same thing. Firstly, the form does not behave\nlike the integral parts of the thing, since for many Aristotelians\n(and especially, as we saw above, for Aquinas and other unitarians)\nthe form has the unique capacity to be present \u201cas a\nwhole\u201d in each material part of the thing. Integral parts, by\ncontrast, are thought to be unable to be present in more than one\nplace at the same time, and for this reason, the integral parts of a\nthing are said to sit side-by-side, or \u201cpart outside of\npart\u201d (pars extra partem). Secondly, substantial parts\nrequire something else to perfect them (see Albert of Saxony\nSophismata 49). Matter by itself is incomplete; it is only\npotentially this or that thing. Matter needs a form in order to\nactually be this or that thing. Form, too, is in a sense an incomplete\nsubstance. A dog\u2019s form, for instance, is in need of some matter\nin order to be the form of this dog. But more fundamentally, given the\nAristotelian critique of Platonic forms\u2013specifically, the\ncritique of the notion that a form can exist independently of\nmatter\u2013many medieval thinkers will insist that a form is\nincomplete in the sense that it cannot exist unless it is\npart of a substantial composite. Finally, distinguishing between\nsubstantial parts and integral parts captures an important intuition\nabout substances: Socrates can lose and gain matter without\ncompromising his existence. But if Socrates were to lose either his\nmatter in total or his substantial form, he would cease to exist.\n\nIf one draws a sharp distinction between integral parts and\nsubstantial parts, the next natural thought would be to distinguish\nbetween integral and substantial wholes. The trouble is that in many\ncases the same thing seems to be both an integral whole and a\nsubstantial whole. Socrates, for example, has a quantity, and he is\nsurely divisible into smaller quantities. It seems to follow that\nSocrates is an integral whole. But Socrates is also composed of matter\nand substantial form. So, he is a substantial whole. One could reject\nthe notion that Socrates is an integral whole. But, then, what is it\nthat has Socrates\u2019s size? Socrates\u2019 size is supposed to be\nan accident of Socrates, not of a part of Socrates. It is\nperhaps for this reason that some medieval philosophers try a\ndifferent approach. As we already noted, Walter Burley draws a\ndistinction between material parts and parts secundum formam\n(which we called \u201cfunctional\u201d parts, above). Related to\nthis, Burley also draws a distinction between the whole considered in\nrelation to its matter (secundum materiam) and the whole\nconsidered in relation to its form (secundum formam) (De\ntoto et parte, 301). Socrates considered formally\u2014i.e. as a\nunity of this form with some matter\u2014persists through time and\nchange. Socrates considered materially is constantly in flux. That is,\nSocrates on Monday is not the same whole materially as Socrates on\nFriday, because the sum of material parts belonging to Socrates on\nMonday is not identical to the sum of material parts on Friday. The\ndistinction between the whole considered formally and the whole\nconsidered materially will play a role in some medieval theories of\npersistence, and we will pursue this use of the distinction in short\norder (see\n Section 4.2).\n But, first, we must consider the parts of universals and the special\nproblems that the parts of universals entail.\n3.2 Parts of genera and universal wholes\n\nGenera are divisible into their subordinate species, whereas what\nBoethius calls \u201cuniversal wholes\u201d are divisible into their\nsubordinate individuals. In the medieval tradition that follows\nBoethius, these subordinate items are said to be\n\u201csubjective\u201d parts of the universal whole or the genus,\nsince the part is a subject and the whole is predicable of the part.\nSocrates is a subjective part of Human Being and a subjective part of\nAnimal, and Human Being and Animal are predicable of Socrates. That\nis, Socrates is a human being, and Socrates is an animal. However, to\nbe a true subjective part, not only must the name of the whole be\npredicable of the part, the definition of the whole also must be\npredicable of the part. A statue of Socrates could in some contexts be\ncalled a human. For example, suppose someone points to the statue and\nsays, \u201cThat\u2019s a man.\u201d, and then she points to\nanother statue and says, \u201cAnd that\u2019s a horse.\u201d. This\nperson is saying something intelligible, but the statue of Socrates\ncannot be a subjective part of Human Being, since the statue is not a\nrational mortal animal; in substance it is some marble shaped like a\nhuman with certain features. Socrates, however, is a subjective part\nbecause he is a human being and a rational mortal animal. Likewise,\nthe statue of a horse is not a horse in the proper sense, that is, in\nthe same sense that the Black Stallion and Mr. Ed are horses.\n\nGenera and universal wholes both consist of subjective parts, but they\ndiffer with respect to the items that are their subjective parts. This\nfact might explain why Boethius places universal wholes under the\nbroader class of true wholes. Boethius offers four criteria for\ndistinguishing between genera and true wholes (On Division\n879b\u2013d):\n\nThe genus is divided by means of a qualitative difference, whereas\nthe whole is divided by means of a quantitative difference.\nThe genus is naturally prior to its species, whereas the whole is\nnaturally posterior to its parts.\nThe genus is the matter for its species, whereas the parts are the\nmatter for the whole.\nThe species is always the same thing as its genus, while the part\nis sometimes not the same thing as its whole.\n\n\nSome of these criteria could be interpreted in a manner such that the\nuniversal consisting of individuals falls under the category of true\nwholes. Consider, for example, criterion (a). The genus Animal is\ndivided by considering what sort (qualis) of animal something\nis. Human Being is a rational animal, Horse is an\nirrational animal. In contrast, Human Being is not divided\nwith respect to what sort of human being Socrates is. Socrates and\nCicero are both rational animals. The difference between Socrates and\nCicero is due to the fact that this bit of matter which makes up\nSocrates is different from that bit of matter which makes up Cicero. A\ndifference in matter is typically considered to be a quantitative\ndifference. Hence, the parts of the universal whole Human Being appear\nto be distinguished by quantity rather than quality.\n\nHowever, some of the other criteria do not clearly mark genera off\nfrom universal wholes. Consider, for example, the second criterion.\nBoethius seems to have something like this in mind when he articulates\ndifference (b): the parts of a genus are dependent upon the genus,\nwhereas the whole is dependent upon its parts. In other words, if\nthere are no animals, there can be no dogs or humans. In contrast, the\nhouse depends upon its parts. If you take away the roof and floor, the\nhouse ceases to exist. But universal wholes seem to behave like\ngenera, not houses. If we annihilate individual humans, we do not\neliminate the universal Human Being. Therefore, difference (b) does\nnot cleanly demarcate genera from universal wholes.\n\nThe third and fourth criteria present their own special problems,\nsince it is far from clear how to interpret these differences, let\nalone whether the universal whole behaves like the genus or the true\nwhole.\n\nThus, it is not clear that Boethius\u2019s four criteria adequately\nseparate universals divided into universals from universals divided\ninto individuals. It may be that the better division is that between\nuniversal wholes and integral wholes, not genera and true wholes, and\nindeed many medieval philosophers seem to take this route.\n\nThis strategy, however, only provides some relief from the puzzles\nthat seem to arise from Boethius\u2019 four criteria. As we will see\nin the next section, there is still much more to be done to secure a\nclear and principled distinction between universal wholes and integral\nwholes.\n3.3 Distinguishing universals from integral wholes with respect to their parts\n\nBoethius and the majority of his readers assume that universal wholes\nand integral wholes are irreducibly distinct kinds of whole. But there\nare some questions, many raised by minority parties among those who\nstudied Boethius, about whether a clear, principled distinction\nbetween these two kinds of whole can be maintained.\n\nTo see how these questions can be raised, consider one particular\nintegral whole that Boethius himself seems to countenance, namely, the\nintegral whole consisting of all the human beings on the planet\n(On Division 888c). Granted, this is a very large and diffuse\ndiscrete whole. But if we allow crowds and flocks to be integral\nwholes, there seems to be no principled reason to reject the existence\nof the sum of all humans. (And, again, medieval logicians would have\nhad the authority of Boethius as support.) At the same time each of\nthese human beings is a subjective part of the universal Human Being.\nIf wholes are distinguished by the type of parts that they have, it\nseems that the universal Human Being just is the integral whole\ncomposed of all human beings.\n\nPeter Abelard reports that there were some medieval philosophers who\ndrew this very conclusion. Abelard describes and attacks this\n\u201ccollection theory\u201d of universals in his Logica\nIngredientibus (1, 13.18\u201315.22). For fuller presentations\nand evaluations of Abelard\u2019s critique, one should consult Henry\n(1984, 235\u201359), Freddosso (1978), and Tweedale (1976,\n113\u201315). Here I will give only one objection: Abelard thinks\nthat the collection theory gets the relation of dependence between the\nuniversal and the individuals backwards. According to Abelard, the\ncollection theory is committed to the view that when Socrates dies,\nthe universal Human Being is changed, and if one believes, as Abelard\ndoes, that a discrete integral whole is identical to the sum of its\nparts, then the Human Being that has Socrates as a part is not\nidentical to the Human Being without Socrates. There is a new Human\nBeing. But this, Abelard insists, is contrary to the orthodox\nunderstanding of universals, which states that while the individuals\nthat fall under a universal are impermanent, the universal itself is\npermanent. Indeed, Human Being would exist even if every human being\nwere annihilated.\n\nYet, whatever one ultimately makes of the collection theory and\nAbelard\u2019s counterarguments, this much is clear: the difference\nbetween integral wholes and universal wholes cannot be defined solely\nand simply in terms of the kinds of items that are parts of these\nwholes. Substances can be parts of both. Rather, the distinction\nbetween universal wholes and integral wholes must be maintained in\nterms of more nuanced constraints or properties.\n\nMany medieval philosophers focus on the fact that every part of a\nuniversal whole taken singularly must accept the predication of the\nname and the definition of the whole, whereas this is not true of each\nand every part of an integral whole (Aquinas Summa Theol. III\nq. 90, art. 3; Walter Burley De toto et parte, 302; and\nBuridan Summulae 8.1.4). For example, Socrates and Plato are\nboth parts of the universal whole Human Being, and Human Being is\npredicable of both Socrates and Plato. That is,\n\nSocrates is a human being, and Socrates is a rational, mortal animal.\n\n\nand\n\nPlato is a human being, and Plato is a rational, mortal animal.\n\n\nThis is true of every part of Human Being. In contrast, an\nintegral whole is not predicable of its parts taken singularly. That\nis, one cannot say that\n\nThis piece of wood is a house.\n\n\nIntegral wholes are only predicable of their parts taken all at\nonce.\n\nThis wood and this stone and these other parts taken together are a\nhouse.\n\n\nThis seems to give us a principled way to exclude some items from the\nuniversal whole Human Being and thus to distinguish it from the\nintegral whole consisting of all human beings. For this seems to be\nright: only whole human beings are parts of Human Being. That is,\nSocrates and Cicero are parts of Human Being, but Socrates\u2019\nfinger and Cicero\u2019s head are not parts of Human Being, even\nthough the latter are parts of the integral whole consisting of all\nhuman beings. Socrates and Cicero are parts of Human Being because\nSocrates is a human being and Cicero is a human being. The parts of\nSocrates and Cicero are not parts of Human Being because\nSocrates\u2019 hand is not a human being and Cicero\u2019s head is\nnot a human being; whereas they are part of the integral whole\nconsisting of all the humans, since Transitivity seems to hold for\nintegral parts: if x is a part of y and y\nis a part of z, then x is also a part of z.\n(It should be noted, however, that some medieval authors were\nsuspicious of an unrestricted form Transitivity, even for integral\nwholes. See Arlig 2013 for details.) There is also this: while it is\ntrue that some of the parts of the sum of all human beings will accept\nthe predication of the name and definition of Human Being, if one\nexamines the matter carefully, it turns out that the definition of\nthe sum of all human beings is not the same as the species\nHuman Being, for the sum of all human beings is not itself a rational,\nmortal animal.\n\nThere is a complication that is raised by considering wholes that are\ncomposed of homogeneous parts. Boethius himself illustrates the\nproblem with the example of a bronze rod, which he believes is a\nhomogeneous substance (On Division 879d). Recall that if\nsomething is a homogeneous substance, then every part of that thing is\nalso the same substance. That is, if y is a homogeneous whole\nand x is a part of y, the name and definition of\ny is also predicable of x. Every portion of bronze\ncan take both the name and the definition of bronze, and hence, it\nseems that every part of the bronze rod meets the standard of being a\nsubjective part. Therefore, it seems that the bronze rod is a\nuniversal, which is clearly absurd.\n\nBoethius resolves the puzzle of the rod and its parts by noting that\nwhile it is true that each portion of bronze is bronze, it is not true\nthat a portion of the original quantity of bronze is that original\nquantity of bronze (Boethius On Division 880a)\nBoethius\u2019 solution is often repeated ((ps?) Abelard De\ndivisionibus 169.33\u201336; Albertus Magnus In de Div.\ntract. 2, ch. 5 (Loe ed., 35); and Radulphus Brito In de Top.\nII, q. 9 [1978, 45]; cf. Aquinas Summa Theologiae I, q. 3,\nart. 7).\n\nThe solution points to another difference between integral wholes and\nuniversals. As Abelard puts it, every integral whole \u201cdraws\ntogether\u201d (comprehendere) some quantity\n(Dialectica, 546.21\u201327). The suggestion is that when\nsome items compose an integral whole, that whole will be measurable\nwith respect to some quantity or other. The integral whole that is\nmeasured by some quantity need not be composed out of material\nelements. Consider the mereological sum of the angel Gabriel and the\nangel Michael. If this sum is a whole (and there seems to be no reason\nto deny this), it seems it is an integral whole. However, there are\nsome integral wholes which do not seem to embrace any quantity,\nnamely, thoughts and actions. So there is need to locate yet another\ndifference between universal wholes and integral wholes.\n\nThe last difference that we will consider is this: Universals, like\nHuman Being or Horse, are not literally composed out of their\nspecies. Integral wholes, such as Socrates or a house, are composed\nout of their parts (John Buridan Summulae de Dialectica\n6.4.4; Ockham Expositio in librum Porphyrii 2.16\n[Opera II, 54]). Composites are dependent upon their\ncomponents. Socrates is composed of his body and his soul. If these\ncomponents did not exist and combine to form Socrates, Socrates would\nnot exist. Components are often, but not necessarily, temporally prior\nto the whole that they compose. For example, the house is composed by\nbits of wood, stone, and iron, and these parts existed prior to the\nexistence of the house. Universal wholes are neither dependent upon\ntheir parts, nor are the parts of a universal temporally prior to it.\nThe species existed long before Socrates or Cicero, and will exist\nlong after Socrates and Cicero. Indeed, Human Being can exist, even if\nno individual human being exists.\n\nUnlike the appeal to quantity, the composition criterion can be\napplied to thoughts and actions, for a complex thought requires the\nsimpler concepts that compose it, and penance requires that the\nactions that constitute penance occur.\n\nOn the other hand, it appears that a universal is also a composite.\nEvery universal except for the most general of genera, can be said to\nbe \u201ccomposed\u201d out of a genus and a differentia.\nThese parts are sometimes called \u201cessential\u201d parts of the\nuniversal since the genus and differentia together constitute\nthe essence of the universal (Aquinas Summa Theologiae I, q.\n8, art. 2, ad 3; and I q. 76, art. 8), although to avoid confusion we\nperhaps ought to call them definitional parts. The essence of\na universal is usually encoded in its definition. For example, the\ndefinition of Human Being is rational mortal animal.\nAnimal is the genus, and rationality and mortality are the\ndifferentiae.\n\nMany medieval philosophers try to dampen this criticism by suggesting\nthat the universal is, strictly speaking, not composite; it merely\nmimics composition (again, see Ockham Expositio in librum\nPorphyrii 2.16). Perhaps this is a viable response, but there is\nanother problem with the composition requirement: it does not tell us\nwhy all the parts of integral wholes are integral parts. It was\nalready observed in passing that not all parts of an integral whole\nare plausibly components of their wholes. Consider Socrates. The\nelements are strictly what compose Socrates. It is only when Socrates\nis composed that other parts, such as his hands and feet, come into\nexistence. Or put another way, it is false to say that one makes a\nhuman being by cobbling together hands, feet, and head. Such a\ncreature would be Frankenstein\u2019s monster, not a human being.\n\nIn sum, a number of proposals are offered for how one can distinguish\nuniversal wholes from integral wholes. But perhaps no single proposal\nis universally embraced because of the bewildering variety of items\nthat are integral wholes. An obvious solution would be to reduce the\nnumber of items that can be integral wholes or integral parts. And as\nwe have seen already, some philosophers in fact do this in certain\ncases, as when Abelard eliminates temporal wholes. However, based on\nwhat we presently know, no medieval thinker attempts anything like a\nsystematic eliminative project in mereology as such. (Thus, while\nOckham, for instance, famously undertakes a comprehensive and severe\neliminative project in ontology, he does not attempt to develop a\nsystematic theory of what can and what cannot be a part. Rather, for\nhim, the question whether \u201cpart\u201d is being used either\nproperly or figuratively tends to arise within a specific context and\nthe resolution often appears to be developed on a case by case\nbasis.)\n3.4 Parts of potential wholes\n\nPotential wholes add further complications. Like genera, and unlike\nintegral wholes, it is usually assumed that potential wholes are not\nliterally composed out of their parts. Potential wholes, or at least\nthe subjects underlying them, are items that are fundamentally simple.\nBut, in another respect, the parts of the potential whole behave like\nparts of an integral whole. Different souls can possess only a\nselection of the capacities associated with soul, and so in a sense,\nthere is a construction of a specific soul\u2019s total capacity out\nof many discrete capacities and powers. And no one power by itself\nexhibits or stands in for the whole soul.\n\nThe question thus arises as to how one can distinguish powers as parts\nfrom both subjective and integral parts. Here we will look briefly at\nonly one account. Aquinas separates potential wholes from both\nuniversals and integral wholes by considering two parameters: the\npresence of the whole in the part with respect to the whole\u2019s\nessence, and the presence of the whole in the part with respect to the\nwhole\u2019s power (Summa Theologiae I, q. 77, art. 1, ad\n1). The universal whole \u201cis present to each of its parts in its\nentire essence and power\u201d. It is for this reason that each part\nof the universal is a subjective part. In contrast, the integral whole\nis not in each of its parts either in respect to its entire essence or\nin respect to its power. Hence, the integral whole is not predicable\nof any one of its parts taken singularly. Finally, the potential whole\nis present to each of its parts with respect to its entire essence,\nbut not with respect to its full power. This is why, even though\none\u2019s soul is non-composite and cannot be cut up, the operation\nof thinking does not entail along with it the operation of\nsensing.\n4. Mereology and metaphysics\n\nMedieval philosophers are well aware that the study of wholes and\ntheir parts has numerous applications in metaphysics. I will conclude\nthis survey by examining two applications. First, I will look at how\ntheorizing about parts and wholes informs medieval reflections on\nidentity at a time. Second, I will consider how mereology influences\nmedieval theories of persistence through time and survival through\nchange.\n4.1 Identity\n\nMedieval philosophers think that no part is identical to its\n whole.[5]\n The reasons why this is true are as varied as the types of parts and\nwholes themselves. If x is a quantitative part of y,\nthen x is lesser in quantity than y. A\ndonkey\u2019s form is not identical to the donkey, because this\ndonkey is a composite of the donkey\u2019s form and something\nelse, namely, the donkey\u2019s matter. Socrates\u2019 soul is\nnot identical to the human being who is Socrates, for the human being\nis a composite of body and soul. Socrates is not a universal, even\nthough he is a human being. And the extension of Animal is greater\nthan the extension of Human Being.\n\nHowever, there is another question that does divide medieval\nphilosophers. Consider an integral whole. An integral whole is\ncomposed out of its parts. But is it true that an integral whole is no\nthing other than the sum of these parts? Some philosophers, such as\nAbelard and Ockham, argue that the whole is no thing other than the\nsum of its parts. Others, such as Duns Scotus, argue that the whole is\nsome thing which is really distinct from the sum of its parts. (On the\ndebate between Ockham and Scotus, see Cross 1995, Cross 1999, and\nNormore 2006.) The former philosophers perhaps base their position on\npassages from Boethius\u2019 treatments of mereology such as\nthis:\n\nEvery thing is the same as the whole. For example, Rome is the same as\nthat which is the whole citizenry. Each and every thing is also the\nsame as all its parts when they are gathered together into a unity.\nFor example, a man is the same as the head, throat, belly, feet, and\nthe rest of the parts gathered together and conjoined into a unity.\n(In Cic. top. 285.24\u201328)\n\n\nThose who claim that the whole is not identical to its parts often\nappeal to Aristotle. For example, an anonymous commentator on\nAristotle\u2019s Sophistical Refutations argues that\n\u201cthe five are not the two and the three\u201d on the grounds\nthat Aristotle has shown in his Metaphysics that \u201cthe\ncomposite, in general, is something other than its component\nparts\u201d (Quaestiones super Sophisticos Elenchos q. 831\n[1977, 346]; cf. Aristotle Metaphysics 8.6,\n1045a9\u201310).\n\nPeter Abelard provides one of the most sophisticated solutions to this\nproblem. Abelard emphatically asserts that the whole is no thing other\nthan the sum of its parts (Dialectica 344.34\u20135, and\n550.6\u20137; cf. 560.34\u2013561.2). But this is surely false.\nConsider a house. A house is composed out of a specific sum of boards\nand bricks. Yet these boards and bricks could be sitting together on\nthe building site without being arranged as a house. Hence, it is hard\nto see how the house is no thing other than the sum of the parts.\n\nAbelard will respond by drawing a distinction between the\nessentia, or concrete being, of a thing and the\n\u201cconditions\u201d (status) which a thing may possess\nor be in. True, the sum of boards and bricks must possess the\nappropriate arrangement in order to be a house (Logica\nIngredientibus II, 171.14\u201317; and Dialectica\n550.36\u2013551.4). But when the sum takes on a specific structure it\ndoes not take on an extra part. Whatever they are, Abelard makes it\nvery clear that structures and arrangements like those found in houses\nare not things (res), and only things can be parts.\nThe imposition of a structure upon the sum of the boards and bricks\ndoes not add a part to the thing that is that sum, and hence, the sum\nof the boards and bricks is the same in essentia as the\nhouse\u2014they are the very same thing. Nevertheless, there\ncan be different conditions in which this thing is. When the sum of\nboards and bricks are arranged in one way, they are in the condition\nof being a house. When they are arranged in other ways, they are not\nin this condition. In short, to claim that the house is no thing other\nthan the sum of its parts does not imply that the sum is in the state\nof being a house when the sum exists.\n\nAbelard\u2019s solution will only work if he can motivate the claim\nthat a thing taking on a new condition does not make a new thing.\nAnd medieval realists went after such reductivist programs in much the\nsame way that some contemporary realists do. Specifically, they often\npresented truth-maker challenges, or \u201canti-Razor\u201d\narguments (see Maurer 1984): If at one time this sum of boards and\nbricks is not a house and at another time it is a house, then there\nmust be some item in reality, some thing, that is absent at the\nformer time and present at the later time. The task, of course, is to\nidentify the right sort of thing that can be such a difference\nmaker.\n\nBut let us move on to consider another related puzzle about identity\nat a time. Abelard\u2019s characterization of numerical sameness and\ndifference seems to give us the tools to answer a common medieval\npuzzle which I will call the Problem of the Many Men. Versions of this\nproblem can be found in a number of medieval works (see, e.g., Abelard\nTheologia Christiana III, \u00a7 153 (1969, 252); William of\nSherwood Syncategoremata (O\u2019Donnell ed., 60); Albert of\nSaxony Quaestiones in Physicam I, qq. 7\u20138, and his\nSophismata 46, 25va\u2013vb). The puzzle can easily be generated\nusing a crude understanding of numerical sameness. Assume that\nSocrates\u2019 body is perfectly intact: he has all his limbs, and\ntheir parts. Now consider every part of Socrates\u2019 body except\none finger. Call this whole W. W is not numerically\nthe same as Socrates, so it appears that they must be numerically\ndistinct. Socrates\u2019 whole body is imbued with the soul of a man.\nBut it also happens that W is imbued with the soul of a man.\nSo, there are now two numerically distinct men where it initially\nappeared there was one. But it gets worse. Considering the body apart\nfrom one finger was only one of an indefinite number of such\nconsiderations. And by the same reasoning, these other bracketed\nwholes composed from Socrates\u2019 body are also men. Hence, it is\neasy to generate an indefinite number of numerically distinct men\nwhere commonsense tells us that there is only one.\n\nAbelard might appear to be capable of unraveling this puzzle\nby employing his distinction between difference in essentia\nand numerical difference, which he presents most clearly in his\nanalysis of the Trinity (Theologia Christiana III, \u00a7 139\nand \u00a7148 (1969, 247 and 250\u20131); see Brower 2004,\n226\u201334). Abelard\u2019s notion of sameness and difference\nin essentia is informed by his appreciation of the\nnotion of mereological overlap (see the section on Basic\nPrinciples/Other Mereological Concepts, in the entry on\n mereology).\n His appreciation of mereological overlap in and of itself is a\nwatershed, since he is one of the first (and perhaps one of the few)\nmedieval philosophers to clearly understand this\n phenomenon.[6]\n According to Abelard, x is the same in essentia as\ny if and only if every part of x is a part of\ny and every part of y is a part of x. In\nother words, x is the same in essentia as y\nif and only if x and y mereologically coincide. If\nx is the same in essentia as y, then\nx is numerically the same as y. However, if\nx is not the same in essentia as y, it does\nnot follow that x is numerically distinct from\ny. This is because x and y could\noverlap\u2014that is, share at least one part\u2014even if they do\nnot coincide. Thus, Abelard\u2019s answer to the Problem of\nthe Many Men is that while there are many overlapping men, each of\nwhich is different in essentia from the others, this does not\nentail that there are an indefinite number of numerically different\nmen. One might, however, wonder whether Abelard has completely\ndispelled the hint of paradox generated by the initial puzzle. After\nall, it would be nice to know which of these overlapping, but\nnon-coincident wholes is Socrates. All that Abelard\u2019s\ntheoretical tools allow us to do is to say that while there is\nthis whole which is imbued by Socrates\u2019 soul and there\nis that whole which is imbued by Socrates\u2019 soul, these\nwholes are not numerically many and, thus, there are not\nnumerically many men where intuitively we thought there was only one\n(see Normore 2006, 749).\n\nMost medieval philosophers tackle the Problem of the Many Men in\nanother manner. Albert of Saxony, for example, resolves the puzzle by\nclaiming that nothing which is a part of something else can be a\nnumerically distinct existing being (Quaes. in Arist.\nPhysicam I q. 8, 131\u201332; Sophismata 46, 25vb; cf.\nFitzgerald 2009). Socrates\u2019 body less the finger is not a\ndistinct human substance, since it is a part of a human substance,\nnamely, Socrates. Therefore, even if we grant that there are many\nthings present, there are not many distinct\nhumans present where we thought that there was only\nSocrates. If that appears to be an argument by stipulation, the reader\nmight find William of Sherwood\u2019s elaboration on this strategy\nhelpful (Syncategoremata (O\u2019Donnell ed., 61)). William\nconcedes that, because Socrates-less-the-finger is perfected by a\nhuman soul, it can in a certain respect be said to be a human\nbeing. But in this respect Socrates and Socrates-less-the-finger are\nperfected by the same soul and if one wants to count humans,\none counts human souls. Thus, Socrates and Socrates-less-the-finger\nare not numerically distinct humans. On the other hand, if\nSocrates-less-the-finger is considered as a part of something\nlarger that is also perfected by the same soul, then in this respect\nSocrates-less-the-finger is numerically different from Socrates, but\nit is not a human being. Considered in terms of its being a\npart, Socrates-less-the-finger is a part of a body of a human\nbeing, and a body of a human being is not a human. Hence, we count too\nmany humans only if we ignore these different respects under which the\npremises of the argument can be made true.\n4.2 Persistence\n\nMedieval philosophers also worry about the identity of objects over\ntime and through change. Medieval examinations of identity over time,\nor persistence, are often occasioned by reflection on the maximal\nproposition associated with the Topic from the integral whole, which\nstates:\n\nIf the whole is, the part is.\n\n\nThis maximal proposition, however, implies\n\nIf the part is not, the whole is not.\n\n\nBut this seems to entail that if Socrates\u2019 hand does not exist,\nSocrates does not exist.\n\nThere is an innocent interpretation of this Topical maxim. Recall that\n\u201cthe whole x\u201d can mean the complete x.\nAccordingly, to say that the whole is destroyed if the part is\ndestroyed, is merely to say that the whole is incomplete or\n\u201cmutilated\u201d if a part is removed. It might also be the\ncase that \u201cthe whole x\u201d merely signifies all the\nparts of x taken together. On this reading, the maximal\nproposition would merely imply that, if x does not exist,\nthen the whole consisting of x and some other parts does not\nexist. And, indeed, Boethius seems to mean only this:\n\nFor if a part of the whole perishes, the whole\u2014namely, the\n[whole] whose one part was destroyed\u2014will not exist. (On\nDivision 879c [Magee 1998, 14]).\n\n\nBoethius\u2019 assertion that the whole consisting of x\nand all the rest will perish when x perishes leaves\nit open whether the remaining parts are still, say, Socrates or a\nhouse. Naturally, the creative parts had to be present in\norder to create Socrates or the house. For example, this sum of wood,\ncement, and nails is the sum of the creative parts of a house. If\nthere had been no nails, wood, or cement, there would have been no\nhouse. Still, commonsense tells us that the creative parts need not\nremain present after the house has been created. Some boards and some\nnails may be replaced in the house, but this does not compromise the\nexistence of this house.\n\nDespite the appeal of commonsense, there were some medieval\nphilosophers who took the maximal proposition to imply that if\nSocrates loses a finger, Socrates ceases to exist. At least at one\npoint in his career, Peter Abelard appears to seriously entertain the\nradical reading of the maximal proposition (Henry 1991, 92\u2013139).\nAbelard himself might have eventually backed away from this view\n(Martin 1998), but there are reports that suggest some of\nAbelard\u2019s followers, the so-called Nominales, wholeheartedly\nembraced the extreme interpretation of the maximal proposition. One of\nthe positions associated with the Nominales was that \u201cnothing\ngrows\u201d (nihil crescit), and there is a surviving\ncommentary on the Categories with Nominalist features where\nthe author argues that any addition, removal, or even relocation of a\npart compromises the identity of the thing itself (Ebbesen 1999, 397).\nThis extreme interpretation is derived from the judgment that each\nwhole is the same thing as a unique set of parts. This house must be\ncomposed out of these nails, these boards, and this cement. If I use\nother nails or other boards, I could make a house, but not this very\nhouse. This premise is no doubt controversial, but Abelard and many of\nhis contemporaries have principled reasons for holding it. Abelard\nbelieves that the ultimate pieces of the universe are tiny,\nindivisible bits of matter, souls, and perhaps some forms. The items\nthat we experience are composites of these elements. Each element is\nself-identical. Composite beings are individuated by the elements that\nmake them up, and in the case of complex, composite beings\u2014such\nas artifacts and substances\u2014by the arrangement that these bits\nhave. Given such a universe, it is quite plausible to assume that the\nidentity of a composite item is solely determined by its parts. It\nwould then easily follow that the removal or addition of a composing\nelement entails that the new whole is not identical to the old whole.\nAnother whole similar to the original might exist after the\nmereological change take place, but strictly speaking the two wholes\nare not identical.\n\nMost medieval philosophers are not as extreme as the Nominales. Of\ncourse, there are those parts that are required to keep the whole\nintact, but there are also those parts that can be lost without\ncompromising the integrity of the whole. If we were to cut off\nSocrates\u2019 head, he would perish. But if we amputate\nSocrates\u2019 right hand, it seems that Socrates would not cease to\nexist. He would merely lack a hand. The parts required to keep a whole\nintact are called \u201cprincipal\u201d. Ones that could be lost\nwithout compromising the integrity of the whole were called\n\u201csecondary\u201d parts (Anonymous Introductiones maiores\nMontane 71va\u201372rb; Albertus Magnus Commentarii in De\ndiv. tract. 2, ch. 5 (Loe ed., 33\u20134); Buridan Summulae\nde Dialectica 6.4.4). Examples of principal parts would be the\nfoundation of the house, the heart of a cat, and the brain of\nSocrates. Examples of secondary parts are a brick in the house, a\nstrand of hair belonging to the cat, and a fingernail of Socrates.\n\nIn the Twelfth century there was a heated debate about how to\ndetermine whether this or that part is principal (see Pseudo-Joscelin\nDe generibus \u00a7\u00a7 3\u201320 (2014, 122\u201329;\nArlig 2013), for as Abelard pointed out the following account is\ninsufficient:\n\nx is a principal part of y if and only if the\nremoval of x entails the destruction of y.\n\n\nAbelard reminds his audience that even the extremist can accept this\naccount of principal parts; the only difference is that on his account\nevery part is a principal part (Dialectica\n549\u201352).\n\nThe best answer that twelfth-century thinkers come up with is that a\nprincipal part of x is that which, when removed, compromises\nthe form of x (Pseudo-Joscelin De generibus\n\u00a7\u00a7 23\u20136 (2014, 130\u201331); Arlig 2013,\n106\u201310). Many later medieval philosophers followed suit. At\nleast in the case of substances, the substantial form could do the\nmetaphysical work of guaranteeing persistence through time and change\n(Pasnau 2011, 689\u201392). For example, we have already seen that\nBurley draws a distinction between the whole secundum formam\nand the material whole. The whole considered formally persists so long\nas the form persists. The whole considered materially is the only\nwhole compromised by changes in material parts (De toto et\nparte, 301). Most commonsense objects are identified with a whole\nconsidered with respect to form, and so there would be no reason to\nthink that these things are substantially compromised by material\nchanges. (The fate of artifacts, would be different, as their forms\nare merely accidental forms. A mereological change in the case of an\nartifact would seem to entail that the initial artifact is replaced by\nanother one. But later medieval philosophers do not seem to be all\nthat troubled by these implications. Whether theologians\ncould stomach all the consequences that this view of artifacts entails\n(for example, for whether something remains ritually pure after it has\nbeen chipped) may be another matter. But this is an area whether\nfurther research is needed.)\n\nThis basic Aristotelian picture is complicated, if not outright\naltered, by several very influential fourteenth-century thinkers,\nincluding Ockham and Buridan (Normore 2006; Pasnau 2011,\n692\u2013702). We will consider Buridan\u2019s theory of identity\nover time and change (Quaestiones super De generatione et\ncorruptione 1.13; Quaestiones in Physicam 1.10; with\nEnglish paraphrase in Pluta 2001). According to Buridan, there are\nthree senses of numerical sameness: (1) x is\n\u201ctotally\u201d the same in number as y, (2) x\nis \u201cpartially\u201d the same in number as y, and (3)\nx is numerically the same as y in a \u201cless\nproper\u201d way. Something is totally the same in number if all its\nparts remain the same and it neither acquires nor loses any parts. In\nthis strictest of senses, no corruptible thing whatsoever persists\nthrough mereological change. Something is partially the same in number\nif its \u201cmost principal part\u201d remains numerically the same.\nThis is the sense that allows us to claim that Socrates is numerically\nthe same man now as that man ten years ago. In particular, it is\nSocrates\u2019 intellective soul which is the principal part and\nguarantor of persistence through change. Finally, something is less\nproperly the same in number if there is merely a continuous succession\nof beings that maintain a similar shape, disposition, and form. This\nless proper mode of numerical sameness allows us to claim that the\nNile River here today is numerically the same river as the Nile back\nin Herodotus\u2019 time. While it is probably not a surprise to learn\nthat rivers are the same in number only in a less proper sense, it is\nstriking that Buridan goes on to assert that plants and non-rational\nanimals too can only be numerically the same in this less proper sense\n(Quaestiones super De gen. 1.13 (2010, 114\u201315)).\nBuridan\u2019s reason for thinking this is that non-rational\ncreatures do not have the sort of soul that can act as a guarantor of\nless proper identity; rather, non-rational souls are themselves\naltered when the material parts are altered. Thus, over the span of a\nnormal lifetime, neither the matter nor the form of a horse or an\norchid remains numerically the same in anything other than a less\nproper\n sense.[7]\n\nBuridan\u2019s account appears to commit him to the view that the\naddition or subtraction of even tiny and seemingly inconsequential\nparts can bring about substantial change: strictly speaking we do not\nhave one horse, but rather a succession of horses unified by three\nfacts, namely, (1) these successive beings have some of the same\nparts, (2) this line of succession is continuous, and (3) each member\nin the line of succession is a horse. The picture we get has many\nsimilarities to the accounts of identity that we get in early modern\nthinkers like Hobbes and Locke. Thus, it is tempting to think that we\nare witnessing in Buridan\u2019s work one more way in which the\nAristotelian scholastic edifice is being eroded to the point that it\nwill quickly crumble in the seventeenth century (see Pasnau 2011, 703\nf., and Lagerlund 2012, esp. pp. 481\u20132).\n5. Concluding remarks\n\nMedieval philosophers study a variety of wholes and parts, and they\noften do so with a remarkable degree of sophistication. To be sure,\nsome aspects of medieval mereology are idiosyncratic, but many of the\npuzzles that medieval philosophers wrestle with are analogous to ones\nthat interest contemporary students of logic and metaphysics. Medieval\nphilosophers are particularly attuned to the relationship between\nmereology and various problems in metaphysics, and many of their\nsolutions to puzzles of identity and survival are embraced by\nphilosophers in other periods. Even the idiosyncratic aspects of\nmedieval mereology reveal a sophisticated appreciation of three\nfundamental questions in mereology, namely, what items are wholes,\nwhat items are parts, and under what conditions is one item a part of\nanother item. This survey can only hint at the richness of medieval\nmereology. In part, this is due to the overwhelming number of medieval\nauthors who say something or other, somewhere or other, about parts\nand wholes. But it is also due to the fact that there are still more\ntexts to be unearthed, properly edited, and studied with care. Based\non what we have already discovered, we should be confident that we\nwill find many more interesting reflections on parts and wholes and\nthat we will uncover further connections between medieval mereology\nand more recent theories of parts and wholes.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Ancient and Medieval Texts Cited", "Select Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Ancient and Medieval Texts Cited": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Albertus Magnus, <em>Commentarii in librum Boethii de\nDivisione</em>, P.
