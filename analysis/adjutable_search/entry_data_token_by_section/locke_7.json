    "main_text": "The Limits of Human Understanding || Book III\n2.3 Book III\n\nLocke devotes Book III of An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding to language. This is a strong indication that Locke\nthinks issues about language were of considerable importance in\nattaining knowledge. At the beginning of the Book he notes the\nimportance of abstract general ideas to knowledge. These serve as\nsorts under which we rank all the vast multitude of particular\nexistences. Thus, abstract ideas and classification are of central\nimportance in Locke\u2019s discussion of language and its importance\nfor knowledge. Without general terms and classes we would be faced\nwith the impossible task of trying to know a vast world of\nparticulars.\n\nThere is a clear connection between Books II and III in that Locke\nclaims that words stand for ideas. In his discussion of language Locke\ndistinguishes words according to the categories of ideas established\nin Book II of the Essay. So there are ideas of substances,\nsimple modes, mixed modes, relations and so on. It is in this context\nthat Locke makes the distinction between real and nominal essences\nnoted above. Perhaps because of his focus on the role that kind terms\nplay in classification, Locke pays vastly more attention to nouns than\nto verbs. Locke recognizes that not all words relate to ideas. There\nare also the many particles, words that \u201c\u2026signify the\nconnexion that the Mind gives to Ideas, or Propositions, one with\nanother\u201d (II.7.1, N: 471). Still, it is the relation of words\nand ideas that gets most of Locke\u2019s attention in Book III.\n\nNorman Kretzmann calls the claim that \u201cwords in their primary or\nimmediate signification signify nothing but the ideas in the mind\nof him that uses them\u201d (III.2.2) \u201cLocke\u2019s main\nsemantic thesis\u201d (see Kretzmann 1968:179). This thesis has often\nbeen criticized as a classic blunder in semantic theory. Thus Mill,\nfor example, wrote, \u201cWhen I say, \u2018the sun is the cause of\nthe day\u2019, I do not mean that my idea of the sun causes or\nexcites in me the idea of day\u201d (Mill 1843: bk 1, ch. 2, \u00a7\n1). This criticism of Locke\u2019s account of language parallels the\n\u201cveil of perception\u201d critique of his account of perception\nand suggests that Locke is not distinguishing the meaning of a word\nfrom its reference. Kretzmann, however, argues persuasively that Locke\ndistinguishes between meaning and reference and that ideas provide the\nmeaning but not the reference of words. Thus, the line of criticism\nrepresented by the quotation from Mill is ill founded.\n\nIn addition to the kinds of ideas noted above, there are also\nparticular and abstract ideas. Particular ideas have in them the ideas\nof particular places and times which limit the application of the idea\nto a single individual, while abstract general ideas leave out the\nideas of particular times and places in order to allow the idea to\napply to other similar qualities or things. There has been\nconsiderable philosophical and scholarly debate about the nature of\nthe process of abstraction and Locke\u2019s account of it. Berkeley\nargued that the process as Locke conceives it is incoherent. In part\nthis is because Berkeley is an imagist\u2014that is he believes that\nall ideas are images. If one is an imagist it becomes impossible to\nimagine what idea could include both the ideas of a right and\nequilateral triangle. Michael Ayers has recently argued that Locke too\nwas an imagist. This would make Berkeley\u2019s criticism of Locke\nvery much to the point. Ayers\u2019 claim, however, has been disputed\n(see, for example, Soles 1999). The process of abstraction is of\nconsiderable importance to human knowledge. Locke thinks most words we\nuse are general (III.1.1, N: 409). Clearly, it is only general or\nsortal ideas that can serve in a classificatory scheme.\n\nIn his discussion of names of substances and in the contrast between\nnames of substances and names of modes, a number of interesting\nfeatures of Locke\u2019s views about language and knowledge emerge.\nPhysical substances are atoms and things made up of atoms. But we have\nno experience of the atomic structure of horses and tables. We know\nhorses and tables mainly by secondary qualities such as color, taste\nand smell and so on and primary qualities such as shape, motion and\nextension. So, since the real essence (the atomic constitution) of a\nhorse is unknown to us, our word \u2018horse\u2019 cannot get its\nmeaning from that real essence. What the general word signifies is the\ncomplex of ideas we have decided are parts of the idea of that sort of\nthing. These ideas we get from experience. Locke calls such a general\nidea that picks out a sort, the nominal essence of that sort.\n\nOne of the central issues in Book III has to do with classification.\nOn what basis do we divide things into kinds and organize those kinds\ninto a system of species and genera? In the Aristotelian and\nScholastic tradition that Locke rejects, necessary properties are\nthose that an individual must have in order to exist and continue to\nexist. These contrast with accidental properties. Accidental\nproperties are those that an individual can gain and lose and yet\ncontinue in existence. If a set of necessary properties is shared by a\nnumber of individuals, that set of properties constitutes the essence\nof a natural kind. The borders between kinds are supposed to be sharp\nand determinate. The aim of Aristotelian science is to discover the\nessences of natural kinds. Kinds can then be organized hierarchically\ninto a classificatory system of species and genera. This\nclassification of the world by natural kinds will be unique and\nprivileged because it alone corresponds to the structure of the world.\nThis doctrine of essences and kinds is often called Aristotelian\nessentialism. Locke rejects a variety of aspects of this doctrine. He\nrejects the notion that an individual has an essence apart from being\ntreated as belonging to a kind. He also rejects the claim that there\nis a single classification of things in nature that the natural\nphilosopher should seek to discover. He holds that there are many\npossible ways to classify the world each of which might be\nparticularly useful depending on one\u2019s purposes.\n\nLocke\u2019s pragmatic account of language and the distinction\nbetween nominal and real essences constitute an anti-essentialist\nalternative to this Aristotelian essentialism and its correlative\naccount of the classification of natural kinds. He claims that there\nare no fixed boundaries in nature to be discovered\u2014that is there\nare no clear demarcation points between species. There are always\nborderline cases. There is debate over whether Locke\u2019s view is\nthat this lack of fixed boundaries is true on both the level of\nappearances and nominal essences, and atomic constitutions and real\nessences, or on the level of nominal essences alone. The first view is\nthat Locke holds that there are no Aristotelian natural kinds on\neither the level of appearance or atomic reality. The second view\nholds that Locke thinks there are Aristotelian natural kinds on the\natomic level, it is simply that we cannot get at them or know what\nthey are. On either of these interpretations, the real essence cannot\nprovide the meaning to names of substances. A.O. Lovejoy in the\nGreat Chain of Being, and David Wiggins are proponents of the\nsecond interpretation while Michael Ayers and William Uzgalis argue\nfor the first (Uzgalis 1988; Ayers 1991: II. 70).\n\nBy contrast, the ideas that we use to make up our nominal essences\ncome to us from experience. Locke claims that the mind is active in\nmaking our ideas of sorts and that there are so many properties to\nchoose among that it is possible for different people to make quite\ndifferent ideas of the essence of a certain substance. This has given\nsome commentators the impression that the making of sorts is utterly\narbitrary and conventional for Locke and that there is no basis for\ncriticizing a particular nominal essence. Sometimes Locke says things\nthat might suggest this. But this impression should be resisted. Peter\nAnstey has characterized Locke\u2019s conventionalism about\nclassificatory terms as both constrained and convergent (Anstey 2011:\n209, 212). Locke claims that while the making of nominal essences is\nthe work of the understanding, that work is constrained both by usage\n(where words stand for ideas that are already in use) and by the fact\nthat substance words are supposed to copy the properties of the\nsubstances they refer to. Locke says that our ideas of kinds of\nsubstances have as their archetype the complex of properties that\nproduce the appearances we use to make our nominal essences and which\ncause the unity of the complex of ideas that appear to us regularly\nconjoined. The very notion of an archetype implies constraints on what\nproperties (and hence what ideas) can go together. If there were no\nsuch constraints there could be no archetype. (For further discussion\nof the nominal-real essence distinction see the entry\n Locke on Real Essences).\n\nLet us begin with the usage of words. It is important in a community\nof language users that words be used with the same meaning. If this\ncondition is met it facilitates the chief end of language which is\ncommunication. If one fails to use words with the meaning that most\npeople attach to them, one will fail to communicate effectively with\nothers. Thus one would defeat the main purpose of language. It should\nalso be noted that traditions of usage for Locke can be modified.\nOtherwise we would not be able to improve our knowledge and\nunderstanding by getting more clear and determinate ideas.\n\nIn the making of the names of substances, there is a period of\ndiscovery as the abstract general idea is put together (e.g. the\ndiscovery of violets or gold) and then the naming of that idea and\nthen its introduction into language. Language itself is viewed as an\ninstrument for carrying out the mainly prosaic purposes and practices\nof everyday life. Ordinary people are the chief makers of\nlanguage.\n\n\nVulgar Notions suit vulgar Discourses; and both though confused\nenough, yet serve pretty well for the Market and the Wake. Merchants\nand Lovers, Cooks and Taylors, have Words wherewith to dispatch their\nordinary affairs; and so, I think, might Philosophers and Disputants\ntoo, if they had a mind to understand and to be clearly understood.\n(III.11.10, N: 514)\n\n\nThese ordinary people use a few apparent qualities, mainly ideas of\nsecondary qualities to make ideas and words that will serve their\npurposes.\n\nNatural philosophers (i.e. scientists) come along later to try to\ndetermine if the connections between properties which the ordinary\nfolk have put together in a particular idea in fact holds in nature.\nScientists are seeking to find the necessary connections between\nproperties. Still, even scientists, in Locke\u2019s view, are\nrestricted to using observable (and mainly secondary) qualities to\ncategorize things in nature. Sometimes, the scientists may find that\nthe ordinary folk had erred, as when they called whales\n\u2018fish\u2019. A whale is not a fish, as it turns out, but a\nmammal. There is a characteristic group of qualities that fish have\nthat whales do not have. There is a characteristic group of qualities\nthat mammals have that whales also have. To classify a whale as a\nfish, therefore, is a mistake. Similarly, we might make an idea of\ngold that only included being a soft metal and gold color. If so, we\nwould be unable to distinguish between gold and fool\u2019s gold.\nThus, since it is the mind that makes complex ideas (they are\n\u2018the workmanship of the understanding\u2019), one is free to\nput together any combination of ideas one wishes and call it what one\nwill. But the product of such work is open to criticism, either on the\ngrounds that it does not conform to already current usage or that it\ninadequately represents the archetypes that it is supposed to copy in\nthe world. We engage in such criticism in order to improve human\nunderstanding of the material world and thus the human condition. This\nis the convergent character of Locke\u2019s conventionalism. In\nbecoming more accurate, the nominal essence converges on the real\nessence.\n\nHowever, we should not forget the master-builders that Locke mentions\nat the beginning of the Essay. Stephen Gaukroger (2010)\nclaims that Locke\u2019s great achievement was to provide a\nphilosophical justification for the kind of experimental philosophy\nthat Boyle\u2019s work on the air pump, and his and Newton\u2019s\nwork on colors, as well as Sydenham\u2019s observational medicine.\nAll of these had been attacked for not providing explanations in terms\nof matter theory. Thus, Locke is justifying the autonomy of\nexperimental philosophy. Such experimental explanations depend solely\non the relation between phenomena, even when there is some\nmicro-corpuscular basis for the phenomena being explained. According\nto Gaukroger, this is Locke\u2019s contribution to the collapse of\nmechanism. For the details of the problem and its solution, see\nChapters 4 and 5 of Gaukroger (2010).\n\nThe distinction between modes and substances is surely one of the most\nimportant in Locke\u2019s philosophy. In contrast with substances,\nmodes are dependent existences\u2014they can be thought of as the\nordering of substances. These are technical terms for Locke, so we\nshould see how they are defined. Locke writes:\n\n\nFirst, Modes I call such complex Ideas, which\nhowever compounded, contain not in themselves the supposition of\nsubsisting by themselves; such are the ideas signified by the Words\nTriangle, Gratitude, Murther, etc. (II.12.4, N: 165)\n\n\nLocke goes on to distinguish between simple and mixed modes. He\nwrites:\n\n\nOf these Modes, there are two sorts, which deserve distinct\nconsideration. First, there are some that are only variations, or\ndifferent combinations of the same simple Idea, without the\nmixture of any other, as a dozen or score; which are nothing but the\nideas of so many distinct unities being added together, and\nthese I call simple Modes, as being contained within the\nbounds of one simple Idea. Secondly, There are others,\ncompounded of Ideas of several kinds, put together to make\none complex one; v.g. Beauty, consisting of a certain\ncombination of Colour and Figure, causing Delight to the Beholder;\nTheft, which being the concealed change of the Possession of\nany thing, without the consent of the Proprietor, contains, as is\nvisible, a combination of several Ideas of several kinds; and\nthese I call Mixed Modes. (II.12.5, N: 165)\n\n\nWhen we make ideas of modes, the mind is again active, but the\narchetype is in our mind. The question becomes whether things in the\nworld fit our ideas, and not whether our ideas correspond to the\nnature of things in the world. Our ideas are adequate. Thus we define\n\u2018bachelor\u2019 as an unmarried, adult, male human being. If we\nfind that someone does not fit this definition, this does not reflect\nbadly on our definition, it simply means that that individual does not\nbelong to the class of bachelors. Modes give us the ideas of\nmathematics, of morality, of religion and politics and indeed of human\nconventions in general. Since these modal ideas are not only made by\nus but serve as standards that things in the world either fit or do\nnot fit and thus belong or do not belong to that sort, ideas of modes\nare clear and distinct, adequate and complete. Thus in modes, we get\nthe real and nominal essences combined. One can give precise\ndefinitions of mathematical terms (that is, give necessary and\nsufficient conditions), and one can give deductive demonstrations of\nmathematical truths. Locke sometimes says that morality too is capable\nof deductive demonstration. Though pressed by his friend William\nMolyneux to produce such a demonstrative morality, Locke never did so.\nThe entry\n Locke\u2019s moral philosophy\n provides an excellent discussion of Locke\u2019s views on morality\nand issues related to them for which there is no room in this general\naccount. The terms of political discourse also have some of the same\nmodal features for Locke. When Locke defines the states of nature,\nslavery, and war in the Second Treatise of Government, for\nexample, we are presumably getting precise modal definitions from\nwhich one can deduce consequences. It is possible, however, that with\npolitics we are getting a study that requires both experience as well\nas the deductive modal aspect.\n",
