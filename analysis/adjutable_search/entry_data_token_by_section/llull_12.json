Theory of Knowledge\n\nHomo est animal homificans / Man is a manifying animal.\n\n\nIn this definition of man in the Ars Brevis 9-IV, Ramon Llull\nidentifies human nature with its activity, with its dynamic principle\nas L\u00f3pez Alcaide (2016) explains. Homificans is\nproduced through the realization of the three main activities of the\nhuman soul, which for Llull are knowing, remembering, and loving,\nwhich correspond to the three superior faculties of the soul:\nunderstanding, memory, and will.\n\nIn Liber de homine, Llull acknowledges that man must know\nwhat man is, and as he is able to know himself, he will be able to\nknow other men and, naturally, God as well. However, the knowledge\nthat man can reach is different from the rest of the beings. Animals,\nfor example, can only know through senses and imagination, whereas\nangels can only intellectually know through themselves. As man is\nconstituted by a soul and a body, he can know through the senses but\nis not limited by them. He is capable of going up the ladder and\nunderstanding other beings through the principles; additionally, he\ncan also go down the ladder and understand the principles through\nbeings.\n\nThe ascent and descent describe the two paths the soul can traverse to\nobtain knowledge of the world. They are different but supplementary\nways. The ascent starts with corporeal objects, whose sensible species\n(form or similarity) are captured by the external senses and\ntransformed into internal species by the imagination; then, the higher\nfaculties of the soul in the intellect transform them into knowledge\nof exterior beings. The descent is the opposite path, from the\nuniversal to the particular. It takes the principles as starting\npoints through which the human soul can recognize these\nprinciples\u2014goodness, truth, etc.\u2014in particular beings.\n",
