However, she also has\nthe ability to \u2018translate\u2019 her knowledge into metaphors\nand symbolic representations and present them, by means of rhetorical\ndevices, in a convincing\n fashion.[33]\n From the perspective of the majority of people, this metaphorical\naccount appears to be some sort of supernatural, divine revelation. In\na way, it is certainly \u2018divine\u2019, given al-Farabi\u2019s\ncosmology. However, from the perspective of philosophy, it is clearly\nnot supernatural; it is merely a symbolic representation faithfully\nencapsulating the essentials of metaphysics, natural philosophy,\nanthropology, and philosophy of\n society.[34]\n\nReligion, embracing a doctrinal as well as a legal branch, is thus the\nmost important element of rulership. It is an enterprise that must be\ncarried on beyond the death of the first ruler, fostered and further\ndeveloped by subsequent rulers and those savants who in a given\nsociety are situated fairly high in the natural hierarchy, being\nintelligent and erudite themselves, and thus \u2018naturally\u2019\nin charge of disseminating the knowledge required for happiness. In\nparticular, those actions which the first ruler, for whatever reason,\ndid not determine, will have to be legislated at some\n point.[35]\n Notably, even though the supposed similitude of society with the\ncosmos, as well as al-Farabi\u2019s own parlance, suggest that the\n\u2018natural\u2019 form of government would be a monarchy, he\nremains fairly noncommittal on this\n topic.[36]\n\nObviously, if there is at a given time in a given society a human\nbeing unifying the required qualities, she will be the natural leader.\nAnd in agreement with Plato\u2019s Politeia, al-Farabi seems\nto believe that the founding act of creating a religion suited to\nserve as the \u2018constitution\u2019 of an excellent\npolis, presupposes a single, first ruler acting as the\noriginal lawgiver. However, if subsequently there is nowhere in the\nmadina a single person incorporating these qualities, several\npeople with complementary properties should team up and henceforth\nguide the community. This clearly exhibits that al-Farabi was not\nparticularly interested in concrete political structures and systems.\nHis attention, instead, was directed towards the metaphysical\nprinciples underlying human associations and their normative\nimplications.\n\nThis peculiar stance is clearly displayed in al-Farabi\u2019s\ndiscussion of deficient cities and societies. While the details differ\nacross his various treatises dedicated to this topic, the scale by\nmeans of which he assesses \u2018excellence\u2019 and\n\u2018deficiency\u2019 is consistently those two factors identified\nabove: knowledge and action, on both the common and the class-related\nlevels. Thus, for instance, in the Political Regime he\ndistinguishes six deficient forms of cities, among which he lists the\n\u201cnecessary societies\u201d (Political Regime C, 2, 93:\n76, substituting \u2018societies\u2019 for\n\u2018associations\u2019). This kind of society or city, he\nexplains,\n\n\n\u2026 is the one in which there is mutual assistance for earning\nwhat is necessary to constitute and safeguard bodies. \u2026. Among\nthe necessary cities, there may be some that bring together all of the\narts that procure what is necessary. Their ruler is the one who has\nfine governance and excellent stratagems for using [the citizens] so\nthat they gain the necessary things and fine governance in preserving\nthese things for them or who bestows these things on them from what he\nhas. (Political Regime C, 2, 94: 77)\n\n\nAt first glance, this seems just fine and precisely what good\nrulership ought to accomplish. All the trades and professions required\nfor the polis to subsist are extant. The ruler is by no means\na tyrant exploiting her subjects, but rather excels in helping them to\ngain these goods, preserving them and distributing them among the\nlatter. Nevertheless, what is deficient in this type of society is\nadumbrated in the first phrase of the quote: the mutual cooperation\ndescribed here is directed exclusively towards the well-being of\nbodies. It thus neglects society\u2019s proper purpose, namely, the\npromotion of humanity\u2019s natural telos, which certainly\npresupposes but cannot be reduced to well-functioning bodies.\n\nSociety, according to al-Farabi, as can be deduced from these\nobservations, ought to be a joint venture, grounded in the true\nunderstanding of reality and its principles, and guided by a religion\nwhich translates this understanding, first, into generally\ncomprehensible doctrines, i.e., similitudes, and, second, activities\nsuited to purify and prepare the citizens\u2019 souls in their quest\nfor felicity. Thus, it clearly ought to transcend the mere\nsatisfaction of daily needs and wants. Therefore, al-Farabi\nconcludes,\n\n\n\u2026 the first ruler of the excellent city must already have\nthorough cognizance of theoretical philosophy; for he cannot\nunderstand anything pertaining to God\u2019s, may He be exalted,\ngovernance of the world so as to follow it except from that source. It\nis clear, in addition, that all of this is impossible unless there is\na common religion in the cities that brings together their opinions,\nbeliefs, and actions; that renders their divisions harmonious, linked\ntogether, and well ordered; and at that point they will support one\nanother in their actions and assist one another to reach the purpose\nthat is sought after, namely, ultimate happiness.
