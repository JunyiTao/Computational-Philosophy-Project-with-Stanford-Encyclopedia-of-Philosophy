    "preamble": "\n\n\nJoseph Albo (c. 1380\u20131444) was a Jewish philosopher active in\nChristian Spain in the first half of the fifteenth century. His\ntheoretical work found expression in his well-known opus Sefer\nha-\u2018Ikkarim [Book of Principles], completed in 1425 in\nthe town of Soria in the crown of Castile. In this work, Albo\naddresses a wide variety of interpretive, theological and\nphilosophical issues, in a style integrating logical, methodical\nanalyses with exegetical discussions. Albo\u2019s composition reveals his\nexposure to the works of many Jewish philosophers that preceded him,\nparticularly Maimonides, Hasdai Crescas (Albo\u2019s teacher in his\nformative years), and his contemporary, Simeon ben Zemah Duran. The\nhistorical circumstances in which he functioned, especially the\nCatholic Church\u2019s persecution of the Jews in Christian Spain, led him\nto contribute to the anti-Christian polemic, and apparently also\npermitted his exposure to the writings of such Christian philosophers\nas Thomas Aquinas.\n\n\nAlbo\u2019s central contribution to the history of Jewish philosophy is his\ntheory of principles. In his theory, he determines the fundamental,\nnecessary beliefs that a person must uphold in order to belong to the\nsystem called \u201cdivine law.\u201d This theory serves as an\nalternative to previous lists of principles, especially the thirteen\nprinciples of faith formulated by Maimonides. Albo\u2019s list includes\nonly three fundamental beliefs: the existence of God, the divine\norigin of the Torah, and reward and punishment. The following\nparagraphs will outline Albo\u2019s theory and several of the prominent\nissues in his thought, such as the theory of law, the theory of divine\nattributes, the theory of human perfection and the theory of\nprovidence and reward.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\n\nThe known details of Albo\u2019s life are sparse. As far as we know,\nhe was born in Christian Spain in the crown of Aragon around 1380, and\ndied in the crown of Castile around 1444. In documenting the\nhighlights of his career, we should first mention his period of study\nin the school of Hasdai Crescas in Saragossa. Further, in\n1413\u20131414 he played a dominant role in the Disputation at\nTortosa, a major public polemic between the Jewish convert to\nChristianity Geronimo de Santa Fe (formerly Joshua Lorki), who\nrepresented the pope, and delegates from many Jewish communities in\nChristian Spain. In this debate, Albo represented the Jewish community\nof Daroca in Aragon (Graetz 1894, 179\u2013220; Baer 1961,\n170\u2013232; Rauschenbach 2002, 11\u201347). After this community\nwas decimated in 1415, he moved to the town of Soria in Castile\n(Gonzalo Maeso 1971, 131; Motis Dolader 1990, 148). But Albo is mainly\nknown for his philosophical treatise,\nSefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim, which he finished around 1425. Aside from\nacting as a philosopher and spiritual leader, Albo served as a\npreacher and possibly also as a physician. Apparently, Albo had a\ncommand of Spanish and Latin in addition to Hebrew, the language of\nSefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim (Husik 1928\u201330, 67), but we cannot\ndetermine his level of fluency in Arabic.\n2.  Historical Background\n\n\nThe roots of Albo\u2019s philosophical theory are located deep within the\nground of the historical reality in which he lived and worked. The\ncentral circumstance that directly shaped his thought was the\ndistressed state of Jewish society in Christian Spain. Beginning in the\nfourteenth century, the Jews in Spain were subject to religious\npersecution on the part of the Catholic Church and Christian society in\ngeneral. Jewish thought also suffered from sharp ideological conflict\nbetween conservative thinkers and rationalists over both theological\nand social issues.\n\n\nFirst of all, in pressuring the Jews to convert, the Christian\nauthorities instituted extreme economic measures and passed\ndiscriminatory social legislation. They used coercive tactics in their\nexhortations. They also organized harsh pogroms, such as those of\n1391. These repressive measures forced many Jews to die a martyr\u2019s\ndeath. They also led to mass conversion of Jews to Christianity and to\ndeterioration on the social, economic, and spiritual planes (Baer\n1961, 95\u2013243; Netanyahu 1966, cf. index\n[\u201cConversions\u201d]; Ben-Sasson 1984, 208\u2013220,\n232\u2013238; Gutwirth 1993).\n\n\nIn addition, this period witnessed the revival of the dispute between\nfollowers of Maimonides and his opponents. On one side of this\nconflict stood the rationalists. They espoused the study of philosophy\nand attempted to integrate it into their religious-spiritual world\nwhile resolving the contradictions that emerged between philosophy and\nthe sources of revelation. On the other side stood the conservatives,\nwho rejected the study of philosophy. They adhered to the classic\nreligious sources, the Bible and the Talmud, and viewed kabbalistic\nliterature as a continuation of the chain of revelation. One of the\nfocal points of the conflict between these two theological schools\nwas the exchange of mutual accusations on the issue of responsibility\nfor the dire situation of Jewish society under Christian persecution\n(Schwartz 1991).\n\n\nModern scholars have conducted comprehensive studies of the\nrelationship between the characteristics of Jewish philosophy in Spain\nduring the fifteenth century, including Albo\u2019s thought, and the\nhistorical reality of that period (Baer 1961, 232\u2013243; Davidson\n1983, 112\u2013113; Cohen 1993; Manekin 1997).\n3. Introduction to Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim\n\nSefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim is Albo\u2019s monumental philosophical\ntreatise. This book offers an extensive description of the author\u2019s\ntheoretical doctrine. Forming the basis of this doctrine and the\nframework for the rest of his formulations are his principles of\nfaith, which attempt to define the beliefs that are the necessary\nfundamentals of a system of laws whose source is the divine. Before we\nexamine the various philosophical views incorporated within this book,\nwe will offer a concise description of its structure, stylistic\ncharacteristics, and goals.\n\nSefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim is composed of a preface, which\nincludes a highly detailed table of contents; an introduction; and\nfour treatises divided into chapters. Although Albo completed writing\nthe book around 1425, scholars have long agreed that before the book\nwas published in its entirety, a preliminary version appeared,\ncomprising the first of the four treatises (Back 1869, 8\u201310;\nT\u00e4nzer 1896, 19\u201322, 27; Schweid 1967, 25).\n\n\nIn the first treatise of Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim, Albo\npresents in detail his theory of principles and the various issues it\nincludes. Albo points out several problems with the lists of\nprinciples of faith proposed by his predecessors. In particular, he\nchallenges Maimonides\u2019 list of thirteen principles of faith,\nproposing in their place a concise list numbering only three basic\nbeliefs.  Absent these beliefs, Albo believes that divine law has no\nexistence or significance: 1) the existence of God, 2) the divine\norigin of the Torah, and 3) reward and punishment. This list\ndetermines the structure of the entire book, since the following three\ntreatises address each one of the three principles in turn. The main\ntopic of the second treatise is the existence of God, and it discusses\nthe theory of divinity, especially the theory of divine\nattributes. The third treatise, whose main topic is the divine origin\nof the Torah, covers the issues of human perfection, general prophecy,\nand Mosaic prophecy and law. It concludes with a thorough discussion\nof the religious emotions of fear and love of God. The fourth and last\ntreatise, whose main subject is reward and punishment, divides into\ntwo sections. The first section describes the theory of divine\nprovidence, the problem of evil and the significance of the precepts\nof prayer and repentance. The second section in the fourth treatise\nspeaks of the theory of recompense, emphasizing that of the world to\ncome. We should note here that Albo\u2019s theory of principles also\nincludes additional components.  Each one of the principles\nnecessarily leads to further beliefs, which he calls\n\u201croots,\u201d and these in turn lead to a third level of less\nimportant beliefs, which he calls \u201cbranches.\u201d\n\n\nThe language of Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim is straightforward, and its\nphilosophical arguments are formulated in a relatively simple and\nclear manner. These characteristics mean that a broad audience of\nreaders can approach this philosophical work on their\nown. Furthermore, the modern reader can rely on Albo\u2019s clear\nformulations to gain a preliminary acquaintance with many of the\nphilosophical viewpoints offered in the general framework of medieval\nJewish philosophy.\n\n\nAn additional stylistic aspect of Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim touches\ndirectly on the body of his theory. The book includes a number of\ninternal contradictions on a wide variety of philosophical issues.\nThis fact has led most scholars to the conclusion that this is an\neclectic work, lacking originality and vision, at a low philosophical\nlevel (Guttmann 1955; Guttmann 1964, 247\u2013251; Ravitzky 1988,\n104\u2013105). Yet recent scholars have proposed a new angle of\nperception on the significance of these internal contradictions,\nidentifying in Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim an esoteric writing style\nsimilar to that of Maimonides\u2019 Guide of the\nPerplexed. According to this viewpoint, the internal\ncontradictions are not the result of lack of attention on the part of\nan eclectic and average philosopher who combined various sources\nwithout regard to the differences between them. On the contrary, they\nbelieve these contradictions demonstrate meticulous attention on the\npart of the philosopher. The maverick position claims that Albo\nintentionally embedded in his book conflicting opinions in order to\nhide his true viewpoint on various theological issues from certain\ngroups of readers. Among other evidence, this research position relies\non Albo\u2019s explicit statement in the introductory comment to the second\ntreatise (Schwartz 2002, 183\u2013196; Ehrlich 2009a).\n\n\nMost scholars assume that we should understand Albo\u2019s goal in\nwriting Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim against the\nbackground of the historical reality in which he lived. As indicated,\nthe book was written as an attempt to address the severe social and\nreligious distress of the Jews of Christian Spain in the late\nfourteenth \u2013 early fifteenth centuries. In the framework of this\napproach, we may discern two different goals that the book intends to\nserve.\n\nSocial goal \u2013to offer a rationalist\napologetic for Judaism alongside a refutation of the doctrines of\nChristianity, with the aim of limiting the phenomenon of conversion and\nthe spiritual decline of the Jews of Christian Spain at that time\n(Husik 1928\u201330, 62\u201365).\n\n\nTheoretical goal \u2013 to redefine the\nprinciples of Judaism and discuss its theoretical relation to\nphilosophy, in light of the intensification of internal arguments on\nthese issues within Jewish thought during the period discussed (Back\n1869, 5\u20136; Lerner 2000, 90\u201395).\n\n\nSefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim was first published in 1485 as one of the\nfirst works of Jewish philosophy to reach the printing press. The book\nmade a considerable impact throughout the fifteenth century, with\nrenowned Jewish philosophers citing it and contending with its\nideas. Among them we may name such personalities as Isaac Arama,\nAbraham Bibago and Isaac Abravanel. From the sixteenth to the\neighteenth centuries, his thought continued to engage Jewish and\nnon-Jewish philosophers, including Baruch Spinoza, Moses Mendelssohn,\nand several Christian theologians. During this period, two authors\nwrote commentaries on Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim: Jacob Koppelman\n(Ohel Ya\u2018akov, Freiburg 1584) and Gedaliah Lipschitz (Etz\nShatul, Venice 1618). In addition, the book was translated into\nLatin, German, English and Russian, and its first treatise was\ntranslated into Italian. In 1929, Isaac Husik published a critical\nedition of Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim, including his translation of\nthe book into English, an introduction, and detailed notes and indices\n(Albo 1929).\n\n\nBefore taking up our discussion of Albo\u2019s thought, we must point out a\nsignificant methodological problem that this discussion entails. On\nthe one hand, the common opinion in the literature on Albo estimates\nthat he was not an original philosopher at all, and that the body of\nhis book merely summarizes the various approaches he knew from the\nworks of the Jewish philosophers that preceded him. This theory, in\nits extreme version, argues that even the theory of principles, the\nmain reason for his book\u2019s renown, is not Albo\u2019s unique creation. In\ncontrast, a more recent trend in research on Albo\u2019s work identifies\nclear characteristics of esoteric writing in his book. This theory\ninterprets the conflicting opinions on the issues in the book as\nbelonging to two separate layers of writing \u2013 the external,\nexoteric layer, and the inner, esoteric layer. In many cases, these\ntwo research approaches lead to differing opinions regarding the\nquestion of Albo\u2019s independent philosophical positions.\n\n\nBecause of this, the overview below will present the central issues\naddressed in Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim with a faithful reflection of\nthe state of present research on Albo\u2019s philosophy. At the same time,\nwe will refrain from categorizing his various philosophical\nviews. This essay will discuss Albo\u2019s theories of: (1) law, (2)\nprinciples, (3) divinity, (4) humanity, and (5) providence and\nrecompense.\n4. The Theory of Law\n\n\nIn striving to formulate a list of the fundamental beliefs of religion\nfrom within his theory of principles (which we will explain in the\nnext section), Albo abandons the status quo of similar lists composed\nby his predecessors. Instead of naming the principles of Mosaic law\n(\u201cthe Torah of Moses\u201d) as, for example, Maimonides did in\nhis well-known list of thirteen principles, Albo widens his target and\nlists the principles of \u201cdivine law.\u201d By this term he\nrefers to the entire system of laws whose source is in the revelation\nof God to humanity. This change leads Albo to dedicate a particularly\nlong discussion (treatise 1, chapters 5\u20138) to the topic of the\nvarious types of law. Albo distinguishes three such types. The first\nof these is divine law, meaning a law whose origin is in divine\nrevelation, such as Judaism. The second type is conventional law, a\nsystem of laws that human beings establish by mutual agreement in\nnumerous political and social frameworks. Its purpose is to maintain\nthe moral order of society and ensure the ongoing function of its\nsystems. The third form of law according to Albo is natural law, or\nthe basic laws of morality that aim to prevent injustice and promote\nhonest behavior. Following is a short explanation of two main aspects\nof Albo\u2019s theory of law that the academic literature covers: the\nconcept of natural law, its origins, meaning and influence; and the\nmethod of verification of divine law.\n\nNatural law. Albo was one of the first Jewish\nphilosophers to specifically address the concept of natural law along\nwith his contemporary Zerahia Halevi Saladin. Apparently, this was due\nto the influence of the Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas, who\nclassified laws in his book Summa Theologica. Albo\u2019s\nview of natural law has attracted the attention of many scholars, in\ncomparison to other topics in his philosophy, but the popular view\namong these scholars is that Albo did not attach great importance to\nthis concept (Guttmann 1955, 176\u2013184; Lerner 1964; Novak 1983,\n319\u2013350; Melamed 1989; Ehrlich 2006; Ackerman 2013).\n\nVerification of divine law. One of the formative\nfactors in Albo\u2019s philosophy was the anti-Christian polemic. For this\nreason, one of the questions that engages him is the method of\ndistinguishing between the true divine law, meaning the Torah of Moses,\nand a false religion that also claims to be of divine origin, meaning\nChristianity. Albo proposes two criteria for distinguishing between the\ntwo. Firstly, the true divine law is the one whose beliefs do not\ncontradict any one of the necessary principles of divine law. Secondly,\nthe true divine law provides incontrovertible proof of the credibility\nof its messenger, who informs the world of the law\u2019s existence and\ndivine origin (treatise 1, chapter 18). An important study on this\nissue argued that the first point is problematic, because it assumes\nthat philosophy defines the basic beliefs of divine law and thus\ndetermines which law is truly divine. This is in opposition to the\nAverroistic approach, which disallows the use of philosophy for\nverifying religious matters. The solution for this problem lies in an\nalternate understanding of the role of philosophy in inter-religious\ndebate. Philosophy does not serve as an affirming mechanism to validate\ncertain beliefs, but only as a negating tool for identifying beliefs\nthat stand in direct conflict with the basic rules of logic. In other\nwords, Albo does not use philosophy to prove the validity of the\nbeliefs of Judaism, but rather to reject Christianity as a false\nreligion in light of its beliefs that stand in contradiction to\nphilosophy (Lasker 1980).\n5.  The Theory of Principles\n\n\nAlbo\u2019s theory of principles is the focal point of his book, the\nframework upon which its sections are built, and the element that\ngrants the book its name. Naturally, the academic debate on the theory\nof principles is also quite extensive. Below we will relate to two\naspects of the theory. First we will present the conceptual structure\nof the theory of principles as detailed in the first treatise of\nSefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim, and then we will survey the various\napproaches of the scholarship on this theory.\n\n\nAlbo presents his theory of principles as an alternative to previous\ntheories of principles, especially that of Maimonides. Additionally,\nAlbo openly criticizes his predecessors\u2019 lists of principles. In their\nstead, he proposes a system of fundamental beliefs divided into three\nlevels, which he calls \u201cprinciples,\u201d \u201croots,\u201d\nand \u201cbranches.\u201d The principles are those beliefs that are\nderived necessarily from the term \u201cdivine law.\u201d They are:\n(1) the existence of the divine entity (\u201cexistence of\nGod\u201d); (2) the divine origin of the system of laws (\u201cTorah\nfrom heaven\u201d); and (3) the existence of divine providence,\nexpressed in compensatory reward and punishment for humanity\n(\u201creward and punishment\u201d). From these principles stem\neight \u201croots,\u201d which are beliefs that instill clear and\ndetailed content into the general concept of the principle.  The first\nprinciple, the existence of God, develops into four roots: (1) the\nunity of God, (2) the incorporeality of God, (3) God\u2019s independence of\ntime, (4) God\u2019s lack of deficiencies. The second principle, Torah from\nheaven, leads to three roots: (5) God\u2019s knowledge, (6) prophecy, and\n(7) the genuineness of the divine messenger. The third principle,\nreward and punishment, branches into a single root: (8)\nprovidence. Denial of any of the principles or roots represents a\nheresy of the divine law.\n\n\nThe third category, \u201cbranches,\u201d comprises beliefs that\nAlbo argues are true and that every follower of divine law must\naccept. But in contrast to the first two categories, Albo does not\ndefine refusal to accept the branches as heresy of the divine law, but\nrather only as a sin requiring atonement. Albo lists six beliefs in\nthis category: (1) creation ex nihilo; (2) the supremacy of\nMoses\u2019 prophecy; (3) the eternal nature of the Torah; (4) the\npossibility of obtaining human perfection through the performance of a\nsingle commandment; (5) the resurrection of the dead; (6) the coming\nof the Messiah.\n\n\nEarly scholars of Albo\u2019s work in the late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth centuries argued that Albo\u2019s contribution to the history of\nJewish thought was limited to his theory of principles and the first\ntreatise of his book (Schlesinger 1844, xi\u2013xiv; Back 1869,\n3\u20135, 8\u20139; T\u00e4nzer 1896, 23\u201330). Later scholars\ncalled his theory unoriginal, and identified the philosophical sources\nthat influenced it, especially Maimonides, Ibn Rushd, Nissim of Gerona,\nHasdai Crescas and Simeon ben Zemah Duran (Guttmann 1955,\n170\u2013176; Waxman 1956, 158\u2013161; Schweid 1963; Klein-Braslavi\n1980, 194\u2013197). A subsequent, third scholarly trend attempted to\nclarify the nature of the internal relationship between the categories\nof Albo\u2019s theory of principles (principles, roots, and branches), and\nexamined Albo\u2019s position regarding the concept of heresy (Kellner 1986,\n140\u2013156).\n6. The Theory of Divinity\n\n\nThe central discussion in the theory of divinity in Sefer\nha-\u2018Ikkarim is located in the second treatise, which is dedicated\nto the principle of the existence of God and its derivative roots. The\nphilosophical issue at the focal point of this discussion is the\ntheory of divine attributes. Scholars of Albo\u2019s theory of attributes\nhave discerned an internal contradiction between rationalist and\nconservative positions in his discussion of this topic. On the one\nhand, in a number of locations he purports to support Maimonides\u2019\nnegative theology, and interprets the various attributes of God as\nnegative attributes. On the other hand, elsewhere he relates positive\nattributes to God, in accordance with the method of his teacher,\nCrescas. Some scholars have ascribed this contradiction to the\neclectic character of Albo\u2019s work (Wolfson 1916\u201317,\n213\u2013216; Guttmann 1955, 184\u2013191), while others have\nrelated it to the esoteric style of writing of Sefer\nha-\u2018Ikkarim.  Possibly, they suggest, his goal here was to\nconceal his conservative position on this issue from the circles of\nrationalist thinkers he frequented (Schwartz 2002, 187\u2013196;\nEhrlich 2009a, 88\u201393).\n\n\nThe second treatise of the book raises another important philosophical\nproblem, the significance of the concept of time. One of the roots of\nthe principle of the existence of God is God\u2019s independence of\ntime. In Albo\u2019s discussion of this root, he discriminates between two\ndifferent concepts of time, Aristotelian-physical and\nNeoplatonic-ontological. Two central trends appear in the academic\nliterature on this topic. The first places the concept of time at the\nfocus of the discussion, attempting to clarify the relationship\nbetween the two different concepts of time that appear in Albo\u2019s\ndiscussion (Harvey 1979\u201380). Those scholars who take the second\nposition discuss Albo\u2019s concept of time as part of their attempt to\nidentify his cosmogonic view, in other words, which theory of the\norigin of the world he upholds (Klein-Braslavi 1976, 118\u2013120,\n126; Rudavsky 1997, 470\u2013473). In this context, we should point\nout that comprehensive study of Albo\u2019s writing on this issue reveals a\ncertain difficulty in categorizing his exact position.  Together with\nexplicit dogmatic statements supporting the theory of creation ex\nnihilo appearing in the first treatise, we find other statements,\nalthough less overt, some of which argue for the eternal existence of\nmatter, and some of which even support the eternal existence of the\nworld (Ehrlich 2009a, 94\u2013112).\n7. The Theory of Humanity\n\n\nThe central discussion on the theory of humanity in Sefer\nha-\u2018Ikkarim is located in the third treatise, which covers\nthe principle of Torah from heaven and its roots. The philosophical\nissue present throughout the sections of this treatise is that of the\nnature of human perfection. To put it mildly, Albo\u2019s discussion on this\ntopic has not merited intensive treatment in the academic literature.\nAside from this concept, the treatise addresses in depth the idea of\nprophecy and several aspects of the Torah of Moses and its\ncommandments. In one section of his discussion on the last topic, Albo\nresponds to the attacks of a Christian scholar on the Torah of Moses,\nincluding both apologetic and polemic elements in his rejoinders.\n\n\nIn the introductory chapters of the third treatise, Albo criticizes\nthe position of the rationalist Jewish philosophers, who associated\nhuman perfection with the level of individual intellectual\nachievement.  In contrast to this approach, Albo proposes a\nconservative theory, arguing that human perfection depends on the\nfulfillment of the Torah\u2019s commandments, in other words, the practical\nworship of God (treatise 3, chapters 1\u20137). Yet on this subject\nas well, we note considerable internal contradictions, which we will\nillustrate with several examples. Firstly, in the first treatise of\nhis book, Albo clearly determines that human perfection depends on\nfaith in God and in the principles of divine law (treatise 1, chapters\n21\u201322). Secondly, in several places in the book he diminishes\nthe value of the practical element of fulfilling the commandments of\nthe Torah, and emphasizes in its stead the element of awareness, or\nintent (treatise 3, chapters 28\u201329). A third contradiction is\nfound in the final chapters of the third treatise, which analyze the\nconcepts of reverence and love for God. Albo considers these to be\nthe highest levels of divine worship. He defines love of God as an\nintellectual phenomenon whose level depends on the intellectual status\nof the person (treatise 3, chapters 35\u201336; Ehrlich\n2004a). According to the two main theories found in the academic\nliterature, these contradictions may characterize either eclectic or\nesoteric writing.\n\n\nTo Albo, prophecy is not a natural characteristic of the human soul,\nbut rather depends on divine will. God, should He so will, grants\ndivine inspiration to the prophet. His primary purpose in so doing is\nto inform humanity of the commandments so that through them they may\nachieve human perfection (treatise 3, chapter 8). Scholars who have\nstudied Albo\u2019s theory of prophecy have pointed out that it integrates\nboth rationalist elements from Maimonides\u2019 parallel discussion and\nspiritual, supra-intellectual elements from the writings of Rabbi\nJudah Halevi and Crescas on this subject. Some have seen in this\nintegration a demonstration of Albo\u2019s purpose in remaining faithful to\nthe Aristotelian tradition of Maimonides, while attempting (not always\nsuccessfully) to bend it as far as possible in the conservative\ndirection (Schweid 1965). Others have considered this integration an\nexpression of the general problematic character of Albo\u2019s thought that\ndoes not contend with the problems it produces. These scholars also\nargue that Albo\u2019s basic approach is that prophecy transcends the\nnatural, and that this concept is grounded in the deep-seated\ntradition of Jewish thought (Kreisel 2001, 540\u2013543). Here as\nwell, we should not ignore the possibility that the internal\ncontradictions in Albo\u2019s discussion reflect an esoteric writing\nstyle.\n\n\nAlbo distinguishes between various levels of prophecy, with the\ncentral goal of establishing the supremacy of Mosaic prophecy as the\nstarting point for validating Mosaic law as the divine law. According\nto Albo, Moses is the most exalted prophet, for only in his case did\ndivine inspiration directly reach the intellectual power of his soul,\nwithout the mediation of the imagination. The significance of this\nproclamation is that only for Moses\u2019 prophecy is there no doubt\nregarding the validity of its content (treatise 3, chapters\n8\u201310). Albo also claims that at the giving of the Torah on Mt.\nSinai, the Israelites all received prophetic inspiration; however, they\nwere not on the prophetic level, and this is in support of Moses\u2019\nadvanced status (treatise 3, chapter 11).\n\n\nAfter discussing the prophecy of Moses, Albo takes up the topic of the\ndivine Torah that Moses gave to the people of Israel. He treats a\nnumber of aspects of this issue, such as the classification of the\nmitzvot (commandments), the status of the Ten Commandments,\nand the importance of the Oral Law. Yet apparently, the thrust of his\nefforts is directed toward establishing the idea of the eternity of\nthe Torah, apparently in response to the Jewish-Christian polemic on\nthis topic. Remaining faithful to his dogmatic method, Albo argues\nthat in Mosaic law, and in divine law in general, changes in the\ndetails of the commandments may take place, but their fundamental\nprinciples cannot change (treatise 3, chapters 13\u201322).\n\n\nWithin his discussion on Mosaic law, Albo includes a chapter\ndescribing its condemnation by an anonymous Christian scholar\n(treatise 3, chapter 25). The Christian contends that in every\npossible parameter, the religion of Jesus supersedes Mosaic law, and\nAlbo replies to this assault in detail. The present forum is too\nlimited to specify the content of this polemic, but suffice it to say\nthat this chapter in particular reflects Albo\u2019s quite extensive\nknowledge of the Christian religion. He demonstrates proficiency in\nChristian writings, and in addition, he recognizes the internal\ntension within Christianity between the papacy and the Roman\nEmpire. He reveals knowledge of Church history, and finally, he\nchallenges the central Christian doctrines (the Trinity,\ntransubstantiation, and the virgin birth) while describing them in\ndetail. It should be noted that Albo\u2019s polemic against Christianity is\nnot limited to this chapter, but runs throughout the book, both\nexplicitly and implicitly (Schweid 1968; Lasker 1977, cf. index\n[\u201cAlbo, Joseph\u201d]; Rauschenbach 2002, 142\u2013156).\n8. The Theory of Providence and Recompense\n\n\nThe fourth and last treatise of Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim is\nprimarily concerned with the principle of reward and punishment and\nits roots. The first part of this treatise (chapters 1\u201328)\ncontains Albo\u2019s central discussion on the theory of providence, while\nthe second part (chapters 29\u201351) incorporates his main\ndiscussion on the theory of recompense. Below we will discuss these\ntwo theories in their order of appearance in the book.\n\n\nAlbo begins this treatise with the statement that humanity has basic\nfree will, for this is the necessary condition of the concept of\nrecompense. Additionally, he argues that this human freedom does not\nconflict with God\u2019s omniscience, nor with the existence of an\nastrological-deterministic system in the universe (treatise 4,\nchapters 1\u20136; Sadik 2012; Weiss 2017). His direct discussion of\nthe concept of divine providence divides into three main parts. First,\nhe discusses the proofs of the veracity of providence from natural and\nhuman reality, and from intellectual investigation (treatise 4,\nchapters 8\u201310). Then he treats the principal theological\nchallenge to the concept of providence, namely, the problem of evil,\nor the suffering of the righteous and success of the wicked (treatise\n4, chapters 12\u201315).  Finally, he examines the specific religious\nconsequences of providence, paying special attention to the\ntheoretical infrastructure of the precepts of prayer (treatise 4,\nchapters 16\u201324) and repentance (treatise 4, chapters\n25\u201328; Ehrlich 2008; Harvey 2015). These last two discussions\nare of exceptional scope within medieval Jewish philosophy.\n\n\nAlbo\u2019s discussions of free will, of proofs for divine providence, and\nof the problem of evil do not include almost any original ideas, and he\nmostly relies on the writings of the Jewish philosophers who preceded\nhim. In contrast, his treatment of prayer and repentance seem to\nreveal a certain level of innovation. Regarding free will, Albo\napparently adopts Maimonides\u2019 opinion that divine knowledge differs\nsignificantly from human knowledge, and that God\u2019s absolute knowledge\ndoes not necessarily abrogate free will for human beings. The academic\nliterature considers several of Albo\u2019s discussions on providence to be\nnothing more than comprehensive summaries of the work of his\nprecursors. This category includes his methods of proving the\nexistence of divine providence over humanity, as well as his attempts\nto defend the concept of God\u2019s absolute good, despite what seems to be\ninjustice in the world (Bleich 1997, 340\u2013358). Still, in the\nrest of the treatise Albo presents broad, methodical discussions on\nthe various philosophical aspects of the issues of prayer and\nrepentance, for which his predecessors addressed mainly the halakhic\nfeatures.\n\n\nAlbo\u2019s central argument on the topic of prayer is that it\ninfluences a person\u2019s status by causing an internal change\nwithin that person.  This change raises the person to a level where he\nreceives constant divine inspiration through God\u2019s\nbenevolence. The basic assumption of this concept is that prayer\ncannot cause any change in God, since such an assumption would detract\nfrom divine perfection. Thus we should conceive of prayer as the\ninternal act of a person upon the self, raising the self to a higher\nspiritual level (treatise 4, chapters 16\u201318). This model stands\nin opposition to the traditional conception of prayer as a channel of\ncommunication between the praying person and the listening God.\n\n\nAlbo understands the significance of repentance in two directions.\nThe first is based on his concept of prayer, and defines repentance as\nan act in which a person uplifts himself to a higher level than at the\ntime of the sin. In this way, he changes his identity, and is no\nlonger deserving of punishment for the act he performed in his\nprevious identity (treatise 4, chapter 18). The second conception of\nrepentance focuses not on the person but on the sinful act he has\ncommitted. Under this rubric, repentance retroactively expropriates\nthe conscious foundations of this act. In other words, repentance\nredefines the sinful act as unintentional, and thus undeserving of\npunishment (treatise 4, chapter 27).\n\n\nThe second half of the fourth treatise of Sefer ha-\u2018Ikkarim\npresents Albo\u2019s theory of recompense. The main issue Albo raises here\nis the character of the reward and punishment destined for a person in\nthe world to come. Throughout his wide-ranging discussion on the\nquestion of recompense in the next world, Albo confronts two\nconflicting points of view. Maimonides views recompense as applying to\nthe soul alone, while Nahmanides opines that it affects the body as\nwell (treatise 4, chapters 29\u201341). Albo\u2019s own opinion on this\nsubject is unclear. At the beginning of the discussion, he seems to\nsupport Maimonides\u2019 viewpoint, but he continues the discussion with\nthe assumption that he cannot definitely rule out Nahmanides\u2019\napproach, which is supported by sources from kabbalistic literature.\nScholars who have discerned the unique character of this section have\ndescribed Albo\u2019s position in almost every possible way. Some say he\navoids commitment (Sarachek 1932, 224), while others think he adopts a\nsynthetic middle position (Schwartz 1997, 202\u2013208); still others\nbelieve he accepts Maimonides\u2019 approach (Husik 1966, 426), and their\nopponents argue that he accepts Nahmanides\u2019 view (Agus 1959,\n238\u2013239). Apparently, therefore, this issue in Albo\u2019s\nphilosophical-religious theory is especially obscure (Ehrlich 2009b).\n",
