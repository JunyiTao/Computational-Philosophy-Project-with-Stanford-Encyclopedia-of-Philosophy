    "main_text": "Descartes and the Cartesians || Descartes on Consciousness\n2.1 Descartes on Consciousness\n\nIn the Geometric Exposition following the second set of replies to the\nMeditations on First Philosophy (1641), Descartes defines\nthought in the following way:\n\n\nThought. I use this term to include everything that is within\nus in such a way that we are immediately aware [conscii] of\nit. Thus all the operations of the will, the intellect, the\nimagination and the senses are thoughts. I say\n\u2018immediately\u2019 so as to exclude the consequences of\nthoughts; a voluntary movement, for example, originates in a thought.\n(CSM II 113 / AT VII 160; cf. Principles of Philosophy Part\nI, \u00a79 / AT VIIIA 7\u20138)\n\n\nHere, in 1641, we have Descartes defining thought in terms of\nconsciousness\u2014a thought is something \u201cin\nus\u201d of which we are conscious. \n\nThere are obvious problems from the start. In what way am I conscious\nof my thoughts? It seems, rather, that I am conscious of\nwhat my thoughts represent. Descartes was well aware of the\ndistinction between a thought and the object of\nthought, and he made use of two technical terms to mark out this\ndistinction. Descartes distinguished between the form of\nthought, which he calls idea:\n\n\nIdea. I understand the term to mean the form of any given\nthought, immediate perception of which makes me aware\n[conscius] of the thought. (CSM II 113 / AT VII 160)\n\n\nNotice the similar reflective aspect of this: it is the perception\nof an idea that makes me conscious of the thought. But the idea\nis simply the form of the thought itself. The object\nof thought is whatever is represented by the thought. And so,\nDescartes defines the \u201cobjective reality of an idea\u201d as\n\u201cthe being of the thing which is represented by an idea insofar\nas it exists in the idea\u2026. For whatever we perceive as being in\nthe objects of our ideas exists objectively <or by\nrepresentation> in the ideas themselves\u201d (CSM II 113 /\nAT VII 160). \n\nAnd so, as a first pass, it seems that consciousness for Descartes\nentails a perception (that has some content) and a second reflective\nact by which I am aware of the first perception. It seems that the\nreflective aspect of consciousness does remain as a part of\nDescartes\u2019s account of consciousness, but we\u2019ll see that\nit\u2019s less clear just what exactly the \u201csecond reflective\nact\u201d is. But it is also the case that Descartes isn\u2019t so\ninterested in an analysis of consciousness as such. We might\nbe looking for an analysis of consciousness; Descartes is not. For\nDescartes, consciousness is taken as given.\n\nTo see the trajectory from earlier theories of mind, it will be\nhelpful simply to see that, in the cogito argument of the\nFirst and Second Meditations, Descartes sees reason to doubt all\nfeatures of his mind other than what is consciously available\nto him. And even then, his conscious thoughts serve only as evidence\nof his own existence\u2014they don\u2019t give any further evidence\nthat what they represent about things external to him either\nexist at all or exist as represented by the idea in his mind. And so\nconsciousness implicitly becomes, for Descartes, the \u201cmark of\nthe mental\u201d and any further development of theories of mind\nalong these lines will have to consider the role of consciousness in\nthe mental economy.\n\nThe role of consciousness, for Descartes, is primarily\nepistemic\u2014it makes certain things available to the mind. Three\nparticular aspects of this come to the fore in the\nMeditations:\n\nTransparency of the Mental: All of my thoughts\nare evident to me (I am aware of all of my thoughts), and my\nthoughts are incorrigible (I can\u2019t be mistaken about\nwhether I have a particular\n thought).[1]\nReflection: Any thought necessarily involves\nknowledge of\n myself.[2]\nIntentionality: My thoughts come to me as\nif representing\n something.[3]\n\n\nEach of these emerge as necessary planks of Descartes\u2019s argument\nin the Meditations. By simply having a thought (e.g.,\n\u201cI am doubting\u201d) I know that I am having a thought and\nthat this necessarily entails that I exist. This inference depends on\nthe transparency of the mental and a reflective act (which Descartes\nfurther emphasizes in the Third Meditation, CSM II 34 / AT VII 49).\nFurther, the intentionality of thought is part of what allows the\nmeditator to infer that he is not alone in the world\u2014he has a\nthought of an infinitely perfect being, and he has other thoughts of\nmaterial objects. From this material\u2014the thoughts and what they\nappear to represent\u2014he is able to infer that God and the\nmaterial world do in fact exist.\n\nDo these three factors provide us with a full analysis of\nconsciousness? Not entirely. But when pressed to defend these three\naspects of the mind, he gives us more material from which we may infer\nan account of consciousness. For example, Antoine Arnauld, in the\nFourth Set of Objections, raises the following problem for\nDescartes:\n\n\nThe author lays it down as certain that there can be nothing in him,\nin so far as he is a thinking thing, of which he is not aware\n[conscius], but it seems to me that this is false. For by\n\u2018himself, in so far as he is a thinking thing,\u2019 he means\nsimply his mind, in so far as it is distinct from his body. But all of\nus can surely see that there may be many things in our mind of which\nthe mind is not aware [conscius]. The mind of an infant in\nits mother\u2019s womb has the power of thought, but is not aware\n[conscius] of it. And there are countless similar examples,\nwhich I will pass over. (CSM II 150 / AT VII 214)\n\n\nArnauld is objecting here to the transparency thesis\u2014there are\ncountless examples, he thinks, of thoughts of which the thinker is not\nconscious (a very interesting admission!). How does Descartes\nrespond?\n\n\nAs to the fact that there can be nothing in the mind, in so far as it\nis a thinking thing, of which it is not aware [conscius],\nthis seems to me to be self-evident. For there is nothing that we can\nunderstand to be in the mind, regarded in this way, that is not a\nthought or dependent on a thought. If it were not a thought or\ndependent on a thought it would not belong to the mind qua\nthinking thing; and we cannot have any thought of which we are not\naware [conscius] at the very moment when it is in us. In view\nof this I do not doubt that the mind begins to think as soon as it is\nimplanted in the body of an infant, and that it is immediately aware\n[conscius] of its thoughts, even though it does not remember\nthis afterwards because the impressions of these thoughts do not\nremain in the memory. (CSM II 171\u2013172 / AT VII 246)\n\n\nThe possible evidence against the transparency thesis, namely, the\nbaby in the womb, does not tell against it, since failing to\nremember having a conscious thought does not entail that one\ndid not have a conscious thought. But this answer, as a\ndefense of the transparency thesis, raises a problem for reflection.\nIf reflection is necessarily involved in consciousness, for Descartes,\nthen is he here granting that even a fetus can reflect?\n\nDescartes appears to resist this in his later correspondence with\nArnauld. Arnauld distinguishes \u201csimple reflection\u201d from\n\u201cexpress reflection,\u201d and argues that although\n\u201csimple reflection\u201d is \u201cintrinsic to all\nthought,\u201d it is distinct from the sort of reflection necessary\nfor intellectual memory and understanding. Descartes responds with his\nown distinction:\n\n\n[W]e make a distinction between direct and reflective thoughts\ncorresponding to the distinction between direct and reflective\nvision\u2026. I call the first and simple thoughts of infants direct\nand not reflective\u2026. But when an adult feels [sentio]\nsomething, and simultaneously perceives that he has not felt it before\n[i.e., it involves intellectual memory], I call this second perception\nreflection, and attribute it to the intellect alone, in spite of its\nbeing so linked to sensation that the two occur together and appear to\nbe indistinguishable from each other. (CSM III 357 / AT V\n220\u2013221)\n\n\nArnauld, however, preserves this distinction in terms of\nreflection. According to Arnauld, \n\n\n[O]ur thought or perception is essentially\nreflective upon itself: or, as it is said rather better in Latin,\nest sui conscia. For I do not think without knowing that I\nthink. I do not know a square without knowing that I know it. (Arnauld\n71)\n\n\nThis reflection that is essential to any thought, however, does not\ninvolve a second order perception. Each thought, according to Arnauld,\nhas reflection built into it\u2014a representation of the\nsubject of thought is an essential part of the content of\neach thought. This is what he calls \u201csimple\u201d or\n\u201cvirtual reflection\u201d to distinguish it from the sort of\nreflection that is a result of the subject focusing her attention on\nsome other thought, which does require a second-order thought\ntaking the lower-order thought as its object. (See Nadler 1989,\n118\u201322 for discussion of this.)\n\nAlthough Descartes resists attributing reflection, even\nsimple reflection, to infants, Arnauld\u2019s distinction is\nin line with Descartes\u2019s response to another of his objectors.\nPierre Bourdin attempts to raise problems for Descartes on the\nsupposition that consciousness requires a distinct reflective\nthought:\n\n\nBy \u201cthinking\u201d you may mean that you understand and will\nand imagine and have sensations, and that you think in such a way that\nyou can contemplate and consider your thought by a reflexive act. This\nwould mean that when you think, you know and consider that you are\nthinking (and this is really what it is to be conscious [conscius\nesse] and to have conscious awareness [conscientia] of\nsome activity). Such consciousness, you claim, is a property of a\nfaculty or thing that is superior to matter and is wholly spiritual,\nand it is in this sense that you are a mind or a spirit. (CSM II 364 /\nAT VII 533\u2013534)\n\n\nDescartes denies this inference:\n\n\nMy critic says that to enable a substance to be superior to matter and\nwholly spiritual\u2026, it is not sufficient for it to think: it is\nfurther required that it should think that it is thinking, by means of\na reflexive act, or that it should have awareness\n[conscientia] of its own thought. This\nis\u2026deluded\u2026. [T]he initial thought by means of which we\nbecome aware [adverto] of something does not differ from the\nsecond thought by means of which we become aware that we were aware of\nit [per quam advertimus nos istud prius advertisse], any more\nthan this second thought differs from the third thought by means of\nwhich we become aware that we were aware that we were aware. (CSM II\n382 / AT VII 559)\n\n\nDescartes does not here deny that reflection is necessary for\nconsciousness. Rather, he is denying that reflection requires a\ndistinct thought. (Note, however, the shift in tense,\n\u201c\u2026we become aware that we were\naware\u2026,\u201d which casts doubt on whether these could be\nidentical thoughts. More on this below.)\n\nAnd so, in response to these objections Descartes gives us some\nrefinements on his account of consciousness. Consciousness, for\nDescartes, is an intrinsic property of all thoughts (even of the\nthoughts of infants) by which the subject becomes aware of the thought\nitself. While this involves reflection, the reflective thought is not\ndistinct from the initial thought itself.\n\nThe adjustments Descartes makes in his claims about consciousness have\nled some scholars to conclude that Descartes doesn\u2019t have a\nsingle account of consciousness. Rather, he is working with multiple\ndistinct notions of consciousness (see Radner 1988,\nL\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki 2007, and Simmons 2012). Whether or not he would\nhave been aware of this is unclear.\n\nSummary. Descartes provides one of the first purely\npsychological uses of the concept of consciousness when he defines\nthought in terms of consciousness. However, he does not provide an\nanalysis of the concept. Rather, he employs the concept in a\nway that grounds his epistemic claims in the Meditations, for\nexample. But the ways in which he employs the concept is suggestive of\nan analysis: a conscious thought is a mental state that is somehow\nself-intimating. And all thoughts, according to Descartes, have this\nbasic property.\n\nThis sketch of an analysis was bequeathed to Descartes\u2019s\ndisciples, who argued over how best to understand consciousness. It is\nclear that Descartes\u2019s project gives a central role to\nconsciousness, but Descartes nowhere gives us an analysis of this\nbasic concept. Is there anything about consciousness as such\nthat allows it to play this central role?\n\n(For more on the topic of consciousness and the related topics of\ntransparency of the mental, representation, and reflection in\nDescartes, see Alanen 2003, Broughton 2008, Hennig 2007,\nL\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki 2007, McRae 1972, Radner 1988, Rozemond 2006,\nSimmons 2012, and Wilson 1978. Interpretations of Descartes\u2019s\naccount of consciousness differ significantly. Hennig, for example,\nargues that Descartes is not in fact using the term\nconscientia in a new way. Simmons, on the other hand, argues\nthat Descartes has the resources for a nuanced account of\nconsciousness, allowing for a wide variety of psychological\nphenomena.)\n",
