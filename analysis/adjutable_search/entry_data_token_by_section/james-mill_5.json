    "main_text": "The Essay on Government || The Meritocratic \u201cMiddle Rank\u201d\n4.2 The Meritocratic \u201cMiddle Rank\u201d\nMill\u2019s view that each individual is the best judge of his own interests appears to stand in stark contrast with his praise and apparent privileging of one particular collectivity\u2014the \u201cmiddle rank, \u2026 that intelligent, that virtuous rank \u2026 which gives to science, to art, and to legislation itself, their most distinguished ornaments, and is the chief source of all that has exalted and refined human nature\u2026\u201d It is to this middle rank\u2014the forerunner of the modern \u201cmeritocracy\u201d\u2014that common laborers look for advice and guidance, especially in moral and political matters (Mill 1992, 41\u201342). Although such remarks have struck many modern commentators as a militant defense of middle class power and privilege, it is, in fact, nothing of the sort. Mill rarely uses the phrase \u201cmiddle class,\u201d preferring instead the more archaic \u201cmiddle rank.\u201d And this, once again, underscores the continuing importance of Mill\u2019s Scottish education. The notion of \u201cranks,\u201d as analyzed at length in John Millar\u2019s Origin of the Distinction of Ranks (1806), had left a deep impression. Millar\u2019s (and Mill\u2019s) \u201cranks\u201d are not (quite) \u201cclasses\u201d in our modern sense\u2014that is, purely descriptive, fairly distinct, and normatively neutral socio-economic entities\u2014but are instead meant to pick out people of particular intellectual merit and to mark gradations of moral and civic influence.\nMill is quite careful to distinguish between a \u201cclass\u201d and a \u201crank.\u201d The members of a \u201cclass\u201d are united by shared (and usually selfish or \u201csinister\u201d) interests. Members of the \u201cmiddle rank,\u201d by contrast, are marked more by their education, intellect, and public-spiritedness than by their wealth or any other social or economic characteristics. They are \u201cuniversally described as both the most wise and the most virtuous part of the community which\u201d\u2014Mill adds acidulously\u2014\u201cis not the Aristocratical [class]\u201d (Mill 1992, 41). Members of the middle rank owe their position not to accident of birth but to \u201cthe present state of education, and the diffusion of knowledge\u201d among those anxious to acquire it. By these lights the \u201cradical tailor\u201d Francis Place, the stockbroker David Ricardo, the wealthy philanthropist Jeremy Bentham, the Quaker editor William Allen, and even James Mill himself\u2014although not all \u201cmiddle class\u201d by modern standards\u2014belonged to the esteemed middle rank. Clearly, then, the idea of a middle rank cuts across the kinds of class divisions with which we are familiar today. Hence any attempt to classify Mill as an apologist for \u201cthe middle-class\u201d simpliciter is anachronistic and rather wide of the mark. He is instead an early defender, avant la lettre, of the idea of a meritocracy whose members are drawn from all classes and walks of life.\n",
