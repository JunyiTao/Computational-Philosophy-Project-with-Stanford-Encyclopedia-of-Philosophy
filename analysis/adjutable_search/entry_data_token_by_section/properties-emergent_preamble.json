    "main_text": "\n\nThe world appears to contain diverse kinds of objects and\nsystems\u2014planets, tornadoes, trees, ant colonies, and human\npersons, to name but a few\u2014characterized by distinctive features\nand behaviors. This casual impression is deepened by the success of\nthe special sciences, with their distinctive taxonomies and laws\ncharacterizing astronomical, meteorological, chemical, botanical,\nbiological, and psychological processes, among others. But\nthere\u2019s a twist, for part of the success of the special sciences\nreflects an effective consensus that the features of the composed\nentities they treat do not \u201cfloat free\u201d of features and\nconfigurations of their components, but are rather in some way(s)\ndependent on them.\n\nConsider, for example, a tornado. At any moment, a tornado depends for\nits existence on dust and debris, and ultimately on whatever\nmicro-entities compose it; and its properties and behaviors likewise\ndepend, one way or another, on the properties and interacting\nbehaviors of its fundamental components. Yet the tornado\u2019s\nidentity does not depend on any specific composing micro-entity or\nconfiguration, and its features and behaviors appear to differ in kind\nfrom those of its most basic constituents, as is reflected in the fact\nthat one can have a rather good understanding of how tornadoes work\nwhile being entirely ignorant of particle physics. The point\ngeneralizes to more complex and longer-lived entities, including\nplants and animals, economies and ecologies, and myriad other\nindividuals and systems studied in the special sciences: such entities\nappear to depend in various important respects on their components,\nwhile nonetheless belonging to distinctive taxonomies and exhibiting\nautonomous properties and behaviors, as reflected in their governing\nspecial science laws. (The point might be generalized yet further to\ninclude human artifacts which are not the object of any natural\nscience, but whose conditions of individuation are tied to human\nlanguage and practice. But artifacts are set aside in this entry, as\nthese raise distinctive issues that are discussed in the entry on\n material constitution.\n Whether there are composites that are neither artifactual nor\namenable to scientific analysis is controversial, and if there are,\nthey plausibly will not meet candidate autonomy conditions on\nemergence. But this will not be explored further here.)\n\nThe general notion of emergence is meant to conjoin these\ntwin characteristics of dependence and autonomy. It mediates between\nextreme forms of dualism, which reject the micro-dependence\nof some entities, and reductionism, which rejects\nmacro-autonomy.\n",
