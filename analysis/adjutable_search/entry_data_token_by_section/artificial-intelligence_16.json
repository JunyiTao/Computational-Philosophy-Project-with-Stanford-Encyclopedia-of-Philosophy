The Future\n\nIf past predictions are any indication, the only thing we know today\nabout tomorrow\u2019s science and technology is that it will be\nradically different than whatever we predict it will be like.\nArguably, in the case of AI, we may also specifically know today that\nprogress will be much slower than what most expect. After all, at the\n1956 kickoff conference (discussed at the start of this entry), Herb\nSimon predicted that thinking machines able to match the human mind\nwere \u201cjust around the corner\u201d (for the relevant quotes and\ninformative discussion, see the first chapter of AIMA). As it\nturned out, the new century would arrive without a single machine able\nto converse at even the toddler level. (Recall that when it comes to\nthe building of machines capable of displaying human-level\nintelligence, Descartes, not Turing, seems today to be the better\nprophet.) Nonetheless, astonishing though it may be, serious thinkers\nin the late 20th century have continued to issue incredibly optimistic\npredictions regarding the progress of AI. For example, Hans Moravec\n(1999), in his Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind,\ninforms us that because the speed of computer hardware doubles every\n18 months (in accordance with Moore\u2019s Law, which has\napparently held in the past), \u201cfourth generation\u201d\nrobots will soon enough exceed humans in all respects, from running\ncompanies to writing novels. These robots, so the story goes, will\nevolve to such lofty cognitive heights that we will stand to them as\nsingle-cell organisms stand to us\n today.[41]\n\n\nMoravec is by no means singularly Pollyannaish: Many others in AI\npredict the same sensational future unfolding on about the same rapid\nschedule. In fact, at the aforementioned AI@50 conference, Jim Moor\nposed the question \u201cWill human-level AI be achieved within the\nnext 50 years?\u201d to five thinkers who attended the original 1956\nconference: John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Oliver Selfridge, Ray\nSolomonoff, and Trenchard Moore. McCarthy and Minsky gave firm,\nunhesitating affirmatives, and Solomonoff seemed to suggest that AI\nprovided the one ray of hope in the face of fact that our species\nseems bent on destroying itself. (Selfridge\u2019s reply was a bit\ncryptic. Moore returned a firm, unambiguous negative, and declared\nthat once his computer is smart enough to interact with him\nconversationally about mathematical problems, he might take this whole\nenterprise more seriously.) It is left to the reader to judge the\naccuracy of such risky predictions as have been given by Moravec,\nMcCarthy, and\n Minsky.[42]\n\n\nThe judgment of the reader in this regard ought to factor in the\nstunning resurgence, very recently, of serious reflection on what is\nknown as \u201cThe Singularity,\u201d (denoted by us simply as\nS) the future point at which artificial intelligence exceeds\nhuman intelligence, whereupon immediately thereafter (as the story\ngoes) the machines make themselves rapidly smarter and smarter and\nsmarter, reaching a superhuman level of intelligence that, stuck as we\nare in the mud of our limited mentation, we can\u2019t fathom. For\nextensive, balanced analysis of S, see Eden et al. (2013).\n\nReaders unfamiliar with the literature on S may be quite\nsurprised to learn the degree to which, among learned folks, this\nhypothetical event is not only taken seriously, but has in fact become\na target for extensive and frequent philosophizing [for a mordant tour\nof the recent thought in question, see Floridi (2015)]. What\narguments support the belief that S is in our future?\nThere are two main arguments at this point: the familiar\nhardware-based one [championed by Moravec, as noted above, and again\nmore recently by Kurzweil (2006)]; and the \u2013 as far as we know\n\u2013 original argument given by mathematician I. J. Good (1965). In\naddition, there is a recent and related doomsayer argument advanced by\nBostrom (2014), which seems to presuppose that S will occur.\nGood\u2019s argument, nicely amplified and adjusted by Chalmers\n(2010), who affirms the tidied-up version of the argument, runs as\nfollows:\n\nPremise 1: There will be AI (created by HI and such that AI\n= HI). \nPremise 2: If there is AI, there will be AI\\(^+\\) (created\nby AI). \nPremise 3: If there is AI\\(^+\\), there will be AI\\(^{++}\\)\n(created by AI\\(^+\\)). \nConclusion: There will be AI\\(^{++}\\) (= S will\noccur). \n\n\nIn this argument, \u2018AI\u2019 is artificial intelligence at the\nlevel of, and created by, human persons, \u2018AI\\(^+\\)\u2019\nartificial intelligence above the level of human persons, and\n\u2018AI\\(^{++}\\)\u2019 super-intelligence constitutive of S.\nThe key process is presumably the creation of one class of\nmachine by another. We have added for convenience \u2018HI\u2019 for\nhuman intelligence; the central idea is then: HI will create AI, the\nlatter at the same level of intelligence as the former; AI will create\nAI\\(^+\\); AI\\(^+\\) will create AI\\(^{++}\\); with the ascension\nproceeding perhaps forever, but at any rate proceeding long enough for\nus to be as ants outstripped by gods. \n\nThe argument certainly appears to be formally valid. Are its three\npremises true? Taking up such a question would fling us far beyond the\nscope of this entry. We point out only that the concept of one class\nof machines creating another, more powerful class of machines is not a\ntransparent one, and neither Good nor Chalmers provides a rigorous\naccount of the concept, which is ripe for philosophical analysis. (As\nto mathematical analysis, some exists, of course. It is for example\nwell-known that a computing machine at level \\(L\\) cannot possibly\ncreate another machine at a higher level \\(L'\\). For instance, a\nlinear-bounded automaton can\u2019t create a Turing machine.)\n\nThe Good-Chalmers argument has a rather clinical air about it; the\nargument doesn\u2019t say anything regarding whether machines in\nthe AI\\(^{++}\\) category will be benign, malicious, or munificent.\nMany others gladly fill this gap with dark, dark pessimism. The\nlocus classicus here is without question a widely read paper by\nBill Joy (2000): \u201cWhy The Future Doesn\u2019t Need Us.\u201d\nJoy believes that the human race is doomed, in no small part because\nit\u2019s busy building smart machines. He writes: \n\n\nThe 21st-century technologies \u2013 genetics, nanotechnology, and\nrobotics (GNR) \u2013 are so powerful that they can spawn whole new\nclasses of accidents and abuses. Most dangerously, for the first time,\nthese accidents and abuses are widely within the reach of individuals\nor small groups. They will not require large facilities or rare raw\nmaterials. Knowledge alone will enable the use of them.\n\nThus we have the possibility not just of weapons of mass destruction\nbut of knowledge-enabled mass destruction (KMD), this destructiveness\nhugely amplified by the power of self-replication. \n\nI think it is no exaggeration to say we are on the cusp of the further\nperfection of extreme evil, an evil whose possibility spreads well\nbeyond that which weapons of mass destruction bequeathed to the\nnation-states, on to a surprising and terrible empowerment of extreme\n individuals.[43]\n\n\n\nPhilosophers would be most interested in arguments for this\nview. What are Joy\u2019s? Well, no small reason for the attention\nlavished on his paper is that, like Raymond Kurzweil (2000), Joy\nrelies heavily on an argument given by none other than the Unabomber\n(Theodore Kaczynski). The idea is that, assuming we succeed in\nbuilding intelligent machines, we will have them do most (if not all)\nwork for us. If we further allow the machines to make decisions for us\n\u2013 even if we retain oversight over the machines \u2013, we will\neventually depend on them to the point where we must simply accept\ntheir decisions. But even if we don\u2019t allow the machines to make\ndecisions, the control of such machines is likely to be held by a\nsmall elite who will view the rest of humanity as unnecessary \u2013\nsince the machines can do any needed work (Joy 2000).\n\nThis isn\u2019t the place to assess this argument. (Having said that,\nthe pattern pushed by the Unabomber and his supporters certainly\nappears to be flatly\n invalid.[44])\n In fact, many readers will doubtless feel that no such place exists\nor will exist, because the reasoning here is amateurish. So then, what\nabout the reasoning of professional philosophers on the matter? \n\nBostrom has recently painted an exceedingly dark picture of a possible\nfuture. He points out that the \u201cfirst superintelligence\u201d\ncould have the capability\n\nto shape the future of Earth-originating life, could easily have\nnon-anthropomorphic final goals, and would likely have instrumental\nreasons to pursue open-ended resource acquisition. If we now reflect\nthat human beings consist of useful resources (such as conveniently\nlocated atoms) and that we depend on many more local resources, we can\nsee that the outcome could easily be one in which humanity quickly\nbecomes extinct. (Bostrom 2014, p. 416)\n\n\n Clearly, the most vulnerable premise in this sort of argument\nis that the \u201cfirst superintelligence\u201d will arrive indeed\narrive. Here perhaps the Good-Chalmers argument provides a basis.\n\n\nSearle (2014) thinks Bostrom\u2019s book is misguided and\nfundamentally mistaken, and that we needn\u2019t worry. His rationale\nis dirt-simple: Machines aren\u2019t conscious; Bostrom is alarmed at\nthe prospect of malicious machines who do us in; a malicious machine\nis by definition a conscious machine; ergo, Bostrom\u2019s argument\ndoesn\u2019t work. Searle writes: \n\nIf the computer can fly airplanes, drive cars, and win at chess, who\ncares if it is totally nonconscious? But if we are worried about a\nmaliciously motivated superintelligence destroying us, then it is\nimportant that the malicious motivation should be real. Without\nconsciousness, there is no possibiity of its being real.\n\n\nThe positively remarkable thing here, it seems to us, is that Searle\nappears to be unaware of the brute fact that most AI engineers are\nperfectly content to build machines on the basis of the AIMA\nview of AI we presented and explained above: the view according to\nwhich machines simply map percepts to actions. On this view, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter whether the machine really has desires;\nwhat matters is whether it acts suitably on the basis of how AI\nscientists engineer formal correlates to desire. An\nautonomous machine with overwhelming destructive power that\nnon-consciously \u201cdecides\u201d to kill doesn\u2019t become\njust a nuisance because genuine, human-level, subjective desire is\nabsent from the machine. If an AI can play the game of chess, and the\ngame of Jeopardy!, it can certainly play the game of war. Just\nas it does little good for a human loser to point out that the\nvictorious machine in a game of chess isn\u2019t conscious, it will\ndo little good for humans being killed by machines to point out that\nthese machines aren\u2019t conscious. (It is interesting to note that\nthe genesis of Joy\u2019s paper was an informal conversation with\nJohn Searle and Raymond Kurzweil. According to Joy, Searle\ndidn\u2019t think there was much to worry about, since he was (and\nis) quite confident that tomorrow\u2019s robots can\u2019t be\n conscious.[45])\n \n\nThere are some things we can safely say about tomorrow.\nCertainly, barring some cataclysmic events (nuclear or biological\nwarfare, global economic depression, a meteorite smashing into Earth,\netc.), we now know that AI will succeed in producing artificial\nanimals. Since even some natural animals (mules, e.g.) can be\neasily trained to work for humans, it stands to reason that artificial\nanimals, designed from scratch with our purposes in mind, will be\ndeployed to work for us. In fact, many jobs currently done by humans\nwill certainly be done by appropriately programmed artificial animals.\nTo pick an arbitrary example, it is difficult to believe that\ncommercial drivers won\u2019t be artificial in the future. (Indeed,\nDaimler is already running commercials in which they tout the ability\nof their automobiles to drive \u201cautonomously,\u201d allowing\nhuman occupants of these vehicles to ignore the road and read.) Other\nexamples would include: cleaners, mail carriers, clerical workers,\nmilitary scouts, surgeons, and pilots. (As to cleaners, probably a\nsignificant number of readers, at this very moment, have robots from\niRobot cleaning the carpets in their homes.) It is hard to see how\nsuch jobs are inseparably bound up with the attributes often taken to\nbe at the core of personhood \u2013 attributes that would be the most\ndifficult for AI to\n replicate.[46]\n\n\nAndy Clark (2003) has another prediction: Humans will gradually\nbecome, at least to an appreciable degree, cyborgs, courtesy of\nartificial limbs and sense organs, and implants. The main driver of\nthis trend will be that while standalone AIs are often desirable, they\nare hard to engineer when the desired level of intelligence is high.\nBut to let humans \u201cpilot\u201d less intelligent machines is a\ngood deal easier, and still very attractive for concrete reasons.\nAnother related prediction is that AI would play the role of a\ncognitive prosthesis for humans (Ford et al. 1997; Hoffman et al.\n2001). The prosthesis view sees AI as a \u201cgreat equalizer\u201d\nthat would lead to less stratification in society, perhaps similar to\nhow the Hindu-Arabic numeral system made arithmetic available to the\nmasses, and to how the Guttenberg press contributed to literacy\nbecoming more universal. \n\nEven if the argument is formally invalid, it leaves us with a question\n\u2013 the cornerstone question about AI and the future: Will AI\nproduce artificial creatures that replicate and exceed human cognition\n(as Kurzweil and Joy believe)? Or is this merely an interesting\nsupposition? \n\nThis is a question not just for scientists and engineers; it is also a\nquestion for philosophers. This is so for two reasons. One, research\nand development designed to validate an affirmative answer must\ninclude philosophy \u2013 for reasons rooted in earlier parts of the\npresent entry. (E.g., philosophy is the place to turn to for robust\nformalisms to model human propositional attitudes in machine terms.)\nTwo, philosophers might well be able to provide arguments that answer\nthe cornerstone question now, definitively. If a version of either of\nthe three arguments against \u201cStrong\u201d AI alluded to above\n(Searle\u2019s CRA; the G\u00f6delian attack; the Dreyfus argument)\nare sound, then of course AI will not manage to produce machines\nhaving the mental powers of persons. No doubt the future holds not\nonly ever-smarter machines, but new arguments pro and con on the\nquestion of whether this progress can reach the human level that\nDescartes declared to be unreachable. \n",
