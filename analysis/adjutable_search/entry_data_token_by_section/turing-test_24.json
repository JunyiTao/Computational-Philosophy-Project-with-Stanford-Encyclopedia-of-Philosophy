    "main_text": "Alternative Tests || The Turing Test is Too Easy\n5.3 The Turing Test is Too Easy\n\nThere are authors who have suggested that The Turing Test should be\nreplaced with a more demanding test of one kind or another. It is not\nat all clear that any of these tests actually proposes a better goal\nfor research in AI than is set by The Turing Test. However, in this\nsection, we shall not attempt to defend that claim; rather, we shall\nsimply describe some of the further tests that have been proposed, and\nmake occasional comments upon them. (One preliminary point upon which\nwe wish to insist is that Turing\u2019s Imitation Game was devised\nagainst the background of the limitations imposed by then current\ntechnology. It is, of course, not essential to the game that tele-text\ndevices be used to prevent direct access to information about the sex\nor genus of participants in the game. We shall not advert to these\nrelatively mundane kinds of considerations in what follows.)\n5.3.1 The Total Turing Test\n\nHarnad (1989, 1991) claims that a better test than The Turing Test\nwill be one that requires responses to all of our inputs, and not\nmerely to text-formatted linguistic inputs. That is, according to\nHarnad, the appropriate goal for research in AI has to be to construct\na robot with something like human sensorimotor capabilities. Harnad\nalso considers the suggestion that it might be an appropriate goal for\nAI to aim for \u201cneuromolecular indistinguishability,\u201d but\nrejects this suggestion on the grounds that once we know how to make a\nrobot that can pass his Total Turing Test, there will be no problems\nabout mind-modeling that remain unsolved. It is an interesting\nquestion whether the test that Harnad proposes sets a more appropriate\ngoal for AI research. In particular, it seems worth noting that it is\nnot clear that there could be a system that was able to pass The\nTuring Test and yet that was not able to pass The Total Turing Test.\nSince Harnad himself seems to think that it is quite likely that\n\u201cfull robotic capacities [are] \u2026 necessary to generate\n\u2026 successful linguistic performance,\u201d it is unclear why\nthere is reason to replace The Turing Test with his extended test.\n(This point against Harnad can be found in Hauser (1993:227), and\nelsewhere.)\n5.3.2 The Lovelace Test\n\nBringsjord et al. (2001) propose that a more satisfactory aim for AI\nis provided by a certain kind of meta-test that they call the Lovelace\nTest. They say that an artificial agent A, designed by human\nH, passes the Lovelace Test just in case three conditions are jointly\nsatisfied: (1) the artificial agent A produces output\nO; (2) A\u2019s outputting O is not the\nresult of a fluke hardware error, but rather the result of processes\nthat A can repeat; and (3) H\u2014or someone who\nknows what H knows and who has H\u2019s\nresources\u2014cannot explain how A produced O by\nappeal to A\u2019s architecture, knowledge-base and core\nfunctions. Against this proposal, it seems worth noting that there are\nquestions to be raised about the interpretation of the third\ncondition. If a computer program is long and complex, then no human\nagent can explain in complete detail how the output was\nproduced. (Why did the computer output 3.16 rather than 3.17?) But if\nwe are allowed to give a highly schematic explanation\u2014the\ncomputer took the input, did some internal processing and then\nproduced an answer\u2014then it seems that it will turn out to be\nvery hard to support the claim that human agents ever do anything\ngenuinely creative. (After all, we too take external input, perform\ninternal processing, and produce outputs.) What is missing from the\naccount that we are considering is any suggestion about the\nappropriate level of explanation that is to be provided. It\nis quite unclear why we should suppose that there is a relevant\ndifference between people and machines at any level of explanation;\nbut, if that\u2019s right, then the test in question is trivial. (One\nmight also worry that the proposed test rules out by fiat the\npossibility that creativity can be best achieved by using genuine\nrandomising devices.)\n5.3.3 The Truly Total Turing Test\n\nSchweizer (1998) claims that a better test than The Turing Test will\nadvert to the evolutionary history of the subjects of the test. When\nwe attribute intelligence to human beings, we rely on an extensive\nhistorical record of the intellectual achievements of human beings. On\nthe basis of this historical record, we are able to claim that human\nbeings are intelligent; and we can rely upon this claim when we\nattribute intelligence to individual human beings on the basis of\ntheir behavior. According to Schweizer, if we are to attribute\nintelligence to machines, we need to be able to advert to a comparable\nhistorical record of cognitive achievements. So, it will only be when\nmachines have developed languages, written scientific treatises,\ncomposed symphonies, invented games, and the like, that we shall be in\na position to attribute intelligence to individual machines on the\nbasis of their behavior. Of course, we can still use The Turing Test\nto determine whether an individual machine is intelligent: but our\nanswer to the question won\u2019t depend merely upon whether or not\nthe machine is successful in The Turing Test; there is the further\n\u201cevolutionary\u201d condition that also must be satisfied.\nAgainst Schweizer, it seems worth noting that it is not at all clear\nthat our reason for granting intelligence to other humans on the basis\nof their behavior is that we have prior knowledge of the collective\ncognitive achievements of human beings.\n\n5.3.4 Further Proposals\n\nDamassino (2020) suggests that it would be better to require test\nsubjects to produce an enquiry in which performance is assessed along\nthree dimensions: (a) comparison with human performance; (b) success\nin completing the enquiry; and (c) efficiency in completing the\nenquiry (minimisation of the number of questions asked in completing\nthe enquiry). The motivation given for this proposal is that, because\nThe Turing Test attracts projects whose primary ambition is to fool\njudges, it is concerned with whether or how well test subjects perform\non their allocated tasks. It seems to us that there is nothing here\nthat impugns The Turing Test. It does not count against The\nTuring Test that public competitions based on it with prizes\nattached lead to gaming, given that everyone knows that those prizes\nare being awarded to entries that clearly do not pass The Turing Test.\nIf anything is impugned here, it is the public competitions, rather\nthan The Turing Test.\n\nKulikov (2020) suggests that there is value in considering\nPreferential Engagement Tests or Meaningful Engagement Tests. Even\nthough computers can now beat the best humans at chess, many people\nprefer to play chess with humans rather than with expert chess-playing\ncomputers. Perhaps, even if computers could pass The Turing Test,\npeople would prefer to carry on conversations with humans rather than\nwith expert conversational computers. We think that this kind of\nspeculation relies upon assumptions about what could make for expert\nconversational partners. If our conversational partners need to be\nable to update information about their surroundings in real\ntime\u2014for example, while watching a game of football\u2014then\nwe will not think that there is a direct path from GPT-3 to expert\nconversational partners. If only androids can be expert conversational\npartners, then it is less clear that Preferential Engagement Tests or\nMeaningful Engagement Tests will track anything other than\nanthropocentric bias.\n",
