    "main_text": "Historicist Conceptions of Rationality: The Battle of the Big Systems || Evolutionary Models of Scientific Development\n1.6 Evolutionary Models of Scientific Development\n\nToulmin (1972) produced an evolutionary model of scientific\ndevelopment in terms of populations of concepts, a gradualist account\nof scientific change that he considered more historically accurate and\nphilosophically defensible than Kuhn\u2019s discontinuous model.\nToulmin\u2019s \u201cconcepts\u201d are historically malleable, yet they are\ncharacterized by historicity. He quotes Kierkegaard: \u201cConcepts,\nlike individuals, have their histories, and are just as incapable of\nwithstanding the ravages of time as are individuals\u201d (1972:\nfrontispiece). Toulmin held that biological, social, and conceptual\nevolution, including scientific development, are all instances of the\nsame generalized variation-selection-transmission schema, albeit with\nquite different concrete implementations. For Toulmin, disciplines\n(specialties) are analogous to biological species. He touted his model\nas naturalistic, indeed ecological, but not in a way that excludes\nrationality. Rationality enters primarily at the selection level,\ndetermining which families of concepts (including methodological ones)\nget selected and reproduced. Rationality is not a matter of\n\u201clogicality\u201d, i.e., of sticking to a given logical or\nKuhnian framework through thick and thin. Rather, it is a matter of\nadapting appropriately to changing circumstances. Like Newtonian\nforce, rationality has to do with change, not maintenance of the same\nstate. Thus no Kuhnian revolution is needed in order to break out of\nan old conceptual framework.\n\nAs for the descriptive-normative problem, thinkers from Kuhn to Robert\nBrandom (e.g., 2002: 13, 230ff) have appealed to the common law\ntradition as an instructive analogy, and Toulmin was no exception.\nPublished legal cases provide legal precedents that later legal\nargumentation can cite for support. Over time, normative traditions\nemerge. Explicit rules may be formulated by reflecting on the history\nof precedents, but the practices typically remain implicit. There is a\nwhiff of Hegelian, retrospective reconstruction in this idea of\nextracting norms from patterned historical practices that embody them\nimplicitly and contingently. The main trouble with Toulmin\u2019s\naccount, said critics, is that it is so vague and abstract that it\ntells us little about how science works. It would seem to apply to\njust about everything.\n\nDonald Campbell (1960, 1974) had previously defended the generalized\nvariation plus selective retention schema, which he traced back to\nWilliam James. Popper regarded his own evolutionary account of\nscientific development as similar to Campbell\u2019s (1974). Ditto\nfor David Hull (1988) with his more detailed evolutionary model.\nHowever, Hull rejected evolutionary epistemology, as such,\nand denied that he was doing epistemology at all. (Evolutionary\nepistemologies face the problem of why we should expect a contingent\nselectionist process to be truth-conducive: see the entry on\n evolutionary epistemology.\n Assuming that it is can also tempt one to fall into whiggism\nregarding the past in a social Darwinist sort of way.) Hull rejected\nToulmin\u2019s biological species analogy, as based only on\nfeature-similarity rather than on the historical-causal continuity of\ngenuine biological species. Hull\u2019s book reflected his own deep\ninvolvement in the controversy between cladists, evolutionary\nsystematicists, and pheneticists over biological classification. (He\nserved terms as president of both the Society for Systematic Biology\nand the Philosophy of Science Association.) Hull generalized his\nimportant biological concepts of replicator (gene) and interactor\n(organism) to scientists and communities. His central unit of and for\nanalysis was the deme, or research group, in its competition with\nothers.\n\nHull (1988) argued that the success of science can be explained by an\ninvisible hand mechanism rather than in terms of rational\ndecision-making. He did not deny that most scientists regard\nthemselves as rational truth seekers, but on his account the primary\nmotivation is the drive for professional recognition and credit via\npositive citation by others, and avoidance of violations of\ninstitutionalized standards. The term \u2018rationality\u2019 does\nnot even appear in the book\u2019s index. Nonetheless, the\ninstitutional incentive structure of science works to produce\ngenerally reliable results and scientific progress, so that, to\nrationality-minded philosophers, science looks as if it is\ndriven by the intentional rationality of its practitioners. We might\nsay that, for Hull, rationality explains nothing without causal\nbacking, but once we bring the causal mechanisms into play, there is\nno longer a need to foreground rationality, at least not intentional\nrationality.\n\n\nThe better [scientists] are at evaluating the work of others when it\nis relevant to their own research, the more successful they will be.\nThe mechanism that has evolved in science that is responsible for its\nunbelievable success may not be all that \u201crational\u201d, but\nit is effective, and it has the same effect that advocates of science\nas a totally rational enterprise prefer. (1988: 4)\n\n\nLike Adam Smith\u2019s view of the invisible hand regarding altruism\nand the public good, rationalists can interpret Hull\u2019s account\nas broadly Hegelian in the sense that the rationality of science\nemerges (insofar as it does) from the complex social interactions of scientists\nand groups of scientists going about their normal business in ordinary\nways that satisfy community norms and incentive structures, not from\ntheir explicit intentions to make rational decisions. While Hull gave\nclose attention to these social interactions and to the institutions\nthat enable them, he claimed that his appeal to social factors was\ninternal to science rather than external.\n",
