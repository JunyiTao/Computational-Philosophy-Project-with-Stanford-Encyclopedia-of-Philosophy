    "main_text": "Cultural Property || The Problem of Cultural Continuity\n2.3 The Problem of Cultural Continuity\n\nIf cultural property belongs to a cultural group, then this seems to\nrequire some grasp on who constitute the members of the group (Young\n2007: 112). However, defining cultural group membership is a\nnotoriously difficult task (Killmister 2011). For one, it confronts\nproblems concerning cultural essentialism (discussed in\n section 4.2.3\n below). But moreover (and relatedly), it presents questions\nconcerning cultural continuity over time (Appiah 2006: 119). On what\nbasis, for instance, can the contemporary nation of Egypt claim the\nart and cultural artifacts of ancient Egypt as their cultural\nproperty, given the profound cultural differences between contemporary\nand ancient Egyptians? The same question can be raised for many of the\ncultural property claims made by contemporary nations. However,\nalthough there may not be strict cultural identity (in the sense of\nsameness) between cultural groups over time, due in part to the\ndynamic nature of culture, one might question why this kind of strict\nidentity should be thought so important. For instance, we might\ninstead appeal to cultural lineages, analogous to the links of\npsychological connectedness that some think can secure a relevant\nunderstanding of personal identity over time (Parfit 1984; entry on\n personal identity).\n For instance, an overlapping chain of practices, traditions, norms,\nand beliefs could be used to justify the claim that a culture at\nt1 is \u201cthe same culture\u201d as the culture at\nt0, even if it has undergone significant changes. Indeed, one\nmight think that a degree of change is in fact essential for the\npreservation of cultural identity over time (Coleman 2006: 167).\nGranted, this may lead to a plurality of cultural descendants that\nwould make cultural property claims difficult to adjudicate in\npractice, but it is worth noting that the assumption in favor of a\nstrong understanding of cultural identity over time as a necessary\ncondition for cultural property remains largely undefended in the\nliterature.\n\nThat being said, there are additional moral objections to nations in\nparticular making cultural property claims. Nations need not be\nculturally homogeneous, and thus nationalist cultural property claims\nmight objectionably run roughshod over strong intra-national cultural\nproperty claims, for instance, those made by colonized indigenous\ncultural groups (Thompson 2003: 252; Watkins 2005). From the opposite\ndirection, one might worry about how nationalist cultural property\nclaims would restrict the exchange of cultural property around the\nworld, an objectionable consequence if one embraces the influential\nidea (mentioned in\n 2.2\n above) that cultural property has value for all of humanity (Merryman\n1986, 1994).\n\nMoreover, there is a worry that the competing natures of\n\u201cculture\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d generate a\nparadoxical relationship when they are combined in the purported\nconcept of cultural property.\n\n\nProperty is fixed, possessed, controlled by its owner, and alienable.\nCulture is none of these things. Thus cultural property claims tend to\nfix culture, which if anything is unfixed, dynamic, and unstable.\n(Mezey 2007: 2005)\n\n\nSo, not only does the dynamic nature of culture raise metaphysical and\nepistemological questions about the grounds for cultural property\nclaims, it is moreover inherently at odds with the bonds and\nboundaries with which the concept of property attempts to saddle it.\nThus, cultural property tends to offer a version of fixed cultures\nattached to bounded groups that is more amenable to the concept of\nproperty, but consequently offers a distorted and \u201canemic\u201d\npicture of culture (Mezey 2007: 2005\u20136).\n\nOne way to resolve the paradox is to challenge the interpretations of\nthe core concepts that appear to set them at odds. For instance, one\nmight argue that the paradox is generated by reading property in a\nstrict \u201cownership\u201d sense that prioritizes rights of\nexcludability (the right to prevent others from use and access) and\nalienability (the right to transfer property); see entry on\n property and ownership).\n In contrast, an analysis of property in terms of\n\u201cstewardship\u201d, which recognizes a broader range of rights\nand responsibilities for non-title holders, may relax the perceived\nemphasis on property as fixed and bounded, allowing for an\nunderstanding of property that could plausibly avoid the same tensions\nwith the dynamic nature of culture (Carpenter, Katyal, & Riley\n2009: 1022).\n",
