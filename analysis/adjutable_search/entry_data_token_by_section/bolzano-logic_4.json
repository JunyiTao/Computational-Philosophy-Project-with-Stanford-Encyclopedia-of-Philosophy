    "main_text": "Ideas\n4. Ideas\n\nAs mentioned above, Bolzano defines an idea as a part of a\nproposition, more precisely, as \u201cany constituent of a\nproposition that is not itself a proposition\u201d (TS,\n\u00a7128, no. 2 [II.18]; cf. \u00a748). For example, assuming the\nsentence \u2018Fido, who is a dog, is not a reptile\u2019 to be a\nfairly distinct expression of the corresponding proposition, we might\ndistinguish within that proposition ideas (i.e., sub-propositional\nparts) such as [Fido], [dog], [reptile], but also [who], [is], and\n[not]. As with propositions, Bolzano carefully distinguishes between\nideas in themselves, thought (or subjective) ideas, and linguistic\nsigns for ideas.\n\nBolzano\u2019s term is \u2018Vorstellung\u2019. This was\nthe standard rendering of \u2018idea\u2019 in German translations of\nLocke, Hume, et al. It is also sometimes rendered as\n\u2018presentation\u2019 or \u2018representation\u2019, e.g., in\ntranslations of the works of Kant and Husserl. Bolzano\u2019s\ndecision to continue to use the term tends to obscure the vast\ndifferences between his views and those he found in the logical\nliterature of his time. Ideas, for him, are akin to Husserl\u2019s\npart-meanings or to Fregean senses other than thoughts. This is not at\nall what most of the authors Bolzano discussed meant when they spoke\nof ideas, even if there was a tiny point of contact in the\ncircumstance that, like him, those authors usually maintained that\nideas (or notions, concepts, cognitions) could occur as parts of\njudgments, namely, as their subjects and predicates.\n\nBolzano recognizes three individuating features of ideas with objects\n: extension, content, and structure. Loosely\nspeaking, the extension of an idea is \u201cthe collection of all the\nobjects standing under it\u201d (Bolzano 2004a: 46); more strictly,\nit is \u201cthat particular attribute of an idea by virtue of which\nit represents only those and no other objects.\u201d (TS,\n\u00a766, I:298). While ideas with different extensions, for example,\n[prime number] and [odd number], are perforce different on\nBolzano\u2019s account, this is only a sufficient condition, witness\nthe coextensive but clearly different ideas [even prime number] and\n[positive square root of 4].\n\nThough these ideas are coextensive, we can still distinguish them by\nnoting that they have different parts, e.g., that [prime] occurs in\nthe first, but not in the second. Bolzano will say in such cases that\nthe content of the two ideas is different. According to his\ndefinition, the content of a complex idea is the sum of its\nparts. \u2018Sum\u2019 is a technical term in Bolzano\u2019s\nontology, designating collections \u201cin which the manner of\ncombination does not matter and in which the parts of the parts may be\nconsidered parts of the whole\u201d (TS, \u00a784). For our\npurposes, it is sufficient to note that when Bolzano asks us to think\nabout the content of an idea, he wants us to consider its parts, but\nnot their arrangement.\n\nTo resume: ideas with different content also differ. Once again,\nhowever, this condition is merely sufficient, as the same parts can be\narranged differently, witness: [ignorant son of a learned father],\n[learned son of an ignorant father]. Accordingly, Bolzano recognizes\nthe structure of a complex idea, the way its parts are\ncombined (their Verbindungsart), as an additional\nindividuating attribute. Indeed, sometimes structure is the only\nindividuating attribute, as Bolzano shows in TS (\u00a796,\nno. 2) with the clever example of [\\(2^{4}\\)] and [\\(4^{2}\\)], which\nhave the same content and the same extension but differ\nnonetheless.\n\nAlthough in many cases ideas are assumed to be structured like\nlinguistic expressions, it is also clear that Bolzano recognized ideas\nwhose structure cannot be captured in a linear script. For example, in\nideas of the form \u2018\\(A\\), which has the properties \\(b, b',\nb'',\\ldots\\)\u2019, no ordering is supposed between the parts \\(b,\nb', b'',\\ldots\\), which occur in the idea in itself as a unordered\ncollection (Menge).\n\nBolzano was a semantic atomist: in his view, all ideas are ultimately\ncomposed of simple parts, which are themselves ideas (TS,\n\u00a761). In the case of simple ideas with objects, there is no\ncontent strictly speaking since there are no parts, and hence no\nstructure either. Thus such ideas are individuated by their extensions\nalone (TS, \u00a793, no. 3). The relation of a simple idea to\nits objects is primitive, hence undefinable. It is instructive to\ncompare this position with the contemporary practice of interpreting a\nformal language by assigning extensions (objects or sets of objects)\nto the non-logical constants (or parameters).\n\nBolzano does not tell us how simple ideas without objects (e.g.,\n[and], [not]) are individuated. This strikes us as a significant\noversight.\n",
