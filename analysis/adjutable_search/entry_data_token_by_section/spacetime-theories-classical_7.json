    "main_text": "Newton || Absolute Space and Motion\n4.2 Absolute Space and Motion\n\nIn our discussion of Descartes we called the sense of motion operative\nin the science of mechanics \u2018true motion\u2019, and the phrase\nis used in this way by Newton in the Scholium. Thus\nNewton\u2019s bucket shows that true (rotational) motion is\nanti-correlated with, and so not identical with, proper motion (as\nDescartes proposed according to the Garber reading); and Newton\nfurther argues that the rate of true (rotational) motion is unique,\nand so not identical with change of place, which is multiple. Newton\nproposed instead that true motion is motion relative to a temporally\nenduring, rigid, 3-dimensional Euclidean space, which he dubbed\n\u2018absolute space\u2019. Of course, Descartes also defined motion\nas relative to an enduring 3-dimensional Euclidean space; the\ndifference is that Descartes\u2019 space was divided into parts (his\nspace was identical with a plenum of corpuscles) in motion, not a\nrigid structure in which (mobile) material bodies are\nembedded. So according to Newton, the rate of true rotation of the\nbucket (and water) is the rate at which it rotates relative to\nabsolute space. Or put another way, Newton effectively defines the\n1-place predicate x moves-absolutely as x\nmoves-relative-to absolute space; both Newton and Descartes offer\ncompeting 1-place predicates as analyses of x\nmoves-truly.\n4.2.1 Absolute Space vs. Galilean Relativity\n\nNewton\u2019s proposal for understanding motion solves the problems\nthat he posed for Descartes, and provides an interpretation of the\nconcepts of constant motion and acceleration that appear in his laws\nof motion. However, it suffers from two notable interpretational\nproblems, both of which were pressed forcefully by Leibniz (in the\nLeibniz-Clarke Correspondence, 1715\u20131716) \u2013 which is not\nto say that Leibniz himself offered a superior account of motion (see\n below).[5]\n First, according to this account, absolute velocity is a well-defined\nquantity: more simply, the absolute speed of a body is the rate of\nchange of its position relative to an arbitrary point of absolute\nspace. But the Galilean relativity of Newton\u2019s laws (see the\nentry on\n space and time: inertial frames)\n means that the evolution of a closed system would have been identical\nif it had been moving at a different (constant) overall velocity: as\nGalileo noted in his (see the entry on\n Galileo Galilei),\n an experimenter cannot determine from observations inside his cabin\nwhether his ship is at rest in harbor or sailing smoothly. Put another\nway, according to Newtonian mechanics, in principle Newton\u2019s\nabsolute velocity cannot be experimentally determined.\n\nSo in this regard absolute velocity is quite unlike acceleration\n(including rotation). Newtonian acceleration is understood in absolute\nspace as the rate of change of absolute velocity, and is, according to\nNewtonian mechanics, generally measurable; for instance by measuring\nthe height that the water ascends the sides of the\n bucket.[6]\n Leibniz argued (rather inconsistently, as we shall see) that since\ndifferences in absolute velocity are unobservable, they are not be\ngenuine differences at all; and hence that Newton\u2019s absolute\nspace, whose existence would entail the reality of such differences,\nmust also be a fiction. Few philosophers today would immediately\nreject a quantity as unreal simply because it was not experimentally\ndeterminable, but this fact does justify genuine doubts about the\nreality of absolute velocity, and hence of absolute space.\n4.2.2 The Ontology of Absolute Space\n\nThe second problem concerns the nature of absolute space. Newton quite\nclearly distinguished his account from Descartes\u2019 \u2013 in\nparticular with regards to absolute space\u2019s rigidity versus\nDescartes\u2019 \u2018hydrodynamical\u2019 space, and the\npossibility of the vacuum in absolute space. Thus absolute space is\ndefinitely not material. On the other hand, presumably it is supposed\nto be part of the physical, not mental, realm. In De\nGravitatione, Newton rejected both the traditional philosophical\ncategories of substance and attribute as suitable characterizations.\nAbsolute space is not a substance for it lacks causal powers and does\nnot have a fully independent existence, and yet it is not an attribute\nsince it would exist even in a vacuum, which by definition is a place\nwhere there are no bodies in which it might inhere. Newton proposes\nthat space is what we might call a \u2018pseudo-substance\u2019,\nmore like a substance than property, yet not quite a\n substance.[7]\n In fact, Newton accepted the principle that everything that exists,\nexists somewhere \u2013 i.e., in absolute space. Thus he viewed\nabsolute space as a necessary consequence of the existence of\nanything, and of God\u2019s existence in particular \u2013 hence\nspace\u2019s ontological dependence. Leibniz was presumably unaware\nof the unpublished De Gravitatione in which these particular\nideas were developed, but as we shall see, his later works are\ncharacterized by a robust rejection of any notion of space as a real\nthing rather than an ideal, purely mental entity. This is a view that\nattracts even fewer contemporary adherents, but there is something\ndeeply peculiar about a non-material but physical entity, a worry that\nhas influenced many philosophical opponents of absolute\n space.[8]\n",
