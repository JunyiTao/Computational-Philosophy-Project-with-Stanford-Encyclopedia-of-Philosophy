    "main_text": "Deontological Pacifism || Killing Noncombatants\n4.2 Killing Noncombatants\n\nAlthough some maximal versions of deontological pacifism will claim\nthat it is wrong even to kill combatants in war, other versions will\nargue that war is wrong primarily because of the risk to\nnoncombatants. A cherished principle of the just war tradition is the\nidea of noncombatant immunity. This idea holds that those not actually\nengaged in the fighting should not be put at risk and should not be\ndeliberately targeted. This idea is often connected to the idea that\nthe innocent should not be killed. Noncombatants are presumed to be\ninnocent and thus immune from being killed. There is an open question\nas to whether all noncombatants are really innocent. But the just war\ntradition stipulates that noncombatants should be immune from\nintentional harm. A version of pacifism can thus be derived from this\nprinciple of the just war tradition by arguing against wars that do in\nfact end up killing innocent noncombatants. Just war pacifists will\nargue that this is especially true given the nature of modern warfare,\nwhich includes the use of mechanized weapons, aerial bombardment, and\nweapons of mass destruction. Such weaponry does not adequately\ndiscriminate between combatants and noncombatants. Thus modern war\ncannot be just, according to the pacifist interpretation of the just\nwar tradition.\n\nThe just war tradition, however, allows that innocent noncombatants\nmay be killed according to the principle of double effect. This idea\nis derived in the Christian tradition from Aquinas, who holds that a\nsingle act may have two effects. Aquinas uses an example of killing in\nself-defense: the act has one effect of saving a life but another\neffect of killing the aggressor. Killing an aggressor in self-defense\nmay be permitted, if the death of the aggressor is not the primary\nintention of the defensive act. It is significant that Aquinas does\nnot expand this discussion to make it permissible to kill an innocent\nthird party. But the just war tradition has employed this idea in a\nway that makes it permissible to kill innocent third parties (i.e.,\nnoncombatants) in war, so long as the primary intention is to\naccomplish a legitimate war aim and so long as the killing of\ninnocents is merely a foreseen but unintended secondary effect.\nAbsolute pacifists will argue against this employment of the doctrine\nof double effect and will claim that the killing of the innocent in\nwar is always wrong, even if it is an unintended effect.\n\nIndeed, some pacifists may also claim that since we know that war will\nkill noncombatants, it is disingenuous to claim that the deaths of\ninnocent noncombatants are not intended. The pacifist may claim that\nthe real problem of war is that noncombatants are killed intentionally\nas a means of warfare. Although Anscombe argued against pacifism, she\nmade a similar argument in her criticism of the attacks on Hiroshima\nand Nagasaki, \u201cit is nonsense to pretend that you do not intend\nto do what is the means you take to your chosen end\u201d (1981a).\nAnscombe thought that war could be justified\u2014if it did not\ndirectly intend to kill noncombatants. And Anscombe thought that\npacifists were wrong to ignore the distinction between shedding\ninnocent blood and shedding blood in just warfare. But pacifists might\nargue in response that war is wrong because innocent noncombatants are\nkilled\u2014whether intentionally or not.\n",
