    "main_text": "Connexive logics and consequential logics\n5. Connexive logics and consequential logics\n\nAristotle\u2019s and Boethius\u2019 theses express, as it seems,\nsome pre-theoretical intuitions about meaning relations between\nnegation and implication. But it is not clear that a language must\ncontain only one negation operation and only one implication. The\nlanguage of bi-intuitionistic logic contains two negations, the\nlanguage of the bi-intuitionistic connexive logics in Wansing 2016b\nand Kamide & Wansing 2016 contain three negations, and the\nlanguage of systems of consequential implication comprises\ntwo implication connectives together with one negation, see Pizzi\n1977, 1991, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2018, Pizzi and\nWilliamson 1997, 2005. Pizzi (2008, p. 127) considers a notion of\nconsequential relevance, namely that \u201c[t]he antecedent\nand the consequent of a true conditional cannot have incompatible\nmodal status,\u201d and suggests to capture consequential relevance\nby requiring that in any true conditional A \u2192\nB, (i) A strictly implies B and (ii)\nA and B have the same modal status in the sense that\n\u25a1A \u2283 \u25a1B, \u25a1B \u2283\n\u25a1A, \u25caA \u2283 \u25caB, and\n\u25caB \u2283 \u25caA are ture, where \u2283 is\nmaterial implication. Moreover, it is required that \u25a1A\n\u2283 \u25caA is always true.\n\nIn Pizzi and Williamson 1997, a conditional satisfying (i) and (ii) is\ncalled an analytic consequential implication and the notion\nof a normal system of analytic consequential implication is defined.\n\u2018Normal\u2019 here means that such a system contains certain\nformulas and is closed under certain rules. The smallest normal\nconsequential logic that satisfies AT is called CI.\nAlternatively, CI can be characterized as the\nsmallest normal system that satisfies the Weak Boethius\u2019 Thesis,\ni.e, (A \u2192 B) \u2283 \u00ac(A \u2192\n\u00acB), where \u2192 is consequential implication and \u00ac\nis classical negation. In Omori and Wansing 2019 the semantics of\nCI is presented in a way showing that the semantics\nof the consequential conditional is obtained by tweaking the truth\nconditions of strict implication in Kripke models with a serial\naccessibility relation (so that \u25a1A \u2283\n\u25caA is valid). The standard truth conditions are\nsupplemented by requiring equal modal status for the antecedent and\nthe consequent.\n\nPizzi and Williamson (1997) show that CI can be\nfaithfully embedded into the normal modal logic KD,\nand vice versa. Analytic consequential implication is interpreted\naccording to the following translation function \u03c6:\n\n\u03c6(A \u2192 B) = \u25a1(\u03c6A \u2283\n\u03c6B) \u2227 (\u25a1\u03c6B \u2283\n\u25a1\u03c6A) \u2227 (\u25ca\u03c6B \u2283\n\u25ca\u03c6A)\n\n\nAs Pizzi and Williamson (1997, p. 571) point out, their investigation\nis a \u201ccontribution to the modal treatment of logics intermediate\nbetween logics of consequential implication and connexive\nlogics.\u201d They emphasize a difficulty of regarding consequential\nimplication as a genuine implication connective by showing that in any\nnormal system of consequential logic that admits modus ponens for\nconsequential implication and contains BT, the following formulas are\nprovable:\n\n(a) (A \u2192 B) \u2261 (B \u2192\nA),\n\n(b) (A \u2192 B) \u2261 \u00ac(A \u2192\n\u00acB)\n\n\nwhere \u2261 is classical equivalence. Since (A \u2192\nB) \u2194 ~(A \u2192 ~B) is a theorem of\nC and other connexive logics, the more problematic\nfact, from the point of view of this system, is the provability of\n(a). Pizzi and Williamson also show that in any normal system of\nconsequential logic that contains BT, the formula (A \u2192\nB) \u2261 (A \u2261 B) is provable if\n(A \u2192 B) \u2283 (A \u2283 B) is\nprovable, in other words, consequential implication collapses into\nclassical equivalence if (A \u2192 B) \u2283\n(A \u2283 B) is provable. The construction of\nAristotelian squares of opposition and their combination to\nAristotelian cubes in systems of consequential implication is\nconsidered in Pizzi 2008. Two kinds of consequential implication are\ndiscussed and compared to each other in Pizzi 2018.\n",
