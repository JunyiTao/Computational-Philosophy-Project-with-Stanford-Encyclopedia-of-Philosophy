    "main_text": "Causation and Quantum Mechanics\n7. Causation and Quantum Mechanics\n\nIt is often argued that quantum mechanics is particularly inhospitable\nto causal notions. Early discussions of a putative tension between\ncausal notions and quantum mechanics focused mainly on the\nindeterminism of quantum mechanics. More recent discussions by\ncontrast, focus on the problem that nonlocal quantum correlations\nviolate Bell inequalities as presenting a challenge to causal\nanalyses. In a standard setup of a Bell-type experiment one considers\ntwo observers who perform experiments in two spatially separated\nlaboratories on two entangled subsystems. The two experiments are\nperformed independently but can have outcomes that can be correlated\nin ways that are not readily accounted for by classical causal models.\nThere are different strategies for deriving Bell inequalities.\nParticularly helpful analyses for the status of various causal\nassumptions are developed in Wiseman and Cavalcanti (2017) and Wood\nand Spekkens (2015), who examine how to apply Pearl\u2019s structural\ncausal models to Bell experiments (Myrvold, Genovese, & Shimony\n2019). Simplifying somewhat, Wiseman and Cavalcanti assume that Bell\nexperiments take place in Minkowski spacetime and have real outcomes\nthat are not relative to anything. They then show that the quantum\ncorrelations predicted for Bell experiments conflict with the\nconjunction of three postulates: relativistic causality,\naccording to which an event\u2019s causal past is its past lightcone;\nfree choice, which states that measurement settings can be\nfreely chosen and, hence, have no causes within the system under\nconsideration; and Reichenbach\u2019s principle of a common\ncause, according to which correlations among events that are not\nrelated as cause and effect are explained by a common cause in their\njoint past that screens off the correlation.\n\nIf we want to accept the quantum mechanical predictions, which appear\nto be empirically well-confirmed, we have to reject at least one of\nthe postulates. Rejecting free choice amounts to accepting\nsuperdeterminism, according to which measurement settings cannot be\nfreely chosen. Alternatively, we can give up relativistic\ncausality, either by allowing for superluminal influences from\nthe outcomes at one wing on that at the other wing, or by positing\nretro-causal relations, which allow measurement outcomes to influence\nthe earlier state of the source (see, e.g., Price 2012; and references\nin Friederich & Evans 2019).\n\nWhile these strategies allow us to retain Reichenbach\u2019s\nprinciple that correlations among non-causally related events are\nexplained by a common cause that screens off these correlations, they\ncome at a price and, as Wood and Spekkens (2015) show, violate a\ncondition that goes by the names of faithfulness (Spirtes,\nGlymour, & Scheines 1993 [2000: 35]), stability (Pearl\n2009: 49), or no-fine-tuning and which states that every\ncausal dependence implies a probabilistic dependence. Wood and\nSpekkens show that faithfulness, the causal Markov condition, and the\nassumptions that the quantum predictions are correct form an\ninconsistent set. Thus, at least one of the two\nconditions\u2014faithfulness or the Markov condition\u2014has to be\ngiven up.\n\nWhat speaks for retaining faithfulness is that it is a central\nassumption in many causal discovery algorithms. Yet there are also\narguments suggesting that faithfulness cannot be a necessary condition\non causal models (Cartwright 2001). Paradigmatic cases of violations\nof faithfulness involve cancelations among different causal paths, as\nthey occur in feedback-control structures. For example, ambient\ntemperature is causally relevant to human body temperature, even\nthough body temperature is probabilistically independent of ambient\ntemperature over a wide range of ambient temperatures, since the human\nbody responds to changes in ambient temperatures through various\nmechanisms along different causal routes, which are fine-tuned in a\nway that allow the body to maintain a constant core temperature. Thus,\nfaithfulness arguably is not a necessary condition for causal\nmodels.\n\nOne might reply, however, that canceling path violations of\nfaithfulness result from a system\u2019s specific causal structure:\nthe causal structures at issue appear to be designed precisely to\nallow for what amounts to violations of faithfulness. By contrast,\nWood and Spekkens show that if we hold on to the Markov condition,\nthen violations of faithfulness have to be a generic feature of\nquantum causal systems that violate the Bell inequalities. It is\nunclear, whether a plausible account of such generic violations of\nfaithfulness in quantum systems involving cancelling paths can be\ngiven. N\u00e4ger (2016) explores several alternative ways in which\nfaithfulness might be violated in quantum causal systems. By contrast,\nGlymour (2006) argues that instead of giving up faithfulness, we ought\nto reject the Markov condition in quantum contexts.\n\nAnother response to the problem of embedding correlations among\noutcomes in a causal structure has been to assume a type of holism\nwhich prohibits treating the spatially separated parts of the\nentangled system as distinct subsystems. The suggestion is instead to\nthink of the measurement results at the two wings of the experiment as\n\u201ca single indivisible non-local event\u201d (Skyrms 1984).\nHausman and Woodward (1999) argue that it also follows from an\ninterventionist analysis that the measurement outcomes at the two\nwings of the experiment ought to be treated as a single non-local\nevent. How to causally model entangled states remains a debated\nquestion.\n\nOne might want to conclude from the fact that quantum correlations are\nincompatible with the conjunction of faithfulness and the Markov\ncondition that causal notions are inapplicable in the quantum realm.\nYet we can experimentally interact with quantum systems and can\nintervene in and control such systems in ways that appear to be causal\nin similar ways to our interactions with classical physical systems.\nMoreover, as Sally Shrapnel (2014) has argued, there are macroscopic\nphenomena, such as the avian magneto-compass, that seem to require\nmulti-level explanations that include quantum causal effects, which\nplay an apparently causal, difference-making role. Efforts, such as\nWood and Spekkens (2015) to try to develop causal representations of\nour interactions with quantum systems have led to the emergence of a\nresearch field devoted to extending the framework of structural causal\nmodels to quantum mechanics and to develop quantum causal models\n(Costa & Shrapnel 2016; Allen et al. 2017; Shrapnel 2019). From\nthe perspective of the three philosophical projects we distinguished\nabove, these efforts are most naturally seen as engaging in the\nfunctional project of developing (and de novo engineering)\ncausal concepts appropriate for the quantum realm and showing how such\nconcepts can play a useful role in explanations and in capturing the\nways in which we can manipulate and control quantum systems.\n",
