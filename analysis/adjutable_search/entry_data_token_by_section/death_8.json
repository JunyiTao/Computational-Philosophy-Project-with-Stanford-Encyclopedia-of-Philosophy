    "main_text": "Death || Resurrection\n2.4 Resurrection\n\nIt will be useful to sharpen the loss of life account if, as seems\nconceivable, it is possible to restore life to something that\nhas died.\n\nRestoration in this sense is quite different from the revival of\nsomething, such as a frozen embryo, whose vital activities have been\nhalted. Something can be revived only if it is\nalive\u2014only if it has the capacity to deploy vital activities, as\nin the case of a frozen zygote. It is revived when it regains\nvitality. Something\u2019s life can be restored only if it\nhas lost its capacity for vital activities. Life is restored when this\ncapacity is regained.\n\nTo bring the possibility of restoration into view, imagine a\nfuturistic device, the Disassembler-Reassembler, that chops\nme into small cubes, or individual cells, or disconnected atoms, which\nit stores and later reassembles just as they were before. It is far\nfrom obvious that I would survive\u2014and that my life would\ncontinue\u2014after Reassembly. (Assuming that I am a material\nobject, the account of objects sketched in Section 1.3 implies that\nchopping me into bits ends my existence forever.) But even if my\nexistence would pick up again after Reassembly occurs, it is quite\nclear that I would not live during intervals when my atoms are stacked\nin storage. I would not even exist during such intervals. If I can be\nReassembled, my life would be restored, not revived. Restoration, not\nrevival, is a way of bringing a creature back from the dead.\n\nNow imagine a Corpse Reanimator, a device that moves\nmolecules back to where they were prior to the death of the creature\nthat left the corpse, and restarts its vital activities. Some\ntheorists say that I continue my existence as a corpse if it remains\nin good shape; they will assume that I remain in existence after\nlosing my life, and continue my existence after the Corpse Reanimator\ndoes its work. On their view the Corpse Reanimator restores\nmy life--it gives me back the capacity to engage in vital\nactivities.\n\nGiven the possibilities of restoration and revivification, it seems\nbest to refine the loss of life account, as follows:\n\nDying is the loss of an object\u2019s life\u2014the loss of\nits capacity to perpetuate itself using vital activities. An object\ndies at the time it loses this capacity. It is dead at all\ntimes afterwards, except while that capacity is regained.\n",
