    "main_text": "Confucius as Chinese Philosopher and Symbol of Traditional Culture\n1. Confucius as Chinese Philosopher and Symbol of Traditional Culture\n\nBecause of the wide range of texts and traditions identified with him,\nchoices about which version of Confucius is authoritative have changed\nover time, reflecting particular political and social priorities. The\nportrait of Confucius as philosopher is, in part, the product of a\nseries of modern cross-cultural interactions. In Imperial China,\nConfucius was identified with interpretations of the classics and\nmoral guidelines for administrators, and therefore also with training\nthe scholar-officials that populated the bureaucracy. At the same\ntime, he was closely associated with the transmission of the ancient\nsacrificial system, and he himself received ritual offerings in\ntemples found in all major cities. By the Han (202 BCE\u2013220 CE),\nConfucius was already an authoritative figure in a number of different\ncultural domains, and the early commentaries show that reading texts\nassociated with him about history, ritual, and proper behavior was\nimportant to rulers. The first commentaries to the Analects\nwere written by tutors to the crown prince (e.g., Zhang Yu \u5f35\u79b9, d. 5 BCE),\nand select experts in the \u201cFive Classics\u201d\n(Wujing \u4e94\u7d93) were given scholastic positions in the government.\nThe authority of Confucius was such that during the late Han and the\nfollowing period of disunity, his imprimatur was used to validate\ncommentaries to the classics, encoded political prophecies, and\nesoteric doctrines.\n\nBy the Song period (960\u20131279), the post-Buddhist revival known\nas \u201cNeo-Confucianism\u201d anchored readings of the dialogues\nof Confucius to a dualism between \u201ccosmic pattern\u201d\n(li \u7406) and \u201cpneumas\u201d (qi\n\u6c23), a distinctive moral cosmology that marked the tradition off\nfrom those of Buddhism and Daoism. The Neo-Confucian interpretation of\nthe Analects by Zhu Xi \u6731\u71b9 (1130\u20131200)\nintegrated the study of the Analects into a curriculum based\non the \u201cFour Books\u201d (Sishu \u56db\u66f8) that\nbecame widely influential in China, Korea, and Japan. The pre-modern\nConfucius was closely associated with good government, moral\neducation, proper ritual performance, and the reciprocal obligations\nthat people in different roles owed each other in such contexts.\n\nWhen Confucius became a character in the intellectual debates of\neighteenth century Europe, he became identified as China\u2019s first\nphilosopher. Jesuit missionaries in China sent back accounts of\nancient China that portrayed Confucius as inspired by Natural Theology\nto pursue the good, which they considered a marked contrast with the\n\u201cidolatries\u201d of Buddhism and Daoism. Back in Europe,\nintellectuals read missionary descriptions and translations of Chinese\nliterature, and writers like Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) and Nicolas-Gabriel Clerc (1726\u20131798) praised\nConfucius for his discovery of universal natural laws through reason.\nEnlightenment writers celebrated the moral philosophy of Confucius for\nits independence from the dogmatic influence of the Church. While at\ntimes he was criticized as an atheist or an advocate of despotism,\nmany Europeans viewed Confucius as a moral philosopher whose approach\nwas in line with rationalism and humanism.\n\nToday, many descriptions combine these several ways of positioning\nConfucius, but the modern interpretation of his views has been\ncomplicated by a tendency to look back on him as an emblem of the\n\u201ctraditional culture\u201d of China. In the eyes of some late\nnineteenth and twentieth century reformers who sought to fortify China\nagainst foreign influence, the moral teachings of Confucius had the\npotential to play the same role that they perceived Christianity had\ndone in the modernization of Europe and America, or serve as the basis\nof a more secular spiritual renewal that would transform the\npopulation into citizens of a modern nation-state. In the twentieth\ncentury, the pursuit of modernization also led to the rejection of\nConfucius by some reformers in the May Fourth and New Culture\nmovements, as well as by many in the Communist Party, who identified\nthe traditional hierarchies implicit in his social and political\nphilosophy with the social and economic inequalities that they sought\nto eliminate. In these modern debates, it is not just the status of \nConfucius in traditional China that made him such a potent symbol.\nHis specific association with the curriculum of the system of education of\nscholar-officials in the imperial government, and of traditional moral\nvalues more generally, connected him to the aspects of tradition worth\npreserving, or the things that held China back from modernization,\ndepending on one\u2019s point of view.\n\nAs legacies of Confucius tied to traditional ritual roles and the\npre-modern social structure were criticized by modernizers, a view of\nConfucius as a moral philosopher, already common in European readings,\ngained ascendancy in East Asia. The American-educated historian Hu Shi\n\u80e1\u9069 (1891\u20131962) wrote an early influential history\nof Chinese philosophy, beginning with Laozi \u8001\u5b50 and\nConfucius, explicitly on the model of existing histories of Western\nphilosophy. In it, Hu compared what he called the conservative aspect\nof the philosophy of Confucius to Socrates and Plato. Since at least\nthat time, Confucius has been central to most histories of Chinese\nphilosophy.\n",
