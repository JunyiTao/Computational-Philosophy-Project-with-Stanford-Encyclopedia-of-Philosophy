Paradigmatic Relational Situations\n\n\nIn his commentary on the Categories, Boethius highlights an\ninteresting feature of Aristotle\u2019s discussion of relations.  Whenever\nAristotle refers to the category of relations, he always does so in\nthe plural (\u2018things toward something\u2019), thereby departing\nfrom his usual practice of referring to categories in the singular\n(\u2018substance\u2019, \u2018quantity\u2019,\n\u2018quality\u2019, etc.). This certainly reinforces the\nparadigmatic analysis of relational situations, which requires\nrelations to come in pairs. But Boethius thinks there is a further\nreason why Aristotle refers to the category in this way\u2014namely,\nbecause its members are unique in that they cannot be\nunderstood to exist by themselves:\n\n\nThings toward something [or relations] cannot be grasped by the\nintellect by themselves or individually, so that we could say that\nthings toward something exist individually. Whatever is known\nregarding the nature of a relation must be considered together with\nsomething else. For example, when I speak of a master, this by itself\nmeans nothing if there is no slave. The naming of one relative\nimmediately brings with it another thing toward something. (In\nCategorias Aristotelis, 217.)\n\n\n\n\nFollowing Boethius, medieval philosophers often take Aristotle\u2019s use\nof the plural to indicate that the category of relations must be at\nleast conceived of as containing pairs of correlatives or\nconverse relational accidents (see, e.g., Abelard, Logica\n\u2018ingredientibus\u2019, 80\u201395; and Albert the Great,\nLiber de praedicamentis, 22). As we shall see, this point\nbecomes important for their understanding of those relational\nsituations that do not conform to the paradigm analysis of the\nCategories.\n\n\nFor now, however, let us focus on the those relational situations\nthat do conform to the paradigm. As the medievals recognize, there are\na number of questions that can be raised about the relations they\ninvolve\u2014call them \u2018paradigmatic relations\u2019. What sort\nof monadic properties or accidents are they, and how are we to\nunderstand them? As it turns out, there are only two main\npositions one can take. For convenience, we shall refer to them,\nrespectively, as \u2018reductive\u2019 and \u2018non-reductive\nrealism\u2019.\n\n\nAccording to reductive realism, which is the simplest or most\nontologically parsimonious form of realism (without polyadic\nproperties), paradigmatic relations are to be identified with\nordinary, non-relational accidents\u2014that is to say, with\naccidents falling under Aristotelian categories other than\nrelation. Thus, if Simmias is taller than Socrates, this is to be\nexplained by their respective heights, which fall under the category\nof quantity. Again, if Socrates is similar (say, in color) to Theaetetus,\nthis is to be explained by Socrates\u2019s and Theaetetus\u2019s\nparticular colors, which fall under the category of quality. And so on\nfor other paradigmatic relations.\n\n\nAccording to non-reductive realism, by contrast, paradigmatic\nrelations are to be identified not with ordinary, non-relational\naccidents, but rather with accidents of a sui generis type.\nThus, if Simmias is taller than Socrates, this is to be explained by\nappealing to a pair of sui generis accidents that are distinct\nfrom, but nonetheless necessitated by, Simmias\u2019s and\nSocrates\u2019s heights. Again, Socrates\u2019s similarity to Theaetetus\nis to be explained not by their respective colors, but by a pair of\nsui generis accidents necessitated by them. And so on for the\nrelations involved in other paradigmatic relational situations.\n\n\nIn the medieval discussion of relations, it is this\ndifference\u2014the difference between reductive and non-reductive\nrealism\u2014that constitutes the greatest divide among philosophers,\nand representatives of both positions can be found throughout the\nmedieval period. Peter Abelard (d. 1142) and Albert the Great\n(d. 1280) are, perhaps, the clearest representatives of reductive and\nnon-reductive realism, respectively, in the early and high Middle\nAges, whereas William Ockham (d. 1347) and John Duns Scotus (d. 1308)\nare well-known representatives of these positions in the later Middle\nAges.  Again, some philosophers appear to have held different\npositions at different stages of their career. Henry Harclay\n(d. 1317), for example, began his career as a staunch defender of\nScotus\u2019s non-reductive realism, but by the end of it gravitated\ntowards a position that is much closer to, and in many ways\nanticipates, Ockham\u2019s specific form of reductive\n realism.[17]\n\n\nBeginning in the mid-thirteenth century, the debate between reductive\nand non-reductive realists is often carried out in the context of the\ndiscussion whether relations are identical to their foundations. (This\nis the context, for example, in which Scotus and Ockham develop their\npositions.) By the mid-thirteenth century, moreover, it is customary\nto admit at least a conceptual distinction between relations and the\nnon-relational accidents in virtue of which these relations hold. The\nrelevant non-relational accidents come to be referred to as the\n\u2018grounds\u2019 or \u2018foundations\u2019 of relations\n(fundamenta), since their possession is thought to\nnecessitate the holding of relations. Hence, in this context, the\nimportant question is whether the distinction between relations and\ntheir foundations is merely conceptual.\n\n\nWe might expect that reductive realists would always answer this\nquestion in the affirmative, whereas non-reductive realists would\nalways answer it in the negative. It turns out, however, this is not\nthe case. For reasons to be explained below, there are some reductive\nrealists who, in spite of rejecting that relations comprise a sui\ngeneris type of monadic property, nonetheless maintain that\nrelations are in an important sense really distinct from their\nfoundations. In light of this complication, we shall continue to cast\nthe medieval debate about the nature of paradigmatic relations in terms\nof reductive and non-reductive realism rather than in terms of the\nidentity or real distinctness of relations and their foundations.\n",
