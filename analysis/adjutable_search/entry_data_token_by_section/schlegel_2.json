    "main_text": "Poetics and Aesthetics\n3. Poetics and Aesthetics\n\nThe aesthetic standard that Schlegel develops\u2014perhaps best\nexpressed in his claim that \u201ccriticism is not to judge works by\na general ideal, but is to search out the individual ideal of\nevery work\u201d (Literary Notebooks, 1733)\u2014owes debts\nboth to Herder\u2019s notions of the historical and cultural uniqueness of\nindividuals (Eichner, 1970, 42) and to Kant\u2019s stress in the\nCritique of Judgment on the impossibility of judging beauty\naccording to some external rule (see Eichner, 1970,\n35\u201336, for an account of Schlegel\u2019s successive readings of the\nthird Critique). Schlegel worked out his new criterion of the\n\u201cindividual ideal of every work\u201d in three important early\n(1796) critical essays reviewing the work of Jacobi, Georg Forster and\nLessing that give a reader a sense of his distinctive approach as\nstylist and literary theorist (Wilhelm von Humboldt called Schlegel\u2019s\nmethod in the Jacobi essay one of \u201creviewing the whole\nman\u201d\u2014i.e., the man visible precisely in his work).\nLikewise, Schlegel applies his approach to critical judgment in a\nfamous review of Goethe\u2019s Wilhelm Meister, where he insists\nthat the novel \u201cnot only judges itself but describes\nitself.\u201d\n\nGiven the importance Schlegel attaches within his romantic poetics to\nthe novel and to the novel which gives itself its own criterion,\ncritics have often examined Schlegel\u2019s own novelistic efforts in light\nof his theoretical stance. The scandalous and unfinished\nLucinde, subtitled \u201cConfessions of a Blunderer,\u201d\nwas, according to Schlegel, an attempt at \u201cshaped, artistic\nchaos,\u201d a work that was meant to be \u201cchaotic and yet\nsystematic.\u201d Part of the achievement of its \u201cshaped\nchaos\u201d is that Lucinde presents, within the form of a\nnovelistic work itself , a romantic \u2018contest\u2019 of competing\nnovelistic possibilities (see, for example, the interpretation of the\nfamous chapter on the \u201cAllegory of Impudence\u201d in Behler\n1993).\n\nThe notion of the individual work as giving itself its own\ncriterion\u2014a notion that appears later in the hermeneutic\ntradition and in Benjamin\u2019s famous essay on the concept of\ncriticism\u2014is one of a number of distinctive new facets of\nromantic poetics and aesthetics. Stylistically, Schlegel and the\nRomantics also made much of the notions of the literary fragment, the\nconcept of irony, and of wit and allegory, as well as a revised notion\nof the literary genres.\n\nThe fragment is among the most characteristic figures of the Romantic\nmovement. Although it has predecessors in writers like Chamfort (and\nearlier in the aphoristic styles of moralists like Pascal and La\nRochefoucauld), the fragment as employed by Schlegel and the Romantics\nis distinctive in both its form (as a collection of pieces by several\ndifferent authors) and its purpose. For Schlegel, a fragment as a\nparticular has a certain unity (\u201c[a] fragment, like a small work\nof art, has to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world and be\ncomplete in itself like a hedgehog,\u201d Athenaeumsfragment\n206), but remains nonetheless fragmentary in the perspective it opens\nup and in its opposition to other fragments. Its \u201cunity\u201d\nthus reflects Schlegel\u2019s view of the whole of things not as a totality\nbut rather as a \u201cchaotic universality\u201d of infinite\nopposing stances.\n\nIf a literary form like the fragment opens up the question of the\nrelation between finite and infinite, so do the literary modes of\nallegory, wit and irony\u2014allegory as a finite opening toward the\ninfinite (\u201cevery allegory means God\u201d), wit as the\n\u201cfragmentary geniality\u201d or \u201cselective\nflashing\u201d in which a unity can momentarily be seen, and irony as\ntheir synthesis (see Frank 2004, 216). Although impressed with the\nSocratic notion of irony (playful and serious, frank and deeply\nhidden, it is the freest of all licenses, since through it one rises\nabove one\u2019s own self, Schlegel says in Lyceumfragment 108),\nSchlegel nonetheless employs it in a way perhaps more reminiscent of\nthe oscillations of Fichtean selfhood. Irony is at once, as he says in\nLyceumfragment 37, self-creation, self-limitation, and\nself-destruction.\n\n\u201cPhilosophy is the true home of irony, which might be defined as\nlogical beauty,\u201d Schlegel writes in Lyceumfragment 42:\n\u201cfor wherever men are philosophizing in spoken or written\ndialogues, and provided they are not entirely systematic, irony ought\nto be produced and postulated.\u201d The task of a literary work with\nrespect to irony is, while presenting an inherently limited\nperspective, nonetheless to open up the possibility of the infinity of\nother perspectives: \u201cIrony is, as it were, the demonstration\n[epideixis] of infinity, of universality, of the feeling for\nthe universe\u201d (KA 18.128); irony is the \u201cclear\nconsciousness of eternal agility, of an infinitely teeming\nchaos\u201d (Ideas 69). A literary work can do this, much as\nSchlegel\u2019s Lucinde had, by presenting within its scope a\nrange of possible alternate plots or by mimicking the\nparabasis in which the comic playwright interposed himself\nwithin the drama itself or the role of the Italian buffo or\nclown (Lyceumfragment 42) who disrupts the spectator\u2019s\nnarrative illusion. (Some of the more striking examples of such\nmoments of ironic interposition in the works of Schlegel\u2019s literary\ncontemporaries can be found in the comedies of Tieck\u2014where, as\nSzondi (1986) argues, it is not merely the actor or playwright who\n\u201csteps out\u201d of his usual role, but in some sense the very\nrole itself.)\n\nAlong with his somewhat idiosyncratic appropriation of literary modes,\nSchlegel offers a theory of the literary genres which undergoes\nconsiderable revision as he attempts to take account both of the\nhistorical development of forms and particularly of the rise of the\nmodern novel. Moving from the pragmatic classifications of the\nEnlightenment to a philosophically oriented theory of the genres,\nSchlegel shifts from a view on which the drama (as\n\u201cobjective-subjective\u201d) develops out of\n(\u201cobjective\u201d) epic and (\u201csubjective\u201d) lyric to\none on which the epic in fact unites the other two classical modes\n(Szondi 1986, 85\u201386). The new stress on the epic genre\ncorresponds with his sense of the Roman or novel as the\n\u201cmodern epic\u201d which transcends the traditional genres and\nwith a fluid sense of genre classification itself: \u201cOne can just\nas well say that there exist infinitely many [genres] as that\nthere exists only one progressive poetical\ngenre.\u201d\n\nIn all of Schlegel\u2019s writing about literary and artistic modes\nand genres, there is also a powerful return to formative questions\nabout the relations art bears to its sometimes rivals in philosophy\nand religion. Schlegel of course revived questions about the\nphilosophical shape of literature and the literary shape of philosophy\nthat ultimately run back to Plato\u2019s \u201cancient\nquarrel\u201d (Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy 1978). And, like his fellow\nRomantics Novalis and Schleiermacher, he also closely linked art and\nreligion in ways that picked up fundamental issues in the religious\ndiscourse of his time (see Ziolkowski 1990, Smith 2019 and Hampton\n2019): the relation of the infinite and finite (\u2018only he can be\nan artist who has his own religion, an original perspective on the\ninfinite\u2019 [KFSA 2.257]) and the notions of symbol and myth and\ntheir connection to an increasingly pluralistic religious world\n(Dieckmann 1959, Speight 2019). \n",
