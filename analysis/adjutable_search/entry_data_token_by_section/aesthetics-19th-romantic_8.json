    "main_text": "Aesthetics, Epistemology and Metaphysics || Open-Endedness\n3.5 Open-Endedness\n\nKant attributes to aesthetic pleasure:\n\n\na causality in itself, namely that of maintaining the state of the\nrepresentation of the mind and the occupation of the cognitive powers\nwithout a further aim. We linger over the consideration of the\nbeautiful because this consideration strengthens and reproduces\nitself. (AK 5: 222)\n\n\nAesthetic feeling is open-ended and future-oriented. In contrast to\npractical pleasures (the \u201cpleasure in the good\u201d) and to\nprivate, sensory pleasures (the \u201cpleasure in the\nagreeable\u201d) that need to bring forth an action or an object in\norder to maintain themselves, aesthetic pleasure is self-maintaining.\nThis is partly because aesthetically enjoying an object involves a\ncommitment to remain faithful to the beauty of that object, beauty\nthat calls for and deserves an open-ended affective pursuit. The\nromantics welcomed this structure of aesthetic feeling as particularly\nsuitable for the pursuit of the Absolute. Since the Absolute can never\nbe determined, the stance that approximates it must itself be\nopen-ended. It should involve a commitment to keep striving after the\nAbsolute open-endedly.\n\nSince the romantics take philosophy to be a tendency \u201ctowards\nthe Absolute\u201d (Schlegel, ITP: 242), philosophy itself should be\nreconceived. The systematic search after first principles is not only\nhopeless, but also unfortunate. It can only slight the significance of\nthe Absolute by the effort to determine it through principles.\nInstead, philosophy should be aesthetically shaped, as an open-ended\npursuit:\n\n\nIf knowledge of the infinite is itself infinite, therefore always only\nincomplete, imperfect, then philosophy as a science can never be\ncompleted closed and perfect, it can always only strive for these high\ngoals, and try all possible ways to come closer and closer to them.\n(Schlegel, Lectures on Transcendental Philosophy, KA 12:\n166)\n\n",
