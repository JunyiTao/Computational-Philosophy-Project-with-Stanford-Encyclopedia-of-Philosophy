    "main_text": "Current relevance of operationalism || Operationalism as a strategy for increasing empirical content\n3.3 Operationalism as a strategy for increasing empirical content\n\nConceptual extension is important, especially since it served as one\nof the key initial motivations of Bridgman\u2019s thought, but it is\nonly part of the operationalist story. In more general terms,\noperationalism can be seen as a strategy for increasing the empirical\ncontent of scientific theories. What is empirical content? Karl Popper\nsaw the amount of the empirical content of a theory as the number of\nstates of the world that are forbidden by it. Regarding laws of nature\nhe said: \u201cthe more they prohibit they more they say\u201d\n(Popper 1972, 41). Or, somewhat more formally: \u201cI define the\nempirical content of a statement p as the class of\nits potential falsifiers\u201d (120). Similarly but staying away from\nthe strict falsificationist idiom, Imre Lakatos understood empirical\ncontent as the number of empirically testable predictions. Empirical\ncontent is not something we hear about very much these days in\nphilosophy of science after the receding of Popperian and Lakatosian\ndoctrines, but for Bridgman and many other operationalists it was one\nof the key issues.\n\nIf we take operationalism as a commitment to increase empirical\ncontent, Bridgman was not so much a high-handed judge who pronounced\nupon the meaningfulness of concepts in a black-and-white manner.\nRather, he offered operational analysis as a tool of self-diagnosis\nand self-improvement. He was interested in advancing science, not in\ncarping against it; like Descartes, he used skepticism as a means of\nachieving a more positive end. In this connection there is a point to\nBunge\u2019s (1988, 341) contention that \u201coperational\ndefinition\u201d is a misnomer and we should instead speak of\n\u201cindicator hypotheses\u201d that offer links between\nunobservable properties and observable ones. In my view,\nBridgman\u2019s enterprise can be understood quite well as an\ninstance of what goes by the name of \u201cconceptual\nengineering\u201d these days (see Cappelen 2018, and Brun 2016 for\nconnections with Carnapian explication). Concepts can be engineered to\nvarious ends, and in the case of operationalism the overriding concern\nis to make them as empirically meaningful as the circumstances\npermit.\n\nThe operationalist dictum could be phrased as follows: maintain and\nincrease the empirical content of theories by the use of operationally\nwell-defined concepts. It is difficult to craft an exact quantitative\nmeasure of empirical content, but we can at least say that the amount\nof empirical content depends on the number of empirically testable\nrelations that a theory specifies. That, in turn, depends on the\nnumber of independently measurable parameters. Increasing the number\nof independent parameters, or at least maintaining it, was something\nthat Bridgman sought to achieve with his operationalism. This, I\nsubmit, was one of the key reasons why he did not like conceptual\nextensions that were not backed up by measurement operations in the\nnew domain. And it seems to me that this lesson was taken to heart by\nthe operationist psychologists much more than the physicists, as Feest\n(2010; 2012) explains in her discussion of how operational definitions\nshould be understood as tools of experimental investigation.\n\nTo follow Bridgman\u2019s thinking along these lines, consider this\nintriguing passage, which at first glance looks like another complaint\nabout meaninglessness. But towards the end the main point emerges as a\nworry about diminishing empirical content:\n\nWhat is the possible meaning of the statement that the diameter of an\nelectron is 10-13 cm? Again the only answer is found by\nexamining the operations by which the number 10-13 was\nobtained. This number came by solving certain equations derived from\nthe field equations of electrodynamics, into which certain numerical\ndata obtained by experiment had been substituted. The concept of\nlength has therefore now been so modified as to include that theory of\nelectricity embodied in the field equations, and, most important,\nassumes the correctness of extending these equations from the\ndimensions in which they may be verified experimentally into a region\nin which their correctness is one of the most important and\nproblematical of present-day questions in physics. To find whether the\nfield equations are correct on a small scale, we must verify the\nrelations demanded by the equations between the electric and magnetic\nforces and the space co\u00f6rdinates, to determine which involves\nmeasurement of lengths. But if these space co\u00f6rdinates cannot be\ngiven an independent meaning apart from the equations, not only is the\nattempted verification of the equations impossible, but the question\nitself is meaningless. If we stick to the concept of length by itself,\nwe are landed in a vicious circle. As a matter of fact, the concept of\nlength disappears as an independent thing, and fuses in a complicated\nway with other concepts, all of which are themselves altered thereby,\nwith the result that the total number of concepts used in describing\nnature at this level is reduced in\n number.[6]\n (Bridgman 1927, 21\u201322)\n\n\nSuch a reduction in the number of operationally meaningful concepts\nwill almost inevitably result in a corresponding reduction in the\nnumber of relations that can be tested empirically. A good scientist\nwould fight against such a prospect of diminished empirical\ncontent.\n\nThis concern with empirical content also explains why Bridgman was not\ncontent with the mainstream post-positivist philosophical discourse on\nconcept-formation and empirical significance, exemplified by the works\nof Carl Hempel and Willard Van Orman Quine. As noted in Section 2.2,\nBridgman did not object to theoretical science creating a system of\nconcepts and laws that made contact with observations only at some\npoints. However, Quinean holism, in which the unit of empirical\nsignificance was the entire system of knowledge, had no particular\nconcern about increasing the number of those points-of-contact with\nexperience. Bridgman\u2019s ideal was to operationalize each and\nevery concept if possible, and each case of de-operationalization rang\nalarm bells in his head.\n\nRecognizing the importance of empirical content helps us make sense of\nBridgman\u2019s complex attitude toward theoretical concepts. In a\nlittle-known section of The Logic of Modern Physics, he\ndiscussed what he called \u201cmental constructs\u201d in science,\nparticularly those created in order to \u201cenable us to deal with\nphysical situations which we cannot directly experience through our\nsenses, but with which we have contact indirectly and by\ninference\u201d (1927, 53\u201360). Not all constructs are the\nsame:\n\nThe essential point is that our constructs fall into two classes:\nthose to which no physical operations correspond other than those\nwhich enter the definition of the construct, and those which admit of\nother operations, or which could be defined in several alternative\nways in terms of physically distinct operations. This difference in\nthe character of constructs may be expected to correspond to essential\nphysical differences, and these physical differences are much too\nlikely to be overlooked in the thinking of physicists. (Bridgman 1927,\n59\u201360)\n\n\nThey were also very easily overlooked in the thinking of\nphilosophers who debated his ideas. What Bridgman says here\nis entirely contrary to the common image of his doctrines. When it\ncame to constructs, \u201cof which physics is full,\u201d Bridgman\nnot only admitted that one concept could correspond to many different\noperations, but even suggested that such multiplicity of operational\nmeaning was \u201cwhat we mean by the reality of things not given\ndirectly by experience.\u201d In an illustration of these ideas,\nBridgman argued that the concept of stress within a solid body had\nphysical reality, but the concept of electric field did not, since the\nlatter only ever manifested itself through force and electric charge,\nby which it was defined (Bridgman 1927, 57). This comes down to the\nstance that a theoretical concept without direct operational meaning\nis worthwhile only if it serves as a mediator connecting two or more\noperationally meaningful concepts, creating an empirically testable\nrelation. This is in fact not so different from Hempel\u2019s view\nquoted in Section 2.2, albeit with a different emphasis.\n",
