    "main_text": "Evil-Skepticism Versus Evil-Revivalism\n1. Evil-Skepticism Versus Evil-Revivalism\n\nEvil-skeptics believe we should abandon the concept of evil. On this\nview we can more accurately, and less perniciously, understand and\ndescribe morally despicable actions, characters, and events using more\npedestrian moral concepts such as badness and wrongdoing. By contrast,\nevil-revivalists believe that the concept of evil has a place in our\nmoral and political thinking and discourse. On this view, the concept\nof evil should be revived, not abandoned (see Russell 2006 and\n2007).\n\nSomeone who believes that we should do away with moral discourse\naltogether could be called a moral-skeptic or a moral nihilist.\nEvil-skepticism is not as broad. Evil-skeptics believe the concept of\nevil is particularly problematic and should be abandoned while other\nmoral concepts, such as right, wrong, good, and bad, are worth\nkeeping.\n\nEvil-skeptics give three main reasons to abandon the concept of evil:\n(1) the concept of evil involves unwarranted metaphysical commitments\nto dark spirits, the supernatural, or the devil; (2) the concept of\nevil is useless because it lacks explanatory power; and (3) the\nconcept of evil can be harmful or dangerous when used in moral,\npolitical, and legal contexts, and so, it should not be used in those\ncontexts, if at all.\n",
