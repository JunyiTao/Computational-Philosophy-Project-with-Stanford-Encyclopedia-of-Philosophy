    "main_text": "The Special Theory of Relativity\n3. The Special Theory of Relativity\n\nThe Special Theory of Relativity (Einstein, 1905) was presented as a\ngeometric theory of spacetime in Minkowski\n (1908).[5]\n For our purposes, the key change from Newtonian spacetime to\nMinkowski spacetime is that in the latter it is no longer the case\nthat the temporal interval between any two points or events in the\nspacetime, \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), is a\nwell-defined quantity. In fact, the temporal interval between two\npoints in the spacetime (and hence the simultaneity of two points in\nthe spacetime) is not defined at all until a coordinate system or\nframe of reference (with some arbitrarily chosen spacetime point as\norigin of the frame) is chosen. A peculiar feature of special\nrelativity (as opposed Newtonian physics) is that each inertial frame\ndefined by an \u201cobserver\u201d passing through the chosen origin\nand moving with some constant non-zero velocity that is less than the\nspeed of light (the only coordinate systems or frames of reference\nthat will be considered in our discussion of the special theory) picks\nout a distinct set of points as simultaneous with the origin.\nThis feature of special relativity is called the relativity of\nsimultaneity.\n\nThe relativity of simultaneity is a consequence of two startling\nassumptions. First, each of these \u201cobservers\u201d, no matter\nat what (subluminal) speed or in which direction they or the source of\nthe light are moving (as long as neither the speed nor the directions\nchange), must come to the same result (conventionally indicated as\n\\(c)\\) when they measure the speed of light. We will not attempt to\njustify the assumption of the constancy of the speed of light here,\nthough many standard texts present the empirical and theoretical\nbackground that led to it. Nor is it obvious that this assumption\nleads to the relativity of simultaneity, though one of the joys of\neven elementary presentations of the subject is that this prima\nfacie astonishing connection can be convincingly demonstrated to\npersistent non-specialists.\n\nThe second assumption typically made in presentations of the special\ntheory is the Principle of Relativity: All inertial frames\nare completely equivalent for the formulation of the laws of\n physics.[6]\n\nA glance back at Figure 1 reminds us that presentism and possibilism\nsuppose that one plane of simultaneity is uniquely metaphysically\nimportant. In the former view, it represents all that exists. In the\nlatter view, it is the locus of becoming, the dividing line between\nthe merely possible future and the actual past-plus-present. The\nspecial theory of relativity tells us that there is an infinity of\nplanes of simultaneity passing through any given spacetime point and\nthat no physical test can distinguish one from amongst the lot. What\nwas supposedly metaphysically distinguished is physically\nindistinguishable. Assuming that we humans are complex physical\nsystems, then we have no way to distinguish the present from\namongst the multitude of putative presents.\n\nAn enthusiast could make much of this fact. For instance, the\nmathematician (and science fiction writer) Rudy Rucker wrote (1984, p.\n149):\n\nAs it turns out, it is actually impossible to find any\nobjective and universally acceptable definition of \u201call of\nspace, taken at this instant.\u201d This follows \u2026 from\nEinstein\u2019s special theory of relativity. The idea of the block\nuniverse is, thus, more than an attractive metaphysical theory. It is\na well-established scientific fact.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the distinguished philosopher and logician Arthur\nPrior thought that the above conclusion showed that special relativity\nis an incomplete view of reality (Prior,\n 1970):[7]\n\nOne possible reaction to this situation, which to my mind is perfectly\nrespectable though it isn\u2019t very fashionable, is to insist that\nall that physics has shown to be true or likely is that in some cases\nwe can never know, we can never physically find out,\nwhether something is actually happening or merely has happened or will\nhappen.\n\n\nWe shall look at more nuanced reactions to the relativity of\nsimultaneity below, but first it will be useful to introduce an\nargument that plays somewhat the same role in Minkowski spacetime as\nMcTaggart\u2019s argument did in Newtonian spacetime. Versions of the\nargument are endorsed in papers by the physicist Wim Rietdijk (1966,\n1976) and the philosopher Hilary Putnam (1967), but the presentation\nhere will be based on an example found in Roger Penrose\u2019s book,\nThe Emperor\u2019s New Mind.\n\nImagine that the Andromeda galaxy, which is about two million light\nyears or \\(2\\times 10^{19}\\) kilometers from Earth, is at rest with\nrespect to Earth. On Earth two friends walk past each other, Alice\nwalking along the Earth-Andromeda line towards Andromeda, Bob walking\nalong that line but away from Andromeda. Each is walking at a\ncomfortable pace, say 4 km/hour. One can calculate that their planes\n(or spaces) of simultaneity at the instant at which they pass each\nother on Earth (Call the event of their meeting \\(\\mathbf{O})\\)\nintersect the history or world line of Andromeda about 5\n\u00be days apart. (Call these two events \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\), respectively. We are idealizing Andromeda as a point,\nfor the purpose of this example.) Imagine, finally, that during this 5\n\u00be day period between \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) a\nmomentous thing happens. The Andromedeans launch a space fleet aimed\nat invading Earth.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The Andromedean Invasion\n\n\nThe launch of the invading fleet is prior to \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and so\nin some sense in Alice\u2019s past. But since the launch is\nafter \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), it is in that same sense in Bob\u2019s future.\nPenrose comments:\n\nTwo people pass each other on the street; and according to one of the\ntwo people, an Andromedean space fleet has already set off on its\njourney, while to the other, the decision as to whether or not the\njourney will actually take place has not yet been made. How can there\nstill be some uncertainty as to the outcome of that decision? If to\neither person the decision has already been made, then surely\nthere cannot be any uncertainty. The launching of the space\nfleet is an inevitability. (p. 303)\n\n\nThis is an odd situation indeed. An event in Bob\u2019s future seems\nin some way to become fixed or inevitable by being in Alice\u2019s\npast. But that is not the end of the oddness here. Imagine that at\npoint \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) (where Alice\u2019s plane of simultaneity\nintersects the world line of Andromeda) there is an Andromedean,\nCarol, who is walking directly towards Earth at about 4 km/hour. Then\nCarol\u2019s plane of simultaneity intersects Earth at some point\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) which is about 11 \u00bd days after \\(\\mathbf{O}\\),\nthe meeting of Alice and Bob. If all events (like\n\\(\\mathbf{A})\\) in Alice\u2019s past or present at \\(\\mathbf{O}\\)\nhave happened, are fixed, or are real, then the principle of\nrelativity (the second assumption of the special theory introduced\nabove) suggests that we must also extend the same courtesy to Carol;\nand so simultaneous with the fixed and real event \\(\\mathbf{A}\\)\n(Carol\u2019s walking towards Earth at exactly the point at which\nAlice\u2019s plane of simultaneity intersects the history of\nAndromeda) is the event \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) (and so fixed and real), the\nintersection of Carol\u2019s plane of simultaneity with Earth, which\nis in the future of both Alice and Bob. It is easy to see\nthat, by adjusting the speeds of Alice and Carol, any event to the\nfuture of \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) can be shown to be fixed or real or\ninevitable. But \\(\\mathbf{O}\\) itself was just an arbitrarily chosen\npoint in the spacetime. \u201cIt begins to seem that if anything is\ndefinite at all,\u201d we might echo Penrose, \u201cthen the entire\nspace-time must indeed be definite! There can be no\n\u2018uncertain\u2019 future.\u201d (p. 304)\n\nRoberto Torretti (1983, p. 249) calls the resulting view of the\ndefiniteness or fixity of all events in the spacetime\nchronogeometrical determinism. A slightly better name might\nbe chronogeometrical fatalism, as we will see below. In order\nto see more clearly, however, what has gone wrong in the argument\nabove, it will be useful first to look more closely at the problems\nattendant upon trying to import our commonsense or classical\nintuitions about time into the understanding of Minkowski spacetime\nand then to describe briefly the structures peculiar to that spacetime\nitself. To begin with the first task, one of the most notable attempts\nto bring our time into Minkowski spacetime is to be found in Sellars\n(1962), a determined attempt by one of the most profound systematic\nmetaphysicians of the latter half of the 20th century.\n",
