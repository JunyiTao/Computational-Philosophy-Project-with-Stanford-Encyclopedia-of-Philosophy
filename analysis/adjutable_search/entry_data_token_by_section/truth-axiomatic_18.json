    "main_text": "Non-classical approaches to self-reference\n5. Non-classical approaches to self-reference\nThe theories of truth discussed thus far are all axiomatized in\nclassical logic. Some authors have also looked into axiomatic theories\nof truth based on non-classical logic (see, for example, Field 2008,\nHalbach and Horsten 2006, Leigh and Rathjen 2012). There are a number\nof reasons why a logic weaker than classical logic may be\npreferred. The most obvious is that by weakening the logic, some\ncollections of axioms of truth that were previously inconsistent\nbecome consistent. Another common reason is that the axiomatic theory\nin question intends to capture a particular non-classical semantics of\ntruth, for which a classical background theory may prove unsound.\n\nThere is also a large number of approaches that employ paraconsistent or substructural logics. In most cases these approaches do not employ an axiomatic base theory such as Peano arithmetic and therefore deviate form the setting considered here, although there is no technical obstacle in applying paraconsistent or substructural logics to truth theories over such base theories. Here we cover only accounts that are close to the setting considered above. For further information on the application of substructural and paraconsistent logics to the truth-theoretic paradoxes see the relevant section in the entry on the liar paradox.\n\n",
