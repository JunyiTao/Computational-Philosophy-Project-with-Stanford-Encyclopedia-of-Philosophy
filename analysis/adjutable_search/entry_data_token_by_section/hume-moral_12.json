Allegiance to Government\n\n\nA small society can maintain a subsistence-level economy without any\ndominion of some people over others, relying entirely on voluntary\ncompliance with conventions of ownership, transfer of goods, and\nkeeping of agreements, and relying on exclusion as the sole means of\nenforcement. But an increase in population and/or material\nproductivity, Hume thinks, tends to stimulate a destabilizing rate of\ndefection from the rules: more luxury goods greatly increase the\ntemptation to act unjustly, and more anonymous transactions make it\nseem likely that one will get away with it. Though people are aware\nthat injustice is destructive of social cooperation and so ultimately\ndetrimental to their own interests, this knowledge will not enable\nthem to resist such strong temptation, because of an inherent human\nweakness: we are more powerfully drawn to a near-term good even when\nwe know we will pay for it with the loss of a greater long-term\ngood. This creates the need for government to enforce the rules of\nproperty and promise (the \u201claws of nature,\u201d as Hume\nsometimes rather ironically calls them, since on his view they are not\nnatural). This is the reason for the invention of government. Once in\npower, rulers can also make legitimate use of their authority to\nresolve disputes over just what the rules of justice require in\nparticular cases, and to carry out projects for the common good such\nas building roads and dredging harbors.\n\n\nHume thinks it unnecessary to prove that allegiance to government is\nthe product of convention and not mere nature, since governments are\nobviously social creations. But he does need to explain the creation of\ngovernments and how they solve the problem he describes. He speculates\nthat people who are unaccustomed to subordination in daily life might\ndraw the idea for government from their experience of wars with other\nsocieties, when they must appoint a temporary commander. To overcome\nthe preference for immediate gain over long-term security, the people\nwill need to arrange social circumstances so that the conformity to\njustice is in people\u2019s immediate interest. This cannot be done with\nrespect to all the people, but it can be done for a few. So the people\nselect magistrates (judges, kings, and the like) and so position them\n(presumably with respect to rank and wealth) that it will be in those\nmagistrates\u2019 immediate interest not only to obey but to enforce the\nrules of justice throughout society. Hume is vague about the incentives \nof the magistrates, but apparently they are so pleased with their own\nshare of wealth and status that they are not tempted by the possessions\nof others; and since they are \u201cindifferent\u2026 to the\ngreatest part of the state,\u201d they have no incentive to assist\nanyone in any crimes (T3.2.7.6). Thus the magistrates\u2019 most immediate\ninterest lies in preserving their own status and wealth by protecting\nsociety. (Perhaps more directly, they stand to lose their favored\nstatus if they are found by the people not to enforce the rules of\njustice.)\n\n\nIt is possible for the people to agree to appoint magistrates in spite\nof the incurable human attraction to the proximal good even when\nsmaller than a remote good, because this predilection only takes\neffect when the lesser good is immediately at hand. When considering\ntwo future goods, people always prefer the greater, and make decisions\naccordingly.  So looking to the future, people can decide now to\nempower magistrates to force them to conform to the rules of justice\nin the time to come so as to preserve society.  When the time comes to\nobey and individuals are tempted to violate the rules, the long-range\nthreat this poses to society may not move them to desist, but the\nimmediate threat of punishment by the magistrates will.\n\n\nWe initially obey our magistrates from self-interest. But once\ngovernment is instituted, we come to have a moral obligation to obey\nour governors; this is another artificial duty that needs to be\nexplained. On Hume\u2019s view it is independent of the obligation of promises.\nWe are bound to our promises and to obey the magistrates\u2019 commands on\nparallel grounds: because both kinds of conformity are so manifestly beneficial for \nall. Governors merely insure that the rules of justice are generally\nobeyed in the sort of society where purely voluntary conventions would\notherwise break down. As in the case of fidelity to promises, the\ncharacter trait of allegiance to our governors generates sympathy with\nits beneficiaries throughout society, making us approve the trait as a\nvirtue.\n\n\nThe duty of allegiance to our present governors does not depend upon\ntheir or their ancestors\u2019 divine right to govern, Hume says, nor on\nany promise we have made to them or any contract that transfers rights\nto them, but rather on the general social value of having a\ngovernment.  Rulers thus need not be chosen by the people in order to\nbe legitimate.  Consequently, who is the ruler will often be a matter\nof salience and imaginative association; and it will be no ground for\nlegitimate rebellion that a ruler was selected arbitrarily.  Rulers\nidentified by long possession of authority, present possession,\nconquest, succession, or positive law will be suitably salient and so\nlegitimate, provided their rule tends to the common good.  Although\ngovernments exist to serve the interests of their people, changing\nmagistrates and forms of government for the sake of small advantages\nto the public would yield disorder and upheaval, defeating the purpose\nof government; so our duty of allegiance forbids this.  A government\nthat maintains conditions preferable to what they would be without it\nretains its legitimacy and may not rightly be overthrown.  But\nrebellion against a cruel tyranny is no violation of our duty of\nallegiance, and may rightly be undertaken.  \n\n\nHume does advocate some forms of government as being preferable to\nothers, particularly in his Essays. Governments structured by\nlaws are superior to those controlled by the edicts of rulers or ruling\nbodies (\u201cThat Politics May Be Reduced to a Science\u201d).\nRepresentative democracy is superior to direct democracy, and\n\u201cfree\u201d (popular) governments are more hospitable to trade\nthan \u201cabsolute\u201d governments (ibid.). Hume speculates that a\nperfect government would be a representative democracy of\nproperty-holders with division of powers and some features of\nfederalism (\u201cIdea of a Perfect Commonwealth\u201d). He defends\nhis preferences by arguing that certain forms of government are less\nprone to corruption, faction (with the concomitant threat of civil\nwar), and oppressive treatment of the people than others; that is, they\nare more likely to enforce the rules of justice, adjudicate fairly, and\nencourage peace and prosperity.\n\n\nHume famously criticizes the social contract theory of political\nobligation. According to his own theory, our duty to obey our\ngovernors is not reducible to an instance of our duty to fulfill\npromises, but arises separately though in a way parallel to the\ngenesis of that duty.  Hume denies that any native citizen or subject\nin his own day has made even a tacit promise to obey the government,\ngiven that citizens do not think they did any such thing, but rather\nthink they are born to obey it. Even a tacit contract requires that\nthe will be engaged, and we have no memory of this; nor do governments\nrefrain from punishing disloyalty in citizens who have given no tacit\npromise.\n",
