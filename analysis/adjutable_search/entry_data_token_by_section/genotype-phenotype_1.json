    "main_text": "The Goals and Open Questions of Johannsen (1911)\n2. The Goals and Open Questions of Johannsen (1911)\n\nMarcel Weber (2014) notes that, because many areas of modern biology\n\u201care profoundly experimental disciplines, an increased attention\n[in philosophy of biology] to the experiment in biology was\ninevitable\u201d (see also entry on\n gene).\n Yet, how an area of biology becomes experimental in the first place\nas well as the implications of that shift also warrant attention. A\nrecounting of Johannsen (1911) in this vein serves not only to\nintroduce his original genotype-phenotype distinction, but also to\npoint to various conceptual and methodological complexities that are\nassociated with redefining heredity on the basis of breeding\nexperiments. The detail in this section and the next is important not\nas a matter of doing history, but to insert distance from the\npredominant current-day meanings and establish a space in which modern\nusers of his terms can consider issues that had been left behind.\n",
