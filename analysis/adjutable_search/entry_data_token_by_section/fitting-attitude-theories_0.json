    "main_text": "Clarifying FA Theories: Some Choice Points || Metaphysical, Conceptual, or Semantic?\n1.1 Metaphysical, Conceptual, or Semantic?\n\nEarly proponents of FA theory were sometimes unclear about whether\ntheir intent was to elucidate the natures of evaluative concepts,\nterms, or properties (e.g., Brentano 1889/2009; Broad 1930; Ewing\n1939, 1947). In the last decade, however, FA theorists have tended to\ntheorize mostly in a metaphysical mode, seeking to account for various\nevaluative properties and facts (McHugh and Way 2016; Howard 2019;\nRowland 2019). This entry follows the current trend and characterizes\nFA theories as metaphysical theses. That being said, for many of the\nnecessary equivalences between specific evaluative and normative\nproperties that certain FA theories entail, their semantic and\nconceptual counterparts plausibly hold with the corresponding kind of\nnecessity. For example, one might reasonably claim that it\u2019s\ntrue in virtue of the meanings of the constituent terms, and so\nanalytic, that someone is admirable just in case they\u2019re fitting\nto admire (Brandt 1946; Kjellmer 1986). And some have recently argued\nthat it\u2019s also true of conceptual necessity, i.e., in virtue of\nthe identity of the concepts, that something is generically valuable,\nor valuable simpliciter, if and only if it\u2019s fitting to\nvalue, or \u201cworth valuing\u201d (Svavarsd\u00f3ttir\n2014).\n\nMany contemporary FA theorists, then, take their FA theories to\nprovide metaphysical accounts of evaluative facts and properties. But\nthere are various ways to understand what a metaphysical account of a\nproperty is. Sometimes such accounts are said to reveal the\nessences of the properties they aim to explain (Fine 1994),\nother times to assert property identities (Jackson 1998), and\nstill other times to specify grounds (Rosen 2015b; Berker\n2018). Common to many contemporary FA theorists, however, is the claim\nthat their metaphysical accounts of evaluative properties in terms of\nnormative properties of human responses entail that facts involving\nthe latter are explanatorily prior to facts\ninvolving the former, such that the former facts are always grounded\nin the latter. This is important for several reasons. First, it\nreveals a core commitment of many contemporary FA theories, viz., that\nthe evaluative facts they seek to explain obtain in virtue of\nnormative facts about human responses, rather than the other way\naround. An FA theory of facts about what\u2019s fearsome,\nfor instance, would entail that whenever something is fearsome,\nthat\u2019s because it\u2019s fitting to fear. Second, this\nexplanatory commitment would seem to rule out understanding FA\ntheories as stating property identities, given the irreflexivity of\nthe grounding relation (see the entry on\n metaphysical grounding).\n\nSome claim that the order of explanatory priority posited by FA\ntheories conflicts with commonsense (for discussion, see Stratton-Lake\nand Hooker 2006; Jacobson 2011): if something is fitting to value, for\ninstance, isn\u2019t that precisely because it\u2019s valuable? In\nother words, doesn\u2019t the fittingness of valuing a valuable thing\nderive from the value of that thing rather than the reverse? And\nindeed, isn\u2019t the value of valuable things, at least in\nprinciple, independent of any actual or possible human responses to\nthose things? Such concerns are discussed further in sections 2.1 and\n3.2.\n",
