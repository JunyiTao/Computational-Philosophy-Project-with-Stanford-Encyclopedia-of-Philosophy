The Center was, as Feyerabend later said, \u201cone of\nthe foremost institutions in the field\u201d (p. 115). There he met\nFeigl, Carl Hempel, Ernest Nagel, Hilary Putnam, Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum,\nGrover Maxwell, E.L.Hill, Paul Meehl, and others. He returned to the\nCenter in 1958, having accepted another invitation to work there,\nbacked by an NSF grant. He often went back there in subsequent years.\n\n\nAround this time, many of Feyerabend\u2019s most important early\npapers were published. In them, under the influence of both Popper and\nWittgenstein, Feyerabend initiated a vigourous critique of the\nthen-orthodox philosophies of science provided by descendants of the\nVienna Circle, \u201cLogical Empiricist\u201d thinkers such as\nRudolph Carnap, Feigl, Nagel, and Hempel. This critique was conducted\nthrough a study of the relationship between observation and\ntheory.\n\nIn perhaps the most important of these early publications, \u201cAn\nAttempt at a Realistic Interpretation of Experience\u201d (1958),\nFeyerabend argued against positivism and in favour of a scientific\nrealist account of the relation between theory and experience, largely\non grounds familiar from Karl Popper\u2019s falsificationist views.\nPositivist theories of meaning, he complained, have consequences which\nare \u201cat variance with scientific method and reasonable\nphilosophy\u201d (Philosophical Papers, Volume 1, p. 17). In\nparticular, they imply what Feyerabend dubbed the \u201cstability\nthesis\u201d, that even major changes in theory will not affect the\nmeanings of terms in the scientific observation-language. Against this\nsupposition, Feyerabend defended what he called \u201cThesis\nI\u201d, the idea that\n\nthe interpretation of an observation-language is determined by the\ntheories which we use to explain what we observe, and it changes as\nsoon as those theories change. (ibid., p. 31).\n\n\nThesis I reversed the direction of interpretation which the\npositivists had presupposed. Instead of meaning seeping upwards from\nthe level of experience (or the observation-language), Feyerabend had\nit trickling down from theory to experience. For\nhim, theory is meaningful independently of experience, rather than\nvice-versa. The roots of this view clearly lie in his contextual\ntheory of meaning, according to which meaning is conferred on terms by\nvirtue of their participation in theoretical contexts. It\nseems to imply that there is no principled semantic distinction\nbetween theoretical terms and observation terms. And Feyerabend soon\nfollowed up this implication with his \u201cPragmatic Theory of\nObservation\u201d, according to which what is important about\nobservation-sentences is not their having a special core of empirical\nmeaning, but their causal role in the production and refutation of\ntheories. \n\nIn 1958, Feyerabend had been invited to spend one year at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, and accepted. When this visiting\nappointment ended, the University administration decided to hire him\non the basis of his publications and, of course, his big mouth (p.\n115). But because of his grant to work at Minneapolis, he only started\nlecturing full-time at Berkeley in 1960. There he encountered Thomas\nKuhn, and read Kuhn\u2019s forthcoming book The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions in draft form. He then wrote to Kuhn about\nthe book (these letters have recently been published in Studies in\nthe History and Philosophy of Science, 26, 1995). But he was not\nquite ready to take on Kuhn\u2019s descriptive-historical approach to\nthe philosophy of science. Although more and more historical examples\npeppered his published work, he was still using them to support fairly\northodox falsificationist conclusions.\n\nIn his meta-methodology, Feyerabend applied to the dispute over the\ninterpretation of scientific theories a strong measure of Popperian\nmethodological conventionalism, arguing that the dispute between\nrealists and instrumentalists is not a factual issue but a matter of\nchoice. We can choose to see theories either as descriptions of\nreality (scientific realism) or as instruments of prediction\n(instrumentalism), depending on what ideals of scientific knowledge we\naspire to. Adherence to these competing ideals (roughly: high\ninformative content on the one hand, and sense-certainty on the other)\nis to be judged by their respective consequences. Stressing that\nphilosophical theories have not merely reflected science but have\nchanged it, Feyerabend argued further that the form\nof our knowledge can be altered to fit our ideals. So we can\nhave certainty, and theories that merely summarise\nexperience, if we wish. But, mobilising the usual equation between\nempirical content and testability (common to Carnap, Popper and\nFeyerabend), he urged that we should decisively reject the ideal of\ncertainty and opt instead for theories which go beyond experience and\nsay something informative about reality itself. In this respect, he\nclearly followed Popper\u2019s lead, reconstruing empiricism as a\ndoctrine about the most desirable form for our theories, rather than\nas a view about the sources of knowledge.\n\nFeyerabend argued that the idea, common to positivists, that the\ninterpretation of observation terms doesn\u2019t depend upon the\nstatus of our theoretical knowledge, has consequences undesirable to\npositivists. One of these is that \u201cevery positivistic\nobservation language is based upon a metaphysical ontology\u201d\n(Philosophical Papers, Volume 1, p. 21). Another follows from\nthe thesis, which he relishes, that the theories we hold influence our\nlanguage, and maybe even our perceptions. This implies that as long as\nwe use only one empirically adequate theory, we will be unable to\nimagine alternative accounts of reality. If we also accept the\npositivist view that our theories are summaries of experience, those\ntheories will be void of empirical content and untestable, and hence\nthere will be a diminution in the critical, argumentative function of\nour language. Just as purely transcendent metaphysical theories are\nunfalsifiable, so too what began as an all-embracing scientific theory\noffering certainty will, under these circumstances, have become an\nirrefutable dogma, a myth. It is argued in Preston 1997\n(chapter 5) that his antipathy toward this \u201cmyth\npredicament\u201d was one the main driving-forces behind\nFeyerabend\u2019s views at the time.\n\nFeyerabend defended a realism according to which \u201cthe\ninterpretation of a scientific theory depends upon nothing but the\nstate of affairs it describes\u201d (Philosophical Papers, Volume\n1, p. 42). At the same time he claimed to find in\nWittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical Investigations a\ncontextual theory of meaning according to which the meaning of terms\nis determined not by their use, nor by their connection with\nexperience, but by the role they play in the wider context of a theory\nor explanation. Thesis I, the key proposition of Feyerabend\u2019s\nearly work, is supposed to encapsulate both the contextual\ntheory of meaning and scientific realism. Only realism, by insisting\non interpreting theories in their most vulnerable form as\nuniversally-quantified statements which strive for truth, leads to\nscientific progress instead of stagnation, he argued. Only realism\nallows us to live up to the highest intellectual ideals of critical\nattitude, honesty, and testability.\n\nUnlike positivism, which conflicts with science by taking experiences\nas unanalysable building-blocks, realism treats experiences as\nanalysable, explaining them as the result of processes not immediately\naccessible to observation. Experiences and observation-statements are\nthus revealed as more complex and structured than positivism had\nrealised. Feyerabend over-extended the contextual theory of meaning to\napply not only to theoretical terms but to observation terms too,\narguing that there is no special \u201cproblem\u201d of theoretical\nentities, and that the distinction between observation terms and\ntheoretical terms is a purely pragmatic one. If, as the contextual\ntheory also implies, observation-statements depend on theoretical\nprinciples, any inadequacy in these principles will be transmitted to\nthe observation-statements they subtend, whence our beliefs about what\nis observed may be in error, and even our experiences themselves can\nbe criticised for giving only an approximate account of what is going\non in reality. All our statements, beliefs and experiences\nare \u201chypothetical\u201d. Observations and experiments always\nneed interpretation, and different interpretations are supplied by\ndifferent theories. If existing meanings embody theoretical\nprinciples, then instead of passively accepting\nobservation-statements, we should attempt to find and test the\ntheoretical principles implicit in them, which may require us to\nchange those meanings.\n\nFeyerabend therefore idolised semantic instability, arguing that the\nsemantic stability presupposed by positivist accounts of reduction,\nexplanation and confirmation, has been and should be violated if we\nwant progress in science. If meaning is determined by theory, terms in\nvery different theories simply cannot share the same meaning: they\nwill be \u201cincommensurable\u201d. Any attempt to derive the\nprinciples of an old theory from those of a new one must either be\nunsuccessful or must effect a change in the meaning of the old\ntheory\u2019s terms. The \u201ctheoretical reduction\u201d beloved\nof Logical Empiricists is therefore actually more like\nreplacement of one theory and its ontology by another. At the\nend of his well-known 1962 paper \u201cExplanation, Reduction, and\nEmpiricism\u201d, in which he introduced the concept of\nincommensurability, Feyerabend concluded that this concept precluded\nany formal account of explanation, reduction or confirmation.\n(Kuhn\u2019s book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\nin which the same term was used to characterize a related concept, was\npublished in the same year).\n\nIn his first major published excursion from the philosophy of science,\nFeyerabend applied these ideas to the mind/body problem. In two papers\npublished in 1963, he sought to defend materialism (roughly, the view\nthat everything which exists is physical) against the supposition that\nthe mind cannot be a physical thing. Although these papers exhibit a\nrather unclear mixture of views, they are now remembered primarily for\nhaving ushered in the position known as \u201celiminative\nmaterialism\u201d, according to which our way of conceiving the\nmind and mental phenomena amounts to a seriously inadequate theory\nwhich is in conflict with a (materialistic) scientific account of\nthose same things. Feyerabend suggested that the two theories in\nquestion were incommensurable, but that nevertheless we ought to\nprefer the materialistic one on general methodological grounds. This\nradical view of the mind/body problem has been one of\nFeyerabend\u2019s most important legacies. Even though Feyerabend\nhimself seems to have given it up in the late 1970s, it was taken up\nby Richard Rorty and, more recently, by Paul and Patricia\nChurchland.\n\nIn Feyerabend\u2019s version of the incommensurability thesis, the\nsemantic principles of construction underpinning a theory (in its\nrealist interpretation) can be violated or\n\u201csuspended\u201d by another theory. As a result, theories\ncannot always be compared with respect to their content, as\n\u201crationalists\u201d would like. It took Feyerabend a while to\nsee it, for he did not officially subscribe to this view\nuntil the late 1960s, but this opens the door to relativism, the view\nthat there is no objective way of choosing between theories or\ntraditions. This is perhaps the most notorious and widely-reviled\nconsequence of the contextual theory of meaning.\n\nIn the ground-breaking central papers from this period of\nFeyerabend\u2019s oeuvre such as \u201cHow to be a Good\nEmpiricist\u201d (1963), \u201cRealism and Instrumentalism\u201d\n(1964), \u201cProblems of Empiricism\u201d and \u201cReply to\nCriticism\u201d (1965), his most important argument for scientific\nrealism was methodological: realism is desirable because it demands\nthe proliferation of new and incompatible theories. This leads to\nscientific progress because it results in each theory having more\nempirical content that it otherwise would, since a theory\u2019s\ntestability is proportional to the number of potential falsifiers it\nhas, and the production of alternative theories is the only reliable\nway to ensure the existence of potential falsifiers. So scientific\nprogress comes through \u201ctheoretical pluralism\u201d,\nallowing a plurality of incompatible theories, each of which will\ncontribute by competition to maintaining and enhancing the\ntestability, and thus the empirical content, of the others. According\nto Feyerabend\u2019s pluralistic test model, theories are\ntested against one another. He thus idealised what Kuhn called\n\u201cpre-paradigm\u201d periods and \u201cscientific\nrevolutions\u201d, occasions when there are many incompatible\ntheories, all forced to develop through their competition with each\nother. But he downplayed the idea that theories are still compared\nwith one another primarily for their ability to account for the\nresults of observation and experiment. For Feyerabend, this idea was\nan empiricist myth which disguised the role of aesthetic and social\nfactors in theory-choice.\n\nThus far, the argument for theoretical pluralism largely follows that\nof John Stuart Mill\u2019s On Liberty (1859), to which\nFeyerabend often paid homage. But Feyerabend went on to try to\ndemonstrate a mechanism whereby theories can augment their empirical\ncontent. According to this part of the argument, theories may face\ndifficulties which can only be discovered with the help of alternative\ntheories. A theory can be incorrect without our being able to discover\nthis in a direct way: sometimes the construction of new experimental\nmethods and instruments which would reveal the incorrectness is\nexcluded by laws of nature, sometimes the discrepancy (were it to be\ndiscovered) might be regarded as an oddity, and might never be given\nits correct interpretation. Circumstances can thus conspire to hide\nfrom us the infirmities of our theory. The methodological\n\u201cprinciple of testability\u201d demands that we develop\nalternative theories incompatible with the existing theory, and\ndevelop them in their strongest form, as descriptions of reality, not\nmere instruments of prediction. Instead of waiting until the current\ntheory gets into difficulties, and only then starting to look for\nalternatives, we ought vigorously to proliferate theories and\ntenaciously defend them in the hope that they may afford us an\nindirect refutation of our existing theory. Only theories\nwhich are empirically adequate will thus contribute to raising the\nempirical content of their fellows. But Feyerabend insists that\nany theory, no matter how weak, may become\nempirically adequate, and so may contribute to this process. To be a\nrealist, he therefore suggests, involves demanding support for any\ntheory, including implausible conjectures having no independent\nempirical support, conjectures which are inconsistent with data and\nwell-confirmed laws. We should retain theories that are in trouble,\nand invent and develop theories that contradict the observed\nphenomena, just because in doing so we will be respecting the\nintellectual ideal of testability.\n\nIn thus appealing to the \u201cprinciple of testability\u201d as the\nsupreme methodological maxim, Feyerabend forgets that testability must\nbe traded-off against other theoretical virtues. Only his pathological\nfear of theories losing their empirical content and becoming myths\nleads him to want to maximise testability and embrace an absolutely\nunrestricted principle of proliferation. He also disregards historical\nevidence that anti-realist approaches can be just as pluralistic as\nrealism.\n\nAt Alpbach in 1964, Feyerabend and Feigl jointly directed a seminar on\nthe recent development of analytic philosophy. There Feyerabend\nre-encountered the leading light of the Logical Positivist movement,\nRudolph Carnap (whom he had already met at UCLA). Carnap tried to\nconvince Feyerabend of the virtues of clarity, but failed. Feyerabend\nwas still attached to \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, and\nconsidered philosophy worthless unless it made a positive and\nquantifiable contribution to the growth of knowledge (which, of\ncourse, meant science).\n\nBut a seminar in Hamburg in 1965, at which Feyerabend discussed the\nfoundations of quantum theory with the physicist C.F. von\nWeizs\u00e4cker, did have a lasting, if somewhat delayed, impact:\n\nVon Weizs\u00e4cker showed how quantum mechanics arose from concrete\nresearch while I complained, on general methodological grounds, that\nimportant alternatives had been omitted. The arguments supporting my\ncomplaint were quite good\u2026 but it was suddenly clear to me that\nimposed without regard to circumstances they were a hindrance rather\nthan a help: a person trying to solve a problem whether in science or\nelsewhere must be given complete freedom and cannot be\nrestricted by any demands, norms, however plausible they may seem to\nthe logician or the philosopher who has thought them out in the\nprivacy of his study. Norms and demands must be checked by research,\nnot by appeal to theories of rationality. In a lengthy article I\nexplained how Bohr had used this philosophy and how it differs from\nmore abstract procedures. Thus Professor von Weizs\u00e4cker has prime\nresponsibility for my change to \u201canarchism\u201d\u2014though\nhe was not at all pleased when I told him so in 1977. (SFS,\np. 117).\n\n",
